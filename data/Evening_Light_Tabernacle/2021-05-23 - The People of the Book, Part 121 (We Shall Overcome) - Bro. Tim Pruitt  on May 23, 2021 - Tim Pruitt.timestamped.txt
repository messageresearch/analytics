[55:42] and the word of god is a living word
[55:44] it's alive to bring forth what it was
[55:47] sent to do
[55:50] lord we know that it must accomplish
[55:52] what it's been
[55:53] released for and there was words that
[55:56] has been
[55:57] released for our day scripture
[56:00] that has been made alive that has been
[56:03] enlightened
[56:04] that light has shone on pages of the
[56:08] word that was
[56:09] written and maybe has been left in
[56:12] obscurity for years and years and years
[56:15] as men did not
[56:16] know its meanings but we come into a
[56:19] time where
[56:20] light is shining on the word of god
[56:23] and illuminating every promise from
[56:25] genesis to revelation
[56:27] and we pray lord that you'll illuminate
[56:29] it to our hearts today
[56:31] that you'll reveal yourself to us
[56:33] through the word we pray
[56:35] heal the sick among us lord those out on
[56:38] the
[56:39] internet and around the world that are
[56:42] in need today and they need a touch
[56:44] i pray that you'll touch them lord may
[56:47] they
[56:48] realize that even though they can't be
[56:51] in
[56:51] physically here in the service that by
[56:54] the holy spirit
[56:56] by the work of grace that they can enter
[56:58] into
[57:00] an atmosphere of believing where that
[57:03] all things are possible to them that
[57:05] believe
[57:07] i ask lord that you'll minister to every
[57:09] person that is here you see the guests
[57:11] that's in our midst today
[57:13] as well as those that did not get to
[57:16] attend for one reason or another
[57:17] not in the service i pray that you had
[57:20] blessed them all
[57:22] and lord we commit it in your hand i'm
[57:24] your servant lord i can only do
[57:27] as you will anoint but when the
[57:30] anointing comes anointing will break the
[57:32] yoke
[57:33] so break the yoke of every sin doubt and
[57:36] unbelief
[57:37] in jesus name we pray amen
[57:40] amen god bless you if you will turn with
[57:44] me to
[57:45] daniel chapter 12 and verse 1
[57:48] we actually left off on this last
[57:51] week as we concluded our service
[57:54] and trust in today that we can just um
[57:57] receive something from the lord we're
[57:59] going to be speaking today
[58:03] we had spoke last week on the lord is a
[58:06] man of war
[58:07] and this this week we are today we're
[58:10] going to be speaking on we
[58:11] shall overcome amen
[58:15] so knowing if the lord is on our side
[58:18] then
[58:18] who or what can be against us amen
[58:22] daniel chapter 12 and verse 1 we want to
[58:25] read from there today
[58:28] and at that time shall michael stand up
[58:31] the great prince which standeth for the
[58:33] children of thy people
[58:34] and there shall be a time of trouble
[58:36] such as never was since there was a
[58:38] nation
[58:40] even to that time and at that time thy
[58:42] people shall be delivered
[58:44] every one that should be found written
[58:46] in the book
[58:47] and many of them that sleep in the dust
[58:50] of the earth shall awake
[58:52] some to everlasting life and some to
[58:55] shame and everlasting contempt
[58:57] and they that be wise shall will shall
[59:00] shine
[59:00] as the brightness of the firmament and
[59:04] they that turn many to righteousness as
[59:06] the stars forever and ever
[59:08] but thou wilt daniel shut up the words
[59:11] and
[59:11] seal the book even to the time of the
[59:14] end
[59:15] many shall run to and fro and knowledge
[59:18] shall be increased amen we'll let you
[59:21] have your seats
[59:22] you pray for me as we look into the word
[59:25] today
[59:26] i just wanted to share with you a dream
[59:28] that i had on
[59:29] this past tuesday morning i woke up to
[59:32] this
[59:33] and just bask in the presence of the
[59:36] lord for a while but
[59:37] i was dreaming that i was going to meet
[59:39] him somewhere where i was going to
[59:41] preach and
[59:42] i was laying out things to take and i
[59:45] laid out a weapon
[59:46] it was a custom fit gun that just fit me
[59:49] perfectly
[59:51] and you know there was someone else that
[59:54] said in the dream that another gun would
[59:57] be better but i knew that gun would
[59:59] shot a pattern that would hit the target
[1:00:02] and every ball of lead
[1:00:03] in it from genesis to revelation would
[1:00:06] hit the target
[1:00:08] and i was demonstrating of how i could
[1:00:10] pick this gun up and shoulder
[1:00:12] and shoot it by instinct just by
[1:00:14] sighting the barrel and i could do it
[1:00:16] better
[1:00:17] and quicker with this gun that fit me
[1:00:20] and as i was in this dream as dreams go
[1:00:24] i
[1:00:24] i said timothy and i will be taking the
[1:00:26] meetings
[1:00:28] but i'm going to be preaching from the
[1:00:29] inspiration of christ the mystery of god
[1:00:31] revealed because brother branham said if
[1:00:33] you miss it
[1:00:35] come back to this tape and
[1:00:38] and i said then i said this is the
[1:00:41] threefold purpose and i went over them
[1:00:43] to reveal himself in christ
[1:00:45] to redeem a bride and to get preeminence
[1:00:48] in his people
[1:00:50] and then to take them back to eden and i
[1:00:53] and then and i the dream continued and i
[1:00:56] said this will fulfill his other great
[1:00:57] sermon of
[1:00:58] god in the universe god in his word god
[1:01:01] and his son and then finally god and his
[1:01:03] people
[1:01:05] and this will bring them back to eden
[1:01:07] condition
[1:01:08] and i'll tell you i i believe that we're
[1:01:11] living
[1:01:11] in a very wonderful hour and a very
[1:01:14] wonderful time where we're about to turn
[1:01:16] from time back into eternity
[1:01:20] so what an hour what a day that we are
[1:01:22] in
[1:01:23] it you know even our dreams our our
[1:01:26] things that we think upon
[1:01:28] begin to reflect this and i i thought as
[1:01:31] i read this scripture this morning from
[1:01:33] daniel chapter 12 that
[1:01:35] it was a time where
[1:01:38] there was a battle but in the heavens
[1:01:41] and this would be in the earlier
[1:01:45] chapters of daniel where
[1:01:47] daniel had set his face to pray and he
[1:01:50] wanted to know
[1:01:51] exactly what god was doing in that hour
[1:01:55] of fulfilling the word of promise that
[1:01:57] had been given
[1:01:59] and so he set his face to pray and to
[1:02:02] fast and
[1:02:03] you know it was many days before he got
[1:02:05] an answer
[1:02:07] and yet um he received a
[1:02:10] finally an angel came to him that
[1:02:14] told him daniel you are greatly beloved
[1:02:18] i want you just to think of this just
[1:02:19] because that you are hanging on to
[1:02:22] promise don't give up on it amen
[1:02:25] the the message finally comes through
[1:02:28] your greatly
[1:02:29] beloved and he said i would have been
[1:02:32] here from the day you prayed but
[1:02:34] there was a battle in the heavens and
[1:02:37] this battle in the heavens delayed my
[1:02:39] coming
[1:02:40] and i would not be here except for
[1:02:42] michael the archangel came to help me
[1:02:45] and so and and so you know this
[1:02:49] sets the stage for daniel chapter 12
[1:02:52] where that michael now is
[1:02:55] is standing up and it shows um
[1:02:59] that there has been a battle in heaven
[1:03:02] and
[1:03:03] then as he stands up where he arises
[1:03:06] he stands up the great prince which
[1:03:08] standeth for the children of thy people
[1:03:10] and that word stand up means to rise to
[1:03:13] come on the scene
[1:03:15] to stand forth to appear to rise against
[1:03:18] or rise up and rise against so
[1:03:22] you know it's a it's an hour where that
[1:03:25] we're living in
[1:03:26] a time of trouble as the bible said like
[1:03:29] there's never been
[1:03:30] and you can expect things to get worse
[1:03:34] and worse and worse as we face the end
[1:03:37] time
[1:03:38] but you remember it's in that hour that
[1:03:41] michael stands up
[1:03:43] and he arises and of course when he does
[1:03:46] i want you to notice that he tells us
[1:03:49] already you know the outcome of the
[1:03:52] battle
[1:03:53] and thy people shall be delivered
[1:03:56] this word delivered means they shall
[1:03:59] escape
[1:04:00] and you remember the rapture um is very
[1:04:03] much similar to
[1:04:04] the red sea that we have been preaching
[1:04:06] about where they escaped through the red
[1:04:09] sea and it closed up upon the enemy and
[1:04:12] they were on the other side and
[1:04:14] and the rapture is very much an escape
[1:04:17] up from the things that are coming up on
[1:04:19] the earth the bible said that you should
[1:04:22] pray always that you might be accounted
[1:04:24] worthy
[1:04:25] to escape the things that are coming
[1:04:28] upon the earth
[1:04:29] because he said that like a snare it
[1:04:32] shall come upon the earth
[1:04:33] and he said don't be caught with drunken
[1:04:36] and sophieting and
[1:04:38] and the cares of this life
[1:04:41] don't let that overtake you but get
[1:04:44] ready to
[1:04:45] leave from here and i think if there was
[1:04:48] ever a time that we should prepare to go
[1:04:51] forward
[1:04:52] to go through to to to meet
[1:04:55] the challenge of the hour it is now
[1:04:58] and the bible said that every one that
[1:05:01] shall be found
[1:05:03] written in the book shall be delivered
[1:05:06] so
[1:05:06] if you notice here a bible uh
[1:05:10] michael's standing up a book and
[1:05:13] everyone whose name in the
[1:05:15] written in the book shall be delivered
[1:05:17] so this
[1:05:18] this again as we was paralleling with
[1:05:21] with it last week
[1:05:22] with revelation chapter 5 and we will
[1:05:25] speak up just a little bit about that
[1:05:27] again today
[1:05:28] but i i want you just to to to kind of
[1:05:32] understand that we are here in the
[1:05:35] fulfilling
[1:05:36] of these prophecies the things that were
[1:05:39] written before time
[1:05:41] they were written for our admonition
[1:05:44] and to prepare us for the end time where
[1:05:47] we could see
[1:05:48] that god has the road map already
[1:05:50] written out in his bible
[1:05:53] now the bible said that day that be wise
[1:05:57] that means um that day that be wise
[1:06:00] shall shine and i want to just
[1:06:02] look on all of this for a moment they
[1:06:04] shall shine look
[1:06:06] they that be wise that word means to
[1:06:08] have insight
[1:06:09] wise means to have insight to have
[1:06:12] comprehension
[1:06:14] so there is a people that will actually
[1:06:17] comprehend or have revelation
[1:06:20] of what god is saying now remember this
[1:06:22] is christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:06:24] brother branham
[1:06:25] established it totally through that
[1:06:27] sermon that
[1:06:29] it is it is not a group a
[1:06:32] revelation it is not something you get
[1:06:35] from an organization
[1:06:36] it is in teachings that is passed down
[1:06:39] it is absolutely a
[1:06:41] revelation of jesus christ personally to
[1:06:44] you
[1:06:45] and so again they that be wise that
[1:06:49] has this insight that has the ears to
[1:06:52] hear
[1:06:53] what the spirit is saying that has eyes
[1:06:55] to see
[1:06:56] when the rest of the world is blinded
[1:06:59] that has comprehension because they have
[1:07:02] the mind of god
[1:07:03] that these that are wise they shall
[1:07:07] shine and that word shine means to warn
[1:07:10] to teach to shine to send out a light
[1:07:13] to be shining there as the brightness of
[1:07:16] the permanent
[1:07:17] as all the stars of the heavens and this
[1:07:20] word stars means right here the brothers
[1:07:23] of the messiah
[1:07:24] amen so we'll shine as the brothers of
[1:07:27] the messiah think about
[1:07:29] this day there's a people who will shine
[1:07:32] as abraham shown in his day as he stood
[1:07:36] out from among the heathen
[1:07:38] as isaac jacob joseph all the
[1:07:41] the men down to the bible elijah moses
[1:07:45] whoever they were the stars before us
[1:07:48] they met the sons of the messiah amen
[1:07:52] as they have shown also will the wise in
[1:07:55] this day
[1:07:56] shine as sons of the messiah
[1:08:00] they've been doing exploits in this day
[1:08:03] and then because they are the stars that
[1:08:06] shine forever
[1:08:07] and ever as brothers of the messiah now
[1:08:10] remember from last sunday that this
[1:08:13] is again the pentecost of pentecost it
[1:08:17] is the jubilee of jubilees
[1:08:19] and let me show you what god is doing at
[1:08:21] this pentecost is
[1:08:23] where he stands up and and
[1:08:26] and as an as an overcomer as a mighty
[1:08:30] conqueror
[1:08:31] as a bloody lamb notice revelation 5
[1:08:35] shows him as the the oh
[1:08:38] hymn that has overcome death hell and
[1:08:41] the grave
[1:08:42] revelation 5 and 6 and i beheld in the
[1:08:45] midst
[1:08:46] of the throne and of the four beasts and
[1:08:48] in the midst of the elders
[1:08:50] stood a lamb as it had been slain
[1:08:54] so you have daniel 12 which is michael
[1:08:56] standing up you have the lamb now
[1:08:58] standing
[1:08:59] but notice he doesn't stand as a
[1:09:02] victim he doesn't stand as one who
[1:09:06] is dead a dead lamb doesn't stand
[1:09:09] but he was slain but in
[1:09:12] his death he won a victory
[1:09:16] amen and verse 9 tells us that the
[1:09:20] the victory the lamb's victory has
[1:09:22] redeemed us to god
[1:09:24] by that blood out of every kindred and
[1:09:27] tongue
[1:09:28] and people and nation and has made us
[1:09:31] unto our god kings and priests and we
[1:09:34] shall reign
[1:09:35] on the earth amen now this is what
[1:09:39] the message of god does for us as the
[1:09:42] lamb
[1:09:42] stands up notice what he does he redeems
[1:09:45] us
[1:09:46] but he makes us into our god have a
[1:09:49] dominion
[1:09:50] we reign as kings and priests
[1:09:53] and it's not just something that's going
[1:09:56] to happen in the far off
[1:09:58] or by and by way outshonder in the great
[1:10:01] future but we shall
[1:10:02] reign on the earth
[1:10:05] amen we'll reign over the flesh over sin
[1:10:09] over the devil over our own earth
[1:10:12] now so when when this message was
[1:10:16] given i want you to remember it was a
[1:10:19] declaration of war against
[1:10:22] the the established systems of the day
[1:10:26] against the satanic kingdoms it was a
[1:10:30] declaration of war that
[1:10:32] was was a trumpet call for every one of
[1:10:35] us to prepare for battle
[1:10:37] amen now remember this brother branham
[1:10:40] told us in the fifth seal the angel of
[1:10:42] god
[1:10:43] um this is first seal the angel of god
[1:10:46] catches the mystery of god not yet fully
[1:10:48] revealed
[1:10:49] and but when he does he catches the
[1:10:51] mystery of god and
[1:10:53] then goes forth to the people after the
[1:10:55] mystery has been given to him
[1:10:57] he goes forth to the people what does he
[1:10:59] do there he proclaims
[1:11:01] a message and what does it do what does
[1:11:04] it start
[1:11:05] it starts a war a spiritual
[1:11:08] war now remember this time
[1:11:12] this last day that we are in is a time
[1:11:16] of war and the message that you have
[1:11:19] received
[1:11:20] is a call to battle it is a trumpet call
[1:11:25] preparing yourself for battle amen now
[1:11:29] you can see it's not just in the
[1:11:31] physical but it's also
[1:11:33] in the heavenlies because again
[1:11:36] the angels themselves are
[1:11:39] there there's war in heaven
[1:11:42] amen and we're going to be looking at
[1:11:45] this this morning a little bit later
[1:11:47] in revelation 12 but right now i want
[1:11:49] you to understand that
[1:11:51] we are in a battle and we're depicted
[1:11:54] you know
[1:11:54] of uh of how we will be in this battle
[1:11:58] what the battle array will be now i want
[1:12:01] you to see him
[1:12:02] when he comes with his army to take the
[1:12:05] world over for the millennium this is
[1:12:07] going to be a future scripture
[1:12:09] but the scripture as i said does not
[1:12:11] pertain to now but
[1:12:13] when he comes back with his saints and
[1:12:14] we're talking about revelation 19
[1:12:17] and verse 11 and he says and i saw
[1:12:21] heaven open and behold a white horse and
[1:12:24] he that sat upon him
[1:12:26] was called faithful and true we heard
[1:12:29] last
[1:12:30] wednesday night on the faithful god this
[1:12:33] is him coming he is faithful and he is
[1:12:36] true and in righteousness he to judge
[1:12:40] and make war i want you to understand
[1:12:43] our god is a warrior god and he is
[1:12:46] leading
[1:12:47] us into battle this is not a time
[1:12:50] of making peace with the enemy this is a
[1:12:53] time
[1:12:54] of battle a great war a great strike
[1:12:58] there is strife in the earth there is
[1:13:01] strife
[1:13:01] in the heavens amen everywhere that you
[1:13:05] whoever where you look there is a
[1:13:06] conflict we see
[1:13:08] the forces of hell that is gathered and
[1:13:11] brother branham would tell us
[1:13:12] all hell is against this teaching
[1:13:15] so we know all of hell we can see the
[1:13:18] raid on many fronts
[1:13:20] we can see it there with the perversion
[1:13:22] of sodom
[1:13:23] we can see it there in our government in
[1:13:25] the perversion of our laws
[1:13:27] we can see it in the world condition
[1:13:30] as nations gather themselves against
[1:13:33] jerusalem and
[1:13:34] the world criticizes her even defending
[1:13:37] her own self

[1:14:49] stand there and you're gonna resist the
[1:14:51] devil

[1:15:26] are you with me and his eyes
[1:15:29] was as a flame of fire we're just going
[1:15:33] to stop here
[1:15:34] just a moment let's let's just kind of
[1:15:37] uh
[1:15:38] digest some of this ruminate on it for a
[1:15:42] little bit
[1:15:43] his eyes were as a flame of fire dude
[1:15:46] did you notice last sunday we were
[1:15:48] talking about him looking through
[1:15:50] the pillar of fire when he looked
[1:15:53] through that pillar of fire and he
[1:15:54] judged the egyptians and then
[1:15:58] he declared war on him saying that your
[1:16:01] enemy
[1:16:02] that you have had the egyptians that
[1:16:05] you've seen your
[1:16:06] slave masters you will see them
[1:16:09] from this day no more
[1:16:12] amen and and so his eyes
[1:16:15] are a flame of fire so when he looks
[1:16:19] through the pillar of fire and i want
[1:16:21] you to i want you to remember
[1:16:24] and bring this connection because
[1:16:27] this is the day that we saw vividly
[1:16:30] the pillar of fire and his picture was
[1:16:34] taken
[1:16:36] in mind his his identification was their
[1:16:39] service after service and we saw what he
[1:16:42] did when he looked through the pillar of
[1:16:43] fire
[1:16:44] and when glottal looks through the
[1:16:47] pillar of fire
[1:16:48] every thought is exposed
[1:16:51] no demon can hide faith or unbelief is
[1:16:55] revealed
[1:16:56] every sin that is exposed are you with
[1:16:59] me
[1:17:00] amen like like when i i was a young boy
[1:17:03] i was in jack moore's
[1:17:05] church and like tabernacle we didn't
[1:17:07] attend there but i went to this meeting
[1:17:09] where that mr teenage america was that
[1:17:12] came to
[1:17:13] life tabernacle and his claim to fame
[1:17:16] was
[1:17:16] demonstrating his great strength by
[1:17:19] taking this report phone book which is
[1:17:21] about time
[1:17:22] at that time was about as thick as my
[1:17:24] bible his
[1:17:25] was a big book we don't have that's
[1:17:27] almost obsolete you hardly know what a
[1:17:29] phone book is anymore
[1:17:31] but anyway you know they that mr teenage
[1:17:34] america
[1:17:35] he would demonstrate his great strength
[1:17:38] before everybody by taking
[1:17:40] and tearing a shreveport phone book in
[1:17:43] two
[1:17:44] and and so i i saw him do that at live
[1:17:47] tabernacle as i said at jack morris
[1:17:50] church
[1:17:51] and then just a little later in brother
[1:17:54] branson's meetings or right about that
[1:17:56] time
[1:17:57] in the presence of the pillar of fire i
[1:18:00] want you to get this
[1:18:02] looking through that brother bradham
[1:18:04] turned to him on the platform
[1:18:06] and and he said you know about last
[1:18:09] night
[1:18:10] and he cried out oh god forgive me
[1:18:15] and brother branham said well since
[1:18:16] you've asked forgiveness i won't expose
[1:18:18] you
[1:18:20] all right amen now this was witness
[1:18:24] this is actually not on tape but it was
[1:18:26] witnessed by
[1:18:27] people that were there are you with me
[1:18:30] amen but what was it it was in the
[1:18:33] presence
[1:18:34] of the pillar of fire as brother
[1:18:37] as sister jamie camp was there in that
[1:18:40] meeting and went through the prayer line
[1:18:43] and someone a lady just before desiring
[1:18:45] a baby
[1:18:46] and brother branham said but you've got
[1:18:48] a habit that you need to get rid of and
[1:18:50] that's smoking
[1:18:52] what was it it was looking through the
[1:18:54] pillar of fire
[1:18:56] and finding the root of unbelief
[1:19:00] that with his symptoms of sin which was
[1:19:02] smoking
[1:19:03] and it was exposed so that she could be
[1:19:06] delivered
[1:19:08] are you with me and when sicknesses were
[1:19:10] exposed
[1:19:11] over and over and over again devils
[1:19:15] couldn't hide i i just went as i was
[1:19:18] reminiscing on this and thinking of it i
[1:19:21] went back and i
[1:19:22] thought of some of the prayer lines
[1:19:24] where brother bradley said i
[1:19:26] can't see some kind of room it's it's a
[1:19:29] white looking oh you were operated on
[1:19:32] and um you know you they've done
[1:19:35] something
[1:19:36] the doctors have it's caused a bowel
[1:19:38] condition
[1:19:39] isn't that right they made a mistake
[1:19:41] there but god is here to correct it
[1:19:44] you believe it satan you thought you
[1:19:47] could hide from the doctor
[1:19:48] but you can't hide from god come out of
[1:19:51] the woman in the name of jesus christ
[1:19:54] so you know it not only you know it
[1:19:57] exposed
[1:19:58] even the mistake the doctors made
[1:20:01] are you with me it showed right down
[1:20:04] into the operating room
[1:20:06] it shows that once god looks to the
[1:20:09] pillar of fire
[1:20:10] he can see every sin every
[1:20:13] fault every problem
[1:20:16] because he does judge come on
[1:20:19] and then he made war satan you thought
[1:20:23] you could hide from the doctrine and the
[1:20:26] the
[1:20:27] diseases and devils they do a pretty
[1:20:29] good job of
[1:20:30] hiding from the doctors but he said you
[1:20:33] can't
[1:20:34] hide from god come out of the woman
[1:20:39] now again you know um
[1:20:42] many times that these spirits would call
[1:20:46] out to each other i remember and i told
[1:20:48] this before but
[1:20:50] i used to preach when i was a lot
[1:20:53] younger
[1:20:53] back in the 70s early 70s in fact
[1:20:57] wayne lawson when i was in some of my
[1:21:00] meetings as a five-year-old boy and
[1:21:02] he could remember me kept me coming he
[1:21:04] said you had something on your foot
[1:21:06] brother tim
[1:21:07] said i remember that and then i
[1:21:10] had had surgeries and i was in a walking
[1:21:13] cast and i was preaching for henry
[1:21:15] darris
[1:21:16] a revival meeting and a walking cast
[1:21:19] and and so as i as i was preaching
[1:21:22] this meeting uh you know then
[1:21:26] then um brother darris shared with me a
[1:21:29] personal testimony
[1:21:31] of how that he was in uh brother
[1:21:33] branham's meetings how he went there
[1:21:36] in in the early days in jonesboro
[1:21:39] on arkansas and he was in a tent meeting
[1:21:42] and he
[1:21:43] couldn't get a seat he had cancer and it
[1:21:46] was in his throat
[1:21:48] and it had ate and eaten out the lining
[1:21:51] of his throat and
[1:21:52] and he had difficulty there swallowing
[1:21:55] and because he was looking for healing
[1:22:00] he he was came and was leading up
[1:22:03] against the tent post
[1:22:05] and standing in the meeting because he
[1:22:07] couldn't get a seat
[1:22:08] and was wanting to be close so he found
[1:22:11] a place by
[1:22:12] tentpost and was standing there leaning
[1:22:14] against it
[1:22:15] and as the meeting went on there was a
[1:22:18] lady come in the prayer line or a person
[1:22:20] came in the prayer line
[1:22:21] and they had cancer in her body and his
[1:22:24] brother
[1:22:25] branham began to discern he said wait a
[1:22:27] minute he said there's a black streak
[1:22:30] going from this woman to that man
[1:22:34] right over there she has cancer and this
[1:22:37] man has cancer
[1:22:38] and the demon in this person is calling
[1:22:41] for the
[1:22:42] demon that is afflicting this man to
[1:22:45] to come and help and congregate for
[1:22:48] unbelief
[1:22:49] and he said but satan you have been
[1:22:51] exposed
[1:22:53] so come out of them in the name of jesus
[1:22:55] christ and henry darris was healed
[1:22:58] in that meeting because again
[1:23:01] god was looking through the pillar of
[1:23:04] fire
[1:23:05] calling things what they were now
[1:23:08] you see again i'm this is from one of
[1:23:11] the prayer lines brother brandon said
[1:23:13] moving up close to me now is comes the
[1:23:16] spirit of death
[1:23:17] it's black it's hideous the veil is
[1:23:20] parting back
[1:23:20] i see a woman examined is a cancer
[1:23:24] and it's come to take your life but
[1:23:27] jesus christ
[1:23:28] come to give you life and when
[1:23:32] who who do you believe tonight the lord
[1:23:34] jesus

[1:23:39] for the defeat of one of the arch
[1:23:42] enemies
[1:23:43] of the human race will you stand your
[1:23:45] feet doubt
[1:23:46] demon called cancer you might hide from
[1:23:49] the doctrine
[1:23:50] but you can't hide from god you're
[1:23:53] exposed
[1:23:54] come out of these people in the name of
[1:23:57] jesus christ
[1:23:58] you are defeated
[1:24:01] what was we showing we were showing a
[1:24:03] warrior god at work
[1:24:06] because in a time of trouble amen in a
[1:24:10] time when
[1:24:10] doctors can't do anything about it and
[1:24:13] then here he comes on the scene he
[1:24:15] stands up
[1:24:16] on the behalf of his people and don't
[1:24:19] keep this back in the past bring this
[1:24:22] right down to this
[1:24:23] building this morning or wherever you
[1:24:26] are sitting
[1:24:27] or staying at at this moment bring it
[1:24:29] right down to your pew
[1:24:31] or to your chair and remember there's a
[1:24:33] living god
[1:24:35] who is bringing that battle right down
[1:24:38] to your pew
[1:24:39] and then to defeat your enemy to
[1:24:41] overcome we
[1:24:43] shall not be defeated but we shall
[1:24:46] overcome
[1:24:47] [Applause]
[1:24:50] hallelujah
[1:24:53] the healing line brother branham said he
[1:24:56] talked to a man as he
[1:24:58] would often do it do and he said you
[1:25:01] know there's nothing i could do to help
[1:25:03] you
[1:25:05] in the way of healing you look like a
[1:25:06] good strong man to me
[1:25:09] but perhaps you're not i don't know but
[1:25:11] our lord jesus knows
[1:25:14] and he knows me and and if you believe
[1:25:17] that he's here his presence is here
[1:25:19] you believe he's here and then he said
[1:25:21] it's a cancerous condition
[1:25:24] now wait a minute the obvious signs on
[1:25:26] the outside
[1:25:27] was a healthy man
[1:25:33] but here when the pillar of fire looks
[1:25:36] at it
[1:25:38] he sees more than a healthy man
[1:25:41] he sees a demon hiding there
[1:25:45] a cancer's condition and then he points
[1:25:48] out to the audience and he says
[1:25:50] that man sitting right there has the
[1:25:51] same thing and these demons are
[1:25:53] screaming one to another
[1:25:55] for pity for mercy they're calling and
[1:25:58] so is the angel of god calling
[1:26:01] and the battle is here and now your
[1:26:05] faith will determine which way it goes
[1:26:11] and that's exactly the way it is in the
[1:26:12] battle your faith

[1:26:29] family this is the day
[1:26:31] the enemy stops right here
[1:26:36] the decision is yours

[1:29:47] somebody
[1:29:48] who will believe
[1:29:55] again i want to just bring this out
[1:29:57] because it shows
[1:29:59] not only the the disease but the sin
[1:30:03] many times he would say i see a black
[1:30:06] shadow but
[1:30:07] i see a darker shadow you're not a
[1:30:09] christian
[1:30:13] and the greater than solomon is here
[1:30:15] this is a 61 sermon he said
[1:30:18] i suppose we're strangers to one another
[1:30:20] you know how brother branham often did
[1:30:22] the lord jesus can reveal to me what
[1:30:25] your trouble is will you believe me
[1:30:26] i hate to tell you this you want me to
[1:30:30] tell you anyhow
[1:30:31] you're shadowed cancer you're shattered
[1:30:34] to death
[1:30:36] you had some habits to give up
[1:30:41] that you've got to give up that's right
[1:30:43] will you do it
[1:30:45] let me show you i feel another spirit
[1:30:47] coming in the devil you're trying to get
[1:30:49] right with god now here this person's
[1:30:52] trying to get right with god
[1:30:54] he said frankly you just got baptized to
[1:30:57] get straight
[1:31:01] so he's already making steps toward it
[1:31:04] but again a dark shadow was still over
[1:31:07] them and they still had habits
[1:31:09] to give up you see again
[1:31:13] the light is shining the eyes
[1:31:16] as a flame of fire this is also
[1:31:18] described in
[1:31:19] revelation chapter one his eyes are as a
[1:31:22] flame of fire
[1:31:23] this is what we have seen him as
[1:31:26] in this generation amen
[1:31:30] he not only sees the sins and diseases
[1:31:32] of the people
[1:31:34] but he sees the sins and the diseases of
[1:31:36] the church
[1:31:38] who was steeped in unbelief and darkness
[1:31:41] of creeds and darkness
[1:31:43] and was able to discern the unbelief
[1:31:48] to bring us back to faith again
[1:31:51] and he said let me show you something i
[1:31:53] feel another spirit in
[1:31:54] in here you're trying to get right with
[1:31:56] god frankly you've just been baptized
[1:31:58] that lady there and he points to the
[1:32:00] congregation will you be
[1:32:02] with leukemia you believe jesus christ
[1:32:04] will make you well if you have faith
[1:32:06] he will do you you accept it you believe
[1:32:09] he'll heal you and make you well
[1:32:10] if you've got a prayer card and she said
[1:32:12] no and he said you don't
[1:32:14] well it's a cancer too sister you don't
[1:32:16] have to have a prayer card
[1:32:17] raise up your hand to christ and say the
[1:32:19] lady's sitting there with a little red
[1:32:21] coat
[1:32:22] laying across their laps don't you see
[1:32:24] that light hanging over that woman
[1:32:26] i want to ask you something you be
[1:32:28] honest with me when i spoke
[1:32:29] cancer and death something strange
[1:32:32] happened to you
[1:32:34] is that right you had a funny feeling
[1:32:36] like come over you is that right
[1:32:38] if that's right then wave your hands to
[1:32:40] the people see
[1:32:42] it's death too on that woman
[1:32:45] it's leukemia or that's what the doctor
[1:32:47] said
[1:32:48] and he's right and you both are under
[1:32:52] the shadows of death
[1:32:54] this dar that dark streak coming from
[1:32:56] this one
[1:32:58] what is it it's a that devil in here
[1:33:00] that's called
[1:33:01] cancer cancer's a medical word means a
[1:33:04] crab
[1:33:04] but it's a devil it's a killer it's a
[1:33:06] tormentor is on this man and in that
[1:33:09] woman
[1:33:09] and he was calling for help to try to
[1:33:11] get this man to disbelieve it
[1:33:14] and the holy spirit beat him to it and
[1:33:16] threw faith on the woman
[1:33:18] and she touched something and the devil
[1:33:21] thought he could get
[1:33:22] by with it but when you both believe on
[1:33:26] jesus christ and accept him as your
[1:33:27] healer
[1:33:28] then in the name of jesus christ i
[1:33:30] condemn that devil to leave you
[1:33:32] both and you go and be well in the name
[1:33:34] of jesus christ
[1:33:36] what was it again god looking through
[1:33:40] the pillar of fire discerning the hearts
[1:33:44] even what the doctor said and the doctor
[1:33:46] said it's leukemia
[1:33:48] but then he said and he's right
[1:33:52] now you see again this is
[1:33:56] this is something that we got to
[1:33:57] understand church
[1:33:59] that we're living in a day in a time
[1:34:02] where that god has turned
[1:34:05] the fire and looking at his enemy
[1:34:10] he is seeing the enemy now as for what
[1:34:13] he really is
[1:34:15] it's a time where he dresses as the
[1:34:18] avenger
[1:34:20] as he starts to finish his redemption
[1:34:22] work
[1:34:23] oh brother i can't wait till the day he
[1:34:26] looks on our bodies
[1:34:29] and he avenges us of every gray hair
[1:34:32] of every false teeth of every
[1:34:36] eye trouble come on of every joint
[1:34:38] problem
[1:34:39] and man as he changes us from mortal to
[1:34:41] immortality
[1:34:42] i can't wait because we're living in a
[1:34:44] time the pillar of fire
[1:34:46] is about to direct its attention right
[1:34:48] on mortality
[1:34:50] itself are you with me
[1:34:53] amen now so you see the this is
[1:34:56] this is where that there is a battle
[1:34:59] that is going on every service
[1:35:01] was a battle every service you come to
[1:35:04] is a battle
[1:35:06] you're going to be battle against
[1:35:08] unbelief
[1:35:09] you're going to be battle against
[1:35:11] thoughts you're going to be
[1:35:13] battling against a sleepy devil
[1:35:16] you know you're going to be battling
[1:35:18] against the tiredness of this
[1:35:20] age and the weariness of your flesh
[1:35:23] you're going to be battling you're going
[1:35:24] to be battling on every front
[1:35:27] but i want you to remember we shall
[1:35:31] overcome and remember because we're
[1:35:34] not in this battle alone i guarantee you
[1:35:37] if you start praying right in your seat
[1:35:39] right now
[1:35:40] god come to my side amen let me see you
[1:35:43] in your power
[1:35:45] come to my pew right now and you seek
[1:35:48] god come in a miraculous way
[1:35:50] to touch your heart to change your life
[1:35:53] to change situations
[1:35:58] now satan hates to be exposed
[1:36:01] and that's why when you have two books
[1:36:04] in the bible the book of genesis and the
[1:36:06] book of revelation
[1:36:07] that those two books exposes the devil
[1:36:11] amen more than any other books
[1:36:14] in the bible and satan hates them he
[1:36:17] hates
[1:36:18] genesis he tries his best to
[1:36:21] to do everything he can to discredit it
[1:36:26] amen to say it isn't right
[1:36:29] to question the creation to question the
[1:36:33] god
[1:36:34] of creation amen
[1:36:37] you know i i i heard i i read the other
[1:36:40] day where somebody said who wants to
[1:36:42] believe
[1:36:43] in some phony belief if you eat a fruit
[1:36:45] from a magic tree and all men die
[1:36:50] well i understand their pain
[1:36:53] who doesn't want to believe that it's
[1:36:55] not a magic fruit it was sin in the
[1:36:57] garden
[1:37:00] and but it's been exposed
[1:37:04] all the fairy tales come on
[1:37:08] and mythology that tried to attach
[1:37:10] itself to the book
[1:37:13] has been exposed and now we know what
[1:37:16] the real sin in the garden was
[1:37:19] amen now again again you see
[1:37:23] again the reason he hates
[1:37:26] genesis and revelation is because both
[1:37:29] of them
[1:37:29] expose it it shows his beginning and it
[1:37:33] shows us
[1:37:33] in and i'm reading i'm going to be
[1:37:36] reading in revelation 12 in a minute
[1:37:39] which shows you the casting down of
[1:37:41] satan
[1:37:42] because it shows his defeat
[1:37:45] amen you are a people that already know
[1:37:48] the outcome of the battle
[1:37:50] before you go in there but that wasn't
[1:37:53] unique to you this is what he told
[1:37:55] israel
[1:37:56] amen i give you that land amen it's a
[1:38:00] good land and you will drive
[1:38:02] them out and i'm gonna go before you and
[1:38:05] i will lead you in the battle
[1:38:08] amen and you will drive them out i've
[1:38:10] given you this land
[1:38:11] they already know that victory is theirs
[1:38:15] before they even fight the first fight
[1:38:19] are you with me but unbelief would keep
[1:38:23] them from the promise they would take
[1:38:25] the promise and not mix it with faith
[1:38:28] and this would keep them out of the
[1:38:29] divine promise
[1:38:34] now remember when the church disbelieves
[1:38:37] satan
[1:38:38] and believes the spirit's revelation of
[1:38:40] the word the gates of hell
[1:38:42] cannot prevail against her
[1:38:45] that's why that god does these things in
[1:38:48] this day
[1:38:49] revelation revelation revealing the
[1:38:51] thoughts revealing the hearts
[1:38:52] revealing the word if you can have
[1:38:55] confidence that he knows
[1:38:57] the heart that he knows the thought
[1:39:01] that he can judge the sin that he can
[1:39:05] tell
[1:39:05] the diseases that he can call the name
[1:39:11] if you can have confidence that he knows
[1:39:13] the address
[1:39:15] then you surely got to have confidence
[1:39:17] he knows his word
[1:39:19] and his word is even more vital
[1:39:22] importance
[1:39:23] to be revealed to the people at the end
[1:39:25] time than the problem you have in your
[1:39:27] life
[1:39:29] amen so so again you know even when
[1:39:33] names are called and diseases revealed
[1:39:35] satan hates it and that's one thing
[1:39:39] you know satan is doing everything he
[1:39:40] can to undermine
[1:39:42] the revelation and the authority of the
[1:39:45] word he's doing everything he can
[1:39:47] to get you to doubt to bring confusion
[1:39:52] amen but but now notice again
[1:39:56] you know you know he it can discern
[1:40:00] diseases it can expose the devil
[1:40:04] remember what about faith can't the holy
[1:40:06] spirit recognize
[1:40:07] faith you know when god looks to the
[1:40:10] eyes of the pillar of fire
[1:40:12] can he tell that you are a believer
[1:40:18] he could tell that some were sinners
[1:40:21] i mean he could tell what their disease
[1:40:23] was
[1:40:24] he could tell their habits some of them
[1:40:27] he would have to move away from the
[1:40:28] microphone
[1:40:30] and say you know i remember and as i was
[1:40:33] with moses he talks to betty
[1:40:35] daughtery and and she had been healed in
[1:40:38] an earlier meeting now she's a
[1:40:39] grown woman that was when she's a child
[1:40:42] now she's a grown woman
[1:40:43] and something had come up and he pulled
[1:40:45] her aside he said
[1:40:46] are you living for god betty is
[1:40:48] everything right between you and he
[1:40:50] pulls her aside
[1:40:51] i don't know what he tells her
[1:40:54] but her heart is exposed
[1:40:57] he says i want to look deep down in your
[1:41:00] soul now
[1:41:07] you know this this is when hypocrisy
[1:41:11] and hypocrites and the facade
[1:41:14] is all stripped away and you're naked
[1:41:21] exposed
[1:41:25] now wait a minute brother branham told
[1:41:27] us we're one of the last things he says
[1:41:30] in the message communion when the last
[1:41:32] sermon he leaves us
[1:41:35] just like jesus took communion with his
[1:41:37] disciples went to the cross
[1:41:39] went to his death brother branham takes
[1:41:41] communion and goes
[1:41:42] to his death and the last sermon in
[1:41:46] communion
[1:41:47] he comes right down to it and he says
[1:41:52] church there's going to be an anonymous
[1:41:54] sapphire
[1:41:55] repeat sin
[1:41:58] is not going to be allowed to stay in
[1:42:00] the presence of believers
[1:42:05] a day when playing church is over with
[1:42:10] hiding sin and the pew under the cloak
[1:42:13] of religion
[1:42:16] amen when god looks through those eyes
[1:42:19] of the pillar of our can he tell
[1:42:21] that you are a believer as brother
[1:42:24] branham said
[1:42:25] you know and i'm just going to go
[1:42:27] through some of these for a moment
[1:42:29] just to kind of show you he says in the
[1:42:31] prayer line you are a christian believer
[1:42:33] because your spirit feels so welcome
[1:42:37] and i know this is the holy spirit here
[1:42:40] and i know it
[1:42:41] welcomes you
[1:42:45] hallelujah think about that you
[1:42:49] welcomed by the holy spirit
[1:42:52] amen inviting you into his presence
[1:42:58] i suppose we're strange with each other
[1:43:00] we don't know one another but you're a
[1:43:02] believer
[1:43:02] i can tell just as soon as you come here
[1:43:05] your faith
[1:43:06] is welcoming to me and i know you're a
[1:43:09] christian
[1:43:12] again i perceive now you're a christian
[1:43:14] because
[1:43:15] your spirit feels welcome
[1:43:18] and i know it's a christian spirit in
[1:43:21] you and god knows
[1:43:22] all about you isn't that right she's
[1:43:25] feeling the presence of his being which
[1:43:26] is
[1:43:27] going to her she's a christian a
[1:43:28] believer a spirit-filled christian
[1:43:30] and she's believing and that's why she's
[1:43:33] feeling the operation of that being
[1:43:35] standing near her is that right lady
[1:43:37] you're a believer that is right because
[1:43:39] your spirit is welcome
[1:43:41] the angel of the lord which is now on
[1:43:44] both of
[1:43:45] us is making me see your spirit
[1:43:49] is welcoming
[1:43:52] amen
[1:43:57] no wonder he comes when two or more
[1:43:59] gather in his name
[1:44:03] because they welcome him
[1:44:06] they invite him they want him
[1:44:10] they're calling through night to me
[1:44:13] come to me oppressor savior
[1:44:17] evan come to me again he said as soon as
[1:44:20] i go to talk and
[1:44:21] i find out one thing about you you're a
[1:44:23] christian believer
[1:44:24] you're a christian because your spirit
[1:44:26] is welcome and i feel the anointing of
[1:44:28] the holy spirit that you're a born-again
[1:44:30] believer that's right
[1:44:31] because your spirit feels welcome to the
[1:44:33] angel of the lord
[1:44:36] my goodness amen
[1:44:40] a people who he feels welcome with
[1:44:47] don't you want to be that kind of person
[1:44:49] that you just
[1:44:50] welcome him you invite him he he just
[1:44:53] he feels at home with you again he said
[1:44:57] he said to a lady he said you believe
[1:45:00] with all your heart only if your faith
[1:45:01] in jesus can help your sister
[1:45:03] he said reason i regard your sister
[1:45:05] because you're a believer
[1:45:07] and you're a christian if it wasn't your
[1:45:09] spirit would be
[1:45:10] moving back being dark around you but it
[1:45:14] turns light
[1:45:15] you're a believer and your spirit is
[1:45:16] welcomed by the spirit that's anointed
[1:45:19] me
[1:45:20] if you was in a christian if you wasn't
[1:45:22] a believer you would be your spirit
[1:45:24] would be
[1:45:24] moving back i wonder sometimes what is
[1:45:27] happening when people recoil
[1:45:30] and draw back when the word of god is
[1:45:33] preached
[1:45:36] maybe on holiness it may be on things
[1:45:39] you don't like to hear but it's the word
[1:45:40] of god
[1:45:42] and you recall back
[1:45:47] amen if your spirit moving back
[1:45:50] you're but but you are a believer
[1:45:52] because it turns light
[1:45:54] in other words he says he said now god
[1:45:57] knows us both
[1:45:58] sister and he said i hesitated about
[1:46:01] sister for a minute to say that but i
[1:46:04] realize now you are
[1:46:06] it's the first thing you know that
[1:46:08] you're christian because
[1:46:10] as soon as i caught your spirit it come
[1:46:13] in like that you as a christian
[1:46:14] your spirit was welcome if it kept
[1:46:17] turning dark and cloudy
[1:46:19] i know you wasn't and therefore i
[1:46:21] wouldn't have called you my sister
[1:46:25] said like philip said to
[1:46:28] nathanael when he's called up and jesus
[1:46:30] said behold an israelite
[1:46:32] a believer in whom there's no guile how
[1:46:34] do i know you as an
[1:46:35] israelite a true believer that's the
[1:46:37] same spirit the woman could have been a
[1:46:38] rank sinner
[1:46:39] but i know she's a christian because the
[1:46:42] first thing
[1:46:42] her spirit when this anointing that's
[1:46:45] here now
[1:46:46] it caught right quick you see i see it
[1:46:48] was a christian
[1:46:50] and it made it welcome
[1:46:54] you see it didn't doubt and disbelieve
[1:46:58] it made it welcome
[1:47:03] amen now you know we're all prone to
[1:47:06] skepticism
[1:47:08] is that right amen we're prone to
[1:47:11] question we're prone to
[1:47:13] you know to to even doubt
[1:47:16] i hear brother branham's praying often
[1:47:18] god forgive me in my unbelief
[1:47:20] we all struggle with it it's part of our
[1:47:23] human
[1:47:24] makeup it's our unconverted part
[1:47:28] but there's something on the inside of
[1:47:30] us that calls us to believe
[1:47:34] is that right amen even when we don't
[1:47:37] understand even when we say
[1:47:39] well to whom could we go
[1:47:42] we don't have any other place to go
[1:47:44] there's a lot of the skeptics out there
[1:47:46] today
[1:47:46] you know that say that bring all of
[1:47:48] their accusations against the prophet
[1:47:50] and his message
[1:47:51] and they and they got all their reasons
[1:47:53] and their thoughts all lined up
[1:47:55] as to why brother branham is not a true
[1:47:57] prophet
[1:47:58] and you know and sometimes you seem like
[1:48:01] you don't even know what to say to them
[1:48:04] and i don't care if we don't have an
[1:48:06] answer
[1:48:08] we believe anyhow where are we believing
[1:48:12] from
[1:48:13] not from up here we may not understand
[1:48:16] that here we understand it here
[1:48:18] we know only god can do these things
[1:48:21] and beside all of that you know what
[1:48:23] have you got that is better than what i
[1:48:25] got
[1:48:30] where are you going to take me what kind
[1:48:33] of path of sin am i going to go down
[1:48:36] just like i told a bunch of them that
[1:48:37] broke me the other day and i said go
[1:48:39] drink your beers
[1:48:40] and go wear your shorts and laugh your
[1:48:42] way to hell
[1:48:43] but i ain't going your direction
[1:48:49] i know in whom i have believed amen
[1:48:53] i am persuaded amen i'm persuaded that
[1:48:57] he that knows the heart
[1:48:58] he that discerns a heart he that time
[1:49:01] after time was never wrong
[1:49:03] and he was never wrong oh man and it
[1:49:06] comes and it's never wrong you say
[1:49:08] oh brother jim this never happened only
[1:49:11] you know this
[1:49:12] this isn't even scientific i don't care
[1:49:15] if it's the first time
[1:49:16] ever it ever happened
[1:49:23] it's never wrong
[1:49:27] now
[1:49:30] but as i was saying that my
[1:49:33] father-in-law
[1:49:35] jerome butts we called him love it some
[1:49:39] people did that's his middle name his
[1:49:40] mother was a lovett
[1:49:43] and he was named after his mother's
[1:49:45] family so love it
[1:49:48] but he was a young i call him a young
[1:49:51] man
[1:49:52] you know these men they were they have
[1:49:55] sojourned
[1:49:56] among us they were believers just like
[1:49:59] us
[1:50:00] they just ran out of time
[1:50:06] but a meeting there in in mississippi
[1:50:11] where that he where brother branham was
[1:50:13] preaching in mississippi
[1:50:15] and he drove over to the meeting
[1:50:18] and brother branham was saying some
[1:50:20] things and and whatever
[1:50:22] and he said i sat there and he said i
[1:50:26] i kind of was a skeptic and i said
[1:50:29] you know i didn't say it out loud i just
[1:50:31] thought it you know
[1:50:33] that that ain't right that can't be true
[1:50:35] and he said something hit me right in
[1:50:36] the stomach
[1:50:40] he said when it did he said i turned
[1:50:43] from my unbelief right then
[1:50:45] and i embraced it i knew it was right
[1:50:49] because the holy spirit witnessed it
[1:50:52] back to me
[1:50:55] amen now again you know there
[1:50:58] there it is again you know some of us
[1:51:00] come to place is there anything good can
[1:51:02] come out of nazareth
[1:51:04] but then we come back around and say we
[1:51:06] may not put it together
[1:51:08] we may not understand why he's from
[1:51:10] nazareth and not from bethlehem
[1:51:13] we may not have all the facts we cannot
[1:51:16] go back to history
[1:51:17] we can't talk to his mother but we know
[1:51:20] this he's the messiah
[1:51:23] we can't explain everything but we know
[1:51:25] it's the truth
[1:51:27] amen because why we saw him look through
[1:51:30] the pillar of fire
[1:51:37] and there was something in you that
[1:51:38] welcome
[1:51:41] notice now said i see your christian is
[1:51:45] turning real light
[1:51:47] around you that means your spirit is
[1:51:49] welcoming me
[1:51:51] he said can't you see that people me and
[1:51:54] the woman
[1:51:55] the light moving whipping around that
[1:51:57] holy spirit
[1:51:58] you don't see it perhaps yourself but in
[1:52:01] your spirit
[1:52:02] you know it's there
[1:52:07] you don't see it perhaps but in your
[1:52:09] spirit let you know it's there
[1:52:10] now that's the thing that heals you not
[1:52:13] me it's your faith in him
[1:52:15] i want to get just a couple of these he
[1:52:18] says to this
[1:52:19] this another woman i said i i
[1:52:22] he said sister looked this way he said i
[1:52:25] called you sister when i looked around i
[1:52:26] had my back turn you
[1:52:28] but i felt the spirit on you that you're
[1:52:30] christian you're a believer i don't know
[1:52:32] you but i know you're a christian
[1:52:34] because the spirit that's on you
[1:52:38] and the spirit that's on me
[1:52:41] is a relative
[1:52:46] and you just feel like you're welcome
[1:52:48] you know you're just making it feel good
[1:52:50] you're
[1:52:50] welcome the spirit that's on you
[1:52:56] and the spirit of me is a relative
[1:53:03] hallelujah well isn't that right
[1:53:06] every one of you born of the spirit of
[1:53:08] god your sister your brother
[1:53:11] more than that you're a daughter or son
[1:53:13] of god
[1:53:14] amen you're a relative oh my
[1:53:18] oh let me get this one he says he said
[1:53:21] um
[1:53:22] i this lady is a stranger to me
[1:53:25] we are strangers to each other but the
[1:53:27] lord jesus knows us both it's a perfect
[1:53:29] picture
[1:53:30] here's a picture of saint john four a
[1:53:32] colored woman a white man
[1:53:34] that day there was a samaritan and a jew
[1:53:37] two races of people
[1:53:38] jesus let her know quickly there was no
[1:53:42] difference
[1:53:44] we're all god's creatures the country we
[1:53:47] live in
[1:53:47] changing our color has nothing to do
[1:53:49] with it the god wanted his people that
[1:53:51] way
[1:53:51] he made man white black black brown
[1:53:54] yellow red he made them all that way
[1:53:56] that's his business and he loves us
[1:53:58] all what a great thing
[1:54:02] amen but here here's a perfect picture
[1:54:04] two people that's never met before in
[1:54:06] our first time
[1:54:07] two different races and i perceive that
[1:54:09] you are a believer
[1:54:11] you are a christian because your spirit
[1:54:14] is welcome
[1:54:15] and that great angel of god would not
[1:54:17] welcome nothing that was wrong
[1:54:22] certainly not you see that picture there
[1:54:23] that angel on that picture
[1:54:25] that light up above that where i'm
[1:54:27] standing and this is what makes you feel
[1:54:29] the way that you're feeling now just
[1:54:31] coming down over you
[1:54:32] the woman is a christian because from
[1:54:34] her comes a
[1:54:36] feeling of friendship
[1:54:39] her spirit is in that's in her is
[1:54:42] welcoming
[1:54:42] the spirit that is in me your
[1:54:45] welcome spirit is vibrating warmly
[1:54:52] your spirit has begun to witness to me
[1:54:55] you're a christian it feels welcome
[1:54:57] if it wasn't to be pushed away you ever
[1:55:00] notice when
[1:55:01] sinners come and things that see
[1:55:04] uh how it pushes away from them like
[1:55:06] that is it'll just
[1:55:07] right now it'll tell them you're a
[1:55:09] sinner you do such and such or
[1:55:11] you do so and so we're man and you're a
[1:55:14] woman
[1:55:14] and he said with the spirit you're a
[1:55:16] christian i can feel the vibration there
[1:55:19] with your spirit
[1:55:20] you know it's just moving and i know
[1:55:22] you're not a hitchhiker
[1:55:26] and he says you're a christian and he
[1:55:28] said now
[1:55:29] what i mean a hitchhiker is just jump
[1:55:31] from place to place in other words
[1:55:33] someone a hitchhiker is someone
[1:55:36] who for a little rides a little while
[1:55:39] with you
[1:55:40] and gets off before you reach the
[1:55:42] destination
[1:55:44] is that right they're just along for the
[1:55:46] ride
[1:55:48] and it's as soon as you find out what he
[1:55:50] thinks is a flaw in the message
[1:55:53] he gets off
[1:55:57] is that right amen that's a hitchhiker
[1:56:00] people who are not fully christian are
[1:56:02] hitchhikers they just
[1:56:04] along for the ride they're just taking
[1:56:06] up space
[1:56:07] in a church amen they're not going the
[1:56:12] same place
[1:56:15] they're just going along for a few weeks
[1:56:18] a few months sometimes a few years
[1:56:20] sometimes for years
[1:56:21] but at some point they're going to get
[1:56:23] off
[1:56:25] because they never ever really sold out
[1:56:29] their hitchhikers every man you know
[1:56:32] he said but you're born again you're a
[1:56:34] real christian i can feel your welcome
[1:56:37] and the holy spirit here welcomes that
[1:56:39] spirit because it's a kindred spirit
[1:56:41] and we're brother and sister
[1:56:45] i say church why don't we be real
[1:56:48] we got enough hitchhikers
[1:56:53] we got enough hitchhikers along the way
[1:56:57] amen people that are just going along
[1:56:59] for the ride for a little while
[1:57:02] but they're not completely sold out
[1:57:05] i mean they won't give their all they
[1:57:07] won't give everything and god sees it
[1:57:11] he knows your attitude toward the word
[1:57:14] he knows your attitude toward tithing
[1:57:17] he knows that you just think that
[1:57:19] tithing is an old testament scripture
[1:57:22] when jesus placed it in the new and he
[1:57:25] said these things you ought to have done
[1:57:27] and not let the others undone you miss
[1:57:30] it when
[1:57:31] that that you're not paying to a man or
[1:57:33] to a church
[1:57:34] but you're paying tithes to melchizedek
[1:57:37] to eternal priesthood
[1:57:39] and god recognizes it
[1:57:42] you failed to forget what god
[1:57:44] established in his word
[1:57:47] because you're just a hitchhiker you've
[1:57:49] never been sold out to god
[1:57:52] never surrendered your life to him
[1:57:55] so you hold things back like ananias and
[1:57:59] sapphira
[1:58:00] where they held back portions that
[1:58:02] belong to god
[1:58:04] are you with me amen but i want you to
[1:58:07] know
[1:58:07] that god's calling a people today that
[1:58:10] are not hitchhikers
[1:58:12] they're just not along the way for a
[1:58:14] little ride
[1:58:15] they're in for the journey we're going
[1:58:17] in a rapture
[1:58:18] we're going to the marriage supper the
[1:58:20] lamb we will be in the millennium
[1:58:23] we will come back with him come on
[1:58:25] somebody
[1:58:26] and we will ride amen in victory
[1:58:29] all the way everywhere every step of the
[1:58:32] way
[1:58:35] and the bible said and on his head
[1:58:39] were many crowns i spent a long time on
[1:58:41] those eyes
[1:58:43] but i want you just to get it on his
[1:58:46] head
[1:58:47] were many crowns you see abraham's
[1:58:51] victory
[1:58:52] was his victory moses victory
[1:58:57] was his victory am i
[1:59:00] down to the ages that wasn't their
[1:59:03] victory
[1:59:05] therefore that crown really didn't
[1:59:07] belong to them
[1:59:08] it belonged to him and on his head
[1:59:12] was many crowns because he had
[1:59:15] many victories he overcome oh hallelujah
[1:59:19] he overcome an abel's day
[1:59:22] can i preach just for a moment he
[1:59:25] preached
[1:59:26] if i preach on this a minute that he
[1:59:28] overcome
[1:59:29] in abel's day when it was a time of
[1:59:31] darkness
[1:59:32] when sin had entered in and mortality
[1:59:35] now
[1:59:35] had cursed the human race and and
[1:59:38] darkness was
[1:59:39] there holding the people back but i want
[1:59:43] you to remember in that time
[1:59:45] there was a man who got a revelation
[1:59:48] he got a revelation that it was not
[1:59:50] fruits
[1:59:51] but it was blood that took him out of
[1:59:54] the garden
[1:59:55] come on church and he did what he comes
[1:59:58] back and he offers a lamb
[2:00:00] as a substitute a living breathing
[2:00:03] animal
[2:00:04] and he kills him there that there will
[2:00:06] be something die
[2:00:08] in my place and he offers back to god
[2:00:11] blood
[2:00:12] and he cuts a hole through the darkness
[2:00:15] in that hour
[2:00:17] hallelujah as an overcomer in his day i
[2:00:20] want you to know
[2:00:21] god has never had an age where he didn't
[2:00:24] have overcomers
[2:00:26] never never never has he ever had an age
[2:00:29] where he didn't have overcomers
[2:00:31] [Applause]
[2:00:33] and man enables jay he took the sword of
[2:00:35] that word
[2:00:36] i don't know how he did it darkness was
[2:00:39] all around
[2:00:40] myths was so great satan's kingdom was
[2:00:43] established on the earth
[2:00:44] being was gone from them and they didn't
[2:00:47] even know
[2:00:48] they wasn't hearing from god anymore but
[2:00:50] here in this moment
[2:00:52] he believed and by faith he began to
[2:00:55] cut through the darkness and he cut
[2:00:57] through the darkness
[2:00:58] and he cut through the darkness until he
[2:01:01] saw calvary
[2:01:02] he saw the land of a slain before the
[2:01:05] foundation of the world
[2:01:07] and he cut his way through that darkness
[2:01:09] and he come back and he offered a
[2:01:10] sacrifice
[2:01:13] hallelujah why because god is determined
[2:01:16] in every age
[2:01:17] to have an overcomer
[2:01:20] amen brother braddon would preach the
[2:01:22] sermon what is that in thine hand
[2:01:25] amen because what is it you know it's a
[2:01:28] step that's in your hand how are you
[2:01:29] gonna
[2:01:30] whip egypt with a stick well i'll tell
[2:01:32] you god has always done it in every age
[2:01:35] he's always had somebody that would
[2:01:37] overcome in his day
[2:01:39] that would defeat the devil in his time
[2:01:44] come on his people has always been
[2:01:47] conquerors
[2:01:48] because why he has many crowns
[2:01:53] he has many crowds
[2:01:57] i'm talking about this one that's coming
[2:02:03] let me just read the scripture just for
[2:02:05] a minute give me now then
[2:02:07] the next verse because he's here he had
[2:02:09] a name that was written that no man knew
[2:02:10] but he that received
[2:02:12] but he that knew it or received it now
[2:02:15] and he had a vesture
[2:02:16] dipped in blood in his name is called
[2:02:18] the word of god
[2:02:19] next verse give me the and the armies in
[2:02:22] heaven
[2:02:23] which were in heaven followed him upon
[2:02:26] white horses
[2:02:28] clothed in fine linen white and clean
[2:02:32] amen
[2:02:36] i want to depict exactly
[2:02:40] who you are we're talking about
[2:02:44] now where the pillar of fire places you
[2:02:46] the armies
[2:02:48] follow him
[2:02:51] i want you to know there's never been an
[2:02:54] age
[2:02:54] that people overcame by themselves
[2:02:58] it was every one of them by a personal
[2:03:01] revelation remember
[2:03:02] as he says in hebrews 11 by faith by
[2:03:05] faith
[2:03:06] by faith this is why the satanic attack
[2:03:10] is on the personal experience with god
[2:03:13] that every person must have if you get
[2:03:16] you to trade that for just
[2:03:18] a little um social gathering a joining
[2:03:21] of a club
[2:03:22] or belonging to a society of a church or
[2:03:26] saying you believe a confession of faith
[2:03:30] without an action of revelation remember
[2:03:33] because
[2:03:34] only revelation will defeat the devil
[2:03:38] come on church amen the word of god is
[2:03:41] absolutely of no use to anybody unless
[2:03:44] it's held in the hand of faith
[2:03:50] the bible said of them with israel and
[2:03:52] the word
[2:03:54] the word did not profit them because it
[2:03:56] was not mixed with faith in them that
[2:03:58] heard it
[2:04:00] is that right so again he has many
[2:04:03] crowns
[2:04:05] amen my goodness
[2:04:10] here's a man we just take him for a
[2:04:12] moment
[2:04:13] his name is enoch the bible said enoch
[2:04:17] walked with god and was not
[2:04:20] the world has his astronauts the world
[2:04:23] is sending vehicles to mars
[2:04:26] but they're not the first we had a was
[2:04:29] not in space long before there was an
[2:04:31] astronaut
[2:04:33] is that right and then it started with a
[2:04:36] man
[2:04:36] walking with god you say brother tim
[2:04:38] it's impossible for there to be a
[2:04:40] rapture in this last day
[2:04:42] enoch shows us it's not impossible
[2:04:45] when the sons of god were taken
[2:04:47] daughters of men
[2:04:48] enoch was walking with god you say i
[2:04:50] can't overcome this pornography
[2:04:52] i can't overcome the sins of this age
[2:04:55] i'm trying to tell you right now
[2:04:57] it ain't dead but you say but my
[2:05:00] failures brother to my past it's
[2:05:03] weighing me down and i've had my past
[2:05:05] and
[2:05:06] my past has been a sinful past and you
[2:05:08] know over and over
[2:05:10] i fight against this path and i fight
[2:05:12] against this path
[2:05:13] and either live 365 days
[2:05:17] or years it meant 365
[2:05:21] years amen but he only what with god 300
[2:05:26] so enoch had a path and he still took a
[2:05:30] rapture
[2:05:32] he still walked with god and he still
[2:05:35] took territory
[2:05:36] he still took one step at a time he
[2:05:39] didn't stop in his experience
[2:05:41] oh backslidden bus back church member
[2:05:45] here today
[2:05:46] who is vaccine in your in your
[2:05:48] experience

[2:05:57] his name
[2:05:58] is dedicated i am dedicated
[2:06:02] to a rapture i'm dedicated with walking
[2:06:04] with god
[2:06:05] i'm dedicating him taking another step

[2:09:00] forever that means we will shine
[2:09:04] as the stars he says i look back to this

[2:09:33] christ's mystery that christ is revealed
[2:09:36] in every portion of the scripture that
[2:09:39] every event
[2:09:40] every character all the way down to the
[2:09:42] ages has been speaking of this hour
[2:09:45] it's been prophesied of you so noah
[2:09:48] would prophesy of you
[2:09:51] it might build an ark it's going to rain
[2:09:54] but it ain't never rain well the world's
[2:09:56] going to burn with fire but it's never
[2:09:57] burned with fire
[2:09:59] it doesn't matter whether it's never
[2:10:00] been this may be a new thing
[2:10:02] but it's going to happen
[2:10:06] because the word of god can never fail
[2:10:09] in every age it overcomes
[2:10:15] hallelujah and what did noah do
[2:10:18] noah took there and he built an ark
[2:10:22] he built it there there in three

[2:13:50] as an israeli to fight with the
[2:13:52] egyptians moses being sent back to

[2:14:02] rod
[2:14:03] to defeat the devil with

[2:15:01] doesn't matter who it was
[2:15:02] if it's paul he could stand at the end
[2:15:05] and say i fought a good fight

[2:15:11] faith

[2:15:17] when my brothers was against me
[2:15:19] when i was in perils was i was a you
[2:15:22] know we want complaint
[2:15:23] we want to complain
[2:15:27] about what we're going through
[2:15:31] why don't you just look at the apostle
[2:15:33] paul
[2:15:34] beaten with stripes
[2:15:37] three times beat him until
[2:15:42] one more would have taken his life
[2:15:45] stoned let down a wall of the city
[2:15:50] escape in a basket
[2:15:55] in perils and see in perils on the line
[2:15:59] in perils and false brethren the man was
[2:16:03] in trouble
[2:16:03] everywhere he went trouble come
[2:16:05] everywhere he came i want to say it this
[2:16:07] way though the
[2:16:09] the devil was in trouble everywhere paul
[2:16:12] went
[2:16:13] [Applause]
[2:16:15] and that's the way it's got to be with
[2:16:17] you the devil's got to be in trouble
[2:16:19] we've got to make up our minds
[2:16:21] that the devil is the one in trouble i
[2:16:24] am not
[2:16:24] letting nothing separate me amen i'm not
[2:16:27] letting nothing drive me out i'm not
[2:16:30] letting anything
[2:16:31] take me away from the word and obedience
[2:16:33] to the word
[2:16:34] [Applause]
[2:16:38] some of you will go back through things
[2:16:40] in your past where you made an awful
[2:16:42] mistake and you know god
[2:16:44] will bring you right back to that same
[2:16:46] awful mistake
[2:16:48] and let you repeat it so that this time
[2:16:51] you can do it right
[2:16:52] because you're going to overcome you're
[2:16:56] not just going to be passed
