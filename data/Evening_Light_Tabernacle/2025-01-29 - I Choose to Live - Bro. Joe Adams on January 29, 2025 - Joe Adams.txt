you alone are deserving of all the honor Lord all the praise all the worship that we can muster as human beings Lord is not equivalent enough Lord God to just to match your majesty but father tonight we want to give all that we have within us Lord we want to pour out our praise Lord we want to empty ourselves out tonight father that you God can just come back behind our our emptying out and fill us a fresh and a new Lord and may your word come forth in power and demonstration tonight oh God and deal with every heart every life every need every situation Lord we're here just to receive our cups are open Lord we lift them up before you right now father fill us a fresh and a new tonight God Speak Lord to our ears tonight and may the word resonate in our soul father in that realm Lord that we know the enemy has no access so we just commit the service into your hands tonight we give you thanks Lord for all that you do in Jesus name amen God bless you this evening certainly great to be here with you again tonight okay that's when you amen the word simple little like brother Aaron said Sunday Lord class participation kind of goes the long way doesn't it brother Aaron when you're a teacher amen well we're certainly glad to be here we're going to we're going to look here at a thought tonight um come out of Joshua 24:14 and just to kind of set the stage for tonight when I was in Kentucky several weeks ago I was there we drove up Joseph and I drove up on a Saturday and it snowed cats and dogs through the night and nice and the next morning and we couldn't have service on that Sunday but the Lord woke me up at 3:00 early Sunday morning with this thought that he inspired for the service tonight and so things that are going to be said have been spoken long before anything since I've been home so I just want to preface that but I want to speak to you on I choose to live I choose to live and we're going to go here in Joshua 24 and verse1 14 says now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord notice now Joshua's given them a choice if it seem evil for you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord and the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods for the Lord Our God he it is that brought us up and brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage which did those great signs in our sight and preserved Us in all the way wherein he went and all the people through whom we pass and the Lord drave out from before us all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the land therefore we will also serve the Lord for he is our God so now Joshua is making his declaration and the people are making their declaration notice and Joshua warns the people he says notice in Joshua 24:19 and Joshua said unto the people ye cannot serve the Lord for he is a holy God he's a jealous God he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if you forsake the Lord and serve strange Gods then he would turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he has done you good and the people said unto Joshua nay but we will serve the Lord and Joshua said unto the people you are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen you have chosen you the Lord to serve him and they saidwe are witnesses now therefore put away said he the strange Gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the Lord Our God or the Lord God of Israel and the people said unto Joshua the Lord Our God will we serve and his voice will we obey so Joshua made a covenant with the people that day and he set them a statute and an ordinance and sheim and Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law and took a great Stone and set it up under a oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord and Joshua said unto the people behold this Stone shall be a witness unto us for it has heard all the words of the Lord which he spake unto us and it shall be therefore witness unto you lest you deny your God and in verse 28 so Joshua let the people depart every man unto his inheritance God bless you you can have your seats tonight as we look at this I just want to I just want to preface this I'm not sure how long we will go uh with the message tonight the service I do just want to kind of PR if I do go over the allotted time please forgive me just bear with me and just receive from the word tonight but this is what the Lord laid on my heart for the service tonight and I don't believe that God wakes any man up in the middle of the night especially 3:00 in the morning and lays something so heavy on his heart and so the next morning as I couldn't have the service I began to study and prepare and all week I studied this thought out now not knowing that I would speak it here for you tonight but God knows and so we're going to jump back into the background of why Joshua's calling all the Israel together and it says in Joshua 23 and verse1 and it came to pass a long time after the Lord had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about that Joshua wax old and stricken in age so Joshua is realizing he's not going to be around much longer therefore he assum or he ca all of Israel to together and the Bible says in verse two he says Joshua called for all of Israel he called for their Elders for their heads for their judges for their officers and he said unto them I am old and stricken in age and you have seen all that the Lord your God had done at all the nations because of you for the Lord your God is he that has fought for you behold I have divided unto you the land by a lot of these nations that remain to be an inheritance for your tribes from Jordan with all the nations that I have cut off even into the great sea Westward and the Lord your God he shall expel them before you and drive them out of your sight and you shall possess their land as the Lord your God has promised unto you be you therefore very courageous you know I think sometimes we need to be reminded to be courageous in this hour that we're living in but we find Joshua begins to go back he's getting old and maybe he's realizing he's not going to be around much longer and he's summoned the leaders of the church he summoned the leaders in the home he's called all the elders he's called all the officers he's called all the judges this ain't just for the officials at the church but he's called All of Israel and he's telling them he's kind of maybe what he's doing is giving his new year's declaration or his new year's message and making a declaration I'm not going to be with you much longer and he's begin to to to to express himself before the people and he's telling them be courageous keep all that is written in the book of the law of Moses that you turn not aside from their form to the right or to the left and we find in verse seven that you come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods nor cause to swear by them neither the serve them nor bow yourselves unto them so otherwise Joshua is tell telling the people that God is calling you for a total separation from unbelief God is calling you when I place you into that land you got to be separate from their gods you got to be separated from their thinking you got to be separated from their worship you got to be separated from all unbelief notice what he says here when you come un these nations neither make mention of the name of their God gos nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor by yourselves unto them but cleave unto the Lord your God as you have done unto this day for he had driven out from before you great Nations and strong but as for you no man has been able to stand before you unto this day so he's reminded them who they are I think this is a very pivotable point in the is Israel as their existence as a nation because they come through a great prophet like Moses and no doubt many still look to Moses Moses this and Moses that and Mo and yeah thank God Joshua followed in the footsteps of Moses but you recognize the spirit they're not they didn't just keep pointing back to Moses now the spirit was on Joshua and Joshua was anointed to place them in the land Joshua was anointed to take the people and divide the land unto them and he warns them when you come into this land don't bow down to their gods don't take unto their children don't take their son for your daughters or your daughters and give to their sons he said be separated sayeth the Lord and brother Bram tells us here in the message Abraham he said God called Abraham when he was 75 years old and he said separate yourself from your Kindred he say isn't it strange how that today how God called for separation but we call for mixers that's right people when they're choosing their Pastor you that do so he says they want a little slick fella you know that'll take a little social drink and not condemn smoking a few other things here a good guy that'll mix with the crowd now let's just say for instance tonight maybe in 10 15 years we got to elect another Pastor do you want somebody that's going to take a social drink come on do you want somebody that's going to get out there and mix and maybe you know Saturday night he has to go to the bar and get a little fix but Sunday morning he's here you expect him to hear the preach the word right you wouldn't accept that as a pastor so let me just flip the coin for you tonight so if that's what your expectation is for the ministry then why should the ministry not expect the same out of you tonight oh it's wrong when we preach hard and we preach a clothline religion or or we preach hell fire and brimstone but when trying to do is save you from the Wrath and separate you from the things of the world cuz God is calling for a total separation from unbelief see God calls for a total separation from the things of the world come out from among them the Bible says be you separate sayth the Lord and I will receive you see not a mixer a separator the Holy Ghost spake separate me Paul and Barnabas to the work a separation God seg Ates his people that's right from wrong see Abraham was to separate himself and to sojourn in a Strange Land that he knew not of isn't that a beautiful picture today when God by election called you to his beloved then it immediately God speaks to you to separate yourself from the old crowd the pool room the Stitch and sew parties where they tell jokes and carry on a separation see Abraham had it kind of rough brother says and possessing all things things but lot had it easy so there was a difference between Abraham and lot let me just share what brother Braham says about lot's mentality was Lot says you know what I'm a Believer yeah it's okay I'm a Believer I believe God I believe what you know he spoke to my uncle Abraham and I believe he's right that we need to come out and he said and lot went down to Sodom thinking I'm just a believer I believe it'll be okay I can go down there but God called Abraham to separate and God is calling us tonight to separate he said when God called Abraham he called him to separate himself from everything and that's what we have to do God calls us for a total separation from sin come out from among it be not partakers of it shun it the very appearance of evil separation completely annihilated stay your distance away from it don't tread on its grounds no matter how nice it looks so we find young people you know they they get curious when they get to be their teenage years 16 17 18 young boys young girls and you know they think well I go to church on Wednesday and I go to church on Sunday and my daddy's a deacon or my mom's doing this and you know we got a part to play in the church and yet their hearts really not in it and their foot one foot's in the church door and the other foot's in the world let me tell you you can't play that game God is calling for total separation and we find many Believers today have the same mentality and attitude as lot I believe God man yeah didn't you hear what brother Aaron said Sunday that was a masterpiece service I was there I amen I believe God I believe his word I believe the message I believe brother was a prophet and yet they're still waiting in sin some of them are so professed Believers that they're so spiritual brother that they can't even darken the door of the church but yet they profess I believe his word I believe God then what about forsake not the assembly together come on Church don't get quiet on me tonight but we finally oh they they they profess this and you know they got one foot in the church door on Wednesday night they're there on Sunday they there and the Bible says you know with their mouth they profess me but the hearts are so far away God is wanting to get your heart right where your mouth is first John and 2 and verse1 15 the Bible says love not the world you say oh brother Joe here we go again we think we just try to beat the young people up this it's not just a young person message or a young person scripture it says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world then the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever so let's look in the in verse 16 here it says the lust of the flesh now this word lust here means desire y'all awake tonight it means craving it means longing desire for that which is forbidden and a lot of times when we think about lust immediately our minds goes to sexual thoughts or sexual connotation with this but you can lust for money you can lust for position you can lust for power you can lust for vengeance you can lust for beauty you can lust for acceptance but you say oh brother Joe come on I don't love the [Music] world all right well let's look at this in verse 15 there's two words here love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man loved the world let's stop right there that word love there and the second word love there is a gabo love all right so that word there means to welcome it means to entertain it means to be be fond of to love dearly to be well pleased to be contented with with the thing to Delight in it says and if that's the case then the love Agape affection benevolence the love of the father is not in him so when we read it again love not the world or entertain not the world neither the things are in the world if any man is in love or in fond of or is pleased with or is contented with the world then the affections of the father is not in him see God is calling for his children God is calling for his bride to be separated from the world church we can't be yoked up in the world and expecting to go in a rapture we can't be yoked up with the world and the ideas of the world and expect God to pour out blessing upon blessing upon us God is calling for separation brother B says when he calls the people he calls for a total separation from the things of the world Annihilation from worldly things separate yourself and God will bless you yes sir see God's chosen ones are commanded to come out among them be ye separate sayith the Lord I'll receive you touch not the worldly things and I'll be a father to you or a God and you'll be my sons and daughters yoke yourself not up with unbelievers but come out of it God wants separation from the world he wants to be unionized with you himself he's a jealous God if my wife was running around on me I'd be jealous come on brother that's where all the brothers should be saying amen come on I was weak some of y'all may not love your wives as much as I love mine but God don't want his wife to go running around on him out in the world that's right oh he wants her to himself notice notice here he says in Jehovah J total separation from all unbelief all unbelief and remember Abraham the patriarch never absolutely fully blessed until he obeyed exactly what God said to do and we will never never never be blessed any and have the blessings until we obey what God Said now I don't know about you in your house but I want the blessings that all that God has for me to be poured out as brother Aaron said on Sunday I don't want that little Misty Rain I want the gusher I want the cats and dogs I want the pouring rain the blessings of God to fall upon me to fall upon my family on my wife my children I want to fall on our church come on somebody we want the blessings of God but to get those blessings we must obey God fully and God is calling for separation unbelief notice unbelief calling for separation so we'll never you'll never get the Holy Ghost for you that don't have it here tonight until you fully separate yourself Abraham never was blessed just because he left the land of Earth he never was blessed just because he left his Kindred he still had Papa with him he still had lot with him but excuse me but notice when he fully obeyed when he separated himself from Terra his father when he separated himself for life when he started seeking God and God Alone God led him to the place in which God had purposed him to go and in that land god be to pour blessing on top of blessing on top of blessing what am I telling you tonight church if you will obey God and do what God requires and what God asked you to do and you leave all the things of the world behind you leave the the the job that keeps you out of church behind you leave the drinking behind you leave the drugs behind you leave the cigarettes behind you leave that lifestyle behind and you follow God God will begin to pour come on somebody God will pour out blessings and blessings and blessings upon you and your family we should expect the blessings of God now we live in a world let me back up so Abraham Abraham never was blessed until he fully obeyed so God desires obedience now how many of you parents here tonight had kids if you're a parent you had a kid that's just logical thinking you wanted you expected let me just say it like that you expected at least I hope you did your kids to obey you right brother darl I need a louder amen out of you I know better than that you expected obedience from those girls don't you back talk [Music] me man you thought zaro knew how to use a whip you see Daryl baxer with them back talking girls no sir it ain't happening but notice here in 1st Samuel 15 and verse 22 here's a prophet of God talking to a King a prophet talking to a King Samuel said ha the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat Rams for Rebellion is as a sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is Iniquity and idolatry God requires a obedience from The Young from the old and from the old old he requires obedience and we live in a world today that's feels like everybody's entitled everybody's got their hand out they want something for nothing come on you know but brother B tells us in the token message when you fully obey God in a full surrender to it you're entitled to the Token now if you want to come in with that entitlement mentality tonight praise God when you fully obey the word of God then God has entitled you to that token life come on you got your hand out for everything else put your hand out for the Holy Ghost Lord I want it tonight for my family for my children I want the Holy Ghost in our church I want the Holy Ghost in every you tonight God but in full obedience to the word of God entitles you as a family entitles you as a Believer entitles you as a brother and a sister and as a church to the outpouring of the Holy Ghost full obedience he say there's no other way there is he said you could ever be entitled be entitled to the Token until you fully obey the word not what somebody has put in it or added to it but what God said about it yeah and we find in John 53 and: 5 Jesus answered he's speaking to the people he says ver verily I saying to you except a man be born of water and a spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit of spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee ye must be born again see God's first or Jesus's first Doctrine his first Doctrine brother H was ye must be born again cuz without being born again you can't even call Jesus the Christ can't even recognize the anointing so we find here brother bam says in the token he says no you must be born again that don't mean jump up and down at the altar anybody can jump up and down we have witnessed that it don't mean walk back there and shake hands with the pastor that don't mean all of this foolishness that we've seen done it don't mean putting your name on the church book it means Death to Your First being that's the problem Church many of us never died out oh we died just enough to look dead we died just enough to barely have a pul but that little tick of the world look holding on to something but notice to be born Born Again means you die out to your first nature and everything that is entailed in that nature every genetic curse everything passed down everything in the world that tried to grab a hold of you in that first nature you got to die to that thing there and then be born again and that's what God is requiring so his first Doctrine was you must be born again but says notice you people it's absolutely essential and necessary and compelling and compulsory that you received the Holy Ghost for if you don't you can't come in the resurrection that's why we preach the Holy Ghost that's why we preach the depth of the word of God it's not shallow though it's it is shallow God is Simplicity hiding himself in the simple things and yet revealing himself in the same so we find here see he's requiring for says in the token he's requiring that night to separate the Believers from the unbelievers the believer the worshipper was identified with the sacrifice he must apply the blood it wasn't take and kill the lamb and set the blood out there somewhere or to keep it in a charge or take it down to the neighbors he had to apply the blood do you understand he said he the leader in the house am has to apply the it may not look right you may have kids kicking and screaming but you must apply the blood don't compromise don't let off the standards you can do it in your bedroom it's okay not in my house come on dad not in my house not on my watch we're going to apply the token we're going to apply to the threshold of the door we're going to apply to the threshold of every bedroom we're going to apply the blood BL and this place is a place that God the Holy Spirit can come and dwell in we're not going to mix it by just having it on our headphones and playing any kind of worldly music we want to or looking at any vulgar picture show or things out there on YouTube and Tik Tock and whatever else you want to call it no there's got to be the applying of the blood and God is calling for the leaders of this church he's calling for the leaders of the family to take your position and apply the token to your home apply it to your family applied to your marriage come on church he said that's the way it is tonight we could come and sympathize with everything God does that isn't what he requires you got to apply it I better move on some of y'all quiet on me tonight he says Satan doesn't care how religious you are well I got long hair brother Joe never cut it big whip if your heart's wrong if your attitude for having it wrong Satan don't care how religious you are or how right you are in your Doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you've been born again and today we have second third fourth generations of message children don't know anything else but the message they never been out there in another denomination they never been in this that or the other they had but they cut their teeth on the message Pew and yet to them it's a bunch of rules and regulations this is what we do we come to church on Wednesday we go to church on Sunday and if there's a second service on Sunday well you know it goes against the gra but we'll go anyway because that's what Mom and Dad requires and we find we got young people and young married people that with because they've never really had a born again experience all they have was a religious covering when they get to a certain age it never anchored in their heart and they're out there in the world with the religious covering called the message people in our message ranks today are Falling Away young people are falling away because it's a list of rules and dos and don'ts and we don't cut our hair and we don't do this and we don't do that that's the attitude of the unconverted cuz when you get converted it's no longer a list of dos and don'ts it's you obeying the voice of God it's you pleasing the master right this is what my husband desires of me and I want to please him Joshua 24 we get back to our scripture Joshua 24:1 Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to shikim and he called for the Elders of Israel and for the heads and for their judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before God and Joshua said unto the people thus sayith the Lord God of Israel your fathers we on the other side of the flood of old time even Tera the father of Abraham the father of nikor and they served other gods and I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood and I led him throughout all the land of Canaan and I multiply his seed and I gave him Isaac and I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau and I gave unto Esau Mount zier to possess it but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt notice he's beginning to rehearse the history he's beginning to go back and tell them the history of the church little church started 50 years ago there on White Oak Road there with a church that had broken out windows and had a potbelly fire pit and and brother Tim there you know he tells a story like he did the opening of this year begins to rehearse the origination of this church and where we started and where we are today all the great things that God had brought us from and how we went from that little small white church and just a few handful of people till outgrew that and you had to build a bigger Church there in the 90s and then just a few years ago I think seven eight years ago maybe 10 we built this church and you see the progression of the people now Joshua is standing before all of Israel and he's telling them I'm the one I brought you from this place starting with Abraham your father and to his seeds I gave Esau this land but to Isaac I gave him this or I gave him Isaac I gave him Jacob and I gave him Esau and to Jacob they went down into Egypt and I went down in Egypt with them and I sent them a Moses and I sent them an Aaron and I plagued Egypt for your sake and I called you out of Egypt notice he's beginning to rehearse the supernatural not just a story of history but he's telling the supernatural hand of God has been upon him I brought your fathers out of Egypt you came unto the Sea and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and Horsemen unto the Red Sea and when they Cried unto the Lord he put Darkness between you and the Egyptians that's Supernatural and he brought the sea upon them that's Supernatural and he covered them and your eyes have seen what I done in Egypt and you dwelt in the wilderness a long time a long season and I brought you into the land of the amorites which dwelt on the other side of Jordan and they fought with you and I gave them into your hand that you might possess their land and I destroyed them from before you and BAC the son of zipper the king of Moab arose and he wared against Israel and then he sent and called balam the son of be to curse you and I will not hearken unto balum therefore he blessed you oh Church many people tried to curse you come on Church man they have cursed this church they have cursed what we stand for they've cursed what some of you stand for but let me tell you God can't curse what God has blessed and God won't curse you tonight he won't curse you in your family notice he stood between you and Egypt he took between you he split the Red Sea and he he tore down the walls of Jericho he done it for you so that you can inscribe it in history this ain't just the acts of a man but this is the acts of almighty God in a people and all that God requires is your obedience that's right it's a dying to self Joshua's passing off the scene let me go back I went over Jordan and I came to Jericho men of Jericho fought against you the amorites and perizzites Canaanite H the Hittites the girgashites hivites the jebusites and I delivered them into your hands alopecia non Hoskins lymphoma heart trouble come on high blood pressure come on some kind of debilitating eye disease I deliver them into your hands that wasn't the work of some doctor no but the hand of God is upon his people as he was then he is today church he notice that I sent a hornet before you which drave them out from before you even the two kings of the amorites but not with the sword nor with the bow and I've given you a land for which you did not labor cities which you did not build and dwell in them and Vineyards and olives which you did not plant my my my my my how good has God God been to us here Joshua's going off the scene and he begins to remind the people he begins to remind the leaders that God had done all this for us look where we started from look where God brought Abraham from and look where we are today oh my sometimes they do us good to look back over our life our Christian Journey some of us was in drugs and alcohol but look where you are today some of you was out there in sin oh you're one step away from a devil's grave and a sinner's hell but God's rich in Mercy look where you were brother Johnny and look where you are tonight that's almighty god brother L only God can bring a man to a place like this he be to rehearse the history a recognition of the supernatural this is not a myth this is not a Legend but this is God and he begins to reiterate to him all that God has done and he said God requires full obedience look what God has done for us look what God has done for our church look God has done for our families and all that he requires is obedience God brought them into a land that he had already predeter determined he God scouted it out little bitty Israel and he placed his chosen people into the chosen land and God used Joshua a prophet to divide the land by tribe by tribe each to their inheritance and now he's reminding the leaders now you got something to do now God has placed us in our Promised Land Promised Land of the word by the opening of the seals through the anointing of the Holy Ghost now we're placed in that land notice he's remind them it was been God all the time and we find it notice he never put the display of the supernatural he never gave credit to any one man he never gave credit to a kingdom of man built by man God did this God did this God did this God did this God did this God did this and let me tell you if you are ashamed of what God has done if you are afraid to testify of what God has done I don't care what vessel God chooses to use to do the supernatural just so long that God does the supernatural in our midst let one generation declare to the Next Generation the Glorious wonders of almighty God I pray God continues to pour out Supernatural at this church and not just even like Tabernacle but the bride worldwide but let's just be honest we're placed in this land I'm going to skip some things but God has placed us into the land of the opening of the word just like he placed Israel in their promised land and yet brother Joshua brother Joshua tells them I placed you here God has done all this Supernatural but fear the lord serve the Lord notice in Joshua 24:14 therefore fear the lord that's not fear like you're trembling and Afraid and scared but it means to reverence reverence all that God has done if you can't believe just look back over in the corner and see sister Lana and behind her you see sister Sharon and right over here you see sister Ruth people that Satan put a curse on called cancer but yet God rich in Mercy said not not today not in my church not with my people God still breaking the shackles off of the enemy God just declaring that he's alive notice it says to fear the lord behold the fear of the Lord that is wisdom and depart from Evil is understanding Psalms 2 and verse 11 serve the Lord with fear and rejoicing with trembling Proverbs 1:7 fear the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge so reverence him as a sole object of your worship not because you're worried because you're afraid of hell you think you're going to get some fire Insurance W I don't want to get burnt by the fire well you better get right on this side of it reverence him for all that he's done then it says serve him in sincerity and in truth put that scripture up there if you would 24:14 so therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth that word sincerity the Latin word there means it denotes honey without wax unmixed Purity the Greek the Greek is a connotation that means you hold something up to the Rays of the Sun and you don't see a speck or a flaw oh there's coming a day Church God's going to lift his little bride up to the ray of the sun his son and he ain't going to find a spot he ain't going to find the blemish he ain't going to find the flaw why because she's perfect she's unmixed she's pure and she's made of the pure word of God so serve him and we find in 1 Corinthians 5 and verse 7 your glory and is not of good know you not that A little leaven leth a whole lump Purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump as you are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with the old leaven neither with the leaven of malice malignity ill will desire to injure and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth so a little leaven will Lev the whole lump so we got to purge and that's what every service is it's a purging of the old leaven it's a purging of the old thinking come on Church some of us we got to purge every day multiple times a day but so Joshua is telling the people to serve god with sincerity this is not a blind leap of faith but he's going back into history and he's shown them all that God has done for them and Joshua's making a declaration and he's making a call therefore let us keep the Feast of unleavened bread or keep it with unleavened bread of sincerity and in truth and you recall a prophet of God he was had a vision or a dream or whatever it may be and there he was dealing with a black or a mamba snake right and the snake was going after his friend and he he be to I want to deal with this he turned and he looked at my friend and away he went after my friend and I see my friend jumping way in the air and over him and over him and over him trying to think trying to strike at him I thought oh if it ever hits him it'll be instant death and I said if that serpent ever strikes him it'll kill him and just then the serpent and turned to me when I said that and looked at me again and a voice came from above me and said you have been given power to bind him the worst or any and I said oh God what must I do he said there's one thing that you must do you must be more sincere you must be more sinere I said well God forgive me for my un sincerity or my and let me let me have more sincerity and when I raise my hands up up to him again there was a great something come over me just Lifting me up seemed like my whole body was charged with something and I looked at the serpent and he started toward me and he couldn't do it and I said Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind you and the serpent blue smoke flew out of him and he curled up and he made a sign like a capital S and he made it backwards an an sign that means by this one anything below him because he was the worst so notice here if a prophet of God in order to to bind the serpent had to be more sincere what about we as the uh those that are receivers of the prophet's Ministry Church we got to be more sincere we got to be more sincere in our worship we got to be more sincere in our dedication to God don't take it don't take a service for granted thinking well this is what we got to do it's a Wednesday night it rained all day I don't feel like coming grab yourself up by your bootstraps and come to church anyway and worship God that's right if a prophet had to be more sincere we're not going to bind a serpent just by claiming God sent a prophet we're not going to bind a serpent just by believing oh I believe the message of the hour you're going to bind a serpent by more sincerity by worship that's unmixed that's pure and we go to Joshua 24 and ver1 15 as we start closing this thing down I'll land you down here in the next few minutes and if he says no that Joshua speaking to the people if it seem evil to you to serve the Lord choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve whether you're going to serve the Father the gods of your fathers that were on the other side of the river or the gods of the ites in whose land you dwell but it's for me and for my house we were going to serve the Lord You know here it is it comes down to every individual here tonight it ain't based on what church you go to it ain't based on who your pastor is it ain't based on who the your parents are it comes down to every individual Joshua made the Declaration to all of Israel if it seem evil for you to serve this God if it seem evil for you to serve the one that split the Red Sea and walked our family over if it seem EV to serve that then choose you whom you're going to serve notice not if you'll serve whom you're going to serve cuz you're going to serve something that's right you're going to serve unbelief you're going to serve bad habits in the world you're going to serve the strange Gods on the other side of the flood or you will serve almighty God you're going to serve something some of you have been serving sin way too long some of you been serving the bottle way too long some of you have been serving habits way too long but tonight God has calling for a declaration if it seem evil to serve God then choose you a God that you're going to serve because you're going to serve one or the other choose yourselves this day whom you'll serve notice we cannot postpone the decision to another service if it seem evil I like what Peter said where would we go where would we go only you have the way to eternal life are we going to go to the Baptist we're going to go to the Pentecostal we're going to go back out in the world the bar let me tell you the Baptist Church Didn't Do It For Me Brother Johnny I was there to Pentecostal didn't do the fix for me I was there too let's keep on going I was in the Presbyterian church I Episcopal Church oh yeah I did my share of church hopping but where am I at God placed me exactly where he needed me and he placed you exactly where he needed you and now all that God desires of us tonight is a full obedience to him that's right to serve him Matthew 6 and verse 24 says no man can serve two masters for either he'll hate one and love the other or he'll hold to one of despise other you cannot serve God in Manon so Joshua says for me for me and for my house I'm not responsible for another house in this church I'm not responsible for another house that believes the message of the hour but for me for me and for my house in front of all of Israel in front of all the the leaders in front of all the great Pastors in front of all the deacons in front of all the men of God and the women of God Joshua says for me and for my house I'm going to serve God I don't care what it takes I'm going to serve God I'm going to serve him when it's tough I'm going to serve him when I don't feel like it I'm going to serve her when I beat down I'm going to serve God and my family going to serve God for me and my family we're going to serve God that's right I've been I have passed over promotion after promotion after promotion when I was in the workforce but I stayed here to serve God God Honors that I can say it to you proudly I'm B more blessed than I ever deserve brother Johnny more blessings by serving God and staying where God wanted me than chasing the dollar chasing the position chasing the promotion chasing the the power choose you this day who you're going to serve God of power a job a promotion money oh that money a burn you'll lose that job you'll lose that position go down and take a $30 hour pay cut or whatever it may be I don't know but you'll never go wrong by choosing him right he'll never go wrong by choosing this god notice what Josh he gives him a declaration Joshua Joshua made his statement in front of everybody he chose to fight against the amalekites he chose to reject the golden calf he chose to serve the Lord by serving Moses notice he stayed with his Pastor he chose to so Hallelujah he chose to believe God's promise about the promised land he chose to recognize the leadership of the captain of the Lord's army he chose to take the leadership of Israel and lead them into the land see God gives you a choice and Moses stayed with the word and I ask you even like Tabernacle who will you serve tonight for me and my house we're going to serve the Lord that's my New Year's message to you I choose to live I'm gonna go just a few more minutes Joshua's decision notice his decision meant that all hesitation was gone brother Caleb he didn't care who heard him he didn't care what they thought about him we're going to serve God in the Adam's household we're going to serve God it may not look pretty you may ridicule it you may see he's a little bit more more legalistic than he should be that's all right I'm responsible I'm going to serve God and my children are going to serve God and by the grace of God he's giving me my kids by the grace of God because of choice that we make as Leaders notice brother says I can't make your decision friend I can only pray for you you got to make your decision each man chooses not if you'll serve but whom you'll serve see we can we can make this flesh a God and we can serve that we can make money of God and we can chase after it and serve that we can be obsessed with obsessed with the desire for success and that become your God or we can be obsessed with wealth Fame riches and that become a God and we can hold on and be obsessed with hurts past failures Pains of yesterday people that did us wrong and that become a God but you must choose are you going to serve the Gods on the other side of the flood the god of the family the genetics that got passed down the temple the lust the generational things complexes that get passed down from family to family envying and jealousies and things like that the Gods on the other side are the gods that you dealt with in Egypt or even the Gods on the other side of the Jordan of the amorites he's given them a choice you can serve those three or you can serve the Living God Joshua 24 and verse 23 they made a declaration we're going to serve God and Joshua response he says now for put away said he the strange Gods here they are brother Aaron as we start wrapping this up God had placed them in the promised land and has done just the unimaginable Feats great victories great great triumphs I mean destroyed enemy after enemy after enemy and yet they brought with them they brought with them over into the promised land strange Gods things that were passed down from family the gods of their fathers the the the ideas of their fathers the jealousies of their fathers the curses of their fathers and they brought it into the promised land and they were worshiping it and God placed them in the promised land don't let that be your failure don't let that be your struggle tonight let God is place you in the promised land of the word and you're holding on to those things and making them a God and worshiping them God desires our worship they were in the promised land notice no more battles there was a rest from the battles and they were worshiping these other gods the Bible says strange foreign Gods gods of temper passion Pride arrogance bitterness unforgiveness jealousy grudges Envy resentment strange Gods gods that each of you have dealt with each of us had fought with those Gods yes sir can I go through these just for a few minutes let's look at the god of bitterness Hebrews 12 and verse1 15 look in diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled bitterness is Extreme wickedness it's bitterness is anger that is fermented in the heart of those that choose not to forgive bitterness can be triggered by someone who is emotionally stolen something from us and will not allow us to reclaim it we want vengeance this wants Vengeance this wants to remind every day what was done to me I was wronged I was hurt bitterness brother BR says get all these little differences away from your little isms little funny feelings around you from the around you for Brethren right not the guy on the street Brethren little things like that shake it away don't let no root of bitterness ever get into your soul if you do it will caner you and that word canker there is a spreading sword that eats into the Flesh and it just keeps eating and it keeps eating it's like a cancer just keeps spreading and keeps spreading and it's on the inside and you never know but it's spreading and spreading and spreading never let a root of bitterness get inside then there's a god of jealousy and jealousy is a complex emotion involves feelings of insecurity fear and anxiety notice the first murder that was ever wrote down in the Bible was because of jealousy Cain slew his brother Abel at the altar because he was jealous of his sacrifice of his worship and God gave Cain an opportunity if you do as your brother I'll rece deceive you but he was so ate up with jealousy that he murdered him on the same altar with his sacrifice notice jealousy places strain on the heart let me just give you some some doctorial me uh medical advice here on some of these gods that some of us want to hold on to we think oh this is great it's damaging your life right jealousy places strain on the heart palpitations may be felt jealousy stimulates the sympathetic nerve system hormones like a drillin or release to promote flight ORF flight responses jealousy displays and frowns you know how you get when you jealous of somebody yeah like me look it's all over my face when I ain't feeling it I ain't feeling it you know it brother Aaron some of my friends good friends they know they hey they used to come over the house when I was stressed out at work what kind of Joe are we going to get tonight on the face notice studies reveal jealousy places stress on the immune system suppressed immunity from jealousy makes people more susceptible to codes flu wonder why people get sick all the time codes flu other illnesses virus like the epsteam bar that causes fatigue may also be reactive old injuries and pain that can flare up due to weaknesses in defenses all because of something a little God a little foreign strange God of jealousy oh let's keep going now God of grudges Leviticus 19 and verse 18 Thou shalt not avenge let me back up to verse 17 because it's too good to pass up Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart Thou shalt not y'all need to bold that in your Bible Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart thou shal in any wise rebuke thy neighbor and not suffer sin upon him now let's go to the next verse Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people the children of thy people don't hold a grud over your brother the children of the th people yes notice but Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself I am the Lord if you can love your neighbor surely you can love your brother surely you can love your sister surely you can love the children of god notice a grudge is a persistent feeling of ill or resentment notice not a truth but a persistent feeling it's a lie it ens snares you in anger woooo I know ain't none of y'all ever had that sweating all night can't sleep getting even with the brother getting even with the I can't believe she said that about me did you say he just walked right by me snarled up his nose Satan's right there just taking something that's innocent that brother didn't know he walked by you may it made you feel that bad tap him on the shoulder get his attention but we it's notice holding a grudge is when you Harbor anger and bitterness and resentment negative feelings grudges inhibit your ability to cope with and resolve your issue and keeps you stuck in the past now I'm not going to ask for a show of hands but I promise you everybody in this room has had a grudge at one time if you ain't please put your wings up tonight because we're talking to humans men and women in this old carnality of this flesh but our Spirits want to soar in the heavenlies but notice instead of accepting a moving on from the negative experience we find there's no resolution so what do we do when we hold on The Grudge we continually relive that Grudge and we can't wait to tell somebody new about that Grudge we all we all we all had fit that bill I don't care if you're preacher I don't care if you're Deacon I don't care if you've been here and you're 8 to 80 blind crippled and crazy we have all had fit that bill at some point somebody has hurt you at some point somebody has done you wrong somebody said something negative about you and it and it wounded you and maybe for a little bit you held on to that but it's a god from the other side it's a god it's a foreign God a strange god let's keep going just for a few more minutes the gods of Envy Envy is a feeling of discontentedness or resentful longing aroused by someone else's possessions somebody drives up in the church parking lot with a brand new ride how in the world they can afford that thought he was fulltime things get said a lot of things get said in just choose your words wisely because you don't know what that person's dealing with you're envying looking oh I wish I could sing like Sister Laura W man sister Jessica sister Caroline look at her growing up I wish I could play the piano like sister Rebecca the organ like brother brother uh brother Andrew good Lord this what happens when you get close to 50 we Envy we Envy everybody's gift oh I wish I could preach like brother Tim I wish I could you know I wish I could preach Faith Like Timothy and brother Ron and I wish I could teach like brother brother Aaron and we we constantly judging oursel by somebody else the god of Envy now never satisfied with how God Made You never satisfied with the gift that God placed into your life Satan's always there pointing you to somebody else look at them if you would just do this this Envy a god of Envy then there's God of resentment and resentment here is bitter ignation having been treated unfairly and when you're consumed by negative feelings your mind races making it difficult to relax and fall asleep at night chronic sleep deprivation is associated with the multitude of health problems including obesity diabetes cognitive impairment emotional tension can manifest physically in the form of muscle stiffness and pain when you're filled with resentment and bitterness you may unconsciously ttin your muscles particularly in your neck shoulders and back and wonder why people got back problems neck problems shower problems take it back to the root chronic muscle tension can lead to discomfort headaches even chronic pain conditions over time it can severely impact your mobility and overall quality of life and you just think you hurt yourself in the gym and yet little God of resentment you resent what they said you resent how that was handled you resent this and you resent that and you resent resent resent resent another thing possibly one of the most surprising physical dangers of resentment and bitterness is the potential to accelerate the aging process you see people 30 40 years old so bound up and they look 50 and 60 because they're so eight up told you I had a dream and I'm going to end with this I had a dream woken up at 3:00 in the morning and and in this dream this is a dream no names will be given it was a dream don't ask me later who it was dream I had a dream and my daughter Rebecca was in this dream with me and we were sitting down with a pastor and with his wife and we were having dinner and I thought it was just odd that my wife or not my my wife wasn't there but me and Rebecca was sitting down with the pastor and his wife and the pastor could not sit down with us because the pastor was so ate up with bitterness and jealousy and these gods that I just talked to you about and the pastor's wife made a comment did you hear what they said talking to Rebecca and I chimed in I said they're just kids you have to overlook that they don't know what they're talking about you know little kids they hear stuff around the table that they shouldn't then they go and repeat it and it's all twisted and she said well they must have heard it somewhere their parents must have heard it from their parents I said you know what they may have but you have to choose to let it go you have to choose to let it go so I I finished my plate and Rebecca had finished hers and she went on to the car and as I was leaving and walking out the door the pastor stopped me and he said just keep this between us just keep this conversation he overheard the conversation keep it between us and I looked back and I said I understand this more than you realize and as I was walking down he had a staircase that walked down was like Upper Floor walk down to the bottom floor and as I looked I looked back at him and I said I've been hurt as well but I chose to let go I've been wronged by men but I choose not to hold it against them I have felt the pain of Agony and the bitterness wrestled with it but I choose I choose to forgive I felt overlooked and not apart I felt the feelings of resentment this is in a dream but I choose to have joy and I choose to have peace notice everything comes down to a choice I've had men talk about me behind my back and that just happened this past year men talk about me behind my back and I choose not to dwell on it but I choose to press to the mark of the high calling in Jesus Christ I said I understand what you're going through through I understand your hurts I understand your pains I understand your position but I choose to live I choose I'm choosing to live I'm choosing to forego all this I choose not to hold on to bitterness I choose not to hold on to jealousy I choose not to hold on to resentment and Malice I choose no not to hold on to the wrongs of other people have done to me and the hurts I choose to forgive I choose to serve the Lord I choose not to die holding on to these Gods these feelings that seem to give power to me I choose to live and I ask you even like Tabernacle I ask you that's on the stream tonight what do you choose I pondered and I pondered and I pondered why was Rebecca in the dream why was my daughter in the dream and the lord gave me the understanding just this week and he told me he said you your decision I want you to hear me loud and clear your decision will affect the Next Generation your decision your decision your decision your decision will affect the Next Generation your decision then we find here as we bring this to a close musicians if you'd make your way Deuteronomy 30 and verse1 15 I set before you are before thee this day life and good death and evil and that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God to walk in his ways to keep his Commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land whether thou goest to possess it If thy heart turn away so that thou will not hear but shall be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them then I denounce unto you this day that you shall surely perish and that you shall not prolong your days upon the land whether thou passest over Jordan to possess it I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessings and cursings therefore choose life that notice the next part of this that both thou and thy seed may live the decisions you make my brother decisions you make my sister to move on past those Gods to move on past those grudges to move on past those bitterness to move past that and not serve the Gods on the other side of the flood it will impact the Next Generation it
