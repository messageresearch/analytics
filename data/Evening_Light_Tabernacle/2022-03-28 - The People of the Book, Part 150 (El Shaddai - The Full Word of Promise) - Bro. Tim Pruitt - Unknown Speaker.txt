worship him worship him unreservedly all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord on my soul and forget not all his benefits i believe there's benefits that comes by serving him amen it's like it's even much better than any kind of insurance policy it really pays benefits and the benefits are he forgiveth all of thine iniquities and he heals all of thy diseases all inclusive every promise hallelujah it's complete and total redemption it's it's forgiveness for the soul amen and healing for the body that's his benefits it's all lays in the atonement what he paid for us so the next word is and it says who redeemeth because that's who he is redeemeth thy life from destruction and there are those maybe you're lost in sin you don't know jesus but there's a redeemer from the destruction that lays ahead and if you're sick in your body and the devil is sworn he's going to destroy you see because he can't destroy the word so he tries to destroy the vessels the word comes in so he brings sickness upon the body and so but he redeemeth thy life from destruction and then he does more than that he puts a crown on you and that crowns with loving kindness and tender mercies hallelujah it's his finishing touch sets that crown of loving kindness upon you his tender mercy and you don't stop there he just keeps pouring it out he satisfies your mouth with good things so that your your youth is renewed like the eagles you know it doesn't make any difference if your brother and sister hollis that are listening in this morning age has got you down and age-related problems he's still the redeemer the healer the deliverer it doesn't matter if your sister catherine dexter perhaps listening to us right now streaming the service you're not alone sister he's with you and he has benefits from serving the lord those benefits he's there that says let not your heart be troubled believe in god believe also in me amen what is it our faith in our turns toward him and his loving kindness and today we're going to be sending a prayer cloth into her room doctors may want to do their things but god is a great position and he healeth all inclusive all diseases hallelujah might be our brother kenneth and sister loretta listening in today it's for you too doesn't matter how aged or age-related problems and sickness and disease there's benefits it comes by serving him we have our sister ruth wilson of course as you know that the doctors have said she has cancer and says it's in her breast and they're going to do chemo her her daughter sister susanna and brother travis brown they're wonderful people we're happy to have you all today thank you thank you for being here with us in the service and also thank you sister sally and and brother bobby and samuel for coming being here today and the wonderful song we heard exalting the lord but the other day's sister susanna no doubt having burdens on her heart for her mom you know how that feels and she'd been no doubt prayerfully prayerfully seeking god for an answer hearing a tape the other day brother branham's this was spoke to her i see someone that appears by you it's an age person it's a woman very sick i see a long streak coming i see a little girl oh it's your mother and you're praying for in your prayer and your mother is seriously ill and her examination shows she has diabetes [Music] and a cancer and a cancer they couldn't find the other day where it spread anywhere else and you're afraid for your mother and you're praying to god now to help your mother that's true and brother branham goes on speaking there and he and he says and the tears that you wipe your eyes on that anchorage if you lay it on that one that you love and he prayed heavenly father i ask you a blessing grant this woman's request her faith has touched me she brings a handkerchief today for her mother for sister ruth we're going to pray over that now we've seen what god has done we've seen it just sent over to south africa and cancer healed and jobs made and that you know every kind of situations there god has answered prayer and god is answering this prayer not only for this cancer and diabetes but also this heart trouble we're going to pray today and as i as i preach and i minister we're going to minister things that will show up god's strength and power give us courage in this hour let's talk to him right now father it's in the name of jesus that we come and i hold in my hands today these prayer cloths lord god you've already spoke over them even even many many years ago lord things have spoke that has been quickened now to the hearts of sister susana for her mother and she brings this request lord she's a believer she's a lovely person that has put her faith in you and there her mother has been a long time believer or there's been a long streak a dark streak of trouble down through the years even brother brother james has had his difficulties in life lord certainly men's days are few and full of trouble and we read in the scripture even that many are the afflictions of the righteous and certainly lord as long as we live here we have afflictions and troubles but that's not where you ended it you said but the lord hallelujah oh god let's bring you into the equation but the lord delivereth them of them all i pray o god in the name of jesus and as these are laid upon the sick lord that there will be healing and deliverance they'll know that you are with them and present and the prayers of the faith shall save the sick and god shall raise them up it's in jesus name we ask this lord i pray that you bless the service today and us in your presence all of those that have gathered lord there are those that are away from you backslidden those that never knew you have never had an experience with you made today they have an experience in your presence a renewing of the holy ghost and their faith mount up with wings like he's in jesus name amen amen genesis chapter 17 for our scripture reading this morning and we're just looking to the lord to speak to us i'm going to speak on el shaddai again the the full word of promise as we look into this i just pray the lord will direct our thoughts and our words may it go like us to a target there and hit there on every every place where that we need to speak today ministering to the needs of god's people he's able to come by your pew minister to you in a very special way amen he's here to bring deliverance in your life amen he's a prayer answering god genesis chapter 17 verse 1 and when abram was 90 years old and nine so now wait a minute let's stop here just a minute you're never too old for god to do something for you so never give up on a promise no matter you say well i've lived my life well that's all right he still is the healer of all diseases and when abram was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shalt thou name be any more called abram but thy name shall be called shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee and their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and i will give unto thee unto thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger or the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god and god said unto abram abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations this is my covenant which i ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin it shall be a token of the covenant between me and you and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generation he that is born of the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not thy seed he is he that is born in the house and he that is bought with money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant and the under circumcised man-child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he had broken my covenant and god said unto abraham as for sarah thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarai but sarah shall her name be and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nation kings the people shall be of her then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old and shall sarah that is 90 years old bear and abraham said unto god all that ishmael might live before thee and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation but my covenant will establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham god bless you you can be seated now we have been through abraham's journey again there's a hedon like the rest of the world we got a new microphone in it different way to wear it i hope you all are happy that's not better that's worse all right so we have been through abraham's journey with god and he began as a heathen like the rest of the world and was called out by god to walk with him now we've been through it the divine call was justification and every person comes to that place where that by faith they receive god's righteousness and forgiveness for their sins later he brings him to the altar where he was sanctified through the blood offering but now at 99 you would think his journey is complete but god is actually just now going to fulfill his purpose in abraham's life and here god reveals himself as almighty god and in the hebrew this is called el shaddai now as he said in genesis 71 and when abram was 90 and years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and this word almighty god as we said hebrew in the hebrew is el shaddai it comes from the root word and then that root word is the word shad and it comes from the word meaning breast now there was god ex expounding and revealing himself now as the almighty or the strength giver and yet there was already a child that had come from abraham's strength which was ishmael but here god wants one born of the supernatural out of god's strength and and to be born of the supernatural is to be born of the work and and uh so to be born of the word is god will show himself in full strength saying i am the almighty i am god that is more than enough i am god that is in full strength now this is where that we are in this hour we are not in a day where there is a partial revelation of god but this is the hour and the day of the fullness of the revelation of god whether we are not in a time of partial truth but where the fullness of the word is being made manifest now in seed not error with the shock brother branham tells us that this happens at the opening of the seven seals revelation 10 that the full word is to be born into manifestation again vindicated by the spirit of god in the full strength as it was when he was here on earth manifested in the same way doing the same things that it did when he was on when it was on earth amen hebrews 13 8 said jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever luke 17 30 jesus said in the days in the last days as it was in the days of sodom when the son of man will be revealing himself again it will be the same thing so you see again it's a time where the full word has been born into manifestation because we're not in the hour where the book is closed and some of it of truth held in obscurity but we're in a day in the hour where that the word comes fully revealed and fully manifested making him jesus christ the same as he was yesterday and and so there have been many many misconceptions through the ages and part of the word revealed but now you see the things changes you see we had conceptions before that that wasn't right we had misunderstandings that wasn't true but that was before the fullness of the word came to into existence or the opening of the seventh seal so you see we've moved from a time from partial revelation to full revelation and so here was exactly what god was doing with abram he had revealed himself and justification in the divine call he had revealed himself in sanctification in the blood offering but now he's going to reveal himself in his fullness and here now the real plan of god will come into view now of course you know we are in the very hour of christ's return amen amen so again even as there was the appearing of christ our god in the days of abraham and here he comes and reveals himself in a greater way in a greater way and and many different aspects that he will make himself and i want to make something clear to you no matter how many times that god revealed to him himself in different forms and different ways abraham never got confused as to who god was or who god is he never made him a trinity or four or five and so now this is five different ones of him but he saw it was all the same god unveiling himself in a greater way amen so you see it never made a trinitarian out of my heathen out him because you see he had been a heathen but now the revelation comes of the one god and now with many different manifestations of that same god appearing now you know in the past he'd appeared as melchizedek and he had appeared as um as jehovah and he made many different appearance to him but now he comes and he says i am going to reveal myself as the almighty amen as the almighty god as the one who's going to give you strength in your old age oh brother we need that in this day church has been around for a long long time we've come through seven ages but we've got to have a strength giver in this day we'll never make it without him we'll never bring back christ to the earth without the strength giver now so it is the coming of christ that we're talking about in our last day listen in the message the trial and i want to get i want to just preference what i'm going to go into in a moment but in the message the trial in 64 brother branham's quotes again jesus promise as it was in the days of noah as it was in the days of lot it would be in the last day we got it here it's here it's already vindicated just how many scriptures in the sodom age what happened to abraham would return back again to abraham's royal seed which is which is in christ christ returning in the form of his word amen so now i want to give a thought to you for a moment his returning then is going to be much different from the misconceptions of the reformers now before we go anywhere i'm not doing away with the literal physical coming of jesus christ when we go anywhere we are going to have a meeting in the air but i want you to understand that that christ returning is much different from the misconceptions of those before us in the past you see they thought that come the lord was as a moment in a twinkling of an eye now that's the change of the body from mortal to immortal you see that happens in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we shall all be changed when how in a moment in a twinkling of an eye but we found there and brother branham goes over this in the rapture message he said he does three things as he descends so there's not just one aspect of his coming but there are now three aspects of his coming and of course as he does there is a shout there is the voice and there of the of the archangel and then the trump of god and we know rapt the trump of god at the last trump the dead in christ rise so we know the other two then happened before that the resurrection of the saints amen so he descends from heaven with a shout so how could he judge the world and take some in a rapture while leaving others behind yet and there's necessary parts of his word that is still hidden in obscurity still darkened by misconceptions still clouded by unbelief how can he come and just come get a bride come get a people come back like he said and yet much of his word is not revealed are you with me so before his physical corporal comment he has to descend with the open book amen the word has to be restored amen so he said i will pour out my spirit in the last days how many believes were part of that amen and he did and as he did he descends pouring out the spirit he descends from heaven with a shout out amen now you say brother tim i you know how how in the world can we really look at that well go back to the days of of moses and what what did he say to moses in the burning bush i have come down to deliver you is that right amen now the people didn't see so much the burning bush but they saw a prophet anointed by the burning bush with a message of deliverance amen but what was it it was god coming down god descending with a message sent by prophet to bring an exodus where are we in the south god's done some extraordinary things in our age to bring you here to this point to durian in time now this is again again he said i will pour out my spirit and as he does he descends from heaven with a shout now it's a message this shout is not god screaming are you with me it's not just uh a whoop or a yell it's it's saying something it's saying something it's a clear message you know again it's it's not going to be hidden it's a loud it's a loud message it's a shout out amen this was the word returning and that which was sealed up now revealed sealed up now is revealed and opened and this was again not his corporal coming this was the word returning and return it did it returned in his full power i want you to get it in its full power i am almighty god amen this is a time of fullness this is a time of power so it returned in its full power it healed the sick it raised the dead it casts out devils it deserved the hearts hallelujah because it's the word not a theology but the word make it jesus christ to say yesterday today and forever coming in his full power hallelujah healing every kind of sickness bringing making demons to flee ain't been casting out devils amen bring them bring it back again the truth of the word of god but it didn't just come in word only it came with power it came with much assurance [Applause] i don't need me to explain it it didn't need joseph coleman to bring it clarity it didn't need veil as a teacher to help him say it more clearer than he could say it it doesn't need theology theologians and schools of divinity's opinion amen god was his own interpreter and he used the prophet to bring it [Applause] now let's go just for a moment to revelation 10 verse 1 and i'm going to take and just type for a moment this this thought of first thessalonians 4 with this scripture and i saw another mighty angel now brother brandon when he he reads this he said only christ this could be but you see it's not jesus it is the holy spirit coming now and he's the messenger of his own covenant he didn't trust it with an archangel he didn't trust it with anyone he comes himself descending from heaven watch another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow was upon his head showing the seven gold seven colors of his rainbow the complete covenant and his face were as it were the sun no clouds upon it it's here now the word in his fullness and his fetus pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book that was closed now open and he sets his foot up on the up on the sea and his left foot upon the earth and he cried what's his words now he cried with a loud voice again it's not a boohoo you don't have to hand him a kleenex i want you to get the thought he does what he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared the king is speaking we've had seven church ages we've had complete ideas of man over and over and over again remember we have libraries and and uh full of books and every kind of school of divinity in the world but look here now the king is speaking we've had men speaking but now god is speaking and he cries with a loud voice as when a lion roared in other words he gave a loud shout yes now we're right back to first thessalonians 4. he gave allow to shout like the roar of a lion amen when he does he hustles every other voice but it releases the voice of god and when he cries seven thunders uttered their voices in other words when he shouted in that shout the voices of seven thunder spoke yes utter their message in distinct words what had been sealed and closed up in other ages is now revealed now john was going to write it and god said no john this is not to be made known to the end time so i want you to seal this up but when you come to the fullness of times when the ages have run out when you get down to the last age then the mysteries of god will be finished or revealed and made known now this was the same as daniel daniel said i heard it but not with understanding so he says in daniel 12 9 the words are closed up and sealed to the time of the end and many will be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand so he says there's coming and understanding to things that i can't understand now and that's what john was saying an understanding i'm not able to reveal is going to be reserved to the last day and i'm going to finish it up i'm going to finish the mysteries for in revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared all down to the ages to the servants of prophets now this you know is a is a big surprise to a lot of people they look to see and look to see another great for brother branham's crowning of his ministry another great divine healing campaign they look for another times of greater gifts and greater miracles but the third phase of the third pull of brother battle's ministry he would explain it like this as he looked back over it and anointed once in the end time he said notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pull was healing the second pull prophesying the third pull the opening of the word the mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way a prophet can be vindicated is by the word and remember the third po was the third po was the first the third phase of my ministry was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truths that's been sealed in the word now notice people are claiming the opening of the word and yet much is close to them they close the door of mercy sealing up and shutting down divine healing miracles the baptism of the holy ghost the power of god come on actually instead of opening the word many have taken it to close the word now when the book was opened to john he saw his name in the promise and it caused emotions to rise amen it caused him to wring out praises to the lamb who opened the seals the opening of the word actually causes the word to live it opens up a fountain of living water it releases everything in god's promises amen it becomes a bounty support bountiful supply of the holy ghost now what brother branham said in white little bethlehem he said we bypass on creeds and drinking stagnated waters from cisterns what we need today is an opening of the word that lives so we preach their word is open but is it living are you with me now it's got to live if the word is open to you then the fullness of the word lays right there for healing deliver salvation the baptism of the holy ghost every promise in the book the rapture lays in and everything lays in that somebody with me now amen what we need is an opening of the word that lives and he's the same yesterday today and forever he cannot fail some call it telepathy they say whatever they want to or spiritualists or devils as long as that word is flowing free and producing exactly what it said it would it is a fountain in the house of david back in bethlehem where that jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever to his bethlehem dwellers live with it live in it it's life journeying water for us as israel had amen so again you see an opening of the word that lives a lot of what we're calling opening of the word isn't the opening of the word it's the closing of the word it shuts down divine healing it shuts down the holy ghost it shuts down the power of god somebody with me remember when the word is open it lives when it's really open amen it brings out life-giving water if you're sick you can drink from it if you lost it'll find you ain't now whatever the need is it was there because it's a life-giving water [Applause] a bountiful supply more than enough not just enough more than enough now the message of malachi 4 brings the birth of the word now for it turns the heart see you got to see it's a new birth because it turns the heart and and it bursts a people who can believe oh the word that it returned back to the original faith now out of the word the original faith the message comes a people born of the word who are the word made flesh in his fullness now i'm taking you now just for a moment let's just make the transfer we are moving now from revelation being given to a word becoming flesh because this bible this word this open book this message you receive is no good unless it becomes flesh it's got to live now in birth pains brother branham would tell us some messages to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth to be she has to be delivered of a new birth according to malachi ford so from malachi 4 comes a birth and it's a birth of a word but out of that word comes a people as he says in birth pains the word must deliver the word bride church the church has got to be delivered out of her a bride for christ so the word must deliver or birth a word bride church we cannot be a people that just say well hallelujah we got the message and we got our collection of books and we got our tapes and we got all of this and that's it no it's got to birth a word born church he said she's fixing to bring forth the perfect word back there now again he's making it clear it won't be a parcel where the word in its perfection and the word is coming forth the word bride as a woman is a part of the man taken from him so that will the church be a word abiding church every word of the bible not system dogmas nothing added to it it'll have to be an unadulterated pure virgin word now isn't that something as a shout-finish sound in his message the voice of the resurrection begins all right let me say that again as the shout finishes this message and out of that mysteries are revealed silence is broken on scriptures that have been held in silence for years and years are you with me you see we're we're not living in the days of the silence we're living in the days of the voice word that the silence now become what was silenced and shut up now becomes the voice now and as it as the shout finishes sound his message the voice of the resurrection begins but where does it begin it begins by resurrecting a people out of dark cold denominationalism out of the tombs of the religion of people who can say i was dead come on i was dead i was in the tombs of religion i was dead i was dead in sins and trespasses i was dead in unbelief i was dead and false doctrine but not no more behold i am alive forevermore and i have the keys that will unlock every dollar of health [Applause] the gates of hell cannot prevail against us now this is this is so incredible the word actually bursts a bride and this this is this is the same it's just more of the descending of the mighty angel it's just more of the rapture that is going on amen first it comes as the word a message coming to a prophet and then is transfers and goes into the next face where it comes a voice in the people now as the book transfers from the hand of the angel it transfers to the hand of john remember in revelation 10 80 said don't take the little book out of the hand of the angel so therefore there comes a time where the book becomes your promise hallelujah the book becomes your inheritance i'm talking about the book that john wasn't worthy to look at but once it's taken by the lamb and the lamb has done his intercessory work he didn't keep it for himself but he comes down with the open book to make a transfer to all the seed of abraham [Applause] the royal seed now it's christ returning but not as a shout it's not in a prophet people are saying we got the word the word the word we got the word and i'm going to say we do have the word but christ has now returned in the church listen to me as the same bride she was in the book of acts at pentecost so the word before there can be a bride taken the word's got to produce one that's right that's right come on and now out of the word has got to come a people and they've got to be that word made flesh or made manifest now as he said in the identification of christ is god manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and her husband is the self same flesh these two are one and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word so that the word in the church becomes the same the word in the church making it the bride the last sign god identified himself the to the word in the church now now again the church becoming the bride by believing the word so that the word and the church becomes the same amen now so as a wheat plant has to go from grain back to head of grain so must the word bride head up into the person of the word of god so this last day people will be the fullness of the word not a partial word express the whole word expressed hang tight with me i'm just laying some background here other ages of that reformation but this is not a reformation this is a restoration a matter of restoration what of the original seed that was planted so you see down to the the you know the corn of wheat that but died at nicaea rotted in the dark ages is now shot shot up a shoot of truth in luther it grew on there but at the end of the laodicean age where we're at just before jesus came the church goes back to being the wheat seed bride again amen hallelujah now again he says in god of this evil age word bride heading up in the person of the word of god made manifest in this evil age that we're living in so the bride will be the person of the word made manifest manifesting all the work every promise every gift all his righteousness all of his holiness amen everything there will be living epistles in other words the living word we're not talking about now listen i i just want to say it whatever's in your library can't live but what's in your heart can live amen and it makes the people born of the word and they have power amen a living word a living bride a word that vibrates with power a pride that pulsates with life amen see he would say he said and we would see jesus see your written epistle of god a real true born again christian is the word expressed again because you're written epistles read of all men what what type of a person should we be if we know that our lives is an open living bible to the unbeliever you can't you see that the bride becomes an open living bible so we're talking about now the open book we're not just talking about a sermon brother brad and preach we're talking about a people that it produced amen a people who is the open living book they are the fulfillment of all the prophecies can't you see them that the bride becomes the open living book how did this do it revelation 10 8 says they do it by eating the book amen and they by eating the book or to express them the fullness of god once again because what happens by eating the word makes you prophesy in other words the word has got to come out of that people it's got to express itself it's got to express healing it's got to express miracles it's got to express the holy ghost it's got to express the the power of god it's more than a doctor and it's a life it's a power are you with me church live an epistle epistles that are living we got epistles written in the bible but you are to be the living epistle amen epistles that's living that's been written and now living out the word of god oh my we receive many epistles from the prophet of god we got tape loads up of pencils of truth amen but that's got to become a living epistle a living word a living power and a living people and a living pride people that are living out the word they are the manifestation of the promise now the true born-again church in this hour is the living word of god it is the word of god in his age made manifest search the scriptures and see what's supposed to be happening in this age brother branham says there is christ living again just changing his mass from one to the other amen what's now changing his mask from one to another he was once in luther but he changed his mask and revealed himself in leslie and then he changed his mask and he was in the azusa pentecostal meeting and then he changed his mask and came into the healing revival but then he changed his mask to come into a word revival and now he's changed his mask again and is in bright form and she is the interpretation of the words yes sir see the discrepancies that jesus was the the interpretation of the word he said stretch the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life they're not justified to you they're testifying to me he was the interpretation of the word and every born again son and daughter of god of this age is the interpretation of the word hallelujah you want to know what divine healing is that's interpretational word remember when we saw the atlanta healed of cancer when we seen drew walk when we see blind eyes come back open with sister karen when we see god move time on time and time again what was it that is what god thinks about divine healing i'm still the same i'm still the healer i'm still the deliverer hallelujah amen you want to see you want to know what his interpretation is of the holy ghost i'll tell you look at our young people look at one's like aaron that was insane that god transformed their lives hey man look at you look at me we are the interpretation the interpretation of that word a written epistle written in our lives read of all men now 2 000 years ago at the culmination at the climax at the crowning moment of the old covenant the old testament the word was made manifest in a body in the man christ jesus the fullness of the godhead every expression of god was in him the fullness we know that it wasn't the second person it was the person come on now we've got a one god bible all the way down through the bible he's a one god that's a way you know brother branham didn't bring a trinity of gods he didn't bring a senior god in a junior god a man or a senior god and and the man is he just a man you know he's just a another human like us no he showed one god god above us god with us god in us is that right amen and the fullness of god was made known god and man become one the anointed man christ what does christ mean the anointed one the anointed that was anointed with the fullness of the godhead bodily amen oh how could we doubt that how could we question it after hearing and i haven't revealed how could we get somebody confusing us with two jehovah's two jesus's truth isn't true that come on now amen god made it clear to us amen that the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in christ where once moses partly had him and partly david had him and where but now he was manifested on earth deity himself standing on the earth god in his fullness to die for the sin of the people that he might bring this church a sanctified life that he might have the preeminence and fullness in his church that he in his in his church to manifest every promise somebody say every promise in this last day before he promised that for the last day so here we are again christ did all of that to sanctify a people amen so that he might have the preeminence in them and what's getting in fullness in them amen manifests every promise for the last day every promise every promise every promise now at the end of the ages at the culmination at the climax at the crowning moment somebody with me amen in the crowded moment now of the new testament we've had seven church ages we come now to the end of the new covenant we're here at the end with the the dispensation of the fullness of time you know all the word is made manifest in a body in the bride of jesus christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and every expression of god is in a people just like the culmination of the old testament brought the fullness in a body come on now god by his word has created another body called his bride it's the same god he just changed in his mouth and man it's now god in you christ in you that's the hope of glory are you with me church and now he comes to bring that same fullness into a people i'm driving it home now you see as brother branham said first he had to reveal himself in christ the fullness of the godhead bodily if you doubt that you ain't even got the first base yet if you questioned that you hadn't even you're not even you're not even playing yet amen you brother branham said you cannot get to first base without first believing in the supreme deity of the lord jesus christ first he had to reveal himself in christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminency oversight deleting amen god expressed himself in jesus christ who was both father son and holy ghost the fullness of the goddest bodily now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church preeminence all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was was poured into the church the believers and in there there would come forth it be a time when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church have preeminence in his church oh my what the anointed man are you ready for this now now the anointed people to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom so she's got to be the christ the messiah the anointed one just like he was amen and this is where every denomination passes off the scene this is where the shock is separated from the weak this is where the child of the bonds woman is rejected after coming of el shaddai by the announcing of the coming of a supernatural son of the promise i'm going to bring the seed of abraham and they're going to come supernaturally they will not come by denominational bondsman now this is where it changes from the days of the voice of the seventh angel and that phase is now over i i know that's shocking for somebody to hear that but that phase is complete he sounded his message he no longer preaching in shreveport and then in new mexico and bringing a new revelation here there it has been revealed the message has been finished there's no not in need to bring a another trail of the serpent and another idea or another this or another that or to finish it it's finished it's finished amen the mysteries are over they're not mysteries anymore the thunders are revealed they're no longer a noise they're no longer just something that was said we don't understand we understand it now how do we know it by the because god descended from heaven with a shout and spoke a message through a prophet to do what to give us the full counsel of god every mystery of god needed for the bride has been delivered [Applause] i don't need to bring your new revelation i don't need to bring you a new teacher i don't need to bring you something that'll perfect you for the rapture it's already there it's already there what you need to do is take it for yourself and digest it and let it come out of your mouth and you speak the same thing the word said [Applause] revelation 10 8 because too many people have stopped at revelation 10 7 and the same angel continues and the voice which i heard from heaven speaking to me again saying go and take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and john went and took it and closed it sister janie looked up there to see if that said that it don't but that's what people do they have claimed to take it and then they close off the power of god healing deliverance salvation miracles dear god we need miracles sister ruth you need a miracle brother james you need america elizabeth you need a miracle there are but there are miracles that are happening hallelujah amen there are miracles that are taking place and we see it in our young people we see it in our middle age we see it all over it doesn't matter age has no doesn't hold it has no bars are you with me the same word would go right down to bill dowell an old man past 90 and give him more years i'll tell you god is here to give you more years to make you live to the rapture it's the power that lays in the word it's there it's there to be it's to be tapped into is it's a thousand of water it's a is an unlimited fountain come on somebody help me preach it amen what have you got to do take that book and eat it and then prophesy let it come and live out of your life hallelujah let it manifest every promise why why eat it why eat the book verse 9 he said the angel said give he said to him give me the little book and he said take it and eat it up why eat it the word and the message must become flesh it's got to move from book form to flesh form and when eating and digesting then it must become a voice of god and i wanted to say and declare that voice is now in a bride amen revelation 10 11 and he said thou must prophesy again it's already been prophesied we saw it manifested in brother branham we saw what the word would do it healed the sick it raised the dead it cast out devils and when it filled with the holy ghost come on it brought truth and revelation and enlightenment it throwed light upon the word that had been once darkened from our view come on somebody else help me right now am i but now you must prophesy now it's your time to speak now it's your hour for the bride now to be manifested [Music] and it must produce a supernatural people so you wind up with abraham one of his flesh and one of the supernatural this is not complete until it's made flesh and it's not complete until it's all made manifest until the dead and christ are made flesh again and their theophanies are glorified amen you're thinking you know we got to be glorified so do they amen but i'm going to tell you friends that's exactly why you have become a voice amen that's exactly right brother adam told us and what is the holy ghost he said at that day you will know i'm in the father and you and me and i and you see as god poured himself in the church at that day the whole thing is one plan of redemption coming down god coming back to live in and dwell in and commune to his people as he did beginning and as soon as he gets his church in speaking condition gets love and persuade and fellowship uh his church to a place that he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship then there will come an eden and he'll take his church back where it left him back to an eden again there where it fell that's where the first start of the fall and that's where it'll be taken right back with every clean slate of redemption bringing them straight back to that place again hallelujah again he says now this day we're living this age is beyond pentecost he's speaking of azusa street but now it's all coming forth it's all a coming forth of the holy spirit till the great church is being filled up and trump full hallelujah of the great powers of the almighty god until it's got to place unto the very works that jesus done has manifested itself right back in the church right now again he says and what is the holy ghost given for but we needed the spirit of god ray when we needed the spirit of god raises a standard and we need a standard raise when we see prophecy being fulfilled when we're watching russia like he told us to amen when we see you know our president i wasn't yesterday by the way he made a speech i listened to it yesterday so maybe it was the day before but he just he just released a a message to the world and he starts out talking about john pope john paul he starts talking about the first polish pope and he starts right there beginning right there with catholicism and the power of catholicism and how it brought down the mighty soviet union starts right there we're here where where right now we're already seeing economies now bowing down no you know men that can't buy or sell without permission of the beast [Music] we're seeing steps that are being made we see the the the other the uh the the car that he saw in the vision we see that now on the streets and when we see it running the driver's list system running the taxis in l.a in san francisco we see prophecy we see the woman dressed in purple being elected as a vice president we see another woman there that it was the same because he said i couldn't tell which one it was whether it was a woman raising in power being a great vice president or president or something or whether it was the catholic church i i couldn't tell which one it was and it winds up being both we got another catholic president he described even how she would be dressed in royal purple we're right here where the vision we're right here in division come on daddy biscuit look for your green checkered church are you with me you're you're to be wearing it you're to be dressed a certain way you're being prepared by messaging this day hey my you've got to be a part of that vision you're a part of the world that's being fulfilled and it's more than a grizzly bear and it's more it's a bride without spider wrinkle it's the trophy it's the trophy [Applause] said those that are under the altar out of the scripture said how long lord how long how much longer god's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time where god can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church and christ come so close together till christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead and we go in the rapture these are exciting times amen these are exciting times he said there there's been a little breath of it and luther a little blow every wesley a deeper blow with the pentecost now the breath and the spirit has become the same and she's uniting together bringing forth that same powerful blow of the holy ghost like he did back there is manifesting the same works he did back there is manifested again the same thing he said what is the holy ghost now el shaddai is the almighty god he is actually this is actually the baptism of the holy ghost that's exactly the place that we're in where god is pouring out in the people his fullness the fullness of his spirit and with the fullness of his spirit comes the fullness of his power they've had portions of it depths of the spirit and the ages past a dip in at luther a greater dip with wesley a greater depth with azusa street but this is where he pours out his fullness this is where el shaddai is known in his power in his fullness what's what he says he said to bring a church to a place in this day far beyond luther methodist pentecost into a place of adoption and rapture and grace that when this church when the spirit moves into this church here it'll just raise and it'll bring forth all that is redeemed that's touched by that spirit the lutherans who stood in the light they had in justification those methodists that fell on the floor and they throwed water in their face from the spirit striking them through sanctification those pentecostals that they walked up and down the streets and they called them tongues demon and jabbers and goose language and all that they'll stand in the righteousness in the sight of god in that day just as certain as the bible stands here but if you believe me to be his a servant you call me as prophet i don't call myself that but you listen i'm telling you in the name of the lord that those that are in christ will god bring with him at his coming at the resurrection and only those that are in christ are you with me now amen so part of his coming listen he is coming he is here this is his coming you are his coming hallelujah the rapture is more than just an event it's you you are the rapture i'm afraid i'll miss the rapture i can't disrupt her i am the rapture hallelujah for the more i am the resurrection that's what jesus came to he said i am the resurrection i am the life and there is a people on earth today who are the resurrection they are the life they are the rapture that's who they are they have been quickened they have the dynamics say to this mountain you heard what's been taking place that's a ministry we're entering into prophesy again we're way up the road now soon to come to the lord jesus we've got to have rapture in faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye to go out or we'll not go but don't worry it'll be there hallelujah that shouting grounds right there amen we look over there we've wondered whoa when's this going to be when will russia rise it'll be there and then when will this happen when will there be this woman in purple she's there and man it'll be there she's there let me hear this one and this and this and this and this part of the vision and here you are and what about it he said we got to have rapture in faith in the church that can be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye to go out or we'll not go but don't worry don't worry about it it'll be there amen it'll be there and when the power of this church rises you ought to be looking for the power to rise within you i'm trying to preach to you today amen that you are not a part of the word you are fullness of the word it's no more portion it's god pouring out his completion that mysteries are revealed hallelujah but it was more than seven thunders under their voices it was god identifying a people in this day who are the recipients of that voice and have become that voice amen and when the power of this church rises when the power of this church rises how many wants to see the power of that church rising i'm already seeing it rise hallelujah amen things that i've preached about and held on since i was a boy preacher and held forth these truths i'm not seeing it catch fire amen in the wind of the holy spirit catching it amen it's causing a mighty move of the holy ghost what's happening and when the power of this church rises it'll bring its brethren it'll bring its brethren into praying the dead in christ reminds the power of this church that church rises it'll bring its brethren and the power that church will bring other brethren and will be a general resurrection all the way the last to go down will be the first to come up hallelujah say what you want to call me a fanatic if you want to but i heard my wife call my name the other night this is twice just happened amen what is it we're coming close we're coming close you say bye to jim you can't hear voices from the other side brother adam did he said they were saying press the battle don't give up i tell you if we can hear him cry out right now we would hear him say don't give up the fight don't give up your faith don't stop now hallelujah at home time that power that is rising and you will power hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen we're not leaving a hoof behind not a hoof behind amen we got ethan here ethan raise your hand ethan wanting to be baptized today in the name of the lord jesus christ we've got toby back there come to the altar the other day look at that hand up look at that smile on my face look at the change they got no longer tuning us out no longer sleeves we're going to sleep i mean something's happened to the boy what is it it's resurrection power it is god saying i'm not leaving a hug behind hallelujah i'm calling my elect i'm calling my people i'm calling him now this is of course where ishmael the child of abraham's or abram's strength and sarah's weakness is set aside rejected as the seed of the promise you know he's the seed he become a great nation but he's not of the covenant the child of the covenant must be supernatural the the children of the covenant in this day must be a supernatural people was abraham's or abram's fleshly strength while isaac could have only come through the supernatural now men with their own strength they can start denominations there's over 40 000 of them today 20 000 of them pentecostals charismatic but it takes a supernatural to birth a bride for christ and only el shaddai can do that only only a true baptism of the holy ghost will produce a bride because sarah was 90 and abraham was 99 god would have to restore their bodies and heal sarah of her barrenness amen he would portray in their lives he would actually use them to prophesy of all the seed of abraham that would come remember why does he go up on the top of the mount how come that he goes and is offered as a sacrifice and god provides the lamb because it is a prophecy of the seed coming so what we are reading in the bible here is a portrayal it is a prophecy that and god used in their lives as a prophecy what he would do at the end age amen for he will change the bodies of the living church and resurrect the dead in christ in order to bring of the to about the long-awaited promised son jesus christ now god promised that the grain of wheat that he planted at pentecost in the book of acts would return back to the grain again and these other stages of the wheat plant like the blade the tonsil the shack they were not the promised restoration no more than ishmael was not the promised son and neither was azusa street the restoration to pentecost they are called pentecost like ishmael was called abraham's seed but he was he was not the prophecy they are called the pentecost but they're not the promised pentecost is somebody with me amen but let me tell you this is the restoration god will take his church right back to the pentecost of the beginning hallelujah we remember you know it's the vine putting forth her branch and again there's been all kinds granted on and through i uh sarah's idea ishmael is is grafted through a bonds woman into the family but she's not part of he's not a part of the promise of god somebody with me we've got baptist methodist lutheran everything else you know that's been grafted into it every kind of denominational fruit but if she ever puts forth another branch are you with me now listen they have tried to reform the tree by trying to put in this luther or wesley or that it's all reformation but if the vine from the root ever puts forth another branch amen she'll be a genuine christ centered amen christ feel the word of god i'm quoting your prophet there she'll be a genuine christ feel christ-centered word of god if it ever puts forth another breath she'll be the word like he was the word amen as he said i will restore saint the lord i'll send back another church in the last day i'll restore the original power again in the evening time it shall be light down in the heart of the tree no matter how many branches is pruned there will come forth the royal seed of abraham hallelujah god promised city i god will do it i will restore remember that now he said it's for ishmael i bless him there's 40 000 of them they are a great nation there'll be some of them that will there and and and i'm not even saying you know any of the of the great horse system but there be sincere people among them that will be there out to the in the tribulation and they have would have washed their robes in the blood of the lamb and they'll be led to living

the lord the lord has sent sister sherry to us and she has come you know to come here for a fresh start with god she is doing some of her first works over again i met sister sherry when she was just a very young mother over in texas i preached over there and some in some churches where uh actually there were black churches where i uh what she was witnessed to by the brothers over there and the lord is has done some great works in her life in the long life's journey you know sometimes we make some missteps along the way and we don't maybe haven't ever went as far along with god as we should but seed of abraham sometimes can go down to egypt but god won't leave them there every seed of god he'll get back in the promised land is only back in the promised land where god will bless you and i believe that god is meeting sister sherry in this water today she has come as jesus did obedient to the word of god jesus came obeying the word brought his body his flesh down to the river jordan to be baptized submit himself to be filled with the spirit of god today she comes back into the promised land back where the blessings flow back where she can meet with el shaddai back with it that god can put his life into her so sister sherry as i have prayed with you there already and you have come to be baptized in the name of jesus christ and obey his word the lord jesus sent me to preach the gospel into all the world and he commissioned me to baptize those that believed and received him to baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost and so in the obedience to that divine promise of god i baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ praise the lord thank you lord hallelujah amen thank you lord just take a moment and thank you thank you lord thank you jesus bless the lord o my soul and all that's within me bless his holy name he redeemeth thy life from destruction and renews you like he renews the eagles hallelujah thank you lord for your promises amen amen god bless you amen for being obedient to the word amen god bless you praise the lord isn't god good to give us so many blessings give me romans chapter six i want to read from verse 1 there this this morning as we just think of the word of god and his promises the bible said what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid so for how so we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death therefore we we are buried with him by baptism into death that like his christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in the newness of life but if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection so what we are here doing today is we are absolutely typing out the death the burial the resurrection of the lord jesus and as i've explained to these young men and this is ethan adams coming here that wants to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus you know it's not it's not about our young people coming to maturity or to puberty and they you know so now they're going to do the adult things this is not about doing adult things this is about doing the right things following the lord in water baptism and the water baptism there that we have been instructed in is at first the first steps of salvation is repentance and that's turning from sin and then and of course there has to be a death to the old man and that's the problem is we bury too many lied people we are only to bury the dead and so we can bury those and they will go down in the water you know as a live person come back alive but if you are ever dead to your sins you will come up in the newness of life and be filled with the holy ghost this is a promise is to us to our children to them that are far off as many as the lord our god shall call now ethan the lord jesus sent me to preach the gospel he commissioned me to do it and i come as his forerunner today in the sense that i'm the baptizer but there's one coming after me that will do what i cannot do he will baptize you with the holy ghost and fire so today you being dead to sin and you repented of your sin that's correct and you've asked the lord to be the lord of your life correct now then on the confession of your faith where he sent me into the world and he gave me a commission the great commission go into all the world and preach the gospel baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost in obedience to that divine command i baptize you brother ethan in the name of the lord jesus christ thank you lord praise the lord comes one of our young men that i prayed for many times toby when he came down the altar the other day on wednesday night i punched timothy i said toby's coming it excited me it made my heart rejoice you know i've seen a young man that has been just dead just dead just dead to god dead to the things of the lord i saw the transforming power of god deal with his heart and after the service of singing to the glory of god and his heart reaching out to god i tell you god's a miracle working god we go through a lot of difficult things but let me tell you toby he'll be your father he'll be your friend that'll stick closer than a brother you will never just be wanting a friend anymore jesus would be your friend but i want you to look out over this congregation right here you got friends all over this church right here you got brothers and sisters in christ you got you got men and women that love you that'll support you in your walk with god that wants to be a a a friend to you to encourage you a long life's journey you're not by yourself in this you got me brother tim you got brother aaron brother joe brother timothy you got all the ministry here at evening light tabernacle to support you to encourage you in this walk that you're making with the lord you're not by yourself you're never alone so today you've made a great decision you've asked the lord in your heart you asked him to be the lord of your life you know what happened by you asking him to come in he won't live with somebody else there he won't live and there'd be two kings in your life he won't do that he'll either be lord or he won't be there he cannot abide together with with the devil but we were born you see with sin nature in her life i was born that way too i needed a savior just like you needed a savior he's all born in sin shaping iniquity brought the world speaking lies but you know what god became our savior to save us from a life of sin and to change our lives and make our nature new and that's what he's there to do for you today today give me your hand right there toby i should put your hand over your nose right there you put this hand up here you know toby the lord jesus sent me into the world to preach the gospel he ordained me from a little boy and he commissioned us in the great commission to go in the world preach the gospel baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and the holy ghost in obedience to his word i am
