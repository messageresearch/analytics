moment how many feels that way today lord i need you i'm nothing without you jesus would say it often i can do nothing except my father shows me first we are sons of god and mirroring that sonship this morning we realize our need of jesus amen we want him to speak speak through the word today let's talk to him lord jesus here we're your children we have come to gather in your name we know you're here among us because your word promised you'd be here even if our sins our senses did not declare it our faith says the word is true and we claim the word of promise today for deliverance in the mighty name of jesus and it matters not how great the storm we rejoice in the storm because we know that it's in the storm that jesus who is in our boat steps forth on the brow and it's he that then takes control of situations and changes them may the jesus inside of us that's in our boat today rise to the challenges of this moment we'll not drown and will not perish but oh god we will have complete and total victory we know lord that right here on the other side is deliverance lord as the disciples that day father immediately found himself at the land there was a legion who demons were cast out and thrown into the pigs and the pigs drowned it's a day lord of the casting down of satan it's the day of the horizons of the sons of god it's more than just a season that we've turned to lord because we we're in a moment of time where that you're doing the miraculous you're fulfilling your word that you promised and it's not like a season that the end is a season that a time that will rapture us will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we're looking to the word of promise heal your children today save the lost lord edify the believer build them up in the most holy faith may we realize lord we're here for such a time as this because we have been anointed to tear satan's kingdom down lord we are here when we come and report for duty today as the holy spirit will do the work jesus name for the glory of god we take dominion over every demon power every spirit of the enemy every cancer every disease every evidence heart disease brain disease stroke whatever we take dominion over confusion we take dominion over it and we cast it down today we are the sons of the most high god we stand on the promise of god's word today in jesus name amen amen amen if y'all remain just a moment please and i'm going to let the church be seated the audience it's good to be in the house of the lord today and we want to welcome those that have joined with us online wherever you are around the world and whether it's today tomorrow the next week whatever um it's great to have you to join with us in this moment in this time the lord is gracious see brother kenny in church today and he was headed to church the other day and i had a little accident and um celebrator stuck but the lord stuck with him amen so we have more than accelerator stuck and then we had a lord that stuck with him and brought him through that and we want to thank the lord that's uh twice here in the last little bit the devil's tried to do something to one of our people like that but we're claiming on the word of promise that no weapon no weapon formed against is going to prosper amen good to see you brother and sister stanky today great great to see you in service as well as everybody else that has come and enjoyed your song brother robson amen that was wonderful it ministered to me amen how many likes to see young people serve god i'll tell you it blesses my heart too i want to thank everyone for your prayers um we have sister karen in church with us today she was dismissed from the hospital as you know on wednesday and we returned home and the hospital called wanting us to return because one of the tests showed a mass in her heart and you know we had that wonderful service on wednesday where brother timothy priest and we anointed her with oil and the saints here gathered around and prayed and the church prayed and i took her to the hospital on thursday and i did a heart echo i was run on her that was so sure you know that they they were gonna have to do something uh and they kept to so they actually admitted her in the hospital because we you know we're just so sure of what we've already seen but we're gonna run this heart echo and and um well that evening they had to release us let us go home because they saw no sign of anything amen we we believe that god has answered prayer and amen and that he that started the work is going to finish that work amen so she's dealt with a little bit of confusion and and so on like that we're not sure of all the issues but it really matters not what devil we call it we know who is the lord the redeemer amen now sometimes we only mention a few of those that have been healed by the power of god and and uh so we commonly uh speak about sister lana healed from cancer and by the way she just went back for another doctor's report and and uh she had perfect blood work said don't come back for a year so she went from six months check up to a year and so god's continuing that victory and her life and we want to thank god for that it was an absolute miracle the doctors themselves said the the medicine itself would kill her but um you know we we serve a god who answers prayer and uh so we also speak about sister mariah who was healed of alopecia and it was an incurable um disease there that took away her hair and we saw god come on the scene for that we had drew that could not walk and when the angel of god swept into my house uh healing my wife and restoring her eyesight um there after a major brain bleed back in 2015 you know we we so we've seen so many things that god has done and there's been many many others that have been healed by the power of god and you know we have the dunn family that has been coming to church uh you know when some quit during covet and god raised up some to take their place so they come and um they're here in the service we baptized them and you know when um his mother uh when the little sister shasta got saved you know she something about it just raises your faith to the level of the promised lord if you can save me from sin you can also heal diseases and little luke there was born with a hundred percent hearing loss can only hear by hearing aid bone conduction and when his mother got saved newborn christian laid her hand on her child in the service and uh that week as they were around after the that service the child just took off his hearing aid and said mama i don't need this anymore i can hear good without it amen so she he has been healed of his and that's now marks a year and he still don't have to wear a hearing aid amen so you know he's still healed today his brother gary stanky was dying in the hospital that god miraculously raised up from a death condition there brother ron spencer we mentioned who the lord sent us to his bedside where he lay brain dead and they were about to harvest his organs and god raised him back to health again how many testimonies could we tell of brother kenneth and amanda's that that god has over and over brought deliverance to and uh little judah oglesby was born with uh dysfunctional kidneys that god totally healed and restored and brother david dexter who had a horrible eye disease and god totally healed and so you know there's just been many many things it's not just one or two that we mention but there is a merit in fact to the matter i just want to want to just ask today how many here that you know that god's healing power has worked in your life and you've been healed by the mighty power of god maybe not today or this year but somewhere back in your past you know you have been healed by the mighty power of god i want you to stand to your feet now take that devil take that devil amen not one not two not a few now anybody that's not sitting you can stand right now while i have you on your feet i want to talk about the salvation of souls and the importance of building up and adding to the experience of our young people amen i think uh you know they they are a great asset to our church and we have some real spirit-filled believers that um are in our young people group that we're so thankful to the lord far um you know i i got compliments from a man on who messaged me and thinking i was timothy really and he said i want to compliment you on your you're a parenting said you've got the two finest boys that i've ever seen and said i want my own boy to learn how to work like they do and how the ethics and the respect and the and the and and the kind of testimony they have and uh you know i'll tell you where you get that you find that in jesus amen you get them filled with the holy ghost and god changes lives and it's really his parenting that does that now brother timothy and brother andrew spencer are speaking at a youth camp in ohio this hosted by brother ray erickson's church brother wayne lawson there and them there's somebody else organizing it but it's that church that's hosting it and there we have close to 50 i think the number was 47 but close to 50 you know that have signed up to go and today i've signed papers on a bus to take them at the cost of close to 8 dollars now we've never had to do this in this church before because we've hosted the youth camp but for two two easter's we've not been able to have the camp and uh due to the coveted situation and some crisis problems the camp had and so on like that it just made it impossible we will be having youth camp next year so keep that in mind over easter but um you know we have today people are not going grandparents and uncles and aunts and brothers and sisters and friends and maybe you're not going um to to camp yourself but um maybe you want to contribute and be a part of this work of evangelism and support the youth um to go so i don't know the trustees are here already and they've taken up an offering this morning so i'm going to do the unusual i'm i'm and if we don't get the uh the the amount today to to rent that bus or to lease it for the uh with the drivers to go to ohio we don't get that money today i'll take up another offering and um in another week or two and and uh but we're going to send these young people to camp amen so i want you if you if you got an extra dollar that you want to donate to someone maybe that can't go if you're going well put your money towards your your camp fee and whatever else there and uh but we're going to take up an offer and so come on brothers right now as we come we just ask god to bless it now in jesus name as this offering is taken we're going to in the key of c it's jesus on the inside working on

today amen this is a house of praise this allows you to get going with god this is how perhaps we can shout we can rejoice for the king is in our midst amen amen thank you lord amen turn with me to revelation chapter 12 and verse 7 and as we you know do that i want to admonish you and remind you every time that we sing and we worship god you parents you turn and look at your little children see that they're participating we're all worshipping let everything that have breath praise ye the lord amen amen it's one thing for little ones to sleep but you know when they're 10 or 12 years old and they're still sleeping in church it's bad parenting on your part amen it's not the kids fault you we got a parent problem amen so let's look here in revelation chapter 12 verse 7 and i'm gonna if i make it mine i'll make you glad and hallelujah but we're gonna have church today i'm in rare form today i'm here to defeat devils i'm here as an overcomer i'm here because we're victorious i'm not here playing church i'm here because that greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world i'm not here to lose the battle i'm here to win a battle and i'm here to battle i'll tell you that amen revelation chapter 12 verse 7 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought in the dragon and against the dragon that the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil in satan which deceived the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength in the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame them by the blood the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives and to the death therefore rejoicing heavens and ye that dwell in them and woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having a great wrath because he knoweth he hath but a short time amen and sister abigail i didn't put this in my notes this morning but daniel chapter 12 and verse 1 i just feel like reading that down through verse 4 so keep up with me and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince was standing for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble like we're in such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time that people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall await some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever but thou daniel set up the words and the book and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased and god bless you as you have your seats looking here in this in this scripture today taking these thoughts in mind we're going to be speaking here from um as we speak on the people of the book because we are that people of the book and the book has been opened by the lamb today and it brings us our inheritance but when we speak it on the battle in two worlds the battle in two worlds we're going to be talking about those two worlds here um as we um identify them and speak about them and if you notice that there in our scripture reading there was a battle that was happening in the heavens but then daniel tells us that there was trouble on the earth so you know again heaven's battles reach down to earth and affects us where we are here upon the earth now so there are two worlds a natural world that we live in physically and a supernatural world now adam was a dual-natured individual he was made to live in two worlds at the same time animals were created with a body and a spirit but adam was created in the image of god and he had an extra part he had a body of spirit and a soul and so he was a triune being and his soul realm allowed him to be in heaven while he was here on the earth and he ruled on the earth not with earthly contact of see taste smell filling here but he ruled with authority from heaven's realm and he brought heaven's atmosphere down to earth this made the garden in which he lived an eden it made it a true garden instead of a howling wilderness even even now that's the way sons of god are to rule is by the word and with the word take preeminence over atmospheres now um the battle of course as you know is over preeminence we've took a couple of times on that and and it is over your position of sonship and it is a battle amen i showed you last sunday and i'm going to review just a moment but show you last sunday when adam fell that satan took lordship over man and became the accuser of the brethren and he was and of course he will even accuse you in heaven before god and contesting your rights to your position to sit with christ in dominion so he's doing everything for for to get you to keep you from taking dominion taking authority using your authority of sonship amen now as um as we looked in the book of job and job one and six shows us that when the sons of god appear before god that satan appears with them accusing and also he does it to exercise his in contrast um you know their rights as sons to stand there so he's standing there with them and accusing them contesting their rights of their righteousness toward god and they're standing with with god are you with me and so then we know as a tormentor he walks to and fro as the bible says in the next verse abigail that um that he he's going to and fro in the earth from walking up and down it and so as a tormentor he walks to and fro and stirs up strife and nations strife and families strife in the weather with typhoons and floods and hurricanes and destruction of every kind insurance wants to call that an act of god god didn't do that it come because of the fall now na the nature that adam wants control which was uh even the weather as adam was brother branham would demonstrate he he would say to uh he would say oh that breeze is kind of cool there adam and he said peace be still and you know he controlled he controlled the whole garden there by the word of god right amen but now when when sin entered in um you know that the nature that adam wants control now begins to control his thoughts what is what you ask everybody every day you know a hot day isn't it you know how's the weather there you know all everybody talks about weather right amen well at least in louisiana you do because you know you're either freezing or burning so anyway and you know nature that wants control now controls his thoughts it torches efforts it freezes and burns and brings torments of famine and and every kind of destruction and so all of this happens under satanic lordship over mankind and his earthly home now in the we we also saw in the book of zechariah that that joshua the high priest appeared before god this is three and one um and satan is at his right hand to oppose him or to resist him so he is there as a tormentor resisting are you with me so this is his job as a tormentor to resist you every time that you step into god's presence every time you go to make an appeal before the throne satan is there resisting bringing every thought every kind of accusation come on telling you your unworthiness i mean it begins a battle the moment you go to prayer the washing comes to mind and something has to be done and the yard's got to be mowed and you know your busyness of life and you know everything you sit in church and you think well i'm in church and now there's no battle no battle the church is a battleground you're going to battle to keep your thoughts on god amen you're going to battle to to to press through your heaviness through the darkness through your feelings you're going to battle every service is a battle amen and so you know we found that jesus was no exception as the first one filled with the spirit whom the spirit would really indwell and and not simply anoint but in 12 jesus having received his position of sonship when heaven opened and and the dove came down and the bar one the spirit like a dub came down and and here he god's voice spoke out and told him he said this you are the son i love you're the son i love you remember this is exactly the same thing happens when anyone gets filled with the holy ghost it is when heaven opens and the holy spirit comes down and he says you're my son you're my daughter and god puts a claim on your life are you with me amen but then the tempter came in matthew 4 3 and it tempts him comes and accuses him the first thing that he does after receiving the spirit of god and that great anointing came upon him to live in him he said when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god always questioning authority always try to trying to talk you out of your dominion you're trying to get you to lay your weapon down you have the word come on but if you if if satan can get you to disbelieve your weapon he's got you disarmed amen you've got to stand there with the word what god said i am not how i feel today now how not how human i felt and how human i've acted but who i am what he said i am i am who i am because the i am said i am now so you see again jesus had to fight with satan in order to operate as a son from the heavenly realm it was well his position was questioned and although he was the son of god his his dominion only was in recognizing who he was and operating as a son of god with power and authority uh from his position of sonship in the heavenlies notice it was heaven gave him that position he didn't have that position necessarily on earth with earthly governments rome didn't recognize that come on even the even the pharisees sadducees that the jews the herodians none of them recognized that he wasn't recognized at the temple but in heaven he was recognized as the son of god and heaven there because of that he had a representation in heaven were that he was ruling there and would take over that take dominion over satan and his powers right here on the earth now again the battle was over would god's word have preeminence or would satan's doubt have preeminence and that's where the battle is today by the lines are drawn which one's going to have preemptions now jesus known his position he cast out devils by the authority of his sonship he took the position in the word he healed the sick by the authority of his sonship he literally brought heaven's rule to the earth is that right he did not go like a doctor would and do a surgery on a man and remove a tumor he spoke to it and it left is that right he he commanded the light to come out of the devil in there jesus didn't jesus didn't deal in in the flesh realm he was dealing in the spirit realm and i want you to understand that's where your battle is it's not in the flesh realm it's in the spirit realm now so jesus know in his position cast out devils brought heaven's rule to the earth and in matthew 4 23 he went about all galilee teaching in their synagogue preaching the gospel of the kingdom healing all manner of sickness and manner all manner of diseases among people among the people let me tell you again we got a lot of teachers in the land today but very few preachers to preach the gospel is to bring deliverance and with that comes healing of sickness and all manner of diseases and if that ain't happening then i'll tell you you're not here and preaching you're here in exhortations of teaching now i mean well we teach doctrine listen jesus doctrine what's different from the pharisees doctrine is that that demons heard his word and had to obey him never heard we a man speak like this man amen so real preaching there cast satan out i'm expecting into every service that i preach for demons to lead people doubt and fear and unbelief about even false doctrines and things that have tried to hold on to you so that and so the revelation come and strike your heart amen because with the preaching the word comes the casting out of satan i have been anointed as a preacher of the gospel to to cast satan's kingdom down we're tearing it down little by little break my breath stone by but we are overcoming we'll take another stone or another wall or another piece of oil but it's all coming down satan has no right to us amen now in luke chapter 10 we see jesus authorized 70 to act by the authority of his position by acting in his name so you know these people weren't even yet saved the holy ghost should not even come but they could actually act in the authority of jesus name amen just realizing that jesus had paid the price or that he had given them that authority amen and with his authority using his name they took dominion over devils now i want you to notice this is this is uh where he said in in verse luke 10 17 and the 70 re returning again with joy saying lord even devils are subject unto us through thy name amen verse 18 and he said unto them i beheld as satan as lightning falls from heaven notice they went out to to preach the gospel to cast out devils this is what he commits them to and here they come back and said we've done the job we saw the devil cast out and they're rejoicing about it and he said unto them he said i saw satan as lightning fall from heaven so when believers take their position amen when they take even the authority of jesus name and begin to operate in that authority hallelujah amen these were not even holy ghost field ones yet the day of pentecost didn't come but they believed what jesus told them if i can get you to believe nothing will stand before our prayers not even cancer that's what the angel told us that's what he told the prophet of god come on amen if the people start believing hallelujah i don't care you might have been just a newborn christian just got saved just like sister shasta amen but you got this much right and authority to lay your hands on your death child or any other problem and command the devil to go hallelujah it don't take a long history of serving god it takes one moment of believing i'll tell you why you're believing amen don't stop delivering devils defeated [Applause] hallelujah take a hold of it that same god that healed you of one thing heal your son luke of a death problem will take away bipolar conditions or any kind of depression or even the the wickedness of your past make you white as snow but you've got to believe what god's word said and you've got to realize this is what he said about me hallelujah that though my sins were escarted they're not white as snow though they were red like crimson they're white light wool as far as jesus from the west i've removed your sins from you so yeah jesus said i saw a great a great battle in the spirit he says behold i give you power verse 19. i give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing somebody say nothing amen whatever you're going through put the name there it's nothing did somebody hear that it's nothing nothing shall by any means hurt you am i but this is war turn with me to ephesians 6 11 put on the whole armor of god what why in the world is he dressing you up like a soldier and you're not going to fight he didn't say no i'm making you a christian and you're going on a picnic and i've given you this land and you're just going to go in there and enjoy the benefits of it no he said you're going to go in there and you're going to chase out the enemy hallelujah god gave you healing but you're going to chase out the enemy god gave you salvation but you're going to chase out the enemy amen you're going to you're going to you're going to bind together you're going to believe together you're going to pray you're going to expect you're going to put faith to work you're going to take the sword in the hand of faith because unbelief won't hold the sword it'll drop it every time now so you got to dress for war you put on the full armor of god that's his precepts they're like the armor of a heavily armed soldier so that you may be able to successfully stand up not just stand up successfully stand up did you read what i read in revelations 12 that lucifer fought and prevailed not that shouting ground's for you today he's not going to win you're going to come out of this victorious amen satan is already prophesied in the scripture to be defeated you're are dealing with an already defeated enemy [Applause] hallelujah and i'm giving him some depression this morning amen and i'm reminding him that his limbs are the lake of fire hallelujah but i've reminded him that i will never end because i never did begin i was in his thoughts and eternal thoughts of god before the foundational world and i'm not a temporary being when he's gone i'll still be here whatever devil is burning in hell i'll still be shouting the victory now so you can stand up against all the schemes and the strategies and deceits of the devil verse 12 we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities principalities these are wicked devils these are ruling devils these are these are governments satanic governments against powers against rulers yes we're not just against the peon soldiers of the devils we're against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places now i want to remind you when you read high places there that's heavenly places exact same word that is spilled that spoke up in ephesians chapter one that he has met uh that made us to sit together with him in heavenly places so our battle is for heavenly places and so it's a battle in and not just this world but another world also and that's what you're seeing and and and daniel you know when when that when there he the book of daniel when gabriel tells i would have been here you've been praying for three weeks and i'd have been here the first day you called but i was opposed by the prince of persia and i had to battle it out and i would still be battling if i hadn't called for michael to come help me angelic battles in heavenly places affecting things happening on earth and daniel's having to persevere daniel's having to pray harder daniel can't give up come on if he gives up the angel never comes because what happens in the heaven depends on your reaction on earth you start doubting the angel can't come to you he cannot respond to your doubt he can only respond to your faith [Music] now here's a translation that paraphrases this verse god is strong and he wants you strong amen remember sister karen remember what i've been telling you what you've been saying let the week say what i'm strong let the week say not i'm weak don't confess your weakness confess what god said about you let the weak said i'm strong amen profess what his word said about you not how you're feeling [Music] now this as i'm reading this translation it's a paraphrase really kind of like an amplified but said so take everything the master has set up for your well-made weapons of the best material dress yourself in all of it and put them to you so you'll be able to stand up to everything the devil throws your way this is no weekend war that we'll walk away from and forget about in a couple hours this is for keeps it's a life or death fight to the finish and against the devil and all his angels don't let that pass over your head and man it's not something you're just going to walk away from you young people say well i got the holy ghost there'll never be a fight no more no there's a fight all the way amen you say well brother tim i got the victory the other day that i'll never see that devil let me tell you something when david took the head off of goliath how many more wars did they have after that [Applause] they defeated the philistines that time and chased them out of the land but did they come again yes they came again will the devil come again yes he'll come again and then he'll try to confess you can convince you it didn't really matter that you cut the day ahead off of goliath it didn't count anyway we're back here in bigger numbers now so it's a life or death fight to the finish am i when i when i get through with my battle when i come down to rapture out i want them to have to pry my fingers off of the sword of the word of god before i put it down back down in my scabbard where i fight no more until then i want to fight devils until my hand cleans it sticks to the sword you can't try it off now we got to be determined to fight in some very deep pits and you don't know what lays before you i have no idea either but we got to determine to to fight in some very deep pits but we're david's mighty men come on church banaya the son of jehoiada the son of a violet man of of cabzille done mighty axe slew two lying men like me lying like men of moab he went down also and slew a line in the midst of a pit in the time of snow he was he was fighting enemies that had the advantage over him and he had to go down into the pit to destroy an enemy and you may have to go down in a pit to see an enemy destroyed brother gary you had to go down in a pit a very low place to see an enemy destroyed but you came out of it amen you came out of it hallelujah he slew him a a an egyptian a goodly man and he had a spear in his hand he went down with his stuff in his hand against the man with his fear and he took the spirit away from the egyptian and slew him with his own spirit i'll tell you sometimes you gotta slay the devil with his own words [Applause] brother branham said when he went to pray through for the holy ghost he said the devil said you so you've already sent away your day of grace he said i just used it against him and i said oh god then this is my chance it's my only chance and here here it is if i've sinned away i'm gonna knock on before over and over and over again i'm not giving up i must persevere i must have it now our battles are not against physical people we are not fighting against people made of flesh and blood but against if we call them people spirits without bodies evil rulers of the unseen world mighty satanic beings and great evil princes of darkness who rule this world jesus acknowledged they did he said to him the prince of this world has come hath no part in me so he acknowledged that he was prince of this world and against huge numbers of wicked spirits in the spirit world so now there is a natural world and there is a spirit world brother branham many times didn't deal with things in in the natural he was dealing with things in the spirit you know like the maniac they come and run it up and said with the young men policeman to come and subdue the maniac that had come to threaten his life and and going to hit him and all of that and and they wanted to know you know can we help and he waved him away he said this is not a flesh and blood affair this is a spiritual battle i'm not dealing with the man and the physical man i'm dealing with the devil there that has possessed him now so brother adam didn't deal with him in the natural means he dealt with him in a spiritual me the man did everything he could to get him in the natural get him in the flesh hop down spit him in the face trying to make him mad cursing him calling him ever got a name wouldn't that kind of get you in the flesh amen he was trying to get brother branham in the flesh amen but he refused to get in the flesh and he spoke to the spirit in the man now you're going to have to understand this is not physical it's spiritual and you you look at your ailment you look at your sickness you see the problems and you think it's physical it isn't physical it's spiritual you say i i've got a i've got a cataract well brother branham would take a person in his with his left hand and hold in their right hand and and there the disease would show because it was a germ disease oh well science may not say it was a germ disease but it so happened it reacted on brother branham oh today they just go and do a cut and take a surgery and take it out but you know in brother bratton's time there was no no cure for that medically they just want that but brother random never did a surgery he spoke to the spirit and it died now watch this as we go in when sin entered and darkness sin darkened and closed adam's access to the throne of sonship he's still a man he's still a man still he was actually more human than ever because now he's mortal after sin come in he's more human than ever what'd he do he was separated from his sonship and his sonship authority now what adam did jesus came to restore to restore a people back to sonship authority now man fell from his position not on the earth but he still ruled the earth but he lost his ability to rule the earth and control its atmosphere as a sun now adam still had human strength and can do mighty things with his intellect and the sweat of his brow look at the things that man accomplishes there's a lot of things with the sweat of his brow but you see that was not the way before the fall it was by the word that he ruled all things as the son of god he spoke and it happened he said to a tree be plucked up and moved over here how do we know that because the second adam said we can do it is that right amen the second adam said we could move a mountain the second adam there could have spoke to nature and made the seas and the winds obey him so we know then by that what the first adam did amen now and then of course the curse made him have to do everything by the sweat of his brows so we know something from that before that he didn't have to sweat to do it it wasn't with human efforts but now we come down to our moment in time our battle is not a flesh and blood battle it's about operating from the heavenly realm by the power of the word now before the fall literally adam literally brought heaven down to earth even the animals were ruled by heaven's atmosphere it was like it would be in the millennium the garden was like a millennium you know the lion lay down with the lamb you know any deliverance from sin is by bringing heaven's dominion over that sin it comes by making satan fall from having dominion and the word of faith empowers a person to rise above sin and take dominion that's salvation when we talk about salvation that means we have been given dominion over sin sin no longer rules us romans 6 tells us so we are no longer servants of sins sin is now our slave we tell it what to do it does not tell us what to do now it makes a man or a woman to rule over evil spirits from their throne of sonship your relationship to god empowers you and makes you a ruler when you believe you are literally casting out devils hallelujah you as a child of god you live in two worlds as a as a child of god you know you're you're living two worlds you were born the world by your first birth but you're born of heaven by your new birth so we are a people fleshly we got a citizenship on the earth but heavenly we got a heavenly citizenship amen we're here still working and doing by the sweat of our brow but at the same time we're sons of god and we are to control by bringing heaven's atmosphere down into the church into our family into our body hallelujah this is what your job is to do your battle is not flesh and blood but it's against principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness and rulers and high places amen now when man sinned he lost access to being able to live in heavenly places he lost his throne he lost his domain you know that's what edom eden was it was an extension of heaven upon the earth and that realm god become would be visible and that realm his voice was plainly heard amen adam would hear the voice of god walking in the cool of the day god walked among them is that right amen in that realm the word worked through his lips with creative power as he kept the garden he didn't use a shovel and dig up a tree to move it with the sweat of his brow do it or get a chainsaw if it was too big and cut it up and burn it the way he moved it was by the word now so adam was a son of god his father the almighty he would the almighty god with faith filled words brought the universe into existence and adam kept the garden the same way by faith filled words and i'm just gonna tell you that's the only way you'll keep your garden today is with faith filled words the animals as we said were in perfect harmony always controlled by heaven's atmosphere the access though to to the sense of faith and by sin was closed off and and faith was turned to unbelief remember you're like a magnet you've got a pole that on one side that pulls and the other resists amen when malachi 4 came to turn to heart you know what our condition was we were pulled toward the world we were pulled toward creeds we were pulled toward the prince of darkness we were pulled through spiritual sin physical sin all kinds of sin but when the word came he turned our heart amen now we push away the world and we're pulled toward god malachi 4 came to turn you from unbelief back to faith again but to do so it had to turn the heart because our faith remember unbelief is just faith really aimed in the wrong direction you gotta have a lot of faith to believe there is no god you gotta have a lot of faith to believe we came from monkeys you gotta have a lot of faith to think that two asses rub their asses our acids rubbed together and with the rubbing of those acids that that they're um that they're all sun light sprung out of you gotta have a lot of faith to believe that amen amen but i'll tell you you know it takes a lot of faith to be an atheist wait a minute let me just talk about it they want to talk about theory about evolution and they're preaching that in the schools like it's a fact it is not about it is a theory and it's not even proven and you are basing your belief on a lie and you have to believe a lie that will damn you and to disbelieve god is a lie that will damn you and to do that you got to turn down amen you got you can't even look at a blade of grass without knowing there's a god in heaven that would cause it to come into being amen you cannot look at the earth in this position in the earth and know that some ham had to put it there in perfect order at a perfect place at a perfect spot when you get down to all your questions you look in the blade of grass and okay where did that come from and how far you know how you're going to have to come down to in the beginning god there's no other answer i said there's no other answer now when man sinned he was left with only the five senses to contact the world we live in modern man knows that there are things that i cannot see that just a few generations ago was totally unknown to man by microscopes the world the man has discovered a world that was previously unknown to man and with the scientific achievements of the microscope has has brought that which was once invisible and made them visible amen but before this it was a world that was unknown that's right now i i'm telling you you're living in word with knowing of worlds today that other agents didn't know about coming on down for a minute the fourth dimension of radio waves it's a realm that is real how many can see a radio waves out there today well if i had a radio up here i'd wave it for you but that'd be the only way you'll see a wave radio wave moving through this room are invisible waves that contain voices that our ears cannot hear these waves contain also contain pictures that our eyes cannot see not obscure in images but images in living color voices that are exactly like the voice of the one who spoke it 200 years ago mankind did not know how to harness invisible waves uh and the invisible energy of electricity to think today we think nothing of it we plug an appliance into the receptacle and you we use it's energy to to power them we can't see the electricity it's invisible to the eye but we can feel it how many has ever felt electricity oh yeah now these modern advances has brought the invisible and made them visible made some things that was intangible and made them tangible voices that are audio audible invisible energies made them usable thus we live in a world that would have been foreign to people of past ages but just as real as electricity and television and radio there is a heaven and it is it was just as real to adam as the world we now live in now although it's invisible you believe you're convinced of it we know it because we've been born again and though our five senses can't recognize it i can't see electricity i can't see radio waves amen i can't see a lot of that with but i know it's there amen also also i know we know that because we've been born again though our five senses won't declare it amen but we know exist by our god-given sense of faith now so here we're both we're born in a fallen body a mortal body that was given us by fall his eyes are now invisible to what adam used to think common he saw all the time he saw and then heard god walking in the cool of the day angels ascending descending oh the heaven and its atmosphere and he could bring it down to the earth but now we're because of the fall there that we we are we were made subject now just to five senses what we can see what we can taste what we can feel what we can hear now so again you you know you you can see things now as i said in this in this age things that was once invisible you see them microscopes hubble telescope brings worlds that we never knew about now but what i'm trying to tell you there is a heavenly round but what keeps us from seeing everything in the heavens why what is it that keeps heaven from being real to our flesh our fallen man amen it's the veil that keeps us from seeing right now i want to tell you angels are standing by your seats the pillar of fire is in this church amen god is with his people hallelujah jesus is here because he said work two or more gather in my name i'll be there now your eye may not see it your hearing may not declare it but it's as real as radio waves it's as real as what a microscope can see in an invisible world it's a real world as what we are seeing around us you are people that are actually a supernatural people you are looking beyond the natural into a supernatural realm even as a physical person you are looking in realms today no other age is ever looked at [Applause] you are using energies from realms that was previously unknown to man as to how to capture it and use it now but this veil keeps us this flesh that we were born with it keeps us from seeing god here it keeps us from seeing angels present but it's still here and when you drop this flash veil senator i want to talk to you a minute when you drop this flesh veil the unknown world is going to suddenly become really real to you christian heaven and all its joys and angels and saints and all of them come on they're one breath away looking on the other hand center demons tormentors fallen pit one breath away [Music] now it's another world and when you drop this this flesh veil the light will come on to your faith sense and you will i'm telling you there won't be one atheist in heaven every person that dies he's no longer an atheist that's right he knows there's a realm a man he knows there's something he'll see things he'll experience things that he could not see with his eyes he will see what has tormented him he will see what has troubled him and ruled his life what he gave dripped to and was obedient and a servant to one breath away from here is another world now a world for us that has no yesterdays or tomorrows because it's an eternal realm but right now with the sense of faith i'm going to tell you you can actually push past the flesh and contact the supernatural world some of you think oh it's just human emotions that people get up and they shout and they dance around well occasionally we have some people that are in the flesh and i don't say this that's not really a big problem either somebody say well i was in the flesh and i shouted well praise the god you shouted it'd be better for you to be in the flesh and shout and then be in flesh and resist the spirit and refuse to praise god come on amen i'm not advocating a bunch of fleshly manifestations but i'm just saying you know it's not all bad hallelujah i can shout whether i feel the spirit or not i can dance because it means just because i know the word of god is true and its promises are real and they are mine i can rejoice in it hallelujah whether i feel it or not hey now there's one thing i can't do very well and that's preached without the anointing amen but i tell you when the anointing comes i can preach because i've been commissioned to do that but listen when you die it's only continuing to this same life in another world and in other places why jesus said i go to prepare a place for you a place it's a real place heaven is a real place heavenly places are real places angels are there and it's not that far away they're right there by you angels standing by you at your seat the holy spirit present the pillar of fire is here every manifestation of god is present among us today amen now when you die of course you go out of the existence of people who can see you and you go into god's presence no longer can they see you you go out of their sight you're not in this world no more you're in another world there in that world they knew what was going on and back on earth there in that world they rejoice when sinners repent hallelujah amen there in that world they you know there there are those of the thousands it comes down to to greet those new arrivals amen there in that world is is is indescribable it's it's blissful it's wonderful it's but it's a dimension higher than than even what we're speaking of of the realm of the holy ghost now you're dying you died to the mortal part but you're alive here but your spirit is right here with christ when you die you wasn't you see you wasn't made even to live in the heavens like that all the er all the time so you'll be coming back to earth taking on bodies again amen and and again but when god will let your spirit loose comes out of the sixth dimension and to the fifth and the into light petroleums and petroleums the senses and you're back on the earth again a brand new person not a not old or not not a baby but never to be sick or never broke down your hair will never turn gray i mean you'll never be hungry you never have a worry you walk with your loved ones just shake their hands and you'll eat and drink and build houses and inhabit them people get the idea well when we get to heaven we're just going to do a bunch of shouting we will do a bunch of satan but we're going to even up on the earth when we bring heaven down to the earth in the millennium we'll build a not another inhabit amen the the the bible said that elect will enjoy long enjoy the labor of their hands are you with me now so again when jesus returned we will meet him in the air you know what's going to happen he will literally just become visible he's already in the heavens and we will meet him in the air we'll meet him in heavenly places he'll just become visible because what we'll be changed but you won't seem until you're changed amen and we'll meet him in the air but he's already with us here now we don't have to wait to the body change to be in his presence he's right here among us now it's another world and the lord jesus is in another world another dimension right here today in the form of the holy spirit and his spirit is blended with our spirits our eyes can't see him because they're still physical our hearing don't hear because they're still physical our feelings you don't really feel him with your hands you feel it with your spirit round you know that he's present amen why you you know you're you've can feel because he can be just as real as what he was to those who walked on the road to emmaus are just as real as he was to marry at the grave come on somebody amen it can be felt with the inner charge that's on the inside of the human body by the new birth the soul has been magnetized to him and and if you let your mind just become consecrated to him believing on him after a while something in reality can sweep over your being that you know and it's a vindication of his resurrection i know i've had it happen hey man i was in rob spencer's house here last year in the month of february and there in the bedroom there i was awakened and sat up in my bed hearing the song we heard wednesday night we shall see miracles we shall see giants fall we'll welcome water and i'll tell you as we've heard the word of god come to us it'll be a series of victories hallelujah well if there's a series of victories there's a series of war and we have been in war and i'm in war and i'm a battle but i ain't backing up and i ain't moving hallelujah i'm pursuing the enemy i'm going to chase him and one of us can face a thousand and two of us can chase ten thousand hallelujah because there's unity power in unity hallelujah he's risen from the dead he's right here with you he's in this building this morning i can't see do you see radio waves you see those people who are passing through this building in living colors well no but if i set up a television you would if i put on turn on the radio you would all of a sudden that that would be a receiver from that transmitter receiving receiving that wave are you with me amen but again that other realm i'm telling you is just as real can i just say it it's actually more real than television or radio [Applause] he's here in the form of the holy ghost jesus has moved from the corporal body into the celestial in a body that's unseen with the eye there's another world there's angels here it's not the way way somewhere else it's right here the angels of god are in camp don't move away they're encamped about those that fear him i just read you a quote if you didn't understand now so again that he's in an unseen condition you can't see him with your eyes i don't see god well i tell you what you get enough god in you you'll see him everywhere you'll see him in nature you'll see him in the sunset you'll see in creation you'll see him in one another you'll see him in the church you'll see his mighty hand but you got to get god on the inside of you first or you'll never see god amen now my angels are placed around in this room watching angels of god and camped about those that fear him remember elijah down at dalton he didn't come and call down angels he said god just opened this boy's eyes the angels were already there but he couldn't see him with physical eyes it was an anointing that anointed something in his realm of his soul that allowed him to see now christian believers can believe that present now they are sitting in heavenly places amen they're fellowshipping around the word of god the holy spirit taking the word of god by vision moving it out into every heart as the word is going forth and every believer receive it or if we could just stand and claim our god-given privileges that's the time that god could ever take the whisper not a person's back and put a real old-fashioned gospel backbone in him somebody who'll stand for truth no matter how dark it looks now you know and i know we're not of this world i'm trying to hurry now our citizenship is of heaven that's right and notice now when the holy spirit comes to you i'm quoting from brother branham that you're a candidate for the association with the unseen world and and the supernatural no wonder people can't believe in those things they never come in contact they never got anything in here to believe with but when the holy spirit comes to heart quickly he becomes a two-fold being amen look at your neighbor and say you're a two-fold man all right so what is it in your body you're still subject to death but in your soul you pass some death to life is that right your body you have earthly contact with your senses five senses in the spirit has contact with god through the holy ghost and the angels of god visits them and speaks with them and they're messengers sent from god to reveal and to bring messages from god to the individual hallelujah being born again you are candidates for the unseen world hallelujah now you're not of this world you're not germans or americans or canadians or this or that french or belgium's or swiss or africom's or africans or are americans we're none of them not even pecans we're christians i said that to wake some of you up nudge your pecan next to him get that nut out of the shell all right so we're christians we're we don't act like americans because we got christ on the inside amen we don't dress like americans because we got christ on the inside amen the holy spirit coming from god out of heaven makes you act different remember because you're of another world brother branham said you're as much of an alien in this world as if you would be if you stepped out into the jungles of africa amen you're born again christian is an oddball to the world you're not to be like them you're you're changed you are different now we live in three worlds the three worlds we live in is in the sense of our three realms i mean that's light and matter and time we were blinded as sin to our position of sonship in christ and that heavenly round and so but you know we we have these three realms as it was that we live in we're controlled by three different things life matter and time light from another round now if you don't believe your influence from another world stop for a minute and think 93 million miles away there is a light that provides energy here for life all life on the earth is by energy from another realm that we cannot touch so i can't touch god touch the sun come on amen you can't touch the sun either but you are living by its energy what happens light comes down upon the plant plant turns it through soda senses it turns that energy into food and then we eat the food there and we consume the energy from the sun your every life today is living from an energy from another world your spiritual life is the same you are living from the energy of another world you have been energized and empowered from another world that's where you get your energy amen it's from a place we cannot touch we are here we have matter that's a physical substance we can see taste meal feeling here and and then time we're creatures of time and controlled by time our bodies are made with an expiration date you're going to expire one day your body not you just the body part it's gonna expire you can't live in these bodies eternally now science has brought us into another realm of the fourth dimension mantra's discovery has tapped into the unseen world of germs they learned how to subdue them we have learned that there's a big world of the unseen and maybe a bigger world in what of the seen world that's right other men have found the invisible energy of electricity subdued it making it work for them there's radio waves radio television cell phones all work using invisible electromagnetic wave commonly known as radio waves the other day i facetimed some of my children that are out of town they saw me and they very image the colors i had the clothes i had the hair everything was the same my voice was the same what was it it traveled like a thought amount now these are radio waves these waves travel at the speed of light and i can talk to africa or japan across the world i can send my image there with a speed of light this is something unknown to man of the past man also uses these rays as microwaves to heat up food don't put your cat in the microwave to warm him up the little bitty short waves of the microwaves there will penetrate through the outside to the inside and cook it from the inside out you can look in there and you don't see a fire you can there you can't you can you know you hear something turning around you see the rotor of the thing turn around at the table inside but you can't see any of the waves to see anything hitting that food or touching that food it's all invisible i am trying to tell you we have tapped in in our day into the realms of the invisible and we have made them to work in our dimension and if god did that in the physical what about the spiritual so if i am proven to you there are unseen realms that you are working with all the time that you have now accepted as don't dismiss that there is a supernatural realm [Applause] now i want to talk about this for a moment because these waves will last indefinitely the radio waves will continue to travel until they're absorbed by something like gas or dust and they'll travel forever radiating from the earth the speed of light and at this stage at this stage they say our first radio transmission is now over a hundred a hundred light years away whatever that means because none of you really know what that means but i want to tell you something god sent us a seer spiritual scientist to show us the invisible god and make him real that heaven is real and that the resurrected one is present now it's a another dimension brother brandon said to the scientific world these three more mortals live in the other god lives in it and it's in a duel he said there's another world just out there where the supernatural is that's where god lives and that's what the holy spirit is he knows me and he knows you and it declares to us that there is a heaven and that's what brother branham would say you know this proves he is resurrected because he's here among us he knows your heart he knows your thoughts he can tell where you've been what your trouble is now in that realm it's infinite every move and action that you make is recorded even your most intimate thoughts amen and guess what it's going to be played back at the day of judgment even the clothes you wear will be showed at the face in your face at the day of judgment science has found that with television television doesn't manufacture a picture it only channels it telephone doesn't produce the voice it channels it the color of clothes every time you move every thought the jews in your mind is absolutely kept on god's record and that thing will be laid right before you one day all your dirty dresses i'm just going to quote brother branham say every time you went to the barber shop cut your that hair that god gave you it's going to be there you'll answer for it you can't make a move right there just even the thoughts of your heart while you're doing it will be played right before you how are you going to escape how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation we're not we're not going to escape every move the thoughts of the heart is recorded right in another dimension even the color of our closure where television color television proves it right out pulls it right out and shows it it's just in one dimension from the three that we live in just in one dimension from these three of light matter and time here comes another sound waves now brother branham's time he was told that if we could pick up an instrument that could catch it that a man's voice like my voice i speak that ten thousand years from now could be picked up in the air like dropping a pedal in the in the uh a pebble in the middle of a pond a teeny little waves as they fail to be seen by the eye continue until it hits the bank and the airwave of our voices continually travels around the world now science today tells us that science does that sound does not travel forever sound cannot travel through empty space it's carried by vibrations in a material or a medium like air or steel or wool water or wood and so on so the sound waves get smaller and smaller until it disappears and that's what science says however a spiritual scientist found that in the eternal realms of god where there's no yesterday's or tomorrow that voices what the doctor said or prayers that was even prayed or thoughts were recorded and could be played back and he would sometimes go back 40 years and what seems as though they were happening right now standing in two worlds one world he's on a platform before an audience and then standing and being in another world and in that world he could hear voices a thing said 40 years ago actions behaviors what the doctor said described as look color clothes a hat on you had on a little jumper your hair was in braids i see you running from a certain colored dog it was a yellow dog what was it all of those things are recorded so you see science may not be able to record the sound waves they say sound waves they just go and they get a sword maybe that's true in the natural but in the spiritual this scientist told us and proved it to us and then they could go back in time into a realm that's no yesterdays and tomorrows and there could bring back out right now right present what was said 40 years ago [Music] the things you say and do never die there's only one way to stop that voice and that's repentance say well brother tim we're going to go to heaven we're going to shout yeah we'll shout a while we'll praise god we'll enjoy one another's companies nobody will have to slip in a domino game or some kind of card game or whatever to keep us from being bored amen probably the first first three and a half years we'll just i enjoy shaking hands with abraham isaac and jacob and all the way down through paul and speaking and hearing testimonies and shouting having a great time at the marriage supper of the lamb but after that we're coming back from millennial reign and rule and reign with christ for a thousand years and after that's a white throne judgment and all these thoughts voices all of these things will then be played back and what was done in secret will be shattered from the housetop jesus declared this to be truth say well i don't believe this prophet thing well jesus said luke chapter 12 verse 2 for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and neither hid that shall not be known therefore whatsoever you have spoken what sign says oh it goes and you know the voice ends and it gets absorbed and you can never pick it up whatsoever is spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light and that would you have spoken in the ear in closets that's sacred shall be proclaimed from the housetop you don't want to wind up at the white throne judgment with your deeds and your actions because in that realm your thoughts are louder in heaven than what your words are on earth so you want to be careful what you're thinking because god knows the heart this is a problem a lot of people want the holy ghost but god knows a heart he can't come and live on an unclean vessel he knows when it's yielded to him he knows when it's surrendered and he ain't gonna come till it does therefore what we say will be our own judgment our testimony will rise against us our voices will echo in our own ear at the judgment bar of god when his great instrument catches every voice that's been spoken every word that's been muttered and there's only one thing that will stop it stop that voice and that that is wrong and that's repent because god alone can stop it i'm so glad that though your sins were like scarlet that can be white as snow i'm so glad it's such a way that when we stay there come on it won't be god with a big angel crossing out the cuss words there won't be any of it it was in the sea of his forgetfulness it is the bleach of his blood and even none of your actions will even be there hallelujah every evil thing gone because it can't be attributed to the seeding of god that is in you now scripture said let me read this from christ the mystery the angels of god are camped about those that fear him so in another world where the five senses do not declare the five senses only contacts this world if you had no feeling you could feel nothing feeling would have be nothing to you that would be another world if you had no sight uh you would what you look around in another world you know nothing about it so these five senses is the only thing that god let us loose to now there is another sense called faith but by faith you walk up a ladder and finally you get so high until you can break into another world which is visions and you can see and just like if you never see or never knew what this was you were feeling with your sense of feeling never seen it then your eyes come open you would see it it'd be all a mystery to that person who could never see it'd be a mystery them but it's real now listen brother branham didn't make himself that way he was gifted in a way that he was tuned by god by predestination fasting then bring it prayer didn't bring it down god ordained him a prophet amen and he tuned him down in a way that that he could stand there and and could be standing and and contact that realm and see in that realm and speak back into this round what he saw in that round and it'd be like you have a dream well you can't make yourself dream and you know you can't decide what you're going to dream it happens but i couldn't say go drink me a dream you couldn't ask brother brandon go see me a vision you see it wasn't that it was god operating it and he could be physically on the platform in a visible realm speaking before thousands and at the same time same moment be somewhere else in another in realm in an invisible realm taken there by light by the angel of the lord and he could be on the platform and at the same time be standing in a hospital room seeing events that took place years ago and hear conversations and doctors reports and names that were that that someone called that person you know all of these things he would see it or he would hear it in that other dimension now as he said as i'm speaking you see then the anointing comes it's another world god's got a tape recorder as it was a movie of every move you've ever made in your life you believe that he can reveal it just as he will he said you're living in two worlds you're in a world here your world there you're with somebody else maybe 50 years ago and maybe you're somebody you somebody years from the day to come and yet you realize you're standing on the platform here and you're speaking something that happened many many years ago maybe weeks ago months ago another nation another place or something and you try to keep yourself in straight in that thinking tell you it's quite a thing and he says for even what someone was thinking could be heard in that realm he called it the foreknowledge of god that told me what was and what will be like he said to miss weaver who was dying of cancer he says you're i can say you're going to be well because i see you in the vision going back behind the house to a chicken coop and i said mrs weaver thus saith the lord you'll make a trip to that chicken coop and you will live what was it it was seeing already what was happening in the foreknowledge of god amen come on church amen but it would also go back in your past [Music] amen it's another world and he said you believe in this room you can't see with your natural eyes but there's angels you believe god's here electronics proves that television's in the room you know voices radio in this room from a transmitter but we say there's a resurrected christ that's alive and and he says we're only a transmitter so christ is in the room and he is the god of the human race and surely he has some way he can contact his beings don't you think kind of like you're working in two worlds you're here in another world and when that goes out you go in and you see what's standing near the platform here angels of god and everything and you see hideous things that take place let's talk about that for a minute because as i showed you in the beginning in the realm there are spirits fighting that's right wars in heaven satan lucifer and his armies against michael and his angels hideous things demonics rulers darkness because when they fell they left the form of beautiful powerful angels when they see them to become hideous tormented spirits look at man let me just talk let's talk about fallen man in this fallen distance you can't stay young and beautiful try it ladies use olive olay every day come on everybody's loving these new pictures that they're taking i don't know what it is but anyway they take these pictures and you got this tight skin and you know young again and oh you know you know okay that's okay there it's only prophesying of something real i saw my mother like that a young woman no wrinkles skin tight she's 92 when she died she brought me a message from the other realm saying you're well thought of over here do you hear that devil heaven knows who i am you know who i am demons cried out paul i know jesus i know but who are you the devil's already found out who i am i've cast him out a number of times by the power of god it's my authority of sonship [Music] you say i you did it brother dear i admit it by the power of god and the authority of my sonship as a son of god i did it i didn't do it as a human now you look at matt look him out when he fell i want you to lock him just a minute my timer said i got two minutes and 40 40 seconds it'll go red here in a minute i'll go into overtime but you know the looking man when he fell in this falling condition pick up that arm of yours well not too high look at that broken thing it's not really broke he's had to have surgery he's not the man he used to be he went back yeah it's true you're in a dying body it's getting older hair's falling out i ain't i'm amen i was with a bunch of older brothers who were here back and brother kenny and them they were telling me all of their aches and pains and trouble and he looked at me and he said well what about you brother to him i said all is well i'm good he said well that bald spot on your head's getting bigger he wasn't letting me get by with you nothing and he found out he ain't the man he used to be lifted weights tore something had to go get surgery doctor

in a falling condition we can't stay young and beautiful we keep falling and falling until we die handsome men become stooped gray and withered kenny camp stand up for a minute yeah yeah come on stand up with me hallelujah show them you can stand up i mean this man right here was a football star he was a college he was a foot spot star he's no football star today why we're in a falling condition hey man i'm not going to pick out an old lady now tell how beautiful he used to be but handsome men become stooped and gray and withered fallen gray until their minds will decay amen human beings are fallen come on i told you i'm in rare form today now you see these angels are falling from their first original estate and if god judged the serpent and changed him from an upright creature to a slithering serpent if god if sin caused man to lose his immortality and become moral where he changes from youth to decrepit then what about angels that felt they're no longer beautiful angels and brother branham said i heard one the other day challenging me and i looked over and saw him he looked like alley-oop in the philly papers he was a deformed looking creature because while they're falling from their original estate he said i've seen one coming from a woman that looked like a bat with big hairs under his legs and and its wings come out as wet right straight up their evil spirit many times they're looking ever so beautiful on the outside someone's looking so beautiful on the outside but on the inside you can only look on the inside and see what's enthroned on the inside it ain't something pretty [Applause] amen these porn stars they're beautiful on the outside come on but you got a chance to look on the inside you would see a very ugly dirty filthy spirit a demon ruling that life out of their mind where they're taking clothes off i'm talking about another world i'm trying to hurry i'm two minutes into red now look there are evil spirits there's one that for the case of nelly sanders newborn christian you know she had accepted the lord she hadn't been baptized with the holy ghost but saved out of the world having a profession of faith how many saw you know in the chosen they pictured her mayor magdalene going back to to all her old haunts she said that disappointed me brother tim hey that's the way it is you say what do you mean she hadn't received the holy ghost yet and without the holy ghost and spirits can come take you over again pull you right back to the same old hump some people can live in a christian environment for 10 years and go right back in the same old homes again get filled with the spirit he is only cured for sin amen say well i accept the lord i believe the message brother tim hey that's only being able to read you know it's true you know it's right nellie sanders there you know i've made a profession of faith but then in a great battle kind of depicted from in a spiritual battle that's physically she's walking down to get some sewing goods to make a nice little decent holy dress that's what physically she's doing she's coming back and her ears here they're from the haunts of the old bars she hears the music and with that music demons are coming through watch what kind of music you listen to you say brother tim i like country and western you better get where you hate it well it depicts life in the real in the in this in this real manner not my life hey man sometimes i say you know they talk about playing these songs backwards they need to play the country music backwards man gets his wife back kids get their daddy back hey man the home is restored the drinking is gone the smoking the crows and everything else is gone play that music backwards one time hallelujah amen again you know again demons traveling now on this music comes reaching into your ears and you know you know i i i tell you what you know i'm i'm glad i'm a christian you know i just ain't the way i used to be praise god hallelujah that music don't bother me no more but you know i i you know i think i and here's the war and the devil tells her you know what you could just stop a minute here you know you're saved you're not going to go down there you know you when you you know what that life was you're never going to go back i'll tell you what just stop just a minute here and and listen you know you might be a witness to somebody they'll see you there and they'll they want to know about christ they'll see you in your holy dress and you know your unpainted face now and you know all of that and you'll be you'll be it can be a real testimony you're never a testimony on the devil's ground you shun the very appearance of evil not just evil what appears to be stay as far away as you can are you with me amen you can't play with the devil he'll get you i mean but anyway satan's telling her that music don't bother you no more you know you know you could stand right here for a minute and testify and he got her to stop just for a minute and i was staying on satan's ground just long enough and a demon took her and the next thing she was dancing in some guy's arm and she comes running to brother branham's now she looks the same on the outside she still got her long dress she's still got an unpainted face so tears are coming down brother bill brother bill brother bill i'm lost i'm lost knocking on his door sister what's the matter but inside had changed the inside had changed and a spirit brother branham saw as a hairy bat and wings like come out of her while he prayed now let me just tell you again demons are real spirits are real the holy ghost is real come on angels are real and if angels are real their counterparts demons are real if god is real the counterpart satan is real and we're in a battle now here we are you know there again it's an unseen realm but in this realm in this building right now there are evil spirits and there's war and there's christians that are anointed and the angels of god are encamped about them trying to energize them with faith and brother brandon said as i'm standing here the holy spirit is moving and this is what you call heavenly places in christ jesus and remember satan's already always skeptic at the sons of god you know he always does someone with a skeptic idea and when they do that satan is just trying to interfere so you got going on right in the church you have those who are skeptic and some are disbelieving and some are bored you know you bored them that you that you're going that's a satanic anointing get him away from you amen it's contagious come on amen fear is contagious every demon spirit is contagious somebody help me preach amen we are come to sit in heavenly places and in those heavenly places there are war the devil's going to warrant your mind he's always skeptical the sons of god someone with a skeptic idea trying to interfere now brother branham in his discernment he says i'm i there's that light he said it was taken there and examined by you know and it doesn't matter what you do you can take the examiners the question documents do all kinds of tests authenticate it it gets sent to washington and i've held the picture in my hand and people doubt it because you're not going to convince devils of unbelief as long as your heart's turned against god you're not going to believe god you won't believe the supernatural but the supernatural's got you anyway he looked and he said that light that's in that picture is hanging right over that woman because she's a believer she's my sister the spirit's witnessing back and forth he said now i know i'm talking to audience but actually my intellectual seemingly is in another world in a dimension another world and you said lady you've got a trouble and it's gross she's had an operation it's coming back gross on her chest that will finally kill the woman she's shadowed with death is that right wave your hand and there's a tumorous sort of thing is that right right here's another woman now he turns to another woman and this woman is sitting right here with the tumors somebody out in the congregation is that right lady if it is raise up your hand besides that you got to be diabetes also raise up your hand that spirit of darkness pulling across here them two demons are trying to catch one another calling for help but the power of god now above every doubt in here has rode over it do you believe that is god in his people you say god's in you brother branham not only me it's in her it's in her too and here's the holy spirit which is infallible there's the power of death in both of them and two deaths are trying to cooperate together while the power of god is revealing it and it's opening up and showing that he loves them women and he wants them to be healed hallelujah then he calls out and he says your name is miss moore going your rogue both of you had left both of you right there you're healed he saw the spirit leaf what you couldn't see it with the eye it was happening come on in the unseen realm but then people would testify yeah that's my name yes that's my problem yes that spirit's calling out to one the other and yes i got the same problem this woman's got it you're both healed because i saw it leave hallelujah now when now i understand church this is this is exactly where where we're at you know in in time let me just stop here you know there's also sinners who have never accepted christ brother branham said here's a woman she's praying for someone else a man a brother-in-law i believe that's right he's got stomach trouble and he's shadowed all over in darkness he's a sinner that's what he is he's a sinner now he saw the disease see he can't see the science can they can look in there and they can see the amoeba or whatever it is a germ or they got x-rays can see the growth i can pinpoint it right down to there and name waves at it and zip it and zap it but here's a prophet of god now he's looking into this realm of the supernatural the world i'm talking about the world that you as a christian has access to and he says he's shattered all over in darkness he's a sinner this person is sick but he's sicker than sick he's shadowed but he's got a darker shadow he's lost again this man is shattered for death you got a cancer you know that cancer is in the lung just a little while unless god helps that'll be it now he's he's good that he's good by me knowing that he's told me that he makes his word true doesn't it makes his word true i want to ask you something will you accept him as a personal savior now you're a sinner and you need him as your savior because a heavier darkness than cancer hangs over you and i want to get that shadow away from us now that brother branham hate that person because he was a sinner and saying oh you're shattered with death and then you've got a darker shadow and a more horrible shadow and you're a sinner no he loved him and when i'm telling you you're lost and you need jesus and you're shadowed i'm not condemning you i'm telling you there's hope there's mercy at the foot of the cross you don't have to live that way the rest of your life but if you just understand what's got a hold of you a heavier darkness and that cancer hangs over you and i want that shadow away from you will you accept him now as your savior raise your hand to him if you'll accept him you come from sacramento here is that right you believe god knows who you are mr keith go back home and get well you're saved from your death and may god be with you my brother what in one moment a dying man and then the next moment my brother you see what god can do in one moment by removing the shadow from your life in one moment turn you into a child of them i'm the most high god hallelujah hear you him brother branham said i'm a stranger to you something odd about you it's our first time meeting you're shattered for death it's a cancer in the stomach you're not from this city you're from a little place uh called like craba orchard tennessee here's the dark shadow you're not a christian you're a sinner we accept christ as your savior now raise your hand to him and tell him that you'll accept him then in jesus christ's name i condemn the cancer to death go and believe now and be baptized call in on the name of the lord that's right have faith don't come in the line unless you don't want your sins called out lest you confess them some ministers get to the man quickly the shadow has left him hallelujah amen the same god that knows where you're from amen from a little place i never heard of crab orchard tennessee a little place not from this city shattered with death cancer in the stomach but here's a darker shadow you're not a christian you're a sinner you say brother tim you're singling me out today because you you say well i don't believe exactly like you and you know i've done things that you you that you you say is just it's not according to the word and you're pointing me out i'm gonna point you out i'm gonna i'm gonna point you out i'm gonna point you out i'm gonna point you out i'm gonna point you out i'm gonna point me out let's look ephesians five and eight before you were sometimes darkness every one of us was in that shape you were sometime darkness amen but that's not our condition now but now but now you are light in the lord so walk as children of the light hallelujah you one time were in darkness you wear darkness but not now nothing satan not now devil not now i don't belong to you now i'm a child of the most high god and i operate as a son of god and i walk as a child of light hallelujah give me an ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 and i'm trying to close ephesians chapter two in verse one and you had to made alive how many has been made alive what made the light not here in that other realm i was dead i was born dead through the heavenly realm but now i'm alive in that heavenly realm watch now and i was dead in trespasses and sinned wherein in time past in my former life i walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the atmosphere that controlled my life there was a ruler that was over my life and i walked according to him the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience well i don't really agree with what the bible said i can do what i want to yeah disobedient children it's a spirit your problem is not what you've done your problem is a spirit amen you want we all though amen we all walked or had our conversation or the way we lived in time past in the lust of our flesh satan anointed our flesh and our lust and our desires fulfilling the desires of flesh and of the mind and we're by nature by our first nature sin nature ruling us the children around even as others i've been where you are but i'm telling you you don't have to remain that way but god hallelujah there's another equation there's another equation but god bless god but for god where would you be but for him where would you be but for him but god who is what rich and mercy rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us hallelujah even when we were dead in sin he had made us alive together with christ and it's by his favor his grace that he saved us and he has raised us up hallelujah we're not a part of the bollywood he raises us up and made us sit together in heavenly places in a position of authority and sonship in christ jesus stand to your feet and worship god hallelujah come on come on you're in church worshiping amen bring the musicians on hallelujah the anointing i'm under right now i'll preach unto midnight hallelujah amen but we are here as serpent bruisers and says satan defeaters we are here to overcome we are here to rise above you don't have to be ruled by the spirit of darkness anymore you can be saved to the light we are in a battle between the sons of eye light and the children of darkness [Music] will you back your head just for a moment [Music] you just bow your head just for a moment walk in on him just a minute [Music] you know you hadn't really surrendered your life to christ but today it's been told you there's another world well i don't believe in it what chuck your radio and television telephone your microwave it's another world we have been induced into another world and this message brings another world present say it's imagination well then what makes these men and women walk different talk different i could pick them out and call them by name men and women that was once darkness god turned their life around what changed them from darkness to life [Music] what changed that why why did the atmosphere change how come it took thieves and sex perverts and drunkards and dumpers and chains them in the
