[36:14] hour that you've anointed for this time
[36:17] to let us know Lord that you are light
[36:20] in the time of darkness when it gets so
[36:23] dark we can't see our hand in front of

[37:02] promise proclaiming it is the truth and
[37:05] it is our acre it is our anchor that
[37:09] holds within the veil Lord we pray in
[37:13] today now that you would bless us as we
[37:16] look in the world
[37:17] together at you and anoint us for this
[37:19] time and this purpose we believe that we
[37:24] are the anointed of this hour
[37:26] we believe the Bride of Christ is
[37:29] anointed to fulfill the New Testament
[37:32] even as you fulfilled the Old Testament
[37:34] in every type and never shadow to the
[37:37] scripture it is now being made manifest
[37:40] in this day in this hour in this time
[37:42] and we're asking for healing and
[37:44] deliverance for your children where else
[37:47] you know God the healing angel the Holy
[37:49] Spirit would just go through the land
[37:52] sweeping over every person every home
[37:56] Vince turn every place reassuring every
[38:00] life moving down into the ICU rooms and
[38:04] in the hospital
[38:05] Lourdes air or God in the in the little
[38:08] places where their families are gathered
[38:11] maybe their sickness there maybe the
[38:14] enemy has come in and tried to to put a
[38:17] death notice upon them but Lord may they
[38:21] know that today that there is an answer
[38:24] on the way that you are here appearing
[38:27] in our midst and you are the waymaker
[38:31] and you will do miracles for your healer
[38:35] I deliver our Savior my god her father
[38:42] her father you the source of our life
[38:45] today we position ourselves as a son of
[38:49] God we stand here with our shoulders
[38:53] squared back our head held high Lord the
[38:58] banner of the flag Oh God that is what
[39:01] we're sweeping and it's not a flag of
[39:03] surrender
[39:04] it is a flag of victory it is saying he
[39:07] is risen and because He is risen because
[39:11] he lives we live our self
[39:14] we're declaring the it is finished and
[39:17] the word is true and will stand upon
[39:20] that solid rock today as we look into
[39:24] your word blessing to our hearts we ask
[39:26] in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you
[39:31] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[39:34] today and wherever you're gathered today
[39:36] I hope that you have dedicated that for
[39:39] the house of the Lord for you where
[39:41] you're out just - I know I know it's um
[39:46] you know it's a little different but if
[39:48] you'll just get in the atmosphere of
[39:50] worship today and just to realize that
[39:53] the Lord is present with us little
[39:57] surprised that I would be here today and
[39:59] I want to thank brother Timothy for
[40:02] allowing me to minister today I don't
[40:05] say that really tongue-in-cheek I say
[40:07] that because he was prepared to speak
[40:09] and as I got up this morning I I just
[40:14] felt you know that I would just come and
[40:18] address you and speak to you today and
[40:20] especially to all our loved ones and
[40:24] friends everywhere around the world I
[40:26] want to thank you for your prayers as
[40:28] sister Karen continues to improve her
[40:32] eyesight is even better today her
[40:34] headaches are minimal and maybe that she
[40:37] can come home tomorrow
[40:38] if not today I'm still expecting a call
[40:41] from them two days as they just just
[40:43] come get her amen so we're just looking
[40:47] to the Lord for wonderful wonderful
[40:50] things that he is doing in her miss for
[40:53] those of you that don't know I guess it
[40:57] was Friday that I took sister Karen into
[40:59] the hospital they did a the cat scan
[41:02] because she was having some difficulties
[41:05] with with her eyesight they found that
[41:09] she's had another brain bleed in the
[41:11] same area that she had last time five
[41:14] years ago and you know that they can't
[41:20] explain why that it has happened they
[41:22] they just say is very rare for it to
[41:25] happen in the same place twice and
[41:27] so they call it idiopathic in that they
[41:30] don't know how to explain the phenomena
[41:33] that's going on I just call it an attack
[41:36] of the devil and so we know we are
[41:38] attacked by Satan but I know this when
[41:42] Joe heard all the news that he had
[41:44] received he fell on his face and worship
[41:47] God and I don't know what the devil's
[41:50] thinks what kind of response he's gonna
[41:52] get from us but he'll only get us to
[41:54] worship God amen because we will not we
[41:58] will not back down on a word of promise
[42:00] I want you to know as a church group I
[42:04] appreciate your prayers your love your
[42:05] support many texts the encouragement
[42:08] that we receive and my wife and I both
[42:12] appreciate that all the family I
[42:14] received from a brother from I think
[42:20] he's from South African and he wrote me
[42:24] a note and said I may just underscore
[42:28] that your ministry attracts a lot of
[42:31] trouble but man that attracts the Living
[42:34] God even lower and leaves us so
[42:36] encouraged so you know you know when you
[42:40] go to preaching faith and the promises
[42:43] of God and you start to proclaiming the
[42:45] truth of the word and that is for us
[42:47] today
[42:48] of course Satan he comes there and wants
[42:53] to attack and try to prove that wrong
[42:56] but I'll tell you it just attracts the
[42:59] Living God the even more a man and he
[43:02] causes us to have a more of a resolve a
[43:05] mountain and a moral reason to stand in
[43:08] the hour that we're at you know not
[43:11] pondered his statement and I found it
[43:14] very interesting that he said your
[43:16] ministry attracts a lot of trouble but
[43:19] because just yesterday brother Philip
[43:21] Roncalli um he asked me brother Tim what
[43:25] did you do to make the devil's a man and
[43:27] I said well I don't know for sure but if
[43:30] I knew I'd do it again
[43:33] a mountain so you know today as we say
[43:39] that the reason for it is because I know
[43:41] when the enemy comes in you know then
[43:45] like a flood the Spirit of God will
[43:47] raise up a standard against him
[43:49] you can't touch God's anointed this is a
[43:53] this is something that you must remember
[43:56] as the anointed of God because this is
[43:58] not just the preachers odious to
[43:59] preachers but it is to all of you touch
[44:04] not mine anointed do my prophets no harm
[44:06] but I rebuke Kings for their sake man
[44:11] and I know that Satan views itself as
[44:14] the god of this world but you know the
[44:18] Lord rebuke you Satan amen because
[44:21] you've touched God's anointed and that
[44:23] there was ever a time for faith you know
[44:28] I think it's now it's time to stand and
[44:30] believe you know the world around us
[44:33] today is is considering all the satanic
[44:38] attacks that has attacked all through
[44:41] the world they call it a virus but it's
[44:44] a demon that has gone through and then
[44:49] we hear of cancer attacks that are on
[44:52] the increase I've never heard of such a
[44:55] thing at such a time you know there
[44:58] there are attacks on the ministry that
[45:01] have been is you ever heard of brother
[45:03] Jewell who continues to recover today
[45:06] and the attack on brother Ron Spencer
[45:09] ingredients to them and their family who
[45:11] are listening in today and you know
[45:14] their little sister Shalom we have
[45:16] mentioned down in the Indian sister
[45:18] Cynthia Parker who's been 10 years
[45:20] without symptoms and now has reoccur and
[45:24] breast cancer the Massengale from their
[45:28] mom from there in Alabama who have
[45:31] pleaded with us to pray for them brother
[45:33] Nathan Bryant's mother
[45:35] minister there in in Jeffersonville area
[45:41] there that his mother's sister Dottie
[45:44] Bryant
[45:45] has has it just been found a cancer
[45:49] throughout and then brother Nathan
[45:52] bride's brother his brother Alan
[45:55] his mother-in-law - you know isn't this
[45:58] would be his mother and his
[46:00] mother-in-law also has has been stricken
[46:03] down with cancer and it's very very
[46:05] severe we hear of it happening you know
[46:09] where you know all over the country
[46:11] different ministers have wrote me on the
[46:14] behalf of their congregation and um but
[46:17] I want to remind the devil I want to
[46:20] remind the devil that cancer is one of
[46:22] the things that the angel of God
[46:26] specified nothing would stand before the
[46:29] believers prayer not even cancer and so
[46:34] we believe that today and we testify
[46:37] that it is the truth and we stand on
[46:40] that word of promise and I would like to
[46:44] turn to Hebrews 11 verse 1 and I would
[46:48] want to speak this morning on faith is
[46:51] the substance we're having just a little
[46:54] issues we have a storm here the other
[46:58] night and knocked out part of our
[47:00] equipment so some of some of our
[47:03] equipment is not working but that too
[47:06] will pass and Satan cannot stop us amen
[47:11] but the Word of God is true and we
[47:13] appreciate knowing that is is true
[47:16] Hebrews 11 and verse 1 now faith is the
[47:21] substance of things hoped for the
[47:24] evidence of things not seen for by it
[47:27] the elders obtained a good report and
[47:32] through faith we understand that the
[47:34] worlds were framed by the Word of God so
[47:39] that things which are seen were not made
[47:41] of things which do appear verse 6 but
[47:46] without faith it is impossible for to
[47:50] please him well he that cometh to God
[47:53] must believe that he is and that he is a
[47:56] rewarder of the
[47:57] that diligently seek Him amen
[48:02] gonna let you be seated if you will let
[48:06] me look at Isaiah 53 and verse 1 I don't
[48:09] have it in my notes but we're also going
[48:11] to refer to in in Romans here in a
[48:18] moment but isaiah 53:1 said who hath
[48:21] believed our report and to whom is the
[48:25] arm of the Lord revealed I wanted to
[48:27] stop for a moment and remind you that
[48:30] the armor of the lord or the arm of
[48:33] power is revealed to those who believe
[48:38] his report so bear that in mind as we're
[48:42] preaching today that if you want to see
[48:44] the arm of the lord or the hand of god
[48:47] working on your behalf then it will be
[48:51] revealed upon believing his report all
[48:57] right and of course it goes on we won't
[49:00] read it but you know it says he was
[49:02] wounded for your transgressions bruised
[49:04] for your iniquities and by His stripes
[49:06] you were healed and so and so again
[49:10] knowing this scripture is true that is
[49:13] the report he has been wounded for your
[49:16] transgressions
[49:17] he has been taken the weapons you
[49:20] deserved he has paid in full the price
[49:24] for your Redemption so that with the
[49:27] stripes that he took you were healed now
[49:31] Romans 10 16 and we'll use the the
[49:37] second portion of that which Paul is
[49:40] quoting as is for Isaiah said Lord who
[49:44] hath believed our report and then he
[49:48] says verse 17 so then faith cometh by
[49:51] hearing and hearing the Word of God so
[49:56] now we see this is all emphatically
[49:58] connected that faith comes by believing
[50:03] the report we hear God's report we
[50:06] believe that report when we hear it
[50:09] that's how faith comes we know that God
[50:12] cannot lie now of course we're in a
[50:16] great time of battle this is the endtime
[50:19] plan as I have been speaking it's a time
[50:23] that Michael shall stand up on the
[50:25] behalf of the children of thy people and
[50:28] there will be a great resurrection this
[50:29] is spoke to the Jews it is also at that
[50:32] very time in Revelation chapter 12 that
[50:35] that Michael um you know comes and wars
[50:39] against Lucifer and his angels and
[50:43] brother branham tells us that it's at
[50:46] that point in Revelation 12 that the
[50:48] bride goes up so it is in a great time
[50:52] of great trouble it is at a time of
[50:54] great battle and it is a time it is a
[50:58] time of battle that you can expect
[51:01] Michael to stand up on your behalf and
[51:05] upon the bride's behalf I preached the
[51:09] last time I was here was Easter Sunday
[51:11] and I'm ministered and and and as I
[51:15] ministered then I was telling you again
[51:18] about it's Easter his resurrection time
[51:21] it is time of course for Michael to
[51:25] stand up it's time that the angels
[51:27] return and I want you to remember this
[51:30] as we look into this we have had the
[51:34] angel of God in this day appeared to a
[51:38] prophet of God commissioned him tell him
[51:41] him he was to be a forerunner for the
[51:43] coming word or a message that and and
[51:47] that message is Christ and brother
[51:50] branham actually says this in spoken
[51:52] word is original seed he said that that
[51:56] is John the Baptist pointed to Jesus
[52:00] Christ the Lamb said behold the lamb of
[52:02] God so would this messenger do the same
[52:05] by by pointing to you know the word born
[52:10] bride and and so God is here manifests
[52:14] himself in in his word in this day and
[52:18] hour and we're in a very great battle
[52:21] and so as we look at this never be
[52:24] afraid or never be never think rather
[52:29] that you're not gonna have a battle we
[52:32] are in a battle and we're gonna have a
[52:34] battle and this battle will continue
[52:37] until we step out of this dimension into
[52:41] that heavenly dimension from this mortal
[52:44] into immortality now when when brother
[52:48] Branham said when even as he had the
[52:50] very filling of God's word in her hand
[52:52] she could have took the word but he said
[52:55] instead of tarry him for the baptism of
[52:58] the Holy Ghost she's let science prove
[53:01] to her that the Holy Ghost was only for
[53:03] the disciples and his tender keeping
[53:05] divine healing going when she ought to
[53:07] be now raising the dead and doing great
[53:10] miracles she's let Satan under his
[53:12] leadership of religious men take the
[53:14] Word of God and try to say is for
[53:16] another age and she's believed it and
[53:19] this has been happen and very subtly
[53:21] even in the message ranks because too
[53:24] often we are pointing back and you
[53:26] saying you know it was for another time
[53:29] it was when miracles were happening in
[53:33] science and that was only to vindicate
[53:35] the word and the word is more important
[53:38] than miracles let me tell you any time
[53:41] doctrine comes it must be accompanied by
[53:44] miracles Amen Jesus doctrine was
[53:48] different from that of the Pharisees and
[53:50] if we're gonna have anything different
[53:52] from that of denominationalism then
[53:55] we're gonna have to have a gospel that
[53:57] works and understand that you know Jesus
[54:01] doctrine was different in that Jesus
[54:04] doctrine um you know was was accompanied
[54:08] by signs and wonders and there was
[54:10] enough party that went with the word and
[54:13] and if this message does not have signs
[54:16] and wonders with it even today then it
[54:19] is just a worthless bunch of theology
[54:22] that will do nothing to change a life
[54:25] and so we don't want to turn it into a
[54:27] powerless group of people whose only
[54:30] weapon is argument
[54:33] give us a better argument than their
[54:35] ages before this is not a time for just
[54:39] having an argument we must have a life
[54:41] and some brother madam went on to say in
[54:44] this quote from God of this evil age
[54:46] that I was just reading he said when the
[54:48] Bible said the things that I do shall
[54:50] you do also jesus said go into all the
[54:53] world preach the gospel to every
[54:55] creature and we're still creatures and
[54:58] these signs will follow every one of
[55:00] them that believe and she denies every
[55:02] bit of it she denies all the
[55:04] supernatural and she swapped it for is
[55:06] intellectual conception of the Bible
[55:09] were priests and holy fathers and
[55:11] so-called we're bishops and archbishops
[55:15] and we're district respirators and
[55:16] gentle overseers and so forth has put
[55:20] their own interpretation there to it and
[55:22] God has left them sit there dead as 12
[55:26] o'clock now you know I just want to say
[55:32] that we though are people of faith our
[55:37] hearts have been turned back to fake
[55:40] that was the purpose of the message it
[55:43] was to initiate the coming of the Lord
[55:45] Jesus and of course it would come in and
[55:49] there would be phases of that coming as
[55:51] it would come from word a message of
[55:54] them from that message to flesh in a
[55:58] bride of people and get that people
[56:01] ready or they are manifesting that word
[56:03] a mature elect lady and then finally
[56:07] materialized into the literal return of
[56:10] Jesus Christ where we will meet him in
[56:12] the air now and so because of this we
[56:18] are people of faith we've heard some
[56:20] wonderful sermons of faith and
[56:23] encouragement that has been preached
[56:24] here oblate we've heard sermons from
[56:27] brother Joe Adams on he's able to do
[56:29] exceeding abundantly according to the
[56:32] power that works within you remember he
[56:35] can only do it according to the power
[56:37] that works within you the Holy Ghost is
[56:40] gonna be in the church it's gotta be in
[56:43] you Amen we've heard from brother
[56:45] Timothy no grace
[56:46] a great encouragement that we we have
[56:51] heard Wednesday night was of course
[56:53] another masterpiece that we heard and we
[56:56] also heard brother Haran sermons from
[56:59] last Sunday of hold the line you know
[57:02] and and just let me say it was more than
[57:05] any history lesson it was a great word
[57:07] just for us to hold our position in this
[57:12] hour but you know we must be in the
[57:15] right position because no army no
[57:19] general no matter how great the army is
[57:21] can hold a position unless it's the
[57:23] right position and so you know we we can
[57:28] have all the professions of faith but
[57:31] faith must find a position it's not as
[57:35] something that's aimlessly wandering
[57:38] around and and floating from here to
[57:41] there but it must have a resting place
[57:44] it must have a firm foundation and its
[57:49] position it must have its position on
[57:51] the Word of God let me tell you feelings
[57:55] will cave symptoms would change minute
[57:59] by minute but God's Word never changes a
[58:05] man and so brother Branham talked about
[58:08] the great contest that we are going
[58:11] through and said you know I want to
[58:12] speak quickly upon the greatest contest
[58:15] that there is between the church and
[58:17] Satan this great strength of Satan and
[58:21] we want to speak of the great strength
[58:24] of God in his church now this great
[58:29] contest has been going on for many years
[58:32] it started in heaven Satan was kicked
[58:35] out into the earth then he become the
[58:37] enemy of good an enemy of God's people
[58:40] since then he's used all his strength
[58:42] and his strategy to try to pull God's
[58:45] people across the fires into his fires
[58:48] and he said we and we know who
[58:52] as the most power God does and God when
[58:57] he gave his people the best thing he
[58:59] could compat Satan with was his word and
[59:04] now because the word is God and who is
[59:08] stronger than God so the word is God and
[59:13] the word becomes our strength God in the
[59:16] church becomes its strength on to pull
[59:21] Satan to his own fires that he has made
[59:24] how many would like to pull Satan into
[59:26] his own fires and man that's a very the
[59:30] very noose that he has made for us to
[59:33] hang us on amen that Haman will be hung
[59:36] on in all his children hey man so you
[59:40] know the strength to pull Satan into his
[59:43] own fires you know again that there's
[59:46] got to be a strength in the church to
[59:49] cast Satan down from that heavenly
[59:51] position where he tries to hold the
[59:55] believers at because he doesn't belong
[59:57] in the heavens but he's there because of
[1:00:00] man's fall and so because of man's fall
[1:00:04] that Adam subjected his self to to Satan
[1:00:07] and so Satan become the Prince of the
[1:00:09] power of the air and there he stands
[1:00:11] there in the heavenly places as the
[1:00:13] accuser of the Brethren trying to keep
[1:00:15] us out of God's word of promise and our
[1:00:19] position as believers but you see this
[1:00:22] is where the battle begins it's a battle
[1:00:26] for heavenly places and and so we we
[1:00:29] have been told
[1:00:30] all right you don't gird yourself put on
[1:00:33] the helmet of salvation put your your
[1:00:35] killer shoes own as brother Timothy
[1:00:37] preached one time and you shield of
[1:00:40] faith and your sword and get ready to
[1:00:42] fight because you're gonna have to fight
[1:00:45] for your position to hold your position
[1:00:49] and brother Aaron was preaching hold the
[1:00:51] line hold that position when you know
[1:00:54] your position when you know your calling
[1:00:56] when you know where you've been placed
[1:00:58] then you hold right there
[1:01:00] you don't move when circumstances change
[1:01:03] would set them sane when your feelings
[1:01:06] change
[1:01:07] amen the Word of God never changes so
[1:01:10] you hold your position in that word I am
[1:01:14] a believer and I am believing not in my
[1:01:17] feelings not in my symptom I am
[1:01:20] believing in what the Word of God said
[1:01:23] [Applause]
[1:01:27] so again the whole deal is now Satan is
[1:01:34] trying to pull us in his fire but it's
[1:01:38] your job to hold your position pull him
[1:01:44] into his own fire the very fall from
[1:01:49] heaven that takes place in Revelation 12
[1:01:53] because when he falls the bride goes up
[1:01:56] brother Branham tells us this third seal
[1:01:59] fourth seal second seal there's a number
[1:02:02] of places in the seals he says
[1:02:04] revelation 4:12 when the bride when the
[1:02:07] Satan has cast down the bride goes up so
[1:02:11] you see but what is he coming to the
[1:02:15] earth for he is coming to the earth to
[1:02:19] be played for the vials of judgment to
[1:02:25] be poured out unto him a man I mean he
[1:02:30] is coming to the earth for his kingdom
[1:02:33] to be destroyed hallelujah this is why
[1:02:38] he is falling he is falling so the wrath
[1:02:42] of God can be poured upon him while his
[1:02:45] pride has escaped the tribulation that
[1:02:48] is coming so you see it is the church
[1:02:55] God in the church becomes his strength
[1:02:57] to pull Satan into his own fires that
[1:03:00] he's made and to tuck those own and
[1:03:03] Jesus said in mark 16 and my name they
[1:03:07] shall cast out Devils and all two of
[1:03:09] them when it comes the Word of God the
[1:03:11] BIOS
[1:03:12] you know when it comes to the Word of
[1:03:14] God now listen closely when it comes to
[1:03:18] the Bible you become it seems sometimes
[1:03:22] really impersonal to us you know we we
[1:03:27] agree the Word of God is true how many
[1:03:31] believes that a man but it was written
[1:03:36] to someone else
[1:03:40] for example we read that the exploits of
[1:03:43] the faith of the patriarchs the Apostles
[1:03:47] and the prophets and we believe that
[1:03:50] every word spoken to them was as true as
[1:03:54] true as true can be and that was God
[1:03:59] dealing personally with them and we want
[1:04:05] God to speak personally to us and we
[1:04:10] longed out the same experience so that
[1:04:13] God can become personal to us and we
[1:04:18] would think it personal if God gave us
[1:04:21] the vision or we heard his voice and we
[1:04:25] believed that God was speaking directly
[1:04:28] and personal to us but now we're in most
[1:04:31] of time when we read the Bible we read
[1:04:33] it as if it's second-handed it is a
[1:04:38] wonderful and it's inspired a letter but
[1:04:41] it's written to somebody else in other
[1:04:45] words it was written to generation an
[1:04:48] age of nation or people or someone else
[1:04:52] it happened in another time in another
[1:04:54] place even we're very we're not careful
[1:04:58] we do the same thing with the message
[1:05:00] that God spoke to this generation and we
[1:05:04] apply it only to the Prophet how many
[1:05:08] times have I heard people scream out up
[1:05:11] it's his third bullet it was his third
[1:05:14] pull you know there's this is years and
[1:05:17] it's his and they don't realize that
[1:05:20] there Paul was he open and all those
[1:05:23] seals are revealing of the mysteries and
[1:05:25] it was a sword that was given in his to
[1:05:28] his hand but it was not for him alone it
[1:05:32] is for you and to your children I mind
[1:05:39] but now it's sometimes it seems like it
[1:05:45] is if God has spoken to a godly
[1:05:49] grandfather of ours and you know we we
[1:05:52] knew he worked walk circumspectly before
[1:05:55] God and and we readily accept that was
[1:06:02] God's Word to him God spoke to him and
[1:06:05] we would recount that and we would talk
[1:06:07] about it and talk reverently of it and
[1:06:10] believe it's to be the truth but it's
[1:06:13] not God's Word to us it's God's Word to
[1:06:16] him doc told my grandpa this God told my
[1:06:20] grandpa that you know and it's all true
[1:06:23] and what was said we agree it was good
[1:06:28] but it's sick and handed we relish in
[1:06:38] the truth that God spoke to our dear
[1:06:40] grandpa but it was his experience and
[1:06:44] there was God's Word and often this is
[1:06:49] how we read the Bible it's God's Word
[1:06:51] and we agree and we acknowledge that it
[1:06:54] is absolutely the truth we'll stand
[1:06:58] right here and say it's true from
[1:07:00] Genesis to Revelation is absolutely
[1:07:03] every word of God thus saith the Lord
[1:07:06] God spoke it and we give a mental assent
[1:07:13] to it that it is true but it's not
[1:07:18] personal it is a word that is spoken to
[1:07:24] someone else or to another generation a
[1:07:28] generation past we agree that the Bible
[1:07:34] is a revelation of
[1:07:36] that came from God like said we believe
[1:07:39] every word of it's the truth
[1:07:41] but when crisis comes it just don't work
[1:07:47] you know we simply are recognizing the
[1:07:53] truthfulness of what that marvelous book
[1:07:55] but we're not acting on it
[1:07:58] we're we recognizing God did that and we
[1:08:02] would my goodness women died for that
[1:08:06] yes sir I believe that but we're not
[1:08:10] acting on that because even though we're
[1:08:15] recognizing the truth of this marvelous
[1:08:18] word and how precious it is and God's
[1:08:22] hope and God revealed himself that God
[1:08:25] did this it was to them and on us now
[1:08:35] let me bring it down to you
[1:08:39] because there are many great wonderful
[1:08:43] grandfather's of this truth Abraham was
[1:08:47] Wonder it was one of them he was he was
[1:08:50] a wonderful grandfather of faith we call
[1:08:53] him the father of faith it's often
[1:08:56] referred to that we believe that God
[1:08:58] spoke to him and many believe that and
[1:09:01] man we enjoy reading about how God
[1:09:03] revealed himself to Abraham amen
[1:09:08] we enjoy recounting the stories which
[1:09:13] sometimes even react emotionally to it
[1:09:17] and yet it was God's Word Tabor him and
[1:09:24] we long for some revelation like Abraham
[1:09:30] had Sam dar was a person like most of us
[1:09:38] he dealt time after time with the pain
[1:09:42] of being robbed by intruders he agreed
[1:09:48] that God spoke
[1:09:50] to his forefathers he believed it with
[1:09:54] all his heart he was circumcised on the
[1:09:59] eighth day he was a full-fledged
[1:10:02] um israelite he was a person who had the
[1:10:07] Word of God that he could look back upon
[1:10:10] and day after day he waited and longed
[1:10:15] and prayed for God to speak to him as
[1:10:19] his boat to Abraham Isaac and Jacob oh
[1:10:24] god if you would just be to me God if
[1:10:28] you just revealed yourself to me and the
[1:10:33] Word of God to Abraham just younger it
[1:10:36] was true Shamgar believed it but it
[1:10:40] wasn't personal you know it was
[1:10:43] something spoken to Abraham for some
[1:10:47] guard it was a word of the past and was
[1:10:51] without life and was without power
[1:10:55] because it was the only secondhand a man
[1:11:02] he treated it with respect if he could
[1:11:06] have had a copy dummy in his tent or in
[1:11:08] his little Hut of his home he would have
[1:11:12] regarded that and held it close to his
[1:11:15] heart and believed it but it was a word
[1:11:19] of the it was a word for an age passed
[1:11:23] it was to Abraham but one day
[1:11:30] Shem Daria lized the word that was
[1:11:34] spoken Abraham was not only spoken a for
[1:11:38] him but to Abraham NEC and the word rang
[1:11:45] out to him and the word became personal
[1:11:50] he didn't see a vision he wasn't smitten
[1:11:54] on the head by an angel he didn't have a
[1:11:57] certain feeling
[1:12:00] hey ma'am a man all Oh what happened was
[1:12:04] is the word became personal to him and
[1:12:09] there was no longer Abraham's word alone
[1:12:13] but now he could see himself in it
[1:12:17] because he said unto Abraham and his
[1:12:20] seed thou shalt possess the case of
[1:12:24] thine enemy amen now that seed shall
[1:12:30] possess the gates of thine enemies he
[1:12:33] realized them that his seed of Abraham
[1:12:36] that the word was his personally and he
[1:12:44] did he went into action
[1:12:45] he didn't wait the moment he saw the
[1:12:48] word was not very BAM only but for him
[1:12:52] also and he took the position of being
[1:12:57] Abraham's seed now he always was Abraham
[1:13:00] seen but he had to take the position of
[1:13:05] being Abraham see and his by being
[1:13:08] Abraham's seed I am on the Covenant and
[1:13:13] because I am a covenant I with God
[1:13:16] I am the circumcised and a child of
[1:13:19] Abraham I have the right to the
[1:13:24] inheritance from him therefore that even
[1:13:29] me the case of my enemies I can possess
[1:13:32] it hallelujah Oh hallelujah if you can
[1:13:37] just take think of seeing in formalin he
[1:13:39] then took his ox code and he struck down
[1:13:42] 600 of his enemies why because the word
[1:13:47] the Bible became personal can I say to
[1:13:51] you the written word became personal it
[1:13:56] was no longer Abraham's word alone but
[1:13:59] now it was his word now this is what
[1:14:03] Joshua was dead he wasn't trying to take
[1:14:06] Moses place he wasn't Liz and standing
[1:14:09] there and say
[1:14:11] you know I'm and now I'm gonna take him
[1:14:13] Moses place I'm I'm now the great
[1:14:16] prophet he wasn't doing that he's just
[1:14:19] he you know let me just say today nobody
[1:14:22] can take the seventh angels place hey
[1:14:25] man we're but we should know the message
[1:14:29] wasn't for brother branham alone a man
[1:14:34] it is our message and we have been
[1:14:37] handed the king Seward a man we have
[1:14:41] been given a word a message and it's not
[1:14:45] for decoration but to use against the
[1:14:49] enemy now Galatians 3:29 let's look at
[1:14:56] this together if you will Galatians 3:29
[1:14:58] and if you be Christ's then you are
[1:15:03] Abraham's seed and heirs according to
[1:15:08] the promise so now if you are Christ
[1:15:14] having been born of Christ and man you
[1:15:17] belong to Jesus come on man you're
[1:15:20] tracing back your lineage right now
[1:15:22] you're looking right there then that
[1:15:25] means everything that was given to
[1:15:29] Abraham's seed is also given to you
[1:15:35] because if your Christ then you're
[1:15:38] Abraham's seed and you are heirs
[1:15:41] according to the promise the promise
[1:15:44] makes you an heir that means it makes
[1:15:49] the Word of God not grandpa's story but
[1:15:54] it makes God's Word your story it
[1:15:58] becomes your testimony
[1:16:01] it becomes God's Word to you
[1:16:08] so that means that the word spoken and
[1:16:12] given Abraham and his seed now belongs
[1:16:16] to us through Christ therefore any word
[1:16:21] that was given to the prophets and the
[1:16:24] apostles of old belong to us as the
[1:16:26] heirs of the promise ever word so now
[1:16:32] all of a sudden we've opened up a whole
[1:16:34] a whole book written personally you
[1:16:43] wanted something personal it is
[1:16:48] believers today you wanted something
[1:16:51] personal got such a message he has
[1:16:56] anointed you establish who he has called
[1:17:00] you he is for danger he has placed you
[1:17:03] for this hour and this time he gave you
[1:17:07] a message it is personal it must be
[1:17:11] personal so when he said these signs
[1:17:15] shall follow them that believe that's
[1:17:17] personal if he says the works that I do
[1:17:21] said you do also that's personal and
[1:17:27] this means that any word that is given
[1:17:32] to the apostles or prophets of old
[1:17:34] belong to us as the heirs of the promise
[1:17:37] and this means whether Jeremiah I say or
[1:17:42] Ezekiel or Matthew or mark or Luke or
[1:17:44] John or Paul or Peter whether it was a
[1:17:48] word that come to them and they spoke it
[1:17:51] it's as much mine as it was there
[1:17:59] for example we're going to read from the
[1:18:02] Bible speaking to Jeremiah and we think
[1:18:06] oh what a wonderful word it is jeremiah
[1:18:10] 29:10 but thus saith the lord that
[1:18:19] starting off pretty good ain't it we can
[1:18:22] we'll all agree now this is a word
[1:18:23] spoken by God it is the truth that after
[1:18:30] seventy years we accomplished that
[1:18:32] battlin I will visit you and perform my
[1:18:36] good words would you in causing you to
[1:18:38] return to this place for I know the
[1:18:41] thoughts that I think toward Jews said
[1:18:43] the Lord thoughts of peace and not of
[1:18:44] evil to give you and expect it in and
[1:18:47] then say you call upon me and you should
[1:18:49] go and pray to me and I will hearken
[1:18:51] unto you and you shall seek me and find
[1:18:53] me and when you shall search for me with
[1:18:56] all your heart and I will be found of
[1:19:00] you saith the Lord and I will turn away
[1:19:01] your captivity and I will gather you
[1:19:04] from all the nations and from all the
[1:19:06] places whether I have driven you said
[1:19:08] the Lord and I will bring you again and
[1:19:10] do the place where I caused you to be
[1:19:12] carried away captive
[1:19:16] how many would agree this is a wonderful
[1:19:19] word of God
[1:19:20] it is the word it is dust saith the Lord
[1:19:26] we agree that it is the truth a
[1:19:30] wonderful word from God but this word
[1:19:33] must be personal even though we mentally
[1:19:38] agree that it is a wonderful word we can
[1:19:42] look at it and we can say but it stays
[1:19:45] real they were down in Babylonian
[1:19:48] captivity they were down there and it
[1:19:51] was now seventy years God said I'll
[1:19:53] bring you out and now the time were you
[1:19:56] know was there and now you know it was
[1:19:59] all the this word that he was going to
[1:20:03] bring them back into their inheritance
[1:20:05] and back and
[1:20:06] their place and too often Christianity
[1:20:15] as a whole have put their finger on
[1:20:18] scriptures like that and they only have
[1:20:22] a historical significance there were
[1:20:28] great words of God and they were
[1:20:32] fulfilled and they move on and we look
[1:20:34] back well God give his word to them and
[1:20:37] and whatever and mentally agree we agree
[1:20:40] that it's a wonderful word god - indeed
[1:20:43] kept his word
[1:20:44] - the Israel and returned them back into
[1:20:47] their place in her homeland and yet for
[1:20:52] off to oven it's only history yet it's a
[1:20:56] wonderful history but it's of no real
[1:21:00] value until it becomes your word from
[1:21:04] God not just something that was only
[1:21:10] spoken to Israel now how can this happen
[1:21:13] then a word that has spoken to a
[1:21:15] generation past can be for me today
[1:21:17] house as possible
[1:21:19] it comes back recognizing if we are
[1:21:22] Christ then we are Abraham's seed and we
[1:21:26] are also heirs according to the promise
[1:21:31] so that when we read this scripture that
[1:21:35] we we position ourselves in Christ
[1:21:40] recognizing ourselves as seed his seed
[1:21:44] by the new birth a man and the and as
[1:21:49] the seed of Christ the word that was
[1:21:51] spoken to Abraham's natural seed applies
[1:21:54] now even more to you than it did to them
[1:22:03] now why is that why would it mean more
[1:22:07] look like to me the first application
[1:22:09] would mean the most it because the first
[1:22:12] application was only for shadow
[1:22:14] and typing and speaking of another
[1:22:18] generation to come to whom this work
[1:22:22] would be real to and so they're only
[1:22:26] acting out in type what is going to be
[1:22:29] done from when it moves from negative to
[1:22:32] positive
[1:22:34] hallelujah
[1:22:35] a man omame this would be a moment today
[1:22:39] of realization to you so suddenly it is
[1:22:42] quicken to you as a personal word from
[1:22:45] God a man that the word becomes
[1:22:49] something that is not only written to a
[1:22:52] generation of some thousands of years
[1:22:55] ago but a revelation of the wheel and
[1:22:58] the purpose of God to you a man what
[1:23:02] does he say I will visit you well I'll
[1:23:05] tell you if I were you this morning I
[1:23:07] get ready for visitation hallelujah
[1:23:12] Healing has been pronounced over you
[1:23:15] deliverance has been past but pronounced
[1:23:18] overview a rapture has been pronounced
[1:23:21] overview look to two women that came to
[1:23:24] brother branham's meeting and their and
[1:23:26] their
[1:23:27] David they were they were told you know
[1:23:29] what the problem was one had a quarter
[1:23:31] the other the other had a stomach issue
[1:23:35] and the end so they they they were told
[1:23:39] you know you know go eat your supper you
[1:23:42] know go go go your way you know goddess
[1:23:45] God has healed you now many times people
[1:23:49] look at that and they say well if he
[1:23:51] didn't happen immediately God didn't do
[1:23:53] it let me tell you it already happened
[1:23:55] before the vision the vision only was
[1:23:59] telling what Christ did at Calvary a man
[1:24:03] because way back then he was wounded for
[1:24:06] your transgressions he was bruised for
[1:24:09] your iniquities
[1:24:10] all may this be a personal word to you
[1:24:13] today I mean this is not just a
[1:24:16] historical a recount of what happened to
[1:24:19] Jesus in
[1:24:21] is your lamb it is your sacrifice it is
[1:24:24] your provision it is your Redemption now
[1:24:33] he said I will perform I will visit you
[1:24:38] now these women they went home they felt
[1:24:42] no different things was no different but
[1:24:45] the word had been spoken a man the
[1:24:49] symptoms didn't get better
[1:24:51] in fact they got even worse but they
[1:24:56] kept testified but that man never knew
[1:25:00] me that was a that he told me what my
[1:25:04] condition was he told me what my name
[1:25:07] was and and where I lived and all these
[1:25:10] other things and I know it was the truth
[1:25:13] and then some would say what would say
[1:25:16] to them but you don't just give up on it
[1:25:18] you know it's a he you just got worked
[1:25:21] up on me and on it it's not gonna happen
[1:25:24] here
[1:25:24] you're even bringing a disgrace on the
[1:25:27] name of Christ and they stood right
[1:25:30] there firm and he said it was several
[1:25:34] weeks later said the angel of God was
[1:25:38] passing by the neighborhood and the
[1:25:42] woman got up in the morning and she she
[1:25:45] began to eat her her the leftover
[1:25:49] toasted and oatmeal from that her
[1:25:52] children she made for children and that
[1:25:54] would just burn her stomach but she you
[1:25:58] just kind of felt hungry and she just
[1:26:00] you know grab bits of Gladys healed me
[1:26:03] and I'm taking him at his word and she
[1:26:06] just began to eat and her best uh McNair
[1:26:09] burned st. more and it never burned
[1:26:12] she ain't more and never burned so he's
[1:26:16] got all excited when to running over to
[1:26:18] her neighbor's house and and she gives
[1:26:20] over there and she's up shaking the
[1:26:23] sheets and everywhere because the the
[1:26:25] Gorter tumor had left her body and she
[1:26:28] was healed and brother enzert what was
[1:26:30] it the angel of
[1:26:32] Claude was passing through the
[1:26:34] neighborhood I meant why because
[1:26:38] somebody refused to give up on the world
[1:26:40] of Claude hallelujah and the angel when
[1:26:45] he came by he found them still believing
[1:26:48] I want you today I want that to be your

[1:32:55] to see what brother branham said about
[1:32:57] plagues they're looking to see what
[1:32:59] brother famine said about trouble I'm
[1:33:02] not looking in the air to see what
[1:33:03] brother Bantam said about plants I'm
[1:33:06] escaping the tribulation I know it's a
[1:33:11] Feast of the trumpet it was it was

[1:33:25] and flu and other pandemics of the past
[1:33:30] that's not what I'm looking a message
[1:33:32] I'm looking for the appearing of the
[1:33:35] angel of the Lord a man I'm looking for
[1:33:39] his presence of him performing my good
[1:33:42] work toward you in causing you to return

[1:38:05] the church left when you enter wondering
[1:38:09] as it was in the tent in the Indus in
[1:38:13] the ages like wandering in the
[1:38:15] wilderness for I know the thoughts that
[1:38:19] I think toward you saith the Lord
[1:38:24] don't get nervous don't get afraid of

[1:39:01] tell you according to this word this
[1:39:03] morning God's listening like he never
[1:39:05] has if you look at the Seventh Seal when
[1:39:11] the Seventh Seal is up and breaking the
[1:39:13] silence what happened to prayers the
[1:39:16] incense is poured out upon the altar
[1:39:18] which are the prayers of the same and
[1:39:20] they are accepted before God this is not
[1:39:26] a time where God is not hearing prayers
[1:39:29] this is a time where God has now
[1:39:32] receiving those fares can I say things
[1:39:39] that have been on hold for a long time
[1:39:41] children that have been straying a long
[1:39:44] time a man those that have been sick a
[1:39:49] long time
[1:39:50] those have been discouraged a long time
[1:39:54] but you see it's no longer at the time
[1:39:58] of holding it back it's the time of
[1:40:00] answering Amen were the prayers of his
[1:40:04] coming and the fulfilling of his word
[1:40:06] and putting the bride back in her
[1:40:08] position so she can take a rapture is

[1:41:37] gathering together it's not about who
[1:41:41] has the biggest Church and the message
[1:41:44] it ain't about having the most members
[1:41:51] about having those who shout the most

[1:44:17] said I will turn away your captivity and
[1:44:22] I will gather you from all the nations
[1:44:25] and from all the places where I've
[1:44:27] driven you saith the Lord and I will

[1:45:40] of you do for a closer what would God
[1:45:42] what are you asking to be positioned in
[1:45:45] favor today this is not just a word to
[1:45:52] the Jewish people of 2000 or 2500 years

[1:46:03] even more true to you and I'm far

[1:46:09] the reality that is revealed to you

[1:50:38] listen listen let me try to get some of
[1:50:40] this and and as always I'm starting to
[1:50:44] run out of time but listen then let me
[1:50:46] tell you he's God and His Word are
[1:50:48] inseparable
[1:50:48] I meant God in His ways his word and his
[1:50:52] word is God this is God in print form
[1:50:55] this is the voice of God the imprint for
[1:50:57] and if I can get it is not just a voice
[1:50:59] to God to another generation it's God's
[1:51:01] voice to you it's your letter I've
[1:51:09] assured you I'm Debbie here and I did it
[1:51:11] there and I didn't hear and I did it
[1:51:13] there and I was only showing you what
[1:51:14] I'm doing now I rolled away the stone
[1:51:20] and there was a resurrected Christ then
[1:51:22] there's gonna be an anointed one in this
[1:51:24] last day also a resurrected people and
[1:51:29] the angel is said of the stone to make
[1:51:32] sure that nobody ever puts the stone
[1:51:34] back home because you're not gonna seal
[1:51:37] this bride away and sub denominational
[1:51:39] tomb and ISM a man in unbelief again no
[1:51:43] sir
[1:51:44] a woman of faith she's called the faith
[1:51:47] woman God's written word is no less than
[1:51:54] God himself
[1:51:55] I'm a captive aid this nor capitalize on
[1:51:58] this again but brother Branham says in
[1:52:01] the infallible Word of God he said you
[1:52:02] can't rest your faith as I say upon just
[1:52:06] anything you've got to have some basic
[1:52:09] fact and the reason I rest my faith upon
[1:52:11] this word is because I believe it to be
[1:52:13] the Word of God and then if it's God if
[1:52:17] it is the Word of God it is God himself
[1:52:21] in Word form hold up your Bible right
[1:52:24] now and I want you to say this is the
[1:52:29] Word of God and it is God himself in
[1:52:33] Word form it is just as powerful and has
[1:52:41] just as much life in it as when it wrote
[1:52:45] of his lips if it was 2,000 years ago or
[1:52:50] 10 million years ago his word still
[1:52:54] holds the stars in place though it was
[1:53:00] spoke in the beginning that said let
[1:53:02] there be and it's that word has held
[1:53:05] them and is just as powerful today as it
[1:53:09] was then
[1:53:10] it hasn't changed and that word today is
[1:53:16] still right over you it's just as
[1:53:20] powerful today as it was then he said
[1:53:22] and then if that is God himself and no
[1:53:25] man is any better than his word all
[1:53:28] right should declaration here that's
[1:53:30] something that I'll do now I'm no better
[1:53:32] than my word then that word is and the
[1:53:35] word is part of me it's my word and if
[1:53:38] this is God's wicked written word it can
[1:53:40] be no less than God himself because he's
[1:53:44] obligated to his word hey man now I you
[1:53:53] know we we're just gonna go from that
[1:53:55] because I
[1:53:56] and I'm gonna skip down because we're
[1:53:58] just running out of time now but I want
[1:54:01] to remind you when the angel of God came
[1:54:04] to Mary and spoke about the forerunner
[1:54:08] coming which was John who would be born
[1:54:11] of her cousin Elizabeth and he said you
[1:54:15] know he said here when he told her that
[1:54:18] said nothing for with God nothing shall
[1:54:22] be impossible so I want you to know
[1:54:26] there is a word attached to the message
[1:54:30] of the forerunner and that is with God
[1:54:35] nothing shall be impossible now with
[1:54:40] with Elizabeth she was past childbearing
[1:54:42] and man it was impossible as far as men
[1:54:45] was concerned and then with Israel she
[1:54:49] was a barren woman too to bring forth
[1:54:51] the Messiah and she look like what never
[1:54:53] happened a man we were looking out today
[1:54:57] and we see a church that has been barren
[1:55:00] looking for the coming of the Lord for
[1:55:02] 2,000 years for the promised son to
[1:55:04] appear but I want to remind you with God
[1:55:07] nothing shall be impossible and this is
[1:55:11] the word that is spoken when he sends a
[1:55:15] forerunner I'm gonna stablish you back
[1:55:19] on the word because with God nothing
[1:55:22] shall be impossible
[1:55:24] let me read another translation not one
[1:55:28] promise from God is empty of power for
[1:55:34] nothing is impossible with God let me
[1:55:36] read that again
[1:55:37] not one promise from God is simply a
[1:55:40] power that devil
[1:55:45] hey man we got a whole word we got a
[1:55:47] whole arsenal full hey man we've got
[1:55:50] every precious promise that makes us for
[1:55:53] takers of His divine nature hallelujah
[1:55:57] and not one promise of God is empty of
[1:56:01] power for nothing is impossible with God
[1:56:08] another version says for no word of God
[1:56:10] shall be void of power the amplified
[1:56:14] says for with God nothing is or ever
[1:56:17] shall be impossible again then another
[1:56:22] amplified version says the complete
[1:56:25] version said for with God nothing is
[1:56:27] ever impossible in no word from God
[1:56:29] shall be without power or impossible of
[1:56:33] fulfillment now God is honest
[1:56:39] come o a man God his honest guns will to
[1:56:43] keep his word amen the Bible said that
[1:56:46] he is not a man this is number 23 29
[1:56:50] 1923 19 numbers 23:19
[1:56:53] God is not a man that he said laughs
[1:56:57] neither the son of man that he should
[1:56:59] repent but he has said shall he not do
[1:57:05] it or hath he spoken it and the salad
[1:57:08] not be made good so here again if God
[1:57:12] said it and man if he spoken it what'd
[1:57:15] he make it good cuz he's not a man then
[1:57:19] he has to repent he doesn't put it out
[1:57:23] and say oh well circumstances change so
[1:57:25] now it's not gonna happen when God says
[1:57:27] it it's gonna happen
[1:57:29] hey man he is not a man that he should
[1:57:33] lie when he says something it's going to
[1:57:36] happen hey man again it says in 1st
[1:57:40] Kings 8:56 there's not one word one word
[1:57:45] there's not failed one word
[1:57:48] of all his good promise somebody with me
[1:57:54] hey man there has not failed one word of
[1:57:59] all his good promise it says some sums
[1:58:06] one eighty eight eighty nine forever Oh
[1:58:09] Lord your word is settled in heaven
[1:58:12] brother Brandon would say we argue about
[1:58:14] it here but up there it's settled a man
[1:58:18] he says I will hasten my word to perform
[1:58:22] it and that word hasten means to watch
[1:58:25] over to look after to protect to stand
[1:58:29] behind a man in all his unlimited power
[1:58:33] God is standing behind his word to
[1:58:36] accomplish it do you believe that you
[1:58:40] must confess that there is no reason to
[1:58:43] doubt God hallelujah I want you to look
[1:58:48] at your circumstance right now and say I
[1:58:52] got reason to doubt that circumstance
[1:58:54] but I have no reason to doubt God not
[1:58:58] one word of his promise ever failed if
[1:59:02] that Bosworth said don't doubt God if
[1:59:05] you must doubt something doubt your
[1:59:06] doubts because they're unreliable but
[1:59:10] never doubt God or his word a man I
[1:59:15] think that's good instructions today DL
[1:59:17] moody said if there's any reason why is
[1:59:20] there any reason why you should not have
[1:59:22] faith in God has God ever broke one of
[1:59:25] his promises his I defy any infidel or
[1:59:29] unbeliever to place a finger on a single
[1:59:32] promise God ever made and failed to
[1:59:34] fulfill Satan is a liar I mean Jesus
[1:59:40] said so and I can open my Bible right
[1:59:42] now and show you out for 6,000 years
[1:59:45] Satan has lie
[1:59:48] to God's people circumstances always
[1:59:52] lied symptoms lied come on oh yeah Satan
[2:00:00] has lied but God has never lied
[2:00:07] the devil is denied God's promise and
[2:00:15] Hilda him you promise you anything but
[2:00:19] the devil had never kept any of his
[2:00:21] promises
[2:00:24] amen that's why we need to determine
[2:00:26] whatever Jesus told us to do as his
[2:00:29] followers we're gonna do it whatever he
[2:00:33] said we he would do we should expect him
[2:00:36] to do it cuz he never lies
[2:00:39] we should act upon his written word just
[2:00:42] as the prophets of God acted upon his
[2:00:44] spoken word in the Bible hey man we
[2:00:48] should do like the disciples did of our
[2:00:50] Lord if he said we could heal the sick
[2:00:53] we should expect the sick to be healed
[2:00:55] if he said we can cast out devils we
[2:00:59] should do it in his name and expect the
[2:01:01] devil to obey us we find that true hey
[2:01:05] man we remember you scam what was it
[2:01:08] over 10 domani demonstrations of the
[2:01:11] devil and everyone am I to bow to the
[2:01:14] name of Jesus Christ I want to say it's
[2:01:18] wonderful to have a gospel that works
[2:01:22] we every witnessed the restoring of the
[2:01:25] sight to the blind would God heal my
[2:01:28] wife and restore her sight and I'll just
[2:01:31] tell you he'll do it again
[2:01:33] [Applause]
[2:01:37] you say brother Jim then the healing
[2:01:40] didn't last we had a victory for five
[2:01:43] years a man what do you think it doesn't
[2:01:47] laughs we've had five years of victory
[2:01:48] and you know Israel without victory and
[2:01:52] being their promised land and they would
[2:01:55] have feet the Philistines and here few
[2:01:57] years later here they come back again
[2:01:59] and invade again can you say what that
[2:02:02] was in the victory no you can't say that
[2:02:05] wasn't a victory no that was a victory I
[2:02:10] met but now we are faced with another
[2:02:13] crisis and there's another victory
[2:02:18] hallelujah and we'll draw strength from
[2:02:21] this victory I've gotta do it again
[2:02:25] because nothing to our God
[2:02:28] he's the resurrection and the life who
[2:02:32] you were dead yet shall he live
[2:02:37] hallelujah we witness the healing of the
[2:02:44] crippled will little drew walked we
[2:02:48] witnessed the sick and diseased when
[2:02:51] brother Gary stinking laying there at
[2:02:54] the point of death demons been howling
[2:02:57] at him screaming at him distressing him
[2:03:00] who he went in there with a purpose why
[2:03:06] there's churches Milt it's a memorial
[2:03:09] that God heals it was built on the fact
[2:03:15] that God heals that day in that room God
[2:03:20] gave us a mandate it was some miracle
[2:03:23] after miracle after miracle of God's
[2:03:26] provision
[2:03:31] Alleluia so what if you never use it
[2:03:34] again
[2:03:35] what difference does that make he'll
[2:03:37] stand as a star testimony that God is a
[2:03:42] provider because I have you to know when
[2:03:48] the rapture takes place
[2:03:49] I hope it's mostly empty don't any of
[2:03:55] you show up here show up there when
[2:04:01] little judo goes be was healed when
[2:04:04] Mariah Pruett when Atlanta butts was
[2:04:07] healed and we can rejoice today in the
[2:04:12] truth of Jesus word all things are
[2:04:15] possible to them that believe they shall
[2:04:21] lay hands on the sick everywhere in the
[2:04:25] gospel in the book of Acts believers
[2:04:27] laid hands on the sick but you know what
[2:04:31] we've done this we in the message we
[2:04:34] have started putting too much and I even
[2:04:37] hear him today I heard a group of
[2:04:39] ministers and God bless them and
[2:04:40] brothers if you hear this I don't mean
[2:04:44] to criticize you I don't even know these
[2:04:46] brothers but they somebody sent me a
[2:04:50] link and they they said well you know
[2:04:54] you know what we need is not not the
[2:04:59] Holy Ghost we don't need that what we
[2:05:02] need is we need more teaching and I said
[2:05:07] more teaching we gotta have more
[2:05:10] mechanics what more teaching
[2:05:14] do we need we got 1100 tapes of teaching
[2:05:19] we made the illusions out of all the
[2:05:22] preachers when study didn't quoted it
[2:05:27] back and forth and back and forth and
[2:05:30] back and forth we've got the mechanics
[2:05:34] brother branham said it back there and
[2:05:36] he said we
[2:05:37] too much stress on the mechanics and
[2:05:40] nothing on the dynamics Smith
[2:05:48] Wigglesworth David Dexter
[2:05:50] shared this quotation some of you may
[2:05:54] have read it already but there was once
[2:05:55] a boat in the mouth of the Amazon River
[2:05:59] the people on board thought they were
[2:06:01] still in the ocean they were dying of
[2:06:05] thirst and some of them were nearly mad
[2:06:08] they saw his shift and they asked him we
[2:06:12] just give us some water someone in the
[2:06:15] ship said just dip your bucket right
[2:06:17] over your in the mouth of the river
[2:06:24] hallelujah anyone ought to say there are
[2:06:27] a number of people today in the middle
[2:06:30] of the river of life but they're dying
[2:06:32] of thirst cuz they do not dip down and
[2:06:34] take from the river and dear friend you
[2:06:37] may up the word but you need an awakened
[2:06:40] spirit the word is not alive until it's
[2:06:44] moved upon by the Spirit of God in the
[2:06:46] right sense and it becomes spirit in
[2:06:48] life when it's touched by his hand alone
[2:06:52] so we need to say God awaken my spirit
[2:06:55] to the truth of the word where I dip
[2:06:58] into it and drink I have been starving
[2:07:03] for visitation I've sent your message
[2:07:10] got your whole Bible I will visit you
[2:07:16] I'll return you to this place a place
[2:07:20] where the written word becomes real
[2:07:22] where the written word becomes yours
[2:07:26] where it becomes personal are you with
[2:07:30] me amen
[2:07:32] you know again I you know it's time we
[2:07:35] dip down into the river of God's
[2:07:38] blessings and start drinking we're not
[2:07:43] out on the sea when I didn't babbling
[2:07:45] what about a trip to the
[2:07:47] that there we have returned to the land
[2:07:49] and that waters the rivers of milk and
[2:07:53] honey now as I try to bring this down to
[2:08:00] close I'm gonna I'm just going to bring
[2:08:03] it bring it down to you just for a
[2:08:05] moment when you as the sick learn to
[2:08:14] base your faith on the Word of God
[2:08:16] exclusively that's when you will have
[2:08:19] luck won the victory too many times
[2:08:24] people are waiting for a special moment
[2:08:27] a special prayer line a special touch a
[2:08:29] special treat and that's where their
[2:08:34] faith is laying and if it doesn't happen
[2:08:36] under that preacher they find of someone
[2:08:38] that maybe has a little more faith or it
[2:08:41] preaches a little more dynamic or
[2:08:43] somebody that has a few more miracles
[2:08:45] and hope that in his line they'll get it
[2:08:48] I want to go back and bring this to a
[2:08:54] close and will be out by 1:30 but you
[2:08:58] remember sister Lana's healing of cancer
[2:09:01] God quick in the scripture to me I
[2:09:04] didn't write her over a day I didn't I
[2:09:07] didn't write her very often really I
[2:09:08] just tried to give her a word of
[2:09:10] encouragement when I felt like it but
[2:09:12] God inspired the scripture to me one
[2:09:14] morning and I sent it to her with these
[2:09:17] words I said you're continually in our
[2:09:20] prayers daily in through the night yeah
[2:09:25] and that's true even this morning and
[2:09:30] for the last few mornings I've been up
[2:09:32] at 3:00 in the morning talking it over
[2:09:35] with him talking him about you your
[2:09:39] needs your situation you that are sick
[2:09:45] he said I would seek Him and I would
[2:09:49] find him
[2:09:54] and I said there's not a day that we
[2:09:56] neglect to pray for you so that your
[2:10:00] faith be lifted so that the healing
[2:10:03] names of the Holy Ghost can sweep over
[2:10:05] you with his healing touch responding to
[2:10:08] your faith we know faith is a gift of
[2:10:13] God that each of us possess it is his
[2:10:15] faith we are rising to the occasion with
[2:10:19] you and God is not on your side you are
[2:10:25] on his side and the battle is not ours
[2:10:29] it is the Lord's and IRA and ice in our
[2:10:33] second Chronicles 2015 and he said
[2:10:37] hearken ye all Judah you inhabitants of
[2:10:41] Jerusalem and thou King Jehoshaphat thus
[2:10:45] saith the Lord unto you be not afraid
[2:10:49] nor dismayed by the reason of this great
[2:10:51] multitude for the battle is not yours
[2:10:54] but gods and this became a double
[2:11:00] witness my sister Mary Katharine mälar
[2:11:03] the same scripture to come to her home
[2:11:05] on that same day and sister Lana took
[2:11:08] that scripture that was written there
[2:11:12] great-great-great great-great
[2:11:13] great-grandfather Jehoshaphat a man that
[2:11:20] she will always say yeah it's true and
[2:11:22] that's right and yea God did that and
[2:11:24] God answered and God did and got that
[2:11:26] but that day it became personal the
[2:11:31] written word the written word became
[2:11:35] alive to her she began to accept that
[2:11:39] her as her own and said Lord if the
[2:11:43] battle is not mine but yours then you're
[2:11:46] gonna have to do something supernatural
[2:11:51] and she began to expect for something
[2:11:54] supernatural that day sitting right back
[2:11:58] there in the mezzanine as I preached on
[2:12:00] the revealing of sons over that February
[2:12:03] 18th 2008 I 18 I think I was preaching
[2:12:09] the Bible days are here again now listen
[2:12:13] what was it why would we preach it wise
[2:12:17] brother Timothy been preaching what he's
[2:12:19] preaching brilliant chill preach brother
[2:12:21] Aaron preach why are we preaching the
[2:12:23] way we're preaching because we're in a
[2:12:27] crisis and I'm not just talking about
[2:12:30] Cohen 19 we've been in a crisis before
[2:12:33] then I mean even in your home even in
[2:12:38] your family you may be in a crisis right
[2:12:43] now in that home I'm in a crisis so why
[2:12:48] not preach like I'm preaching because
[2:12:50] because in the crisis I'm looking for
[2:12:55] the angel I know the crisis is here
[2:12:59] don't tell me about the crisis and how
[2:13:01] bad the crisis and how impossible it
[2:13:03] look I'm looking there to see the angel
[2:13:07] I'm looking at there to see him I know
[2:13:10] the scripture make it alive I was
[2:13:17] preaching the Bible days are here again
[2:13:19] that we had a Bible Jesus doing Bible
[2:13:23] signs and Bible wonders and Bible works
[2:13:26] and that God was doing extreme things
[2:13:28] and I want to give you a word again this
[2:13:32] morning God is doing some extreme things
[2:13:35] [Music]
[2:13:36] shall i prophesy it God is doing extreme
[2:13:42] things right now
[2:13:44] I speak that in his name we began to
[2:14:02] worship God we made getting the same
[2:14:05] glory to his name what have I to dread
[2:14:10] what have I to fear leaning on the
[2:14:13] everlasting arms and as we did the word
[2:14:20] that was spoke to her went into action
[2:14:25] put it back second Chronicles 2015 thus
[2:14:30] saith the Lord to you the man who aren't
[2:14:34] ready to take thus saith the Lord to you
[2:14:36] this morning can it be something more
[2:14:41] than 10 your great-great-great
[2:14:42] great-great-great great-great-great
[2:14:44] great-grandfather a nice word spoke to
[2:14:46] him and and it worked back there can it
[2:14:48] not be personal to you today that saith
[2:14:50] the Lord
[2:14:52] have you ever seen that st. the Lord
[2:14:55] ever fail be not afraid nor dismayed by
[2:15:03] reason of this great multitude don't be
[2:15:10] afraid and we begin to sing what if I
[2:15:13] could read what have I to fear I am
[2:15:21] blessed peace with my lord so near and
[2:15:25] women and hear these very words maybe
[2:15:30] she didn't think of them at the moment
[2:15:32] but this was her scripture that it come
[2:15:35] alive to her that God's gonna do
[2:15:37] something supernatural I'm Allan in that
[2:15:41] moment there in that very supernatural
[2:15:44] moment you know where she heard of
[2:15:48] Bible that works a Bible day a Bible God
[2:15:52] a Bible in action hey man oh she began
[2:15:57] to hear those three things now echoed in
[2:16:00] a song you know that that we're saying
[2:16:03] here don't be afraid be not afraid nor
[2:16:06] dismayed by the reason of the multitude
[2:16:09] of all the doctors reports by the
[2:16:13] multitude of your symptoms by how you
[2:16:16] feel today by the circumstances around
[2:16:20] you what have I to dread what have I
[2:16:25] have here I have blessed peace with my
[2:16:31] lord so near and it that she jumped up
[2:16:35] and put her faith into action
[2:16:37] hey man and she ran twice around that
[2:16:40] building you know you saw it a lot of
[2:16:44] people that son didn't know what it even
[2:16:46] meant can't believe it but there were
[2:16:49] people here that day that is just you
[2:16:52] know that just turned and went away
[2:16:54] after seeing it all happen and that's
[2:16:57] what Jesus said some will not believe
[2:16:59] that one raised from the dead
[2:17:03] but anyway nevertheless she took that as
[2:17:06] her own and it became quicken to her be
[2:17:09] not dismayed by the reason of this
[2:17:12] multitude and I want to say don't be
[2:17:15] afraid don't be dismayed at all what the
[2:17:18] doctor says oh how you're feeling today
[2:17:27] we've had a multitude of bad news she
[2:17:32] had a multitude of bad news she didn't
[2:17:35] have no good news she was getting weaker
[2:17:38] by the day thinner by the day come on
[2:17:43] but she had heard the battle is not
[2:17:45] yours but gods a man and she jumped up
[2:17:51] from there and acted on it and ran
[2:17:54] around this and when showing the devil I
[2:17:57] have nothing to fear I have nothing to
[2:17:59] dread and she proclaimed her healing
[2:18:04] right there a man right there is and she
[2:18:07] she did you remember I said you just see
[2:18:10] Miriam batts cuz her enemy is dead
[2:18:15] hallelujah why because when you begin to
[2:18:18] act upon the word you will have the word
[2:18:21] prophesied back to you hallelujah
[2:18:25] your enemy is dead do you know after she
[2:18:33] went back to her seat back there she
[2:18:35] still had the cough she still had
[2:18:38] weakness she still went under the doctor
[2:18:42] the next day for a scan and discovered
[2:18:49] her cancer was gone it was dead totally
[2:18:56] gone God had fought her battle mmm but
[2:19:00] did you know it took some time for her
[2:19:02] feelings to catch up with what with
[2:19:03] God's Word it took some time for her
[2:19:07] Street to catch up with God's Word come
[2:19:11] on it took some time it took some time
[2:19:14] for her symptoms to catch up with God's
[2:19:16] Word but the devil was gone remember
[2:19:21] when you realize God's Word is true and
[2:19:23] that he can't lie then it becomes
[2:19:25] through to you that nothing in the realm
[2:19:27] of feelin can ever separate you from the
[2:19:30] love of God and from the Word of God
[2:19:36] again I hear the skeptics say and I'm
[2:19:41] closed and bring your musicians you know
[2:19:43] remind me to quit I heard the skeptics
[2:19:47] and the critics say brother Tim this
[2:19:51] healing for sister Karen is not real
[2:19:53] because it didn't last well like I said
[2:19:56] thank you very much we've had five years
[2:19:58] of wonderful victory
[2:20:01] but it slide but it's just like telling
[2:20:04] me that God didn't deliver Israel from
[2:20:05] the Philistines you didn't win any war
[2:20:08] cause they've invaded again well let me
[2:20:11] tell you they're gonna get the same
[2:20:13] sauce again because we're not letting
[2:20:18] them take the land the battle is the
[2:20:22] Lord's the Word of God is against you
[2:20:27] Satan
[2:20:28] you've got to realise in your case where
[2:20:30] you're at this morning the Word of God
[2:20:32] is against the devil the Word of God is
[2:20:34] on your side go ahead and proclaim it
[2:20:37] the battle is not yours its the Lord's
[2:20:40] go go ahead and cry and proclaim it and
[2:20:44] put your faith on the Word of God
[2:20:45] because so you know that is that that
[2:20:48] again faith is the substance of things
[2:20:50] hoped for it's the evidence of things
[2:20:53] not seen
[2:20:53] it's the realities it's the confidence
[2:20:58] the God's Word is true how do I know I'm
[2:21:07] healed I was prayed for and I don't feel
[2:21:09] no different how do I know I'm healed
[2:21:14] well because God said if we laid handle
[2:21:17] the sick they shall recover and God
[2:21:21] don't lie God said whatever we ask in
[2:21:26] his name um won't do it and he don't he
[2:21:31] don't go back on his promise he's not a
[2:21:34] man that he has to repent
