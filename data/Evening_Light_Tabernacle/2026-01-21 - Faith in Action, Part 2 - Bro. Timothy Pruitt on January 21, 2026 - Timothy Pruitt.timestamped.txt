[21:24] having an irregular heartbeat. They're
[21:27] doing some more testing on her. Ask that
[21:28] we'd remember her. Also, brother Justin
[21:31] and sister Lillian Wear asked for prayer
[21:33] for their baby Millie. She has a croo
[21:36] needs a touch in her body. Also Hunter
[21:39] Taggard is sick and needs touch in his

[21:44] from sister Lily Pterully. She says,
[21:47] "Please remember to pray for me and
[21:48] Caleb. Been having some horrible stomach
[21:51] problems for the last few weeks. It
[21:53] feels like a Charlie horse in my
[21:55] stomach. Caleb's been dealing with some
[21:57] sinus trouble for quite a while now.
[22:00] He's on some medication, but nothing has
[22:02] been seeming to work. So ask that we
[22:04] remember both of them. Ask brother Aaron
[22:07] Oglesby if he'll come open the service
[22:09] for us in prayer as we take these knees.
[22:13] several of them young children being

[36:42] My God is healer. My God is healer.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's awesome in power. My God.
[36:52] Say
[36:53] my God. Say it again. My God is gater.
[36:58] My God is gater.
[37:01] My God is stronger.
[37:04] Oh my.
[37:06] is higher than any other.
[37:12] My God is healer.
[37:15] Awesome in power. That's my God.
[37:20] Oh my God. And if our God
[37:27] and if our God is for us, then who could
[37:31] ever stop us? And if our God is with us,
[37:37] then what could stand?
[37:40] Oh, and if our God is for us, then who
[37:45] could ever stop us? And if our God is
[37:50] with us, then what could stand again?
[37:57] Oh, one must stand again.
[38:09] My God is gater.
[38:13] My God is stronger.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; There's no one like Jesus.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Our God is healer.
[38:28] Awesome power.
[38:37] Amen. Let's just go to him in prayer.
[38:39] Father, we come to you today, Lord, so
[38:42] thankful. You are greater.
[38:44] You are mightier. You're more than able
[38:47] for any situation, any sickness, any
[38:50] struggle. Anything that we could ever go
[38:52] through or deal with, Father. You're
[38:54] greater. Lord, today we just come to you
[38:57] with our whole hearts, Lord. just open
[38:59] before you, Father, asking you to come,
[39:02] you to speak, you to touch you to
[39:04] minister,
[39:05] Lord, you to walk down the aisles of our
[39:08] heart, Lord, and touch those parts of
[39:12] our lives, Lord, that maybe we don't
[39:14] know what to do with or we don't know
[39:16] where to turn to, but God, we could just
[39:18] give them to you because you're greater.
[39:21] Lord, we give this service to you,
[39:23] everything to be said and done for your
[39:24] glory. We ask it in Jesus name.
[39:28] Amen.
[39:30] Turn to John chapter 5 and verse one.
[39:35] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[39:36] the Lord.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Says, "After this, there was a feast of
[39:43] the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
[39:46] Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep
[39:48] market a pool which is called in the
[39:51] Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five
[39:53] porches. In these lay a great multitude
[39:57] of impotent folk of blind halt withered
[40:00] waiting for the moving of the water. For
[40:02] an angel went down at a certain season
[40:05] into the pool and troubled the water.
[40:08] Whosoever then first after the trouble
[40:10] in the water stepped in was made whole
[40:12] of whatsoever disease he had. A certain
[40:16] man was there which had infirmity 30 and
[40:19] 8 years. And when Jesus saw him lie, he
[40:22] knew that he had been there a long time.
[40:24] in that case. And he said unto him,
[40:26] "Wilt thou be made whole?" And the
[40:28] impotent man answered him, saying, "Sir,
[40:32] I have no man when the waters troubled
[40:34] to put me in the pool, for while I'm
[40:36] coming, another stepeth down before me."
[40:39] And Jesus said unto him, "Rise, take up
[40:42] thy bed, and walk." And immediately the
[40:44] man was made whole, and took up his bed,
[40:47] and walked. And on the same day was the
[40:49] Sabbath. And the Jews therefore said
[40:51] unto him that was cured, it is the
[40:53] Sabbath day, is it not lawful for thee
[40:55] to carry thy bed? And he answered them,
[40:58] he that made me whole. The same said
[41:01] unto me, take up thy bed and walk. Then
[41:04] asked they him, what man is that which
[41:06] said unto thee, take up thy bed and
[41:08] walk? And he and he that was healed was
[41:11] not who it was? For Jesus had conveyed
[41:13] himself away, a multitude being in that
[41:16] place. Afterward, Jesus findeth him in
[41:18] the temple, and said unto him, "Behold,
[41:21] thou art made whole. Sin no more, lest a
[41:24] worse thing come unto thee." Amen. We
[41:27] let you be seated.
[41:30] This evening, once again, I'd like to
[41:33] speak to you on faith and action.
[41:36] As we our scripture here, as we read,
[41:39] it's actually a call to obedient faith.
[41:44] And obedient faith is a faith in action
[41:46] or a faith in motion. You know, the
[41:49] command that Jesus gave required action.
[41:52] He said to him, "Take up your bed and
[41:55] walk." The man had to believe the word
[41:57] of Jesus and then act on it and to move
[42:01] in faith before he ever had proof of his
[42:04] healing before he maybe even felt one
[42:07] thing. Amen. It was he didn't, you know,
[42:09] Jesus didn't tell him, "Well, when you
[42:10] feel better, then rise up or when you
[42:12] feel a little change, rise up." No, he
[42:14] just said, "Rise and take thy bed and
[42:16] walk." It was a direct call to put faith
[42:19] into action. It was not just an
[42:22] agreement of what he said or agreement
[42:24] in his mind that this is a good thought
[42:26] or a good thing, but to actually move.
[42:28] Amen. A faith that moves and not just a
[42:31] faith that believes. And you know in
[42:34] every account in through the scripture a
[42:36] person had to act on what Jesus said on
[42:39] his word. The paralytic in Mark chapter
[42:42] 2 you know did not argue. He did not
[42:44] hesitate. He did not test his legs
[42:47] first. The man at Bethesda in John 5 had
[42:50] been helpless for 38 years. Yet he moved
[42:53] at the command. So faith became real the
[42:57] moment action began.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; It became real the moment action began.
[43:02] And immediately and the scripture says
[43:04] immediately he rose and took up his bed
[43:06] and went before them all. You know as I
[43:09] said Jesus didn't say feel strength and
[43:11] then walk. He didn't say when you feel
[43:14] better walk. He said rise. It shows a b
[43:17] biblical principle here that the word
[43:18] comes first and then the action follows
[43:21] and then power meets you in your action.
[43:25] It meets you in motion. Amen. Just as
[43:27] Peter had to take to make the motion of
[43:30] stepping out of a boat. Amen. and the
[43:32] healed man had to stand up while
[43:34] trusting the word of God. What taking up
[43:37] the bed meant or symbolized also spoke
[43:39] of no return to that same old position.
[43:42] There was no place to retreat to. There
[43:45] was no going back to a former weakness.
[43:47] And this is what Jesus said, you know,
[43:49] don't disbelieve anymore unless a worse
[43:52] thing come upon you. In other words,
[43:54] there's no going back to this. There's
[43:56] there's no returning to this. It was a
[43:58] visible declaration that God has done
[44:01] something for me. So faith was no longer
[44:05] inward. It was a it was demonstrated in
[44:07] this man rising up and getting his bed
[44:10] and walking. Amen. Is a faith, you know,
[44:13] a faith that carries what once carried
[44:16] you. I'm thankful for that kind of
[44:18] faith. Amen. A faith that'll Amen. move
[44:21] in the moment. A faith that responds
[44:24] even when it looks like there is no way
[44:26] for anything to happen. A faith that'll
[44:29] move when everything seems unmovable. A
[44:32] faith that obeys even when the step
[44:35] feels impossible. Amen. What is it? The
[44:37] word speaks, but it needs a vessel to
[44:40] put it into action. Amen. Or other
[44:42] words, it's just dead letter. But it has
[44:44] to become a written epistle read unto
[44:46] all men. It's a it's an action. Jesus
[44:48] said to the sick of the Pauly, "Son, thy
[44:51] sins be forgiven. Arise, take up thy bed
[44:54] and walk." Nothing changed physically
[44:56] until Jesus spoke. So faith, Amen, began
[44:59] by hearing. As we know in Romans 10,
[45:01] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[45:04] the word of God. And an action followed.
[45:06] This healed man responded in obedience.
[45:10] He didn't respond in discussion. He
[45:12] didn't respond in well, if I do this,
[45:14] then what will happen? But immediately
[45:16] he arose and he took his bed and he went
[45:18] forth. The miracle though was not
[45:21] activated by effort. It was activated by
[45:24] obedient response to the word that was
[45:26] given.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not about our efforts. I'm
[45:29] not trying to make it our efforts and
[45:31] what we do, but it's being obedient to
[45:33] respond to what the word has told you to
[45:36] do. Amen. So Jesus, Amen, like I said,
[45:39] consistently required movement. He would
[45:41] say to the withered hand, "Stretch forth
[45:44] thy hand." He didn't say when it felt
[45:46] better, you felt a little tingle or you
[45:48] felt something. He just said, "Stretch
[45:50] forth thy hand." And they would begin in
[45:52] that action. When they begin that
[45:54] action, then power met them in the
[45:56] motion. Amen. Go wash in the pool of
[45:59] Saleom. He would tell that to a blind
[46:00] man. That blind man walked there blind.
[46:03] He walked there and could not see. But
[46:05] he came away from there seeing. Why?
[46:07] Because power met him in his motion in
[46:10] in his action. Amen. When he told the
[46:12] disciples to launch out into the deep,
[46:15] what was it? They took action upon the
[46:17] word that was spoke and the power met
[46:20] them in their motion. It met them IN
[46:22] THEIR ACTION. GOD'S power is manifested
[46:25] when faith is put into action.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's all through the scriptures.
[46:30] Amen. and the 10 lepers in Luke 17:14,
[46:34] he told them to go show themselves to
[46:36] the priests. Now, if you'll follow the
[46:38] scriptures, as they went, they were
[46:41] cleansed.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't they were healed and
[46:45] then goes, "No, but as they they walked
[46:47] away from him lepers, but as they went,
[46:50] as they followed what the word said,
[46:53] then the power met them in the action.
[46:55] It met them in motion. as they begin to
[46:58] follow exactly what the word spoken to
[47:00] them. I believe tonight if we can get
[47:02] somebody to follow what the word spoke
[47:05] to them that the power of God will meet
[47:07] you in the action. It'll meet you in the
[47:10] motion as you fulfill the word of God.
[47:13] Amen. Amen. When Peter was to come out
[47:15] of the ship, he walked on water, but he
[47:17] had to come out of the ship first. He
[47:19] could sit in the boat. He could talk to
[47:21] Jesus all he wanted to. But until he put
[47:23] it into action, if he'd have never went
[47:25] into action, he'd have never walked on
[47:27] water. Amen. He would have never felt
[47:30] the power of God given him the ability
[47:32] to overcome, Amen. the the human
[47:35] thoughts and human thinking of if I get
[47:37] on this water, water don't hold man,
[47:39] gravity's going to pull me down. But he
[47:41] got past all of that and he put Jesus
[47:44] words. What was Jesus words? Come.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like how Jesus does it. He He
[47:49] gives us a command, but he doesn't tell
[47:51] us all what's going to happen in that
[47:52] command. He didn't tell Peter, "Come and
[47:55] you're going to walk on the water like
[47:56] I'm walking on the water. You're going
[47:58] to overcome like I'm No, he just showed
[48:00] him to come out and it caused an action
[48:02] in Peter." He had to put that word come
[48:05] into action. And when he stepped out
[48:07] into the water, then the power of God
[48:09] met him in the water. It met him in the
[48:12] motion of the word as he put the word
[48:14] into motion. Amen. The healing doesn't
[48:17] wait. Healing does not wait for
[48:19] certainty. Amen. Power meets faith in
[48:22] motion. GOD SPEAKS, WE RESPOND, God
[48:26] confirms.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith though is not a passive
[48:30] waiting. It's an act of trust.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's action first. It's hearing
[48:36] the word. It's responding to the word
[48:38] and then God meets us when we put that
[48:41] word into action. This is what it was at
[48:44] the Red Sea in Israel. They came up
[48:45] against the Red Sea. What happened? It
[48:47] looked impossible. It looked like they
[48:49] didn't have boats enough. They didn't
[48:50] have they they couldn't they couldn't
[48:52] they didn't know how they was going to
[48:53] get past it. And they started looking at
[48:55] their past and looking at their failures
[48:56] and but the word spoke and it said speak
[48:59] unto the children of Israel that they go
[49:02] forward.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; That they go forward. Amen. The ocean,
[49:06] the sea was still there, but the action
[49:09] followed. They stepped towards AN
[49:11] IMPOSSIBLE SEA. THEY STEPPED TOWARDS
[49:14] SOMETHING THAT LOOKED HUMANLY IMPOSSIBLE
[49:16] AND THE POWER MET THEM IN THE MOTION. IT
[49:20] MET THEM IN THE ACTION AND THE WATERS
[49:23] WERE DIVIDED.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Old Hebrew writings will write of
[49:28] how these men actually heard the word
[49:31] speak speak and go forward and they
[49:34] actually begin to take their belongings
[49:36] and walk into that water and it got up
[49:38] to their nose before it parted. Yeah.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Listen, it may get up to
[49:44] your nose sometimes. IT MAY SEEM LIKE
[49:46] IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT IF YOU'RE
[49:48] FOLLOWING THE WORD, THE POWER IS GOING
[49:50] TO MEET YOU IN THE MOTION. IT'S GOING TO
[49:52] MEET YOU WHEN YOU'RE ACTIVE, PUTTING THE
[49:54] WORD IN ACTION.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen. It has to. It's
[49:58] too much scripture. Amen. Action came
[50:00] and the sea. Amen. The sea parted. Now,
[50:03] it didn't part before they moved. It
[50:05] part as they was moving towards it. The
[50:07] Jordan River, the same thing. The word
[50:09] came, when you come to the brink of the
[50:12] water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in
[50:15] Jordan. Amen. The priest stepped into
[50:18] flooded waters.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Right? Brother Brown teaches this. He
[50:22] said it was in in the springtime. And he
[50:24] said it was flooded out of its banks. It
[50:26] was not just a little trickling stream.
[50:28] It was impossible for them to get
[50:30] across. And the word said, "You're to
[50:32] step into the waters. You're to step
[50:35] into that Jordan River. And as they bear
[50:37] the ark, they that bear the ark came to
[50:40] the Jordan, the waters stood and rose up
[50:43] on as a heap. What was it? The power of
[50:46] God met them in the motion. It met them
[50:50] in the action. Amen. They had to have an
[50:53] ACTION FOR THE POWER OF GOD TO BE
[50:55] FULFILLED. AMEN. We can read about a non
[50:58] the prophecy, the prophet that told him
[50:59] to go dip in the river seven times into
[51:02] the Jordan. The word came first, go and
[51:05] wash in the Jordan seven times. Now,
[51:07] this man, he was very wroth when he
[51:09] heard this. It was actually a servant of
[51:11] his and said, "Hey, you came all this
[51:13] way. You might as well put what he said
[51:14] into action. You might as well believe
[51:16] what he said." And he began to dip
[51:18] himself and as he come the seventh time,
[51:21] power met him in his obedience. Amen.
[51:25] That he followed what the prophet said
[51:27] and his flesh came again like unto the
[51:30] flesh of a little child. Healing comes
[51:33] after obedience.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; When you obey the word OF GOD, GOD IS
[51:37] OBLIGATED TO FULFILL his word.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; This is what brother Brandham taught us
[51:41] as well. I mean, he said if the one man
[51:43] gets healed and the next man comes and
[51:44] he meets all the same obligations that
[51:46] the first man met, God is therefore
[51:48] obligated to heal that man. What is it?
[51:51] When you put that word into action, God
[51:54] is obligated to you. Amen. He's not
[51:57] obligated as long as you just sit there
[51:58] and try to think about it. Well, I
[52:00] believe it. I believe it. NO, BUT WHEN
[52:02] YOU PUT IT INTO ACTION in your life,
[52:04] THEN IT MAKES GOD obligated to you.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He would do that in the widow's
[52:10] oil. Amen. The word came first. When the
[52:13] widow didn't have no money, didn't have
[52:15] anything. The prophet said, "Go borrow
[52:16] all these vessels and then take the
[52:18] vessel of oil and pour it out." What was
[52:21] it? She poured from an empty pot. And
[52:24] power met her in her motion, in the
[52:27] action of her faith. And the Bible says
[52:29] that the oil stayed not. It stay it
[52:31] never ran out.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; As she would follow the WORD OF THE
[52:35] PROPHET and she would begin to pour out,
[52:38] it would pour out oil and she'd fill
[52:40] this vessel up and fill this vessel up
[52:42] and fill this vessel up. WHAT WAS IT?
[52:44] THE POWER OF GOD met her as she
[52:46] fulfilled the word that was spoken to
[52:48] her. Listen, IF YOU'LL FULFILL THE WORD
[52:51] THAT IS SPOKEN OF YOU, THE POWER OF GOD
[52:53] IS OBLIGATED TO MEET YOU IN THE MOTION.
[52:59] AMEN.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; As is what he said again as he said,
[53:03] "Stretch forth thy hand." The word came
[53:06] first. Stretch forth thine hand and the
[53:10] action followed. The man stretched what
[53:13] was withered.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; It wasn't healed and then he stretched
[53:18] it. He stretched out a withered hand.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the the man stretched out
[53:25] what was withered and power met him. The
[53:28] Bible says and his hand was restored
[53:31] whole. He had to attempt what he could
[53:34] not do.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; What seemed impossible AND MAYBE HE
[53:39] TRIED MANY TIMES BEFORE AND IT SEEMED
[53:41] but the word came
[53:44] &gt;&gt; and THE WORD WAS SPOKE OVER HIM AND HE
[53:46] BELIEVED the word but not only did he
[53:48] believe the word HE PUT THE WORD INTO
[53:50] ACTION. AMEN.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, God wants more than a word
[53:55] believe. HE WANTS WORDS IN ACTION.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT BROTHER Brandham said. GOD
[54:00] JEFFERSON BUILDS THOUSANDS OF live
[54:02] voices that are that are that are lives
[54:05] that are in action. That's voices that
[54:08] are speaking the word of God. That's
[54:09] voices that are living THE WORD OF GOD,
[54:11] not just on dead letters somewhere at a
[54:14] Bible rolled up or TAPES ON A SHELF.
[54:16] THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD DESIRES. GOD WANTS
[54:18] ACTION.
[54:20] PEOPLE FULFILLING THE word of God and as
[54:23] they are fulfilling and walking in step
[54:26] with the word then the power is there to
[54:28] meet them and to fulfill that word
[54:30] they're not we're not able to fulfill it
[54:32] on our own we're not saying that
[54:34] &gt;&gt; I can't fulfill nothing that God said on
[54:36] my own I can only do as he said
[54:41] &gt;&gt; right it's what we said about the blind
[54:43] man
[54:45] amen the blind man he told him to go
[54:47] wash in the pool of shalom Oh, he went
[54:50] blind.
[54:53] You know, it's one of my favorite
[54:55] stories in the Bible because it's so
[54:57] confounded the religious men of that day
[55:00] because here this blind man and Jesus
[55:02] comes up to him and he sees that he
[55:04] doesn't have even eyeballs.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; And brother Brown talks about how it was
[55:07] the creator there that day that said,
[55:09] "Let there be."
[55:11] &gt;&gt; And he would in some dirt.
[55:16] I don't know if he was blind hearing
[55:17] them sounds what you might think for a
[55:19] moment. He said, "But he spit in the
[55:22] dirt and he be to make a mud pile." He
[55:24] said, "But what was it?" It was the
[55:26] creator in action.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; And he actually began to put mud in his
[55:30] eyes and he said, "Now you go wash in
[55:33] the pool of salom." Now he walked there
[55:35] trying to feel his way. He But what was
[55:38] it? He was putting the word that Jesus
[55:40] spoke to him in action. That's right.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you may not have it all
[55:44] FIGURED OUT. GUESS WHAT? You don't have
[55:46] to have it all figured out.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Right? You don't have to have it all. 1
[55:50] plus 1 equals 2 and 2 plus 2 equals 4
[55:53] and this and this great big problem ALL
[55:55] FIGURED. IT AIN'T UP TO US TO SOLVE THE
[55:57] PROBLEMS. IT'S US UP TO US TO believe
[56:00] the WORD THAT WAS SPOKEN OF US AND PUT
[56:02] IT IN ACTION.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; He had an impossible problem. I got to
[56:09] go find the pool of salom. I'm a blind
[56:10] man.
[56:11] But he was just following what the word
[56:13] spoke to him. And as he followed it, no
[56:16] doubt people like, "What are you doing?
[56:17] You crazy. What you got all that mud on
[56:18] your face?" I'm only doing what the word
[56:20] said.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; What are you doing dressed like that?
[56:23] What are you doing acting like? I'm only
[56:25] doing what the word said.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Right. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why you
[56:30] acting like that way in church? I'm only
[56:32] doing what the word said.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Right. And here he comes back seeing.
[56:38] What was it? He said he went his way
[56:40] therefore and washed and came seeing.
[56:44] And then Jesus had pulled himself back
[56:46] and he he never saw Jesus with his own
[56:49] eyes. So he didn't know who the man was.
[56:50] He just knew that I once was blind. Now
[56:52] I can see
[56:54] &gt;&gt; and so he well goes into the temple and
[56:55] they like well who who did this who? And
[56:58] they started questioning well bring his
[57:00] parents. Well the parents didn't want to
[57:02] give no answer. Ask him. He was the one
[57:04] that that had this experience. He was
[57:06] the one that received this. Ask him. And
[57:08] and this man finally stops. HE SAID,
[57:10] "WELL, THIS IS A marvelous thing." He
[57:12] said, "Never since the world began as a
[57:15] man being born blind, given his eyes,
[57:17] his sight, and you don't know who that
[57:19] is,
[57:21] &gt;&gt; right? What was it?" HE KNEW BECAUSE GOD
[57:24] HAD SPOKE TO HIM. AND THE WORD THAT WAS
[57:26] SPOKE CAME TO pass
[57:29] &gt;&gt; and it was manifested. Is it what again?
[57:31] To the lepers. Go show yourself to the
[57:33] priest. They went away still lepers.
[57:37] They didn't have it all figured out, but
[57:39] power met them in the way.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; As they went, they were cleansed
[57:46] in the miraculous catch of fish. You
[57:49] know, the scripture says Jesus told them
[57:51] to launch out to the deep and let down
[57:53] your your your nets.
[57:56] They obeyed against their own
[57:58] experience.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; They were fishermen. THEY THEY DONE
[58:01] TOILED ALL NIGHT. THEY DONE FISH. They
[58:03] done sain. THEY DONE FIGURED GOT IT ALL
[58:04] FIGURED OUT. THEY AIN'T NO FISH.
[58:06] According
[58:08] to their own ideas and intellectual
[58:10] abilities, there wasn't nothing there.
[58:12] But Jesus said there was
[58:15] &gt;&gt; What did he Yeah. He said, "Go out and
[58:17] launch let your nets down. That's good
[58:20] enough. Just go do what he said."
[58:23] Right. This is what this is what they
[58:24] did at the at the wedding at Canaa. And
[58:27] and and they said, "Go get me some new
[58:29] some bottles of water." And what was it?
[58:31] Mary said, "Just go do what he said. If
[58:34] you do what he said, then a miracle is
[58:36] going to take place.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. If you'll do what he said,
[58:41] a miracle will take place in your life.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just go do what he said. Let down
[58:47] your nets. They obeyed against
[58:49] experience and then power met them and
[58:52] they and the scripture says they were
[58:54] enclosed a great multitude of fish.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, YOU'RE SERVING A GOD THAT CAN
[59:00] CREATE A FISH OUT OF NOTHING.
[59:03] There may not have been no FISH DOWN
[59:05] THERE, BUT when he TOLD HIM TO PUT DOWN
[59:07] THEIR NETS, HE COULD CREATE A BILLION
[59:09] FISH IF HE WANTED TO.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; He could create a NUMBER OF INNUMERABLE
[59:13] AMOUNT OF FISH. HE'S A CREATOR WITH
[59:15] limitless abilities.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT LIMITED by your mind. He's not
[59:21] limited by how you think. He's not,
[59:23] thank God, HE'S NOT LIMITED BY OUR HUMAN
[59:25] ABILITIES. WE SERVE A GOD WHO IS NOT
[59:28] LIMITED.
[59:29] SO IF HE TELLS YOU TO DO SOMETHING, DO
[59:31] WHAT HE SAID CUZ HE'S GOING TO MEET YOU
[59:33] WHERE HE TOLD YOU.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; LAZARUS, the word came, take away the
[59:43] stone.
[59:44] I remember as a young man hearing
[59:46] brother Donnie preached this thing. He
[59:48] titled it Mary's Belief at Youth Camp.
[59:52] And he said, "Ain't this amazing? Jesus
[59:54] turned to those women and said, "Take
[59:56] away the stone."
[59:59] 12 disciples there turns to the women.
[1:00:04] Take away the stone. He said he acted it
[1:00:06] all out. Getting up, if I remember
[1:00:07] right, got up against the pull pit and
[1:00:08] begin to Mary, are you pushing?
[1:00:14] What was it? It required an action.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; This wasn't the disciples miracle. This
[1:00:20] was Mary and Martha's miracle.
[1:00:24] Amen. Sometimes we want other people to
[1:00:26] do something so we can receive a
[1:00:27] miracle. NO, GOD REQUIRES us to do what
[1:00:30] he said so we can receive the miracle.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, action followed. THEY HAD TO
[1:00:37] THEY HAD TO MOVE THE STONE AND POWER
[1:00:39] CAME. LAZARUS COME FORTH.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; THEY WOULD HAVE NEVER GOT TO THE
[1:00:45] RESURRECTION POWER IF THEY WOULD HAVE
[1:00:47] NOT PUT HIS WORD INTO ACTION and move
[1:00:49] the stone.
[1:00:54] Resurrection power came after obedience.
[1:00:56] God speaks, faith responds, powers
[1:01:00] confirm.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Obedience to the word creates the
[1:01:04] meeting place for God's power.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Hello. I say it again so you write that
[1:01:11] down. Obedience to the word creates the
[1:01:15] meeting place for God's power.
[1:01:20] Faith does not wait for evidence. It
[1:01:23] moves when the word says move.
[1:01:26] Amen. Well, you know, it's directly
[1:01:28] tied. One of the one of the scriptures I
[1:01:30] want to bring out for a moment is
[1:01:31] Moses's hands that were lifted in the
[1:01:34] wilderness in Exodus 17 and verse 8
[1:01:36] through13. It's one of the clearest
[1:01:38] scriptures of faith that must be active
[1:01:41] faith and not just merely believed.
[1:01:44] Amen. It's the word in the action and
[1:01:46] power meeting you. Amen. in the action.
[1:01:50] Listen, the B this battle that was that
[1:01:52] that Joshua was down in the valley f
[1:01:54] fighting was won or lost by visible
[1:01:58] obedience.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Right? Moses's hands being lifted up.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; It was WON OR LOST BY VISIBLE OBEDIENCE.
[1:02:06] Scripture says in Exodus 17:11, "It came
[1:02:09] to pass when Moses held up his hands,
[1:02:12] the Israelites prevailed. But when he
[1:02:14] let his hand down, Amalecch prevailed.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Come on now. SO IT REQUIRED AN ACTION.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; IT REQUIRED SOMETHING THAT HAD TO HAPPEN
[1:02:26] for them to get the victory.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; I CAN'T DRIVE THAT HOME ENOUGH. YOU
[1:02:31] THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE REQUIRED.
[1:02:33] IF YOU WANT SOMETHING OUT OF THIS
[1:02:35] SERVICE, THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S
[1:02:36] REQUIRED OF YOU.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. It ain't all just on a PREACHER OR
[1:02:42] A SONG LEADER TO KEEP YOU MUSICIANS.
[1:02:44] IT'S UP ON US. ARE WE FOLLOWING WHAT THE
[1:02:47] WORD SAID DO?
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Are we in OBEDIENCE TO WHAT THE WORD
[1:02:51] SAYS?
[1:02:53] WELL, I know why I don't like that song.
[1:02:55] I don't like It ain't got nothing to do
[1:02:56] about what I like. It's about what his
[1:02:59] word says.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; I don't like the way they're play. It
[1:03:01] ain't got nothing to do with the way I
[1:03:03] like it. IT HAS WITH WHAT THE WORD SAYS.
[1:03:06] THAT IF I respond to what the word says,
[1:03:09] God's going to meet me in my motion.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; But yeah, we want God to deliver our
[1:03:15] children and we want God to do this and
[1:03:17] we want God to do that. And we'll just
[1:03:19] sit there and stare at this screen as
[1:03:21] words are being sung and words never
[1:03:23] come out of our mouth and we're all in
[1:03:25] the mro. There's an action required.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; We got some issue there. Let that issue
[1:03:32] go. There's actions required here.
[1:03:35] It's class participation.
[1:03:37] It ain't all just on the man standing
[1:03:39] behind this desk. Thank God.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Listen, victory did not depend on
[1:03:43] Israel's military skill. Victory
[1:03:46] depended on Moses keeping his hands
[1:03:48] lifted.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; So faith is not a passive belief. IT'S A
[1:03:54] CONTINUED ACTION.
[1:03:58] WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS NOT A A PASSIVE
[1:04:00] MOMENT THAT YEAH, I'M IN ACTION ON
[1:04:02] SUNDAY, but on Monday I I don't believe
[1:04:04] no more. NO, YOU YOU CONTINUE TO BELIEVE
[1:04:07] LESS A WORSE THING COME UPON YOU.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; No wonder the Amalachites are taking a
[1:04:16] hold of you and taking hold of your your
[1:04:18] calm and your peace and all that. You
[1:04:20] ain't got your hands lifted up.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; You ain't praising God. You ain't giving
[1:04:25] him glory in the middle of the battle.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Faith is not passive. It's a CONTINUED
[1:04:31] ACTION. WHAT GOD HAS SPOKEN MUST BE
[1:04:34] ACTIVELY PUT INTO ACTION FOR HIS POWER
[1:04:37] TO FLOW. It has to. It's like a
[1:04:40] heartbeat. IT HAS TO BE MOVING. It has
[1:04:43] to be Amen. GOD'S WORD IS NOT A DEAD
[1:04:45] LETTER. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST SIT
[1:04:47] there and it just sit there to admire
[1:04:49] and to look at and say, "Wow, ain't that
[1:04:50] beautiful?" NO, IT'S TO PUT IT IN ACTION
[1:04:52] IN OUR LIVES.
[1:04:55] Lifted hands was showing I got a
[1:04:58] dependence on God and not my own
[1:05:00] strength and not the strength of my men.
[1:05:04] In the scriptures, lifted hands
[1:05:06] consistently res represent surrender.
[1:05:08] You can read that in Psalm 63 and 4. I
[1:05:10] won't go there at these scriptures, but
[1:05:12] also it represents a petition or or
[1:05:15] repentance.
[1:05:16] That's Psalms 28:2 and l Lamentations
[1:05:19] 3:41.
[1:05:20] But Moses standing with lifted hands
[1:05:23] declared this and declared the victory
[1:05:25] is not coming from having greater
[1:05:27] weapons or or a greater number of
[1:05:29] people. This victory is coming from the
[1:05:32] Lord and my obedience to his word.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Right? So victory is not coming from
[1:05:39] from something a place where I feel good
[1:05:41] all the time or things are going just
[1:05:43] right all the time. No, it's when it's
[1:05:45] not going all right. It's when things
[1:05:48] are all against you and the spirits of
[1:05:50] hell are coming against you, BUT YOU'RE
[1:05:51] WILLING TO FOLLOW THE WORD.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Not follow your feelings.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. Not follow how
[1:06:00] you feel or you feel good or don't. THAT
[1:06:02] HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. IT'S WITH THE
[1:06:05] WORD OF GOD. I'M GOING TO FOLLOW HIS
[1:06:07] WORD NO MATTER HOW I FEEL.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? So honestly, Moses had to keep
[1:06:16] his body, his posture in line with the
[1:06:20] word even when he got weary.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what we have to do in
[1:06:30] church sometimes, right?
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Keep our body, our posture in line with
[1:06:36] the word even when we're weary. Amen.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Even when we don't feel like singing,
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; even when we don't feel like entering
[1:06:44] in, even when things are against us, I'm
[1:06:47] going to keep my body and posture in
[1:06:49] line
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; with the word.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Even when I'm sick as a dog,
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna keep my body and posture in
[1:06:58] line with the word. You know, I I'm just
[1:07:00] going to give a man a flower right now.
[1:07:02] Brother Ron Spitzer fighting one of the
[1:07:05] worst battles of cancer a man's ever
[1:07:07] fought now. Five, was it five almost six
[1:07:09] years? Six years
[1:07:12] on chemo. And one of the greatest
[1:07:14] greatest testimonies I ever heard about
[1:07:16] the man is you'll never know it.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; People actually writing in saying he's
[1:07:22] acting and making it up
[1:07:25] because he ain't lost his hair. And
[1:07:27] because, you know, he never acts like he
[1:07:28] ain't feeling bad. He always looks good.
[1:07:31] It's a choice.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; You know what the choice is? I'm going
[1:07:34] to follow the word.
[1:07:37] I'm not going to follow my feet because
[1:07:38] listen, I've been behind the scenes
[1:07:39] enough to know that man don't always
[1:07:41] feel the greatest. Probably 98% of the
[1:07:43] time, he don't feel good.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; But when you greet him, he'll have a
[1:07:50] smile on his face.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; He won't talk about how bad it's been or
[1:07:54] how terrible it is and how MUCH TROUBLE,
[1:07:57] HOW MUCH of this, and how much OF THAT.
[1:07:58] NO, HE'LL SAY, "GOD BLESS YOU. GOOD TO
[1:08:00] SEE YOU. MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE THE
[1:08:02] GREATEST person in the room." WHAT IS
[1:08:03] IT? HE'S PUTTING HIS MOUTH. HE'S PUTTING
[1:08:06] HIS POSTURE, HE'S PUTTING HIS BODY IN
[1:08:08] LINE WITH THE WORD.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; And let ME TELL YOU, THE POWER WILL BE
[1:08:14] THERE TO MEET IT.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, MOSES' hands got weird. That's
[1:08:24] what the scripture said. His hands were
[1:08:26] very heavy. How many has ever just tried
[1:08:28] to hold your hands up? You know, it
[1:08:30] don't feel too bad for the first five
[1:08:32] minutes maybe,
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; but then it gets worse and worse.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; It was showing though that starting in
[1:08:38] faith is not enough.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Faith must be held until the victory is
[1:08:46] complete.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what the scripture says in
[1:08:51] Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 36. For you
[1:08:54] have need of patience after you've done
[1:08:56] the will of God that ye might receive
[1:08:58] the promise. Amen.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; So, it ain't just starting out in faith,
[1:09:02] though. It's continuing in faith. It's
[1:09:05] not just feeling faith on a Sunday or a
[1:09:07] Wednesday night. It's on the Monday
[1:09:09] morning blues. It's on Tuesday. IT'S ON
[1:09:10] THURSDAY. IT'S ON FRIDAY. IT'S ON
[1:09:12] SATURDAY. IT'S ON EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK,
[1:09:15] 247, 365, 666, whatever year we're in
[1:09:19] days a year.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Faith must be upheld.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Do I always feel like having my hands
[1:09:28] up? No, I don't. Do I always feel like I
[1:09:32] want to surrender? No, I don't. Do I
[1:09:34] always feel like I'm on top of the val
[1:09:36] up on top of the mountain, not down? No,
[1:09:38] I don't. But that has nothing to do with
[1:09:41] our feelings. Has nothing to do with our
[1:09:43] faith. We've got to separate the two.
[1:09:46] That's right.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; The Bible doesn't say that the battle
[1:09:51] ended when Moses lifted up his hands,
[1:09:54] but it does say as long as his hands
[1:09:56] were lifted, Israel prevailed.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Again, it goes with what we've been
[1:10:02] speaking about, the priests stepping
[1:10:04] into the Jordan, the lepers going to the
[1:10:06] priest still while still unclean, the
[1:10:08] man taking his bed up before strength
[1:10:10] was fully returned. Faith acts
[1:10:14] first and then power follows the
[1:10:17] movement.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; We want the power, then we'll have the
[1:10:22] faith. No, that ain't the way it
[1:10:23] happens. You get the faith and then you
[1:10:26] act on it and then the power will come.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; This is what he shows there in Isaiah.
[1:10:30] Brother Brandon would bring this out
[1:10:31] very clearly in Isaiah seen the angels
[1:10:34] before the throne. They had we spoke on
[1:10:36] the wings of faith last weekend. And
[1:10:37] this kind of ties a little bit in with
[1:10:39] that around the throne with three sets
[1:10:42] of wings. One to cover his face, which
[1:10:44] brother Brandon would teach that was
[1:10:45] reverence. And one set to cover his feet
[1:10:48] was humility and respect. But there was
[1:10:50] another set to it was a set to fly. It
[1:10:53] was to be an action. It wasn't good
[1:10:55] enough just to have reverence. It wasn't
[1:10:57] good enough just to have humility and
[1:10:58] respect, BUT IT HAD TO BE AN ACTION.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; This is what THIS IS WHAT GOD DESIGNED
[1:11:05] his angels TO BE. HE WAS SHOWING US WHAT
[1:11:07] WE MUST BE. We brother Brandon would
[1:11:09] bring it out. Go listen to it. Amen. He
[1:11:11] was showing us that we have to be
[1:11:12] reverent towards the word, HAVE RESPECT
[1:11:14] TOWARDS THE WORD, BELIEVE THE WORD, BUT
[1:11:16] WE HAVE TO PUT THE WORD INTO ACTION.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; He said, like the woman at the well,
[1:11:24] when she saw something happen, he said
[1:11:27] she had two wings, brother. She got away
[1:11:29] with with them real quick. She'd come
[1:11:31] out there to Jacob's well to get some of
[1:11:33] that contaminated water that they were
[1:11:35] arguing about. But what she got was a
[1:11:37] drink out of the fountain of life and
[1:11:40] she went into action right quick. She
[1:11:42] didn't say, "Well, sir, please tell me.
[1:11:44] Let me get a deeper understanding here.
[1:11:46] What where did you get your education?
[1:11:48] Where did you get this stuff? How did
[1:11:50] you learn that I I only had I had five
[1:11:53] husbands and the man I'm living with is
[1:11:54] not my husband? HOW DID YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:11:56] WAS wrong with me? Can you tell me? Can
[1:11:58] you explain it to me better? Can you
[1:11:59] give me a better intellectual
[1:12:01] understanding? No, she never questioned.
[1:12:02] She never tried TO UNDERSTAND BETTER.
[1:12:04] SHE JUST SOMETHING INSIDE OF HER SAID,
[1:12:06] "SIR, I PERCEIVE YOU'RE A PROPHET."
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; And something began TO STIR ON THE
[1:12:14] INSIDE OF HER UNTIL HE TOOK HER TO A
[1:12:16] PLACE THAT NOT ONLY DID SHE SEE IT WAS A
[1:12:18] PROPHET, SHE SAW THAT HE WAS THE MESSIAH
[1:12:20] TO COME.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER SAID IT PUT HER INTO ACTION.
[1:12:25] AND HE SAID, "I am he." AND SHE WENT
[1:12:27] RIGHT INTO ACTION RIGHT DOWN INTO THE
[1:12:29] CITY AS HARD AS SHE GO. COME SEE A MAN
[1:12:32] WHO'S TOLD ME EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE.
[1:12:34] ISN'T THIS THE MESSIAH? WHEN SHE SAW THE
[1:12:36] TRUTH, she didn't try to pack the ball.
[1:12:39] She didn't TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT. SHE HAD
[1:12:41] A LOT OF RESPECT. She had she g she was
[1:12:44] sure to GIVE A LOT OF SUPPORT, BUT SHE
[1:12:46] WENT DOWN AND SAID, "COME SEE, COME SEE.
[1:12:49] COME SEE." WHAT WAS IT? HER GOING INTO
[1:12:51] ACTION.
[1:12:56] And when you're in action following the
[1:12:58] word, you'll realize very quickly you're
[1:13:00] not concerned about earthly things.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Right? Because the scripture says she
[1:13:07] left her water pot
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; now. At the beginning of that scripture,
[1:13:11] that was the first thing she brought up
[1:13:12] when he asked her of a drink. And then
[1:13:15] she said, "Well, who are you to ask me
[1:13:17] of a drink?" You know, and go through
[1:13:18] that whole conversation. And then he
[1:13:20] said, "Well, if you knew who I was,
[1:13:21] you'd ask me of a drink." And she says,
[1:13:24] "Well, how are you going to get me a
[1:13:25] drink? You don't have a water pot."
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; So, she thought, "This is the most
[1:13:30] important thing in this conversation is
[1:13:31] this water pot."
[1:13:33] Well, we got all the way down to it. And
[1:13:35] when she went into action, she left it.
[1:13:40] She left what she thought that she had
[1:13:42] deemed necessary, what she thought was
[1:13:44] important, what what she thought was
[1:13:46] lifegiving. She found the real true
[1:13:47] lifegiver.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; And she left the same thing that
[1:13:51] happened to us. What we thought one time
[1:13:53] was a right thing. What we thought was
[1:13:55] one one time was a great thing. What we
[1:13:57] thought, what we kept, what we Oh, she
[1:13:59] left it.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz she went into action with the
[1:14:03] word.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; She went into action. You got them
[1:14:06] wings. She be to fly. Amen. When the
[1:14:09] Apostle Peter when he took God at his
[1:14:11] word one day out to sea, fished all
[1:14:13] night, hadn't take nothing. And Jesus
[1:14:15] said, "Past your net on the other side
[1:14:17] of the boat."
[1:14:20] Well, Lord, I'm a fisherman. I know when
[1:14:23] they bite and when they don't bite.
[1:14:26] I know when they're there and when
[1:14:28] they're not there.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; I FISHED ALL NIGHT and I haven't even I
[1:14:35] haven't even caught a little minnow.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; But if you say cast your net over there,
[1:14:41] I know there's no fish there, but at
[1:14:43] your word,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to let down the net. He went
[1:14:48] into action.
[1:14:52] Amen. It's brother R bring it down. He
[1:14:55] said it's time to get into action. If
[1:14:57] you're just a church member, it's time
[1:15:00] to get into action. If you don't know
[1:15:02] God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:15:04] it's time to get into action. He said,
[1:15:07] "Cover your face with reverence. Cover
[1:15:09] your FEET WITH HUMILITY. BOW ON YOUR
[1:15:11] KNEES and go into action. If you don't
[1:15:13] know God, GET IN ACTION." AMEN.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; WELL, they got another service. There
[1:15:20] may not be another service.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; We don't know.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; What the church needs, he says, is get
[1:15:30] in action. Oh, we got a lot of form.
[1:15:34] We got a little bit of worldly dignity
[1:15:35] about us, but we need some action.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; This bride needs some action.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Not just words on a tape. Not just words
[1:15:46] on scripture.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; What was it? What was the book wrote
[1:15:50] about the apostles? The book of acts.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Not the books of sitting on their
[1:15:56] laurels and tell swapping stories. How
[1:15:57] they used to walk with Jesus and how
[1:15:59] they used to be with Jesus and how they
[1:16:01] used to see miracles and how it used to
[1:16:02] be. NO, THEY WENT INTO ACTION. THAT'S
[1:16:04] RIGHT.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Went into action to WHERE THEY WALKED UP
[1:16:08] TO THE GATE CALLED BEAUTIFUL AND THERE'S
[1:16:10] a lame man sitting there and they
[1:16:12] begging for arms and he said Peter Peter
[1:16:14] said silver and gold have I none BUT
[1:16:16] WHAT I HAVE GIVE I UNTO THEE. THERE WAS
[1:16:18] AN ACTION THAT TOOK PLACE.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Give I unto thee in the name OF JESUS
[1:16:22] CHRIST RISE UP AND WALK.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; What was it showing? That the very
[1:16:28] action of Christ is now inside of other
[1:16:31] believers. Amen.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; This is what he was showing on Mo and
[1:16:35] Moses with his hands lifted up. HE WAS
[1:16:37] SHOWING THAT ONE DAY I'M GOING TO COME
[1:16:40] AND I'M GOING TO PUT MY HANDS UP FOR
[1:16:42] HUMILITY AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THEM
[1:16:44] DOWN UNTIL THE VICTORIES WON.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT DOWN UNTIL
[1:16:50] SATAN'S KINGDOM IS FINISHED.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; It was finished in water, blood, and
[1:16:58] spirit. the chemicals needed to create
[1:17:01] himself a bride left out of his body and
[1:17:03] it came back on the day of Pentecost.
[1:17:05] Not to put some people on their laurels
[1:17:07] and think about what they used to do and
[1:17:09] how it used to be. No, he's a God today.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; What such as I have rise up and walk
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; now this lame man had it had an
[1:17:18] opportunity whether he's going to think
[1:17:19] about it
[1:17:21] right
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; maybe next church service brother Peter
[1:17:25] speaks I I'll probably I'll probably
[1:17:27] move up to the altar. I I'll probably
[1:17:28] Make a commitment. Then the devil will
[1:17:31] talk you that way all the way to next
[1:17:33] year.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; All the way to the next year. If there
[1:17:35] is another year, all the way to hell.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Little carrot. Next service. Next
[1:17:42] service. Next service. We ain't worried
[1:17:44] about next service. May not have a next
[1:17:46] service. This service.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; This service.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; This service. This service. I'm getting
[1:17:52] the Holy Ghost. This service. I'm I'm
[1:17:54] receiving I'm receiving God as my
[1:17:56] savior. This service. I'm getting a
[1:17:58] renewal, a re a renewing of my spirit.
[1:18:00] I'm getting a renewing of the power of
[1:18:02] God. This service, I'm getting a healing
[1:18:04] IN MY BODY. THIS SERVICE, I I'M SEEING
[1:18:06] PROMISES BEING FULFILLED. WHY? BECAUSE
[1:18:08] I'M NOT WALKING ACCORDING TO MY
[1:18:10] FEELINGS. I'M WALKING ACCORDING TO THE
[1:18:12] WORD. HIS WORD SAID IT. I BELIEVE IT.
[1:18:15] AND I'M GOING TO WALK IN IT UNTIL THE
[1:18:17] POWER MEETS ME IN THE WORD.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Get in action.
[1:18:27] Well, he said and he said, "You shall
[1:18:29] receive Holy Ghost."
[1:18:31] He said, "Let me go back a little bit."
[1:18:33] He says, "The people in the Pentecost,
[1:18:35] they didn't know very much. Maybe
[1:18:37] couldn't even sign their own name." Some
[1:18:38] of them, they were scared up in the
[1:18:40] upper room. But one day, what did they
[1:18:41] do? They went into into the obedience to
[1:18:43] his word. They took his word.
[1:18:46] He said, "Oh, if people today would just
[1:18:49] take his word, then they'll get into
[1:18:52] action."
[1:18:54] Try in the city of Jerusalem.
[1:18:56] You shall receive the Holy Ghost after
[1:18:58] the promise. After this, the Holy Ghost
[1:19:00] shall come upon you. Then you'll be
[1:19:01] witnesses of me. Then you'll be put into
[1:19:03] action. What was it? Behold, I send the
[1:19:05] promise of the Father, but wait in the
[1:19:07] city of Jerusalem until due with power
[1:19:08] from on high. How long? 1 hour, 2 hour,
[1:19:10] 10 days, 4 months, 6 months. Didn't make
[1:19:12] any difference. Until. How long is that?
[1:19:15] Just until. But when God asks you for
[1:19:18] anything, stay right there until. Stay
[1:19:21] until. until what? It happens.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; STAY IN THE WORD until
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Don't get out of line. Brother, Brother
[1:19:31] Wayne Lawson preached a wonderful
[1:19:33] message some years back there in North
[1:19:35] Carolina, but I'm in line for a miracle.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; He brought it from the people that was
[1:19:42] there at the miracle of the breaking of
[1:19:44] the bread and the and the fishes. And he
[1:19:47] said they was all in line for a miracle.
[1:19:49] He said, 'What if one have went home
[1:19:51] early?
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Well, I got some something I need to
[1:19:54] take care of home and they just moved
[1:19:56] off or this they' have stepped out of
[1:19:58] line for their miracle.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; You don't know when the miracle will
[1:20:02] happen.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; But, uh, but it ain't up to me to figure
[1:20:05] out when it's going to happen, how it's
[1:20:07] going to happen, how God's going to
[1:20:08] fulfill his word, when it's going to
[1:20:10] happen. I It ain't up to me. What's up
[1:20:12] to me is to stay in the word.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; To stay with him until what? They were
[1:20:19] in the upper room praising and blessing
[1:20:21] God for what? The promise. They knew it
[1:20:24] had to come. How did they know it had to
[1:20:25] come? Cuz he said it was going to come.
[1:20:28] There you are. Get in action. Go to
[1:20:31] praising God till the promise is
[1:20:33] fulfilled.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Hello. YEAH.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; GO TO PRAISING GOD TILL THE PROMISE IS
[1:20:41] FULFILLED. YOU GOT THE PROMISE. IF YOU
[1:20:44] BELIEVE GOD HEALS, STAY IN ACTION.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Don't get in the mully grubs and brother
[1:20:51] brother Joe Forny would talk about it.
[1:20:53] The wy wowsy woos,
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what,
[1:21:00] nobody cares about me. Nobody
[1:21:02] understands what I'm going through. That
[1:21:03] ain't in action. That's in moly grubs.
[1:21:06] That ain't in the word. That's in your
[1:21:07] feeling. Get out of your feelings.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Get in the word.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. If God says he heals, stay in that
[1:21:14] word.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; He's going to bring it to pass as long
[1:21:18] as you're in that word.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Listen, you don't know when the healing
[1:21:22] angel's coming through the neighborhood.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN HE'S GOING TO
[1:21:29] WALK. WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, WE
[1:21:31] ENTERTAIN angels unaware.
[1:21:35] YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN HE'S COMING AND HE
[1:21:37] COMES TO VISIT YOU, BUT YOU'RE IN THE
[1:21:39] WRONG ATTITUDE.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Come on. YOU'RE NOT IN THE ATTITUDE TO
[1:21:45] RECEIVE A MIRACLE. YOU'RE ALL FRUSTRATED
[1:21:47] AND MAD AND TORE UP AND GOD'S READY TO
[1:21:49] GIVE YOU A MIRACLE, BUT YOU STEPPED OUT
[1:21:51] OF LINE.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; WELL, just do like the prophet taught
[1:21:55] us. Repent and get back in the line.
[1:21:58] get back in the word of God that when he
[1:22:00] comes THE NEXT TIME, I'M GOING TO BE IN
[1:22:02] THE WORD.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO BE STANDING ON THE WORD.
[1:22:05] I'm going to be believing the word.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; And when my feelings get out of sorts,
[1:22:09] I'm going to bring my feelings back
[1:22:10] subject to the word of God.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; The joy OF THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Stay in action.
[1:22:20] You got two wings. Stay in action.
[1:22:24] He says, "If you believe God heals, stay
[1:22:27] in action. If you believe he's going to
[1:22:29] call you, stay in action. Hold on.
[1:22:31] You're holding on to him, stay in
[1:22:33] action." You got two wings, so use them.
[1:22:35] Stay in action. Wave them back and forth
[1:22:37] and say, "Lord, I believe."
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe. He said, "If you can't
[1:22:42] holler, say, "Holy, holy, holy." Say,
[1:22:44] "Lord, I BELIEVE." STAY IN ACTION.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; They stayed in action TILL THERE CAME A
[1:22:50] SOUND FROM HEAVEN LIKE A RUSHING MIGHTY
[1:22:52] WIND. THEN they were really in action.
[1:22:54] THEY WERE PUT IN THE ACTION OF THE SAME
[1:22:56] GOD OF THE SAME SPIRIT OF THE same Holy
[1:22:58] Ghost
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; ought to we ought to be he said when we
[1:23:06] see the things that are being fulfilled
[1:23:07] in this day this was back in the 60s 50s
[1:23:11] and 60s he's preaching these messages
[1:23:13] talking about things that are being
[1:23:14] fulfilled how we ought to be in he how
[1:23:16] much more should we be in action
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; when we hear the war
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; drums beating
[1:23:23] We're standing at now at a time of
[1:23:26] nuclear destruction.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Threaten it straight out calling it out.
[1:23:32] Said if you do this, I'm going to bring
[1:23:34] the end.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; I guess I want to say then what?
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; You had the biggest bombs, but you still
[1:23:47] lost.
[1:23:53] But we hear all these things. We see
[1:23:54] things happening. We see the God
[1:23:56] fulfilling his word. We see all the
[1:23:58] signs that's being fulfilled. We see
[1:24:00] Israel in his place. We see the word
[1:24:03] Sunday, the violence and things and all
[1:24:05] the things that are going on. It is the
[1:24:06] word being fulfilled.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; IT IS GOD FULFILLING HIS WORD. IT'S THE
[1:24:12] WHEELS OR THE COGS OF PROPHECY THAT ARE
[1:24:14] GRINDING SLOW BUT SURE. BUT IT'S COMING
[1:24:17] DOWN to the end of the tape.
[1:24:21] IT'S COMING DOWN TO THE end of the line.
[1:24:23] And as as WE SAID BEFORE, AS IT WOULD
[1:24:25] GET DOWN TO THE END, IT GOES FASTER AND
[1:24:27] FASTER AND FASTER and faster and faster
[1:24:28] and it's gone.
[1:24:34] What kind of people should we be? What
[1:24:37] kind of expectations should we have?
[1:24:39] Don't let the Don't let the world blind
[1:24:41] you. The glare of Sodom and Gomorrah,
[1:24:43] the smoke get in your eyes so much
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; that you can't see what's really
[1:24:48] happening on.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; If it is in your eyes, I got a cure for
[1:24:52] you, it's called Isav.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; If all you can see is all the things and
[1:24:58] the terribleness and all that stuff and
[1:25:01] and the world, if that's all you can see
[1:25:02] and THE SMOKE IS BLINDING YOU, there is
[1:25:04] some eyes here tonight
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; that'll give you some clear vision that
[1:25:08] you can see. Not only is there a lot of
[1:25:10] demons been unleashed in THIS REALM, BUT
[1:25:12] THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF ANGELS THAT HAVE
[1:25:14] COME ON ON THE BEHALF OF THE BELIEVERS.
[1:25:16] WE'RE NOT IN THIS BATTLE ALONE.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; They're angels, as we've read, not just
[1:25:27] of humility and reverence, but they're
[1:25:29] also angels of action. We get a whole
[1:25:32] another sermon.
[1:25:35] He said, he said, "How how much ought we
[1:25:38] to be?" They saw the pillar of fire.
[1:25:39] We've saw the pillar of fire. They saw
[1:25:41] the They saw all the things take place
[1:25:43] in their day. We should also see the
[1:25:45] things that are taking place in our day.
[1:25:47] And he's tying it back and forth showing
[1:25:49] they're a book of Acts, but we should
[1:25:51] also be a book of Acts.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; We are the continuation of the book of
[1:25:54] Acts.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Not the book of sitting on our laurels
[1:25:58] and talking about 60 years ago. No, the
[1:26:00] book of action.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; NOT HUMAN ACTION. THE ACTS OF THE SPIRIT
[1:26:05] OF GOD MOVING IN HIS CHURCH.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's what the acts WERE ABOUT.
[1:26:09] IT WASN'T about this fuss AND ABOUT THAT
[1:26:11] FUSS. NO, IT'S WHAT GOD WAS DOING IN THE
[1:26:13] MIDST OF HIS PEOPLE.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; And let me TELL YOU, HE'S THE SAME GOD
[1:26:17] WITH THE SAME POWER AND THE SAME
[1:26:20] DEMONSTRATION. HE'S THE SAME IN PERSON.
[1:26:22] HE'S THE SAME IN DETAIL. HE'S THE SAME
[1:26:24] IN ACTION. HE'S THE SAME IN POWER.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE A CONTINUATION of the book of
[1:26:32] Acts.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; The acts of the Holy Ghost. Yes,
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; brother Rand would teach us many times
[1:26:43] about this. He said he never ordained us
[1:26:45] to build any church. He never ordained
[1:26:48] us to build hospitals or to schools or
[1:26:50] have a seminary. He never one time
[1:26:53] commissioned us to do that. All them
[1:26:54] things are okay. They're good. But yet
[1:26:56] he did commission us to preach the
[1:26:58] gospel to all the world.
[1:27:01] And he said, "And we have built churches
[1:27:04] and schools and seminaries and taught
[1:27:06] theologies and onethird of the world is
[1:27:09] all that's heard about Jesus yet. But
[1:27:11] after all the passing of tracks," he
[1:27:14] said, "But after all, passing tracks is
[1:27:16] not preaching the gospel." The gospel
[1:27:18] came not in word only, said Paul, but
[1:27:21] through the power and demonstration of
[1:27:22] the Holy Ghost. Not just teach the word,
[1:27:24] but preach it. Make it manifest. Make
[1:27:27] the word manifest. Make the word be
[1:27:28] alive. It's a dead letter until it's
[1:27:31] made manifest. But then when it's made
[1:27:33] manifest, it's quickened and brought to
[1:27:34] pass what God said about it. THAT IS THE
[1:27:38] GOSPEL IN ACTION.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE WORD OF God in action.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; He'll tell us in the church age book as
[1:27:53] we bring this down. Satan knows assurely
[1:27:56] that the original church at Pentecost
[1:27:58] with the power of God. Mark 16 in
[1:28:01] action.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Preach the word. Lay hands upon the sick
[1:28:09] and they shall recover. If they drink
[1:28:11] any deadly thing, it shall not harm
[1:28:13] them.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Mark 16 in action is the true church
[1:28:18] that Jesus claims as his own.
[1:28:22] If you don't find yourself in Mark 16,
[1:28:24] you are not the true church.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; That's the word. THAT'S JESUS RED
[1:28:32] LETTER.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE PROPHET COMING RIGHT BACK
[1:28:34] AROUND AND SAYING MARK 6:16 IN ACTION IS
[1:28:38] THE TRUE CHURCH THAT Jesus claims as his
[1:28:41] own.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; All else is false.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; It has to be.
[1:28:47] Yes.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; But remember this, Christ in the true
[1:28:50] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:28:53] Acts. But the book of Revelation shows
[1:28:56] that Antichrist spirit would come into
[1:28:58] the church and defile it, make it
[1:29:00] lukewarm, formal, and powerless.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; What is a powerless body? A body that
[1:29:06] has no action.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; It's dead.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, it might look beautiful. It might be
[1:29:12] a corpse bejeweled, but it's still a
[1:29:14] corpse.
[1:29:16] right
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; is still dead.
[1:29:22] But this book exposes Satan, revealing
[1:29:24] his works, the attempted destruction of
[1:29:26] God's people, and the discrediting of
[1:29:27] God's word right down to the time he's
[1:29:28] cast in the lake of fire. He fights
[1:29:30] that. He cannot stand. He knows that if
[1:29:32] the church gets the true revelation of
[1:29:34] the true church and what she is, what
[1:29:37] she stands for, she will be an
[1:29:40] invincible army.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; That she can do the greater work. She
[1:29:44] will be an invincible army if they get
[1:29:47] the true revelation of the two spirits
[1:29:48] within the framework. What are the true
[1:29:50] spirits? Two spirits. One that's trying
[1:29:52] to make you powerless and one that's
[1:29:54] trying to put you in action.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; One is trying to make you formal and
[1:29:58] lukewarm. One that's trying to make you
[1:30:00] on fire for the power of God and the
[1:30:02] love of God in your life.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; The word in action.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; The word lived.
[1:30:08] But if you can by God's spirit discern
[1:30:10] and withstand the Antichrist spirit,
[1:30:12] Satan will be powerless before her. He
[1:30:15] will be as definitely thwarted today as
[1:30:17] when Christ withtood his every effort to
[1:30:19] gain power over him in the desert. Yes,
[1:30:21] SATAN HATES REVELATION, BUT WE love it.
[1:30:23] For true revelation or I in our lives,
[1:30:25] THE GATES OF HELL CANNOT PREVAIL AGAINST
[1:30:28] US, BUT WE WILL PREVAIL over them. Amen.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; THIS CHURCH, THIS MARK 16:16 CHURCH IN
[1:30:36] ACTION WILL PREVAIL OVER THE GATES OF
[1:30:39] HELL.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; IT WILL PREVAIL OVER CANCER. IT WHAT
[1:30:43] DOES THE gates of HELL REPRESENT? THE
[1:30:45] GATES REPRESENTS EVERYTHING THAT'S
[1:30:47] BEHIND THE GATE.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; SO IF WE WE PREVAIL OVER THE GATES, we
[1:30:51] prevail over everything BEHIND THE
[1:30:53] GATES. THEREFORE, WE PREVAIL OVER
[1:30:55] SICKNESS, WE PREVAIL OVER HELL, WE
[1:30:57] PREVAIL OVER EVERY DEVIL, WE PREVAIL
[1:30:59] OVER DEATH ITSELF.
[1:31:02] WHY? CUZ WE ARE CHURCH IN ACTION,
[1:31:05] MARCHING IN STEP WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Paul said the word came in
[1:31:15] power as well as voice. The word
[1:31:18] preached will actually demonstrate
[1:31:21] itself.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; I've seen it happen preaching and people
[1:31:27] be healed right in the middle of it. Oh
[1:31:30] yeah.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Chains fall off right in the middle of
[1:31:32] we heard about all that Sunday, right?
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; What was what was we hearing? A church,
[1:31:37] the book of Acts, a continuation of the
[1:31:40] book of Acts.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, as we heard Sunday,
[1:31:44] God ain't finished yet.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; He's still got the pen and he's still
[1:31:52] writing the letters out. He's still
[1:31:54] finishing up the chapter. There's going
[1:31:56] to come a the end one of these days,
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; but it ain't going to be my the end.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I tell you whose the
[1:32:04] end is going to be. It's going to be the
[1:32:06] end to depression. It's going to be the
[1:32:08] end to fear. It's going to be the end to
[1:32:10] anxiety. It's going to be the end to
[1:32:12] every devil in hell. It's going to be
[1:32:14] the END TO SATAN, LUCIFER HIMSELF. BUT
[1:32:17] IT WILL NOT BE MY END. I'LL STILL BE IN
[1:32:20] ACTION.
[1:32:22] PRAISING GOD, giving him glory to his
[1:32:25] name.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word demonstrated is like a
[1:32:30] flaming cutting sword that'll cut right
[1:32:32] into the consciences of men like a
[1:32:34] surgeon's knife. It'll cut out diseases.
[1:32:37] It'll set captives free. Everywhere
[1:32:39] those early believers went, they went
[1:32:41] preaching the gospel word. And God
[1:32:43] confirmed the word with signs following.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; If you don't find yourself there, you're
[1:32:49] a false church.
[1:32:53] Right? The sick were healed. The devils
[1:32:56] cast out. THEY SPOKE A NEW TONGUE. THAT
[1:32:58] WAS THE WORD IN ACTION. THAT WORD HAS
[1:33:01] NEVER FAILED IN MOUTHS OF believing
[1:33:03] Christians.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me say it like this. It
[1:33:08] will never fail in mouths of believing
[1:33:10] Christians. And in this last age, it is
[1:33:13] weaker. It is less. NO, IT'S STRONGER.
[1:33:17] IT'S GREATER THAN EVER in the true word
[1:33:20] bride.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; So the actions is not going to get less.
[1:33:25] It's going to get greater.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; It's going to get so great. The action
[1:33:29] of the spirit of God in the people in
[1:33:32] people's life is going to get so great
[1:33:33] until this action takes over in these
[1:33:35] bodies as they're walking like a dead
[1:33:38] one step at a time. One day that step's
[1:33:40] going to step and the power is going to
[1:33:42] be there to meet them in the motion. It
[1:33:44] might feel like just a regular Monday
[1:33:45] morning, but on that Monday morning,
[1:33:47] Monday evening, Monday afternoon,
[1:33:48] whenever it is, THAT POWER IS GOING TO
[1:33:50] MEET YOU IN THAT MOTION. AND ONE STEP
[1:33:52] YOU'RE going to be in humanity, and the
[1:33:54] next step you're going to be IN ANOTHER
[1:33:56] DIMENSION, CHANGED FOREVER. NEVER TO GO
[1:33:59] BACK TO THAT AGAIN.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; NEVER TO GO BACK AND TAKE UP THE OLD BED
[1:34:03] OF HUMANITY, THE OLD BED OF OF
[1:34:06] DEPRESSION, THE OLD BED OF ANXIETIES AND
[1:34:08] FEARS, BUT WALK AWAY FROM it forever.
[1:34:13] FOREVER.
[1:34:15] GOD WANTS SOMEBODY IN action
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; to believe what his word says.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; He says, "Little flock, you little
[1:34:25] minority, hold on to the word. Fill your
[1:34:27] mouth and heart with it, and someday God
[1:34:30] will give you the kingdom.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; This last age is going to be stronger
[1:34:35] and greater."
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; So don't be looking for less, be looking
[1:34:41] for more.
[1:34:43] He ain't finished yet.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Is brother Jeremy here tonight? Okay.
[1:34:56] He ain't finished yet.
[1:34:59] God is looking for somebody that'll take
[1:35:03] his word
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; and put it into action.
[1:35:11] You're sitting in a building tonight.
[1:35:13] We've told the testimony of it many
[1:35:15] times, but you're putting sitting in a
[1:35:17] building because a man heard something
[1:35:20] more than a heard something more than a
[1:35:23] a little sick man laid on a bed.
[1:35:26] But he saw God meet him in the motion.
[1:35:31] As he would walk there into that
[1:35:33] hospital, he would text me and he said,
[1:35:35] "I'm going in to pray for brother Gary."
[1:35:38] said, ' Don't forget, Dad. I just was
[1:35:39] just reading that. Me and my family were
[1:35:41] just reading in the book of Acts. Said,
[1:35:42] "Don't forget. We're writing a new new
[1:35:44] book of Acts. We're the continuation.
[1:35:46] Another book of Acts. We're the
[1:35:48] continuation."
[1:35:50] He'd walk in there and he would hear
[1:35:51] this man begin to express things about
[1:35:53] wants and desires. And God came down and
[1:35:57] the power met them in the motion. And
[1:36:00] you're sitting now in the very visible
[1:36:03] form of that power
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; that gave us this place that we didn't
[1:36:07] even have to go to a bank and borrow a
[1:36:08] dime.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; If God could do that about a building,
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; don't you think he can do that about
[1:36:17] your son,
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; about your daughter, about your body,
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; about your mind, about your spirit,
[1:36:23] about whatever you're going through?
[1:36:25] This God will meet you in the motion.
[1:36:28] Amen.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Walk in his word. Live in his word. And
[1:36:32] he's going to meet you there.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts.
[1:36:41] The word in action.
[1:36:44] Stretch forth thy hand.
[1:36:47] Hey, God. It's withered. It hurts. He
[1:36:49] didn't ask you if it hurts.
[1:36:53] He just said, stretch it out.
[1:36:57] He didn't ask you to give a 10-page
[1:37:00] report on all the doctor said and all
[1:37:02] this said and all that. All what your
[1:37:03] emotions says and what what what all
[1:37:05] your symptoms say. No, I'm not
[1:37:07] interested. Stretch forth thy hand.
[1:37:11] Rise up and walk. Step out of the boat.
[1:37:16] Go show yourself to the priest.
[1:37:19] Lift your hands. Moses
[1:37:23] actions.
[1:37:28] Not thoughts, not excuses,
[1:37:30] not well, I ain't got nobody to take me
[1:37:32] to the water. I some as soon as I try,
[1:37:34] somebody gets in front of me. It ain't
[1:37:37] about that.
[1:37:39] It's about rise up, take up your bed,
[1:37:42] and walk.
[1:37:45] It's an action.
[1:37:51] It's the day. It's the moment. It's the
[1:37:54] time. It's the moment that God can meet
[1:37:57] you in the motion. He can meet you in
[1:38:00] the action. He can meet you and show you
[1:38:04] what you thought was impossible is
[1:38:06] possible.
[1:38:08] What you thought was not even no way.
[1:38:10] There's no human human way it could ever
[1:38:13] happen. God's not taking human equation
[1:38:17] in he's not taking humanity into the
[1:38:18] equation. Matter of fact, he takes it
[1:38:21] out of the equation
[1:38:23] because God does impossible math
[1:38:27] and he comes in. He just needs you to
[1:38:31] take a step. Maybe you feel like it's up
[1:38:34] to your almost up to your nose. Take
[1:38:36] another step.
[1:38:38] What if I step in that old stormy river?
[1:38:40] What's going to happen? God will meet
[1:38:41] you there if you're following his word.
[1:38:45] Brother Timothy, I don't know. I got so
[1:38:47] many things going on. I got so many
[1:38:49] situations. I got so many struggles. I I
[1:38:51] don't quit dwelling on that.
[1:38:55] Quit looking at that.
[1:38:59] Go into action. And the true action of a
[1:39:02] Christian is the word of God.
[1:39:07] That is the only action.
[1:39:11] That's the motion you want. That's the
[1:39:13] way you need to go. That's the What did
[1:39:16] he say? Seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:39:19] and all these things will be given to
[1:39:21] you.
[1:39:22] Many people want this all the things and
[1:39:24] then they're going to seek the king.
[1:39:25] That ain't how it works. Seek you first
[1:39:27] the kingdom. It's an action.
[1:39:30] But when you seek him with your whole
[1:39:32] heart, then God will give you the
[1:39:34] desires of your heart.
[1:39:36] God will meet you in the motion.
[1:39:43] How many just say, "Lord, I I just want
[1:39:45] to take you at your word tonight.
[1:39:48] I want to take you at your word.
[1:39:52] Give it all to you, Jesus."
[1:39:56] Maybe we just sing that I surrender all.
[1:40:01] Maybe I just invite you to do what God
[1:40:03] told Moses to do. Just lift up your
[1:40:06] hands
[1:40:08] as a sign of surrender and say, "Lord, I
[1:40:11] surrender it all.
[1:40:14] All
[1:40:18] all
[1:40:20] to thee, my blessed
[1:40:25] Savior,
[1:40:27] I
[1:40:29] surrender.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; He'll meet you in the action in the
[1:40:31] motion. Oh, I surrender.
[1:40:35] Oh, I
[1:40:38] surrender
[1:40:40] all.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; I surrender my thoughts. I surrender my
[1:40:43] feelings. I I surrender what I think.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; I surrender.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; I lay myself down as a sheep
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; before the master.
[1:40:52] Oh, all
[1:40:55] to thee, my blessed
[1:41:00] Savior,
[1:41:02] I
[1:41:04] surren.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, I surrender all.
[1:41:10] Oh, I I surrender.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I give it to you all.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:41:20] I
[1:41:22] surrender
[1:41:25] all
[1:41:30] to thee.
[1:41:33] Let every
[1:41:39] surrender.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. All to Jesus I surrender.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; And all
[1:41:47] to Jesus
[1:41:50] I
[1:41:52] surrender
[1:41:53] to you. All
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; to him he freely give. I freely
[1:42:00] give.
[1:42:02] I
[1:42:04] will ever
[1:42:07] love
[1:42:08] and trust him. Walking in his word, his
[1:42:13] presence.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, I surrender all. Oh, I
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; I
[1:42:21] surrender
[1:42:24] all.
[1:42:27] Oh, I
[1:42:29] surrender
[1:42:32] all.
[1:42:36] All
[1:42:38] to thee, my blessed
[1:42:42] Savior.
[1:42:45] I
[1:42:46] surrender
[1:42:48] all.
[1:42:53] I
[1:42:55] surrender
[1:42:57] all.
[1:43:00] Oh, I
[1:43:03] surrender
[1:43:05] all.
