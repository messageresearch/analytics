[42:40] amen
[42:42] amen let's turn to nahum chapter 1.
[42:53] like to speak to you tonight on the
[42:54] light
[42:56] who can contend
[42:59] amen
[43:00] chapter 1
[43:02] and verse 2. god is jealous
[43:05] and the lord revengeth
[43:08] and the lord revengeth
[43:10] and is furious the lord will take
[43:13] vengeance on his adversary
[43:16] and he reserveth wrath
[43:19] for his enemies
[43:20] the lord is slow to anger but great in
[43:23] power
[43:25] and he will not at all acquit the wicked
[43:28] the lord hath his way in the whirlwind
[43:31] and then the storm
[43:33] and the clouds are the dust of his feet
[43:36] he rebuketh the sea and maketh the dry
[43:39] he drieth up all the rivers
[43:41] beishan languisheth
[43:43] carmel and the flower of lebanon
[43:45] languisheth
[43:46] the mountains quake at him
[43:49] and the hills melt
[43:51] and the earth is burned at his presence
[43:54] yea the world and all that dwell therein
[43:58] who
[43:59] can stand
[44:00] before his indignation
[44:03] and who
[44:04] can abide in the fierceness of his anger
[44:07] his fury is poured out like fire and the
[44:11] rocks are thrown down by him
[44:13] but the lord is good
[44:15] a stronghold in the day of trouble and
[44:19] he knoweth him that trust in him
[44:23] amen god bless you today
[44:25] to be seated
[44:29] the light
[44:31] who can contend
[44:34] it's pretty amazing scripture as we read
[44:37] in the first
[44:38] few lines he would speak over and over
[44:40] of a god
[44:42] who revengeth
[44:43] a god who is furious
[44:46] a god who takes vengeance a god who
[44:49] reserveth wrath
[44:50] but he said he's slow to anger
[44:53] amen but once he gets there look out
[44:56] amen once he gets to that great pla
[44:58] place of anger and and that he it comes
[45:01] in great power
[45:03] and not he said it will not at all
[45:05] acquit the wicked
[45:07] but the lord will have his way in the
[45:09] whirlwind and the storms and the clouds
[45:11] and he rebukes we'll reap the sea and
[45:14] make it dry the mountains will quake the
[45:16] hills will melt the earth will burn just
[45:19] at his presence
[45:21] amen and he goes on to say who can stand
[45:25] before his indignation
[45:28] or who can contend who can stand who can
[45:31] abide who can contend in the fierceness
[45:34] of his anger his fury is poured out like
[45:37] fire and the rocks are thrown down by
[45:40] him so amen as we read here amen the
[45:43] wicked or our enemy the devil is not
[45:46] going to get away with anything
[45:48] but he is going to pay for all that he
[45:51] has done
[45:52] but but during all of this the lord is a
[45:55] good god and he's a stronghold in the
[45:58] day of trouble and i believe that's the
[45:59] time that we're living in we're living
[46:01] in a great day of trouble and he also
[46:03] knows them that trust in him now i was
[46:06] looking at this word contend it means to
[46:09] strive it means to vie for
[46:12] a win or in a contest or a rivalry or it
[46:16] means to strive or win against
[46:19] difficulties it also means to play to
[46:22] win
[46:23] amen in other words if i'm not going to
[46:24] win i'm not going to play amen that's my
[46:27] attitude i'm going to win so amen god
[46:30] has this attitude towards amen the time
[46:33] that we're living in he's going to win
[46:35] he's not going to lose he's going to win
[46:37] the war he's going to win the the time
[46:40] that we're living in he's going to win
[46:42] amen every heart that belongs to him
[46:44] they are going to be his and when it
[46:46] comes down to the end because he's not
[46:48] going to give up in other words god is
[46:50] not in this toulouse
[46:54] amen this light is contending against
[46:56] the darkness it is holding it back it is
[46:59] telling darkness you can only come so
[47:02] far as we heard in the song amen you
[47:04] cannot cross the bloodline you can only
[47:07] go so far you can only do so much just
[47:10] so as he would tell job when job would
[47:12] come or when the uh the
[47:14] satan would come before the sons of god
[47:16] as they would present themselves and he
[47:18] would say have you considered my servant
[47:20] job and he said yeah but you do this you
[47:22] got a hedge around him he said i'll take
[47:24] all of this away amen you can do
[47:27] whatever you want to him but you cannot
[47:29] take his life in other words he puts
[47:31] something there that devil the devil can
[47:33] only go so far amen the devil is only is
[47:38] harnessed in the harnesses put on him by
[47:41] god therefore he can only do so much he
[47:44] can only put so much on you he can only
[47:46] uh pressure you so much he can only put
[47:49] sickness on you so much he can only
[47:52] torment you so much he can only go so
[47:54] far amen but there's a line there that
[47:57] he cannot cross and therefore who can
[48:00] stand against this great god that we're
[48:02] talking about this god is a great god
[48:05] it's a great light nothing can stand
[48:07] against it you know there was a there
[48:08] was an army one time that thought they
[48:10] could stand against it and they thought
[48:12] they could put enough men around a tomb
[48:14] and they thought they could put enough
[48:16] garrison there and they could hold it
[48:18] they hold that body in a tomb but they
[48:19] found out on that resurrection morning
[48:22] when that light of god came down amen
[48:24] and it blinded all them around and it
[48:27] put them as though they were dead men
[48:29] amen they found out there was not a
[48:31] match for this life amen we can go on
[48:34] into the into the acts and we can see
[48:36] peter when he was thrown in prison and
[48:38] he was held there by guards and he had
[48:40] guards sitting around him guards at the
[48:42] door but the bible said prayer was
[48:44] offered up unto god without cease in
[48:47] other words they kept praying that god
[48:49] would somehow set this man free and
[48:52] their prayers went before the throne of
[48:53] god and god sent down an angel which the
[48:56] scripture said a great light shone in
[48:59] the prison and those that held him and
[49:01] those that tried to keep him there could
[49:03] know they lost their power to hold they
[49:05] lost their power and their ability to
[49:08] keep him in the prison and the angel
[49:10] smote him and said get up and let's walk
[49:12] out of here and i think about that as we
[49:14] look in times of where we're around and
[49:17] people that are caught in prisons of of
[49:19] sin and prisons of unbelief and prisons
[49:22] of fear amen if you'd begin to pray and
[49:24] the church of god will begin to call
[49:26] upon god or maybe they're imprisoned of
[49:28] sickness but if the church of god will
[49:30] begin to call without ceasing and begin
[49:32] to pray god will send the light that is
[49:35] greater than that sin that is greater
[49:37] than that sickness that is greater than
[49:39] whatever is holding them and an angel
[49:42] can step out and say come on it's time
[49:44] to walk out of this place

[50:10] we would hold that faith there is a
[50:12] light greater than that cancer and that
[50:15] cancer cannot contend against that light
[50:18] in other words it can't stand in the
[50:20] presence of that light amen one thing we
[50:22] find out about this light it never quits
[50:26] amen just as the sun never quits shining
[50:29] but every morning it comes up again to
[50:31] herald a new day and it begins to push
[50:33] back the darkness so does the son of god

[1:01:05] gave all diligence to write unto you of
[1:01:07] the common salvation
[1:01:09] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:01:11] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[1:01:14] what
[1:01:15] contend
[1:01:17] for the faith which were once delivered
[1:01:19] unto the saints
[1:01:20] that you should earnestly or vehemently
[1:01:23] or very wholeheartedly brother brennan
[1:01:25] was saying with all your heart content
[1:01:27] he said not for a faith
[1:01:30] but for the faith
[1:01:32] the same faith jesus would speak and he
[1:01:35] would go out and he would do and he
[1:01:37] would move and do mighty miracles he
[1:01:39] would preach the word this is the faith
[1:01:41] that we are to contend for he said well
[1:01:44] why has brother tim been preaching what
[1:01:45] he's been preaching because he is
[1:01:47] contending for the faith that was once
[1:01:50] delivered
[1:01:53] hey man this ain't a new faith this is
[1:01:55] the faith that we have went back to
[1:01:57] again amen there's the same church in
[1:01:59] the first age tall we teach as they
[1:02:02] preach we preach
[1:02:04] therefore if they heal we heal
[1:02:09] if people come out of prisons in that
[1:02:11] day people will come out of prison in
[1:02:13] this day
[1:02:18] we must contend
[1:02:21] i'm going to skip down because i i i
[1:02:24] don't feel like you
[1:02:25] quiet with me yet
[1:02:29] brother matt watkins shared this
[1:02:31] testimony
[1:02:33] back in march i was asked but we're
[1:02:35] talking about contending for the faith
[1:02:37] back in march i was asked by a brother
[1:02:39] in our church brother travis jackson's
[1:02:41] got a wonderful testimony of how god
[1:02:43] saved him and even his mother and dad's
[1:02:45] incredible incredible man of faith he
[1:02:48] said if i'd go if he asked if i would go
[1:02:50] with him to lay hands and pray
[1:02:52] for a good friend of his marcus humphrey
[1:02:55] who had been recently diagnosed with
[1:02:57] stage four hodgkin's lymphoma cancer
[1:03:04] he was told by the doctors he had a few
[1:03:06] months maybe to live
[1:03:09] marcus is the associate pastor of what
[1:03:11] they call a vineyard church here in
[1:03:13] beaufort it's an environment in
[1:03:15] evangelical church evangelical church he
[1:03:18] was brother travis's pastor before he
[1:03:20] came to the message more than 14 years
[1:03:22] ago
[1:03:24] so we went to his home where i could
[1:03:25] tell immediately he was very sick and he
[1:03:28] had a tumor the size of a large
[1:03:30] grapefruit on his neck
[1:03:32] and brother travis now listening to this
[1:03:34] contending for the faith
[1:03:36] amen brother draft brother travis told
[1:03:38] him that because of his death sentence
[1:03:40] there wasn't no time to mince words
[1:03:44] and to be bold and honest with him he
[1:03:46] shared his testimony of how the lord led
[1:03:48] him to the truth of the end time message
[1:03:51] into a living god who is not just was
[1:03:53] alive he's still alive and he's living
[1:03:56] among his people he boldly declared to
[1:03:58] him the true jesus wasn't living in a
[1:04:01] denominational church amongst fox
[1:04:03] doctrines like trinity but that god had
[1:04:06] been revealed himself again in the last
[1:04:08] days to a prophet and restored the
[1:04:11] original apostolic gospel with apostolic
[1:04:15] power to heal the sick and raise the
[1:04:18] dead
[1:04:19] [Applause]
[1:04:21] he shared that this was a fulfillment of
[1:04:23] scripture marcus was very receptive and
[1:04:26] so i'm sure anyone told me what months
[1:04:28] to live would be he told us that he when
[1:04:31] we walked to the door the lord spoke to
[1:04:33] him and said we were sent from god
[1:04:37] and you want to know where the book of
[1:04:38] acts are it's happening all amongst us
[1:04:42] i began to testify to him about sister
[1:04:45] atlanta butts and how she was
[1:04:47] supernaturally healed of
[1:04:49] the exact stage four hodgkin's lymphoma
[1:04:52] i showed him the image of her pet scans
[1:04:55] before and after
[1:04:58] well why was it he that was contending
[1:05:01] against her
[1:05:02] he turned and began to contend against
[1:05:05] him
[1:05:06] give me some more brother tim his faith
[1:05:08] began to rise as he wept here hearing
[1:05:11] about about a living god we then laid
[1:05:14] hands on him with his wife and other
[1:05:16] people in the church in the room from
[1:05:18] the church and we prayed for him that
[1:05:20] god was supernaturally deliver him and
[1:05:22] healing of this cancer demon that was
[1:05:25] killing him we just received the report
[1:05:27] from his wife after a special visit this
[1:05:30] hospital earlier this week all in caps
[1:05:35] praise the living god marcus has been
[1:05:38] supernaturally healed and is a hundred
[1:05:40] percent cancer-free
[1:05:52] hallelujah the doctor said it was the
[1:05:54] most aggressive cancer he had ever seen
[1:05:57] but now it's miraculously gone the
[1:06:00] doctor cried and said this is truly a
[1:06:03] miracle
[1:06:05] he is still the same yesterday today and
[1:06:07] forever he said be in prayer because
[1:06:09] we're seeing him later in his home to
[1:06:11] follow up and to continue witnessing to
[1:06:14] him about the message of the hour
[1:06:18] and i say this if god could come down in
[1:06:22] a hall and heal a man preaching half
[1:06:24] truth
[1:06:29] hallelujah why don't we also contend
[1:06:32] that the same god can heal a man who
[1:06:35] preaches all the truth
[1:06:40] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:06:42] forever i refuse to back up
[1:06:55] hallelujah

[1:10:47] that the scripture is true
[1:10:49] [Applause]
[1:10:51] we contend that it hasn't lost one
[1:10:54] moment of power
[1:10:55] but it's still the same as when they
[1:10:57] went to the gate called beautiful and
[1:10:59] they grabbed the lame man and said
[1:11:01] silver and gold have our nun but such as
[1:11:04] i have give unto thee in the name of
[1:11:07] jesus rise up and walk
[1:11:10] jesus

[1:11:32] of jesus he's gonna make a way where
[1:11:34] there seems to be no way
[1:11:44] in the name of jesus
[1:11:46] healing is here in the name of jesus you
[1:11:50] don't have to live another moment under
[1:11:52] that complex that you don't belong you
[1:11:55] are here because you belong
[1:11:57] [Applause]
[1:12:00] thank you jesus you were here because
[1:12:03] god called you to be here
[1:12:08] [Music]
[1:12:20] hallelujah
[1:12:30] let's just worship him uh
[1:12:33] this is his service it ain't mine
[1:12:38] some of y'all need to start contending
[1:12:40] against that devil that said your son
[1:12:43] and your daughter is not coming back
[1:12:45] [Applause]
[1:12:47] some of you need to start contending
[1:12:48] against that mountain of fear and that
[1:12:51] mountain of doubt and that mountain of
[1:12:53] unbelief some of you need to start
[1:12:54] contending you say how am i supposed to
[1:12:56] the word of god is naive and it's a
[1:12:59] sharp threshing instrument you need to
[1:13:01] start using it and start speaking
[1:13:03] against your enemy and say devil i'm not
[1:13:06] going to be held another service under
[1:13:08] this thing i'm not going to be held
[1:13:09] another moment but i'm going to speak
[1:13:11] the word and i'm walking out of my
[1:13:13] prison cell
[1:13:27] hallelujah
[1:13:29] we need to contend he's not a god of
[1:13:31] history
[1:13:33] but he's a god of the now
[1:13:35] for this moment what he did then he
[1:13:37] still does because he's the same yet
[1:13:40] today yesterday and forever he's still
[1:13:42] the same god and he changes not brother
[1:13:44] remember said my contention is my
[1:13:47] ministry is to contend that jesus christ
[1:13:50] the son of god is not dead
[1:13:54] his body is now sitting on the throne of
[1:13:57] god in glory but a spirit that was in
[1:14:00] him is now in the church
[1:14:04] and it's moving among his people that's
[1:14:06] according to the word
[1:14:09] i say holy spirit move unto every wall
[1:14:13] comes down move onto every complex swing
[1:14:17] move until there's no more fear among us
[1:14:21] move until we can get some men that'll
[1:14:24] draw a sword and say i'm going to get a
[1:14:26] drink for my kids
[1:14:28] [Applause]
[1:14:33] amen i got in my notes i'm just going to
[1:14:35] preach it amen brother branham said that
[1:14:37] there was a david he got him some
[1:14:39] gentile warriors around him
[1:14:43] [Music]
[1:14:44] he was an outcast he had been put out of
[1:14:46] the economy of god he'd been but he had
[1:14:48] been anointed to be king and he said
[1:14:51] those men saw a great light
[1:14:54] they saw an anointing there and they
[1:14:56] began to move around that anointing
[1:14:59] and one day that anointing was caught up
[1:15:01] somewhere and he got so thirsty he said
[1:15:03] i want a drink
[1:15:05] and i don't want just any drink i want a
[1:15:08] drink from bethlehem wales i want to
[1:15:11] drink where the fresh water of god's
[1:15:14] been spewing out
[1:15:17] i want a drink where jacob drug dug a
[1:15:20] well
[1:15:21] [Applause]
[1:15:23] he was contending that was his will
[1:15:26] well everybody by three men said you
[1:15:28] know what we're gonna go get him a drink
[1:15:30] and he said it was garrison by about 16
[1:15:32] miles of philistine but two grabbed a
[1:15:35] sword and one grabbed a bucket
[1:15:39] said let's go get our king a drink and
[1:15:42] they begin to fight through doubt and
[1:15:44] fear and from complexes
[1:15:50] they brought through cancer and they
[1:15:52] caught fought through every kind of
[1:15:53] thing that said they couldn't make it
[1:15:56] said they might as well give up and go
[1:15:57] home
[1:16:00] but on this wednesday night
[1:16:02] their king wanted a drink
[1:16:04] he wanted a drink of that brother
[1:16:06] brandon would call that old pentecostal
[1:16:08] wallet
[1:16:10] something that's flowing something
[1:16:12] that's got life in it something that's
[1:16:14] moving something that might have a
[1:16:16] little shout in it
[1:16:19] something that might have a little dance
[1:16:21] here
[1:16:22] something that's moving and that was
[1:16:24] enough to make three gentile warriors
[1:16:28] fight
[1:16:29] contend against them uncircumcised
[1:16:32] philistine it says this well is not your
[1:16:35] will
[1:16:38] you philistine says we can't drink from
[1:16:40] that well no more i'm going to cut your
[1:16:42] head off
[1:16:43] euphelistina says amen the baptism the
[1:16:45] holy ghost ain't the same today i'm
[1:16:47] going to cut your head off
[1:16:50] you philistine that says days of
[1:16:52] miracles are passed i'm going to cut
[1:16:54] your head off
[1:16:57] you philistine that says god don't heal
[1:16:59] no more your head's coming off
[1:17:03] you philistine that says god doesn't
[1:17:05] save it and alter no more i'm cutting
[1:17:08] your head off
[1:17:10] you philistine that says i'm not going
[1:17:13] to give back my son i'm not gonna give
[1:17:16] back your daughter i'm cutting your head
[1:17:19] off
[1:17:25] and i'm gonna dip down in that well
[1:17:28] and i'm gonna bring him back a drink
[1:17:30] tonight
[1:17:32] i'm gonna dip down in the well and i'm
[1:17:34] gonna bring my king a drink
[1:17:43] they did not fall they didn't just fight
[1:17:44] their way there they fought their way
[1:17:46] back
[1:17:46] [Applause]
[1:17:48] one hole in the bucket two holding
[1:17:50] swords
[1:17:59] and after a minute
[1:18:00] they got to that last one
[1:18:06] a demon of fear
[1:18:09] he picked a dumb place to show up
[1:18:13] at the last stop
[1:18:15] fear more than everywhere fear more than
[1:18:18] any time fear more than anxieties and
[1:18:21] every kind of supernatural demon being
[1:18:23] but there's a group of people has been
[1:18:25] armed with a new threshing weapon
[1:18:30] satan
[1:18:31] this weapon's got teeth
[1:18:34] it cuts going and it cuts coming
[1:18:37] it'll cut one way and it'll cut another
[1:18:39] way it'll take your way to divine
[1:18:42] healing and it'll cut its way to the
[1:18:43] holy ghost
[1:18:46] it'll cut its way to an office hall
[1:18:48] it'll cut its way into a prayer line
[1:18:52] i don't care how many philistines say
[1:18:54] god don't do that no more we are here to
[1:18:58] cut their head off
[1:19:00] and if you're hearing this tonight you
[1:19:02] need to grab your sword and go to swing
[1:19:04] it and get yourself out of that
[1:19:06] philistine camp
[1:19:15] get your way out of that unbelief get
[1:19:17] your way out of trees involvement and
[1:19:19] get a drink
[1:19:28] brother branham stood night after night
[1:19:30] contending for the faith
[1:19:32] [Applause]
[1:19:34] contending he's the same yesterday
[1:19:36] contending he's the same today and
[1:19:39] forever
[1:19:42] how dare us
[1:19:44] lay our swords down
[1:19:48] he stood against giants
[1:19:50] intellectual giants and said it ain't
[1:19:53] possible no more
[1:19:54] well it ain't possible till it's
[1:19:56] possible
[1:19:58] but when it's possible
[1:20:01] god makes it that way
[1:20:03] it wasn't possible for goliath to die
[1:20:06] but one day it became possible
[1:20:09] because there happened to be a little
[1:20:10] boy there in that camp that morning
[1:20:11] hadn't been there the 40 other days 39
[1:20:14] whatever it was but that morning he came
[1:20:16] with some meat and some cheese and some
[1:20:17] bread and he's gonna just feed a few
[1:20:19] brothers of his and his mind but the
[1:20:21] whole time the light was whirling
[1:20:24] it was leading him to the valley
[1:20:26] because again god wanted to show him
[1:20:28] he's not just god on the mountain with
[1:20:30] his sheep he's god down the valley where
[1:20:31] the giants are
[1:20:34] amen he brings him down to that valley
[1:20:36] and he hears a voice says send me a man
[1:20:41] brother adam said there was a different
[1:20:42] set of ears in the camp that day
[1:20:46] on that wednesday night there was a
[1:20:48] different set of ears
[1:20:51] said that devil i'm done listening to
[1:20:53] you
[1:20:55] i don't need another day of that
[1:20:57] i don't need five more minutes send me
[1:20:59] i'll go kill him
[1:21:04] this is what those gentile warriors saw
[1:21:06] in david they saw a man that was not
[1:21:08] afraid
[1:21:10] but his trust was in his god
[1:21:14] and tonight
[1:21:15] he's looking for another drink
[1:21:19] but will you fight through your
[1:21:20] complexes
[1:21:23] well
[1:21:24] brother timothy
[1:21:27] i'm just a quiet person
[1:21:30] yeah
[1:21:31] you ain't been close enough to the fire
[1:21:35] you get close enough to the fire
[1:21:37] it'll warm you
[1:21:38] and then it'll burn you
[1:21:44] and something reacts i don't care who
[1:21:46] you are how many have here been burned
[1:21:50] let me just hear for a moment what'd you
[1:21:52] sound like
[1:22:01] i know good and well and you didn't go
[1:22:03] mama i burned myself
[1:22:07] i'm so sad
[1:22:10] no there was a reaction
[1:22:12] there was something in you
[1:22:14] and i don't care i'm not trying to say
[1:22:16] you gotta scream and you gotta holler
[1:22:19] but when that fire gets close
[1:22:23] there has to be a worship come forth
[1:22:27] whether if it's just hands up and tears
[1:22:29] streaming down or you can't contain
[1:22:30] yourself and you take off running around
[1:22:32] whatever it is amen something's going to
[1:22:34] happen
[1:22:36] something's going to respond if there's
[1:22:38] life on the inside of you
[1:22:41] and tonight he's looking again for and
[1:22:43] i'm so far off my notes we just
[1:22:46] where he's looking again for somebody
[1:22:50] who's a somebody
[1:22:56] who's a somebody
[1:22:57] he said i don't care what's the matter
[1:22:59] tonight if you will believe for divine
[1:23:02] healing it's yours
[1:23:05] god promised you it and i wouldn't walk
[1:23:08] away from it
[1:23:10] i would take it he'd give it to you it's
[1:23:13] yours he'd give you the lair you might
[1:23:16] have to fight you might have to press
[1:23:18] you might have to push you might have to
[1:23:20] draw your sword but if you'll rise up
[1:23:23] you will possess it
[1:23:30] hallelujah how many possessions do we
[1:23:33] have here tonight
[1:23:34] i will possess everything that he has
[1:23:37] not partial no no no we're not going
[1:23:41] partially
[1:23:42] [Applause]
[1:23:44] oh yeah he says right here he said there
[1:23:46] was a lot of them that came at cades
[1:23:48] barnea and they refused to contend
[1:23:51] they said why was it he said it was a
[1:23:53] bunch of borderline but a bunch of
[1:23:54] borderline preachers
[1:23:58] that would get right up to the border
[1:24:00] line and say we can't do it
[1:24:03] we can't have that no more
[1:24:05] god don't move that way no more
[1:24:08] god don't do that no more
[1:24:10] god
[1:24:11] he
[1:24:12] ain't the same anymore you might as well
[1:24:13] say it
[1:24:17] don't say everything but that but that's
[1:24:19] what they're saying he's not the same
[1:24:24] and they go right up to the borderline
[1:24:26] and they'll scratch their toe in the
[1:24:28] dirt and he'll jump back over and he'll
[1:24:30] jump back over here and he gets a little
[1:24:32] bit too hot for him and they jump back
[1:24:33] over
