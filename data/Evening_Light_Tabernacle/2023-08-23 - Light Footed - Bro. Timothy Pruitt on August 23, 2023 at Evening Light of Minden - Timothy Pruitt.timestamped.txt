[44:40] speaking about if you you can put this
[44:42] in your mind it wasn't what we have
[44:44] today he didn't have a Q being back in
[44:46] that day or or some great Street lamp
[44:49] out there or something or something that
[44:51] would illuminate a whole stadium but
[44:53] they had little lamps that would they
[44:54] would put in some little cruise that was
[44:57] a little small vessel and they would put
[44:59] in it all and now that oil they would
[45:00] lay a wick it would come out and they'd
[45:03] kind of learn to squeeze I was looking
[45:04] at them today they would learn to
[45:05] squeeze one end of it to where the the
[45:08] wick could lay out the end and they
[45:10] would light it because that Wick would
[45:12] pull that oil up and that was what gave
[45:14] the light but these lamps that David was
[45:16] speaking of was not the bright beams of
[45:18] light we have today but it was a light
[45:21] that they used in that day and it would
[45:23] give out the light enough for each step
[45:26] for each step and as you would move one
[45:29] step it would illuminate the next step
[45:31] that's how God is you know he don't
[45:33] always tell you how everything's going
[45:35] to work out or how everything in between
[45:37] you're coming out and you're going in is
[45:39] going to be but he gives a word or a
[45:42] lamp to light up every step so that you
[45:45] can be with you can have assurance that
[45:47] when you put your foot on something that
[45:49] is solid and it won't slip amen little
[45:53] light in this lamp will light your way
[45:55] to Deliverance it may not light up the
[45:57] whole path where you see it see it
[45:59] actually all the things take place and
[46:01] how you're going to get there but it
[46:03] will light your way up to Deliverance it
[46:06] will light your way up to heal him it'll
[46:08] light your way up to the Holy Ghost
[46:10] it'll light your way to the body change
[46:12] one step at a time amen you may not know
[46:15] what it's all in front of you but you
[46:17] just keep on walking and as you walk it
[46:20] will be revealed unto you amen because
[46:22] this light has enough light for every
[46:25] step that you take but Brandon would use
[46:27] this and he said Thy word is a lamp unto
[46:30] my feet and to my path and you say well
[46:32] brother random I don't understand it all
[46:34] he said neither do I but I believe it
[46:37] and I know that that light is going to
[46:39] shine for me when I have need of it amen
[46:41] you know he's he's in this place he's
[46:43] telling them a story of being into in
[46:45] Kentucky somewhere and and there was
[46:48] this lady that came up a little
[46:49] barefooted girl and maybe about 15 years
[46:51] old and she had a little baby that had
[46:53] to pause him and he said what's the
[46:55] matter with the baby and said well she's
[46:56] got the jerks and she didn't know what
[46:58] to call it you know she didn't know the
[47:00] medical term but he said the little
[47:02] thing probably never had a pair of shoes
[47:03] on in her life some man's darling long
[47:05] hair hanging down I said Do you believe
[47:07] and she said yes sir I sure do believe
[47:10] and I looked at that baby and I took it
[47:12] and while I was praying it quit jerking
[47:15] and went out and the next day I was up
[47:17] squirrel hunting and over on the side of
[47:19] the mountain I heard some men sitting
[47:20] there talking and a saw got to buzzing
[47:23] and I slipped down out of where I was
[47:24] hunting and I've been squirrel hunting
[47:26] and I I I walked down to where they was
[47:28] at and he said I realized they was
[47:30] talking about me and they were sitting
[47:32] there too with the chew of tobacco
[47:33] spitting leaves are flying like that and
[47:35] they were talking about that baby that
[47:37] was prayed for and he said one of them
[47:39] said I've seen that baby and I went by
[47:41] there this morning and it's not jerking
[47:43] yet this morning said whatever that was
[47:45] that was real
[47:47] hey and so they had rifles leaning
[47:49] against the tree he said so I thought I
[47:51] better make myself known you know and
[47:52] said I I they had feuds down in that
[47:55] area he said so I walked up and I said
[47:57] good morning brother and a good fella

[48:01] chew at the back in his mouth and out
[48:03] out the side of you know coming out
[48:04] spitting in the in the and the leaves
[48:07] there and swallowing it and carrying
[48:08] home and uh and all of a sudden he
[48:11] looked around though and he seen brother
[48:12] Branham standing there and it reached up
[48:15] and got his hat off and jerked it off
[48:17] because he recognized who he was and he
[48:19] swallowed that O2 at the back and said
[48:21] good morning Parson he said respect
[48:24] that's right how are you ever gonna how
[48:25] he ever lived over it I don't know but
[48:28] he did but he said you know the next
[48:30] night coming back there was a man that
[48:32] wanted to argue with me with what had
[48:34] happened and he said he went to a church
[48:36] that didn't believe in Divine Healing
[48:37] and it was a Methodist Church there in
[48:39] white Hill Kentucky as he was standing
[48:42] outside he had a lantern in his hand and
[48:44] he said I want to say something preacher
[48:46] I just can't accept it because I can't
[48:48] see it I said you can't see it he said
[48:51] no I'm a sick man myself but I just
[48:53] can't see heal him I just can't see
[48:56] where God can do it I said where do you
[48:58] live and he said well back over there
[48:59] somewhere and said well now how are you
[49:01] going to get home well I'm going to walk
[49:02] home can you see your way home no sir I
[49:05] said yep it's an awful dark night
[49:06] tonight and cloudy and no moon out and
[49:09] said yes how are you going to get home
[49:10] he said buy this Lantern I said the
[49:12] lantern doesn't show light all the way
[49:14] to the house
[49:16] amen I said how do you how do you go he
[49:19] said I will walk by the lantern I said
[49:21] that's it you've got to walk got the
[49:24] light of the lantern now and every time
[49:26] you step this way the light will keep
[49:29] showing right ahead of you amen if you
[49:32] just keep walking the light will keep
[49:34] going with you
[49:36] Hallelujah and do and you do that this
[49:39] morning he said if you want Christ the
[49:41] great high priest the intercessor for
[49:43] your sickness or disease or or for your
[49:46] soul you may not understand it or but
[49:48] we're commanded to walk in the light as
[49:51] he is alive and you make one step in the
[49:54] light and when you get to that light
[49:56] when you got that light with you the
[49:58] light will shine all the way to perfect
[50:00] day amen so that's how it is it isn't
[50:03] that we can see all the way from here to
[50:06] our healing or all the week from here to
[50:08] our deliverance but we got the light
[50:10] with us and the light is going to lead
[50:12] us and it's going to guide us and it's
[50:14] going to be with us because his word
[50:16] promised it he said I'll never leave you
[50:17] or forsake you so if you take one step
[50:20] it's going to illuminate the next step
[50:21] and you're gonna have enough Faith to
[50:23] take the next step and you're going to
[50:24] keep walking until one day you walk into
[50:27] your healing or one day you're walking
[50:29] the holy ghost or one day you walk into
[50:31] your body change amen and I believe
[50:34] that's the way it is happening this word
[50:36] is a illuminated a group of people amen
[50:39] it may not illuminate and tell us what
[50:40] year he's coming or or what day it's

[53:18] not determine whether you die or whether
[53:20] you live the light determines that
[53:23] Hallelujah God is the light and you know
[53:26] I found as I was looking at this and now
[53:28] we know this story and I just want to
[53:30] bring it back to your members God's
[53:32] light is a light to his people but his
[53:35] Darkness to their enemy

[53:42] forewarn you get your shoes on
[53:47] this ain't the service to kick back and

[53:55] angel of God which went before the camp
[53:57] of Israel moved and went behind them and
[54:00] the pillar of cloud went from before
[54:01] their face and stood between them behind
[54:04] them and it came between the camp of the
[54:07] Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it
[54:09] was a cloud and darkness to them but it
[54:12] gave light by night to these so that no
[54:15] one came near one of the other all the
[54:18] night
[54:19] Hallelujah this angel of God is your
[54:22] light but it's a Darkness to your enemy
[54:24] he knows how to give you light but he
[54:26] knows how to confuse your enemy he knows
[54:28] how to give you light but he knows how
[54:30] to defeat your enemy he knows how to
[54:32] give you light but he knows how to take
[54:34] your enemy down and bring him into the
[54:36] position and place he was called to be
[54:38] this light is Illuminating you but it's
[54:41] Darkness to your foe
[54:45] Hallelujah you know the devil usually
[54:48] starts that little flare brother Brown
[54:50] says but watch it he tries to cut off
[54:52] every move of God every time he'll do
[54:55] that and he's still the same devil uses
[54:58] the same techniques as he did in the old
[55:00] days still use them today if we can only
[55:02] read that Old Testament then we would
[55:04] learn the tactics of the devil and how
[55:06] he does it so we found out he had power
[55:09] and that power was death
[55:12] all right that powers of death but he
[55:15] had no power beyond that
[55:19] just death ends his power then beyond
[55:22] that but beyond death Faith sees God's
[55:26] Resurrection
[55:28] amen there's a light that carries on
[55:31] beyond death amen there's a light that
[55:33] illuminates the believer to believe
[55:35] there's something more than death
[55:38] come on now this Faith sees God's
[55:40] Resurrection after the faith after the
[55:43] devil's end of the power of death and
[55:46] he's finished and the devil can do no
[55:48] more but after death Faith sees a
[55:51] resurrection God of Resurrection That's
[55:54] The Power of Faith to believe and and he
[55:57] said when he says standing over behind
[55:58] the Dark Cloud that you can't see with
[56:00] your natural eyes but Faith directs you
[56:03] to look beyond the clouds
[56:07] come on now look behind the Dark Cloud
[56:10] and you will see you may not see it with
[56:12] your natural eye but faith is standing
[56:15] there to direct you to the god of
[56:17] Resurrection the God of all wisdom who
[56:19] is ordained your path and he's standing
[56:22] just behind every trial
[56:29] hmm
[56:31] this God is standing behind every trial
[56:35] he is trying to tell you tonight just
[56:38] keep walking
[56:39] The Next Step you don't know might be
[56:42] your victory
[56:43] The Next Step might be though it may be
[56:46] over with it may be done with he may be
[56:48] finished with but whatever you do don't
[56:51] stop
[56:53] keep walking keep moving towards it put
[56:56] a well body before you and begin to walk
[56:58] towards it
[57:02] Hallelujah amen so he says oh I love
[57:06] that don't you this God has ordained our
[57:09] path
[57:10] so if he's ordained it he's got enough
[57:12] to light it up
[57:13] he's got enough to lead you and guide
[57:15] you he's not going to let you fall off a
[57:16] cliff somewhere to know that Peter said
[57:19] that every trial's worth is worth more
[57:21] to us than gold for it's working he said
[57:23] every son that cometh to God he said you
[57:25] know it must be the scores or tried or
[57:27] chastised he said if you get a little
[57:28] heartache after you get born again a
[57:30] little trial to upset you somewhere and
[57:32] you run back into the world again it
[57:34] shows you wasn't a child to begin with
[57:36] you're an illegitimate child not a child
[57:38] of God but if a man once anchors his
[57:40] heart against the heart of Calvary all
[57:43] devils in hell will never Shake him no
[57:45] more he's there
[57:48] didn't mean you wouldn't have trials
[57:50] they mean you wouldn't have heartaches
[57:52] doesn't mean you wouldn't be tempted but
[57:54] you're there
[57:57] amen you're there amen it won't Shake
[58:00] him notice he can for he that cannot
[58:02] change stand chastisement it's an
[58:04] illegitimate child he claims God to be
[58:07] his father when he's not just tossed
[58:09] about by every wind of doctor not stable
[58:11] don't know where you're going double
[58:12] minded a lot of times double tongue and
[58:15] don't know where you're standing or what
[58:16] you're talking about then a man that's
[58:18] been born again of the spirit of God
[58:20] knows exactly where he's at
[58:28] see by faith he sees God no matter what
[58:32] he's in
[58:34] you may not see him with these eyes
[58:36] tonight but you can see him by the lamp
[58:40] by the faith amen listen this he said
[58:43] how that Faith confounded Pharaoh how
[58:46] Pharaoh raised up Joseph right in his
[58:47] castle fed him gave him the best made a
[58:50] good strong man Adam lived 120 years
[58:52] that devil raising up the child of God
[58:54] to do the work of God how God pulled the
[58:56] wool right over his eyes right at that
[58:58] time we find out that the children of
[59:00] Israel how that they were led into this
[59:02] trap no way at all ever to get through
[59:04] it dark there laid the Red Sea the
[59:07] mountains on either side Pharaoh's arms
[59:09] behind them thousand times thousands of
[59:11] armored men come chasing right up look
[59:13] like God LED them right into a trap you
[59:16] know we find out that God sometimes
[59:19] leads us into a great thing
[59:21] into it what looks like a trap or what
[59:24] looks like destruction but it is only to
[59:27] show his power and His glory to deliver
[59:29] us
[59:31] amen then we this is that what not what
[59:34] happened to them they didn't have enough
[59:35] light to know they was fixing to hit a
[59:37] Red Sea
[59:39] no the Red Sea just came before them
[59:41] they didn't realize it was happening
[59:43] until they got there
[59:44] amen amen but God already knew the Red
[59:48] Sea was there
[59:49] he already knew your sickness was there
[59:52] he already knew your trial was there he
[59:55] already knew your Temptation was there
[59:57] he already knows all about it he may not
[1:00:00] show you but he's given you the chance
[1:00:02] to show him you have the faith to
[1:00:04] believe no matter what's going on
[1:00:12] we find out
[1:00:15] we find out that he told him to take a
[1:00:17] staff in his hand and raise his hands
[1:00:19] and go forward and the pillar Fighters
[1:00:21] leave that great Shekinah Glory there in
[1:00:24] them was a form or a pillar fire going
[1:00:27] before them turned and went back behind
[1:00:29] to the Egyptians coming it became
[1:00:31] Darkness but it would give light to
[1:00:34] Israel he said the very Plan of
[1:00:36] Salvation of God when a man shuts his
[1:00:37] heart up against God's plan he becomes
[1:00:40] in darkness God is away his past finding
[1:00:43] out but when a man rejects light there's
[1:00:45] nothing else but Darkness same way it is
[1:00:47] now sent a friend of mine tonight when
[1:00:49] you spurn love you must stand in
[1:00:51] judgment no way out of it God gives you
[1:00:53] love first offers it to you first but
[1:00:55] you spurn it then it's judgment but
[1:00:57] notice the host of pharaoh who had seen
[1:01:00] the supernatural done but they just
[1:01:02] believed it and they shut up their
[1:01:05] compassion to it and they rejected it
[1:01:07] and they started out to even slay the
[1:01:09] ones that God was working with
[1:01:11] listen to this now a beautiful type of
[1:01:14] what's Happening Here in America though
[1:01:16] what is going to happen in America one
[1:01:18] of these days the very program that for
[1:01:20] years they've tried to tag them on all
[1:01:22] kinds of things call them crazy call
[1:01:24] them Holy Rollers all kinds of names
[1:01:27] they shut up their lights to them but
[1:01:29] thanks be to God the great Pillar of
[1:01:32] Fire is leading this church right on
[1:01:37] amen the very same light that made a
[1:01:39] path for Israel to walk in blinded the
[1:01:42] eyes of pharaoh the very same Waters of
[1:01:44] judgment that drowned the whole world
[1:01:46] saved Noah and his family
[1:01:49] the very holy ghost that you laugh at
[1:01:51] and make fun of and the power Divine
[1:01:53] Healing will take the church in a
[1:01:55] Rapture one day
[1:01:57] amen it'll take the church and the
[1:02:00] Rapture one day and leave you here to go
[1:02:02] through the judgments think of it what a
[1:02:04] day it'll be when you spurn the mercy
[1:02:06] and then Jesus said they'll say give us
[1:02:08] some of your oil and say go by and while
[1:02:10] they were gone to try to buy the
[1:02:12] bridegroom come
[1:02:17] he goes on down
[1:02:19] we get down to it here
[1:02:24] Moses went forth packing his rod and we
[1:02:28] find out the Red Sea opened because A
[1:02:30] Mighty Wind followed that fire
[1:02:34] that light of God when men walk in the
[1:02:36] light then the wind follows Jesus said
[1:02:39] Terry in Jerusalem to endure with power
[1:02:41] on high they waited for the light and
[1:02:43] the wind came amen they walked in the
[1:02:46] light to the wind began to blow just
[1:02:47] step in the light tonight if you're
[1:02:49] outside of Christ the winds will come
[1:02:51] back again like they were on the day of
[1:02:53] Pentecost just keep walking in the light
[1:02:55] he said notice the children of Israel

[1:03:25] bitterness
[1:03:27] and unbelief and your own ideas and in
[1:03:30] your own consciousness
[1:03:33] how do you think this service is going
[1:03:35] to go how you think tomorrow is going to
[1:03:37] be and how you can't he said don't worry
[1:03:39] about tomorrow leave it for yourself
[1:03:41] today has enough trouble let's worry
[1:03:43] about right now in this service

[1:04:23] come to shine light
[1:04:26] and it shines light on you and it
[1:04:28] illuminates things that ought not be
[1:04:30] there that's the time not to get mad
[1:04:32] about it that's the time to shake them
[1:04:33] off
[1:04:35] amen because God is enough
[1:04:37] thought of you amen you know if we quit
[1:04:40] looking at it as somebody studied this
[1:04:42] so they could take their sermon out of
[1:04:44] this maybe God anointed a man amen
[1:04:46] because he had you in his mind
[1:04:50] think about that
[1:04:52] amen that kind of turns a little
[1:04:53] different table on the devil and what he
[1:04:55] tries to tell in our minds he's so quick
[1:04:57] to minimize everything else and minimize
[1:05:00] the movement of the spirit move minimize
[1:05:01] the Vindication minimize the word and
[1:05:04] maximize our excuses
[1:05:07] amen and we've got all kind of excuse
[1:05:10] why I didn't get it here and why this
[1:05:12] didn't happen here and why this said I
[1:05:14] was preaching to the young people there
[1:05:15] in Ohio and I brought out the man who
[1:05:17] laid at the pool of Bethesda and he's
[1:05:19] laying there for 38 years he didn't have
[1:05:21] to lay there for 38 years but he's
[1:05:22] laughing you know why
[1:05:24] because he had excuses
[1:05:28] amen Jesus knew this and he comes to him
[1:05:30] and he asked him this question do you
[1:05:32] want to be healed now you'd think that
[1:05:34] would be an obvious answer to that
[1:05:36] because a man been laying there 38 years
[1:05:38] but what did he say he didn't say yes he
[1:05:40] didn't say no he said I I would but I
[1:05:44] have nobody to take me to the pool I
[1:05:46] would but I someone I try to get there
[1:05:49] somebody's already in the pool and I
[1:05:51] have no wonder all kinds of excuses
[1:05:53] begin to flow out of his life why I
[1:05:56] can't get it why it can't be why it
[1:05:58] ain't for me why this and why that amen
[1:06:01] take your wise out of it
[1:06:03] amen take your excuses out of it tonight
[1:06:06] and say God illuminate my life so I can
[1:06:09] shake off the heavy the burdens and
[1:06:11] shake off the things of this world and
[1:06:13] become light-footed walking in the
[1:06:15] lights
[1:06:20] walk in the light light-footed
[1:06:23] he said do you ever walk when you go
[1:06:25] down the street singing
[1:06:28] feel my way every day with love as I
[1:06:31] walk with the Heavenly Dove let me go
[1:06:33] all the while with a song and a smile
[1:06:36] feel my way every day with love
[1:06:39] wow do you ever walk like that
[1:06:42] light-footed
[1:06:43] well I remember the night
[1:06:45] when I first got saved
[1:06:47] went back to a little shed I never did
[1:06:50] pray in my life but I was going to write
[1:06:52] Jesus a letter and Tack it on a tree so
[1:06:54] he could find it I didn't know how to
[1:06:56] pray I thought he'd pass by that tree
[1:06:58] sometimes and he'd see my letter what a
[1:07:00] dirty guy was and how low down and how
[1:07:02] weren't worthy if he's a man he'd talk
[1:07:05] like a man but I I didn't know how to
[1:07:07] talk and I knelt down one day in an old
[1:07:09] grass sack on that old wet shed I began
[1:07:11] to pull my finger I said Mr Jesus would
[1:07:14] you come here just a minute I want to
[1:07:15] talk to you amen but he came
[1:07:19] that's the main thing he said I think if
[1:07:22] we'd quit rhyming our prayers and trying
[1:07:24] to tease somebody's ears and pray from
[1:07:26] the depths of our heart like an
[1:07:28] old-fashioned centered ought to repent
[1:07:30] and pray God will hear us
[1:07:32] too much of this put on Pharisee I told
[1:07:35] you the other day of Pharisee means an
[1:07:37] actor to put many a Pharisees quit
[1:07:39] putting on
[1:07:41] quit putting all I don't like that stuff

[1:07:49] what you are anyhow

[1:08:03] remember when the Lord forgive me I felt
[1:08:07] like a million pounds went off of my
[1:08:09] back and I never even touched a step
[1:08:12] going towards the house I don't know

[1:22:12] time God moved Among Us he said listen
[1:22:15] he said when the Great Shepherd was
[1:22:17] smitten that great sheep Shepherd when
[1:22:19] he was smitten back there and he said it
[1:22:21] is finished at that minute as soon as
[1:22:24] the shepherd was smitten it was over
[1:22:26] with
[1:22:27] sin was settled there was no more sin
[1:22:30] they were clean the penalty was paid the
[1:22:32] Believers whose names were written on
[1:22:34] the Book of Life predestinated from the
[1:22:37] foundation of the world it was finished
[1:22:39] the very minute Jesus said it was
[1:22:41] finished
[1:22:42] so listen you are dealing with a
[1:22:45] finished enemy
[1:22:48] your healing is already done your
[1:22:51] deliverance is already done how can you
[1:22:54] say that because he said it's finished
[1:22:57] it's over with the great Shepherd that
[1:22:59] came down for a sheep and it was
[1:23:01] finished God's right hand was pulled out
[1:23:03] of his bosom smitten then on Easter he
[1:23:06] returned and he raised up again to his
[1:23:08] bosom and extended down to you and I in
[1:23:10] the form of his word to redeem us back
[1:23:12] to the original Garden from which sin
[1:23:14] took us from he said no wonder the
[1:23:17] mountains jumped and shouted on that day
[1:23:19] no wonder the sun hid his face and
[1:23:22] screamed for Joy no wonder all nature
[1:23:24] broke loose and wind Shook and shooked
[1:23:27] and Shook and joyed and junk they seen
[1:23:29] the prophet Shepherd on the mountain
[1:23:30] redeem every name that was in The Book
[1:23:34] of Life
[1:23:36] Hallelujah and not only that they seen
[1:23:39] that their own nature was also redeemed
[1:23:43] oh God if it can make a earth shout he
[1:23:46] can make the sun shout if he can make
[1:23:48] trees shout and jump for joy what it
[1:23:50] ought to do for the living creatures of
[1:23:52] almighty God that were placed upon this
[1:23:54] Earth to be born in the image of God it
[1:23:56] ought to make something on the inside of
[1:23:58] us when we look back and we see our
[1:24:00] enemies dead and we catch a glimpse of
[1:24:03] our name written in the book
[1:24:06] Hallelujah why are you going to make it
[1:24:09] because my name's written why are you
[1:24:11] going to be there because my name's
[1:24:13] written why are you still overcoming
[1:24:15] because my name's been written down
[1:24:18] and they ain't enough devil eraser to
[1:24:21] take it off
[1:24:26] he said I've seen Joy jumping spells and
[1:24:29] joy spells but there was nobody heard
[1:24:31] the mountains rung out the sun went down
[1:24:34] everything but nobody was hurt I've seen
[1:24:36] meetings where the power of God was
[1:24:38] revealed to the people that they were
[1:24:40] free from the world and the things of
[1:24:42] the world
[1:24:43] hello free from the world and things of
[1:24:47] the world and the joy of the Lord filled
[1:24:50] the congregation they stood and screamed
[1:24:52] and cried and shouted at the top of
[1:24:54] their voice for the glory of God I never
[1:24:56] did see anything disorderly there was
[1:24:58] always right in order because they had
[1:25:01] recognized their name was written in the
[1:25:03] last book of life and that Prophet
[1:25:06] Shepherd Prophet had brought them the
[1:25:08] message and they were delivered
[1:25:13] no matter what the other eggless at
[1:25:16] cholesterol rounds said about it
[1:25:17] Ecclesiastes around Etc they knew what
[1:25:19] had happened
[1:25:24] that's why it doesn't matter what
[1:25:27] anybody says
[1:25:29] about my joy
[1:25:33] because I know what happened
[1:25:37] exactly right brother Joe it ain't their
[1:25:40] Joy
[1:25:42] is mine
[1:25:44] it ain't their peace it's mine
[1:25:47] it ain't their love it's mine it ain't
[1:25:50] their compassion it's am I it ain't
[1:25:52] their Holy Ghost it's mine
[1:25:55] but if they'll ever get a hold of some
[1:25:57] of it it'll do the same thing
[1:26:00] it'll move in them it'll cause the joy
[1:26:03] bells of Heaven to ring out in their
[1:26:04] soul and things begin to pop and Shake
[1:26:08] things begin to move amen Lil's begin to
[1:26:11] come up and give praise to almighty God
[1:26:13] Amen why because they now see there
[1:26:17] wasn't some old trodden down nobody the
[1:26:19] devil been trying to tell them all their
[1:26:21] life the devil been trying to tell them
[1:26:23] it wasn't for them and they couldn't
[1:26:24] make it and they wasn't going to make it
[1:26:25] and if they tried they might as well
[1:26:27] quit because when they're going to
[1:26:28] they're going to quit just sooner or
[1:26:29] later you're going to quit sooner or
[1:26:31] later you're going to give up sooner or
[1:26:33] later you're going to stop sooner or
[1:26:34] later this that and the other shut up
[1:26:36] devil
[1:26:38] Hallelujah you've called me all kinds of
[1:26:41] names you call me every kind of thing in
[1:26:44] the book and one day that might have
[1:26:45] been who I was but today that's not who
[1:26:49] I am I have seen what God called me
[1:26:52] wrote in the Lamb's Book of Life he
[1:26:55] called me Victorious he called me an
[1:26:57] overcomer he called me delivered he
[1:27:00] called me healed he said it was done
[1:27:03] [Applause]
[1:27:10] laughs
[1:27:21] let me
[1:27:23] read this one
[1:27:26] he goes on down he starts talking about
[1:27:30] those are on the right road to Emmaus
[1:27:34] said they had just witnessed one of the
[1:27:36] greatest things that had ever happened
[1:27:38] the greatest thing that ever happened in
[1:27:41] history of mankind
[1:27:44] they witnessed a man
[1:27:47] go up to the Old Rugged Cross and be
[1:27:49] nailed
[1:27:50] and die
[1:27:52] and say it's finished
[1:27:54] laid in the Tomb
[1:27:57] they'd heard the words that he had spoke
[1:27:59] destroy this temple in three days I'll
[1:28:01] raise it up
[1:28:02] I have power to lay my life down and I
[1:28:04] have power to raise it up again but all
[1:28:06] of that left them
[1:28:09] here they found themselves in a place of
[1:28:11] Darkness
[1:28:13] in a place of confusion in place of
[1:28:15] something had taken place and they
[1:28:17] couldn't understand it and they they
[1:28:18] didn't know he didn't know
[1:28:21] you know what
[1:28:23] what
[1:28:24] how's this going to all work out now we
[1:28:26] we thought he was going to be this and
[1:28:28] we thought it was going to be that and
[1:28:29] we thought for sure this was going to
[1:28:30] happen and it didn't happen and their
[1:28:32] minds all on all kinds of things of
[1:28:34] things that didn't work out according to
[1:28:36] them
[1:28:38] and according to them it was all
[1:28:40] Darkness it was all bitterness it was
[1:28:44] all hurt it was all this or that and the
[1:28:46] other
[1:28:47] but all of a sudden as they're talking
[1:28:49] about him here's steps one out of the
[1:28:51] bushes
[1:28:51] and he just kind of joins himself to
[1:28:53] their company
[1:28:55] and he begins to talk when he said why
[1:28:56] are you so sad
[1:28:59] why are you so so sad what is going on
[1:29:02] that you're you're so down on the dumps
[1:29:05] about
[1:29:05] well are you not from here have you have
[1:29:08] you not heard how how how this happened
[1:29:10] they go explaining all of this and he
[1:29:13] starts going back to all the way back in
[1:29:14] history
[1:29:15] but not does he begin to explain all the
[1:29:18] things that went on the prophets that
[1:29:19] spoke about it and he brought him all
[1:29:21] the way down to where present time see
[1:29:23] God's not interested in leaving you in
[1:29:25] history he wants to bring light to now
[1:29:29] and so he brings it to this point and
[1:29:31] the Bible says he started to go on as it
[1:29:34] made us he would go on and they they
[1:29:36] grabbed the hold of him they pulled and
[1:29:37] said no come inside and he'd come inside
[1:29:39] and and he began to speak to him and and
[1:29:41] the Bible said he began to break bread
[1:29:43] as he as he did
[1:29:45] we know what that had to be I mean there
[1:29:47] was only one that could break a piece of
[1:29:49] bread another piece of beer
[1:29:51] amen he broke the bread and the Miracle
[1:29:53] took place and there and the Bible says
[1:29:55] they've got to hear their eyes were open
[1:29:58] all of a sudden the word became a light
[1:30:00] to their path
[1:30:01] and brother Branham said they got real
[1:30:03] light-footed because they realized they
[1:30:06] wasn't dealing now with a god of history
[1:30:08] or a god of yesterday or a God that was
[1:30:11] in the grave they now had a God that
[1:30:13] arose from the grave and then they
[1:30:16] realized that if he rose from the grave
[1:30:18] he was the god of the Resurrection so if
[1:30:21] he was the god of the resurrection and
[1:30:22] they would have and God would be their
[1:30:24] God then that made them part of the
[1:30:26] Resurrection
[1:30:28] and he said if anybody ought to be
[1:30:30] light-footed in this day that we're
[1:30:32] living in he said don't why are you
[1:30:33] worried about it why you he said you
[1:30:35] know what you're going to get to the
[1:30:37] other side and you're going to say these
[1:30:39] when you look back and you see what you
[1:30:40] went through and you're going to he said
[1:30:42] you're going to look back and you're
[1:30:43] going to say why did I fear I missed out
[1:30:46] on so much joy right there
[1:30:50] wow wow amen when we look back and we
[1:30:53] see God
[1:30:57] walking with us and he was talking with
[1:30:58] us and he was explaining himself oh God
[1:31:01] let her eyes come open tonight amen we
[1:31:03] have a risen resurrected Christ among us
[1:31:06] our eyes ought to be down and
[1:31:08] disheartened and on this problem in that
[1:31:10] situation our eyes ought to turn to a
[1:31:13] resurrected Christ and if he's a
[1:31:15] resurrected Christ today and you are
[1:31:17] resurrected people and you know the god
[1:31:20] that brought you out of sin and it
[1:31:22] brought you out of darkness and he
[1:31:24] brought you out of denominational system
[1:31:25] he brought you out of everything the
[1:31:27] devil tried to set a trap for you he
[1:31:29] brought you through and if he brought
[1:31:31] you to now he'll take you all the way
[1:31:35] it ought to make you light-footed and
[1:31:37] put your shoes on your feet to know
[1:31:40] God's with me and God's lead me and
[1:31:42] God's guide me amen I might have lost
[1:31:44] this one or this one might have walked
[1:31:45] away but my God is with me
[1:31:48] [Applause]
[1:31:52] my God is with me
[1:31:57] let me go through a few scriptures we
[1:31:59] bring this down Isaiah 42 and verse 16.
[1:32:02] I back up what Psalms 112 and 4 unto the
[1:32:05] upright there Rises light in the
[1:32:08] darkness because God is gracious and
[1:32:11] full of compassion and righteous Isaiah
[1:32:14] 42 and 16 said I will bring the Blind by
[1:32:18] way they knew not I will lead them in
[1:32:21] past that they have not known I will
[1:32:23] make Darkness light before them and
[1:32:25] crooked things straight these things
[1:32:27] will I do unto them and not forsake them
[1:32:30] Micah 7 and verse 8 Rejoice not against
[1:32:33] Me O My Enemy when I fall I shall rise
[1:32:40] that ought to put some joy in somebody's
[1:32:42] heart you may feel like you're falling
[1:32:44] but oh you need to look at that image
[1:32:46] I'm gonna rise when I sit in darkness
[1:32:50] the Lord shall be enlightened unto me
[1:32:54] Hallelujah Luke 1 and 78 says through
[1:32:57] the tender mercy of our God whereby the
[1:33:00] Dayspring from on high has visited us to
[1:33:03] give us light to them that sit in
[1:33:05] darkness and in the shadow of death to
[1:33:07] guide our feet into the way of peace
[1:33:12] laughs alms 18 and verse 28 for thou
[1:33:16] will light my candor
[1:33:21] if your Candle is lit this evening Who
[1:33:23] lit it
[1:33:26] thou would light my candle the Lord my
[1:33:29] God will Enlighten my darkness
[1:33:33] for by Thee I have warned through a
[1:33:36] troop and by my God I have leaped over a
[1:33:39] wall
[1:33:43] let's get life-footed that enemy had
[1:33:45] surrounded you and built a wall around
[1:33:47] you he'd put a troop all the way around
[1:33:49] you he'd try to keep you hemmed in and
[1:33:52] say this is all you could ever be you'd
[1:33:54] never amount to nothing but God is my
[1:33:57] light
[1:33:58] and he illuminated my path where I could
[1:34:01] run through that truth and I can leap
[1:34:03] over that wall and jump into his arms of
[1:34:06] victory
[1:34:10] as for God his way is perfect the word
[1:34:13] of the Lord is tried he is a buckler to
[1:34:15] all those that trust him for who is God
[1:34:18] save the Lord for who is a rock Save Our
[1:34:20] God it is God that girdeth me his
[1:34:22] strength and maketh my way perfect he
[1:34:25] maketh my feet like Heinz feet
[1:34:29] that means fast
[1:34:32] Fleet of foot
[1:34:36] Hallelujah I don't told you the devil
[1:34:39] don't know who he's missing with messing
[1:34:40] with he gonna get his high run slap over
[1:34:44] he gonna try to put up one last blockade
[1:34:46] from this body taking the change and
[1:34:48] it's going to leave tread marks all over
[1:34:50] him
[1:34:56] oh brother it won't say Good Year it

[1:35:02] of the Living God

[1:35:13] maketh my feed like Heinz feet and
[1:35:15] setteth me up on my high places he
[1:35:18] teaches my hand to war so that the boy
[1:35:20] still is broken by my arm thou has also
[1:35:23] given me the shield of thy salvation and
[1:35:26] thy right hand is holding me up and thy
[1:35:28] gentleness has made me great thou has
[1:35:30] enlarged my steps unto me that my feet
[1:35:33] did not slip
[1:35:36] I have pursued my enemies and overtake
[1:35:38] them
[1:35:39] taking them neither did I turn again to
[1:35:41] they were all consumed I have wounded
[1:35:43] them that they may were not able to rise
[1:35:46] and they are Fallen under my feet
[1:35:50] for thou has girded me with strength
[1:35:52] into the battle that has subdued unto me
[1:35:55] those that rose up against me thou has
[1:35:58] also given me the necks of my enemy that
[1:36:00] I might destroy them that hate me
[1:36:06] who you talking about brother Timothy
[1:36:07] the devil
[1:36:11] not talking about somebody I'm talking
[1:36:13] about the devil
[1:36:17] second Corinthians 4 6 says for God who
[1:36:20] commanded the light to shine out of
[1:36:22] Darkness has shined in our hearts to
[1:36:24] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:36:26] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[1:36:28] but we have this treasure in Earthen
[1:36:31] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[1:36:33] of May It Be of God and not of us we are
[1:36:36] troubled on every side yet not
[1:36:38] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[1:36:41] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[1:36:44] down but not destroyed always bearing
[1:36:47] about in the body the dying of the Lord
[1:36:49] Jesus that the life also of Jesus might
[1:36:52] be made manifest in our body so we have
[1:36:55] the death but we have a life
[1:36:59] the resurrection for we which live are
[1:37:02] always delivered unto the death for
[1:37:03] Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus
[1:37:06] might be made manifest in our mortal
[1:37:07] flesh so then death worketh in us but
[1:37:10] life in you we have the same Spirit of
[1:37:12] Faith according is written I believe
[1:37:14] therefore I've spoken we also believe
[1:37:16] therefore we speak knowing that he which
[1:37:19] raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up
[1:37:21] us also by Jesus and shall present us
[1:37:24] with you for all things of our for your
[1:37:27] sake that the abundance of Grace might
[1:37:29] do the Thanksgiving of many abroad to
[1:37:32] the glory of Lord of God for which cause
[1:37:34] we faint not but through our outward man
[1:37:36] perish at the n-word man is renewed day
[1:37:39] by day for our light Affliction which is
[1:37:42] but for a moment working for us are far
[1:37:44] more exceeding internal weight of Glory
[1:37:46] while we look at the things which are
[1:37:48] seen But at the things which are not
[1:37:51] seen the things which are seen are
[1:37:53] temporary
[1:37:55] but the things which are not seen are
[1:37:58] eternal
[1:38:00] we found out the grave was a temporary
[1:38:03] grave but the resurrection is eternal
[1:38:06] Resurrection
[1:38:08] your formal life was a temporary lie but
[1:38:11] the new life is a is a resurrected life
[1:38:14] it's an eternal life that is burning on
[1:38:17] the inside of you

[1:38:56] waiting on a food got her food I don't
[1:38:57] remember but all of a sudden
[1:39:00] I started hearing a song and I started
[1:39:02] hearing sister Rebecca Adams actually
[1:39:04] sing There Ain't No Grave gonna hold
[1:39:06] this body down
[1:39:08] and I thought what in the world they're
[1:39:10] playing Christian music in here
[1:39:12] and uh because you know it's been
[1:39:14] country music or whatever I hadn't
[1:39:15] really been paying paying attention to
[1:39:17] what was going on
[1:39:19] and I I'm trying to kind of all of a
[1:39:21] sudden you kind of went away from me and
[1:39:22] I looked brother Derek was talking to
[1:39:24] his wife said did y'all did y'all did
[1:39:26] y'all see that light flash
[1:39:28] oh
[1:39:29] did y'all see that light flashing sister
[1:39:31] Rebecca said obviously she acknowledged
[1:39:34] said yes I saw it and so they saw I
[1:39:37] thought it was Mom's phone she's like no
[1:39:39] what y'all saw a lighter with my phone I
[1:39:41] was I I hadn't turned my flashlight on
[1:39:43] but I realized something was taking
[1:39:45] place
[1:39:47] the the spark the resurrecting power is
[1:39:52] Among Us
[1:39:54] amen and I know God had done some
[1:39:57] powerful things that evening and but I
[1:39:59] think God's wanting to do more than just
[1:40:01] all that
[1:40:03] I got to thinking about that there was a
[1:40:06] song my brother Philip sang and his
[1:40:07] family there there ain't no gray there
[1:40:09] the same song kind of but it's a little
[1:40:11] different type so There Ain't No Grave
[1:40:13] gonna hold this body down and it says
[1:40:15] since you walked out of the Grave I'm
[1:40:17] walking too
[1:40:19] if you walked out of the Grave I'm
[1:40:21] walking too and though I'm telling you
[1:40:23] today it started rolling through me as I
[1:40:25] began to study this on being
[1:40:27] light-footed as these men begin to
[1:40:29] realize there's a resurrected Christ
[1:40:30] Among Us it ain't a dead living Creed it
[1:40:33] ain't a dead God it ain't a God of
[1:40:35] History it ain't a God of yesterday or a
[1:40:38] god of tomorrow it's a god of right now
[1:40:42] I don't know you ought to put some
[1:40:44] George shoes on somebody's feet Amen to
[1:40:47] make them light-footed when they shake
[1:40:49] off those heavy baths and they shake off
[1:40:51] that Spirit of nervousness and fear and
[1:40:53] they begin to realize God is a god of
[1:40:56] resurrection and if he walked out of the
[1:40:58] Grave I'm walking too
[1:41:01] hallelujah how many here tonight say God
[1:41:03] you walked out I'm walking out
[1:41:07] because you walked out I can walk out
[1:41:10] because you overcame I'm an overcomer

[1:41:15] arise above him
