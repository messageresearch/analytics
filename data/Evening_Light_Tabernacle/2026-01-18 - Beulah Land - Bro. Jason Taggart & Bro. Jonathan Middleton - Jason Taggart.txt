TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[music] I'm [music] kind of home [singing] sick for [music and singing] the country to [music and singing] which I'm &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; been before. [singing] [bell] No surprise [singing] [music] will there be spoken [music] for time [singing] anymore. [singing] Oh, beautiful [singing and music] land I [singing] want [music] for you. [music] And someday [singing] hold me [singing and music] still. [music] There my hope shall be [music and singing] eternal. [music] to the [singing] land [music] sweeping [singing] the land. I'm looking out across the river [music] to where [singing] my face [music] going [singing] to end inside. [music] There's [singing] just a few more days [singing and music] to labor [music] and [singing] then I'll take my heavenly [music] new [music] I'm [singing] longing [music] for you. And [singing and music] someday only I see [singing] [music] where my heart [singing] shall be eternal. [music] You land [singing] sweet. [music] [singing] Sing with us four more times. You [singing and music] love I'm [music] longing [singing] for you. And [music and singing] someday all thee [music] I'll say [singing] where [singing and music] my heart shall [singing and music] be &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You are [music] sweet. [singing] Oh, [singing and music] you love the lamb. Sweet [music] sweet lamb. [singing]
