he's great do you know he's great he's a great God Amen and he's worthy to be praised amen that's just by our hearts to him and let's ask the Lord to take preeminence in his service and father we just want to say how much we love you how much we appreciate you and thank you for all that you've done in our lives Lord where would we be without you lord directing and moving and touching we asked father that you had come this evening in a very special way I've asked you Lord to come and touch hearts and lives and I know you've heard my prayer and my request and I asked father that you would just touch lives Lord in a Great and Mighty way father and lift our heads Lord towards the things of God and off of our doubts and off of our fears and unbeliefs and worries and and look to the hills which cometh our help because our Help Cometh From The Lord we as father you take Lord these words and anoint them to our hearts we pray we ask these things in Jesus name [Music] let's turn to habakkuk 2 and verse 2 if you would amen it's good to be thank you good to be in the house of the Lord and and like David I was glad when they said it to me it's time Amen to go to his house and and to hear from him and amen I believe that's what happens amen when a man can set aside his time and energies and labor for the Lord and ask what he what what he would say I believe that's amen the order of the church and the Order of God to speak through a man amen and you but the thing of it is men have to realize it's not just a man it's God speaking amen and so then it can be something to you to help you in a spiritual way I want to say what Lord Willam will be leaving this coming week going to brother Sean Martin's tent meeting and then on to brother Ron Spencer so we covet your prayers and amen with a little bit weakened body but we thank the Lord will recovering and getting stronger so we thank the Lord for that um habakkuk 2 and verse 2 says and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an important time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it Tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry in other words though it tarry it's worth waiting for amen it's worth waiting for we'll let you be seated like to speak to you on the light the season of change we talked about last Wednesday about the change of seasons and we know many of us we could ask um we could see very quickly in this building there's many people in all various types of seasons of their lives there's many that would be in a winter season as we talked about our summer season but amen as we know seasons change and and God is the god over the season so no matter what season that you're in God is in that moment and in that time and whether it be suffering he's there whether it be heartache he's there whether it be happiness or Joy or or dancing or shouting he's there amen he's in every season of your life and so we know that the word is spoken amen for an appointed time in this time again is a time appointed or time set aside and and so we're not careful as we said last Wednesday we get in a hurry and we want God to change it before he's ready to change it and therefore we'll try to manipulate things or turn things in our own favor to turn things that God is actually trying to do in our lives but as it said though at Terry it is and it's it seems like it's taken a while wait for it and I like that out on it because it's worth waiting for amen when God brings something to fulfillment in your life it's worth waiting for amen because it's for your good amen because it will surely come and it will not tear because what is it saying when the time comes it will not wait another moment amen it won't tarry another moment it may have been years coming to that moment but when that moment is there there's not nothing that can delay it any longer or make it a little go you know go go out further in your life but when God brings that moment in your life it'll happen amen and and sometimes you'll look back and like wow that was so quick that was so amazing how God did that you know and I look at that same word on weight as in Isaiah 40 and verse 28 it says hast thou not known has thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength amen even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fail but they that wait they that wait amen that weight is to remain in place in readiness amen that's what the word means it means to remain in place and Readiness or expectation of something or wait your turn or wait your orders or oh wait it's also where the word waiter comes from or waitress comes from it's also has an application of a servitude in these moments amen it's not that you're just dry and Barren and you have nothing to offer but in your waiting moments God can still work through your life God can still touch others in your life God can still minister to others in your life through the times that you're going through it's time that you feel are so hard sometimes people are watching and they're seeing how you react they're seeing what you do during those times and in that it is giving them strength to continue on look at brother Ron he's in the season of seemingly waiting I mean for a moment of a healing of a complete deliverance but during that time of waiting how much does God use that man to stand and proclaim the The Virtuous powers of Almighty God Amen there with that sickness in his body but still saying God still heals God still delivers amen during that waiting God is using him for his glory amen but when the time comes for that appointment that healing they ain't a devil in hell that can stop him amen they can't add one more moment to it he can't add one more second to it but the word will be fulfilled in his life so many times as we said last last week Wednesday many times we find ourselves in seasons of waiting we're waiting on the Lord to move it in a hard situation or a certain situation or maybe some financial help we're often we're waiting on God for many things and but in those seasons of waiting God is there he is using those times just as effectively as effectively as he uses the good times or the hard times he is transforming Us by the power of almighty God into the likeness of Jesus Christ therefore the times of waiting are not wasted they're not wasted amen you may feel like amen you're in a time of Sorrow it's not wasted amen God is working something out of your life and in your life you know I look at the the the children of Israel when they were carried off into Babylon and and I want to go into that for a moment in Psalms 137 and verse 1. amen they found themselves amen now in captivity and a season of captivity in a in a season that wasn't very nice to them they had been taken away from their homes and their lands and and all the things that were familiar to them and they were in sorrow and great sorrow and it says here in Psalms 137 and verse 1 it says by the Rivers of Babylon there we sat down yay we wept when we remembered Zion we hung or hanged our Harps upon the Willows in the midst thereof for their they that for their they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us Merc saying sing us one of the songs of Zion how shall we sing the Lord's song in such a Strange Land now they hung their Harps up their song was taken they they seemed that their Destiny or their purpose or their future was in doubt and they were captives both physically and emotionally to them God was far away and he wasn't going to return amen this is where they were in their season as they were taken out in times a time when they didn't feel the worship and the joy they had once felt before they had been brought into this season because of their sin amen you said well what's that have to do with us we have been brought into this falling world because of Adam's sin amen therefore we were born in captivity we were born in sin and shaped in iniquity we we were exiled from the presence of almighty God many times the signs of living in captivity you know is the loss of your dream or the loss of your life or the loss of your joy or the loss of your testimony or the loss of your hope or the loss of your fruitfulness but remember you don't change Seasons you adjust the seasons when it's winter and cold what do you do you go put on a coat when it's summer you take or Springtime comes you take it off and then there's days in the spring you don't know what to wear but you just adjust to what's going on but the good news amen if you're in a winter spring is about to happen and it can happen very suddenly in your life amen it can happen in just a moment the season can change and you look back and you say how did I even make it through winter time and here you are now standing in Spring but God was watching over your life and ordaining you during that season to walk a certain time but when the time come to change it change and the moment changed in your life suddenly amen you can be full of sorrow and suddenly you become become full of joy suddenly change can fall off and freedom be released suddenly you can be Barren and suddenly you can be full of life amen yea this is what the change of season I want to go through some of these changes of this word and and 2 and verse 1 and again I'm gonna go through a bunch of scriptures so yeah you just just follow along as you can with the day of Pentecost was fully come they were with all all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all that in the house they were sitting and they appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it's set upon each one of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak in other tongues and spirit gave them mutters and and and so listen at one time we had deniers we had people that had walked away we had all kinds of things but they began to move in another a moment another time and and focus their attention not towards their faults and towards their failures but towards their God and how he told them to tarry in Jerusalem and they were both over their focus began to move into that realm and suddenly they were no longer deniers they were Sons and Daughters of God they were no longer Sinners and away from God they had been changed their season of Life had changed very suddenly amen Paul as he was known as Saul was on his way to persecute the Church of the Living God he throwed many in jail he'd gave many stripes but the Bible says in Acts chapter 9 and verse 3 it says as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly they're shined around him about a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying Saul Saul why persecuted me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecuted is it hard for you to kick against the Pricks and he trembling astonished said Lord what will you have me do and the Lord said arise and go into the City and it shall be told what thou must do so oh one at one moment he's on his high horse suddenly is down in the ground looking up at a light and everything changed in his life amen it can happen suddenly can I drop this in about your children they may be on their high horse right now they may be on their road down the wrong path and doing the wrong things amen but suddenly things can change [Applause] seasons can change very quickly and I I believe we're in a season of change I believe we're in the season of a of a change of dispensation and you know I I just got I don't have this in my notes but I've been thinking about it brother Brown talks about the Junctions of time and he said at every Junction omnipotence is spoke and when omnipotence speaks the miraculous takes place I believe we're at the season of change amen we say well what's the season of change the change of these mortal bodies and omnipotence is going to speak and when it speaks miraculous will take place and suddenly one day your children's loss and the next day they're saved amen this is the god who does things suddenly seasons can change in just a moment acts verse of Acts chapter 16 and 25 we find that midnight Paul and Silas pray one of my favorite scriptures in all of the Bible just uh events I guess and saying Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake Amen in one moment they're bound and one moment they're beaten and one moment they're bruised and they say you know in these moments we can still praise God in these moments we can still lift our hands and to give Thanksgiving Amen in these moments we can still worship Him hallelujah amen what happened all of a sudden everything changed you don't realize just how quickly something can change in your life right now you may be feeling bound and defeated but if you'll just start lifting up your hands and say God in these moments I'm still going to praise you and these moments I'm still going to worship you you don't know God will send an earthquake he'll send the Whirlwind he'll say whatever it takes and immediately your season can change immediately that's the same word suddenly immediately Matthew 8 and verse 2 said behold there came a leper and worship him saying Lord if thou will thou can't make me clean and Jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying I will be thou clean and what immediately his leprosy was cleansed hallelujah amen immediately his leprosy was cleansed listen that leprosy is a type of sin it don't take years and years and years to get rid of sin it can be done immediately cigarettes can fall off and habits can fall off it every kind of ungodly Spirit can fall off it can happen immediately you say well God make me whole he will God save me he will God heal me he will God delivered me out of my situation he will [Applause] amen Mark chapter 1 and verse 29 says in for with when they would come out of the synagogue they entered the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John but Simon's wife motherly sick of a fever Anon they fell they fed they failed to tell they tell them of her and he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up and immediately the fever left and she ministered unto them Mark chapter 2 and verse 10 says and ye may know that the son of man hath power on the earth to forgive sins he said that to the sick of the palsy I say unto thee arise and take up thy bad and go thy way into thy house and immediately he rose and he took up his bed say what you want to about the chosen but when they portrayed that down there at that pool of Bethesda and Peter come up to that man and said you know he told you to take up your bed because you're not coming back oh my God Amen too many times God will lift us up and we'll leave our bed there as a crutch to go back to listen God can deliver you of spirits but if you allow what's this leftovers to linger you'll go right back to them listen people can be delivered in a prayer line and walk out delivered and the next day filled with Spirits again demons have ever had all kind of Hell taking over their bodies why they didn't get rid of the bed what they've laid on for years and they've lagged around on and they've been a crutch to them he did this to me and he done that to me it's nothing but a bear Jesus said you're healed get rid of the bed allow forgiveness to flow through your life or you'll go back and he went he immediately arose and took up the bed and went for it before them all ain't so much they were all amazed and glorified God saying we never saw it on this fashion well you let me tell you they never saw it on the fashion that's about to happen all of a sudden gray hair is going to go back wrinkles are going to disappear old age is going to disappear spirits of of hell are going to be bound they ain't never gonna they've never saw it on the fashion that's about to take place amen you're talking about amazement Mark chapter 10 and verse 46 and said they come to Jericho and as he went out of Jericho with the disciples and a great number of people blind Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus said by the highway side begging and when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out and say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and many charged him to hold his peace you know who was charging him to hold his peace those who had eyes come on now they wasn't the blind man they hadn't been in that season they hadn't been in that moment and they're saying hold your peace you're talking to me I've been born blind and I have this blindness and I have an opportunity that I can receive healing and you want me to remain quiet This Is My Season of change reminds me of the young boy that brother Brandon prayed for in the wheelchair I believe it was and he was going around testifying of of the of the power of God still in a wheelchair but testifying and then you know it's supposedly putting a stain on the gospel as they said and he said you're making a mockery of it and he said why would you take from me the only hope that I got why would you take from me the only hope that I've got and he said in the name of Jesus Christ I'm Healed and at that moment he stepped up out of that wheelchair and walked out of there come on now when you recognize it's not just a man coming through the building it's Jesus and I need a season of change I need a marked moment in my life that I know God Made Me why would you hold me back Jesus that cry brother Brown said stopped heaven that cry stopped heaven and Jesus Stood Still others were mocking him others were saying all kinds of things about him others were trying to quieten it down others are trying to do whatever they wanted to do but this blind man stopped Jesus by cry and commanded him to be called in the blood they called the blind man saying unto them be of good Comfort rise and he called a thee and he casting away His Garment he knew he wasn't going to need that Beggar's garment no more his season was about to change he rose and he came to Jesus amen and Jesus said what will thou should do to thee and the blind said Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said go thy way thy faith has made thee whole and immediately he received a sight hallelujah amen Luke chapter 8 and verse 43 says a woman having an issue of blood 12 years which has spent all over living upon position neither could be healed of any but came behind him and touched the border of His Garment and admittedly her issue of blood stopped others were trying to keep her away they knew what it would be for a bloody woman to touch a priest or to touch him and you would be unclean she had a need I don't care how vital Center you are Jesus is willing to take on your uncleanness it doesn't matter he's able this Blood is powerful enough amen Hallelujah Acts chapter 3 and verse 6 Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I to thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and he lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones receive strength and he leaped up stood and walked and entered with him to the temple walking and leaping and praising God and all the people saw him walking and praising God and they knew that it was he that sat by the arms of beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement of that which had happened unto him but God rich in Mercy but going back to Israel they didn't stay in captivity forever God had a promise over their life and there was a time the season was going to change God was going to remember his people or did another couple Wednesdays tonight my brother Carmen God remembers it's not that he's forgotten it's just a time for something to be fulfilled so God remembers and then I want to read about them coming back in Psalms 126 he said when the Lord turned again the Captivity of Zion we were like them that dream you ever been there you have something so good to you has happened it's almost like you're dreaming that's how you're painting yourself and like is this really real and you're trying to look around he said we were like them that dream then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue was singing then said they among the Heathen the Lord hath done great things for them the Lord had done so much for them that the Heathen had to testify God's at work this is the Lord's doing Hallelujah this is the Lord's doing only God can do this Hallelujah and the Lord hath done great things for us whereof we are glad he has turned our captivity oh Lord as the streams in the South and they that sow in tears listen to the season change shall reap enjoy [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah you may have been balling buckets of Tears this way but don't worry you're just seeing the suffering but get ready for the glory the glory of God is about to be released and your tears will be turned to Joy Hallelujah and he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing in the sheafs Hallelujah you don't know the power of the sea that's on the inside of you is not to just have one little tiny plant one little tiny piece of fruit one little tiny thing in your life no sir it's a is that things that seed lays Every Blessing of almighty God in that moment of your life in that little place of your life lays everything God has for you there's power in the sea and you might be weeping because carry that one seed and saying God how can I take it one more time how can I go one more moment how can I go one more hard to sudden the season change man I can't hardly carry all these blessings [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah I can't hardly contain the joy that he's given me season can change very rapidly but just don't miss the change yeah I know what I'm talking about it says here's Psalm Psalm verse Chapter 30 and verse one it said a Psalm and a song at the dedication of the House of David I will extol that stole the O Lord for thou Has Lifted Me Up and has not made my foes Rejoice over me oh Lord my God I Cried unto thee and thou Hast healed me oh Lord thou has brought me I'm out my soul from the grave thou has kept me alive that I should not go down into the pit singing to the Lord O ye Saints of his and give thanks at the remembrance of his Holiness for his anger endureth for a moment in his favor though is life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning Hallelujah and in my Prosperity I said I shall never be moved Lord by their favor thou has made my Mountain stand strong thou has hit thy face and I was troubled I cried to thee O Lord and unto the Lord I made supplication what prophet is there in my blood that I go down to the pit shall the dust praise thee shall declare thy truth here O Lord have mercy on me Lord be thou my helper then thou has turned for me my morning into dancing and my sackcloth and girded me with gladness to the end that my glory may sing praise unto thee and not be silent O Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee forever one day Exiles the next day home one day Sinners the next day saves Sons and Daughters of God we are not in Exile no longer [Applause] Hallelujah we have a right to take our hearts down and play and to sing the Praises of almighty God let me read you a little footnote about this uh give me a second a footnote about the harps it says here we hanged our Harps upon the Willows this man said these words are not without great probability but and and are the words of some holy Levites who were been accustomed to music both vocal and instrumental in the temple of God he said Harps are put here speaking of all instruments of music he said it is further to be observed that Harps were used by the Greeks in mourning but they were used by the Hebrews in rejoicing Hallelujah I don't want to be a Greek apologize I don't want to be one I want I am a blood-bought Son of God Amen I am a son of Abraham spiritual seed spiritual Israel amen that's who I am therefore I will not use amen my but my gift or what God has given or the the instruments for mourning no sir they are to rejoice and see the Praises of almighty God [Applause] this is the season that we're in it's to worship him and to give him praise Hallelujah it is a season for impossibilities to become possible we have been brought back to the land of Our Father Abraham it is a land of faith it is the land of the promised son it is the land amen where God has ordained us to

warned him said don't do that he said because you're putting you're putting what it was that he was making it where the people would only have faith if they saw a miracle that's not what God wants God wants you to have faith before miracle and so after he would come to the moment and it goes down to the point he asked God he said Lord if I've been wrong show it to me let me tell you God showed him very plainly because they had a miracle line the girl there was deaf and barely could hear before it was over she couldn't hear lick got worse and worse second person he had to shut it down and he began he had to repent before God and make it right he come he actually came back and he said look I've been wrong I'm thankful for a prophet like that I've been wrong I've done something God told me not to do he's then he began to explain he said listen God Wants You amen not to have faith because you saw something God wants you to have faith even before you see anything happen see he said I'm the one that prays he said but you're the one that has faith come on now listen it ain't all about all that's going on up here or out there you have to have the faith I believe right now a season can change so quickly in this service and it'd be over with but all it says Lord be somebody to say God I need that moment with you I need that to come on my mind my bench my Pew my heart so when we come there to that great wedding supper the season of change and we look across the table at one another oh God just a slip a little handshake over with tears of joy running down our cheeks but the king will come out in his Beauty and he'll wipe every tear from our eyes and he'll say don't cry it's all over now there'll be no more healing campaigns no more tired restless nights no more wheelchairs Graves or sickness oh that great day when you'll say father enter into the joys of the Lord I long to hear you say that we are in that season when the Great supper set and we sit across the table the wedding supper I look across the table I say I recognize him he's from Finland I recognize him he's in that area meeting I reach across the table and I take you by the hand and we shed a few tears won't you won't we he said the first thing you know the king will walk out and all his Beauty he'll take his hands and he'll wipe all the tears from our eyes he'll put his arm around you and say don't cry now it's all over he said there won't be no more healing Services no more hot nights No More Tears no more wheelchairs no more crutches it'll all be over enter you into the joys of the Lord I want to be there don't you said thinking that sometime when life is all over the last prayer is set on here on Earth and the Bible's closed and we come down to the end of the road and we enter into his Joys up there I just wonder when that great supper said that last supper setting down lines thousands of miles crosses will sit across the table because I'm telling you now it's going to be a glorious time we'll look across the table to one another and see those veterans who fought to win the prize sail through bloody Seas I guess we'll shake each other's hand no doubt a little tear will drop down our cheeks King will come out and he'll wipe the tears from our eyes and say don't cry it's over now we're in the season of change many times you know we get under pressure we get under things in our lives we have worries we have doubts we're still human Daniel was put in a pressurized moment in Daniel 2 and verse 19. and his life was actually laying on the line and it says then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision in other words when it was night God still gave him sight in The Darkest Hours God still got Daniels that can look through the darkness and God give them Vision in the night he said then Daniel blessed the god of heaven and Daniel answered and said blessed be the name of our God forever and ever for wisdom and might are his he changes the times and the seasons he removed with Kings and he Sabbath up Kings hello somebody he allows things to rise and he'll tear them down he'll allow walls to be built around his children but when it was a time for their freedom they were tore down he rises raises Kings and he set it down Kings he'd give us wisdom to the wise and knowledge to them that no understanding he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the Darkness a dark moment he knows what's in there Hallelujah he's already got the answer for you and the light dwelleth with him I think the impraisal Lord oh god of my fathers who have given me wisdom in my and hath made known unto me now what we desire of thee for thou has no now made known unto us the king's not we are then we're walking in darkness but God's given us a vision to see and he's made known to us not some Earthly King not some King that is has our evil dominion over our no no he's given us amen the king's matter he's allowed us to see what it's all about where we are the times and the seasons what's about to happen and we can say hey A change is about to take place he's made known to us the king's matter the king knows what season you're in I I want you to understand these notes and things have been on this iPad since about Friday Saturday and Sunday was a culmination of some real emotions in my life and we'll be real real for a moment about four years ago I was looking to go into business and seemed like the Lord was setting up some things very it just looked like the Lord and so I had made these plans the plans were in place and things were moving and I went up to brother Rollins to minister and went and ate dinner with him at his house next morning at the service or the next morning actually when they had Sunday night Saturday night Sunday night at that time but we went up on the mountain on a Sunday morning and he said y'all heard y'all heard the testimony at camp about without and I think there's a name held it oh no the brothers got the greenhouse Aiden really Aiden and that was powerful how big was it when I prayed 10 by 20. how big is it now five acres Greenhouse and so he pulled me aside on the side of that mountain was looking over that beautiful Shenandoah Valley and he said this is the time he said brother Timothy I'm just going to tell you he said I went to lay down after you left yesterday and said I couldn't sleep went in my office and I um just got quiet before the Lord and he began to speak to me about you and I hadn't spoken a word to brother Ron about what I was my plans and he says God said to you're not to go into business he said but God said tell him he's my servant I'll take care of him he said now I've talked to brother Aiden I've talked to another brother up in BC and God has exploded their business he said even you know me and my sons we have a thing that we do he said but that's not for you that's not what the Lord this is I'm just telling you what the Lord told I took it it's from the Lord and I saw very quickly my situation changed and and God provided all these four years he's provided over and abundantly but just in these last couple of months things begin to change and I saw the change that was taking place and and I saw that very quickly things were changing financially and unexpected things were happening and I'm wondering what do I do and so you're trying to in your moments of worry and fear you try to figure this out and you're digging yourself deeper and you're digging yourself deeper and then the devil's on you're like well see you could go do this and you could go do that and I you know you left this job that was paid now paying this much see what you know the Lord's really taken care of you and all this stuff you know mind battles and then you know Sister Ruth going through what she's going through and and the devil's laughing at me about that and all that so Saturday evening my emotions are so raw and they come to the front and then Sunday after I led to sing and I went to the back and I just got on that couch back there and I just cried out to God I said God I I need some I need you to move I said because I don't want to get bitter I I want to stay right in this season I I know it's a test and I I don't want to fail this test but Lord I'm at my end I don't know what to do I don't know where to turn and so fast forward to Monday morning me and brother Tim decided to go get some groceries I jumped in the car with him I went and got a few for our house and we come back we saw sister Ruth and and Katie and his sister Emily walking up the highway and so we went on into the house and took the groceries in and I was sitting there on the couch and just had got a text or something or just finished talking and by the time my wife walks in she said hey here's a card for you I said car and I looked at it and uh I said well I wonder what this is about and you know I'm gonna be honest with you I'm a guy don't go to the mailbox because they're bills there's you know something going on I I I don't I don't go to the mailbox sister Ruth she gets aggravated with me sometime when we drive by and I was like ain't stopping so I get this card it says with appreciation some lives are true reflections of God's love sending a prayer of thanks to God and a note of thanks to you brother Timothy God knew what he was doing when he put you in our lives thank you for all the encouragement and friendship it's been a huge blessing to us God bless please accept this gift to do with you as you do as you please I flipped that thing over and all I could say was oh my God and I crushed down and I begin to cry and say God I've tried to hold but try to have faith but Lord forgive me for my own belief right there laying down on Monday morning was everything I had need of to take care of all that I had and let me tell you a little secret we had been gone from the house we'd been out with the kids to the lake property there on Friday and Saturday we came home real quick I bypassed the mailbox and I went straight jumped in some clothes to come here for brother Aaron's dad's memorial brother Ross and so we did we're very hardly and sister Ruth got that from on Monday but the mail hadn't run yet all the time that I was in agony all the time that I was weeping and asking God to move he had already moved all he was saying his son go to the mailbox I've already provided it for you I've already given it to you I've already gave you what you have need of all you got to do is go to the mailbox can I say that tonight
