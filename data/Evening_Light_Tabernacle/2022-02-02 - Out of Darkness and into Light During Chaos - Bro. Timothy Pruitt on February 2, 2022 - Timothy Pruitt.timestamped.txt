[6:25] how many know that in the old testament
[6:27] the priests would take the blood and
[6:29] they'd take a little goat
[6:33] a little goat knew no wrong
[6:35] that little goat was perfect
[6:38] and they take the blood your sin
[6:41] if you're in the congregation your sin
[6:44] my sin and place it on that little goat
[6:47] and that little goat would get turned
[6:49] out loose in the wilderness that was
[6:52] christ on the cross
[6:54] and that little goat would wander out in
[6:55] the wilderness helpless
[6:57] he was a bleeding lamb
[6:59] and the wild beast would tear him peace
[7:02] to peace and you didn't know it
[7:05] you were in the congregation it was gone
[7:07] your sins were gone
[7:09] amen and that's what he did when he took
[7:11] our sins and he took him down to hell
[7:14] and he put him right back on the devil
[7:16] right back where they belong because we
[7:18] don't own them they're gone
[7:20] the things you might have done earlier
[7:23] say father forgive me
[7:25] they're gone just like that and that's
[7:27] how we come into service tonight the
[7:29] redeemed of the lord to sing his praises
[7:32] shout hallelujah because he took
[7:35] all of our sin listening that one more
[7:37] time
[7:38] one day he's coming back for me
[7:40] and one day
[7:43] [Music]

[19:43] amen
[19:47] i said it's good to be in the house
[19:48] [Music]
[19:50] amen well we had a wonderful trip this
[19:52] weekend jessica and i went to arizona to
[19:55] be there with the believers at tucson
[19:57] tabernacle they're six years without a
[19:59] pastor and no
[20:01] i'm not applying
[20:02] uh
[20:03] but we were there and we were a blessing
[20:06] and the people seemed to really enjoy
[20:07] the ministry but more importantly we
[20:09] were there for sister rachel give her
[20:10] support during this time she's
[20:13] been out there almost two and a half
[20:14] months now
[20:15] and just is wearing on her she misses
[20:17] each and every one of you she told us to
[20:19] greet you all and she i think she does
[20:21] plan on coming back for our anniversary
[20:23] meetings that we're having so it'll be
[20:24] good to have her back here with us as a
[20:26] church family
[20:28] you know when one person is uh not here
[20:30] we all miss it we all are integral part
[20:32] of this church and the body and how we
[20:34] function so we just want to continue to
[20:36] lift her up in prayer sister helen in
[20:38] prayer she's doing really good
[20:40] i've been knowing sister helen for close
[20:41] to 23 years and honestly this is the
[20:44] only second time i've ever seen her
[20:45] smile
[20:46] so we walked in the room and she just
[20:48] lit up probably more so for jessica but
[20:50] it was great she had a great time she's
[20:52] doing well recovering well so we're
[20:54] thankful for that but we do have some
[20:56] needs we want to mention tonight we have
[20:58] the hollis family they're of course up
[21:00] in age and would love to be here to
[21:02] occupy a pew a place on the seat here

[21:27] struggle last week and brother tim's
[21:29] been in back and forth with brother

[34:25] genesis 1 and verse 1 and all also
[34:27] isaiah 60
[34:29] and verse 1
[34:32] amen
[34:34] it says in the beginning god created the
[34:36] heavens and the earth
[34:38] and the earth was without form
[34:41] and void and darkness was upon the face
[34:43] of the deep
[34:44] and the spirit of god moved
[34:46] upon the face of the waters
[34:49] and god said let there be light and
[34:51] there was light
[34:52] and god saw the light that it was good
[34:55] and god divided the light from the
[34:58] darkness
[34:59] and god called the light day and the
[35:02] darkness he called night
[35:04] and the evening and the morning were
[35:06] the first day
[35:08] also isaiah 60 and verse 1 says arise
[35:11] shine for thy light has come
[35:14] and the glory of the lord has risen upon
[35:16] thee
[35:17] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[35:19] earth in gross darkness the people but
[35:22] the lord shall arise upon thee and his
[35:25] glory shall be seen
[35:27] upon thee
[35:28] amen how many can say praise the lord
[35:32] amen
[35:33] a place of darkness but in the middle of
[35:35] the darkness a great light
[35:37] amen we'll let you be seated
[35:41] like to speak to you this evening out of
[35:44] darkness
[35:45] and into light
[35:47] during chaos
[35:51] as we read read here as the bible says
[35:53] that the world
[35:55] was without form
[35:56] and was void
[35:58] there was nothing but just the darkness
[36:00] of chaos
[36:02] and it was a horrible shape that it must
[36:04] have been nothing
[36:06] but way into the darkness younger
[36:08] without a light or anything in the
[36:09] churning of the waters
[36:11] and the wandering star twisting as it
[36:14] were twisted around and around
[36:17] nothing to hold it nothing to keep it in
[36:19] orbit nothing to place it in a certain
[36:22] place or just just as it was just seemed
[36:25] like a a terrific mass that was lost
[36:29] couldn't find its way
[36:31] and this was where the earth was at as
[36:33] we now stand upon it today it's a
[36:35] beautiful place there's beautiful
[36:38] days upon this earth there's
[36:40] uh you know the sun that shines upon
[36:43] this earth there's the atmosphere that
[36:45] we enjoy that
[36:46] of good weather and things that that are
[36:48] here is here now but at one time it was
[36:51] nothing but a a just a mass of uh chaos
[36:55] as the winds would swirl around it and
[36:58] and waters would churn and things that
[37:00] were taking place
[37:01] as it was going to its place where god
[37:04] would prepare for it
[37:06] and you know this is what brother
[37:07] branham would say they said there's a
[37:09] type of how we were when we were also
[37:12] wandering stars and away from god
[37:15] without hope without god just turning
[37:18] around out of the darkness not knowing
[37:21] where we're going
[37:22] amen i believe every one of us could say
[37:24] that's who we were at one time
[37:26] amen out in that darkness and and of sin
[37:29] or darkness of
[37:31] whatever system you may have found
[37:32] yourself in and it was a great chaos of
[37:35] things that was around you your life
[37:37] didn't make sense you didn't know which
[37:39] way many times was up or which way was
[37:41] down and
[37:42] you know that's how it is when you're
[37:44] you get in the time of darkness i i
[37:46] don't i know many of us has has been in
[37:48] a room when when the lights would go out
[37:50] and you very quickly lose your bearings
[37:52] you very quickly uh lose you know where
[37:55] you're at and you don't know exactly
[37:57] where the furniture is exactly and bump
[37:59] your toes or or whatever amen because
[38:02] you know it sends you into a bit of
[38:04] chaos and this is what darkness does but
[38:07] his word was spoke over the darkness and
[38:10] over the chaos it was spoke over all the
[38:13] winds it was spoke all over all the
[38:16] turmoil when it said let there be light
[38:19] and that mass of creation power went out
[38:22] and began to create a sun begin to
[38:24] create a moon and begin to pull out of
[38:27] the earth the things that were laying in
[38:29] there in the earth until it would take
[38:31] it from a place of chaos into a garden
[38:34] of eden amen by the word of god and and
[38:37] god was showing right there that his
[38:39] word is powerful enough over any kind of
[38:42] darkness any kind of problem any
[38:45] situation you know maybe it might have
[38:47] been when he said let there be light
[38:49] there might have been hundreds of years
[38:50] it might have been thousands of years we
[38:52] don't know exactly the time that it took
[38:54] place but his word spoken let there be
[38:57] light before there ever was a light but
[39:00] it had to come to pass
[39:02] because god said so
[39:04] just as it just as though he has said
[39:07] god i'm going to have a church it
[39:08] doesn't matter how many dark ages
[39:10] they've been through doesn't matter how
[39:12] many problems and situations
[39:14] he spoke it he said i'm going to have a
[39:16] church without spot without wrinkle amen
[39:19] it doesn't matter how bad the degree of
[39:22] chaos is or how bad the darkness is or
[39:25] how bad the things are around us his
[39:27] word is already spoke so darkness can't
[39:30] do anything about it it can try it can
[39:32] gather itself he can try but darkness
[39:35] will never defeat light
[39:37] amen light can always defeat darkness it
[39:40] can always push it back but darkness
[39:42] will never defeat light amen you could
[39:44] turn every light in this building off
[39:46] amen you could strike a match it's a
[39:48] little bitty thing amen and it would
[39:50] push back the darkness amen but that
[39:52] darkness could never push back the light
[39:55] amen because we see a showing there in
[39:58] type that his word will always defeat
[40:01] amen the darkness it will defeat
[40:03] overcome every wind of doctrine his word
[40:06] will prevail it doesn't matter how
[40:08] impossible it seems he will prevail
[40:12] he would show us this amen as an
[40:14] attribute of himself in revelations 5 as
[40:17] one of the elders would say to john weep
[40:19] not behold the lion of the tribe of
[40:21] judah the root of david hath prevailed
[40:24] over darkness he prevails over sin he
[40:28] prevails over demonic oppression he
[40:31] prevails over every sickness he hath
[40:34] prevailed amen he prevails amen over
[40:38] everything that the enemy would ever
[40:40] come with amen we could find him in john
[40:42] 1 and verse 4 it says in him was life
[40:45] and the life was the light of men and
[40:48] the light shineth in darkness and the
[40:50] darkness comprehendeth it not or the
[40:53] light or in other words it the light
[40:55] shines and the darkness can do nothing
[40:58] about it
[41:00] hallelujah amen when his light shines
[41:03] amen darkness can do nothing about it
[41:05] because it cannot put out the word of
[41:08] god it cannot stop the word of god it
[41:10] cannot keep it from coming to pass amen
[41:12] demons may try demons may scream they
[41:15] may holler they may protest but they
[41:18] cannot stop the word of god from being
[41:20] fulfilled amen but we see you know as we
[41:23] look at this light in darkness in every
[41:26] exodus there was darkness amen there was
[41:29] chaos in every exodus amen there was
[41:32] also the murder of children amen it
[41:34] would cause a chaos it would cause an
[41:36] upheaval it would cause amen people to
[41:39] wonder what is going on amen what is
[41:41] happening amen in the first exodus we
[41:43] could read a darkness that actually
[41:46] could be felt we could read it in exodus
[41:48] 10 verse 21 it says the lord said unto
[41:51] moses stretch out thy hand towards
[41:53] heaven and there may be darkness over
[41:55] the land of egypt even darkness which
[41:58] may be felt in other words that you
[42:00] would have to grope or try to make your
[42:03] own way through because you have no life
[42:05] but they said and they saw not one
[42:07] another and he wrote neither rose any of
[42:09] his place for three days but all the
[42:11] children of israel had light in their
[42:14] dwellings
[42:15] hallelujah amen we can read in matthew
[42:18] 27 and verse 45 at the second exodus now
[42:21] from the sixth hour there was darkness
[42:24] over all the land until the ninth hour
[42:27] now not only is it a physical darkness
[42:30] but there's also a spiritual darkness we
[42:33] can see the spiritual darkness that was
[42:34] taking place in the first exodus we can
[42:37] see the spiritual darkness that was
[42:39] going on in the second exodus and and
[42:41] for us to come to our exodus in our time
[42:44] we cannot expect there not to be chaos
[42:47] we cannot expect there not to be
[42:49] darkness around us we cannot expect that
[42:52] there won't be troubles on every hand
[42:54] but we can expect there will be light
[42:57] there'll be light to guide us and delete
[42:59] us no matter where we're at no matter
[43:01] what we're going through no matter what
[43:03] kind of troubles we're facing what kind
[43:05] of obstacles amen there's a light on our
[43:08] path that is guiding us day by day and
[43:11] this light is not a light that we got to
[43:13] worry about going out amen these lights
[43:15] up here you got to worry about it they
[43:17] got a time they got an expiration date
[43:19] there's a time that they're going to
[43:20] they're going to end because they're
[43:22] man-made amen the lights at your home
[43:24] wherever the lights on your car amen how
[43:26] many has replaced them you had to
[43:27] replace them because they have an
[43:29] expiration time amen but the light that
[43:32] we're being guided by does not have an
[43:35] expiration time it's an eternal light
[43:38] amen therefore it has eternal benefits
[43:40] amen you don't have to worry about
[43:42] getting in the valley of darkness and
[43:44] running out of light
[43:45] amen because there is a shadow in there
[43:48] so if there's a shadow in there that
[43:50] means there has to be light and the
[43:52] light is shining no matter how bad the
[43:54] darkness is no matter how much the
[43:57] problems around you god is calling us
[44:00] out of darkness and into light
[44:03] but there's going to be chaos
[44:05] during these times and we've seen it we
[44:08] see it arising more and more very
[44:10] rapidly as we're going on in the time
[44:12] that we're living in amen darkness is
[44:14] getting darker but the light is still
[44:17] there
[44:19] amen we can you know we can find uh
[44:22] you know i happen to just stumble across
[44:24] the video
[44:26] just yesterday of watching a woman get
[44:28] up in protest at her local school board
[44:31] amen about about what they're teaching
[44:33] children and why she had to take her
[44:35] children out and why she's here to fight
[44:37] for the other children and and she's
[44:39] talking about you know when does it
[44:40] become right that we teach our children
[44:43] amen to be something that they're not
[44:46] that we begin to tell them that they're
[44:48] a boy when they're a girl or we allow
[44:50] them amen to make a decision when she
[44:52] said god made that decision for them and
[44:55] she said you know just the other day and
[44:56] she made this statement i never heard
[44:58] about this but it shows you the oncoming
[45:00] darkness and the darkness that is
[45:02] pushing and it's coming and it's going
[45:04] amen she said she said you know just the
[45:06] other day one of our substitute teachers
[45:08] was fired because a little girl came up
[45:11] and meowed at her and she wouldn't be
[45:12] out back amen because this little girl
[45:15] had been taught that if she identified
[45:16] as a cat it was okay to be a cat
[45:19] how far are we going to go with these
[45:21] things
[45:21] darkness is pushing amen but there's
[45:24] still light
[45:25] amen it's not amen there's still good
[45:28] christian people that'll get up there
[45:29] and oppose that darkness amen amen see
[45:32] we're facing in this year amen we're
[45:34] facing both darkness and light
[45:37] amen we're in one of the most chaotic
[45:40] times of darkness that we've ever a man
[45:42] has ever stood in amen i want to say
[45:45] it's even greater than the first exit
[45:47] this was it's greater than the second
[45:49] exodus was we're in the darkest time
[45:52] amen that man has ever stood in yet
[45:54] we're also standing right now in the
[45:57] most blessed light that's ever shown
[46:02] right in the middle of chaos amen
[46:04] darkness all around and problems all
[46:06] around amen we're standing also in the
[46:09] most blessed light
[46:11] amen
[46:13] the light of the revealed word of the
[46:15] hour that is shining upon our pathway
[46:18] and showing us where we're at amen we're
[46:20] not a deceived people amen we're walking
[46:22] by the word of god and we're working
[46:24] towards a rapture
[46:26] [Applause]
[46:29] but just like in the beginning there was
[46:31] gross darkness upon the earth but the
[46:33] spirit of god amen began to move upon
[46:36] the face of the water and when that
[46:38] spirit began to move a voice spoke and
[46:41] said let there be light
[46:44] why did the light have to come because
[46:46] those seeds that were laying there in
[46:48] that in that earth could not come to
[46:51] fruition until the light began to shine
[46:53] upon it
[46:55] amen so the light had to shine it had to
[46:57] come amen it had to come over the earth
[47:00] and begin to pull out amen the sunflower
[47:02] seeds and the rose seeds and the pine
[47:04] trees and and this this guy this grass
[47:07] and that grass and this life and that
[47:09] life amen life coming from the sun
[47:13] from the light of god and god separated
[47:15] the light from the darkness you know and
[47:17] i he said i believe we're living in that
[47:20] hour again when god is separating light
[47:23] from darkness
[47:28] you know jesus made a really profound
[47:29] statement he said be careful that the
[47:31] light that's within you is not darkness
[47:36] amen because satan portrays himself as
[47:38] an angel of light
[47:40] amen so he's separating again the light
[47:43] from the darkness
[47:45] there's many lights but there's only one
[47:47] true light
[47:49] amen that's even
[47:51] we can talk like we said about the bowl
[47:52] but that's also spiritually speaking
[47:55] there's many lights but there's only one
[47:57] true light
[47:58] amen that's the word of god and what's
[48:00] been vindicated in this hour amen when
[48:03] god is separating it and he's pressing
[48:05] it from the other side of the world that
[48:07] the light might be made manifest
[48:10] and he said that's the reason i can say
[48:12] to the church in the middle of all this
[48:15] chaos shalom
[48:18] amen to them because that is god's peace
[48:24] mercy you mean in the middle of the
[48:26] chaos that's around me all the things
[48:29] that we went through this even this last
[48:30] two years and it seems like it's not
[48:33] getting any better
[48:34] it seems like things are getting worse
[48:35] than they are seems like darkness is
[48:37] getting bad and it's worse than it is
[48:39] amen it seems like things are just
[48:42] moving at warp speed and we're trying to
[48:44] in the middle of all this i can have
[48:46] peace yeah you can have peace he said
[48:50] that's what i want to bring to you for
[48:52] this year and i i want to bring it on to
[48:54] 2022.
[48:56] amen that's what i want to bring for
[48:58] this year not looking back
[49:01] we're not looking back
[49:02] we're not even going to look back and
[49:04] say how bad it's been we're going to
[49:06] look forward and say how good it's about
[49:08] to be
[49:10] amen looking forward we're looking
[49:12] forward to the breaking of a new day
[49:15] there's something great laying just
[49:17] ahead of us where years has been the joy
[49:19] that we've been looking forward to the
[49:21] pressing the coming of that great
[49:24] eternal light
[49:28] hallelujah we're right at the moment of
[49:30] the breaking of the light across that
[49:33] horizontal realm and it's going to break
[49:35] between mortal and immortality we're
[49:38] seeing it break between heavens and
[49:40] earth we're seeing from our earth brown
[49:42] sickness in the troubled world into a
[49:44] bright and shining day of immortal life
[49:47] and immortal body and immortal earth and
[49:50] it shall never pass away that's why we
[49:53] can say shalom
[49:57] it's a light time for the believers
[50:00] but it grows darkness
[50:02] for the world
[50:05] and they don't know what's happening
[50:07] they're wandering they're shaking in
[50:08] their boots
[50:13] you know it's like the jews prophesied
[50:16] or the jews within the days that jesus
[50:17] came upon the earth
[50:19] isaiah had prophesied
[50:21] that they would have eyes but they
[50:23] couldn't see
[50:24] ears but they couldn't hear
[50:27] it's a reason jesus would pray for their
[50:29] forgiveness
[50:30] because that was a way to fulfill the
[50:32] scripture it's returned again
[50:35] the bible spoke about the day we live in
[50:38] gross darkness upon the people
[50:40] amen but there's something simply that
[50:42] people want but they just can't get
[50:46] nicodemus would even express it before
[50:48] the lord rabbi we know that thou art a
[50:50] teacher come from god but no man can do
[50:53] the things you do if god wasn't with him
[50:55] but it was a darkness upon the jewish
[50:57] race that the messiah might come and
[51:00] take a gentile for a bride they had to
[51:03] reject him
[51:05] but also it's going to be the opposite
[51:07] way
[51:08] amen darkness is coming now upon the
[51:10] gentiles so he can go back to the jews
[51:13] again
[51:15] amen
[51:17] jesus came the first time it was a time
[51:19] of great darkness and chaos
[51:22] amen could you go back to moses the
[51:24] first exodus could you imagine the chaos
[51:27] that was upon that land when you had
[51:28] three days of solid darkness
[51:33] i mean they didn't have street lights
[51:34] like maybe we have street lights and
[51:36] lights on their carriages or chariots
[51:38] like we have lights on ours
[51:40] you know they didn't have it maybe in
[51:42] their homes it was a darkness that could
[51:43] be felt
[51:45] i believe we're there again we have a
[51:47] darkness that can be felt
[51:50] amen you feel it all around you pushing
[51:53] in on every hand amen could you imagine
[51:55] the chaos as it was happening as those
[51:57] babies were getting killed and thrown to
[52:00] the crocodiles and and they're wondering
[52:02] what's taking place what in the world's
[52:03] going on and all the while god's words
[52:06] being fulfilled
[52:08] i mean so a light could come and shine a
[52:11] deliverer could come and bring
[52:13] deliverance to god's people amen in the
[52:16] middle of chaos in the middle of
[52:19] destruction seem like it hope is gone
[52:21] and it's impossible anymore we've held
[52:24] on for 400 years but now it just seems
[52:26] impossible and there's a baby floating
[52:28] on a little basket going down a nile
[52:30] river and angels are guarding it and
[52:32] watching over and sitting on top of it
[52:35] striking crocodiles with swords they're
[52:37] not seeing none of that but it's
[52:38] happening and god's got a seed amen for
[52:41] a certain purpose that a light can shine
[52:44] in the middle of darkness that it would
[52:46] set god's people free
[52:50] then you come down to the second exit
[52:52] the same thing chaos everywhere romans
[52:54] over overlording the people taxes and
[52:57] and burdens and things that was going on
[52:59] and problems and why why's it gotta be
[53:02] like this
[53:03] meanwhile there's a little little donkey
[53:05] on his way to bethlehem
[53:08] and there's a light shining up there but
[53:10] nobody's paying attention to the light
[53:11] all they can see is the darkness
[53:17] jesus came first time in the great
[53:20] darkness and chaos
[53:22] and the world rejected him
[53:24] but there was a group that caught it
[53:30] listen god don't have an exodus unless
[53:31] he's got a people foreign exodus
[53:34] amen so we're coming down to the third
[53:37] exodus he don't have a exodus if there
[53:39] ain't a people for an exodus so to have
[53:42] an exodus he's got to have a people so
[53:44] there has to be someone in this dark
[53:46] laodicean age that we're living in now
[53:49] uh what you say we're now past even what
[53:52] the prophet lived
[53:53] past his death what he lived
[53:57] it's pretty mind-blowing
[53:59] raise our hands how many thought we'd
[54:00] still be here
[54:04] now
[54:06] the hour is dark
[54:09] gross darkness is on the people
[54:12] i mean to the point that our little
[54:14] children can now identify they want to
[54:16] identify as a cat we got to meow back to
[54:18] them
[54:21] hello
[54:23] they want to be a girl and they're a boy
[54:25] then we got to put up with it
[54:29] gross darkness
[54:32] where are we standing what does it all
[54:34] mean what hour are we in how close are
[54:37] we to the coming of the lord
[54:41] what does it mean god has begun to
[54:44] separate the light from the darkness
[54:46] pressing actually because the reason the
[54:49] darkness is getting worse is because the
[54:52] light is pressing
[54:54] from the other side it's pressing and
[54:57] it's pressing and it's going to break
[54:59] through to a new day again
[55:02] oh hallelujah
[55:04] light is beginning to be pushed into the
[55:06] darkness like he did at the beginning to
[55:08] show the dawn of a new day the church
[55:10] ages are fading now that the god is
[55:13] pressing the darkness into a place
[55:18] the world is covering it up worldlyism
[55:20] is taking the thing chaos everywhere
[55:22] dressing and acting and and carrying on
[55:25] like nothing is going on he says you are
[55:28] not of the world little children ye are
[55:30] of heaven this is not your home
[55:35] hallelujah
[55:36] why why would we want to try to worry
[55:39] about this whole place this is not our
[55:41] home
[55:48] the hour is pressing darkness is
[55:50] pressing
[55:51] but so is light
[55:53] gross darkness was blind in israel for
[55:56] the lighting to fall upon the gentiles
[55:59] now it's blind in the gentiles so it
[56:01] could fall the light can fall on israel
[56:03] just like the day and night one side has
[56:06] darkness the other side has light
[56:08] and then light comes over to the other
[56:10] side and then it goes back to the other
[56:12] side
[56:14] the church the bride is making herself
[56:16] ready it's time for the rapture
[56:21] for darkness is fading from the gentiles
[56:24] to dawn upon the jews
[56:30] the sun has traveled from the east to
[56:32] the west
[56:33] and it's going back around light can
[56:35] only do one thing go back
[56:37] to the other side light can only go back
[56:39] to the east again back to israel
[56:41] god blinded them for a little while but
[56:44] darkness is now coming now upon the
[56:46] gentiles so light can come to them
[56:49] you know we can read about the darkness
[56:51] that's upon us in zephaniah 1 and verse
[56:53] 14. it says the great day of the lord is
[56:56] near how many rejoice in that
[57:01] hallelujah you say well brother brother
[57:04] this has been like thousands of years
[57:05] this was prophesied was so was it also
[57:08] hundreds of years that had been
[57:09] prophesied behold a virgin shall
[57:11] conceive
[57:12] amen in that word brother branham said
[57:14] left that prophet's mouth and began to
[57:16] search for a vessel
[57:19] until 600 years later it found a virgin
[57:23] it could rest inside of
[57:25] and light began to come to a darkened
[57:27] world amen amen this has been spoken
[57:29] thousands years ago but this word has
[57:32] been looking for a vessel
[57:35] it's been looking for a people ready for
[57:37] the great day of the lord
[57:42] it is near and hastened greatly even the
[57:45] voice of the day of the lord the mighty
[57:48] man shall cry there bitterly
[57:51] that day listen to the great day of the
[57:53] lord that day is a day of wrath
[57:57] well check
[57:59] we've seen that
[58:00] it's a day of rep people losing their
[58:03] minds
[58:06] out in the streets riding breaking stuff
[58:08] turning over this burning down buildings
[58:11] a day of wrath
[58:13] it's a day of trouble
[58:15] and distress
[58:16] it's a day of wastedness and desolation
[58:20] it's a day of darkness and gloominess
[58:23] it's a day of clouds and thick darkness
[58:29] but it's a day of the trumpet and an
[58:32] alarm against fence cities
[58:37] alarm against the fifth cities and
[58:40] against the high towers and i will bring
[58:42] distress upon men that they shall walk
[58:45] like blind men
[58:48] like blind men because they have sinned
[58:51] against the lord and their blood shall
[58:53] be poured out as dust and their flesh as
[58:56] the dung
[58:59] and neither their silver nor their gold
[59:02] shall be able to deliver them in the day
[59:05] of the lord's wrath
[59:07] but the whole land shall be devoured by
[59:10] the fire of his jealousy for he shall
[59:12] make even a speedy riddance of all of
[59:15] him that dwell in the land
[59:19] hallelujah their fenced cities are not
[59:22] going to keep them it's not going to
[59:24] help them their high towers it's not
[59:26] going to keep them it won't keep you
[59:28] either the only thing that'll keep you
[59:30] is the true light of this hour and
[59:32] that's the word of almighty god
[59:35] [Applause]
[59:36] amen our silver our gold our riches of
[59:40] this place it won't do us a bit of good
[59:45] there's only one thing that will
[59:48] there's darkness
[59:49] but there's light
[59:51] there's chaos but there's peace
[59:55] mercy he said gross darkness would be
[59:58] upon the people but there would be light
[1:00:00] rise and shine for thy light has come
[1:00:06] the greatest time light can shine is in
[1:00:09] darkness
[1:00:11] amen you could take that match and take
[1:00:13] it out there in the middle of the day
[1:00:14] and it won't hardly do anything
[1:00:16] but you bring it in place of darkness
[1:00:18] it'll light up just a little match and
[1:00:21] you add another match to that another
[1:00:23] match to that and pretty soon you got a
[1:00:24] bonfire and it lights further and it
[1:00:26] lights further the bigger the fire gets
[1:00:28] the fire that's why in our churches i
[1:00:30] believe we ought to light the biggest
[1:00:32] fire we can get
[1:00:34] amen i'm not interested in a little bit
[1:00:35] of kindling or a little bit of spark i
[1:00:37] want everything god's got i want the
[1:00:40] spirit of god moving upon our midst and
[1:00:42] so that in the middle of our chaos the
[1:00:45] word of god can speak and say let there
[1:00:47] be light
[1:00:50] and when the word goes forth and that
[1:00:52] light goes forward it drives back
[1:00:54] suicide spirits it drives back spirits
[1:00:57] of this world and things off of our
[1:00:59] young people and it breaks chains of
[1:01:02] darkness
[1:01:05] this is why we got to have that spirit
[1:01:07] of god moving
[1:01:13] rise and shine for thy light has come
[1:01:16] how can there be darkness and light it
[1:01:18] has to be separated
[1:01:21] the only thing that's separated is the
[1:01:23] word manifest
[1:01:25] the darkness on the earth but when the
[1:01:27] manifested word of god the sun which is
[1:01:30] spoken to existence by the word
[1:01:33] shows itself darkness
[1:01:35] runs to the other side
[1:01:38] oh i love that you know again when you
[1:01:40] get up in the morning and you see that
[1:01:41] sun peeking over you know what that's
[1:01:43] saying
[1:01:44] i'm still here
[1:01:46] i am the very spoken word of almighty
[1:01:48] god spoken who knows how many years ago
[1:01:51] amen been spoken there and it was been
[1:01:53] burning and stayed in that position held
[1:01:56] by what not man's ideas not scientific
[1:01:59] on uh achievements none of that it's
[1:02:01] held there by the word of god
[1:02:04] and it's showing you the word of god
[1:02:06] still has power over darkness it has
[1:02:09] power over chaos it has power over
[1:02:12] everything that was there upon the earth
[1:02:14] but when the sun came up it's showing
[1:02:16] you i still have power
[1:02:20] hallelujah and this word has risen in
[1:02:23] this day not man's theology not man's
[1:02:26] ideas not man's creeds not some
[1:02:29] kentuckian preacher it was god's word
[1:02:32] made
[1:02:32] manifest and it's showing i still have
[1:02:36] power i still have power over sickness i
[1:02:39] still have power over diseases i still
[1:02:41] have power every every demonic
[1:02:43] oppression
[1:02:52] darkness is trying to push
[1:02:54] it's why you feel like it i feel like
[1:02:56] the way you do
[1:02:57] it's why the nerves try to raise up
[1:03:00] and the worry tries to come in
[1:03:02] it's darkness
[1:03:04] it's why it tries to get you to take a

[1:03:08] that's why it tries to come over you and
[1:03:10] take make you take your life it's
[1:03:11] darkness

[1:04:04] night god will send the wind of the holy
[1:04:06] spirit and it'll blow those clouds back

[1:04:11] life and say yes lord the esower is

[1:04:29] but to the church the bride shalom
[1:04:33] which is god's peace
[1:04:36] you know
[1:04:37] people get the wrong idea about peace

[1:05:14] bad day i'm going through this and i did
[1:05:16] this and this one over here and i don't
[1:05:17] want i'm a can i hardly made a church
[1:05:20] well how do you do
[1:05:25] peace
[1:05:28] it's not a temporary thing
[1:05:30] it's an eternal thing
[1:05:32] when we see darkness settle in
[1:05:35] darkness just before the day we know the
[1:05:37] morning star is hanging to introduce to
[1:05:39] come inside it's always darkest just a
[1:05:41] few moments for the day
[1:05:43] the darkest before the day because the
[1:05:45] light is pressing the darkness
[1:05:48] but the morning star comes out and says
[1:05:50] good morning
[1:05:52] shalom
[1:05:53] that's him among us
[1:05:56] hallelujah his word being identified
[1:05:58] shalom the great day is fixing to break
[1:06:02] and when it breaks eternal bright and
[1:06:04] fair and his chosen one shall gather in
[1:06:06] their home beyond the sky when the roll
[1:06:08] is called up yonder i'll be there our
[1:06:11] names are on his book we'll be there
[1:06:15] doesn't matter what the darkness says it
[1:06:17] doesn't matter what the chaos says and
[1:06:20] my name is written in glory
[1:06:27] isaiah says arise and shine
[1:06:31] the light has come
[1:06:34] the word light
[1:06:35] is vindicated again
[1:06:38] light has been vindicated again god's
[1:06:40] word is vindicated again
[1:06:42] so when you see god manifesting his
[1:06:44] promise of the light of the day
[1:06:47] or the word given to this age you see
[1:06:49] the promises being manifested it's
[1:06:51] showing you peace
[1:06:53] good morning
[1:06:55] i'm here i haven't forsaken you that
[1:06:58] great light that hung in the wilderness
[1:07:00] amen that moses when moses forsook egypt
[1:07:02] that steamed their approach of christ
[1:07:04] greater than treasures in egypt that
[1:07:06] same light was the same light that he
[1:07:09] followed was the same light that met
[1:07:11] paul on the road down to damascus that
[1:07:13] great light hung before him amen that
[1:07:16] they said i'm jesus amen i want jesus i
[1:07:19] come from god i go to god that same
[1:07:21] light has come to what to manifest to
[1:07:24] make known to the people the promises
[1:07:26] he's made for this day manifested light
[1:07:30] of the day
[1:07:31] and while it's amazing the people of god
[1:07:33] gets more light the dark gets more dark
[1:07:43] that's what he said the darkness is
[1:07:45] darkened
[1:07:47] it gets more dark
[1:07:50] because the light is pressing
[1:07:53] it's pressing
[1:07:56] it's pressing he said well brother
[1:07:58] timothy i thought the darkness was
[1:07:59] pressing no
[1:08:00] actually the light is pressing
[1:08:03] it's not darkness it's light
[1:08:06] light from that other realm is pressing
[1:08:08] against the darkness in this realm and
[1:08:10] the dark is getting darker
[1:08:13] and it's getting darker and it's getting
[1:08:15] darker but that just means the light on
[1:08:18] the other side is getting closer and
[1:08:20] closer and closer and closer and closer
[1:08:24] until finally that darkness can't hold
[1:08:27] it no more
[1:08:28] it's held it for now for 2 000 years and
[1:08:31] it's now past the prophet more than he
[1:08:33] lived amen but darkness is getting
[1:08:35] darker and darker but why the light is
[1:08:37] getting closer and closer and closer
[1:08:40] amen we're one year closer than we was
[1:08:43] last year we're one day today closer
[1:08:45] than we was yesterday amen we're one
[1:08:47] hour closer than when we started service
[1:08:50] we're closer and closer and closer till
[1:08:53] one day
[1:08:54] boom
[1:08:56] light's going to shine like it's never
[1:08:58] shown before and that eternal round
[1:09:00] gonna break into this rail and we're
[1:09:02] going to be with him forever
[1:09:05] in the middle of chaos
[1:09:15] rise and shine
[1:09:17] for the light is coming to you
[1:09:22] john the baptist in his day in the
[1:09:24] middle of darkness would rise
[1:09:26] and he would shine the light of the hour
[1:09:28] as one crying in the wilderness
[1:09:31] behold i send my messenger before me to
[1:09:33] prepare the way of the lord
[1:09:38] jesus would say you did walk in his
[1:09:40] light he was a bride and shining light
[1:09:44] then that light went out
[1:09:48] and now there's another light
[1:09:51] and many of them refuse to see
[1:09:54] that great light that came down even the
[1:09:57] ones that walk with john
[1:10:00] others that was around many scholars and
[1:10:02] things and people that you would have
[1:10:03] thought would definitely would have knew
[1:10:05] when the scripture was being revealed
[1:10:06] and the prophets isaiah's message was
[1:10:08] being foretold or being fulfilled and
[1:10:11] and a virgin was
[1:10:13] given birth and things were mysteriously
[1:10:15] surely those would have knew it
[1:10:18] but the darkness was too great
[1:10:21] there wasn't in the light
[1:10:23] but there was a couple of fishermen out
[1:10:24] on a boat
[1:10:26] and they was having a bad day
[1:10:29] i had been fishing and couldn't catch
[1:10:31] nothing and this you know chaos all
[1:10:33] around and been working all day and it
[1:10:34] was just so stupid my work i'll tell you
[1:10:36] what i'm getting so sick and tired of it
[1:10:38] and all of a sudden light comes walking
[1:10:44] light comes walking he said can i borrow
[1:10:46] your boat for a minute
[1:10:49] peter said yeah i can you know we know
[1:10:51] he
[1:10:51] maybe he did throw a little fit i don't
[1:10:53] know what he did but jesus got in his
[1:10:55] boat and began to teach and then he
[1:10:56] turns around and says cast out go out
[1:10:58] into the deep and cast your net for the
[1:11:01] drought
[1:11:04] what happened light began to shine
[1:11:06] they began to shine in their little
[1:11:08] boats
[1:11:09] amen they had been walking around down
[1:11:11] the shore she's the seashores of galilee
[1:11:13] some were seeing it some the darkness
[1:11:15] was getting darker
[1:11:17] some the light was dawning upon them and
[1:11:19] he steps into that boat and light began
[1:11:21] to shine in that boat in the middle of
[1:11:22] chaotic day in the middle of chaos
[1:11:25] amendment to where peter would have to
[1:11:27] say ain't nobody could do what he did
[1:11:29] but what but god
[1:11:31] amen he had to recognize this has to be
[1:11:33] my god it has to be jehovah only he
[1:11:36] could create we've been fishing we've
[1:11:38] not been trying we've been we've been
[1:11:40] doing what we could do but he told us to
[1:11:42] throw on the other side and now we got
[1:11:43] not enough for our boat we got enough
[1:11:45] for two votes
[1:11:47] he's that kind of god
[1:11:58] amen the light's shining
[1:12:00] what about this new year we're facing
[1:12:02] brother timothy where are we going
[1:12:03] what's going to happen it's going to get
[1:12:05] darker
[1:12:09] that gives me the fields of goods
[1:12:14] it's going to get darker
[1:12:16] it's like i said even in 2020 people
[1:12:18] were saying you know hey i can't wait
[1:12:20] till 2021. well who said it's going to
[1:12:22] be any better
[1:12:24] and it wasn't any better
[1:12:26] and then we came you know now we've got
[1:12:27] 2022.
[1:12:31] is it
[1:12:32] 2022
[1:12:37] is it going to get any better brother
[1:12:38] timothy no it's going to get darker
[1:12:42] it's going to get worse
[1:12:44] things are going to come even worse as
[1:12:46] we go into the into the darkness is
[1:12:48] going but it's in the in the middle of
[1:12:50] all of that chaos in the middle of all
[1:12:53] the darkness the way
[1:12:54] i want you to catch something the world
[1:12:57] is going to get worse
[1:13:00] the world is going to get worse you
[1:13:03] might be in the world but you're not of
[1:13:04] the world because in your dwelling
[1:13:07] in your dwelling there's a great light
[1:13:09] that shines and it's not a temporary
[1:13:11] light that goes out when it gets darker
[1:13:13] it's an eternal light
[1:13:16] and it does not matter how many devils
[1:13:18] rise up and begins to blow against it
[1:13:21] and howl against it this light is an
[1:13:23] eternal light
[1:13:27] it's a great light
[1:13:31] he says this is what even brother brown
[1:13:32] would say in 64.
[1:13:34] he says what's going to be darkness
[1:13:37] darkness
[1:13:38] to light
[1:13:40] darkness is going to get worse
[1:13:42] a new year a new year brother what about
[1:13:45] it
[1:13:46] it brings new hope
[1:13:50] what
[1:13:51] you said it's gonna get worse
[1:13:53] it brings new hope
[1:13:54] we're one year closer
[1:13:58] we're one day closer we're one hour
[1:14:01] closer you know he said it's like a man
[1:14:03] one morning he said i heard it man went
[1:14:05] out early picked up his paper come back
[1:14:07] sat down kicked his feet up on the on on
[1:14:09] the recliner put his glasses on began to
[1:14:11] read his wife was getting breakfast said
[1:14:13] john anything new
[1:14:15] he said no same old thing just new
[1:14:18] people yep that's right murders rapes
[1:14:20] everything somebody but just somebody
[1:14:22] else done it it's true he said but this
[1:14:24] new year we're not just turning a new
[1:14:27] page we're turning back to the word
[1:14:29] again to see what the word has promised
[1:14:32] for this day that the light of this day
[1:14:34] can grow greater and brighter in our
[1:14:37] lives
[1:14:39] in the middle of chaos
[1:14:43] it ain't changing pages or changing
[1:14:45] calendars
[1:14:47] it's moving towards him
[1:14:49] forgetting those things that are behind
[1:14:51] pressing towards the mark of the high
[1:14:53] calling
[1:14:58] you know what makes demons scream
[1:15:01] it ain't the darkness
[1:15:03] they've been comfortable in the dark
[1:15:06] they've enjoyed it they've been they've
[1:15:07] hid in the dark places but what would
[1:15:10] make a demon scream is light
[1:15:13] when that light stepped off that boat
[1:15:15] over onto the land that the maniac was
[1:15:17] on he'd been living out there for a
[1:15:18] while and maybe you know whatever going
[1:15:21] on just demons having their own way
[1:15:23] doing their own thing but when that
[1:15:25] light stepped off onto that land
[1:15:28] they begin to scream they begin to howl
[1:15:30] they begin to cross a ruckus amen even
[1:15:32] you've seen it in our camps what caused
[1:15:34] that not darkness
[1:15:36] light light exposes them it shows amen
[1:15:40] that the power of light is always
[1:15:42] greater than the darkness they can hide
[1:15:44] in the deep crevices of life of darkest
[1:15:47] moments and darkest times amen a
[1:15:50] psychiatrist or a psychologist can never
[1:15:52] get there but that light can get there
[1:15:54] it can get to those places you may not
[1:15:56] even know about we can see it and amen
[1:15:58] in brother branham's ministry he'd go
[1:16:00] back in lives and begin to discern hey
[1:16:02] man that wasn't psychology there was a
[1:16:04] light and that light was shining into a
[1:16:07] darkness and saying that's where that
[1:16:09] devil attached itself to and that light
[1:16:12] would expose that darkness and that
[1:16:14] darkness would have to flee
[1:16:24] but truly
[1:16:26] darkness is going to get worse
[1:16:28] on the world
[1:16:30] it's going to push
[1:16:32] and seemingly get greater and worse but
[1:16:35] if you'll put it in your mind
[1:16:37] it's truly light pushing against it
[1:16:41] it's only another day closer to the
[1:16:44] coming of the lord
[1:16:45] and that light has moved into that
[1:16:47] darkness and that darkness is screaming
[1:16:49] and hollering and chaos is breaking out
[1:16:52] and things because it knows
[1:16:54] it's just about to lose all power
[1:16:58] it's about to lose all power hey man we
[1:17:01] can go let me go down for a second amen
[1:17:03] the rising of the sun
[1:17:05] he said
[1:17:06] he says let me hold on let me get to the
[1:17:08] place
[1:17:11] before i get there i'm gonna stop here
[1:17:12] for a minute and shalom again he said
[1:17:14] we're creatures of time he's a god of
[1:17:16] eternity
[1:17:18] he says see
[1:17:19] he says see he's he's coming it's
[1:17:21] pushing he said just commit yourself to
[1:17:24] him look up shine with the joy of the
[1:17:26] lord know that you've been privileged
[1:17:29] your eyes have come open to see the day
[1:17:31] we're here trust in him for the future
[1:17:37] no matter how dark it is trust in him
[1:17:39] he's the god he'll get you through it
[1:17:41] you've seen him vindicate his word in

[1:22:00] the earth was god's spoken word
[1:22:02] the first light that ever struck the
[1:22:04] earth was god's spoken word he said let
[1:22:06] there be light and it turned darkness
[1:22:08] into light
[1:22:11] in order to bring forth the creation of
[1:22:13] joy and life on the earth then the
[1:22:14] spirit of god as it moved in love and
[1:22:17] compassion on that great day that first
[1:22:19] day of dawn as it began to sweep over
[1:22:21] the earth the sun rose it's raised and
[1:22:24] it dried up the waters and made an
[1:22:25] atmosphere above
[1:22:27] it'll bring joy and life to the earth
[1:22:29] what a great hour
[1:22:31] what a great hour
[1:22:33] he said but that wasn't nothing to the
[1:22:35] sunrise on that easter morning
[1:22:38] this time when the sun leap into the
[1:22:40] skies it brought forth a greater sunrise
[1:22:44] a greater light was brought forth amen a
[1:22:47] greater light to overcome a greater
[1:22:49] darkness because it was great news the
[1:22:52] s-o-n is up he has risen he is quickened
[1:22:56] from the dead and he has raised over
[1:22:58] every devil in hell over every power of
[1:23:00] satan over a spirit that wants to come
[1:23:03] against you he's raised up against it
[1:23:05] he's raised up over it
[1:23:10] first time sun rose in genesis is
[1:23:12] bringing a message
[1:23:14] there's life coming
[1:23:16] and this time when the sun rose
[1:23:18] it was again it was a dual sun rising
[1:23:22] another sun rising
[1:23:24] not only the s-u-n
[1:23:26] it was the esso wind
[1:23:29] it's risen to bring eternal life to
[1:23:32] god's eternal seed
[1:23:36] that by foreknowledge he's seen them
[1:23:38] laying in the earth
[1:23:42] oh yeah satan tried to cover you up with
[1:23:44] darkness
[1:23:45] god somehow destroy your lives with your
[1:23:47] family troubles and things and
[1:23:49] as young kids and try to destroy you
[1:23:52] but light shined on you
[1:23:54] and it brought you out of that darkness
[1:23:59] you know i always thought i've said this
[1:24:00] before but i always thought it was
[1:24:02] amazing of how
[1:24:04] in the middle of a concrete jungle
[1:24:07] that in the middle of concrete that this
[1:24:09] little blade of grass
[1:24:11] can come up and begin to break up
[1:24:13] concrete
[1:24:15] and break it apart
[1:24:17] and
[1:24:18] you know why because it was
[1:24:20] predestinated to life one
[1:24:22] but two there was a power that began to
[1:24:24] draw it
[1:24:25] out of the earth
[1:24:27] down where it was planted however many
[1:24:29] thousands of years ago or however many
[1:24:31] whatever before the before the concrete
[1:24:33] was put on it that germ of life was
[1:24:35] destined for life and so there wasn't
[1:24:38] nothing that the concrete could do about
[1:24:39] it
[1:24:41] it tried to try to compress itself and
[1:24:43] tried to hold it it tried to re-put
[1:24:45] rebar in it try to do everything he
[1:24:47] could but it couldn't keep that life
[1:24:49] from coming up because there was a sun
[1:24:51] that was greater than the concrete
[1:24:54] it had a greater drawing power than the
[1:24:56] concrete had a holding power
[1:24:59] hallelujah and when this sun began to
[1:25:01] rise on eternal seas laying in darkness
[1:25:04] under the concrete of sin and the
[1:25:06] conquer the devil said you know what i
[1:25:08] got him there ain't no way in the world
[1:25:09] he's coming out of that fence city ain't
[1:25:11] nowhere in the world he's coming out of
[1:25:13] that problem ain't nowhere in the world
[1:25:15] he's going to rise up out of there but
[1:25:17] the s-o-n began to rise
[1:25:19] he forgot about that but he also forgot
[1:25:22] that inside that seed was an eternal
[1:25:24] german side of there and the sun began
[1:25:27] to pull and that sun's drawing power was
[1:25:30] greater than the sin's holding power
[1:25:34] oh hallelujah i'm so glad his power is
[1:25:38] greater than ever sin greater than ever
[1:25:40] sickness greater than every trouble
[1:25:43] greater than every devil
[1:25:45] i'm looking at seeds that bumped up
[1:25:48] through
[1:25:49] dust and concrete of drugs and alcohol
[1:25:53] and every kind of sin they try to put on
[1:25:55] your life amen homosexual sin every kind
[1:25:58] of thing prostitute every kind of thing
[1:26:01] he tried to lay it on side of it with
[1:26:03] the sun rose
[1:26:04] [Applause]
[1:26:06] there might have been chaos all around
[1:26:08] you but the chaos couldn't stop the sun
[1:26:10] amen the chaos couldn't stop it the
[1:26:13] concrete couldn't keep it
[1:26:15] i'm gonna have a runaway here in a
[1:26:17] minute amen when i think about the power
[1:26:19] of god that rose even on my life
[1:26:26] you might have been in a tomb of
[1:26:28] denominational systems
[1:26:30] been so buried up in there in that
[1:26:31] darkness but the sun rose
[1:26:35] and it began to shine and that light has
[1:26:37] an ability to go down through crevices
[1:26:39] and down through all kinds of stuff and
[1:26:42] through every kind of obstacle and begin
[1:26:44] to draw
[1:26:47] all of a sudden for no reason you
[1:26:48] thought man this can't be the truth
[1:26:51] just i don't seem like out of the blue
[1:26:52] you know this can't be the truth
[1:26:55] something's wrong here man the way the
[1:26:57] church is going what they're doing and
[1:26:58] what they're promoting that ain't the
[1:27:00] word of god there has to be but for
[1:27:02] there to be a false there has to be a
[1:27:03] true what was that that was the sun that
[1:27:05] was drawing you
[1:27:07] you might not could have saw it you may
[1:27:08] not even knew it was there but that son

[1:27:41] of a seed of god that'll keep it from
