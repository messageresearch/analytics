Some moved up a little bit, some moved up a lot more, but we're all coming up growing in his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what's been extended to us in this hour is more of him. So, that's why we've come together this evening is to receive more from the father. Amen. We do have several requests that we want to remember. Um, Brother Josh Puit has a request for Alex and the girls. They're out sick with fevers and congestion. I can say the same for my family, Sister Debbie, and um, David is sick as well. Just asking that the Lord would bring strength back into their bodies. We want to remember um, the Dea Garza family from Lordsburg. I believe that's in New Mexico. Sister Naomi, his um his wife has battled cancer for about five years and has just o just just crossed over to be with the Lord. So we want to remember that family that the Lord would bring them comfort at this time and may his peace may the borders of his garment extend over them today. Let's just sing this. Ask brother Joe if you'd come and open the service for us this evening. Brother Joe, Lord, I lift your name, your holy name. We could say a lot, but if you would come, [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, I lift your name. Your holy name. Jehovah God. Elohim. [Music] [Applause] You're the great I am. You're the reason lamb. Lord, you're my comfort and king. Maybe you just want to slip up your hand as we sing it again. Oh Lord, I lift your name, your holy name. Jehovah God. You're the great I am.

As we do that, we want to make Brother James welcome. Brother James Wilson, it's great to see you again. Glad you're back in the house of the Lord with us. Gate, good to have you with us again tonight. So, we just trust that the Lord will do something for you. We also have a visitor here. Just make you welcome this evening in the house of the Lord. May the presence of the Lord just shine upon us tonight. If you got a need, I believe we serve a living God that can meet that need. He's not just a God of special meetings. But just so you know, tonight's a special meeting. &gt;&gt; So, he can meet your need tonight. So, Father, we come before your throne of mercy and grace tonight. And Lord, we just want to say how thankful we are that our lives have been changed. Lord, our hearts have been turned away from the things of the world. And Lord, they've been turned and pointed to you, Lord, as your prophet would teach us. God, we've been lifted up into heavenly places. What a dimension. What an atmosphere that we as the bride of Christ can live in, Lord. Knowing that there's struggles on this side, but Lord, we're lifted above the struggles. We have an absolute, a top post. We have an anchor, Lord. We have the Holy Spirit in our lives, Lord. Not just on our physical being, but in our souls, Lord, the token life on display. And Father, I'm so thankful tonight to be a child of God. And I just pray for the needs of your people. Lord, you see Brother Aaron over here, Lord, suffering in his body with some issues that kept him from taking a meeting this weekend. But I pray you'll restore strength and health to him, Lord, for the family there that lost a wife and a mother and a friend. May you comfort them during this time, Father. Be a friend that sticks closer than a brother. And Lord, we pray for uh Sister Alex and the baby there, the Puit family that's suffering in sickness, and brother Derek's family, many other families, Lord, who are under the weather this evening. We just ask God you'll just come by their way, Lord. move by their their homes, their addresses tonight. And may the healing angel just stop by and touch them tonight, Father. And we invite you, God, to come and minister to every heart, every life, every need. Lord, use Brother Timothy as he has prepared and studied. Lord, made preparation for tonight. God, may you just speak to us through your word. For we know that thy word is yes and amen to the believer. And we, Lord, we lift our hands and say, "Father, we want more of that word. We want our hearts to be forever changed Lord to be illuminated by your goodness and your mercy. So we just commit the service to you tonight in Jesus name. Amen. Turn around and shake hands with somebody next to you. Welcome to the house of the Lord this evening. Let's sing mighty you are key of G.

Victory today. It is mine. I don't think anything victory today. Sing that first verse to me. Oh, when I woke this morning, I didn't have a doubt. I knew that the Lord would bring me out. So I got down on my knees, said, "Lord, help me. I got to see the victory." Oh, victory is mine. Victory is mine. Victory today. It is mine. My victory. victory today. For I am covered, covered. I'm covered by his blood. I'm walking by faith. I'm living by the cover. Oh yeah. Jesus. Oh, I'm covered. I love I'm covered by his love. I'm walking by. I'm living by his cover. [Music] Covered by his blood. Jesus has me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you tonight. Let's turn to Luke chapter 21. &gt;&gt; Like to say it's good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just come out of these wonderful meetings and believe God done some great things for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're thankful for that. Just looking forward to every testimony and every victory. Amen. So Luke chapter 21 and verse 25 and also Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 28. said, "There shall be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars on the earth, distress of nations, for perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring, men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth. For the powers of heaven shall be shaken." And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when these things to come to pass, then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption drawth nigh. Also, Hebrews chapter 9 verse 28 says, "So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many, and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation." Amen. God bless you. You can be seated this evening. Amen. Just like to take a thought as we follow up these meetings on faith to look or maybe you ask the question, what are you looking at? &gt;&gt; Because you know, as we know in the day and time that we're living in, there's plenty of things to look at. There's plenty of news to watch. There's uh plenty of conspiracy theories as it as it were to get your head into and all kind of things that you can look at. But and we see here that there's going to be there there's things that's happening upon the earth and we can truly say there's distress between nations and there's perplexities. There's the sea and the waves roll it roaring and and it says men's hearts are failing them for fear for their for looking after those things &gt;&gt; there. That's where their attention is upon all the signs and all the things that are taking place. But when these things begin to come to pass, then look up or and lift up your heads for your redemption drawth nigh. Now this look is to wait is I was looking at it in the Bible as a word there that they used for this word look. It means to wait looking forward to the fulfillment of something that you expect to take place. It is to terry and wait with patience and steadfastness to look away from all else and at one object. &gt;&gt; Amen. All else and at one object. And I I trust that you know that one object to look to is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not the word world that we're living in. It's not our government and things around us and all the situation that's going on maybe even in locally in your own life and things. Amen. But to look amen at Jesus. Amen. The author and the finisher of our faith. Just a couple of scriptures as we look into this. Amen. Micah chapter 7 and verse 7 there. It says, "Therefore I will look unto the Lord. I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a promise that is. My God will hear me. Amen. In 2 Corinthians 4:18 says, "While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal." Amen. So that tells me the things that I can see with my eyes here tonight are temporary. This building is temporary. I see this walls. I I see the pull pit. I I see the pews. I see everything around. Amen. And I It's all temporary. But there's something that if we can break into a vision or into the internals, we can see things not with these two eyes, but eyes of faith. And and we can look beyond the walls that are around us and the situations that surround us and and the circumstances that we're have facing us. and and maybe even after these meetings, things you've dealt with and and and and you're looking at things maybe not moving how you thought they would move or or changing exactly how they that you thought. But if you can look beyond what you can see with your eyes and and you can look with eyes of faith. And tonight, if we can look with eyes of faith, we would no doubt see angels. We would we would see God moving on the behalf of his children. We could see angels that are being dispatched. Amen. To to answer the cries of individuals. Amen. Amen. If we could look at that tonight that our hearts won't fail us. Amen. But there would be faith that that would rise up in our hearts. In Proverbs 4 and verse 25, it says, "Let thine eyes look right on." In other words, don't look to the left. We get to it, but don't look to the left or the right. Look right on, and let thy eyelids look straight before thee. Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. Turn not to the right hand nor to the left and remove thy foot from evil. So our eyes are to be steadfast. It's to look at something. It's to Amen. is given to us. Amen. As a guide. Now I I I think if there were there truly was any senses in my life that I would want to the least to lose, it would be my eyesight. I probably I think I could do without feeling maybe or or taste or I've done for years without smell and and and or maybe even without hearing. But to not have your eyesight, to me, that would be one of the worst things to lose. And I I think even greater than that is people who have lost their spiritual eyesight. &gt;&gt; Amen. That they can't really see what is going on in the other realms. That they can't really see that the things that they're seeing with their eyes are only the fulfillment of eternal things are only the fulfillment of prophecies that are taking place all around us. Amen. So when we look at these things, we don't look with eyes of flesh. if we look with eyes of faith. So when you look at your problems, don't look with eyes of flesh. Look with eyes of faith. Amen. That we can see beyond what we can see. And and we can look beyond what we see before us. And we can see a God who is answering our need in spite of what we can see before us. We can see a God who's ministering, a God who's moving, a God who's making a way where there seems to be no way, no matter what our eyes may tell us. Amen. If the children of Israel could have had that kind of eyesight, they wouldn't have murmured. They wouldn't have complained. They wouldn't have made fusses with Moses. If they could have had that spiritual eyesight to see that God had made a promise and he said, "I'm going to take you out of Egypt and I'm going to take you into a land flowing with milk and honey." Amen. If they would have kept their eyes upon that word, they would have not seen or worried about the Red Sea. They wouldn't have worried about the desert. They wouldn't have worried about no food or no water. They would have known their God made a promise and their God was going to take care of that promise. Well, that goes the same for us tonight. If we quit looking at all the things that are around us and all the bad stuff that's stacked up and all the situations and we can say, "God is still God and God is still on the throne. He's still in charge of my situation and he's still taking care of me whether I see him or I don't see him." And I can look to his word and his word is what is true. Amen. In this hour that we're living in and Paul would pick up on this thought a as it were that Solomon would talk about. Let your eyes look right on. He would pick it up and he said, "I count myself not to apprehend in Philippians 3 and verse 13. But this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, I reach forth under those things which are before." Amen. I'm not looking back. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz there is a wrong way. There is a wrong a thing that you things you shouldn't look at. We've heard about it in Lot. Amen. On Sunday about Lot's wife. She looked at something, but she looked at the wrong thing. Amen. She looked at the city and looked at the things she was leaving behind and looked at all the things that was behind her instead of looking at the grace of God that had pulled her out of the fire. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. That's the way you ought to be. Look, you ought to look not look at your past, not look at your past mistakes, not look at your past failures, but look at your God who has grace that pulled you out of fire, pulled you out of sin, pulled you out of unbelief, and put your feet upon something you can stand upon. &gt;&gt; And he said, I press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Cuz he's got his eyes before, not behind. Amen. We don't we're not living life looking in a rearview mirror, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not in this age looking back to the last age. We're looking at the God before us. Amen. That God's leading the way. He says, Brother Brandham uses this. He said, when you hear the word look, it's usually somebody trying to get you to see what they're looking at. And they'll say to you, look, look, look at them. Look at them microphones. Look, look. See, look. It's just drawing your attention somewhere. Like going down a road, somebody might see a certain scene and say, "Look," that expresses something. It's a mountain or maybe it's a cactus or whatever it is. The first thing they say is, "Look, what is it?" Trying to get your attention. Everybody is looking today. Everybody's looking for something. We're looking for something to happen. We We know the world is constantly watching the skies and the radars and and the screens and everything. Every nation for its own defense, you know, has radars and things that they're looking at. They're looking to find something to appear like an atomic missile or something. Then they got something there that go back to the one that's sent this away. See, they're looking for something. Everything is looking. And he talks about how the Ford company is looking to make a better Ford. God bless them. Amen. The Chevrolet is looking to make a better Chevrolet. Phoenix, he says the town there is looking to make a larger and better town. The nation is looking for more territory so it can spread itself out. The church is looking for more members, but the bride, &gt;&gt; but the bride is looking for the coming of her Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, you have to take your eyes off of something to get your eyes on something else. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't look at this speaker here and this pew over here at the same time unless it happens to be lined up. But if you're looking this way, you got to look one way or the other. Amen. This is God doesn't give us that opportunity that we can look at both things at the same time. We have to take our eyes off of something to get it on something else. Amen. So, we have to take our eyes off of what's temporary to get it on what's eternal. &gt;&gt; You cannot look at both things. The Bible says, Amen. Jesus said, "No man can serve two masters." You can't look at two things like that. Amen. With the same eyes and the same hope and the same longing. Listen, I'm not looking for this world to get better. I'm not looking for this world to be a better place to live. What I'm looking for is God to come back and to g get a bride and take us out of this world. &gt;&gt; So, we have to get our eyes off of fear and doubt so you can get your eyes on faith and fulfillment. You got to get your eyes off what the world is doing so you can get your eyes on what God is doing. &gt;&gt; Cuz God is always working. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if you can see him working or not or if you realize he's working or not or if you understand he's working or not. The children of Israel thought for 400 years God is not working. But the whole time God was preparing. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was working behind the scenes. He was bringing this one to this one, this one to this one to this one to this one to one day he got a Amrab and a joed and it had and he brought them together and he got a Moses. &gt;&gt; God was already still working. He wasn't just sitting back twiddling his thumbs for 400 years. No, he was making preparation to bring his children out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; And listen, God has not got seven seven church ages down the road and he's just giving up and he's just sitting back drinking a glass of iced tea. No, he's been preparing things and he's been putting things in place. He's been put putting kingdoms in authority. He's been putting go people in authority and kingdoms, kings and and presidents and everything. Why? To bring a certain atmosphere for a certain time that a bride can leave here. &gt;&gt; So, we got to make sure we don't get our eyes on the wrong thing &gt;&gt; because it's very easy to do. You can start looking at all the doubt around you and all the fear around you, all the problems around you and all the situation and it looks like man it's what happened to Gahhesa, right? Got to looking at all the Syrians and woke up that morning got come out on that balcony with his cup of coffee and he's like, "Man, this this brick street's good. Oh, this is wonderful. What is that?" Elisha, we got problems. Elisha comes out with his cup of coffee and says, "What's the problem?" He sees the same Syrians that his servant sees. &gt;&gt; But they're no problem to him because he knows God's at work. &gt;&gt; And his eyes are not on what the Syrians are doing, but what on God, what God's doing. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Lord, well, hey, don't you see all these Syrians? Don't you see all these problems? Don't you see all these situation? Hey, we just had a wonderful camp meeting. We just had a wonderful time. And I come out here to drink my coffee and it surrounded me. Look, look, it's worse than it ever was. &gt;&gt; It looks more impossible than it ever looked. &gt;&gt; How is this going to happen? Elisha looked at that and said, "Boy, what you need is some eye surgery. What you need to get your eyes off of them Syrians and get your eyes on your God. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Maybe he's talking to somebody tonight. Maybe you come out of them meetings that's been worse than it's ever been. More anxiety, more fear, more this, more whatever. But you need to get your eyes off of what you're going through and get your eyes on God who's going to take you through it. He said, "God, open this boy's eyes." And his eyes popped open. You know, all of a sudden, the Syrians wasn't as big anymore. All of a sudden, he seen hills full of angels and chariots of fire. &gt;&gt; Those angels and chariots are still here, church. &gt;&gt; They've been stationed by you on Monday morning. They was there with you on Tuesday morning. They was here there this morning. &gt;&gt; Come on. They encamp about those that fear him. That's right. &gt;&gt; They ain't left their duties. They ain't left their post. Amen. They're still there. But you got to separate yourself from the doubts. &gt;&gt; You got to separate yourself from the things that wants to pull you away from your eyes being on Jesus Christ and walk with him. It's life to you. &gt;&gt; You know, Abraham did such a thing. 25 years he held on to a promise believing the same promise. He but he had to focus his mind to the will of God by the word of God and believe it. And if we can focus oursel to the plan of God, to what God wants for us and what God promised us, and we let everything else along, no matter how long it is, we just keep believing. &gt;&gt; We just keep believing. That's what believers do. We believe. Amen. Romans 4:14 said he staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief, but was strong in the faith. &gt;&gt; He didn't let unbelief contaminate him. He looked at one thing that was the voice that had spoke to him. &gt;&gt; That's what the church ought to do today. That's what we ought to do today. Look at one thing, the voice. The word of God. &gt;&gt; What does the word say? It speaks. Amen. churches and people can speak any way they want to speak. But what does the voice the word say? Amen. The what are we looking at? He looked at the voice that spoke to him. He called everything contrary to what the voice had spoke. Amen. Yet materially it was so far out of focus of the world as it was in Noah's time. He it didn't focus up with the thoughts of the world. You know, that's why they think we're crazy people because our eyesight don't match up with their eyesight. We see things not quite the same, right? Amen. We see things out there in the world and we say, "Well, that's we see sin. We see unbelief. We see all they see it as just a normal day, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you get up, go to work, you see sin, you see God, all the things that God spoke about, Sodom and Gomorrah, all that stuff being poured out. You see it all being fulfilled. Amen. And they wake up. It's just another normal day because their eyesight is not the same. Because we have come under a different prophetic eyesight. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. What did he say about the church of Leodysia? They're wretched. Blind. &gt;&gt; Blind. Amen. So blind they don't know what a man or a woman is anymore. so blind they don't know about how to how to operate in marriages and and giving in marriage and divorce and all that. Why? Because of the blindness of Leodysia, &gt;&gt; but there's an Isaf. &gt;&gt; Thank God I received the Isaf that I can see. Amen. What is going on around us, what is happening in this age, what is taking place, what spot we are on the map. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God has anointed somebody to see. But it's so far out of focus with the world. Noah's time was so out of focus with the world. Noah knew that if God said so, he's going to he was able to put rain up there, whether there's rain or not. Abraham knew that if God said he's going to have a baby, he can make his body come to life, but he considered not his own body. He considered not the deadness of Sarah's womb. Amen. And here he was. He did, you know, he didn't even think about it. It didn't even come to his mind. He had focused all the unbelief out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Get all the unbelief out. That's what the church should do. That's what each member of the church should do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just a blanket statement here. That's what the each member of the church should do. But focus out of you all doubt and look only to the word. It promised it. God said so. It's got to be that way. The Bible said against hope he believed in hope. He staggered not at the promises of God but was strong giving praise to God. Each day he got stronger because the miracle was going to be just greater. &gt;&gt; And notice about Abraham, he never stopped praising God. &gt;&gt; I love what brother Matt said about praise. Amen. I I've used that already this week. I put my hands on the back of that devil and made him bow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. That's exactly what Abraham would do when thoughts try to come into his mind. He would just refocus himself and get all doubt out, raise his hands, and start praising God anyhow. Amen. I don't know how God's going to do it. I just know he promised me he would. And that's the way you you parents ought to be about your children. I don't know how he's going to do it. I just know he gave me the promise. And they may be as dead as midnight, but there's a voice that's going to speak and the bones are going to come to life. &gt;&gt; So, I'm just going to praise him while he works. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to glorify him whether I see a result or I don't see a result. It has nothing to do with what I see. It has to do with what I believe. Sometimes we can't even believe from one night to another. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we can't believe from one revival to another. &gt;&gt; We have to go out and we get entangled again with all that unbelief. &gt;&gt; He said we ought to be ashamed of ourselves. said, "Before we came here to confess and get that blood of Jesus that cleanses us from all sin, we should focus oursel down to where we can see one true living God standing here who made the promise that heavens and earth will pass away, but his word cannot fail." &gt;&gt; Stay right there on that. Then you'll not be tossed around with every wind that comes through and carried about from place to place, from pillar to post. Focus. Focus. He said that's the thing that broke up fellowship in Eden is because Eve failed to keep focused of her of of her looking on God's word and begin to listen to the reasonings of the enemy. Amen. If she just stayed focused with what God said and if God said it, it settles that God said so. But she didn't want to do that. She changed her focus of her glasses and begin to see instead of being just one way, there became two ways. Hello. &gt;&gt; How many's ever got your eyeballs out of focus, &gt;&gt; man? You wake up, you get knocked in the head or something, get out of focus, and all of a sudden there ain't one speaker there. There's two speakers there. There's two brother Joe's there. What's going on? Your eyes are out of focus. Brother Brown talked about Bill. He gave him a camera one time and told him, "Look up on that mountain, take a picture of this object." And it was a sarro cactus. And he said, 'I didn't I I seen not just one stalk. I seen two, three stalks. And and that I knew there was only one. I put it back down and put it back up and there was three. He said, ' But what was it? It was just out of focus. Just had to be focused in. He said, "That's the way it is sometimes. We get out of focus on what's really important. We get out of focus. We try to put something of God way back somewhere else or something another." Maybe, you know, we just need to focus in. Let the Holy Spirit get our ideas away from ourselves and get our church theology out of us and let him come in and connect us. We'll not see three or four. You'll see one object. &gt;&gt; You'll see one God. &gt;&gt; Looking through the same camera, a man can see something, but you know, his own intelligence tells him there's one stalk there. What what's going on? He said that's the way the Holy Spirit does. If we just let it have its way, it'll take the word itself and bring it into focus to where we can see what we're looking at then. And then you'll find out if people are trying to show you something that's wrong. You'll let that Holy Spirit begin to move and the word itself begins to show the word in manifestation and it brings it all into focus and it'll hit the mark. &gt;&gt; If it hit the mark one time, it'll hit the mark again. He talks about a little rifle. It was a little I think maybe a 22 rifle or something he had bought and he was driving tax with it, but something happened to it and he couldn't get it to drive tax. And and he said, "I I like to shoot squirrels." He said, "But I like to shoot them in the eyeball." He was quite the marksman. And he said, "You know, some brothers don't mind. They can shoot them in the body. They can shoot them in the head. They can shoot them in the tail. It doesn't want it doesn't matter to them. They can hit them. All right. Mid, back, center, back, anywhere, but I just can't do that. I I wanted to to be and he said, "I get so nervous and tore up about it sometimes." And he said, "I was wondering why it was." And he said, "As I was thinking about this rifle," and he said, he tried to send it back. And they wrote him a letter and said, "Look, it's it's it's in in the requirements that that we, you know, I forget the word the word there, but it's in the requirements, and so there's nothing we can do about He said, "But I know it drove tax one time, so I know it'll do it again." He said, "But something has got out of whack somewhere." And he said, "I wonder why have I h am I so worried about this?" And he said, "A voice spoke to him and said, you were made thus for a purpose. You were made like this for a purpose to be focused in." Amen. To be zeroed in. I'm thankful to have a prophet like that. He didn't just spray out here and hope he got a 50% right or 60% right or or 10% right. It was 100% right. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was zeroed in by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He said, "I I I I'm just that way. If it's zeroed in once, it'll zero it again. Is the same rifle." And he said, "If obeying this word and taking the taking the rangefinder and bringing it to a place to see the same things that those apostles saw, now see what he's talking about. angel. He went from the rifle back to the word. And he said, "If I can just bring it to the same place that I can see the same things that the apostles saw, the same gospels that they preached. &gt;&gt; It's not another gospel, the same gospel. &gt;&gt; It'll produce the same results." &gt;&gt; Because if it did it for them, it'll strike the target again. That's why we can't be satisfied with just hidden off over here and hidden off over there. We got to be zeroed in. &gt;&gt; Zeroed into the target that God's got something he's doing in this hour. And listen, if I'm off just a little bit here by the time I get way down there, &gt;&gt; actually, I was just seeing today was 11 years 11 years ago today. I was under this slab. Well, before slab was here digging in the dirt. me and brother Jeremy Shriner was putting in the plumbing 11 years to day. But brother Wayne would come here and he'd help us with the dirt work and he he worked as a surveyor for a long time and he we was out here making marks and things and he said you know it's amazing. He said with surveying I learned something. He said if you you can start off and if you don't get it exactly right you can be just off a millimeter right here. He said but by the time you get miles down the road you're off feet and hundreds of feet sometimes. This is where we see people. They they don't look that bad off, but they're off. &gt;&gt; And if you watch their life long enough, they'll be off in a ditch somewhere. &gt;&gt; That's why we got to stay focused. We got to stay right with the word and right where the Holy Spirit wants to move, we want to let him move. How he wants to orchestrate, we want to let him orchestrate. No matter what the church says the people claims to be, he said, "I know it'll do it." There that is. There is there's what I want to look at the word and see that it's exactly in focus. see the same vision they saw because it'll if it did a job for them, it'll do the same job for me. &gt;&gt; If it healed the sick, if it raised the dead, if it cast out devils, it'll be the same for us tonight if we'll stay with that same focus. &gt;&gt; It'll bring forth a glorious church. &gt;&gt; But it's depending on what you're looking at and what you're shooting after and what mark you're on. There's a lot of people that are not even following the message and even today are even atheist don't even believe in Jesus. But it didn't start out like that. Started with one little tiny shift. Now they've got their arms wrapped around their lesbian daughters and they so proud of themselves smoking a cigarette, drinking a beer. Come on. You'd have asked them 20 years ago or told them 20 years that's the way it was going to end up. They would have denied it. Said, "You're crazy." But they got off just a little bit. He said, "If he ever was God, he's still God. He always was God. He can't be nothing else but God because God is eternal." Therefore, we want to look to that target. Not what target the church is sitting at church is shooting at or what target, but what target Christ is shooting at. We look for Christ to appear. The same Jesus. He said when he was on earth a little while the world seeth me no more. Yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you to the end of the world. The same one who would direct the word be the word and direct it straight onto the target is the same Lord Jesus here this morning in the form of the Holy Spirit to direct our thoughts and focus his word to one true and living God and one purpose and one achievement. If we'll just let him do it, he'll focus the word right to a place that it'll prove he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; We must focus our lives. &gt;&gt; People get so focused in what they're going to do for a living or so focused in their their worldly possessions and so focused on all it's the wrong focus. &gt;&gt; Sure, I know we got to plant our potatoes and all that. understand all that, but don't let that become your focus. &gt;&gt; We must, you know, one of my one of my go-to quotes is, no matter what you do or how successful you become without Christ, you've totally lost everything. &gt;&gt; If you get down there and you miss him, you've missed everything. &gt;&gt; So, that's why we got to stay focused. We must focus our lives not what somebody else says or how somebody else says we ought to do it but focus our lives to him. He is the word and we get our lives lined up with the word then the word and our life becomes the same. He said if you abide in me and my word abide in you then ask what you will and it'll be granted. Verily I say unto you say this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass. You can have what you said, not what I said, what you said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can have because you and he become the same because the mind that was in Christ is now in you. And the mind that was in Christ was to fulfill the father's word. &gt;&gt; Not to buy, you know, more houses and more lands and get better. That that ain't that ain't our focus. I'm &gt;&gt; not saying God can't bless you. I'm not saying God can't do some things. He does it. That's not our focus. Our focus is leaving here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our focus is not even the next five minutes. Our focus is leaving here. &gt;&gt; I've seen people at a gate, excuse me, people at a gate waiting on an airplane. They ain't focused on nothing. They got something in their ears and about getting left, not listening for the call. &gt;&gt; Group so and so bored. Group so and so bored. There's those that are listening and when it group one bored, man, there they go. But there's others that just sit over there laxadasical and looking around reading something or listening on there something on the iPods or IP ear pods. whatever they got going on and they like they ain't got a care in the world. Listen, if they sat there long enough, they'd miss it. All of a sudden, they start scurrying, throwing their stuff in the in the bag and running down the aisle. What What is it? They lost their focus. What was really important? &gt;&gt; Amen. This is where people are getting because they got all kind of things in their ears and all kinds of things going on in their mind and all kind of thing. And meanwhile, God just moving along, fulfilling prophecy after prophecy after prophecy after prophecy. And if you got your eyes on the right thing, you'd see it being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; He said, "You know where you stand when you've been zeroed in with God. You see your own life hitting the target just like the apostles hit the target. You'll live the way they did. You you were baptized the way they were. You'll see the same results they see. You'll see it operating in you because you're zeroed in. You don't care what the company says, what denomination says, what anybody else said. You're zeroed in because you want to hit the target. Then you know where you're standing. It depends on what you're looking at. If you're looking to somebody else, you'll go anyway. And little any little puff of wind will blow you off target. If you can be blown off target, that means you're not being zeroed in. You're not focused. But if you are, there's nothing going to stop it. &gt;&gt; If your eyes single and you're looking at this at this at this target, Amen. I don't care how much wind blows. I don't care how much anxiety come. I don't care how much fear tries to put itself in front of you. It will not be stopped. Remember remember the story about the boy that won the bicycle thing &gt;&gt; because his eyes was on the right target. &gt;&gt; It was on the finish line. All these other boys were better riders than he was. They could do tricks on their bike. They could sit on the handlebars and ride backwards. They ride with no hands. He didn't have the fanciest of bikes. But here he comes up and he gets on this little plank and rides it to the finish line. They're like, "How did you do this? How how could you make it when we are much better writers than you and we are much better equipped than you and we are more called than you and we are why how he said because I didn't look down around me. &gt;&gt; I didn't see how high I was off the ground and get all worried about it. I didn't see how narrow the road was. &gt;&gt; I didn't see all of that. I kept my eyes on the finish line. Come on, church of the living God. That's exactly what you have to do. You can't look to see all the things that are around you and all the problems and the situation and the things that's going on here and the things that's on this side over here. You don't look to the left. You don't look to the right. You look to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He started the work. He will finish the work. You may have not have seen the fulfillment of what you asked for in a prayer line, but don't look to the left or look to the right. You look at what God promised. He promised me my healing. He promised me my child. He promised me every all these saying whatever you he I ask and I'm going to receive it. &gt;&gt; It depends on what you're looking at and how you're looking at things. Some people have negative outlooks. Some people have positive outlooks on life in general. Brother Brown would talk about Moses and Pharaoh and how they looked at things. And he said they would look out the same window and they saw those people out there differently. He said one saw nothing but a bunch of mudbers and slaves and despicables and all. That's all he could see. And he said, "Another one looked out and saw the chosen of God." &gt;&gt; Ah, what was they looking with? &gt;&gt; They were looking at apparently two different sets of eyes. Not just physically because they saw the same people. They saw the same people in the same mud, building the making the same bricks, building the same city. There wasn't it wasn't a change in in scenery at all. It was the same scene. But Pharaoh, when he looked, all he saw was slaves. All he saw was misfits. All he saw was people that he he had made can make profit off of. All he saw, wait a minute, was all this. But when Moses looked out, he saw those same people, but he saw with different eyes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. Amen. I ought to give us a good lesson on how we look at people at church. &gt;&gt; We look with the wrong eyeballs. We can see a lot of hypocrites. We can see a lot of this. We can see a lot of that. Just like Balams, he saw all kind of things going on at the hinder parts of Israel. Amen. But what he failed to see was the pillar of fire. What he failed to see was a shout of the king in the camp. &gt;&gt; What he failed to see was Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And if you look with the wrong eyes, you can see problems. You can see situations that you don't know what to do with. You can see things you don't like. But if you can look through the eyes of Christ, &gt;&gt; you would look with the same grace he looks with. &gt;&gt; You would look with the same love he looks with. Moses and Pharaoh looking out the same window at the same scene, but different eyes. Well, you look, somebody said, "Well, this can't happen. That can't happen." No, you look at what you know did happen. &gt;&gt; I know God met me there. Doesn't matter what anybody says or anybody thinks. I know God was there and I know he answered me. He heard me. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Focus out all the creeds and things that's got you mixed up. Focus on the word of God and then confess your unbelief and let God take his Holy Spirit and direct your sights right back to Jesus. We're looking to him then, not what anybody else says, not even what a doctor says. It might be good, but we ain't even looking at what a doctor said. He got his place. Amen. But we're looking at what Jesus said. We're looking at what he done. See, faith is designed to do this. See, faith today sees the same thing. faith in the of the church today would see the same program of God as it did 2,000 years ago. He said the church today that's called of God will certainly see the program of God because the program of God is written out here the blueprint and the Holy Spirit by faith is the one who reads it and sets it together. So if you're coming up with a different idea of the blueprint, you're looking through the wrong eyeballs. &gt;&gt; You might be looking through intellectual eyes. You might be looking through intellectual abilities, but if you'll look through the eyes of Christ, &gt;&gt; you'll see that this word has the same results as it had 2,000 years ago. It'll heal the sick. It'll raise the dead. It'll defeat Satan anytime, any place, anywhere, and any condition. He said, "How can a man say he's filled with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit say a certain way to do something in the Bible and this man comes around?" Well, that just that's just fanaticism. That don't mean nothing. Same kind of spirit that'll look at what a prophet says. Well, I don't agree with him. Who Who left you in charge? &gt;&gt; I just soon go with a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; I done seen where that spirit takes people. But Moses looked by faith. Pharaoh looked with his eyes what he could see. We could see. We could see when they when they had when when they come and they had sin in the camp and Moses made a brass serpent. It was a symbol. It was a symbol of something to come. It was showing that sin had been judged. And he stuck up this brass serpent and said, "Look and live." And if they looked, they were healed. &gt;&gt; But they they refused. Say, "What in the world, Moses? A serpent? Are you kidding me? What in the world? Couldn't you come up with a better plan than this?" Listen, God's plans don't always add up to human thinking. Matter of fact, it's so far and beyond. But what was it doing? It was speaking of a lamb that was going to be lifted up between heaven and earth and be judged. Amen. Sinned, judged in his body. divine judgment be brought forth. And if they would look at it, then they could live. Amen. And he said, "That's exactly the same way it is today. If you'll not look at your problems and your situations and all the things that are around you and you'll look to the one who took your judgment, &gt;&gt; who took your sin, who took your pain, who took your sickness, and you'll look to him, then you can live." &gt;&gt; No wonder the devil wants us to keep looking at our circumstances. Because if we keep looking at our circumstances, the how the longer we look at our circumstances, the quicker we're going to die. &gt;&gt; But if we'll turn our eyes to the things around us and the situations around us and we'll look to Jesus Christ and look and live. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what he said. He said, "If you're full of anxiety, look and live. If you're full of fear, look and live." That's right. &gt;&gt; If you have sickness in your body, look to Jesus and live. &gt;&gt; We We want We want big things to happen. Boom. Our enemies are dead around us. Woo! Glory to God. That ain't always the way it works out. &gt;&gt; Sometimes he leads you right in the middle of your enemies. They're breathing their breath and they got their swords drawn and they're screaming out cursings and all kinds of stuff at and he leads you right down. Long as he's leading, that's all that matters. &gt;&gt; Amen. Elijah when he came and prayed for rain. &gt;&gt; He tells the servant, "Go look." And he comes back and there ain't nothing. Go look ain't nothing. He comes back the seventh time and he said, "Well, I see a cloud the size of a man's hand. It wasn't no Louisiana thunder boomer come blowing through. Oh, it's going to rain. Glory to God. We can shout it's going to rain. It was the size of a man's hand. Seems so insignificant. But Elijah looked at that size of a man's hand and said, "As I see and I hear the abundance of rain, Not just a little drip drop, but the abundance of rain. Not just a little bit of here and a little bitty there, but abundance of rain. &gt;&gt; You may not see nothing tonight, but just the size of a cloud, the size of a man's hand. But if you'll look at it not with these eyes, and you'll look through the eyes of faith, &gt;&gt; I see the abundance of healing. I see the abundance of joy. I see the abundance of salvation. I see the abundance of prodals coming home. I see the abundance of deliverance. &gt;&gt; What are you looking at, brother Timothy? You see a big old cl hurricane out there. No, I see the cloud the size of a man's hand. &gt;&gt; But little is much when God is in it. &gt;&gt; Been faith. We have to have faith to look at things not as how the world looks at it, but at how God looks at it. Amen. Elijah kept looking until he seen just the size of a man's hand. He said, "Now unbelief would have caught that right quick and said, God, if that's the best you can do, if that's all you got, take it back." Well, I didn't get that. I didn't get nothing. I thought I did, but I didn't get nothing. I thought I saw a victory, but I guess I didn't. I I thought I saw I thought I got I thought I got the Holy Ghost, but I guess I didn't get it. That's the best you got. That's all you can do. Take it back. But he wasn't looking at that. He was looking at the supernatural. &gt;&gt; He knew what the hand of God could do. &gt;&gt; And when he saw the hand, J E S U S F A I T Hs. And when he saw it, he said, "I hear the sound of abundance of rain." What was it? He was accepting the He accepted the first move. &gt;&gt; Hello. He accepted the first move. &gt;&gt; Not the last move, not the finality. &gt;&gt; You know, when you watch fireworks, how many How many ever been to a fireworks show? You know when all the clapping takes place and when all the grand finale goes off, right? Boom. &gt;&gt; Well, what he's telling us, we ought to have the same enthusiasm when the first little &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; What are you seeing, brother Timothy? I just saw the first move. &gt;&gt; What was the first move? Somebody believed God. &gt;&gt; Somebody believed that he could provide rain in a desert and it been in a famine and been in a in a drought. God was going to move and break that drought. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe you felt that way. Maybe you felt for a couple years you've been in a drought. But let me tell you, this weekend and tonight, there's a poof. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, one little rock goes rolling off the mountain. One little grain of sand goes rolling growing off the mountain. One little movement takes place. We ought to be shouting and praising God. Whether it's one grain of sand or drum dump truckloads of grap sand, it don't matter. God's moving anyhow. God's changing this situation. God's making a way where there seems to be no way. That's what I'm looking at. He made the first move. He accepted the first move. Maybe there somebody just scrupled up, you know, in all kind of things, situations of life. Maybe you feel like you've been in a belly of a whale. Jonah was there one day, but he refused to look at the whale vomit around him and the stomach or the fish. We we tend to call it a whale, but the Bible says a fish, whatever kind of fish it was, it was a special kind of fish. I never forget that guy that said, he said, "I'm the kind of guy, I don't care if the Bible said it was a bluegill." I said, "One big old blue gill." But whatever it was, he was in it down in the bottom of the ocean. But he said, "I'm not going to look at all these symptoms around me. I'm not going to look at the circumstances as well. Vomit. It's time you start looking at what the devil's doing is just vomit. &gt;&gt; Just vomit. &gt;&gt; It's all it is. &gt;&gt; Filth. &gt;&gt; Trying to surround your life in trying to tear you down. Quit looking at it. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know how in the world he figured this out, but baby, I guess it was just by faith because he was in a dark place. No doubt. There was no pull string light bulb down there. I don't believe wasn't no compass. He say, "Okay, I'm pointing north, pointing south." No, it was by faith. He heard the word of God and he said, "When my people are in need and they call on my name, they turn toward my holy temple and they call on my name, they will hear from heaven." He says, "So I'm going to look away from all of these symptoms, all this well vomit, and all this situation around me, and I'm going to look to the hills which cometh my from my my help. For my help cometh from the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. And by faith, he turned in that old dark place. The devil had made it so dark, he couldn't even see his hand in front of his face. But he refused to look at all of that. And he looked towards the temple of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe if people can look towards a natural temple built by a natural man, how much more how much more faith could you have tonight? Not to look at something Solomon built or something anybody on on earth built, but a kingdom that is made not by hands of man, but the kingdom of God. And we could turn our eyes &gt;&gt; from all the things around us and look to the hills which cometh our help. &gt;&gt; Cuz our help comes from God. We say, "God, I'm going to praise you in this storm. &gt;&gt; I'm going to praise you no matter what. I'm going to magnify you no matter what goes on in my life cuz I know you're in control of every situation." He said, "You know, the devil sometimes put people off to revivals." Well, if I get to that revival, then things can be better. He said, "Might be fair. That might be good. But you don't have to wait till a revival." &gt;&gt; The best part of a revival is revival's right now. God wants to start it in you. God wants to start it in the church. The Holy Spirit will take the message and bring forth a message. God will vindicate it with great signs and wonders. Refuse to see anything that will make you doubt. &gt;&gt; Refuse to see anything that'll make you doubt. Job, he had a lot to look at. Boils on his body, wife turning away from him. friend sitting around him accusing him of being a secret sinner. But all of a sudden, somebody come say, "Hey, Joe, stand up. G yourself. Let me talk to you like a man." So, let me show you something. Let me get your eyes off your balls. Let me get your eyes off your circumstances around you. Let me get your eyes off your children that died in that accident and this thing that happened over. Let me get your eyes off of it. Let me get your eyes on something that's eternal. And all of a sudden, the darkness broke in Job. And he looked and he said, "I know my redeemer lives. &gt;&gt; Though the skin worms destroy my body, yet in my flesh I shall see God." &gt;&gt; What was it? He got away from what was temporary. &gt;&gt; Because the situation he was in was temporary. It ended. &gt;&gt; God restored. Amen. Back twofold. God's trying to get us to look at something greater than what we can see with these eyes. &gt;&gt; God wants us to look at his word and his word only. Hallelujah. Let's stand together. He said, "Look at the church today. It's in chaos. All mixed up. The world just in chaos around us. It's looking what's happening? Do we got this? Do we got that? What's going on?" But he said, "There's another person. There's another people, the bride. And they're looking also. They're looking for the coming of the Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; with that secret secret coming of Christ when he shall come and catch away his bride in the night. [Music] Let's bow our hearts for a moment to just say, "Lord, let me stay focused. Lord, let let not let not my eyes get on things around me in situations, but let my eyes stay on you, Jesus. Father, you see hands lifted all over this building. Oh God, so easy sometimes to get sidetracked, thoughts on other things, situations around us. [Music] God, no doubt even this week, Satan's come and tempted many to look and say, "Well, did you get anything? Did you really get what you said you got, trying to knock them off their focus and thereby knock them off the promises of God." But Lord, tonight as we've heard the word, may our eyes look straight before us to the finish line. It will be worth it all. Oh, God bless each hand that was lifted. Father, have my hand too. Lord, so easy to get our eyes on things around us, circumstances of life, sicknesses and things. God, forgive us for our unbelief and our doubts. God, fill us with faith. To believe, Lord, today, to believe for impossible things to become possible. Lord, to believe, Father, in spite of what the world's doing, what's around us, in spite of the what Satan's doing, hot breath blowing upon us, in spite of it all. And Lord, while we believe, may we yet praise you and thank you for all that you've done in our lives. Oh Jesus, we love you. Father, bless us tonight in your presence. I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Lord, I praise the Lord. I will praise the Lord. Oh, no matter what tomorrow brings, what it has in store, I will praise the Lord. [Music] Yes, I I will praise the Lord. I will praise the Lord no matter what tomorrow brings, what it has in store. I will praise the Lord. [Music] Yes, I will praise the Lord. I will praise the Lord. [Music] No matter what tomorrow brings, what it has in store, I will praise the Lord. [Music] and pains of death seized on my soul. Oh to the Lord I cried. Till Jesus came and he made me whole. I would not be would not be denied. [Music] I would not be denied till Jesus came and he made me whole. I would not be denied. Oh shake of in the day of old. I wrestle with the Lord and instead with a courageous I stood stood upon his word. You said I would not be denied. No, I would not be denied. Till Jesus came and he made me whole. I would not be denied. Hello Satan said my Lord was gone and he would not hear my prayer. But praise the Lord the work is done in Christ the Lord is here. Oh, I would not be I would not be denied. I would not be denied till Jesus came and he made me whole. I would not be denied. No, I would not. I would not be denied. I would not be denied till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be denied. Oh, I will not compreise. No, will not compreise. [Music] Till Jesus comes and he makes me whole. I will not compromise. [Music] No, I will not be denied. Oh Lord, I will not be denied. Till Jesus came and he made me behold I would not be denied. Give the Lord a good hand clap of praise tonight. Amen. Praise the Lord. Keep that laser focus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep our eyes on the prize. There's something to gain. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can lose this whole world, but give me Jesus. Amen. We love you tonight in the name of the Lord. We won't hold you. Let you be dismissed as you feel to go. Maybe we can play. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord, as we go. Open the eyes of my heart. Same key flat. Amen. We love you tonight. God bless you. Pray for the ministry, for the services this weekend. Remember those that are gone away for a couple of days. I think there's some camping trips that are going on. And so just remember them in prayer and we'll pray for them and I'm sure they'll be praying for us as well. God bless you tonight. We'll just sing this as you go. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open the eyes of my heart. I want to see. I want to see you. [Music] Just open the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open the eyes of my heart. I want to see you, Lord. I want to see you, to see you, to see you. High and lifted up. Oh, shining in the light of your glory. Pour out your power and love as we sing. Holy, holy, holy, [Music] holy, holy, holy. I want to see you. I want to see you. Do I
