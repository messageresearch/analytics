[1:04:09] if you have your bibles we would like to
[1:04:11] go to the scripture in the book of joel
[1:04:13] the second chapter in the 28th verse
[1:04:16] joel chapter 2
[1:04:18] and verse 28
[1:04:20] amen
[1:04:21] joel 2 and 28.
[1:04:30] very tremendous
[1:04:32] old testament prophecy
[1:04:34] of the day that we live
[1:04:36] and it shall come to pass afterward that
[1:04:38] i will pour out my spirit
[1:04:41] upon
[1:04:42] all flesh and
[1:04:43] your sons and daughters shall prophesy
[1:04:47] and their old men shall dream dreams
[1:04:49] and your young men shall see visions
[1:04:53] brother branham uses this scripture a
[1:04:55] lot in the message
[1:04:58] in the book of romans the 8th chapter
[1:05:01] in the 11th verse
[1:05:03] paul
[1:05:04] in the new testament
[1:05:08] speaking of this same
[1:05:10] happening
[1:05:11] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:05:13] jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:05:16] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:05:17] shall also quicken
[1:05:19] your mortal
[1:05:20] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:05:24] you
[1:05:25] by his spirit
[1:05:27] that dwelleth in you
[1:05:29] may god bless you this morning as you be
[1:05:30] seated
[1:05:33] i'd like to just speak to you a little
[1:05:35] bit today uh up on this topic and i'd
[1:05:38] like to take this title
[1:05:40] i think it's the ev first time i've ever
[1:05:42] took a title here
[1:05:43] uh but this is the dynamics
[1:05:46] are here
[1:05:48] the dynamics
[1:05:50] are here
[1:05:52] i think it's a very
[1:05:53] a very awakening time for the church of
[1:05:55] the living god
[1:05:58] i believe it's an hour such as
[1:06:00] such as no man's ever been able to live
[1:06:02] or
[1:06:03] to be able to be in so i pray god give
[1:06:06] us the ability
[1:06:07] to get a hold of the time that we live
[1:06:09] and to
[1:06:10] see what kind of age that we're in and
[1:06:13] allow us to recognize where we're
[1:06:15] standing and the rise of the sun in 1965
[1:06:19] paragraph 107 the first chief come up
[1:06:21] from all the prophets which was the son
[1:06:22] of god
[1:06:24] the king of all the prophets
[1:06:26] and there has been churches and churches
[1:06:28] and brides and brides and churches and
[1:06:30] brides
[1:06:31] but there's got to come one
[1:06:34] there has got to come a real bride
[1:06:37] there must come one that's not only got
[1:06:39] the mechanics
[1:06:41] but the dynamics of it
[1:06:43] now look what he said he said there's
[1:06:44] got to come a real bride
[1:06:47] and that real bride's going to have both
[1:06:49] the mechanics and the dynamics of it
[1:06:51] that makes the church live it moves in
[1:06:54] the power
[1:06:55] of his resurrection
[1:06:57] until we come to the place that we find
[1:06:59] that
[1:07:00] what good does it do to polish the hood
[1:07:03] what good does it do to give a face like
[1:07:05] a lift or seminize the job when there's
[1:07:08] no dynamics in it no matter how much the
[1:07:11] mechanics prove to be right
[1:07:14] there has got to be a dynamics that will
[1:07:16] make it work
[1:07:18] no matter how much we can stand and
[1:07:20] prove that it's right there has to be
[1:07:22] something that makes it go to work
[1:07:25] something's got to make it work in our
[1:07:27] lives now in paragraph 110 brother
[1:07:29] branham will say this that's what he
[1:07:31] proved hallelujah
[1:07:32] that's what easter proved that he wasn't
[1:07:35] only the word
[1:07:37] but he was god himself
[1:07:40] i the preacher in me wants to stop and
[1:07:42] preach an hour on the god head right
[1:07:43] there amen to all these people that
[1:07:46] separated our lord in half a dozen
[1:07:48] places i think they could read these
[1:07:49] things that help them
[1:07:50] he said that but he was god himself
[1:07:54] the dynamics in the word
[1:07:56] he wasn't only the word but he was god
[1:07:58] himself the dynamics in the word and
[1:08:01] that made the body of our jesus christ
[1:08:03] cold stiff and dead and in the grave
[1:08:07] shake into the life and rise again roll
[1:08:10] away the stone he said i am he that was
[1:08:12] dead so dead to the sun
[1:08:15] he he was so dead till the sun was dead
[1:08:18] the moon he was excuse me he was rolling
[1:08:21] with the stone i am he that was dead so
[1:08:23] dead to the sun
[1:08:24] amen he was so dead to the moon said he
[1:08:26] was dead the stars said he was dead
[1:08:29] nature said he was dead the whole world
[1:08:32] has to recognize now that he's alive
[1:08:34] again
[1:08:36] he was not only the mechanics he was
[1:08:38] god's word he was the dynamics to prove
[1:08:40] it
[1:08:42] and he being the groom the bride has to
[1:08:45] come forth because it's part of him and
[1:08:47] it can only be the manifestation of the
[1:08:50] fulfilling of all the revelations that
[1:08:52] any other has spoke of the bride see it
[1:08:55] can only manifest if it does something
[1:08:58] different from the groom it isn't the
[1:09:01] bride
[1:09:02] because she is flesh
[1:09:04] of his flesh she is born of his bone she
[1:09:08] has a life of his life she has power of
[1:09:10] his power oh brother adam says it
[1:09:13] wonderfully she is him
[1:09:17] and a man or a woman and a woman taken
[1:09:19] from his side she had been taken a
[1:09:22] spirit the feminist spirit from him the
[1:09:24] flesh from his side both made mechanics
[1:09:27] and dynamics the wife the spirit of him
[1:09:30] and the flesh of him and put it together
[1:09:33] and made mechanics and dynamics
[1:09:36] a man made mechanics and dynamics that's
[1:09:39] who the bride is she is the flesh of him
[1:09:42] but she's also the spirit of him
[1:09:44] where did eve get the particles for her
[1:09:47] body from adam
[1:09:49] where did eve get her spirit it was from
[1:09:52] adam
[1:09:53] she was both his flesh and his blood and
[1:09:56] his spirit and so is the church of the
[1:09:58] living god she's not only the word but
[1:10:01] she is the spirit that was taken from
[1:10:03] jesus christ that makes that word live
[1:10:07] within our lives see to say that you're
[1:10:09] the bride means you're saying you are
[1:10:11] both mechanics and dynamics unless
[1:10:14] you're that you cannot be the bride amen
[1:10:17] but if you're that then the spirit of it
[1:10:19] is going to prove amen who you are the
[1:10:21] dynamics of it it's his mechanics do you
[1:10:24] see now brother adam will say it like
[1:10:25] this again amen now after the all these
[1:10:28] easter bunnies and ceremonies and
[1:10:30] churches and finally he said they'll
[1:10:32] pass away but the church becomes both
[1:10:35] dynamics and mechanics
[1:10:38] and the spirit of god that moved him to
[1:10:41] do the things he did
[1:10:43] if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the
[1:10:46] bride
[1:10:47] for he had said in john 14 that he that
[1:10:50] believeth on me the works that i do
[1:10:52] shall he do also and i give him a charge
[1:10:56] amen i'll give him a charge of my
[1:10:58] dynamics in his mechanics and the world
[1:11:02] will not be able to withstand it
[1:11:04] and amen look at that amen god is going
[1:11:07] to put something in his word amen that
[1:11:10] the devil the world the the economy will
[1:11:13] not be able to withstand it'll be a
[1:11:15] charge see it'll be a charge in the
[1:11:17] dynamics amen the world would not be
[1:11:19] able to do it i'll raise him up again in
[1:11:21] the last day now brother adam you've
[1:11:23] heard him teach on my thanksgiving
[1:11:26] message and you remember they're
[1:11:27] invisible you did right here at
[1:11:29] shreveport he preaches it and he comes
[1:11:31] down he's preached pretty much the whole
[1:11:32] sermon
[1:11:33] and then he stops and he says now but my
[1:11:35] my message to you is
[1:11:38] that you've never done it in the first
[1:11:39] place
[1:11:40] he said now that's the thanksgiving
[1:11:42] message to you well in the eastern
[1:11:44] message and rising of the sun he's
[1:11:46] preached a long ways into it and then he
[1:11:48] stops and just like in that message he
[1:11:50] says in the easter message and he said
[1:11:53] that's my easter's message that the
[1:11:55] dynamics and the mechanics are together
[1:11:58] now this is the message of the last day
[1:12:01] this is the easter message to the church
[1:12:04] amen the mechanics and the dynamics are
[1:12:07] together
[1:12:08] if you're still looking for the dynamics
[1:12:10] you have missed the message
[1:12:13] if you're still looking for the dynamics
[1:12:15] of god to come you have missed the
[1:12:18] message of the hour the mechanics amen
[1:12:21] have now become the dynamics by the
[1:12:24] spirit that is moving in them amen now
[1:12:27] listen he said the mechanics without the
[1:12:29] dynamics is no good and neither is the
[1:12:31] dynamics without the mechanics
[1:12:34] it'll take both amen the word and the
[1:12:37] spirit it'll take both of them amen you
[1:12:40] can scream and shout and jump up all
[1:12:42] down all you want to and deny this word
[1:12:44] and it won't do you any good you're just
[1:12:47] cranking around on the pistons there's
[1:12:49] no spark to fire no gasoline to fire it
[1:12:51] by it'll only work as it comes together
[1:12:55] it will only do that see and the other
[1:12:57] one will go up that's the only thing
[1:12:58] there is to it they most both look alike
[1:13:01] they both claim to be churches they both
[1:13:03] claim to be bribed but one has got
[1:13:05] mechanics and dynamics and it brings it
[1:13:08] to pass of what is said is true see it
[1:13:10] won't just move see no matter how good
[1:13:13] the mechanics is until the dynamics
[1:13:15] comes when the dynamics comes he says
[1:13:18] that's the fire that is made to connect
[1:13:20] with the gasoline when he explodes and
[1:13:22] causes combustion and moves every motion
[1:13:25] and every move he is the same yesterday
[1:13:27] today and forever that's the
[1:13:29] resurrection that's the real power of
[1:13:31] god that's the mechanics with the
[1:13:33] dynamics it's the spirit that quickens
[1:13:36] it's the spark that fires you see
[1:13:39] there's got to come something on the
[1:13:40] word that'll make it live amen i know
[1:13:43] it's sitting here today watching this
[1:13:45] congregation throughout these meetings i
[1:13:47] think it's a powerful thing to see of
[1:13:49] course you see great moves in the in the
[1:13:52] pentecostal world you see a great
[1:13:54] emotional carrying on and things like
[1:13:56] that but pick up the scripture one time
[1:13:58] and it'll become a very quiet place
[1:14:00] amen pick up a little bit of doctrine on
[1:14:02] predestination or the truth spirit or
[1:14:04] the true baptism and everything will
[1:14:06] quieten way down amen but that's not the
[1:14:09] case with the bride of jesus christ
[1:14:11] they're just as carried away with the
[1:14:12] word of god as they are a good song
[1:14:15] because their revival is not coming from
[1:14:18] the music the revival is not coming amen
[1:14:21] from the church building the revival is
[1:14:23] not coming from the atmosphere the
[1:14:25] revival is coming from the word and the
[1:14:28] word is creating music and the word is
[1:14:31] creating revival and the word is
[1:14:33] creating churches and the word is
[1:14:35] creating buildings amen we're not just
[1:14:38] another church amen but this is the
[1:14:41] bride that is connected both the
[1:14:43] mechanics and the dynamics together in
[1:14:46] the last days amen in the rise of the
[1:14:48] sons a powerful sermon brother adam says
[1:14:51] that all of a sudden the dynamics will
[1:14:52] come and what did it do it not only
[1:14:55] filled their spirit inside but it
[1:14:57] quickened the mechanics their bodies
[1:14:59] were quickened they were no more cowards
[1:15:02] they went right up into the face of
[1:15:03] people and said you men of judea and you
[1:15:06] that dwell in jerusalem before the
[1:15:08] dynamics comes see they were just
[1:15:10] mechanics see now watch what they do you
[1:15:12] men that dwell in jerusalem let this be
[1:15:14] known and hearken to my words these are
[1:15:17] not drunk as you suppose
[1:15:19] i'm one of them this is that i'll show
[1:15:22] you what it is it's the scripture this
[1:15:26] is that and i've always said if this
[1:15:28] ain't that let me keep this till that
[1:15:31] comes
[1:15:32] amen no this is that which was spoken by
[1:15:35] the prophet joel it shall come to pass
[1:15:37] in the last days saith the lord i'll
[1:15:39] pour out my spirit upon all flesh now
[1:15:42] watch brother branham's interpretation
[1:15:44] of that scripture i'll pour out my
[1:15:46] spirit upon all flesh the dynamics will
[1:15:49] come into the mechanics amen then then
[1:15:52] they wasn't afraid anymore amen people
[1:15:55] all the time you hear people preaching
[1:15:57] joel chapter two amen and the spirit we
[1:15:59] poured out and they keep saying and when
[1:16:01] the dynamics comes and when the dynamics
[1:16:04] comes and when the dynamics comes but
[1:16:07] according to william branham when joel
[1:16:09] chapter 2 said i'll pour out my spirit
[1:16:11] he said that's the dynamics that's
[1:16:13] coming into the mechanics amen and i
[1:16:15] don't know about you i'm not here today
[1:16:18] waiting for the dynamics to come i am
[1:16:20] here to enjoy the benefits of the
[1:16:23] dynamics of god that is coming to the
[1:16:25] church of the living god in the last
[1:16:27] days we are not here just passing time
[1:16:30] we're not here just amen just getting
[1:16:32] together we have come together to
[1:16:35] worship in the spirit of god amen until
[1:16:38] every situation of our lives are changed
[1:16:40] until everything drops away from us and
[1:16:43] we line up to the word of god thus saith
[1:16:46] the lord word by word line by line a
[1:16:50] word bride in the last days amen not
[1:16:53] just an emotional church a bride full of
[1:16:56] the word of god i know what i'm talking
[1:16:58] about you have a good meeting and
[1:17:00] there's a there's a thousand philistines
[1:17:02] out there to market to be just an
[1:17:05] emotional workup amen after we have a
[1:17:07] good meeting there'll be people all over
[1:17:09] the country criticizing well just a
[1:17:11] bunch of emotion just a bunch of this
[1:17:13] don't you let that devil water this down
[1:17:16] to an emotional time or just an
[1:17:18] emotional happening there is more going
[1:17:21] on in the house of god and just a
[1:17:24] building of emotion and working this is
[1:17:26] the preaching of the greatest revelation
[1:17:30] that has ever struck the face of the
[1:17:32] earth jesus christ the son of god i
[1:17:36] propose to you he is not dead this
[1:17:38] morning i propose to you he's not in
[1:17:41] jerusalem this morning he's right here
[1:17:44] in the house of god filled in the hearts
[1:17:47] of men and women of god don't you lift
[1:17:49] that devil water this down or put a bad
[1:17:52] reputation amen and make it seem like
[1:17:54] something is wrong with it well if there
[1:17:57] is something wrong
[1:17:58] with enjoying the spirit of god amen
[1:18:01] then let me be wrong but there's
[1:18:03] something in my heart that says it's
[1:18:06] right
[1:18:08] this is the way the first church acted
[1:18:10] this is the way the real church acted
[1:18:12] they got their hearts full of the holy
[1:18:15] ghost and they lost their fear of man
[1:18:17] and they lost their fear of people what
[1:18:20] they would have to say about it i think
[1:18:22] it's high time let the spirit of grace
[1:18:25] take the fear out of your heart to
[1:18:28] worship god without dictation of man
[1:18:31] without the ideas of man
[1:18:37] i know what i'm talking about you can
[1:18:39] get the devil cast out of you you can
[1:18:41] enjoy this weekend and before monday
[1:18:44] morning the devil will come along and
[1:18:46] tell you you just got in motion
[1:18:49] you just had an emotional worker that's
[1:18:51] a lying devil
[1:18:53] and all he's done to come and to steal
[1:18:55] and to kill and destroy you know what
[1:18:58] he's coming to do he's coming to take
[1:19:00] away that experience you prayed your
[1:19:03] whole life to have amen and if he can
[1:19:05] convince you that that's not a real
[1:19:07] experience it does no good to get it
[1:19:10] amen but if god ever gives a man an
[1:19:12] experience and he knows it comes from
[1:19:15] god it doesn't make any difference what
[1:19:18] the devil says or what a thousand
[1:19:21] philistines have to say i know in whom i
[1:19:24] believed i know the god that i serve is
[1:19:28] a real god
[1:19:34] oh yes son i read about shamgar in the
[1:19:37] bible
[1:19:39] i love the bible just a short verse but
[1:19:41] a prophet can bring a lot out of it
[1:19:43] he said a thousand six hundred
[1:19:45] philistines he said come to get amen
[1:19:48] meant shamgar's uh harvest didn't he you
[1:19:52] know what brother man said he said he'd
[1:19:53] come back to tell him it was just in
[1:19:54] motion
[1:19:57] that's what them philistines did come
[1:19:59] back just tell you to take the
[1:20:01] experience that god gave you now if you
[1:20:04] let him do it it don't matter how many
[1:20:06] services you're in it don't matter how
[1:20:08] many times god blesses you and feels you
[1:20:10] and gives you anointing until you're
[1:20:13] ready to receive what is happening to
[1:20:15] you until you're ready to accept it and
[1:20:18] confess it as such as god has given in
[1:20:20] this age i have no hesitation in telling
[1:20:23] you what i have received amen comes from
[1:20:27] joel the second chapter it comes from
[1:20:29] acts the second chapter it comes to
[1:20:31] romans the eighth chapter i am anointed
[1:20:34] of the lord to preach the gospel of
[1:20:37] jesus christ i didn't accept some
[1:20:40] emotional spirit i received the spirit
[1:20:43] of jesus christ that raises the dead he
[1:20:46] raised me out of a dead dark
[1:20:48] denominational world and filled me with
[1:20:51] a holy ghost
[1:20:54] and i ain't giving it back and i ain't
[1:20:56] let the devil take it away from me
[1:21:02] no sir i may not be educated but i got a
[1:21:05] weapon
[1:21:10] i got the weapon of the spirit the sword
[1:21:13] of the lord is the weapons of our
[1:21:15] warfare and they may not be carnal but
[1:21:18] they're very mighty
[1:21:22] preachers what are you saying i think
[1:21:23] it's time to pick something up and beat
[1:21:25] that devil off of you
[1:21:30] i said something on the beat here the
[1:21:31] day of northern arkansas i was preaching
[1:21:34] kind of come along this experience thing
[1:21:37] you can see demons just move throughout
[1:21:39] the earth
[1:21:42] i was talking this brother about
[1:21:43] experience i was preaching about it
[1:21:44] actually and i was preaching about this
[1:21:46] very point
[1:21:47] little sham guard
[1:21:49] took his oxnard
[1:21:50] run that devil off of experience and
[1:21:52] said it was emotion
[1:21:54] and when i said that there was a look
[1:21:55] coming this man's eye he's probably
[1:21:57] 60-year-old man sitting there been out
[1:21:59] of church for years just come back
[1:22:00] recently and he's sitting there and i
[1:22:02] seen a real strange expression come in
[1:22:04] his face and like a release of something
[1:22:07] big tears started crying he said most he
[1:22:09] don't hardly move it off he just said
[1:22:11] some watches and that's okay those are
[1:22:13] receiving something hey man he was
[1:22:15] sitting there and when and when that was
[1:22:16] finished after the service he met me out
[1:22:18] front he said bro wayne i got something
[1:22:21] tell you
[1:22:22] i said you do he said yeah he said years
[1:22:23] ago i was in a tent meeting up in hardy
[1:22:26] arkansas and said the spirit of god came
[1:22:28] and the atmosphere was powerful and god
[1:22:31] gave me something he gave me an
[1:22:33] experience i literally was in an
[1:22:35] experience with the holy ghost and power
[1:22:37] he said i come back to the church
[1:22:39] he said and somebody said to me oh then
[1:22:42] things happen to people all the time and
[1:22:43] they go off to the side they lose their
[1:22:46] mind and he said you know what i let
[1:22:48] somebody tell me that it was just a
[1:22:50] fanatical happening
[1:22:52] now i want y'all to hear me that
[1:22:54] happened in the 1970s
[1:22:56] and in the year 220 i'm preaching to
[1:22:59] this man
[1:23:00] it's years
[1:23:01] 50 years later
[1:23:04] and in the moment he realizes that
[1:23:06] really was an experience with god he
[1:23:09] went right back to it amen and he
[1:23:11] remembered being god's always kept his
[1:23:14] word he just didn't believe what god was
[1:23:17] doing for him and i don't know if you're
[1:23:19] recognizing really what is happening
[1:23:22] really what has taken place it's not
[1:23:24] just another good meeting it's the
[1:23:26] dynamics of the power of god that is
[1:23:29] prophesied in the scriptures in the last
[1:23:32] days i shall pour out my spirit saith
[1:23:35] the lord i shall restore
[1:23:41] some of you god's done wonderful things
[1:23:43] for you but you let an old devil take it
[1:23:45] away from you you let the devil tell you
[1:23:48] it wasn't real and it was emotional and
[1:23:51] it was this or it was that that was the
[1:23:53] devil lying but if you would reach back
[1:23:55] into your memory and get a hold of that
[1:23:58] experience it was real it really was
[1:24:01] real and it'll become a reality
[1:24:06] you know what i'm talking about
[1:24:14] god can do a miracle but you've got to
[1:24:16] be willing to accept it
[1:24:19] god can heal you but you got to be
[1:24:20] willing to accept it he can see him the
[1:24:23] greatest revival the world has ever saw
[1:24:26] but you've got to accept it
[1:24:31] oh yeah
[1:24:33] it's real
[1:24:34] it's a real dynamics it's a real power
[1:24:36] amen and his promise for this last day
[1:24:38] you said by the way if the dynamics is
[1:24:40] here
[1:24:41] amen if the dynamics is here tell me
[1:24:43] tell me about it well let me tell you
[1:24:45] what brother branham says
[1:24:46] he said mechanics don't run a church
[1:24:49] it's the dynamics
[1:24:52] the holy ghost gets into the word so
[1:24:54] it's not a seminary that teaches you
[1:24:56] theology and greek interpretations it's
[1:24:59] the dynamics of the holy ghost in there
[1:25:04] to set a fire
[1:25:06] and to bring it to pass
[1:25:08] now
[1:25:10] now i love the balance of the scripture
[1:25:11] and the quotes
[1:25:15] and some people will take that
[1:25:17] and they'll run off to the other side
[1:25:19] and say you don't need no word
[1:25:22] and if i was the devil that's what i'd
[1:25:24] say
[1:25:26] because he's going to get his weapon on
[1:25:27] that word
[1:25:28] [Applause]
[1:25:29] if god's in it
[1:25:32] but if god ain't in it the bible said
[1:25:34] the letter killeth
[1:25:36] but the spirit gives it life
[1:25:38] [Applause]
[1:25:39] so i appreciate the men of god that take
[1:25:41] time to go in the scripture and bring
[1:25:42] out the powerful points amen and to
[1:25:45] bring out the greek and show what it is
[1:25:46] amen as long as the spirit's in it it'll
[1:25:49] have a power and anointing upon the
[1:25:51] church it'll feed your soul
[1:25:55] now the dynamics of the holy ghost is in
[1:25:56] there to set a fire and to bring it to
[1:25:58] pass and to make it live just exactly
[1:26:01] what the promised word is for this hour
[1:26:04] not the mechanics the dynamics is it it
[1:26:07] takes mechanics and dynamics the word
[1:26:09] and the spirit are there the one that
[1:26:12] gives it life
[1:26:13] that's what gives it life
[1:26:15] now you said preacher where is that
[1:26:17] dynamics that then brother brown says it
[1:26:19] like this
[1:26:20] he says if the spirit that raised him
[1:26:22] from the day of the word he said the
[1:26:24] dynamic of the word dwells in you it
[1:26:27] will quicken your mortal body
[1:26:31] say my mortal body
[1:26:33] my mortal that one you fight with that
[1:26:35] troubled one
[1:26:36] that evil one that's on the outside
[1:26:39] don't see taste fill smell and hear
[1:26:41] those senses that you fight on a daily
[1:26:43] basis
[1:26:44] come on they won't be converted till you
[1:26:46] get a body change so it's a mortal body
[1:26:49] are you hearing me it's a mortal body
[1:26:51] it's a it's a it's a it's a complete war
[1:26:55] with that outside man but look what he
[1:26:57] says here amen if the spirit that raised
[1:26:59] up jesus from the god dwells in you
[1:27:01] it'll quicken that body now the flesh of
[1:27:03] his flesh and bone of his bone because
[1:27:05] quickly you were yet mortal sinners
[1:27:08] ready to die but it quickens that body
[1:27:11] what does it do it brings life the
[1:27:13] spirit that once drank can run around
[1:27:15] and commit adultery it's all quickened
[1:27:18] why the thing died and you are
[1:27:21] resurrected
[1:27:22] it quickens your mortal body
[1:27:25] this dynamic spirit moves you from a
[1:27:28] mortal to immortal creature right now
[1:27:31] immortality does not begin when you die
[1:27:34] immortality begins when the dynamics of
[1:27:37] god comes into your life
[1:27:39] come on church you're a millionaire
[1:27:41] trapped in an old rapid body you're a
[1:27:45] son of god
[1:27:46] trapped into a body of sin that gives
[1:27:49] you a war but on the inside of that body
[1:27:53] is a son of god that was coming from god
[1:27:56] before the worlds ever began
[1:28:01] for your body
[1:28:02] therefore your body is in my body
[1:28:05] that for your body this thing you're
[1:28:08] wary and this thing you're living in he
[1:28:10] said it's the temple of the dynamics
[1:28:15] where's god going to have church
[1:28:19] know you not that ye are the temples
[1:28:22] not not mortar and brick flesh and blood
[1:28:25] amen not amen not an immortal body a
[1:28:29] mortal body god's word is so powerful it
[1:28:33] doesn't matter where you put it it'll
[1:28:36] take over
[1:28:37] you can put it in a drunkard's life
[1:28:39] it'll take over you can put it in a
[1:28:41] smoker's life it'll take over because
[1:28:44] there's a seed on the inside that is the
[1:28:47] conqueror of the earth and once christ
[1:28:50] comes into the heart he'll take over
[1:28:53] step by step
[1:28:55] peace my speech
[1:28:57] you become the dynamics you become the
[1:28:59] temple
[1:29:00] of his dynamics
[1:29:03] i tell you that's worth the sermon by
[1:29:05] itself isn't it the temple of his
[1:29:07] dynamics
[1:29:09] that's where church really happens
[1:29:11] that's where things are really going on
[1:29:15] amen in that temple of dynamics because
[1:29:17] from the beginning you are a part of the
[1:29:19] mechanics
[1:29:21] oh
[1:29:22] listen to the prophet from the beginning
[1:29:24] you're a part of the mechanics what's he
[1:29:26] saying you were an attribute
[1:29:28] he's saying in the beginning you were
[1:29:29] the word
[1:29:31] you're a part of the father but it laid
[1:29:34] in you dormant amen and you see as long
[1:29:37] as that seed lays dormant there's no
[1:29:39] power in that life amen but when the
[1:29:41] dynamics comes upon it he moves you into
[1:29:44] a temple a dynamic power you become a
[1:29:48] powerhouse
[1:29:49] brother brown said i didn't come to
[1:29:50] build denominations i come to build
[1:29:53] powerhouses do you see what this message
[1:29:55] has come to do it's come to make a
[1:29:57] powerhouse out of you you're not here in
[1:29:59] laodicea to be under the elements of
[1:30:02] this life and this world god come to
[1:30:04] bring and make a powerhouse out of your
[1:30:07] life and overcomer of the life that
[1:30:09] you're living in
[1:30:11] it's the temple of the dynamics these
[1:30:13] bodies right now
[1:30:16] oh there's your resurrection it's the
[1:30:18] church and the resurrection within these
[1:30:20] bodies right now can you say right now
[1:30:23] are quickened
[1:30:25] they are quickened
[1:30:27] right now you've heard you believe it
[1:30:29] you're changed from denomination to the
[1:30:31] word
[1:30:32] already quickened amen you say well how
[1:30:35] can i identify the dynamics in my life
[1:30:38] brother brown said the dynamics of the
[1:30:40] church will be a refilling of the holy
[1:30:42] ghost
[1:30:45] it'll be a refilling
[1:30:47] of the holy ghost he said preacher what
[1:30:49] are you talking about i'm talking about
[1:30:51] acts the second chapter i'm talking
[1:30:53] about 120 million who was in the upper
[1:30:55] room who had mechanics in their life who
[1:30:58] was jean seeds of god before the world
[1:31:00] began but but peter was running and
[1:31:03] cussing
[1:31:05] he didn't have it he had a fear in his
[1:31:07] heart to tell him what had happened to
[1:31:09] his life but that morning they waited
[1:31:12] about 10 days and a spirit of
[1:31:14] unification come among them until they
[1:31:16] unified on the promise of god they took
[1:31:19] the promise amen that if you'll terry in
[1:31:22] jerusalem the promise of my father will
[1:31:24] come upon you which was isaiah the 28th
[1:31:26] chapter with stammering lips and other
[1:31:28] tongues well i send them to my people
[1:31:30] our refreshing shall come unto you and
[1:31:33] peter knew that was the scripture and
[1:31:36] james knew and john knew and jesus had
[1:31:38] identified what they were waiting on ten
[1:31:41] days they were waiting
[1:31:43] [Applause]
[1:31:43] [Music]
[1:31:44] unifying 10 days on one scripture i bet
[1:31:47] by then they got all the nonsense out of
[1:31:49] the building 10 days
[1:31:51] amen unified on one promise they didn't
[1:31:54] come to be seen they didn't come to be
[1:31:56] heard they didn't come amen to exercise
[1:31:59] their abilities they come for a promise
[1:32:02] of god in their life and god had made a
[1:32:04] promise and he was there to fulfill a
[1:32:06] promise upon their life ten days into it
[1:32:09] the bible said when the day of pentecost
[1:32:11] had fully come
[1:32:13] when the day of pentecost had fully come
[1:32:15] now y'all know that was a y'all know
[1:32:17] that was a tradition down there in
[1:32:19] jerusalem
[1:32:20] and there was a bunch of pentecostals
[1:32:22] out there in the streets
[1:32:24] amen that's what they were all doing
[1:32:26] there that morning they were all in the
[1:32:28] streets but those 120 were in an upper
[1:32:30] room
[1:32:32] they were actually not the pentecostals
[1:32:34] they were the church of the firstborn
[1:32:36] and the pentecostas were the
[1:32:38] traditionals of that time but when the
[1:32:40] pillar of fire came in the room it was a
[1:32:43] fulfillment of the promise of god and
[1:32:45] the dynamics of the spirit came into
[1:32:47] their lives now let me tell you what
[1:32:49] he'd done it quicken them
[1:32:50] [Applause]
[1:32:52] it quickened their lives it didn't just
[1:32:54] come in and tingle them a little bit it
[1:32:56] quickened their mortal bodies amen
[1:32:58] brother braham said it's so quick in
[1:33:00] them it quickened their language i know
[1:33:02] people can't hardly stand the idea of
[1:33:04] speaking in tongues anymore i don't know
[1:33:06] what bible you're reading
[1:33:08] i don't know what i don't know what book
[1:33:10] of acts you've been reading lately but i
[1:33:12] think it was three out of five times and
[1:33:14] somebody received the holy ghost they
[1:33:16] actually did speak in tongues and we're
[1:33:18] not going to pentecostal doctrine i know
[1:33:20] there's some critics out there that'll
[1:33:21] clip that and make it say whatever they
[1:33:23] wanted to say but there's a reality to
[1:33:25] these things for him god didn't die amen
[1:33:28] we are a continuation of the book of
[1:33:30] acts and whatever they did there they
[1:33:33] ought to do in the house of god it
[1:33:35] should be a revival
[1:33:45] why are people so messed up with
[1:33:46] somebody having a gift why they get so
[1:33:49] cranked away somebody having a gift they
[1:33:51] would hate the book of acts the book of
[1:33:53] acts men were not afraid of the gifts
[1:33:55] that god put in their lives they used
[1:33:58] those gifts
[1:33:59] come on you keep letting them do it and
[1:34:01] they won't have one gift left they've
[1:34:02] already took out the tongues they took
[1:34:04] out the prophecy they took out the
[1:34:06] vision they took out the spirit of
[1:34:07] knowledge and wisdom they took it all
[1:34:09] out now they're after you preachers you
[1:34:11] set still long enough and they won't
[1:34:13] even be a gift of a preacher in a pulpit
[1:34:15] no more amen but i think it's high time
[1:34:17] and we lose our fear of these books of
[1:34:20] devils that's come against the church of
[1:34:22] the living god pick up your oxnard pick
[1:34:25] up your bible and fight back for the
[1:34:28] grace of god for your children for your
[1:34:31] children's children for your churches
[1:34:34] for the bride of christ if there ever
[1:34:36] was an hour to rise up and put a voice
[1:34:39] against the devil this is your hour
[1:34:49] i can't help it i'm an american
[1:34:52] i'm an american i was there with patrick
[1:34:54] henry when he gave the speech
[1:34:57] i was there
[1:34:58] little man said i was you know what he
[1:35:00] told him he said don't wait till we
[1:35:02] don't have no guns left
[1:35:05] don't wait till there's an englishman in
[1:35:06] every house don't wait until we're to a
[1:35:09] place that we cannot defend ourselves to
[1:35:12] decide to get some liberty here
[1:35:17] you know what they told patrick we'll
[1:35:19] make a deal with the devil he said how's
[1:35:21] that worked out for you so far
[1:35:23] everything you give up they took more
[1:35:26] let me tell you this you'll never work
[1:35:27] out a deal with the devil
[1:35:31] you give him an inch of ground and he'll
[1:35:33] want to mile tomorrow
[1:35:35] and if you think you're going to get
[1:35:36] peace out of giving up something you're
[1:35:38] sad the devil has fooled you to think if
[1:35:41] you'll lay down peace will come in the
[1:35:43] church peace is not going to come as
[1:35:46] long as there's a devil alive but i
[1:35:48] think the church of the living god has
[1:35:50] got an authority and a right today to
[1:35:53] tell that devil get back in your place
[1:35:56] satan
[1:35:59] there's a bloodline
[1:36:01] it's the word of god and we'll knock
[1:36:04] back up and we'll not let it go
[1:36:12] give me liberty or give me death
[1:36:17] give me liberty give me liberty to
[1:36:20] preach the word of god to see the
[1:36:22] dynamics come
[1:36:29] this is not just another message
[1:36:32] this is the message of our king
[1:36:38] that's exactly what happened when jesus
[1:36:40] come up out of the resurrection and come
[1:36:41] back into the father's throne he was
[1:36:43] carrying a vindicated word of
[1:36:45] resurrection
[1:36:47] he was the king's message
[1:36:51] brother brown tells us a powerful story
[1:36:52] about that
[1:36:54] david livingstone over in africa
[1:36:56] don't remember that
[1:36:58] he was a missionary
[1:36:59] and he wanted to bring something to them
[1:37:00] africans
[1:37:02] but there was always something in the
[1:37:03] way
[1:37:04] those tribes that were so much fighting
[1:37:06] in the tribes
[1:37:10] amen that if he seemed identified with
[1:37:12] one or the other he'd get killed before
[1:37:14] he could ever get the message preached
[1:37:18] that same devil's living today
[1:37:20] [Applause]
[1:37:22] sure
[1:37:23] you use a good quote on the founders
[1:37:25] that's wonders
[1:37:27] that ain't nothing but a scarecrow to
[1:37:29] keep one of the most powerful sermons
[1:37:31] you ever heard from your ears
[1:37:35] see all these tribes
[1:37:36] but you know what david livingstone did
[1:37:38] he wanted to deliver a message to those
[1:37:40] people
[1:37:41] so he went to the tribe leader to the
[1:37:44] chief
[1:37:44] and he made a deal with him
[1:37:46] and he told him he said we'll exchange
[1:37:48] something we become blood brothers and
[1:37:50] remember the tribe chief asked for
[1:37:52] something amen and david gave of him and
[1:37:56] when the chief of the tribe said but
[1:37:57] what do you have david he said i'll tell
[1:37:59] you what i'll take i'll take your spear
[1:38:02] because that was a i believe it was a
[1:38:04] spear amen it was a tribal ceremony
[1:38:06] spear that all the tribes in the area
[1:38:09] knew belonged to that king
[1:38:11] so he said i'll take that
[1:38:13] and the prophet of god explains and he
[1:38:15] said what his what his thoughts was is
[1:38:17] it seemed like he could have greater
[1:38:18] things
[1:38:19] but he knew that that would be life to
[1:38:22] him
[1:38:22] see see i'm paraphrasing but that would
[1:38:24] be life to him in other words if he had
[1:38:27] that spear whenever he come toward a
[1:38:29] tribe and they started running at him
[1:38:31] all he had to do was hold up that spear
[1:38:34] and they would have to back away
[1:38:36] now there were fierce tribes
[1:38:38] they could devour a man in a minute and
[1:38:40] skin him out they were fierce tribes
[1:38:42] them tribes wasn't tame them tribes
[1:38:44] wasn't calm or amen they wasn't full of
[1:38:46] fear but what he had in his hand
[1:38:49] was greater than what was in their
[1:38:52] tribes
[1:38:53] and all you had to do was hold it up and
[1:38:54] they would recognize he's got the king's
[1:38:57] message he's representing somebody
[1:38:59] greater than him now you hear me and
[1:39:02] today god has put a message in our hands
[1:39:05] amen that here we are amen in satan's
[1:39:08] eden and the devil's like a roaring lion
[1:39:11] he ain't lost none of his power he's as
[1:39:13] powerful as he ever was but god has put
[1:39:16] something in your hand
[1:39:18] he's put something in your hand that
[1:39:20] satan has to bow every time he hears the
[1:39:24] name of jesus christ
[1:39:34] amen i believe today god put something
[1:39:36] at hand it's the dynamics of the church
[1:39:39] and the dynamics is
[1:39:41] the holy spirit
[1:39:43] case settled
[1:39:45] dynamics is the holy spirit direct quote
[1:39:48] case settled
[1:39:50] hey it's this it's that it's this it's
[1:39:53] the holy spirit
[1:39:55] it's god coming into his church
[1:39:58] filling them in the form of the bride of
[1:40:01] jesus christ now i'm going to read
[1:40:03] something familiar to you because i want
[1:40:04] to get a point out of it and i don't
[1:40:06] it's not so much just to stay there i
[1:40:08] want to get a point there now remember
[1:40:10] this
[1:40:12] that christ in the true church
[1:40:14] is a continuation of the book of acts
[1:40:22] let's let that pause
[1:40:24] christ
[1:40:26] in the true church
[1:40:28] is a continuation
[1:40:30] of the book of acts
[1:40:31] look at what he says
[1:40:33] but the book of rights
[1:40:35] maybe the book of revelation will show
[1:40:36] how that the antichrist spirit
[1:40:40] will come into the church and defile it
[1:40:43] making it lukewarm
[1:40:45] formal
[1:40:47] and powerless
[1:40:50] can you imagine
[1:40:51] the temple of god's dynamics powers
[1:40:56] can you imagine the bride of all the
[1:40:59] ages
[1:41:01] powers
[1:41:02] it's a preacher can it happen you take
[1:41:04] the dynamics of it in your powers
[1:41:09] see but the book of revelation shows
[1:41:11] that how he would try to defile it
[1:41:13] make it look more formal and powerless
[1:41:15] it exposes satan the revealing of his
[1:41:19] works the attempted destruction
[1:41:23] of god's people and the discrediting
[1:41:26] of god's word
[1:41:28] right down to the time he is cast in the
[1:41:30] lake of fire he fights that
[1:41:33] he cannot stand it he knows
[1:41:36] that if the people get the true
[1:41:38] revelation
[1:41:39] of the true church now watch the true
[1:41:41] revelation the true church he just told
[1:41:43] you
[1:41:44] he said remember the true church is a
[1:41:46] continuation of the book of acts if you
[1:41:48] accept what the prophet said on that
[1:41:50] then the true church the book of acts
[1:41:53] amen she'll find out what she is then
[1:41:57] let me let me just say this and without
[1:41:59] time to preach these things i just want
[1:42:01] to make a statement here what she is is
[1:42:03] pretty powerful
[1:42:06] what she is if you look back in the
[1:42:08] scripture she's all that
[1:42:10] that god thought of in the back part of
[1:42:12] his mind
[1:42:16] come on you think of esther is powerful
[1:42:18] you're greater than esther
[1:42:20] you think of rahab is powerful you're
[1:42:22] greater than rahab
[1:42:24] you think a sheba is powerful you're
[1:42:26] greater than sheba they were your type
[1:42:30] you're not theirs they were yours
[1:42:33] amen they made a type of what was coming
[1:42:36] in the last days of what god was going
[1:42:38] to do amen what she is is a powerful
[1:42:41] thing but what she stands for is a
[1:42:43] greater power
[1:42:45] i'll tell you this amen i have come to
[1:42:47] the place amen where i have decided that
[1:42:50] i am going to fight for what i stand for
[1:42:54] [Applause]
[1:42:56] what i stand for
[1:42:58] i do not have the time to run down every
[1:43:01] false doctrine that comes up in that
[1:43:03] world today there's thousands of them
[1:43:05] there's thousands of doctrines there's
[1:43:07] thousands of ways amen but there is
[1:43:10] something we can stand for
[1:43:11] and what we can stand for is the message
[1:43:14] of the hour the way the prophet preached
[1:43:17] it
[1:43:18] come on church you cannot separate this
[1:43:21] bible and that message and never come up
[1:43:23] with the truth what william branham was
[1:43:25] preaching was not something outside the
[1:43:27] bible i get so tired of those dumb
[1:43:30] questions amen would you take the bible
[1:43:32] would you take the message what a dumb
[1:43:34] question
[1:43:36] what a dumb question like brother
[1:43:38] branham was preaching something
[1:43:39] different than the bible
[1:43:42] he was only explaining what he was
[1:43:44] reading so it could be broke into
[1:43:45] revelation to give you an authority
[1:43:48] concerning the scripture you're reading
[1:43:54] people run around with these foolish
[1:43:56] questions it's only to trip you up amen
[1:43:59] but you got to know what you stand for
[1:44:01] and you're going to fall for anything i
[1:44:03] tell you what i stand for is this word
[1:44:05] of god without fear or without failure i
[1:44:09] stand for the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:44:11] as the dynamics in the church the same
[1:44:14] one that fell in the book of acts has
[1:44:17] returned again amen as a refilling in
[1:44:20] the last days
[1:44:21] i stand for a church that is full of
[1:44:23] worship i stand for a church with the
[1:44:26] power of god and sweep into the building
[1:44:28] and there's somebody alive enough to
[1:44:31] know that it's happening
[1:44:38] amen let somebody know that jesus is
[1:44:41] passing by this way this morning
[1:44:45] i stand i stand for creation by the word
[1:44:48] of god i stand that the word of god
[1:44:50] spoken can change alcohol it can change
[1:44:53] tobacco problems it can change less
[1:44:56] problems i believe that the power of god
[1:44:58] can change lives and ours as it's spoken
[1:45:01] in power
[1:45:03] i stand at the idea that one service can
[1:45:06] change your entire life
[1:45:10] that's why i stand for the preaching of
[1:45:13] the gospel of jesus christ not just some
[1:45:16] reading not just some tape playing but
[1:45:19] let the anointing of god get a hold of
[1:45:21] his word and fix things
[1:45:25] we don't know how to fix
[1:45:30] situations in lies people are stuck down
[1:45:32] maybe they got offices they got
[1:45:34] something going on they can't tell
[1:45:35] nobody amen but you can't hide it from
[1:45:37] god
[1:45:39] you might hide it from a man you can't
[1:45:41] hide it from god and god will discern
[1:45:44] that faith while a man's preaching and
[1:45:46] supernatural words will come out of his
[1:45:48] mouth and the power of god are usable he
[1:45:50] might not ever know your name he might
[1:45:52] not ever know it's you but god has his
[1:45:54] way just the same and things are exposed
[1:45:57] in lies by the preaching of the gospel
[1:46:00] have we forgot that it's written amen by
[1:46:02] the foolishness of preaching that men
[1:46:06] might be saved
[1:46:11] i still believe in letting the power of
[1:46:14] the holy ghost take a hold of lies and
[1:46:16] change them i still believe in altar
[1:46:18] calls i still believe in people praying
[1:46:20] their way through spirits until they
[1:46:22] break out into a dimension of life and
[1:46:25] truth
[1:46:28] i stand for it i stand for prayer lines
[1:46:31] where people have been standing there
[1:46:33] and you put your hands on them
[1:46:37] it's a preacher why in the world you
[1:46:38] want a prayer line in this age i was
[1:46:40] just listening 1964 last night and a
[1:46:42] prophet standing there with a woman took
[1:46:44] his wrist watch off laid his hand on the
[1:46:46] lady and he starts praying for her he
[1:46:49] said now i'm going to pray you watch my
[1:46:50] hand
[1:46:52] he said now look when i lay my hand on
[1:46:54] you see the vibrations he said that
[1:46:56] vibrations is a live ulcer in your body
[1:46:58] he said now you watch my hand while i
[1:47:00] pray and while the prophet's hand was on
[1:47:03] the woman he began to pray and she
[1:47:05] looked up and she said it's gone he said
[1:47:08] he said now i'm going to take my hand
[1:47:09] off i'm going to give it to you again
[1:47:11] and she said it's gone he said do you
[1:47:13] see by the sign in the hand i could
[1:47:15] pronounce to you it's gone do you think
[1:47:18] that that god that did that is
[1:47:20] somewhere's off in another dimension or
[1:47:23] another planet but that god is right
[1:47:25] here in this building this morning
[1:47:32] for in my name they shall cast out
[1:47:35] devils they shall heal the sick
[1:47:40] james 5 and 14 said if there be any sick
[1:47:43] among you let him call for the elders of
[1:47:45] the church anoint him live with whole
[1:47:47] and if they be in his sins let them
[1:47:49] confess them and they will be forgiven
[1:47:52] and their bodies will be healed
[1:47:54] [Applause]
[1:47:56] so brother wayne i'm scared of that
[1:47:57] stuff well peter was too when peter was
[1:48:00] on the water and jesus was standing out
[1:48:02] there he was afraid of what that was he
[1:48:04] didn't know what is it if it was god i'd
[1:48:07] go to it but you know what a little
[1:48:09] while the voice spoke out of the
[1:48:10] darkness and said it is i
[1:48:13] be not afraid
[1:48:14] you know what that boy said to peter he
[1:48:16] said come on if you want to walk on the
[1:48:19] water come on
[1:48:21] if you want to walk in the impossible
[1:48:23] come on
[1:48:24] amen you say well that's amazing do you
[1:48:26] know that brother branham compared that
[1:48:27] with exactly james 5 he said it was the
[1:48:30] word that told peter to walk on that
[1:48:32] water and it was the word to told you to
[1:48:34] lay your hands on the sick now i'm not
[1:48:37] here to look at the circumstances i'm
[1:48:39] not here to look at the trouble i am
[1:48:41] here to fulfill the commission of the
[1:48:43] word of god and god is here to back up
[1:48:46] the plan that he made for every
[1:48:48] individual in this building
[1:48:54] i tell you what i stand for i stand for
[1:48:56] preaching truth
[1:48:59] no matter who it appeals don't matter
[1:49:01] what happens i believe and stand for the
[1:49:03] idea of preaching truth because it's the
[1:49:05] truth that'll set you free
[1:49:08] so brother wayne why are you doing this
[1:49:10] because brother random said if you would
[1:49:11] do this and you'd find out who you are
[1:49:14] and you'd find out what you stand for
[1:49:16] that you would find that you can do the
[1:49:18] greater works
[1:49:21] oh somebody get that devil and set him
[1:49:23] back up i think he just passed out
[1:49:26] brother wayne john 14 12 that's just for
[1:49:29] the prophet what line devil done told
[1:49:31] you that
[1:49:33] the bible said he that believeth have i
[1:49:36] read my bible wrong
[1:49:38] but he that believeth on me the works
[1:49:40] that i do shall you do also and greater
[1:49:43] works and this shall you do for i go
[1:49:49] unto my father let me put it like this
[1:49:52] jesus christ is sitting in power this
[1:49:55] morning and he is our husband and the
[1:49:58] spirit of him is in the earth his body's
[1:50:00] there his spirit is here and now we are
[1:50:04] his body on the earth now what can he do
[1:50:09] now what part of the gospel can he not
[1:50:11] perform being that you are the temple of
[1:50:13] the holy ghost the dynamics of god are
[1:50:16] you going to limit god just because
[1:50:18] where he is are you going to limit god
[1:50:21] just because he's here in the church i'm
[1:50:23] not going to do it i'm going to take the
[1:50:25] limits off i'm going to tell you that
[1:50:27] this bride has an unlimited resource of
[1:50:31] the power of god
[1:50:38] oh and she'll recognize this he said
[1:50:40] well the wayne greater weren't that's
[1:50:42] scary stuff man well let me just break
[1:50:44] into that greater works a minute
[1:50:47] anybody ever heard of a greater meaning
[1:50:49] of greater works
[1:50:51] brother brown teaches it
[1:50:53] he actually tells us
[1:50:54] that when jesus prophesied that over his
[1:50:56] own disciples there was only one of him
[1:50:59] and he knew the gospel would go in the
[1:51:01] world
[1:51:02] so for years the translation of that
[1:51:03] scripture meant that would be more
[1:51:06] there would be more people doing it so
[1:51:08] it would be a greater work being done
[1:51:11] so people all over the world
[1:51:13] you don't think he didn't know do you
[1:51:15] you don't think he didn't know we'd be
[1:51:16] preaching this in the western
[1:51:17] civilization amen 2 000 years later and
[1:51:20] he was saying the works that i do shall
[1:51:23] you do and greater works shall ye do
[1:51:27] do you see because he did them amen we
[1:51:29] see his works therefore we do what he
[1:51:32] did
[1:51:34] now notice it's a greater work right
[1:51:35] it's more how many knows the next stage
[1:51:38] brother bam took that too and he said
[1:51:40] what happened was he said jesus when he
[1:51:42] was here was not preaching the baptism
[1:51:44] of the holy ghost
[1:51:47] he said so when he said greater works he
[1:51:50] was saying they would preach something
[1:51:51] greater than he did
[1:51:54] preach something greater than jesus
[1:51:55] that's what he said he said jesus was
[1:51:57] not preaching the baptism of the holy
[1:51:59] ghost he said but the disciples were
[1:52:01] commissioned to do it and by doing so
[1:52:03] they would impart eternal life
[1:52:06] [Applause]
[1:52:08] come on church the preaching the baptism
[1:52:10] of the holy ghost is not some poli some
[1:52:12] politics or some pentecostal dogma it's
[1:52:15] the way of life
[1:52:17] it's how god comes into his church
[1:52:21] he was saying
[1:52:22] brother wayne i don't believe we can
[1:52:23] impart life i don't know who can or who
[1:52:25] came but i know what brother branham
[1:52:27] said he said a son of god can
[1:52:30] a son of god can do it because he has
[1:52:33] something in him to project the dynamics
[1:52:36] that's on the inside let me take you to
[1:52:38] the let me take you to the day of
[1:52:40] pentecost amen for the first time amen
[1:52:42] in two thousand four thousand years when
[1:52:45] a man was back in authority with god
[1:52:47] apostle peter standing there with the
[1:52:48] holy ghost amen they asked him what can
[1:52:51] we do to be saved he said repent every
[1:52:53] one of you and be baptized in the name
[1:52:55] of jesus christ with our mission your
[1:52:57] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:53:00] the holy ghost
[1:53:02] and when he said that 3 000 souls were
[1:53:06] added to the kingdom of god how did they
[1:53:08] get in the kingdom of eternal life
[1:53:10] because peter preached the message he
[1:53:13] preached truth unto him amen you see why
[1:53:16] i don't understand well let's go to the
[1:53:18] gentiles house then in the book of acts
[1:53:20] when peter come to the house of
[1:53:21] cornelius
[1:53:24] an angel had been down there talking
[1:53:25] with cornelius
[1:53:27] an angel had been discussing cornelius
[1:53:30] we have seen your arms we have heard
[1:53:32] your prayers amen but you need to ask
[1:53:34] peter to come down here and to tell you
[1:53:36] what's going on
[1:53:37] brother man said why if an angel was
[1:53:39] standing there did peter have to go down
[1:53:42] there he said because life was in the
[1:53:44] body
[1:53:45] because life was in that man the life
[1:53:48] amen the germ of god would be spoken
[1:53:52] through the words of a man anointed with
[1:53:55] the holy ghost
[1:53:56] and while peter yet spake unto
[1:53:59] cornelius's house they were filled with
[1:54:01] the holy ghost
[1:54:04] come on church we are a continuation of
[1:54:07] the book of acts and i believe right
[1:54:09] here this morning there may be people
[1:54:11] who come to this meeting looking for the
[1:54:12] holy ghost and they're wondering how to
[1:54:14] get the holy ghost amen but the bible
[1:54:16] said while he yet spake i believe
[1:54:19] there's people sitting here right now
[1:54:21] that you don't have to wait 10 days you
[1:54:23] don't have to wait 10 minutes i believe
[1:54:25] while the bible is being preached
[1:54:28] there's a power coming out of this place
[1:54:30] at the holy ghost
[1:54:34] come on you feel the charge of it in the
[1:54:36] building go ahead and receive it
[1:54:39] you feel the power of it go ahead and
[1:54:41] receive it you don't have to wait
[1:54:43] another day or another hour you don't
[1:54:45] have to wait until a prayer line or
[1:54:47] somebody to lay their hands amen christ
[1:54:50] is here the dynamics of god
[1:54:53] [Applause]
[1:55:00] greater works
[1:55:01] come on there's one more greater meaning
[1:55:03] to that a prophet of god said very
[1:55:05] clearly that that greater worst was a
[1:55:07] spoken word
[1:55:08] shalom 1964 said that jesus took bread
[1:55:12] and multiplied to fish and multiplied he
[1:55:15] said but when moses throwed up the dirt
[1:55:17] it multiplied
[1:55:18] he said but when i was out there in the
[1:55:19] woods the other day
[1:55:22] i was out there in the woods the other
[1:55:23] day
[1:55:25] he said there wasn't no squirrel there
[1:55:28] there wasn't nothing there but the angel
[1:55:30] told me about mark 11 chapter why didn't
[1:55:33] the angel create that squirrel
[1:55:35] why didn't the angel do the creating
[1:55:37] because it had come back into the body
[1:55:40] of jesus christ the very god the very
[1:55:42] creator of heaven and earth that stood
[1:55:44] and created the first squirrel was
[1:55:47] actually being moved into the dynamic
[1:55:49] power in a mortal man a man born of a
[1:55:53] woman a man with mistakes a man was sin
[1:55:56] but a man who had been baptized with the
[1:55:58] holy ghost and fire had been cleaned up
[1:56:01] and had become a tabernacle of the deity
[1:56:04] of god and he could speak the word
[1:56:09] let there be and there was
[1:56:15] plum shocks people when you call it a
[1:56:17] tabernacle of deity
[1:56:19] them deity people run wild with that
[1:56:21] didn't they well let me tell you it's
[1:56:23] the truth if you place it right
[1:56:26] he said preacher what are you saying i'm
[1:56:28] saying this is not the prophecy i will
[1:56:30] be with you
[1:56:31] this is not emmanuel
[1:56:33] god did not make a promise in this age
[1:56:35] i'll be with you he added something to
[1:56:37] it and said i'll be with you even in you
[1:56:41] he was he was with a prophet and the
[1:56:43] prophet was with us but if that's as far
[1:56:46] as it goes you ain't arrived yet you
[1:56:49] need another step in the grace of god
[1:56:52] until the dynamics of god comes into
[1:56:55] your life with power and authority
[1:57:00] deity's not in heaven it's in the church
[1:57:03] of the living god and it's been baptized
[1:57:10] hallelujah let every devil out of hell
[1:57:13] say it ain't soul
[1:57:16] we are right now the sons of god
[1:57:20] i know they think i'm crazy it's all
[1:57:22] right i mean i feel pretty good the way
[1:57:24] i feel
[1:57:27] but by the way we'll be sons
[1:57:30] we'll be sons over when we get our body
[1:57:31] changed
[1:57:32] true enough
[1:57:34] true enough fullness of doctrines to
[1:57:36] change the body i can go there with you
[1:57:38] but what about first john the third
[1:57:39] chapter
[1:57:41] we are now the sons
[1:57:43] what about ephesians chapter one we have
[1:57:45] been lifted up in heavenly places in
[1:57:48] christ
[1:57:50] jesus come on church
[1:57:54] you don't think that was every age doing
[1:57:56] that now do you
[1:57:59] so brother wayne what do you mean
[1:58:00] i mean jesus was asked the question
[1:58:03] can my sons said it's your left hand and
[1:58:06] your right hand he said no
[1:58:09] it's not even my position to give for my
[1:58:11] father in heaven has already assigned it
[1:58:14] to somebody else and brother brown said
[1:58:16] those son bodies were the overcomers of
[1:58:19] the laodicean age there is a place that
[1:58:22] you have been put in in this hour you
[1:58:24] have been made an astronaut of god
[1:58:28] you've been made an eagle of god
[1:58:32] somebody that can believe every word
[1:58:34] somebody that can fly higher in any
[1:58:37] other age you can fly into a realm come
[1:58:40] on folks we're not being filled with the
[1:58:42] holy ghost to go back into the ages
[1:58:44] you're being filled with the holy ghost
[1:58:46] with the changing of your bodies
[1:58:54] tell me i'm wrong
[1:58:56] the lighter glory will be greater than
[1:58:58] the former glory
[1:59:01] you know it's you know where that comes
[1:59:02] from when they were leaving babylon
[1:59:05] amen under the when babylon switched
[1:59:07] from babylon to persia and they were
[1:59:09] leaving the bible said the handwriting
[1:59:11] come on the wall and only daniel could
[1:59:13] read it and when the mystery was
[1:59:15] revealed
[1:59:16] it was judgment to babylon and the death
[1:59:19] of their leader
[1:59:21] but it had another message to those
[1:59:22] israelites
[1:59:24] it had another message to them saints it
[1:59:27] meant the years of their captivity was
[1:59:30] ended
[1:59:31] it meant they were being loosed to
[1:59:33] return to the worship of jerusalem
[1:59:41] come on they were going to go back and
[1:59:43] worship under the revelation of who they
[1:59:46] were born to be as abraham's seed and so
[1:59:49] has this babylonian age this spiritual
[1:59:52] age there has been a handwriting on the
[1:59:54] wall of judgment that's come against it
[1:59:57] but it has a different message to the
[1:59:59] ride
[2:00:00] you know what it means to the bride it
[2:00:02] means their day of reign is over the
[2:00:04] devil has done all he can do amen to the
[2:00:07] pride of jesus christ god has lifted
[2:00:09] this church above reason and doubt and
[2:00:12] fear and unbelief and has took us back
[2:00:15] to the original church in the beginning
[2:00:18] full of dynamic power full of the
[2:00:21] promises of god
[2:00:25] somebody said well if you were you
[2:00:27] wasn't so if you wasn't so empty you
[2:00:29] wouldn't be so loud well i'll tell you
[2:00:30] there's a bride today full they're so
[2:00:32] full of dynamic power you're hearing
[2:00:35] sounds of freedom you're hearing sounds
[2:00:37] of grace you're hearing sounds of
[2:00:39] authority you're hearing sounds of
[2:00:41] breakthrough
[2:00:45] i am tired of those fundamental formal
[2:00:48] devils coming against the church of the
[2:00:51] living god i say we ought to release our
[2:00:53] faith and release the grace of god
[2:01:02] satan will be powerless before her
[2:01:05] she will be
[2:01:07] she will be an invincible army
[2:01:09] if they get the true revelation of those
[2:01:12] two spirits these are two spirits
[2:01:13] brother braham said that spirit was an
[2:01:15] antichrist spirit which is a religious
[2:01:17] spirit
[2:01:19] it was a religious spirit crucified him
[2:01:21] the first time
[2:01:22] what do you think it is crucifying this
[2:01:24] holy ghost today
[2:01:26] his crucifixion is not coming from a
[2:01:28] cross it's coming from pulpits
[2:01:32] crucifying him but the day they do it
[2:01:34] they are no longer an effective place of
[2:01:36] worship
[2:01:37] the spirit of god moves on amen but
[2:01:40] wherever there are people who will
[2:01:42] assemble under the power of the blood
[2:01:45] there is a god that will meet them in
[2:01:47] that place of worship
[2:01:51] it's an invincible army
[2:01:53] that's what they are indestructible
[2:01:55] they can't be beat
[2:01:57] invincible means it it's not it's not
[2:01:59] within their capability of being beat
[2:02:04] i know people don't understand us
[2:02:07] i know they don't understand how we're
[2:02:08] still here
[2:02:11] but there's nothing in my genetic makeup
[2:02:14] that says quite
[2:02:21] i've got the ignore button
[2:02:26] i've got the i won't listen to you
[2:02:27] button
[2:02:29] i've got the i don't want to hear what
[2:02:30] you got to say button
[2:02:32] but i don't have the quit button
[2:02:34] it was not designed in me
[2:02:36] because before i quit i will change
[2:02:39] before i quit i've got to have a change
[2:02:41] in my body
[2:02:46] don't quit
[2:02:48] not in these people not in this church
[2:02:50] not in this bride you see what they'll
[2:02:52] be able to do they'll be able to
[2:02:53] withstand
[2:02:55] i love this
[2:02:57] wrist stand means to resist
[2:03:00] it actually means to put up a fight
[2:03:03] they'll put a fight up with this thing
[2:03:06] they won't just let the devil come and
[2:03:08] rob them of everything god gave them
[2:03:11] they'll put up a fight they'll see it's
[2:03:12] a religious spirit
[2:03:14] and they'll put a fight up against it
[2:03:16] now how do you fight that thing
[2:03:18] well the man said well just do opposite
[2:03:22] if you think somebody's mad by them
[2:03:23] something
[2:03:25] if you've got a complex do the opposite
[2:03:26] the hair off the dog's back is good for
[2:03:28] the bite
[2:03:33] that's hillbilly ain't it
[2:03:36] the bad thing is i flat understood what
[2:03:38] he meant
[2:03:40] didn't he know in translation for that
[2:03:41] one for me
[2:03:43] i'd been dog bit and i knew the only
[2:03:44] thing help it's a dog hair off its back
[2:03:48] you say preacher what are you really
[2:03:49] saying i'm saying that she's invincible
[2:03:52] [Applause]
[2:03:54] i'm standing for the fact that she is
[2:03:56] invincible
[2:03:58] i'm saying in matthew 24 that the
[2:04:00] deception will be so great in the last
[2:04:02] days it would deceive the elect
[2:04:06] if
[2:04:08] if possible
[2:04:10] but according to this message it ain't
[2:04:13] possible
[2:04:20] so you know what you tell the devil said
[2:04:21] go on
[2:04:23] listen i'm not going to listen to his
[2:04:25] nonsense i don't have time to fight with
[2:04:27] the devil i don't have time we've got to
[2:04:30] preach a message we've got to get people
[2:04:32] saved we've got to get our lives full of
[2:04:35] the grace of god so we can change our
[2:04:37] bodies
[2:04:41] now
[2:04:41] this church will stand withstand it will
[2:04:44] resist
[2:04:45] and satan will be powerless
[2:04:49] it will be powerless before her i'm
[2:04:52] running out of time for him right now
[2:04:53] message satan will be powerless before
[2:04:55] her
[2:04:57] now i think i think brother brother
[2:04:59] reagan done as good a job last night as
[2:05:01] i've ever heard someone describing
[2:05:03] the power of satan in laodicea
[2:05:07] that was good man
[2:05:09] sorry
[2:05:11] it was powerful
[2:05:13] and what he explained to us all very
[2:05:16] carefully was satan hasn't lost his
[2:05:19] power
[2:05:20] don't you think for a moment you're a
[2:05:22] match for that devil
[2:05:24] don't you take this quote run out there
[2:05:26] and say i'm going to whip the devil no
[2:05:28] you ain't you're going to get the whip
[2:05:29] of your life
[2:05:31] i can point to you amen hundreds of
[2:05:33] wrecks
[2:05:34] of people that was that arrogant
[2:05:37] i can point you to tons of people that
[2:05:40] thought that very thing
[2:05:42] amen but it says satan will be powerless
[2:05:44] before her it doesn't mean he's
[2:05:46] powerless it means he's powerless before
[2:05:49] her
[2:05:51] you say how is he powerless before her
[2:05:53] listen there's a secret laying brother
[2:05:55] man says it right here but as he was
[2:05:57] talking last night that line if you go
[2:05:59] back to the book of daniel when they
[2:06:01] told daniel if you don't quit praying
[2:06:03] and worshiping
[2:06:04] if you don't quit worshiping your god
[2:06:06] and worship our god of babylon we're
[2:06:09] going to put you in a den of lines you

[2:07:59] it
[2:08:00] and they said just because you wouldn't
[2:08:02] bow to us we're going to throw you in
[2:08:04] the dead of lines
[2:08:06] a lot different lines then then of lines
[2:08:08] headlines in it you know
[2:08:11] and the king couldn't deliver him could
[2:08:12] he
[2:08:13] he actually told daniel
[2:08:15] i can't get you out of this daniel
[2:08:17] but the god you serve
[2:08:21] the god you serve he'll deliver thee
[2:08:26] and the doctors might not be able to
[2:08:29] the doctors might not be able to but the
[2:08:31] god you serve
[2:08:33] the god of your fathers
[2:08:35] the god of abraham he is more than able
[2:08:38] to deliver thee
[2:08:43] and i'll not pull the curtains i believe
[2:08:45] and i believe he's a god over cancer i
[2:08:47] believe it's a god over every disease i
[2:08:49] believe he's a god and has a dominion
[2:08:51] over every devil and every power in the
[2:08:54] pits of hell i'm not serving a weak god
[2:08:57] i'm not serving the laodicean god i am
[2:09:00] serving the god of all the heavens
[2:09:03] jehovah is his name and he is the god of
[2:09:06] all miracles
[2:09:12] the bible records they through daniel in
[2:09:13] that den
[2:09:16] and the king didn't sleep all night long
[2:09:22] he didn't sleep all night long
[2:09:24] he was worried about what's going on
[2:09:25] down there with daniel
[2:09:28] and all the while daniel was sleeping
[2:09:30] like a baby
[2:09:34] now lord can you imagine
[2:09:36] daniel in the lion's den
[2:09:38] with him dean of lines all swirling
[2:09:40] around him
[2:09:41] brother bram said when he stepped down
[2:09:42] there he backed up in the corner and all
[2:09:44] of a sudden he felt a tingling over his
[2:09:45] flesh
[2:09:47] i guarantee you'll welcome the dynamics
[2:09:49] in that point
[2:09:50] [Applause]
[2:09:51] i guarantee if it's a sensation if it
[2:09:54] was an eye cry if it was tongues if it
[2:09:56] was a vision anything god wanted to do
[2:09:59] at that moment you'd be saying come on
[2:10:01] lord
[2:10:02] come on in here the lions are here as a
[2:10:05] roaring lion he's here to destroy you
[2:10:08] and the only hope you've got is that the
[2:10:10] angel of david and the angel of daniel
[2:10:13] would come in the house of god i don't
[2:10:16] care if it makes me dance or vibrate or
[2:10:18] whatever it does
[2:10:21] just contain the lines
[2:10:23] [Applause]
[2:10:27] look what happened in there
[2:10:29] brother brown said his flesh started
[2:10:30] tingling
[2:10:31] he said the line started backing up
[2:10:35] he said he felt something warm he turned
[2:10:36] around and looked and he said they're
[2:10:37] hung that light
[2:10:41] there hung that light that pillar of
[2:10:42] fire
[2:10:45] daniel
[2:10:46] daniel brought the millennium to babylon
[2:10:52] it was the millennium
[2:10:53] but he could lay down with the lines
[2:10:58] look at this
[2:10:59] put his head on one line
[2:11:01] put his feet on another
[2:11:04] another one snuggled up behind his back
[2:11:05] until he got real good in cushion
[2:11:11] if you knew who you are
[2:11:14] if you only understood
[2:11:16] what it is that's around you right now
[2:11:23] king come the next morning
[2:11:25] he's worried daniel
[2:11:28] daniel
[2:11:29] do you live daniel
[2:11:31] i imagine daniel just held up for a few
[2:11:33] minutes
[2:11:39] finally he said
[2:11:40] okay
[2:11:42] live forever
[2:11:44] i prayed
[2:11:46] remember that thing they didn't want him
[2:11:47] to do
[2:11:50] remember that thing they said didn't
[2:11:51] matter
[2:11:53] remember the thing that he wouldn't shut
[2:11:55] off out of his life
[2:11:57] i prayed
[2:11:59] and the anointing came
[2:12:01] the angel came
[2:12:04] and he delivered me
[2:12:10] i took that all the way through the
[2:12:12] bible the other day i won't do it to you
[2:12:13] tonight amen this morning but i can say
[2:12:15] with authority that was the angel that
[2:12:16] crossed the red sea
[2:12:18] that was the one took down the walls of
[2:12:20] jericho was right there with daniel and
[2:12:22] he was able to do it now you would hear
[2:12:24] that story and you might say to
[2:12:25] yourselves well then we're just hanging
[2:12:28] kittens
[2:12:30] the lions lost their power that's the
[2:12:31] reason they didn't meet daniel
[2:12:33] oh but keep reading the next verse
[2:12:36] it said
[2:12:38] that the king took daniel's accusers
[2:12:43] you don't believe in prayer here you go
[2:12:46] you don't believe in no holy ghost here
[2:12:49] you go you don't believe in dancing in
[2:12:51] the spirit here you go
[2:12:58] the bible said
[2:13:00] before they hit the ground
[2:13:03] the lions had already consumed them and
[2:13:06] had broke their bones let me tell you
[2:13:08] that lion's got a lot of power but the
[2:13:11] holy ghost is the power of god and the
[2:13:14] salvation under authority
[2:13:20] god always does it you might as well put
[2:13:22] the devil on warning tonight
[2:13:24] put him on warning this morning say to
[2:13:26] him satan you might have tried to feed
[2:13:29] me to a line but my god is going to feed
[2:13:32] you to the very line you're trying to
[2:13:34] feed me to
[2:13:38] have i got a haman in the building
[2:13:40] have i got a mordecai in the building
[2:13:43] haven let me tell you something you keep
[2:13:45] planning to destroy mordecai but you'll
[2:13:48] hang on your own gallows
[2:13:53] call david up and ask him what happened
[2:13:56] to goliath i cut his head off with his
[2:13:59] own sword
[2:14:05] no cancer is not powerless
[2:14:08] but there's an angel here
[2:14:10] sickness is not powerless but there's an
[2:14:13] angel here
[2:14:16] demons have power but there's an angel
[2:14:19] here
[2:14:23] the dynamics is here
[2:14:27] that's what you're seeing
[2:14:30] so brother wayne
[2:14:33] i've been wondering i've been here i saw
[2:14:35] maybe some people just here for the
[2:14:36] first time getting among this kind of
[2:14:38] worship and power and they're saying i
[2:14:40] wonder what all this is
[2:14:43] i'll tell you what this is
[2:14:45] this
[2:14:47] is that
[2:14:52] your whole
[2:14:53] life wondered what that is
[2:14:56] this
[2:14:58] is that
[2:15:02] you like that when it's in the bible but
[2:15:05] how do you like this
[2:15:08] i love it brother
[2:15:11] what is it it's the it's the revival
[2:15:15] of the bride
[2:15:18] we've been saying it's coming for years
[2:15:22] but here it is
[2:15:25] don't miss it
[2:15:27] don't miss your opportunity
[2:15:30] don't miss the greatest days of your
[2:15:31] life
[2:15:34] this thing might stop tomorrow
[2:15:36] they may shut our churches down before
[2:15:38] next week this may be the last
[2:15:40] opportunity you ever had to really
[2:15:42] worship and praise god with other
[2:15:44] believers to sing your songs to worship
[2:15:47] your and throw your hands up and rejoice
[2:15:49] in god amen this may be your last
[2:15:52] opportunity to do so don't miss it don't
[2:15:54] let some devil talk you out there
[2:15:58] some tradition somewhere stanford you're
[2:16:01] from worshiping god
[2:16:04] so by wayne
[2:16:06] i don't know if we'll go to heaven
[2:16:07] acting like this
[2:16:08] what do you think we're going to do in
[2:16:10] heaven
[2:16:27] we're not going to sit around read the
[2:16:28] bible in heaven
[2:16:30] jesus is going to be there
[2:16:37] i believe
[2:16:39] i believe right now today i believe this
[2:16:41] very hour
[2:16:42] i believe those angels of god is in this
[2:16:45] building
[2:16:50] i believe the holy ghost himself
[2:16:53] is in this building
[2:16:55] i believe that's the effects that it's
[2:16:58] having not emotional something causes
[2:17:01] emotion
[2:17:03] something's behind the emotion
[2:17:06] and it's the word of the lord
[2:17:09] stimulating i i got a thousand
[2:17:12] scriptures sitting over here at least
[2:17:14] 500.
[2:17:16] it'll say the very same
[2:17:20] it changes things
[2:17:22] right here this morning while we're
[2:17:25] while we're here and we're
[2:17:26] inviting we've opened the curtains
[2:17:30] let the world see
[2:17:32] ashamed of this gospel
[2:17:34] i'm not ashamed to preach it i'm not
[2:17:35] ashamed to quote it i'm not trying to
[2:17:37] stand for it
[2:17:40] says i'll probably give my life for it
[2:17:42] one day
[2:17:44] but that's all right with me
[2:17:46] at least i gave my life for something
[2:17:48] that was good
[2:17:52] i don't want to open up my life but i'm
[2:17:53] the oldest boy out of four
[2:17:57] none of them lived to be over 31 years
[2:17:58] old
[2:17:59] if i didn't leave to be 50 it'd be all
[2:18:01] right with me but at least i gave my
[2:18:02] life to something
[2:18:03] [Applause]
[2:18:07] something i gave my life to
[2:18:09] you've got that opportunity right here
[2:18:10] this morning
[2:18:12] you have to give your life
[2:18:15] now there's a
[2:18:17] there's an enemy spirit
[2:18:20] that our brother ron has been fighting
[2:18:21] for months
[2:18:24] the miracle standing right here
[2:18:28] we are not
[2:18:30] we are not going to let that go by by
[2:18:33] saying it's an accident or coincidence
[2:18:36] or it's just he wasn't that sick
[2:18:39] it's like saying them lines wasn't that
[2:18:41] bad
[2:18:42] [Music]
[2:18:43] but it wasn't that bad because the angel
[2:18:45] was there
[2:18:47] that cancer is mean
[2:18:50] it's attacking his his life to to take
[2:18:53] it prematurely
[2:18:57] but i believe we need ron spencer
[2:19:08] i believe we need
[2:19:26] we're fighting the battle
[2:19:28] and he's one of the generals in this
[2:19:30] battle
[2:19:35] this morning
[2:19:36] as a group
[2:19:38] i know we prayed
[2:19:40] daniel prayed three times a day
[2:19:44] but while we're here this morning
[2:19:47] i know it's not possible for every one
[2:19:49] of you to lay your hands on her brother
[2:19:51] i know that he's not even allowed to
[2:19:53] shake hands with you
[2:19:57] and i know
[2:19:59] every one of you in this film feel the
[2:20:00] way i do amen you'd like to gather
[2:20:03] around him and put your hands on him
[2:20:08] i i this morning
[2:20:12] we're going to give you an opportunity
[2:20:14] to exercise your authority
[2:20:18] as the greatest force on the face of the
[2:20:20] earth
[2:20:24] i'm going to ask you right now
[2:20:26] drop every difference you have with one
[2:20:28] another
[2:20:30] i'm gonna ask you as a family
[2:20:33] if you're sitting here and there's a
[2:20:34] little squirmish going on in your home
[2:20:37] i'm gonna ask you right now drop it
[2:20:42] let it out of your heart
[2:20:44] say lord it's not worth it
[2:20:46] it's not worth it
[2:20:47] i'm letting it go right now
[2:20:50] there's been a little bitterness in your
[2:20:51] life towards someone
[2:20:53] you've been hurt and afflicted
[2:20:56] and you've been carrying that thing and
[2:20:57] it's on your mind all the time
[2:21:00] i'm i'm compelling you
[2:21:03] right now
[2:21:04] drop it
[2:21:08] let it go
[2:21:10] these little doctrinal differences and
[2:21:12] feelings
[2:21:13] little issues
[2:21:15] drop it right now just let it go
[2:21:19] and when you let that go i'm going to
[2:21:21] ask you
[2:21:24] if if you will afford me this
[2:21:26] i'm gonna ask you as a congregation
[2:21:30] if you agree with me
[2:21:32] that you're willing to let go of
[2:21:33] anything in your life
[2:21:35] you're willing to let it go
[2:21:38] would you raise your hand with me like
[2:21:39] this brother wayne i'm gonna let it go

[2:21:47] it back up
[2:21:49] you're gonna leave it laying right here
[2:21:50] this morning
[2:21:52] now with that hand
[2:21:54] i'm going to use the authority of the
[2:21:56] scripture
[2:21:58] a prophet said there was an eternal
[2:22:00] light inside your body
[2:22:03] when you were born again it went from a
[2:22:04] cosmic to an eternal light
[2:22:08] he said so when a believer puts his hand
[2:22:10] on someone
[2:22:12] there is a light that leaves his body
[2:22:14] and goes into the other
[2:22:16] i'm going to ask you now as a believer
[2:22:18] to put your hand upon one another
[2:22:21] according to mark the 16th chapter
[2:22:24] in my name
[2:22:27] shall they cast out devils and shall
[2:22:28] they heal the sick
[2:22:30] in james the fifth chapter it said they
[2:22:31] should anoint them with all
[2:22:34] and here we are this morning with the
[2:22:35] scripture
[2:22:41] we believe the word of god
[2:22:55] you go ahead and start praying now
[2:22:58] i'm going to ask you to welcome
[2:23:01] and awaken jesus this morning
[2:23:06] we'll not close the curtains
[2:23:08] [Music]
[2:23:10] we're not saying that the lines are not
[2:23:11] powerful
[2:23:14] but we're saying that there's an angel
[2:23:15] of deliverance among the church
[2:23:18] and father we rebuke this thing off of
[2:23:20] this body
[2:23:22] [Music]
[2:23:24] i know that it's a cancer
[2:23:26] but greater is he that is in us than he
[2:23:28] that's in this body
[2:23:30] now satan we curse the life
[2:23:33] by the authority the word of god is a
[2:23:35] group of believers
[2:23:37] we have confessed to our sins
[2:23:40] we have laid aside our weights that bear
[2:23:42] us down
[2:23:43] and we have lifted our hands to a holy
[2:23:45] god this morning and we are anointing
[2:23:47] him with whoa
[2:23:48] now in the name of jesus
[2:23:52] satan we are jury thee by the power of
[2:23:54] the living god
[2:23:55] release mark spencer this morning
[2:23:59] we curse you by the blood of jesus
[2:24:02] the very dynamic life of almighty god
[2:24:06] and life would return
[2:24:08] strength would return

[2:42:19] [Music]
[2:42:28] and we have a meal prepared
[2:42:32] for everybody that's here
[2:42:33] you're welcome to eat with us and
[2:42:35] fellowship with us
[2:42:37] we'll be in the fellowship hall and just
[2:42:38] like we've done the other services if
[2:42:40] you come down this hall to get back
[2:42:42] there
[2:42:43] and ask if we can just let the choir the
[2:42:45] evening light tabernacle
[2:42:47] choir go first because we need them back
[2:42:49] in here pretty quickly to
[2:42:52] be able to practice
[2:42:54] [Music]
[2:43:02] as much as possible
[2:43:04] amen
[2:43:06] there's also just really limited seating
[2:43:08] in that area for the crowd that we have
[2:43:10] so we have some extra tables set up
[2:43:12] outside underneath the portico areas
[2:43:14] around by the
[2:43:16] youth activity building so different
[2:43:18] areas to eat once you finish your meal
[2:43:20] if you don't mind getting up
[2:43:23] giving that spot to somebody else that
[2:43:25] needs to eat it will just help with the
[2:43:26] flow
[2:43:28] speaking of getting up
[2:43:30] when you leave today if you can take all
[2:43:32] your stuff with you makes it really hard
[2:43:34] to see people when there's bibles and
[2:43:35] things so
[2:43:37] just except for a few that are helping
[2:43:39] with the booths in the back or the music
[2:43:41] we've tried to not reserve anything we
[2:43:43] ask you to take your belongings with you
[2:43:46] or we will try to scoop them all up
[2:43:48] after the building's emptied
[2:43:50] uh so
[2:43:52] come back early if you want a good seat
[2:43:56] hey man let's
[2:43:58] sing that song key of
