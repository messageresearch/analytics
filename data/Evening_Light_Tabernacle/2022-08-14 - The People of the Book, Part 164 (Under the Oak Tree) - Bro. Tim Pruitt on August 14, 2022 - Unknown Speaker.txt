them in a mighty way and be with them and may the presence of the lord be real in in their home today as a word goes forth we want to turn to genesis chapter 18 we're going to read from the first verse and i asked that you know you just give me your undivided attention today and uh pull just as hard as you can amen enter in with everything you have amen receive something from the lord make make sure you make the lord welcome today make his word welcome in your life genesis 18 verse 1 and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my lord if i now have found favor and thy sight past not away i pray thee from thy servant let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourself under the tree and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that you shall pass on for therefore are you come to your servant and they said so do as thou has said and abraham hastened to the tent unto sarah and said make it ready quickly three measures of fine meal needed and make cakes upon the earth the heart and um uh abraham ran to the herd and fetched a calf tender in good and gave it unto a young man and he hastened to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat then turn with me to joel chapter one we're going to read from the fourth verse there joel chapter 1 verse 4 that which the palmer worm hath left at the locust eaten and that which the locust has left uh have the cankerworm eaten and that which the canker worm had left at the caterpillar eating and then joel 2 verse 23. be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately he shall come cause to come down for you the rain and the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat and fats shall be shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten and the canker worm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that had dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed you shall know that i'm in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it should come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit and i will show wonders in the heavens and the earth and blood and fire and pillars of smoke and the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered for in mount zion and in jerusalem shall be deliverance as the lord has said and in the remnant whom the lord shall call amen may god bless you can be seated we're going to be speaking this morning about under the oak tree and of course um as we think about even our own environment and the weather here of late ah it's been hot and dry out there we just come through a time of drought and you know high heat and these recent showers have been certainly refreshing we want to thank the lord for that a little break in the weather i read the sign on the church coming down this way last month and said that louisiana is hot but hell is a lot hotter and for the world as for the world she is being prepared for the burning if you notice here that disappearing happened with abraham in the heat of the day and we're here in the heat of the day where we're already seeing signs of the last plague being poured out into the air the fullness of that will be in the tribulations but already the temperature has changed and the atmosphere is charged with evil you can hardly breathe sodom has you know sodom was a hot place the fires of sin was flaming throughout it wasn't getting any better it was getting worse and worse the tensions today and modern sodom and gomorrah are also flaming hot the gospel is all but dried up in our nation and the land is tender dry ready for the burning the fires of plagues are red-hot and riots are in our streets and women are screaming for the rights to kill their babies and these are wicked these are very wicked spirits from hell and there are there are heated debates of of politics and you know raiding the former president's home and a crisis at the border as an invasion takes place and the increase of homelessness the spirit of lawlessness everywhere there's looting and rioting and trashing our cities it is hot as hell out there the russian bear is whipping its cubs and um china is snarling at the world and america is going bankrupt and inflation is rampant with with our life savings just disappearing and here in america even we have 87 000 new irs agents that are now being hired to hunt out and sniff down everything that they can to bring about persecution you don't think so brother branham saw it himself he said i i had a vision of a great hideously dark smoky scaly like an alligator man come moving toward me with iron fingers and i had one little knife like that and he had on him united states government and he identified that as the irs that was coming after him to that they had weaponized to try to keep him from going overseas into south africa put limits on his v on his visa and his passport and keeping the gospel out of foreign nations and you know doing everything they could to hamper unjustly hamper the gospel of jesus christ and and of course they've already weaponized the irs and have went after the tea party conservatives and this army will be used in a greater way in the tribulation to force the mark of the beast so it's hot out there we're living in a day it's the heat of the day it's where where the the fires of hell and the winds of hell and the smoke from that other dimension is permeating the society that we're living in and things aren't getting better they're getting worse and i thought of something that brother branham a prayer that he prayed in the is there anything too hard for the lord he said heavenly father your god the everlasting god and i'm quoting your only your own beloved son's word he said as it was down that that day in sodom just before the fire fell from heaven and destroyed the city so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now father we we see yonder hanging in the hangars automatic uh atomic bombs setting out on islands and atomic bombs hydrogen bombs at blow a hole in the ground 150 feet deep for 100 miles square and thousands of those pointed to each nation submarines warming their way around under the water earthquakes in diverse places flying saucers in the air fearful sights in the heavens above and men's hearts failing for fear perplex of time and distress among the nations and he says oh god then here you come moving on the scene with the holy spirit pulling into the church bringing up the days of sodom and we see the sodomite spirit women on the street and the churches dressing it morally wearing all kinds of filthy immoral dress clothes to tempt the man on the streets and evil spirits on them and don't know it and find women sending their souls to hell and we'll have to answer at the day of judgment for committing adultery does she be pure as the lily physically but throwed herself before men and whosoever looked at them on a woman to lust after has committed adultery with her already in his heart and the woman not knowing that her dressing like that and the man looking at her she'll have to answer for committing adultery before she permitted herself to be dressed like that and set before men to tempt him god look at the nation lord look at the church how it swallowed that stuff up just as satan just so easy and and satan has fed them this little this corruption of hell and and many thousands have believed it oh come lord jesus come lord you said if the work wasn't cut short there'd be no flesh saved truly lord we see that in our self today we see the fallen away and the cooling off and many may the remnant that escapes out of this babylon may it rise and shine may you fill it with the power of god the holy spirit come upon it lord perform the great works of god and pull that which is ordained to eternal life back into the fold again grant it lord grant it and hear our prayers so it's hot out there the atmosphere is ripe for the burning down in the sodom world the men of sodom would riot to get a chance to molest or desecrate angels or anything that was sacred or holy but you see that's the world but here abraham was dwelling under a tree and that tree was a place of refreshing amen he was there experiencing the an appearing of the angels one of which is the lord himself while the world is tender box dry no revival in the winds are winds of strife that are making things even hotter who would ever thought that jesus would come back to the earth in an evil day like this who would ever thought that he would pick a day like this to come to get a bride amen they they have said it can't happen when the with the winds of from hell this hot but no matter how hot it was no matter how evil day no matter though it was a day of sodom and gomorrah a time where sin reached to the heavens god was still appearing and he was appearing to his elect abraham and to his seed amen and abraham invited them to rest themselves under the tree and he prepared food for them the bible said he stood by the under the by them under the tree and they did eat he welcomed them to come and sit down under my tree and and let me entertain you just for a little while let me make you feel welcome let me wash your feet let me prepare a meal for you let's have some communion together amen oh it's hot outside but here's a place of refreshing there's a place that you can come that the lord is welcome in an age where he's the unwelcome christ among churches where he's the unwanted christ there is a place where the abrahams the elect seed they mended out that are dwelling under an oak that are inviting his presence that are seeing him appear that are entertaining angels that are having a visitation that the spirit of the lord is moving among them and the winds of the holy spirit is blowing through their tree and their shade there is providing a welcome place and an atmosphere for angels to come hallelujah it's so important that there is a place of refreshing where the spirit of god is welcome a place where angels can appear and be entertained and i thought of it last week as i preached on uh a prophetic class of people and how the holy spirit is the prophet that is here among us and there's a prophetic class of people that he's appearing to and to show that we're a prophetic class of people the book of joel said in the restoration old men would would drink dreams and young men would see visions and i will pour out my spirit upon this prophetic class and i'll open their eyes to what's going on and let them see clearly their day and their hour so they can recognize it and walk in it amen it's so important to be a place or to have a place and for the church to be a place of refreshing where the spirit of god is wanted and welcomed and entertained and he visits a place where angels can appear be careful to entertain angels the bible said amen it's so important today that we are here not to be entertained but to welcome him and entertain him now you know brother branham actually lacking some ministers to oak trees they have been through the storms they have defeated and cast out devils they are contenders for the faith that was once delivered to the saints i wouldn't want to sit under a pastor that didn't have a walk with god that knew nothing but psychology and don't know how to cast the devil out amen you know there's many places that haven't seen a move of god for years and years where the ministry is dried up on a vine where it's a dry place where the spirit of god maybe once was there but is no longer there it is a sad place i wouldn't want to sit under that kind of a ministry that don't know how to cast satan out he said uh he pointed brother osborne to brother bosworth and said brother bosworth he said there there's an old oak tree sitting over there on my porch i was referring to brother bosworth i said who knows about divine healing crawl up under that tree and talk to him a little life so you see that's that's the way it is some ministers are oak trees they have been through the storms now some ministry they may have been through the storm and they're old but they're just on snags the life of god had moved there and used them for years and years and years and there's no fruit to their ministry but i'll just say this about our church that evening like tabernacle be one of those oak trees amount of oak trees with restored branches not stripped and wormied in the dead not withered leaves and bearing limbs that can't give shave why why should a church be like an old burn over forest that groaned in the wind when the winds of heaven blew and it can't wave its branches and glorify god in restoration of the bride tree brother adam said that god was speaking here of his fruit tree and joy that we have read and he said god planted a fruit tree he planted it on the day of pentecost and he brought forth a tree there for a purpose he wanted it to bear his fruit word god's word he wanted a church that would keep his word all down to the age eve failed to keep it and the jews had failed to keep it and the law had failed and all it failed so god planted himself a tree and he said i'm so glad i believe that god planted a holy o seed on the day of pentecost that hybrid it into denomination but after a while it got back to its original again back to the real holy ghost back to the gospel message back to acts 2 again back to the formula back to where it began at because this is his promise i will restore remember this god expects fruit he expects fruit out of out of your life out of this church out of this ministry or any ministry god expects fruit and when he found no fruit jesus cursed a fig tree because he had no fruit another parable was of a fig tree that wasn't barren and the owner of the field said cut it down and and and you remember the the caretaker said but just let me dunk it and you know dig around it and dunk it and fertilize it there and and see if it'll bring forth fruit and if it won't cut it down and that's exactly what god's done in this day he's taken and he's he has he has fertilized this bright tree he's fertilized the trees of the garden he's fertilizing your tree and if you won't bear his fruit you'll be cut down that's all there is to it you'll be left behind you're burned up in the sodom burnin now this gift this tree rider that god planted it was to bear nine different kinds of fruit think of that nine different kind which means nine different gifts nine fruits of the spirit to go with those nine spiritual gifts that was god's spiritual tree he planted it on the day of pentecost now notice now what taken place god planted a tree to bring forth spiritual gifts gifts of a spirit the same spirit that was in christ came down upon his church and it was growing and bearing forth fruit everywhere they didn't think of themselves they didn't organize anything they just went ahead and they were brothers and god planted this tree remember to bear spiritual fruit fruits of his spirit is that right amen but what did man do man has tried to take the spiritual church and make it into an artificial form so you see luther had a spiritual church but happened what happened as soon as luther died they made it into a form an artificial same thing with wesley same thing with the pentecostal move same thing that is happening with many churches and and moves across the message they they make an an artificial put on good works you know all maybe sometimes great congregations or smart people or celebrity of the city or it looks good on the outside but it never bears any of the christ-like fruits brother branham told us there in the second seal he said what did the nickel age nicoletan age ask for it asked to get away from them bunch of people that shouts and claps their hand let the services be a dead dump just let it be you know the people just sit and try their best to absorb it don't don't let there be a move of the spirit don't let there be the hallelujahs and the amens and people entering in and people rejoicing and making him welcome don't you know when you say amen to the word you are making him welcome don't you know when you raise your hands almighty god you are making him welcome don't you know that when you sing our praises from your heart you are making him welcome god wants a people that makes him welcome that welcomes his holy spirit that's invites them come move on me come shake my branches come cause me lord to wave in your presence i'm meant to worship you with all of my heart you see you see they ask to get away from that bunch of people that shouts and claps your hands and looks disgracefully like they did on the day of pentecost act like drunk men staggered in the spirit and thing they didn't want none of that stuff you see they said they were drunk and when the celebrity don't miss this might sound crazy to you but it's the truth when the dignitaries began to come in they couldn't stoop to that i wonder how many times we have tried to dignify the message to where we we don't want none of them shouting tongues speaking acts 2 38 youngins we try to dignify it you know where where we we got to wear a certain kind of clothes and dress up a certain way and make that make those who who are not as wealthy as the others feel inferior you know again we we we do all kinds of things that is happen even within the framework of the message as it becomes denominational minded it becomes a little group of us for and no more so they become closed shut in afraid to let the gospel out that's why they're preaching against the internet is because they don't want the gospel to go into all the world they don't realize it's a way of breaking barriers they don't realize it's a way that it can go beyond the the bamboo curtain and get into areas there that couldn't come into a service like this but they can they can see it right there in their home and you can be an oak tree where that another believer over in china can get a refreshing from the presence of god where it's over in japan they can be ministered to whether it's down in africa they can be ministered to down in kuwait and muslim countries and down into egypt and down even into israel all around across the world that they can do it fulfilling the scripture that the gospel is to go into all nations [Applause] amen y'all tell you what you say i'm against the internet brother tim i tell you bring me a quote against it you don't have one then you got to shut up about it we don't want the gospel out there the gospel's got to go it's got to go to all the world so the end can come you see but they but again what happens when men become closed up they become sticky in a cactus and everything's just poking everybody else because of the heat of the day they are affected by it and become little bitty clustered groups i'll tell you what if you're that little bitty clustered group you got responsibility by yourself to preach the gospel to the whole world you got a huge job on your hand brother we're not we're not alone in this god's got to bride around the world amen and it's going out to all the world it's not us foreign no more it's not about us and a little kingdom building bringing a dried up branch somewhere now listen if the appearance of elohim comes when the world is hot and in a dry condition with blistering heat god's going to need a tree amen somewhere that will welcome him somebody that will make him welcome when he comes are you with me and the bible said and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat you see there's a lot about trees in the bible churches are trees the bride is a tree the groom is a tree and my righteous people are trees are you with me man god is like a tree for he's a tree of life man is like a tree but let me tell you what these trees do verse chronicles 16 33 then shall the trees of the woods sing out in the presence of the lord amen so this is what the trees do they sing out in his presence they worship in his presence psalms 196 12 let the field be joyful and all that is therein then shall all of the trees of the wood rejoice before the lord for he cometh for he cometh to judge the earth and he shall judge the earth with righteousness and his people with truth how many believes he's brought his truth how many believe it's a righteous truth amen so he has come bringing truth and when he does the trees sing out in the presence of the lord hallelujah will you see the word doesn't come without worship when the word comes what happens the trees sing [Applause] now the groom is likened to the tree let's go to some song of solomon chapter 2 and verse 3 as the apple trees among the trees of the wood so is my beloved among the suns i sat down on his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste think of that here it is the apple tree my beloved is like an apple tree i sat down under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste so the bridegroom is also a tree a fruit tree amen given fruit to re refresh the bride now turn around over to the song of solomon chapter 4 and verse 12 and we'll see where the bride is likened to a tree in fact he said that a garden enclosed is my sister it's not just one tree he was one tree is that right amen he was the original tree but you see the church is a multi-member body it's a garden amen are you with me god's got a people around the world god's got a people a man and everyone even a church is a garden and each one of you is a fruit tree amen amen every minister is a tree every every individual is a tree for what for you to entertain angels for you to show some brotherly kindness for you to have a little tender mercies with for you to be able to commune together and have fellowship together with a whole church ought to be an oak tree so my garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring set up a fountain seal that plants are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits and camphor with sphagnum and spagnu and saffron and calamus and cinnamon with all the trees of frankincense myrrh and lowe's with all the chief spices my goodness you know it's just a variety because god is not a harmony house sears and robot catalog and man he's a god of variety amen everybody doesn't look alike but everyone has something to bring everyone has something to contribute they're all imported in the garden one's a pomegranate a man which comes out the sweet fruit and with healthy vitamins and there's others that are are um the pleasant fruits with spikenard or camphor or saffron or calamus or cinnamon and all the trees of frankincense and myrrh and love with the chief spices they are you know the churches of spicy church amen some of them give a little bit of a spicy taste maybe that little hot in their personality but we need some them them are real sweet in their personality but we need them some of them just give out a good smell but we need them and the whole thing makes a garden for god to come and dwell in and walk among his garden and feel welcome there's something soothing about it i like to go into my garden my my spouse my sister is a garden hallelujah amen oh brother tim well you know you you just want to push this one out and push up we don't want to push nobody out we need every tree we need everyone but we need you to be fruitful well man we need you to be a contributor we need you to be more than a spectator we need you to be a participator amen come on church that's exactly right that's what we need we need everybody working together in the garden making a welcome place for god and his children amen i had a man the other day called me and he he he said he was a pentecostal and he did an anonymous call and i answered it and i didn't know who i was talking to met some of you sisters in a in a store somewhere and got my number from them and one of the calls said i you know one wouldn't know about this church and how many are you oh two three hundred well in churches like that you know i'm sure you got lots of clicks among you and i and i said clicks he said yeah said most of churches like that you know there's got a lot of people you know they don't they don't fellowship i like little groups i like little little churches because there's no clicks there don't don't kid yourself don't kid yourself amen you know let me just say something to you for a moment jesus had an inner circle of 12. he had an outer circle of 70 and then there was another outer circle of men and women that followed him yes sir hey man you know you don't like that you know in heaven god is a god of orders he's a god that has archangels and seraphims and cherubims they don't all do the same job and now they are all of a different order amen amen so you say but brother tim people get cliquish and i said well i said okay i said um so let me ask you something about yourself and these quickest churches they went that you've been to i said when's the last time you invited everybody at your house when's the last time that you hosted the church i said i do have a question for you though can you accommodate 300 people at your home no i can't i said most other people can't either so somebody gets left out don't they i said but if you wanted friends you ought to show yourself friendly amen amen you can decide yourself i just want to get lost in in the in the midst of them and never never have any fellowship and fall through the cracks or you can get in there and come apart you can help out of the wedding hey you can start by just attending weddings where you're invited hey man you can help out at a funeral i mean you can comfort those that are mourning you can provide food for those that are needy amen sometimes you just need to show up for a funeral show that you care you want somebody to care for you come on you need to care for other people and it starts by you showing care coming out of yourself and letting other people know i want fellowship amen so if you want fellowship start running out to meet the angels amen your fellow brothers and sisters and invite them under your tree oh you don't like that kind of preaching do you but if you're going to be a real oak you've got to be able to do that amen you know it don't just work one way you've got to show yourself friendly you gotta you gotta be the entertainment abraham didn't wait to be entertained well them three angels are quickest you know there's three of them and one of me and they're clickers and they don't want me no he ran to meet them amen you see again you've got to do the same thing you've got to show a care you got to show a love you got to show i am an oak tree and i've got enough shade for other people to come i am a contributor amen now i want you to understand the you know this real clear the bride of christ the bride of christ is a tree a garden with trees it's lush it's fragrant it's welcoming amen it's inviting it has an atmosphere you see the blossoms you smell the perfume you enjoy the fragrance that's what a church is but that's what you are come on now amen a church is made up of individuals everyone's a cell in the body everyone makes a contribution we work together when we come to church it ain't just a song leader leading the songs or just the prayer of the man leading the prayer leading the prayers no it's you praying it's you singing it's you contributing it's you clapping your hands it's you raising your hands it's you making him welcome come to my tree lord don't pass me by amen here don't you see my branches amen i've got a shade for you lord i've got a place it's not sodom it's not hot under here it's cool it's refreshing come by my way speak to my heart amen give me of your word show me of your promises amen now you see i also want you to see when the word returns and the doctrine falls it is the rain given seed to the sower and bread to the eater and it brings revival as the mountains and the hills break forth into singing and the trees clap their hands read with me in isaiah 55 and verse 10 isaiah 55 and verse 10. for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but water the earth and maketh it bring forth in blood that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth what's now words going forth out of my mouth prophets prophesying seeing vision dreaming dreams the word is spoken amen it's it's professed it's proclaimed it's confessed are you with me it shall not return and to be void but it shall accomplish what i please it's a prospering the thing that i sent it to and for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace and the mountains and the hills shall break forth unto you unto singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands are you hearing me when the word comes what happened to trees in the field clap your hand and the mountains and the hills break forth under singing and instead of the throne oh my oh my instead of the thorn instead of scoffing instead of sitting there like a bump on a log instead of sitting there as a sour pickle somebody help me preach instead of a thorn that should come up a fir tree a useful tree and instead of the briar that shall come up the merle tree and it shall be for the lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off amen in this day of intense heat we're completing the scripture that jesus opened and said this day this scripture is fulfilled because it applies to the bride coming of christ everybody should know where i'm going to isaiah 61 and verse 1 and again the spirit of the lord is upon me because the lord hath anointed me oh what a sweet anointing amen to preach good tidings to the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives to the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god and to comfort all that mourn to point to them that mourn in zion those that are signed and crying it's hot out there in sodom amen all the sin that it's being done in the city amen to point to them that's that mourns signing crying in zion to give to them beauty for isis the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they may be called the trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified hallelujah hallelujah amen that they might be called the trees of righteousness the planting of the lord we're going to we're going to emphasize on that in a little bit the planting of the lord now abraham fed him under the tree now why should a church be like an old burnover forest that groans in the wind when the winds of the spirit blows and it can't waves its branches and glorify god now david saw this tree a long time ago and in his writing of his psalms he you know expressing his joy he he saw this tree and he said it's planted by the rivers of water will you turn with me to psalms 1-1 and let's read this together blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly he not with locke's group down in sodom nor does he stand in the way of sinners nor does he sit in the seat of this carnful come on but his delight is in the law that we're the lord and in his law in his word that he meditate day and night and he shall be what like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth voice what his fruit in his season his leave also shall not wither and whatsoever he do it shall prosper hallelujah amen now here's what david said of a man and he said he's planted by the rivers of water he bringeth forth his fruit and a season he was not just seeing a man he would see in a church amen the water represents the spirit and it's singular notice there he shall be like it's replanted by the rivers of water one water one holy spirit no not waters a methodist or baptist or lutheran or perusian or seven thunder or two soul a none of these denominations are you with me but one spirit one spirit just rivers of one water nine spiritual gifts by the same spirit notice that rivers of one water so this water comes out around this tree with nine different spiritual gifts flowing around it to keep it fruitful because god wants fruit-bearing church god wants you to be fruit-bearing he should be like a tree planted by the rivers of water and a man that's planted by the rivers of water notice one water one spirit but they're around it and that spirit breaks out into different streams of of mercy of healing another stream of mercy by the same spirit prophecy another by the same spirit tongues interpretation discernment of spirits word of knowledge faith working on miracles one giver or one spirit but nine spiritual gifts amen if you don't believe it go listen to the restoration of the bride tree that's exactly the way brother branham placed it amen he said this tree would be planted am i not just stuck out but then planted not an accidental growth but a predestinated place i'm placing the tree in the spirit and there's gonna be nine streams of that spirit and there'll be nine spiritual gifts and it will flow around that tree so it'll bring forth its fruit and it's seasons notice this water this tree with a spirit nine streams of grace poured out his gifts gives the tree its vitality makes it a fruitful tree so what right has any man to withhold or block the streams of the holy ghost a tree without water will not produce fruit and it will have withered leaves and how can a tree with withered leaves produce the fruits of the spirit or how can it provide shade for the almighty to come and rest under can you imagine the almighty coming down and the oak tree all the leaves are withered and the heat's coming through it's not keeping away the atmospheres of evil come on somebody amen it's hot and how are we going to bear fruit without the water of the spirit with his streams of nine spiritual gifts the fruit becomes withered and naughty and worm eden and the church becomes worldly and the members relax in their spiritual life and the first thing you know instead of being a big shady tree it becomes a snag it becomes a place where buzzards roost it becomes the haunt of every unclean and hateful bird that's right you ever see you ever drive by where do you see the buzzards on an old snag big old tree up there with with limbs no leaves on it no refreshing there and the buzzard's sitting right out there all camped that's where buzzards roost amen buzzards are roofs where churches have dried up no longer fruitful don't have any leaves on it there's no worship the sap line has been cut off the lifeline is gone are you with me amen an unclean spirit's right to sit right under that tree adulteries married three and four times and rebellious young people and pregnant teens and fighting moms and dad and fault-finding high-tempered you try to get them to worship and they stop out of the building you know they cast their fruit love isn't there joy is gone peace is replaced with unrest and the unbeliever looks at that and said well there's no difference between that person and me and and the children say if that's what religion does for mom and dad i don't want no part of it are you with me amen because you see what happens they they become just a snag and a haunt for every kind of evil spirit that's not the bride of christ that's not the way we should be amen come on church we need to be a fruitful branch amen amen a shade tree full of leaves happiness joy peace i mean your homes need to be a kind of place where children can come in out of sodom there in the sodom heed and sit down there and refresh it's hot out there homer thank god for my home thank god for praying mom and dad thank god a father can come home after a day's work and sit down under a shade tree oh thank you lord for the good wife for loving mother for uh for doting wife i remember caring for a caring shade tree i can sit here in this home and it's welcoming your holy spirit is welcome when we say the grace around the table is not just to form but we feel your spirit come down we're just moved by the holy ghost what happens churches become a snag they become just an old snag the leaves is gone the bark's been gone a long time it's worm eaten the ball the branches are falling all around the cast of fruit love isn't there joy is gone peace is replaced with unrest and the unbelievers say there's no difference well you know what does the world when they do when they do their polls out there about about christian what have they discovered that there's no difference between the church and the unchurched and then a lot of times you have your kids raised in that environment because why you you know as a cactus you just don't do well under a you know in a garden that's lost and green and growing and moisture and winds of the spirit and refreshing no cactus likes it out there where it's dry do you ever try to get shade under a cacti did you ever go and try to rest under its lofty lofty branches it may have branches out there but you ever try to get up under it and rest and get shade under cactus you don't work many of them are jumping cactus and man they're they're going to be jumping all over you and sticky here and sticky there and sticky there fight vault finding here and find it there and you know well i i don't like it here oh no and first thing you know you the cactus is removed from the garden well there is a different way that you don't have to be removed from the garden because the devil will move you right out of this church if you can but i tell you you don't have to remain a cactus you can be changed in his presence brother branham said a cactus is what the you know this is it's it's leaf is just so so twisted up it becomes a thorn and people there they get that way when they get dry and then they get fault findings well the preacher preaches too long and this ain't to my case and they do this there and i don't like there and first thing you know you don't fit nowhere but an old desert somewhere where it's hot now brother branham preached many times on the subject i will restore many times and just before the church ages in the seals he preaches on the palm arm locust cankerworm caterpillar in his home church a month later he will preach on planting the vine and where to plant it and i'd like you to turn with me to psalms 80 and verse 8 because this is where that he took his sermon sermon um from his context from when he preached on planting the vine and word of planet thou has brought a vine out of egypt thou has cast out the heathen and planted it thou has prepared room before it and it caused it to take deep root and it filled the land you see israel was a vine that could never be fruitful until it was brought back into his promised land of inheritance until then it just produced the naughty bitter fruit of slavery are you with me amen they were a good vibe they were god's chosen amen but the good vine if it isn't set in good ground it'll not bring forth good fruit and i'm just going to say this god may have started you out in good ground but something removed you to egypt are you with me but god is bringing the people out of egypt and planting them in the right ground amen they were a good vine they were god's chosen but a good vine that isn't set on good ground it'll not bring forth its fruits it depends on where the vine is planted will determine the results of the crop so god picks israel up out of a barren land and he plants them into a land of promise what was he doing he was preparing them all of that was preparing for the appearing of the messiah where the word would become flesh and why has he brought us to this land so we could grow up to be a tree where the spirit of god was welcomed amen now you're gonna have to make up for those that ain't here yes sir i can't hear them say amen hallelujah second brother so you're gonna have to make up for him amen amen brother tim hallelujah brother tim do it brother tim seek him to brother tim you got a job to do you're not a spectator that's not why you're here you're not respecting you are here to participate all the way from the front room to the back of the vaseline mean you are to participate in worship now so again he planted them in a promise the land of promise prepared him to avoid the messiah and why has he brought us to this land so that we could grow up to be a tree where the spirit of god would be welcomed hallelujah amen where he could appear and be repressed and welcome and fed and commune there and god called you to be a leaf on that tree come on now don't fall of it let the wind blow you away hang on to the tree it's your life stay in the lifeline don't let your tree let your your leaf just wither away and you just flop off and and blow any old kind of direction amen some people have been that way for years and years and years they can never find their place but god wants a people who knows their god who does exploit who knows their place and their position some of you have been out for 20 years and you're back again why is it god wouldn't let you stay out there he wants you united to the tree amen because under that tree is appearing and where the appearing takes place the body change takes place the rapture will take place the promised sun will come so get under the tree be apart so now the church was the same way you know that we could never prosper it would remain dwarfed and stumbled planted in the soured soils of egypt where the days of miracles are passed listen what i'm saying every one of you some of you were catholic you never brought forth fruit there some of you were methodists some of you were pentecostal some of you were this some of you were nothing but your ground where you were in was soured you were a good seed you were predestinated you were called to this message amen but god said i'm going to take a tree out of egypt and i'm going to plant them in a good land hallelujah otherwise you remain dwarfed it says like david said in the psalms blessed is the man that won't join up with these scoffers and ungodly people you know you know that won't connect with them that won't see sit in the seat with them can you imagine can you imagine we we have a church and we have a body of believers here and you fail to just you know you become a in the seed of this cornfield instead of the seed of rejoicing you know brother brad i'm in the message how can i overcome he said there was an old log he said here's where i got my sermon from there was an old log it was a beach log and he said it had fallen and fallen right into the stream where the life was and he said there in that stream it rotted twice as quick and he said i stepped on it and a big chunk of it fell off and he said that's what's happening to many christians they're right in the stream where the life is going forth but they're rottening twice as quick you're not overcoming are you with me amen god brings you to to sit on the log but it's to be a living law and brother branham said i'll sit right here on this stuff and i'll proclaim i shall restore saith the lord so you may be sitting on a log but you've got to realize this is what god does he wants you to be restored not become dead and become rotten and fall out and go through the same bitter cycle over and over and over again amen now scoffers that say the days of miracles are past the baptism of the holy ghost is just make belief blessed is the man that won't do that blessed is the man that won't stand that'll stand forth for such a thing they don't want to mix those together you can't mix those things together blessed is a man who won't assemble himself under those things that denies the power of the lord the bible said come out from among such for the day will come where they'll be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away blessed is the man that will not assemble himself with these golfers making fun calling the true church a bunch of fanatics he shall be like a tree that is planted by the rivers of water god has put him in a choice spot his fruit shall not wither he shall bring forth his leaves and his fruit in his season watch how david wondered that this man is blessed he will be planted not just set out you know i i see uh i like to see anything planted and either israel in egypt was not planted they were just set out it wasn't their original home ground in a man that's a christian that rests his eternal dona destination upon some denominational creed he's not in his right place he was born to be free amen but he's under a creed and he can't bring forth his fruits he was born to be a child of god and the worship god and something sent him to longing to do it he should be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water rivers uh or water singular real rivers plural many rivers come into one channel in other words he'll be like a man in the scripture that believes all of god's word amen where the power and the nine spiritual gifts can flow through one god into his innermost being people don't believe in shouting the thing of it is they haven't got spiritual joy and the joys of the water of life can flow through and that's a whole lot lots of matter with branham tabernacle it's because the unbelief that cares the worlds has bound the people until it cannot produce spiritual growth and that's what's matter with our nation that's what's a matter with their churches they have no joy and the joy of the lord is departed was written one time in the scripture the hebrew word of ichabod which means the presence of the lord had departed that's over our churches because we left off the original foundation and placed it into a creed and denomination and permitted the things of the world to dry up our experience with god think about that man you know people get on fire they start out with a fervency and a love for god and it isn't long until what happened they get things that drives up their experience a little spirit of criticism comes and it begins to well i don't like the way they did their music and i don't like that one when he sings and i don't like this and you know this preacher ain't up to my power and you know they you know brother tim he preaches too long and this one does this and and and you know on and on and on and that one only screams when he preaches and you know it don't feed me and first thing you know you're a sticker a cactus like i said try to rest under shade he said oh go with me to arizona let me take you to the desert which i roamed so many years and everything in the desert has a sticker any little plant you come to don't get near it it'll stick you it's always got its stickers right out ready to stick anything that comes near it what's the matter what made it a sticker is because it had no water that's what dried it up that sticker is a leaf rolled up for the lack of water it becomes a sticker and this it is with the churches that when the church gets away from the fountain of life when it gets away from the joys of salvation when it gets away from the lord god then that person becomes a sticker finding fault sticking no sooner you come up i'm precipitation and i'm methodist i'm so-and-so don't talk to me about that stuff a sticker it has no fruit you take that same plant the cactus and you put it in the land for a few generations where there's plenty of water and that sticker will unfold and will become a soft leaf bearing fruit now i don't know if that's so true in the natural but it's your true in the spiritual amen so he said what's the matter with the church today it's been set into a denomination that has put denominational creeds and and binds it no joy just a sprinkle now and then of a little revival to hold it what it needs is to come out from among scoffers and unbelievers and be planted by the rivers of waters for there is a fountain filled with blood flowing from emmanuel's veins where sinners and unbelievers plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty states a tree david said planet buy the rivers of water oh god cannot flow himself through a cactus now water represents life we know moses in the wilderness smoke the rock gave forth waters of life to pearson people jesus said as the moses smoked a rock in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up and he was smitten now however this tree according to joel gets eaten down by four different stages of one insect and this corresponds with the four horse riders of revelation and it was the same antichrist spirit that rose up starting out with a white horse and then bloodied in persecution and become red and then blackened in the dark ages and became black and the last stage a pale grizzled color combination of red white and black but irregardless of what kind of insects there has been god has said i will restore and that is the theme of this message that is the ministry of elijah that's what he was sent to do turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse if it's not restored it is cursed i'll send you a light to the prophet to restore the original faith and if they refuse to be restored back to the book of acts of pentecost i'll smite the earth with a curse and fire will fall as sodom burns with an oven are you with me this is this is the consequences of not accepting the restoration amen so well i've accepted elijah but if you hadn't how your heart isn't turned back to believing again back to faith again a restoration taking place then you're smitten with a curse there's going to be a lot of cursed children because why they did not they were not restored are you with me amen now uniting time inside brother brethren said what he say in malachi 4 would restore restore back the original pentecostal faith back to the same people with the same pentecostal message the same pentecostal sign the same pentecostal evidence the same god the same power the same teaching everything exactly with the vindication of the same pillar of fire that struck paul down on the road down to damascus among us today doing the same things he did in that day again and turn on the light if it's a bright tree jesus was the bridegroom he was a tree they cut him down he was a tree of life that was in the garden of eden they cut him down hung him on a roman tree to make fun of him what did he do god raised him up the third day from the dead and today there's a bride tree that started back there at the beginning way back in the day of pentecost amen listen you people that belong to church the church never started in nazir rome it started in jerusalem on the day of pentecost started the church then what did they do they just kept organizing god keeps cutting off the branches they're organized solution and cut off the branches wesley cut off the branches pentecost cut off the branches god is gonna have a bride tree and i'm just saying don't get cut off come on god's going to have a bright tree all that the cankerworm ate and the caterpillar 8 i will restore hallelujah i will restore saith the lord amen brother bill can't you glad god's a restorer amen that he can take you out of unfruitful land and place you in a fruitful land and make you a fruit tree again aren't you glad that god doesn't give up on you hallelujah aren't you glad that god cares about you and your situation and he won't leave you where he found you but he said this time i'm gonna fertilize you i'm gonna dig around you and you're gonna pray for fruit brother branham said but god's going to have a bright tree and that cake of worm all that he ate and the caterpillar ate i will restore us say the lord malachi 4 tells us we'll be brought back to the original faith like it was on the day of pentecost the faith of the fathers we believe that will come i believe it's time for it now amen and the lid the limbs are withered and dried up and they're taking them from the tree so that the fruit can bear itself right at the top of the tree hallelujah so jesus is coming but he's looking at your tree looking for fruit and you either let god restore you or your curse now listen satan's doing everything he can to destroy the bride tree satan has tried over and over again to destroy god's fruit tree but though it might be eaten down to a gnarled stump satan cannot destroy it let me just reassure you satan cannot destroy it though you were nadine down to a gnarled stump satan could not destroy you amen why it's predestinated amen and there is predestinated fruit and there is an elect church in the last day and she is predestinated to be there without spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such things and the worms might have eaten it down but it can't die and that's what brother branham would say i'm standing here on this jump and saying it's going to live there will be a bride tree in the last day that will bring forth the fruit it's always been that way satan's always tried to destroy the tree cain cut down the righteous tree of abel but it came back with seth the children of cain like bugs eight or eight at the sons of god married the daughters of men with them and god took noah through the flood and three branches come up to replenish the earth then jesus was the bride tree the bridegroom tree the restoration of the bride tree let me just share with you these quotes he was god's perfect prophet tree example tree the bridegroom tree from the garden of eden then the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit so he's got to have a bright tree that's the way adam was without without eve he could never bring forth is that right amen so you same thing with christ he's the bridegroom tree he's the pollinator but he's got to have a bride tree to bring his life through amen and she's got to be born of the same material the same species that he is amen the word made flesh in the tree amen oh hope you get that it's the same life in this female tree amen as it was in the bridegroom the same life that was in the bridegroom isn't the bride because they're the same species and together christ and his bride in his garden produces sons oh my now so he said the works that i do shall you do also what's in the groom is also going to be in the bride amen so he says i am the vine and you are the branches i am the source and you're the one going to bring forth the fruit amen so you're the branches you bear the fruit and the male and the female tree produces the pollen one to the other brings the fruit and the branch of the vine does the same thing the first tree was a prophetry a perfect tree the god of the prophets he was the major tree he was god's perfect prophet proper prophet tree why he was the word now the others were minor prophets the word came to the prophets but he was the word himself in the form of a prophet that was the son of man now he was god's prophet tree why he preached all the perfect word of god for he was the word of god made manifest he was the perfect prophet tree that preached the perfect prophet word that brought forth the perfect prophet fruit by the perfect word of god hallelujah amen you talk about a tree amen he was the life tree that adam and eve went away from in the chairman's garden but now the cherubims the angels of god are trying to get you back to be in a tree again [Applause] hallelujah pulling back to human beings so they can eat of that tree so the perfect prophet tree preaching perfect prophet word with perfect prophet signs perfect prophet results perfect fruits of the spirit hallelujah this ain't peter piper picked a peck of peppers no this is a perfect prophet tree preaching perfect prophet word with perfect prophet signs perfect prophet results perfect fruits of the spirit and for mockery they hung him on a roman tree amen being god's spiritual perfect tree they hung him on a mammoth tree and they're trying to take god's perfect tree the word and mix it and hang it up on some kind of creed and death in life what makes jesus never did attend a funeral service he would raise the dead death and life he said can't can't stay together they're contrary one to the other he didn't preach any funerals he just raised them up amen you know legion he lived among tombs dead things jesus went to deliver a man who was among the tomb he went to seek and say that which was lost and he said oh tombs that's a good place a good hangout for the devil around a dead place now think about it god likes to hang out under an oak tree with life in it but here the devil likes an old barren snag with no life in it and legion he howled out in the tombs because he said it's a good hangout for the devil around a dead place somebody that's dead and sins and trespasses don't believe in the power of the resurrection lord that's a good hangout for devils and if you want to know truthfully some of these old cold formal churches that's got a form of godliness and denies the power of god are real hang out for the devil that's right a place where they say oh that's all work up that's all mental that's psychology a place that looks over at our youth camp and say oh that's a bunch of huey and a bunch of workup you see dad is an old tomb good hangout for the devils amen because they deny the power of god amen you say brother tim all these young people they're just faking it let me tell you what i would rather see them knocking at the door amen seek it and keep on seeking so what some of them get up from there and they go back to their sin and their pornography and their evil but i would rather see them in church coming down the altar knocking on the door saying god let me in even if they didn't go all the way at least they were knocking [Applause] but you're only looking at half the picture amen there's many of them that knocked and it opened that sought and they found it that house can receive there's many of them today living victorious lives right here in this church there are young people amen who god transformed their lives right there at an old fashioned altar where god changed them in his presence brother branham said a good place where they say it's all work up that's just mental that's just psychology and oh my some of those devils don't make you cut yourself some of them are shrewd and polishes could be they're scholars don't think they're not no you say brother brian i'm no no i'm scripturally then them high priests and those jews in that day that denied jesus christ they were polished bible scholars hallelujah that same religious devil comes down to people today some trying to make fun of the baptism of the holy ghost or speaking with tongues but nevertheless god's going to have a tree and he planted a tree on the day of pentecost so it was established on the day of pentecost where peter preached the inauguration sermon when the church was born and was born on the day of pentecost now god he's infinite he's a and he cannot change his church must remain the same as it was at the beginning you believe that amen said must remain the same so you don't take her with it come on amen you you know you don't change it you don't add to it it never was shaking hands and saying i believe the message it never was except in a theology and say i believe that perusa are the presence or this or that the other that never was it what was it it was a sound from heaven like a russian mighty wind that made men and women come to life amen and they were endued with power from on high so you see every tree must have its beginning at pentecost what the church had in pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word of god she had the power of the spirit then manifested in diverse signs and wonders and gifts of the holy ghost now planted any other place than pentecost will cause it to bear sour fruits but this is brother brandon's prayer he said granite father heal of the sick and afflicted bring them back to an old-fashioned revival type of people bring them back to original pentecost bring them back to the blessings bring them back like the pentecost that fell at 80 33 give them the pentecostal blessings may the power of god come into the church may there be divine healing gifts give to the church may there be speakers with tongues interpreters of tongues may there be gifts of prophecy all different manifestations not make believe or try to believe or put on but real genuine coming with the word and the word of god made known prophesying things that come to pass you said in your word if there be one that's among you with a uh that's supposed to be a prophet if it doesn't come to pass don't hear him but if it does come to pass and hear that prophet because i'm with him god give us that kind of prophets give us the real kind the kind the real kind that speaks with tongues the real kind that has real interpretation granted father heal the sick and afflict and make yourself known among us for we ask it in jesus name amen so this is exactly what he said what he told us that would happen now let's go to psalms chapters 80 and verse 7. let's pick up this i'm going to read it from the niv it's a little little easier here and i but i cause it it says some words that i want you to grasp and verse 7 psalms 80

sea it shoots as far as the river why have you broken down the wall so that all that passed by pickett's grapes now this was israel and he was saying because now they they had been taken down the babylon this is one of those songs that was written of the babylon era where that they had been taken captive boy he said you planted us here but we've been taken down to babylon and the walls are
