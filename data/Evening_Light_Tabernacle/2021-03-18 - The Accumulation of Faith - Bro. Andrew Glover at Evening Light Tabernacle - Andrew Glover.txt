jesus christ that blood can heal that blood can save that blood can deliver it can pardon there's nothing impossible for the blood of jesus christ amen and we're under that blood tonight hallelujah i always say god bless you this evening if you have your bibles while you're standing with us we'll go straight to the word sure thank the lord for the opportunity to be here this evening with you all and i sure appreciate the opportunity to speak to you appreciate brother tim allowing us to come this way and i sure appreciate him and the church here and just coming out of the meetings there in oklahoma this weekend the spirit of the lord moving among us and i tell you we've got some underage drinkers around here tonight amen but it's not that old wine it's the new wine amen and it's still got stimulation of revelation amen it amazes me people get all tore up when people get to dancing and shouting and praising god and they say well that's not what brother branham did that's not in the message and that's not not nice to do now that we believe the message but whatever brother branham had in about 1963 it cost him to almost wake up a neighborhood running down the street under the revelation of this hour and i believe tonight we've got something to shout about we've got something to rejoice about tonight what we're feeding on is going to change our bodies one of these mornings amen amen we're sure sure under expectation of him tonight and just before we read the word let's just buy our hearts together for word of prayer this here this evening and let's just ask the lord to come and speak to us tonight heavenly father lord we are your believing children here tonight and lord we are indeed grateful to be called your children lord we're thankful for the faith that is in our hearts tonight dear god lord to know it's not the faith of a church it's not the faith of a man but lord it's the faith of jesus christ that you promised in these last days that you would send elijah lord to restore the faith of the church lord restore the faith of god into the church lord where it's not denominational faith believe in what denomination limits us to believe but lord it's the faith of abraham it's the faith of god that is lord in our hearts tonight to believe for the impossible or to stand against a mountain and testify this mountain will be removed lord it's the faith to stand there around the walls of jericho and testify that those walls are coming down and lord as we gather here tonight we come to do one thing that is to throw the wood lord of your word upon the fire tonight that the fire would not go out the lord it would just get a little bit hotter it would burn just a little bit more brighter tonight father lord you see those that are here tonight maybe sick and body lord maybe those at home watching by way of internet or wherever they would be lord desiring to be here i pray lord that the angels of god would go and camp around them tonight lord may you minister healing to their bodies lord for those who would be bound may you set them free lord in this meeting tonight may you open the windows of heaven tonight lord and may you pour out your blessings upon this congregation father and whatever is accomplished here tonight will be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers said amen and amen the book of psalms the hundred and second chapter the book of psalms 102 we want to say god bless you this evening we bring greetings from our pastor brother sean martin and all the saints there at home at faith tabernacle sent greetings to you this evening and you're glad to have my wife here with me this this evening with us as well we're just looking forward to what the lord has for us tonight in the word amen in psalms 102 and verse 16 the bible here says when the lord shall build up zion he shall appear in his glory we could say when the lord shall build up his bride he shall appear in his glory i love that word build up when the lord shall build up zion he shall appear in his glory in the book of jude the first chapter jude the first chapter i want to look there in the 17th verse of jude 1. how many thanks to the lord for the reading of the word of god tonight amen jude chapter 1 and verse number 17 the bible here says but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our lord jesus christ how that they told you there should be markers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lust these be they who have separated themselves central having not the spirit but ye beloved i'm glad we're not those other verses we're in this verse but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ and to eternal life and of some have compassion making a difference and others say with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garments spotted by the flesh now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy here's the only one that can do this to the only wise god our savior be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and ever and the church said amen god bless you this evening as you may have your seats there for just a few moments tonight from the from those scriptures i'd like to speak to you if i will title this tonight i want to speak to you on the accumulation of faith the accumulation of faith i truly believe that this is the hour that we have been restored back to not a faith amen but to thee faith and it's the faith of the lord jesus christ and i don't believe that it's a faith that is only going to take us so far but i believe the faith of jesus christ is going to take us all the way some they begin the journey and they only go so far but there are some amen that's ordained of god to go all the way and we realize the time we're living in amen that god is doing some marvelous things in this time we we realize he is saving souls amen he is he is healing the sick he is raising the dead he is casting out devils god is doing so many marvelous things in this time and i'll just say this we are actually blessed to be a part of it we're actually actually blessed tonight to be a part of what god is doing in this age the prophet said what a picture it gives us tonight of the church in the last days you see what man can do and then you see what god does what man does is failing now notice how he says this what man does is failing and will fail and has failed and will always fail but what god does is eternal and must forever remain nothing can ever take it away what man does is failing and it will fail and it has failed fail and it always will fail but what god does is eternal and must forever remain nothing can ever take it away god give it it's his free gift and by sovereign foresight he saw it and placed it and there's nothing can ever move it it's there eternally now think about that what man does amen it has failed it is failing it will fail it will always fail amen but what god does must always and forever remain then to think tonight amen that the devil only has one desire and that is to take away amen what god has done for you if god has saved you he has one desire that is take away your salvation if god has delivered you he has one desire that is to take you back into the bondage that god has delivered you out of if god has healed you he has one desire and that is to take away your healing but the bible says amen heaven and earth shall pass away amen but my word shall not pass away then to think tonight amen that god can do something in the hearts and the lives of individuals amen that no devil can take it away to faint tonight amen that if god saved you he didn't save you today amen to lose you tomorrow if god redeemed you he didn't redeem you today amen to lose you tomorrow whatever god does amen is not failing it will never fail it has never failed it will always remain let me say this we are not built out of stuff that just falls apart amen amen we are not built out of things it just blows away amen at the first trouble we thought up our hands and walk away that's not the material amen that we are built out of we are built out of the same material amen that noah was built out of we are peeled out of the same material that abraham and sarah amen was built out of we are not made amen out of stuff that is temporary we are made out of stuff that is eternal and then that's why tonight i'm preaching to people amen that's been through troubles and they've been through trials and they've been through situations but there's nothing they've been through amen that had more power than what was on the inside of them and then because a man didn't put it in there and then god put it in there and if god put it in there it is not their temporary it is their eternal what man done has failed it is failing and it will always fill but what god does amen is eternal then that's why that we must forget amen about all things amen concerning a man we get in our mind that man's got to be here amen for god to heal a certain man is going to be here for god to say amen it's not a certain man it's jesus christ the same yesterday amen today and forever then tonight if your preacher favorite preacher is not in the building all things are still possible hey amen if your favorite singer is not singing all things are still possible this is not the work of a man this is amen the work of almighty god that's why jude said remember ye the words which were spoken before now the prophet says lord there has already been prayer offered in this place tonight amen the songs of zion have been sung by your children and their hearts have been lifted up and we have come here to consecrate ourselves to the end of worship fee from the depths of our soul and we're calling this to your remembrance lord that you said when you set up on the mount and you taught your disciples you said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled you promised it lord now we are coming tonight amen with open hearts we're coming tonight with open hearts we're coming hungry and thirsting and we know that you'll keep your promise see amen there's not a bunch of open hearts here tonight amen hoping that god will keep his promise amen but there's open hearts here tonight knowing amen that before they ever even gathered this spiel amen that god would not make a promise amen and then gather a group of people around the house of god ain't meant to hear about that promise if he was not god enough to keep that promise amen if he was god enough to keep that promise and then that he's got enough here tonight to fulfill that promise and it don't matter what devil says it's impossible it don't matter what spirit tries to stop it it don't matter what unbelief raises its hand in the midst of believers that knows that this is more than a man there is a sword here tonight ain't been to cut the head off of every unbelieving spirit and say father you promised you would come in our midst and you would give us the desires of our hearts so we know tonight that god he keeps his promises he says as we endeavor to open up these sacred pages of the bible to read from it its contents may the holy spirit just take it to every heart and may that seed fall down into deep rich faith that will bring forth every promise somebody say every promise every promise that the word is made he said hear us lord and cleanse us and try us and if there be any unclean thing about us lord any unconfessed sin anything that's not right reveal it just now lord and we'll walk right straight and do it for we realize we are living in the shadows of the coming of the lord jesus and we have oh holy god coming to thy shadows of the justice tonight and we are pleading for a new dedication he said a consecration and a feeling of the holy spirit in our lives seeing the revival powers begin to dim down amen let us throw on the wood of the word that it might kindle a new fire then our hearts would be full of zeal amen i tell you that's what we need tonight amen it's not a new quote book amen it's not a new idea it's not a new school what we need tonight amen is some wood in the word they meant to fall upon the fire amen and let that power begin to burn he said sanctify us lord through thy precious word and thy blood and thy grace we plead and all thanks and praise will be thine he said give us pure hearts and clean hands and clean minds that we might come in the sanctuary amen night after night rejoicing and be filled with your spirit then i ask you the question tonight amen why do we come to church do we come to see each other do we come just to hear the preacher do we come just to sing a bunch of songs he said people think church is a good place to go oh you go there to learn to be good that isn't it friend no god is god amen the very reason we come to the house of god is because god is god he said now watch amen and if he ever was he's just as great today as he ever was and he always will be the same he said we just love him amen now there's something to think about god is still god and the devil is still the devil amen but if god is still god then his word is still true and his power is still among us amen i'm on the preacher for a second amen i don't think there's any room now ain't been this close to the coming of the lord amen to power need to some spirit i don't think this is the hour they meant to power me to someone some oversetting sin or some habit or some stronghold if god was ever god he still got here tonight that means if he ever set somebody free he's still doing it today if you've ever healed somebody of cancer he's still doing it here today if he ever gave the holy ghost he's still given the holy ghost today there is no limits on my god amen if it's in his word and his word is true and his power is here amen to perform the promise that he wrote in his own word yes sir god is still god and satan is still satan now you'll realize that satan amen we call him a dumb devil and he is amen but let me say this satan is very strategic and he is very deceptive paul will say unless satan should get an advantage of us amen for we are not ignorant of his devices we are not ignorant of his devices that word devices mean mind amen or thoughts or mental perception amen of an evil purpose that which thanks mine thoughts or purposes the problem of god said now we find that this great enemy of god thought now as long as they will believe that word i can never get to them and as long as that little family in eden keeps behind that word i can never touch them neither can he today he's still blocked off he meant the devil knows today he cannot touch god sealed he meant an anointed sons and daughters of god that's right but if i can use some real good strategy and just reason out i give some human reasonings because well she's human if i can just give human reasonings then we'll win the battles satan and his angels he said then eve gave away so therefore we know our enemy by his attacks maybe you didn't get it just right the way i said it we know our enemy when anyone any spirit any person even tries to disagree with god's word remember that's your enemy amen that is your enemy when any spirit amen any person or anything tries to disagree with god's word that's not your friend amen that's not your brother that's not your sister that is your enemy that's his old attack he said the one he broke the human race down with that's the way he breaks it down yet today he said that's the way he gets you away from god is to disbelieve his word and the only way you can ever stay in fellowship with god and talk to him in the cool of the evening is stay fortified in the word he said now let the curtain of god's word amen drop all around you and you'd be a drop right in the middle of it he said then you are fortified amen then one of satan's strategies in the last days is in the time of trouble is to get the people to forget amen that god is still god he doesn't necessarily want you to forget amen the church you go to he doesn't necessarily want you to forget amen your pastor forget amen your favorite preacher forget amen the favorite meaning you've ever been in but the devil wants you to forget amen that god is still god for paul will say in romans 1 28 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over amen to a reprobate mind to do things amen which are not convenient see what a reprobate mind does it forgets how god's word said his love amen would be manifested it forgets how god's word amen said that he would perform amen the promises of his word amen now that's what the devil does is he puts a heaviness upon the church and he'll say the reason why you're going through this is because god has forgot you amen the reason why you're facing this trial amen it's because god has forgot you amen the last thing the devil wants you to do is stand before a mountain and remember that god said amen speak to the mountain and the mountain will be removed and then the last thing the devil wants you to do a minute to seek cancer they've been show up in somebody's body amen and stand there and remember the word of god said let's start praying the prayer of faith amen and the sick shall be healed amen when you're standing there in the hour of crisis and you don't know where to turn to and you don't know who to look to remember the last thing the devil wants you to do is to remember that god said in the time of trouble you will call unto me and i will hear you and i will answer you or y'all hear me tonight if the devil even can get us to forget god's word and get us to get out from behind god's word then the devil has already won the battle the prophet said they look at the love of god as this the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval amen neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved he said his love is elective which he had for us before he been the foundation of the world amen now think about this god loves you amen before the trial you come against that caused you to question god's love for you amen he loved you before the first negative doctor's report you received that the devil tried to get you to use and ask if god really or you hear me tonight amen let's just settle one thing god loves you amen he knows you and he cares for you and there's nothing past there's nothing present there's nothing in the future amen that can separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so amen see what did he say he said so where did he say it in his word and manifested that he did love for us and brought us himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass they've been seething tonight they met in the time of trial that's not the time to quit praising god in the time of trouble that's not the time to quit worshiping the lord if there's ever been a time amen that the church can i preach here for a minute has there ever been a time that the church needs to praise god it's right now amen i know the devil right now is even fighting our young people amen he's trying to tell you and all that emotion this weekend was just a bunch of work up and there was nothing really valued in that amen the devil will get on some old pride methodists around the message and say we don't need shouting we don't need praise of god amen but let me tell you tonight if anybody has got a right to praise god it's somebody amen that god has done something for if anybody's got a right amen to lift up hands and to dance in the spirit and to sound around the walls of jericho it's the pride of jesus christ how can we do it because he loves us amen he loved us before the foundation of the world he knew these trials was coming he knew this age was coming but he knew there would be a pride on the earth that would stand there behind the word and say i refuse amen to forget what he said in his word and when you look in the corinthians the 10th chapter you'll find there paul writing and he's showing you israel's experiences amen as an example for the church which is warning us from hebrew history and you'll notice there that paul taps the life of the wilderness as the christian life in first corinthians 10 verse 1 for over brethren i would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized into moses in the cloud and in the sea and they'd all eat the same spiritual meat and did all bring the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples amen to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted now he says neither ye be idolaters as some of them as it was written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fail in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tip christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happen unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world has come we're for letting thank you standeth take heed lest he fall now the prophet said i do not just come to any meeting just to be seen i don't come there just to say well i to maybe pray the lord give me a message it'll make people feel real good and shout we've had plenty of that he said that's wonderful but what i know is lord you direct my thoughts in something that will help the people that will place them closer to god that'll do something for them that not so much as build them up spiritually but will build them up in the knowledge and the admonition of god so they will know somebody say no so they'll know how to stand when the enemy comes amen it's not good enough just to have a sermon preached to you that makes you feel real good and shout we love that amen but the prophet of god is saying i'm preaching to you amen that you'll have a fear amen an admonition amen a knowledge of god that when the enemy comes against you and he comes to bluff you you can stand notice he didn't use the word bow he didn't use the word amen run away he said you can stand and then knowing what to do when the enemy comes let me say tonight young people that time is at hand to make a stand let me say tonight elders the time is at hand to make a stand amen the enemy is coming in like never before and then the lid has come off of hell and demon powers are streaming amen to the land tonight if there's ever been a time amen to draw our swords and to stand now is the time amen to stand for paul will say take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand there for having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness now the prophet says brother if you're ever going to make a stand for god make it now this is the time now's the time we need of it another place i want to go on record in heaven tonight and in this audience of chicago and i want to go on record that i stand amen for jesus christ amen can we can we bring that right here to louisiana tonight amen i want to go on record amen before the world amen before my friends before my family i want to go on record tonight i stand amen for jesus christ i stand for righteousness i stand for holiness i stand for this message i stand for the gifts of god i stand for the power of god i stand for revelation i stand amen for the supernatural i stand for the pit of fire that is returned in this age amen to lead the church into victory i stand for it tonight the prophet said now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that antichrist spirit would come into the church and the talent they've been making it lukewarm and formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works his attempt to destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it are you hearing that even he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for notice where your power is coming from he didn't say your power is coming from what you stand against he's saying your power is coming from what you stand for and she can do the greater works than she might be an invincible army she might possibly wake up one day and realize if devils has been lying to her so long have no authority over no sir my prophet said when you recognize who you are and you recognize what you come from and you recognize the word of god can defeat the devil anywhere anytime anyplace under any condition when you recognize what you stand for then you will be an invincible army let me announce it tonight there's not an invincible army coming there's an invincible army here tonight i'm not looking for an invincible army i see one tonight she's not in prophecy she is in fulfillment tonight she is not enlightened she is impressed tonight and then the prophet said she will be an invincible army that's not just a 50 year old preacher that's a 16 year old boy that's a 15 year old girl when she recognizes what she stands for when she recognizes who she is when she recognizes where she comes from when she recognizes the word is greater than the devil against her she will be an invincible army that's not coming that's here tonight she will be if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit desert and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her or y'all hear me tonight satan will be powerless before her he will be deathly forwarded today as with christ we stood in every effort to gain power him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail against them see that's why jesus told peter upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it then that tells me tonight that the whole church of the living god is built upon spiritual revelation the prophet says there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word there is nothing there is no feeling there is no sensation there is no emotion there is no there is no power there is nothing as powerful and as prevailing as the revelation of the word that's when it's more than an education that's when it's more than a head knowledge that's when something in your heart has connected with the unseen and there's a pulsation amen of faith are you hearing me there's a pulsation of faith in there and it's pulsating i am jesus christ i am the way i am the truth i am the life amen now i'm going to take the breaks off and preacher for a second because i just feel to do it right here amen some of you all need to quit waiting and you need to start working on the pulsation you need to quit waiting you've been waiting on that for about 30 years now but someday someday brother tim will strike the right cord someday the singer will get just right someday the holy ghost will come down and put handwriting on the wall and i'll know it's my time to raise up and defeat them devils i say to my church the time is not coming but time is here tonight you've been waiting on the time to come and god has delivered the time right here to you this is your hour and then this is your season this is your anointing the sword is in your hand the outskirt is in your hand the slingshot is in your hand tonight the holy ghost is in your heart the pillar of fire is descended the word is in the church what more can be done for you to recognize this is your time sandor to slay the philistines sometime or another you've got to work on the pulsation you realize that's what the problem god said sam guard done send our words on the pulsation sam dar didn't look over there and see his wife face sunk in and his kids clothes falling off their shoulders and say let me go pray about it and see if it's time to defeat this devil no sir amen sam guard grabbed an ox gold and he went jumped out the window are you hearing me hey can i preach here for a second there's some things you ain't got to pray about well but then i'm praying about getting rid of this devil you ain't got to pray about that well i'm praying about getting the holy ghost you ain't got to pray about that what i'm praying about is this message right now you ain't got to pray there's some things you ain't got to pray about it's written in the word that's why the devil's got you sitting there bound is because you've been waiting on an answer when you've already got the answer you've been looking for a sign that god has already come down in the sign of the messiah and revealed to you through this message it's your time church are you hearing me hey you know what happened amen sambar come to a spot he said enough is enough ain't then he said enough is enough he said look here here's what we can do we can continue amen to keep making deals with the devil or we can do something about it right here on a wednesday night we can do something about it i feel like preaching the aisle for a minute even right here on a wednesday night we can draw a line in the sand we can say devil you've been encroaching you've been coming in you've been pushing you've been pushing and we better backing up amen but tonight there's a fight in the house of god amen tonight there is a power and then tonight there is a zeal amen tonight there is a word there is an authority behind this message and you know what it's coming it's sounding satan your day is over your day is finished your time has hit me you hear me as wrong that you're gonna hold me you've tormented me as long as you're gonna torture me there's a faith that is raising the bill and tonight all things are possible all things are possible you're not going to be the invincible army you are tonight samgar looked around there and he saw all that conditions and he said you know what he said enough is enough he said i'll have to pray about this no longer there's an ox gold and there's an enemy there's an ox gold and there's an enemy and the devil had tried for years to get sam daughter and forget one thing you're the seed of abraham and the promise said amen that every seed of abraham shall possess the gates of their enemies sam guard took off a running and he jumped down the window are you hearing me and he saw them for this thing's coming i can imagine brother tim he went about halfway up the road and he took that ox code and he'd draw the line in the sand he said listen he said there's the line okay he said there'll be nothing as long as you don't start nothing he said but the very minute the very minute the first toe the the first big toe of one euphemistic steps on this side of the line it's home and they compress it and they come pushing and they come twisted and sandbar said come on amen come on they said you ain't gonna do nothing samgar it's a wednesday night sam guard said come on he said you ain't gonna do nothing sandra you ain't no longer can't meet him he said come on sand guard you ain't gonna do nothing ain't no way you can do nothing you're just a young lady sam guard said come on and the very minute that the philistines even crossed the line samgar set its own and i say to not sacred there is some standards and it's in this building tonight and we say come on and then bring your fear bring your scare bring your depression bring your complexes bring it all tonight are you hearing me this is not a church of fear this is a church of faith this is not a church of doubt this is a church of belief are you hearing me when chandar said it's enough it was enough sam garnew who he was you see what this message is doing to you it's building up your faith [Music] help me jesus it's building up your faith amen service after service after service it's building up your faith your outward man is perishing but the inward man's getting stronger your senses are trying to bind you but the holy ghost has awoken the supersense which is the sixth sense called faith and it's ready to draw the sword now the bible says as you therefore receive christ jesus the lord so walking in him they've been rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as ye have been taught notice this abounding therein with thanksgiving beware lest any man spool you through philosophy and vain deceit after the traditions of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ amen can i preach here for a minute beware lest any man try to spool your victory well brother it's not just it's not our church tradition to shout amen traditions are okay as long as it's about as long as it's about the family the family gravy boat at dinner amen but there ain't no room for traditions in the house of gods are you hearing me amen rudiments and vain philosophy of men you can go feed on that all you want to amen but don't bring that nonsense in the house of god we don't need philosophy we don't need psychology we don't need theology we need the same god amen that came down upon standard ain't going to fall upon the church today and he will perform his word the prophet said i want you to see i want to see you rooted and grounded in that holy faith i don't want to see you tossed about but every wind of doctrine come by shake you and carry on have a little blood in their hands he said no sir he said i want you to be built solid on the word if it's thus saith the lord you stay with it amen you live with it that's the urine thumb of this day god wants you to live by that if it's not in the word then you forget about it you live for christ see we walk from the altar amen a new person in christ jesus then you all have to depend on your church depend on your priest depend on your pastor you're depending on the shed blood of the lord jesus by grace are you saved now can i tell you what the message of the hour is doing the message of the hour is building up individuals the prophet said we're not building organization i'm not here this morning to do that christ never sent me to build organization christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of jesus christ that they might be the powerhouse and the dwelling place of the spirit by his word see build up the individual to that place not the organization not a greater denomination but build the individual amen to sons and daughters of god and may i say tonight the bride of christ is not a fair woman amen the bride of christ is not a scared lady amen the bible says the bride of christ he is a faith woman for paul says by grace are you saved amen through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god the prophet said in disobedience this little faith woman that lives by faith the bride believers the word of god obedient waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed she is watching for it she is part of that word and she is watching for her life to manifest that word the body is waiting for which is the word waiting for the life which is the spirit amen to confirm it and make it live that's what she's waiting for no other life will work in her then you can't put the life of theology in the bride and her get victory you cannot put the life of psychology in the bride and her possess the promises the only life that works in her is the life of god that said let there be see then the bride of jesus christ is not a dying woman amen she is not a she is not a scared woman she is an abounding bride you say what do you mean by that i say quit thinking this bride is living on life support well let's preach a minute maybe quit thinking this bride is just barely getting by from wednesday barely getting by to sunday barely hanging on the youth camp barely hanging on the convention barely hanging on to the next revival no this bride is an abounding bride amen if this class the skies are cloudy brother tim she's an abounding bride if there's no rain coming she's in the boundary listen the conditions of the world does not change the conditions of the bride she is in a browning bride she is full of miracles hey can i preach to you for a minute amen she is full of miracles you say for the miracles yes sir because the bride herself is a miracle paul said god is able to make congress a bound towards you that you have sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work another place you said furthermore we beseech you brother and exhort you by the lord jesus that is you receive us how you ought to walk and please god so ye would abound amen more and more then when god does something for you amen he doesn't expect that to die and then you go to another camp and try to revive it but he does that so one experience and then leads to another experience and another experience leads to a deeper experience until you yourself amen are a house on fire in a windy day you see what the word of bound means it means to exceed a fixed number or measure it means to be preeminent it means to excel it means to excel more amen than one expects one to excel are y'all hearing me ain't been the devil brother let him know he didn't expect you to be in the house of god here tonight he put a limit on your blessing he said all right i'll let him kill the holy ghost i'll let him testify i'll let him fall out of the power of god but he won't be on that front roll wednesday night but do you realize just your being here tonight has already exceeded amen the devil's limitations upon what god done in your life are you hear me if a man done something for you this weekend you wouldn't be here tonight if it was just a man you still wouldn't have the faith in your heart but because it wasn't a man it was god to come on the scene then what god does will remain eternal what god does will never fail what god does will stand the test of time what god does will stand the lion's dead helping somebody what god does will stand and try to go out and save good life your head's coming off see when god does something the devil puts a limit upon it but god puts an anointing upon it to exceed the devil's limitations oh the devil says you know what we're tonight you're going to be so tired you ain't going to raise your hand and you know what you do you come in the house of god and you raise your hand the devil says you ain't going to be able to go back home and live a victorious life and you know what you say watch me the devil says you ain't going to be able to go back home and kick those habits out of your life and you say watch me stand back and watch them the devil says ain't no way amen ain't no way you're going to go back to school and keep the same victory you had before you went to that amendment you know what you're going to do stand back and watch me and can i tell you what the devil's trying to do he's trying to put a limit on you and so you ain't going to take a rapture but you know what i say stand back and watch if god exceeded your expectations therefore and what god done for me he'll do it again the devil can put as many limits as he wants to on this church as he wants to upon your brothers ministries as he wants to upon your lives but when god has said it's going to abandon there is no devil past or presence or future that can fix the limits of what god says that's going to be come on church you're not dealing with man's potentials you've got god's potentials in you man's potentials will not go go no further than a church service but god's potentials will keep on going yes sir this is the time amen for all things you say the time for all things yes sir the bible says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven in ecclesiastes 3 3 the bible says there is a time to kill and there is a time to heal i love this one there is a time to break down and a time to build up there is a time to tear down there is a time to build up these are things there are things that we must somebody shout we must there are things we must tear down but remember there are also things we must also build up there are things that must be torn down they must be demolished they must be destroyed there must be a holy ghost atomic bomb they've been dropped out of heaven on them things and annihilate them things but at the same time something is torn down at the same time something is annihilated then something has got to be built up you say what are you talking about the problem god said if the devil goes out he said something has got to come in and fill that up he said lord the devil will come back with seven more devils and you'll be worse off than the first time he said so when the devil goes out amen the holy ghost has got to come in listen it's got to go beyond your flesh it's got to go beyond your spirit it's got to go into the depths of your soul and seal that soul not until the next camp meeting maybe not until the next church service but unto the day of redemption what does the word build up the word build up means to establish amen to rebuild amen to cause to continue so what god done for you this weekend or what god's doing in your life even right now god does not desire amen for you to allow that devil to tear it down the message of the hour came amen to restore or to build us back to the original faith right now the bible says behold i will send you elijah the prophet he shall turn the heart somebody said the heart he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smile the earth with a curse in jude 1 3 the bible says beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints now do you realize we're living in a time of prophecy we're living in a time where the bible speaks about two different categories of people the bible says in timothy that in the last days evil spirits will come in they'll be seducers and they will seduce they will wax worse and worse they will be deceived and they'll be deceiving they'll be deceiving spirits he said there'll be some that are departing from the faith you know what that word depart means it means to draw back from it means to pull back it means to leave something that one should be embracing it needs to pull back and to excite a revolt so notice this when somebody departs from the faith which the faith is the word which is the message of the hour what do they do they start a revolt and they say you need to get out of there as well see if they'd get that excited amen about the faith for serving god that they did about leaving god imagine where they would be but they excite a revolt and they say come on you got to get out of that message it's nothing but bondage but do you realize there's a prophecy speaking to them that some are going to depart from the faith but there's another prophecy amen speaking that some are going to contend for the faith amen some are going to depart from the faith amen but some are going to contend for the faith and i don't know what you know but i'll tell you what i know i'm not a departer i'm a contender i'm not a departer i am a contender some are called me depart some are called to go you know what some are called they meant to have youtube ministries and put the message on trial and put brother branham on trial and give their sorry old sob story of why they left the message and how much bond is in the message and you know what i've come to conclusion of we can argue with them all day long we could we can tie it with a job until our fingers get carpal tunnel we can argue until our fingers fall off and you know what brother we ain't gonna change them but can i tell you something else they ain't gonna change us either i'm not wasting my time if they want to depart let them depart i say god have mercy but there's some here come on church there's some here that's ordained to contend there's some here that's ordained to finish there's some here that's ordained across the finish line there's some here that's our name to walk the streets of those there's some here that's ordained to look at walls of jasper there's some here this ordained to walk through the gates that are already hung and are already hence there is a bride on the earth that is not dying she is abounding in the last days see what happens the devil don't realize he thinks we're getting weaker but in reality we're there we're getting stronger see i want to tell the devil i'm stronger now than i've ever been before he didn't like that but i really don't care we're stronger now than we've ever been before you see why because we're not at the bottom we have come to the top one of them was martin luther he began to shine a lot then here come wesley come stronger he began to shine the baptism of the holy ghost strong or stronger there he said rather here come pentecostal begin to shine the baptism of the holy ghost but in the last days in the last days of malachi 4 elijah is to come with the very word what turned the hearts of the children back to the faith of god he says that fourth light satan and the bride is a faith woman that is called out by his name let me just say this amen tonight i want to say it like this we have seen the sign and we have heard the voice we are not here looking for a message we have found the message we are not here trying to find what god promised to do in this day god has sent a lot and that light is lined right up with the word and revealed to you the promises of the day you're living in then it's time to lay aside every creed it's time to lay aside every dogma it's time to lay aside every tradition and walk in the word of your age and i'll just say it like this as the bride of jesus christ as a church now i'm gonna i'm gonna preach here for a minute we'll go home okay amen as the bride of jesus christ we find that the devil wants to destroy our homes he wants to destroy our families he wants to destroy our lives he'll do everything he can to destroy individuals and when he can't destroy your home when he can't destroy your life when he can't destroy your family when he can't destroy the pastor when he can't destroy the ministry the devil comes to try and destroy the church now any church that's been established for any amount of time has been through all seasons that a church goes through you've been through shouting times and you've been through pounding times now don't start pouting on me now okay you've been through running times and you've been through walking times you've been through you've been through you've been through fiery times and you've been through cold times we are still human we go through all seasons that that is that as nature goes through a church goes through those same seasons and as a church you begin to accumulate things it's a church you begin to accumulate things now what does the word accumulate mean it means together together or acquire an increasing number or quantity gradually gather amen a require a resulting hole amen it means to build up now there's a story of a man who was growing we're really weary one time in serving god and that man got so low that he got down on his knees and he said lord i'm going to stop serving you he said but before i go i want to take just a few moments and i want to thank you for all the things you've done for me and he got down on his knees and began to thank you for healing him he began to thank him for paying his bills when he didn't have them he began to thank god of all different things that happened throughout his life that come to this spot and by the time the man got done praying he said well lord you've done too much for me now to quit i guess i'll just go on serving you realize do you realize what happened that man got down before god and he began to accumulate not all the bad things but all the good things he began to accumulate all the things that god had done for him and notice where he accumulated those things he didn't accumulate him in his head he accumulated them in his heart then they asked you a personal question tonight what are you accumulating the bible says lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven we're neither moth nor rusteth corrupt where thieves do not break through or steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also that word treasure actually means a place in which good and valuable and precious things are collected and laid up it means a storehouse amen or a repository it means a place where good things are put and that tells me tonight brother that our heart actually is a storehouse look what david said he said with my whole heart have i sought thee oh let me not wonder for my commandments and thy word i have hid that treasure he had in my heart that i might not sin against thee paul says we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we have this treasure where in earth and vessels in our heart that the excellency of the power may not be of us but it might be of god why because what man does has failed it will fail it will always fail and it is failing but what god does will remain see i want to read you something here in spiritual food and new season i want you to get built up now in the holy oracles of god in the faith the faith of this hour the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be a rapturing faith be taken up and so we want you to believe tonight and so we want you to believe tonight in all that you have seen all that you have heard the word that you've heard preached the signs and wonders you've seen done amen are you awake am i going too long are you hearing me we want you to believe tonight and all you have seen we want you to believe in all that you've heard we want you to believe the word that you've been preached we want you to believe the signs and the wonders that you've seen down we want you to accumulate all of that together in your heart and consider whether if it be god or not help me jesus it's like elizabeth said if god be god then serve him and if jesus be the center of all things to the christian then i think we ought to let loose of everything else and cleave to him he then remember he is the center he is the lord star he is the ultimate he is the absolute if the north star if he's the north star there's only one thing that'll point to the north star that's your compass that you're sailing with see notice this i am telling you to sail with this word for the word always points to him then what is thinking remember the aaron thinking is accumulating when you begin to think you begin to accumulate when a man begins to think he begins to accumulate that's what the bible here says for as he thanketh in his heart so is he look at what this word think of mean it means to reason out it means to calculate it means to reckon it means to estimate the prophet said the hours come when god set forth his light there's an hour that when god's doing things amen nudge your neighbor and say this is the hour when god is doing things brother aaron this is the hour when god is doing things brother tim this is the hour when god is healing brain bleach this is the hour when god is healing cancer brother ron this is the hour when god has taken tumors out of people's body are you hearing me right here in the church this is the hour listen we've lived through denominational ages where man has done all kinds of things and it's all dried up and it's all washed away but there is a god of gods and the king of kings and the lord of lords is on the scene tonight church and he is doing some wonderful things he's healing the sick he's saving the laws he's restoring marriages he's tearing down strongholds he's bringing families back together he's revealing himself to the hearts and lives of his people are you hearing me man's done a lot but now it's time to stand back and watch god god has come on to say listen church god is taking tumors out of sister elena's body god amen has put hair back up on my head are you hearing me you know why people ain't got no strength to praise god because they've been accumulating the negative things they've been accumulating all the negativity and all the false doctrines and all who's doing what who's saying that's all they think about amen you want to know what something can i thank somebody to hear there's a guy told me one time he said i'm sick and tired of hearing preachers going around talking about all god's doing in their churches and all god's doing their ministries and all god's doing for their people that's what brother quit talking so negative might do something for you when all you do is feed on negativity it brings a negative atmosphere it brings a negative feeling it brings a negative service it brings a negative sermon but when you begin to accumulate everything in your heart that you've seen god do even like tabernacle won't you take a few minutes right now and begin to accumulate all the miracles you've seen god do you've seen raise the dead you've seen them stop and when you begin to accumulate all that god has done it begins to turn something on the inside of that and you can't contain your praise [Applause] don't mind the dancing don't mind me you don't know all that god has done for me sit there if you want to sit there and proud if you want to remember there's some people here that's been up against some walls but they've seen the walls come back there's some people here let's face devils but they've seen them devils come down there's some people here let's have to stand turning for their life against the devil but here we are tonight we're still standing because god is doing some wonderful things in this generation y'all just forgive me a minute we got some victory here tonight everything man's done is failed but what god has done will never fail listen the devil chose a man's head but god chose a man's heart are you hearing me the bible says there's two types of accumulation there's negative and then there's positive my bible says brethren whatsoever things are true what several things are honest but certain things are just or pure or lovely are of a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise amen think or accumulate these things if there be any victory in the church then forget about who didn't shake your hand if there'd be any if there be any liberty in the church then forget the pastor didn't compact you on the shoulder [Applause] can i preach a minute he said let me talk about he said when god began to deal with someone's heart he's preparing them for something see fake on these things don't think negative you think positive thank jesus you sit in church and think about everything else but god you set church and accumulate every fault every failure every negative thing you accumulate all that he said how are you going to do your washing what are you going to do at the office tomorrow how are you going to do this any other keep your mind off of that keep your mind off of that and think on god if there be any praise if there be any virtue then think on these things don't think on the negative thoughts don't let it go for your mind make every word positive and every thought positive see it listen the preacher which is the bringer of the word his gift is to get himself out of the way but the believer which is the hearer of the word must get yourself out of the way to receive the word that's being brought by the bringer now you may not like this quote but that's quite all right the only thing you have to do is know he is here is get yourself out of the way when you think your thoughts then god's thoughts don't have a chance when you think your thoughts then god's thoughts don't have a chance but if you'll quit thinking your thoughts and think his thoughts like this little lady laying here shaking this card that woman is going to lay there all of her life unless she she can get her faith right straight on jesus christ and no matter what comes or goes it be revealed to her then nothing is going to stop her healing are you hearing me amen if you can get your thoughts off of everything else and on the word of god and a revelation bell drop in your heart that this is your night this is your season i've been laying here long enough it's time to get up brother tim and it's time to walk it's time to go somewhere it's time to stop thanking them oh negative come on church you say lander you're just preaching the prosperity gospel i'm preaching from the message of the hour if every heart and every mind and every spirit would come in accordance with god's word eating unlike tabernacle you think you've seen miracles you ain't seen nothing yet you think you've seen god move you lay aside every negative thoughts you forget every injustice you forget everything that ever happened you forget every thought the devil's trying to get you to faith and just start considering was it gone or not to give them the holy ghost was it god or not that put air back on mariah's head was it god or not it rained sister karen out of that brain bleeding was it god or not that he'll elena are you hearing me was it god that healed her body i say yes and i say if he's god and he did it then he can do it again but i think on the negative you were given access for the negative to come into you and by giving access to the negative you become a negative person a negative preacher produces a negative pulpit and a negative pulpit produces negative views is this okay and a negative pew produces a negative church in the community and before long that negative church dies up and dries up [Applause] but a positive word are you hearing me the problem said i don't like anything negative i don't like the negative side i like to be on the positive side you know what sometimes you got to do brother you just got to come in church and you've got to forget everything and just worship god coleman told me one time he splattered he said sometimes you got to go to church and preach he said i can't do it myself he said you just have to close your eyes and just preach whatever god put on your heart he said cause people will frown at you they'll stare you down they'll try to cut you off he said if you just close your eyes just preach right on through i'll tell you what that's good advice for some church members wherever they knew so-and-so is looking at me and so-and-so might see me sound and so-and-so might see me rejoice i say close your eyes and remember if he's the ultimate if he's the north star if he is the compass that we're standing by if he's the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of taken that he's the god of even not tabernacle and there is no limits there is no limit there's no limits on my god my god can go in the fiery purpose my god can walk on water my god can turn water into wine my god can stop demon possession come on church you want to revive or take the limits off of god brother tim it's just the witness tonight that's a limit you put on god i don't care if it's wednesday i don't care if it's monday i don't care if it's sunday when you begin to accumulate and you'll begin to remember that god is still god he'll come down in the fourth man he'll come down and the fourth man and he'll push back that bout and he'll push back that fear go ahead go ahead accumulate all that you see accumulation her preach accumulate all the miracles we shall see miracles we see americans we are a miracle you've been looking for a miracle so long and you're looking at one tonight he lost the soul that he probably [Applause] is you know why you're so weak and faithful you've been complaining too long preacher lander thinking i believe i will i think one of the hardest things you see a man or woman doing is constantly complaining i've always thought god keep me from it see that weakens faith all the time well glory now let me show you this the seven angel shows the connection between obedience and your confession he shows you your body's gonna obey your confession if it's a native confession it'll be a negative obedience that if it's a positive confession it'll be a positive obedience can i give the devil a black guy is that okay let the weak cow let him this week let him this week let him this week tonight say i am strong let him this week come on are you weak tonight go ahead and say it i am strong say it in the balcony i am strong saying the sound booth i am strong sing it on the pulpit i am strong ain't no never gonna know we're weak because we're not weak god is here tonight god is fighting for us his word is true let the weak say i am strong just say in your heart i am strong i have now accepted jesus as my healer and never have any negative testimony anymore god is my healer i am saved i am delivered i am healed i am free i am victorious i am going to relax i'm going into [Applause] [Applause] i [Applause] [Applause] what is the attraction in the house of god i'll tell you what it is it's people that's no longer being naked [Applause] i've seen people come on the platform i'd say you do you believe oh i got all the faith in the world now i don't mean to belittle them i respect that but do you know what it is it's hope instead of faith but faith does the job right now hope hope for it but faith is a product so we want to change from hope to positive faith and there's only one way we can get positive faith that's about thinking positive thanks come on you realize what abraham did abraham believed in the face of there being no hope brotherhood said every time i get to peel it blue i go over there and i read up the negative and i turn on the news and i call the biggest gossip in the church no i don't know what message you're reading he said when i get to feeling blue i read romans chapter four notice abraham had to love god to believe him and the more you love him the more faith will you accumulate are you hearing me tonight we are not the recipients of abraham's hope we are the recipients of abraham's faith and abraham's faith his works expressed his faith do you realize what abraham did abraham began to accumulate faith are you hearing me you know what he did he went to toys r us they're going back in business by the way and he bought him he bought him a crib he bought him some toys are you hearing me he bought sarah diaper bag he bought her he bought a stroller he began to accumulate he didn't go home and hang the negative doctor's report on the wall and look at it every day and say sarah's body's dead her milk vengeance right up there's no life to me no he began to feed on tanks that was feet that was feeding a faith seed on the inside of his heart are you hearing me tonight i believe there's some people right now that needs to go and tear down every negative image you need to tear down every negative doctor's report what do you say hey man i got in this at the youth camp but i'm gonna get it right here for a minute okay we've heard about abraham right we've heard about sarah we've heard about jairus's daughter and we've heard about all kinds of people in the bible that god come on the scene and performed a miracle but can i can i use a modern day example today are you with me you know who i'm going to talk about i'm going to talk about a man named ron spencer you say why are you going to talk about him to build a man up oh get that devil out of here i hate that devil every time you go to talk about what god's done in this state adam devil rears his head and says well all he's doing is building up a man go fly a kite somewhere i'm not building up a man i'm building up the it's in the man are y'all hearing me tonight do you realize the doctor said brother wrong should be dead tonight but you know what he's alive he's alive you know why because he didn't go accumulate all the doctors reports and begin to call everybody and get a bunch of pity he began to stand and say if he did it before he'll do it again are you hearing me are you hearing me tonight let me tell you something if god could believe the heavens share a promised child if he could give hannah son if he could bring him if he could bring a child out of the virgin womb by the name of mary that i believe with all of my heart he could bring one's picture through a stroke he could bring him to the fire he could bring him through heart trouble and he can bring him to cancer and he'll come out on the other side and say accumulate this church god is still god and his word is still the truth but you know why if there's faith in this church tonight it's because of many god like with a team and these men and princes like brother rod and all these men of god that will come behind the pulpit and say quit accumulating all the negativity and start remembering the promise oh satan get out of here satan get out of here we ain't got a spirit of defense tonight we've got the spirit of faith are you hearing me we're not accumulating a bunch of offenses tonight we're accumulating some faith here you know what amen i'm gonna i'm gonna close right here hebrews 11 amen it's not the heroes of the fence hebrews 11 is the heroes of faith so while some people have been accumulating defenses and they can't even raise their hands no more used to shout and run the aisles but they got so many offenses well so-and-so looked at me wrong and so and so dead accumulate all the fences and sit there like a wallflower if you won't but there's some of us we're going to accumulate some faith you realize there was a man named congressman shaw who in 1900's madison was nowhere near where it is today and william shaw was an 18 year old boy who fell and broke his spine being involved in the turn of the century was worse than anyone could imagine and an 18 year old boy was told come to terms you'll never walk again just come to terms with it you'll never get the victory over it just come to terms with it it'll always be this way but the next seven years he would lay in bed and eventually he would learn to walk again with crutches and you know what he would call them his little buddies but you know what i love brother phillip you know what i love he faced challenges but he built inner strength oh it went over your head he faced challenges but he built inner strength william upshaw became famous for three saiyans let nothing discourage you let nothing discourage you and the second one was never give up and you know what i love i love the third one oh william shaw would say god will heal me it just isn't time yet brother tim i'm about to put another door in this church god will heal me it just isn't time yet and for 66 years he sat in a wheelchair and accumulated all the faith and accumulated all the power and one night in 1951 a prophet said i see you i see you fall over over the hayman he said oh but tonight you're not and a man who had been in a wheelchair for 66 years jumped up and ran up on the platform and touched his toes you know why because he had accumulated even some faith in his heart he hadn't accumulated all the hurts he hadn't accumulated all the offenses he had accumulated faith what are you saying preacher i'm standing right here tonight i'm going to give you some accumulation are you ready the bride's revival right now is in action can i have five minutes that rides revival 10 okay let's take that up to timothy amen the bride's revival right now is sure causing quite a stir across the land the air is charged and the coming lord jesus had charged that air it looked like the teachers i don't know what was going to take place but you realize we got preachers and teachers right now that deny what's happening in this building you know why because they can't be a part of it but i'll tell you why we're shouting it's because it isn't changed today but the holy spirit is for around the coming lord jesus and as the holy spirit begins to stretch out across the earth revival fires are breaking out everywhere great signs and wonders has been done healing has taken place prophecies that went forth are you ready for this are you ready for this can i read it all the gathering of the apostolic blessings has come back to the church again get out of my way i'll get out that's it all you hear me tonight while the world is accumulating defenses while the world is accumulating there is a church that is accumulated what was in the book of acts what was in the upper room is in this church tonight brother and when you took off dancing a minute ago do you know what that was that was the same holy ghost that filled the upper room what are you saying i'm saying god is god and he's doing some things today now you know what i can do i can take the next five minutes and i can read you about bible days i can read to you about the nation brother branham but can i read to you about march 11th 12th 13th and 14th [Music] and i want you to accumulate all these things in your heart and i want you to consider was it god or not but andrew are you talking about everybody look at the camp no i've got some testimonies from people standing this field tonight i have dealt with anxiety off and on for a long time about my hair all falling out again and the devil was telling me you're just going to go bald and nobody's going to like you but on thursday night uncle timothy preached on scarecrows i went up for prayer and i thank god but i didn't feel a real breakthrough on friday night i went through the prayer line but i still didn't get my breakthrough on saturday night i almost didn't go up and get prayed for because i worried what people would think for a while the devil has been holding over me my past wrongs saying you can't get delivered because you did this so on saturday night i went and got prayed for and i was like devil you just shut your mouth what you say i was like devil just shut your mouth i knelt at the altar and i just started thanking the lord for my deliverances and the song leaders started singing my chains are gone i've been set free i immediately felt the tormenting spirits leave and the holy ghost bled my soul and i just collapsed i was still conscious and i wanted to get up and dance but i was so drunk i couldn't move i laid in his presence for hours until they took me back to the dorms and i'm still thinking god i feel all clean and on fire i have no thoughts in the back of my mind about my hair i feel free and happy like never before and to thank i almost missed my moments but i thank the lord that i didn't i almost missed it but i thank the lord that person's in this building tonight my experience here's another one my experience with the holy what are you doing i'm accumulating some things my experience with the holy ghost at camp was amazing when i found out we were gone i immediately started having expectations i was praying to receive the holy ghost what i expected was not even close to what i experienced to receive he'll meet your exceed limitations [Applause] on saturday night i became an underage drinker drinking off that blue wine the holy ghost all the services was amazing but that night was my turn before service my friend told me i was going to get drunk and i got excited because that's what i've been praying for and uncle timothy began preaching on the line he said there's enough for everyone that's when i said to myself he's preaching to me i then begin to create an atmosphere that god could come into me and when the song service started we started waving our white flags that's when he took control of me i started laughing uncontrollably every time i tried standing i started staggered that's when i knew i was drunk off the holy spirit it was the best feeling ever i thank god this can't i never could forget i thank god for letting me experience something like that can i give you another one as of friday night in oklahoma god delivered me of my old ways the music i listened to the way i talk and act if god can do it for me i have no doubt he can do it for someone else go ahead and joshua are you hearing me oh what are you doing i'm waving some white victory in here i'm waving some white flags in victory i was going to camp for a refill of the holy ghost and a special touch from the lord when i say a special touch i mean i really wanted to touch from him to get rid of something that i had and the weird thing is i didn't really know what it was that i had i just knew there was something hindered me in my walk with the lord i didn't really know what it was though i just knew something wasn't right and i needed to get rid of it so i went to the prayer line friday night and i got my refill and i went through it felt like something was lifted off my shoulders i jumped and screamed and didn't care i was just so happy that whatever it was lifted off of me i felt so freaked just to let go and rejoice in my freedom i went back to my seat feeling amazing i didn't rush the next day i was delivered from the complex thursday and all day friday it was really windy so my hair was all over the place i kept thinking about how terrible i probably looked and i was embarrassed like really embarrassed saturday wasn't too different concerning the wind but i didn't care it felt so good not to worry about what other people thought about me what did they think of me it wouldn't really change who i was or how i acted but the thought was always there it made me doubt myself and it really hindered me from a lot of things it hindered me from singing in church my family told me when i got home how they were really proud of me for letting go when i sing sunday morning to be honest it felt good to me too i love to sing but i've always doubted how i sounded it didn't matter what people told me i've always doubted myself but it felt so good to let go and praise him with the gift he gave me this ain't 50 years ago this is somebody in this building tonight because the devil's already trying to make me doubt it he's just so stupid he's done this before and he thinks i'm going to fall for it again but ain't he dumb testimony from camp it's just it's short but for me it's a big thing the devil been making me question in my mind if i had the holy ghost and when i went for prayer saturday night brother joe spoke to me and there was clarity and now i know that i know that i am filled now it's time to turn up my praise [Applause] [Applause] this is a church i came to camp with extreme nervousness and depression during the morning service god delivered me both during the night service god refilled me with the holy ghost i came to camp i came to camp with tormentors but i'm leaving completely free that's only a part of what god did for me he met me answered questions i'd only talk to him about falling in love with jesus causes everything else to fall into place i will never be the same brother god preaching in it do you remember saturday night with the holy ghost moved on to you to go tell brother wendell to call the spirit out remember he said brother joe coming back i'm trying to quit call the spirit now by the window tell them if they're battling pornography if they're battle battle lust so there's a there's a spirit i keep hearing over in this prayer life brother joe i guarantee you the devil battles your mind for going to doing that but can i give the devil a black guy for battle in your mind before a camp i had a problem with lust and pornography but saturday nights before i got in the prayer line for 20 minutes the devil kept on coming to tell me not to go in the parallel because i would be embarrassed with what i'd done after a while i didn't care how embarrassed i would be i got in the prayer line brother joe prayed for me and the holy ghost fell on me and delivered me in that spirit i went back to my seat i didn't feel so saved to come to you until you pray for me and while you were praying god came down and filled me with the holy spirit [Applause] if he's the god of the bible if he's the god of the message if he's the god of abraham and the god of elijah he's the god of the evil light he's the god of [Applause] he's allah god of temple he's the god of andrew brother he's the god of testament are you hearing me tonight he's the god of character my god is dead my god is alive somebody waved some victory this is of it we're free we got victory when the lord shall build up he shall appear in his glory what's the happening this bride's revival spreading all across the land [Music] [Applause] tell me something all right now i was wondering what's wrong with them guys what's wrong with them waving their white flags to victory what's wrong with that can i tell you what can i tell you what it is i heard the problem with god say one day he said i see the devil's in hell right now he said they're waving black flags to defeat he said but i also see the angels of god he said i see somebody getting saved i see somebody get healed and i see the angels they get the wave on my flag of victory but you know what i said i said if the angels can wave a flag about my victory that they're not even experiencing don't you think i got a right to wave a flag about my victory [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh let's just praise him for a while [Applause] you

acted just an idiotic like the rest of them did just as drunk as the rest of them was [Music] these men and women every one of them was full of new wife and if god has ever changed that program put your finger on the scripture it isn't there no sir it was plumb onto the end of the age that way plumb onto the end of the bible and it will be the same thing when jesus comes oh praise the name of the lord i have a right to the presence of god and the holy ghost [Applause] my children has a right hallelujah mercy mercy mercy mercy you know in this in this let me tell you a few more let's accumulate a couple more things there was a little baby that was brought up on the first night i believe it was maybe friday night had scabs all over his body from eczema just tore up everywhere scabs [Music] yes this is a baby given to a little couple over in amarillo texas been trying for some 10 or more years and god came on the scene and gave him a baby let's accumulate that a little [Music] we bit some white flags of victory here tonight he's still god he made the promise he's going to perform what he said he would do but the devil come and try to flick this little baby but had scabs all over his body and it's scratching himself to death we came we came up for prayer we laid our hands on it and cursed that thing by sunday morning scabs were falling off new skin was growing just as pink as it can be hallelujah i believe it was just a natural sign of what god also did in the spirit there was people that went there with scabs and scars and every kind of thing but the spirit of god came down and apart applies for bob and gillian and it took it all away and now i'm a new creator in christ blessed be the name of the lord let me tell you another one [Music] sister sarah beth she's not here tonight anything i thought she went but she was there at that meeting and over here on this side kind of like tonight was the spirit of god poured out on some girls and they fell out began to just get drunk just drunk a lot of underage drinking was going on there [Music] new wine found some of that new wine [Music] they found some of that original man fell on the day of pentecost and got them a couple mouthfuls sister sarah beth was one of them i actually when my daughter was there and i went over there after some time and knelt down beside her and was praying for there was a brother that was standing at the door and i asked him when i walked up i said what's going on here and he said you know i don't know i get just kind of just looking at it trying to figure it out because it was very astounding what god was doing and it was beyond normal amen but i like it when god breaks our normal stuff and our traditions and how what we think how the holy ghost ought to act i i kind of figured out i feel like in the bible where it says they were drunk they wasn't acting normal they accused him of getting on some bottles somewhere you know he said hey they're not drunk as you supposed but this is that that the prophet joel spoke about i'll pour out my spirit we witnessed that and that and i said i pulled katie up on the floor and sat on the bench there and was talking and praying with her and my you talking about drunk said how you doing katie i'm good i looked over there and there was this girl laid over in the other girl's lap and she's crying and out and i look around at her and i couldn't even tell who it was seemed like her countenance was changed last little sister that was in her lap i said who is that she said that's sarah beth i said wow i didn't even recognize her sister sarah beth wrote me on the way home she says i just want to let you know i really enjoyed the service last night i know many amazing things happened to people i've struggled with a lot of different health and stomach issues for years that i couldn't seem to get rid of i went to the doctor to doctor trying to figure it out was going on but nobody knew what was happening i felt sick to my stomach like i had to have had some sort of every every single time i've eaten every single day for years i got prayed for for all of it at our church and had faith that was gone but let the doubt in my mind come back and never i never let it go at the beginning of service i was thinking about all of it and thinking about how i didn't have to have that feeling of it but i knew i wanted my healing i told myself i'd know when i when it was gone without a doubt and i'm telling you after all of that i have no doubt in my mind that it's gone i'm just so happy i don't have to deal with any doctors any blood drawn or any stomach pain anymore ever since that service i haven't had one more stomach ache and i felt completely normal every time i've eaten hallelujah the savior was there but he's also the healer oh praise the lord amen one more i got to back up through a whole lot of testimonies to get to this mercy brother wendell martin's mother was there sister darlene martin said mom has struggled with her platelet count for quite some time the platelets were what thickens the blood her platelets had been so low that blood was seeping through her skin she had problems with nosebleeds and blood in her stools been quite a roller coaster ride platelets coming up only to crash a little only crashing him the plate's platelets are supposed to be around 250 000 her platelets have hovered around 7 000 up to 15. she has had several blood transfusions iron transfusion has been on oral medications as well as taking intravenous medicine one full day per week at the hospital these medicines are incredibly expensive something like 25 000 for a weekly shot and 11 000 per month for the oral medication a couple weeks ago the doctor decided to postpone her shots and intravenous injections for two weeks to see how low the platelets would fall we had prayer this last weekend she went to the doctor yesterday which was on monday to do blood work her platelets were 270 000. the doctor is beside himself he wants mom to come back in two weeks for more blood work and said he wants to start taking her off the medication as soon as possible my mom is very very excited oh hallelujah he's the savior he's the deliverer he's a healer he's all we have need of and so much more what a mighty god we serve [Music] [Applause] bless them in the name of the lord
