[44:36] to Acts chapter 2 Acts chapter 2 and
[44:43] verse 17 amen this is and it shall come
[44:59] to pass in the last days saith God who
[45:02] said it God said it I will pour out my
[45:06] spirit upon all flesh and your sons and
[45:09] your daughters shall prophesy and your
[45:11] young men shall see visions and your old
[45:14] men shall dream dreams and all my
[45:17] servants and all my handmaidens I will
[45:19] pour out in those days of my spirit and
[45:21] they shall prophesy and I will show
[45:24] wonders in the heaven above and signs in
[45:27] the earth beneath blood and fire and
[45:29] vapor and smoke and the Sun shall be
[45:32] turned into darkness and the moon into
[45:34] blood before the Great and notable day
[45:37] of the Lord come and it shall come to
[45:39] pass that whosoever shall call on the
[45:42] name of the Lord shall be saved
[45:45] amen also just real quick in Revelation
[45:47] 1 and verse 10 it says I was in the
[45:51] spirit on the Lord's Day
[45:53] amen would let you be seated this
[45:55] evening a man just like to speak to you
[46:02] this evening on getting in the spirit
[46:05] getting in the spirit we talked about
[46:08] Sunday about and the Spirit of God moved
[46:10] but we won't just we to really receive
[46:14] from him has got to be more than him
[46:15] just moving but there has to be a
[46:17] response from us say ma'am it has to be
[46:20] a moving of ourselves out of the way so
[46:23] he can come and he can take preeminence
[46:25] in our lives
[46:27] but I want to speak for a moment on
[46:29] these things you know there's two forces
[46:30] that govern the world today two spirits
[46:34] it's the Spirit of Christ and the spirit
[46:37] of the Antichrist we can see these at
[46:39] work since the beginning of time we can
[46:41] see as it come in the garden there and
[46:44] into Cain and Abel and then as they
[46:46] begin to come and bring their sacrifices
[46:49] unto God one got in the spirit of true
[46:52] worship and one got in the spirit of
[46:54] human ability worship amen to worship
[46:58] their own human abilities and know what
[47:00] they can do and what they could bring
[47:01] and my brother Branham says you know we
[47:04] need to watch those spirits and how they
[47:06] begin to move it is the spirit of
[47:09] anything that does the work of it anyhow
[47:12] it takes the spirit to do it the people
[47:14] have to be in this kind of spirit to
[47:17] bring the latter days the people in the
[47:19] spirit have to be in the spirit of the
[47:21] last days the nations are in the spirit
[47:24] of the end time that's why they have the
[47:27] atomic weapons he says in the hydrogen
[47:29] weapons and today you know Russia's
[47:31] testing their supersonic whatever kind
[47:34] of weapons and nuclear powers and - all
[47:36] kinds of things because it's the spirit
[47:39] of the last day and people are in the
[47:42] spirit of the endtime the churches but
[47:45] you said this the people are in the
[47:46] spirit of the endtime and we can we can
[47:49] say man to that because we see a whole
[47:51] group of people that have received the
[47:53] spirit that is prevalent in this last
[47:55] day this Laodicean spirit and they're
[47:58] you know naked and blind wretched and
[48:01] don't even know it has to have need of
[48:03] nothing you know relying once again on
[48:05] their own self and their own abilities
[48:07] ain't meant instead of the things of God
[48:09] amen and they begin to rely on what they
[48:12] can do what they can offer what Who I am
[48:15] amen instead of what God has already
[48:17] done and then and he says but there is a
[48:20] people that is also in the spirit he
[48:23] said the church is moving together under
[48:25] the power and the impact of the Holy
[48:28] Spirit amen the world's running out
[48:31] there and making fun and scoffing and
[48:33] laughing they're living like
[48:35] the devil every day he said it is the
[48:37] spirit of the thing a man Indian I would
[48:40] read a couple things he says in in
[48:42] discernment he said speaking of someone
[48:44] he said between you and me your spirit
[48:47] is speaking to me and I'm speaking back
[48:49] to you through mortal lips but both to
[48:52] anointings he says if this spirit here
[48:55] that's on me to bless you he said not
[48:57] that I can bless you
[48:58] it can bless you he said if but it's
[49:01] only if your spirit is willing to be
[49:03] blessed a man if you have the spirit of
[49:06] unbelief then it cannot bless you
[49:09] it'll just tell you what's wrong it'll
[49:11] tell you something sin you own but if
[49:13] you believe these two spirits can get
[49:16] together it's a battle he said here's a
[49:18] demon crying begging pleading like that
[49:21] and here's the Spirit of God standing
[49:23] there looking at it he said but now it
[49:26] just depends on the way our spirit is
[49:29] running he says I believe if you can get
[49:32] you to believe that what I've said is
[49:34] the truth then something's going to take
[49:36] place you understand what I mean
[49:38] so Amen he said he's saying there's a
[49:40] spirit and upon you and upon me and it
[49:44] depends on who you yield yourself to it
[49:47] was the spirit of sickness in you and or
[49:49] a spirit of sin whatever it is but
[49:51] there's also the Holy Ghost that will
[49:53] stand there and call that thing out and
[49:56] we know he's still calling it out today
[49:57] he's still the discerner of the thoughts
[49:59] and intents of the heart that's never
[50:01] left the word still that ain't math and
[50:03] that word stands in the pulpit and he
[50:05] begins to speak the Spirit of God
[50:07] follows that it begins to tell you but
[50:10] it only depends on who you lend yourself
[50:12] to what spirit that you'll yield
[50:15] yourself to or you'll walk out of here
[50:17] with the same thing or even worse say
[50:19] man I'll walk out of here delivered it's
[50:21] all up to you remember what to be able
[50:23] to get that you got into you got to get
[50:25] to be able to get deliverance you have
[50:27] to get in the spirit of deliverance
[50:29] amen to receive healing you got to get
[50:32] in the spirit of healing to receive
[50:34] these things from God you have to get in
[50:36] the spirit of it amen
[50:38] he says now if I lunch is another one he
[50:40] says if I Lord Jesus when he talked to
[50:42] the woman at the well he didn't just
[50:44] talk to her little while
[50:45] but after a while he talked to her he
[50:47] said go and get me a drink what did he
[50:49] do he caught her spirit and he was
[50:52] trying here he was caught trying to
[50:53] contact that and the first patient here
[50:56] in the platform tonight so are you
[50:58] talking to the person he said I have to
[50:59] contact your spirit you see see we're
[51:01] both men standing here going to meet God
[51:04] one day but you're also a supernatural
[51:07] being inside of you as a spirit that I
[51:10] live somewhere forever if you got a
[51:12] disease Satan did that any but God has
[51:15] sent me to pray so these two spirits
[51:18] will come together then if his spirit
[51:20] can come and it but it will depend on
[51:23] which one you give into of these two
[51:26] spirits amen if you believe that's what
[51:29] you're told it's going to be all right
[51:31] you'll get well if you do not believe it
[51:33] course you can do nothing for you
[51:35] Amen but God is coming to show himself
[51:38] to you but it's up to you to who you'll
[51:41] in your spirit to aim at what you get
[51:43] out of the service is up to you who you
[51:45] lend your spirit to if you lend your
[51:48] spirit to the world and the things of
[51:50] the world and the thoughts of the world
[51:51] and label to see it lukewarm spirit then
[51:53] you're not gonna get nothing out of a
[51:55] service but if you begin to realize
[51:57] there's another spirit here and if I can
[51:59] get into that and begin to worship that
[52:01] and let God come and begin to reveal
[52:04] himself to me if I can yield myself to
[52:06] that spirit then I can go out of here
[52:08] deliver it then I can go out of here
[52:10] healed
[52:11] then I can go out of here save then I
[52:13] can go out of here set free but you got
[52:15] to get into the Spirit of God there has
[52:18] to be something that you got to do he
[52:20] says we cannot have a last day until
[52:23] people get in the spirit of the last day
[52:26] and we can see that all around us people
[52:29] are in the spirit of the last day now
[52:31] they may think they're in the spirit of
[52:33] having fun or or are you know drinkin or
[52:35] whatever but they are actually getting
[52:38] to the spirit of destruction amen God is
[52:41] sending the destruction upon this earth
[52:43] and people are getting into the spirit
[52:45] of it they were getting into the
[52:48] lukewarmness are getting the spirit of
[52:50] sodom and gomorrah it's all around us
[52:53] amen to where it's not in the closet no
[52:55] more but it's out in the front it's
[52:57] pushed on every corner why because
[52:59] people are getting in the spirit of it
[53:01] hey man that's why I was warning a young
[53:03] man yesterday just a few days ago amen
[53:05] he's fixing to go to college that said
[53:07] you need to watch out when you go to
[53:08] those places because their spirits there
[53:11] and their spirits are trying to tear it
[53:13] down Christianity tear down what God is
[53:16] pricing in two positions and try to tear
[53:19] down creation and tear down all things
[53:21] that has to do with God but you better
[53:23] make sure you got the Spirit of God
[53:24] inside of you and if you have that he'll
[53:27] keep you in the middle of all those
[53:29] things if he yield yourself to the
[53:31] Spirit of God the spirit of the
[53:33] Antichrist cannot have control or
[53:36] dominion over you a man who says we
[53:40] cannot have a healing service until
[53:43] people get in the spirit of a healing
[53:45] service we cannot have a feeling of a
[53:48] feeling of the Holy Ghost until people
[53:50] get in that kind of atmosphere you know
[53:53] we can't even have a good service on
[53:54] Wednesday night until people get into
[53:57] the spirit that we're gonna have a good
[53:59] service on a Wednesday night
[54:00] amen it takes some moving you got to
[54:03] move away from your thoughts and from
[54:04] your ideas and who you think what's
[54:06] going on tomorrow and get into the
[54:09] spirit of what God is doing amen

[54:29] moving in your heart
[54:30] Amen but you have to move hey man the
[54:37] people was in that he said that we
[54:39] cannot have a feeling of the Holy Ghost
[54:41] until people get in that kind of that
[54:44] kind of atmosphere the people was in the
[54:47] atmosphere in that day to bring judgment
[54:49] upon the earth and they're in the same
[54:51] East about Noah's day in the snaring the
[54:53] same atmosphere today eating
[54:56] drinking Maron given and married all
[54:58] kinds of things going on and the glory
[55:01] of God is being preached and
[55:03] demonstrated and the power of the Holy
[55:05] Ghost setting forth an example of the
[55:07] preservation of Jesus Christ that's
[55:10] going to take the church in the glory
[55:12] just as certain as I'm standing here and
[55:14] men are ignoring it and paying no
[55:16] attention to it and walking away from it
[55:19] why because they are in the spirit of
[55:21] the last day hey man listen I don't want
[55:25] to come to church and be in the spirit
[55:27] of some other thing and miss God's
[55:29] Spirit amen

[55:35] fear anxiety or whatever the
[55:37] lukewarmness hi I want to cast all that
[55:39] society man I want to lay it all aside
[55:42] that's what they had to do in the Upper
[55:43] Room Amen they had to lay aside every
[55:45] division every spirit everything that
[55:48] was against God and they got in one mind
[55:50] and one a court and the power of God
[55:52] fell upon them the Spirit of God fell in
[55:56] their lives
[55:56] hey that's what we're designed an
[55:58] evening like tabernacle we're not
[56:00] interested in just a service or just a
[56:02] church we're interested in the Spirit of
[56:04] God being in our midst
[56:06] we're interested in being our cars and
[56:08] being in our homes being in our lives
[56:10] being an every part that we have him in
[56:15] the world's got to get like this he
[56:18] meant so if the world is getting in the
[56:20] spirit
[56:21] what's the bride doing hey man we see
[56:24] the world fulfilling that they're
[56:26] getting into it you can see it on the
[56:27] outward appearance you you can see it
[56:29] and everything that they are and do and
[56:31] portray you can see it in our Congress
[56:34] they're getting in the spirit of
[56:36] destruction amen you can see Russia
[56:39] they're getting in the spirit a man of
[56:42] what's going to take place in the bombs
[56:43] that's going to fall it has happening

[56:48] it's going to take places prophecy
[56:50] there's nothing we can do to stop it
[56:52] there's not enough sermons we can do to
[56:54] stop it is going to take place but if
[56:57] they're getting in the spear
[56:58] and you're seeing lukewarmness and
[57:00] Laodicea and you're seeing the Sodom and
[57:02] Gomorrah conditions and the people in
[57:04] their place in the spirit how much more
[57:07] should we be in the Spirit of God amen
[57:09] the holy ghosts in our lives and the
[57:12] Holy Ghost moving and changing us and
[57:14] the Holy Ghost saving our young people
[57:16] and the Holy Ghost saving our marriages
[57:19] amen when all hell does against them
[57:21] there is a power that can save those
[57:23] things let's see we got to get in the
[57:28] spirit of it the world's got to get like
[57:31] this God would be unjust to Poor's wrath
[57:34] out opponent just people they have
[57:37] ignored him and walked away and Satan's
[57:39] captured them hey man that can happen
[57:42] right here in this service two people
[57:45] can ignore him and walk away and sit and
[57:47] capture them until they're soaked bound
[57:50] by spirit and you don't know if they're
[57:52] ever get loose from that thing they're
[57:54] there and they're there standing at that
[57:55] time but God has provided a way of
[57:58] escape how many wants to know the way of
[58:02] escape from the spirit of this world by
[58:05] being born again by receiving his spirit
[58:10] that's how you can escape the spirit of
[58:12] this world the spirit of this world is
[58:14] very strong Amen I'm not here to try to
[58:17] act like it's nothing it's a strong
[58:19] spirit one of the strongest spirits has
[58:21] ever been on this earth is this last day
[58:24] spirit it takes me and it takes women
[58:27] listen this spirit don't even care if
[58:29] you believe the message as long as you
[58:31] don't grab a hold of certain things it's
[58:35] a strong spirit mercy I I get amazed as
[58:41] we go along it just grieves me I'm
[58:45] telling my grieved I think brother Tim
[58:47] made reference this the other day but
[58:49] you hear it more and more people in the
[58:52] message becoming pro-choice they're not
[58:56] in the message or well the message is
[58:59] not in them hey man they might have a
[59:03] profession they might have a dress they
[59:06] might have an action or whatever as far
[59:08] as just their outward appearance but
[59:10] something's lacking on the inside
[59:12] of them it's impossible to believe that
[59:15] and be a Christian
[59:16] much less a minute message believer a
[59:22] man and I you know it's I just say
[59:25] that's not the only spirit that's
[59:26] prevalent we have the other spirits that
[59:28] are prevalent this art world as a spirit
[59:31] now that's trying to take over young
[59:32] minds as they're pushing it on
[59:35] everything through all kinds of news and
[59:37] all kinds of media and everything you
[59:39] know trying to get their ideas and it's
[59:42] washing away washing away washing away
[59:45] ain't meant to where people are now amen
[59:47] and message peers becoming vegans when
[59:51] the Bible axis absolutely calls it what
[59:54] it is
[59:55] amen he came down and showed Peter don't
[59:58] call what I call clean don't call it
[1:00:00] unclean
[1:00:01] he said slay and eat but that's the
[1:00:03] spirit
[1:00:04] a man it's not the spirit of this
[1:00:05] message it's not the spirit of this
[1:00:07] prophet it's not the spirit of the Holy
[1:00:09] Ghost
[1:00:10] it's a Laodicean spirit and we take that
[1:00:14] thing into our self and before we know
[1:00:17] it we're swamp right into the whole
[1:00:19] thing it's becoming more and more
[1:00:23] prevalent in message ranks why because
[1:00:25] they've listened to another spirit hey
[1:00:28] man revelations he says here in
[1:00:31] revelations 15 3 it says and they sang a
[1:00:34] song a memo I haven't skipped a little
[1:00:37] bit let me go back says he says right
[1:00:39] here we've got to get in the spirit of
[1:00:41] the last days when the spirit when this
[1:00:44] last days are here he says you go to a
[1:00:46] dance hall you go to get in the spirit
[1:00:48] of dancing or they won't or they won't
[1:00:50] dance you go to church you got to get in
[1:00:52] the spirit of worship before you can
[1:00:54] worship the world's got to get in the
[1:00:56] spirit of the last days before the last
[1:00:58] days can come and we're in the spirit of
[1:01:00] the last days and God promised that in
[1:01:03] these things would be here and that's
[1:01:05] what we got and men or women are sitting
[1:01:08] asleep and don't realize it we don't
[1:01:11] realize how late we're in a men I have
[1:01:13] been coming out of this pulpit of the
[1:01:15] token of the of the Exodus listen what's
[1:01:18] the time we're
[1:01:19] in him a man about 400 years went by but
[1:01:24] finally somebody got in the spirit of an
[1:01:26] exodus I believe those are people here
[1:01:29] tonight they're in the spirit amen not
[1:01:31] available to see it but in a spirit of
[1:01:33] leaving here this world is not my home
[1:01:36] I'm just passing through I'm a stranger
[1:01:39] I'm a foreigner here this is not what I
[1:01:42] want anymore
[1:01:43] I'm looking for another place amen in
[1:01:50] revelations 15 3 it says they sang the
[1:01:53] song of Moses the servant of God and the
[1:01:55] song of the lamb saying great and
[1:01:57] marvellous so that works Lord God
[1:02:00] Almighty just and true that ways thou
[1:02:02] king of saints do you see it the lamb
[1:02:05] the high priest holding his blood as an
[1:02:07] atonement on the mercy seat for our sins
[1:02:09] is the Lord God Almighty that's his
[1:02:12] present office that is what he's doing
[1:02:14] now pleading his blood for our sins but
[1:02:17] one day the lamb will become Lion of the
[1:02:19] tribe of Judah he will come forth and
[1:02:21] power and glory and take his authority
[1:02:24] to reign as king he is the coming king
[1:02:26] of this earth of course that does not
[1:02:28] say he's not our King now for he is our
[1:02:30] King king of saints but right now it is
[1:02:33] a spiritual Kingdom it is not of this
[1:02:36] world system even as we are not of this
[1:02:40] world
[1:02:41] hallelujah the reason we act different
[1:02:44] from the world our citizenship is of
[1:02:47] heaven we reflect the spirit of the
[1:02:50] world of our rebirth where Jesus is King
[1:02:53] whoo hallelujah that is where our spirit
[1:02:57] is reacting reflecting is not of this
[1:02:59] world it's not of the things of this
[1:03:01] world it's not of the Creed's of this
[1:03:03] world it's not of the world but for the
[1:03:05] thoughts of this world it is reflecting
[1:03:08] another Kingdom that is coming upon the
[1:03:10] earth he said that is why women don't
[1:03:15] not dress the men's clothes or cut their
[1:03:17] hair or use all these cosmetics or other
[1:03:20] things that's well that ought to cover
[1:03:22] everything some people say when you say
[1:03:23] makeup well hanga cosmetics and all of
[1:03:25] the things that the world likes so much
[1:03:27] the world likes so much
[1:03:30] the world likes so much the world likes
[1:03:33] so much why is it in our ranks because
[1:03:40] all of them that were in Israel we're
[1:03:43] not of Israel you're not of us until
[1:03:47] you're born of the same spirit hey man
[1:03:51] this is why our men don't drink in the
[1:03:54] smoke and carry on and sin our Dominion
[1:03:57] is the dominion over sin and it is
[1:03:59] enforce to the power that is in the
[1:04:02] Spirit of Christ that indwells us each
[1:04:05] Kingdom on earth is going to be torn
[1:04:07] down but ours will remain hallelujah
[1:04:11] ours will remain that's why you would
[1:04:14] say in Romans 8 verse 1 there is
[1:04:16] therefore no condemnation to them which
[1:04:18] are in Christ Jesus who walk not after
[1:04:21] the flesh but after the spirit amen for
[1:04:24] the law of the spirit of life is Christ
[1:04:26] Jesus has made me free from the law of
[1:04:28] sin and death and what the law could not
[1:04:31] do in that it was weak through the flesh
[1:04:33] God sending his own son in the likeness
[1:04:36] of sinful flesh and for sin condemned
[1:04:39] sin in this flesh and the righteousness
[1:04:41] of the law might be fulfilled who walk
[1:04:43] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:04:45] for they they're after the flesh do mind
[1:04:48] the things of the flesh oh yes they that
[1:04:52] are other spirit of this world mind the
[1:04:55] things of this world but they that are
[1:04:56] after spirit amen the spirit of Christ
[1:04:59] that they are they do mind the things of
[1:05:02] the Spirit for to be carnally minded is
[1:05:04] death but to be spiritually minded is
[1:05:07] life and peace because carnal mind is
[1:05:10] enmity against God for it's not subject
[1:05:13] to the law neither can it indeed can it
[1:05:15] be the so then they that are in the
[1:05:17] flesh cannot please God but ye are not
[1:05:21] in the flesh am I talking to anybody
[1:05:24] tonight but ye are not in the flesh but
[1:05:28] in the spirit if so be that the Spirit
[1:05:30] of God dwell in you now if any man have
[1:05:35] not the Spirit of Christ he's none of
[1:05:38] his
[1:05:39] so he was saying like this in a prayer
[1:05:42] Oh God
[1:05:43] in the name of Jesus Christ saturate
[1:05:47] this building with your spirit Oh Oh God
[1:05:57] in the name of Jesus Christ saturate
[1:06:00] this building with your spirit throw
[1:06:02] every chunk out throw every log out may
[1:06:07] the God of heaven filled with the Holy
[1:06:10] Ghost and set this church of fire well
[1:06:14] how many can say man so get in the
[1:06:17] spirit of this meeting and every one of
[1:06:20] you will be healed in the name of Jesus
[1:06:22] Christ mercy
[1:06:25] there it is hallelujah do believe it are
[1:06:27] you in the spirit of receiving I think
[1:06:32] that's my problem any times we wonder
[1:06:34] why some services are so high and some
[1:06:36] are so low because some would come with
[1:06:38] the spirit of receiving and some we come
[1:06:41] with another spirit somewhere our minds
[1:06:43] are all somewhere we got tomorrow we got
[1:06:45] this but if we can just tune in for this
[1:06:47] next 45 minutes an hour and a half five
[1:06:50] hours whatever God wants to do hey man
[1:06:54] let's let him be gone amen let's let him
[1:06:57] direct about whatever it is but I want
[1:07:00] to be in the spirit of receiving you can
[1:07:04] never received anything from God until
[1:07:06] you receive his spirit and you say God I
[1:07:09] want to be ready for you when you come
[1:07:11] and it comes in the most odd times he
[1:07:15] comes when you're not expecting it he
[1:07:17] comes when you're not feeling it he
[1:07:18] comes when the right when everything
[1:07:20] seems all hell broke loose against you
[1:07:22] gotta come on the sea but you better be
[1:07:25] ready to say Here I am Lord
[1:07:29] Alleluia revelations 1 and verse 10 said
[1:07:33] I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day
[1:07:35] and then there's another part and heard
[1:07:38] behind me a great voice as I was a hub
[1:07:42] as of a trumpet brother Branham says it
[1:07:45] like this I was in the spirit man how
[1:07:48] many could say I was in the spirit
[1:07:51] isn't that just beautiful my love that
[1:07:55] you could just call those words the
[1:07:58] whole of Christian life man I figured
[1:08:04] I'd get a little bit more a man's in
[1:08:05] there I was in the spirit he said you
[1:08:11] could call that those words the whole of
[1:08:14] Christian life if we were going to live
[1:08:18] as Christians we have to be in his
[1:08:20] spirit amen John was not talking about
[1:08:24] being in his own spirit that would not
[1:08:26] have brought these visions it had to be
[1:08:28] the Spirit of God it has to be the
[1:08:30] Spirit of God with us two or all our
[1:08:33] efforts is in vain
[1:08:34] Paul said I pray in the spirit I sing in
[1:08:37] the spirit I live in the spirit I come
[1:08:40] to church in the spirit hallelujah if
[1:08:43] there's any good thing that will come to
[1:08:46] me it has to be revealed by the spirit
[1:08:48] confirmed by His Word and made manifest
[1:08:51] by the result since bears and surely as
[1:08:54] John needed to be in the spirit to
[1:08:56] receive those tremendous revelations
[1:08:58] fresh from Jesus we need to be in the
[1:09:00] spirit to understand the revelations
[1:09:03] that God has given us to live by in his
[1:09:06] word for it is the same spirit but
[1:09:09] that's the problem we got it mixed up we
[1:09:11] want the word we won't really nothing
[1:09:13] but intellectual ideas but if you're
[1:09:15] getting the spirit of it then it'll be
[1:09:17] true revelation don't on your heart look
[1:09:20] at it this way he says all too many
[1:09:22] times in the Bible where it says in acts
[1:09:24] 2:38 repent and be baptized every one of
[1:09:28] you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:09:30] remission of sins you shall how many
[1:09:32] could say shall shall receive the gift
[1:09:35] of the Holy Ghost and it just passes
[1:09:37] right on you don't see it if they saw it
[1:09:45] by getting in the spirit they would know
[1:09:48] that it would they would want to receive
[1:09:49] the Holy Spirit then they need to repent
[1:09:52] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:09:54] Jesus Christ and then God would be
[1:09:56] duty-bound to fulfill his word by
[1:09:59] filling them with the Holy Ghost
[1:10:01] never get in his spirit or it would
[1:10:04] happen to them exactly as the word says
[1:10:07] pray to God for revelation by his Spirit
[1:10:11] that's the first step get in the spirit
[1:10:14] not your human spirit but his spirit hey
[1:10:18] man let me just use another illustration
[1:10:20] suppose you need healing what does the
[1:10:23] word say well we've read it countless
[1:10:25] time but did not get into the spirit
[1:10:27] when reading it he's the Lord God who
[1:10:30] hears all my diseases by His stripes I
[1:10:33] am healed and we're so mechanical we can
[1:10:38] quote it we've quoted it for years till
[1:10:39] we got that like we said Sunday we got
[1:10:42] so much the mechanics that we become
[1:10:43] mechanical we can quote it we can quote
[1:10:46] it we can call it he says but what
[1:10:48] happened did you ask God for His Spirit
[1:10:50] to teach us the real truth of it he says
[1:10:54] if we did we would call the elders
[1:10:56] confess our sins be anointed and prayed
[1:10:58] for and that would be that Amen it might
[1:11:04] not come immediately but it's spit and
[1:11:06] it's in his spirit it's all over in his
[1:11:11] spirit it's all over hey man there is no
[1:11:14] other Court of Appeal God will fulfill
[1:11:16] his work all we need to get in the
[1:11:18] spirit and then the things will be done
[1:11:20] don't go through the acts first get in
[1:11:23] the spirit and then go through the acts
[1:11:27] you know that's what's wrong with our
[1:11:29] services sometimes we want to come to
[1:11:31] church then get in the spirit but we
[1:11:35] need to get in the spirit and then come
[1:11:37] to church amen we want the preachers of
[1:11:41] the song leader to sing then we'll get
[1:11:43] in the spirit no we need to get in the
[1:11:45] spirit and sing with the song leader we
[1:11:47] want the preacher to preach and then get
[1:11:49] in the spirit no we need to get in the
[1:11:51] spirit and let the preacher preach and
[1:11:53] say yes Lord I see what you're talking
[1:11:55] about
[1:11:56] I receive it in the name of Jesus
[1:11:59] hallelujah we have to do the add we got
[1:12:02] to get in the spirit first then go
[1:12:04] through the act
[1:12:07] hallelujah have you ever noticed how the
[1:12:09] world's getting in the spirit of things
[1:12:11] that are in the world have anybody
[1:12:12] noticed that I've been talking about it
[1:12:14] have anybody out there noticed it mercy
[1:12:18] they're getting some kind of spirit they
[1:12:21] walk out and they got all kinds of junk
[1:12:23] all over their noses all I can look is
[1:12:25] like man that had to hurt
[1:12:27] how no I still still got a hurt how they
[1:12:30] how they doing that and then all the
[1:12:32] tattoos and all the stuff they got
[1:12:34] purple hair this and that in the other
[1:12:36] what is it they're getting into a spirit
[1:12:39] is this manifesting on them a man in it
[1:12:44] and you ain't got to tell them about it
[1:12:46] or tell them the shirt or shouldn't it
[1:12:47] just starts happening why because they
[1:12:50] received a spirit and that spirit starts
[1:12:52] acting out of their body starts
[1:12:54] overtaking it it's a spirit just like a
[1:12:57] cancer you know brother Brandon was far
[1:12:59] as I know in the first to begin to
[1:13:00] recall that what it was there wasn't a
[1:13:02] sickness it was a spirit and he would
[1:13:05] talk about he said that's a demon that's
[1:13:06] come there and anointed a cell he said
[1:13:09] but by the power of God we can cast that
[1:13:11] thing off anybody realized what it was
[1:13:13] it was a spirit hey man and it's the
[1:13:16] spirit that once ignored people do not
[1:13:18] receive anything from God when they come
[1:13:19] the house of God it's the spirit that
[1:13:21] wants to know people to do the things
[1:13:23] that are doing today it's a spirit
[1:13:25] that's trying to anoint you which spirit
[1:13:27] is it tonight hey man there's one
[1:13:30] there's a battle going on in this
[1:13:32] service we've called it it's a contest
[1:13:34] going on right now there's a new spirits
[1:13:37] that work in this service right now
[1:13:39] which one are you going to receive which
[1:13:41] one are you want to give yourself to
[1:13:43] which one are you going to yield
[1:13:44] yourself to if I was you I would yield
[1:13:47] myself to the Holy Ghost and let the
[1:13:50] Holy Ghost salt on you let him move on
[1:13:52] you let him reveal it to you I think I
[1:13:55] can preach I can stream I could holler I
[1:13:57] could read quotes I could read
[1:13:59] scriptures but if the Holy Ghost don't
[1:14:01] come in this place it's all forward it's
[1:14:03] all no it's nothing to it but I believe
[1:14:05] he is here and I believe with all my
[1:14:08] heart
[1:14:09] there's are people to receive him
[1:14:11] hallelujah but people are in the spirit
[1:14:16] they go to their ball games and sporting
[1:14:17] events and dances they enter into the
[1:14:20] spirit of it a man they don't sit a wall
[1:14:26] fires an old dried up sticks they enter
[1:14:30] right into the feel of things and become
[1:14:32] a part of things you can see them before
[1:14:34] you even get to the stadium miles
[1:14:37] hundreds of miles these flags have been
[1:14:39] going all kinds of stuff written all
[1:14:42] over the cars go this go that whatever
[1:14:44] they're going after do this win big do
[1:14:46] this test state state and it ain't just
[1:14:49] colleges or anything it's Little League
[1:14:50] it's all kinds of stuff they're getting
[1:14:52] in the spirit of something hey man you
[1:14:57] can get into the spirit of a lot of
[1:14:58] things don't have to be just sports hey
[1:15:02] man okay they enter right into the field
[1:15:11] things to become part of things is that
[1:15:15] all I'll hate how they hate the
[1:15:16] Christians for getting into the spirit
[1:15:18] of God's Word they called us fanatics
[1:15:20] and holy rollers there's nothing they
[1:15:22] don't do to show their hatred and
[1:15:24] disapproval but ignore that amen you can
[1:15:28] expect it knowing where it's coming from
[1:15:29] just go on and get in the spirit of
[1:15:32] worship
[1:15:33] hey man brother branham ignore that just
[1:15:36] go and get in the spirit of worship
[1:15:38] because our spirit is clean it's fresh
[1:15:40] it's real it's sober and serious but
[1:15:42] nonetheless full of the joy of the Lord
[1:15:45] the Christian ought to be just as
[1:15:47] exuberant and full of his pleasure in
[1:15:49] the Lord as the world is when it savers
[1:15:52] and delights in his present pleasures
[1:15:54] both Christians and the world were human
[1:15:56] both have emotion the differences
[1:15:59] Christians hearts and emotions are
[1:16:00] purely on Lord of glory and his love
[1:16:03] while the world satisfies the flesh amen
[1:16:10] I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day
[1:16:14] the first thing you have to do is what
[1:16:18] there you go somebody's listening get in
[1:16:21] the spirit
[1:16:22] how these houses revelation is going to
[1:16:25] ever come to you get in the spirit how
[1:16:30] you're ever going to get the Holy Ghost
[1:16:33] hey man it ain't a dried confession
[1:16:36] it ain't a preacher beating you on the
[1:16:38] back and a preacher praying for you it's
[1:16:42] you I got to get I got to be longing
[1:16:44] inside of your heart greater than the
[1:16:46] things of this world greater than what
[1:16:48] you have when you go back to your
[1:16:49] bedroom or to your house or do your car
[1:16:51] it's got to be a greater desire hey man
[1:16:57] he says listen he says what happens that
[1:17:00] when you was a sinner and you went to a
[1:17:02] dance you got in the spirit of it you
[1:17:06] started clapping your hands and patting
[1:17:08] your feet and shin digging no shin
[1:17:12] digging at in other words he was getting
[1:17:14] way down if he was digging your shins in
[1:17:17] throwing your hat on the floor going
[1:17:20] around around acting silly so you was in
[1:17:23] the spirit of it could you imagine a
[1:17:25] fella that was a dance team go to a
[1:17:28] dance and say well I guess y'all are
[1:17:29] having a pretty good time I suppose he's
[1:17:33] all they'd say all you want Wallflower
[1:17:35] get out of here get out of here you got
[1:17:39] a ball game somebody knock a whole road
[1:17:41] or something sit and look and say well
[1:17:43] guess that's pretty good no you wouldn't
[1:17:46] be a ball feel if you if you had that
[1:17:48] but you would be in the spirit of
[1:17:49] baseball when somebody knocks a hold on
[1:17:51] you raise up and holler
[1:17:53] my team's winning knock somebody's hat
[1:17:59] off his head nobody says a word about it
[1:18:02] but then in the church when you're
[1:18:04] getting the spirit and you begin to
[1:18:05] raise up and holler glory hallelujah
[1:18:08] praise God my team's waiting
[1:18:13] hallelujah
[1:18:14] my team's winners if God be for us who
[1:18:18] can be against us my team's winner no
[1:18:22] weapon formed against the shop husband
[1:18:24] my team's winner Amen somebody
[1:18:29] terrorists are you Holy Roller
[1:18:31] you hold her hold her he's I want to ask
[1:18:34] you a question if we're holy rollers
[1:18:36] because of what we do then that makes
[1:18:38] him unholy rollers I'd rather be a Holy
[1:18:41] Roller than an unholy Roller hallelujah
[1:18:44] John was in the spirit he got in the
[1:18:47] spirit then the things begin to take
[1:18:49] place
[1:18:50] he got enough spirit on the Lord's Day
[1:18:52] in other words his eyes turned from the
[1:18:55] old rotting I'll he was old and the
[1:18:57] teens he was going through in the
[1:18:59] scorpions and the snakes and all the
[1:19:01] problems around him he hauled his eyes
[1:19:03] faded away and all of a sudden he's
[1:19:05] standing in the Eternals Oh get in the
[1:19:12] spirit amen I believe that can happen
[1:19:16] for someone tonight it'll cause you to
[1:19:19] hear trumpet calls you to hear something
[1:19:23] hey man he was in the spirit and when he
[1:19:26] got there he heard a trumpet
[1:19:29] [Music]
[1:19:31] now trumpet always announces the
[1:19:33] approaching of something a king is
[1:19:35] coming they'll sound the trumpet and
[1:19:38] when Jesus approached she sounded the
[1:19:40] trumpet when Joseph went forth they
[1:19:42] sounded the trumpet now something's
[1:19:44] coming forward John got in the spirit
[1:19:46] and he heard a trumpet he heard a
[1:19:47] trumpet he took a look behind him and
[1:19:49] that but it was after he got in the
[1:19:51] spirit maybe he was dancing jumping
[1:19:54] running all over that aisle he was
[1:19:56] having a good time but he was in the
[1:19:58] spirit on the Lord's Day he wasn't
[1:20:01] running and jumping because amen there
[1:20:03] was a bunch of stones and scorpions and
[1:20:05] snakes like some of you would run and
[1:20:07] jump that one why he was running and
[1:20:08] jumping he was running and jumping
[1:20:10] because he was seeing things that wasn't
[1:20:12] in this dimension no more he was seeing
[1:20:14] the same God he had promised that would
[1:20:17] come again
[1:20:18] and he saw the one that was once was
[1:20:20] dead
[1:20:21] but it's not alive forevermore he saw
[1:20:23] the one who raised up from the grave and
[1:20:26] he saw he still lives today
[1:20:28] he saw the one that has cinder and he
[1:20:31] saw he still lives today he's I believe
[1:20:40] he's having a good time in the spirit
[1:20:42] just praising God because that's exactly
[1:20:46] what happened when the spirit fell on
[1:20:48] them in the first place when the Holy
[1:20:52] Ghost fell on them they staggered like
[1:20:54] drunk men and women and acted like they
[1:20:57] was drunk jabberin carried on like that
[1:20:59] two people said these people are full of
[1:21:01] new wine that's the way they acted the
[1:21:04] first time so the spirit come on again
[1:21:06] he'll act the same way the next time so
[1:21:13] what we need is a drunk Church hey man
[1:21:18] there's a well there's a woman out there
[1:21:20] drunk on the sins she's drunk of the
[1:21:26] wine of her fornication she's getting in
[1:21:29] the spirit of it she's gonna move into
[1:21:32] her power she's getting into the spirit
[1:21:34] of it but there's also another woman on
[1:21:36] this earth that's drunk but any of whom
[1:21:39] fornications and sins and idolatry and
[1:21:41] lukewarm spirits she's drunk on the Holy
[1:21:43] Ghost and she can see things make man
[1:21:46] that's happening and going home she's
[1:21:48] not worried about the bombs dropping
[1:21:49] because the bomb eat for her she's not
[1:21:51] worried about anything that's going on
[1:21:53] in political realms because there really
[1:21:54] ain't about her she's getting out of
[1:21:56] here man if you can get in your mind
[1:22:00] that in just a few days we're leaving
[1:22:02] this place what a shopping time we can
[1:22:05] have if we can get you away from the
[1:22:08] things that's going on in your life and
[1:22:09] the scorpions and the snakes is trying
[1:22:11] to bite you and trying to come at you
[1:22:13] and trying to hold at your windows if
[1:22:15] you can get in the spirit long enough to
[1:22:17] realize I only have a few more days left
[1:22:20] I only have just a few more birthdays
[1:22:23] here few more weeks few more year
[1:22:25] whatever it is it's just a limited time
[1:22:29] hallelujah but that makes me want a
[1:22:32] shell because I know and at the same
[1:22:34] time my time is not limited I'm leaving
[1:22:37] here but there is a limited time for

[1:22:40] that's snake and that scorpion that
[1:22:42] tormented Jonalyn honor it's gone and
[1:22:45] dead and ain't there no more but John
[1:22:47] stealing the Eternals hallelujah let's
[1:22:51] see little depression that thing that's
[1:22:53] holding you and trying to keep you bound

[1:23:09] things you try to torment you if you can
[1:23:12] get in the spirit right now you can see
[1:23:14] that your enemy is already dead he's
[1:23:18] powerless he has no power over here he
[1:23:21] has lost his power hallelujah if that's
[1:23:30] the way they acted the first time he'll
[1:23:32] do it again the second time the third
[1:23:34] time the fourth time get in the spirit
[1:23:47] but he says beloved remember you the
[1:23:50] words which is spoken before of the
[1:23:53] apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ how
[1:23:56] that they told you they should be
[1:23:58] mockers in the last time you know what
[1:24:02] that tells me those markers have their
[1:24:05] last time who should walk up there only
[1:24:10] their own ungodly lusts they have their
[1:24:14] own last time these be they who separate
[1:24:18] themselves sensual having to do
[1:24:21] with the flesh physical having not the
[1:24:24] spirit but he beloved building up
[1:24:27] yourself on the most holy faith praying
[1:24:29] in the Holy Ghost praying in the spirit
[1:24:33] keep yourselves in the love of God
[1:24:35] looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
[1:24:37] Christ unto eternal life but he told us
[1:24:42] he said that Christ in the true church
[1:24:45] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[1:24:48] but the book of Revelation shows how
[1:24:52] that Antichrist spirit would come into
[1:24:54] the church and defile it make it
[1:24:56] lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes
[1:25:00] Satan revealing his works the attempted
[1:25:03] destruction of God's fellow them and the
[1:25:06] attempted destruction that means he's
[1:25:08] not going to he going to attempt but
[1:25:10] he's not going to succeed he's gonna
[1:25:14] attempt to keep the Holy Ghost from me
[1:25:16] but he ain't going to succeed he's going
[1:25:18] to attempt to keep the healing off of
[1:25:20] him but he's not going to succeed he's
[1:25:23] going to attempt to keep your children
[1:25:24] bound and out there in sin
[1:25:26] but he's not going to succeed we're
[1:25:29] leaving here we're leaving a hoof behind
[1:25:32] if he did it the first time he'll do it
[1:25:35] the second time hey man but sea-fight
[1:25:38] said he can't stand it he knows that the
[1:25:41] people get the true revelation of the
[1:25:43] true church and what she is and what she
[1:25:45] stands for that she can do the greater
[1:25:48] works she will be an invincible army
[1:25:51] whoa hallelu how many believes that an
[1:25:54] invincible army if they get the true
[1:25:57] revelation of the two spirits within the
[1:26:00] framework of the Christian to all now
[1:26:03] we're bringing it on down I thought it
[1:26:04] was the world no it's right in the
[1:26:06] church well you think we're crying out
[1:26:11] against these things because then we
[1:26:14] wouldn't be worried about it there's so
[1:26:15] much out there in the world but it's in
[1:26:18] the church why did Paul deal with the
[1:26:21] things he dealt with not because it was
[1:26:23] in the world he dealt with it because it
[1:26:24] was in the church why are they preaching
[1:26:30] it because it's in the church why are
[1:26:32] they screaming out I guess because it's
[1:26:34] in the church should be in the church
[1:26:37] but it's in the church the two spirits
[1:26:40] within the framework of the Christian
[1:26:41] Church and by God's Spirit that's all
[1:26:44] the way you gonna have true determines
[1:26:45] by his
[1:26:46] spirit deserving and withstand the
[1:26:48] Antichrist spirit Satan will be
[1:26:51] powerless before her he will yes the
[1:26:54] definitely thwarted or defeated today as
[1:26:57] when Christ was stood his every effort
[1:26:59] to gain power for him in the desert
[1:27:01] Satan hates Revelation so it's Satan
[1:27:05] knows it takes the spirit to bring
[1:27:07] revelation so what is he doing in this
[1:27:10] hour he's trying to kill the spirit
[1:27:13] because he knows the word can come as
[1:27:15] far as idle man's mouth but if the
[1:27:17] spirit think there it can't bring life
[1:27:22] there's nothing the letter killeth but
[1:27:24] the spirit bring his life it takes both
[1:27:26] of them together but we can follow these
[1:27:33] two spirits in the church started as we
[1:27:36] said we can enable both worshipers both
[1:27:41] raising their hands on a Wednesday or
[1:27:42] Sunday having a sacrifice one relying on
[1:27:48] what they had done what they've done
[1:27:51] over here and I've done this and it's me
[1:27:53] it's I look what I've done God one able
[1:27:59] saying I ain't worthy there's nothing I
[1:28:02] got this worthy I can't do it it's
[1:28:07] impossible he comes all of a sudden out
[1:28:11] of the other canyons canes over here and
[1:28:14] he's got his man the most beautiful
[1:28:16] fruits he's worked hard he didn't do it
[1:28:20] hey brother I don't say he done it for
[1:28:23] God he worked his own works and they
[1:28:26] placed him just so beautifully on altar
[1:28:28] all those in here I've heard him I know
[1:28:36] what they sound like
[1:28:38] especially when one gets caught I said
[1:28:42] all of a sudden Abel had a revelation by
[1:28:44] the spirit he said he got him some kind
[1:28:47] of twine something he had maybe old vine
[1:28:49] and he put around his neck he comes
[1:28:51] dragging it up to his altar he's come
[1:28:54] bringing it up there and he laid it upon
[1:28:56] that altar
[1:28:58] Kenny looked over he's like wow
[1:28:59] in the world is going on you're able
[1:29:01] realize it has to be blood he got a
[1:29:05] revelation of what took to get them
[1:29:07] covered in the garden him and that God
[1:29:09] didn't slay him it was blood fig leaves
[1:29:12] didn't do it
[1:29:12] if flipping legs wouldn't do it tomatoes
[1:29:15] and grapes and everything else wasn't
[1:29:17] gonna do it it took blood and here Abel
[1:29:20] comes and brings it up there he looks
[1:29:22] around he finds him a rock and he just
[1:29:24] begins hacking at his throat glam crying
[1:29:27] out but round sad Lamba getting to speak
[1:29:30] in tongues he said just as our lamb said
[1:29:32] yeah the bustin I hear is he said blood
[1:29:41] begin to flow it begin to squirt all
[1:29:43] over him he said what happened Abel died
[1:29:46] with his sacrifice he died right there
[1:29:50] on his altar and that's where you gotta
[1:29:52] get brother the sister you got to be
[1:29:54] willing to die kill your own spirit kill
[1:29:58] your own thinking kill what you thought
[1:30:00] was right what you thought was wrong lay
[1:30:02] it all at the altar so you can get in
[1:30:04] the right spirit he saw in Jacob what
[1:30:14] was it one one of the birthright one
[1:30:17] despised the birthright Moses and Janus
[1:30:20] and Jambres all the way down to Judas
[1:30:22] and Jesus are those two spirits working
[1:30:25] all the way down through the church he
[1:30:27] said brother I'm said have you ever
[1:30:28] studied the history of revivals he said
[1:30:31] a revival signifies a move of God and
[1:30:33] power and every time God moves Satan is
[1:30:36] there to move also it never fails in the
[1:30:39] days of the what great Welsh revival
[1:30:40] most people don't know this but the
[1:30:42] insane asylums filled up quickly it was
[1:30:45] a great display of devil power to take
[1:30:47] away they're trying to take away the
[1:30:48] attention from God hello somebody then
[1:30:54] why are we surprised when they show up
[1:30:55] at a god field camp I'm gonna take the
[1:30:58] attention away from God it is written
[1:31:02] that Wesley's day the people would do
[1:31:04] most peculiar things that were
[1:31:07] definitely of Satan to try to mark the
[1:31:09] goodness
[1:31:10] power in Luther's day has said that the
[1:31:13] miracle of his ministry did not lie in
[1:31:15] the fact that he was successfully
[1:31:17] protesting the Roman Catholic Church but
[1:31:19] the method miracle lay in the fact he
[1:31:22] could and did stay sound insane amidst
[1:31:25] the fanatics who were often filled with
[1:31:27] and guided by wrong spirits and if you
[1:31:33] have been aware in this last day's
[1:31:35] ministry you'll have noted the same
[1:31:37] invasion of false and wicked spirits
[1:31:42] while we got so many doctors in the
[1:31:44] message because of false and wicked
[1:31:47] spirits it has to be that way now hope
[1:31:51] and trust your spiritual minded enough
[1:31:54] to get that and capitalize on it this is
[1:32:00] just to seal the point of the true and
[1:32:02] false vines the two seeds mingling and
[1:32:04] demonstrating the two spirits enter work
[1:32:07] let us look at first John 4:1 and for
[1:32:09] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[1:32:12] the spirits whether they of God because
[1:32:14] many false prophets are going out into
[1:32:16] the world hereby know ye or the Spirit
[1:32:19] of God every spirit that confesses that
[1:32:21] Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of
[1:32:24] God a man and every spirit that
[1:32:28] confesses not that Jesus Christ has come
[1:32:31] in the flesh is not of God and this is
[1:32:33] that spirit of Antichrist wherever
[1:32:35] you've heard that it should come and
[1:32:37] even now already is in the world but
[1:32:41] year of God little children and have
[1:32:43] overcome them the Antichrist spirit
[1:32:45] because greater is he God's Spirit
[1:32:48] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:32:51] world Jude 3 4 and 12 says beloved when
[1:32:55] I gave all diligence to write unto you
[1:32:57] the complet common salvation it was
[1:32:59] needful me to write to you and exhort
[1:33:01] you that you should earnestly contend
[1:33:03] for the faith that was once delivered
[1:33:05] unto the Saints we got to be doing the
[1:33:08] same thing contending for the faith we
[1:33:12] have been brought back to the original
[1:33:14] church and we got to stand there and
[1:33:17] contend for it
[1:33:19] and
[1:33:20] fight for it's our god-given rights it's
[1:33:23] our god-given right for our young people
[1:33:25] to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:33:27] how dare some plan create a creed that
[1:33:29] are taken out of the church it is our
[1:33:34] god-given rights our heritage he said
[1:33:41] for there certain men he says not Saints
[1:33:44] crept in unawares those have not come
[1:33:49] into the fold by means of the door they
[1:33:54] got in another way they didn't come by
[1:33:57] the new birth they come a different way
[1:34:02] and therefore they're robbers they try
[1:34:06] to take out the worship they take out
[1:34:08] the blood they take out the atonement
[1:34:10] they take out the intercessor they take
[1:34:12] it out they're robbers why because they
[1:34:14] didn't come in the same door we who were
[1:34:22] before of old ordained to this
[1:34:24] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[1:34:27] grace of our God into lasciviousness
[1:34:29] denying the whole each Lord God and our
[1:34:32] Lord Jesus Christ these are spots in
[1:34:34] your feasts of charity when they feast
[1:34:37] with you feeding themselves without fear
[1:34:39] it cannot be denied in the face of these
[1:34:42] scriptures that the true church and the
[1:34:45] false church are intertwined and have
[1:34:47] been planted together but of different
[1:34:49] seeds is it all elective God beware
[1:34:54] study closely be careful work out your
[1:34:56] salvation with fear and trembling rely
[1:34:59] on God and be strong in his mind your
[1:35:01] adversary the devil is even now going
[1:35:03] about like a roaring lion seeking whom
[1:35:05] he may devour
[1:35:08] watching the prayer be steadfast this is
[1:35:11] the end time both the true and false
[1:35:13] vines are coming into maturity but
[1:35:16] before the wheat matures those ripened
[1:35:18] tears must be bound for the burning and
[1:35:22] their joining the World Council of
[1:35:24] Churches that's the vine and soon the
[1:35:26] garden of the we will come but right now
[1:35:28] the two spirits are
[1:35:29] into vines but come out from among the
[1:35:32] tears start to overcome that which you
[1:35:35] may consider praise whether if our Lord
[1:35:37] and be fit to reign and rule with him
[1:35:43] listen there's the age this age is the
[1:35:49] last of the seven churches well
[1:35:53] beginning the first or the Ephesian age
[1:35:55] must and will come to fruition and
[1:35:57] harvest in the last or Laodicean age so
[1:36:03] what I read it puts the harvest in the
[1:36:05] Laodicean age the two vines will yield
[1:36:08] their final fruit the two spirits will
[1:36:11] terminate their manifestations in each
[1:36:14] of their final destinations who the
[1:36:18] sowing the water the growing is over the
[1:36:21] summers in earth it ended in a sickle is
[1:36:23] now thrust into the harvest he says
[1:36:26] which we said we've studied lots of
[1:36:28] pictures of the ripe and false vine fall
[1:36:31] spirit for church people I know that
[1:36:33] works that thou art neither cold nor hot
[1:36:35] I would that word cold or hot so that
[1:36:38] because our lukewarm neither cold nor
[1:36:39] hot I will spew thee out of my mouth
[1:36:41] because I say us I'm rich and increased
[1:36:44] with Goods and have need of nothing and
[1:36:46] knowest not that thou art wretched and
[1:36:47] miserable and poor and blind and naked I
[1:36:51] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:36:53] the fire that that made us be rich white
[1:36:56] raiment that means be clothed that the
[1:36:57] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[1:37:00] anoint the eyes with I self that they
[1:37:02] may see no words ever spelled out a more
[1:37:05] bitter denunciation and no proud and
[1:37:08] arrogant religious people ever deserved
[1:37:10] it milk yet in verse 21 same age to him
[1:37:20] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[1:37:28] me and my throne y'all have been
[1:37:31] commissioned to be thrown sitters
[1:37:34] a man to have dominion and reign as
[1:37:37] kings and priests even as I overcame and
[1:37:40] sat down and my father and his throne
[1:37:42] you'ii find the true vine he just said
[1:37:46] it the true vine the true spirit the
[1:37:48] true church people exalted to the very
[1:37:51] throne of God with the highest
[1:37:53] compliment ever paid to a humble
[1:37:56] steadfast spiritual group so if we're
[1:38:02] not that who was it I am that that is my
[1:38:07] promise hallelujah amen the mysteries of
[1:38:13] the tear and wheat in Matthew 13:24 is
[1:38:17] now also fulfilled another parable put
[1:38:19] forth with him saying the kingdom of
[1:38:20] heaven is likened unto a man who sowed a
[1:38:23] good seed in his field but while men
[1:38:25] slept his enemy came and sword tears
[1:38:27] into the among the wheat and went his
[1:38:29] way and when the blade was sprung up and
[1:38:32] brought forth fruit then appeared the
[1:38:33] tares also so the servants of the
[1:38:35] household come and said sir did it sound
[1:38:37] so good seeding that field from whence
[1:38:39] hath the tears come from he said an
[1:38:41] enemy has done this the said it wilt
[1:38:44] thou then go and gather them up he said
[1:38:46] nay lest while you gather up the tares
[1:38:49] you root up the wheat with and why
[1:38:51] because in that stage they both look the
[1:38:53] same but your little mature and the
[1:39:01] spirit that's in there is going to
[1:39:03] manifest their final destination the
[1:39:09] final destination will be the end I'll
[1:39:12] drop the mic on who the bride of Christ
[1:39:14] is a man that's what is going to be and
[1:39:21] then others will be cast out into
[1:39:23] wailing and gnashing of teeth but from
[1:39:27] the latter stage they've grown side by
[1:39:29] side and this ages are harvested what
[1:39:33] now I see us set out to accomplish has
[1:39:34] finally come to pass with all the might
[1:39:37] of the organization the false church
[1:39:38] turns away from the vestige of truth
[1:39:40] with political might reinforces herself
[1:39:43] with state back and sets out to
[1:39:45] eradicate forever the true believer
[1:39:48] just when she's about to accomplish her
[1:39:50] cowardly plot the wheat has gathered
[1:39:53] into the garner hallelujah no longer
[1:39:57] will the wheat and tares grow side by
[1:39:59] side no longer with a tear to receive
[1:40:01] the blessing of God because of the
[1:40:03] presence of the wheat for the wheat will
[1:40:05] be gone and the wrath of God will be
[1:40:07] poured out amen which were in in the
[1:40:10] utter destruction of the wicked he said
[1:40:12] I said not long ago about the false vine
[1:40:14] coming to full fruition in this age her
[1:40:17] fruit would mature and ripen that's
[1:40:19] correct the evil spirit of church full
[1:40:22] of iniquity will be revealed as a
[1:40:25] mustard seed that grew into a tree which
[1:40:27] large the fowls of the air at her head
[1:40:30] will be the Antichrist the mystery of
[1:40:32] iniquity all this is true and if this is
[1:40:34] true then must be also true that the
[1:40:37] bride church will mature her ripeness
[1:40:39] shall be the identification with her
[1:40:42] Lord by the means of the word in her
[1:40:44] head who will come for her in the
[1:40:46] mystery of godliness witches indeed
[1:40:48] cries and as the false church was all
[1:40:50] cut honest and diabolical power made a
[1:40:52] political force physical force and
[1:40:54] demons of darkness will come against
[1:40:57] this true vine and this true vine with
[1:40:59] the fullness of the Spirit and the word
[1:41:02] will do the very acts of the power that
[1:41:05] Jesus did then as she nears her head so
[1:41:08] becoming like him through the word Jesus
[1:41:10] will become the bride and the groom may
[1:41:13] be forever United as one when in the
[1:41:17] rapture
[1:41:31] but in Revelations 322 he says he that
[1:41:36] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:41:40] capitalist spirit saith unto the
[1:41:43] churches can you hear what the Spirit is
[1:41:47] saying get under the blood get the token
[1:41:54] receive Christ don't receive just a
[1:41:57] doctrine a creature a way of living
[1:42:00] receive him serves we should see Jesus
[1:42:06] that's what we want to see this is the
[1:42:10] last warning he says there not be
[1:42:12] another the throne room has been set up
[1:42:15] the twelve foundations have been laid
[1:42:17] think of this just leave
[1:42:21] 17500 highway 371 for a moment the
[1:42:27] streets of gold have been paved the
[1:42:30] gates of gigantic pearls are raised in
[1:42:33] hinge like a pyramid she stands so fair
[1:42:36] and glorious the heavenly beings who
[1:42:39] have prepared her watch breathlessly as
[1:42:42] she glistens and shines with a glory
[1:42:44] that is unearthly every facet of her
[1:42:47] being tell Beauty tells a story of
[1:42:49] amazing grace in Jesus love she's a city
[1:42:53] prepared for a prepared people who got
[1:43:02] their lamps trimmed and clear got the
[1:43:05] blood on the door she waits only for her
[1:43:08] inhabitants and soon they will throng
[1:43:12] her streets with joy yes it's the last
[1:43:16] call the spirit will not speak in
[1:43:19] another age the ages are over what the
[1:43:23] ages is over but but thank God at this
[1:43:27] moment the age is not over he is yet
[1:43:31] crying and his cries not only in the
[1:43:33] spirit its cries not only in the
[1:43:35] spiritual ears of men by a spirit once
[1:43:37] again a prophet is in the land once more
[1:43:40] God will reveal the truth as he did to
[1:43:42] Paul in the days of the seventh
[1:43:44] messenger in the days of the Laodicean
[1:43:46] age and it's messenger will reveal the
[1:43:48] mysteries of God as revealed to Paul -
[1:43:52] Paul he will speak out and those who
[1:43:54] receive that prophet well in his own
[1:43:56] name will receive the beneficent effect
[1:43:59] of that prophecy ministry and they that
[1:44:01] hear him will be blessed and become part
[1:44:04] of that bride of the last day who are
[1:44:06] mentioned in revelation 22:17 the spirit
[1:44:09] and the bride say come the court of weed
[1:44:12] the bride we that fell on the ground at
[1:44:14] nazia has come back to original word
[1:44:17] drain again
[1:44:18] praise God forever yes listen to the
[1:44:22] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[1:44:24] in this lesson what he says from God the
[1:44:27] bride will say hello somebody what he
[1:44:31] says from God the bride will say if
[1:44:34] they're saying something that the
[1:44:35] Prophet didn't say it ain't the Spirit
[1:44:37] of God and the spirit and the Prophet
[1:44:42] and the bride will be saying the same
[1:44:45] thing hallelujah and what they will say
[1:44:50] will have already been said in the word
[1:44:54] do you see all the checks and balances
[1:44:56] that have been given to us in this
[1:44:58] message but how many people just run
[1:45:00] right over and get one little quote in a
[1:45:03] quiet place place it over here with
[1:45:04] another and they get another lease
[1:45:06] places together but he said the spit of
[1:45:08] the Spirit of will be set on the bride
[1:45:11] and the Prophet where then the Spirit
[1:45:13] will be saying the same thing and then
[1:45:16] he makes another statement and what they
[1:45:18] say the word will have been saying Eva's
[1:45:21] have said if you can't find it in the
[1:45:23] word you can't find it in the message it
[1:45:25] ain't the word hey man you might can
[1:45:32] find it on tape but if it ain't in the
[1:45:34] Bible it ain't the message
[1:45:39] hey man this is what the message came to
[1:45:44] reveal it can't reveal anything outside
[1:45:47] this book he that hath an ear let him
[1:45:52] hear what the Spirit says the Spirit has
[1:45:56] spoken the Setting Sun is about to fade
[1:45:58] into eternity for the church age then it
[1:46:01] will be all over then it'll be too late
[1:46:04] to come if somewhere in this books of
[1:46:07] this series God has dealt with you
[1:46:09] brothers may even now turn to him in
[1:46:11] repentance and give all your life to him
[1:46:14] that by his Spirit he may give you
[1:46:16] eternal life he that hath an ear let him
[1:46:21] hear what the Spirit says if that spirit
[1:46:26] is saying something that's not in the
[1:46:28] Bible he ain't the right spirit it's the
[1:46:32] spirit of a man or the spirit of a devil
[1:46:34] that's taking him whatever but it ain't
[1:46:35] the Spirit of God because God will never
[1:46:38] never never deny his word what do you
[1:46:44] say those are some of those things you
[1:46:46] said we're Laodicean spirits how do you
[1:46:48] know that that's what it is because it's
[1:46:50] against the Word of God but he that hath
[1:46:55] an ear let him hear I mean he's got to
[1:46:58] ear tonight I'm thankful I got to hear
[1:47:01] ear to hear what the Spirit says this
[1:47:04] bar

[1:50:32] that your Holy Ghost so just fall upon
[1:50:34] our lives or that you just take and burn
[1:50:38] out the old dross and the unleavened out
[1:50:40] of our lives Lord

[1:50:43] our hearts and blow out all the
[1:50:45] dirtiness and all the dark places Lord
[1:50:47] and all the spirits are trying to hold
[1:50:49] skeletons and clauses made us all be
