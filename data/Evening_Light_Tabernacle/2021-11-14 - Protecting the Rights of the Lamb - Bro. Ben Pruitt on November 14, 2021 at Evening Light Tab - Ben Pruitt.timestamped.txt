[56:17] had a good time yesterday i know they
[56:19] were trying to feed me and embarrass me
[56:21] today because i wouldn't be able to
[56:22] preach after i ate that much but
[56:24] but it didn't happen we're here
[56:27] the presence of the lord is here he said

[56:33] got we got that
[56:35] we got that done this morning amen
[56:37] amen
[56:38] revelations chapter 5
[56:41] and verse 1 i saw in the right hand of
[56:43] him that said on the throne a book
[56:45] written within and on the backside
[56:46] sealed with seven seals
[56:49] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[56:51] with a loud voice who was worthy to open
[56:54] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[56:56] and no man in heaven nor in earth
[56:59] neither under the earth was able to open
[57:01] the book neither to look thereon and i
[57:04] wept much
[57:05] because no man was found worthy to open
[57:07] and to read the book neither to look
[57:08] there on and one of the elders said unto
[57:11] me weep not
[57:12] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[57:15] the root of david hath prevailed to open
[57:18] the book he fought the battle aren't you
[57:20] glad for that
[57:21] he had prevailed to open the book and to
[57:23] loose the seven seals thereof and i
[57:25] beheld and low in the midst of the
[57:27] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[57:29] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[57:32] had been
[57:33] slain i want you to notice this having
[57:36] seven horns
[57:37] and seven eyes which are the seven
[57:40] spirits of god sent forth into all the
[57:42] earth and he came and took the book out
[57:44] of the right hand of him
[57:46] that set
[57:47] upon the throne i pray the lord would
[57:49] add his blessing to the word this
[57:51] morning he may be seated
[57:56] i want to speak to you this morning on
[57:59] protecting the rights
[58:01] of the lamb
[58:05] everybody thinks they have rights today
[58:07] we live in an age of rights
[58:10] laodicea was the age of people's rights
[58:14] that's what the name means
[58:15] today we have people's rights human
[58:17] rights
[58:18] gay rights women's rights animal rights
[58:22] i read in one place where a court
[58:24] declared that an orangutan in argentina
[58:27] had rights
[58:28] he had the right to be free it was the
[58:30] worst day of that orangutan's life
[58:34] because once you let him go what's he
[58:35] going to do he's used to being fed
[58:38] we have a dog at home that has thinks he
[58:40] has rights he's got more rights than i
[58:41] do
[58:43] he'll get off the couch and
[58:45] and and he gets babied and gets fed
[58:47] doesn't have to work don't have to do
[58:48] anything to provide it
[58:50] but you know
[58:52] we all have we all think we have rights
[58:54] but i want to tell you this morning i
[58:56] guess this this message came to me as i
[58:59] was studying on the breach and
[59:01] things brother branham said about that
[59:02] and i'm getting tired of people telling
[59:05] me
[59:06] that we don't have the right
[59:08] because it's not our right that we're
[59:09] protecting well you don't have the right
[59:12] to worship god you don't have the right
[59:14] to pray for the baptism of the holy
[59:16] ghost you don't have the right to preach
[59:18] the right to to have church and and to
[59:20] really love god with all your heart and
[59:22] and to be on fire for god you don't have
[59:24] the right to do that i'm tired of
[59:26] hearing that because i'm not here this
[59:28] morning defending the rights of a man
[59:31] but i'm here this morning defending the
[59:33] rights of the lamb
[59:36] that's what we're to do is to protect
[59:38] his rights so brother adam tells us that
[59:40] laodicea is the people's rights or
[59:43] justice of the peoples and he talked
[59:45] about that that
[59:47] church age that has seen nations rising
[59:50] up and demanding equality socially and
[59:53] financially he said this is the age of
[59:55] the communists and we've seen that
[59:57] haven't we this is the age of the
[59:59] communists where all men are supposedly
[1:00:01] equal but only in theory
[1:00:04] and and so he talked about liberal
[1:00:06] theologians that said that jesus was a
[1:00:08] socialist and
[1:00:10] and the early church practiced socialism
[1:00:12] and we ought to do that today but it's
[1:00:14] it's an illusion of rights
[1:00:17] that people have today and
[1:00:19] and actually what they get is their
[1:00:20] rights taken away from them
[1:00:23] but brother adam goes on to say in every
[1:00:25] attribute ancient laodicea is found
[1:00:27] reborn
[1:00:28] in the in the laodicean age and i
[1:00:31] believe we can see that today everybody
[1:00:33] thinks they have rights but i don't
[1:00:34] think everybody understands what rights
[1:00:37] are that's right
[1:00:39] what is a right
[1:00:40] a right is a legal social or ethical
[1:00:43] principle of freedom
[1:00:45] or entitlement it's something that that
[1:00:48] you have that is allowed to you or owed
[1:00:51] to you according to either a legal
[1:00:54] system or perhaps because of just who
[1:00:56] you are
[1:00:57] in fact in our country we have certain
[1:01:00] rights that are given to us as citizens
[1:01:02] and
[1:01:02] and it was jefferson thomas jefferson
[1:01:04] who said we hold these truths to be
[1:01:06] self-evident that all men are created
[1:01:08] equal that they are endowed by their
[1:01:10] creator with certain unalienable rights
[1:01:13] it's an important phrase because it
[1:01:15] means that right can't be taken away
[1:01:18] that if a government tries to take away
[1:01:21] an unalienable right it means
[1:01:23] that the government is wrong
[1:01:25] and that government should be abolished
[1:01:27] and so we have rights in what he said
[1:01:30] was to life liberty and the pursuit of
[1:01:32] happiness
[1:01:33] and that government is created we form
[1:01:36] governments to protect those rights
[1:01:39] but when the government goes to infringe
[1:01:41] on those rights he went on to argue that
[1:01:43] if government failed to protect those
[1:01:45] rights that it should be abolished
[1:01:48] now let me just say this at the outset
[1:01:50] this morning any church system
[1:01:53] that fails to protect the right
[1:01:56] of the land
[1:01:58] that fails to protect what he died for
[1:02:01] he died so you and i could be here this
[1:02:03] morning he died for somebody who would
[1:02:06] who would love him with all of his heart
[1:02:08] somebody that would worship him with all
[1:02:11] that they had somebody that would preach
[1:02:13] the truth somebody that would live it in
[1:02:15] an age that has gone crazy he died for
[1:02:18] somebody and he bought those rights for
[1:02:21] you and i
[1:02:22] i want to stand for his rights today
[1:02:28] are you with me this morning
[1:02:30] i want to stand for his rights
[1:02:32] amen look any church system that fails
[1:02:36] to protect that should be abolished
[1:02:40] that's the strong statement but it's the
[1:02:42] truth
[1:02:43] there are legal rights
[1:02:45] in america we have the bill of rights a
[1:02:46] legal right is a right that's written
[1:02:48] down
[1:02:50] and and we they've agreed and made it
[1:02:51] law that it should be the right of the
[1:02:53] land in america we have the bill of
[1:02:55] rights and what they did in the
[1:02:56] constitution is they limited what the
[1:02:58] government could do
[1:02:59] but then in the bill of rights they said
[1:03:01] that's not enough the early
[1:03:03] founding fathers realized that that was
[1:03:04] not enough that there had to be rights
[1:03:06] beyond that that there would be a
[1:03:08] right to
[1:03:10] actually that would be
[1:03:12] would be told us that we would know what
[1:03:14] our rights are and so they specified
[1:03:16] certain things that we could have and
[1:03:18] certain things that could not be done to
[1:03:20] us and i'm thankful for those rights
[1:03:22] today because the very first one is
[1:03:24] freedom of religion
[1:03:26] the government shall not infringe
[1:03:28] on the right of the people
[1:03:30] and so it goes on down and and goes
[1:03:32] through the first ten amendments there
[1:03:34] you can find all kinds of different
[1:03:36] rights now think about it what would you
[1:03:38] do
[1:03:39] if someone's come and begin to take one
[1:03:41] of those rights away
[1:03:43] now many of you hunt
[1:03:45] maybe not people that are here this
[1:03:46] morning maybe they're out hunting but
[1:03:51] but if you're streaming today in the
[1:03:53] deer stand many people hunt
[1:03:56] this weekend is the first weekend of
[1:03:58] hunting season in arkansas
[1:04:00] if you didn't know that
[1:04:01] and and so i know that people do that
[1:04:04] what if they took you right away
[1:04:07] to hunt
[1:04:08] how would you feel how would you respond
[1:04:10] to that i'll tell you how some of you
[1:04:11] would respond to that
[1:04:13] and you'd take up arms
[1:04:17] you'd march in the street
[1:04:19] you'd be on the picket line you'd pick
[1:04:20] up your sign and you say no i'm not
[1:04:23] gonna let you take my rights
[1:04:26] you'd show up to vote
[1:04:29] in person
[1:04:31] whether it was convenient or not
[1:04:34] oh i wish people realized what kind of a
[1:04:37] a right that we've been given as
[1:04:39] christians we ought to show up in the
[1:04:41] house of god to vote
[1:04:47] amen i'm going to stand for my right
[1:04:50] to have church i'm going to stand for my
[1:04:52] right to be a christian i don't i want
[1:04:54] my children i want to be able to pass
[1:04:56] those rights on to my children the ones
[1:04:58] that if the lord carries another 20
[1:05:00] years i want them to know what the
[1:05:02] presence of god is like i want them to
[1:05:04] know what the spirit of god tell the
[1:05:06] people i want them to hear the word
[1:05:08] clearly i want them to know what having
[1:05:10] a pastor is like what being in a real
[1:05:12] church is like
[1:05:14] and i'm tired of people telling us that
[1:05:16] that's that we're just standing for our
[1:05:17] rights no it's god's rights
[1:05:20] written in the word for us
[1:05:27] y'all going to kill me this morning
[1:05:32] now you have a legal right
[1:05:34] written down
[1:05:36] brother branham says this way to
[1:05:38] everything that jesus
[1:05:40] died for
[1:05:41] [Applause]
[1:05:47] he said he died his death there at the
[1:05:48] cross and gave his life that you might
[1:05:51] have the legal rights
[1:05:53] for every redemptive
[1:05:55] blessing
[1:05:57] john sees a bloody lamb
[1:06:00] in revelation chapter five
[1:06:03] but he sees he sees a bloody lamb but
[1:06:05] not a defenseless lamb
[1:06:08] a lamb who has seven horns
[1:06:11] and seven eyes
[1:06:13] and brother branham tells us that the
[1:06:14] seven horns are the seven church ages
[1:06:17] and the seven eyes are the seven
[1:06:19] messengers
[1:06:21] and he says that in the breach he said
[1:06:22] the seven horns was the seven churches
[1:06:24] the seven church ages he said because
[1:06:27] that was the lamb's protection
[1:06:31] oh my another place he calls it the
[1:06:33] power
[1:06:35] and that was the lamb's protection what
[1:06:37] he protected his rights with
[1:06:40] on earth
[1:06:41] that's a that's a strange name you think
[1:06:42] of a lamb as meek and mild and he was
[1:06:45] but he but he has rights and he protects
[1:06:47] those rights
[1:06:49] hallelujah aren't you glad for a bloody
[1:06:51] lamb
[1:06:52] aren't you glad for a lamb that that
[1:06:54] still has mercy
[1:06:56] amen on those that will reach out for it
[1:06:58] on those who will call for it there's
[1:07:00] still mercy for you today i don't care
[1:07:02] what you've done or where you've been or
[1:07:04] what kind of a past you've had there's
[1:07:06] still mercy there for you there's still
[1:07:08] something that lamb is still bleeding
[1:07:10] john sees a bloody lamb the the one the
[1:07:13] elder turned around and said he said now
[1:07:15] he said i want you to see the lion of
[1:07:17] the tribe of judah have prevailed but
[1:07:19] when john looks
[1:07:22] hallelujah he saw a lamb bloody lamb
[1:07:25] one with mercy one with grace amen i'm
[1:07:29] so glad because i still need it every
[1:07:30] day
[1:07:31] i don't know about you but i still have
[1:07:33] to repent i still have to call out to
[1:07:35] god i still need his mercy i still need
[1:07:37] his healing power
[1:07:40] i still need that blood every day
[1:07:42] [Applause]
[1:07:44] what did he protect his rights with
[1:07:46] now watch it was the horns those seven
[1:07:48] church ages and brother branham put it
[1:07:50] this way he said what he protected his
[1:07:51] rights with on earth
[1:07:53] was a god-sent group of people
[1:07:59] especially because there's lots of
[1:08:01] people who've given up on the rights of
[1:08:03] the lamb
[1:08:04] who've taken away his rights
[1:08:07] who have formed denominations but
[1:08:09] there's got to be a special god-sent
[1:08:11] group of people that protect the horn on
[1:08:14] the lamb
[1:08:16] amen now
[1:08:18] what are these rights that the lamb has
[1:08:22] and and you know when you know what his
[1:08:23] rights are
[1:08:25] in order to know that
[1:08:27] you have to know who he is
[1:08:30] because he's not just another person
[1:08:34] but he has certain rights because of who
[1:08:36] he is just like you do today you have
[1:08:37] certain rights as an american citizen
[1:08:39] you have certain rights and and
[1:08:41] privileges because of the state and the
[1:08:43] place that you live in
[1:08:45] he has certain rights
[1:08:47] number one he is god
[1:08:49] amen
[1:08:51] now
[1:08:52] i think we could say amen to that today
[1:08:54] brother brown said when the virgin birth
[1:08:56] came on he said that was a paradox
[1:08:58] now that god in order to make himself
[1:09:00] known to man
[1:09:01] i'm so glad he wanted to make himself
[1:09:03] known
[1:09:04] he became man
[1:09:06] and he said how that god the great
[1:09:08] spirit he said god to me was before
[1:09:11] there wasn't even a lie there wasn't a
[1:09:12] media there wasn't an atom there wasn't
[1:09:14] a molecule there wasn't anything and
[1:09:16] everything was god he said that's how
[1:09:19] great he is
[1:09:21] he's from eternity through eternity
[1:09:23] don't lose your sense of the awesomeness
[1:09:25] of god of the greatness of god
[1:09:29] and in modern christianity they've
[1:09:31] broken down that sense of awesomeness we
[1:09:33] ought to when we come in the house of
[1:09:35] god we ought to get a sense that god is
[1:09:37] awesome that anything is possible
[1:09:40] because this is the almighty god that is
[1:09:42] able to perform what he promised he's
[1:09:45] able to do what he promised he would do
[1:09:48] not some dead god that died 50 years ago
[1:09:51] or 500 years ago but a god that is able
[1:09:54] a god that filled all time in space
[1:09:56] [Music]
[1:09:58] and brother madam says the thank
[1:10:00] god amen he said that's how great he is
[1:10:03] and that god he is from eternity through
[1:10:06] eternity he always was god he always
[1:10:09] will be god he said and how the greatest
[1:10:11] of all life
[1:10:12] now watch he said but that great god
[1:10:15] does he care about me this morning
[1:10:18] is there a thought in his heart towards
[1:10:19] me
[1:10:21] can he tell that i'm burdened
[1:10:23] can he tell that there's something going
[1:10:24] on in my life
[1:10:26] can he tell that i've made a mistake is
[1:10:29] is he listening is he watching but the
[1:10:31] brother said that great god the greatest
[1:10:33] of all life became a little small
[1:10:36] germ
[1:10:37] in the womb of a woman
[1:10:40] in order to take his own
[1:10:42] law
[1:10:45] that may not mean anything to you but
[1:10:47] that
[1:10:49] god
[1:10:50] who fills all time in space
[1:10:53] became a german
[1:10:55] in the womb of a woman in order to take
[1:10:58] his own law he didn't send a second
[1:11:00] person
[1:11:01] or a third person
[1:11:02] but he came down
[1:11:05] changed his mask
[1:11:09] hallelujah
[1:11:11] just going to have to stop and pray for
[1:11:13] a while
[1:11:15] doesn't it make you feel unworthy
[1:11:16] sometimes
[1:11:18] makes you feel that god would do that
[1:11:20] would come down be one of us
[1:11:22] who filled all space and time
[1:11:24] and god was manifested in the flesh
[1:11:27] how the great god of heaven changed his
[1:11:30] strain
[1:11:32] now if you watch the papers today
[1:11:33] especially here a few months ago when
[1:11:34] the delta strain come out of chronovirus
[1:11:36] you remember that
[1:11:38] if you go and watch that if you google
[1:11:40] change this strain you'll find you'll
[1:11:42] find articles about that that that there
[1:11:44] was actually the virus changed its
[1:11:46] strain
[1:11:47] to be something else
[1:11:49] brother brown said god changed his
[1:11:52] strain
[1:11:53] come from being god to be man
[1:11:56] through the virgin birth he said nobody
[1:11:58] can figure it out
[1:12:00] but see god he was the word and the word
[1:12:03] is the instructions from god i don't
[1:12:05] want to get too far into this this
[1:12:07] morning but you understand that god put
[1:12:09] something in his dna he was the word in
[1:12:11] his very being and and god that dna was
[1:12:15] manifested in the flesh it was it wasn't
[1:12:17] from man he didn't get it from his
[1:12:19] mother from his father on the earth he
[1:12:20] got it from god
[1:12:23] every bit of it come from god god was
[1:12:25] manifested in the flesh he changed his
[1:12:26] strain come from being god to be man
[1:12:28] through the virgin birth he said nobody
[1:12:30] can figure it out he said but science
[1:12:32] today can't tell you how that virgin
[1:12:34] birth was but god did it as he came
[1:12:36] he said no one was able everybo everyone
[1:12:38] was sexually born he said one man the
[1:12:41] same was the rest of them no one could
[1:12:42] help the other one we was all in trouble
[1:12:46] oh we could stop and preach there for a
[1:12:48] while
[1:12:48] we was all in trouble there's nothing
[1:12:50] worse than a self-righteous spirit
[1:12:53] we were all in trouble
[1:12:55] the worst sinner in simon's house the
[1:12:57] pharisees house was simon
[1:13:00] he didn't think that he was but he was
[1:13:02] actually the worst sinner in the house
[1:13:04] because when christ came in he refused
[1:13:06] to welcome him he refused to recognize
[1:13:09] him but a prostitute from outside she
[1:13:11] saw that there was something that needed
[1:13:13] to be done the lamb had a right to be
[1:13:15] worshipped the lamb had a right to have
[1:13:18] his feet washed the lamb had a right to
[1:13:20] be welcome in the house of god and
[1:13:22] because the lamb amen because he had a
[1:13:25] right she washed his feet she said i'm
[1:13:27] not worthy but she didn't look at who
[1:13:29] she was she took the money that she'd
[1:13:31] gotten through ill-gotten gains and come
[1:13:33] down to his feet and begin to wash his
[1:13:35] feet
[1:13:39] you talk about emotional she washed his
[1:13:40] feet with her tears
[1:13:42] how long has it been since you cried
[1:13:43] them kind of tears
[1:13:47] but jesus said because she'd been
[1:13:48] forgiven much
[1:13:50] [Music]
[1:13:51] i was raised on a church pew i was
[1:13:54] raised in the message
[1:13:55] but i've been forgiven much
[1:13:58] and and so when i come in his presence
[1:14:01] the tears begin to come because i know
[1:14:04] i've been forgiven much i know what i
[1:14:06] was i know what i could have been i know
[1:14:09] the dna that runs in my family
[1:14:11] even being a pruitt there's bad dna that
[1:14:13] runs in my side of it anyway there's
[1:14:15] some there's some stuff there that you
[1:14:17] don't want to know about but i know what
[1:14:19] he did for me i know what he kept me
[1:14:21] from i know hallelujah
[1:14:24] i wonder if you could say that today i
[1:14:26] know what he kept me from i know what
[1:14:28] the power of god had changed my life
[1:14:32] i know what god did i know who he is
[1:14:36] amen they can't talk you out of that
[1:14:40] amen you can't talk moses out of a
[1:14:42] burning bush
[1:14:45] amen
[1:14:47] amen
[1:14:50] you remember you remember when moses
[1:14:53] had the burning bush experience brother
[1:14:56] brown talks about that and i'm getting
[1:14:57] off my notes here but we'll come back in
[1:14:58] a minute y'all just got one service
[1:15:00] right
[1:15:02] we'll come back in a minute but but
[1:15:04] moses was here he was at the burning
[1:15:06] bush and brother branham says about that
[1:15:08] he said that he said actually preachers
[1:15:11] could come
[1:15:12] and steal your memory
[1:15:15] of the event
[1:15:19] how many remembers when god
[1:15:22] came and touched your life
[1:15:25] now look
[1:15:27] for some of you the details might get
[1:15:29] fuzzy especially if it's been a long
[1:15:30] time ago
[1:15:32] i've seen people who were unable in the
[1:15:34] grasp of their memory their mind didn't
[1:15:36] work like it used to
[1:15:37] but there was still something there
[1:15:40] you see brother random said they might
[1:15:41] be able to steal the memory of it but
[1:15:43] they can't steal the change
[1:15:52] we might tell you that you can't be born
[1:15:53] again they might tell you that you're no
[1:15:55] different they might tell you that it
[1:15:57] was just an emotional experience they
[1:15:59] might tell you that it wasn't nothing
[1:16:00] from god but i was there in a basement
[1:16:03] when god changed my life i was there in
[1:16:06] that room when he gave me the holy ghost
[1:16:09] i've been there i know what it's like to
[1:16:10] feel his power i know what it's like to
[1:16:12] have his word moving in my life i know
[1:16:15] what it is to be changed they may steal
[1:16:17] the memory i may not be able to tell it
[1:16:19] the same way twice but they can't steal
[1:16:22] the change
[1:16:25] they can't take that away from me
[1:16:28] hallelujah
[1:16:30] oh we might as well have church this
[1:16:32] morning amen we was all in trouble amen
[1:16:36] but god himself came down
[1:16:39] and was born not of a jew not of a
[1:16:41] gentile but his blood was god
[1:16:43] he said the blood comes from the male
[1:16:45] sex in this case it was god god the
[1:16:47] creator created the blood cell in the
[1:16:49] womb of mary and built himself a
[1:16:51] tabernacle that he himself came down and
[1:16:54] lived in it
[1:16:56] oh my
[1:16:58] the bread was praying in shalom he said
[1:17:00] we know that in a drama they change mass
[1:17:02] they come from one thing to another and
[1:17:04] that's what you did
[1:17:06] you come from the spirit god the great
[1:17:09] jehovah put on the mask of a human being
[1:17:13] changed your strain
[1:17:15] he said you pitched your tent
[1:17:18] hallelujah i'm so glad he picks his tent
[1:17:21] beside mine
[1:17:23] hey man you come down from god and
[1:17:25] became man that you might die to redeem
[1:17:28] man
[1:17:28] you changed
[1:17:30] your mask
[1:17:32] but it didn't stop there
[1:17:34] he said then again
[1:17:36] you've changed it
[1:17:38] and you've
[1:17:39] masked yourself
[1:17:41] into the people
[1:17:43] who will believe
[1:17:44] will you believe today
[1:17:47] you've masked yourself and that's who he
[1:17:48] protects his rights with is those who
[1:17:50] will believe and act out according to
[1:17:53] the word that that you have written
[1:17:56] here the bible says let this mind be in
[1:17:59] you which was also in christ jesus in
[1:18:01] philippians 5. he said who being in the
[1:18:04] form of god thought it not robbery to be
[1:18:06] equal with god
[1:18:08] but made himself
[1:18:10] of no reputation
[1:18:12] i got to thinking about that
[1:18:14] you know if i could create myself a life
[1:18:17] what kind of a life would i create
[1:18:19] i'd create myself more money for one
[1:18:24] i'd be a little taller have more hair
[1:18:34] i'd be able to eat what i wanted to
[1:18:37] never get sick
[1:18:40] be one of you skinny guys with lots of
[1:18:42] hair
[1:18:45] if i could create myself a body
[1:18:47] i'd come as a doctor or a lawyer with a
[1:18:50] family of a great name
[1:18:52] maybe not a lawyer but something else
[1:18:58] somebody's got a good name
[1:19:00] if i could create myself a body maybe
[1:19:02] i'd come as a pruitt
[1:19:07] you think about it
[1:19:09] what kind of a body would you create
[1:19:12] he created himself an everyday body
[1:19:15] a baby
[1:19:18] that had to be washed
[1:19:20] and taken care of and nurse at his
[1:19:21] mama's breast
[1:19:23] he didn't create himself a full-born man
[1:19:25] he didn't create himself some kind of
[1:19:27] superhuman but he created he made
[1:19:30] himself flesh
[1:19:32] and was born into a manger into a cave
[1:19:36] and into swaddling clothes there with
[1:19:39] with animals to witness his birth there
[1:19:42] was shepherds some men
[1:19:44] that would witness and tell the the
[1:19:45] people that he was born he was born into
[1:19:48] our world and that way he made himself
[1:19:50] of no reputation if i was coming i'd
[1:19:53] make myself a reputation better than the
[1:19:55] one i have now but when he came he
[1:19:57] actually made himself of no reputation
[1:20:01] and he said let this mind be in you
[1:20:04] which was in christ jesus being found in
[1:20:06] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[1:20:09] became obedient unto death even the
[1:20:11] death of the cross wherefore god also
[1:20:13] had highly exalted him and given him a
[1:20:15] name
[1:20:16] which is above every name
[1:20:19] that at the name of jesus every knee
[1:20:21] should bow
[1:20:22] or the things in heaven and things in
[1:20:24] earth and things under the earth i got
[1:20:26] to looking at that one day and brother
[1:20:27] branham said he said he said i'm
[1:20:29] standing here i'm not worthy to pray for
[1:20:31] the people but he said he gave me the
[1:20:33] rights to his name
[1:20:36] hallelujah he said as a christian
[1:20:40] not just as a prophet he gave you the
[1:20:41] rights
[1:20:43] to sign his name on a checkbook are you
[1:20:45] still with me this morning
[1:20:47] at the name of jesus every knee should
[1:20:49] bow things in heaven and things and
[1:20:51] earth things under the earth that every
[1:20:53] tongue should confess that jesus christ
[1:20:55] is lord to the glory of god the father
[1:20:56] he is god
[1:20:58] but he was also the second adam
[1:21:02] he's the son of god
[1:21:04] now look adam was the son of god
[1:21:07] we find that luke 3 38 he said he was
[1:21:09] the son of god
[1:21:10] adam was the son of god
[1:21:12] now brother random says we see something
[1:21:14] that was lost here because the bible
[1:21:16] said so that he said and in the book
[1:21:18] here that has redeemed us he said what
[1:21:20] are we redeemed from something we must
[1:21:21] have lost
[1:21:22] you see he had to come because he didn't
[1:21:25] come for himself the rights that the
[1:21:26] lamb has is the rights that we have
[1:21:30] that we possess but we couldn't get them
[1:21:33] we couldn't save ourselves
[1:21:35] but the lamb came
[1:21:38] lay the sight of splendor and came down
[1:21:41] condescended to come into our world and
[1:21:44] beat one of us and actually
[1:21:46] lose every right that he had
[1:21:49] to take on the rights of a man
[1:21:51] but you see he had the rights that adam
[1:21:53] lost
[1:21:54] and he come to buy them back for us
[1:21:57] now watch
[1:21:58] something we must have lost he said
[1:22:00] before you can be redeemed there must be
[1:22:01] something that redeemed us back and all
[1:22:03] the inheritance that we had has been
[1:22:05] redeemed back and we must have had
[1:22:06] something one time that we do not have
[1:22:08] now but this lamb come to redeem he said
[1:22:10] we had something that we was lost from
[1:22:13] he said notice what did we lose well it
[1:22:15] was given to adam to have eternal life
[1:22:18] that's right that's a right
[1:22:22] amen
[1:22:23] the right of eternal life adam had
[1:22:25] eternal life as long as he eat from the
[1:22:26] tree he had eternal life and we noticed
[1:22:28] again that adam would inherit the earth
[1:22:30] he was like an amateur god over the
[1:22:31] earth he said the earth was his
[1:22:33] everything was given unto his hand he
[1:22:34] could do with it whatever he wanted to
[1:22:36] he named it and called it done whatever
[1:22:38] he wanted to he was truly a son of god
[1:22:40] he said now in the fall adam forfeited
[1:22:42] the title deed to that he forfeited it
[1:22:44] to satan satan took the title deep he
[1:22:47] said adam was very southful
[1:22:49] and he did not redeem his rights
[1:22:51] for he could not redeem his rights i
[1:22:53] believe that can be said about all of us
[1:22:55] before our conversion before we were
[1:22:56] born again before we received the token
[1:22:58] of the holy ghost i believe it could be
[1:23:00] said that all of us were very thoughtful
[1:23:02] when you see people that are very
[1:23:04] slothful about the about the rights of
[1:23:06] the lamb they're very thoughtful about
[1:23:08] taking back what what the what god gave
[1:23:10] them you find
[1:23:12] many times just because they've never
[1:23:14] really come face to face with him
[1:23:15] they've never really had an experience
[1:23:17] with it because they're very thoughtful
[1:23:19] adam was very slothful and he could not
[1:23:21] redeem his rights but today the rights
[1:23:23] have already been redeemed you don't
[1:23:25] have to do it you have to benefit from
[1:23:27] it
[1:23:29] you get to benefit from it
[1:23:32] to do that you have to receive his
[1:23:33] spirit
[1:23:34] now watch
[1:23:36] he is the son of god he is the kinsman
[1:23:39] redeemer
[1:23:40] redemption was a right
[1:23:42] reserved to the near kinsman you see
[1:23:44] when you lost property in the old
[1:23:45] testament you lost every right that you
[1:23:47] had except one
[1:23:49] and the one right was reserved not in
[1:23:51] you but in the kinsman redeemer
[1:23:53] and that was the right of redemption
[1:23:56] you lost the rights to enjoy it you lost
[1:23:58] the rights to benefit from it to pull
[1:24:00] the produce off of it you lost the
[1:24:02] rights to sit under your vine and your
[1:24:03] fig tree to sit out there and like maybe
[1:24:06] you would be a hunter and you would hunt
[1:24:07] on the land but if you lose your rights
[1:24:08] to it you lose your right to hunt you
[1:24:10] lose your right to kill the land you
[1:24:11] lose your right to live on it but the
[1:24:13] right of redemption was still there but
[1:24:16] it was vested in the near kinsmen amen
[1:24:18] and jesus had to come with the rite of
[1:24:20] redemption you'll find that in jeremiah
[1:24:22] 32 7 that the rite of redemption goes to
[1:24:24] the near kinsman but the brahmana said
[1:24:26] that's the reason john wept he said
[1:24:28] because if no one could get that book
[1:24:30] all creation everything was gone she
[1:24:32] would just simply turn back to atoms and
[1:24:34] molecules and cosmic light not even be
[1:24:36] creation person nothing else he said
[1:24:38] because adam lost the rights of that
[1:24:40] book he forfeited it when he listened to
[1:24:42] his wife
[1:24:44] we'll just go on he said he forfeited it
[1:24:46] when he listens to his wife and she
[1:24:48] listens to satan's reasonings
[1:24:52] some of us need to listen to our wives
[1:24:53] more often
[1:24:55] praise god
[1:24:59] i gotta quit
[1:25:01] i get too comfortable i'll start getting
[1:25:03] a pastor mode that wouldn't be good we
[1:25:04] won't do that
[1:25:08] oh but look
[1:25:10] it couldn't go back he lost it
[1:25:12] it couldn't go back into the dirty hands
[1:25:14] of satan
[1:25:16] who tempted her out of the way
[1:25:18] so therefore it went back
[1:25:20] to the original owner
[1:25:22] he said like any abstract deed would do
[1:25:25] i spent 15 years in the abstract deed
[1:25:27] industry
[1:25:28] title insurance industry
[1:25:30] and i was always happy when we could
[1:25:32] find the original owner
[1:25:34] because sometimes you can't
[1:25:36] the records are just gone there's no way
[1:25:38] and if you cannot find the original
[1:25:40] owner then there's no way to get the
[1:25:43] property cleared up without doing some
[1:25:45] kind of major lawsuit to quiet the title
[1:25:48] because there's no way to run all the
[1:25:50] way back to the beginning but if you can
[1:25:52] find the original owner even if the
[1:25:54] original owner has died it goes on down
[1:25:56] through his relatives and there might be
[1:25:58] somebody living in some some other
[1:26:00] nation somewhere some other state
[1:26:02] somewhere that has the authority to sign
[1:26:04] a deed and they don't even know they
[1:26:05] have it because they got that they are
[1:26:07] the descendants of the original owner
[1:26:09] listen when the book was lost it goes
[1:26:11] back
[1:26:16] it goes back into the hands listen you
[1:26:19] may have been so lost you may have been
[1:26:21] a drunk you may have been a drug addict
[1:26:23] you may have been out beyond every hope
[1:26:25] of life at all you may have been in a
[1:26:27] place that you couldn't even see your
[1:26:28] way back from you may have thought you'd
[1:26:30] never come back to church but you were
[1:26:32] in the hands
[1:26:34] of the original owner
[1:26:36] even when you were backslid even when
[1:26:38] you weren't when you were against god
[1:26:40] when you were doing whatever it is that
[1:26:42] you wanted to do you were still in his
[1:26:44] hands you are never the elect of god is
[1:26:46] never out of his hands
[1:26:50] never out of his hands
[1:26:52] oh that ought to be a revelation to us
[1:26:54] this morning you are never out of his
[1:26:56] hands adam lost the rights but it did
[1:26:59] not go back just into the ether
[1:27:01] somewhere but it went back to the
[1:27:03] original hands of the owner satan didn't
[1:27:05] have the rights he was just a squatter
[1:27:06] but god almighty
[1:27:11] held it in his hands
[1:27:13] and the ownership was never lost
[1:27:16] amen there was a chain of possession
[1:27:18] from the almighty who become the lamb
[1:27:21] and he passed it to his hands
[1:27:24] amen
[1:27:25] you're still in his hands
[1:27:28] the same god that delivered you from sin
[1:27:30] that same god can heal you today
[1:27:33] that same god can bring revival to your
[1:27:35] heart to your spirit
[1:27:37] because you're in his hands
[1:27:40] amen
[1:27:41] the original owner means it's redeemable
[1:27:43] the rights are vested in the original
[1:27:45] owner
[1:27:46] now brother branham said there's a price
[1:27:47] and that's redemption there's some price
[1:27:49] for redemption because nobody could do
[1:27:50] it so he made his laws his own laws of
[1:27:52] the kingdom and redeemer he said then
[1:27:54] they could find nobody every man was
[1:27:55] born of sex born after sexual desire he
[1:27:58] was in the original sin satan and eve so
[1:28:00] he could not do it there's nothing in
[1:28:02] him no holy pope priest dr divinity
[1:28:04] whoever he might be he would be nobody
[1:28:06] worthy he couldn't be an angel because
[1:28:08] it had to be a kinsmen he had to be a
[1:28:09] man then god himself become a kinsman
[1:28:13] by taking on a human flesh through the
[1:28:14] virgin birth he shed his blood he said
[1:28:16] that wasn't the blood of a jew it wasn't
[1:28:18] the blood of a gentile it was the blood
[1:28:20] of god the bible said we're saved
[1:28:21] through the blood of god
[1:28:24] amen he purchased us that's what brother
[1:28:26] random gift says from the scripture paul
[1:28:28] says he purchased us with his own blood
[1:28:32] amen
[1:28:33] amen
[1:28:35] you see the rights of the lamb are
[1:28:36] adam's rights
[1:28:37] therefore they're your rights
[1:28:42] states your legal status in romans 8 16
[1:28:44] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:28:46] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:28:48] god let me know you're a child of god
[1:28:49] today
[1:28:50] i'm a son or daughter of god i've never
[1:28:53] been out of his hands
[1:28:55] amen and joint heirs he said if children
[1:28:57] then we're heirs paul uses the legal
[1:28:59] reasoning that if we're children then
[1:29:01] we're heirs by law by by legal we have
[1:29:04] legal rights to the promises where heirs
[1:29:06] of god join heirs with christ it will so
[1:29:08] be that we suffer with him and we may be
[1:29:10] also glorified together now notice so he
[1:29:13] not only had the rights of who he was
[1:29:14] i'm trying to hurry through this this
[1:29:16] morning you just bear with me i won't
[1:29:18] hold you very long i'll tell you i'm
[1:29:20] closing three times
[1:29:22] the third one is the charm
[1:29:25] but he said when he took the former man
[1:29:26] he took the rights of man not for
[1:29:28] himself but for us
[1:29:30] pretty bad
[1:29:31] now look again as we said we have a a
[1:29:33] bill of rights as americans but where is
[1:29:35] our rights
[1:29:37] right here
[1:29:39] as christians
[1:29:40] some of us need to read the bible
[1:29:44] and find out what we've been given
[1:29:48] you see you have a right as a christian
[1:29:50] to eternal life what that means is if
[1:29:52] you shouldn't if you've been born again
[1:29:54] if you haven't been born again you need
[1:29:56] to be born again you must be born again
[1:29:57] but if you're born again you shouldn't
[1:29:59] let the devil come in and beat you
[1:30:01] around what he's doing is working in
[1:30:03] your memory working in your conscience
[1:30:04] working in something else but he said if
[1:30:06] you're god is greater than your
[1:30:08] conscience he's greater than your heart
[1:30:10] he's able to come in and actually speak
[1:30:12] to you and reveal to you the word of god
[1:30:14] see many people have added so many
[1:30:16] things to the message of the hour that
[1:30:17] it becomes a burden that they themselves
[1:30:19] cannot bear and so they're actually
[1:30:21] under the burden of themselves but what
[1:30:23] you ought to do is find out what rights
[1:30:24] you have you have a right to eternal
[1:30:26] life
[1:30:28] [Applause]
[1:30:31] i don't care what the devil says why
[1:30:33] because john 10 28 he said i give unto
[1:30:35] them
[1:30:37] eternal life
[1:30:38] and we find out he said neither shall
[1:30:40] any man pluck them out of my hand titus
[1:30:42] 1 2 we find out that was always was he
[1:30:44] said in hope of eternal life that hope
[1:30:46] is expectation of eternal life which god
[1:30:48] that cannot lie do you believe he cannot
[1:30:50] lie this morning he cannot lie with that
[1:30:53] god that cannot lie promised before the
[1:30:55] world began
[1:30:57] amen
[1:30:59] the lamb was slain but he had a right to
[1:31:01] eternal life and he'd come up on the
[1:31:02] third day
[1:31:04] and gave that right back to us
[1:31:07] now look right all right to healing
[1:31:09] the bible says he heals all
[1:31:12] thy diseases
[1:31:14] tired of people telling me well you just
[1:31:16] want to go back to pentecost you want to
[1:31:17] be healed have a right to that
[1:31:20] and that's the lamb's right
[1:31:23] he paid for that
[1:31:25] they put stripes on his back
[1:31:28] i don't want to give that up meekly
[1:31:30] i don't want to walk away from that
[1:31:32] right to healing
[1:31:34] the lamb has that right
[1:31:37] amen notice he said he heals all thy
[1:31:41] diseases he redeems your life from
[1:31:42] destruction he crowns you with loving
[1:31:44] kindness and tender mercies he satisfies
[1:31:46] your mouth mouth with good things those
[1:31:48] are your rights
[1:31:51] it's time you stood up for your rights
[1:31:55] well but you know i got to make a living
[1:31:56] i got a right to make a living as a
[1:31:57] chris as an american but it's time you
[1:31:59] set up for your rights as a christian
[1:32:03] i got a right to be healed i'm going to
[1:32:04] show up until the symptoms go away
[1:32:07] i got a right to receive the holy ghost
[1:32:09] and i'm going to pray until until i've
[1:32:11] been changed
[1:32:12] i got a right to to worship god in the
[1:32:14] freedom without the burden of depression
[1:32:16] in my life without the burden of
[1:32:18] suicidal thoughts without the burden of
[1:32:21] besetting sin i've got a right to those
[1:32:23] things
[1:32:24] amen and i believe i've got a right and
[1:32:26] i'll be there at the throne of god until
[1:32:29] i realize my rights
[1:32:30] [Applause]
[1:32:34] the devil wants to take them away i'm
[1:32:36] going to protest you try to take rights
[1:32:37] away from a union what are they going to
[1:32:39] do they're going to stand there they're
[1:32:40] going to strike they're going to get out
[1:32:42] there and protest and everything else
[1:32:43] but they try to take the rights away
[1:32:45] from the people of god many times they
[1:32:46] sit there and say well it's okay it's
[1:32:48] just the age we live in no it's not it's
[1:32:50] not the age we live in it's time we
[1:32:52] stood up for our rights
[1:32:56] the problem is the age the problem is us
[1:32:59] i'll tell you what age we live in we
[1:33:00] live in what brother brown called the
[1:33:01] bride time the end of the way of seeing
[1:33:04] age but it's the bright time it's time
[1:33:05] for you and i to raise up and say hey
[1:33:07] it's my hour
[1:33:13] oh tired from that
[1:33:15] all the hay rides yesterday
[1:33:17] too much chilly
[1:33:19] bless god
[1:33:21] that i had a right to eat it i did too
[1:33:25] but today i'm going to stand for my
[1:33:26] rights to be in the house of god
[1:33:36] i heard of a lady who was
[1:33:38] who was deaf she couldn't hear nothing
[1:33:40] she kept going to church asked her said
[1:33:41] why why do you go she said well i just
[1:33:43] want the devil to know whose side i'm on
[1:33:45] [Music]
[1:33:45] [Applause]
[1:33:48] i may i'll get my child but i know you
[1:33:50] young mothers we got a bunch of them in
[1:33:51] our church that you know mothers that
[1:33:53] just seem like fight the babies the
[1:33:54] whole time in the nursery maybe some of
[1:33:56] you sitting in the nursery today and
[1:33:57] you're fighting that and you think i i
[1:33:58] haven't really sat in a church service
[1:34:00] in a long time but you got to write just
[1:34:02] like everybody else does to go to the
[1:34:04] house of god and god has a right to be
[1:34:06] worshipped from the nursery
[1:34:08] god has a right to be worshipped from
[1:34:10] the balcony he has a right to be worse
[1:34:12] not just from the front rows he's got a
[1:34:13] right to be worshipped by young people
[1:34:15] but he's got a right to be worshipped by
[1:34:17] old people he's got a right to be
[1:34:18] worshipped by preachers he's got a right
[1:34:20] amen
[1:34:22] he's got a right to amen
[1:34:24] he's got a right you never pass the age
[1:34:26] where god won't give you the right to
[1:34:28] healing the right to salvation amen
[1:34:31] amen
[1:34:32] amen
[1:34:34] brother branham said now he talked about
[1:34:35] healing he said here's the next thing i
[1:34:37] want to say is this he said don't wait
[1:34:38] for a healing campaign in your city to
[1:34:40] be healed
[1:34:41] listen to this he said your pastor or
[1:34:44] your neighbor
[1:34:45] that's a christian has just as much
[1:34:47] legal rights
[1:34:49] from god to pray for you as anybody on
[1:34:51] the face of the earth he said you don't
[1:34:53] have to wait till somebody comes along
[1:34:55] with a healing campaign he said those
[1:34:56] men just stimulate faith he said god
[1:34:58] never intended all these great campaigns
[1:35:00] sweeping across the nation he expected
[1:35:02] that to be in every church
[1:35:05] every pastor
[1:35:07] [Applause]
[1:35:10] hallelujah the bible says any sick among
[1:35:12] you let him call for the elders of the
[1:35:13] church but then pray over him anointing
[1:35:15] him with oil in the name of the lord the
[1:35:17] prayer of faith shall save the sick the
[1:35:18] lord shall raise him up and if he have
[1:35:20] committed sins they shall be forgiven
[1:35:21] him and real true christians down to the
[1:35:23] ages have stood for that right
[1:35:28] they were the power of god the horn the
[1:35:30] defense of the lamb and the age that
[1:35:32] they lived in
[1:35:33] stand for the right of healing you have
[1:35:34] a right to people the bible says there's
[1:35:36] peace that passes all understanding and
[1:35:38] it'll keep your hearts and minds through
[1:35:40] christ jesus you have a right to joy
[1:35:44] tired of people telling me to be a
[1:35:46] message believer you got to be miserable
[1:35:49] i've tried that it's not fun
[1:35:56] listen if you're miserable you're
[1:35:58] miserable it's just uh
[1:35:59] all you do is make yourself a twofold
[1:36:01] child of hell by prosecuting yourself to
[1:36:03] the message
[1:36:05] but you got a right to be
[1:36:08] joyful you gotta write the bible says
[1:36:11] that right goes all the way back you
[1:36:12] know we have created rights we have
[1:36:14] rights that as i said are inherent
[1:36:16] those rights go all the way back before
[1:36:17] time
[1:36:18] because the bible says the sons of god
[1:36:20] shouted together for joy
[1:36:24] that's right
[1:36:26] psalms 5 11 says let all those who put
[1:36:28] their trust in me how many trust him
[1:36:30] this morning
[1:36:31] and all those who put their trust and
[1:36:33] they rejoice let them ever shout for joy
[1:36:35] because thou defendeth them let them
[1:36:38] also that love thy name be joyful in
[1:36:40] thee psalms 32 11 be glad in the lord
[1:36:42] and rejoice you righteous shout for joy
[1:36:44] all you that are upright in heart psalms
[1:36:46] 132 16 i will clothe their priests with
[1:36:49] salvation heard saints shall shout aloud
[1:36:51] for joy
[1:36:53] brother branham says this he said when
[1:36:54] the great shepherd was smitten i know
[1:36:56] these are things that you know but i
[1:36:58] just want to include them here because
[1:36:59] we have the rights to these things
[1:37:01] he said when the great shepherd was
[1:37:03] submitting the great sheep prophet when
[1:37:04] he was smitten back there he said it is
[1:37:06] finished and that minute as soon as this
[1:37:08] shepherd was smitten it was over
[1:37:12] hallelujah
[1:37:13] sin is settled
[1:37:15] there was no more sin they were clean
[1:37:19] you believe it this morning the penalty
[1:37:21] was paid the believers whose names were
[1:37:23] written in the book of life predestined
[1:37:24] from the foundation of the world it was
[1:37:26] finished the very minute jesus said it
[1:37:28] was finished he said that great shepherd
[1:37:30] come for his sheep it was finished god's
[1:37:31] right hand was pulled from his bosom
[1:37:33] smitten
[1:37:34] then on easter he returned it a man
[1:37:36] raised it up again to his bosom and
[1:37:38] extended it down to you and i in the
[1:37:39] form of his word to redeem us back to
[1:37:42] the original garden from which sin took
[1:37:44] us from
[1:37:45] he said the hidden secret of his great
[1:37:46] heart was revealed by a prophet shepard
[1:37:48] it was revealed by a shepherd he said no
[1:37:50] wonder
[1:37:51] the mountains
[1:37:53] jumped and shouted on that day
[1:37:57] nobody understood it
[1:37:59] why would it happen why did the the
[1:38:01] mountains so why was there an earthquake
[1:38:03] why did the moon become blood and all
[1:38:05] those things and brother random at
[1:38:06] different times will say that he died
[1:38:08] until that happened and it was such a
[1:38:09] dreadful thing but here he says it was a
[1:38:11] joy he said they seen the prophet
[1:38:14] shepard he said no wonder he said the
[1:38:16] sun hit his face and screamed for joy
[1:38:19] no wonder all nature broke loose the
[1:38:20] wind shook the trees until they shook
[1:38:22] and shook enjoyed and jumped
[1:38:24] he said they'd seen the prophet shepherd
[1:38:26] on the mountain redeem every name in the
[1:38:27] book of life
[1:38:29] and they seen that their own nature was
[1:38:30] redeemed they screamed and jumped are
[1:38:32] you still with me this morning the world
[1:38:34] went into an earthquake the mountains
[1:38:35] rent the rocks fell out and the sun went
[1:38:37] down he said and everything taken place
[1:38:39] like any meeting he said when the
[1:38:41] shepherd reveals to you that it's
[1:38:43] finished
[1:38:44] [Applause]
[1:38:46] he said i've seen jumping spells and joy
[1:38:48] spells but there was nobody hurt
[1:38:50] and he typed that to that day he said
[1:38:51] there was the earthquake but no one was
[1:38:53] hurt
[1:38:54] he said i've seen it but no one was hurt
[1:38:56] he said they were free from the world it
[1:38:58] was revealed to the people that they
[1:38:59] were free from the world the things of
[1:39:00] the world and the joy of the lord filled
[1:39:02] the congregation i got a right to that
[1:39:04] man
[1:39:07] i got enough
[1:39:08] wet blankets
[1:39:12] i'm tired of wet blankets
[1:39:14] putting out every little spark
[1:39:18] are you with us where i know i'm
[1:39:19] preaching to the choir
[1:39:21] i'm tired of wet blankets but not every
[1:39:23] spot
[1:39:24] and sometimes it's me
[1:39:27] because my body don't feel like it
[1:39:31] said well man today i
[1:39:33] had a long day yesterday
[1:39:35] kind of sick and not feeling too good
[1:39:37] i'm trying not to get in your face today
[1:39:39] you know the lamb has a right
[1:39:44] listen he has a right to hear you speak
[1:39:45] his word
[1:39:47] he has a right to hear you say his name
[1:39:52] where did we ever get the idea that the
[1:39:53] only place you could pray in church was
[1:39:55] in front of the pulpit
[1:39:57] behind the pulpit
[1:40:00] he got a right to hear
[1:40:02] his name from your lips
[1:40:04] he said well the preacher says his name
[1:40:06] every sunday morning but he's got a
[1:40:07] right
[1:40:08] amen i want to give him what he deserves
[1:40:10] today
[1:40:12] and he's got a right to be for these
[1:40:14] things and that's our job is to protect
[1:40:15] these rights now brother branham said he
[1:40:17] never did see anything disorderly there
[1:40:19] was always right and order because
[1:40:20] they'd recognize that their name that
[1:40:22] had been written on lamb's book of life
[1:40:23] before the foundation of the world now
[1:40:25] how do we protect those rights well he
[1:40:28] told us in mark chapter 16 verse 15 he
[1:40:30] said unto them go into all the world and
[1:40:32] preach the gospel to every creature he
[1:40:34] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:40:36] saved he that believeth not shall be
[1:40:38] damned and these signs shall follow them
[1:40:39] that believe so he's telling you how his
[1:40:41] rights are going to be protected down to
[1:40:43] the church ages and if you look at those
[1:40:45] seven spirits of god that spirit of god
[1:40:47] he said is one spirit of god manifested
[1:40:49] in seven men but he said it doesn't
[1:40:51] change
[1:40:52] it's the exact same spirit at the end
[1:40:55] that it is at the beginning
[1:40:56] these signs shall follow them that
[1:40:58] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:40:59] devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:41:00] they shall take up serpents if they
[1:41:02] drink any deadly thing it won't hurt
[1:41:03] them they shall lay hands on the stick
[1:41:05] and they shall recover notice what the
[1:41:07] lamb does he goes back to his
[1:41:09] intercessory box he left his little
[1:41:11] group on the earth to protect his rights
[1:41:13] amen
[1:41:14] don't try to take those rights away
[1:41:18] look
[1:41:19] brother branham come in our hour and and
[1:41:22] he showed us that those rights had been
[1:41:24] restored what had been restored he said
[1:41:26] we had to write he said any group of
[1:41:28] people any gathering of holiness people
[1:41:30] that's people that live right
[1:41:34] that believe in christ
[1:41:36] has the right to have the nine spiritual
[1:41:39] gifts
[1:41:40] we have a right to the original man a
[1:41:42] brother random said the priest that on
[1:41:43] down through time had a right to have a
[1:41:45] taste yes
[1:41:47] hallelujah of here oh my oh as a
[1:41:50] preacher i want to have a taste of the
[1:41:52] original manna
[1:41:53] and i got a right to have a taste of
[1:41:55] that manna this morning
[1:41:58] amen
[1:41:59] he said worms couldn't get in it that's
[1:42:01] the problem with some people the worms
[1:42:02] have gotten their manner that's why they
[1:42:04] don't want to eat it
[1:42:05] but i gotta write to the original man
[1:42:08] amen and he said how beautiful it is he
[1:42:11] said on the day of pentecost when the
[1:42:12] holy ghost fell down from heaven our man
[1:42:15] after we come through the blood and have
[1:42:16] been saved and cleansed from our sins he
[1:42:18] said in the holy ghost fell brother he
[1:42:20] said peter said on the day of pentecost
[1:42:21] it's for you and for your children and
[1:42:23] for them that's far off even as many as
[1:42:25] the lord our god shall call and brother
[1:42:26] brown said this he said every person
[1:42:29] that enters into the baptism of the
[1:42:30] spirit can have the same kind of holy
[1:42:33] ghost that they got on the day of
[1:42:34] pentecost
[1:42:36] [Music]
[1:42:37] hallelujah
[1:42:39] brandon makes a statement that no man
[1:42:40] has a right to preach the gospel until
[1:42:42] he's met going to the backside of the
[1:42:43] desert i got a revelation one day that
[1:42:45] man i had a right to preach the gospel
[1:42:47] if i had met god on the backside of the
[1:42:48] desert and god called me to do it
[1:42:51] i i i would dare a man to try to take
[1:42:54] those rights away from the true church
[1:42:55] of god
[1:42:57] there's no right to do that
[1:42:59] i got a right to preach
[1:43:01] not because i'm worthy of it but because
[1:43:03] the lamb has rights
[1:43:06] if he wanted to set up church a certain
[1:43:07] way that's his
[1:43:08] right amen it's just my job to enforce
[1:43:11] it
[1:43:12] [Music]
[1:43:14] this is how we enforce our rights but
[1:43:15] the brandon said to restore it give me
[1:43:17] about five or ten more minutes and we're
[1:43:18] through that's my first warning to
[1:43:20] restore means to bring back or to
[1:43:22] restore he said a claim can be enforced
[1:43:24] now to bring back anything bring
[1:43:26] anything back to its rightful owner
[1:43:28] where it belongs he said therefore some
[1:43:30] way it went away from its rightful owner
[1:43:33] and can wander around anywhere
[1:43:36] and that's why you begin to have a mind
[1:43:37] battle you begin to think well if i was
[1:43:39] a christian i wouldn't have done that or
[1:43:41] if i was seed rather if i was the seed
[1:43:42] of god i wouldn't have done that you
[1:43:44] better be careful with that because look
[1:43:45] at some of the people jesus came to look
[1:43:47] at the woman at the well she's done some
[1:43:49] pretty bad things
[1:43:51] but she had representation in her heart
[1:43:54] brother brandon said when that wanders
[1:43:55] away from its rightful owner it can
[1:43:57] wander around anywhere
[1:43:59] but to restore is to bring it back to
[1:44:01] real who really owns it
[1:44:03] hey man aren't you glad you've been
[1:44:05] restored back to the person to the
[1:44:07] original owner who really owns you
[1:44:09] to bring it back to its natural estate
[1:44:11] where it wasn't the first time bring it
[1:44:13] back into its natural condition he said
[1:44:15] in order to do this we have a right to
[1:44:17] enforce
[1:44:18] if there's a law to enforce this
[1:44:20] rightful condition of restoration
[1:44:25] there's a right in our bill of rights
[1:44:27] called the habeas corpus
[1:44:29] it's let us have the body
[1:44:31] what it means is that you have a right
[1:44:33] to a speedy trial
[1:44:34] someone come down there and caught you
[1:44:36] poaching deer
[1:44:38] fishing fishing without a license
[1:44:41] some i know you would never do anything
[1:44:42] else but those are common message sins
[1:44:44] you know
[1:44:48] let's thought i'd cover all of you this
[1:44:49] morning
[1:44:52] so we don't like to pay for licenses you
[1:44:54] know
[1:44:56] but here
[1:44:58] if he caught you like that and the game
[1:45:00] warden grabbed hold of you he says i got
[1:45:01] a jail cell for you
[1:45:03] he said
[1:45:04] there's a fine for this but i'm just
[1:45:05] going to throw you in the prison throw
[1:45:07] you into jail he goes down there and he
[1:45:08] throws you in jail locks the door and
[1:45:10] walks away
[1:45:11] what would you do
[1:45:13] well the man had a gun
[1:45:15] wasn't right to shoot him
[1:45:18] but he locked you up now look he's took
[1:45:20] away all your rights he's got you locked
[1:45:22] up in prison but there's a law there's a
[1:45:24] bill of rights that says he can't keep
[1:45:26] the body
[1:45:27] without presenting it before the judge
[1:45:35] don't you see where the church ages were
[1:45:37] yeah don't you see where the ages were
[1:45:39] where denominational ages had been
[1:45:41] they've been in a place where where the
[1:45:43] body had been kept in prison in
[1:45:45] denominational ages but this is the hour
[1:45:48] amen when the judge came
[1:45:50] hallelujah when the judge of the earth
[1:45:52] came and he come down in our hour and
[1:45:55] and he
[1:45:55] spoke and he said show me the body let
[1:45:58] us have the body
[1:45:59] show me hallelujah let me see the body
[1:46:02] you don't have a right to hold them
[1:46:03] listen satan does not have a right to
[1:46:05] hold you indefinitely
[1:46:07] amen
[1:46:09] he doesn't have a right to hold you in
[1:46:11] fear to hold you in sickness to hold you
[1:46:13] in sin he has no right to hold you there
[1:46:15] to keep you in prison there's a law
[1:46:17] bigger hallelujah there's a law bigger
[1:46:20] than the law that brought you in there
[1:46:22] there's a law bigger hallelujah there's
[1:46:24] a law bigger than the sin that brought
[1:46:26] you into the prison there's a law that
[1:46:28] says i have a right to be released
[1:46:31] i have a right to stand before the judge
[1:46:33] and let my rights be judged by the lamb
[1:46:35] [Applause]
[1:46:38] amen
[1:46:39] i gotta write
[1:46:40] amen and i got an attorney who will
[1:46:42] write a letter to him and say judge we
[1:46:45] have a man that's been kept up in sin
[1:46:47] it's time that he was released
[1:46:49] [Applause]
[1:46:50] hallelujah
[1:46:52] we have a right to enforce if there's a
[1:46:54] law to enforce this rightful condition
[1:46:56] of restoration he said like if somebody
[1:46:58] stole some property and they're holding
[1:47:00] the property captive you can go take the
[1:47:01] law and go to this person and the law
[1:47:03] enforces this person to restore this
[1:47:05] property back to this natural owner into
[1:47:08] his libel first estate
[1:47:09] and forrester said that we have the
[1:47:11] privilege to enforce upon satan the
[1:47:13] claims that god give us
[1:47:16] hallelujah
[1:47:17] because you're not really doing it for
[1:47:18] yourself you're doing it for the lamb
[1:47:23] quit letting the devil beat you up
[1:47:25] say well we'll give some rights back to
[1:47:26] the devil just to be fair no you're not
[1:47:28] doing it for yourself
[1:47:30] you're here as an agent of the lamb
[1:47:34] hallelujah
[1:47:36] enforce those rights
[1:47:38] and force those claims upon satan say
[1:47:40] give it back and he has to do it he said
[1:47:42] because we can take god's agent the holy
[1:47:44] spirit go right down on our knees and
[1:47:45] say it's thus saith the lord
[1:47:48] hallelujah
[1:47:49] he's got to give it up that's all
[1:47:51] because the holy spirit is there to make
[1:47:53] him do it
[1:47:55] amen
[1:47:57] he said for god has a law
[1:47:59] he said his word is is his law
[1:48:02] god in this word made certain claims to
[1:48:04] the church therefore we have a right to
[1:48:06] force those claims upon satan and say
[1:48:08] give it back and he has to do it we can
[1:48:09] take god's agent holy spirit go right
[1:48:11] down our knees and say it let's say the
[1:48:12] lord he's got to give it up that's all
[1:48:14] because the holy spirit is there to make
[1:48:15] him do it he said the law of the land is
[1:48:17] to enforce it's by the land for the land
[1:48:19] but the law of the spirit of god is to
[1:48:21] force satan to give up that which he is
[1:48:23] unrightfully deceitfully taken from god
[1:48:26] souls of men remember he didn't have a
[1:48:28] right to your children he didn't have a
[1:48:30] right to your body he didn't have a
[1:48:32] right he took it deceitfully listen if

[1:48:53] these things be brought back to me and
[1:48:55] you have a right to call the law this

[1:48:59] claim that the devil places against you
[1:49:03] whatever david the devil stole from you

[1:49:09] brother branham said souls of men he
[1:49:10] took from god souls of women children
[1:49:12] sickness of the body places upon people
[1:49:14] where god made them in his image to be
[1:49:16] like him and the church was given the
[1:49:18] rightful legal rights by the bible to
[1:49:20] take the holy spirit and enforce this
[1:49:21] upon him
[1:49:23] amen
[1:49:24] now we defend all the lamb's rights with
[1:49:26] an open book and our age they could only
[1:49:29] defend
[1:49:30] what the eye could see in that horn of
[1:49:32] that age but today we all the loose ends
[1:49:35] have been tied up

[1:50:30] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:50:32] and glory and blessing do you believe

[1:50:45] throne and unto the lamb forever and
[1:50:47] ever and the four beasts said amen and
[1:50:49] the four and twenty elders fell down and
[1:50:50] worshiped him liveth forever and ever
[1:50:52] brother branham said about that when
[1:50:54] they all began to worship him he said
[1:50:55] john worshipped him so much until he
[1:50:57] said every creature in heaven and the
[1:50:58] earth underneath the earth heard me
[1:51:00] saying he said blessings glory power
[1:51:01] wisdom might be to the lamb he said the
[1:51:04] worship time for the king lamb
[1:51:06] but listen
[1:51:08] what is he becoming now look look what
[1:51:09] the age that we live in we live at the
[1:51:11] end of the end when the lamb is slain he
[1:51:13] walked forward from eternity brother
[1:51:15] brown said out of the father's throne
[1:51:17] he said took his rights he said when he
[1:51:20] took his rights it was a judgment seat
[1:51:23] and he become not a lamb but a lion a
[1:51:24] king

[1:52:03] things to do

[1:52:08] has worked really hard to make it a
[1:52:09] habit for people to stream and not go to

[1:53:05] in one day he's going to make that final
[1:53:06] call we're going to go home
[1:53:09] a final call but i believe in this time

[1:53:46] this is my picket line
[1:53:48] this is where i protest
[1:53:50] to protect the rights of the lamb
[1:53:54] hallelujah
[1:53:56] see he has a right to move in our midst
[1:53:59] he has a right to have the people who
[1:54:01] live clean lives
[1:54:05] he has a right
[1:54:06] to think of it each one of you
[1:54:07] personally in your life is a right to
[1:54:10] you without all those
[1:54:11] things that stand in the way of you
[1:54:13] coming when he calls
[1:54:15] that's right
[1:54:17] yes you have a right to be free but he
[1:54:19] has a right for you to be free
[1:54:22] you have a right
[1:54:24] to be worshipped in spirit and in truth
[1:54:28] you say well how do i enforce that right
[1:54:30] this morning brother ben
[1:54:33] jesus said if any man will come after me
[1:54:36] let him deny
[1:54:38] himself
[1:54:41] take up his cross
[1:54:43] and follow me amen
[1:54:48] would you bow your heads with me
[1:54:51] i thought about the marquee to the
[1:54:53] lafayette
[1:54:54] when he come to frank from france
[1:54:57] he come to fight in the revolutionary
[1:54:58] war
[1:54:59] because he recognized a noble cause
[1:55:02] he laid down the rights of his nobility
[1:55:04] as a frenchman
[1:55:06] and he'd come and was wounded
[1:55:08] in the battle of american revolution
[1:55:11] and fought and eventually become a
[1:55:12] general on his own merit
[1:55:14] they come and laid aside all the rights
[1:55:16] that he had as a young nobleman because
[1:55:18] he believed in a cause
[1:55:21] i wonder today if we could lay down our
[1:55:22] rights you see we don't come to an altar
[1:55:24] to
[1:55:25] to get something we come to give
[1:55:27] something up
[1:55:29] if you completely surrender he's
[1:55:31] promised to fill you
[1:55:33] he's promised to give you but you keep
[1:55:35] standing and say well i got a right to
[1:55:36] have a family i got a right to be
[1:55:38] married i got a right to
[1:55:39] i got a right to
[1:55:40] hunt i got a right to fish i got right

[1:55:48] out at a certain time to watch the nfl
[1:55:50] game but

[1:56:04] to be welcomed
[1:56:06] not just in the church but into your
[1:56:08] home
[1:56:09] into your life
[1:56:11] would you stand for his rights today now

[1:56:13] in your life
[1:56:15] how do you do that well you take up your
[1:56:17] cross
[1:56:19] with a man named simon one day
[1:56:21] he stood on at the crossroads he didn't

[1:56:29] just standing there maybe he was in town
[1:56:30] on some sort of business

[1:56:43] walking up the road
[1:56:45] stumbles
[1:56:48] right in front of him
[1:56:49] he falls
[1:56:52] before time began god knew
[1:56:55] that he would
[1:56:56] he would he would immorphy himself he
[1:56:58] would take on the mask of human frailty
[1:57:03] and god
[1:57:04] said in in that man it wasn't god that
[1:57:06] failed god can't fall
[1:57:08] but as a man he fell the body of christ
[1:57:11] fell
[1:57:13] when it did simon just happened to be
[1:57:15] standing there
[1:57:18] i read this one time and i thought
[1:57:20] god i want to view my ministry like that
[1:57:24] i don't want a great ministry i just
[1:57:26] want to be standing there
[1:57:28] when the body of christ is weak
[1:57:31] when there's a need let me be standing
[1:57:32] there
[1:57:34] you didn't even know what it was for
[1:57:36] but a roman soldier pointed him out of
[1:57:38] the crowd he said you carry his cross
[1:57:41] and he walked over and he picked it up
[1:57:44] see you've been picked out of the crowd
[1:57:46] you were born in a message home maybe go
[1:57:48] to a good church you've been picked out
[1:57:50] of a crowd you've been elected by god
[1:57:52] before the foundation of the world you
[1:57:54] carry his cross this morning
[1:57:57] well the pastor does it someone else
[1:57:58] does it but when the body of christ is
[1:58:00] weak
[1:58:01] when it seems like the enemy comes in
[1:58:03] like a flood and he tries to take away
[1:58:06] our rights
[1:58:08] let me be one who stands like simon said
[1:58:10] i'll carry the cross
[1:58:12] i'll be one who takes my position how do
[1:58:15] you do that by surrendering your rights
[1:58:18] would you raise your hands to him if you

[1:58:47] worshipped
