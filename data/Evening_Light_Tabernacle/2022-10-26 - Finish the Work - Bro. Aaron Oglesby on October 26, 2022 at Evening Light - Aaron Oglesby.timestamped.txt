[26:56] Sarita portion of a testimony that was
[27:00] a man said to me we had prayer for that
[27:02] baby out in Arizona the McGrady baby and
[27:06] send in a report a few days ago
[27:09] that said
[27:11] at the 20-week anatomy scan the doctor
[27:13] saw her baby had a very small cerebellum
[27:16] in the brain and we were referred to a
[27:18] specialist for an ultrasound the scan
[27:20] showed that the cerebellum was small and
[27:22] the ventricles in the brain were dilated
[27:23] which means they were retaining too much
[27:25] fluid and not draining properly we were
[27:28] referred for an MRI and ultimately hey
[27:31] they recommended a C-section at 38 weeks
[27:34] because the baby's head was measuring so
[27:36] large due to the dilated ventricles so
[27:39] today Josiah is 13 days old and he's
[27:41] finally stable enough to have an MRI
[27:43] after the procedure the doctor came to
[27:46] go over the results and she said the MRI
[27:48] showed his brain looks normal the
[27:50] ventricles cerebellum and medulla all
[27:52] look normal we're so thankful God has
[27:54] worked a miracle on Josiah's brain
[27:57] amen they want us to continue to pray
[27:59] for that situation certainly have a
[28:01] number of needs there with the family

[41:19] hands of Our Lord
[41:20] Jesus Christ amen let's go to him in
[41:23] prayer
[41:25] Heavenly Father Lord truly you are
[41:28] faithful Lord and you are wonderful you
[41:30] have never failed us and we know you
[41:32] never will Lord and we're looking unto
[41:34] you tonight to come and speak father
[41:36] Lord we're asking Lord that you would
[41:38] come and speak to your children Lord we
[41:40] do not take this responsibility lightly
[41:42] but we understand Lord that there's
[41:44] nothing I could say or do that would
[41:46] Lord free these people or or deliver
[41:49] these people Lord but that's a work you
[41:51] have done father and we're looking more
[41:53] that you would come and anoint your word
[41:54] that you would speak father Lord It's
[41:57] the anointing that would break every
[41:58] chain tonight Lord we're just asking
[42:00] father that Lord as we look unto you now
[42:02] you'll take control of the vessel Lord
[42:05] you see
[42:06] my nervousness Lord and just the things
[42:08] that I've told with today Lord in the
[42:10] word and I'm just asking that you'll
[42:12] help it Lord to be delivered the way you
[42:14] gave it father Lord we look to you now
[42:16] we just ask that you'll take control of
[42:17] this service in Jesus name we pray amen
[42:21] and amen
[42:22] amen if you have your Bibles we'll be
[42:24] turning over to Second Kings the 25th
[42:26] chapter
[42:28] the ninth verse we'll read verse 9 and
[42:31] 10 and then we're going to look to
[42:33] Nehemiah the second chapter
[42:35] you know as we prepare to to look into
[42:38] this
[42:39] you know as I was thinking on these
[42:41] things and and the revelation of Truth
[42:43] in this day and
[42:45] you know it seems like there's a lot of
[42:47] people who can recognize issues that
[42:50] need fixing
[42:51] it seems like there's a lot of people
[42:53] that can even see truths and and maybe
[42:55] have some Revelations but of those
[42:58] people
[42:59] there's too many of them that only
[43:02] recognize and never allow that
[43:05] recognition to put them into action
[43:08] hearers must become doers
[43:11] hearers of the word must become doers
[43:14] and we must allow the Revelation that we
[43:16] have of Who We Are
[43:18] to actually lead us into what we are to
[43:21] do
[43:22] it's not enough just to recognize who we
[43:25] are so
[43:26] so as we look here in Second Kings 25
[43:28] and 9 this is the account of the
[43:30] destruction of the walls of Jerusalem
[43:33] that took place as Israel is being taken
[43:36] captive and exiled into Babylon
[43:39] and I want you to follow me tonight as
[43:41] we as we make some parallels between
[43:43] this wall and the wall of the of
[43:45] protection that we have in the word and
[43:48] the restoration of this wall and the
[43:50] restoration of the word that we've had
[43:52] in this day
[43:54] and it says here and he burnt the house
[43:56] of the Lord and the King's house and all
[43:59] the houses of Jerusalem and every great
[44:02] man's house burnt he with fire and all
[44:05] the army of the chaldees that were with
[44:08] the captain of the Guard Break Down The
[44:10] Walls of Jerusalem round about
[44:14] and then we're going to look in Nehemiah
[44:16] 2.
[44:18] in the first verse
[44:22] it says and it came to pass in the month
[44:24] Nissan in the in the 20th year of Arctic
[44:27] Xerxes the king that wine was before him
[44:30] and I took up the wine and gave it unto
[44:32] him now had not been Before Time sad in
[44:36] his presence wherefore the king said
[44:38] unto me why is that countenance sad
[44:40] seeing Thou Art not sick this is nothing
[44:44] else but sorrow of heart then I was very
[44:47] sore afraid and said unto the king let
[44:49] the King live forever
[44:51] why should not my countenance be sad
[44:54] when the city the place of my father's
[44:56] sepulchers lieth waste and the gates
[44:59] thereof are consumed with fire then the
[45:01] king said unto me for what Dost thou
[45:03] make request so I prayed to the god of
[45:06] heaven and I said unto the king if it
[45:09] pleased the king and If thy servant hath
[45:11] found favor in thy sight that thou would
[45:13] Ascend me unto Judah unto the city of my
[45:16] father's sepulchers that I may build it
[45:19] and the King said unto me the queen also
[45:21] sitting by him for how long shall thy
[45:24] journey be and when will thou return so
[45:27] it pleased the king to send me and I set
[45:30] him a time moreover I said unto the king
[45:33] if it pleased the king let letters be
[45:35] given me to the governors beyond the
[45:36] river that they may convey me over till
[45:39] I come into Judah in a letter unto asaph
[45:41] The Keeper of the king's Forest that he
[45:43] may give me Timber to make beans for the
[45:46] gates of the palace which I pertain to
[45:48] the house and for the wall of the city
[45:50] and for the house that I shall enter
[45:52] into and the King granted me according
[45:55] to the good hand of my God upon me amen
[45:59] you may have your seats tonight as we
[46:01] ask the Lord to add his Blessing now to
[46:03] the reading of the word
[46:10] notice there in in Nehemiah 2 and 6
[46:13] notice how concerned the king is about
[46:17] the details he doesn't just say sure
[46:20] sure go ahead go Build That Wall and and
[46:22] best of luck to you good luck in your
[46:25] endeavors he says for how long shall thy
[46:27] journey be and when wilt thou return
[46:31] see he's interested in the details of
[46:34] our life he's interested in the details
[46:37] of the things that that he is putting in
[46:39] motion he doesn't just send you out
[46:40] there upon your own he says how long and
[46:43] and when will you return and the reason
[46:45] for these questions is is because he's
[46:48] wanting to provide every single step of
[46:51] the way he's wanting to make sure that
[46:53] Nehemiah has everything that he's going
[46:55] to need for the entirety of the journey
[46:57] and not only that but the king then puts
[47:00] it in writing so that Nehemiah goes on
[47:02] this journey with the authority of the
[47:05] king he goes on this journey with the
[47:08] official seal of the king listen he
[47:10] didn't just send us down here in
[47:12] laodicea and say good luck to you but he
[47:14] left you with everything you would have
[47:16] need of every provision you would have
[47:19] need of and then he gave you the king
[47:21] seal so you would have the authority of
[47:24] the king while you were here on this
[47:26] journey
[47:27] Nehemiah 2 and 9 it says then I came to
[47:30] the governors beyond the river and gave
[47:33] them the king's letters now the king had
[47:36] sent captains of the army and Horsemen
[47:39] with me Church you're not alone tonight
[47:41] he did not only supply for your needs
[47:43] and give you a seal but the angels of
[47:45] God are around us tonight they are
[47:47] encamped about us They are going before
[47:49] us he said I'm going to send you but I'm
[47:52] not sending you alone I'm sending you
[47:54] look with the Army and with the horsemen
[47:56] of the army we are surrounded and well
[47:59] taken care of tonight
[48:02] verse 10 when sand ballot the horror
[48:06] night and tobiah the servant the
[48:08] ammonite heard of it it grieved them
[48:10] exceedingly that there was come a man to
[48:13] seek the welfare of the children of
[48:16] Israel listen the devil don't like it
[48:19] when the Lord comes to take care of you
[48:21] the wolf don't like it when the
[48:23] shepherd's around the wolf don't like it
[48:25] when the shepherd's taking care of his
[48:27] sheep because he knows then you are
[48:29] protected he knows he can't rob you
[48:31] anymore he knows he can't attack you
[48:34] anymore he knows he can't bring false
[48:36] claims against you anymore it Grieves
[48:39] them that one had come to check on the
[48:42] welfare of Israel and in this day Church
[48:45] the mighty angel came down to check on
[48:48] the welfare of his people in this day to
[48:51] see the condition of the walls the
[48:53] mighty angel came down to see what was
[48:55] being done to protect his people from
[48:58] the enemy to make sure that the word
[49:00] that is to be our protection was being
[49:02] put it in the right place that the wall
[49:04] was being strengthened exactly how we
[49:07] needed it in this day that word was to
[49:09] be our protection he wanted to make sure
[49:12] that it was coming that the word was in
[49:14] its proper place so that it could defeat
[49:16] the enemy any place anywhere anytime and
[49:20] so the mighty angel came down to see
[49:22] about our welfare in this day and I can
[49:24] tell you just like here the enemy didn't
[49:26] like it one bit he railed against it he
[49:29] hated it because there was a message of
[49:31] restoration that came to restore the
[49:33] walls a message that came to check on
[49:36] your welfare to check on your well-being
[49:38] to make sure you were being taken care
[49:40] of the way you were supposed to be
[49:44] come on
[49:45] the enemy didn't like a message coming
[49:48] to restore what the enemy had destroyed
[49:52] Nehemiah finds that there is great work
[49:54] to be done
[49:56] the enemy has completely destroyed the
[49:58] walls and now those that have returned
[50:00] and are are trying to make a home in
[50:02] their Homeland are living in in
[50:05] Jerusalem at the mercy of those that are
[50:08] all around them
[50:11] they try to raise a crop but it's stolen
[50:15] they try to be fruitful but their fields
[50:17] are trampled upon
[50:19] they don't have the protection that
[50:21] they're supposed to have that the church
[50:23] would try to accept truth and begin to
[50:25] rise up but they would be struck back
[50:27] down Time and Time and Time Again by
[50:29] false doctrines by the power of
[50:31] denominations brother Branham would even
[50:34] see it in a dream there as a Triune club
[50:36] that it would strike the people with and
[50:39] he says every time she started to rise
[50:41] up meaning the congregation would begin
[50:43] to accept truth he would drive her right
[50:46] back down again with that false Doctrine
[50:48] he would come and down Through the Ages
[50:51] that the church that little True Vine
[50:53] would try to raise up and it would be
[50:55] struck down again struck down again
[50:57] because the walls had been torn down
[50:59] there was no protection there like it
[51:01] was supposed to be
[51:03] Nehemiah finds that that there are still
[51:05] Stones there
[51:07] but they've been jumbled up
[51:09] they've been burned over they've been
[51:11] torn down there's pieces of wall
[51:13] everywhere there's pieces of truth but
[51:17] with so many gaps there in the wall the
[51:19] enemy could come and go as it pleased
[51:21] the devil could come in whenever it
[51:23] wanted come in and Rob you of your joy
[51:25] rob you of your peace bring false truths
[51:27] in because the wall had gaps everywhere
[51:30] in it
[51:31] had the people living below their
[51:33] privileges
[51:34] the bride tree completely stripped down
[51:36] by the canker worm and the Palmer worm
[51:38] and the Locust and the caterpillar there
[51:40] was hardly anything left
[51:42] the walls had been demolished and the
[51:44] stones heaped up and burned to make sure
[51:47] that it would be very difficult for it
[51:50] to ever be rebuilt again
[51:53] he wanted to make sure that it would be
[51:55] almost impossible to ever be rebuilt
[51:57] again and you look around at our at our
[52:00] lives at the people that the enemy comes
[52:02] against and that's exactly how the enemy
[52:04] does he doesn't just want to see you
[52:06] fall he doesn't just want to see you
[52:08] fail but he wants to so ruin your life
[52:10] to where it looks like it could never be
[52:12] rebuilt again he wants to get into a
[52:15] condition where it looks like it can
[52:16] never be made whole to where people just
[52:19] give up on you to where people don't
[52:20] even know where to start but tonight I
[52:23] want to tell you that our God is in the
[52:25] restoration business it doesn't matter
[52:27] what the situation looks like it don't
[52:29] matter how far down he's taking you it
[52:31] don't matter if I gave up on you Mama
[52:33] gave up on your daddy gave up on you
[52:35] he's in the restoration business tonight
[52:37] he can turn your life around in One
[52:40] Moment In One blink of an eye it doesn't
[52:43] matter how scarred up you are one
[52:45] encounter with almighty God can change
[52:48] all that
[52:49] oh the devil would put years and years
[52:51] and years and years into the life of the
[52:53] woman at the well but One Moment In His
[52:56] presence One Moment In His presence and
[52:59] it changed all that it made her into a
[53:01] daughter of the Living God
[53:03] he can put years into your life but one
[53:06] moment in the presence of God can turn
[53:08] all of that around mere moments
[53:12] What a Mighty God that what the devil
[53:15] takes decades and decades and years and
[53:17] years to do God can undo in One Moment
[53:19] In His presence just one moment I say
[53:22] have a moment tonight if you need God
[53:24] just have a moment tonight just step
[53:26] into his present for what it is you have
[53:28] need of and have your moment tonight
[53:30] [Applause]
[53:35] Nehemiah looks over the place where the
[53:38] mighty wall once stood
[53:40] he looks
[53:42] at how it's been left in Ruins and knows
[53:44] it must be rebuilt
[53:46] a city with Broken Walls reveals the
[53:48] defeated people
[53:50] sitting with Broken Walls
[53:52] shows that people who are vulnerable
[53:55] a church with partial word and partial
[53:58] truth cannot withstand the enemy
[54:01] the first age had left its first love
[54:03] then it began to decline and it soon
[54:06] found itself in Exile just as Israel had
[54:09] him
[54:11] but that didn't satisfy the enemy
[54:14] he wanted to make the gospel walls so
[54:16] unrecognizable
[54:18] to where it could never be rebuilt
[54:21] he wanted to make it impossible to be
[54:23] rebuilt to the way that they'd had it
[54:24] there in the book of Acts the way it had
[54:27] the way it had been there in the in the
[54:28] upper room in the first age so so he
[54:30] goes to work dismantling the word Peace
[54:33] by peace
[54:35] and once that false Vine was in control
[54:37] it began to crush the life out of the
[54:39] church
[54:40] it hated how the True Vine would try to
[54:42] rise up time after time try to rise up
[54:45] and fight back and stand for truth and
[54:48] Time After Time the false Vine would
[54:49] beat the True Vine down again and again
[54:52] with false doctrines
[54:53] and so just how just as Nebuchadnezzar
[54:56] had gotten so tired of Jerusalem
[54:59] rebelling and Israel rebelling that he
[55:01] finally came in and just burnt the whole
[55:03] city down
[55:04] the false Vine gets tired of the True
[55:07] Vine trying to rise up
[55:09] and the false Vine begins to just
[55:11] squeeze the very life out of it and to
[55:13] tear it down and he does the same thing
[55:15] with the word that Nebuchadnezzar had
[55:16] done with the walls so the word is
[55:18] stripped down and torn down and mangled
[55:20] and heaped up true baptism is done away
[55:23] with the truth of the godhead has done
[55:25] away with intercession of saints and
[55:28] praying to the dead becomes the normal
[55:30] in the church Purgatory is taught
[55:32] worship is formalized the supernatural
[55:35] becomes buried underneath the ideas of
[55:37] man and Creeds and dogmas and then an
[55:40] ungodly priesthood is set up and the
[55:42] word isn't even allowed to be put in the
[55:44] hands of the Common Man anymore
[55:46] for the common man doesn't even know
[55:48] what the word of God is they might can
[55:51] look and see a piece of Truth they might
[55:53] can look and see a pile of rubble and
[55:55] try to get through and and all the
[55:57] dogmas and the Latin and the things they
[55:59] didn't even speak but it wasn't a wall
[56:00] of protection anymore it was just rubble
[56:03] and gaps and holes and the enemy could
[56:05] come and go as it pleased
[56:09] to the believer had no protection at all
[56:11] only misplaced stones in rubble
[56:15] crumbs have truths pieces
[56:19] just like the walls of Jerusalem
[56:22] but a king had commissioned Nehemiah to
[56:25] rebuild it
[56:26] he said rebuild the wall and I'll give
[56:28] you whatever it takes I'll Supply every
[56:31] need you just make sure the wall is
[56:33] built back up to where the people have
[56:34] the proper protection that's where they
[56:36] have a proper place to stand behind he
[56:39] was commissioned to bring Jerusalem back
[56:41] to the city that she once was he's
[56:44] commissioned and there was a word from a
[56:46] king that said I will restore saith the
[56:50] Lord I'll pour my spirit out upon All
[56:52] Flesh just like I did that day at
[56:54] Pentecost the word is going to be put
[56:57] back into its proper place once again it
[56:59] will be a full armor as it was there in
[57:02] Ephesians once again it's going to be
[57:04] Vindicated in power like it was at the
[57:06] gate called beautiful I'm going to
[57:08] restore it to its former glory the wall
[57:11] will be built back up
[57:13] [Applause]
[57:16] and not to Discount the other Mighty
[57:18] moves of God
[57:20] like Luther Wesley and Azusa those were
[57:23] great moves Mighty moves of God but they
[57:26] in no way restored the wall
[57:29] they in no way built the wall back to
[57:31] what it had been there in the first age
[57:34] they in no way were the book of Acts
[57:36] Church restored
[57:37] that's not what those moves were but
[57:40] they did uncover
[57:42] some very important stones that needed
[57:44] to go back in the wall
[57:46] they dug out that stone of justification
[57:49] that needed to be put back
[57:51] the just shall live by faith
[57:53] they dug out that stone there of
[57:55] sanctification that needed to be put
[57:57] back in the wall
[57:58] they dug out some very important truths
[58:00] but the church was still Bound by false
[58:03] doctrines
[58:04] the church was still Bound by false
[58:06] baptisms
[58:08] false ideas Creeds of man dogmas of man
[58:12] but there was a foundation there
[58:15] there was still a foundation there you
[58:17] could tell where things had once been
[58:20] but you needed someone with a commission
[58:22] from the King
[58:24] oh come on somebody you needed somebody
[58:26] that had been visited by an Angel you
[58:28] need somebody that was sent to restore
[58:30] you needed somebody that was sent to
[58:32] turn your heart back to the faith of the
[58:34] fathers to build it up how it had once
[58:37] been you needed someone with the king's
[58:39] Commission someone not afraid of the
[58:42] corrupt systems not afraid to stand and
[58:44] call out the religious leaders not
[58:46] afraid to call out the corruption and
[58:48] those that would corrupt others oh come
[58:50] on this is our Prophet we're talking
[58:52] about now somebody who stood in the face
[58:54] of criticism with thus saith the Lord
[58:57] nobody else had thus saith the Lord this
[59:00] was the one commissioned to rebuild the
[59:02] wall this was the one commissioned to
[59:03] put it all back in this place
[59:06] he stood in the face of criticism
[59:08] he faced Goliath he stood when his
[59:11] friends turned against him
[59:13] he stood to rebuild the wall
[59:17] he says in the church age book though he
[59:20] will not be popular
[59:21] he will be Vindicated by God
[59:24] as Jesus authenticated John and the Holy
[59:27] Ghost authenticated Jesus we can well
[59:29] expect this man will be first of all
[59:31] authenticated by the spirit working in
[59:34] his life in Acts of power that are
[59:37] indisputable and found nowhere else I
[59:39] say Amen
[59:41] that's exactly what happened in this day
[59:44] he says who then will have the power of
[59:46] infallibility which is to be restored in
[59:48] the last age
[59:49] for this last age is going to go back to
[59:52] manifesting the pure word bride that
[59:56] means we will have to have the word once
[59:57] again as it was perfectly given and
[1:00:00] perfectly understood in the days of Paul
[1:00:03] I will tell you who will have it it will
[1:00:05] be a prophet as thoroughly Vindicated or
[1:00:08] even more Vindicated than with any
[1:00:10] prophet in all the ages from Enoch to
[1:00:12] this day because this man will of
[1:00:14] necessity have the Capstone prophetic
[1:00:17] Ministry and God will show him forth he
[1:00:20] won't need to speak for himself God will
[1:00:22] speak for him by the voice of the sign
[1:00:24] amen
[1:00:27] and that's exactly what happened in this
[1:00:29] day through the ministry of William
[1:00:30] Branham fulfilling Malachi 4.
[1:00:33] God came to see about the welfare of his
[1:00:35] people
[1:00:36] God came down to check and see how
[1:00:39] things were on the wall he sent one to
[1:00:41] bring a message a breast or weight
[1:00:43] Russian to fill in the gaps to take away
[1:00:46] the breach as it were to close up the
[1:00:49] gaps to put the stones back in place and
[1:00:51] the enemy hated it
[1:00:53] the enemy hated it it railed against it
[1:00:55] and they continued to this day to attack
[1:00:57] the messenger they continue to attack
[1:01:00] him because he dared to seek the welfare
[1:01:02] of God's people instead of the
[1:01:04] established religious religious
[1:01:05] organizations of the day he dared not
[1:01:08] bow down to the nominations but he stood
[1:01:10] and he said we're going to build the
[1:01:12] wall we're going to fill in the gaps
[1:01:14] we're going to preach truth if it costs
[1:01:16] me my friends we're going to preach
[1:01:17] truth if I don't have a Pulpit to go to
[1:01:19] and the wall began to come back up once
[1:01:21] again
[1:01:23] Nehemiah 2 and 10.
[1:01:26] when sen ballot the horror night and
[1:01:28] tobiah the servant heard of it it
[1:01:30] grieved them exceedingly that there was
[1:01:33] come a man to seek the welfare of the
[1:01:35] children of Israel
[1:01:37] but see the very same message that
[1:01:39] grieved others it came to bring me
[1:01:41] liberty the very message that Grieves
[1:01:43] other brings joy into my heart it brings
[1:01:46] Liberty in my soul except this captive
[1:01:48] free I'm so glad that one came to see
[1:01:51] about my well-being they came to bring
[1:01:53] me Freedom he came to bring me
[1:01:55] Deliverance that came to bring me
[1:01:56] healing
[1:01:57] I'm so glad one came to check on our
[1:02:00] welfare it came to call us to be his
[1:02:03] broad
[1:02:03] [Applause]
[1:02:06] oh it greed sand ballad and sabaya but
[1:02:10] what did it do
[1:02:11] for the people
[1:02:13] it grieved God's enemies
[1:02:16] it grieved those that had
[1:02:19] their meal ticket punched by the
[1:02:20] religious organizations
[1:02:22] oh it grieve those but what did it do
[1:02:25] for the people if we look in 2 and 18.
[1:02:27] then I told them of the hand of my God
[1:02:30] which was good upon me as also the
[1:02:34] king's words
[1:02:35] come on Church we've heard the king's
[1:02:37] words in this day that he had spoken
[1:02:39] unto me and they said let us rise up and
[1:02:43] build so they strengthen their hands for
[1:02:46] this good work
[1:02:47] listen it wasn't just recognizing that
[1:02:50] this man had come from the King he
[1:02:52] wasn't just recognizing that he had been
[1:02:54] given a commission what they did is they
[1:02:56] took the message and they allowed it to
[1:02:57] strengthen their hands and they said let
[1:02:59] us rise up let us get on the wall let us
[1:03:02] do the work let us rebuild let us get
[1:03:05] underneath this same anointing
[1:03:06] underneath the commission of the king
[1:03:08] let us tear down the way to me let us
[1:03:11] attack let us stand let's stand with our
[1:03:14] Messenger stand with the one Vindicated
[1:03:16] stand on the wall tonight they said let
[1:03:19] us rise and the message strengthen their
[1:03:23] hands
[1:03:24] not just recognizing yes you're right
[1:03:27] the wall needs to be rebuilt
[1:03:29] yes you're right something needs to be
[1:03:31] done
[1:03:32] it's more than just a recognition
[1:03:36] or even a revelation that it's the truth
[1:03:39] it's more than that
[1:03:43] but the message from the King
[1:03:44] strengthened their hands
[1:03:47] strengthen their hands to do the work
[1:03:49] let us defeat the enemy let us cast
[1:03:53] Satan down let us come out from
[1:03:55] underneath oppression after all it's us
[1:03:58] who's being robbed it's us who's being
[1:04:00] attacked it's us who's being Afflicted
[1:04:03] let us do something about it let us take
[1:04:06] the commission of the king and do
[1:04:07] something tonight
[1:04:08] let us do our part
[1:04:12] maybe to others it was silly
[1:04:15] maybe to others their religion they had
[1:04:16] was just fine
[1:04:18] maybe to others it was too far gone
[1:04:20] maybe to others these things are just
[1:04:21] for AIDS gone by but to an elect people
[1:04:24] to a people called to be part of the
[1:04:27] Restoration in this day to a people
[1:04:29] called for the restoration and not just
[1:04:31] a restoration you're not just doing the
[1:04:33] restoration work you are the restoration
[1:04:36] work you are a stone oh that see gene on

[1:05:07] part of the restored Jerusalem
[1:05:13] the message called the people
[1:05:16] to finish the work
[1:05:18] that's what we're speaking about tonight
[1:05:21] finish the work
[1:05:23] finish the work
[1:05:25] this isn't to indicate that William
[1:05:27] Branham didn't finish his work
[1:05:29] we're not looking for another messenger
[1:05:31] or another man to come and finish
[1:05:33] something that he didn't he finished
[1:05:36] he finished strong he ran well
[1:05:39] he played his part
[1:05:41] there's no doubt about that
[1:05:42] but the work isn't the work isn't
[1:05:45] finished or we wouldn't still be here
[1:05:49] the work isn't finished or we wouldn't
[1:05:51] still be here
[1:05:52] because there is a broad body
[1:05:55] that is to have a Ministry
[1:05:57] there is a broad body that has a work
[1:05:59] that she must do a work that she must
[1:06:02] fulfill
[1:06:04] the message
[1:06:06] came not just to show you that
[1:06:08] but it came to strengthen your hands for
[1:06:11] the work that you must do
[1:06:13] it came to strengthen you
[1:06:15] it showed us who we are and now we have
[1:06:18] to get to work
[1:06:19] it showed us who we are it wasn't just
[1:06:22] the restoration of the word in this day
[1:06:24] but there's something that though that
[1:06:26] was supposed to be done with that word
[1:06:29] not just a restoration of the word for
[1:06:31] the sake of restoring the word but what
[1:06:33] are you going to do with it
[1:06:35] what are you gonna do with that word
[1:06:37] because there's a work that's to be done
[1:06:39] with that word there's a work that's to
[1:06:42] be done for all to be family you say
[1:06:43] well Jesus finished everything and he
[1:06:45] cried out on the cross it is finished
[1:06:47] yes judgment was paid for
[1:06:50] absolutely healing was bought salvation
[1:06:52] was bought he finished his job the Plan
[1:06:55] of Redemption was finished that's all
[1:06:57] true but there still has to be an
[1:06:59] application of that finished work
[1:07:02] brother Branham would say but now you
[1:07:04] have to take what he did and defeat the
[1:07:06] Devil personally
[1:07:08] he says the work was finished at Calvary
[1:07:10] and we only looked to that place and by
[1:07:12] faith we draw dividends off of our
[1:07:15] Eternal salvation
[1:07:18] and what we know is is that Jesus was
[1:07:20] the complete finishing up or fulfillment
[1:07:24] of the Old Testament
[1:07:26] man they that's right
[1:07:29] he fulfilled all the Old Testament but
[1:07:31] not the new
[1:07:34] listen to The Prophet here he said the
[1:07:36] word is in his bride
[1:07:38] the bride has the mind of Christ for she
[1:07:40] knows what he wants done with the word
[1:07:43] she performs the command of the word in
[1:07:45] his name for she has thus saith the Lord
[1:07:48] well no brother Branham had this note
[1:07:50] she has
[1:07:52] thus saith the Lord
[1:07:56] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:07:58] and it comes to pass like a seed that is
[1:08:01] planted and watered it comes to full
[1:08:03] Harvest serving its purpose those in the
[1:08:07] bride do only his will no one can make
[1:08:09] them do otherwise they have thus saith
[1:08:12] the Lord or they keep still now listen
[1:08:14] they know that it has to be God in them
[1:08:17] doing the works fulfilling his own word
[1:08:20] he did not complete all his work while
[1:08:24] his Earthly Ministry
[1:08:26] so now he works in and through the bride
[1:08:30] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:08:33] for him to do certain things that he
[1:08:36] must now do
[1:08:38] but he will now fulfill through the
[1:08:41] bride that work which he left for this
[1:08:45] specific time
[1:08:48] what a responsibility
[1:08:51] as a major response we can't just be on
[1:08:54] cruise control we can't just be well I
[1:08:56] see the message yet the words restored
[1:08:59] what are you doing with it
[1:09:01] there are works for you to do there are
[1:09:03] things that you are supposed to fulfill
[1:09:05] there are things that must be finished
[1:09:08] and guess who is supposed to do it
[1:09:11] you
[1:09:13] no brother Aaron I just accepted this
[1:09:15] message and I'm going to sit on a Pew
[1:09:16] I'm gonna catch a couple tapes a week
[1:09:17] and yeah that does it
[1:09:21] for what
[1:09:23] what are you doing with it
[1:09:25] why are you listening
[1:09:28] why are you feeding on well to gang
[1:09:30] strength strength for what to go to work
[1:09:32] tomorrow
[1:09:33] this isn't natural strength
[1:09:36] what is this word restored for there are
[1:09:39] things that you are supposed to do with
[1:09:41] it you were supposed to continue the
[1:09:43] ministry of Jesus Christ on the earth in
[1:09:46] the last day not in one flesh of the
[1:09:49] body called Jesus but in a many membered
[1:09:52] body here upon the Earth walking like
[1:09:54] Jesus talking like Jesus defeating the
[1:09:56] devil like Jesus you are to fulfill
[1:09:58] those Works in this day
[1:10:03] it's more than seeing that the wall
[1:10:05] needed to be fixed
[1:10:08] it was more than seeing that the message
[1:10:10] is truth it's putting your hands to the
[1:10:13] work
[1:10:14] putting your hands to the work so that
[1:10:16] all things can be fulfilled
[1:10:18] you know we often preach about we've
[1:10:20] heard it for years that it's important
[1:10:21] to recognize Who You Are
[1:10:24] amen it is
[1:10:25] it's very important not to place
[1:10:27] yourself in the wrong place
[1:10:29] you know if you claim to be something
[1:10:30] you're not and you place yourself in the
[1:10:31] wrong place in the scripture that can be
[1:10:33] a bad thing
[1:10:34] very bad it's important to recognize who
[1:10:37] you are why well sure it shows you what
[1:10:39] your Authority is
[1:10:41] it shows you your Authority it allows
[1:10:43] you to cast down the lives of the Enemy
[1:10:45] No that's not who I am the word says I'm
[1:10:47] this and those things are all true and
[1:10:48] things that we need
[1:10:50] but knowing who you are in this
[1:10:52] scripture is important because it shows
[1:10:54] you what you're supposed to fulfill
[1:10:58] knowing who you are is important because
[1:11:00] it tells you what work you're supposed
[1:11:02] to do
[1:11:03] where you're supposed to apply the word
[1:11:06] that has been given to you Nehemiah
[1:11:08] wasn't going to build the wall by
[1:11:10] himself
[1:11:11] he didn't bring a message to the people
[1:11:13] so he can say now y'all sit back this is
[1:11:15] true the wall needs to be restored it's
[1:11:16] going to be built watch this
[1:11:19] no but his message called a people
[1:11:21] his message reached out to a people who
[1:11:23] were supposed to be a part of the
[1:11:25] restoration
[1:11:26] his message called for people and it
[1:11:28] strengthened people to do the work look
[1:11:31] Jesus knew who he was and so he knew
[1:11:34] exactly what it was he was going to
[1:11:36] fulfill that's how he could find himself
[1:11:38] in the scripture listen to this when
[1:11:40] brother Brown describes him coming to
[1:11:42] John he said suffer this to be so John
[1:11:44] that is right in other words John you're
[1:11:47] a mighty man you're a great Mighty
[1:11:50] prophet and your revelation of me is
[1:11:52] exactly the truth John had Revelation
[1:11:54] that's good enough
[1:11:55] he knew this was the Messiah that's good
[1:11:57] absolutely not
[1:11:58] he said your Revelation is exactly the
[1:12:01] truth and if we are the lights of this
[1:12:03] day we must fulfill all righteousness
[1:12:07] all God's word must be fulfilled by us
[1:12:10] for this day for it's becoming to us
[1:12:13] behooving becoming it's like us for if
[1:12:16] we are the true Witnesses of God today
[1:12:18] John we are the lights of this age and
[1:12:21] if we are the lights of this age there's
[1:12:23] so much scripture that's got to be
[1:12:25] fulfilled during this age and it's up to
[1:12:28] us hallelujah he says it's up to us to
[1:12:31] see that all God's righteousness is
[1:12:33] fulfilled and what is his righteousness
[1:12:36] his word
[1:12:37] brother Brown said it's up to us
[1:12:40] to fulfill all of God's word
[1:12:43] in other words John you know who I am
[1:12:46] I'm the high priest that's true John and
[1:12:49] I have need to be baptized of thee but
[1:12:51] we've got to fulfill all righteousness
[1:12:53] and I have need to be baptized of thee
[1:12:56] now to fulfill the word of God because
[1:12:58] all the words got to be fulfilled and we
[1:13:01] are the lights of the day and it's up to
[1:13:04] us to fulfill all this and I know that
[1:13:06] your your desire is to fulfill the word
[1:13:08] it's becoming to us we are the lights
[1:13:11] the light of every age to do the same
[1:13:14] thing we know what's to be fulfilled he
[1:13:18] says you who are spiritual and know the
[1:13:20] word of God you see what God has
[1:13:21] promised now the word will not come just
[1:13:24] easy or by observation you've got to
[1:13:27] press your way in to do it but yet it
[1:13:30] behooveth us it's becoming to us to
[1:13:33] fulfill all God's righteousness we must
[1:13:38] do it
[1:13:40] we must do it we must continue the
[1:13:43] ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:13:44] we must walk how Jesus walked it's
[1:13:48] restoring a church back to where it's
[1:13:50] not just one but it's many walking and
[1:13:52] laying their hands on the sick walking
[1:13:54] and tearing Satan's kingdom down walking
[1:13:56] and seeing the enemy cast out walking
[1:13:58] and seeing his brother strengthen it's
[1:14:01] our ministry we must see all the
[1:14:04] righteousness of God fulfilled
[1:14:10] Satan sees it happening
[1:14:16] he sees the people beginning to walk and
[1:14:19] talk and operate like they did there in
[1:14:21] the book of Acts and I can tell you he
[1:14:22] hates it he hates it because it's not
[1:14:25] just one person called Jesus doing it
[1:14:26] now it's not just 120 walking around
[1:14:29] doing it now but it's a worldwide body
[1:14:32] who's recognizing who she is and by
[1:14:34] seeing who she is she's allowing that to
[1:14:36] push her into action for what she's
[1:14:38] supposed to do and what she's supposed
[1:14:40] to do is tear Satan's kingdom down the
[1:14:43] word will tear Satan's kingdom out in
[1:14:45] your life in your life in your life in
[1:14:46] each one of our Lives if we allow it to
[1:14:48] work as the ministry of Christ repeated
[1:14:51] tearing down the enemy's strongholds
[1:14:59] it's no longer just a body called Jesus
[1:15:02] but redeemed flesh redeemed Sons
[1:15:05] redeemed daughters that he can overcome
[1:15:07] in
[1:15:08] that he can cast Satan down in
[1:15:14] who brother Aaron you
[1:15:17] your flesh
[1:15:18] your body
[1:15:20] it's you that's got to take this
[1:15:21] responsibility
[1:15:23] he sees people conducting themselves
[1:15:25] again like they did in the first age he
[1:15:27] sees people conducting themselves again
[1:15:29] like they did there in the book of Acts
[1:15:31] and he begins to throw everything he can
[1:15:33] at you to keep you from fulfilling what
[1:15:36] this message called you to do he throws
[1:15:38] everything he can at you to get you to
[1:15:40] sit back and relax and say I'm okay I'm
[1:15:42] fine I'm just in the message that's not
[1:15:44] what we came to this message for that's
[1:15:46] not what it called us for it called us
[1:15:48] the Rapture he told us to overcome he
[1:15:51] called us to feed every enemy to defeat
[1:15:53] hell it called us to do something and
[1:15:56] called us to be victorious
[1:15:58] you've got a work to do
[1:16:05] nehemiah's very arrival on the scene
[1:16:08] awaken that sleeping enmity
[1:16:12] that the enemies had for the Jewish
[1:16:13] people
[1:16:15] it awakened that they had not been
[1:16:17] worried about the Jews for years because
[1:16:19] they could come and go as they pleased
[1:16:21] they could take what they wanted from
[1:16:22] them they could Rob from them they could
[1:16:24] steal from they wasn't worried about
[1:16:25] them
[1:16:27] you let a church sit there cold
[1:16:29] formal and backslid
[1:16:32] stagnant and beat down and the devil sit
[1:16:35] back just as happy as he can be robbing
[1:16:37] them at every turn
[1:16:39] everybody
[1:16:41] the wall ain't built back up he comes
[1:16:43] and goes as he pleases
[1:16:45] but you let just once that church start
[1:16:47] to waken up a little bit
[1:16:49] you let that people begin to move a
[1:16:51] little bit once there was no Victory no
[1:16:54] overcoming no rejoicing enemy coming in
[1:16:56] through every Gap but you let those
[1:16:57] people begin to rise up and the message
[1:16:59] began to become a reality to those
[1:17:01] people you let them once stop being just
[1:17:03] hearers and start being doers let them
[1:17:06] one time begin to put the word in action
[1:17:08] in the works of Christ begin to act out
[1:17:10] through that congregation and you find
[1:17:12] them start to put those Dynamics where
[1:17:14] it's supposed to go in there with with
[1:17:16] the mechanics and they began to piece it
[1:17:18] all together one time let that start to
[1:17:20] happen and watch the enemy all of a
[1:17:21] sudden come awake watch the attacks
[1:17:23] begin to flow what's the criticism begin
[1:17:25] to come watch the enemy wake up then
[1:17:27] because he hates that somebody has come
[1:17:30] down to see about the well-being of the
[1:17:31] people that the spirits begin to move in
[1:17:33] that place and heal the sick and deliver
[1:17:35] the bound and save the laws and suddenly
[1:17:38] the enemy's like oh no what's going on
[1:17:40] over there it's fanaticism what do you
[1:17:42] even try to do who called you to this
[1:17:44] the king called us to this the king said
[1:17:47] restore the king said revealed the king
[1:17:50] said the wall could be built back up
[1:17:52] that's who did it I say wake up sleep in
[1:17:55] churches wake up and let the spirit move
[1:17:58] what meanest thou old sleeper the ship
[1:18:01] sink and Blake doesn't call on your God
[1:18:04] wake up
[1:18:05] [Applause]
[1:18:11] suddenly those Spirits begin to rise up
[1:18:13] and make themselves known
[1:18:15] and try to cast out on the work that's
[1:18:16] going on there
[1:18:19] oh it's all emotional work up
[1:18:24] chapter 2 verse 19 in Nehemiah
[1:18:30] but when sand ballot the horror night
[1:18:32] and tobiah the servant the ammonite and
[1:18:35] gesham the Arabian heard it
[1:18:38] what they heard was that they were
[1:18:40] rebuilding the wall
[1:18:42] they laughed us to scorn
[1:18:45] and despised us and said
[1:18:48] what is this thing you're doing
[1:18:50] what is this
[1:18:52] worship y'all have going on
[1:18:55] what is all this praying for the sick
[1:18:59] hey what are you what are you doing
[1:19:01] and they laughed
[1:19:03] and they mocked and they made fun
[1:19:07] and they didn't
[1:19:08] think about nothing until Nehemiah
[1:19:09] showed up
[1:19:11] what no issue just somebody came to
[1:19:12] check on the welfare of the people
[1:19:14] oh but suddenly let's Mock and let's
[1:19:16] make fun
[1:19:17] then answered I them
[1:19:19] and said unto them the god of Heaven he
[1:19:23] will prosper us therefore we his
[1:19:25] servants will arise and we will build
[1:19:28] I ain't worried about what you're saying
[1:19:30] God's going to prosper us I've seen the
[1:19:33] sick healed I've seen the law saved I've
[1:19:34] seen Dry Bones come to life I've seen
[1:19:36] young people filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:19:38] God's going to prosper us you know what
[1:19:40] I'm going to do I'm Gonna Keep right on
[1:19:41] building I'm Gonna Keep rising up above
[1:19:43] the criticism I'm not looking left I'm
[1:19:45] not looking right I'm just here to build
[1:19:47] tonight I'm just here to add another
[1:19:49] Stone on I'm here to do my part arise
[1:19:53] and build
[1:19:57] he says
[1:19:58] and this is very important and very
[1:20:01] dangerous
[1:20:02] he says but you have no portion
[1:20:05] nor right nor Memorial in Jerusalem
[1:20:11] you have no place here
[1:20:14] this is a scary thought
[1:20:17] when the bride does the work
[1:20:19] that she's been called to do
[1:20:21] when she begins to operate in the
[1:20:23] ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:20:25] when the signs begin to follow when the
[1:20:28] gifts are manifested when demons are
[1:20:31] cast out
[1:20:33] those that have no portion in the New
[1:20:35] Jerusalem Will Mock and make fun of it
[1:20:40] he says you have no portion
[1:20:42] you're laughing and mocking at the wall
[1:20:44] being built back up that's okay
[1:20:46] you don't even have a place here
[1:20:50] you don't have to worry about what's
[1:20:51] going to take place inside these walls
[1:20:53] you're not going to be there is what
[1:20:55] he's telling them
[1:20:57] and it's okay they wouldn't want to be
[1:20:58] there anyway because that's how it's
[1:21:00] going to be in heaven there's going to
[1:21:01] be lots of shouting and jumping and
[1:21:03] running and screaming and praising God
[1:21:04] and if you don't like it here you
[1:21:06] wouldn't like it there so don't worry
[1:21:07] about it you have no portion or Memorial
[1:21:10] there
[1:21:18] when I was sitting there reading this in
[1:21:20] the study today this just hit me
[1:21:22] so hard look over in Genesis
[1:21:24] 21-9
[1:21:26] and you see this very thing
[1:21:29] acted out again
[1:21:31] and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the
[1:21:33] Egyptian which she had borne unto
[1:21:35] Abraham mocking
[1:21:37] wherefore she said unto Abraham cast out
[1:21:40] this Bond woman and her son for the son
[1:21:42] of this Bond woman shall not be heirs
[1:21:45] with my son with Isaac
[1:21:48] when you see the mocking and the
[1:21:51] laughing and the
[1:21:54] it's easy to place that in Scripture
[1:21:57] it's very obvious
[1:21:59] so don't get turned to the side by that
[1:22:01] don't be worried about that look brother
[1:22:03] Brown preaches on it uh quite a bit in
[1:22:06] the name of the sermon escapes me right
[1:22:08] now but but he talks about in the last
[1:22:09] days he's bringing it there from Peter
[1:22:12] how mockers are going to be there you
[1:22:14] can't have the last days without mockers
[1:22:16] being there
[1:22:18] it's part of it's part of the word that
[1:22:20] part of the word is going to be
[1:22:21] fulfilled too that part of the words got
[1:22:24] to be fulfilled but there are a people
[1:22:26] that are called for the work there are
[1:22:29] people called for the restoration there
[1:22:32] are people when they hear that message
[1:22:34] and the message says the king told me
[1:22:36] this notice Nehemiah didn't even pull
[1:22:38] out the papers he didn't even have a
[1:22:40] picture he said these are the words of
[1:22:42] the king an angel visited me in my cave
[1:22:45] he sent me into the world the king's
[1:22:48] sword came down in my hand that's good
[1:22:50] enough for me that's good enough for me
[1:22:52] I say Rise From the Ashes get behind
[1:22:55] this one and rebuild be a part of the
[1:22:57] restoration the king sent a message
[1:23:00] he sent a message and I will not mock I
[1:23:03] will not make fun of I will not question
[1:23:04] I'll just say yes Lord I accept it I
[1:23:08] take it from me for my family we will
[1:23:11] build
[1:23:12] Hallelujah
[1:23:13] [Applause]
[1:23:15] these people recognize who they are and
[1:23:17] in so doing they recognize what they are
[1:23:19] supposed to do
[1:23:21] and nothing no amount of sickness no
[1:23:24] amount of demons no amount of Hell on
[1:23:26] Earth will keep them from finishing the
[1:23:28] work
[1:23:30] brother Brown says in the carrying away
[1:23:32] of Babylon remember if God has a work
[1:23:34] for you to do all the demons out of
[1:23:36] Torment can't take you they just can't
[1:23:38] startle you in any way God's got a
[1:23:40] purpose for the Holy Ghost Church and
[1:23:43] all the Devils of Hell will never be
[1:23:44] able to take it away God's got a purpose
[1:23:47] for it and it will never be destroyed
[1:23:50] until God lets it fulfill the purpose
[1:23:52] that he is ordained to do it and it will
[1:23:57] it will
[1:23:58] nothing's going to stop us church we
[1:24:01] will finish their work we will fulfill
[1:24:03] what we're called to do he said nothing
[1:24:05] can stop it until his purpose is
[1:24:07] fulfilled and it will be fulfilled
[1:24:12] it's more than knowing it's more than
[1:24:14] recognizing
[1:24:15] but tonight you got to put your hands to
[1:24:17] the work Lord what part am I supposed to
[1:24:20] fulfill what part am I supposed to play
[1:24:23] because we have to be the ones that
[1:24:25] fulfill oh
[1:24:29] brother Branham over and over again when
[1:24:31] speaking on the baptism of Jesus would
[1:24:34] emphasize and I know I've already read
[1:24:35] one quote on this if I want to read it
[1:24:37] again
[1:24:38] that they both had the revelation of who
[1:24:40] each other were
[1:24:42] and Jesus would tell John it's because
[1:24:44] of who we are that this has to be this
[1:24:47] way
[1:24:49] he says let God live in you to vindicate
[1:24:52] the promises of this day just as John as
[1:24:55] Jesus said to John suffer it to be so
[1:24:58] John that's right but we are the
[1:25:00] messengers of this day we've got to
[1:25:02] fulfill all righteousness and if we are
[1:25:04] the Christians of this day let's receive
[1:25:07] Jesus Christ into our heart and he is
[1:25:09] the word don't deny any of it say it's
[1:25:12] the truth and place it in your heart
[1:25:13] watch the fruit of the spirit upon you
[1:25:16] fulfill every promise that he made in
[1:25:19] the Bible God wants to fulfill his word
[1:25:22] and he don't have any hands but mine and
[1:25:24] yours he don't have any eyes but mine
[1:25:27] and yours and he don't have no tongue
[1:25:29] but mine are yours he's still want his
[1:25:32] word fulfilled but he needs somebody
[1:25:34] that will yield their vessel to him and
[1:25:36] say Lord Here I Am Lord Use Me Lord work
[1:25:39] through me I want to see it fulfilled
[1:25:41] Lord I want to see every word fulfilled
[1:25:44] I want all righteousness fulfilled Use
[1:25:46] Me Lord
[1:25:50] he says for nearly 2 000 years God has
[1:25:53] been again making him a masterpiece
[1:25:54] because he struck Adam to get a
[1:25:57] masterpiece off of him a rib to make a
[1:25:59] wife for him and now that perfect
[1:26:01] Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he
[1:26:03] got a piece off of him it's just the New
[1:26:06] Testament that's all he fulfilled the
[1:26:08] Old Testament now it's the New Testament
[1:26:10] another piece to be fulfilled see the
[1:26:13] new and oldest husband and wife see in
[1:26:16] it take the old to foreshadow the new
[1:26:18] Christ come the Masterpiece to fulfill
[1:26:20] that now his bride will fulfill
[1:26:23] everything that's in the New Testament
[1:26:28] oh
[1:26:32] I don't want to leave anything
[1:26:33] unfulfilled
[1:26:35] knowing that that responsibility sits
[1:26:37] Upon Our shoulders I don't want to leave
[1:26:38] anything unfulfilled I don't want to
[1:26:40] leave anything undone I don't want to
[1:26:42] leave one promise unclaimed I don't want
[1:26:44] to leave one devil unconquered listen
[1:26:46] that's what this bride's going to do
[1:26:48] every promise will be claimed every
[1:26:50] every devil will be conquered she's
[1:26:52] going to leave out of here a Victorious
[1:26:53] bride because that's the will of the
[1:26:55] father
[1:26:56] look all the ages before us left things
[1:26:58] undone
[1:27:00] every age before us left things undone
[1:27:03] they left promises unclaimed and they
[1:27:05] left word unfulfilled because they
[1:27:08] operated underneath portions
[1:27:11] they operated underneath gifts and
[1:27:13] manifestations and portions of the word
[1:27:20] and because of this they weren't under
[1:27:22] the same anointing that we're under I
[1:27:24] would call it under the fullness
[1:27:27] of the same anointing that we're
[1:27:29] underneath that you and I have today and
[1:27:31] so in every age there was always more to
[1:27:34] come
[1:27:35] there was always something else coming
[1:27:38] but this day this message didn't call
[1:27:41] the people so we can look to something
[1:27:42] else coming in this age this is the
[1:27:44] finishing message in the days of the
[1:27:46] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:27:48] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[1:27:50] be finished this is the finishing age
[1:27:53] this is the finishing time you are a
[1:27:55] finishing people there's not another
[1:27:57] people to come we can't perpetuate the
[1:27:59] ages we can't keep pushing it off it's
[1:28:02] you it's me it's us it's now it's time
[1:28:06] we have to fulfill all righteousness
[1:28:10] it's called the people in this day like
[1:28:12] those on the wall and nehemiah's day
[1:28:13] that wouldn't come off the wall until
[1:28:15] the work was done
[1:28:16] they wouldn't back down until it was
[1:28:18] finished
[1:28:20] churches churches
[1:28:22] Brides brides
[1:28:24] listen down Through the Ages
[1:28:27] look David had been anointing but he
[1:28:29] failed
[1:28:30] Sampson had been anointed but he fell
[1:28:32] the devil had seen anointed men before
[1:28:35] but he'd never seen one like Jesus
[1:28:38] no there'd never been one like that man
[1:28:40] well oh and he's seeing churches there's
[1:28:43] been anointed churches he's seen Luther
[1:28:44] anointed but they denominated he saw
[1:28:47] Wesley anointed but they denominated he
[1:28:49] saw Pentecost with the gifts but they
[1:28:51] denominated but he ain't seen one like
[1:28:54] this one it's more than a gift it's more
[1:28:56] than Justified it's more than Sanctified
[1:28:58] it's bone of his bone blessed of his
[1:29:01] flesh power of his power she is him he
[1:29:05] ain't seen one like this before oh this
[1:29:08] ain't just some denominational church
[1:29:09] that's going to go down the scene
[1:29:11] already went down and I can tell you
[1:29:13] tonight the seed is up the seed is up
[1:29:16] the seed is up this is that this is the
[1:29:20] one that went down back again
[1:29:23] Hallelujah he ain't seen one like you
[1:29:25] before
[1:29:26] he ain't seen one like this before
[1:29:29] Glory
[1:29:35] she has the word
[1:29:36] and she knows what he wants done with it
[1:29:39] and it behooves us to fulfill all
[1:29:41] righteousness
[1:29:44] you know we always talk about the word
[1:29:46] being a mirror
[1:29:48] you hear that a lot of times
[1:29:50] the word is it's a mirror look into the
[1:29:53] mirror of the word and we often use it
[1:29:54] when we're talking about lining up
[1:29:57] you know this is how Christians should
[1:29:58] look
[1:29:59] look at the word this is how Christians
[1:30:00] should act look at the word and I need
[1:30:02] those things in my life sure
[1:30:04] that's a great way to use it
[1:30:07] but how about we start looking into the
[1:30:08] mirror
[1:30:09] and seeing the same victory
[1:30:13] I see the same victory in his life that
[1:30:17] I have in my life when I see him conquer
[1:30:19] death I conquer death he conquered hell
[1:30:22] I conquered hell he conquered the grave
[1:30:24] I don't have to go there he overcame
[1:30:26] Satan he defeated him with the word I'm
[1:30:28] just looking in the mirror that's me I'm
[1:30:30] an overcomer that's my bridegroom that's
[1:30:34] who I am that's who I'm going to be with
[1:30:36] and I'm going to finish his work I'm
[1:30:38] going to finish his ministry he tore
[1:30:40] down Satan's kingdom let me tear down
[1:30:43] Satan's kingdom there is a work for me
[1:30:46] to do in this day
[1:30:48] and I'm gonna do it
[1:30:51] I'm gonna get on the wall
[1:30:55] he says and as he being the groom
[1:30:58] the bride has to come forth because it's
[1:31:00] part of him
[1:31:01] and it can only be the manifestation of
[1:31:03] the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:31:05] any others has spoke of the Bride it can
[1:31:09] only manifest
[1:31:10] if it does something different from the
[1:31:12] groom it isn't the bride because she is
[1:31:15] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life
[1:31:17] of his life power of his power she is
[1:31:22] him
[1:31:24] no longer in portions like it was down
[1:31:27] Through the Ages
[1:31:29] under Luther and Wesley they couldn't
[1:31:31] finish the work
[1:31:32] they operated under portions they
[1:31:34] couldn't fulfill the Great Commission
[1:31:35] even
[1:31:37] they couldn't do it they couldn't
[1:31:38] fulfill John 14 12.
[1:31:40] sure there was anointing men in every
[1:31:42] age that did works of God Mighty works
[1:31:44] of God
[1:31:45] we take nothing away from that
[1:31:48] but the greater part of John 14 12 Finds
[1:31:52] Its fulfillment
[1:31:54] in the fullness of his coming
[1:31:57] The Works that I do shall you do also an
[1:32:00] even greater
[1:32:01] the greater part
[1:32:03] Finds Its fulfillment
[1:32:05] in the fullness
[1:32:06] of his coming
[1:32:08] how can we do all the works of Christ
[1:32:11] if the fullness of Christ had not yet
[1:32:13] come
[1:32:15] so it could not be fulfilled in any
[1:32:16] other age
[1:32:18] but in this age
[1:32:19] it's the fullness of the manifestation
[1:32:22] of the son of man Ministry
[1:32:24] third pull
[1:32:25] that's how these things are to be
[1:32:27] manifested in this day time after time
[1:32:30] brother Brandon would put John 14 12
[1:32:32] with the other end time scriptures you
[1:32:34] can go and find this for yourself here's
[1:32:36] one example he says remember what time
[1:32:38] is it sir how many ever heard it say
[1:32:41] Amen was it exactly right then we've got
[1:32:43] the Revelation in the last days for the
[1:32:46] message of the Lord God to gather his
[1:32:48] bride together no other age has it been
[1:32:51] promised it's promised in this age
[1:32:54] Malachi 4 said Luke 17 30 Saint John 14
[1:32:59] 12 Joel 2 38.
[1:33:03] why now brother Aaron why now because
[1:33:06] this is the Omega Church
[1:33:08] this is the seed that went down come up
[1:33:11] again finishing the unfinished works of
[1:33:15] the bridegroom
[1:33:18] oh we're running out of time
[1:33:28] the revelation of who you are isn't to
[1:33:29] Puff you up
[1:33:31] it isn't to make you an intellectual
[1:33:34] it isn't to give you a head knowledge
[1:33:36] with a better Doctrine than somebody
[1:33:38] else the revelation of who you are is to
[1:33:41] show you what you are to fulfill
[1:33:45] that's why brother Branham says that
[1:33:46] when she recognizes who she is how
[1:33:49] what's he tied this to recognition
[1:33:52] then she can do
[1:33:55] the Greater Works
[1:33:56] there's a tie right there it's not just
[1:33:58] to recognize it's to recognize so that
[1:34:00] you know what to do recognize to know
[1:34:02] how to how to do it the king's message
[1:34:04] comes to strengthen your hands for work
[1:34:07] not just so that you know things and so
[1:34:10] we've received the king's message and
[1:34:12] once again I say let the mockers mock I
[1:34:14] know where this message came from let
[1:34:16] them make fun of the work that's fine
[1:34:18] this work has been commissioned by the
[1:34:20] king it's been commissioned by God
[1:34:22] Almighty the the bride is doing what the
[1:34:25] groom did
[1:34:26] and what the groom would do if he were
[1:34:29] here in his coreful body
[1:34:31] she's doing the exact same thing he says
[1:34:34] it has to be because a woman and her
[1:34:35] husband become one they become one and
[1:34:38] so does the Bride In Christ become one
[1:34:39] the ministry of the bride and the
[1:34:41] ministry of Christ is the same the hour
[1:34:44] that we're living oh God the world is
[1:34:46] falling apart there hangs in the hangers
[1:34:48] bombs there hangs the thing to do just
[1:34:50] exactly the church is ready she sealed
[1:34:52] in ready to come there will be a big
[1:34:54] outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab
[1:34:57] that church and take her into the skies
[1:34:58] exactly because see the church the word
[1:35:01] the bride and Christ his ministry is in
[1:35:04] the bride which is his body
[1:35:07] he says the celestial body I mean to say
[1:35:10] the supernatural body of his here on the
[1:35:12] spiritual body on Earth his spirit is in
[1:35:15] there living his life right out until
[1:35:18] him in the church becomes one
[1:35:21] in the wedding
[1:35:24] you know the people that were called by
[1:35:26] nehemiah's message had a mind to work
[1:35:29] that was an anointing
[1:35:31] they were under to work driven to finish
[1:35:34] what the father had given them to do
[1:35:36] there's a people today driven to finish
[1:35:38] the work
[1:35:39] keep building
[1:35:41] keep focused
[1:35:42] get to the goal finish driven to work
[1:35:46] push to go another step some days you
[1:35:48] don't feel like it just take another
[1:35:50] step keep fighting keep going get the
[1:35:53] wall closed in get everything placed

[1:35:58] another step listen it has to be made
[1:36:00] ready it has to be fulfilled what is it
[1:36:02] driving it's the same exact thing that
[1:36:04] drove Jesus
[1:36:06] he says Jesus saith unto them my meat is
[1:36:08] to do the will of him that sent me and
[1:36:10] to finish his work
[1:36:12] and just like the groom what drives us
[1:36:15] the bride is to finish his work if
[1:36:17] that's his will and he says that the
[1:36:19] bride has his word and she knows what he
[1:36:21] wants done with it he wants his Works
[1:36:24] finished he wants all righteousness
[1:36:26] fulfilled and he has a bride on Earth
[1:36:28] that says I'll do it Lord I'll do it
[1:36:31] I'll fulfill the word I'll go to work

[1:37:49] what others are doing
[1:37:54] Focus
[1:37:58] don't be distracted
[1:38:01] get your mind back on the work
[1:38:03] Nehemiah 4 1 as I try to bring this down
[1:38:07] it says but it came to pass that when
[1:38:09] Sam Ballard heard that we builded the
[1:38:11] wall this is at the completion of it
[1:38:14] he was Roth
[1:38:16] and took great indignation
[1:38:18] and mocked the Jews
[1:38:21] and he spaked before his brethren in the
[1:38:23] army of Samaria and said what do these
[1:38:26] feeble Jews will they fortify themselves
[1:38:28] in that how many times have you heard
[1:38:30] that
[1:38:31] when the devil's losing he wants to come
[1:38:33] and start making it personal oh you're
[1:38:34] so weak
[1:38:36] you don't have any real Faith who are
[1:38:37] you
[1:38:38] feeble Jews
[1:38:40] what do you think you're going to do
[1:38:43] see at this point in the story
[1:38:52] I said what do you think you're doing
[1:38:55] what do you think you're going to do
[1:38:56] these walls they're going to fall down
[1:38:57] one over me it says there's a fox runs
[1:38:59] into your wall it's just going to tip it
[1:39:00] over
[1:39:01] it's it's it's weak because see when you
[1:39:04] start doing the work that's commissioned
[1:39:05] by the king there will be mocking
[1:39:09] oh you think you can do the Greater
[1:39:10] Works okay
[1:39:12] oh you think they're still tongues in
[1:39:13] interpretation you think prayer lines
[1:39:15] altar call you think you can still
[1:39:17] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:39:19] now we've matured beyond that
[1:39:21] we we we're beyond that oh you think you
[1:39:24] can still be healed this message has so
[1:39:27] many flaws in it
[1:39:28] oh the messenger is so flawed
[1:39:32] there's so many and they point and they
[1:39:34] attack and they come to see what it is
[1:39:38] at this point in the story
[1:39:41] sand ballot
[1:39:42] and his other friend whose name's not
[1:39:45] out there and who I currently have
[1:39:46] forgotten
[1:39:47] are actually extremely worried
[1:39:50] because they're still saying all the
[1:39:52] same stuff they've been saying
[1:39:54] but in just a matter of days all of a
[1:39:56] sudden
[1:39:57] there's a wall
[1:39:59] there's a wall there
[1:40:01] and this reminds me very much of the
[1:40:03] exact same thing that happens when
[1:40:04] someone comes up and they're dealing
[1:40:05] with the spirit and you begin to deal
[1:40:06] with that spirit and he begins to say I
[1:40:09] won't come out
[1:40:10] oh we've seen it too many times I won't
[1:40:13] let her go I won't come out of it he's
[1:40:16] saying these things because he knows
[1:40:17] it's over
[1:40:19] it's finished and the last thing he
[1:40:22] might could do is possibly Bluff you
[1:40:23] enough to get you to back off I got news
[1:40:26] for you buddy we ain't backing off we
[1:40:28] ain't backing up we got you on the ropes
[1:40:31] we got you on the roach and we're in the
[1:40:33] final line and we ain't backing up we
[1:40:35] ain't giving in the wall is built the
[1:40:37] wall has been restored and we're
[1:40:39] standing on it and from up here I can
[1:40:41] see a mighty long way I can see King
[1:40:43] Jesus coming I can see a body King I can
[1:40:46] see a Rapture I'm not coming off this
[1:40:49] wall I'm not backing up I'm not backing
[1:40:52] down don't worry they're scared they're
[1:40:55] on the ropes
[1:40:56] they see the gaps closing they see Power
[1:40:59] being restored they see people operating
[1:41:02] in power
[1:41:05] and they're worried and they continue to
[1:41:06] try to mock
[1:41:09] and the wall grows stronger
[1:41:11] and stronger
[1:41:13] and stronger
[1:41:15] so the enemy at this point begins to
[1:41:16] send raids
[1:41:19] they begin to send raids and to try to
[1:41:21] attack the workers
[1:41:23] try to stop the work
[1:41:26] but the workers just arm themselves
[1:41:29] all workers just take up a sword
[1:41:31] they just take up Swords when they go to
[1:41:33] work on Monday morning they take up
[1:41:35] Swords when they go to school they take
[1:41:37] up Swords when they're mixing mud they
[1:41:39] take up Swords when they go shopping
[1:41:40] they take up Swords while they're trying
[1:41:42] to teach their and homeschool their kids
[1:41:43] and while they're holding the sword they
[1:41:45] teach their kids how to swing The Sword
[1:41:47] and everybody knows how to swing The
[1:41:48] Sword and they're like come on come on

[1:43:02] telling you we're ready for him
[1:43:05] five different times sand ballot his
[1:43:07] Confederates challenged Nehemiah and the
[1:43:09] Jews to meet them in battle
[1:43:11] out in the plains
[1:43:13] why
[1:43:15] it had nothing to do with literally
[1:43:17] wanting to fight it had to do with
[1:43:18] wanting to get them off the wall
[1:43:21] to distract them from the work that they
[1:43:23] were doing
[1:43:24] but he would not be distracted
[1:43:27] all right listen you can't get caught up
[1:43:29] in drama
[1:43:31] well they said this about me and this
[1:43:33] church over here says this about this
[1:43:35] church and that church and that Pastor
[1:43:36] don't agree and they said something
[1:43:38] about me and they did this and they did
[1:43:40] that and the devil keeps saying somebody
[1:43:42] in the midst of all that because that
[1:43:43] goes on in every life
[1:43:45] that stuff
[1:43:47] but somebody's gonna go
[1:43:49] I gotta work I gotta finish
[1:43:51] I got a Waldo I got a bill I'm not
[1:43:53] coming off this wall to deal with that
[1:43:55] nonsense I'm not coming out into the
[1:43:56] valley to fight you right now I'm
[1:43:57] building a wall I'm going to do the
[1:43:59] works that he did I'm going to fulfill
[1:44:01] all righteousness I'm going to overcome
[1:44:03] I'm gonna Rapture that's where I'm at
[1:44:06] give me another brick

[1:44:09] this saying that give me another brick
[1:44:11] I'm Gonna Keep On Building I'm gonna
[1:44:13] finish this race well
[1:44:16] listen we're in a fight
[1:44:18] and brother Timothy said it best he said
[1:44:20] let's make it a good fight
[1:44:22] let's make it a good fight
[1:44:25] Acts 20 22
[1:44:28] I was just thinking about Paul and how
[1:44:30] we all have something to finish and he
[1:44:31] says and now behold I go Bound in the
[1:44:33] spirit unto Jerusalem
[1:44:36] not knowing the things that shall befall
[1:44:38] me there saved at the Holy Ghost
[1:44:40] Witnesses in every city saying that
[1:44:42] bonds and afflictions abide me but none
[1:44:45] of these things moved me neither count I
[1:44:48] my life dear unto myself so that I might
[1:44:51] finish my course with joy and the
[1:44:53] ministry which I have received of the
[1:44:55] Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the
[1:44:58] grace of God
[1:45:00] Paul says I'm going bound
[1:45:02] I don't even know what's going to happen
[1:45:04] to me I don't know how bad I'm gonna be
[1:45:06] beat I don't know how bad I'm gonna be
[1:45:08] scourged and none of that even matters
[1:45:10] to me he said I ain't worried about it
[1:45:12] none I don't even care about my own life
[1:45:15] he says just let me run just let me
[1:45:19] finish what God called me to finish it
[1:45:22] doesn't matter what it cost me in this
[1:45:23] Earthly life Paul says I just want to
[1:45:25] finish strong I just want to finish well
[1:45:27] Lord let me do my part let me finish
[1:45:30] what you called me here to finish
[1:45:34] I could put my voice there with Paul I
[1:45:36] know others ran their race others stood
[1:45:38] the test others did their part now it's
[1:45:41] our turn
[1:45:43] now we're on the wall
[1:45:45] the wall stained with the blood of
[1:45:46] Martyrs
[1:45:49] staying with the blood of others that
[1:45:50] have gone before life's given races will
[1:45:53] run just like brother Brown
[1:45:55] Paul ranwell Luther ran well Wesley
[1:45:57] ranwell William Branham ran well
[1:45:59] now you're on the wall
[1:46:02] brother Brown says as I said this
[1:46:04] morning in the message in our message
[1:46:05] this morning it behooveth us it's
[1:46:08] becoming to us that we fulfill all
[1:46:10] righteousness it's up to us to whom the
[1:46:12] word has been delivered to it's up to us
[1:46:14] that we stay with that word and as we
[1:46:17] stay with it we see God working Among Us
[1:46:20] so it's becoming to us to stay with it I
[1:46:24] love this part it's a Heritage that God
[1:46:27] has given us
[1:46:29] it's a heritage
[1:46:32] those are my people as we might say
[1:46:35] those are my brothers that stood to
[1:46:37] build this wall
[1:46:38] I'm not giving none of it back
[1:46:40] you can't have one stone
[1:46:42] as a matter of fact I'm adding to it
[1:46:44] we're strengthening we're building up
[1:46:47] makes me think of Abraham Lincoln in the
[1:46:49] Gettysburg address where he made these
[1:46:51] famous words he said it is for us the
[1:46:52] living
[1:46:53] rather to be dedicated here to The
[1:46:56] Unfinished work which they who fought
[1:46:58] here have thus far so nobly advanced it
[1:47:02] is rather for us to be here dedicated to
[1:47:04] the great task remaining before us that
[1:47:06] from these honored dead we take
[1:47:08] increased Devotion to that cause for
[1:47:11] which they gave the last full measure of
[1:47:15] devotion
[1:47:17] give it your all
[1:47:19] give it your everything
[1:47:21] don't leave nothing undone
[1:47:23] don't leave one promise unclaimed
[1:47:26] don't leave one devil hiding in your
[1:47:28] life defeat it all
[1:47:29] others have given all
[1:47:31] give your everything
[1:47:33] give your everything
[1:47:35] tonight the musicians can come
[1:47:37] there's an unfinished work
[1:47:40] but there's a people called to finish it
[1:47:43] there's a people called to finish the
[1:47:45] work
[1:47:46] The Works that I do shall you do also
[1:47:49] and greater
[1:47:51] that's our section right there
[1:47:54] that's where we're at
[1:47:56] that's the section that we're fulfilling
[1:47:59] brother Brown says I declare to you
[1:48:00] tonight my dear brother that the works
[1:48:02] that Jesus Christ did he never finished
[1:48:03] them he finished his life at the cross
[1:48:06] that he might pour it back into you
[1:48:08] and the church would do the same thing
[1:48:11] he did how long brother Aaron until he
[1:48:15] comes again oh but we don't do these
[1:48:18] things because it's after 1963 because
[1:48:20] until he comes
[1:48:23] again
[1:48:26] I'm still here
[1:48:27] we're still here
[1:48:29] so the work isn't finished
[1:48:31] there's still more that we can do what
[1:48:34] are you saying tonight brother Aaron
[1:48:35] build
[1:48:37] don't be distracted well I'm waiting on
[1:48:39] the Lord I'm waiting on no actually and
[1:48:41] I'm not going to get into it I got quote
[1:48:42] after quote after quote right here that
[1:48:44] says the Lord is waiting on you
[1:48:48] he says the bride hath made
[1:48:51] herself ready
[1:48:54] by finishing the works by taking the
[1:48:57] word and put it into action
[1:49:00] my closing quote says what difference
[1:49:02] does it make whether we got a nickel or
[1:49:04] a dime whether we got something to eat
[1:49:06] or whether we haven't whether we're
[1:49:08] living or Dying God promised the meek
[1:49:10] shall inherit the earth it behooveth us
[1:49:12] it's becoming to us that we live like it
[1:49:15] act like it that we fulfill all
[1:49:17] righteousness God wants men and women
[1:49:19] who will stand and fulfill all
[1:49:22] righteousness of course righteousness is
[1:49:25] his word are we ready to stand tonight
[1:49:28] if you'll stand with me to your feet as
[1:49:30] we close this
[1:49:31] a people he said that will stand and
[1:49:33] fulfill all righteousness
[1:49:35] a people ready to fulfill all of people
[1:49:38] ready to give their everything
[1:49:40] I'm waiting on him brother Aaron no he's
[1:49:43] waiting on a people
[1:49:44] to fulfill what he left for them to
[1:49:47] fulfill
[1:49:48] Nehemiah 6 15 so the wall was finished
[1:49:51] in the 20th and fifth day of the month
[1:49:53] ELO in 50 and two days and it came to
[1:49:57] pass that when all our enemies heard
[1:49:59] thereof and all the Heathen that were
[1:50:01] about us saw these things they were much
[1:50:03] cast down in their own eyes for they
[1:50:06] perceived that this work was wrought of
[1:50:10] our God
[1:50:12] the bride is fulfilling John 14 12. the
[1:50:15] bride is allowing him to live through
[1:50:16] her and Conquer through her and the work
[1:50:18] is being wrapped up by people who have a
[1:50:20] mind of work and the enemy is saying
[1:50:22] this work is being wrought by their God
[1:50:25] and their eyes are cast down they know
[1:50:28] what's done is of the Lord they know
[1:50:30] that you can't orchestrate these things
[1:50:31] they know these things aren't a man but
[1:50:34] what are we called to do today
[1:50:37] finish
[1:50:39] build they have the word and they know
[1:50:42] what he wants done with it it's not to
[1:50:44] collect tapes
[1:50:46] but it's to put the word in action
[1:50:49] the word and flesh in action
[1:50:53] you know we talked about the very
[1:50:54] beginning being doers and not just
[1:50:56] hearers
[1:50:57] you know some of the things we read in
[1:50:59] the books in the Bible that seems so
[1:51:01] marvelous so amazing so outstanding
[1:51:04] really we don't have to do anything
[1:51:05] special all we have to do is just be a
[1:51:08] doer of the word
[1:51:09] you don't even have to defend
[1:51:11] the miraculous it's in the word
[1:51:14] you don't have to defend your worship
[1:51:16] we're just doing what the word said
[1:51:19] it's in the word Even in our praise it's
[1:51:22] literally just putting the word in
[1:51:23] action the word says Praise Him in the
[1:51:24] dance
[1:51:25] the word says shout if I just do what
[1:51:28] the word says that's how I'm going to
[1:51:29] worship
[1:51:31] you don't have to defend it let the word
[1:51:33] do it it says everything that has breath
[1:51:34] praise ye the Lord so when you're asked
[1:51:37] that the entire congregation lift up
[1:51:39] your voice we're just asking you to do
[1:51:40] what the word said
[1:51:42] we're just wanting to be doers of the
[1:51:45] word
[1:51:46] the word promised gifts
[1:51:49] we're just expecting it because the word
[1:51:50] said so
[1:51:52] you know gifts being in the word don't
[1:51:55] never bother anybody until they actually
[1:51:56] start to happen they don't mind reading
[1:51:59] it
[1:52:00] the word says lay hands on the sick
[1:52:03] we're just putting the word in action
[1:52:06] and that's all you have to do to fulfill
[1:52:09] all righteousness
[1:52:11] just say Lord my hands are available
[1:52:14] my body is available and I just want to
[1:52:17] put the word in action
