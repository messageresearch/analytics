Save The Lost Lord deliver the bound we pray we ask it in Jesus name amen amen let's turn to John Chapter 14 verse one amen John Chapter 14 verse one i' like to speak to you this evening on faith brings peace amen Faith brings peace John chapter 14 and verse one says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in Me In My Father's House house or many mansions if it were not so I would have told you but I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know down to verse 25 these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father was send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid amen we'll let you be seated we could of course read the scriptures in Timothy and Daniel of the last days perilous time shall come and or a time of trouble such as never was seen and we know that we're living in that time we're living at the very closing of time and and we know that it's getting darker and darker as each day progresses you know and many times when we don't uh when we don't see how things will turn out or we don't know how things are going to turn out we tend to worry and we tend to fret and this allows doubt to rise in our hearts and because we can't see with our eyes and how the story ends you know it it allows doubt to come and and and if you're not careful it'll it'll turn even to to unbelief you know I was I was looking at this thought and I ran across something that was very interesting I I've heard about this before of of a moose how a moose is very dangerous actually if you're up there in the in the in the north there in the in the winter country and things and on the snowmobile or skis you have to watch out for them more than you do grizzly bears and the reason why is they they're so aggressive is they don't have good eyesight and a moose you know it's becomes very aggressive because it has poor eyesight and and and when you have poor eyesight you view everything is a threat and you know and when we can't see the future we tend to feel threatened you know if we don't know how things will go worry sets in and we become afraid and and we and you know maybe don't know how the empy how our employment is going to go or job's going to go or how our life's going to turn out and and we feel threatened but God gives us an alter alternative to this feeling of threatened or being afraid and that's to trust amen you know Faith brings trust and Trust brings fa uh peace trust isn't something you can choose because you feel like it amen it's not something that you choose because you feel like trusting but we have faith in a God who has a word that will not fail and we trust though we cannot see with our natural senses and and we can have a peace in the middle of our storm and you choose to believe no matter what and Trust follows see faith is something you choose even when you feel anything but calm amen you choose it even if you feel worry or you feel doubt creeping in amen you have to turn back to Faith and that faith will bring a trust and that trust will bring a peace even when you cannot see the answer even though the circumstances are blurry and your vision of of the of the future is unclear faith will give you a trust and Trust will give you a peace we can read that about that in Isaiah chapter 26 and verse three it says Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he what trusteth in thee amen because of this trust it brings a perfect peace amen that in the middle of struggles in the mid of perilous times or uh time uh uh the time like of trouble like never before amen we can still have a trust because there's a word that cannot fail there's a God who stands behind his word and it's what he said in John Chapter 14 verse 27 he said Peace I give I live with thee my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid in other words this isn't a peace P that that's that depending upon how the world is going or how the economy is going or how things are around you and your circumstances this ain't the peace that he gives us you know if we're depending on our own peace and our own comfort and things you know it can only it's only a temporary thing cuz sooner or later you go through a trial you go through sickness you go through something you didn't see coming and then that peace will leave you but if you have the peace of God in your heart that peace of God is Not depending upon what the world is doing or what the world is saying or how it's How many missiles are being fired here or what's happening over here that peace of God is depending only upon his word and that word has never failed one time that word is something we can stand upon Amen in the darkest of hours and the darkest of times it's something that you can really trust you may not can trust man's words or the president's words or or or anybody's words but you can trust God's word because he cannot lie he said if it wasn't the truth I would have told you so I would have told you amen exactly what was going to be and this is the way where he was telling us let not your heart be troubled but believe in me have faith in me that I'm going to go and prepare a place for you and there where I am you may be also cuz in my father's house are many mansions I don't know about you but I I like how it's been said before I'm not looking for necessarily a great Mansion a five bedroom room house or or whatever I'm looking for a mansion about this tall and dark-headed Dark Eyed Amen in perfect health and perfect peace never have a brain a mind trouble or or never have heart trouble never have anything like that again no sickness no worry that's the kind of mansion I'm looking for I don't know about you but I don't I ain't interested in exactly what house I'm going to live in or if there even be a house I'm not worried about all of that I know he has went to prepare me a Bo body amen a body that I can dwell in throughout eternity that will not Decay or grow old amen what a Manion that is amen so our faith must rest in God's word that will not fail and then we can have a trust that will produce peace in the middle of your storm so we're in perilous times and it's getting worse we're in a time of trouble and it's getting worse but at that time if we finish that scripture in the time of trouble but at at that time his people shall be delivered everyone whose name is written on the book they shall be delivered how many's thankful for that word right there because we're in a time of trouble and it's getting worse and it's going to get worse but we should know Amen in this moment we can if we can trust that and we can see that being fulfilled then why won't the rest of it be fulfilled it will be fulfilled amen they shall be delivered you know we can read in judges chap 6 and verse 11 about Gideon and how you know he was hiding it was a time of trouble it was the midianites would come and steal their crops and they'd been in a big F you know they have nothing to live on because the midianites would come and and steal it all the time and and here he is hiding in a threshing floor and have you ever seen a threshing floor it's a place it's a low place and and and and so he was hiding in this place so he could he could try to thresh his wheat and where actually in the wine press and there he is he's doing all of this hiding from the minites and all of a sudden he sees somebody standing before him and he and he looks at this and he's wondering is he real or is he an angel and and and the Lord said and and the Lord began to speak to him an angel appeared and the Lord said go in the in thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of midianites have I not sent thee and he said him oh Lord wherewith shall I save Israel behold my family is poor in Manasses and I am the least in my father's house so he throwed up all of his excuses amen and the Lord said surely I will be with thee amen and thou shalt Smite the midianites as one man and now he's now looking okay Lord if this is really you you know he he had to have a fleece and so he goes gather some flesh and some unleavened cakes and and he brings them and presents them before him and the angel says put them there and he puts them in a place and the angel touched them with amen touched them with his with the fire of God and it burned it all up and then Gideon said perceive he was an angel and he's still standing there oh Lord God for because I've seen the angel face to face and the Lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not Thou shalt not die all right on on my God in the middle of struggles in the middle of trouble do you not know that's exactly what John 14 said amen don't let your heart be troubled you're not going to die but I'm going to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also amen and Gideon built an altar there in unto the Lord and called it Jehovah Shalom until this day amen why why because in the middle of his struggle in the middle of his trial in the middle of he could just trust God God would give him peace and he took this peace with him and when he didn't have a great Army when he didn't have many men and he didn't have great armymen he held the battle and he destroyed the midianites why because he trusted in his God Amen God has given you his peace he paid a terrible price so you could have his peace yes he the Bible says he the chastisement of our peace were upon him let's look at that Isaiah 53 and verse one who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and a root out of dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we would desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities that the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed what happened there on that day was a very peculiar thing to the onlookers it might appear that he was suffering on his own behalf come on come on because of his own sins yet we esteemed him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted however the opposite was true the butt that's there butt that begins verse five but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised but he was bruised for our iniquities amen what is it he was bruised the innocent one suffered for the guilty one amen the righteous one suffered for the unrighteous the transgression were ours the Mortal wounds belong to us but he was pierced instead Hallelujah ours were the iniquities and so was the crushing and the def figuring bruises but he took them upon himself the stripes that fell on his back should have rightly been yours should have rightly been mine but he let them be on his so you could be healed that's right in a word he took what belonged to us and gave us what belonged to him oh God maybe I got to read that one more time he took what belonged to you he took your iniquities he took your transgressions and he took it and gave you back what belongs to him his peace Hallelujah in other words the world's idea of Justice was turned upside down and it was done so that the world could be put upright amen God I just about had a fit reading this consider now how chastisement had become peace the Hebrew word for chastises M musar it may be Corporal or verbal it may it may be an instruction or a discipline or rebuke or a punishment a chastisement by words indicate that the purpose is to instruct but what Isaiah spoke speaks of a chastisement is a chastisement of wounds it's a chastisement of bruises and stripes and the purpose is for peace amen amen the Hebrew word for peace is shalom it's much more than the absence of conflict or or the ceasing of hostilities It's A Hess oh yeah it's what was once missing is now restored it's what was once broken is now healed he done all this so when you get sick you can be at peace that his word said you can be healed he done this so when you were founded guilty in sin you can have peace cuz he took it all and he gave you what was his hallu Jesus the son of God became flesh he had Had No Lack nothing was missing nothing was broken the lack was ours a bro we had broken relationship with God from the fall the creation was broken we had broken with each other broken with our ownselves amen the chastisement should have been on us but it let it it it let it he let it come upon him so we could have his peace his Shalom his Hess Hallelujah he took your Brokenness so he can you can have his wholeness Lord he took your discouragement so you can have his peace he took your fears and worries so you can have his faith he did all of this so you could be at peace that you would go through a trial and be at peace that's a paradox that you can go through sickness and be at peace that's right that you can go through a hardship of financial hardship and be at peace why can I be at peace in a hard a financial hardship because he said he's Jehovah Gyra he's more than enough he's our provider amen why can I be at peace when I when I'm in the middle of a heart sickness why can I have that peace cuz he's Jehovah rapi he's a Healer he's a deliverer he's a comforter he's all of that that we have need of brother Brandon would preach from this scripture in Isaiah 60 arise Shine for thy light has come yes and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee amen behold Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee so the the world is in darkness but upon the bride is light the glory of the Lord is shining upon thee his face is shining towards it he said this this is odd word to preach but Shalom it means peace it means God's peace God's peace he said it was a New Year's message he said he said it's not is it's it's to the church elected in Jesus Christ not just the church groups but the elect the lady the lady of the church Christ bride that's who I I'm addressing amen the two scriptures are are very contrast one to the other arise and shine for the glory is come upon you and the very next scripture is gross Darkness upon the people amen so we're we're a people living in with light upon us but living in darkness there's Darkness all around us so in the middle of Darkness I can have peace why because the light of God is the light unto my path we talk we preached on light sometimes ago and we talked about the the the light his word is a light unto our paths that's right and we spoke about it how that sometimes we don't the the light don't shine all the way to the end but it's enough light to see The Next Step you just walk as because it's a walk of faith if he shined a big old bright light all the way down to the end and said that's how it's going to be it wouldn't be f Faith No More but he wants you to walk by faith and not by sight so you're just taking one step at a time one moment at a time amen and you can do it while darkness is all around you and you may not be able to see three or four foot in front of you and it's so dark and gross darkness is upon the people and there's howling in darkness people chained in darkness and in the middle of it the Bride of Jesus Christ can be at peace why because the word has declared to be th Hallelujah arise and shine for the glory of God has come upon you the light is here grows Darkness upon the people so if you're walking by anything other than the light of God you're in darkness amen he said we're facing this year we're facing both Darkness and Light excuse me his old voice is Tred to hang bad for a while I'm tired of it the world is in one of the most chaotic times of Darkness it's ever stood in now this is 1964 somebody with some Mas skills tell me how many years that is that's 60 years 60 years past past this stage the world is one in one of the most chaotic times of Darkness that has ever stood in and it goes into the darkness that is dealing with and it was dealing with men trying to be women and women trying to be men and and how they're dressing and how they're acting he said you can't hardly find a manly man no more on I was in' 64 God have mercy where are we at today matter of fact a manly man has looked down upon and sneered at and made fun of amen and a manly woman is lifted up out of her position and out of her place yes that's the darkness that we're in amen we we can't you know we can't get to the place when a when a minister begins to correct something that we get all out of sorts and out of order and we get all tore up about it don't let the political spirits come into your spirit amen we got political spirits that are moving in this world I think it's very ironic that right here they're defunding the police what what what what what was the police Amen equated to in the message the Holy Spirit come on somebody and they come down and they want to defund the police and take the control away and put it in the Lawless people and allow them to do whatever they want to don't you know those same spirits will try to R right into the church and when the man of God begins to preach against something you say well I can't believe that's a bunch of old nonsense no sir it's the Holy Spirit crying out against it let's don't defund the Holy Spirit let's allow him to be powerful and moving Among Us and allow him to change our lives and to minister us so we're facing this year both Darkness and Light the world is in one of the most chaotic times of Darkness so it's just like it was at the beginning when there was gross Darkness upon the earth and the spirit of God began to move upon the face of the water and a voice spoke and said let there be light and God separated the light from darkness and he's doing it again today amen I believe that we're now living in the hour when God is separating light from Darkness he is pressing it to the the other side of the world and light that the light might be made manifest he said that's the church to the then the church the reason I say shalom to them is because that's God's peace that's what I want to bring to you amen not looking back but looking forward to the breaking of a new day there's something great laying just ahead of us we're 60 years down the road how much closer are we to something great just ahead of us amen yeah it's the greatest tra of trouble it's the days that are perilous and men are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God and they deny the power there all this we see it taking place but right in the middle of it there's a bride walking through Satan's e and she's at peace knowing God is in control that no matter what she goes through he's in control come on let me get on that just for a moment you might be in sickness but he's in control you might be in a trial but he's in control you might be don't know where your next feeli is coming from your next money to pay something but he is in control Hallelujah so it's shalom we see it breaking Over the Horizon he said there's something great laying the word the years has been the joy that we look forward to the pressing the coming of that great light talking about it the eternal and I want you to understand we're not trying to put just something out in front of us like a carrot but there is something out in front of us it's called a body change amen we see it breaking Over the Horizon we breaking between Mortal and immortality we see it breaking between heavens and earth from the Earthbound sickness and trouble world into the bright shining day of immortal life and the immortal body and Immortal Earth that'll never pass away it's shalom to the church it's lifetime coming for the Believers Hallelujah but gross Darkness for the people gross Darkness upon the people but now he and he like I said he went through a whole time of darkness and for the sake of time I'm not going to go through all that but he brought it he said now what he said I spend a lot of time on Darkness but what about the light he said there is a light so Rise and Shine for the light has come How can there be darkness in light has got to be separated and it's happening when the word is preached light and darkness is separated amen it's separated the only one only thing that separated is the word manifest it presses the darkness to the other side but when the manifested word of God the sun which is spoken into existence by the word shows itself Darkness runs to the other side that's what's taking place now darkness is separating itself from the light now to the elected Church in this dark hour he said now I say shalom God's peace peace peace every true Hebrew knew when he met when they meet one another they say shalom in other words good morning God be with you God's peace go with you it's good morning how do you do amen amen I'm going to say that to you tonight Shalom which is good morning how do you do why is it good morning it's the evening time because the word has brought the light and it's a light that is daing in on our hearts and our lives and it's pushing back the darkness so Shalom how do you do well brother Timothy I tell you what I've been so worried and all quit looking at the Darkness I've been so tore up about what I'm going through quit looking at the darkness maybe your vision with your eyes is all blurry and you can't see maybe we're almost where to take the next step quit looking and worrying about that just know when you step there'll be another word there for you to step on there'll never be another place that you can step and a light to illuminate it and allow you to move here and to move here and to move there why cuz God will not let his children be forsaken he's not going to allow it to come down into this time and where we're at and the Darkness is here and all the light to go out no when the light goes out that means we have left you're talking about Darkness this room looks bright because of all the lights started letting it go out one at a time yes that's what has happen happening right now actually why is getting darker cuz those our loved ones are going on over to the other side more lights moving over there but that light's not going to stay over there it's going to press back this way and it's going to push the darkness away until we can see them as they see W have that blurry vision no more we w't have those weird feelings no more we want to have all that eeky icky Darkness around us no more no we were was standing in complete light Shalom peace it's good morning to the church why you say that because Christ is appearing Among Us the Morning Light the Morning Star he's appearing among us when we see Darkness settling Darkness it gets darkest just before the day we know that the morning star is hanging Yonder to introduce the coming sun and when the morning shine star shines it's the goet it's always darkest just a few minutes before the day the black out comes and the moon fails to shine darkness before the day is because the light is pressing the darkness so don't think the darkness is getting great the light's getting stronger and it's pressing the darkness and The Morning Star comes out and says good morning Shalom oh God let me be a sounding voice for him this morning this evening good morning you're not going down into darkness you're going into the breaking of day that's him Among Us his word being identified Shalom the great day is beginning to break the morning breaks Eternal bright and fair when his Chosen One Shall Gather in the home beyond the skies when the road is Called Up Yonder I'll be there our names are on his book we will be there oh that's peace take that you rotten devil our name is on his book we will be there Shalom good morning peace be unto you the darkness is separating itself so we are to arise and shine for the light has come arise and shine the word the light has been Vindicated Among Us that's what this message is it is light yes it's not people want to walk away from it I don't I don't understand understand where you're walking to all I know is when they leave they get darker I've seen it too many times they can say they're free all they want to that ain't the kind of freedom I want and honestly I'm as free as I want to be I can I can smoke as much as I want to I can drink as much as I want to I can do all the sin I want to do but I just don't want to why because my life has been changed that's true Freedom amen you can take a pig out of the slop and you can PR him up all you want to and put pink Li red lipstick on his lip and you can put a bow on his head but you let that dude go one time where's he headed he's headed right back to the mud that wasn't true freedom but if you could ever change the nature of that pig he'll never want to go back to the mud again that's true Freedom amen this is what we have experienced by the message of the hour that brought the token back the fullness of the Holy Ghost it brought a nature change in the Liv to where they don't want to go out there no more so what about this year we're facing he says we could have more to say on this but from the darkness to the light introdu to the light new year new time brings me hope wow why does it bring you hope brother Timothy when it's getting worse because we're one step closer we're one day closer we're one minute closer we're only one day closer than we was yesterday we're one hour closer than when we started this service amen amen we we're moving minute by minute second by second amen you know he said New Year doesn't mean we're turning a new page oh no he said like the man one morning I heard it man got up early went out picked up the paper came back sat down picked put up his feet put the glasses on begin to read must have been over 40 his wife out getting breakfast said John anything new said no same old thing just new people that's right murders rapes everything somebody else done it but the same devil not turn a new page it's turn to the word amen it's not turn to turn to turn a new page and and you know I just need a a new start yeah we can get a new start but let's continue on Amen is turn to the word of God we ought to do this year is not going back but going forward he said oh Church turn to the word get back to the word flip the right switch Hallelujah he said they come by the old denominations going back to the old Creeds all the time and Dogman he said see they're just punching around on some light see artificial manmade but turn to the word and see the promises of the day amen it ain't changing the pages or changing the calendars or that doesn't change time he said a lot of people say well this old Year's gone throw away the old December calendar now and put up another one the new year that's what New Year mean to them to me I wanted to see what's promised for this day amen that's what's my heart's desire god what have you got in store for us this year what do you got in store for us this service what do you got in store for us am mean we see Darkness but we also see light and we know you haven't left us or forsaken us there because we it's written in your word and your word will not go fall to the ground but it will be fulfilled you said you'd be there until the end it ain't the end yet Lord so we're still here so we can be at peace looking to see what's next what's he going to do next what life is he going to change next what prodical is he going to bring home next what healing is he going to do next what salvation is he going to do next come on somebody what family is he going to restore next next amen what marriage is he going to put back together next Shalom peace don't be weary Jesus is here I remember reading this book when I was a kid read it over and over how to I I had this saying moon beam or something some character named Moon Moon something so never fear Moon Moon bird or moon beam is here that's what they their whole deal was don't fear he's here this character don't fear he's here how much more should we be looking at the word saying don't fear he's here don't worry about it he's got you he's bringing peace he brought peace to you his great light has come to us his word the great Mysteries have been revealed to us we see him today being manifested him manifesting himself doing the same things he did then so we don't have to worry we have to look up and shine with the joy of the Lord to know that I've been a privileged person that my eyes have come open to see this day and if he has allow my eyes to come open to where I can see the day that I'm living in and I can recognize him in his presence and then I can trust him for the future cuz I have seen him vindicate his word Time After Time After Time and he brought his word and he sent his word and he healed them so there will be a millennium the old will be young forever sickness will fade away death will will be no more we will build houses and that we will inhabit them we will plant Vineyards and eat the fruit thereof we'll not plant and another eat we're not build and another live in it but we'll build and live we'll plant and we'll eat nothing will be able to harm us we'll be changed from what we are now into the Glorious image of the Son of God years will never be able to touch you age can't do nothing to you you will be the immortal son or daughter of God what about the future he holds it how do I know when he's coming I don't know but he'll be there how do you know that brother Timothy cuz he said he would he said if it wasn't true I wouldn't tell you but he said it so it has to be true he's never let one other word fall to the ground so why would he start now well it's 2024 what difference did that make it was 120 years that Noah waited built an arc and hammered and then after he got it all finished he still had to wait God's time is not man's time we wanted a certain time a certain way certain place it's got to be this way and we get all in a tizzy and tore up about it if it don't happen the way we thought it should have You're Not Looking Through The Eyes of Christ you're looking with your eyes he knows the perfect times he knows the perfect way amen so we can have peace we can have peace in the middle of our storm listen he had it you know the PE kind of Peace he had there was a storm Rock in the boat what was he doing sleeping not us what's going to happen what's this thing's about to go down what we going to do Jesus peace he wasn't worried about the storms because the storms couldn't kill him why could they not kill him because it hadn't been prophesied to be so the word didn't say it would be that way the word said it'd be hung on a tree so he had enough confidence in his own word that he could sleep in the middle of a storm then why can't we have that same kind of confidence we go through things in life well I can't sleep at night well Psalms 4 and verse 8 said I will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thou Lord only maketh me dwell in safety hello it ain't your gun in the ne in the door next to you the little pull out door next to you that gives you safety that's your own your depending on your own abilities listen when some Intruder comes in chances are you're going to miss his hide anyway be the shakiest gun in the South all tore up and worried about your children and threaten and carrying on listen the gun is only a temporary safety matter of fact he might take you take it from me and shoot you with it but I tell you what I got a gun well so does so does he probably what you need is him only he maketh me dwell in safety Psalms 29 and verse 11 says the Lord will give strength unto his people the Lord will bless his people with peace what does that mean brother Timothy you mean I'm going to not have any storms to go through and I'm not going to have any trials that's the kind of PE no that's the kind of Peace humans want that ain't the kind of Peace God gives God gives peace in the middle of a storm Psalms 37 and verse1 says fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity for they shall soon be cut down like grass and wither as green herbs but trust in the Lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou sh shalt be fed Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thy heart commit thy ways in the Lord trust in him and he shall bring it to pass and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as a noon day rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prosper in his way because of the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass cease from anger forsake wrath Fred not thyself in any wise to do evil for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the Lord they shall inherit the earth for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yay th sh Thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall Delight thems in the abundance of Peace the wicked plot against against the just and nashes upon him with his teeth the Lord shall laugh at him for he sees that his day is coming Hallelujah the wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow and cast down the poor and the needy and to slay such to be of upright conversation their swords shall enter into their own heart and their bows shall be broken a little a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many Wicked oh come on somebody for the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the Lord upholdeth the righteous the Lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance shall be forever they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied but the wicked Shall Perish and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs and they shall consume under the smoke shall they be consumed way the wicked Barth and payeth not again but the righteous showeth mercy and giveth for such be as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they shall be cursed of him that cut it off the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand I have been young and now I'm old yet have not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed depart from Evil and do good and dwell forever more for the Lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his Saints they are preserved forever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein with it forever the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom and his tongue talketh of judgment the law of his God is in his heart none of his steps shall slide oh none of his steps shall slide none of his steps shall Slide the wicked watches the righteous and seeketh to slay him the Lord will not leave him in his hand nor condemn him when he's judged my God are we hearing what we're here talking about tonight the Lord will not leave you in that Wicked Hon's hand neither will he condemn you when you're judged cuz he already took your judgment wait on the Lord keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off Thou shalt see it I have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a great Bay tree yet he passed away and lo he was not yeah I sought him but he could not be found Mark the perfect man no that's not talking about you brother Mark maybe it is Mark the perfect man I just take that Mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man the end of that man is peace but the transgressors shall be destroyed together the end of the wicked shall be cut off but the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble and the Lord shall help him and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him so his end is going to be in peace why because he trust numbers 6 and verse 24 the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto Aaron and unto his son saying on this wise you shall bless the children of Israel how many spiritual Seed of Abraham amen so I'm going to bless you as a
