[39:47] uh
[39:48] john 11. we're going to look here
[39:51] very familiar scripture reading for all
[39:53] of us
[39:56] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[39:58] lord
[39:59] i tell you you work a long day on the
[40:01] job and
[40:02] you come here and you're just thankful
[40:04] for a church a body of believers that
[40:06] you can take a refuge in and knowing
[40:08] that we're all of like precious faith
[40:11] believing the same message
[40:13] believing the same god believing the
[40:15] same supernatural getting away from the
[40:17] cares of this life and so grateful and
[40:19] so honored to be a part of it tonight
[40:22] proud to be a part of even like
[40:23] tabernacle
[40:24] i'm proud to be a social associated with
[40:26] each and every one of you and we're just
[40:28] going to look to him tonight to be the
[40:30] speaker so we look here in john 11
[40:33] verse 1 it says now a certain man was
[40:35] sick named lazarus of bethany the town
[40:38] of mary and her sister martha and it was
[40:40] that mary which anointed the lord with
[40:42] ointment and wiped his feet with her
[40:44] hair whose brother lazarus was sick and
[40:46] i believe they sung about
[40:49] that mary tonight therefore his sister
[40:51] sent unto him saying lord behold he whom
[40:54] thou love us is sick
[40:56] when jesus heard that he said this
[40:58] sickness is not unto death
[41:00] but for the glory of god that the son of
[41:02] god might be glorified thereby
[41:04] now jesus loved martha and her sister
[41:07] and lazarus and when he had heard
[41:09] therefore that he was sick he had both
[41:11] two days still in the same place where
[41:13] he was then after that he said to his
[41:15] disciples let us go unto judea again now
[41:19] verse 11. if you skip down
[41:21] these things said he
[41:23] and after that he had said unto them our
[41:25] friend latharis sleepeth but i go that i
[41:28] may awake him out of sleep and his
[41:30] disciples are then said as disciples
[41:32] lord if he sleeps he shall do well
[41:35] howbeit jesus spake of his death but
[41:37] they thought that he had spoken of
[41:39] taking of a rest in sleep
[41:41] and then jesus said unto them plainly
[41:43] lazarus is dead and i'm glad for your
[41:45] sake that i was not there to the intent
[41:47] that you may believe nevertheless let us
[41:49] go unto him verse 20.
[41:53] then martha as soon as she heard that
[41:54] jesus was coming went and met him but
[41:57] mary sat still in the house
[41:59] then said martha unto jesus lord if thou
[42:01] had been here my brother had not had
[42:03] died but i know that even now whatsoever
[42:05] thou ask god god will give it jesus said
[42:07] unto her thy brother shall rise again
[42:09] martha said i know
[42:12] martha said unto him i know that he
[42:13] shall rise again in the resurrection
[42:15] it's the last day and jesus said unto
[42:16] her i am the resurrection and the life
[42:18] and he that believeth in me though he
[42:19] were dead yet shall he live and
[42:21] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[42:23] shall never die believeth out this she
[42:25] said unto him yay lord i believe that
[42:27] thou art christ the son of god which
[42:29] come into the world and when she had
[42:31] said so she went her way and called mary
[42:34] her sister secretly saying the master is
[42:37] come
[42:37] and he calleth thee you can have your
[42:39] seats this evening
[42:42] just want to take some time this evening
[42:43] just want to speak something very
[42:45] familiar to us but i want to pick back
[42:47] up on god does impossible math part 14
[42:49] and i i do trust that you're not getting
[42:51] tired of this series uh but i want to
[42:54] look here just for a little bit this
[42:55] evening on the master has come and
[42:58] calleth thee
[43:00] and we find that this is a very familiar
[43:02] scripture reading and brother branham
[43:04] would tell us that you know joseph had
[43:06] died and when joseph
[43:08] jesus's
[43:09] father had died that he went to live
[43:11] with martha and mary and lazarus and he
[43:13] became their pastor and he was good
[43:15] friends with them and really loved them
[43:17] and he said that they had left their
[43:18] church they left everything that they uh
[43:21] what they were used to and accustomed to
[43:22] and they left it all behind to follow
[43:24] him and to follow his teachings and in
[43:26] that day if you know anything about
[43:29] that that day to leave the orthodox
[43:31] church with meant penalty of death and
[43:33] they left all that risking their life so
[43:35] they can follow this one that they claim
[43:37] to be the messiah and yet we find that
[43:41] it's in their weakest moment it's in
[43:43] their darkest hours when their greatest
[43:45] need that they really need the lord the
[43:47] most and he's nowhere to be found
[43:50] we find in their their greatest despair
[43:53] when they meet him most they didn't see
[43:55] him they didn't hear him they didn't
[43:58] feel him and many times we find
[44:01] ourselves in the same place
[44:04] many times you find yourself in need of
[44:06] god and you don't hear god
[44:09] you're in need of a supernatural touch
[44:11] and he's nowhere to be found
[44:14] there's times when you need to see god
[44:16] and you need to see the manifestation
[44:18] and it feels like he didn't come to
[44:20] church tonight
[44:22] but it's at their lowest point and you
[44:24] would have thought that martha and mary
[44:27] would have lost confidence in jesus
[44:30] he would have thought that they had lost
[44:32] confidence in this one that they had
[44:34] risked everything for to follow in their
[44:36] darkest hour their lowest point their
[44:39] greatest trial their greatest need now
[44:42] they were left alone to mourn the loss
[44:45] of their brother and jesus was nowhere
[44:48] to be found
[44:52] they were left to answer all the critics
[44:55] well i thought you said he was a healer
[44:57] i thought you said he was the messiah i
[44:59] thought you said he could do this i
[45:01] thought you said he opened up the blind
[45:02] house i thought this and i thought that
[45:04] and they were left there to respond to
[45:07] the critics that didn't believe in the
[45:10] supernatural
[45:14] and i asked you what about our human
[45:16] nature
[45:17] some of you criticized the ministry
[45:19] because they're not present in your need
[45:23] oh we're going to get a little quiet
[45:24] we're not going to touch long on that
[45:28] but we fine you know the pastor doesn't
[45:30] call you when you're sick or the
[45:31] ministry doesn't reach out to you but if
[45:33] i recall correctly the bible tells us
[45:36] might you call the elders of the church
[45:38] and let them pray for you
[45:42] and then we find here notice now we find
[45:46] satan begins to work on what we would
[45:48] call a climb a complex in this arena and
[45:51] he'd go into your mind and start
[45:52] chattering into your mind thinking well
[45:54] the pastor doesn't care about you and
[45:56] this that and the other i mean we are
[45:57] the sheep he should call he should know
[45:58] what i'm going through i mean my
[46:00] goodness he's a pastor he don't have
[46:01] anything else in life to do but just go
[46:03] study the word and take care of my needs
[46:07] sometimes that's how we think
[46:10] and yet the devil's in the ear then the
[46:11] devil not only gets in the ear of that
[46:14] person that doesn't have a real
[46:15] experience or confidence real confidence
[46:18] in the ministry
[46:19] then they sit around the dinner table
[46:22] and then the chatter that was once in
[46:24] the mind in the ear of that person now
[46:27] becomes dissipated throughout the dinner
[46:29] table not only for the wife but also for
[46:31] the young children and then when your
[46:33] children get of age then you wonder why
[46:35] don't they serve god
[46:37] why don't they have any kind of love or
[46:39] any kind of desire for the things of god
[46:41] let me tell you why
[46:43] because you murdered the character
[46:46] you murdered the man's influence you
[46:48] destroyed his influence how can he help
[46:50] your kids when you've done this work
[46:55] but we found martha and married they
[46:56] didn't lose confidence in jesus though
[46:59] he left they saw for him and though they
[47:01] called after him and jesus tarried two
[47:04] days
[47:06] and didn't respond to their need
[47:09] notice his response was this sickness is
[47:11] not unto death but that the glory of god
[47:13] could be fulfilled
[47:15] see god has a purpose and god has a plan
[47:17] in everything that he does god does not
[47:20] make mistakes
[47:22] you may look at your trial you may look
[47:24] at your sickness you may look at the
[47:25] thing you're going through the situation
[47:27] that you're facing and you may look at
[47:29] it and you may think god deserted me
[47:31] when i needed him no god didn't god put
[47:33] you right there so that the glory of god
[47:36] could be made manifest
[47:38] that's what god is doing in that
[47:40] situation that's what god is doing in
[47:42] that trial that's what god is doing in
[47:44] that sick body god is bringing you to a
[47:46] place that god can show who he is in
[47:49] your
[47:50] life because when you're on the
[47:52] mountaintop you have no need of god
[47:55] so we think
[47:57] but it's in that valley as we spoke the
[47:58] last time it's in that valley
[48:00] that you really learn to trust god
[48:04] notice now jesus says this sickness is
[48:06] not unto death but for the glory of god
[48:08] that the son of god might be glorified
[48:11] thereby then we look down in john 11 15
[48:14] and he says and i am glad for your sakes
[48:16] that i was not there
[48:19] what a pastor
[48:21] i'm glad i didn't show up i'm glad you
[48:23] were in that hospital room by yourself
[48:26] no not quite like that but anyway
[48:28] i'm glad for your sex that i was not
[48:30] there to the intent that ye may believe
[48:35] notice his purpose
[48:38] his purpose is to get you to believe
[48:42] in your darkest hour to get you to
[48:44] believe in your weakest moment to
[48:47] elevate your faith to grab hold of a
[48:50] promise
[48:52] god had to let it get so dire so dead so
[48:56] stinky so miserable that he can manifest
[49:00] himself
[49:01] because he is god
[49:05] jesus delayed his coming because he knew
[49:07] what the father had already showed him
[49:11] see he already had a vision of what was
[49:12] going to transpire
[49:14] therefore he could say this sickness is
[49:16] not unto death but for the glory of god
[49:20] and let me just say god knows about your
[49:22] situation
[49:24] god knows about your sickness
[49:26] god knows about that doctor's report
[49:27] that you received this week god knows
[49:30] but he says it's not unto death
[49:32] but for the glory of god
[49:34] you got to look at the promise and quit
[49:36] looking at the situation
[49:38] quit take your eyes oh look i understand
[49:40] maybe you did get a report that says you
[49:41] got this and you got that and that's
[49:43] part of it take your eyes off the report
[49:45] and put your eyes on his report his
[49:47] report says you're already healed by my
[49:49] stripes
[49:52] so we fail to see jesus has allowed
[49:54] these things or god had allowed these
[49:56] things
[49:57] to come to pass
[49:58] in in lazarus life so that he can
[50:01] display his supreme deity
[50:04] he wanted to open up the eyes of martha
[50:06] that she would never have another doubt
[50:08] in her mind who he was she want he
[50:10] wanted to show himself so allowed to
[50:12] marry more than just washing his feet
[50:14] but he was going to be a living
[50:16] manifested god in their time of need
[50:19] there would never be another doubt
[50:21] across their mind because they seen the
[50:23] effects of the supernatural god in their
[50:25] midst
[50:26] and not only for them but for the
[50:28] disciples that they would believe
[50:31] that they will never come in your mind a
[50:33] frequent of doubt or unbelief or
[50:36] anything no matter what you're going
[50:37] through we believe who he is because we
[50:39] see who he is
[50:43] let me ask you
[50:45] these things that this situation with
[50:47] lazarus wasn't just for lazarus
[50:51] this man's
[50:53] no doubt he's in a new body
[50:56] he's enjoying his new life
[51:00] he ain't worried
[51:02] he's 18.
[51:04] walking on streets of gold maybe
[51:05] something i don't know
[51:07] but it wasn't so much for him
[51:11] that it got that dire
[51:13] but it was for his sisters
[51:15] it was for all the believers there that
[51:17] was mourning the loss of lathers it was
[51:19] for the disciples god had a purpose
[51:24] and notice
[51:25] why did god allow cancer to strike
[51:27] sister atlanta
[51:29] why did god allow alopecia to strike
[51:32] mariah
[51:33] why did god allow drew to be born
[51:36] crippled or whatever it was where he
[51:37] couldn't walk for many many many years
[51:39] why did god allow those things it wasn't
[51:41] for sister atlanta it wasn't for sister
[51:43] mariah it wasn't for brother drew no it
[51:45] was so that god can declare himself a
[51:48] living god in this age in a godless age
[51:51] god was showing he's going to have
[51:53] somebody that's going to believe the
[51:55] works of god that he's going to manifest
[51:57] himself that it would encourage you in
[51:59] your community when you're at your
[52:01] darkest tower when you're at your
[52:03] weakest moment he's still god
[52:06] he's still god why did he do it so that
[52:09] you can't believe
[52:12] oh to relevate your faith tonight to
[52:14] believe no matter what you're facing no
[52:16] matter what you're going through no
[52:18] matter how hard the trial is just to get
[52:20] you to believe that he's still god
[52:22] he's god and laodicea
[52:25] and he's god in your trial he's god in
[52:27] your sickness he's god and your need and
[52:29] he's god here tonight and when god comes
[52:32] he calls
[52:33] the master has come and he's calling you
[52:37] he's calling your faith up another notch
[52:39] to get you to believe
[52:41] to get you to believe
[52:45] so he had a purpose
[52:47] that strengthens our faith
[52:49] to prove that he's mindful of our needs
[52:51] to prove that he's a living god to
[52:53] reassure us that he's on the throne
[52:57] and that he's in control
[52:59] four days late no he's in control
[53:03] but four days late don't worry about
[53:04] four days like he's in control
[53:08] see he wants you to believe his word no
[53:10] matter what you're facing
[53:12] now i know that's easier said and done
[53:14] right
[53:17] it's easier said and done but notice
[53:20] they sent for him
[53:22] 11 3 therefore his sisters sent unto him
[53:25] saying lord behold
[53:27] he whom thou love us is sick
[53:30] now jesus loved martha
[53:32] and her sister in lazarus but when he
[53:35] had heard therefore that he was sick
[53:37] he'll bow two days still
[53:40] in the same place
[53:42] oh my
[53:45] that's a great pastor
[53:47] goes off on a vacation leaves you high
[53:49] and dry
[53:50] you call for them hey you rung them up
[53:52] on the phone you sent messages to them
[53:55] and he refused to come to your aid
[53:58] what a great pastor no don't look back
[54:00] here bro tim when he talking about him
[54:03] talking about jesus
[54:07] in their greatest hour of need
[54:10] they sent for him
[54:13] and instead of coming he went further
[54:18] instead of coming he takes the vacation
[54:21] another city
[54:22] away oh i'm not going to shred porn no
[54:25] sir i'm going here
[54:28] then you send form there and he goes a
[54:29] little bit further
[54:31] then he goes a little bit further what
[54:33] is he doing he knows the vision
[54:36] he already knows what's going to happen
[54:39] i love how brother branham will say this
[54:41] he said verily very i say you uh i say
[54:43] unto you the son can do nothing in
[54:45] himself but what he sees the father
[54:48] doing see the father had already told
[54:50] him to go away and to be away for so
[54:52] many days and after the days was
[54:55] accomplished then he said our friend
[54:57] lather is sleeping
[55:00] so you think god was caught by surprise
[55:02] that he didn't know what was going to
[55:03] happen in lazarus situation
[55:05] nor is he caught by surprise with your
[55:07] situation
[55:09] god knows before that doctor puts his
[55:12] name on that report what your situation
[55:15] is
[55:16] but more importantly god knows the end
[55:18] he has the final say he is the final say
[55:23] notice now he said he is dead and for
[55:25] your sakes i'm glad i wasn't there
[55:27] because then they'd be trying to get him
[55:29] to go and heal him notice
[55:31] you know we want that we want healing we
[55:32] want deliverance but see lazarus had to
[55:34] operate or not last but jesus had to
[55:36] operate according to the vision
[55:39] so god has a purpose in allowing these
[55:41] things to happen and he has a purpose
[55:43] for allowing the things that happen in
[55:44] our life some of you get sick some of
[55:46] you get cancer some of you have
[55:48] disappointment some of you face sorrows
[55:50] some of you lose a close friend or maybe
[55:52] we lost a companion but nothing that we
[55:54] face in this life is by chance god
[55:57] doesn't make mistakes
[56:01] see no situation that we will ever
[56:03] encounter has ever taken god by surprise
[56:07] see he knows the final verdict he knows
[56:10] what the ultimate say is going to be and
[56:12] he knows what the end of your story is
[56:15] i was telling brother timothy in the
[56:16] back i wish we knew the end
[56:19] i wish we knew the end
[56:21] but if we knew the end it wouldn't be by
[56:22] faith
[56:24] but this is a faith walk
[56:26] and we're challenged to believe
[56:29] when you don't have the strength you're
[56:30] challenged to believe when you don't
[56:32] feel like it you're challenged to
[56:33] believe when you feel like giving up
[56:35] he's asking you to believe
[56:37] all things are impossible to them are
[56:40] possible to them that will believe
[56:43] nothing impossible
[56:45] brother brethren would tell us now in
[56:46] the message then jesus came and called
[56:48] he said all hopes was gone lathers had
[56:50] died every hour they kept thinking he
[56:52] might come on the scene but he might
[56:54] come on the scene and he'd come back or
[56:56] and he might come back but finally he
[56:58] died and the breath left them notice
[57:01] they went they embalmed his body take
[57:02] the blood out of his body wrapped them
[57:04] in linen spices and bonded and laid them
[57:06] in the grave put a rock over the grave
[57:07] which was their custom of bearing in
[57:09] those days a hole was cut in the ground
[57:11] a rock put over the top of it and there
[57:13] he was
[57:16] none of you were in that dire condition
[57:18] tonight
[57:19] but we find here all hopes was gone
[57:24] now it's too late
[57:27] lathers has taken his last breath and
[57:29] where is jesus
[57:33] the life has now left his body and there
[57:36] was no jesus
[57:38] they drained the blood from his body and
[57:40] still know jesus
[57:42] they poked him with embalming fluid and
[57:45] still no jesus they wrapped him in linen
[57:48] and they put spices on them and still
[57:50] jesus was not there they threw his body
[57:53] in a borrowed tomb and still jesus was
[57:56] not there in their darkest hour and
[57:58] their weakest moment jesus was not there
[58:01] but i want you to know brother says
[58:03] jesus was on his road back because he
[58:05] knew the end of the
[58:07] story he knew what was about to
[58:08] transpire
[58:11] he said the first day passed second day
[58:13] passed no jesus third day passed no
[58:15] jesus but the fourth day passed and the
[58:17] man was already rotten in the grave all
[58:20] hoax was gone and it may appear in your
[58:22] situation that there's no hope there's
[58:24] no way it's useless i gotta give up i
[58:27] gotta throw in the towel let me tell you
[58:29] you're not in lazarus condition tonight
[58:31] it may be that you're four days dead and
[58:33] your body begins to rise but he's still
[58:35] jesus and he's still a longtime god
[58:38] [Applause]
[58:40] all hopes of seeing him was gone but
[58:43] they had waited maybe he'll come
[58:45] maybe he'll come tonight in this service
[58:51] oh i love i love now
[58:53] how the bible would tell us in 11 20
[58:56] then martha as soon as she heard jesus

[59:11] when jesus comes it brings new hope
[59:14] it brings new desires it brings new
[59:16] ambitions and when
[59:18] martha heard that he was coming

[1:07:09] he won't turn me down
[1:07:11] not psychology

[1:07:14] but the dynamics
[1:07:16] the dynamics
[1:07:18] of the holy ghost
[1:07:20] and when you preach the dynamics of the
[1:07:22] holy the cripples will walk

[1:07:41] nothing
[1:07:42] is impossible with god and nothing is
[1:07:45] impossible with you that'll take god at
[1:07:47] his word tonight
[1:07:49] see it brought new hopes
[1:07:51] he brought new hopes
[1:07:53] notice
[1:07:55] verse 20. now martha as soon as she
[1:07:58] heard that jesus was coming she went and
[1:08:00] she met him
[1:08:02] but mary sat still in the house
[1:08:04] but see it brought new hopes to her she
[1:08:06] heard oh it may look like it all hopes
[1:08:08] was gone but she heard jesus was coming
[1:08:11] see brother brown would say she seemed
[1:08:12] to manifest the word of god she seen
[1:08:14] that age if she wouldn't have she would
[1:08:16] have still been an orthodox she would
[1:08:18] have still belonged to the church but
[1:08:19] she had seen the promised word she had
[1:08:22] seen the promised word manifested by him
[1:08:24] and she knew that he was the living word
[1:08:28] and he's a living word in this hour
[1:08:31] he's the living word she's seen the
[1:08:33] blinded eyes open
[1:08:34] she's seen the walk
[1:08:36] she's seemed to the spots on the leopard
[1:08:39] vanish
[1:08:40] and be made clean
[1:08:42] see there was no denying that she had
[1:08:44] witnessed
[1:08:45] the living manifestation of the word of
[1:08:48] god
[1:08:49] and there's no denying that we have
[1:08:51] witnessed the same at this church
[1:08:53] in this hour in this age in the darkest
[1:08:56] of all times
[1:08:58] the light has all but almost gone out
[1:09:00] but yet she believed
[1:09:03] notice maybe she heard the story
[1:09:05] how god was in elijah
[1:09:07] and there was a shooter white woman who
[1:09:08] believed and she had a little boy and he
[1:09:10] had died and she called for her life
[1:09:12] said i'm not going to leave i'm not
[1:09:13] going to leave until you come to my son
[1:09:15] and elijah came and laid his body on the
[1:09:16] boy and life came back to him and she
[1:09:18] knew that if god was in elijah surely
[1:09:21] god is in christ
[1:09:23] and if he can do that in a prophet what
[1:09:24] can he do with the living manifest
[1:09:26] manifested word
[1:09:28] church he's here tonight
[1:09:31] he's here for your need tonight no
[1:09:33] matter how bad the situation or how many
[1:09:35] how many days the brother's been laid in
[1:09:37] the grave she knew that god was in
[1:09:39] elijah she knew that god was in christ
[1:09:41] she knew these times will follow them
[1:09:42] that believe and i'm asking you do you
[1:09:44] believe tonight do you give witness
[1:09:46] tonight how do you get witness by your
[1:09:48] voice by your amen by your response back
[1:09:50] to the word she believed and look the
[1:09:53] impossibilities were made real because
[1:09:55] she took god at his word
[1:10:00] and brother said he's the same yesterday
[1:10:02] today and forever
[1:10:05] and he has not changed he's as very much
[1:10:07] god for your need tonight as he was for
[1:10:10] blind bartimaeus as he was for the woman
[1:10:12] at the well as he was from arthur as he
[1:10:14] was for the shudomite woman he's still
[1:10:16] god
[1:10:18] he's still god
[1:10:20] notice here in verse 21 then said martha
[1:10:22] unto jesus

[1:15:58] the scene to minister to your needs
[1:16:01] we can study we can pray and the god can
[1:16:03] lead us this way in that way but i'm
[1:16:05] praying god may there be a spirit of the
[1:16:06] sermon that'll reach into that heart it
[1:16:08] may be dark it may be bleak if they may
[1:16:10] feel like giving up they may be so bound
[1:16:12] by depression and anxieties and fears
[1:16:15] and suicide whatever it may be
[1:16:16] pornography may be ravishing their life
[1:16:18] but even now lord lord if you can just
[1:16:21] anoint these lips tonight if you can
[1:16:23] just move the heart of your servant to
[1:16:25] go to that need minister to that life

[1:16:29] key into that like lord and unlock the
[1:16:31] promises of god to him even now lord do
[1:16:34] it tonight father may there be such a

[1:22:54] you in the vision he knows what's about
[1:22:56] to happen church

[1:23:47] he was about to manifest the vision
[1:23:51] he was about to bring
[1:23:53] the total climax
[1:23:56] see he had a purpose god had a purpose
[1:24:00] he waited four days
[1:24:03] where have you laid them
[1:24:05] see there was a jewish superstition that
[1:24:08] said that the body or the soul would
[1:24:10] hang around the grave
[1:24:11] for three days
[1:24:14] so he had to wait till the fourth day
[1:24:18] so there was no possibility of
[1:24:20] resurrection or resuscitation
[1:24:23] because he knew who he was
[1:24:26] and it may appear tonight
[1:24:29] that you're four days late
[1:24:32] oh but even now lord
[1:24:34] notice what he tells martha
[1:24:36] in john 11 39
[1:24:38] jesus said take he away the stone
[1:24:43] see we got something to do church
[1:24:45] we got a part to play on a wednesday
[1:24:47] night
[1:24:48] oh y'all want the ministry to do all the
[1:24:49] work don't you
[1:24:51] that one of us come up here and study
[1:24:52] for all well we came here and we halfway
[1:24:54] studied
[1:24:56] you wouldn't get nothing out of this
[1:24:57] service
[1:24:58] no we studied all week weeks hours and
[1:25:01] it'll tell how many hours we put into a
[1:25:02] service
[1:25:04] and you expect us to do all the work
[1:25:06] jesus said no
[1:25:08] you take me where he's at but i want you
[1:25:10] to roll the stone away you got a part to
[1:25:12] play in a wednesday night service on a
[1:25:14] sunday night service on a friday youth
[1:25:16] service on a saturday banquet service we
[1:25:18] got a part to play even like tabernacle
[1:25:20] it ain't all for the ministry we got a
[1:25:22] part to play in this we got to roll the
[1:25:24] stone away we got to push away the
[1:25:25] doubts we got to push away the fears we
[1:25:27] got to push away the anxiety we got to
[1:25:29] grab hold of every promise of god and
[1:25:31] say yeah it ain't mean it's for me
[1:25:33] tonight it's for my family it's for my
[1:25:35] loved one it's for my children it's for
[1:25:37] the family of god it's more even like
[1:25:39] tabernacle yes lord i believe it tonight
[1:25:42] and if you can believe tonight church
[1:25:45] if you can believe tonight
[1:25:48] that he's god he's as very much god
[1:25:50] tonight as he was for martha and mary
[1:25:53] you're going to see the supernatural
[1:25:56] you're going to see a display so see god
[1:25:59] had a purpose
[1:26:00] he let it get four days late
[1:26:03] so that he can prove his deity
[1:26:05] so that he can prove that he's not a
[1:26:07] superstition
[1:26:10] so that he can prove no matter what
[1:26:12] stage four cancer says
[1:26:14] no matter what this doctor says no
[1:26:16] matter what the family dynamics say he
[1:26:19] has the final say
[1:26:23] notice
[1:26:24] martha and mary they took away the stone
[1:26:26] from the place where they laid him and
[1:26:27] jesus lifted up his eyes and he said
[1:26:28] father i thank thee that thou has heard
[1:26:30] me and i knew that thou hearst me always
[1:26:33] but because of the people we stand by i
[1:26:35] said it that they may believe that thou
[1:26:38] hast sent me he had a purpose to elevate
[1:26:41] their faith to believe
[1:26:44] no matter who's preaching to elevate
[1:26:46] your faith to believe and when he had
[1:26:48] thus spoken he cried with a loud voice
[1:26:51] lazarus come forth and he that was dead
[1:26:54] came forth bound hand and foot with
[1:26:56] grave clothes and his face was bound
[1:26:59] with the napkin and jesus said unto them
[1:27:02] loose him and let him go
[1:27:05] he's the same
[1:27:07] god tonight
[1:27:09] and the prophet of god would say that
[1:27:10] martha was at the right place in the
[1:27:13] front of the right man with the right
[1:27:15] attitude and with the right approach she
[1:27:18] didn't come in on a wednesday night and
[1:27:19] sit down on the preacher
[1:27:22] she didn't come in with a complex her
[1:27:24] tongue all bent out of shape
[1:27:27] scold him because you didn't do this and
[1:27:29] you didn't do that even now lord
[1:27:32] he said notice now
[1:27:35] he said she was at the right place with
[1:27:37] the right attitude he says that can be
[1:27:39] done if we'll take the right attitude
[1:27:41] towards him if we'll come to see him to
[1:27:44] love him and to worship him then god is
[1:27:46] obligated to give us them things which
[1:27:48] we desire he said the right attitude or
[1:27:51] the right the right mind or mindset to
[1:27:53] any divine promise of god will bring it
[1:27:56] to pass
[1:27:58] so your tragedy
[1:28:01] is all you see how many is in a
[1:28:02] difficult spot tonight
[1:28:05] nobody okay we got a bunch of cherubs
[1:28:06] here praise god
[1:28:09] your tomb is only a miracle in the
[1:28:12] waiting
[1:28:14] your trial is only an opportunity for
[1:28:17] god to display his dynamics
[1:28:20] your situation may be dead but god says
[1:28:23] i'm the i am
[1:28:25] i heard a brother say last week your
[1:28:27] miracle is in the room
[1:28:30] your miracle is in the room
[1:28:33] your miracle's not brother joe it's not
[1:28:34] brother timothy brother tim brother
[1:28:35] there your miracle is in a room though
[1:28:38] it's here he's just waiting on you to
[1:28:40] appropriate the faith to believe it
[1:28:43] he's waiting on for you to say i'm going
[1:28:44] to push that stone away of unbelief
[1:28:46] tonight and i'm going to believe god
[1:28:50] notice now all this took place
[1:28:53] so that the glory of god could be made
[1:28:56] manifest
[1:28:57] notice what he did to moses told moses
[1:28:59] moses you're going to take my people out
[1:29:01] you're going to take them out of egypt
[1:29:02] you're going to cross over here you're
[1:29:03] going to take them to this mountain
[1:29:04] you're going to worship me over there
[1:29:06] and moses did exactly what god said he
[1:29:08] went to pharaoh showed out who he was
[1:29:10] said moses you let my people go got his
[1:29:12] people out of there and they get down
[1:29:13] and then they find the self mountains on
[1:29:15] both sides a great big sea in front of
[1:29:17] them and pharaoh's army coming behind
[1:29:19] them they were in a dark place but god
[1:29:21] had already told moses moses you're
[1:29:23] going to worship me in that mountain let
[1:29:25] me tell you there's not enough pharaohs
[1:29:26] there's not enough devils in hell we've
[1:29:28] already been seen in a vision god has
[1:29:30] already sold it there's going to be a
[1:29:32] rapture i'm going to have a bride she's
[1:29:34] going to be without spot she's going to
[1:29:35] be without regal i ain't enough devils
[1:29:37] and help to stop god's purpose or god's
[1:29:39] plan you've already been seen there
[1:29:41] church you've already been witness on
[1:29:43] the other side i don't shout right now
[1:29:45] thank you god it may be dark
[1:29:48] let me just say this if the red sea
[1:29:50] would have never opened god would have
[1:29:51] washed him right off top of the water
[1:29:54] because he's god tonight
[1:29:59] moses told him stand still you're about
[1:30:01] to see the witness of the holy ghost
[1:30:02] you're about to see god move and those
[1:30:05] enemies that you face today you're gonna
[1:30:07] face him no more
[1:30:09] see he knew who he was
[1:30:12] he knew that he had been called
[1:30:14] he knew that god gave him a promise and
[1:30:16] god gave him a commission and god has
[1:30:18] given you that same promise and that
[1:30:20] same commission
[1:30:22] see god likes to he likes to let it get
[1:30:24] to the darkest hour
[1:30:27] but he says it's the darkest hours when
[1:30:29] jesus
[1:30:30] comes on the
[1:30:32] scene in your darkest hour let me just
[1:30:35] skip down so
[1:30:38] in your darkest hour
[1:30:40] that's when jesus appears
[1:30:42] and see the way we get things from god
[1:30:45] is the way that we approach it so you
[1:30:47] have to approach it the right way
[1:30:50] god i believe
[1:30:51] he said maybe it's the darkest hour
[1:30:53] you've ever seen or you've ever seen or
[1:30:56] you or you he says but maybe the
[1:30:58] doctor's given you up but jesus comes
[1:31:00] along just in the darkest hour
[1:31:05] he comes in just in the darkest hour
[1:31:06] hebrew children in the darkest hour
[1:31:10] that last step off that platform was the
[1:31:12] first step into his presence
[1:31:15] and he was there
[1:31:17] he wasn't a minute early and he wasn't a
[1:31:19] second late he was on time
[1:31:21] and he's that same god for you tonight
[1:31:24] in their darkest hour the furnace heated
[1:31:27] up seven times hotter than it ever been
[1:31:28] hit before but yet jesus met them there
[1:31:31] blind bartimaeus we know the story of
[1:31:33] blind bartimaeus the man that sowed this
[1:31:35] that and the other to try to make a
[1:31:37] living for his family and he here he was
[1:31:39] they put him out on a street corner and
[1:31:40] jesus comes passing by thousands of
[1:31:42] people hundreds of people screaming
[1:31:44] hosanna to the hives and he hears what's
[1:31:46] going on he says oh that's jesus another
[1:31:48] he's compassion by the way and blind
[1:31:50] bartimaeus in his mind oh they set me at
[1:31:52] the wrong place but he began to cry oh
[1:31:54] jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
[1:31:58] he said there was hundreds of people all
[1:31:59] around crying out and he said there's no
[1:32:01] way that he could have hurt but
[1:32:02] something stopped him and when it
[1:32:04] stopped jesus jesus called bartimaeus to
[1:32:07] his side let me tell you the master's
[1:32:08] come for you tonight and he's come to
[1:32:10] call you he's come to call you out of
[1:32:12] blindness he's come to call you out of
[1:32:14] sickness he's come to call you to
[1:32:15] himself
[1:32:17] the master has come
[1:32:20] and he's calling you
[1:32:21] think about the woman with the blood
[1:32:23] issue
[1:32:24] so to all her living well the man said
[1:32:26] she hocked the farm and gave the the
[1:32:29] team away and everything spent all her
[1:32:31] money trying to trying to just get to
[1:32:33] where she can be healed
[1:32:35] she was sitting there and she looked
[1:32:36] down and she seen
[1:32:38] the multitudes around him
[1:32:40] so if i can just get if i can just touch
[1:32:42] the hem of his garment
[1:32:45] if i can just muster enough faith just
[1:32:47] to get down and fight my way through the
[1:32:49] crowd fight my way through through all
[1:32:51] those that may say something oh you
[1:32:52] little holy roller you act this way and
[1:32:54] you act that way if i can just fight my
[1:32:56] way to him and touch to him
[1:32:58] of his garment and when she touched him
[1:33:01] he turned around and he called
[1:33:03] i perceive virtue has left me
[1:33:06] he's the same god tonight
[1:33:09] a woman at the world the woman at the
[1:33:11] well
[1:33:12] right in her darkest hour
[1:33:14] immoral
[1:33:15] jesus had a need to go by samaria
[1:33:19] of all places the racial tension between
[1:33:22] jews and samaritans and yet he had a
[1:33:25] need
[1:33:26] to go by there
[1:33:28] he had a need brother elle to go to
[1:33:30] mississippi
