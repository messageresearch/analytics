[0:01] [Music]
[0:13] in the morning when I
[0:17] Rise I lift my head and turn my eyes to
[0:22] the
[0:23] window where the light is shining
[0:27] through
[0:28] [Music]
[0:31] when my feet hit the
[0:34] ground I know a place where love is
[0:39] found so I
[0:40] go where I know I'll find the
[0:46] truth I turn to
[0:50] Jesus I turn to the one who knows my
[0:55] name I know he walks with me and he
[0:59] talks with me and he tells me I am
[1:04] save and
[1:07] honestly I could give a million
[1:11] different
[1:13] reasons for
[1:17] why I
[1:20] turn I turn to
[1:25] Jesus when the night starts to fall
[1:31] and I'm worried I won't sleep at all and
[1:35] my heart is afraid of what's
[1:42] ahead there's a voice through the
[1:47] chaos that comforts me and gives me rest
[1:52] when I'm
[1:53] weary and I'm longing for a
[1:58] friend I turn to
[2:02] Jesus I turn to the one who knows my
[2:06] name I know he walks with me and he
[2:11] talks with me and he tells me I am
[2:16] save and
[2:18] honestly I could give a million
[2:22] different
[2:24] reasons for
[2:28] why I turn
[2:32] I turn to
[2:35] [Music]
[2:37] Jesus
[2:39] Turn Your Eyes Upon
[2:45] Jesus look
[2:47] full in his
[2:50] wonderful
[2:52] face and the
[2:56] things of this world will grow
[3:00] strangely
[3:02] dim in the
[3:04] light of his
[3:07] glory and
[3:10] grace I turn to
[3:14] Jesus I turn to the one who knows my
[3:18] name I know he walks with me and he
[3:23] talks with me and he tells me I am
[3:28] safe and all
[3:30] honestly I could give a million
[3:34] different
[3:36] reasons for
[3:40] why I
[3:43] turn I turn to Jesus
[3:54] [Applause]
