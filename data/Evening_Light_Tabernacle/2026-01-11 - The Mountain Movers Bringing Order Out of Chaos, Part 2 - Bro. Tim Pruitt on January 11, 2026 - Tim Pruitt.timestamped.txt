[13:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He has a great name. is a
[13:32] name that is greater than any name.
[13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm thankful to be able to call
[13:36] upon that name today and
[13:38] &gt;&gt; bring knees before him that knowing that
[13:41] whatever I name, whatever sickness, his
[13:43] name is greater.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; Whatever problem, his name is greater.
[13:47] Whatever situation, his name is greater.
[13:50] Amen.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're glad to have brother Buster,
[13:53] Sister Libby Wiggins back with us today.
[13:56] Amen. Brother Buster called and just
[13:58] wanted to me to give thanks for all that
[14:00] prayed for him while he was having
[14:01] surgery with the blood clots and then
[14:04] they faced the flu afterwards. Just
[14:06] really thank the Lord for your prayers.
[14:08] And it's a comfort when you're in a
[14:10] situation like that to know you got real
[14:12] Christians praying for you. Somebody
[14:14] that can touch the heart of God for you.
[14:16] And so, Amen. And I I believe when
[14:19] people write prayer requests in, they're
[14:21] not doing it as a formality, but they're
[14:23] doing it because they believe that the
[14:25] Lord's going to hear the prayers of the
[14:27] righteous and and answer them. Amen.
[14:30] Brother Glenn Tomlinson is asking for
[14:32] prayer for his upcoming chemo treatment
[14:35] this Wednesday. So, he's been allergic
[14:37] to having allergic reactions, various
[14:40] things, uh various uh previous chemos.
[14:44] So going try a new one this week and
[14:46] just asking the Lord to uh undertake for
[14:49] him. Uh brother Peter Gayley's sister
[14:53] Julie had a stroke a couple of weeks
[14:54] ago. She's facing surgery to unclog an
[14:58] artery this week. Ask the Lord to be
[15:00] merciful on her behalf. The Burrow
[15:03] family wrote in. They're still sick.
[15:05] Needs need touch in their lives and
[15:08] their bodies. Also, we want to remember
[15:11] brother Alvin Adams this morning. His
[15:13] legs are really swollen. Can't hardly
[15:15] walk. Also, we have brother Aaron that's
[15:18] ministering there in Canada. And brother
[15:21] Joe is also away ministering. How many
[15:23] would have a need today? You just want
[15:25] to make it known to the Lord. I'm ask
[15:26] brother Sam Patton if he'd come and open
[15:29] our service in prayer and take these
[15:31] needs before the Lord. Let's just pray
[15:33] together. Amen. That the Lord hears our
[15:36] prayers and answers these needs.
[15:39] Amen.
[15:41] His name is great
[15:43] &gt;&gt; and greatly to be praised. You know,
[15:45] Wednesday, I didn't think I was going to
[15:47] be here. AT&T had shipped me to Monroe
[15:51] for the week. Well, Wednesday, my
[15:54] machine happened to break down. I had to
[15:56] come back to Shreport to get another
[15:58] machine Wednesday. So, God made a way.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; I didn't think there was a way, but God
[16:04] made a way.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's just go before him
[16:07] this morning.
[16:10] Oh God, your name is great and greatly
[16:13] to be praised, Lord.
[16:16] Lord, you're mighty. You've done so much
[16:20] for us, Lord.
[16:22] Lord, we can we can get irritated. We
[16:25] can get down, Lord. But if we would just
[16:28] look up, you've done so much for us.
[16:33] Oh God, we thank you for touching
[16:36] Brother Buster, Lord, and all he's all
[16:38] they've been through. Lord, we pray that
[16:40] you'll just continue
[16:43] continue to touch his body, Lord. Give
[16:45] him a complete recovery, Lord. Lord,
[16:48] this one face in chemo again, Lord.
[16:52] Lord, it's poison in our bodies, Lord,
[16:54] but we pray that you'll just use it,
[16:56] Lord. Use it for your glory.
[17:01] All things are possible through you,
[17:03] Lord. God, we pray that you'll just take
[17:05] a hold of this service, Lord. Anoint
[17:08] each one for your glory, Lord. Help each
[17:11] one of us to get ourselves out of the
[17:13] way, Lord, that you might come and use
[17:16] each one of us, Lord. The musicians,
[17:18] Lord, Brother Timothy as he leads us in
[17:21] song, Brother Tim as he comes and
[17:24] ministers the word to us. Lord, help
[17:27] each one of us to get out of the way.
[17:28] Lord, just open up our hearts to you,
[17:31] Lord. Lord, as brother Tim said, you
[17:34] know, it's the worship that he desires,
[17:37] Lord. It's the worship you desire for
[17:39] each one of us, Lord. Help us to open
[17:43] ourselves up to what you would have, the
[17:46] worship you would have, Lord. Oh God, we
[17:49] just pray that you'll just touch lives
[17:51] in this service, Lord. Comfort the those
[17:54] who need comforted, Lord. Heal those who
[17:56] need healed, Lord. Save the lost, Lord,
[17:59] among us. Bring those back that need
[18:02] you, Lord. Oh, we thank you, Lord Jesus.
[18:06] We ask your blessings upon this service
[18:09] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[18:11] Christ. That name that is above every
[18:13] name for your glory.
[18:17] We ask it in Jesus name. Amen.
[18:22] Hallelujah. Want you to turn around,
[18:23] shake one's hand, welcome each other
[18:26] here. I know we got a lot of guests here
[18:27] this morning. If you have one next to
[18:29] you, make sure you make them welcome
[18:31] today. And amen. I sing that song, paid
[18:34] in full by the blood of the lamb, says
[18:36] G.
[18:39] Paid in full by the blood of the lamb.
[18:45] Oh, free from sin. Free to live. Now I
[18:50] am.
[18:53] And on the page where my sins were
[18:58] written down, paid for by the blood.
[19:02] Well, let's take a long this morning.
[19:04] Sing it again. Oh, paid for by the blood
[19:09] of the lamb.
[19:12] Free from sin. Brea in
[19:21] on the day where my sins were written
[19:25] down. Painful
[19:27] by the blood of the lamb.
[19:34] There was no praise.
[19:38] No one worthy to be found among.
[19:45] What a precious son of God with a cross
[19:49] and thorny crown paid the death with the
[19:53] blood of the lamb.
[19:57] Oh great
[19:59] by the blood. Oh lamb
[20:03] lamb from sin.
[20:07] Now I am
[20:11] your gradful
[20:18] by the blood of the lamb.
[20:23] Oh how great was the debt that I owed
[20:31] for the seeds I had sown.
[20:35] joy in Jesus my Lord. The great treasure
[20:40] I found I redeemed by the blood of the
[20:46] lamb.
[20:50] By the blood
[20:53] of the lamb free from sin, free live.
[20:58] Now I am
[21:02] read on where my sins are written down
[21:07] paid for that last of the lamb.
[21:13] Oh how great was the debt that I owe.
[21:20] bound to pay for the seed I had sown.
[21:26] But if Jesus my Lord great treasure I
[21:31] found
[21:34] by the blood of the lamb

[21:45] Free from sin. Free to live. Now I am
[21:51] in the grape
[21:54] where my sins are written down. Paid for
[21:59] by the blood. Oh paid for
[22:04] painful
[22:05] by the blood of
[22:09] the lamb free from sin.
[22:14] Oh yes, Lord.
[22:17] He's on the p where my sins were written
[22:21] down. Paidful
[22:24] by the blood of the lamb.

[25:31] Hallelujah. Let's be seated. Ask brother
[25:34] Will Robinson if he'd come this morning
[25:36] and bring his special
[25:38] Amen. Let's just worship the Lord
[25:40] together with him.
[26:21] There will be mountains that I will have
[26:26] to climb.
[26:28] And there will be battles that I will
[26:34] have to fight.
[26:36] Victory or defeat,
[26:40] it's up to me to decide.
[26:45] How can I expect to win if I never try?
[26:57] I just can't give up now.
[27:05] I've come too far from where I started
[27:10] out.
[27:14] Nobody told me the road would be easy.
[27:20] And I don't believe he brought me this
[27:24] far to leave me.
[27:28] Never said there wouldn't be trials.
[27:32] Never said I wouldn't fall.
[27:36] Never said that everything would go the
[27:41] way I wanted to go.
[27:44] But when my back is against the wall and
[27:49] I feel a hope is gone,
[27:52] I'll just lift my hands up to the sky.
[27:56] Say, "Help me to be strong.
[28:04] I just can't give up now.
[28:11] I've come too far from where I started
[28:16] out.
[28:20] Nobody told me the road would be easy.
[28:26] And I don't believe he brought me this
[28:30] far to leave me.
[28:34] I know you didn't bring me out here to
[28:39] leave me lonely.
[28:42] Oh, but when I can't see clearly,
[28:46] I know that you are with me now.
[28:52] I just can't give up now.
[28:59] I've come too far from where I'm
[29:02] started.
[29:07] Nobody told me the road would be easy.
[29:14] Don't believe he brought me this far to
[29:18] leave me.
[29:22] I don't believe he brought me this far
[29:26] to leave me.
[29:30] I don't believe he brought me this far
[29:35] to lead me.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that this
[29:52] morning?

[29:57] together. Amazing
[29:59] grace
[30:03] shall always
[30:05] be my song of praise.
[30:12] For it was grace
[30:18] and bought my liberty.
[30:26] I do not know
[30:31] just how he came to love me. So
[30:40] he looked beyond
[30:46] all my faults
[30:48] and he saw my needs.
[30:55] I shall forever
[31:01] lift my eyes to Calary
[31:09] to heal the cross.

[31:21] for me.

[31:30] that calmed my fallen
[31:34] soul.
[31:37] He looked beyond
[31:42] all my faults
[31:45] and he saw my needs.
[31:50] It was God's grace
[31:56] that brought me out of darkness
[32:04] into
[32:06] the light
[32:09] where I can clear the sea.
[32:18] I'll shout it from
[32:22] all the mountains
[32:25] and the valley.
[32:31] He looked me up
[32:36] all my faults.
[32:38] Oh, thank you Jesus.

[33:42] that brought me out of darkness.
[33:49] Oh, into
[33:51] the light
[33:54] where I can clearly see.
[34:02] Oh, I'll shout it from
[34:06] over the mountains
[34:09] and
[34:11] the valleyies.

[37:40] in darkness.
[37:43] There was no motion,
[37:48] no order.
[37:51] You looked upon it.
[37:56] heartbeat
[37:59] knowing the life
[38:02] that you have lived.
[38:07] So you breathe your breath
[38:12] form planets.
[38:15] You hung the stars in
[38:20] their place.
[38:23] Day after day, you
[38:27] you brought order
[38:30] until you stepped back and saw that it
[38:35] was good.
[38:38] You step into the chaos
[38:42] and bring order.
[38:46] You step into sorrow
[38:49] and bring joy.
[38:53] You send your word.
[38:58] And there's healing.
[39:01] The darkness dissolves
[39:04] when you speak.
[39:08] Let there be light. Change
[39:12] every
[39:20] You saw the earth filled
[39:25] with chaos.
[39:28] Barely a light of hope was found.
[39:35] You looked upon it.
[39:40] heartbeat
[39:43] knowing the life that you have led.
[39:50] So you sent your son down
[39:55] to save us to die for the sins of
[40:02] every man.
[40:05] No longer would death be
[40:10] the victory
[40:12] for you triumph
[40:17] and the grave.
[40:20] You step into chaos
[40:24] and bring order.
[40:28] You step into sorrow
[40:31] and bring joy.
[40:35] You send your word
[40:39] and there's healing.
[40:42] The darkness is fall
[40:46] when you speak.
[40:50] You step into chaos
[40:54] and bring order.
[40:57] You step in a sorrow
[41:01] and bring joy.
[41:05] You save your word.
[41:09] And there's healing.
[41:12] The darkness dissolves
[41:16] when you speak.
[41:20] Let there be light.
[41:23] Change everything.
[41:32] Now my night is turned to morning. Now
[41:36] my future is redeemed.
[41:40] My past mistakes are washed away by the
[41:44] cross of Calary.
[41:47] And now heaven is rejoicing.
[41:51] My future homes awaiting
[41:55] me.
[42:00] Cuz you step into chaos
[42:05] and bring order.
[42:08] You step into sorrow
[42:12] and bring joy.
[42:16] You send your word
[42:20] and there's healing.
[42:23] The darkness disorder.
[42:38] You step in the sorrow
[42:41] and bring joy.
[42:45] You send your word
[42:49] and there's healing.
[42:52] The darkness dissolves
[42:56] when you speak.
[43:00] Let there be light. Change
[43:04] everything.
[43:08] Let there be light. Change
[43:12] everything.
[43:28] Praise the Lord. Let's stand together
[43:31] as we go to worship the Lord today.
[43:35] How many would say to him, "Lord, step
[43:37] in to the chaos
[43:41] and bring order. bring order in my life.
[43:45] Speak to me today in in a real and
[43:47] living way. God knows your heart. He
[43:50] knows your need. He knows your
[43:51] situation,
[43:53] the situation in your family, your home.
[43:56] Whatever it is, God is able to step
[43:59] right into it
[44:01] &gt;&gt; and bring it to order.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; These are what he spoke to me. words
[44:06] that he gave to me some
[44:10] weeks ago now in the early morning.
[44:13] Gave me the scripture to go with it.
[44:16] Speaking again on it this morning.
[44:19] But as we're praying, as we're speaking,
[44:21] you just talk to the Lord a minute and
[44:23] you just say to him, "God,
[44:27] step in.
[44:29] Step in." Maybe you look at your life
[44:32] say, "Well, it's it's okay." Well, okay
[44:35] is still chaos.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; We want more than okay.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want the order of God in our
[44:45] lives
[44:47] &gt;&gt; because it's only then
[44:50] we have peace.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Now, let him speak to you today. Father,
[44:54] in the name of Jesus, we ask your grace
[44:57] upon us, Lord, upon this service, your
[45:01] anointing upon every heart. Thou knowest
[45:04] every person, every situation,
[45:07] Lord, the things that they are going
[45:09] through, the issues that they face. And
[45:12] Lord, like we said, we want our lives to
[45:14] be more than okay.
[45:17] We want it to be in divine order.
[45:21] That if you would call us even at this
[45:23] moment, we would be ready to meet you.
[45:26] For we know not what hour you will call.
[45:30] But we do know, Lord, we're in the last
[45:32] days. And we do know that your word has
[45:37] been held for this moment in this time.
[45:41] And any moment, Lord, light will dawn
[45:44] upon the scriptures that has been laying
[45:47] there dormant in the in the Bible for
[45:49] years.
[45:51] And oh God, it will fulfill things like
[45:54] 1 Thessalonians 4 that we which are
[45:57] alive and remain shall be caught up
[45:59] together to meet the Lord in the air.
[46:02] It'll it'll fulfill, oh God, the
[46:06] scripture that speaks out the times of
[46:08] the Gentiles
[46:10] and it coming to an end. But when the
[46:13] bride leaves, the Gentile dispensation
[46:16] is over. Lord, I pray that you'll
[46:18] prepare of a heart. You'll deal with
[46:21] every life. You'll speak to every soul
[46:24] today as we look to you in Jesus name.
[46:28] Amen. God bless you. If you'll turn with
[46:31] me to Genesis chapter 1, we want to read
[46:33] from there. I want to welcome each one
[46:35] of you today in the wonderful name of
[46:38] the Lord Jesus. And I hope that you'll
[46:41] feel at home today in the presence of
[46:44] the Lord.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you don't feel at home in
[46:47] his presence, then I pray that there'll
[46:49] be a change in your life so you can.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's really where we
[46:54] want to find our place is in him.
[46:58] Genesis chapter 1 verse one. In the
[47:01] beginning, God created the heavens and
[47:03] the earth. And the earth was without
[47:06] form and void, and darkness was upon the
[47:08] face of the deep.
[47:10] And the spirit of God moved upon the
[47:14] face of the waters. And God said, "Let
[47:17] there be light." And there was light.
[47:21] God bless you. You can be seated.
[47:24] When we look at these sky and we see a
[47:28] sermon that's actually preached every
[47:30] night and it's a sermon without words.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; It's a majestic order of God that is
[47:37] written across the sky. is a Bible that
[47:40] is written there.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; And in that heavenly order, not one
[47:45] planet wanders, not one star leaves its
[47:48] predestined path. They lo they move in
[47:52] flawless precision and in a heavenly
[47:55] order. They're keeping time like
[47:58] instruments in in a vast holy symphony.
[48:02] It's the Lord's celestial host.
[48:06] And the psalmist declares, "Lift up your
[48:08] eyes on high, and behold, who hath
[48:11] created these things that bringeth out
[48:14] their host by number." And this is not
[48:17] chaos. It is ordered harmony. For each
[48:22] heavenly body, every star within the
[48:26] galaxy, it all marches together in rank,
[48:29] is held steady by divine decree. The
[48:33] moon knows its place.
[48:35] And the sun does not delay nor does it
[48:38] hurry.
[48:40] A and God himself would ask Job, can
[48:43] thou bind the sweet influence of
[48:45] Plleades or loose the bands of Orian?
[48:50] You see, God's universe is a universe
[48:54] built on order. Each star has its own
[48:57] orbit. Each angel has its own rake.
[49:01] And each being was created with a
[49:04] specific calling. As Isaiah chapter 40
[49:08] said, he calleth them all by name. Not
[49:12] one faileth.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; And if we just stop and remember, you
[49:18] know, if he would put everything else in
[49:21] order, certainly he wants our lives in
[49:24] divine order.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; That he also knows our name
[49:28] &gt;&gt; and he calls us by name. each one in our
[49:32] own time. And he'll not fail to do that.
[49:35] Not for one, not for one name written in
[49:38] the Lamb's Book of Life.
[49:40] And if the if the moon was to drift from
[49:43] its usual path, we know the earth would
[49:47] be thrown off of balance and and the the
[49:50] tides would become wild and borders
[49:52] would crumble and and waters would flood
[49:55] back over the land, bringing it back to
[49:57] its original chaotic state where the
[50:01] Bible said, "And the earth was without
[50:03] form and void and darkness was upon the
[50:06] face of the deep." Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Yet that does not happen because
[50:12] creation does not govern itself. It is
[50:15] upheld by the word of God.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:17 says, "By him all things
[50:22] consist." In other words, they are held
[50:25] together. They are sustained. They are
[50:27] restrained. And it says, "And he is
[50:30] before all things."
[50:32] &gt;&gt; This is the God that we serve. We we
[50:35] serve the one who brings order out of
[50:38] chaos.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Who speaks boundaries to the sea and
[50:42] gives laws to the heavens.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; AS JEREMIAH WOULD SAY, "THUS saith the
[50:48] Lord, um which giveth the sun for light
[50:51] by day, if those ordinance depart from
[50:53] before me, sayeth the Lord, then the
[50:55] seed of Israel also shall cease." AND
[50:59] THAT SAME VOICE THAT BROUGHT LIGHT OUT
[51:01] OF darkness is still ruling today.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if God can command the
[51:07] galaxies and if he names the stars and
[51:11] if he keeps oceans in their place, he is
[51:14] more than able to step into human
[51:17] confusion
[51:19] &gt;&gt; into broken lives into disordered hearts
[51:23] and once again speak his word and say,
[51:26] "Let there be Amen.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; You see, he's more than able to step
[51:31] into his church, even a church THAT IS
[51:34] DRIFTING AND OUT OF ORDER, and reach out
[51:37] and bring it into order.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; And how will he do this? He will do this
[51:41] the same way he always has. How did he
[51:45] do it in the beginning? And the spirit
[51:47] of God moved. Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; You see, it is the moving of the spirit
[51:53] upon those chaotic waters that brought
[51:56] it into order as God said, "Let there be
[52:00] light."
[52:01] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice the sequence. The
[52:03] spirit of God moves and the word speaks.
[52:07] And when the word speaks, it brings
[52:09] order to lives. It brings order to the
[52:13] earth. AND LIGHT ALWAYS DAWNS WHEN THE
[52:16] SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES. And when it does,
[52:18] it dispels the chaos.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; It removes the confusion.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; It brings divine order.
[52:26] As we live knowing, you know, here,
[52:30] especially here in the south, we it's
[52:32] very noticeable the changing of the
[52:34] seasons as the light decreases and
[52:37] coldness comes and and our the leaves on
[52:40] the trees retreat and vegetation become
[52:44] dormant and and the growth stops and
[52:47] barrenness and unfruitfulness comes.
[52:50] That that all happens because the light
[52:53] has has decreased. But as the light
[52:57] increases, warmth returns, leaves pop
[53:01] out, fruitfulness returns, birds sing
[53:05] and make their nest, and joy returns as
[53:08] the light increases. And it brings a
[53:11] rapturous hour as the bride and the
[53:14] bridegroom unite.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; AND AS THE LIGHT SHINES UPON THE WORD,
[53:18] then the confusion of the dark ages
[53:22] vanish. Isaiah 30 26 is a notable
[53:26] scripture to me. It says, "Moreover, the
[53:29] light of the moon shall be as the light
[53:31] of the sun." In other words, the bride
[53:34] will match the groom.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That the light of of the bride
[53:39] will be like that of the groom. Notice,
[53:42] AND THEN THE LIGHT OF THE sun shall be
[53:45] sevenfold as the light of seven days in
[53:48] the day that the Lord bindeth at the
[53:50] breach of his people and health the
[53:53] stroke of their wound. SO IN THE VERY
[53:55] DAY THAT HE BINDETH UP THE BREEZE, THAT
[53:58] HE BRINGS a restoration, THAT HE BRINGS
[54:01] A HEALING TO THE CHURCH, THE LIGHT COMES
[54:05] together as a AS NOT JUST THE LIGHT OF
[54:08] ONE AGE, BUT THE LIGHT OF ALL THE AGES
[54:12] &gt;&gt; COMING TOGETHER, SHINING UPON THE LAST
[54:15] AGE TO BRING TO MANIFESTATION EVER
[54:18] DIVINE PROMISE of God and to heal THE
[54:21] WOMB, TO BIND UP THE BROKEN HEART, TO TO
[54:24] SET THE CAPTIVE FREE TO BRING THOSE THAT
[54:27] ARE IN CHAOS OUT OF CHAOS INTO DIVINE
[54:31] ORDER. WE ALSO NOTICE IN IN REVELATION
[54:35] 10 as THE MIGHTY ANGEL, THE ANOINTING OF
[54:38] THE Holy Ghost as it descends here in
[54:41] this LAST DAY THAT HIS FACE as is as it
[54:45] were the sun shining in his strength.
[54:48] You see, IT IS A TIME WHERE THE THE THE
[54:52] SHADOWS, THE TYPES ALL FLEE AWAY AS THE
[54:55] NEGATIVE BECOMES THE POSITIVE AND THINGS
[54:58] THAT WERE HIDDEN in obscurity come into
[55:01] manifestation. AND THE BOOK OF
[55:04] REVELATION THAT WAS CLOTHED IN MYSTERIES
[55:07] AND SYMBOLS BECOME ILLUMINATED and move
[55:10] from mysterious symbols and parables
[55:13] into visible manifestation.
[55:16] AND UNDER THE LIGHT OF THE MIGHTY ANGEL,
[55:19] THE WORD IS RELEASED, and the book that
[55:22] was once sealed to OTHER AGES IS OPENED
[55:25] and revealed. And mysterious voices of
[55:28] thunder become plainly revealed. Why?
[55:32] Because the spirit of God moved.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; And when HE MOVES, IT ALWAYS SPEAKS A
[55:37] WORD that brings light. AMEN.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, GOD'S DESIGN FOR HIS people
[55:44] is has always been perfect order.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; It is not confusion, not instability,
[55:51] not spiritual chaos. Let me just tell
[55:53] you, even personally for your own
[55:56] personal life, YOU YOU KNOW, GOD'S
[55:58] DESIRE FOR YOU IS perfect order.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT CONFUSION. IT'S NOT
[56:04] INSTABILITY.
[56:06] IT'S NOT CHAOS. GOD WANTS TO BRING ORDER
[56:10] INTO YOUR LIFE TO bring where where you
[56:13] lived IN UNHOLINESS AND MAKE IT HOLY.
[56:16] WHERE YOU LIVED IN UNGODLINESS AND MAKE
[56:18] IT GODLY. AMEN. TO WHERE that you YOU
[56:21] ARE CHANGED BY THE POWER OF THE NEW
[56:24] CREATION. AND AND AND BECAUSE THE CHURCH
[56:28] HAS NEVER BEEN INTENDED to aim to to
[56:32] drift AIMLESSLY TO BE PULLED OFF ITS
[56:35] COURSE BY EVERY NEW IDEA OR EVERY WIND
[56:38] OF DOCTRINE. THE THE SCRIPTURE warns us
[56:41] plainly about that in Ephesians 4:14
[56:44] THAT WE ARE NOT TO BE TOSSED uh to and
[56:47] fro cared about every wind of doctrine.
[56:51] THERE IS TO BE CHAOS YOU SEE UPON THE
[56:54] EARTH. BUT GOD COMES TO BRING ORDER INTO
[56:57] THAT CHAOS.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; AND AND ORDER IS NEVER BONDAGE.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; It is protection.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; IT IS THE STABILITY OF THE STABILIZING
[57:07] FORCE OF TRUTH THAT KEEPS THE BODY OF
[57:09] CHRIST ALIGNED WITH THE WILL AND the
[57:12] purpose of God. Amen.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; And our lives, our homes,
[57:17] our assemblies, this church this morning
[57:20] is to move in step with the command of
[57:23] the most high God.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Just as the the heavens do is God told
[57:29] Abraham, "LOOK NOW TOWARD the heavens
[57:32] and TELL THE STARS, SO SHALL THY SEED
[57:35] BE." SO if he put order IN THE HEAVENS,
[57:39] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS order in his church.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants, you know, as he likens
[57:45] his people to the stars, each one he
[57:48] WANTS THEM PLACED, EACH ONE APPOINTED,
[57:51] EACH ONE SHINING IN HIS in his proper
[57:54] position. AND DANIEL SAID, THE THOSE
[57:57] THAT BE WISE shall shine as the
[58:00] brightness of the firminant, AND THOSE
[58:02] THAT TURN MANY to righteousness as the
[58:04] stars forever and ever.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; You see, stars are not random. They're
[58:10] not random lights scattered in
[58:12] confusion. They are fixed. They are
[58:15] ordered. They're governed by God.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; And there is an ORDER THAT WE MUST
[58:21] REMAIN IN. WE MUST STAY POSITIONED
[58:25] AROUND THE SON OF GOD.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Just like THE THE PLANETS IN OUR GALAXY
[58:30] REVOLVE AROUND our son. Even so that we
[58:34] must revolve around the SON OF GOD. EACH
[58:39] one in his place, each one in his orbit.
[58:42] AND TO LEAVE GOD'S word is to bring
[58:45] chaos into your life. TO LEAVE GOD'S
[58:48] PLAN FOR YOUR LIFE is to bring chaos in
[58:51] your life. REMEMBER, ONE STAR OUT OF
[58:55] ORDER WILL BRING CHAOS IN FAMILIES, in
[58:59] churches, IN HOMES. ONE PERSON OUT OF
[59:03] ORDER.
[59:05] SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL COME UNDER
[59:07] THE ORDER OF THE HOLY GHOST
[59:10] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU SEE YOU SEE THAT EVERY ONE
[59:13] OF US YOU KNOW IN order
[59:17] the sen of God and because he said you
[59:21] know that that TO YOU THAT FEAR MY NAME
[59:24] SHALL THE SUN ARISE RIGHTEOUSNESS ARISE
[59:27] WITH HEALING IN HIS WINGS. You see, WHEN
[59:31] WE'RE IN THE PROPER ORDER, THE LIGHT
[59:34] BRINGS HEALING. IT BRINGS DELIVERANCE.
[59:37] IT BRINGS SALVATION. IT IT'LL SAVE THE
[59:41] LOST. IT'LL BRING AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE
[59:44] WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE or young ONE YOUNG
[59:47] CONVERTS CAN BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT
[59:49] OF GOD. IT'LL BRING AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE
[59:52] MIRACLES CAN HAPPEN, WHERE DELIVERANCE
[59:55] TAKES PLACE BECAUSE YOU ARE THERE IN THE
[59:58] PROPER ORDER AROUND THE SON OF GOD.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; NOW, brother Brandham actually preaches
[1:00:04] these things when and this is part of
[1:00:06] where that I draw a lot of things that I
[1:00:09] say this morning in the greatest battle
[1:00:11] ever fought because he said, I looked at
[1:00:14] the heavens and I say how that they have
[1:00:17] stayed in their order. And he said, "If
[1:00:19] God can order the heavens that way, then
[1:00:23] he wants to order his church to be in
[1:00:26] perfect harmony. And if we could get in
[1:00:28] perfect harmony, there wouldn't be any
[1:00:30] sick among us, any lost saved, unsaved,
[1:00:35] right?" Amen. There wouldn't be none.
[1:00:37] Because why? Because perfect order
[1:00:40] brings healing. It puts us in position
[1:00:44] around the son of God. BECAUSE WHEN A
[1:00:47] PLANET LEAVES ITS ORDER, THEN DISORDER
[1:00:51] follows immediately. And in the same way
[1:00:54] when WHEN A BELIEVER STEPS OUT OF
[1:00:57] SPIRITUAL ALIGNMENT OUT FROM UNDER THE
[1:01:00] HEADSHIP OF CHRIST, it doesn't affect
[1:01:03] them alone. THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT THIS
[1:01:06] BODY OF CHRIST and it it is clearly that
[1:01:09] he said THE BODY IS NOT ONE MEMBER but
[1:01:12] many. Amen.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE, WE AFFECT ONE ANOTHER. WE
[1:01:17] ARE A PART OF ONE BODY.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ONE LIFE OUT OF ORDER
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; CAN DISRUPT FAMILIES,
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; CHURCHES, and entire moves of God.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Actually, that's so. Amen. A husband out
[1:01:32] of order,
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; OUT OF HIS PLACE,
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; OUT OF HIS POSITION CAUSES CHAOS WITHIN
[1:01:39] THE FAMILY. A WIFE OUT OF HER PLACE,
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; OUT OF ORDER BRINGS CHAOS INTO THE
[1:01:46] FAMILY. CHILDREN, YOUNG PEOPLE,
[1:01:48] TEENAGERS, OUT OF ORDER BRINGS CHAOS
[1:01:51] INTO A HOME, INTO A FAMILY and into a
[1:01:55] church.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham tells us, he said,
[1:02:01] there's where the church is failing
[1:02:03] today on that walk. Don't you know that
[1:02:07] even your own behavior can knock
[1:02:09] somebody else out of getting healed?
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Think about that. Your own behavior. How
[1:02:16] important then it is that we come into
[1:02:19] the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Where our behavior produces faith
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; and not doubt.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Your misbehavior of
[1:02:30] unconfessed sins of you believers can
[1:02:33] cause this church to bitterly fail. And
[1:02:36] at the day of judgment, you'll be
[1:02:38] responsible for every bit of it.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE WHY? BECAUSE GOD IS NOT THE
[1:02:45] author of confusion,
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; but he's THE AUTHOR OF PEACE as in all
[1:02:50] the churches of the saint. So St. Paul
[1:02:54] said. So heaven moves by divine order
[1:02:57] and the church HAS TO MOVE BY THAT SAME
[1:03:01] ORDER.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY WE MUST CONTINUALLY
[1:03:04] strive and and I don't mean in the flesh
[1:03:07] but in submission to as the Bible said
[1:03:10] TO KEEP THE UNITY OF THE SPIRIT IN THE
[1:03:13] BOND of peace.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. MAYBE YOU HAVE AN IDEA AND
[1:03:18] SOMEBODY ELSE HAS AN IDEA AND and and
[1:03:20] everybody's got opinion like everyone
[1:03:24] has noses.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, we should strive to
[1:03:29] keep the unity of the spirit
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; in the bond of peace. Yes.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; And when we STAY IN OUR GODAPP APPOINTED
[1:03:38] PLACE, when we are yielded to the
[1:03:41] spirit, WHEN WE ARE CENTERED ON CHRIST,
[1:03:45] THEN THE WHOLE PROGRAM of God, it flows
[1:03:48] into harmony.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; It all is a harmonious union working
[1:03:54] together. But when order is broken,
[1:03:58] that's when chaos presses in.
[1:04:01] Therefore, we should walk carefully. We
[1:04:04] should we should stay should stay in our
[1:04:06] own spiritual orbit and and shine there.
[1:04:10] And each one of us exactly where God has
[1:04:13] placed us.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; You know, really this is adoption. This
[1:04:17] is maturity. Adoption is is position
[1:04:21] yourself in the body of Christ. And and
[1:04:24] of course, you know, as as the talents
[1:04:27] are shown in the Bible, he gives you
[1:04:29] some a talent. He gives you uh he gives
[1:04:33] you a portion, but then he expects that
[1:04:36] to to grow and to expand. And if you're
[1:04:40] trustworthy WITH YOU WITH WHAT YOU HAVE,
[1:04:42] he can give you more.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; But he wants increase.
[1:04:48] And what you need to look FOR THIS THIS
[1:04:51] YEAR IN YOUR LIFE IS GOD GIVE ME
[1:04:53] INCREASE in my life.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about more money in your
[1:04:56] pocket.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT A SPIRITUAL increase
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; where THAT THAT YOU YOU GAIN HIGHER
[1:05:04] HEIGHTS that you reach deeper depths
[1:05:07] THAT YOU KNOW GOD IN A GREATER MORE
[1:05:09] RICHER MORE FULLER WAY THAN WHAT you
[1:05:12] have known him in the past.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you AND SO YOU YOU GET IN
[1:05:18] GOD'S ORDER and and you operate that. If
[1:05:21] you are a teenager, you have an order of
[1:05:24] influence around you,
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have a gravitational pull and
[1:05:30] you and others have a pull on you.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; And what DOES THAT DO? THAT THAT
[1:05:38] PRESSURE THAT PULL it it it can bring
[1:05:41] stability or it can bring chaos. Yes.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU'RE PULLED BY ONE WHO'S
[1:05:48] OUT OF HIS ORBIT, it'll also pull you
[1:05:51] into chaos.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; That's why you got to choose your
[1:05:53] friends very wisely.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. To make sure that you am certain
[1:05:58] that you're walking in God's ordained
[1:06:00] path for your life.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Because God has an ordained path, a
[1:06:05] predestinated will for every person's
[1:06:07] life. And you will be a lot happier when
[1:06:10] you find it and walk in it.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:14] Now, TO STEP OUT OF GOD'S APPOINTED
[1:06:18] place is rebellion.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; And really, THAT'S WHAT SIN IS.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; SIN IS REBELLION AGAINST GOD.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; IT'S IN HIS FACE. I'LL DO WHAT I WANT TO
[1:06:32] DO. I'll live how I want to live. It is
[1:06:35] my life. Well, where did you get it?
[1:06:45] It was given to you by God.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; So it was God's to begin with.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; It's only loan to you.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Now what will you do with it?
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Every person has to look at their own
[1:06:59] life.
[1:07:01] They have to make that decision.
[1:07:04] AND TO TO STEP OUT OF GOD'S APPOINTED
[1:07:07] PLACE IS REBELLION. TO LEAVE ONE'S ORDER
[1:07:11] IS TO DISRUPT HARMONY. AND THAT'S WHY
[1:07:14] PAUL'S WARNS THAT LET NO man think of
[1:07:18] himself more highly than he ought to
[1:07:20] think.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; You see, AND HE APPLIES THE SAME
[1:07:24] PRINCIPLE to the order of church
[1:07:26] leadership. I've always found this
[1:07:28] interesting in in 1 Timothy 3 and six
[1:07:31] where he talks about the qualification
[1:07:34] of of leadership in the church. And he
[1:07:37] says very clearly, "Not a novice,
[1:07:41] lest being lifted up with pride, he fall
[1:07:44] into condemnation of the devil."
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; H I wonder what that is.
[1:07:52] Let's talk about it for a moment. To
[1:07:55] step into authority before God places
[1:07:59] you there is to repeat the original
[1:08:02] rebellion of Lucifer,
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; right? AMEN. THE BIBLE SAID IN 1
[1:08:08] CORINTHIANS 12:18, GOD HAS SET THE
[1:08:12] MEMBERS OF EVERY ONE OF THEM IN THE BODY
[1:08:15] AS IT PLEASED HIM.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; SO GOD SETS, HE ORDERS THE places and
[1:08:23] you never WANT TO MOVE OUT OF THE PLACE
[1:08:25] THAT GOD HAS SET YOU IN.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; You want to stay right there.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and there again, you don't
[1:08:36] move until God moves you.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; You don't force things to happen.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; A lot of times, you know, young people
[1:08:43] want to get married and so they force
[1:08:45] situations to make it work.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Many times they pray and they pray,
[1:08:51] "Lord, let this be your will." That's
[1:08:53] the wrong way to pray.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, what is your will?"
[1:08:58] Amen.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Because you can get God's permissive
[1:09:04] will
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; and to WALK IN HIS PERMISSIVE WILL
[1:09:07] ALWAYS BRINGS CHAOS.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY WE'RE BORN THE WAY WE'RE
[1:09:13] BORN. AND WE WERE ALL BORN IN SIN IS
[1:09:15] BECAUSE OF THE PERMISSIVE WILL
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; GIVEN TO OUR FIRST parents
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; who left God's perfect will and they
[1:09:21] chose chaos over divine order. Yes.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Now, SO TO MOVE BEYOND THAT PLACEMENT,
[1:09:29] WHETHER BY AMBITION or why by
[1:09:32] self-promotion or or others pushing into
[1:09:35] there, it's to disrupt harmony.
[1:09:38] AS BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IT THIS WAY,
[1:09:40] now everybody can't be a preacher, but
[1:09:43] you got a voice.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; And if you're a preacher, you're called
[1:09:48] to the pulpit to preach.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; I wish Jeffersonville would listen to
[1:09:52] that.
[1:09:54] we wouldn't have the chaos that's coming
[1:09:56] out of there
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; because if you're a preacher, the
[1:09:59] prophet said you are called to the
[1:10:02] pulpit to preach.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE NOT, YOU'RE STILL A PREACHER,
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU LIVE THE PEOPLE A SERMON.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; SO, YOU GOT TO REALIZE YOUR LIFE IS AN
[1:10:15] INFLUENCE.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; YES, it is.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S A PULL UPON OTHERS.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And you want to see what kind of
[1:10:23] influence that you're that you are
[1:10:26] bringing upon a person's life.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Are you causing them come closer to
[1:10:30] Christ or pushing them into rebellion?
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; You see, he said, "Let your sermon be
[1:10:37] lived. It is the voice of God that'll
[1:10:40] bring the reproach to them who reject
[1:10:43] it." They said, "No one can put a finger
[1:10:46] on his or her life, their sweet living.
[1:10:49] If there ever was a man of God, if that
[1:10:51] man or that woman, you see, you live
[1:10:54] your sermon. It It's Don't try to preach
[1:10:57] them if you're not called to be a
[1:10:59] preacher. Uh you'll GET IT ALL MIXED UP
[1:11:02] ANYWAY, MESSED UP, and you'll get people
[1:11:05] tangled up and you won't KNOW WHAT
[1:11:07] YOU'LL RUIN THEM AND YOURSELF, TOO. Just
[1:11:11] live your sermon.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; The preacher is called to preach his and
[1:11:17] live it, too. AND HE SAYS, "IF YOU CAN'T
[1:11:20] LIVE IT, THEN stop preaching."
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're supposed to live your
[1:11:24] sermons.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; But you see, often it's pride. Pride
[1:11:30] places the man a man in the same
[1:11:34] spiritual position that Lucifer occupied
[1:11:37] when he fell.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; You Lucifer's fall was the result of
[1:11:42] selfexaltation. That's right.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; AGAIN, THE FIRST AND FOREMOST OF ALL SIN
[1:11:50] really comes with,
[1:11:52] you know, this this word, this phrase, I
[1:11:58] will.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS WHAT LUCIFER SAID IN THE
[1:12:04] BEGINNING. I WILL.
[1:12:09] AND WHEN YOU EXALT YOUR WILL OVER GOD'S
[1:12:11] WILL, WHICH IS HIS WORD,
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; THEN ALWAYS REBELLION HAPPENS. AND GUESS
[1:12:17] WHAT? IT DON'T JUST AFFECT YOU.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; BUT WITH LUCIFER'S FALL, THERE WERE
[1:12:23] OTHERS THAT FELL WITH him
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; because of the influence. Amen.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; AND EZEKIEL DESCRIBES IT in Ezekiel
[1:12:32] 28:17.
[1:12:33] Thine heart was lifted up because of thy
[1:12:36] beauty, and thou has corrupted thy
[1:12:39] wisdom by reason of thy brightness.
[1:12:43] So you see, when he fell, HE DIDN'T FALL
[1:12:46] ALONE. IF YOU LOOK WITH ME IN IN
[1:12:49] Revelation 12:4, and his tail drew the
[1:12:53] third part of the stars of heaven, and
[1:12:55] it cast them to the earth.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; So, not only did he fall, he caused
[1:13:01] others to fall, too.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; And those who followed his rebellion
[1:13:06] shared his judgment,
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; and they left their design, their
[1:13:09] assigned order, and they WERE CAST OUT
[1:13:12] OF GOD'S PRESENCE.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO HERE'S THE UNCHANGING TRUTH I
[1:13:16] WANT TO GET YOU TODAY AND THAT IS GOD'S
[1:13:19] ORDER brings life.
[1:13:22] If you remember in the beginning when HE
[1:13:24] WHAT WAS HE DOING BY BY THE LIGHT HE WAS
[1:13:28] PRODUCING THE ENERGY to bring all life
[1:13:31] from
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; AND THERE AGAIN SELF-EXALTATION
[1:13:36] always brings chaos
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; and so Lucifer he broke divine order how
[1:13:44] by seeking God's place
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; do you notice he says in Isaiah
[1:13:50] Isaiah that he says it like this. You
[1:13:53] know, I will exalt myself above the sons
[1:13:58] of God.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; I WILL BE LIKE THE MOST HIGH.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; WELL, we all want to be like Jesus.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; But that ain't what he was saying.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; I want to take his place.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; I want his position.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; I want the worship that belongs to him.
[1:14:20] And he's
[1:14:22] he broke that divine order. AND HE'S
[1:14:25] BEEN TRYING EVER SINCE TO REPRODUCE THE
[1:14:28] SAME DISORDER AMONG GOD'S people
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; by tempting MEN TO LEAVE THEIR CALLINGS
[1:14:34] TO SEEK PRO PROMINENCE TO TO DRAW
[1:14:37] WORSHIP TO THEMSELVES.
[1:14:40] But all of heaven AND THOSE WHO DWELL IN
[1:14:42] HEAVENLY PLACES, THEY'LL ALL STILL STAND
[1:14:45] AS GOD DESIGNED IT. EVER BEING IN HIS
[1:14:47] PLACE, EVERY VOICE IN HARMONY WITH THE
[1:14:51] WORD OF GOD, AND EVERY CROWN CAST at his
[1:14:54] feet.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; And that's the lesson we want to learn
[1:14:58] from this today is that we want to stay
[1:15:00] in God's appointed order
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; because that's life. Amen.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; AND EXALT OURSEL is to repeat the oldest
[1:15:08] re rebellion in the universe as a and
[1:15:11] and and we want we want God's order not
[1:15:16] the disorder that Satan brings.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; So you see rebellion is a sin. IT
[1:15:22] DOESN'T MATTER. GOD PLACES headship in
[1:15:24] your life.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD PLACES HEADSHIP IN your life.
[1:15:30] He puts a A MAN UNDER CHRIST. CHRIST is
[1:15:34] his head.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; MEN OF GOD, THE WORD OF GOD IS YOUR
[1:15:40] HEAD.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; FOR THE FAMILY, EVEN FOR THE WIFE, THE
[1:15:44] CHILDREN, THE WORD OF GOD IS STILL THE
[1:15:46] HEAD.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; BUT PRIMARILY THE MAN STANDS IN THAT
[1:15:50] PLACE OF RESPONSIBILITY. CHRIST AS HIS
[1:15:54] HEAD, HIS WORDGIVEN preeminence
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; over his own reasoning, OVER HIS OWN
[1:16:00] THOUGHTS, OVER HIS OWN AMBITIONS, OVER
[1:16:02] HIS own desires,
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; he puts the word first,
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; and I'll tell you what, the quicker you
[1:16:10] learn to seek first
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; the kingdom of God
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; and its righteousness,
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; the quicker you learn that, the more
[1:16:21] that you will have the things the right
[1:16:23] things added to you. I want a wife. I
[1:16:26] want a husband. I want a family. I want
[1:16:30] I want wealth. I WANT THIS. I WANT THAT.
[1:16:33] IT COMES FROM WHERE? SEEKING FIRST.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God, that's the Holy
[1:16:41] Ghost.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; How many times have I preached to you?
[1:16:44] THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO SEEK FIRST THE HOLY GHOST
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; AND HIS DIVINE ORDER IN YOUR LIFE
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; AND then in his time
[1:16:56] everything
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; will be added to you.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; BUT TO STEP OUT OF GOD'S APPOINTED way
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; will bring disorder in your life. Amen.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; It'll bring confusion, hurt, harm,
[1:17:13] sorrow because that's all the wages that
[1:17:17] sin pays.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; So you see,
[1:17:23] the scripture tells us AS WE STARTED OFF
[1:17:27] IN GENESIS 1:2, THE EARTH WAS WITHOUT
[1:17:31] FORM AND VOID, AND darkness was upon the
[1:17:34] face of the deep.
[1:17:36] At that point, it wasn't suitable for
[1:17:38] life.
[1:17:40] IT WAS SHAPELESS. IT WAS EMPTY. It was
[1:17:44] covered in darkness.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; You know, there's times that things
[1:17:50] ain't just suitable for life.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Young man, until you get the Holy Ghost,
[1:17:58] you're not suitable for life. That's
[1:18:00] right.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN STEP OUT of order and go ahead
[1:18:03] and get you a wife and you'll find one
[1:18:05] out of your own desires and you'll eat
[1:18:07] the fruits of it.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Young lady, THE SAME THING. YOU STEP OUT
[1:18:11] OF GOD'S ORDER.
[1:18:14] And God's order is his word. So, you
[1:18:17] want someone with a holy taste, WITH A
[1:18:19] WITH A WITH A DESIRE FOR GOD, WITH WITH
[1:18:22] A HUNGER FOR HIM AND AND AND GOD IS HIS
[1:18:25] HEAD.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? AMEN.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO YOU SEE WHEN IT WAS WHEN THIS
[1:18:32] when the IN GENESIS 1 THE EARTH WAS
[1:18:35] WITHOUT FORM IT WAS VOID. DARKNESS WAS
[1:18:38] ON THE FACE OF THE DEEP. IT WASN'T
[1:18:40] suitable for life. This is what you
[1:18:42] want. You want to get your life in
[1:18:45] order.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; So it is suitable for life.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; At that point THE EARTH WAS SHAPELESS,
[1:18:53] EMPTY, COVERED IN DARKNESS.
[1:18:56] BUT I WANT YOU TO NOTICE THIS. IT WASN'T
[1:18:59] abandoned
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; and it wasn't forgotten.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; And I want you to KNOW EVEN IN WHEREVER
[1:19:07] YOU ARE TODAY, YOU ARE NOT FORGOTTEN
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE not abandoned.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; OH NO. OH NO. WE LISTEN. GOD SEES THE
[1:19:18] DISORDER
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S GOT THE RIGHT MOVEMENT
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; LIGHT SPRINGS UP
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORD SPEAKS
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; AND THEN THE PATH BECOMES ILLUMINATED
[1:19:36] THEN YOU CAN WALK IN THAT light
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; and in that light is health is healing
[1:19:42] is restoration
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; is mercy Yes,
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; but there chaos was present. But so was
[1:19:54] the spirit.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; And this is always God's pattern. When
[1:19:59] disorder exists, the spirit moves.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; And sometimes YOU THINK THE CHAOS CAN'T
[1:20:07] GET ANY WORSE.
[1:20:10] And I'll tell you, you don't want it to.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU DON'T WANT IT TO. WHAT YOU
[1:20:18] WANT IS GOD TO STEP INTO YOUR CHAOS
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; AND LET HIS SPIRIT MOVE.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; LET IT BRING ILLUMINATION TO WHERE
[1:20:27] YOU'RE AT.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; And let IT BEGIN TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE AND
[1:20:31] TRANSFORM YOU LIKE IT DID THE EARTH
[1:20:34] UNTIL IT BECAME A GARDEN OF EDEN. AMEN.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; A place where God could meet with his
[1:20:42] sons and daughters,
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; where he could bring life and joy and
[1:20:47] peace.
[1:20:50] And this is where what God does. He
[1:20:53] moves. He doesn't move to destroy. He
[1:20:57] moves to prepare it, to bring it to
[1:20:59] divine order. And God isn't out to
[1:21:03] destroy your life.
[1:21:05] He is there to bring it in order.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; OH, NOW MAYBE IT MIGHT DESTROY THE SIN
[1:21:15] IN YOUR LIFE,
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; BUT IN DOING SO, IT'LL BRING ORDER,
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THAT ORDER WILL BRING PEACE
[1:21:26] AND THAT ORDER WILL BRING HARMONY. AND
[1:21:28] THAT ORDER WILL BRING JOY NOT JUST TO
[1:21:31] YOU BUT YES TO YOU PRIMARILY BUT TO ALL
[1:21:34] AROUND YOU.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID IF A MAN'S WAYS PLEASE
[1:21:40] THE LORD THAT EVEN HIS enemies will be
[1:21:42] at peace with him.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; So this is where God brings order out of
[1:21:52] chaos.
[1:21:55] As the world was then, it could not
[1:21:57] sustain life. It was uninhabitable.
[1:22:01] But then came the turning point of all
[1:22:04] history. And the spirit of God moved.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; And when he moves, HE RELEASED A WORD.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; AND THAT WORD SAID, "LET THERE BE
[1:22:18] LIGHT." AMEN.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; AND I TELL YOU, WHEN THE DAY STAR, THE
[1:22:25] LIGHT SHINES INTO A DARKENED SOUL,
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; IT'LL TRANSFORM IT FROM SOMETHING THAT
[1:22:31] IS IN UPHEAVAL AND ON A PATH MEANT FOR
[1:22:34] DESTRUCTION AND A WORLD THAT IS FILLED
[1:22:37] WITH WITH EVIL and turn it AROUND AND
[1:22:40] MAKE A SON OR DAUGHTER OF GOD OUT AND
[1:22:42] PUT YOU IN ORBIT AROUND HIMSELF.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AMEN. where the sun of
[1:22:47] righteousness can shine on your life and
[1:22:49] bring healing
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; with the wings of the morning as it
[1:22:53] dawns
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; on your life.
[1:22:58] And God said
[1:23:00] because every time God speaks, he brings
[1:23:04] order.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; When God gives his word, he sends a
[1:23:09] message.
[1:23:12] And it's always to confront confusion.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, that's why God sent a
[1:23:18] message in this day.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; It was sent to confront confusion.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; AND TO RESTORE DIVINE ALIGNMENT.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THIS IS WHY HE SENT THE
[1:23:30] MESSAGE IN THE END time to bring a
[1:23:32] people INTO DIVINE ORDER FOR WHAT? A
[1:23:36] RAPTURE. YEAH.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; TO GET YOU UP
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; out of this WORLD OF CHAOS.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORLD WE LIVE IN IS GOING TO
[1:23:44] BURN WITH IN UN INQUENCHABLE FIRE.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT THERE IS A PEOPLE THAT WILL BE
[1:23:50] CAUGHT UP INTO ORBIT AROUND HIM
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; WHO WILL BE SAVED FROM THE WRATH THAT IS
[1:23:55] TO COME.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And the Bible tells you in Psalms
[1:24:02] 33:6,
[1:24:04] "By the word of the Lord were the
[1:24:06] heavens made." And I'll tell you, by the
[1:24:09] word of the Lord,
[1:24:11] the heavens are made, and all the host
[1:24:13] of them by the breath of his mouth.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; For when his word is spoken,
[1:24:18] light appears.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Every time his word comes, light comes.
[1:24:26] As it said, LET THERE BE LIGHT AND THERE
[1:24:29] was light.
[1:24:31] LIGHT ALWAYS DISPELS THE DARKNESS. IT
[1:24:35] EXPOSES THAT WHICH WAS HIDDEN. IT SHINES
[1:24:39] A LIGHT ON THE HIDDEN TACTICS OF THE
[1:24:41] DEVIL. It separates truth from
[1:24:45] confusion. SO THAT PEOPLE WHO SAT IN THE
[1:24:47] REGIONS of the shadow of death see a
[1:24:50] great light
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; and they come out of that death
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; in the light.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; That's what Isaiah declared. The people
[1:24:59] that walked in darkness have seen a
[1:25:01] great light. You see darkness in the
[1:25:04] scripture
[1:25:06] is a
[1:25:07] darkness in scripture is not the absence
[1:25:09] of imp information. We all have Bibles.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. But darkness in scripture is the
[1:25:19] absence of revelation.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND.
[1:25:24] THEY SAY, "WELL, WE GOT THE BIBLE. WHAT
[1:25:25] DO WE NEED RESTORATION FOR?" WELL, YOU
[1:25:28] KNOW WHAT needed to be RESTORED WAS THE
[1:25:30] REVELATION. AMEN.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT DID WE HAVE? WE HAD WE HAD
[1:25:36] 40,000 DENOMINATIONAL INTERPRETATIONS.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; And we NEED TO KNOW WHAT GOD SAID
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; ABOUT THIS SUBJECT,
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; NOT FILTER THROUGH WHAT MAN SAYS.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Because man always does like Eve did in
[1:25:53] the beginning. And Satan as he comes and
[1:25:55] questions the word, the serpent to Eve,
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; ye hath God said,
[1:26:01] to twist
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; what God said.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; So you see that's why God's word does
[1:26:12] more than inform the mind. It comes to
[1:26:15] transform the life.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; God wants to do more for you people than
[1:26:21] give you an education in the Bible.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; He wants to transform your life.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I MEAN, WE GOT THEOLOGIANS SITTING
[1:26:33] ON MESSAGE PEWS EVERYWHERE. WE'VE MADE
[1:26:36] THEOLOGIANS OUT OF THEM. THEY KNOW THIS
[1:26:38] AND THEY KNOW THAT AND THEY UNDERSTAND
[1:26:39] THIS. BUT DO THEY KNOW GOD?
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; WE GOT PEOPLE WHO CAN UNDERSTAND
[1:26:46] CONCEPTS
[1:26:47] AND SAY IT ALL MAKES SENSE. IT ALL MAKES
[1:26:50] SENSE AND IT'S SENSIBLE AND IT'S
[1:26:52] REASONABLE. BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT IT
[1:26:55] BEING SENSIBLE AND REASONABLE. IT'S
[1:26:57] ABOUT TRANSFORMING,
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; changing you.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it don't start with just one
[1:27:05] glory. It's from glory to glory
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; that he changes you.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; So when God speaks, his word cuts
[1:27:15] through the darkness.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; It exposes what's been hidden.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; IT CALLS THE PEOPLE OUT OF confusion and
[1:27:22] to his marvelous light. Yes.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; This is what Peter said. You know, HE
[1:27:27] HATH CALLED YOU OUT OF DARKNESS.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; HE CALLED YOU OUT OF THE CONFUSION.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE CALLED YOU OUT OF THAT CHAOS.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT HE WAS DOING TO THE EARTH.
[1:27:38] HE WAS CALLING THE EARTH WITH THAT WAS
[1:27:40] DARK WITHOUT FORM AND DARKNESS COVERED
[1:27:42] THE FACES. HE WAS CALLING IT OUT OF
[1:27:45] CHAOS
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; INTO THE marvelous light.
[1:27:51] So the light could bring forth
[1:27:54] the purpose,
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; the plan of God.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; So every time God speaks,
[1:28:01] every time God sends a message, order is
[1:28:05] restored.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Confusion gives way to clarity and
[1:28:10] turmoil will give way to peace. And
[1:28:13] wandering gives away to direction.
[1:28:17] Because why? The word is a a lamp unto
[1:28:21] my feet and a light unto my path.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID WHEN WHEN GOD
[1:28:29] STEPPED INTO OUR CHAOS HERE IN THE
[1:28:31] LEODYSIAN AGE OF CHRIST REJECTING AGE
[1:28:34] AND HE STEPPED INTO THE CHAOS.
[1:28:37] DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? TRUTH THAT
[1:28:40] HAD BEEN BURIED under misunderstandings
[1:28:42] and misapplications
[1:28:44] is suddenly made plain.
[1:28:48] For by the Bible said, "At the appointed
[1:28:50] time, the vision shall speak."
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; God had an appointed time for the vision
[1:28:56] to speak.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; God held a whole book of revelation.
[1:29:00] Come on, somebody. For an end time
[1:29:03] people
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; so the vision would speak to them
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; TO DO WHAT? TO BRING THEM OUT OF
[1:29:08] CONFUSION.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; TO SHINE A LIGHT OF GOD ON GLORIOUS
[1:29:12] TRUTH. TO BRING A TRANSFORMATION IN YOUR
[1:29:15] LIFE. TO TAKE YOU FROM JUST A RELIGIOUS
[1:29:18] CHURCH MEMBER AND TRANSFORM YOU INTO A
[1:29:21] SON OR DAUGHTER OF GOD AND MAKE YOU A
[1:29:24] PART OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; That's what he does.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; What looked chaotic
[1:29:32] is simply
[1:29:34] waiting for the right moment for God to
[1:29:36] bring it to order.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; And I want I want you just to even think
[1:29:41] about the chaos in your life.
[1:29:44] What looks chaotic
[1:29:47] is simply waiting for that right moment
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; for divine encounter.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. For him to pass by your way
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; as he did the woman at the well.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Waiting for that right moment for God to
[1:30:04] bring it to order. Amen.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Take that just for a MOMENT
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; AND THINK ABOUT YOUR PRODALS
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; AND THE CHAOTIC CONDITION THAT THEY'RE
[1:30:15] IN AND HOW MUCH MORE OF A MESS CAN THEY
[1:30:19] GET THEIR LIVES IN. WE DON'T WANT to
[1:30:21] know how much more.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, what looks chaotic
[1:30:27] is simply waiting for the right moment
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; for God to bring it into order.
[1:30:35] Hallelujah.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:40] AMEN. I I I LOOK UPON THE FACE OF MEN
[1:30:43] AND WOMEN AND I CAN CALL YOU ONE BY ONE
[1:30:46] AND ONE BY ONE AND LOOK AT SEEING LIVES
[1:30:50] THAT WERE IN CHAOS.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS JUST WAITING FOR THAT RIGHT
[1:30:56] MOMENT
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; FOR THE SPIRIT OF GOD TO MOVE. AND WHEN
[1:31:00] HE MOVED, HE BROUGHT LIGHT INTO A
[1:31:03] DARKENED SOUL. AND HE CHANGED AND
[1:31:06] TRANSFORMED YOU.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; That's the power of the new creation.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; That's the power of the blood.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; You know, this is what happened when
[1:31:20] God's word came to Luther. The scripture
[1:31:23] had already been there. He didn't go and
[1:31:25] find a new Bible.
[1:31:28] He didn't go and write a a a new verse
[1:31:31] in it
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; and say, "I tell you what, I want to
[1:31:35] change this. The Catholics have got me
[1:31:37] there. We're doing this penance and
[1:31:39] we're paying for
[1:31:42] souls out of purgatory and we're we're
[1:31:45] burning candles that we have to pay for
[1:31:47] to to to get sins remitted and all kinds
[1:31:50] OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON."
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; BUT THE SCRIPTURE HAD ALWAYS BEEN THERE.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; YES. RIGHT.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; But that DAY, THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; And when IT DID, IT SHONE LIGHT ON A
[1:32:02] WORD.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; AND THAT WORD BEGAN TO TRANSFORM THE
[1:32:06] CHURCH. THAT WORD WAS THE JUST SHALL
[1:32:09] LIVE BY FAITH.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. But it had been buried beneath
[1:32:15] creeds and systems that taught salvation
[1:32:18] by works.
[1:32:20] But when God illuminated that word,
[1:32:23] light broke through centuries of
[1:32:25] darkness.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Faith was restored in order to return
[1:32:30] where chaos had once ruled.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; The same pattern followed when when God
[1:32:37] spoke through Wesley.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Light shown on truth that that God is
[1:32:43] holy and that he calls his people to
[1:32:46] live holy lives. Be ye holy, for I am
[1:32:49] holy.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; That truth had not disappeared from the
[1:32:55] scripture.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; It's right there. First Peter 1:16, you
[1:32:59] can put it up for all to see.
[1:33:02] THAT TRUTH HAD NOT DISAPPEARED FROM
[1:33:04] SCRIPTURE. IT WAS ALWAYS THERE. But it
[1:33:07] had been neglected.
[1:33:10] BUT WHEN GOD BREATHED ON IT,
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE BREATHED ON IT AGAIN, HEARTS
[1:33:17] WERE AWAKENED AND LIVES WERE CHANGED AND
[1:33:20] HOLINESS WAS RESTORED TO ITS RIGHTFUL
[1:33:23] PLACE.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; You see, this is God's way. His word
[1:33:33] doesn't change.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; And when he sends a message, we don't
[1:33:36] need to rewrite the Bible. Amen.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Neither do we need a 23rd chapter.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. To the book of Revelation. We
[1:33:47] don't need an additional CHAPTER
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; TO WRITE OUR REVELATIONS IN.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; NO, SIR. THE WORD DOESN'T CHANGE. BUT
[1:33:55] WHAT CHANGES IS OUR ABILITY TO SEE IT.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE BRINGS LIGHT
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; AND NOTHING CAN SEE WITHOUT LIGHT.
[1:34:10] AND WHENEVER LIGHT COMES, DARKNESS MUST
[1:34:13] FLEE. AND WHEN THE DARKNESS FLEES,
[1:34:16] DIVINE ORDER IS ONCE AGAIN ESTABLISHED.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; That's why a message from God was needed
[1:34:22] in this end time.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; A messenger sent from the presence of
[1:34:26] God,
[1:34:28] stepped into our world to bring us out
[1:34:31] of chaos. Amen.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; I want you to know, friends, God not
[1:34:36] only showed his love 2,000 years ago,
[1:34:40] but he has reconfirmed his love to a
[1:34:43] generation
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; that he will not let us remain in
[1:34:47] darkness.
[1:34:54] God sent a messenger and a messenger, an
[1:34:57] angel stepped into our world to bring us
[1:35:01] out of CHAOS THAT WAS CAUSED BY YEARS of
[1:35:05] misinterpreted theology.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Think about it. You know, AS THE ANGEL
[1:35:13] APPEARED TO MARY, HIS message to her was
[1:35:17] was, "Greetings, Mary. You're highly
[1:35:20] favored of the Lord.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; And I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU RECEIVING A
[1:35:25] MESSAGE IN THIS DAY MEANS YOU ARE HIGHLY
[1:35:28] FAVORED.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Chosen of God.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. For a purpose.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; BUT THE ONLY WAY TO BRING THAT ORDER OUT
[1:35:38] IS FOR THE Holy Ghost to overshadow you.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; So that that holy thing that is born of
[1:35:45] you is not of a denomination or of man.
[1:35:49] but of the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; So there in Genesis
[1:35:55] as God continued to speak, life unfolded
[1:35:59] into divine order.
[1:36:01] First it was just simple forms.
[1:36:04] You know it was light
[1:36:07] and then was separation
[1:36:10] because anytime light comes separation
[1:36:14] follows. That's right.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; The darkness flees.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; It retreats
[1:36:20] and then you know as as it went went
[1:36:23] from there and land appeared and so ON
[1:36:26] AND THEN PLANT LIFE AND then living
[1:36:28] creatures. YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS was the
[1:36:31] result of THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVING.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; AND WORD BEING RELEASED, A MESSAGE BEING
[1:36:39] RELEASED FROM the spirit
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; that brought light.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:44] A word brought light. Let there be
[1:36:48] light.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; So the first thing out of God was the
[1:36:51] logos of God, the pillar of fire. And
[1:36:54] from that all creation begins.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; That's why he is before all things. And
[1:37:00] by him all things are created that were
[1:37:02] created.
[1:37:08] And so it BEGAN TO BRING FORTH PLANT
[1:37:10] LIFE,
[1:37:11] living creatures.
[1:37:14] And then each stage would build upon the
[1:37:17] last moving steadily
[1:37:20] because God has a design
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; and God has a purpose. You may remember
[1:37:26] a message that and and this is going way
[1:37:28] back maybe back uh 25 years where I
[1:37:32] preached to you on on on um on God's
[1:37:36] purpose and God's crowning achievement.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE GOD HAS A A CROWNING
[1:37:42] ACHIEVEMENT THERE. THERE'S an
[1:37:44] achievement that he is a design that he
[1:37:48] has a plan that he has in mind.
[1:37:51] and and every time that he moves, he he
[1:37:55] he looks on it and and he says, "That's
[1:37:58] good,
[1:38:00] but I got more,"
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; WHEN WHEN THE LIGHT DAWN AND AND UPON
[1:38:07] LUTHER, God looked on it and said,
[1:38:09] "That's good. The just shall live by
[1:38:12] faith."
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; And that was good.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; But God wasn't through.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; He had more to bring up
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; to restore order.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God would would say, "Let there
[1:38:32] be light." And and then he would say he
[1:38:34] would see the manifestation and he say
[1:38:37] that's good. And then that order
[1:38:40] produced goodness.
[1:38:42] But you know chaos never does.
[1:38:45] And finally, God reaches his crowning
[1:38:49] act of creation.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; If you'll turn with me to Genesis 1:26,
[1:38:56] you'll see it. And God said,
[1:39:00] now this SAME ONE THAT SAID, "LET THERE
[1:39:02] BE LIGHT."
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE SAME ONE. THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[1:39:08] MOVED.
[1:39:10] NOW THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS BRINGING LIGHT
[1:39:12] UPON ALL HIS PURPOSE OF WHAT HE wanted
[1:39:17] to bring
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID LET US MAKE MAN AFTER OUR
[1:39:21] likeness
[1:39:23] and let them have dominion.
[1:39:26] So you see
[1:39:29] this was God's crowning achievement
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; to finally REPRODUCE HIMSELF
[1:39:37] ON THE EARTH. AMEN.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let let me tell YOU SOMETHING,
[1:39:43] FRIENDS. I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT GOD HAS
[1:39:45] DONE IN YOUR LIFE, IT MAY BE WONDERFUL,
[1:39:47] BUT UNTIL UNTIL HE reproduces his
[1:39:50] likeness.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN. UNTIL HE COMES WITH THE
[1:39:55] INDDWELLING OF HIS HOLY SPIRIT,
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; UNTIL HE PRODUCES A CROWNED ACHIEVEMENT,
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; don't give up on the plan OF GOD AND GO
[1:40:05] BACK INTO CHAOS.
[1:40:08] DON'T RECEIVE BACK INTO DARKNESS. IT
[1:40:10] ONLY PROVES YOU ARE OF DARKNESS.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. LET HIM THAT STOLE STEAL NO MORE.
[1:40:17] LET HIM THAT COMMITTED ADULTERY DO IT NO
[1:40:20] MORE. PUT BEHIND YOU THE THE WORKS OF
[1:40:23] DARKNESS.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Seek the Lord with all your heart.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Serve him with everything you have
[1:40:32] within you.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Why? because God wants to add to that.
[1:40:41] And I'll tell you, I'll tell you, after
[1:40:45] 6,000 years,
[1:40:47] God is finally reaching his crowning act
[1:40:50] of creation.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; As the last age reveals himself as the
[1:40:56] beginning of the creation of God,
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; what creation is that? is a bride, a
[1:41:02] people in his image that's after his
[1:41:05] likeness. So what you're seeing right
[1:41:08] here as the earth came to this point, to
[1:41:12] this apex, TO THIS CAPSTONE, EVEN SO GOD
[1:41:16] IS DOING NOW WITH ALL OF WHAT HE'S DONE
[1:41:19] SINCE HE CREATED the world. He didn't
[1:41:22] create the world so we could go and mess
[1:41:24] it UP AND BRING CHAOS AND SIN AND
[1:41:26] UNBELIEF ON IT. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE DID
[1:41:28] IT FOR. HE CREATED A WORLD WHERE THAT HE
[1:41:31] COULD BRING FORTH HIS LIKENESS.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE GOD WANTED A FAMILY.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS WHAT GOD'S ACHIEVEMENT IS.
[1:41:43] HIS ACHIEVEMENT is not a Lutheran church
[1:41:45] OR A METHODIST CHURCH OR A PENTECOSTAL
[1:41:47] CHURCH. GOD'S CROWN AND ACHIEVEMENT WILL
[1:41:49] BE A BRIDE WITHOUT SPOT OR WRINKLE. A
[1:41:53] PEOPLE IN HIS IMAGE, A PEOPLE OF HIS
[1:41:54] LIKENESS,
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; a people who moves as he moves, WHO IS
[1:41:59] IN ORBIT AROUND HIM, WHO IS AHEAD, WHO
[1:42:02] GIVES him the preeminence.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; So you see, let me even tell you,
[1:42:13] God's done great things in this day. He
[1:42:16] sent a message, but the message is not
[1:42:18] his achievement.
[1:42:22] God sent a prophet, but his prophet is
[1:42:24] not what he was trying to achieve.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; That's what message people get confused
[1:42:29] about. They think it's about a prophet.
[1:42:31] Is not about a prophet.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; It's about a bride.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; AND IT IS A ABOUT ABOUT A PROPHET
[1:42:43] BECOMING HIS VOICE. IT'S ABOUT A BRIDE
[1:42:45] BECOMING HIS VOICE.
[1:42:48] GOD WANTS MORE THAN ONE MAN IN HIS HAND.
[1:42:51] HE WANTS EVERY ONE OF YOU IN HIS HAND.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO BE THE FINAL VOICE TO
[1:42:56] THE FINAL AGE.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; To be the people of his likeness,
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; to be a people in his image.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; So is so you see when we look at man,
[1:43:13] man's not an accident of chaos.
[1:43:17] Like the evolutionists say,
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; some chaotic thing happened, chemicals
[1:43:23] mixed and this happened and this grew
[1:43:25] out of that and that spawned this and
[1:43:27] this happened there and this, you know,
[1:43:29] it was just chaos
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; that produced this.
[1:43:35] But man is not the accident of chaos.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; He's the result of order.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; And so is God's bride in the end time.
[1:43:45] Somebody with me now.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's right in the end times. She
[1:43:49] is no accident.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; I don't know. YOU KNOW, I'M FOURTH IN MY
[1:43:56] FAMILY AND I don't know my my my PARENTS
[1:43:59] MAY NOT HAVE PLANNED ME TO come
[1:44:04] after so many. You quit planning.
[1:44:08] You plan to have children. One, two.
[1:44:12] I'm number four. Maybe I wasn't planned,
[1:44:15] but I'm not an accident.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; They may not have planned me,
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; but God planned me.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; AND I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR BIRTH
[1:44:29] CIRCUMSTANCES ARE.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I DON'T CARE EVEN THE SIN AND THE
[1:44:36] CHAOS THAT YOU CAME OUT OF.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE GOD IS A GOD WHO
[1:44:43] WILL LOOK RIGHT DOWN IN CHAOS AND BRING
[1:44:46] ORDER OUT OF IT.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; AND HE KNOWS HOW TO FIND EVERY
[1:44:53] PREDESTINATED SEA, EVEN IF THEY GET AS
[1:44:55] MESSED UP AS THE WOMAN AT THE WELL WAS.
[1:45:01] Because Satan would do everything he
[1:45:03] could to bring such DARKNESS UPON HER
[1:45:06] LIFE AND FILE SIN UPON SIN UPON SIN AND
[1:45:10] EVEN RELIGIOUS UNBELIEF UPON HER LIFE
[1:45:12] AND BRING HER LIFE INTO SUCH CHAOS THAT
[1:45:15] SURELY GOD WOULD NEVER FIND HER. BUT HE
[1:45:18] HAD NEED A DIVINE APPOINTMENT
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; TO GO BY HER WAY.
[1:45:24] And I'll tell you, he's no less that God
[1:45:26] today who will go out of his way to find
[1:45:29] you, to deliver you, to save you, TO
[1:45:32] SANCTIFY YOU, TO HEAL YOU, TO PUT YOU IN
[1:45:34] ORDER AROUND HIMSELF
[1:45:38] BECAUSE SHE'S A GOD THAT BRINGS order
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; and his bride in the end time, she is no
[1:45:48] accident.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; God has been building
[1:45:53] for seven church ages
[1:45:56] until he will have a bride who he says
[1:46:00] will be complete entire lacking nothing.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; And she will be in his very image,
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh.
[1:46:14] She will be him reproduced in bright
[1:46:18] form.
[1:46:25] God
[1:46:27] formed man deliberately.
[1:46:33] And when he did,
[1:46:35] he did something he did not do for any
[1:46:37] other creature.
[1:46:40] Genesis 2:7,
[1:46:43] he breathed
[1:46:45] into his nostrils
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; the breath of life. And man became a
[1:46:52] living soul.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HERE WAS GOD NOW BRINGING HERE THE
[1:47:01] THE THE EDEX THE TOP THE CAPSTONE OF HIS
[1:47:06] CREATION.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS NOT COMPLETE THOUGH IT WAS IN
[1:47:11] HIS LIKENESS. SO HIS FORM IN HIS IMAGE
[1:47:14] IT WAS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL HE BREATHED.
[1:47:18] AMEN.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAME INTO
[1:47:24] ADAM, HE BECAME A LIVING SOUL.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; You see, life reached its highest
[1:47:30] expression when God shared his own
[1:47:33] breath with it,
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; his own life.
[1:47:40] And that's what God has done.
[1:47:44] And I want you to understand,
[1:47:47] it is not enough to be formed
[1:47:50] into the likeness
[1:47:53] of an orderly church
[1:47:56] and be lifeless.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Tim, God has sent a message in
[1:48:07] this day and has formed a people in his
[1:48:08] image. It's got to do more than just
[1:48:12] produce a likeness of orderly.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; It's got to be God breathed.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Do you know that's why after all of
[1:48:22] these ages the token comes the literal
[1:48:25] life of Jesus Christ. Not a jump, not a
[1:48:28] shout, not a justification, not a
[1:48:30] sanctification, but the very person of
[1:48:32] Christ,
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; his breath.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; His own life.
[1:48:38] ENTERED INTO A BODY.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; NOW, so once again, as the pattern
[1:48:45] continu continues, life has reached his
[1:48:48] highest expression AS GOD IS SHARING HIS
[1:48:51] OWN BREATH, HIS OWN LIFE, AND THE HOLY
[1:48:54] GHOST IS BREATHING LIFE INTO A BRIDE.
[1:48:57] AND SHE'S BECOMING ALIVE WITH HIS POWER
[1:48:59] AS A PEOPLE TO DO WHAT? TO MANIFEST his
[1:49:03] life.
[1:49:06] And this
[1:49:09] this principle is God's eternal one
[1:49:13] where the spirit of God moves.
[1:49:16] And when he moves, the word speaks. And
[1:49:19] when the word speaks, light appears.
[1:49:22] And when light appears, life follows.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; And God brought order out of chaos then.
[1:49:30] And he still does it today.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. Amen.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; And and I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT NO
[1:49:36] MATTER HOW HOW MUCH TROUBLE THAT WE GET
[1:49:39] IN, NO MATTER HOW FAR WE GO ALONG, no
[1:49:41] matter HOW STILL things seem to be or
[1:49:44] how how out OF ORDER OR CHAOTIC THINGS
[1:49:48] BE, God has not left his purpose.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; He will have a people in his image
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; who he will share his own life with.
[1:49:59] And God brought order out of chaos then
[1:50:02] and HE STILL DOES TODAY.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; WHETHER IN CREATION, WHETHER IN the
[1:50:07] church, whether in a human heart, WHEN
[1:50:10] GOD SPEAKS, DARKNESS MUST RETREAT.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; CONFUSION MUST YIELD AND LIGHT MUST
[1:50:17] RISE.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THIS IS THE POWER OF THE WORD.
[1:50:20] THIS IS THE NATURE OF GOD. HE IS STILL
[1:50:23] THE ONE WHO STEPS INTO THE VOID,
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; who says, "Let there be." Oh, brother.
[1:50:29] Amen. I I pray today is a divine
[1:50:32] appointment for many in this building
[1:50:34] today
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; and where you can have an encounter with
[1:50:37] God where the spirit of God moves.
[1:50:41] And as he moves, amen, into your chaos
[1:50:46] and he speaks a word AND THAT WORD
[1:50:48] BRINGS A LIGHT
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; INTO YOUR LIFE AND DISPELS THE DARKNESS
[1:50:53] AND SATAN flees
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; and victories are won
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; and healing begins
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; and restoration BEGINS
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; UNTIL YOU FINALLY COME TO THAT COVETED
[1:51:05] PLACE WHERE YOU REACH THE APEX OF PEOPLE
[1:51:07] IN HIS IMAGE FILLED WITH HIS BREATH.
[1:51:11] his breath so you can speak
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; as he speaks.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; This is what God did by sending a
[1:51:24] message.
[1:51:25] He stepped into the void into the
[1:51:28] emptiness of churchity
[1:51:31] and to religion and he brought a word
[1:51:34] and that word brought illumination.
[1:51:37] For when the word speaks, it says, "Let
[1:51:39] there be light."
[1:51:42] And we a people who sat in darkness saw
[1:51:45] a great light. And that light brought
[1:51:48] truth that lay in obscurity
[1:51:52] into revelation.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Let's look here in second Peter 1:19.
[1:51:58] As you turn there with me just for a
[1:52:00] moment,
[1:52:04] we also have a more sure word of
[1:52:07] prophecy.
[1:52:09] And and I I think about that after
[1:52:12] divine vindication
[1:52:15] after God PROVEN IT OVER AND OVER and
[1:52:18] over of the validity of this message and
[1:52:21] his messenger.
[1:52:23] WE ALSO HAVE A MORE sure
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; word of prophecy.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where to you do well that you take
[1:52:33] heed. In other words, it do you well to
[1:52:36] listen to it
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; AS UNTIL LIGHT THAT SHINETH IN A DARK
[1:52:40] PLACE UNTIL THE DAY DAWN AND THE DAY
[1:52:44] STAR arise in your heart.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you this is what happens
[1:52:49] when salvation come. That day when the
[1:52:51] woman at the well met the s so of God.
[1:52:55] Amen. That light sprung right down into
[1:52:57] her soul. It was a light shining in a
[1:53:00] dark place.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; And it brought the dawning of a new day
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; and the because the day star that's the
[1:53:08] sun rose in her heart.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; And when he rises in her heart,
[1:53:17] it never sets.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. IT NEVER GOES BACK
[1:53:27] INTO DARKNESS.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE ARISES IN YOUR HEART AND HE
[1:53:32] QUICKENS THAT SEED ON THE INSIDE, IT'LL
[1:53:35] NEVER RETREAT BACK INTO DARKNESS AGAIN.
[1:53:38] IT'S SEALED into the day of redemption.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now know this first."
[1:53:46] So I guess get something a knowledge we
[1:53:49] get first
[1:53:51] that no prophecy of the scripture is a
[1:53:54] private interpretation
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; that excludes every theologian
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; that puts out every one of the 40 40,000
[1:54:04] denominational systems there is
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; no scripture no prophecy of the
[1:54:11] scripture
[1:54:12] is subject to their own interpretation.
[1:54:16] It's not for them to interpret.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Theologians can't figure it out.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; KNOW THIS FIRST.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURE IS NOT SUBJECT TO
[1:54:32] TEACHERS.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; And men who want to twist it, make it
[1:54:38] the way they want it to be.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:54:42] Now, it's not subject to private
[1:54:45] interpretation.
[1:54:47] It's not even subject to my
[1:54:49] interpretation
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; or yours.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't think it means that. I
[1:54:58] don't know who you are,
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; but I has certainly become a very big
[1:55:02] person.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; And when you look at the word sin, I is
[1:55:09] in the center of it.
[1:55:12] BUT IF YOU'LL EVER GET BORN again
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; and change that to an O, then the son
[1:55:17] will be
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; the center.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; When you BECOME NOTHING, WHAT YOU THINK,
[1:55:24] WHAT YOU ah what I THINK FOR WHAT I WANT
[1:55:27] FOR MY LIFE, WHAT I DESIRE, I'll tell
[1:55:29] you what,
[1:55:30] that leads to sin.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, it does.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Because it's I.
[1:55:36] You see, WE'VE GOT A WORLD TODAY THAT IS
[1:55:39] FILLED WITH EYE DISEASE.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; I I will I will exalt. I will do I will
[1:55:45] have my own way. I will do what I want.
[1:55:48] I It's all about me. It's I I I I
[1:55:58] disease.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Many people's got it.
[1:56:05] And you got to come to where your
[1:56:07] thoughts mean zero
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; because your thoughts are not his
[1:56:11] thoughts
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; and your ways are not his ways.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; His word is his thoughts.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; And it's not subject to private
[1:56:21] interpretation.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach now.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; So now eye disease. Yeah. It reminds me
[1:56:31] of a story
[1:56:33] My father-in-law told me, oh, brother
[1:56:35] Buts, many years ago, he told me a
[1:56:37] story. He said, of um about there was
[1:56:42] a couple of ducks or geese in a pond up
[1:56:45] north.
[1:56:48] And
[1:56:51] the geese looked over at one another.
[1:56:52] So, well, boy, it's getting cold.
[1:56:54] There's ice forming on the pond. We got
[1:56:56] to leave from here. We'll freeze here.
[1:56:59] There's an old turtle stuck his head up
[1:57:00] and said, "What about me?
[1:57:03] Leave me here. I'll die."
[1:57:06] So, well, I'm sorry. You don't have
[1:57:07] wings. You can't go. So, well, I'll tell
[1:57:10] you what I what you do. You grab you a
[1:57:12] stick. I'll grab a stick. I'll hold on
[1:57:14] to it in the middle.
[1:57:17] You just get a hold of it on either
[1:57:18] side.
[1:57:22] Pick me up and take me with you. And
[1:57:24] I'll enjoy the sunny south.
[1:57:27] I'll live, not die.
[1:57:30] Well, that's a clever idea.
[1:57:33] So, they got a So, they got a stick.
[1:57:36] Turtle got his mouth, held on to it.
[1:57:39] Geese took on each side. They got way up
[1:57:42] high, maybe mile or so high.
[1:57:46] After they got up high, YOU KNOW, THERE
[1:57:48] WAS ANOTHER FLOCK OF GEESE COME FLYING
[1:57:49] BY AND SAID, "HEY,
[1:57:52] THAT'S A CLEVER IDEA THERE. WHO THOUGHT
[1:57:54] about who thought of that?" And the
[1:57:56] turtle said, "Ah,
[1:57:58] dear."
[1:58:02] You see, it's so much
[1:58:05] for about me.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; I
[1:58:09] But when you change that three-letter
[1:58:12] word of sin
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; and you become nothing, then you become
[1:58:16] a son or daughter of God.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; SO KNOW THIS VERSE. NO SCRIPTURE IS A
[1:58:23] PRIVATE INTERPRETATION.
[1:58:26] So no prophecy, no scripture is a
[1:58:28] private interpretation. NO THEOLOGIAN,
[1:58:31] NO DOCTOR, divinity has a right to
[1:58:32] interpret. INTERPRETATION BELONGS TO GOD
[1:58:36] ALONE.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would preach a sermon.
[1:58:41] God is his own interpreter.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; And of course, let me tell you how that
[1:58:48] comes. Verse 21. And the prophecy came
[1:58:53] not in all time by the will of man in a
[1:58:57] synagogue by the rabbis.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; BY THEOLOGIANS FIGURING IT OUT.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; COME ON. THAT'S NOT HOW IT CAME. THE
[1:59:08] PROPHECY DID NOT COME IN OLD TIME BY THE
[1:59:10] WILL OF MAN, BUT HOLY MEN OF GOD SPAKE
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; AS THEY WERE MOVED BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:59:21] That's why we believe in prophetic
[1:59:22] revelation
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; instead of seminary.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Now as we look at this, Eden was a place
[1:59:32] of perfect divine order. It was a
[1:59:34] creation exactly as God intended.
[1:59:37] Life was in harmony, authority rightly
[1:59:40] placed. Peace was governing every
[1:59:43] relationship. There was no fear. There
[1:59:44] was no violence. There was no death. And
[1:59:48] God said, saw of everything that he
[1:59:50] made, and behold, it was very good.
[1:59:54] And in that ordered world, creation
[1:59:57] lived without fear, without without
[2:00:00] hostility.
[2:00:02] It was actually no fear. The lion would
[2:00:04] lay down by the lamb.
[2:00:07] You know, Isaiah would gave a prophetic
[2:00:09] picture of that original harmony. He
[2:00:12] said, "The lion shall eat straw like the
[2:00:14] bullock."
[2:00:16] and and Eden Eden reflected God's
[2:00:21] nature. It was peaceful. It was
[2:00:23] balanced.
[2:00:24] It was lifegiven.
[2:00:27] But Satan,
[2:00:29] the one WHO HAD ALREADY BROKEN GOD'S
[2:00:32] ORDER in heaven, came to earth with the
[2:00:35] same agenda.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that he came as
[2:00:40] an angel of light.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; And this is the way he ALWAYS COMES. HE
[2:00:46] DIDN'T COME WITH VIOLENCE,
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; you know. He He DIDN'T COME WITH GUNS
[2:00:51] BLAZING AND CANNONS and and conquering
[2:00:54] Eden. That's not the way he did it. He
[2:00:56] entered in with deception.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; He questioned God's word. He challenged
[2:01:04] God's leadership, his headship,
[2:01:08] and he offered an al alternate order.
[2:01:15] one that was centered on himself and
[2:01:18] said, "Yay,
[2:01:20] had God said?"
[2:01:23] And the moment God's word was doubted,
[2:01:26] that's when order begin to collapse.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what happens.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; That's why many people fall so short of
[2:01:37] salvation.
[2:01:40] Somewhere along the line, they quit
[2:01:42] believing and start doubting.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO THROUGH DECEPTION, Edom was
[2:01:49] turned into chaos and sinner sin entered
[2:01:52] and fellowship was broken AND DEATH
[2:01:54] FOLLOWED AND AND THE BIBLE SAID BY ONE
[2:01:57] MAN sin entered into THE WORLD AND DEATH
[2:02:00] BY SIN.
[2:02:02] SO WHAT BEGAN IN harmony became
[2:02:06] conflict. AND WHAT WAS PEACE NOW BECAME
[2:02:10] FEAR. And man now hid from God. And and
[2:02:14] and it caused all creation to groan.
[2:02:16] BECAUSE WHEN MAN THE HEAD OF THE EARTH
[2:02:18] FELL, the earth fell with it. Everything
[2:02:21] beneath him.
[2:02:24] And then we will have one of the first
[2:02:27] visible fruits of that disorder appears
[2:02:31] in the next generation
[2:02:33] when Cain killed Abel.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Now in the beginning
[2:02:41] there was there in the heavens
[2:02:43] everything moved in perfect order and
[2:02:45] harmony with God. Nothing was out of
[2:02:48] alignment. It functioned in absolute
[2:02:50] continuity with the creator. God said
[2:02:53] saw everything that was good that he had
[2:02:56] made and and it was very good. The
[2:02:59] stars, the galaxies, the solar systems,
[2:03:04] they all continue the same divine order
[2:03:06] today.
[2:03:08] For the scripture said he holdeth all
[2:03:10] things up by the word of his power. And
[2:03:13] we know that if one heavenly body moved
[2:03:17] out of its ordained place, IT WOULD
[2:03:20] DISRUPT THE ENTIRE PROGRAM.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; One interruption would despoil the whole
[2:03:27] order. And the same principle applied on
[2:03:30] the earth. As long as man lived in
[2:03:32] continuity with God, one man and one
[2:03:35] woman UNDER GOD'S WORD, LIFE FLOWED
[2:03:38] UNHINDERED.
[2:03:40] BUT WHEN EVE STEPPED OUTSIDE THE
[2:03:42] BOUNDARY OF GOD'S WORD, THE CONTINUITY
[2:03:44] WAS broken and the scripture plainly
[2:03:46] recorded it SAYS YAY HATH GOD SAID. SO
[2:03:50] ONE WORD WAS QUESTIONED AND ONE
[2:03:53] alteration accepted AND THE ENTIRE
[2:03:56] PROGRAM OF GOD FELL OUT OF ALIGNMENT
[2:03:59] WITH GOD.
[2:04:01] AND THAT'S WHY THE SCRIPTURE,
[2:04:04] you know, it it presents the word in
[2:04:06] such an uncompromising way to add to it
[2:04:10] or take from it. It's never harmless.
[2:04:15] The Bible SAID, "YOU SHALL NOT ADD UNTO
[2:04:17] THE WORD which I COMMAND YOU OR DIMINISH
[2:04:20] OFF FROM IT." YOU GOT TO STAY RIGHT WITH
[2:04:23] THAT WORD.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU CAN'T DIMINISH FROM IT. THE
[2:04:27] MOMENT ONE word was rejected,
[2:04:32] let me JUST SAY IT. THE MOMENT ONE word
[2:04:35] is rejected,
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; a person, a family or church is thrown
[2:04:42] out of comm continuity with God
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; because Jesus made it clear that the
[2:04:47] only way we live is by every word that
[2:04:50] proceeds out of the mouth of God.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; That's where life is. Life is not
[2:04:56] outside of the word.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; And when you leave the word, you leave
[2:05:01] God.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; And when you leave God, you step into
[2:05:05] disorder into chaos and you bring all
[2:05:08] kinds of sin into your life.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Now, the separation in Eden didn't
[2:05:15] start. It did not come from angels or
[2:05:18] creation or from Adam initially, but
[2:05:20] from Eve stepping beyond God's word. The
[2:05:24] Bible said the woman being deceived was
[2:05:27] in the transgression and the issue was
[2:05:31] deception and and disobedience.
[2:05:34] AND SO GOD'S ORDER ALWAYS BEGINS with
[2:05:38] him first.
[2:05:40] A covenant comes with God first BEFORE
[2:05:46] COVENANT WITH OTHERS.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; I want you to get this. Now this is a
[2:05:52] very important principle. You see God's
[2:05:55] order always begins with him first.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; A covenant with God comes before any
[2:06:03] covenant with others.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; That's why a covenant order is always
[2:06:11] vertical before it is horizontal.
[2:06:17] Every true covenant begins with a right
[2:06:20] relationship with God.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; And only then does it produce right
[2:06:27] relationships with people.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; So if you want I if you want uh real
[2:06:38] order in your home, IT STARTS WITH GOD
[2:06:41] FIRST.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:06:45] THAT THAT'S WHY LISTEN there should
[2:06:47] never be divorces in message churches
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; is absolutely should never be
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; and the reason that it happens is
[2:07:00] because men seek their own will rather
[2:07:02] than God's will.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach now.
[2:07:09] Now you know we we understand this is
[2:07:12] what this is the root of the problem
[2:07:15] because at the beginning it wasn't so
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; God ordered one man and one one woman.
[2:07:23] He never ordered marriage and divorce
[2:07:25] and remarage.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach.
[2:07:30] So the but it always comes because
[2:07:35] the the order with the heavens was not
[2:07:39] WAS NOT MADE FIRST. THE COVENANTS GOT TO
[2:07:41] BE MADE WITH GOD FIRST. THAT'S WHY YOU
[2:07:44] DO NOT WANT TO TAKE A MATE without the
[2:07:47] Holy Ghost.
[2:07:51] A GIRL THAT WOULD TAKE A BOY THAT
[2:07:53] DOESN'T HAVE THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN HIM IS
[2:07:56] RECEIVING another headship
[2:07:58] than Christ.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE CHRIST IS THE HEAD OF THE MAN.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; And the same way the woman reflects who
[2:08:08] the man is. SO THE DESIRE, the real
[2:08:11] spirituality of a man is shown in who he
[2:08:14] chooses. SO, A COVENANT BEGINS
[2:08:17] VERTICALLY first before it does
[2:08:19] horizontally.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; And and the Bible makes this plain. He
[2:08:26] says, "Love the Lord thy God with all
[2:08:28] thy heart
[2:08:30] and with thy neighbor as thyself."
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Do you notice God first, not second?
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Love your neighbor first
[2:08:38] and love God next."
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "Get it right with God first,
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; then you'll love your neighbor." Amen.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; And if a love gets right
[2:08:51] in a person's life with God,
[2:08:55] it'll it'll bring it'll bring order in a
[2:08:58] life. IT'LL CAUSE YOU TO CHOOSE THINGS
[2:09:00] OF GOD'S ORDER THAT WON'T BRING CHAOS,
[2:09:03] that won't bring sin. AND THAT'S WHY A
[2:09:06] MARRIAGE COVENANT MUST begin vert
[2:09:09] vertically WITH BOTH HUSBAND AND WIFE
[2:09:12] SUBMITTED TO GOD BEFORE IT CAN EVER
[2:09:15] SUCCEED HORIZONTALLY. BECAUSE THE BIBLE
[2:09:18] SAID, "EXCEPT THE LORD BUILD THE HOUSE,
[2:09:21] THEY labor in vain that build it."
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:28] So if you want a house, you want a house
[2:09:30] God built,
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; not one you built
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; because it's going to be built on
[2:09:35] shifting sands. When you get it built on
[2:09:38] God, the rock,
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; then it'll weather the storms that are
[2:09:42] coming in life because there's plenty of
[2:09:45] chaos that is coming.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, love between TWO
[2:09:49] PEOPLE CANNOT STAND LONG WITHOUT THE
[2:09:51] REVERENCE for God above them. You
[2:09:54] reverence him first.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:57] And the same principle it applies to
[2:09:59] friendships,
[2:10:00] to families, TO BUSINESS DEALINGS.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; FOR THE BIBLE SAID, "IN ALL THY WAYS
[2:10:06] ACKNOWLEDGE HIM."
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; So every covenant that endures must
[2:10:12] begin with God at the center.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; God number one.
[2:10:19] And that's it. Look at our nation. Look
[2:10:22] at our nation. The nation of America. It
[2:10:24] wants new order.
[2:10:26] and bless him. Look at the chaos in our
[2:10:29] streets.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Look at the chaos in our news.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Look at the opposition, the lawlessness,
[2:10:36] the spirit of lawlessness
[2:10:38] that is in our world today.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; The It's chaos.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you know that
[2:10:50] THIS NATION ONCE KNEW ORDER and
[2:10:53] blessing. It was founded at least in
[2:10:55] principle with acknowledgments of God.
[2:10:58] And the Bible said, "Blessed is the
[2:11:00] nation whose God is the Lord."
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; But as
[2:11:07] the vertical relationship has been
[2:11:09] forsaken,
[2:11:11] order has rapidly given away to chaos.
[2:11:14] And when a people lose their covenant
[2:11:16] with God, their agreements with one
[2:11:18] another lose meaning.
[2:11:23] And the scripture warns the wicked shall
[2:11:25] be turned into hell and all the nations
[2:11:27] that forget God
[2:11:29] because when the vertical covenant is
[2:11:32] broken, the horizontal cannot hold. And
[2:11:35] when EVE DISOBEYED GOD'S WORD, SHE BROKE
[2:11:38] HER RELATIONSHIP with God.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; AND SHE STEPPED OUTSIDE OF WHAT GOD HAS
[2:11:44] SPOKEN. AND ONCE THE VERTICAL
[2:11:46] RELATIONSHIP WAS BROKEN, EVERYTHING
[2:11:48] CONNECTED TO IT WAS AFFECTED. HER
[2:11:51] RELATIONSHIP WITH ADAM DIDN'T FALL
[2:11:53] FIRST. IT FELL APART BECAUSE HER
[2:11:56] RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD WAS ALREADY
[2:11:59] BROKEN.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THE BIBLE SHOWS THIS
[2:12:03] PRINCIPLE. IT VERY clearly said, you
[2:12:05] know, he said, God said, "Thou shalt not
[2:12:07] eat of it." In other words, partake of
[2:12:10] it. And when that word was violated,
[2:12:14] fellowship with God was immediately
[2:12:15] lost.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; And they, what happened then? They hid
[2:12:19] themselves.
[2:12:21] And only then and only and then after
[2:12:24] that brought shame and blame and
[2:12:26] division and it entered their home and
[2:12:28] the breakdown with each other from
[2:12:30] followed the breakdown with with God and
[2:12:33] the next thing you know there's murder
[2:12:34] in their home. There's division in their
[2:12:36] home. There's a a son that is out of the
[2:12:39] presence of God
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; into the land of wandering.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THE CONNECTION WITH GOD WAS
[2:12:48] LOST.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; So to make this as simple as I know how,
[2:12:55] WHEN YOU STOP LISTENING TO GOD, YOU
[2:12:58] CAN'T STAY RIGHT WITH OTHERS.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD'S WORD IS BROKEN, THEN HUMAN
[2:13:04] RELATIONSHIPS SUFFER NEXT. AND THAT'S
[2:13:07] WHERE MARRIAGES would deteriorate.
[2:13:09] THAT'S WHERE CHURCHES FALL APART.
[2:13:12] AND THAT'S WHY GOD ALWAYS DEALS WITH THE
[2:13:15] HEART UPWARD BEFORE HE DEALS WITH THE
[2:13:17] LIFE OUTWARD BECAUSE HE SAID, "SEEK
[2:13:19] FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND ITS
[2:13:21] RIGHTEOUSNESS
[2:13:22] and then all things else will be added
[2:13:25] to you."
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Tim, you don't know how
[2:13:27] bad I want a wife. Seek God.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; You don't know how bad I want a husband.
[2:13:32] I need a boyfriend. Brother Tim, I seek
[2:13:35] God.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he becomes preeminent in your
[2:13:39] life, only then are you fit for a mate.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you will choose chaos.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Sin brings chaos. It brings hurt. It
[2:13:51] brings disease. It brings It brings
[2:13:54] sorrow. It brings shame. It brings hurt.
[2:13:58] It brings broken relationships.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; SO ORDER ALWAYS FLOWS FROM THE TOP DOWN.
[2:14:06] SO THE PROBLEM AT EDEN WAS NOT FIRST a
[2:14:08] marriage problem. IT WAS A WORD PROBLEM.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; EVERY PROBLEM THAT FOLLOWED CAME FROM
[2:14:15] THAT ONE PLACE. WHEN THE VERTICAL LINE
[2:14:18] TO GOD WAS BROKEN, THE HORIZONTAL LINE
[2:14:20] TO OTHERS COLLAPSED. AND THAT same
[2:14:23] principle applies today. You break the
[2:14:25] word, you break fellowship with God. You
[2:14:27] break fellowship with God, you have
[2:14:29] disorder in your home, disorder in your
[2:14:31] church, disorder in your family.
[2:14:33] Disorder comes everywhere. chaos.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY THAT I SAY MOST marriages
[2:14:40] can and most marriage problems can be
[2:14:42] fixed with a good dose of the Holy
[2:14:45] Ghost.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; What you need is not an intellectual
[2:14:50] talk.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; OR A PSYCHOLOGIST TO GIVE YOU SOME
[2:14:54] IDEAS. WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS GET A
[2:14:57] RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD AND THE HOLY GHOST
[2:15:00] AND THE LOVE OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE AND
[2:15:02] IT'LL FIX EVERY PROBLEM IN YOUR
[2:15:03] MARRIAGE.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:15:09] And that's the way to avoid marriage
[2:15:11] problems
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; is to be filled with the spirit.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Because when we're walking in the
[2:15:18] spirit, man and woman, there's harmony.
[2:15:20] Yes.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; So you stay aligned with God's word and
[2:15:24] everything beneath it stays in order.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus referred back to this very
[2:15:30] moment when he said from the beginning
[2:15:31] it was not so. He reminded us God's
[2:15:34] original design was one man one woman
[2:15:36] united under divine order.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; When that order was violated death
[2:15:42] entered
[2:15:44] by one man sinner to the world and death
[2:15:46] by sin. The continuity was shattered.
[2:15:49] And that same principle applies today
[2:15:51] when men gather and decide, "Well, it
[2:15:53] don't mean that." They're just repeating
[2:15:56] the same haunting voice, satanic serpent
[2:16:00] voice that whispered in Eden.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Paul warned this of this thing. He said,
[2:16:05] "Let God be true and every man's word be
[2:16:08] a lie."
[2:16:10] When God's word is adjusted to fit your
[2:16:13] human reasoning,
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; then your lifeline is broken
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; and the result will be confusion. It'll
[2:16:20] be powerless religion. It'll be
[2:16:23] ILLEGITIMATE SPIRITUAL OFFSPRING, CHURCH
[2:16:25] MEMBERS BORN OF A SYSTEM RATHER THAN THE
[2:16:29] WORD. ONCE THE CONTINUITY IS BROKEN,
[2:16:32] EVERYTHING FRA FRACTURES. YOU KNOW, THE
[2:16:34] LIFELINE, THE TIMELINE, the covenant,
[2:16:36] the flow of life. AND WHAT CAUSED IT?
[2:16:39] STEPPING OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARY OF THE
[2:16:41] GOD'S WORD. And that was the original
[2:16:43] breach in Eden. And it remains THE ROOT
[2:16:46] OF EVERY BREAKDOWN SENSE that God's
[2:16:48] order has never failed. Man's
[2:16:50] relationship to the word has.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; So you stay in continuity with the word
[2:16:55] and then life flows.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; So what happened when they didn't follow
[2:17:00] it?
[2:17:03] Chaos. Order turned to chaos.
[2:17:06] Cain rose up and killed his brother
[2:17:08] Abel.
[2:17:10] Murder was not just a crime.
[2:17:14] It was a evidence that God's order had
[2:17:16] been abandoned.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; Cain was of that wicked one.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Chaos always reproduces after its kind.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know how you can expect anything
[2:17:28] else.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Sin produces sin.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; Sin in the home produces sin in the
[2:17:33] children.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:38] And it con IT CONTINUES FALLING RIGHT
[2:17:41] DOWN, YOU KNOW, THROUGH generations
[2:17:44] because what YOU DO TODAY DON'T JUST
[2:17:46] AFFECT YOU. It's going to affect YOUR
[2:17:47] CHILDREN. IT'S GOING TO AFFECT YOUR
[2:17:49] GRANDCHILDREN. IT'LL AFFECT YOUR great
[2:17:51] grandchildren.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; IT'LL SET PATTERNS IN THE HOME, IN THE
[2:17:56] FAMILY.
[2:17:57] THAT'S WHY YOU WANT YOUR FOCUS ON GOD
[2:18:00] NUMBER ONE.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Because again CHAOS ALWAYS red
[2:18:08] reproduces after its kind. CHAOS NEVER
[2:18:11] PRODUCES SONS. IT PRODUCES SEED OF THE
[2:18:13] serpent offspring
[2:18:16] of Satan.
[2:18:18] Once God's order is rejected, violence,
[2:18:22] corruption, wickedness would multiply
[2:18:25] rapidly.
[2:18:27] Soon the world became so corrupted
[2:18:31] from that one sin.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; The whole world became so corrupted
[2:18:37] until God himself testified the earth
[2:18:41] also was corrupt before God and the
[2:18:44] earth was filled with violence.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; That's Genesis 6:11.
[2:18:49] And the thoughts of men were on evil
[2:18:52] continually. Genesis 6:5.
[2:18:56] This order had reached such a depth
[2:19:00] that in order to preserve his purpose to
[2:19:03] get it the world back on track,
[2:19:07] God had to act decisively
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; and he washed the earth with water. And
[2:19:16] he says, "I
[2:19:18] even I DO BRING A FLOOD OF WATERS ON THE
[2:19:21] EARTH TO DESTROY ALL FLESH."
[2:19:24] And the and THE FLOOD WAS MORE THAN
[2:19:26] PUNISHMENT. IT WAS CORRECTION.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS CORRECTING THE DISORDER.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; IT WAS JUDGMENT YET BUT IT WAS JUDGMENT
[2:19:35] WITH REDEMPTION IN MIND. I want you to
[2:19:37] get this. A lot OF TIMES WHEN JUDGMENT
[2:19:40] COMES, IT IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF
[2:19:42] REDEMPTION.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME?
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD PRESERVED NOAH IN THAT TIME.
[2:19:48] GOD HAD SOMEBODY IN THE MIDST of chaos.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. A MAN WHO FOUND GRACE IN THE EYES
[2:19:56] OF THE LORD. OH, I want to be that
[2:19:58] PERSON TODAY.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; IN ALL THE CHAOS IN THE WORLD THAT IT
[2:20:02] CAN BE SAID OF ME, Noah found grace
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; in the sight of the Lord.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And through him, God reset the
[2:20:11] earth and chaos was restrained. So God's
[2:20:15] plan could continue.
[2:20:17] So here the pattern continues and it
[2:20:20] never changes. God creates order. Satan
[2:20:23] introduces deception. Chaos follows the
[2:20:27] rebellion. God intervenes to restore
[2:20:29] order. And this is what's always
[2:20:32] happened. From the flood, from Eden to
[2:20:35] the flood, even to today God's word will
[2:20:38] be rejected. Chaos follows. But whenever
[2:20:41] God speaks again and the spirit of God
[2:20:44] moves and life begins to spring again,
[2:20:47] order is restored because he's a God who
[2:20:50] brings harmony out of disorder
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; and light out of darkness.
[2:20:56] Now, it wasn't long after the flood
[2:20:59] that God after God had washed the earth
[2:21:03] to restore order
[2:21:05] that rebellion rose again.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; I want you to see something. There is a
[2:21:10] cycle that comes on with generations.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; The first order, THE FIRST GENERATION
[2:21:18] WILL WALK WITH GOD. THE NEXT generation
[2:21:20] will
[2:21:23] not have the same desire, the same
[2:21:27] vision, the same purpose.
[2:21:32] And so he was not long after Noah
[2:21:36] that the Bible said and Kush
[2:21:38] begat Nimrod and he began to be a mighty
[2:21:42] one in the earth and he was a mighty one
[2:21:44] before the Lord and he wasn't just
[2:21:46] merely hunting animals. It is it speaks
[2:21:49] of conquest, domination,
[2:21:51] self-exaltation. Nimrod, he rose as a
[2:21:55] RULER WHO EXALTED HIMSELF ABOVE OTHERS.
[2:21:58] HE GATHERED MEN UNDER his authority. HE
[2:22:00] STARTED BUILDING A KINGDOM centered on
[2:22:02] human power rather than divine
[2:22:04] submission.
[2:22:06] AND HE ESTABLISHED A KINGDOM THERE in
[2:22:09] Babel. And there men conceived a plan
[2:22:13] that revealed the true condition of
[2:22:15] their hearts. They say in Genesis 11:4,
[2:22:18] "And they said, go to let us build a
[2:22:21] city and a tower whose top may reach
[2:22:24] unto heaven, and let us make us a name.
[2:22:31] Now
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO WATCH THE SAME ambition
[2:22:35] that Satan had.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; GOD HAD WASHED THE EARTH. HE HAD HE
[2:22:41] BECAUSE OF THE CHAOS, HE HAD NOW BROUGHT
[2:22:44] IT BACK TO COMPLETE pristine condition.
[2:22:48] But it isn't long until man began to
[2:22:52] work with deception.
[2:22:55] And man begins to build a tower. And
[2:22:58] this tower of Babel is a representation
[2:23:01] of every denomination today. It is a
[2:23:04] tower that men made
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; because the word of God is the name of
[2:23:09] God and the name of the Lord is a mighty
[2:23:11] tower that the righteous run into and
[2:23:13] are saved.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; But the towers that men build, here's
[2:23:18] the deal. They built a tower THAT WOULD
[2:23:21] BE HIGHER THAN the judgment waters of
[2:23:24] the flood.
[2:23:26] SO THAT WHEN SO THAT WHEN JUDGMENT COME
[2:23:29] AGAIN, they can live any way they wanted
[2:23:32] to and run up in their tower
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; and be safe.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; This is the goal of every denominational
[2:23:44] system. Yeah.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; They built a tower of religion
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; that you that will be there and out of
[2:23:54] reach of God's judgment where you can
[2:23:56] live any way you want to and when
[2:23:58] judgment comes run up into the tower.
[2:24:03] But it won't work
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; because this tower was not just
[2:24:11] architecture. It just wasn't just a
[2:24:16] an Eiffel Tower and piece of architect.
[2:24:19] It was defiance.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; It was in your face, God. It was man
[2:24:24] saying, "We will live how we choose. And
[2:24:27] if God chooses to judge it, we will rise
[2:24:31] above it." And the tower represent
[2:24:34] confidence in human systems and human
[2:24:36] unity and human security apart from God.
[2:24:39] AND THE BIBLE SAID THEY ALL SPOKE ONE
[2:24:41] LANGUAGE, but that didn't mean they were
[2:24:43] in divine order.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; Without submission to God,
[2:24:48] that's not unity. That's not order. Is
[2:24:51] organized rebellion.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; And this exaltation of sin again
[2:24:55] produced chaos upon the earth that had
[2:24:58] already been redeemed by water. And God
[2:25:01] looked down and said, "This they begin
[2:25:03] to do,
[2:25:05] and nothing will be restrained from them
[2:25:08] which they have imagined to do." And
[2:25:11] when man is united against God,
[2:25:13] destruction is inevitable. So God
[2:25:15] intervened,
[2:25:16] not to destroy, but to restrain chaos.
[2:25:21] And he said, "Go down. Let us confound
[2:25:24] our language that they not understand
[2:25:25] one another's speech." Now, I want you
[2:25:28] to listen. What looked like disorder,
[2:25:31] confusion of tongues
[2:25:35] was actually God restoring order
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; by dividing their language. He stopped
[2:25:40] the spread of rebellion.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; He preserved his redemptive plan. The
[2:25:45] Bible said, "Therefore is the name of it
[2:25:47] called Babel because the Lord did dare
[2:25:50] confound the language of all the earth."
[2:25:52] So out of that confusion, God did
[2:25:53] something remarkable yet something he
[2:25:56] always seems to do. I want you TO
[2:25:59] UNDERSTAND, HE DID NOT TRY TO FIX BABEL.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; HE CALLED A MAN OUT OF IT.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; AND THE LORD SAID TO ABRAM, "GET THEE
[2:26:08] OUT OF THAT COUNTRY UNTO A LAND WHICH I
[2:26:10] WILL SHOW YOU."
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; AND GOD SEPARATED ABRAHAM FROM THE CHAOS
[2:26:15] SO A DIVINE ORDER COULD BE ESTABLISHED.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; You see, Abraham wasn't chosen because
[2:26:20] he WAS GREAT, BUT BECAUSE HE WAS WILLING
[2:26:23] TO BELIEVE and to obey. AND THE BIBLE
[2:26:26] SAID HE BELIEVED in the Lord and it was
[2:26:28] counted to him for righteousness.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; And through Abraham, God called a
[2:26:33] righteous seed, a people through whom he
[2:26:36] would reveal his word. And later that
[2:26:37] word would come in the form of law. And
[2:26:39] that was not to enslave them. It was it
[2:26:42] was to order a nation for he said he
[2:26:46] showeth his word unto Jacob, his
[2:26:48] statutes, and his judgment unto Israel.
[2:26:50] So this is what God does.
[2:26:53] So when he calls, he calls to separate
[2:26:56] you from disorder,
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; from chaos.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; And I want you to see the message that
[2:27:04] we have today. It is not A MESSAGE TO
[2:27:07] UNITE WITH THE WORLD TO BE LIKE THEM.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; It is A MESSAGE TO COME OUT OF HER MY
[2:27:12] people
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; to COME OUT OF THE BABYLON, COME OUT OF
[2:27:17] BABEL
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; and come to come unto me, sayeth the
[2:27:20] Lord. I want to put order in your life.
[2:27:22] AND WHEN I WHEN YOU COME TO ME, I PUT
[2:27:25] ORDER. I BRING order
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; because when his word is received, his
[2:27:33] people come out and that's when order is
[2:27:35] restored and his purpose is clarified.
[2:27:38] Now, brother Brandham warned us. He
[2:27:42] warned us like that. He said, "We took
[2:27:44] dress and try to fulfill what the
[2:27:46] modders tried to bring to bring them in.
[2:27:49] you'll never win them like that. In
[2:27:50] other words, we try to dress like them
[2:27:52] to bring them in. That was my my cousins
[2:27:54] ideas, you know, the Pentecostal girls.
[2:27:56] That was my first cousins. They wore
[2:27:59] their miniskirts, you know, because how
[2:28:00] can we witness to people about Christ if
[2:28:03] we if we look like old foggies? Nobody
[2:28:05] will talk to us. So, we dress like them
[2:28:07] and our miniskirts so we can win them to
[2:28:09] Christ.
[2:28:12] And brother Brandon said, "We took dress
[2:28:14] and try to fulfill what the moderators
[2:28:16] try to do to bring them in. You'll never
[2:28:18] win them by that. They got more of that
[2:28:19] than you have. You have got no business
[2:28:22] on their ground.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; Let them come over to yours where the
[2:28:25] real baptism is shining, where the real
[2:28:28] power of THE RESURRECTION. DON'T TRY TO
[2:28:31] BUILD A CHURCH LIKE THEIRS. DON'T TRY to
[2:28:34] have a pastor like theirs. AMEN. DON'T
[2:28:38] TRY TO DO THIS OR other corporate with
[2:28:41] THE WORLD. THEY SHINE WITH HOLLYWOOD.
[2:28:43] The real gospel glows with power. Eagles
[2:28:46] hear that. They don't look for a shine.
[2:28:48] They look for a glow. Glowing with
[2:28:49] humility. Glowing with love. Glowing
[2:28:51] with power. And that's where real eagles
[2:28:53] hunt. You can't scratch in a barnyard
[2:28:56] and please him. You'll never be able to
[2:28:58] do it. You can never tell it to him
[2:29:00] because he don't believe it. But let
[2:29:01] that voice SCREAM FROM HEAVEN. I AM HE
[2:29:04] THAT WAS dead and I'm alive for again.
[2:29:07] Something takes place. I'M THE SAME
[2:29:09] YESTERDAY, TODAY, and forever. And it
[2:29:12] shall come to pass in THE LAST DAYS.
[2:29:14] I'LL POUR OUT MYSELF UPON ALL FLESH.
[2:29:16] Glory to God. I'll quicken your mortal
[2:29:18] language. I'll quicken your mortal
[2:29:20] tongues. I'll give YOU THE EVIDENCE THAT
[2:29:22] I'M GOING TO BRING YOU IN THE
[2:29:24] resurrection with me. And hungry hearted
[2:29:26] eagles reach for that as hard as they
[2:29:28] can. It's the pearl of great price. And
[2:29:31] they sell everything to go buy.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; BUT GUESS WHAT? CHICKENS RUN FROM THAT
[2:29:36] VOICE. And one day we'll cry for the
[2:29:39] rocks and the mountain to hide them from
[2:29:41] the wrath of the lamb and the
[2:29:42] tribulation to come. But hungryarted
[2:29:46] eagles reach for that that says I'm the
[2:29:49] same yesterday, today, and forever. And
[2:29:52] I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'll quicken your mortal
[2:29:58] language, h your mortal tongues. I'll
[2:30:01] give you the evidence. I'm going to
[2:30:02] bring you in the rapture. And the
[2:30:04] chickens will cluck and say that the
[2:30:06] SCRIPTURE IN JOEL IS NOT OUR
[2:30:08] MANIFESTATION.
[2:30:10] And let me TELL YOU, FOR THEM IT ISN'T
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S NOT FOR CHICKENS.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; THEY WILL NEVER FLY THAT HIGH.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; BUT THOSE WHO LIVES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN
[2:30:21] ORDER BY THE WORD WILL FLY THAT HIGH
[2:30:24] BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; And when he moves, light dawn. And when
[2:30:29] LIGHT COMES, IT BRINGS SEPARATION. and
[2:30:31] sin and unbelief separates.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; Now, let me bring this down to close
[2:30:40] cuz we have to find the place
[2:30:47] as we look at this for a moment.
[2:30:52] I want you to think
[2:30:56] about a woman
[2:31:05] You know, sometimes
[2:31:08] you look at all the Old Testament as
[2:31:09] types,
[2:31:12] but did you know there's types in the
[2:31:13] New Testament?
[2:31:17] Because they were prophesying of an end
[2:31:18] time people.
[2:31:23] There was a woman by the name of Mary
[2:31:25] Magdalene
[2:31:27] out of whom he cast seven devils.
[2:31:32] She types the woman the bride in the
[2:31:35] last day.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; Because she WAS A WOMAN WALKING IN
[2:31:40] CHAOS.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; I mean, somebody's got seven devils.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of chaos in their lives.
[2:31:48] You know, you know, brother Brandham,
[2:31:51] Brother Brandham defined one of them as
[2:31:54] a high school spirit,
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; hardy,
[2:31:59] rebellious.
[2:32:02] I don't know what all they were, but as
[2:32:05] I said about Legion last week,
[2:32:08] you invite one devil to live with you
[2:32:11] and he invites another
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; until finally your identity is no longer
[2:32:19] your own. It's with the devil who has
[2:32:20] you control legion. My name is Legion.
[2:32:30] This woman had seven devils.
[2:32:37] This woman, this bride in this end time
[2:32:40] is a people
[2:32:43] of whom all of the unbelief of seven
[2:32:45] ages was heaped upon.
[2:32:50] And it took a word of God to take and
[2:32:52] cast it out.
[2:32:55] But I want you to know
[2:32:58] PERHAPS SHE WAS THAT Mary
[2:33:02] that was in Simon's house. Now there's
[2:33:04] two occasions
[2:33:07] of that of a Mary, BUT PERHAPS SHE WAS
[2:33:10] THAT woman
[2:33:12] at Simon the Pharisees house
[2:33:15] and her life was in chaos.
[2:33:20] Her life was a disaster.
[2:33:23] SHE had lived in EVERY KIND OF SIN UNTIL
[2:33:26] she had become a prostitute.
[2:33:33] BUT PASSING BY,
[2:33:35] passing by, she saw Jesus,
[2:33:39] that prophet,
[2:33:42] that one who had delivered others,
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; THAT ONE WHO COULD BRING ORDER INTO
[2:33:49] CHAOS. THE ONE WHO WOULD TAKE A BLIND
[2:33:51] BARNAMEUS
[2:33:52] WHOSE LIFE WAS IN DARKNESS, WHOSE LIFE
[2:33:55] WAS IN CHAOS, AND WOULD TAKE AND TURN
[2:33:57] THAT around and BRING HIM FROM DARKNESS
[2:34:01] INTO LIGHT. AMEN.
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; And bring order into his life.
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; And she looked at him and she said,
[2:34:08] "There's that prophet of Galilee
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; who brings order."
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; And passing by that way,
[2:34:19] she saw he had a need.
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; She saw he was unwelcomed in Leodysa.
[2:34:30] that he HIS FEET WAS NOT WASHED,
[2:34:34] that he his hair was was not oiled and
[2:34:37] and and the bomb put on him from the
[2:34:40] travel
[2:34:42] AND THE OINTMENT WAS NOT PUT ON HIM AND
[2:34:44] HE SAW HIM IN A CORNER NEGLECTED.
[2:34:49] YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES WE SEE OUR OWN
[2:34:52] problems and WE SEE OUR OWN SITUATIONS.
[2:34:56] But I wonder sometimes if we could just
[2:34:58] look away and see right now that there
[2:35:02] IS A CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN REJECTED BY
[2:35:05] LEODYSIA WHO IS OUTSIDE OF THE DOOR AND
[2:35:08] HE IS KNOCKING.
[2:35:12] And yet this woman looks upon him AND
[2:35:15] SHE REALIZES HE IS THE ONE WHO TURNS
[2:35:18] CHAOS
[2:35:20] INTO ORDER. AND I TELL YOU WHAT, I'M
[2:35:22] WILLING TO GIVE EVERYTHING I GOT.
[2:35:26] YES.
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; ALL THE MONEY I HAVE SAVED, ALL THE
[2:35:29] PROVISIONS I HAVE, AND GO AND GET THE
[2:35:33] BEST ALABASTER BOX.
[2:35:37] TO GO AND GET THE ointment
[2:35:41] to crown him king of my life
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; AND TO LAY MYSELF DOWN AT HIS FEET AND
[2:35:49] WASH HIS FEET WITH MY tears
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; so he can turn my life that is in chaos
[2:35:57] into order.
[2:36:03] I'll tell you what,
[2:36:05] when the self-styled religious saw that
[2:36:08] altar
[2:36:10] with that woman a mess
[2:36:15] with that woman crying out with that
[2:36:19] woman kissing his feet with that woman
[2:36:22] there, you know,
[2:36:26] asking forgiveness, asking for mercy,
[2:36:29] with that woman PUTTING THE THE BEST
[2:36:32] OINTMENT UPON HIM TO TAKE THE STAKE OFF
[2:36:36] OF him
[2:36:38] that man had put upon him
[2:36:41] BECAUSE GOD HAD COME AND WALKED THE PATH
[2:36:44] OF MAN. And there as he HAD WALKED THE
[2:36:47] PATH OF MAN, THE STINK OF THE PATH HAD
[2:36:50] GOT HIS FEET DIRTY. BUT THIS WOMAN SAW
[2:36:54] he needed service
[2:36:56] and she was not willing to allow him to
[2:36:59] sit there. But the unwelcome Christ
[2:37:02] neglected, forgotten,
[2:37:05] &gt;&gt; and abandoned.
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; Because he was the only hope she had.
[2:37:12] &gt;&gt; No man that she had ever got anything
[2:37:15] from had ever brought order to her life.
[2:37:17] Every man had always added more disorder
[2:37:20] and chaos, more hurt, more confusion.
[2:37:25] But let me tell you this one when he
[2:37:28] came, he came to restore divine order.
[2:37:31] He healed the sick. He forgave sins. He
[2:37:35] cast out devils. He spoke with authority
[2:37:38] not derived from tradition but from
[2:37:40] heaven himself.
[2:37:42] And where religion had confused, he came
[2:37:45] and HE CLARIFIED WHERE SYSTEMS HAD BOUND
[2:37:47] MEN DOWN. CHRIST SET THEM FREE. AMEN.
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, he came TO BRING ORDER. BUT I
[2:37:54] WANT YOU TO KNOW HERE, THIS WOMAN COMES
[2:37:58] TO GIVE him worship.
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN HE DOES, IT'S OUT OF order
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; to the human thinking.
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; AND THE HUMAN THINKING thinks he has
[2:38:13] turned my feast into chaos. This woman
[2:38:16] has
[2:38:18] kissing, crying, washing,
[2:38:23] but it wasn't chaos.
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; IT WAS DIVINE ORDER.
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAD MOVED.
[2:38:34] THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAD BROUGHT HER. THE
[2:38:36] SPIRIT OF GOD CAUSED HER TO KNEEL. THE
[2:38:38] SPIRIT OF GOD CAUSED HER TO WEEP.
[2:38:41] I KNOW WE DON'T WANT EMOTION IN THE
[2:38:43] CHURCHES ANYMORE, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
[2:38:45] WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES.
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES, IT
[2:38:51] BRINGS NOT MAN'S ORDER ANYMORE. IT DON'T
[2:38:54] BRING STINESS AND IT brings hallelujah.
[2:38:58] It brings a true worship.
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; IT BREAKS OUT OF MAN'S ORDER INTO GOD'S
[2:39:03] ORDER.
[2:39:09] And this WOMAN BEGAN TO CRY and she
[2:39:12] began to weep and she be to repent of
[2:39:14] her sin. AND AND THE PHARISEE, THE
[2:39:17] RELIGIOUS ORDER CALLED IT CHAOS. AND
[2:39:20] JESUS saw order.
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; This is orderly worship. This is whom
[2:39:27] the father seeks
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; to worship me in spirit and in truth.
[2:39:31] Amen.
[2:39:33] &gt;&gt; And she began to scream and to cry.
[2:39:37] And Pharisees said, "If he only knew,
[2:39:42] you see, he's no prophet. If he only
[2:39:45] knew what sort of woman
[2:39:48] it was washing his feet."
[2:39:52] You know what I think?
[2:39:55] We sometimes sing the song,
[2:39:59] when he was on the cross, I was on his
[2:40:01] mind.
[2:40:03] But when he watched that woman,
[2:40:06] he was watching you.
[2:40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. AMEN.
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; HE WAS LOOKING past through time
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; and HE WAS SEEING A PEOPLE WHO WOULD
[2:40:15] LEAVE THE ORDER OF PHARISEIC RELIGION OF
[2:40:19] DENOMINATIONALISM
[2:40:20] AND THE ORDER OF MAN AND WOULD GET IN
[2:40:23] THE ORDER OF THE SPIRIT LONG ENOUGH TO
[2:40:25] GET SAVED.
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID WHEN I
[2:40:29] GOT SAVED HE SAID I GOT OUT OF ORDER. I
[2:40:32] GOT IN THE SPIRIT. I THIS OLD HEART
[2:40:34] BEGIN TO CRY AND WEEP OUT BEFORE GOD.
[2:40:38] You see, because what man calls disorder
[2:40:43] and chaos, God calls order.
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; And as he watched her,
[2:40:50] he says,
[2:40:52] I think of it when he laid his hands on
[2:40:55] that woman, Mary Magdalene.
[2:40:58] He says,
[2:41:00] "I'm laying hands on my bride who one
[2:41:04] day will be so possessed
[2:41:08] with all the isms of man.
[2:41:11] But one word from me
[2:41:13] &gt;&gt; will heal her."
[2:41:15] &gt;&gt; Because when a message released, light
[2:41:18] dawn. And when light dawn, disorder
[2:41:21] leaves
[2:41:22] &gt;&gt; and chaos goes
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; and order begins.
[2:41:30] And he said,
[2:41:32] "You Pharisees,
[2:41:34] you religious system,
[2:41:37] you wouldn't wash my feet.
[2:41:40] You was You would not
[2:41:43] anoint me.
[2:41:45] You wouldn't give me what was due.
[2:41:49] But this woman,
[2:41:51] but this woman,
[2:41:53] I don't know about you, but I want to be
[2:41:56] this woman.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; But this woman, your sins, which are
[2:42:00] many,
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; are all forgiven you.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHAT WAS HE DOING? HE WAS
[2:42:08] BRINGING ORDER
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; INTO A LIFE OF CONFUSION, INTO A LIFE OF
[2:42:14] CHAOS.
[2:42:15] AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S TO DO FOR YOU IN
[2:42:17] YOUR LIFE TODAY. IS TO BRING YOU OUT OF
[2:42:20] CHAOS
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; INTO order around himself.
[2:42:25] &gt;&gt; Where your life is peaceful,
[2:42:29] &gt;&gt; where sorrow ends, where joy begins,
[2:42:33] where love is expressed,
[2:42:36] where perfect harmony remains forever.
[2:42:42] Let's bow our heads together as
[2:42:44] musicians come now.
[2:42:51] What men called order, God called chaos.
[2:42:56] And where chaos ruled, the word stepped
[2:42:59] in to restore life.
[2:43:01] And when he does, life is divine order.
[2:43:06] And I'll tell you what, if the spirit of
[2:43:07] God is not the life of a movement, then
[2:43:09] it's chaos.
[2:43:14] We're moving into a cycle where
[2:43:17] phariseic religion is moving.
[2:43:21] Where rabbis, teachers of synagogues
[2:43:24] have raised up,
[2:43:27] every man with his own idea
[2:43:30] trying to bring their own order.
[2:43:33] But that always brings chaos.
[2:43:36] The order of the Holy Ghost is to
[2:43:39] worship him in spirit and truth. And God
[2:43:42] wants to bring you out of the chaos of
[2:43:45] your mind, out of the chaos of your
[2:43:47] heart
[2:43:49] into divine order.
[2:43:54] I want to ask you.
[2:43:58] Lord,
[2:44:00] let this be a time
[2:44:03] where the spirit of God moves.
[2:44:08] I have something in my heart. I have
[2:44:10] something in my life.
[2:44:13] Come breathe on me.
[2:44:17] Bring me Lord into that highest order
[2:44:20] where I'm not just in an image by your
[2:44:22] word and and I reached a certain form of
[2:44:25] religion
[2:44:27] that's still a lifeless corpse.
[2:44:31] Breathe on me, Lord.
[2:44:33] Breathe on me.
[2:44:36] Let the spirit of the Lord
[2:44:40] breathe.
[2:44:48] Just takes one moment in his presence.
[2:44:55] Just one moment in his presence.
[2:45:00] But it takes a humble heart.
[2:45:03] It takes somebody willing to wash his
[2:45:04] feet.
[2:45:07] It takes somebody who's willing to give
[2:45:09] their all to get the best alabaster box,
[2:45:18] who make that full surrender,
[2:45:22] who yield themselves completely.
[2:45:28] I want you to look at your own life
[2:45:29] today and I want you to see,
[2:45:32] is there chaos?
[2:45:38] For some of you, sin has taken you
[2:45:39] further than you ever imagined you'd go.
[2:45:46] But are you willing to move out of your
[2:45:48] comfort zone
[2:45:50] to give your all
[2:45:54] to surrender everything
[2:45:57] to come under divine headship?
[2:46:03] Are you willing to let the spirit of God
[2:46:05] move
[2:46:08] upon your life? Will you invite him
[2:46:13] that you as you make a move toward God,
[2:46:17] he can turn to you and say, "Your sins
[2:46:23] are all forgiven."
[2:46:27] There's no greater words than that.
[2:46:31] There's no greater words than that. Ever
[2:46:34] trespass
[2:46:36] under the blood.
[2:46:38] You're free.
[2:46:40] The demons that held you bound and
[2:46:42] tormented you day and night gone.
[2:46:46] And you're free to serve the living God.
[2:46:50] You don't have to live in that
[2:46:52] condition.
[2:46:53] There's a God calling you to separate
[2:46:56] from the chaos,
[2:46:59] to separate from sin, from unbelief.
[2:47:04] Allow him to do it today.
[2:47:07] How many would say today, God bring some
[2:47:09] order in my life?
[2:47:11] How many would say today, Lord, oh God,
[2:47:15] breathe on me.
[2:47:17] Let me be the highest order of your
[2:47:19] creation. where Lord, you just form me
[2:47:22] in your image, but more than that, you
[2:47:24] breathe your own life into me to where
[2:47:27] I'm alive with the spirit, where I move
[2:47:29] with him,
[2:47:32] that out of chaos, he brings order.
[2:47:36] I want to be yielded to you, Lord.
[2:47:40] If you'll wash his feet this morning,
[2:47:43] he'll say to you, too, your sins
[2:47:47] are all forgiven.
[2:47:50] I say to this woman,
[2:47:53] I say to this man,
[2:47:56] I say to this person,
[2:47:58] your sins
[2:48:00] are forgiven.
[2:48:07] Oh, let it breathe
[2:48:11] on me.
[2:48:13] Let it breathe
[2:48:16] on me.
[2:48:18] Let the Holy
[2:48:21] Ghost
[2:48:23] now breathe
[2:48:26] on me.
[2:48:29] Let him breathe
[2:48:32] on me.

[2:48:40] Let the Holy
[2:48:43] Ghost

[2:48:52] me now.

[2:48:57] me now.
[2:49:00] Let the Holy
[2:49:02] Ghost

[2:49:09] Oh, let him feel
[2:49:12] me now.
[2:49:14] Let him feel
[2:49:17] me now.
[2:49:19] Let go.
[2:49:24] Oh, feel
[2:49:26] me now.
[2:49:29] Let him feel
[2:49:31] me now.
[2:49:34] Let him feel
[2:49:36] me now.
[2:49:39] Let the Holy
[2:49:42] Ghost
[2:49:44] just be. What do I do, brother Tim? Go
[2:49:48] washing his feet.
[2:49:50] Amen. That's exactly right. Come on.
[2:49:53] Give him that worship that he deserves.
[2:49:55] Go to washing his feet right now. Go to
[2:49:58] give him the praise, the honor in your
[2:50:02] life. Amen. Let the joy bells ring
[2:50:06] because you can do him a service this
[2:50:09] morning that you can move in his life
[2:50:12] your life. Let him move in your life and
[2:50:14] move darkness and set from you.
[2:50:18] &gt;&gt; Let him feel you now.
[2:50:20] &gt;&gt; Let the Holy
[2:50:22] Ghost
[2:50:24] &gt;&gt; just feel
[2:50:26] me now. Make it your prayer. Let him
[2:50:29] breathe
[2:50:31] on me.
[2:50:34] Let it brea.
[2:50:39] Let the
[2:50:42] ghost
[2:50:46] on me.
[2:50:49] Let it breathe
[2:50:51] on me.
[2:50:54] Let it breathe
[2:50:56] on me.
[2:50:59] and the Holy
[2:51:01] Ghost
[2:51:04] now breathe
[2:51:06] on me.
[2:51:08] Let him feel
[2:51:11] me now.
[2:51:14] Let him feel
[2:51:16] me now.
[2:51:18] Let the Holy
[2:51:21] Ghost

[2:51:26] me now.
[2:51:28] Let him feel
[2:51:30] me now.
[2:51:33] Let him feel.
[2:51:40] Holy Ghost.
[2:51:43] Now feel

[2:51:59] Ghost

[2:52:27] That's a dear path for the water.
[2:52:30] Amen.
[2:52:35] &gt;&gt; The water soul my soul
[2:52:39] is after
[2:52:41] me.

[2:56:07] savior,
[2:56:10] precious redeemer and friend.
[2:56:17] Who would have thought that the lamb
[2:56:21] could
[2:56:23] rescue the souls of men?

[3:04:57] name. Here I am again.
[3:05:05] Oh, just to worship you.
[3:05:12] You were not a God
[3:05:15] created
[3:05:17] by human hands.
[3:05:21] You were not a god
[3:05:23] depending
[3:05:26] on any mortal man.
[3:05:29] You are not a god
[3:05:32] need of
[3:05:34] anything

[3:06:31] praise will never end. You're the only
[3:06:35] God who's worthy.
[3:06:39] Everything we give. You are God.
[3:06:44] That's just the way it is.
[3:06:49] Oh, you are God of all
[3:06:53] before time begin.
[3:06:57] You are on your throne.
[3:07:01] You are God alone
[3:07:05] and right now in the good times. Oh, and
[3:07:10] the fact you are on your throne.
[3:07:15] You are God alone.

[3:07:29] You're the only God whose name
[3:07:34] praise will never end. You're the only
[3:07:37] God who's worthy of everything we need.
[3:07:43] You are God.
