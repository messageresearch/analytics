to gather together and to worship together and sing songs of Zion and Let Your Presence just fall Among Us Lord and begin to move and touch hearts and lives give us strength Lord for the journey ahead Lord God father we just ask that you would come and you'd speak to our hearts tonight or encourage us the Lord in this season as we're about ready to change another year the calendar is about to change and move into another year or truly we could say once again you've led us safely this far and Lord we're going to put our trust in you no matter what year may come up what day may come up what situation may arise Lord we can trust you we just ask father you just moved to dot tonight in our hearts Lord there be anything we've done or said that would be pleasing to you father that you'd wash Us by your blood that you would just come and mend our hearts Lord tonight we pray we commit this service to your hands in Jesus name let's turn to Psalms chapter 23 and verse 1. also on that last Sunday of the month at that business meeting there'll be dinner and communion as well in January the last last Sunday in January so we probably put something up on the slide for that as well looking forward to our New Year's meetings it's going to be a wonderful time of the Lord amen and I really love these three young brothers that are coming to share their hearts with us and I believe we'll all be blessed amen and uh and uh so uh brother Ronnie and brother Nathan and brother Isaac just find young men in the gospel and found them to be faithful men and we're looking forward to What the Lord Has for us also remember next Wednesday there will be no service it'll be moved to to the Friday night so just put that on your calendar as well amen Psalms chapter 23 and verse 1. amen probably one of the most familiar scriptures that there is and and one of the most uh memorized scriptures that there is and and the one the most read scriptures and it's a wonderful scripture and it's uh More Than Just Words but I believe that they're inspired words and and is very pertinent to the day that we're living in Psalms chapter 23 and verse 1 says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the past of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemy thou anointest my head with all my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen will let you be seated today I'd like to speak to you on the light the shepherd Amen to be even a lot to do with what we spoke on the guide because a Shepherd is a guide as we've read here in our scripture he speaks about he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he leadeth me in pass of righteousness a pass of righteousness for his namesake and I I thought this is part of this has always spoke to me because it in verse 4 it says though I'll walk through the valley of the shadow of death to for there to be a shadow there has to be a light is not the valley of complete darkness is not the valley of complete loss is not the valley of of complete destruction but there's something there amen that giveth hope and we find he said and in this in the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for thou art with me amen thy rod or Thy word and thy staff they comfort me you know David presents God as a shepherd and in doing so he also Compares us to being sheep uh the intent was to highlight the total devotion Christians are meant to have towards their lord and and savior and not only that but his devotion towards his people amen because we are under his care and we're under his care amen we'll find security we'll have safety amen you know it's it's in a Shepherd the qualifications are sheep are completely dependent on their Shepherd they receive safety they receive food they receive guidance from the shepherd they follow and obey the shepherd on Instinct you know some Scholars look at this scripture and I've done a lot of reading and researching on what different ones would say about it but a lot of them look at the scripture about preparing a table of how that they used to take a trough and they would put a raised table and and they would put feet in it and they'd use oil to keep the flowers away but others would look at that more of a a a say in how how soldiers are being prepared for battles with a feast and and an anointing of all to be put upon them and I believe that's what is speaking about us say man it's not that God is a has built some table somewhere or someplace or or some certain building but God is preparing a feast Amen to give for we to get strength but not to just have a feast to gain strength but anoint him that will take us through a man that will give us the victory over our enemies but the main theme through this whole scripture if you read it again and you Ponder and you look on it is the main theme of The Psalm is you are with me God Is With Us amen he's always close in every moment and and when you take a hold of that truth and and you begin to look at that and you realize I'm never alone we're we're always looked after and therefore we never have a reason to lose hope because God is walking with us and he's tending to his flock amen and we can read scriptures there's tons of them about referring to him as a Shepherd in Genesis 48 it says God who has been my shepherd All My Life To This Day Psalms 28 would say savior people and bless your inheritance be their Shepherd and carry them forever amen Isaiah 40 verse 11 said he tends his flock Like a Shepherd he he gathers the Lambs in his arms and he carries them close to his heart he gently leads those that have young John 10 and verse 14 says I am the Good Shepherd I know my sheep and my sheep know me just as the father knows me and I know the father and I lay down my life for the sheep first Peter would say it like this when the chief Shepherd appears we shall receive a Crown of Glory that will never fade away but looking at this scripture different translations of Psalms 23 and verse 1. as we just kind of expand upon these things things the the one version would say it one translation would say Jehovah is my shepherd I shall not want the Amplified would say it the Lord is my shepherd to feed and to guide me and to Shield me and I shall not want another translation says You Lord are my shepherd and I will never be in need another translation says the Lord is my shepherd and I have everything I ever needed amen what a Shepherd that we can depend upon amen one a Shepherd who is Dependable that is with us that leads us that guides us that is with us every step of the way and in this in this knowing of how Dependable that he is we can be at rest to know God is looking after each situation that we go through God is there guiding God is there directing God is there moving God is there amen amen in every situation if you're in the Valley of Death the light is still there if you're in the valley of trouble God is still there amen and so we can look at these as the different things that has brought out one I like nothing so there can be a contentment there that God will provide All I Ever Need so I can relax and stop striving I can relax and let him take control I can relax and let him provide and him meet my needs another one is rest he makes me lie down in green pastors or or God invites us into moments of Stillness so we can rest amidst our busyness that's a good one right there because the age that we live in is a very busy age amen we got more advancements than ever but we're more busy than busier than ever amen you go to a kitchen nowadays used to the man would have to prepare they might have to go out and kill their food and then progress their food or reflector or vegetables that they was going to clean them and all of this but now today normally you go to a shopping center and you you know you find something that you want to eat you take it home and you put it in a God forbid in the microwave or an oven or whatever it is a lot of things that go along a lot faster but we're more busier than we ever been amen Satan has devised it to be this way but God invites us into moments of Stillness in the moments that we can just stop for a moment I mean I believe that's what it is on a Wednesday night just to stop for a moment and realize us the goodness of God just to stop for a moment and realize you know what God has brought me safely this far God has brought me to this place Amen to where I'm at he's watched over my life he's took me out of trouble he brought me out of sin he brought me out of the myory clay he set my feet upon the rock why should I get down to 2023 and realize or think that God has can't he can't do no more or he ain't got enough but God has showed over and over and over that I am more than enough amen and so as also in this scripture there's peace he leads me beside Quiet Waters God calms Us in challenging times amen there's a calmness to a Believer why because you're not listening to the voices of this world you're not listening the voices of Fox News or CNN that's not where you get your calmness from no sir you get your calmness from listening to the voice of God and the voice of God is calling and unto you and saying whosoever will come and let him drink whosoever will come and I'll take your burdens off of you whosoever will there is a voice that is speaking Amen to the Sheep of almighty God also there's a restoration in here it's a he refreshes my soul God promises in this that he will renew our Spirits so we will be strengthened and continue to go forward see God is interested in a journey he he didn't bring the children of Israel out amen I think it's uh he shows himself to be the light the shepherd to them because it wasn't God driving them it was God leading them they followed the light they followed the pillar of cloud there by night and or the fire by night in the cloud by day amen what was it it was the great shepherd He was leading them and he led them to some very difficult places he led them to the Red Sea he led them to Bitter Waters he led them to places there was no water he led them to places there was no food he led them over over and over showing he is a shepherd and each moment he was able to provide for them and that gives me great strength and courage to know and look back to what he was then I know he is today that he's still leading the Church of the Living God by the pillar of fire amen the shepherd is still pushed moving and when he moves the church moves and when he goes the church goes amen he's still the shepherd and we may go through some dark places we may go through some difficult times we have come through would come through difficult sicknesses we come through difficult deaths we come through difficult years amen and things begin to turn upside down and backwards but each step of the way the shepherd has showed over and over I'm the one that's leading I'm the one that's guided and I still have the answer for whatever date you're facing for whatever trouble you're facing for whatever thing you're facing I still have the answer so we can have I am strength in these times that we live in also there's wisdom amen as it guides me along the right path for his namesake God wants to reveal himself and his ways to us so he so we can know him better and so he'll lead us down certain paths to show himself certain attributes of himself to you sometimes he'll lead you down a path of sickness to show himself as a Healer to you or otherwise if you was always well you would never know he could be a Healer sure you might have somebody else's testimony but God wants to have your you to have your testimony and so you go through darkness and you go through things amen why God is going to show himself you who he really is David goes on with this with this as we read down even though I walk to the darkest Valley I will fear no evil for thou art with me you know as a as a warrior in the King David often face danger he always faced danger there was lines there was Bears there were giants there was the enemy that was always there was another king that was trying to kill him but he never forgot the lessons he learned about God as a young Shepherd the rest of his life though most of us don't have to have to deal with the same things maybe David dealt with I doubt very seriously many of you have ever been in a fight with a bear or with a lion and amen but there's all other things that we have to deal with we have to deal with challenges every day we have some of them are very painful some trials go and job loss or medical issues or relationship troubles but there's nothing that is a is a match for our almighty God for the Shepherd that is watching over us God is leading you he is guiding you and he's with you every step of the journey and when we look to him we find strength to walk confidently through the hardest of struggles amen you prepare a table for me in the presence of my enemies you anoint my head with oil my cup overflowing as you know David he loved to Worship the Lord amen his songs were abounding with Thanksgiving and praise and honor unto Jehovah amen when he was in the valley he would find strength in a song when he was on top of a mountain he would find strength in the song David was always aware of both his own lack but also of the greatness of his God you know you can read about it he talks about his lack and and what he like but also in that he would show God is greater than my lack God is greater than the situation that I'm going you know it's important that you remember in your life he's still Jehovah Jireh amen he's still the provider he'll still meet your needs the more we celebrate His blessings and we're in time we're in a time of Celebration so let's just celebrate tonight maybe we celebrate His blessings and others around us the more we'll have faith and what he's going to do for us going forward when you begin to lift him up and praise him for what he's already done for you then faith will begin to resonate in your heart that the same God that took care of you there is the same God that takes care of you now the same one that walked through that Valley with me he'll walk to the next Valley with me Hallelujah throughout his lifetime David found himself in a lot of different places he found himself working in fields hiding in caves ruling in the palace Leading Armies into battle running from armies amen trying to kill him he truly believed though that always God remained close to him wherever he wherever he was that did not change nothing about where God was if they can just anchor in somebody's heart tonight that no matter where you are that does not change where God is amen God is with you God is leading you God is guiding you he's a Shepherd amen you might be through some of the darkest times of your life but the light is still with you we go through things in our daily lives we may end up in a place or a day that we didn't expect but knowing that our Lord will always go with us not only with us but before us should bring a sense of of of of rest a sense of even boldness in our steps amen so we know he is the shepherd we know uh that he leads and guides let's look at John chapter 10 and verse 7. then Jesus said unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the Sheep and all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find Pastor the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and destroy I am come that they might have life that they might have it more abundantly I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his life for his sheep but he that is a hireling and not the shepherd who's on the sheep or not see it the wolf coming and leaveth the Sheep that's not a real Shepherd a real Shepherd when a wolf comes he's going to run the wolf away amen but they're hireling when he sees a wolf coming he's going to run and leave the shepherd or leave the Sheep to be eight to be devired but this is this is not God when God sees your battle coming he's not going to run away amen let me tell you he sees it coming a lot further he could have had a lot further hurt than you ever thought about having because he sees it coming a long ways off but he's not running from your battles he's not running from your sicknesses he's not running from your trouble but he's leading you and he's guiding you and he's staying with you every step of the way Hallelujah he says leave it the sheep and fleeth and the Wolf catches them and scattereth the Sheep the hireling fleas because he's a hireling and cares not for the Sheep but I am the Good Shepherd and no my sheep Hallelujah listen it ain't important that the president of the United States knows you it ain't important if the if the mayor and Minden knows you it ain't important if anybody else knows you as long as he knows you [Applause] um because if he knows you he's known you before the foundation of the world and he's called you by name my sheep know my voice amen and I said I know my sheep but I'm also known of mine my sheep knows me I know my sheep and my sheep knows me has anybody ever I'm sure it went around pretty much viral that of that Shepherd that was standing there looking over that little Valley of sheep and there was others that was hollering at them and they had their head in the grass they wasn't paying no attention and the shepherd just kind of saying some things I maybe was in a different language I don't remember but the gist of it was they were hollering they were screaming they were trying to get their attention but the Sheep just kept on eating grass but as soon as the shepherd spoke and he began to call for them and the heads came up and they began to look around they found him and when they found them they began to run make a beeline towards the shepherd because they knew his voice hallelujah amen real sheep that knows the voice of the shepherd they're not concerned when false doctrines arise and Devils of every kind starts to speak and howl and say all kinds of things and make threats and not worried about that that ain't the voice I'm listening to The Voice I'm listening to is the voice of the Good Shepherd I'm not listening to the voice that says I'm not his I'm listening to the voice that says you're mine I'm not listening to the voice it says I'm going to destroy you I'm listening to the voice that says he can't destroy you you're mine as a father knoweth me even so no other father and I lay down my life for the Sheep another sheep another sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd I believe he's talking about us right there amen therefore doth my father love me because I lay down my life that I may take it again no man taketh it from me but I lay it down I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again this commandment have I received to my father so this word Shepherd it's it's what it means to feed it means to tend to flock it means to keep the Sheep to furnish pasture for food to nurse to cherish one's body to serve the body to supply the request the needs for the soul amen but you know the task is this is written here the task of the Eastern Shepherd were the one watch for enemies they were trying to attack the Sheep and when they did defend the sheep from the attackers Hallelujah so listen when Satan comes to attack you he's not just attacking some wimpy sheep he's also attacking the shepherd the shepherd is watching for his attack but not only is he watching for his tag he's there to defend you when it happens it's also to heal the wounded and the sick sheep it's also to find the set and save the lost or trap sheep oh praise the lord it's also to love them and share their lives and so earning their trust so that's why he had to come down and be made a sheep himself where in the season he came down and the Angels Came To Who Shepherds why because there was a lamb that was being born amen he came to the Shepherds to begin to to say I am to declare that God Emmanuel was being born Emmanuel God and they go said yeah go find him he's in a stable and they go go to look for him and maybe they was expecting a lot different I don't know what that was expected but what they saw was a little baby crying in a Manger amen why because he was coming as a lamb why because he had to share our lives he had to know what it was like to be a weak sheep he had to know what it was like to get sick he had to know what it was like to have mind vitals and Troubles of every kind he had to know what it was like to feel the nervousness of the attack on coming storms and attacks and things he had to know what it was like for Satan to call me after him moment after moment after moment after moment he came to share your life so he could earn your trust Hallelujah he's a great Shepherd he's in control of every situation he knows your battles before you get there I I know what I'm talking about because just this weekend he knew my battles before I got there I went to Brother Jason Jackson's and was ministering there this past Sunday Lord had laid it on my heart when he asked me to come what to speak on I was going to speak on the light the chain breaker and I knew every time I preached that there's been a resistance there's been something trying to keep something to keep Freedom or deliverances from happening almost a physical Force when it was up there at that Youth Camp there when I first time I ever preached it it was like a physical thing trying to stop something and before the service it even started we're in the back office and brother they started singing the song actually started singing a song brother Jason went out we'd prayed he went out to the platform and I'm sitting there and the big knock comes on the door and I I don't know whether I said because they had just talked about some issues they was having they've been kind of on a high alert for a situation and so I didn't know if I was supposed to open that door or not open that door I don't think God help me he told me where a gun was so I thought well if I had you know all these things are going through your mind and I thought well if somebody really needs something they'll knock again a little harder so sort of Bam Bam he knocks on the door and say well okay I walk up the door and I open it and his brother uh Joe Van slack and he said I need brother Jason his wife's in trouble I thought wow okay and so he runs on the platform they come running back brother Jack brother Joe tells brother Jason look your wife's heartbeat rate went up to like 160 or 150 160 where they're just sitting there her watch she had on it alerted her to that and they've taken her back there was an EMT there that was checking her blood pressure it was like 220 over 110 and it was just nuts and he's like come on Timothy come with me and he said he told me later he said I want you to come because I knew you had been in that battle before amen and so I I went back there to where he was at and where she was at and we we seen it she seemed to be fine as far as it's just looking at her and things and it didn't seem to be in much stress but they finally got her her heart rate ready to start at leveling just a little bit still over a hundred we laid hands on her and began to pray and it began to come down and the blood pressure began to come down although wow this is amazing found out later another sister and that same service about the same time her heart goes crazy and she runs out and checks her blood pressure and has to go take blood pressure medicine the devil was trying to stop something and so I began to come back I go back and I get ready and they call me out and begin to preach about 30 40 minutes maybe into my sermon I'm preaching along and there's a sister about 90 years old they come to service for the first time since covert and she she had gotten sick and had a lot of issues and wasn't able to come because of her hearts and the heart issues and things and but she just I want to be in church I want to be in church and so that morning she just told her husband said honey I want to be in church he said well let's go to church so for a first service she's back and while I'm preaching she just goes lifeless just folds down and I've watched Brothers come running up and and there's a commotion going on and I stopped and I said I see what's happening here darkness is trying to put out the light but the light is going to stand against the darkness and I said let's bow our heads and pray and we bowed our heads and prayed and they got her into a wheelchair and they started willing her out and I said I don't know what what's going to happen I said it's not up to me it's up to him all I know is we prayed and we asked God to spare our life I said but if she did go it's a wonderful way to go in the house of the Lord but I said I believe the light is here to show who he is amen when about 10 minutes brother Jason came back on the platform because he had went down and prayed with her out in the audience and went out the back came back with a note and said sister Decker is back to normal she's going home with her husband amen what was it the light came and drove the darkness he don't always know you don't always know what battle you're going to be in but the light will always be there Hallelujah this bride will never walk in complete darkness there'll always be light Hallelujah God knows what we have need of the shepherd has a fold he drives a sheep in there leads them in there and after the Sheep is in he lays down in the door no sheep can go out and no wolf can come in Hallelujah unless it goes over the shepherd think how safe you are you know brother Brandon would talk he said if you know he said a few nights ago I woke up and I had a sermon on my heart of resting I didn't have an audience so I had one woman audience my wife woke her up said honey I got to preach to you about about this rest for a moment and I did it about three hours ain't that a paradox preach about rest when you're trying to sleep laughs but here he said it was just burning on my heart and I had to I had to talk to somebody he said the Christian experience is based solemnly and holy upon rest come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest we're tossed about with everything until the shepherd comes and when Christ comes the Holy Ghost comes it's finished then you're resting in Christ no matter what comes or what goes nothing can touch you unless it comes through the shepherd um he has to permit it therefore the Bible said all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord and are thee called according to his purpose it has to come over the shepherd first I am the door no man can come in without me accepting it he said let me tell you when that when God permits anything it's working for your good so would sickness be the same thing certainly God might heal you so that God can heal you to show a great testimony and give you a little something to move on for all things work together for the good notice how beautiful the shepherd laid himself at the door he didn't just pile a bunch of sheep up there he he laid himself at the door he says all of Christians who will fall away and run back and run out and run in and run out that well I can't make it you couldn't make it in the first place did you hear me before the first tug on your heart you couldn't make it so it doesn't matter if you've been in and out and in and out well I can't make it you couldn't make it in the first place it's not your place to make it God already made it for you God already made the way the price is already paid it's not our place to make it it's the shepherd's place to make it the only thing you have to do is accept God's provided way and stand in it no matter what take don't move no matter what takes place don't move rest the Shepherds watching over his sheep he knows even a sparrow when it falls so how much more does he know about you think about that little bitty bird and he knows each one that falls not one can fall to the ground and he don't know about it and you don't think he don't know about your situation and your needs and your troubles and where we're at he don't know about the political climate and the world situation he knows he knows he's a shepherd he's I noticed another thing in thinking about Shepherds you know Shepherds of Eastern countries have more respect than anybody else going down through the streets all at once the whistling the cars and stuff he said one time I was going down old an old British Jeep and first thing you know it was a Shepherd crossing the street and all the traffic was held up and gave him the right-of-way he said that's the way our Shepherd is he gets the right away do you hear that in Services he gets the right away in every situation he gets the right away he decides the path he signed he decides the direction it's up to him how it goes amen I saw as a song leader I'm not trying to make it my way or he's got to be this song of that song I pray Lord this is your service this is your people and I want you to do the directing I want you to do the leading amen if there's a song you want me to sing I'll sing it whatever God it is your service he deserves the right away I know there's a lot of churches don't want to give him the right of way they want to put up caution signs and this sign and stop signs and this and nonsense amen the shepherd deserves the right of way however he wants to go with it let him go because he knows better than any sheep does amen he said there was some he said I noticed some Shepherds up on a hill one time had all kind of different animals he's and I thought well I thought Shepherds uh Heritage was a herder of sheep he said that's right but the brother said yes right that's right brother Brad I'm a Shepherd is a herder or gravesman he says he said so there's a lot of different animals they watch after he said you know the strange thing is the shepherd is attached more to the Sheep than anything else they both eat the same food the same grass when the night time comes the mules the goats talking about the animals they're eating all the same doing this but the goats and the mules are left outside and the shepherd causes sheep into the fold I thought oh God that's what I want to be I want to be a sheep amen that's what I want to be I want to be a sheep I'm not interested in just eating the same grass and just having the same food I want to be with the shepherd I want to be with him because nighttime's coming and nighttime is going to fall one of these days and just to see just the Sheep is the only one that's going to go in Hallelujah it ain't just about church joining and this that and other you you don't know Christ by that you know him by an experience a change of nature maybe you find yourself to be a little stubborn mule but there is a power that can change that nature maybe you find yourself to just be a hog Waller and out in the world there is a power that can change that nature hey man that's what it does it don't just take a pig and dress him up and make him look like a part and put a little wool on him and make him look kind of like a sheep no this power that we're talking about will take up worldly Pig and take him out of that old sinful thing and bring him out of all that muck and all that World stuff and clean him up and change him to such a place you would never know he was ever a pig come on I'm looking at a lot of used to be pigs I'm looking at a lot of used to be lost Sinners and was out there in the world a lot of drunks a lot of dope heads a lot of this that and the other but God rich and mercy he reached down and he picked you up and he brought you out and today you would never know you never you wouldn't always a sheep Hallelujah a lot of people who first come in they look around like wow look at all this holy Bunch well let me tell you something it wasn't always holy at one time come on we weren't always holy we had a lot of things in our lives amen but God came down and it began to paint a different picture he meant to make us over a new and the Creator changed the creature [Applause] most of the ones who think they've always been holies those are still dressed up and ain't nothing but pigs amen you said well I I got I got I'm part of this church it ain't it ain't a Creed it ain't a catechism it ain't a church it isn't to know the catechism that ain't life it's the no Christ know the shepherd not to know your Creeds not to know the doctrines but to know him him alone his life to know him another thing is amazing the shepherd would come right down to the streets and on the side men with their produce laying out there with all kinds of appetizing things for the Sheep but the fellow that was driving me in the little Jeep he pulled over to one side and he said brother Brian watch this see that Shepard entering that Market Street there and I said yes sir now watch him for a few minutes he walked down to the street with about 50 sheep following him right right down through there with all them Fine Things pears and vegetables laying there which would be very tempting to a sheep but don't sheep follow the shepherd they didn't look right or left they just went right through it with the shepherd the shepherd could step out of out this way and move over this way and the every sheep would walk the same line the shepherd walks I said brother you're gonna have to excuse me for a minute I got to jump out and praise the Lord following the footsteps of the shepherd my sheep know my voice and a stranger there not followed just move where he moves step where he steps amen there's all kind of enticing things along life's journey it looks all bright and shiny on this side and the other but if you are a real sheep following the shepherd you're not looking to the right you're not looking to the left you're looking at the shepherd and you're watching where he steps and you're stepping same footprints something that God always liking people into sheep You're The Shepherd of the pastor the Sheep of one fold the other sheep have I so forth likening people unto sheep you know why he likened us the Sheep did you ever how many has ever fooled with sheep anybody ever raised sheep or had a sheep not very many not many Shepherds here he said did you ever fool he says they're not the smartest things in the world well I got this education and I got well if you're a sheep you're not smart by the world standards I'm not talking about you know what I'm talking about you're smart by his standards because you're following his oh certainly get educational Divine education to learn to shoot he said I raised them I Shepherd around the little fella when the Sheep is lost he's absolutely helpless helpless when you was lost you was absolutely helpless you couldn't make yourself better if you wanted to no no I picked up a sheep not standing maybe 300 yards from the sheepfolding oh where all the other sheep was and that sheep when he's lost he can't help himself he just stands there and bleats and bleats and bleats and bleats until the wolf gets him or something takes place he just can will never find his own way back he's totally helpless without a Shepherd that's the way human race is we were absolutely totally helpless without The Shepherd of the fold we can't find our way back amen we will never on our own strength find our way back to Eden we'll never find our way back to a body change yeah you can try to we've tried to educate our way back we try to reform our way back it'll never happen education will never do it Reformation will never do it we're not reformers policemen out there they're reform but we are preachers of the Gospel he said not to try to put people on penalty and call on your knees and so forth but to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ Deliverance to the people Hallelujah that's what sheep needs they need some sheep food you know what the best food sheep food I know for is if for you six sheep and all kinds of sheep here it is the great big bad bread basket of God man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that's what the Holy Spirit lives on that's what lives in you that lives on the word of God that is the connection of the shepherd and the Sheep foreign time he was over in the Orient learned a great lesson I'd seen it in Saint John I'm the Gate of the Sheepfold or the door of the Sheepfold often wondered how could he be in a man be a door but then when I was over there I learned what it meant Shepherds lead their sheep into the Sheepfold and they got an arch that goes over it like that and when he drives them all in and after all in he counts them and if there's one lacking it's worth going after oh my God if there's one light he'll leave the 90 and nine and go after that one lost lamb Hallelujah don't you don't that give you something to know you are important it doesn't matter what number you are every number is important he gives account for the shepherd ever or for the Sheep every hour of the day no matter where you're at he knows where you're at he knows all about you that's the reason he can stand on this platform through yielded people and reveal and tell and talk he knows he knows where you where you are was that a year ago he knows where you was all the time he has to give an account for his sheep especially they're all renumbered again after they gathered in the foe I thought what a beautiful picture Gathering them into the fold and numbering them and after he gets them all numbered and they're all bedded down the Shepherd that goes down and lays himself across the hole and no wealth can come in and no Thief can come in no harm can come in unless it comes through the shepherd first what a picture of Christ laid himself for us nothing can harm us unless it comes over him he's over the Bride of sickness crossed over him but it was for the glory of God he wants to give you a testimony he said I've seen a Shepherd one time with a leg all banged up and bandaged up so what happened he fell off a cliff he said no I broke his leg he said oh you must the man said oh you must be a cruel Shepherd to break your own sheep's leg he said no the Sheep wouldn't mind me so I broke his leg in order to hold her and to pet her and to love her and to give her some little special food in turn she would love me and follow me so sometimes God has to do that to us let the doctor say it's over nothing can be done he just comes over there and he starts putting them back together amend you and he picks you up and he starts Whispering promises and you're here doctor said it's over but my word said I'm the Healer the doctor says you're finished and you'll never be no better but I paid some stripes for you he's holding you and he's caring for you child of mine don't you know I love you don't you know I'm the Lord that healeth all that diseases but Lord I was taught that the days of marriage I know you was I just had to let this happen so I could show you a little special favor now don't you love me just a little more now I'm going to let you get well did you ever have that just come to you I have many times let something happen just to check me down a little just to check me or check up a little however you want to say it check me down a little so he can express his love to me another thing you'll notice to a shepherd oh I'm trying to stay calm here it's a disgrace for a Shepherd to lose one sheep it's a reproach it's a disgrace it's a mar on his reputation to lose one sheep therefore he said all that the father hath given me will come and I'll not lose one of them Hallelujah he faced his own reputation on that one promise I'm not going to lose one sheep I'm not going to lose one son I'm not going to lose one daughter but I haven't yet could I could a mother forget her suckling child yet but how could I ever forget you oh I'm getting down somewhere now because your names are engraved in the palm of my hand so he's not going to come down to now and say well I had 50 but only 25 made it no no if you had 50 at the beginning there's going to be 50 at the end if you had a million at the beginning there's going to be a million at the end he's not he's his reputation is standing upon this amen the shepherd cannot afford to lose a sheep that's the reason you backslaughter tonight he's still hanging around your heart he's still trying to draw you back into his fold because once he kissed you and you kissed him and he told you you loved him and you told him you loved him and he raised your hands and you praised him but then you're back slid and you went out and got all butchered up and wounded in your spirit but he's still hanging around he's still saying come on back wondering Chief I can't afford to let you be lost Hallelujah he's a man who owns a cattle on a thousand hills he's got riches Untold but he cannot afford to lose one shake he can't afford to lose one backslider he can't afford to lose one of his because it's his reputation come on back maybe the little sheep that had to go way out in the mountain to find all through the place maybe you're that sheep tonight laying out here wounded somewhere but the shepherd will not lose one of his you know how the shepherd knows his sheep from other sheep because his sheep are branded they're marked you know what they carry what Mark they carry they carry the mark of the shepherd all right amen the Sheep was marked he said oh that's like you say well that's all right preacher but how you know all these marks in all right everybody was marked one marked this weight one marked that one at the Orthodox one Episcopalian this and the other but wait a minute the shepherd bore the mark of his sheep in his hand if you want to know what the sheep that the shepherd got the mark in his hand how appropriate that is tonight of our great Shepherd this marked he said a woman might forget her mother her child forget her little suck them babe but I'll never forget you because your names are written in my hand marked the shepherd carries the mark of a sheath I know my sheep and my sheep know me why the mark they marked the same mark so they are marked with the same Mark he's marked with and he's marked with the same Mark damn marked with that his church has got the same mark what kind of Mark did he have spiritually speaking he was despised he was rejected he was a man of sorrow he was acquainted with grief he was called all kind of ungodly days amen but God was with him you want to hear about his marks God was with him signs and wonders was with him everywhere he went he could design the thoughts of the intents that are he said I do as a father show me the secret Hill the dead were raised the poor had the gospel priest and tonight the Church of the Living God bears that same Mark of the Living God on the inside of her well therefore amen they may be despised they may be rejected they may go through all kinds of things about the sick are healed and the dead are raised and the poor has the gospel preached to them and signs and wonders are following them why because they bear the same Mark that the shepherd bore might be called a fanatic he was too you might be called a Holy Roller he was too you might be called all kinds of things he was too he was people hated him you will be hated too foreign because he did right because he did good Stephen the first martyr died because he told them they were stiff-necked uncircumcised in heart and ears and they were resisting the Holy Ghost hello somebody but he was branded with the same brand the shepherd was branded with how happy we ought to be two thousand years later to see the same Holy Ghost working in the same kind of people causing the same results from the outside the point of scornful finger and also the same results on the inside for a resurrected Jesus Christ stretching forth his hands to do the same signs and wonders he did at the beginning Shepherds and sheep I'm so glad to Bear the same mark he's a sovereign God buys on Council he purposed to plan a Salvation of his own elect which he foreknew the son died upon the cross to establish the means of Salvation and the Holy Spirit carefully now executes the will of the father he is working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his will he's right in the midst of it all he's right in the midst of his church this great Creator this savior God is Faithfully working among his own right now as the great Shepherd of the Sheep his very existence is for his own he loves him and he cares for them his eyes ever upon them when the word says that your lives are HID with Christ and God it means exactly what it says I'm so glad that my God abides faith for he is true to himself he won't lie he's true to his word he will back it up he's true to us he will not lose one of us amen we need to tell the devil that he'll not lose one of us we're not leaving a hook behind I'm glad I can rest in that kind of faithfulness as we close let's look at Ezekiel 34 and verse 11. he says for thus saith the Lord God behold I even I will both search for my sheep and seek them out as a Shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered so will I seek out my sheep and we'll deliver them out of all the places where they've been scattered in the Cloudy and dark day and I will bring them out from the people and gather them from the countries and we'll bring them to their own land and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers and all the inhabited places of the country I will feed them in the good pasture and upon high places of Israel's of Israel Shadow Phoebe there shall they lie in a good fold and in a fat pasture so they feed upon the mountains of Israel I will feed my flock and I will cause them to lie down saith the Lord God I will seek that which was lost and bring again that which was driven away and will bind up that which was broken and will strengthen that which was sick but I will destroy the fat and the strong the world and I will feed them with judgment did you hear the promises of your Shepherd I'm going to bring them back they're my people inspired is Andrew let's see that I'll bring you back home again do you bear the same Mark as a shepherd I've been in a dark Valley do you see the light Hallelujah I wonder
