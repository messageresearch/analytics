TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hello everyone we are the team ministry here at the evening light tabernacle and we're glad that you joined with us again today and we are going to be discussing again the Word of God and we would love for you to join with us for a while as we talk about the good things of the Lord we were speaking in our last session when we started referring to some of the questions that were asked in Matthew chapter 24 when shall these things be and what is the sign of your coming and the end of the world and so actually Jesus would answer those three questions in that chapter and so however you know as we're looking at the sign of is coming and the end of the world I think there is a key word that comes that goes with the coming of the Lord and it's something says watch don't you think that's key today to be have a readiness you know and Jesus wanted us to have a state of being watching and waiting and looking and anticipating for his return I think when you take that word watch then you go back to the Greek - it actually means to be village'll and it also means to be watchful and to keep awake so he's telling us you need to keep awake right this is not a watch that you watch one time but it's to be vigilant about watching watching for what is coming you know stay awake don't be drifted asleep and put to sleep in the slumber of Laodicea and the lukewarm is's here but to await to be watchful - to expect his coming if every I would see him at his coming why would he continually emphasize watch watch watch as we are discussing in our last session that people misunderstand the third coming and the second coming because in the third coming which is revelations 19 it says every eye will see him and and that the world would seem and there would be a cataclysmic event but many people place that at the second coming with planes fall now the skies and train wrecks and people and just utter chaos and turmoil but that ain't the case the second coming Jesus comes like a thief in the night and so his emphasis and the sign of his coming and the end time events is watch watch because there are going to be people that are gonna miss it right give strict attention to yes when you do that you're watching the scriptures and the pattern of the scriptures to see how he's coming and when he's expecting this calm so it's you constantly given the attention that is needed not just looking in the skies waiting for him to park the skies giving the attention here in the word to see where the word says he's coming in what forms and what times and what they ultimate coming which is when he comes back with as bright as we alluded to in a previous session yes I think this watch is speaking of more than just your to physical absolutely absolutely because you know your planes falling out of skies I mean yeah that's easy to see with these two eyes but there's some people that's been given eyes to see house for us see the promises of God and see the things of God and be able to pick up signs there it is just like they did you know when Jesus came the first time there was some people there that could pick it up and say hey that's that's the handsomest size this one just as they've won the Jews when you see these things happening if you're on the rooftop go not you know don't go back down there were people in those days that could see because they were watching for those things to come to pass right and I believe that we enter in a generation where the signs of his coming are everywhere the signs yes relation or everywhere and yet people are going along not seeing it because they're not watching through the eyes of the Scriptures the Pharisees came to Jesus and said show us a sign and Jesus said you can tell the sign of fair weather coming or storm coming you can you can judge by the signs of the sky he said what you can't tell the signs of the day that they were living they were missing it altogether and I believe that's exactly the watching is looking for the sign of his appearing the signs of his coming the endtime conditions and the things that he told us to look for you know and it's amazing how many people want to try to say they got a certain date what's gonna happen at a certain time certain months certain day I mean what do you say to that well you know there's been a lot of mistakes that have been made even Billy Graham back in the 50s made a statement I believe the Lord will come this year and of course he learned not to make those type of predictions and I think you know we cannot look back and see many many others who gathered in the houses or underground places or this or quit their jobs and then looking for the coming of the Lord I think I think though we can know big exactly because Jesus said it's in the hour you think not yea the Son of man coming so I you know so we know exactly when you come it'll be when many people aren't looking at expect so but you know that's the answer to those who have set dates because we cannot know the day or the hour I think that is part of the actually the Seventh Seal were in that silence that is spoke of that God holds some things silent and that is one thing that he keeps silent is the exact time of his coming however I do believe that we can see signs of his coming and that and we can see by those signs that we're in the season of his claim and this is true when in for the Bible said wouldn't when you see the fig tree putting forth this bud but it says and all the other trees so when you see a time of restoration so we see Israel the victory that is putting forth her buds and we see many many other things that's coming into restoration that we know that we're in the season of the coming of the Lord so we're in that day an hour and then we can look back and see patterns in the scriptures like the days of Noah the days of Sodom therefore we can look at different types and we can talk about those as you if you would like let's jump back just for a second though just to kind of clarify it says an hour that you think not so sour that what are they thinking if they're not looking for his appearing far as two masses because we're talking about the masses is gonna be it was not gonna have a see Christ because they had they don't have the love for his appearing and for they gonna miss his type in the scriptures misses appearing in description so what would you say would be the thinking of man when it says an hour that you think not with so many professing Christians are saying they're looking for his coming well I feel like that that that people are involved in religion and you know perhaps the the trappings of of the society of the church rather than making really ready for the coming of the Lord and so they're unprepared you see the the brightness to be as one adorned for her husband she is ready for the wedding she's ready for the marries she's prepared for the coming of the Lord and so much like the Pharisees and Sadducees of their day they were so concerned with their programs and their agenda and when they're very massaged that their I mean Jesus Christ Himself the Son of God was right there in flesh and they didn't even know who he was yeah you know the the Sadducees were too interested in holding on to their power right the priesthood and you know their favor with the Roman and so on and rather than looking for the Messiah and searching the Scriptures and and to they had made the traditions out of this and so and so their traditions actually would make the Word of God to them of none effect you feel like that may be a stumbling block in this hour that we're living in with the systems around us and they're pushing their agenda or pushing their programs and what they can do for the family versus what the work can do for the family what an absolutely another thing is they've made it we reuse the term easy believe ISM to where there's no life that has to go with this profession so it's just once they profess okay Jesus is my Savior there's nothing to back that up or follow that up and they just go about the cares of everyday life and because they're not seeking a closer walk because they're not watching because they've been taught that's all you have to do yeah and so they're very teachings or traditions have led them to a state to where they're not prepared for the coming of the Lord hence the hour you think not because they're not really looking for it and I think today the majority of Christians day they may give some type of agreement yeah that Jesus is coming soon or whatever but really they're not looking for his coming they're not living like they're longing for his coming right also the Hauer like we've been talking about how're they think not I mean they're thinking it's gonna be planes crashing right gonna be train yeah going down Brooks blowing open that's the hour they're looking for right but he's gonna come when they don't come looking for him that's exactly yeah well I think if we go back to Matthew chapter 25 that we were speaking about in our past session or there's a wise virgin then the foolish virgin yeah well you know both them had professions yeah they all had they all had lamps they they all were waiting they were all looking for the bridegroom but the wise had oil in their vessels with their lamps yes so one had through baptism of the holy spirit while the other just had professions of faith yeah in all were virgins so they lived a high moral order yeah but in the Bible a woman always types at the church the the female the there's a scripture in 2nd Corinthians 11:2 Paul says I'm jealous over you with a godly jealousy for I've espoused you to one husband that I may present you a chaste virgin to Christ and and there's a another scripture that says that this is a great mystery concerning Christ in his church as as a woman marries a man and that man is her head so Christ marries the church so these these five are these 10 virgins representing women it's it's representing the church and then there's two groups there's two classes in here just as you described there are five that had oil in their lamps there were five that didn't have oil and their vessels their vessels typing the heart the receiving of God the place where the Holy Spirit would be filled and so there was a group that missed the rapture yeah and Jesus is carrying on now in Matthew 25 Matthew 24 he's saying watch watch watch and then he in Matthew 25 he follows that warning with this parable showing that there would actually be two classes within what is called the church right one group that would go and one group that would be left behind in weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth or otherwise the tribulation Great Tribulation that word virgin there means a woman of marriageable or a marriage above main so they're looking for to be exposed yes fine decent two different sections of ladies are virgins willing and ready to be married but one has what it's taken prepared herself to be married the other one has not so let's come back to this and and I have a question will will the Bride of Christ go through the tribulation absolutely not though there's a lot of confusion on the subject because people have different standpoints ministers would disagree and many are confused about the events there was a a man by the name of Bohannon mr. Bohannon once that talked to a minister and he said something a little sacrilegious he said John must have ate a red-pepper dinner that night when he when he wrote the book of Revelation which was very sacrilegious to speak against the Word of God like that the Minister rebuked him and said you know you ought to fear the Lord does talk like that he goes I just can't understand it he said I brought it to my preacher and he can't understand it he said there's the 144,000 and he was thinking that the hundred and forty-four thousand was the bride and he was getting it all mixed up standing on Mount Zion and what he failed to see was that the hundred and forty-four thousand are the Jews and that there is the the bride who already went in the rapture and then the remnant of the woman's seed that was left behind in the Tribulation Period so if we don't get the symbols of the book of Revelation right and the prophecies right then we got a cow up in a tree picking grass we've got the picture of redemption completely messed up altogether but but if we properly and rightfully divide the word of truth then we can see exactly every part has its place and that there is there is a group that is leaving before the tribulation the bride will not go through the tribulation period and we can talk about why it won't go through the tribulation period there is a group that is going through the tribulation period and then there's a hundred and forty-four thousand the elect the Bride of Christ is the elect of God that escapes the tribulation and she will judge the earth Paul said no you know that the Saints will judge the earth the Book of Daniel we see the Ancient of Days and he sets the Thrones down and the books are open and tens thousands times thousands ministered to him and then ten thousands times thousands stand before him the bride is not the one standing before you right the bride is sitting in the throne with him judging the nation but there there is also two resurrections right as a first resurrection in a second resurrection which we can discuss mm-hmm well and of course you know the the bride does not go through the tribulation is because she has already been judged in Christ's right because he would present himself a church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but one that is holy and without blemish yes so because of that then we do not go through the judgment of the tribulation I think this is typed also with Enoch and Noah you have Enoch who walked with God it was not yes no we had the first we had the first not an astronaut in space but it was not yeah and that was Enoch yes and then it was not because he you know God took him so he was raptured but then we have the Noah who was the type of the tribulation Saints especially the Jewish remnant who actually go through the tribulation over into the Millennium so you have one goes up and one goes through yes so you have to watch your types in the scripture yes because it is actually prophecy and of what really will happen in the end time how how could the bride go to the judgment when she has already been judged like you just said Jesus made this comment be perfect is my father in heaven is perfect now that was not a figure of speech right and obviously there is a road to perfection or he wouldn't have told us to be perfect and so how can a man be perfect yeah that's a pretty tall tall that was a tall order and not just a perfect in the eyes of man but as the Father in heaven is perfect yeah this is a tall order there's only one way we could stand in that kind of perfection and the Bible said Jesus became our sin that we might become the righteousness of God the only way we could ever stand in the perfection of God is to stand in Christ that means the judgments that fell upon Christ does not belong to us because he took them and that's why he said by one sacrifice he is sanctified and perfected forever them that are sanctified rather by one sacrifice he's perfected forever them that are sanctified so it is a blood offering it is the offering a Christ that brings us to the state of perfection and the Bible said if any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away all things are made new she shall not come into the condemnation but she is passed from death unto life amen what a wonderful promise that is to us that we can look forward to a rapture a people who have been made spotless by the blood of the Lamb and will be taken out before the judgment we want to talk about this more when we come back to our next session god bless you folks for listening today and we look forward to again to see you in the near future thank you for joining the ministry team at evening light tabernacle for more information on what you have heard today please visit us at evening light net may god bless you you
