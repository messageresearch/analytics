ask Lord that you would just move and touch all the different ones we pray we commit them into your hands Lord bless this service with your presence we ask it in Jesus name [Music] amen amen let's turn to Matthew chapter 3 verse 13 amen says then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me and Jesus answered unto him saying suffer it to be now so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness and then he suffered him and Jesus when he was baptized went straight way out of the water and lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighten upon him and L a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased amen God bless you can be seated just want to take a moment to thank I'm sure brother Tim will as well on on Sunday uh we got quite a few that's out tonight and sick and different reasons but you know we we uh We Don't Preach to crowds we preach to Children Of God so it does not matter how many we have here amen it matters that where two or three are gathered there'll here be amen but we want to thank everyone that was involved in the camp you know if you just came down there with your amens we appreciate that and but for every effort you know to make it I believe it was another successful camp and so you know all the sound and video team the musicians the gator Patrol Those that could could be counselors and you know even like I said those that were unseen and maybe nobody saw what you did but thank you anyhow and we sure appreciate it it was a great camp and I believe it had a great outcome I believe we ended up baptizing four souls but U then one went home to be baptized but there was many that were touched amen including myself and I'm thankful for that and but it could not have happened you know without everyone involved and you know I'd like to say you are the best and we we sure appreciate you for that uh we heard some wonderful Services preached you know by brother Ron and brother Danny and brother Andrew and I thought they were just everyone tremendous and on point and and uh had their different ways of doing things and it just worked out perfectly and we sure enjoyed that but God bless each and every one of you for every effort both great and small amen also uh like to say happy birthday to my wife sister Ruth it's her birthday today and amen thankful for her and and of course we get to have a little time with Adrian and Ben as well that followed us home after camp and be going home next week and it's uh good to be with your family amen you don't ever want to take those times for granted amen so we're thankful for that we also have brother Leo here with us from China and and his wife I believe yes and so so glad to have them with us first time I met brother Leo was was in China I believe and he was my translators for several services and took us around and we really appreciate him and and the spirit that he works with amen I I believe it's the spirit of God you know it's kindred spirits and wasn't very hard to get to know him and and to work with him and we sure appreciate him in all that he does Amen tonight I'd like to speak to you on faith to fulfill I I believe that we're in the time of fulfillment of all things and and and and there has to be somebody there to fulfill the scriptures that are written about this day now you know I know we we look at all the other examples in the Bible and those that fulfill Jesus himself would fulfill scriptures but we also have scriptures to fulfill amen the critics have scriptures to fulfill amen those who uh uh uh like Judas would go and and and and do what what he did There's also those that have to fulfill those scriptures and and and you know as we read this as Jesus is coming to be baptized John was like wait a minute you know I shouldn't be baptizing you but you should be baptizing me and Jesus said no suffer it to be so for it becometh us or it is in other words it is fitting or it is proper or it is the right thing to do to fulfill uh to bring to completion or reality something that's desired or promised and a and to fulfill all righteousness and brother Brandon would talk about this many times about the righteousness he is speaking of was the word of God Amen to fulfill the word of God that was spoken of him amen as a as a priest that would have to be washed before he could go into service and and he had to fulfill that part and you know and you can look like I said through the scriptures about even Abraham you know when in Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 13 it said when God made a promise to Abraham because he was could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiply it I will multiply thee but after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise so it wasn't just something that was easy or something that was uh you know just a walk in the park but he had to endure things before he was able to obtain the promise and we we know his life story we've went through it many times been preached about many times that it wasn't just the first day or the first year or the first 10 years that it took place but it took place in his life because he had Faith to fulfill what was spoken of him amen and he held on to it and he he he walked with it he he kept on as at at what God had promised him and I I believe that God also has a people in this day that has that same same kind of Faith amen you wonder why people can continue on like they're walk like like they're going because God has deposited that faith on the inside of us by the Holy Spirit and and that's what gives us the faith Amen to stand in the day that we're living in to stand in the day of critics to stand in the day of naysayers or name callers to stand in the middle of all of it is because God has put a deposit of faith on the inside of us to believe what has been spoken of us now there's many in this time that we're living in that's walking away from the faith as the scripture talks about the falling away that would take place and they're fulfilling the scripture that is spoken of them but amen I believe that I I'm I'm not talking to a people that's that's fulfilling that scripture but they're fulfilling the scripture of the Rapture they're fulfilling the scripture of the body chains they're fulfilling the scripture amen that spoken in the about the leoan church age of uh there are those that are filling the naked and blind and don't know it but there's also those that are accepting the eyes s of the word and and the eyes myself of God to be able to see things Amen to be able to O be an overcomer in this day and and I I believe that's who I'm speaking to tonight amen you know I I was looking at this and I ran across this again and it's a wonderful uh uh uh um thing in the in the church age book of of pick up my pen and write and brother brand talks about this and he he writes this all out and he says here he was one night seeking the Lord and the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write and I grabbed a pen and wrote begin to write and the spirit gave me a a message for the church and I want to bring it to you so amen it's for us amen that God would would anoint the prophet to write these things down he says here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is in each species brings forth of its own kind even according to Genesis 1:1 God said let the Earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind who seeds in itself upon the Earth and it was so whatever life was in the seed came forth in the plant then into the fruit and the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church it will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is of that seed in these last days the true bride Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be a super Church a super race as she nears him they and the bride will be so much like him that they will be in his very image amen this is an order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations can't produce this wrong seed they will produce their Creeds and their dogmas and mixed with the word this mongolz and brings forth a hybrid product but he said the first son Adam was a was a spoken word seed of God and and he was given a bride to reproduce himself and that's why the bride was given him to re reproduce and and to produce another son and he goes through and he speaks about how the serpent got to her before he did but he he then he comes all the way over to Mary and he say then the word came to the promise of of Mary the Virgin and and that word that was promised was he himself was to be made manifest God was to be made manifest acted at that time and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in the Virgin it is the angel that brought it but it's the Angel's message was the word of God it was what was spoken of him amen Isaiah 9:6 and he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted the word for her to be fulfilled in her and he said the members of the Virgin bride will love him they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subjects to him as members of our bodies are subject to our heads notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it first showed him by the father excuse me John 5:9 this harmony is now to exist between groom and his bride and he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death amen for if it it if the seed to be planted and the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this you ready for the secret the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ where she knows what he wants done with the word hallelujah she performs the command of the word in his and his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted in water it comes to full Harvest serving his purpose those in the bride do only his will none no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep Still They Know that it was has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling the word he did not complete all the work while he was here in his Earthly Ministry so now he's working in and through a bride Hallelujah she knows that for it is she knows that for it is not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do amen but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific spefic time amen so he couldn't fulfill all the scripture in Groom form amen he had some of the scripture that had to be fulfilled in Bride form amen that the bride had to fulfill it amen it wasn't a tape that was going to fulfill it it wasn't one man that was going to fulfill it it was the bride that was going to fulfill it amen and nothing can make her do anything else I I like that statement because what that tells me the devil can't make me do anything amen because because the word has been deposited inside of me by the holy spirit amen and is moving inside my life and it's giv me Faith to stand no matter what I'm going through no matter what trials I'm in no matter what sickness I'm in no matter what trouble I'm in I have faith to believe the word of God hallelujah amen and my faith is not dependent upon whether things are good or not or whether there's money in the bank or not or whether I'm well or not or whether I feel good or not it has nothing to do with that my faith is depending upon what his word said and my faith is standing upon the word that word that will never pass away amen your feelings will pass away you'll have good feelings one day and they'll pass away and there'll be bad feelings the next day then they'll pass away and you'll have good feelings another day amen but the word of God will not pass away it will stand there no matter if you feel it if you see it if anything's everything's around you cloudy and dismal and dull it has nothing to do with it his word is still there his word is still declaring amen I am the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah it doesn't matter what we're going through I that's why I love that song sister amen sister lar saying amen I've never walked alone he's always been what gives me Faith to continue to walk why how why can I have this Faith cuz I am not walking alone amen I am not by myself you are not by yourself you've been through a lot of Trials you've been through a lot of problems but never one time have you been through one sickness without him never one time have you been through one trial without him never one time have you been in one battle without him he is there why can I say that cuz his word says he is that's why we're not concerned about whether we got a full church or a half empty church it matters long as we got one or two people that come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said I will be there amen it has nothing to do with me it has to do with his word and he will fulfill his word Jesus said search the scriptures you think you have eternal life you believe in God believe also in me if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me but if I do the works I am a father one when you see me you have seen the father he said says when you see the word made manifest you see the father because the word is the Father the word is God the word made manifest is God himself taking his word and making it manifest among Believers and nothing can make the word live but Believers hello somebody none can make the word live make it live but Believers just Believers just Believers amen amen you know as we heard this past weekend God is looking for a body to borrow I enjoyed that I don't know about you amen as we heard he's looking for a body to borrow for what to fulfill his word amen he's looking for someone who believes why and has Faith why to fulfill his word amen you know why did he allow Sinners to whip him because he had the fulfill the word why did he allow them to hit him on the cheek and he opened not his mouth cuz he was doing doing it to fulfill the word why did he go to the Cross cuz he was doing it to fulfill the word how many times you read the New Testament and the gospels and he said he done this so that Isa what Isaiah had spoken had come to pass be fulfilled amen why did he go to the Cross why did he lay in a bar tomb why did he rise on the third day why did he Ascend because he had to fulfill the word why did he send back his spirit so he would have the S have someone with the same Faith to fulfill every word spoke of them remember if God has a work for you to do all the Demons of Hell cannot take you we said we we we've seen that in Ron Spencer's life I mean goodness if the devil could have took him he'd have took him at Youth Camp or in the middle of something you know he can't do it unless God's through unless the Fulfillment is taking place amen they they can't they just can't startle you in any way God has got a purpose for the Holy Ghost Church how many's part of that Holy Ghost Church God's got a purpose for the Holy Ghost Church and all the devils and hell will never be able to take it away Hallelujah cuz there has to be a word to fulfill him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne he could not say that unless there was somebody to fulfill that he could not declare it unless he knew there's going to be somebody in the leot and church age that's going to overcome Leo deia that's going to overcome her lukewarmness going to overcome her unbelief and all the things about her and going to rise up above it and overcome he could not declare it unless he knew somebody is going to fulfill it and he's not here in a man body to fulfill it he's in a bride body amen we know that all the devils in hell will never be able to take it away God got a purpose for it it'll never be destroyed until God lets us fulfill the purpose he's ordained it to do and it will you see Jesus Christ so we have the spirit of Christ right what the holy spirit is the spirit of Christ so if we have the spirit of Christ then we must have the same attributes amen right have the same attributes Jesus Christ no matter if he was in the storm or a gale and it was knocking the boat from one side to the other or he was standing in the face of a mess of demons if if he if he was hanging they was hanging everywhere it never moved him it never moved him he walked right on just as calm and quiet as he could be he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him amen whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knew it was going to happen because God said it was going to happen he didn't say oh I pray have I prayed through wonder if I fasted long enough wonder if I did this enough he just walked right on and CAU that's right he believed what God had said that was a truth the words must be fulfilled and he knew what his life was sent here for was to fulfill the word spoken of him and you are here to fulfill it too so if we got we understand the word spoke of me and what do you got to fear the word said I was going to overcome so what do you got to fear amen you know brother brand actually brother brother Eddie excuse me Eddie bisc was telling about the the story of the blind man in India being healed and brother brandom I believe talked with him about it I've been listening to some found some of the testimony brother Ed just going through him and and he said he said he said you know he saw him this man was a worshiper of the son lost his eyes we know the story he said but he saw him standing there healed in a but he said I and he he said actually I believe it was if I remember the story and the details exactly right but he saw this man was dark-headed but he saw a man this man heal but he had gray up coming up his up his around his ears like that so obviously you know you'd think well that's down the road he said brother random said I had to use my faith to believe that was going to happen right now he had to believe it no matter what anybody said any critics whatever I'm sure you know the devil was whispering in his ear cuz he was making a challenge between before their gods and the Living God but he had to believe that it's going to happen right now Jesus also had to believe the word spoken about him because it when he talked about his body not being broken and Bones not it didn't say Jesus it didn't mention his name he just spoke about it but he had to believe that is talking about me it don't talk they don't say Timothy was an overcomer Le to se or air or Tim PR or whoever but we have to believe that is talking about me and I must have the faith to fulfill that word I tell you I just while I'm here I I was listening to him talking about the the vision being fulfilled of the the bear and the and the Carib and he was talking about how that how that he had you know told you know the story told his wife to throw that old green Checker shirt away and he he'd hear he' F fell in some water and went to go find something and he said I opened my bag and he said there was that he said there was that crazy shirt and he said I started grumbling like my wife don't even listen to me I told her to throw it away and I wanted a new shirt for this hun I I wanted you know he said I wanted a red one or something he said and here she just fixed it mended it all up and he said here I am grumbling while I'm fulfilling a vision he said here I am complaining while the vision's being fulfilled amen that's what happens to us many times we get in life do you realize you're fulfilling a vision what the word has spoken about you and meanwhile you Grumble and you complain you're like why am I going through all this why is this happening meanwhile you're f fulfilling a vision don't worry God's going to take care of it he's going to fulfill it and it's going to come to pass he'll go past your grumbling he'll go past your complaining cuz God's word will be fulfilled so we're here to fulfill it too so you walk unconscious of fear you walk unconscious of criticism that's a hard thing to do but walk unconscious of it walk unconscious to the world walk with Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right or the left hand just keep moving on if something comes up to the church walk with God Amen if sickness strikes you walk with God if your neighbor next to you hello somebody if your neighbor next to you says something about you walk with God keep walking with God any kept doing that until one day he walked all the way home I believe there's another people about to fulfill that scripture amen walk with God doctor says you're not going to you're going to die walk with God Amen doctor says you can't get well walk with God just walk with him God has promised you I'll never leave you or forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world he took an oath by the Covenant he gave you and he will confirm it just walk with God he says you'll have your ups and downs don't worry you'll go through your Brier patches and your sharp rocks and Bluffs and down over hillsides and up a mountain and over Waters but every step walk with God there's many Hills to climb upward you heard the old song but how little it seem when you get to the end of the way woo hallelujah how little is everything we've been through going to seem to us when we step into that new body well I can tell you how little Satan's going to look when we step into that new body he has no more no more power to give us a mind battle or any disease and he's going to look so little we're going to narrowly look down on him and say this is the one this is the one that caused me to stay throw up my hand say I quit come on I was I was going to quit and I was going to give up but something rose up on the inside of me and said you can't quit you can't give up you got to take another step and you keep walking this is the one that made me say the things I said and do the things that I done this is the one why he's going to look so little we're talking about the chief we're talking about the the the general of of the Satan Lucifer himself we're not talking about some little weak spirit that you can just tell you know to go and he goes there's different Legions there's different Tri tries we know that by the scripture we know that by the message of the hour we're talking about the man himself we're talking about the chief devil in charge we're talking about the greatest of the greatest of their tribe we're talking about the one who wears the headdress makes all the rules and tells every other devil what to do we're going to look at him and we're going to say this is the one we're going to have a laughing party we're going to have a rejoicing party amen when we see him kicked over into hell never to be no more we this was the one it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness in in other words it must be fulfilled he cannot allow one jot or one turle to not be fulfilled or otherwise he's told a lie God doesn't lie now man will make God lie I've heard many men or many women say God told me this and God told me that never come to pass they God's the biggest liar if you listen to men and women but if you listen to his word he don't lie that's amen it must be fulfilled all the word that God is spoken it must be fulfilled God cannot say anything somebody say anything anything without having it fulfill when he spoke it's a finished work it's already finished when God speaks it so take courage tonight ladies and gentlemen he said to him that overcometh it's finished it's as good as finished somebody's going to take that scripture somebody's going to be that one somebody or two or three or 100 or 100 th000 whatever it is amen somebody's going to become that cuz it won't go unfulfilled it's already finished God never speaks until he's ready for it to be when he speaks it's just as well has already happened amen if it wouldn't give us he said now if that wouldn't give us a basis to put our faith on this morning when God speaks a word it's finished he said why he said when he came 2,000 years ago he said why did he heal he said he healed not to show his power he healed to fulfill his word amen he's saved not to show his power he's saved to fulfill his word amen see God is concerned amen not so much about displaying his power but when his word is made manifest it will display his power amen it'll heal it'll deliver it'll set free it'll do all kinds of things but God cannot say anything without it being finished every one of us mortal men mortal women we can all say something we probably said it already down in our life and we ain't finished it [Music] yet yeah that was the truth yeah I got some things I ain't finished we all do God has some things that ain't finished but they will be you may not ever finish what you got going on or what you want to do or whatever but God will God's going to finish every part I I'm trying to drive that home because he's going to finish this bride he's not going to fall off at the end and and you know leave her here and oh well I couldn't get you out of here so you just got to go through the tribulation no God's going to get her out of here cuz he promised he would he it's written there so he has to do it or he's not God everything he said he will finish therefore when we receive the L word into our heart it's already done it's completed amen it's finished that's why when he said he said if this doesn't answer the question if that's why he then said be baptized many he said well why he was baptized because he was our example that's true in a certain State certain place true but that ain't all that wasn't all to the truth of it was he was the antitype now I looked up the definition of the antitype something serving as a model for what comes later so he came as an antitype amen showing that there's going to be more of me doing exactly what I'm doing coming later if I stay here as one man that's not my desire I have words to be fulfilled amen I have sayings to be filled I have I have something to be fulfilled in other lives and other people it can't just be in me therefore I must go that the comforter can come back and fill you with the faith to finish the word and this is where Peter was he couldn't finish it in his own self he tried he with all of his his grit and his tenacity that he had amen I'm going to do it I'm going to finish it I'm going to be the one I'll not go I'll go with you all the way he said you go before the crows three times you'll deny me before the crows through once you'll deny me Thrice no I ain't going to deny you ain't going to happen he spoke it Peter I'm sorry it's got to be fulfilled all your best intentions all you wanted all your flly desires you try to do everything you could you took a sword and I promise you he wasn't aiming for no ear not Peter he's going to take his head off cuz he's the man he's the leader but that wasn't way God wanted things he didn't want us to be leading by our fleshly desires and our wants no matter how good some of the attributes of our flesh can be that's not where he wants us to be led he wants us to be led by the spirit that's right let the spirit lead as it led him amen and so here he comes and he and he denies Christ and and he no doubt worded and like man I done did it now but when he when God when Jesus rose again he said go tell my disciples and Peter and he calls them all together amen he said because I need you to be in a place because I'm going to come back again not as who you see but as a spirit of God and I'm going to Endo you with power I'm going to Endo you with Faith from on high the same faith that got me to the Garden it got me through the garden they got Me to the Cross they got me to the Grave they got me out of the Grave I'm going to give you that same Faith to fulfill the word of God so he's the antitype he was the high priest that could be that before he could be anointed he had to be washed and we can go through it in air and how they had to wash him and then they could anoint him with the oil and will save time but here he was the very type of he said then he said even types the priest of the day we must be first baptized confess our sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ washing away our sins washing away all the old man going down a dead man and coming back up alive Hallelujah that we might receive this anointing the gift of the Holy Ghost wash first then anointing for service so he was showing us what it was to be amen and he was to fulfill all righteousness amen that righteousness was his word and and and he goes on he says see John you know who I am I'm the high priest that's true John I need to be baptized of thee you got to ful we got to fulfill our righteousness I need to be baptized of thee so I can fulfill the word of God because all the word has to be fulfilled all right we are and he said therefore we are also the lights of this day and it's up to us to fulfill all that's written of this day why do you think the devil's been after you because he's trying to make the word of no effect let just one drop fall to the ground one dot one tit that's what he's trying to do but he's not going to be successful because there's going to be some people that's going to fulfill the word amen he said the light of every age should do the same thing thing we know what is to be fulfilled You Are Spiritual and know the word of God you see what God has promised and the word will not come to pass just easy it won't be just easy amen you got but he said but you got to press your way into it to do it sometimes see it behooveth us it becometh us to fulfill all God's righteousness we must do it and he said if the Church of the Living God could only get that in their hearts and into their heads and their hearts that the church will not be separated by some denominational barrier that differences in Creeds and colors and so forth but that we might come together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not having anything to Bear us away from the true word of the Living God and walk straight down the line of scripture to fulfill all of God's righteousness of today why did Noah build an ark because it becometh him to fulfill feel he heard the word of God therefore he was commissioned to build an ark and he had to do what God's word said no matter how crazy it sounded how Wild it sounded how it was against science and everything that they had and all the stuff and the knowledge that they had he knew the plan of God and he was going to fulfill it because there was something on the inside of him to fulfill the word amen he got past all the education and all of his thoughts and all of his ideas and he started hammering on this Arc sure critics come cuz they had to fulfill their part that's why we have critics they have to fulfill the part we must pass through the Hall of critics they have to fulfill their part it's I mean I ain't trying to put anybody in the Hall of a Critic being a Critic they just are who they are just like Judas was who he was amen but Peter was also just who he was you are also just who you are amen you're fulfilling it why amen because God's word will come to pass and this is where he was this is where he was at he says brother you know he said he said we look at this and he said we know what we have we that are born again of the holy spirit of God we see his works right among us just like it was in the Bible times if you believe in that same Holy Spirit then why isn't he doing the same thing in your church well that's just a bunch of I'm just reading quote here it's just a bunch of mental workup it's just a bunch of emotion it it we can prove that that ain't really what it is no matter what scientific proofs are they can prove is just emotional quote that we're just mentally upet that there's really nothing to this great religion of ours it's just a bun just it's just what it's just what it is so forth like that we're just a bunch of outcast don't believe it that's a quote don't believe it no matter what anybody says what any Theologian doctor science teacher you hold on to the word of God remember as Noah was building an ark we are also building an ark but this Ark is not for the tribulation that's right this Ark is for a Rapture and no matter how much they say there's no such a thing as a baptism of the Holy Spirit there's no such a thing as Divine Healing it behooveth us it may not behoove you it behoveth me it behooveth us amen it's becoming to us hallelujah it's becoming to us to fulfill righteousness it might not be becoming to you it might be embarrassing to you it might be uh you a way out there somewhere for you but to me it's becoming to me it's becoming to me to see the word of God preach and the people of God rejoice in it it's becoming to me to see the spirit of God fall and our young people get drunk on the spirit of God it might not be becoming to you but it's becoming to me amen amen you know when you say that see somebody dressed up right well that's becoming on you it looks good on them that's right it makes them look good it makes them it makes them look the part it makes them as brother Donnie talked about dressed the part it makes becoming on them it don't look bad it looks good come on little bride of Jesus Christ it's becoming to you to be dressed in the word of God it's becoming to you to be dressed in holiness and righteousness and the power of the holy spirit is becoming to you amen for the spirit of God to fall and you lift your hands up and rejoice and praise God it's becoming to you to see the scripture fulfill before your eyes and you can't hold yourself no longer and you say thank you Jesus praise God I see it it's becoming to you Mom and Dad when you see your family being filled with the Holy Ghost that you also begin to rejoice may not be becoming to others but it's becoming to me well there's no such a thing as Divine Healing it that may not be becoming to you but it's becoming to me it behooveth us to fulfill all righteousness no matter what critics say hello no matter what critics say maybe I'll just Dro this in some of you may have seen in the prayer line where ministered started ministering to me Lord knows I needed it going through some things in my life and situations some up with sister Ruth and her her issues that has been we've been dealing with for now about a year and um and you know Myriad of other things the devil wants to sit on you start squeezing the breath out of your life feels like you can't do nothing and you know everything's messed up and yeah you're up here preaching Faith but don't necessarily feel all that Faith but you're preaching it anyhow because it's the word of God it ain't I We Don't Preach things because we feel it all the time sure there's times you get up oh man I can't but you know a lot of times when you're back there all wo you come out here it goes it's a fact then back there you're like man I don't know I don't know how this is going to go cuz it has nothing to do with you it has to do with him amen but through those prayers brother Andrew brother Ron amen the spirits of criticism and things that try to sit on you and and try to push you down and try to hold you down and say things about you and you hear about this and you hear he about that and they call you this and they call you that it weighs on you even though you try to push it off and even though you don't try to grab the the old spear like d you know David got Spears throwed at him all the time I I want to be a David I don't want to grab the spear and throw it back even if they are backslid and saw I'm just saying what it is amen they want to throw Spears that shows who you are but I ain't going to throw it back I'm just going to keep playing I'm going to keep worshiping God I'm going to keep giving God Glory cuz it's becoming to me amen because I've been in the battle with a lion and I've been in the battle with with a bear and I've been in the battle with Goliath you might get jealous about David killing his 10,000 and you only killed a thousand but why don't you grab a sword and start killing some devils and now start adding up a little bit amen but come on it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness those critics he said remember it's becoming to them to fulfill that because that also must be fulfilled but the word will remain the same when they're all gone Hallelujah and even churches will be no more God's word will ever remain the same and it becometh us to fulfill that righteousness amen so we must have the faith to fulfill it Noah it bothered him not he went right ahead with him because he knew God's program he knew what God was going to do he knew God's layout because he talked to God and it was according to the word of God he went right on done it anyhow whether science or criticism could prove otherwise matter not he stayed with God's word and he pounded right away why it was becoming of him to him because Noah was a prophet and it was it was ways becoming to him that he kept the word of God and he stayed with it it's becoming to any Prophet true prophet of God that he stays with the word and it's becoming to any Christian any Holy Ghost spirit filled Christian to stay with the word everything else may look easier it may look brighter and shinier this that and the other but beyond all of that stay with the word it's becoming to every Christian to Stand By God's word heavens and earth will pass away but it'll never pass away Enoch was a prophet Enoch knew that he was a type and he knew that before the floods came that he had to give an example so one afternoon it was becoming of him to take a walk it was becoming of him that he would take his walk with God and somehow that day he just changed path instead of going around that same side of the Hill he all of a sudden stepped on the King's Highway and he just kept on walking and they found him not why because it was becoming to him and he said oh God let me be like Enoch when the hour comes that I must take the path let me just step on to the King's Highway Hallelujah he said I can see Enoch as he knew it was becoming to him for he was a prophet and he knew what was going to happen he said see I can see him kiss his wife goodbye and say darling I'll see you later take up his children kiss them goodbye and go down to his marriage son his married daughter kissed him goodbye said where you going father you going out for a little walk yep just a little stroll but he never took that old familiar path that day he took the King's Highway and he went on to Glory it was becoming of him to do so he didn't want to leave but yet it was becoming of him to fulfill all righteousness because he was a type of the church today he was a type of the church that's going to take an afternoon stroll one of these days and one of these afternoons amen and they're going to strike the King's Highway and Away we'll go hallelujah hallelujah you don't know when that step's going to take you off of the path that you're on and the next step you're on the King's Highway in a new body yeah it was becoming to Noah it was becoming to Enoch it was becoming to Daniel we could go through a bunch of them you can go listen to this sermon it's qu I've been listening to it many times let me go there here they took their stand it was becoming to them that they remained in that stand when you come this morning believing that God is going to heal you and you take your stand it's becoming that you never testify anything contrary to it that's right if you don't feel like that you don't feel like that God would could heal you could heal you then stay away you're only direct quote that you're making a mock mockery out of but if you feel that when the altar call comes that I want to take my stand for Christ if you feel count the price count your men see if you're able to go into battle see if you're ready if you don't feel like you're ready don't come but if something tells you this is my day this is my morning then you come and ever remain there and don't you move it all no matter if death faces you and the fog is FL on your face what do you care anyhow stand there for heavens and earth will pass away and my words will never fail stay with it you say well I believe Jesus Christ is my healer I believe it this morning that he's going to heal my sick body something told me to come to church and I'm here amongst Believers I'm going to take my stand I believe it I'm going up there to be prayed for and when I'm prayed for that's where I'm that's the stand I'm going to remain no matter how dark it gets no matter where it's at I'll stand on that stand stand Hallelujah I'll stand on that stand you took the stand because why it's becoming to you and want you made the confession you must stay with your confession because it's behooving to you as a Christian as a Believer to stay with your conviction don't let the devil push you off here or there you're always mudded up you're always off the main road you're always in and out you're always where you can't stand nowhere you can't have confidence in yourself much less any body else you can't no one can have confidence in you either but you got to take a stand and when you made your stand you stand therefore because it's becoming to you behooving you to do so it's becoming up to us to fulfill all righteousness we have some musicians to come he said old brandom Tabernacle what what kind of word would we give on the day of judgment when we've seen his mighty hand we've seen his power we've watched his glory we've seen what he said and it never fails we've seen his person the great Pillar of Fire the light hanging in the room here we've seen it Yonder science has taking his picture we hear the message go forth right straight to the line separate yourself don't ass associate with the unbelief it's becoming us that we fulfill all righteousness Abraham professed he was a pilgrim and a stranger Angy he had nothing to do he knew nobody on Earth he walked with God because it was becoming to him for he had seen him it was becoming to Abraham for when all the kings are out there you know and make him this great big guy and all this Abraham would have got this great Victory and the Kings would have met him and all the domination of barriers and all the things that could have take place but it was becoming for to him for he knew that God swore him swore to him I'll give you everywhere you look East North West South what did difference does it make whether we got a nickel or a dime whether we got something to eat or whether we have it whether we live in or whether we die and God promised the meek shall inherit the earth it behooveth us it becometh us that we live like it act like it must fulfill our righteousness God wants men and women who will stand and fulfill our righteousness of course righteousness is his word as I said at the beginning of the sermon that sermon Jesus would baptize the reason Jesus was baptized no matter how it was if he claimed to be the Son of God then he was baptized for the remission of sins he had none but he had to be washed because he was a high priest he had to fulfill all righteousness suffer it so John we must fulfill it we must we must do it we must suffer this to be so what was he saying I know if I do this I may suffer I may go through hard times I know I will but I must fulfill the word of God he said then I'll take the way with the Lord's despised few it's becoming to me to do so it's becoming to you as Servants of God that we take the way with the Lord's despised few we walk Godly righteously holy in this present life laying aside every weight that so easily beset us looking to the author and the finisher of our faith Jesus Christ it was becoming Abraham when he walked up there talking about Isaac and he took him up there and God showed him that he was going to that he was Jehovah Gyra but it was becoming to Abraham to fulfill all righteousness he knew what he was talking about he knew his God he knew what God Said God is able to perform what God's made promise God has made God is able to bring to keep to bring to pass no matter what he said it's becoming it was becoming to the disciples to go to that Upper Room why it was becoming because they had met a man a carpenter known to the World by a bad name illegitimate yub but they had seen this man heal the sick raise the dead cleanse the leper go to the calvary go to a grave and rise again and they seen him Ascend and it was becoming to do what he said go to Jerusalem T there and I'll send you power from on high it was becoming how long until how long will it be Lord just until until you're endued with power from on high then you will be my witness how long will it last under this generation under that generation as many as the Lord Our God will call I love that so it's becoming to us to still believe in Mercy amen amen it may not be becoming to you but it's becoming to me to still believe in Mercy and Grace and God's mercy and Grace in this hour it was becoming to them they went to the upper room because they had seen this power displayed they knew that he died and dead and they saw him put in the grave and they saw the Rocks belch out and they saw all these things plac but they they knew he was Messiah they saw him was sined and they said we got to go where he said go now there was there was a group there that didn't well the scripture say about 500 that watched him sin there was only 120 in the upper room according to scripture so what happened to the rest of them 380 it wasn't be coming to them but those 120 caught a revelation they caught something on the inside to go there he said unto a man and woman experiences what was becoming to them the Holy Ghost then they'll know what they they're talking about and they'll and they'll know what they're living about and you'll know that you that it's not just excitement it's not just the power but it's the power of God into salvation it's the Holy Ghost I know what I'm speaking of it behooveth the it was behooving to the disciples it was becoming to them to go there and receive the Holy Ghost but it's also behooving to you Amen to receive the same power that they received so you can have the same faith that they received fulfilled they fulfilled their part amen throughout all the ages everyone fulfilled their part and now it's up to us it was behooving it was becoming it must be done it must happen it must take place he says becoming to us in this day we can stand we know we just been through the church ages we know we receed the holy ghost we know that beyond beyond the shadow of a doubt we know we have the Gospel Light repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus for the remission of your sin you shall

the Lord Our God shall call the prophet said in the light that it will be light in the evening time these gospel lights will be turned back again like same sun rising East sets in the west and to
