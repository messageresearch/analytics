[30:14] eyes today to understand eNOS to the
[30:16] power that we're living in
[30:18] lord I pray O God as we have this little
[30:21] reprieve and this little wake-up call
[30:24] this little moment Lord will weaken as a
[30:28] song would say Selah pause and think on
[30:32] this but we just stopped for a moment
[30:34] and think of where we're at in time as
[30:37] it blends over into eternity and make
[30:41] our way Lord toward the promise of God
[30:44] that is given for this age and this time
[30:46] we ask it in the name of Jesus amen amen
[30:52] god bless you thank you brothers for
[30:55] your your company today and coming out
[30:58] here on this kind of a stormy day but
[31:02] it's Easter amen and we're here to honor
[31:05] the resurrection of our Lord Jesus I
[31:08] trust wherever you are that you are
[31:10] under the blessings of God and already
[31:14] as we have sung the great songs of Zion
[31:17] and hearing Adrianna's sing a moment ago
[31:20] you know daughters of Zion Abraham's
[31:23] sons hear the word of your father
[31:26] amen I hear your promise of love it's
[31:29] it's our hour it's our time to hear our
[31:32] promise and God is calling us to
[31:34] attention in this hour and I think it is
[31:38] a wonderful time that we're in I'm
[31:40] thankful for this time just forever
[31:43] everyone to make their call in an
[31:45] election sure to draw nigh to God as we
[31:49] procrastinate I'm prophecies being
[31:53] fulfilled this year things are very
[31:56] different due to the circumstances that
[31:59] are beyond our control as you know we're
[32:02] not having youth camp although we want
[32:05] to thank brother Michael Dexter and his
[32:07] team for the virtual youth camp that we
[32:09] had where we have everyday play back
[32:13] some of the services past and in case
[32:18] you were a part of that well today is
[32:20] the climax service of that so um his son
[32:24] it's not quite sunrise service but it is
[32:28] Easter morning and for 33 years now I've
[32:30] not had a
[32:31] for service at our church but here we
[32:36] are today and it's Easter and this is a
[32:39] resurrection kind of all of its own it's
[32:42] I guess sad been 33 years since I'm
[32:45] priest and Easter
[32:47] due to hosting the youths in Louisiana
[32:49] youth camp and this would have been our
[32:51] 34th camp I think and so but due to the
[32:57] situation's is going on worldwide that
[33:00] we're not able to have the youth camp
[33:01] this year but we still have it and we
[33:04] were blessed and the Holy Spirit moved
[33:07] in hearts that were hungry for God amen
[33:11] I'd like to turn to mark chapter 16 and
[33:14] verse 1 and as you're looking that for
[33:19] that scripture mark 16 verse 1 I think
[33:24] about this being that we started the
[33:27] youth camp in 1987 and I not had a an
[33:31] actual Easter service in our church
[33:34] since then and meant the the last one
[33:38] that we had was in her old wooden
[33:40] building way back there long before we
[33:45] built the the other one in 1990
[33:49] dedicated in 1996 and so we never had an
[33:53] Easter service that I ministered in in
[33:58] those years and the in the other church
[34:02] after the old beldam that we met in so
[34:05] this would be the first Easter service
[34:08] we've had in the new church amen I
[34:10] welcome you to be a part of this today
[34:12] as we deserve the Word of God and and
[34:16] turning with me to March 16 verse 1 and
[34:19] when the Sabbath was passed Mary
[34:22] Magdalene and Mary the mother of James
[34:26] and Salome had brought sweet spices that
[34:29] they might come and anoint him and very
[34:32] early in the morning the first day of
[34:34] the week they came unto the sepulchre at
[34:37] the rising of the Sun and they said
[34:41] among themselves who shall
[34:44] away the stone from the door of the
[34:46] sepulchre and when they look they saw
[34:50] that the stone was rolled away for it
[34:53] was very great and entering into the
[34:56] sepulchre they saw a young man sitting
[34:59] on the right side clothed with a long
[35:02] garment and they were affrighted and he
[35:06] said unto them be not a frightened you
[35:08] seek Jesus of Nazareth which was
[35:11] crucified
[35:12] He is risen he is not here behold the
[35:16] place where they laid him but go your
[35:19] way tell his disciples and Peter that he
[35:23] goeth before you into Galilee and there
[35:26] shall you see him as he said unto you
[35:29] and they went quickly and fled from the
[35:32] sepulchre for they trembled and were
[35:34] amazed neither said they anything to any
[35:37] man for they were afraid and when Jesus
[35:39] was risen early on the first day of the
[35:42] week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene
[35:45] out of whom he had cast Seven Devils god
[35:48] bless you gonna let you have your seats
[35:51] now but I will have several more
[35:53] Scripture readings that I would like to
[35:55] share this morning Joel chapter 2 and
[35:59] verse 21 I think this is very pertinent
[36:02] to this time and to this moment because
[36:06] he says fear not notice these were the
[36:09] same words that the angel said don't be
[36:13] a frightened fear not o öland be glad
[36:17] and rejoice for the Lord will do great
[36:20] things be not afraid
[36:23] he beast of the fields for the pastures
[36:25] of the wilderness do spring for the tree
[36:29] Bharath her fruit the victory and the
[36:32] vine to yield her strength be glad then
[36:35] he children of Zion and rejoice in the
[36:38] Lord your God for he has given you the
[36:41] former rain moderately and he will come
[36:43] down cause to come down for you the rain
[36:47] the former rain and the latter rain in
[36:49] the first month and the floors shall be
[36:52] full of wheat in the facts shall
[36:54] overflow with
[36:56] wine and oil and I will restore to you
[36:59] the years that the locust has eaten the
[37:02] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[37:04] Palma worm my great army which has sent
[37:07] among you and ye shall eat him plenty
[37:09] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[37:12] the Lord your God that has dealt one
[37:15] Dursley with you and my people shall
[37:18] never be ashamed and you shall know that
[37:21] I'm in the midst of Israel and that I am
[37:24] the Lord your God and none else and my
[37:27] people shall never be ashamed and he
[37:31] said come to pass afterwards that I will
[37:33] pour out my spirit upon all flesh and
[37:36] your sons and your daughters shall
[37:38] prophesy and your old men shall dream
[37:41] dreams and your young men shall see
[37:43] visions and also upon the servants and
[37:47] upon the handmaids and those days will I
[37:50] pour out my spirit and I will show
[37:53] wonders in the heavens in the earth
[37:56] blood and fire and pillars of smoke and
[38:00] the Sun shall be turned into darkness
[38:02] and the moon into blood before the great
[38:06] and terrible day of the Lord come and it
[38:09] shall come to pass that whosoever shall
[38:12] call on the name of the Lord shall be
[38:14] delivered for in Mount Zion and in
[38:18] Jerusalem shall be delivered as the Lord
[38:21] has said and then the remnant who the
[38:24] Lord shall call and then if you'll give
[38:27] me one more scripture and that will be
[38:30] Luke 24 and in verse one notice we've
[38:33] read read one out of mark and now then
[38:39] spoke of Joel in the Old Testament we
[38:42] want to read and it Luke's account of
[38:44] course there is also Luke's Matthews and
[38:48] and John's account which we won't read
[38:50] this morning but let's just honest read
[38:53] this together Luke chapter 24 verse 1
[38:57] now on the first day of the week very
[39:00] early in the morning they came unto the
[39:04] sepulchre bringing the spices which they
[39:07] had prepared
[39:08] and certain others with them and they
[39:11] found the stone rolled away from the
[39:13] sepulchre and they entered and found not
[39:16] the body of the Lord Jesus but it came
[39:19] to pass they were much perplexed
[39:21] thereabout behold two men stood by them
[39:25] in shining garments and they were afraid
[39:28] and bowed their faces to the earth and
[39:31] they said they said unto them why seek
[39:34] ye the living among the dead
[39:38] well wonderful words that we have read
[39:41] that this morning and as we go back to
[39:45] the thought of where we are in this day
[39:49] and time and and we want to just kind of
[39:51] bring it down to our our RJ and make
[39:55] this pertinent for this morning for a
[39:58] subject today I'm going to be speaking
[40:00] on it's Easter and I want to just
[40:07] capitalize upon where we are in time as
[40:11] we face eternity this quote stands out
[40:15] to me and the sermon I know my Redeemer
[40:18] liveth and this great darkness is
[40:20] swinging over the earth now and there's
[40:23] nothing but to declare that light is
[40:26] pressing its way down when death is
[40:29] hanging so close that it could be in an
[40:32] hour and one hour from now the world
[40:35] could meet its death if death is hanging
[40:38] that close what is what is doing it it's
[40:41] life life is coming the resurrection
[40:45] that Easter for all of God's children it
[40:48] is hanging low it is pressing the angels
[40:52] are coming down the Great Holy Spirit is
[40:55] moving in darkness is taking this last
[40:58] toll nothing for the light most certain
[41:01] be here in Christ will come and the
[41:04] glory and the hope of the ages a real
[41:07] resurrection for all believers and where
[41:10] we will share with him in his
[41:12] resurrection as we have shared with him
[41:14] in his suffering he that suffers with me
[41:17] will reign with me all them
[41:21] I'd be carried home to heaven on a
[41:22] flowery bed of ease while others fought
[41:25] to win the prize and sailed through
[41:27] bloody seas no I must fight if I must
[41:31] rain increasing my courage Lord said
[41:34] that's my prayer and I must not go alone
[41:36] as a coward I must not go around daily
[41:40] with my head hanging down as if
[41:42] something was terrible when I look at
[41:45] the world and all their darkness and
[41:47] their carrying on I must raise my head
[41:50] and walk with my head among the Eagles
[41:53] knowing this that I know him in the
[41:56] power of his resurrection because he
[42:00] lives we live also because he raised
[42:03] from the dead I shall raise also you
[42:06] shall rise also that's what Easter means
[42:09] to the believer and I think of that
[42:12] today what what does Easter mean and I
[42:16] want to think of that as we as we look
[42:19] and hear brother madam tell us in the
[42:21] Easter seal he says how can I deny that
[42:24] the Bible being the truth that Jesus
[42:27] Christ isn't the same yesterday today
[42:29] and forever and see in the hour that
[42:32] we're living in we need an Easter in the
[42:36] church resurrection we need a
[42:38] resurrection to power men and women to
[42:41] stand up out for that which is God's
[42:44] vindicated word so as I reflect back on
[42:49] the Easter's past and certainly we've
[42:52] had some wonderful times at camp and we
[42:54] had wonderful times in the old church
[42:57] when we rejoiced over Eastern and the
[43:01] great resurrection brother Branham in
[43:03] the last year of his life in the last
[43:06] minute and as he finished up his
[43:08] ministry he preached to Easter sermons
[43:11] and first you know he preached the
[43:13] Easter seal and if you two weeks later
[43:16] he preaches it is the rising of the Sun
[43:19] and in his reflections upon the seal and
[43:24] the end thinking of that myself the seal
[43:28] can be thought of in two ways the seal
[43:31] can mean to close
[43:34] or - shut up or the seal can mean
[43:37] Authority or to authenticate on and the
[43:41] show approval or our proof and so um you
[43:46] have one in that day two thousand years
[43:50] ago they were using a seal that were
[43:54] using a seal to seal up Christ in the
[43:57] tomb and the religious system of that
[44:01] day had asked Pilate secure the tomb put
[44:05] a seal upon it close it up make sure the
[44:10] body remains in the tomb and so again
[44:15] that is one meaning of it the other is
[44:18] where God putting the seal when God
[44:21] proves something and so he also
[44:25] authenticates with the seal a seal of
[44:29] his approval
[44:30] so the denominational world uses a seal
[44:33] to close up artist shut up word that God
[44:37] uses a seal when he seals something he
[44:40] seals it with his approval that's what
[44:43] he does when he feels you with the Holy
[44:45] Ghost is the seal of redemption where he
[44:48] puts us approval upon you he
[44:51] authenticates you and of course this is
[44:53] what Easter was doing was authenticating
[44:57] by the resurrection all the words of
[45:00] Jesus to be the truth and brother
[45:03] Branham would tell us in the true Easter
[45:05] seal he said the world is trying and
[45:07] will get worse all the time to seal
[45:11] Christ back in the tomb again they're
[45:14] trying to make him on a historical God
[45:16] on the one that walked and and back in
[45:20] those days give power to the disciples
[45:23] to heal the sick to cast out devils but
[45:25] what they do that as soon as they
[45:27] thought they got rid of them just like
[45:29] Cain did when he thought he got rid of
[45:31] Abel they sealed him in a tomb and they
[45:34] put him in there and today he says
[45:36] they're trying to keep Christ in a tomb
[45:40] but oh what an Easter morning done
[45:43] and Easter morning ruined all of their
[45:46] theology an Easter morning came for a
[45:49] purpose some 1900 years ago to a church
[45:53] and when it did it went through when the
[45:57] Easter morning came it ruined their
[45:59] theology that cannot keep him in a tomb
[46:03] or oppressed by he said you can put him
[46:06] in a Methodist to more Baptist to more a
[46:09] presbyterian to whatever you want to but
[46:13] he raced out of that tomb he is alive
[46:16] today said I had a Baptist tomb and you
[46:19] might had a Methodist tomb but one day
[46:22] Jesus rose from there from my historical
[46:25] God to a living present God alive
[46:29] forevermore
[46:31] man and so now he said for nineteen
[46:34] hundred years or maybe I could save
[46:36] fifteen or fourteen hundred years he
[46:38] said and I think he's referring to the
[46:40] days of Luke's are there he said where
[46:43] you know where the light of the dawn
[46:45] began to begin to dawn upon the earth of
[46:51] the Reformation and he says but but the
[46:54] seven fourteen or fifteen hundred years
[46:56] ago the churches has had him sealed away
[46:58] and he said but it's under pass and the
[47:02] last days saith god and there's nothing
[47:04] gonna stop it and I want to remind you
[47:08] today even now nothing is gonna stop the
[47:11] Word of God nothing is gonna stop the
[47:14] prophecies that have been spoke for this
[47:16] age to be fulfilled
[47:18] nothing time means nothing to God I just
[47:22] mean nothing to God a man no men's ideas
[47:26] mean nothing to God
[47:28] but I tell you his word will be
[47:31] fulfilled in the hour that it's meant
[47:33] for fulfillment and man the word has
[47:36] went forth there Sammy light in the
[47:39] evening time and he says I don't care
[47:41] how many seals that you trying to put
[47:44] over God will break every seal he broke
[47:47] the seal that it term he broke the seal
[47:50] of hell he broke the seal of death he
[47:53] broke the seal of the great
[47:54] and the elusive there forever more
[47:57] triumphant over death hell and the grave
[48:00] and tombs and every man-made thing to
[48:03] show he was glad and he cannot be sealed
[48:06] away from the people anymore let me tell
[48:11] you every devil there is cannot put him
[48:14] back in the tomb once he raised up
[48:16] nothing can hold him the grave couldn't
[48:19] be dug deep enough and man the stoner
[48:22] couldn't be couldn't be big enough no
[48:26] matter how many tons of me away it was
[48:28] way too big for those women as many of
[48:31] the words to move it around it it was it
[48:34] took a massive amount of effort once
[48:36] that it was sealed but let me tell you
[48:39] it could not be it could not be sealed
[48:42] good enough to hold Christ in the grave
[48:46] nothing could hold him he broke it every
[48:49] seal with that great Easter seal that
[48:52] she was sealed with a man the same seal
[48:56] he said that I wear you're gonna wear it
[48:59] also a man were he that believeth in me
[49:02] the works that I do shall he do also and
[49:05] greater than T shall you do for I go to
[49:09] my father how are you going to keep it
[49:11] down how you going to keep it sealed up
[49:13] and I'm just gonna say today you're not
[49:16] going to keep the message sealed up hey
[49:19] man this already broke free in there in
[49:22] the Garden of Eden when man said he was
[49:25] sealed out of the garden it was the tree
[49:28] of life was guarded there was no
[49:32] offering appropriated the blood of bulls
[49:35] and goats could not take away sin this
[49:38] would be reflected even in the the large
[49:42] veil in the tabernacle when when it was
[49:46] hung there to seal the worshipper from
[49:49] the presence of the Shekinah glory but
[49:53] when the day of pinnacles come brother
[49:55] with Jesus time David Calvary and finish
[49:58] the work he didn't seal
[49:59] man out a man he sealed man inside with
[50:03] himself a man and now we're sealed up
[50:07] and shut up in the presence of the
[50:10] Shekinah glory hey man we got a seal the
[50:13] Bible said grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[50:15] God whereby you are sealed unto the day
[50:18] of redemption and then it shows that sin
[50:21] has been paid for and God has accepted
[50:24] you and you've been sealed into Christ
[50:27] but the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[50:29] sin is finished and they eat and eat
[50:32] Earls seal has been placed upon you and
[50:35] there's no devil in hell can break that
[50:37] seal a man now we are resurrected today
[50:43] that gives ourselves a resurrection no
[50:46] wonder we can have such joy that we have
[50:49] in victory over the things of God
[50:52] because we have been resurrected and
[50:54] when those he did foreknow he also
[50:57] called and those he called he justified
[51:00] and those he justified he hath glorified
[51:04] he that saw us and eternal past has
[51:08] already seen us in the eternal future
[51:10] and man what because here is only in
[51:13] time where it's past and his future but
[51:16] all that great eternal day he saw us
[51:19] there rejoicing and shouting in the
[51:22] great victory in Christ and here we are
[51:24] in time doing what we did in eternity
[51:28] and we are resurrected with him the
[51:31] Bible said and what does that word mean
[51:34] that we're raised with him were raised
[51:37] with him in the spiritual resurrection
[51:40] you know we're quicken it means that
[51:42] we're made alive that we ourselves have
[51:46] experienced that great resurrection and
[51:49] we who were once dead in sins and
[51:52] trespasses now we are alive and we can
[51:56] never die man we can never be sealed
[51:59] again away from his presence we
[52:01] the devil can no more ever get into us
[52:05] again we're sealed unto the day of
[52:07] redemption so what a difference God
[52:12] sealed is from the from the from the
[52:16] religious world seal God's Word and his
[52:21] seal seals you in with Christ
[52:25] authenticating you securing you putting
[52:29] a seal of approval upon you while the
[52:33] seal of the religious world wants to
[52:35] keep Christ and his anointing in his
[52:37] power and his life away from you keeping
[52:41] you and him just sealed and dead in the
[52:46] tomb but the Easter message is don't
[52:50] tell my disciples I have a risen from
[52:55] the dead hallelujah and you know brother
[52:59] Branham when he would describe this he
[53:01] would use a word essence he said the
[53:03] very essence of this resurrection I want
[53:06] to talk about that word just omit the
[53:08] word yes it means that nature of
[53:11] something that determines its character
[53:14] or the property of something without
[53:16] which it would not exist or be what it
[53:19] is so there there is an essence a
[53:24] property to this resurrection meaning
[53:28] meaning again is something without which
[53:30] it it would not exist or be what it is
[53:33] it makes it what it is
[53:35] that something that makes the
[53:39] resurrection what it is he said the
[53:41] essence of this resurrection is to tell
[53:44] and to show and to prove that Jesus has
[53:49] risen from the dead
[53:51] hey man that's what we need I need just
[53:53] a little more sound up here alright now
[53:55] he's not dead but he's living and he
[53:58] lives here he is in us I'll be with you
[54:01] even in you to the end of the world a
[54:04] little wild the world will see me no
[54:05] more yet you will see me for I'll be
[54:08] with you even in you to the end of the
[54:10] world you see now then
[54:12] same essence of the message that's the
[54:16] same essence of the message because it
[54:19] is a resurrection message want to get
[54:22] this this message is a resurrection
[54:25] message where it tells the sufferer the
[54:29] weary the downtrodden a man that you
[54:33] don't have to remain in a downtrodden
[54:36] weary suffering condition but you can
[54:41] rise and be healed delivered a man and
[54:46] ensures that we are the resurrection and
[54:49] the life and this is not a dead message
[54:52] but one of life and it's a message of
[54:55] the resurrection now without this
[54:59] property without this essence the
[55:03] message is worthless here with me tell
[55:09] me what what really would be the meaning
[55:12] of the message if Jesus had went to the
[55:16] tomb and not risen you see the
[55:22] resurrection was the essence of the
[55:26] message it made the message what it was
[55:31] without the resurrection the message
[55:35] would have been invalid man but I want
[55:39] you to know I know I want you to know
[55:42] even this message today without the
[55:44] resurrection life in it
[55:46] the message is worthless it is invalid
[55:51] it is meaningless but this message
[55:55] declares the healer the deliverer has
[55:58] conquered death and that we are the
[56:01] beneficiaries of his resurrection amen
[56:06] now in it is the rising of the Sun
[56:10] brother Branham uses this word again and
[56:12] he says now the very essence the
[56:16] properties of the message that was
[56:18] seared was that he is risen from the
[56:22] dead
[56:22] we are his benefit
[56:25] Aries we share the message that
[56:28] Resurrection with him and draw benefits
[56:30] from this by proving to the world that
[56:33] he is alive and and he says that we
[56:36] cannot do it by word only and we cannot
[56:40] do it by tradition of man we only
[56:44] reflect exactly what we're pointing to a
[56:47] man notice again the essence of the
[56:54] message he is risen from the dead and
[57:00] man this is what makes the message of
[57:02] value that he's not dead
[57:06] but that is a living he's alive that
[57:09] he's not in the tomb a man whether it's
[57:12] terms of manmade theology and my whether
[57:15] students of religion where is that old
[57:18] tune their tomb that was carved out as a
[57:20] cave and was and he was placed within it
[57:23] matters not and when the essence of the
[57:26] message is he's not dead he's alive and
[57:31] the essence of the entire message is he
[57:34] is he's alive and he's the same
[57:37] yesterday today and forever
[57:39] well what he did he is now what he was
[57:43] he still is he's he I am ever present
[57:46] present tense God now he cannot do it we
[57:53] cannot do it by word only I hear your
[57:58] ministers to say and today well what we
[58:00] need to do is you know it's not that not
[58:03] nothing over the Holy Ghost we need we
[58:06] need a teaching we already got two
[58:09] teaching without two thousand years of
[58:13] teaching without the intense teaching in
[58:16] the last I want to save 56 and fifty
[58:20] five years or so weary that intense
[58:22] teaching hey man maybe I could say 75
[58:27] years we've got we've had intense
[58:29] teaching but what we need is not just
[58:32] word today we need the light for that
[58:35] word
[58:36] I mean we need to be able to declare
[58:39] he's not just to pluck he's not just to
[58:42] take a man it's not just about a
[58:45] religious system it's not about new
[58:48] buildings it's not about big gatherings
[58:51] it's about him and he's like we can't do
[58:59] it by word only in the Easter seal
[59:02] brother Brennan said Easter I have
[59:05] stepped it in my own heart as the
[59:08] greatest event of the year the greatest
[59:13] event of the year
[59:15] let me tell you friends because we're
[59:18] living in the easter of all Easter's
[59:20] we're living in the greatest event ever
[59:26] perhaps it's as I said the greatest
[59:29] event of all time and I wonder you're
[59:33] saying not only the event that happened
[59:35] 2,000 years ago not the celebration
[59:38] today where thousand J millions of
[59:42] preachers are talking about a past event
[59:47] but this lunar we're not talking about a
[59:50] past event
[59:52] man we are talking about a present event
[59:56] we are in another Easter it is another
[1:00:01] resurrection our a man it's Easter
[1:00:06] if I get kidding across the church I'm
[1:00:09] not talking about your calendar I'm not
[1:00:11] talking about the day set aside I'm
[1:00:13] talking about this day this hour this
[1:00:16] time we're living in it's Easter it's
[1:00:21] resurrection out it's rupturing time
[1:00:24] it's the last days it's the greatest
[1:00:28] event of all time
[1:00:31] happening right now and you're a part of
[1:00:34] it man you may be at this moment sad
[1:00:40] disillusioned you know confuse you know
[1:00:43] well he said he was a prophet and and he
[1:00:46] would do this and and time has went on
[1:00:48] and we thought this would be whoa what
[1:00:51] would deliver us in and where is this
[1:00:54] promise rapture and maybe you're all
[1:00:56] confused and wondering and pondering and
[1:00:59] sad and disheartened but I want to
[1:01:02] announce to you this morning again it's
[1:01:05] Easter oh man he's risen some are going
[1:01:12] the other way and disillusioned and on
[1:01:15] the way to Emmaus but I'll tell you ever
[1:01:18] see that God is going to find and you'll
[1:01:21] find you this morning no matter where
[1:01:25] you are perhaps for a moment let's take
[1:01:31] and go back in our thinking for a little
[1:01:33] bit you know before Jesus coming there
[1:01:38] have been great men there had been great
[1:01:41] mighty prophets like Moses Elijah there
[1:01:45] had been teaching priests like Ezra
[1:01:47] there had been Kings like David and
[1:01:50] Solomon and great leaders but finally
[1:01:55] that they arrived from mankind to be
[1:01:58] delivered from the tyranny of sin and
[1:02:02] the same is true I want to I want to
[1:02:06] just compare the two Easter's because as
[1:02:09] I've been saying we are in and Easter
[1:02:11] there was an Easter we are banana Easter
[1:02:14] we are now in Easter so let's let's
[1:02:18] compare that with today the same is true
[1:02:20] of today there have been great moves of
[1:02:23] God in the past there's been a loser and
[1:02:27] Wesley and finis and moody wiglesworth
[1:02:31] and buz Worthen and lower I'm on
[1:02:35] everybody maybe have their favorites of
[1:02:37] great men of God down to the ages that
[1:02:41] you could call their names but that must
[1:02:45] come at Easter where the chance moves
[1:02:49] and the power of the Resurrection like
[1:02:53] brother madam said of today he compared
[1:02:55] the bride with the church that's two
[1:02:57] cars and he said those that were shiny
[1:03:00] right off the assembly line filled with
[1:03:03] gas or the highest octane but one with
[1:03:06] her with it with only mechanics a great
[1:03:09] machine with no dynamics and the other
[1:03:12] with both dynamics and mechanics it's
[1:03:15] kind of like a bird takes two wings to
[1:03:17] fly hey man you got out the word and the
[1:03:20] spirit you gotta have the mechanics and
[1:03:23] the dynamics and by the way brother
[1:03:26] branham's said as far as the movement as
[1:03:30] far as where he was as far as the ages
[1:03:33] past we had put too much stress on the
[1:03:37] mechanics and I put nothing on the
[1:03:39] dynamics
[1:03:43] no wonder the church doesn't get off the
[1:03:47] ground spins around and around and
[1:03:50] around with this little one wing dance
[1:03:53] word one word we got the word with the
[1:03:56] word with the word bright with the word
[1:03:58] people and my wherewithal that's true
[1:04:02] but what good of it if the other wing
[1:04:05] isn't there spinning around and around
[1:04:09] the circle of malachite for Malecha for
[1:04:12] God sent a prophet
[1:04:13] revelation Tim seven the seven seals
[1:04:15] rope and we're in the seven set why is
[1:04:17] all your noise about unless the dynamics
[1:04:22] or their with the mechanics to make the
[1:04:27] church rise in faith rise in glory
[1:04:31] rise in power rise and resurrection
[1:04:35] faith him out and his brother Brandon
[1:04:39] would look back he says there have been
[1:04:43] churches churches
[1:04:44] Brides Brides churches brides bride but
[1:04:48] there's gotta come on hey man hallelujah
[1:04:52] there's gonna come a real bride now
[1:04:55] listen church he wasn't saying they've
[1:04:57] kind of come another message they've got
[1:05:00] to come another prophet he was saying
[1:05:02] there's gonna come a bride
[1:05:04] a man there's got to come one that's not
[1:05:08] only got the mechanics but the dynamics
[1:05:11] of it and makes that Churchill live and
[1:05:14] moving the power of the resurrection
[1:05:17] missile until we come to that place
[1:05:19] until we find that place what good does
[1:05:22] it do to polish the hubs and now what
[1:05:25] good does it do to give her a facelift
[1:05:28] or putt or is this a simonized job which
[1:05:30] is a polishing job when when there's no
[1:05:33] dynamics to it no matter how much the
[1:05:37] mechanics proved to be right there's got
[1:05:40] to be a dynamics to make it work
[1:05:43] a man now before Jesus came there had
[1:05:51] been great man there had been a Moses a
[1:05:54] lawgiver on Elisha the restorer there
[1:05:58] were the songs of David the wisdom of
[1:06:00] Solomon the prophecies of the prophets
[1:06:03] but now came the word that they were all
[1:06:08] affected reflecting and it was all
[1:06:11] bottled up now in the man Christ Jesus
[1:06:16] if I could say it this way in
[1:06:19] paraphrasing this and the Easter seal he
[1:06:22] said before there had been prophets on
[1:06:24] the earth who had prophesied before him
[1:06:27] and they had healed the sick raised the
[1:06:31] dead
[1:06:31] done great signs that Jesus did remember
[1:06:36] Easter proved it it's sealed or
[1:06:39] authenticated the word forever for the
[1:06:43] true believer all gloom and doubt were
[1:06:46] shattered at that blissful morning a man
[1:06:50] who had been shut up as it was in a
[1:06:52] prison house even religious people
[1:06:55] before this day because it's in great
[1:06:58] religious moves and Moving's of the holy
[1:07:01] spirit and so forth but when a man died
[1:07:04] it just seemed to settle it
[1:07:06] you know man your Moses died and he just
[1:07:10] seemed you know well his law and all of
[1:07:13] that feeds us a great event in history
[1:07:16] wouldn't
[1:07:17] spirit of God had come down upon the
[1:07:19] mountain and through and carved it out
[1:07:21] in stone
[1:07:22] Joshua died and then the Israel went
[1:07:26] into doing whatever man thought was
[1:07:29] right in his own eyes
[1:07:31] but when Jesus came he said I have the
[1:07:36] power to lay my life down and I have the
[1:07:40] power to take it up again
[1:07:43] Moses couldn't say this man Joseph
[1:07:47] couldn't say this Jeremiah
[1:07:50] couldn't say this but Jesus said it and
[1:07:54] then he proved what he said and brother
[1:07:57] Brendan to me that was the seal of it
[1:08:00] when something is said and then it's
[1:08:02] turned around and prove them a man if
[1:08:07] that had not happened what Jesus would
[1:08:09] have just been a booster someone who
[1:08:11] made great claims but had nothing to
[1:08:13] back it up but I want you to know it
[1:08:16] wasn't just great claims that Jay on
[1:08:19] that Easter morning a man he had laid
[1:08:23] his life down and now was raising it up
[1:08:26] again and the days of Jesus you know
[1:08:29] were very supernatural times that
[1:08:33] parallel our time they were the closing
[1:08:36] of the Old Testament and an old coming
[1:08:38] and we're the closing of a new covenant
[1:08:40] how many believes that we're in the
[1:08:43] closing of the New Covenant though we're
[1:08:45] the last age and the final voice to the
[1:08:48] final age the days of Jesus was a very
[1:08:51] supernatural time where heaven was
[1:08:53] pouring out his message I want you to
[1:08:56] understand this is why even even um
[1:08:59] Peter could pull that prophecy right
[1:09:02] there
[1:09:02] that God was pouring out his spirit now
[1:09:09] heaven was pouring out his message an
[1:09:13] angel appears to Zechariah now even been
[1:09:17] thousands I almost hundreds at least of
[1:09:20] years since there had been a real
[1:09:24] visitation of the supernatural if you
[1:09:27] know between Malachi the last
[1:09:30] look in our Bible in the opening of New
[1:09:32] Testament it seems a very short distance
[1:09:34] because all that you do is just flip a
[1:09:37] page from Malachi to Matthew but in
[1:09:41] there lays hundreds of years and there
[1:09:46] you know all of a sudden actor along the
[1:09:51] winter time after long series of
[1:09:55] droughts of not hearing the voice of God
[1:09:58] that seeing an angel of God it seemed
[1:10:01] like God had forgot his promise but I
[1:10:04] want you to know God never forgets a
[1:10:06] promise and when he starts something
[1:10:09] into action it will continue there might
[1:10:12] be seasons like between Jesus twelve
[1:10:16] twelve years old and coming out at
[1:10:18] thirty years old there was seasons do we
[1:10:21] we don't see anything happening we don't
[1:10:24] see anything moving but it was moving
[1:10:26] anyway things was maturing moving in the
[1:10:30] place getting ready for the appearing of
[1:10:33] the forerunner and then would come the
[1:10:36] day the Messiah right behind him now
[1:10:40] here there at that moment in time
[1:10:45] suddenly appears to Sakurai a priest of
[1:10:50] the lineage of Levi and he's there and
[1:10:54] it's his course to go in and offer um
[1:10:58] the the sacrifice and and then they and
[1:11:02] the incense to be poured out and it's
[1:11:04] his job to to pour this out and and to
[1:11:09] to let the the prayers of the people who
[1:11:13] are under expectation from Messiah and
[1:11:16] they're crying Lord send your Messiah
[1:11:19] Lord send your Messiah Lord said that
[1:11:23] during Israel is expecting a child my
[1:11:26] Elizabeth you know she is also been
[1:11:29] longing for a child and she has been
[1:11:32] crying to God Jane after day months
[1:11:36] after months and now she's past days and
[1:11:39] maybe her prayers are less
[1:11:42] and maybe she's given up maybe it's
[1:11:45] hopeless now and maybe is her timer or
[1:11:48] with women is now ceased and has been
[1:11:51] for years and all of a sudden here an
[1:11:54] angel appears appears to to Zechariah
[1:11:58] and there you know the angel begins to
[1:12:03] give a message and since God is
[1:12:06] anointing and sending out of forerunner
[1:12:09] and he's going to prepare the way for
[1:12:11] the Messiah and the angel disappears and
[1:12:15] then and then they're visitations are
[1:12:17] due to Mary of Gabriel who comes to her
[1:12:21] and says you know you're a highly
[1:12:24] favored you're gonna bring forth the
[1:12:26] trial and his name shall be called Jesus
[1:12:29] and and the message comes and then the
[1:12:32] visitation comes and anointings hit
[1:12:35] Elizabeth and hits Mary and she gives a
[1:12:39] salutation and to Elizabeth and the
[1:12:42] prophecies come forth and Anna and
[1:12:44] Simeon as we all prophesy of what God is
[1:12:49] doing
[1:12:50] angels break through the dimensions to
[1:12:54] Shepherds and John comes on the scene as
[1:12:57] a forerunner announcing there's one of
[1:13:00] the mungyu and he's here he's here you
[1:13:04] know standing among you somewhere and
[1:13:07] there then a life like a dove then a
[1:13:10] voice comes out of heaven and then it
[1:13:14] annoys a man of carpenter a little
[1:13:19] carpenter's son and there he is baptized
[1:13:22] in the water and the dub feels him and
[1:13:25] he's led of the Spirit and anointed now
[1:13:28] and then he moves out into his ministry
[1:13:31] and at that time they work on say a
[1:13:34] decreasing of the messenger as he moves
[1:13:37] off the scene and his message is now in
[1:13:40] flash as Jesus begins to demonstrate God
[1:13:44] to the world are you with me and brother
[1:13:48] man would say and what is attraction on
[1:13:51] the mountain is about that
[1:13:53] I'm the Prophet turned and said behold
[1:13:56] there comes the Lamb of God that takes
[1:13:58] away the sin of the world
[1:14:00] now what is the attraction and he said
[1:14:04] it's changed from the Prophet to his
[1:14:07] prophecy you see it was just continuing
[1:14:11] and unfolding of the same angelic visit
[1:14:17] are you with me romantic that moves
[1:14:20] there from the you know dare upon
[1:14:23] Zachariah moving upon Elizabeth moving
[1:14:26] upon Mary moving upon Simeon move it
[1:14:29] upon Anna moving on John moving down and
[1:14:33] comes now and the prophecy here it comes
[1:14:36] in Jesus Christ
[1:14:40] now these junctions are so hard for
[1:14:45] people you find people even over years
[1:14:49] later in acts 19 who had missed the
[1:14:52] junction there were disciples of John
[1:14:55] but they didn't know Jesus and his
[1:14:57] resurrection there were baptized and
[1:15:00] John but didn't know the one he pointed
[1:15:03] to you know I it's hard for me sometimes
[1:15:07] to to grasp how that men could stand
[1:15:11] there and see Jesus pointed out as the
[1:15:14] one who knew John said I bear witness I
[1:15:18] saw the Doug come on him and how how
[1:15:22] then you know would there still be
[1:15:25] disciples of John and baptize him with
[1:15:28] John and still carrying on and even a
[1:15:30] group of John's disciples some many
[1:15:33] years later who didn't know Jesus who
[1:15:39] didn't know his resurrection
[1:15:41] who didn't know the power of the Holy
[1:15:43] Ghost who didn't even know the correct
[1:15:46] water baptism didn't even recognize the
[1:15:50] one he was pointing to they had idolized
[1:15:55] the man Danah idolized his boldness they
[1:16:00] thought they were ready for the Messiah
[1:16:02] but they didn't know the Messiah had
[1:16:04] come was already crucem
[1:16:07] five rescinded and sit back his holy
[1:16:09] spirit of changed forms again by the
[1:16:12] time dozer Knights 19 caught up he'd
[1:16:15] already changed forms again he was no
[1:16:18] longer in the man of Galilee now he was
[1:16:20] in a multi-member body the Saint Jesus
[1:16:23] and the effects of the angel had just
[1:16:26] moved forward now into a church we hear
[1:16:36] him today still talking about the
[1:16:38] forerunner who brought the message
[1:16:41] there's still enamored infatuated to the
[1:16:45] point of enchantment
[1:16:46] about the forerunner and they've never
[1:16:49] ever seen the one he was pointing to
[1:16:53] this is true about Jesus even today men
[1:16:58] are enchanted with the man of gallery
[1:17:02] they are talking about the resurrection
[1:17:06] Easter sermons men priests everywhere
[1:17:10] he's not dead he's risen he's risen and
[1:17:13] they're talking about the resurrection
[1:17:15] but I wouldn't say fruit if Jesus had
[1:17:18] only risen and that had completed
[1:17:21] everything we would still be in our sins
[1:17:27] hallelujah that resurrection power had
[1:17:32] to come in the hearts of the church a
[1:17:35] man they had to be participants in the
[1:17:38] resurrection themselves not you seeing
[1:17:41] him come out of the tomb not just
[1:17:44] witnessing the angel but they themselves
[1:17:46] receive the eternal life on the inside
[1:17:49] that happened on that day of Pentecost
[1:17:52] when the Holy Ghost came like a like a
[1:17:55] mighty rushing wind and a pillar of
[1:17:58] whipping fire and the angel of the Lord
[1:18:01] the angel of his presence came down and
[1:18:04] ascended into Everhart you see they had
[1:18:11] to participate in the resurrection they
[1:18:13] had to become the resurrection
[1:18:17] also not just know that he rose from the
[1:18:21] dead
[1:18:22] that's knowledge not just to know that
[1:18:25] but to know they had risen with him and
[1:18:29] that's what Jesus pointed to remember
[1:18:32] Jesus
[1:18:34] he pointed him something he did not he
[1:18:37] did not point back to his cross or
[1:18:40] treason - he pointed ahead to the city
[1:18:44] of Jerusalem - and he said go and wait
[1:18:47] in the city of Jerusalem until you are
[1:18:49] endued with power from on high until you
[1:18:53] yourself get this resurrection power on
[1:18:56] the inside of you until you become the
[1:18:59] Easter sea he was crucified by the
[1:19:08] church world crucified and put in a tomb
[1:19:11] on the third day he rose bringing with
[1:19:16] him the Old Testament Saints ascended
[1:19:18] into heaven with him then 50 days later
[1:19:21] his Holy Spirit comes on the day of
[1:19:25] Pentecost notice there in the upper room
[1:19:29] the resurrection happened again that's
[1:19:32] the quickening power struck 120 and they
[1:19:36] were filled with the Spirit of Jesus the
[1:19:39] Holy Ghost now God was in his church
[1:19:42] like I said before before he was there
[1:19:46] in in the in Jesus Christ we could even
[1:19:50] go beyond that we can see the angel of
[1:19:52] God moving in John the Baptist now we
[1:19:55] see it's here and it's smooth and it's
[1:19:58] not moving into Jesus Christ now it
[1:20:01] moves from Jesus right into the church
[1:20:06] now the same Jesus not another Jesus but
[1:20:12] the same Jesus is working through
[1:20:15] multiple body call the church and they
[1:20:20] were resurrected from death to life it
[1:20:23] was a spiritual resurrection
[1:20:26] the visions 2 and 5 Paul begins to teach
[1:20:29] this and expound and explain
[1:20:31] said even when we were dead and since we
[1:20:34] were dead just as dead as Jesus was in
[1:20:37] the tomb we were dead in sins and hath
[1:20:40] quickened us together with Christ by
[1:20:43] grace are you saved
[1:20:46] well that's what quicken means made
[1:20:48] alive with together with Christ and it
[1:20:51] raised us up together and made us sit in
[1:20:55] heavenly places in Christ Jesus that was
[1:21:00] the church now unfortunately just as it
[1:21:07] happened with Israel receiving their
[1:21:09] Pentecost were the law came to them
[1:21:11] fifty days after and they would finally
[1:21:15] disintegrate into and a whoring group of
[1:21:19] people and become away and scattered
[1:21:23] even so the second Eve like the first
[1:21:28] Eve Satan got into the book of Acts
[1:21:32] Church in the time of waiting in the
[1:21:37] time of teryan now it changed this form
[1:21:40] like a seed planted and it changed this
[1:21:43] farming out of the seed comes life but
[1:21:48] it's now in a different form is not in
[1:21:50] seed form it's now in a little leaf it
[1:21:54] starts to push his way up through the
[1:21:56] soil roots began to go down and so the
[1:22:02] same thing would happen with the church
[1:22:05] but Satan would get a knee in the book
[1:22:08] of Acts Church come and saying we don't
[1:22:12] need this here shouting we don't need
[1:22:15] speakers and tongues what we need to do
[1:22:18] is sweetie word and we need to take that
[1:22:21] word and tweak it and tweak the gospel
[1:22:25] and they tweaked it until God was no
[1:22:28] longer one but three and they tweaked it
[1:22:33] until Jesus was no longer the
[1:22:35] intercessor but Mary and they tweaked it
[1:22:38] until the days of miracles were not
[1:22:42] present but
[1:22:43] and soon the experience of the real
[1:22:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost was lost from
[1:22:49] the church and the power was gone and
[1:22:52] the church plotted along and dead forms
[1:22:55] as they put Christ back in the tomb I
[1:23:02] like to did with the body of Christ a
[1:23:05] you don't chuck the body that had been
[1:23:08] mangled by Roman creeps and spiced it
[1:23:14] made it to smell good and dressed it and
[1:23:19] prepared it for death but then came the
[1:23:25] age of reformation with Luther and
[1:23:29] Wesley and then Azusa Street and the
[1:23:34] seasons were changing I want you to know
[1:23:37] Easter is always at a time when seasons
[1:23:41] are changing right now you hear the news
[1:23:45] that in Louisiana we're having storms
[1:23:48] that are coming across this area because
[1:23:51] it's like his winter is trying to make
[1:23:54] its last hoorah and push spring back we
[1:24:00] have the flowers and one where crops are
[1:24:03] being planted we have trees that are
[1:24:05] butting out and the pecans which is the
[1:24:07] last of the trees we had already now
[1:24:11] beginning to bud but then a war in the
[1:24:14] heavens us is trying to make its final
[1:24:17] stand and in those moments or tornadoes
[1:24:21] and storms and winds hail and rain and
[1:24:25] fierceness but no matter what attracts
[1:24:29] it can never put spring back it's coming
[1:24:34] out anyhow hallelujah because the Sun
[1:24:39] have setting into motion
[1:24:42] man and the rays of light and the days
[1:24:45] have got long
[1:24:46] and no matter what the clouds tried to
[1:24:48] do and the wind's tried to do it will
[1:24:51] never bring it back man it can never
[1:24:54] stop spraying from coming and I just
[1:24:57] want to tell your church no matter what
[1:24:59] kind of storms are out there no matter
[1:25:02] what kind of demons that we are facing
[1:25:04] no matter what kind of age and a
[1:25:07] ruthless and godless age that where is
[1:25:09] he can they can never ever put Christ
[1:25:13] and his bride back in the tomb they
[1:25:17] maintain never stopped these men because
[1:25:21] here we're at the changing of the season
[1:25:24] and it is the rising of the Sun and the
[1:25:27] light is signing a memo are we on Earth
[1:25:30] Day today
[1:25:31] a rise and shine for thy light has come
[1:25:35] and his glory it's been seen upon yet
[1:25:39] [Music]
[1:25:41] there is no way that they can ever stop
[1:25:47] it comes the age and Reformation with
[1:25:52] Luther Wesley Azusa Street season is
[1:25:56] changing suddenly a forerunner comes
[1:26:00] like John the Baptist
[1:26:02] this is not only testified on the Ohio
[1:26:05] River with brother Branham is preaching
[1:26:09] and and baptized in his 17th person and
[1:26:13] there the voice comes out of heaven
[1:26:15] saying this john the baptist was sent to
[1:26:18] forerun the first coming of christ
[1:26:20] you're sent with a message to forerun
[1:26:22] his second was not only there but the
[1:26:26] Pentecostals they would prophesy the
[1:26:29] same thing over and again standing and
[1:26:33] the means never heard the prophecy
[1:26:35] before and we begin to prophesy the
[1:26:38] spirit fallen upon men and women and
[1:26:41] they prophesy and under the anointing as
[1:26:44] termed the balance and of course it
[1:26:50] would be after that happened in 1933
[1:26:55] that an angel appears
[1:26:58] in 1946 and restoration begins now would
[1:27:06] you understand there have been times of
[1:27:08] reformation but this is not a
[1:27:11] Reformation this is a restoration a man
[1:27:16] the season was changing as a forerunner
[1:27:19] comes and an angel visit and restoration
[1:27:24] begins and sue not only is it John the
[1:27:28] Baptist were the Ministry of Elijah but
[1:27:31] also we begin to see the very Ministry
[1:27:34] of Christ is repeated again what was it
[1:27:41] not only was the tomb sealed revelation
[1:27:47] five shows a book that was sealed
[1:27:50] without its opening all is lost
[1:27:54] unless it's given back to man it's all
[1:27:57] for nothing Calvary is for nothing the
[1:28:00] resurrection is for nothing
[1:28:02] a man just as if Jesus just resurrected
[1:28:06] and appeared as disciples raised the
[1:28:07] dead of the ages but didn't send a
[1:28:09] resurrection and it changed for those
[1:28:11] waiting a Pentecost
[1:28:12] it'll been all for nothing would have
[1:28:17] meant nothing to us in the 120 or even
[1:28:23] us today notice the seventh seal was
[1:28:30] breaking it was open breaking the
[1:28:32] silence of his coming there was the
[1:28:35] revelation of it certainly that we
[1:28:38] received in this day but there was an
[1:28:41] actual time where that we are in that
[1:28:44] time of that seventh seal where that
[1:28:47] where the coming of the Lord is in
[1:28:50] manifestation and this coming wood began
[1:28:53] it would actually begin we can really
[1:28:56] really see it take form as a forerunner
[1:28:59] comes on the scene with signs and
[1:29:03] wonders and miracles things that are
[1:29:05] happening
[1:29:07] revelation 8:1 says when he opened the
[1:29:10] Seventh Seal that
[1:29:11] silence in heaven about the space of a
[1:29:14] half an hour and I saw that seven angels
[1:29:18] which stood before God and to them that
[1:29:21] were given seven trumpets notice there
[1:29:24] was a time that is represented by
[1:29:26] half-hour silence it's symbolic that
[1:29:30] there would be a time that something was
[1:29:32] silence that was kept back from the
[1:29:35] church that the church would go through
[1:29:38] these days can I say ages of science hey
[1:29:44] man where the mysteries of God would
[1:29:46] wait until the end time but finally
[1:29:49] another angel come man stood at the
[1:29:52] altar having a golden censer it was they
[1:29:55] given him much incense that he should
[1:29:57] offer it with the prayers of all the
[1:29:59] saints upon the golden altar which was
[1:30:02] before the throne and the smoke of the
[1:30:04] incense which came up with the prayers
[1:30:06] of saints ascended up before God and the
[1:30:09] Angels hand and the angel took the
[1:30:11] censer and filled it with the fire the
[1:30:13] altar and cast into the earth notice
[1:30:16] what's happened in the heavenly realms
[1:30:18] now comes down to the earth and there
[1:30:20] were voices and thunders and lightnings
[1:30:23] and an earthquake and seven angels which
[1:30:27] had the seven trumpets prepared
[1:30:28] themselves to sound now we can look
[1:30:33] right here in our day and know that
[1:30:36] incense has been mixed with the prayers
[1:30:39] on the altar and they have been received
[1:30:42] before God just like then the days of
[1:30:45] Zechariah there were many offerings of
[1:30:47] incense many days many years year after
[1:30:51] year after year but this day was
[1:30:54] different this day an angel stood down
[1:30:58] and he said God's heard your prayers
[1:31:01] the incense has reached God the prayers
[1:31:05] have come into his presence and now is
[1:31:08] the time to fulfill this promise I'm
[1:31:10] sending the forerunner hallelujah oh man
[1:31:14] the thing there that had wondered about
[1:31:18] all their lives now the silence is
[1:31:20] broken now it's no more
[1:31:22] silence things begin to happen things
[1:31:25] begin to materialize and take place and
[1:31:28] now comes the appearance of their angel
[1:31:31] and starts to John starts a chain of
[1:31:34] events like an explosion that never
[1:31:37] stops starts there were the angel coming
[1:31:41] to Zacharias moves on to Elizabeth they
[1:31:45] are to Mary and then Elizabeth and
[1:31:46] Elizabeth and on and on and on as they
[1:31:49] keep some move and expand and expanded
[1:31:52] until it brings them asylum to see until
[1:31:55] it Breezer the death the barrel the
[1:31:57] resurrection and brings the Holy Ghost
[1:31:59] right there on the day of Pentecost and
[1:32:02] this is what God is doing in this last
[1:32:05] day as the prayers of the saints that
[1:32:08] have prayed for this day and prayed for
[1:32:11] this hour let me tell you church we're
[1:32:13] no longer in the days of silence we're
[1:32:16] in the days of the boss remember God has
[1:32:19] sounded out his word and there have been
[1:32:21] thunders and lightnings and earthquakes
[1:32:24] and upheavals in the world and even
[1:32:27] we're experiencing right now but I just
[1:32:29] want you to know it's God breaking the
[1:32:32] silence as it moves from one phase to
[1:32:37] another
[1:32:38] now the same in our day the churches
[1:32:42] look for for the return of Jesus Christ
[1:32:45] he's been expected Elizabeth was
[1:32:48] expecting Israel was expecting a man and
[1:32:52] now his word was about to be fulfilled D
[1:32:57] and it comes with it begins initiates
[1:32:59] with the coming of an angel and and then
[1:33:04] and then of course today's same in our
[1:33:07] day that the thing the church has been
[1:33:10] looking for we have been under
[1:33:12] expectancy like Israel for 2,000 years
[1:33:17] seven Gentile Church ages hey man we've
[1:33:21] been looking for the return of Jesus
[1:33:24] Christ
[1:33:25] a man ever is coming for a mature church
[1:33:29] without spot or wrinkle
[1:33:33] hallelujah and before we can meet him in
[1:33:36] the air receive that promise sir the
[1:33:38] church has gotta be ready there's got to
[1:33:43] be a virgin spoke to that's gotta be
[1:33:47] I've been an easel appear to her and
[1:33:50] give her the greetings and say you're
[1:33:52] chosen to bring forth Christ back to
[1:33:55] this age and I want you to know through
[1:33:58] that's what this angel was sent to do it
[1:34:01] was to tell you you have been selected
[1:34:04] you have been chosen you have been
[1:34:06] ordained you have been called for this
[1:34:09] hour and there's great favor about your
[1:34:12] life because you are the aged the people
[1:34:17] the time to bring forth the promised son
[1:34:23] but to do that there has to be an angel
[1:34:26] here and I bring a message so therefore
[1:34:31] in 1946 the world is stunned by the
[1:34:37] claims of a little Kentucky preacher as
[1:34:42] they see it vindicated a syndicated
[1:34:47] sealed of vindicating
[1:34:49] by signs and wonders as an angel comes
[1:34:53] to humble men of God little did we know
[1:34:58] but that coming would be manifesting and
[1:35:01] we would see in the coming of that
[1:35:04] ministry we would see both the Ministry
[1:35:08] of Elijah as John the Baptist the
[1:35:11] forerunner and the Ministry of Christ
[1:35:13] all wrapped up in one messenger and
[1:35:17] vindicated by signs and wonders now what
[1:35:21] do I want to get a picture now remember
[1:35:24] there in the days of Jesus it would be
[1:35:28] it would be John and Jesus but I want
[1:35:32] you to know in this ministry meanest day
[1:35:34] it would be both ministries the Ministry
[1:35:38] of John a prophet and the Ministry of
[1:35:42] Christ wrapped up in one ministry
[1:35:45] as God promised that in the days of the
[1:35:50] voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:35:52] begins to sound that mystery of God
[1:35:54] would be finished now and he said now as
[1:36:00] Moses was given two signs the angel as I
[1:36:04] said would appear in brother Branham at
[1:36:07] the age of 37 and there in an old cabin
[1:36:13] speaking to an angel here here this
[1:36:17] angel would appear he would walk light
[1:36:20] would shine walk headed a 200-pound like
[1:36:23] man standing with his arms folded no
[1:36:27] beard hair down his shoulder olive
[1:36:30] complexion and look there and brother
[1:36:33] Branham the same I've come to tell you
[1:36:34] about your misunderstood life in your
[1:36:37] mysterious ways don't fear I'm sent from
[1:36:42] the presence of God and he would be in
[1:36:47] explain to him and give him his
[1:36:50] commission and said as Moses was given
[1:36:54] to sign now why is Muslim because we're
[1:36:57] in the nether Exodus remember the first
[1:37:00] Easter reached is really Passover so the
[1:37:04] first Passover was in Egypt come on now
[1:37:08] your your next Passover which is of
[1:37:11] significance is now in in Jerusalem and
[1:37:16] there at the Passover the land the true
[1:37:20] Lamb of God is offered but I want you to
[1:37:23] know we're in another Easter a man
[1:37:27] without that Easter back yonder in the
[1:37:31] days of Moses Jesus would not have been
[1:37:33] possible there had to be a people that
[1:37:37] were expecting the Messiah there had to
[1:37:39] be laws that were given out of whom
[1:37:41] would come a virgin there had to be
[1:37:43] everything set in place for the Messiah
[1:37:46] to come somebody with me then that pie
[1:37:49] that Passover gave way
[1:37:51] another Passover now here we are in
[1:37:53] another Passover amen today is another
[1:37:57] Easter as I'm saying as I'm preaching
[1:37:59] it's his their church I'm out I'm here
[1:38:05] now in this time an angel comes and he
[1:38:10] gives two signs as he gave to Moses he
[1:38:13] said now you got to get the people to
[1:38:14] believe and these signs are going to be
[1:38:17] to get you people to believe and to get
[1:38:22] them out of Egypt into the Promised Land
[1:38:24] and so the sign would now be given and
[1:38:28] and the first was a sign in his hand as
[1:38:31] he would take the the the person by
[1:38:36] their Allah by their right hand and he
[1:38:39] would hold it with his left and it would
[1:38:41] show a sign in the hand as Moses would
[1:38:44] show the sign in the hand puts it in the
[1:38:46] bosom and out comes leprosy and put it
[1:38:49] back in and then it's healed and and so
[1:38:54] this would be the sign and he says but
[1:38:57] if they don't believe the first time
[1:38:58] that we'll believe the second side and
[1:39:01] the angel tells them and the second sign
[1:39:05] will be greater than the verse you'll
[1:39:08] stay humble and sincere it will come to
[1:39:10] pass you'll be able to tell about these
[1:39:12] and the very secrets of the heart and
[1:39:15] then the people will have to believe you
[1:39:18] a man this will initiate the gospel in
[1:39:22] power I want you to get these word this
[1:39:25] will initiate the gospel in power that
[1:39:29] will bring on the second coming of
[1:39:31] Christ a man an Angels visit initiate
[1:39:37] the second coming as an angel visit you
[1:39:43] know initiated the coming there to
[1:39:45] sakurai a--
[1:39:46] now an angel comes in and initiate the
[1:39:50] coming with signs and wonders trying to
[1:39:54] get our hearts to believing a man come
[1:39:58] on Sarah before you can receive your
[1:40:00] brother your promised son you got
[1:40:03] start believing hey man you got to be
[1:40:05] turned from unbelief to faith come on
[1:40:09] you got to start believing your the
[1:40:12] people is coming through a man that the
[1:40:15] promise is yours and this coming of the
[1:40:18] angel assured us in to the coming of the
[1:40:22] Lord
[1:40:22] it had initiated showing us a Christ was
[1:40:26] back in the church doing the same things
[1:40:30] he did when he was here 2000 years ago
[1:40:33] this is what Jack lor are you know a
[1:40:37] friend of my family that we went to his
[1:40:40] church when I was a boy and visited
[1:40:42] there and was in brother Bibles meetings
[1:40:44] but he would write and he would say
[1:40:47] these words Bible days are here again
[1:40:51] here's a man that not only not only does
[1:40:55] he preach what we preach but he
[1:40:59] demonstrates what we preach he practices
[1:41:03] he's actually as I say happening what
[1:41:07] we've been preaching what was it God was
[1:41:12] showing us in crisis back in the church
[1:41:14] again after doing the same things that
[1:41:17] he did 2,000 years ago making those
[1:41:21] preachers declare Bible days are here
[1:41:24] again and that resurrection was and a
[1:41:29] resurrection was happening out of DOC
[1:41:31] dead denominationalism and signs and
[1:41:35] wonders were being done in the name of
[1:41:38] Jesus Christ and as Moses was given new
[1:41:42] signs of God had promised to give two
[1:41:44] signs that show that Jesus Christ was
[1:41:47] here present not a dead God not a
[1:41:53] ritualistic form but Jesus Christ the
[1:41:56] same yesterday today and forever 1946 it
[1:42:01] went out with the first sign in the hand
[1:42:04] and then then and the announcement of
[1:42:07] the angel of all the ministries that
[1:42:10] went out only William Branham could say
[1:42:12] I
[1:42:14] a gift that was ordained and
[1:42:15] administered to me by an angel only
[1:42:19] night after night was the pillar of fire
[1:42:23] present in his meetings
[1:42:25] night after night it would show he was
[1:42:28] present like I said you know some people
[1:42:31] actually saw it some people saw the form
[1:42:34] of an angel some saw the pillar of fire
[1:42:36] one thing they all had to say is nothing
[1:42:40] but the truth
[1:42:40] it never fails it always happens right
[1:42:47] amen what he says is always the truth
[1:42:52] and then there's not a margin of error
[1:42:54] in it that's what they all had to say
[1:42:57] but maybe but there were others like me
[1:43:00] I didn't see the angel I didn't see the
[1:43:03] light but I saw the effects I saw it as
[1:43:08] people were were changed by the presence
[1:43:11] of the angel and their height was
[1:43:13] discerned and they're there they're
[1:43:17] there they're very they're very facial
[1:43:24] expressions were things as they come
[1:43:27] into the presence of that angel and
[1:43:30] there was the announcement of the angel
[1:43:34] that and then the blind could see and
[1:43:37] the Deaf could hear and those were
[1:43:39] imprisoned were set free as crippled
[1:43:41] walked and deaf heard and cancers were
[1:43:44] delivered and I want to just make you
[1:43:47] remember God specifically made sure we
[1:43:51] understood that cancer is defeated that
[1:43:56] nothing can stand before our prayers
[1:43:59] when we believe that even cancer the
[1:44:03] first sign had been existence for nearly
[1:44:06] 3 years the blind could see that deaf
[1:44:09] heard cancers healed all kinds of
[1:44:12] inconceivable miracles would happen 19
[1:44:18] on July 24th in 1949 in Regina Cesc
[1:44:24] Saskatchewan before 10,000 people
[1:44:28] at night a middle-aged woman stood
[1:44:30] before brother branham the pillar of
[1:44:34] fire was hanging over brother branham
[1:44:37] could see that melon light and said she
[1:44:41] noticed she was anxious and a bit
[1:44:43] nervous and now don't be nervous
[1:44:45] that's the presence of the Lord and
[1:44:49] suddenly as he was speaking to her
[1:44:52] trying to reassure her a vision broke
[1:44:56] and and she began moving further away
[1:45:02] from him he said I see becoming much
[1:45:07] younger than this
[1:45:09] oh you're it's like a now a classroom
[1:45:16] lights you and you're sitting at a
[1:45:18] school desk and oh there's a pin comes
[1:45:25] flying across the room and strikes you
[1:45:27] in the eye and you have been blind ever
[1:45:30] since in that eye and the woman began to
[1:45:36] scream out and says you know that was me
[1:45:40] I was not me I was that little girl I've
[1:45:43] been buying them in my eyes since a
[1:45:45] little child yes she settled down a
[1:45:49] minute because that jolted him out of
[1:45:51] the vision brother Branham suddenly was
[1:45:54] back in the world of the auditorium
[1:45:57] Darren stood for a moment and then the
[1:46:01] vision began again he said I see you
[1:46:03] again you're you're again much younger
[1:46:07] than you are now but older than what you
[1:46:10] were there I you you used to wear your
[1:46:13] hair and braids and he said I see the
[1:46:16] braids and the ribbons around the two
[1:46:18] braids all he says I see a yellow dog
[1:46:21] now comes running after you and you're
[1:46:23] scared and you're running and you're
[1:46:26] running up some steps and and then just
[1:46:29] as you get it on the porch an older
[1:46:32] woman looks like your mother opens up
[1:46:35] the door and you you run inside
[1:46:37] and she screams out I was me brother
[1:46:40] branham ah I haven't thought of that for
[1:46:42] years and again her exclamation brought
[1:46:46] him out of the vision and as he stood
[1:46:49] there for a moment looking back looking
[1:46:52] around looked down at her hand he was
[1:46:55] holding he says I see you now I see how
[1:47:01] to see a lady walking very slowly very
[1:47:04] slowly sister it's you you're struggling
[1:47:06] to climb some steps at a white house
[1:47:09] there's something wrong with your back I
[1:47:11] see you can't get up those steps and now
[1:47:15] let's see you lean over a flowerbed to
[1:47:17] your right and you're crying and you
[1:47:20] said if I can ever get to brother
[1:47:22] Brandon's meeting it'll all be over and
[1:47:25] at that at that moment the woman fainted
[1:47:28] on the platform but something
[1:47:34] uh sure standing by Carter and gently
[1:47:36] helped her to the floor and that moment
[1:47:40] brother Baxter runs to there are
[1:47:41] microphones at brother Branham this is
[1:47:43] the second side the aides have told you
[1:47:45] about God is visiting his people and and
[1:47:54] suddenly the woman they're laying on the
[1:47:57] platform sits up in there and gets up
[1:48:01] off her feet and then she her eye
[1:48:05] suddenly becomes open and she can see it
[1:48:08] and she runs up the platform dancing and
[1:48:11] shouting around he'll young man jumps up
[1:48:16] out of there out of the audience he
[1:48:19] hobbles up on crutches toward the
[1:48:21] platform and then and I should stop him
[1:48:25] and saying brother Brandon kindly says
[1:48:27] to him such a same boy you have to get
[1:48:29] back and get a prayer card and wait your
[1:48:31] turn and the boy the young man bag
[1:48:34] didn't just tell me what the new brother
[1:48:36] branham that's all I want you to tell me
[1:48:38] what to do and brother brain cell i I
[1:48:40] don't know what to tell you and his
[1:48:46] voice kind of trailed off suddenly he
[1:48:49] saw a bus
[1:48:51] with Regina beach beach prominently
[1:48:55] displayed over the front windshield he
[1:48:59] said you've come from Regina Beach this
[1:49:02] morning didn't you
[1:49:03] and you came by bus and I see a man or a
[1:49:07] woman telling you that you can't go you
[1:49:11] said it's your mother and your father
[1:49:13] he's the boy said that's right I see
[1:49:16] another man who who looks like your
[1:49:18] father loaning you some money enough to
[1:49:19] make the trips and yes that was my uncle
[1:49:22] now see you in a room looking out of a
[1:49:25] bay window he said that was my house my
[1:49:27] aunt's house brother Brandon what must I
[1:49:30] do said do you believe with all your
[1:49:32] heart he said yes I believe with all my
[1:49:34] heart Jesus Christ is here he said then
[1:49:37] drop your crutches and stand on your
[1:49:38] feet
[1:49:39] Jesus Christ has healed you down went to
[1:49:42] both crutches clattering on the floor
[1:49:44] and he took one step two three hands
[1:49:47] raised in air and he went shouting
[1:49:49] giving God praise and the crowd went to
[1:49:51] a frenzied craziness and and and you see
[1:49:55] it came to pass just like God said to
[1:49:58] Moses if it will come to pass if they
[1:50:00] don't believe the first sign a man
[1:50:03] though they will hire hearken to its
[1:50:05] voice that will believe the voice of the
[1:50:07] latter sign and I don't want to tell you
[1:50:11] search it was all done to get us to be
[1:50:15] to be able to recognize like we do with
[1:50:19] the windmills that the wind is blowing
[1:50:21] coach the tree is moving and because we
[1:50:23] saw time after time after time that God
[1:50:27] was moving in the church it showed us
[1:50:31] he's here he's here he's here he's
[1:50:34] present he's present are you with me and
[1:50:38] that now this was more than one of the
[1:50:40] nine spiritual gifts that any believer
[1:50:42] can have this wasn't a word of knowledge
[1:50:44] it was a sign to get the people to
[1:50:47] believe the message and it's the same
[1:50:50] sign that Jesus used to get the people
[1:50:53] to recognize his Messiahship it fits
[1:50:57] exactly the Ministry of Jesus Christ now
[1:51:02] notice it was the men
[1:51:04] three of john the baptists but now it's
[1:51:09] also the ministry of christ notice
[1:51:12] because it's exact ministry Jesus said
[1:51:15] in John 5:19 the son can do nothing of
[1:51:18] himself but what he seeth the father do
[1:51:20] which means Jesus saw its miracle before
[1:51:23] the fact and what not because to
[1:51:26] Almighty God the future in the past were
[1:51:30] just as clear as the present you
[1:51:34] remember in the Bible and Jesus needed
[1:51:36] to eat the Passover he sent Peter and
[1:51:40] John ahead and he said go go to the city
[1:51:44] you're gonna meet a man with a picture
[1:51:46] of water go follow him wherever he goes
[1:51:49] in you say to him good men of the house
[1:51:52] now the master says where is the guest
[1:51:55] chamber where I shall eat the Passover
[1:51:58] with my disciples and he'll show you a
[1:52:00] large upper room furnished and prepared
[1:52:02] there made ready for us saying they
[1:52:06] would happen when Philip brought his
[1:52:09] brother Nathanael to the master jesus
[1:52:12] said of him behold an Israelite in whom
[1:52:14] there is no guile Nathanael said them
[1:52:18] where did you know me what do you know
[1:52:21] about me my certainty show up before
[1:52:23] Philip called you onto the victory I
[1:52:25] sell you and these visions would give
[1:52:29] Jesus penetrating insight that he could
[1:52:32] see the past as easy as the future John
[1:52:36] what one declares that Jesus was the
[1:52:39] Word made flesh Hebrews four and twelve
[1:52:43] says for the word of God is quick and
[1:52:46] that means alive and powerful and
[1:52:49] sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:52:51] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[1:52:54] the soul and spirit and of the joints
[1:52:57] and tomorrow and is a discerner of the
[1:52:59] thoughts and the intents of heart and
[1:53:01] neither is there any creature that is
[1:53:04] not manifest in his sight but all things
[1:53:06] are naked and open unto the eyes of him
[1:53:09] with whom we have to do Jesus met the
[1:53:13] woman at the well because the V
[1:53:17] made it necessary to go through Samaria
[1:53:20] he started out on a conversation with
[1:53:23] her he asked her for a drink he talked
[1:53:27] to her long enough to catch her spirit
[1:53:29] and then he said bring your husband and
[1:53:32] come here and she said why don't have a
[1:53:35] husband he said but you had five and the
[1:53:38] one you're living with is not your
[1:53:39] husband and astonished she says well
[1:53:43] well you know I perceive your prophet
[1:53:45] you know I know when the Messiah comes
[1:53:48] he's here which is a call to Christ he
[1:53:51] will tell us these things and and he is
[1:53:55] she he said I'm he and you see this was
[1:53:59] a sign of the Prophet you know we will
[1:54:02] the the minor parts of the story but
[1:54:06] maybe the whole story went perhaps Jesus
[1:54:10] even named the names of all the men that
[1:54:12] she had been with and why did she left
[1:54:16] him and are unworthy feelings that she
[1:54:18] had and all the abuse and the things
[1:54:21] that she'd went through because we'll
[1:54:23] only get a little snapshot of it but
[1:54:25] Jesus had told her enough that she knew
[1:54:28] a man that this was the Messiah that she
[1:54:32] recognized from the side side and Jesus
[1:54:36] said I am he now this was the sign of a
[1:54:39] prophet but this was also the sign of a
[1:54:43] messiah and Jen brother Branham was a
[1:54:47] prophet and the gift identified him as
[1:54:51] such are you with me Amen but he wasn't
[1:54:55] the Messiah they my mother shewed that
[1:54:58] the Messiah was present the word was
[1:55:02] present and a prophet had come to show
[1:55:04] the world that Christ indeed is alive
[1:55:07] and there's no two McMahon can hold him
[1:55:11] hallelujah
[1:55:13] if I look back at the tightness for a
[1:55:15] moment and the types and the shadows
[1:55:18] before us there was Abraham received
[1:55:21] promise after promise after promise as
[1:55:24] Israel hath received prophets and kings
[1:55:26] and prophets and great man
[1:55:28] water and man Abraham and recei promise
[1:55:31] after promise he was justified called
[1:55:34] out from the heathen sanctify taught how
[1:55:37] to build an altar and all for blood back
[1:55:39] to God he there received the Holy Ghost
[1:55:41] in tight under L said I entitled the
[1:55:44] Holy Ghost receives a new name no longer
[1:55:47] called Abram but Abraham and Manion then
[1:55:51] God comes down in the form of the man
[1:55:57] under the trees of memory and there the
[1:56:02] mysteries are revealed he tells him what
[1:56:05] will happen down in Sodom he tells him
[1:56:08] about the resurrection the the eastern
[1:56:11] that's promised to Sarah come on stay
[1:56:14] focus a man aids he tells him about all
[1:56:18] of these things that that are happening
[1:56:20] and says okay
[1:56:22] Sarah you're gonna happen Easter Sodom
[1:56:25] you're gonna have a burning what you're
[1:56:27] gonna be called out a map you be called
[1:56:33] out of the tribulation Abraham Sarah you
[1:56:37] won't even have a part in the
[1:56:38] tribulation hallelujah I'm out there the
[1:56:43] mysteries are revealed
[1:56:44] judgment is pronounced Sarah's heart is
[1:56:48] discerned and the message that the
[1:56:51] promised son comes to her let's look at
[1:56:54] it in Genesis 18 and 9 I don't think it
[1:56:57] even if it seemingly slows us down for a
[1:57:00] minute to read I think it's still
[1:57:02] pertinent to read the Word of God
[1:57:03] Genesis Aidan 18 and 9 and they said in
[1:57:06] him where is Sarah thy wife and he said
[1:57:09] behold in the tent and he said I will
[1:57:12] certainly turn under the return unto
[1:57:16] thee according to the time of life and
[1:57:18] lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[1:57:21] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[1:57:24] was behind him now Abraham and Sarah
[1:57:27] were old and we'll stricken in age and
[1:57:30] it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[1:57:34] manner of women therefore Sarah laughed
[1:57:37] within herself saying that's why I'm
[1:57:39] waxed old shall I play
[1:57:41] and with my lord being old also and the
[1:57:45] Lord said I name of him were for did
[1:57:48] Sarah laugh saying I shall I of Shirdi
[1:57:52] bear a child which alone is there
[1:57:55] anything too hard for the Lord that's
[1:57:58] the question you got answer at that time
[1:58:00] at the time appointed I will return unto
[1:58:05] thee according to the time of life and
[1:58:10] Sarah shall have a son hey man I want
[1:58:16] you to hear the words that are pepp
[1:58:21] eternally are you with me now I might
[1:58:25] pay real close attention the angel had
[1:58:28] visited the angel was telling of the
[1:58:31] bringing a message Sarah you're gonna
[1:58:34] have a child Church you're going in the
[1:58:36] rapture a man
[1:58:39] Sarah's wondering how is this going to
[1:58:40] be we haven't had a move of God that
[1:58:44] would really give us rapture and faith
[1:58:45] all of these years amen now I'm old how
[1:58:49] can I ever have that kind of pleasure
[1:58:51] come on a man here she's here a
[1:58:55] condition of unbelief fearing it'll
[1:58:59] never happen it'll never happen
[1:59:01] oh it's just words or it's slow as the
[1:59:04] second coming of Christ all kinds of
[1:59:06] jokes are being made about it but now
[1:59:11] here appears an angel are you with me
[1:59:15] and an angel starts initiating the
[1:59:20] coming of the son hallelujah
[1:59:24] and he does it with a message remark now
[1:59:30] he's got to turn Sarah's heart so he
[1:59:33] discerns her heart he tells us what
[1:59:36] she's been thinking in the tent behind
[1:59:39] him right now notice it's the same thing
[1:59:46] it's the Messiah side discerning the
[1:59:49] thoughts it's showing the word is not
[1:59:52] present
[1:59:52] and the word now reveals the mystery of
[1:59:55] Sara the mystery of Sodom the mystery of
[1:59:59] lot hey man
[2:00:03] but I want to get something to that that
[2:00:07] is said twice in here let's go back in
[2:00:10] this and I want you to see this and he
[2:00:14] says in verse 10 and I will certainly
[2:00:16] return under the according to the time
[2:00:20] of life so now he promises the Sun he
[2:00:26] gives a promise but he promises they
[2:00:28] return now if you look down here I'm
[2:00:32] talking about the angel that the angel
[2:00:34] promises I'll return then he comes there
[2:00:37] and he says it's anything too hard for
[2:00:38] the Lord verse 14 at the time appointed
[2:00:41] I will return now when God says
[2:00:45] something twice that means like Jesus
[2:00:48] did say verily verily he is emphasizing
[2:00:51] he is making an oath he is making an
[2:00:54] irrevocable promise oh man now church I
[2:00:59] want you to understand we're here at the
[2:01:02] end time
[2:01:03] Sarah was having an Easter she was
[2:01:07] having a resurrection come on she was
[2:01:10] having a change it was a season of
[2:01:13] change it was a time of a birth of a
[2:01:16] child or you hear me
[2:01:18] an angel was announcing that he was
[2:01:20] coming hallelujah amen but now notice
[2:01:26] now let's bring it down to our time
[2:01:28] we're at a profit we are about an angel
[2:01:31] come we have had a message and it is
[2:01:36] said it is said you're going to bring
[2:01:38] for the child a man and we've been
[2:01:41] grappling with our unbelief who me how
[2:01:43] could we do it in this ages so what
[2:01:45] stage there is and lookie here Laodicea
[2:01:48] look at all what's going on look at the
[2:01:50] trouble in the laughs look at the
[2:01:51] problems everywhere it's an age of
[2:01:56] greater unbelief but God starts doing
[2:02:00] things to get us to believe in
[2:02:02] he sends signs and wonders he sends
[2:02:06] prophets come on he sends a an angel
[2:02:09] with the message to turn our hearts back
[2:02:12] to believe him again because we gotta
[2:02:16] get Sarah to believer before the
[2:02:19] promised son can come Alleluia now we've
[2:02:24] had all of that and let me tell you
[2:02:27] something friends we are in the time the
[2:02:31] appointed time of the Angels reappearing
[2:02:42] what you are seeing in the world today
[2:02:45] as you see demon powers moving you see
[2:02:51] the lens of storm shutting down the
[2:02:54] world you see things that are happening
[2:02:58] out there and the news is only telling
[2:03:03] you what death is doing but the
[2:03:11] instrument is not about death it's about
[2:03:16] life and the Easter message is saying if
[2:03:22] you see death then you know there's got
[2:03:25] to come to life and if you see Satan and
[2:03:29] his angels at work in these demons and
[2:03:32] sickness and affliction then you got to
[2:03:34] see the angel of mercy and grace and
[2:03:37] love and the angel of promise and
[2:03:40] Michael who is like Jehovah stack on the
[2:03:43] behalf of his people you're only seeing
[2:03:48] half for the picture because that's how
[2:03:53] the world can tell you is what they see
[2:03:57] but I'm not seeing death I'm seeing life
[2:04:01] I'm seeing them Easter I'm seeing we are
[2:04:05] in the moment in the time
[2:04:08] frame of the angels return notice Nelson
[2:04:13] I'll bring it down when he came that
[2:04:16] when the angel come he revealed the
[2:04:18] mysteries he told about Sodom there was
[2:04:23] a message down to Sodom come on man
[2:04:28] there was a message of a rapture given a
[2:04:30] hope that is created a faith that is
[2:04:34] given remember when the angel comes
[2:04:37] again it's not even recorded it's not a
[2:04:41] public shel hallelujah the world don't
[2:04:46] even know about it it is just a
[2:04:50] reappearance of the angel at the
[2:04:52] appointed time hallelujah a man I'm
[2:04:57] telling you we are in the moment of time
[2:05:01] of the returning of the angel not to
[2:05:04] bring more mysteries not to bring more
[2:05:07] teaching but to bring life and the body
[2:05:10] to closer dynamics even the calm because
[2:05:14] of the faith that is working up in
[2:05:17] Sarah's heart
[2:05:19] Sarah will come to you the important
[2:05:25] time and you will have an Easter you
[2:05:28] will have a restoration hour and a
[2:05:32] resurrection from that old dead form
[2:05:35] you've been here you've been dead all of
[2:05:37] these years but now I met life is in the
[2:05:40] body Alleluia
[2:05:44] I believe the signs and the healing and
[2:05:49] the rejoicing that we have been
[2:05:51] experienced our Easter signs when you go
[2:05:56] out and you listen in the morning I like
[2:06:00] to go out in the early morning sit on my
[2:06:02] porch and hear all the rejoicing of the
[2:06:05] birds and the singing that is going on
[2:06:09] and I look and I see the signs of
[2:06:12] healing to nature Oh trees that have
[2:06:15] been dead throughout the winter and if
[2:06:19] in a dormant stage is now pretty
[2:06:22] important new life a math hallelujah and
[2:06:27] I see signs of healing and rejoicing
[2:06:30] those are Easter science but I want to
[2:06:34] say the signs of healing and rejoicing
[2:06:37] that we are seeing among us our Easter
[2:06:40] signs it's a sign that the bride is
[2:06:44] receiving strength last night we watched
[2:06:50] a 2014 service at youth camp as we
[2:06:54] watched back in what was it to 13 and
[2:06:57] when and then I miss different ones I
[2:07:01] don't remember them all but anyway we've

[2:07:48] tell you any story is not a myth it's
[2:07:51] not a bunny story it's not a hippity-hop
[2:07:53] of the bunny traps and you might think
[2:07:56] that's cute I don't think it's cute no
[2:07:59] more than putting your child in Santa
[2:08:02] Clauses lap I meant but the church's
[2:08:05] backslidden that have lost the power of
[2:08:08] God and the real meaning of Easter a man
[2:08:12] but in sir to us is an Easter eggs and
[2:08:15] bunny rabbits and little ducks and
[2:08:17] little chicks but you know like the

[2:12:22] called back in to pray for a little girl
[2:12:25] in a wheelchair with limbs all deformed
[2:12:28] and crippled up and there as he prays
[2:12:31] for her
[2:12:32] the
[2:12:33] snap apart and come apartment a little
[2:12:35] girl walks for the glory of God
[2:12:37] why did that happen is he star today
[2:12:48] sister Lana's hair is back she don't
[2:12:52] have to be wearing a camp that's a sign
[2:12:54] of death she's wearing the glory that's
[2:12:57] a sign of life hey man we watched Esther
[2:13:03] last night come through the prayer line
[2:13:06] a mountain

[2:13:16] night she had written on the bottom of
[2:13:18] her the soles of her shoes infertility
[2:13:23] and went through that prayer line she
[2:13:28] showed us a picture of her shoes today

[2:13:33] wrote infertility on the shoes it's gone
[2:13:38] not only is it's gone she's pregnant I
[2:13:42] meant out there there's something more
[2:13:45] than a chick or duck or a boiled egg or
[2:13:49] bunny tree a man that's life is in the
[2:13:54] body a man it's that Barren womb that we
[2:13:58] pray and why was it because an angel

[2:14:44] Jessica Martin come through and as a
[2:14:48] part of that vision she come through the

[2:14:58] prayer line and he stops and says I have
[2:15:02] a word how the Lord for you

[2:15:09] and I would go to meeting little later
[2:15:11] in time I'm not sure exactly when but he
[2:15:14] feels the boy gives a testimony actually
[2:15:19] his wife gives a testimony both of them
[2:15:21] give a testimony of how that God saved
[2:15:25] them but anyway Caleb comes coming side
[2:15:28] and is invited to the meeting decides to
[2:15:32] come that night got ministers got
[2:15:34] brother Timothy brother Tim and and they
[2:15:37] come to the meeting and in that meeting

[2:15:51] Easter a man Caleb you don't have to

[2:15:58] have an Easter be resurrected from death
[2:16:01] into life are you with me hey man Oh
[2:16:05] mind you don't tell my thing after team
[2:16:08] that we could talk about today we're
[2:16:10] cops signs of life is a fondest pride
[2:16:14] I hear men minister sincere they can be
[2:16:19] trying their hardest to put the quotes
[2:16:22] together try to understand their miss
[2:16:24] applying things taking things brother
[2:16:26] Branham said before it was divided and
[2:16:29] given to the 144,000 in the church
[2:16:31] instead of the bride and said about the
[2:16:33] plagues and so on like that and they got
[2:16:35] it all misconstrued
[2:16:38] and they see we're brother Benson we
[2:16:40] need to move of the Holy Ghost and then
[2:16:42] they turn it around and say you see but
[2:16:44] it's a teaching and I say Church it's
[2:16:47] not a teaching the messenger came with
[2:16:52] the message and the teaching has been
[2:16:55] given the return of the angel does not
[2:17:00] bring teaching come on
[2:17:02] it brings life to Sarah amen it causes
[2:17:09] her a culmination of events that causes
[2:17:14] her to judge him faithful who had
[2:17:17] promised and I want you while you're
[2:17:20] sitting there quarantined in your own
[2:17:22] home think about these things right now
[2:17:25] a man that an angel has visited our
[2:17:28] generation to initiate to come in the
[2:17:31] Lord and that angel has not lost
[2:17:33] interest the angel is present hallelujah
[2:17:38] and I want to just say as we saw in the
[2:17:41] Mauro peninsular the angel still sits on
[2:17:45] the stone did you notice he rolled away
[2:17:50] the stone and he sat on the stone hey
[2:17:56] man what was that signify now back we'll
[2:18:00] ever take this stone and close up the
[2:18:04] tomb again sealing Christ away and I
[2:18:08] want you to know what's this message has
[2:18:10] been released it cannot ever go back it
[2:18:14] can only go into fulfillment a man held
[2:18:18] did his best to hold Jesus in the tomb
[2:18:20] the grave did his best to corruptive but
[2:18:23] it's Easter a man Easter proved he was
[2:18:27] not only the world but he was God and
[2:18:30] scepter dynamics in the word God is
[2:18:34] still God as I'm trying to bring this
[2:18:37] down to close today I want to say God is
[2:18:39] still God the sign of the Son of man
[2:18:42] showed us the Word was here in power
[2:18:46] that it was not just dead by theology
[2:18:49] but it was something that lived now the
[2:18:53] office of son of man prophet is not here
[2:18:57] but the Ministry of the son of man
[2:18:58] continues notice the angel said I will
[2:19:04] come again I will visit again I will
[2:19:07] come to you brother Branham says I
[2:19:10] challenge you to believe that Jesus
[2:19:13] Christ is revealed in the form of son of
[2:19:15] man and human flesh through the bog
[2:19:18] through the bride's body look where he's
[2:19:20] revealing Sethna through the bride's
[2:19:23] body now why why why not the bride's
[2:19:29] body you know we've been talking about
[2:19:32] the minister Christ being displayed and
[2:19:35] we talked about a prophet and eminent
[2:19:38] him demonstrate in the Ministry of
[2:19:40] Christ but let's go back in the day
[2:19:43] where Jesus what's that God prophet and
[2:19:46] his ministry was manifested in Christ
[2:19:51] right but I want you to know that they
[2:19:54] have Pentecost it was not another spirit
[2:19:57] somebody help me preach it was the same
[2:20:00] spirit that was in Jesus not another
[2:20:04] Jesus the same Jesus comes again in
[2:20:07] another form to cook to dwell in another
[2:20:11] body to work in another body and to
[2:20:14] finish the work in another body the same
[2:20:17] Jesus remember now is God in his people
[2:20:21] and what we saw was the Ministry of
[2:20:24] Christ the word brought to us to a
[2:20:26] prophet in a prophetic office is no
[2:20:29] longer happened in that way
[2:20:31] amen now it is being manifested in a
[2:20:34] broad body worldwide amen so indifferent
[2:20:39] the traditions of men as dead and the
[2:20:42] Holy Spirit is right among us now giving
[2:20:44] us life you see the angel vindicated
[2:20:48] this over and over again for us so we
[2:20:50] can be sure and see his resurrection
[2:20:52] sign and I want to say today the clouds
[2:20:55] may have obscured the
[2:20:57] said the Sun for a while my this morning
[2:21:01] when we went out it was a gloomy day the
[2:21:07] closer they as I backed out of my garage
[2:21:10] and backed out into it the day was so
[2:21:14] dark it was so dark
[2:21:20] we couldn't see the face of the Sun and
[2:21:26] the clouds may have obscured the face of
[2:21:30] the Sun for a while even the next day
[2:21:35] after the Angels visit maybe Sarah after
[2:21:39] hearing whatever maybe you don't even
[2:21:42] see a change in her but something's
[2:21:44] happening whether the day is now a good
[2:21:49] day or a bad day weather is robbers
[2:21:52] coming to drove off some of the sheep or
[2:21:55] didn't whether Sodom got worse and you
[2:21:57] hear miss burn and nothing changes she
[2:22:01] has received a message and there's
[2:22:05] something beginning to happen in her and
[2:22:08] it begins with her
[2:22:11] btv believe it not that this is for
[2:22:18] Hagar somebody else to fulfill but it's
[2:22:22] for me to fulfill and she begins to look
[2:22:27] about herself as the princess and she
[2:22:31] begins to dress like the princess
[2:22:34] because her name has been changed from
[2:22:37] Baron to princess and she begins to
[2:22:41] identify herself with the name she's
[2:22:44] called and now Abraham is calling her by
[2:22:48] the new name he's calling her princess
[2:22:51] hey princess will you bring me a cup of
[2:22:54] coffee this morning hey princess will
[2:22:56] you do this princess princess come sit

[2:23:44] cuz he said I'm a princess he changed my

[2:23:50] where she starts believing and judging
[2:23:52] him faithful oh could I get you today to
[2:23:55] stop judging him faithful you're looking
[2:23:58] and you're worried about how faithful

[2:28:00] what two hours into this yeah right up
[2:28:05] two hours let me bring it down to a
[2:28:09] close I want to bring you back to one of
[2:28:12] my devotions this week since this has
[2:28:16] been going on and as I was preparing my
[2:28:20] sermon this morning I was reminded of
[2:28:23] the time the only time that Easter was
[2:28:27] written in the Bible did you know Easter
[2:28:30] is only in there one time it was
[2:28:34] translated us because by the time King
[2:28:38] James translated the Bible into English
[2:28:40] language Easter which was actually the
[2:28:43] name of a moon God in the celebration of
[2:28:46] her birthday but by the time of King
[2:28:50] James translated the Bible into English
[2:28:53] the word Easter had become synonymous or
[2:28:57] interchangeable with the Passover and if
[2:29:01] you looked at the Greek word there it
[2:29:03] doesn't say Easter it says Passover and
[2:29:07] this was written in the book of Acts
[2:29:10] chapter 12 and the devil decided to
[2:29:15] persecute the church and killed James
[2:29:18] and had arrested Peter intended to bring
[2:29:22] him out for execution after Easter I men
[2:29:27] remembers that now look at our thing we
[2:29:30] have been going through Daniel 12
[2:29:32] Michael stands up we've been over in
[2:29:35] Revelation in in Revelation 12 where
[2:29:38] Michael fights the dragon
[2:29:41] now then we're over here in Acts chapter
[2:29:43] 12 and Acts chapter 12 it's Easter and
[2:29:49] the devil has his plans
[2:29:53] amen now what starts out with big plans
[2:29:58] for the devil ends pretty dismal and man
[2:30:02] oh yeah he starts with big plans he
[2:30:04] kills James he arrests Peter he's going
[2:30:06] to kill him and you know he's gonna stop
[2:30:09] the church and he you know all of this
[2:30:11] plans that he has and it ends up with
[2:30:13] Herod dead eaten with worms and the Word
[2:30:19] of God is multiplied every man I want
[2:30:23] you to look that chapter begins bad but
[2:30:26] it ends good it is that starts with
[2:30:31] Satan's got a scheme against the church
[2:30:34] but God's got another plan that you
[2:30:38] don't even see when Satan's plans moving
[2:30:40] around now so it's Easter and then Herod
[2:30:48] when arrested Peter going to bring him
[2:30:50] out for execution after Easter demons
[2:30:55] are gloating ah this was a great victory
[2:30:59] hell has delighted in James's death now
[2:31:04] he'll has moved to plan the death of
[2:31:09] Peter Peter hold has held the keys to
[2:31:14] the church which he delivers to the
[2:31:17] church on the day of Pentecost it's
[2:31:19] really too late because the keys is to
[2:31:21] open it has been given but he has plans
[2:31:24] for Peter but God has other plans would
[2:31:29] you to understand the devil may have
[2:31:31] plans for your life he may have you
[2:31:36] there and you're under a threat of death
[2:31:39] you're going to be executed but God's
[2:31:42] got other plans
[2:31:45] hallelujah now in the middle of this
[2:31:48] there's the church
[2:31:50] the church hears of Peters arrest you
[2:31:54] need there like Peters like those that
[2:31:57] are in the ward with Kovac 19 you know
[2:31:59] you can't get to them I read a people
[2:32:02] who dropped their husband their son
[2:32:05] their loved one off at the hospital for
[2:32:08] them to be taken into isolation never to
[2:32:10] be seen again put on a machine and dead
[2:32:12] body taken to the morgue crying I
[2:32:18] couldn't get to him I couldn't say the
[2:32:21] last goodbyes well given the last hug
[2:32:24] say the last tour Peter was in law and
[2:32:33] in isolation quarantined but there's a
[2:32:39] part that the church has got to play and
[2:32:42] what this happens is this causes the
[2:32:46] church to start praying now if you just
[2:32:51] stop and remember you're not here to
[2:32:55] learn how to use yourself felt better
[2:32:59] you're not even here for new soon
[2:33:02] program where you can just kind of cue
[2:33:04] in on everybody what everybody's doing
[2:33:06] it and I'm a better platform for social
[2:33:08] media you're not here for fun and games
[2:33:12] you're here you're here at a time and
[2:33:14] you've been called to a time of prayer
[2:33:17] type of consecration a time set aside
[2:33:24] the devil is threatened now to shut us
[2:33:27] down
[2:33:27] shut the world down but the churches
[2:33:32] part is to start praying calling on God
[2:33:36] for deliverance
[2:33:37] we need your deliverance we need the
[2:33:41] return of the angel
[2:33:44] look we saw the angel happen in the
[2:33:47] Zechariah to Mary
[2:33:50] we saw them to the Shepherd's we saw
[2:33:52] them we saw them strengthen Jesus there
[2:33:56] and a Gethsemane we see we see the angel
[2:33:59] he's good at the age
[2:34:01] heaven it is backing it up heaven is
[2:34:03] working heaven is working behind the
[2:34:06] scenes strengthen it helping the church
[2:34:08] he's there he's there I help and John
[2:34:11] and strengthening him giving him a
[2:34:14] message
[2:34:14] he's there anointing Jesus now Jesus is
[2:34:18] filled with the spirit and now at the
[2:34:20] Mount of temptation
[2:34:22] he's strengthened by angels and there
[2:34:24] and there and it just cemani
[2:34:26] strengthened by angels and now the Holy
[2:34:29] Spirit comes as a pillar of fire and the
[2:34:32] fire divides itself in the heavenly
[2:34:35] Spirit of God and gellick portions of
[2:34:38] God feel to every person with the Spirit
[2:34:41] of God but now Peter needs an angel
[2:34:52] because he's in an impossible situation
[2:34:55] preachers can't help him the other
[2:34:59] apostles can't help him nobody can get
[2:35:02] him out and the church starts praying
[2:35:04] and God sends an angel well now we don't
[2:35:09] pray to angels nor do we worship them
[2:35:12] but we do ask God to send deliverance
[2:35:15] and the Bible said and the angel of his
[2:35:19] presence saved them at times situations
[2:35:23] can look so bleak circumstances of life
[2:35:26] made it look so impossible that the
[2:35:29] devil has an upper hand but the power of
[2:35:33] prayer changes a situation a man from
[2:35:37] something bad there's something good
[2:35:39] look where it starts bad is good he's in
[2:35:44] prison no one can help him he's beyond
[2:35:46] the help of his friends they can't reach
[2:35:49] him physically he's under kept under
[2:35:51] constant watch not only is he imprisoned
[2:35:54] by an iron bars but he's in the inner
[2:35:57] prison behind now there will have to be
[2:36:00] several gates to go through he is not
[2:36:03] only there in that but there are is a
[2:36:06] quadrant of soldiers that are watching
[2:36:08] him there are two that are watching
[2:36:11] there are two that he's chained to
[2:36:15] there with that there is four quarter
[2:36:19] quarter and nuns where's that are
[2:36:21] commissioned to guard him all night and
[2:36:22] they will change out during the shifts
[2:36:26] of the night so that ever few hours he
[2:36:28] gets a fresh demonic visitation trying
[2:36:36] to hold even prison maybe there that way
[2:36:40] this morning sitting I can never give
[2:36:42] something comes in a way after wave
[2:36:45] after wave the news of James is death
[2:36:50] Saint will take that whisper in his ears
[2:36:53] all night long of what's going to happen
[2:36:56] in the morning you know there isn't
[2:36:59] there seems to be no Court of Appeal
[2:37:02] there's nothing but certain death
[2:37:05] because herring is only thinking of his
[2:37:08] own popularity that he's found with the
[2:37:10] Jews by killing James ever devil ever
[2:37:14] demon is clean fully wrapping their
[2:37:16] hands together and waiting for the
[2:37:18] moment that this preacher would be dead
[2:37:25] just wait until after Easter after
[2:37:31] Easter we got plans for him
[2:37:37] just wait till after Easter
[2:37:42] suddenly in the darkness of the night
[2:37:46] there comes a whipping whirling fire as
[2:37:51] a light descending from the invisible
[2:37:53] realm of heavens dimension and comings
[2:37:56] into the visible realm of the room and
[2:37:59] out of the light steps an angel sound
[2:38:04] familiar
[2:38:05] danger commands for Peter to rise
[2:38:08] quickly he smites him on the side oh man
[2:38:12] oh my yeah we can just stop for a moment
[2:38:16] or may it be this morning to come to
[2:38:19] smile
[2:38:20] side of ever bright movement member a
[2:38:24] man and you have that awakening moment
[2:38:27] that the angel has returned that the
[2:38:30] angel is present we seem here is done
[2:38:34] this isn't that this isn't that don't
[2:38:38] forget in that service last night as it
[2:38:41] began out I've told about the visit to
[2:38:44] brother Ron's room where he was dying in
[2:38:46] the hospital
[2:38:47] I've told you of the supernatural
[2:38:49] visitation where God raised him up from
[2:38:52] a dead State hey man he had an Easter
[2:38:55] are you with me

[2:39:24] isn't dead but he's a living God and
[2:39:27] this is what happens when an angel
[2:39:29] sweeps through the world and a little
[2:39:32] eighteen month old boy gets off the
[2:39:34] middle of the floor by his self without
[2:39:36] pulling up on the bed and gets up and
[2:39:39] runs through the house because it's been
[2:39:45] seen in a vision and the Word of God can
