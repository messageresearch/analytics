[31:16] amen can you say that this evening lord
[31:19] i am
[31:19] nothing without you
[31:24] what a wonderful way to end 2020.
[31:29] gather together with friends and
[31:31] believers of light precious faith
[31:34] you know before we're seeded i'd i guess
[31:36] i'll say a little something about 2020.
[31:40] i suppose it's been a very different
[31:42] year for sure
[31:44] with all the things brought on by
[31:45] covid19 and
[31:47] probably not one we would have signed up
[31:48] for if we'd been given multiple choice
[31:51] i'll take the one without the pandemic
[31:53] thanks that's kind of where i would have
[31:56] went with my choice for many people i'm
[31:59] sure it's been a very difficult year i
[32:01] don't
[32:01] doubt that but i think what we've
[32:03] learned through the years is that trials
[32:05] and tribulations and hardships don't
[32:07] care what the calendar says
[32:09] you know they can hit your home even if
[32:13] the world says they're having a great
[32:14] year
[32:15] bad times can strike us bad times can
[32:18] can show up but you know folks tend to
[32:20] act like
[32:21] it's the worst year that's ever been on
[32:23] the face of the earth
[32:24] because of coven and i suppose that
[32:28] would be true if you'd never lived in
[32:30] any other period of history
[32:31] [Music]
[32:33] because just a little perspective i was
[32:35] looking at some things today and i saw
[32:37] that in the year 542 the justinian
[32:39] plague
[32:40] killed 25 million people
[32:43] the black death of 1350 killed 200
[32:47] million
[32:47] people the flu pandemic of 1918
[32:51] killed between 30 and 50 million people
[32:55] and these are pandemics that affected
[32:57] everyone christians non-christians alike
[33:00] but as i thought about that i also
[33:01] believe that we as christians
[33:03] shouldn't so easily forget what those
[33:05] who have gone before
[33:06] us have gone through for the sake of the
[33:09] faith
[33:10] for the cause of the faith many times we
[33:12] speak of persecution and we speak of
[33:14] hard times and we
[33:15] don't even know what we're talking about
[33:17] i suppose bad times are all relative to
[33:20] what time period you live in
[33:22] but brother brown would say we are told
[33:24] that the church was progressing all the
[33:26] time
[33:26] under persecution i crossed the river
[33:29] and went into rome and i went down to
[33:30] the san angelo's catacomb
[33:32] and while going through the catacombs
[33:33] and seeing the tombs where the bodies
[33:36] had been buried
[33:37] of the people that had died under
[33:38] persecution
[33:40] and the corners was little short graves
[33:42] those were the babies
[33:45] as i stood there my heart was moved and
[33:47] i raised my hands up to god
[33:49] i said god be merciful the gladiators
[33:52] said thumbs down but i'm saying hands up
[33:54] raise them up oh god and triumph at that
[33:56] last day
[33:58] for you promised you would do it that
[34:00] precious faith of the early church that
[34:02] was pure gold
[34:03] said the bible tried in the fire and how
[34:06] they would open the pits of that great
[34:08] arena
[34:09] setting like that only in the bleachers
[34:11] as we call it and
[34:13] the great massive place down here and
[34:15] they would burn them to the stake
[34:17] they would open the doors and traps of
[34:19] the hungry lions and tigers
[34:21] they would rush forth on a praying bunch
[34:24] of christians and just drag them from
[34:25] bone to bone
[34:27] and the faith of those people stood firm
[34:31] and in the midst of all that the church
[34:34] grew mightier all the time
[34:38] in the midst of all that look sure 2020
[34:40] isn't a year that we'd like to relive
[34:42] 2020 hasn't been a great year as some
[34:45] people might would say but it wasn't a
[34:46] year that should have shook us
[34:48] it wasn't a year that should have
[34:49] brought anxiety or should have brought
[34:51] fear or things upon us sure
[34:52] we've seen trials and we've seen trouble
[34:54] struggles in the year 2020
[34:56] but i'd like to stand here and say that
[34:58] the year 2020 was a year of miracles
[35:01] the year 2020 was a year of salvation a
[35:03] year of healing and a year of
[35:05] deliverance
[35:06] it was a time we walked through
[35:07] hardships but we can look back and say
[35:09] he walked right beside us
[35:11] every single step of the way he didn't
[35:14] leave us he didn't forsake us he's been
[35:16] there all along
[35:17] and he's going to be there in the
[35:18] morning when you wake up in 2021 and
[35:21] whatever comes our way then he's going
[35:22] to be right there
[35:24] because he promised he would never leave
[35:26] us he promised he would never forsake us
[35:29] sure 2020 saw satan unleash a pandemic
[35:33] to influence governments and political
[35:35] powers and to be the focal point of
[35:37] some of his last day schemes and yet the
[35:40] bride grew stronger
[35:42] our faith rooted deeper our love for him
[35:46] magnified and our trust in him
[35:49] solidified 2020 we found him true and we
[35:52] have found him faithful
[35:54] because it's in the darkest times that
[35:56] jesus shows up and it's in those times
[35:58] that the greatest victories are won so
[36:00] despite
[36:01] our difficulties despite our losses and
[36:03] despite
[36:04] satan's best efforts 2020 was a year of
[36:07] victory
[36:08] for god's people it was a year of
[36:10] overcome overcoming it was a year of
[36:11] taking another step forward it was
[36:13] another step
[36:14] closer home so today i say
[36:17] 2020 wasn't that bad i grew closer to
[36:20] the lord in 2020 because of some of the
[36:22] hardships i went through
[36:23] if you grew closer to the lord this year
[36:25] then it wasn't a failure it was a great
[36:27] year it was an awesome year and all
[36:28] things work together for good to them
[36:30] that love the lord
[36:32] and before we go to the bible i'd like
[36:33] to read this quote from brother branham
[36:35] just in case i forget to do it later
[36:37] he says and now beginning a new year i
[36:39] want to say not happy new year to you
[36:42] i want to say this to you god bless you
[36:46] and if he does that that's all you'll
[36:48] have need of for the coming year
[36:51] and i trust that he will i trust that
[36:53] god's blessings be upon you
[36:55] and your family as we head into this new
[36:57] year
[36:58] amen we're going to go to the word now
[37:01] and we're going to look in the book of
[37:03] esther the second chapter in the 15th
[37:06] verse
[37:11] thank you lord
[37:21] we will be reading a lot of scriptures
[37:23] tonight mostly from the book of
[37:24] esther we'll go through a majority of
[37:27] the book
[37:29] this evening and we'll do some skipping
[37:31] around
[37:32] but we're going to start right here in
[37:33] chapter 2 verse 15 and it says
[37:36] now when the turn of esther the daughter
[37:38] of abigail the uncle of mordecai
[37:40] who had taken her for his daughter was
[37:43] come to go
[37:44] in unto the king she required nothing
[37:47] but what haggai the king's chamberlain
[37:50] the keeper of the women appointed
[37:52] and esther obtained favor in the sight
[37:54] of all them
[37:55] that looked upon her so esther was taken
[37:58] in unto the king a hazarist
[38:00] into his house royal in the tenth month
[38:02] which is the month to beth
[38:04] in the seventh year of his reign and the
[38:07] king loved esther above
[38:08] all the women and she obtained grace and
[38:11] favor
[38:12] in his sight more than all the virgins
[38:15] so that he set the royal crown upon her
[38:17] head
[38:18] and made her queen instead of vashti
[38:22] we're also going to look over in
[38:23] revelation the third chapter
[38:26] revelation the third chapter we're going
[38:28] to read a couple of verses there
[38:30] we'll start in verse 11. revelation 3
[38:33] verse 11
[38:34] it says behold i come quickly hold that
[38:38] fast which thou hast that no man take
[38:40] that crown
[38:41] skip to verse 14 and unto the angel of
[38:44] the church of the laodiceans right
[38:46] these things saith the amen the faithful
[38:48] and true witness the beginning of the
[38:50] creation of god
[38:51] i know thy works that thou neither hold
[38:53] cold nor hot
[38:54] i would thou work cold or hot so then
[38:57] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[38:59] cold nor hot
[39:00] i will spew thee out of my mouth
[39:03] let's go to him now our gracious
[39:06] heavenly father lord we come before you
[39:08] on this last service of
[39:09] the year 2020. lord we just want to give
[39:12] you thanks for all that you've done for
[39:14] us in the year
[39:14] lord the miracles that we've seen the
[39:16] healings we've seen lord and all that
[39:18] you've done
[39:19] lord truly we see your hand upon our
[39:21] lives lord we've been a favored people
[39:23] lord we just want to say thank you lord
[39:26] many things may change in the coming
[39:27] year
[39:28] but there's one thing that i want to
[39:29] remain constant and one thing i want to
[39:31] remain the same is that you're going to
[39:32] hold our hand and lead us through
[39:34] lord just like you did this year lord
[39:36] because you promised you'd never leave
[39:38] us you'd never forsake us
[39:40] lord i just ask now for these next few
[39:42] moments of time that we're together lord
[39:43] that you'll anoint my lips and you'll
[39:45] anoint this service
[39:46] and lord that you'll speak to the hearts
[39:47] of your people lord i'm just asking you
[39:49] to come in a special way now lord in
[39:51] jesus name we pray
[39:53] amen you may have your seats
[39:59] the last two times that we spoke here we
[40:02] spoke about
[40:03] favor and the first time we spoke we
[40:06] spoke about an
[40:07] angel coming to mary to tell her that
[40:09] she was highly favored and
[40:11] and we went on with that and talked
[40:12] about how we also have received an
[40:14] angelic visitation
[40:15] with a message telling us that we are
[40:18] highly favored people
[40:19] and then in the next one we went and we
[40:21] spoke another part of that
[40:24] favored through your trials and we dealt
[40:26] with how circumstances of life
[40:28] do not change favor that god gives us
[40:31] we found that job was favored in his
[40:33] trials and that ruth was favored
[40:35] through her trials and you tonight no
[40:37] matter what you faced or what you're
[40:38] going to face
[40:40] you are highly favored of almighty god
[40:43] and tonight what we're going to to title
[40:45] this what we're going to speak on
[40:46] is favored to speak favored
[40:50] to speak as christians i believe that
[40:53] god's favor
[40:54] is everything to us i believe that that
[40:57] we strive to attain his favor we should
[40:59] strive to walk
[41:00] daily in the favor that he gives us
[41:03] because without his favor
[41:04] we can't make it without his favor we're
[41:06] nothing without his favor we would
[41:08] surely fail
[41:09] and he shows us his favor in many
[41:11] different ways
[41:12] he showed you favor when he came and
[41:14] died on the cross for you
[41:16] he showed us you favor when he forgave
[41:18] all your sins and he forgave all your
[41:19] trespasses and
[41:20] he shows us favor when he heals the sick
[41:23] when he saves the lost when he delivers
[41:25] the bound when he does those things
[41:26] that's god's favor
[41:28] in our lives it's god's favor when he
[41:30] blesses your daily life
[41:31] when he blesses your finances anything
[41:33] that you receive from him
[41:34] is god's favor upon your life
[41:38] and it's very important that we
[41:40] recognize that this is god's favor and
[41:42] we don't take these things for granted
[41:44] but we recognize where the blessings
[41:45] come from
[41:46] and we give god the thanks and praise
[41:48] that he deserves for
[41:49] that favor it was great favor that he
[41:52] sent us a message in this day
[41:54] many times maybe we forget to give god
[41:56] thanks for that but we want to say thank
[41:57] you lord for sending a message thank you
[41:59] for sending a light that brought us out
[42:01] of darkness
[42:01] thank you for the word of the hour that
[42:03] was god's favor
[42:05] in our life and it is a great step
[42:08] and it's an important step to accept
[42:11] god's favor that he has given you when
[42:13] he offers you favor yes that must be
[42:15] accepted
[42:17] in order to to operate from the position
[42:19] of authority that we have been given in
[42:21] this day
[42:22] we must recognize first and foremost
[42:24] that he has favored us
[42:26] you're never going to get to that place
[42:28] where you can operate there as long as
[42:29] you're wallowing in your past mistakes
[42:31] as long as you're worried about whether
[42:32] or not i'm good enough
[42:33] as long as you're worried about your own
[42:35] unworthiness and constantly speaking the
[42:37] devil's language you're never going to
[42:38] be able to operate
[42:39] from the position of authority that god
[42:42] is wanting you to operate from in this
[42:44] last day
[42:44] but you have to come to the point where
[42:46] you accept what the atonement has done
[42:48] for you
[42:49] you have to get to the point where you
[42:51] judge the lamb as being worthy
[42:53] and it was worthy enough to take away
[42:55] your sins it was worthy enough to take
[42:57] away your stains it was worthy enough to
[42:59] take away every mistake
[43:00] and wash it away and make it white as
[43:02] snow we
[43:03] judge the lamb worthy tonight we look at
[43:05] the atonement it was worthy tonight
[43:07] so we can quit looking unto ourselves
[43:10] and we can begin to look at what god's
[43:12] done for us and when we get to that
[43:13] point we can begin to operate
[43:15] where he wants us to operate from when
[43:18] you
[43:18] accept what the atonement has done for
[43:20] you
[43:21] however that is not the end of it
[43:25] see many people get there and they stop
[43:28] they see that they've been called
[43:30] they hear that they've been favored they
[43:32] see that they are forgiven and they
[43:34] accept that and that's the extent of it
[43:39] and then life goes on and then life
[43:42] happens and then they go to work and
[43:43] that's the end are you saved yes i'm
[43:45] safe
[43:45] and that's the end of it that's as far
[43:48] as they ever progress
[43:49] but there must be a continual seeking
[43:53] there is a continual walk a continual
[43:55] lord i want your favor lord i want more
[43:57] of you lord pour out yourself greater in
[43:59] my life today
[44:00] yes i've been filled but lord i need a
[44:02] re-refilling this must be a daily
[44:04] occurrence
[44:05] a daily seeking seeking to where we
[44:08] esteem
[44:09] his favor higher than anything else that
[44:11] we're seeking in our lives
[44:13] we must esteem his favor higher than
[44:15] earthly possessions and earthly goods
[44:17] and earthly things that we would try to
[44:18] attain to in our lives
[44:20] it cannot be that it just becomes so
[44:22] common to us to where we just expect it
[44:25] to be so we just expect god's favor
[44:29] we just expect it because i'm called he
[44:32] chose me
[44:33] so i expect that favor i can't get to
[44:35] that point of well i believe god sent a
[44:37] prophet
[44:38] i live a clean life i profess this
[44:41] message
[44:42] so i know i'm all right i live a good
[44:45] life i've been called to be the bride
[44:47] i'm going in a rapture that's what the
[44:49] message told me god called me and he
[44:51] chose me so
[44:52] now i'm just going to go through life
[44:54] now i'm just going to progress through
[44:56] life
[44:56] and what happens is that that place you
[44:59] accepted his favor ends up being way
[45:01] back there somewhere
[45:02] it begins to be a million miles away
[45:04] from you and you're not continually
[45:06] walking in his favor
[45:07] daily you're not walking and seeking
[45:10] what he has for you
[45:11] daily so you go after life and you sure
[45:14] i'm saved yeah i accept the message
[45:16] and now i'm chasing after my career
[45:19] now i'm chasing after earthly
[45:20] accomplishments now yeah i come to
[45:22] church almost all the time i'm there
[45:24] almost every service but where is the
[45:26] seeking
[45:28] where is the persevering where is the
[45:30] pushing through
[45:31] where is the the crying out to god god i
[45:34] need more of you my family needs more of
[45:36] you
[45:36] listen i know maybe my life is the only
[45:40] one that's not perfect
[45:41] but i know there's probably enough
[45:42] problems in that house tonight that
[45:44] there ought to be a crying out there
[45:46] ought to be a pushing through there
[45:47] ought to be a sincerity of god i need
[45:49] you to move in my life
[45:50] god i need you tomorrow thank you for
[45:52] bringing us through 2020.
[45:54] thank you for what you did in 2020 but i
[45:56] need you tonight and i need you in the
[45:57] morning i'm gonna need you the next day
[45:59] god i'm asking you to give me your favor
[46:02] again
[46:02] right now
[46:06] where is the sincerity to know him more
[46:09] where is the sincerity to please him
[46:11] better
[46:12] what is your will lord for this
[46:14] situation lord what is your will lord in
[46:16] my life not ho-hum will
[46:18] god bless i believe the message i'm
[46:21] predestinated so i know that it's all
[46:23] just going to work itself out because i
[46:24] believe in predestination
[46:26] see what you that's the language of
[46:28] someone who has begun to take the favor
[46:30] of god
[46:31] for granted that is someone who it has
[46:33] become
[46:34] common to that is someone who doesn't
[46:36] recognize what a treasure it is
[46:39] you're not holding on to it tight enough
[46:41] you're not seeking after it hard enough
[46:43] you're not desperate enough for you and
[46:45] so the scripture cries out
[46:46] and he says hold fast at what you have
[46:49] hold on to it
[46:50] let another man come and take your crown
[46:53] hold fast
[46:54] something that you cherish it's
[46:55] something that you long for it's
[46:56] something that you have to have
[46:58] his favor is to be honored his favor is
[47:02] to be sought after more than any earthly
[47:04] possession because without his favor
[47:06] you and i are nothing
[47:09] without his favor we are not on speaking
[47:12] terms
[47:13] with him when you're not in his favor
[47:16] you don't have the ability to come
[47:18] directly to his throne
[47:19] and speak to him for the need that
[47:22] presently is facing you in your life
[47:24] we must get to the place where there is
[47:26] nothing
[47:27] i want more than god's favor there is
[47:30] nothing i want more today than god's
[47:32] favor in my life there's nothing i want
[47:33] more than to please him but what if it
[47:35] don't please your family
[47:36] what if it don't please your work what
[47:38] if it don't please there's nothing i
[47:40] want more
[47:40] than to please almighty god in 2021
[47:43] there's nothing i want more than to take
[47:45] another step closer to him in the coming
[47:47] year
[47:47] there's nothing i want more than for him
[47:50] to mold me into what he wants me to be
[47:52] and not what i want to be
[47:57] and there's no doubt that we can look
[47:59] around just every day every one of us
[48:01] regardless of the place you find
[48:02] yourself tonight
[48:03] you can look around and you can see his
[48:05] favor in your life
[48:07] he chose us he called us he gave us
[48:10] unmerited grace he gave us
[48:12] unmerited favor we are blessed tonight
[48:15] beyond all measure
[48:17] and even though it is freely given and
[48:19] even though it is already ours god wants
[48:21] us to continually seek after it with our
[48:24] whole heart
[48:25] he wants us to seek him with her whole
[48:27] heart and that's when we find him
[48:28] that's when we grow closer to him that's
[48:30] when we progress in god
[48:32] this isn't just for the initial seeking
[48:34] of salvation or just for someone seeking
[48:36] a healing or someone just seeking after
[48:38] the baptism of the holy ghost
[48:40] although that would apply but this would
[48:42] be monday through whatever day
[48:43] this would be every day of the week
[48:45] every day of the month every day of the
[48:46] coming year that you seek after god with
[48:49] your whole heart
[48:50] every day continually god i have to have
[48:53] you
[48:53] lord i want to please you show me where
[48:56] i've been wrong lord
[48:57] lord i'm willing to repent know what i'm
[48:58] willing to say i'm wrong
[49:00] that's one of the hardest things for
[49:02] people to do say they're wrong but we're
[49:03] in the age of laodicea where the zeal of
[49:05] the hour is to repent
[49:07] if you see where you're wrong it's too
[49:09] late to play games it's too late for
[49:10] pride it's too late to say that's the
[49:12] way i am
[49:13] it's too late the rapture is right
[49:16] around the corner the coming of the lord
[49:17] is almost upon us we're turning the
[49:19] calendar once again
[49:20] how many more times will we turn it it's
[49:23] too late
[49:23] repent where you fall short each and
[49:26] every one of us have to repent and say
[49:27] god in the coming year may i be more
[49:29] like you
[49:30] i need your favor lord in my life
[49:37] we see in the first book of esther
[49:41] the king of hazarus is having a great
[49:43] feast
[49:45] and it goes through in the first few
[49:47] verses and it describes how for many
[49:48] days he showed the glory of his kingdom
[49:52] it was a mighty banquet and it was
[49:54] lavish with gold and silver utensils and
[49:57] cups and plates and forks and everything
[49:58] i guess you would have or need at a
[50:00] banquet
[50:01] fine linens were brought out tables and
[50:03] pillars of marble
[50:06] the most expensive probably the most
[50:07] amazing most wonderful kingdom on the
[50:09] earth at that time and he was showing
[50:11] off his kingdom
[50:12] he was having people come in and he was
[50:14] showing that basically that's the way
[50:16] he was showing off look what i have
[50:19] look how wonderful my kingdom is look at
[50:21] all the riches look at all the splendor
[50:23] look at all this
[50:24] and yet towards the end he wants to show
[50:27] off
[50:27] what he considers to be the real beauty
[50:29] of his kingdom
[50:31] he wants to show off what his real pride
[50:33] and joy is
[50:35] he wants to show off what he is more
[50:36] proud of than any utensil of any pillar
[50:39] any marble any material possession
[50:41] and it's his wife it's queen vashti
[50:46] and he wants to show her off and we're
[50:48] going to look in esther 1 and verse 9
[50:50] and it says also vashti the queen made a
[50:53] feast for the women
[50:54] in the royal house which belonged to
[50:56] king a hazaris
[50:58] on the seventh day when the heart of the
[51:00] king was married with wine he commanded
[51:02] mahuman
[51:03] vista harbona biktha and abagtha
[51:07] zitha carcass and seven chamberlains
[51:09] that served in the presence of a
[51:10] hazardous the king
[51:12] to bring vasht to the queen before the
[51:14] king with the crown royal
[51:16] to show the people and the princes her
[51:19] beauty
[51:20] that this wasn't to make a show this
[51:22] wasn't punishment he was proud of her
[51:25] he was proud of her and he bring he
[51:27] brings her in
[51:28] to show the the princes her beauty for
[51:31] she was fair to look on
[51:33] verse 12. but the queen vashti refused
[51:37] to come at the king's commandment by his
[51:39] chamberlains
[51:40] therefore was the king very roth
[51:44] and his anger burned in him this is his
[51:48] queen this is the love of his life
[51:52] this is the one he wants nothing more
[51:54] than bestow honor upon
[51:56] he wants to bestow great honors upon her
[51:59] he wants people to recognize this is one
[52:01] that i love more than any other
[52:03] this is one who had found favor in the
[52:06] eyes of the king
[52:09] she has to know how furious this is
[52:10] going to make him
[52:12] she has to know this does not please the
[52:15] king
[52:16] she has to know and yet before we throw
[52:19] pitchforks how many times do we do
[52:21] things that we have to know would not be
[52:23] pleasing to god
[52:25] maybe it's not sinful maybe it's not
[52:28] something that's going to send you to
[52:29] hell but the question is is this
[52:31] pleasing to the king
[52:33] is this something he would want me to do
[52:35] is this something he would take glory
[52:37] and is this something that he would
[52:38] probably
[52:39] point to you and go this is my queen
[52:41] this is my wife
[52:42] look at the way she conducts herself
[52:44] look at the way she operates
[52:47] he has she has to know this is going to
[52:49] anger him she has to know this is going
[52:51] to displease him
[52:52] he only wants to show her beauty he's so
[52:55] proud of her he wants to honor her
[52:56] but she has now taken her position for
[52:59] granted
[53:01] she knows she has the king's favor
[53:05] he chose me he called
[53:08] me he put me in a position
[53:12] of authority well brother aaron i know
[53:15] he called me
[53:16] i know he chose me i know he loves me
[53:18] well that's an awesome place to be in
[53:20] you're exactly where bastia was
[53:23] called chosen favored
[53:28] exactly where she was sitting it's who
[53:30] she was she was chosen look it's not
[53:31] like
[53:32] she made herself queen it's not like she
[53:34] said i'm gonna be the queen of persia
[53:35] okay deal there you go
[53:37] no of all the women in the entire world
[53:40] the king had chosen her
[53:42] she was a chosen people she was a
[53:45] chosen person listen the methodist
[53:49] the baptist the pentecostals they've all
[53:52] sat in vashti's seat
[53:55] they've all said in that exact same spot
[53:57] they were favored
[53:58] they heard the message of the hour they
[54:00] were called
[54:01] and yet there came a time for them to go
[54:03] to his banquet
[54:05] there came a time for them to progress
[54:07] and for him to pour out more of himself
[54:09] upon them
[54:10] for him to give them more revelation for
[54:12] him to say this is my bride i'm proud of
[54:14] her
[54:15] and yet they refused to come they
[54:18] refused to come
[54:19] there was a further revealing of the
[54:21] word that was to happen
[54:23] a time where god wanted to honor his
[54:24] people pour himself
[54:26] out more than ever before it was the
[54:28] hour for further revealing
[54:31] and he called for them but they wouldn't
[54:34] move
[54:35] because they had become comfortable
[54:38] where they were
[54:39] they had become confident in their
[54:41] position we're called
[54:43] we're chosen and we're favored those
[54:46] people were called
[54:47] out we like to say we're we're called
[54:50] out we've been called but at one point
[54:51] they were called
[54:52] out at one point they were the chosen
[54:55] but something hindered them
[54:56] something stopped them somewhere along
[54:59] the way they quit
[55:00] seeking his favor somewhere along the
[55:02] way his word didn't matter and what
[55:04] their word said mattered
[55:06] somewhere along the way pleasing him
[55:07] wasn't as important as having a big
[55:09] church in a big congregation
[55:11] somewhere along the way they quit
[55:14] seeking after his favor
[55:16] there came a point where seeking his
[55:18] will and seeking his favor is no longer
[55:20] a priority
[55:21] because they were taking it for granted
[55:23] we are the church
[55:25] we're the ones that god's blessing has
[55:26] been poured out upon
[55:29] and so vashti is no longer interested in
[55:31] seeking his favor
[55:32] because she's content right where she's
[55:35] at
[55:37] she's developed a sense of importance
[55:39] god help us never to get that place
[55:41] where we get some sense of arrogance or
[55:42] pride because
[55:43] we're the bride and god called us you're
[55:45] not the first ones to be called
[55:48] you're not the first ones to be called
[55:50] out you're not the first ones to receive
[55:51] a message
[55:52] and if you don't take this message and
[55:53] take a rapture you're no different than
[55:55] the ones called before you
[55:57] if it doesn't rapture you what
[55:58] difference is there between you and the
[56:00] ones called before you
[56:02] if you don't finish the race what
[56:03] difference is there
[56:05] so don't get yourself puffed up but
[56:07] recognize if i'm anything it's because
[56:09] he called me
[56:10] if i'm anything it's because of his
[56:12] grace if i'm anything it's because of
[56:14] his favor and if i ever want to be
[56:15] anything i'm going to have to stay
[56:17] in that favor i'm going to seek his
[56:20] favor each and every day
[56:23] she develops a sense of importance i'm
[56:25] the queen
[56:26] i was chosen he showed me favor
[56:30] and it begins to cause her to value her
[56:32] own thinking and ideas as if they have
[56:33] some type of importance
[56:36] just like many today my ideas my way
[56:39] i'll accept it when i want to my way my
[56:41] time when i want
[56:42] but it's not your way it's not when you
[56:45] want we forget
[56:46] god has a way he has a provided way and
[56:49] god has a will
[56:50] and if we're to be his bride if we're to
[56:52] be his queen
[56:53] then his will must be our will his way
[56:56] must be our way
[56:57] what he chooses must be what we delight
[56:59] in we must seek after him at all times
[57:01] it's not our way our thinking that's
[57:03] what gets you one left behind that's
[57:05] what gets the crown taken from you
[57:08] that's why it says hold fast that what
[57:09] you have cherish it
[57:11] cherish it seek after it hold on to it
[57:14] like you've never held onto anything
[57:15] before
[57:19] because we can't be lukewarm about his
[57:20] word and then expect to gain his favor
[57:22] when we come before him
[57:25] he's calling you to a banquet
[57:28] and he's saying i want to give you more
[57:31] i want to feel you
[57:32] more i want you to experience more
[57:35] i want to show you even more than what
[57:37] i've already done i want to favor you
[57:39] even more than what i've already done
[57:41] look he's calling to give you more in
[57:43] 2021.
[57:44] he's wanting to fill you more in 2021
[57:46] he's calling evening like tabernacle to
[57:48] moore
[57:49] in the year 2021 can you respond or are
[57:53] you too busy
[57:56] will you hear the call where you answer
[57:58] the call
[57:59] do you have time for it are you in the
[58:01] middle of something you have going on
[58:05] look we spend way too much time seeking
[58:07] favor in other places
[58:09] seeking favor from different people
[58:11] seeking favor from our family or seeking
[58:13] favor from friends or seeking favor from
[58:15] bosses
[58:16] and yet the whole time god's sitting
[58:17] there trying to give you his favor
[58:19] trying to call you to his banquet trying
[58:20] to pour out a blessing upon your life
[58:22] saying i want to give you more i want to
[58:24] give you more and yet we don't value it
[58:26] there's no value to it we look at the
[58:29] other things and so we can lay out a
[58:30] church here and we can do that there
[58:32] because we place more value on it
[58:34] listen the rich young ruler found favor
[58:36] with god it actually says jesus loved
[58:38] him
[58:40] and he offers it to him he gives it to
[58:42] him and yet when he weighs it out he
[58:44] doesn't value the favor of god
[58:46] near as much as he values earthly
[58:48] possessions
[58:49] he doesn't put enough value on it so he
[58:51] turns and he walks away
[58:53] and when we have opportunity to be in
[58:55] the house of god or we have opportunity
[58:57] and god calls
[58:58] us to do something for him how are we
[59:00] any better when we don't make time for
[59:02] it because you will make time for your
[59:04] priorities period
[59:07] you always will he's calling you to his
[59:11] banquet
[59:12] and he wants you to value that
[59:14] opportunity
[59:15] he wants you to value what is being
[59:18] offered to you tonight
[59:20] even though he wants you to value it so
[59:23] much that no matter what other
[59:25] opportunities you have
[59:27] no matter what is laid at your feet you
[59:29] can turn from those things and say
[59:31] i choose his favor i choose his favor in
[59:34] 2021
[59:35] you must seek him first brother branham
[59:39] would say
[59:40] not what men say not what the church
[59:42] said but what god's will was
[59:44] oh we need to seek the will of god not
[59:46] the favor of your neighbor
[59:47] not the favor of your children not the
[59:49] favor of your husband or your wife
[59:52] but seek the will of god and do that
[59:54] first
[59:55] then everything else the will of the
[59:57] wife and the will of the children will
[59:58] fall right in
[1:00:00] with it but put god
[1:00:03] first so as we sit here and look ahead i
[1:00:07] ask you what are you seeking in 2021
[1:00:11] what are you gaining or giving up
[1:00:15] when you choose to pursue your desires
[1:00:18] even when those desires
[1:00:20] conflict with your walk as a christian
[1:00:23] when they conflict with obeying the word
[1:00:26] vashti when they conflict regularly with
[1:00:31] being in the house of god
[1:00:33] vashti listen vashti's sin was not
[1:00:37] having a banquet
[1:00:40] there was there was no sin in that the
[1:00:42] sin isn't making plans the sin isn't
[1:00:44] having ambitions a sin isn't going to
[1:00:46] college the sin isn't doing something
[1:00:47] you like or having a career
[1:00:50] there's there's no sin in that the sin
[1:00:52] is placing her will
[1:00:54] over his will all right the sin is
[1:00:57] placing her desires over his desires
[1:00:59] the sin is when he called she didn't
[1:01:01] drop everything in answer because he was
[1:01:03] her king
[1:01:04] he was her husband and he had chosen her
[1:01:08] the sin isn't pursuing things in this
[1:01:09] world the sin is pursuing those when it
[1:01:11] takes away from your opportunity
[1:01:13] to be in god's favor she placed him
[1:01:17] second and showed his favor was not a
[1:01:20] priority to her
[1:01:23] hello church attendance
[1:01:27] hello prayer life
[1:01:30] hello devotions
[1:01:33] you will make time for what is important
[1:01:36] to you
[1:01:37] you will make time for your priorities
[1:01:41] i just couldn't make it that's because
[1:01:43] you didn't make it a priority
[1:01:50] god wants you available to do his will
[1:01:55] listen down through the ages he has
[1:01:56] shown his power in every age
[1:01:58] down through the church ages he's shown
[1:02:00] his power and it's been majestic it's
[1:02:02] been wonderful
[1:02:03] an awesome banquet as it were but now
[1:02:06] towards the end he wants to show off his
[1:02:08] queen
[1:02:10] he wants to let everyone look upon
[1:02:13] her beauty upon what his grace has done
[1:02:16] for her
[1:02:17] he wants people to see her and all her
[1:02:20] glory
[1:02:21] and all her beauty and yet he's finding
[1:02:24] people too busy to come
[1:02:27] too busy to come to the feasts
[1:02:31] i'll tell what about a banquet of
[1:02:32] worship that he calls us to every time
[1:02:34] we gather together on sunday and
[1:02:36] wednesday
[1:02:37] what about that when we're gathered to a
[1:02:39] banquet of worship and he comes by
[1:02:40] expecting a fresh drink of water
[1:02:42] listen he can't get another place he
[1:02:44] can't get it at the denominational
[1:02:45] churches he can't get it
[1:02:46] in all these places it has wiggle tails
[1:02:48] in it so he's here to get a fresh drink
[1:02:50] of worship and so he shows up at our
[1:02:51] church and he begins to move through our
[1:02:53] congregation
[1:02:54] longing to find that fresh drink here
[1:02:57] longing to find somebody who will praise
[1:02:59] him in spirit and in truth longing to
[1:03:01] find somebody that'll give him
[1:03:02] everything longing to find somebody that
[1:03:03] don't care
[1:03:04] what those around them think longing to
[1:03:06] find somebody that'll worship with their
[1:03:08] whole heart because they love him so
[1:03:09] much for what he's done in their life
[1:03:11] because he's saved them and he's healed
[1:03:13] them he's delivering them and he's given
[1:03:14] his life he's looking for somebody
[1:03:15] that'll worship him
[1:03:17] with their whole heart with their heart
[1:03:19] with their soul with their mind with
[1:03:20] everything and he comes by and he moves
[1:03:24] here and he calls you to his banquet of
[1:03:25] worship and says pour out your praise
[1:03:28] give me all you've got and i'll pour my
[1:03:31] favor out upon you
[1:03:32] i'll pour out my spirit upon you i'll
[1:03:34] bestow gifts upon you i'll show everyone
[1:03:36] here that i love you
[1:03:37] as i move down upon you as you worship
[1:03:40] me
[1:03:40] but you can't enter into the banquet of
[1:03:42] worship because you're too busy at your
[1:03:43] own self-styled banquet well that's just
[1:03:45] not my nature
[1:03:48] and you're stuck at the banquet of not
[1:03:49] my nature and you're missing out on the
[1:03:51] blessings he wants to give you
[1:03:52] you're missing out on everything you
[1:03:53] want to do because why is it not your
[1:03:55] nature to accept what god wants to put
[1:03:57] on you
[1:03:58] somebody explained that to me why is it
[1:04:01] not your nature to turn down the gifts
[1:04:03] that god put in
[1:04:04] his word how is that not your nature
[1:04:13] look i'm not trying to get us all to
[1:04:15] worship the same
[1:04:18] just worship the king of kings moves
[1:04:21] through the building the king of kings
[1:04:22] the one that died for you remember
[1:04:26] he moves through the building and yeah
[1:04:30] nothing hey you don't i'm not asking you
[1:04:34] to yell and scream but how hard is it to
[1:04:35] say i love you lord
[1:04:39] how hard is it to sing along
[1:04:42] well i don't like that song he probably
[1:04:44] didn't like nails in his hands and feet
[1:04:46] but he did it for you
[1:04:51] i'll sing the next song
[1:04:54] he doesn't pass you by
[1:05:00] you choose not to enter in and just like
[1:05:03] vashti
[1:05:04] you know it's unpleasing to him well
[1:05:06] brother aaron how should i
[1:05:08] worship however the holy spirit moves
[1:05:11] you
[1:05:11] to quit being a spiritual fire
[1:05:15] extinguisher
[1:05:16] quit trying to put the brakes on
[1:05:17] everything and and little spark breaks
[1:05:19] out your
[1:05:23] they almost shouted on my pew
[1:05:26] would have woke my kids up
[1:05:34] how should i worship brother brown gives
[1:05:37] a good
[1:05:37] explanation you don't care what the
[1:05:40] neighbor's going to say
[1:05:41] you don't care if you shout you speak
[1:05:43] with tongues or whatever you do
[1:05:45] it's past that you took god at his word
[1:05:49] you don't care for criticism you lost
[1:05:50] all your devil made homemade
[1:05:52] intellectual society called prestige
[1:05:54] the thing that you want is favor with
[1:05:57] god
[1:05:58] you don't care what the holy spirit
[1:06:00] causes you to do
[1:06:02] shout scream cry ball or anything you
[1:06:04] want to do
[1:06:05] anything the spirit puts on you you do
[1:06:08] it because you just
[1:06:10] don't care
[1:06:13] don't care
[1:06:17] i'm not picking on brother joe but i
[1:06:18] don't know if you've ever known us he
[1:06:19] don't care
[1:06:20] he don't care i don't care
[1:06:24] and you shouldn't care what i think you
[1:06:27] shouldn't
[1:06:29] if the holy spirit moves upon you just
[1:06:31] worship
[1:06:32] just let go just give him a fresh drink
[1:06:34] just say lord all i want is your favor
[1:06:37] i don't care if everybody else here
[1:06:38] thinks i'm crazy listen we're all crazy
[1:06:43] i mean just ask people out there
[1:06:46] you think you're going to get some
[1:06:48] greater press d just because you didn't
[1:06:49] run around the church in a church full
[1:06:51] of people that run around the church
[1:06:55] that's it you are what you are
[1:06:58] you might as well join us you might as
[1:07:01] well come and have a good time you might
[1:07:03] as well come and let loose you might as
[1:07:04] well come and praise the king of kings
[1:07:06] because i'm telling you he deserves it
[1:07:08] he deserves your praise
[1:07:09] he deserves your worship he deserves
[1:07:12] everything that you could possibly give
[1:07:14] him
[1:07:21] brother aaron i have his favor yes you
[1:07:23] do
[1:07:25] and so did vashti for a time so did
[1:07:26] luther's move for a time so did wesley's
[1:07:29] move for a time so did pentecost
[1:07:31] but she became so used to being queen
[1:07:33] she forgot what made her royalty
[1:07:36] was the unmerited grace and favor of the
[1:07:38] king
[1:07:40] she lost the sense of wonder and
[1:07:43] amazement that being
[1:07:45] in the king's presence used to bring
[1:07:48] church we are blessed beyond measure
[1:07:50] with the services that we have in the
[1:07:51] moving of the spirit do
[1:07:53] not lose your amazement and your wonder
[1:07:56] when the spirit of god moves through the
[1:07:58] place
[1:07:58] don't let it become common to you don't
[1:08:01] let it be oh she's shouting again
[1:08:05] don't let it get to that point to where
[1:08:07] we get called to the banquet and we just
[1:08:09] don't go because
[1:08:10] we had a banquet like this wednesday
[1:08:14] we had a banquet just like this on
[1:08:16] sunday
[1:08:18] i'd like to have one every time we come
[1:08:20] to church if god chooses to move that
[1:08:22] way
[1:08:23] i'm there i want to be a part of it but
[1:08:26] it becomes so common to us
[1:08:29] so now the royal crown and all that goes
[1:08:31] with it is to be placed
[1:08:33] on another one who would give him his
[1:08:35] proper place
[1:08:36] one who would always desire and seek his
[1:08:39] favor
[1:08:41] brother branham says i'm poor that's
[1:08:43] true god knows that's true
[1:08:45] that's right if i took the money been
[1:08:47] offered to me i'd been a
[1:08:48] multi-millionaire
[1:08:50] but i'd rather be poor and have favor
[1:08:52] with god
[1:08:53] than the best home you got in toledo
[1:08:55] that's right
[1:08:56] i'd rather have it because this is my
[1:08:59] work
[1:09:00] to serve god that's what's
[1:09:03] in my heart
[1:09:07] what's in our heart tonight what favor
[1:09:11] are we seeking brother aaron this is a
[1:09:15] little bit different from the way you
[1:09:16] usually preach why are you being so hard
[1:09:19] because there's haman's in the land
[1:09:22] there's haman's in the land and their
[1:09:24] one desire is to wipe out the royal seat
[1:09:26] of abraham
[1:09:27] to come and to destroy you to come and
[1:09:29] to wipe you off and there must be
[1:09:30] somebody seeking favor with the king
[1:09:32] there must be somebody seeking entrance
[1:09:34] into the king's presence
[1:09:36] there must be somebody who is on
[1:09:37] speaking terms with the king that'll be
[1:09:39] willing to stand up and expose the enemy
[1:09:41] before the enemy destroys you
[1:09:43] haman's in the land and he wants to
[1:09:45] destroy you and somebody
[1:09:46] is favored to speak in this last day
[1:09:49] listen the denominations can't do it
[1:09:52] they've already been stripped of their
[1:09:53] right to speak the denominations can't
[1:09:55] do it well then brother aaron who can go
[1:09:57] into the king
[1:09:58] who's going to do it you are
[1:10:01] you're gonna do it you're gonna be the

[1:11:22] present
[1:11:22] help in the time of trouble
[1:11:28] vashti didn't think she had to find the
[1:11:30] king's will
[1:11:31] or find the king's favor she didn't
[1:11:33] think she had to obey
[1:11:35] certain parts of the word esther 119
[1:11:41] if it pleased the king let there go a
[1:11:43] royal commandment from him and let it be
[1:11:45] written among the laws of the persians
[1:11:47] and the medes
[1:11:48] that it not be altered that vashti come
[1:11:51] no more before king a hazarus and let
[1:11:54] the king give her royal estate unto
[1:11:56] another
[1:11:57] that is better than she what you see
[1:12:00] here is a casting out
[1:12:03] a spewing out as it were there in the
[1:12:05] book of revelation
[1:12:07] she has lost the right to come before
[1:12:09] the king
[1:12:10] she has lost her position of favor
[1:12:13] therefore she has lost her right to
[1:12:15] speak
[1:12:16] with the authority of the king she is no
[1:12:19] longer
[1:12:20] on speaking terms just like we see this
[1:12:23] stripped away from the latest in church
[1:12:25] in revelation 3 16
[1:12:27] they will not speak for him anymore they
[1:12:30] have lost their right to come before the
[1:12:32] king and to speak with his name and use
[1:12:34] his authority
[1:12:35] they will come no more before the king
[1:12:37] and sure this speaks of the church
[1:12:39] and then their position and their
[1:12:40] authority and what god has done with
[1:12:42] them
[1:12:43] when they quit seeking his favor when
[1:12:45] they became lukewarm
[1:12:46] they would no longer be his mouthpiece
[1:12:49] and that does speak of the church but
[1:12:51] what about you tonight
[1:12:52] what about your ability to speak what
[1:12:55] about your position as an individual to
[1:12:57] stand
[1:12:58] and speak and your words have authority
[1:13:00] your words have life
[1:13:02] your words have mountain moving power
[1:13:04] what about your ability to speak
[1:13:06] what about this bride in this day that
[1:13:08] has put his favor
[1:13:09] above all else listen it wasn't just
[1:13:12] vastly losing a position there was
[1:13:14] somebody else rising to a position
[1:13:16] it wasn't her just being stripped of
[1:13:18] authority but someone else was having
[1:13:20] that authority
[1:13:21] bestowed upon their lives there was
[1:13:24] another one who found favor
[1:13:27] it's not just that the church lost
[1:13:29] authority
[1:13:30] but the bride has gained that authority
[1:13:33] to speak
[1:13:36] vashti is cast out and loses her
[1:13:38] position and the call goes out into the
[1:13:40] land to find a bride for the king
[1:13:44] so all the young virgins in the kingdom
[1:13:45] were gathered to the palace at shushan
[1:13:49] and we look now at esther 2 and 15.
[1:13:55] now when the turn of esther the daughter
[1:13:56] of abigail the uncle of mordecai
[1:13:59] who had taken her for his daughter was
[1:14:00] come to go in unto the king
[1:14:02] she required nothing but what hagiai the
[1:14:04] king's chamberlain
[1:14:06] the keeper of women appointed and esther
[1:14:08] obtained
[1:14:09] favor in the sight of all them that
[1:14:11] looked upon her
[1:14:13] so esther was taken unto king of hazarus
[1:14:15] into his house royal
[1:14:17] in the tenth month which is the month
[1:14:19] tebbeth in the seventh year of his reign
[1:14:21] and the king loved esther above all the
[1:14:24] women
[1:14:25] notice he loves her
[1:14:28] she obtains grace and favor in his sight
[1:14:32] more than all the virgins so she already
[1:14:34] knows
[1:14:35] she's favored so that he sets the royal
[1:14:39] crown upon her head
[1:14:41] and made her queen instead of vashti
[1:14:44] notice she finds favor from everyone
[1:14:46] everyone that looks upon her favors her
[1:14:49] the king loves her the king chooses her
[1:14:51] she attains grace
[1:14:52] and favor in the sight of the king the
[1:14:54] royal crown is set up on her head so at
[1:14:56] this point
[1:14:57] she is sitting exactly where vashti said
[1:15:00] she has progressed no further or
[1:15:01] achieved anything nothing greater than
[1:15:03] what vashti has achieved
[1:15:05] vasti had once been favored she has once
[1:15:08] had the authority to speak
[1:15:09] but the difference is esther knows there
[1:15:11] is nothing that she has done that has
[1:15:13] made her royalty
[1:15:15] she knows that the only reason she's
[1:15:17] there is the unmerited grace and the
[1:15:19] unmerited favor of the king
[1:15:21] and that it's the king that has chose
[1:15:23] her to sit there
[1:15:25] it's his will that makes her the queen
[1:15:29] and so she has this understanding that
[1:15:31] she must continually seek
[1:15:34] his favor if we continue on in the book
[1:15:37] of esther
[1:15:39] haman comes on the scene 12 years into
[1:15:42] the reign of king
[1:15:42] hazarus which would mean that we first
[1:15:45] encounter him in the scripture
[1:15:47] five years into their marriage or five
[1:15:50] years into esther being queen
[1:15:53] because she and uh was chosen by king of
[1:15:55] hazardous in the seventh year of his
[1:15:57] reign
[1:15:58] so if you'll notice before haman shows
[1:16:01] up there has been a
[1:16:02] time period that has passed since her
[1:16:04] choosing
[1:16:06] a period of time has passed that she was
[1:16:08] called by a message that was sent out to
[1:16:10] find a bride for the king
[1:16:13] and although she has remained mostly in
[1:16:15] the background
[1:16:17] although she has remained mostly in the
[1:16:19] shadows
[1:16:20] the time is fast approaching now for her
[1:16:23] to speak
[1:16:24] the time is fast approaching for her to
[1:16:26] rise to the occasion
[1:16:29] and whether you realize it or not the
[1:16:31] time for you to speak
[1:16:32] is fast approaching upon us you may have
[1:16:35] been in the shadows you may have been in
[1:16:36] the
[1:16:37] background not out in the forefront but
[1:16:39] the time is fast approaching
[1:16:40] that the bride must come to the
[1:16:42] forefront and once again
[1:16:43] speak using the authority that has been
[1:16:45] granted her by her position
[1:16:47] the time for you to take your position
[1:16:50] and take the word and speak
[1:16:51] life to your situation is here
[1:16:55] it's no longer something we can put off
[1:16:57] till tomorrow it's no longer we can say
[1:16:59] one day one day one day that day has
[1:17:01] arrived
[1:17:02] the time for john 14 12 is now
[1:17:05] the time for you to speak to your
[1:17:07] mountain is now
[1:17:09] the time is right now that's why listen
[1:17:11] you say but it's such a dark time
[1:17:13] you mean right now look that's the very
[1:17:15] reason esther was even there
[1:17:17] was because of the dark time for such a
[1:17:20] time as this that's why
[1:17:22] she was there and that's why you're here
[1:17:24] in this time
[1:17:25] the worst time so that manifested sons
[1:17:28] and daughters
[1:17:29] could rise to the occasion and speak to
[1:17:31] the mountain in the mouth that will have
[1:17:33] to be cast into the sea
[1:17:34] where they can speak to sickness and
[1:17:36] they'll be healing where they can speak
[1:17:38] to those that are bound and they'll be
[1:17:39] deliverance
[1:17:40] so they can speak under the anointing of
[1:17:42] the holy spirit and in that moment
[1:17:44] find the right words to find favor and
[1:17:45] bring salvation to a lost loved one
[1:17:48] that's why we're here in this time it's
[1:17:50] to be manifested in the position that he
[1:17:52] called us to
[1:17:54] where you'll speak to mountains and
[1:17:55] they'll move
[1:17:59] but we have to stay on speaking terms
[1:18:04] because our time to speak is upon us
[1:18:08] sure 2020 seemed dark
[1:18:12] but what about the year esther faced in
[1:18:14] 474 bc you know anything about that
[1:18:18] that was a dark year 474
[1:18:22] bc is when haman begins to try to
[1:18:25] exterminate
[1:18:26] an entire race of people
[1:18:29] wicked haman has come to power in the
[1:18:32] world that they live in
[1:18:33] 474 bc
[1:18:37] stop for just a moment moment and go
[1:18:39] here
[1:18:41] before we move on to 2021 there's still
[1:18:44] time
[1:18:46] deal with your 2020 devils
[1:18:52] before we go into the next year deal
[1:18:54] with the devils that have been
[1:18:55] tormenting you and holding you and
[1:18:57] bothering you right now
[1:18:59] don't carry them with you another minute
[1:19:01] don't carry them with you another night
[1:19:02] don't carry them with you into another
[1:19:04] year
[1:19:05] look don't procrastinate don't hesitate
[1:19:07] to do all that the word has told you to
[1:19:09] do
[1:19:10] do not show any leniency to a devil that
[1:19:13] has tormented you
[1:19:14] or tormented your family if you need to
[1:19:17] deal with it deal with it tonight
[1:19:19] like because if you don't deal with it
[1:19:21] tonight and if you let it carry on and
[1:19:22] you procrastinate you're going to wake
[1:19:24] up in 2021
[1:19:25] with the same devil of torment that's
[1:19:27] been there all along you can turn over
[1:19:29] all the new leaps you want to turn over
[1:19:31] and every time you turn over there's
[1:19:32] going to be a devil going boop
[1:19:33] all right you got to deal with it right
[1:19:36] now quit putting it off i will i will
[1:19:38] this is just who i am it's not who you
[1:19:40] are
[1:19:41] all right that temper is not who you are
[1:19:43] that complex is not who you are
[1:19:45] if we would hold to god's promises as
[1:19:46] tight as we hold on to our complexes
[1:19:48] and hold onto those promises as tight as
[1:19:50] we hold on to family traits
[1:19:52] we would be getting somewhere tonight
[1:19:53] let loose of those things and grab a
[1:19:55] hold of god's promise
[1:19:56] and say in 2021 things will be different
[1:19:59] not because i'm making a new year's
[1:20:01] resolution but because i'm committing it
[1:20:03] to almighty god
[1:20:04] tonight i'm putting it into his hands
[1:20:07] right now
[1:20:08] [Applause]
[1:20:11] if temper has hindered you deal with it
[1:20:14] if lust has hindered you deal with it
[1:20:17] if bitterness is eating you up deal with
[1:20:19] it
[1:20:21] if unforgiveness is in your heart deal
[1:20:23] with it
[1:20:24] if you have a critical spirit deal with
[1:20:27] it
[1:20:28] you know brother brown said it is not
[1:20:29] possible to have favor with god and have
[1:20:31] a critical spirit
[1:20:33] it's not possible to have favor with god
[1:20:36] and have a critical spirit
[1:20:38] deal with things now why are you saying
[1:20:41] this brother aaron
[1:20:43] look in esther three and one
[1:20:46] after these things did king a hazarus
[1:20:48] promote haman
[1:20:50] the son of hamaditha the agagite
[1:20:55] and advanced him and set his seat above
[1:20:57] all the princes that were with him
[1:21:00] haman the agagite
[1:21:04] okay big deal what are you trying to say
[1:21:07] haman is a direct descendant
[1:21:09] of the amalekites that saul
[1:21:12] was told to completely destroy
[1:21:16] and even carries the name of their king
[1:21:18] ag
[1:21:19] so he is known as an a-gagite
[1:21:22] jewish writings say that the leniency
[1:21:25] shown by saul to king agag actually made
[1:21:28] it possible for haman to appear
[1:21:30] because had he been killed one day
[1:21:32] sooner
[1:21:34] or the day that he was supposed to be
[1:21:36] killed the great peril which the jews
[1:21:38] had to undergo at the hands of haman
[1:21:40] would have been completely averted
[1:21:43] because
[1:21:44] it was in that time that agag's lineage
[1:21:47] was able to continue and led directly
[1:21:50] to haman just by saul's procrastination
[1:21:55] samuel shows up and says he hewed him to
[1:21:57] pieces but he was a day late
[1:21:59] because saul didn't do what he was
[1:22:01] called to do
[1:22:03] you keep letting that little thing
[1:22:04] you've been called to destroy growth
[1:22:06] you keep letting that little thing grow
[1:22:08] and fester and not deal with it and one
[1:22:10] day it's going to show up to destroy not
[1:22:11] only you
[1:22:12] but your family and your lineage and
[1:22:14] take them all out of the house of god
[1:22:16] those little things that you look they
[1:22:18] do more than make you miss church it's
[1:22:19] going to make you miss a rapture
[1:22:21] is what it's going to do deal with
[1:22:22] things deal with things now
[1:22:24] take care of it don't carry it into a
[1:22:25] new year let the new year be a year
[1:22:27] where you're fresh and clean and ready
[1:22:29] to serve god with your whole heart
[1:22:31] deal with those things now that they
[1:22:33] don't crop up in some later generation
[1:22:36] this is the one who saul was supposed to
[1:22:38] destroy
[1:22:39] they're not even supposed to be facing
[1:22:41] this situation
[1:22:43] and everyone references him
[1:22:47] everyone bows to haman except one
[1:22:52] verse 5 chapter 3 verse 5 and when haman
[1:22:56] saw that mordecai
[1:22:58] bowed not nor did him reverence then was
[1:23:01] haman full of wrath
[1:23:03] i like it any time the devil gets full
[1:23:05] of wrath that means i've done something
[1:23:06] right
[1:23:08] and he thought to scorn to lay hands on
[1:23:11] mordecai alone
[1:23:12] for they had showed him the people of
[1:23:14] mordecai
[1:23:15] wherefore haman sought to destroy all
[1:23:17] the jews that were throughout the whole
[1:23:20] kingdom of a hazardous even the people
[1:23:23] of mordecai now what i love about this
[1:23:26] is god
[1:23:27] intended for saul to destroy the
[1:23:29] amalekites
[1:23:30] he was called for it he was called to do
[1:23:33] it he was ordained to do it he was the
[1:23:35] one that was supposed to do it
[1:23:37] they had been a thorn in israel's side
[1:23:39] ever since they crossed the red sea
[1:23:41] they are considered israel's first enemy
[1:23:45] the first enemy to to come against them
[1:23:47] in war
[1:23:48] but saul had failed to carry it out and
[1:23:51] now here stands a direct
[1:23:53] descendant of the amalekites once again
[1:23:56] not just a thorn in the side
[1:23:57] but there to completely and utterly
[1:24:00] destroy them
[1:24:01] and who is it that refuses to bow down
[1:24:04] who is it brother joe it's mordecai
[1:24:08] mordecai refuses to bow down why is that
[1:24:11] such a big deal brother aaron
[1:24:12] go back to chapter 2 verse 5. now in
[1:24:16] shoeshine the palace there was a certain
[1:24:17] jew
[1:24:18] whose name was mordecai the son of jared
[1:24:22] the son of shemiya the son of
[1:24:25] kish of benjaminite you may not remember
[1:24:28] this but saul's father
[1:24:30] was kish so here's god coming back
[1:24:33] around saying your father may not have
[1:24:34] done it
[1:24:35] but i'm giving you mordechai the
[1:24:37] opportunity
[1:24:38] in this year to be a cycle breaker i'm
[1:24:41] giving you the opportunity to do what
[1:24:43] maybe your daddy couldn't do and your
[1:24:45] mama couldn't do
[1:24:46] and other churches couldn't do and your
[1:24:48] brothers maybe couldn't do
[1:24:49] but i believe you'll do it i'm gonna
[1:24:51] give you an opportunity right now
[1:24:53] to be a cycle breaker to destroy those
[1:24:56] curses that have followed your family
[1:24:57] to destroy those spirits that has
[1:24:59] followed your family
[1:25:00] i'm giving you the opportunity right now
[1:25:03] to be a cycle breaker
[1:25:05] to cast it down and say this won't
[1:25:07] hinder me one more day
[1:25:09] this won't hinder me one more hour this
[1:25:11] will not go with me until the new year
[1:25:14] he's given you the opportunity saul
[1:25:16] didn't do it but you can mordecai
[1:25:19] you have the opportunity tonight to deal
[1:25:21] with it
[1:25:23] it's up to you to say my kids won't have
[1:25:25] to fight this
[1:25:27] this won't come up in another generation
[1:25:29] as a matter of fact satan
[1:25:31] i'm here to do what was supposed to do a
[1:25:33] long time ago
[1:25:34] and that's take your head off your
[1:25:37] lineage of torment
[1:25:38] you're lineage of pain your lineage of
[1:25:41] coming down upon the people of god is
[1:25:43] over
[1:25:43] tonight because we are cycle breakers
[1:25:52] maybe others failed to stand maybe other
[1:25:55] churches lost the right to speak for
[1:25:58] maybe others bowed to the pressures of
[1:25:59] the age
[1:26:01] but you won't bend you won't bow
[1:26:05] you're a cycle breaker you've determined
[1:26:08] in your heart they can heat the furnace
[1:26:10] seven times hotter
[1:26:11] he can throw a 20 20 at me i don't care
[1:26:14] i'm not giving up i'm not backing down
[1:26:17] i'm not giving
[1:26:18] in it ends tonight it ends tonight
[1:26:22] because listen when the bride leaves
[1:26:23] this earth there won't be one devil that
[1:26:25] wasn't defeated
[1:26:26] we're not like saul we ain't leaving one
[1:26:28] behind to prop up at some other time
[1:26:30] it's going to be dealt with before we
[1:26:31] leave here and we will leave victorious
[1:26:36] oh how heyman hated that guy yeah
[1:26:39] he hated that guy
[1:26:42] mordecai so he develops a scheme to
[1:26:45] destroy all the jews
[1:26:48] you talk about hard times 474
[1:26:51] bc was a hard time esther 3 13
[1:26:56] in the letters were sent by post into
[1:26:58] all the king's provinces to destroy
[1:27:00] to kill and to cause to perish all jews
[1:27:04] both young and old little children
[1:27:07] women in one day even upon the 13th day
[1:27:11] of the 12th month
[1:27:12] which is the month adar and to take the
[1:27:15] spoil of them
[1:27:16] for a prey what we see here
[1:27:19] is a biblical holocaust about to happen
[1:27:22] you know we were taught that spirits
[1:27:23] don't die they just pass on
[1:27:26] and we see the very same spirit that
[1:27:28] would one day anoint a man named hitler
[1:27:30] and try to wipe out the jews in the
[1:27:32] 1900s
[1:27:33] here upon haman not only that but an
[1:27:36] entire nation became anointed
[1:27:38] germany to where the people did awful
[1:27:39] things and you see that same thing when
[1:27:40] you read the scripture
[1:27:41] this isn't haman going around killing
[1:27:43] these people which is him putting out a
[1:27:44] decree that they all be killed
[1:27:45] and the country comes under that same
[1:27:47] anointing and they're going to do it
[1:27:48] they're going to wipe them out it's the
[1:27:50] exact same thing that we saw in this day
[1:27:54] i'ma skip a little bit of this and
[1:27:58] summarize
[1:28:01] we know that he hates mordecai and he
[1:28:03] wants to destroy him and he comes to
[1:28:04] visit the king
[1:28:05] and if you've read he comes in thinking
[1:28:08] that the king wants to honor him
[1:28:10] haman and the king asked him he says
[1:28:13] what should i do for the man that i want
[1:28:15] to honor what should i do for the man
[1:28:16] that i
[1:28:17] that i want to to glory
[1:28:21] pardon me i'ma skip back
[1:28:27] mordecai learns of his plot and mordecai
[1:28:30] finds out all that's happened unto him
[1:28:32] and and he says in the sum of money that
[1:28:34] haman had promised to pay to the king's
[1:28:35] treasury for the jews
[1:28:37] to destroy them and we're in chapter 4
[1:28:39] and verse 12
[1:28:40] and he's telling esther that she must go
[1:28:43] into the king
[1:28:44] and she must speak and they told in
[1:28:47] verse 12 and they told to mordecai
[1:28:49] esther's words because she's saying i
[1:28:51] can't go in if i go in i'll be killed
[1:28:53] it's very possible that he won't extend
[1:28:54] the scepter to me
[1:28:55] verse 13 then mordecai commanded to
[1:28:57] esther
[1:28:58] think not with thyself that thou shalt
[1:29:01] escape
[1:29:02] in the king's house more than all the
[1:29:03] jews for if thou altogether hold us thy
[1:29:06] peace at this time
[1:29:07] then shall their enlargement and
[1:29:10] deliverance arise to jews from another
[1:29:11] place in other words we're god's people
[1:29:13] god will deliver us
[1:29:15] there will come a deliverance but don't
[1:29:17] think you're gonna escape just because
[1:29:19] you sit back and hold your peace
[1:29:21] don't think that you're gonna get away
[1:29:23] just because you choose not to say
[1:29:24] something
[1:29:25] he says but thou and thy father's house
[1:29:27] shall be destroyed
[1:29:29] and who knoweth whether thou art come to
[1:29:32] the kingdom
[1:29:33] for such a time as this
[1:29:36] and i tell you in the day that we're
[1:29:37] living in right now satan's going about
[1:29:39] killing all that he can kill
[1:29:41] destroying all that he can destroy
[1:29:42] there's cancer there's covet there's
[1:29:44] wickedness there's sin
[1:29:45] there's pornography there's all kind of
[1:29:48] things on every hand and don't think for
[1:29:50] a minute that if you just sit back and
[1:29:51] don't say nothing you just sit back mind
[1:29:53] your business it's going to pass your
[1:29:54] house by
[1:29:55] if i just sit back and don't do anything
[1:29:57] the devil is going to leave me alone if
[1:29:58] i say nothing
[1:29:59] don't think this decree won't affect
[1:30:01] your house
[1:30:02] it will come and it will destroy your
[1:30:04] home it will destroy your children just
[1:30:06] like it will everybody else's listen
[1:30:08] god's people will be delivered he will
[1:30:10] find a source of deliverance but don't
[1:30:12] think you can sit back and avoid this
[1:30:14] plague just because you're not going to
[1:30:15] say anything
[1:30:17] but listen you are on speaking terms
[1:30:19] with the king
[1:30:20] you have been called for such a time as
[1:30:22] this you must go
[1:30:24] into the king you were placed here and
[1:30:26] you were given this message for this
[1:30:28] very time
[1:30:29] you can't just sit back and say maybe it
[1:30:31] won't affect me it will affect you
[1:30:33] it will come for your children it will
[1:30:35] come for your marriage
[1:30:36] so you might as well come you say well
[1:30:38] it may be death to go in it's death not
[1:30:41] to go in
[1:30:42] it's death not to go in brother branham
[1:30:44] talked about the angels guarding the
[1:30:46] tree of life and keeping people the way
[1:30:47] he said but now those same angels
[1:30:49] are pushing you in pushing you into the
[1:30:51] king pushing you in to speak to him
[1:30:53] because you must be on speaking terms
[1:30:58] chapter five verse one now it came to
[1:31:00] pass on the third day that esther put on
[1:31:02] her royal apparel
[1:31:04] and stood in the inner court of the
[1:31:05] king's house over against the king's
[1:31:07] house
[1:31:10] and the king set up on his royal phone
[1:31:11] in the royal house over against the gate
[1:31:13] of the house
[1:31:14] and it was so when he saw when the king
[1:31:17] saw esther
[1:31:18] the queen standing in the court that she
[1:31:20] obtained
[1:31:21] favor in his sight and the king held out
[1:31:25] to esther the golden scepter that was in
[1:31:26] his hand so esther drew near
[1:31:28] and touched the top of the scepter then
[1:31:31] said the king
[1:31:32] unto her what wilt thou
[1:31:35] queen esther just hold it right there
[1:31:38] what wilt thou queen esther can you see
[1:31:42] right here why satan doesn't want you to
[1:31:44] recognize your favor
[1:31:47] can't you see why he doesn't want you to
[1:31:49] go into the king
[1:31:51] listen hear this for yourself right now
[1:31:55] hear this for yourself as you have an
[1:31:57] audience with the king hear this
[1:31:58] scripture for you
[1:31:59] for yourself and apply it to yourself
[1:32:01] from almighty god
[1:32:03] what wilt thou queen esther and what is
[1:32:06] thy request it shall be
[1:32:10] even given thee to half of the kingdom
[1:32:14] you've moved beyond just finding favor
[1:32:17] you've moved beyond just being favored
[1:32:19] but now you
[1:32:20] are favored to speak she took the step
[1:32:22] that vastly never took
[1:32:24] she came into the king and now she's
[1:32:26] taken a step further
[1:32:27] she now has this chance the opportunity
[1:32:30] to speak
[1:32:31] what the the church lost the bride has
[1:32:33] gained
[1:32:34] listen he has never been without a
[1:32:36] mouthpiece god has never been without a
[1:32:39] mouthpiece and somebody in this day
[1:32:41] is going to take the word and put it
[1:32:42] upon their lips and begin to speak with
[1:32:44] authority
[1:32:45] he will not be without a mouthpiece in
[1:32:46] this day either
[1:32:48] brother branham says revelation 10 7 and
[1:32:51] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:32:52] messenger when he shall begin to sound
[1:32:54] the mystery of god shall be finished
[1:32:56] as he hath declared to his servants the
[1:32:58] prophets there it is
[1:33:00] he is sending a vindicated prophet he is
[1:33:02] sending a prophet after almost 2
[1:33:04] thousand years
[1:33:04] he is sending someone who is so far from
[1:33:06] organization education in the world of
[1:33:08] religion
[1:33:09] that is john the baptist and elijah of
[1:33:11] old he will hear only from god
[1:33:13] and he will have thus saith the lord and
[1:33:15] speak for god
[1:33:16] he will be god's mouthpiece and as it is
[1:33:19] declared in malachi 4 6
[1:33:21] will turn the hearts of the children
[1:33:22] back to the fathers
[1:33:24] he will bring back the elect of the last
[1:33:26] day
[1:33:27] and they will hear a vindicated prophet
[1:33:29] and give the exact truth as it was with
[1:33:31] paul now listen
[1:33:32] he will restore the truth as they had it
[1:33:35] and those
[1:33:36] elect with him in that day will be the
[1:33:39] ones
[1:33:40] who manifest the lord and be his body
[1:33:43] and be
[1:33:43] his voice and perform his works
[1:33:46] hallelujah he said the lutheran spoke
[1:33:50] for god at that time but they organized
[1:33:52] and again the pure word was lost for
[1:33:54] organization tens towards dogma creeds
[1:33:56] and not simple word
[1:33:58] they could no longer speak for god then
[1:34:00] god sent wesley and he was the voice
[1:34:02] with the word in his day
[1:34:04] the people who took his revelation from
[1:34:05] god became the living epistles read and
[1:34:07] known of all men for their generation
[1:34:10] when the methodist failed god raised up
[1:34:12] others and so it has gone on through the
[1:34:14] years until
[1:34:15] this last day there is again another
[1:34:18] people in the land who under their
[1:34:20] messenger
[1:34:21] will be the final voice to the final age
[1:34:24] he said the church is no longer the
[1:34:26] mouthpiece of god it is its own
[1:34:28] mouthpiece
[1:34:29] so god is turning on her he will
[1:34:30] confound her through the prophet and the
[1:34:32] bride for the voice of god will
[1:34:34] be in her oh what to god the church were
[1:34:38] cold or hot
[1:34:39] best of all she should be fervent but
[1:34:41] she's not sentence has been passed she
[1:34:43] is no longer god's voice to the world
[1:34:45] she will maintain that she is but god
[1:34:47] says not
[1:34:48] oh god still has a voice for the people
[1:34:51] of the world
[1:34:52] even as he has given a voice to the
[1:34:54] little bride the voice
[1:34:56] is in the bride the voice
[1:34:59] is in the bride and so we must come to
[1:35:02] the place where we use that voice
[1:35:04] where we stand with authority because
[1:35:06] we're on speaking terms and we speak to
[1:35:07] our mountains
[1:35:08] we speak to the things that are
[1:35:09] hindering us
[1:35:12] chapter 5 verse 4
[1:35:16] and esther answered if it seems good
[1:35:18] unto the king
[1:35:20] notice her attitude she's already
[1:35:21] received favor she's already been given
[1:35:23] permission to speak
[1:35:25] if it seemed good unto the king let the
[1:35:27] king and haman come this day unto the
[1:35:28] banquet that i have prepared for him
[1:35:30] then the king said cause haman to make
[1:35:33] haste that he may do as esther has said
[1:35:35] so the king and haman came to the
[1:35:36] banquet that esther had prepared
[1:35:39] and the king said unto esther at the
[1:35:41] banquet of wine what is thy petition and
[1:35:43] it shall be granted thee
[1:35:44] what is that request even to the half of
[1:35:46] the kingdom and it shall
[1:35:47] be performed then answered esther and
[1:35:50] said my petition and my request is
[1:35:52] look once again if i have found favor
[1:35:56] in thy sight of the king and if it
[1:35:58] pleased the king
[1:35:59] to grant my petition and to perform my
[1:36:02] request let the king and haman
[1:36:03] come to the banquet that i shall prepare
[1:36:05] for them and i will do it tomorrow as
[1:36:07] the king has said
[1:36:08] notice time after time after time esther
[1:36:12] would say
[1:36:13] if i found favor but she's already been
[1:36:16] told she's favored
[1:36:18] but lord if i found favor today lord if
[1:36:21] it pleases you
[1:36:21] right now lord i want to be in your will
[1:36:24] today
[1:36:24] i know you chose me we've been married
[1:36:27] five years
[1:36:28] i know you you told me yesterday i had
[1:36:30] your favor but today lord
[1:36:32] if i found favor she's staying
[1:36:35] on speaking terms because she wants
[1:36:39] what he wants and this is how she stays
[1:36:41] in favor this is how she stays on
[1:36:43] speaking terms brother branham would say
[1:36:46] find favor before you ask for a favor
[1:36:50] find favor before you ask for a favor
[1:36:53] and this is why we seek his favor daily
[1:36:56] even though we already have had it
[1:36:57] bestowed upon us
[1:37:00] esther five and nine and we're going to
[1:37:01] go through these pretty quickly as i try
[1:37:03] to bring this down then went haman forth
[1:37:06] that day
[1:37:07] joyful and with a glad heart but when
[1:37:09] haman saw mordecai in the king's gate
[1:37:12] that he stood not up nor moved for him
[1:37:14] he was full of indignation
[1:37:16] against mordecai nevertheless haman
[1:37:19] refrained himself and when he came home
[1:37:21] he sent and called for his friends
[1:37:23] and zerish his wife and haman told them
[1:37:26] of the glory of his riches and the
[1:37:28] multitude of his children and all the
[1:37:30] things wherein the king had promoted him
[1:37:32] and how he had advanced him above the
[1:37:34] princes and the servants of the king
[1:37:36] haman said moreover yea esther the queen
[1:37:38] did let no man come in with the king
[1:37:40] unto the banquet that she had prepared
[1:37:42] but myself
[1:37:43] and tomorrow i am invited unto her also
[1:37:45] with the king
[1:37:47] yet all this availeth me nothing
[1:37:51] so long as i see mordecai the jew
[1:37:54] sitting
[1:37:54] at the king's gate i gotta tell you this
[1:37:56] actually gives me great joy
[1:37:59] to know that satan glories in all that
[1:38:02] he has accomplished
[1:38:03] that satan glories in this eden that he
[1:38:06] has made here upon the earth
[1:38:07] that he is so pleased that he holds all
[1:38:09] the political powers of the world in his
[1:38:11] hand
[1:38:11] that he holds professed christians and
[1:38:13] professed churches in his hand
[1:38:16] and yet he says it gives me no joy
[1:38:19] because of that group of people sitting
[1:38:21] there in the king's gate
[1:38:22] that group of people that's sitting down
[1:38:24] there in my eden ruining it it gives me
[1:38:26] no joy
[1:38:27] it gives me nothing because they are
[1:38:29] sitting there and they're ruined as long
[1:38:31] as those people are sitting there
[1:38:32] i am tormented as long as those people
[1:38:34] are overcoming and eating i am tormented
[1:38:37] and he says it availeth me
[1:38:39] nothing satan has accomplished nothing
[1:38:41] because of you
[1:38:42] he has accomplished nothing because
[1:38:44] every scheme he's brought against you
[1:38:46] you've overcome it he has accomplished
[1:38:48] nothing because you will not bow and you
[1:38:49] knew what i've been and he says
[1:38:51] i have accomplished nothing
[1:38:56] esther 5 14 then says there is his wife
[1:38:59] and all his friends unto him
[1:39:00] let a gallows be made 50 cubits high and
[1:39:03] tomorrow speak thou unto the king that
[1:39:05] mordecai may be hanged thereon
[1:39:07] then go thou in merrily with the king
[1:39:08] unto the banquet and the
[1:39:10] thing pleased haman and he caused the
[1:39:13] gallows to be made
[1:39:16] then in verse in chapter six that's
[1:39:18] where i was telling you earlier where he
[1:39:19] comes into the court and he thinks the
[1:39:21] king wants to honor him and so the king
[1:39:23] asked him what should be done to the man
[1:39:24] that i desire to honor and he
[1:39:26] he tells him all these things that he
[1:39:28] should do oh you should put your clothes
[1:39:29] upon him in the crown and you should put
[1:39:31] him on your horse and
[1:39:32] you should lead him through the city and
[1:39:34] say this is the man that the king
[1:39:35] delighteth in and
[1:39:37] because he's thinking it's going to
[1:39:37] happen to him but what he doesn't know
[1:39:40] is the king has found that that mordecai
[1:39:42] had never been rightfully recognized for
[1:39:44] his deeds that had saved the king's life
[1:39:46] and he says well do all that you said
[1:39:48] and go do it unto mordecai
[1:39:50] and so we pick up this story in chapter
[1:39:52] 6 verse 11
[1:39:53] then took haman the apparel and the
[1:39:55] horse and arrayed mordecai
[1:39:57] and brought him on the horse back
[1:39:59] through the street of the city and
[1:40:00] proclaimed before him
[1:40:02] thus shall it be done unto the man whom
[1:40:04] the king delighteth to honor
[1:40:06] and mordecai came again to the king's
[1:40:08] gate but haman hasted to his house
[1:40:10] mourning and having his head covered
[1:40:13] the devil went home like a dog with his
[1:40:15] tail between his legs
[1:40:17] he was whooped and mortal and haman told
[1:40:21] zerus his
[1:40:22] wife and all his friends everything that
[1:40:24] had befallen him
[1:40:25] then said his wise men and xerath his
[1:40:28] wife unto him
[1:40:29] now listen to this i love this if
[1:40:31] mordecai
[1:40:33] be of the seed of the jews before thou
[1:40:36] hast begun
[1:40:37] to fall thou shalt not prevail against
[1:40:40] him
[1:40:41] but shall surely fall before him
[1:40:45] his own wife tells him you're doomed you
[1:40:47] stand no chance
[1:40:48] there's no way you're going to defeat it
[1:40:50] look i really hope there's some smart
[1:40:51] mouth little devil
[1:40:52] sitting down in hell right now that
[1:40:54] always tells the devil
[1:40:55] that plant ain't going to work either
[1:41:02] that you don't tried for for all these
[1:41:03] years and let me what's it got you
[1:41:06] yo you don't understand this time i got
[1:41:07] them you don't know the plans i have for
[1:41:09] them you don't know the gallows i have
[1:41:11] built for them you don't know the
[1:41:12] struggles it's facing
[1:41:14] ain't gonna work it's not gonna work
[1:41:17] because if they bear that royal seed of
[1:41:20] abraham
[1:41:21] if they be of that seed the one that
[1:41:23] conquered you the one that defeated you
[1:41:25] if they be of that seed
[1:41:26] you will fall before them you've already
[1:41:29] started to fall before them you will not
[1:41:31] conquer you
[1:41:32] will not overcome but they will conquer
[1:41:34] you
[1:41:35] they will overcome you
[1:41:37] [Applause]
[1:41:45] if they be of that seed you don't stand
[1:41:47] a chance
[1:41:50] and while they were yet talking with him
[1:41:52] came the king's chamberlain's
[1:41:54] and hastened to bring haman into the
[1:41:56] banquet that esther had prepared
[1:42:00] we're bringing this to a close now as we
[1:42:01] go to esther chapter 7 and verse 1.
[1:42:04] why must we stay on speaking terms
[1:42:09] because you may only get one chance at
[1:42:11] it
[1:42:13] you may only get one shot at it don't
[1:42:16] miss your chance
[1:42:17] be ready to speak be ready to go in
[1:42:21] be ready to expose him because exposing
[1:42:23] always brings victory
[1:42:26] so the king and haman came to banquet
[1:42:28] with esther the queen
[1:42:30] and the king said again unto esther on
[1:42:32] the second day at the banquet of wine
[1:42:33] what is thy petition queen esther
[1:42:36] and it shall be granted thee and what is
[1:42:38] thy request and it shall be performed
[1:42:40] even to half the kingdom this is it
[1:42:45] this is the moment the only way at this
[1:42:48] point that haman can survive
[1:42:50] is if esther backs out is if esther gets
[1:42:54] scared
[1:42:55] if esther begins to worry am i worthy am
[1:42:58] i prayed up
[1:43:00] can i speak it am i good enough look to
[1:43:03] the atonement
[1:43:05] look to the atonement look to the worthy
[1:43:08] lamb
[1:43:09] look the only way he can continue to
[1:43:11] torment the only way you will not be
[1:43:13] victorious in this moment is if you
[1:43:15] remain silent
[1:43:17] oh but i've been such a failure in 2020
[1:43:19] brother aaron
[1:43:20] i i got my eyes on the wrong things i
[1:43:22] can't go in esther it's time to speak
[1:43:25] but i've been going through a lot of
[1:43:27] things i'm not sure i could esther
[1:43:29] it's time to speak it's time to speak
[1:43:32] right now esther
[1:43:33] what if he rejects me what what if he
[1:43:35] rejects me when i go and he's not going
[1:43:37] to reject you
[1:43:38] he's not he's already told you you're
[1:43:39] favored he's already told you you're
[1:43:41] favored to speak
[1:43:42] he already told you that you would be
[1:43:44] the mouthpiece in this day speak
[1:43:45] esther now is the time to speak there's
[1:43:48] no tomorrow
[1:43:49] there's no other age we can put this off
[1:43:51] too we can't keep putting these things
[1:43:52] off the age after hey this is the age
[1:43:55] this is the day this is the year this is
[1:43:57] the moment right now
[1:43:58] speak esther then esther the queen
[1:44:01] answered and said if i have found favor
[1:44:02] in the
[1:44:03] sido king and if it please the king let
[1:44:05] my life be given me at my petition
[1:44:08] and my people at my request for we are
[1:44:10] sold
[1:44:11] i and my people to be destroyed to be
[1:44:13] slain and to perish but if we had been
[1:44:16] sold for bond men and bond women
[1:44:17] i had held my tongue although the enemy
[1:44:19] could not countervail the king's damage
[1:44:21] then king of hazarus answered and said
[1:44:23] unto esther the queen
[1:44:25] who is he and where is he that durst
[1:44:27] presume in his heart to do so
[1:44:29] and esther said the adversary and the
[1:44:32] enemy
[1:44:33] is this wicked haman then haman was
[1:44:36] afraid before the king
[1:44:38] and the queen listen you've been granted
[1:44:40] an audience with the king tonight

[1:45:13] stay tormented the only way you don't
[1:45:15] win
[1:45:16] is if you remain silent the only way is
[1:45:19] if you choose not to speak
[1:45:21] why sit there until you die why sit
[1:45:23] there until your joy is robbed

[1:45:38] it's your age it's your time you are
[1:45:40] here for such
[1:45:42] a time is this church
[1:45:45] life is in your words and death is in
[1:45:48] your silence

[1:45:52] silence in 2021 speak the word

[1:46:01] wants you to remain silent he wants you
[1:46:02] to remain bashful he wants you to step

[1:46:05] because he knows when you speak he
[1:46:06] stands no chance
[1:46:08] when you speak he is defeated
[1:46:11] when you speak mountains move when you
[1:46:14] speak and hold on to the word the
[1:46:16] prodigal is coming home when you speak
[1:46:18] cancers healed

[1:46:54] not for you you get eternal life
[1:46:58] you get the kingdom you get all that you
[1:47:01] have need of
[1:47:02] he is the one found guilty he is the one
[1:47:04] that goes to the gallows
[1:47:06] verse nine in harmony one of the
[1:47:08] chamberlain said before the king behold
[1:47:10] also the galley's 50
[1:47:11] gallows 50 cubits high which haman had
[1:47:14] made for mordecai
[1:47:15] who had spoken good for the king
[1:47:17] standeth in the house of haman
[1:47:19] and then ham and then the king said hang
[1:47:22] him
[1:47:23] there on so they hang haman on the
[1:47:26] gallows that he had prepared for
[1:47:28] mordecai
[1:47:29] then was the king's wrath pacified
[1:47:33] haman was trying to destroy someone who
[1:47:34] had found favor with the king
[1:47:38] but once you realize church how to
[1:47:40] operate that favor
[1:47:41] haman didn't stand a chance once you
[1:47:44] realize i'm favored
[1:47:45] i'm called and it's just up to me to
[1:47:47] speak that devil of torment stands no
[1:47:50] chance against you
[1:47:51] listen that's just the beginning that's
[1:47:53] just the beginning we've run out of time
[1:47:54] that's just the beginning because it's
[1:47:56] in the unveiling
[1:47:58] it's in the exposing that the victory
[1:48:00] comes the exposing brings victory
[1:48:02] because
[1:48:03] it's in the following chapters that the
[1:48:04] king allows the jews to go out and fight
[1:48:06] against their enemies and in one day
[1:48:07] they kill 75 000 of those that would
[1:48:10] have killed them
[1:48:10] and then the next day they hang not just
[1:48:12] haman but they finish the job saul
[1:48:14] didn't they hang all of haman's sons
[1:48:16] it's in the exposing that the victory
[1:48:18] comes it's 20 21
[1:48:20] it's time for you to start speaking and
[1:48:21] then look for victories to come
[1:48:23] look for a series of victories it shall
[1:48:25] be walk in victory talking victory speak
[1:48:28] your victory
[1:48:28] rise to the occasion and speak because
[1:48:30] it's what you have
[1:48:32] been called to do
[1:48:39] it is time to speak brother branham says
[1:48:43] this
