[41:12] root out of dry ground he has no he had
[41:15] no form no comeliness and when we shall
[41:18] see him there's no beauty that we should
[41:21] desire him he has despised and rejected
[41:24] of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with
[41:26] grief
[41:27] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[41:30] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[41:33] but surely Heath borne our griefs and
[41:36] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[41:39] him stricken smitten of God and
[41:42] Afflicted but he was wounded for our
[41:45] transgressions he was bruised for our
[41:47] iniquities and the chastisement of our
[41:50] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[41:54] we are
[41:55] healed also John John chapter 19 and: 30
[41:59] so when Jesus therefore had received the
[42:02] vinegar he said it is finished and he
[42:06] bowed his head and gave up the ghost
[42:10] amen God bless you be
[42:13] seated it's a very wonderful passage of
[42:16] scripture that we read here today and uh
[42:20] something that we refer to quite a bit
[42:23] especially the the part of he was
[42:25] wounded for our transgression and bruis
[42:28] for our iniquities and the chastisement
[42:31] of our peace with was upon him and by
[42:34] his stripes we were heal are
[42:36] healed and you know we look at that a
[42:38] lot and we uh we we Ponder on it we we
[42:43] believe it we we repeat it we do all
[42:46] these things but uh I want you to
[42:49] understand that is a finished scripture
[42:51] that is fulfilled amen and I I'd like to
[42:54] speak to you on faith in the finished
[42:56] work
[42:58] you know is when Jesus would come to
[42:59] that moment and he would bow his head
[43:02] head as his Spirit would leave his body
[43:05] these last words were captured and wrote
[43:07] by John it is finished and you can read
[43:11] a lot of things on those three words
[43:13] but a lot of lot of lot of them say it's
[43:16] a word that means the debt is paid the
[43:19] price is is has been
[43:21] fulfilled uh but we know as a prophet of
[43:24] God would speak about it he said when
[43:26] when he bowed his head and he closed his
[43:28] eyes and that work was finished amen the
[43:32] back of Satan was broken amen it
[43:35] destroyed his works and his claim upon
[43:37] humanity and his claim upon the Earth
[43:40] and his claim upon your body and his
[43:42] claim that he had it took it all away
[43:45] and and I'm thankful to know that God
[43:47] cannot say anything without it being
[43:51] fulfilled amen when he speaks it is a
[43:54] finished work when he speaks it's just
[43:56] as good is it's already happened amen
[43:59] that gives us a basis to put our faith
[44:01] when God speaks a word it's finished
[44:04] well you know what about all the
[44:05] promises that he has given us and and
[44:08] things that are laying there in the word
[44:10] everything that he said is already a
[44:13] finished work amen therefore when we
[44:16] receive his word into our heart it's
[44:18] already done it's completed you know you
[44:21] know what what what if Jesus himself was
[44:24] in that in that flesh was standing here
[44:26] with this shirt on and these this outfit
[44:28] on here today you could come up and
[44:30] maybe say Jesus will you heal me and he
[44:32] would look at you and say you know my
[44:34] child I've already done that I was
[44:37] wounded for your transgressions and by
[44:39] my stripes you were healed it is a
[44:42] finished work you say well Jesus will
[44:44] you save me will will you save me that's
[44:47] not the question he's already done it
[44:50] the price has already prid you know Lord
[44:53] Jesus I I accept your atonement see you
[44:55] were saved back there you were healed
[44:58] back there but by faith now you you
[45:01] believe in what's already been done and
[45:04] what's already be been completed this is
[45:06] where Peter would come right along and
[45:08] he would take the scripture from you are
[45:10] healed to you were healed in First Peter
[45:13] 2 and4 24 he said by whose Stripes ye
[45:17] were healed in other words it is a
[45:19] finished work it is done is completed
[45:22] the price forever healing tonight has
[45:24] already been paid the price forever
[45:27] salvation tonight is already been paid
[45:29] the price that you for every promise of
[45:32] God that is written here that we need
[45:34] between here and glory is already paid
[45:36] for amen amen we can read about it I
[45:39] like to read it and amplify it as I
[45:40] added this just a few moments ago it's
[45:42] so beautiful 1 Peter 2 and verse 21 says
[45:45] for as a Believer you have been called
[45:47] for this purpose for Christ suffered for
[45:50] you leaving you an example that you may
[45:52] follow in his footsteps he committed no
[45:55] sin nor was deceit ever found in his
[45:57] mouth while being reviled and insulted
[46:00] he did not revile or insult and return
[46:03] while suffering he made no threats of
[46:05] Vengeance but kept trusting himself
[46:08] entrusting himself to him who judges
[46:11] fairly he personally carried your sin in
[46:14] his body on the cross willingly offering
[46:17] himself on it as an altar of sacrifice
[46:20] so that we might die to sin becoming
[46:22] immune from the penalty and power of sin
[46:26] and live for righteousness for by his
[46:29] wounds you who believe have already been
[46:32] healed Hallelujah you who believe are
[46:36] already been healed you were continually
[46:38] wandering like so many sheep but now you
[46:41] have come back to the shepherd and
[46:43] guardian of your soul so God's word is
[46:46] there it's already a finished work it's
[46:49] already done it's already the paid for
[46:51] amen but you have to believe it you have
[46:53] to put Faith in it you have to say this
[46:56] is not just some man's IDE ideology or
[46:59] some man's idea but this is the word of
[47:01] God spoken amen by the prophets of God
[47:05] Amen the anointing of God anointing men
[47:07] in their hour that they're lived in to
[47:09] speak words and these words amen came
[47:12] from the Throne of God you have to have
[47:14] the faith to believe that you have to
[47:15] have the faith to stand upon that when
[47:17] all hell is against you and it says
[47:20] you'll never get heal when the doctor
[47:21] says you're going to die when the doctor
[47:23] says there's no hope you have to have
[47:26] faith that the word is spoken and it's
[47:28] already done it doesn't matter what
[47:30] anybody says from hence forth it's
[47:33] already finished therefore I put my
[47:36] faith in a finished work amen amen not
[47:39] something that the doctor can say and we
[47:41] we appreciate doctors not something that
[47:43] medical science can come up with we
[47:45] appreciate what they've been able to do
[47:47] but God has already spoken about your
[47:50] sickness God has already spoken about
[47:53] your sin God has already dealt with it
[47:56] he's already paid for it it's already
[47:58] done amen you say well this is old hat
[48:00] well start believing it start believing
[48:04] that God has already done it and it's
[48:09] finished amen there is no man we know of
[48:12] that can heal us there's no man that we
[48:14] know of can save us because both healing
[48:18] and salvation is past
[48:22] tense the devil likes to put it off in
[48:24] the future somewhere that's the trick of
[48:26] the enemy he wants to put well one of
[48:28] these days I'm going to receive healing
[48:30] no I've already got it it's already paid
[48:33] for amen it's a truth when Jesus Christ
[48:36] died at Calvary he was wounded for our
[48:39] transgressions and by his stripes you
[48:41] were healed it is a finished work not
[48:44] the only thing that not that not the
[48:46] only thing that you have to do it to
[48:48] either receive your salvation or your
[48:50] healing is to accept what Christ has
[48:54] already done for you amen it's not
[48:57] something coming in the
[49:00] future come on Amen the Fulfillment of
[49:03] your body receiving it may be a future
[49:06] tense but the price is already paid amen
[49:09] the price for it is not coming it's
[49:12] already been here it's already done so
[49:15] therefore we can have confidence though
[49:17] I may not feel it it's not about how I
[49:20] feel it's about what the word said
[49:22] therefore I can stand upon the word and
[49:25] believe it though I may be feeling bad
[49:27] though make things may be all out of out
[49:29] of out of order in my life or in my body
[49:32] I can still say what the word says by
[49:35] his stripes I was
[49:38] healed amen it's already been paid for
[49:41] he said you know as we look at at God
[49:44] when a 100 billion Sons would look at
[49:48] God in eternity and his Holiness he said
[49:50] when a 100 billion Sons would look black
[49:52] to him when angels look dirty in his
[49:54] sight that's Jehovah but he became a
[49:57] little baby born in a manure Pile in a
[50:00] Manger that still Jehovah and that still
[50:03] Jehovah here tonight through his grace
[50:05] and through his blood he cleanses his
[50:07] church and he puts us in a position to
[50:11] receive all these blessings he's already
[50:13] paid for
[50:15] us come on somebody that's shouting
[50:18] grounds right there it ain't something
[50:19] I've done to to inherit or or to to to
[50:23] to be for it to be poured out on me God
[50:25] has placed me in in this position he has
[50:28] given me the rights he has given me the
[50:30] rights as his son to receive the
[50:33] blessings he's already paid
[50:35] for it's my inheritance is what God's
[50:38] already given me now you know he said
[50:40] here stands a whole line of people he
[50:41] said I I've never seen any of them as
[50:43] far as I know none now many of you have
[50:46] been in meetings and I I know what
[50:47] discernment is all of you do don't you
[50:50] what we know that I it's I've had it
[50:52] over and over and over that is a gift he
[50:54] said but that doesn't make the Holy
[50:56] Spirit in me any greater than anybody
[51:00] else well I wish we was in the days of
[51:02] brother brandom it ain't about to be in
[51:04] in the days of brother brandom it's
[51:05] about the days of God cuz he's a god of
[51:10] Miracles amen the god the day of God is
[51:13] still here so the day of Miracles are
[51:15] still here they said that's just a gift
[51:17] at work with the Holy Spirit no
[51:20] matter if it's in a little housewife or
[51:24] a little boy or a drunker that just got
[51:27] saved and filled with the Holy Ghost
[51:29] he's got the same holy spirit that any
[51:31] one of us
[51:34] got come on somebody so it's NE that's
[51:37] what the devil wants you to put he wants
[51:39] you to put it back 50 years ago or 10
[51:41] years in the future no if youve got the
[51:43] Holy Ghost it's the same one that
[51:45] operated in William
[51:47] bradam it's the same one that overcomes
[51:50] sicknesses and diseases of every kind is
[51:53] the same one still in the body of Jesus
[51:55] Christ tonight it doesn't matter who you
[51:59] are where you come from but God gives
[52:03] gifts with the Holy Spirit to work it's
[52:06] a confirmation to lift up an enzy the
[52:09] preacher no to lift up
[52:12] Christ come on now that's what
[52:15] testimonies are about testimonies are
[52:17] now not about lifting up anybody but
[52:22] Christ you know people get the wrong
[52:24] idea about testimonies they think well
[52:26] you're just trying to make yourself
[52:27] somebody well if you're a true Christian
[52:29] you're not if you're a true called Holy
[52:32] Ghost preacher you're not trying to lift
[52:34] you up you're trying to tell others what
[52:37] Christ
[52:39] did come on somebody we we we have a
[52:42] whole a whole books of examples tapes of
[52:45] examples of what a prophet did he would
[52:47] get up and he would begin to testify of
[52:50] what God done in present
[52:53] tense cuz he's trying to bring it
[52:55] present tense not 50 years ago before
[52:58] him or 100 Years or or 2,000 years he's
[53:02] trying to let us know that God is here
[53:04] now no more than me or brother Tim
[53:06] brother Ron whoever gets up and
[53:08] testifies about what God has done maybe
[53:11] in our ministry maybe in somebody else's
[53:13] Ministry maybe in a housewife laying
[53:15] hands we heard about whatever amen we're
[53:18] here to testify why because we're
[53:20] telling you God's not past tense our
[53:23] future he is now
[53:26] and we're lifting him up out of history
[53:29] and telling you he's not just a god of
[53:30] William bradam he's your God he's not
[53:34] the God just 60 years ago or 2,000 years
[53:37] ago or billions of years ago he's the
[53:39] same one
[53:41] today he can heal today he can save
[53:44] today he can set the B of Sinner free
[53:46] today he's that kind of
[53:52] God we believe tonight that Jesus Christ
[53:56] is the Son of God how many believe that
[53:59] all right Born of the Virgin Mary
[54:01] suffered under pilate crucified rose on
[54:03] the third day ascended up into heaven
[54:05] and sits at the right hand of the
[54:08] Majesty of God tonight there ever living
[54:11] to make intercession Upon Our confession
[54:14] therefore he cannot intercede for us
[54:17] until we confess that he did the
[54:20] work it's a finished
[54:23] work but it's not finished necessarily
[54:26] when you see it's finished it's finished
[54:29] when he said it's
[54:30] finished therefore you have to confess
[54:33] it well brother Timothy I don't feel I
[54:35] don't it ain't got you're not confessing
[54:36] your
[54:40] feelings what a terrible this service
[54:42] this would be if we all just got here
[54:43] and confessed our
[54:46] feelings come on how bad we felt how bad
[54:50] we'd been how bad this was and
[54:54] how brother je forny would say we we'd
[54:56] be all in the wowy wowy wounds before we
[54:58] left this place if we just got if I just
[55:02] got up here and confessed my feelings
[55:04] how I
[55:06] felt CU I don't know if you know this or
[55:08] not but a preacher don't always feel
[55:10] like
[55:11] preaching he don't always feel like
[55:14] getting up in front of you and speaking
[55:17] the word of God it but it ain't on our
[55:20] feelings it's on the gift that God has
[55:22] placed in our life amen that God will
[55:25] somehow be beyond all the feelings
[55:27] beyond all the things will still shine
[55:29] through with his word and liberate his
[55:32] people that's why we push through our
[55:36] feelings
[55:38] amen but he's there to make make
[55:41] intercede upon your confession some some
[55:45] people get the idea that you're making a
[55:46] mockery of of the Gospel when you say
[55:48] you're healed and your body hasn't
[55:50] showed up yet hadn't met up yet you're
[55:53] not making a mockery you're not
[55:54] confessing your body you're conf in the
[55:59] word said I might make this statement
[56:01] that all healing and all salvation is
[56:04] what God has achieved for us through
[56:06] Christ it's already a finished
[56:10] work now bear that in mind as you prayed
[56:13] for and tell your friends that there's
[56:15] nothing that we can do to improve it
[56:18] nothing we can do to further it the only
[56:21] thing we can do is teach it that it's
[56:23] already been achieved amen it's already
[56:27] been done amen as long as the devil puts
[56:31] it out there like a carrot on a in front
[56:33] of a donkey and you're following this
[56:35] thing trying to get there you'll never
[56:36] get there but when you realize it's
[56:39] already been paid for and I have the
[56:41] right as a son or daughter to go cash in
[56:44] the
[56:46] check cuz there's enough deposit in the
[56:48] bank now some of y'all might might worry
[56:50] about sometimes when you write a check
[56:52] and and you've sent it out and you don't
[56:54] know if when it gets there or if
[56:55] everything's going to work out just
[56:57] right and you'll have money there when
[56:58] it happens how I ain't even going to ask
[57:00] how many's ever bounced a
[57:02] check I
[57:05] have amen but what but listen when you
[57:08] write a check amen in the that's been
[57:11] written by the bank of
[57:14] heaven and he said he signed his name at
[57:17] the bottom of
[57:19] it amen you can write it out and you
[57:22] don't have to worry about if there's
[57:24] enough funds in the bank
[57:27] cuz this bank has never been bankrupt
[57:29] it's never been in the red it's never
[57:32] been down where it couldn't fulfill the
[57:34] promises of God but when by faith you
[57:36] write it out and you send it there it
[57:39] will be
[57:40] fulfilled it might not come when you
[57:43] want it it might not come exactly the
[57:45] time that you expect but God is God and
[57:48] when God moves God moves
[57:56] God himself did that at Forest of
[57:59] Calvary he was wounded for our
[58:01] transgressions he was bruised for our
[58:03] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[58:05] was upon him and with his stripes we
[58:08] were healed it's past tense now it's up
[58:13] to you and I to appropriate the faith to
[58:17] accept what Christ has already done for
[58:21] us and the moment we accept it and
[58:24] confess that he's done it then he
[58:26] sitting at the right hand of God to make
[58:28] intercessions Upon Our confession the
[58:30] word confess there's the same word as
[58:32] profess profess it says but profess and
[58:35] confess same word to profess it was done
[58:38] to confess it comes from the same Greek
[58:39] word we know that we must confess that
[58:42] he's already done it he cannot do it
[58:45] until we confess it and then he's a high
[58:47] priest to make
[58:52] intercession that makes a faith in a
[58:55] finished work that Christ did for us at
[58:59] Calvary I I love what brother Murphy
[59:01] used that example on fire and
[59:04] forget
[59:06] beautiful amen it's time that we let we
[59:08] put the word of God in action and we Let
[59:12] it Loose we walk away and forget about
[59:14] it and just remember God's going to
[59:17] fulfill what he said he was going to
[59:19] do come on well brother Timothy I got to
[59:22] knock and keep on knocking yeah I I I
[59:24] believe in that
[59:26] it's Bible but I don't see in there
[59:29] anywhere that he says go get a preacher
[59:31] and he pray for you over and over and
[59:33] over and that's how you knock and keep
[59:34] on knocking no sir that's not how it is
[59:37] that's between you and God but you know
[59:40] the knocking he wants to hear is not the
[59:42] knocking of
[59:44] unbelief come on somebody he wants the
[59:47] knocking Lord I'm still here but I'm
[59:49] praising you anyhow I'm still here
[59:52] because I know you're going to send it
[59:54] you're going to do it you're going to
[59:55] fulfill I'm still knocking because I
[59:58] know God I'm going to just right now
[1:00:00] praise you as you already done it as if
[1:00:03] it's already done because it
[1:00:06] is come on somebody if I could just get
[1:00:09] you to realize your sons and your
[1:00:12] daughters are already
[1:00:16] back come on somebody amen we may be
[1:00:20] looking at it in a in our own eyes and
[1:00:23] we well I don't see him back what are
[1:00:24] you talking about but by God's he's
[1:00:26] already saw them and he put in his word
[1:00:29] you shall be there and your Offspring
[1:00:32] with
[1:00:33] you how could he see that without him
[1:00:36] already seeing them
[1:00:41] there come on somebody that ought to get
[1:00:44] somebody to say
[1:00:46] Glory he's already saw my son delivered
[1:00:49] he's already saw him amen before the
[1:00:52] foundation of the world he said I'm
[1:00:53] going to pay for that one and I'm going
[1:00:55] to pay for that one and I got enough
[1:00:57] blood for that one and I got enough
[1:00:59] blood for that one it doesn't matter how
[1:01:01] far the devil takes him I got enough
[1:01:04] [Applause]
[1:01:09] blood it's already done it's a finished
[1:01:12] work Divine Healing is not based on some
[1:01:17] emotion well I feel
[1:01:21] good doesn't necessarily mean you're
[1:01:24] healed just means you feel feel
[1:01:27] good but it's not well I feel bad
[1:01:30] doesn't do necessarily mean you're not
[1:01:35] healed come on
[1:01:38] somebody we ought to be enough students
[1:01:41] of the message to realize amen when a
[1:01:43] disease is cast out am was about 72
[1:01:46] hours of decaying in your body and the
[1:01:50] body goes through things trying to get
[1:01:51] rid of it and the fever will get higher
[1:01:53] this will get worse and we say well I
[1:01:55] just wish we got something that
[1:02:00] last well if you just kept confessing
[1:02:02] your healing your body would have went
[1:02:04] through completely and done but as soon
[1:02:07] as those negative thoughts came into
[1:02:08] your mind and you begin to put them out
[1:02:10] your mouth your body went the other
[1:02:14] way come on Divine Healing is not based
[1:02:19] upon some emotion we want an emotion we
[1:02:21] want we want to feel
[1:02:23] good it got nothing to do with it is not
[1:02:26] based upon some laying on hands or some
[1:02:29] strange feeling or sensation it's based
[1:02:32] upon faith and a work that was done for
[1:02:34] you by Jesus at
[1:02:37] Calvary amen it's a finished product and
[1:02:40] every
[1:02:41] person how many persons we got here
[1:02:44] tonight all right let's just narrow it
[1:02:46] now how many sick persons do we have
[1:02:48] here
[1:02:49] tonight come on how many sick persons
[1:02:52] every person tonight that's sick or
[1:02:54] Afflicted and as far as God's concerned
[1:02:58] you're already
[1:03:03] healed amen as far as God's concerned
[1:03:06] you're already healed every sinner here
[1:03:10] is already
[1:03:12] saved for it was finished at
[1:03:16] Calvary the atonement was made healing
[1:03:20] and
[1:03:22] salvation this is a better atonement
[1:03:24] than the old one was because you could
[1:03:26] go in sin come up and offer an atonement
[1:03:28] and go right back in
[1:03:30] sin come back and over another and go
[1:03:32] back it never could do away with that
[1:03:35] desire but this atonement can not only
[1:03:38] take away the sin it'll take the very
[1:03:40] root cause of it away it'll take it all
[1:03:43] away the Bible said he was wounded for
[1:03:46] our transgression and with his stripes
[1:03:48] we were healed he said now someone tried
[1:03:50] to speak and say this fulfilled in
[1:03:52] Matthew 12 when he said he looked upon
[1:03:53] them and with the infirmities of us and
[1:03:55] he healed that it might be fulfilled
[1:03:57] with the spoken by Isaiah the prophet he
[1:03:58] bore our infirmities that was a year and
[1:04:00] 6 months before the atonement was ever
[1:04:02] made then if that be true where were
[1:04:05] many where were many trying to argue
[1:04:07] against Divine Healing then the
[1:04:09] atonement had more power before it
[1:04:12] became in force then it did after it
[1:04:15] came in force he said the church gave
[1:04:18] his the Christ gave his church whether
[1:04:19] it's called Methodist Baptist
[1:04:21] Presbyterian Catholic Pentecost whatever
[1:04:22] it is he gave them power to heal the
[1:04:25] sick he said now I'm asking for any man
[1:04:27] any student any Bible student or
[1:04:29] historian to produce to me one piece of
[1:04:31] scripture where Jesus has taking that
[1:04:34] power from the
[1:04:35] church and told them they didn't have it
[1:04:39] anymore come on somebody he never took
[1:04:43] power from the church but the problem is
[1:04:45] the church is afraid to exercise or to
[1:04:49] practice what Christ told them to
[1:04:51] do now to the critic a few years ago you
[1:04:54] can make remark but now we have tens and
[1:04:57] thousands of documented statements by
[1:04:59] doctors and Clinics and hospitals
[1:05:01] everywhere across the world and
[1:05:02] absolutely outstanding miracles of the
[1:05:04] Blind and the deaf and the dumb raising
[1:05:07] from the dead when doctors pronounce him
[1:05:09] dead documented statements the
[1:05:10] unbelievers mouth is hush you don't hear
[1:05:13] much of it
[1:05:14] anymore but it's come
[1:05:17] back oh it's come
[1:05:21] back that doesn't belong just to
[1:05:23] Pentecostal people that doesn't belong
[1:05:25] just to any certain group or certain man
[1:05:27] or evangelist come by like myself or Mr
[1:05:29] Roberts or some other man that's to
[1:05:32] every
[1:05:37] believer we got how many Believers we
[1:05:39] got here that's to every believer not
[1:05:43] only to the pastor but also to the
[1:05:46] leoty to any man or woman that's born of
[1:05:49] the spirit of God that's got faith in
[1:05:52] his healing has a right to pray for the
[1:05:54] sick just with the same results that any
[1:05:57] other man would
[1:05:59] have come on
[1:06:02] somebody said maybe tonight you'll
[1:06:04] accept salvation but that's already been
[1:06:07] paid for the debt has been
[1:06:11] cleared oh praise the Lord I'm thankful
[1:06:14] for his debt clearing
[1:06:20] abilities it took a lot of
[1:06:24] blood to clear a
[1:06:28] debt whole animal would die blood
[1:06:32] everywhere for one
[1:06:39] man but now one man blood paid the debt
[1:06:44] for whosoever will let him
[1:06:48] come one man's body dying upon the cross
[1:06:53] and he would scream these words it it is
[1:06:58] finished maybe the devil didn't realize
[1:07:00] what had happened when those three words
[1:07:01] come out but he figured it out really
[1:07:05] quick all of a sudden he
[1:07:07] realized when that Holy Spirit came back
[1:07:10] into
[1:07:11] Peter and the other disciples and those
[1:07:14] 120 that was in the upper room he could
[1:07:16] come and tempt
[1:07:18] them he would try to make Peter deny
[1:07:20] again no doubt he would try to make him
[1:07:23] curse again no doubt but something it
[1:07:27] happened all of a sudden he realized
[1:07:30] this power that was in one man well I
[1:07:32] couldn't make that one man sin I
[1:07:34] couldn't make that one man do it down
[1:07:36] and go the way of unbelievers and
[1:07:38] Sinners and do I now I have not just one
[1:07:42] man I got
[1:07:46] 120 that's what the Holy Ghost is it's
[1:07:49] not some
[1:07:50] wimy social power Social Gospel Power
[1:07:53] that's in you one day and gone the next
[1:07:56] and you can be up one day and down the
[1:07:57] next you can be a Sav one day and a
[1:07:59] sinner the next that's not the Holy
[1:08:02] Ghost oh no no no that is not the Holy
[1:08:05] Ghost the Holy Ghost is the same life
[1:08:07] that was in Jesus
[1:08:09] Christ and that same life when it comes
[1:08:11] inside of you it gives you overcoming
[1:08:15] power that does not mean that when
[1:08:17] something comes by you don't see it and
[1:08:19] all of a sudden a thought may come but
[1:08:20] it'll give you a power to take that
[1:08:22] thought subject to the word of God and
[1:08:24] turn that head and walk forward that
[1:08:27] exactly what the gospel would do the
[1:08:30] power of Christ is not some weak spirit
[1:08:33] that just comes and goes and has no
[1:08:35] ability but that
[1:08:38] power it raised you up from the dead you
[1:08:41] are dead in sins and trespasses and it
[1:08:44] gave you a Life to Live just as Jesus
[1:08:47] Christ
[1:08:53] lived yeah where you what do you
[1:08:56] mean you was in a he said the devil had
[1:08:59] put you in a pawn shop but Jesus came
[1:09:02] and he paid the price and he redeemed
[1:09:05] you and the only thing you have to do is
[1:09:08] walk out and claim your
[1:09:17] Liberty now I could have a a cashier's
[1:09:21] check laying here
[1:09:22] with somebody's name on it
[1:09:26] unless that somebody believed it was
[1:09:28] their
[1:09:31] name and got
[1:09:34] up and came up here and said yep that's
[1:09:36] my
[1:09:37] name yep I believe that's a real
[1:09:41] bank and they would take it to the bank
[1:09:44] and they would deposit it it took a lot
[1:09:46] of faith cuz there're there there scams
[1:09:49] out there there's
[1:09:52] fakes but if they truly believed it they
[1:09:54] would take it to the bank and they' get
[1:09:57] it certified yep there's funds there and
[1:09:59] yep it's got your name on it it's yours
[1:10:03] but what if they never came up to get it
[1:10:06] what if they never made a move well I
[1:10:07] just that's probably somebody else's
[1:10:09] name on that thing and if I get up there
[1:10:12] and has got my name probably some scam
[1:10:17] anyhow you that's how the devil's tried
[1:10:19] to train is real good you know in the
[1:10:20] age age that we live in there's scams
[1:10:23] everywhere and he wants to bring it
[1:10:24] right in into our
[1:10:26] beliefs that we can't believe in what
[1:10:29] God has already done but if somebody had
[1:10:31] the faith to believe and I got I'm
[1:10:34] talking about more than a million
[1:10:36] billion trillion bucks laying up here in
[1:10:38] a cashier check I'm talking about
[1:10:40] eternal
[1:10:43] life if you can truly believe that it's
[1:10:46] for
[1:10:47] real that worth having that is something
[1:10:51] worth trading what I got for then you'll
[1:10:54] make a move
[1:10:56] then there'll be something a deep that
[1:10:57] calleth to the Deep there'll be a
[1:10:59] response there'll be something moving
[1:11:01] towards that Amen to put it to cash it
[1:11:04] and to bring it to pass amen he said he
[1:11:06] walked in and he paid for the price and
[1:11:08] he he said but you have to do what you
[1:11:11] have to do is walk out and claim your
[1:11:12] Liberty you have a receip from God that
[1:11:15] the debt is
[1:11:17] paid you have a receed from God that the
[1:11:20] debt is paid Jesus said it in his last
[1:11:23] words it is finished every Redemptive
[1:11:26] blessing was paid for God's Great wrath
[1:11:29] on sin when it became sin for us the
[1:11:31] debt was settled so therefore Satan has
[1:11:35] no more power over

[1:11:42] bluff and if he can just Bluff you into
[1:11:45] it he you'll have to have it but legally

[1:13:16] lie that with God there's no such a
[1:13:18] thing as an incurable
[1:13:21] disease we there's a young lady up there
[1:13:24] in in British Columbia y'all know her
[1:13:26] name she rewrote the

[1:14:16] zero but God says let me step into the
[1:14:20] situation and I'll change your body just
[1:14:22] like I changed Sarah
[1:14:26] come on somebody I'll change it in a
[1:14:28] moment a twinkling of eye and it'll
[1:14:30] happen just like I said it
[1:14:41] would I mean we we're looking for
[1:14:43] brother Ron to be
[1:14:46] healed some people think that's an
[1:14:48] impossible task but with my God it ain't
[1:14:53] impossible he's the god God who changed
[1:14:55] an old 90y old
[1:14:58] woman changed her from the inside to the
[1:15:01] outside from the outside to the
[1:15:04] inside amen brought her right on back to
[1:15:07] being a young woman again to where a
[1:15:09] young king would look at and wanted to
[1:15:11] be a wife it's one of the Mysteries in
[1:15:14] the
[1:15:20] Bible it's actually the Mysteries the
[1:15:23] mystery of the raptures hidden right
[1:15:24] there there mystery of the body change
[1:15:27] is hidden right there the mystery of the
[1:15:29] body change is hidden right there in
[1:15:31] Enoch because he walked with God and was
[1:15:32] not the seventh from
[1:15:38] Adam and listen as we talk about
[1:15:41] scriptures there's many scriptures that
[1:15:43] that that have dual meanings and dual
[1:15:44] purposes some have been fully fulfilled
[1:15:46] as we're speaking here it's been
[1:15:48] fulfilled it's done the debts paid but
[1:15:51] there's some scriptures that that were
[1:15:53] speaking of Jesus but also speaking of
[1:15:54] his bride there was some scripture that
[1:15:56] was speaking of you there's there's all
[1:15:58] kinds of things that are taking place
[1:15:59] the Bible is not some dead book laying
[1:16:01] on a shelf somewhere it's a living Bible
[1:16:04] still yet
[1:16:05] today there's still Sarah there's still
[1:16:08] Abraham's there's still Daniels there's
[1:16:10] still David's thank God there's still
[1:16:12] Davids a David that'll walk down the
[1:16:15] face of a giant and say you're today
[1:16:17] your head's coming off I'm not going to
[1:16:19] listen to you challenge the armies of
[1:16:21] the Living God but I know the finished
[1:16:23] work has already taking place Place
[1:16:25] therefore I'm going to stand amen I'm
[1:16:27] going to call you into the valley and
[1:16:29] I'm going to take your head
[1:16:31] off thank God there's still David and
[1:16:34] Daniel's that'll
[1:16:35] pray don't matter if they're surrounded
[1:16:38] by lines they'll still
[1:16:41] pray until God sends Angels down and God
[1:16:44] begins to move and the whole whole
[1:16:47] system that he was in amen God wants
[1:16:50] still has those kind of people
[1:16:56] but your healing and salvation is
[1:16:59] already
[1:17:02] done it's
[1:17:04] fulfilled it's finished you got to say
[1:17:08] Lord I want to appropriate the
[1:17:12] faith to believe it's already done and
[1:17:16] to put my check
[1:17:17] in he said now if something in the word
[1:17:20] can make you realize you're free by
[1:17:21] Grace or something realize the word make
[1:17:23] you understand or somebody of God that's
[1:17:25] includ that it's including you it
[1:17:27] includes all of us then we just accept
[1:17:29] it on the basis and we're free you don't
[1:17:31] have to feel any different you don't
[1:17:33] have to feel anything at all it's not
[1:17:35] based upon that Jesus never did say do
[1:17:37] you feel it he said Do you believe it
[1:17:40] it's Faith that's our fa that's our
[1:17:43] that's what it takes faith is an arm a
[1:17:45] mighty arm that holds the two edged
[1:17:47] sword of God Amen that sharp two-edged
[1:17:49] sword of his word it'll cut every
[1:17:51] Promise free if that arm of faith is
[1:17:54] able to yield that sword some people has
[1:17:56] a very weak muscle trouble and they they
[1:17:58] can maybe only cut a little scratch
[1:17:59] enough to join a
[1:18:01] church enough to sit on a Pew and occupy
[1:18:04] a spot amen but if they can just get an
[1:18:06] arm of Faith amen it'll cut to the
[1:18:09] baptism of the Holy
[1:18:10] Ghost it'll cut to every promises
[1:18:17] free Divine Healing does not lay in a
[1:18:23] man Divine he heing does not lay in
[1:18:26] William
[1:18:30] brandham Divine Healing does not lay in
[1:18:33] any man it is a finished work your faith
[1:18:36] in a finished work a gift of healing is
[1:18:39] merely a gift of faith for
[1:18:42] healing did you hear
[1:18:44] that a gift of healing is merely a gift
[1:18:48] of faith for
[1:18:50] healing so a gift of healing does not
[1:18:53] have to be even
[1:18:55] it does not even have to even be a
[1:18:57] pastor it can be a lay member yes the
[1:19:01] Ley can have this same
[1:19:06] thing hello
[1:19:09] somebody what kind of people ought we to
[1:19:11] be we ought to be people that believes
[1:19:14] that God's already paid for this so when
[1:19:16] we ask it's going to be
[1:19:21] done we pray for the sick that's part of
[1:19:23] the Gospel is our Lord Jes Jesus told us
[1:19:25] that we should go in the all World
[1:19:26] preach the gospel pray for the sick we
[1:19:28] have these nights on our along our
[1:19:30] campaigns we pray for the sick we don't
[1:19:32] claim to be a Healer we just claim that
[1:19:33] we pray for the
[1:19:35] sick I like how he puts that very simple
[1:19:38] we believe that all that God can do for
[1:19:40] you has already been purchased for you
[1:19:42] at Calvary when he died at Calvary
[1:19:44] finished the Plan of Salvation the
[1:19:45] Redemption for the soul and body and now
[1:19:47] we draw the earnest of our Salvation
[1:19:49] which is the Holy Spirit and then also
[1:19:51] we have the earnest of our resurrection
[1:19:53] that is that when our bodies are sick
[1:19:56] God is our healer and I believe that
[1:19:59] upon a finished work that was completed
[1:20:01] us for us at Calvary some 1900 years ago
[1:20:04] when Christ died for us to redeem us
[1:20:06] from all these things I do not believe
[1:20:08] that there's anyone that can forgive
[1:20:09] sins unless it's a sin maybe against
[1:20:11] them if you sin against me then I ask me
[1:20:14] for forgiveness I could do that would do
[1:20:15] that but I believe that sins that would
[1:20:18] be committed against God that God is the
[1:20:20] only one that can forgive those sins I
[1:20:22] believe that Divine Healing is based
[1:20:24] upon own faith we believe that he was
[1:20:26] wounded for our transgression and with
[1:20:28] his stripes we were healed you notice
[1:20:30] the Peter the Apostle Peter places it in
[1:20:33] past tense it's past tense just like
[1:20:37] salvation when Jesus died at Calvary he
[1:20:40] saved the whole world every human being
[1:20:42] ever be would be on the earth a sin
[1:20:44] question could be settled once and for
[1:20:46] all when Jesus
[1:20:50] died but you'll never be a beneficiary
[1:20:55] of that
[1:20:56] policy unless you accept
[1:21:01] it we got a if I understand right
[1:21:05] there's a website dedicated to unclaimed

[1:24:08] brother Timothy we got these in the pull
[1:24:09] pit and that woman got up in front of
[1:24:11] trump and she did I ain't even who I'm
[1:24:13] talking about I'm talking about in our
[1:24:16] ranks people that's not feel with the
[1:24:18] Holy Ghost never had an experience with
[1:24:22] God and trying to by some intellectual
[1:24:26] ability reveal something that's to be
[1:24:29] revealed
[1:24:31] spiritually and today there's some of
[1:24:33] them shipwrecks and writing books
[1:24:36] against it when they used to stand
[1:24:38] behind it and tell you how you ought to
[1:24:40] live probably was the strictest of the
[1:24:44] strict nothing but Pharisees and
[1:24:46] Sadducees that invaded message pulpits
[1:24:49] never received the spirit of
[1:24:51] Christ whed walls snakes in the
[1:24:55] grass come on somebody and now it's
[1:24:57] manifesting
[1:24:59] time we're realizing there's a lot of
[1:25:02] wolves and sheep clothing a lot of
[1:25:04] Snakes in the Grass it gets up behind a
[1:25:06] bunch of snake oil salesman It Gets
[1:25:08] behind a pull pit wants to sell you some
[1:25:10] psychology or some intellectual ability
[1:25:13] I'm not here to sell you none of that
[1:25:14] I'm here to tell you I not I got nothing
[1:25:16] for sale it's already been paid
[1:25:19] for you don't have to buy it you don't
[1:25:22] have to work for it all you got to do is
[1:25:23] believe and say it's mine because God
[1:25:26] says it's
[1:25:33] mine someone said I was healed I was
[1:25:35] saved last week brother Brandon I beg
[1:25:37] you pardon no you wasn't well I saved 10
[1:25:39] Years nope you was saved 1900 years
[1:25:43] ago when Christ settled the sin question
[1:25:46] how can you ever preach salvation for
[1:25:48] the soul without preaching Divine
[1:25:49] Healing because the sickness is the
[1:25:51] attributes of sin before we had sin we
[1:25:54] had no sickness sickness came because of
[1:25:56] sin because not something you done but
[1:25:59] something that you
[1:26:01] inherited
[1:26:03] hello I like that not something you
[1:26:06] done that's where the devil wants to
[1:26:08] take you all the time when you get sick
[1:26:11] what have you
[1:26:12] done ain't nothing youve done it's what
[1:26:14] you
[1:26:16] inherited today in the private
[1:26:18] interviews is a place where you used to
[1:26:20] see the Holy Spirit where men and women
[1:26:22] sitting here tonight that even the Holy
[1:26:23] Spirit goes Plumb back three generations
[1:26:26] brought down the people and told them
[1:26:27] their name what they did and all about
[1:26:29] it why this thing was in that person
[1:26:30] took it off of him healed and right
[1:26:32] standing in the room tell them the
[1:26:33] grandmother grandfather who they were
[1:26:35] where they came from what they did third
[1:26:37] generation they couldn't even think next
[1:26:38] Generation brought it out the next
[1:26:40] generation of course they knew he knows
[1:26:42] all things now that did not heal the
[1:26:46] person hello now that did not heal the
[1:26:50] person but it raised them to a place
[1:26:53] that they could have have faith to be
[1:26:56] healed that's the reason we do we we
[1:26:59] baptize water won't save you it's
[1:27:01] obeying the Act take communion won't
[1:27:03] save you but it's following the word
[1:27:05] beating the altar won't heal you beating
[1:27:09] the altar won't save you but you can
[1:27:11] beat the altar till you just went out of
[1:27:13] breath and died right there you'd still
[1:27:14] be unsaved as you was when you walked
[1:27:18] up every minister in here could lay
[1:27:21] hands on every sick person here and pray
[1:27:22] for them until tomorrow night and
[1:27:25] there'll never be one thing happened
[1:27:27] until you accept he's already done
[1:27:30] it so therefore it doesn't lay in
[1:27:34] ministers or in one person or in one
[1:27:37] another it lays in our own individual
[1:27:40] faith in a finished work that Christ did
[1:27:43] for us to Calvary he now is a high
[1:27:47] priest Hebrews 3 sitting at the right
[1:27:48] end of God a Almighty in heaven making
[1:27:51] intercession Upon Our confession to
[1:27:53] confess and profess same thing you
[1:27:55] profess that you believe he was wounded
[1:27:57] for
[1:27:58] you not just somebody else for you and
[1:28:01] by his stripes you were
[1:28:04] healed he's a high priest that can make
[1:28:06] intercession Upon Our confession but he
[1:28:08] can't do it until we accept it and
[1:28:11] confess it and we could go down the
[1:28:13] Altar and pray till we laid on our face
[1:28:14] and died but until we believe it until
[1:28:18] we accept his pardoning grace we're
[1:28:20] still
[1:28:22] lost no matter how loud you scream or
[1:28:24] how long you stay or how much we could
[1:28:26] do without food until but until our
[1:28:28] hearts the revelation of God's given us
[1:28:31] that Jesus Christ died for my sin and he
[1:28:34] paid my
[1:28:35] debt and now I'm free now I'm Healed I
[1:28:40] can walk away from here
[1:28:46] delivered many people say well I like to
[1:28:48] feel like like I'm Healed he didn't say
[1:28:51] do you feel
[1:28:53] it do you believe it feeling has nothing
[1:28:56] to do with
[1:29:03] it he said he he ascended I don't I got
[1:29:06] it here somewhere but for sake of time
[1:29:09] he ascended on
[1:29:10] high and he said he sat down by the
[1:29:13] right hand of him he said no man sits
[1:29:17] down until the work is
[1:29:23] finished when when Samuel went in to
[1:29:25] find to anoint a king in Jesse's house
[1:29:28] Jesse brought all of his
[1:29:30] sons and not one of them was accepted
[1:29:33] and he said
[1:29:34] well Lord told me to come here do you
[1:29:37] not have another son he said well yeah I
[1:29:39] got this got this little guy out there
[1:29:41] in the desert he's watching some sheep
[1:29:43] and well go get him and we not sit
[1:29:47] down until he
[1:29:50] comes amen because his work was not
[1:29:52] finished
[1:29:54] but he has ascended and sat
[1:29:59] down he is signifying it is finished
[1:30:03] when the angel rolled away the stone he
[1:30:05] sat down upon the
[1:30:07] stone signifying it is finished it is
[1:30:11] done it is over with amen sin is over
[1:30:15] with diseases are over with their power
[1:30:19] over man is
[1:30:22] finished he was wounded for our
[1:30:25] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:30:28] iniquity well I wish Christ was here
[1:30:30] tonight Christ would heal me he would
[1:30:33] tell you I've already done
[1:30:35] it save me Lord Jesus I've already done
[1:30:38] it he died at Calvary every sin that was
[1:30:41] ever committed was forgiven right there
[1:30:43] on the basis of the shed blood but it'll
[1:30:47] never do you no good to accept it it's
[1:30:49] got to be your personal property
[1:30:54] and that's your personal faith in a
[1:30:55] finished work that Christ has already
[1:30:57] done it for you salvation is not doing a
[1:31:00] lot of good
[1:31:02] works no Grace is what brings us to God
[1:31:06] gra God Saves Us by
[1:31:09] Grace people get this idea well I'm not
[1:31:11] going to go to church till I get my life
[1:31:13] right well you're not going to get your
[1:31:14] life right until you go to
[1:31:17] church it's an excuse It's a carrot out
[1:31:19] on a stick that Satan wants to put out
[1:31:21] there in front of people and they go
[1:31:22] from one bar room to another Ballroom
[1:31:24] waiting to get their life right it's not
[1:31:26] going to happen you get your life right
[1:31:29] by coming and hearing the word of God
[1:31:31] and by the washing of the water of the
[1:31:33] word things begin to fall off your life
[1:31:36] and chains begin to fall off situations
[1:31:38] begin to move things begin to change all
[1:31:40] of a sudden you begin to get a glimpse
[1:31:42] of
[1:31:43] Freedom you'll never get a glimpse of
[1:31:45] Freedom out there in the Devil's
[1:31:47] Playground but in this place here when
[1:31:49] the anointing of God can come upon you
[1:31:52] and the and the mighty angels can
[1:31:54] surround you and it can pull that Black
[1:31:56] Sheath that's over you off your eyes
[1:31:58] then you can get a glimpse of Freedom
[1:32:00] then you can realize hey I wasn't born
[1:32:02] for this I was born for another
[1:32:14] place salvation isn't doing a lot of
[1:32:17] good
[1:32:19] works Grace brings us to God God Saves
[1:32:22] Us by Grace no man ever sought God at
[1:32:25] any time that's
[1:32:29] right you say well why I sought God all
[1:32:31] night no you didn't ever God sought
[1:32:35] you he was chasing after a
[1:32:41] rebel oh
[1:32:44] God it was God seeking after you it was
[1:32:48] God pulling you well I think I'll just
[1:32:52] go to church well you're not doing that
[1:32:53] on on your own it's the pulling power I
[1:32:57] will draw all men n unto
[1:33:01] me why I sought God all night you never
[1:33:04] God sought you the man's very nature in
[1:33:07] the Garden of Eden proved it instead of
[1:33:10] Abra Adam running up and down the garden
[1:33:12] saying oh Father where are th I've
[1:33:14] seeing I've seing it was God hunting
[1:33:17] Adam saying Adam Where Art
[1:33:21] Thou he said so let's turn the picture
[1:33:23] around John 6:44 here this will settle
[1:33:25] it for you if there's a question in your
[1:33:27] mind Jesus said no man can come to me
[1:33:30] except my father draw him
[1:33:34] first that settles it he if he said it
[1:33:37] all right we're not on that subject
[1:33:39] we're just background but get the fear
[1:33:41] away from you don't be scared that God's
[1:33:44] not going to answer your
[1:33:47] prayer come on somebody don't be scared
[1:33:51] that God's not going to answer your
[1:33:52] prayer go God always answers
[1:33:56] prayer the work's already finished he's
[1:33:59] obligated he must do it he's got to keep
[1:34:02] his word or he's not God it is a
[1:34:05] finished
[1:34:07] work I'm here tonight to declare every
[1:34:10] disease in this building is
[1:34:13] finished every sin in this building is
[1:34:16] finished everything the devil has tried
[1:34:19] to put on you it's
[1:34:22] finished not because I I say it's
[1:34:24] finished it's finished because he said
[1:34:26] it and if he said it I believe it and if
[1:34:30] he said it it's already
[1:34:37] done we bring this down you remember the
[1:34:40] building or the bridge that that they
[1:34:43] wanted to build they had to find the
[1:34:45] right
[1:34:46] architect and he would base his
[1:34:48] reputation upon
[1:34:50] it and he finished the job he tested at
[1:34:53] every Avenue he could test every every
[1:34:56] boat every structure everything that way
[1:34:59] if fire Struck it or weather Struck it
[1:35:00] or salt Struck it how much it would
[1:35:02] expand how much it would he tested
[1:35:05] everything and he said that's the way
[1:35:08] God did when he made this salvation
[1:35:10] bridge for us to cross from Earth to
[1:35:14] Glory he tested
[1:35:17] everything every servant that comes to
[1:35:19] him must be time tested and proven every
[1:35:21] son that cometh to God must be first
[1:35:23] tried of God God tested child trained
[1:35:25] and brought into Christ must be first
[1:35:27] tried the prophets first tried if a
[1:35:29] prophet speaks something that he that
[1:35:31] what he says not come to pass don't hear
[1:35:32] him it was a Tim tested
[1:35:35] thing and if that man building that
[1:35:38] bridge some time tested he time tested
[1:35:40] everything every boat every PL every
[1:35:42] piece of Steel
[1:35:44] everything he was trying to make sure
[1:35:47] nobody would lose their life Crossing
[1:35:51] it and he said you know he dug those
[1:35:54] holes so deep he did everything just
[1:35:56] exactly perfect but it came to the point
[1:35:58] that it's
[1:36:00] finished and he said this man had enough
[1:36:03] confidence in that testing that he
[1:36:06] didn't send somebody else across it
[1:36:08] first he didn't check you know a couple
[1:36:10] of slums on the couple uh you know guys
[1:36:13] on the street or Beggars on the street I
[1:36:16] want y'all come on I got a little job
[1:36:18] you give you 10
[1:36:19] bucks go across that bridge no no he
[1:36:23] lined it all
[1:36:29] up kind of brings a funny thing that I
[1:36:31] was just watching in in
[1:36:33] history when when Carnegie the man who
[1:36:36] come come along with the steel industry
[1:36:38] he wanted to connect the West with the
[1:36:40] East and he built the first Bridge
[1:36:42] across the Mississippi River and it had
[1:36:44] to be built in such a way that the boats
[1:36:45] could still go up and down it and it was
[1:36:48] a blockade for a long time you can go
[1:36:49] across on a raft but to get the the
[1:36:52] amount of cargo things that was needed
[1:36:54] it wasn't possible so he he was he found
[1:36:57] out how to make
[1:36:58] steel but everything that time was built
[1:37:00] out of iron and he was everything was
[1:37:02] believed in iron iron this iron that but
[1:37:04] here he come moving making carbon and
[1:37:07] iron and making steel and here he built
[1:37:09] this bridge out of steel spent billions
[1:37:11] of
[1:37:11] dollars but now it's time to test it you
[1:37:15] know what you know what he got to test
[1:37:16] that bridge you can tell he wasn't
[1:37:18] confident in his work there was a fable
[1:37:21] or a thought on that day that elephant
[1:37:23] would not cross anything that was not
[1:37:26] stable and so he gets this Big C
[1:37:28] basically a big circus act and he gets
[1:37:30] this elephant and he takes that elephant
[1:37:32] first across that bridge and what cause
[1:37:34] an elephant across that bridge everybody
[1:37:36] else
[1:37:39] would a lot of
[1:37:41] confidence in a dumb animal but here
[1:37:45] this man he didn't try to Elephant he
[1:37:47] didn't try he crossed it
[1:37:49] himself and he said see God did that
[1:37:52] between the old old New Testament he
[1:37:54] spanned his Plan of Salvation he hosted
[1:37:56] up an inside on go gol's Hill no other
[1:37:59] than the Son of God to join man and God
[1:38:00] it's time tested he tested it through
[1:38:03] Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph David on down
[1:38:05] until the perfect seed come that would
[1:38:07] stand in the middle and hold Center on
[1:38:09] either hand on one end and God on the
[1:38:11] other and bridged the way every word
[1:38:14] that he spoke every word that was placed
[1:38:15] in the Bible was time tested by the Holy
[1:38:18] Ghost therefore I believe in every
[1:38:21] Timber
[1:38:23] every precept of God Is Right everything
[1:38:25] that's written in the Bible I'm willing
[1:38:27] to lay my life down on it I may not have
[1:38:29] enough faith enough to make every
[1:38:31] promise come true but it'll never stand
[1:38:33] but I'll never stand in someone else's
[1:38:35] way who has Faith to make it come to
[1:38:37] pass if I can't walk where he didn't
[1:38:39] walk one of these days and went home
[1:38:40] without dying I won't stand some in
[1:38:43] somebody else's way that can walk in
[1:38:44] that way any walk why it's time tested I
[1:38:48] believe that every word of God is pure
[1:38:50] and unadulterated for God is putting his
[1:38:52] timber in and right because he is
[1:38:54] positive that his reputation of a savior
[1:38:58] will not be
[1:39:01] spoiled he will come to pass he will
[1:39:04] bring all of his children across that
[1:39:11] line that day come together both ends
[1:39:13] was
[1:39:14] joined because the man had done all he
[1:39:16] could do with the reputation he had he
[1:39:18] had planned it perfectly till both ends
[1:39:20] come together perfect as it could be how
[1:39:23] the people screamed and shouted when
[1:39:25] they knew the job was done and how the
[1:39:27] people today who's lost and undone
[1:39:29] without Christ how we can rejoice and
[1:39:31] praise God that the
[1:39:33] expansion was met right when God sent
[1:39:36] Jesus to the Earth and he died at
[1:39:38] Calvary to bridge the way for sinful men
[1:39:42] and women to meet their redeemer and
[1:39:43] their maker and none other than this
[1:39:45] bridge none other is this bridge but God
[1:39:48] Almighty himself his word is in him he
[1:39:50] laid his own life down he walked over
[1:39:53] him into glory and we so we could walk
[1:39:55] over him to Glory one of the bridge was
[1:39:57] nothing else but Emanuel God With Us on
[1:39:59] the other hand of the bridge is a
[1:40:01] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ who stands
[1:40:03] in the power and glory of the Father the
