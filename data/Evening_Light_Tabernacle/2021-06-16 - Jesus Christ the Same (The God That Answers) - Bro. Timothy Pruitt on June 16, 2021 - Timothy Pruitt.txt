every mind lord fill every place we ask it in jesus name amen amen let's turn the bibles to hebrews chapter 13. also first kings 18 amen it's good to be in the house of the lord i'm glad to be in the house of the lord amen with his people and his presence i know god has something really wonderful in store for us tonight hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8. jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever also first kings 18 and verse 21 and elijah came into all the people and said how long halt you between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but of baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord but bell's prophets are 450 men let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one bullet for themselves cut it in pieces lay it on the wood put no fire under it and i would dress the other bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under it and call you on the name of your gods and i will call on the name of the lord and the god that answered by fire let him be god and all the people answered and said it is well spoken down to verse 36 and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou has turned their heart back again then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench when all the people saw it they fell on their face and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god amen we'll let you be seated this evening i had something very wonderful happened today as i was doing some preparation and and getting some news about my mom and things that were going on and her her body and and the night that they had had in the situation that went on that uh it wasn't able to get much rest and so you know waking up to those that news i went in there and we gathered together with sister ruth and we got on our knees and began to pray and the lord just come down in a real special way and and minister to our hearts and i got back up and i went to my chair and i went to actually begin to send out a text for prayer from the different minister brothers minister friends and just asking god just to call on god on the scene because i for one know god answers prayer and i was reminded of another situation that it happened about i think it's been about eight seven eight years ago if i remember correctly sister adriana was out at the state park and and uh we was enjoying a little time together with some young people out there and i had actually been at home you know remember the story but i'll go through it again for a moment i'd actually been at at home studying for the sunday night service and i was going to preach on a god we could rely on and uh and but just things wasn't really coming together so i told sister ruth i said let's go get some hamburger and let's take it out there to where they're playing that frisbee golf and cook some hamburgers and so we went out there and just as i was cooking some hamburgers here comes adriana down on a ripstick and and the story is you know as she went down she couldn't make the curve because she was going too fast and we went back later she come to the end of the the uh the pavement there she went to a complete stop is that that rip stick would go off the pavement hit the dirt and she went flipping and hit her head up against her still post and we rushed down to where she was at we later went back and measured she went about 25 30 feet down through there flipping through the air and so i got down to her to her side and she was laid up against that post and her head was swollen out there at her temple and uh she was kind of making a groaning sound and i rolled her onto her back real easy as trying to make sure airways was open and and began to talk to her and i was just saying adriana i want you to talk to daddy and she was just making some some kind of groaning sounds and and so she opened her eyes for a minute and her eyes was kind of moving around in weird uh directions and and was pretty much crossed so i bowed my head and i just said lord you know we're here to enjoy a good time with some young people and we're not out here for the wrong reason we're out here in nature and i know that you're here with us and i can declare that and i'm asking that you would come as you did there's brother brandon was out there in nature and his friend was bit with a snake and he prayed and the very effect of that snake was was moved away in a very short time to where he'd go back fishing again and and i said you're that same god today and i need that same god and i watched as those eyes came straight came just perfectly straight and she would say her first words to me and she'd say daddy i i can't see you and i'd bow my head again and i'd say lord i i seen you take these eyes and bring them straight now give them sight and her words would turn to daddy i see you now and i saw god answer very quickly as she would be in him state of amnesia and dirty all over and from the fall and the things that went over and she couldn't remember anything that happened that day she couldn't remember anything that had went on and at all and and uh but just very quickly we called the ambulance and and brother matthew similarly i believe was there and he called brother tim and told him what was going on and the tim would pray and that they would be not one broke bone in her body and and uh so the ambulance took about 20 minutes to get there and as they began to load her up you could tell her mind began to fire she began to remember all the things that had taken place so in very just a short time we seen god turn around a real bad situation and make it for our good and and so they loaded up sister ruth got in the ambulance with her and and they went to the toward the hospital and some of the other brothers brother james lay and their family was there i believe if i remember right and they took some of the rest of the children and and i went in the van following the ambulance and called my father and told him where i was going he said i'll meet you in homework or was going through homer to go to mendon and i put the phone down and i i began to praise the lord and begin to thank him and i was weeping and i was crying and and just i don't really know how i made it to homer to be honest with you but i just thanking the lord for the thing his mercy and his grace and i heard my voice speak and i heard it say what you have seen in the natural you'll also see in the supernatural and we saw god and i got up sunday night and i i actually testified to that and we saw god very quickly move on the scene and now brother philip is here tonight because of that very that very situation that i was going through god would put on my heart to speak identity crisis and i'd preach it that wednesday night and not knowing that that week god really began to deal on his heart to come back to god and if it wasn't the very same thing a man who had went through a bad uh down the wrong path and found himself in a wrecked condition and found himself with spiritual amnesia forgetting who he is but god very quickly bringing him back to who he really was and god did it in a supernatural way and so today you know as i was i was i was praying about that i i got up to go to the restroom and as i was walking through my bedroom i was weeping and crying asking god to move on this situation and as i was walking through there i heard my voice speak amen i heard my voice speak and he said did not give you your sermon already on friday before you ever went through this jesus christ the same the god who answers and i'm looking for his answer and we're here together as believers to see a god who answers by fire a god who can take a moment and change the whole situation he's already done it so many times we've seen him move in so many ways that he is a god who answers he is a god who hears our cry he is a god who hears our prayers amen we would we would look at this and we would we would see brother branham talk about prayer and he talked about prayer is a key and the it's the answer prayer changes things prayer changes things as you would actually hear elijah he prayed now god i've done what you've said i've done what you've instructed now i'm looking for you to move and god answered his prayer amen it was his prayer and he said the prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in control of human beings there is no atomic bomb there is no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer can even change the mind of god it did that before amen and i believe prayer is powerful tonight and i i believe that prayer has been lifted up on the behalf of many needs now we got more needs and sister karen we got here tonight that needs a touch from god but we also have brother aaron that's on a trip right now but he's been suffering in his body we have brother ron that's been fighting this battle of cancer we have many other needs in our body we have needs for uh of the baron to give life a manchester candace and sister esther and you know and as i was speaking yesterday to brother michael dexter and as they're streaming as i understand even now he said you know i just felt in my heart he said i feel that same motion that same way that and i told bethany i said this is the week for miracles and i believe we ought to get ready to receive them [Music] amen it's not just an empty phrase it's not just an empty word or i hope so or it may be because i'm going to tell you when i heard my voice speak that every fear every anxiety every worry it left and i'm no longer looking at the situation or the circumstances i'm looking at a promise and his promises thus saith the lord by his stripes she's healed hallelujah you know as we would look here in matthew chapter 7 ask and it shall be given how many can say shall be given ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you and for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth now he couldn't put this in his words if he wasn't still the same god if he wasn't the god who would answer who would give the answer that we are desiring and to him that knocketh it shall be opened or what man is there of you whom if his son asks bread would he give him a stone or if he ask a fish would he give him a serpent if ye then be an evil know how much good how good gifts to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask of him hallelujah he's a amen he's a god who answers he answered in every situation through the old testament and he answered in the situations in the new testament he answered just in these in this generation that we have lived in and he's still the same today as he ever was and he's going to answer our prayers he's going to answer there's not one unanswered prayer i know they made a country song out of that thank god for unanswered prayers but there's no such a thing as an unanswered prayer god answers every prayer now they may be answered in a certain time as we know in the book of revelations they will pour out those vials which are the prayers of the saints that couldn't be answered in that time but those prayers will be answered oh hallelujah god always answers jesus said we would otherwise he would not say ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find everyone that asks will receive everyone that seeks will find everyone that knocks it will be open unto him that's the only way he said i've ever found it that to get anything from god is to take his word and believe it and stand upon it and not let it go amen god will always answer and i want to give fair warning to the devil you know i got to i was talking about the andrew you know this week and i with andrew spencer and and and he was it was sharing our hearts and things because you know let me let me let you in on something that's what's going on here the devil hates the supernatural the supernatural of god he knows when the supernatural happens every time he is defeated and so anyone who stands for the supernatural who preaches the supernatural they're going to come under the attack of satan and this is exactly what has happened the satan has tried to as we heard sunday he's standing upon it writing saying you can't have it saying it ain't possible healings for another day this is for another time it's impossible but we're not going to back off from his writing we're going to stand with not empty words we're going to stand with thus saith the lord and stand there and god will answer with fire hallelujah as i was talking to him i said brother andrew i'm reminded of world war ii amen when there was a group of men that decided it was a good idea to go across the pacific ocean and they would take some bombs and they would bomb pearl harbor and they and they would they would pretty much lay it to waste and they would destroy planes and destroy buildings and destroy ships and they'd been having their way through the pacific and they've been taking this island and that island and attacking this one over here and attacking but they made the wrong choice it's history they made the wrong choice matter of fact when they when they finished there they began to turn back towards japan and their one of their generals said you know i'm afraid we have awakened a sleeping giant amen and what ended up happening in that war that was the only nation in history that the atomic bomb has been dropped on not once but twice i know it wasn't a wonderful thing and it's not something really to celebrate but that's what exactly happened amen it was war and i'm here tonight to declare war on the sea on satan he has come he has attacked the body of jesus christ he is attacked he has made his threats he has made us boast but we're not going to back down to that we're going to stand there and we have more than our words we have more than our own ideas we have the atomic the nuclear weapon the word of god that's here thus saith the lord that will disintegrate satan's kingdom listen this god is a god of preparation he has been preparing us for this moment when he spoke to me on friday about this service and we started saturday having to take her to the hospital i figured sunday i would be preaching but god has prepared us for this moment for this time to show you i am the god who answers by fire i am the god who healeth me i am the god who saveth it i am the god who's not deaf and gone on a vacation somewhere but i've heard your cry your prayer i've heard your cry and i have come down to deliver you hallelujah amen we have this amen it's something we can stand on and many times you may not even know satan's coming i mean you know he's here but you don't know when his attack's going to be right you don't know when it's going to happen so many times pretty much all the time sometimes we're just taking unawares we wasn't expecting it at that moment or at that time i thought it was very interesting this is very interesting today as i was driving to church this was pretty much an unexpected attack that we've been under and i'm driving and i'm thinking and praying also down to the side of my vision i see this snake come out on the road had come out on the road and i splattered him i looked over sister ruth and said well i didn't even see him coming but i still ran over him she looked at me and she said apparently he didn't see you coming either hallelujah i want to on the devil one more time i may not have seen you coming but you're about to get your hide run over because it's not my battle this is the lord's battle it's not my war this is god's battle and apparently you don't know who you're messing with but you're messing with a son of god blood bought and not just a son many sons many daughters amen we ought to be just like those american soldiers when pearl harbor was attacked they began to take the attack back to the enemy and they began to move on this island it wasn't even their land wasn't even their people it wasn't even their kindred but it was but they we had such a passion let's drive the enemy back let's drive the enemy back tonight we ought to have a passion because it is our brother it is our land it is what god has given us there ought to be a cry in our heart he attacked one of us he attacked all of us he attacks one message church he attacked every message church hallelujah said brother and i'm talking about in moses he said moses was 80 years old he said you would might you might think he was too old for god to deal with yeah he was an old man unexpected in his age to be dealt with with god he was in an unexpected place he said but god met him at an unexpected age and an unexpected place in an unexpected way god didn't meet moses the way he usually met men he met moses in an unusual way and the way he choosed them chose to meet moses and that's the way he answers our prayer in the way he thinks best in the his way is always right if we ask for anything and it doesn't happen just the way we think it that god ought to have let it happen then it might don't let it make us lose and fall back let's ask god stand firm on the word and say it's true and receive it when he sends it that's the way you got to believe god it may come disguised it may come away you're not expected but no matter which way it comes we have asked and we shall receive god said so and it settles it forever now what if moses said what said well i pray for god to make me a military man and here he comes in the burning bush don't make any difference how god appeared just so he appeared hallelujah and to be honest it don't matter how he does it just so he does it and he's going to do it that's all that matters as long as god comes and answers and he will oh my jacob was caught between two occasions he'd done some shady things some mean things little tricks to his father-in-law and he was running from him and going back home to mama and then his brother who had done some dirty tricks too you know your sins will find you out but oh jacob he got all disturbed and perplexed and troubled and he set his wives across the little brook went to the other side in an unexpected place in an unexpected time he met god in an unexpected way what a way to meet god in a wrestling match amen but it was god regardless if he's in a burning bush or a wrestling match it was god oh my the main thing he came out different and he came out with the blessing and he held on to it oh if we could do that if we could find a spot to where we can see god whether it's in his word whether wherever it may be we recognize that was god and you wrestle it out god promised he would do it he promised me if i would seek him i would find him he promised me if i would ask it would be given and you're wrestling it out if he promised me if i would not it would be open and i know his word is true you stand there and hold him don't let him go and see that it's god and he wouldn't turn it loose and neither should you [Music] we're not turning it loose he said if you can lay hold your hand on something that's real catch a vision of the un uh the omnipotent god and see his presence and hold on to it till god sends the answer back and the blessing he said my what happened when you can see the power of a living god something real no matter what form he comes in oh we might have our own ideas but god has a way of sending things to us answering our prayers he said i believe if we could just open our eyes and be ready to send it god is ready to send it tonight well i got a few amens off of that amen he said i believe if we would just open our eyes how many got your eyes open that's not what i'm talking about your supernatural eyes to realize hey we might be surrounded but i'm surrounded by him there's more force than there is against us there's angels of fire lying in this building there's walking down these aisles each and every aisle there's angels with swords drawn these ain't passive angels these are angels waiting for war they're ready for battle they've come to do business with the devil [Applause] he held on to it we could speak of the children of israel the three hebrew children been carried away captive down in babylon they come to the trial it was the darkest trial of their life you will always have trials before you have a victory if there's no war there is no victory the hebrew children down there have been brought on us to a spot and we feel like we've been brought to a spot but i want you to understand it might look terrible it might look bad but it's the right spot because it happens to be in this spot that's where god answers hallelujah the chief three of her children were brought to a spot where the king had made a declaration and was making his boats and and that this daring anybody not to bow or they're going to be thrown in the fire but they purpose in their heart we're not going to do what that king says but where instead we're going to do what our god decrees and they held on to it what's the first thing you ought to turn to what should be your refuge when a trial comes the greatest weapon that's ever been put in the hands of mankind prayer it changes everything god let that soak into our hearts it changes everything it even changed the mind of god when he told a prophet go tell the king he's going to die and that king turned to the wall and said lord i beseech you to consider me i walk before you with a perfect heart i need 15 years longer and god's spared his life prayer changes things oh my we notice that these three hebrew children had come to a time they said we want a prayer meeting what we going to do a decision had to be made no doubt they prayed all night long no they doubt they prayed and they asked time after time and they were had to decide what are we going to do are we going to turn and bow are we going to just back off the promises of god are we going to just say well he didn't really mean it that way i'm sorry and we just back off no we're not backing off we're not turning around amen i've come to a decision amen god is going to answer by fire god is going to move amen you have to make that decision regardless of what taking place regardless of what who's turned around who's leaving who's saying this who's saying that i don't care who goes away i'm standing on the word of god and i'm not backing up from it i'm standing on it regardless of what takes place hallelujah so we're going to throw you in the fiery furnace we're going to turn it up hotter not bowing we're going to make it worse not bowing we're going to make the symptoms worse not bowing we're going to make you feel worse not bowing we're going to make you give up not bowing we're going to make you say god don't do that no more not bowing we're going to make you say that the supernatural don't happen no more not bowing we're going to make you say that amen healings ain't ain't the body no more not bowing we're going to make you say cancer is going to overcome not bowing we're going to make you say blame brain bleeds it's going to be your demise we're not bowing i don't know you make your threats o king oh you want to but i want you to understand you're not the king you are a king there is the king and the king is in the house and when he's in the house everything is made right hallelujah i'm here to tell you it ain't worth it it's more than just angels even here now god is moving into his word and he's saying yes hold on i'm gonna make your children worse not bowing i'm gonna make more leave not barreling i'm gonna make all kind of people turn against you not bowing i'm gonna make your depression worse not bowing i'm gonna make your anxiety worse not bowing i'm gonna make your pain worse not bowing i'm gonna make you barren last a little longer not bowing i'm standing on the word of god and his word says it is the saith the lord we have made up our minds if you ain't made up your mind make it up or get out amen but you want to be an opinion we want to be a people in one mind in one accord that the supernatural can visit us that's a there's no hindrances we're living in the days of ananias and sapphira sin is not going to be able to stay here no longer things that your lackadaisical attitudes ain't there there's no more time for that it's either make up your mind who you'll serve this day if they'll be god serve him but if god be god serve him and if you're going to serve him serve him with all your heart serve him in the music serve them in the worship serve them in your prayers serve them in your life serve them in the morning serving a new time saving all day long hallelujah if god be god and i say he is god and if god is god who can be a forgiveness [Applause] he's a god who answers by fire come on amen we've seen the prophet of god who come in the elijah in this generation he came and he put the altar back in his place he put the wood back in his place all these so-called ministries had tore it all down trying to make something happen and he brought it all back together stones in their place water separation in this pla everything in this place ye whose hearts have been turned back and we saw him service after service say if i've told you the truth let him come and he came to where even his peers had to admit we've never seen nothing like this and you want to go off on some little thing that sometimes somebody says that wasn't even there make up your mind if god's big god serve him they said king live forever but our god is able he's able to deliver us from that fiery furnace he's able to do it but if he doesn't we're still not bowing we made up our minds we took the way with the lord's despised few we want to stand true to it that's what the church needs is stand true to the promise oh my he said he's obligated to his promise if god's made a promise he's obligated to it and as long as you're abraham's seed he's got to answer hello he's got to answer now don't get any doubts in your mind keep them doubts away just stay right on the cross right now look right straight to the one who made the promise i've never seen him fail yet i'm never read of him failing and you never will either because he cannot fail he's god he made the promise he made it all the way back from genesis all the way to revelations and he's not going to let one promise fall hallelujah the enemy was at the fiery furnace looked impossible look like they're coming to their last moments next morning came said you're going to bow no we're not going to bow i've had enough heated seven times harder i didn't read of anything there of shadrach meshach abednego i didn't even read of them blinking do what you got to do king i'm not buying heated it seven times hotter all the way down and walking closer the hands are bound had some strong men walking around make sure they wouldn't jump out and run and he's moving towards looks like destruction they walk right up he said you know when we come to those places sometimes we get nervous he said when somebody said why don't you just accept your healing tonight so we get nervous well tomorrow i'm still coughing my hands still crippled i don't have nothing to do with it i don't have nothing to do with it when you really honestly from the depths of your heart except that it's a finished work that christ did it's finished did you hear that it's finished you're sure you're sure it's going to be all right chad wreck yeah it's sure i'm sure even though he won't deliver if he don't deliver us god's still god they're walking hotter they could feel the skin start to get hot on their face they could feel the intense heat of the furnace and it killed those men that were around them looked like the darkest hour sometimes god would let you get there to where you can't hardly see the hand in front of your face and he moves he knows where you're standing at he knows your next step he knows exactly what the next move is he knows exactly he knows your cry before you even cry hallelujah amen he talks about he said i've seen cancer cases come to their almost their last breath instead of brother laying with arthritis recently had his hand laying real crippled up like this and his holy spirit said thus saith the lord you're healed he went home and got worse he said i can't help it that man didn't know me he never seen me in his life he'd never seen me before how how could he tell me who i was i know by the man's talk he's not educated but i know there was something a supernatural element there something happened they couldn't even move the pillow and then when they moved the pillar he just screamed out in pain but he would just keep testifying i'm healed i'm healed i'm healed she said his wife said honey i'm afraid you're a pro bringing a reproach upon the very religion we believe he said i cannot bring a reproach i believe in my heart that it'll happen it got so bad till he laid on his back and his little girl was trying to put a wet rag on his face and he felt like he's about to faint and when he did he looked up and he seen christ come before him on the cross and he said when he bowed his head and died and he thought it was his last breath going and he couldn't breathe no more and the arthritis was all through him and he went to bow his head to die he seen hit christ's head bowed down first and all of a sudden he gave a big leap and out of that chair and around around the place he went why because he kept trusting jesus let me tell you when you can't trust your friend you can trust jesus when you can't trust anything around you you can trust jesus you can trust him in your darkest days you can trust him in your longest days you can trust him no matter what situation sometimes when it'll get real dark but remember in the darkest moments jesus comes walking by i mean we can talk about mary and martha we've been on them for a little bit it was a dark moment all hope was gone it seemed helpless they'd cried they'd pray it said messenger after messenger and it just seemed like he's just walking away further but he heard their first cry and it got so dark and jesus appeared and he come they come to martha and they said martha the master has come and calleth for thee oh my i believe he's calling for every sick person here tonight i believe he's calling for every person that's bound with some spirit the master has come and he's calling for you he's the god who answers you may think that god hasn't heard your cry you may think daddy mama ain't heard it you may think that the nobody knows about it god knows about it you go down hebrew children at the last moments at their last breath we're coming to the last place the last step and it's into the fire brother branham says pardon me let's turn the camera towards heaven oh my god may the camera be refocused tonight this this evening it's been focused on your last steps and your darkness and all the things but let's turn the camera towards heaven let's turn it over toward pardon me just a minute let's turn it towards heaven it's been dark for us in these last few days and things have not been working right and things haven't been going right seemingly has been getting darker and darker and darker pardon me just a minute mom i'm going to turn the camera just a little bit and we're going to look towards heaven because i remember when heaven came down on your behalf over the germany meetings and she was battling with that that that menstrual problem and change of life and and going through all those things the elderly woman would go through and i've watched her go through that battle and i've watched her go through that battle but pardon the camera changed and he said the angel's standing by you even right now and the one who started it is going to finish it and as far as i know that word hasn't changed [Applause] or somebody ought to rejoice right now that word has not changed he's still the god who answers amen i'm sure our sister atlanta i know she had a lot of dark moments a large dark time a lot of thoughts to give it up a lot of thoughts of just saying why don't i just lay here on this couch and die and just give up but something on the inside of her kept pushing her forward said nope i'm not going to bow nope i'm going to church tonight nope i'm going to church this morning nope i'm not going to bow i'm going to sit down on my seat i'm going to listen to the word nope devil you can say what you want i'm not going to bow and all the while jesus is walking her way and she showed up on a sunday morning and jesus came in the building and he showed her i am doing some extreme things i have done so much in this generation it'll be a sin for you to disbelieve hallelujah we have seen the lame walk we have seen the blind eyes come open we have seen god moving from reckless ways and she came on that sunday morning and jesus come by her way he's a god who answers [Applause] i don't know i saw a lot of sister mariah's battle and she would battle the thoughts and and the thinking and all the things and the darkness that she was going through i wasn't as close as no doubt her mom and dad her brothers were and they would see her tears and see her cry and see all the things but there was something in her that some couldn't give up [Music] it's kind of like they went in that world war ii thing they attacked a lot of islands and took them but then they attacked the wrong people do you understand the devil attacks more than just believers and he takes them they surrender they give in they give up and he takes them but what he don't know is when he comes against you it's not you're not alone what he didn't add into the equation and his all of his quail okay if i move this way and i do this and i'm gonna come around here i'm gonna attack right here and this is gonna be the weakest moment and i'm gonna take him out with this punch he failed to add in that equation that c gene of life on the inside of you he failed to add that's part of god that was placed inside of you amen before the foundation of the world that seed that was laying on the inside of you he failed to add in that holy ghost that had come and germinated that seed and brought it to life he failed to add that to his equation he didn't realize when he started tinkering with that one he was tinkering with some atomic power some nuclear power that wasn't going to just sit back and say okay devil i give up surrender know there's gonna be something on the inside that would rise up on a morning and she would hear a tape playing and a song being sung i can i will i do believe and she started writing it down and nailing it to her wall i can i will i do believe i'm not going to bow amen i'm not going to turn around i care i will i do believe i can i will i do believe i kept i was there can you feel the pulsation i can i will i do believe because i know he's going to answer by fire i know he's going to come on the scene and destroy the enemy that's trying to destroy me let me turn the camera towards heaven i can see jesus sitting on the throne what do you see i see he's still on the throne he's making intercessions on our behalf amen i can see him sitting on the throne coming daylight smokes rising from the furnace i see him down there watching he hasn't taken his eye off the situation he's watching he promised and that seed would overcome and he's watching it all at once a great angel comes up to his right side and stands at attention puts his hand on the sword it was gabriel father if you look down there there's a seat of abraham down there that's under attack they've been praying cries have been coming up and now they're going to the death let me go and i'll change the scene let me go and i'll make it all right amen he said no you're a good angel just stand right there wormwood come up and said father if you look down he said yeah i've been looking i've been watching all night hey man i i say his eyes on the sparrow i know he watches me i've watched them all night they're fixing to burn those three men up let me go you told me to turn loose the waters i have control i'll wipe it off the map so i can hear him say that's right you could do that you're a good angel have you done what i've i've asked you to since i created you you did too gabriel but this is not your job this is mine you've done what i've told you to do since you created you but this is not your job this is mine who's walking among the candlesticks this ain't an angel's job this is mine haven't i already gave you the sermon for wednesday night before it even happened i am the god that answers just when they were ready to take their last step i can see him stand up his priestly robes drops around him where he'd been sitting there bloody make an intercession upon our confession for he died to bring to pass everything and anything we ask where is our faith in him at him in him hat there he stands up motions this way here comes a big white cloud by him he steps on it calls the east wind north wind south wind and drives him like horses reaches up and grabs a hold of a zigzag light and cracks it across the sky and before they could ever take that step into the fire furnace he was standing there with a big palm fan keeping the blaze off of them he was in the middle of the fire he said i just wanted to have an opportunity to talk to you i wanted to bring you to this moment that i could talk to you i gave you the promise and i'm here to answer it and the king said how many did we put down in there they said three o king he said i see four men walking around unbound and unharmed down in that fire hallelujah amen the devil didn't realize who he was dealing with he's not dealing with just a person upon the earth or some washed up person or some other illegitimate child he is talking and dealing with sons and daughters of the king the seed of abraham and if he backed up that seat of abraham he's going to back up this seat of abraham and that seat of abraham and that seed of abraham oh come on somebody if he backed up that seat of abraham and that seed of abraham he'll back up that one and that one and that one and that one and that one hallelujah i want you to understand this battle did not come that you may be destroyed this battle came to destroy your enemy it's either to drive that devil out of your life hallelujah we fail to have time with many others but let's bring it down to our day we know the story little colored lady up in memphis tennessee had a son he went out she tried to raise him right tried to do what was right and he went out caught some kind of disease he's laying home dying his mama wasn't going to battle even though his son had sinned and even though he had done wrong and even though he went back on the way she had raised him she wasn't bowing no that's my son god gave me that boy she began to pray she began to call on god just bear with me for a moment but all i know a storm began to form clouds begin together do you hear me over here in this little little shack of a house down in a poor little spot in memphis tennessee is a little colored lady on her knees crying out to god and while she's praying storm clouds are gathering winds are starting to blow trees are starting to move things are starting to happen and she begins to pray and she says lord i'm like that shooting my woman and i'm not shooting by woman where is your elijah because she knew jesus christ is the saying and if he respected a woman before because of her prayer about her son he would do it again that ought to put some faith in our hearts amen what did he do he started building the atmosphere it started changing the atmospheres until where there's a plane coming across on the sidewalk going a certain direction and has to come down to land because of the problems and the situations brother branham he's a prophet but he don't even know what's going on you know god don't show his prophets everything and he gets out and he decides he needs to go mail some letters he goes down the post office and he's walking down there and he puts his letters in i believe and he he starts to turn around and says go this away so he just starts walking he starts walking in his mind my plane's going to leave me it's going to i need to turn back keep walking it's going to leave me it's going to go where am i keep walking and he's moving down he saw turn right and he goes down this way just keep walking what was drawing him a little prayer [Laughter] happened to be a little cutter lady leaning up against the gate because she not only prayed she believed in a god who could answer prayers and she had enough faith in her prayer to get up early in the morning and go put herself at that gate turn down this way he turns and he just keeps walking in his mind my plane's leaving it's done left and it's just over with her and he's coming down he's turnt turned down this way he turns and he sees this lady he says howdy and she goes howdy parson how did you know i was a parson how'd you know she said i was praying early this morning and i pray god i'm your shooting i'm like the shunammite woman where's your elijah and i've been out here waiting for you to come what did that prayer prayer changed atmospheres because this woman knew this god answers apparently she had some experience before in that department this god answers i believe we got experience in that department amen how many believes that i believe we got experience in a god who answers she invites him into her house he said i never felt more welcome in any place i've ever been in in that little home so just felt the presence of god and there's this little this big piece of this big boy laying on the bed just groaning and moaning and she told him the things that had went on and he said well let's pray he said why don't you pray and she began to pray that you begin to call out to the lord maybe you've prayed for your boy don't give up maybe you prayed for your daughter don't give up maybe you pray for a situation that's around don't give up god is still god he said i said my i never heard a prayer like that prayed with such sincerity she got through and he began to pray and he said lord you know i'm here you brought me to this place this man has been attacked by this disease you know the things that has happened you know what's taking place i ask god that you'll give him back his life said he began to speak mama
