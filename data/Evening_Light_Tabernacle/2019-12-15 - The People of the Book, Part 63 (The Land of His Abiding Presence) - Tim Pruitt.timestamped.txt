[42:57] the internet those that are are in need

[43:03] Great God that understands humanity it's
[43:07] because you became one of us and tasted
[43:10] what we have to go through Lord so that
[43:13] you could be a perfect mediator that we
[43:16] could know when we come to you you
[43:18] understand that you're not just a
[43:19] distant Spirit God who could not
[43:22] understand what it means to suffer and
[43:26] then to bear the weight of sin and
[43:28] transgression but Lord you became one of
[43:32] us and took on our sins but Lord that's
[43:35] not the end of the story we have become
[43:38] your righteousness and Lord because of
[43:42] your blood we're perfected and we know
[43:45] Lord we're asking great things today
[43:47] that you'll do the exceeding abundantly
[43:50] above that which we're able to think are
[43:52] asked now as we commit the service to
[43:55] you in Jesus name Amen amen god bless

[44:05] verse the scripture again and then also
[44:07] st. John 15:7 we're going to visit that
[44:12] scripture again as we just look into the
[44:15] Word of God I want to speak today on the
[44:19] land of his abiding presence
[44:22] and we have been talking about coming
[44:24] into the land of our inheritance and the
[44:28] in this land is his abiding presence a
[44:32] man we want to speak about that today
[44:36] verse 53 numbers chapter 33 and ye shall
[44:41] dispossessed the inhabitants of Zion and
[44:43] dwell therein for I have given you the
[44:47] land to possess it and then John 15:7
[44:52] John 15:7 if you abide in me and my
[44:57] words abide in you you shall ask what
[44:59] you will and it shall be done unto you
[45:02] herein is my father glorified that you

[45:08] disciples amen god bless you you can be
[45:12] seated as we look into our subject today
[45:16] and we we want to make everyone feel
[45:21] welcome and a part of the service today
[45:24] we're really happy for you to be here
[45:26] with us the different ones that have
[45:28] gathered with us
[45:29] I have special family members that are
[45:31] here nieces and nephews and so on that
[45:35] are here with us today that we're just
[45:37] really happy to have with us pray God's
[45:40] blessings upon you and all of you that
[45:43] has assembled with us no matter where
[45:45] you're from Jesus knows you amen and he
[45:48] cares
[45:49] amen we're just really happy to have you
[45:52] and and to be with us
[45:54] we have also sister canvases
[45:57] grandparents brother Danny and sister
[46:00] Vicky Ward's so we're happy to have them
[46:02] with us today and just pray that the
[46:05] Lord will bless them in a mighty way and
[46:07] you hear that assembled with us all of
[46:09] the home folks so glad you're here today
[46:11] amen I'm glad to be here and I'm glad
[46:15] Jesus is here
[46:16] we've already felt his presence we've
[46:18] welcomed him with a words of our song as
[46:23] we sang to him and worship Him and now
[46:26] we just want to let him speak to us
[46:28] through the word now so as I said we're
[46:32] gonna be speaking on the land of the
[46:35] above
[46:35] in presence and this is so important
[46:38] because we're where we have arrived in
[46:42] this day and our is is not just a time
[46:45] where we're that the Spirit of God will
[46:49] depart and leave from us but it is the
[46:52] promise of a comforter that abides with
[46:55] us forever
[46:57] now Jesus our Joshua our who is
[47:01] Jehovah's Saviour actually his name in
[47:03] the the Greek is actually Yeshua are the
[47:07] Hebrew and it is the same word as Yeshua
[47:11] that led the children of Israel in their
[47:14] promised land and our Yahshua or Joshua
[47:17] or Jesus as said in the Greek has
[47:20] brought us from the law into this land
[47:23] of the Holy Ghost and I wouldn't say
[47:26] it's a land flowing of milk and honey a
[47:28] man now like Egypt was to Israel the law
[47:32] was bondage and it kept men slaves to
[47:36] sin because it had nothing that would
[47:39] deliver men from sins clutches it only
[47:43] showed that men were sinners but it did
[47:46] nothing to deliver them the sacrifice
[47:50] that they had was that a blood and bulls
[47:52] and goats and it was weak in that it
[47:55] could not atone for sin because the
[47:58] blood of bulls and goats cannot take
[48:00] away sin neither could it replace in
[48:04] nature with the nature of an innocent
[48:08] sacrifice so it only showed that men
[48:12] were sinners
[48:13] and did nothing to deliver them now
[48:16] Jesus as our forerunner would actually
[48:19] be come the head of a new race because
[48:23] Adams race has fallen and and of course
[48:27] in the Adam's race all men die and so we
[48:32] were sceptic unto death and to
[48:34] separation from God from our first birth
[48:38] and Jesus as a forerunner though would
[48:41] be the first to hitter in this new land
[48:44] and he would be the first
[48:47] the new creation and upon him the spirit
[48:51] would come to abide now if you'll look
[48:54] with me to John chapter 1 verse 32 the
[48:57] Bible said that John bear record saying
[48:59] I saw the Spirit descended from heaven
[49:02] like a dove and hid a boat upon him and
[49:06] I knew him not but he that sent me to
[49:09] baptize with water the same said it said
[49:11] unto me of whom thou shalt see the
[49:14] spirit descending and remaining on him
[49:18] the same as he which baptizeth with the
[49:21] Holy Ghost so we see that Jesus had been
[49:26] prophesied actually in the scripture and
[49:29] John actually would be quickened by the
[49:31] Holy Ghost and let me know that it would
[49:35] be one the one that would be the Messiah
[49:37] would be the one you see the Spirit
[49:39] descend upon but not just a sin but that
[49:43] he would remain on him and of course
[49:48] this would set him apart from all of the
[49:51] Old Testament prophets because of the
[49:54] Old Testament prophets the Spirit of God
[49:56] would would come upon them and they
[49:58] would prophesy and the Spirit of God
[50:00] would leave but if I'm Jesus the Spirit
[50:04] of God would remain and notice that he
[50:08] would be a vessel that the Holy Ghost
[50:10] would not just come upon for a season or
[50:13] for a prophecy and then leave but a man
[50:16] that the Spirit of God would abide in
[50:19] and remain this is prophesied in the
[50:23] scripture and Isaiah chapter 11 verse 1
[50:26] and there shall come forth a rod out of
[50:29] the stem of Jesse and a branch shall
[50:31] grow out of his roots and the spear of
[50:34] the Lord shall rest and this word means
[50:37] settle down and remain upon him the
[50:41] spirit of wisdom and understanding the
[50:43] spirit of counsel and might and the
[50:45] spirit of knowledge and of the fear of
[50:47] the Lord
[50:49] chapter 42 of Isaiah Isaiah chapter a
[50:52] verse 1 says behold my servant whom I
[50:55] was hold my life
[50:58] in my and whom my soul delighteth I have
[51:01] not put my spirit upon him and he shall
[51:04] bring for judgment to the Gentiles and
[51:07] of course then we remember the one that
[51:09] Jesus referred to himself in Isaiah 61
[51:13] and 1 the Spirit of the Lord is upon me
[51:15] because he has anointed me to preach
[51:18] good tidings to the meek he has sent me
[51:20] to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim
[51:23] Liberty to the captives and the opening
[51:26] of the prison to them that are bound so
[51:29] Jesus was a man who had the spirit but
[51:34] not as the Old Testament prophets had
[51:36] the spirit the Old Testament prophets
[51:39] were and men and women they were
[51:41] certainly anointed and and even spoke of
[51:44] it being filled with the spirit but
[51:46] never had they the spirit to come down
[51:49] and abide or to dwell in man as it did
[51:54] in Jesus
[51:55] none of the Old Testament prophets nor
[51:58] shall I say the New Testaments disciples
[52:02] had the spirits indwelling before
[52:04] Pentecost we will look in John chapter 7
[52:09] 38 for our reference here he that
[52:11] believeth on me as the Scriptures said
[52:13] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[52:16] living water but this he spake of the
[52:20] Spirit which day that believe on him
[52:24] should receive for the Holy Ghost was
[52:26] not yet given because Jesus was not yet
[52:31] glorified so we see it would take his
[52:35] death burial and resurrection and
[52:37] ascension and his glorification in order
[52:41] for the Holy Ghost to come back and to
[52:44] end well man and this would of course be
[52:47] the start of a new race
[52:49] not another Hebrew race not of the
[52:53] lineage of abraham's natural scene but
[52:55] the lineage of abraham's face seed and
[52:57] this would be a new race that would not
[53:00] be just human but they would be born
[53:02] again and it would be born of the god
[53:05] reigns
[53:06] now even as John the greatest prophet of
[53:10] all set I can only baptize you with
[53:12] water but there is one that is coming
[53:15] after me he's got a greater baptism than
[53:19] I did and when he comes he is going to
[53:23] be the Holy Ghost Baptizer and and he
[53:28] will baptize you with the Holy Ghost in
[53:30] other words he was share with you he is
[53:34] all my life a man that the life of this
[53:38] Lamb of God would be different from the
[53:41] other lambs that would represent him
[53:44] that would substitute for man's sin
[53:47] until he came but he would be different
[53:50] and that is he would share his own life
[53:54] that the life and the nature of the
[53:57] sacrifice would actually come and dwell
[54:00] in the worshiper now in Luke chapter 3
[54:07] verse 16 John answered saying unto them
[54:10] all I indeed baptize you with water but
[54:13] one mightier than I cometh the lachen of
[54:18] whose shoes I'm not worthy to unloose
[54:21] and he shall baptize you with the Holy
[54:25] Ghost and with fire so I want you to
[54:30] notice this one would come with baptize
[54:32] you with the Holy Ghost and fire we'll
[54:36] talk about that a little moment but in a
[54:39] moment but let's also go to Jesus words
[54:41] in John our Acts chapter 1 and verse 4
[54:44] and being a symbol together with them
[54:46] commanded them that they should not
[54:49] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[54:51] promise of the father which said he you
[54:54] have heard of me for John truly baptized
[54:57] with water but you shall be baptized
[55:00] with the Holy Ghost not many days hence
[55:05] so how different this anointing would be
[55:08] from the anointing on the Old Testament
[55:11] believer their anointing came and went
[55:15] but this anointing would abide with you
[55:19] forever and man it would be more than
[55:23] just a presence come down upon you and
[55:27] you rejoice in it you prophesy in it you
[55:31] heal the sick in it and then it leaves
[55:33] you and you fall back into temptation
[55:37] but this would be one that would abide
[55:39] with you he would actually well in you
[55:43] and you would be one hallelujah and you
[55:50] would become the manifestation of the
[55:53] Father's will now John chapter SIV 14
[55:57] verse 16 it says I will pray the father
[55:59] and he shall give you another comforter
[56:02] now Jesus was a comforter you can
[56:05] imagine as he went along you know he was
[56:08] certainly Mary and Martha's comforter
[56:10] when he come there to the tomb of
[56:12] Lazarus he was a comforter for the widow
[56:15] at name he was he was he was a comforter
[56:18] of them many who were sick and healed he
[56:21] was a comforter to the disciples who
[56:23] we'll talk about here in a moment
[56:25] we're word that they called for demons
[56:28] to come out of the young Boyd and
[56:29] couldn't cast him out he was definitely
[56:31] a comforter but he said I'm gonna
[56:33] deceive you another comforter that he
[56:36] may abide with you until I'm tempted
[56:46] he will abide with you how long forever
[56:50] even the Spirit of Truth whom the world
[56:54] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[56:58] and it neither knoweth him but you know
[57:02] him for he dwelleth with you a man
[57:06] hallelujah and shall be in you so right
[57:12] now he's dwelling with you my disciples
[57:14] but in that day he will be in you and
[57:19] there's going to be a vast difference
[57:21] between one who is dwelling with you and
[57:25] somebody toiling in you remember calls
[57:28] the disciples can go away without Jesus
[57:31] and they can get on a boat without Jesus
[57:34] and they could brainstorms without Jesus
[57:37] hallelujah but wouldn't you get this
[57:40] comforter he's there and every stone
[57:43] he's there in every situation first John
[58:02] chapter 2 verse 27 he explains that the
[58:06] anointing which you have received
[58:09] abideth in you and you need not that any
[58:12] man teach you but as the same anointing
[58:15] teaches you of all things and his truth
[58:18] and is no lie and even as it had taught
[58:21] you ye shall abide in him so now we see
[58:27] this anointing bided in you and he says
[58:30] he would be the inside teacher now this
[58:33] doesn't replace or do away with the
[58:35] necessity of the faithful ministry of
[58:38] apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[58:40] and pastors but rather you know he's
[58:42] there when the pastor isn't there man
[58:46] he's there when the - when that teacher
[58:48] isn't there that has taught you the
[58:50] concepts of the gospel he is there
[58:53] inside teacher who is showing you the
[58:56] way who is directing your path who is
[59:01] showing you where to place your feet the
[59:05] inside teacher he'll convince you of sin
[59:08] now this what this Holy Ghost would that
[59:12] was promised that would come he would
[59:14] not leave them no no not an hour of
[59:16] temptation it would keep them in a box
[59:19] but the Holy Ghost says is not something
[59:23] really that you keep and man it keeps
[59:27] you a lot of times we say Lord you know
[59:34] I can just hold barely hold on well
[59:38] really you know if it's him it ain't you
[59:41] holding on anymore anyhow a man today
[59:45] you got a hold of him miss got him got a
[59:47] hold of you and there's a whole lot of
[59:50] difference we got in temptation because
[59:53] you are weak your flesh is weak your
[59:55] willpower is weak Amen but there is an
[59:59] inside dwelling of the Holy Ghost that
[1:00:03] will keep you in your hour of temptation
[1:00:07] now let's just see what happened to man
[1:00:10] as we explained as we go to this because
[1:00:14] as I said this is a land is certainly
[1:00:17] flowing with milk and honey it's rich is
[1:00:20] one that mankind had never experienced
[1:00:23] before the land of the Holy Ghost the
[1:00:26] land of the new creation is the land of
[1:00:30] his abiding presence it's the land where
[1:00:34] only God men dwell hallelujah
[1:00:41] it's the land of the Spirit and nobody
[1:00:46] knows what it is except those who have
[1:00:49] been there
[1:00:51] it's kind of like the boy with Apple you
[1:00:55] know was standing there listening to an
[1:00:58] atheist going back and forth on and
[1:01:00] argued with others about whether that
[1:01:02] was a god and by me the little boy
[1:01:06] got enough of it and he just sent her
[1:01:08] chewing on an apple and he said Amen
[1:01:11] said tell me can this Apple is this
[1:01:13] Apple sweeter sour
[1:01:14] he said god I know you're the one eating
[1:01:17] and he said that's what I thought
[1:01:21] Amen people want to tell you what the
[1:01:23] Holy Ghost is I want to tell you what I
[1:01:25] can or can't do or whether sweet or sour
[1:01:27] they don't know you know the sweetness
[1:01:34] up you know the power up you have the
[1:01:38] assurance of it you know that you know
[1:01:41] you and let you know the Bible says and
[1:01:43] that day you shall know that I'm in the
[1:01:45] father the father in me and I in you
[1:01:48] you're not imagining that you're there
[1:01:51] you're there but let's go back in for a
[1:01:55] moment to Genesis and there are thinking
[1:01:58] and let's go back see what happened to
[1:02:01] man Adam was made first a spirit million
[1:02:06] this is why the confusion seems would be
[1:02:08] with Genesis chapter 1 and 2 is because
[1:02:11] in Genesis 1 Adam is created of God in
[1:02:17] Genesis 2 his body is formed so what is
[1:02:22] a creation 1 is a formation and so God
[1:02:26] God first of all God is a spirit and he
[1:02:30] made man in the image of God so he was
[1:02:34] first spirit man we're done about the
[1:02:37] the first Adam and God made man in his
[1:02:42] spirit he made him in his in
[1:02:46] but in his body as you know he had
[1:02:50] attributes of the earth and and there
[1:02:53] was you know he had hair like a mammal
[1:02:55] he he had different other other
[1:03:00] identities that identified him with the
[1:03:03] earth his see taste smell smell feeling
[1:03:07] here all contacted the earthly realm but
[1:03:11] originally he was he was spirit man and
[1:03:17] then God would place that spirit that he
[1:03:20] had created in a body that he had formed
[1:03:23] and now there would be a man that could
[1:03:26] till the soil a man because he was not
[1:03:30] going to do it in spirit he was going to
[1:03:32] do it as man
[1:03:33] so you see within him Adam was actually
[1:03:37] different from the rest of God's
[1:03:40] creation because here Adam had a spirit
[1:03:46] made by God and this and it had within
[1:03:51] him the ability to be filled with God's
[1:03:55] Spirit
[1:03:57] now that's and of course that what makes
[1:04:01] him difference between man and animal is
[1:04:04] that man that God made had a soul and
[1:04:09] that soul is the choice chamber it
[1:04:13] accepts or rejects the spirit now the
[1:04:16] animal doesn't do that it has no soul it
[1:04:21] makes no choice but a man is made in
[1:04:25] God's image because God didn't want him
[1:04:29] just to be a robot God wanted him to be
[1:04:33] able to make a choice between life and
[1:04:38] death
[1:04:38] as to what nature would in fill him so
[1:04:44] now as we look at it Adam was major
[1:04:46] place to be filled his his heart was to
[1:04:49] be surrendered to God so God could dwell
[1:04:52] in him but before he made
[1:04:56] Surrender Adams surrendered his soul and
[1:05:00] therefore the soul of every one of his
[1:05:04] offspring to be filled with and ruled by
[1:05:07] sin nature and so yet every one of us
[1:05:12] you know every one of us as Adam as
[1:05:16] Adams rates we still have the ability of
[1:05:18] self wheels that we can surrender our
[1:05:21] soul to God and our we could surrender
[1:05:25] it to sin nature you see in other words
[1:05:29] sin nature can be overthrown and we can
[1:05:32] become the chip or the dwelling place of
[1:05:35] the Living God so that's the Bible said
[1:05:38] by one man's obedience speaking of Jesus
[1:05:41] that every one of his offsprings are to
[1:05:44] be filled with divine nature and all
[1:05:48] because of Adam's disobedience every man
[1:05:50] of his Osprey of his is born with sin
[1:05:54] nature for it says in Romans 5:17 for if
[1:05:59] by one man's offense death reigned by
[1:06:02] one much more they which receive
[1:06:05] abundance of grace and of the gift of
[1:06:08] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[1:06:11] Jesus Christ
[1:06:13] so by one man's offense we were all born
[1:06:16] in sin but by one man's obedience by one
[1:06:24] man's obedience we reign in
[1:06:27] righteousness in one man's disobedience
[1:06:31] we are obedient to sin we are slaves of
[1:06:37] sin but in one man's obedience we are
[1:06:40] now free from sin I remember no longer
[1:06:44] slaves who I would sometimes the church
[1:06:47] could you're in rhythm it's slave
[1:06:49] mentality I realize I'm not a slave to
[1:06:52] singing
[1:06:53] a man it has no control over me I don't
[1:06:58] belong to the devil a mother's God's
[1:07:02] before the foundation of the world my
[1:07:04] choice didn't make me God's his choice
[1:07:06] made me his he knew who I was before the
[1:07:11] world ever began and if I ordained my
[1:07:14] comin hallelujah and though I was born
[1:07:18] in sin he said I've got a remedy for the
[1:07:31] Bible said in Colossians 1:13 that he
[1:07:33] have delivered us from the power of
[1:07:35] darkness and translated us into the
[1:07:38] kingdom are the rule of his dear son
[1:07:46] let's put the devil on notice we don't
[1:07:49] belong to him
[1:07:51] this kingdom we're in Satan has no right
[1:07:55] to aim at displaces the only man and
[1:08:02] woman back again like Adam and Eve were
[1:08:05] before the two trees in Eden one a tree
[1:08:08] of life one a tree of death and we can
[1:08:13] choose between life or death now in your
[1:08:18] first birth you did not choose to be
[1:08:21] born with sin nature you were born with
[1:08:25] sin heaven rule over you because Adam
[1:08:28] sold his offspring his self he suited
[1:08:32] the whole human race to Satan David
[1:08:36] would say that's in sin did my mother
[1:08:38] conceive me and I was shapen in iniquity
[1:08:41] I was brought in the world speaking lies
[1:08:44] as a combination about three sons but
[1:08:48] it's all the same a man that this is
[1:08:50] what happened man was born in a depraved
[1:08:54] sinful condition this is why the Bible
[1:08:58] would say all have sinned and fallen
[1:09:01] short of the glory of God
[1:09:03] but however every man at some point is
[1:09:08] brought before the Tree of Life and some
[1:09:11] manner and that tree of life of course
[1:09:14] is Jesus Christ and and they choose
[1:09:17] between remaining under sins rule or
[1:09:21] whether to surrender their soul to God
[1:09:24] now understand predestination and I'm
[1:09:27] not I'm not arguing that the thought of
[1:09:29] predestination and God's choice over
[1:09:31] your choice
[1:09:32] I'm saying is God God even in his
[1:09:35] foreknowledge new-year choice a man and
[1:09:39] you choose because you were here that's
[1:09:43] why you choose it's why you choose life
[1:09:45] because you were here there's something
[1:09:49] in you that calls back out to Almighty
[1:09:53] God but notice that again you stand
[1:09:57] there every man and woman they either
[1:10:00] receive or turn down eternal life in
[1:10:05] fact of the matter is brother Branham
[1:10:07] would say that every sinner fights his
[1:10:10] way to hell hey ma'am and the Bible said
[1:10:17] it's not his will that any should perish
[1:10:21] right he don't want anybody lost he
[1:10:25] don't why he don't want anybody lost and
[1:10:27] all this says just settle a question for
[1:10:30] you right now there won't be one of his
[1:10:32] children in hell hell was not created
[1:10:39] for his children hell was created for
[1:10:43] the devil and his angels a mouth but
[1:10:50] then you know let me share a couple of
[1:10:52] the quotations as we go along
[1:10:54] when you come to total obedience then
[1:10:58] you can have possession but until you
[1:11:02] totally obey you got it totally or
[1:11:05] completely surrender your own thoughts
[1:11:07] your own wield your own mind and let the
[1:11:09] mind of Christ operate in you again he
[1:11:16] would say when you fully surrender he'll
[1:11:18] come in fully but until you surrender he
[1:11:22] can't come in fully surrender surrender
[1:11:25] your thoughts surrender your thinking
[1:11:26] surrender your life
[1:11:28] surrender your all surrender your
[1:11:30] prestige surrender everything to him now
[1:11:32] and he'll come in and fill you with the
[1:11:35] Holy Ghost and I'll tell you the problem
[1:11:38] every time when people lack the Holy
[1:11:41] Spirit in their life after asking God
[1:11:43] for it is comes right back to this one
[1:11:46] thing of full surrender the lack thereof
[1:11:50] in the Old Testament the atonement was
[1:11:54] limited because it is only the blood are
[1:11:57] there of an animal and the NSE of the
[1:12:00] nature of the animal sacrificed could
[1:12:03] not enter into the worshipper fine
[1:12:06] because it had no soul amen but under
[1:12:10] this atonement of the Lamb Jesus Christ
[1:12:14] here we come back to this by baptism of
[1:12:18] fire come on by baptism of fire a latter
[1:12:24] case sin nature and replaces dead all
[1:12:29] nature with the very life and the nature
[1:12:32] of God sealing you with God and seasons
[1:12:36] Satan our that's why if you willfully
[1:12:42] surrender to the Holy Spirit allow him
[1:12:44] to sanctified you fully and be sealed by
[1:12:47] his spirit you will never fall now
[1:12:53] brother branham would use the virtues in
[1:12:56] in 2nd Peter 1 to show that a person who
[1:13:00] has believed on the Lord and started
[1:13:02] with the foundation of faith that he
[1:13:04] must add these virtues through
[1:13:06] sanctification and even be kept off with
[1:13:10] divine love of God which is the Holy
[1:13:12] Ghost and Peter concludes by saying if
[1:13:16] you like these virtues you're blind and
[1:13:19] you've forgot what the Bloodless to do
[1:13:22] for you but if you allow the holy good
[1:13:24] the Holy Spirit to sanctify and cleanse
[1:13:26] out the old sin nature and then filled
[1:13:29] you then you will never fall a man how
[1:13:35] many wants to be in that place
[1:13:38] that no matter what storm of life no
[1:13:42] matter what kind of gossip among the
[1:13:44] leaf comes by no matter what persuasion
[1:13:48] or somebody was a better argument and
[1:13:51] that nothing ever can separate you from
[1:13:54] the love of God in Christ Jesus
[1:13:57] 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 9 but he that
[1:14:00] lack of these things is blind and cannot
[1:14:03] see afar off and has forgotten that he
[1:14:05] was purged from his old sin wherefore
[1:14:09] the rather brother give diligence to
[1:14:10] make your calling and election sure for
[1:14:12] if you do these things ye shall never
[1:14:16] fall what state to be what a place of
[1:14:23] security oh my what a place to be sealed
[1:14:27] away to your destination
[1:14:33] now before Jesus came men had the Holy
[1:14:37] Spirit as their anointing some were
[1:14:40] anointed with it actually said cells
[1:14:42] they were filled with the spirit and yet
[1:14:45] as filled as they were two they would
[1:14:47] prophesy and and foretell and see
[1:14:51] visions and and even work miracles they
[1:14:55] were not sealed the Holy Spirit would
[1:14:59] come upon them and they would leave and
[1:15:04] for example for this just as you can be
[1:15:06] baptized and fully immersed in water and
[1:15:10] not one drop of water get into your body
[1:15:13] so can a person be baptized with the
[1:15:17] Holy Ghost upon their spirit and they
[1:15:19] jump in the shower and dance and speak
[1:15:22] in tongues and prophesy and work
[1:15:25] miracles and have healing and signs and
[1:15:28] wonders and still have sin nature within
[1:15:32] their soul and on the other hand you
[1:15:37] might be a sealed son or daughter of God
[1:15:39] and never perform a miracle and that
[1:15:42] doesn't mean you're not sealed for those
[1:15:45] things are unknown believers man
[1:15:48] now in the Old Testament
[1:15:51] and even in the new Claude we'll give
[1:15:54] people certain gifts and these gifts are
[1:15:58] given without repentance in other words
[1:16:02] many of many times if they're men and
[1:16:04] women are born with them and and they
[1:16:08] haven't even repented and so that
[1:16:12] without repentance and these gifts again
[1:16:15] you know can come under the anointing
[1:16:17] and God can use them and the old
[1:16:22] testament men would be gifted by the by
[1:16:24] God to fight I mean would be mighty
[1:16:27] warriors that the spear the Lord would
[1:16:30] move upon them and they would defeat the
[1:16:33] enemies of Sian and subdue them because
[1:16:37] of the Spirit and the anointing of God
[1:16:39] upon them and they would yield that give
[1:16:42] to God and use that gift to deliver
[1:16:45] God's people and there were there's
[1:16:47] gifted men like Moses or sense and or
[1:16:51] Saul and David that we can use as
[1:16:54] examples were thus appear the Lord would
[1:16:57] come on them and yet in the hour of
[1:17:00] temptation they would he yielded him
[1:17:03] tation and sin and God would withdraw
[1:17:06] his presence from them because he only
[1:17:09] had one birth under the Old Testament
[1:17:12] and there was no way they could ever be
[1:17:15] born out of sins Dominion so no matter
[1:17:19] how they were born a seed of Abraham and
[1:17:23] no matter how annoying did they become
[1:17:26] that days to were under sins dominions
[1:17:31] when Moses was tempted to show off
[1:17:34] earnings and then exalt himself the
[1:17:37] spirit lifted and the tempter one a
[1:17:41] month this very thing would keep him out
[1:17:45] of the promised land when the Balaam was
[1:17:48] tempted with money imposition the spirit
[1:17:52] left and the tempter once when Samson
[1:17:56] was tempted with pretty Philistine women
[1:17:59] the tempter was
[1:18:01] and the spirit departed Sampson was a
[1:18:06] gifted man he had a super strength that
[1:18:11] didn't compromise human abilities much
[1:18:14] different what we visualized some big
[1:18:16] atlas with muscles and tall and strong
[1:18:19] and all of this he was a little wimp
[1:18:23] maybe a little sissies boy with seven
[1:18:26] locks representing his covenant with God
[1:18:30] but he was gifted and man he was gifted
[1:18:34] though he was just a little scrawny boy
[1:18:37] yet he was gifted so that he can heal
[1:18:40] himself to God and the Spirit of the
[1:18:43] Lord but come upon him and empower him
[1:18:47] so much that when he met a life the
[1:18:50] Bible said the spear the Lord came upon
[1:18:53] him and he took that lion and he ripped
[1:18:57] him apart and she would a little a
[1:19:00] little goat kid Simpson would give his
[1:19:06] trick to God but he would never give God
[1:19:09] his heart in his heart was adultery and
[1:19:13] fornication and his heart was
[1:19:16] compromised in his heart was a desire to
[1:19:19] go down to the the Philistine daughters
[1:19:22] and compromise God's Word and and he
[1:19:25] would get in a dilemma and the Spirit
[1:19:28] the Lord would come upon Samson and he
[1:19:30] would surrender his faith in his gift
[1:19:32] and his faith was the deposit was in the
[1:19:37] deposit of his gift that God had placed
[1:19:39] within him and he would perform
[1:19:41] supernatural acts and he would have
[1:19:43] tremendous victories you know people do
[1:19:49] this you see you means even today
[1:19:52] because many of them never come into the
[1:19:54] new land are still outside I can hear
[1:19:56] brother branham preach and he said Oh
[1:19:58] God
[1:19:59] that my church would come over into this
[1:20:02] land of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:04] it was his desire but some people will
[1:20:10] give their their ability to God their
[1:20:14] ability like of singing they will give
[1:20:17] God that ability they're gifted their
[1:20:20] knowing it is saying maybe maybe comes
[1:20:22] down their family line there daddy their
[1:20:24] mother somebody or maybe you know it's
[1:20:27] like some of the horses that race then
[1:20:29] nobody in their pedigree that was any
[1:20:31] good and he's a fluke and some diamonds
[1:20:37] and genetics it skips generations as you
[1:20:41] know if there's anything and then my
[1:20:43] family I didn't get it Julie is doing my
[1:20:46] singing for me but yet you see these are
[1:20:51] gifted and anointed to sing and and some
[1:20:55] can have sinful habits maybe just
[1:20:59] yesterday that were watching pornography
[1:21:01] or even fornicating with their boyfriend
[1:21:05] or girlfriend and they feel terrible
[1:21:07] about it they feel guilty about it and
[1:21:11] yep they're shamed and when they get up
[1:21:15] to sing in church you know all they know
[1:21:19] is when they get up to saying people are
[1:21:21] so blessed and people come to them after
[1:21:26] the service and say you don't have a
[1:21:28] super nest by your ministry of singing
[1:21:30] and I was going through such a terrible
[1:21:33] trial and a hard time and God use me to
[1:21:37] hell to use you to help me and it's so
[1:21:40] bless me you know what that does it
[1:21:43] encourages him to keep on going the way
[1:21:45] they are you know I felt I didn't know
[1:21:51] anyone I must be alright
[1:21:53] you know I sung the songs of silent Wow
[1:21:57] even brother Jim got up and shouted and
[1:22:03] yet living in sin a person can be so
[1:22:08] annoying to preach and yet be living in
[1:22:11] adultery
[1:22:12] while he's preaching
[1:22:16] I said just last night was with a
[1:22:18] prostitute and yet up to preach and get
[1:22:21] so anointed by the spirit that others
[1:22:24] get delivered gasp even demons are cast
[1:22:28] out or a miracle is performed and this
[1:22:34] is why when canvases ylim it was an
[1:22:36] office of the high priests that while he
[1:22:40] was condemning Jesus to death and
[1:22:45] demanded he be crucified he prophesized
[1:22:49] by the spirit hey man this is this is in
[1:22:55] John 11 verse 51 and you can see it this
[1:22:59] big not even a cell but as high priest
[1:23:01] that year he prophesied can you imagine
[1:23:05] here he's in the throws and the very
[1:23:07] gentleman and he's condemning Jesus
[1:23:10] Christ and sending him to a cross to be
[1:23:14] crucified and he prophesized under the
[1:23:17] spirit this is why Jesus said in Matthew
[1:23:22] 7:21 not everyone that saith unto me
[1:23:25] Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom of
[1:23:27] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[1:23:30] father which is in heaven and you wonder
[1:23:34] what that will is I'll tell you is
[1:23:36] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:23:39] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:23:41] remission of sin and receive the gift of
[1:23:44] the Holy Ghost
[1:23:45] that's the Father's will oh man so it's
[1:23:48] not everyone that says send to me Lord
[1:23:51] Lord shall enter the kingdom but those
[1:23:54] who comes back repentance surrender the
[1:24:06] reason again anew in Christ many will
[1:24:12] come to me in that day and say Lord Lord
[1:24:14] have we not prophesied in thy name and
[1:24:18] in thy name have cast out Devils in my
[1:24:21] name have done many wonderful works and
[1:24:23] then I will confess to them I never knew
[1:24:27] you depart from me you that work
[1:24:30] iniquity and yet they have prophesied
[1:24:35] yet they have cast out devils yet they
[1:24:40] have done wonderful works and yet had
[1:24:43] never come to that obedience now why
[1:24:50] because although anointed they were
[1:24:53] never surrendered to the will of the
[1:24:55] Father to be sealed with the Holy Spirit
[1:24:58] of promise let's look at Balaam de
[1:25:02] cemento moment in numbers 24 - and
[1:25:04] Balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw
[1:25:07] Israel abiding in his tents according to
[1:25:10] their tribes and the Spirit of God came
[1:25:13] upon him now that he will prophesy and
[1:25:18] he will actually prophesied something
[1:25:21] that will come to pass that will lose
[1:25:25] that would be a prophecy of the Messiah
[1:25:27] a horn were raised up out of Jesse you
[1:25:31] know that will raise them out of Israel
[1:25:33] and our Jacob rather and here as it
[1:25:36] raises up a prophecy of the Messiah to
[1:25:39] come by the spirit but you see this is
[1:25:43] what made Balaam of false prophet
[1:25:46] because although he surrendered his gift
[1:25:49] to God to prophesy accurately he loved
[1:25:52] the wages of unrighteousness and used
[1:25:55] the error of his doctrine to cause
[1:25:58] Israel to fall by sea and we're all one
[1:26:01] and the Israelite son took the daughters
[1:26:04] of Moab and committed whoredom and
[1:26:06] Balaam worked it around
[1:26:10] to get God to smite them so he was able
[1:26:18] to do what he was hired to do when he
[1:26:22] could not get God to curse them he made
[1:26:24] them follow by false doctrine the Bible
[1:26:28] calls it the doctrine of balaam and the
[1:26:30] doctrine of Balaam was we're all one
[1:26:33] hey ma'am and so you know what he did
[1:26:37] that he would he would he actually
[1:26:40] looked there and he said hey we're all
[1:26:42] one you know this is what children this
[1:26:44] is Abraham's children we're all one you
[1:26:46] know get in there and worship together
[1:26:49] knowing that in their worship they mix
[1:26:55] fornication and now that would be taken
[1:26:58] in the strange daughters of lot who were
[1:27:02] under a curse and in this God would have
[1:27:05] to curse them can you imagine that so
[1:27:10] Balaam works it around to his doctor to
[1:27:14] get them cursed yet he can be anointed
[1:27:18] by the spirit and prophesy
[1:27:21] don't you understand this is why there's
[1:27:25] a great deception in the last day Mathew
[1:27:28] 24:24
[1:27:29] word that there will arise false
[1:27:31] prophets who are anointed wasn't in you
[1:27:36] an anointing and bring a deceiving
[1:27:44] spirit now think about it truly it would
[1:27:52] come and it would leave them this Holy
[1:27:55] Spirit would come it would leave them
[1:27:58] but they could not be sealed it would
[1:28:00] not abide with him forever another
[1:28:03] notable example is that of Saul who was
[1:28:06] in mourning because of his rebellious
[1:28:09] spirit and his disobedience the spirit
[1:28:13] left him and instead an evil spirit came
[1:28:17] upon him
[1:28:18] you see Saul was a king that the Spirit
[1:28:21] of God came upon him
[1:28:22] the side you know anything about the Old
[1:28:25] Testament the Bible said that saw
[1:28:27] prophesied with the prophets and the
[1:28:30] spear the Lord came upon him and yet
[1:28:33] because of his rebellious disobedient
[1:28:36] Lord but depart from the saw an evil
[1:28:39] spirit would trouble him in verse Samuel
[1:28:44] 16 verse 14 the spear Lord departed from
[1:28:47] Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord
[1:28:49] troubled him in other words permitted by
[1:28:52] God God permitted and an evil spirit to
[1:28:56] trouble him and they would call for a
[1:28:59] man with who was coming with the heart
[1:29:01] and it was David and he played for Saul
[1:29:04] during the time of his insanity and the
[1:29:07] evil spirit would lift for him from him
[1:29:10] for a while he'd be okay for a little
[1:29:13] bit and go out and fight the Lord's
[1:29:15] battles and come under such an anointing
[1:29:19] remember but I want you to know that
[1:29:21] then because of disobedience we're
[1:29:26] caught with establish his kingdom
[1:29:28] forever to be on the throne of Israel
[1:29:33] but the cause of his disobedience God
[1:29:36] rejected him hey man now David was a man
[1:29:42] also who despair the Lord came upon we
[1:29:46] look upon David very favorably because
[1:29:49] he was a man after God's own heart David
[1:29:52] was a man who unlike Saul he was always
[1:29:55] willing to for to repent a man the Bible
[1:29:59] said in 1st Samuel 1613 Samuel took a
[1:30:03] horrible oil and anointed him in the
[1:30:05] midst of his brother and the Spirit of
[1:30:06] the Lord came upon David from that day
[1:30:09] forward and and then he would David
[1:30:15] would come oh my he would become the
[1:30:18] anointed songwriter and he would sing
[1:30:22] and worship but governors such that we
[1:30:26] see
[1:30:27] reduce arms to this day and they're
[1:30:32] absolutely anointed words of God hey man
[1:30:40] he would get so under the anointing then
[1:30:44] he would actually even speak in the
[1:30:46] first person of Christ and he would
[1:30:49] prophesy as though he were Christ
[1:30:51] himself and saved my bones my bones they
[1:30:55] stank me you know they today they have
[1:30:59] wounded my hands and my feet all the
[1:31:02] other different prophesied you know you
[1:31:03] know what they are laying in the
[1:31:05] scripture that Campbell over my garments
[1:31:07] oh no no no he would prophesy in the
[1:31:11] very first person of Christ David would
[1:31:17] say had his closing days in 2nd samuel
[1:31:21] 23:2
[1:31:22] the spear the lord spake by me and his
[1:31:26] word was in my tongue and we can attest
[1:31:30] to that today right hey man the spear
[1:31:34] the Lord's paid by him and his words was
[1:31:38] in my tongue and David would get under
[1:31:42] the spirits I said and prophesy in the
[1:31:46] spirit even accurately described the
[1:31:50] scenes of Calvary and what Jesus would
[1:31:53] go through you can hear him no groaning
[1:31:57] when he sinned with Bathsheba did an
[1:31:59] awful thing and killed her husband in
[1:32:01] the Psalms he's repenting in some 5110
[1:32:05] he would say clear created me a clean
[1:32:08] heart O God and renew a right spirit in
[1:32:11] me and cast me not away from thy
[1:32:14] presence and take not thy Holy Spirit
[1:32:16] from me because he knew he knew that
[1:32:20] when they're 19 left saw that he was a
[1:32:23] haunted by a demon and he didn't want to
[1:32:28] be a doctor
[1:32:29] addition so he cried out take the spirit
[1:32:33] from David was a predestinated see he
[1:32:40] was a prophet as a seed of God brother
[1:32:43] Branham would say unspoken words
[1:32:45] original seed he lacked the rain of the
[1:32:47] moisture of the spirit to quicken the
[1:32:49] seed but yet it always just cried out I
[1:32:53] want to do right I want to live right I
[1:32:56] want to overcome Oh
[1:33:00] created me a clean heart I can't live
[1:33:03] right there was nothing under the blood
[1:33:08] of bulls and goats and could give him a
[1:33:10] new nature he was the same oh boy after
[1:33:13] spirit left him as he was when the
[1:33:15] Spirit came down he would come to the
[1:33:18] anointing and accurately prophesy as a
[1:33:20] just had get under the spirit my bones
[1:33:23] they stirred me they pierce my hands my
[1:33:25] feet they pierce my thigh
[1:33:27] they beiieve it gets under inspiration
[1:33:29] he'd actually prophesy exactly as what
[1:33:34] Jesus Christ the Son of David would do
[1:33:36] but he had nothing to hold him in the
[1:33:40] hour of temptation I want you say today
[1:33:44] it'd be awesome wouldn't it to have the
[1:33:47] Spirit of God that comes in such a
[1:33:49] manner where you proper sign your words
[1:33:52] are even written in the Bible and your
[1:33:57] words become the Holy Scripture and your
[1:34:00] words are fulfilled in Jesus Christ but
[1:34:04] how much greater is it that deity comes
[1:34:08] on the inside of your soul and gives you
[1:34:11] overcoming power
[1:34:13] how much greater is that David knew you
[1:34:21] know or he did everything he knew to do
[1:34:23] as an Israelite here or fringes with a
[1:34:28] ribbon of blue all over his garments and
[1:34:33] he would look upon those and remember
[1:34:36] all of the commandments of the Lord and
[1:34:39] Dude him and say you know that day he
[1:34:43] was commanded to do this this is what
[1:34:44] all Israelites dress like every one of
[1:34:47] them would have this ribbon of blue
[1:34:50] there was me waved or woven through the
[1:34:55] fringes of their garments so that as he
[1:34:58] as God said that all of the commensal of
[1:35:01] the Lord that you'll remember and do
[1:35:03] them and that you seek not after your
[1:35:05] own heart in your own eyes after which
[1:35:07] you used to go a hurry so he says you
[1:35:11] know I look on this remember this I want
[1:35:15] to remind you it's in your garments it's
[1:35:18] a it's a lace of a blue ribbon all the
[1:35:21] way through to remind you there were
[1:35:24] things that were that they bound about
[1:35:27] as a sign of on their hands even the
[1:35:30] Jews today will wrap a cord around their
[1:35:33] hands and they may they have something
[1:35:37] between the frontlets of their eyes and
[1:35:39] Monday they wore wrote the commandments
[1:35:42] upon the posts of the house and upon the
[1:35:45] doors and I can imagine David would make
[1:35:48] vows and he made his promises and he
[1:35:52] would say thy word so I'm not sin
[1:35:57] against thee only to go wet around in
[1:36:01] the hour of temptation this is a danger
[1:36:07] of psychology you see psychology is not
[1:36:13] a nature change it is a learned behavior
[1:36:17] we train our behavior to do certain
[1:36:21] certain things that are not acceptable
[1:36:23] in society
[1:36:25] using the methods of psychology men
[1:36:28] makes promises that they intend to keep
[1:36:32] my mom I'm gonna be true to my wife this
[1:36:35] time I'm you know I've heard him in
[1:36:39] testimony meetings before in Midlands
[1:36:42] meetings where men will get up and say
[1:36:44] well here's how they overcame banoffee I
[1:36:47] overcame it because of what it was the
[1:36:51] harm it was doing to my family and I
[1:36:53] thought about the hurt I thought about
[1:36:56] the shame I thought about the bad
[1:36:58] feelings in it that it that it gave me
[1:37:03] when I did when I view dis pornography
[1:37:06] and so now when I think about
[1:37:07] pornography I make myself think about
[1:37:10] all the bad things that happens the hurt
[1:37:13] that if proud of my family in my
[1:37:16] marriage and the shame that it brought
[1:37:19] upon my church and and everything else
[1:37:22] I'm worried - let me - but I will gender
[1:37:25] said that's not overcoming that
[1:37:28] psychology in the hour of your
[1:37:33] temptation you forget all about that and
[1:37:37] you go do it anyway and David's our
[1:37:42] temptation he would look from his
[1:37:45] rooftop over at his neighbor's house his
[1:37:49] neighbor was away fighting Israel's
[1:37:53] balance and as a king they had forbid
[1:37:57] him to come into battle because in a
[1:37:59] battle he'd almost lost his life and
[1:38:02] said you're too valuable to go in battle
[1:38:04] anymore you stay at home will lead the
[1:38:06] battle and there you Uriah was so he was
[1:38:12] gone away in battle and that in a moment
[1:38:16] as David stood up on his rooftop looking
[1:38:20] over the city he sees a woman in her
[1:38:23] private chambers there who is bathing
[1:38:27] and as he looks upon her he looked past
[1:38:32] his River the boo
[1:38:35] he looked past the fans on his arms he
[1:38:39] look past the prevalence in his eyes
[1:38:42] he'll pass the scriptures on his
[1:38:45] doorpost and he sit for Bathsheba
[1:38:54] because in his hour there was nothing to
[1:38:59] hold him
[1:39:03] well I've memorized the scripture
[1:39:06] brother Jim I got dwelt on the promises
[1:39:10] and all of those are good but there must
[1:39:13] be an indwelling of the Holy Spirit in
[1:39:15] your life you see Moses as much as he
[1:39:19] may have desired and one of the Spirit
[1:39:21] is possession he also was only anointed
[1:39:25] he would get so anointed by the spirit
[1:39:28] and uses great gift of faith to exercise
[1:39:31] dominion over the devil in Egypt and
[1:39:34] even use the power of creation standing
[1:39:39] under the blood of bulls and goats use
[1:39:42] the power of creation to create flies
[1:39:48] somebody with me man oh my he would
[1:39:52] bring up frogs island in the blood
[1:39:56] Crawford flies take his rod and open the
[1:40:04] Red Sea take that same rod bear hard and
[1:40:09] and strike the rock and make water come
[1:40:12] from it yet one day in a temper fit you
[1:40:23] know I got an idea that that wasn't his
[1:40:26] first temper fit but during a temper fit
[1:40:34] he exalted himself when God tells him
[1:40:38] recently what to do don't speak to the
[1:40:41] rock now remember it was a type because
[1:40:44] the rock was only be smitten once
[1:40:48] representing Christ but you see Moses
[1:40:51] now with actually he would get so
[1:40:54] bigoted so in anger that's a people and
[1:40:59] he said you rev ups water out of this
[1:41:04] rock penny stock with his rod and
[1:41:08] nothing happened and he strikes again
[1:41:12] and nothing happens and he strikes and
[1:41:15] water comes and God honors it but he
[1:41:17] says okay Moses you showed yourself down
[1:41:20] tonight you exalted yourself over my
[1:41:23] word you took and show power that you
[1:41:27] were not to display you used your gift
[1:41:30] in the wrong way to exalt yourself and
[1:41:34] make yourself seem important and I'll
[1:41:36] tell you what you're not leading my
[1:41:38] people into the Promised Land that's bad
[1:41:48] but it's no different for the New
[1:41:50] Testament believers but until after
[1:41:52] Pentecost before Calvary in the coming
[1:41:56] of the Spirit you can look at the power
[1:41:58] of the Holy Ghost on the disciples they
[1:42:03] healed the sick they cast out Devils
[1:42:05] they man they casted out by the power of
[1:42:09] God we know that Jesus said it Satan
[1:42:12] cast out Satan his kingdom divided a man
[1:42:15] they did it by the power of God during
[1:42:16] this time Peter received a revelation
[1:42:20] direct from God yet didn't have the Holy
[1:42:24] Ghost cuz it wasn't yet given it could
[1:42:28] not be given until the sacrifice died
[1:42:30] and the life of the sacrifice came back
[1:42:32] home the day of Pentecost a man you see
[1:42:37] it could not come and Tabernacle man and
[1:42:40] there's a reason for this because God
[1:42:43] and Satan cannot share the same throne
[1:42:48] in the heart
[1:42:52] are you with me
[1:42:54] he will not sit on the throne with Satan
[1:43:00] ruling also so the Oh King thin nature
[1:43:07] has to die see this is what Jesus was
[1:43:13] talking about another Kingdom coming
[1:43:17] thy kingdom come where your will will be
[1:43:20] done where in our flesh is like the word
[1:43:26] settled in heaven I know I know you know
[1:43:30] denominational Theory don't want to take
[1:43:32] you there because they deny the power
[1:43:34] thereof but I'm trying to tell you
[1:43:37] friends there is a power in the Holy
[1:43:39] Ghost where God is creating a god race a
[1:43:43] man Oh hallelujah and they're not there
[1:43:47] because they're forced into it you see
[1:44:02] it must be one or the other you can't go
[1:44:07] to heaven with sin nature you got to die
[1:44:09] you got to die out to sin you got to
[1:44:12] become a new creation and and that is
[1:44:16] the only way by the power of the Holy
[1:44:19] Ghost otherwise you're going to be a
[1:44:20] failure and you will find yourself at
[1:44:23] the time of rapture a failure now Judas
[1:44:29] believed on Jesus for a time oh yeah
[1:44:33] Judas Ascenta fide yellow Judas was
[1:44:38] given authority to cast out Devils Judas
[1:44:41] healed the sick under the power of the
[1:44:44] Holy Ghost he preached under the
[1:44:47] anointing that wasn't just him the rest
[1:44:51] of the cycles did to Peter did also but
[1:44:54] both were unconverted Judas betrayed the
[1:44:58] Lord and I'm just going to say so will
[1:45:00] you
[1:45:03] so with you you will betray him at some
[1:45:08] point without the Holy Ghost because
[1:45:15] everyone not just some of us everyone
[1:45:19] must go to Pentecost for the spirit seal
[1:45:23] because that's where Judas failed he
[1:45:28] stopped short of the upper room you see
[1:45:31] before Judas got the upper room before
[1:45:32] Pentecost he showed his colors and
[1:45:35] that's what is happening in this day
[1:45:37] that's why Judas is are showing up now
[1:45:39] they're showing their colors they never
[1:45:42] made it to the other room that may have
[1:45:44] been justified or sanctified and live
[1:45:46] the good holy life and did fine for time
[1:45:48] but at some point they're going to
[1:45:50] betray him it's just there it's it's
[1:45:54] it's unavoidable unless you get to the
[1:45:56] upper room hey man let me explain it in
[1:46:00] this way sanctification can cause the
[1:46:03] unclean spirit to come out of a person
[1:46:05] only to return if that house isn't
[1:46:09] filled with the Holy Ghost and when he
[1:46:12] comes back oftentimes he comes back with
[1:46:15] seven others worse than his fair bed
[1:46:17] than than himself seven other devils and
[1:46:19] the last state of the man is worse than
[1:46:22] the first this was Jesus in the very
[1:46:27] sacred moment in the very sacred moment
[1:46:33] of Jesus handed him the bread represent
[1:46:37] in his body think of it he gets down to
[1:46:40] the last supper he goes right down to
[1:46:47] the last the great holy gathering of the
[1:46:51] Passover with Jesus sitting at his table
[1:46:57] for taking one with the other and in the
[1:47:02] sacred moment of Jesus handing him the
[1:47:05] bread represent his body dipped in wine
[1:47:09] representing his blood Satan enters
[1:47:14] to him he waits to that moment and
[1:47:20] energy ho Judas you came so close Peters
[1:47:29] declaration was that Jesus was the
[1:47:32] Christ but that didn't bring him
[1:47:34] salvation that was that was not even a
[1:47:40] confession that Jesus had died for sin
[1:47:42] becomes a substitute he knew nothing of
[1:47:44] that Jesus had not died he was he was
[1:47:48] not converted he was still a Christ
[1:47:50] denying Kirsten P preacher until
[1:47:53] Pentecost yet Peter had a revelation
[1:47:57] from God that Jesus was the Christ Jesus
[1:48:01] said my father revealed this to you
[1:48:03] didn't get you didn't learn this from
[1:48:05] man's lesson but my father gave you this
[1:48:10] revelation even the Spirit of God came
[1:48:13] down and imparted a knowledge of
[1:48:18] Revelation to Peter that he was the
[1:48:24] Christ that Jesus was the Christ the
[1:48:27] Anointed Messiah in fact as I said he
[1:48:33] didn't have he didn't have the knowledge
[1:48:36] he's in by everybody with me he didn't
[1:48:39] have the knowledge even of what Jesus
[1:48:42] had come he knew nothing of his
[1:48:45] substitutionary death he knew nothing on
[1:48:48] the power of the blood he knew nothing
[1:48:51] Alba the substitutionary death on the
[1:48:54] cross he know nothing of Jesus as a high
[1:48:57] priest he don't even see his purpose he
[1:49:00] just knows he's the Messiah the Christ
[1:49:03] the Son of the Living God
[1:49:05] and yet when Jesus tried to tell him how
[1:49:12] that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer
[1:49:14] many things of the elders and chief
[1:49:16] priests and because and and Biggs killed
[1:49:18] and raised again on the third day Peter
[1:49:21] begins to rebuke him and Jesus said to
[1:49:25] Peter get behind me Satan
[1:49:30] thou art an offence fruit to me for thou
[1:49:34] savourest not the things that be of God
[1:49:36] but those things that be of men so can
[1:49:40] you imagine here under there 19 he says
[1:49:45] that the crisis of the Living God under
[1:49:49] a different anointing which Jesus said
[1:49:54] was Satan speaking he rebukes Jesus for
[1:50:04] the very reason he has come how is it a
[1:50:11] man could get a revelation that Jesus is
[1:50:13] a Christ the Son the Living God and yet
[1:50:17] also be used to the devil to speak
[1:50:19] against the plan of God
[1:50:20] if Peter worked miracles Peter had bold
[1:50:24] confessions he had revelations that
[1:50:27] could only come from God and then would
[1:50:30] be used to the devil to speak against
[1:50:33] the wheel and the purpose of God as many
[1:50:37] of these but let's take Martha for a
[1:50:39] moment Martha is a good woman she had a
[1:50:42] declaration at the tomb of Lazarus and
[1:50:45] as powerful as it was confessing that
[1:50:48] Jesus was the Messiah it didn't save her
[1:50:51] the nature of her lamb had not come into
[1:50:54] her she declared you a lord I believe
[1:50:57] that thou art the Christ the Son of God
[1:50:59] which had come into the world but she
[1:51:01] knew not see now his purpose his plan
[1:51:05] and his redemption the woman at the well
[1:51:09] who said come and see a man didn't bring
[1:51:11] her full and complete salvation does she
[1:51:13] recognize him to be the Messiah
[1:51:16] redemption was not complete until Jesus
[1:51:18] died on the cross and paid for simms
[1:51:22] price and rose from the dead and
[1:51:24] ascended on high and took the role of
[1:51:26] high priest and just as Aaron the high
[1:51:31] priest took the blood of the atonement
[1:51:33] into the presence of
[1:51:35] the holiest of holies so Jesus would
[1:51:38] take his own black in through the
[1:51:40] heavens of heavens were God blouse the
[1:51:44] matter with me
[1:51:45] a man in Denny sent back that nature for
[1:51:49] the blood upon a hundred and twenty men
[1:51:53] and women in the Upper Room at Pentecost
[1:51:55] and they were sealed with the sight of
[1:51:58] Jesus their sacrifice through salvation
[1:52:05] the others are anointing but you want to
[1:52:12] be possessed where he abides with you
[1:52:16] for ever
[1:52:18] [Music]
[1:52:20] before this the disciples cast out
[1:52:23] Devils he did miracles using the
[1:52:24] authority of Jesus this is why brother
[1:52:27] Brandon would say in perfect faith he
[1:52:30] said at first the disciples didn't have
[1:52:32] this perfect faith they didn't have it
[1:52:33] because they had Christ walking with Him
[1:52:35] you see he was he was he was her
[1:52:39] comforter they knew with him there oh my
[1:52:44] everything was under control you see
[1:52:47] they didn't have because they had Christ
[1:52:48] walking with them so then afterwards
[1:52:51] Christ was in them so you see it's hard
[1:52:54] then to have this perfect faith without
[1:52:57] the Holy Spirit it has to bring it and
[1:52:59] it does now you say the disciples didn't
[1:53:02] have perfect faith know they had an
[1:53:04] epileptic child there and they were
[1:53:05] trying to catch this devil out of him
[1:53:07] and they couldn't do it until Jesus come
[1:53:10] and brother branham explains that he
[1:53:12] said you see if the comforter was
[1:53:15] dwelling with them but not in them so
[1:53:25] there they were away from Jesus and
[1:53:27] there was something there was something
[1:53:30] their faith dropped their confidence
[1:53:35] even in their calling their Commission
[1:53:38] dropped but because when Jesus came he
[1:53:43] took authority over that thing and said
[1:53:44] thou evil spirit come out of the man a
[1:53:47] man but it was impossible you see for
[1:53:50] them to have the Holy Spirit of body
[1:53:52] with them at all times because he came
[1:53:55] and went let's go to this for a moment
[1:53:58] let's look at an Old Testament prophecy
[1:54:01] that speaks of the abiding presence
[1:54:04] Ezekiel 36 25 then I will sprinkle clean
[1:54:07] water upon you and used to be clean from
[1:54:09] all your filthiness from your idols will
[1:54:11] I cleanse you a new heart also will I
[1:54:14] give you that's a new desire I want to
[1:54:16] do right a new spirit you know a new
[1:54:19] consciousness of what's right and wrong
[1:54:21] I will put in you and I would take the
[1:54:23] stony heart out of your flesh and I'll
[1:54:25] give you a heart of flesh
[1:54:26] and I'll put my spirit within you and
[1:54:33] look now and he will cause you to do
[1:54:39] what you couldn't have done on your own
[1:54:42] he will cause you to walk in my statutes
[1:54:45] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[1:54:50] them and you said well in this land of
[1:54:55] the Holy Ghost that I have given your
[1:54:57] father's and ye shall be my people and I
[1:55:00] will be your God hallelujah don't you
[1:55:05] want to be his people this morning don't
[1:55:07] you want for him to be your God a man
[1:55:15] told chapter 2 verse 28 and it shall
[1:55:17] come to pass out words that I will pour
[1:55:20] out my spirit upon all flesh and your
[1:55:23] sons and daughters shall prophesy and
[1:55:26] your old men shall dream dreams your
[1:55:27] young men shall see visions and also
[1:55:30] upon the servants and upon the hands
[1:55:31] made and those days will I pour out my
[1:55:34] spirit
[1:55:34] oh what a promise that is it in this
[1:55:39] land there's a pouring out of the Spirit
[1:55:42] amen in this land the Spirit the Holy
[1:55:45] Ghost is not just in Jesus it's in you
[1:55:49] indeed it does not just plow and heav'n
[1:55:51] deity dwells in you and this land he
[1:55:55] pours in deep sea vessels who clean
[1:55:58] herself out presence
[1:56:04] oh what a promise a man but before the
[1:56:12] Holy Ghost came men and women could be
[1:56:14] in dwelled with their body you know they
[1:56:17] they could not be indwelt by the
[1:56:19] embodied by biting presence and Spirit
[1:56:21] of God but you see there would have to
[1:56:27] come someone because Abraham couldn't
[1:56:32] impart this abiding presence
[1:56:37] Samson couldn't impart his anointing to
[1:56:41] stay with you none of them could give
[1:56:44] you that Samson could he bad pass it on
[1:56:49] to his offspring are you with me a
[1:56:52] member they would have to come another
[1:56:54] one from this new race would be born and
[1:56:59] he would be called the firstborn of many
[1:57:03] brethren hallelujah and his design was
[1:57:09] to bring many sons unto glory I want you
[1:57:15] to know it wasn't just Jesus that would
[1:57:18] have the abiding presence but he decided
[1:57:21] that he would have sons
[1:57:25] he would have jars that it is wounding
[1:57:29] for our transgressions and it's bruising
[1:57:32] for our iniquity amen and him taking the
[1:57:35] weapons for peace bruising him he would
[1:57:44] seek his seed hallelujah through his
[1:57:49] death so he has a torment they would see
[1:57:53] a seed that would be a seed I don't know
[1:57:58] you what am I trying to tell you there's
[1:58:00] not to be just one Jesus but what they
[1:58:03] saw
[1:58:04] what the devil saw that morning in the
[1:58:06] upper room about the third hour of the
[1:58:09] day and here come men and women drunken
[1:58:12] empowered by spirit that he never seen
[1:58:15] as noisy like this look all different no
[1:58:18] he doesn't comment
[1:58:25] [Applause]
[1:58:33] [Applause]
[1:58:36] they look like the virgin-born
[1:58:40] how could this be you see before
[1:58:49] Pentecost as we've been laboring the
[1:58:53] spirit was not yet given because it was
[1:58:56] an atonement needed to cleanse man to
[1:59:00] clean out the fire baptism to burn outs
[1:59:04] in nature and it was not yet made it
[1:59:09] couldn't it was not yet released back to
[1:59:12] the church and John 7:38 he said he that
[1:59:18] believeth on me as the scripture has
[1:59:19] said out of his innermost being shall
[1:59:23] flow rivers of living water this he
[1:59:27] spake of the Spirit which they that
[1:59:29] believe should receive for the Holy
[1:59:32] Ghost was not yet given because Jesus
[1:59:34] was not glorified so Jesus is saying
[1:59:38] that's coming forth men and women who
[1:59:41] when their heart is turned from unbelief
[1:59:44] to faith then out of their innermost
[1:59:47] beings there will be rivers rivers of
[1:59:54] the Spirit
[1:59:56] gushing out hallelujah God sick bored
[2:00:01] with life amen and and there would not
[2:00:06] be an external anointing somebody help
[2:00:10] me preach now it would not be an
[2:00:12] external annoying him but the Spirit in
[2:00:15] dwelling
[2:00:16] would flower hallelujah it would float I
[2:00:22] want you to understand it flows it's a
[2:00:24] river its river to the holy spirit of
[2:00:49] promise hallelujah amen so that heart of
[2:00:54] their innermost being with flow love and
[2:00:56] joy and peace have long suffered
[2:00:59] goodness and faith but but this would
[2:01:01] only come from those whose flesh and
[2:01:05] it's affection and lust are crucified
[2:01:08] and sin nature dead how could this be
[2:01:17] how could it be that Adam has a spirit
[2:01:20] man could not fall until he become flesh
[2:01:23] he didn't fall in the spirit he fell
[2:01:26] when it became flesh and then because of
[2:01:29] his flesh he sinned transgressing God's
[2:01:31] commandments and so God in his
[2:01:36] condescending you know and Adam coming
[2:01:39] from from their the upper realms of the
[2:01:42] heavens down to the earth that spirit
[2:01:44] man to earth and come into the flesh God
[2:01:46] would do the same thing for redemption
[2:01:48] purposes God would come to sin from the
[2:01:52] from the heavens of heaven what would be
[2:01:55] spirit and as spirit he could not suffer
[2:01:58] in this spirit he could not die and
[2:02:00] suffer he could not suffer pain he could
[2:02:03] not be tempted but God would now come
[2:02:06] and move from that into the oppan II
[2:02:09] which we call word and through the word
[2:02:12] he would create all things are you with
[2:02:16] me
[2:02:16] a man and then from the oppan II and
[2:02:19] spirit word he would come in the flesh
[2:02:24] hallelujah God condescending
[2:02:26] now into a form that can be tinted can
[2:02:30] be tried a man can experience the wrong
[2:02:35] thoughts come on
[2:02:39] a man can be tempted by the devil's loss
[2:02:43] and win and win and win this is the
[2:02:54] captain of our salvation now God had him
[2:03:01] in himself attributes of Savior healer
[2:03:04] Redeemer but he couldn't make men fall
[2:03:07] but he could put man in flesh knowing
[2:03:10] that he would fall and set me
[2:03:13] before him as I said God doesn't want us
[2:03:15] to make us robots where we couldn't be
[2:03:17] robots if we were in his image a man he
[2:03:22] didn't want just angels say holy holy
[2:03:24] holy he wanted men and women who would
[2:03:27] surrender their own self and come back
[2:03:29] to him and love him God as we looked as
[2:03:36] we looked at in the beginning Adam
[2:03:38] walked by the spirit he ruled by the
[2:03:40] spirit he moved trees about the spirit
[2:03:42] but in flesh for him here he had he had
[2:03:45] the free moral agency or the free willed
[2:03:48] he could choose death and Eve be called
[2:03:53] by the serpent who promise you won't
[2:03:56] surely die she exalted her fleshly
[2:04:01] desires over God's words and Adam in
[2:04:05] that moment he he particular the same
[2:04:07] not being deceived the Bible said but
[2:04:11] willingly went out of God's presence
[2:04:14] with her but what this did it didn't
[2:04:19] change God and man it made God come down
[2:04:23] in his condescension from tossed to low
[2:04:26] cost to theophany by which he created
[2:04:29] all things and become as flesh so he
[2:04:34] could take on the sins of man
[2:04:37] hallelujah and this is why the Bible
[2:04:40] would say greatest mystery of godliness
[2:04:43] for God was manifested in the flesh and
[2:04:48] in humans 2 and 9 but we see Jesus who
[2:04:51] has made a little lower than the Angels
[2:04:53] for the suffering of death crowned with
[2:04:56] glory and honor that he by the grace of
[2:04:59] God should taste death for every man so
[2:05:04] God took home flesh so he could pay for
[2:05:06] men's sins the one without sin took on
[2:05:11] the dust of the earth and step down into
[2:05:13] flesh for this God would not borrow
[2:05:17] timbers from anyone he used not to seed
[2:05:21] a man nor the egg of a woman he took a
[2:05:26] virgin girl who knew not a man and
[2:05:30] overshadowed her with his glory similar
[2:05:33] to what happened on Mount
[2:05:34] Transfiguration and the Holy One that
[2:05:37] was conceived in her was of the Holy
[2:05:40] Ghost he was not a Jew and he was in a
[2:05:44] Gentile he was not born of Adam's race
[2:05:48] if he was he would have been cursed to
[2:05:53] death and under sins bondage with sin
[2:05:56] nature already in him but he instead was
[2:06:00] a brand-new species
[2:06:03] hallelujah amen forth and from him would
[2:06:07] come a new race and they would not be
[2:06:11] the sons of Adam but they would be the
[2:06:14] sons of God
[2:06:16] which the bard listen to the scripture
[2:06:19] was a born not of blood nor the will of
[2:06:22] flesh nor the will of man but of God
[2:06:30] brother Branham would describe this and
[2:06:32] proven his word he said as God came down
[2:06:35] in this little cell he began to develop
[2:06:39] cells and drew from his mother's
[2:06:41] vitamins and then when he become an old
[2:06:44] enough to eat for himself he began to
[2:06:47] eat and what was it it was the dust of
[2:06:50] the earth which he become as he come and
[2:06:53] went would you come up and plant life in
[2:06:55] animal life and so forth he began to eat
[2:06:57] the feasts the bread there's silver they
[2:06:59] begin to develop cells and then when it
[2:07:02] was fully matured at thirty years old he
[2:07:05] was baptized in obedience to John down
[2:07:08] here or to go to God and rather in the
[2:07:11] water and went out and what happened the
[2:07:14] Dove which was God descending from
[2:07:16] heaven with a voice saying this is my
[2:07:19] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[2:07:22] see what did he come to do to redeem
[2:07:26] that part of the earth and he was the
[2:07:30] beginning of the creation of God because
[2:07:34] God is not a creation only in Christ he
[2:07:36] is a creation because God is eternal and
[2:07:39] the spirit and the spirit cannot be
[2:07:41] created and he was the beginning of the
[2:07:44] creation of God and God redeemed that
[2:07:47] body and when he came down he said this
[2:07:51] is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[2:07:55] pleased because he was coming to dwell
[2:08:00] in that vessel in the future home
[2:08:04] brother Branham would explain it this
[2:08:06] way that when he got out of the water
[2:08:07] John said I saw heavens open and the
[2:08:11] prophet saw and said the heavens open
[2:08:13] and here come descending out of heaven a
[2:08:15] form of a dove and a voice in this is my
[2:08:19] part of the earth that I have redeemed
[2:08:21] and from this part of the earth I will
[2:08:24] redeem the rest of it for he is my word
[2:08:27] made manifest hallelujah can you imagine
[2:08:31] what God did here the ground was crushed
[2:08:35] for Adams sake every man born all the
[2:08:39] death was cursed because of Alan come on
[2:08:43] somebody everything come under the curse
[2:08:46] of sin but well hallelujah there was one
[2:08:50] that was conceived of the Holy Ghost and
[2:08:53] there with that little blood sail on the
[2:08:56] inside begin to gather dust around him
[2:08:59] can I say it to you curse dirt earth
[2:09:04] that had been cursed and begin to wrap
[2:09:08] around of the sails the flood make the
[2:09:12] flesh of Jesus Christ and oh what a
[2:09:16] victory it must have been that day when
[2:09:19] Jesus the obedient son who didn't sell
[2:09:25] out like Adam but the obedient son
[2:09:28] brought us down to the river of Jordan
[2:09:34] to be baptized a man and the Spirit of
[2:09:40] God came and filled it and he said for
[2:09:44] this one I'm gonna redeem all the rest
[2:09:48] up up
[2:09:50] [Applause]
[2:10:00] there's going to be seed dinner born
[2:10:02] there's going to be a NOS brenigan
[2:10:05] a man he sucks ears offspring I say a
[2:10:08] 754 he was seeing Isaiah 53 now so again
[2:10:15] what was it it was there at the river
[2:10:19] giant Jesus brings his own body under
[2:10:28] submission to the Father's will and word
[2:10:32] and says we must fulfill all
[2:10:36] righteousness I'm here
[2:10:39] my purpose is here to fulfill the word
[2:10:43] and you got realized that's your new
[2:10:45] birth when you're born again that's your
[2:10:49] real purpose for being here is to
[2:10:50] fulfill God's word that is written of
[2:10:53] you so in Christ God would reconcile God
[2:10:57] and man Jesus would become the god man
[2:11:01] he would he would be man so he could
[2:11:04] feel the pain experience temptation yet
[2:11:07] without sin he would die yet he would be
[2:11:10] God in that the Almighty would be
[2:11:13] resident in him he would actually say it
[2:11:18] isn't me that doeth the works it's not
[2:11:21] the flesh profiteth nothing but he said
[2:11:25] it it's him the father's that dwelleth
[2:11:27] in me
[2:11:28] she do it the world you know this is a
[2:11:31] lot of trouble that people have today
[2:11:33] they can't figure out who Jesus was
[2:11:35] prayin to a man like like he you know
[2:11:39] that we got one you know Trinity wants
[2:11:41] to put everything three beans three
[2:11:43] persons equal in power and authority and
[2:11:46] yet Jesus is one God praying to another
[2:11:50] God one person praying to another when
[2:11:52] and when you pray to another you're
[2:11:54] showing inferior and asking for help
[2:11:58] when all three of you are supposed to be
[2:12:00] equal in power and equal
[2:12:03] come on hey man
[2:12:06] but but what but but what was it a man
[2:12:10] it was that God had became flesh and the
[2:12:15] flesh of Jesus was mad but within him
[2:12:19] 12d turtle god hallelujah
[2:12:23] a man I you know I as I looked in the
[2:12:26] scripture today you know the Bible tells
[2:12:29] you that Jesus is a man he would get
[2:12:32] hungry Jesus is a man he would age Jesus
[2:12:36] as a man somebody with me Jesus as a man
[2:12:40] but you would get tired and weary he'd
[2:12:43] get so exhausted from his healing
[2:12:46] campaigns and preaching till he'd fall
[2:12:48] asleep on the boat and a big storm
[2:12:50] rocking him around only just made him
[2:12:53] sleep like a baby until they finally
[2:12:55] woke him up and yet the Bible said he
[2:12:59] that watches over Israel neither
[2:13:01] slumbers or sleeps because he was as a
[2:13:09] man but yet he was God there at the
[2:13:14] River Jordan he brought his flesh that
[2:13:16] body of Claim willingly will bade the
[2:13:18] word of God to be baptized of John and
[2:13:22] this man this man this man who didn't do
[2:13:27] like a Adam did who sold it out this man
[2:13:31] brings his flesh right down to the river
[2:13:33] of Jordan to be baptized in obedience as
[2:13:38] a lamb surrendered himself to the
[2:13:41] father's will and the Holy Spirit is so
[2:13:44] pleased he comes and abides with him and
[2:13:48] remains now when Jesus was tempted with
[2:13:53] offers of power with obeying the devil
[2:13:57] was Satan offering him kingdoms the
[2:14:02] Bible doesn't say he fell to any of
[2:14:04] these offers or to this temptation and
[2:14:07] that the devil overtook him this is what
[2:14:10] it says when it's all done when he's
[2:14:13] tried on all points
[2:14:14] I want you to notice the leaves and
[2:15:00] angels are welcome what was God doing
[2:15:06] God was bringing a cure for sin oh I
[2:15:11] thought I would get a lot further than I
[2:15:12] am today and I'm not stopping yet but
[2:15:16] I'm probably going to have to stop on a
[2:15:18] point or two here in a few moments but
[2:15:21] let me just say God was bringing a cure
[2:15:26] for sin man found in our day in our hour
[2:15:31] you know man was subject to a lot of
[2:15:33] things you know Europeans for years and
[2:15:36] years and years lived under the scourge
[2:15:37] of smallpox they brought it over to
[2:15:44] America and American Indians had never
[2:15:47] experienced white man diseases so they
[2:15:50] had no antibodies built up in their
[2:15:52] blood from years of fighting it and
[2:15:54] millions of them died absolutely man
[2:16:02] long if we could just get something done
[2:16:06] there was a man there was a man that
[2:16:11] began to study and begin to think
[2:16:14] actually this man would become
[2:16:16] persecuted he would actually be driven
[2:16:19] out of cities because people were scared
[2:16:23] of what he was doing he would actually
[2:16:27] take
[2:16:28] virus a type of a virus then and he
[2:16:33] would inoculate children his servant his
[2:16:36] own self
[2:16:37] he'd inoculate you know and there would
[2:16:40] be as science would progress they would
[2:16:43] use horses and guinea pigs and monkeys
[2:16:46] and all kinds of animals to produce
[2:16:50] antibodies for disease but man was under
[2:16:56] a worse disease of smallpox amen
[2:17:00] smallpox is a is a killer small Paul it
[2:17:03] pops is a de former I mean the children
[2:17:06] it would get smallpox would be the left
[2:17:08] mark for the rest of their life
[2:17:12] sometimes hideously marred in their face
[2:17:14] and their eyes and everything else
[2:17:17] sometimes blinded from the disease but
[2:17:22] you see there was a worse disease and
[2:17:24] smallpox it was called sin disease a man
[2:17:31] and and so man tried everything that he
[2:17:35] could to find a cure for that disease
[2:17:38] and David you use all the remedies that
[2:17:41] that had been given you know the fallen
[2:17:45] trees there the ribbons the the things
[2:17:50] have for the frontlets before there are
[2:17:52] everything that you can imagine to you
[2:17:54] know to keep them young people would do
[2:17:56] that under smallpox they would wear
[2:17:59] certain magic stones or certain things
[2:18:02] and hope you know that this would keep
[2:18:04] the disease from them and their family
[2:18:07] only to get it man was an awful shape
[2:18:16] you know Israel wanted Messiah to save
[2:18:19] them from Rome but they needed a greater
[2:18:22] Messiah than just our greater salvation
[2:18:26] than just saving from the tyranny of
[2:18:28] Rome they needed a salvation from the
[2:18:32] journey of sin
[2:18:35] and man was in a dire straight but God
[2:18:43] had sent prophets down to the aegis
[2:18:46] worked his Holy Spirit did miracles and
[2:18:50] signs and great things but none of it
[2:18:53] produced a sin killer but one day God
[2:18:58] comes down himself and takes on the robe
[2:19:02] of humanity and he didn't or is somebody
[2:19:07] with me and then he didn't just let
[2:19:10] death come and and I you know hit a
[2:19:13] horse or here to get a pig but he went
[2:19:18] to the cross himself and Darian is rush
[2:19:23] he took the penalty of sin and he left
[2:19:28] said anchor it's finger at him oh that
[2:19:35] was an awful day for hell I member
[2:19:39] caasie that big tree over profits it had
[2:19:42] victory over the sages in that victory
[2:19:45] over grape man but this day sin lost its
[2:19:48] victory
[2:19:51] hallelujah and Paul could stream
[2:19:54] Arbogast
[2:19:55] where is fasting brave where is our
[2:20:00] victory
[2:20:01] thanks be to God that's been our
[2:20:04] Redeemer he gave us the victory through
[2:20:08] our Lord Jesus Christ so God did not
[2:20:15] listen God did not allow somebody else
[2:20:20] for it to happen he came down and took
[2:20:24] on sin himself hallelujah amen and
[2:20:31] through his bud he produced an antibody
[2:20:36] a sin cure a man and when the Holy Ghost
[2:20:42] came down about Jesus at the day of his
[2:20:44] baptism Jesus was inoculated hallelujah
[2:20:50] and when the devil tried to give him all
[2:20:51] the world the kingdoms of the world what
[2:20:54] did you he stay right straight with the
[2:20:56] word why he was inoculated a man the
[2:21:00] Spirit of God didn't leave him in the
[2:21:02] hour temptation the seal held or we held
[2:21:05] him when Satan trimmed it it was women
[2:21:07] it held when Satan tempted him with
[2:21:10] Kingdom the inoculation held a man with
[2:21:13] said to Satan crippling him with
[2:21:15] compromise and with prestige nothing
[2:21:18] worked
[2:21:18] everything that devil told at him
[2:21:21] nothing work turned popular opinion
[2:21:24] against it it didn't work talk about the
[2:21:27] church against him in the fire season
[2:21:28] decide to see he did work he turned
[2:21:31] friends against them
[2:21:32] and his own people betray him and that
[2:21:34] didn't work but they're not ulation held
[2:21:39] whenever friend forsook him finally they
[2:21:42] knew he was a prophet and Romans the
[2:21:46] Romans soldiers put a rather on his head
[2:21:49] closes I'd took a stick beat him on the
[2:21:52] head with one hand and then say now if
[2:21:55] your prophet tell us who hit you will
[2:21:57] believe you but the knock ulation hell
[2:22:00] he wasn't clowning for the devil
[2:22:03] didn't mind the devil he said I only do
[2:22:05] what the father shows me to do
[2:22:07] amen approved the inoculation held the
[2:22:11] devil's oh well I got him now so he
[2:22:13] starts him at Calvary ho that's a
[2:22:15] mistake man he falls right into the trap

[2:22:22] get death to sting him this one hey like
[2:22:27] any of the other this is a virgin born
[2:22:30] son of God filled with the Holy Ghost

[2:29:21] the kingdom when you come in this land
[2:29:24] maybe there's a new king that's a new

[2:32:15] hallelujah let's bow our heads together
[2:32:24] while we have our head bowed just for a
[2:32:27] moment while we talk it over with him

[2:32:40] come burned down in your life and burned
[2:32:45] out sin nature are you trying to have
