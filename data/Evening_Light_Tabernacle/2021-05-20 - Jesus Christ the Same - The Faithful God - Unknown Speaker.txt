and done for your glory and for your honor in jesus name amen amen turn to hebrews 13 and verse 8. amen jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen we'll let you be seated so we've been looking at this thought on jesus christ the same like to speak to you this evening on jesus christ the same the faithful god a faithful god the same meaning again identical or unchanged the same we're thankful that we serve a god who is the same i'm thankful that today when i woke up this morning that he wasn't a different god or had a different idea or a different viewpoint but he's still the same god and that's it gives us stability to a christian life really that's what gives us all of our stability is he's the same amen he's the same as we said last wednesday in every detail he's the same in every in his word what he said before is what he is today so we can look in in this word and we can find and we can begin to look and see as he was yesterday so he is today you know as he was with israel the physical sea so he is with spiritual israel the spiritual seed amen he saved himself a namesake then he'll save himself a namesake now he delivered them then he will deliver them now he healed them then he will heal now amen he was faithful then he is faithful now amen i want to look at deuteronomy 7 and verse six and and this scripture is one of my one of my favorite scriptures to read it says for thou art a holy people unto the lord thy god the lord thy god has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are on the face of the earth now the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more than number than any people for he were the fewest of all people so he's telling them that i didn't choose you because of you i chose you because of my heart and my thought towards you amen and and god had this thought of israel this thought of them before the foundation of the world and he came to them in a time that this seemed like they wouldn't they wasn't qualified to be a chosen people they were slaves they were bound in egypt they were down in egypt but he came them to show them love amen because he's faithful and he would tell them this he said but because the lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers has the lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of the bondman from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt know therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god amen the faithful god which keepeth covenants and mercy with him that he loves and keeps his commandments to a thousand generations faithful is not just what god does it is what god is faithful is being steadfast it's being unwavering it's being firm it's being constant faithful is being dependable it's being determined it's devoted it's committed he's faithful to his word therefore he is determined to see his word fulfilled he is faithful to his people therefore he is determined to see them saved oh hallelujah he's faithful to us amen as his children therefore he is determined to see his word fulfilled for their healing for their deliverance amen for everything that they have need of you say well tonight i'm sick well you serve a faithful god you say tonight i need deliverance will you serve a faithful god amen a god who is not determined to depend upon the earth's governments or the earth's atmospheres or the earth's uh the where you are or what you're in or what condition you're in that does not depe that has no determination on god whatsoever but even in your worst times god is faithful and your worst sickness god is faithful and your worst problems god is faithful amen so he is determined to see every scripture fulfilled therefore he would say not a dot not a tittle will fall to the ground but every one of it every part of it will be fulfilled so when you read your bible you can believe it's going to be fulfilled if it hasn't been already god is going to fulfill every part of his word and he would say this in numbers 23 and verse 19 he would say god is not a man that he would lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and hath he said it and shall he not do it or what he has said he shall do or what he has spoken he shall make it good amen he makes every promise good and he is determined that his word will not fail but just as determined as he is to see his word not fail he's determined to see his bride not fail he's re he's determined to see that you not fail he's determined that his healing will be there for you in your time of need he has determined that his salvation will be there even when you don't know you need saving even when you don't know you need god god is still faithful amen and we could see it in abraham as he called him by election by sovereign grace and the covenant that he gave to abraham was completely and wholly unconditional unconditional he made it he didn't make any conditions at all about it and that's the same covenant you have tonight so your covenant is not dependent on how good you are how great you are he didn't choose you because you were great he chose you to make you great he didn't choose you to call it typical because you were worthy he chose you to make you worthy he didn't choose you because you was without sin he chose you that you would be blameless and so god has determined amen that these will be fulfilled in man god is determined to save man that makes me want to shout because in the darkest hour there's ever been god has not lost that determination god is still determined as he's ever been to save somebody he's still determined as he's ever been to heal somebody he's still determined as he's ever been to lift them up out of the mirror clay and to put them upon a rock god is still determined but there's been you know two covenants one was given to abraham or to adam if you will i will and it was broke but the abrahamic covenant was given to abraham and it was not if you will i will it was i have i've already done it i i have done it not i will do i have done it god is determined to save man therefore he made a covenant if you will i will he broke it but he come around and said it's not what you do it's what i've already done man can't keep his covenant but god will always keep his covenant man cannot keep his promises we can see that how many promises have been broken even today amen man cannot keep them but god has never broken promise even dealing with israel and he would tell them if you don't heed the word of god and you'll you'll go into slave go right back to where you came from and that's exactly what he would say but he said i will bring you out again and that's exactly what he did and he kept over and over why because he was determined to have a seed he was determined to have a people he was determined to have sons and daughters amen but how much more if he was determined over the physical seed how much more is he determined over the spiritual seed of abraham i am determined to have children i am determined to have sons i am determined to have daughters and the devil can do what he wants to but my word will not fail [Music] man can't keep a covenant but god keeps his every time man can't keep his promises but god keeps it every time amen it's it isn't because you do something it's because god did something amen you're not here tonight because you did something you're here tonight because god did something you're not saved tonight because you did something you're saved tonight because god did something amen it isn't it's not that you chose god it's god chose you hallelujah amen you know even god is determined listen to this this is another determination of god he said when invitations was given at the marriage there the parable in the in the new testament excuses were made and back they come and said well they won't come this one done that this one got that he said listen at the last time he sent them out he said go to the hedges and the highways and the byways get the lame the halt the blind and compel them to come he said why did god do that for god is determined that his table will be set and there will be somebody there oh hallelujah god wants his table full therefore he's determined whatever i've got to do i'm going to have somebody there i if i got to get them from the highways if i got to go to the byways if i got to go to the lowest to the lowest wherever i've got to go i am determined that my word will not fail we ought to be thankful tonight we have a god who's determined where would you be if he wasn't determined amen if he was just not determined to save you and the first slip up you made or the second or the tenth or however many chances you got amen he could have just gave up on you and walked away and said well i'll find me somebody else but god was determined and he said i'll do whatever i got to because that is my son there that is my daughter there i'll defeat every devil i'll break every barrier i'll tear down every stronghold whatever i got to do that's my son i'm tonight thankful that god is determined he said my i said god's people acts many times odd and peculiar no way they act strange why because they're not tied up with affairs of this world they're dead and buried in christ and raised up a new life to be the first fruits of them that enjoy the spiritual resurrection he said that's the holy spirit would flow through every member and would show forth the glory of god like god showed egypt when he brought the vine out he said but there is a wild vine now just bear with me for a second he said there is a wild vine the bible speaks of it in second kings about remember the story about the pottage and they wouldn't gathered it out and there was death in the pot he said but brother there is a wild vine growing it grows around creeds and denominationals denominational spirits he said when it gets out there it shuts off all the spiritual joy and the first thing you know that vine is dead but god is determined that his vine won't die oh hallelujah he showed his determination all the way down to the dark ages the vine that started there and it went through jesus to the life of uh and it broke out in the holy ghost of the day of pentecost went to the disciples and then down to the second age and the third age and it looks like the devil's doing everything he can to put it out and bringing up the ecclesiastical moves and all the things that were taking place and the and the and the outright trying to put the light out but god was determined hallelujah and god's determined to have church tonight whether you want to or not amen god is determined to go beyond our darkness to go beyond our fears to go beyond the things that we're going through all the things god is determined to break through he said i will have a church i will have a vine the devil can try to put creeds the devil can try to put dominance upon it but what does god do he fills it with the holy ghost amen and it comes down in jesus christ's name and that church begins to pulsate why because he's faithful it begins to feel the presence of the living god why he's faithful it begins to watch him move and heal the sick why because he's faithful oh hallelujah praise the lord psalms 37 23 says it like this it says the steps of a good man or a righteous man are ordered by the lord in other words he's not going to tell you what to do and then leave you to it if you would if you look into this it's ordered by the lord in other words the lord's going to go with you in your steps and he delighteth in his way and though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down oh hallelujah that's not the end of the story because god's determined and god's faithful and the lord upholdeth him with his hand he says i've been young and now i'm old yet i've never seen the righteous forsaken nor seed begging bed why because god is faithful he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed why because god is faithful hebrews 11 11 says it like this and here's a key to this through faith also sarah herself received strength to concede seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age why because she judged him faithful not herself faithful not herself any good well i've been doing pretty good i've listened to so many tapes i've read my that's not what it's all about yes part of it but that's not what it's all about it's judging him faithful he made the promise he'll bring it to pass hallelujah he promised healing to my body it wasn't i promise that he promised it it wasn't a preacher promise that he promised it it wasn't it wasn't a pope that promised it or even a prophet that promised it he promised it so therefore you got to take your eyes off of your in your humanity and what you've done wrong and what you said and how you laughed laughed when he said he was going to have a child and he said there's nowhere it could be me but god was determined he said i'm going to have a son i'm going to it's going to come through abraham and it's going to come through sarah and it does not matter about it if she laughs i'm still going to have it and she began to turn her eyes off of her in insignificant things and her humanity and her spirit that she was all the mood that was she in and she began to look at him she said that god's faithful it's time some of you get your eyes off your own humanity or the humanity around you or or the other world around you and the things around you and the spirits around you and the chaos around you and the atmospheres around you and the problems around you and this all the situations that seemingly are unending around you and get your eyes and start looking to him and say he's faithful how many can say that tonight how many can say lord i judge you faithful this judge is actually i i steam him i put him in the place he belongs that he's faithful i i consider him faithful even when i haven't been faithful he's faithful hallelujah even when i've been in my doubt he's still faithful even when i've been in my fear and wear worry he's still faithful even when i've been thinking about quitting he's still faithful [Applause] and from that they're spraying they're even one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and multitude as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable he said he got scripture for that brother timothy that when we're not faithful he is faithful yep dear second timothy 2 and verse 13. if we believe not yet he abideth faithful hallelujah or that's what i mean if we believe not or if we are faithless he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself oh hallelujah so even when you're not even faithful and you're faithless and you can't even believe the promises for yourself he's still faithful even when you cannot grasp a hold of it and give it for your own he's still faithful even when it seems like it escapes you every time and it's been year after year month after month day after day however long it's been you've been in this battle you've been anything i'm just losing faith i'm giving up he's still faithful [Applause] he's not removed himself from your battle he's still in the middle of it he's not removed himself from your steps he's ordered your steps he's brought you to this place to show you i am faithful [Applause] he cannot deny himself he said well brother timothy i got sin what about my sin okay first john 1 9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness jesus christ the same the faithful god he would show himself faithful all the way through the old testament i mean go try to find out where he wasn't faithful try to find out where he wasn't there when they had need of him they called on him and they asked him to forgive their sins and he forgive them mercy after mercy after mercy extended and that's why paul would even speak it be able to pick it up and he said we serve a god who's rich in mercy why because he could look at all the mercy that that god the great jehovah had given the children of israel and it brought them through all kind of things and they would forsake him and they would serve other gods and he would he would let the enemy come and they would cry out god forgive us and his mercy he was still faithful he was still calm and he would still move on the scene and break down the bars and the walls and set his people free and they'd go right back again and do the same thing and he would do it all over again why because he was faithful that's why even now i still have hope for those that have walked away from him that i know god's still faithful all i got to say is god i'm sorry and god to be there for them because he's faithful he showed himself all the way through the old testament time after time after time after time a faithful god he would show it in abraham's life when abraham would be put to the test and he would be sent up there on the mountain to sacrifice his son and he went he just went according to god's word because he knew god made the promise and there he judged him faithful he's like hey if god told me to take my son he must have a plan he's going to raise him up again because he said through this side through isaac my seed shall be and so he takes him upon a mountain to sacrifice him but god was looking at abraham and when he went to draw back the sword he said abraham it's not what you will i will and he had a lamb a ram over in the bush why because god was faithful amen god would come time after time noah's life he was faithful [Music] noah found grace in the eyes of the lord and god showed faithfulness to noah and his whole household to get him out of the whole situation that was about to come upon the earth why because god's faithful we heard about his sunday about them saving even saving the uh israel out of egypt and all the things that took place incredible show of god's faithfulness god didn't lead him out of egypt to leave him there to die in the wilderness no matter how much their faithless heart said so he didn't do it he brought him out to show his power because he's faithful he would come all the way down why would david step out into the into the valley with a giant many times his size many times his strength but there administered on it so wonderfully here a couple wednesdays ago at many times his abilities many times and it seemed like an impossibility but david said i'll go fight him why because he judged his god faithful and he knew the same god that saved him from a lion and from a bear he was faithful in them situations he's not lost his faithfulness today right we can see him all the way down daniel found him faithful three hebrew children found him faith and we got all kinds of examples we preached on it many times of god's faithfulness but why is it when we get to our situation we forget who he is and it comes in jesus christ in a human vessel named jesus christ god veiled in flesh crying as a baby in a manger skinning his knees as a teenager walks the shores of galilee why because he was faithful he had a seed the john 3 16 says for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son why because he's faithful he wants to see all flesh saved did you hear that that's the kind of merciful god we serve he wants to see all flesh saved i actually had started looking at this several months ago at his faithfulness and jesus the same thinking about the pool of bethesda thinking about that situation and we know the chosen just come out with that and i thought they hit some very good inspiration this this ain't even my notes but just thinking about it here jesus comes and he's trying to show this this man has been laying here for years he's been in this condition for years and he's lost faith where all he now has excuses why god has it done or why he can't get to this pool or why why nobody will take me nobody when i try to move somebody steps on me and all these excuses and that's what happens when we get into battle or we're getting something that lasts a long time and we get to the points in our lives and we get to say and we begin to doubt not just us we begin to doubt him and here he came down and he asked the man do you want to be healed or will thou be made whole do you want to be healed and the man starts giving him all of excuses and so that's not what i'm asking you i'm asking you do you want to be healed i'm asking you do you want to get out of this condition in this place and never come back here again if you'll look away from the situation you're in and the excuses and the problems and the sicknesses that's tormented you for years and years and years and you'll look at me you'll walk away from here because i am faithful i have the power to do this i have the ability to do this it's in my word and he began to look away from his excuses and he began to realize there's somebody else here this isn't somebody that just can't pick me up and and take me and dump me off in a pool somewhere this is somebody that can heal me and his thought process began to change and his look began to change and things begin to move and operate and what jesus said he said rise walk take up thy bed and walk i thought it was so wonderful how they picked up the inspiration the man said why he stood up on his feet and he said why is it important for me to take my bed and peter come and told him and said because the reason why you got to take your bed because you're not coming back here that's wonderful right there it's time some of you take your old beds of excuses and your old beds of things has held on to you for a long time rise up and walk judge them faithful and get out of that condition and say i'm not going there again i'm not going back to my complaints and my worries and my feelings i'm not looking at that i'm taking my bed and i'm walking out of here cause i'm not coming back again if you leave it there you'll go back again but he's faithful he expressed his faithfulness to the human race to forgive he expressed his faithfulness to the human race to love those who were unlovable oh we can love those who love us but he loved those who didn't love him because he was faithful he was the greatest representation of love that's ever hit the earth he was despised of those who lived on the earth to whom he loved who we come to love no man could ever love him love like him no man was ever hated like him they hated him because he was faithful they despised him because he was faithful they rejected him because he was faithful but it did not stop his love because he was faithful they laughed when he was hanging on the cross because he was faithful after that life that he had lived been done nothing but good things forgiven the guilty why because he was faithful healing the sick because he was faithful done things that were good and when he took his last breath on the cross they spit on him they mocked him they made fun of him they ripped the beard from him because he was faithful not because he deserved it he didn't deserve what he got he did it because he was faithful and he said when all of this happened he could have turned his head from the other he could have called 10 000 legions of angels to take him off the cross but he turned and looked at them with eyes of love he said father forgive them for they know now what they do why because he's faithful i can hear his voice tonight saying father forgive them for their doubt forgive them for their anxiety and their fears why because he's faithful he can understand being under being god he understands that's why he can love us when we were unlovable because he's god and he understands oh living he loved me why because he was faithful never my life lived like that it was wrapped in love dying he saved me a death like never before why because he was faithful he could he took the penalty of sin there was no one that could pay this penalty for another every man though he might die for another man but he was guilty that man was guilty to begin with but here come one that wasn't guilty and he took your sin and he took your guilt and he bore to an old rugged tree why because he's faithful hallelujah he said there was only one way for it to be paid and that was the death of god himself so god being a spirit couldn't die so he came in a body and expressed himself in a body without sin he expressed the love of god without sin he took all of the sin without sin why because he's faithful that he might take the guilt of the guilty mercy jesus all of us being sinners not a way in the world for us to be saved not in no way in the world we could come on our own we could not even come and make our own sacrifices anymore abel tried abel tried and he died others tried it and they died but here come one the faithful one the lamb of god slain before the foundation of the world come to take the place of guilty sinners mashed and bruised why because he's faithful scoffed and made fun of why because he's faithful died to death no creature could die except god himself his bloody locks hanging from his shoulders dripping to the ground express what a horrible thing that sin was and when he had to die to redeem man from the life of sin nothing else could die like that but he did it why because he's faithful he took your sins why because he's faithful he took your sickness why because he's faithful i want to keep hammered on to you tonight god is faithful he's not going to let this come down to the end of this and say i just give up and walk away no he said i'm going to have a bride without spot without wrinkle without blemish i'm going to have a table full of gas i'm going to have a people that's going to come out and be overcomers and laodicean church age therefore i'll write it in my bible because i'm that sure of it he came as a man even david would cry out 800 years before write down in the psalms my god my god why hast thou forsaken me what a terrible thing sin does separating man from god he was a sin offering that had to be offered for our suffering for our sins he was separated from the presence of god sin had separated him and god placed our sin on him and that separated him from god and that's why he cried why hast thou forsaken me he did it because he's faithful because he was forsaken and taken this place seen as people who rejected him who hated him despised him it grieved him so till he was so brokenhearted till the blood and water and chemicals of his body separated he took it man man we'll never know what that was like that's the reason there could be no one else ever die like that he said brother brown said i don't care how tormented you ever are you'll never be tormented like that he said how they might put your feet in stocks they might saw you by inches they might burn you by inches but you could not die that death because your makeup's not like that he had to be god he had to be more than a man in the makeup he died of a broken heart why because he's faithful he died with such grief why because he was faithful he died until the chemical reaction took place in his body to where he would separate water and blood why because he was faithful because he knew there was going to be somebody that was going to need it he knew there was going to be a people that was going to need those stripes for healing he knew there was going to be a people that was going to need that crown of thorns and those stripes upon his back and those nails through his hands and feet for their sins for their wrongs for their worries for their fears he knew it would be so therefore he remained faithful he remained faithful for you for me he remained faithful for ron spencer he remained faithful for brother kenny campus here tonight he remained faithful and he's not changed we serve a faithful god hanging there that precious life that knew nothing but love and doing good hanging between heaven and earth lifted up stripped naked embarrassed think how you would be stripped naked you want no embarrassment to what god would have hanging there he said i know the crucifix i have some little thing hanging there so it wasn't like that they stripped him he had a robe they tore it off and gambled before he was embarrassed to the upmost yet being god he stood and sinners spit in his face the very depths of modesty die before the public stripped naked such an effect it took on him the poet would write it like this and said men ritter mid rendering rocks and darkening skies my savior bowed his head and died but the open veil revealed the way to heaven's joys and endless days sure he had to do it the veil hung between man and god and that opening veil revealed a way to heaven's joys and endless days therefore he remained faithful therefore you could go beyond the veil you could go into that place because he was faithful calvary means something it means more than we can express that's why the poet would say it live and he loved me died he saved me buried he carried my sins far away oh it's and it said what is it sin has now been condemned why because he's faithful and therefore sin has no more hold on you why because he's faithful hallelujah sin and sickness and problems are finished how do you know they're finished because he said they was finished he screamed out it was more than just his life giving up the ghost or his life leaving his body when he's beginning to scream out in his finish it was more than speaking about his life leaving his body he knew when that life left it was going down to get those down there and then old that old grave had been buried somewhere and he's going after abraham isaac and sarah and all the patriarchs that found him faithful that judged him faithful and he knocked on the door and they began to scream here he is it's the same one i saw on the plains of memory this is the same one that revealed the secrets of my heart that's the wheel in the middle of the wheel that's the one that was in the fire with me there he is the faithful one but he didn't go down there to stay with him he go to say come on boys it's time to go home why because he was faithful therefore he knew when he said it was finished that sin's power was now broke oh hallelujah sicknesses power over a human being is now broke and it's still broke because the blood is still in effect as it's ever been therefore if it's an effect and it had healing power then and it did you can read through the book of acts in that first church age that blood had healing power it was a palsy hill it was a lame hill it was a blind hill there was every kind of sickness and halton lame healed it showed it had power there it has power now and it was at that moment cancer lost his power it was at that moment high blood pressure and sugar about diabetes and every kind of disease you want to name tonight lost its power let's just call it sickness let's just call it demons of hell they lost their power over god's people why because he's faithful he held all therefore you can now hold on so why would scream at the cross it's finished it's done sin and sickness is powerless it's lifeless he said think of that people that sin that held you for a long time is now dead and lifeless has no more effect it can't have any more effect when the blood of jesus christ is wiped over it's removed from henceforth and forevermore mercy jesus now it's dead it's buried as lifeless no more life in it that seemless lamb that knew no sin that god who knew no wrong his life given there buried he carried my sins far away but it didn't end there rising he was still faithful he justified forever oh glorious day he's moved our sins where to the sea of forgetfulness you're talking about faithfulness to where he don't even remember it no more god cannot remember it anymore because he's faithful and it's both dead and buried and it cannot even be brought back to god's memory they're out of god's memory well that ought to do something for you that devil's been trying to bring up your past remind him it's out of god's memory that's all that matters i don't care if you remember devil because your word don't matter your decree and your laws does not matter it has no jurisdiction over my life the only one who has jurisdiction over my life is jesus christ and my sins have been removed and placed in the sea of his forgetfulness and he don't remember it anymore that's all that matters hallelujah he was a lamb but he was because he was faithful he died because he was faithful he was buried because he was faithful he rose again because he was faithful but it don't end there he's coming back again because he's faithful oh hallelujah what good would have been for him to come 2000 years ago to us today if he's not coming back again for us he's coming back again for us he promised he would i think of the story of the armored girl the armored boy that went out to the west to get that girl and and she stood there on the side of the street because he told her he's going to come at a certain time and she made herself ready she got dressed and she made herself ready and went out and getting mocked at laughed at and carried on all kinds but she had enough faith in that man's words that that man told me he met me right over there at that corral and he told me he's gonna come back at this time therefore i'm gonna stand out here until he does and they made fun of her and they laughed and they said you're a bunch of crazy bunch of you're nuts you've lost your mind if anybody had come after he'd come after this one or that one or somebody else and he's going to come after little old you that's what he told me that's what he said therefore i'm going to stand here till he does because i judge his word to be faithful i don't think he was joking with me i don't think he was making fun of me he was very sincere with me when he began to reveal to me the secrets of his heart and revealed to me who i was and he told me that i was to be his wife and he said i'm coming back therefore i'm staying right here come on somebody even she has stood upon the words of a mortal man come on a mortal man that could be affected by things he could be affected by train wrecks or affected by whatever kind of things a buggy breaking down he could be affected by all kinds of stuff but she still stood there on the words of a mortal man but you're not here tonight standing on the words of a mortal man you're not here tonight at church because of the words of a mortal man you're not believing in his return because of the words of a mortal man he said he's coming back he told me the secrets of his heart he revealed to me himself and he told me who i am and he said i'm coming back at a certain time at a certain age you be ready and that's why i'm here call me what you want to call me a holy roller make fun of this church all you want to you can make fun of our worship but he said he's coming back he said he's going to be here and i'm going to remain right here until he returns [Applause] not only is your sin forgiven it's buried and remembered no more dead forever oh hallelujah rising he justified living he'd love me dying he saved me bear to carry it as my sins are far away rising he justified oh what a savior faithful he knew his word was faithful he had enough confidence in his word he said you destroy this temple in three days and i'll raise it up again because he knew that word wasn't going to return into him void but it was going to do what it promised it would do and it rose up from the dead rising he justified freely forever oh no wonder it brings emotions no wonder the human heart cannot contain it because he died and was buried and rose up again no wonder the angels in heaven sing the praises of god old testament saints and paradise shouted hallelujah the heavens shook the earth shook the paradise shook hell shook with that great voice coming forth up from the crazy road graveyard rose rising he justified freely forever and the saints that die in him can sing this when we look at that amazing grace yonder we know it's still amazing grace now that if i go down in the grave i'm going to rise up again why god has promised me he would and therefore he will do what he said he would do all sins are pardoned all sickness is broke death is defeated hell is conquered why because he's faithful because he's faithful let's read it here in psalms 119 and verse 90. brother brother timothy is he going to run out of faithfulness well let's see 119 and verse 90. that faithfulness is unto what all generations so if he was faithful in abraham's generation he's faithful in my generation if he is faithful in my daddy's generation the prophet of god's generation and he come down and showed himself faithful would raise the dead heal the sick save the lost miracles and signs and wonders he's still the same so he's faithful in all generations thou hast established the earth and it abideth so as long as this earth abides he's faithful first corinthians 10 verse 13 says there is no temptation taking you but such is common to man but god is faithful they can say that god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bury it hallelujah he won't put more sickness on you than you can handle that's what he told brother ron at the beginning he said if you'll trust me i'll use you like never before and we saw that taking place saw a dead man here i'm just talking about a doctor decreed dead man should have been dead within months almost a year right at a year later stand behind this pulpit and preach like a 30 or 40 year old like he was back then and still preaching like that does that not mean that he don't have bad days still yeah he has bad days he has sickness that comes against him as you heard even on sunday but god has been faithful and god is faithful and god has not lost one ounce of power over cancer amen but he's going to make a way of escape second thessalonians 3 3 says the lord his faithful who shall establish you and keep you from evil the lord is faithful who shall establish you and keep you from evil and he would say it here in lamentations 3 and verse 21 this i recall to my mind this i want you to recall to your mind we think about all kinds of things but recall this to your mind and if you can recall this to your mind and your trials and your situations and the things that you're going through you can have hope he says therefore have i hope it is of the lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness great in other words it's a word that means almost innumerable it's innumerable all your faithfulness story after story time after time we wouldn't even have time tonight to tell of god's faithfulness just in this church but it's to all generations it's to every heart it's to every life it's to every person and great is our faithfulness do you find him faithful tonight do you find him trustworthy tonight or in other words do you find him somebody you can put your trust in and your life in and your body in and your mind in and your spirit in and say god i don't know how i'm going to get through this but you're faithful you promised you was going to make me a way of escape and i'm looking for that moment he did it for peter we could find his faithfulness all the way through the new testament well my goodness all the things that but paul there on the ship going down he showed faithfulness in this moment when he got bit by a snake he showed faithfulness in his moment when peter was in jail and it seemed like all hope was gone and the saints began to pray he showed faithfulness in those moments he'd touch him on the side say come on peter come out of this place and you don't ever know when your touch is coming you don't know when that touch is about to happen peter maybe that was the last thing on his mind he had his soldiers on all four sides of him he was in the innermost prison he had bars all around him guards everywhere and they ain't that the angel don't pay no attention to guards or cancer or spirits or he comes right beyond all of it strongholds and bondages and walls god's never paid no attention to none of that when he decided to get his purse his child out he went and got him out it didn't matter how much the devil had covered him up it didn't matter how much the devil walled him in when god decided it was time he went and got him you don't know when your touch is coming but remain faithful keep your faith in a faithful god let's buy our hands god is faithful that even when you're faithless he's faithful even when you don't know which way is up and which way is down he's faithful even when you're about to give up he's faithful don't give up on his promise he's faithful one man tonight said lord as that man would say to jesus lord help my unbelief i want to be found faithful he said well i find faith when i return i want to be found a man of faith standing there waiting for his return looking for him just lift your hands to him just talk to the lord for a moment just a reminder that god just want to remind you tonight who he is a simple little subject god's faithful you don't know when he's going to touch you on the side and say you're out of this you're out of that cancer you're you're out of that blood pressure you're out of that situation you're out of that conflict you're out of that anxiety you're coming out of that you're out of that lawsuit you're out of all that just know he's faithful he saw it all coming before he came he knows your needs he knows your situations he knows your struggles he knows the attack on faith right now speaking with that chaplain cary the other day on the way to the graveside he said told me and brother brother tim said be praying for us he said the navy i joined is not the navy i'm in he said i told my my superior the other day my admiral i said it's no longer storm clouds there's battle lines that's been drawn there's things being implemented right now into the armed forces that'll systematically remove people of faith and he told us this statement it stuck with me said a man without faith won't fight [Music] god wants you to have faith in him so therefore he gave you something that you can believe in you may not come believe in another man you may not come believe in a government

we're unfaithful when we fail to believe and i can hear the prophet many many times say lord forgive me of my unbelief lord we think about it he prayed that way what about us so many times we stumble along the way lord we failed our faith to rise up to the level of the promise and to thank that you sent a gift in this day to raise our faith up lord so many times that's what it was all about it was we were trying to have faith we were trying to believe you sent a messenger with a message with a gift that would elevate faith and cause it to rise up to a higher level lord get when we don't believe when we couldn't believe when we somehow another couldn't grasp it you are faithful would you send gifts to us so that we could know your faithful god because we're going to have to have that knowledge judging you faithful who made the promise here we are that sarah here in the last day been a barren church a long time been waiting on the promise now for thousands of years we have reached the last age and you've been faithful to show us that we're here that we've arrived that we're here at the last days and you sent elijah the prophet when you saw we didn't have the faith we needed to turn our hearts back to believing again that's why we can believe tonight that's why we can believe that you're the same yesterday today and forever because you showed yourself that you were the faithful and true witness that has witnessed to us that you're not just god yesterday lord we sing the song tonight i know a man who can walk on the water anytime any place anywhere i know of a man who can open blind eyes lord those are not just spiritual blind eyes you can open the eyes of the physical blind i remember the day lord when you come in my room my house you the angel passed over the bed my wife had lost her sight and there lord as the holy spirit the angel of god swept over her bed her eyesight came back i remember that because you're a god who is witness to us that you're still the same that we know a man who can do this that this is a faithful god lord i'm just hear our sister phyllis rejoicing because her blind eyes have not been coming open she's been able to read her bible in the church house lord that's because you're a faithful god you understand human suffering and you oh god not just understand it and give us a handkerchief to cry with and to wipe our tears you do more than that you come by our way and heal us of diseases lord i remember that you touched the death that you stopped the ringing of the ears lord you come and move on the scene for your children you make cripples walk lord we know what you do because we've seen you do it lord we know even as we have prayed tonight for those with cancers lord there's even those that the doctors are speaking about cancer in their life lord there's our brother mickey that is here that the doctors have given him just a couple of years to live but you're the healer lord you're greater than anyone a doctor would know we remember lord it wasn't too long ago that you did the same thing for our sister lana lord you moved on the scene because you're the faithful god and when the doctors it even said the medicine itself would kill lord you did greater because you're the great god who saves us from our sickness and you you told us in this day that not even cancer would stand before our prayers that's why we can pray for this deacon there oh god in south africa that's why we can call on the name of the lord and know that it's not just empty prayers that their prayers don't just go out into thin air and dissipate as a sound wave but no it goes in the realm of the supernatural it goes in the rounds of dimensions it goes into realms were of the eternal world there is no distance and it goes to a bedside where man is in a dying condition and raises him up to serve the living god this is the kind of god that we serve and we're believing lord for your children i pray dear god that each one that you'll just meet their need tonight as they go may they go out with a real with a real determination i'm going to believe with all my heart and that faithful god he's been so faithful why should i doubt him why should i doubt why should i disbelieve but god has done so much so i would believe go with your people tonight bless them on their way home may lord as the sounds of the wheel go along may you just go over and over again saying i'm that faithful god i'm the faithful one i'm with you always i'll never leave you or forsake you i pray that you'll do it father in jesus name amen god bless you we meet together sunday in jesus name amen
