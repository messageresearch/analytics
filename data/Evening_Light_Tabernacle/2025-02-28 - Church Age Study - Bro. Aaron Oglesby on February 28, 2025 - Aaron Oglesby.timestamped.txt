[14:22] thas
[14:24] amen how many's glad to be here tonight
[14:27] amen well okay we're live
[14:31] now you know that's the challenge of the
[14:33] day you get the fire
[14:36] lit but then the spirit of the age and
[14:38] we'll see this as we look into it
[14:40] tonight is to be
[14:42] lukewarm and everything around you tries
[14:45] to put that fire out and the challenge
[14:48] is to keep it going now how do you keep
[14:51] the fire going you got to keep putting
[14:53] wood on the fire you got to keep feeding
[14:56] the fire with something that's going to
[14:58] burn and that's the thing and and we get
[15:01] into it a lot with young people is you
[15:03] know well what's wrong with this what's
[15:05] wrong with that what's wrong and there's
[15:07] a lot there's a whole lot of things out
[15:09] there that aren't wrong we're not the
[15:10] fun police and we're not here to say
[15:12] don't have fun and don't do this and
[15:14] don't have entertainment but the
[15:16] question is is is what you're throwing
[15:18] on the fire making you burn bright is it
[15:21] keeping it alive there's only so much
[15:23] entertainment you can throw on the fire
[15:25] there's only so much decent movies you
[15:27] can throw on the Fire and the fire stay
[15:30] lit you got to keep the fire going and
[15:33] that's that's the challenge you know
[15:35] because and we'll get to it later I
[15:36] don't want to get too far ahead of
[15:38] myself but brother brandom said this
[15:39] bride will by no means be a lukewarm Leo
[15:43] to We Can't be lukewarm about this word
[15:46] we got to be a fire burning bright for
[15:48] the whole world to see amen amen let's
[15:51] go to him in prayer before we read the
[15:53] scripture tonight father Lord we thank
[15:56] you Lord for these young people and
[15:57] every adult Lord everyone that's come
[15:59] out and gathered with us on this Friday
[16:00] night to look into your word Lord as as
[16:03] our brother Michael said may it not just
[16:05] we look at as just the Bible study but
[16:07] Lord this is your word this is this is
[16:09] the message of the hour Lord may it
[16:11] light a fire lord may may we have a
[16:13] passion for it may you just reveal to us
[16:16] maybe something we haven't seen before
[16:18] bring to our remembrance Lord Lord just
[16:20] something that would ignite that fire
[16:22] within us and and Lord turn us away from
[16:25] from things that are putting out the
[16:26] fire in our life father Lord I just pray
[16:28] pray you'll reveal yourself to us that
[16:30] you'll speak through us tonight Lord
[16:32] help me step aside and and Lord just be
[16:35] used by you to to speak to the needs of
[16:37] your people and Lord may it not just be
[16:39] a time of learning but may Revelation
[16:41] strike our hearts tonight I pray father
[16:43] Lord we commit it to you now in Jesus
[16:45] name amen
[16:48] amen amen while you're still standing
[16:50] we're going to we're going to go ahead
[16:51] and read read our scripture it's so
[16:54] wonderful to have each and one of you
[16:55] here tonight I know there's many that
[16:57] are that are out and there's others are
[16:59] traveling and things but you you have
[17:00] all come and showed up and I appreciate
[17:02] that and your support and we just want
[17:04] to look into the good things of God
[17:06] tonight amen and we've been on this
[17:08] journey through the church ages I know
[17:10] it's been a minute since we've had one
[17:11] of these but we've made it to the leodan
[17:14] age that's your age that's where we're
[17:17] at so we're no longer looking back in
[17:20] history but we're looking to see if we
[17:22] can recognize our day and recognize our
[17:25] message amen so we're going to look here
[17:27] in Revelation 3
[17:29] and verse 14 we'll read down through the
[17:31] 22nd verse 314 down through the 22nd
[17:36] verse and it says and un the angel of
[17:38] the Church of the leans write these
[17:41] things saith the amen the faithful and
[17:45] true witness the beginning of the
[17:47] creation of God I Know Thy works that
[17:50] thou art neither cold nor hot I would
[17:53] thou were cold or hot so then because
[17:56] Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor
[17:58] hot not I will spew thee out of my mouth
[18:02] because thou sayest I am rich and
[18:03] increase with goods and have need of
[18:06] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[18:08] wretched and miserable and poor and
[18:10] blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of
[18:13] me gold tried in the fire that thou
[18:16] mayest me be rich and white rment that
[18:19] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[18:21] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[18:24] anoint thine eyes with isav that thou
[18:26] mayest see and as many as I love I
[18:30] rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore
[18:34] and repent behold I stand at the door
[18:36] and knock If any man hear my voice and
[18:39] open the door I will come into him and I
[18:42] will suck with him and he with me to him
[18:45] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[18:47] me in my throne even as I also overcame
[18:50] and am sat down with my father in his
[18:52] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[18:55] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[18:58] amen I pray that the Lord will add His
[19:00] blessings as you have your
[19:02] seats amen as we usually do just a a
[19:05] moment of review and and and hopefully I
[19:08] I understand the busyness of life but
[19:10] hopefully as we prepare for these uh
[19:13] services that you are reading through
[19:15] the church age book yourself because
[19:17] there's so much in there that we we
[19:19] can't necessarily cover we try to hit
[19:21] the highlights and break it down into
[19:23] portions that's easy to understand but
[19:25] hopefully you're reading this and
[19:26] feeding on this yourself and just want
[19:28] to start a little bit with a review of
[19:30] the ages things that we have covered and
[19:32] talked about as we've gone through this
[19:34] study and we started with the Ephesian
[19:36] age and we learned that that messenger
[19:38] was Paul and then we went to the sman
[19:40] age and it was irenius and the pergan
[19:43] age Martin the tyan age Columba the
[19:47] sardan age Luther Philadelphian age
[19:50] Wesley so these are the ages that we
[19:53] have covered and and The Messengers of
[19:55] each age that that we've looked into and
[19:58] and and and we learned that brother
[19:59] brandham told us there was a key that
[20:01] allowed him to know what each messenger
[20:04] was and he said it is the
[20:07] Revelation that God never changes and
[20:10] that his ways are as unchangeable as he
[20:13] is and I put this slide up every single
[20:16] time we have a study and I want you to
[20:18] get that down in your heart that Jesus
[20:20] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[20:23] forever and a lot of times you know we
[20:25] we apply that to the miraculous well God
[20:27] still heals and God still does this but
[20:30] we also have to apply to to things God
[20:33] likes and things God don't like and and
[20:35] as the times change around us and we
[20:37] live in an Ever Changing World God does
[20:41] not change he is exactly the same as he
[20:44] he has ever been and brother brandham
[20:46] says that this is the key to the whole
[20:48] thing he says it's the Keystone of the
[20:52] entire Bible so like I said it's so
[20:55] important to remember in a world that
[20:56] never stops changing you you know
[20:58] something's cool one day and then a week
[21:01] later it's not cool anymore you know I
[21:03] taught middle school for all those years
[21:05] and and you you know these sayings would
[21:07] come and y'all know y'all y'all pick up
[21:09] on some of the slang of the day and all
[21:11] of a sudden there's some new word that
[21:13] nobody knows what it means except the
[21:15] youth and they're using it continually
[21:17] and then like three weeks later somebody
[21:19] says it and they're a complete idiot cuz
[21:21] man that's so last month and that's how
[21:24] quickly things change around you and and
[21:26] you're some you know you're not cool
[21:28] anymore cuz you said something that was
[21:30] totally cool two weeks ago but that's
[21:33] not how God is if he said it he still
[21:35] means it he still stands by he does not
[21:39] change and you can rest on his word and
[21:41] you can rest on his promises I for one
[21:44] am extremely thankful that I don't have
[21:46] to figure out what God likes today and
[21:49] then next week figure out what he likes
[21:51] God what he likes and his program it
[21:53] never changes amen and we've learned
[21:57] that that brother Brown said that the
[21:59] characteristics of the ages he says
[22:01] these seven churches located in Asia
[22:04] Minor contain certain characteristics
[22:08] within them at that ancient date which
[22:11] becomes M mature fruit in later ages so
[22:17] in other words the characteristics of
[22:18] these cities matches the characteristics
[22:21] of the age that they were chosen to
[22:23] represent and I know we've gone over
[22:25] this every time but I just want you to
[22:27] have a firm grasp of what we're talking
[22:29] about so we come to Lea you see it in
[22:33] the bottom right hand of the of the map
[22:37] here it started around
[22:40] 1906 all the way till
[22:43] present and we know that a leoda means
[22:48] people's rights and brother Brandon
[22:50] would tell us that it was actually a
[22:51] very common name and its meaning is
[22:53] people's rights or Justice of the people
[22:58] and there I spend a little time here for
[22:59] a minute and I think of how fitting a
[23:02] characteristic that this is for for this
[23:04] church and for this city to represent
[23:07] this age because there has never been a
[23:09] time like this time when it comes to the
[23:12] demanding of Rights well I have a right
[23:15] and we have a right and constant cries
[23:18] for equality and constant cries about
[23:21] Justice and and the political move of
[23:24] the day and the social move of the day
[23:26] is to make everything equal
[23:29] no matter how Preposterous it
[23:32] is think about it's not that we don't
[23:35] believe in treating people right it's
[23:37] not that we don't believe in treating
[23:38] people Fair no matter their race their
[23:41] gender or their background that that's
[23:42] not the point that that's not what we're
[23:44] talking about the point is what is the
[23:47] truth behind the
[23:49] movement what is the truth behind the
[23:52] movement you know the movements many
[23:54] times for justice or equality or
[23:56] fairness are actually just a front
[23:59] the movements are they're just a front
[24:01] the movement is the sheep's clothing
[24:03] that's hiding the
[24:05] wolf the movement is an attack on
[24:08] biblical standards and social norms that
[24:11] were formed by those biblical standards
[24:14] but the attack comes in a veil that that
[24:17] says we just want to be treated the same
[24:19] we just want to be treated fairly we
[24:22] just want equality and and there's so
[24:24] many different ones that we could look
[24:25] at but just an obvious one that I can
[24:28] talk to you about tonight just so you
[24:30] kind of have understand what I'm talking
[24:31] about just look at the push for women's
[24:34] rights and women's suffrage suffrage for
[24:38] those of you who don't know means the
[24:39] right to vote so just look at that push
[24:42] and that push wound up with the 19th
[24:44] Amendment to the Constitution in 1920
[24:48] and it granted women the right to vote
[24:51] well what's wrong with that brother
[24:52] Aaron what's what's wrong with that see
[24:56] when you're judging something don't Jud
[24:58] just judge that
[25:00] something don't just look at it as
[25:02] simply well it was all about the right
[25:04] to vote look at what is behind the
[25:08] movement first of all let me say this
[25:10] women should be treated right sisters
[25:12] you should be treated right you
[25:14] shouldn't feel like a second class
[25:16] citizen you should have a vital role
[25:18] you're just as good and just as smart
[25:21] sometimes better and
[25:23] smarter none of that is the point even
[25:26] though that becomes the talking points
[25:29] of the
[25:30] movements that's not the point behind it
[25:32] but see the spirit behind it was never
[25:35] after the right to vote the spirit
[25:38] behind it was never about equal rights
[25:40] it was the elimination of distinction
[25:42] between the Sexes it was to weaken male
[25:46] leadership it was to the beginning of
[25:49] eroding of gender specific roles in
[25:53] society that is the beginning of it and
[25:55] and yes it is it is veiled in don't we
[25:58] deserve rights
[26:00] too and that's just the veil of it and
[26:03] and you know I look back and I was
[26:05] looking through all these pictures and
[26:07] I'm looking at what we would call in the
[26:10] day worldly
[26:15] women look at the way they're
[26:20] dressed I would say maybe more modest
[26:23] than a lot of Believers
[26:26] today these are the ones on the front
[26:29] lines of The Cutting Edge of women's
[26:32] rights why do you have to be careful
[26:35] what you're getting behind look at what
[26:36] it's led to
[26:38] today it was never about the right to
[26:40] vote look at the sign Mr President how
[26:42] long must women wait for Liberty and I
[26:46] ask you what has that Liberty led
[26:50] to what is behind the movement so so it
[26:53] goes from gaining equal rights to no
[26:56] longer being satisfied in the the role
[26:59] that God intended the the problem is and
[27:01] I will say this a lot of times movements
[27:03] come from the misapplication of Truth a
[27:07] lot of times women begin to want and I'm
[27:09] just using this as example there's lots
[27:11] of other examples but since we're here
[27:12] they want freedom and they want equal
[27:14] rights because men Miss Supply
[27:16] leadership and is holding them down
[27:18] under their thumb so so men it's very
[27:20] important that when we read scriptures
[27:22] about leadership and the role of a man
[27:24] that we understand how to properly apply
[27:26] that a woman is not a doormat for you to
[27:30] rule and Reign Over And if you do then
[27:32] it leads to a woman looking for equal
[27:35] freedoms and other ways of expression
[27:38] and things of that nature so a lot of
[27:40] times these movements are born from
[27:42] those situations I understand
[27:44] that but what it is it leads to no
[27:47] longer being satisfied in the role God
[27:50] gave you and now they want out of the
[27:53] home now we want the same jobs now we
[27:57] want to be in the military we want to be
[27:59] the police now we want to be
[28:01] Pilots you see how that's been working
[28:03] out
[28:04] lately and listen I'll say this I
[28:07] actually feel like women can fly just as
[28:10] good as men they just can't
[28:14] land now we want to be
[28:19] president until now we've reached the
[28:21] point that Mama isn't raising her
[28:24] children the daycare is or the
[28:26] babysitter is or the tele T ision is
[28:29] Mama's not there and you see the trick
[28:31] of the devil it never was that women
[28:33] weren't capable it never was that they
[28:36] weren't smart enough it was that God had
[28:38] set things up in a way for there to be a
[28:40] home and for there to be a Fifth Gospel
[28:42] and now it comes around and and they've
[28:44] achieved all this greatness and there's
[28:46] no Fifth Gospel and the children are
[28:47] being raised by anything but the
[28:52] gospel and the separation of uh has
[28:55] gotten to an now that the separation of
[28:57] indie any gender specific roles has led
[29:00] directly to the mess that we live with
[29:03] today the whole transgender nonsense the
[29:06] men can be women and women can be men
[29:08] and men in the bathroom with your little
[29:10] girls and men playing sports with the
[29:12] girls why why people's
[29:17] rights and you can't say anything about
[29:19] it because they have a right and they
[29:21] deserve a right and they have this right
[29:25] what a perfect name for the age we live
[29:27] in
[29:29] if you can't look at it today and and
[29:30] and realize that that this wasn't just
[29:32] brother Brown making something up that
[29:34] this Nails this age absolutely perfectly
[29:39] it's incredible to me so I want to tell
[29:42] you young people because many times if
[29:43] you look at just about any major
[29:46] movement pick one the hippie movement I
[29:49] I I I don't care any movement you will
[29:52] see talking points out there that make
[29:55] it seem
[29:57] reasonable you'll find Talking Points
[29:59] well don't you think that they deserve
[30:02] but that's really not the move that's
[30:04] the
[30:05] hook and understand that the target for
[30:08] these movements and you will see many
[30:09] more of them is you they're not trying
[30:13] to get the older people on board they're
[30:16] after the young
[30:17] people all right so when you see a
[30:19] movement and I just want to give you
[30:21] this word even if it seems worthy even
[30:25] if it in itself seems to be a Worthy
[30:28] calls make sure you look deeper into
[30:30] what is at its
[30:32] core what is it hitched
[30:35] to and I've heard it said like this
[30:37] don't just look at the horse but what
[30:40] wagon is that horse
[30:42] pulling what what's with it because many
[30:45] times things sound good but they cannot
[30:48] be achieved without the destruction of
[30:51] landmarks or Norms or standards and
[30:54] we're a people that we're supposed to
[30:56] have standards our standards should be
[30:58] different from the world standards our
[31:00] different it should be different than
[31:02] the Baptist standards our our standards
[31:04] should be different than the than the
[31:06] church standards of the world we're
[31:07] supposed to hold a different standard so
[31:10] don't hook yourself to a cause that
[31:12] makes you bring down your standards or
[31:15] identifies you with their
[31:18] standards for instance as time goes on
[31:21] you're going to see a push you will see
[31:24] a push and it's even going on now for
[31:26] for religions to come together so that
[31:30] we can all get along so that we can all
[31:32] be treated the same but I ask you how
[31:35] can a religion that seeks peace be one
[31:38] with a religion that seeks
[31:42] violence how can those two be equal or
[31:44] be one only by destroying what they
[31:48] stand for in the first place can they
[31:51] ever have
[31:52] Unity understand that about the unity
[31:55] that this world is going to offer you
[31:57] only by destroying what you stand for
[32:00] now can you ever have Unity with the
[32:03] world you can never have Unity with the
[32:06] world and keep the standards God has
[32:08] called you to and and and and and keep
[32:11] the word that God has called you to
[32:12] uphill the only way you can have Unity
[32:15] is for those standards to be torn down
[32:18] Le
[32:19] oia a destruction of everything so that
[32:24] value may be placed upon supposed unity
[32:27] and equ
[32:28] quality there's your a definition to
[32:30] hold on what is leosia it's the
[32:33] destruction of everything so that th you
[32:36] may be placed upon supposed unity and
[32:40] equality the city of
[32:44] leoda had a great medical school and and
[32:47] arts and science and they worshiped Zeus
[32:51] frequent earthquakes happened here f it
[32:53] finally caused the earthquakes finally
[32:56] caused its abandonment
[32:58] it was a city of great earthquakes once
[33:01] again how perfect for the age that we
[33:03] live in and the prophecy that this age
[33:05] is
[33:09] under and this age will end the age that
[33:12] we live in is going to end with with God
[33:15] shaking the whole world brother brandham
[33:17] says not only will World Systems crumble
[33:20] but the very Earth will be shaken and
[33:22] then renovated for the millennial reign
[33:25] of Christ this city was Rich it was it
[33:28] was full of culture science abounded but
[33:31] the earthquakes finally made it
[33:33] uninhabitable brother brandham says it
[33:35] in every attribute ancient leoda is
[33:39] found reborn in the 20th century in
[33:43] every
[33:43] attribute he says in the mercy of God
[33:47] May those who have an ear to hear come
[33:49] out of her that they be not partakers of
[33:51] her sins and the consequent
[33:55] judgment listen young people that you
[33:58] tonight by the mercies of God may you
[34:01] have an ear and and and realize you're
[34:03] being called not to be partakers of
[34:05] these things not to be partakers of the
[34:07] judgments that's coming and and we can't
[34:10] just sit in a place that it's same old
[34:11] same old same old to where you get you
[34:13] know you find yourself slowly getting
[34:15] led to sleep you have to recognize we're
[34:18] at the place where the earthquake is
[34:20] going to make this place uninhabitable
[34:22] where the wars is going to make this
[34:23] place uninhabitable where the nuclear
[34:25] bombs is going to make this place
[34:26] uninhabitable and you don't want to be
[34:29] one that's left
[34:32] behind moving on
[34:35] now you one of the things that critics
[34:37] will use and I just want to deal with
[34:39] this for a minute maybe you know maybe
[34:41] you don't know you know but one of the
[34:44] things that critics will use to try to
[34:45] discredit the ministry of William
[34:47] brandham is they will say that he
[34:49] prophesied that the world would end in
[34:53] 1977 and if you read this chapter and
[34:56] what we ask you to read you found out
[34:58] for yourself that that's not the
[35:00] truth this actually not true and in this
[35:03] next little bit we're going to show you
[35:04] the true quote and why the quote was
[35:07] made
[35:09] okay he says the layot ofan age began
[35:12] around the turn of the 20th century
[35:14] perhaps
[35:15] 1906 how long will it last as a servant
[35:18] of God who has had multitudes of visions
[35:21] of which none has ever failed let me
[35:25] predict now notice I did not say
[35:29] prophesy he makes it very clear I want
[35:31] you to
[35:32] know I don't want you to get this
[35:36] confused I'm just it's a prediction it's
[35:39] something I feel God didn't tell me
[35:44] this
[35:46] predict that this age will end
[35:49] around 19
[35:54] 77 now most of you are probably aware
[35:57] Ware of the seven continuous visions
[35:59] that brother Bram had in June of
[36:02] 1933 and if you're not we're going to go
[36:04] into that for a minute so you have an
[36:05] understanding and to me it helps bring
[36:08] about why the prediction was even
[36:10] made he told about these seven Visions
[36:13] throughout throughout his ministry and
[36:16] he based this prediction on these
[36:18] visions and the rate at which they were
[36:20] coming to pass they were happening very
[36:23] quickly they were happening right before
[36:25] his eyes and and he knew knew that they
[36:28] must all come to pass before the Lord
[36:30] returned and at the writing of this book
[36:33] The Church age book he States based on
[36:36] these seven Visions along with the rapid
[36:40] changes in other words these things are
[36:42] happening
[36:43] quick Vision One Vision Two Vision three
[36:46] vision four he's getting to the place
[36:47] where they've all been fulfilled and
[36:48] he's going it can't go much
[36:50] longer it's happening very quickly the
[36:53] these first Visions are are rapidly
[36:55] progressing I don't see how it can go
[36:59] 1977 he
[37:01] says the rapid changes which has swept
[37:04] the world these last 50 years I predict
[37:06] he says again and again he says I do not
[37:09] prophesy that these Visions will all
[37:12] have come to pass by
[37:15] 1977 now let me say this he says can
[37:20] anyone prove any of these Visions wrong
[37:23] were they not all fulfilled he says yes
[37:28] each one has been fulfilled or is in the
[37:32] process right
[37:35] now and so judging by that and and his
[37:38] own personal studies he says he he made
[37:41] a
[37:42] prediction and he made it very clear
[37:45] that it was a prediction he left no room
[37:48] for anybody to say he
[37:52] prophesied it's a prediction and and the
[37:55] Visions were being fulfilled so rapidly
[37:57] and it was all lining up and they were
[37:59] all coming to pass right before his eyes
[38:02] and he just couldn't see it going beyond
[38:04] that time but brother Aaron why
[38:08] 1977 well I like what brother Tim has
[38:10] said before he says it got so dark in
[38:12] the age that he just couldn't see beyond
[38:14] that year he couldn't see beyond that so
[38:17] he said that that's that's the end of it
[38:19] all because it was so dark now where
[38:21] does that tell you where we
[38:24] stand 50s something years into the
[38:26] darkness
[38:29] listen you better be a a fire burning
[38:31] bright cuz there is no other light in
[38:34] the world other than the light of this
[38:35] gospel other than the light of this
[38:37] message it it's the only light there is
[38:40] don't get distracted by the lights of
[38:42] leoa they'll lead you to destruction it
[38:44] is dark and the only light is keep your
[38:47] eyes on the word keep your eyes on the
[38:49] message keep your eyes on his coming
[38:52] because he may not have come in 1977 but
[38:55] you've heard it over and over he's come
[38:57] for for many and he is coming back when
[39:01] I don't know but I know I want to be
[39:04] ready when he comes back amen you know I
[39:09] just got to thinking about it for myself
[39:11] and I thought you know even prophets can
[39:14] Wonder and even prophets can
[39:17] ponder how will it be what what what's
[39:21] it going to be like when's this going to
[39:22] happen and and and and you they're not
[39:24] above that they're men like you and I
[39:27] and I got to thinking of Jesus's
[39:29] Forerunner and his first coming John the
[39:31] Baptist and you know and he declares
[39:33] Jesus is the Messiah and his whole
[39:35] Ministry leads up to his coming and then
[39:37] it culminates there in the River Jordan
[39:40] as he baptizes Jesus and now he expects
[39:43] things to begin to unfold and he has
[39:45] certain ways that he's expecting things
[39:47] to go and now surely the work's going to
[39:49] happen like this and and that and it's
[39:51] obvious that John had ponderings it's
[39:54] obvious that he had ways he thought it
[39:56] was going to go and how quickly it was
[39:58] going to go and it's all going to wrap
[40:00] up by this moment and then obviously it
[40:03] doesn't go exactly how the Forerunner
[40:06] anticipated and maybe even predicted to
[40:09] the point that he sends disciples to ask
[40:12] Jesus are you even the
[40:15] one he begins to doubt his own Ministry
[40:20] he begins to doubt everything because
[40:23] the way he thought it would go it didn't
[40:26] go prophets are are not Beyond or above
[40:29] ponderings and wonderings
[40:32] amen it's just a personal
[40:34] note brother brand I'm saying it's just
[40:37] a personal prediction I I have my
[40:39] reasons but this isn't a prophecy but I
[40:43] want to look at these visions that the
[40:44] lord gave him here in
[40:48] 1933 the seven
[40:50] Visions the first one was that mus and I
[40:53] condensed these so I didn't go into all
[40:55] the details of them museline would
[40:57] invade Ethiopia and that Nation would
[40:59] fall at his
[41:01] steps an Austrian named Adolf Hitler
[41:03] would rise up as dictator over Germany
[41:05] and draw the world into war now realize
[41:07] this is this is six years before any of
[41:09] this
[41:11] happens there would be three great isms
[41:14] fascism naism Nazism and communism but
[41:17] the first two would be swallowed up into
[41:20] the third communism The Voice warned
[41:24] watch Russia now I know you don't
[41:28] follow politics maybe that much or the
[41:30] the rise and fall of world governments
[41:32] but I've always noted as many others
[41:34] have as
[41:37] well that for many many many
[41:41] years the watch Russia part wasn't even
[41:44] in its proper place so to speak to where
[41:46] it could be fulfilled because and I
[41:48] don't have the exact dates in in my head
[41:50] but back in the early um part of the
[41:53] century Russia
[41:54] fell and became the Soviet Union
[41:58] and stayed the Soviet Union there was no
[42:02] Russia I mean Old-Timers called them
[42:05] Russia because that's what they knew him
[42:06] as but it was the Soviet Union all the
[42:09] way up to the early 90s it was in my
[42:12] childhood in my early teenage years when
[42:15] the Soviet Union fell and once again we
[42:18] have Russia we're standing in a place
[42:22] where that warning is very pertinent
[42:26] watch Russia keep your eye on Russia the
[42:29] fourth Vision showed the great advances
[42:31] in science that would come after the
[42:34] second world
[42:35] war fifth Vision showed the moral
[42:38] decline of the age centered around women
[42:41] she went into a state of undress and the
[42:43] vision showed the perversion of the
[42:45] whole
[42:46] world the sixth Vision there arose up in
[42:49] America a most beautiful woman I just
[42:51] copy and pasted this one straight out of
[42:53] the church age book but cruel woman she
[42:55] held the people in her complete power I
[42:58] believe that this was the rise of the
[43:00] Roman Catholic Church though I knew it
[43:02] could possibly be a vision of some woman
[43:05] rising in great power in America due to
[43:07] a popular vote by women and the last
[43:10] Vision the last and seventh Vision was
[43:13] wherein I heard a most terrible
[43:15] explosion as I turned to look I saw
[43:18] nothing but debris craters and smoke all
[43:22] over the land of America you know we sit
[43:26] here and you know and you look at some
[43:28] of these Visions like
[43:30] even uh the fourth Vision showed the
[43:33] great advances in science that would
[43:35] come after the second you know if
[43:37] somebody would have prophesied this in
[43:39] 1985 you might be like well well yeah
[43:41] you kind of saw it coming you know I
[43:43] mean computers were starting to come
[43:44] around and go back and look at what the
[43:47] world looked like in
[43:51] 1933 and then look at the things he he's
[43:53] prophesying about cars driving on roads
[43:56] automatically
[43:59] nonsense science
[44:02] fiction
[44:05] impossibilities the moral decline of the
[44:08] age centered around women look just bear
[44:11] with me for a minute let me go back and
[44:13] show you the
[44:17] women and he starts saying the women are
[44:19] going to be in a state of
[44:21] undress to where they're walking around
[44:23] wearing
[44:24] nothing and the whole world is going to
[44:26] go into
[44:28] perversion these were the bad
[44:33] women once again if this prophecy comes
[44:35] out in the 1960s even maybe during the
[44:38] the hippie movement you're like yeah
[44:40] definitely I mean anybody could probably
[44:41] see that come but to see it from
[44:47] here think about the some of the things
[44:49] that that he was saying here at this
[44:52] point in
[44:54] 1933 to the people of the time it would
[44:56] have been very
[44:59] strange it would have seemed
[45:02] outlandish but I'd like to tell you that
[45:05] it has come to pass they have all come
[45:08] to pass
[45:09] exactly and they have come to pass and
[45:12] they are coming to pass right now young
[45:15] people I want to tell you you can't be
[45:16] whistling past the graveyard tonight
[45:18] acting like there's nothing happening
[45:20] Visions are coming to pass the word is
[45:23] coming to pass the word is being
[45:25] fulfilled Sodom is all around us just as
[45:29] the vision said it was and I want to
[45:31] tell you the last Vision will also be
[45:35] fulfilled just today just today in the
[45:38] White House president Trump kicked out
[45:42] the president of the Ukraine after they
[45:44] had a big dust up back and forth over
[45:47] everything over there and he told him
[45:49] you're gambling with World War
[45:52] I and he had him removed from the White
[45:55] House that's today that's right now
[45:58] that's the time that we're living in on
[46:00] the edge of the final
[46:02] Vision you can't pretend it's not
[46:04] happening you can't stick your head in
[46:06] the ground and act like it's not
[46:08] happening we have arrived at the end
[46:11] time that's where we're standing in 1964
[46:15] a great earthquake shook Alaska and
[46:16] brother Bram said that Good Friday
[46:19] earthquake of Alaska shook the whole
[46:21] world though it did not unbalance it but
[46:24] God was warning by a world trimmer what
[46:26] he will soon do on a greater scale he's
[46:29] going to blast and rock this sin cursed
[46:32] world my brother my sister and there is
[46:34] only one place that can stand that shock
[46:36] and that is in the fold of the Lord
[46:38] Jesus and I would beseech you while
[46:41] God's Mercy is still available to you
[46:43] that you give your whole life
[46:45] unreservedly to Jesus Christ young
[46:49] people the shaking is coming and the
[46:51] shaking is now and all that can be
[46:54] shaken will be shaken brother Aaron
[46:56] you're trying to scare me no I'm not I'm
[46:58] offering you grace and mercy tonight and
[46:59] telling you get into Jesus Christ the
[47:02] door is open tonight is an opportunity
[47:04] don't wait don't play don't pretend it's
[47:07] not happening it is happening and will
[47:09] happen in your day get in surrender
[47:12] everything because the Visions is coming
[47:15] to pass
[47:16] amen amen hey you can be scared or you
[47:21] can Rejoice it's up to
[47:24] you but that depends on where you're at
[47:27] if I was outside the Sheepfold tonight
[47:29] I'd be scared by
[47:31] it but once you're inside the ark
[47:33] brother Brown says let the storms come
[47:35] then let the waves come then we'll Crest
[47:37] every wave listen you don't got to fear
[47:39] it you don't got to worry about it just
[47:40] get in the ark and know I'm safe I'm
[47:43] secure I'm going over this before the
[47:45] bombs fall I'm going to be out of here
[47:48] get in there tonight and experience that
[47:52] peace the
[47:54] messenger brother brandham says I doubt
[47:57] very
[47:58] much if any age truly knew the messenger
[48:01] that God had sent unto it except in the
[48:04] first age where Paul was the messenger
[48:07] and even in that age many did not
[48:09] recognize him for what he
[48:13] was now as you read the church age book
[48:15] brother Bram does not declare himself
[48:17] the messenger in so many words but he
[48:20] does lay out exactly what the messenger
[48:22] is going to look like what the messenger
[48:24] is going to do and I'm going to say if
[48:25] you can read and have reading
[48:26] comprehension you can come to the proper
[48:29] conclusion the messenger of our day of
[48:31] the leoan age is William brandham born
[48:35] 1909 no matter what the trivia game
[48:40] said
[48:42] 1909 lived in
[48:45] 1965 I want to tell you tonight he's a
[48:47] Vindicated Prophet Vindicated by the
[48:50] pillar of fire it came down night after
[48:53] night and it said amen to what was
[48:56] preached
[48:57] the messenger to the age is William Bram
[49:02] but just so we can look through things
[49:04] and see what brother brandham says about
[49:06] the messenger we're going to go through
[49:07] some of it just briefly not not in the
[49:10] detail that could be he says the
[49:13] messenger is going to be a prophet he
[49:16] will have the office and the ministry of
[49:18] a prophet Vindicated because of its
[49:21] accuracy we can say Amen it'll be a
[49:24] word-based Ministry it will reveal what
[49:26] was was in the Thunders that was sealed
[49:28] up until the last day the fact that the
[49:32] Thunder that the seals have been opened
[49:34] tells you where we're at because it
[49:36] couldn't be revealed until the last day
[49:38] and it's revealed you're living in The
[49:41] Last Day scripture says Revelation 10:7
[49:45] this is you know showing us this last
[49:47] day messenger says in the days of the
[49:49] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[49:51] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[49:53] be finished as he had declared to his
[49:56] servant the prophets brother Bram says
[49:58] this one here in Revelation 10:7 what we
[50:01] just read is the seventh age messenger
[50:05] and it is a man and he is to bring a
[50:07] message from God and his message in
[50:09] Ministry is going to finish the mystery
[50:11] of God as declared to his servants the
[50:14] prophets God is going to treat this last
[50:16] Messenger as a prophet because he is a
[50:19] prophet that is what Paul was in the
[50:21] first age and the last age has one too I
[50:24] say thank you Lord Jesus for a prophet
[50:27] Amos 36 and 7 shall a trumpet be blown
[50:30] in the city and the people not be afraid
[50:32] shall there be evil in a city and the
[50:34] Lord hath not done it surely the Lord
[50:37] God will do
[50:38] nothing but he revealeth his secret unto
[50:41] his servants the prophets so not only do
[50:45] we see the last day messenger here in
[50:47] Revelation 10:7 but we also see that the
[50:50] word speaks of Elijah coming before
[50:53] Jesus returns and I want to look at this
[50:55] in two places
[50:57] Matthew 17
[50:59] and10 and and and young people hopefully
[51:01] what we can establish with you in in all
[51:04] of this is we haven't believed cunningly
[51:07] devised
[51:08] fables this isn't just brother brandham
[51:11] said or brother Tim said or brother
[51:13] these things are scripture-based these
[51:15] things are in the word Matthew 17:10 and
[51:19] his disciples asked him saying why then
[51:21] say the scribes that Elias must first
[51:23] come and Jesus answered and said un them
[51:26] Elias truly shall first come and restore
[51:31] all things what do we preach a message
[51:33] of restoration a restoration of the word
[51:37] Malachi 4 behold I will send you Elijah
[51:40] the prophet before the coming of the
[51:41] great and Dreadful day of the Lord and
[51:43] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[51:45] to the children and the Heart of the
[51:47] children to their fathers lest I come
[51:49] and smite the Earth with a curse so it's
[51:53] obvious in the scripture that Elijah
[51:56] must
[51:57] first come people say you know William
[52:00] Brown on wasn't a prophet William Brown
[52:02] on William and I say then where's
[52:04] Elijah because Elijah must first come
[52:07] it's in the Bible you don't want to
[52:09] accept it as William brownon where's
[52:11] your candidate where's yours that was
[52:13] Vindicated by the pillar of
[52:16] fire Elijah must first come and he has a
[52:20] very specific work to do and that work
[52:22] is to turn the hearts of the children to
[52:26] their father father s now notice up here
[52:29] it says turn the hearts of the fathers
[52:31] to the children and the Heart of the
[52:32] children to their fathers brother Bram
[52:35] comes and he separates it he has a very
[52:38] specific work to do and is to turn the
[52:40] hearts of the children to the
[52:43] fathers because he already came first
[52:46] before the first coming of Jesus in the
[52:49] ministry of John the Baptist and turn
[52:52] the father's Hearts to the children so
[52:54] that part right there he shall turn the
[52:55] hearts of the fathers to the children
[52:58] that part was fulfilled in the ministry
[53:00] of Elijah in John the
[53:03] Baptist he turned the hearts of the
[53:06] fathers to the children now according to
[53:08] scripture before the great and Dreadful
[53:11] day of the Lord just before the world
[53:13] Burns Elijah must come again he says the
[53:19] reason that we know this is his specific
[53:21] work now pay attention this is Brother
[53:23] Bram to do at that time is because he
[53:25] has already accomplished the part that
[53:28] says he shall turn the hearts of the
[53:29] fathers to the
[53:31] children when the Elijah Ministry was
[53:33] here in John the Baptist Luke 1:17 and
[53:37] he shall go before him in the spirit in
[53:39] the power of Elijah to turn the hearts
[53:41] of the fathers to the children and the
[53:43] disobedient to the wisdom of the just
[53:45] just uh to make ready a people prepared
[53:48] for the Lord that was John the
[53:50] Baptist in the ministry of John the
[53:53] hearts of the fathers were turned to the
[53:56] children brother Bram says this we we we
[53:58] know that because Jesus said so but it
[54:01] does not say that the hearts of the
[54:03] children were turned to the fathers that
[54:06] is yet to take place the hearts of the
[54:09] last day children that's
[54:12] you will be turned back to the
[54:14] Pentecostal fathers John got the fathers
[54:17] ready for Jesus to welcome the children
[54:20] into the fold now this Prophet upon whom
[54:23] the spirit of Elijah Falls will prepare
[54:25] the children to welcome back Jesus so
[54:30] when we talk of the Turning there
[54:31] there's two turnings there's fathers to
[54:33] the children and there's children to the
[54:36] fathers so the first part fathers to the
[54:39] children these are the fathers that were
[54:41] schooled in the law of
[54:43] Moses these were those under that
[54:46] Covenant that lived under the law they
[54:48] they were the fathers they were schooled
[54:50] in the law of Moses and John got the
[54:52] fathers ready for Jesus to welcome the
[54:55] children into the fold some of these
[54:58] accepted his message they saw the
[55:00] message for their day and they accepted
[55:02] the Messiah and he gave them the Holy
[55:04] Ghost on the day of
[55:06] Pentecost and they were born again you
[55:09] could even say they became
[55:11] children they were birthed this is the
[55:14] first turning but the second part is the
[55:17] children to the fathers because now we
[55:20] look back on those all those many years
[55:23] ago as the Pentecostal fathers and now a
[55:26] message has come to turn us back to that
[55:30] brother Brown says in the hearts of the
[55:31] children to the fathers now when this
[55:33] great Elijah comes in the end of the age
[55:36] he'll be taken the message of Pentecost
[55:38] I love that to turn the children to the
[55:42] faith of the fathers because he'll be
[55:44] rebuking them because they didn't keep
[55:47] this same faith that was back there at
[55:49] the beginning amen so what message turns
[55:53] you back to the faith the message he say
[55:54] is going to come and rebuke the for not
[55:57] keeping that Faith he says now I believe
[56:00] we pretty well realize it's going to be
[56:02] Elijah don't we now we know it brother
[56:07] brandham says since this Prophet
[56:09] messenger of revelation 10:7 will be the
[56:11] same as Malachi 4 he will be naturally
[56:15] like Elijah and John both were Men set
[56:18] apart from the accepted religious
[56:20] schools of their day both were men of
[56:22] the Wilderness both acted only when they
[56:24] had thus sayeth the Lord straight from
[56:26] God by Revelation both lashed out
[56:29] against the religious orders and leaders
[56:31] of their day though he will not be
[56:33] popular I can say that that's been
[56:36] fulfilled but listen he will be
[56:38] Vindicated by God as Jesus authenticated
[56:41] John and the Holy Ghost authenticated
[56:44] Jesus we can well expect this man will
[56:46] be first of all authenticated by the
[56:49] spirit working in his life in Acts of
[56:51] power that are indisputable and found
[56:54] nowhere else and Jesus himself in
[56:58] returning will authenticate him even as
[57:01] he authenticated
[57:04] John he says now this messenger of
[57:06] Malachi 4 in Revelation 10:7 is going to
[57:08] do two things one according to Malachi 4
[57:12] he will turn the hearts of the children
[57:13] to the fathers two he will reveal the
[57:16] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[57:17] Revelation 10 which are the revelations
[57:20] contained in the Seven Seals it will be
[57:22] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[57:25] that literally turn the hearts of the
[57:27] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[57:30] exactly so what' you say all that for
[57:33] brother and to show you the messenger to
[57:36] our age is William brownon he is the
[57:39] Fulfillment of Malachi 4 and without his
[57:42] ministry we wouldn't even know
[57:44] definitively that there are seven Church
[57:46] ages think about it all the stuff we've
[57:49] studied how do we know that because
[57:50] we've recognized our day and we've
[57:52] recognized our
[57:54] message others probe at it and some have
[57:57] even come close but none of them had the
[57:59] ministry of Revelation 10:7 none of them
[58:02] had the ministry of Malachi 4 Luke 17
[58:05] none of them had the pillar of fire none
[58:07] of them discerned the hearts of the
[58:08] people this ministry of William brandham
[58:11] was Vindicated and proved and therefore
[58:14] had the authority to proclaim the
[58:16] correct
[58:18] interpretation had the authority to
[58:19] proclaim the revelation of the seals and
[58:22] the revelation of the ages I say this
[58:24] message has turned our hearts back to
[58:27] the faith of the fathers and it has
[58:29] prepared us for the coming of the Lord
[58:32] Jesus Christ this is the message to the
[58:35] Church of leoda and our messenger was
[58:38] William Mariam
[58:41] Bram the
[58:43] salutation to the
[58:46] age Revelation
[58:48] 3:14 and we're going to spend some time
[58:51] breaking this
[58:53] down it says and unto the angel the the
[58:56] Church of the leod Deans right these
[58:58] things saith the
[59:00] amen these these things sayith the amen
[59:03] the faithful and the true witness the
[59:06] beginning of the creation of God brother
[59:10] Bram looks at this and he says Jesus is
[59:12] giving us this description of himself in
[59:15] relation to the last age the days of
[59:19] grace are winding up young people hear
[59:21] that the days of grace are winding up
[59:23] they're not over but they are winding
[59:26] winding up don't play around with it
[59:29] says he has looked from the first
[59:30] century right through to the 20th and
[59:32] told us all things concerning these ages
[59:35] before he reveals the characteristics of
[59:38] the last age to us he gives us one final
[59:41] look at his own gracious and supreme
[59:44] deity this is the Capstone revelation of
[59:49] him s he tells us thus saith the amen
[59:53] that's what he says at the beginning
[59:54] there these things sayith the amen thus
[59:57] sayith the amen Jesus is the amen of God
[1:00:00] Jesus is the so let it be of God Amen
[1:00:03] stands for finality it stands for
[1:00:05] approval it stands for prevailing
[1:00:07] promise it stands for unchanging promise
[1:00:11] it stands for the Seal of God I'm so
[1:00:15] thankful that what he says stands today
[1:00:19] you can Bank your very soul on it
[1:00:21] tonight amen and as as we read some of
[1:00:24] these things it may strike you that
[1:00:26] there's quite a bit of repetition in
[1:00:28] each age and the things that God says to
[1:00:31] the ages and it's because of the
[1:00:33] importance of certain things for
[1:00:36] instance in every age you've heard us
[1:00:38] say I Know Thy Works he says that in
[1:00:41] every age in each age there's a promise
[1:00:44] to the Overcomer in each age God says he
[1:00:47] that hath an ear and in each age God
[1:00:50] shows us his deity and I'm going to look
[1:00:53] at that for a minute and every age God
[1:00:56] shows us his deity First Age these
[1:01:00] things saith he that holdeth the Seven
[1:01:03] Stars and his right hand who walketh in
[1:01:05] the midst of the seven golden
[1:01:07] candlesticks second age these things
[1:01:10] saith the first and the last which was
[1:01:12] dead and is and is alive how could this
[1:01:15] be anything but deity how can this be
[1:01:17] anything but God third age these things
[1:01:20] saith he which hath the sharp sword with
[1:01:23] two edges fourth age these things sayith
[1:01:26] the Son of God who hath eye his eyes
[1:01:28] like unto a flame of fire and his feet
[1:01:30] are like fine brass fifth age these
[1:01:33] things saith he that hath the seven
[1:01:35] spirits of God and the Seven Stars sixth
[1:01:38] age these things saith he that is Holy
[1:01:41] he that is true he that hath the keys of
[1:01:43] David he that openeth and no man
[1:01:45] shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth
[1:01:47] and in the seventh age these things
[1:01:50] saith the amen the faithful and true
[1:01:52] witness the beginning of the creation of
[1:01:56] God now I want to say this and this
[1:01:59] thought was just really struck me today
[1:02:01] is we've covered a lot of material
[1:02:03] through these
[1:02:04] ages and there's probably a lot of
[1:02:06] material you don't
[1:02:08] remember there's probably things you
[1:02:10] walk out of here and forget within five
[1:02:12] minutes if you retained it at all while
[1:02:14] you were here I get
[1:02:17] that but if you don't get anything out
[1:02:20] of this study and out of this book I I I
[1:02:23] want you to know beyond any shadow of a
[1:02:25] doubt out that there is one God there is
[1:02:29] one God and his name is Jesus Jesus is
[1:02:32] fully God and we should understand that
[1:02:35] the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the
[1:02:37] Jesus of the New Testament that's why he
[1:02:40] can show his deity as Jesus in every
[1:02:43] single age brother Brown says here oh
[1:02:46] Israel the Lord thy God is one God the
[1:02:48] New Testament does not reveal another
[1:02:50] God it is a further revelation of the
[1:02:52] one and same God Christ did not come
[1:02:55] down to make himself known he did not
[1:02:58] come down to reveal the son he came to
[1:03:00] reveal and make known the father he
[1:03:02] never talked about two Gods he talked
[1:03:04] about one God and now in this last age
[1:03:07] we have come back to the Capstone
[1:03:09] Revelation the most important revelation
[1:03:12] of godhead in the whole Bible that is
[1:03:14] Jesus Is God and he and the father are
[1:03:18] one there is one God and his name is the
[1:03:22] Lord Jesus Christ he is the god of the
[1:03:26] amen he never changes he says it and it
[1:03:29] stands fast listen he is the Rock of
[1:03:32] Ages because he's not blowed this way
[1:03:34] and blowed that way what he said about
[1:03:36] you he still says it tonight he says
[1:03:39] you're going to make it you're still
[1:03:40] going to make it he said I forgiven you
[1:03:42] you're still forgiven you don't have to
[1:03:44] be wishy-washy with this God he is the
[1:03:47] god of finality he is the god of amen he
[1:03:51] is the Rock of
[1:03:52] Ages brother Bram talks about this in
[1:03:55] this sermon if you want to go listen to
[1:03:56] it in the sermon uh message of Grace
[1:04:01] 1961 and he was in the woods hunting and
[1:04:03] he had an experience and I'm I'm
[1:04:05] summarizing this and where he sees three
[1:04:07] rainbows and and he tries to get close
[1:04:10] to it and he feels to stop and he takes
[1:04:12] off his hat and he's standing a few
[1:04:14] yards from it and he he's discussing how
[1:04:16] these three Rainbows are coming up out
[1:04:17] of this hill
[1:04:19] and as he gets close he begins to
[1:04:22] realize he says I realized it was
[1:04:24] alive and realizing he's in the presence
[1:04:27] of God he says what would you have me to
[1:04:30] know he says just then the spirit of the
[1:04:33] Lord came and said Jesus of the New
[1:04:35] Testament is Jehovah of the old he only
[1:04:39] changed his mask from Spirit to
[1:04:44] man you know some people may read these
[1:04:46] things and that may sound odd to them
[1:04:48] that may sound Mystic that may sound
[1:04:51] superstitious they're almost magical or
[1:04:53] far-fetched as they would say and but
[1:04:56] but to me I read it and it lines up
[1:04:58] perfectly with the
[1:04:59] Bible because the first age messenger
[1:05:02] Paul had that same type of experience
[1:05:05] why wouldn't the last age
[1:05:07] messenger Paul is struck down by the
[1:05:09] pillar of fire and he identifies it
[1:05:12] because he knows the Old Testament and
[1:05:14] he says who art thou Lord and he says I
[1:05:17] am Jesus and Paul gets the Revelation
[1:05:20] right there Jehovah is Jesus and Jesus
[1:05:24] is God amen that's what brother brand s
[1:05:27] he says what would you have me to know
[1:05:29] and he tells him Jehovah of the old is
[1:05:32] Jesus of the new these things sayith the
[1:05:37] amen I like that it means that whatever
[1:05:40] he said is final it means that whatever
[1:05:42] he said to the first age and to the
[1:05:44] second age and to all ages about his own
[1:05:46] true church and about the false Vine is
[1:05:48] exactly right and it won't change it
[1:05:50] means that what he started out with in
[1:05:52] Genesis he will finish with in re
[1:05:55] Revelation he says now we can see again
[1:05:58] why the devil hates the Book of Genesis
[1:06:00] and Revelation he hates truth he knows
[1:06:03] the truth will prevail he knows what his
[1:06:05] end will be how he fights that but we
[1:06:08] are on the winning side can you let that
[1:06:12] sink in a little bit to you tonight you
[1:06:15] are on the winning side I mean come on
[1:06:18] somebody no matter what you're going
[1:06:21] through you're on The Winning Side
[1:06:22] tonight doesn't matter how you feel
[1:06:24] tonight doesn't matter what the devil's
[1:06:26] telling you tonight you are on The
[1:06:29] Winning Side amen so yes I'd like to
[1:06:33] tell you tonight you're going to make it
[1:06:35] you're going to do more than make it
[1:06:36] you're an overcomer you're on The
[1:06:38] Winning Side the devil says you can't
[1:06:40] the devil says you ain't you got this
[1:06:42] failure this mess up the prophet of God
[1:06:44] says you are on The Winning Side amen
[1:06:49] and for those of you in the valley
[1:06:50] tonight I'd like to remind you he hasn't
[1:06:53] forgotten you he hasn't forgotten you I
[1:06:57] love how brother Nathan dealt with those
[1:06:58] things on Sunday maybe you're in the
[1:07:00] valley tonight he has not forgotten you
[1:07:02] he cares about you tonight he's there
[1:07:05] for you tonight he he's not some
[1:07:07] impersonal God that he made you and then
[1:07:09] he died for you and then he stepped back
[1:07:11] and crossed his arms and said well let's
[1:07:13] just see how this works out let's just
[1:07:15] see how this turns out brother brother
[1:07:17] Bram deals with this and he says now I
[1:07:20] say that is how too many people are apt
[1:07:23] to think but that is wrong thinking for
[1:07:26] God is governing in the Affairs of men
[1:07:28] right now he is both Creator and
[1:07:31] sustainer what do you mean by that
[1:07:33] brother Aaron he's working on your
[1:07:35] situation right now he's dealing in your
[1:07:38] situation right now that mountain that
[1:07:41] you can't see around that Valley that
[1:07:42] you're in God is working in that
[1:07:45] situation right now he hasn't forgot
[1:07:48] about you he hasn't left you but he's
[1:07:51] working in your moment in your time the
[1:07:54] the very reason God exists why does he
[1:07:56] exist brother Brown says he exists for
[1:07:59] his own he exists for you how can he
[1:08:03] forget you you're why you're his being
[1:08:06] you're his everything you're why he's
[1:08:07] doing what he's doing he says he exists
[1:08:10] for his own and he's a faithful and true
[1:08:13] witness and you can rest in that
[1:08:16] faithfulness now that being said I'd
[1:08:18] like to add add this to
[1:08:21] that that you got to surrender your will
[1:08:24] to his will
[1:08:26] he says he's working all things at this
[1:08:28] moment according to the purpose of his
[1:08:30] own will you you have to trust that his
[1:08:33] will is what's best for you and yield to
[1:08:36] it when I say he's working on your
[1:08:37] behalf and he's moving on your situation
[1:08:40] and he's taking care of the situation
[1:08:42] that doesn't mean he's doing it exactly
[1:08:44] the way you want it to be worked out
[1:08:47] that doesn't mean it's all going to go
[1:08:48] perfect to how you figured it out in
[1:08:49] your head and and this is going to
[1:08:51] happen and that's going to happen but
[1:08:53] what you can do is you can trust
[1:08:55] that the way he works it out is going to
[1:08:58] work together for your good amen says he
[1:09:03] is a true
[1:09:04] witness now we talked about this last
[1:09:07] Age and and I want to bring it up again
[1:09:09] the word true here does not mean true as
[1:09:12] in contrast with
[1:09:15] false it expresses true means perfect
[1:09:19] realization in contrast to
[1:09:23] partial 1 Peter 1:8 says says whom
[1:09:25] having not seen you love you know words
[1:09:28] you had even seen Jesus but you love him
[1:09:32] and whom though now you see him not yet
[1:09:34] believe you rejoice with joy unspeakable
[1:09:37] and full of glory and brother Bram comes
[1:09:39] in referencing this scripture it says
[1:09:41] with them we Rejoice also we haven't
[1:09:44] seen him but we have felt him we know
[1:09:46] him now as much as our limited senses
[1:09:49] can let us but one day it'll be face to
[1:09:52] face church I'm ready for that day he
[1:09:54] says that is for this age he is coming
[1:09:57] at the end of this age partial
[1:10:00] realization will be made perfect
[1:10:02] realization completed realization look
[1:10:06] we've progressed from glory to glory and
[1:10:08] we've learned and we've had Revelations
[1:10:10] and and we see him clearer than ever
[1:10:12] before but we're not talking about that
[1:10:14] we're talking about soon in this age
[1:10:16] it's going to be face to face we're
[1:10:19] going to see him face to face brother
[1:10:21] Bram says one day we will be changed in
[1:10:23] the atoms we will put on immortality we
[1:10:26] will be all swallowed up in life then we
[1:10:29] will realize realization I love the way
[1:10:32] he puts that these atoms are going to
[1:10:34] change you're going to step into
[1:10:36] eternity and you're going to see him
[1:10:37] face to face it won't be through a glass
[1:10:40] Darkly it won't just be a revelation
[1:10:41] although we thank God for it it will be
[1:10:44] a reality and you will realize
[1:10:48] realization when brother Aaron this age
[1:10:51] you're living in it it's for you not
[1:10:55] another age you're going to experience
[1:10:57] this let me challenge you tonight and
[1:10:59] tell you your struggles aren't worth
[1:11:01] missing it your sins that so easily
[1:11:04] beset you aren't worth missing it your
[1:11:06] grudges and your bitterness aren't worth
[1:11:08] missing it the the the family cycles and
[1:11:11] Daddy's problems and Grandmama's
[1:11:13] problems those things ain't worth
[1:11:15] missing it this is the time this is the
[1:11:18] time to lay those things down and run
[1:11:21] this is the time to to lay those things
[1:11:23] aside the sin that would beset you and
[1:11:24] run with all your might forget your
[1:11:27] ideas and forget your thoughts and run
[1:11:29] tonight because when are we going to see
[1:11:31] him face to face that is for this age he
[1:11:36] says he's faithful and true he says he's
[1:11:40] faithful and true witness Creator and
[1:11:42] sustainer perfect realization the
[1:11:45] amen of
[1:11:47] God it goes on to say that he is the
[1:11:50] beginning of the creation of God
[1:11:55] brother Brown says that is who the Lord
[1:11:57] Jesus says he is we're going to begin to
[1:12:00] wind this down he says' but those words
[1:12:03] don't mean exactly as they sound to us
[1:12:06] he says just taking them the way they
[1:12:08] sound has made some people in fact
[1:12:10] multitudes of people get the idea that
[1:12:13] Jesus was the first creation of God
[1:12:16] making him lower than godhead then this
[1:12:20] first creation Jesus created all the
[1:12:23] rest of the universe and whatsoever it
[1:12:25] contains but that is not right because
[1:12:30] that doesn't line up with the rest of
[1:12:32] the Bible you can't make that line up
[1:12:35] and it all has to line up brother Brown
[1:12:37] says now we know for assurity that Jesus
[1:12:39] is God very God he is the creator John 1
[1:12:43] and3 says all things were made by him
[1:12:45] Jesus and without him was not anything
[1:12:48] made that was made so what does it mean
[1:12:51] when it says that he's the beginning of
[1:12:53] the creation of God
[1:12:55] brother brand tells us the words are
[1:12:58] that he is the beginner or the
[1:13:02] author of the creation of God I want to
[1:13:05] show us what he's talking about here so
[1:13:07] so we see him standing there in the
[1:13:08] midst of his church revealing who he is
[1:13:11] in the last age and he says I'm the
[1:13:15] author of the creation of God now
[1:13:18] brother Brandon makes it very clear in
[1:13:20] this moment in this last age when he's
[1:13:23] speaking he's not talking about the
[1:13:26] creation at the beginning listen he says
[1:13:31] this is another
[1:13:34] creation this has to do with the
[1:13:39] church this is a special designation of
[1:13:43] himself he is the creator of the church
[1:13:48] the Heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:13:53] bride so what what are we talking about
[1:13:55] here the be the beginning of the
[1:13:56] creation of God the the author of the
[1:13:58] creation of God remember Jesus was
[1:14:00] virgin born he was a God man man and God
[1:14:04] met and joined and so he was the first
[1:14:07] one of a new race that's what I talking
[1:14:10] about here he was the very first one of
[1:14:12] a new race brother Bram says 2
[1:14:14] Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be
[1:14:17] in Christ he is a new creation old
[1:14:22] things have passed away behold all
[1:14:24] things are become new there you can see
[1:14:26] that though man was of the old
[1:14:29] creation Now in Union with Christ he has
[1:14:32] become the new creation of God Ephesians
[1:14:36] 2:10 for we are his workmanship created
[1:14:39] in Union with Christ Jesus unto good
[1:14:42] works Ephesians 4:24 and that ye put on
[1:14:45] the new man which after God is created
[1:14:49] in righteousness and true Holiness no
[1:14:51] longer is he dealing by ways of the
[1:14:54] flesh that was how he dealt with Israel
[1:14:56] he chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue
[1:14:59] issue Through The Godly Isaac line but
[1:15:01] now out of every Kindred tribe and
[1:15:04] Nation he has purposed a new creation he
[1:15:07] is the first of that creation he was God
[1:15:11] created in the form of man now by his
[1:15:13] Spirit he is creating many sons unto
[1:15:18] himself so think about it when you
[1:15:20] receive the new birth you are born again
[1:15:22] into a new creation
[1:15:25] old things passed away all things have
[1:15:28] now become new this is the new creation
[1:15:31] being spoken of here when he talks about
[1:15:34] the beginning of the creation of God
[1:15:36] Jesus is the firstborn among many
[1:15:38] Brethren the beginning of the creation
[1:15:42] of God the beginning of the church the
[1:15:45] beginning of the Bride he is the
[1:15:48] firstborn he says this was his purpose
[1:15:51] this purpose took form through election
[1:15:54] that is why he could look right down to
[1:15:56] the last age when all would be over and
[1:15:58] see himself still in the midst of the
[1:16:00] church as author of this new creation of
[1:16:03] God his Sovereign power brought it to
[1:16:05] pass by his own decree he elected the
[1:16:08] members of this new creation he
[1:16:10] predestinated them to the adoption of
[1:16:12] children according to the good pleasure
[1:16:14] of his will by his omniscience and
[1:16:16] omnipotence he brought it to pass what
[1:16:20] are you doing
[1:16:21] here how are you still standing why are
[1:16:25] you accepting the message by his
[1:16:28] decree he
[1:16:30] predestinated he elected you and he is
[1:16:34] bringing it to pass my if you could let
[1:16:37] that Revelation strike your soul tonight
[1:16:39] what power could come against you no
[1:16:41] power can make you doubt no power can
[1:16:43] make you fall no power can stop you it's
[1:16:46] him it's his will that you're here it's
[1:16:49] his will that you're going to make it
[1:16:51] it's his decree that you're going to
[1:16:52] Rapture the very reason you're here
[1:16:55] still standing it's his Sovereign will
[1:16:59] he decreed you would be here and here
[1:17:01] you are he decreed there would be a
[1:17:03] church and here you are he decreed there
[1:17:05] would be a Rapture and there will be a
[1:17:08] Rapture and you'll be there he has
[1:17:12] decreed it and his decree cannot be
[1:17:15] stopped
[1:17:18] amen the last section we'll get to
[1:17:21] tonight the message to the leoan church
[1:17:25] I Know Thy works that thou art neither
[1:17:28] cold nor hot I would thou work cold or
[1:17:31] hot so then because Thou Art
[1:17:33] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[1:17:36] spew thee out of my mouth because thou
[1:17:38] sayest I am rich and increase with goods
[1:17:41] and have need of nothing and knowest not
[1:17:43] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[1:17:44] poor and blind and naked I counsel thee
[1:17:47] to buy me gold tried in the fire that
[1:17:49] thou mayest be rich white rment that
[1:17:52] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[1:17:53] shame of thy nakedness knew not of
[1:17:57] here anoint thine eyes with isav that
[1:17:59] thou mayest see as many as I love and
[1:18:02] rebuke as me as I love I rebuke and
[1:18:05] chasen be zealous
[1:18:07] therefore and
[1:18:09] repent in the beginning there well in
[1:18:12] the entire thing but what you find in
[1:18:14] there if you break it down is there's
[1:18:16] two indictments against the
[1:18:18] church first they're neither cold nor
[1:18:21] hot they're lukewarm we dealt with this
[1:18:23] at the very beginning it's the spirit of
[1:18:25] the age it's what's trying to overtake
[1:18:27] you it's what makes you sit there
[1:18:28] lifeless in church it's what makes it
[1:18:30] hard to read your Bible it's what makes
[1:18:32] it hard for you to pray it's what makes
[1:18:34] you go to the movies instead of to the
[1:18:36] message it's
[1:18:38] lukewarmness so it's what it
[1:18:41] is once again I want to make it very
[1:18:43] clear because sometimes kids get it
[1:18:45] twisted I remember sitting in your seat
[1:18:48] um this message ain't about everything
[1:18:51] we're
[1:18:52] against it's about what we're for and
[1:18:54] we're for you overcoming and we're for
[1:18:55] you rapturing we're not here to say
[1:18:58] don't have fun we're not here to say you
[1:19:00] should never have entertainment that's
[1:19:01] not what this is about but you know
[1:19:03] you're lukewarm when that's all your
[1:19:06] life consists
[1:19:08] of that's all we're saying make it very
[1:19:11] clear search Your Own Heart Lord has
[1:19:14] those things taken the place of my
[1:19:16] desire for
[1:19:17] you do I find it almost impossible to
[1:19:20] pray impossible to read my Bible just
[1:19:23] because it's not that I'm a against God
[1:19:25] it's not that I'm against those things
[1:19:27] it's that the hunger for those things
[1:19:28] isn't there or it's lacking or it's been
[1:19:30] covered over by things of the world that
[1:19:33] leads to
[1:19:36] lukewarm and because of that they will
[1:19:38] be spewed out the other indictment they
[1:19:42] say they are rich and have need of
[1:19:43] nothing and do not recognize their need
[1:19:45] of
[1:19:46] God for the sake of time we're just
[1:19:49] going to deal with
[1:19:50] lukewarm we'll pick up the other part
[1:19:53] later
[1:19:56] he says we're going to look at this
[1:19:59] carefully it says that this leoan church
[1:20:02] age group is lukewarm this lukewarmness
[1:20:05] Demands a penalty from
[1:20:07] God the penalty is that they will be
[1:20:10] spewed out of his mouth now I want you
[1:20:12] to understand in this context it's not
[1:20:15] spoken to an individual it's spoken uh
[1:20:18] to the church he's talking to the church
[1:20:21] Collective remember there's always been
[1:20:22] two Vines two churches true and false
[1:20:25] and he's speaking to the church
[1:20:28] here and a lot of people think this is
[1:20:31] well God's going to spew me out and and
[1:20:33] and I guess I guess you could look at it
[1:20:35] this way but as
[1:20:37] individuals the word shows us in many
[1:20:39] places it shows us engraved on the palms
[1:20:41] of his hands it shows us carried in his
[1:20:44] bosom it says that we were in his mind
[1:20:47] it says we're in his Sheepfold but never
[1:20:49] does it speak of you as individuals as
[1:20:51] being in his mouth okay so what is in
[1:20:55] his mouth we covered this in another age
[1:20:57] matter of fact one of the ages showing
[1:20:59] his deity talked about the two-edged
[1:21:01] sword that is in his mouth so so the
[1:21:04] word or the sharp two-edged sword is in
[1:21:07] his mouth and and the word is in his
[1:21:10] mouth and as his body on Earth the word
[1:21:12] is supposed to be in our mouth as well 1
[1:21:15] Peter 4:11 says if any man speak let him
[1:21:18] speak as the Oracle or the word of God
[1:21:23] so brother Brown says what is wrong with
[1:21:25] these people of the last day why are
[1:21:27] they being spewed out they have gotten
[1:21:30] away from the word they are no longer
[1:21:33] fervent about it now just stop for a
[1:21:37] minute and let's all be honest with
[1:21:40] ourselves and ask yourself does this
[1:21:43] describe
[1:21:45] me they are no longer fervent about it
[1:21:49] that's on fire touched by fire let the
[1:21:52] world come and watch me burn
[1:21:55] they are lukewarm about it that
[1:21:58] describes leoda that describes the group
[1:22:02] spewed out of his mouth God is sickened
[1:22:05] by their lack of honor to the word
[1:22:08] they've strayed from the word and they
[1:22:09] replaced it with their own ideas and
[1:22:11] their own Creeds and it has made him
[1:22:13] sick and he says here I'm spewing you
[1:22:15] out like vomit in other words the church
[1:22:20] will no longer speak for me they are no
[1:22:23] longer my mouthpiece because the word is
[1:22:26] not in their mouth she's no longer going
[1:22:29] to represent me if you look at Romans
[1:22:32] 10:8 it says but what saith it the word
[1:22:35] is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in
[1:22:38] thy heart that is the word of faith
[1:22:41] which we preach so yes as individuals we
[1:22:45] are to have his word in our heart and in
[1:22:47] our mouth because he wants us to be used
[1:22:50] as his voice he wants us to represent
[1:22:53] him but but he wants us to elevate his
[1:22:56] word Above All Else he wants it elevated
[1:23:00] above our ideas and he wants to elevated
[1:23:03] above our fears and our complexes and
[1:23:05] and you get to this place where he spews
[1:23:07] the church out and and they're no longer
[1:23:09] his voice but he has called out a people
[1:23:13] he has called out a bride and he has
[1:23:15] placed his voice in Her who is this her
[1:23:19] that's you and he expects you to elevate
[1:23:22] his word and for this word to be what's
[1:23:24] in your mouth for his word to be what
[1:23:26] you honor for his word to be what is
[1:23:29] lifted up he calls a bride out and he
[1:23:31] separates from the church he says this
[1:23:33] church can't speak for me anymore she's
[1:23:36] lukewarm she doesn't honor my word she
[1:23:38] looks to her Creeds and her dogmas so
[1:23:40] I'm calling out another group I'm
[1:23:43] calling out somebody else that will
[1:23:45] speak for me a bride who has received
[1:23:48] the voice of a prophet and then under
[1:23:50] her messenger she is to be the final
[1:23:53] voice to the final age you are supposed
[1:23:56] to be a voice to the world how can you
[1:24:00] be if you blend in with the
[1:24:02] world how can you be if you're saying
[1:24:05] what the world says it's the law of
[1:24:08] contrast come and watch me burn you are
[1:24:11] to be a light burning in the darkness
[1:24:14] you can't be lukewarm about this word
[1:24:17] you can't lay it aside just says well I
[1:24:19] like it and it's church and yeah I
[1:24:21] believe but are you fervent for the word
[1:24:25] is there a passion for the
[1:24:27] word we can't be lukewarm about
[1:24:30] it he says we're a part of it if you're
[1:24:33] a part of the Bride you are because the
[1:24:35] bride is part of the groom you know so
[1:24:38] we find out that it's the same thing
[1:24:39] she'll do just exactly what's predicted
[1:24:41] for her to do in this day she won't be a
[1:24:44] leoa not by no means a lukewarm but
[1:24:48] she'll be on fire for God she'll be
[1:24:52] moving on in the spirit of God brother
[1:24:58] brandham says a momentary consideration
[1:25:00] of church history will prove how
[1:25:02] accurate this thought is in the Dark
[1:25:05] Ages the word was almost entirely lost
[1:25:07] to the people but God sent Luther with
[1:25:09] the word and the Lutheran spoke for God
[1:25:13] at that time but they organized and
[1:25:16] again the pure word was lost to
[1:25:18] organization it tends towards dogma and
[1:25:21] Creeds and not simple word they could no
[1:25:24] longer speak for God then God sent
[1:25:26] Wesley and he was the voice with the
[1:25:28] word in his day the people who took his
[1:25:30] Revelation from God became the living
[1:25:33] Epistles read and known of all men for
[1:25:35] their generation when the Methodist

[1:26:12] taking what you want and leaving Parts
[1:26:13] you don't like we don't have the word so
[1:26:15] we can debate it we don't have the word
[1:26:17] so we can figure out am I allowed to do
[1:26:19] this or am I allowed to do that we have
[1:26:21] the word so it so it can be manifest Ed
[1:26:25] you are to be the living breathing
[1:26:27] manifested word of God and I say tonight

[1:26:59] every single
[1:27:01] day you fight it every single day it
[1:27:04] creeps in it takes over and as we close
[1:27:07] this tonight I just want to say in the
[1:27:09] closing moments of the final age we have
[1:27:11] to shake
[1:27:12] ourselves all of us do we can't we can't

[1:27:17] made it you have to shake yourself every
[1:27:20] single day sir I don't want to identify
[1:27:22] with the lukewarm church I don't want
[1:27:24] want to identify with the leot thean age
[1:27:26] I want to be part of that group that is
[1:27:28] speaking for him on fire for him moving
[1:27:32] on with the spirit he says she'll be on
[1:27:34] fire for God she'll be moving on in the
[1:27:37] spirit of God let that be what the the
[1:27:40] the way evening light Tabernacle is
[1:27:42] described let that describe your life
[1:27:44] let that describe our youth group we're
[1:27:46] on fire for God the whole world may be
[1:27:49] lukewarm it may be going down but as for
[1:27:52] me and my house I'm going to be on fire
[1:27:55] I'm going to have a hunger I'm going to
[1:27:57] move in the spirit when the spirit moves
[1:27:59] I am not a lead of sin I'm not going
[1:28:02] down with Le oia but I've been called
[1:28:04] out of the age into the bride age
[1:28:06] because it's bride time what's that mean
[1:28:09] it's a time where a bride's called out
[1:28:11] prepared for a Rapture that's who you
[1:28:14] are but you got to step into it give it
[1:28:17] your all say I won't be lukewarm I won't

[1:29:34] moment of examining your life that's
