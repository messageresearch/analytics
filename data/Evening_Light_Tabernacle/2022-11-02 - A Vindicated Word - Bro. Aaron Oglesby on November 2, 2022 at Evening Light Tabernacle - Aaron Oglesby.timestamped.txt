[38:44] amen let's talk to him
[38:48] Heavenly Father
[38:49] thou knowest Lord
[38:52] you know every situation here tonight
[38:54] Lord you know the needs of your people
[38:57] you know the downtrodden you know where
[38:59] people need to be encouraged Lord or the
[39:02] list goes on and on because you are
[39:04] infinite you know all Lord I'm asking
[39:06] tonight that you'll just take control of
[39:08] this vessel
[39:09] or that you'll speak to your people Lord
[39:11] that they would be encouraged Lord to
[39:13] face another day to fight on Lord
[39:16] Lord because I know that we're nearing
[39:18] the very end we're at the finish line
[39:19] and yet Lord it seems at that moment
[39:22] when the attack is greatest
[39:24] so Lord increase our courage
[39:26] Lord increase our courage that we can
[39:28] fight Lord and cross that line and take
[39:30] that Rapture that the ages have longed
[39:32] to see we ask you now to take control of
[39:35] this service Lord take control of this
[39:36] vessel May every heart Lord be blessed
[39:39] in your presence may they receive your
[39:41] word Lord as it was given I pray in
[39:43] Jesus name
[39:45] amen and amen
[39:47] if you have your Bibles with you tonight
[39:49] I'd like to
[39:50] get straight into the word by looking at
[39:53] John 5 and 36.
[39:57] John 5 and verse 36.
[40:03] we're going to read several places we're
[40:05] going to read but it'll all be here in
[40:07] the Book of John so we shouldn't have a
[40:09] problem getting to it quickly
[40:11] we're going to read this this one verse
[40:13] it says
[40:14] but I have greater witness than that of
[40:16] John for The Works which the father hath
[40:19] given me to finish the same works that I
[40:23] do bear witness of me that the father
[40:27] had sent me we're going to look over
[40:29] into John 17. and verse 4.
[40:36] what he's saying there is is that
[40:40] John has bore witness of me but even
[40:42] greater than that the works that I'm
[40:44] doing vindicate what I say to be true
[40:49] he says I have glorified thee on Earth
[40:51] I have finished the work which thou gave
[40:54] us me to do
[40:56] and then one more reading where I look
[40:58] at John 14 and 11. John 14 and 11.
[41:02] we're going to read verse 11 and verse
[41:05] 12.
[41:09] it says believe me that I am in the
[41:11] father and the father in me or else
[41:12] believe me for the very Works sake
[41:17] verily verily I say unto you he that
[41:20] believeth on me the works that I do
[41:22] shall he do also in Greater Works than
[41:26] these shall he do because I go unto the
[41:29] father amen I pray the Lord will bless
[41:32] his word tonight as you have your seats
[41:37] I believe that every one of us here
[41:39] tonight as Believers of this end time
[41:42] message understand the importance of
[41:44] vindication
[41:46] as it relates to what we believe even
[41:49] more so than most in the religious world
[41:51] because we believe in a message that
[41:54] most people do not believe we believe
[41:57] something that others would consider
[41:58] different or it's a very small
[42:00] percentage of people who believe like we
[42:02] do and yet we can stand very firm
[42:05] tonight we can stand unashamed we don't
[42:07] have to back up any at all we don't have
[42:10] to be ashamed of the messenger because
[42:13] no matter what other people feel about
[42:14] him no matter what other people feel
[42:16] about this message no matter what
[42:18] people's opinions are the Lord went to
[42:21] Great Lengths to vindicate this message
[42:23] and the messenger so you can stand in
[42:26] confidence tonight you don't have to be
[42:28] ashamed to talk about it you don't have
[42:29] to be ashamed of witness of it because
[42:31] it was Vindicated it was done out in the
[42:33] open it was it was Time After Time After
[42:36] Time the Lord came down and said this is
[42:38] the truth as it has been said many times
[42:41] even as brother Tim has ministered here
[42:43] this message was over the indicated he
[42:47] went above and beyond to make sure there
[42:49] would be no question there was no
[42:52] question that God was in it there was no
[42:54] question that God had sanctioned it
[42:56] there was no question that this message
[42:58] was the truth because night after night
[43:01] we saw the pillar of fire come down and
[43:04] be on display night after night the
[43:06] angel of the Lord came behind that
[43:08] message and gave it a resounding amen
[43:11] all right he came down and and he put
[43:14] his name with it we know as human beings
[43:16] sometimes we don't want to go sign for
[43:18] something if if we can't trust it we
[43:21] don't want to put our name on something
[43:22] that we can't trust and yet Time After
[43:24] Time God would come down and say I'll
[43:27] put my name on this I'll stand behind
[43:29] this what's being said here is the truth
[43:32] and and we know that God will not come
[43:35] and back up or stand behind a lie or a
[43:38] half-truth and vindicate that he's not
[43:41] going to come stand with something
[43:42] that's not 100 percent true but when God
[43:45] comes down down and God begins to do
[43:48] signs and God begins to do wonders
[43:50] amongst his people even to the
[43:52] displaying of the Messiah sign even into
[43:55] the Discerning of the thoughts and
[43:56] intents of the heart when he comes down
[43:59] behind a message and he does those
[44:00] things you can rest your very soul on
[44:03] that message as a matter of fact you
[44:06] better rest your soul on that message
[44:07] because when God comes down and
[44:09] vindicates it that's a message that's
[44:11] going to take you out of here that's a
[44:13] message that you can put your family in
[44:15] that's a message that you can hang your
[44:17] soul on tonight because God came down
[44:19] and said this message is the truth
[44:23] amen he came and he Vindicated it over
[44:26] and over it's it's a message of the
[44:28] Exodus it's a message that will take you
[44:31] from this Earth and that's how God has
[44:33] has done things from the very beginning
[44:35] even with Abel he came down and he
[44:38] Vindicated Abel he Vindicated that what
[44:41] he did was right and it's how God
[44:43] operates he always vindicates and backs
[44:47] up his word he will always do and that's
[44:50] what I'm going to speak to you tonight
[44:51] for a little bit about is a Vindicated
[44:54] word what we believe and what we preach
[44:56] is a Vindicated word because God always
[45:00] vindicates his word he always vindicates
[45:02] his moves and he always vindicates his
[45:05] people and the word vindicate here means
[45:08] to establish and to substantiate to be
[45:11] proven correct to clear from blame guilt
[45:15] or suspicion to justify listen God never
[45:19] leaves it up to his people to figure out
[45:21] well is God doing something here here is
[45:24] is this a move of God I'm not sure this
[45:27] could be this might be but he always
[45:30] comes behind his work to vindicate it
[45:32] and make sure that his people are
[45:34] without question this is the work of God
[45:37] and he didn't get all the way down here
[45:39] to the greatest move of God that the
[45:40] world's ever seen to the Rapture time to
[45:43] lay out a sea when things are evil and
[45:45] Lead things up in the air and leave
[45:46] things to where you had to discern well
[45:48] maybe it's true maybe it's not but he
[45:51] came down in power each and every day
[45:53] and he Vindicated it where you have no
[45:55] question you have no doubt time after
[45:57] time after a Time Beyond doubt this word
[46:00] has been Vindicated
[46:04] one thing I want us to understand as we
[46:06] go forward that God vindicates in in
[46:08] different ways he vindicates with signs
[46:10] he vindicates with wonders and he also
[46:12] vindicates with fulfillment and
[46:15] fulfillment is the greatest Vindication
[46:17] that there is listen Abraham there were
[46:20] many vindications in Abraham's life that
[46:23] he was following God that he had done
[46:25] the right thing by by leaving her and
[46:27] and seeking a city who's whose Builder
[46:30] and maker was God there were many
[46:31] vindications there were great
[46:33] visitations that Vindicated what God was
[46:36] doing through him but the ultimate
[46:38] Vindication of Allah that was the
[46:41] Fulfillment of the promised son that was
[46:44] the ultimate Vindication of his journey
[46:46] that the promised son Isaac had finally
[46:49] arrived because fulfillment is the
[46:52] ultimate Vindication there there have
[46:55] been and there will be more vindications
[46:57] of this message that that God is with us
[47:00] and that this word is the truth but one
[47:03] morning there's going to be the ultimate
[47:05] Vindication one of these mornings all
[47:08] the doubters can take their doubts and
[47:09] keep them all the Skeptics can take
[47:11] their arguments and keep them because
[47:13] one of these days the greatest
[47:15] Vindication that this message is true
[47:18] that's going to come a sweep across your
[47:20] body your loved ones are gonna appear
[47:23] you talk about a Vindication you talk
[47:26] about a justification you talk about
[47:28] removing all doubt when Mama walks in
[47:31] when Daddy walks in you won't have a
[47:34] question then you will be Vindicated
[47:36] this word will be Vindicated
[47:40] when the long-awaited promised son
[47:43] Jesus returns the change of our bodies
[47:47] our loved ones face to face
[47:50] listen I love every sign I love every
[47:52] wonder I love every vindication
[47:54] I want more of that I want those in our
[47:57] daily walk to know that this is God's
[48:00] hand
[48:02] this is God moving amongst us but
[48:04] they're only pointing to the great
[48:06] Vindication they're only pointed to the
[48:10] to the Vindication that every Christian
[48:11] that has stood down through time has
[48:13] stood for
[48:15] the Rapture of the church for everyone
[48:17] that's ever held on this will be
[48:19] Vindication for those who forsook family
[48:22] for those that firstook friends this
[48:24] will be the ultimate vindication
[48:34] I can't wait to we feel that sweet come
[48:36] across our body
[48:41] what a Vindication that's going to be
[48:46] but God doesn't leave us guessing along
[48:48] the way
[48:49] as we're heading towards that he doesn't
[48:51] leave us guessing he vindicates and he
[48:53] proves his word so that we can believe
[48:55] and be in the attitude and and the
[48:57] atmosphere to receive he he vindicates
[49:01] what he's doing so that you won't miss
[49:03] it
[49:04] okay Moses met the burning bush and and
[49:08] but he knew within himself these people
[49:11] know me
[49:12] and he knows they're not going to
[49:14] believe him
[49:15] he knows they're going to have a hard
[49:17] time he knows that they're going to
[49:18] doubt it in Chapter 3 of Exodus the Lord
[49:20] lays it all out to Moses he said here's
[49:23] what's going to happen and you're going
[49:26] to go down and you're going to deliver
[49:27] them and here's exactly what you're
[49:29] going to say to those people and Moses
[49:31] is like
[49:32] no
[49:34] they ain't gonna believe this
[49:37] you don't understand these people know
[49:39] me they know my past
[49:41] they know who I was they know my
[49:43] failures they're not going to accept it
[49:45] when I come save the Lord spoke to me
[49:48] and I am the deliverer Exodus 4 1 and
[49:51] Moses answer and said but behold they
[49:53] will not believe me nor hearken under my
[49:56] voice for they will say the Lord hath
[49:58] not appeared unto thee now I'm going to
[50:02] go off for just a second sometimes we
[50:04] deal with the same thing whenever we
[50:06] have an experience with the Lord there's
[50:07] many times as Sinners that we meet God
[50:09] and we tell all our friends and they say
[50:12] no you're the same old guy no you're the
[50:14] same old person but why what I want to
[50:16] say to you is just let the life that he
[50:18] lives out of you vindicate your claim
[50:20] you don't got to prove nothing to them
[50:22] you don't got to convince them just let
[50:24] your life speak loud enough that they
[50:26] that it vindicates what you say happen
[50:28] happen there's been a change I met the
[50:31] burning bush I'm not the same person I
[50:33] once was and Moses is going back as a
[50:36] different person because brother Branham
[50:38] would say the burning bush had exactly
[50:40] what Moses lacked
[50:42] and so the Lord gives him two signs
[50:45] he gives him the rod and he gives him
[50:47] the sign in the hand
[50:48] and then he tells them and if they still
[50:50] won't believe this then he tells him
[50:52] about how he'll be able to turn the very
[50:54] water of the Nile into blood
[50:56] and what is it that he's declaring to
[50:58] Moses by giving him this in other words
[51:01] if my word is not enough
[51:05] if they won't trust you I'm going to
[51:07] give you this sign then I'm going to
[51:09] give you this sign and if that still
[51:11] isn't enough it's going to come to pass
[51:12] that I'm going to give you another sign
[51:14] what's he saying to him I'm not going to
[51:17] let my people miss it I'm not going to
[51:20] let them miss it this is the message of
[51:22] the Exodus and I'm not going to let it
[51:24] fail I know it's going to be hard to
[51:26] believe I know there's a lot of doubt in
[51:28] the land I know this is an age of
[51:30] unbelief I know you've been in bondage a
[51:33] long time but I'm gonna get the
[51:35] attention of my people I'm gonna do
[51:37] whatever it takes but I'm not gonna let
[51:40] him miss it I'm gonna make sure they
[51:43] believe I'm gonna make sure they're
[51:44] delivered I'm going to make sure they go
[51:46] the promised land I'm not going to leave
[51:48] one behind
[51:49] oh that's exactly what he had to do for
[51:52] Sarah
[51:52] she was sitting there the time was
[51:54] approaching fulfillment was at hand but
[51:57] God was determined I'm not gonna let her
[52:00] miss it she's the one she hasn't caught
[52:03] it yet she doesn't have the faith yet
[52:04] but I'm not gonna let her miss it she's
[52:07] the one that's going to bring forth the
[52:08] promised son she's the one that's part
[52:10] of the promise she is the one I gotta
[52:14] make sure she's on board and he's
[52:15] looking down tonight and he says she's
[52:17] the one she's the one she's going to
[52:20] bring forth the Rapture she's going to
[52:22] bring forth the promised son and I'm not
[52:24] gonna let her miss it I'll do whatever
[52:27] it takes I'll shake hell i'll bankrupt
[52:30] heaven but he's not gonna let you miss
[52:32] it tonight he'll vindicate whatever he
[52:35] has to vindicate he'll move on you again
[52:37] oh but he's moved once he's moved twice
[52:40] he's moved three times he won't let you
[52:42] miss it
[52:44] Hallelujah he's a determined God
[52:47] he's going to make sure you're on board
[52:50] I'll come down myself and turn her heart
[52:52] to believing
[52:55] don't give up on those that hadn't seen
[52:57] it yet
[52:58] don't give up on the ones you've been
[52:59] waiting on
[53:01] don't give up on yourself wherever you
[53:03] find yourself at tonight he isn't giving
[53:05] up on you
[53:07] he isn't giving up on you let that sink
[53:10] down in your heart tonight whatever
[53:11] you're going through whatever your
[53:13] struggle is how many times you failed he
[53:16] is not giving up on you he's not going
[53:19] to let you miss it he's not going to
[53:22] leave you behind you are the one going
[53:24] in the Rapture you are the Overcomers of
[53:26] laodicea you are the ones and he's going
[53:30] to do whatever it takes to get you on
[53:31] board
[53:35] he vindicates Moses
[53:38] but not just with the two signs
[53:41] but time after time on the journey
[53:45] you see the power of the spoken word
[53:47] there as he speaks flies and speaks
[53:49] frogs
[53:50] you see him call the plagues open in the
[53:52] Red Sea
[53:54] water comes forth from The Rock
[53:59] he vindicates Moses on the entire
[54:01] Journey
[54:03] all the way through the wilderness
[54:05] because there isn't just supposed to be
[54:07] Vindication of the power of God and the
[54:10] taking out
[54:11] it's not just going to be vindicating
[54:13] the power of God in the loosing in the
[54:16] setting free from the denominations
[54:18] what good is the setting free if we're
[54:20] going to come out not just like we did
[54:22] there and live just like we did there
[54:23] and have the same power or lack thereof
[54:25] that they did there but all the way to
[54:28] the end all the way to the journey all
[54:31] the way through laodicea all the way
[54:33] through the Wilderness he's still going
[54:34] to vindicate the pillar of fire is still
[54:36] going to be there the power to heal
[54:38] still going to be there the power to
[54:40] save still going to be there he's going
[54:42] to vindicate his power all the way to
[54:45] the promised land
[54:46] listen God didn't just vindicate the
[54:50] message in 1963. God wasn't just with
[54:53] the message in 1965 but the same power
[54:56] that came to vindicate the message is
[54:58] now vindicating itself in the bride
[55:00] today it's still the word it's still the
[55:03] message and it's still Vindicated
[55:05] amongst his people not just then but now
[55:08] tonight Wednesday night and evening like
[55:11] Tabernacle he still vindicates his word
[55:14] the same Miracles the same power the
[55:18] same Pillar of Fire that was there is
[55:20] the same Pillar of Fire that's here
[55:21] tonight vindicating this message this
[55:25] word is the truth
[55:28] foreign
[55:29] the pillar of fire was with them all the
[55:32] way in providing for them in the
[55:33] wilderness
[55:34] that didn't eliminate the trials
[55:37] that didn't eliminate the hardships
[55:40] but the continued Works Vindicated that
[55:43] God was with them every step of the way
[55:48] brother Brown says now the people begin
[55:49] to murmur
[55:51] they fell we don't want to murmur
[55:54] what is the works that Jesus did he said
[55:57] my Works declare me my Works prove who I
[56:01] am my Works vindicate me when God sent
[56:05] Moses The Works Vindicated him when God
[56:07] sent Elijah The Works Vindicated him
[56:10] when God anoints a man his Works
[56:12] vindicate him when God sent the holy
[56:15] ghost in the last day The Works
[56:17] Vindicated
[56:19] listen he didn't bring us out here to
[56:21] leave us all along and go let's see if
[56:23] y'all can make it
[56:25] I know I pulled you out of bondage but
[56:27] now let's just see you're on your own
[56:29] the pillar of fire is going back when
[56:31] it's not going to lead you anymore it's
[56:32] not going to provide for you anymore but
[56:34] the pillar of fire is still amongst us
[56:37] it's still moving in our midst the Manna
[56:39] still Falls The Living Water still flows
[56:42] you can still have your portion of it
[56:44] tonight it's not a past thing
[56:46] Vindication isn't just for the past
[56:48] Vindication is to show you that you can
[56:51] have it Vindication is so that you know
[56:53] he did it once he'll do it again he did
[56:56] it again and now he'll do it again if he
[56:58] did it again he'll do it again he will
[57:00] do it for you tonight and for your needs
[57:03] the Holy Ghost still moves the Holy
[57:06] Ghost still does the miraculous to
[57:08] vindicate what that he is in our midst
[57:15] you know when we get to a place
[57:18] that the signs and the Wonders and the
[57:20] miraculous stop happening
[57:22] we need to worry
[57:26] because where he is his works are made
[57:30] manifest
[57:33] where he is you will see a manifestation
[57:36] of the spirit
[57:37] where the spirit is you will find the
[57:40] fruits of the spirit
[57:41] you will find the works that I do shall
[57:44] you do also so if those Works aren't
[57:47] manifest we need to get very very
[57:49] concerned it is something that we should
[57:51] seek wholeheartedly Lord what is it Lord
[57:54] is it me Lord is it my home I want my
[57:56] home ready I want my home prepared I
[57:59] want you to be able to move in this
[58:00] church Lord don't let me be the
[58:01] hindrance don't let me be the one
[58:03] stopping it Lord search me o God search
[58:06] my attitude search me in the service
[58:08] search me with your word Lord I just
[58:10] want to be right I want you to move I
[58:12] want you to vindicate once more Lord
[58:14] that you're with us that you're amongst
[58:17] us that I'm not alone vindicate yourself
[58:19] to me Lord
[58:23] brother Brown says the Full Gospel
[58:24] preachers may be uneducated
[58:27] they may be illiterate but they got
[58:29] sense enough to know what God is when he
[58:32] comes in their midst they let him have
[58:35] his way and signs and wonders accompany
[58:38] that Ministry hallelujah it's the truth
[58:42] God always always now listen
[58:46] God always vindicates his church by
[58:49] signs and wonders
[58:51] it's always been the sign of God a shout
[58:55] of it in the camp of the king the king
[58:57] is in the camp today as a bunch of
[59:00] people
[59:03] he said the shout of the king is always
[59:06] in the camp and the king is in the camp
[59:09] today as a bunch of people
[59:12] that once again as we spoke last
[59:14] Wednesday puts the responsibility for
[59:16] the works that I do shall you do also
[59:18] squarely on you
[59:21] it puts a responsibility on us and a
[59:24] desire there should be a hunger for us
[59:26] to fulfill exactly what the word said we
[59:28] were going to fulfill
[59:30] he says you'll not say the days of
[59:32] Miracles has passed and no such a thing
[59:34] as Divine Healing with the spirit of the
[59:36] Living God who wrote the Bible in you
[59:38] you can't do it he will vindicate
[59:41] himself then when you see such things
[59:44] going on you'll not criticize that
[59:46] you'll glorify God because the very
[59:49] spirit that wrote them and it's
[59:51] performing them will bear witness of
[59:53] them
[59:54] that's the spirit of the Church of the
[59:57] Living God the Living God living in the
[1:00:00] Living Church
[1:00:01] oh my goodness I want to be a living
[1:00:04] church today I want the Living God
[1:00:06] flowing through a living church and a
[1:00:08] living people with signs and wonders
[1:00:11] following that's who I want to be he
[1:00:14] said that's the Vindication of the
[1:00:17] Living God it's the Living God living
[1:00:20] there and producing what he's always
[1:00:22] produced sometimes people think well
[1:00:25] you're looking to something way out
[1:00:27] there and wake no we're just pointing to
[1:00:29] the Bible saying that's what he's always
[1:00:30] done this is how he's always operated
[1:00:33] this is who he's always been and I'm not
[1:00:36] going to tell him to change I just want
[1:00:37] to be a vessel that says Lord operate
[1:00:40] the way you've always operated move the
[1:00:42] way you've always moved just let me get
[1:00:45] out of the way
[1:00:47] thank you
[1:00:49] God's word will never return unto him
[1:00:51] void
[1:00:54] the things that he promised will come to
[1:00:56] pass no matter the opposition
[1:00:59] but he's got to have someone willing
[1:01:01] he's got to have someone who's a vessel
[1:01:04] that will allow him to operate because
[1:01:06] you're always going to have the doubters
[1:01:09] you're always going to have the Skeptics
[1:01:12] you're always going to have those that
[1:01:13] point out every little flaw well it's
[1:01:15] been this many years and brother Branham
[1:01:17] said this and it hasn't happened
[1:01:19] brother Branham said that and it hasn't
[1:01:22] happened
[1:01:23] time element people
[1:01:28] not operating in an eternal Realm
[1:01:31] if it's said and it's the word of God
[1:01:33] time doesn't matter
[1:01:38] well that hadn't happened yet that's why
[1:01:40] I'm thankful for vindication
[1:01:43] once Vindicated once something is
[1:01:45] Vindicated then I no longer have to
[1:01:48] question it I no longer have to doubt it
[1:01:51] once proven true that I have no reason
[1:01:54] to doubt what is being spoken I'm not
[1:01:57] putting time limits on God
[1:01:59] that's exactly what happened in Elijah's
[1:02:01] day
[1:02:03] people begin to doubt whether or not
[1:02:04] Elisha was actually a true Prophet they
[1:02:07] began to criticize even though they had
[1:02:10] seen God move in his ministry
[1:02:14] even though he had been Vindicated as a
[1:02:17] prophet
[1:02:18] they said well you know Elisha was false
[1:02:22] Elisha was false
[1:02:24] he couldn't have been called of God but
[1:02:26] because he said he would do double the
[1:02:28] Miracles
[1:02:29] he said he was supposed to have a double
[1:02:31] portion but he's one short
[1:02:34] Elisha came up one short
[1:02:38] and they began to criticize
[1:02:42] oh yeah now he was one short he couldn't
[1:02:44] have been called of God
[1:02:46] you know listen I know that all things
[1:02:48] before we count them as true must be
[1:02:51] proven
[1:02:52] it must be Vindicated by God in order to
[1:02:54] be accepted I understand that but the
[1:02:56] Vindication that comes in a Ministry is
[1:02:59] to give you faith for what lies ahead in
[1:03:02] the Unseen
[1:03:03] in other words if it's true if it's true
[1:03:05] if it's true if it's true if it's true
[1:03:07] if it's true if it's truth
[1:03:08] and then there's something that hadn't
[1:03:10] happened yet
[1:03:11] all of this gives you the faith you need
[1:03:14] to hold on for that
[1:03:17] if he's been a Healer been a Healer been
[1:03:18] a Healer been a Healer been a Healer
[1:03:20] been a Healer been a Healer and I'm
[1:03:21] still sick I can hold on for that if you
[1:03:23] say prodigal after protocol after
[1:03:25] protocol after protocol after protocol
[1:03:26] and I still got a prodigal I can hold on
[1:03:28] for that you hear what I'm saying if I
[1:03:31] got a need he's been a need supplier and
[1:03:33] he's supplied for this one supplied for
[1:03:34] this was applied for this it's the
[1:03:35] population I can hold on tonight because
[1:03:38] it gives me the faith the Vindication
[1:03:40] tells me it's going to happen
[1:03:43] I can hold on tonight
[1:03:47] the Miracles already done should have
[1:03:50] let them know that the other one was
[1:03:52] going to happen
[1:03:53] what God's already done should let us
[1:03:56] know that he's going to finish the work
[1:03:58] he's going to take us out of here his
[1:04:00] word has been Vindicated
[1:04:03] but instead the doubters begin to
[1:04:05] criticize
[1:04:07] that's what doubters do
[1:04:09] it's what critical Spirits do
[1:04:12] they're critical they criticize Elisha
[1:04:15] was one short
[1:04:16] I knew he was false
[1:04:18] but there was a word
[1:04:20] that had declared you will have a double
[1:04:22] portion and not even death could stop
[1:04:25] that word from being fulfilled not even
[1:04:28] death could stop that word from being
[1:04:30] Vindicated
[1:04:32] oh he was one short and he passes away
[1:04:34] but we know the story one day
[1:04:36] there's a battle that's been being
[1:04:37] fought and Raiders were coming into the
[1:04:39] land
[1:04:40] and when these soldiers one of their
[1:04:42] buddies had gotten killed
[1:04:44] and so they're trying to tote him along
[1:04:46] he's dead and they're trying to keep him
[1:04:48] from falling into the hands of the enemy
[1:04:49] but it's slowing them all down
[1:04:51] you know sometimes if we just quit
[1:04:53] trying to carry everybody along and try
[1:04:55] to fix every single person's problems
[1:04:57] and we'll just put them somewhere where
[1:04:58] there's some quickening power and just
[1:05:00] put him in those hands got to take care
[1:05:02] of it way better than you ever could
[1:05:04] quit trying to carry him through
[1:05:05] everything quit trying to fix every
[1:05:07] problem and just put them in the hands
[1:05:08] of the one that's got quickening power
[1:05:10] tonight
[1:05:12] so they're trying to carry him and it's
[1:05:13] dragging them down and pretty soon
[1:05:15] they're all going to get caught by the
[1:05:16] enemy
[1:05:18] I'm just being real I don't know
[1:05:20] I'd probably be like I don't know Joe he
[1:05:23] did anyway
[1:05:24] ah
[1:05:26] he ain't gonna be mad at us
[1:05:28] hell no
[1:05:30] if we don't put him somewhere we all
[1:05:33] gonna be dead
[1:05:35] and so they found this cave you know and
[1:05:36] in their hearts really what they don't
[1:05:38] want is the body of their brother to
[1:05:40] fall into the hands of the enemy
[1:05:42] and they find this cave and they say
[1:05:44] this would be good enough this is good
[1:05:46] enough oh they've been saying Elisha was
[1:05:48] one short Elisa was one short oh he
[1:05:51] didn't vindicate he done died he can't
[1:05:53] fulfill it now and they threw him in
[1:05:54] there but there was still quickening
[1:05:56] power on those bones it was the
[1:05:58] quickening power it's going to bring
[1:05:59] those bones up in a resurrection but it
[1:06:01] was on there and they throw him in there
[1:06:03] and they took off running and all of a
[1:06:05] sudden out of nowhere he passed them up
[1:06:07] says come on boys come on listen if we
[1:06:10] could get some quickening power on some
[1:06:12] of these dead Bones tonight if we could
[1:06:14] get some pregnant power on some of these
[1:06:16] dead Bones tonight you might run like we
[1:06:19] ain't never seen you run you might work
[1:06:21] somebody we ain't never seen you worship
[1:06:23] you might pass some of us something that
[1:06:26] gave up on you just get some quick and
[1:06:28] power it'll give you a jump it'll give
[1:06:31] you a shout it'll give you a praise

[1:06:38] and Empower on your bones

[1:06:52] thanks though
[1:06:54] you get some quick and empowered to
[1:06:56] change things
[1:06:58] even in death God Vindicated
[1:07:01] he ain't gonna let one word
[1:07:04] fall to the ground
[1:07:05] you worried about a loved one you
[1:07:07] worried about a financial situation this
[1:07:09] man was dead
[1:07:12] it was past hope but when it's past hope
[1:07:14] that's when quickening power can take
[1:07:16] over a situation that's when my God can
[1:07:19] begin to move
[1:07:22] Hallelujah
[1:07:25] it don't matter how long it's been
[1:07:29] it doesn't matter how dark it gets
[1:07:33] but there it's dark it's loud to see
[1:07:36] it is
[1:07:37] my family's falling apart things are
[1:07:40] difficult
[1:07:41] foreign
[1:07:42] I just ran eight yards and I'm out of
[1:07:44] breath
[1:07:47] I need some quickening power quick
[1:07:53] it doesn't matter how dark it gets
[1:07:56] we're standing on Vindicated word
[1:07:59] we are standing on Vindicated promises
[1:08:02] that's a place that that anchor can take
[1:08:04] hold and you won't be shook you won't be
[1:08:07] rattled because we're on a Vindicated
[1:08:09] word of Vindicated message we have
[1:08:11] nothing to fear
[1:08:13] this message was Vindicated this word is
[1:08:16] Vindicated listen the Saints in the Dark
[1:08:18] Ages went down to death with no fear
[1:08:22] based solely on the fact that in the
[1:08:24] scripture they saw Jesus had Resurrected
[1:08:26] and they knew there is a resurrection
[1:08:29] I can go down without fear I can face
[1:08:31] this because it Vindicated
[1:08:34] there has been no other age that has
[1:08:36] received a message as Vindicated as this
[1:08:38] age we're without excuse if they could
[1:08:41] go down to death with that we can face
[1:08:42] anything in this day we can face
[1:08:44] anything he know we know that this word
[1:08:46] will defeat Satan any place at any time
[1:08:48] you can stand there and face it sickness
[1:08:50] I can face it death I can face it
[1:08:52] financial trouble I can face it
[1:08:54] backslidden family I can face it I can
[1:08:57] face anything because we have a
[1:08:58] Vindicated word with Vindicated promises
[1:09:01] and it was Vindicated around the world
[1:09:03] over and over and over again
[1:09:08] the Israelites had no reason to fear
[1:09:11] anymore once met Moses's message had
[1:09:13] been Vindicated
[1:09:14] once Moses demonstrated that he had been
[1:09:17] with God
[1:09:19] and that God was with him
[1:09:22] once that became Vindicated there was no
[1:09:24] need for them to worry anymore
[1:09:26] the lord loves it whenever we take his
[1:09:28] Vindication and we trust in that
[1:09:30] Vindication in order to go forward
[1:09:33] he would tell them over and over and get
[1:09:34] frustrated with him in the Old Testament
[1:09:36] because they forgot because they forgot
[1:09:37] because they forgot that he had
[1:09:39] Vindicated and he had Vindicated and he
[1:09:41] had Vindicated and they forgot and they
[1:09:43] forgot wherever you're at today do not
[1:09:45] forget that this word is Vindicated that
[1:09:48] this Prophet was Vindicated that this
[1:09:49] message was Vindicated that our God has
[1:09:51] been Vindicated that he is true and he
[1:09:53] is faithful it is Vindicated there's no
[1:09:56] reason to back up there's no reason to
[1:09:58] be to be fearful when Moses got there to
[1:10:00] the Red Sea God expected him to know how
[1:10:03] to respond because of the previous
[1:10:06] vindications
[1:10:07] he expected him to know how to handle
[1:10:10] himself don't fear he said you've seen
[1:10:13] what I've done you know what I promise
[1:10:16] now expect me to do it again
[1:10:18] expect me to do it again expect him to
[1:10:22] move for you tonight expect him to do
[1:10:24] the miraculous tonight expect him to go
[1:10:26] beyond what you could even expect expect
[1:10:29] it tonight he says you spoke flies you
[1:10:33] spoke frogs now speak a pathway
[1:10:36] come on now whatever you're facing he
[1:10:38] spoke in your life before he's moved
[1:10:41] like that before in your life just
[1:10:42] expecting to speak a pathway tonight
[1:10:44] expect him to open that situation up
[1:10:46] expect him to move in ways you can't
[1:10:48] even imagine expect it tonight because
[1:10:51] of what he is Vindication because of
[1:10:54] what he has Vindicated
[1:10:57] we have to operate as a people who have
[1:10:59] witnessed the Vindication of the Lord
[1:11:02] he did it once he's going to do it again
[1:11:04] he saved others he's going to save mine
[1:11:08] he's moved for others he's going to move
[1:11:09] from me he's healed others he's going to
[1:11:11] heal me he acted like that in the book
[1:11:12] of Acts he's going to act like that
[1:11:13] again now he's Vindicated himself we've
[1:11:17] seen his Vindication and we desire more
[1:11:19] of it
[1:11:20] it's not just a past thing because
[1:11:23] brother Branham says that's how he
[1:11:25] vindicates his church
[1:11:26] so it must be present and amongst us now
[1:11:29] Vindication of the word is more than
[1:11:31] just Vindication of the word past
[1:11:34] it's more than that but it lets us know
[1:11:37] that if Satan couldn't stop him then he
[1:11:39] can't stop you now if he couldn't stop
[1:11:41] The Exodus then he can't stop the Exodus
[1:11:44] now if he couldn't keep Lazarus in a
[1:11:46] tomb he can't keep your loved ones in a
[1:11:48] tomb if he couldn't stop it then he
[1:11:50] can't stop it now what are you saying
[1:11:52] I'm saying we're going to make it
[1:11:54] we're gonna overcome we're gonna Rapture
[1:11:57] he can't stop it he's never been able to
[1:12:01] stop it that's Vindicated that's word
[1:12:04] that's truth he can't stop us now
[1:12:08] Hallelujah
[1:12:10] brother Brown says now notice a man can
[1:12:13] be ever so fundamental in his Doctrine
[1:12:16] he can be ever so sincere in his heart
[1:12:19] he says I hope this sinks deep
[1:12:21] but unless God confirms it it's no good
[1:12:26] God vindicates
[1:12:28] God has always from back at the
[1:12:31] beginning from Abel Plum on to the end
[1:12:33] over here in Revelation you'll find out
[1:12:36] that God vindicates his church with
[1:12:39] signs and wonders
[1:12:41] as the Believers
[1:12:44] he says and today the churches you
[1:12:46] preach that Doctrine they take the
[1:12:48] confirmation is a man that goes to
[1:12:50] church now listen these are all
[1:12:51] wonderful things
[1:12:52] this describes a lot of people in a lot
[1:12:55] of churches
[1:12:58] a man that goes to church he's good
[1:13:00] quiet religious type Pays His tithes
[1:13:03] supporter of the church believes in the
[1:13:05] church brother that's no sign at all
[1:13:09] no sign
[1:13:11] that's the world's sign
[1:13:15] he says but God's sign is what he said
[1:13:20] it was amen well what's that sign
[1:13:24] what was I say if that's not it it's not
[1:13:26] what's that sign these signs shall
[1:13:28] follow them that belief Mark 16. they
[1:13:32] shall lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:13:33] recover Joel Joel says that I'm gonna
[1:13:36] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh they
[1:13:38] shall speak in new tongues those are the
[1:13:40] signs that he said the world says just
[1:13:42] be a believer just pay your tithes just
[1:13:44] make sure you come to church and he says
[1:13:46] that's no sign at all but a Vindication
[1:13:49] of a real believer is that the signs
[1:13:51] that I do the works that I do shall you
[1:13:54] do also he says that's the Vindication
[1:13:58] of the Living Church
[1:14:01] that's how he vindicates his church and
[1:14:04] that's why we can't be passive about
[1:14:07] these things
[1:14:09] that's why we preach it so hard that's
[1:14:11] why we're always hitting on it because
[1:14:13] when those vindications are absent you
[1:14:16] have to ask
[1:14:17] why
[1:14:22] this is a Vindicated word it's supposed
[1:14:24] to brother Brown says over and over and
[1:14:25] over again it will vindicate itself
[1:14:30] why
[1:14:34] and even worse and even greater
[1:14:36] indictment is when they aren't there
[1:14:39] and they're not wanted
[1:14:42] when they're not there they reject the
[1:14:44] Vindication of his presence and
[1:14:46] therefore they are rejecting the pillar
[1:14:49] of Fire
[1:14:50] go back and listen to the tape and when
[1:14:52] the pillar of fire was present listen to
[1:14:55] the things that happen
[1:14:58] and now if you don't want those things
[1:15:00] you are directly saying we don't want
[1:15:03] that
[1:15:05] brother Branham says it's a rejection of
[1:15:08] the Holy Ghost
[1:15:11] listen
[1:15:13] because I can hear this now I know we're
[1:15:16] not to seek after science
[1:15:18] I know that 100 that's totally backwards
[1:15:20] that's opposite
[1:15:22] Wicked and adulterous generation seeks
[1:15:25] after a sign but it's very clear that
[1:15:27] the signs should follow
[1:15:30] you say well we are believers that's
[1:15:33] where we rest our our soul was anchored
[1:15:37] in the word 100 percent
[1:15:39] then where's the works
[1:15:42] because these signs shall follow
[1:15:47] shall that's unquestionable
[1:15:51] they have to be there
[1:15:54] we know that Jesus came to the Earth and
[1:15:55] I'm gonna go through this quickly as I
[1:15:57] try to get to a certain point Jesus came
[1:15:59] to the Earth
[1:16:00] and in so doing he Vindicated or
[1:16:03] fulfilled the entire Old Testament
[1:16:05] every type every story every scripture
[1:16:08] and we've already said that fulfillment
[1:16:10] is the ultimate Vindication he fulfilled
[1:16:13] Genesis 3 15 the bruising of the
[1:16:15] Serpent's head his birth Vindicated
[1:16:17] Isaiah 7 14. he Vindicated Psalms 22 and
[1:16:21] 1. my God my God why hast Thou forsaken
[1:16:24] me pierced his hands poured his garments
[1:16:26] he was Emmanuel he did not see
[1:16:27] corruption we could go on and on and on
[1:16:29] the list is forever of the things that
[1:16:32] he fulfilled because he fulfilled it all
[1:16:33] but there are very specific things that
[1:16:36] you can point to and and he goes about
[1:16:37] casting out Devils Healing The Sick
[1:16:39] opening the blind eyes and we see here
[1:16:42] in John 10 22 it says and it was at
[1:16:43] Jerusalem the Feast of the dedication
[1:16:46] and it was winter
[1:16:48] and Jesus walked in the temple in
[1:16:49] Solomon's porch then came the Jews round
[1:16:52] about him and said unto him how long
[1:16:54] does thou make us to doubt if thou be
[1:16:56] the Christ tell us plainly
[1:17:00] they answered their own question
[1:17:05] because they doubt
[1:17:07] how long are we going to keep doubting
[1:17:08] you he could have easily said I don't
[1:17:10] know how long are you going to keep
[1:17:10] doubting
[1:17:12] but he says tell us plainly Jesus
[1:17:15] answered said I told you and you
[1:17:17] believed not the works that I do in my
[1:17:20] father's name they bear witness of me
[1:17:25] Jesus tells them even if you don't
[1:17:27] believe what I'm saying The Works
[1:17:30] vindicate Who I Am The Works vindicate
[1:17:34] what I'm telling you to be the truth the
[1:17:36] signs Vindicated the miraculous
[1:17:38] vindicates it the Wonders Vindicated and
[1:17:41] how can we then say we don't need those
[1:17:43] things if we're bone of his bone flesh
[1:17:45] of his flesh she is him the signs will
[1:17:47] vindicate it The Works will vindicate it
[1:17:50] even if the world doesn't believe what
[1:17:51] we're saying believe us for the work's
[1:17:54] sake because the miraculous will
[1:17:56] vindicate it
[1:17:58] brother Branham says when the Holy Ghost
[1:18:00] itself here to Bear record of this hour
[1:18:03] Jesus said so he's the same yesterday
[1:18:05] today and forever how dare any man to
[1:18:08] wipe that out of there
[1:18:10] The Works that I do shall you do also
[1:18:13] John 14 12 these signs shall follow them
[1:18:16] that believe that is the Assurance now
[1:18:19] listen
[1:18:20] because I've heard this
[1:18:23] not said like this how about that
[1:18:26] that is the Assurance when we see a
[1:18:29] group of people sitting together and
[1:18:32] those signs manifesting themselves
[1:18:34] that's the assurance that the abstract
[1:18:37] is there to vindicate that that's
[1:18:40] property of God
[1:18:45] the Assurance when we see a group of
[1:18:47] people sitting together and those signs
[1:18:49] manifesting themselves that's the
[1:18:51] assurance that the abstract is there to
[1:18:53] vindicate that's the property of God I'd
[1:18:56] like to know what year Easter seal 1965.
[1:19:02] he says God wants to perform his word by
[1:19:04] his power and when the church denies his
[1:19:07] power how can he perform and vindicate
[1:19:09] his word when the church explains it
[1:19:11] away and says it's for some other day
[1:19:12] how can God who wants to fulfill his
[1:19:15] word and perform his word amongst the
[1:19:17] people and the people deny that he does
[1:19:19] it yet they go through all the rituals
[1:19:22] here's what happened God wants to
[1:19:24] perform by the Holy Ghost and vindicate
[1:19:26] his word and the church wants to perform
[1:19:30] he said the church wants to perform they
[1:19:33] have to deny the Holy Ghost he says
[1:19:37] when the Lord's wanting to move he's
[1:19:40] wanting to perform but they want to
[1:19:42] perform in their ritual no this is how
[1:19:43] we sing we sing this many songs oh but
[1:19:46] the spirit's moving no it's time for the
[1:19:48] preacher to come out but the spirit's
[1:19:50] moving yeah but it's almost 115 and
[1:19:52] we're normally shutting down about now
[1:19:54] oh but the spirit's move and then it's
[1:19:56] two o'clock and we've seen longer in the
[1:19:57] second song service than we did in the
[1:19:58] first song service
[1:20:00] but the spirit's moving but the church
[1:20:02] wants to perform
[1:20:04] the church wants the ritual of we
[1:20:06] believe the message and they deny the
[1:20:10] Holy Ghost
[1:20:14] he wants to perform by the Holy Ghost to
[1:20:16] vindicate his word in this hour and yet
[1:20:18] the church wants to perform their
[1:20:20] rituals
[1:20:21] you say what I believe the message well
[1:20:23] if you do then the life of the message
[1:20:25] will be found in you
[1:20:28] the life of the message will be preached
[1:20:30] the Dynamics of the message will be
[1:20:33] preached
[1:20:34] you can't pick and choose what part of
[1:20:37] the message you want to preach to fit
[1:20:38] your narrative or what it is you want to
[1:20:41] believe because God will always
[1:20:43] vindicate his word by the power of the
[1:20:46] Holy Ghost with the demonstrations of
[1:20:49] the Holy Ghost
[1:20:51] you must have it in order for it to be
[1:20:53] Vindicated
[1:20:54] you must have the Dynamics backing up
[1:20:56] the mechanics
[1:20:58] brother Brown says God Is Right his word
[1:21:00] is Right others are not right he said
[1:21:03] that's right as long as they can stay
[1:21:05] with the word but when you leave the
[1:21:07] word then you leave God because God is
[1:21:09] watching over his word to vindicate it
[1:21:13] he's got to make it real he's got to
[1:21:16] make it act he says that's why you
[1:21:20] people are hungering for a Revival it's
[1:21:22] time for these things to be here if you
[1:21:25] ever believe me to know what I'm talking
[1:21:27] about you accept that
[1:21:31] that's a powerful statement oh is this
[1:21:34] from the seals no no he says that's why
[1:21:36] you people are hungering for a Revival
[1:21:38] it's time for these things to be here if
[1:21:41] you ever believe me to know what I'm
[1:21:43] talking about you accept that the hour
[1:21:46] is here now that's why we preach healing
[1:21:50] that's why we preach Deliverance that's
[1:21:52] why we can accept tones and
[1:21:53] interpretation that's why we can dance
[1:21:55] in the spirit that's why we can worship
[1:21:57] freely he said the time is now these
[1:22:00] things are to be here now and these
[1:22:02] things vindicate that you are the
[1:22:04] property of God
[1:22:06] [Music]
[1:22:08] he's vindicating now
[1:22:11] it's in his word and he watches over his
[1:22:14] word to vindicate it but it can't
[1:22:16] vindicate itself If you deny it
[1:22:19] how can you know he can Vindicated in
[1:22:21] others but he can't vindicate it in you
[1:22:23] if you deny it to be the truth he can't
[1:22:26] vindicate it in your church if you won't
[1:22:28] let it operate
[1:22:30] we believe the word yes and we must
[1:22:32] preach the whole word if we want to see
[1:22:34] that word Vindicated well we haven't
[1:22:36] seen vindications has it been preached
[1:22:39] when we don't have the moving of the
[1:22:40] spirit has it been preached well we
[1:22:42] agree with those things we just don't
[1:22:44] ever see it here there's a big
[1:22:45] difference between agreeing and
[1:22:48] supporting and fostering
[1:22:55] God will not identify with a place or a
[1:22:58] people where the word is pushed out and
[1:23:00] the power of it is not allowed to
[1:23:01] operate
[1:23:03] these are strong words but these are
[1:23:04] coming from the message of the hour
[1:23:08] will we believe the word that's exactly
[1:23:09] what I'm trying to get you to do just
[1:23:11] stay with the word and let the word live
[1:23:16] it's not a dead word it's a Living Word
[1:23:18] let it do what the word says it will do
[1:23:20] well you're trying to manifest I'm not
[1:23:22] trying to manufacture nothing as a
[1:23:23] matter of fact I don't want anything
[1:23:24] that is manufactured I don't want
[1:23:26] nothing that is worked up I don't want
[1:23:29] nothing that is pure 100 emotion with
[1:23:32] with no Spirit moving and I don't want
[1:23:34] those things what I'm saying is preach
[1:23:36] the word and then let the word vindicate
[1:23:37] itself preach the word and let the word
[1:23:40] do what the word said it will do let the
[1:23:42] word do what the word said it will do
[1:23:44] the word said you can rejoice and dance
[1:23:46] and the word said you can shout the word
[1:23:48] said there'll be tongues the word says
[1:23:50] they'll be healing the word says
[1:23:51] there'll be a shout of the king and the
[1:23:53] camp we believe the word then believe
[1:23:55] that let that be Vindicated amongst you
[1:23:58] to prove that you believe the word today
[1:24:03] stop hindering it
[1:24:06] Let it Loose
[1:24:08] as I was driving out to Amarillo last
[1:24:10] week I began to notice something we
[1:24:12] don't have in Louisiana
[1:24:14] big giant wind turbines
[1:24:17] we don't have those here you wanna know
[1:24:19] why
[1:24:21] there's stuff in the way
[1:24:23] there's stuff that hinders the moving of
[1:24:27] the Wind
[1:24:28] but out there there's nothing in the way
[1:24:29] it's they can put those things up and
[1:24:32] the wind just blows and they take that
[1:24:33] wind and they harness the power of it
[1:24:35] and they put it to use
[1:24:36] oh
[1:24:38] come on now it's time we tear down some
[1:24:40] of the things in the way we tear down
[1:24:42] some of the hindrances and we let the
[1:24:44] wind begin to start blowing and when it
[1:24:46] starts blowing you can harness the power
[1:24:47] you can move in the spirit you can put
[1:24:50] that power to use the sick will be
[1:24:52] healed the bound will be delivered
[1:24:54] there's too much stuff in the way
[1:24:55] there's too many trees and too many
[1:24:57] ideas and too many critical Spirits lay
[1:25:00] it down and let the wind blow harness
[1:25:03] the power of the Holy Ghost and put it
[1:25:05] to use to put every devil to fight
[1:25:07] tonight
[1:25:09] cut down all the hindrances let the Holy
[1:25:13] Spirit
[1:25:14] begin to move
[1:25:19] God sent a message in this day and as we
[1:25:21] have said it was Vindicated
[1:25:24] brother Brown says if I was dying right
[1:25:25] here in this building right now
[1:25:29] and over this next few minutes I just
[1:25:31] want this to encourage us
[1:25:33] something we can anchor to when the wind
[1:25:35] blows
[1:25:37] he said if this would be my last service
[1:25:40] my testimony is true
[1:25:43] the church knows it Millions many
[1:25:46] millions of people around the world and
[1:25:48] how they searched and tried and
[1:25:50] agnostics and unbelievers and Science
[1:25:52] and laws and everything else has went
[1:25:54] through it everywhere and tried to tear
[1:25:56] it apart
[1:25:57] and every time God comes right back and
[1:25:59] vindicates it in power
[1:26:01] and then the scientific World went in to
[1:26:03] find it and God pictured it Yonder
[1:26:05] showed it to him and there they are
[1:26:07] tonight and stands as a memorial to ring
[1:26:09] out as long as there is a Christian
[1:26:11] civilization there it is Yonder now in
[1:26:14] Washington D.C
[1:26:16] foreign
[1:26:17] the world has attacked it
[1:26:19] backsliders have attacked it
[1:26:21] anti-message Spirits have attacked it
[1:26:26] and yet Vindicated
[1:26:27] Vindicated I look around the very
[1:26:30] condition of the world vindicates this
[1:26:31] message almost more than anything else I
[1:26:33] look around and go yep he was right he
[1:26:35] was right he was right he was right he
[1:26:36] was right so guess what that Vindication
[1:26:38] lets me know it's going to be right it's
[1:26:39] going to be right it's going to be right
[1:26:41] going to be right going to be right
[1:26:42] going to be right it's going to keep
[1:26:43] being right until one morning the final
[1:26:45] Vindication strikes it's not going to
[1:26:48] fail it's never failed it's not going to
[1:26:49] start now it's going to continue to be
[1:26:51] right and continue to vindicate itself
[1:26:55] and yet through all these attacks I look
[1:26:57] at it and I I can't imagine anything
[1:26:59] more Vindicated
[1:27:01] than this message
[1:27:03] over and over brother Brown would stand
[1:27:06] and say if I told you the truth
[1:27:08] let him come confirm it
[1:27:10] time after time he would ask audiences
[1:27:12] of thousands if anybody knows of
[1:27:14] anything I've ever said wrong
[1:27:16] and you got to understand these were
[1:27:18] people that did not like him
[1:27:21] that did not support him that would have
[1:27:23] loved the opportunity to call him out
[1:27:27] and you listen and all you hear is
[1:27:29] crickets
[1:27:31] come on up
[1:27:35] oh but let that generation start to pass
[1:27:37] off the scene
[1:27:39] the ones who knew better than to
[1:27:40] challenge him let all the witnesses be
[1:27:42] gone then suddenly well this didn't
[1:27:43] happen and that didn't happen what's
[1:27:45] funny because the people that were with
[1:27:46] him never testified to that
[1:27:49] they never said it didn't happen as a
[1:27:50] matter of fact I was on a website the
[1:27:51] other day it was some type of
[1:27:53] Pentecostal website and and they were
[1:27:55] interviewing different ones
[1:27:57] um Aaron Baxter and several other
[1:27:59] brothers that you would recognize their
[1:28:01] name if I could recall them
[1:28:03] and they were ones who were saying that
[1:28:05] brother Branham got off at the end and
[1:28:07] that's why they had separated in their
[1:28:09] association with him
[1:28:10] and then this is years after brother
[1:28:12] Brown was gone so there was no fear of
[1:28:14] hurting his feelings
[1:28:15] and they would ask him they would say
[1:28:18] so what about all the other stuff
[1:28:20] all the discernments and the healings
[1:28:22] and the Miracles they say oh no no no
[1:28:25] every one of those was real so you never
[1:28:27] saw it fail never one time these are
[1:28:32] people saying oh yeah yeah we don't
[1:28:33] agree with him but never one time did it
[1:28:38] ever for what about in personal car
[1:28:39] rides what about things he told you
[1:28:41] personally never one time
[1:28:46] you can rest your anchor you can anchor
[1:28:49] down on this message
[1:28:51] it's Vindicated
[1:28:52] it never failed Time After Time brother
[1:28:55] Brown says now look where the drama sets
[1:28:58] the Bible is going to be found to be
[1:28:59] truth or error I'm going to be found a
[1:29:02] false prophet or telling you the truth
[1:29:03] if I tell the truth God will vindicate
[1:29:06] the truth if I tell a lie God will show
[1:29:08] that it's a lie but his word can't lie
[1:29:11] that's the reason I'm sure I'm positive
[1:29:13] I'm telling you the word of the lord
[1:29:15] it's God's promise now believe let's see
[1:29:18] what he will say
[1:29:20] thousands of Miracles
[1:29:23] thousands of discernments Visions
[1:29:25] phenomenal things death healed blind
[1:29:28] healed mind restored dead raised
[1:29:30] Vindicated authenticated whatever word
[1:29:33] you want to come up with
[1:29:34] all doubt removed all suspicion removed
[1:29:37] doctor statements
[1:29:39] but the person says what a moment what a
[1:29:40] moment see God the word is the truth and
[1:29:43] the word is going to be found either I'm
[1:29:45] a false witness of the word or I've told
[1:29:47] the truth God will vindicate that word
[1:29:49] is the truth that's right God will have
[1:29:52] nothing to do with a lie you know that
[1:29:55] how can people look at the Vindication
[1:29:57] and deny the message
[1:29:59] night after night he would speak and
[1:30:01] bring forth the message and declare it
[1:30:03] was true and then God would come down
[1:30:05] right after he spoke with signs and
[1:30:07] wonders vindicating
[1:30:09] he would come down and have his picture
[1:30:10] taken there would be Angels come down in
[1:30:13] a cloud
[1:30:14] there would be a king's sword come down
[1:30:16] in the Sabino Canyon wait wait brother
[1:30:18] Aaron wait a minute now these things
[1:30:20] aren't facts these things that you're
[1:30:21] mentioning now they're questionable not
[1:30:23] to me
[1:30:24] they're not questionable because let's
[1:30:26] reiterate this one time if it was
[1:30:27] Vindicated it was Vindicated it was
[1:30:29] Vindicated that he was a truth teller a
[1:30:30] truth teller a true teller a truth
[1:30:32] teller then I can rest on this right
[1:30:34] here I can also see the fruits that It
[1:30:36] produced I can also see God coming in
[1:30:38] behind it and vindicating it with signs
[1:30:40] and wonders and movements of the spirit
[1:30:42] so I don't have to question these things
[1:30:44] aren't questionable to me because the
[1:30:46] message was Vindicated and the messenger
[1:30:47] was Vindicated and God said amen every
[1:30:50] single time he preached
[1:30:52] standing in the Gap 1963. I'd recommend
[1:30:55] every one of you listen to it
[1:30:58] brother Brown tells in great detail of
[1:31:00] the cloud and the experience with the
[1:31:02] angels
[1:31:03] he tells of the king's sword in Sabina
[1:31:05] Canyon
[1:31:06] he tells of the dream with his
[1:31:08] brother-in-law Fletcher
[1:31:11] and how the Lord tells him if he carries
[1:31:13] out his plans he's going to be a bum
[1:31:15] and that's where he saw those men in the
[1:31:17] restaurant and Billy says Danny that
[1:31:19] looks like you you and Fletcher all this
[1:31:20] is in the same sermon
[1:31:23] that's where the Lord speaks to him and
[1:31:25] tells him you forgot the feeling of the
[1:31:26] people you forgot
[1:31:28] that I called what I called you to
[1:31:31] and then he tells about the Seven Peaks
[1:31:33] and the angel asking him how many
[1:31:34] letters are in his name b-r-a-n-h-a-m
[1:31:39] and then there's three outstanding Peaks
[1:31:40] and he says it's the first pull the
[1:31:42] second pool in the third pool there's a
[1:31:45] lot going on in this message there's a
[1:31:48] lot of amazing outstanding things that
[1:31:51] we hold to be true being told right here
[1:31:53] in this message he tells all these
[1:31:55] things and then at the very end of the
[1:31:57] service literally as he says let's bow
[1:31:59] our heads brother Wade Falls dead of a
[1:32:01] heart attack
[1:32:03] he just laid out all these things
[1:32:07] and brother Wade Falls dead of a heart
[1:32:08] attack now to a skeptic that might be
[1:32:10] like well see
[1:32:12] death right there in the middle of it
[1:32:15] death right there in the middle you
[1:32:17] listen oh it's just the opposite you
[1:32:19] talk about vindication you talk about
[1:32:21] God coming to back up everything that
[1:32:23] was just said the Lord knew how amazing
[1:32:26] these stories were
[1:32:27] he knew how difficult it would be for
[1:32:30] some people to believe he knew there
[1:32:32] would be questions
[1:32:34] he knew this sounds amazing outstanding
[1:32:37] almost I've never heard anything like
[1:32:39] this there's Peaks and your names in the
[1:32:41] Peaks and there's three mountains and
[1:32:42] it's these pools and and then he tells
[1:32:44] you're going to be a bum like your
[1:32:45] brother-in-law and then a sword came in
[1:32:47] your what
[1:32:50] imagine what it sounded like to people
[1:32:51] hearing this for the first time
[1:32:53] imagine how to tell us that's just
[1:32:55] common knowledge that's things we know
[1:32:56] and things we believe and trust him
[1:32:57] because it's Vindicated
[1:32:59] but brother Wade Falls dead right there
[1:33:01] in the service and this is the end of it
[1:33:03] right here and you hear it on tape it's
[1:33:05] outstanding what's really outstanding is
[1:33:06] to hear the calm that brother Branham
[1:33:08] deals with the situation with
[1:33:10] but he says let us pray
[1:33:12] brother and then it says a sister in the
[1:33:15] congregation cries out someone fainted
[1:33:17] just a minute sit still everybody see
[1:33:19] says brother brown leaves the pulpit
[1:33:21] goes down into the congregation heavenly
[1:33:24] father let thy mercy and goodness be
[1:33:26] with brother way in the name of Jesus
[1:33:28] Christ may he come back give him back
[1:33:31] lord and give him strength and health
[1:33:33] and he says so help me his heart starts
[1:33:34] beating again be still everybody and
[1:33:37] just pray Lord Jesus let that goodness
[1:33:40] and mercy be with brother away in the
[1:33:41] name of Jesus Christ it's over as I
[1:33:44] stand here on this altar where funerals
[1:33:46] has been preached where I stand here
[1:33:47] where hundreds of people has prayed
[1:33:49] through to Christ I reached out his eyes
[1:33:51] were set his post was gone and no more
[1:33:53] than I called the name of Jesus Christ
[1:33:55] and his post started coming back again
[1:33:57] praise the Lord praise the Lord as a
[1:33:59] minister of the cross I say that in the
[1:34:01] name of Jesus Christ isn't he wonderful
[1:34:05] The Giver of Life the creator of heavens
[1:34:07] and earth in that moment said I'll back
[1:34:09] this up I'll back this word up I'll
[1:34:11] stand behind this Prophet this message
[1:34:14] is true this message is truth a man dies
[1:34:17] and he comes down and he restores life
[1:34:19] why so you can anchor your soul that God
[1:34:23] back this message up he won't back up a
[1:34:26] lie but he backed this up and he
[1:34:28] Vindicated it
[1:34:30] he brought a man back to life
[1:34:34] he raises him from the dead why it's the
[1:34:37] Exodus message and he's not gonna let
[1:34:40] you miss it but he's going to vindicate
[1:34:42] it and Vindicated and Vindicated service
[1:34:45] after service until the prophet leaves
[1:34:47] no until we leave it's going to be
[1:34:50] Vindicated on Wednesday and Sunday and
[1:34:53] Wednesday and Monday at home and Tuesday
[1:34:55] at home in every situation you face he
[1:34:58] will vindicate his word is the truth
[1:35:01] foreign
[1:35:06] the people has to believe
[1:35:08] we're going to start bringing this down
[1:35:09] now
[1:35:14] we can't leave anyone behind and God's
[1:35:16] going to Great extremes to get all that
[1:35:18] are his
[1:35:19] and it caught your attention
[1:35:22] and you knew that this was more than a
[1:35:23] man you knew this was God and in that
[1:35:25] word quick into that seed in your heart
[1:35:28] it became alive
[1:35:30] he wouldn't let you miss it why did it
[1:35:32] Quicken something
[1:35:33] because there was something in you to
[1:35:35] Quicken
[1:35:36] there was something there
[1:35:39] back to John 10 and 25 Jesus answered
[1:35:41] them said I told you and you believe not
[1:35:42] the works that I do in my father's name
[1:35:44] they bear witness of me
[1:35:46] but you believe not because you were not
[1:35:49] of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep
[1:35:53] hear my voice and I know them and they
[1:35:55] follow me
[1:35:56] John 12 36 while you have light believe
[1:35:59] in the light that ye may be Children of
[1:36:01] the light these things spake Jesus and
[1:36:03] departed and hid himself from them but
[1:36:05] though he had done so many miracles
[1:36:07] before them yet they believed not on him
[1:36:13] there was nothing in them to be
[1:36:16] quickened by the Vindication of the word
[1:36:20] it didn't matter how much they saw
[1:36:22] they would explain it away
[1:36:24] it didn't matter how much they saw they
[1:36:26] had an answer brother Branham says the
[1:36:28] Dynamics if it comes upon water it'll
[1:36:30] just splutter
[1:36:32] days of Miracles past
[1:36:35] oh I believe the Bible
[1:36:37] but there ain't no
[1:36:41] but when he hits that 1000 octane
[1:36:44] away she goes you see how my the
[1:36:48] Dynamics strike that but if it strikes a
[1:36:50] chicken it won't do no good
[1:36:53] but when it strikes the eagle he moves
[1:36:56] out amen because the Dynamics with the
[1:36:58] mechanics see what I mean if he's a true
[1:37:00] Eagle now he will understand what are
[1:37:03] you saying I'm saying that true seed
[1:37:05] responds a certain way to Dynamics true
[1:37:07] seed operates a certain way when the
[1:37:10] spirit begins to move the chicken says
[1:37:15] but the true Eagle begins to feel
[1:37:16] something stirring he begins to feel
[1:37:19] something going and there's a little
[1:37:20] excitement because oh excitement that's
[1:37:22] emotional then I get emotional because I
[1:37:24] began to get a little excited I say oh
[1:37:25] that's my father that's moving oh I
[1:37:27] recognize that win that's the same wind
[1:37:29] that came the day I was filled with the
[1:37:30] Holy Ghost oh I recognize that when he
[1:37:32] begins to move and it begins to stir and
[1:37:34] it hits that thousand octane seed on the
[1:37:36] inside of me and when it hits me it says
[1:37:38] off she goes
[1:37:40] because there's something in you to
[1:37:42] Quicken there's something that responds
[1:37:44] to that that's the Deep calling out to
[1:37:47] the Deep you say no that's emotion
[1:37:49] brother Brian I'm saying when I was
[1:37:50] running around and around and around
[1:37:51] that tree he said that was the Deep
[1:37:53] calling unto the deep I believe there's
[1:37:56] a deep on the inside of a people today
[1:37:58] that sees a Vindicated word and it tells
[1:38:01] them you're going to overcome you're
[1:38:02] gonna make it you're gonna Rapture and
[1:38:04] something swells up inside of them it
[1:38:07] hits that thousand Octane and off they
[1:38:09] go they can't stand still they're not a
[1:38:12] chicken it's indicated that's me that's
[1:38:15] me that's who I am that call my name
[1:38:20] hallelujah it's a Vindication of who you
[1:38:24] are it's the Vindicated word hallelujah
[1:38:27] and it's vindicating that it's the last
[1:38:29] day so you are the last day bride
[1:38:32] Hallelujah
[1:38:34] you can all stand to your feet with us
[1:38:44] Church the Miracles are important
[1:38:48] the victories the signs they're
[1:38:50] important
[1:38:51] to change lives
[1:38:53] they're important
[1:38:54] because without them none of what we
[1:38:56] claim is the truth
[1:38:59] none
[1:39:00] well we don't believe in signs and none
[1:39:03] of what you claim to believe is true
[1:39:05] if those things aren't there
[1:39:07] because without that
[1:39:10] there's no life
[1:39:12] anyone can claim a message
[1:39:14] anyone can came to claim to be bride and
[1:39:16] they do
[1:39:19] but there's going to be one Vindicated
[1:39:21] there's going to be one that he comes
[1:39:23] down and moves in their midst one that
[1:39:25] does the works that he said she would do
[1:39:29] brother Brown says now the scripture
[1:39:30] says that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:39:31] yesterday today and forever
[1:39:33] he did not claim to be a Healer he said
[1:39:35] it's not me that doeth the works it's my
[1:39:36] father that dwelleth in me he doeth the
[1:39:38] works he did not claim to be a great
[1:39:40] person but what he did claim to be he
[1:39:43] was well I liked that that's a powerful
[1:39:45] statement what he did claim to be he was
[1:39:49] Let each one of us take that for
[1:39:51] ourselves don't claim to be something
[1:39:52] you're not
[1:39:53] be honest be real
[1:39:55] be what you claim to be
[1:39:59] he that he was that he claimed to be and
[1:40:02] God will vindicate every man that speaks
[1:40:04] the truth God will prove it to be so man
[1:40:06] can say anything that doesn't make it so
[1:40:08] but when God speaks that makes it so and
[1:40:11] he said he did just as the father showed
[1:40:13] him and the scripture said Jesus Christ
[1:40:15] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:40:16] Hebrews 13 8 then Jesus Christ if he's
[1:40:19] the same today as he was yesterday he
[1:40:22] still does the same works today that he
[1:40:23] did yesterday if he doesn't
[1:40:26] if he isn't if he doesn't he isn't Jesus
[1:40:29] Christ and his claims are not
[1:40:33] so
[1:40:36] so think about
[1:40:37] when you're saying that we don't have
[1:40:39] that
[1:40:40] and he don't do that
[1:40:42] brother Branham says then he's not even
[1:40:45] Jesus Christ
[1:40:48] his claims
[1:40:50] are not so
[1:40:53] but tonight
[1:40:54] I've seen Vindication after Vindication
[1:40:57] after Vindication after Vindication
[1:40:59] after Vindication so I may be standing
[1:41:02] here at the Red Sea
[1:41:03] but I've just seen him call plagues I've
[1:41:06] just seen him save Souls I've just seen
[1:41:08] him heal I've just seen him deliver oh
[1:41:10] I'm standing at the worst thing the
[1:41:12] doctor could have ever told me that I'm
[1:41:14] about to speak a pathway right through
[1:41:16] it there's no hope for my family I'm
[1:41:18] about to speak a pathway right through
[1:41:19] it mine will never be restored I'm going
[1:41:21] to speak a pathway right through it how
[1:41:23] can you say it with confidence because
[1:41:24] he has over Vindicated this message he
[1:41:29] has Vindicated a Time After Time After
[1:41:31] Time and listen to me he Vindicated the
[1:41:33] Old Testament prophets he Vindicated
[1:41:35] Jesus Christ he Vindicated William
[1:41:37] Branham and the time is now that he's
[1:41:39] going to vindicate the Bride of Jesus
[1:41:42] Christ she is who she says she is and
[1:41:44] one of these mornings when we go it's
[1:41:46] going to be the greatest indication we
[1:41:49] were telling you the truth we are what
[1:41:51] we say we are and he will vindicate it
[1:41:55] one of these ones I can't wait I love
[1:41:57] these vindications but one of these
[1:41:59] mornings total Vindication total Victory
[1:42:02] Justified we are who we say we are the
[1:42:07] Vindicated word
[1:42:09] he'll vindicate it to you tonight Church
[1:42:12] in your need in your situation
[1:42:14] he's here to vindicate it to you
[1:42:17] can you bow your heads with me
[1:42:19] father
[1:42:21] Lord I speak these words to even like
[1:42:23] Tabernacle
[1:42:25] Lord not to condemn anyone or anybody
[1:42:27] who doesn't
[1:42:28] see it exactly this way
[1:42:32] Lord because
[1:42:34] you're going to get the attention of
[1:42:35] your people
[1:42:36] maybe some at one time and some at
[1:42:38] another
[1:42:40] but Lord I believe with all my heart as
[1:42:42] I read the message in the scriptures
[1:42:45] that there must be life there and
[1:42:47] evidence of a living God to vindicate
[1:42:49] that you're in our midst
[1:42:51] because where you are
[1:42:53] your works are present
[1:42:55] where you are your works are manifested
[1:42:58] where you are demons are cast out where
[1:43:01] you are there's overcoming lives where
[1:43:03] you are there's Victory where you are
[1:43:06] the shout of the king is in the camp and
[1:43:08] the prophet of God said and today the
[1:43:10] king is here in many bodies
[1:43:13] don't let us operate as that King
[1:43:15] let us all pray there's one that's bone
[1:43:17] of your bone flesh of your flesh
[1:43:19] Lord I didn't get to it tonight but your
[1:43:21] Prophet says over and over again that we
[1:43:24] are here to vindicate the word
[1:43:27] that our life will vindicate that what
[1:43:31] you said was the truth that you're alive
[1:43:33] that you are the same if who is going to
[1:43:36] show the world that you're the same
[1:43:37] yesterday today and forever if we don't
[1:43:38] Lord
[1:43:39] Lord if we're not operating in that
[1:43:41] fullness help us tonight father if we're
[1:43:44] not there if we don't see it open our
[1:43:46] eyes Lord Lord you've done so much that
[1:43:49] if you never do another thing oh we
[1:43:51] couldn't complain
[1:43:53] but I'm asking you tonight Lord
[1:43:54] vindicate yourself once more move once
[1:43:57] again because I know your heart she's
[1:44:00] the one that's going to bring forth the
[1:44:02] promised son and you're not going to let
[1:44:03] us miss it we thank you for it Lord we
