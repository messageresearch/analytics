that's something special to us let's just go to him in prayer heavenly father lord we invite you into the service tonight lord we can be seen by one another lord and it would be good and we could hug each other's neck and we could have words of encouragement lord but if you were to come into this service father it would make the difference lord and i was pondering and thinking that you don't look at a calendar and you don't put more into a sunday morning service or wednesday night lord to you they're both equal but when the people come expecting lord and there's something that's on their heart lord that's when you come behind it and back it up lord and i just pray that you would just come and be dynamic tonight lord many times we've seen you move in services lord and and you didn't look at a time and you didn't look at the place the building lord you looked at what was on your on the heart of your people lord and you came and you matched that expectation lord and we just pray that you'll be with the minister that steps behind this pulpit the true gift lord is when they can get out of the way father and they can submit themselves to what you have and they can just be a vessel that you can speak to your people there's so many people here lord with needs on their heart father and even us giving a testimony from my own family lord and how you moved on our behalf and you were with us every step of the way lord we still have these prayer requests lord for sister ruth and brother ross and brother ron and different ones lord that have gone over this pulpit lord and we know

may the church of the living god be edified tonight lord those here locally those who are streaming in those who'll watch the archives later god may they be blessed by the word that's being preached in this hour lord so we just commit this time to you now father in jesus name amen if you have your bibles tonight we're going to look in revelations 3 we'll look here in verse 14. it's great to have all our cruisers home good to have the church packed out tonight on a wednesday night with so many going to brother ron's meetings i'm going to play the politician we love you and we're glad you're here tonight but that's not really politician we do love you and we're glad you're here tonight you know one thing i get from watching brother ron he loves his people and you know and we're all built different but in our own way in our own we we love each and every one of you you're all special to us uh i couldn't imagine being in another place at another church fellowship and worshiping with another group of people so guys you're stuck so while we're stuck let's just enjoy it amen let's look here in the word tonight i want to speak to you on something we'll we'll read the scripture and then i'll give my title but verse 14 and unto the church or to the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that thou are cold or hot so then because they are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou saith i am rich i'm increased with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked notice the laodicean attitude toward the word of god and then it says now i counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment and that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thou eyes with i said that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and i will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and i am set down with my father and his throne verse 22 he that hath an ear let them hear what the spirit saith unto the churches god bless you you can have your seats tonight we're not going to try to hold you too very long tonight but just to kind of give you an update we were in arizona this past weekend at the tucson tabernacle had two services there we had a just a tremendous time with the believers there and they really uh just enjoyed the word and we had a little prayer line sunday evening after service and i got a text a little earlier today from brother aaron guerra he said my daughter wanted to let you know that that spirit of oppression that you prayed for left her and she's delivered and they're just rejoicing there with that so we thank you for that because we can't go on our own with your prayers it's uh we as a family a church family when i go i represent each and every one of you here and so we're just honored that god would so see fit to use us in that capacity so we had a great time but it follows our lot tonight to speak to you and we're just looking forward to what the lord has in store for us and let me get my timer started here but i want to speak to you tonight on listen to the voice notice i didn't say listen to a voice but listen to d voice so we know that there's many voices in the land today but we want to make sure that we're listening to the voice the bible will tell us here in john 10 and verse 27 my sheep hear my voice okay come on sheep this is going to be class participation tonight my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me now this word here means the same word that you find here in john and here in revelations 3 22 it means to attend to to consider what is or has been said to perceive the sense of what is being said or to understand so it's one thing to hear the audible voice but it's another thing to understand to consider to attend to and we understand that sheep may hear a lot of voices you ever been around sheep all they do is sheep music have a sheep act i don't know i've not been around them but but they hear all these voices but they only hear the voice of the shepherd see they only attend to the voice of their shepherd they only perceive what is being said when the shepherd speaks to them see the sheep they may hear a lot of voices but that's the only voice that really matters to them see their safety does not rely in knowing all the other voices their safety lies and knowing that all the other voices is not the voice of the shepherd come on sheep i'm talking to you tonight i'm preaching to you tonight and you're sheep tonight and there's all kind of voices in the land and your safety does not depend on all these other voices your safety tonight depends on that you know that all these other voices is not the voice of the shepherd because the shepherd is here to guide you the shepherd is the voice of truth the shepherd is the voice of protection the shepherd is the voice of safety the shepherd is the voice of life and my sheep hear my voice they attend to they understand they perceive what the spirit what the voice is relating to notice now john 10 27 my sheep hear my voice and i love this next part put this up there if you don't mind and i know them come on sheep you know it's one thing for you to claim i know god i hear his voice but it's another thing when that god the great almighty the creator heavens earth when he knows you tonight oh you can hear his voice but it's one thing for you to hear his voice it's another thing for him to know you in that word no there means to have knowledge of he has knowledge of you he's acquainted with you i sell glory to god tonight what a people we are to be known by the shepherd to know them no matter where we are whatever we're in the struggles of life he gave a word to us i'll not lose one of mine i'll leave the 99 and i'll guard for that one long sheep because that sheep i'm acquainted with that sheep i know that sheep and though that sheep may be lost though that sheep may not find its way back for a long time he said i'll not lose one i'll not lose one because my sheep will hear my voice oh don't you worry about your loved one tonight if they're sheep tonight you got a promise i'll lay the promise before almighty god say god i claim it tonight i'm your sheep i'm the sheep of the pastor you're the sheep gay lord i'm trusting that you to keep your word tonight now notice we find in matthew 7 and 22 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name watch all these goats start jumping up have we not prophesied in thy name have we not cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you i never had knowledge brother aaron of you i never was acquainted with you because they were never sheep because my sheep hear my voice and i know them i'm not speaking to the matthew matthew 7 22 23 group tonight i'm speaking to true sheep i'm speaking to those who have ears to hear what their spirit is saying to the church now we find here in the message the ephesian church age brother branham would say that he said it may be that millions will hear these words let me back up he that hath an ear let them hear what the spirit saith unto the churches it may be that millions will hear these words or read them but how many will pay heed to them that we do not know but we but listen what he says now but he who will lend his ear and want to know the words of truth will find the spirit of god enlightening him oh my why are you here tonight because there's a deep calling because there's something inside of you wanting to know the truth there's something pulsating within you didn't put it there man didn't put it there your favorite preacher didn't put it there the prophet that god didn't put it there but god almighty put it there before the foundation of the world and when you hear the word come forth what is it it begins to draw on that seed on the inside of you and it draws you to god and the spirit of god begins to enlighten you it begins to revelate you and you become stimulated by revelation i believe the word today can still stimulate people it can stimulate the young it can stimulate the old he can stimulate the middle age i believe the word of god is still in effect today i believe we got life-changing power in this message if we'll just recognize it didn't come from a seventh grade kentucky it came from almighty god god almighty dropped down in this hour in this age and this dispensation and he broke the seals off the book and he revealed it to a special class of people but if you can listen to the voice you will hear not joe adams tonight you're going to hear the voice of god speaking to you notice what he says now if your ear is open to the word the spirit of god will make the word real to you if your is open not shut off not close to it but if your ear is open to the word the spirit of god will make the word real to you now that is the work of the spirit he goes i can teach you the truth but if you don't open your ear to it and your heart to receive it you won't get the revelation so some of us sometimes we walk into church and we shut down on the minister because we got a bad day right like brother branham talked about sarah she wasn't in any form to receive the visitation that happens that's just humanity but don't let that be every service i mean come on let's come with an appetite to receive let's come on ears that can hear what the spirit is saying to the church now the prophet of god will tell us how tragic it is this is the ephesian church age how tragic it is that the first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to man but thank god in the last stage there will be a group rise up the true bride of the last day she will listen to the spirit in that day of gross darkness the light will return by their pure word and will return to the power of pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus now here we're talking about the ephesian age the first message of being paul paul being the one who founded the church who established the church in just a few short years 30 years at the establishment of the church the people begin to get away from that voice that anointed voice that anointed messenger that anointed servant of god and they begin to listen to the voice of man and the prophet of god will say how tragic it is that that church age refused to hear the voice of god and they went off with the voice of man let me tell you laodicea let me tell you a church of the living gods like don't you be heed to all these other voices but give credence to one voice and that's the voice of our beloved notice what he says now the ephesian age means aimed at but relax the high aspirations of this age that had begun with the fullness of the spirit the depth of god whereby they were aiming at the high calling of god and began to give way to less watchful attitude let's just be an opener to us like don't you get lacks stay home on wednesday night just because you don't this doesn't work out you don't forgot your peanut butter at home or walmart or wherever it is any kind of excuse you can put there i've seen a man stand behind the pulpit service after service after service for two solid years with stage four lymphoma cancer and i'm telling you we're without excuse tonight oh you play games tonight you can play games but one day there's going to be a calling and those are going to stand before the judgment seat of god and you either make your calling sure now or you'll be refused on that day so we find here notice they begin to have a less ardent following of jesus christ began to manifest itself as an omen that in the future ages the physical vehicle called the church would sink to the awfulness of the death of satan it had become relaxed and was drifting already the age was backsliding it left its first love a mere 30 years we're 59 years since 65. and if this church age had already drifted away from its voice what about this age that's why it's so imperative and so paramount that we hear the voice of god and not just hear it to say well i listen to a tape today but i mean hear it i mean pour yourself into it i mean become the word the prophet of god said you become the word as you receive the word and how do you receive the word by hearing the word by attending to the word by allowing that word to bring correction to bring encouragement to straighten your life bout it's no longer a man's idea or the denominational idea or the traditional idea passed down from generation to generation but you buck all that and you hear the voice of the lord notice now but he said in the last days in the in the age of gross darkness god has already decreed that there will be a true bride rise up oh that's when you can shout tonight there's gonna be a true bride rise up she ain't gonna fall like that first bride fell but she's gonna stay true to the word cause why cause she will hear only what the spirit is saying she will hear the voice of god in this age i say what a prize what a prize i'm talking about you tonight what a bride i no longer call you church but i call your bride tonight let me tell you that wasn't william branham that was almighty god showing a separation why because you didn't give over to the voice of the nomination you refused that voice and you believe you went with the voice of god and he separated you and he gave you a new distinction tonight and he calls you the bride of jesus christ i said oh what a bride tonight what are people tonight you've been called by almighty god this bride she's not following the voices of man she's not looking after the voices of psychology and ideologies and dogmas and traditions that's been passed down from one generation to the next generation she's following the voice of her beloved john 5 and verse 19. and then answered jesus and he said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things so ever he doeth these also do with the son likewise the son didn't do anything separate from the father and brother brother man will tell us in an exposition of the seven church ages he says now notice the harmony of the father and the son the harmony they were in mutual agreement jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father and he says now this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it all right she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death the word is in the bride as it was in mary the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord notice where the word is the word is in the brine what is the word the word is christ christ is the anointing that means that the authority is in the bride tonight the power to manifest the word is in the bride tonight the miraculous is in the bride tonight the supernatural is in the bride tonight healing is in the bride tonight deliverance is in the bride tonight whatever you have need of it lays in the bride tonight if you'll just recognize who you are and i'm here to tell you there's a voice speaking to you tonight he said those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise not even their favorite preacher they have thus saith the lord or they keep still notice now revelations 2 and verse 11 he that hath an ear let them hear what the spirit saith unto the churches every single age has the same admonition to the people of every age you go through revelations 2 and you go all the way through revelations 3 and you find at the end of every age to he that hath an ear because there's going to be a people out of every age that hears what the spirit's saying there's going to be somebody who's going to hear the voice of god and not just hear it but line up to it he says but it's absolutely impossible for all men to hear what the spirit says to the other to to the different ages let's go to first corinthians 2 and verse 6. now this is in the mess of the ephesian churches or the smyrna in church age he says now howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that came to not but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew not those great men they didn't know these things for had they known them they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written eye has not seen nor ear her neither have and enter into the hearts of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him come on bry you that love him tonight but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god the only way that we can know the spiritual things is because the spirit of god is in us and now verse 12 now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teaches but which the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet himself is just of no man for who has known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ now let's look over here in matthew 13 and verse 13. i'm building my foundation if that's all right this evening i got a little bit more time we're good therefore speak out unto them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not so it's more than just having eyes to see and ears to hear because hearing they hear not neither neither do they understand and in them is filled the prophecy of isaias which saith by hearing you shall hear and you shall not understand and see you shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is wax gross their ears are dull of hearing their eyes they have clothes lest at any time they should see what their ear or their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand what the heart or with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them but blessed are your ears and your eyes for they see in your ears for they hear see not everybody can receive this revelation tonight but he says blessed are your eyes because your eyes can see see beyond the veil you're looking beyond the man and you're looking at the spirit which is anointing that man to preach the word and he says blessed are your ears to hear because you're not hearing the audible voice of joe adams tonight or tim pruitt or aaron oaks me or your favorite preacher you are hearing the voice of god and i say blessed be you tonight brother jesus christ you have been anointed for this hour you are being predestinated for this moment that should make you rejoice tonight he said it is most evident from these scriptures that no man of himself can hear god that ability has to be given him to god or of god excuse me that ability has to be given him of god that's why we would find in matthew 16 jesus speaking to simon he says simon barjona for flesh and blood and not reveal these things to you these things are not revealed just by doing a casual study just because you got the table on your computer or on your phone or on your tablet or wherever it is yeah it's revealed by god because there's somebody's going to hear the voice in this hour now listen what he says here in the summer in church he's look i may get a little bit pentecostal here in a minute so y'all can get with me you can like brother i ain't going to say it i'm just going to keep on preaching this ain't my church but it says putting these verses together we can see that there is only one group of people come on get with me tonight one group of people and that a very special group of people who are able to hear what the spirit is saying in each age it is one special group that receives a revelation of that age i say oh blessed be the name of the lord tonight you're not in the denomination you're not doing the badness you're no longer in the catholic system you're not there in the met in the methodist or whatever maybe no you're a special group of people who have been anointed in this hour to hear what the fear the spirit is saying to this age he said that group is of god because the the other group cannot hear see he said that group is of god because the group that cannot hear is not of god they are the ones who have the spirit of god they are the ones who are born of god they are baptized into the body of the lord jesus christ by his spirit they are baptized with the holy ghost so when you get up in the morning and you don't feel like you're a believer you don't feel like you're a christian you don't feel like you got the holy ghost just come back to what the word just said about you you're a special group of people because why because your ears have been anointed to hear this word listen what he says in the exposition of the church age the church is made up good and bad the church is made up of good and bad two vines make up the church they are like the weed and the tares growing side by side but one is true the other is false now god will speak to each one and he will talk about each one he will call them church but only the elect will really know which is a true spirit that's why some people can sit here and you talk about cain and abel and they always identify with cain but the true spirit's gonna identify with abel judas and jesus that false spirits are always gonna identify with the judas but that true spirit's gonna identify with this word with christ with jesus and we look here in revelation of jesus christ paragraph 96 the book of revelation brother tim brought this out the other day and yeah i took it and i'll put it right here because it's just pertinent he says now the book of revelation has more symbols in it than all the rest of the books in the bible it has more symbols because it is the book of prophecy and if i recall correctly your pastor said that is your book come on church don't make me do all the preaching tonight that is your book it's a book of prophecy it's revealing to an endtime people exactly what's going to come on this earth and what's going to foreshadow you as a body you're not being left here but god's already predestinated your body changed he's already predestinated that moment well you'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye get your eyes off the chaos around you and look what the word said you're a special group of people notice now the book of revelation has more symbols in it than all the rest of the books in the bible it has more symbols because of the book of prophecy it's a prophetic book therefore it has to be understood by a prophetic class this book is not meant for everybody see there's nobody can understand it harley this book is made for a certain class of people oh my my my my you are that special class all the devils told you they ain't gonna mount too much the devil told you you're never gonna get it you never had it to begin with you're some low down scandal but the word here we find is to a special class of people a special group of believers oh church let me just take that shouting grounds tonight to recognize who you are you're not just some castaway you're not here by accident tonight but god called you as a special group not everybody can be a part of that special group not everybody is a part of that prophetic class but you are you are that bride that's been ordained not to fall like the first teeth you are that group that's been predestinated by almighty god to rise above it all you are that elect true church that can and does hear what the spirit of god is saying you are that prophetic class oh hallelujah you are the one that spoke about in the end time there's going to be an overcomer and without grant to sit with me in my throne as i have overcame and sat down with my father in his own i'm talking to an overcoming group tonight a special group tonight hell don't have enough to stop this overcoming group tonight because you're a very prophetic class if satan could stop that he would have already stopped you but he can't stop what god's promised oh you're going to overcome this age of complete darkness you're going to overcome an age of complete apostasy you're going to overcome when sin has reached this zenith you're going to overcome in satan's eating because you have been anointed to listen to the voice christ the mystery of god revealed he told eve don't do this and don't do that and you can do this and you can do that and you young people like yeah sounds like my mama don't do this don't do that you can do this but you can't do that but satan says oh but you know you know you got some friends like that don't you they make real friends and brother brown said she turned around and she listened to him now she knew what to do because she heard the voice because adam was lip to ear with almighty god but even the last day now this is your prophet talking about you special group prophetic class but the even the last day is not going to do it because she's predestinated not to do it yes sir god is going to do it he knows he'll have a church that will be without spot or wrinkle she is going to stand there in the splendor of him his word made manifest oh church of the living god tonight you can't fall oh my i know some of you worried about losing the holy ghost some of you worried about this and you're worried about that and worried about what happened a couple weeks ago at camp if you're going to lose it you can't fall oh he told you you have been predestinated not to fall quit worrying about falling put your promise put your faith in the promise of god you engross yourself in this word let me tell you in this word we'll change you tonight he said to every age we hear the same truth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sayeth to the churches but only listen only a spirit-filled man can hear the revelation for that age i've got a question for you have you heard yes that's a week yeah have you heard tonight have you heard what the spirit of god has said to you in this hour oh my only the spirit field can hear it only the spirit field can receive it he said none other can no sir they cannot because this is exactly what paul said in 1st corinthians 2 and verse 6 through 16. see now this ought to make you rejoice now that's your prophet now if we have ears that can hear what the spirit is saying in this age at this time not former ages not through previous messengers but in this hour in this sage through this anointed ministry that should make you shout tonight that should make you rejoice now whatever form of rejoicing you do that's upon you but you got to do more than just sit there like a bump on a pickle no it should make you rejoice that i have been predestinated to hear the greatest message ever hit the face of this earth god looked around all the masses and he chose you tonight he chose you to be able to rece not just hear it but to hear it to receive it to attend to it to understand what is being said to this generation to this special group of prophetic class of people oh my you know what this church we ran for a whole lot less than that that should make you run now i'm not trying to get you all motivated and excited but i'm here to tell you i told you i may get a little pentecostal because this excites me see we have the understanding we have received the revelation of god's word today our this message has become open see the opening of the word if you've received the opening the expounding of the word this is no longer a closed book it's become an open book and you see not only jesus christ through the scriptures but you see yourself in the word you can be there just like john said i saw all of heaven heard i john shout when john saw his name in the book that was shouting grass he had a reason to rejoice i'm talking to you john john typed out the bride and i'm talking to the bride of even like tabernacle tonight that should make you rejoice tonight knowing that you see yourself in the word you've received the opening of the word and we're not feeding on the words of a man but we are feeding on the unfailing word of the body word of the son of man tonight the word is being revealed to an endtime people the word is being revealed not just to let me put it like this the word is being revealed in an endtime people why do you believe the things you believe because the word is being revealed [Music] the spirit-filled man can hear that revelation you know when i first came to this church man i didn't understand nothing all this brother branham this and brother branham that and i didn't have a clue brother aaron but i knew something was calling me here i've been in baptist i've been in the pentecostal i've been in the methods i've been in the presbyterian but there was something different i didn't understand all the stuff i was hearing i was like man what is all this but i sat there long enough i gave my ear to it i had my share of some shakes and some valleys and some battles i had to work through some doubts and some this and some that to make sure that i believe that the message were true but you know what i didn't have to make myself believe god began to reveal those things and when that word becomes a revelation to you nothing can shake you off that foundation and that's what i'm telling tell you tonight when i heard the voice of the lord uh he wasn't the voice of tim pruitt though he's got a great ministry it wasn't that voice or wayne lawson or ron spencer or whoever you want to put there it wasn't their voice there was the voice of the lord that spoke to my heart i didn't know what i was looking at but i knew it was the voice i knew that god came down and he changed my life around and i'm here to tell you like that same god that worked out in me is the same god that planted you here tonight that's why you're here it's no longer mama's religion or daddy's religion or granddaddy's religion and mamaw's religion it's become your god because you have heard his voice there's a young people in this hour who is hearing the voice of the lord and their lives have been changed and they're manifesting the revealed word for this hour no people want to claim brother brahm didn't get emotional brother joe you just got to stop all that i'm so glad y'all asked that question i got a quote for you i actually got a few but i'm going to give you one he says now everywhere he says let us see god how many want to see him everywhere you look you can see god if you'll just look into his nature he said god above us god with us god in us god in his creation are above his creation and his creation and then god and his people god in his word and god and his people he says now and i will get he goes you know he goes and a while i got all filled up going to tell you something he goes in you'll know that i'm a real baptist so me and brother brandon on the same wavelength we're real baptists he says now while i was looking at that i got so full of the holy ghost until i set my gun against a tree and i run around a tree just as hard as i could kicking one foot up in the air whoa whoa well joe you need to calm down that's out of church order well you need to get into the word he said i was kicking one foot up in the air screaming to the top of my voice hollering hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah halloween just around and around and around until i almost fell down you know what he wasn't caught up in the spirit there was a little bit of humanity in that he almost fell down but he says i did i just threw my hands straight up and down and i began to holler glory glory glory glory hallelujah hallelujah just as hard as i could run i couldn't think of nothing else to say my heart was bubbling over the deep call until the deep i heard god out younger in the way that maybe that you you wouldn't hear him but to me he was in his universe calling back i'm the god of creation i made all things by my hand yes it's somebody would have come in those who they thought there was a maniac in the woods and you probably think there's one on this pulpit tonight around and around and around that tree i went just having a glorious time oh some of you critics need to just shake yourself a little bit and try to get into the spirit well i just don't want to have to work myself up well maybe you need to try for a minute you don't step behind this pulpit all alone in the first 15 minutes you work at it it's the same way in worship service that song leader don't come out here just all jacked up and he works at it he's giving it it's a it's a sacrifice a sacrifice of praise of sacrifice of worship oh but you get there and you get in there and you begin to worship and you've been to call on god and you can be put yeah you got to put a little humanity into it but all let me tell you that the spirit of god begins to fall then all of a sudden it takes that humanity apart it takes that that emotion apart and you begin to be caught up in the spirit and then you begin to preach things that you didn't know was there you god begins to pull you to somebody's knee what isn't i'm talking to you about i'm talking about allowing the spirit of god to move through you and to work through you and to create an atmosphere to where the almighty god can come down and speak to a people and the people can hear the voice of a living god not a voice of yesterday but a day god a now god a living voice a living god with living signs and living miracles the same god that met that young lady last weekend in arizona who had a spirit of oppression and now she's delivered because there was a voice came down notice because what i was in god's cathedral i could see him everywhere the sun the streaks coming through the woods the rainbow yarner the wolf hollering the elk hollering i could hear him in the winds oh my everywhere if a prophet of god could act that way in the woods because he could see god in his creation what about us who's been anointed elected to seek god in his word see clouds can overshadow the bright sun and you may miss god there but you won't miss him in his word oh if he can act like that there what about us here tonight to recognize you have been called to receive this word oh my it does something for me it does something for me listen let me get to this my mama i need a i need a two hour service now y'all good for that just kidding listen what he says here this is in smyrna church age i'm going to slow this down for a minute and teach us if i can go there he there let's look at this he that half an ear now how many you got ears not these two what you got here you're hearing what the spirit you know so slang saying you're picking up what i'm putting down that's what i'm talking about tonight he that happened here let him singular all right let him singular hear what the spirit saith to the churches notice here that jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person one person relative to the word for that age only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the church not people not the eighth messenger we don't need that one we don't need people picking up and finishing where the prophet got stopped we don't need that one one messenger to one church to one age all right he speaks for god by revelation to the churches both true and false the message is then broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who coming within range of the message that message is received i want you to clue in right here everybody clued in everybody clued in i need everybody right here all right listen that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way i'm trying to show you who you are that message is received individually only or only to a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by the way of the messenger those who hear are not getting their own private revelation nor is the group getting their collective revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from god so can i break that down for you just a few minutes because i told you i was going to teach this i want to just work on this principle here now notice those who here are not getting their own private revelation brother ben hears brother joseph hears and they get your own private little revelation or brother jackson brother aaron brother joe different ones we get a collective revelation and we put it together and see what it all says no he says that's not what's happening you're not getting your own private revelation you're not getting a collective revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from god so now if that's the case it begs to question why are there so many groups around or associated with this message why is there a thunders group why is there a perugia group why is there a two souls group and a return group and all these different groups and all these different revelations so did they hear the voice the same voice and they come away all these figureheads of these these groups did they hear the same voice and all of them come away with their own idea i'm going to say it like this if that is the case and we got one message to each age then if those groups and and and their ideas were so paramount why didn't the prophet of god found the thunder group why didn't he establish the perugia group why didn't he establish a two soul group in the return group why didn't he establish all that if we're receiving the same voice that the messenger received one message one messenger from almighty god dispersed out to a special group of people galatians 1 9 the prophet of god or the bible will tell us if any man preach any other gospel unto you wish that whatever have received let him be a curse this is paul paul is your first church haste messenger we're preaching the same thing paul preached we don't have a different idea we don't have a different doctrine we don't have a different dogma we're going to have a different creed we have nothing different than what paul preached and paul said if any man preached any other gospel unto you than what i've already preached let him be a curse and that word of curse there means without hope of being redeemed my mama that's a strong strong indictment but he said if you're a christian you will get back to what the spirit is teaching that is the word of this age every messenger to every age will preach that word every fresh and true revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age why is their revival even like tabernacle because it ain't about man's ideas it's not about uh kingdom building and all these other things it's about preaching the gospel it's about preaching the word that paul preached it's about preaching the word that iranians preached and all these different measures down through the ages it's about preaching that same word and that's what we're doing you're a special group of people to be privileged to hear what the spirit is saying in this hour in the spirit revelations 22 and verse 17 the spirit and the bride are saying something they're not saying two different things they're saying the same thing they're saying come they're saying that's the same word it's the same message they're not saying come to my group i'm not saying come to my church they're just saying come come come and receive of the waters of life come and taste and see what is being preached that is the realities of a living god notice each age had its own elect and that alleged group always heard the word and received it proving that they had the seed in them but there are so many voices in the land today some of you got your iphones handy that's a voice got your ipad handy that's a voice some of you got those special anointed monitors at home to pick up hulu and netflix and all these other things that's a voice you got your reels and you got all these other little things you got your all that social media stuff that's a voice and all these voices are vying for your attention all of them i like how brother ham he really thumped you young people a while back talking about all these rules y'all got all these little songs you would never turn to the country western station i mean country western country music station and your rock station and your rap station on your radio but you got all these reels and you just sing along happy-go-lucky thinking everything's hunky-dory it's a voice don't be gluten that you know all that garbage you should be ashamed you're exactly right but it's a voice and that voice is vying for your attention and so is the voice of our beloved he's vying for your attention he's vine he has come service after service he has nudged you he has moved upon you he has done everything he can to get you to respond to the word you'll notice the last warning in laodicea that he that had the ears to hear let them hear what the spirit is saying oh revelations 10 7. i'm gonna start wrapping this up i'm not closing i'm descending i flew out to arizona and i flew back and before i landed they told me where we're going to start our descend i said all right you know what they do when they descend they pull back the throttle and they slow down a little bit i can't promise you that we're going to start our descent but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared into his servants the prophets notice now verse 8 and the voice which i heard john is hearing a voice this ain't the voice of a man john is hearing a voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel we stand upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and i said unto him give me the little book and they said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and i ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples nations tongues and kings now the seventh angel has already sounded i hope none of you are looking for the eighth messenger he's already sounded he's not coming back to finish he's already preached his message and let me just tell you and we have already received it all right that voice behind him sound it wasn't that seventh angel when he began to sound it was a voice sounding out from him he received that revelation from god and he delivered that revelation to the elect now let me just show you can i show you something here that this message message was not the message of a prophet of william branham it wasn't his message i want to show you there's a quote here wow here it is looking to the unseen while you're standing on your feet you can stay seated brother mike if you want to get up i saw you about to get up you're welcome just kidding he says now while you're standing on your feet praising god how many wants you that raised your hands a while ago believes that god will hear my prayer for your salvation of your soul now come walking down here now as we sing and i will praise him i will praise him come on walk right down the aisles here now right down to receive jesus keep your hands up keep looking at to the unseen that little pulsation in your heart come moving right on down he's pulsating to you i'm the lord that raised up christ from the grave i'm the one that sent the holy ghost i'm the one that give the promise brother branham has nothing to do with this i have he surrendered his life to me i'm using his spirit i'm talking through his lips that's me i'm the lord i'm telling he didn't receive this message of himself and when he was going to open the seals when he was to go down there he said the angel the lord met him in the closet he would have made a horrible mistake what am i telling you church we didn't receive the message from a man but we have heard from the voice of god in this hour you have heard that supernatural voice and it declares to you tonight that you are a supernatural people and that voice is given instructions take the book eat the book become the book prophesy again where you say well the message was only for the prophet no it wasn't only for the prophet he said the anointed man now the anointed people the anointed man now the anointed people you got a responsibility you've got a responsibility to let this message live out through your life let it manifest let it be a living voice because you have heard the voice of god this bride has heard from her beloved she has taken that book she has eaten that book and she is prophesying she is prophesying that's why you can come and stand here and you can walk away delivered you can come and stand here and you can walk away healed you can stand here and you can have demons cast out of you because this bride has taken that book and she's become the word for this hour not because she heard the man's voice let me just say this if you only heard the voice of william branham you missed it if you only have heard that and that's all this message means to you i'm sorry to disappoint you at such a late hour but you have missed it look we didn't we are not falling in love with william branham we didn't fall in love with eleazar but we have fallen in love with isaac the one that he told us about the one that he showed us about the one that he made complaining to us he had told us about his goodness he told us about his mercy he's told us about us and we had fallen in love with what he told us about not the man that's taking us to our bridegroom but we fall in love with the bridegroom and it's our church we will appreciate the man we appreciate the ministry but i didn't fall in love with him i fell in love with my isaac but that's the problem with so many people they got their eyes on a man and they deify the man and when you deify the man you miss the voice of god you can't hear the voice because all you hear is the voice of a man that's why so many multitudes are pushing play because they refuse to hear the voice of the fivefold ministry the voice of god i have established pastors preachers teachers of endless and missionaries god established that that's his voice he didn't have to get to the seventh hour the seventh age and back up and change his program because the fiffo ministry can't straighten it out and now we gotta push play no you're hearing the wrong voice i'm not trying to be hurtful but i'm just trying to be plain we got to hear the voice of god revelation 3 and verse 20. we're slow pulling back one more time here behold i stand at the door and knock if any man here if any man will attend to my voice i will open the door and i will come into him and i will sup with him and he with me and to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and i am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let them hear let them attend let them perceive let them understand let them take knowledge of what the spirit saith unto the churches he's compelling everyone if you can hear tonight open the door if you can hear tonight open the door see god uses man man is god's vessel we'll may pick that up at another time but let me bring this down now start bringing us down to a close but before we do brother brown will say he is veiled with natural available for he could speak the word to the people now god has to veil himself as to as he promised in human flesh i'm looking at god tonight but he's filled in a lot of different forms some short some tall we ain't gonna go no further we good we ain't gonna pick on none of y'all me and aaron right here tonight but we're all different but yet he's veiled right here tonight think about it the voice almighty god has failed in your humanity but many times we get hung up brother hearing on this some of you get hung up on the veil you get hung up because you know what he ain't my favorite preacher and then because you come in with such an attitude he missed the voice well he's too loud he's too evangelistic you missed the voice or per adventure he's too boring puts me to sleep you missed a voice oh let's put it like this one because this is a good one you get closer to a preacher you begin to know that preacher ain't perfect how many of you out here are perfect i got a notetaker don't you even think about it this ain't time for mississippi to come out none of us are perfect but yet we put the ministry right up here in the perfect part of the pyramid the pps perfect preachers right there i just made that up and it fit perfect and then when that preacher you see his humanity oh you see things in his home you see things that he's doing or maybe his kids are doing maybe his wife is doing and all of a sudden he stands behind this sacred desk and he's preaching contrary to what's being done at home you don't receive because you're focused on the man you're focused on the veil and you miss the voice i know it's hard i know it's difficult but it's the truth you got to separate the vessel and you got to separate the veil from the voice and say god i come to hear from you tonight he may not be your favorite preacher he may have the worst delivery his voice may just make your blood crawl don't you amen that good lord we're traveling together but yet what do we come to the house of god for to hear the voice listen to the voice you know let's go on whoa let's go on let's bring this down home y'all ready to bring this home we're going to land this plane we'll pick this up at another time lord willing in the future yeah i'm missing a lot here two attorneys were in alaska they were doing a loss so this is a true story anybody ever heard of david gibbs christian law association it's okay to put your hand up i mean it's okay i'm not going to condemn you for listening to him he's a good man he was over in alaska in the lucian islands and he was doing him and another attorney were doing a lawsuit and they were getting ready to leave the lucian islands come back to anchorage alaska and then head home and he had a ticket in his pocket and this pastor came up to him said look i can save you a bunch of money he said well how's that he says i flew a small plane here and i fly a small plane while i'm here i can fly you back to anchorage and save that ticket you can use it another time and he's like he dwelled on it for a minute and he said against my better adjustment i agreed so they went out to the airport musicians want you to make your way back give me some preaching music if that's what y'all call it preaching chords or whatever something like that it's all good so they went out there and he took him by the plane and they looked at the plane he looked the plane over you know it's like any of us man that plane was shiny he's like boy so it's a shiny plane brother jackson he didn't it was all right pastor walk got in the front seat david gibbs got in the front seat the other attorney got in the back seat they started the plane up everything started fine motor ran good drove it out to the tax it out a little bit he said should we pray pastor says yeah you can we don't normally do it he said well we're going to this time so they prayed and they go out on the runway and the pilots started the plane started down the runway they lifted off very gently they started climbing up everything was just wonderful everything's just great man they're climbing this is great free trip home mainly cost me a dive this is great they started climbing about three or four minutes something happened pilate turned to david gibbs he says we're going into the clouds he goes i can't fly in the clouds the clouds make me pass out he said the clouds make you do what he said the clouds were there make me pass out and he said now it's been cloudy all day he said they started and when they got up into the clouds the pastor turned to look at him he began to mumble and his eyes rolled to the back of his head and he passed out he said he took him and he shook him wake up he said he passed smooth out cold attorney in the back said we're gonna die ain't we he said well it looks to be that way he said well what are we gonna do he goes i don't know i got on the radio and they begin to say hello hello hello hello they didn't have any radio etiquette you know i'd probably be doing a lot worse than that i don't know what i'd be doing but they're screaming hello hello hello somebody came back on the other end don't you guys know any radio etiquette he said no we don't know nothing only thing that we know is we don't know how to fly the plane we don't have a pilot he's passed out we don't know plain etiquette we don't know radio etiquette we don't know nothing only thing that we know is that we're in a bad fix he says you mean to tell me you in a plane and your pilot is passed out and you don't know how to fly he said that's correct he goes well i'll tell you what i'm going to do first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to start circling can we all going to play me some preaching chords or what i got to beg this up from what come on man y'all work with me we're team there you go give me some preaching course he said i'm going to start circling because if i get out of range and i'll lose you you'll not have me again so he began to circle he says i'll tell you what i'm going to do i'm going to get anchorage emergency on the line they're the ones that can help you they're the ones that'll get you home safe and he said just you know time went by just a little bit and all of a sudden anchorage came on the phone or came on the headset and he says now well the first thing i got to do is i got to find you i told you he'll leave the 99. he'll find that one sheep i don't care if you're fine blind in the clouds he'll find you he knows where you are tonight he says now here's the deal if you want me to get you home you got to promise me you'll listen to my voice [Music] he said now you can't see me but i can see you and if i'm gonna get you home you gotta promise me you're gonna listen to my voice come on young person some of y'all made a lot of promises only to break them but tonight you can promise i'm gonna hear your voice i'm gonna listen to your voice i'm gonna obey your voice he says now here's the thing [Music] he goes you're about four minutes from a mountain he goes in about four minutes you're gonna crash so you need to listen to my voice and some of you you're about four minutes from crashing you're four minutes from burning but if you can listen to that voice tonight if you can hear that voice tonight he says now you're four minutes from crashing into that mountain follow my voice the attorney didn't look at him brother aaron said you mean i gotta follow this man's voice is this even reasonable i mean come on really the voice of a man i gotta follow this i don't know what he looks like i don't know if he's ugly if he's fat skinny whatever you mean i really got to follow his voice see you got to understand church without that voice he had nothing without that voice he had nothing and i'm here to tell you tonight without that voice you have nothing if you're not hearing that voice tonight you have nothing you absolutely have nothing you're flying blind or you may be flying but you don't have a pilot and you don't know how to fly the plane yourself you're as good as a dead man anchorage emergency came on and said now i'll tell you what i'm going to do i'm going to i'm going to freeze all the traffic in there he goes now it's going to take me an hour and a half to get you back to anchorage and there's a lot of bad weather between anchorage and where you are tonight he says now you're in for a rough ride but he said now i want you to hear me i don't want you to look at what's going on on the outside see sometimes we get distracted we distracted what's going on in our family we'll get distracted about our loved ones some of you got kids out in the world you get distracted by those things and you start dwelling on those things and you look away from the voice but sometimes you need a service to pull you right back into it energize your faith he says now i don't want you to look at what's going on the outside i don't want you to pay attention to the storm just my voice see if you start watching the storm you're gonna die but i'll take you through brother christ i don't want you to be looking at all these other things that's going on in our society all this political chaos and all this rp lbgtqrp and everything else they want to labelize and put it out there don't pay attention all these storms don't pay attention to your finances to your health just listen to the voice tonight just pay attention he's the voice that has a responsibility to bring you through so they froze all the traffic and when they did these other other uh airplane pilots began to come on these freighters night freighters and 747 started talking to them guys were praying for you you're gonna make it it came to a service and they began to get encouraged you're gonna make it guys just listen to the voice that's the key just stay with the voice he says do you realize your head is full of voices he says we had in our head minds ah why did you get in that plane you big dummy you're never going to see your family again voices you're going to crash and burn you're never going to hold your wife again you're never going to hold your daughter again you're never going to tell them you love them voices voices all of them trying to be the controlling voice but god says i want you to be a living sacrifice i want you to lay yourself on the altar and let my voice be your voice die daily allow him to speak through you allow him to look away from the chaos around us and position you back to the word so they went through the worst of the weather but there was still more to come and the voice came back and says now i'm going to line you up i'm going to bring you right down the runway i just love how this type so much to what god is doing for his bride i'm gonna bring you just a catherine right down the runway here they were he was still storming and they couldn't see just yet about 200 feet they saw the lights he says now at the end of the runway there's a cross because i want you to remember this the cross is the way home god don't make mistakes church the cross is still the way home he goes now i don't want you to forget this the cross is the way home and he's bringing them down and they still can't see anything and yet he kept telling them stay with me stay with me you're not home yet stay with me see even when you can't see god he's saying stay with me even when you don't feel god he's saying stay with me even when you find it hard to trust him he's saying stay with me and just a couple hundred feet off the ground they saw the cross and the attorney or david gibbs he said i landed that plane he said in fact i landed it seven times he bounced all down that runway he said when finally when i brought that plane to a stop the pilot woke up but an anchorage emergency came on the other end he said thanks for listening to the voice he said thanks for listening to the voice because i watched him crash and burn all the time because they won't follow my voice they don't understand that i'm the one that can see them they can't see me they get all these voices in their head and they kill themselves they self-destruct and he said thanks for listening to the voice so they took david gibbs and the other
