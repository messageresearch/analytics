time brother [Music] want to see what it look like for being on the fight [Music] is real wow we that that we're all longing for as as we as we know that you know that man fell in the garden and from that time it's been a constant struggle but we know that we're promised that we'll see that again with with peace and and no pain and no heartache and no sorrow and that that's coming and but we're also thankful that we can say tonight that our hearts have already been turned back to Eden again that our souls have had the opportunity to be restored and brother brandham says heavens and earth have met God in man is reconciled a restored Eden has begun see all the curse is gone he said just like all the curse of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts you he says the desire of sin has done gone from your heart and when the Holy Spirit comes in you are restored he says and then when the earth is restored by the same thing there can be no more cursing no more storms no more winds no more typhoons he says you are reconciled man and God has met the new Earth will put on its Eden Beauty again the new Earth will spread forth after her baptism of fire he said the holy spirit of God will cleanse off every Speck of all the sin and everything all the devil will be bound and cast into the Lake of Fire consuming fire he says man and God Has Come Together bride and bridegroom heavens and earth has embraced each other God has come down to dwell among men his Tabernacle is with them he says there will be no more sin no more sorrow never will there be a tear drop of off a mother's cheek over her baby he says it won't be on that new ground no it's redeemed it belongs to him and for him and for his that was redeemed out of it see he says and look you are a part of that ground he says and when he redeemed you he redeemed the Earth with the same thing and you are together again oh how much plainer can it be see you have to be redeemed because you're part of of it and we're so thankful tonight that as we think about that back to Eden again that that he redeemed the Earth but he redeemed this part of the earth Sons and Daughters of God that that are being turned back to Eden once again and we want you to be there well on that great day when when we walk back into that that restored Earth again but in order for that to happen you have to be turned back to Eden again now in your heart and your soul and and we just pray I pray that each one has had that experience and if you have not this is a great weekend to make that happen there's an opportunity that lays before you the the to tonight even it don't we don't have to wait till tomorrow or Sunday There's an opportunity tonight as the word comes forth let it speak to your heart and recognize that I got to be turned back to Eden again I got to be turned away from the desires of this cursed earth right here and let the Holy Spirit come into my life and restore me so as we as we begin to turn in the order of the service we're going to have a a few songs and they're going to go in this order sister Natalie kuta is going to sing first then Landon Turner and then Zoe and Katie and Sarah Beth will sing third and what we'd like you to do is after the first person sings just the next person come on up and just carry it on right like that so right now we're going to have uh sister Natalie come up and bring her special for us [Music] t t no qu prophecy or fancy miracles for all to see just the words go down seven [Music] times so as non made his way into the Jordan River that day I can't help but think what was on his mind as he slowly reached the water's edge it brushes in over his head he looks to see if the coast has washed away or does he say I keep going down and getting back up but I see no change I feel no touch from you Lord where could you be this water's dirty and it's cold but there's healing in it so I'm told a miracle but I've yet to see but I'm staying here until you're through until I get a hold of you I'm going to keep believing but until then I'm going to go down [Music] again I know what I feel deep inside I've heard your voice a thousand times but now it seems so long ago oh and I'm still trying to believe that somehow you're listening but I would like a sign so I could [Music] know surely There's Hope left yet cuz you wouldn't just forget I'm fighting on my knees to get you so this is what I'm going to do I'll keep going down and getting back up till I see a change or feel a touch from you I know you're hearing me this place is lonely and it's cold but it's it's Holy Ground I know it's so a sacred place where you will meet with me so I'm staying here until you're through until I get a hold of you I'm going to keep believing but then I'm going to go down again I'll keep going down and getting back up till I see a change or feel a touch from you cuz I know you're hearing me this place is lonely and it's cold but it's Holy Ground I know it's so a secret place where you will meet with me so I'm staying here until you're through until I get a hold of you I'm going to keep believing but until then oh I'm going to stay here until you're through until I get a hold of you I'm going to keep believing but then I'm going to go down again going to go down [Music] again [Music] walk me up in a p and throw away the key take away the vision from these eyes that now now can see deprive me of the food I he and even by my hands and feet for as long as I know Jesus then I can still go free oh he said that I could Ste Go free what kind of man would reach down his hand and do this for me So Unworthy to live I was not F to kill but a man on the cross put my name in his will and said that I could still go free [Music] now I never could quite understand why a king would one leave his throne to Dawn the road of in Earth wory man and feel the pain of Flesh and Bor to later Char that Darkly PA that L to calary where the blood red stains they broke all my chains so

kill but but a man on the cross put my name in his will and said that I could still go free [Music] we live in a world that always questions if there could be a God in heaven every day we see thetics wonder how saying the Bible is outdated and that there's no way to explain it and the evidence is nowhere to be found but I see it is every time I look [Music] around I know that God is real and His glory is revealed in the heart of everyone who just believes he still saves and changes lives and there's no way to deny the difference that he made inside of me it's more than just emotion that I feel God is real and I can remember who I was and now I'm who I am and because there's a living God who came and made me new and I'll stay with him forever and everything we Face together is another story that will show the proof of the Gospel [Music] truth and I know that God is real and His glory is revealed in the heart of everyone who just believes he still saves and changes lives and there's no way to deny the difference that he made inside of me it's more than just emotion that I feel oh he holds me when I'm falling and he hears me when I'm calling and he listens and he answers every prayer it settled and I'm sure of the reality of his love I don't need to see his face and know he's there I know that God is real and is Glory is revealed in the heart of everyone who just believe he still saves and changes lives and there's no way to deny the difference that he made inside of me it's more than just emotion that I feel oh it's more than just emotion that I feel God is [Music] real God is [Music] [Applause] [Music] real [Music] well good evening friends so good to have you all here this evening it's been a beautiful evening we got a beautiful setting lots of beautiful decorations things to kind of make us think about a place that we want to prepare our hearts for that we want to get ready to to go to the world that we live in is a world full of chaos trouble it's not getting better it's getting worse as we go nothing that the governments can do of the world can turn this into an Eden nothing can fix the problems that our world is facing today but the thing about it that is so important is not fixing the world that we're living in at this moment but fixing the heart and preparing it for an Eden we look at the beautiful scenery around and can only just vaguely imagine what Eden must have been like the lion laid down with the lamb [Music] there was no evil no bad thoughts nothing wrong that could ever happen seem seemingly till sin iner I can only imagine there is Adam stood there in the garden and you know the lion was very much a lion and lamb very much a lamb but if there would have been something that would rise up within there you see Adam was the king in in the Eden his very presence would bring peace you look over at the LI lion and say down boy that's all he would go back to being [Music] gentle you know when you think about your own life there is a beast nature that every one of you were born with that Beast is a lion he'll tear he'll destroy he'll wreck families he'll ruin homes but if you can ever get the king the Lord Jesus's C on the throne of your [Music] heart every time the lion raises up the Beast he'll just say down boy come subject there'll be peace that's what we want for you young people we want peace to rain in your hearts I know the gospel works you know here I am coming up this next year and the boy preacher started out preaching the message when I was 15 years old I was your [Music] age I was you I am the I am proof that the message works it's not only worked for me it worked for 45 wonderful years of marriage it not only worked for me and my wife It produced four wonderful children children with their spouses and now they're my grandchildren the gospel works it brings a peace it brings a joy it brings what you're really searching for in life yeah we can talk about an Eden that will be one day where the wolf will be gentle and the lamb will be tame but right now you can have an Eden on the inside of you maybe chaos all around maybe chaos even in your family or in situations around the world that you're living in but I'll tell you he'll come down in your life and be the king no more will the beast in nature rise up and ruin and wreck and evil tempers and evil things but God be in control of your life down boy you bring it just subject you can have happy marriages and happy homes and wonderful children that's what this gospel produces you won't find this outside in the world it don't happen but I'll tell you when Jesus comes in he'll be the king of your life tonight we have had this time together just to stop and reflect and enjoy a moment enjoy some peace and fellowship that in this Shadow land it's just a it's just a mere kind of reflection of what it will be there Heaven won't be a boring place in fact of the matter is you won't stay there long we'll come back here to live on the earth but nevertheless nobody have to sneak in a game to play and you know this or that no it won't be an eternal church service where we're just all singing and and and praying and shouting and that would be a boring Place yeah but let me tell you what it'll be it'll be an eternity of Avent Adventures seeing things in a way that could could never be seen here in this carnal world this life is coming to the end we want you to make ready to be there to take part of the adventures that lie ahead great things are in your future God bless you tonight we're going to invite our brother Joshua Bennett to come brother Joshua comes from North Carolina we've learned to really love and appreciate him and Ministry I you know one of the songs that he [Music] sang here at evening light Tabernacle has had over 70,000 views and he's popular I don't know if he'll sing for you tonight but we know this that God is God and he'll make himself real to you God bless you brother Josh as you come will you welcome him tonight amen I won't be singing tonight amen we count it an honor and a privilege to be here and anytime we have the opportunity to speak to a portion of the Bride of Jesus Christ we count it a great honor and uh also recognize the great responsibility of of speaking to the purchase of the blood and as uh brother Aron made a few comments and then brother Tim was making comments um I thought well maybe I could just get up and say that's exactly what I was going to try to say and then we could uh just just let you enjoy the evening but I wonder if we could just bow our hearts together and have a word of prayer as we approach the word tonight Lord Jesus we ser certainly thank you for this time of fellowship and this Gathering we look out and see these these young faces and young people Lord and all the things that they could be doing and the desires that they could have and the places that they could go but but Lord you've brought them together in a place like this and in a time like this and Lord they've set aside their time to come and and to have this Fellowship not just with one another but Lord we want to have fellowship with you and so Lord we just ask that you would just come and as we look into your word and we open the the pages of the Bible God we're asking that the the author of the book would just come down now and Lord may you just move Among Us and speak to hearts and Lord you take the the the word and and just break it like the bread Lord I I think about how that one day Lord uh there was a multitude of people that were hungry but there was a little boy that had a lunch and he didn't have a whole lot but when it got in your hands you took it and multiplied what he had and fed the multitude that was there Lord I pray that you would do that this evening just take the little that we have and Lord may you just take it and feed every Hungry Heart and Lord just break the bread and Lord as you hand it down we'll just hand it out to them just the way that you've handed it to us Lord we commit ourselves in this service into your hands now and we ask it in Jesus name amen amen I'm going to read a couple scriptures out of the Book of Genesis and I want to read from Genesis the first chapter and uh just with the theme in mind tonight of restored Eden uh but I'd like to to approach it from this thought a res uh restored Fellowship leading to a restored eating so I believe that um as it's already been been said tonight that we're on our way back we're on our way back to to that Eden condition that that place of perfection that's what we're on our way to uh but we know that right now we're living in Satan's Eden and and we can very clearly see that all around us uh uh you know it's just um the world is not getting any better like brother Tim said it's not getting any and and and it's not going to get any better the world that we're currently living in the conditions are going to continue to get worse because this is Satan's Eden but there's going to be some that's going to overcome see there's going to be people even though that we're living in Satan's Eden we're not going to be a part of that because there's another kingdom that we're reflecting brother brandham said it this way in the church age book he said we are reflecting the kingdom of our rebirth and so that's why we live the way we live and we we dress the way we dress and we talk the way we talk because we are not of this world Amen we and we're reflecting the kingdom of our rebirth and so I just want you to have that in mind as we look at this tonight Genesis 1:24 and the Bible says and God said let the Earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and the creeping thing the Beast of the earth after his kind and it was so and God made the Beast of the earth after his kind and the cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the Earth after his kind and God saw that it was good and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them genes Genesis 2 and verse 7 and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground uh the made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life and also in the midst of the garden and the tree of know knowledge of Good and Evil in verse 15 of the same chapter and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou May freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die and so we see in this that God had created the Earth and and then within that creation he had planted a garden now this this Garden that God had had had created or there in the earth was a place where Adam would live a place where the tree of life would grow the place where where man would actually have fellowship with God because brother Brown would talk about how that God would come down in the cool of the evening and into the garden there and he would have Fellowship uh with with man and we can see that by the scripture that we read that Man was created to have dominion is that right we we see that very clearly uh in the scripture that man was made to have dominion over all the the the the creation the the fish and the cattle and the Beast of the earth man was made to rule or have dominion over the Earth and so brother Brandon would say uh say it this way in the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it cost to rid Sin from our lives that's quite a title he said said it this way he said when God made his first man he was a spirit man we see that in Genesis 1 and he was something on the order of God see or the Son of God he said the first man and he gave that man the jurisdiction to lead all the animal life he said just like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today he said see to go here and do this and if we were per in perfect submission to the Holy Spirit God would lead us by theol Holy Spirit just like Adam led the animals of that day and you see how perfectly it even ties with what brother Tim was saying that Adam when God created Adam he first created him a spirit man and he was in the image of God we know that God was a god of the whole universe but but God is a spirit is that right and so he is he's controlling the whole universe and Adam as a as a the Son of God in the garden of Eden he was a spirit man but God gave him dominion and I love how brother Brown would say he he led the animal kingdom uh as a as a spirit uh there in the Garden of Eden like the Holy Spirit leads uh the church today and and if we're in perfect submission to the Holy Spirit it'll bring peace just the same kind of peace that there was in the Garden of Eden it'll bring that kind of peace in our lives and so uh but then we see that there was no man to till the soul and then then we see uh God forming a Man Out of the Dust of the earth and then in the in the message Oneness brother Brown said now the first man and the first woman in the Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God so much that God could come down at any time he desired and talk lip to ear to Adam and Eve now that's the perfect Oneness now and I want you to think about this tonight that God would could come down at any time at any time into the Garden of Eden and have fellowship with with his children Amen in other words God didn't come down just at appointed times or or just you know he didn't just have times that he would come but God could come down at any time I want you to catch that tonight that God don't want to just have fellowship with you three times a week just while you're in church but God ought to be able to come down and visit you at any time and listen if you're uh if you've been born again and filled with the spirit of God Amen God ought to be able to come into your bedroom God ought to be able to visit you in the in the secret places and when when nobody knows what what you're doing but I tell you God knows what you're doing amen but God could even come down and fellowship with you just at any time that's the kind of fellowship and the Oneness that that that they had there in the Garden of Eden watch brother Ram said it was just perfect harmony with God until they were were so one with God and God and his family was one and another place he said and when God made man in the beginning to fellowship with him then this man was in perfect Fellowship in the Garden of Eden he was in perfect fellowship with God and how it must have been on that day when God would just come down in the cool of the evening and call at him and he and he would come up and they would worship God and they would fellowship and commune one with another you see because God longed for Fellowship amen there in the beginning God had a desire to have fellowship and and and and all these attributes was in God see and and and and God first created angels and and the angels was created for the purpose of worshiping him but yet even in that amen there was there was a desire that was in God that the Angels could not fulfill the Angels amen because God longed to have fellowship with a family see God didn't just want to uh create the angels and and the angels you know they they have their part and and they were created for the purpose to worship God and and actually brother Brandon would say before the Angels were were that God was not even God uh uh in the according to the definition of what uh uh of the word because God is an object of worship right amen but yet he was God potentially because all the potentials of everything God would ever be was already in him at that time and brother Brown said but he dwelt along there amen with his thoughts or his attributes amen but but yet all these desires was in God a desire to have a family and brother R said he wanted to have Fellowship Amen in the in in the adoption series he's talks about it how that God was he was first there uh known as Elohim the self-existing one see he was the all powerful uh uh all existence that ever was the self-existing one Elohim amen all sufficient off power Almighty self-existence see but in Genesis 2 when he made man he said I'm Jehovah and what did it mean I'm the all existing one who has created something off of myself to be a son see or an amateur little one of mine amen Oh Glory he said he gave a man Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateure God because God is Father God and he made a man to an amateur God so he is isn't self-existent anymore he exists now with his family amen God made a man to be dominant over all the Earth he had dominion and the Earth was man's Dominion is that the scripture then if that's his Dominion he was the god over the Earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak this and it would be so and there he is god Jehovah the one who existed amen but now exists with his family his little ones amen and so you you see that God longed to have a family God wanted children he wanted somebody that he could share his glory with that that someone someone that you know and you see this expressed even Jesus expressed this desire of Fellowship there in John 17 John 17 when he's praying now to the father he says father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am see that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou has loved me before the foundation of the world and brother Brown picks that up in things that are to be and he said Jesus only asked for one thing in his prayer to the father and you know what it was the one thing after all the sacrifice that he did here on Earth and the life that he lived and the path that he walked he asked for one thing that where I am they may be also SE see he asked for our fellowship amen that's the only thing that he asked the father in prayer was your companionship forever amen and if you want to read it it's John 17 the 24th verse and how much more than we should we desire him see I if he had that desire for us amen how much more should we desire him see if you're really born of the spirit of God that just means everything to you it ain't some Book of Rules amen you don't live by any laws and so forth amen you live by the grace of God by the spirit of God and I want to tell you this tonight as a young people this message ain't bunch of rules you might look at it and think well that's really hard and you know we can't go here and we can't do that and we can't do that listen friends this message is not a bunch of rules when you when you really come into that fellowship with God Amen it's not a a legalism amen It's A Love Affair amen a a and you want to please him because he amen because you have a revelation amen of what he's done for you see amen and I tell you this when you come into that love affair when that Rel relationship and fellowship with God Amen then you'll find out that that will do what legalism has always failed to do amen because you can never Force somebody to be a Christian or or or or or to live an overcoming life that don't come that way listen friend the only way that you're going to overcome in Satan's edting is you got to get the Overcomer in your in your heart amen he's got to do it in you is that right and so as we look at this we know that there in the Garden of Eden that was God's Masterpiece it was his Masterpiece family and brother BR we talk about it and how that he that as a great sculptor he he begin to build and he said he would start you know uh uh brother Brandon would teach us the correct uh you know uh evolution is is is not uh you know what they're teaching out here in the schools today but it was by creation see and God would start with the botney life and so forth and come up to a higher form of creation he brought it into the animals and but he but but but yet God was longing to create something that would reflect him see amen he wanted to create something that was in His image and in his likeness amen and and and man when he created man in the image and the likeness of God that was a reflection now of the Creator himself and brother Brandon would say that it was a masterpiece family and when or or or uh that was God's Masterpiece rather when he created man that was God's Masterpiece he said but yet even in that he said there was something that was was was missing there there was a there was a longing that was even uh in Adam see Adam was now going to reflect the very Heart Of God because when when when uh God looked at Adam he said it ain't good that he should be alone see he it's not good that he should be even though he's a he's in my image and created in my likeness and so forth but yet there's something that that that's missing in this picture it's not good that he should be alone amen but so what did God do he didn't take a separate uh uh handful of dust and create a a a helpmate for Adam but he actually according to the scripture caus a deep sleep upon Adam and he took out of his own side see and created from his own side a helpmate amen and and and and that was that was the fulfilling of the desire that was God was reflecting through his Creation The Very desire that he had because God longed to have a bride seek amen God longed to have somebody because out of all the animal kingdom that was brought before Adam there in in the Garden of Eden Adam gave them all their names but yet in all of that creation there was nothing that was found that could be a helpmate to Adam there there was nothing that Adam might have loved the animals and I'm no doubt he did he may have loved the horses or the or the the lion or whatever more and that could be a great thing that he could you know uh uh uh uh have dominion over there in the garden and he had Out full control and dominion over and he gave them all their names but yet all out of all of that there was nothing found there that could fulfill the desire that was in his heart to have companionship and and and True Fellowship amen because listen to have True Fellowship you got to have something in common to have True Fellowship amen listen Kings fellowship with Kings is that right amen uh uh uh lowly amen the the poers fellowship listen friends poor people fellowship with poor people amen you know why because they got something in common amen they know amen they know the struggles and they amen they understand one another why because they got something in common and listen and that's why if God was going to have fellowship with somebody it would have to be somebody that was just like him amen am and the only way that God could have that is that that person had to come from the same origin amen it would have to come from the same place amen by the same creation amen and so we see that this is all being reflected through uh uh uh the the Masterpiece family that God and brother said when God created uh finished his Masterpiece then he took it and he put it on display in the Garden of Eden and so that's when Satan slipped in see and brother Bram said he marred the Masterpiece you know what happened because brother Brown said when it was all finished and he put his family there in the garden he said they were fortified behind the word of God and I just want to tell you this this brother brother Brandon would say something and I think it's so powerful he said God gave them the very best thing that he could have ever given them for protection and that was the word of God and brother bam said you can't improve upon it he said it's perfect you can't you can't make improvements upon the word of God Amen because it's perfect and let me tell you God's word still today is the best fortification that you could ever stand behind amen and Satan couldn't even get to Eve as long as she stayed behind that word and but but what did she do she stopped long enough to listen to the LIE of Satan amen and she stepped out brother Bron would say it this way she stepped out from behind the walls of the fortification of the word amen the best thing that God could ever give you he has given to you amen and your fortification is the word of God and as long as you stay under that word behind that word and stay fortified by that word listen for it don't need improved upon amen we don't need to improve upon the word but I tell you what brother Brown said he said you can't improve it he said but God can make it more real to you amen how many want to say tonight Lord make your word more real to me amen by the revelation of the holy spirit amen let the spirit of God take the word of make it more real in my life amen amen that's what I desire because that's our fortification amen but Eve see she stepped out from behind that fortification Satan slips in the the Masterpiece is marred amen but brother B said but God would not leave it laying in that condition amen when when even there in the fall in the Garden of Eden when man fa there amen listen God determined right there he said I'll not leave it in this condition he said but immediately he begin to work to rebuild it again amen amen but see what was was it that broke that Fellowship what did Adam really lose what what did Adam really lose he didn't lose a piece of just a piece of ground only see amen what did what did Adam lose he lost inheritance he lost his his Divine Fellowship amen that's what Adam really lost Amen in the fall amen and what broke that Fellowship was Sin Sin broke the fellowship listen the prophet said since sin broke the fellowship man has been tossed about from every wind of Doctrine and he's still tossed about he's turned he was turned out of the Garden of Eden to shift for himself and then that great time see from that time he's still tossing about amen amen why because sin broke the fellowship and let me just say this tonight sin will still break the fellowship amen if you if you ever come into fellowship with God I tell you this when sin comes in the picture it'll still break the fellowship amen because God cannot fellowship with sin I'll prove it to you by the scripture 2 Corinthians 6 and4 Paul writes and says be ye not unequally yolked together now this is a great opportunity for me to to to to speak to you on this because a lot of you are are either searching now or you will be soon or amen and you're looking for somebody to share your life with to have companionship with to to to to to be a maid and and listen amen Paul is laying out a principle in the word of God don't be unequally yolked together a Believer should never under any circumstances marry an unbeliever amen can you agree with that amen why I'll tell you this you're going to have trouble down the road there's going to be a lot of problem that will not be an Eden that will not be an Eden marriage because you're trying to uh make light fellowship with Darkness brother uh uh Paul brother Paul said that it'll never work see he said for what Fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness what Comm what communion has light with Darkness see so the only way to restore the fellowship is to remove the sin if sin broke the fellowship the only way to get the fellowship back is we'd have to remove the sin is that right and watch cuz brother B would say this in God's power to transform I think this is a beautiful statement he says the first man was in in the image of God which is a spirit John 4 says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and God is a spirit and the first man that he created was a spirit man and he was in the image in the likeness of God and then he put his this man in flesh and man uh and man fell so then God came down and become in the image of man that he might redeem that Fallen man see that's the real gospel story to my opinion brother Bram that's what brother BR said that's the real gospel story to my opinion Man was created in the image of God but then that man was put in flesh he fell in that condition see so then God comes down in the image of man to redeem that Fallen man back to his original condition listen friends I want to just tell you young people this God has sent us a message in this evening time how many is thankful for the message of the hour and God has sent us this message and this message is a message of restoration amen and what is a message of restoration to do is to bring us back to our ought toe condition to what we was created to be in the beginning listen friends amen God never created us to be in a fallen condition condition to be ruled by sin and sin desire and amen to be to live a a defeated lives amen God did not create us Amen to be in that condition he created us Amen to to have dominion Amen to to to be Overcomers Amen to to have fellowship with him he created us to be his children Sons and Daughters of God to believe the word of God to live the word of God Amen to to live a Victorious Life amen and God has now sent a message in this last day to bring us back to our all to be condition some message of restoration and so that's the real gospel story the prophet of God said and watch because he would he would say in God's provided way or of of approach to Fellowship he said did you notice as soon as a man as soon as man falls and he's F he finds that he has fallen and he's a sinner by Nature he tries to make himself a way to approach God see He makes himself a religion well I I I don't want to do no harm or I just feel I'm just as good as any other man or I'll keep the Golden Rule see that wasn't God's program in order to restore Fellowship again God made a provision right there in the garden and if there would have been any other provision better God would have made it but God made the only provision the only basis of restoration Amen to that blessed eternal Fellowship that was through the blood of an innocent victim see and God made a way back to fellowship and that's the only basis that God ever had or or has now or ever will have back to a relationship and fellowship with God is through the shed blood of an innocent one and see brother B said that just makes me feel religious knowing that there is a way amen there is a way there is a God provided way listen friends I ought to make make us all feel religious tonight amen because we can all see amen that there's been a fall we can all see that the that the world is not in its ought to be condition we can all see that amen that that we're not in the Garden of Eden currently living on this Earth in a in an Eden condition we can all see that amen but what ought to really give us courage and and make us rejoice this evening is that God has made a way back amen we can all see that there was a separation but we to be thankful that God Amen has made a way back he's made a way to restore the fellowship amen there and brother Brown said there's been many substitutes tried Adam tried it we've tried to educate people to it we've tried all different forms but there's nothing that brings a man back into fellowship with his maker but the blood of his son Jesus Christ it's the only appro uh approach God has is the blood an innocent victim died for a guilty person SE that brought the Fellowship back to God and man again and then Adam covered by the blood could stand in the presence of God and worship he said oh I love that there's something about it when you speak of the blood the blood has life listen friends it's not uh the chemistry brother R would teach us in the token it's not that what is the what is the blood today the blood today to us is the holy spirit amen it's the life that was in that blood amen that's the the the overcoming power that's the way back to God Amen you can't get it by joining a church you can't get it by uh reciting the Apostles Creed you can't get it by putting your name on a book you you're not going to get it by memorizing scripture or memorizing come on listen amen there ain't but one thing there's only one way back amen and that's by a new birth amen that's by the true baptism of the Holy Ghost there's no substitute to it there's no other way there's no other way to have fellowship with God except by the spirit of God and by a rebirth amen by being regenerated amen you got to be born the second time the way you should have been born the first time amen God has made a way friends amen that we could be born amen again yes sir and that's the way back see brother B said see Adam couldn't meet the the requirements of redemption he couldn't do it because he himself needed Redemption is that right but brother Bram said that the law demanded a kinsman redeemer the law demanded it God's Own law demanded a kinsman redeemer Amen in other words God couldn't come down as as just the logos and and redeem you am because listen God because man fell in the flesh man didn't fall in the spirit he fell in the flesh and so God had to come down as brother Brown said in the form of man amen for the purpose of redemption Amen to to to redeem us back Amen to what was lost in the Garden of Eden amen he said the law demanded it but Grace amen Grace met its requirements in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and brother BR said love constrained him to do it amen amen love constrained him to do it amen the grace of God Amen the love of God constrained him to to make a way back amen for you and I amen that we could go back Amen to what was all that Adam lost there in the garden brother bam said in the message of Grace he said Grace is old Grace is as old as the world is Grace was first known to the human race at there in the beginning of the human race when when when it was first created in the Garden of Eden and on that dark morning when the little woman had stepped across a separating line and gone against God's Commandments and enticed her husband to do the same thing the law was broken the law must have a penalty or it isn't a law no more see the law was the day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die and remember the first judgment seat was upon the Earth it was there in the Garden of Eden and the last judgment seat will be upon the Earth at the end time at the white Throne he said but when Jehovah come down I could just imagine there wasn't even a star to shine it was so dark that the light the little light uh the uh the little garden there that was once uh so beautiful because sin had blotted out the light see watch what he said had taken the light from among them and that's what's to matter with the churches today that's what's a matter with people today sin has blotted out the light of the Living God Amen to show that Christ is still the same yesterday today and forever and that he still lives to save the uttermost and to heal the lowest and and every sick person amen why can't people see that because sin has blotted out the light of God and brother Brown said what a dark day that was how terrible it was that morning Darkness hanging there in the garden and I imagine that the fog of the black sackcloth was I imagine every leaf no even moved amen there was no wind stirring it was just darkness and terrible because sin had blotted it out and then there come Jehovah down like a roar of Thunder walking through the garden crying Adam Adam Where Art Thou and that's when Adam realized that he was naked and that he had sinned before God and he HD him self and tried to make himself a religion but it didn't work amen but what did God do he killed some sheep and he took the skins and show that something had to die to cover sin amen joining church will never cover sin no dried confession will ever cover sin it takes sorrow and repentance and the grace of God to cover sin amen amen see amen that's what it takes amen the blood of Jesus Christ the one that God killed on Calvary to cover sin and there in the Garden that morning when sin was so black Jehovah come in and there stood his couple standing there condemned there would be no more human race they had to D SE death it was death there amen death of the human race to give the world back to the wild beast and there there would be no more human race but in that darkness in that hour of darkness in that time when all hope was gone Grace come pouring through amen he said I'll give you a savior I'll give you a messiah amen oh so wonder how God would ever do it but it was God's Amazing Grace in the Garden of Eden that gave them a promise of a just one who would come through the woman the woman's seed and he shall bruise the Serpent's head the guilty one amen and his head shall bruise her heel to show that there would be Affliction in the church but he promised a Triumph amen what provided a savior Grace provided a savior amen I can just think about how brother Brandon would talk about uh there many times we would say maybe that brother Brandon would dramatize it out but I just heard him say the other day that while I was preaching I broke into a vision could you imagine brother I tell you amen sometimes we think maybe brother BR was just dramatizing something out but sometimes he was literally seeing a vision he was seeing what was happening and I can hear and say I broke into a vision brother BR would say I see Adam and Eve walking out of the garden he said I see Eve laying her head over on Adam's shoulders he said I can hear something he said it's teardrops dropping down to the leaves he said I can hear the sound he said they're crying now they're mortal now amen listen they was experiencing emotions that they had never experienced before amen they were experiencing sorrow and fear and and and all these things that they had never experienced before and here they are walking out of the garden and brother bam was said I see them walking out of the garden he said I can hear the the the the skin of the Lamb beating against Adam's legs amen but but then he said I hear a roar thundering through the garden amen listen Adam and Eve is walking out with no hope but all of a sudden the voice of God Thunders through the garden and he says wait a minute amen I'll Make A Way Back Hallelujah I'll make a way of Salvation amen I will point a seed amen I'm going to defeat the enemy I'm going to make a way back and brother Bron would say oh amen but I hear another sound amen and maybe I could just maybe dramatize a little bit tonight amen I can I can see that I can hear the prophets saying those things and I begin to to catch a vision of of Adam and Eve walking out of the garden there amen tears are falling off of their their faces now amen they're they're mortal now and all the emotions that's going on Amen but I hear another sound I I hear a baby crying in a Manger amen I hear a little baby amen crying in a manger and listen Amen brother man said there's your son amen Jehovah born on a over a manure pile amen there's your sign to your intellectuals and you're puffed up and you're proud and amen there's your sign amen God becoming a baby born in a manger amen what did he do that for for your Redemption and I want you young people to think about this this evening amen he could have come as a full grown man God could have stepped out the eternities amen down to the Earth and he could have done it as a man amen but he come as a baby and he and why did he do that but the Bible says that he didn't take on the the form of the Angels but he took on the the the the the Seed of Abraham amen he he become a man and he was born a child you know why that he might be a faithful and merciful high priest amen he come as a little baby and he grew up as a teenager amen and you know why because he wanted to know what you're going through he wanted to face the trials that you face could you imagine if the Savior we had amen was on what come to the Earth as a full grown man amen some of you could look and say but he never knew the problems I face he never under he can't understand what I'm going through amen but I don't want to tell you this tonight amen he knows and he understands because he was a child one time too he was a teenager one time too and he and he and he understands the very trials that you're going through and The Temptations of your life oh I hear another sound amen I hear a man amen I hear another man weeping in a garden amen I I can hear I can see I can catch a vision of a of another Son of God standing in another garden and tears is coming out of his eyes amen and his sweat is becoming his blood amen I I see another man it was the second man Adam the last man Adam amen and this time he's not standing in in the in the Garden of Eden he's standing in Satan's Eden amen and he's standing in another Garden The Garden of Gethsemane amen and the Bible says by one man's Disobedience amen speaking of the Disobedience of the man there in the garden of it that's what caused the whole fall amen but by one by by another man's obedience amen because there was another son of God there was a last man Adam and he stood in the garden amen and come to a complete and total surrender to the will of God Amen you don't you think that was easy amen listen friends it wasn't easy amen the spirit left him could you imagine he did this as a man he did it without the anointing he surrendered his life completely into the hands of God brother Brown said there he stood stood he said and and he said I I hear a crowd crying out crucify him I hear the people saying away with this man he said I can see a little woman step up and say what what for what cause what has he done what evil has he done what has he done but healed the sick and done good and and and went about doing good for what cause would you Cru but they cried out Amen brother BR said I can see them shove to the side and said you going to believe this woman or believe your priest amen uh and they would cry out the more crucify him crucify him he said when I can see him walking up a road he said I hear wood bumping over Cobblestone amen listen friends I hear I hear another sound tonight amen I can hear the sound of that cross as he drug it up the road I can see the spots on His Garment becoming bigger and bigger the the the stain of blood becoming bigger and until brother Brown said it was just one big bloody garment Amen on the Lord I can see the crown of thorns on his head amen I hear another sound tonight I hear the sound of a hammer hitting a nail amen and I hear that sound I'm reminded of this amen it was my sins that put him there amen and he carried my sin to the cross and the handwriting amen of the ordinances that was against me he nailed to the cross he become a curse amen he took my shame hallelujah amen he took strapes on his back so that I could be healed amen he took my shame amen and he nailed it to the cross of Calvary amen I can hear another sound I can hear amen the sound of my savior cry out it is finished Hallelujah sin's debt is paid Amen brother Brown tells a story there and on the wings of a snow white dub he talks about he saids said there was a a a little messenger pigeon you know he said back in the second world war and the American soldiers was pinned down and and he says how that they were pinned down there and they had no hopes of getting out and they were under great uh heavy fire the uh of the Germans and and he said that he said but but but they had a little messenger pigeon and and they begin to remember and that was the only hope they had so they put a message and and and and tied it on that pigeon and let him loose he took off because he's a home loving bird brother R said and he went flying by and the Germans saw him they begin to you know shoot at the pigeon he said and and and you know and they one hit him and another one and you know grazed him over here and he was bruised and he he was battered and he was and he said but but he come flying down crippled bruised battered he said but the message got through hallelujah amen the message got through amen and and and the prophet God said he fell into camp with a message he said that was a great Dove but old brother Isaiah 53 tells us of one that came down from home and all that was good and he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed sickness and Superstition and Devils had us pinned down there was no way out of it the church had gone wrong and went off into denominational things and the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the of pots and pans and the word of God had become of no effect but this little Dove came down Hallelujah and there's only one thing that could take place there had to be a redeemer amen but being wounded and broken and beaten and torn amen he but but he knowed his way back home and from calvary's Cross where they bruised him and mashed him and tore him like a bunch of wolves upon him he's made his flight amen from Calvary and he landed in Heaven's Door saying it is finished it's finished they're free Hallelujah sickness can be healed Sinners can be saved the captive can be set free and though he was bruised and wounded amen The Great Battle amen there when everything was against him even the poet Cried Out mid rendering rocks and darkening Skies My Savior bowed his head and died but opening the veil revealed the way to Heaven's Joy an endless day oh how many's glad the message got through amen I say the message got through amen a way has been made back brother Ram said I think of him he said when he had risen from the dead that morning and he had on his he had his own blood as a high priest and he went beyond the veils he went beyond the veils every spear see Satan in times P listen to this Satan in times past had blocked off Heaven he could he he man man could not contact with heaven but when Jesus took his blood the first Veil he rent was the veil of death the veil of the Grave the veil of the temple the veil of sickness the veil of fear every Veil that there was amen the unveiled God to man amen and he went above the heavens of heavens and was seated at the right hand of God and sat down as a finished work that's right amen and all above and there he opened up the channel that God used to come down through the corridors of heaven and talk with Mankind in the Garden of Eden and Satan by sin had blocked them off but what a great high priest with his anointing with the blood went through every Veil and ripped her open and cleared out the skies again that God and man could be father and son and could commune with one another oh what a marvelous thing think about this amen when Jesus died listen for he not only went to hell he went to hell and carried your sins there and he conquered hell amen I said Jesus Christ conquered hell I feel like I just want to stop and say this tonight amen everywhere that Jesus ever faced the enemy of of Hell or of Satan he conquered him he defeated Satan in heaven listen friend Satan was defeated in heaven this battle that we're fighting didn't start on the earth it started in heaven amen and and and Michael and his angels defeated and cast him out of Heaven is that right amen but not that's not where it ended friends amen not only did he defeat him in heaven he also defeated him on the earth Jesus come in a flesh body and lived as a man and brother BR said in the hour of his temptation when he was led away in the wilderness to be tempted he defeated Satan with the word of God Amen brother man said he didn't use no Supernatural Powers as a as a Son of God he defeated him with the word of God you know why he did that to prove to every one of you that you also can defeat Satan with the word of and the word of God will defeat Satan on any grounds anywhere at any time Hallelujah so he defeated him in heaven he defeated him on Earth amen not only that he defeated Satan in his own house Jesus went down to Hell and he defeated him there and he conquered hell in the grave and he rose for your justification but that ain't the end of the story brother Brown said amen the the the one of the most under preached scriptures was was his Ascension he said because then he ascended oh my and on his way up he broke through every Veil and he cleared every channel that sin had blocked that Satan had blocked he had blocked the channel that once that God had once fellowshipped amen with his Creation in the Garden of Eden those channels were clogged up by sin amen but when Jesus rose amen and ascended with his own blood he opened the channel back up glory to God Amen that you can pray Hallelujah and you don't have to pray to a pope you ain't got to pray to the Virgin Mary amen you ain't got to come come on Friends amen you can pray amen and God hears you when you pray you can come boldly to the throne of grace because you're coming through the shed blood of Calvary the channels have been open Fellowship is restored and brother B would say it this way God is back like he was in the Garden of Eden communing with our souls speaking to us again oh he said God poured himself into Christ amen this is in the message what is what what was the Holy Ghost given for listen to this catch this what was the Holy Ghost given for amen God poured himself into Christ amen Christ poured himself into the church and therefore he said at that day you will know that I am in the father amen and you are in me and I am in you at that day you'll know how many knows brother Brown said that day is this day amen and and he said you'll know and the whole thing is one Plan of Redemption coming down that God is coming back to live in and dwell in and commune with his people as he did at the beginning Hallelujah and now then as soon as he gets the church in speaking conditions he gets the church to the place that he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship and then there will be an Eden Hallelujah he'll take his church back to where it left him at the beginning and to an Eden again amen when are we going to go back to that Eden when he gets to church back to a on speaking terms when when the church comes back into Fellowship amen when God begins to flow through his church again by the power of the Holy Ghost amen when the church comes back into that condition then we can see we're on our way back to Eden again hallelujah oh my amen just back exactly back the church take the church where it left him back to Eden where it fell amen that's where it made its first start amen that's where it'll be taken right right back where every Clean Slate of redemption bringing them right straight back to that place again then I had the quote that brother Aaron read but I'm going to just read it again if that's all right he said heavens and earth have met God and man is reconciled a restored Eden has begun he said brother where's it at I look around me there's nothing but sorrow and sin and disappointments and failure and and and the world has fallen apart where's that story I tell you where it's at it's in your heart if you Reed the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you've been born again by the spirit of God where's that where is it going to start where's that edting going to restart where is the restoration going to begin I'll tell you look around look around this evening amen a restored Eden has begun Hallelujah and brother Brown said we're back in Fellowship again brother Brown compared us coming together seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he compared us coming together in a in a meeting like this in our church services amen he said with no differences among us he said oh that's like the fellowship they had in the Garden of Eden see where man would walk with God and there was no differences and amen there was a just a complete a a Oneness and a Unity between God and man amen and listen when are we going to come back to the Eden he said when the church gets back on speaking terms with God when the fellowship is re restored se he said just like all the curse of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts you you don't accept it it accepts you because it's God's attribute it's the holy ghost means God's spirit the attribute the thought of God has accepted you because you were ordained for that purpose see yet you were born in sin but God had that attribute and here you are expressed Amen on the earth and he comes down and gets you I love that he comes down and gets you amen see you're back here amen where you belong see sin has lost its power amen that's right the desire of sin has gone from your heart when the Holy Spirit comes in you are a restored person amen you are a restored person listen re God how many believ that Jesus Christ said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also he's going to prepare a place but brother BR the Church a book said it's a prepared place for a prepared people amen it wouldn't do no good for God to prepare a place without preparing a people amen there's got to be a restored person to live in a restored Eden amen it would never be a restored Eden except there's restored Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah amen and now when the Holy Spirit comes in your heart sin has lost his power now you're a restored person oh Hallelujah he said well I tell you I find this that the greatest power there is in the world is not the atomic bomb but a believer in contact with his maker it changes the whole attitude it changes his mental it changes his habits it changes his body it changes his nature it changes everything a believer in contact with his maker see Adam never had to be sick he never had to die he never had to worry he he he never had to have a heart heartache he never had to fear he just climbed up in the arms of a father like a child and everything was his see whatever he asked he just got everything obeyed him because he was God's child and a child is an heir of all things and when man fa he lost this but now what he lost in the fall Christ has come as a redeemer amen did you ever stop to think what Christ redeemed us for he gave us everlasting life he brought us back to Eternal fellowship and relationship to God to be his sons and daughters again to restore back all that Adam lost in the fall amen Amen brother Brown said Redemption claims they're in the breach amen many of you heard these things preached many times amen but I want you to understand tonight it's Amen brother B would say what that ought to do to a Believer to a believer Christian to realize that all that Adam lost amen is now in your possession amen what did Adam lost his rights to the tree of life amen his inheritance amen Divine fellowship with God that's what he truly lost there in the Garden of Eden amen but listen is all that Adam lost amen you possess amen you got a right to amen eat of the Tree of Life Again amen you amen Divine Fellowship has been restored back to every son and daughter of God Amen do you believe that oh yes sir amen you say brother what are you trying to say I'm trying to tell you this Paul said sin Shall Have No Dominion over you amen listen amen sin Shall Have No Dominion over you amen why amen because the scripture says Revelations 1:6 he hath made us he hath made us Kings and priest unto God amen amen listen brother man would picked that up in the church age book he said he ha made us oh amen there are certain truths that we need to emphasize and this is one of them he hath made us salvation is his doing amen salvation is of the lord it's all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are Kings spiritual kings and we're going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne amen how many believes that we're going to rule and reign with Christ we're going to be Kings with him when he sits on his throne but watch what he says but now but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom it says in Romans 5:17 for by one man's offense death Reign by one much more they which receive the abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteous shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ Colossians 1:13 amen the Bible says who had delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom or the reign of his dear son amen right now we reign with Christ right now we reign with Christ amen amen the the prophet said having dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is Christ in US willing in doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are set seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus hallelujah amen how many believes that this evening we are right now not one day we're going to be friends amen but right now even tonight I'm want to tell you
