yet through it all you have been good you have carried us through lord lord there's been deep waters there's been hard trials but through it all lord the lord that just wells up within me again you've been so good and we love you and we thank you lord thank you for this opportunity to start off this new year lord in your presence lord with an outpouring of moving of your spirit lord once again letting us know you'll never leave us or forsake us you're here with us thank you jesus lord i ask even now lord as we change the order of the service and begin to look at your word lord that you'll just continue to move and stir up our hearts lord recognizing what an opportunity we have lord may this be a night of worship a night of freedom lord a night where anyone that's bound is set free lord a night where each and every one of us can come up a little higher lord that's our desire that's where we're at right now lord ask you to take the word now and break it lord the bread of life to your children bless the word as we read it lord i ask you now that you'll just calm my nerves and allow me to speak in jesus name we pray these things amen amen amen if you look with me in your bible to the book of luke the 18th chapter oh my how wonderful he is how mighty is his name we're going to look in luke 18 verse 35 and then we're also going to read a portion of the book of mark amen didn't he good to us 1835 says and it came to pass that as he was coming nine to jericho a certain blind man set by the wayside begging and hearing the multitude pass by he asked what it meant and they told him that jesus of nazareth passeth by i believe he's passing by right now in this service and he cried saying jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and they which went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried so much the more thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and when he was come near he asked him saying what wilt thou that i should do unto thee and he said lord that i may receive my sight and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath saved thee and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto god amen amen if you'll look with me also in mark 10 verse 46 10 and 46. and we're reading the same story from a different account it says in and they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of timmius set by the highway side begging and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they called the blind man saying unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus and jesus answered and said unto him what wilt thou that i should do unto thee the blind man said unto him lord that i might receive my sight and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed jesus in the way amen you may have your seats this evening we ask that god would add his blessings to the reading of the word amen how wonderful i just have to be honest with you i'm trying to gather myself and it's such an incredible atmosphere i tell you what if if people think jumping shouting dancing's all for show couldn't nobody see me in the office that was just for me that was just for me you know i believe that we can start off the new year by letting the devil know i'm still here just let him know i'm still here you say but brother aaron i struggled in 2021 and i had my ups and downs in 2021 and but i want to say you're still here you're still here fighting you know just remind the devil tonight i'm still here he's been telling you that she was going to quit he's been telling you that you wasn't going to make it he's been telling you that you failed too many times he's been telling you that you was going to give up and quit look he's been telling some of y'all that for 20 years so tonight i feel like it's a good opportunity to start just letting him know devil we're still here we hadn't gone nowhere we hadn't given up we hadn't turned around and run we're still here fighting listen he has thrown everything he has at us he has thrown everything he has at us and yet here we are at the end of 2021 we've moved past it into 2022 and we're still here fighting and i'm just saying i want to encourage you if you haven't given up yet i don't believe you're going to give up i don't believe you're going to quit i don't believe you're going to go back because there's a c gene on the inside of god and that c gene is beginning to manifest itself and that seed gene can't quit it can't give up it came from god and it's going back to god i can't quit i didn't start this i didn't begin this i can't quit tonight and i want the devil to know i'm still here and i want us to look towards 2022 and now with an even greater fervency than what we've had in the past this isn't necessarily a a new year's message as it were but here we are it is the first service of the new year so i want to encourage us to look towards 2022 with greater fervency with a new determination to not only to survive another year but to walk in victory i'm not just going to drag through 2022 but i'm going to be victorious in 2022. i want us to to to within ourselves make a decision that i'm going to grab every opportunity that i have this year to serve the lord i want to grab a hold of every opportunity that i have in his presence i want to recognize every time that we come together in his presence that it's an opportunity for something to happen in my life it's an opportunity for something to happen in my family and maybe in the past we've come together and it's just been another wednesday night it's just been another church service and we've all been guilty of that from time to time but i want us in 2022 to take full advantage of every single opportunity that we have take full advantage that tonight i'm with believers of like precious faith i still have the freedom to worship there is a god who is moving in our midst and i want to take advantage of that tonight we got to be more like jacob tonight and then this opportunity i want as he passes by and you know he's here you've already felt him even if you didn't feel him his word says he's here so be like jacob tonight and even right now grab a whole tub and say lord i'm not letting you go tonight till you meet my need lord i felt your presence that was wonderful but i'm not letting you just move on by now i'm not letting you go i'm grabbing hold of you tonight and i'm not letting you go until you meet my need starting even tonight let's not just say oh okay 20 22. wednesday night right now starting tonight this is an opportunity for you to get your healing this is an opportunity for your deliverance this is an opportunity for you to find the freedom of worship that you've been looking for this is an opportunity for you to hear from god i hadn't heard from god in a long time brother aaron right now is your opportunity don't put it off till later tonight and i want you to make up your mind as we begin this service i'm not going to miss my opportunity in his presence tonight i'm not going to let it slip by i'm not going to miss this because see it's up to us to recognize our opportunities it's up to us to recognize whenever he's moving my i believe that these services are predestinated moments but but even we learned from the example of the prophet he could recognize a predestinated moment he could see the vision vision begin to unfold but then he had to be ready to step into that vision and play his part so yes this is a predestinated moment and yes it may be a moment for you but you got to recognize he's passing by you've got to be willing to step in you've got to be willing to lay aside the things holding you back in your own human emotion and your own human complexes and say this is my moment this is my opportunity and i'm gonna step in to this moment i'm not gonna let him pass me by tonight and that's exactly what we saw was we read the scripture there with bartimaeus he knew this was his chance he knew this was his opportunity it was his only chance he wasn't going to get this chance again tomorrow he wasn't going to have this chance again this was it and he wasn't going to let that opportunity passing by he recognized the urgency of the moment he recognized this is it i've been told about this this is the one why do i need to be so urgent brother and walmart because he's the answer to all your questions he's the answer to that family trouble that's been going on he's in the building tonight he's the answer to the tormentor that's been in your mind he's the answer to the sin question that's been plaguing you he's the answer to those questions in your heart of why he's the answer and he's here tonight and he's passing by we must constrain him some of you right now are looking into this new year looking into 2022 and you have more questions than you have answers you're looking you don't know where you're at you don't know what's gonna unfold none of us really do know exactly what's gonna unfold but your life is surrounded with questions you have more hurts than you can bear maybe you've been engulfed with grief depression's been knocking at your door pain and struggle more than you can bear i say it's okay to miss some things but don't miss him tonight don't miss him tonight because he's the answer to those questions he can meet every one of those needs what are you crying out to god for in this new year what are you crying out for because each and every one of us have needs you say well nothing really changed for me in 2021 well allow me to ask you did you seek something to change for you in 2021 did you cry out for your need every time he was near every one of us here tonight have needs we all have things that hinder us we all have things that keep us from being the christian that we really want to be and i just gotta gotta tell you there are some needs that will never be met without you making a move there are some things that will never change unless you make the move we're sitting back going god change me god change me god changed me and he passes by and he passes by and he passes by god changed me god changed me and he passes by but somebody's going to go jesus jesus i need you jesus i have a need but nothing changed for me but did you cry out to him did you seek him in 2021 for the change that you're looking for you know your need tonight you know where you lack and you know where you need to grow and i want to tell you tonight that wherever you are right now he's calling you and that's what i'm going to speak to you tonight on he calleth thee he calleth thee he's calling you tonight to something greater he's calling you to something more he's calling you tonight for me as i was looking at this i read this quote this spoke to my heart brother branham's singing and he said he says faith in the father faith in the son faith in the holy ghost these three are one demons will tremble and sinners awake faith in jehovah makes anything shake and for my heart for 2022 i want to echo this prayer of brother branham he goes right into this and says that's right oh my precious faith precious glorious faith god give me faith by faith abraham by faith isaac by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain him being yet dead yet testified oh how we need faith i love him i want more faith my desire in this life and for this new year coming is more faith in god god take away any doubt that's in my mind if there should ever arise one satan fights at me he fights at you he tries to shoot his arrows but may i have that shield of faith always before me to withstand the wiles of the devil to knock off his fiery darts is my sincere prayer and as we go into this at the beginning of this year that's where i'm at i'm asking you where are you at where do you need to grow what do you need deliverance from what is it that you're seeking in 2022 we read our opening scripture there about blind bartimaeus and brother branham does an incredible job of telling the story of bartimaeus in several places throughout our message and he goes all the way down through his life even explaining in great detail the difficulties in those days of how the odds that were stacked against bartimaeus i love stories like that because he says things like that and the odds weren't good and the odds were against him because it shows you that against all odds against all odds you're gonna make it against all odds in 2022 you're going to stand against all odds you will be the ones there in revelation 3 to him that overcome it look the odds don't really matter the odds don't matter tonight they didn't matter for bartimaeus because jesus was walking down the road they don't matter for you tonight because jesus is drawing near tonight and once jesus shows up the odds are no longer stacked against you once jesus shows up you and jesus is a majority once he shows up the odds are in your favor tonight so the odds don't matter regardless of how it looks jesus is in the building tonight against all odds you're still standing brother aaron is getting darker and darker and more and more evil my situation is worse than ever before you're sitting right where bartimaeus was sitting you're sitting in that same spot because it was his darkest hour and if anybody can that's been through anything will tell you it's in your darkest hour when jesus shows up it's in the darkest hour when he moves on the scene when you don't know how you're going to take another step when you don't know how you're going to stand when you don't know which way to turn that's when jesus comes walking on the scene it was bartimaeus's darkest hour brother branham would describe a situation like this in the first place he was shut off in a blind world dark never seen daylight that's a horrible condition he was penniless now to be poor and without money is a bad thing but to be shut off in a blind world without hope without mercy that's a tragic scene we have poor man ragged and his odds was against him he was shut off in darkness and was blind and was poor and was begging and in those days beggars strolled the streets everywhere lepers that couldn't work blind lame halt everything laid on the street and a beggar had a slim chance of getting anything to eat maybe the man had come out of of a morning had come and had one coin he could give to the poor and the first one he met he would flip it to him that settled it they probably didn't pay any attention to the beggars there was so numerous so many of them around that they didn't even pay attention to him it was really an awful condition life had not gone the way bartimaeus had intended it to go life had not gone the way bartimaeus had hoped it would maybe you're sitting here tonight 2021 didn't exactly go the way that you hoped it would maybe the last 10 years hadn't exactly gone the way that you hoped it would or the way that you figured it would and maybe you're staring at 20 22 tonight like what now what now last year wasn't good the year before that wasn't good i hadn't had a good year in a long time what now my job isn't exactly what i thought it was going to be it hadn't turned out the way i'd hoped my relationships ain't exactly how i'd hope my life isn't what i thought can i stop and tell you tonight that he's got it all in control can i tell you tonight that he's got plans for you that are greater than your thoughts he has plans for you to prosper you he has plans to see you through that he's calling you tonight through all those disappointments through all the grief and sorrow and pain he's calling you tonight to walk with him greater than ever before he's calling you tonight to more of him he's calling you tonight church to victory through him look right like life takes roads that we never saw coming life takes those twists and turns sometimes it's because we chose the wrong road sometimes it's just because life throws a curveball as it were things come out of nowhere and as a boy bartimaeus never thought about being blind his aspirations were never to be a beggar he was part of god's chosen people he had been told from the time of his birth you're part of the chosen people he'd been raised to believe in jehovah he was supposed to be blessed as one of those people as a part of god's chosen people blessings were supposed to be upon his life they were supposed to come a messiah one day and in his heart he thought as a little boy maybe i'll get to see him maybe i'll get to see the the messiah one day for myself oh but now that could never now happen never see him now i'll never have that opportunity brother branham says and he began to think this is bartimaeus sitting there that day of when he was a little boy running around over the hills just a little jewish lad of about seven or eight years old how he loved to pick the little yellow flowers off the banks of the jordan and the beautiful hill flowers of the palestine what pretty colors they had and how his little dark eyes used to look at those flowers when he would see the pretty skies the big white clouds but now it had been black many many years then he remembered how happy he would be when his jewish mother would call him to his midday lunch she would after he would eat and take him up in her arms and go out on the porch go to rocking him for his midday nap she'd stroke back his black hair patting on the cheek and how his eyes would see her beautiful face his mama oh how he could remember it brother branham describes it so clearly that it's almost painful to think of him sitting there listen church satan's cruel sin is cruel what's been done to this world because of the fall is cruel and it's awful but there's coming a day when all things are going to be made right there's coming a time when all those things are going to be wiped away bartimaeus is sitting there dwelling on these things and he remembered too that she used to tell him bible stories that's good for mothers to tell your children those things bring up a child and the way it should go and when it gets old it will not depart from you that's what the scripture says and she would rock him and tell him of the great jehovah and there he was setting blind and how he must have been thinking this little boy how his mama used to get him on her lap and tell him of the great stories of how god did great things and maybe his favorite story was when moses crossed the red sea or when joshua entered the promised land just a few hundred yards below where they were at oh how his little bright eyes would flash and say oh mother tell me that story again before you rock me to sleep and as he take his hands and pat her pretty cheeks as that young jewish mother rocked him little did he know that he'd be sitting there blind someday maybe some of you little did you know you'd be sitting here where you're at today in whatever situation in a condition you find yourself in this isn't what i intended to be this isn't where i intended to be how i intended to be i remember the bible stories i remember the things i wanted to grow up and serve god i wanted to grow up and go in a rapture i wanted to see the coming of the lord i wanted to be an overcomer but now but now look at me look where i'm at now this isn't what i intended to be i didn't intend to be in a lukewarm condition just a church member you know many times we talk about all these uh things that we people can be delivered from depression and anxiety pornography you name it and those things those are mighty deliverances but one of the hardest things to ever see someone delivered from is a lukewarm church member spirit because they don't recognize that the situation they're sitting in is one of death they don't recognize that they're just sitting there once again it's another wednesday night here i am none of us intended to be lukewarm church members none of us intended to be backslidden or sitting on a pew with sin in our life none of us started this race to not finish and yet here he is now i'll never see him i'm blind i'm blind i'm never going to see him i'm going to be a beggar all my life that's all i'll ever be this is who i am well the devil loves to get you in that place right there of this is just who i am this is just a family trait that's passed down i can't help it this is just a family thing this is how my daddy was this is who i am high passion runs in my family so it's an excuse for for my inability to constrain myself he gets you in that place oh this is just who i am and we get to where we think about we believe but we can't believe for ourselves oh they can be saved they can be set free yes he can be delivered they can shout and dance because they can receive the baptism of the holy ghost he won't ever follow me because i'm unworthy he won't move in my life it can never happen for me because this is my condition you've been told all the stories you know god has done wonderful things you know he did those wonderful things in brother branham's day mom and dad maybe have told you all the stories or maybe if you weren't raised in the message maybe you just heard it right here over the pulpit god sent a message you are a part of god's chosen people brother branham's ministry had mighty works evening like tabernacle has been mighty works and up until tonight it's all been stories up until that moment for bartimaeus it had all been stories it had been what mama told him mama told him there was a savior mama told him the red sea open mama told him about joshua but all those things that was just stories was moments away from becoming a reality he was moments away from an encounter that would change his life forever [Applause] up until this point has just been stories oh brother aaron i know salvation's promised but maybe it's not for me i know there's promised healing i know there's to be deliverance i know the holy ghost can be poured out on people i know there's a promised rapture but because of the condition you find yourself in tonight you don't think it's possible to obtain it for yourself you've been depressed so long that this is just who i am this is just how i have to live i've been sick so long that maybe healing's just not for me i've struggled with sin so long this is i can never be free i'm just not an overcomer i can't go in a rapture maybe i'll be granted life at the great white throne judgment you've been lukewarm so long i'll never be on fire like that brother i'll never have that close relationship with the lord like that sister does i've been bound by fear for so long there's so much fear it's fear that keeps people from freedom of worship i've been bound by fear so long that i'll never be able to worship freely like all those others do i'll never have that true freedom of joy that comes with being set free in the presence of almighty god i'll never have that i'll never have that i'll never have that but i say it's 20 22 and jesus is calling you tonight it's 2022 and he's walking down your road tonight it's 20 22 and if you choose those things you know don't have to just say stories they can be a reality right here on a wednesday night an evening like tabernacle for you for your children in your life it doesn't have to remain a story tonight brother brown says let's just think of the old beggar sitting there now in his racket clothes shivering down into the shadows he didn't know how far he had to go to get into the sunshine maybe get run over by a horse if he got out any further sitting there in that hopeless helpless condition and not knowing that just right down the road comes salvation there might be that one person sitting here tonight maybe not so desperate as that man was but not knowing that right here in the next hour is salvation for you so the man anyhow is blind sitting there winter time coming on hopeless helpless nothing to eat hungry setting outside of the walls of a great cruel city and it's coming winter time shivering in the cold what a tragic scene my picture that could picture some darkness and not knowing that just down the road a little peace come relief for him there might be some of you sitting here tonight in almost that condition hopeless as far as medical is concerned helpless as far as any help is concerned and don't know that maybe standing right near you stands your healing just as close as it was to blind bartimaeus maybe tonight you don't realize that standing right next to you is healing for your sickness it's joy for that depression is salvation for your lost soul standing right next to you tonight i don't even believe it's something we have to guess about because i know the angel of the lord is in this building even now there is deliverance for each and every one of you whatever you have need of jehovah jireh is here things have been bad for bartimaeus blindness have robbed him of the life that he could have had blindness had turned him into a beggar and blindness was his taskmaster but all that was just about to change he was about to have his moment he was about to have his opportunity in his presence and it was all about to change not because a priest came walking by not because a preacher came walking by or a minister but because god almighty the lord and savior jesus christ was walking by he was going to see the messiah for himself he was going to see him tonight you have the opportunity to see for yourself not mama's story not daddy's story not brother tim's testimony not brother joe's testimony but your own testimony your own opportunity at a back side of the desert burning bush experience your healing your deliverance your salvation you have that opportunity tonight but some things will never change if you're not willing to cry out some things will never change if you just allow yourself to sit there as he moves past you but here in this presence wherever you find yourself right at this moment know this jesus is passing by he's passing by even now no matter how dark it is the stories are about to become a reality for you if you want them to he was about to find out that blindness wasn't how he had to live if you want to not you can find out that depression isn't how you have to live you can find out that salvation is for you tonight you can find out that the holy ghost is for you tonight you can find out that joy is for you tonight you don't have to live for depression you don't have to live beat down you don't have to live walking around listen you can find out tonight you're not going to commit suicide you are going to walk in life you're going to walk in victory you're going to walk as an overcomer you were not caught in this age for death you were not caught in this age for the grave you were called in this age young person to overcome to take a rapture you're not going to quit listen to the lying spirit of the enemy find out tonight that life is for you that he is passing by your way and begin to lay claim to it and cry out to him jesus have mercy on me what would you have for me tonight lord i need the holy ghost lord i need to see i need deliverance i need freedom from this depression thy faith has saved thee you have to move towards him tonight satan has warned against you to try to make you miss your opportunity he's trying to get you to miss it because if he gets too far and you let it go and you walk out of the place and you walk out of this atmosphere and you let that opportunity miss you pass you by so he's trying to war at you right now it's just wednesday night brother aaron's just up there railing and going on just whatever what am i doing tomorrow i got this going on so much has already happened this week and i got school tomorrow and he's trying to make you miss your opportunity but i say he's too late i say he's too late because there's a people recognizing that i'm here and jesus is here and he is the need supplier and he can take care of whatever i have need of and he's already calling you it's too late because satan may be whispering in your ear but jesus called us the tonight he's calling you tonight i say constraining for yourself constraining for your family constraining for your need constraining for everything you have need of that's exactly what bartimaeus did he seized the moment brother brown says and here he was sitting out there shut off in a dark world along the side along the side of him run the jericho road running up to jerusalem the cobblestones in the road was well polished for many travelers going back and forth over the road over the same road great warrior joshua led the children of israel many years before over the same road walked elijah and elijah as they went to jordan no doubt this old blind beggar sitting there saying in this dark world if i'd only lived in the day when elijah and elisha passed by i would have cried out and they would have prayed for me how many of us had i'd have been in brother brown's meeting he'd have called me out he'd have prayed for me jesus is calling you out tonight he's calling you tonight he said they would have prayed for me and god would have given me my sight but now all the people in the city and around say the days of miracles pass but perhaps down in his heart he believed that god still lived oh how little did he know that just down the road come his deliverance i wonder if that ain't our case tonight i hope it is you know for bartimaeus it seemed like just another day of begging it seemed like just another day in that blind condition he made his way to that spot just like any other day he wondered would he receive anything today just like any other day would somebody give me a coin today or will i be passed by once again you made your way tonight just like any other wednesday set where you normally sit unless somebody had your seat now you're in a bad mood and you wondered will i get anything today i've been here before came like usual others seem to receive coins others seem to receive a handful on purpose others get blessings others get delivered but could i possibly get something today or will i be passed by once again luke 18 35 and it came to pass that as he was come nigh to jericho a certain blind man set by the wayside begging and hearing the multitude pass by he asked what it meant and they told him that jesus of nazareth passed by brother branham said blind bartimaeus said if i could only been sitting at this gate when the chief captain of the host of the lord would have been standing there i would have gotten my healing if i'd just know that his presence was there little did he know that less than 200 yards from him right there came the same captain the lord jesus the captain of the host of the lord then all of a sudden there was a noise isn't it most unusual that where jesus is there's usually a lot of noise and we hear them coming out the gates screaming and some hollering hosanna to him that cometh in the name of the lord others saying thou mighty prophet of galilee and others saying away with him he's a witch he's beelzebub he does nothing but deceive the people he's a spiritualist he's a mind reader away with such a hypocrite and they were throwing at him over ripe vegetables i suppose i can hear him as some saying one thing and the other another in the great rush coming on and do you know where jesus is there's usually a mixed multitude like that it's always that way there's a mixed multitude some form and some against him but he comes walking on i can see him as he walks quietly a little frail looking body as he moved on up the side of the road some screaming one thing and another and all of a sudden there comes a sharp voice that blind bartimaeus can hear and as i see him sitting there and he started to raise up and the crowds was pushing him over and he falls to his knees and he said what's all this disturbance who is it passing by some of them pushing him off sit down and finally a kind-hearted lady bend down over the old beggar kind of lifts him back to his feet and says kind lady would you be so good as to tell me what's all this russian disturbance about oh sir perhaps you don't understand that this is that galilean prophet that's going by what galilean prophet my lovely lady what galilean prophet i've never heard of such a one it's jesus of nazareth the son of david are you acquainted with the scriptures blind sir oh yes i'm acquainted with the scriptures i was just sitting here in the sun thinking about the great jehovah god well this man who's passing by is jesus of nazareth his son who heals the sick who does good kind things to people oh you don't mean that's the son of david now he's too far gone down the road i'll never be able to get through that mob he's almost 100 yards to the road and then maybe 200 yards down the road how will i ever do it and that's where the enemy is and some of your ears tonight is too far gone your opportunity has already passed you by he's too far away from you you live too long in sin you've done too many things but if he is the son of david the spirit of god is in him and if he's the son of david he can hear my cry and he screams oh jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and the scripture says and he cried saying jesus the son of david have mercy on me and they that went before him rebuked him that he should hold his peace i find it amazing brother branham talks about how there's no way he could have actually heard him but he reached in that spirit world his heart reached out and touched jesus so some people want to take that and say well i don't really have to cry out he knows my heart and truth but i find it amazing that in the midst of the ruckus that brother branham described people yelling people shouting people throwing things it's an absolute mob and yet bartimaeus acted so loud that he disturbed the mob this wasn't just jesus jesus everybody was saying jesus amen jesus jesus jesus [Applause] jesus i need you this isn't one chance jesus to the point that the mob goes sit down and shut up he was out of order even to the mob he didn't care it was his chance when it's your chance why do you care what i care what do you care what i think why do you care what he thinks it's your chance it's your moment it's your opportunity jesus it's for you why do you care what the mob thinks you know the same spirits alive today oh you're going there again yep yeah let somebody begin to cry out and scream and let them cry out for deliverance well there goes that emotion again why do you have to do well because it worked for bartimaeus figured i'd give it a try it worked for others let somebody get a little taste of freedom boy you want to hear the chicken squawk let somebody get a little taste of freedom let somebody get healed let somebody get delivered from an evil spirit begin to shout and scream and worship sit down shut up pentecostalism just respond to the word in order what we need is sane and sensible just sit down and be sane and sensible you're preaching all work up and emotion i'm preaching freedom evening like tabernacle 20 22 i say be free i say be free in church be free in your life be free in your worship don't worry about what i think don't worry about what anybody thinks be free it's your opportunities it's your moments it's your predestinated times be free the message that we preach brought freedom it's 2022 and i'm not about to let them put my worship back in a denominational box of this is how it has to be this is how sane and sensible and don't do this and don't do that the message brought freedom not bondage so i choose to be free tonight i choose to worship in spirit i choose to shout i choose to let the spirit move on me and move however he chooses to move me that's how i choose to be in 2022 he's calling you tonight some of you been wanting the same thing and now you're being called to a freedom of worship even tonight you're being called to be let loose in the atmosphere of the holy spirit he's calling you to praise him with your whole heart he's calling you to praise him with everything he deserves your everything he's calling you to forget about your need for control and step out into the realms of the holy spirit and let him have control [Applause] that's not who i am i'm not worried about who you are it's about who he is and what he's done and his spirit moving through a congregation why do they have to get all excited maybe if you understood where they come from you know people not in the battle don't understand people not fighting things don't get it maybe if you knew the silent wars and their deepest struggles maybe if you saw the tears at night as they lay in the bed and the heartaches maybe if you felt their hurts then you would actually rejoice with them when they found freedom rejoice with them when they found peace i don't understand why they have to act that way i had a young person say in one of our church services this is the only place i don't hurt it's the only place i don't hurt because of scars and torments and anxieties and fears i'm sorry if they want to get free in worship go ahead i'm sorry i'm not going to hold it against them if they want to dance and shout and run you know how you overcome that spirit join them want to overcome that critical spirit and understand what it's all about join them one time rejoice in their victory rejoice in their overcoming rejoice in their salvation better yet get your own and rejoice in your salvation rejoice in your victory rejoice [Applause] spirit begins to move move with it we got something to rejoice about more than any other people we've heard a call in this day oh come on the enemy went and put you in a pen bound you up said this is where you have to live this is the condition you have to live with this is what you are these are your problems this is what you must eat this is your sickness lukewarm is all you're ever going to be this is how you have to worship but tonight mama eagle's calling mama eagle's coming and he's calling you tonight he's calling you tonight and you're beginning to realize that there ain't a fence high enough to hold you there ain't a pen big enough to keep you bound down oh come on church set your wings a little bit this evening set your wings a little bit and jump up on a fence post as brother browning would say said brother aaron i don't know how to fly that's okay just jump up on the fence post a little bit just get up on the fence post and start flopping your wings a little bit i don't know how to fly doesn't matter the chicken's gonna get mad at you anyway get up there and begin to worship oh i can't worship with all that noise jesus i can't hear the preacher when they're doing all that shouting jesus oh you're making it dusty in my pen jesus i'm sorry mr chicken but i've just heard from my heavenly father my heavenly father said i can be free he said i can be saved he said i could be healed he's acting on my family jesus glory jesus you know chickens and eagles heard the same scream they was in the same church service eagle jumped up on the fence posting making dust fly everywhere shouting chickens [Laughter] chickens always squawking chicken what's all that noise can't feed with all that screaming going on you know i find it amazing that they couldn't stand the fact that bartimaeus didn't have church order they would have rather him sit there silent and blind and there's churches around this message today that would rather you sit there silent in church order and be bound with every demon of hell every pornography but as long as you sit there and you sit there and act right and act like this is church and this is how it's supposed to be and they're bound and they can't have any freedom and they can't get loose and the bartimaeus stands up to say jesus they sit down sit down no not even like tabernacle no i say get loose i say get free i say be delivered if you gotta shout shout if you gotta jump jump whatever it takes cry out to him jesus they want you to sit down lukewarm and just say i believe the message no barnums believed that was the son of god he believed this was the message that's why he cried out that's what caused him to scream out this is my moment this is my time the one that i have need of is passing by sit down shut up can't do it why are you getting so excited because it's my opportunity it's my moment i've heard from that other round he told me depression don't have a hold on me he told me that he was calling me out of my grief he told me that he was calling me out of my sickness into health he told me he was calling me to a refilling of the holy ghost in 2022 and i'm gonna respond to it brother branham said he's your father he loves you and his nest stirring time has already come but we need another jump we got to the barnyard post but we need to get free so we can just ride on his wings for our first solo flight what a joy it will be when that great final day comes those who know how to jump and flop their wings those who know how to do it someday he shall come the great eagle of the sky shall come in glory and he will spread forth his great power the holy spirit and those who are magnetized to it shall take a ride for eternity forever you know we got this canceled culture that seems to be a thing these days even in the message there seems to be a message cancelled culture do they want to cancel the moving of the spirit look i believe in cancel culture and the message i believe it's time to cancel the devil i believe it's time to cancel formal church services i believe it's time to cancel intellectual lectures that have no life in them but produce nothing but death i believe we cancel those things and here's how you do it luke 18 39 but he cried so much the more thou son of david had mercy on me it was his moment it was his time and he didn't care who was around he didn't care if he seemed fanatic brother branham says there's his first and last chance he'll never pass that way again that's his only hope how do we know that tonight that there isn't men and women sitting here that's your only hope he may never pass this way again mark 10 49 and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they called the blind man saying unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee brother and the devil says it's not for me tonight rise he calleth thee i'm so full of fear rise he calleth thee i'm so wrapped up in worldly things rise he calleth thee i need more of god this year brother aaron rise he's calling you tonight i want to know him like never before rise he calleth thee he's calling you out tonight don't let that go past you he's calling you tonight you are in his presence right now and he's calling you right now it doesn't really matter how wrapped up you are it doesn't really matter what condition you're in i feel so dead inside listen you're no more dead than lazarus was he was four days dead he was four days dead when jesus came on the scene look i want to say something to even like tabernacle tonight to encourage us as we go forward and i've dealt with this other places but i want to tell you this maybe this isn't for you tonight maybe you're sitting there and your christian life is as pristine as it can be maybe there's nothing holding you no chains on your life maybe you're well and mind well in body well in spirit saved sealed and all is right in your world congratulations i don't believe you but congratulations but you still got a role to play in this service because see jesus came to call lazarus's name but if we'll look in john 11 28 it says and when she had said so she went her way and she called mary her sister secretly saying the master has come and calleth for thee now you may be sitting there not going oh i know exactly who this is for well my son he's been battling this and my daughter and all that family over there they need you well if that's your attitude you need it worse than they do but let me stay on track and you recognize and it's for somebody else listen mary and martha knew that he was there and that lazarus was the one in need in that moment but the master called her you still have a part to play in this service he's calling your name in this service because see there was a stone that needed rolling away how about we start coming to the services and start rolling stones away from tombs how about we come and we begin to pray and we begin to call on the name of the lord we begin to push that stone that we knows over that tomb push that stone that's holding your brother push that stone that's holding your children push that stone we want to see healing we want to see deliverance we want salvation and yet what are we doing to accommodate it there are stones that need to be pushed that person right there is all bound up is there any hope didn't seem like there was any hope for lazarus but there was a stone that needed to be rolled and once that stone was moved out the way there was a name about to be cold and there was a name that went down down into that tomb down into the depths of the dead down into the regions wherever lazarus was at and he heard his name called but it was because somebody else had helped push and roll a stone out the way we got to start gathering in 2022 pushing with all our might together shoulder to the wheel shoulder to the stone let's move this stone let's see resurrection life let's see salvation let's see the holy ghost i'm going to push on this stone tonight with everything that's in me that way names can be called resurrections can take place maybe you're sitting here tonight just like bartimaeus you've been taught right but something's come in and cause blindness you can't see yourself being saved you can't see yourself being delivered you can't see yourself being free see one thing i've learned is that the devil wants to make you think that his oppression and his sickness and his depression and those things are permanent he wants to make you feel like they're unending and when you feel like something's unending i'll say this not to make a joke but to make a point christmas eve i had a kidney stone you know what makes it so bad you don't know when it's ever gonna end if you told me in two hours this is gonna pass i got this it ain't gonna be fun but i got this that's the thing with the trial you don't know when it's gonna end and so he wants you to think it's permanent that it's forever because in forever you begin to give up hope about four o'clock on christmas eve i gave up hope i said that's all i got i gotta go to the hospital the whole time i was like i can do this i can pass this no no my wife and the kids and i i joked about this ain't really how it went but they were on their way out to celebrate christmas with brother tim i said i don't want to ruin christmas for everybody so y'all just dropped me off at the emergency room so they barely slowed down door opened up i fell out and i just went on to have christmas my mama came up there to be with me i told that nurse i said i wasn't being very tough y'all i know that shocks you guys i told that nurse i said i'm trying to be tough she said son i ain't never seen a tough man with a kidney stone it's okay i said you don't know daryl baxter that man's tough batman stuff but he wants you to think that his oppression and his trials are permanent that your sickness is forever and that's where bartimaeus was but the time was fast approaching where he wasn't gonna be blind no more what am i telling you tonight the time is fast approaching that you ain't gotta be depressed anymore that your loved one ain't gonna be lost no more that you're not gonna walk around burning down anymore because the king of kings and the lord of lords is passing through the building it's not a permanent situation you're not permanently lost you have not missed your day of grace you do not have to stay sick forever you can be free tonight you can be set free tonight because jesus is in the building nothing that satan does is permanent nothing satan does is eternal but the works of my god they are forever they are fraternal they are permanent they hold the anchor holds when it grabs on it won't let you go satan tries to hold and he tries to bind and he can't hold you but once that anchor holds it'll never let go he's calling you tonight we begin to wrap this up i want us to look at bartimaeus's response to the call mark 10 and 50 and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus now i want us to focus in on this real good as we come down notice that it says he cast away his garment this was important enough for the scripture to take note of it because this is no small thing this is no little thing because it was a declaration of freedom it was a declaration of i'm leaving that life behind and i'm never going back to it ever again it was declaring to the world what was about to happen before it ever happened is there people here tonight that can declare to the world things that are about to happen before they ever happen the things that you're wanting to see in 2022 and you can begin to testify and declare that those things are going to happen you see that coat that he threw away had to be worn in order to legally beg it was a beggar's garment and you had to wear it in order to be allowed to collect alms it qualified you as an arm collector it identified you as a beggar it was his identification that i am in a bound condition that i can't make it that i can't overcome that i need these arms to survive listen he didn't take it and fold it neatly and fold it nicely and put it there and that way in case something don't happen here i can come back to it in case i don't get the holy ghost that i'm seeking tonight i can come back to it in case i don't get delivered i've got it set right there but he took that beggar's garment and he said 2022 i don't need this anymore and he threw it aside and it was a declaration i will not beg anymore i will not be defeated anymore but something's about to happen something's about to change something is going to be changed forever it's a declaration of freedom i don't need these slave clothes anymore i don't need these grave garments anymore hallelujah before jesus had ever even spoke to him he said from this time on i will no longer beg i'm about to get my eyesight you got to come tonight with the same attitude this is it this is it it's over it's finished i'm not going back to it i'm not going back to it we are closing i'm not gonna wear this live oppression anymore i'm not gonna walk under this condemnation any longer i'm not gonna wear luke warmness as my daily garment any longer the coat of sin is being cast aside tonight see the devil wants to identify you with your affliction identify you as a beggar see he doesn't call your name he tries to change your name he does all he can to keep you from hearing your name so he calls you things and as long as you respond to it he'll keep calling you that but take that robe off tonight he's trying to bring confusion to try to change your identity he put labels on you labels of failure labels of sickness labels of suicide garments that would identify you with sin young people just for a minute he tries to offer you drinks of his water water that does nothing but keep you thirsty for more there's a thirst on the inside of all of us and the only real truth thirst quencher is god so that was what was wrong with the woman at the well she was so thirsty she didn't know how to quench that thirst she wanted somebody to love her she wanted someone to accept her she wanted to belong she wanted to have friends all good things but she began to drink of the water offered by the enemy don't drink that water if we had time tonight i could spend time describing to you the scars as i was saying to one of my friends the other day sometimes young people will look at a minister in somebody and everything they went through and say oh but look they turned out okay you can't understand the scars and the heartaches and even the torment that you will go through yes you may be saved you will be saved but what i'm trying to get you to do is don't drink that water tonight there are things that you may recover from and you may have eternal life and become a wonderful christian person but those things are hindrances in your life the rest of your life their struggles and their trials and their mind battles and that water leaves you thirsty and it leaves you scarred and it leaves you with broken homes and it leaves you with addictions and it leaves you with death and so many of us don't know how to quench that thirst but i'm telling you the thirst quencher's calling you tonight he calleth thee he's calling you and some of you are so thirsty you don't know how to quench it so you try social media and you search for likes and you search for followers and you search for validation and vindication in that way and you're so thirsty so you put on garments of worldly music or you try the garments of drugs or you slip on immoral clothes that scream i'm thirsty i'm thirsty i need attention i need i need validation i need people to like me i need to be accepted i'm thirsty and that drink does nothing but leave you more thirsty and it leads you here and it leads you there and the whole time you're picking up new regrets and you're picking up new scars and new pains and here's a temporary joy for just a moment but then it's followed by loads of sadness and guilt and then thoughts of suicide and yet the whole time there's a thirst quencher calling you he's calling you tonight and you're thirsty and you know you need that drink you can throw that garment off tonight if you've been in that water you can throw that garment off tonight because they become more than garments they become chains and the woman at the whale had completely lost her identity she was no more that lovely little girl that grew up on her daddy's knee that sweet little child she wasn't that no more she was an unclean woman who no one would even associate with and that was the garment that she had to wear on a daily basis that was her identity because in search for acceptance she had found emptiness and loneliness but see there was a thirst quencher who had need to go by samaria and you may not be in the condition of the woman at the well tonight but there was a thirst quencher who had need to come by evening like tabernacle tonight for your need and he's coming to meet you at the well tonight and one moment in his presence and all those things they were no longer her identity they became her testimony that led others to the thirst quencher the drink that he gave her not only was it enough for her but it overflowed her soul to the point that she wanted others to have it and she was no longer bound and ashamed and tormented but she could run into the city and those things that she used to be so ashamed of she said hey y'all know all those things i did all those things i did you know those things that used to identify me come see a man come see a man who took that all the way come see a man who changed my life come see a man and what did she say to that city he's calling you too he's calling you and he's calling each and every one of us tonight to take a drink of that water whatever you're dealing with tonight whatever it's called anxiety fear unbelief lukewarmness whatever it is it's a cruel taskmaster and it's trying to hold you and say this is who you are and he's trying to tell you that you just can't be free he's even convinced a lot of you that you have an evil spirit and brother branham is asking questions and answers i can't give over completely to jesus have i an evil spirit brother brown says i think that you're possessed of an evil spirit i think an evil spirit anoints you with those thoughts to make you think that you cannot surrender yourself to god when let me show you something why would you want to surrender to him because there's something out there calling to you to surrender it's a very good sign that you ought to surrender yourself it's a very good sign stand together with me if you will satan is trying his best in this service to keep you from crying out because jesus has been here and he is here and he's moving through this audience even now for your need brother aaron i don't have a bunch of sin in my life that's fine you have needs we all do none of which will be met if we don't move and we don't cry out he's telling you you're fine stay quiet don't move he can't keep it quiet forever he can't hold you down forever because he calleth thee he's calling you in this service even now brother branham says god's seen you before the foundation of the world he's seen you a human being like you are and though there come a million years yet there's nothing can keep you from coming back to that perfect image that god ordained for you in the beginning strangers they will not follow there's one voice calling you [Music] but the great shepherd's calling you tonight it's calling you for more luke 18 41 saying what will thou that i shall do unto thee this way he's asking you tonight what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee and he said lord that i may receive my sight and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith has saved thee and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god he's calling you tonight what's he calling me to brother aaron i'm not a blind man calling you to salvation calling you to
