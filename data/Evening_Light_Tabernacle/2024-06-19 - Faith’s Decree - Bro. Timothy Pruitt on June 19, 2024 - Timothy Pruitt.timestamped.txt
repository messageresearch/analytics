[40:35] Luke 8 and verse 22 said now it came to

[40:40] a ship with his disciples and he said
[40:43] unto them let us go over unto the other
[40:46] side of the lake and they launched forth
[40:49] but as they sailed he fell asleep and
[40:52] there came down a storm of wind on the
[40:54] lake and they were filled with water
[40:57] and were in Jeopardy and they came to
[41:00] him and awoke him saying master master
[41:02] we
[41:03] perish then he arose and rebuked the
[41:05] winds and the Raging of the waters and
[41:07] they ceased and they were calm and he
[41:10] said unto them where is your faith and
[41:13] they being afraid wondered saying one to
[41:15] another what manner of man is this for
[41:17] he commandeth even the winds and Waters
[41:21] and they obey him amen let you be seated
[41:28] just like to speak to you this evening
[41:30] on Faith's
[41:31] decree decree is an official order
[41:35] issued by a legal Authority it's
[41:38] official order issued by a legal
[41:41] Authority you know the song says and I I
[41:44] was listen listening to a tape and heard
[41:46] brother brandham sing this or quote it
[41:49] there's the song you know when they ring
[41:51] those golden bells for you and me said
[41:54] there's a land beyond the river that we
[41:56] call all the sweet forever and we only
[41:59] reach that Shore by Faith's
[42:03] decree and we will only reach that sweet
[42:05] Forever by Faith's decree and what what
[42:08] is Faith decree it is the word of God it
[42:12] is not my word or my wishes or what I
[42:15] want or what I might say but it is the
[42:18] word of God and because he has spoken it
[42:21] we will reach that Shore just as
[42:23] disciples as he would tell them let us
[42:26] go into the other side and then when
[42:28] they begin to quit he didn't tell them
[42:29] about what was coming you know God
[42:31] doesn't do that he doesn't always tell
[42:33] you about the things you're going to go
[42:34] through but he said let's go to the
[42:36] other side that was actual a decree
[42:39] let's go to the other side of the lake
[42:41] and and if they would have took him at
[42:43] what he said they would have known that
[42:44] no matter what come or what went on or
[42:46] what happened they were going to make it
[42:49] to the other side and so we will only
[42:52] reach that place that is so that place
[42:54] is that is so impossible to describe
[42:56] with the these human limited abilities
[42:59] we we haven't been there and even if we
[43:01] did go there for a moment and come back
[43:03] it would still be hard to describe the
[43:05] grander and the beauty that awaits a
[43:08] Believer who goes to that place and and
[43:10] that's just a portion of what awaits us
[43:13] amen but you but you will only see it by
[43:16] living by faith speaking by faith
[43:19] speaking Faith decree and facei decree
[43:22] is a decree it's official order given by
[43:24] a legal Authority it's the the decree is
[43:27] the word of God it's the word of God
[43:30] that's what faith speaks that's where
[43:33] Faith Finds Its place to rest you know
[43:35] Faith always looks to the word that's
[43:38] the only stable place faith can find to
[43:40] rest upon amen Faith places itself upon
[43:43] the unmovable Rock that's God's Eternal
[43:46] Word Faith doesn't look at reason I
[43:48] don't care how much you can show it we
[43:50] be better or something else would be
[43:52] more realistic if the word says no faith
[43:55] rests right there if the word says yes
[43:58] Faith rest right there that is the
[44:00] sanctuary of Faith's resting place now a
[44:04] place of rest is a place of stability
[44:06] now I I don't know if you where where
[44:08] you like to find places of rest but you
[44:11] want a place where you feel safe and you
[44:13] feel that things around you are okay and
[44:15] everything's you know for a moment that
[44:17] you can get some rest you want to lay
[44:19] down in that place amen I I I I I look
[44:22] at some of these people that go and
[44:23] sleep on a on a side of a cliff hanging
[44:26] out and they want to see that I I don't
[44:28] care nothing about being there because
[44:29] that's not someplace I think I can get
[44:31] some rest but I want to be in my own bed
[44:33] or a place that I feel like amen there's
[44:36] a safe place where I can close my eyes
[44:39] and just rest and what in the night and
[44:41] I that's how faith it looks for a place
[44:44] amen not on things that are unstable
[44:46] which is our reasonings or our own
[44:48] thoughts or our own thinking but it
[44:50] looks for a place where it can just
[44:51] close its eyes of the whatever the word
[44:53] says it it just takes what the word says
[44:56] if it says yes it's yes if it says no
[44:58] it's no and it just rests right there
[45:01] upon that you know I I've been looking
[45:03] I've been learning some things there at
[45:05] home turn with using the lathe and
[45:08] something struck me the other day as I
[45:09] was turning I I you know I made pens
[45:12] some of y'all have seen some of those
[45:13] saying and and you know have a little
[45:15] block of wood spinning around at a high
[45:17] rate speed is not all that scary you got
[45:19] a face shield on or whatever it's just a
[45:21] little small piece that you make a pen
[45:23] out of but then I decided you know I I
[45:25] want a bigger lathe and I I want want to
[45:27] make bigger things and make bowls or
[45:29] whatever and so I I just thought well
[45:31] man if I can make a pen I can make a
[45:32] bowl but it's a whole lot of whole lot
[45:34] of difference between the two one the
[45:36] wood that's spinning around it's not
[45:38] just just like that it's woo woo woo and
[45:41] you're looking at this wood and you
[45:43] don't want that thing coming off and
[45:44] slinging you and hit you in the face and
[45:46] the tools are different that you use but
[45:48] there's something That Remains the Same
[45:51] that with whatever size of Lathe or
[45:53] whatever thing that you you you whatever
[45:55] size that you use there's one thing
[45:57] that's Remains the Same is called the
[45:59] rest and and it's a place where you can
[46:01] place your tool upon and you can turn it
[46:03] wherever you want it and maneuver it
[46:05] from that place but if that tool is not
[46:07] on that rest then you're going to be in
[46:09] a world of hurt there's going to be wood
[46:11] flying there's going to be things that
[46:12] are how they get a catch as they call it
[46:14] and those things are very scary I've got
[46:16] a few of them because why I realized I
[46:19] didn't have that tool in the place where
[46:21] it was supposed to be I was trying on my
[46:23] own abilities to do something but if I
[46:25] would just lay that tool upon the rest
[46:28] and just move it across on that rest and
[46:30] it would carve it right out and I got to
[46:33] thinking about that as I was watching it
[46:35] take place before my eyes because I
[46:36] watch you know watched a lot of YouTube
[46:38] and trying to figure it out and and and
[46:40] and watching watching something and
[46:42] doing something's two totally different
[46:43] things but as I begin to do it I begin
[46:46] to realize if I turn it this way but as
[46:48] long as I keep that thing on that rest
[46:50] then it's really not my personal ability
[46:53] to hold it or to do it but it's on the
[46:56] rest and on there it can cut the wood as
[46:58] it's supposed to do and I thought God if
[47:00] we can just keep ourself upon our rest
[47:03] and that is the word of God then when we
[47:06] come across hard times or we come across
[47:08] things that we don't know how to handle
[47:10] and it seems to be going woo woo woo in
[47:12] our life amen if we just lay there upon
[47:14] the rest God will carve that out God
[47:17] will move it God will change it amen
[47:19] because we but we have to be say
[47:21] centered in that place of rest and that
[47:24] place of rest is only the word of God
[47:27] it's not a good book it's not a it's not
[47:29] somebody's thoughts or somebody's
[47:31] thinking it's only on what God has
[47:33] declared now you you can rely on Hope
[47:36] but you know if you just rely on hope
[47:37] you know what hope is Hope is something
[47:39] that puts something out further out
[47:42] there somewhere brother BR talks about
[47:44] he said when you rely on Hope You Hinder
[47:46] Faith he said hope is something that's
[47:48] looking for something way off but Faith
[47:50] looks at it as right now Faith said God
[47:53] says so and it's mine amen that settles
[47:56] it I don't care if I'm still crippled if
[47:58] I'm still blind if I'm still sick they
[48:01] don't have nothing to do with it I
[48:03] believe it anyhow it's mine to have God
[48:06] said it and it's settled that's Faith
[48:09] Hope says what God said so and I'm
[48:12] expecting to get it somewhere somehow
[48:15] someday but as long as Satan can put you
[48:18] off on to another day he'll just keep
[48:20] that going on day after day after day
[48:23] and you'll never get it but if you'll
[48:24] just believe it's right now now my
[48:27] personal property faith is the substance
[48:30] of things hoped for the evidence of
[48:32] Things Not Seen Faith acts right now
[48:35] it's positive he said I tell you
[48:37] sickness and everything else when Faith
[48:39] steps in it just like snowballs on a hot
[48:42] stove everything else just melts away
[48:45] because faith has come and took its
[48:48] place of rest faith has rested upon the
[48:50] word of God When Faith speaks every else
[48:54] keeps still these old sicknesses this
[48:56] Burling around like this and saying days
[48:59] of Miracles are pass or you might get it
[49:01] another day but let Faith Step Up R time
[49:04] and pull its muscles back and say I'm
[49:06] here to take over he said I tell you the
[49:08] rest of them things will keep still When
[49:11] Faith does that that's the fellow we
[49:13] want to deal with that's Faith amen we
[49:16] want faith we don't want just hope we
[49:18] don't want to just hope so or hope God
[49:21] might do it or hope maybe to happen we
[49:23] want to believe that God's already said
[49:25] it it's already already done it's
[49:27] already finished and I can have it right
[49:30] now that's what my faith is declaring
[49:33] the word of God Amen how do we get faith
[49:36] faith comes by hearing hearing what the
[49:39] word of God Amen that's right you can
[49:41] base it on nothing else but the word of
[49:44] God but you know faith has a
[49:46] voice faith has a voice amen it's a
[49:49] declaration that has to there's there's
[49:51] a difference between a declaration and a
[49:53] decree if you'll study the two words
[49:55] amen there's there the faith has a voice
[49:58] it has to actually declare what the word
[50:01] has said amen Matthew 17 would say Jesus
[50:04] would say if you have faith you shall
[50:06] say to this mountain not look at the
[50:09] mountain not come the next day and look
[50:10] at the mountain but say to the mountain
[50:13] you shall say I love how he put it he
[50:16] didn't say go get you a preacher and say
[50:18] or go get a prophet and say but he said
[50:21] if you have faith you can say to this
[50:23] mountain be thou removed see the action
[50:26] of Bible faith is speaking the word of
[50:29] God the decree and standing on that
[50:31] statement of faith amen Jesus said if
[50:35] you have faith you will
[50:38] speak well there's no no such you know
[50:41] there's no such a thing as silently
[50:44] believing I'll say that again there's no
[50:47] such a thing as just silently believing
[50:50] amen what you believe will come
[50:53] out amen if you don't have enough
[50:55] confidence to say yet you really don't
[50:57] believe
[50:59] it that's just the it's in the word John
[51:02] Luke chapter 17 the Lord said if you
[51:04] have faith as a grain of mustard seed
[51:07] you might say to this sycamine tree be
[51:09] thou plucked up by the root and be
[51:11] planted in the sea and it should obey
[51:14] you Matthew 21 again says if you have
[51:16] faith and don't doubt if you say to this
[51:19] mountain it shall happen so according to
[51:22] Jesus for Faith to operate it must be
[51:25] released through spoken words words amen
[51:28] it must be released through spoken word
[51:30] what you speak is the evidence of your
[51:34] faith come on somebody another word of
[51:37] say another way of saying it is your
[51:39] speech reveals what you truly
[51:42] believe your speech reveals what you
[51:45] truly believe it says in 2 Corinthians 4
[51:48] it says but having the same Spirit of
[51:50] Faith according to what is written I
[51:52] believe therefore I spoke we also
[51:55] believe therefore we also o speak amen
[51:58] so if you believe you will therefore
[52:00] speak amen there will be a declaration
[52:03] it will be something a voice speaking
[52:06] against that sickness and speaking
[52:08] against that enemy and speaking against
[52:10] that doubt and speaking against that
[52:12] fear and what is not speaking your own
[52:15] thoughts or what you think ought to
[52:16] happen but what the word of God says
[52:19] therefore I can look at sickness and say
[52:21] by his stripes I am healed because it is
[52:24] a decree written by almighty God and
[52:28] given for me to
[52:32] declare Luke Luke 64 verse 4 45 says a
[52:36] good man out of the good Treasure of his
[52:39] heart bringeth forth that which is good
[52:41] and an evil man out of the evil Treasure
[52:43] of heart bringeth forth that which is
[52:45] evil for of the abundance of the heart
[52:48] his mouth
[52:49] speaketh amen he would look at the uh uh
[52:52] the Pharisees he said in Matthew 12:34
[52:55] he said oh generation of vipers how can
[52:58] you be evil speaking good things for out
[53:00] of the abundance of the heart the mouth
[53:03] speaketh a good man out of the good
[53:05] Treasure of the heart bringeth forth
[53:07] good things and the evil man out of the
[53:09] evil treasure bring forth evil things
[53:11] but I say unto you that Every Idle Word
[53:13] that a man shall speak they shall give
[53:15] an account thereof in the day of
[53:17] judgment for by thy words Thou Art
[53:19] Justified and by thy words Thou shalt be
[53:24] condemned so it was very simple teaching
[53:27] Amen in the scriptures that our words
[53:29] have power it's the whole sermon in
[53:31] itself our words have power the life and
[53:34] death in the tongue we you can either
[53:36] Speak Life or you can speak death you
[53:38] can speak your justification or you be
[53:40] justified by what you speak or you can
[53:42] be condemned by the words that you speak
[53:45] so you can look at the word at the thing
[53:47] that you're going through and if you'll
[53:49] look and speak the word of faith amen
[53:52] decree that is given there then you will
[53:54] be justified it will you will come come
[53:56] out of that thing but if you don't and
[53:58] you begin to look and all you can see
[54:00] and speak is your symptoms and and your
[54:03] problems and the situations around you
[54:05] and all the negativity around you you
[54:08] will be condemned amen why because out
[54:11] of your mouth power comes
[54:17] forth you speak what you believe in your
[54:19] heart now of course you can pretend and
[54:22] lie you know and say anything that's not
[54:25] what I'm talking about but when when you
[54:27] speak sometime you know
[54:30] people I'll just say it when you put
[54:32] your guard down and you speak
[54:34] spontaneously without thinking you will
[54:36] say what you believe in your
[54:39] heart oh yeah you'll say what you
[54:41] believe in your heart you know a lot of
[54:43] people say well I ain't got no filter
[54:45] well hey man some people need to get a
[54:47] get a think of man's
[54:50] filter amen Romans 10 ver8 say but what
[54:54] sayith that the word is n thee even in
[54:57] thy mouth and in thy heart that is the
[54:59] word of faith which we preach that if
[55:01] Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[55:03] Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thy
[55:05] heart that God has raised him from the
[55:07] dead Thou shalt be saved for with the
[55:10] heart man believeth unto righteousness
[55:13] and with the mouth confession is made
[55:15] unto
[55:17] salvation so with your mouth speaking
[55:20] amen my man heart the heart man
[55:23] believeth under righteousness and the
[55:25] mouth is conf confessing that I'm saved
[55:28] I'm delivered I I'm set free I I'm not
[55:30] bound no more I my chains are
[55:34] broke amen I I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm
[55:37] not that old man no more that's not who
[55:39] I am no more he's dead now amen you
[55:42] start declaring the decree of God and
[55:45] God brings the the power to bind that
[55:48] enemy in your
[55:54] life where is the word of faith Faith
[55:57] well we just read it it's in the heart
[55:58] and in the
[56:00] mouth for Faith to work properly it must
[56:04] come from both places when you believe
[56:06] in your heart what you believe in your
[56:08] heart must be expressed through your
[56:10] mouth for it to produce salvation means
[56:12] Deliverance so this is the way
[56:14] scriptures tell people can be delivered
[56:16] and set free believing and then speaking
[56:20] with their
[56:21] mouth amen that's why it's important
[56:24] Amen to even respond to the word of
[56:27] God that's saying you agree with it and
[56:30] it's Faith amen amen that's what what
[56:32] happened to hadie right it was her
[56:34] response that released the power if
[56:37] she'd have sat there like a bump on the
[56:39] log and said well that's a pretty good
[56:40] story man that's quite quite quite Grand
[56:43] but that's not her attitude she was
[56:44] listening she believed this man's a
[56:47] Prophet this man has thus sayth the Lord
[56:50] and he's not going to lie to me and
[56:52] she's sitting there and she hears this
[56:54] amazing story of squirrel World being
[56:57] created listen if you don't believe that
[56:59] you might as well not even believe in
[57:00] God cuz God can do the impossible God is
[57:03] still the Creator he's still the same
[57:06] yesterday today and forever he can still
[57:08] provide when there ain't no
[57:10] Provisions he can still heal when there
[57:12] ain't nothing but sickness around you he
[57:14] can still do impossible things amen if
[57:17] we can believe and here she is this is
[57:20] nothing but the
[57:23] truth and it costs God to move on her
[57:26] behalf what did what she spoke out of
[57:29] her
[57:32] mouth come on somebody we want God to do
[57:36] things we want God to move and we just
[57:37] sit there and just watch it all we ain't
[57:39] we ain't we ain't here to be
[57:41] bystanders sitting on the sidelines what
[57:44] will be will be I tell you no sir we are
[57:47] to put the word of God in our mouth
[57:50] speak against that
[57:52] enemy not what I think but what God has
[57:55] said
[57:56] God has said he shall and Satan shall be
[57:59] bruised under your feet God spoke
[58:05] that what do you
[58:08] say in Matthew 16 and verse 13 Jesus is
[58:12] with the disciples and he asked the
[58:15] question whom whom does men say that I
[58:17] am I the son of man am and they said
[58:19] well some say you know John the Baptist
[58:23] some Elias some jeremi I one or one of
[58:27] the
[58:27] prophets that's okay good but who do you
[58:32] say that I
[58:35] am and Simon Peter answered said Thou
[58:38] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[58:41] and now notice his response and what
[58:42] comes from the response blessed art thou
[58:46] Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood is
[58:48] not revealed this unto thee but my
[58:50] Father which is in heaven that thou art
[58:52] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[58:55] church and the gates of hell shall not
[58:56] Prevail against it and now we know the
[58:59] Catholic teaching is that that's Peter
[59:00] that the church is built on but the rock
[59:03] is the rock of
[59:04] Revelation and he heard and he spoke and
[59:07] from that Revelation came amen as he
[59:09] spoke the word of God came this I will
[59:11] give to thee the Keys of the Kingdom of
[59:14] Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on
[59:16] Earth shall be bound in heaven and
[59:18] whatsoever thou loose on Earth shall be
[59:20] loosed in heaven Faith spoke and power
[59:23] was
[59:24] released amen Faith the Creed and power
[59:28] was loosed to bind and to
[59:35] loose listen God's not interested in who
[59:38] what you think everybody else thinks
[59:39] about
[59:41] him God's not interested in what you
[59:43] think everybody else thinks about this
[59:45] service tonight God's interested in what
[59:48] you
[59:50] think he's wantan to know what do you
[59:52] say who do you say that I am who who
[59:56] well I tell you I he's he's God I saw
[59:59] him I saw in Sister Lanta man she test
[1:00:01] she got a great testimony that's
[1:00:02] wonderful we we tell it all the time it
[1:00:04] is a great testimony but God wants to
[1:00:06] know what you say about
[1:00:08] him not what sister at Lanta says about
[1:00:11] him or sister so and so or brother so
[1:00:13] and so or whoever he wants to know what
[1:00:15] do you who do you say that I am well I
[1:00:18] tell you this is just a B I tell you
[1:00:20] what you are you're just you're just a
[1:00:22] bunch of church work up that's what you

[1:04:16] the supreme authority that Jesus Christ
[1:04:19] is given to every Prophet no that ain't
[1:04:22] what he
[1:04:24] said he said the the supreme authority
[1:04:28] Jesus Christ has given to every
[1:04:33] believer how many Believers we
[1:04:36] got the supreme authority Jesus Christ
[1:04:40] has given to every believer anything you

[1:06:53] what them disciples should have done if
[1:06:55] they saw him sleeping they should have
[1:06:57] been
[1:07:00] sleeping he said let's go to the other
[1:07:03] side you know what he does goes back
[1:07:06] there and lays down and goes to

[1:07:38] he makes the wave this is what bounds me
[1:07:40] he makes the waves and everything
[1:07:43] cease and they Marvel and they're afraid
[1:07:46] and they're like are you kidding me how
[1:07:48] do what kind of man is this well he's

[1:07:55] the eyes they witnessing all kind of
[1:07:56] Miracles that taking place water in the
[1:07:58] wine all kinds of
[1:08:06] things we don't understand the authority
[1:08:09] we have to use the word the
[1:08:13] rest to have peace in our
[1:08:16] lives to not get so stirred up brother
[1:08:19] Tim been on that I I'm not trying just
[1:08:21] part of this
[1:08:27] well I
[1:08:30] will I mean that that was that was I
[1:08:32] tell you I think about that all the time

[1:08:49] dream dad had this ain't good
[1:08:57] just being open and honest right now

[1:09:02] church then Sunday he comes and says it
[1:09:04] ain't about resting and I and I'd been
[1:09:06] actually thinking some of those things
[1:09:07] but I I thought well he just he still
[1:09:09] needs it I don't care he needs it you
[1:09:12] know brother Brown talks about it said
[1:09:13] ain't rested at a seashore and all that
[1:09:16] I mean all that listen you can take a
[1:09:18] hundred
[1:09:19] vacations and still come back War slap
[1:09:22] out worried and fretting and carrying on
[1:09:26] how many times have you ever come home
[1:09:27] from a vacation wanting to go back on
[1:09:29] needing a vacation from your vacation
[1:09:32] wore out and tore up and you come back
[1:09:34] and it's still reality still know this
[1:09:36] and know that and this going on that's
[1:09:38] happening and you're still all tore up
[1:09:40] but if you can get to the place of true
[1:09:45] rest this is what a Believer has at
[1:09:47] their fingertips true rest when you see
[1:09:51] Darkness around you rest
[1:09:55] amen when you see all the people tore up
[1:09:58] and and ships on the coast and and all
[1:10:01] of this stuff going on and you know it's
[1:10:03] about to happen just rest you know why I
[1:10:05] can rest cuz he promised there's a body
[1:10:08] change coming it's a decree it ain't my
[1:10:11] decree I didn't say it I ain't made it
[1:10:13] up God said it and the same God who fed
[1:10:16] the 5,000 the same God who healed the
[1:10:18] lame the same God that made the lame
[1:10:21] walk and the blind SE the same one that
[1:10:23] come in this generation and the declare
[1:10:26] I am here it's the same God that's going
[1:10:29] to change these bodies one
[1:10:32] morning I can't make it
[1:10:35] happen but I can rest in his
[1:10:42] word which has he asked a question which
[1:10:45] has the greatest Authority an angel from
[1:10:48] heaven or an angel in the pull pit the
[1:10:50] angel at the pull
[1:10:53] pit Direct quote Paul said if an angel
[1:10:56] from heaven comes and preaches any other
[1:10:58] gospel to you than this which I've
[1:11:00] already preached let him be a
[1:11:03] cursed so the angel Anointed with the
[1:11:06] Holy Spirit and the word stands next to
[1:11:07] God that's right in heaven his authority
[1:11:10] all powers in Heaven and Earth is given
[1:11:11] to my hand go and I'll go with you
[1:11:14] whatsoever you bind on Earth I will bind
[1:11:15] in heaven whatsoever you loose on Earth
[1:11:18] I will Loos in heaven and notice how he
[1:11:20] goes he said if the great holy church
[1:11:22] only realized its power to do this these
[1:11:26] things and notice they didn't just leave
[1:11:28] it with the
[1:11:29] clergy amen but if the great holy church
[1:11:32] only realized his power to do these
[1:11:34] things there's no such there would be no
[1:11:37] not so but there's so much doubt and
[1:11:39] fear and trembling wondering if it will
[1:11:41] could it happen as long as that exists
[1:11:44] the church will never stand
[1:11:47] upright and when every talk of fear is
[1:11:50] vanished and the Holy Spirit is in
[1:11:52] complete control of the church then all
[1:11:54] fears are gone and that P church has the
[1:11:57] poy why they have everything that heaven
[1:12:00] owns behind
[1:12:02] them oh Jesus help me help me behave
[1:12:06] they have everything that heaven Bel
[1:12:08] owns behind them all power that heaven
[1:12:11] has is behind them why because they are
[1:12:14] ambassadors of the throne an ambassador
[1:12:17] of Christ has the authority and
[1:12:18] everything that Christ owned belonged to
[1:12:20] that Ambassador he said go ye into the
[1:12:23] world you are my Witnesses after the
[1:12:24] Holy Ghost has come upon you and what is
[1:12:26] a witness it is an ambassador it is to
[1:12:29] come and witness something the whole the
[1:12:31] whole powers of Heaven is right in your
[1:12:34] hands that's
[1:12:38] right he said the church is baring we
[1:12:42] just sit
[1:12:43] dormant it's because we don't recognize
[1:12:46] these
[1:12:51] things well I'm going to tell you right
[1:12:53] now if I was a dis disciple I'd know who
[1:12:56] he you'd be just like those disciples
[1:12:58] were CU you're doing the same thing now
[1:13:00] we don't really truly recognize what God
[1:13:03] has done among
[1:13:06] us who we got in our
[1:13:12] boat you know who's in our boat the one
[1:13:15] that heals
[1:13:18] cancer the one that could create
[1:13:20] eyeballs ask you what color you want
[1:13:27] amen The God Who can multiply amen the
[1:13:30] fishes and the loaves create squirrels
[1:13:33] amen save children that's who's in our
[1:13:37] boat this message amen we we haven't
[1:13:40] went off without
[1:13:42] Jesus I mean you can you can study it
[1:13:45] brother brother Tims went over about the
[1:13:46] two stories of one that he came walking
[1:13:49] to him one that he was in the boat some
[1:13:52] went off without him he said but some
[1:13:54] went with him but just just forgot who
[1:13:55] he
[1:13:57] was he's with
[1:13:59] us he's around us he's moving Among Us
[1:14:03] God help us to
[1:14:04] recognize who you are in this
[1:14:07] day oh it's easy to recognize him back
[1:14:10] 60 years ago or 2,000 years
[1:14:14] ago some of you probably watched The
[1:14:17] Chosen and laughed at the disciples like
[1:14:19] how could they be that
[1:14:20] blind Meanwhile we're suffering with our
[1:14:23] own blindness
[1:14:28] Christ is the head of the body wherever
[1:14:31] the head is the body's with it wherever
[1:14:33] My head goes it my body's with it where
[1:14:35] Jesus is the church is with him he don't
[1:14:38] get out of his word he stays in his word
[1:14:40] he watches over to make sure it comes to
[1:14:42] pass his church is with him and look
[1:14:44] what you say with brother brandom I'm
[1:14:46] the least one that's the souls of his
[1:14:47] feet but remember he triumphed with you
[1:14:50] he triumphed with you over every bit of
[1:14:53] it even The Souls of his
[1:14:57] feet even The Souls of his feet you
[1:14:59] might feel insignificant tonight you
[1:15:02] might feel like you're the least on the
[1:15:03] totem pole and you're the last of the
[1:15:05] last of the last every
[1:15:08] sickness every devil even death itself
[1:15:12] is under
[1:15:14] you amen even death itself is under you
[1:15:18] you say well I don't feel like I've got
[1:15:20] all of that but it's the
[1:15:22] truth it's a decree and when he put his
[1:15:25] foot down if you're the bottom of his
[1:15:28] foot every devil is under
[1:15:31] you Hallelujah I say God put your foot
[1:15:34] down tonight put it down on cancer put
[1:15:37] it down on diseases Among Us put it down
[1:15:40] on family issue put it down on what's
[1:15:42] holding our children put it
[1:15:45] [Applause]
[1:15:51] down you said brother BR might have no
[1:15:54] power he said neither do I well I'm a
[1:15:56] weakly so am
[1:15:58] I but I'm not dependent on my
[1:16:01] strength it ain't my
[1:16:04] strength I'm depending on my authority
[1:16:07] that's been given
[1:16:08] me I'm not
[1:16:10] strong I'm he's strong I'm his talks
[1:16:14] about the policeman's you know cars
[1:16:17] running up down Louisville Highway zoom
[1:16:19] zoom zoom 60 M hour and he ain't got
[1:16:22] nothing he's a little old bitty guy
[1:16:24] might be
[1:16:25] you know what he say 10 and something
[1:16:27] pounds soaking
[1:16:29] wet he said but there's enough power to
[1:16:33] stop every car why because of the
[1:16:36] authority that's been given
[1:16:38] him it ain't his power it ain't what he
[1:16:41] can do if he stepped out there it would
[1:16:43] demolish him but let him raise his hand
[1:16:45] under and be being dressed in that power
[1:16:48] and that Authority with that badge every
[1:16:51] driver recognizes that uniform brother
[1:16:53] they recognize it breaks look it's his
[1:16:55] authority why because the whole system
[1:16:58] of the city is behind him the law
[1:17:00] enforcement is behind him the mayor is
[1:17:02] behind him now that was 60 years ago it
[1:17:04] ain't so anymore seems
[1:17:06] like but what that's what the devil's
[1:17:08] doing he's trying to pollute things he's
[1:17:11] the natural look at it look at it now
[1:17:13] you can't even use that quote well let
[1:17:14] me tell you something devil God's still
[1:17:16] behind
[1:17:18] us he ain't no fickle mayor fickle Town
[1:17:22] counsel that'll turn with every kind of
[1:17:24] thing that wants to blow through a town
[1:17:26] and every kind of thought that the devil
[1:17:29] can put forth he ain't he ain't bwing
[1:17:31] down to know that devil every Power in

[1:18:14] Devils they healed the py the lame man
[1:18:18] walked people were giv back their
[1:18:21] families and families were restored amen
[1:18:23] why because of the power that was in the
[1:18:25] church that power is still in the church
[1:18:29] it has been restored in this hour that
[1:18:31] we're living in we have the same

[1:18:35] same power to use that they have we have
[1:18:39] the same blood we have every Power Of

[1:23:31] torment and pain and Jesus well I'll
[1:23:34] come and heal
[1:23:36] him Centurion replied and said Lord I'm
[1:23:40] not worthy to have you come under my
[1:23:42] roof but only say the word my servant
[1:23:46] will be healed for I am a man subject to
[1:23:49] authority of higher rank with soldiers
[1:23:52] subject to me say go and he goes come
[1:23:54] come and he comes to my slave do this
[1:23:56] and he does it when Jesus heard this he
[1:24:00] was amazed and said to those which were
[1:24:02] follow I truthfully tell you I have not
[1:24:05] found such great faith as this with
[1:24:08] anyone in Israel I say to you many
[1:24:11] Gentiles will come from the East and the
[1:24:13] west and will sit down and feast at the
[1:24:16] table and enjoy God's promises with
[1:24:20] Abraham Isaac Jacob in the Kingdom of
[1:24:23] Heaven because they accepted me as their
[1:24:29] savior I think that was a
[1:24:32] decree I'm I'm 100% sure that was a
[1:24:35] decree red letter check red red letter
[1:24:38] words again I'm not saying black letter
[1:24:40] words ain't but just understand what I'm
[1:24:44] saying I say to you that many Gentiles
[1:24:49] will
[1:24:51] come from east and west and the South
[1:24:55] and the North and will sit down and
[1:24:59] feast at the table and enjoy God's
[1:25:04] promises Hallelujah with Abraham and
[1:25:07] Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:25:10] because they accept me as their
[1:25:14] savior while the sons and hirs of the
[1:25:17] Kingdom the descendants of Abraham who
[1:25:19] will not recognize me as Messiah will be
[1:25:21] thrown into the outer Darkness into that
[1:25:23] place which which is farthest removed
[1:25:25] from the kingdom and there will be
[1:25:27] weeping and sorrow and pain and grinding
[1:25:29] of teeth and distress and anger and
[1:25:32] Jesus said to the Centurion
[1:25:34] go and it will be done for you as you
[1:25:37] have
[1:25:41] believed now I'm just going to say it
[1:25:43] because I I was studying this The Chosen
[1:25:45] just put that out and I thought they did
[1:25:47] a really good job at it that man heard
[1:25:49] them words and he went prepared for a
[1:25:52] party he started buying gifts buying
[1:25:55] food he went home he blowed out all the
[1:25:58] scandals to his
[1:26:00] gods and his wife comes running says oh
[1:26:04] you you ought to heard what's happening
[1:26:05] he said I already
[1:26:09] know hallelujah amen if there can be
[1:26:12] faith of that kind of man tonight that I
[1:26:15] say I already know what he said what he
[1:26:18] said is going to happen what he said is
[1:26:20] going to be and what he said is already
[1:26:22] done it doesn't matter matter what goes
[1:26:24] on in here and there and there I'm
[1:26:26] preparing for a party of Victory I'm
[1:26:29] preparing Amen to shout and give God
[1:26:32] praise cuz I know it's already
[1:26:38] finished it doesn't matter what I see
[1:26:40] around me it doesn't matter what anybody
[1:26:43] else says it only matters what he has
[1:26:50] said too many are listening to Satan's
[1:26:53] lies
[1:26:54] and he's putting them as decrees over
[1:26:56] their life and they're not decrees
[1:26:59] unless you allow them to be
[1:27:02] so hello somebody because his words is
[1:27:06] not thus sayith the
[1:27:08] Lord there's thus saith
[1:27:11] Satan and he is a liar and the prince of
[1:27:17] liars matter of fact what he says to you
[1:27:20] you might as well take exactly
[1:27:22] opposite if he say you're not Overcomer
[1:27:25] that's probably meaning you're whooping
[1:27:26] his tail all over the
[1:27:30] place if he's telling you that you're
[1:27:32] still sick and you're worse and you'll
[1:27:34] never get well that's probably because
[1:27:36] he already knows it's
[1:27:37] done it's finished but he's trying to
[1:27:41] get you to believe his lie but if you'll
[1:27:43] cast that down and realize that's not a
[1:27:45] decree because that is not given by
[1:27:48] somebody that has authority over
[1:27:51] me he has lost all of his Authority he
[1:27:55] has lost all of his ability he has no
[1:27:58] rights he's nothing but a
[1:28:03] bluff he said I like the attitude of the
[1:28:05] Centurion he was a man that felt
[1:28:08] unworthy he said as long as you feel
[1:28:10] Unworthy of a blessing you're asking
[1:28:12] you're pretty apt to get it he said but
[1:28:14] when you get to the place where you
[1:28:16] think that God owes it to you that's
[1:28:18] when you're mistaken we're in debt to
[1:28:20] God not God in debt to us we're indebted
[1:28:23] to God
[1:28:25] this Roman Italian whatever he was he
[1:28:27] said Lord I'm not worthy for you to come
[1:28:29] under my roof neither thought I worthy
[1:28:31] to come face you in other words I sent
[1:28:33] your church to meet you and ask you
[1:28:35] these questions but I have faith I know
[1:28:37] that you're a man of Authority for I'm a
[1:28:38] I'm a man of authority I speak in his
[1:28:41] son I say to this one he goes this one
[1:28:42] he stays whatever he said I'm a man that
[1:28:44] can say these things you go do it it
[1:28:46] happens and he knew that that was a Son
[1:28:48] of God and that every sickness and every
[1:28:51] demon was under him and all all he had
[1:28:54] to do is speak the word not pray speak
[1:28:57] the
[1:28:58] word that's all and it would be done
[1:29:01] because every demon would have to obey
[1:29:04] him do you believe that
[1:29:06] tonight how many believes
[1:29:08] that every
[1:29:11] demon will obey God it has to how many
[1:29:15] believe that tonight everything obeys
[1:29:18] God how many believes that tonight and
[1:29:21] everything will obey you if you have
[1:29:23] faith
[1:29:30] wow finishing this
[1:29:33] thought he would come and he would speak
[1:29:36] on the restoration of the Bride tree and
[1:29:38] he' talk about restoration means to
[1:29:40] bring back to restore the claim a claim
[1:29:43] can be enforced and bring back to his
[1:29:46] rightful owner where it
[1:29:47] belongs some way it went away from
[1:29:50] somehow it went away from the rightful
[1:29:51] owner and can wander around but to
[1:29:53] restore for is to bring it back to who
[1:29:55] it really owns it and bring it back to
[1:29:58] its right estate where it was at the
[1:30:01] first time bring it back to its right
[1:30:04] condition in order to do this we have to
[1:30:06] have we have the right to enforce if
[1:30:08] there's a law to enforce the rightful
[1:30:11] condition of restoration to restore like
[1:30:13] if somebody stole property and they're
[1:30:14] holding property captive when you take
[1:30:16] the law and go to this person and the
[1:30:18] law will enforce this person to restore
[1:30:20] this property back to his natural owner
[1:30:22] you notice how the devil was doing I've
[1:30:25] said it before like talking about the
[1:30:26] police now he's giving squatters more
[1:30:28] rights than people actually own the
[1:30:30] place in the natural so if it's happened
[1:30:32] in the natural you know he's trying to
[1:30:34] do it in the
[1:30:35] spiritual well you got to you can't just
[1:30:37] kick anybody out you and you have the pl
[1:30:39] you have the deed to the place you have
[1:30:41] the rights to the place and these people
[1:30:42] ain't got no rights they're just sitting
[1:30:44] there on what's rightfully yours and in
[1:30:46] this time and place that we're living in
[1:30:48] in some places getting to be more and
[1:30:49] more you go there and you cannot kick
[1:30:52] them out the law cannot make them
[1:30:54] move that's amazing and the devil wants
[1:30:57] to come in the time that we're living in
[1:30:59] and say he don't have to
[1:31:02] move he wants to sit there on a
[1:31:04] god-given
[1:31:06] right a god-given decree I listen your
[1:31:10] healing is god-given
[1:31:12] it's a god-given
[1:31:15] right because it's a god-given
[1:31:18] decree amen your deliverance and your
[1:31:21] salvation is a god-given right
[1:31:29] enforce it we have the privilege to
[1:31:32] enforce upon Satan the claims that God
[1:31:35] give us for God has a
[1:31:39] law yeah he has a law and his word is
[1:31:42] the law and God and His word made
[1:31:44] certain claims to the church therefore
[1:31:46] we have a right to force these claims
[1:31:48] upon Satan and say give it back give it
[1:31:52] back he has to do it because can't take
[1:31:54] God's agent the Holy Spirit and go right
[1:31:57] down on our knees and say this thus
[1:31:58] sayith the Lord he's got to give it up
[1:32:01] because the holy spirit's there to make
[1:32:02] him do it the law of the land is to
[1:32:04] enforce Is by The Land by the law of the
[1:32:07] the law of the spirit of God is to force
[1:32:09] Satan to give back what he unrightfully
[1:32:12] deceitfully taken from us by and and
[1:32:15] Souls of men he took and Souls of women
[1:32:18] and
[1:32:20] children hello
[1:32:22] somebody May by unrightfully and
[1:32:26] deceitfully taken from God Souls of men
[1:32:29] he took Souls of women and
[1:32:32] children sickness of the body he's
[1:32:35] placed upon people where God made them
[1:32:37] in the image to be like him and the
[1:32:39] church has given the rightful legal
[1:32:41] rights by the Bible to take the Holy
[1:32:44] Spirit and to enforce this claim upon
[1:32:47] their
[1:32:48] rights I believe I just quoted he said
[1:32:50] in the last meeting not sure but a
[1:32:52] brother from Louisville Come and Talk
[1:32:53] talks about the stolen car where they
[1:32:55] had come and the man had stole it big
[1:32:57] racket that was going on stealing cars
[1:32:58] and they're still doing that today
[1:33:00] painting them and such and so they were
[1:33:02] having a terrible time and we got down
[1:33:04] on our knees now Jesus wouldn't have had
[1:33:06] to do that for he was the word now we're
[1:33:10] not the word so we get down on our
[1:33:13] knees he said the word of the Lord came
[1:33:15] to the prophets and they wasn't the word
[1:33:17] but the word came to them but Jesus was
[1:33:19] the word you see he didn't have to pray
[1:33:21] he was God himself but we are His
[1:33:22] prophets his servants who the word of
[1:33:24] the Lord comes to and we pray and we had
[1:33:26] scripture where Jesus said whatsoever
[1:33:28] two or three two or more gathered in my
[1:33:30] name they agree I'll be in their midst
[1:33:32] and if they agree touching any certain
[1:33:34] thing and ask and don't doubt it shall
[1:33:36] be given what they ask amen what was he
[1:33:38] doing he was invoking the
[1:33:40] decree amen and here they were this man
[1:33:43] had unrightfully taking what was his not
[1:33:46] his and taking this brother's car we got
[1:33:48] on our knees about five men together
[1:33:49] four or five we nailed down and I
[1:33:51] pleaded this case before God and I took
[1:33:54] the Word of Promise and I sent it
[1:33:59] forth Hallelujah I sent it forth and
[1:34:03] that great Holy Spirit as he took the
[1:34:05] word to serve the summons a vision broke
[1:34:08] and I saw a man going toward Bowling
[1:34:10] Green Kentucky with a yellow shirt on
[1:34:11] driving this truck and the Holy Spirit
[1:34:13] came upon Him condemned him for what he'
[1:34:16] done and he turned he was about halfway
[1:34:17] and he turned around and I saw him come
[1:34:20] back and park that car on a certain
[1:34:21] street over the river there and I raised
[1:34:23] up and said told the brother that thus
[1:34:25] sayith the Lord and when they started
[1:34:27] out they went on the road and there was
[1:34:29] sitting there half empty with gasoline
[1:34:31] with a tank half 50 where had been
[1:34:32] filled up just enough to take him
[1:34:34] halfway to Bowling Green and bring it
[1:34:36] back these men are sitting right here
[1:34:37] this morning as a witness what was it in
[1:34:40] forcing giving it
[1:34:43] back what was God doing he he ain't
[1:34:46] necessarily I mean yeah he's concerned
[1:34:48] about everything in our life and he's
[1:34:50] concerned somebody stole our car yes but
[1:34:52] he's more concerned about your
[1:34:55] children that car has no Eternal value
[1:34:58] that car is going to one day probably
[1:35:00] even a day you can't even find a scrap
[1:35:02] of it it's probably gone by now it might
[1:35:04] be might be an antique somebody's got
[1:35:06] sitting on the shower room but one day
[1:35:08] it's going to be
[1:35:10] gone but God would return that back he
[1:35:14] was showing if I can do that I'll bring
[1:35:17] you children back
[1:35:25] let me tell you vision's broke
[1:35:29] tonight amen there's children that's
[1:35:31] being held unrightfully the devil has
[1:35:34] deceitfully deceived them and they're
[1:35:37] sitting in places they don't
[1:35:39] belong but if we'll grab this cup full
[1:35:42] of blessings and just send them
[1:35:44] forth and pray tonight God you see our
[1:35:48] children you see the prodical we ask
[1:35:51] Lord that you bring them back in the
[1:35:52] name of Jesus

[1:35:59] barroom or they out on the floor drunk
[1:36:01] are they out there doped up are they
[1:36:03] just out so far out they don't even
[1:36:05] believe in God no more and they might be
[1:36:07] a good citizen but they have totally
[1:36:09] walked away from God there is a power
[1:36:12] that is strong enough there is an
[1:36:14] enforcer in this building that has a
[1:36:16] right if somebody say hey devil turn my
