place visit them with a special anointing cause the hearts of your children to rise in faith until it becomes a Rapture in faith I ask it in Jesus name as we read the word Lord bless it to our hearts in Jesus name amen amen God bless you if you will will you please turn with me to Luke 17 and verse 5 we so appreciated all the wonderful music today a little bit of technical difficulties but hey when you have man-made things it it breaks down problems come with technical things but we pray press on amen amen appreciate brother Timothy just pressing on brother Tim all the different ones the singers the worship is just is so vital so important you know before um a great battle God sent them out with singers to sing and worship God and and I I believe that every service is a battle amen it's a battle between wisdom and versus Faith it's part of the greatest battles ever fought maybe some of you today are are really needing a win in your life a victory and I pray that today will be a victory for you and your life and for your heart amen thanks be to God Amen did I see sister Phyllis here today she's here today well God bless her amen so nice to have her in the service brother Roger also good to see you today been a long time since he's been here but you know he's persevering and had some situations his wife's health and so on like that but you know um we go sometimes through many deep trials and troubles and whatever but God always brings us through sometimes we don't see how we don't see the path but we know he'll do it amen he's never failed us amen nice to have these folks down here from mid Louisiana Jonesville area God bless you to have you in this service together with us today each one of you amen Home Folks amen it's always good to see you Zachary welcome home son amen so Nathaniel I meant um Zachary don't you go nowhere amen so you know we're just happy to be in the presence of the Lord today and ask that God will just speak to you in a in a special way Luke chap 175 and and the apostles said said unto the Lord increase our faith how many would like your faith increased amen I I pray that it'll be until it actually becomes rapturing Faith amen and the Lord said if you had Faith as a grain of mustard seed you might say to this sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you amen what powerful words from our savior this morning amen God bless you can be seated I'm must to be speaking on the mountain movers connected to the Dynamo amen you know we've been discovering in some of the services I preached all in the last few weeks of how the disciples struggled with doubt and when they were confronted by that stubborn demon that would not obey their commands and Jesus would tell them it was simply because of their unbelief there was no nothing wrong with the word there was nothing wrong with the promise of God and for those of you that have been here you know I'm referring to where the disciples tried to deliver a demonic child a child that had a demon rather and and um this Spirit would throw it in Into the Fire and tried to destroy its life and and uh you know the father wanted it delivered and brought it to his disciples and as he said they couldn't cure him and of course Jesus found them uh confronted by a crowd you know that was uh around and and no doubt um with the crowd uh uh there was a lot of unbelief there and as they begin to scream out their their questions and questioning the disciples and we we saw and know their faith just kind of wilted where um they began to listen to the questioning of of unbelief and and of course um you know Jesus after delivering the boy he would he would um be asked the disciples why couldn't we deliver him why why couldn't we cast out this devil and and again as we look at it we believe and and know that Satan anointed the crowd with unbelief their arguments against the power of God and it just caused the disciples Faith to wilt in front of the challenge and of course listening to the crowd today will will cause Faith to turn to doubt because the crowd I'm talking about these words were in that day were they were they were um the people of Jehovah they should have believed the crowd had many examples of healings and deliverances and you know of God provision and and the dead being raised and the Red Sea open and all kinds of things they had every reason in the world to believe but here they comes with questions and with doubt and and these voices from the crowd they begin to say things like you know healing and miracles are only for a certain season this would only be when Elijah was here this was only could happen when Moses was here and we're just simply not in that season you know there and of course that's just a disguise way of saying that the days of Miracles are passed and the apostolic age is over you know many times people will hear of the Rev Revival that we have and and we do have a Revival it's the bride's Revival and and as I've said but we didn't start it it came because of the opening of The Seven Seals and the mysteries of God being revealed in this day and and it has caused a Revival and a and a restoration back to the word of God again and and so you but many will hear they will they will hear of Revival and they will say oh that's that's just a season your church is going through it's just a a time you know you know I I've been through these cycles and and it's just ups and downs and in and out and and so there always comes doubt as to saying why we can't have Revival why we can't have the moving of the spirit or or it's just going to blow away or it's going to it's the the fire will burn out well I'll tell you what I mean I've been preaching for 50s something years and I ain't burned down yet and I ain't planning on burning out amen say I had a group of ministers call me up one time and said brother Tim we need you for a seminar and we would like you to speak on preacher burnout I said I don't know what it means I have never burned out and I ain't going to burn out there's a fire burning on the inside of me it it sits down a little low I just put more of the word of God on it amen so you see it's a fire as Jeremiah said I I would hold it back but I can't hold it back because it's a fire shut up in my bones and that's the way that it ought to be with every child of God a Revival that'll last you all the way to the [Applause] rapture we don't have to be up and down and in and out just because of trials and tribulations and seasons and times and and all of that we can we can have a a constant life with Christ Living every day in the holiest of holies in the presence of the Shina Glory eating of the Mana that never never goes stale or runs out the voice of accusation from the crowd shouts but you should not seek signs well that's a true statement it's often used as excuse why there are not signs following the Believers and while this B is frothing on the ground and under you know here he is under the power of the devil the crowd is screaming all he needs is the word because that which is perfect has come and we got the perfect word that's all you need you know we we don't need gifts of the Spirit that that was for a different season because now we have the full words and all such gifts as healings and workings of Miracles and prophecy are not pass and obsolete so just give him the word you know read a scripture send him a quote well you know that's just another way of saying the days of Miracles are passed because really it's an excuse for the crowd as to why God is no longer among us it keeps them from having to do some soul searching it excuses their leot to see and lukewarm condition of being rich increased with goods and God I really don't need you we got it all but I just I just want you to know when we when we have the true word there's a power with it now there was a reason for these disciples not having perfect faith and of course we know Jesus said it's because of unbelief but there's something else that we want to see in this and I take this from the message perfect faith brother brandom said at first the disciples did not have this perfect faith they didn't have it because they had Christ walking with them but then afterward Christ was in them and so he said it's hard then to have this perfect faith without the Holy Spirit it has to bring it it does and so let me just interject something there anyone with the Holy Ghost can have perfect Faith now I heard of a great theologian one time that that read the book perfect faith and he made the conclusion it was only for the prophet but I'm telling you this morning that anyone with the Holy Spirit can have perfect Faith now you as as I finished the quotation he said you say the disciples didn't have perfect Faith No they had an epileptic child there they were trying to cast this devil out of and they couldn't do it the father seen Jesus com and said we brought my son to your disciples and they should could not cure him you know I I think it's a crime I think it's a shame when when men and women sit in our church Bound by demons some of them as lost as lost can be and yet no hope giving no opportunity for real deliverance and salvation as I said that over and again one of the most principal things of the church should be to cast out devils you know Healing The Sick is casting out Devils amen it's delivering it's dealing with the spirit notice notice and and the disciples asked Jesus why couldn't we hear him and he said because of the lack of your faith of your unbelief now he said remember they had the power we're going to talk about this morning because we have the power and they had the power Jesus had given them the power well you can't get a higher authority than that amen if a if a prophet put his manle on you that's pretty good but Jesus had given them this Authority and he had given them power to heal the sick raise the Dead cast out Devils just few days before that they had the power but not the faith to use the power and brother brandham said now there's the brandham Tabernacle there's the church the bride today the holy spirit is here with the power but you haven't got that Faith to move it see what I mean it takes Faith to move it now Denny I shared this quote with you as I continue reading it a couple of weeks ago but bring it for your remember he he gives an example of the Dy Dynamo and he says here I've got a shell in my pocket and I hand loaded it I know what it'll do by the ballistics like the word but I got to fire the gun the fire has to get to the powder the powder's got to get got the power but it has to have the fire to light it off and the same thing the powders in the Shell but it needs the faith to charge it and throw it out and that's what it takes his perfect Faith to ignite the power of the Holy Spirit which we now have which we have now since he's come upon us Faith to ignite to see great things so now we need Faith to ignite the power in the word now let me just say because sometimes we get criticized because we get happy and we shout amen well even even in heaven when the book was open the lamb took the book everything in heaven rejoiced so if we know the book is open it ought to make us rejoice but I I just want to say hey you know it's not just screaming and shouting you know I imagine that the disciples screamed and jumped and shouted and there's nothing wrong with that there is a place for that in our worship amen there but it that never moved the devil you you don't shout to get the power but if you have the power it'll make you shout sometimes we get criticized for blowing things out of the whistle but at least there's a fire enough to blow it out the whistle amen and there was a Baptist man who came to brother brandom and he was Desiring God he said I've got all of these these um diplomas that are and certificates that's on my wall where you know I've been seeking for God and each one of them accomplishment and receiving a a diploma for and he says I'm still missing God in my life and he says so brother brandom said I understand you've turned Pentecostal I'm a Baptist and you've turned Pentecostal he said no I just received the Pentecostal blessing I'm not the Pentecostal denomination the Pentecostal blessing you said well I've been to their meetings and they kick over the chairs and throw a book through the window said you wouldn't call that behavior the Blessed Holy Spirit brother Brandon said I I I'm still not able to judge God he said well what makes him do that and then he brings this principle that I have been bringing up and I want to bring it again this morning and he says in my travel I find two classes of people one are fundamentals positionally they know by the mechanics that they are to be sons of God and Daughters of God and the next I find the Pentecostals with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the fundamentals positionally know where they're at and they don't have any faith the word and the Pentecostal has got a lot of faith but don't know who they are it's like a man had money in the bank couldn't write a check one could write a check and had no money in the bank if if you could just get the two together and I said so it's letting off steam said I I don't think that would have to be necessary but they got to give vent somewhere and he said now if they would just take that Steam and know how to direct it fundamentally in the word the big regime of God would start moving on and then he says that's where Satan got in to make it all mechanics and no Dynamics our back all Dynamics and no mechanics we've got to put it together we've got the power of the Holy Spirit but we got to come back with the word to feed this machine we can't feed it on Creed it won't burn it it won't burn it it chokes up man cannot live by bread alone because it was made for the word of God but but every word of God out of the mouth of God so here we stand a church Commission on the last commission now he's actually in this sermon he's speaking about Samson and and how he was defeated before the enemy much much like much like this the disciples were defeated before the crowd and they couldn't cast The Devil out here again Samson is blinded and defeated and and he said Here We Stand a church commissioned on the last Commission the last thing Jesus said to his church the the the last of all Nations he that go into all the world and make the disciples to All Nations and he that believeth is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and and is a conjunction tie your sence together these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues if they take serpents up and things that not harm them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover so he said so why would we have to stand in the presence of some Heathen God and take defeat and I just want to say why would we today have to just go to some psychology to try to fix the problem amen when the real problem is a problem within the soul we cast Satan out he's no longer the King sitting on that throne amen so psychology will not do that why why are we trying other things we know what the remedy is the remedy is coming to cover with God realize the power is here and say just once more Lord like Samson did I believe there's a new crop on Earth that's going to do that but anyway like Samson and his hair grown out and a returned to the Covenant the power with faith must return there has to be those two coming together someone who can write the check who's got money in the bank now brother bradam said in it is rizon of the sun he said now there's been churches churches Brides brides churches Brides brides but there's got to come one Hallelujah there's got to come a real bride there must come one that's not not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it it makes a church live and move on in the power of his resurrection and until we come to that place what good does it do to polish the hubs now what he's talking about there he's a give an example of two cars that are going to be going down the you know they're going to try to take a trip with and both of them have just come off the line and they're both filled up with with um high octane gas and they're fuel fueled up and they're ready to go but one of them's got Dynamics one of them's got spark and the other doesn't and you know that's the deal is that it's it's a it looks like a car it is a car but there's something wrong the me the mechanics is all there the word that has power amen gasoline has all the energy stored up in it but it needs the fire and I'm telling you I believe in this today we have the full word restored the full word has come back in this last day I believe we're are church that is full of high octane power the power is there but we need spark there has to be sparked with it come on not just a cranking on a battery and chug chug chug chug CH but I'm talking about a fire in the engine that'll shove that Cadillac down the road that are drive on down to Divine Healing that a drive on down to Miracles let a drive on to a rapture we need a resurrection in this hour so what good is it just to polish the church if it won't go on somewhere what good is it just going through the form of religion and no power and that's what the Bible said a form of godliness but deny the power thereof you know that we know Jesus he was the word but he had D Dynamics to go with the word now that's the way you can tell the true word if we really got the word amen the spirit comes with it amen there there again this is what you have to look well we got the word brother okay where is the spirit the spirit has to come to the word and with that ignite it when if it's true word it's spirit and Truth now so there again as we're looking at this we know God will have a bride in this last day and she's going to be F the fulfilling of all the manifestations and revelation of all of the things that is spoke of a bride in the Bible so it can only manifest that and and if we manifest something different from the groom it ain't the bride because the two are the one she is bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh and so brother brandom said until the church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do the things he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll give him a charge of my Dynamics and his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it I'll raise him up again at the last day amen that's the Easter message the Dynamics and the mechanics together the mechanics without Dynamics no good neither is Dynamics without the mechanics you can jump and scream jump up and scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to deny this word it won't do any good you're just cranking around on the Pistons got sparked air to to fire but no gasoline to fire by it only work as they come together so one will sit still and the other will go up I I don't know what you want but I want to be in the car that goes up amen I want I want to be in the church that fires off that can move on down to the promises of God Amen now you know perfect faith is simply Faith made perfect all right it's just simply Faith come to Perfection maturity now Jesus never questioned his faith could you imagine Jesus questioning whether he had Faith or not he didn't he didn't question oh do I have the faith the disciples don't but do I you know um he didn't question whether he had Faith to stop the winds or or steal the waves or have faith to to raise Lazarus up he never questioned his faith and we should never question ours because the Bible said we live by the faith of the Son of God and as Born Again Believers God has given every one of us a Measure of Faith so you already have faith amen if you have no faith you could never please God faith is natural it is natural to a born- again believer he is Born Into Faith he is born of Faith so faith is one of the attributes of being born again amen if you don't have faith you can't please God so you can't be a Christian faith doesn't come by long drawn our prayer meetings it don't come by long fast faith comes by hearing the word preached that's why the sinner starts believing that Jesus will save him is because he hears the word preached amen and he here's that word preached that God will save to the uttermost amen and that's why anointed preaching points out what is provided in the word and Faith just AB automatically grasp that and acts on it and of course if it does act on it it's dead right cuz faith without works is dead amen so you say well I've got faith well there has to be some Works to go with it and if it doesn't have it you've got dead Faith now like Jesus Adam never wondered or questioned his faith it was born into him faith is an attribute of a child of God a child of God is born of faith and born with faith and faith is an unconscious part of your makeup as a child of God Amen I'm operating right now on unconscious thing my heart is pumping away and pumping oxygen and whatever coming through my from my lungs into my blood and going through my veins and I'm unconscious of it even happening faith is an unconscious thing it's a part of your makeup as a child of God you are a Believer Believers believe that's what they do amen so you so you know you don't think of your faith you just think of God's ability and his provision in you through the new birth you think of his faithfulness to make his word good and and accomplish what was provided for us to his atonement too many times you know you know people think of do I have faith for this is my faith strong enough but you don't you are not and and I'm even quoting brother Brandon from this and and in his um when he sent out a prayer card or sorry um a prayer ribbon there that he prayed over a handkerchief had taken from the Bible where they took um clothing or parts of clothing from from Paul and from his body and and laid it on the sick and demons fled and so you know as he sent out these prayer CLA for free and he says he put a little letter in there he says you don't think of your faith or how much you do or don't have we are not to be occupied with our feelings our symptoms or our faith or our lack of faith but only with what God Said Amen come on you know you you you go to doing what like what what would happen if David you know walked out and he said am I up to this is my aim good enough have I practiced this enough yeah you know I mean can I hit that little bitty Target there it's got a helmet on a shield and all of it can I get the right spot you see David never questioned that amen his I was on his God here comes the enemy says I'm going to throw you to the birds amen and he curses his God and he said you come to me with a sword and a spear and you're training but I come to you in the name of the Lord God hallelujah you see he came representing the god of Israel and as a Seed of Abraham he was going to conquer the enemy's gate that giant was going to fall he didn't look to see am I able to do this he looked on how big his God was not how big the problem was this is often the problem we look and see how big the problem is how big the giant is in our life rather than keeping our eyes on how big our God is now we live by faith is an unconscious faith when God tells you something you're not to think of your faith or the lack of it you just think of God's ability and his provision now what Adam lost in the fall Is Ours by the lamb taken the book we live in a very special time yes we're way on the other side you know at the end of the ages and we're right here with a where Revelation has come to us where that the lamb is taken the book and released the Revelation making known the Mysteries and open up the book and and and who did it the lamb did it and who was the lamb the man Christ Jesus so when he took the book it was a man taking the book so for the first time since Adam when Adam fell it went back in the hands of almight God but now in our day come on Jesus the man took the book for man amen and he did not just come and leave it there in the heavens but he set it down ripped off the seals sent it down to the seventh angel on Earth to reveal the Mysteries and in Revelation 10 he shows his anointing come down Christ coming down with an open book and he tells you you now you the Unworthy one who couldn't even look at the book or couldn't even take the book now go take the book and consume that book and beat the [Applause] book we're living in a a wonderful hour where God's doing Mighty things am and you are the visible part of the Unseen realm now Adam of course lost the book when he sinned by heeding his wife's reasoning instead of holding on to God's word so they took reasoning instead of the word the disciples are having an issue they're hearing from the crowd's reasoning and they put they put aside the words of Jesus I give you power over unclean spirits they put that aside and listen to the reasoning of the crowd now Adam Sinn by heeding this reasoning his wife reason with Satan produced the product to Adam Adam turn loose of the word and sold out he lost his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right to life remember the day you eat thereof that day you die and when he lost his life he lost his inheritance in life because he had Supreme control of the earth he was a god of the earth you know Eden was the extension of Heaven on Earth and his job was to take an earth that was without form and void and darkness cover it and and all kinds of of things up chaos upon the Earth and turned the whole earth into an Eden and so you know his son had this Earth under his control he could speak he could name remember even when the animals were named God brought the animals to Adam and to see what he would name them why didn't God just name him cuz God had given him dominion and and it was his place now to name every animal he could speak he could name he could he could stop nature but when sin came he lost his inheritance you see Adam could say let this mountain be moved over there and Adam could do it it would it would obey him let this tree be plucked up planted over there it would happen he had complete Supreme Court control as a minor God under God our father because he was a Son of God now when the last name is put on the book and the battle is all finished here we will come back to an earth that has been burn over and sin cleansed from it and we'll walk out on the ashes of the wicked and we with the man Christ Jesus he's God I'm not trying to take away his God godship but but with the man Christ Jesus I'm just showing you he became one of us so we could become one with him with Christ and his bride we'll restore the Earth back to an Eden again so you see right now Satan is still the prince of the power of the air and that's why there is always a conflict when we as the citizens of that Heavenly Kingdom begin to disturb his realm that's right because because by permission because of the Fall Satan has the right to inhabit people until until the moment they side with the word of God and said I don't want to live under that any longer and then Satan's Reign ends with their soul now notice Adam had Supreme control he was a minor God on the earth he was he was God upon the earth a minor God a little God he said ah brother Tim okay let's go back again cats give birth to cats dogs give birth to dogs humans give birth to humans so when you're born again and God gives birth it's not going to be a duck or a frog it's going to be another God yes sir you were predestined to be in the image of his son Jesus Christ to be just like him so now here's the question comes back around you know that there was Adam before the fall but if the blood has cleansed it back do you believe in the power of the blood we sing about it do you believe it well then the power of the blood cleanses it back look what look what happened when God took Earth that was cursed what are you talking about brother Tim I'm talking about the body of Jesus made out a cursed Earth he came the Holy Spirit overshadowed the Virgin and wrapped around him Earth that was cursed and Jesus took that cursed Earth down to the water and baptized it and there was filled with the Holy Ghost and made curse Earth I'm talking about Earth that was under a curse amen made it are you with me made it obey God so if he did that with Jesus what do you think he's going to do with you come on when he comes down into your life he'll take your cursed Earth that used to blaspheme and speak evil and all kinds of things your mouth speaking wrong things your hands doing wrong thing your feet Swift shed blood all of these things listen let me tell you when he comes in your life he'll take that curse Earth and make them hands lift up and glorify God make your lips give praise to him and Jesus took that Earth to the grave and raised it up glorified and it's no longer under the curse and one day this cursed Earth will no longer be under the cursed we're going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and be glorified cuz flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom so then what about it now Jesus controlled storms he rebuked winds and waves he removed life from a fig tree he healed the sick cast out Devils he rebuked death and a man 4 days dead lived again and then he said the works that I do shall you do also now Adam lost his inheritance to the Earth it passed from his hands back to God again Satan's dirty hands couldn't take it let me tell you Satan's only a squatter he is only there by permission what permission man's permission man sold out to Satan bought his reasoning took his lies and come the way of Mortals and because of that we all die yes sir and Adam sold his sold his faith in God to Satan's reasoning and his eternal life and his right to the tree of life and the right to the Earth that belonged to him he forfeits it all the way all the way back to Satan I mean forfeit forfeits the rights to it to the hands of Satan and and but the the title deed goes back in the hand of almighty God that's why Revelation five shows one sitting on the throne it ain't the devil he don't hold the title deed but it became a question document because man owned it and now Satan says but he sold it to me and so there comes a question on it so it is in the hands of almighty God until a man can come who is worthy to redeem it Hallelujah and there are kinsman redeemer was worthy he had the wealth amen I said he had the wealth he could pay the debt you couldn't pay amen he had the he had his blood listen listen the blood of bulls and goats not a million of them could not represent or be enough to cover one child I've done it many many times you know I use an example you know I I used to raise registered priz Nubian goats had ribbons and and trophies also had Black Angus Cattle redard Prime stock bring a little child up and ask the parents how many how many of my goats would you trade for this kid this child how many would it take 100 no 200 no a th000 no okay I got cattle I got priced cattle what about cattle I I'll you put them up how many a million two million you see you can stack them all up they wouldn't all of the animals in the world would not be the worth of one human being but then God took on Flesh and Blood amen and it wasn't an unworthy human dying for another another unworthy human that unworthy one would have to die for his own sin but here comes a sinless one and his blood is enough to cover the sin of the world blood of that one [Applause] man but the Earth right now is under the prince of the power of the air but God promises to bring man back on the throne again if you read Revelation chapter 3 in the leoan age which is the last age you will find the last age will sit with him on his throne but until until that until that the the Earth there uh you know is and and the battle here is finished we have to fight for our position as sons and remember we're going to hear from the crowd too that's right and and because of our first birth we were born defeated and under Satan's Dominion but I want to get it back to you again in our day the Lost inheritance has come back to a man again and in heaven the man Christ Jesus Took the book and now the for the forfeited title deed is back in the hands of the original owner amen that's why friends he's about to call for his bride amen he's about to wind up and finish Redemption he's already taken the steps to do it he paid for it at Calvary amen he's doing his claiming work right now when he gets the last one whose name is on the book claimed and dipped in blood he'll take that book that people to heaven there'll be change in a moment in a twinkling of an [Applause] eye Hallelujah the title deed it went back in the hands of almighty God but God had given that to Adam Adam lost it now it's being restored by the second item seals torn off handed to the seventh angel on Earth which opens the book of inheritance to us and that makes the accuser so angry it's because we who in our first birth was born to sin and were slaves we are now free born and that's a great battle every time we try to take position and use our faith is that there is a battle of wisdom or reasoning versus faith and the crowd screams at us with all of man's Wisdom to try to keep you from Dominion because they're anointed of the devil to do so and while on the other hand the word of faith it is screaming from every scripture are you with me amen it screams from every from a whole cloud of witnesses amen and and it is saying you've got Dominion come on somebody Abraham would say as a father of Faith he said if I believe God and I was under only under blood of bulls and goats how about you under the blood of Jesus Christ the true Lamb of God how much more should you [Applause] believe and it's screaming you can do it amen I walk with God says Enoch you can walk with God in an evil Day come on in the days like in there was in the days of Noah precursor to Noah's day when the the Mind man was on evil continually we're back here again we're back here again the days of Sodom gomor the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot we're back here you see because they were only foreshadowing in what would be here in the end time and so here we are in the last day but they're screaming out as a witness see this is what Paul said in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 he goes all through and he says by faith Moses by fa now listen listen it wasn't yet born into them yet they wasn't even born of faith somebody help me preach there was no new birth under the Old Testament it's only in the New Testament that there's a new birth the blood of bulls and goats could not remit sin the nature of an innocent lamb could not come back on the believer he would go and worship offer his lamb go back the same sinner that he was but not this Blood amen once this blood comes upon you the very nature of the Lamb comes on the inside of you you Hallelujah you have his life you have his nature on the inside of you you're a son you're a daughter of God redeemed Hallelujah redeemed how I love to Proclaim it Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb redeemed through his infinite Mercy his child and forever I am because there's nothing can separate me from the love of God Hallelujah he cannot deny himself so he cannot deny me as his child every child born of him is recognized by him the great battle every time we try to take position and use our faith there's this battle and it screams out at us and your success of the war depends on who and what you believe will you believe the crowd like the disciples did or will you believe the words of Jesus they say you can't he says you can he named it Pig trees s siine trees mountains whatever you say come on Amen they say you can't he says you can listen somebody's going to have to believe in the impossible in this day right I mean because that's what that's what the chain of your body is standing on your feet change in a moment the twinkling of an eye amen that's a massive Divine Healing from the top of your head to the sole of your feet that's gray hair coming back the right color blind eyes come hey you know eyes that are just an eyeball artificial in the socket coming back the right thing again well brother Tim I went to the doctor the other day in the hospital and I got a new kneecap well you can't take it to Heaven Hallelujah now notice then he gives us an abstract title deed and that abstract means it search all the way back to the beginning it's like putting a little drop of in down into bleach and it just dissipates disappears you see when sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ it gives an abstract right straight back to the Creator and you become a Son of God its Redemption means all legal possession I I want you to get this its Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve what ought it do to a born again Christian today you talk about something that out over I'm talking about the lamb a man taking the book The Christ Jesus taking the book and loosens it its seals and opening the promises back to you again taking off the Creeds and the dogmas that held it back are you with me it's Redemption means that all that was lost by Adam and Eve amen has been given back to you as a child of God amen it's it's legal possession the abstract title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost amen and that's what you when you get the Holy Ghost you get an abstract title deed that all the leans against you what your mother did your daddy did I don't care what kind of sins there was and what they did and what and what was in your family and your family tree I don't care what you did and the life you lived and how bad you lived and all of that it's all wiped away every debt of it is paid amen God gives you an abstract title deed that means he searched your title and he cleared the the leans that were against you that said you couldn't be free that you couldn't go to heaven that you had to go to hell that you were possessed by the devil let me tell you when Jesus blood came upon you it gave you an abstract title deed and cleared your deed and it cannot be [Applause] found you know every man was made to potentially become a son of God no matter how sinful he is or how far away he is he's a fallen son God's his creator his maker Jesus Paid the the price he may not ever reconcile himself to that may never accept it may may never do him any good but yet potentially he has the potential to become to become r revealed as a son now what did God put man here for he made him to have dominion you would read Genesis 1 Genesis 2 you would find he gave him dominion over the fish the seed the foul of the air now think about it for a moment after the curse after the fall he would have to do things by the sweat of the brow so before the fall he did things just like Jesus the second Adam did he said to the Fig Tree he spoke to the winds and waves he controlled nature he controlled the Earth he brought God's peace upon the Earth the lion would lay down by the lamb you see so he was made to have dominion well brother Tim that's great one day we're going to have it we'll be there well let me tell you let me tell you a little in on Little Secret when you're born again as a son or daughter of God you were made to have dominion too in fact of the matter is well brother Tim we we we got to sin every day uh sin shall not have dominion over you well we can't live sin has no more rule over you there is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of spirit and life have made you free from the law of sin and death so he made Adam to have dominion but even with the Great Commission in the New Testament it's the same Jesus gave you Dominion I give you Dominion in fact of the matter is you'll do this in my name or you will be here in my stead taking my place I'm going to go away I've got work to do there I'm leaving you here in charge of a work and you're going to do this in my stad in my name come on Amen so now you know if I send you with a message what would you say brother Tim said I have sent you in my name so you use my name for the authority that's why we pray in the name of Jesus we are using his name as the authority he gave me this Authority amen my authority comes because I've been born again and I have dominion so you will be here in my stad acting in my name and you will cast out Devils you will lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you will speak Heaven's Language new tongues you know there's a lot of things needs to be fixed in your life one of them is your tongue will you speak the language of Heaven you say what heaven says about things now God when he made man in the beginning he made him Superior to everything on the earth he gave him jurisdictions on on the earth to control uh animal life the fowl the fish the sea controlled the winds controll plant life he controlled everything Adam could speak to the winds it would stop could speak to the trees they would obey him speak to Wildlife they would obey him speak to the waters whatever it was everything obeyed Adam that's the beginning of man that's what God gave him power of was everything on the earth man was made as we said like a secondary God he was given power to control all things all elements and to the fall he lost that power and after losing his relationship and his friendship with the father then he becomes unconscious of the fact that he is is to have dominion and all of his channels then became clogged up and he he just couldn't come get through there was like a Dark Mist between the earth as Satan becomes the prince of the power of the air and so there again you know man lost he lost his contact with God and he lost his ability to have dominion but now what Adam was in God Christ redeemed back for us amen he broke the veil between that that held out the the held back the blessings of God between us and God Amen let me tell you there's nothing between you and your savior nothing between you and God once you're born again you have a direct line to the throne of grace you have the like to go there anytime to find help or assistance in your time of need but you know Adam had never had to be sick he never had to die he never had to worry he never had a heartache he didn't know fear he just climbing the arms of his father whatever he ask he got everything obeyed him he was God's child he was as a child he's the heir of all things but when man fell he lost his Dominion but then Jesus comes through that Darkness God comes down when we couldn't go into the Earth God came when we couldn't go into heaven God came to Earth and so God comes to bring us back to the Eternal Fellowship relationship to be his sons and daughter again and and I want you to know that we were originally wired for Faith however when face wire is broken or blocked with a some type of insulator the power to move life's mountains cannot flow and that breaking the wire our channel is always doubt unbelief unbelief is sin then there are attributes of sin that comes out from that of of of every kind of demonic influence smoking drinking lying cussing everything else but the thing of it is many times that we because of the crowd we're we're born into and surround us we many times you know we we know what we were in the past and how that we lived and and and we we the the devil always wants to Heap upon you some kind of condemnation and we lose conscience of what God really put you here for he didn't put you here to be defeated or live defeated lives he lived you to walk for he left you here to walk in Victory in fact to the matter even before the disciples were born again you see just on the authority of his word they healed the sick and Devils were made subject to him is that right amen and when he sent out is the 70 and by the way they would later walk off and never even follow him that's right they would they would actually become some of those said Lord Lord have we not cast out devils in your name have we not have we not done many mighty works and he says depart from me I never knew you you're not part of my destiny you're not part of my gender not part of my life I didn't you're not mine you're the devil's children what you see this is where the Bible said in the last day there would be anointed ones of the end time who would be truly anointed but false seed and these would deceive the elect if it were possible the even the elect would be deceived by it if it was possible so now Jesus sends his disciples out just on the authority of his word and just on the authority of his word they healed the sick and Devils were made subject to them I'm I'm just I I'm going to lay this out for a moment because just on the authority of the Bible they went out just on the authority of the words of Jesus and cast Devils out that's right and Luke 8 10:18 said he saw he saw them and said I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven what's he saying I saw Satan's Rule and Dominion broken cuz they had come back and they were rejoicing said Lord we cast out devils in your name amen and they were rejoicing and he said and Jesus even rejoiced and he says hey I saw it myself I was looking in the spirit I you know maybe I didn't see them it wasn't physically there when you laid hands on that one or you cast out that devil but I was there and I saw in the spirit you disturb Satan's Dominion like lightning he fell from heaven and his Dominion was broken over those people and then he further he says in in Luke 9 10:19 behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you hallelujah amen now now listen that the disciples hadn't even been filled with the Holy Ghost yet that's the 70 was not even in the upper room they never went there but they were given power for the word I'm trying to show you the word itself will give power just taking what the word said and acting on it will give you power right this is why we have men and I hate to mention names but like a a Allen you know that was would die a drunk with alcohol in his blood you know a horrible end but yet cast out many Devils what on the authority of the word now if this was true based on the authority of Jesus word that these 70s went out and cast out devils and yet wasn't even born again how how much more true is it that we who have been redeemed and restored to sunship surely we can take those words of Jesus and force Satan's fall hallelujah amen listen if they did it just by looking in the word taking God at his word what about you as a Believer this morning a child of God filled with the Holy Ghost come on now what about you you ought to be disturbing Satan's Dominion pulling down his kingdom shreding down on servants hallelujah amen taking dominion over sickness over problems in your life you were created to be an overcomer you were not made to be defeated but through the fall now it was like as it was the channels of the plumbing or the wiring in our brains and the outlets that faith has been clogged up with business Affair and home life and domestic things it comes so and and all of these are from the crowd and become so clogged up until God I can operate to the channels that he made man far now when God made the human body ever part of it it all had a part to play the teeth the tongues the eyes the nose everything God does is in perfect and operation to make Man live and so God so designed the human body of man so don't you know he also designed and set in order the body of Christ the church if God was so made you so beautifully and wonderfully made don't you know he would do the same with his church amen so he designed us to come together in Heavenly places in our Bel the believer's position in Christ and to have Supernatural workings of God and and Outlets such as gifts of the Spirit and prophecy and wisdom and knowledge and Gifts of healing and all of these other other things are Outlets that God lets out his power don't you know he has that in his in his body amen now maybe not every individual having every one of those but but in the body of Believers God has equipped his body so the spirit could move when I threw my hand out like that a spirit moved it what was that a human Spirit but God's got a God's got a holy spirit working in his body and it works come on somebody it works through Apostles and Prophets and teachers and evangelists and pastors amen it works through the leoes and helps it casts out Devils come on Amen it has workings and miracles and faith and Divine Healing and you know every promise of God is laying there amen the body has to be functional and God is not going to take in a Rapture a body that doesn't function so therefore every gift he lays in the body is important to be there now Satan by his power if he can make the laws his laws work the laws of sin and death how much more should God make his power work if Satan what can make his laws and and and and and we recognize it how much then more should God's laws be recognized among his people of Divine Healing and Revelation and powers and gifts and manifestations of the spirit you know you you cannot even be called the bride and not have the gifts of the Spirit deny that they exist you you've denied his love gifts you you've denied the workings of the Holy Spirit you cannot be the bride and deny the gifts of the Spirit and it's working in the body so brother brandom said I I believe with all my heart we're near in the age that people are going to recognize these things we've had so much vain philosophy and teachings that ought not to be until it sets a human mind to a revolution of thinking on matters of this and that and taking it away from the word of God we start listening to the crowd but if we could just store oursel completely to God and His will and be lost our own thoughts and let the mind of Christ come in it then the operations of the spirit will work through us just as Natural Things does Amen it's you know I'm speaking from a and and just quoting from a very tremendous sermon you L need to really listen to it the fundamental foundation for Faith you can write it down go listen to it digest it now you can't have God without having his word and when you have his word you have God because God and His word is one he is the word but now you can have theology without having God but if it's truly the word it is most spirit and truth if it's really the spirit you're going to take the word and if it's really the word that you have received you will have the spirit with it I mean if you got one you have both amen you know but today there's so many times that the power lines have been clogged that is are not and it's clogged by the screams of the cloud the crowd the unbelief the darkness of the age by by the things that that come in and hinder and it hold back your faith from working but remember the only thing that hindered the human race hinders the human race from being Superior and controlling like they did in the beginning is because the power lines of the outlet of God made in the human being has become clogged up God made you to do his work on the earth you're to have dominion sometimes it's Church theology Church doctrines of Cl that actually clog up your faith lines amen you know can you imagine having this billionaire all wired for light you know uh and it's wired for light it's wired to work you know and you got an unseen force that is coming through those wires an unseen force that is there that has energy in it that can do work am man you know there was a man by the name of Ben Franklin that uh um originally got interested well he may not been the original one but he was one of the in in many of our textbooks we hear about um Ben Franklin you know he he thought there was electricity in the heavens so he got a flew a kite and the in a storm and and I don't I doubt that he really got hit by the lightning but he probably wouldn't have lived through it but you know there was static electricity that came down that kit string and he screamed out I got it I got it it's electricity it's it's there it's in the heavens and then you have a man by the name of Thomas Edison come along and he says hey we got it but I ain't just happy with saying we got it I want to put it to work I want this thing to light up the world and so he would try wire after wire after wire to that would would hold the light and would keep it it going there and F fix it in a vacuum till he invented a light bulb that would only last just a few just a few seconds and then longer and longer and longer and he gave the world a light bulb because he had a vision he had a vision you know the power is here the power is in the heavens the power is in your hair electricity amen power works in your body electricity works in your body and goes from sell to sell and and and makes your your body work and function electricity is in the world electricity is in the heavens electric is in the building but it's got to be put to work and what I'm trying to say is we got power in the word we got examples in the word we got promise in the word but it's got to work it ain't just good enough to stand up and say oh my we got power now of course we've had electricity long enough now that if you know if you went and plugged in your iron to when you was coming to church this morning plugged in your iron going to iron your clothes and it wouldn't come on you wouldn't say oh I always thought it there's no such thing as electricity no you say there's something wrong with this wiring something wrong with the wiring something something wrong there's something broken between here and the [Applause] source amen now the source is almighty God and when we plug in a promise of God and it don't glow if it don't work if it don't heal we don't say oh there's no such thing as healing no more we say there's a broken wire somewhere or somebody is taken and put an insulator there and insulated it and kept it from us but we're going to go get it amen I just say if it work once it'll work again amen if God did it once he'll do it again if he healed once he'll heal again if he saved once he'll save again if he delivered once he'll deliver again if he cast out Devils once he'll cast out Devils again if he gave baren women life he'll do it again whatever God said God will do it plug it in but we got to find the wires that will do it like Edison we got to find the wires that'll carry the current that'll make a light show now brother brandham would be given a gift by an Angel many of you here know the story some of you probably sitting here don't but in 1946 on May the 7th an angel of God walked into through a light a light come into the room and out of that light stepped a man 6' tall 200 lb standing there and said I've been sent to tell you it's been sent from almighty God to tell you of your peculiar life and you've been given a gift of Divine Healing that will that will spread the gospel around the world and we know that's true you can read the historians now and they will tell you the Divine Healing movement all Roberts got his inspiration from William brandham all these other men that came along some of them were copycats some of them were sincere but nevertheless they got inspiration they saw God did it and they said we can do this too and so you you see um there there again brother bradam would have a gift and I'm not going to describe it all but like I said at the beginning of the service you know I was there in the second phase of his ministry where the discernment the word being the discernment of the thoughts and intents of heart that he could even turn his back to the congregation and call them out not even looking at them but calling from behind him like Abra Abram did to Sarah or in Abraham's day when Elohim did to Sarah in the tent behind him now it was a gift of God it was to show us the power in the word it was to vindicate a message now but he would tell us he said now friends that doesn't heal you you see that only brings a person up in faith and when that person comes he may tell me he's got faith I take his word from him but under the anointing you can't come and deceive that where I I know whether you got faith or not he might think he has Faith there's a thing where people thinks they got faith and they haven't got faith but when they're way down here way down here saying they got faith and it isn't up here now what he's talking about faith has to reach the level of God's promise and come together so when your faith is down here you see there's a disconnection so you got to bring the two together your faith and God's promise his word together and so he says it's like tuning the string on an instrument when it comes up and coincides with this up here that thing ready and any demon that's got that person bound has to turn loose when that kind of Faith Comes now you don't have to come up here on the platform it'll act right out there wherever you are but that's the whole purpose of his gift his gift didn't heal healing lays in the atonement that's right ain't no preacher can heal that's right amen healing it lays in the atonement in what Jesus did not what we can do are you with me but what a gift does is it it Tunes your faith that's to believe and when you see it's for me it's right it's the word and I believe it these two come together your faith in the word and something happens there's a light show are you with me amen now we it not even just brother brandom's gift will do that the preaching of the word an anointed preacher in the Pulpit will do the same thing he will attune your faith are you with me now amen what's he doing he's taking the word he's taking the promises he's showing you examples it worked back here it worked for Elijah it worked for Jesus it worked for the disciples it worked for every by the Holy Ghost fill people the acts to church it worked everyone so it'll work for for you Jesus Christ is the same what's he doing he's tuning your faith amen he's telling you God healed that one he gives an example there he healed that one he delivered that one that man was out in sin he was an alcoholic or he was this and God delivered him what's he doing he is tuning your faith amen that what he's done for others he'll do for you too and when your faith will meet the promise the word of God then something's going to happen addictions are broken sir Hallelujah Sinners are saved demons are cast out so the gift of preaching will elevate your faith as we declare the the promises of God Amen because what are we doing we're showing you God's willingness to deliver his promises of to deliver and that he's here and that he's present so we must understand who we are and where we're positioned in Christ now I'm not going to be able to finish this sermon but I want to bring it down like Edison and like Ben Franklin we've had the Franklin that says I got it it's there it's real but they don't know how to access it they don't know how to put it to work we have an Edison that worked tirelessly day and night drinking a cup of coffee wear a away catch an hour of sleep get back up try different wire try this try that because he knew in his heart that somehow he could make this power work he could make this electricity do work now let me just bring it on the spiritual side because we have many you know that says it's there we believe the Bible We Believe it'll work we believe it's true we we see where it is oh my yeah God can do anything there's power in it but they don't know how to make it work it's like brother brandham there's a man come to him and said brother brandham I uh I want to know I want to understand how God moves and how God works says I heard about the gifts of the Spirit and he said I want to see a man that wrote a whole book on it and the man said well no I don't have the gifts but I just wrote a book on it well there's theologians that have written book after book after book but brother brandham talked about it and he says I've been like Edison I've been looking for the way to make this work and I found and I'm going to close on this one I found two wires that will make this work they've got to work in unison and one wire is love and the other is Faith and when you love God you will have faith in his word and that will connect you to the Dy and the current will flow but if you let doubt and fear and unbelief block the way it will not work but if the moment I get whatever God can lead your soul to believe that's yours and I want to say today we've seen it work we've seen it heal we've seen it deliver we've seen it love and faith of people who love God who love his word who keep his Commandments and faith that God's going to do what he said and it works it works it heals the sick it casts out devils it speaks with no tongues it has Outlets of gifts of the Spirit it works that the musicians come do you want it to work in your life go get in love with Jesus with all of your heart and when you really love him you'll believe him whatever he says cuz he cannot deny himself and you as his child cannot deny him want you to Bow your head just a moment [Music] you know last Sunday I preached a sermon on the mountain movers the Holy Spirit just moved throughout dealt with hearts things are happening in the Unseen realm things that you can't see sister Diana sister Diana Sigman sister Sigman I I want to ask you a question sister Diana is Jason still walking in [Music] Victory last Sunday couple of Sundays ago actually now I got to speak to Jason he was one of them wounded in a horrible Church [Music] split him and his wife went drifting away from God [Music] and Li sin has taking his toll on them they've moved here just recently been coming to church I got to talk to him got to meet him speak to him and just told him said you know we have to protect the church from the hard bruises of Satan and when things like that and Christians misbehave and churches split up and fusses come among Believers it HTS and wounds it bruises the woman the church with a child you see you don't you're not full term just by just being justified Believing on Christ that's the conception growth in the womb is sanctification be can people can live in that kind of stage for many years in the womb of the church but if they never came to a full birth then when Trouble Comes the baby is aborted and the church will always lose those they get hurt they get wounded and fall [Music] away and these folks got wounded and hurt [Music] comes back broken having lived a life of sin but the other day after preaching the word and hearing the word preached things that were happening in the Unseen realm and he gets back home didn't even come up for prayer just sitting in the service hearing the word preached and Faith coming and he had already wrote me he said brother Tim already a chang is happening I've already started falling in love with Jesus there's a change already happening and then the other day sitting in the service something moved within his heart he goes home and he's sitting there his wife looks over him said Jason it's been 4 hours 4 4 hours since she smoked a cigarette 4 hours he said well I hadn't even thought of cigarettes I don't even have a thirst for him anymore the desire is all gone he wrote me on Tuesday and he said brother Tim I couldn't go 20 minutes without having a cigarette said I'd go I want to bang my head on the wall I had such an addiction but I tell you what one moment of believing coupled in with a love for God those two wires come together he said brother Tim it's Tuesday
