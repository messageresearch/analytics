[17:53] there was not only salvation
[17:55] but there was healing
[17:58] amen it wasn't a different man that went
[18:00] to calvary that
[18:01] paid your
[18:02] for your healing by his stripes
[18:05] it's the same one that bought your
[18:06] salvation that bore the stripes for your
[18:08] healing amen so if you've become a
[18:11] christian and you've received that
[18:13] nothing stands between you and your
[18:14] healing because you got saved he did
[18:16] that for you
[18:18] he pulled you out of the pig pen how
[18:19] much more is this mortal body
[18:21] amen that's what we believe tonight amen
[18:24] so if you have a need on your heart
[18:25] tonight and you desire that the lord
[18:27] would minister to you we also want to
[18:29] remember
[18:30] brother jerome butts and the butt's
[18:32] family brother jerome has been sent home
[18:34] on hospice care so we certainly want to
[18:36] lift brother jerome up in prayer

[18:41] our time on earth does have a number but
[18:43] we don't have to go down in defeat
[18:45] amen we can go to sleep if that's what
[18:47] the lord would so choose how many have

[18:52] mayor here in minden terry gardner he's
[18:54] been diagnosed with
[18:56] pancreatic cancer and liver cancer in
[18:58] his body and
[19:00] he needs a touch from the lord

[19:07] i want to remember our brother ron
[19:08] spencer as well those that are suffering
[19:11] with cancer sister ruth
[19:14] many around the world are suffering with
[19:16] cancer

[19:20] an angel ministered to a prophet the
[19:22] prophet said what about cancer he said
[19:25] not even cancer

[19:31] lord we'll just go to prayer together
[19:34] heavenly father it's with uplifted hands
[19:36] and
[19:37] bowed heads and
[19:39] hearts lord reaching out to you in love
[19:42] knowing lord that you're the god that
[19:43] predestinated us to love you
[19:46] but lord it's out of a heart of tender
[19:49] mercy that we come this evening
[19:51] expressing that love back to you with
[19:53] voices of adoration and praise and songs
[19:57] of thanksgiving lord and remembering the
[19:59] pit of mary clay that you reached down
[20:02] and took us out of lord and you set us
[20:04] upon a rock lord there was revelation
[20:06] that we could receive lord that you were
[20:08] our savior and lord if you were our
[20:11] savior you are always our savior
[20:13] lord if you are our healer you are
[20:15] always our healer so lord it's with that
[20:18] dependency that we come this evening
[20:20] knowing that we can draw strength from
[20:22] our shady eye as our pastor is
[20:24] ministered
[20:25] so graciously to us lord that we can

[40:44] lord what does it matter what i
[40:46] accomplish lord if it's outside of your
[40:48] will
[40:49] what would it matter lord what we'd
[40:51] accomplish here on earth if we lose our
[40:52] souls
[40:54] but lord may we tonight each and every
[40:56] one look into the word and line up our
[40:58] lives with the word lord and submit our
[41:00] lives to the word and to your leadership
[41:02] and say lord take complete control
[41:04] lord lead me lord guide me lord help me
[41:08] lord jesus just come in line with where
[41:10] it is you want me to be
[41:12] lord i pray that lord not only for each
[41:14] one of our lives but for this service
[41:16] now lord that you would lead in god and
[41:18] speak to our hearts you see lord the
[41:20] direction that you that you led me
[41:23] i just pray lord that you'll take the
[41:25] words of life that you'll bless it to
[41:26] each heart you know who it's for
[41:28] lord you know exactly where the word is
[41:30] supposed to land i pray that you just
[41:33] take control now lord take control of
[41:34] this vessel and this gift and use it for
[41:36] your glory lord lord we love you and we
[41:39] thank you in jesus name we pray
[41:41] amen amen
[41:43] if you have your bibles with me and
[41:45] you'd like to turn with me to joshua the
[41:47] 24th chapter we'll read one verse there
[41:51] and then we're going to turn over and
[41:53] read from romans 8
[41:55] and 13.
[42:01] amen it's good to be in the house of god
[42:03] tonight it's always good to be with
[42:06] believers in his presence and to open up
[42:08] the word of god and to allow it to speak
[42:10] to us
[42:11] it is so rich it is so wonderful even in
[42:14] the correction of the word
[42:16] as sons of god we relish in that knowing
[42:18] that he doesn't correct those that
[42:20] aren't his
[42:21] and we're thankful for every part of the
[42:23] word that he gives us
[42:25] we'll read verse 3 joshua 24-3
[42:29] and it says i took your father abraham
[42:31] from the other side of the flood
[42:34] and led him throughout all the land of
[42:36] canaan and multiplied his seed and gave
[42:40] him isaac in other words what is what
[42:42] he's saying here is abraham wasn't just
[42:44] wandering around i didn't just call him
[42:46] and turn him loose and just send him on
[42:48] a wandering you know here and there and
[42:50] everywhere but i was with him every step
[42:53] of the way and i led him through the
[42:56] land of canaan romans 8 and verse 13
[43:00] romans 8 and verse
[43:02] 13
[43:04] it says for if ye live after the flesh
[43:07] you shall die
[43:09] but if you through the spirit do mortify
[43:11] the deeds of the body you shall live
[43:14] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[43:17] god
[43:18] they are the sons of god
[43:20] for you have not received the spirit of
[43:22] bondage again to fear but you have
[43:24] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[43:26] we cry abba father
[43:27] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[43:30] our spirit that we are the children
[43:33] of god amen you may have your seats
[43:36] tonight and ask that the lord would add
[43:38] his blessing to the reading of the word
[43:41] what we saw there in joshua 24 and 3 is
[43:44] that abraham was led and then we come
[43:46] forward and we see in romans that that
[43:49] for as many that are led by the spirit
[43:50] of god they are the sons of god and the
[43:53] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[43:55] spirit that we are the children of god
[43:58] as children of god what we must do is
[44:00] allow ourselves to be led
[44:03] and that's going to be really our
[44:05] thought and our focus tonight is being
[44:08] led to victory being led
[44:10] to victory and maybe we'll take it a
[44:12] little different pace tonight we'll just
[44:14] see how the lord would lead lay some
[44:16] things in here
[44:17] but we just want him to take control i
[44:20] believe that we all have the desire
[44:23] tonight to be led of god i pray that we
[44:26] do that we're not just wandering around
[44:28] doing what we want to do saying what we
[44:30] want to say living how we want to live
[44:32] and expecting good outcome because i've
[44:34] got bad news for you that's not going to
[44:36] work out
[44:37] but being able to be led and humbling
[44:40] oneself down is how one is actually
[44:43] successful as a christian
[44:46] brother brandon would tell us you know
[44:47] if you if you want to be successful as a
[44:49] christian humble yourself down you want
[44:51] to go somewhere with god how low can you
[44:53] go and and what he's getting at there is
[44:56] being able to lay aside self-will lay
[44:59] aside what it is you want and allow god
[45:01] to lead you in every avenue
[45:04] of your life it's something that i've
[45:06] said many times but but whenever i've
[45:09] throughout the course of my life done
[45:10] things in the moment
[45:12] what what aaron thought should happen or
[45:15] i acted according to my own thoughts or
[45:17] else i made decisions based off of my
[45:20] emotions a rash decision based off my
[45:22] emotions and how i thought i should
[45:24] react it's in those times that i found
[45:26] myself off course it's in those times
[45:29] that i found myself looking around for a
[45:31] moment and sometimes we ask ourselves
[45:32] the question well how did i end up here
[45:34] and in reality we know exactly how we
[45:36] ended up there it's just sometimes hard
[45:37] for ourselves to humble ourselves down
[45:39] and admit i was wrong i'm here because i
[45:42] did what i thought should happen and
[45:44] those are the times we find ourselves
[45:46] off course and the reason we do those
[45:49] things it is is because it is within
[45:51] each and every one of us to take care
[45:54] of us
[45:56] even those of us who we might not
[45:58] consider ourselves selfish people we
[46:00] have something on the inside of us and
[46:02] it's called self-preservation
[46:05] and what self-preservation is it's
[46:07] actually a basic instinct of human
[46:09] nature to try and avoid harm or try to
[46:13] avoid hurt and to make sure that you are
[46:16] okay so our very first instinct is do
[46:20] what's best for me now we many of us are
[46:22] able to battle that we're able to
[46:24] overcome that but it's still usually the
[46:26] first instinct that strikes you what's
[46:28] best for me in this situation what's
[46:31] best for ourselves what's best in this
[46:33] moment that's going to help preserve me
[46:36] but the problem though with humanity is
[46:38] that rarely do we actually know what's
[46:41] best for ourselves
[46:42] rarely do we know what course of action
[46:45] we should actually take and it's because
[46:47] we judge what is best based off of the
[46:50] moment
[46:51] based off of right now and based off of
[46:54] flesh and emotions so according to our
[46:57] flesh according to my emotions according
[46:59] to right now in this moment this is what
[47:01] i should do this is how i should act
[47:03] this is what i should say and what it is
[47:05] is that adam nature of here and now
[47:09] will often override the spiritual nature
[47:12] that would look to our eternal benefits
[47:15] that's how god knows what's best for you
[47:17] as he knows the end from the beginning
[47:19] he knows what's best for you eternally
[47:22] sometimes we look at the scripture there
[47:23] that says all things work together for
[47:25] good and you're like how
[47:28] there is no way that that car wreck
[47:30] right there was good for me
[47:32] no way that this person saying that to
[47:34] me was good for me there's no way
[47:36] because in the moment in our adam
[47:38] fleshly nature we don't like it and we
[47:40] can't see how it was good for us but
[47:42] he's not talking about good for this
[47:45] he's not talking about what's good for
[47:47] your bank account he's not talking about
[47:49] good in that way he's looking at eternal
[47:52] things and he knows what it's going to
[47:54] take to get you
[47:55] there and when he says all things work
[47:57] for that he's saying all things are
[47:59] going to work for good to make sure you
[48:00] have eternal life
[48:03] that's what he's looking at not the here
[48:05] and now not the moment
[48:08] but what we have to do
[48:11] is trust
[48:13] and once again human nature trust is not
[48:16] easy
[48:19] especially when we've been hurt
[48:21] especially in the ups and downs of life
[48:24] it's not easy to trust
[48:26] even when we're speaking of
[48:28] trusting in the lord
[48:31] we have to trust that god's word is true
[48:33] and that he who has started the work
[48:36] is going to finish the work
[48:38] the one who brought us out will most
[48:40] definitely take us in we have to get to
[48:43] the place to where we trust that the
[48:44] same power that delivered us is the same
[48:47] power that's going to see us all the way
[48:49] through to the end look i don't know
[48:50] what's going to happen between now and
[48:53] then i don't know what's going to happen
[48:54] between being filled with the holy ghost
[48:56] and going in the rapture i don't know
[48:58] about every single up and down i don't
[49:00] know about every trial i'm going to face
[49:01] i can't tell you what's coming towards
[49:03] you and your family next week i don't
[49:05] know those things but i know he promised
[49:07] that he's going to take us out and he's
[49:09] going to take us in that's where the
[49:11] promise lies i can't see every trial
[49:14] that i'm going to face i don't know
[49:16] every struggle that's going to come
[49:17] along the way we don't get a heads up
[49:20] about these things
[49:22] they don't tell the lord don't say
[49:24] brother derek tomorrow your transmission
[49:25] is going out
[49:27] but it
[49:28] happened and god is still good and
[49:31] you're still gonna make it you're still
[49:33] gonna overcome what came against you
[49:35] this week i don't know but god is still
[49:37] good his word is still true and you're
[49:39] still gonna make it i don't know what's
[49:41] coming tomorrow but god is still good
[49:43] his word is still true and you're still
[49:45] gonna make it because that is what he's
[49:48] told us i'm gonna take you out and i'm
[49:50] gonna see you all the way in
[49:54] that's how it was with moses moses was
[49:56] just given the basics
[49:58] it says in exodus 3 and 8 and i am come
[50:01] down to deliver them out of the land of
[50:03] the egyptians and to bring them up out
[50:05] of that land unto a good land and a
[50:07] large unto a land flowing with milk and
[50:09] honey
[50:12] i've come down to deliver them and to
[50:14] take them to a land
[50:16] now in the course of his conversation
[50:18] with god he's told a bit about how
[50:20] pharaoh's going to say no and he's not
[50:22] going to let him go and he's and he's
[50:24] told that egypt's going to be plagued
[50:25] and then he says and you're going to
[50:27] spoil the egyptians but other than that
[50:30] that's all he told him
[50:33] he says i'm going to take you out and
[50:34] i'm going to take you in listen the red
[50:36] sea was not discussed
[50:39] there was not a moment where it was
[50:40] brought up in conversation all the
[50:42] hunger and the thirst was not discussed
[50:45] all the grumbling and complaining was
[50:47] not discussed the serpents biting folks
[50:50] hey it had been nice to know that was
[50:51] coming but it was not discussed
[50:54] he wasn't told about the serpents he
[50:56] wasn't told about the red sea he wasn't
[50:58] told that they were going to be hungry
[51:00] he said i'm going to take you out and
[51:01] i'm going to take you in and in between
[51:03] there moses had to trust the leadership
[51:06] of the lord he had to put his hands in
[51:08] his hand and say lord hold my hand lead
[51:11] me guide me take me all the way lord i'm
[51:14] trusting in you
[51:19] the only thing that he knew was that the
[51:20] same power that was going to lose the
[51:22] children of israel is going to be the
[51:24] same power that brings me back to this
[51:25] mountain to worship
[51:28] and the lord said now go
[51:31] moses had some excuses but he didn't
[51:32] want to hear him he said i've told you
[51:34] enough
[51:35] but lord what about this and what about
[51:36] that i've told you enough
[51:38] church if there's ever been a people who
[51:40] the lord could look at and say look i've
[51:41] told you enough it's us he's told us
[51:44] enough to trust him as a matter of fact
[51:46] he's done more than told us he showed us
[51:48] he showed us time and time again that
[51:49] nothing's going to stand before him he
[51:51] showed us time and time again that
[51:53] sickness won't stand he showed us time
[51:55] and again that depression won't stand
[51:57] that the change of oppression won't
[51:58] stand he has told us and he has showed
[52:01] us and now he's saying now go just go do
[52:04] what i told you is going to happen
[52:05] fulfill what i've called you to fulfill
[52:08] walk and trust and allow me to lead you
[52:10] in the same power that brought you here
[52:13] that saved your soul that delivered you
[52:15] is going to see you all the way through
[52:22] and against all the odds
[52:27] he says
[52:28] go moses
[52:30] now you have to understand moses
[52:31] completely understood the odds
[52:34] he knew the power of egypt
[52:36] he he had tried and failed before to be
[52:39] a deliverer
[52:40] but this time there was going to be
[52:42] something different
[52:44] this time the outcome would be different
[52:46] this time he would overcome where he had
[52:48] failed in the past because this time he
[52:51] had met the pillar of fire
[52:53] this time there was something different
[52:54] about moses brother branham says going
[52:56] down to egypt to take over going down to
[52:58] take over a one-man invasion and the
[53:01] silly part he did it
[53:03] brother branham says the silly part he
[53:05] did it why he had faith in the god that
[53:08] he had experience with
[53:10] god who who made the difference he
[53:12] didn't need his military training he
[53:15] didn't need his scholarships he needed
[53:17] an experience and the burning bush had
[53:20] what moses lacked
[53:23] listen if you've been falling short if
[53:25] you haven't been able to overcome if
[53:26] you've tried and tried and tried and
[53:28] failed let me tell you something the
[53:29] burning bush has what you lack the
[53:32] pillar of fire has exactly what you need
[53:34] for you to overcome every trial every
[53:36] situation the pillar of fire has what
[53:39] you lack
[53:41] once you have your own backside of the
[53:42] desert experience once you have your own
[53:45] burning bush experience you can go back
[53:47] to where you failed you can go back to
[53:49] that thing that hindered you and you
[53:51] will overcome it because it's no longer
[53:53] you doing it it's no longer your feeble
[53:55] attempts but the pillar of fire is going
[53:57] with you the pillar of fire is going
[53:59] before you and the pillar of fire is
[54:00] overcoming through your life
[54:03] it's no longer just you going and doing
[54:05] it it's no longer you fighting the
[54:06] battle but once you find that pillar of
[54:08] fire that has what you like you can and
[54:11] will overcome everything in your way
[54:21] moses didn't have to hide anymore
[54:25] he didn't have to be afraid anymore
[54:28] and once you meet this pillar of fire
[54:30] you won't have to run anymore
[54:32] you won't have to hide anymore you will
[54:33] be led by the holy ghost and the holy
[54:35] ghost will always lead you to victory
[54:40] one thing i want you to focus on tonight
[54:41] is no matter where it goes through briar
[54:43] patches over rivers through swamps
[54:45] wherever it takes you is leading you to
[54:47] victory
[54:49] if you can keep your eye on that lord
[54:50] why am i here what's going on it doesn't
[54:53] just remember he's leading you to
[54:55] victory that is the end result of any
[54:58] campaign where the holy ghost is the
[55:00] leader
[55:01] men have had military campaigns and they
[55:04] failed but when the lord is leading your
[55:06] campaign victory is the only outcome
[55:08] that there can be so it doesn't matter
[55:10] where you end up there will be victory
[55:13] now notice we said victory
[55:16] there can't be victory without
[55:18] a battle we get the idea sometimes that
[55:21] the holy ghost keeps us from battles
[55:24] wrong
[55:27] couldn't be any more wrong
[55:29] as a matter of fact the moment that mo
[55:32] that moses met the burning bush he sent
[55:34] straight back to the thing that he'd
[55:35] been running from for 40 years
[55:38] the very moment he meets the pillar of
[55:40] fire he says now quit running boy and
[55:42] get back in the fight get back where you
[55:44] ran from get back there and face the
[55:45] very thing that's been terrifying you
[55:47] for all these years
[55:49] he runs him straight into a battle he
[55:51] runs him straight into a trial we see
[55:53] the same thing in jesus's life there at
[55:55] the river jordan when the holy spirit
[55:57] comes and immediately he's led into the
[56:00] wilderness for a battle he's led into
[56:03] the wilderness there's no time for rest
[56:05] and relaxation here it is it's time to
[56:07] go it's time to test this it's time to
[56:09] make sure you got what you said you got
[56:11] you start claiming the baptism of the
[56:13] holy ghost and what you just did is put
[56:14] a big target on you and said here i am
[56:16] devil
[56:18] here i am
[56:19] oh you you you got the holy ghost we
[56:21] about to find out
[56:24] you got the holy ghost you about to be
[56:25] tested you about to be tried you're
[56:27] about to be put into battle but let me
[56:28] tell you you're about to have victory
[56:31] nobody said it's going to be easy nobody
[56:33] said it's going to be a bed of roses
[56:35] it's going to be war it's going to be
[56:36] tough it's going to be difficult there's
[56:38] going to be times you don't know where
[56:39] to turn there's going to be tears
[56:41] there's going to be worry and fred i
[56:42] understand those things but just hold on
[56:45] and trust and believe and let him lead
[56:46] you and you will be victorious
[56:50] victory is certain when you're following
[56:52] the leadership of the holy spirit
[57:01] since we're looking at
[57:03] being led tonight
[57:07] we've said before that blessings
[57:09] really aren't
[57:11] a true indication that you are in god's
[57:13] will
[57:15] but hard trials are also not always an
[57:17] indication that you aren't in god's will
[57:20] see the devil likes to get us on that
[57:22] when trials come when everything falls
[57:24] apart and he whispered it's all your
[57:25] fault
[57:27] what'd you do wrong
[57:29] where'd you fail god
[57:31] where'd you get out of his will
[57:33] and we begin to question ourselves
[57:36] you know what's happening in those
[57:38] moments
[57:40] you're having a trial
[57:43] christians have trials
[57:44] lots of them
[57:46] christians have hardships lots of them
[57:49] that's what's happening it's life life's
[57:51] happening
[57:52] you're in the middle of what's called
[57:55] life they are going to be a part of your
[57:56] life but unlike somebody without the
[57:58] leadership of god another part of your
[58:00] life is victory another part of your
[58:02] life is overcoming another part of your
[58:04] life is rising above and putting satan
[58:07] under your feet it's not just trials
[58:08] trials trials it's victories victories
[58:10] victories it's winning winning winning
[58:13] there is
[58:14] there are rewards that come with being
[58:16] led by the spirit and that is you will
[58:18] always be led to victory brother branham
[58:21] says when you see something going wrong
[58:22] for a fella that don't mean he's being
[58:24] whipped by god
[58:26] it might not be that he's out of the
[58:27] will of god he knows in his heart
[58:30] whether he's listening to the trumpet or
[58:33] not
[58:34] he knows within his heart don't look at
[58:36] trials and tribulations in another man's
[58:38] life and i mean that's the same thing
[58:39] they did to job secret sinner don't be a
[58:42] job's friend
[58:43] don't be a joke but job's friends are
[58:45] not good friends
[58:46] all right
[58:47] job's friends are not good friends be
[58:49] that person that goes to prayer for
[58:50] somebody and struggle be that person
[58:52] that lends a shoulder that offers a
[58:54] positive word that says how can i help
[58:56] how can we pray we're here for you
[58:57] brother we're standing with you brother
[59:00] and then we're not saying that god won't
[59:01] use these circumstances or circumstances
[59:03] of life sometimes to get your attention
[59:05] sure he will
[59:06] sometimes he'll use these things and
[59:08] he'll allow things to come to draw you
[59:10] closer to him sure he will
[59:12] sometimes he uses the circumstances of
[59:14] life the trials at home or the trials in
[59:17] a church to make you check yourself and
[59:19] make sure that you that you're where
[59:21] you're supposed to be with him in your
[59:24] spiritual walk
[59:25] to make sure that you're where you're
[59:27] supposed to be as you walk with god
[59:28] brother branham would say the cloudy
[59:30] skies and storms of life though are no
[59:34] signs of god's disapproval
[59:36] they're not signs of god's disapproval
[59:39] we are just supposed to walk by faith
[59:41] and line our life up to the word and if
[59:44] our life lines up to the word and we're
[59:46] following his leadership then come what
[59:48] may i know i can stand come what may i
[59:51] know i'm gonna make it well how do you
[59:52] know you're right because i've looked
[59:54] into the mirror of god's word i'm living
[59:57] according to god's word i'm following
[59:59] his leadership i'm doing what he said
[1:00:01] now if a trial comes i'm standing where
[1:00:04] i'm supposed to stand i'm where i'm
[1:00:06] supposed to be the children of israel
[1:00:08] were supposed to be at the red sea they
[1:00:10] were not off course
[1:00:12] they were following the leadership of
[1:00:14] the lord and he led them to the red sea
[1:00:19] so many people say well i just want to
[1:00:20] know the will of god for my life
[1:00:23] that's always a tricky
[1:00:26] one because really what they're saying
[1:00:29] is i want to know the future
[1:00:33] i want to know what god wants me to do
[1:00:35] in seven years
[1:00:38] yeah
[1:00:39] moses would have loved to know they were
[1:00:40] coming up on a red sea too
[1:00:43] he would have loved to know about them
[1:00:45] serpents there's a lot of things we
[1:00:47] would love to know that's not how it
[1:00:48] operates
[1:00:49] there are no big neon signs outside your
[1:00:52] door that says
[1:00:55] today is going to be an awful day
[1:00:58] make sure you don't go here because
[1:01:00] that's not realistic
[1:01:01] that's not the leadership of the lord
[1:01:03] that you avoid every single calamity and
[1:01:06] you avoid every single trial and
[1:01:07] everything the leadership of the lord is
[1:01:09] knowing he's got my hand i'm walking
[1:01:11] according to his word so when i come to
[1:01:13] one of these things he brought me to it
[1:01:14] he's going to bring me through it that
[1:01:16] is knowing the will of god as i what is
[1:01:19] the will of god for you to walk
[1:01:20] according to his word
[1:01:22] for you to seek daily in prayer lord
[1:01:24] what would you have mean it's not always
[1:01:26] an audible voice but just knowing that
[1:01:28] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:01:29] ordered of the lord
[1:01:31] it's not that he's going to tell you the
[1:01:34] future
[1:01:35] the only future that we're promised to
[1:01:37] know is that we're going to make it
[1:01:39] that's enough for me the only future i
[1:01:41] need to know is that i'm going to win
[1:01:43] the only future i need to know is i'm
[1:01:44] going to the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:01:46] i know that satan's going to be cast
[1:01:48] into a lake of fire i know that i'm
[1:01:50] going to live eternity with my lord and
[1:01:51] savior jesus christ that's enough future
[1:01:54] for me i know that and so between here
[1:01:56] and there i'm going to trust and i'm
[1:01:58] going to submit myself to his will
[1:02:06] it says he will be a lamp unto my feet
[1:02:09] in a light unto my path
[1:02:13] the scripture lightens us to likens us
[1:02:15] to sheep
[1:02:16] and there's many examples in the
[1:02:18] scripture to this but one that we'll all
[1:02:19] know psalms 23 and 1
[1:02:22] the lord is my shepherd
[1:02:24] i shall not want
[1:02:26] he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:02:28] pastures
[1:02:29] he leadeth me beside the still waters
[1:02:32] he restoreth my soul
[1:02:34] he leadeth me in the paths of
[1:02:36] righteousness for his name's sake
[1:02:39] brother branham says god has likened us
[1:02:40] unto sheep and if anyone knows about
[1:02:43] raising sheep in the nature of sheep why
[1:02:45] you know that a sheep cannot find his
[1:02:47] way around
[1:02:48] he has to be led
[1:02:51] he says oh a lamb must be lead it has no
[1:02:54] way to lead itself did you ever see a
[1:02:56] lamb lost when a sheep gets lost he just
[1:02:59] totally helpless he cannot help himself
[1:03:02] he's lost he's got to be led and a real
[1:03:06] genuine christian has to be led
[1:03:09] he has no intelligence of his own to
[1:03:11] know anything about god he just goes by
[1:03:15] the leading of the spirit
[1:03:19] it's critical that we humble ourselves
[1:03:22] to the place and recognize what brother
[1:03:24] branham says right here to be the truth
[1:03:26] a real genuine christian has got to be
[1:03:30] led
[1:03:31] he just goes by the leading of the
[1:03:34] spirit
[1:03:36] church we have to be led by the spirit
[1:03:38] and he and he comes to us and he speaks
[1:03:40] to us and he speaks to us in a still
[1:03:42] small voice
[1:03:44] and we live in a world of i would say a
[1:03:46] billion voices
[1:03:50] of blaring voices that many times we
[1:03:52] have no choice but to hear
[1:03:54] many other voices we do have a choice
[1:03:56] and we let them in willingly
[1:03:58] voices that we allow in voices that we
[1:04:00] feed on voices of negativity there are
[1:04:03] so many voices that used two people
[1:04:05] didn't have to deal with
[1:04:07] used two it was just radio in a
[1:04:09] newspaper
[1:04:11] but now you have the internet and social
[1:04:13] media and because of the all of the
[1:04:15] different things and the accumulation of
[1:04:17] voices and knowledge and information we
[1:04:19] never take a break from all the voices
[1:04:22] that are constantly inundating us
[1:04:25] you know there's a there's a i heard a
[1:04:26] guy say the other day he said you know
[1:04:28] if you don't listen to the if you don't
[1:04:31] he said newspaper he said if you don't
[1:04:32] read the newspaper you're uninformed
[1:04:35] and if you do read it you're misinformed
[1:04:38] so what do you do
[1:04:40] if you don't pay attention to the news
[1:04:42] you're uninformed and if you do you're
[1:04:44] misinformed but let me tell you what
[1:04:46] there's something that will never
[1:04:47] misinform you there is something that is
[1:04:49] true there is something you can hang
[1:04:51] your soul on we got to get back to
[1:04:53] reading this right here reading the word
[1:04:55] of god trusting in the word of god
[1:04:57] walking in the word of god eating on the
[1:04:59] word of god and letting our genetics
[1:05:01] manifest themselves and turn ourselves
[1:05:03] away from all the millions of voices out
[1:05:05] there that is buying for a piece of our
[1:05:07] soul
[1:05:08] buying for a piece of our mind but we
[1:05:11] inundate ourselves with the opinions of
[1:05:13] this and and this news organization and
[1:05:15] that one's better than this one and
[1:05:17] every single one of them slanted because
[1:05:18] ain't none of them based on the word of
[1:05:20] god
[1:05:21] and even worse than that it seems like
[1:05:23] we we feed ourselves on the opinions of
[1:05:26] every single bob and sue on facebook and
[1:05:28] instagram
[1:05:29] and we i mean people that ain't even
[1:05:32] experts well that's not true
[1:05:34] it's actually amazing about how their
[1:05:36] ability to to be an immunologist
[1:05:39] and then the next week be an expert on
[1:05:40] vaccines and then the next work next
[1:05:43] week be a bible scholar and then next
[1:05:46] week they're scholars on international
[1:05:47] affairs and russians foreign wars it's
[1:05:50] amazing how much your neighbor knows
[1:05:55] i mean
[1:05:56] and most of them ain't never left their
[1:05:58] hometown but they can tell you all about
[1:05:59] it
[1:06:00] they can tell you all the research and
[1:06:02] all that and where they get it from the
[1:06:04] same slanted places that everybody else
[1:06:06] has an opportunity and by the time it
[1:06:08] gets to you it's so slanted it's just a
[1:06:09] circle
[1:06:10] it's just mass confusion we got to get
[1:06:12] away from the confusion look i'm not
[1:06:15] saying there's anything wrong with news
[1:06:16] i like to keep up to date there's things
[1:06:18] that that's prophesied about that you
[1:06:20] like to follow and look and see because
[1:06:21] they are time pieces but you can't let
[1:06:24] that become your focus you can't let
[1:06:25] that become you die you can't let that
[1:06:27] be all you're feeding upon all day every
[1:06:29] day you'll be a confused person you'll
[1:06:31] be an unstable person you'll be a
[1:06:33] troubled person but if you'll just
[1:06:35] continue to feed right here and put your
[1:06:37] feet on the solid rock there'll be no
[1:06:39] confusion there'll be no shaking
[1:06:41] there'll be none of that because this
[1:06:43] right here is truth and you can rest
[1:06:45] your soul upon it and it'll never be
[1:06:47] slanted in any way
[1:06:49] if you take it from the message of the
[1:06:50] hour
[1:06:51] but these people they become experts all
[1:06:54] in a week's time
[1:06:55] and all these voices are crying out for
[1:06:58] your ear and if we aren't careful we
[1:07:00] belet it we'll let it begin to stifle
[1:07:02] the only voice that really matters and
[1:07:04] it's that still small voice of the holy
[1:07:06] ghost that's supposed to lead and guide
[1:07:08] you
[1:07:09] don't lose contact with the still small
[1:07:12] voice
[1:07:14] don't lose contact with the one who is
[1:07:16] to be leading you remember you are to be
[1:07:19] a sheep
[1:07:20] and to be a sheep you must be willing to
[1:07:22] allow yourself to be led of the shepherd
[1:07:26] and the problem is we get to the point
[1:07:28] that well sure maybe we know what his
[1:07:29] voice sounds like but but but we can't
[1:07:32] er the other voices we've let in have
[1:07:34] become so loud that it drowns that voice
[1:07:36] out it's not that you wouldn't recognize
[1:07:38] it if it spoke but the problem is you
[1:07:41] can't hear it because there's so much
[1:07:42] other noise being pulled into your life
[1:07:45] you must stay in tune with the still
[1:07:48] small voice we need to stop for a minute
[1:07:50] tonight
[1:07:51] and get on the dial some of these kids
[1:07:53] probably know what the dial is
[1:07:56] i wouldn't know what to say i'll just
[1:07:57] talk to the old people get on the dial
[1:08:00] and dial back in
[1:08:02] to the holy ghost
[1:08:04] dial back into that still small voice
[1:08:06] dial back into the right frequency you
[1:08:08] know how you check
[1:08:13] these kids like what
[1:08:16] am radio
[1:08:20] we went way back but we got to dial back
[1:08:23] in to the right frequency we got to get
[1:08:25] locked back into the message that's
[1:08:26] trying to take us out of here
[1:08:28] brother brown says a few days before the
[1:08:30] old mother eagle takes her little ones
[1:08:31] on a flight you know what she does first
[1:08:34] she gets up there she stands up on the
[1:08:36] nest some eagles are 14 feet from tip to
[1:08:39] tip the most mammoth bird we got he will
[1:08:41] stand on this nest the old mother eagle
[1:08:43] is usually the largest of the two she'll
[1:08:45] walk back and forth over this nest and
[1:08:47] she will scream call that's so shrill
[1:08:51] that that
[1:08:52] that's
[1:08:53] so shrill that the eagle gives what's
[1:08:55] she trying to do she's trying to teach
[1:08:57] her babies the sound of her voice
[1:09:00] they're going to get into some perils in
[1:09:02] a little while so they've got to know
[1:09:04] the sound of the mother's voice i tell
[1:09:07] you it pays to listen to the voice of
[1:09:10] god the still small voice that speaks
[1:09:12] deep and rich it attracts the attention
[1:09:16] of the people there's gonna be some
[1:09:18] perils along the way he says he says
[1:09:20] there's some perils just ahead but if
[1:09:23] you're locked into the voice of the
[1:09:24] eagle if you're locked into the voice of
[1:09:27] god he's going to take care of you you
[1:09:29] can hear when he's leading here you can
[1:09:31] hear him when he's leading you over
[1:09:32] there you won't find yourself messed up
[1:09:34] and tangled up and tied up because you
[1:09:36] didn't hear the voice of god
[1:09:39] in those perils you have to have faith
[1:09:42] in those perils you have to recognize
[1:09:44] it's god that's leading me
[1:09:46] listen there were perils between egypt
[1:09:49] and the promised land there's going to
[1:09:51] be perils tomorrow there's going to be
[1:09:53] perils next next week but you have to
[1:09:55] have faith that i know that it's god
[1:09:58] that's leading me i know that it's the
[1:10:00] holy spirit that's leading me
[1:10:02] i've been following this still small
[1:10:04] voice all the way and he didn't lead me
[1:10:07] here to lose wherever i'm at tonight he
[1:10:09] didn't lead me here to lose wherever i
[1:10:12] end up at tomorrow he did not lead you
[1:10:14] there to lose but he led you there for
[1:10:16] victory
[1:10:18] when you're following that still small
[1:10:19] voice in your darkest trial when you've
[1:10:22] heard the worst of the doctor's reports
[1:10:24] when your symptoms are worse than ever
[1:10:26] when you're hurting when your friends
[1:10:28] walk away when confusion sets in
[1:10:31] when all those things are going on but
[1:10:33] if you've been following that still
[1:10:35] small voice
[1:10:36] oh and then he begins to speak to you
[1:10:38] maybe it's in a sermon maybe it's in
[1:10:40] your quiet time but he says i am the
[1:10:42] lord thy god that healeth thee he says
[1:10:45] i'll stick closer than a brother he says
[1:10:47] i will see you through he says i'm
[1:10:49] jehovah jireh he says i am el shaddai
[1:10:52] draw straight from me
[1:10:54] when you've been following that still
[1:10:56] small voice in those darkest moments
[1:10:58] he'll come to you he'll speak to you
[1:11:01] and once you've heard that still small
[1:11:03] voice for your situation you can go
[1:11:05] forward fearlessly
[1:11:08] you can go forward fearlessly knowing
[1:11:10] it's all going to work out for my good
[1:11:12] he spoke to me i've been following that
[1:11:14] still small voice
[1:11:20] we have to be sheep tonight
[1:11:23] and we can't lose contact with the
[1:11:25] shepherd
[1:11:27] because you have no hope on your own
[1:11:30] a sheep stands no chance amongst the
[1:11:32] wolves whenever they get away from the
[1:11:33] shepherd
[1:11:35] a sheep lost in the wilderness is going
[1:11:36] to be
[1:11:37] devoured
[1:11:39] it's going to be eaten it's going to be
[1:11:40] torn apart so you must stay in touch
[1:11:42] with that voice it works it works both
[1:11:45] ways
[1:11:46] if you're constantly in touch with that
[1:11:48] voice it becomes easier and easier for
[1:11:50] you to recognize the voice when it
[1:11:52] speaks and yet if you ignore it enough
[1:11:55] times
[1:11:56] or you miss it enough times
[1:11:59] it becomes harder and harder for you to
[1:12:01] recognize that voice when it speaks
[1:12:04] i saw a church sign down in dixie in the
[1:12:06] other day
[1:12:07] it said the problem with missing church
[1:12:09] is pretty soon you won't miss it
[1:12:16] the problem with missing churches pretty
[1:12:17] soon you won't miss it it won't be
[1:12:19] something that's pulling oh i hate to i
[1:12:21] can't believe we have to miss sometimes
[1:12:23] things happen and you can't believe it
[1:12:25] it hurts you don't you want to be here
[1:12:26] you want to worship you want to be with
[1:12:28] your brothers and sisters but let that
[1:12:29] happen over and over and over and pretty
[1:12:32] soon as well i mean this is just what we
[1:12:33] do we go every other time or we go one
[1:12:36] out of four or two out of four or
[1:12:38] whatever it is
[1:12:39] and the problem with missing the voice
[1:12:41] of god is pretty soon you won't even
[1:12:43] know that he's speaking to you and
[1:12:44] you'll miss it every time that he tries
[1:12:46] to lead you
[1:12:48] if you tune it out enough it gets easier
[1:12:50] and easier to miss
[1:12:52] brother brown says oh god let me stand
[1:12:54] still hide me in the cleft of the rock
[1:12:56] lord i want to hear that still small
[1:12:59] voice
[1:13:00] and brother when you want set still
[1:13:03] enough and listen
[1:13:05] till you can hear that still small voice
[1:13:06] of christ it's different from any
[1:13:09] message you ever heard in your life it
[1:13:11] brings a peace it brings a satisfaction
[1:13:14] it does something to you that stirs your
[1:13:16] innermost being you're never the same
[1:13:19] once you ever have an opportunity and
[1:13:20] you know that he spoke to your heart it
[1:13:23] it like nothing else it'll settle the
[1:13:25] issue when you're dealing with something
[1:13:27] and praying about something you can look
[1:13:28] to the word and we trust in the word but
[1:13:30] if that's still a small voice ever drops
[1:13:32] down it confirms to you that it's over
[1:13:34] buddy there ain't a devil in hell shake
[1:13:36] you from it there ain't a devil in hell
[1:13:38] that'll move you so listen for the still
[1:13:40] small voice stay in touch with the still
[1:13:41] small voice stay in contact with the
[1:13:44] shepherd that is supposed to be leading
[1:13:46] you
[1:13:49] the lord has promised to not only take
[1:13:50] us out but he has promised to take us in
[1:13:53] and our focus has to remain
[1:13:56] on the promised land
[1:13:58] on complete fulfillment of the promise
[1:14:01] and although it is there is a wilderness
[1:14:03] journey and although we are to be led in
[1:14:06] the wilderness and we know he will
[1:14:08] provide in the wilderness and we should
[1:14:11] strive even in our earthly walk we
[1:14:13] should strive
[1:14:15] to be all that we can be here
[1:14:18] we should
[1:14:19] you should strive to be all that you can
[1:14:21] be but
[1:14:22] no no one no christian is called to be
[1:14:25] lazy and unfruitful
[1:14:27] you're supposed to do all you can you're
[1:14:30] supposed to strive to be the best but
[1:14:31] our main goal is not on how successful
[1:14:34] can i be in the wilderness
[1:14:37] and i want you to be successful i want
[1:14:39] you to have a career i want you to
[1:14:41] provide i want those things to
[1:14:43] especially you men and you women
[1:14:45] whatever god calls you to be all you can
[1:14:47] be here on earth but our goal isn't to
[1:14:49] see how successful we can be in the
[1:14:51] wilderness
[1:14:53] that can't become our main goal
[1:14:55] we we often speak
[1:14:57] of not getting caught up in all the the
[1:14:59] news of the world even as i said earlier
[1:15:01] in the modern events all around us and
[1:15:03] trying not to get caught up in the wars
[1:15:05] and the sickness and the rumors of wars
[1:15:07] and the evil of politics trying not to
[1:15:09] get caught up and all that that's good
[1:15:10] advice
[1:15:11] but an even greater distraction for many
[1:15:14] is this distraction of success
[1:15:22] we hit this for a moment last wednesday
[1:15:24] as we dealt with finding the will of god
[1:15:27] that earthly blessings do not always
[1:15:29] mean you're in his will
[1:15:31] some of the most irresistible
[1:15:32] temptations come in the wake of
[1:15:34] blessings
[1:15:38] excuse me there is a tendency
[1:15:41] in humanity to coast
[1:15:43] after a breakthrough
[1:15:45] there is a tendency to coast as you near
[1:15:48] the end studies show that in military
[1:15:50] campaigns and large construction
[1:15:52] projects that towards the very end of
[1:15:54] the campaign or towards the very end of
[1:15:56] a project is when most accidents take
[1:15:58] place
[1:16:00] because the attitude is we finished
[1:16:03] we made it we're there and there's a
[1:16:06] relaxing that takes place a guard as it
[1:16:09] were gets let down
[1:16:12] we let down some of our spiritual
[1:16:14] defenses
[1:16:15] and so many times after a blessing is
[1:16:17] when some of our greatest temptations
[1:16:19] come whereas suffering and trials not
[1:16:21] that i'm advocating for suffering and
[1:16:23] trials i like to avoid as many of them
[1:16:25] as possible and as much of it as
[1:16:26] possible
[1:16:28] but on the other hand they tend to make
[1:16:29] a person draw nigh unto god
[1:16:32] they they they make a person seek god
[1:16:35] more and to be super vigilant and to
[1:16:37] strengthen their defenses because the
[1:16:39] reason is suffering will quickly turn
[1:16:41] one away from believing that they are
[1:16:43] self-sufficient or believing i can do
[1:16:46] this on my own and i can take care of
[1:16:48] this and you move away from that urge
[1:16:50] and you're like god i need help
[1:16:52] but the successful person many times
[1:16:54] thinks look what i've done
[1:16:58] look what i've accomplished
[1:17:02] what happens to even king david
[1:17:05] who in the caves and on the run for his
[1:17:06] life would write so many of the greatest
[1:17:08] psalms because he was in tune with god
[1:17:10] he was seeking god he was seeking
[1:17:12] deliverance he was seeking salvation he
[1:17:15] was surrounded by his enemies
[1:17:17] but where was all that looking to god
[1:17:19] and seeking for god when he looked
[1:17:20] across there and saw bathsheba on the
[1:17:22] roof
[1:17:24] and fell
[1:17:29] what happened was his dependence on the
[1:17:31] leadership of god had come down
[1:17:34] because i'm king now not recognizing
[1:17:37] that even as a king you must be a sheep
[1:17:41] even as a king even as an important
[1:17:43] person
[1:17:44] even as a front row second row third row
[1:17:47] song leader deacon minister i don't care
[1:17:49] who you are where you are you have to be
[1:17:51] led by the holy spirit in order to
[1:17:53] achieve victory you have to be led by
[1:17:55] the holy spirit or you will fall that
[1:17:58] goes for every single one of us
[1:18:01] but he forgot that he had to be a sheep
[1:18:03] look at the rich young ruler and his
[1:18:05] inability to let go of earthly pursuits
[1:18:07] for heavenly game
[1:18:09] why was it so hard for him to let go
[1:18:11] when he himself knew he needed to let go
[1:18:14] he knew he was lacking
[1:18:16] he came to jesus probably a better
[1:18:18] person than anybody in this building
[1:18:21] jesus said you got to do this you got to
[1:18:23] do this you got to do this he said i've
[1:18:24] done all that since i was a kid
[1:18:27] no mark against him
[1:18:29] but even he knew he was lacking
[1:18:32] he had done so well that just said jesus
[1:18:34] looked at him and he loved him
[1:18:37] there weren't many like this one but why
[1:18:40] couldn't he let go of his earthly
[1:18:42] possessions for heavenly gain
[1:18:44] what was it he knew he should it's
[1:18:47] because he thought his wealth was his
[1:18:49] own accomplishment
[1:18:52] make sure that as we go through life and
[1:18:54] we're blessed make sure that we always
[1:18:56] recognize exactly where your success
[1:18:59] comes from
[1:19:00] recognizes him that gave it to you so if
[1:19:03] he asked for it back be willing to give
[1:19:05] it back it was his all along it never
[1:19:07] was yours
[1:19:08] it wasn't something you built
[1:19:10] because what happens is as humans we
[1:19:12] tend to feel like we have accomplished
[1:19:14] something great in our career or we've
[1:19:16] accomplished something great in our
[1:19:18] accumulation of wealth or we've
[1:19:19] accomplished something great because
[1:19:21] we've built a business
[1:19:23] and so we have a death grip on it we're
[1:19:25] not going to turn it loose because look
[1:19:26] what i've done look what i've created
[1:19:29] and when he comes and he calls you to
[1:19:30] something else he calls you to something
[1:19:32] different you're like
[1:19:35] but this this is my business
[1:19:38] this i've worked so hard for this this
[1:19:40] is what this is what i've done no this
[1:19:43] is what god has done in your life this
[1:19:46] is where god has blessed you
[1:19:48] this is what god gave you for a time
[1:19:50] period
[1:19:51] oh we've built our life in a certain way
[1:19:53] in a certain place around a certain
[1:19:55] career and now god's telling you to move
[1:19:57] on from that or telling you to move to
[1:19:59] another place and the question you want
[1:20:01] to ask is well what about my job
[1:20:03] what about my career what am i going to
[1:20:05] do for a living what about my house
[1:20:08] and it's not that humanly speaking these
[1:20:10] aren't legitimate questions
[1:20:12] but if you know that the leading is from
[1:20:15] god just rest in knowing that he did it
[1:20:17] once he'll do it again
[1:20:20] he blessed you in business once he'll
[1:20:22] bless you again he opened the door for
[1:20:24] you once he'll open a door for you again
[1:20:27] who was it that did all that for you
[1:20:30] if you think it's you you won't want to
[1:20:31] let go but when you recognize it's him
[1:20:33] you can say here it is lord take it i
[1:20:36] know you'll pour it out on me more
[1:20:37] abundantly next time i know wherever you
[1:20:40] lead me you got something better for me
[1:20:42] it's him that brought you to this point
[1:20:44] to begin with i promise you he'll
[1:20:47] continue to provide just like he always
[1:20:49] has if you're following the leadership
[1:20:52] of the holy spirit
[1:20:56] even when we can't see
[1:20:58] why or we can't see where
[1:21:02] or we can't see how
[1:21:08] that's where trust comes into it
[1:21:11] that's our focus tonight allowing him to
[1:21:14] lead when you don't understand
[1:21:17] allowing him to lead when it makes no
[1:21:20] sense
[1:21:21] staying focused on the promised land
[1:21:23] when you come to the red sea
[1:21:25] staying focused on the promised land
[1:21:27] when you're out of food and you're out
[1:21:28] of water he said he was taking us there
[1:21:31] that's what i'm doing he's leading me
[1:21:33] there
[1:21:35] keep your eyes on the promised land like
[1:21:36] it says in philippians 3 press towards
[1:21:38] the mark of the high calling
[1:21:41] one interpretation of that says press
[1:21:42] towards the mark of the upward call of
[1:21:45] god
[1:21:46] i love that press towards the mark of
[1:21:48] come up higher press towards the mark of
[1:21:50] there's a rapture it's an upward call
[1:21:52] keep your eye on that and press towards
[1:21:54] that mark the call to come up the call
[1:21:56] to go home
[1:21:58] that's where we have to keep our focus
[1:22:00] because when that isn't your focus you
[1:22:02] will begin to drift
[1:22:05] you will begin to look on how can i be
[1:22:07] successful here how can i make my life
[1:22:09] comfortable here how can i make sure i
[1:22:12] attain everything i need here
[1:22:15] now just because of that that doesn't
[1:22:16] mean you'll always
[1:22:18] quit church you may never miss a service
[1:22:21] but what are you putting in and what are
[1:22:23] you getting out
[1:22:26] what are you there for
[1:22:28] we have to approach every service with
[1:22:29] the sincerity that a meeting with the
[1:22:31] king of kings deserves
[1:22:33] but when you get to drifting it just
[1:22:35] becomes going to church because we're
[1:22:37] going to church because it's what we do
[1:22:40] we sing for a little while and hopefully
[1:22:41] it's songs i like
[1:22:45] i hope the piano is not too loud
[1:22:49] i hope the air conditioner set right and
[1:22:52] then we're going to have preaching
[1:22:54] brother aaron can never get done in an
[1:22:56] hour on wednesday night
[1:22:58] when's brother timothy going to get home
[1:23:03] tonight you're welcome
[1:23:06] he said praise the lord i heard you
[1:23:11] but that's the things we begin to focus
[1:23:13] on when you're going to church just
[1:23:14] because you're supposed to go to church
[1:23:17] because it's
[1:23:18] what you do
[1:23:20] oh
[1:23:21] i hope it's not hide burning tonight
[1:23:24] i hope it's not too long tonight you
[1:23:26] know a lot of people that follow this
[1:23:27] message would not have liked to sit in
[1:23:28] brother brano's meetings
[1:23:31] they act like they love the prophet get
[1:23:33] mad any time they come to church and
[1:23:34] there's any kind of correction
[1:23:36] have you listened to any tapes
[1:23:41] they are long
[1:23:43] and often times harsh
[1:23:46] and many of us would have struggled
[1:23:51] have we forgotten
[1:23:52] that correction begins in the house of
[1:23:54] god
[1:23:56] we should come with the attitude of lord
[1:23:58] if you correct me i will accept it
[1:24:00] i will take whatever you have for me
[1:24:02] tonight lord i will take whatever comes
[1:24:05] but when church just becomes something
[1:24:06] that you go to because you're supposed
[1:24:08] to be there these things become your
[1:24:10] focus
[1:24:12] instead of god i need you to lead me
[1:24:14] tonight god in this moment may you
[1:24:16] anoint the man of god to speak what it
[1:24:18] is i have need of tonight god i need a
[1:24:20] word tonight god i need direction
[1:24:22] tonight i need you to lift me up tonight
[1:24:24] i need you tonight lord i'm here tonight
[1:24:27] to be led however long the service is
[1:24:29] whatever said whatever song god i'm here
[1:24:32] because i need you tonight i'm coming to
[1:24:34] meet you tonight i'm here lord to have a
[1:24:37] conference with you nothing else matters
[1:24:39] tonight
[1:24:40] that's why we come to the house of god
[1:24:43] to be led into his presence
[1:24:45] i just want to find your will for my
[1:24:47] life i want to focus on staying
[1:24:50] underneath your leadership
[1:24:52] that's why we come to the house of god
[1:24:54] to reconnect and stay connected with
[1:24:56] that still small voice
[1:25:02] let's all take inventory tonight and
[1:25:04] look and see where are you being led
[1:25:10] what voice
[1:25:11] are you following
[1:25:13] where are you going
[1:25:15] is it drawing you and your family into a
[1:25:17] closer walk
[1:25:19] in your spiritual walk is it leading you
[1:25:21] back to pentecost or is it leading you
[1:25:23] to a dead dry dull experience
[1:25:26] if that's where you're at don't stop
[1:25:28] there
[1:25:29] nobody's saying you're lost nobody's
[1:25:30] saying i'm just saying don't stop there
[1:25:32] keep on going keep on pressing press on
[1:25:34] to the upper room
[1:25:36] we have to continue following the spirit
[1:25:37] wherever it is that spirit would lead
[1:25:39] you
[1:25:40] sometimes we don't understand many times
[1:25:43] we don't understand
[1:25:44] it's more than sometimes it's many times
[1:25:46] we don't understand
[1:25:48] and oftentimes we'll find ourselves in
[1:25:49] wonderful places
[1:25:52] in the midst of wonderful blessings
[1:25:54] and we get so comfortable there and we
[1:25:56] want to stay right there but then the
[1:25:58] spirit moves and you're like
[1:26:00] but i like this
[1:26:03] lord you were blessing me lord i know i
[1:26:05] was where i was supposed to be you were
[1:26:06] where you were supposed to be remember
[1:26:08] it's a walk
[1:26:10] you were where you're supposed to be but
[1:26:11] if he moves and you stay you are now no
[1:26:14] longer where you're supposed to be
[1:26:16] you have to be willing to move when the
[1:26:18] spirit moves even if it's taking you to
[1:26:21] the red sea
[1:26:23] even if it's taking you to a wilderness
[1:26:24] if that's where the spirit's leading you
[1:26:27] better go
[1:26:30] the israelites would camp down when the
[1:26:32] pillar of fire stopped
[1:26:34] and yet they were told don't drive your
[1:26:35] tent stakes too deep
[1:26:37] because when the pillar of fire moves
[1:26:39] you got to go with it
[1:26:41] you could be one day in the presence of
[1:26:43] the pillar of fire and if you stayed one
[1:26:45] day too long you were left behind a
[1:26:47] sheep without a shepherd stuck in the
[1:26:49] wilderness ready to be devoured
[1:26:51] you had to move when the holy spirit
[1:26:53] moved you had to move when the pillar of
[1:26:56] fire moved
[1:26:57] otherwise you're left
[1:26:59] we got to refocus tonight
[1:27:01] refocus tonight and look back to the
[1:27:03] high call
[1:27:04] refocus tonight to the call that says
[1:27:06] come up higher go a little further and
[1:27:09] let's remember tonight wherever you're
[1:27:11] at whatever you're trying to accomplish
[1:27:12] whatever trial you're in you must be led
[1:27:15] of the holy spirit and no matter where
[1:27:17] you're at he said i will take you out
[1:27:19] and i will take you in i know i've got
[1:27:21] what you i need to know my future you're
[1:27:23] going to make it
[1:27:25] i need to know my future you're going to
[1:27:27] be there i need to know my future the
[1:27:29] rapture is for you that's all i can tell
[1:27:31] you but let that anchor down in your
[1:27:33] soul tonight that's enough for me
[1:27:36] that's the future i care about
[1:27:42] we have to recognize that we're sheep
[1:27:43] even when things are bad
[1:27:46] see that's what happened with nathan and
[1:27:47] cora
[1:27:48] they didn't want to be sheep anymore
[1:27:50] they wanted to be shepherds
[1:27:53] and as long as blessings was flowing and
[1:27:55] things was their liking and they
[1:27:57] they got things the way they wanted
[1:27:59] things and they were okay playing the
[1:28:00] part of a sheep
[1:28:02] they were okay playing that part but in
[1:28:04] the trial they could no longer trust
[1:28:08] that's what separates a real believer
[1:28:11] can you still trust him in the trial
[1:28:15] can you still give him your everything
[1:28:16] in the trial
[1:28:18] and they rose up against the leadership
[1:28:20] of the spirit and they began to
[1:28:21] influence others in the congregation to
[1:28:23] do the same thing and god said separate
[1:28:25] yourself
[1:28:26] i'ma swallow them all up
[1:28:28] separate yourself from unbelief separate
[1:28:31] yourself from doubt separate yourself
[1:28:33] from those things and say lord i'm
[1:28:35] trusting in your leadership i'm trusting
[1:28:37] that you said you're my healer you said
[1:28:40] you're my deliverer you said you'd be my
[1:28:42] shepherd you said you'd lead me into
[1:28:44] green pastures you said lord i'm not
[1:28:46] looking to man i'm looking to you lord
[1:28:48] you said tonight you said it and so
[1:28:51] that's where my trust lies
[1:28:53] so many people any little bump in the
[1:28:55] road comes up and we want to look here
[1:28:57] for a way out and we want to look there
[1:28:58] for a way out look here for a leader
[1:29:00] look there for a leader just stand still
[1:29:03] tonight and see the salvation of the
[1:29:05] lord in your life
[1:29:06] don't be so quick to run off and be and
[1:29:09] be scattered stand still and trust that
[1:29:12] the shepherd's gonna take you exactly
[1:29:14] where he said he's gonna take you to
[1:29:16] but you gotta lay your will down you
[1:29:18] gotta lay your ideas down you gotta lay
[1:29:21] down your own desires tonight and submit
[1:29:25] submit to his leadership
[1:29:29] look even in the worst of days the
[1:29:31] pillar of fire was there
[1:29:34] even in the worst of days the rock
[1:29:36] followed them
[1:29:38] look we can testify to the same church
[1:29:41] it's never left us
[1:29:43] it's never less of we still see the
[1:29:44] healings we still see people filled with
[1:29:46] the holy ghost we still see the sinners
[1:29:48] called to repentance we still see the
[1:29:50] pillar of fire in our midst doing the
[1:29:52] works that he promised he would do
[1:29:54] even on the worst of days the pillar of
[1:29:56] fire is amongst us
[1:29:58] why do i want to be led somewhere else
[1:30:00] or lead here or lead there the pillar of
[1:30:02] fire vindicated this message the pillar
[1:30:04] of fire vindicated this prophet and i'm
[1:30:07] going to put my trust in the lord and
[1:30:09] i'm going to follow it he's going to
[1:30:10] lead me all the way
[1:30:17] problem is there was a trust issue with
[1:30:19] nathan and core
[1:30:20] they forgot what god had done church we
[1:30:22] can't forget what god has done
[1:30:25] they forgot that he never failed and
[1:30:27] when they forgot they looked elsewhere
[1:30:29] for leadership
[1:30:30] look those that didn't make it over
[1:30:33] on the exodus
[1:30:35] could never blame the leadership
[1:30:39] they could never blame moses
[1:30:42] they could never blame aaron
[1:30:45] the pillar of fire was there visible
[1:30:46] vindicating their ministry every single
[1:30:48] day
[1:30:49] if they didn't make it over it's because
[1:30:51] they chose not to be led over
[1:30:55] because men
[1:30:57] humanity
[1:30:59] humans
[1:31:00] have a hard time being sheep
[1:31:04] we have a hard time submitting
[1:31:07] brother brown says see that's just the
[1:31:08] nature of man he wants his own way
[1:31:11] and god did not make man to desire his
[1:31:13] own way god made man to depend on him to
[1:31:15] forsake his ways to crucify crucify his
[1:31:18] way he likened us unto sheep and the
[1:31:20] sheep is one animal that cannot find his
[1:31:22] own way he must be led a little lamb can
[1:31:25] lose himself from the fold and he's just
[1:31:27] totally lost he just stands there and
[1:31:29] bleats
[1:31:30] and that's the way it is with the human
[1:31:32] being if he becomes a lamb if his nature
[1:31:35] is changed he depends wholly upon god
[1:31:37] and upon god's leading
[1:31:40] church i choose to be a sheep tonight
[1:31:43] i choose to be a lamb tonight
[1:31:46] but we all no matter who we are have to
[1:31:48] learn the importance of leadership the
[1:31:50] prophet had to learn how to be led
[1:31:52] we know how that early on in his
[1:31:54] ministry how the lord led him a certain
[1:31:56] way and he went a different way and how
[1:31:58] he paid for it dearly
[1:32:00] we know how later on he wanted to just
[1:32:02] be a mountain man and go up in the
[1:32:03] mountains and do what he wanted to do
[1:32:05] and when god would give him a message he
[1:32:06] would come down and preach
[1:32:08] he had to learn to lay all those things
[1:32:10] aside
[1:32:11] he had to learn to totally submit and be
[1:32:13] led by the spirit of god
[1:32:16] so i ask you tonight
[1:32:18] why are you where you are tonight
[1:32:23] i don't mean an evening like tabernacle
[1:32:25] necessarily or if you want to apply it
[1:32:27] that way that's fine
[1:32:29] but why are you where you are
[1:32:32] did you end up in that spot according to
[1:32:33] your own wonderings
[1:32:36] are you where the lord has brought you
[1:32:38] are you listening for further leadership
[1:32:42] what doest thou
[1:32:44] hear
[1:32:46] that's what the lord said to elijah when
[1:32:48] he spoke to him in the still small voice
[1:32:50] what doest thou
[1:32:53] have you stopped progressing
[1:32:55] have you stopped taking ground
[1:32:58] or does this service find you right in
[1:32:59] step exactly where you need to be
[1:33:02] the holy spirit leading on
[1:33:04] the holy spirit leading the bride to
[1:33:05] victory leading you to victory hopefully
[1:33:07] we find ourselves marching in that
[1:33:09] walking in that walking according to
[1:33:11] leadership but if you find yourself
[1:33:13] standing still get back in step if you
[1:33:15] find yourself struggling there's grace
[1:33:17] and mercy here for you tonight this is
[1:33:19] by no means a message of condemnation is
[1:33:21] saying he wants to lead you just give
[1:33:23] him your hand say lord here i am lead me
[1:33:25] guide me i'll go where you tell me to go
[1:33:27] i will stop where you tell me to stop
[1:33:29] i'll dig up tent stakes when you tell me
[1:33:30] to dig them up all i know is i know
[1:33:32] where you're going and that's where i
[1:33:34] want to go so lord take my hand and lead
[1:33:36] me there tonight wherever it finds you
[1:33:39] as sheep we must follow him daily and
[1:33:42] check daily to make sure that we're
[1:33:44] being led by the spirit because that is
[1:33:46] what's leading to victory only those
[1:33:49] following the spirit of god are going to
[1:33:51] find themselves victorious in that day
[1:33:53] are we being drawn deeper into the word
[1:33:56] are we being drawn closer to god
[1:33:59] does this job i won't fit into what god
[1:34:01] has for me spiritually
[1:34:03] does this relationship fit into what god
[1:34:05] has for me as a christian
[1:34:08] do my actions declare that there is a
[1:34:10] holy god leading me
[1:34:15] listen to this quote
[1:34:16] your conduct and your dress and your
[1:34:19] manner of conversation and your
[1:34:21] entertainment and all these things
[1:34:23] declared the leadership you were
[1:34:25] following
[1:34:28] if it don't line up to the word you
[1:34:30] aren't following him because he is the
[1:34:32] word
[1:34:33] said they have eyes but they can't see
[1:34:35] ears and can't hear how thankful you
[1:34:37] should be church how you should
[1:34:39] straighten yourself up from these things
[1:34:41] how you should be on fire for god that
[1:34:43] your eyes behold what you see in your
[1:34:45] ears here's the things you see

[1:37:03] brother branham says god has a new birth
[1:37:05] for you but listen to a still small
[1:37:07] voice every one of you people who
[1:37:09] profess to be christians get yourself
[1:37:11] quiet before him don't let the washing
[1:37:13] hinder don't let the work hinder don't
[1:37:16] let nothing hinder don't let nobody know
[1:37:18] what you're doing just go before him get
[1:37:20] up in the woods somewhere get out on the
[1:37:22] side of the road go into a secret cause
[1:37:24] and close the door when the kids get at
[1:37:26] school they'll get down on your knees
[1:37:28] you've heard all kinds of voices
[1:37:30] everywhere but just get down and stay
[1:37:32] there until those voices are silenced
[1:37:34] and you begin to lift up it'll change
[1:37:36] you
[1:37:37] he says it'll make you different like it
[1:37:39] did a little samuel it'll do something
[1:37:41] to make you if you'll just do it now
[1:37:43] it'll make you what you should be
[1:37:45] it'll make you the kind of christian you
[1:37:47] ought to be
[1:37:48] no matter if you're a farmer if you're a
[1:37:50] shoe cobbler whatever you may be god
[1:37:53] still speaks if you're a sinner if
[1:37:56] you're a prostitute harlot if you're a
[1:37:58] drunkard if you're a local church member
[1:38:00] nominal whatever you might be the voice
[1:38:03] of god still waits to speak to you
[1:38:08] he still waits to speak to you he wants
[1:38:10] to speak to you tonight and he wants to
[1:38:12] lead you tonight and he wants to lead
[1:38:14] you tomorrow but he needs somebody
[1:38:15] willing to submit and say lord
[1:38:17] i'll be led
[1:38:19] i'll be led tonight
[1:38:23] we started off at the beginning of this
[1:38:25] we were dealing with distractions
[1:38:27] explaining that just because you hit a
[1:38:29] hard trial doesn't mean that god isn't
[1:38:31] leading
[1:38:35] just because things are going bad don't
[1:38:36] lose focus
[1:38:39] you just remember
[1:38:40] you're being led to victory
[1:38:43] you must remember that the god who
[1:38:44] promised to bring you out promised to
[1:38:46] take you in
[1:38:47] and that god has got it all
[1:38:50] in control
[1:38:52] and when we really believe that that's
[1:38:54] when we can have rest when we truly
[1:38:56] believe that no matter what it looks
[1:38:58] like no matter where it looks like he's
[1:39:00] leading us he's got it all in control
[1:39:04] lord i don't know why we're going down
[1:39:05] this path i i don't know why it looks
[1:39:07] like we're heading towards the red sea
[1:39:09] why there's mountains on either side of
[1:39:11] us how are we going to escape listen
[1:39:13] he's not in the business of leading his
[1:39:15] children to defeat our god isn't in the
[1:39:18] business of planting defeated battles
[1:39:20] and
[1:39:21] and going and taking you here and taking
[1:39:23] you there just so you can fall in the
[1:39:24] wilderness that's not what our god does
[1:39:27] he's not in the business of bringing you
[1:39:29] out and leaving you halfway he didn't
[1:39:31] bring us this far to leave us he didn't
[1:39:34] bring us out here just to let us die he
[1:39:36] didn't lead through the protestant
[1:39:38] reformation and down through
[1:39:40] luther and wesley and pentecost in the
[1:39:42] message of malachi 4 and brother branham
[1:39:44] he didn't do all those things to get to
[1:39:46] this point and then just go
[1:39:48] i'm done
[1:39:50] good luck
[1:39:52] that's not the way our god operates the
[1:39:55] shepherd brought you this far to take
[1:39:57] you all the way the shepherd brought you
[1:39:59] this far for victory i'll say it like
[1:40:01] this the shepherd brought them to the
[1:40:03] red sea so they might have the greatest
[1:40:06] victory they'd ever known it may not
[1:40:08] have looked like it it may not have
[1:40:10] looked like it but i can see as brother
[1:40:11] timothy said when god laid out the earth
[1:40:14] and he put a mountain here in a mountain
[1:40:16] there in an ocean there he said i'm
[1:40:18] doing that because one day i'm going to
[1:40:20] bring my people right there to have the
[1:40:22] greatest victory they've ever had why am
[1:40:25] i where i'm at tonight brother aaron
[1:40:27] he's brought you to victory he's brought
[1:40:30] you to a place you can have the greatest
[1:40:32] victory you've ever had in your life it
[1:40:35] looks bad that the enemy's coming good
[1:40:38] come on it's a trap it's a trap come on
[1:40:41] in this is a place of victory for you
[1:40:45] he's not in the business of leading you
[1:40:47] to a defeat
[1:40:53] and when pharaoh drew nah
[1:40:56] you know it probably wasn't easy to be a
[1:40:57] sheep in that moment
[1:40:59] and a lot of them failed at it
[1:41:02] they got pretty upset
[1:41:04] the children of israel lifted up their
[1:41:06] eyes and behold the egyptians marched
[1:41:08] after them and they were sore afraid
[1:41:10] the children of israel cried out unto
[1:41:12] the lord
[1:41:13] and they said unto moses because there
[1:41:14] were no graves in egypt
[1:41:16] has thou taken us away to die in the
[1:41:18] wilderness
[1:41:19] wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us
[1:41:22] to carry us forth out of egypt
[1:41:25] is it not this the word that we did tell
[1:41:26] thee in egypt saying let us alone that
[1:41:28] we may serve the egyptians
[1:41:30] for it had been better for us to serve
[1:41:31] the egyptians
[1:41:33] that we might
[1:41:34] we should die in the wilderness
[1:41:38] and moses said unto the people
[1:41:40] fear ye not
[1:41:41] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:41:44] lord which he will show to you
[1:41:46] today for the egyptians who you have
[1:41:48] seen today you shall see them again no
[1:41:50] more forever the lord shall fight for
[1:41:53] you and you shall hold your peace
[1:41:58] look we're going to put it bluntly he
[1:41:59] said you're going to shut up
[1:42:02] you're not going to talk anymore
[1:42:04] you said enough negativity stand still
[1:42:07] for a moment and watch what my god's
[1:42:08] going to do because when my god shows up
[1:42:11] things happen when my god shows up the
[1:42:12] sick are healed young people and old
[1:42:14] people alike are filled with the holy
[1:42:16] ghost when my god shows up demons are
[1:42:18] cast out there's freedom in the house of
[1:42:20] god the bound get delivered hang on just
[1:42:22] a minute my god's gonna fight for you
[1:42:24] because he's the one that led you here
[1:42:26] stand still our god's about to go to
[1:42:28] battle our god's about to set us free
[1:42:30] our god's about to crush the enemy our
[1:42:33] god's about to go to war
[1:42:35] and when he goes to war it's always a
[1:42:38] victory
[1:42:42] we're going to bring this down now to a
[1:42:44] close
[1:42:46] very briefly
[1:42:50] he isn't leading you somewhere in order
[1:42:52] for you to die
[1:42:55] his leadership is always
[1:42:57] to life
[1:42:59] you just keep walking with god you've
[1:43:01] been walking with god you keep walking
[1:43:02] with god he's leading you to victory he
[1:43:04] hasn't let us here to be destroyed
[1:43:07] he hasn't led us here to lose he's led
[1:43:09] us here for victory when the negativity
[1:43:11] hits
[1:43:12] keep letting him lead
[1:43:14] when the blessings hit you keep letting
[1:43:16] him lead
[1:43:18] when the trials come and the heartaches
[1:43:19] come and people raise up and question
[1:43:22] the leadership of the holy ghost you
[1:43:23] just keep letting him lead you let him
[1:43:26] lead you out of sin you let him lead you
[1:43:28] out of bondage you let him lead you all
[1:43:29] the way to the holy ghost you let him
[1:43:30] lead you all the way to the rapture let
[1:43:33] him lead
[1:43:34] exodus 15 13 says thou in thy mercy has
[1:43:38] led forth the people which thou hast
[1:43:39] redeemed thou hast guided them in thy
[1:43:42] strength unto thy holy habitation
[1:43:46] although that sounds wonderful
[1:43:48] but there was a lot of awful things that
[1:43:50] took place in that verse i didn't
[1:43:51] written about
[1:43:53] and yet he was still guiding those that
[1:43:55] he had redeemed guiding them in his
[1:43:58] strength guiding them to the holy
[1:44:00] habitation it doesn't mention all the
[1:44:02] hardships listen the easy road is
[1:44:04] usually the wrong road
[1:44:08] on this journey there's going to be
[1:44:09] trials keep walking with the shepherd
[1:44:13] there was a red sea he opened it there
[1:44:15] was hunger he rained manna there was
[1:44:17] thirst he brought water out of a rock
[1:44:20] there was serpents biting him he raised
[1:44:22] up the brass serpent
[1:44:23] he met every need they had every trial
[1:44:26] they came to they fought wars he was the
[1:44:29] chief captain
[1:44:31] what do i got to do tonight brother
[1:44:32] aaron submit
[1:44:34] submit your will and say lord i'm
[1:44:36] willing to be led i'm willing to let you
[1:44:38] have control
[1:44:40] don't be afraid to stop
[1:44:42] to get back and listen for that still
[1:44:44] small voice
[1:44:45] listen for him to speak
[1:44:47] the difficulty of the trial doesn't
[1:44:48] matter when it's him that's leading you
[1:44:51] how ridiculous things can look to our
[1:44:53] human eyes doesn't matter when it's him
[1:44:55] leading you
[1:44:56] listen
[1:44:58] i know we're going over into the
[1:45:00] promised land but when you look at it
[1:45:02] naturally the battle plan to take
[1:45:03] jericho
[1:45:07] it's not real good
[1:45:11] tell you what we're going to do we're
[1:45:12] going to walk around this city and we're
[1:45:13] not going to say nothing
[1:45:15] then we're going to shout and these
[1:45:17] walls are going to fall
[1:45:19] if you weren't a spiritual person yeah
[1:45:21] they are
[1:45:24] but when he's leading you
[1:45:26] and you've learned that you can trust
[1:45:28] him it doesn't matter how ridiculous it
[1:45:30] seems to these eyes lord you haven't
[1:45:32] failed me before you opened a red sea
[1:45:34] that i didn't think could be open he's
[1:45:36] done things for you that you didn't
[1:45:37] think could be done he's made ways in
[1:45:39] situations that you couldn't believe
[1:45:41] healings you can't explain financial
[1:45:43] situations you can't explain money
[1:45:45] dropped in the bank the day you needed
[1:45:47] it things that have happened children
[1:45:48] come back he's done things you can't
[1:45:50] explain so when you come to another
[1:45:52] situation you come up against another
[1:45:54] wall you say lord i don't know how but i
[1:45:56] know he's going to make a way he'll make
[1:45:58] a way because he said he would he'll
[1:46:00] make a way because he's a god that's not
[1:46:02] going to leave you stuck in the
[1:46:03] wilderness he's going to make a way
[1:46:05] through every trial
[1:46:06] lord why'd you bring us to the jordan
[1:46:08] river at the height of flood season
[1:46:11] why can't why
[1:46:12] why because he was going to show the
[1:46:14] same god that piled up the waters of the
[1:46:16] red sea he's going to pile up the waters
[1:46:18] of the jordan and you're going to walk
[1:46:20] across once again on dry land what he's
[1:46:23] done for you in the past he's going to
[1:46:24] do it again he's going to stop the
[1:46:26] situation for you again he's going to
[1:46:28] open up a passageway for you again
[1:46:30] that's my god and i say lord lead me
[1:46:34] take my hand lord lead me all the way
[1:46:36] the promise let i submit all that i am
[1:46:39] unto you
[1:46:42] we have to let him lead tonight
[1:46:44] we have to let go
[1:46:46] deuteronomy 8 15 who led thee through
[1:46:49] the great and terrible wilderness
[1:46:51] wherein there were fiery serpents and
[1:46:53] scorpions and drought where there was no
[1:46:56] water who brought thee forth water out
[1:46:58] of the rock
[1:46:59] of flint
[1:47:01] church who is it that's brought you this
[1:47:02] far
[1:47:05] who brought you out
[1:47:07] it was him
[1:47:10] it's jesus is why you're here tonight
[1:47:14] and it's jesus that's gonna see you all
[1:47:16] the way through
[1:47:19] musicians you can
[1:47:20] come and we talked a little bit sunday
[1:47:23] about
[1:47:25] we don't look to a natural patriarch and
[1:47:27] their characteristics
[1:47:29] we're not looking to one of
[1:47:32] those that had a negative prophecy spoke
[1:47:34] over but we can look to the
[1:47:35] characteristics of the lord jesus
[1:47:37] and he's never asked you to do something
[1:47:39] that he himself didn't do
[1:47:43] he knows how to be led
[1:47:47] he doesn't ask you to go through trials
[1:47:48] that he didn't face
[1:47:50] matter of fact he took things so you
[1:47:52] wouldn't have to
[1:47:54] he knows what it's like to be a lamb
[1:47:57] to be led
[1:47:58] to lay down his own will
[1:48:01] prophet of god says i want you to notice
[1:48:02] what kind of a lamb this was
[1:48:04] this lamb a lamb has to be led and this
[1:48:08] precious land that we're thinking about
[1:48:09] he was led not my will but thine be done
[1:48:13] led to the slaughter
[1:48:15] sometimes someone said why was jesus led
[1:48:18] to the calvary
[1:48:19] you know the bible said they led him
[1:48:21] away they put a rope around his neck and
[1:48:23] led him away why because he was a lamb
[1:48:25] of god
[1:48:26] why he was born in a manger because he
[1:48:29] was a lamb he had to be born in the barn
[1:48:31] he was a lamb born the lamb and led
[1:48:35] to the slaughter
[1:48:38] led where
[1:48:40] led to your victory
[1:48:43] jesus allowed himself to be led for your
[1:48:46] victory
[1:48:47] led to calvary
[1:48:49] so that you could overcome
[1:48:51] and now what we're saying tonight is
[1:48:54] let him lead you to that same calvary
[1:48:57] let him lead you to the holy ghost let
[1:48:59] him lead you through this trial that
[1:49:00] you're battling let him lead you through
[1:49:02] tomorrow and all the days after that in
[1:49:04] the weeks and the months
[1:49:06] let him lead you all the way home
[1:49:09] don't stop short
[1:49:11] the leading went all the way across into
[1:49:13] the promised land
[1:49:14] i want to say tonight lord
[1:49:16] i want to be led by your spirit
[1:49:19] lord lead me and i'll follow
[1:49:22] lord take my hand
[1:49:24] and i'll just submit all my will
[1:49:26] i'll lay down what i think
[1:49:28] and i'll put my trust in you and i'll
[1:49:30] allow you to lead me
[1:49:33] oh there's so much
[1:49:34] if you'll let me i want to read one more
[1:49:36] quote
[1:49:41] it says but here comes moses a faithful
[1:49:43] servant who esteemed the reproach of
[1:49:44] christ greater treasures than all the
[1:49:46] riches of egypt
[1:49:48] he come to the end of the road an old
[1:49:49] man
[1:49:50] 120 years old walked up on the mountain
[1:49:54] he know that death laid before him and
[1:49:57] he looked over into the promised land
[1:49:59] and he looked laying there by his side
[1:50:01] and there was his leader
[1:50:03] the rock
[1:50:05] he stepped up on the rock and the angels
[1:50:08] of god packed him away into glory
[1:50:10] the glory of god into the bosom of god
[1:50:12] why
[1:50:14] 800 years later he was still being led
[1:50:16] by his leader
[1:50:17] we find him over on mount
[1:50:19] transfiguration standing there with
[1:50:20] elijah talking to jesus before he went
[1:50:22] to the cross 800 years after death
[1:50:26] the one that he had esteemed the
[1:50:27] reproach of his ministry greater
[1:50:29] treasures and all the popularity of the
[1:50:31] world all the money of the world his
[1:50:33] leader was still leading him
[1:50:36] oh my he was led his leader he led him
[1:50:40] through death the shadows of death he
