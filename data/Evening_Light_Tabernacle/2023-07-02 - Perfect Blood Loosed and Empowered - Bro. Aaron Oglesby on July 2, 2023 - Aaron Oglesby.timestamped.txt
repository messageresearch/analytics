[58:02] would go in a way Lord that would Lord
[58:05] give us confidence to know that we found
[58:07] the mind of God for this service
[58:10] Lord I ask that you'll just take
[58:11] complete control speak to every heart
[58:13] Lord May every doubt and every fear and
[58:15] every unbelief be driven out Lord by the
[58:18] word today Lord

[59:15] Lord and with your presence and your
[59:17] anointing we thank you in Jesus name we
[59:19] pray
[59:22] amen if you have your Bibles with you
[59:25] I'd like you to
[59:28] turn with me to the book of Hebrews
[59:32] the 10th chapter
[59:41] and we're going to read verses
[59:43] 1 through 18.
[59:49] it says for the law having a shadow of
[59:52] good things to come
[59:54] and not the very image of the thing can
[59:57] never with those sacrifices which they
[59:59] offered year by year continually make
[1:00:02] the comers their unto perfect
[1:00:05] for then would they not have ceased to
[1:00:07] be offered because that the worshipers
[1:00:10] once purged should have had no more
[1:00:12] conscious of sins
[1:00:14] but in those sacrifices there is a
[1:00:16] remembrance again made of sins every
[1:00:19] year for it is not possible that the
[1:00:21] blood of bulls and goats should take
[1:00:23] away sins wherefore when he cometh into
[1:00:25] the world he say his sacrifice and
[1:00:27] offering thou wouldest not but a body
[1:00:30] hast thou prepared me in burnt offerings
[1:00:33] and sacrifices for sin thou has had no
[1:00:36] pleasure then said I lo I come and the
[1:00:39] volume of the book it is written of me
[1:00:40] to do thy will o God
[1:00:44] above when he said sacrifice and
[1:00:46] offering and burnt offerings and
[1:00:48] offering for sin thou wouldest not
[1:00:50] neither hath thou pleasure therein which
[1:00:52] are offered by the law then said he lo I
[1:00:55] come to do thy will o God he taketh away
[1:00:58] the first that he may establish the
[1:01:01] second
[1:01:02] by the which will we are Sanctified
[1:01:04] through the offering of the body of
[1:01:06] Jesus Christ once for all
[1:01:09] and every priest standeth daily
[1:01:10] ministering and offering oftentimes the
[1:01:12] same sacrifices which can never take
[1:01:15] away sins
[1:01:16] but this man after he had offered one
[1:01:19] sacrifice for sins forever set down on
[1:01:22] the right hand of God from henceforth
[1:01:24] expecting till his enemies be made his
[1:01:26] footstool for by one offering he hath
[1:01:29] perfected forever them that are
[1:01:31] Sanctified whereof the Holy Ghost also
[1:01:35] is a witness to us for after that he had
[1:01:38] said before this is the Covenant that I
[1:01:40] will make with them after those days
[1:01:42] saith the Lord I will put my laws into
[1:01:45] their heart and in their minds will I
[1:01:48] write them and their sins and iniquities
[1:01:51] will I remember no more
[1:01:53] now where remission of these is there is
[1:01:57] no more offering for sin amen I pray the
[1:02:00] Lord bless his word as you have your
[1:02:03] seats today wonderful words of life that
[1:02:06] we've read here
[1:02:07] recognizing that the sin question was
[1:02:10] dealt with once and for all by by one
[1:02:13] sacrifice are we all made perfect and
[1:02:16] we're going to be going through this and
[1:02:18] speaking on these scriptures today what
[1:02:21] Hebrews here is talking about
[1:02:23] obviously it seems simple is the is the
[1:02:26] sacrifice that Jesus has made that has
[1:02:29] broke the curse of sin on our lives once
[1:02:32] and for all and and it's referencing the
[1:02:35] sacrifices that have been made ritually
[1:02:37] down through the Old Testament ever
[1:02:39] since the fall and it's making it clear
[1:02:42] that those sacrifices had no power to
[1:02:47] redeem there was no redeeming power in
[1:02:50] the blood of bulls and goats and and it
[1:02:52] had no power to take away sin but this
[1:02:55] sacrifice of Jesus Christ has perfected
[1:02:59] us forever amen the the blood has
[1:03:02] settled the issue of sin once and for
[1:03:05] all and and we're going to look today at
[1:03:08] the need for this Blood
[1:03:11] and if I would title it I would say
[1:03:13] today perfect blood loosed and empowered
[1:03:17] perfect blood loosed and empowered and
[1:03:21] we may go through slow through some of
[1:03:23] this and maybe in some very Elementary
[1:03:26] things but I just want to drive this
[1:03:28] home today to the sacrifice is down
[1:03:30] through time since the fall had only
[1:03:33] been a temporary institution
[1:03:36] God never intended for them to be
[1:03:39] something that would continue on forever
[1:03:42] and ever and ever for one thing he
[1:03:45] didn't want them to continue on because
[1:03:47] they were completely insufficient in
[1:03:51] value to pay the price for Humanity
[1:03:54] they were in some ways
[1:03:57] their their value was so insufficient
[1:04:00] that God only looked at it as a
[1:04:02] placeholder as something to be there in
[1:04:05] the place of and because the human race
[1:04:07] had fallen
[1:04:09] God had placed man on the earth in Eden
[1:04:11] and and man was given Rule and and what
[1:04:14] I want to show here is the significance
[1:04:17] of the debt the significance of what was
[1:04:21] owed man was given dominion over the
[1:04:23] earth and the creatures of the earth man
[1:04:26] was the god of the Earth
[1:04:30] the Earth was God's work he had created
[1:04:32] it he had invested himself in it he had
[1:04:35] thought about each and every detail that
[1:04:38] it was something God had spent time on
[1:04:40] he loved this creation he had thought
[1:04:43] about it from every angle and and he
[1:04:45] loved it not only man was God's
[1:04:48] handiwork but all the creation was God's
[1:04:50] handiwork the Earth was God's work and
[1:04:53] he would come down in the cool of the
[1:04:55] evening and he would enjoy the company
[1:04:57] of man and he would enjoy his creation
[1:05:01] it was something that he loved and God
[1:05:04] looked over everything that he had made
[1:05:06] and he said it's good if God calls
[1:05:09] something good and by his standards it's
[1:05:12] something good then it was good amen he
[1:05:15] had spent all this time making it good
[1:05:17] and then he turns and he entrusted to
[1:05:21] man
[1:05:23] he puts it in the hand of man the thing
[1:05:25] that he loves and in his workmanship and
[1:05:28] and he says you rule over it
[1:05:30] you subdue it you take communion to me I
[1:05:34] trust you with my creation
[1:05:38] think about how awful the fall was
[1:05:41] we always look at it just in terms of
[1:05:43] man as we should because we are man but
[1:05:46] everything fail the trust failed the
[1:05:49] relationship fell man took all that God
[1:05:53] had made and he took all that God had
[1:05:55] done the workmanship of his hand the
[1:05:58] gentleness of the lion the harmony of
[1:06:00] nature the Bliss of eternal life the
[1:06:03] perfect communion between God and man
[1:06:06] and threw it all away
[1:06:09] and they didn't do this in ignorance it
[1:06:11] wasn't an accident like oh God I'm so
[1:06:13] sorry I didn't know
[1:06:15] man did this in direct Disobedience to
[1:06:18] the word of God because in Genesis 2 17
[1:06:20] it had told them but of the tree of the
[1:06:22] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[1:06:25] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[1:06:27] eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die
[1:06:31] it's written in pretty plain English it
[1:06:33] was spoken there there was nothing to
[1:06:35] debate there was nothing to wonder there
[1:06:37] was nothing of of a gray area they knew
[1:06:40] if we do this
[1:06:43] we're throwing it all away if we do this
[1:06:46] we're allowing death to come in and in
[1:06:48] that moment Eve made a decision to do
[1:06:50] this
[1:06:51] knowing and then and then Adam also
[1:06:54] taking her unto himself makes the same
[1:06:56] decision I'm throwing all of this away
[1:07:00] think of the debt that man owed God
[1:07:04] think about what he threw away Here and
[1:07:07] Now sin would rule
[1:07:09] because not just man fail everything
[1:07:12] fail
[1:07:16] the lamb could no longer lay down with
[1:07:18] the line
[1:07:20] there was death and sin nature and and
[1:07:22] death ruled and and sin nature not only
[1:07:25] now with manifest in the human race but
[1:07:28] the cruelty of nature itself would now
[1:07:31] be on full display throughout the world
[1:07:34] and there was a penalty to be paid there
[1:07:37] was a debt that was owed
[1:07:39] because as I said man had not only sold
[1:07:41] himself but all of creation into slavery
[1:07:44] and now Satan had rights on man
[1:07:47] Satan had rights on creation Satan had a
[1:07:51] claim on them
[1:07:52] and because of this because Satan now
[1:07:54] owned man sin and death were now the
[1:07:57] task Masters that would rule over the
[1:07:59] Earth
[1:08:00] and as we read in the word the law
[1:08:02] required death
[1:08:06] think of the burden of this debt because
[1:08:09] the law required death nothing Adam
[1:08:12] could do would ever pay it off
[1:08:15] nothing he could do to work it off
[1:08:19] think about this morning there's nothing
[1:08:20] you can do to repay God for what he's
[1:08:22] done for you
[1:08:24] there's nothing you can do it's not in
[1:08:26] the works you can do it's just in the
[1:08:28] mercy and Grace of almighty God we can
[1:08:30] lay our souls and say Lord I'll give you
[1:08:32] my life I know it's unworthy I know it's
[1:08:34] not enough but lord it's all I have to
[1:08:36] give at least give him all that you have
[1:08:38] to give
[1:08:40] Adam can never pay this off because
[1:08:43] death was the sentence
[1:08:45] but what we find right here early on is
[1:08:48] that one of the attributes of God
[1:08:50] is love
[1:08:52] one of his attributes is love and God is
[1:08:54] love and yet he also has to be just and
[1:08:58] the penalty was death so he couldn't
[1:09:00] just say you know I forgive you let's
[1:09:02] move on he is a just God and the law
[1:09:04] required death but love stepped in to
[1:09:08] make a way
[1:09:09] there had to be something that died the
[1:09:12] law said you have to die the law said in
[1:09:14] the day you eat thereof that day you die
[1:09:16] and yet love said I want to make a way
[1:09:18] but something has to die and the law
[1:09:20] says something has to die but Mercy says
[1:09:23] I want to make a way
[1:09:25] and God's torn there I'm so thankful
[1:09:27] that in my life when I went astray into
[1:09:29] sin and to death he the law required
[1:09:32] that I had to die but he said I want to
[1:09:34] make a way I want to make a way back
[1:09:38] and in this moment even though the law
[1:09:40] required death
[1:09:42] love stepped in to make a way
[1:09:45] Mercy stepped in and Grace stepped in
[1:09:47] when you should have died Mercy stepped
[1:09:50] in
[1:09:50] when you should have gone to Hell Grace
[1:09:53] stepped in when you were lost and
[1:09:55] without hope God couldn't stand the
[1:09:58] thought of being separated forever from
[1:10:00] his children
[1:10:01] he couldn't stand the thought of not
[1:10:03] having the fellowship with his children
[1:10:06] he had created them for this purpose he
[1:10:08] didn't want to be alone
[1:10:10] he didn't want to be by himself and now
[1:10:12] he's sitting there looking at this there
[1:10:14] they go I'm going to be alone again
[1:10:16] he wanted to be loved and he wanted to
[1:10:19] be worshiped and we find out right here
[1:10:21] in this moment that we serve a very
[1:10:23] determined God
[1:10:24] he is not going to give up on the plans
[1:10:27] that he has he's not going to throw it
[1:10:29] away and walk away and move on to
[1:10:30] something else I'm so thankful for that
[1:10:32] today he's not going to throw you away
[1:10:34] he's not going to move on to another
[1:10:36] person he's not going to move on from
[1:10:38] this bride he created you for a purpose
[1:10:41] you are to be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:10:44] and if he called you to that then he's
[1:10:46] not going to throw you away but he's
[1:10:48] going to see that you fulfilled the
[1:10:49] purpose that he created you for though
[1:10:52] you stumble though you fall though you
[1:10:54] go astray I'm not giving up on her I'm
[1:10:58] not giving up on them I created them for
[1:11:00] a purpose
[1:11:05] when others give up on you he won't
[1:11:08] when others turn their back on you he
[1:11:10] won't
[1:11:11] because he's determined that I'm going
[1:11:13] to have a bride
[1:11:15] we have to get our eyes today off of our
[1:11:17] failures get our eyes today off of our
[1:11:20] shortcomings and get them back onto the
[1:11:22] sacrifice that took the place of your
[1:11:25] shortcomings get them back on the
[1:11:27] sacrifice that took the place of every
[1:11:29] one of your sins every one of your
[1:11:31] trespasses and the blood of Calvary
[1:11:34] cries out to you this morning no matter
[1:11:36] where you're at I'm not giving up on you
[1:11:39] I'm not turning my back on you I'm not
[1:11:42] going to leave you where you're at this
[1:11:44] morning brother Aaron I've been
[1:11:46] struggling I don't know what to turn I
[1:11:48] feel like I'm failing I feel like I'm
[1:11:50] failing I'm not giving up on you I have
[1:11:54] made a way
[1:11:59] but the blood said something had to Die
[1:12:01] the law said something had to die it
[1:12:04] required blood
[1:12:05] and so he took a lamb and he kills it in
[1:12:08] their place
[1:12:10] and it allowed them to live for another
[1:12:12] day
[1:12:13] it allowed them to live for a space of
[1:12:15] time although now sin and death ruled in
[1:12:18] these mortal bodies
[1:12:21] brother Brown says God he covered all
[1:12:23] space in all time
[1:12:24] bottled down to four little letters l o
[1:12:29] v e
[1:12:31] love
[1:12:33] he could not stand
[1:12:35] to see his child depart from him
[1:12:38] you know the thought this comes to me as
[1:12:40] we speak on love is that's the thing
[1:12:42] that the devil can't understand
[1:12:45] that's the thing he'll never understand
[1:12:48] that may be the thing that you'll never
[1:12:50] understand about me and the way I deal
[1:12:52] with my children and I may never
[1:12:53] understand about you and the way you
[1:12:55] deal with your children because you have
[1:12:57] a love for them that I can't understand
[1:13:00] and I have a love for my children that
[1:13:02] you might not can understand and in that
[1:13:04] moment Satan says I got them it's
[1:13:07] destroyed it's finished they're mine
[1:13:09] forever oh he looked at you that way and
[1:13:12] he said I got them I got them in the
[1:13:14] clutches of sin they'll never be
[1:13:15] redeemed they'll never be restored I got
[1:13:18] them in my pawn shop they've turned
[1:13:20] their back on God they've walked away
[1:13:22] from his word they've walked away from
[1:13:24] his promises they're full of nothing but
[1:13:26] unbelief full of nothing but doubt full
[1:13:28] of nothing but fear but l o v e he says
[1:13:33] I got him but God says no I love them
[1:13:35] they're mine I won't walk away I won't
[1:13:38] leave them in your pawn shop the devil
[1:13:41] goes I don't understand they transgress
[1:13:43] your law he says but I love them
[1:13:53] he says I can hear him say wait just a
[1:13:55] minute Adam
[1:13:56] I will put enmity between the woman's
[1:13:59] seed and the serpent seed
[1:14:00] her heel shall bruise his head
[1:14:03] and his head shall bruise her heel
[1:14:06] promising
[1:14:08] a savior
[1:14:10] notice right here it didn't have
[1:14:11] anything to do with man
[1:14:14] it didn't say no Adam here's what you're
[1:14:16] going to have to do
[1:14:17] I'm gonna work it out to where you move
[1:14:19] like this and he said I
[1:14:22] will put enmity
[1:14:24] he takes the Covenant upon himself he
[1:14:26] takes it upon himself to be the Redeemer
[1:14:29] amen
[1:14:30] he says
[1:14:32] I will
[1:14:34] I'm going to come
[1:14:36] I'm gonna put enmity
[1:14:38] listen just hold on to that this morning
[1:14:41] he said I will come
[1:14:43] he said I will heal you he said I will
[1:14:46] deliver you not you have to do this and
[1:14:48] you have to do that and if you're good
[1:14:50] enough I will
[1:14:52] he said I will come and he came
[1:14:54] he said I'm going to come back and I'm
[1:14:56] telling you he's on his way if he said
[1:14:59] it just hold on to it this morning just
[1:15:01] be ready to receive it just put your
[1:15:03] trust in it
[1:15:06] blood was required and and so began the
[1:15:09] killing of millions of innocent animals
[1:15:12] as down through time their blood was
[1:15:15] offered up every year by every
[1:15:17] individual
[1:15:18] as a sacrifice for sin
[1:15:21] and yet no matter how many lambs they
[1:15:24] killed
[1:15:25] no matter how many bulls or how many
[1:15:27] sheep it could never do away with sin
[1:15:31] no matter what they did Sin and death
[1:15:33] still ruled brother Branham says now the
[1:15:35] only thing that the law did they know
[1:15:37] that an innocent substitute had to die
[1:15:40] for the guilty
[1:15:41] that's us
[1:15:43] we're the guilty
[1:15:45] that law began back in the Garden of
[1:15:47] Eden and now they would offer a sheep or
[1:15:50] a bullock or something and kill it throw
[1:15:52] the blood out on the Altar and so forth
[1:15:54] because it was a covering or a
[1:15:57] substitutionary offering but it could
[1:16:00] never take away sin because there's not
[1:16:03] strength enough now listen to this
[1:16:04] there's not strength enough in an
[1:16:07] animal's life to atone for a human life
[1:16:10] because greater is the human life than
[1:16:13] animal life
[1:16:15] and we began to recognize that the that
[1:16:18] that the sacrifice had to be of a
[1:16:20] certain value
[1:16:23] the animal life wasn't valuable enough
[1:16:25] this is scripture it tells us in Matthew
[1:16:27] 12 12 how much then is a man better than
[1:16:31] a sheep
[1:16:32] there is a greater value so so no sheep
[1:16:35] could ever pay the price of a lost man
[1:16:37] much less all of humanity
[1:16:42] all of mankind as a matter of fact you
[1:16:44] could kill all the sheep and it wouldn't
[1:16:45] equal one man
[1:16:47] and so the value doesn't add up the life
[1:16:50] in no way could could could in any way
[1:16:53] repair the injury that was done by man
[1:16:56] in no way could pay the debt in no way
[1:16:58] could it settle the issue of sin because
[1:17:00] it was only a shadow
[1:17:03] of things to come
[1:17:05] and the Apostle here in Hebrews 10
[1:17:07] begins to put the levitical law in its
[1:17:09] place
[1:17:10] and and what he's saying here is even
[1:17:12] though these sacrifices had been done by
[1:17:14] Divine appointment
[1:17:16] even though it had been the plan of God
[1:17:18] even though it had been the program of
[1:17:20] God they were only designed to cover sin
[1:17:23] until the true Lamb of God came to take
[1:17:26] away the sin of the world I'm so
[1:17:29] grateful today that my sins aren't just
[1:17:31] covered up I'm so grateful today that
[1:17:33] they're not still there and there's just
[1:17:34] a thin layer of paint on top of them but
[1:17:37] when he came he took away the sins of
[1:17:40] the world he did away with it he dropped
[1:17:42] it in his bleach and my sins went all
[1:17:44] the way back to their accuser and
[1:17:46] brother Brown says they hit the devil's
[1:17:48] Square on the head he Bears my sins this
[1:17:51] morning are you guilty today no sir he's
[1:17:54] guilty I'm righteous I am forgiven I am
[1:17:58] cold I think it not robbery to be equal
[1:18:00] with God because his blood has
[1:18:04] Sanctified me his blood has purified me
[1:18:07] I'm no longer guilty I'm Justified
[1:18:11] but there is a guilty one
[1:18:13] every sin I committed squarely on the
[1:18:15] head of the accuser this morning
[1:18:20] these Shadows were supposed to point
[1:18:22] people to Jesus
[1:18:25] the point of it was to point people to
[1:18:27] Jesus but what happened is the Jews fell
[1:18:29] in love with the shadow
[1:18:33] they fell in love with the Shadow and
[1:18:35] when the substance of the Shadow was
[1:18:37] sacrificed
[1:18:39] they still wanted the shadow
[1:18:42] the substance was there but they loved
[1:18:44] the shadow
[1:18:45] they had fell in love with their rituals
[1:18:47] and their forms
[1:18:49] and it's where many choose to operate at
[1:18:51] today is Under The Shadow
[1:18:56] and when you're under the shadow truths
[1:18:59] are not clearly discovered
[1:19:01] and they're surely not completely and
[1:19:04] fully enjoyed
[1:19:07] that's what the message came to do in
[1:19:09] this day is it revealed the substance of
[1:19:13] the Shadows
[1:19:15] it put a substance in front of you this
[1:19:17] is what this was talking about this is
[1:19:20] what all of this was about maybe you
[1:19:22] couldn't see it clear here you couldn't
[1:19:24] see it clear there listen you can put my
[1:19:26] shadow up on the wall and you can say
[1:19:28] that's a big guy
[1:19:31] but as brother Tim has showed us many
[1:19:33] times as the shadow gets closer and
[1:19:35] closer and closer and closer it becomes
[1:19:38] more defined more defined and more clear
[1:19:41] but no matter how close it gets it's
[1:19:44] still a shadow
[1:19:47] until it's revealed what it is making
[1:19:50] the shadow
[1:19:52] and then sometimes you were way off with
[1:19:54] the shadow you knew something was coming
[1:19:56] but you was way off
[1:20:00] but now here it stands the problem is
[1:20:02] many times when you were way off you're
[1:20:04] unwilling to come around and admit you
[1:20:06] were way off and you want to stick with
[1:20:07] your idea
[1:20:09] stick with what the shadow told you
[1:20:12] stick with that no no but I saw it I had
[1:20:14] a revelation this is what it was and
[1:20:15] he's standing there going it's okay if
[1:20:17] you didn't see me clearly here I am to
[1:20:20] reveal myself to you leave the shadow
[1:20:22] behind and come to the substance this
[1:20:25] morning
[1:20:27] leave the shadow of your ideas in the
[1:20:29] past and come to the reality of the
[1:20:31] revelation of this word
[1:20:35] we don't want to continue to worship
[1:20:36] under a shadow when substance is
[1:20:38] available
[1:20:40] like I said the Shadows were a little
[1:20:42] bit hazy and they're not clearly defined
[1:20:44] then it leaves room for interpretation
[1:20:46] and that's exactly why some people love
[1:20:49] the shadow
[1:20:52] they love the ability to debate they
[1:20:54] love the the ability to have their own
[1:20:57] idea and their own thought on the matter
[1:20:58] and as long as you're dealing with
[1:21:00] shadows who's to say they're wrong
[1:21:03] their idea your idea well this well that
[1:21:06] and they loved the debate and as long as
[1:21:08] they operate in Shadows
[1:21:11] then their opinion still has some
[1:21:13] validity
[1:21:14] their opinion still matters so you find
[1:21:17] people that love the prophecy
[1:21:20] but hate the Fulfillment
[1:21:23] they love the books and the tapes and
[1:21:25] God sent a prophet and the message and
[1:21:26] the message and when it starts to take
[1:21:28] skin on it they're like well how dare
[1:21:29] you
[1:21:32] because they love the prophecy but they
[1:21:34] don't like the Fulfillment they love the
[1:21:35] shadow but they don't love the substance
[1:21:37] amen
[1:21:39] so you find that people despite
[1:21:41] fulfillment look it's exactly what
[1:21:43] happened with the Pharisees
[1:21:45] it's exactly where the Pharisees were
[1:21:47] that they had the Shadows down perfectly
[1:21:50] they had the Shadows down better than
[1:21:53] anyone and they couldn't accept the
[1:21:55] substance of The Shadow
[1:21:57] there were volumes written about his
[1:21:59] coming
[1:22:00] entire chapters and books dedicated to
[1:22:03] the coming Messiah and they saw that and
[1:22:06] they followed that shadow perfectly and
[1:22:08] we sit back and say how in the world did
[1:22:11] they miss it
[1:22:13] how in the world it was so obvious you
[1:22:15] would think that he would have been
[1:22:16] welcomed you would think that he would
[1:22:19] have been received you would think that
[1:22:20] they would recognize him
[1:22:23] hey look we can't be too hard on them
[1:22:26] we have people sitting back still
[1:22:27] debating the very first doctrine of
[1:22:29] Jesus that you must be born again
[1:22:32] there's entire books and volumes and
[1:22:34] quotes upon quotes upon quotes of of
[1:22:36] that you must be born again there's
[1:22:39] quotes and volumes in the book that tell
[1:22:41] us how the holy spirit will act when it
[1:22:43] comes how it's going to do in the lives
[1:22:45] of people when it comes and yet we sit
[1:22:47] back sometimes and give it a reception
[1:22:49] that would make the reception the
[1:22:50] Pharisees gave Jesus seem warm
[1:22:53] you would think the Holy Spirit Come and
[1:22:55] we would recognize it you would think
[1:22:57] the Holy Spirit coming we would welcome
[1:22:59] it and we would say yes Lord Jesus pour
[1:23:02] it out I see it I see it that's the
[1:23:04] shadow but now it's here I read about it
[1:23:07] I've talked about it but now it's here
[1:23:09] and I want to welcome it but instead we
[1:23:10] sit back and go well
[1:23:12] I can't believe the Pharisees didn't
[1:23:14] recognize Jesus
[1:23:16] and then he moves through the place and
[1:23:18] you go emotion
[1:23:22] Pharisee
[1:23:27] and you don't welcome it and you don't
[1:23:28] recognize it you love the shadow you
[1:23:31] love talking about what it did in the
[1:23:33] upper room
[1:23:34] you love talking about what it did in in
[1:23:37] the ministry of the Prophet but what
[1:23:38] about when it tries to manifest here
[1:23:43] and the substance of it begins to move
[1:23:48] and they can't receive a substance
[1:23:53] so moving from that these animals the
[1:23:55] sacrifice of animal life
[1:23:57] could never make the worshipers perfect
[1:24:00] or as it says in Hebrews if it did make
[1:24:02] them perfect then they were coming into
[1:24:03] those sacrifices they wouldn't continue
[1:24:06] to do it Hebrews 10 and 1 says can never
[1:24:09] with those sacrifices wish they offered
[1:24:11] year by year continually make the comers
[1:24:13] they're unto perfect for then would they
[1:24:16] not have ceased to be offered
[1:24:20] so as it relates here to atonement and
[1:24:22] paying the sin that we've already
[1:24:24] established that they were not
[1:24:25] sufficient in value to pay off the debt
[1:24:29] but they were also insufficient in
[1:24:31] another way that they were not the same
[1:24:33] nature with man who had committed the
[1:24:37] sin
[1:24:38] they were not the same nature of the one
[1:24:40] who had offended they were not the same
[1:24:43] nature of the one who owed the debt
[1:24:47] so that they're not the same nature they
[1:24:49] were not the nature of the one who had
[1:24:51] defended nor
[1:24:54] were they the same nature of the one who
[1:24:56] had been offended
[1:24:58] they were neither one they weren't the
[1:25:00] nature of man they weren't the nature of
[1:25:02] God they were just an animal
[1:25:05] and also another thing against the Sheep
[1:25:07] poor sheep a lot of them gave their life
[1:25:10] for man but it was insufficient and
[1:25:13] another thing against the Sheep was that
[1:25:15] the Sheep could never consent to be
[1:25:18] killed in the place of the guilty and
[1:25:21] the atoning sacrifice must voluntarily
[1:25:24] substitute himself in the place of the
[1:25:27] guilty
[1:25:28] think about that for a minute Jesus
[1:25:31] didn't have to
[1:25:34] Jesus didn't have to Jesus chose to
[1:25:40] why why would he choose that you
[1:25:43] because he loved you because he wanted
[1:25:46] to fellowship with you because he
[1:25:48] wouldn't give up on you
[1:25:50] and Jesus chose to be the sacrifice
[1:25:54] and we know that the nature of the Lamb
[1:25:56] being different
[1:25:58] could not come into the worshiper and
[1:26:02] change the nature of sin
[1:26:04] it can never come back on us brother
[1:26:07] Brown says the man went right back out
[1:26:09] of the church with the same desire in
[1:26:11] his heart that he had when he come in
[1:26:13] because the blood cell of the Lamb was
[1:26:15] an animal life and not a human life so
[1:26:19] it could not atone for sin it was only
[1:26:22] substitutionary it was only a covering
[1:26:26] so when we say all this and we line up
[1:26:28] all these things that it had to be it
[1:26:30] had to be of value
[1:26:32] it had to be the nature of man but it
[1:26:34] also had to be the nature of God it also
[1:26:36] had to be willing
[1:26:38] man was in an awful place it seemed
[1:26:41] impossible
[1:26:42] where is one walking around in the body
[1:26:45] of a man with the nature of God
[1:26:49] where is one willing to lay his life
[1:26:51] down for people he's never met
[1:26:56] for people who will reject him and turn
[1:26:58] their backs on him
[1:27:00] people who will go out and sin even when
[1:27:02] they knew about where is this person
[1:27:05] it seems so impossible
[1:27:08] no animal could do it because they had
[1:27:10] the wrong nature he didn't have enough
[1:27:12] value and it couldn't willingly
[1:27:14] volunteer
[1:27:15] man himself couldn't do it because there
[1:27:17] was a value needed that no man could
[1:27:20] produce
[1:27:21] why is that because all men were under
[1:27:23] the penalty of death
[1:27:25] and so one under the penalty of death
[1:27:28] could not then die and atone for another
[1:27:30] under the penalty of death so once again
[1:27:33] we have another thing
[1:27:36] that the atonement is going to have to
[1:27:37] check off it has to be someone not under
[1:27:41] the penalty of death someone who
[1:27:43] themselves is not a slave in the old
[1:27:46] days a slave could not purchase a slave
[1:27:48] in order to be a redeemer you had to be
[1:27:51] free
[1:27:54] it was going to take a perfect blood
[1:27:57] someone free from Death to pay the
[1:28:00] penalty of death
[1:28:01] someone of such value that he was worth
[1:28:03] all the souls of men
[1:28:06] someone with the nature of the offender
[1:28:09] and someone with the nature of the
[1:28:11] offended
[1:28:15] someone willing to die
[1:28:17] and this seems completely impossible
[1:28:21] and it goes out is there anyone worthy
[1:28:23] of that price in a human body willing to
[1:28:26] lay down their life for you
[1:28:29] is there anyone brother Brown says
[1:28:32] there's only one thing left that did not
[1:28:35] fall
[1:28:36] everything under man had fallen if you
[1:28:40] think about it even though the lamb was
[1:28:41] innocent that they sacrificed it was
[1:28:44] still Fallen creation
[1:28:47] there was only one thing that had not
[1:28:49] Fallen that was God so something of that
[1:28:52] was God in the heavens so something of
[1:28:54] the heavens had to come down to redeem
[1:28:56] this creation because there was nothing
[1:28:59] here that could create it and God's Own
[1:29:02] love for the World created the character
[1:29:04] expressed in Christ while that struck me
[1:29:07] God's love for the World created the
[1:29:11] character that was expressed in Christ
[1:29:13] he was God's character he was God's
[1:29:16] expressed image in him was God God in
[1:29:19] Christ revealing himself to the world
[1:29:22] and no love could ever be greater than
[1:29:24] that love that such a person would
[1:29:26] become what he did in order to redeem
[1:29:30] what had been lost
[1:29:32] that such a person
[1:29:34] would become what he became
[1:29:37] to redeem what had threw away everything
[1:29:39] he had created
[1:29:41] oh I thank God that he loved me oh for
[1:29:44] God so loved the world God unwilling
[1:29:47] that any should perish he left he left
[1:29:49] Heaven he left his robes he led
[1:29:53] he left Deacon rotten Humanity
[1:29:57] perfect sacrifice
[1:29:59] to be the perfect blood
[1:30:02] because the law required blood
[1:30:06] I know I've said this a lot and we're
[1:30:08] going to keep saying this because I want
[1:30:09] you to recognize there was only one that
[1:30:11] could atone for you
[1:30:13] the blood of sheep couldn't pay it the
[1:30:16] blood of goats couldn't pay it
[1:30:18] the blood of a normal man couldn't pay
[1:30:20] it
[1:30:21] only the blood of God
[1:30:24] could redeem man
[1:30:27] so God himself became flesh because he
[1:30:30] couldn't do it as a spirit
[1:30:32] notice for the very same reason that the
[1:30:34] goats and the Sheep they weren't kin to
[1:30:37] us
[1:30:38] they weren't like us so he couldn't come
[1:30:41] and do it as a spirit he had to take on
[1:30:43] the nature of man the offender
[1:30:46] he had to take on that nature that the
[1:30:48] penalty could be paid but he had to come
[1:30:51] as one not under the penalty
[1:30:54] so he had to be a man but he couldn't
[1:30:56] come like a man
[1:30:59] he had to be a man but he couldn't be
[1:31:01] under the penalty of death brother
[1:31:03] Branham says there had to be another of
[1:31:05] your kind cut down the Lord Jesus the
[1:31:09] perfect one and out of his body was
[1:31:11] beaten with a cat of nine tails across
[1:31:13] his back beat on the head spit in the
[1:31:16] face males drove through and pierced in
[1:31:18] the side and the life of him had to run
[1:31:21] out in order to be the savior
[1:31:24] of your life
[1:31:27] what are you saying I'm saying it had to
[1:31:29] be the blood of God but it had to be
[1:31:31] a man
[1:31:34] it had to have the nature of the
[1:31:36] offender and the nature of the offended
[1:31:39] because if you do away here with the
[1:31:41] Virgin birth and you have him come in
[1:31:43] the exact same way that you and I came
[1:31:45] then he was Mortal in the exact same way
[1:31:48] that you and I are and his blood can no
[1:31:51] longer atone for us
[1:31:53] the Virgin birth was absolutely
[1:31:55] necessary for your atonement
[1:31:59] it was the only thing that gave him the
[1:32:01] value needed and removed him from the
[1:32:03] penalty of death
[1:32:05] one mortal cannot die for another mortal
[1:32:09] because in God's eyes the most holy one
[1:32:11] here is just as guilty as the most
[1:32:14] sinful one here so your value is no
[1:32:17] greater
[1:32:19] the most holy person in this church
[1:32:20] could not die in atone for the most
[1:32:23] sinful person in the world
[1:32:26] because in God's eyes you're all guilty
[1:32:30] we're all guilty one cannot at home for
[1:32:32] the other
[1:32:34] but if he wasn't man
[1:32:36] then he wasn't Kinsmen
[1:32:40] it had to be a perfect blood
[1:32:43] we always talk about it being perfect in
[1:32:44] the fact that he never sinned and that's
[1:32:46] true it was perfect blood but it had to
[1:32:48] be perfect in that
[1:32:50] he had the value
[1:32:52] it had to be perfect in that he had the
[1:32:54] right nature it had to be perfect in
[1:32:56] that he wasn't under the law of sin and
[1:32:58] death it had to be perfect in that he
[1:33:00] was willing
[1:33:01] it had to be perfect in so many ways
[1:33:04] that Satan seemed like he had it all
[1:33:06] stacked up against you
[1:33:08] surely there isn't one that can come and
[1:33:11] fulfill all of this
[1:33:13] I've got good news
[1:33:16] there was one
[1:33:18] and he was willing and he was able and
[1:33:21] his life was valuable enough and it did
[1:33:23] redeem us and it did places back into
[1:33:26] position it did call us out of sin and
[1:33:28] it wasn't just that but there was a life
[1:33:31] in that blood it wasn't just the blood
[1:33:33] that loosed us and we'll get more into
[1:33:35] this later it didn't just loose us but
[1:33:37] it empowered us so that we no longer
[1:33:39] have to go back and live in sin go back
[1:33:42] underneath the curse of the law he came
[1:33:44] and it was a perfect blood it was a
[1:33:46] perfect loosing he was a perfect
[1:33:48] sacrifice he was a perfect Redeemer and
[1:33:51] therefore you can be made perfect
[1:33:56] this Blood had to be of the same nature
[1:33:59] he had to become one of us
[1:34:02] or as we often say and brother Brown
[1:34:04] preaches the wonderful message he had to
[1:34:06] be a Kinsmen Redeemer
[1:34:10] this was according to the law and
[1:34:11] Leviticus the the law of redemption in
[1:34:14] Israel stated that to restore an estate
[1:34:16] to restore property or to restore a
[1:34:20] person whatever the case may be it had
[1:34:22] to be done by a near kin
[1:34:26] that's why goat couldn't do it a bull
[1:34:28] couldn't do it that was just one of the
[1:34:30] things against him is why he a spirit
[1:34:31] couldn't do it
[1:34:33] that's why he had to come his flesh so
[1:34:34] God unable and spirit
[1:34:37] to be kind to us became kin by taking on
[1:34:41] human flesh but he was God
[1:34:45] and brother Brown says we are saved by
[1:34:47] the blood of God that's where my faith
[1:34:50] is not walk out there in the blood of a
[1:34:52] prophet not walk out there in the blood
[1:34:53] of an ordinary man or a teacher or a
[1:34:55] theologian we walk there in the blood of
[1:34:58] God God said so he become human being he
[1:35:02] changed his strand he stretched his tent
[1:35:05] here with us and became one of us he is
[1:35:08] our Kinsmen Redeemer he had to become
[1:35:10] kin folks to us because that was the law
[1:35:13] God became man and dwelt Among Us notice
[1:35:16] in doing this he coming he coming from
[1:35:20] him was God the spirit and that Spirit
[1:35:24] becomes upon the believer therefore the
[1:35:27] life that was in our sacrifice we are
[1:35:30] identified by that same life
[1:35:35] the nature of the sacrifice finally
[1:35:38] has come to a place to where it can come
[1:35:41] back on the believer
[1:35:43] there is an opportunity to no longer go
[1:35:46] out exactly the same way as what you
[1:35:48] came in
[1:35:50] there is an opportunity to not only be
[1:35:52] lose from the guilt and the chains of
[1:35:54] sin but to now be in power to overcome
[1:35:57] that sin
[1:35:59] [Applause]
[1:36:00] so he becomes Kinsmen
[1:36:02] I want to look again specifically here
[1:36:04] at the requirements of a Kinsmen
[1:36:07] first of all he must be a Kinsman
[1:36:09] hopefully we knew that to be a Kinsmen
[1:36:12] you must be a Kinsman what's that mean
[1:36:13] to be a redeemer you must be related
[1:36:19] Leviticus is clear that the Redeemer
[1:36:21] must be related to the one whom he is
[1:36:23] going to buy back out of slavery
[1:36:25] that's why we see here Hebrews 2 and 11
[1:36:27] says for both he that he Sanctified and
[1:36:32] they who are Sanctified are all of One
[1:36:37] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[1:36:39] call them brethren in other words he
[1:36:41] became just like you of the same father
[1:36:45] it's telling you here
[1:36:47] we are all of One same father that makes
[1:36:49] us Kinfolk for which cause he is not
[1:36:52] ashamed to call you brother
[1:36:53] it doesn't get much closer than Ken than
[1:36:56] brother verse 14 says for as much then
[1:36:59] as the children are partakers of flesh
[1:37:03] and blood
[1:37:04] he also himself likewise took part of
[1:37:07] the same
[1:37:09] he became your kinfolks he took part in
[1:37:13] flesh and blood
[1:37:15] number two he must be free himself a
[1:37:20] slave was unable to purchase another
[1:37:21] slave a kinsman redeemer must be himself
[1:37:25] free of the debt and of the bondage
[1:37:27] which had fallen on the one who was to
[1:37:30] be redeemed
[1:37:32] I love that he had to be free of the
[1:37:35] bondage and slavery that had fallen on
[1:37:37] the one that he was there to redeem this
[1:37:39] is why it couldn't be one of us
[1:37:41] this is why it couldn't be one under the
[1:37:43] penalty of death and the only way for
[1:37:46] this to be possible was the Virgin birth
[1:37:48] because there was no sin there was no
[1:37:52] curse there was no claim on the Flesh of
[1:37:55] Jesus Christ
[1:37:56] the devil had no claim on it therefore
[1:38:00] it was free
[1:38:02] free it was free
[1:38:03] number three he must be able to pay the
[1:38:06] price
[1:38:07] if he did not have the necessary sum of
[1:38:09] money which was required to pay the
[1:38:11] purchase price then he would not be able
[1:38:13] to redeem his relatives
[1:38:16] he was worth it
[1:38:19] he was plenty valuable amen his life was
[1:38:22] more than valuable
[1:38:23] and four he must be willing to pay the
[1:38:26] price and make public testimony
[1:38:29] it wasn't enough to have a Kinsman who
[1:38:31] was able to accomplish the work of
[1:38:33] redemption he must also be willing to do
[1:38:36] it
[1:38:38] you know how it is you you call up your
[1:38:41] your uncle who's got lots of money
[1:38:43] you're like hey I'm I need five hundred
[1:38:45] thousand dollars
[1:38:46] he might be more than able to
[1:38:49] I don't mean he's going to
[1:38:53] he's probably going to say look you got
[1:38:55] yourself in this mess you need to work
[1:38:56] your way out of it
[1:38:59] or he may say hey I'll tell you what I
[1:39:01] can give you a little bit
[1:39:03] I can help you out a little bit
[1:39:06] this Redeemer didn't help us out a
[1:39:08] little bit he didn't say I'll give you a
[1:39:10] little portion it was a complete
[1:39:12] Redemption I'll buy back everything I'll
[1:39:14] forgive all your sins I'll save your
[1:39:16] loss I'll heal your sick I'm willing I'm
[1:39:19] able I'm capable I'm worth it I'm free
[1:39:23] and I've come down to redeem that which
[1:39:26] was lost how much of it Lord all of it
[1:39:29] what how many of my sins all of them how
[1:39:33] many of my sicknesses all of that I've
[1:39:35] come to redeem all of it
[1:39:38] and the devil couldn't say one thing
[1:39:40] about it because he had no claim on that
[1:39:43] flesh the Virgin birth Hallelujah
[1:39:47] for God so loved the world
[1:39:51] we have an example of this Kinsmen in
[1:39:54] the story of Ruth and Boaz
[1:39:57] you know Ruth is an awesome example to
[1:39:59] us
[1:40:00] pardon me
[1:40:08] lost example
[1:40:09] because Ruth had every opportunity to
[1:40:12] quit
[1:40:13] she had every opportunity to go back and
[1:40:16] just live the life that she had always
[1:40:17] lived
[1:40:18] every opportunity to go back to her
[1:40:20] people think about it Israel wasn't even
[1:40:22] her people
[1:40:24] her sister-in-law left
[1:40:27] her sister-in-law turned and walked away
[1:40:30] her mother-in-law who she was looking to
[1:40:33] for guidance tried to talk her into
[1:40:35] leaving
[1:40:38] what would we do
[1:40:41] I got a pretty absurd question
[1:40:44] what would you do if brother Tim stood
[1:40:46] up here and tried to talk you out of the
[1:40:47] message
[1:40:54] I only use him because I know y'all
[1:40:55] would hold him in higher regard than me
[1:40:58] if I did it y'all be like oh Tomatoes at
[1:41:00] that man
[1:41:04] hopefully you'd have the same attitude
[1:41:06] towards anybody
[1:41:08] but what if a preacher tried to talk you
[1:41:10] out of it a friend
[1:41:12] a relative
[1:41:14] a website
[1:41:18] that's why we teach and we preach that
[1:41:21] you must have your own experience you
[1:41:25] must meet God for yourself you must know
[1:41:28] that you know that you know that God is
[1:41:30] real it must be a revelation to you
[1:41:33] beyond any head knowledge Beyond mama
[1:41:35] said beyond on Daddy said it must be an
[1:41:38] experience on the inside of your heart
[1:41:40] we've always said it that he who has an
[1:41:42] experience is not at the mercy of one
[1:41:44] who merely has an argument if it's head
[1:41:47] knowledge they can come around and place
[1:41:48] this story with this story and this
[1:41:50] place and make anybody and anything look
[1:41:53] the way they want it to look but when
[1:41:54] you've met God for yourself when you
[1:41:57] know that he's real when you've had a
[1:41:59] backside of the desert experience you
[1:42:01] try to tell Moses that the burning bush
[1:42:03] wasn't real you try to tell Peter and
[1:42:06] 119 more that the upper room didn't
[1:42:09] happen you try to tell Paul that he
[1:42:11] wasn't struck down on the road to
[1:42:13] Damascus it doesn't matter what you try
[1:42:15] to tell me I was there and I say You
[1:42:18] Oughta been there you ought to
[1:42:20] experience it you ought to know it for
[1:42:22] yourself meet this God for yourself
[1:42:27] well you can't be talked out of it I
[1:42:30] won't go back I won't turn around your
[1:42:33] people will be my people your God will
[1:42:36] be my God
[1:42:41] your own experience
[1:42:45] the devil will try to talk you out of
[1:42:47] that
[1:42:52] as years go on
[1:42:55] as time goes by
[1:42:57] as the feelings wear off
[1:43:00] listen
[1:43:03] we don't base things on our feelings
[1:43:06] we know that
[1:43:08] but don't tell me that being in the
[1:43:10] presence of God don't feel good
[1:43:16] but when that wears off
[1:43:19] when you haven't felt it in a while
[1:43:24] what do I do then that's why I want more
[1:43:26] today
[1:43:28] that's why I'm not relying on what God
[1:43:30] did for me last month what he did 10
[1:43:32] years ago I can tell you when I got the
[1:43:34] Holy Ghost but I'm not relying on just
[1:43:36] that experience I want more today I want
[1:43:38] to refill in today I want to experience
[1:43:40] him today I want it fresh and new when
[1:43:42] the Devil comes and says it didn't
[1:43:43] happen I said yeah it did five minutes
[1:43:44] ago I was there you can't talk me out of
[1:43:47] it
[1:43:48] fresh and up to date and bubbling up and
[1:43:50] flowing over but if it's something from
[1:43:52] way back when
[1:43:53] your emotions and your feelings can lie
[1:43:56] to you
[1:44:00] that's why we got to have more today
[1:44:02] and not just more of an experience of
[1:44:04] jump shouting but more revelation
[1:44:06] in our souls that's why the prophet
[1:44:08] would tell you you can never over
[1:44:10] emphasize the importance of Revelation
[1:44:12] to a believer
[1:44:14] y'all know me and I say it all the time
[1:44:16] I'm all about the Run jump and Shout but
[1:44:18] there better be an anchor on the inside
[1:44:19] of your soul there better be a
[1:44:21] revelation deep down in there that I
[1:44:24] know that I know that I know that if I
[1:44:26] don't run and jump and Shout for the
[1:44:27] next 10 years I know that I know that I
[1:44:30] know that I know what do you want more
[1:44:33] of today Aaron more emotional I got
[1:44:35] plenty of it I want more revelation of
[1:44:37] who he is and who I am and his plan and
[1:44:40] what he's done for me and that I'm
[1:44:42] redeemed I'm gonna make it I'm gonna
[1:44:44] overcome because he was the perfect
[1:44:47] blood
[1:44:51] Ruth can't be talked out of it
[1:44:54] and so she stays with it
[1:44:57] and Naomi tells her
[1:44:59] that Boaz is a close Kinsman
[1:45:02] and I won't bog down too much here
[1:45:04] because we all know the story of Ruth
[1:45:05] and Boaz
[1:45:07] but Naomi instructs her to go
[1:45:10] and glean in his field
[1:45:13] and in following that instruction
[1:45:16] it's one thing I love about Ruth as you
[1:45:18] read the book of Ruth you will find that
[1:45:19] she always follows instructions every
[1:45:21] time
[1:45:23] every single time
[1:45:25] that's a problem a lot of us have is the
[1:45:27] following of instructions
[1:45:29] because the death to self-will is the
[1:45:31] hardest death you'll ever die
[1:45:35] Gethsemane
[1:45:37] was a brutal death for Jesus as he died
[1:45:39] out to self-will
[1:45:44] one of the biggest parts of being a
[1:45:46] Christian is being willing to be led
[1:45:49] we throw that word around
[1:45:52] very easily but what if I word it
[1:45:54] differently being the best one of the
[1:45:56] biggest parts of being a Christian is
[1:45:57] being told what to do
[1:46:00] oh we like the word lead oh I was led of
[1:46:03] the spirit
[1:46:04] I was late now you were told what to do
[1:46:08] well I'll tell you what ain't nobody
[1:46:09] gonna tell me what to do I'm um you're
[1:46:11] not going to be a very good Christian
[1:46:16] what is Christianity being told what to
[1:46:18] do all the time
[1:46:23] Roots good at being told what to do
[1:46:26] listen I'm not throwing this out there
[1:46:27] Joe I need help with that
[1:46:29] because it's easy sometimes to see what
[1:46:31] you're supposed to do it's not always
[1:46:32] easy to do it
[1:46:35] we got to pray more from this Lord show
[1:46:37] me your will but Lord when you show me
[1:46:39] your will give me the strength and the
[1:46:40] ability to follow that will
[1:46:42] because it don't always look like the
[1:46:44] best plan to us
[1:46:49] but Ruth's always following instructions
[1:46:50] and so she goes to the field and
[1:46:53] and she encounters the Kinsmen Boaz
[1:46:56] and he is the lord of the Harvest
[1:46:59] in Route 2 and 8 it says then said Boaz
[1:47:02] unto Ruth here is thou not my daughter
[1:47:04] go not to glean in another field neither
[1:47:07] go from hence but abide here fast by my
[1:47:11] maidens let thine eyes be on the field
[1:47:14] that they do reap and go Thou after them
[1:47:18] have I not charged the young men that
[1:47:20] they shall not touch thee
[1:47:22] and when thou art
[1:47:24] a thirst going to the vessels and drink
[1:47:26] of that which the young men have drawn
[1:47:30] what's Boaz instructing her to do here
[1:47:33] stay in my field
[1:47:36] stay
[1:47:38] in the word
[1:47:41] stay with what the word is telling you
[1:47:43] don't go out looking for food outside of
[1:47:46] this word
[1:47:47] don't go out looking for food in the
[1:47:49] denominations outside the revealed word
[1:47:51] of the hour
[1:47:52] don't go out there looking to have your
[1:47:54] needs met somewhere outside of the word
[1:47:57] listen the word has been opened we've
[1:47:59] been returned to the land the the book
[1:48:01] is open and the Kinsman says I've got
[1:48:04] plenty of food for you right here stay
[1:48:06] right here in this land don't go out
[1:48:09] there looking don't get shook up when
[1:48:10] you can't exactly find what it is and
[1:48:12] you go look in here and you go look in
[1:48:14] there
[1:48:15] think about it now you wander here and
[1:48:18] you wonder they're looking for answers
[1:48:19] and that Kinsmen said stay in the field
[1:48:25] you've got all you need but you've got
[1:48:26] to stay here if you want to stay under
[1:48:28] his protection notice he said I've
[1:48:31] commanded my young men not to touch you
[1:48:34] but there's nothing there's no
[1:48:35] jurisdiction in the field next door
[1:48:39] he says touch not mine anointed
[1:48:42] that's not talking about preachers
[1:48:43] you've been anointed
[1:48:45] you've been anointed in this end time to
[1:48:47] sit on the throne you've been anointed
[1:48:48] as the Queen of Heaven and he says touch
[1:48:50] not mine anointed
[1:48:54] but what if you wonder outside
[1:48:57] Hey listen I'm not saying that there
[1:48:59] ain't some psychologists out there that
[1:49:01] don't have some good things
[1:49:03] but are they in the field
[1:49:06] I'm not saying that Dobson or different
[1:49:08] ones didn't have some good things
[1:49:11] I'm not saying that
[1:49:13] but he said stay in the field and I'll
[1:49:15] take care of all your needs
[1:49:18] he said stay in the field brother
[1:49:20] Branham says people are so tired
[1:49:23] they're so mentally strained until
[1:49:25] they're feeling the insane institutions
[1:49:26] in the hospitals everywhere
[1:49:28] they went in such a nervous condition
[1:49:30] till they don't know what they believe
[1:49:31] and what they want they're just laying
[1:49:34] there they don't know what to do it's
[1:49:36] such a sad sight listen here my brother
[1:49:38] you can't drink it off you can't shout
[1:49:41] it off
[1:49:44] neither can you play cars till it's dull
[1:49:46] you could take a thousand siestas and
[1:49:49] try to sleep it off and you can't do it
[1:49:51] all of our little remedies the only
[1:49:53] thing it does is help the symptoms we've
[1:49:56] got to have a cure for the disease all
[1:50:00] the psychiatrists in the world can't
[1:50:02] cure it it only helps the symptoms The
[1:50:05] Cure is in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:50:09] what's he telling you stay in the field
[1:50:12] I'm not saying that there isn't
[1:50:14] something you might can find some barley
[1:50:16] in that field next door I'm not saying
[1:50:17] you couldn't I'm saying if you'll stay
[1:50:19] here you got my protection if you stay
[1:50:22] here you got my word that will drop your
[1:50:24] handfuls on purpose you're not going to
[1:50:26] starve here I'm going to draw water for
[1:50:28] you I'm going to protect you I'm going
[1:50:30] to heal you I'm gonna deliver you I'm
[1:50:32] Gonna Save you I'm going to take care of
[1:50:34] your every need but stay in my field
[1:50:37] don't wander off don't get out there and
[1:50:40] doubt and worry and fear oh no I'm gonna
[1:50:43] go look over here stay where he planted
[1:50:45] you
[1:50:46] the word this morning
[1:50:49] in my field I've commanded no one touch
[1:50:52] you
[1:50:53] in my field I've told them to drop
[1:50:54] handfuls on purpose
[1:50:56] prophet of God says I want you Angels
[1:50:58] you Reapers every once in a while to
[1:51:01] drop a handful on purpose oh don't let
[1:51:03] it be so tiresome to her but every once
[1:51:06] in a while let her hear a good message
[1:51:08] let a good power of the Holy Spirit come
[1:51:11] over once in a while to let her know
[1:51:13] that I'm still there do some kind of a
[1:51:15] healing amongst her show some kind of a
[1:51:18] sign or a wonder that she'll know that
[1:51:21] I'm in her midst
[1:51:24] our Kinsmen is going to make sure that
[1:51:26] our needs are supplied if we'll follow
[1:51:28] directions and we'll stay in its field
[1:51:31] and we know that Naomi instructs Ruth to
[1:51:34] go in while he's resting
[1:51:37] and mark the place where he lays
[1:51:40] and go lay out his feet
[1:51:42] now there's all kind of things we can
[1:51:43] get into right here but this is a
[1:51:45] perfect example
[1:51:47] of being willing to do
[1:51:50] things that may even seem unseemly
[1:51:53] listen she's a moabite
[1:51:55] they don't exactly have the best
[1:51:57] reputation when it comes to moabite
[1:51:59] women and Israelite men
[1:52:01] go back to the scriptures what's this
[1:52:03] going to look like to everybody else
[1:52:07] brother Branham takes this and types it
[1:52:09] out into laying your pride down what's
[1:52:11] it going to look like if I snot on the
[1:52:13] altar
[1:52:14] what are people going to think about me
[1:52:16] if I run and jump and Shout they're
[1:52:17] going to call me Holy Roller
[1:52:19] they're going to call me all kind of
[1:52:21] unseen but if the Bible says You must be
[1:52:23] born again
[1:52:24] then whatever comes with that new birth
[1:52:26] I'm willing to accept it and it may not
[1:52:28] manifest the same in me as it does in
[1:52:30] you but I'm going to take whatever he
[1:52:31] sends no matter how unseeming other
[1:52:34] people may think it is I'm going to
[1:52:36] follow the instruction of the word and
[1:52:37] I'm going to do it
[1:52:39] and so she goes into him while he's
[1:52:41] sleeping
[1:52:43] and Naomi says while he is resting Mark
[1:52:47] the place where he lays
[1:52:51] and go lay at his feet
[1:52:53] church that's beautiful
[1:52:55] that's beautiful Mark the place where he
[1:52:57] laid
[1:52:58] Mark the place where he laid his life
[1:53:00] down for you have you marked Calvary
[1:53:02] tonight it says Mark the place where he
[1:53:05] laid down his life and go in there to
[1:53:07] there and lay yourself at his feet lay
[1:53:09] yourself at the feet of where he shed
[1:53:11] his blood Mark the place where he laid
[1:53:13] Mark the place in Gethsemane Mark the
[1:53:16] place in the tomb where he became your
[1:53:18] Redeemer and go lay your life down at
[1:53:20] his feet lay your life down there and
[1:53:22] say Lord cover me up Lord with your
[1:53:24] blood cover me up Lord with your spirit
[1:53:26] I don't care what other thing I've come
[1:53:28] to lay myself down and mark the place
[1:53:31] where you've laid
[1:53:34] she says and then he will tell you what
[1:53:38] to do
[1:53:39] there we go again
[1:53:41] Route 3 and 4 and it shall be when he
[1:53:44] lies down that thou shalt Mark the place
[1:53:46] where he lie and thou shalt go in and
[1:53:48] uncover his feet and lay thee down and
[1:53:50] he will tell thee what Thou shalt do
[1:53:53] she says you just get to the Kinsmen
[1:53:56] get to the Kinsmen and then he's going
[1:53:58] to tell you what to do
[1:53:59] whatever you tell me Jesus that's what
[1:54:01] I'm going to do Wherever You Lead Me
[1:54:03] Jesus that's where I'm going to go
[1:54:06] listen he's the Kinsmen
[1:54:09] he paid the price
[1:54:11] he died the death
[1:54:13] he gave up his rights he took the
[1:54:15] beating he took the lashing he took the
[1:54:17] whipping he has earned the right to tell
[1:54:19] you what to do if you want his
[1:54:21] Redemption
[1:54:23] we as those in need of being redeeming
[1:54:26] do not have the right to argue with the
[1:54:28] Redeemer the only one who has the
[1:54:30] ability and value and willingness to buy
[1:54:33] us back
[1:54:34] our attitude has to be one of just tell
[1:54:37] me what to do
[1:54:39] Just Lead Me Lord
[1:54:42] if he says You must be born again
[1:54:45] there's no argument we must be born
[1:54:46] again
[1:54:47] if he says women should have long hair
[1:54:49] and men should have short hair who am I
[1:54:51] to debate that
[1:54:53] if he says a woman should dress like a
[1:54:55] lady and not put on a garment that
[1:54:57] pertains to a man and a man shouldn't
[1:54:58] put on a garment that pertains to a
[1:54:59] woman there's nothing to dissect there
[1:55:03] yes Lord
[1:55:04] I'll do it he says separate you need to
[1:55:06] separate from your friends and yes Lord
[1:55:08] you are the Redeemer you paid the price
[1:55:10] you died for me whatever it is you say
[1:55:13] that I will do
[1:55:16] and it comes back to Ruth being an
[1:55:18] incredible uh uh
[1:55:20] example to us because she never argues
[1:55:22] with Boaz he says stay in the field and
[1:55:25] she stays
[1:55:26] prophet of God says Lord I'll take you
[1:55:29] as my savior if the Bible says repent
[1:55:31] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:55:33] Jesus Christ that I'll do if the Bible
[1:55:35] said I must receive the holy ghost that
[1:55:37] I'll do if the Bible tells me Jesus
[1:55:39] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:55:41] forever that I will believe I'll take
[1:55:43] the Bible and God for what he's wrote
[1:55:46] and what he is no matter what anybody
[1:55:48] else said there's the real Ruth he says
[1:55:54] there's the real Ruth
[1:55:56] and once you have done all that the
[1:55:59] Kinsmen tells you to do then you can
[1:56:01] rest
[1:56:03] well brother Aaron how can I rest have
[1:56:05] you seen what's going on in the world
[1:56:07] have you seen what's going on around us
[1:56:09] have you heard what's going on in Russia
[1:56:10] and there's this other guy he's trying
[1:56:12] to overthrow Putin in the and there's
[1:56:13] this going on and and our our president
[1:56:16] he's not real smart and we got lots of
[1:56:18] crazy things going on in politics and
[1:56:20] this and and have you
[1:56:22] and what's Naomi say to Ruth
[1:56:27] but but he hasn't settled the issue yet
[1:56:29] he hasn't redeemed me he hasn't went to
[1:56:30] the gate yet he hasn't done these things
[1:56:31] he says rest
[1:56:33] because I can assure you that he will
[1:56:35] not rest until the matter is settled
[1:56:37] what can I do today brother and you can
[1:56:39] rest because he will not rest until your
[1:56:42] Redemption is complete he will not rest
[1:56:44] until you're healed he won't rest till
[1:56:46] you're delivered he won't rest to your
[1:56:48] children or called back to the Cross he
[1:56:50] won't rest till we get a body change he
[1:56:52] won't rest till there's a Rapture I can
[1:56:54] rest knowing that he will not rest until
[1:56:58] his Redemption is totally and completely
[1:57:01] complete I can rest today it's not me
[1:57:04] it's him and today I'm just resting in
[1:57:07] his atonement I'm resting in his
[1:57:09] Redemption
[1:57:10] he is my Kinsmen Redeemer
[1:57:15] he meets the requirements
[1:57:18] and he's willing
[1:57:21] so I can rest
[1:57:23] he's a Kinsman
[1:57:25] and because we have a Kinsman now there
[1:57:27] is a hope for even the worst of Sinners
[1:57:29] because Christ paid a price that was
[1:57:32] sufficient
[1:57:33] and suitable to all because it was in
[1:57:37] our nature
[1:57:39] it was in our nature
[1:57:42] brother Brown says remember
[1:57:44] a redeemer redeems you completely
[1:57:47] oh brother
[1:57:50] he's done a lot of works but he hadn't
[1:57:51] finished he's not okay he's not stopping
[1:57:54] just rest
[1:57:55] he's a redeemer he's going to redeem you
[1:57:57] completely
[1:57:58] he says when he redeems you it's from
[1:58:00] your sins from your sickness from
[1:58:02] everything that's wrong he is a redeemer
[1:58:06] I say what a redeemer what a blood this
[1:58:09] was it was a perfect blood lost today
[1:58:12] he's the Redeemer sick today he's a
[1:58:14] redeemer depressed today he's a redeemer
[1:58:17] full of fear and anxiety today he's the
[1:58:19] Redeemer you got failures and doubts and
[1:58:21] struggles and and things you fall into
[1:58:23] over and over and over and over he is
[1:58:26] the Redeemer
[1:58:29] he's a perfect Redeemer
[1:58:33] Satan had the whole estate
[1:58:35] and he couldn't redeem it
[1:58:37] we know the story that there was another
[1:58:38] Kinsman that that wouldn't redeem it and
[1:58:41] so that allowed Boaz to and
[1:58:44] Satan wouldn't Satan couldn't
[1:58:47] but Jesus could and Jesus would not only
[1:58:51] that but he was willing to make a public
[1:58:52] testimony
[1:58:55] Boaz had to make a public showing at the
[1:58:57] gate
[1:58:58] and Boaz takes off his shoe and lays it
[1:59:01] aside and says I have bought her I have
[1:59:03] redeemed her and I have purchased Ruth
[1:59:06] to be my wife
[1:59:08] think about it
[1:59:10] they're on golgotha's Hill he was
[1:59:12] stripped down he laid aside more than a
[1:59:14] shoe he laid aside his pride he laid
[1:59:18] aside his royalty he laid aside his
[1:59:20] dignity he laid aside all his power he
[1:59:23] could have signaled the angels to come
[1:59:24] and get him off the cross in a moment
[1:59:26] and he laid it all aside and he made a
[1:59:28] public testimony he said I've redeemed
[1:59:30] her and I've redeemed her with a purpose
[1:59:32] what is that purpose just like Boaz have
[1:59:35] redeemed Ruth to be my wife he made a
[1:59:38] public testimony there on Calvary as his
[1:59:40] Precious Blood spilled and he said I've
[1:59:42] redeemed her to be my bride I've
[1:59:44] redeemed her to be my wife I'm making a
[1:59:47] public show a public testimony I'm
[1:59:49] throwing aside my robes and I'm
[1:59:52] testifying I will redeem her I will
[1:59:56] redeem her I'll lay everything aside and
[1:59:59] I'll be the perfect blood I'll pay the
[2:00:02] price
[2:00:03] for the purpose that she's going to be
[2:00:05] my bride
[2:00:07] I love her
[2:00:08] he says I love her
[2:00:12] bulls and goats
[2:00:14] can only cover the sin
[2:00:16] but the prophet of God tells us that the
[2:00:18] blood of Jesus Christ divorced it
[2:00:22] he said it divorce sin his blood was
[2:00:24] perfect blood and therefore it didn't
[2:00:26] just covered but it remitted sin
[2:00:30] here's the word we see all the time for
[2:00:31] the remission of sins for the remission
[2:00:33] of sins what does remission mean
[2:00:35] remission means the cancellation of a
[2:00:38] debt a charge or a penalty
[2:00:42] even like Tabernacle you are debt free
[2:00:45] today it has been remitted it has been
[2:00:48] canceled it has done away with when the
[2:00:50] Devil comes and he says you owe me this
[2:00:51] you owe me that you oh listen you don't
[2:00:53] got to break into some theological
[2:00:55] sermon on the godhead and explain to him
[2:00:57] the Seven Seals you can point him right
[2:00:59] back to Calvary and say My Redeemer has
[2:01:02] come he has paid the price the debt is
[2:01:04] clear I don't owe you one thing I say
[2:01:08] save the receipt pull the receipt out on
[2:01:10] him the store says you owe us this you
[2:01:12] know I got a receipt I've got a receipt
[2:01:15] this morning I owe you nothing the debt
[2:01:17] is cleared it was a perfect blood a
[2:01:20] cleansing blood a redeeming blood
[2:01:24] I don't owe him anything
[2:01:28] debt-free feels good to be debt free
[2:01:36] bulls and goats couldn't do it
[2:01:38] religion couldn't do it
[2:01:41] saying you believe the message couldn't
[2:01:42] do it
[2:01:44] it's just a covering
[2:01:47] but this Blood was a cleansing blood
[2:01:49] when morality escaped you
[2:01:54] when he had a claim on you
[2:01:55] When sin had you bound there was an
[2:01:58] atonement made for you what was it
[2:02:03] I just wanted to be as real to you as it
[2:02:05] was to me as I studied this it was the
[2:02:07] blood of God
[2:02:10] the blood of God who am I what am I
[2:02:13] is there any worthiness In Me Is there
[2:02:15] any righteousness in me is there
[2:02:16] anything I did to deserve enough I was
[2:02:18] part of Adam's race that threw it all
[2:02:20] away
[2:02:23] blood of God
[2:02:25] came and said
[2:02:27] I'll be Kinfolk
[2:02:29] I'll be the Redeemer
[2:02:31] that was an atonement
[2:02:34] oh come on there was an atonement made
[2:02:37] for you
[2:02:38] there was a blood shed for you and it
[2:02:40] was the blood of God and when you cross
[2:02:42] through the Red Sea of the blood of
[2:02:45] Jesus
[2:02:47] when you cross through that Red Sea then
[2:02:49] you look back in behind you you can see
[2:02:51] every sin every claim every failure
[2:02:54] everything you ever committed you see it
[2:02:56] dead in the blood of Jesus I'll tell you
[2:02:58] what it's no wonder Moses got caught up
[2:02:59] in the spirit it's no wonder Miriam
[2:03:01] grabbed the tambourine you talk about
[2:03:03] debt free not only am I debt free it can
[2:03:06] never come back it can never bother me
[2:03:08] again it has no hold what is it the
[2:03:10] blood of Jesus wiped it clean it took my
[2:03:13] accuser It cast it down it took the
[2:03:16] Taskmaster and it took the whip from his
[2:03:18] hand and it Set Me Free To Worship Him
[2:03:21] no wonder they got in the spirit no
[2:03:24] wonder they rejoiced no wonder they
[2:03:26] shout I'm free I'm free I'm free today
[2:03:30] oh a redeeming blood has set you free
[2:03:35] it's a perfect blood
[2:03:36] for a perfect loosing
[2:03:39] brother Brown says no wonder Moses
[2:03:40] gotten the spirit you talk about having
[2:03:43] some some kind of new religion look at
[2:03:45] this Miriam a prophetess she looked out
[2:03:48] there she picked up a tambourine and she
[2:03:50] began to beat and dance and she went
[2:03:51] down the banks of the sea dancing and
[2:03:53] beating this tambourine and the
[2:03:55] daughters of Israel followed her
[2:03:58] I've always found that very interesting
[2:04:00] when people say well they just did it
[2:04:03] because others were doing it yes what
[2:04:06] the scripture says
[2:04:08] they all did it because Miriam did it
[2:04:10] join in
[2:04:13] take that for what it's worth
[2:04:15] they followed her dancing and singing
[2:04:18] and beating this tambourine and Moses
[2:04:20] raised up his hands and got so caught
[2:04:23] away in the Holy Ghost till he sung in
[2:04:25] the spirit Hallelujah that's right
[2:04:26] that's right that same Holy Ghost was on
[2:04:29] Moses it's in this building tonight
[2:04:30] Hallelujah same one that made marry him
[2:04:33] dance is here tonight God is God and he
[2:04:36] changes not yes sir then you say look at
[2:04:39] that bunch of fanatics
[2:04:41] this struck me
[2:04:43] because I haven't yet seen a service
[2:04:45] quite like this
[2:04:47] seen some powerful Services I've seen a
[2:04:49] lot of people get carried away in the
[2:04:51] spirit
[2:04:53] but I've never seen it to where
[2:04:56] every single person was
[2:05:00] he says but there wasn't anybody to make
[2:05:03] fun of them
[2:05:05] because they was all gone they had it
[2:05:08] all to themselves
[2:05:11] there wasn't anybody making fun
[2:05:14] now I understand the reference there
[2:05:15] they was always referencing the
[2:05:17] Egyptians
[2:05:18] but notice there was no one making fun
[2:05:22] they had it all to themselves there
[2:05:24] wasn't one person in the seat of the
[2:05:26] scornful
[2:05:28] you know God does a lot of Mighty things
[2:05:30] in spite of us sometimes
[2:05:33] he moves a lot of times when most of us
[2:05:35] are in one mind in one Accord
[2:05:44] to where every single human being in
[2:05:46] here was in one mind and one Accord
[2:05:50] I'll answer for you no
[2:05:53] I doubt We've Come Close
[2:05:55] and think of what God has done in our
[2:05:57] midst
[2:05:59] what could he do it's not that much of a
[2:06:02] sacrifice to lay aside your feelings
[2:06:03] towards people
[2:06:05] your feelings of the week behind and the
[2:06:07] week of head for a couple hours
[2:06:10] you can be mad again when you leave
[2:06:16] but for a couple hours lay all that
[2:06:18] aside and say God
[2:06:19] move God deliver God heal God help my
[2:06:25] listen here's the problem we got to put
[2:06:27] ourselves in the seat of the guilty
[2:06:28] sometimes instead of God help that
[2:06:30] brother
[2:06:32] God help me love that brother
[2:06:37] help me lay down my feelings towards
[2:06:39] that brother
[2:06:41] and then we incidentally ruined it by
[2:06:42] going because you know how he did me
[2:06:46] no
[2:06:48] just help me love him
[2:06:51] help me
[2:06:53] you know something I've been saying a
[2:06:55] lot lately how about you worry about you
[2:06:59] and if we can get to that place where we
[2:07:01] all worry about us
[2:07:04] then you won't have nobody else to worry
[2:07:06] about
[2:07:07] the problems will take care of
[2:07:08] themselves it'll allow God to move more
[2:07:12] freely
[2:07:13] when you look around and you realize
[2:07:14] that I don't owe the devil one thing
[2:07:17] my debt has been cleared my debt is
[2:07:19] wiped clean that's why it says there is
[2:07:21] and therefore now no condemnation to
[2:07:24] them which are in Christ Jesus
[2:07:27] quit wallering around in the accusations
[2:07:29] of the enemy Walling around in your
[2:07:32] so-called unworthiness and listening to
[2:07:34] the accusations and worst of all
[2:07:36] agreeing with them
[2:07:38] yeah I'm no good
[2:07:40] yeah I failed again
[2:07:43] none of us are any good
[2:07:46] all of us fail all the time the
[2:07:49] difference is some people look at the
[2:07:51] sacrifice and some people look at
[2:07:53] themselves and if you keep looking at
[2:07:56] yourself you're not going to make it
[2:07:59] what do I got to do what do I got to do
[2:08:02] look through the blood
[2:08:04] put it in the blood
[2:08:06] lay it all in the perfect cleansing
[2:08:08] blood and be perfectly loosed because
[2:08:10] listen it it said there's there for now
[2:08:13] no condemnation it didn't say there is
[2:08:15] now therefore no accusations
[2:08:18] the accusations and the trials and the
[2:08:20] hardships and the doubts and the things
[2:08:22] will always be there
[2:08:23] they're not going away
[2:08:25] he said there is now therefore no
[2:08:27] condemnation in other words the
[2:08:29] accusation is cast out there is no guilt
[2:08:32] proclaimed over you you never did it in
[2:08:36] the first place amen listen I I don't
[2:08:39] know where you're at tonight I don't
[2:08:40] know what situation you're in I don't
[2:08:42] know how dark it is I don't know how
[2:08:44] unmentionable the Deeds of your past may
[2:08:46] be
[2:08:47] but you're not condemned
[2:08:51] there's a message going forth this
[2:08:53] morning telling you that there's a
[2:08:54] perfect blood that was for your perfect
[2:08:56] cleansing for your perfect losing losing
[2:08:59] and it's not that you're perfect it's
[2:09:01] that your sacrifice is amen through the
[2:09:03] power of this perfect blood
[2:09:05] you are Justified
[2:09:08] what's that mean you never did it in the
[2:09:11] first place and now because the nature
[2:09:13] of this blood and this is what we've
[2:09:15] been dealing with with the Kinsmen the
[2:09:16] nature of this Blood because it's from a
[2:09:18] Kinsmen not only are you loosed
[2:09:23] but you are empowered
[2:09:25] it's not only a losing but there has to
[2:09:28] be an empowerment that comes with it
[2:09:30] brother Brown says that's right Jesus
[2:09:32] Christ the son of God come down to bring
[2:09:34] life to the human race is that right and
[2:09:36] in him after his blood being shed and
[2:09:39] the Holy Spirit coming in the blood of
[2:09:41] Jesus Christ
[2:09:43] the Holy Spirit coming in the blood of
[2:09:46] Jesus Christ which was that blood cell
[2:09:48] when it was offered at Calvary it takes
[2:09:51] away the very desire of sin do you see
[2:09:54] that when the life is formed it's a
[2:09:56] spirit in the blood cell and when the
[2:09:59] worshiper offered the blood of the lamb
[2:10:01] and that cell broke it was just acting
[2:10:02] in the place of the real then when the
[2:10:04] worshiper put his hands upon the lamb
[2:10:07] and its throat was cut and its hands was
[2:10:09] bathed red as the little lamb kicked
[2:10:11] dying and finally straightened out and
[2:10:14] was gone the worshiper went right back
[2:10:16] out with the same desire to commit
[2:10:18] adultery lie still that he ever had why
[2:10:22] the blood cell when it was broke the
[2:10:25] life in that blood cell was animal life
[2:10:27] and it can't come back onto human life
[2:10:29] but when the Son of God when that blood
[2:10:33] cell was broke the holy spirit that was
[2:10:36] on him comes back onto the worshiper
[2:10:40] oh Hallelujah
[2:10:42] that's the Crux of the whole thing
[2:10:45] that's the whole thing right there you
[2:10:47] offer sacrifice upon sacrifice upon
[2:10:49] sacrifice and yet sin Reign and death
[2:10:51] Reign because nothing changed but with
[2:10:54] one sacrifice with one life that a blood
[2:10:57] cell could break and release the Holy
[2:10:59] Spirit The Same Spirit that was on the
[2:11:01] inside of him now can come back on the
[2:11:03] inside of you and you're not just loosed
[2:11:06] you're not just loose but you're
[2:11:08] empowered to never go back to bondage
[2:11:11] again that's what it's all about that's
[2:11:14] why this sacrifice was special it was a
[2:11:17] perfect losing and an empowering amen
[2:11:21] every year had been the same thing
[2:11:23] sacrifice and no changed sin and death
[2:11:26] still ruling sin covered temporarily but
[2:11:30] when you come through this blood it's
[2:11:31] more than a covering because there's a
[2:11:34] life in the blood that will Empower you
[2:11:35] to go out of here a different person
[2:11:38] if you failed and you failed and you
[2:11:40] failed I'm telling you there's a blood
[2:11:41] here today with a life in it that'll not
[2:11:44] only forgive you but it will fill you
[2:11:45] and Empower you to be an overcomer amen
[2:11:50] I want to deal with this for a little
[2:11:51] bit
[2:11:53] and we won't be too much longer
[2:11:55] don't be happy
[2:11:58] just being loosed
[2:12:03] don't be happy with just a loosing
[2:12:07] don't stop at just being set free
[2:12:11] because the whole point of him coming in
[2:12:14] a human to pay the debt is so that his
[2:12:16] Spirit could come and live on the inside
[2:12:18] of you
[2:12:20] what are you saying don't be loosed
[2:12:23] be empowered be loosed and empowered
[2:12:26] because I want to ask you a question
[2:12:28] what good is the losing if we
[2:12:30] continually go back to be chained up
[2:12:32] again
[2:12:34] what good is the losing if we continue
[2:12:36] to go back to the same sins that so
[2:12:38] easily beset us
[2:12:40] what good is the losing if we
[2:12:42] continually run right back out into debt
[2:12:44] again
[2:12:45] and we actually end up worse than we
[2:12:47] were before the loosing
[2:12:55] but it happens to people all the time
[2:12:56] because they stop at the losing
[2:12:58] I've seen it Time After Time After Time
[2:13:00] it's where you pray with people in the
[2:13:03] power of God Don't Make Any mistake
[2:13:05] about it the power of God falls on them
[2:13:07] and loses them and they're free and
[2:13:11] there's a shout and a dance as it should
[2:13:13] be we should always celebrate every
[2:13:16] victory
[2:13:18] but they think that's it
[2:13:23] and that was a loosing
[2:13:26] and they don't carry on and push through
[2:13:29] to get the empowering to become endued
[2:13:32] with power from on high like they knew
[2:13:35] they had to have in the upper room
[2:13:38] and so what happens Matthew 12 43 says
[2:13:41] when the unclean Spirit has gone out of
[2:13:43] a man
[2:13:44] he walketh through Dry places seeking
[2:13:46] rest and findeth none
[2:13:48] then he saith I will return into my
[2:13:50] house from whence I came out and when he
[2:13:53] has come he find that the empty swept
[2:13:55] and garnished it's been clean
[2:13:58] something happened
[2:14:00] there's no denying what happened
[2:14:04] we mistook what it was that happened
[2:14:08] is cleaned out
[2:14:10] then go with he and taketh with himself
[2:14:12] seven other Spirits more wicked than
[2:14:14] himself and they enter in and dwell
[2:14:16] there and the last state of the man is
[2:14:18] worse than the first
[2:14:19] I believe we've witnessed many powerful
[2:14:21] loosings and we see that they don't
[2:14:24] always lead to a Victorious Life
[2:14:26] afterwards
[2:14:28] because the person never became
[2:14:30] empowered
[2:14:32] the life of the sacrifice is never
[2:14:34] allowed to completely overtake the
[2:14:36] worshiper and the person actually ends
[2:14:39] up worse
[2:14:40] than they were to begin with
[2:14:43] brother Branham says it like this the
[2:14:45] same thing exists today it will happen
[2:14:48] it does happen
[2:14:51] there is Devils but Jesus cast them out
[2:14:54] and he gave his church authority to do
[2:14:56] so cast out devils in my name do we all
[2:14:58] agree with this
[2:15:00] stay with me for a few more minutes here
[2:15:02] cast out he says Devil's in my name he
[2:15:05] cast Seven Devils out of the Pretty
[2:15:07] Woman one day and he said when the
[2:15:09] unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he
[2:15:11] walks in dry places returning back then
[2:15:13] bringing seven other Devils with him now
[2:15:16] that goes to show that if the man was
[2:15:18] cleansed of devils there was something
[2:15:20] was in him had gone out a loosing okay
[2:15:25] a devil had gone out now when the devil
[2:15:28] moved out God gives an opportunity for
[2:15:31] God to move in
[2:15:33] so when he goes out let the Holy Spirit
[2:15:36] come in don't just leave it there if you
[2:15:40] do now listen to this
[2:15:42] this struck me so strong if you do just
[2:15:45] repent of your
[2:15:47] s then you're going to be worse off than
[2:15:50] ever
[2:15:53] if you just repent and get loosed and
[2:15:56] get free and go on watch out you'll be
[2:15:59] worse off than you ever were before he
[2:16:03] says but get that place where Satan once
[2:16:06] lived and occupied get it filled with
[2:16:08] the holy spirit of God and then you'll
[2:16:11] have the strength of God's word in you
[2:16:13] manifested and cast out Devils contest
[2:16:16] is on the evening lights are shining
[2:16:19] God's holy spirit is present
[2:16:23] I believe if we sit here for a minute
[2:16:24] and think about it we've all witnessed
[2:16:26] this exact same thing
[2:16:29] and for some it's even been a stumbling
[2:16:31] block because we see something take
[2:16:33] place
[2:16:34] we see a moment where someone has an
[2:16:37] encounter or deliverance and we rejoice
[2:16:39] in it and as I said we always will and
[2:16:41] always should
[2:16:42] but then as time passes on not only does
[2:16:45] that person go back to their old ways
[2:16:47] but they go back even worse than they
[2:16:49] were before the experience
[2:16:53] and the first thing that people want to
[2:16:54] do is to go back to that moment in the
[2:16:56] church or go back to that moment at camp
[2:16:58] or go back to wherever it took place and
[2:17:01] cast doubt upon the validity of what
[2:17:04] happened
[2:17:07] or was it even God
[2:17:11] I think they just got really emotional
[2:17:14] they got really excited and did you see
[2:17:16] how
[2:17:17] those preachers had their hands on and
[2:17:18] they got excited and they began to jump
[2:17:20] around me of course
[2:17:22] and they began to cast doubt on the
[2:17:23] Supernatural and the validity of it well
[2:17:25] that wasn't really God
[2:17:27] no
[2:17:29] it was a victory it was a loosing and a
[2:17:32] victory that was worth celebrating
[2:17:36] but they stopped short of being filled
[2:17:38] with the Holy Ghost
[2:17:40] is very clear in the scriptures very
[2:17:42] clear in the message they stopped short
[2:17:44] of being endued with power they didn't
[2:17:46] progress further enough and make sure
[2:17:48] that the seal was there that would give
[2:17:50] them power when the devil came back to
[2:17:52] try to get back inside
[2:17:54] even in like Tabernacle we can never
[2:17:56] stop short
[2:18:00] don't ever get tired of hearing the
[2:18:01] ministry preach the baptism of the Holy
[2:18:03] Ghost we must have the baptism of the
[2:18:06] Holy Ghost we must get it for ourselves
[2:18:08] we must get it for our children we must
[2:18:10] lead them to it we must preach it we
[2:18:12] must offer it we must have the
[2:18:13] atmosphere for it we must celebrate
[2:18:15] every Victory they have along the way to
[2:18:17] get to it
[2:18:20] celebrate their victories
[2:18:22] celebrate each and every step they take
[2:18:25] but don't stop short of the infilling or
[2:18:28] the empowerment of the baptism of the
[2:18:31] Holy Ghost we must always not just
[2:18:33] preach the Forgiveness of sins but we
[2:18:35] must preach the life and the power of
[2:18:37] the blood not just a loosing but an
[2:18:40] empowering he did not pay the price so
[2:18:43] that we could just be church members
[2:18:45] he didn't pay the price of redemption so
[2:18:47] we could go in and out and back and
[2:18:49] forth and stumble and fall in and out
[2:18:51] but he paid the price so that the life
[2:18:54] of the blood the life of the sacrifice
[2:18:56] could come back on the inside of each
[2:18:58] and every one of us and where he
[2:19:00] overcame we overcome where he cast out
[2:19:03] Devils we cast out Devils where he rose
[2:19:05] above sin We rise above sin and where he
[2:19:09] conquered death We Will Conquer death
[2:19:11] and take a Rapture because we are bone
[2:19:13] of his bone and flesh of his flesh and
[2:19:16] because of that that life can come on
[2:19:18] the inside of this life don't stop short
[2:19:21] of that
[2:19:25] we must always preach the Holy Ghost
[2:19:29] break the cycles
[2:19:31] and trample over sin like he did he said
[2:19:33] go in sin
[2:19:35] no more
[2:19:37] go and sin no more there was an
[2:19:39] empowerment
[2:19:41] so you let that life be born in you to
[2:19:43] where it's no longer you but it's Christ
[2:19:45] that liveth in man
[2:19:48] can't stop short
[2:19:50] can't stop short
[2:19:52] can't be happy with the loosing
[2:19:54] I'm happy to be loosed but I got to
[2:19:57] press on into an empowerment
[2:19:59] you see that all down Through the Ages
[2:20:00] we spoke about it in individuals but
[2:20:02] look at it in a broader sense look at it
[2:20:04] in the church world
[2:20:06] the churches that believed on Christ but
[2:20:08] stopped short of the new birth
[2:20:10] what happened
[2:20:13] we talked about it in an individual but
[2:20:15] think about the church world the church
[2:20:16] went from The Upper Room
[2:20:19] to the cage of every unclean and hateful
[2:20:22] burden
[2:20:24] early on they pressed forward to the new
[2:20:26] birth but when they stopped and it
[2:20:28] became about ritual and form and just
[2:20:30] accept the word
[2:20:32] and they stopped pushing for the New
[2:20:34] Birth the next thing you know look at
[2:20:36] them there
[2:20:37] look at them now and tell me they're not
[2:20:39] exponentially worse than they were
[2:20:43] and we find every church that stops
[2:20:46] short of the new birth
[2:20:47] is in a worse condition now
[2:20:50] than when they came out of the Catholic
[2:20:52] Church
[2:20:53] when they came out they were the move of
[2:20:55] God when they came out they were on fire
[2:20:57] when they came out they had the word for
[2:20:58] the hour but look where they're at now
[2:21:02] exponentially worse brother Brown says
[2:21:04] you can be sanctified
[2:21:06] and not have the Holy Ghost
[2:21:09] right Sanctified Spirit without being
[2:21:11] filled sanctifying your heart cleansing
[2:21:13] your heart without filling it with
[2:21:15] something that's what he said when the
[2:21:17] unclean spirit is going out of the man
[2:21:19] he walks in dry Places come back finds
[2:21:21] his house all garnished and comes in the
[2:21:24] last estate of that person is many times
[2:21:26] seven times worse than it was at the
[2:21:28] first that's what happened to the
[2:21:30] pilgrim holiness
[2:21:33] to the nazarenes and so forth you
[2:21:35] accepted
[2:21:36] and when the Holy Ghost come and begin
[2:21:38] to speak in tongues and give signs and
[2:21:40] wonders you called it the devil and
[2:21:42] blasphemed the works of God Called It an
[2:21:44] unclean thing and you see where your
[2:21:47] church went
[2:21:50] they were loosed from the Catholic
[2:21:52] system
[2:21:54] but they never let the Holy Spirit
[2:21:56] Empower them
[2:21:58] what are we preaching today a perfect
[2:22:00] blood loosed and empowered because this
[2:22:04] Blood provides for you a loosing and it
[2:22:07] also provides for you a power to never
[2:22:09] be bound again
[2:22:11] like Tabernacle I say take advantage of
[2:22:14] it
[2:22:15] take advantage of the empowering quit
[2:22:18] living below your privileges quit
[2:22:20] walking around just as church members
[2:22:21] quit walking around beat down and cage
[2:22:24] down you've been loose now be empowered
[2:22:26] and if you've been empowered be
[2:22:28] empowered again if you've had an
[2:22:30] experience have another experience if
[2:22:32] you've got God on the inside get more of
[2:22:34] God on the inside don't just be loose
[2:22:37] this morning but be loose and push
[2:22:39] forward until you're completely
[2:22:41] empowered it's the life of the blood
[2:22:43] that we're after it's the life of the
[2:22:46] blood that we need it's the life of the
[2:22:48] bloodstream that can put us back in
[2:22:50] fellowship with where we were before the
[2:22:52] fall
[2:22:54] think about the attitude of well we're
[2:22:56] all going to sin a little and we all
[2:22:57] have things that we can't overcome
[2:23:01] that's saying that the blood of Jesus is
[2:23:03] no more efficient than the blood of
[2:23:04] bulls and goats
[2:23:07] you're putting it on the same level if
[2:23:09] we're going to continue and sin then why
[2:23:10] did Jesus die
[2:23:12] why don't we just go kill a goat
[2:23:17] that's a denominational Viewpoint it's
[2:23:19] an attitude that declares the the power
[2:23:21] of the blood isn't enough
[2:23:23] but I'm here today to declare to you
[2:23:25] that it was a perfect blood
[2:23:27] it was a perfect blood
[2:23:30] the prophet of God tells us in this this
[2:23:31] quote
[2:23:33] is where the thought for this service
[2:23:34] came from so I want you to hang on this
[2:23:36] with me
[2:23:37] when I read this it was just so powerful
[2:23:39] to me it says consider this
[2:23:42] since it is the blood of God
[2:23:44] it is perfect blood
[2:23:46] and if the perfect blood is loosing us
[2:23:49] from the power and bondage and
[2:23:51] defilement of sin then the loosing is
[2:23:54] perfect and complete there is now
[2:23:57] therefore no condemnation who shall lay
[2:23:59] anything to the charge of God's elect it
[2:24:01] is God that justifieth who is he that
[2:24:04] condemneth it is Christ that died there
[2:24:07] it is his death gave us the blood the
[2:24:09] blood has loosed us there is now no
[2:24:11] condemnation How can there be there is
[2:24:13] nothing to be condemned for because the
[2:24:16] blood has loosed us from sin we are free
[2:24:18] Guiltless don't listen to man listen to
[2:24:21] the word you are loosed by the blood now
[2:24:24] don't get tied down again by traditions
[2:24:26] and Creeds and organizations don't get
[2:24:29] LED astray by listening to those that
[2:24:30] deny the power of the word and deny that
[2:24:33] Jesus saves heals fills with the Holy
[2:24:35] Ghost in power you are God's free men
[2:24:39] loosed by his own blood
[2:24:43] listen if the blood is perfect then the
[2:24:46] works of that blood is perfect Therefore
[2:24:48] your salvation is perfect your Holy
[2:24:50] Ghost is perfect your deliverance is
[2:24:53] perfect your healing is perfect it is
[2:24:55] complete because it's a perfect loosing
[2:24:59] and because it's a Kinsmen it can come
[2:25:01] back on the inside and he has redeemed
[2:25:04] you
[2:25:05] perfectly
[2:25:08] listen he didn't stop short in his
[2:25:09] Redemption
[2:25:12] he didn't stop short he thought of
[2:25:14] everything
[2:25:15] he covered every angle he covered every
[2:25:18] aspect of repayment
[2:25:20] going so far as to go to hell
[2:25:24] for you
[2:25:26] that bull could die
[2:25:28] but it couldn't redeem you
[2:25:31] that goat could die
[2:25:33] but it couldn't go to hell for you
[2:25:36] but this one
[2:25:38] having a soul like you
[2:25:41] having a human nature meeting all the
[2:25:44] requirements of the Kinsmen went into
[2:25:47] the belly of hell
[2:25:48] and conquered
[2:25:51] he battled every demon
[2:25:53] here
[2:25:55] and there
[2:25:57] think about it he faced depression in
[2:26:00] hell and conquered it he faced fear in
[2:26:04] hell and conquered it he faced suicide
[2:26:07] spirits and conquered them he was
[2:26:10] attacked by lust and came out of hell
[2:26:12] pure
[2:26:13] think about that he went down into hell
[2:26:15] in every grimy every evil every slimy
[2:26:19] every hateful Spirit began to come up
[2:26:21] and rub up against them why was he there
[2:26:24] paying the price for you
[2:26:27] why was he there in the pits of hell
[2:26:30] so you wouldn't have to go
[2:26:33] but I got good news this morning
[2:26:36] he didn't stay there
[2:26:38] because there was a word that said I
[2:26:39] will not leave his soul in Hell or allow
[2:26:42] my Holy One to seek corruption he had to
[2:26:44] resurrect on the third day and why did
[2:26:46] he do that because he had to ascend and
[2:26:48] why did he do that because he had to
[2:26:50] send back the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:26:52] the life of the perfect blood so you
[2:26:54] could be perfectly loose so you could be
[2:26:56] perfectly empowered oh he didn't just
[2:26:59] come and die but he sent back his life
[2:27:01] why so that I could overcome like he did
[2:27:04] so that I could be victorious like he
[2:27:06] was Victorious
[2:27:08] it's a perfect loosing tonight
[2:27:10] it's a perfect loosing
[2:27:12] so you could walk in Victory
[2:27:15] brother Aaron will I not war anymore
[2:27:16] yeah your War you'll battle you'll face
[2:27:20] tests and trials and tribulations
[2:27:23] but because of a perfect blood you're
[2:27:25] overcoming will be perfect
[2:27:29] because greater is he
[2:27:33] that is
[2:27:35] in you
[2:27:38] a Kinsman
[2:27:39] than he that's in the world
[2:27:42] it's only possible
[2:27:45] because he became Kinfolk
[2:27:47] it's only possible because he became sin
[2:27:51] we can only even speak about these
[2:27:53] things because he loved us so much
[2:27:55] and his love was so far greater
[2:27:58] that he said
[2:28:00] it's going to take a perfect blood
[2:28:03] I'll go
[2:28:05] I'll go
[2:28:06] I'll be the Kinsman I'll be made sin
[2:28:09] I'll die the death I'll go to hell I'll
[2:28:12] pay the debt
[2:28:14] even like Tabernacle
[2:28:16] you're debt free
[2:28:18] you're debt-free you don't got to pay
[2:28:21] one thing
[2:28:22] just dip your soul in the perfect blood
[2:28:24] of Jesus the perfect Redeemer the
[2:28:27] perfect atonement I got things bothering
[2:28:29] me run it through the Red Sea of the
[2:28:31] blood of Jesus Christ this morning and
[2:28:33] watch those things break off your life
[2:28:35] will you stand together with me this
[2:28:37] morning
[2:28:40] brother Branham says
[2:28:44] I tell the truth in Christ
[2:28:46] Allah not
[2:28:48] there's no man can take the doctrine
[2:28:50] that I preach and disprove it
[2:28:52] there's no one can do it
[2:28:54] I have never seen anyone could do it
[2:28:57] because it's the gospel truth the
[2:28:59] discernment of the spirit is perfect
[2:29:01] no man can ever say that it's not ever
[2:29:04] been perfect
[2:29:07] that's a pretty good way to start a
[2:29:08] statement I'm going to have faith in
[2:29:09] what it is he says right here
[2:29:11] and I tell you now there's a perfect
[2:29:14] place there's a perfect heaven there's a
[2:29:17] perfect God a perfect savior a perfect
[2:29:19] blood a perfect atonement a perfect
[2:29:22] being for you
[2:29:26] I accept it Jesus
[2:29:28] I'm not going to wallow in my failures
[2:29:30] I'm not going to wallow in my unbelief
[2:29:32] but Lord today I accept it and by
[2:29:35] accepting that he says you are the pure
[2:29:37] virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the
[2:29:40] Living God every man and woman that's
[2:29:43] born of the spirit of God and washed in
[2:29:44] the blood of Jesus Christ and believes
[2:29:46] every word of God stands as though you
[2:29:49] never sinned at the first place you are
[2:29:53] perfect the blood of Jesus Christ I say
[2:29:56] hallelujah you are perfect through the
[2:29:59] blood of Jesus Christ what a redeemer
[2:30:02] what a blood what a loosing what an
[2:30:06] empowerment when it seemed impossible he
[2:30:09] said I'll do it I'm worthy I'm free
[2:30:14] and he came to Lucius celebrate your
[2:30:17] freedom
[2:30:18] celebrate your freedom here we are on
[2:30:20] the weekend of the Fourth of July I'm
[2:30:23] thankful for the freedom we have in this
[2:30:24] country whatever we have left of it I'm
[2:30:26] thankful for but let me tell you this
[2:30:28] our freedom in Christ has not diminished
[2:30:30] but it has grown greater and greater and
[2:30:33] greater and I'll say this we can
[2:30:34] celebrate that freedom be free in your
[2:30:37] Redemption be free in the blood of Jesus
