We've heard the shout, the mighty message of God forth. &gt;&gt; In this last day, calling a bride to you. Lord, we want to just express today how we love you as a bride people, God, making love back to our bridegroom, a people who are in unison and in harmony with you and your word, Lord. No disagreements, but a love affair, oh God. And we want to say we love you with all our heart, with all our soul, with all that's within us. And if there's anything that we've held back, Lord, we want to surrender that to because we want nothing between you, our savior. Lord, I pray, dear God, that you'll bless us today in your presence. May the Holy Spirit come real today among us. May you anoint us, Lord. Oh God, &gt;&gt; may you take the fragments of thoughts that I have here today before me and take them and by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, bring a message from heaven today to your people. Touch lives, touch hearts, Lord, draw us near to you, Father. Every need, supplying among us, Lord. There are those that we've heard that have been sick, needy, would not be able to be here today, sick at home and has need.

You can write every wrong, put everything in the right place, Lord. you know every need today and we give ourselves to you now to serve you. We surrender ourselves Lord. We say now Lord speak for your servant hears Lord let us have a heart to receive oh God and use my voice today to ring out your message not only here but around the world wherever it would go and touch hearts and lives. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. God bless you. It's good to be in the house of the Lord today. We want to welcome you and want to say that it's as David said, it was good for us to go to his house. Amen. To come and worship him and we have we have dedicated this place to him and we just want to consecrate our lives to him today because we are to be the temple, the real temple of the Holy Ghost. Amen. God bless you. Thank you. Amen. We so appreciated the wonderful music. As we said, welcome to everyone. If you're a guest here today, we hope you won't feel like a visitor, but just a part of us and you'll just enter in and you know, it's like Will, you show up, we put you to work. And so, we we sure uh enjoy the the gift, the talent in his life. And man, my wife's brother Ronnie, his wife Tilda is here today, and we're happy to have them in service with us. and over here Austin also uh we so appreciate each one of you if I don't call your name and whatever but I I um I just want you to know we are so happy to have you. Sometimes it takes a little while to see everybody in the congregation but God sees you and that's what's important. Amen. He knows where you are. He knows your address. He knows the desire in your heart. He knows what you've been talking about, what you've been thinking about, what you've been praying about. and he has the answer for your situation. Amen. I'd like you to turn with me to Joel chapter 2 and verse 23 for the scripture reading this morning. And uh also we will look at another passage in the book of Joel. But first verse 23 of chapter 2 keeping our theme in mind. Who art thou great mountain be you shall become a plain. Amen. For he shall bring forth a headstone crying grace, grace into it. So we're speaking on today the mountain movers. It's harvest time. So verse 23 says, "Be glad then you children of Zion. Rejoice in the Lord your God, for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will come cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month. And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vat shall overflow with wine and oil. And I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten, the cankerorm, the caterpillar, and the palmer worm, my great army, which I sent among you, and you shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you, and my people shall never be ashamed. and ye shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and none else, and my people shall never be ashamed." And this is then quoted by Peter on the day of Pentecost. And it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh. And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. Your old men shall dream dreams. Your young men shall see visions. And also upon the servants, and upon the handmmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come. And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord has said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call. Then turn to the next chapter in Joel 3:E 13. put you in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come get you down, for the press is full, the fats overflow, for their wickedness is great. Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision. For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision. The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining. The Lord also shall roar out of Zion and utter his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth shall shake. But the Lord will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel. So shall you know that I am the Lord your God, dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain. And then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall be no strangers pass through her anymore. God bless you. You can have your seats. It's harvest time &gt;&gt; and at harvest time there is a ripeness of the grain. There's full maturity and it is time to put in the sickle as we read from Joel 3:13. Put you in the sickle for the harvest is ripe. You see the grain must reach full maturity before it can be harvested. And we are in the age of the finished cycle. And the bride has become has come back to the full word again. Restored to the faith that was once delivered to the saints. &gt;&gt; And it's not just by letter only, but in demonstration. As we say, the the wheat is no longer in the green stage of the the blade, the tusel or the shuck, but it's the grain. It's the life has now returned to the original. And the bride of course must reflect the word image of Christ, not a denomination or a creed. But it's it's maturity that is here. See, the bride is a ripened grain that was planted at Pentecost. If you'll look with me to Revelation 14:E1 14 and I want to look at a very profound scripture that means more and more to me in this as we continue at thinking of this harvest cycle. And he said, "And I looked and behold a white cloud and upon that cloud one like unto the son of man having on his head a golden crown and his hand a sharp sickle." And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, "Thrust in thy sickle, and reap, for the time is come for thee to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe." Here to me is one of the most glorious and solemn prophetic scenes in all the scripture. Notice it is the son of man himself that is crowned with gold and he's seated upon a cloud of glory holding in his hand a sharp sickle and he's ready to reap the earth. It is both majestic and fearful. The the it's the moment of final separation. It's the hour of righteous reckoning. It's the culmination of divine suffering. As I as I think just for a moment, um, yesterday we committed the ashes of my wife's brother Rodney into the ground. And I I thought about how that the long wait of the Lord's return has made it where another was planted in the soil. And as I have often said through the years, you say, "Brother Tim, you preached the coming of the Lord for years now." And I certainly have. And he's come for many. &gt;&gt; And he came for Rodney. And he came suddenly. And even today, we look forward to him thrusting in the sickle and harvesting the saints of the New Testament. Even as Jesus resurrected the Old Testament saints when he resurrected. But oh, how long God has been. instead of taking the first wheat sheath at of grain at Pentecost that ripened 2,000 years ago, cuz I believe God had a church there that was without a spot or wrinkle. &gt;&gt; I believe that it was a mature church, but instead of taking her immediately into glory, he planted it. &gt;&gt; He planted it. He swed it in the earth as a seed so that a full harvest could come forth. And that first grain, Christ in the early bride, was was not plucked up prematurely, but it was planted in faith that through the seven ages of trial, persecution, and testing, a ripened bride would come to maturity. &gt;&gt; As John 20 12:24 says, "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. &gt;&gt; And I believe that's what God has done in in this season of where he planted on the day of Pentecost. And now he's bringing forth a crop, a righteous crop, a bride that will be in his image, &gt;&gt; a people that is called for his name. &gt;&gt; And what may seem like delay has only been God's mercy. &gt;&gt; It has been his determined patience. And the the Apostle Peter reminds us in second Peter 3:9, the Lord is not slack concerning his promise, but he's longsuffering to usward that that not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. I'll tell you, we serve a merciful God. &gt;&gt; For he, you see, before the world began, he planned your coming. He knew you would be here. He wrote your name in the lamb's book of life. And every name written in the lamb's book of life, written before the foundation of the world, must be born. &gt;&gt; It must live. It must be manifested. And above all, it must be redeemed. And the husband waits for the precious fruit of the earth, refusing to thrust in the sickle until every last grain has appeared in its season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No wonder then he would store up the prayers of of even the apostle John when he would pray the last prayer saying even so come Lord Jesus. Yes. &gt;&gt; And he would wait and wait and wait, ages upon ages upon ages because your name was in the book, too. &gt;&gt; God's waiting till the last member of the body has come in and then the rapture will come. &gt;&gt; For seven ages, he has watched over his crop. He's watered. He's pruned. He's separated. He's restored. But you know now we we have come to the climax of the ages and I want to tell you the harvest is ripe &gt;&gt; and the time has come to reap and what a harvest that will be. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in this moment oh he will harvest both the sleeping saints and the living bride. The dead in Christ shall rise first. And we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air. And this is the great in gathering, the longawwaited reunion of the redeemed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The harvest the Bible said is the end of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said he would gather the wheat into the garner. And this is not just the end of an age. It's the beginning of eternity for the bride. So therefore, we see an hour where it's the ending of time and the blending of eternity. And and and of course, it makes it harvest time. It's raptured hour. It's bride time. It's the final cycle when the marriage of the lamb is at hand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She hath made herself ready. She's been ripened by the sun. She's been sealed by the spirit. She'd been separated from the tears. And now she's gathered for glory. What an hour we're living in. &gt;&gt; What a jade we are. When the sickle is in his hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where the cloud is already formed. Where the call has gone out. &gt;&gt; Where the time has come. Thrust in thy sickle and reap. &gt;&gt; It's the time of harvest. It's the time of separation. And it's the time of gathering the wheat into the barn. Harvest time is rapture time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So again, we want to think of this as we have read from Revelation 14:14. And he says, "Behold, a white cloud." &gt;&gt; Think of that. He cometh in clouds of glory. Clouds in the book of Revelation don't refer to thunderheads. It doesn't refer to atmospheric weather patterns. It's a Revelation is a book of symbols. &gt;&gt; And these clouds are glory clouds. They are not storm clouds. &gt;&gt; Amen. They are signs of his divine presence. Just like on the mount of transfiguration where Jesus countenance was altered and his garments glistened and a cloud overshadowed them. That was not a storm. It was the shina glory of God coming down. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Revelation 1:14 said his eyes are as a flame of fire. Yes. She describes him again, not in loneliness, but as a judge with eyes with flames of fire. &gt;&gt; I want to think I want you to think of it right now. Those eyes that was once dimmed in sorrow with tears of sorrow. Eyes that wept at the grave of Lazarus, that looked on compassion with at the multitude, the crippled, the halt, the blind. Amen. That that forgave the very ones that were nailing him to the tree. Now they burn with fire. &gt;&gt; The eyes that once wept now blaze with the fury of divine justice. He once said upon the cross, "Father, forgive them." And now it has become in righteousness. He doth judge and make war as he thrust in the sickle. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what God is doing. The man of sorrows now becomes crowned as the judge &gt;&gt; as he separates the wicked from the righteous. Now throughout his early ministry we know Jesus wept. He showed his humanity. He was all God yet he was man. &gt;&gt; He was a man of sorrows acquainted with grief. But even behind those tears he was still God. seeing all, knowing all, judging righteously. And he said in John 8:24, "If you believe not, I am he, you will die in your sins." &gt;&gt; He says in John 10:37 and 8, "If I do not the works of my father, believe me not." And like Jeremiah, he was the weeping prophet, for his own received him not. But now the time of weeping has passed. Now his eyes are as a flame of fire searching, exposing, discerning. Amen. Hebrews 4:13 said, "All things are naked and open to the the eyes of him with whom we have to do." For he's the one whom we are accountable to. &gt;&gt; Even now those eyes are scanning the earth. No one ever thought, knowing your motive. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every hidden deed, nothing is veiled from his gaze. No sin is hidden from him. Even every evil thought is exposed. &gt;&gt; Oh my, he knows what's in your closet. &gt;&gt; He knows the things you are hiding in your life. And I want you to know the day of mercy is now drawing to a close. &gt;&gt; The books are open. The judge is standing at the door. Behold, he cometh with clouds. Not storm clouds, &gt;&gt; but glory clouds. &gt;&gt; The cloud that he comes in, as I said, is not a thunderhead. &gt;&gt; It's wave after wave of his glorious presence. &gt;&gt; Notice it's a pouring out of his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wave after wave of it. &gt;&gt; Just as on the mount when the cloud of enveloped him. So again, he comes in the cloud of glory as he says in in Revelation 1:7, he cometh with cloud. This is the glory of his peruia, the glory of his presence spreading across the earth in waves of resurrection power. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Spirit that once lived in the hearts of saints now is calling their bodies from the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Tears that dried on their cheeks, bodies that lowered into the ground in sorrow. But now the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead now quickens them. &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4:16 prophesies, "And the dead in Christ shall rise first." &gt;&gt; Wave after wave after wave of his glory. The order of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; That's right. Let me talk about it for a moment because what a glorious mystery. &gt;&gt; Yet it is wrapped in the wisdom of God. Yet to man is hidden right in plain sight. &gt;&gt; The Bible said in Matthew 2:16, "So the last shall be first and the first shall be last." &gt;&gt; Think of that. Now apply that to the resurrection. Those that went down last will be the first to come up. &gt;&gt; And those that went down first will be the last to come up. &gt;&gt; So how can this be? This is no ordinary resurrection. It's a divine order of the harvest. It's the sequence of glory that only God himself could orchestrate. &gt;&gt; Think of what I'm talking about. Each each generation will will rise in its appointed time in its prophetic order as the great harvest of the ages unfolds. Let's get a glimpse of it. I mean, as brother Bradom said it, he said, "I I'll know those of my time, none, but not before or after, but those I ran the race with. My father will will rise with his generation, his father with his." So each will come in divine sequence wave after wave after wave until the whole bride of the seven ages will stand together complete united and immortal. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a day that will be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Think of it. Seven voices, seven thunders, one resurrection symphony. &gt;&gt; Amen. The living saints changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye will will sound that call. Amen. Like the thunder, the sound of thunder from heaven, the voice that is in the bride awaken in the age before them. Think of what I'm saying. From Leodosa, the call will echo back through time. And Leodysa will call Philadelphia. And Philadelphia will rise with the Methodist and the and Wesley and those shouting Methodist there. Oh, and then Wesley will stir Luther and Luther then will cry out to Columba and Columba will reach a hand out to Irene and Irene will shout out to Paul, Peter, James and John and Steven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Seven voices, seven thunders, seven church ages awakening in divine sequence. &gt;&gt; What do you mean thunders, brother Tim? Voice of God. &gt;&gt; Each calling his brethren from the voice from the dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. With a trump of God, with the voice of the archangel, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. If you believe it, say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a resurrection it'll be. &gt;&gt; Not just bones rattling back to life, but the bride rising, full of life, full of life, full of glory, dressed in immortality. &gt;&gt; Amen. No one, no one will come out of the grave and rides of mortality. &gt;&gt; No one will wear the scars of sickness or the garments of sorrow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Each saint will rise clothed in their theophony, &gt;&gt; reunited with their glorified body, robed in pure white, wedding garments. Oh my, spotlessness, radiant, prepared to meet the bridegroom. Amen. For the Bible said it was granted for her to be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. will not rise. Think of this. We'll not rise with canes, &gt;&gt; wheelchairs, or weary size, &gt;&gt; but with shouts of joy, &gt;&gt; with youthful and strong, alive forever more. &gt;&gt; Amen. Think of it. There won't be a blind man tapping along with his cane. &gt;&gt; Amen. For all will see with a better and a superior vision than what we have now. And there won't be one on Hallelujah Square. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm looking forward to that time where the lame will will run for joy and leap for joy. Where the blind will see. Where there be no sickness, no death, no sorrow, no pain, no separation, no sin, no unbelief. All gone forever. Joy. What a reunion. I say what a reunion. &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom talks about it. He says he said in in a month or so we'll be gone after the saints rise. But let me just put it in scriptural perspective. Just as Jesus lingered 40 days after his resurrection to walk, talk, and eat with his disciples. So shall the resurrected saints dwell again with the living bride &gt;&gt; right here &gt;&gt; before the rapture. &gt;&gt; After the resurrection, &gt;&gt; there's going to be a gathering. &gt;&gt; The living bride will gather with the resurrected saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. We will embrace. &gt;&gt; We will sing. I'm sure there's going to be some shouting &gt;&gt; and some dancing and not a shadow of death. Nowhere. &gt;&gt; No more pain, no more trials, &gt;&gt; no more goodbyes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just life. Real life. Eternal life. Face to face with those we love marching together to meet the Lord in the air under the banner of the message of our age. &gt;&gt; Wow. a procession. [Music] &gt;&gt; And so shall we ever be with the Lord. &gt;&gt; And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. &gt;&gt; This is the word of God. Is the divine promise for the harvest time. &gt;&gt; It will be home at last. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Now, this world really isn't my home. &gt;&gt; Yeah, the earth is. We'll come back and dwell on it. &gt;&gt; But this old world that we live in, the cosmos and the evil age is not our home. We don't feel at home here. We realize we're citizens of another land. &gt;&gt; But what began as a whisper in Eden ends with a shout from heaven. What started with seeds sown ends with a harvest. &gt;&gt; What was sown in weakness raises up in power. I'm quoting you scripture. What was failed in mystery is revealed in glory. And this is not a fantasy of emotion. This is a sure word of prophecy that's made real by the hour. Amen. This is the age of the final call. It is the rapture call. It's the harvest cry. It's resurrection time. And I want to say friends, it's rejoicing time. &gt;&gt; It's homegoing time. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said in Revelation 20 and 6, blessed and holy is he that have part in the first resurrection. &gt;&gt; There's somebody going to have a part &gt;&gt; in that resurrection. &gt;&gt; But all that men would repent. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The judge is coming and he's coming in clouds of glory. Not just to rescue, but to reckon. &gt;&gt; Not only to bless, but to separate. And that's why every heart should take heed. For the Bible said in 1 Peter 2 4:17, for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God. &gt;&gt; Judgment begins in God's house. This is where separation takes place &gt;&gt; in God's house. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not just talking about separating that man. I think's a terror. That woman, I'm sure, is a a shook. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about separation from unbelief, &gt;&gt; sin, doubt, &gt;&gt; confusion. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Right now, there's a separation take place and judgment begins at the house of God. &gt;&gt; So, let that ring in every soul like a trumpet blast in the midnight hour. Cuz this is not the hour of delay. It's the hour of decision. &gt;&gt; Amen. The judgment's already began, not in the world, but in God's house. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand it starts with God's house first. &gt;&gt; That's right. You see, there's a spiritual earthquake before a natural one. &gt;&gt; What do you mean, brother Tim? Well, let's let's let's take in mind and view the the sixth seal in the the book of Revelation where the sixth seal opens with a mighty earthquake. And of course, we know his judgments are waiting to be poured out in the physical judgments. But all but a but already the the spiritual shaking has begun. First in the spirit. An unseen quake rumbles through the religious world. And before the earth reels with convulsions. The heavens are already shaken. &gt;&gt; Amen. And everything that can be shaken is being shaken. &gt;&gt; Traditions are being uprooted. &gt;&gt; Amen. Tears are being separated. The chaff is being cast out. The fan is in his hand. And he will thoroughly purge his floor. &gt;&gt; The blade, the tole, the even the shuck. They were the stages of former former glory. It's where the spirit of God was &gt;&gt; but left. That's right. &gt;&gt; Think of that. Places where life once was have now withered and died. &gt;&gt; I think of this. How many people, how many churches? Yeah. Even individuals life was once there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it's gone. &gt;&gt; What once carried life has refused to move forward. I want you to understand I don't care how green you used to be and moving with life. &gt;&gt; I don't care how you used to rejoice when the rain fell and move in the spirit with the spirit and as this wind blew through your leaves. &gt;&gt; You see, you must go forward. And if you refuse to move forward, you actually reject to become the full maturity of the word. You must keep progressing. &gt;&gt; Ed walked with God. &gt;&gt; Don't get comfortable on your pew. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't just get comfortable where you are in the station you are right now. It's time to move forward. &gt;&gt; It's time to move upward. Jesus said, "Every plant which my father hath not planted shall be rooted up." &gt;&gt; This is a spiritual replay of Genesis 21. We're seeing it unfold before our eyes. That of Hagar and Ishmamail, the bonds woman and her son. The religious system and the law bound offspring. They're cast out. Ishmael, born of the flesh, laughed in mockery at at Isaac, the child of the promise. He laughed at the miraculous. &gt;&gt; He laughed at God's vision and God's purpose. &gt;&gt; And God declared in in Galatians 4:30, "Cast out the bond woman and her son, for the son of the bond woman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman." Let me tell you for some friends, denominational offspring, let me just say this. Those that are just warmers, &gt;&gt; lukewarm, formal, starchy, who cling to form without power, ritual without revelation, will not be heirs with the bride. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Their mockery of the promised word, the refusal to walk in the revealed truth of the hour, it seals their fate. They will not go in the rapture. They're cast into the tribulation. &gt;&gt; That's what happens at harvest time. There's a separation. But I want to say, yeah, we look there at at Hagar and and Ishmamail and they're casting out. But I want you to get an eye who who is this other woman? Who is this woman that's arrayed in glory? who is not clothed in the sackcloth of denominational bondage but in fine linen clean and white. Who is that woman? Why? It's Sarah. Amen. No longer laughing in unbelief, &gt;&gt; but laughing at joy at the fulfillment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, that tells you there's mercy and hope for many of us who once laughed at the promise, who once was unable to believe, but God turned our hearts back to faith again. and that God is here this morning to turn your heart back to believing again. She has received strength to conceive. She's bringing forth the manifested sons, the Isaac generation, the promised seed, the word bride. She's not to be planted again. No, this is not another Pentecost. No, this is harvest time. Pentecost was the planting. &gt;&gt; This is harvest. She had made herself ready. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, this we're witnessing is not a reformation. &gt;&gt; No, we're witnessing separation. &gt;&gt; The last move is not the forming of another blade. It's not the making of another denomination. is not about kingdom building or or or man-made system, but it's the gathering of the grain. &gt;&gt; You see, Matthew 13:30 said, "Let's both grow together until the harvest." You know what that means? It means now at harvest time, the time of toleration is passed. &gt;&gt; There's a line that is drawn. The wheat must now be gathered into the garner, and the tears burn with fire. &gt;&gt; And the Son of Man is now winnowing his floor. The fan is in his hand, and only the grain, listen to me, only the grain, &gt;&gt; will be caught away. But oh, I remember, Brother Tim, 40 years ago, God moved in my life. Where's the grain? And where is the the life now? Oh, I remember at a camp meeting. I had it. But well, why are you dying? Why are you drying up? &gt;&gt; How come you're not moving forward? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I was justified by faith. I believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. My sins were forgiven." Well, why don't you let him sanctify your life? &gt;&gt; Well, he sanctified me, Brother Tim, and took habits out of my life. Why don't you let him fill you with the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you let it bubble over until it spills over everywhere around you that everybody can see? You're a testimony of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The son of man is winnowing his floor. And this is a warning and it's a wakeup call. So I'll tell you, we need to have every heart to take heed and listen close because God has turned again to the original. Not to start the cycle again, but to end it in a glorified harvest. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride has been called out. She's been justified and purified. And she's been lifted up into heavenly places. She rules with him. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a people that rules with him. Now, &gt;&gt; yeah, we'll rule with him in the millennial kingdom, but right now, our dominion is over sin, over unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. It gives you a dominion over pornography. It gives you dominion over adultery. It gives you a dominion over fornication. It gives you dominion over dope and alcohol. It gives you dominion. It makes you to rule and reign with Christ &gt;&gt; right now. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not in the sweet by and by. Although there will be the rain in the great millennial ahead. But right now we reign with him. &gt;&gt; Right now we tell sickness to leave. Right now we rule over demonic kingdoms. Right now we have power over the flesh. Right now &gt;&gt; I'm talking to a people that are both kings and priests &gt;&gt; unto their God. &gt;&gt; Amen. lifted up in the heavenly places. But the time of the bondwoman's dominion is over. Her child is a wild man rebellious to the word shall not inherit. And this is the final fulfillment of Genesis 4. We are not the children of or Galatians 4. We're not the children of the bond woman but of the free. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, the last grain is brought to maturity. The last name is being sealed in. That's what the Holy Spirit is doing. Finally, that last name on the book to what? Seal them in. &gt;&gt; And the last call is echoing across the bride's heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the and and the last cry out of Babylon is sounding clearer than ever before that says, "Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sin and receive not of her plagues." &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to escape the tribulation ahead. They're going to listen to the voice of God and come out. &gt;&gt; I tell you, church, listen to it. Hear it. Bride, rise in it. It's not a time to blend in with man's systems and man's creeds. It is not the hour of covenant mise. It's not the hour of ecumenism. It's not the hour to take the mind of the world. It's the hour to take on the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; This is the hour to stand with the eternal word &gt;&gt; and oh that men would repent now. &gt;&gt; Today is the day of salvation &gt;&gt; while mercy still pleads. Oh, that they would make his bosom their pillow before the world dissolves in fire and the day of vengeance begins. But listen, there's waves of glory that sweeping the earth right now. &gt;&gt; Waves of resurrection power that are going across the earth right now as God pours out his spirit. Oh, I pray that you'll feel it waving through us this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I pray there not be a service that we're void of his spirit. &gt;&gt; That we don't feel his wind blow. &gt;&gt; Amen. That the Holy Spirit doesn't sweep in and push sin and out and and drive away the the shock. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Separate from me God the chaff in my life. Yes. &gt;&gt; He cometh in clouds, not under heads of judgment alone, but clouds of glory with waves upon wave upon wave of his divine presence. &gt;&gt; Rolling across the earth like the breath of heaven. &gt;&gt; These are not empty clouds. These are not clouds without rain. &gt;&gt; These are not something that's a false promise. Amen. These are spirit charged atmospheres carrying the very life that raised Jesus from the dead. I'm telling you that atmosphere is now coming into the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. The spirit charged atmosphere carrying the life that raised Jesus from the dead is now coming into the church. And I say, "Fill me with it, God. Fill this assembly with it." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let dead men live. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "If the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall make alive, quicken &gt;&gt; your mortal body," I wonder if it could quicken you enough to lift your hand to God in worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I wonder if it could quicken you enough to shout out an amen to God. I wonder if it can move and clouds the joy of the Lord, which is your strength to rise up within you and cry out &gt;&gt; for his harvest time. It's a harvest time where the now he is thrust in the sickle. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The resurrection life is not only reserved for the last day. Uh-uh. It's already moving. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you, it's already moving. It's already flowing in waves of power to awaken those dead in sin, to quicken the bride, to and to shake the living and the dead. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, let me tell you with assurance, this resurrection power that you feel this morning is a very resurrection power that will raise those that are dead in the grave. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something else. It will also raise those that are dead in the spirit. Hallelujah. It's not just those out in the graveyard that needs raising. &gt;&gt; There's some right here in this church. &gt;&gt; That needs a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before the trumpet blast and the graves break open, there must be a resurrection of the soul. &gt;&gt; Think about what I'm talking about. The Bible said in in Ephesians 2 and one, "And you hath he quickened." That means made alive. I'm looking at men and women here today that I can say, "And you heath made alive. And you heath made alive. And you heath quickened. You who were once dead in sins and trespasses are now alive." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What is this quickening? It's resurrection. &gt;&gt; Come forth. Come forth. That is the voice that still calls the dead to life. &gt;&gt; It's the same voice, the eternal commanding voice that stood outside the tomb of Lazarus and cried, "Lazarus, come forth." I want you to know his voice is still in the church today. &gt;&gt; Amen. And even here, this is where dead men come alive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That same voice is now echoing, you know, across the ages, not in the stone tombs or but in the tombs of human hearts. &gt;&gt; Hearts that were shrouded in grave clothes of sin and bounds and cords of religion. Men and women, boys and girls whose lives were slowly snuffed out by depression, fear, and unbelief. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now the winds of the spirit is moving across the church with resurrection life and bringing life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Quickening souls. Let's say God quicken me this morning. &gt;&gt; Pour out your spirit upon me. Make me alive in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. They have entombmed been so many have been in tmbed in beautiful supplers of lifeless churches decorated with tradition but void of his presence &gt;&gt; places where the spirit never moves bound by rituals or creeds and dogmas of men. They lie still and helpless and hopeless. But the word has come. I said the word has come &gt;&gt; and this message declares with authority loose him and let him go. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the message &gt;&gt; and now they rise that rise from dungeons of sin to the glorious liberty of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many can say, "I once was in sin &gt;&gt; and dead and trespasses, but now I am alive and raised from that dungeon. &gt;&gt; I raised up out of the dungeon of despair where I was beaten day after day after day until I was lifeless by the dying of despair. But no longer am I under that depression. No longer am I ruled by that sin. No longer does unbelief control me. No longer I am alive. I've come out of the tomb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can you say, "I've come out of that tomb. I've left sin behind. I've walked past his chains. I'm no longer bound." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Others Others not in church pews but in gutters in the gutters chained by addiction. &gt;&gt; Crushed by shame &gt;&gt; living in death chambers of immorality and despair. &gt;&gt; They too have heard the call. &gt;&gt; Drunkards, addicts, prostitutes, the suicidal and the broken. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Men and women who were awaiting judgment in their own dark dungeon cells have heard the voice of mercy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The door swung open. Jesus signed their pardon. &gt;&gt; The chains fell off. &gt;&gt; The king's pardon was read aloud by the power of the gospel. I'm reading it aloud to you today. Let me proclaim it to you. He who the son hath made free is free indeed. Then fast in the liberty where Christ had made you free and never never never be entangled again with the yoke of bondage. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Out of Egypt we have come and into the promise. Just like the sons of Jacob coming out of Egypt, they have thrown off their slave garments and left behind their old masters. their addictions, their habits, their tormentors, those former task masters of the soul lie dead in the sea of God's deliverance. &gt;&gt; And just as Israel sang a new song on the other side of the Red Sea, so do we lift our voice like Miriam did with the tambourine, singing the song of Moses and the lamb. Amen. She sang, "The Lord is my strength." &gt;&gt; Amen. You said, "Brother Tim, I can't overcome. Neither could they." &gt;&gt; They couldn't whip Egypt, but God could. &gt;&gt; He knew just how to do it. &gt;&gt; He took them right through the baptism of that Red Sea, and they all fell off. I tell you, if you ever get a baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life, your old taskmaster will drown. They can't follow through. &gt;&gt; The Lord is my strength. That's how I can overcome. And he's my song. and he hath become my salvation. The horse and his rider heath thrown into the sea. &gt;&gt; My enemies. My enemies. That pornography that polluted my spirit. A spirit of adultery that haunted me, that dope that destroyed me now lays in the sea. &gt;&gt; No wonder we can dance. &gt;&gt; No wonder we can shout. No wonder because it's victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. No, because our enemy lies dead in the sea of God's deliverance. &gt;&gt; How many has seen your enemies there? &gt;&gt; Amen. No wonder then you can shout. &gt;&gt; No wonder you can rejoice with me today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your enemy is dead. &gt;&gt; And guess what? You are alive. And that which sought to take your life could not do it because God had a predestinated plan for your life. &gt;&gt; And the long awaited harvest has come. &gt;&gt; God has waited long for this. The harvest of the redeemed. And he's not delayed out of indifference. He's not giving out of on his plan. He hadn't said, "Well, I'm just not able to get anybody to really believe me out of this backsliding age of Leodysia." But he delayed it because of longsuffering. &gt;&gt; Not willing that any should perish, &gt;&gt; but that all should come to repentance. And I want to say now from every corner of the earth souls are coming forth &gt;&gt; called out of darkness into his marvelous light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just you know forgive me for a moment if I get too personal but you just look what happened to James Tron. Took a drunk without a sober day since he was a young boy. And one moment, &gt;&gt; not days and days of rehab, but the one moment &gt;&gt; made a gentleman and a real Christian out of him. &gt;&gt; A man that was hopeless. &gt;&gt; Amen. A man that was lost &gt;&gt; put God rich in mercy because there was a name on the book &gt;&gt; that had to be redeemed. He delayed his coming so that he could get in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look what happened to Jason Dagard &gt;&gt; drawn here all the way from Canada and no intention of serving God. &gt;&gt; Look what happened to his precious daughter Alyssa back there. Same thing, you know, no intentions of serving God. Look at him now. &gt;&gt; Look at him now. We ought to be able to see the before and after picture. Come on. But let me tell you, before that picture, before the sin, there was another picture that God took of them and had it in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And every soul of God is going to match what he had in his mind before the world began. And I tell you, if you're not everything you ought to be yet, let me tell you, he will change you and change you until you match that book, he's not going to leave you alone. He'll deal with your heart. He'll work in your spirit. He'll speak to your life. He'll send servant after servant till he catches you and brings you in because he's a God rich in mercy [Applause] &gt;&gt; who will not leave one lost sheep behind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jason Taggard didn't come here to go to church. Did you Jason? Farthest thing from his mind? But he come one time too many. &gt;&gt; And while hearing the word preached The desire for cigarettes, the desire for alcohol, the desire for drugs left. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm giving you? I can give you many more. I can go through testimony after testimony. Amen. What I'm doing is giving you a few witnesses of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; The resurrection is among us. Joe Green, you know what I'm talking about. He's the resurrection and the life. He took you out of sin, drugs, alcohol, everything else. And wipe you clean. What is that? A God rich in mercy. A God who delayed &gt;&gt; and held time of his coming back &gt;&gt; so you could come in &gt;&gt; cuz your name was on his book &gt;&gt; who says I will not lose one of mine &gt;&gt; and I don't care how wavered that girl is, that boy is. &gt;&gt; Amen. If their name is in God's book, &gt;&gt; goodness and mercy is on their trail. &gt;&gt; The Bible said in Psalms 23, "Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life." &gt;&gt; That means to trail after, to chase after. Amen. To overtake and to finally get. Amen. This God is a God whose love will capture you. whose love is so great you cannot keep resisting &gt;&gt; cuz he will find you and redeem you. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said in Matthew 24:14, "And the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached and all the world witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come. So what we are witnessing today is a global move of the message to every nation. &gt;&gt; We are in the time of Daniel where he says that you know that where where that he where he speaks of this being in the last day where where that where once again there is a global move of the message to every nation. And let me tell you, this is not a conversion of the whole world. A lot of times we think, well, we got to convert them all there and we got to convert them all there and we got to convert them all there. No, it's a witness. &gt;&gt; It must be priests in all the world for a witness. &gt;&gt; So the seed is being sown for the final time. The bride is being called out around the world. And the call is went out to every continent. No matter where you go, you know, even right now, um, even right now, Lord willing, God willing, next month, Bethany and Michael and I will take a trip into Iceland. And there we're not I'm not going to preach. It's just a a little vacation time. We're going to Iceland in August. And but already already there's already people who believe &gt;&gt; that are there. You think sometimes, oh, blow blow Iran off the map. Do you know there are believers &gt;&gt; in Iran? That's right. &gt;&gt; Wipe Russia off the face of the earth. Do you know I communicate all the time with the church in Moscow. &gt;&gt; Believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride has been called out around the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible said from every kindred, tongue, tribe, and nation. It don't matter what color, creed, or whatever you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. You come under the banner of one message. &gt;&gt; And we're all filled with one blood. The blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So there is more. This is more than revival. This is resurrection. &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen. &gt;&gt; They've had revivals in times past, but this is more than revival. &gt;&gt; This is resurrection. &gt;&gt; This is not borrowed breath. This is the life of Christ surging through a once dead body. &gt;&gt; So let the graves of tradition burst open. Let the prison doors of sin swing wide. The voice of the son of God is speaking as in John 5:25. The hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of God and they that hear shall live. &gt;&gt; The dry bones dead dry bones of Ezekiel's valley &gt;&gt; are hearing the word again. &gt;&gt; The spirit is blowing. Sue are forming. Flesh is returning. Breath is entering. and the first wave of resurrection. Souls that was once lifeless that are now filled with life. Dead minds now illuminated by the resurre re revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Wave after wave awakening the elect. And so this is not a single shout or or a momentary revival. This is wave after wave of his presence that is rolling across the bride tree. Behold, the Lord God will come with a strong hand, and he shall feed his flock like a shepherd, said Isaiah. One wave will touch a young man that's bound in pornography, and he drops his chain. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's all it takes. &gt;&gt; Amen. One spiritfilled meeting, &gt;&gt; one place where the atmosphere gets charged. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where the cloud of glory comes down, &gt;&gt; where the shikana expresses its power. &gt;&gt; And right there when that one wave of glory, a young man bound in pornography drops his chains, &gt;&gt; another wave moves across the church and finds a cold dead church member. Amen. And suddenly a soul will weep under the conviction and the joy of salvation returns. I want you to know what that is. That's resurrection power. &gt;&gt; Amen. A third wave will reach out and and hit a prodical daughter and she runs back into the arms of her father. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me tell you, they don't even have to be in church for that to happen. &gt;&gt; Just where you are, a testimony of that. It don't even have to be in church. One night in the prayer line, we was praying. his sister come said, "I want my brother serving God." And he was in all kinds of sin and and wickedness. But I'll tell you what, the Holy Spirit got a hold of him &gt;&gt; before that prayer line ended. He was in the prayer line, too, in his pajamas. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Forever changed. &gt;&gt; A dead man came alive. I said a dead man. A dead man came alive. I'm telling you, that power is filling the church this morning. It'll raise the dead. It'll get you cold, backsliden, cold, and former church member and make you have resurrection power within you and you'll live &gt;&gt; and glorify God. &gt;&gt; Sorry, I've been teaching a while, so I'm preaching this morning. &gt;&gt; The bride as she begin to rise is not from cemeteries first. These are the thoughts I had on the way home yesterday. But the bride begins to rise not from the cemetery first, but from compromise, from lethargy, from lukewarmness, &gt;&gt; from unbelief. &gt;&gt; The resurrections, these are the resurrections that begins before the rapture. And you can't go in this rapture without this resurrection. &gt;&gt; It happens first spiritually and then literally. &gt;&gt; Oh, let let us not forget the dead and Christ shall rise first. &gt;&gt; But there is a spiritual rising before the little one. Just as Jesus cried in the garden, not my will but thine be done and laid his life down. So the bride is laying down her own ambitions, her dead works, her cold formalism, her preconceived ideas. She's shedding the lifeless theology or theories rather of church theology. And she's rising in resurrection power. As Ephesians 5:14 says, "Awake thou that sleepeth, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light." Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, it's actually a prophetic trumpet over the earth. You say, "Brother Tim, the trumpets are all the Israel." No, there's gospel trumpets that goes out to the bride and there's a prophetic trumpet sounding over the earth. It's the voice of the bridegroom calling the bride. This is the midnight cry. is not just a call to awaken the sleeping. But it's a call to the quicken, rise, shine, live, trim your lamps. Amen. The light has come. The glory of the Lord has risen upon you. So he says, "Thrust in the sickle and reap for the harvest of the earth is ripe." &gt;&gt; So this is this is the harvest and it's the harvest of the grain from the fields of death. It's a church that's alive, ripening now in the presence of the sun. She is the first fruits of that resurrection power, a living bride. I ask you, what about you this morning? Has a resurrection power touched your life? Has sin been dealt with in your life? Have you felt that wave of glory strike your soul? Have you risen from your sinstained grave to walk in the newness of life? &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life. He that liveth and believeth in me shall never die." &gt;&gt; Believest thou this? &gt;&gt; That's the question this morning. Believest thou this? &gt;&gt; Amen. That resurrection life is in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wave after wave after wave is sweeping. Now &gt;&gt; the question is not will there be a resurrection. &gt;&gt; The question is will you be in it? &gt;&gt; Will you see stones that don't come to life? It's the seed that is quickened. &gt;&gt; Will you be in that resurrection? Will you let that resurrection power reach you? &gt;&gt; Will you let it go past the bitterness of your soul? that ought that you have against another that spirit where that you have now drawn up into a shell and you are now in a tomb and you have closed the stone. You see people don't have to close you in. You close your own self in and you withdraw into your own little shell until you will not move where the spirit moves. &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you friend, every seed of God has to hear the voice of God. And when the voice of God cries out, it says, "Come alive. &gt;&gt; Come out of the tomb." &gt;&gt; Amen. If he can raise Lazarus, who was dead four days, he can I don't care how long you've been dead. He can raise you up. &gt;&gt; That's him this morning. Resurrection and life. &gt;&gt; And before the tombs of dirt are open, tombs of dead religion must first be shattered. Too long. I want to say it. Too long. And even it's now creeping right into our own churches. Too long. Men have sat in pews, embalmed in tradition, dressed in garments of formality, wrapped in grave clothes of man-made preconceived ideas and theology, lying behind stone doors sealed with man-made creeds. &gt;&gt; But I want to hear you. I want you to hear this this morning. Right now, there's a voice that's thundering from heaven and and thundering from this pulpit. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; It's a voice like the one that stood at the grave of Lazarus, not to mourn the dead, but to raise the dead. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to mourn because you're lukewarm and cold and powerless. I am here not to mourn your passion, but to celebrate your resurrection. Amen. You're coming out. I said you're coming out. I don't care how long you've been bound down. I don't care how long the spirit of God has not been able to move in your life. You're coming out of that tomb. &gt;&gt; And there's a bride that is coming out. A bride that can worship him. A God bride that can give him praise. A bride that can shout the hallelujah because she's not dead but alive. [Applause] That voice that said then Lazarus come forth is calling your name. &gt;&gt; Then it was for one man but now it's for everyone that can hear. &gt;&gt; It's the prophetic call of this hour. He's still calling his own from tombs of man's religion. For the Bible said, "The time has come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live." &gt;&gt; Today may be your day to hear. But the Bible said if you harden your heart and you won't listen to his voice, &gt;&gt; you will provoke God and he'll turn from you because this is him in mercy. There are dead men walking until the word finds them. These are men and women who sits in church every week. Oh yeah. morally upright, socially clean, doctrally informed. They know all the message, but spiritually dead. They're like the dry bones of Ezekiel. Dry, scattered, lifeless. But when the word and the spirit come together, listen to me now. Not just when the word come, but when the spirit gets in the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. But when the word and the spirit come together, when the word is demonstrating power, something begins to happen. &gt;&gt; Let me just read it from Ezekiel 37. And as I prophesied, there was suddenly a noise, a ratman, and the bones came together bone to bone. You see, that's revival. &gt;&gt; That's resurrection. &gt;&gt; It's noisy, but it ain't just noise. &gt;&gt; It's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. They say it's emotional, but it isn't just emotion. It's resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "As I looked, tendons appeared on them and flesh grew and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them." &gt;&gt; And then he said to me, "Prophesy." You said, "Brother Tim, why do you preach this?" Because preaching is prophesying. &gt;&gt; It's when the Holy Spirit gets a hold of a man, uses his voice, and prophesies. Prophesy, oh son of man. Nothing happened until the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, you preachers ought to shut up and sit down." No, we must prophesy &gt;&gt; again. &gt;&gt; You see, again, he said, "Prophesy to the breath. Prophesy, oh son of man, and tell the breath that is that is this is what the Lord says. Come from the four winds." That's the four directions. Oh breath and breathe into these slain that they may live. And that's what I cry. That's what I'm prophesying. Breathe, oh breath of God. &gt;&gt; Breathe. Amen. Separate me from the chaff. &gt;&gt; Amen. From the sin that so easily beset me. Blow out the chaff of unbelief. Fill me. &gt;&gt; Fill this house. &gt;&gt; Fill that house. Fill that house. Fill that house. Fill this house. Amen. &gt;&gt; Feel the pride everywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I prophesied and he came. He commanded me and the breath entered them and they came to life and stood on their feet, a vast army. And he said unto me, "Oh, son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel." Now, I'm speaking to spiritual Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride of Christ. Look, they're saying our bones are dried up and our hope is perished and we're cut off. Therefore, prophesy and tell them, "This is what the Lord God says. Oh, my people, I will open your graves and bring you up from them. I'll bring you out of tombs of religion where you were scattered among the denominations. I'll bring you back to the land of Israel. I'll make you possess the land of the apostles, the prophets. I I'll make you to walk where Jesus walked and live like Jesus lived. &gt;&gt; And then you, my people, will know I'm the Lord where I open the graves and bring them up through from them. Bring you up from them. I will put my spirit in you and you will live and I will settle you. I'll position you in your own land, my inheritance. You will know that I, the Lord, have spoken and I will do it, declares the Lord. Let me tell you, the Holy Ghost is not a denominational badge. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not the name of a message church. &gt;&gt; He He's not a chill bump either, nor a religious or even a religious atmosphere. He's resurrection life. &gt;&gt; You heath he quickened who was dead in sins. &gt;&gt; But he'll find men. He'll find dead men in pulpits, &gt;&gt; women dead in traditions, youth bound in sin. And one breath, one spark. &gt;&gt; One word, they live. &gt;&gt; Jason Tyler, they live. &gt;&gt; One word, &gt;&gt; one word of freedom. This is not reformation. It's resurrection. &gt;&gt; It's transforming power at work. &gt;&gt; And what happens when dead men come alive? They leave the graveyards of their former life. They shake off the grave clothes of man-made doctrines. They look no more for living water and broken sistns. They no longer echo what others said. They now hear his voice for themselves. They have heard the voice of the Son of Man, and they live. &gt;&gt; For the hour is coming, and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live. &gt;&gt; They don't just go to church. Hear me now. They don't just go to church. They become the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't just talk about revival. &gt;&gt; They are the revival. &gt;&gt; They don't. And let me tell you what they do. They go from tomb to testimony. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen. And when when that's exactly what happened with Lazarus, wasn't it? He came from the tomb and was a testimony. And when Jesus raised him, Lazarus, he told him, "Loose them and let him go." &gt;&gt; And that's the command today. Loose my people. &gt;&gt; It's the same word that came to Moses. Go tell Pharaoh, "Let my people go." Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, free them from theological wrappings, from systems that bury the supernatural, &gt;&gt; that deny God's power, that will no longer believe in altar calls or prayer lines that brings healing to both the soul and the body and even the spirit of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Loose my people. Let them go from traditions that binds the bride. These resurrection ones are now walking talking testimonies. &gt;&gt; They are living epistles read of all men. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. They are the bride awakened, called out, filled with fire, ready to meet the bridegroom. For this is the hour of awakening. &gt;&gt; This is the hour of awakening. Maybe you need to tell your neighbor that and wake him up. &gt;&gt; This is the hour of awakening. Come on, try it. Put it on your lips. Arise from the dead &gt;&gt; and Christ shall give you life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I saw a cartoon one time of a of a of a preacher with a turnaround collar and he was very aristocratic in the pulpit and you know and he said, "Now I will perform the solemn act of raising the dead." And showed the next picture and he said, "Church dismissed. Maybe that's what you think when I say, "Let my people go." &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, God's calling you out of your tomb. &gt;&gt; He's calling you out of your shell, &gt;&gt; of the place you've been way too long. You see, Ephesians 5 has told us, "Arise from the dead. Christ will give you life." This is the shout before the rapture. It's the awakening cry in the midnight hour. It's not a time of decorating tombs, &gt;&gt; having pity parties for while you're in there, &gt;&gt; calling mourning. Why? You know why that you are the way you are. You know the why you are the way you are? because you have chose to be that way. &gt;&gt; You say, "No, brother Tim, circumstances in my life has made me." No, you you decided what to do with those circumstances. &gt;&gt; And because of that, it's become your tomb. &gt;&gt; But this is not a time to decorate your tomb, &gt;&gt; to put flowers on it. It's a time to break out of them. I'm not going to fire your tomb this morning. I'm not going to lay a bouquet on it cuz you're dead. &gt;&gt; I am commanding you cut out. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not time for bard creeds. It's time for the living word to be made flesh in a bride. Let the dead bury their dead. But the quickened bride is alive. She's alive from the dead and she's marching &gt;&gt; to meet her Lord in the air. Amen. &gt;&gt; Behold a white cloud. Now notice the atmosphere is shifting. Revelation 14:4 said 14:14 said, "I looked and behold a white cloud and one upon the clouds sat like unto the son of man." This is not a gentle cloud of weathered patterns. Th this is not a a cloud that you know draws figures in the skies and you sit in daydream. This is a cloud of his presence. This is a divine manifestation. Jesus said he would return in the clouds of glory. And remember again, Revelation is a book of symbols. So this is not a literal cloud. It's symbolic of his spirit moving. But before that white cloud of his glorified appearing, we also we can see storm clouds gathering. &gt;&gt; We see other clouds in the sky. We see clouds of war and unrest, war and rumors of war. &gt;&gt; We see economic shaking. We see moral collapse. We see spiritual deception. We see nature groaning and these are storm clouds. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. But above them all, above all of these storm clouds, in control of everything, one sits enthroned, crowned with gold, holding a sickle. Not a scepter of mercy this time, but a sickle for reaping. And he's not shown now walking in the midst of the candlestick. He's seating here ruling. And the golden crown shows in this scene of John's vision that he's not coming as lamb only. But he is now judge, harvester, king. His gold speaks of his divinity. The crown speaks of his sovereignty. The sickle speaks of finality. He has legal authority to reap. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? because he redeemed the field with his own blood. &gt;&gt; And now he comes to gather what belongs to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The time has come. Thrust in thy sickle. You see, the harvest of the earth is ripe. It's not seed time. This is not waiting time. The long waiting of the seven ages is over. We've come to the end. This is harvest time. And the word ripe here in the Greek literally means dried up, overripe, past due, as in as in now no more delay. You can't wait any longer. There comes a time that God says, "I won't wait no longer." How many times have we sung the song, Wait a Little Jesus, there's so many of our loved ones out in sin, wait a little longer, please Jesus, a few more days to get our loved ones in. But one day that comes to a halt, &gt;&gt; the wait is over &gt;&gt; and the fruit. Now unlike a fig, unlike a plum, unlike a apple gets overripe is ruined. But like the grain, all it can do is just seal the life into it. And his extended mercy, God has waited, but now the cup is full. And the cup of iniquity has now reached its limit. &gt;&gt; And and now the tears are being exposed. And what is to be harvested? The bride. For he says in Matthew 13:30, "Gather the wheat into my barn." You see, these are elect. The word seed children matured and ripened by the sunlight of the revealed truth. This is the rapture harvest. A gathered together of the final sheath, a bride made ready. Revelation 19:7. You see, the sickle is sharp. It cuts cleanly. There's no struggle. She's ready. And the tears and the wheat become separated. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says, "Let them both grow together." But now tolerance is over. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And in the time of harvest, when tolerance is over, I'll say, "Gather ye first the tears." And then gather them into bones to burn them. And these are the religious systems, the apostate churches, carnal believers that rejected the word of the hour. Amen. You can do let me let me tell you, you can sit on a pew like this morning and reject the word of the hour. &gt;&gt; Not allow it to have its effect in your life. &gt;&gt; Rejection is not just an outright condemnation. Say, "I don't believe it." But it's a refusal to walk in it. &gt;&gt; They're bundled. These carnal believers that rejected the word of the hour are bundled. They're not raptured. They're organized and grouped by an ecumenical spirit for burning, not preserving. And let me tell you, these are not atheist, &gt;&gt; but having a form of godliness, &gt;&gt; yet deny his power. &gt;&gt; And the harvest is not just a time of gathering. It's a time of divine separation. where the line is drawn between the true and the false. Because the sunlight of the revelation is maturing the grain and as the week comes to its full ripeness, the tears manifest what they truly are &gt;&gt; because it's manifesting time. So this shows us that harvest signs are everywhere. doctrinal confusion, rejection of truth, apostasy. They're being bound together. But at the same time, a bride is being gathered by the revealed word. She's received the message to purify her, separating her from the chaff of unbelief, washing her by the water of the word. Harvest and harvest bride is rapturing her. God is separating while the carnal church is blending, compromising, aligned with worldly ideologies. The bride is being called to separation and purity and to power. Just as Ruth had to leave Moab and walk in the fields of Boaz, the bride is walking away from man-made system to lay at the feet of her redeemer. She has heard the voice that says, "Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her plagues." &gt;&gt; You see, this is this is command. It's a separation. And not everybody hears it. &gt;&gt; But those whose ears are tuned to the spirit knows the difference between the voice of man and the voice of the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; You see, it says in the Bible, two are in the field, one taken, one left. And where are they when this happens? In the field, &gt;&gt; the harvest field, working side by side, &gt;&gt; singing the same songs, &gt;&gt; going through the motions of religion, quoting the same scriptures, &gt;&gt; but one is wheat, the other is a tear. And as a sickle swings, when the clouds roll in and wave after wave of his glory strikes the earth, one rises and the others left. This is harvest time. You see, not all yet that's in the grave will hear the voice of God and live. at the resurrection before the rapture only the bride of Christ of the seven ages will rise. You say, "Well, what about the Old Testament say?" They rose with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, all of them, they all rose with Jesus. Not one of them was left. &gt;&gt; Paradise was emptied. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh but now, but now we're looking for the saints of the New Testaments to come forth. And let me tell you, we we we we are seeing right now a separation is coming. And God will even separate those that are in the grave because there will be some that will come out and some will be left. &gt;&gt; That's right. And let me tell you something, it won't be like a lot of people thinks, you know, where a bunch of gravestones will just be open &gt;&gt; and and tumbled over &gt;&gt; and the world will know because the bride must have left and resurrection cuz look at all this that the calamity in the graveyard. No, it won't even be that way. &gt;&gt; That's right. He'll pull out He'll pull out the remains of his elect without one one piece of soil being other pieces of soil being bothered &gt;&gt; or disturbed. &gt;&gt; I had an old aunt. Well, she wasn't aunt. She's my mother's cousin. She said, "We live in Houston." and said, "You know, now they're having to the graveyards are covered are are so crowded they're burying one on top of another." Said, "I'll tell you what. I'm not going to be buried in a graveyard like that because if I go first, my husband be buried on top of me and he may not rise and I'll be stuck." But let me tell you friends that the time is when those that are in the grave will hear the voice of God and live. &gt;&gt; Amen. They will rise. They will rise to meet him. And I'll tell you what, this morning, even right now, even right now, there are those that are in this pre-resurrection time that are experiencing resurrection spiritually. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is going through the church raising those from the dead. Let me just give you another scripture just before we close. You know of the sunlight of revelation. The Bible said, "And his son, his countenance was his son shineth in his strength." For the Bible said, "In the evening time it shall be light." Revelation 10 proclaims the portrays the mighty angel, the Lord himself, coming down with an open book. His face shine like the noonday sun. And this tell us that the day prophesied by Zachchariah is a day not quite like day or night where the light was dimmed and truth was scattered but is now given away to the brilliance of the evening light. And what does that mean? It means that mysteries that were once sealed have now been revealed. the types and shadows that covered the clouds that covered his face now are fleeing away and the you remember in the Song of Solomon he says I see him through the lattice what does that mean always we used to see him through the types and the shadows we couldn't get a glimpse of him but now he shows himself with an unveiled face &gt;&gt; as the fullness of the word is made known to the bride and what was only symbol is now substance &gt;&gt; what was veiled was now unveiled. It is Christ the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; What a day we're living in, friends. And let me tell you, the evening light doesn't just shine. It discloses the identity of every plant in the field. &gt;&gt; It illuminates the field. It shows who truly carries the life of the seed and who merely has the form. &gt;&gt; It's not just enough to look like a wheat and grow among the wheat. That's a tear. Only the gain is gathered into the garden. &gt;&gt; So let them grow together to the harvest. And the light makes the harvest possible. Because without the light, there could be no ripening. And without ripening, there cannot be no rapture. But let me tell you, in this hour, there is a word born bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. In this hour, Revelation 10, the book is open and the voice of the seventh angel, the mighty angel descended and the declar declaration, time shall be no more. &gt;&gt; And the ages are coming to the end. And this is a very sunlight. And by the way, the time being no more means there will be no more delay. &gt;&gt; I I'm ushering in my coming. I'm the harvest now. If we believe we're in Revelation 10, we believe now that the delay is over. Amen. The long waiting of har of of growth is over. And now he gives way to the harvest time. &gt;&gt; And it's no longer evening twilight. It's the evening sun and is now shining in full strength. The very sun that shown in its strength in the eastern sky back there 2,000 years ago is now the same sun with all the obscurity, all the clouds, all the shadows, all the false doctrines moved away. and the light now shining in his full glory to ripen you and bring you to maturity as the bride of Jesus Christ, a bride who have made herself ready. I say, let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come and his bride, the lamb's wife, have made herself ready. &gt;&gt; It's harvest time, church. It's going home time. &gt;&gt; Amen. The call is going out. It's reaching out wherever you are. Let it touch your heart this morning as the musicians come. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's bringing life to the grain and drawing a line of separation. &gt;&gt; This is the hour to stand. Oh yeah, they'll reject you. They'll reject Jesus. They'll reject his bride. But God has gathered his elect, &gt;&gt; sealing them with his word, preparing a people for the rapture. I wonder this morning, could it be our heart's cry? Lord, prepare me. Lord, move in my life. Let's sing those last two verses that Timothy sang there of it as well. I thought that was so applicable to what I was preaching. We could talk about more. There's going to be a gathering, a harvest of the grapes of wrath in Revelation 14:18-20. Gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for grapes are fully ripe. And the wine press was trotten without the city. This will be the harvest of judgment, the world system, nations, armies that will come under the wrath of Almighty God in the great battle of Armageddon ahead. These are not just individuals. These are governments, empires, entire systems who have rejected his lordship. And their rightness is not righteousness at all, but iniquity, fully ripe for destruction. And they'll be destroyed in the tribulation ahead. But what about you this morning? [Music] Is there someone today that may be sealed behind some sin, some secret sin, held by chains like Legion was dwelling among the tombs and you hear that voice. He comes looking for you. He comes walking down to your pew. He comes to speak to your heart. He comes to loose you from those chains of bondage and give you a freedom like you've never known. Can you ask him in your life today? Can you ask him into your heart? Can you ask him to change you in his presence? Can you hear this voice? Can you hear the voice saying, "Roll away that stone." Can you hear the voice saying, "Come out. Come out out from among her and be separate, sayeth the Lord." Can you hear him this morning? Can you hear the voice of the son of God and live? Give me that next to last verse. Let's stand as we sing this. Lord haste the day when my face shall be &gt;&gt; the clouds be rolled back. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] from shall sound and and [Music] shall [Music] well my soul. Sing it now to me. It is well [Music] &gt;&gt; with my soul. [Music] It is well. It is well with my soul. As I lead this, brother Timothy, brother Aaron, go pray with us, brother. But the Lord is for thee that I come the sky. [Music] How many can say that? &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, listen now. Oh, the shout of the messenger. The angel the voiceelless [Music] blessed rest of my soul. Come on, sing it now. It is well. &gt;&gt; It is well &gt;&gt; with my soul. Oh God. &gt;&gt; With my soul. &gt;&gt; It is well. It is well with my Have you been sealed with the spirit now? And Lord, it is for thee. The Lord thy come. [Music] &gt;&gt; We wait.
