[58:03] come from Bethany he was hungry and
[58:06] seeing a fig tree of far off having
[58:08] leaves he came if happily he might find
[58:11] anything there on and when he came to it
[58:15] he found nothing but leaves for the time
[58:17] of figs was not yet and Jesus answered
[58:21] and said unto it no man eat fruit of
[58:23] thee Hereafter forever and his disciples
[58:27] heard it and in the morning as they
[58:30] passed by they saw the viig tree dried
[58:33] up from the roots this is verse 20 now
[58:35] in verse 21 and Peter calling to
[58:39] remembrance Seth unto him Master behold
[58:43] the victory which thou curses is
[58:45] withered away and Jesus answered and
[58:48] said unto them have faith in God verily
[58:52] I say unto you that whosoever shall say
[58:56] to this mountain be thou removed and be
[58:59] thou cast into the sea and shall not
[59:02] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[59:04] that those things which he said shall
[59:07] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[59:11] saith therefore I say unto you what
[59:14] things soever you desire When you pray
[59:18] believe that you receive them and you
[59:21] shall have them amen God bless you God
[59:24] bless you brother Aaron spoke about a
[59:27] moment ago about the the event of the
[59:30] last couple of days where that you
[59:32] worked so hard for the young people and
[59:34] providing for them and I want to say
[59:37] thank you and and say add my
[59:39] appreciation for that for all of you
[59:41] that contributed and helped and did what
[59:44] you could for our our young people I
[59:46] believe that they're they are um very
[59:50] vital important to us here in this
[59:53] church and and to see them encouraged
[59:56] and strengthened and helped and and
[59:59] support him to go to youth camps and
[1:00:01] things like that that we do through the
[1:00:04] years is so very very important and this
[1:00:07] kind of helps um lift the strain off of
[1:00:10] on all the other rest of the family and
[1:00:13] and helps to provide so thank you very
[1:00:16] much I was very proud of you as the
[1:00:18] church and uh I thank you for what
[1:00:21] you've done as you know I just returned
[1:00:24] from France with had to fly into
[1:00:27] actually Geneva Switzerland and then go
[1:00:29] over about an hour's drive over in
[1:00:33] through the city traffic into France
[1:00:35] it's not really that's far away it's
[1:00:37] just a a commute to work for Brother
[1:00:39] David mayor who works in Switzerland
[1:00:42] lives in France has a church there in
[1:00:45] France and he has a meeting there every
[1:00:48] October that he's had um for the last
[1:00:51] several years he also has an Easter
[1:00:53] meeting that I can come to and so so
[1:00:56] because I couldn't come to that he's he
[1:00:59] made another meeting for me and brother
[1:01:01] Timothy to come and Minister well I just
[1:01:04] tell them you know when I'm going that
[1:01:06] far away I'm not going without Timothy
[1:01:08] so that's the way it is so um we uh we
[1:01:12] bring him along and he's a he's a real
[1:01:15] good help amen and and in fact the
[1:01:18] matter is I sometimes I don't know if
[1:01:20] I'm there to help him or he's there to
[1:01:22] help me but we're um worked together as
[1:01:25] a team
[1:01:26] and U he certainly carries his his part
[1:01:30] really well they really appreciate his
[1:01:33] ministry and blessed him I I did a
[1:01:36] little teaching over there if you want
[1:01:37] to we put it on YouTube um for the
[1:01:40] people for the French speaking people as
[1:01:42] well as for the American people I felt
[1:01:45] there were key sermons that um that was
[1:01:49] necessary one I preached on the secret
[1:01:52] of his coming and the second I preached
[1:01:54] on we have come to the seventh seal and
[1:01:58] it's just explaining things in our day
[1:02:01] uh things that you know you got
[1:02:03] different areas where there are certain
[1:02:06] problems and misunderstandings and
[1:02:09] things that have caused confusion for
[1:02:11] years and you just try to try to do that
[1:02:14] part as brother brandham saw he said the
[1:02:17] bride as he watched her in the vision
[1:02:20] she got out of step and and um he said
[1:02:24] it was some in the back he said maybe
[1:02:26] some of them foreign ones back there so
[1:02:28] you know we're now I think way in the
[1:02:31] back you know I mean from where he was
[1:02:33] in the vision to now we're way in the
[1:02:36] back some of the last ones coming in and
[1:02:38] and uh some of the confusions that have
[1:02:41] come um through the years because that
[1:02:44] we didn't have all the message and it
[1:02:46] wasn't printed it wasn't available uh I
[1:02:50] try to explain to people back in the
[1:02:52] early days of the message um you know
[1:02:55] know a set of brother brandham sermons
[1:02:58] was about $8,000 and you know you could
[1:03:01] buy uh three pickups for that brand new
[1:03:04] ones and so you know um it was very very
[1:03:09] expensive to own a whole library of them
[1:03:13] and then they were on real to reels and
[1:03:15] very difficult then to really search it
[1:03:17] out so somebody come up and come up with
[1:03:20] a doctorine that you wasn't familiar
[1:03:22] with like what happened in the 70s with
[1:03:24] the seven Thunders it was because of um
[1:03:28] the seventh under doctr went forth and
[1:03:30] got a hold because the messages wasn't
[1:03:33] available we didn't know it we didn't
[1:03:35] have it it wasn't wasn't searchable and
[1:03:38] and so today you know there's still a
[1:03:41] lot that are that have these things as
[1:03:44] divisions and separates them and
[1:03:47] separates families separates churches
[1:03:50] separates uh people from fellowship and
[1:03:53] and they're just era and so
[1:03:56] we spoke there on several things there
[1:03:58] to try to help them in that area and
[1:04:02] there were Believers there from switchel
[1:04:03] and of course from France and um Belgium
[1:04:08] uh Germany Serbia Norway and other
[1:04:12] countries from Europe as well also
[1:04:14] Brazil was a had of representation there
[1:04:17] and and uh a brother flew in all the way
[1:04:20] from India a pastor over there he's near
[1:04:23] hyderbad he listens to our Services all
[1:04:27] the time and said I I just wanted to
[1:04:29] come and and meet you so he he flies 12
[1:04:32] hours across um the continents there to
[1:04:36] come to Europe and meet us there and he
[1:04:39] um he's a had had a very very fine
[1:04:42] spirit I enjoyed meeting his brother
[1:04:44] Boaz ktha and uh then there was Brother
[1:04:47] David iers from Belgium brother friends
[1:04:50] W epar from Switzerland others who
[1:04:53] supported the meetings and and it it was
[1:04:55] just a wonderful time that we had
[1:04:58] together with the Believers there with
[1:05:00] Brother David mayor who's doing a fine
[1:05:02] work there and as you've heard him he's
[1:05:04] a fine preacher amen and we thank God
[1:05:08] for raising up men like that in this end
[1:05:10] time to carry the burden of the word I
[1:05:14] believe we're living in the last days we
[1:05:17] we just had our October's meetings and
[1:05:20] and you know I I'm very amazed every
[1:05:23] year to find people even ministers
[1:05:26] you don't realize it but you know I've
[1:05:29] had I've had pastors fly down here from
[1:05:33] from Indiana all the way from Indiana
[1:05:35] coming down and and um and and other
[1:05:38] places but in particular this one come
[1:05:41] down he said brother tell my pastor
[1:05:43] church but I don't have what you got and
[1:05:47] I need the Holy Ghost and I'm thinking
[1:05:50] dear God you know we got pastors without
[1:05:53] the holy ghost that have never had an
[1:05:55] experience with God and have the dynamic
[1:05:58] power of God to change their lives I
[1:06:00] said you know H how does this happen I I
[1:06:05] you know I had ministers even in this
[1:06:07] meeting here that come to me amazed
[1:06:10] they' never seen a prayer line they had
[1:06:12] never heard us they' never heard
[1:06:15] speaking in tongues or or prophecy and I
[1:06:18] find that very sad I find that very sad
[1:06:22] that we have drifted as a movement until
[1:06:25] the supernatural has become so far
[1:06:27] removed from us and and the least of the
[1:06:31] gifts which is speaking in tongues is
[1:06:33] now even far to many that's just the
[1:06:35] least of them and it's one that Paul
[1:06:37] said forbid not to speak with tongues
[1:06:39] despise not prophesying and it was one
[1:06:43] that Paul said I would that you all
[1:06:45] speak with tongues but rather that you
[1:06:47] prophesy and then he said desire
[1:06:50] spiritual gifts and and brother bradam
[1:06:53] even told us that if you laid under the
[1:06:55] altar long enough sooner or later you
[1:06:57] would speak with tongues it's not the
[1:06:59] evidence of the Holy Ghost it's not
[1:07:01] something that is prerequisite for the
[1:07:04] Rapture but it's something God does it's
[1:07:06] something that you can experience and
[1:07:09] that every believer should desire uh a
[1:07:12] closer walk with God and experience even
[1:07:16] more of God sure we know it's been a
[1:07:18] mockery and everything else but um that
[1:07:22] that is done to it and manufactured and
[1:07:24] imperson needed but that doesn't take
[1:07:27] away from the real and from the genuine
[1:07:31] and I think as a body of Believers that
[1:07:34] we should desire to have a the the
[1:07:37] supernatural among us if if not I mean
[1:07:40] do you think we're just going to go
[1:07:42] along coasting on all the way to the
[1:07:45] Rapture Day and and then all of a sudden
[1:07:47] Supernatural things going to happen with
[1:07:49] the resurrection and and our change no
[1:07:52] it's not going to happen that way amen
[1:07:55] it'll be God manifest himself among us
[1:07:59] as the same yesterday today and forever
[1:08:02] and we should expect that in every
[1:08:04] Church in every local assembly amen and
[1:08:08] then and and so you know as I as I look
[1:08:11] and I see a a movement that is dying
[1:08:14] becoming more and more secular more and
[1:08:16] more to the point where the the the
[1:08:19] things of of the supernatural gospel is
[1:08:22] unheard of and never been experienced
[1:08:26] I I think it's very sad I think it's
[1:08:28] wrong I think it's a something that the
[1:08:31] devil has done to try to move us away
[1:08:34] from the real moving of the spirit of
[1:08:36] God and I think there should be a
[1:08:38] longing in every believer's heart Lord I
[1:08:41] want more of the Holy Ghost you said the
[1:08:43] Rapture would be a refilling of the Holy
[1:08:46] Ghost that we have worked in a small
[1:08:48] measure while the Capstone came down to
[1:08:51] unite with the body but then the full
[1:08:52] power of the Holy Ghost would lift us up
[1:08:56] amen I I tell you I I want it more for
[1:08:58] my life I want it for your life amen for
[1:09:02] you to experience God in a greater way I
[1:09:05] think that is very important I I never
[1:09:07] go to sleep at night I never go to bed
[1:09:09] at night without saying Lord you know
[1:09:12] don't let my conscience be so far away
[1:09:15] that you can't speak to me that you
[1:09:18] can't reveal yourself to me and I I
[1:09:20] think that ought to be the desire of
[1:09:22] every one of us today I'm going to speak
[1:09:25] speak on the mountain movers When Faith
[1:09:28] becomes
[1:09:30] perfect and as we do this maybe maybe
[1:09:34] some will think this is quite Elementary
[1:09:37] and maybe even not needed but I find
[1:09:40] that you know it's it's necessary to
[1:09:44] affirm and reaffirm and to show by the
[1:09:48] scripture of the things that God has
[1:09:52] done in our
[1:09:53] generation and you know when you talk
[1:09:56] about faith faith is not something
[1:09:58] brother brandom said that you have to
[1:10:00] fast and pray for but it is in long
[1:10:03] hours of prayer to have faith he said
[1:10:06] faith is really
[1:10:08] common and and he said you know actually
[1:10:11] it's as common as you go into your car
[1:10:13] and and and and turning the key and and
[1:10:17] putting in the gear you expect it to go
[1:10:19] that's Faith it's an
[1:10:21] expectation and so again he he he tells
[1:10:25] us again that faith is something that is
[1:10:28] that is every believer has well you're
[1:10:31] born of faith and and not only are you
[1:10:34] born of Faith but the Bible said to
[1:10:37] every man and woman is given a Measure
[1:10:41] of Faith so you all have faith if you're
[1:10:46] a child of God and faith is common he he
[1:10:49] liken it to his up hup being um a common
[1:10:53] weed you know and and it's a applied the
[1:10:56] blood would be applied by the hisp he
[1:10:59] said you just reach down anywhere and
[1:11:01] you get a handful of it and he said
[1:11:03] that's exactly what faith is Faith is
[1:11:06] just like this common weed it's
[1:11:08] everywhere you use it all the time you
[1:11:11] don't realize it he said faith is an
[1:11:14] unconscious thing it's not something
[1:11:17] that you're even a conscience or you're
[1:11:19] even aware of but you have faith down
[1:11:22] down on the inside of you but what we
[1:11:25] what we want to do is talk about perfect
[1:11:28] faith and and how that Faith becomes
[1:11:33] perfect and so you think well but if
[1:11:36] it's common and it's there but well for
[1:11:38] miracles and I'm quoting brother
[1:11:40] brandham now for for miracles and for
[1:11:42] healing brother brandom it's some
[1:11:44] different kind of Faith No he said it's
[1:11:47] the same Faith there's only one faith
[1:11:51] and all good things and all things are
[1:11:54] are are original
[1:11:55] so as he as he tells us it is for the
[1:11:58] believer it is the six sense you know we
[1:12:02] you have the five senses which are um of
[1:12:06] course we know for the body is um which
[1:12:09] is uh cast smell feeling here and that's
[1:12:13] for the contact the Earthly realm but
[1:12:17] the believer has
[1:12:19] illuminated by the Holy Spirit his faith
[1:12:23] and Faith allows you to see things that
[1:12:26] you cannot and experience things that
[1:12:28] you cannot experience with your five
[1:12:31] senses and so again if you look in this
[1:12:35] in the Scripture it was even in the Old
[1:12:38] Testament even though Faith wasn't a
[1:12:41] word that was used often in the Old
[1:12:44] Testament yet Paul would say it was by
[1:12:46] faith Noah it was by faith Enoch it was
[1:12:50] by faith he looked back and he says they
[1:12:54] were putting Faith to work and and and
[1:12:58] of course it was that six sense he and
[1:13:00] brother Brandon would preach about this
[1:13:02] he said it was the six sense that the
[1:13:05] walls of Jericho fell flat to the ground
[1:13:07] and and it was the six sense that
[1:13:10] couldn't were the that that became
[1:13:13] activated that that so that the sea
[1:13:16] could not drown Paul when and when all
[1:13:19] hopes was gone and he saw a vision of
[1:13:21] the angel of Lord he came back and said
[1:13:24] be of good courage what was it no moon
[1:13:26] or Stars 14 days a night just as black
[1:13:29] as it ever was the storm just as great
[1:13:31] as it ever was but that six sense went
[1:13:34] to work and when he seen the angel of
[1:13:37] the Lord and then he then he said it was
[1:13:40] that six sense that got Peter out of the
[1:13:42] jail and it was the power of God that
[1:13:44] sent an angel there to deliver him and
[1:13:47] so the six s delivered Paul and Silas
[1:13:50] from the stalks that held them bound and
[1:13:52] God sent an earthquake and shook the
[1:13:54] whole thing
[1:13:55] you see they were operating in faith
[1:13:58] they didn't know how God was going to do
[1:14:00] it they just began to have confidence in
[1:14:03] God and begin to sing and begin to
[1:14:06] worship God and as they did the
[1:14:09] earthquake took place and their stocks
[1:14:12] came loose and they were freed from
[1:14:14] their bondage you see it was it was the
[1:14:17] six sense operating that the fire
[1:14:19] couldn't burn to Hebrew children it was
[1:14:22] that six sense that that operation in in
[1:14:26] Martha that pulled Jesus to bring forth
[1:14:29] the resurrection and and again it was
[1:14:32] the six sense that would CLE cleanse the
[1:14:34] leopard and that would raise Jesus from
[1:14:37] the dead amen it was it was again the
[1:14:41] six sense he said we'll Rapture the
[1:14:44] church one of these days and take it out
[1:14:46] of here into Glory so we're going to
[1:14:49] need faith for the Rapture
[1:14:53] amen and when we we say brother randam
[1:14:56] told us again he said that it was for
[1:14:59] healing for miracles it's not a
[1:15:02] different type of Faith it's the same
[1:15:06] Faith now so again we have the faith
[1:15:10] that is in us now brother Brandon
[1:15:12] preached from this text and and he he
[1:15:15] actually spoke on speak to this mountain
[1:15:19] and and then and where he where Jesus
[1:15:22] said that whosoever shall say to this m
[1:15:25] Mountain be thou removed and be thou
[1:15:27] cast in the sea and shall not doubt in
[1:15:30] his heart but Shall Believe now that's
[1:15:32] faith shall believe that those things
[1:15:35] that he saith shall come to pass he can
[1:15:38] have whatsoever he said then whatsoever
[1:15:41] things you desire When you pray you
[1:15:44] believe that's faith that you receive
[1:15:46] them and you shall have them so brother
[1:15:50] randam tells us in the message speak to
[1:15:52] this mountain he said I believe the
[1:15:55] Church of the Living God is moving into
[1:15:57] a sphere now that's going to shake the
[1:16:00] whole world this is the first time has
[1:16:03] been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth
[1:16:06] to a human being ask anything that you
[1:16:09] will and it shall be given to you
[1:16:12] anything that you desire and he said
[1:16:14] don't you see the words of Jesus Christ
[1:16:17] being fulfilled oh it's going to happen
[1:16:19] pretty soon I'm looking for it to happen
[1:16:21] in this meeting I'm wanting it to happen
[1:16:23] now that that anointing will strike the
[1:16:27] whole Church of the Living God and
[1:16:29] she'll rise to her feet like a mighty
[1:16:32] Army the sick will be healed by a word
[1:16:36] the blind will see the deaf will hear
[1:16:38] the dead will be raised up and the power
[1:16:40] of God will shake the world with the
[1:16:43] Church of the Living God we're in the
[1:16:45] process of it now I believe it's soon
[1:16:48] coming the P I believe it will be just
[1:16:51] exactly that way I believe it's going to
[1:16:53] strike the Church of God soon and is
[1:16:56] going to start a Revival to shape the
[1:16:58] world now again this is then a very
[1:17:04] important scripture to us this one I
[1:17:07] started with it would be it would be the
[1:17:11] substance or the scripture for the third
[1:17:14] phase of his ministry and know we know
[1:17:18] that the third phase of brother
[1:17:19] Brandon's Ministry we call it the third
[1:17:21] pull and there's a reason for that
[1:17:23] because of a vision that he had where he
[1:17:25] was making three pulls and and would be
[1:17:28] catching catching a fish we won't go and
[1:17:30] explain it but just to tell you it just
[1:17:32] represented the third phase of his
[1:17:34] ministry and for the third phase of his
[1:17:37] ministry we know it was the opening of
[1:17:39] the word amen it was revealing of the
[1:17:43] Seven Seals it was making known of the
[1:17:46] Mysteries but at the same time it was
[1:17:49] based on this scripture of and I want to
[1:17:53] get it back to you if we believe in the
[1:17:55] opening of the word it's based on this
[1:17:59] scripture right here that I read this
[1:18:01] morning that whatever you ask you will
[1:18:06] receive amen you speak it I'll back it
[1:18:10] up amen so it is a word it is the
[1:18:14] scripture that goes with the opening of
[1:18:17] the word you see the the opening of the
[1:18:19] word just don't give us more Creeds and
[1:18:21] dogmas and doctrines the opening of the
[1:18:24] word in opens up the entire Bible to us
[1:18:27] therefore we have in there we have
[1:18:30] healing we have deliverance we have uh
[1:18:33] yeah tongues is in the Bible prophecies
[1:18:36] in the Bible every everything's in the
[1:18:39] Bible come on yes there are
[1:18:42] understandings of the Mysteries that are
[1:18:43] there there there are knowledge of the
[1:18:46] word that comes but with that also is a
[1:18:50] dynamic Supernatural power of God that
[1:18:53] is released because the word is
[1:18:57] open and if it isn't the word still
[1:18:59] close to you I don't care what how much
[1:19:01] knowledge you think you have it's still
[1:19:04] close to you because it is evidence the
[1:19:07] dynamic power of God is
[1:19:10] missing so you can claim all the
[1:19:12] knowledge and oh I know I've got
[1:19:15] understanding and we got Revelation
[1:19:16] Beyond anybody else and brother we're in
[1:19:18] the opening of the word well then it
[1:19:21] must have the manifestation
[1:19:28] now brother brandham read the
[1:19:31] scripture and of course you know this
[1:19:34] was a scripture that he was
[1:19:35] contemplating him on while he was out
[1:19:37] squirrel hunting and it was there that
[1:19:41] as he began to think on that God showed
[1:19:44] him the power of it and he did that by
[1:19:49] by telling him to speak and he spoke and
[1:19:53] squirrels came to existence now listen
[1:19:57] we wouldn't believe all of that if it
[1:19:59] wasn't for the thousands of
[1:20:02] evidences of divine manifestation that
[1:20:06] had already come that's it wasn't this
[1:20:10] was not some random preacher just
[1:20:12] getting up and say hey I spoke a
[1:20:13] squirrel into existence this was a man
[1:20:16] with a background in a history of
[1:20:18] thousands upon thousands of visions that
[1:20:21] never
[1:20:22] failed prophecies that never failed is
[1:20:26] somebody with me amen healings and
[1:20:29] miraculous that was uh you know
[1:20:31] Unthinkable to the human mind amen so
[1:20:35] again this is why we freely say yeah
[1:20:40] squirrels were created by the word this
[1:20:44] man took that
[1:20:46] scripture and spoke something out of
[1:20:52] nothing so why would that even be
[1:20:54] important well because one day we're
[1:20:57] going to get a new
[1:21:00] body amen and it's the same thing that's
[1:21:04] right amen you know it will materialize
[1:21:08] that from that other dimension and here
[1:21:10] exactly there come on somebody if it can
[1:21:13] create a squirrel it can create a new
[1:21:16] body if it is if it can create a
[1:21:19] squirrel if you got a if you got a sick
[1:21:21] heart it can give you a new one what
[1:21:24] what do you think that when sister Lana
[1:21:26] was healed of cancer and one day a dark
[1:21:29] clouded lung and the next day clear it
[1:21:31] took a it to
[1:21:33] Creation to create a new new
[1:21:39] cells amen we we saw the power of
[1:21:43] creation that's what it is now so you
[1:21:47] say but if I knew now I'm quoting
[1:21:50] brother brandom if I knew there was a
[1:21:52] scripture that pertained to me like that
[1:21:55] and he's referring to this
[1:21:57] scripture I believe I could have the
[1:21:59] same Faith well he said well my beloved
[1:22:02] friends every Divine promise in the
[1:22:05] Bible belongs to
[1:22:07] you remember the quote I read to you
[1:22:09] here the other
[1:22:11] day that every one of us sees the vision
[1:22:15] when we read the
[1:22:18] word every one of us that that is a
[1:22:21] vision amen that's God's word on paper
[1:22:25] but yet brother when it's taken and put
[1:22:28] on a human
[1:22:29] lips it's the same as deity speaking
[1:22:32] Every Mountain has to
[1:22:35] go so now when he said if I knew there
[1:22:37] was a scripture that pertained to me
[1:22:39] like that I believe I could have the
[1:22:41] same Faith well my beloved friends every
[1:22:43] Divine promise in the Bible belongs to
[1:22:45] you and it's just as essential to you as
[1:22:48] it was to
[1:22:50] him you find One Promise here that God
[1:22:53] has made and all all heavens and earth
[1:22:55] will pass away before that promise would
[1:22:57] ever fail to act in your
[1:22:59] stead because it's through the believer
[1:23:02] whosoever will may come and be partakers
[1:23:05] of it and I think that one of the main
[1:23:08] things that causes us to miss the
[1:23:11] blessing are you with
[1:23:13] me and remember faith comes by hearing
[1:23:16] hearing the word of God and the reason
[1:23:18] that we miss it is we don't feed on it
[1:23:21] enough Jesus said man shall not live by
[1:23:24] bread alone but by every word that
[1:23:27] proceeded out of the mouth of God let me
[1:23:29] let me shorten that for you man shall
[1:23:31] live by every
[1:23:32] word amen so man shall have his Daily
[1:23:36] Bread by the word of God but we try to
[1:23:38] make it more and less some far off
[1:23:40] promise way away in some other age but
[1:23:45] the Bible said now we're the sons of God
[1:23:48] not we will be we are now and God has
[1:23:51] not made it
[1:23:53] complicated and many people try to think
[1:23:56] of that way that it's complicated
[1:23:57] therefore they miss the real blessing of
[1:23:59] the word by trying to make it some hard
[1:24:02] thing and my purpose is to reveal to you
[1:24:05] the best I can by his blessed word that
[1:24:07] God is not complicated in any way the
[1:24:09] believer makes it complicated and God
[1:24:12] makes it simple so what do we do we
[1:24:15] complicate things and we complicate it
[1:24:20] by by taking things which is doubt and
[1:24:24] trying to mix it with our
[1:24:26] faith now there's a great misconception
[1:24:30] about perfect Faith too many have made
[1:24:32] it complicated perfect faith has been
[1:24:35] thought by some to be something only a
[1:24:38] prophet could have and this is this is
[1:24:42] unbelief that that is these are direct
[1:24:46] direct attacks from those demons that
[1:24:49] are released from the Euphrates that are
[1:24:53] coming against us in this day now I I
[1:24:55] want you to we have been talking about
[1:24:57] Revelation 9 but it is so pertinent to
[1:25:00] us in this day I want you to know hell
[1:25:03] has been
[1:25:05] Unleashed amen now and he he said those
[1:25:09] Spirits there were bound with tradition
[1:25:12] that it can't let loose because it's
[1:25:14] against Christian principles and it's
[1:25:16] still the same ungodly Pagan spirit and
[1:25:19] that spirit is caught into the nations
[1:25:22] of the world and he said while this
[1:25:24] group has got here 2,000 bound at the
[1:25:29] Euphrates and has been bound for 2,000
[1:25:31] years also the church listen the church
[1:25:35] has bound the Holy Ghost for nearly
[1:25:39] 2,000
[1:25:40] years under martyrdom back there and
[1:25:43] under the church ages it's been bound
[1:25:46] not at the river Euphrates but at the
[1:25:49] door of Creeds and dogmas so just as
[1:25:52] those Spirits were hindered from coming
[1:25:54] over into the promised land even so
[1:25:57] there are spirits released and brother
[1:26:00] Brandon said it's not the rivers
[1:26:01] Euphrates it's the doors of Creeds and
[1:26:04] dogmas that will bind and hinder the
[1:26:08] Holy Spirit from working in his
[1:26:11] people amen now so you see that he said
[1:26:14] that the Holy Spirit can't work in the
[1:26:17] church because of man-made
[1:26:21] systems and she's going to be liberated
[1:26:24] she's coming back that's what the Bible
[1:26:26] said in the two meet one another on the
[1:26:29] Battlegrounds Lucifer and Michael again
[1:26:31] like in the beginning they've been bound
[1:26:33] for 2,000 years for almost 2,000 years
[1:26:37] now so here we are been
[1:26:39] bound at the doors of Creeds and dogmas
[1:26:43] but as brother brandham tells us in that
[1:26:45] message she's going to be
[1:26:47] liberated the holy spirit is being
[1:26:50] liberated and there's a people amen
[1:26:53] entered into every promise that God has
[1:26:56] in his
[1:26:59] word now I'm just going to show you
[1:27:02] these Creeds and dogmas I'm going to
[1:27:04] show you a door I just went on today you
[1:27:08] know yesterday actually I went onto a
[1:27:11] website called Christian
[1:27:13] christianity.com
[1:27:16] and you know in it's it has a tradition
[1:27:20] and established thinking of modern
[1:27:22] Babylonian Christianity to day and like
[1:27:25] the spirits Bound in
[1:27:27] Euphrates these get Bound in the rivers
[1:27:30] of unbelief and
[1:27:33] unfortunately these tried to hinder the
[1:27:36] elect from going into the promised land
[1:27:40] of the
[1:27:41] Bible so you know I I went on this site
[1:27:44] just to see it's christianity.com and
[1:27:47] they were explaining how the early
[1:27:50] church began how it began with signs and
[1:27:54] wonders and the miraculous and the
[1:27:56] moving of the spirit now you know by the
[1:27:59] prophets teaching that what they were
[1:28:01] there we are to be that same kind of
[1:28:04] church in the end time that the seed
[1:28:08] planted will match the seed harvested or
[1:28:12] vice versa now so in this in this they
[1:28:16] that we're talking about laying on a
[1:28:18] hands and this is why I went there I
[1:28:20] went to see what they said about laying
[1:28:22] on their hands and they talked about the
[1:28:25] early Christians and laying on their
[1:28:27] hands and it's worth noting they say
[1:28:29] however that even as early as the
[1:28:31] beginning of the 2 Century only the
[1:28:35] apostles were able to physically lay
[1:28:38] hands on others in order to empower them
[1:28:41] with the Holy Spirit such as in the case
[1:28:43] of the Apostles Peter and John traveling
[1:28:46] to Samaria in order to perform this
[1:28:48] ritual so again they they tell you this
[1:28:53] die
[1:28:54] with the death of the
[1:28:58] Apostles this is what they're saying and
[1:29:01] and said you know it's shown Peter and
[1:29:04] John they had this this gift so they go
[1:29:08] down to Samaria on them that had
[1:29:09] believed and baptized and they they laid
[1:29:12] hands on them and they were filled with
[1:29:13] the Holy Ghost and the Bible said and
[1:29:16] they spake with tongues and
[1:29:17] prophesied and said you know and he said
[1:29:21] that only they you see the apostle Peter
[1:29:24] and John traveling to Samaria in order
[1:29:27] to perform this ritual given the fact
[1:29:30] that the church had not completed its
[1:29:33] embryonic stage it was actually the
[1:29:36] miraculous gift of the Holy Ghost that
[1:29:40] was meant to confirm the validity of the
[1:29:43] message that had been once delivered uh
[1:29:47] that had been delivered once and for all
[1:29:49] by the apostles so he said they said
[1:29:52] these miraculous gifts they were to
[1:29:54] confirm the validity of the message that
[1:29:58] had been delivered it's important to
[1:30:00] remember that these gifts were
[1:30:04] temporary due to the fact that the
[1:30:07] apostles were commissioned to deliver
[1:30:09] the word of the New
[1:30:12] Covenant and it's clearly stated in
[1:30:14] first thessal 1 Corinthians
[1:30:17] 138-10 that Miracles are temporary gifts
[1:30:20] from the spirit and they're only to be
[1:30:22] used for limit
[1:30:26] time now this is this is where they're
[1:30:29] getting this from they take the
[1:30:32] scripture where Paul said in our
[1:30:35] perfected State when we are
[1:30:38] changed when we know as we are known
[1:30:42] when we enter into that perfected State
[1:30:45] and our bodies are changed we won't need
[1:30:49] any more prophecies we won't need
[1:30:51] healings we need won't need work of
[1:30:55] Miracles but you see they say it was for
[1:30:59] limited time and it stopped back there
[1:31:02] this is what brother Bram dealt with
[1:31:04] over and over and over his entire
[1:31:07] Ministry days of Miracles are
[1:31:11] passed the age of the Apostles are
[1:31:16] over and this is what he he had to come
[1:31:20] against over and over he was fighting
[1:31:23] against this
[1:31:24] unbelief just to get people
[1:31:27] healed just to get people filled with
[1:31:30] the
[1:31:31] spirit because you see you see the doors
[1:31:35] of Creeds and dogmas had sealed it up
[1:31:39] from the people this is not the Bible
[1:31:42] the Bible doesn't teach this they take
[1:31:45] scripture and they apply scripture and
[1:31:48] I'll tell you why they do it cuz they
[1:31:50] don't have it
[1:31:55] they don't have it amen and because they
[1:31:58] don't have it then they make reasons
[1:32:02] why it's not needed that's right so he
[1:32:07] says so they say there is no one today
[1:32:10] who has the miraculous power to lay
[1:32:12] hands on the sick in order to heal them
[1:32:14] owing to the primary reason for the
[1:32:16] apostles having the miraculous power to
[1:32:19] lay hands on the sick and the fact that
[1:32:21] the miraculous gifts have seed with the
[1:32:24] Revelation and the completion of the
[1:32:27] will of God through Jesus Christ which
[1:32:30] is evident in scripture and then they go
[1:32:32] on to say Jesus healed the sick
[1:32:34] especially the termin terminally ill he
[1:32:37] encouraged the early Christians to do
[1:32:39] the same this is their writing and when
[1:32:42] the early stages of Christianity began
[1:32:45] the apostles were temporarily given the
[1:32:48] power to heal leprosy by laying their
[1:32:50] hands on it after the time when the the
[1:32:54] scripture began to be written down this
[1:32:57] power ceased to
[1:33:02] exist now
[1:33:05] this this is a demonic
[1:33:08] attack that's right trying to bind the
[1:33:12] Holy
[1:33:14] Spirit which the message
[1:33:20] liberates but they want to bind the Holy
[1:33:23] Spirit to keep it from doing its
[1:33:27] work now these demonic attacks is
[1:33:30] against the bride of Christ and they
[1:33:32] continue I I I regret to say this but
[1:33:35] they continue to be hurled like bombs
[1:33:37] and even some from from those in the
[1:33:40] message Community saying we now have the
[1:33:43] perfect word same thing you know that
[1:33:47] that that only happened to vindicate the
[1:33:49] message so all the Divine Healing all
[1:33:52] the miraculous all the thing was only
[1:33:54] done to vindicate it once it Vindicated
[1:33:56] we don't need it no
[1:33:59] more because now we have the perfect
[1:34:02] word so things like speaking in tongues
[1:34:04] or gifts of the Spirit or Gifts of
[1:34:06] healing are all over since we now have
[1:34:08] the perfect word well you know I will
[1:34:12] say this I I I I've got a couple of
[1:34:16] things to say about it but if if all of
[1:34:19] that is over the gift of healing listen
[1:34:21] the most massive divine heal and move
[1:34:24] that will ever be will be the change of
[1:34:27] our
[1:34:31] bodies healing now you got a bad heart
[1:34:34] God May fix that one you got cancer in
[1:34:37] the bloodstream God will remove it you
[1:34:40] got bad eyes he'll give you New Vision
[1:34:42] but he don't fix the rest of the body
[1:34:45] you come up 80 years old and you walk
[1:34:47] home 80 years old it doesn't change your
[1:34:50] body but in that Divine Healing yeah
[1:34:55] you're going to be changed in a moment
[1:34:57] in a twinkling of an ey gray hair will
[1:34:59] come back the right color come on Amen
[1:35:03] missing limbs will be restored that's
[1:35:06] all a part of this word that has been
[1:35:10] released in the end
[1:35:14] time now but these are wounds from the
[1:35:18] pulpit as the effects of the Gospel is
[1:35:21] crucified notice you can't crucify the
[1:35:24] Bible you can burn it if you wanted to
[1:35:26] you can put it on a pole you wanted to
[1:35:28] but you can't crucify the Bible you
[1:35:30] can't crucify Christ once again he
[1:35:34] cannot be crucified again but you can
[1:35:36] crucify the
[1:35:39] effects and that's where the crucifixion
[1:35:41] takes place is against the effects of
[1:35:46] the
[1:35:48] Gospel so they don't take away your
[1:35:52] Bible they don't burn it they don't
[1:35:55] forbid you to read it they just crucify
[1:35:59] the effects of
[1:36:01] it and this is why brother brandham as a
[1:36:05] prophet of God to the the seventh angel
[1:36:08] indicted this generation that's right he
[1:36:12] did it for crucifying Christ the second
[1:36:15] time
[1:36:16] right and he took the scripture you know
[1:36:19] there they crucified him he said there
[1:36:21] in Jerusalem they the most holy people
[1:36:24] so the most holy city the most holy
[1:36:26] people crucified the most awful death
[1:36:29] him the Prince of
[1:36:31] Life and he said they're doing the same
[1:36:34] thing now
[1:36:35] listen the the the G the Jewish age
[1:36:40] ended out with the crucifixion of Christ
[1:36:43] the Gentile age ends with the
[1:36:46] crucifixion of Christ but you cannot
[1:36:49] crucify the man
[1:36:53] and back to that the matter you know
[1:36:55] they loved the
[1:36:58] word they did they were so careful with
[1:37:02] the you know so careful with it I mean
[1:37:05] if they messed up one little bit and had
[1:37:07] to scratch something out the whole thing
[1:37:08] was
[1:37:10] burned it had to be written copied
[1:37:13] perfectly they knew it so well it said
[1:37:16] that they could roll up their scroll and
[1:37:17] run a pin through it and tell you which
[1:37:19] one what words it went through they
[1:37:22] loved the written word but they hated
[1:37:26] the word made
[1:37:30] flesh the man of Galilee today it's the
[1:37:35] opposite come
[1:37:37] on Amen what will they do they love the
[1:37:41] man of Galilee oh Jesus oh Jesus the
[1:37:45] love the lovely kind wonderful
[1:37:49] Jesus but they crucify his word
[1:37:55] how do they do it by
[1:37:58] denying its parts and removing Parts
[1:38:02] Jesus said if you love me keep my
[1:38:05] Commandments I love God brother de well
[1:38:07] keep his Commandments this is how we
[1:38:09] know you love God you keep his
[1:38:12] Commandments well I tell you I don't
[1:38:15] think it matters about my hair well okay
[1:38:19] you don't love him that's your problem
[1:38:22] you ever get in love with Jesus things
[1:38:25] about the word come on will no longer be
[1:38:28] be
[1:38:29] questionable is that right now so again
[1:38:33] you know brother brandham in the
[1:38:34] indictment he said today where they're
[1:38:36] taking some man's word which is a lie in
[1:38:39] the way of death and refusing to take
[1:38:41] the way of life God's word I condemn
[1:38:44] this generation I indict it in the word
[1:38:46] of the Lord that they're wrong they're
[1:38:48] guilty of crucifixion or trying to
[1:38:51] crucify the spirit they call reev for
[1:38:54] Revival everywhere and how you going to
[1:38:57] have a Revival when the word itself
[1:38:59] can't work through the people I like for
[1:39:02] someone to answer that for me how can
[1:39:05] you can it do it when you deny the very
[1:39:08] Revival itself well did the prophet
[1:39:11] speak of them forms of godliness their
[1:39:14] own forms back there denied the Word of
[1:39:16] Life their own forms today deny the same
[1:39:19] thing that can bring them a Revival
[1:39:21] their Creeds and forms yes sir they take
[1:39:23] the denomination and their Creeds
[1:39:25] instead of the word and that crucifies
[1:39:27] his word and makes his word of no effect
[1:39:31] to the people when they see the word of
[1:39:33] God so vividly and just Place itself
[1:39:37] that God made the promise that he would
[1:39:39] do that and here he's doing it and they
[1:39:41] make fun of it and get away from it it's
[1:39:43] blasphemy they try to crucify the word
[1:39:46] itself how why do they crucify they
[1:39:49] can't crucify the word no more they can
[1:39:51] crucify God they could crucify the body
[1:39:54] that held God the Son of God they could
[1:39:56] crucify that but they can't crucify God
[1:39:58] he had to be that time on account of
[1:40:00] being the sacrifice to bring in many
[1:40:03] sons that predestinated to eternal life
[1:40:06] they had to do it then but they can't do
[1:40:07] it now they can't do it for the word
[1:40:10] itself will live on what did they do how
[1:40:13] did they do they form what are you
[1:40:15] saying preacher how you building your
[1:40:18] platform that they're they crucify him
[1:40:20] then they're crucifying the effects of
[1:40:24] the Gospel upon the people by their
[1:40:28] Creeds that's the crucifixions that's
[1:40:30] where the public sets in these big mors
[1:40:33] called churches denominations draw lines
[1:40:37] of a Creed and the the word of God can't
[1:40:40] have an effect upon them because they
[1:40:43] would condemn the very things that
[1:40:45] Christ said would take place it just
[1:40:47] don't come according to their
[1:40:51] Creed oh they have crucify ified the
[1:40:53] effects of the word They Crucified how
[1:40:55] do they crucify the word when Jesus said
[1:40:59] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:41:01] forever Hebrews 138 they say in such a
[1:41:05] way he
[1:41:09] is and Jesus said his last commission to
[1:41:13] the church go into all the world go into
[1:41:16] all the World Mark 16 preach the gospel
[1:41:18] these signs shall followed them that
[1:41:20] believe and all the world and every
[1:41:22] creature in had half reached yet and
[1:41:24] there's a million do every year that
[1:41:25] don't never heard the name of Jesus so
[1:41:28] it's still the general orders it is
[1:41:30] still a commandment of God Amen all the
[1:41:34] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:41:36] creature that he that believeth and his
[1:41:39] baptized shall be saved he that
[1:41:40] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:41:42] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:41:45] watch now in my name they will cast out
[1:41:49] Devils amen they shall speak with new
[1:41:52] tongues
[1:41:53] if they take up serpents or drink deadly
[1:41:56] things it shall not harm them if they
[1:41:58] lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:42:01] recover and they say that was for that
[1:42:05] generation and they make the Commandment
[1:42:07] of God of none effect of this and they
[1:42:10] crucify the effect of the word to the
[1:42:15] people
[1:42:16] so we come right on
[1:42:19] down and then you hear no more prayer
[1:42:22] lines and you you he people's never seen
[1:42:25] one people's never been a part of one
[1:42:27] people's never experienced it laying on
[1:42:30] of hands it's just a tradition where you
[1:42:34] where you pray to God for Providence or
[1:42:37] God's Will and and you just offer
[1:42:39] encouragement you know that that's
[1:42:41] that's what happens today when many
[1:42:44] times when prayer is given for those
[1:42:46] that are sick they're just offering
[1:42:48] encouragement and asking for God's will
[1:42:50] to be
[1:42:51] done there's no
[1:42:53] expectation of
[1:42:56] healing because the days of its
[1:43:02] past now I want you to say it's not a
[1:43:08] tradition it is I'm what shall I say it
[1:43:11] like this I want to correct that I want
[1:43:13] to say it's not just a tradition it is a
[1:43:17] principal doctrine of the church and
[1:43:20] it's something Jesus commissioned
[1:43:24] not only for the apostles but for
[1:43:26] believers to do these signs shall follow
[1:43:30] them
[1:43:31] that that are
[1:43:34] Apostles that are the original
[1:43:37] 12 that
[1:43:40] believe amen wherever I can find faith
[1:43:43] and this is what Jesus said will I find
[1:43:47] this
[1:43:48] ingredient
[1:43:51] Faith now
[1:43:53] so it's not it's not just a tradition
[1:43:56] it's a principle doctrine of the church
[1:43:58] let me just say it this to you you
[1:44:01] because we we who have the full word
[1:44:05] because all the Seven Seals are open we
[1:44:10] are the only ones that can truly fulfill
[1:44:13] the Great
[1:44:16] Commission I mean listen invisible Union
[1:44:18] of the Bride brother Brandon said they
[1:44:20] they cannot this generation cannot
[1:44:23] fulfill the Great Commission because
[1:44:25] they cannot take all the word they
[1:44:28] cannot take the opening of these seals
[1:44:31] that open up all the word they can they
[1:44:34] part but you can't fulfill the Great
[1:44:37] Commission because Jesus said this
[1:44:40] gospel this gospel must be preached in
[1:44:45] all the world and then shall he end
[1:44:49] come now
[1:44:54] brother badam tells the me in the
[1:44:55] message earnestly contending for the
[1:44:57] faith and he said he says let me die the
[1:45:01] death of the righteous and let my li in
[1:45:04] be theirs you may not know it but in
[1:45:07] this meeting while he's in somebody
[1:45:09] takes a a model plane of some sort
[1:45:13] that's motorized and flies it through
[1:45:15] there to try to cause a a distraction
[1:45:17] while right while he's preaching this
[1:45:20] and he says he's preaching let me die
[1:45:23] the death of the righteous let my last
[1:45:26] end be as theirs and that ought to be
[1:45:29] the goal of us let us die the death of
[1:45:32] the righteous let our last end be as
[1:45:35] theirs if anything let us be like that
[1:45:38] first
[1:45:39] church amen a book of Acts
[1:45:42] church amen the original gospel with the
[1:45:45] original
[1:45:47] word look at that little remnant of
[1:45:49] people down to the age look at it wind
[1:45:52] its way to the of the Bible that little
[1:45:54] church always rejected look at the other
[1:45:57] side so close would deceive the elect
[1:45:59] just as fundamentally right just as
[1:46:01] perfect fine churches keeps the doctrine
[1:46:03] of the Bible so soall they do it they go
[1:46:06] out and say yes sir we believe in the
[1:46:08] birth of Jesus Christ we believe that he
[1:46:11] was a virgin born son of God we accept
[1:46:13] him we have faith in him that's good why
[1:46:15] brother it's by faith you're saved is
[1:46:17] that's right but listen if in accepting
[1:46:20] of your faith God confirms your faith by
[1:46:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you say
[1:46:26] you believe and don't get the baptism of
[1:46:28] the Holy Ghost then you do not your
[1:46:30] faith isn't accepted in the sight of God
[1:46:33] you've got a mental Faith instead of a
[1:46:36] heartfelt Faith a heart Faith that's
[1:46:40] right and when you truly believe God God
[1:46:43] is under obligation to pour the Holy
[1:46:46] Ghost on you and then if he does pour
[1:46:48] the Holy Ghost on you say well I got the
[1:46:50] Holy Ghost too well if you do you're
[1:46:53] bound to believe in the Supernatural
[1:46:56] signs and
[1:46:57] wonders because you added to it that's
[1:46:59] the faith or you say oh no I don't
[1:47:02] believe in Divine Healing I don't
[1:47:03] believe in all that rocket and carrying
[1:47:05] on and believe in all that shouting and
[1:47:07] praising God and crying tears running
[1:47:10] down your cheeks and think I don't
[1:47:12] believe in all that and I know there's
[1:47:13] no such thing as that it shows you
[1:47:15] haven't got
[1:47:17] it that's exactly right and he talks
[1:47:20] about balum fundamental in
[1:47:23] writing his Doctrine was was Moses each
[1:47:25] one of them offering their sacrifices
[1:47:27] and seven altars and so on and he said
[1:47:30] but Moses had healing and signs and a
[1:47:32] big Pillar of Fire hanging over him
[1:47:35] Hallelujah I hope you get that a pillar
[1:47:36] of fire hanging over him signs wonders
[1:47:39] Miracles everything going on Divine
[1:47:42] Healing glories of God and the other
[1:47:44] side didn't have
[1:47:45] it though they were just as fundamental
[1:47:48] as others is that right that's what it
[1:47:50] is having a form of godliness
[1:47:53] but denying the power thereof from such
[1:47:56] turn
[1:47:58] away I want you to turn with me to
[1:48:00] Matthew chap 23:
[1:48:03] 13 in
[1:48:06] here Jesus speaks seven woes against the
[1:48:11] religious systems of that
[1:48:13] day and in this verse it tells of one of
[1:48:18] them says woe to you scribes and
[1:48:21] Pharisees
[1:48:24] Hypocrites now this is a new word used
[1:48:27] in that day Hypocrites Jesus used it it
[1:48:29] was a Greek
[1:48:31] word hypocrite originally had a good
[1:48:34] meaning we don't think of it today that
[1:48:36] a Hypocrites good meaning but in that
[1:48:39] day it was an actor so an actor was
[1:48:43] acting out Parts on the stage he was
[1:48:46] called a
[1:48:47] hypocrite that was that was the name for
[1:48:50] actors Hypocrites Jesus said you
[1:48:53] actors yeah you're you're scribes and
[1:48:57] Pharisees you shut up the Kingdom of
[1:48:59] Heaven remember now the Kingdom of
[1:49:02] Heaven is what righteousness peace and
[1:49:04] joy in the Holy Ghost so it's the Holy
[1:49:06] Ghost so you shut up the Holy Ghost
[1:49:09] against men for you you will neither go
[1:49:13] in yourselves and neither will you allow
[1:49:16] them that are entering to go
[1:49:19] in so this is what J Jesus indicted that
[1:49:23] generation for in that day he said it
[1:49:26] was because they shut up the holy ghost
[1:49:29] from men and they wouldn't go in it
[1:49:33] themselves neither would they allow
[1:49:36] those others to go
[1:49:38] in now so this is where brother brandham
[1:49:41] is saying it has been closed up at the
[1:49:44] doors of Creeds and dogmas you shut up
[1:49:48] the Kingdom of Heaven against men you
[1:49:51] keep the holy ghost from moving from
[1:49:55] filling from
[1:49:57] baptizing come on Church from delivering
[1:50:00] from healing from casting out Devils
[1:50:04] from speaking with new tongues come on
[1:50:07] this is what you do I mean even against
[1:50:10] preaching we're told now today we're
[1:50:15] preaching just push
[1:50:17] play because why men are trying to shut
[1:50:21] up the kingdom of God
[1:50:23] they're trying to keep the holy ghost
[1:50:25] from
[1:50:26] moving but I'll tell you what friends
[1:50:29] for me the Holy Ghost has been
[1:50:32] released amen it's no longer bound it's
[1:50:35] been
[1:50:35] released Hallelujah as brother Brandon
[1:50:38] said it's been bound up now for all of
[1:50:40] these years but now by the evening time
[1:50:43] message it's being
[1:50:47] released it releases to bring forth
[1:50:49] Deliverance healing miraculous
[1:50:55] salvation now in the seed of discrepancy
[1:50:58] which is a 65 sermon one of brother
[1:51:00] bram's last his last year upon the Earth
[1:51:04] and I always say the last things that
[1:51:06] the seventh angel was imparting to the
[1:51:10] church it was the message of Jesus
[1:51:12] Christ remember it wasn't his message he
[1:51:14] was a
[1:51:16] messenger so the Bible said to the angel
[1:51:19] of the Church of leoda which is Angelo's
[1:51:23] messenger and he says now this is
[1:51:26] Harvest Time at the beginning when God
[1:51:28] sowed his seed upon the Earth and gave
[1:51:32] it in the hearts of his children his
[1:51:34] family to keep that word that was their
[1:51:35] only defense keep that word and here
[1:51:39] come the enemy in and broke that barrier
[1:51:41] by sewing the seed a discrepancy
[1:51:43] contrary to the word of God and if that
[1:51:45] was discrepancy in the beginning it's
[1:51:47] still anything that add to the word of
[1:51:50] God is still seed of descri y I don't
[1:51:53] care where it comes from it's from
[1:51:55] organization from military sources from
[1:51:57] political Powers anything contrary to
[1:52:00] the word of God is seed of discrepancy
[1:52:02] and when a man stands and says he is a
[1:52:06] gospel preacher and says the days of
[1:52:09] Miracles are passed that is seed of
[1:52:12] discrepancy and when a man stands and
[1:52:14] says he's a minister pastor of a church
[1:52:16] somewhere and he does not believe that
[1:52:19] Jesus Christ is the same in every
[1:52:23] detail except the physical body same
[1:52:26] yesterday today and forever that's the
[1:52:28] seed of discrepancy when he says
[1:52:31] Miracles and Apostolic age passed that
[1:52:35] is seed of discrepancy when they say
[1:52:38] there's no such thing as Divine Healing
[1:52:40] that's seed of discrepancy and the world
[1:52:43] is full of it and what's now what's the
[1:52:46] statement it crowds out and chokes out
[1:52:49] the
[1:52:50] wheat so just as one shuts the door just
[1:52:55] as those the those Bound in the river
[1:52:59] just as those Bound by Creeds and dogmas
[1:53:02] here the seed of
[1:53:05] discrepancy is planted to choke the
[1:53:09] wheat from coming to its
[1:53:14] fullness
[1:53:15] now I want I want to say it's not true
[1:53:18] that only the prophet could have perfect
[1:53:20] Faith it's just it's just faith that may
[1:53:24] have started out to be as Tiny as a
[1:53:26] grain of mustard seed and and it wasn't
[1:53:29] perfect but then it had the potential to
[1:53:32] become a mighty
[1:53:34] tree and mean you know there's been a
[1:53:37] serious misunder understanding the
[1:53:39] perfect faith we we know without perfect
[1:53:42] faith we can't go into Rapture however
[1:53:44] the faith that we have that we have can
[1:53:48] be
[1:53:50] perfected so whatever faith you have
[1:53:53] this morning can be
[1:53:55] perfected amen so again it it has to be
[1:54:00] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:54:03] Saints that's why Malachi 4 was sent to
[1:54:07] perfect our
[1:54:09] faith Amen to turn us from unbelief back
[1:54:13] to Faith again to the faith once
[1:54:16] delivered to the Saints or quoting
[1:54:18] brother Brams to the original
[1:54:20] Pentecostal Doctrine word by
[1:54:24] word so first of all what is perfect
[1:54:27] Faith it's not super duper unattainable
[1:54:30] Faith it's simply your god-given faith
[1:54:32] tuned to
[1:54:39] Perfection perfect
[1:54:41] faith is your god-given faith
[1:54:45] tuned to
[1:54:48] Perfection you
[1:54:51] know brother Brandon talked about his
[1:54:53] own gift he said now many of you say
[1:54:57] well I believe I believe i' I've got all
[1:54:59] the faith in the world he said you
[1:55:02] don't he said you think your way up here
[1:55:04] but your way down here and he said what
[1:55:07] my gift does by Discerning your heart
[1:55:10] and shows you that Jesus is the high
[1:55:12] priest that can be touched by the
[1:55:14] feeling of in eternity of of your
[1:55:16] infirmity he says it Tunes your
[1:55:20] faith to where it it matches God's
[1:55:23] promise and he said it brings it from
[1:55:25] down here to up here to the level of the
[1:55:31] word so you can have faith even a sinner
[1:55:35] can have faith brother Brandon would say
[1:55:38] that's good faith for a
[1:55:41] sinner right amen you know here they
[1:55:45] were believing but again then he would
[1:55:48] get them to accept the Holy Spirit and
[1:55:50] he says now I call you he said now
[1:55:54] sister go receive what you have asked
[1:55:56] for he said you notice I called her a
[1:56:00] sister what was it because here she was
[1:56:03] a sinner but here in the presence of God
[1:56:06] I'm not talking about brother brandom
[1:56:08] I'm talking about the presence of God in
[1:56:10] the presence of God there when her heart
[1:56:12] was discerned and she knew God was
[1:56:14] present and she repented of her sin it
[1:56:17] tuned her faith to where she was no
[1:56:20] longer a sinner
[1:56:23] but a
[1:56:24] sister it can happen in a service just
[1:56:27] like this you can be sitting there a
[1:56:31] sinner and the word go forth and tune
[1:56:35] your faith and habits of the world drop
[1:56:39] off and cigarettes and alcohol and
[1:56:42] everything else can
[1:56:47] happen amen now so you see it's not
[1:56:51] perfect faith is not a super duper
[1:56:54] unattainable Faith it's simply your
[1:56:57] god-given faith
[1:56:59] tuned to
[1:57:01] Perfection where that you receive then
[1:57:04] what you have
[1:57:06] asked now how do you tune your faith as
[1:57:09] I said brother bradam would would do
[1:57:11] that to show that God was was present
[1:57:15] and and also as I said it happens when
[1:57:18] the word is preached when your faith
[1:57:19] agrees completely with God's word word
[1:57:22] and it
[1:57:23] dovetails with the word that's perfect
[1:57:26] Faith that's when your F faith is made
[1:57:30] perfect amen now so this
[1:57:33] misunderstanding has been taught that if
[1:57:35] you truly have faith well you don't need
[1:57:39] a prayer line you don't even need to
[1:57:41] come no you come for prayer when your
[1:57:45] faith you have faith but it's
[1:57:48] imperfect to make your faith perfect
[1:57:53] it's an action that shows or
[1:57:55] demonstrates that you believe the prayer
[1:57:58] of faith will save the sick and God
[1:58:01] shall raise them up sure if your faith
[1:58:05] was perfect then no prayer is needed for
[1:58:07] you would have what you asked
[1:58:10] for right see brother Brandon said if
[1:58:13] you had perfect Faith you'd look right
[1:58:15] straight to God and believe it walk away
[1:58:17] you never need nothing of even coming to
[1:58:20] a prayer line you have no need of these
[1:58:22] things because your faith has already
[1:58:24] made it
[1:58:26] so and then others will come along and
[1:58:28] say well if you have the third pull then
[1:58:31] then you don't need don't even need a
[1:58:33] prayer line you know how wrong is
[1:58:37] that when when the third P's
[1:58:40] Vision when the very vision of the third
[1:58:43] pull showed a prayer line being formed
[1:58:48] and called and you know the third po
[1:58:50] then would operate in that prayer
[1:58:54] line as they pass through the little
[1:58:56] room now I know that's Greek to some of
[1:58:58] you that don't know the visions of
[1:59:00] brother Brandon's but you know you'll
[1:59:01] get it just hang on we you know maybe
[1:59:04] there'll be something else you'll get
[1:59:05] today but anyway coming for up for
[1:59:08] prayer and and even forming a prayer
[1:59:10] line it is an obedience to the
[1:59:14] word it is part of the Great Commission
[1:59:18] for they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:59:21] they shall
[1:59:23] cover amen now brother brandham brother
[1:59:28] brandham said this says Lord Jesus as
[1:59:30] these people come May the power of
[1:59:33] almighty God Quicken their faith
[1:59:35] immediately as they pass by in Jesus
[1:59:38] name so this was his expectation he was
[1:59:41] expecting Faith to be
[1:59:44] quickened as it come through the prayer
[1:59:46] line now I
[1:59:48] realize that laying on our hands is a
[1:59:52] Jewish
[1:59:55] tradition so well W it up throw it away
[1:59:59] it's a Jewish tradition well what is a
[2:00:01] tradition a tradition is a long
[2:00:04] established or inherited way of thinking
[2:00:08] or acting that has passed down from
[2:00:10] generation to generation so it's a long
[2:00:13] established way of thinking for example
[2:00:15] the Jews did it they laid on hands to
[2:00:18] confer or to bestow a blessing upon
[2:00:21] another
[2:00:23] and and they also would would would be
[2:00:27] commanded to take and the priest would
[2:00:29] lay his hands on a goat that would be
[2:00:32] the sacrifice and what he was doing
[2:00:35] there by that he was he was placing a
[2:00:39] placing God's righteous curse on the
[2:00:42] animal instead of the sinful
[2:00:46] people and they would do it when they
[2:00:48] were pronouncing a blessing on another
[2:00:51] they anointed their Kings they laid
[2:00:52] hands on the priesthood they blessed
[2:00:54] others by laying on of hands so it's a
[2:00:57] long established way of thinking or
[2:01:01] acting passed down from generation to
[2:01:06] generation that's what laying on the
[2:01:08] hands is it is a Jewish
[2:01:13] tradition so is it a Bible
[2:01:20] tradition it's something something
[2:01:22] handed down from the scripture from
[2:01:25] generation to
[2:01:28] generation so it's a Biblical tradition
[2:01:32] not just
[2:01:35] Jewish Jesus did
[2:01:37] it Peter did it Paul did it come
[2:01:42] on I wanted to say to you all Traditions
[2:01:46] are not
[2:01:47] wrong for example here's a Christian
[2:01:50] tradition that we learn from Jesus and
[2:01:53] that is to bless our food as as he took
[2:01:56] bread and blessed
[2:01:58] it all Christians do that don't they
[2:02:01] Paul taught us to do the same thing he
[2:02:03] dealt with the judaizers who wanted to
[2:02:05] keep them them to keep the Old Testament
[2:02:07] law and and and forbid them to eat
[2:02:10] certain meats and so on in 1 Timothy 4:3
[2:02:13] he said they commanded them tostain from
[2:02:15] Meats which God created to be received
[2:02:17] with Thanksgiving which of them which
[2:02:20] believe and know the truth for every
[2:02:22] creature of God is good and nothing to
[2:02:24] be refused if it be received with
[2:02:27] Thanksgiving for it is Sanctified by the
[2:02:30] word of God and
[2:02:32] prayer and if we thou put the brethren
[2:02:35] in remembrance of these things Thou
[2:02:36] shalt be a good Minister the of Jesus
[2:02:39] Christ nursed up in the words of faith
[2:02:42] and of good Doctrine where unto thou
[2:02:44] Hast
[2:02:46] attained so you see as Christians we
[2:02:49] keep this tradition
[2:02:53] Jesus did it Paul did it Paul taught it
[2:02:58] and we do it you know brother brandham
[2:03:01] talked about it himself he said you
[2:03:03] welcome him in your house and let him be
[2:03:06] the Unseen guest you sit in that down at
[2:03:08] the table then and never even thank him
[2:03:11] you eat without even thanking him for it
[2:03:13] he said I see many Christians never
[2:03:16] return Thanks so they're just like a hog
[2:03:19] under an apple tree hog can sit under
[2:03:22] apple tree you know and eat apples and
[2:03:25] those apples fall from the tree and beat
[2:03:27] him on the head he never looks up to see
[2:03:29] where they come
[2:03:30] from and brother Brandon said that's the
[2:03:32] way that people will become in the last
[2:03:34] day unthankful Unholy without natural
[2:03:37] affection truce Breakers false accusers
[2:03:39] and continent Fierce despiser of those
[2:03:42] that are good and and headyy and high
[2:03:44] minded and lovers of pleasure more than
[2:03:46] lovers of God having a form of godliness
[2:03:48] but denying the power thereof so you see
[2:03:52] that that that that is a tradition I'm
[2:03:54] just showing you it is a
[2:03:57] tradition that we do just one of the
[2:04:00] many now so the Jews believed and laying
[2:04:05] on our hands and in Matthew
[2:04:08] 918 when when there was a certain ruler
[2:04:11] came and worshiped him sayeth my
[2:04:14] daughter is even now dead but come and
[2:04:18] lay thy hand on her and she said
[2:04:22] live so this was this was the Jews
[2:04:26] understanding this is a long tradition I
[2:04:29] know this I just come and lay your hands
[2:04:32] confer a
[2:04:33] blessing that's
[2:04:36] right by laying on our hands confer a
[2:04:39] blessing but the Gentiles showed that
[2:04:43] there could be healing without hands
[2:04:46] laid on because he said I'm a centurion
[2:04:50] and he said I I I he didn't have the way
[2:04:52] of the thinking of the Jews he didn't
[2:04:54] have that long-term tradition come lay
[2:04:58] hands so what did he do he said just
[2:05:00] speak the word and my servant will live
[2:05:04] and by doing that he
[2:05:06] demonstrated that g greater Faith than
[2:05:09] even that of Israel you see because he
[2:05:12] believed the word could go forth and
[2:05:15] heal without requiring the physical
[2:05:18] presence of Jesus but the word would go
[2:05:20] forth in the of the spirit and heal even
[2:05:24] without a physical
[2:05:28] touch now Jesus taught by by tradition
[2:05:33] by example and we inherit this tradition
[2:05:36] from Jesus or this way of acting From
[2:05:39] Him Luke 4:40 when the sun was setting
[2:05:43] and all they that had that was had any
[2:05:46] sick and diverse diseases brought they
[2:05:49] to him and he lay laid his hands on
[2:05:53] every one of them and healed
[2:05:57] them you see this happened over and over
[2:06:01] and over again in Jesus
[2:06:05] ministry now he didn't do it once he did
[2:06:08] it over and over and then he
[2:06:12] commissioned Believers to do the same
[2:06:19] thing so we learn to do it from Jesus
[2:06:23] example but I also want you to know it's
[2:06:26] a doctrine of the true
[2:06:30] church so in Hebrews 6 verse one
[2:06:33] therefore leaving the principles of the
[2:06:35] doctrine of Christ Paul is saying I'm
[2:06:37] going to leave these principles of the
[2:06:39] doctrines I'm teaching I'm going to go
[2:06:41] now into deep Waters and teach you about
[2:06:42] MDC and these others he's not saying we
[2:06:45] don't do these anymore he says now in my
[2:06:47] teaching we are going to advance beyond
[2:06:50] the doctrine of Christ we're going on
[2:06:53] into Perfection I'm going to teach you
[2:06:55] some deep Mysteries now of MDC and and
[2:06:59] the sacrifice and the blood and all of
[2:07:01] these things and he says let us go into
[2:07:04] Perfection not laying again the
[2:07:06] foundation of repentance from uh uh from
[2:07:10] dead works and of Faith toward
[2:07:12] God and and of doctrines of baptism and
[2:07:16] of laying on our hands and on
[2:07:18] Resurrection of the dead and on eternal
[2:07:21] judgment he says you know I'm I'm not
[2:07:23] going to be teaching on that now we're
[2:07:25] moving on in our in our teaching our
[2:07:28] discourse on the Hebrews and what I'm
[2:07:30] going to do is we're going to go beyond
[2:07:32] this part but here I'm going to go
[2:07:34] beyond these fundamental doctrines and
[2:07:37] I'm going to take you over into the deep
[2:07:39] Mysteries of the priesthood and of MDC
[2:07:44] and how Jesus fit the the order of mzc
[2:07:48] because he wasn't a Levi and could not
[2:07:50] be a priest at in the order of Levi of
[2:07:54] the aonic priesthood he was of the tribe
[2:07:57] he of Judah himself so he could not be
[2:08:00] that but he was of the order of MDC a
[2:08:03] spiritual priesthood but I want you to
[2:08:06] know I want you to know that here the
[2:08:09] Paul said the principal doctrines that
[2:08:13] we have is
[2:08:14] repentance Faith baptism laying on our
[2:08:19] hands resurrection of the Dead and
[2:08:21] eternal
[2:08:24] judgment so it is a Doctrine laying on
[2:08:28] the hands is a doctrine that rates right
[2:08:31] up with repentance Faith water
[2:08:36] baptism resurrection of the Dead Eternal
[2:08:40] judgment it R right with that it is a
[2:08:44] Doctrine a fundamental doctrine of the
[2:08:48] church oh we're beyond that brother Tim
[2:08:51] we're in the third pull no we're never
[2:08:53] beyond that we are
[2:08:54] [Music]
[2:08:56] commissioned by the third pull
[2:08:59] message to fulfill the Great Commission
[2:09:02] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[2:09:05] they shall
[2:09:09] recover now so not only is it a
[2:09:13] principal doctrine of Christ but he
[2:09:16] commissioned us to do it when he gave
[2:09:17] the Great Commission and said this is
[2:09:20] what Believers will do
[2:09:22] Believers will cast out
[2:09:25] Devils do you know do you know that's
[2:09:28] Healing The Sick every time that we pray
[2:09:31] for the sick we're casting out
[2:09:36] Devils so well brother Tim many will
[2:09:38] come to me in that day and say have I
[2:09:40] not I've done it but he said also you're
[2:09:42] going to do
[2:09:44] it sure impersonators come this is what
[2:09:48] PE people can't get it in their brain
[2:09:50] just because just because impersonators
[2:09:53] are doing things doesn't mean we're not
[2:09:55] to do it they're mocking
[2:09:59] us they're impersonating
[2:10:06] us you said wow brother Jim false
[2:10:09] anointed ones at didn't time yeah but
[2:10:12] the anointing is true and it wasn't sent
[2:10:15] for them he was sent for the
[2:10:17] [Applause]
[2:10:19] elect brother Bram said you know it's
[2:10:22] not the anointed is false it's the Holy
[2:10:25] Ghost that's right well who don't want
[2:10:27] that I want it it's for the wheat it's
[2:10:32] for the
[2:10:33] grain so what if it falls on the on the
[2:10:37] unjust that don't make it
[2:10:39] wrong so what if they shout and rejoice
[2:10:42] the say it doesn't make it wrong I'm
[2:10:44] still going to shout and
[2:10:47] rejoice so what if they misuse it and
[2:10:50] they try to build kingdoms with it so
[2:10:53] what it is for us it's for our children
[2:10:56] it's for them that are far off it's for
[2:10:58] as many as the Lord Our God shall
[2:11:05] call hide behind these that want to keep
[2:11:09] the door closed oh you you you you may
[2:11:11] be one of those you dece the very elect
[2:11:14] now dece the very elect no the elect not
[2:11:16] going to be
[2:11:17] deceived come on read the Bible the
[2:11:20] elect will not be deceived it can only
[2:11:23] do that if it were
[2:11:25] possible but it ain't
[2:11:27] possible we are predestinated not to
[2:11:30] fall we are predestinated to overcome in
[2:11:33] this
[2:11:33] [Applause]
[2:11:40] age let me just tell you from my
[2:11:44] personal
[2:11:45] experience I sat
[2:11:47] there I sat there as a young boy in
[2:11:50] brother Brandon's meeting in his last
[2:11:52] prayer line that he would ever have last
[2:11:54] public one
[2:11:55] anyway cuz I don't know what he did
[2:11:58] privately but the last public prayer
[2:12:00] line that he had on the wings of a snow
[2:12:03] white
[2:12:04] dove I saw him lay hands on the
[2:12:11] sick I saw him pray the prayer of
[2:12:15] faith you tell me we're not to do that
[2:12:19] no
[2:12:19] more we're not to have a prayer line
[2:12:22] we're not to lay hands on the sick I
[2:12:24] don't know what department of demons you
[2:12:27] came from but you're not welcome
[2:12:30] here amen amen I I've seen it I saw it
[2:12:35] manifested now you see I was there I you
[2:12:39] can't it's kind of arue hard to argue
[2:12:41] with somebody was
[2:12:45] there you know I've been an advocate and
[2:12:48] I tell you to do it start with ver this
[2:12:51] the time follow the message all the way
[2:12:53] through you'll have a complete different
[2:12:55] Viewpoint of it you'll see as brother
[2:12:58] Brown built thoughts and the Holy Spirit
[2:13:00] would correct things people expect a
[2:13:03] prophet to be infallible he wasn't
[2:13:05] infallible he was a man if he's
[2:13:07] infallible he's God that's right but
[2:13:10] there's a evil spirit in this message
[2:13:12] that wants to make him
[2:13:14] infallible so you know brother brandham
[2:13:16] would be corrected by the Holy
[2:13:18] Ghost and and you have to catch those
[2:13:21] things you have to see where he turned
[2:13:23] made and and and turned a
[2:13:26] corner but I was listening along to
[2:13:28] brother brandom years ago I was
[2:13:30] listening reading at the same time
[2:13:33] studying it out hearing listening at and
[2:13:36] reading at the same
[2:13:38] time exercising ears and
[2:13:43] eyes trying to get as many senses glued
[2:13:46] in on it to not miss
[2:13:49] it and as I did I'd run up to brother
[2:13:52] Bram he'd
[2:13:53] say well you know my old Pastor used to
[2:13:57] teach he used to teach that now Billy
[2:14:00] I'll tell you here's the way it was you
[2:14:02] know we're Baptist and we believe in
[2:14:04] baptizing everybody's got to be baptized
[2:14:06] and we believe in baptizing we believe
[2:14:08] in immersion that was a
[2:14:10] Doctrine they didn't do it right but
[2:14:13] they believed at least in immersion they
[2:14:15] baptizing titles and he said said of
[2:14:19] course when brother Brandon want to be
[2:14:20] baptized he said you baptize me in the
[2:14:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said
[2:14:23] I'll do it so he he was he said now
[2:14:29] Billy we're Baptist and he said um
[2:14:30] here's what happened that day on the
[2:14:33] River
[2:14:34] Jordan said there
[2:14:37] Jesus you know had to fulfill all
[2:14:41] righteousness so you know it was a
[2:14:43] righteous thing to be John to be
[2:14:45] baptized and John hadn't been baptized
[2:14:47] neither had Jesus so when Jesus B was
[2:14:52] baptized he then baptized
[2:14:55] John and brother brandham said well that
[2:14:59] was good Baptist teaching Doctrine but
[2:15:01] it wasn't that wasn't right said Jesus
[2:15:05] did not baptize John and I said well you
[2:15:08] know scripture doesn't say that it
[2:15:10] doesn't say that he baptized John but
[2:15:12] it's reasonable John need to be baptized
[2:15:14] too well you know going to fulfill all
[2:15:17] righteousness isn't that
[2:15:18] reasonable so you know I I would say
[2:15:22] yeah this is what brother brandham said
[2:15:24] but how did he
[2:15:26] know I mean the Bible doesn't say one
[2:15:29] way or the other how does he know I'm
[2:15:31] not doubting him I'm just wondering I
[2:15:33] mean where do we place
[2:15:35] this and so I put on another tape and
[2:15:38] after another and then he'd come on he'd
[2:15:40] bring it back up again and he'd say the
[2:15:43] same thing over
[2:15:44] again and he said NOP Jesus did not
[2:15:49] baptize John my old Pastor Baptist but
[2:15:52] he had it wrong I said Okay I I I
[2:15:57] believe that but how do you
[2:15:59] know I mean John needs to be baptized
[2:16:02] too so Bible doesn't say one way or the
[2:16:06] other so you know it's
[2:16:09] reasonable I mean give it to the old
[2:16:12] Baptist pastor it's reasonable you know
[2:16:15] but so how do you know I mean you got
[2:16:17] one man's word and another man's word
[2:16:19] and of course you know this is a prop
[2:16:21] you know this a't so you certainly ain't
[2:16:23] doubting
[2:16:25] him but yet you're wondering then I put
[2:16:28] on another tape and he said very
[2:16:32] emphatically again Jesus did not baptize
[2:16:36] John and I stopped the tape and I said
[2:16:39] how do you
[2:16:42] know and I pushed the button again he
[2:16:44] said because one day in the vision I saw
[2:16:47] the whole thing
[2:16:51] Hallelujah you can't argue with somebody
[2:16:53] that was
[2:16:55] there God was able to take him by Vision
[2:16:58] set him down on the river of Jordan see
[2:17:00] the holy VI that's you see we are not
[2:17:05] following kindly divis fables but this
[2:17:09] has been revealed and by the angel of
[2:17:12] God the pillar of
[2:17:15] fire as he said when he finished up the
[2:17:18] seals them revelations in the Pres of
[2:17:21] that Pillar of
[2:17:27] Fire so
[2:17:30] now can't argue with me I was
[2:17:35] there you
[2:17:40] know let's go to James
[2:17:44] 5:14 James
[2:17:47] 5:14 and I'm quoting brother brandom he
[2:17:50] says it is a Divine remedy for your
[2:17:53] sickness if you'll accept it as God's
[2:17:55] remedy so I'm going to read you God's
[2:17:57] remedy the Divine remedy for your
[2:18:01] sickness watch
[2:18:05] this is any sick among you let him call
[2:18:10] for the Elders of the church and let
[2:18:13] them pray over him anointing him with
[2:18:15] oil in the name of the
[2:18:18] Lord and the prayer of faith shall save
[2:18:20] the sick and the Lord shall raise him up
[2:18:23] and if he's committed sin they shall be
[2:18:26] forgiven him confess your faults one to
[2:18:28] another and pray for one another that
[2:18:30] you may be healed and again here watch
[2:18:32] this the effectual fervent prayer of a
[2:18:36] righteous man aileth
[2:18:41] much now I'm trying to tell you today
[2:18:44] you as a Believer can pray the effectual
[2:18:48] fervent prayer amen
[2:18:52] and it avails much because he didn't say
[2:18:55] the
[2:18:56] apostles he said
[2:19:00] righteous come on Amen the righteous man
[2:19:05] his prayer availeth much well you say
[2:19:08] but I made too many mistakes that's
[2:19:10] where the blood comes
[2:19:14] inall amen sure we have many mistakes we
[2:19:18] do things wrong we have to ask for
[2:19:20] forgiveness we we we have to say God I
[2:19:23] you know help me to overcome that let me
[2:19:26] rise above
[2:19:28] it but again brother bradam reads this
[2:19:31] John 5 5:14 he said that's the duty of
[2:19:34] every Christian
[2:19:36] minister every minister of the Gospel
[2:19:39] has a right to pray for his congregation
[2:19:41] they have a right to believe God and be
[2:19:42] healed Divine Healing doesn't belong to
[2:19:45] one man or one group it belongs to all
[2:19:48] the people the gift of healing was not
[2:19:50] given to be sent out to to have
[2:19:52] different healing campaigns across the
[2:19:55] country it's all right for them to be
[2:19:58] but that isn't the purpose there ought
[2:20:00] to be a healing campaign in every Church
[2:20:04] all the time going on
[2:20:10] everywhere
[2:20:15] amen and let me tell
[2:20:18] you the reason we call for so someone a
[2:20:21] righteous man to pray with us is because
[2:20:24] there's power in
[2:20:29] agreement Matthew
[2:20:32] 18:18 whatever you bind on Earth shall
[2:20:35] be bound in heaven whatever you loose on
[2:20:37] Earth shall be loosed in heaven and
[2:20:38] again I say to you if any if two of you
[2:20:42] shall agree on
[2:20:44] Earth touching anything that that they
[2:20:48] that they shall ask it shall be be done
[2:20:51] for them of My Father which is in
[2:20:53] heaven then he goes on to say where two
[2:20:56] or three are gathered together in my
[2:20:57] name there I am in the
[2:21:00] midst Hallelujah so there's power and
[2:21:03] agreement Paul it was Moses that would
[2:21:06] say h you know one man will chase a
[2:21:09] thousand and but two will put 10,000 of
[2:21:13] flight so there's a power when Believers
[2:21:17] come together and they believe it's
[2:21:20] important for atmosphere to be
[2:21:24] right listen healing can be on the soul
[2:21:27] that's
[2:21:29] salvation that's where many times where
[2:21:31] we cast out Devils out of the Soul
[2:21:34] healing can be on the
[2:21:35] body healing can be in the
[2:21:39] spirit that's the mind the attitude the
[2:21:43] atmosphere of your life may not be a
[2:21:46] physical thing could be a mental thing
[2:21:48] it's spiritual
[2:21:50] Devils come drive you to Suicide drive
[2:21:53] you to thinking wrong driving you to
[2:21:56] grudges or to hatred or whatever
[2:22:00] that's spiritual in the mental in the
[2:22:03] spirit realm your body Spirit soul soul
[2:22:08] once it's saved even if you go mentally
[2:22:12] insane you're still
[2:22:17] saved well I know that person I thought
[2:22:19] they were Holy Ghost feeling they killed
[2:22:21] theel well they went
[2:22:22] insane and didn't Chang their Destiny
[2:22:26] God didn't take away his
[2:22:29] salvation but now I'm just going to tell
[2:22:31] you I wouldn't I wouldn't choose that
[2:22:33] for a way out do you can you imagine
[2:22:35] could you imagine me standing there
[2:22:37] before God and God saying okay Tim why
[2:22:39] are you here well I chickened
[2:22:41] out it's too hard after I went to the
[2:22:48] Cross well you quit why did you quit Tim
[2:22:52] why'd you give up why'd you think it was
[2:22:54] too hard well I was just overcome what
[2:22:56] when I gave you the Holy Spirit to
[2:22:58] overcome
[2:23:00] [Applause]
[2:23:02] with and you did this because of a
[2:23:04] selfish
[2:23:06] motive cuz you come and turned Inward
[2:23:08] and was so self-centered it was all
[2:23:10] about
[2:23:12] you that you forgot about all the others
[2:23:14] you would wound and
[2:23:18] hurt now I'm make it to Heaven I ain't
[2:23:21] saying you didn't and I don't saying you
[2:23:23] won't but I am saying this you're going
[2:23:26] to give an account and when I when I do
[2:23:28] I want don't want God to say Tim you did
[2:23:31] really well but you wound up a
[2:23:43] quitter rather than trusting on me you
[2:23:47] just try to take a easy way out for
[2:23:49] yourself you were selfish s because
[2:23:52] you're
[2:23:53] self-centered you looked on your own
[2:23:55] self and your own
[2:23:57] ways don't do
[2:24:05] that brother brandom said in Easter seal
[2:24:08] this is a 65 sermon now if you're sick
[2:24:11] will you lay hands on one another let's
[2:24:14] pray just lay your hands on somebody by
[2:24:16] you regardless of what's wrong with you
[2:24:18] have faith now if I ever told you the
[2:24:19] truth I tell you now Jesus said these
[2:24:21] signs shall follow them that believe
[2:24:23] you're Believers you just raise your
[2:24:25] hand don't doubt there's some poor
[2:24:27] suffering person that's you got your
[2:24:29] hands on somebody has got their hands on
[2:24:31] you remember that quickening power that
[2:24:34] power that raised up Jesus from the
[2:24:36] grave now you have faith in what you got
[2:24:39] in your own body it's going to help that
[2:24:42] person you got your hands on if it
[2:24:45] indwells you it'll also Quicken your
[2:24:48] mortal bodies
[2:24:51] so again you know in the sermon Messiah
[2:24:54] is great sermon if You' never listened
[2:24:56] to it 1961 sort brother Bram said he he
[2:24:59] told of a report of where scientist
[2:25:02] actually took an x-ray where a minister
[2:25:04] was laying hands on the on the sick and
[2:25:06] praying for the sick and it showed by
[2:25:08] x-ray a light transmitting from the one
[2:25:12] praying to the
[2:25:14] sick and then God's provided place of
[2:25:17] worship brother brandom said a 65 sermon
[2:25:20] he said said Grant now that quickening
[2:25:22] power will Quicken their Faith Lord to
[2:25:24] what they're going to going there is
[2:25:26] there is Believers got hands on a
[2:25:28] Believer a body to a body a power to a a
[2:25:32] power and it's the power of God by a Son
[2:25:35] of God or a daughter of God by the Son
[2:25:37] of God oh God May Satan turn this people
[2:25:40] loose may they be healed this afternoon
[2:25:42] by the resurrecting power quickening
[2:25:45] power of the presence identified Christ
[2:25:48] in the name of Jesus Christ may it be so
[2:25:51] you may wonder what does our dirty hands
[2:25:55] have to do with Healing The
[2:26:00] Sick well I'll tell you you know
[2:26:02] preaching is not just expounding the
[2:26:04] word it's demonstrating the
[2:26:08] gospel the Bible said in Corinthians 12
[2:26:11] for one is given by the spirit the word
[2:26:13] of wisdom to another word of knowledge
[2:26:14] to by The Same Spirit another Faith by
[2:26:16] The Same Spirit to another Gifts of
[2:26:18] healing by The Same Spirit to another
[2:26:20] working of Miracles to another prophecy
[2:26:22] to another deserting of spirit to
[2:26:24] another diverse kinds of tongues to
[2:26:26] another interpretation of tongues but
[2:26:28] all these that all these work at that
[2:26:31] one and selfs Same Spirit dividing to
[2:26:34] every man severly as he
[2:26:36] will but what does our dirty hands have
[2:26:40] to do with Healing The
[2:26:42] Sick well you see the work of Jesus was
[2:26:46] to lift the soul of man from The Curse
[2:26:49] of sin
[2:26:51] and to take men who were born in sin
[2:26:55] shape in iniquity and make them by of
[2:26:59] the power of
[2:27:01] creation make them sons of God with
[2:27:06] power and authority against the satanic
[2:27:09] rulers of this world when you pray it
[2:27:14] literally is spiritual warfare
[2:27:20] It cast out Satan's
[2:27:23] kingdom it cast out
[2:27:27] Devils now though the what that
[2:27:31] man but through what was the dirty hands
[2:27:36] of a now transformed man or woman God's
[2:27:41] power can be transferred through those
[2:27:44] hands to someone oppressed by the devil
[2:27:48] and actually cast Satan
[2:27:51] out hands I want you to get this hands
[2:27:54] that once did
[2:27:56] Evil hands that once the devil used
[2:27:59] hands that once held a cigarette or
[2:28:02] alcohol or lifted drugs to the to the
[2:28:06] mouth amen are hands that caressed
[2:28:09] another in fornication those hands oh
[2:28:13] Hallelujah now redeemed can lay hands on
[2:28:17] another and Cas cast Satan out and heal
[2:28:23] The
[2:28:25] Afflicted that's the power of the blood
[2:28:29] brother brandham said in this
[2:28:31] message God's provided place of worship
[2:28:33] 65 sermon your hands on the people has
[2:28:36] got quickening power in
[2:28:39] them stop it just a minute what did he

[2:29:19] Sodom with them hand with them hands of
[2:29:22] these people that that lives that have
[2:29:25] been changed from Street walkers from
[2:29:28] drunkards from prostitutes on the street

[2:29:35] hands are laying on you there in the
[2:29:38] church by Holy Ghost baptism the same

[2:30:15] myself or the sermon and he said you can
[2:30:18] and and you can actually hear them
[2:30:20] people screaming and shouting on the
[2:30:22] recording and he said you believe that's
[2:30:24] his quickening power that's making you
[2:30:26] act crazy to the world and do you
[2:30:28] believe you're in his church then if you
[2:30:30] are believe that those hands that are
[2:30:33] laying on You Are Holy hands commanded
[2:30:35] by God then I command you in the name of
[2:30:38] Jesus Christ to stand your feet and
[2:30:40] accept your

[2:30:43] raised from Death to life and has been
[2:30:46] baptized into the body of the Living God
[2:30:49] that's quick in your body where they is
[2:30:51] speaking in tongues interpreting tongues
[2:30:53] and and seeing Jesus manifest Among Us

[2:31:23] hands the Bible calls you as a Believer
[2:31:26] having holy
[2:31:28] hands them are God's hands to work
[2:31:31] through Jesus can't come and do what he
[2:31:34] did on the shores of Galilee and walk
[2:31:37] down and lay hands on the sick but he
[2:31:39] has your
[2:31:40] hands come on now he has your hands amen
