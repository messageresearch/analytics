word with me saying so glad to see us having a live service today amen well i hope today it'll be alive amen alive with the holy spirit and god moving in our midst amen he's the healer deliverance savior and we thank him for his goodness since we met together we had um we had one of our dear saints that crossed over on the other side that's a sister amelia ingram i know many of you didn't get to go to the service and uh but we had a little graveside service for her with the roncalli family and all the others that gathered and we just want to say that you know with partings sometimes they can be really difficult amen but we know in whom we have believed amen i want you to just play that song what a day that will be when my jesus i shall see as we just think just a moment i just want to take a moment and we want to reflect on sister ingram the lord brought her with us to be with us to sojourn together with us back in the in the 80s and um you know we we had some very wonderful moments together as and with her and our fellowship she was sister phyllis's uh mom and um you know the roncalli family started coming here back in the late 70s and um it wasn't long that their witness brought others and some of them was her her mother and and some of her brothers of course you know back in 1994 we buried one of her sons that was william may and we was just a young man god took him on the other side [Music] and um we also had that so joined with us for a while another son of hers which was ellis ray blake and he's also going on but she's quentin gathered now with her loved ones there and you know when life is over here it's not over it continues on on the other side just one breath away we're in his presence so we want to go to the lord today and we want to thank god for this life let's just bow our heads just a moment [Music] lord we want to thank you today for our sister emilia ingram who walked among us who was precious in your sight lord we remember well her day of deliverance for that you changed her forever we remember what you did how you how you came and lord how the enemy was defeated and victory was wrought and that you brought salvation to that house lord now her old worn tired body has now been laid to rest and she's changed coats now it's a temporary code in a way because it's a theophany that will come one day to pick up the old worn body and glorify it and shall be also changed and we'll be changed with them but lord today i pray that your comfort of the holy spirit will just be ours today as we kind of draw up the belt and step in line and others step in line and realize that we still got a battle to fight and a race to finish and i asked god that you would bless the family lord each one and comfort them in this time and give them that assurance that the loved one that they seen go away will come back again i ask lord your blessings today on this service now that you would anoint it lord with your your presence and that you would speak through us and to us and that you would just reveal your word to us may it be real as we look into the pages of the scripture may you may it be that you opened up our understanding so that we could see the hope of our calling i ask for your anointing today for without it i'm nothing father i could take the scripture and i could read it that's what i can do humanly but father it takes you to take and anoint the word and make it real to our hearts father there are there are those that have needs in their bodies today lord we have prayed the prayer requests for those that have been so sick some of them are still not able to come here today lord i pray that you'll bring healing to them and lord as we have spoke about brother kenneth he's been a sojourner lord in the life's journey we're just not ready for him to get off the train as it were we would like to keep him here in in with us a little longer you've done miracle after miracle i'm asking you'll do another one father we put it in your hands now and in my hands lord today is a couple of prayer requests one for brother rocco rubino who's asked for a prairie prayer cloth another lord for sister tanya that's in south africa they're calling out to you for their needs and their lives and we're sending lord oh god this prayer request knowing that that these prayer costs and with our requests knowing that you have met these needs in times past we've seen you go forth and heal and bring deliverance in the mighty name of jesus we pray that as they're laid upon the sick that evil spirits that is causing sickness in their body will depart and they'll be made well and that they will have the joy and rejoicing of a renewed walk with you we ask it in jesus name bless everyone under the sound of my voice lord those that are listening in lord by the way of internet by the those that will be here in the archives those that are here in our presence lord today i pray that you'll meet every need according to your riches in glory your god who provides it's in jesus name we ask it and we thank you lord amen what a day that will be when my jesus i shall see [Music] me by his grace [Music] a glorious day that will be one more time down shall see and [Music] me by his grace [Music] god bless you turn with me to exodus chapter 3 and we're going to read from verse 1 this morning i'm going to be speaking on revealed by the angel we have been speaking about the angel of the lord and and his great work that he's done in this last day we're going to just look into the scripture today as we see things that are applicable to our age and time exodus chapter 3 verse 1 now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb and the angel of the lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this uh great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the lord saw that he had turned aside to see god called him out of the midst of the bush and moses and said moses moses and he said here am i and he said draw not nigh hitter put off thy shoes from off that feet for the place whereon thou standeth is holy ground moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their task masters for i know their sorrows and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and a large and to a land flowing with milk and honey and to the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel has come unto me and i've also seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt and moses said unto god who am i that i should go unto pharaoh and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of egypt ye shall serve god upon this mountain and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of israel and say unto them the god of your fathers has sent sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name and what shall i say unto them and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus saith thou thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am has sent me unto you and god said moreover unto moses thus shall thou say unto the children of israel the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob has sent me unto you this is my name forever and this is my memorial unto all generations amen may god bless you you can be seated and certainly we ask his blessings upon the word today uh before that we go into the scripture today i thought i would share with you some of you may have already heard this but on sunday february the 14th brother ron spencer had a dream where him and his family were invited to a meeting it was a small building but it was a massive crowd and his family and his wife sister connie the boys were sitting beside him in a row um very near the stage and brother ron was sitting on the edge of the aisle and yet little did they know that brother branham was to be the speaker brother branham was dressed uh in a very beautiful whitish suit he was young and the color of his suit was really hard to describe but it was a shade between ivory and um white and and the garment was unlike anything that he had ever seen it looked incredibly comfortable and you know as he came to the stage brother branham didn't actually preach but he just told a few stories it seemed and it seemed like in the background you could hear the humming from another realm and humming from an unseen dimension was was a song on the wings of a snow white dove right after he finished speaking brother branham walked over to him with a green colored book in his hand and his title was the way of a true prophet it was one of those original um spoken word books and it was um this sermon that his dad brother charlie spencer had listened to when he first came to know brother branham was a prophet and it was a sermon played in in the spencer home many times and brother branham asked brother ron would you like to have this book and he held it out for him to take and and as he did he looked into brother branham's eyes and said brother branham i have believed this message all of my life and i preached it all over the world and i tried my best brother branham and and he looked at him and said ronald and he patted him on the cheek like that and said you're going to be well and then they walked out of the building and brother branham asked him would you like to have your picture taken with me and he said i sure would brother branham i'd love to have my picture taken with you so he stood right beside him and the boys and connie were there and brother branham standing beside him and he just reached over and patted brother ron on the shoulder and he said homer and that's his father-in-law who's already went on to be with the lord he said he will be here in just a few more moments amen i'll tell you you know i think that is very very fitting um you know as they as he listened in that dream to the humming from another realm of a unseen dimension on the wings of a snow white dove i can remember the year was 1965 i was 11 years old i sat on my edge of my seat in rapt attention there in shreveport louisiana as brother branham preached that sermon on the wings of a snow white dove and when he when he got to the end that my young heart almost burst as he as he began to tell of a verse that he had written to that song and i thought it was very very fitting to go with the dream though i have suffered in many a way i've cried for healing both night and day but faith wasn't forgotten by the father above he sent down his sign on the wings of a dove and just this week you know um brother ron as brother timothy said had a battery of tests later he would get a call from the cancer clinic and the doctor said you know i've saved the miracle call today for the my last call today he said no new cancer the spots in the kidney that we thought was cancer whatever that is is all gone and um and so you know we we they just told him to keep the course and continue on and of course in a couple more months they'll have another brain scan and we're expecting them to all be gone amen and we believe the word of god now we believe his promise and we're thankful even for the visitations of the lord when he comes and just drops a little something in us to help us along the journey amen now as we have read the scripture today the we read about a pillar of fire or fire in a bush that not did not burn it was called there a flame of fire and it appeared to moses there and and moses after the discourse that he had with him that he he asked the question you know when they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them and god said to moses i am that i am and he said thou shall say the children of israel i am has sent me unto you this is a wonderful name of god and it's represented in the text as a a tetragrammaton the tetragrammaton is a greek word for four letters it is in in the hebrew writing it is um the best we can translate it into english because um letters differ slightly from our alphabet that um it is it is y-h-y-h-w-h and so it's a four consonants of the ancient hebrew name for god is also translated again as as j h v h because the hebrews and english letters don't match exactly but um strangely enough the exact pronunciation pronunciation of yh wa is not now known it it occurs in various written and spoken forms some will pronounce it as yahweh or jehovah and about vocalizing these four letters the jews say as an expression of infinite greatness and majesty of god it was held to be unpronounceable and hence was replaced during the reading of the sacred scripture by the means of the use of the altered name adonai which means um lord so in other words they wouldn't say this name they got where they wouldn't say this name and they would just put in for that name the name the name lord now you see it was on account of the original uh understanding of the third commandment they had changed that that began to say that said you shall not take the name of the lord your god in vain so you see and of course that meant that we was to keep our vows when swearing by god's name but but israel's anxious sages and their rabbis that begin to reinterpret this to mean even using the lord's name lightly or frivolously and to avoid the risk of employing the divine name irreverently the sages ruled that one should not uttered at all and eventually the only time this name could be said was in the temple and then eventually only the priests were allowed to say that sacred name and then when the temple was destroyed and the jews were taken captive down to babylon the exact pronunciation of the letters were lost because it's all consonants it has no vowels to it and so you know they lost even how to say the sacred name of god and again you know um this was because the jewish sages misinterpreted the third commandment so the pronunciation of the name was lost and soon nobody knew how to say this but i want to just declare we know the name of the i am god and his name is jesus and that name rebukes sickness it heals diseases it casts out devils it saves sinners and that name contains the essence of the i am that i am because he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now why is it important to know the name of god is jesus you see the name of jesus is god's representative of judgment that christ has already judged for your sins and sickness and your temptations so when you when you pray in the name of jesus and you speak that name you are speaking of god's representation where your price of redemption was paid for your healing was paid for your sickness was paid for your sins were paid for and that christ all was judged for your temptation and for your sickness but i want to declare to you that jesus is the i am this one that we're reading about that appeared in the burning bush of fire who said i his name was i am that i am to tell them i am has sent you that that jesus is that great i am if you look with me in john chapter 8 and verse 24 he said i said unto you that you will die in your sins for if you believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins now that pronoun he if you're looking at the king james version it was added by the kjv translators to make the reading more understandable but the original text says if you believe not that i am amen you will die in your sins now you again this is going to be very applicable to our last day because we must believe in the i am god not the i was not the i will be though he was and he will be but he is he is today the i am and every day wherever day you come to he is the i am god he's never known as i was or that i will he will always be there i am jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever revelation 1 17 and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death so three times in the book of revelation he has declared himself as the i am amen he's a he is i am that liveth he is uh i am the person to last and he says i am alive forevermore and these are very key to what god has done in this day and hour in order to show himself alive with infallible proofs of his resurrection i'd like to share with you a quotation from israel in the church brother branham says i have come down to deliver them i am delivered declaring my name tell them that will be a memorial through all generations that i am the i am not that i was or that i will be i am the same god that was there that night is here tonight and i'm to now i'm going before you i'm going to send my angel and he's going to be in a pillar of fire and i'm going to send him before you now as a pillar of fire and he will lead you a pillar of fire so big like a pillar a pillar of fire shall go before you to lead you i am will be in that pillar of fire now in the paradox message he said when jesus on the earth he said i come from god and i go to god and we know that he was the i am and the i am was that logos that pillar of fire and that when he went back to god and ascended upon high saw of tarsus was on his road down to damascus one day and that same light fell in before him and blinded him so now we know then that that hear the i am god showing himself in the pillar of fire and and he will he would declare himself i am jesus there is no difference if i can say it that way no difference between the i am god and jesus jesus is the i am now brother branham was asked in in question answer 64 has the name of the lord changed in different dispensations and he said yes he was he was once called he was called the i am he's called jehovah he's changed many times the last time it was changed was when god became flesh and took a human name and jehovah the i am and all those titles are the titles to a name and if he was baptized in the name of jehovah it would have to be in the name of jesus christ if you were baptized in the name of jehovah rapha or jehovah manassas or jehovah jiren or all of those it would have to be jesus christ that i am is jesus christ remember standing there that day you say the he said you say you ate man in the wilderness and our fathers ate man in the wilderness he said they're dead said and and and he would stand on that there and let me just go on in that scripture he said before abraham was i am and he said we all know you're crazy because you're just a man and not over 50 years old and you say you seen abraham and he said before abraham was i am and he said he was the i am and all the titles that ever belong to god was made one human name the lord jesus christ think of that all the titles that ever belong to god whether you think of elohim melchizedek el shaddai or or jehovah and all the different um attributes of jehovah jehovah shalom jehovah zarah jehovah and manasseh or whatever or jehovah whatever it is all of those titles belong to god now so you again and that not only belonged to god but they belong to jesus christ amen because god all the names that ever belonged to god was made one human name the lord jesus christ and the anointed ones at the end time he would say we see plainly after the seven seals have been opened that's to reveal that mystery now remember those seals were revealed by the lamb as the seventh angel uh seven angel ministering spirits of god brought the revelation and the way revelation is supposed to come revelation is to come through a prophet amen now then he says but what is the trinity see where was it ever called the trinity where in the bible does it even speak the word trinity of course we know it doesn't right and then there's not a place in the bible it speaks of a trinity or even even refers to the the word trinity but he said where could there be three gods that we worship three gods and not be heathen amen because hero is the lord thy god is one lord amen how can they be separate and when he said i my father are one except you believe that i am he you will die in your sins your unbe your unbelief sin is unbelief you'll perish in your unbelief oh who now he goes into a song now that's that's uh that he he's gonna bring right in here with what he believes he says oh who do you say that i am from whence did you say that i came oh do you know my father or can you tell his name i am the roses sharon the bride and the morning star can you tell me who he is i am that spoke to moses in the burning bush of fire i am the god of abraham the bride and morning star i am the rose of sharon oh whence did you say that i came oh do you know my father or can you tell his name amen i am alpha and omega the beginning in the end i am the whole creation and jesus is his name hallelujah amen now so of course we we have spoke about being in a day that we are living in with this is as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the days of the coming or the revealing of the son of man so again what were those those were lights from heaven as as angels would come down and take on flesh god himself would wrap himself in a as the pillar of fire would hover over 17 elements or whatever they are that makes up a human body don't make to me no no difference to me how many they are i'm not a scientist we're just we're just actually referring to some things that brother branham said about that but they were lights from heaven they come down and here he takes an on a body he wraps himself in flesh and comes down in an investigating judgment now remember we've been through it he is looking for faith because when the son of man cometh will he find faith he's got to have somebody that will believe and he'll do whatever it takes to turn your heart from unbelief to faith because this is a god who is determined to fulfill his word i mean he's with me now and the other things he's looking for those he will seal those who sigh and cry for the abominations that's done in the city that sin makes them sick which is an evidence of the holy ghost in a person's life is that right yes sir now let me just assure you that same angel that was there that stayed with abraham discerned the hearts of sarah in the tent and began to tell him of the secrets of what was going to happen down in sodom and the the end time events and the promise of the coming son and all these other things that are in type notice that that same angel there will be is the one who is representing himself today christ himself vindicating himself in a message in this last day amen again to return our hearts back to the faith the original doctrine that was once delivered to the saints now the truth it will return us back to miracles signs wonders healings deliverance gifts everything that's in the bible but but in particular it's going to turn us back to the original teaching that paul preached the original gospel are you with me now now let me just assure you today that angel is not dead amen angels can't die amen they're immortal beings they're free from death they cannot die amen now so you you see uh and brother branham would say these words he says now do you believe angels can't die they can't die their immortal beings are free from death they cannot die then when that angels that stood with paul is still in existence today of this the one that was in the burning bush is still in existence today and we're even going to show you that the pillar of fire amen the one that was in that pillar of fire was there in jesus name when he walked the shores of galilee amen now he would come on and take on the name jesus which would combine every previous name of god before him it would all be incorporated or encapsulated in that one name because there would be no salvation in any other name his only name there's deliverance it's only named as healing there's only a name there's salvation is in that name jesus the angel said call his name jesus he was named actually by the angel heaven named him and that name means jehovah the savior for he will save his people from their sins now so again as he as brother branham would talk about this and we know the angel lord that accompanied his minister and that that there was a pillar of fire that would come service after service after service which was the angel lord in the in the form of a pillar of fire then he he said that's this the god that met paul on the road down to damascus and shown around him like a big light that same lord jesus is alive and risen tonight there was a light that is that shone around is that right of light perhaps maybe the same light that the children of israel followed through the wilderness a fire a light a pillar of fire that led them in the darkness i believe he's here tonight i believe he's the same yesterday today and forever now you can say you can believe that brother branham now watch this and he says that would be a theology now theology is also known as a theory so you can say well i believe that well that's only a theory that's only a theology that's that's a creed creed means i believe this is what i believe but he said if god confirms that to be the truth then it's no longer a theology it's the truth it becomes a reality now i want to get to it to you i mean anybody can say i saw a light i saw a pillar of fire i saw this it moved here it did that it stood over this and it did that it was here it's leading me hey you know it said this and that but when it discerned the thoughts and the intentions of heart when it tells the name and the address and where they come from when it never failed then you know it's got to be the original logos because the logos the word discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart amen now this angel is the angel of the covenant it's none other than the lord jesus christ and we're we're talking about listen we are a book of acts church amen we we're we're the logos is speaking and manifests himself to people in this generation you are a people who have heard directly from the logos no that's not a theology am i not not something hatched out in the seminary not a message of of just a messenger but i want to get it it was a message from the god himself through the angel of the covenant this is no mere man's ideas it's no mere man's uh the doctrines are thinking it is the voice of almighty god to the last age and you've got to have an ear to hear it you must hear what the spirit is saying to the church because this is a day specifically what the spirit speaks and vindicates who is speaking and he wants you to know it's not the eyeballs or the i will be but it's the i am still speaking now you can tell if it's the same angel lord because you watch its nature it bears the same fruit it's here in the church bearing the same fruit making another pentecostal church this is what brother branham said now what's the angel lord what's what kind of nature it has it bears the same fruit that it did when it was here on the earth now it's back in the church it is bearing forth the same fruit making another pentecostal church just exactly the way it did the first time now i'm going to tell you if whatever you're following doesn't make another book of acts original pentecostal church exactly like the original church of pentecost it is not the angel of the lord because you can identify if it changes the lord by the fruit that it produces now again again let us just declare to you who is the messenger of this hour and we know we have earthly messengers we know when and we certainly believe that you know the seventh angel was william branham we believe that he had in accordance to the bible that in the days the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god would be finished we believe that we're here in the seventh church age and that he would address that god jesus would address letters to men who are messengers so he would say to the angels angelos which is the same word with john the baptist says when he spoke of john the baptist as a messenger i'll sin before my face is angelos he was a messenger or an angel from god are you with me amen but he was earthly angel but i want you to understand though the earthly angel is no longer here the angel lord is still here and he's still in charge he has not left his church we would see jesus he would he said it this way and jesus said as it was and there's a lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man there the church nominal has their messengers and the messenger of the holy spirit is with the church elected doing the same thing which makes him christ the same yesterday today and forever who is the messenger of this hour no man the holy ghost is the messenger of this hour what is it god dwelling in human flesh glory i feel religious god in human flesh dwelling among you jesus said lo a little while the world saith me more no more that's the unbeliever but you shall see me the church for i personal pronoun again i'll be with you even in you to the end of the age the end of the world jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever our god is not dead he's living forever more he's living at the end time when the sun is setting amen want to just bring it back to you we have not just heard from a mere man we have heard from the messenger of the covenant the holy ghost himself amen and that is the messenger of the hour so the angel is still here as brother branham say that same angel that led israel is here now performing and doing the same thing it did when it was in the person of jesus christ christ the body is ascended to the right hand of the father but the holy spirit has come back the life that was in christ is in the church john 14 uh john 15 i'm divine you are the branches of vine doesn't bear fruit it's the branch and you know you people here your great razors and so on if that first branch that came out of the vine produced a book of acts behind it that first church if that vine ever puts forth another another branch it'll write another book of acts behind it for the very light that's in the vine brings forth into the branch now now i want to come down to some things today as we as we speak because along with the miracles of jesus were the teachings of jesus and in abraham's day there was the miracle the change there was the miracle of the discernment there was a miracle of saving lot out of sodom there were miracles that were taking place are you with me and when the calling of sarah's name that had been given her by the angel but but i want you to notice it was not all miracles it was the revealing to abraham the hidden things notice now and then that day he didn't didn't and when we come to this day he didn't just discern the heart and and heal the sick and open the eyes of the blind and cripples walk come on but he but he then these things never failed and never missed but he is also here revealing himself to abraham's group the mysteries so you see jesus had miracles that proved he was from god come on but also what did he have he had a message the teachings of jesus moses had miracles with signs but he didn't just have miracles he had the teachings of moses we come right down to abraham abraham received they received miracles but then there was the teachings given to abraham from the angel i want you to get this this is revealed by the angel wasn't things that moses knew wasn't things abraham knew and i'll tell you in a minute it wasn't even things jesus knew it was the things that the logos knew now the logos the word the bible said in hebrews 4 12 for the word the logos of god is alive if it was live then his life now and it's powerful and it's sharper than any two-edged sword it pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit and the joints in the moral and is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart now you see that's why brother branham would say and and and advise us you know because these things didn't just come from william branham and he would say to us don't you see friends don't let loose of that word you see it's a spirit that gets on you and i tell these women when they make themselves look sexy in these dresses that god's going to make you answer for committing adultery if you believe me to be what i s what what you say god's servant a prophet listen to what i'm telling you you might not be able to understand it and if you can't then just do what i tell you to do god will hold me responsible for what i said you listen real close and remember those things are spirit so a lot of things that he would address he wasn't just addressing uh the situation he was looking at the spirit behind it you can say well i don't understand why that was said well sometimes you don't understand because you're not seeing the motivating force that is causing that to happen amen now so he had said to abraham he said shall i hide from abraham what i'm going to do so you know here he discerns his heart and now he begins to reveal the mysteries he tells about the end time judgment the burning of sodom the salvation of those that are down in sodom all these mysteries the mystery of the coming sun the mystery of the body change the mystery if we can bring it down it's the mystery of the rapture amen it tells all of these things notice it doesn't go down to sodom it doesn't go to lox group it goes to abraham and history beholden but there's somebody going to believe it thank you lord now so he would say i'm not going to keep from abraham the secrets that i know because he's going to be the heir of the the world and he says we got to write this morning to know the secrets of the coming of the lord for blessed are the peacemakers they shall be called the children of god blessed are they that hunger and thirst they shall be filled blessed are the pure heart for they shall see god blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth then if the it's if the church of the living god has inherited the earth there is no secret to be kept from it so this is why that here we come down to the last age that god is bringing a time of restoration and it's going to be a restoration by the angel of the covenant himself now i want you to look back and think for a moment at israel's deliverance from down in egypt god spoke to moses in a burning bush of fire it was a pillar of fire it was the angel lord but who was that angel lord now whoever he was that's who he is today [Music] because that was only a prophecy speaking of the end time it's not just a story that's right not just a jewish history it's a prophecy amen now as brother branham would declare about it and you don't remember him saying this in 20th century prophet he said to my opinion it's the same angel of god that followed the children of israel from egypt to palestine you know as a scholar yourself that was the angel of covenant none other than our lord jesus christ now that same mighty cabinet angel has presented to you an open book it is the title to our inheritance if you're looking in revelation you know the book of revelation there's a book sealed with seven seals is that right but for you it's not a sealed book it's an open book amen because the mighty angel has presented to you an open book by removing the seals now he's the same one that founded the nation of the seed of abraham it was angel lord who would also call the church out in the first exodus and would appear in the burning boots of fire listen brother branham in the book of exodus he says the pillar of fire that led the children of israel through the day and night in the daytime it looked like a cloud at night time it looked like a pillar of fire leading to israel and that was the angel of the covenant none other than jesus christ himself before he was made flesh and come in the womb of mary it was christ moses followed christ christ said the scripture said he was in the wilderness with moses and that's who he was the angel of the covenant now again in redemption by power he says it this way god gave them a pillar of fire to go before them i think they had the picture here tonight i'd say it with reverence to my honest opinion while we're here in this group tonight i believe that is with us that that same pillar of fire that led to children of israel is going before us performing the same signs and wonders and any teacher or scholar of the bible knows that that angel followed israel and guided them to the promised land it was the angel of the covenant which was jesus christ and today jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever is following before this group that you want to call holy rollers if you want to all right going on leading them from victory on the victory now i want you to understand he's going to take this church where all the way into rapture he's not going to abandon the project he's not going to turn his back on us he's not going to leave us and abandon us he's going to be with us even in us to the end of the world this is his promise i will never leave you so the same pillar of fire is right here in the church as we gather today the same logos the same word of god the same one who created the world no wonder then he can create new eyes no wonder he can create new hair no wonder he can heal cancer no wonder he can do this because he's the creator himself now let's give you some scripture i want you to go to first corinthians 10 4. that rock in the wilderness let's see who he was and they all did drink the same spiritual drink for the drink of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ so here he goes to show you that the one they followed was christ now go go with me to hebrews chapter 11 26 moses esteemed the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures of in egypt perhaps respected to the recompense of reward so it was the reproach of christ that he esteemed greater than the treasures of egypt in first peter 1 11 search and water what minor of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify so it was the spirit of christ leading them in the wilderness when it testified before time uh beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory that should follow so again this would be david under the song my god my god why has i forsaken me my bones they spared me only it was the spirit of christ in david is that right now that it's showing us that he's the same jesus now not the jesus of the seminaries not a denominational jesus but the jesus you you see that jesus of denomination and seminaries is a jesus that is handcrafted molded and formed by went to whatever image they want to make them amen someone to make him the second person of a trinity someone to take and make him mind his mama you better pray to her first come on because he gotta mind his mama he can't turn his mama's heart down whatever mama says that's the catholic church that's right right amen denominations want to hand craft him and change him and mold him into whatever they want they want a jesus that you know is all accepting of all kinds of sin now listen he's accepted of all kinds of sinners but not all kinds of sin [Applause] are you with me amen he will accept anyone who wants to come and repent you're a homosexual a lesbian if you're a murderer rapist or whatever you can come to him and find mercy but he won't leave you in your sins he will save you from your sins amen now you see again he is not the jesus of the seminaries he is not the jesus of denominations this that jesus is found in in thessalonians where he sits in the temple of god showing himself that he is god and when the mask is taken off of him he's not really jesus at all it's the devil it's the man of sin now you see this was the same covenant angel that led joshua into the promised land and it's the same covenant angel that's leading us into the full promise of the word just like joshua was prophesying by what he was doing you see they didn't realize it but their lives were prophesied they were foretelling that there was going to be things that would happen in the end time where a people would be brought in to a land of promise even as israel was restored a man but as a nation back to their back to their homeland even so god's doing the same thing with a spiritual people a spiritual israelis they restore them back to their homeland and that homeland is the bible amen we we we can't find a home in baptist methodist presbyterian catholic but we can find a homeland right here in this bible right here in this word of god [Applause] now so you see it's that covenant angel leading us into the full promise of the word as he led joshua into the promised land and you remember you remember that day as they were as he was looking at the walls now remember there were seals there were sealed walls that had to be opened in order to come into the promised land jericho will have to be the first conquest if we don't get the sealed walls down come on amen then we can't have the rest of the land but when you get jericho open then all the rest of the land is open amen so we start right here seven seals has got to be revealed amen until the book is open and the seals are taken off then we can inherit all the land but if we get the seals open then the rest of the land is out every promise that lays in the book is ours healing is ours deliverance is our salvation is ours the rapture is our everything that lays in the promised land but first the seals have to be broken hallelujah remember they went around there seven times in silence and nobody knew the mystery nobody understood but when they come to the seventh time there was a memorial again of the seven times that they went as we and we went back and we said do we come through one church age second church age three or third church age four churches fifth churches six churches seventh church age amen because the last day you march around it seven times amen and it all becomes revealed and we hear it we are reminded of our journey amen but once that we complete that it's time now for the shout out for the silence to be broken do you understand we're in the day where god himself breaks the silence word that has been held back mysteries that have been held back to the end times and god breaks the silence with a shout out amen when he shouts the walls come down hallelujah are you with me now so this joshua seen this man as he goes to conqueror he needs a battle plan he needs to know how do i get in this and so joshua's seen this man it was the captain in other words the leader of the host of israel you know in joshua 5 13 the bible said joshua looked and there stood a man with a sword drawn in his hand and joshua went to him and said our thou forests are for our adversaries and he says nay basically he says i'm not on your side you're on my side amen amen because as captain of the host of the lord i am now i'm sure you got this all wrong you think i you know i'm going to help you with it no this is not your battle this is my back amen and i am here to lead you in this battle i am going before you i'm not i'm not abandoning you i'm not somewhere far away i'm not hanging back in the background i am here right here going before you amen amen as captain of the army of the lord am i come i am taking charge and i'm leading the way hallelujah i'm preaching to a people today that are lit by a pillar of fire and man he goes before you and man you can look at any enemy you can look at any situation and you know your god is already wet before you be comforted he'll comfort for you today amen that leader brother brandon said was none other than christ himself what was he seeing in a pillar of fire and now that pillar of fire had become a man hope you know what i'm talking about he become a man joshua alone by himself seen just what it was that that pillar of fire that led them as an angel here he stood and he called himself the captain of the host he was the unseen one and he's still the captain of the host of the lord the unseen one the invisible one the omnipotent one and he stands tonight just as really was standing there against the walls of jericho the same lord jesus that made abraham many many hundred years before there had no father no mother no beginning of days or end of years melchizedek the eternal one now let me remind you this pillar of fire this jesus this holy spirit of the bible is not giving us a theory or a theology but a word by divine vindication now in in the book of revelation it begins with you know blessed is he that readeth and they say here's the word of this prophecy keep those things that are written for the time is at hand we're here this is where the time is at hand when when when the revelation of jesus christ has been revealed to the body of christ and christ has been revealed as not dead but alive a man living in his church doing the same things he did the same ministry the same gospel the same sign the same resurrected christ when he's revealed by his angel in church then the time is at hand so we are here in the hour where the time is at hand never been a time until that day until this has the mystery of jesus christ been revealed until these last few years that's why we know the time is at hand now it has to compare with the rest of the scripture but it does not have to compare with men's interpretation of the rest of the scripture it has to be biblical but it does not have to fit men's interpretations of the bible now let's talk about this in the old testament they had the breastplate of aaron they called it the human thurman and when one would prophesy and tell his dream it would have to be told before this year of thurman if it was true that god would answer by the pillar of fire and it would shine through those 12 stones of israel on the breastplate of aaron the the the the urim and thurman and so then every he would manifest himself through lights to prove whether whatever the prophesier was saying was of god or not it had to be vindicated by a pillar of fire amen now we got a lot of people with a lot of claims but i want to know does the light shine is there pillow fire to vindicate it from genesis to revelation come on you know people can say a lot of things they can have a lot of opinions and they can say this and this and this national and and and have their discourses and their theologies and what they believe but does the pillar of fire vindicate it so what we're looking for for it to be the truth is for the prophet's prophecy to flash by the light [Applause] now you say well i'm a teacher and i believe something different we we we've got our ideas and we we've got well death where is the light that vindicates you're from god all right now when a prophet prophesies or a preacher preaches or an evangelist preaches or the dream said or whatever it is if it isn't according to word it's wrong and he says this is now god's your concern is that right if he doesn't declare if he doesn't um and if that angel who has declared himself and has proven if he doesn't in the human flesh declare himself to be the same nature with the same spirit working the same signs that he did when he was on the earth then it's the wrong angel so what were we looking for one that could discern the thoughts and intents of heart whose prophecies never fail come on amen and and what is it it would have to be have the same nature to be the same angel and it's not it's the wrong angel and if he declares himself to be the same it's christ and the church manifests himself in these last days he says that's as clear as i know the word now i wanted to say to you this was not an angel that came in a secret closet that nobody else saw because even those who didn't see it they were witnesses there were those who saw the pillar of fire there were souls who saw even the the physical form of the angel of the lord that stepped out of that pillar of fire and my but you know again even those who didn't see it like myself you know i didn't see it but i saw the effects of his presence i don't see the wind but i know if the wind is blowing i can feel the effects i can see the effects [Applause] hey man when he calls out a lady that i went to church with and as a young kid you know how children do six seven years old you know i'd get tired and i'd lay down on her lap sometime and go to sleep in the church her name and and she her name was sister boyd and he would call her out by name and tell her you got bursitis in your arm listen let me tell you something friends i knew i knew he didn't know that woman she testified he didn't know her she was my friend a close friend of my family and him to be called her by name and tell her her situation i didn't see the angel but i saw the events now i knew the angel was there now this is no mormon angel who delivers gold plates with coded unbiblical teachings this is the angel lord and he's the same one who taught paul by revelation now the true revelation is always brought by an angel amen i want that to sink in true has to be brought by an angel abraham received the revelation of one god did you know that he was a he was a his father was an idol maker an idol worshiper but the angel taught him about the founding of a new and godly race to which the messiah would come for through him all nations would be the world would be blessed and he catches a revelation god is one god and it leads him out of his heathen home and takes him down into a into a new place into a new land he had to get where the messiah was going to come now the angel of the covenant would appear to moses with a message of deliverance but also he instituted or should i say reinstituted the blood sacrifice said you gave them a token of the blood come on and then on mount sinai the angel of the covenant in a pillar of fire came down on the mountain and delivered the word of god in the form of the law now where do you think we got genesis from hello somebody what do you think you got the the the first five books of the bible where do you think you got it you think that was just the mind of moses now moses was a skilled man sure he was trained up with the egyptians but moses would write the first five books of the bible and where do you think it came down from where do you think he got that from amen where do you think the account of the creation came from and my genesis is called the first book of moses and he would write down what he saw by vision from that pillar of fire i want to say to you your bible came from the pillar of fire it did not come from a seminary it did not come from a denomination it came from the pillar of fire the logos the world amen now moses by revelation would bring us the view of the creation now that's an angel's view that's right that was brought to him by vision he would say in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth that counters all the smart men of the world today that claim to be smart moses by revelation would bring bring the angel's view of of the creation in fact of the matter is the book of acts declares in acts 7 53 we receive the law by the dispensation of or disposition of angels or the administration of angels in galatians 3 19 he says it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator that is the law was given by angels through moses who stood between god and man and in hebrews chapter 2 and verse 1 it says we ought to give more earnest heed to the things that we have heard that's what i'm trying to do for you today give more earnest key listen this is not just a man's message this is god's message this is not just man's ideas it's god's word are you with me amen we ought to give more earnest heed to the things we have heard lest any time we should let them slip that means to leak out like a leaking vessel you know just lose it a little bit at a time for if the words spoken by angels were steadfast and the other transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of rewards you see you see that's what the law was the word spoken by angels the messenger of the covenant how shall we escape if we neglect so great of salvation which at first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard it god also bearing them witness but with signs and wonders and divers miracles and gifts of the holy spirit according to his will he said how are you going to escape if they didn't escape if they perished because they didn't believe their prophet what are you going to do when the if the word spoken by angels was steadfast what about it when we have received from the lord himself amos 3 and 7 it tells us surely god the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secrets unto his servants the prophets so he's very clear how his secret is going to come it will have to come from a prophet now but some will protest but brother tim that's not the that's not the way god reveals his word today for god has now spoke through his son well i'm glad you brought that up let's go to hebrews 1 and 1. let's read this god who had sundried times and divers manners spake in the times past unto the fathers by the prophets so he the hebrew writer would say you know this is the way god spoke in times past but he hath in these last days because he's walked now three and a half years on the earth spoken unto us by his son whom he has appointed heir of all things by whom he has also made the worlds who be in the brightness of his glory and express the image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins he sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high so and and i i want to just say now then but who was the son if it were not the father the creator of the fleshly body of jesus the logos made flesh are you with me now you see he has he had spoke to us by his son because god did not come visible in jesus christ but i want you to understand that god is still speaking through christ but no longer through the fleshly body of christ jesus he sits there on the air on the throne but his spirit is still here in the church now so who was the son if it were not the father the creator of that fleshly body the lugos made flesh now of course we know jesus couldn't be his own father he could not he could not the body could not create itself the spirit created that body amen but it don't ever say anywhere that the father couldn't be his own son because this is what god did he made a body and came and dwelt in it and he wasn't a different person he was the same person but now dwelling in the human body now again in the laodicean church age now to show that he's the first he's also the beginning of the creation of god let's just very let's go to our revelation of the godhead in revelation 3 14. this is for our age to the angel of the church of the laodiceans right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god now that is the revelation that we are to stand upon in this last age it's a revelation of deity to the lay of the sin to the angel messenger of laodicean's right i want you to know this these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god now first of all god was going to put an amen to everything he said when come on when brother branham would stand there after preaching he said now if i told the truth let him vindicate it what was god doing give him an amen it is my word is that right and then these things sayeth the amen he's a faithful and true witness it never misses somebody help me preach the beginning of the creation of god now let's look at let's look at this he's standing in the midst of church he's revealing who he is in the last age he calls himself the author of the creation of god this is another creation this has to do with the church it's a special designation of himself he is the creator of the church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as the spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the womb the cells from which his body was born in the womb of the virgin mary the cells from which his body had been was born i want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of mary for that body it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to humanovin supplied by mary that would have been sinful mankind producing a body that would not have produced the last adam of him it was said lo a body has thou father prepared for me god not mary provided that body mary was the human incubator amen she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a god man he was the son of god he was of the new creation and man and god met and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race colossians 1 18 he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence first corinthians 15 21 for for since by man king death by man came also the resurrection of the dead for as in adam all die so in christ shall all men be made alive is that right so he's the first one from the dead amen amen because of all adam died come on but but and all who is in adam died but all that are in christ shall be made alive he's the firstborn from the dead he is the head of a new race he is the new creation what did god do he took cursed earth that had been formed now around that light that he placed in mary and there she ate and took up the elements of the earth and a body was built and that body there was brought right down to the river jordan and there is the river jordan somebody with me now here at the river jordan god and man met together again we had been alienated from god since adam but now god and man became reconciled in jesus christ amen and the only way you can be reconciled back to god is to be born of jesus christ of that same race hallelujah amen now ii corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creation all things have passed away behold all things have become new that you can see that man was of the old order of creation but now united with christ he becomes a new creation of god ephesians 2 10 for we are of his workmanship created in christ jesus under good works ephesians 4 24 that you put on the new man which after clock god is created in righteousness and true holiness you see a christian is is not an old man made over again come on he's not a reformed sinner he is a new creation he is a brand new species he is a species that the devil has no control over that we can see the thing that that satan has come and he has no part in me because i'm not a part of the old creation i'm a part of the new creation i am a new species in christ jesus hallelujah that's who jesus was the devil had no claim on him and when god filled you with the holy ghost he claims this soil you lived in hallelujah he claims it for the resurrection to be changed also in a moment in the twinkling of an eye [Music] now so he is the author of this new creation notice how could god be created if he's a spirit so you see it's not jesus is the creation of god in the sense that god created god but god created a body therefore the father had a son the eternal spirit had an offspring that he made in the womb of a woman and then he comes and dwells in it amen not not two gods not two lords not a not a major god and a minor god not one that's god and the other isn't god it's all god amen but he was the beginning of that new creation it was which is jesus christ was made manifest god lived in he is god's creation my the first and last the amen the beginning of the creation of god when god created himself a body he came down and lived there that's the beginning of the creation of god and and he said oh isn't that wonderful now we find at the first i'm an alpha and omega this is what he says in the first the first of the book of revelation i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending says the lord which was which is which was and which is to come the almighty that's revelation 1 8. now so he shows his deity right here in the scripture he says i am the almighty amen i am he that was which is and shall come the almighty and he says this three times in the very right there in the first part of the book of revelation to make sure we get it that he's not a minor god he's not a secondary god he's not just a prophet he is god now to the church of ephesus then it comes down to the laodiceans and he said i'm the amen so i'm the first and the last i'm the amen i am the beginning of the creation of god to the church ages you'll have to learn that i am god god created in a man form i am the beginning of the creation of god and he said that would make a presbyterian chapter amen just think about it beginning of the creation god i like that the creation of god when god was created when god was made flesh in jesus christ and dwelt among us now this is why when we come to the new testament account of genesis now here again it's a man moved by the spirit here is john he's above a disciple john 1 1. and he goes back and he gives us the new testament genesis and he says in the beginning was the lugos the word and the word was with god and the logos was god oh my and the same was in the beginning with god and by him all things were made by him so whoever this is is the creator because he made all things and without him was not anything made that was made is that right and in him was life hello eternal life but i want to go beyond that just a moment the arabic says it this way in him was lies plural because you were in him in him in the logos in the word in the thought of god that became flesh come on in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and in him was lies you can't help but come in the manifestation you cannot stay lost hallelujah because in him was your life you were in him before the world began you were in him you're more than a time being you are an eternal being oh the revelation could just strike your heart amen you have come from god you became human and you're leaving this human life to become god again immortal eternal with him and verse 14 says and the word the logos was made flesh and dwelt among us you see the logos made flesh in jesus christ and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so even then it was the logos revealing the word the angel of the covenant was in jesus christ if you notice the whole time that jesus is here pillar of fire is not mentioned is that right amen but that because the pillar of fire came and dwelt we can go down to the river jordan just for a moment it came down like a dove not wasn't a dove it came down like a dove it was a fluttering whirling fire and it comes down like a dove and it evokes upon jesus christ and dwells in him amen john was told that it would come and it would abide abode on him jesus said when you get it it will abide with you forever in other words it won't come and go you want backslide and sin and do this and that and grieve it away no sir once the holy ghost comes he abides with you forever you are sealed to the day of your redemption he never leads you or forsakes you now john 14 10 jesus will make it clear that what he is preaching is not his own thoughts human thoughts watch it what's here he would tell you first who's living in him john 14 10 believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father in me and the words that i speak to you i speak not of myself this is not human ability now i'm trying to get your mind away from your own human abilities well i think uh-uh we got to be thinking what god said well the theologian ah we got to be saying what god said god speaks he's got a word watch this jesus said the words that i speak to you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works so who where was the father the the pillar of fire the one who had made a body had come and dwelt in the body and it was not the body's own thought it was not human reason it wasn't something taught by mary it wasn't something he'd learned by rabbis it wasn't something he had learned in school this had come from the father what's now he doeth the works he dwelleth in me verse 7 of chapter 7 verse 16 of john jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but kings that sent me amen now who were who who was it that sent him the one who sent him came in is that right he dwelt in him and he said it didn't come from me it come from this one dwelling in me amen it comes from my father the one who created this body john 8 28 then jesus said unto them when you have lifted up the son of man then you shall know that i am that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but as my father had taught me i speak these things so in order to get this notice now the message of jesus did not come from a seminary it did not come from halls of learning it came from god himself revealing the gospel or the good news of jesus christ now you know again you know people will say okay brother tim we got that that you know that was god now speaking in his son he spoke to us in these last days so god only speaks now through his son brother tim after after jesus there are no more prophets well that's not what paul said he taught in ephesians 4 when jesus ascended up into heaven he sent back gifts to the church apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors and he continued building up the church until upon the foundation that jesus himself gave because jesus christ would be the chief cornerstone is that right but paul now was one who had a right paul had a right to pride himself as a learned man but the new testament that he wrote didn't come from that school it came from the pillar of fire it was that light that met him on the road to damascus who identified himself as the one who dwelt in jesus christ he would strike him down on the road damascus with a bright light a pillar of fire come on and there he would fall down in the dust of the of the of the uh on the road and he would say who art thou lord because he knew that light was the lord whoever he was and he was saying i want to know your name who are you and he said i have jesus while persecutors without me because this is what he said why do you persecute me and he said who are you i'm trying to defend you i'm trying to stand for the law i'm trying to stand for jehovah who are you lord and he says i'm jesus so this is it's going to be hard to kick against the pricks because the sharpened wood on the on a cart that an animal would pull you know would would be there and they'd go to kick it it poked them as they kicked back against the cart and he says it's going to be hard kicking against the pricks why did you persecute me when you persecuted my people you persecuted me whatever you do to my church you're doing to me amen now as again he that light identified himself as the same one that wasn't jesus said that's my name amen i am that i am he's asking the same question that moses did who art thy lord what is your name i'm jesus he had pride he had lots of learning i want to just talk about this for a moment this this man he says in acts 22 and 3 i'm barely a man which i'm a jew born in tarsus a city in silica cicelia were yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamalia and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers and was zealous toward god as he are ye all are this day so paul says i've got all them awards i walked down the aisle there you know with pomp and circumstance you know i was in i was in the cumulative i was in this and i was in the host society and i i had the diplomas i had the phd behind my name and the lld and the dd i had it all am i was cocky i was so sure i was right boy i was educating all these letters underneath me they can't they're less than i am because i can judge a man's intelligence because how many degrees he has no none of them's are intelligent like i am them sorry things that them scum bags i'm going to kill them all he was cocky so sure he was right he persecuted the church do you know in the book of acts that church was called the way that's right that's what they call the christians call themselves we're in the way that's right we're the way you want to be saved we're the way. you want to go to heaven we're the way this one who led us is the way he's the way the truth and the life we're the way. this is the message somebody with me amen and i persecuted them because they called themselves the way and we were we were the ones we're the ones we're the we're why they don't know nothing they ain't got they've never been to bible school what are they doing handling the word ignorant learned peter preaching stuff oh he has no right to even preach don't that sound familiar william branham prayed and you called to pray for the sick he wasn't to preach the gospel he never was sent by us he don't have the degrees there's no phd behind his name there's nobody there's no credentials of man why what right what right does he have to preach these things he was not a preacher he was not a teacher he was to pray for the sick he had to get to healing he didn't know his calling because we're the ones we've got the phd in the lld and the dd and we're recognized by men in colleges and we walk down the silver cords and gold cords around our neck and you know with our gowns on in our house and we threw them up and we shouted and everybody put a big label on us and we're now a doctor well let me tell you what paul did with his doctrine what some of you need to do with your own knowledge philippians chapter 3 and verse 4 though i might have confidence in the flesh if any man thinketh he hath whereof he might trust in his flesh i moare circumcised the eighth day on the of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of the hebrews he thought pretty well of himself didn't he as touching the law of pharisee we did it every bit right down to the nitty-gritty we wouldn't even say the name of god till we lost it nobody knows how to say it no more concerning zeal persecuting the church touching righteousness which is in the law as blameless but what things were gained to me then i counted loss for christ yay doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellency for this knowledge of christ jesus my lord i count it all for loss i forget everything every man ever taught me for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i've suffered the loss of all things and to count them but done that i may win christ that's what paul did with his knowledge he said they're just a bunch of dung i count it as nothing just dirty mess of man are you with me so i can win christ that's right now paul knew that god couldn't use the knowledge and the understanding that he had received from one of the most learned rabbis of the day gamalia his name was renowned he was the rabbi the rabbi the teacher and like moses killed in the learning of physique of the of the egyptians remember some of them must kill people of the day builders of pyramids speaks they could embalm bodies they could make them where they could last thousands of years he said i esteem the reproach of christ greater than all that knowledge now that's the problem with denominations they can receive the dogmas and the teachings from the seminary but they can't receive revelation yet the church is to be built on revelations jesus said on this rock peter flesh and blood didn't reveal to you my father revealed it to you so on this this rock on the revelation of who i am i'll build my church now we come right back to it again remember again that's got to be our foundation that we know in whom we have believed that we know this is not a message with just the thinking of a mortal man this is almighty god [Music] don't look at the messenger look at the message and look at the vindication watch anointed once at the end time what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of god so by revelation and churches today don't even believe in spiritual revelation they believe in a dogmatic teaching of some system by revelation abel taught or offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than that of cain which god testified he was righteous amen i hope you see that see what where we're living see the hour i was talking to a gentleman not long ago a christian scholar and a gentleman and he said brother mr branham we refuse all revelation then he said you have to refuse jesus christ because he was the revelation of god god revealed in human flesh and unless you see it you're lost and that's the problem that most critics have with brother branham is that he wasn't taught by man paul was but he had to count it all but lost and then he would guarantee he would guarantee if this is not amount it is from god i didn't get my message from man i got it from god i certify [Applause] in fact for the matter he was so sure of it he said to preach or teach anything different than what i preached let it be accursed he was so sure it was god galatians 1 6 i marvel that you're so removed from him who called you into grace unto another gospel you see to believe something different you have to remove yourself from christ which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ and that perversion has went on and on and on and on and produced every denominational system there is today perversion of the original gospel but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you that what we have preached unto you let it be accursed as we said before so and i now i say now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then you have received let him be accursed for do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please men for if i yet please men i should not be the servant of christ so he said you know if i'm going to please man i can't be christ's servants if i'm going to be christ's servant it ain't going to please man but i certify what's these words i guarantee you i give you this guarantee that the gospel preached of me is not after man for neither i received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ now he had met jesus christ where in the pill of fire and it was the pillar of fire who taught him the revelation i'm trying to get to you to understand this is where true revelation and the divine interpretation of the word comes from is from the purify himself because no man has a right to interpret it only god himself for he is his own interpreter you've heard of my conversion my life or my conversation rather my life in time past in the jewish religion how beyond measure i persecuted the church of god i wasted it i profited i excelled in the jews religion above mine equals in mine own nation been more zealous of the of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace isn't this amazing when he please god you remember you were you were lost out in sin but when it pleased god he stopped you amen on your road down to damascus i mean he knocked you off your high horse he got you down in the dust until you begin to cry who are the lord i got to know you jesus and he says who separated me from my mother's womb called me by his grace to reveal his son in me so he said my revelation is a revelation of jesus christ that i might preach him among the heathen now notice i want to give something listen pray we are not preaching william branham we are not preaching william branham's thoughts we are preaching christ who has been revealed in his own word not outside the word but at the word now he said i confer not with flesh and blood oh listen immediately i didn't go talk to man about it neither when i went up to jerusalem to them that were apostles before me but i went to arabia over to the desert i returned again to damascus after three years i went up to to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him 15 days and but other apostles saw and unsaved james the lord's brother now these things which i write unto you behold before god i lie not amen notice this i'm certifying i'm guaranteeing you i didn't even get this from the disciples i've got this from the pillar fire himself and he's the one that helped me to write the new covenant and if any man thinks he's a prophet or if he's spiritual let him acknowledge that what i said to be the truth so we're going to have paul's gospel restored again it must be restored by jesus himself the pillar of fire and it can't come through human understandings of the bible it cannot come that way you see it just that would just make another another organization another denomination and we already got 40 000 different interpretations of the bible upon which manna denominated dear god we don't need another one amen all of them have been taught by a man and not one of them shall i say it not one of them teach paul's gospel holiness well they don't agree with paul they don't believe what what old paul said let me that was not all paul that was the angel of god are you with me oh they don't agree with paul no no no oh that was not for us you know that i tell you we've decided who are we who do you think you are the angel revealed it and you go against the angel listen let me tell you you go against the angel if an angel from heaven anyone preaches or adheres to any other gospel that's what i preach to you he's cursed you bring yourself under your own curse by denying paul's gospel because i certify it didn't come from man it came from a pillar of fire [Applause] amen the same one that wrote the old testament well i'll tell you what we don't believe the old testament the same one who are wrote the old testament is the same one who wrote the new testament he's the same god it's the same word it's the same problem amen water baptism they don't agree with paul godhead they don't teach what he teaches preached you see they believe they can change it they believe their idea above it is better than what old paul had when paul met him down in acts 19 he says how was you baptized well like john baptized he said you wasn't baptized in the name of jesus christ he said go and get it done over again because there's only one salvation in one name come on you say well it has nothing to do with salvation he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned god is the interpreter brother brandon said i was speaking here not long ago in a meeting a man said to me brother branham you have the wrong interpretation you don't interpret that right they go the methodist and they say the baptists don't interpret it right the baptists say the pentecost was done the pentacles say the wonders don't the one to say the assemblies don't and each one says the others don't god is his own interpreter he don't need anyone to interpret for him he does his own interpreting who is the man that can interpret god god is his own interpreter now listen this was the fault they found in jesus amen same fault he wasn't taught a man matthew 13 54 when he come to his own country he taught them in their synagogue in as much as they were astonished and they said well have this man this wisdom and these mighty works is not this the carpenter's son is not his mother called mary and his brethren james joseph and simon and judas and and his sisters are they not all with us which then have this man all these things and they were offended in him that that means that was a stumbling block to them the scriptural way for the word to be revealed was never through a seminary you showed me one place in the bible that the word of the lord came to a seminary in the license day it was the school of the prophets that elijah went up into heaven and then and they said well perhaps the lord just took him up and cast him on a mountain down into a valley it was a school of the prophets that threw wild gourds into a pot and death was in the pot it was the prophet elijah who said bring me some meal which represented christ and he threw it in there and the pot was healed and that's the only thing that healed the false doctrine is get christ back in the midst [Applause] amen you see it was the rabbis and the teachers of the law was the one who got the message distorted they're the ones who through their stupidity and legalism lost how to even say the name of god they couldn't even now say they're all god's names but now god would send a message down and say thou shalt call his name jesus jehovah's savior and there and there will be no salvation there'll be no deliverance there won't be no healing except by that name amen that's what the bible said acts 4 12 neither is there any salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we might be saved father won't save you come on a man's son won't save you holy ghost won't save you melchizedek won't save you lily of the valley black morning star there is no salvation in any of those there is only one name in which redemption is and that's the name of jesus christ and there's nowhere in any place in the bible anywhere where anybody was ever baptized except to be taken in that name all to the book of acts it's a name that rebukes sickness heal diseases save the lost now coming down i'm going to be closing here in a few minutes but i want to get it down to you at least that we can get some of this he said brother branham would talk about things now do we remember the angel lord came to him there in 1946 it was a pillar of fire and out of that walk to man he was six foot tall head on a white garment down his feet his hair was down down down about shoulder length and he stood there in into with brother branham he began to say i am sent from the presence of almighty god he just stepped out of that pillar of fire to tell you about your misunderstood life and your strengths ways and to commission you and tell you that you're to take a gift of healing to the sick people and i will be with you don't worry about what you'll say i will put the words in your mouth you remember that now it would be this angel service after service somebody with me this pillar of fire that would tell their names their address your name is eva york you're from 613 6th street you're you're you're healed it would tell them you know right down to the minute details of their lives because it was the logos using the voice of a man can you help me preach now he said and he said one time i read in the bible about hell and i began to read that the word hell came from the word hades which meant the grave and i was about three or four years i wouldn't preach on the subject of hell because one place it looked like it was a burning fire the next place it looked like it was a grave until i found the truth of it then i got to know exactly what it was and by the help of the angel of the lord that revealed it to me because i didn't get any schooling thank god and i just hold on to scripture and pray and search until the scripture the scripture until she comes and reveals it to me and when he stands before me in that light you see on the picture and reveals it every time it is perfect with the scripture through and through that's the reason i know it's the angel lord because he bears witness of his word and if that angel told me one thing that wasn't scriptural i would not believe him it's got to be with the word first god's word is eternal because an angel could come and preach something else paul said it wasn't right but if it's the word of god the angel of god will verify that word every time to be the truth if it's a true angel from the lord if it's something of color then don't you listen to it but if an angel comes and speaks and says just exactly what the word says then that angel is from god hallelujah now just as accurate as knowing the heart the angel brought the word it's a dark spirit of death around you it's in the form of cancer in the heart the doctor is a strong man you're examined by you gotta rupture condition the bowels you've got a stomach trouble besides you have a severe heart trouble that's caused you fainting a few days ago you were sitting on the side of the bed looking out toward your windows and nearly passed out your name is eva york you live in this city 613th 6th street you're going home to be well did he miss it did it fail not once of the thousands of times if it was that accurate come on then how about the what the angel said about the bible there was an entourage came to brother branham and told him said look if you'll just tell us what you're preaching about baptism in jesus name and the godhead and things like that so we'll believe you if you'll tell us the angel said it will believe you he said if the angel lord said anything contrary to that it wouldn't be the angel lord and he said you know if a man tells you a messenger from god says he's from god and tell you it's right to be baptized in the name of father son the holy ghost let him be a liar if a man tells you it's all right for you to wear bobbed hair and things like that you ought to cover with a hat in the church for a bonnet to be a covered let him be a liar the word of god is the truth and and any of those these things that is against the word let them be a lie it's the word it's the truth it'll stand now even the book of revelation how many believes the book of revelation well the book of revelation he says is one revelation one and one the revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him to show in his service things which must shortly come to pass and he sent it and signified it that means made it known by his angel to his servant john i'm trying to show you the entire bible not just the old testament but even jesus own ministry was from the father himself and the angel of the covenant brings even the book of revelation and he makes it known he signifies it by his angel to what his servant john now john's the messenger he writes down he's the scribe but it's the holy ghost that is bringing a message and i want to get you again let us certify it the message we've been seeing is not a man's message it's god's message blessed is he that readeth and they they hear the words of this prophecy and keep the things that are written in the end and they're in for the time is at hand look here it's the only it's it's the only book in the bible that's written by jesus christ in that manner he comes and appears to him and says signifies it to servant john personally reveal it to a scribe what is it it's the same pillar of fire that led the children of israel amen out of egypt into the promised land it's the same pillar of fire that wrote the law it's the same pillar of fire somebody with me amen that will lead joshua into the promised land and the conquest of that land it's the same pillar of fire that was with daniel in the lion's den hallelujah when the animals were afraid of that milling whipping fire and stood away from him it's the same one the fourth man that was there in the fiery furnace hallelujah it's that same one that we are following today not another but the same pillar of fire the same holy ghost we are a people led by the pillar of fire not another man's ideas not another man's wisdom but a pillar of fire god wants you to have confidence so he would show you sign after sign this is what he did with moses so that you'll know you were sent here take this rock cast it down it becomes a sermon see you can bind the king's serpent swallow him up this is what's going to happen under your ministry you're going to swallow up his whole army you'll take them down the red sea and they'll all die come on amen you know put your hand in your bosom bring it out it's leprous put it back in hey man it's white as snow right and then this was the condition this was the condition of every man he was leprous full of sin but put it there in the bosom of christ in the heart of christ where he was wounded for our transgression and bruised for our iniquity and pull it back out and it's white it's clean now rather it's clean it's no longer leprous with sin anymore that's the power that lays in the word it'll set the violet center free free it'll heal our it'll raise the dead he'll open the eyes of the fire he'll give hearing to the death it'll make brain bleed ain't meant to dissipate and go away it'll make anthony banish in a moment it is there because he said i am god nothing i will be but the i am and he's trying to show you this is the one who's speaking to you and didn't come from a seminary and if it did well if it came to the fact that some methodists don't want it if it came to the methodists the pentecostals don't want it you know but it came from god and i'm on it how about you it came from god and i want it it's my message it spoke to me because in him is life in him with lies and i was in him [Applause] hallelujah now then i'm bringing it right down to this because jesus would say i came from god i'm going back to god so where's that in the bible brother tim because watch him now he come from the pillar of fire he become flesh with the spirit of god overshadowing the virgin making a body the pillar of heart comes and dwells in him teaches him brings us the gospel now watch he's crucified he's raised up he's ascends back into glory his body now is immortal can never die again it is the only image of the father you'll ever see because no man has seen god at any time but the only begotten of the father he hath declared him and one day when you look for god you will see jesus christ but he says i come he said to paul i came from the spirit world i go back to spirit again this is why he would say if i don't leave the comforter can't come but if i go away then i can send the spirit that is in me back for he dwelleth in me now but he shall be with you and in you john 8 42 notice now this flesh was brought here for sacrifice to redeem us as sinners so the pillar of fire would become flesh john 8 42 jesus said unto them if god were your father you would love me i proceeded forth and i came from god and neither came i myself but he sent me so jesus said i came out of that pillar of fire watch now verse 23 of chapter 13 jesus knowing the father had given him all things in his hands and he said he was come from god and he went to god so notice here john 3 13 3 adriana jesus knowing the father had given him all things in the hand and that he was come from god and went to god so he came from god to become flesh man for god to dwell in but he would return back to being god again john 16 30. for are we now are we sure that thou knowest all things and needeth not that any man asked thee for by this we believe thou came us forth from god so there's three witnesses of the scripture so the body of jesus sits at the right hand of god in heaven on his throne but his spirit is here on the earth now remember the whole purpose that he come was because god wanted a family and he wanted them all born of the same spirit that he was and he couldn't call you family and you being a sinful human being because to really be family you would have to be of his genus right amen so there on the day of pentecost what happened the pillar of fire came down the logos the same one that led to children of israel the same one that was in jesus christ the same one come on that was on the road to damascus and said i am jesus the same one comes down on the day of pentecost and it comes like
