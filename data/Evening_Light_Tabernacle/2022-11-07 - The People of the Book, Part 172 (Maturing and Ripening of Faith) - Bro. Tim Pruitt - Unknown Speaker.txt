hold it before the Lord right now father as we go before your throne of grace how to lift my hand to you Lord those that are crossed the way that are listening in that joined in with us in this service today just hearing Lord from over in South Africa and then Uganda brother bus listening in joining in with us in the service and no doubt across the world many many others through Europe and Asia even will be listening in and Lord we pray that you'll bless your people we thank you Lord that we have the means provided that that at this moment we can travel as it were like a thought as our image and voice would be across the land that people will be hearing and you said it would be this way in a day when travel would be vastly increased Lord there are many places in the world we can't go but you can go there Lord and even today our voice goes there and so Lord because of that we we want to be conscience that we preach only the word of God Lord that we don't leave anybody astrayed but Lord it will lead him to the Cross to you if we can point them to you today their lives will be changed forever in your presence I pray Lord that you'll speak to us and that you'll Minister the word of God to our hearts in Jesus name amen amen God bless you thank you if you'll turn with me to Genesis 18 we'll read from the first verse Genesis 18 and verse 1. I'm sure this is getting familiar to you but we want to look at it again Genesis 18 and 1 and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory speaking of Abraham and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day God bless you can be seated want to just say it's good to be home amen good to be here among you Believers and we were privileged to be able to go into Switzerland they're flying to Geneva and um actually first we were met in the airport in the Netherlands by brother brother Dykstra the father-in-law to your daughter brother Matt's sister Mary so you know we got to visit with them and he bought us breakfast and then we flew on to Geneva and from Geneva we went on to um over into France with Brother David um and uh we just had a wonderful time there with the with the Mayors they were treated us royally and it was great great Genesis and Grace's host and um you know we uh of course we had that wonderful time together with them and his church is located just minutes from the Swiss border and so they hosted the meetings and I so appreciated their wonderful hospitality and you've enjoyed Brother David mayor Minister and here and and he's quite the speaker as you know and so we were we were blessed by um you know just having some time together and fellowshipping together and being able to minister he rented a hall for the meetings because he came in from all over from Germany over from um uh Belgium and from I think maybe from Holland and England some amazing some real efforts to just fly across the over into um from England over into Geneva and come over into France for the meetings there and and that was our brother Peter Chandler and also brother Jr by by Vega who ministers in his church and he came over to interpret the services into the French language and this allowed us to preach to people that we don't normally reach as you know I'm just not real good in the French language and it reaches a whole a whole new audience of people and so I've been invited to come there and also we had friends came over from Germany the family of my good friend brother Sigmar Colin Brian or Colin Brenner they were they came over his widow Sister Irene and two of his sons and a daughter and I was able to minister them and especially to his widow because brother Sigmar passed away coming up a year this December from covid and and the Lord called him home so it gave me a real opportunity to minister that family and we love them and appreciate them and and their love for the Lord and their desire to serve him other other notables that were there was um brothers friends house Francois lipicar of Switzerland and Brother David Iverson from Belgium and brother Peter Chandler from England and we just had a wonderful time ministering to the people I think they gathered from France and Switzerland and Germany and Belgium and uh and many other places around and we streamed to far away countries some entire churches just um joined in with us for the meetings and so we just had a great time together we had nearly 800 connections every service where we were reaching some of them would represent a church of 200 people or so that we were ministering to so it gave us a tremendous opportunity to to bring the Gospel of Jesus Christ and encourage the bride of Christ you know we have a responsibility for that we're not in this alone and I'm glad we're not alone you look around and you see who sits next to you aren't you glad you're not here by yourself amen but there are others who love the Lord and encourage you in the present truth and and God has a bride from every Kindred and tribe and tongue and nation and people sometimes you know you wonder well brother Tim why would you be interested in them why don't you just tend to your own little church and and why would you be interested in them because you know no matter how ready that we might be to or think we're ready to go and we're ready for the Rapture uh the Rapture is a little different from getting the Holy Ghost you get the Holy Ghost you can be the only one to meet against the Holy Ghost but um when we come to Rapture we're taking everybody they're not leaving a hoof behind and we're all going together at the same time so you know if if I can help somebody else get dressed and ready then that's what we want to do Amen to encourage them to to move forward in the things of God Amen good to see you sister Helen so nice to have you must mean the baby is near huh come in close all right well I've got Grandma in all the way from Canada so that's wonderful and take our love back to brother Abe we we love him he's a tremendous brother and we so appreciate him so much well I appreciate you all my brother Dan and sister danette's here God bless you so nice to have you in service after such a battle that y'all have been through and but we have we have a prayed with you and for you all along the way how many has been praying for them all right well thank you for those prayers and at the end of the service we're all going to have prayer for sister tonight she's going and been going through a little battle there with had cancer in the spine and they were able to remove that and they've done some some uh some radiation treatments there on on that area and she's progressing being able to you know she because she lost the use of her Limbs and so she's progressing able to use them more and more and we're just believing that step by step that she's just going to walk right into a a well body amen so that's what we do is we hold before us the image of a perfectly healed person and then step by step we walk into that so today is just another step along the journey amen I saw brother James lingo there with his two sons got to meet them at the at the sale the other day and and got to shake their hands and they said this is the difference kind of church than what we've been to said you know this and we don't get bored here and so you know there's always something that is happening we just thank God for working on their lives and they see what God did for their daddy they know God can do that for them amen as you know God took and transformed his life in just a moment and that's the power of our Christ to be able to do that and to change a life and that's what it's about you know um preaching of the Gospel is casting out Devils amen and that's what happens when you get saved the devil is cast out and God comes in to live in the life and there's a king on that throne and if you get heal it's the devil cast out not that you were a devil but that the Tormentor had to leave so we know that that's the power of the of the blood of Jesus Christ and what he is he is able to do for us and and so you know it's good to be home next weekend I'm going to be gone again by the Timothy and I are going to the wedding of Joshua and Alexandra Pruitt they're getting married on next Saturday and um I believe you know to do what we can to try to invest in our young people and so I want to be there for them in that they ask me to be a part of that wedding so we're going to do that and Minister for brother Wendell while we're there and uh so you know we we uh there's just a lot to do and the Lord has been with us every step of the way I want to thank you for your prayers I made it through the trip of 10 hours of across the sea that when all the travel actually it's 24 hours from the time you get up to the time you get in bed it's 24 hours from from bed to bed if you know what that means it takes 24 hours to get home 24 hours to get over there but 10 hours of that journey is just in a in a seat going across the sea and the Lord was with us and was gracious and I I'll have to say I I had less pain and less problems than any time and I don't know how long amen so I thank you for your prayers hey man I couldn't help but think of that as I walked you know we'd go for a walk around some of the pretty lakes in Switzerland they'd let me take me out for a little walk every day and some walk about a mile and a half and come back in no pain I'll tell you it's the grace of God so I want to thank you for your prayers and believing with me and and praying for me I I tell you the Lord has undertook and we thank him you know I I don't have any granddose ideas that I will be feeling like I'm 15 years old again but um you know I want to feel pretty good for 68 right amen that's what I say to people a lot of times we pray for them and say well now take step by step into a perfectly well well body but you know if you're 70 years old don't expect to feel the 18 expect to have it perfectly well 70 year old amen so you don't get your expectations right because until we're changed we're going to still have a lot of aches and pains our 50 year old our new 50 year old up there brother Tim Winters come dragging in this morning's well I got a pain I said I I know what it means you know you're 50 now and it don't get better from now you know it gets uh you know and if you're you're laughing at us you'll you'll be here too soon too soon amen life just comes and goes just like that but you know living for Jesus is an adventure amen Walking with God is it's just going from glory to glory amen so we love you all and appreciate you all and and we just heard some wonderful things of the meetings that you've had you know the Lord has blessed us with such Convention Services time after time and it's just marvelous what the Lord has been doing in our midst and people say well you can't have services like that all the time who said amen who said you come under expectation God will move so you know you you expect God to move God will meet your expectations he responds to your faith so you believe in him with all your heart and surrender your life to him now I want to just pick up from the scripture from verse 9 of chapter 18 and read down to verse 15 to just kind of give us the context for where we're speaking today and I'm going to be speaking on the ripening maturing and the ripening of our faith so the maturing and the ripening of our faith you know Sarah was a woman that was a Believer but um you know she she had to have her faith ripened and had to have it directed because sometimes it would even be misdirected by reasoning into the wrong direction and of course that produced a new smell but anyway in this in verse 9 and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said beholden the tent and he said I will certainly returning to thee according to the time of life and Lo's Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent which was behind him now it tells her circumstances now Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed and within herself saying have I'm wax on shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham why for did Sarah life saying shall have a surety bear a child which him own is anything too hard for the Lord isn't that wonderful amen at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son and Sarah denied saying I laugh not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou did his life now today is we're looking at this every man and woman boy and girl that's born again of the spirit of God has a Measure of Faith in fact to matter you can't come to God except that you believe that he is and that he rewards those that diligently seek him and brother Branham made this statement that I think is still pertinent to the time that we're at I believe the church is beginning to hear the message and beginning to understand it but friend listen we got to lay in the presence of the Sun we've got to be ripened our faith isn't right now listen brother Brandon I'm saying this our faith isn't ripe intellectually we're hearing the message it says no we're not hearing the message but intellectually we're here now that God has given us and seeing the signs that he showed us and proven it by the Bible is there but all how the church needs to lay in his presence till it tenders up you know and gets sweet in the spirit so he can just bathe down sometimes in speaking the message you get harsh and have to break in like that because you've got to clinch a nail to make it whole but when the church once gets it and the elected is called out and separated then in the presence of God I know it will be something like the people were there when it takes the Rapture and in context he was speaking of when he went beyond the curtain of time and what was there was the fullness of the Holy Ghost so let me read it like this but when the church gets it and is set out and an elected and called and separated then in the presence of God I know it'll be like it was there with the fullness of the Holy Ghost when it takes the rapture so now again ripening doesn't mean that a mature Church won't have the supernatural works of God of healing and miracles and tongues and prophecy and shouting and dancing in the spirit that is not immaturity those things happen in a mature Church now rather ripening is to change our faith from an intellectual belief to a real living faith that works you see faith that doesn't work is dead amen so we want a faith that that is alive amen because you can have faith and it's dead because he said faith without works is dead faith so you can have faith if it doesn't have works it's dead but real faith is a living faith and that Living Faith produces works that follows that faith that proves is alive now you know it's one thing for us to say well Jesus is Alive the whole world is saying that but it's another thing for our faith to be alive and our faith has to be quickened or Made Alive in order for it to work now brother branham's gift was to tune the faith in other words you see that's what Sarah's Faith needed here it was all Out Of Tune and and it was tuned until it just had a dead sound it's kind of like somebody tuning an instrument a guitar you know and say well that that string is dead you know it's it's not ringing with life it's not making the right sound it's not matching the note and our our faith has to match the note of the Bible of the word of God Amen this is what we want God to do is to raise our faith up to a level where it matches what God's word said and when it matches what God's word said then you're healed or you're saved or delivered or whatever the need is it works when it matches what God's word said now some Faith you see like as Sarah's faith it was all Out Of Tune you can see here she's in the presence of God the almighty and us and has has to be asked of God himself is there anything too hard for me you see because she was still looking at things and it was too hard you know even for God it was too hard you know I it's it's impossible I'm old you know shall I have pleasure now with my Lord him his old also you know this is uh this is way out and she is kind of laughing or scoffing as she's hearing this because her faith is Out Of Tune and this is what's the matter with a lot of people in fact to the matter is when you get sick you know what happens there is the dampness of that unbelief comes along and the strings of your faith gets loose and it is not matching God's word in fact it'll start ringing out what the doctor said and you know beaten to that rather to what God's word said but it has to be tuned until it matches the level of God's promise now Faith of course will produce an atmosphere where that Miracles can happen amen faith will produce an atmosphere even where our bodies will change so you see in order for us to be changed we've got to be tuned up and we've got to be brought up into an atmosphere of faith and a believing that word that all things are possible and that there is nothing too hard for the Lord now brother Branham told us in the message of Moses he said now he said friend um he talked about his gift he said that doesn't heal nobody that only brings the person up in faith and then when the person's here he might come and tell me he's got faith and I take his word for it but when you're under the anointing as it is now you can't come and deceive that where I know when you've got faith or not he might think he has Faith there's a thing that people thinks that got faith when they haven't got a faith isn't that right when they're way down here saying they got faith and and it isn't up here it's like tuning a string on an instrument and when it comes up and coincides with this up here then the thing is ready and any demon listen to this any demon that's got that person bound has to turn loose when that kind of Faith Comes amen and he said you don't have to be up here it'll act out there Wherever You Are amen amen and you know that is true we had one great example it wasn't a prayer line it wasn't even hands laid on but right there as the word went forth and the singing went forth sister Lana sitting back in the mezzanine but in the atmosphere of Faith her faith got tuned to the level of the promise and she acted upon that and when acting upon that God healed her amen so it doesn't take even coming up for prayer that's good in that scripture but you can receive it right in your seat even the Holy Ghost can be that way I can remember you know as I was preaching a word the word many years ago and a man that was a backslider and away from God and and uh done some horrible things really hard to believe when you're a backslider makes it really difficult and so when they come back you know trying to come back and trying to believe and he'd picked up smoking and it was a bad habit and one pack after another that he and he couldn't lay it down and right there is I was preaching he screamed out I'm delivered I'm delivered I'm delivered never to pick that thing up again you see it's when our faith matches the level of God's promise and you just accept from him what he's done for you at Calvary now so you see in order to and now in order to have the end time you've got to have the spirit of the end time and of course we know the solemn world is in the spirit of the end time but so must the bride be in the spirit and the atmosphere of the end time I'm not talking about their fear their unbelief their sodomy I'm not talking about being in that Spirit I'm talking about the spirit of God that is Promised for an end time people where he said in the last days I will pour out all of my spirit [Applause] Hallelujah I'm going to empty the contents of it amen the pony in time people Hallelujah cause I've got an end time Plan and there's going to be a people of perfect faith a people whose Faith exceeds the face of any other age because it's a rapturing faith was saying how in the world are we going to do this just like it happened to Sarah because it was Grace it came by Sarah's way after all of those years of unbelief a man to turn her heart back to Faith to believe in again so it's a Rapture in Grace for a Rapture and faith amen how's God going to do it he's going to give you the grace for it his grace provides the faith for the going away you are a people favorite of the Lord and this is what the angel was coming by to tell Sarah you are favored you are called you are predestined this is your moment I am here for this reason this is why I'm appearing this is why Seven Angels were in the cloud this is why the seven Thunders Lord their voices this is why the book was unsealed this is why the Mysteries are revealed is because it's you that I'm getting your faith whether it's ripe for a rapture all right now so you've got to be in in time conditions under an end time atmosphere that's why Brothers of the message it's not going to take it's got it's got to be more than a Baptist atmosphere Presbyterian atmosphere you know an intellectual atmosphere is going to take a supernatural atmosphere for the Bride of Jesus Christ now in the message perseverance brother Branham said I want to speak on the subject to kind of build up that faith well you know brother Tim we don't need Faith anymore by the time we're too mature we're way too mature for faith well to you that are fallen behind you know brother Branham preached perfect faith and we don't just need faith we need a perfect faith that and that perfect Faith produces Apostolic times now brother Branham left here declaring that we are still in an Apostolic age I don't normally take off my coat but it's a little warm up here so I might as well amen now I want you just to think of this because we need a perfect faith that produces Apostolic times because we are in the final the finality of the pouring out of God's spirit so this is the crescendo of the apostolic age now so he said so he said here I want to speak on the subject to kind of build up Faith ministers knows that when you're speaking to the people you have an atmosphere of preaching for salvation then you want to make a a call that call to that and then if you want the atmosphere for healing you get to anointing Yourself by the word of God delivered to the people and that puts the whole group under and the anointing for a certain thing otherwise under expectations of certain things and we see we're expecting something so you know I believe then to bring that a little higher that God's got all his church now the called out remnant of his church under expectations of his coming so we're here under the expectations of his coming this is the age of harvest time this is the age of his coming the Harvest represents when the son of man comes and he harvests the Grain and takes it into the Garner the difference between this age and the early Apostolic age because we're not repeating Pentecost we are the continuation of the book of Acts not a reputation a repetition of the book of Acts we are not repeating Pentecost we are finishing Pentecost this is a day where the the day of Pentecost fully comes we have been in seven Church ages seven weeks which are the weeks of Pentecost but now we are in the final age and the final time where there's got to be a sheath waved in the end time of a mature elect bride of people who knows their word the word of God a people who does exploits now so he said I want to bring them under the expectations of his coming this is where we're at we're in a Rapture age where everything should be under the expectation of maturity mature Faith mature gifts materials how mature brother Tim on that healing till our bodies are changed come on remember we've still got a ways to go it ripening that's right now brother Brandon preached the sermon wisdom versus faith in somehow the devil is slipped in among us to lead some to believe that the Holy Ghost is just a learned behavior to them intellectual concepts are taught you mature by applying these Concepts the calling of the fourth of the Bride is not an intellectual Revival and that's seemingly what many have had for the past 50 years is trying to intellectually assimilate the message and brother Brandon said I believe you are beginning to do that intellectually hear it but your faith needs ripen it amen and I'll tell you after 50 years of good intellectual teaching it's time for ripening the faith a faith that is not dead but a faith that works now so you see the calling forth the bride is not an intellectual Revival It's Supernatural and its power is not in giving a learned behavior it is the power of a change life you see I mean the AAA will teach an alcoholic learn behaviors going to change your behavior patterns and they use psychology to do that you know remember it hurts you it hurts your family it hurts your friends it's not helpful avoid it so now take these steps to to avoid it and to do this and do that and they give them a learned behavior but every time they smell alcohol is still there every time they see it is still there but this gospel is not a learned behavior it is the power of transformation its power lays in a change life that the sins that I used to do I do them no more I don't desire that anymore I don't want that anymore I can pass by every beer joint I'm not tempted I can see somebody use the alcohol I don't want it why because it is not just a learned behavior it is a change life another Tim why would you why would you speak about these things because I've been in men's meetings where men get up and say you know well I've overcome pornography because I remember I hurt my wife and it's hurting my family and how that's you know wrong and I remember and I associate that with the pain that he caused of the confession and the hurt that it brings and and so I've learned to associate pain with that behavior so that I don't repeat it friends that's not the gospel it is not a learned behavior it is the power of Christ under salvation amen your whole attitude your whole disposition your whole atmosphere has changed it gives a power and a young man I don't care if he's 16 in the heights of of his passion are you with me right now amen and he can with the Holy Ghost can lift his head and turn away from every prostitute every evil dressed woman he can bring his mind subject back to the word of God it's a power that is in him it's not a learned behavior now I'm going to stop here for a moment because David had a learned behavior I'm talking about King David he learned the law Thou shalt not commit adultery he took and he tied the word as frontless before his eyes he had it over at the emblems of it over the doorpost he had every bit of that learning from a child Thou shalt not commit adultery and here's what happens to a man or woman who does they stoned him in that day amen he knew the penalty he knew the hurt he knew the same but he didn't have the power when he looked over and saw Bathsheba he didn't have the power to resist it and he went all around his learned behavior all around the recorded scriptures all around his memory verses and went and committed adultery anyhow but if you ever get that heart changed it does not desire evil there is a power that lays within you that brings your body subject and I think that don't say that they don't have passion anymore it's still there temptation is still there but the power is not a learned behavior and considering consequences it is something that is a life change you would no more do that than nothing no more than a lamb would eat pig slop come on no more than you would go and lap up dogs vomit you're not a dog anymore you've been changed that's moment to you that sin that's wrong that's evil it's repulsive and I tell you that that's what we need is a new birth that sin becomes where it makes you sick yeah where you hate evil and you love righteousness and you turn from the things of the world to the things of God you see when you were born you were born with a like a magnet setting in your heart has got poles and it's got like a magnet it pulls and it resists see you know you were born wrong with your heart twisted and turned toward evil so automatically you started doing wrong because you were pulled toward it the pose of your heart pulled you toward doing wrong and you would say you might hear Mama say don't do that or daddy said that'll hurt you but there was something just kept pulling you that direction you went that way in spite of all the training all the moral teaching all the Sunday school teaching all the preaching you ever heard you went on that way because you were pulled naturally that way because the magnet of your heart was was the pole was set toward unbelief and I believe in sin so you were pulled towards sense and naturally you gravitated toward the wrong kind of music their own kind of friends the wrong kind of thinking the wrong everything towards sin you did it because that's the way your heart was set after one of them was born that way but the gospel comes and it turns it around now remember you pull towards sin and you resist God so you resist the altar call you resist what God Said you resist the righteous teaching of your mother and dad you resist that and push it against it pull toward the world then the gospel comes and what does he do it turns a heart and when it turns to Heart it pulls you toward God it pulls you toward righteousness hey your attraction has changed and you got a resistance to sin to evil to wrong you've got a resistance to it because the pose of your heart has been changed that's why Malachi 4 had to come is to turn the hearts from disbelieving to believe it so Sarah's heart had to be turned because she was being pulled toward right on into death without your child without the promise pulled that way and and actually she she might Listen by now she may have already heard that that God had come down and sell shed eye and said Sarah's going to have a child and this is going to be our new name she still don't believe she resists but now he comes and stands right in front of her Grace do you ever realize it isn't it wonderful you didn't go looking for God God went looking for you come on Sarah wasn't looking for God God came looking for Sarah where is Sarah and God came looking to you where is this one or where is that one and he called your name Hallelujah I brought you to a face-to-face confrontation with him well you had to face the question with all of these troubles all of these scars all of these hurts all of these problems all of these sins is there anything too hard for God so I settled that a long time ago we'll get sick you'll have to settle it again you'll face it right again you'll have to come back right around that question whether he ask you is there anything too hard now so the calling forth of the Bride though is an intellectually done the end time message did not come by intellectual reasoning or study it came as Angels descended and Revelations came from the pillar of Fire the message came from the Realms of Glory it did not come from the Mind of Men I'm out you know God has every way he wants something preached so I'm not worried about that but I do want you to know you know after after preaching those hours and then ministering personally for hours to others I lost my voice and so it's just barely coming back but I'm here after hours of travel and jet lag and sleepless nights to minister to you today so I want you just to tune in for a minute don't let it handicap you right now let the word of God sink in deep now because you see true maturity and rightness I want you to understand is not a dry formal religion that's the description of a dry dead blade tosseling shuck life is in the grain amen whenever when life is gone from the shout in the Harvest Time and when it's gone from the stock when it's gone from the root even when it's all gone it's left everything life is in the grain we must expect life in the grains amen now baking the greenness and the immaturity out doesn't take away the power of God and signs and wonders baking the greenness out does not take away the life of the Holy Spirit or or the joy of the Holy Ghost any Ministry I'm going to say something any Ministry without Divine Healing Miracle signs and wonders is a green Ministry unripe I'm not saying you're not grained now I'm saying you're immature because of mature ministry will have the power of the resurrected Christ in it I'm trying to get you to understand what maturity is in this type because true maturity will have the ministry of the resurrected Christ in it now educating people into the Bible truth is not the gospel the gospel is the power of God in the men's heart that gives an appetite and a hunger for truth brother Branham was explicit the seed word cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom's knowledge and as soon as wisdom mixes with faith faith dies right there and and this is what so many have done today they have taken what was to be faith and turned it to knowledge and a knowledge-based message brings death not life remember Ismail is born out of knowledge and reasoning Isaac is born out of Supernatural God actually had to make the seed alive make the womb alive make Abraham as well as Sarah Alive come on there had to be the miraculous done and Faith put in their hearts to believe so Isaac is born of the supernatural now again as we look at it Eve for example let's go to her for a minute we know that's where the original sin began she had the promise of the word of God to be fruitful and multiplying replenish the Earth that was the word now the servant came along with his wisdom saying you know God made you for this purpose oh yeah well um sure you know he said I would be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and and but if we partake of that we'll die and using them reason and he said but oh do you think a loving father a loving God would do a thing like that and she listened to wisdom to reason and took his wisdom before he said it's a tree that's a delight that one to be desired for and she fell for it and now you see the seed that she was holding for that was to see the Promise because he had a word that said be fruitful multiplied replenish the Earth what if she would have finally become Mother by the will of God through a spoken word but she couldn't wait so she listened to Satan's reason and took an intellectual thought rather than waiting on the Supernatural and God's timing for it to happen amen but you know that word still came to pass not an eve it passed over thousands of years till they found another virgin and this Virgin Mary would say be it unto me according Thy Word I don't know a man well how's it going to be it won't be through a man it'll be the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit and the word that Eve turned down Mary took Hallelujah and when she took that word It produced Christ and from that seed came ever born again child of God a new generation a new creation a new species oh I could preach right now I'm talking about a new species that the devil didn't know what to do with Hallelujah he'd see the Moses he'd seen an Aaron he'd see the David he'd seen a Noah he'd seen this and he seen that one but he never seen any like these on the day of Pentecost there was a hundred and twenty of them filled with the life of God staggered out of the upper room speaking in other tons in a Heavenly language thank you a people who could not be deceived they were a new species they wouldn't do what he did come on somebody I tell you I'm preaching to a brand new species a people the devil don't know what to do with [Applause] because there's a bride bringing forth in this day of the Original Seed the spoken word is the Original Seed and out of that original seed comes an original group of people that are like that 120 of the day of Pentecost of people the devil don't know what to do with he can't stop him he can't make him quit he can't make him turn back oh what the devil saw the day of Pentecost was a bunch of men and women under the influence Hallelujah I can almost freaking comes right now under the influence of a mighty Angel hear the spirit of God came down and God bear 120 just like him laughs he looked out of there and said what have I done by crucifying this one here birth out of him is 120 more dislike them and three thousand more were added to the kingdom hallelujah what did he say about this safe and I saw another Mighty angel and there are people today that have been burnt under the influence of that Mighty angel there are people the devil don't know what to do with he's offered in the world he's offered him Sodom he's offered him every kind of sin he's already ever kind of happened every kind of the world but he don't know what to do with these [Music] foreign [Applause] I can't make them disbelieve I can't get them to turn around I can't get him to dive I can't get him to disbelieve anymore what the devil saw the day of Pentecost was men and women filled with deity filled with the power of God what the devil is sealed he had to lay on the CNA right here in the evening like Tabernacle if men and women filled with the same deity [Music] the Unstoppable pride of Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] [Applause] how many fields that way this morning I will not quit I will not turn around I am not a compromiser amen I can't be stopped I will overcome well he said he'll overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony [Applause] you know why because the words come right down here and found another virtue who will conceive just like Mary did of the supernatural instead of trying to pass the message on intellectually so God had given a word he couldn't take it back be fruitful and multiply and replace here with Mary I mean Eve didn't do that she brought forth but she brought forth to other serpents words and through his knowledge he brought forth us into death because of that we were all born wrong that's why it requires a new birth so you have to be born the second time over again because you were born wrong the first time but the second Birds by Earth not mixed with Creeds of man and on man's ideas not received intellectually but a supernatural overshadowing of the Holy Ghost now brother Brandon told us holy ghost seeds of the Bible ten I cannot cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom that kills every seminary in the country now I'm sorry I I understand you some of you feel like I'm fighting when I say this but we got too many Seminary preachers in this message we got too many Seminary churches that have tried just to teach the concepts of Truth and pass it on intellectually now he said that kills every seminary in the country because the Bible cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom that kills every seminary in the country that knocks the holes right out through them punctures them and the Judgment Flows In that's right certainly does because the word cannot grow with wisdom worldly wisdom both wisdom and faith will produce an atmosphere now this is why brother Branham said I'm going to ask you something this is wisdom versus Faith do you ever go into church and say this reverently now just to make a point God forbid did you ever go into church where the pastor is real starchy the congregation is the same way that's right what is it it's that atmosphere that brought it go into a place where the pastor says now wait a minute there's no such a thing as that nonsense I don't believe in such thing as Divine Healing about the baptism of the Holy Ghost you'll see every one of them congregation now listen granted you ain't gonna get a message preacher nowhere to say there's no no such thing as Divine Healing or about the baptism of the Holy Ghost but what they do is they say but this is not the season for it you see it was at that time where God was doing something back there but he's not doing that now well we better get something going because we got to have such total massive Divine Healing the gray hair come back to the right color again wrinkles fall off and a healing comes massive Divine Healing from the top of the head to the soles of the feet So Divine Healing faithful Divine Healing is only miniature Rapture in faith did you get that amen it's only miniature Rapture and Faith because that faith is enlarged not just to heal a heart replace it or you know give you 10 more years of life or six more like he did says to Karen amen but a massive total Divine Healing where every part of your body is turned back to 18 Again we do believe that don't we So Divine Healing is only miniature Rapture and faith if you don't have them have the miniature Faith how are you ever going to enlarge that you become Rapture in faith that's why brother Branham said if I can't get you to believe for even Divine Healing how am I going to get you to believe for Rapture and faith but healing's not going to be there where it's not preached come on amen so he said so he said do you ever go into church where the pastor reels starching congregations the same way that's right what is it it's that atmosphere that brought it go into a place for the Pastor said now wait a minute there's no such thing as that nonsense I don't believe it's such thing as a Divine Healing about that baptism of the Holy Ghost you see every one of them the congregation and listen he said if there's an eagle in there somewhere he'll get out amongst that bunch of chickens uh sure will exactly the truth he'll leave it yeah he sure will he can't stand that he's an eagle he's Sky built not a barnyard now as the Eagles turns his announced he said he said um in his prayers said Lord be merciful to me and he said he said he's inviting his congregation to pray this like this give me Eagle thoughts give me Eagle desires give me Eagle life let me fly in your blue yonder Lord where all things are possible to them that believe make a faith in me let my wings grow let my faith muscles around my wings grow till I can really see Jesus amen Eagle life Eagle desires Eagle thoughts soaring above the unbelief of the age listen in the ground the grounded prison of Sarah's tent she needed Eagle Faith to get out of there now God's looking for men he said who can climb up in the Heights like an eagle take his flight go on Plumbing the Heavenly Yonder where all these things are possible about this Earthbound clucking down here hitting on four cylinders in the water jacket bursted on the inside don't even know how to be baptized yet oh my and all that fussing going on we fly away from it why yes I think there's friends if the whole nation stood in awe watched through the television when the countdown come for that Astronaut John Glenn to leave absorb his first flight towards the moon to get up above it to hold Earth Stood a maze as they've seen that astronaut take off what will the whole universe stand still when that great eagle of the Church of God when she spreads her great Wings one of these mornings propelled by the Holy Ghost and Fire when she takes her shiver off the Earth and goes in the Heavenly the whole universe will know it angels will welcome him into with a Triumph amen where living in the astronaut age going in the heavenlies people can't understand it when you talk about a shock coming just wait until the church starts moving up when that great eagle called The Church of God Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ spreads forth her wings and the power of the Holy Ghost begins to lift her up off the Earth it's going to be a wonderful time remember an automobile can't follow it neither can an airplane it's astronaut let's be an astronaut let's believe God Hallelujah there was a little mother and daddy brought about a oh I don't know precious little three four or five-year-old child up I couldn't speak their language but it was translated to me that the baby girl had had a genetic disease with this genetic disease she seemed to be a little mentally and and stunnied in her growth so I'm not real sure how old she was but it was a desperate situation and there as they told me that I had just smiled and and spoke some words to her I said now I'm going to pray for this child I want you to confess every day that is healed I want you to tell this child every day that Jesus has healed it and she's going to be well and that she will will do beyond what the doctors have said and I prayed for that child and the mother wrote back to Brother David and said all through the night all I could do is see brother Kim's face it would keep appearing to me as a smile on his face as he looked down upon my child and said it's given me such a hope and I told Brother David I said well you know in 1970 I met a woman and and and she she was she was there in our home just before Karen and I got married and and then she she was a pastor's wife and and she told me something and then she met me again in Florida a few years ago and she told me told me about um her condition and what had happened to her and reminded me it all came flooding back to to me her name was Sister Anderson and they pastored for a little while before Daniel did in Coal Lake Mississippi and that church troubled him so bad until he would twist his hair you know and until his hair had bald spots all over because of the pressure of that ungodly unbelieving butts did but nevertheless he'd come over to visit us and she told us about it and she told me again in Florida her husband's going to be with the Lord she said brother Tim I was five years old the doctors and the checkups said your child is mentally and it will never progress it'll never have more than a three-year-old you might as well realize that we as scientists are in our scientific Community doctors we have no cure for this there's no hope for it so do I only hope you got lady is to find somebody who believes in prayer this doctor said that believes in prayer that lay hands on this child and pray the prayer of faith over and the mother said her mother said well we're Pentecostals he said that's good take her to a meeting and get her prayed for that's your only hope so she said about that time down into Quincy Louisiana Brother Gary you know where that is it was about 1945 or six so I must have been 46 after the angel came because brother Branham came to Louisiana and was down into Quincy he calls talks about this later haven't been down there at Quincy Louisiana and so you know he said they her brother Brandon was going there and he'd met with an Angel and the presence of God was they're real and and the atmosphere was right for the sick to be healed said they took me to that meeting and said brother Brandon prayed for me and in that meeting said I was healed and here she was now 80 years old come across from the Carolinas to Florida to come and see me because she'd know me when I was a boy preacher and hear me preach again and talk to him again and remind me of this amen that our God there is no limits [Applause] oh Hallelujah your child may be deformed your baby may be where it's totally impossible for doctors but I tell you what don't give up hope [Applause] Hallelujah bring her to a place where there's Faith where there's an atmosphere an atmosphere that is produced where miracles happen [Applause] no wonder she could see my face all night because I know the power of my Christ I know what he can do I know the power of the blood of Jesus Hallelujah that not only can take a child with a genetic problem that is so is a memory or whatever the case is that he can not only heal that but he can take somebody that is so Diamond the depths of sin that it seems like it's impossible that they could ever be saved I believe all over them and they're crippled up as that little child is and God by his transforming power can change them in a moment Hallelujah in a moment I'll tell you what we need to be an astronaut in our faith the Eagles in our faith what we we can look down on any disease that is summed underneath us we can look down on every sin say it's underneath us [Applause] think about an eagle he can slip right down and snatch you up where he is my brother Joe preaching about her pose harpazo where the Greek word says sees or snatch up and God will smash you up right out of a situation I believe we're under legal anointing amen I I believe that with all of my heart I believe in a miracle working God and I told that little mother let me tell you when Atlanta bucks was healed one day she has black lungs [Music] but guess what it took a recreation can you imagine a re-creation of cells spoken word is hallelujah creative words going forth and change that lung till in the next morning a black lab is cancer-free with only well self that gives the miraculous power of God created work and if you can create new cells there he can create new cells for you today Danette that's the way our God is Hallelujah if you need a child and everything's out of whack in your body he can recreate new cells Hallelujah whatever it is just God there is nothing too hard for him wisdom versus faith we find out those atmospheres and you get in where faith is taught in a church you'll find the church in that atmosphere let me say it again quote brother Brown wisdom versus faith and when you give you get him where faith is taught in a church you'll find a church in that atmosphere he said oh God let me get this to you so if you can see it that's the reason people come among the saints for the praying believers Paul said he didn't find any of the city Only Timothy that was like Precious faith that he had you know the rest of them were all denominationalism but when he got in that atmosphere see he you find you find things going on that the atmosphere has created you find people living by faith when you get to the place into a place where it says well my the Bible's true God heals you walk around our congregation to say why I was done with cancer I was healed I was once blind David Dexter I see amen that stranger said give me why you mean what's the matter with you I'll show you on my record come home with me come eat dinner with me I'll show you something I got a record up there my neighbors know I was in this kind of condition I was paralyzed for years I was Supreme for what what is it the word in that church that group of Believers has created that atmosphere Hallelujah amen the word in that church in that group of Believers has changed that atmosphere well brother Jim we preached the word like that that atmosphere right there well you ain't preaching all the words because if you preach the Full Gospel healings in it the Holy Ghost is in it well we have the word here brother Timmy ain't nobody weeps their way yet Calvary at an altar you're not preaching the whole word you got part of the word or maybe it's just the intellectual is not mixed with faith but when you mix it with faith something happens amen that's what you come in services like this and even did you know I'm going to tell you something and brother Branham even brother Brandon even made this clear he talked about Tommy Osborne just taking the word itself by preaching the word so Miracles and signs and wonders without a gift just with the word preached so it don't take a special gift it takes the word preached to tune the faith to believe now he got that part on Divine Healing but he couldn't get all of it she's trinitarian and and so on like that but you see we're not a people like that we're people who believe the whole word Hallelujah so we ought to see the whole results [Applause] listen I I I'm not trying to get some Divine Healing campaigns going and this and that I'm just finding out what's in there in our inheritance that's all I'm doing amen I'm not just trying to have a you know a church and every church is a a prayer line and never ever service is a an altar call and you know hey when when when when it happens it needs to be done but nevertheless I'm not that's not what we're striving for we're striving to preach the entire gospel the entire gospel laughs like somebody sent me a quote another Minister sent a quote out we need to be well steady what we do and we've been well studied I have been well studied I know what the word says amen I don't want to go to Boston like the Apostle Paul did but I could amen I could but nevertheless that's not what our goal is is to try to boast in her own self I'm just saying though listen friends we should be well studied but that that that receiving the word must be more than intellectual it's got to be Supernatural gospel the things you think on the things you do the actions the things you talk about creates an atmosphere in wisdom versus faith brother Branham said how is now how is the word in this Simplicity yet in its completeness ever grow in a place where knowledge overshadows that and says it can't be so it can't where knowledge is preached from a seminary the children die and when faith is preached from the word to children live amen that's the difference just life and death that's the same thing that happened in the Garden of Eden that's exactly what happened to them two atmospheres there when Eve got off the right one on the wrong one she died it'll do it every time oh they say if your church has got that kind of atmosphere oh child if you want to live you better believe in the word so they so he said they cannot stay in that wrong atmosphere now there are and again you know we the thought comes along that preachers who don't want the atmosphere were the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes they claim they have that but they want more than that they're seeking the character of the key whatever that means well if you had the Holy Ghost then you would have the character of The King and without it you still have your old character of your carnal nature they said no you you've got to educate the people into having the character of the king you see you need counseling before marriage to give the young people character I don't know that all your teaching is going to give anybody character counseling and instructions has its place but educating them into it is not what they need if you want the character the king then you receive his life and that will give you his character amen now so so again that's how you get the character of the king you receive his life if you have his life well then it's going to produce the character of Christ it can't help but produce it listen a dog does not grow to be a human it grows up to be a dog because it's born with the characteristics of a dog in the nature of a dog it grows up to be adult if you're human you don't grow up to be a pig you might pig out it's supper but you're not a pig because you have the character of a human that you were born with that characteristics and when you're born of Christ these signs shall follow them that believe they cast out devils well brother Tim I never got down there and laid hands on somebody and cast The Devil out well what about the devil that come in your thinking that you cast out hey man what about that tormenting spirit that attacked your body and you said I don't have to have this I'm a blood-washing child of the Living God I speak against us in the name of Jesus Christ and I'm leaving that behind me come on somebody amen there's more casting out Devils than down here to altering the prayer line you know how to overcome depression by the temp cast him out [Applause] people want some kind of magic formula where you do this kind of like the man told Brother the school teacher no brother Branham okay you got a violent temper but before that you know you explode and get mad I want you to tie a hundred knots he didn't get very far into it away and went fighting that was his nature till it changed amen all the hundred knots in the world didn't keep him amen it was when the devil was cast out when he was saved that changed his nature now rather than hating the man wanting to kill and murder the guy that killed his dog he led him to Christ [Applause] you see it changes you it's the power of God and the salvation I know this is too simple but listen I asked more than just too simple it's actually magnificent think about it women it might have been simple thinking to Sarah oh that's too hard to believe that's stupid you know to believe in old women like me but when her nature was changed what if she was chasing the presence of that angel amen then her heart was turned and the Bible said that she received strength to be to conceive because she judged him faithful who made the promise [Applause] come on now it ain't you going to be able to defeat this devil it ain't you going to be able to defeat this habit but you judge that she is faithful Hallelujah to deliver me amen I will overcome this cause I got the Overcomer on the inside of me the seed where the Bible can't grow in such a word as that how can a person go into one of those modern churches now and the spirit of God come upon it and they want to holler glory to God hallelujah you know what while you make the preacher swallow his sermon well I'm telling you I can just say him oh brother that's only denomination oh no there have been there have been Godly men and women hauled out a message churches for breaking Church order for saying amen you know I made the preacher swallow his sermon brother they said I you know a guy asked brother Brandon how can you preach if they do that he said I I couldn't preach unless they did amen because they were producing the atmosphere they were encouraged in the Holy Spirit and pulling on the gift of God he said it was like the like his old hound dog he said he hated the skunk but he said you know and so what he did he got a skunk said he wouldn't go get him but he said if I'd hit him on the side and say second boy second boy he said I could encourage him to go into that old brush pile and drag that old skunk out and he said the biggest skunk I know is the devil and if I can get some people to Pat me on the side and say I'm sick of boy we'll go after that devil and bring that old speaker out of the dress pot and kill him foreign [Applause] and he said in all them cranes there stretch that neck around you know he said well who said that what was that in a few minutes preachers say Jesus Christ the son of God and they said glory to God that's right um they can see you're right at the door right in a few minutes they'll throw you right out the word can't grow there I'm quoting just can't do it just can't do it see it just simply can't and when he comes spraying this poison on top of it trying to kill the germ life in you now there's a group of people in the land today that believes that God heals well of course we're no reasonable sin shows that God gave us doctors to heal now and he said you asked a good sensible doctor if he's a Healer he'll tell you no I can move a tooth but I can't heal the socket it came out of that's right I can set an arm but I can't heal it that's certainly right God is the Healer now how's it ever going to grow it well something ever going to grow in such a stuff is that how can the seed word ever grow in such as that it just won't do it it just can't grow in that kind of atmosphere but Faith grows only grows in one vitamin it only has or needs one vitamin don't have to have any mixture at all Faith grows in one vitamin that's the word and that's the only thing that faith can grow in is the word and the way that it grows is to believe the word has take all the word believe it's true and Faith vitamin is spelled four little one a little four-letter word l-i-f-e life and it has vitamin L faith has vitamin l so he goes on and says he says then he said now everything that has been created was created by faith Hebrews 11 by faith the world was created the world was made by faith God's made the world out of things that does not appear by faith God spoke the world into existence because it was a premeditated word and as soon as he said it it became life now you say I believe that brother Branham in your heart you can't believe it then express it I believe it don't never change it at all stay right with it watch what will grow out of it it will produce the word cause it's Faith wisdom takes you away Faith brings you to it but you see what the world wants to do is to the systems of the world wants to take the word of God and make it traditional now brother Branham told us exactly what happens to prophets when they leave he said what they do he said God will anoint and use a man and he said then they will make a tradition out of his life and let me just tell you because they do that they become living in the Clara of the past and their God is past not present so it will be when something happens out here but it's not now and it all becomes pretentious and pretending rather than reality now let me just say brother Brandon said you can't put genuine corn in something unless it's Earth and it won't grow you can lay it in the sun you can keep it warm you can do what you want if it has to be it takes a certain kind of Earth it must be there it must be under the right atmosphere to make it bring forth and he says so does the word of God you can't take a church and bring it to life on some tradition you might bring members by the Millions but you'll never bring the power of God until we get back to the original word again back to the foundational word back to the blood back to Jesus Christ back to old-fashioned prayer meetings and back to God and that's what we've been seeing this old-fashioned prayer meetings where people meet God and because of him the atmosphere changes when a baby is born there's a little spirit with a living atmosphere that has comes to give life to that baby when he comes into a life then he becomes a live and breathing entity now brother Branham let's talk about this thing same thing and he talked about wanting to get his daughter Rebecca in meetings where the Holy Ghost was falling he said because it's the atmosphere that will make it happen amen and he said now before there's a birth there's got to be a death first you got to die to your sins die to your will die to your unbelief you know there's got to be a dying out that's one reason for an altar you come to that altar to die Jonathan Middleton sitting right here came to me as a young boy I don't know how many times I want to be delivered to these cigarettes I want to be delivered to these cigarettes we'd pray for him he'd come back from prayer I want to be delivered to the cigarettes one day he finally come to me and he was honest he said you know why I smoked these cigarettes I said no why because I love them I love these secrets I love how it makes me feel after a meal I love I just love these cigarettes I said well Jonathan you'll never be delivered to them cigarettes to you hate them I said look at what it's doing to you it's destroying your life destroying your lungs is keeping you in unbelief the boy can sing he wanted to sing I said no you can't sing in my church why can't I sing well I said okay let me smoke a cigarette and you listen to me preach well no I wouldn't want to hear you preach that's a smoke we cigarette I don't want to hear you sing what I want you to do is repent but it got the place that Jonathan come to the point he hated those cigarettes and when he hated those cigarettes and repented of them that God came and delivered him yeah let me pack a day cigarettes was that Jonathan it's about three packs of cigarettes a day you see it was an addiction you know what was an addiction it was a devil sitting right down here drawing through that amount of satisfaction amen and so you see when that devil was gone no no more cigarettes never bothered him again hallelujah amen so you see there had to be a dying out before the birds could come and a bird's is a mess we don't care where it's out if it's a big pen or a pig decorated the hospital room it's going to be a mess it'll make you do things you ordinarily wouldn't think you would do remember when you're ready to die to yourself and you're born again become a new creature in Christ Jesus and open up a light comes becomes a new sight to you because you've accepted the person of Jesus Christ not some Doctrine or Creed of I believe this or I believe the message I've accepted Jesus and my savior it's more than that but the person of Christ comes into you and you're born again I'd like to preach a whole sermon on this next phrase but not today even to the written word it's got to be quickened by the Holy Spirit you can memorize your Bible you can read it every day but it takes a quickening of that word to your heart amen he said I could have a handful of wheat but until he gets in the process to where it can be quickened the wheat will never lift said you can have a doctor's degree a pH LL whatever you wish to and people's got him in the message they've studied they have been there they're well studied but until the Holy Spirit comes upon that and quickens you as a personal experience with God then the wheat does no good your learning is in vain amen and then he said as the Englishman said the other night I was so astonished at that all the learning he had is Paul he had to forget all he knew in order to find Christ do things that he thought he wouldn't do and that's the way God does he humiliates us in our educational system not as I'm trying to support ignorance but I'm trying to tell you the difference education can never bring life understand this the word can be taught and they can receive it education but it will not bring life it takes the spirit of God to bring life and that life must not come out of just an intellectual Revival is going to come out of the Bible word Revival and that word is the same yesterday today and forever and when it falls today and quickens you get the same results as in Acts 2. exactly it always has and always will be because the spirit of God it's the spirit of God conditions the atmosphere so let's re-emphasize that a word Revival somebody say word Revival it brings the same results of Acts 2. oh brother Tim we are in the Revival now but it's not a holy ghost survival it's a word Revival well a word Revival will you get the same results as an Acts 2. so if the word is really preached it's going to bring forth Acts 2 again when the word is preached in his fullness there will be healing miracles the Holy Ghost true salvation the power of Christ it will be there so remember that's the only kind that the word can bring forth is that acts 2 38 blabber tongue-speaking baby come on somebody you are you say my brother Tim you see but we're wanting a mature church and you just call them babies listen it took a woman a mature woman with ripened Faith to bring forth that kind of baby [Music] Sarah could not do it before it took a ripened Faith a mature faith to bring forth that kind of job and if we got that kind of a church then you're going to have that kind of baby Isaacs Hallelujah those Supernatural Born Again black wasps young men young women filled with the Holy Ghost with the power of God that can believe for anything that all things are possible to them that believe an intellectual Revival brings a dead child that is just born out of dead teaching and mere theology a word Revival changes the life to the indwelling of Christ and the soul an intellectual Revival tries to bring Reformation so you see through educating the mind toward righteousness you know educating the Mind toward righteousness you know then but that's not what a word Revival is a word Revival is a transformation brother Brandon preached this the power to transform not the power to reform and this is where that we we got too much we got too much denominational teaching from the glare of the past age bringing an end to making a message intellectual rather than the power of God to Salvation that brings us Supernatural birth now Sarah heard the word she had heard Abraham said right now it had been 25 years from the first time Sarah heard the word and she had received the message intellectually can you bear with me a few more minutes you're not as hard as I am but she had heard the word she'd received the message intellectually but what did she do with it she reasoned it I'm not able to do this so she gives the seed over to a bonds woman and this is what has happened to the message the church has received the message intellectually and she acknowledges that the bride is chosen before the foundation world she accepts the fact that there is to be the Seed of Abraham in the last day but through her intellectual reasoning she gave the seed word over to the wombs of a bug's woman and it is given birth to Israelites a child of the Supernatural and Isaac will be gentle Meek obedient all the way to the altar sacrifice I heard some Pentecostal preacher here in town talk about Isaac 16 years old or so and he told him you know you're going to be the sacrifice and he said he had to chase him down before he got he had to wrestle him down and tie him up and drag him to the altar screaming you can just imagine they thought this was a great revelation this is what Isaac you know that's the way he pictured Isaac that was not Isaac you see Isaac went and when it come down to the point where he said God will provide for himself a sacrifice he'll provide a lamb somebody help me preach you know Isaac went right up listen Isaac was gentle he had the cross the pack of wood on his shoulder he knew what it was to go to church amen he knew what it was to participate in church okay amen you know you listen we trained our babies from the time they were like this sit up pay attention listen yeah sometimes they got tired and went to sleep but we didn't let them duddle all over and play games in church and play on papers and draw faces and do all that come on you teach them the worship I don't know I don't know sometimes what's wrong with your parents that you don't even know how to treat your children to worship when we're singing sing when they stand don't lay on the bench get up if you're clapping hands get your hands and clap them sing worship participate we're here to worship from the youngest to the oldest I've seen preachers kids are 14 years old lay down on the pier and go to sleep during church oh yeah I've seen it I've seen a lot in my 50-something years of preacher got a lot more years than that but you know there again Isaac was no wild man he was submissive to what the word said whatever the word says do I'll do it if I Gotta Die to be resurrected I'll die we talk a lot of times about Abraham's Faith Isaac had to have a lot of faith he had to believe that whatever was going to happen he was going to rise up again is that right but you see that's too many now listen that's why there's too many of the offsprings of today's message churches won't be subject to the word because they received the word through the womb of a bonds woman so The Offspring looks half Egyptian they go to message Church but Egyptians paint is on their face oh you forgot your Rotten Tomatoes today good thing there's some more there is Egyptian clothes that are designed by Egyptians and they're way too tight they got trimmed hair like the Egyptians do and there's even cross-dressing among men and women sissified and it produces ishmaelites people that you have to beg to come to church you have to drag them you don't always have to counsel them in their marriage because selfishness and pride is still there Unforgiven Spirits hate and grudges are still there they got Egyptian natures come on you see why because you're born of an intellectual womb by intellectual reasoning instead of being a child of the supernatural which makes a bunch of half a gyps and half breeds Street look at their night you know God bless you Sister Rachel she came from Tucson they love Mexican food she picks lots of Mexican food good food nothing wrong with that because she's a Westerner she comes over here she might feed you now I'm just making up stuff here she might feed you a taco for breakfast but it won't be a handmade rolling biscuit like here in the south and you know what she Jessica was raised in Mama's cooking she can cook good Mexican right and Joe has had to eat a lot of tacos for breakfast there ain't been no tomato gravy and homemade biscuits because he married a Westerner and more than likely the kids will be producing tacos and enchiladas and guacamole and all of that it'll pass right on down because Jerry married from Indiana married a Westerner now let me bring this around none of that was spiritual I'm just using it for example now I got your attention where are you going to go with this how are you going to fix this look at the date they love Egyptian food of television movies up all night gaming unbridled lust pornography because they're born of an Egyptian womb though they called herself Abraham's seed message I'm born again I'm the Seed of Abraham I cut my teeth on the message Pew I believe the message I've accepted but yeah that's true but you were born of an Egyptian womb because you were born just like the denominates of birth children by education and an intellectual Revival I'm brother Tim you just called a bunch ishmaelites you know the good thing about it the difference is between you and Ishmael are you in Judas are you in Cain is you can't be born again and you can be born of the womb of the supernatural Hallelujah God by the power of the Holy Ghost at Birth you a gentle Isaac hallelujah amen where and when the message is preached intellectually there are no Miracles there are no gifts of the Spirit and the Supernatural is absent and Sarah's atmosphere had to be changed back to Acts 2 again in order to bring forth Children of the word and the only kind the word can bring forth are Acts 2 tongue-speaking blabber and scream them shouting youngins let me read it again and I'm in overtime I'm closing down soon and I'll let you know how soon navigation can never bring life it takes the spirit of God to bring life and life cannot come out of just the intellectual Revival it's got to come out of the Bible word Revival and the word is the same yesterday today and forever and when it falls today and quickens you get the same results that you did in Acts 2. so now you can tell if the word is being preached by the results [Applause] if the word is preached the results will be Acts 2 again amen what was happening with Acts 2 Church come on now you know what Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give unity in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk that book of Acts people had something to give not like a lot of bankrupt churches today it takes atmosphere so that's why your men are taught to bring your children here he said I want my daughter Rebecca to come in and sit down he said you saw me weak in a woman it was my daughter and she come in and sat down I want her to receive the baptism of the spirit and that's why she's here in the meeting that's the purpose of it it takes atmosphere Dr Bosworth said you can take a hit in the egg and put it under a pup it will hatch a chicken because it's an egg and it's got the right atmosphere I don't care if your Methodist Baptist present here in the right atmosphere the bats out a brand new child of God claim the word it's the atmosphere that does it no matter what the denominational tag you got foreign as he said when a church or any group of people assumed together and pray until they throw away their Creeds and things and look straight in the face of God and bring forth the Eagles as soon as I'm standing here he goes on to say let us break up the atmosphere let's get in the atmosphere in a Heavenly worship get the atmospheres Eagles was born he said you know John said if God said he said we were attributes to begin with God said in this day back in the beginning John Doe will be my servant millions of years ago now John Doe is born in sin Sip and liquidy come the world speaking lies because he's Immortal maybe he gets very little religious feelings he'll go to church maybe he'll join the Pentecostal Church don't know he might join anything but let him get under the atmosphere of God once and John Doe is bound to recognize who his father is just as that eagle recognized who his mother was it's got to realize all that John Doe is God's attribute that's become a word spoken and the Holy Spirit seeks that word out Hallelujah that's why we got to be in the right atmosphere our faith has got to be ripened from intellectual receiving the message to our faith is ripened to believe all the word of God amen will you stand with me this morning thank you for bearing with me thank you for loving me thank you of you flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me [Music] in this kind of atmosphere anything can happen [Music] because it's more than an intellectual gospel it's the power of Christ and
