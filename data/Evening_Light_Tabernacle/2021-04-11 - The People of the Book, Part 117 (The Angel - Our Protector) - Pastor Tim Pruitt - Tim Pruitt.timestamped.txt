[57:52] and he is he can be everywhere in the
[57:55] world you
[57:56] invite him to your church he'll be sure
[57:59] to show up because he keeps all of his
[58:01] appointments
[58:02] amen we heard some wonderful wonderful
[58:04] messages
[58:06] while that we were here we heard from
[58:09] of course our brother danny steeman and
[58:12] um
[58:13] he preached um a couple of wonderful
[58:15] messages there on
[58:17] dangerous and then of course the
[58:20] the last one was finishers amen he had
[58:24] he had them little catchy one-line
[58:27] titles but
[58:28] our one word titles and they were but it
[58:30] was wonderful
[58:31] messages that was behind those one words
[58:35] and we were so blessed by it and of
[58:37] course then we
[58:38] we heard a sermon that said from brother
[58:41] andrew spencer there ain't no grave
[58:43] going to hold my body down
[58:46] amen and we were so encouraged and
[58:48] blessed by that and
[58:50] lifted up amen and then we then we heard
[58:54] um from brother ron that same
[58:57] evening brother ron spencer morning is
[59:00] coming
[59:02] we believe that don't we amen we've
[59:05] already heard
[59:06] the prophet of god come out and say
[59:08] shalom
[59:10] amen it means the night is about over
[59:13] and now the morning star as it were that
[59:16] heralds the
[59:17] the coming of this son which is christ
[59:20] he's
[59:20] already went off the scene and is the
[59:23] the last
[59:24] messenger as it was i'm just typing
[59:27] there
[59:27] not necessarily meaning that it's exact
[59:30] but just
[59:31] just using it as a type for now that
[59:35] you know he's already moved off the
[59:37] scene and now
[59:38] the light is about to diffuse all
[59:41] the darkness amen as we move
[59:44] from glory and to glory
[59:47] and then we um then we of course it was
[59:50] finished up with brother
[59:52] danny steeman preaching on finishers i
[59:55] thought it was really
[59:57] neat brother kaelin singh from south
[1:00:00] africa a fellow minister pastor there
[1:00:02] he just kind of summed it up like this
[1:00:05] and he said
[1:00:07] he said this outpouring
[1:00:10] is dangerous for the devil knows
[1:00:14] ain't no grave going to hold the body
[1:00:17] down
[1:00:18] because morning is coming and the
[1:00:21] finishers are on the scene
[1:00:26] god bless you brother caitlin and the
[1:00:28] saints there and
[1:00:30] all of you there that are that catch our
[1:00:33] services
[1:00:34] they've been had their church they're
[1:00:36] not missing their church they don't have
[1:00:37] their church but they're just joining in
[1:00:39] with us
[1:00:40] and we're happy to have them with us as
[1:00:43] i as i said
[1:00:44] you know that that um the
[1:00:48] the um the revival that we are
[1:00:51] experiencing
[1:00:52] is not something that belongs to evening
[1:00:55] like tabernacle or is exclusive here
[1:00:58] but that revival lies in the promised
[1:01:00] land
[1:01:01] of the word of god and anywhere the word
[1:01:03] is preached
[1:01:05] you can have revival with signs and
[1:01:07] wonders and
[1:01:08] miracles and every other promise of god
[1:01:12] and my vision of course is that there
[1:01:14] would be a bride around the world
[1:01:16] i believe that that's the prophet's
[1:01:18] vision because he saw her from ever
[1:01:20] kindred tongue tribe and people
[1:01:22] and um you know we're here to help and
[1:01:25] assist
[1:01:26] but uh we're we're not here to to take
[1:01:29] the place of
[1:01:30] other pastors or ministries we're here
[1:01:33] just to
[1:01:34] edify the body of christ and and uh
[1:01:37] so we're we're trusting that that uh
[1:01:40] everybody can see that the move is on
[1:01:42] for the bride
[1:01:43] for that's thus saith the lord amen and
[1:01:46] that bride is around the world and
[1:01:49] you know this is not about building up a
[1:01:51] few mega churches or
[1:01:53] men's kingdoms kingdom building days are
[1:01:56] over with
[1:01:57] the rapture is at hand let me just
[1:02:00] encourage everybody today that the word
[1:02:02] is yours
[1:02:03] and it's in your grasp as a prophet of
[1:02:06] god that declared and
[1:02:08] i was there when he said it don't
[1:02:09] particularly remember it but i was there
[1:02:11] i got it from the tape later the move is
[1:02:14] on for the bride
[1:02:15] that's thus saith the lord and it hadn't
[1:02:19] stopped
[1:02:21] and the devil isn't big enough to stop
[1:02:23] it
[1:02:24] i hear brother branham saying in the
[1:02:26] deceived church by the world he said so
[1:02:28] revival in our day
[1:02:30] how can we have it when the revival
[1:02:32] regular revival
[1:02:33] giver is bound by the world god won't
[1:02:36] come in where the world is you can just
[1:02:38] depend on that you associate with the
[1:02:40] world
[1:02:40] then it's all of it when you let the
[1:02:42] world creep in you go to acting like the
[1:02:44] world then you're
[1:02:45] finished but when you cut loose ever
[1:02:47] fatter from the world and come to god
[1:02:50] and god will use you until you go to
[1:02:53] flirting again
[1:02:54] and here's the only hope that i have
[1:02:57] this morning to wind this my message up
[1:03:00] is this while samson was
[1:03:02] bound a new shock of hair growed out
[1:03:05] and he says then god sent us another
[1:03:08] church
[1:03:09] before the end time with the power of
[1:03:11] the holy spirit
[1:03:13] can come into it and to her in the
[1:03:15] demonstrations
[1:03:17] of the spirit and mark 16 can follow the
[1:03:20] church acts 2 4 acts 2 38
[1:03:22] all of it will be followed right along
[1:03:24] with the church signs and wonders
[1:03:26] accompanying the apostles great signs of
[1:03:29] his resurrection
[1:03:30] accompany them while we're in prison
[1:03:33] surely
[1:03:33] god's growing a crop somewhere for the
[1:03:36] last great keel
[1:03:37] and and so again as we look at this this
[1:03:41] is
[1:03:42] brother branham's desire to see that
[1:03:44] revival
[1:03:45] around the world and that is our
[1:03:48] desire i want to just say again how much
[1:03:51] that we appreciate you and what you have
[1:03:54] done
[1:03:55] and uh you know every effort i
[1:03:58] got compliments on how well the services
[1:04:01] were conducted the altar calls
[1:04:03] the uh deacons and the assistance from
[1:04:06] them and
[1:04:07] uh the food that was prepared
[1:04:10] after service that where you send them
[1:04:13] home with their sack lunches and
[1:04:15] many other kept people in their homes
[1:04:18] and
[1:04:18] was so accommodating to those to give
[1:04:21] them a place to stay
[1:04:23] and and then um others who couldn't take
[1:04:26] people
[1:04:27] in they cooked good meals and brought
[1:04:29] them well to my house and to some others
[1:04:31] i know
[1:04:32] and really blessed um many of them that
[1:04:35] stayed and and it was a special help to
[1:04:38] me and sister karen sister karen has
[1:04:41] been so blessed to return to health
[1:04:44] and she can do the cooking around home
[1:04:47] and
[1:04:47] she made me my breakfast this morning as
[1:04:49] she does now all the time and
[1:04:52] many of the meals during the day but um
[1:04:55] that that little special help when you
[1:04:58] had
[1:04:58] a lot of guests we had three preachers
[1:05:00] and their wives and
[1:05:01] others in our home that was um with us
[1:05:05] so
[1:05:05] you know you you blessed us in a great
[1:05:07] way and
[1:05:08] and lightened our burden and i want to
[1:05:11] say thank you very much
[1:05:13] and god bless you let's give you a hand
[1:05:16] of applause this morning amen we
[1:05:19] appreciate you very much
[1:05:23] hallelujah thank you jesus

[1:05:31] amen now as i've shared those
[1:05:35] moments why don't we stand and let's um
[1:05:39] just go to the lord and as we as we read
[1:05:42] the word we're going to go to exodus
[1:05:44] chapter 23
[1:05:46] and we're going to verse 20. exodus
[1:05:50] chapter 23 and verse 20.
[1:05:53] behold i send an angel before thee to
[1:05:56] keep thee
[1:05:57] in the way to bring thee into the place
[1:06:00] which i have prepared beware of him
[1:06:04] and obey his voice provoke him not for
[1:06:07] he will not
[1:06:07] pardon your transgressions
[1:06:11] for my name is in him
[1:06:15] but if thou shalt indeed obey his
[1:06:18] voice and provoke him not for he will
[1:06:21] not pardon your transgressions
[1:06:24] for my uh for my name is in him verse 22
[1:06:28] now but if thou will
[1:06:29] indeed obey his voice and do all that i
[1:06:32] speak then i will be an enemy unto thine
[1:06:34] enemies
[1:06:35] and an adversary unto thy adversaries
[1:06:38] for mine angels shall go before thee and
[1:06:41] bring thee
[1:06:42] unto the amorites the hittites and the
[1:06:45] perizzites and the canaanites
[1:06:47] and the highvites and the jebusites and
[1:06:50] i will cut them off
[1:06:51] thou shalt not bow down to their gods
[1:06:53] now nor
[1:06:54] serve them nor do after their works but
[1:06:57] thou
[1:06:58] shalt utterly overthrow them and quite
[1:07:00] break down their images
[1:07:02] and ye shall serve the lord your god and
[1:07:04] he shall bless thy bread
[1:07:06] and thy water and i will take sickness
[1:07:09] away from the midst of thee
[1:07:11] there shall nothing cast their young
[1:07:14] nor be barren in thy land the number of
[1:07:17] days
[1:07:18] thy days i will fulfill i will send my
[1:07:21] fear
[1:07:21] before thee and will destroy all the
[1:07:24] people to whom thou shalt come
[1:07:27] and i will make all thine enemies turn
[1:07:29] their
[1:07:30] backs unto before thee unto thee and i
[1:07:33] will send hornets before thee
[1:07:35] which shall drive out the highlight the
[1:07:37] canaanite the high tide
[1:07:39] and are hittite and from before thee i
[1:07:42] will not drive them out
[1:07:43] from before thee in one year lest the
[1:07:46] land become
[1:07:47] desolate and the beasts of the field
[1:07:49] multiply against thee
[1:07:51] by little and little i will drive them
[1:07:55] out
[1:07:55] from before thee until thou be increased
[1:07:58] and inherit the land and i will set thy
[1:08:02] bounds from the red
[1:08:03] sea even unto the sea of the philistines
[1:08:06] from the desert unto the river i will
[1:08:09] deliver the
[1:08:10] inhabitants of the land into your hand
[1:08:13] thou shalt drive them out before thee
[1:08:15] thou shalt make no covenant with them
[1:08:18] nor with their gods
[1:08:19] thou shalt not dwell in thy they shall
[1:08:22] not dwell in thy land
[1:08:23] lest they make thee sin against me for
[1:08:26] if thou serve their god
[1:08:28] it will surely be a snare unto thee
[1:08:31] amen may god bless his word today and
[1:08:34] just make it that word real to your
[1:08:36] heart amen
[1:08:38] is so important that we we believe and
[1:08:41] we receive the word of god
[1:08:43] amen now we're going to be speaking on
[1:08:46] today
[1:08:47] as we have been on the subject it's a
[1:08:49] very broad subject
[1:08:50] and actually i went through
[1:08:54] literally thousands of quotes studying
[1:08:56] them one at a time
[1:08:57] and categorizing them and making them
[1:09:00] into different topics
[1:09:01] on the angel of the lord and angel of
[1:09:04] the covenant
[1:09:08] so this morning we're going to be
[1:09:09] speaking on the angel our
[1:09:12] protector if you noticed in this
[1:09:15] passage of scripture that he read he
[1:09:17] said i will be
[1:09:18] an adversary to thy adversary and an
[1:09:21] enemy unto thy enemy now israel
[1:09:25] in the first exodus left egypt
[1:09:28] and they were led by the angel of the
[1:09:31] covenant
[1:09:32] who guarded and protected them all the
[1:09:34] way from egypt
[1:09:36] to the promised land i'd like to read
[1:09:39] from
[1:09:39] exodus chapter 14 and verse one you can
[1:09:42] read this chapter
[1:09:43] later because it contains a lot of what
[1:09:46] we're going to be speaking on this
[1:09:47] morning 14 and 15 as well
[1:09:50] and it says in the lord speaking to
[1:09:52] moses saying speaking to the children of
[1:09:54] israel
[1:09:55] that they turn and then camp before
[1:09:58] roth between middah and the sea
[1:10:02] over against baal zephan there before
[1:10:05] it it shall encamp by the sea
[1:10:10] for pharaoh will save the children of
[1:10:12] israel they are entangled in the land
[1:10:15] the wilderness has shut them in and i
[1:10:18] will harden the heart
[1:10:20] the pharaoh's heart and he shall follow
[1:10:23] after them
[1:10:24] and i will be honored upon pharaoh and
[1:10:27] upon all his hosts
[1:10:29] that the egyptians may know that i
[1:10:32] am the lord and they did so
[1:10:36] now it was in the midst of a great
[1:10:39] victory
[1:10:40] that god's people had been literally
[1:10:44] thrust out of
[1:10:45] egypt for pharaoh had said get out
[1:10:48] go and worship your god you know leave
[1:10:51] my land and go worship
[1:10:53] and and of course israel had been down
[1:10:57] in egypt now
[1:10:58] for 400 years and they were there
[1:11:01] because of the jealousy toward
[1:11:03] a brother jealousy is an awful thing
[1:11:07] amen and and you know it causes a lot of
[1:11:10] different things it causes
[1:11:12] um hatred and and and
[1:11:15] covetousness it causes possessiveness
[1:11:18] and control and and all of those things
[1:11:21] it can
[1:11:22] it can destroy a home it can destroy a
[1:11:25] life it can destroy a marriage
[1:11:27] and but but however in this case he was
[1:11:31] destroying
[1:11:32] a family it was separating brothers
[1:11:36] um it would cause them to do murderous
[1:11:38] acts because of that where they would
[1:11:41] turn on
[1:11:42] one of their own and actually going to
[1:11:45] kill him and then would
[1:11:46] sell him as a slave and they and
[1:11:49] it was all because that joseph was a
[1:11:53] spiritual boy who had dreams and visions
[1:11:56] from god
[1:11:57] actually god would use joseph to
[1:11:59] foretell or prophesy
[1:12:01] of the coming messiah who would
[1:12:05] would also be loved of his father i'm
[1:12:07] speaking of jesus
[1:12:08] now but he would be hated of his
[1:12:10] brethren because
[1:12:11] of jealousy he would be rejected and
[1:12:14] crucified
[1:12:15] as i said you know jealousy can cause
[1:12:19] awful things even jealousies within
[1:12:22] churches jealousies and ministries we
[1:12:25] just stop and realize
[1:12:27] as john the baptist said when when they
[1:12:29] come and told him
[1:12:30] the disciples of jesus are is baptizing
[1:12:33] more than you and
[1:12:34] all the people are gathered to him and
[1:12:36] they've left you and he says
[1:12:38] no man can make of himself anything it's
[1:12:41] god that gives him positions and places
[1:12:44] if we could just only realize that even
[1:12:47] as
[1:12:47] ministries even as churches there would
[1:12:49] be no need for the turf wars and the
[1:12:52] fights and the feuds that goes on
[1:12:54] but nevertheless um they the
[1:12:58] the children of israel were now in
[1:13:01] bondage down into egypt
[1:13:03] though because of the brother's jealousy
[1:13:07] joseph was rejected because he was
[1:13:10] spiritual
[1:13:11] and he was hated without a cause and
[1:13:14] they should not have hated him they
[1:13:16] should have loved him and respected him
[1:13:18] but instead they were jealous of him and
[1:13:22] god
[1:13:23] it's true god dealt with him more than
[1:13:25] the wrath gifts and callings are
[1:13:28] without repentance they are something
[1:13:30] that god puts upon a life that you have
[1:13:32] as brother branham said it's a divine
[1:13:34] gift that i had nothing to do with it
[1:13:36] coming
[1:13:38] and and it's true with any other gift
[1:13:40] you really can't make yourself something
[1:13:42] that you're not
[1:13:44] you know you you have to be given the
[1:13:46] gift to be placed
[1:13:48] in your life and call of god and ordain
[1:13:50] for that position in place
[1:13:53] but of course um god gave him spiritual
[1:13:56] understanding and dreams and
[1:13:58] interpretations and
[1:13:59] he he could foretell things that would
[1:14:01] come to pass
[1:14:03] now you would think this would cause his
[1:14:05] brothers to admire him
[1:14:07] and love him but this provoked them to
[1:14:10] jealousy
[1:14:11] you know they call him names like your
[1:14:14] little holy roller or
[1:14:15] you think we're going to bow down to you
[1:14:17] one day when they heard of his dreams
[1:14:19] and visions and
[1:14:20] you know the these older brothers who
[1:14:23] were
[1:14:23] so great in their own sight they thought
[1:14:26] they would
[1:14:27] never ever have to bow down to this man
[1:14:30] you know but they did they sure did they
[1:14:32] pleaded for mercy even because
[1:14:34] but at this moment in time when we were
[1:14:36] talking about when they sold him down
[1:14:38] into egypt
[1:14:39] well he he hadn't come into power yet
[1:14:42] you see he was only just in the child
[1:14:45] form
[1:14:46] but you know let me just say prophecies
[1:14:50] grow up
[1:14:51] and when children grow up and a lot of
[1:14:54] times what you see
[1:14:56] even in a young ministry don't judge it
[1:14:58] too hard
[1:14:59] it'll grow up you know let god determine
[1:15:02] let god decide
[1:15:04] let god do the calling let god do
[1:15:07] the setting down because god raises up
[1:15:10] man
[1:15:10] and god sets men down there's a time
[1:15:13] that he will use them for his bride and
[1:15:15] then he will move them off the scene
[1:15:18] but it's not that god is through with
[1:15:20] his pride he's through using that
[1:15:22] ministry
[1:15:23] he wants that certain ministry there in
[1:15:26] that bride and
[1:15:27] working on her first season and helping
[1:15:30] her first season but he'll move him off
[1:15:31] the scene because he got
[1:15:33] somebody else that's going to move right
[1:15:35] into that position
[1:15:37] and so you know the jealousies of the
[1:15:40] brothers though
[1:15:41] caused them to all end up down in egypt
[1:15:45] now i just say to the brothers across
[1:15:48] the world today
[1:15:49] those that might be listening in or hear
[1:15:51] another time or
[1:15:53] you know you look on and perhaps you
[1:15:55] know you there's a little criticism
[1:15:58] because of our worship and our
[1:16:00] expression and
[1:16:01] you know you hear slander words try to
[1:16:04] slander you
[1:16:05] by calling you a pentecostal or holy
[1:16:08] roller they would in days gone by or
[1:16:11] all kinds of names that they try to make
[1:16:13] that
[1:16:14] a bad name and but i'll tell you
[1:16:17] it's not a bad name
[1:16:20] my my forefathers were pentecostals oh
[1:16:23] well i knew that about you brother tim i
[1:16:25] knew you come from a bunch of
[1:16:27] pentecostals yes i did
[1:16:28] i came from peter and james and john and
[1:16:32] paul
[1:16:33] amen i came from the upper room
[1:16:36] and that's where that might go back to
[1:16:38] in my ancestry
[1:16:41] amen because i came from there and i
[1:16:43] can't help it
[1:16:45] amen i can't help having the joy that's
[1:16:47] in my heart
[1:16:48] i can't help having the holy ghost move
[1:16:51] over me
[1:16:52] and it just breaks out in another
[1:16:55] language sometimes
[1:16:56] i can't help it amen because that's who
[1:17:00] i
[1:17:01] am so if you say well you're just
[1:17:03] pentecostal okay
[1:17:05] i'm just pentecostal not azusa street
[1:17:08] although there were some of my brothers
[1:17:10] in azusa street
[1:17:11] men like john g lake and men like ff
[1:17:14] bosworth and men
[1:17:16] uh men you know that would stand
[1:17:19] in their time in their dispensation
[1:17:22] there's also methodists in my background
[1:17:24] there's a john wesley and george
[1:17:26] whitefield and
[1:17:27] many many other men of god there's also
[1:17:30] lutheran
[1:17:31] in my background there was a a man by
[1:17:33] the name
[1:17:34] one of my kin folks is martin luther
[1:17:38] who said who broke the yoke of the
[1:17:40] catholic church and said
[1:17:41] the just shall live by faith amen
[1:17:45] but but brothers why get jealous you
[1:17:48] know you can have it too
[1:17:50] you know unlike unlike um joseph's
[1:17:53] brother
[1:17:54] they couldn't be born again they could
[1:17:56] only have a natural birth
[1:17:58] they could only have that naturally but
[1:18:01] you can have a supernatural birth that
[1:18:04] will bring back
[1:18:05] signs and wonders that it will get you
[1:18:08] away from your
[1:18:09] dried-eyed confessions your easy
[1:18:11] believism your
[1:18:12] shallow experience of just saying i
[1:18:15] believe the message therefore i got the
[1:18:17] holy ghost
[1:18:18] but you see men get dirty filthy jealous
[1:18:21] when they see god blessing the true
[1:18:25] bride with signs and wonders and
[1:18:27] miracles
[1:18:28] and when they see god vindicating
[1:18:30] himself
[1:18:31] watching god heal the sick and casting
[1:18:34] out devils and
[1:18:35] speaking with tongues and interpreting
[1:18:38] tongues
[1:18:39] are you with me prophesied and all the
[1:18:42] other gifts of the spirit
[1:18:43] gifts of healing and workings of
[1:18:45] miracles
[1:18:47] but they got to find some way to to
[1:18:50] because of the jealousy to stone them
[1:18:53] so they're going to try to find quotes
[1:18:55] that they can use as stones
[1:18:57] to kill the move of god this is no
[1:18:59] different than they did
[1:19:00] in ages gone by they did this to the
[1:19:03] pentecostal
[1:19:04] the azusa street they did this to to the
[1:19:07] ones there the methodists when they
[1:19:09] shouted
[1:19:09] they did this to martin luther they did
[1:19:12] this to our
[1:19:13] our forefathers abraham abraham isaac
[1:19:16] and jacob
[1:19:17] and all that claim to know the one true
[1:19:19] and living god
[1:19:20] amen they cast their stones they with
[1:19:22] their intellectual mind
[1:19:24] believe that they are more able to set a
[1:19:27] church in order
[1:19:28] better than what the holy spirit can do
[1:19:30] it
[1:19:31] amen yeah and i'm no church order
[1:19:34] don't think i don't i understand i've
[1:19:37] read it i've listened to it we adhere to
[1:19:40] it
[1:19:41] did you hear it what we have in this
[1:19:43] church is true church order
[1:19:46] amen and i know that things should be
[1:19:48] done decently
[1:19:49] in order but as brother branham said of
[1:19:52] the woman who washed jesus feet
[1:19:55] said she elbowed right through there she
[1:19:57] was going to get there
[1:19:58] regardless of how vowed she was oh
[1:20:02] i know it was out of order oh sure god
[1:20:05] help us to get out of here once in a
[1:20:07] while
[1:20:08] the trouble of it is you got too much
[1:20:10] order get out order i hope the church
[1:20:13] gets out of order long enough to get
[1:20:15] saved
[1:20:17] amen that's what we're trying to do
[1:20:19] we're trying to get out of order
[1:20:21] long enough for people to get saved
[1:20:24] [Applause]
[1:20:25] hallelujah i remember when jesus saved
[1:20:28] me he said oh my i'll never forget it
[1:20:30] this
[1:20:31] little kentucky heart of mine was
[1:20:33] jumping 90 miles an hour
[1:20:36] and i wept and i cried and i shouted i
[1:20:39] didn't care who was standing around
[1:20:41] i wasn't paying attention to order i was
[1:20:44] in the presence of jesus
[1:20:46] and i loved him she wasn't noticing how
[1:20:49] much order she was in
[1:20:51] or how much she was out of the main
[1:20:53] thing was
[1:20:54] get to jesus there he sat with dirty
[1:20:57] feet
[1:20:58] he set without being kissed he wasn't
[1:21:01] welcome and she wanted to make him
[1:21:03] welcome
[1:21:03] she didn't care about their old
[1:21:05] pharisaic order or their old traditions
[1:21:08] or denominations she was pressing
[1:21:10] her way through to jesus god help us to
[1:21:13] have a revival like that
[1:21:15] where men and women will allow their
[1:21:17] their where men and women will elbow
[1:21:19] their way through the crowds and the
[1:21:21] denominations and the barriers
[1:21:23] to the kid in the presence of jesus i
[1:21:26] don't want to be that way this morning
[1:21:28] amen that there will be desperate souls
[1:21:31] that are just elbow their way through
[1:21:32] the crowd
[1:21:33] through the criticism through the
[1:21:35] unbelief through the darkness
[1:21:37] amen and get to jesus whatever you got
[1:21:39] to do just get to jesus
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:45] now this of course caused
[1:21:48] the nation of israel to eventually go
[1:21:51] down to egypt
[1:21:52] where they became bondaged and then
[1:21:55] slavery
[1:21:57] and after joseph's death they settled
[1:21:59] down to egyptian ways
[1:22:03] and soon egyptian gods were thought more
[1:22:07] powerful than jehovah
[1:22:11] and as brother branham said and you can
[1:22:13] take a lot of things that i've already
[1:22:15] said this morning
[1:22:16] which i didn't quote from i mean i only
[1:22:18] quoted by memory from there
[1:22:20] but but they're from the third exodus
[1:22:22] where he says and where he
[1:22:24] continues on this same thought of how
[1:22:27] they got down into egypt
[1:22:29] they said we don't need the holy spirit
[1:22:31] to heal the sick
[1:22:32] we got doctors we don't need the holy
[1:22:35] spirit to speak with tongues
[1:22:37] we're all intelligent people and when
[1:22:40] you do you take
[1:22:40] right from your framework the lifeline
[1:22:44] jesus said them jews in this day haven't
[1:22:46] you read that the stone that was
[1:22:48] rejected
[1:22:49] is a chief cornerstone that all the
[1:22:51] building is setting upon
[1:22:53] now you see what i mean i'm sure you can
[1:22:55] catch that that's the reason of now
[1:22:57] they thought they would never have need
[1:22:59] of it
[1:23:00] we don't need speakers with tongues
[1:23:03] we don't need interpreters of tongues
[1:23:06] we know we no longer need the old
[1:23:09] testament prophets to set us in order by
[1:23:11] the holy spirit
[1:23:12] we understand it and they've adopted
[1:23:14] man-made systems
[1:23:16] to take the place of the holy spirit
[1:23:19] think about that
[1:23:20] this is a condition this is what takes a
[1:23:24] people a movement
[1:23:25] down to egypt to where they come to
[1:23:28] place we don't need
[1:23:29] speakers with tongues we don't need
[1:23:32] interpretation we're intelligent
[1:23:34] people now so he said therefore
[1:23:38] there's a people that's elected that's
[1:23:41] got their names on the lamb's book of
[1:23:43] life
[1:23:44] they can't go for that they are
[1:23:47] spiritual minded and therefore they
[1:23:49] can't
[1:23:49] go for that they can't stand it no
[1:23:52] matter if their fathers and mothers was
[1:23:54] lived in whatever
[1:23:55] organizational church maybe it wouldn't
[1:23:57] speak right out oh no they won't speak
[1:23:59] it right out
[1:24:00] but their actions prove it here is the
[1:24:03] word and the holy spirit speak it proves
[1:24:05] it's among those
[1:24:06] when he gets them gathered together that
[1:24:08] he still heals the sick
[1:24:10] and raises the dead and speaks with
[1:24:12] tongues
[1:24:13] and casts out devil so it depends on
[1:24:16] what's on the inside of a person
[1:24:20] the church feels they don't need the
[1:24:21] holy spirit the churches to tell you
[1:24:23] that and men can
[1:24:24] get up and give such an intellectual
[1:24:27] talk
[1:24:27] they can also also make you almost make
[1:24:31] you believe it
[1:24:33] now notice intellectual talks so smooth
[1:24:36] that it would deceive the people it's
[1:24:38] the gospel it's gospel it's men
[1:24:41] who can handle the word in such a way
[1:24:43] that he
[1:24:44] could almost take any intellectual
[1:24:46] person if you're just
[1:24:47] trusting in alex that would condemn the
[1:24:50] holy spirit and take that
[1:24:51] the way of man so you see
[1:24:55] they but there came a time that israel
[1:24:58] had to leave egypt
[1:25:01] they had to get out of that group of
[1:25:04] rejecters
[1:25:05] over into the promise before the messiah
[1:25:08] could ever manifest himself to him
[1:25:11] you see jesus had to come and there had
[1:25:14] to be a people there
[1:25:16] in that land to receive him when he come
[1:25:19] so they had to get out of that group of
[1:25:21] rejecters
[1:25:22] to get over into the promised land to
[1:25:25] get ready
[1:25:26] for the messiah to come isn't that what
[1:25:28] we got to do
[1:25:29] we got to leave the rejecters come on
[1:25:32] get back in the land of the bible
[1:25:35] amen get out of it get in the land of
[1:25:38] the bible
[1:25:38] are you with me now so the messiah can
[1:25:41] come
[1:25:42] because we are not typing anymore we are
[1:25:45] the anatype of all the types we are the
[1:25:48] fulfillment of all scripture
[1:25:54] he said a man he said
[1:25:58] he said a man a woman marry a man
[1:26:01] disagreeing with him it'd be some kind
[1:26:02] of fuss continually
[1:26:04] but when a man and his wife his
[1:26:06] girlfriend is a spouse
[1:26:08] when they are in perfect harmony like
[1:26:10] one soul and one mind because they're
[1:26:12] going to be one flesh
[1:26:13] then when the church can get such
[1:26:15] harmony with god
[1:26:17] until the manifestation of the
[1:26:18] bridegroom is manifested in the bride
[1:26:20] because they're going to be one
[1:26:24] hallelujah now you have to leave the
[1:26:27] land of boston physicians
[1:26:29] to be with the great physician you have
[1:26:32] to leave that bunch of people that
[1:26:34] believes the days of miracles are passed
[1:26:36] to be with people that believes that all
[1:26:39] things are possible
[1:26:40] to them that believe you have to leave
[1:26:43] egypt's bondage were
[1:26:44] were they had no signs to follow a
[1:26:47] pillar fire
[1:26:48] and a cloud you have to leave the muddy
[1:26:52] waters
[1:26:52] of the egyptian mile to drink from the
[1:26:55] fountain
[1:26:56] of living waters of the holy ghost that
[1:26:59] something that never runs dry you have
[1:27:02] to leave the leeks and the garlics of
[1:27:04] egypt to eat angels food from out of
[1:27:06] heaven
[1:27:07] are you with me amen so you we of
[1:27:11] us of us are special people who have
[1:27:14] been particularly
[1:27:15] called in this day that said come out of
[1:27:17] her my people
[1:27:19] come out of traditions come out of dead
[1:27:22] churches
[1:27:23] come out of the world get into christ
[1:27:27] get into the bible get in the promised
[1:27:29] land of the word of god
[1:27:31] we have been called for that purpose
[1:27:34] amen that's what this message calls us
[1:27:36] to
[1:27:37] now you wonder why hasn't there been a
[1:27:41] return before there's been 2 000 years
[1:27:43] of christianity there's been a lot of
[1:27:47] labor in the gospel a lot of
[1:27:48] denominations now
[1:27:52] a lot of books a lot of creeds a lot of
[1:27:54] different ideas
[1:27:56] how come why hasn't there been a return
[1:27:58] to the promised land of the bible until
[1:28:01] now
[1:28:03] genesis 15 16 tells us
[1:28:06] that he tell god tells abraham i can't
[1:28:09] give you this land now
[1:28:11] but in the fourth generation they shall
[1:28:13] come hither again
[1:28:14] for the iniquity of the amorites is not
[1:28:17] yet full
[1:28:19] now bear with me for a moment we have
[1:28:21] had great revivals
[1:28:23] of the past there's been the baptists
[1:28:26] the lutherans the methodists
[1:28:28] the nazarenes the pilgrim holiness and
[1:28:30] the pentecostals
[1:28:32] just to name a few of them the main ones
[1:28:34] and each
[1:28:35] have had their chance at the word the
[1:28:38] baptist would restore
[1:28:39] immersion the lutherans would restore
[1:28:42] justification by faith
[1:28:45] the methodists would would bring
[1:28:47] sanctification
[1:28:49] the nazarene shouting and the pilgrimage
[1:28:52] as holiness
[1:28:53] and the pentecostals the gifts of the
[1:28:55] spirit there have been great
[1:28:57] revivals of the past great moves of god
[1:29:01] and each one of them believed that this
[1:29:03] is the day
[1:29:05] this is the hour this is the time but
[1:29:07] they ran into roadblocks
[1:29:10] you know why because the iniquity of the
[1:29:12] amorites were not yet
[1:29:13] fulfilled and but god gives
[1:29:16] nations opportunities to repent before
[1:29:20] judgment
[1:29:21] the amorite nation had plenty of time to
[1:29:24] turn from their idolatry
[1:29:26] but they despised god's goodness and
[1:29:29] god's
[1:29:29] long suffering and refused to repent
[1:29:32] yeah they had witnesses they could
[1:29:35] they witnessed that the jehovah god of
[1:29:38] abraham
[1:29:40] they witnessed him they've given him a
[1:29:42] young
[1:29:43] a young son or son in his wife in his
[1:29:46] old age
[1:29:47] they saw the miracle they saw
[1:29:51] him leaving idolatry and come out to
[1:29:54] serve the one true and living god
[1:29:56] they would see it that in a time of
[1:29:59] famine that god would tell
[1:30:01] isaac stay in the land don't go out of
[1:30:04] the land and he stayed in the land
[1:30:06] and he sowed in the time of famine
[1:30:10] and in the time of famine he reaped a
[1:30:13] hundredfold
[1:30:16] isn't that amazing because a man stayed
[1:30:20] in the promised land
[1:30:22] he stayed in the word he got more by
[1:30:25] staying in the word
[1:30:26] in a time of famine that he could do it
[1:30:29] running down to egypt
[1:30:30] where they had the nile river to water
[1:30:32] their crops come on somebody
[1:30:35] amen this is a god who who vindicates
[1:30:39] his servants
[1:30:40] and he had vindicated the word over and
[1:30:42] over and over and over to them
[1:30:45] they had seen it now
[1:30:49] but in abraham's day the amorite had not
[1:30:52] yet come
[1:30:53] corrupt enough to lose canaan
[1:30:58] and so it doesn't immediately go to
[1:31:00] abraham
[1:31:02] but when it does god uses his own his
[1:31:05] people to carry out the sentence
[1:31:07] you send see men can sin brazenly for a
[1:31:10] short time
[1:31:12] judgment will surely fall when their
[1:31:14] evil works are complete
[1:31:16] as john calvin said when god gets ready
[1:31:19] to judge a nation he sends him wicked
[1:31:21] rulers
[1:31:23] are you with me and god's judgment today
[1:31:25] is upon the methodists
[1:31:27] look how they have turned to homosexuals
[1:31:30] his
[1:31:30] judgment is upon the baptist the
[1:31:32] pentecostals
[1:31:33] he's what's he doing he's calling his
[1:31:36] elect out of the denomination
[1:31:38] and leaving them in their wickedness
[1:31:41] and let me say god's judgment is on this
[1:31:44] nation
[1:31:46] he has turned them over to a rebel mind
[1:31:49] and if you're not careful you get swept
[1:31:51] away
[1:31:53] with that reprobate mind that it said
[1:31:55] that is taken off because it's the mind
[1:31:58] of satan
[1:31:58] coming down are you with me satan's
[1:32:01] about to take over this world
[1:32:04] you heard me right when the bride leaves
[1:32:07] chaos breaks over
[1:32:09] hey man satan comes down he has a better
[1:32:11] short time
[1:32:13] and the kingdoms of this world are
[1:32:15] preparing
[1:32:16] to crown a satan as
[1:32:19] their king they're already doing it
[1:32:23] they're doing it in our universities
[1:32:25] they're doing it in our schools
[1:32:27] they're doing it with their curriculums
[1:32:30] they're doing it with their anna god the
[1:32:32] antichrist movements
[1:32:34] somebody help me preach now this is
[1:32:37] where we are
[1:32:40] judgment is on this nation a person or a
[1:32:43] nation can reject the gospel
[1:32:45] to a point that god rejects them
[1:32:50] amen and then he curses their conscience
[1:32:55] that's pretty heavy right there let me
[1:32:58] repeat it god
[1:32:59] god can what god will do with a person
[1:33:03] who rejects
[1:33:04] his word and his gospel
[1:33:08] and they can do it to a point that
[1:33:11] that in turn that god rejects them and
[1:33:14] when he does
[1:33:15] he curses their conscience
[1:33:21] listen don't don't the united states
[1:33:23] appear in revelation 13.
[1:33:25] in their number 13. wasn't there 13

[1:34:26] and they've insisted on meeting together
[1:34:29] you know they answered the solution
[1:34:31] they just built a fence around them
[1:34:33] where they can't even get into their
[1:34:35] property
[1:34:36] to keep them from having church
[1:34:40] that's supposed to be a democratic
[1:34:42] nation

[1:35:09] their homes do you hear what i'm saying
[1:35:11] amen this is how close how close we came
[1:35:14] to losing freedom
[1:35:21] we we are here in a time
[1:35:24] like never before and it's going home
[1:35:27] time
[1:35:29] and you're either going to take the mind
[1:35:31] of christ or the mark or the mind of the
[1:35:33] beast
[1:35:34] the bible said these are all have one
[1:35:36] mind and they gave it to the beast
[1:35:40] and you're seeing the people becoming of
[1:35:42] one mind
[1:35:45] i'm i kind of waffle and vacillate
[1:35:49] between the thoughts
[1:35:51] was there was this election stolen
[1:35:55] or did we have that many absolutely
[1:35:59] crazy insane people
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:08] do you hear what we're talking about
[1:36:10] where the majority now
[1:36:13] have a reprobate mind no conscience
[1:36:18] no because you can tell they have no
[1:36:20] conscience they'll abort them full-term
[1:36:23] babies and kill

[1:36:38] crazy things that are happening
[1:36:40] in our nation today things that you know
[1:36:44] don't make a lick of sense
[1:36:46] if you got any sense
[1:36:50] but you see what has it been the
[1:36:52] iniquity hasn't been full
[1:36:54] until now we're in the time where
[1:36:58] it is heaped up starting to run over
[1:37:01] amen and it happened in that day and god
[1:37:04] called
[1:37:05] an exodus to go take over that land
[1:37:09] amen and god's calling in exodus in this
[1:37:12] land
[1:37:13] amen from me from egypt to the promised
[1:37:15] land
[1:37:16] now of course as it does now they're
[1:37:19] getting ready to leave and there's been
[1:37:21] the token applied and
[1:37:23] a move of the spirit of god and the
[1:37:25] firstborn is dying
[1:37:27] and and the and and uh there
[1:37:31] you know darin pharaoh calls for moses
[1:37:36] you'll find this in chapter 8 verse 25
[1:37:39] of exodus then pharaoh calls for moses
[1:37:42] and aaron and said
[1:37:44] go sacrifice your god in the land in
[1:37:46] other words stay in egypt
[1:37:50] and and moses says it's not meat for us
[1:37:53] to do so we can't do this
[1:37:55] for we sacrifice i want you to watch the
[1:37:58] word we
[1:37:58] sacrifice the abomination of the
[1:38:01] egyptians to the lord our god
[1:38:03] lord we sacrifice the abomination of
[1:38:06] egyptians before their eyes will they
[1:38:07] not stone us
[1:38:09] we will go three days journey into the
[1:38:12] wilderness and sacrifice
[1:38:13] to the lord our god as he hath commanded
[1:38:16] us
[1:38:17] now they they're saying we can't
[1:38:20] worship here we got to go
[1:38:23] three days journey from egypt
[1:38:27] we must go to justification
[1:38:31] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[1:38:34] ghost
[1:38:35] in order to to go into the promised land
[1:38:38] amen and the and and pharaoh said i'll
[1:38:42] let you go that
[1:38:43] you may sacrifice to the lord your god
[1:38:45] in the wilderness only
[1:38:47] ye shall not go very far away from me
[1:38:50] you know far away and free from me you
[1:38:53] see
[1:38:54] you know again they were there was
[1:38:57] i'll let you go but only so far
[1:39:00] you see they
[1:39:04] here moses realized i can't sacrifice
[1:39:08] what is the abomination what the
[1:39:11] egyptians hate
[1:39:14] we can't worship like that they would
[1:39:17] stone us
[1:39:18] and you know they they say uh the days
[1:39:22] of the
[1:39:22] the spirit of moving is past they don't
[1:39:25] want
[1:39:26] that in the land of egypt that's why we
[1:39:28] can't worship them because when we
[1:39:30] worship
[1:39:31] we kill their sacred cows of
[1:39:34] easy believism we slit the throat
[1:39:37] of a religion without emotion and we
[1:39:40] offer a praise to our god
[1:39:44] amen and egyptians have no use for the
[1:39:47] holy spirit
[1:39:48] and the way it was back then they don't
[1:39:50] want the original pentecost it would
[1:39:52] kill their starchy baptist ways they
[1:39:55] want to sow
[1:39:56] intellectualize the message and we kill
[1:39:59] intellectualism
[1:40:05] now in egypt you're educated to god
[1:40:08] but when you come three days journey to
[1:40:10] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:40:12] you kill egyptian religion dead
[1:40:16] amen now you know as i said
[1:40:20] you know they pharaoh said just go so
[1:40:22] far
[1:40:23] and he said you know he said
[1:40:27] we can't just go so far see moses said
[1:40:30] we've
[1:40:30] got to get out of egypt we've got to get
[1:40:33] out to be able to worship
[1:40:35] we got to take a three-day journey we
[1:40:37] got to get to the baptism of the holy
[1:40:39] ghost
[1:40:40] and we don't believe in just going so
[1:40:42] far
[1:40:43] they've done that in the past they went
[1:40:46] to justification or they went to
[1:40:47] sanctification or they went to the gift
[1:40:49] but there's got to be a people
[1:40:51] go all the way so we don't believe in a
[1:40:54] super religion
[1:40:56] we're not going just so far we're going
[1:40:58] to take every divine promise of god
[1:41:01] if there's healing there we want that
[1:41:03] healing if there's deliverance we want
[1:41:05] that delivered
[1:41:06] if there's salvation of our children we
[1:41:08] want that salvation
[1:41:14] amen all the pharaoh says but you don't
[1:41:18] have to have this victory
[1:41:20] you don't need this freedom you don't
[1:41:23] have to weep your way to calvary and cry
[1:41:25] and die out to sin
[1:41:26] you don't have to go that far just
[1:41:28] settle down to
[1:41:30] good old denominational life you know
[1:41:32] come to church and
[1:41:33] you know pay your little dues and put
[1:41:35] your name on the book and
[1:41:37] you know but but again the sacrifices we
[1:41:40] offer
[1:41:41] they are an abomination to the egyptians
[1:41:44] they can't stand it when we surrender
[1:41:47] what they consider the best
[1:41:49] and what they worship
[1:41:52] tighten your belt up right now you see
[1:41:55] cattle
[1:41:56] was considered divine to the egyptians
[1:41:59] a bull was actually considered to be one
[1:42:02] of the most
[1:42:02] divine gods if the hebrews would set a
[1:42:06] sacrifice a bull in front of the
[1:42:08] egyptian
[1:42:09] they would stone them with stones you
[1:42:12] see
[1:42:13] you know what you see what we consider
[1:42:17] uh what we sacrifice or surrender to our
[1:42:20] god
[1:42:21] is actually considered divine
[1:42:24] to the egyptians don't miss this point
[1:42:28] they actually worship and make a god out
[1:42:31] of education
[1:42:34] we don't we use it to further our needs
[1:42:39] but we don't worship it in fact we
[1:42:42] surrender it
[1:42:44] we sacrifice we kill the knowledge of
[1:42:47] man
[1:42:48] for the knowledge of god
[1:42:52] amen brother this makes us despised by
[1:42:55] the egyptians they can't stand it
[1:42:58] because education is their god
[1:43:04] we are people who surrenders education
[1:43:06] and scientific knowledge
[1:43:07] for god's word our men give up
[1:43:10] effeminate spirits
[1:43:14] and the egyptians will hate you for it
[1:43:18] come on now amen we give them up or kill
[1:43:21] or sacrifice
[1:43:22] a effeminate spirits they want men to be
[1:43:26] sissies they don't want them to be the
[1:43:27] head of the house
[1:43:29] no way they want that killed
[1:43:32] or they don't want that killed rather
[1:43:34] why oh isn't he a darling oh my
[1:43:37] he sports a necklace look at him he's
[1:43:40] found his feminine side
[1:43:42] he puts on his shorts isn't he cute and
[1:43:45] his
[1:43:46] his hair is like a punk in his closure
[1:43:48] tight
[1:43:49] isn't he a darling he done found his
[1:43:52] feminine side
[1:43:54] i did mine too about 45 years ago i
[1:43:57] brought her down to the altar
[1:44:00] and we became one i'm the masculine
[1:44:02] she's the feminine
[1:44:03] we're one amen
[1:44:06] but when we sacrifice we kill that bull
[1:44:10] we surrender we give up the world and
[1:44:13] the things of the world
[1:44:15] amen first corinthians six and nine
[1:44:18] emblazonedness on your heart
[1:44:20] know you not that the unrighteousness
[1:44:22] shall not
[1:44:23] inherit the kingdom of god be not
[1:44:25] deceived
[1:44:26] neither fornicators nor idolaters nor
[1:44:29] adulterers
[1:44:30] nor effeminate nor abusers with
[1:44:32] themselves
[1:44:33] of themselves of mankind nor deeds nor
[1:44:35] covetous nor
[1:44:36] drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners
[1:44:39] shall inherit the kingdom of god
[1:44:45] of such were some of you
[1:44:48] but you are lost but you are sanctified
[1:44:52] but you are justified in the name of our
[1:44:55] lord jesus
[1:44:56] and by the spirit of our god some of you
[1:44:58] were that way
[1:45:00] and each of you worshipped us those gods
[1:45:02] but you've done come
[1:45:03] three days journey you came to
[1:45:06] justification
[1:45:07] sanctification and the spirit of our god
[1:45:10] came upon you
[1:45:14] hallelujah
[1:45:19] now if it's true that man is not to be
[1:45:21] effeminate but masculine
[1:45:23] then the woman is to be feminine she's
[1:45:26] not to be
[1:45:27] hard she should be soft
[1:45:30] the egyptians of the day make the woman
[1:45:32] hard
[1:45:36] she is the head of the house she wears
[1:45:39] the pants
[1:45:40] ain't no husband gonna tell her not to
[1:45:42] cut her hair
[1:45:44] she can be managed if she wants to be
[1:45:46] she isn't going to be led
[1:45:48] she's going to lead she will be the
[1:45:51] marine
[1:45:52] the warrior the police the mayor
[1:45:55] the congress governors the the the
[1:45:58] governor the vice president and the
[1:46:01] president
[1:46:05] amen in today's world egypt's
[1:46:09] gods are portrayed as a weak man
[1:46:12] and a strong woman
[1:46:17] and the israelis kill that god
[1:46:23] they sacrifice it they give it up to god
[1:46:30] and by giving it up god looks at it as
[1:46:32] something holy
[1:46:35] you see no true israelite woman will
[1:46:38] wear a garment that pertains to man
[1:46:42] any more than a true israelite man will
[1:46:44] wear garments that pertain to a woman
[1:46:49] as brother branham said in the thigh
[1:46:51] tyrion church age
[1:46:52] now woman is not meant to have an iron
[1:46:54] disposition
[1:46:56] she is according to the holy scripture
[1:46:58] be submissive to the male that's
[1:47:00] commanded up
[1:47:01] a woman who is truly female all female
[1:47:03] will be of that disposition
[1:47:05] not a doormat no real male
[1:47:08] makes a female a doormat but she'll want
[1:47:12] to be under authority and not rule over
[1:47:14] the mail for he is the head of the house
[1:47:16] and if she breaks that image god made
[1:47:18] for her she is perverted
[1:47:19] and any man that lets a woman take
[1:47:21] authority has also broken that image and
[1:47:24] he has perverted
[1:47:25] that is why a woman cannot wear that
[1:47:27] which pertaining to a man
[1:47:29] or cut her hair she is never to wear
[1:47:31] garments that pertain to mail
[1:47:32] or cut her hair when she does she's
[1:47:34] intruding into the
[1:47:36] male domain taking authority perverting
[1:47:38] herself
[1:47:39] and when a woman invades the pulpit
[1:47:42] [Music]
[1:47:43] which is commanded she must not do
[1:47:46] she shows what spirit she is uh being a
[1:47:49] dominating female is antichrist
[1:47:52] and the seeds of the roman catholic
[1:47:54] church are entered though she may deny
[1:47:56] this ever so vehemently
[1:47:57] but when it comes to the word let god
[1:48:01] be true and every man's word alive
[1:48:06] amen but now keep this in balance now
[1:48:09] because no true male
[1:48:11] will make a woman a doormat
[1:48:15] she ain't something for you to wipe your
[1:48:17] feet on
[1:48:18] she has something to love and to cherish
[1:48:21] to care for and to nourish
[1:48:24] amen no no it ain't
[1:48:27] you say well brother tim you make all
[1:48:29] the decisions in the house well
[1:48:31] you know does stop here i am responsible
[1:48:35] but there ain't nothing we do that we
[1:48:36] don't do together
[1:48:40] i don't have a separate bankround from
[1:48:42] hers you don't have one for me
[1:48:44] i don't do that i don't go and buy my
[1:48:47] buy
[1:48:47] buy a car without getting her approval
[1:48:50] i asked her to ask her what you know why
[1:48:53] cause i love her
[1:48:55] i want to please her it's my joy to make
[1:48:58] her happy
[1:49:01] but when it comes down to the where the
[1:49:03] rubber meets the road
[1:49:05] i take i take responsibility for the
[1:49:08] decisions that has to be made in the
[1:49:10] house
[1:49:12] we work together i'm not alone
[1:49:16] she's not alone i'm not by myself she's
[1:49:19] not by herself
[1:49:20] we're together in this and any true
[1:49:24] marriage relationship has to be that way
[1:49:28] are you with me but a man is to have the
[1:49:31] image of christ he is to love his wife
[1:49:34] and give himself for her
[1:49:38] see your wife going astray where what
[1:49:42] are you going to do about it
[1:49:43] you're not going to win her back with an
[1:49:45] angry look and a fist
[1:49:48] amen the best way you can do it is be a
[1:49:51] real man
[1:49:52] kneel yourself down to an altar
[1:49:54] somewhere and call on god until god
[1:49:56] changes the situation
[1:49:58] [Applause]
[1:50:00] amen oh that a people would know their
[1:50:02] god

[1:50:05] can do exploits

[1:53:20] how often he told you
[1:53:22] surely you do how often he told you
[1:53:26] that you were worthless
[1:53:31] and after this liberty you had during
[1:53:34] this meeting
[1:53:36] all of a sudden pharaoh wakes up and
[1:53:38] says oh

[1:53:44] i mean the devil told you over and over
[1:53:46] how worthless you are no good

[1:54:03] different truth

[1:54:08] my young people i got news for you devil
[1:54:11] they never originally ever belonged to
[1:54:13] you
[1:54:15] they were gods from the beginning before
[1:54:18] the foundation of the world
[1:54:20] god had you in his mind
[1:54:30] now he's been on your trail hat
[1:54:34] he's been whispering in your ear had me
[1:54:36] he's been lying to you over and over
[1:54:38] again
[1:54:40] all of a sudden you ain't worthless no
[1:54:43] more you're worth pursuing
[1:54:55] [Applause]
[1:55:00] somebody help me preach now amen
[1:55:03] all of a sudden you're worth pursuing
[1:55:07] so now he's on your trail
[1:55:12] you know demons are stubborn
[1:55:16] actually stubbornness is a demon spirit
[1:55:20] amen there is iniquity and idolatry
[1:55:24] because you worship that spirit
[1:55:27] and you know you can watch them when
[1:55:30] they get a hold of a person
[1:55:32] they'll scream i won't come out
[1:55:36] or you can't have her you'll hear them
[1:55:39] in a
[1:55:39] growl you know i've had them growl at me
[1:55:42] in a gruff voice saying i won't come out
[1:55:47] when that girl come on the prayer lie in
[1:55:49] the prayer line
[1:55:50] there some years ago at camp now and
[1:55:53] there she cried
[1:55:54] the moment that i laid my hands on her
[1:55:56] and anointed with all
[1:55:57] she crouched down like a an animal and a
[1:56:00] and a grotesque look come on her face
[1:56:03] and a snarl come out of her mouth
[1:56:05] and she was growling and she was
[1:56:08] swinging at me
[1:56:09] i won't let go you know i won't let go
[1:56:12] i i won't i will not go
[1:56:17] well you saw what happened didn't you he
[1:56:20] had to go
[1:56:22] he didn't come to the wrong youth camp
[1:56:29] he wants to say i won't come out i won't
[1:56:32] come out i won't come out
[1:56:33] he's stubborn but for a believer
[1:56:36] devils are subject to us we rule them
[1:56:40] they don't rule us
[1:56:42] we say go and they have to go
[1:56:45] [Applause]
[1:56:49] if we say shut up they gotta close their
[1:56:51] mouth
[1:56:52] that's the first thing i did when that
[1:56:54] girl was scaring all the kids
[1:56:56] in the in the prayer line there and i
[1:56:58] could see the look of terror on their
[1:56:59] face
[1:57:01] daniel you were there right there right
[1:57:03] there you know what happened
[1:57:05] and i forbid her to speak
[1:57:10] she had to shut up because when the son
[1:57:13] of god says shut up to the devil
[1:57:16] why don't you just practice that
[1:57:21] come on i mean the devil's been talking
[1:57:24] to you we're telling the chef
[1:57:28] come on the bible said that
[1:57:31] that the lord hardened the heart of the
[1:57:33] pharaoh the king
[1:57:35] and and that and he pursued after them
[1:57:38] but said the children
[1:57:39] of israel went out with a high hand
[1:57:44] oh hallelujah their emotions must have
[1:57:47] soared
[1:57:48] when they walked away from the
[1:57:50] brickyards
[1:57:52] amen when their firstborn wasn't was
[1:57:55] still alive and
[1:57:56] laughing and playing they left egypt
[1:57:59] with a
[1:57:59] high handle we might say that went out
[1:58:02] on a real high
[1:58:04] hallelujah they that went out with it
[1:58:07] would defiantly the word means
[1:58:10] hallelujah in open resistance
[1:58:14] actually they went out rebelliously
[1:58:18] the right time to use rebelliousness
[1:58:21] that's when it's against that tyrant the
[1:58:23] devil
[1:58:24] they went out rebelliously resisting his
[1:58:27] authority
[1:58:28] and his control they went out shouting
[1:58:32] they were saying i'm free and i'm not a
[1:58:35] slave any longer
[1:58:36] i'm not a slave to fear i'm not a slave
[1:58:39] to now
[1:58:40] i'm not a slave to your thoughts they
[1:58:42] can't control me
[1:58:44] i will control them by casting them down
[1:58:52] but that dumb devil pursued after them
[1:58:55] it looks like he should have learned
[1:58:57] long before that
[1:58:59] you know and that uh
[1:59:02] that he ain't gonna win he didn't win
[1:59:06] one of the times and here he comes one
[1:59:08] more time
[1:59:09] and god says i've hardened his heart
[1:59:12] because
[1:59:13] i'm going to destroy him and i'm going
[1:59:16] to use you
[1:59:16] to be the bait
[1:59:20] are you with me yeah i'm going to use
[1:59:22] you hey he's using young people in this
[1:59:24] age to beat the bait
[1:59:26] to the devil amen come on down here
[1:59:30] you're not going to get them you're
[1:59:32] going to find your destruction
[1:59:35] you're not coming here for victory
[1:59:37] you're coming here for destruction
[1:59:40] are you with me amen now listen the
[1:59:43] enemy was
[1:59:44] more than a match for them oh yes it was
[1:59:48] pharaoh had 600 chosen chariots
[1:59:51] plus the chariots of egypt
[1:59:55] and satan is more than a match for us
[1:59:59] don't go to thinking he isn't brother
[2:00:02] bradley said we know that
[2:00:04] we know that satan is way more than a
[2:00:06] match for any human being
[2:00:09] don't you never try to do it with your
[2:00:11] wisdom
[2:00:12] and outsmart him you just can't do it
[2:00:15] jesus knew this
[2:00:16] so he said to the church that so satan
[2:00:19] would not outsmart them
[2:00:20] a place to be fortified he sent them the
[2:00:23] holy ghost
[2:00:24] and the church doesn't claim to be smart
[2:00:27] they just claim to believe
[2:00:31] now you're not going to out argue him
[2:00:33] you're not going to outsmart him
[2:00:36] but you cannot believe him
[2:00:40] because that's what you are is a
[2:00:42] believer
[2:00:44] so you doubt your doubts and believe
[2:00:47] what god
[2:00:47] said is that right
[2:00:51] amen listen how prophet goes against
[2:00:54] satan when he prays for a child who is
[2:00:56] dying with leukemia
[2:00:57] he preaches an old sermon to a young
[2:00:59] girl in the greatest battle ever fought
[2:01:02] in this prayer he said god this child
[2:01:04] probably is the most sickest person in
[2:01:06] the building this morning because she
[2:01:08] can't
[2:01:08] live without you very much longer she's
[2:01:11] the most sickened
[2:01:13] and we are we're agreeing as every
[2:01:15] soldier standing here
[2:01:16] and in this group stands the royal seed
[2:01:20] of abraham you see what he's doing
[2:01:21] he's positioning us that's the whole
[2:01:25] thing
[2:01:25] is positioning before you meet the devil
[2:01:27] you position yourself
[2:01:31] amen come on well you say but brother
[2:01:34] tim
[2:01:35] you know i got the holy ghost but now
[2:01:38] the devil is trying to make me doubt it
[2:01:40] well of course he is
[2:01:42] that's what he did to jesus
[2:01:47] as soon as he got the holy ghost god
[2:01:49] wasn't scared of it
[2:01:51] he led him into the wilderness to be
[2:01:53] tempted of the devil
[2:01:55] come on somebody amen he knew that what
[2:01:58] he had given him
[2:01:59] worked that it would not fail
[2:02:04] is that right amen so what the enemy do
[2:02:06] he came in
[2:02:07] and said and question his
[2:02:12] relationship with god if thou be the son
[2:02:15] of god
[2:02:17] this is what the devil comes to you if
[2:02:19] you were a son
[2:02:21] if you are really a son prove it to me
[2:02:25] [Music]
[2:02:28] you don't owe the devil nothing
[2:02:31] come on somebody you do not owe him a
[2:02:34] thing
[2:02:35] you don't have to prove to him nothing
[2:02:38] amen so jesus didn't even use
[2:02:41] his power he didn't go and get anointed
[2:02:45] again and
[2:02:46] then let me shout for a moment can i get
[2:02:48] that feeling i got
[2:02:49] that that sunday into sunday or that
[2:02:52] that saturday night when brother ron was
[2:02:54] free can i get that feeling again
[2:02:56] he didn't say that he wasn't feeling it
[2:03:00] right now
[2:03:01] [Music]
[2:03:05] he was not feeling it right then you
[2:03:07] know what he was feeling
[2:03:09] the dirty rotten evil presence
[2:03:13] of lucifer himself snarling
[2:03:16] at his face and if you don't think that
[2:03:18] was an atmosphere
[2:03:19] it was
[2:03:30] my brother tim i i i i ain't feeling
[2:03:33] what i did
[2:03:35] no but that didn't change what it gave
[2:03:38] you
[2:03:39] [Applause]
[2:03:41] that don't happen that don't change what
[2:03:43] happened to jesus on the river jordan
[2:03:46] when god said this is my beloved son
[2:03:50] and when you got the holy ghost the
[2:03:51] other day that's what god was saying
[2:03:53] come on
[2:03:54] amen you may not have seen it you may
[2:03:56] not have heard it but it was there
[2:03:59] amen you can tell by the effects come on
[2:04:02] amen what
[2:04:02] this is my beloved son the son
[2:04:06] i love
[2:04:10] now if you're a real father you can tell
[2:04:12] your children you love them
[2:04:15] this is what jesus did was told this is
[2:04:18] my beloved
[2:04:19] son in whom
[2:04:23] i am so happy to live in
[2:04:27] to make my boat in they've surrendered
[2:04:30] up their lives
[2:04:31] they yielded themselves to god and i am
[2:04:34] just
[2:04:34] delighted to live in them
[2:04:42] now he goes and the holy spirit leads
[2:04:45] him
[2:04:45] into the wilderness to be tempted of the
[2:04:49] devil not a devil but
[2:04:52] the devil now most of us maybe
[2:04:55] i don't know maybe we never meet the
[2:04:57] devil
[2:04:59] but we sure meet a devil
[2:05:06] you could see him in the other round
[2:05:08] brother branham did one time he said i
[2:05:11] was laying there and he said i looked
[2:05:13] over in the corner
[2:05:14] and he said i felt the funniest spirit
[2:05:17] and i looked over and there
[2:05:19] was a a creature it looked like a
[2:05:22] deformed
[2:05:23] creature you see because satan lost his
[2:05:25] original state
[2:05:27] and he looked like a deformed creature
[2:05:29] like alley-oop in the
[2:05:30] funny paper and he was cackling
[2:05:34] like him going to the barn and he was
[2:05:37] saying to me
[2:05:38] you're nothing but a fake and these
[2:05:40] miracles and you
[2:05:42] that you say is nothing but a fake
[2:05:45] well if the if the devil has the
[2:05:47] audacity to come into the presence
[2:05:50] of a prophet of god malachi 4 and tell
[2:05:53] him he's of faith
[2:05:55] what do you think he's going to do to
[2:05:57] you
[2:05:58] he's going to come right up to you and
[2:06:01] say you just been faking all of this
[2:06:04] you faked that shot the other day that
[2:06:06] was you jumped
[2:06:07] that was you that was you that was you
[2:06:12] because he's pursuing you
[2:06:16] all of a sudden you worthless no good
[2:06:20] thing
[2:06:20] is something he's got to have back
[2:06:30] now so how do we approach it
[2:06:34] we approach him first of all knowing who
[2:06:36] we are that's why i've told the brothers
[2:06:37] years ago
[2:06:38] you know and have advocated y'all put an
[2:06:41] adoption way over in the
[2:06:42] future sure adoption change of our body
[2:06:45] that's the
[2:06:45] that's the redemption of our body we got
[2:06:48] that
[2:06:48] but this adoption that we have received
[2:06:51] individually as sons
[2:06:53] is when you receive the holy ghost you
[2:06:55] shall receive power
[2:06:56] when the holy ghost has come upon you
[2:06:59] otherwise people are standing
[2:07:01] over there hiding behind the organ in
[2:07:03] our chair somewhere the piano
[2:07:05] and saying oh my god you know the
[2:07:07] devil's here and we don't know what to
[2:07:08] do you know because
[2:07:10] we ain't got the power yet and we're not
[2:07:12] adopted yet and
[2:07:13] you know we hadn't come into maturity
[2:07:15] yet come on now
[2:07:18] i you no wonder the devil is buffaloed
[2:07:20] the churches everywhere
[2:07:22] they don't realize who they are that now
[2:07:25] we are the sons of god
[2:07:27] that you shall receive power after the
[2:07:29] holy ghost has come upon you
[2:07:31] come on amen we have the power we're not
[2:07:34] waiting on the power
[2:07:41] you misapply things you get you go and
[2:07:43] look for all the quotes and
[2:07:45] well brother adam said when the squeeze
[2:07:47] comes down what's the third pulled them
[2:07:49] let me tell you something squeeze has
[2:07:51] been here a long time
[2:07:53] amen the devil has been squeezing and
[2:07:55] pressure is everywhere
[2:07:57] amen but let me tell you there was never
[2:08:00] time that persecution
[2:08:02] ever put the power of god in the church
[2:08:05] amen it's the holy ghost that puts the
[2:08:07] power of god
[2:08:08] in the church we don't have to wait on a
[2:08:11] squeeze
[2:08:12] we have the power now by the baptism of
[2:08:16] the holy ghost oh brother tim
[2:08:23] when when it all comes down well read
[2:08:26] feast of the trumpets
[2:08:28] you'll find brother branham changes the
[2:08:30] turns a corner
[2:08:32] and says we'll go through none of that
[2:08:35] that's to the foolish virgin and god
[2:08:37] gives him
[2:08:38] as joshua dividing the inheritance gives
[2:08:41] that portion
[2:08:42] over to the foolish virgins and to the
[2:08:44] 144 thousand
[2:08:46] but he said we get nothing but the
[2:08:49] rapture
[2:08:57] it is wonderful to know you will go to
[2:08:59] the tribulation church
[2:09:01] and you ain't got to have tribulation to
[2:09:03] bring the power
[2:09:05] it never will make you mature what makes
[2:09:07] you mature
[2:09:08] is the baptism of the holy ghost that
[2:09:10] bursts you a son or daughter of god
[2:09:12] and that gives you the authority what
[2:09:15] you do is you wrap that
[2:09:17] rogue around you the baptism of the holy
[2:09:20] ghost and you take that authority
[2:09:22] because you got a ring on your finger
[2:09:24] that he put on there the seal of the
[2:09:26] holy ghost and you say
[2:09:27] satan you take your hands off of god's
[2:09:30] property
[2:09:32] lose them and let them go i have met a
[2:09:35] pillar of fire
[2:09:36] i stood in this prison i have been
[2:09:38] changed
[2:09:39] by the power of god and i have a thigh
[2:09:43] of the mighty angel who is my guardian
[2:09:46] who blesses what i bless and cleanses
[2:09:48] what i curse
[2:09:49] and is an adversary to my adversary and
[2:09:52] an enemy to my enemies
[2:10:00] unless he said in this group stands this
[2:10:03] royal seat of abraham
[2:10:05] we're marching in on satan now
[2:10:09] we're not running we're not retreating
[2:10:12] we're marching in on satan now and might
[2:10:15] as well get
[2:10:17] ready to go satan because our armors are
[2:10:20] gleaming
[2:10:20] and our colors are screamed streaming
[2:10:23] and men and women are holding swords
[2:10:27] marching forward upon you now for this
[2:10:30] little girl
[2:10:31] come out of her satan leave that child
[2:10:33] as the army of the living god we defy
[2:10:36] you
[2:10:36] leave her in the name of jesus christ
[2:10:40] i go lay hands upon her and satan you
[2:10:43] have bound this child
[2:10:44] you have done this evil i know you're
[2:10:47] more than a match for a human being
[2:10:49] but you're not a match for my lord so i
[2:10:52] come in his name
[2:10:54] leave her thou spirit of the devil thou
[2:10:56] demon of sickness
[2:10:58] come out of this child that she may go
[2:11:00] free from this day on i pronounce this
[2:11:03] in the name of jesus christ
[2:11:07] and then he says it has been spoken
[2:11:11] now let it be done
[2:11:17] you people keep telling me in prayer
[2:11:19] lines well the devil keeps telling me
[2:11:24] i have a simple question i want you to
[2:11:26] answer what
[2:11:27] are you listening to him for
[2:11:31] [Music]
[2:11:34] is satan's word greater than god's
[2:11:41] well brother tim he reminds me of my
[2:11:43] past
[2:11:44] well you're right that's the devil
[2:11:47] because god can't do that
[2:11:50] god can't remind once it's been forgiven
[2:11:52] come on somebody
[2:11:53] god justifies that means that you are
[2:11:56] righteous in his sight
[2:11:59] so if you have a spirit that comes up
[2:12:01] and reminds you of your past
[2:12:04] it ain't god and he ain't worth
[2:12:07] listening to
[2:12:09] and you can tell when he's lying when
[2:12:11] his lips are moving
[2:12:17] once forgiven god's justified that means
[2:12:20] he makes you
[2:12:21] righteous in his life let me paraphrase
[2:12:23] to you what paul said in the book of
[2:12:25] romans
[2:12:25] for whom he did for no he also did
[2:12:29] predestinate to be like his son
[2:12:31] that he might be a firstborn among many
[2:12:34] brethren
[2:12:35] and having chosen us he called us to
[2:12:38] come to him
[2:12:39] and when we came he declared us
[2:12:43] not guilty and he filled us with his
[2:12:46] spirit
[2:12:47] and gave us right standing with himself
[2:12:50] and promised us
[2:12:51] his glory what can we ever say to such

[2:14:42] pharaoh's best
[2:14:43] and they're all coming on yeah they are
[2:14:47] but i haven't forgotten you i actually
[2:14:50] called them to this battle because i'm
[2:14:53] going to get honor on pharaoh

[2:15:00] the enemy
[2:15:01] come on somebody harden their hearts
[2:15:04] just pursue you to try to overtake you
[2:15:08] to try to bring you back into slavery he
[2:15:11] will actually do
[2:15:12] everything that allow the devil to do
[2:15:15] everything he can
[2:15:16] because he's going to get honor over the
[2:15:17] devil that you ain't got enough devil
[2:15:22] you brought your best you have your
[2:15:24] terrorists you have the smaller cherry
[2:15:26] you got air the horses you got sword you
[2:15:29] got
[2:15:29] manpower but we got god
[2:15:33] you've got laodicea you got demons
[2:15:36] you got suicide spirits you got dope you
[2:15:39] got alcohol
[2:15:40] you got pornography but we got god
[2:15:45] and if god be power who
[2:15:48] can be against us
[2:15:58] sure you're gonna have trouble yeah
[2:16:01] certainly we face that we go through
[2:16:03] trouble and dangers that we face
[2:16:06] but overwhelming victory desires through
[2:16:08] christ
[2:16:09] who loved us enough to die for us
[2:16:13] come on somebody god pursued you too
[2:16:16] don't never forgot to forgive that amen
[2:16:19] not just the devil god pursued you
[2:16:22] remember because of this great love that
[2:16:24] he had for you
[2:16:26] before the world began he said you're my
[2:16:29] little children
[2:16:30] and i'm not gonna let you stay in bodies
[2:16:32] forever
[2:16:33] because this is the hour of freedom this
[2:16:36] is the hour
[2:16:37] of rejoicing it's the hour for people to
[2:16:40] go out
[2:16:40] with a high hand
[2:16:43] rebellious against the devil rebellious
[2:16:46] against this room
[2:16:48] [Applause]
[2:16:54] amen
[2:16:59] for i'm convinced that nothing can
[2:17:02] ever separate us from his love death
[2:17:06] can't
[2:17:07] and life can't angels won't
[2:17:10] and all the powers of hell itself cannot
[2:17:13] keep god's love away
[2:17:15] our fears for today are worries
[2:17:18] about tomorrow or where we are
[2:17:21] high above the skies or in the deepest
[2:17:23] ocean
[2:17:24] nothing will ever be able to separate us
[2:17:27] from the love of god demonstrated by our
[2:17:29] lord jesus christ
[2:17:31] when he died for us
[2:17:34] now so the devil tells you
[2:17:39] he keeps telling you you're in what you
[2:17:41] what you are in his sight
[2:17:45] that you're still a slave
[2:17:48] but what does god say he said you never
[2:17:52] originally belonged to the devil
[2:17:54] your mind and you're not only pardoned
[2:17:59] i want to give this talk to you you're
[2:18:01] not just
[2:18:03] pardon you're not just forgiven
[2:18:07] i mean you cheat me out of money and i
[2:18:10] forgive you
[2:18:12] but i still remember it and it may take
[2:18:16] me a long time to ever trust you again
[2:18:20] because i remember it right
[2:18:23] remember that ain't the way god does
[2:18:26] when god forgives
[2:18:28] he forgets it is though you've never
[2:18:32] done it amen you didn't even do it in
[2:18:37] the first place
[2:18:39] amen you look but you look and you see
[2:18:42] the enemy coming like a flood and
[2:18:44] pursuing you saying oh god oh god oh god
