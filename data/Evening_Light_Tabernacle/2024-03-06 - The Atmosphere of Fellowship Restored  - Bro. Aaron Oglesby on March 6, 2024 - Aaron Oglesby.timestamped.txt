[39:30] going to look in Hebrews the 9th
[39:32] chapter we'll read from verse 6 down
[39:35] through verse 14 Hebrews 9 and6 down
[39:38] through verse 14 I'd like to speak to
[39:40] you tonight on this thought that I've
[39:43] been looking at on the atmosphere of
[39:45] Fellowship
[39:47] restored the atmosphere of Fellowship
[39:51] restored amen verse six says now when
[39:54] these things were thus ordained
[39:56] the priest went always into the first
[39:59] Tabernacle accomplishing the service of
[40:01] God but into the second went the high
[40:04] priest alone once a year not without
[40:07] blood which he offered for himself and
[40:10] for the heers of the people the Holy
[40:12] Ghost this signifying that the way into
[40:15] the holiest of all was not yet made
[40:18] manifest while as the first Tabernacle
[40:21] was yet standing which was a figure for
[40:24] the time then present and which which we
[40:26] offered both gifts and sacrifices that
[40:29] could not make him that did the service
[40:31] perfect as pertaining to the conscience
[40:34] which stood only in meats and drinks and
[40:37] diverse Washings and carnal ordinances
[40:39] imposed on them until the time of
[40:42] reformation but Christ being come as a
[40:44] high priest of good things to come by a
[40:47] greater and more perfect Tabernacle not
[40:49] made with hands that is to say not of
[40:52] this building neither by the blood of
[40:54] bulls of of goats and calves but by his
[40:58] own blood he entered in once into the
[41:00] holy Place having obtained Eternal
[41:02] Redemption for us for if the blood of
[41:05] bulls and goats and the ashes of a
[41:07] hepher sprinkling the unclean sanctify
[41:10] to the purifying of the flesh how much
[41:14] more shall the blood of Christ who
[41:16] through the eternal spirit offered
[41:18] himself without spot to God Purge your
[41:21] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[41:24] Living God Amen I pra that the Lord will
[41:26] add his Blessing as you take your seat
[41:29] tonight amen how wonderful it is that
[41:32] our thoughts even can be purged and our
[41:34] conscience can be purged in order to
[41:36] serve a living God Amen anden the last
[41:40] time we spoke we spoke here on on on on
[41:43] atmospheres and the battle for
[41:45] atmospheres and I want to kind of pick
[41:47] up where I left off there tonight and
[41:49] and carry it on a little further down
[41:51] and and we talked about how in the
[41:53] beginning that the Earth had been in
[41:55] complete and total chaos and and it was
[41:57] without form and it was void and and
[42:00] brother Bram said what a horrible shape
[42:02] it must have been in nothing but we into
[42:04] the darkness Yonder without light or
[42:06] anything and the churning of the water
[42:08] and that wondering star twisted around
[42:11] and around the orbits out there
[42:13] somewhere it must have been a Terri a
[42:15] terrific mass of something lost a
[42:19] terrific mass of something lost and and
[42:21] the scripture then goes on to tell us
[42:23] there in in Genesis the very first
[42:25] chapter that the spirit of God moved
[42:28] upon the face of the waters and we find
[42:31] out right there in the very first
[42:33] chapter of the Bible that when God moves
[42:35] things don't stay the same when God
[42:37] begins to move on a heart that heart
[42:39] doesn't stay the same when he begins to
[42:41] move in a home that home doesn't stay
[42:43] the same when he begins to move in a
[42:45] church that church cannot stay the same
[42:48] and and tonight if he begins to move I
[42:50] promise you things won't stay the same
[42:53] when God moves things change and when
[42:55] God moves things change for the better
[42:58] amen and the Earth was in complete
[43:01] disorder and confusion but as the spirit
[43:03] of God began to move upon it out of that
[43:06] chaos came perfect order God can take
[43:10] any situation you're facing tonight no
[43:12] matter how chaotic it may seem and he
[43:15] can bring perfect order to that
[43:17] situation amen and and out of that in
[43:20] that perfect order out of that chaos
[43:22] comes an Eden and in that place of Eden
[43:26] Adam and Eve operated from a place of
[43:28] dominion they operated in a place of
[43:31] dominion with the power of the spoken
[43:33] word and in that atmosphere of Eden
[43:36] before the fall they were on speaking
[43:39] terms with God this isn't very important
[43:42] because we're talking about the
[43:43] restoring you the atmosphere of
[43:45] Fellowship in that atmosphere they had
[43:47] fellowship with God they could speak
[43:50] with God they were on speaking terms and
[43:53] and and Adam could speak and it was as
[43:55] though God himself
[43:57] spoke if Adam said move it moved if Adam
[44:00] said calm down it calmed down if he
[44:02] didn't like this tree in a certain place
[44:04] he said move and that tree moved he was
[44:06] the god of the earth they had fellowship
[44:10] with God and we know that because of the
[44:13] fall and because of the deception and
[44:15] Eve becoming begal that Fellowship was
[44:18] lost Fellowship became lost and without
[44:21] Fellowship mankind began to slip into
[44:25] chaos man this Earth began to slip into
[44:28] chaos like the Earth had been in before
[44:30] the spirit of God moved upon the face of
[44:32] it and we began to slip in into this
[44:35] chaos because we didn't have that daily
[44:37] contact with God we didn't have that
[44:40] fellowship with God anymore the the
[44:42] fellowship in the cool of the evenings
[44:44] as he would come down and walk with Adam
[44:46] and Eve and talk to them and and we know
[44:48] the atmospheres became clogged up with
[44:50] demons to where to where our blessings
[44:52] were cut off Communications were cut off
[44:56] and man becomes a werer and man has to
[44:58] care for himself and all the Outlets of
[45:01] Man became clogged up brother brand
[45:04] talked about how those Outlets that God
[45:06] had created he had made them there so
[45:08] that he could manifest himself through
[45:10] man and all of those Outlets become
[45:12] clogged up and the channels that he made
[45:14] man for and the atmosphere was all
[45:18] wrong everything was out of whack listen
[45:21] it wasn't meant for the lion to go
[45:22] around killing it wasn't meant for that
[45:25] that atmosphere was wrong it was meant
[45:27] for the lion to lay down with the lamb
[45:30] and when the atmospheres get wrong then
[45:32] God can't operate the way that he
[45:34] intends to operate what we have to
[45:36] remember tonight evening light
[45:38] Tabernacle is
[45:39] atmospheres
[45:42] produce now what do they produce well it
[45:44] depends on what the atmosphere is
[45:47] brother bram's very clear all through
[45:49] the message that it's the atmosphere
[45:50] that does it he says if you want to have
[45:52] a a healing meeting you got to get
[45:54] people in the atmosphere of healing he
[45:57] says if you want people filled with the
[45:58] spirit you got to get the place in the
[46:00] atmosphere of being filled with the
[46:02] spirit the atmospheres create that are
[46:05] created is what produces and so
[46:07] atmospheres produce so we need to make
[46:10] it a point as a people to make sure we
[46:13] get the atmosphere right well what is
[46:16] the right atmosphere tonight brother
[46:18] it's an atmosphere that welcomes him
[46:20] into our presence that welcomes his
[46:23] presence into our midst and then we
[46:24] allow him to move move how he wants to
[46:26] move but we want to welcome him we want
[46:29] the atmosphere right in our home we want
[46:32] the atmosphere right in our churches
[46:34] amen we have to create an atmosphere
[46:36] where he feels welcome to visit in our
[46:39] homes where he feels free to operate in
[46:42] our
[46:43] services every one of us have needs
[46:45] tonight every one of us stand here with
[46:48] situations and desires that that we need
[46:51] God to move in but in order for him to
[46:54] move for us we need to make him feel
[46:56] welcome so he can at least come on the
[46:58] scene tonight so he can come into this
[47:01] place and and then go to work on our
[47:03] behalf in our homes as Christians it
[47:06] ought to be a place where God feels
[47:08] welcome you want God to be in your home
[47:11] and you get the atmosphere right pray
[47:14] with the family read the Bible with the
[47:16] family stop all the fussing and
[47:18] fighting in a Christian home it
[47:21] shouldn't be a Home full of fussing and
[47:23] fighting and if there is fussing and
[47:25] fighting shame on you if the kids see
[47:28] it I don't know that just came out but
[47:30] that's how I feel if your kid see
[47:33] fusting and fighting shame on
[47:37] you well sometimes we're going to
[47:38] disagree y'all don't got a one-bedroom
[47:41] house go fuss and fight somewhere
[47:46] else I agree fussing and fighting
[47:49] shouldn't be in the
[47:50] church if there's fussing and fighting
[47:53] in the church the church will never
[47:54] attain to the high in the places that
[47:56] God wants it to attain to we are
[47:59] supposed to dwell together in unity
[48:01] dwell together in
[48:03] harmony it's very important well why is
[48:06] this happening and why let there's too
[48:07] much fussing and fighting amongst the
[48:09] children of God look I understand I know
[48:11] how it is Siblings tend to fight
[48:13] sometimes but that's no excuse for
[48:15] Spiritual siblings to fight sometimes
[48:18] we're trying to get out of here we're
[48:19] trying to lead we've got one goal we're
[48:22] on the same team quit getting divided
[48:25] over little
[48:27] nothings little nothings that don't
[48:29] matter but let's come together in unity
[48:31] and create an atmosphere where God is
[48:33] welcome where lives can be changed where
[48:36] God can move and heal and deliver and
[48:38] fill with the spirit and lay aside
[48:41] listen Unity doesn't mean we all agree
[48:44] it means we're willing to lay aside
[48:45] things for the cause of
[48:48] Christ let's lay things aside and get
[48:51] together to where it's not a place of
[48:53] fussing and fighting because our church
[48:55] are supposed to be
[48:57] fruitful and that will hinder a fruitful
[49:01] church but at the time the atmosphere
[49:04] was all twisted up and and our access to
[49:06] God was cut off but our God is a
[49:10] determined God our God was determined
[49:14] that he would once again have fellowship
[49:16] with man he was determined that the fall
[49:19] wasn't the end of it that sin nature
[49:21] wouldn't always rule over his creation
[49:24] and I want to tell you tonight he
[49:25] determined for you he's determined
[49:28] you're going to make it he's determined
[49:30] you're going to be there he's determined
[49:32] you're going to overcome he sees the
[49:34] trial you're in tonight and he says I'm
[49:36] determined you're coming through I'm
[49:37] determined you're going to make it just
[49:39] look to the word look to the word
[49:41] tonight and hold on I'm determined
[49:44] you're going to make it our God is a
[49:46] determined
[49:47] God and he comes down and he takes on
[49:50] flesh and he begins to operate the way
[49:54] that Adam was was able to operate in the
[49:57] beginning he begins to operate in in
[50:00] that flesh by taking Dominion by
[50:03] speaking the word by controlling nature
[50:06] and in that body of Flesh he conquer sin
[50:10] listen I I know we point to Calvary and
[50:13] you must point to Calvary but he didn't
[50:15] just conquer at Calvary he conquered sin
[50:19] every single day that's what made his
[50:22] death worthy to pay the price he was
[50:24] sinless
[50:26] he conquered sin day after day after day
[50:30] after day he met Satan and he overcame
[50:32] he met Temptation and he overcame
[50:35] Hebrews said he was tempted in like
[50:36] manner as you tempted in everything that
[50:39] you go through faith with depression and
[50:43] anxieties and he
[50:45] overcame it says in John 16 be of good
[50:48] cheer I have overcome the
[50:52] world well why is this so important so
[50:55] when you're born again and you're filled
[50:57] with that life that life has already
[51:01] overcome that sin that so easily beset
[51:03] you that life has already overcome lust
[51:07] that life has already overcome
[51:08] depression that life has already
[51:10] overcome anxiety that life has already
[51:14] overcome whatever it is you're facing
[51:16] tonight it's already been attacked with
[51:18] heartache it's already been attacked
[51:20] with depression and that life came
[51:22] through sinless that life came through
[51:25] Victorious and now that life lives on
[51:28] the inside of you
[51:31] tonight be of good
[51:34] cheer be of good cheer but brother Aaron
[51:37] this is the worst thing I've ever been
[51:38] through he's already conquered it this
[51:41] is the toughest temptation of my life

[51:51] he's already defeated it listen he says
[51:54] the life that I'm sending back to endue
[51:57] you with power is Battle tested the life
[52:00] that I'm sending you has already been
[52:02] proven it won't fail you in the middle
[52:04] of the battle it won't come up short in
[52:06] the middle of your Temptation it is
[52:08] tried it is true it will overcome it'll
[52:12] take you all the way to a Rapture it's a
[52:14] battle tested life and it's the only
[52:17] life that overcomes the world Amen your
[52:20] best efforts won't do
[52:24] it
[52:26] your religion won't do
[52:28] it your rules and regulations won't do
[52:31] it you have got to be born again so that
[52:35] the life of the Overcomer let me say
[52:37] that again the Overcomer there's only
[52:40] ever been
[52:41] one but when the life of the Overcomer
[52:45] takes control of your life then you
[52:47] become un Overcomer so get the Overcomer
[52:50] on the inside of you tonight and become
[52:52] an overcomer in the last day how am I
[52:54] going to do it the life of the Overcomer
[52:57] lives on the inside of me that was the
[53:00] whole point of the kinsman
[53:02] redeemer that was the whole point of God
[53:05] in flesh it was the whole point of
[53:07] Calvary so that the life of the
[53:09] sacrifice could come back on the
[53:12] worshipper to change his nature so he
[53:15] didn't leave their
[53:17] bound
[53:19] Hallelujah but they would come in and
[53:21] come underneath that shed blood and come
[53:23] out not only covered by it but Changed
[53:27] by it that's where we have to live so
[53:30] that we can say like Paul did in
[53:32] Galatians I'm crucify with Christ
[53:34] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[53:38] liveth in me Christ lives in you don't
[53:42] let that just become something we say
[53:43] don't let that be an emotion don't let
[53:45] that be a one-time altar experience
[53:48] Christ lives in you when daily every
[53:51] moment in the battle in the trial
[53:53] through the fire through the sickness
[53:55] Christ lives in me I live by Christ
[53:58] Alone
[54:01] amen listen some of you here know you've
[54:03] been born again you know you've been
[54:06] born again and you know that you've been
[54:08] changed and yet you find yourself
[54:10] crippled with
[54:12] fear you find yourself crippled with
[54:15] torment you find yourself crippled and
[54:18] bound with depression and you're trying
[54:21] your best to fight it you're trying to
[54:24] overcome those
[54:25] complexes you're trying you're trying to
[54:29] break those family Cycles you see the
[54:32] robber you know what it is you I I know
[54:34] I shouldn't I know it's a cycle I know
[54:37] it's a complex I know you see it and you
[54:40] recognize it and you know what's robbing
[54:43] you and the whole time think about it
[54:46] like this the whole time that life the
[54:49] life of the Overcomer is sitting right
[54:51] there on the inside of you saying just
[54:53] let me at him just let me at him just
[54:56] turn me loose I've already whooped this
[54:58] fell before I've overcome this before
[55:01] I've calm this storm before just let me
[55:03] deal with it just turn me loose tonight
[55:07] some of you's got a rock in the sling
[55:08] and you're standing there doing this at
[55:10] Goliath turn it loose tonight let it go
[55:13] and let it hit its Mark it's Christ on
[55:16] the inside of you turn him loose there's
[55:18] a line roaring let me have him let me
[55:21] have him but we got him caged up turn
[55:23] him loose tonight let him fight your
[55:25] battle he's already overcome it
[55:30] Hallelujah get out of his way tonight
[55:33] and let the life that has already
[55:35] overcome the world live itself out
[55:37] through
[55:41] you Jesus came and began to operate in
[55:43] the flesh the way that Adam had in the
[55:47] garden with
[55:49] dominion and with
[55:51] authority and he opens the way again to
[55:53] Fellowship by stripping Satan of every
[55:56] claim and every right he ever had on
[55:59] man and he paid the debt that only God
[56:02] in flesh could
[56:03] pay and once again a way was made
[56:06] through the atmospheres between God and
[56:07] man as brother brandham says the Bible
[56:10] said he ascended on high and give gifts
[56:13] unto men there was an atmosphere hung
[56:15] over the Earth of Darkness of Gloom of
[56:17] death and we the prayers couldn't come
[56:20] up because the atonement wasn't made but
[56:23] he broke through that Veil
[56:25] he opened up the way
[56:28] Hallelujah so when the world was in
[56:30] chaos with no hope he changed the
[56:34] atmosphere and created an
[56:36] Eden and then when man was lost without
[56:39] hope separated from God he came in flesh
[56:42] he changed the atmosphere and he paid
[56:45] sin's debt on
[56:46] Calvary and then he didn't stop right
[56:48] there too many people today preach
[56:50] Calvary and we should but it didn't stop
[56:53] right there he he went from Calvary down
[56:56] to Hell and he conquered hell yes he did
[56:58] then he comes up to the grave and he
[57:00] rises again and he conquers the grave
[57:03] and then he ascended and as he did he
[57:05] tore through those atmospheres that was
[57:07] clogged by demons and he made a way once
[57:09] again for access to God and now that he
[57:12] ascended and now that the price was paid
[57:15] now he could send back his
[57:18] life that was the whole point of
[57:21] it was sending back his life that it
[57:24] could live in the worshipper so he could
[57:26] send back the Holy Ghost set that so
[57:28] that other men could operate the way he
[57:33] operated so that other men could have
[57:35] dominion so that other men could
[57:37] overcome so that other men could cast
[57:40] out Devils so that other men could
[57:42] preach the the day of
[57:44] salvation that's what he sent it back
[57:46] for so that other men could do exactly
[57:49] what he had done while he was here on
[57:51] the earth in flesh it it wasn't about
[57:54] just being
[57:56] forgiven don't stop tonight at just
[57:59] forgiving I praise God that we're
[58:01] forgiven I thank God that we're
[58:03] Justified but don't stop there move on
[58:06] to sanctification and then don't stop
[58:08] there I Rejoice with you in your
[58:10] sanctification I'm not beating you down
[58:12] or de christianizing you I'm saying
[58:14] there's more for you tonight there's a
[58:16] token for you tonight there's an
[58:17] overcoming life here for you tonight
[58:20] press on to that
[58:23] tonight
[58:26] but now because he sends his life back
[58:28] now you can be
[58:30] empowered now man again could operate
[58:33] the way that God intended them to
[58:34] operate from the position that he
[58:37] intended them to operate from in the
[58:40] beginning even though Satan's still
[58:42] there saying you don't have a right to
[58:44] now you do have a right and you have to
[58:46] fight for it and you have to battle for
[58:47] it and he accuses you constantly but you
[58:50] have a right to be there you have a
[58:52] right to claim your promises you have a
[58:54] right right to cast Satan down you have
[58:56] a right to stand on the word you have a
[58:58] right to claim your children you have a
[59:00] right to claim your healing you're going
[59:02] to fight for it but you have a right to
[59:04] be
[59:06] there he was putting back he was putting
[59:09] man back in a place that they could now
[59:12] fellowship with God again placed back on
[59:16] speaking
[59:17] terms it was about changing
[59:21] Natures because I love this see in the
[59:25] same way that a Kinsman had to be kin in
[59:28] order to pay the debt we had to become
[59:31] his nature in order to have fellowship
[59:33] and be United with him see it wasn't
[59:36] just his nature that was changed he
[59:39] became man so that he could pay our debt
[59:43] so that our nature could be changed so
[59:46] that we could be United with him our
[59:49] Nature has to be changed so that there
[59:51] can be a uniting so there can be a
[59:53] marriage Hallelujah it was about a bride
[59:55] all the time it was about you all the
[59:58] time oh I'm a nobody nope it was all
[1:00:01] about you I don't know if I'm going to
[1:00:02] make it you're the one it's all for it's
[1:00:05] your ceremony it's your wedding supper
[1:00:08] he did it so your nature could be change
[1:00:10] that you could be United with
[1:00:15] him and for a while that first church
[1:00:19] lived and overcame from that
[1:00:23] place
[1:00:26] they not only preached the new birth
[1:00:28] they achieved the new
[1:00:29] birth they fellowshipped with God he led
[1:00:33] them he provided for them they were
[1:00:36] perfectly in harmony with god brother
[1:00:39] Bram says the world was almost
[1:00:42] christianized in one decade with one
[1:00:45] round of
[1:00:46] disciples and I read that and I thought
[1:00:49] about I thought about when God put Adam
[1:00:51] in the garden he said subdue
[1:00:53] it these were men going out to
[1:00:56] subdue they were operating under the
[1:00:58] same commission that Adam was we're
[1:01:00] going to go out and take this Earth back
[1:01:02] this Earth we're going to get men and
[1:01:04] women we're going to get them to conquer
[1:01:05] this Earth they're going to subdue it
[1:01:07] and they're going to get filled with the
[1:01:08] spirit and they were on a
[1:01:10] mission they had been commissioned and
[1:01:12] they were going out subduing just like
[1:01:15] Adam and and they operated in the
[1:01:18] faith well brother Aon you didn't say
[1:01:20] they operated in faith no they operated
[1:01:22] in the faith
[1:01:26] what is the faith it's the faith of
[1:01:30] God it was pure faith it was
[1:01:34] unadulterated Faith that's right Faith
[1:01:37] just like God had used when he created
[1:01:40] the
[1:01:42] world Faith yeah God had faith God used
[1:01:50] faith brother Brown says by the same
[1:01:53] sense God spoke when there was nothing
[1:01:56] what is that sense that super sense is
[1:01:59] God the faith of God in you the part of
[1:02:02] God that comes into you gives you the
[1:02:05] super sense by that same super sense God
[1:02:08] framed the world together with things
[1:02:10] which was not and did not appear he
[1:02:13] spoke his word and believed his word and
[1:02:17] a world shook into existence Glory
[1:02:21] that's that's incredible to me why you
[1:02:24] think that brother Brandon would say
[1:02:25] that if there wasn't a law against it
[1:02:27] you could create a world and go live on
[1:02:29] it because what faith are we operating
[1:02:31] by the faith the same Faith that's
[1:02:35] already spoke a world into existence
[1:02:37] once it's already happened
[1:02:40] once this is the faith they were
[1:02:42] operating by pure Faith amen it it was
[1:02:45] the same faith that that that Adam had
[1:02:47] before the fall Adam spoke and it
[1:02:50] happened how did that happen because he
[1:02:53] believed he he had no reason not to
[1:02:55] believe fear hadn't entered in doubt
[1:02:56] hadn't entered in he just spoke and
[1:02:58] expected it to be so which is how we're
[1:03:01] taught that we are to operate just speak
[1:03:04] and believe it speak the word and go
[1:03:06] forward well that's what Adam did he was
[1:03:08] operating by the same faith that had
[1:03:10] created the garden now he dressed the
[1:03:12] garden he calmed the winds he moved
[1:03:15] trees he controlled all nature he
[1:03:17] controlled all animals because there was
[1:03:19] no doubt there was God's word and
[1:03:23] nothing else that's right what a place
[1:03:25] to be in tonight can we get ourselves to
[1:03:28] that place to where there's God's word
[1:03:30] and nothing
[1:03:31] else there's God's word that says I'm
[1:03:34] Healed there's God's word that said my
[1:03:36] offspring are going to be there there's
[1:03:38] God's word that says he was going to
[1:03:40] have a church without spot or wrinkle it
[1:03:42] was God's word that said to the
[1:03:43] Overcomers of the age will I grant to
[1:03:45] sit with me on my right hand it's God's
[1:03:48] word it's God's word and nothing else
[1:03:51] well I don't know I do just look to
[1:03:53] God's word tonight amen
[1:03:55] amen there was God's word and nothing
[1:03:58] else because you can't fellowship with
[1:04:01] God and doubt
[1:04:05] him you cannot fellowship with God and
[1:04:08] doubt him you can't have Fellowship
[1:04:11] without faith you can't please God
[1:04:14] without
[1:04:16] faith think about it it's impossible to
[1:04:18] please God without faith then he says
[1:04:20] when I return will I find faith and then
[1:04:23] he sends a message to turn our hearts
[1:04:25] back to the faith it's very important it
[1:04:28] it almost it almost tickles me but it
[1:04:30] almost frustrates me when people are
[1:04:31] like well that guy simple he preaches
[1:04:33] faith I'm like it gets no deeper than
[1:04:36] faith it gets no deeper than
[1:04:41] Faith just going to leave that there
[1:04:44] because somewhere it got twisted up in
[1:04:46] people's mind that that faith is simple
[1:04:48] preaching listen if that's what it takes
[1:04:50] to please God it don't get no deeper
[1:04:52] than that cuz that's all I want to do is
[1:04:54] please God I want the faith of God
[1:04:57] living in me overcoming in me I don't
[1:04:59] want to doubt God lord I believe help
[1:05:01] thou my unbelief I want faith I'm not
[1:05:05] going to go in a Rapture without faith I
[1:05:07] got to have perfect Faith this message
[1:05:09] came to restore the faith oh but these
[1:05:12] Mysteries and this and this and it's so
[1:05:14] deep and it is but why did the message
[1:05:17] come why were the Mysteries revealed why
[1:05:20] was the message
[1:05:21] Vindicated
[1:05:23] faith
[1:05:24] all your depth and your Mysteries and
[1:05:28] your spiritual riddles lead back
[1:05:30] to
[1:05:34] Faith that's the depth of it it's all
[1:05:37] about returning to the faith and this
[1:05:40] first church was operating in the faith
[1:05:42] of God because
[1:05:45] because they had been born
[1:05:48] again they were operating in faith
[1:05:51] because they had been born again they
[1:05:53] had receed received the new birth and
[1:05:55] now they were speaking like Adam spoke
[1:05:57] before the fall nature was subject
[1:06:01] demons were subject the body was subject
[1:06:04] the word was coming forth in power there
[1:06:07] were
[1:06:09] fruits now we're going to stop there for
[1:06:11] a second because if you got the new
[1:06:13] birth like they got the new birth there
[1:06:16] will be a harvest of
[1:06:18] fruits and it won't be a onetime harvest
[1:06:20] because it ain't a one-time thing the
[1:06:22] Holy Spirit ain't coming and going
[1:06:25] it's indwelling and so it should be
[1:06:27] producing fruits of the spirit there
[1:06:30] will be a harvest there was fruits if we
[1:06:33] get what they got will produce the same
[1:06:37] things are you talking about the
[1:06:39] Miracles and all that absolutely I am
[1:06:41] but I'm talking about the overcoming
[1:06:42] life that's right I'm talking about
[1:06:44] Victory to live above sin that's right
[1:06:47] and then all the other things that go
[1:06:49] with it the Miracles and the signs and
[1:06:51] the Wonders yes that'll be there too
[1:06:53] it's it's part of it they were no longer
[1:06:57] coming and going in and out of the
[1:06:59] presence of God now based off the
[1:07:02] sacrifice of a bull or a goat they
[1:07:06] didn't come in and then leave out from
[1:07:07] underneath that but now that they had
[1:07:10] stepped into the shikina
[1:07:12] glory amen and and that's where you have
[1:07:14] to go tonight that's where when you step
[1:07:17] in there the world is shut off from you
[1:07:20] when you step in there that that's where
[1:07:21] you find peace when you step in there
[1:07:24] that's where you find Victory when you
[1:07:26] enter into the holy of holies and you
[1:07:28] aren't just out there eating Mana in the
[1:07:30] outer
[1:07:31] courts come on
[1:07:33] somebody you can't just stay out there
[1:07:35] eating mana and that sure it's real
[1:07:38] Mana sure it's real blessings out there
[1:07:40] in the outer courts those are real
[1:07:42] things but if you aren't sealed Away by
[1:07:44] the new birth that Mana will
[1:07:50] spoil listen I'm going go
[1:07:52] here for just a second if mana's
[1:07:56] blessings and we believe in blessings
[1:07:59] amen and if jumping and shouting and
[1:08:02] dancing because the spirit fell upon us
[1:08:03] and those things that accompany that are
[1:08:06] blessings then we want
[1:08:08] them but don't just be satisfied by
[1:08:11] those
[1:08:12] blessings because you can still have
[1:08:15] that Mana in the holy of holies the Mana
[1:08:19] is still there but it's Mana that never
[1:08:21] spools you won't jump and dance on
[1:08:23] Sunday be defeated on Monday you won't
[1:08:25] jump and Shout on Wednesday and then be
[1:08:27] a sinner on Thursday but you'll go into
[1:08:29] the Holy Ghost to the holy of holies and
[1:08:32] the world will be sealed out your life
[1:08:34] will be sealed you'll be an overcomer
[1:08:36] then you can dance like you've never
[1:08:38] danced before you can shout like you've
[1:08:40] never shouted before you will have
[1:08:43] Victory real victory in the shakina
[1:08:51] glory when you're living in the presence
[1:08:53] of of God born again sealed by the
[1:08:55] spirit then you're living in a different
[1:08:58] atmosphere
[1:09:09] amen I can't just hang mine on this neat
[1:09:12] little hook because it hangs out on the
[1:09:13] floor and then I'll end up tripping and
[1:09:15] walking all over
[1:09:20] it but you're living in a different
[1:09:22] atmosphere then
[1:09:27] Amen in that
[1:09:29] atmosphere an old Dead stick began to
[1:09:32] produce
[1:09:33] almonds think about it it began to Pro
[1:09:37] produce What It produced at the
[1:09:40] beginning back when it was connected to
[1:09:43] the Life Source before it was cut off
[1:09:46] before it became a a staff before it had
[1:09:49] been dead for 50 years it went back past
[1:09:51] all that and began to prod produc What
[1:09:54] It produced at the beginning amen it
[1:09:57] began to bring forth life that's what
[1:09:59] happens to a Believer when they're born
[1:10:02] again your life may look dead it may
[1:10:05] look dried up but once it lays in the
[1:10:07] atmosphere that life begins to Blossom
[1:10:10] and then from that Blossom comes fruits
[1:10:12] and then you'll start to produce the
[1:10:14] very light that you were supposed to
[1:10:16] produce all along when God formed you
[1:10:19] when God made you he said here's the
[1:10:21] life I want and for years it was dead
[1:10:23] for years it didn't produce but then you
[1:10:25] get it in the holy of holies and it lays
[1:10:27] in that atmosphere and it blossoms and
[1:10:30] it grows and it gives the fruit that you
[1:10:32] were always meant to
[1:10:34] produce Hallelujah that life becomes
[1:10:38] fruitful you are a son and daughter of
[1:10:41] God and you begin to yield the fruits of
[1:10:43] the spirit but you can't yield those
[1:10:46] fruits in the outer Court it can't just
[1:10:49] be on the Flesh and on the
[1:10:52] spirit listen I enjoy feeling it on my
[1:10:56] flesh I enjoy it on my spirit but that
[1:11:00] ain't what SEALs you that ain't what
[1:11:03] changes
[1:11:04] you let it get down on the inside go
[1:11:08] into the holy of holies and let the holy
[1:11:10] and holies get on the inside of you and
[1:11:13] let your life be changed brother Brown
[1:11:15] says that's the way you see people oh
[1:11:17] they say we're eating the good Mana of
[1:11:19] God that's right but where are they
[1:11:22] living they're living out there eating
[1:11:25] it in an atmosphere that they should not
[1:11:27] eat it
[1:11:29] in but when he once walked in behind
[1:11:31] that holiest of holies walked into the
[1:11:34] presence of God and the veil falls
[1:11:35] behind him there's a lot there's a pot
[1:11:38] of Mana where he can eat it every day
[1:11:40] and every hour of the week There's where
[1:11:42] he's living in the shikina glory where
[1:11:45] in the interlock wings of the cherubims
[1:11:47] the great Pillar of Fire and the Shina
[1:11:49] rested there and he's living under there
[1:11:51] he can't be nothing but a real genuine
[1:11:55] Christian anytime and then he just says
[1:11:59] atmosphere
[1:12:00] atmosphere you become a real genuine
[1:12:04] Christian yes there's Mana that falls in
[1:12:06] the outer courts but we have to go
[1:12:09] inside behind the inner Veil into the
[1:12:11] holy of holies because out there you're
[1:12:13] up and
[1:12:14] down out there you're in and out you're
[1:12:17] shook by this and you're shook by that
[1:12:20] this preacher says this but this
[1:12:21] preacher says that so now I'm tore up
[1:12:22] and and I'm Shook and and I'm living in
[1:12:24] the outer courts and when you're there
[1:12:26] you're subject to the winds and the
[1:12:28] storms and this person said this to me
[1:12:31] and I'm hurt we all get
[1:12:34] hurt we all get hurt I'm not questioning
[1:12:38] your hurt right I've never questioned
[1:12:41] someone's offense we all get
[1:12:46] offended let's be real for a minute all
[1:12:49] of us have times where people get on our
[1:12:52] nerves
[1:12:54] you can see
[1:12:57] oh there'll be no lies here
[1:13:03] tonight we all go through that but we're
[1:13:07] in the holy of holies so that's just the
[1:13:09] wind and it don't bother us that's just
[1:13:11] a little storm outside and it don't
[1:13:13] bother us cuz I'm in here in the holy of
[1:13:15] holies and my life is blooming and my
[1:13:17] life is fruitful and I'm overcoming and
[1:13:20] the god of Heaven's on the inside of me
[1:13:22] and that may hurt me but press on and
[1:13:24] that may bother me but I press on and
[1:13:26] that may get on my nerves but I press on
[1:13:28] and I come together and we worship
[1:13:30] together and we praise together we
[1:13:32] overcome together we're Victorious
[1:13:34] together we're going to Rapture
[1:13:36] together if you get in the holy of
[1:13:39] holies where those things don't move you
[1:13:46] anymore go inside and get born
[1:13:49] again and let the shakina cut off all
[1:13:52] the ne negative
[1:13:54] atmospheres cut you off from your own
[1:13:56] thinking cut you off from your
[1:13:58] reasoning and and and live in a place to
[1:14:02] where the attacks don't ruin your
[1:14:04] atmosphere but your atmosphere repels
[1:14:06] the
[1:14:11] attacks listen it shouldn't bring you
[1:14:14] down every time something comes against
[1:14:17] you or somebody
[1:14:18] offends because it's going to happen all
[1:14:21] the time if that's how we we're going to
[1:14:23] be upset a
[1:14:25] lot but the atmosphere you live in
[1:14:28] should repel those things away from you
[1:14:31] like water off of a duck's bag
[1:14:36] amen
[1:14:38] Christians with the Life of Christ on
[1:14:40] the
[1:14:41] inside displaying that life to the World
[1:14:45] by bearing the fruit of the
[1:14:48] spirit not just by saying I go to church
[1:14:53] you you should come check out my church
[1:14:54] oh I didn't know you went to church well
[1:14:56] that's a red
[1:14:59] flag you should be bearing the fruit of
[1:15:01] the
[1:15:02] spirit you should be testifying to the
[1:15:04] world that there's a living God by The
[1:15:06] Works that I do shall you do also by the
[1:15:09] atmosphere of a holy God surrounding
[1:15:11] your life a life overflowing with joy a
[1:15:14] life overflowing with peace a life
[1:15:16] overflowing with
[1:15:18] gentleness you can't live your life in a
[1:15:21] negative atmosphere and then walk around
[1:15:23] talking about the token life on the
[1:15:27] inside those things don't go together no
[1:15:31] come on guys I'm I'm real I I know we
[1:15:34] have bad
[1:15:36] days we're not always going to
[1:15:43] be that's not how it always is but you
[1:15:46] shouldn't live in this
[1:15:48] place you shouldn't live in a an
[1:15:51] atmosphere of negativity live in an
[1:15:53] atmosphere of the wowy wowy Woos and woe
[1:15:55] is me and and I can't believe this
[1:15:57] happened to me and I've got the worst
[1:15:59] luck and I've got this and and nobody
[1:16:02] listen I I'm miserable talking about
[1:16:05] it that don't I had to fight off
[1:16:08] depression there for a second like no
[1:16:10] devil no I can't live like that because
[1:16:13] in spite of all that I know I'm a Child
[1:16:15] of God it's a bad day but he died for me
[1:16:18] it's a bad day but he gave me the Holy
[1:16:20] Ghost it's a bad day but he sent a
[1:16:22] message it's a bad day but he healed my
[1:16:25] body I'm having a bad day but me and my
[1:16:28] offspring are going to be there what do
[1:16:30] I have to be S
[1:16:32] [Applause]
[1:16:35] about what are you
[1:16:38] producing does your atmosphere bring
[1:16:41] peace or is every time you come around
[1:16:43] there's fussing and
[1:16:45] fighting and it's always filled with
[1:16:50] drama listen it's like this
[1:16:54] if everywhere you go it stinks you need
[1:16:56] to check your
[1:17:06] shoe man every time around them people
[1:17:08] they're just fussing and fight then I go
[1:17:10] over here and they're fuss I can't find
[1:17:11] nobody getting along hello yeah there's
[1:17:16] one common
[1:17:17] denominator well it's just always drama
[1:17:20] is it funny I've said this before but
[1:17:22] there's something people that know about
[1:17:24] all the drama and there's literally
[1:17:25] people in this church that don't have
[1:17:28] the first clue about any drama that's
[1:17:31] ever gone on here you know why they
[1:17:34] don't feed on
[1:17:36] it they don't like it they don't want it
[1:17:40] and so they don't even know about it
[1:17:42] because they choose not to be a part of
[1:17:43] it drama in your life is a
[1:17:52] choice
[1:17:54] check your
[1:17:55] atmosphere check where you're living at
[1:17:58] because if you're living in that
[1:17:59] Heavenly atmosphere of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:01] born of the spirit your life will Bloom
[1:18:04] and bring forth fruits of the spirit not
[1:18:06] fruits of division not fruits of Gossip
[1:18:09] not fruits of doubt and unbelief fruits
[1:18:11] of negativity because those are fruits
[1:18:13] of the
[1:18:15] curse all those fruits come from the
[1:18:17] curse and they're not from the new
[1:18:19] birth but the but the first church age
[1:18:21] was born again and were producing fruits
[1:18:24] because they were born again Faith was
[1:18:27] restored Fellowship was restored they
[1:18:29] were back like Adam and Eve again it was
[1:18:31] a love affair between them and God God
[1:18:34] and his church or should I say it was
[1:18:37] God and his
[1:18:41] bride that first church was to be the
[1:18:45] bride brother Brenham says the birth of
[1:18:48] the church was at Pentecost and as the
[1:18:51] first Adam was given a bride fresh from
[1:18:53] the hand of God undefiled for a brief
[1:18:56] span so was Christ the last Adam given a
[1:19:00] bride pure and fresh at Pentecost and
[1:19:03] she remained separate and undefiled for
[1:19:06] some time he says in the Harvest time
[1:19:09] now the second Eve watch her she was
[1:19:11] created a new like he was at the day of
[1:19:14] Pentecost filled with the spirit fed by
[1:19:16] the word amen she was to be Christ's
[1:19:20] bride he says she was born on the day of
[1:19:23] Pentecost she was Spirit-filled and she
[1:19:26] was word
[1:19:28] fed that was to be the bride and for a
[1:19:31] time just like Eve she remains pure and
[1:19:33] and for a time once again there's
[1:19:35] Fellowship through the new
[1:19:37] birth I want you to understand that
[1:19:39] without the new birth you are not in
[1:19:42] fellowship with
[1:19:45] God through the new birth there was
[1:19:48] Fellowship those that were being added
[1:19:50] each and every day weren't joining they
[1:19:52] were were being born right they were
[1:19:55] being born into it Natures were being
[1:19:58] changed Faith was being restored
[1:20:00] Fellowship restored and Paul knew
[1:20:02] exactly what was going on he recognized
[1:20:05] the significance of it all this wasn't
[1:20:07] just a movement this wasn't just a
[1:20:09] religion this just was wasn't just a
[1:20:11] church this was a bride for
[1:20:14] Christ and looking back he recognizes
[1:20:17] what had been restored and where they
[1:20:19] stood and he knew what had happened in
[1:20:21] Eden and he feared that once again Satan
[1:20:24] would try to defile the bride and so he
[1:20:27] says in 2 Corinthians 11: 2 we'll read
[1:20:29] through verse 4 I am jealous over you
[1:20:32] with Godly jealousy for I have espoused
[1:20:36] you to one husband that I may present
[1:20:39] you as a chased virgin to
[1:20:42] Christ but I
[1:20:44] fear lest by any means as the serpent
[1:20:47] beguiled Eve through his subtlety so
[1:20:49] your mind should be corrupted from the
[1:20:51] Simplicity that is in Christ for if he
[1:20:53] that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom
[1:20:55] we have not preached or if you receive
[1:20:57] another Spirit which you have not
[1:20:59] received or another gospel which you
[1:21:00] have not accepted ye might well bear
[1:21:04] with him now that last line there what
[1:21:07] does that
[1:21:08] mean it means you happily put up with
[1:21:11] whatever anyone tells you even if they
[1:21:14] preach a different Jesus than the one we
[1:21:16] preach he's like I'm worried about
[1:21:19] you because there's all kind of
[1:21:21] doctrines and things going along going
[1:21:24] around in the ranks of the message and
[1:21:26] and we just put up with
[1:21:28] it we just sitting back and gum it down
[1:21:31] he says and I'm worried now think about
[1:21:33] it why' I make that
[1:21:34] parallel if he said that he had espoused
[1:21:37] us to Christ as a virgin and our
[1:21:39] messenger said I preached what Paul
[1:21:42] preached what was he doing for us what
[1:21:45] was his message he was espousing a bride
[1:21:48] for Christ that he could present her as
[1:21:51] a virgin
[1:21:54] listen we're not here to to chop down
[1:21:56] other churches and chop down other
[1:21:57] Ministries no sir we're fighting for the
[1:21:59] same goal but what I am saying is we're
[1:22:01] not supposed to just gum down every
[1:22:03] little thing and accept every little
[1:22:05] Doctrine stay with the message you don't
[1:22:07] want to be deceived stay with the
[1:22:09] message you don't want to be beguiled
[1:22:11] stay with the message stay with what the
[1:22:14] prophet
[1:22:15] said don't run off after this and run
[1:22:17] off after this he said I fear you're
[1:22:19] going to be
[1:22:21] deceived he said Eve the Serpent's
[1:22:24] Whispering again and you're listening
[1:22:28] again he says Eve don't accept anything
[1:22:31] but the word or you're going to be begal
[1:22:34] again and now this second Eve born here
[1:22:36] at Pentecost found herself with the same
[1:22:39] Choice stay with the faith stay with the
[1:22:43] word and remain Pure or listen to the
[1:22:46] LIE of the
[1:22:48] enemy the original Faith think about has
[1:22:51] been restored God God has done marvelous
[1:22:54] things trust and fellowship have been
[1:22:56] restored by the New Birth the Jude
[1:22:58] recognizes what's going on he cries out
[1:23:01] contend for the
[1:23:02] faith we've got the faith this is the
[1:23:05] faith of God contend for it don't lose
[1:23:08] it don't go that way don't listen to
[1:23:10] what they're
[1:23:12] saying but they put up with the false
[1:23:14] teachings and as Paul said they bore
[1:23:17] with them false teachers and soon it
[1:23:18] took
[1:23:19] hold reasoning and man's thinking took
[1:23:22] took the place of faith and that's
[1:23:26] exactly what had happened in the Garden
[1:23:27] of Eden prophet of God says Adam lost
[1:23:30] his inheritance the earth now it passed
[1:23:33] from his hand to the one he sold it to
[1:23:35] Satan he sold his faith in God to
[1:23:40] Satan's reasonings therefore his eternal
[1:23:43] life his right to the Tree of Life his
[1:23:45] right to the Earth belonged to him and
[1:23:48] he forfeited every bit to the hands of
[1:23:50] Satan he passed it from his hand to
[1:23:54] Satan he says in the breach the title
[1:23:56] deed to eternal life Abstract title deed
[1:23:59] to eternal life when Adam forfeited for
[1:24:02] wisdom instead of faith it went back to
[1:24:04] the hands of the
[1:24:08] owner so the first Eve listened and fell
[1:24:12] and sold their
[1:24:14] faith she hybridized the faith that's
[1:24:17] what brother brandham would say she
[1:24:18] doubted what God Said and so she took
[1:24:20] some of what God Said and she took some
[1:24:22] of what the devil said she mixed it all
[1:24:24] together she said here it
[1:24:27] is she lost the title they lost
[1:24:31] fellowship and now the second e Falls
[1:24:33] once again because Satan comes and
[1:24:36] begals and this church chooses wisdom
[1:24:39] and knowledge and the leadership of man
[1:24:42] and the prophet of God said naturally
[1:24:44] fail in Eden by listening to Satan's
[1:24:46] reasoning against God's word that's how
[1:24:49] she fell all right sir she fail because
[1:24:51] she did that spiritual leave now that's
[1:24:53] the church Christ's bride she fell not
[1:24:56] in Eden but in Rome see at the NAIA
[1:25:00] Council when she rejected that
[1:25:03] Pentecostal
[1:25:05] Church you have another eeve
[1:25:08] fallen and just like that Eve the church
[1:25:11] hybridized the faith just like Eve
[1:25:13] natural had done in the garden and once
[1:25:16] again trust is
[1:25:19] broken the faith was mixed with fears
[1:25:22] and frustrations and failures and
[1:25:24] theology mixed in with with with
[1:25:27] paganism and the church mixed it all
[1:25:30] together just like Eve did and said here
[1:25:32] it is this is the
[1:25:34] faith this is it and just as before when
[1:25:38] the world went into a chaos the church
[1:25:41] goes into
[1:25:42] chaos the church goes into idolatry and
[1:25:45] there's confusion and fear and there's
[1:25:47] an atmosphere of Doubt around the church
[1:25:50] listen there was no way that church
[1:25:52] could could
[1:25:53] Rapture there was no way there could be
[1:25:56] a Rapture Satan Twisted it up and it
[1:25:57] fell further and further out of
[1:25:59] Fellowship further and further away from
[1:26:01] the New Birth further and further away
[1:26:04] from the faith that would be
[1:26:06] needed how could there be a marriage if
[1:26:08] there couldn't even be
[1:26:11] Fellowship you couldn't have a marriage
[1:26:13] if you couldn't even have Fellowship
[1:26:15] Church we were in a mess we were in a
[1:26:18] bad spot Eve was beg galed and she was
[1:26:21] being drugged further and further away
[1:26:23] from Eden all the time beg galed and
[1:26:25] everything was lost beg galed and
[1:26:28] faithless headed the wrong direction all
[1:26:31] the time what brother Bram say it was
[1:26:32] just a big terrific mass of something
[1:26:38] lost and the spirit of God
[1:26:40] moved Hallelujah and he said I will
[1:26:44] restore and the spirit of God moved and
[1:26:47] and out comes justification and the
[1:26:49] spirit of God moves and he says I'm
[1:26:51] going to bring them back in into
[1:26:52] Fellowship I'm going to turn them back
[1:26:54] to the original oh my all it takes
[1:26:57] tonight is for the spirit of God to move
[1:26:59] and atmospheres began to change the
[1:27:02] spirit of God moved and the just shall
[1:27:03] live by faith the spirit of God moved
[1:27:06] and all of a sudden you had
[1:27:08] sanctification the spirit of God moved
[1:27:10] and Along Comes Aza Street and the
[1:27:12] restoration of the gifts and what did it
[1:27:14] do it brought order again just like he
[1:27:18] had in the Garden of
[1:27:20] Eden and yet there still couldn't be
[1:27:23] Fellowship why because it was still
[1:27:25] hybrid those were truths but there were
[1:27:27] still ideas of mans and dogmas mixed
[1:27:30] into those truths it was still
[1:27:33] hybridized there was still claims
[1:27:35] against the church you know that they
[1:27:37] had enough light to to know that he was
[1:27:39] the son of God they had enough light to
[1:27:42] claim him as their personal savior but
[1:27:44] false teaching still had the church
[1:27:46] bound up the faith still hadn't turned
[1:27:49] back to the original but he wasn't done
[1:27:53] he wasn't done restoring he said I will
[1:27:55] restore all he wasn't just going to stop
[1:27:58] halfway he said I'm not going to stop
[1:28:00] until this bride tree is restored all
[1:28:03] the way back up into its complete glory
[1:28:05] amen he wasn't done because there was
[1:28:07] still a message coming there was a
[1:28:09] message coming in this day to restore
[1:28:11] Fellowship to restore Bible truth to
[1:28:14] restore the doctrine of the new birth to
[1:28:16] get us in line that we could have
[1:28:17] Fellowship
[1:28:20] again there was supposed to be light at
[1:28:23] the evening time there was going to be a
[1:28:25] called out group who once again could
[1:28:27] fellowship with God through the new
[1:28:29] birth there was supposed to be a Rapture
[1:28:32] church he hasn't
[1:28:33] forgotten don't think for a minute he's
[1:28:36] forgotten us here in
[1:28:37] leosia listen the wheels may be grinding
[1:28:40] slow but they grind sure there will be a
[1:28:43] Rapture you will be a part of it he said
[1:28:46] he'd send Elijah and he did it he said
[1:28:48] he'd turn our hearts and he did it he
[1:28:50] said there'll be Overcomers and there
[1:28:52] will be he hasn't forgot us here
[1:28:57] hallelujah but the atmosphere had to be
[1:29:00] right for a
[1:29:02] Rapture because atmosphere is
[1:29:05] produce and the atmosphere that was on
[1:29:07] the church couldn't produce a
[1:29:09] Rapture the bride had to be turned away
[1:29:11] from doubt the bride had to be turned
[1:29:14] away from fear and isms and and these
[1:29:16] little doctrines and and Theology and
[1:29:18] Catholic
[1:29:20] doas and the message came to change the
[1:29:23] atmosphere around the
[1:29:24] church and it brought us back to a place
[1:29:28] of believing again what he have to do
[1:29:31] with Sarah he had to get her attitude
[1:29:33] right he had to get the atmosphere right
[1:29:36] he had to get her believing again so she
[1:29:38] could receive the promised son so she
[1:29:40] could receive a body change it had to
[1:29:42] turn us back to Faith again back to a
[1:29:46] place where a people operated by the
[1:29:49] word a people lived by the word a people
[1:29:51] people moveed by the word and it did
[1:29:54] that and how did it do that it did that
[1:29:57] by just like the first church it brought
[1:29:59] us back to the new
[1:30:01] birth that's how it brought us back to
[1:30:04] that place again it brought us back to
[1:30:05] the new birth for without the new birth
[1:30:07] there can be no fellowship with God we
[1:30:11] don't we we don't I I know there can be
[1:30:14] no Fellowship without blood but we don't
[1:30:17] have the literal blood today we have the
[1:30:20] life of the blood
[1:30:22] so there can be no Fellowship unless
[1:30:24] it's under the life of that blood amen
[1:30:27] it's the Holy
[1:30:29] Ghost and when you get in there and it
[1:30:31] gets in then and it gets on the inside
[1:30:33] of you then you can have
[1:30:35] Fellowship this is the age of restored
[1:30:38] Fellowship this is a message of restored
[1:30:41] Fellowship this is the message that
[1:30:43] brings us not part of the way back that
[1:30:45] doesn't restore a partial truth or a
[1:30:47] little truth this is the message that
[1:30:49] ties it all together this is the message
[1:30:52] that brings us back into an atmosphere
[1:30:54] of Fellowship amen now we can speak now
[1:30:58] we can Fellowship now we can talk to God
[1:31:02] listen I'm thankful for Luther I'm
[1:31:04] thankful for Wesley I'm thankful for
[1:31:06] isua but none of them allowed you to
[1:31:10] again openly fellowship with
[1:31:13] God because they operated in
[1:31:17] portions they operated with claims
[1:31:20] against them listen it's it's I I want
[1:31:23] to drive this
[1:31:24] home it's not a knock on other
[1:31:29] ages it's not looking down on them they
[1:31:32] operated in the fullness of what they
[1:31:34] were
[1:31:35] given they went as far as they could go
[1:31:38] in the light God gave them they operated
[1:31:42] in the fullness of the message of their
[1:31:44] day but the fullness of all of it wasn't
[1:31:47] given to them we can't look down our
[1:31:50] noses because more has been given in
[1:31:52] this age they fulfilled all they could
[1:31:55] they did their part but Fellowship could
[1:31:58] not be fully restored because the Holy
[1:32:00] Ghost was not given in its
[1:32:05] fullness you must have the new birth to
[1:32:10] Fellowship I'm going to go through some
[1:32:12] of these
[1:32:13] quotes he says on the inside of the
[1:32:15] holiest of holies one man once a year
[1:32:17] went in there but when our real
[1:32:19] sacrifice Jesus Christ died at Calvary
[1:32:21] he rent the veil in two making the way
[1:32:23] with his own blood that whosoever will
[1:32:26] can come into the shika glory in the
[1:32:28] presence of the Holy Ghost and be filled
[1:32:29] with the power of Pentecost as they did
[1:32:32] after the veil had been torn down yellow
[1:32:34] brown black white male female Gentile
[1:32:36] Jew whosoever will let him come and
[1:32:39] drink from the Fountain of the Lord when
[1:32:41] they come into that shakana Glory
[1:32:43] Anointed with the Holy Spirit then they
[1:32:45] got fellowship with God again then their
[1:32:48] sons and daughters of God no wonder we
[1:32:51] sto at the water of separation and try
[1:32:53] to Fellowship from there you can't do it
[1:32:56] you stop by the side of the blood
[1:32:58] without entering into the holy place you
[1:33:01] are not in
[1:33:04] Fellowship you must go all the way he
[1:33:07] says justification is Waters of
[1:33:09] separation and sanctification cleansing
[1:33:12] of our soul and when we go into the
[1:33:14] holiest of holies where the Shak kind of
[1:33:15] Glory is by that one Spirit we are
[1:33:18] baptized into that one body and have
[1:33:20] fellowship with God Amen you'll never be
[1:33:22] able to do it by the Waters of
[1:33:24] Separation alone so justification
[1:33:28] doesn't do it he said now he's not in
[1:33:31] Fellowship yet yet he's separated from
[1:33:34] his sins but he's not in Fellowship yet
[1:33:38] look sanctification won't do it he says
[1:33:41] that brings you Methodist up all right
[1:33:43] for your sanctification still not in
[1:33:45] Fellowship still don't do it but when
[1:33:48] they went he was inside the building but
[1:33:50] you could fellowship with with one
[1:33:51] another greet one another but no
[1:33:54] fellowship with God
[1:33:59] yet it doesn't Grant full
[1:34:02] access there couldn't be restored
[1:34:04] Fellowship until this
[1:34:08] message there couldn't be restored to
[1:34:10] the atmosphere like they had in Eden on
[1:34:13] speaking terms until this
[1:34:16] message under those things it wouldn't
[1:34:19] allow a Rapture because in that
[1:34:21] condition you can't return to open
[1:34:23] face-to-face Fellowship Amen brother
[1:34:26] brandham says that is the only place of
[1:34:30] Fellowship in those ages they couldn't
[1:34:33] return all the way back why well simple
[1:34:36] they didn't have the word restored the
[1:34:39] book was still a sealed book but in this
[1:34:43] age listen how many people have long to
[1:34:46] sit where you're sitting in this age
[1:34:48] where the Books open and they can return
[1:34:50] to a condition a fellowship with God
[1:34:52] once again where he hears them and he
[1:34:55] speaks back and you can operate in that
[1:34:58] place where all your rights are restored
[1:35:00] and you have the right to look Satan in
[1:35:02] the eye and you can speak the word take
[1:35:04] your hands off my property back off of
[1:35:06] my property give me my promises give me
[1:35:09] my Mountain we stand in that place
[1:35:12] tonight because there's restored
[1:35:14] Fellowship through the Holy
[1:35:16] Ghost In other words under this message
[1:35:19] there is full adoption
[1:35:23] that's what this message is we're not
[1:35:26] operating in a place of a portion and
[1:35:28] therefore we need another
[1:35:30] step no we don't need another
[1:35:33] step this birth is the token and this
[1:35:36] token is the adoption amen amen the Holy
[1:35:40] Ghost as we know it the new birth like
[1:35:43] they received at the day of Pentecost
[1:35:45] wasn't available in previous stages of
[1:35:50] restoration
[1:35:52] not as we know
[1:35:53] it not exactly like they had it at
[1:35:56] Pentecost it hasn't returned like that
[1:35:58] until
[1:36:00] now and in the previous stages of
[1:36:03] restoration it wasn't available that
[1:36:05] doesn't mean that they didn't have the
[1:36:06] Holy Ghost in the portion that it was
[1:36:09] given that that doesn't that doesn't
[1:36:11] mean that that they didn't attain the
[1:36:13] fullness of what was
[1:36:15] available but if they got that under
[1:36:17] Wesley or they got that under isua there
[1:36:20] was always more in front of them not yet
[1:36:22] revealed there was always more that they
[1:36:25] needed to press towards there was more
[1:36:28] steps to go
[1:36:29] to because it wasn't yet open it wasn't
[1:36:32] yet available so as a people they were
[1:36:35] not restored to speaking
[1:36:40] terms but
[1:36:43] you you tonight the book is totally open
[1:36:47] you have the right to stand in
[1:36:49] fellowship with God you have the right
[1:36:50] to put your foot on the neck of the
[1:36:52] devil there is no claim on your life
[1:36:54] there is no condemnation on your life
[1:36:56] this message came and it told you where
[1:36:58] you came from it told you where you were
[1:37:00] going and not only that it told us where
[1:37:02] we were and it told us what rights we
[1:37:04] had the book is open we are restored
[1:37:07] back to a place of fellowship tonight
[1:37:11] Hallelujah the atmosphere changed when
[1:37:14] the seals were
[1:37:18] open B going to wrap this up but bear
[1:37:21] with me for about 5 minutes the
[1:37:23] atmosphere changed when the seals were
[1:37:26] open listen there's there's nothing to
[1:37:29] me that points to Fellowship being
[1:37:32] completely restored and relationship
[1:37:34] being restored more than God sharing his
[1:37:38] secrets with
[1:37:39] us think about it I couldn't tell others
[1:37:44] but I'm going to tell you all right I
[1:37:47] couldn't Fellowship about this with them
[1:37:49] but I'm going to tell you I'm telling
[1:37:51] you fellowship's restored communication
[1:37:54] is restored we're back on speaking terms
[1:37:56] and he comes down and he says this is
[1:37:58] why I couldn't show them but I'm showing
[1:38:00] you and there's going to be this portion
[1:38:02] allotted to these people and this
[1:38:03] portion allotted and here's where the
[1:38:04] horse riders went forth and he lays it
[1:38:06] all out it's like a love letter it's his
[1:38:08] love secrets and he draws you in close
[1:38:11] and he says this message has brought you
[1:38:13] back to a place where I can share all of
[1:38:15] this with you I couldn't tell them but I
[1:38:18] can tell you because you're my bride
[1:38:20] you're my wife you're my sweetheart and
[1:38:23] you've been restored to a place of
[1:38:26] fellowship and because of that he begins
[1:38:29] to share all his secrets with you

[1:40:51] the second Adam
[1:40:53] operated why it's a
[1:40:56] restoration and in that restored
[1:40:59] atmosphere there are Sons and Daughters
[1:41:01] operating by faith in the
[1:41:03] word and once again we can speak and it
[1:41:07] will be
[1:41:08] so we can create an atmosphere where
[1:41:11] Satan's not
[1:41:13] welcome listen we're not subject to
[1:41:15] atmospheres we're the creator of
[1:41:17] atmospheres we can create an atmosphere
[1:41:19] where the sick are healed we can create
[1:41:21] an atmosphere of deliverance we can
[1:41:24] create an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:26] sure Satan can still whip up the Seas he
[1:41:29] can still come and cause trials and
[1:41:31] tribulation but when a St a son
[1:41:33] recognizes where he's at and squares his
[1:41:35] shoulders back just like the first Adam
[1:41:38] and just like the second Adam you are
[1:41:40] now in a position you can stand there
[1:41:42] and say peace be still you'll not have
[1:41:44] my children you'll not have my health
[1:41:47] you'll not have my finances I'm standing
[1:41:49] in a restored place in a restored
[1:41:51] atmosphere and I'm on speaking terms
[1:41:53] with God and when I take his word on my
[1:41:55] lips it's the same as deity speaking so
[1:41:58] Satan you go Satan you go you take your
[1:42:03] leave hallelujah we're taking a Rapture

[1:42:19] come then if we can speak the
[1:42:23] word then we have been restored to a
[1:42:25] place of
[1:42:26] fellowship and once we are in

[1:42:36] relationship there can be a
[1:42:39] marriage how close are

[1:42:56] now that you are Jesus Christ the son of
[1:42:59] God I recognize his blood went before me

[1:43:05] miraculous power transforms your life
[1:43:07] and picks you up and brings you into the
[1:43:10] inside of the veil and there you have
[1:43:13] fellowship with God and commune with him
[1:43:16] as Adam did in the beginning of the
[1:43:19] Garden of Eden
[1:43:22] and God looks down in this last
[1:43:25] day and he sees people operating again
[1:43:29] like Adam
