[56:34] him
[56:35] as he went home to be with the Lord and
[56:37] they come down to the river no doubt to
[56:41] to greet him
[56:43] and to welcome him
[56:45] he hadn't got through shaking hands he
[56:47] out in the hugging necks rejoicing as he
[56:51] looks around at the Wonders
[56:54] others come around to show him the
[56:56] Wonders
[56:57] of the beauties that are there
[57:01] strolling all over heaven with him
[57:03] showing him to different sites
[57:07] we never know when our last moment will
[57:10] come
[57:12] but I'm thankful for this
[57:14] a man that I
[57:16] am known for probably 40 50 years
[57:22] struggled a long life's way and
[57:25] has stumbles
[57:27] can never really get a grip that Jesus
[57:30] loved him
[57:31] he can believe in God
[57:34] he could believe that
[57:37] that the message that God had sent was
[57:39] true and was Realty to him but he just
[57:43] couldn't get it to accept it for himself
[57:48] back in about 1998
[57:54] somewhere along that time that little
[57:57] birthday celebration
[57:59] versus would be his daughter-in-law my
[58:02] daughter Lydia
[58:05] he would sit down on the couch there and
[58:07] we'd visit for a while and I'd say to
[58:10] him for the Ross
[58:13] you know there is hope for you you
[58:16] haven't crossed the line
[58:18] God's a god rich in Mercy and he'll able
[58:21] to turn your life around
[58:23] and this this is not just for someone
[58:26] else it's for you
[58:29] and it was there
[58:31] that he looked at me kind of in a shock
[58:33] surprise and said really
[58:36] is that right I said yes it's true it's
[58:40] for you too
[58:42] and that day God began to do a work in
[58:44] his life and turned him around and
[58:47] over the events of time
[58:50] just um
[58:52] just some years later
[58:54] I was preaching a sermon called
[58:58] when he came to himself
[59:01] and there
[59:03] to the altar
[59:05] came a big huge man Ross Oglesby and
[59:08] melted altar and gave this life to the
[59:12] Lord that day he came to himself
[59:17] in the last few days and months that
[59:20] he's had
[59:22] where he knew he was going to not be
[59:24] able to stay here in a long time
[59:27] his time was up on Earth
[59:29] God did great things bringing
[59:32] reconciliation and Restoration in his
[59:35] family
[59:36] miraculous taking place
[59:39] God preparing and making the way
[59:43] for reservations on the other side
[59:47] and for a great day where we'll all be
[59:49] restored and
[59:51] and restoration will be complete or
[59:56] we'll all be in new bodies
[1:00:02] today we don't we don't sorrow as those
[1:00:06] who have no hope
[1:00:07] we have hope in the Lord
[1:00:11] and um
[1:00:12] you know he would be able to look at his
[1:00:14] at his son Aaron before he left and say
[1:00:17] son if you quit
[1:00:19] if Alan quits if Amanda quits that the
[1:00:22] whole family quits serving God
[1:00:24] I'm going to go on with God
[1:00:27] you know that that's the thing it
[1:00:30] becomes very personal to you
[1:00:32] it's not about what others think about
[1:00:34] Jesus
[1:00:36] is what do you do with this Jesus called
[1:00:38] Christ
[1:00:41] and there brother Ross took him and put
[1:00:44] him in his heart
[1:00:45] he was on no longer on his hands
[1:00:49] pilate had him on his hands and couldn't
[1:00:50] wash the blood of Jesus off
[1:00:54] but Ross
[1:00:56] had Jesus on his hands
[1:00:58] and he accepted him into his heart
[1:01:01] and we want to thank God for his life
[1:01:03] and his testimony and what he's meant to
[1:01:06] us and to this church his friendship his
[1:01:09] love to his family
[1:01:11] is
[1:01:13] his love to his children his wife and
[1:01:17] all that God is all his friends
[1:01:20] he loves you very deeply
[1:01:22] and we love him
[1:01:24] and he's not dead
[1:01:26] he just crossed the veil of tears and
[1:01:29] sorrow into the land of joys
[1:01:33] so we want to just ask the Lord's
[1:01:35] blessings upon the family they're going
[1:01:38] to be perhaps having a a memorial
[1:01:41] service at a later date
[1:01:43] brother Aaron Oglesby right now as I am
[1:01:47] speaking is probably winding up his
[1:01:48] service there and and
[1:01:51] um Johnson City Tennessee at brother
[1:01:53] Donnie Reagan's he just preached two
[1:01:56] wonderful meetings there for the young
[1:01:58] people and God moved
[1:02:00] tremendous brother Ron Spencer listened
[1:02:02] to it and he said
[1:02:04] man it may not made me want to get saved
[1:02:06] myself
[1:02:09] that's the way it is you know you hear
[1:02:11] the word of God he just moves down on
[1:02:13] the inside of you
[1:02:15] says I want more of you Lord
[1:02:19] and today is brother Aaron would
[1:02:22] Minister his dad made him promise you go
[1:02:24] on
[1:02:25] don't you stay here
[1:02:27] you go and minister to those young
[1:02:29] people and so there as I told him he's
[1:02:33] over there with that cloud of witnesses
[1:02:34] looking on as we continue the battle
[1:02:37] here upon the Earth
[1:02:39] so let's talk to the Lord today and ask
[1:02:42] God's blessings now upon their family
[1:02:58] footprints
[1:03:02] on the sands of time
[1:03:09] Lord we look and see
[1:03:13] the path
[1:03:16] even you said that
[1:03:19] some take a long time even a
[1:03:21] predestinated seed
[1:03:24] sometimes take a long time for the
[1:03:26] recognize their son
[1:03:28] but at some point
[1:03:31] you get it true to them
[1:03:34] you were called you were chosen you were
[1:03:37] ordained for this moment in time and
[1:03:39] place
[1:03:41] Lord we want to thank you for brother
[1:03:42] Ross his testimony
[1:03:45] his love for you we want to thank you
[1:03:48] for the Oglesby family and extended Camp
[1:03:51] family
[1:03:52] Lord I pray that you would bless
[1:03:55] each one in their own way
[1:03:59] sister Linda the children brother Allen
[1:04:02] brother Aaron sister Amanda
[1:04:04] all of their
[1:04:06] [Music]
[1:04:07] daughter-in-laws and son-in-law
[1:04:10] grandchildren bless them in a special
[1:04:13] way today
[1:04:15] Lord a little teardrop of Sorrow comes
[1:04:18] down into our hearts and sometimes rolls
[1:04:21] down our cheeks
[1:04:22] when we think about those who go on
[1:04:25] before us
[1:04:26] one day the last one
[1:04:28] will go
[1:04:31] only to be called back in just moments
[1:04:35] of time
[1:04:37] in the great Resurrection ahead
[1:04:39] we believe it's that close
[1:04:42] We Believe Lord that we're right here on
[1:04:44] the cusp of the the very coming of the
[1:04:48] Lord where we will be gathered to meet
[1:04:50] you in the air
[1:04:51] but first we'll gather with those who
[1:04:53] went on
[1:04:54] what a day of rejoicing that will be
[1:04:58] I pray Lord that you would bless us
[1:05:00] today as we just chinch the armor up a
[1:05:03] little tighter
[1:05:05] and another steps in line maybe it'd be
[1:05:07] one of his grandchildren there's a step
[1:05:09] up there and say here I want to take my
[1:05:11] place in the ranks
[1:05:13] I want to move forward as a Son of God
[1:05:16] and
[1:05:17] and step where my grandfather stood
[1:05:20] believing in the Lord with all his heart
[1:05:22] and carrying this sort of the word
[1:05:25] forward
[1:05:26] pray you'll bless the family blessed by
[1:05:28] the Aaron as he ministers today and
[1:05:31] restore strength to his body
[1:05:33] Satan attacks us in every kind of way
[1:05:36] but you're the Lord God that healeth all
[1:05:38] diseases

[1:09:38] up and so Wednesday we will be going
[1:09:40] down to Dry Creek Louisiana
[1:09:42] not supposed to be dry this weekend
[1:09:45] I hear there are natural showers and I
[1:09:48] know there's Showers of Blessings coming
[1:09:50] so come and look for the rain amen the
[1:09:54] former in the latter ring being poured

[1:10:02] rain can hold off for the camp it'll be
[1:10:05] really nice for that pray that way
[1:10:09] I'm sure winds tonight you were blessed
[1:10:12] by Brother Carmen Mills
[1:10:14] who ministered varus on Wednesday night
[1:10:17] he comes from New Brunswick Canada
[1:10:21] um he I I've known them through the
[1:10:24] years you know I as as I know sometimes
[1:10:28] you can't go with me everywhere that I
[1:10:30] go and and see everywhere that I am
[1:10:34] but
[1:10:35] um you know I've ministered for them
[1:10:37] since the the early 90s through some of
[1:10:41] their conventions Through The Years up
[1:10:43] there in New Brunswick brother Ivan Carr
[1:10:45] is now 93 years old he continues to
[1:10:48] minister twice a week he's my mentor
[1:10:54] it's assigned to us to never give up
[1:10:57] and if that ain't good enough God gave
[1:10:59] us Ron Spencer to kick ourselves in the
[1:11:01] rear every weekend
[1:11:03] after you hear him preach well you can't
[1:11:05] sit around and feel sorry for yourself
[1:11:07] anymore
[1:11:09] so I was just with him and brother Kelly
[1:11:12] Hildebrandt up there in Charlottesville
[1:11:14] area that's where I flew in and and
[1:11:18] um was with brother Ron and them we had
[1:11:20] a great time together sometimes a
[1:11:22] fellowship and thank you for letting me
[1:11:24] be gone in a way but like I said brother
[1:11:27] Carmen came and he ministered
[1:11:30] on when God remembers what a wonderful
[1:11:35] message
[1:11:36] and it certainly stirred our hearts this
[1:11:39] morning as I you know you just can't
[1:11:42] make all this stuff up you know that
[1:11:44] that that comes and we just saw the hand
[1:11:47] of God so much Discerning the thoughts
[1:11:49] and intents of hard and certainly
[1:11:52] um minister to us
[1:11:54] and um so you know back uh when I come
[1:11:59] home today and I turned on my computer
[1:12:02] and uh came up with my my sermon notes
[1:12:07] that I have there and I just was open up
[1:12:10] the one that I had prepared for today
[1:12:12] and was just looking at it and and just
[1:12:15] pushed the button and as I did it it
[1:12:18] just made it where I could see more than
[1:12:19] just that one but another one that was
[1:12:22] there
[1:12:23] and it opened up to one that had been on
[1:12:26] my desktop for now since December
[1:12:30] on December the 18th 2022
[1:12:34] the people of the book part 175 I
[1:12:37] preached the sermon God remembers
[1:12:42] and so you know um again it's just a
[1:12:46] confirmation that God remembers
[1:12:49] amen and it's not that God forgets
[1:12:52] but it's the time when God is going to
[1:12:55] bring his promises to pass
[1:12:57] and I don't know if you remember or not
[1:13:00] but I just printed out just a couple of
[1:13:01] notes from there this morning there that
[1:13:05] in the Old Testament you know it always
[1:13:08] when God remembers is a call for Action
[1:13:11] it includes an action is when God starts
[1:13:14] he remembers start something starts
[1:13:16] happening
[1:13:18] and so you know he remembered Noah made
[1:13:21] the water recede you remember Rachel and
[1:13:24] opened her womb and years later her day
[1:13:26] Hebrews cried for rescue God remembered
[1:13:29] his Covenant with their their ancestors
[1:13:31] and rescued them and and uh so we're
[1:13:34] living in a time of fulfillment and it's
[1:13:37] never a time that God forgets his
[1:13:39] promises or his people because he's
[1:13:42] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[1:13:44] end the creator of the universe and he
[1:13:46] doesn't suffer from memory lapses
[1:13:49] and just in case you forgot what I
[1:13:51] preached that's what I preached
[1:13:53] amen but we're not going to preach that
[1:13:55] this morning we're going to go to
[1:13:56] Genesis 18 and verse 10 and we're going
[1:13:59] to read that
[1:14:00] and let you be seated
[1:14:02] and then we'll read a scripture from the
[1:14:05] next to the last book of the Bible Jude
[1:14:08] Genesis 18 verse 10
[1:14:10] and he said I will certainly return unto
[1:14:13] thee according to the time of life and
[1:14:15] lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[1:14:18] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[1:14:20] which was behind him
[1:14:22] you can be seated
[1:14:25] and here is where faith is restored to
[1:14:28] Sarah
[1:14:30] that brings about the Winds of Change
[1:14:34] that would restore her body
[1:14:37] and her place give her her place in the
[1:14:41] Covenant
[1:14:43] now turn with me to Jude chapter 1 which
[1:14:46] there's only one chapter but verse 3.
[1:14:49] and we'll read from there a couple of
[1:14:51] verses and it's from here I'm going to
[1:14:53] take my text this morning
[1:14:56] beloved when I gave all diligence to
[1:14:58] write unto you of the common salvation
[1:15:00] it was needful for me to write into you
[1:15:03] and exhort you
[1:15:05] that you should earnestly contend for
[1:15:08] the faith which was once delivered to
[1:15:10] the Saints
[1:15:12] for there are certain men crept in
[1:15:14] unawares who were before a bold ordained
[1:15:17] of this condemnation ungodly men turn in
[1:15:20] the grace of our God into lasciviously
[1:15:23] lasciviousness and denying the only Lord
[1:15:26] God and our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:31] so today I'm going to speak to you on
[1:15:33] contending
[1:15:35] for the faith
[1:15:37] now you know again a Content means to
[1:15:42] struggle far it means to fight far to
[1:15:45] war to battle for that faith
[1:15:48] that was once delivered to the Saints
[1:15:52] and the the way that it's awarded here
[1:15:55] that once delivered
[1:15:57] uh it seems to indicate that they were
[1:16:00] already losing that Faith but they were
[1:16:03] to fight for it
[1:16:06] and and of course you know it's a day in
[1:16:09] hour where that we must fight to possess
[1:16:12] every promise of God
[1:16:14] and it is a battle
[1:16:16] and every denomination in its own way is
[1:16:19] a part of this battle they're all
[1:16:21] claiming to contend for the faith
[1:16:24] in Judah it's the only place that we
[1:16:27] read where that in the Bible we're
[1:16:30] taught to contend he said I now
[1:16:32] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:16:35] once to deliver to the Saints well we
[1:16:38] know the Baptists think they're
[1:16:39] contending for their for the faith and
[1:16:41] and they did they fought and they died
[1:16:45] they were terribly persecuted for
[1:16:48] insisting on adult baptism instead of
[1:16:52] infant baptism
[1:16:53] many were burned at the stake and put to
[1:16:56] the sword because they were re they
[1:16:59] re-baptized those that had been baptized
[1:17:02] as babies and this time instead of
[1:17:04] sprinkling they baptized them
[1:17:07] um by immersion
[1:17:08] and so they stood for their faith and as
[1:17:12] I said just for that amount of Truth
[1:17:14] they they contended for it and I you
[1:17:17] know you can look and you can see that
[1:17:19] they built a fort there we call that a
[1:17:22] denomination
[1:17:23] and they built a fort there on that deal
[1:17:26] and became named the fort became named
[1:17:29] Baptist
[1:17:30] well because that they believed in
[1:17:34] um baptism by immersion and and as
[1:17:37] adults and not babies because the
[1:17:39] Catholic church had always taught it
[1:17:42] differently that you're born into the
[1:17:44] Catholic church this is how you're born
[1:17:46] into the church you don't have a new
[1:17:48] birth just being born into the church
[1:17:50] makes you that and then you are you are
[1:17:52] born into it by the by the um sprinkling
[1:17:55] of the Holy Water by the priest and of
[1:17:59] course you know we we have the the
[1:18:01] Pentecostals which is one of the last
[1:18:04] day moves that they also believe that
[1:18:06] they're contending for the faith
[1:18:08] and they did they fought for an
[1:18:10] experience of the Holy Ghost and
[1:18:13] believed with in speaking in tongues and
[1:18:16] gifts of the Spirit
[1:18:18] these people fought for this and it was
[1:18:21] not without a cost
[1:18:23] but they they were shot at women you
[1:18:27] know there's there's actually
[1:18:28] testimonies of women who and and men as
[1:18:32] they rejoice in the spirit and and they
[1:18:35] were shot at Through the Windows and and
[1:18:38] the bullets would hit their dresses and
[1:18:40] fall to the floor
[1:18:42] and their churches were burned and many
[1:18:45] of them were beat actually sometimes
[1:18:47] tired and feathered oh yeah that
[1:18:50] happened here in this 19th century in
[1:18:52] the 1900s as they were beat for their
[1:18:55] stand for the truths of the Gospel they
[1:18:59] contended for that faith
[1:19:01] there was a lot of sacrifices made by
[1:19:04] men and women alike
[1:19:06] and of course before them the nazarenes
[1:19:09] which was a part of the
[1:19:11] um Holiness Movement by John Wesley they
[1:19:14] believed that they are contending for
[1:19:16] the faith but like the Pentecostals the
[1:19:18] Pentecostals have built themselves a
[1:19:20] fort and they call that Pentecost
[1:19:23] and and that they they're stationed
[1:19:26] there upon that truth of restoration of
[1:19:30] gifts of the Spirit and speaking in
[1:19:32] tongues and the baptism of the Holy
[1:19:34] Ghost as they call it and then and then
[1:19:37] of course the nazarenes did the same
[1:19:39] they built them afford on Holiness of
[1:19:42] course you know their walls are falling
[1:19:43] down and a lot of worldliness has come
[1:19:46] in and they're not nothing like they
[1:19:49] were but they were part of the Methodist
[1:19:51] move insisting on Holiness as John
[1:19:55] Wesley priesthood and they too were
[1:19:57] persecuted and kicked out of their
[1:20:00] churches and and they and and even John
[1:20:03] Wesley was kicked out of his church and
[1:20:06] and uh preached on the street corners
[1:20:08] and he would many times sing and and
[1:20:12] until a group of people a crowd would
[1:20:14] gather around and then we would begin to
[1:20:18] preach and what he preached actually of
[1:20:21] Holiness and a holy life and you know
[1:20:24] something more than than the than just
[1:20:27] um church annity and but you know
[1:20:29] something that would change you and the
[1:20:32] priest and the laity many times were
[1:20:34] offended by his sermons
[1:20:37] and they and they would hire Thugs and
[1:20:40] rabble rousers to disturb him and many
[1:20:43] of them priests felt that Wesley was
[1:20:46] preaching without being authorized to do
[1:20:49] so by the church in Medlin with the
[1:20:52] people in their town so he would be run
[1:20:55] out of town many times as he contended
[1:20:58] for the faith and during those 19 years
[1:21:02] of sermons John was pelted with rotten
[1:21:05] tomatoes and manure and stones but he
[1:21:09] refused to give up
[1:21:11] and for those 19 years this was this
[1:21:14] weekly even his daily experience he was
[1:21:17] dragged before magistrates he was beaten
[1:21:20] with fists he was pummeled with rocks
[1:21:23] and and homes where he stayed with set
[1:21:26] of Fire
[1:21:27] but you know it's so he contended for
[1:21:31] the faith and and the people that
[1:21:33] followed him build camps they built a
[1:21:36] denominations thoughts there fortifying
[1:21:39] that position
[1:21:41] of um the methodists and the nazarenes
[1:21:44] and the pilgrim Holiness and so on
[1:21:47] you know and but sadly though there may
[1:21:51] be some that still stand like the
[1:21:53] Baptists stand for immersion and though
[1:21:56] the Pentecost will still stand for the
[1:21:58] gifts and others defend certain portions
[1:22:01] of Truth yet they have progressed no
[1:22:04] further in standing for the faith that
[1:22:07] was once delivered to the Saints
[1:22:09] but if we want to see what it means to
[1:22:12] to choose
[1:22:15] to stand for the faith that was once
[1:22:18] delivered to the Saints we need to go
[1:22:20] back and look at Jesus
[1:22:22] amen that what Jesus was yesterday we
[1:22:26] know he would be the same today
[1:22:28] or the scripture is wrong if we can see
[1:22:31] what he was here in his body of Flagship
[1:22:34] on the earth in his Corporal body we
[1:22:37] should be able to see what he would be
[1:22:39] in his body the church today if he's the
[1:22:42] same yesterday today and forever so you
[1:22:45] see we can look back and see what he was
[1:22:48] and then you can see then what he would
[1:22:51] be in his body the church we of course
[1:22:55] would see his body then fulfilling mark
[1:22:58] 16. and the Great Commission we would
[1:23:02] see ourselves fulfilling John 14 12 The
[1:23:05] Works that I do say you do also and Mark
[1:23:08] 11 22 if you say to this mountain be
[1:23:12] thou removed and cast into the sea it
[1:23:14] shall be even as you said
[1:23:16] so what kind of Faith are we contending
[1:23:20] for I want to say today we are a people
[1:23:23] that are contending for the greatest
[1:23:25] faith that has ever been
[1:23:28] where that the early church was upon the
[1:23:32] cusp of it as doctrines was revealed and
[1:23:35] and miracles would happen in their
[1:23:37] Ministry yet Paul would say you know but
[1:23:40] but those who are asleep you know don't
[1:23:44] sorrow as those who have no hope but I
[1:23:47] tell you this the Lord will come and he
[1:23:50] he shall descend from heaven with his
[1:23:52] shout and with the voice of the
[1:23:54] Archangel and with the Trump of God and
[1:23:57] we shall all be changed in a moment in a
[1:24:00] twinkling of an eye so what kind of
[1:24:03] Faith are we contending for we are we
[1:24:07] are contending for body changing faith
[1:24:16] if I could say it
[1:24:18] third pool faith
[1:24:21] and that came by the opening of the word
[1:24:22] remember that the third poll or the
[1:24:25] third phase of brother Brandon's
[1:24:26] Ministry was based on Mark 11 22.
[1:24:31] and that in that word that was revealed
[1:24:34] and restored is a dynamic power
[1:24:38] to make mountains move to cause
[1:24:41] impossibilities to become possibilities
[1:24:44] remember this this is what you are
[1:24:48] contending for for your impossibilities
[1:24:51] to become possibilities
[1:24:55] amen this Faith was demonstrated uh in
[1:24:58] in the days of Jesus by Roman Centurion
[1:25:01] and this is a faith into Gentile bride
[1:25:05] must come to the Jews never came to this
[1:25:09] kind of Faith as as Jesus would say of
[1:25:12] the Romans interior I haven't seen this
[1:25:15] Faith this kind of faith in all of
[1:25:18] Israel
[1:25:19] but I found it in a gentile
[1:25:22] amen and that Roman Centurion said Lord
[1:25:25] I'm not even worthy for you to come
[1:25:28] under my roof and you don't even have to
[1:25:31] come to my house
[1:25:32] just speak the word and my servant will
[1:25:36] live
[1:25:37] I'm on a centurion that was a man of
[1:25:41] authority over about a hundred of Rome's
[1:25:44] best soldiers and he can stand there and
[1:25:46] say I'm a man of authority I say to this
[1:25:50] man go and he goes there I say you go
[1:25:53] and fight here and you go fight and you
[1:25:55] go there and they do it they have to
[1:25:58] obey me and he knew that he was Jesus
[1:26:01] was the son of God and that every
[1:26:04] sickness and every demon was underneath
[1:26:07] him
[1:26:08] and all he had to do was speak the word
[1:26:10] not even pray
[1:26:12] he would just speak the word that's all
[1:26:14] and it would be done because every demon
[1:26:17] would have to bow to him and Obey him do
[1:26:20] you believe that this morning every
[1:26:22] demon will obey God it has to
[1:26:26] everything obeys God and it'll obey you
[1:26:29] if you have faith
[1:26:32] Jesus never limited to himself he said
[1:26:36] if you say to this mountain whatsoever
[1:26:39] things you desire When you pray believe
[1:26:42] that you receive them and you will have
[1:26:45] them
[1:26:47] you don't realize sometimes the power
[1:26:49] that lays within your words
[1:26:52] Joshua would stop the son
[1:26:54] is that true amen you've been a lot of a
[1:26:57] lot of us say all things are possible
[1:26:59] with God but you know there's nothing
[1:27:01] impossible with him but all things are
[1:27:04] possible to you also nothing's
[1:27:06] impossible to them that believe
[1:27:09] all things are possible if God made it
[1:27:12] right and brought it right down just if
[1:27:14] you just know who God was and then know
[1:27:17] who you are is the son of God
[1:27:19] and brother Brandon would say this he
[1:27:21] said I I'm afraid the church doesn't
[1:27:23] know their Authority
[1:27:25] I'm afraid the Holy Ghost born man
[1:27:28] doesn't realize the authority God has
[1:27:31] permitted the church I give to you the
[1:27:33] keys to the kingdom whatever you bind on
[1:27:37] Earth I'll bind in heaven whatever you
[1:27:40] were loose on Earth will be loosed
[1:27:43] loosed on Earth I'll loose it in heaven
[1:27:45] I give you power over certain serpents
[1:27:48] and every kind of disease and nothing
[1:27:51] shall harm you exercise your faith Let
[1:27:54] it Loose let God have his way God will
[1:27:57] grant it to you
[1:28:01] don't we realize when Jesus said this
[1:28:03] speak to this mountain whatsoever things
[1:28:06] you desire When you pray believe you
[1:28:08] receive them and you shall have them
[1:28:10] that in doing that and giving us that
[1:28:12] word he actually gave you a blank check
[1:28:18] with authority to fill it out
[1:28:22] he never limited it to anything did he
[1:28:24] he gave you a blank check
[1:28:27] whatever you need
[1:28:29] come on
[1:28:31] we don't have to wait for youth camp but
[1:28:33] if you're waiting for it go ahead and
[1:28:35] write it out
[1:28:37] amen go ahead and tell God your
[1:28:39] expectations
[1:28:41] go ahead and write out your claim amen
[1:28:44] because God is here to answer every
[1:28:47] desire ever need and you will not go
[1:28:50] away empty
[1:28:52] amount
[1:28:54] every one of you that has received the
[1:28:56] Holy Ghost you have been placed in the
[1:28:58] family of God
[1:29:00] as a son of God
[1:29:02] and with their full authority to use his
[1:29:06] name
[1:29:07] think about that the full authority to
[1:29:10] use his name Jesus said these signs
[1:29:13] shall follow them that believe in other
[1:29:15] words this will be the identification of
[1:29:18] those that are sending me in my name
[1:29:21] they shall cast out devils and
[1:29:24] whatsoever you ask in my name that will
[1:29:27] do John 14 3 and he repeats the same in
[1:29:31] verse 14. if you ask anything in my name
[1:29:34] I will do it you have the authority he
[1:29:38] says to use my name
[1:29:41] whatsoever you ask the father in my name
[1:29:45] he will give it to you
[1:29:48] amen that is a black Shack for every one
[1:29:51] of you today and I'll tell you what if I
[1:29:54] were you I would write it out
[1:29:56] some of you need to actually just open
[1:29:58] the fly leaf of your Bible and write out
[1:30:01] a promise
[1:30:03] write out a check
[1:30:05] say I write out a check I want my
[1:30:07] husband saved I want my wife saved I
[1:30:11] want my children saved I want healing
[1:30:13] from my body I want Deliverance in the
[1:30:16] church amen I want Harmony in my family
[1:30:19] whatever it is you right after check
[1:30:22] [Applause]
[1:30:26] Jesus told you to do so
[1:30:31] the scripture speaks of the adoptions of
[1:30:33] sons
[1:30:34] who when they are adopted they're given
[1:30:36] positions of authority
[1:30:39] the usual meaning of the the word
[1:30:41] adoption means to adopt a child is born
[1:30:44] to someone else
[1:30:46] but the Roman adoption was when us when
[1:30:48] a man's own son
[1:30:50] became a fuller age and was placed with
[1:30:55] power and authority over the father's
[1:30:58] domain
[1:30:59] and this happens to us when we receive
[1:31:01] the Holy Ghost
[1:31:03] but I want you to know that it's also an
[1:31:06] adoption hour for the church
[1:31:09] individually you have been adopted but
[1:31:11] the church also is going to be adopted
[1:31:14] and this uh this adoption aged for the
[1:31:17] church to come into their full
[1:31:19] inheritance with power and Dominion this
[1:31:23] fulfills the scripture of Romans 8 19
[1:31:25] where the whole world groans
[1:31:29] anticipating the manifestations of the
[1:31:32] sons of God where God called men and
[1:31:35] women will be known as Sons at place and
[1:31:39] positioned with power and authority
[1:31:44] brother Branham told us and hear you him
[1:31:46] he said that's where God is trying to
[1:31:48] get his church now
[1:31:50] just say to this mountain be moved and
[1:31:53] it will move Authority sons of God the
[1:31:57] whole creation is groaning waiting for
[1:32:00] the manifestations of the sons of God
[1:32:02] waiting to a spot where sickness will be
[1:32:06] arise and it'll be that way the blind
[1:32:10] will receive their sight the deaf and
[1:32:12] dumb we pray for them now but then
[1:32:15] you'll command it didn't say these
[1:32:18] Saints have followed them that believe
[1:32:19] they'll pray for the sick he said he
[1:32:21] said they shall cast out devil not I
[1:32:23] will they will
[1:32:24] so I want you to understand what he said
[1:32:26] it said you will do this not me you're
[1:32:30] going to do this not Jesus you've got to
[1:32:33] do this
[1:32:34] amen you these signs shall follow them
[1:32:37] to believe if you say to this mountain
[1:32:39] not I say but if you say to this
[1:32:41] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[1:32:44] your heart what we need is adoption amen
[1:32:47] we're we are made for Dominion
[1:32:51] realize this you have been made for
[1:32:54] Dominion you were created by God and by
[1:32:58] your new birth you certainly have been
[1:33:01] made for Dominion
[1:33:03] you see sin is not to rule over you it's
[1:33:06] sickness is not to rule over you trouble
[1:33:09] is not to rule over you you are to rule
[1:33:12] over your trouble you are to walk on
[1:33:14] your Waters
[1:33:17] amen remember this God Made You for
[1:33:20] Dominion he did not make you to be a
[1:33:24] slave to sin a slave to sickness of
[1:33:27] slaves of trouble God made you to be our
[1:33:31] Dominion
[1:33:32] in the beginning in Genesis 2 God gave
[1:33:35] them dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:33:38] and over the fowl of the air and through
[1:33:40] sin then what happened man lost his
[1:33:43] Dominion
[1:33:45] he lost his godship he lost his sonship
[1:33:48] and Satan took over
[1:33:51] but where are we at now
[1:33:53] we're at the end we're not back over
[1:33:56] here to the beginning of this story we
[1:33:59] are here in the manifestations of the
[1:34:01] sons of God as prophesied in Romans 8
[1:34:04] where you and we're waiting for that
[1:34:06] manifestation where sons of God come
[1:34:10] back and take it over again
[1:34:12] you look at the world you're living in
[1:34:14] today sin house it evil house act but it
[1:34:18] won't always be that way
[1:34:20] hey man we're coming back Revelation 19
[1:34:23] says after we go away we're coming back
[1:34:26] we'll write with him on the white horses
[1:34:28] following the word of God and we'll come
[1:34:31] back and take the world over defeat the
[1:34:34] Antichrist
[1:34:35] throw him in prison for a hundred for a
[1:34:37] thousand years and we'll have a
[1:34:39] millennial Reign where the devil won't
[1:34:42] have power over anything
[1:34:50] and if the Rapture takes place today
[1:34:52] we're only three and a half years away
[1:34:55] from the millennium
[1:34:57] [Applause]
[1:34:59] that's how close you are
[1:35:02] the millennium's not way out under
[1:35:04] millenniums right here
[1:35:06] we're just going to go away
[1:35:10] for a short time
[1:35:12] but we're coming back
[1:35:14] I'm telling the devil
[1:35:16] we're not leaving out of here defeated
[1:35:20] I'm telling the devil even though we're
[1:35:22] escaping the things that are coming on
[1:35:24] the earth let me tell you that escape is
[1:35:26] not escaping from the devil it's
[1:35:27] escaping from the wrath of God that is
[1:35:30] going to be poured out through the seven
[1:35:31] vials on the earth in the tribulation we
[1:35:34] are to being taken away so God can judge
[1:35:37] the Earth
[1:35:38] and burn it with fire
[1:35:40] and bring us back to I walk on the ashes
[1:35:43] of the wicked I'm quoting Bible
[1:35:45] it is your Malachi for scripture that
[1:35:48] says the people in this end time will do
[1:35:51] that
[1:35:52] Hallelujah those that have received
[1:35:55] Malachi 4th and Elijah Prophet that is
[1:35:58] promised and the hearts have been turned
[1:36:00] back to the faith of the father they
[1:36:02] will come back when though after the
[1:36:04] world burns like an oven and walk on the
[1:36:07] Isis
[1:36:09] oh Hallelujah
[1:36:11] Hallelujah don't you know you'll walk on
[1:36:13] the ashes of every Tavern
[1:36:15] of every brothel of over every evil
[1:36:18] thing
[1:36:19] amen God has already given you power to
[1:36:22] walk over it
[1:36:24] amen
[1:36:25] amen he's already given you the power to
[1:36:28] be an overcomer
[1:36:30] but now
[1:36:32] we are people
[1:36:34] who he said
[1:36:36] will come back when the power of God
[1:36:38] will walk out and take every Power
[1:36:42] that Satan has away from him
[1:36:45] ever power
[1:36:48] wow
[1:36:50] every Power somebody look at the others
[1:36:52] say every Power
[1:36:55] amen he said waiting for the fullness of
[1:36:58] time when the pyramid gets at the top
[1:37:01] now what he's talking about the gospel
[1:37:03] starting down low and coming up like a
[1:37:06] pyramid coming narrow narrow until it's
[1:37:08] capped off with Christ coming back not a
[1:37:11] pyramid itself and not a pyramid
[1:37:13] Doctrine just using it for an example
[1:37:15] you know like a pyramid coming up and it
[1:37:18] comes up to an Apex and it'll come up to
[1:37:20] the Apex right here at the top before
[1:37:23] the Capstone comes there will be a
[1:37:25] people who have the same Ministry that
[1:37:27] Christ had before he left because it has
[1:37:30] to be a match Feast to the coming Christ
[1:37:32] it'll be God In Bright form working in
[1:37:36] his people living in his people and they
[1:37:39] will false Sons will be manifested when
[1:37:42] the power of God will walk out
[1:37:44] Hallelujah and take every Power Satan's
[1:37:48] got away from him
[1:37:53] now
[1:37:54] we're contending
[1:37:57] against the spirit
[1:38:00] never think this is a flesh and blood
[1:38:03] Affair oh brother Tim you know sounds
[1:38:07] like you're against the Baptist we're
[1:38:08] not against Baptists
[1:38:11] well it sounds like you're against these
[1:38:13] Pentecostal we're not against the
[1:38:15] Pentacles sound like sometimes you're
[1:38:17] against some of these messy churches
[1:38:18] we're not against anybody
[1:38:21] flesh and blood is not in the equation
[1:38:25] we are battling against the spirit
[1:38:29] are you with me we're not battling
[1:38:31] against men but against the spirit
[1:38:34] spiritual wickedness as as evil as a
[1:38:39] wickedness out on the streets of
[1:38:41] America's spiritual wickedness oh yet
[1:38:44] they're fundamentalists
[1:38:46] having basic principle of truth but
[1:38:49] denying the power of the Gospel listen
[1:38:52] you know there were as brother Branham
[1:38:55] said there it was back in the beginning
[1:38:57] there was a middle age and it was the
[1:38:59] same group of fundamental Believers that
[1:39:03] put Jesus on the cross and killed him
[1:39:05] because he had signs and wonders and
[1:39:08] they didn't believe it and that same
[1:39:09] Spirit lives among the churches today a
[1:39:12] religious spirit not a bunch of infidels
[1:39:15] fundamental replace it right there and
[1:39:18] they're exactly right but they have a
[1:39:20] form of godliness fundamentally right
[1:39:22] but denying the power thereof
[1:39:25] the power of what the power of healing
[1:39:28] the power of shouting the powers
[1:39:30] speaking in tongues the power of
[1:39:32] interpreting the power of the church
[1:39:34] moving just like it did at the beginning
[1:39:36] and brother and sister we are contending
[1:39:39] for the faith that was once delivered to
[1:39:41] the Saints
[1:39:44] amen we're we're contending not against
[1:39:47] man it's a spirit
[1:39:50] that we are contending against
[1:39:53] a spiritual war
[1:39:57] oh but he allowed people to be
[1:40:00] fundamentally right
[1:40:02] but deny the power
[1:40:04] the power he said of what the power of
[1:40:07] healing power shouting the power of
[1:40:09] speaking in tongues the power of
[1:40:10] interpreting the power of the church
[1:40:11] moving just like it did at the beginning
[1:40:15] you know again we turn churches into
[1:40:18] into treatment centers
[1:40:22] what we will treat the disease of sin
[1:40:25] you know well you know you'll take these
[1:40:28] nine steps and we'll dry you out and
[1:40:30] we'll fix your drug habit and you know
[1:40:32] we'll do this and you do that and we'll
[1:40:34] you know try to conform you and teach
[1:40:36] you now how how to overcome in this way
[1:40:39] and use psychology and methods you know
[1:40:42] to change the mind you know to associate
[1:40:44] that with hurt
[1:40:46] and with pain look what you've done but
[1:40:50] look what it does to your family look
[1:40:51] what it does to you look what it does to
[1:40:53] your children but none of that will hold
[1:40:56] you in the hour of Temptation
[1:40:59] but there is a power
[1:41:01] there is a blood
[1:41:04] Hallelujah that once it comes and
[1:41:07] touches a heart and changes the life you
[1:41:10] don't no more have to worry about them
[1:41:12] anymore amen because it's a power that
[1:41:15] seals them to the day of redemption
[1:41:18] where the devil is sealed out
[1:41:21] and you're sealed in with God
[1:41:24] we're contending for that faith
[1:41:29] now
[1:41:30] people say a lot of times that's against
[1:41:33] my faith
[1:41:36] well there's only one faith
[1:41:39] one Lord One Faith one baptism
[1:41:42] you might have a faith
[1:41:45] but we want the faith
[1:41:49] and we want to earnestly condemn for it
[1:41:52] that means to argue for it
[1:41:54] to stand up for it to earnestly contend
[1:41:58] for the faith that was once delivered to
[1:42:00] the Saints what were they called Saints
[1:42:04] because when they were Sanctified the
[1:42:07] Holy Spirit cleansed them they were
[1:42:09] called Saints
[1:42:10] now Jude would be the Foster brother of
[1:42:13] Jesus and he would say just before the
[1:42:17] you know it'd be one of the last things
[1:42:19] that are said before the book of the
[1:42:21] unveiling
[1:42:22] and Jude is saying you know let us let
[1:42:26] us earnestly contend for the faith that
[1:42:29] was once delivered to the Sea don't ever
[1:42:31] let that fate drop
[1:42:34] and the faith of the of the Saints was
[1:42:38] not in creeds
[1:42:39] it was not in denomination it was not in
[1:42:42] church buildings
[1:42:44] it was not in associations
[1:42:48] amen it was in the presence of the
[1:42:51] Living God
[1:42:52] oh yeah association's good we meet
[1:42:55] together with good people that's
[1:42:57] wonderful but that's not where our faith
[1:42:59] lies
[1:43:00] when we're out of the presence of good
[1:43:02] people
[1:43:03] are you with me the presence of the
[1:43:05] Living God still goes with us
[1:43:08] somebody told me one time brother Tim I
[1:43:10] could live this gospel if you just go
[1:43:12] with me everywhere that I go if you go
[1:43:15] with me to work if you'd go with me to
[1:43:17] to school you go with me wherever I go I
[1:43:20] can live it I said you don't need me
[1:43:23] you need the Holy Ghost
[1:43:26] hey man I can't go with you everywhere
[1:43:28] but he can he'll go with you shopping
[1:43:31] [Applause]
[1:43:32] he'll help you pick out your clothes
[1:43:35] amen he healed you're with you
[1:43:37] everywhere that you are come on he will
[1:43:40] be there right with you when you're
[1:43:42] looking at a movie
[1:43:44] and he's telling you Ah that's wrong
[1:43:47] don't feed on that kind of stuff
[1:43:54] you see the Holy Ghost one of its works
[1:43:56] is convincing you of sin
[1:44:00] and it can't deny his word
[1:44:02] well I you know I don't think brother
[1:44:04] Tim it makes any difference about a
[1:44:07] woman's hair whether it's cut or whether
[1:44:09] it's long I don't I don't think it's any
[1:44:11] difference about a man whether his hair
[1:44:13] is cut or whether it's long
[1:44:17] well the Bible does
[1:44:20] and when you get the Holy Ghost you
[1:44:22] forget your own thoughts
[1:44:25] because you receive a new thinking
[1:44:28] so no longer do you
[1:44:30] say I think
[1:44:33] because I is out the picture
[1:44:36] you see when he comes in and your your
[1:44:39] life begins it's s-i-n
[1:44:42] and I I
[1:44:44] is the most important thing in your life
[1:44:46] what I want and what I want to do and
[1:44:48] how I want to live and what I think
[1:44:52] but when God comes in your life he
[1:44:54] crosses that out and puts a zero there
[1:44:56] and oh there and makes you a son
[1:45:01] Hallelujah and as a son you no longer
[1:45:04] care about what I think you care about
[1:45:07] what father thinks amen what God's word
[1:45:10] said and you exalt his word over your
[1:45:15] own thinking
[1:45:21] now
[1:45:22] the Christian world today are not
[1:45:24] earnestly content we're told not just to
[1:45:27] contend but earnestly
[1:45:30] well my faith
[1:45:32] don't teach miracles
[1:45:34] they teach us past
[1:45:36] you know because we don't need it today
[1:45:38] we have the word no you don't have the
[1:45:42] word you have the letter of the word
[1:45:43] with no life
[1:45:45] so then you're not contending for the
[1:45:48] faith that was once delivered for this
[1:45:50] to the Saints
[1:45:51] so you know of course we don't believe
[1:45:53] in fanaticism
[1:45:55] but there's a real genuine gift to the
[1:45:57] Holy Ghost
[1:45:58] amen we earnestly content for that we
[1:46:01] believe in it Saints speak in tongues
[1:46:04] some say well you know my faith don't
[1:46:07] believe in Divine Healing a lot of
[1:46:08] message people are that away today
[1:46:10] that's just a minor we don't even need
[1:46:11] it today you just ain't been sick enough
[1:46:17] amen I don't believe in Divine Healing
[1:46:19] well we don't believe in a bunch of
[1:46:21] fanaticism either amen but we do believe
[1:46:24] there's a God who heals the sick
[1:46:27] amen that he's the same yesterday today
[1:46:29] and forever
[1:46:30] and we have been told to condemn for the
[1:46:33] faith not a faith Baptists have the
[1:46:37] faith
[1:46:38] Presbyterian happy faith
[1:46:40] the Pentecostals have a faith
[1:46:43] but we want to contend for the faith
[1:46:46] that was once delivered
[1:46:50] and without signs following vindicating
[1:46:52] the truth you don't have the faith
[1:46:56] you might have a knowledge of the
[1:46:58] Revelation but you don't have the faith
[1:46:59] to make it work
[1:47:02] now
[1:47:03] and I wanted to say we have the faith
[1:47:07] the truths of the word has been restored
[1:47:10] we have today by divine inspiration the
[1:47:15] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:47:17] Saints
[1:47:18] but I want you to know though
[1:47:22] as as we declare the word has been
[1:47:25] revealed
[1:47:26] but when the word is revealed it
[1:47:29] expresses itself
[1:47:31] so what has happened is that we have
[1:47:34] swapped the faith for the intellectual
[1:47:38] conception
[1:47:41] because those conceptions of men and
[1:47:43] that turns it into a powerless gospel
[1:47:48] now brother badham told us sin when
[1:47:51] Christ is a mystery of God revealed he
[1:47:54] said when the word is revealed it
[1:47:56] expresses itself
[1:47:57] that was God's purpose for Jesus Christ
[1:48:01] was to express himself to take his own
[1:48:04] laws and live by his laws and fulfill
[1:48:06] his laws by death and Christ God died in
[1:48:10] the flesh in order to condemn sin in the
[1:48:13] flesh that he might bring to himself a
[1:48:15] glorious bride redeemed back that will
[1:48:18] believe only in the word of God well
[1:48:20] that will not swap it like Eve did for
[1:48:23] intellectual conceptions of men you see
[1:48:26] it that's Christ's idea that's God's
[1:48:28] idea the new birth reveals that and if a
[1:48:31] man says he is born again and tries to
[1:48:36] take these promises of Christ in this
[1:48:39] last day to some other age
[1:48:42] making him Christ yesterday but not
[1:48:45] today then that manner that person has
[1:48:48] been in a delusion by Satan and if that
[1:48:52] man says he believes that and it don't
[1:48:55] manifest itself through him Jesus said
[1:48:58] in Mark 16 these signs shall follow them
[1:49:02] that believe into all the world to every
[1:49:04] age casting out Devils speaking with
[1:49:06] tongues all these great manifestations
[1:49:08] of gifts that would follow that they
[1:49:10] shall
[1:49:12] not that they may be or they ought to
[1:49:15] but they will and heavens and earth will
[1:49:19] pass away but his word won't
[1:49:24] so you can see brother Branham was very
[1:49:27] clear in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:49:28] revealed that the word has to be
[1:49:30] expressed
[1:49:31] to be the word
[1:49:33] so when we you know that word is really
[1:49:36] the true word when signs follow it
[1:49:42] so in the church that believes the word
[1:49:44] there must be miracles
[1:49:47] there must be healing
[1:49:50] there must be Deliverance
[1:49:52] there must be gifts of the Spirit all of
[1:49:55] them
[1:49:55] every promise of God
[1:49:57] amen there must be Ministry anointed
[1:50:01] Ministry that not only must be anointed
[1:50:03] Ministry but there must be an anointed
[1:50:05] Church
[1:50:07] the church Anointed with the same Spirit
[1:50:09] that's upon the ministry
[1:50:11] the power isn't all to be in the Pulpit
[1:50:13] the powers to be in the pew
[1:50:16] amen believers
[1:50:18] what the signs follow them that believe
[1:50:22] remember the faith that was once
[1:50:24] delivered to the Saints God had to bring
[1:50:26] a prophet in this day to bring us back
[1:50:29] and restore us back Malachi 4 said that
[1:50:32] he would turn the hearts of the children
[1:50:33] back to the faith of the fathers
[1:50:36] so therefore the original faith of the
[1:50:39] fathers of Pentecostal fathers is what
[1:50:41] has been promised it's the same Doctrine
[1:50:44] word by word Power by power Spirit the
[1:50:47] same dangerous exactly like it was
[1:50:49] beginning through signs and wonders of
[1:50:51] the living presence of Christ and that's
[1:50:53] what your Prophet taught
[1:50:55] amen my Prophet too
[1:50:58] now let me just say this
[1:51:03] and this is where we want to Center
[1:51:06] God wants to create a faith
[1:51:09] for a rapturing church
[1:51:16] so he says
[1:51:19] if we could just realize the Holy Ghost
[1:51:22] is upon us
[1:51:23] creating in us a faith trying to present
[1:51:26] himself in so many ways and gifts to
[1:51:29] creative faith for a rapturing church
[1:51:32] it should put us in action but wonder if
[1:51:35] we're doing it the way he wanted it to
[1:51:37] be with reverence and humility the
[1:51:39] pillar of fire in this last day ought to
[1:51:42] put the whole church into action
[1:51:44] it being Vindicated signs of his coming
[1:51:48] he spoke of it as being raptured in
[1:51:51] Grace and he said I'm not trying to
[1:51:53] condemn you he said and what you have
[1:51:55] but I'm trying to give you more Rapture
[1:51:58] and Grace
[1:51:59] and that's the way it is even when we're
[1:52:01] talking about these camps these forts
[1:52:04] that have fortified around baptism or
[1:52:06] gifts or or Holiness or whatever and
[1:52:09] they built their little walls
[1:52:12] we're not trying to condemn them we're
[1:52:14] trying to say there's more
[1:52:17] amen there's a Grace that is being given
[1:52:20] for a Rapture amen that we'll have in
[1:52:24] this hour to come we'll have a Rapture
[1:52:26] power not only to heal the body but
[1:52:28] change it in a moment in a twinkling of
[1:52:31] an eye that Christ will be so real in
[1:52:33] their bodies till he can change it by
[1:52:35] his death of what he purchased
[1:52:38] Christ's surreal in you
[1:52:42] that he can change your body
[1:52:48] now it ought to be a cry from our hearts
[1:52:50] to see God fulfill his word
[1:52:54] it ought to cause a longing down on the
[1:52:56] inside
[1:52:58] of you know
[1:53:00] come to me Jesus
[1:53:02] don't leave me alone
[1:53:05] keep knocking on my door
[1:53:07] amen keep dealing with my heart
[1:53:10] don't let me go Lord whatever you do in
[1:53:13] order to be a cry in our hearts for God
[1:53:16] to fulfill his word brother Branson to
[1:53:18] church has got so backslid he said they
[1:53:21] eat food like a buzzer does carrying of
[1:53:24] an age past the Holy Spirit has no more
[1:53:26] right away in the truth some more no
[1:53:28] more prayer prayer meetings no more
[1:53:30] agonizing with God to fulfill his word
[1:53:33] no more believing that the word is still
[1:53:35] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:53:38] you say wow brother Tim yeah we we're
[1:53:41] contending for the faith I'm asking you
[1:53:43] are you agonizing for it
[1:53:48] agonizing
[1:53:50] when we're living in this hour
[1:53:53] when we're seeing the evil in the land
[1:53:56] and The Trebles in her head
[1:53:59] brother sister don't you realize
[1:54:01] there there needs to be somebody
[1:54:04] agonizing
[1:54:06] the Bible said I'm going to put a seal
[1:54:08] on those a mark on those who sigh and
[1:54:11] cry
[1:54:12] but the Abominations that's done in the
[1:54:15] city
[1:54:16] amen is more than just making you sick
[1:54:19] it's more than just giving you something
[1:54:21] to talk about about how evil the world
[1:54:23] is getting
[1:54:25] amen but it's a people that begin to
[1:54:28] agonize with God
[1:54:30] fulfill your word of God
[1:54:33] whatever you do don't let us keep on
[1:54:36] going down into Sodom do let us keep
[1:54:39] going toward the burning Lord let your
[1:54:42] church get a people out of here it's a
[1:54:45] late hour and I don't want to be left
[1:54:48] behind
[1:54:52] whatever you have to do shake me down
[1:54:55] turn me upside down shake me but
[1:54:58] whatever don't turn me loose
[1:55:00] keep a hold of me God and I'm like Jacob
[1:55:03] of the heel Grabber I'm getting a hold
[1:55:06] of that promise and I'm not letting go
[1:55:08] until I'm blessed
[1:55:12] that's the way you ought to look for
[1:55:13] Rapture and faith
[1:55:15] Lord I want that faith
[1:55:19] surely we're on the very cusp of the
[1:55:21] rapture
[1:55:22] the very hour of the change
[1:55:25] and brother Branham said this we've
[1:55:27] lived the time out
[1:55:30] and the time of the Rapture is at hand
[1:55:33] and we're looking
[1:55:35] for eruption faith
[1:55:37] that will pull can pull the church
[1:55:40] together and give it some Supernatural
[1:55:43] strength that can change these bodies
[1:55:46] that we're living in
[1:55:47] I want you to understand he had an
[1:55:49] expectation
[1:55:51] an expectation we are we're looking for
[1:55:54] Rapture and faith that can pull the
[1:55:57] church together and give it some
[1:55:59] Supernatural strength
[1:56:02] that can change his body when we see God
[1:56:05] can raise the dead off the floor out in
[1:56:07] the yard and bring him back to life
[1:56:08] again present him here before when we
[1:56:11] see a God who can take a cancer that's
[1:56:13] in a man to Shadow raise them up to a
[1:56:16] strong healthy man that ought to give
[1:56:18] Rapture and Faith to the people
[1:56:21] amen that ought to give Rapture and
[1:56:23] Faith when we can see God working Among
[1:56:26] Us
[1:56:28] amen so God isn't working Among Us how
[1:56:31] in the world are you going to ever have
[1:56:32] raptured faith
[1:56:36] you said brother Tim but I I got Rapture
[1:56:38] and Faith no you got Doctrine
[1:56:42] you have a theology
[1:56:45] but we need a supernatural streaks
[1:56:48] to change these metal bodies
[1:56:52] and we should be going from glory to
[1:56:54] glory as we look into the book
[1:56:57] the Bible said we look into the Bible
[1:57:00] the book as a mirror and we're not
[1:57:03] what's in the mirror but we are changed
[1:57:05] from glory to glory till we fit what's
[1:57:08] in the mirror
[1:57:09] look at the Bible it speaks of you this
[1:57:13] is what God wants you to be
[1:57:16] and you're looking there until you allow
[1:57:18] God to change you
[1:57:25] you need to look in the message the word
[1:57:28] of God
[1:57:30] it's the wise hour change
[1:57:33] until you become what God Said
[1:57:35] hear this and here's Sarah now she's an
[1:57:38] old woman she's 90.
[1:57:40] she don't look nothing like the promise
[1:57:44] god holds the promise before her like
[1:57:46] this
[1:57:47] and says right here you're a mother
[1:57:50] if you're in the Covenant
[1:57:51] you are in the promise
[1:57:56] and she says I don't look like that
[1:57:59] and how can be that how can this happen
[1:58:03] and he says is there anything too hard
[1:58:05] for the Lord
[1:58:07] you look at your own self and you see
[1:58:09] him failures
[1:58:11] I don't fit this I might like this I'm
[1:58:14] not that's spotless bride I'm not that
[1:58:16] people I ought to be I'm black in here
[1:58:19] I'm lacking there
[1:58:21] you're looking there but keep gazing
[1:58:25] Don't Take Your Eyes Off of it keep
[1:58:28] looking at it
[1:58:29] possess your Gaze on this word you have
[1:58:33] changed the glory to glory
[1:58:36] until you match
[1:58:38] his blurry
[1:58:45] you're the people of the book look in
[1:58:47] the book
[1:58:52] you can't do that intellectually
[1:58:55] you've got to get in the spirit
[1:58:58] should be the Cry of our hearts
[1:59:01] brother Branham even even after the

[1:59:07] and preached to us in 64.
[1:59:10] he said they never found a better way he
[1:59:13] went through that whole thing we ain't
[1:59:14] never found a better way
[1:59:16] for a baby to get what it wants them to
[1:59:19] cry for it
[1:59:21] you can give him a bell and say junior

[1:59:52] sophisticated way of just believe the
[1:59:55] message and say God sent a prophet I

[1:59:59] and you're saved
[2:00:01] amen well that's just like Junior trying
[2:00:04] to ring the bell that ain't gonna work

[2:00:09] amen that was God's provided away and
[2:00:12] brother Brandon said God
[2:00:14] recommends this for his children

[2:03:17] I hear preachers say
[2:03:20] a lot of young people to say I don't
[2:03:21] know whether I have the Holy Ghost
[2:03:23] I don't know that I got it
[2:03:26] well do you believe the message yeah
[2:03:28] you believe that whatever word is true

[2:03:32] you got it
[2:03:37] and they know they're not living
[2:03:38] overcoming lives
[2:03:41] so they're wondering well how can I help
[2:03:43] the Holy Ghost and I got sin in my life
[2:03:45] like this I can't overcome I can't be
[2:03:48] victorious
[2:03:49] I you know I'm not going to tell you
[2:03:51] because you can verbally say Amen to
[2:03:53] every word of God
[2:03:56] you know
[2:03:57] listen say an amen to the word
[2:04:00] you say well that's evidence
[2:04:02] that's evidence well yes
[2:04:06] you see when your life
[2:04:08] says amen
[2:04:10] you don't disagree with any of it you
[2:04:13] believe it all
[2:04:15] you see brother Brandon's dealing with a
[2:04:17] whole group of people that are speaking
[2:04:18] in tongues and shouting and running the
[2:04:20] aisles and claiming the Holy Ghost and
[2:04:22] bobbing their hair and painting their
[2:04:23] face and wearing men's clothes and
[2:04:28] and then he's and he's saying you know
[2:04:30] the evidence of the Holy Ghost isn't
[2:04:32] jumping and shouting and running you
[2:04:34] know when you can't even believe the
[2:04:35] word
[2:04:40] a man with long hair don't have the Holy
[2:04:42] Ghost he needs it
[2:04:44] amen you say well I I I've accepted
[2:04:47] Christ well you need to get the Holy
[2:04:49] Ghost
[2:04:50] amen a woman with short hair needs the
[2:04:52] Holy Ghost
[2:04:55] come on that's what they need amen a
[2:04:58] woman that a bit that would be a
[2:04:59] cross-dresser and dress like a man
[2:05:02] needs the Holy Ghost a man who will
[2:05:05] cross-dress and dress like a woman needs
[2:05:07] the Holy Ghost
[2:05:09] a man or a woman that's in pornography
[2:05:11] they need the Holy Ghost
[2:05:13] that's what they need a real baptism of
[2:05:16] the Holy Ghost
[2:05:20] and then it'll cause your life to say
[2:05:22] Amen to the word
[2:05:23] now you'll surrender to every word of
[2:05:25] God
[2:05:29] Christians are real genuine articles of
[2:05:32] God they fight for their position
[2:05:35] amen so we have to fight for you say
[2:05:37] well I'll get the Holy Ghost I'll never
[2:05:39] fight again now that's when your battle
[2:05:41] begins
[2:05:43] Jesus was filled with the spirit and
[2:05:45] immediately was led by the spirit to be
[2:05:48] tempted of the devil
[2:05:50] you get the Holy Ghost you're going to
[2:05:52] face the Temptations of the devil
[2:05:55] with overcoming power
[2:05:57] how will you overcome thus saith the
[2:06:00] Lord it is written it is written it is
[2:06:03] written and the Holy Ghost in you will
[2:06:05] bring your life subject
[2:06:09] now it's that body changing
[2:06:14] Rapture power that we need in this hour
[2:06:17] where Christ becomes so real in our
[2:06:19] bodies till he can change it
[2:06:22] no notice now we want to just look at
[2:06:25] this because we want to come to a
[2:06:28] perfect Faith we're contending for the
[2:06:31] faith
[2:06:33] the perfect Faith the crowning Jewel
[2:06:37] of God's Pride will be a people that
[2:06:41] believe him
[2:06:45] and so
[2:06:47] he's appeared to us in this day
[2:06:50] in the same form that he was on the day
[2:06:52] of Pentecost in a pillar of fire the
[2:06:54] same way he was in the Old Testament
[2:06:56] when he appeared to Moses in a burning
[2:06:59] bush
[2:07:00] and he's appeared there with the same
[2:07:02] word it's the same Christ
[2:07:04] because he is now here in the form of
[2:07:08] the Holy Ghost
[2:07:09] not the third person of God the person
[2:07:12] of God coming
[2:07:13] in the form of his holy spirit to come
[2:07:17] and dwell in his people
[2:07:18] the word Christ means anointed one
[2:07:21] in the book of Acts it speaks of Jesus
[2:07:24] of Nazareth a man approved of God
[2:07:27] Anointed with the Holy Ghost who went
[2:07:29] about he done great works
[2:07:31] God manifests and proved that he was in
[2:07:34] this man Jesus
[2:07:37] and now since Pentecost and the baptism
[2:07:41] of his Spirit it came because when Jesus
[2:07:44] went away he said I will send you
[2:07:46] another comforter
[2:07:48] I cannot stay here as the man I've got
[2:07:51] to come back and he said I won't leave
[2:07:54] you comfortless but I will come to you
[2:07:57] and he comes now in the form of the Holy
[2:08:00] Spirit
[2:08:01] and by his infilling we become Anointed
[2:08:05] with that same Spirit
[2:08:07] anointed Messiahs of the last days
[2:08:11] that we shine forth the resurrection of
[2:08:14] Jesus Christ and we show that he's not
[2:08:16] dead
[2:08:17] but he's here in the form of the Holy
[2:08:19] Ghost he's in his people and he's moving
[2:08:22] among his people with a love affair and
[2:08:25] he's pouring out into her himself and to
[2:08:28] becoming one for the wedding supper at
[2:08:31] the same signs and Promises by the same
[2:08:33] God in the same word is making his same
[2:08:37] manifestations
[2:08:39] and there's nothing left for us to do
[2:08:41] but believe it
[2:08:44] Hallelujah you don't have to go to
[2:08:46] Calgary for it and die on a cross amen
[2:08:49] all you got to do is believe it and
[2:08:51] receive it for yourself
[2:08:53] and as God promised Sarah restoration
[2:08:56] necessary to bring forth Isaac so as God
[2:08:59] sent his spirit
[2:09:01] and he's now using dust
[2:09:04] human flesh
[2:09:06] to bring us a message
[2:09:09] to speak his word through
[2:09:11] now God has done this in this last day
[2:09:15] as he did in Genesis and now he's
[2:09:18] revealing the very Mysteries that God as
[2:09:20] he says to Abraham shall I hide from
[2:09:23] Abraham the thing that I do
[2:09:25] and he begins to give him what he will
[2:09:30] do down at Sodom what he will do for
[2:09:33] Abraham's seed what he will do as far as
[2:09:37] given the inheritance he gives us all to
[2:09:40] Abraham as he stands there God using
[2:09:44] flesh to appear to Abraham and Sarah
[2:09:47] and now bringing them a message
[2:09:50] of the end time that will prophesy and
[2:09:54] speak of what God will do in the end
[2:09:57] time
[2:09:58] that God again will use human flesh
[2:10:01] and God must bring a message to us now
[2:10:05] this flesh would not be deity it would
[2:10:07] be a man
[2:10:09] it would be a prophet and God would use
[2:10:11] a prophet to bring a message and that
[2:10:14] message would be one of restoration
[2:10:17] and and there it would reveal to us the
[2:10:20] mystery and that's why we speak of
[2:10:22] Brothers Ministry the third phase of the
[2:10:25] prophet's Ministry is the opening of the
[2:10:28] word
[2:10:30] have you received it
[2:10:34] I have
[2:10:36] in anointed once at the end time he said
[2:10:38] not when he starts on the message
[2:10:40] but when he begins to declare his
[2:10:42] message
[2:10:44] when the first poll heal and second Paul
[2:10:47] prophesied third pull the opening of the
[2:10:49] word the Mysteries revealed no more
[2:10:51] there's no more higher order to reveal
[2:10:54] the word than prophets but the only way
[2:10:56] a prophet can be Vindicated is by the
[2:10:58] word remember the third poll was the
[2:11:00] opening of them Seven Seals to reveal
[2:11:03] the Hidden Truths that's been sealed in
[2:11:06] the word
[2:11:07] so he tells us in perfect Faith this is
[2:11:10] coming to that third pull
[2:11:13] this is just now starting to bloom
[2:11:16] it's just started among listen listen it
[2:11:20] was still the third pull was still in
[2:11:22] his infancy
[2:11:24] it was just now starting to bloom he
[2:11:26] said I just did this for a purpose I I
[2:11:29] did this for purpose I'm working out
[2:11:31] something has taken this charge of faith
[2:11:34] and going right there and bring it out
[2:11:35] and how to come in to kind of raise
[2:11:37] faith in a bracket where you never
[2:11:39] noticed it before not of Faith but the
[2:11:41] perfect Faith built up in here and what
[2:11:43] took perfect god with a perfect heart
[2:11:45] would keep a perfect Promise by a
[2:11:47] perfect word which is separate than a
[2:11:49] two-edged sword and Discerning the
[2:11:51] thoughts of the heart and we're now
[2:11:53] coming to Perfection because the people
[2:11:55] have to come to this in order for the
[2:11:57] Rapture and that's what's holding it
[2:11:59] away right now is waiting for the church
[2:12:01] to come into that perfect raptured faith
[2:12:05] I'm looking for it and it means a lot of
[2:12:09] shaking down for me
[2:12:11] it means a lot for you
[2:12:13] but together we'll make it by the grace
[2:12:16] of God
[2:12:18] now I want to give something to you
[2:12:20] he said then in his ministry it was only
[2:12:24] just starting
[2:12:27] to bloom
[2:12:30] wow to bring forth fruits it's got to
[2:12:32] bloom
[2:12:35] amen but you don't go pick the blossoms
[2:12:39] it goes from Blossom to seed
[2:12:42] amen and he said I'm looking for a
[2:12:45] perfect raptured faith
[2:12:48] now
[2:12:49] so he said why I've done this why I've
[2:12:52] had this prayer line well I've discern
[2:12:54] the thoughts and intents of heart why
[2:12:56] I've done this is to raise Faith up to a
[2:12:59] bracket that you've never noticed that
[2:13:01] way before not a faith but a perfect
[2:13:04] faith now I want you to think right now
[2:13:07] right now what has God been doing even
[2:13:09] in our prayer lines
[2:13:12] amen even in the ministry of the word
[2:13:14] what's it been doing Discerning the
[2:13:16] hearts
[2:13:18] is that right am I dealing with
[2:13:21] situations what if to raise things up
[2:13:23] into a bracket
[2:13:26] not for you to stay there but for you to
[2:13:29] receive a perfect Rapture in faith
[2:13:33] you see where we're at is not the goal
[2:13:37] to have a miracle now and then or
[2:13:40] healing now and then that's not the goal
[2:13:42] even even to have some devil cast out
[2:13:45] now and then that's not the goal but
[2:13:47] what our goal is is to come into that
[2:13:49] perfect raptured Faith but this is
[2:13:52] giving faith for that
[2:13:55] it's causing Faith to rise
[2:14:03] you look back Even in our own church
[2:14:06] why even the rise of Faith you're talked
[2:14:09] about around the world
[2:14:10] you're talked about as a church of Faith
[2:14:13] where miracles happen
[2:14:16] people bring their demons here to get
[2:14:18] them cast out
[2:14:22] people even bring them to our youth camp
[2:14:24] to get them cast out
[2:14:26] and it works
[2:14:27] it happens
[2:14:29] amen why because it raises Faith they
[2:14:32] see God heals
[2:14:35] God delivers
[2:14:37] amen God God sets free you know God God
[2:14:41] heals cancer
[2:14:43] God heals brain bleeds
[2:14:45] God our God heals crippled children
[2:14:49] God heals blinded eyes
[2:14:51] I'm not talking about out yet or I'm
[2:14:54] talking about right here
[2:14:55] God heals kidneys
[2:15:00] takes a boy that would have been a
[2:15:02] little little red not not able to grow
[2:15:05] at all and make a strong healthy boy out
[2:15:08] of it by Recreation
[2:15:12] created in him a new a new kidney
[2:15:18] I'm talking about God working
[2:15:21] but it's only being done to what to
[2:15:24] raise your faith up to a bracket
[2:15:28] not for you to stop there
[2:15:31] but for you to contend
[2:15:34] for that perfect faith for that Rapture
[2:15:37] in faith
[2:15:43] don't be satisfied with what God has
[2:15:45] done
[2:15:49] look at what God is doing
[2:15:52] but at the same time let's go on further
[2:15:56] listen brother Madam said in the message
[2:15:58] indictment made her come forth the
[2:16:00] Revival of the just
[2:16:02] that means righteous
[2:16:04] should be able to say you are by the
[2:16:06] blood May there come forth the Revival
[2:16:09] of the righteous and a great power come
[2:16:11] among the church just before it's going
[2:16:15] how many believes we're there just
[2:16:17] before it's going it's not hard to pray
[2:16:20] for that he says because you promise it
[2:16:23] and we're looking Lord for that third
[2:16:25] pull that we know that will do great
[2:16:27] things in our midst
[2:16:30] so notice what he said May there come a
[2:16:33] Revival of the just
[2:16:36] among the righteous he said brother Tim
[2:16:38] the world ain't going to see a Revival
[2:16:40] no they won't but you will
[2:16:42] you have not received yet everything God
[2:16:46] has for you
[2:16:50] content
[2:16:55] and he said it's not hard to pray to God
[2:16:58] for that because he promised it
[2:17:01] and we're looking for that third pull to
[2:17:03] do great things
[2:17:05] so you say but brother Tim third pole is
[2:17:08] open to the word it's theology it's a
[2:17:10] it's a word word word no it'll do great
[2:17:13] things
[2:17:15] I want you to get it
[2:17:17] just because you've received the truth
[2:17:21] of the doctrine
[2:17:24] and the message doesn't mean
[2:17:27] you have got it all yet
[2:17:30] that's the mechanics
[2:17:35] when the apostles first obeyed his first
[2:17:37] commission remember this
[2:17:40] remember I've been preaching on
[2:17:42] fulfilling the Great Commission
[2:17:45] denominations can't do that because they
[2:17:47] can't take all the word
[2:17:50] so because it will not receive all the
[2:17:52] faith they'll stay right there with
[2:17:53] their little bit of Faith the Baptist
[2:17:55] Camp right there with their faith of
[2:17:57] immersion Pentecostals with their faith
[2:17:59] and gifts
[2:18:01] the nazarenes with
[2:18:03] well they're losing their Holiness but
[2:18:05] nevertheless Sarah claim it
[2:18:09] they're contending for that they're
[2:18:11] fortified they stopped there they've
[2:18:13] camped around that they've claimed that
[2:18:15] part
[2:18:17] but they hadn't gone all
[2:18:18] what's now his last commission is to
[2:18:22] preach the gospel
[2:18:25] to all the world and then shall the End
[2:18:27] come
[2:18:29] and so he there there again with his
[2:18:33] first commission was in Luke 10 18 where
[2:18:37] Satan fell like a bolt of lightning
[2:18:40] what caused the fall of Satan where it
[2:18:44] was when he gave them Power To Tread on
[2:18:48] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[2:18:51] power of the enemy and nothing by any
[2:18:53] means could harm them
[2:18:56] is that right
[2:18:58] amen and when they drop and they began
[2:19:01] to act upon that commission Satan fell
[2:19:04] like lightning
[2:19:07] his last commission does the same
[2:19:09] by casting out Satan As We Lay hands on
[2:19:13] the sick
[2:19:14] now some will say we don't need laying
[2:19:16] on the hands
[2:19:17] we got the word now you just believe it
[2:19:19] sitting in your seat
[2:19:21] well
[2:19:23] pardon me but Brother Brad him over and
[2:19:25] over and over practice laying on of
[2:19:27] hands
[2:19:29] having the congregate to lay hands on
[2:19:31] each other as he prayed he did this all
[2:19:34] the way to the end of his ministry
[2:19:36] amen you see you see his first
[2:19:39] commission was to heal the sick and he
[2:19:42] the second commission was the last
[2:19:44] commission was to heal the sick lay
[2:19:46] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[2:19:48] but you see Satan wants to bind the
[2:19:51] hands of the church
[2:19:53] with a false theology
[2:19:56] to try to make it wrong to lay hands on
[2:19:59] the sick
[2:20:01] because when Satan is cast out he falls
[2:20:06] like lightning from heaven
[2:20:10] so when we pray for the sick and they're
[2:20:12] healed it brings Satan's fall
[2:20:17] come on Church
[2:20:19] I hope he gets more than a bobo
[2:20:22] amen I'd like to see his nose broke his
[2:20:25] head broke
[2:20:28] amen he could learn he could land on his
[2:20:30] tails for all I care and get his tail
[2:20:31] broke
[2:20:33] but he must be broke
[2:20:36] I'm telling you the devil that is
[2:20:38] tormenting you must be broken
[2:20:43] listen to what I'm saying now brother
[2:20:44] Bradham told us in 1963 in June he said
[2:20:48] he said I want you to believe now for
[2:20:51] healing we know the holy spirit's here
[2:20:52] and I believe in lay it on our hands or
[2:20:55] somebody jumped on me kind of rough
[2:20:57] about that this morning and said there's
[2:21:00] no such a thing as laying hands on one
[2:21:02] another it shouldn't be done
[2:21:06] can you imagine some preachers in the
[2:21:09] message
[2:21:10] now under this same evil spirit
[2:21:14] we're not we're not getting against men
[2:21:16] we're about spirits
[2:21:19] evil spirit that anointed men like
[2:21:22] Alexander Campbell
[2:21:25] with his so-called Church of Christ
[2:21:27] teachings I don't call them Church of
[2:21:29] Christ I call the man of Christ
[2:21:32] but anyway it's so-called Church of
[2:21:34] Christ teaching resisting the Holy Ghost
[2:21:37] and now that same devil jumping on us
[2:21:39] for prayer lines
[2:21:42] where we lay hands on the sick
[2:21:44] and the devil oppressed
[2:21:48] I'm just going to say it this you can't
[2:21:51] stop it
[2:21:53] we're going to matter that Youth Camp
[2:21:56] we have it almost every service here
[2:22:00] come on Church you ain't gonna stop it
[2:22:03] we're contending for it
[2:22:05] [Applause]
[2:22:06] we're fighting for it
[2:22:09] hey man listen here he said he said that
[2:22:12] they said there's no such thing as
[2:22:14] laying hands on one another it shouldn't
[2:22:16] be done I said you just haven't read the
[2:22:20] Bible brother
[2:22:22] and that's what I want to say to some of
[2:22:24] these guys you haven't met or even read
[2:22:27] the message let alone the Bible
[2:22:30] that's all the last the last commission
[2:22:33] that fell from the lips of Jesus was lay
[2:22:35] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[2:22:37] the last words he said when left the
[2:22:40] Earth his first commission he gave the
[2:22:41] disciples was healed the sick cleanse
[2:22:43] the leper raise the Dead cast out Devils
[2:22:45] that's the first group he sent out
[2:22:47] Matthew 10 and the last group he set out
[2:22:50] these signs shall follow them that
[2:22:51] believed they shall cast out Devils
[2:22:53] speak with new tongues take up serpents
[2:22:55] drink deadly things that they lay hands
[2:22:57] on the sick they shall recover that was
[2:22:59] the last words he said and was received
[2:23:01] up in the glory certainly that was a
[2:23:03] great commission what it does I don't
[2:23:05] know it's just carrying out what he said
[2:23:08] do
[2:23:11] hey man I don't know how it works either
[2:23:14] there's no power in my hands no power in
[2:23:18] any preacher's hands I don't know how it
[2:23:21] works but I just know it works
[2:23:25] amen I just know because he said do it
[2:23:28] we do it
[2:23:32] and that's still the commission
[2:23:35] now how
[2:23:37] can anyone now I'm contending
[2:23:40] I'm arguing
[2:23:43] how can anyone be against altar costs
[2:23:46] I'm praying for the sick
[2:23:50] you think that's against Church order
[2:23:54] you obviously hadn't listen to church
[2:23:56] order
[2:24:00] which by the way is not a law but it's a
[2:24:02] guideline
[2:24:04] of how to conduct an orderly church
[2:24:06] service so brother Branham gives some
[2:24:08] points and guides on how to you know you
[2:24:11] know how to conduct an orderly church
[2:24:13] service
[2:24:15] and then and so he taught us
[2:24:18] to conduct a church service you know
[2:24:21] have your songs have the preaching
[2:24:24] and then he said give an all to God
[2:24:27] I'm talking about 1963 church order give
[2:24:31] an altar call by giving an invitation to
[2:24:33] accept Christ
[2:24:35] and and afterwards after that offered
[2:24:38] prayer for the sick
[2:24:40] he says in church order you know there
[2:24:42] as he you make the altar call nobody
[2:24:45] comes you know in a few minutes you say
[2:24:48] well if nobody comes and say well would
[2:24:51] there be somebody that would like to be
[2:24:53] Anointed with oil tonight for sickness
[2:24:55] we pray for the sick here
[2:24:58] woohoo
[2:25:01] amen
[2:25:03] I mean this is church order
[2:25:05] this is how brother Branham taught us to
[2:25:07] conduct a church service
[2:25:09] and make an altar call
[2:25:12] and he said bring him up you don't pray
[2:25:14] with them those except Christ you know
[2:25:17] those that need to linger he said you
[2:25:19] can even take them into a room and pray
[2:25:21] with him some more and then make their
[2:25:23] invitation and say would it be someone
[2:25:25] here that would like to be Anointed with
[2:25:27] oil tonight for sickness we pray for the
[2:25:30] sick here
[2:25:35] but Satan with all this ecclesiastical
[2:25:39] pressure
[2:25:41] trying to stop us from fulfilling the
[2:25:43] Great Commission
[2:25:47] to preach
[2:25:49] preaching's under attack
[2:25:51] Don't Preach just push play
[2:25:54] and Jesus said preach Paul said preach
[2:25:57] brother Brandon said preach
[2:26:01] is that right amen but you see
[2:26:04] ecclesiastical pressure to try to keep
[2:26:07] us from fulfilling the Great Commission
[2:26:09] to preach to cast out Devils to heal the
[2:26:13] sick to speak with new tongues
[2:26:18] amen if Satan with ecclesiastical
[2:26:23] religious through the clergy pressure
[2:26:28] look at the revelation of the trumpets
[2:26:31] you know Israel received opposition and
[2:26:34] persecution from governments of the
[2:26:36] world
[2:26:37] in a physical manner which resulted in
[2:26:40] them being uprooted
[2:26:42] from the lands that they lived in
[2:26:44] Germany Holland all through Europe
[2:26:46] Poland wherever and and being forced
[2:26:50] back to a physical Homeland in the land
[2:26:53] of Israel
[2:26:56] the Jews in Israel today are there
[2:26:59] because of a squeeze
[2:27:04] amen a war broke out
[2:27:08] and exterminated six million of them
[2:27:12] and they said we got to have a Homeland
[2:27:14] for the Jews
[2:27:15] and it forced them out of their lands
[2:27:18] and their homes and ancestral lands
[2:27:20] they've been in there for some of them
[2:27:21] for fifteen hundred two thousand nearly
[2:27:24] two thousand years
[2:27:25] in Germany and Europe and different
[2:27:28] places and they were forced out to go
[2:27:30] back to their Homeland is somebody with
[2:27:33] me but now it doesn't come against the
[2:27:37] bride in a physical manner he told us it
[2:27:40] comes against the bride in an
[2:27:42] ecclesiastical manner
[2:27:45] in other words a religious spirit trying
[2:27:48] to use quotes
[2:27:51] to put a squeeze or pressure on the
[2:27:54] bride
[2:27:57] you know what it will do it'll just
[2:27:59] force you out of those dead places
[2:28:03] amen and get you to a place where
[2:28:06] there's life
[2:28:07] let me go to Homeland where the Bible is
[2:28:10] preached where the mighty healing
[2:28:13] happens where Miracles take place where
[2:28:16] the Holy Ghost can be given
[2:28:21] so it comes against the bride in
[2:28:23] ecclesiastical
[2:28:25] ecclesiastical manner a religious spirit
[2:28:28] trying to use quotes or scriptures
[2:28:32] putting a squeeze or pressure on the
[2:28:35] bride
[2:28:36] and it will only serve to force the
[2:28:39] bride from man's Traditions back to the
[2:28:43] homeland of the Bible
[2:28:46] and what it is it may seem harsh
[2:28:50] and man it seemed harsh brother random
[2:28:52] said to uproot all them Jews
[2:28:56] but he said it was a tender hand of
[2:28:58] Jehovah leading them to the Tree of Life
[2:29:01] you see they had to get there in order
[2:29:05] to receive the Messiah
[2:29:08] amen and he said the same thing that is
[2:29:10] happening here he said ecclesiastical
[2:29:13] pressure is pushing there against the
[2:29:16] bride pushing her out of the systems of
[2:29:18] man back to the homeland of the Bible
[2:29:22] and he said many are uprooted and have
[2:29:25] to leave family and friends and this and
[2:29:27] that the other but he said what is it it
[2:29:29] is the Tinder hand of Jehovah lead you
[2:29:33] to the Tree of Life bringing him back to
[2:29:36] the Homeland where the word of God is
[2:29:38] preaching power
[2:29:40] [Applause]
[2:29:47] like brother Bradham said in the Third
[2:29:49] Exodus
[2:29:50] the people were in Egypt
[2:29:52] in the days of
[2:29:54] Joseph remember they were there and our
[2:29:57] days of Moses they've been there for 400
[2:30:00] years why was he in Egypt
[2:30:02] there was a reason they got in bondage
[2:30:04] how come they became slaves the people
[2:30:06] of God became slaves
[2:30:08] why would they be in that land and out
[2:30:11] of their land
[2:30:13] God had promised Abraham I'll give you
[2:30:16] this loud
[2:30:18] this is it
[2:30:19] why wouldn't be the people be in the
[2:30:21] place that God provided
[2:30:24] and he says that's the question of today
[2:30:26] also God gave us a Pentecost
[2:30:30] he gave us a book of Acts he gave us the
[2:30:33] Holy Spirit to lead and guide us he gave
[2:30:35] us a land and why are we out of it why
[2:30:38] is the church out of it why isn't the
[2:30:40] great Christian church today living
[2:30:42] again like the book of Acts bringing
[2:30:45] forth the same thing there's some reason
[2:30:47] for it
[2:30:50] Anna you know what the reason was since
[2:30:52] was because of the dirty jealousy
[2:30:56] toward a brother
[2:30:59] why did they hate him
[2:31:01] because he was a brother no not exactly
[2:31:04] they hated him because God dealt with
[2:31:06] him more than he did the rest of them
[2:31:10] and they didn't want his gifts
[2:31:13] they didn't want his dreams they
[2:31:15] rejected his Supernatural of our
[2:31:18] intellectual conception and that's why
[2:31:21] today so many are out of the land of
[2:31:23] milk and honey where Miracles flow
[2:31:26] freely and the sick are healed and
[2:31:28] tormented Spirits can't stay
[2:31:32] and brother Bradham goes on to say
[2:31:35] they thought they would never need him
[2:31:39] they thought they would never need this
[2:31:42] Supernatural
[2:31:44] this Holy Spirit he types Joseph to the
[2:31:46] Holy Spirit
[2:31:47] we don't need speakers with tongues we
[2:31:50] don't need interpreters or tongues
[2:31:51] they've adopted a man-made system to
[2:31:54] take the place of the Holy Spirit
[2:31:55] therefore there is a people that's
[2:31:59] elected that has their names on the
[2:32:01] Lamb's Book of Life they can't go for
[2:32:04] that they are spiritual minded and
[2:32:07] therefore they can't go for that they
[2:32:09] can't stand it
[2:32:11] Hallelujah I believe that's the bride of
[2:32:14] Christ today a man that are elected
[2:32:16] their names are in the Lamb's Book of
[2:32:18] Life they can't stand that
[2:32:21] amen so they have to get out of there
[2:32:23] get to Homeland somewhere get back to
[2:32:26] the Bible get back to the message well
[2:32:29] man where the faith is contended for
[2:32:34] for the bride of Christ
[2:32:36] it is an ecclesiastical spirit
[2:32:39] that is uniting against the work of God
[2:32:43] opposing the Holy Spirit opposing altar
[2:32:47] calls
[2:32:48] denying the experience of the baptism of
[2:32:50] the Holy Ghost
[2:32:52] replacing it with a cold intellectual
[2:32:55] form of belief
[2:32:58] I hear it all the time oh brother champ
[2:33:01] brother Tim one of the restored
[2:33:03] Mysteries
[2:33:05] one of the restored Mysteries is the
[2:33:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[2:33:09] Sensations without emotions or without
[2:33:12] feelings
[2:33:13] that's a lie
[2:33:16] and it isn't message Doctrine
[2:33:18] it's actually Baptist Doctrine
[2:33:22] it's a part of a quote
[2:33:24] like said the one Satan used to try and
[2:33:27] trip up Jesus upon the Mount of
[2:33:29] Temptation
[2:33:30] and when Satan uses a quote you better
[2:33:32] watch out
[2:33:34] it's not the word it's a twisted with an
[2:33:36] implied meaning something different from
[2:33:38] the Bible
[2:33:40] and brother Brandon said I'm not much
[2:33:43] for dead things by the way this is after
[2:33:45] the seals so I'm not much for dead
[2:33:48] things so anything without emotion is
[2:33:50] dead the scientific research will prove
[2:33:53] that anything without emotion so if your
[2:33:56] experience hasn't got a little emotion
[2:33:59] in it you better bury it and get
[2:34:01] something that has got some emotion in
[2:34:03] it
[2:34:06] amen the restored mystery lays in the
[2:34:10] second part of the quote
[2:34:12] which declares the person of Christ
[2:34:16] performing in you
[2:34:18] the same works that he did
[2:34:20] and what were the works that Jesus said
[2:34:22] that we would do speaking with tongues
[2:34:25] heal the sin cast out devils
[2:34:28] amen but you see when you deny laying on
[2:34:32] our hands and deny speaking with tongues
[2:34:35] and deny the power of the spirit and
[2:34:38] deny the power of the of of casting out
[2:34:41] Devils then that's where you see that
[2:34:44] ecclesiastical Spirit begin to put a
[2:34:48] pressure on the bride
[2:34:53] now John 14 12 said the works that I do
[2:34:58] shall you do also
[2:35:01] and you hear it all the time from these
[2:35:04] false prophets
[2:35:05] just receive the message and believe it
[2:35:07] you got the Holy Ghost
[2:35:09] that's evidence oh sure you will say man
[2:35:12] you will agree with all the word but if
[2:35:14] the signs don't follow it's just an
[2:35:17] intellectual conception
[2:35:20] and because what they're preaching has
[2:35:22] no power then they have to replace the
[2:35:25] power with psychology to treat the
[2:35:28] symptoms of sin rather than the
[2:35:32] old-fashioned sin killer devil destroyed
[2:35:35] holy ghost power to cast Satan out
[2:35:40] and as ecclesiastical pressure against
[2:35:43] the bride of Christ and it comes from
[2:35:46] preachers
[2:35:48] that are comfortable with the anointing
[2:35:51] on the ministry
[2:35:53] but don't want it on the laity
[2:35:55] because they can't control it
[2:36:00] remember
[2:36:02] that now though it's not time for the
[2:36:06] actual forcing of the mark
[2:36:08] and I'm going to lay some things here
[2:36:09] just in the next few minutes
[2:36:15] though it's not time for the mark of the
[2:36:17] beast
[2:36:19] the actual Mark him
[2:36:20] it happens after the bride is gone
[2:36:25] but there is a spirit of unity
[2:36:29] of ecumunism
[2:36:32] to unify
[2:36:34] try to unify the bride and message
[2:36:37] people
[2:36:38] with the teachings of denomination
[2:36:43] this is what happened when psychology is
[2:36:45] brought in
[2:36:46] it's unified bringing in their methods
[2:36:51] to try to conform and reform
[2:36:54] rather than the power of transformation
[2:36:58] so I want you to understand you know
[2:37:01] when the bride is gone there will be the
[2:37:04] actual forcing of the mark of the beast
[2:37:07] but right now there is a spirit of Unity
[2:37:10] on at communism that is affecting the
[2:37:14] minds of the people remember the Bible
[2:37:16] tells you that they will all give their
[2:37:19] mind to the Beast
[2:37:25] and it's a cord of of so-called
[2:37:28] tolerance
[2:37:29] that is binding the people together and
[2:37:33] acceptance of evil
[2:37:35] and forcing you to call it good
[2:37:40] and it's a move to make unbelief
[2:37:42] acceptable
[2:37:44] and that bind together against the Holy
[2:37:47] Ghost against the gifts of the Spirit
[2:37:49] against Power God's power to seal for an
[2:37:52] easy believism will just believe the
[2:37:54] message
[2:37:55] yours you're sealed
[2:37:59] now brother Branham called it a boycott
[2:38:03] it's what we call today a council
[2:38:06] culture
[2:38:10] so you cancel anyone or anything that
[2:38:14] dares oppose you
[2:38:17] remember it's not physical yet it's
[2:38:20] spiritual
[2:38:22] like brother Brandon said about in
[2:38:23] Satan's Eden about men and women wearing
[2:38:26] shorts he said they belong to a society
[2:38:29] whether they know it or not they're
[2:38:31] perverted and don't know it they're
[2:38:33] spiritually belong to it and don't know
[2:38:35] it
[2:38:36] that's what he said
[2:38:38] and you can spiritually belong to
[2:38:40] something and don't even realize
[2:38:43] you belong to it it's a binding remember
[2:38:46] there is a binding going on God's going
[2:38:49] to take a weed into the gardener but the
[2:38:51] tares will be burned are bound together
[2:38:55] amen and now I want you to notice it's a
[2:38:58] uniting and people spiritually belong to
[2:39:02] it and don't realize it
[2:39:08] now I'm trying to show you we're trying
[2:39:10] to uncover
[2:39:12] so that you can see what you're
[2:39:13] contending for
[2:39:16] because Satan wants you to convince it's
[2:39:19] a move of God it is not a move of God it
[2:39:22] is never a move of God when we have to
[2:39:24] have our men have classes week after
[2:39:27] week after week to teach them against
[2:39:29] sexual uh habits
[2:39:31] that is not a move of God that is a move
[2:39:35] of EC communism
[2:39:37] to make you like the rest of them
[2:39:40] because that's the power denomination
[2:39:41] the power of the Gospel changes the
[2:39:44] nature
[2:39:47] amen we don't need we don't need weeks
[2:39:50] and weeks and weeks of that we need a
[2:39:54] getting in the presence of God and
[2:39:56] getting delivered from the power of sin
[2:40:00] and the changing of the nature
[2:40:04] but Satan comes along and he wants to
[2:40:07] bind together
[2:40:10] because this is what he's doing in this
[2:40:12] age he's binding
[2:40:15] tears all together
[2:40:19] and he uses we're all the same you know
[2:40:24] message churches become famous
[2:40:26] denominations there's no healing there
[2:40:28] either
[2:40:30] there's no Miracles there either
[2:40:33] there's no experience in the Holy Ghost
[2:40:35] there either
[2:40:38] what have they done they've been brought
[2:40:40] into a court and they're being united
[2:40:42] with this
[2:40:44] instead of this
[2:40:46] the word
[2:40:49] follow my thoughts now
[2:40:52] listen to brother Branham spoken word's
[2:40:54] Original Seed I predict the two
[2:40:57] Pentecost the two denominational groups
[2:40:59] Pentecostal and Evangelical groups will
[2:41:02] work together in a denomination I
[2:41:04] predict they're going to work together
[2:41:05] watch they will unite themselves
[2:41:08] together and become a member of them all
[2:41:10] of them are the Federation of the
[2:41:12] Council of churches or the Council of
[2:41:14] churches they already belong to it all
[2:41:16] of them and they will come through them
[2:41:18] a forcing or a boycott that will stop
[2:41:22] everything but what belongs to that
[2:41:24] Union of churches the Bible said there
[2:41:26] would be a boycott even to such a way it
[2:41:30] would cause people to not be to buy or
[2:41:33] sell unless it received the mark this
[2:41:36] the mark of the beast which is romanism
[2:41:38] the image of the Beast which is
[2:41:40] protestantism the Beast had Power
[2:41:42] Authority to give image the image life
[2:41:45] to speak and it did that's the
[2:41:47] confederation of churches when they
[2:41:48] Confederate themselves together now
[2:41:51] there's many young people here I don't
[2:41:53] know Jesus may come this afternoon he
[2:41:55] may come next year I don't know when
[2:41:56] he's coming but remember if I don't live
[2:41:58] to see that day of his coming which I
[2:42:01] hope I will and somehow believe I will
[2:42:03] now I if I don't see it don't let this
[2:42:07] word ever depart from your ears and your
[2:42:10] heart remember I speak in the name of
[2:42:12] the Lord I believe with all my heart
[2:42:15] that that's a way to wind up there will
[2:42:17] be like a union a boycott and all places
[2:42:20] as this will be closed down and you'll
[2:42:23] not be able to speak unless you've got a
[2:42:25] permission or license from this
[2:42:28] Federation of churches to hold his
[2:42:29] service it shows it does that now even
[2:42:33] in the denomination it shows where it's
[2:42:35] at yes sir you have to have it and
[2:42:37] that's where it'll wind up that's my
[2:42:39] prediction as a servant of Christ to the
[2:42:42] understanding I have of the word and the
[2:42:44] inspiration that's where it'll come from
[2:42:47] all signs are pointing to the end
[2:42:51] hmm
[2:42:53] and yet
[2:42:55] you don't see yet
[2:42:58] much action amongst the council at
[2:43:00] church
[2:43:04] you don't see yet
[2:43:06] but remember
[2:43:08] it doesn't become physical
[2:43:11] until the bride leaves
[2:43:15] so now it's ecclesiastical
[2:43:22] and ecclesiastical is using scriptures
[2:43:25] and quotes
[2:43:26] to try to force the Holy Spirit out
[2:43:33] now brother Bradham said in the spoken
[2:43:36] words Original Seed he said I believe
[2:43:38] someday the real real bride of Christ
[2:43:40] will be forced to stop preaching the
[2:43:43] word of God now what in the world then
[2:43:45] do we have that's coming from
[2:43:47] Jeffersonville
[2:43:49] of forcing to try to stop the preaching
[2:43:54] of the word of God
[2:43:56] what is it what is it what do you see
[2:43:58] the Bible prophesied something that he
[2:44:00] said in Romans Revelation 13 16 you want
[2:44:03] to put it down denominations will force
[2:44:06] it to stop or take its Mark but then
[2:44:09] when the lamb will take his pride and
[2:44:11] judge The Horde for it
[2:44:13] so we're right here in the time where
[2:44:16] they don't want you to preach no more
[2:44:18] do you realize the last gift we've
[2:44:22] already done away with speaking in
[2:44:24] tongues and prophecy and and we've
[2:44:26] already done away with discernment of
[2:44:28] spirits and miracles and Gifts of
[2:44:30] healing it's already been done away with
[2:44:32] in the church
[2:44:34] and now the last gift which is inspired
[2:44:36] preaching
[2:44:38] here Satan comes for the last gift and
[2:44:41] what's he want to do squeeze the life
[2:44:43] out of the preachers
[2:44:46] that they dare not stand in the pulpit
[2:44:49] and preach
[2:44:50] when Jesus told us to preach
[2:44:54] when the last commission is to breach
[2:44:57] come on and somebody's got to fulfill it
[2:45:01] say brother Tim what are you doing I'm
[2:45:03] contending for the faith
[2:45:07] I'm contending for what Paul said preach
[2:45:10] the word
[2:45:12] be Infinite season out of season you
[2:45:15] know rebuke with all on suffering and
[2:45:17] Doctrine
[2:45:22] but he said in that time the Lord God
[2:45:25] the lamb will take his bride and judge
[2:45:27] the horror now right now you don't see
[2:45:30] it happening by the government
[2:45:33] but the mechanics
[2:45:36] wake up just a moment look at your
[2:45:38] neighbor and just say this word
[2:45:40] mechanics
[2:45:42] mechanics really damn what in the world
[2:45:45] are you talking about
[2:45:46] the mechanics
[2:45:48] for it to happen is in place
[2:45:55] what you see is the spirit rising up
[2:45:59] and ecclesiastical spirit that tries to
[2:46:03] force us to stop preaching
[2:46:06] denying us denying the commandment and
[2:46:10] commission of Jesus
[2:46:12] to go into all the world and preach the
[2:46:14] gospel why is it is Satan's attempt to
[2:46:17] stop mark 16.
[2:46:21] keep in mind the mark of the beast and
[2:46:23] the fortune of the Mark is not yet
[2:46:26] physical and it won't be enforced until
[2:46:29] the bride leaves but however there's a
[2:46:31] spirit already at work
[2:46:34] and it's bringing a union or a boycott
[2:46:37] or a council culture of the truth
[2:46:40] now what's the spirit also at work in
[2:46:43] the churches to to enforce a cancer
[2:46:46] culture a boycott I mean it's even
[2:46:49] working in our nation if you're a baker
[2:46:52] and you don't want to bake a cake for a
[2:46:54] gay wedding you'll be canceled
[2:46:57] your your business will be ruined
[2:47:00] amen it's a it's a you're 19 against the
[2:47:03] word
[2:47:06] amen Michael and Beth had a little uh
[2:47:09] campus business of of putting photos on
[2:47:12] the canvas and I had to stop it you know
[2:47:14] why
[2:47:16] because they're beginning to get
[2:47:18] requests to do gay weddings
[2:47:22] and if you don't do it you're sued
[2:47:27] and you're canceled
[2:47:29] now you know so you see it what is it it
[2:47:32] is a spirit in our nation uniting
[2:47:36] against the word and making the word of
[2:47:39] God seem to be evil and wrong and evil
[2:47:43] righteous
[2:47:45] and it brings a canceled culture against
[2:47:49] now I'm I'm taking right now look at
[2:47:52] what's happening you you think well
[2:47:53] brother Tim you know they it's just
[2:47:56] something going on there tearing down
[2:47:57] our statues and you know monuments and
[2:48:00] this and that and our history what is
[2:48:02] happening there you know there is a
[2:48:04] there is a work in our nation to destroy
[2:48:07] patriotism
[2:48:11] they don't want you patriotic for
[2:48:14] America burn your flags America's evil
[2:48:18] Americans have the evil past you know we
[2:48:21] are not to be Patriots you know why
[2:48:24] because they're canceling out patriotism
[2:48:27] for a one world government
[2:48:34] and everybody is starting to give their
[2:48:36] minds to this
[2:48:40] you know if you don't go along with it
[2:48:43] you're canceled
[2:48:44] you know there's church shooting that
[2:48:46] just happened the other day this sickle
[2:48:48] transgender
[2:48:50] um I don't know whether it was a god
[2:48:51] pretending to be a girl or girl
[2:48:53] pretending to be a boy I never figured
[2:48:54] it out
[2:48:55] it was a girl pretending to be a boy
[2:49:00] and now they're calling it a martyr
[2:49:05] a martyr
[2:49:06] after killing three teachers and or two
[2:49:09] teachers and a custodian and three
[2:49:11] children
[2:49:12] it's insanity
[2:49:16] now that's a martyr
[2:49:19] you know you know because that
[2:49:21] individual had been hurt and nobody
[2:49:23] would accept it
[2:49:25] if you don't go along with it you're
[2:49:27] canceled so if you preach Divine Healing
[2:49:29] you'll be canceled
[2:49:31] If You Preach or believe in the Holy
[2:49:33] Ghost and that it must be an experience
[2:49:35] and not just an acquired knowledge of
[2:49:38] the message you will be canceled
[2:49:41] If You Preach it's gifts it's Miracles
[2:49:43] you will be canceled even crucified
[2:49:50] so brother Branham told us
[2:49:52] there that that they are coming together
[2:49:55] now watch he said you will not be even
[2:49:59] allowed to preach or allowed to have
[2:50:01] prayer for the sick and we're seeing the
[2:50:04] same thing begin to happen against the
[2:50:07] bride of Christ Don't Preach don't pray
[2:50:10] for the sick
[2:50:12] and that crucifies the Vindicated Word
[2:50:16] of Promise it stops it you're not
[2:50:18] allowed to have it no more no more
[2:50:19] healing Services no more prayer for the
[2:50:21] city no sir you can't do it
[2:50:24] and that's what brother Bradham told us
[2:50:26] he said it was rising up right there and
[2:50:28] you see the same spirit that is
[2:50:31] anointing those of the world begin to
[2:50:33] anoint those
[2:50:35] who claim to be in the truth
[2:50:39] now I'm trying to bring something
[2:50:42] brother Branham said
[2:50:44] they've already got
[2:50:46] the machine has been set up and ready to
[2:50:49] move the mechanics is already there
[2:50:51] they've already got the mechanical
[2:50:53] system of an organization that's going
[2:50:55] to bring up on the earth a piece they
[2:50:57] say like a U.N
[2:51:00] and he said hey then he goes on and he
[2:51:02] said that you know he goes on and he
[2:51:05] talks about how the big machine is set
[2:51:08] up and now we are seeing it over and
[2:51:10] over and over and over again do you see
[2:51:12] the protests that were just made here
[2:51:15] the other day where people were actually
[2:51:17] Protestants and and standing for
[2:51:19] pro-life and here they get assaulted by
[2:51:22] an evil group
[2:51:23] you know what and and there's no defense
[2:51:26] for them but they would defend the other
[2:51:28] side that's a hate crime but to stand
[2:51:30] for up for righteousness no the police
[2:51:32] just stand by and let it happen
[2:51:35] you see that right now it is a spirit
[2:51:39] but but it's going to be it will one day
[2:51:44] get its Dynamics
[2:51:46] when the bride is raptured
[2:51:49] and right now you can already see the
[2:51:52] mechanics is there now then you're
[2:51:54] seeing the Dynamics begin to move
[2:51:57] is somebody with me now amen you can see
[2:52:00] it beginning to move laws are being
[2:52:02] changed
[2:52:03] prosecutors being put into place that
[2:52:07] are bought with money already that that
[2:52:09] will not even prosecute criminals all
[2:52:12] these things that are going on in our
[2:52:14] nation I was listening to a report
[2:52:16] yesterday in 10 years there has been a 4
[2:52:20] 000 percent increase of transgenders
[2:52:25] and a mutilation of America's children
[2:52:29] where that boys are mutilated there and
[2:52:33] neutered and and and and and their
[2:52:36] organs removed and girls are are
[2:52:38] sterilized and their breasts removed at
[2:52:41] 13 years old without parental without
[2:52:45] parental consent and this kind of thing
[2:52:48] is happening in our nation
[2:52:53] you know why because right now we see
[2:52:56] the Dynamics
[2:52:58] is starting to move
[2:53:01] in the mechanics
[2:53:04] and they're all one mind
[2:53:07] oh you know tolerance
[2:53:10] you know nobody should stand up against
[2:53:13] it or or whatever else and brother
[2:53:16] Branham tells us he said you'll find out
[2:53:18] there be affiliation the Pentecostals
[2:53:21] the groups will come together and
[2:53:22] they'll set the doors on them guys that
[2:53:24] won't listen to it and you want to be
[2:53:26] allowed to open your mouth right but
[2:53:29] that's when he'll come that's when he'll
[2:53:32] show that's when you'll see a ray
[2:53:36] Hallelujah and he said somebody's got to
[2:53:39] stand up for this he said like Patrick
[2:53:41] Henry said Give me liberty or give me
[2:53:44] death
[2:53:45] somebody has to stand up for it and he
[2:53:47] said if the Holy Ghost is a saint Holy
[2:53:50] Ghost and fell at Pentecost it still
[2:53:52] does the same things it did there the
[2:53:55] same power The Same Spirit it'll work
[2:53:57] the same way we don't need a council of
[2:53:59] churches we need the Bible back in
[2:54:02] action
[2:54:02] [Applause]
[2:54:05] you can see what's happening in Gomorrah
[2:54:08] our our sister Country Canada
[2:54:12] we're Sodom their gemara
[2:54:15] our next door neighbor
[2:54:17] raisin with pressure against religion
[2:54:20] a young man the other day arrested for
[2:54:23] saying what the Bible says
[2:54:25] at a Christian School at a Catholic
[2:54:27] School
[2:54:29] some of his classmates young girls came
[2:54:31] up to him and said listen listen now we
[2:54:35] we are we're we're afraid because
[2:54:38] men are using our bathrooms
[2:54:41] and we're afraid they're calling us up
[2:54:44] females by the way they sent one of
[2:54:46] these so-called females to a female
[2:54:48] prison and wound up with about 10 or 12
[2:54:50] pregnancies
[2:54:54] so you know here here again this young
[2:54:57] man in school he just stood up and said
[2:55:00] what the Bible said
[2:55:02] the Bible said you know against that
[2:55:05] that men and women are different and and
[2:55:08] he stood up for his female classmates
[2:55:10] who were complaining that biological
[2:55:12] males were used in their bathroom and
[2:55:14] he's been thrown out of the high school
[2:55:16] and arrested them
[2:55:20] and you look what's happening in the
[2:55:22] schools of America
[2:55:24] transgender curriculum forced on our
[2:55:27] kids drag queen chose forced on our kids
[2:55:31] and corrupt judges striking it down when
[2:55:34] laws are passed to stop them
[2:55:37] brother Bradham looked for a squeeze I'm
[2:55:40] going to tell you you're in it
[2:55:47] yet we know
[2:55:50] it was revealed in the trumpets we won't
[2:55:53] go through the persecution dearly Church
[2:55:56] did
[2:55:57] and don't get confused with what happens
[2:55:59] to the foolish virgins who are hunted
[2:56:01] down by the Dragon
[2:56:02] but let me tell you they are setting up
[2:56:05] and bringing the order setting the stage
[2:56:07] for the mark of the beast and she is
[2:56:09] rising in power
[2:56:11] as we head toward it a one world
[2:56:14] government with Satan at its head
[2:56:17] look it's what's happening in just in
[2:56:19] the last few years since covet seemed
[2:56:22] like ever Calamity they use it whether
[2:56:24] it was 9-1-1 to use it to take away
[2:56:26] freedoms
[2:56:28] then it comes along the covet and they
[2:56:30] learn another way how far they can push
[2:56:32] the American people and the rights it
[2:56:33] can take away from them
[2:56:35] you know that remember were there two
[2:56:38] people in jail because they dare to have
[2:56:40] church
[2:56:43] luckily we had a we had a man who was a
[2:56:46] president that said freedom of religion
[2:56:48] is in our country and nobody's being
[2:56:51] shut down to go to church
[2:56:53] and so you know but but look at our
[2:56:55] money our money your money is Vanishing

[3:00:02] [Applause]
[3:00:04] what lays in the word people want to
[3:00:08] talk about the opening of the word well
[3:00:10] you know the what the Bible has been
[3:00:12] opened what lays in the word the power
[3:00:15] of Creation The Power of Salvation this
[3:00:17] is in the third poll the power of
[3:00:20] creation the power salvation the power
[3:00:23] of Resurrection the power control and
[3:00:25] atmosphere the power of healing that's
[3:00:28] what lays in the word
[3:00:35] president random said right now just as
[3:00:38] this time has happened so you can
[3:00:39] identify its presence among you but it
[3:00:42] won't be used in a great way to this
[3:00:44] Council begins to tighten up
[3:00:47] do you feel it tightening
[3:00:49] but when that time comes when the
[3:00:51] squeeze comes down
[3:00:53] then you'll see what you've seen
[3:00:55] temporarily or be manifested in the
[3:00:57] fullness of its power
[3:01:00] the move is on for the bride
[3:01:03] and for the bride leaves it must
[3:01:06] manifest faith in its full Dynamics
[3:01:11] and brother Benham tells us and I'm
[3:01:13] closing on this as I bring it right down
[3:01:16] in there to this this morning
[3:01:19] Satan is there with the mechanics
[3:01:22] and he said he's only waiting for the
[3:01:25] Dynamics
[3:01:28] and I'm telling you what we see here in
[3:01:31] the evil that is going on is only
[3:01:33] temporary
[3:01:35] compared to what will be expressed in
[3:01:38] the tribulation
[3:01:40] if you are left behind or you will be
[3:01:43] hunted down and you will be exterminated
[3:01:46] and killed
[3:01:48] amen you will
[3:01:50] do you hear what the Bible said we will
[3:01:53] in Revelation 11 it says you will
[3:01:56] amen said that that could be sir that
[3:01:59] that there would would open the dragon
[3:02:02] would would come and open his mouth
[3:02:04] against Israel a war like a flood and
[3:02:08] then he said an earthquake would take
[3:02:10] place you know what that is that's
[3:02:12] Armageddon
[3:02:13] that's when God comes and Christ sets
[3:02:16] his foot upon the Mount of olive
[3:02:18] and it Cleaves him too and there's a
[3:02:21] great battle are you with me it's a
[3:02:24] battle of Armageddon that takes place
[3:02:26] but he said when he can't get to Israel
[3:02:29] he turns him and puts his Venom against
[3:02:32] the remnant of the woman's seed
[3:02:35] there is coming a great persecution
[3:02:38] there is coming a Great Tribulation you
[3:02:41] do not want to be left behind here
[3:02:46] can you see the Dynamics begin to work
[3:02:49] in Satan's mechanics
[3:02:52] that ought to tell you something
[3:02:55] let me drive this home right now let me
[3:02:58] tell you right now if you see the
[3:03:00] Dynamics begin to work in Satan's
[3:03:03] mechanics
[3:03:04] then you'll either be able to recognize
[3:03:07] the Dynamics is beginning to work if
[3:03:10] God's mechanics
[3:03:13] and the Dynamics of this church will be
[3:03:17] a revealing of the Holy Ghost that they
[3:03:20] have left in a small measure while the
[3:03:22] headstrong was coming down to the body
[3:03:24] but then the full power of the Holy
[3:03:27] Ghost
[3:03:28] will receive of the Dead in Christ
[3:03:31] that's been dead from The Seven Ages
[3:03:34] Hallelujah
[3:03:36] Hallelujah the Dynamics the Holy Ghost
[3:03:39] is coming the Holy Ghost he goes here
[3:03:42] the Holy Ghost he got pouring out and
[3:03:44] what you have seen temporary is only
[3:03:46] going to be manifested in the fullness
[3:03:49] of its power
[3:03:51] Satan can't cancel us Satan can't stop
[3:03:55] us we have been told content earnestly
[3:03:59] could give
[3:04:01] for the faith
[3:04:03] once delivered to the Saints
[3:04:06] God has remembered his promise
[3:04:08] he's pouring out a spirit
[3:04:11] ask him to pour it out on you
[3:04:13] say Lord I need another refreshing of
[3:04:17] the Holy Ghost
[3:04:18] hey man I need a raptured faith I need
[3:04:21] my faith elevated to a higher position
[3:04:24] you're letting things happen among us we
[3:04:27] see the sick healed we see Devils cast
[3:04:30] out we see the captives of three
[3:04:32] but Lord pour into me your spirit
[3:04:39] I said I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[3:04:41] Flesh
[3:04:45] I'll pour it out
[3:04:49] look at his own failing words of promise
[3:04:52] God coming back alone the other night
[3:04:55] telling you I remember
[3:05:01] I stood in Israel
[3:05:03] at Hamas
