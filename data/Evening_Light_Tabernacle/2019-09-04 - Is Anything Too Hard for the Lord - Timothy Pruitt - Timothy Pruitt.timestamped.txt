[30:51] just thanked the Lord for the

[31:12] it's coming in late this evening so a
[31:15] man we're just glad that everyone's back
[31:17] home Amy are you glad to be back home
[31:20] a man Genesis 18 and verse 11 says now
[31:24] Abraham and Sarah were old and well
[31:27] stricken and aged and it ceased to be
[31:29] with Sarah after the manner of women
[31:32] therefore Sarah laugh within herself
[31:34] saying after I am waxed old shall I have
[31:38] pleasure my lord and being old also and
[31:42] the Lord say said unto Abraham wherefore
[31:46] did Sarah laugh say inshallah of a
[31:49] surety bear a child which I'm old
[31:52] is there anything too hard for the Lord
[31:55] and at the time appointed I will return
[31:58] unto thee according to the time of life
[32:01] and Sarah shall have a son
[32:04] Amen we'll let you be seated any men I'd
[32:16] like to speak this evening and have to
[32:18] bear with me a little bit of picked up a
[32:21] little bit of a cold over the tribe will
[32:24] come home with it yesterday but so if I
[32:28] go to snorting or something just bypass
[32:31] all of that Amen it's alright we're here
[32:33] to have church amen amen
[32:36] I just want to speak to you this evening
[32:38] on a thought the Lord it's given me on
[32:40] my way home yesterday is anything too
[32:43] hard for the Lord is anything too hard
[32:46] to the Lord maybe you should ask
[32:48] yourself that question as you think
[32:50] about this week or this last month or
[32:53] whatever you have going on in your life
[32:55] is anything too hard for the Lord and
[32:58] this thing as he said this is the words
[33:01] of God as he would take and he would
[33:03] take dust out of the earth and he would
[33:06] form himself a body to come and walk
[33:08] down him and and to angels as they came
[33:11] to visit
[33:12] Abraham under the shade tree there oh
[33:15] and and and as he can't begin to speak
[33:17] to Abraham now this is the voice of God
[33:20] as he began to speak and he began to
[33:22] give the promise to Sarah now Sarah had
[33:26] been sitting in the tent and she had
[33:28] been maybe having a hard day and going
[33:30] through a lot of things in her life and
[33:31] you know she had heard about how that
[33:33] Abraham was in the promise and how that
[33:36] a per the God was going to give Abraham
[33:38] a son and but here God came to show
[33:41] himself to her and he made this
[33:43] statement is anything too hard for the
[33:46] Lord and and this thing is actually
[33:49] speaking of a word or a speech or in
[33:52] other words is anything that I've said
[33:54] is it too hard for me to bring to pass
[33:56] if I've spoken it I can bring it to pass
[34:00] a man or I would not have said it and
[34:01] God does not say anything that he cannot
[34:04] do or he will not do if God spoke it he
[34:07] has the abilities he has the that the
[34:11] power or whatever it takes to bring it
[34:13] to pass him and this heart is actually
[34:16] meaning to be beyond one's power or be
[34:19] too difficult to do so there's nothing
[34:22] as he says as anything or any word that
[34:25] I spoke to difficult for me to bring to
[34:28] pass now here Abraham was sitting in the
[34:31] door of his tent and it was a real hot
[34:32] day him and it must have been you know
[34:35] very a lot of things going on a lot of
[34:37] complaints have been coming in you know
[34:39] from the herdsman 's and the grass was
[34:41] gone the land was drying up he had
[34:43] separated from Locke because of the
[34:45] water situations him and the cattle was
[34:49] dying and becoming very thin the water
[34:51] supply about gone and it found a few
[34:54] holes that dig a few wells and and still
[34:57] the cattle didn't have enough water to
[34:59] to drink from you know sometimes you
[35:02] know when things seemed to be going
[35:04] wrong you know we know by nature that's
[35:06] the darkest just before days and when
[35:09] things seem to be really going wrong and
[35:11] many times we see disastrous things
[35:13] happening a man we must bear it in our
[35:16] mind that that's when Satan is trying to
[35:18] block the blessing that's coming our way
[35:20] and I'm here to tell you that we are a
[35:23] blessed people we have been prophesied
[35:26] in this hour to be a blessed people
[35:27] blessed are your eyes for you see
[35:29] blessed for your ears that you hear amen
[35:32] we are a blessed people there's you know
[35:35] in this case
[35:36] was trying to tempt them to feel they
[35:38] had done wrong that maybe they made a
[35:39] wrong choice or they had done something
[35:42] wrong and got out of the promise of God
[35:44] and and here he was trying to block the
[35:46] own coming visitation of God that God
[35:49] was going to give Abraham and Sarah you
[35:51] know we're taught in the scriptures that
[35:53] all things work together for the good to
[35:55] them that love God and and so on no
[35:58] matter how bad it seems I mean remember
[36:00] it's working for your good that God is
[36:03] I'm gonna turn it somehow into a
[36:05] blessing God's gonna move it for your
[36:07] good God's gonna take a terrible thing
[36:09] what we deemed to be terrible what we
[36:12] deemed to be impossible God's going to
[36:14] turn it around for our good and I'm glad
[36:16] of that ain't man then I can have that
[36:18] assurance you know maybe Satan's been
[36:20] after your all day but I believe if he's
[36:22] been after it means you're about to get
[36:23] a blessing
[36:25] amen when you when you notice when the
[36:27] meetings are coming up or things that
[36:29] are happening and the special meetings
[36:31] you know you might as well get ready for
[36:32] Satan's gonna come and he's gonna try to
[36:35] cause disturbances he's gonna try to
[36:36] cause disturbance in the church or in a
[36:39] family or whatever he's trying to stop
[36:42] the blessing from getting to you he's
[36:44] trying to stop you from receiving
[36:46] something from God because he knows if
[36:48] that can ever come through then he's
[36:50] lost his power over you amen but see
[36:53] when when he tempts you and he tries to
[36:55] block he's trying what he's trying to
[36:57] get you to disbelieve and the worst
[36:59] thing you can do is disbelief God and
[37:01] the time that you have need of and as
[37:03] soon as you get a little scared maybe
[37:05] I've done the answer I haven't done that
[37:07] that's when Satan's got that blessing
[37:09] conquered and you can't get it as long
[37:11] as Satan makes you think like that he
[37:14] says perhaps if we would just listen to
[37:16] such things as temptations like that and
[37:19] would pay attention to them that we
[37:20] would miss the blessing of God and and
[37:23] tonight if you can get your mind on
[37:25] other things in your mind on a thought
[37:27] or a pattern or something that's going
[37:29] on your life that he will try to distort
[37:32] things into well you see as gloominess
[37:35] and all you see is doubt and all you see
[37:37] it's fear or sickness and trouble or all
[37:39] you see is what's not going right or
[37:41] what's going wrong and all you see is
[37:43] all these things going
[37:45] around you he's trying to block the
[37:47] blessings of God he's trying to get our
[37:50] mind on something else and he tries to
[37:52] get our mind well wait a little longer
[37:54] wait for another service you'll get it
[37:56] another day and it's always a carrot out
[37:58] in front of the horse so to speak but
[38:00] listen God isn't wanting to bring a
[38:02] blessing to you gods wanted to show of
[38:05] himself something to you that you are
[38:07] part of the promise of God listen it
[38:10] ain't just promises in the Bible but God
[38:12] is wanting to show you Sarah that you
[38:15] are part of the promise of God and it
[38:17] isn't just about a prophet isn't about
[38:19] just a preacher it isn't just about
[38:21] somebody else in the church but Sarah
[38:24] you are part of the promise of God he's
[38:26] wanting to bring himself in the form of
[38:28] a dust of a man to come and speak a word
[38:31] that you can see hey I'm part of the
[38:34] promise of God God has spoken this to me
[38:37] a man and he says you know sometimes
[38:39] when you get in a particular time and
[38:41] you're trying to press in and you're
[38:43] trying to pray or you're trying to get
[38:45] something from God Satan brings every
[38:47] kind of sticker or every kind of briar
[38:49] every kind of thought or every kind of
[38:52] thing it gives you what to keep
[38:54] something from happening and brother
[38:56] Branham said you know I mean I remember
[38:57] at the particular time like that he's
[38:59] City I go out and let him out in the
[39:01] wilderness somewhere to pray him he led
[39:03] him to a certain place it was a mill
[39:05] town I've had the privilege of being in
[39:07] that little town and seeing the house
[39:08] that he's speaking of in the church
[39:10] there and the place where it was and all
[39:12] that but he had been brought there
[39:14] because it was a lamb that had been
[39:16] crying it was crying out meal town and
[39:19] he comes to this place and he said that
[39:21] we searching for it and you know in our
[39:23] time that we live in now you can punch
[39:25] it in on your ways or your GPS and put
[39:28] in you know just say for instance cotton
[39:30] Valley and they're saying you've got so
[39:32] many minutes from here and then put out
[39:34] plot out but that wasn't what he had
[39:35] accident mill town was hardly no further
[39:37] than what cotton valley is from us but
[39:39] he didn't know where it was that and he
[39:41] begins to ask and finally somebody was
[39:43] able to point him in the direction and
[39:45] he goes there because he had her seen a
[39:47] vision or a herd of lamb crying out
[39:50] town and it gets there under the unction
[39:52] of and the inspiration of God and he
[39:55] goes out to pray and he says here I was
[39:57] trying to pray for the situation because
[39:59] he was holding a meeting and he was
[40:02] holding revivals and you know and it was
[40:04] a town that was a place under such
[40:06] oppression that they didn't believe in
[40:07] divine healing and they they devil was
[40:10] pushing against him and trying to keep
[40:13] him out of that town but he knew he was
[40:15] under divine orchestration of God to be
[40:18] there and so he goes out into the
[40:20] wilderness and the country that had a
[40:22] praying as he's pray and he says the
[40:24] sticker starts sticking him and the
[40:26] Brier start biting on and mosquitoes
[40:28] start buzzing him you know and he starts
[40:31] swatting at them and he starts thinking
[40:33] about the stickers and he just says Lord
[40:35] I need your help and a sticker poke him
[40:37] lord I need your help and a mosquito
[40:38] bite him he said he didn't know I had to
[40:40] get to the point then I didn't worry no
[40:43] more about a mosquito I didn't worry no
[40:45] more about a sticker I was here to hear
[40:47] from God and I was going to hear from
[40:50] God and I began to pray and I begin to
[40:52] pray harder the more the sticker stuck
[40:54] the harder I pray the more than mosquito
[40:56] bit the harder I prayed he said I didn't
[40:58] care to the mosquito bit he could just
[41:00] fill up if he wanted to I wasn't
[41:02] concerned about him no more I was there
[41:04] for one reason if we can get that
[41:06] singleness of mind tonight the word the
[41:09] heart of the devil pushes the harder I'm
[41:11] going to pray the harder he comes
[41:13] against me the heart I'm going to pray
[41:15] I'm going to get something from God and
[41:17] if you come with that expectation in
[41:19] that at an auction in your heart that
[41:21] I'm not leaving here without hearing
[41:24] from God God will talk to you God will
[41:27] speak to you and as he pushed into that
[41:29] now here God was determined what was he
[41:31] determined he was determined to sent one
[41:33] lamb free and this lamb was caught in a
[41:38] and a tangle of unbelief the church
[41:40] didn't believe mom and daddy didn't
[41:42] believe it was caught in a thicket of
[41:44] unbelief but God was determined he was
[41:47] going to save that lamb I'm thankful to
[41:50] serve a God that's determined like that
[41:52] because I once was lost but now I'm
[41:54] found I once was blind but now I see why
[41:57] because God
[41:58] is so determined to save what is his you
[42:03] know we just had the privilege of
[42:05] watching the the plate Jesus at the
[42:07] sight and sound or a trip and that one
[42:10] thing that really struck me was how they
[42:12] played out the maniac of gaturro and as
[42:15] Jesus went across the sea and he's going
[42:17] and the storms are rocking and rolling
[42:18] and you see the maniac up in the bushes
[42:21] there and he's getting all tore up and
[42:23] the demons of torment are there and but
[42:26] Jesus was so determined and he would
[42:28] leave a crowd and go to one and as he's
[42:31] going across they played it out as Jesus
[42:33] would tell the parable about leaving the
[42:35] ninety-nine and go after that one lost
[42:38] lamb hallelujah I'm glad I serve a card
[42:41] like that that God has determined to
[42:44] meet the month the smallest of needs are
[42:47] the smallest of places got to go through
[42:49] hell to get there he don't care what it
[42:51] takes if that's his lamb he's going
[42:53] after it
[42:55] amen and Jesus steps out of the boat and
[42:57] he begins to walk up out up there and
[42:59] the man has begin to be tormented by the
[43:02] spirits and the voice and he says what's
[43:04] your name and Legion speaks out the
[43:07] demons it was like a voice I never
[43:09] thought about this but you know Legion
[43:11] being many it was many voices that spoke
[43:13] out of this man and Jesus said I'm not
[43:15] speaking to you I'm speaking to this man
[43:20] hallelujah
[43:21] he says Dorian that's what the name that
[43:23] guy I never thought about Legion having
[43:25] a name but God knows your name and the
[43:29] devil might want to give you a different
[43:31] name but God knows your real name Amen
[43:34] in here this little girl the devil to
[43:37] try to put tuberculosis on her and not
[43:39] what she was known by was unbelief in
[43:42] tuberculosis but God knew her name
[43:45] hallelujah and I want to hear you tell
[43:48] you tonight God knows your name he knows
[43:51] exactly the situation you find yourself
[43:53] in he knows exactly the tormenting
[43:56] spirits that's been upon you and he's
[43:58] not going to talk to them he's talking
[44:00] to you tonight and he's saying is there
[44:03] anything too hard for the Lord
[44:05] listen if he can go across the raging
[44:07] sea and save one he can come in the
[44:10] service on a Wednesday night and set the
[44:12] captive free he can come in the service
[44:15] on a Wednesday night and said he'll
[44:17] never sick person among us he's that
[44:19] kind of car is anything too hard for the
[44:22] Lord
[44:24] hey man but here she was a little girl
[44:28] could hardly spit in a cup 35 pounds her
[44:31] legs just about so big he says thinner
[44:34] than Florence Nightingale so I've seen
[44:37] pictures of her there's anything too
[44:40] hard to the Lord for the Lord said he'd
[44:42] been a revival for two weeks coming to
[44:44] the church said it was there said
[44:50] something begin to press go up in the
[44:51] wilderness of praying he said when
[44:53] anything presses like that you do it
[44:56] because it's the Holy Spirit and mrs.
[44:59] Wright said Billy I'll ring the old
[45:01] country dinner bound for you in his
[45:02] times and I ring that when it's suppers
[45:05] ready for you to come then when you come
[45:06] and eat we'll go right to church I said
[45:08] all right he goes out there and he says
[45:10] you know as I got there the rocks
[45:12] started poking me the stickers started
[45:14] poking me the mosquitoes started buzzing
[45:16] he said you know the devil is just
[45:17] trying to keep you from getting the
[45:19] blessing hey man I wonder how many
[45:22] blessings we've been robbed out of in a
[45:24] service because we allowed the voice of
[45:27] Satan or the torment and thing I'm
[45:29] saying to become greater than pressing
[45:31] our way into the kingdom of God and he
[45:33] said what it was the devil's trying to
[45:35] keep you from getting the blessing and I
[45:37] climbed a little further into the
[45:38] thicket and knelt down mosquitos was
[45:40] there and I was like oh God be
[45:42] merciful and I threw up my hands and
[45:45] prayed anyhow
[45:46] and then as I begin to get so burdened
[45:48] in my heart and pray and pray I become
[45:51] so lost in prayer he said I don't hope
[45:53] you Christians know what that means
[45:55] that's praying in the spirit and he said
[45:58] I opened my eyes and it was a little
[46:00] light hanging there and said rise and go
[46:02] by the way of Carters hallelujah is that
[46:06] he walked in there there's this little
[46:08] girl it's laying there seemed impossible
[46:10] for an impossible situation
[46:12] but he said rise in the name of Jesus
[46:15] and you're healed he said I don't even
[46:18] know why I said it it just come out of
[46:20] my mouth before I could even think about
[46:22] rise in the name of Jesus and be healed
[46:25] he said is there anything too hard for
[46:27] the Lord and he said that she rose up
[46:31] out of there and began to march all over
[46:34] the and bless the grass and bless the
[46:36] trees and scream and shout and father
[46:38] came home an unbeliever unbelieving
[46:41] father came heard all the noise began
[46:44] running in then there's this daughter
[46:45] sitting there playing there is a
[46:47] fountain filled with blood drawn from
[46:49] Emmanuel's veins with sinners plunged
[46:51] beneath that flood lose all their guilty
[46:53] sayings he said her name is Georgie
[46:55] Carter CAA rter milk town into Hana ride
[47:00] her if you'd like to know the testimony
[47:02] for yourself Amen I was preaching this
[47:05] about her one time up and up in Ohio and
[47:07] her sister brought me a picture of her
[47:09] sitting there a man on her seat there
[47:11] she was a caretaker in Georgia Carter
[47:13] later years and when I looked at that
[47:15] picture and behind there was a little
[47:17] plaque that said I believe in the power
[47:19] of a Living God Amen why is anything too
[47:23] hard for the Lord
[47:24] well what happened Satan is trying to
[47:26] block you from receiving something from
[47:29] him so it's in little things that gets
[47:31] you in sin things right before service

[47:35] way to church they try to block you from
[47:37] receiving something from God but you got
[47:39] a pushback against those things

[47:42] [Applause]
[47:43] but one way in the middle of our storm
[47:46] we must never forget who he is a storm
[47:52] or struggle or a situation that seems to
[47:55] be complete chaos
[47:56] it's just Satan trying to block us from
[47:58] a promise trying to get us to a place we
[48:01] can't receive something from God and
[48:03] missing altogether sickness comes
[48:05] troubles at the door trials on ever hand

[49:25] there seems to be no way
[49:27] here's a pain taker here's a waymaker he
[49:31] is a promise keeper I'm talking about
[49:33] the god of gods what was it to Abraham
[49:41] and Sarah it was the force of God he
[49:45] meant what was it it was a trumpet that
[49:47] blasted the promises also for you Sarah
[49:51] a man have you ever had the voice of God
[49:56] speak to you I've had to speak to me
[50:01] might have been in the form of some dust
[50:04] but when you heard that voice it might
[50:06] have come out of a friend or out of that
[50:08] may come from heaven I don't know but
[50:11] I've heard that voice hey man you know
[50:17] we think this was beats of all this
[50:18] would be some kind of ha just euphoria
[50:21] of a wonderful meeting no this is three
[50:24] men walking out of the dust just common
[50:27] visitors out on the plains there come
[50:31] walking out of the desert but Abraham
[50:33] saw something a little different about
[50:35] them he heard the voice and he realized
[50:38] hey this is the same one that's been
[50:40] talking to me but Sarah's in a tent
[50:43] there and she's all stood up like yeah
[50:45] well this is really a good day for some
[50:47] company to show up you know and she's
[50:49] all kind of a tore up mood and things
[50:51] and if she wasn't careful she was going
[50:54] to miss it but she was ordained to carry
[50:58] her promised child so the devil could do
[51:01] whatever he want to but he couldn't keep
[51:02] the promise from being fulfilled and God
[51:05] came and spoke and he said Sarah I've
[51:09] had that voice speak to me
[51:11] and he almost leaves you're like ringing
[51:13] in your ears for a moment in the whole
[51:15] world just for a moment just goes quiet
[51:17] and all you can hear is that voice a man
[51:20] that is the voice of God it's a trumpet
[51:22] blasted amen and ever end the one that
[51:25] when the voice of God is a thunder or a
[51:27] trumpet it's a sounding that goes for
[51:30] amen
[51:31] not a whisper it's a blast Satan doing
[51:34] everything he could to block it but that
[51:37] blast going through the doubt and the
[51:39] fear and the unbelief and could it be me
[51:42] Sam
[51:43] you're going to have a child hallelujah
[51:48] amen that same voices here tonight
[51:50] saying Sarah the promise is up to you
[51:54] it's your promise it ain't just somebody
[51:56] else on up you it's your promise stood
[52:03] up eyes on the wrong things but God's
[52:05] words gonna be fulfilled and when the
[52:07] Word of God sounds out in your life it
[52:09] will cause a war and when the trumpet is
[52:13] a sounding for war a man it's the voice
[52:16] of God sounding for war that's what the
[52:19] Jubilee trumpet was in and you know
[52:21] forty-nine years but on the fiftieth
[52:23] year they could go free it was a
[52:26] sounding of the trumpet it was a sound
[52:28] of freedom it was a blast that went
[52:31] across the country and the begin to
[52:33] sound out it as it entered into the
[52:36] years if they don't accept it for what
[52:38] it was they could go free amen if they
[52:42] would hear it with their ears they could
[52:43] throw their hose down they can do
[52:45] anything that the plow another Road they
[52:47] didn't have to live another moment in
[52:49] slavery they didn't have to do not one
[52:50] more thing for that for that slave
[52:52] master they could walk away a free man
[52:55] because it was a blast that took forward
[52:58] a trumpet that sounded and when that
[53:00] trumpet sounded there wasn't anything
[53:03] too hard for the Lord
[53:04] there wasn't no situation too hard for
[53:07] the Lord unless it would be unbelief the
[53:15] sounding of a trumpet the gospel trumpet
[53:17] it means get ready for scriptural war
[53:21] this is in the signs of the answer
[53:24] scripture war Paul said if you want to
[53:27] put this down first Corinthians 48 14:8
[53:30] said if the trumpet gives an uncertain
[53:32] sound
[53:33] how will a man know what to prepare for
[53:35] if it doesn't give a scriptural sound a
[53:38] vindicated sound the Word of God
[53:40] Manifest how we how would we know he
[53:43] said if it says they believe in Jesus
[53:45] Christ the same yesterday today and
[53:47] there forever
[53:48] but then they denies signs and wonders
[53:50] that the whole realm of nature bleed on
[53:53] him and all the churches bleed on by
[53:54] this how would we know how to prepare he
[53:57] said somebody has come forth with a
[53:58] chart and drawed it out out somebody's
[54:00] coming down another thing contrary that
[54:02] and there's so many voices but when God
[54:04] sounds it will be a scriptural war it'll
[54:09] take you back to the scriptures for you
[54:11] to have something to hold on to amen
[54:14] it'll be scripturally right it'll be
[54:16] listen this message is they you know
[54:18] people say what brother branham said
[54:19] this and brother Branham said this this
[54:21] is the message of what the message is is
[54:23] what the Bible says amen him even if
[54:27] brother Branham said it if you don't
[54:29] take it back to the Bible then it's not
[54:31] a scriptural war but listen brother
[54:33] Branham didn't have to come and rewrite
[54:35] another book he brought us back to the
[54:38] Bible and he put us in our homeland and
[54:40] said these are your boundaries and when
[54:43] you see the devil coming in on your
[54:45] boundary prepare for war don't let him
[54:48] stay there I don't know I think we've
[54:52] allowed the devil to encroach on our
[54:54] freedoms for too long and we've allowed
[54:56] him to come into our homes into our
[54:58] houses
[54:59] listen if you'll eat the book it'll
[55:01] prepare you to war with the devil and
[55:03] take back your promises your god-given
[55:07] right you know what your god-given right
[55:15] as a woman is to be a godly woman that's
[55:19] a god-given right you know if you want
[55:22] to paint yourself up and look like a
[55:24] Jezebel that's not a god-given right
[55:26] that's not a scriptural battle a
[55:29] scripture when you bring it back to the
[55:31] scripture to declare war on your closet
[55:35] hey man you boys to it a declare war on
[55:38] your hairstyles and you and your closet
[55:41] and everything that you got going on
[55:43] your phones

[55:49] man that's what this list what this
[55:50] jubilee trumpet is this jubilee trumpet
[55:53] wasn't for you to remain in slavery this
[55:56] message is not slavery this message is
[55:59] freedom it's the greatest freedom to
[56:02] ever hit this world amen
[56:04] it's the greatest sounding that ever hit
[56:06] this world since the death of Jesus
[56:08] Christ this message sounded out of
[56:10] Jubilee Amen to bring us into a
[56:13] scriptural warfare to where we know who
[56:15] we're fighting and what we're fighting
[56:17] for amen this message is not I cast my
[56:21] boundaries and binding this it is our
[56:23] freedom I don't get it I mean people say
[56:33] well I I'm in the battle for the Lord
[56:35] yet they still got paint on their faces
[56:38] they still wearing ungodly things
[56:41] how many started reading that book on
[56:43] the dress brother Tim gave out any man
[56:48] listen it's a scriptural war that's
[56:52] going on listen there he said but when
[56:56] God comes in the power of his
[56:58] resurrection who's going to speak
[57:01] against it when God comes and vindicates
[57:04] a word who's going to speak against they
[57:07] said of Jesus Christ is the same
[57:08] yesterday today and forever then he does
[57:10] the same signs that he did yesterday
[57:12] today and forever that's what this angel
[57:15] is talking about the last angel seven
[57:16] things you're supposed to do take the
[57:18] mysteries and blue sins and that run
[57:20] people out and run people out on if it
[57:23] gives an uncertain sound unscriptural
[57:25] who can prepare himself a trumpet did
[57:28] you notice each one of those ages I told
[57:30] you the church coming in when that
[57:32] trumpet sound of the seer of seal tore
[57:34] loose a trumpet means war it don't if it
[57:37] don't give a scriptural sound that
[57:39] about it but let me call this to you
[57:41] member each church age had his message
[57:43] and his messenger Paul was the first
[57:45] messenger and when that trumpet sounded
[57:48] the first seal tore loose Paul the first
[57:50] message he found what did he do he
[57:52] declared war on that Orthodox Church hey
[57:57] man is anything to the heart for the
[57:59] Lord and when he was having to go down
[58:01] into their dance and give their lives up
[58:03] for this gospel is anything too hard for
[58:05] the Lord but God gave them a power Paul
[58:14] knowing the Scriptures knowing Jesus was
[58:16] the Messiah blasted those synagogues
[58:18] from place to place with scriptures and
[58:21] he put out le he's put out of every one
[58:23] of them till finally he had to shake the
[58:25] dust from his feet and turn to the
[58:27] Gentile what was it it was a sound of a
[58:29] trumpet standing there with the word
[58:32] don't you miss that the word standing
[58:35] with the word the gospel trumpet
[58:38] hallelujah amen if you wanted to really
[58:40] want to win in this battle the only
[58:42] place you're gonna win is standing with
[58:44] the word Hanabi that's the only place of
[58:48] safety in my day might cost them their
[58:51] lives as far as naturally speaking and
[58:53] it was hung there was crucified but yet
[58:55] today they are in victory why because
[59:00] they stood with the world is anything
[59:03] too hard for the Lord go down to
[59:08] Iranians the next Church age st. Martin
[59:10] the next one Saint Martin blasted his
[59:13] aides Luther's blast of the church's
[59:15] classic Church with the word of God the
[59:18] just shall live by faith and this is not
[59:21] the literal body of Christ and he
[59:23] through the communion on the floor and
[59:24] walked out and blessed in that Catholic
[59:26] Church what was it it was a trumpet that
[59:29] was sounding that everyone could go free
[59:33] hallelujah and it was many that walked
[59:36] out of them catechisms and in dark
[59:38] places of Catholicism
[59:40] free man the just shall live by faith
[59:44] why because there's anything too hard
[59:46] for the Lord God will have victorious
[59:49] lives in every age or therefore he would
[59:53] not have spoken to him that overcometh
[59:56] and every age he said to him that
[59:58] overcometh he couldn't put that in there
[1:00:00] unless there was an overcomer to me had
[1:00:04] he spoken in palsies he spoken in i
[1:00:07] radiuses and he said a trumpet a voice
[1:00:10] of God it was to prepare them for
[1:00:12] scriptural battles and scriptures Lord
[1:00:15] to fight an army and the enemy that was
[1:00:19] going to try to press and press and
[1:00:21] press but God sent something to combat
[1:00:24] him with hey man we can see the pail the
[1:00:28] horse riders as they took forth a man a
[1:00:30] man with all the the white horse and the
[1:00:33] black horse or the red horse of black
[1:00:34] horse all the way down to the pail and
[1:00:36] it's beginning to ride not in this full
[1:00:38] force until thankfully we're out of here
[1:00:40] but in every one of them God sent an
[1:00:43] antidote or he said a warring ain't
[1:00:47] meant an opposition to uh to come in
[1:00:49] opposition listen we're not in this
[1:00:50] battle alone hallelujah I want you to
[1:00:54] understand you're not standing or

[1:01:15] the Eagle he's calling to battle John
[1:01:22] Wesley raised up said why they said why

[1:01:33] that Anglican Church with the gospel

[1:01:48] their iniquity he said if they had been
[1:01:51] the trend all the way down to the age
[1:01:52] where God changed his trend today no he
[1:01:55] can't do it

[1:12:40] medicines and things and was causing her

[1:12:59] going to fight you can't lay around and
[1:13:02] your wowsie wowsie was you can't lay
[1:13:04] around depressed you've got to start
[1:13:06] speaking the word I said let me ask you
[1:13:10] something
[1:13:10] I said how long would you lay there in
[1:13:13] bed if there was a man walked in this
[1:13:15] house and started dragging your little
[1:13:17] granddaughter out the door no no honey I
[1:13:20] know I know what you do you'd grab
[1:13:22] whatever you can grab and you start
[1:13:24] beating with everything you got a beat
[1:13:26] and I said you're gonna have to do the
[1:13:28] same thing to that spirit that's coming
[1:13:30] against your mind say this thing where
[1:13:31] I'm not entertaining you you get out of
[1:13:33] here I said I can't do it for your dad
[1:13:36] can't do it for you got to do it for
[1:13:38] yourself
[1:13:39] you guys I am not entertaining you know
[1:13:41] more let's something rise up on the
[1:13:43] inside of her and all of a sudden it
[1:13:45] came over her and she began to scream
[1:13:47] out I ain't gonna listen to you one more
[1:13:49] time devil I ain't gonna listen to hear
[1:13:52] no more I'm walking I won't be a free
[1:13:54] woman
[1:13:56] and listen that's something that you got
[1:13:59] to do in the service you didn't tell the
[1:14:01] devil I'm not listening to you and this
[1:14:03] is my service this is my time Healing is
[1:14:06] out the door
[1:14:07] I wonder how many times he comes our
[1:14:13] door and he knocks and he said whosoever
[1:14:15] will let him open up you have something
[1:14:19] to do well Brandon would talk about this
[1:14:25] in the contest he said our contest is
[1:14:29] not a physical contest as a spiritual
[1:14:32] contest spiritual wickedness in high
[1:14:33] places and he reads it there out of
[1:14:36] Ephesians and we spent some time on that
[1:14:37] a while back on the fees and six when we
[1:14:40] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:14:41] against principalities against powers
[1:14:44] against rulers of the darkness of this
[1:14:46] world against spiritual wickedness in
[1:14:48] high places and I thought it was very
[1:14:50] interesting how he started that sermon
[1:14:52] out he said spiritual wickedness in high
[1:14:54] places
[1:14:55] she said I'd like to speak to you on a
[1:14:56] contest and he said a contest is a test
[1:15:01] of strength he said we have to tell and
[1:15:04] we are here to test strength and he said
[1:15:07] the Indians used to build a fire and it
[1:15:09] puts so many men on one end of a rope
[1:15:11] and so many men on the other end it'd be
[1:15:13] a tug of war it was a contest of
[1:15:16] strength who will pull the losing party
[1:15:18] across the fire he said now we know
[1:15:22] there's many things he said we could
[1:15:24] talk about he said would be said about a
[1:15:26] contest he said but this contest I want
[1:15:28] to talk about is between the church and
[1:15:30] Satan now notice he didn't say Jesus and
[1:15:34] say he said the church and Satan the
[1:15:36] great strength of the church and they
[1:15:39] don't want to speak about the great
[1:15:40] strength of God or the great seats of
[1:15:42] the great strength of Satan and then we
[1:15:44] want to speak about the great strength
[1:15:46] of God in his church
[1:15:49] so you're not fighting this battle alone
[1:15:51] I want you to understand you're not the
[1:15:54] only one that's got a hold of the road
[1:15:57] is there anything too hard for the Lord
[1:16:00] but he's gonna let you pull it around
[1:16:02] wrestle it out and you're gonna wrestle
[1:16:04] with it as Jacob wrestled with it as
[1:16:06] many have wrestled down to the ages were
[1:16:09] saying he said we know but we know when
[1:16:11] Satan is trying now to pull God's people
[1:16:14] across the fire we know who has the most
[1:16:17] power God does and God when He gave the
[1:16:22] people the best thing he could combat
[1:16:24] Satan with his word and the Word of God
[1:16:26] who is stronger than God is anything too
[1:16:30] hard for the Lord the Word of God and
[1:16:33] the word becomes our strength God in the
[1:16:36] church it becomes a straight to pull
[1:16:38] Satan into his own fire hallelujah
[1:16:44] even every service you come to you have
[1:16:47] the obligation to grab ahold of the Rope
[1:16:50] so I'm going to pull with everything
[1:16:52] I've got
[1:16:53] because it's me are you devil hey man he
[1:16:57] said he said those saying he says people
[1:16:59] says he said people don't believe in
[1:17:01] demons in this day some of the thing to
[1:17:03] do is to know your enemy to train to
[1:17:06] know exactly where the punch is going to
[1:17:08] come from and how to punch him he says
[1:17:10] he tries to study us and he's been
[1:17:12] studying for 6,000 years he studies his
[1:17:14] legs licks he knows what he's fighting
[1:17:16] for whether he leans forward hangs back
[1:17:19] checks and if his left hand or right
[1:17:20] hand he studies all of that he tries to
[1:17:23] find him a sparring partner the fight
[1:17:24] just like it was a bonus fight he said
[1:17:26] the thing that's very good for
[1:17:27] Christians to do is to know where you
[1:17:30] want to start training and he start with
[1:17:33] John 3:16 for God so loved the world you
[1:17:38] need to tell that devil and that God
[1:17:39] loves me won't you to turn around to
[1:17:46] your neighbor and tell your neighbor God
[1:17:47] loves me and God loves you hey man that
[1:17:51] right there wouldn't already start the
[1:17:53] licks and on Satan because Satan always
[1:17:55] wanting to come to you and said nobody
[1:17:56] cares nobody understands nobody knows
[1:18:00] nobody's worried about you you're on
[1:18:02] your own nobody care just you're by
[1:18:05] yourself God so loved the world God
[1:18:14] makes us he says God could think of what
[1:18:16] he could give for his people to defeat
[1:18:18] the enemy if he could thought of
[1:18:20] anything better he would have done it
[1:18:21] but he gave to the people his word said
[1:18:24] now the enemy is gonna study he's gonna
[1:18:27] try to find it find that wheat pump
[1:18:29] moment like he did Eve and once he it's
[1:18:32] the word it's the word the line is the
[1:18:34] word and Satan's on the other end trying
[1:18:37] to pull you with the word that's what he
[1:18:40] did he pulled her out of Eden with the
[1:18:42] word he come and he tried to pull with
[1:18:45] the deceit he tried to do it to Jesus he
[1:18:49] used the word against Jesus to try to
[1:18:52] pull them out of their position looks so
[1:18:54] good look so in it looks so right but it
[1:18:57] wasn't scriptural you always got to take
[1:19:00] him back to the word and you'll realize
[1:19:04] when you take him back to the word he
[1:19:06] left something out it's 99% the truth
[1:19:10] but that's he said wouldn't it but he
[1:19:12] said what happens he tries to bring the
[1:19:14] word and reason it yet God has said you
[1:19:18] are but not for this time yeah you can
[1:19:22] be healed but not this service and every
[1:19:25] time he's pulling you closer to the fire
[1:19:27] you you're you're one of his but it's
[1:19:31] gonna not just wait a little longer it's
[1:19:33] not right now and he's pulling trying to
[1:19:36] pull you to destruction he said well
[1:19:38] what is it it's a contest and what you
[1:19:40] have to do is get away from all unbelief
[1:19:43] all doubts and get back to John 3:16 God
[1:19:47] so loved the world he loves me he said
[1:19:54] see Satan didn't to disagree with her
[1:19:56] when she quoted the word God said you
[1:19:59] gonna eat there of that day you eat
[1:20:00] there they waiting he didn't disagree he
[1:20:02] said certainly that's right but you see
[1:20:04] you need some new light need something a
[1:20:06] little different from what God said if
[1:20:08] you do you'll be a little smarter what
[1:20:10] was he doing pulling there
[1:20:11] ever so closely to himself he said this
[1:20:13] even seeing but God said you would you
[1:20:17] would die that settles it that broke
[1:20:19] that great tug-of-war broke loose the
[1:20:21] whole human race to death because Eve
[1:20:24] listened to the reason of against God's
[1:20:27] Word and he said every time you do it
[1:20:29] it'll pull you into the fire he said so
[1:20:33] you know men he said today there's no
[1:20:35] such a thing as a devil that that was
[1:20:37] just a bad thought now we're at this
[1:20:38] church know better than that he's more
[1:20:41] than just a bad thought but so is God
[1:20:42] more than just a good thought Honolulu
[1:20:45] yeah we didn't the Bible says but the
[1:20:48] Holy Spirit he the Holy Spirit has come
[1:20:49] he personal program he's something real
[1:20:52] and the devil is a person demons are a
[1:20:54] person he said a man was arguing me a
[1:20:56] few weeks ago you know what I did do you
[1:20:58] just be just put something in people's
[1:21:00] mind thinking that you're telling them a
[1:21:01] thing and it just changes of the thought
[1:21:03] he said I met the very same thing in
[1:21:05] India one time those holy men that were
[1:21:08] there and I believe the largest hearted
[1:21:09] to ever stood before me half a million
[1:21:12] people caught it by discernment of the
[1:21:14] spirit of why this man was blind he said
[1:21:16] this big force he said this tug of war
[1:21:19] was going on he's just reading their
[1:21:21] minds but he said I knew I wasn't
[1:21:24] reading his mind he said knew I'd seen a
[1:21:26] vision and the vision had told me why
[1:21:29] this man was blind brother Branham puts
[1:21:32] out the challenge he said hey you ready
[1:21:35] you wise men a holy man you think that
[1:21:39] like that said this man became blind
[1:21:41] because he was looking at the Sun and
[1:21:43] worshiping the Sun he said now if you by
[1:21:45] the power that you believe in you come
[1:21:47] in healing and he said that not up one
[1:21:50] of them came up he said but what was
[1:21:53] going on it was a tug of war
[1:21:55] there's a tug award in every service
[1:21:59] will I get anything this service will I
[1:22:03] received something from God am I gonna
[1:22:06] get something and Satan's like no not
[1:22:08] this time
[1:22:09] just wait a little longer yeah you are
[1:22:13] child of God just wait a little longer
[1:22:15] yeah you're you're you're an overcomer
[1:22:17] just wait a little longer and he said as
[1:22:22] he stood there
[1:22:27] you know some people today when they
[1:22:29] bring this down some people today are
[1:22:31] trying to say that Jesus ain't the word
[1:22:33] we're supposed to use we're supposed to
[1:22:35] use Yahweh or Yeshua it's a bunch of
[1:22:39] nonsense I'd rather use the word that
[1:22:42] was vindicated in this hour Jesus I'd
[1:22:51] rather use the name that the word the
[1:22:53] word the name that the squirrels were
[1:22:55] created in the name that blind eyes see
[1:22:59] the name that healed the Deaf and healed
[1:23:02] the lepers and raised the dead that's
[1:23:04] the name I'm going to use hey man I'm
[1:23:07] not gonna follow some other thing that's
[1:23:09] that ain't even been de cated but I know
[1:23:12] that names vindicated and that's what he
[1:23:15] did he said I come here not in my own
[1:23:18] name he said but I come in the name of
[1:23:20] the Lord Jesus Christ and he said by
[1:23:23] that power and he said what is it it's
[1:23:26] actually a power God is God Satan is God
[1:23:28] if you don't believe in the devil just
[1:23:29] wait a little bit he said don't tell me
[1:23:31] there's no devil because I know better I
[1:23:32] fight him every day and he fights him
[1:23:34] every day so I know there's a devil
[1:23:36] he said he must be trained when you meet
[1:23:38] him not trained with psychology or
[1:23:40] trained with education but trained by
[1:23:42] the Holy Spirit God's power in his word
[1:23:44] to make it manifest know your enemy but
[1:23:47] as I stood there I said it's got to
[1:23:50] happen because Jesus said it's going to
[1:23:52] happen so I stood there beyond the
[1:23:55] reasoning beyond the mind battles beyond
[1:23:57] the tug-of-war and I grabbed the line
[1:23:59] and I said in the name of Jesus let this
[1:24:02] man receiveth saying and that pull
[1:24:06] pulled that man into his healing let's
[1:24:14] go to Ezekiel 36 is anything too hard
[1:24:19] for the Lord
[1:24:28] I'm just reading this and just so struck
[1:24:31] me said also thou son of man prophesy
[1:24:35] into the mountains of Israel and say
[1:24:38] mountains of Israel hear the word of the
[1:24:41] Lord thus saith the Lord God because the
[1:24:44] enemy has said against you AHA even the
[1:24:49] high ancient high places are ours in
[1:24:51] position therefore prophesy and say thus
[1:24:55] saith the Lord God now notice what he's
[1:24:56] talking to his tongue to the hills the
[1:24:58] mountains the valleys the promised land
[1:25:00] the promises and the enemy had garish
[1:25:03] them their self around the promises and
[1:25:05] said we're gonna take these high places
[1:25:07] they belong to us but a word came to him
[1:25:10] said thus saith the Lord because they
[1:25:12] made you desolate and swallowed you up
[1:25:14] on every side that you might be a
[1:25:15] possession unto the residue of the
[1:25:17] healing heathen and you've taken up the
[1:25:19] lips and you're taking up in the lips of
[1:25:21] the talkers and are an infamy of the
[1:25:23] people therefore your mountains of
[1:25:25] Israel hear the word of the Lord thus
[1:25:28] saith the Lord God to the mountains to
[1:25:30] the hills to the rivers to the valleys
[1:25:33] to the desolate wasters to the cities
[1:25:35] that are forsaken which become a prey
[1:25:37] and arisen to the residue of the healing
[1:25:39] that heathen that are roundabout
[1:25:40] therefore thus saith the Lord God surely
[1:25:43] in the fire my jealousy have I spoken
[1:25:46] against the residue of the heathen and
[1:25:47] it gets all into me and whichever poured
[1:25:50] in my land into the possession with a
[1:25:52] joy of all the heart with the spiteful
[1:25:54] minds to cast it out for a pray prophesy
[1:25:56] therefore concerning the land of Israel
[1:25:58] and say to the mountains to the hills to
[1:26:01] the rivers to the valleys thus saith the
[1:26:03] Lord behold I'm spoken to my jealousy
[1:26:06] and in my fury because I'll born the
[1:26:08] shame of the healing dust saith the LORD
[1:26:10] of how many times he said I'm speaking
[1:26:13] here I've lifted up my hands surely they
[1:26:16] even that are about you they shall bear
[1:26:18] their shame but ye o mountains of Israel
[1:26:21] ye promises you words of God you shall
[1:26:25] shoot forth your branches and yield your
[1:26:28] fruit to my people
[1:26:31] to my people of Israel for they are at
[1:26:34] hand to come Oh hallelujah
[1:26:36] you didn't tell your prayer promise I'm
[1:26:38] at hand I'm at hand I'm here to receive

[1:26:45] Lord it may look like that promises went

[1:26:58] do what I have said you're gonna do for
[1:27:00] who you're gonna do it for for I have
[1:27:03] spoken saith the Lord for behold I am

[1:27:25] of Israel even all of it in the city
[1:27:28] shall be inhabited and the way shall be
[1:27:30] builded and I won't multiply upon you
[1:27:32] men and beasts and they shall increase
[1:27:34] and bring forth fruit and I will settle

[1:27:39] better unto you than at your beginnings
[1:27:41] come on job better at you then what
[1:27:44] happens at your beginnings hey brothers
[1:27:46] brother Danny said before we left quit
[1:27:48] looking at what's going on in the middle
[1:27:50] and look to the end the promises of God
[1:27:52] and realized God's gonna do better for
[1:27:54] me daddy did at the beginning he's gonna
[1:27:57] give me streets of gold to walk on he's
[1:28:00] gonna give me a body that's never sinned
[1:28:02] and no doubts no worries no fears no
[1:28:04] ever he's gonna give me more than I ever
[1:28:06] had thus saith the Lord God I will cause
[1:28:13] men and I you shall know that i am the
[1:28:16] lord verse 12 then I will cause men to

[1:28:22] promises he's been laying there for us
[1:28:24] to walk on even my people Israel they
[1:28:27] shall possess thee and thou shalt be
[1:28:29] their inheritance thou shalt no more
[1:28:32] henceforth burry them of men thus saith
[1:28:35] the LORD because they say unto you now
[1:28:38] land the divine sup men and has breathed
[1:28:40] that nation therefore they shout to our
[1:28:43] men know
[1:28:44] or need to believe that nations anymore
[1:28:46] sent the Lord God neither when I calls
[1:28:48] me into hearing the the shame of the
[1:28:49] heathen anymore neither shalt thou bear
[1:28:52] the reproach of the people anymore
[1:28:53] neither shalt thou cause I nation to
[1:28:55] fall anymore
[1:28:56] saith the Lord God moreover the word of
[1:28:59] the Lord came to me saying son of man
[1:29:01] when the house of Israel dwelt in their
[1:29:03] land they defiled it by their own way
[1:29:05] and by their doings their way was before
[1:29:07] me as uncleanness of a removed woman
[1:29:09] wherefore I poured my fury upon them for
[1:29:12] the blood which had shed upon the land
[1:29:13] and for the idols wherewith they had
[1:29:15] polluted it and I scattered them among
[1:29:17] the heathen they were dispersed through
[1:29:18] the countries according their way
[1:29:20] according to their doings I judge them
[1:29:22] and when they entered to the heathen
[1:29:24] whether they went they profaned my holy
[1:29:25] name and said these are the people the
[1:29:27] Lord are going out of the land but I had
[1:29:29] pity for my Holy Name which the house of
[1:29:32] Israel had profaned among the heathen
[1:29:33] whether they win therefore saying to the
[1:29:35] house of Israel thus saith the Lord I do
[1:29:38] not this for your sake so house of
[1:29:40] Israel but for my holy name sakes which
[1:29:42] you have profaned among the heathens
[1:29:45] whether they win I will sanctify my
[1:29:47] great name I wish you profaned among the
[1:29:50] heathen you profaned in the midst of
[1:29:51] them and he that shall know that I am
[1:29:54] the Lord said the Lord God when I shall
[1:29:56] sanctify in you before their eyes yes
[1:30:01] you went out yes you did wrong but I'm
[1:30:04] gonna bring you home again I'm gonna
[1:30:06] sanctify you right before the heathens
[1:30:09] eyes I've gotta change your body right
[1:30:12] before the heathens eyes and I will take
[1:30:19] you from among the heathen and gather
[1:30:21] out of all the countries or bring you
[1:30:23] into your own land
[1:30:24] then will I sprinkle clean water upon
[1:30:27] you and you shall be clean and from all
[1:30:30] your filthiness and from all your idols
[1:30:32] will I cleanse you can somebody say
[1:30:34] Amazing Grace a new heart also would I
[1:30:37] give you a new spirit where I put within
[1:30:39] you and I'll take away the stony heart
[1:30:42] is anything too hard for the Lord a
[1:30:44] stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[1:30:46] give you a heart of flesh and I'll put
[1:30:48] my spirit within you and cause you to
[1:30:50] walk in my statutes and you shall keep
[1:30:52] my judgments and do them and you should
[1:30:54] dwell in the land that I gave your
[1:30:56] father's and you shall be my people and
[1:30:58] I will be your God and I will save you
[1:31:01] from all your own cleanliness and I will
[1:31:03] call for the corn and will increase it
[1:31:06] and let no famine upon you I will
[1:31:08] multiply the fruit of the tree increase
[1:31:10] of the field and you shall receive no
[1:31:12] more reproach of famine among the
[1:31:14] heathen then you shall remember your own
[1:31:16] evil ways and your doings that were not
[1:31:18] good and shall loathe yourself in your
[1:31:20] own sight for your iniquities and for
[1:31:21] your abominations not for your sakes do
[1:31:24] I do this saith the Lord be it known
[1:31:26] unto you be ashamed and compounded for
[1:31:28] your own ways o house of Israel thus
[1:31:30] says the Lord in the day that I shall
[1:31:31] cleanse you from all your iniquity I
[1:31:34] will also cause you to dwell in cities
[1:31:36] and wasted places shall be built up and
[1:31:39] desolate land shall be tilled and laid
[1:31:42] desolate in the sight of all the paths
[1:31:44] and they shall say this land that was
[1:31:46] desolate it's become like a Garden of
[1:31:49] Eden
[1:31:51] these promises that have laid dormant
[1:31:54] are now blossoming blossom ahead people
[1:31:57] are eating the fruit of them they lay
[1:32:00] dormant for thousands of years the Holy
[1:32:02] Ghost lay the promise of that power to
[1:32:05] give somebody the overcoming power lay
[1:32:08] dormant for so many years but one day a
[1:32:11] trumpet sounds voice spoke and it caused
[1:32:16] the scriptural war and man that had left
[1:32:20] and become as desolate wasteland barren
