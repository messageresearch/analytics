and honor that he's worthy amen just want to report that uh we had a wonderful time at twt Youth Camp there in Ohio and and uh the the services were tremendous the spirit of God moved in a mighty way I believe that the young people and not just the young people that a lot of us were touched greatly in his presence I do want to say that you have a group of young people here that you can be proud of you have a wonderful group and they're they're easy to travel with as easy as it can be to ride a bus for 15 hours however easy that can be well they make it easy um I think that trip gets a little harder on me each and every year but uh it's okay it's worth it to see God move in people's lives amen we we have different ones that that take the bus I know brother Matthew and sister Elizabeth have been every single time so they are to be commended for that for that sacrifice and and you know as it typically typically is these days when we go to camps a lot of people come back with the camp crud with different kind of uh sicknesses I myself have have been under the weather but by God's grace we're here tonight and if you'll just get with me and and help us alone and I believe the Lord will come down and meet with us tonight amen amen let's pray before we read the word Heavenly Father Lord how grateful we are Lord to have this opportunity to stand in your presence Lord Lord right now just remember Lord those that are struggling with sickness in their body Lord those that just weren't able to make it tonight I just pray you'll touch them Lord and those that have have made the effort and pushed through and gathered with us tonight I pray that you'll touch their bodies as well and just Lord touch each one of us in spirit Lord Lift us up to a higher Place father that we can see you more clearly Lord in in this hour of Darkness Lord we commit ourselves to you Lord I Lord I I I know you gave me this thought and I just pray that you'll just help me Lord as cloudy as my mind is Lord to just step aside and allow you to speak father and Lord may it come across clearly to the people tonight what you've laid on My Heart Lord but I know that'll take you to do that Lord so we just committed into your hands now and ask you to speak tonight father bless your word as we read it in Jesus name we pray amen amen if if you have your Bibles we'd like to turn to the Book of Revelation chapter 10 the seventh verse and we're just going to read one verse there and and let you have your seats amen ain't God good to us amen he sure is revelation 10 and verse 7 it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets amen I pray the Lord will add a blessing to the reading of the word as you take your seats tonight amen wonderful you know I I read here in this spot because I I believe that that the voice of the seventh angel that we read about there in Revelation has sounded and and I believe that it that it was the end time message and you know if you just if you just take a moment and look around at the condition of of the world that we're living in and and then you compare it to the scriptures I believe that it'll declare to you that we are living in the end times amen and and and I believe that this message that came in this day was a finishing message I believe it finished the restoration of the word it it it finished the Mysteries as it said there and it anointed a people to finish fin the final lapse of time you know there's been others that have run down down through the years and the ages but it comes our turn now to run the final lapse of time and and as we look into the word tonight The Cry of my heart is that it's time for a greater commitment it's time for a greater sincerity and and a deeper commitment to the things of God it's it's time for total commitment it's time for us as a people to be Allin because you know as we look around Satan has had 6,000 years to to turn this world into a world of evil he's had 6,000 years to mold it and brother brandham would say that God's Eden was established in righteousness he said but Satan's Eden is established in sin so I I I I don't think it takes a great Revelation to look around and see that that statement is the truth that we're living in a world that is totally established on sin man's mind is on evil continually there's there's sin and all levels of government there's there's sin and Corruption and and everything that goes on around us each and every day it's a it's a scientific Eden that denies the very existence of God it's an Eden that feeds from and it worships from the Tree of knowledge that in this day has reached its height that has reached its total maturity and and in this environment you must be totally committed to what you believe you must be fully sold out to what you believe because the the currents of the age are so strong that if you're not anchored if you're not totally committed then it's impossible for you to not be swept away you have to be sold out because if you're halfway in you're eventually going to be all the way out that that goes for just about anything you do in life but especially in our Christian walk if if you're only halfway in it won't be long until you're all the way out because there in Revelation as we read you've read it before where it described as a a smoke that comes up from the bottomless pit and we've talked about it before but smoke has a way of getting into everything smoke has has a way of of tainting everything of getting into every place that isn't sealed so tonight if there's parts of you that isn't sealed if there's parts of you that's uncovered or exposed the the smoke of the age the the currents of the age the thinking of the day it's going to get into those parts of your life you've got to make sure that every bit of it is sealed and every bit of it is committed to the Lord and and what's happened is is this smoke has got into people's minds and it's got into the thinking of humanity where people can't think clearly anymore that people's minds are completely and totally insane it doesn't take long in a conversation or it it doesn't take long listening to the news or or reading some politics or just look at some of the headlines that you see each and every day the things that our politicians stand up and say the things that they do the causes that they choose to fight for and the way people view different situations and we look at it and we say these people are nuts this world has lost its mind this world is gone totally insane and yet as we look at it and we're so quick to judge it and yet if it wasn't for the grace of God if it wasn't for the influence of God if it wasn't for the hand of God's on our lives then we could have lost the ability to think clearly as well we wouldn't be any different from the rest of the world if it wasn't for his influence on our minds giving us Clarity giving us truth and allowing us to stay free from that amen because it's permeated everything in our in our society I just saw a headline yesterday about about Delta Airlines you know it's a a a company established right here in Louisiana you know in the South where sometimes you tend to think maybe they still have values and what it says they will no longer say ladies and gentlemen when they get on a flight they're no longer going to say that because it's not right to gender people that way the whole world has gone completely insane and and you pay attention and watch when people fall away from the faith and and people leave the the the church and watch how their thinking begins to change the further they get away from the the influence of the word when they get out from underneath the influence of Godly Parents or out from underneath the influence of of a of a Godly church and and and soon they'll begin to view sin in a different way and they'll be even begin to support sin unashamedly and and you sit there and you say well well brother Aaron I would never do that and that's because you haven't given over to that mind that's because you have the mind of Christ that's because you're under the influence of the Holy ghost and because of that you can thank God tonight that I still have my sanity I can still look at things and not look at it in a totally crazy way and not recognize they don't even recognize they've been given over to a repeate mind and I'm telling you it's a time that you got to be sold out to truth you can't compromise even a little bit you can't let that smoke come and get into the cracks of your mind into the cracks of your thinking you got to make sure it's sealed up tonight I say once again this is a time that you must be totally sold out and committed to Christ and in Daniel 1 and8 we know that Daniel had been carried away in the Exile and it says in Daniel 1 and8 but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might not defile himself now Daniel found himself kind of in a similar situation to what we find ourselves in he found himself in a pagan country and he found himself surrounded by Evil by Traditions that were against his Traditions by ways of thinking that were contrary to the way he was taught to think and by a culture that hated him in everything that he stood for there was a power there that wanted to break him and mold him into their image and make no mistake about it not not just young people but old people alike That's what Satan wants to do in this day he's molding people into His Image he's molding people into his eeden to place in his eating that fit in his eating but I'm proud today to say I don't fit in in Satan's eating I refuse to be molded by Satan's thinking I I refuse to be molded I want to stand out in this day I want to be committed to God in this day and Daniel is someone that we can all relate to because we find ourselves today in a foreign land pilgrims and strangers where Society is against everything you stand for society is against everything that you believe in and there's a banquet of ungodliness that's set out before you each and every day and you're told to eat this is what we feed on here this is what we feed on here eat this this is what you're going to eat and Daniel purpose in his heart I'm not going to feed on that I'm not going to eat from that table he said it it doesn't matter how different I am it doesn't matter what trial that I am it doesn't matter how much power is offered to me I will not let the influence of the world come in and sway the way I think sway the way that I live I'm not going to feed on their junk I'm not going to eat from that table I'm not going to feed on their ideas Daniel desired a different diet amen believe there's a people here tonight that desires a different diet than what's being laid out on the tables of the world today Daniel desired a different diet you know Daniel didn't say well I can have a little bit of this and I can have a little bit of that as as long as it's in moderation no Daniel said I will not defile myself I will not partake of this in any way and you know those around him that were supposed to be molding Daniel to to serve that Kingdom said but but but you're going to starve you you've got to eat this you've got to eat this what's wrong with this food it's Pleasant to the eyes it tastes good everybody else has eaten it everybody else is feeding on this and you need to experience these things you need to be well rounded young people you need to see what it's like in the real world your kids the're they're going to be weird if you don't let them taste a little bit well listen I I I if being weird means they're different from what I'm seeing out there then I'll sign my kids up for being weird if it means they're going to be different from the purple hairs with 47 Pearsons and 27 Relationships by the time they get married and marriage after marriage and divorce and this and that not knowing what gender they are sign me up tonight for being weird that's where I want to sign the line tonight I'll just be weird but he says you got to eat some of this but I say like Daniel said compare us to all those that are eating from this king's table compare us tonight from those that that are that are eating that diet take a look at our young people take a look at our homes take a look at our lives and compare and they say well how can this be why why they came to Daniel and said how can this be he said because I'm eating a different King's diet my king listen we're eating a different diet from the world well how are your homes like this and how are your young people like this and how do they serve God because they're eating from a different King's diet tonight they're not feeding from the junk of the world so they come out different and we thank God for that difference amen and God honored Daniel and Shadrach Meshach and he honored them for their commit to not defile themselves and I say once again to you tonight it's time for a commitment it's time for us to purpose in our hearts because God has brought a people right up to to the crossing over right up to the wrapping up of all things and in order for us to finish we must be committed that's what I'm speaking to you tonight on is committed to finish committed to finish because as we said others have run their race and and and they've brought it right up to this point but somebody's got to bring it home somebody has to run the final laps and God has tasked us God has given us the honor and he has tasked us with being the Overcomers of Satan's Eden of running the race in the middle of all the doubt of running the race in spite of all the fears of of running the race despite of the ridicule and despite of the mocking of running the race when you're hurting too bad to go on of running the race whenever you want to quit running the race when it feels like you're the only one still running he said you're the ones I picked to run this race you're the ones that's going to take the final lap you know I I just this week I saw an interview with this great athlete and and and he said what separates people that are gifted he said you have one category of athletes he said they're all gifted he said what separates those from good ones and great ones he said is the great ones train when they don't want to he said they get out of bed when they don't want to they eat right when they don't want to they go the extra mile when they don't want to and I heard that and I said the Overcomer keeps going when they don't feel like it the Overcomer keeps going when they don't understand the Overcomer keeps going when they've been offended in the church they they keep going when they've been hurt they keep going whenever others quit that's who we are we're going to keep going no matter how many Falls away we're to keep going when we don't understand what's going on around us we can't quit because we're committed to finish the race and that's exactly what it's going to take is commitment and it's a shame to say but this is an age that knows very little about commitment it's an age what to put it quite bluntly we're living in the age of quitters when something isn't easy they quit when something doesn't cater to them they quit if marriage is difficult they quit Church upset you quit people have offended us quit path gets hard so we quit but we got to get to the place where there's no quit left in us we got to get to the place where there's no quit left in us because you are going to be presented with opportunities to quit you are going to be presented with easier paths and easier ways and this way it would be easier on you and this way seems like it' be easier on the family and this way it be an easier career and and this way looks easier and that way looks easier and I'm going to tell you don't take the easier path don't take the way that looks easier to your flesh but be somebody says I can't quit I won't quit I'm committed to this message I'm committed to God I'm committed to finishing I'm committed to see this thing through don't take the easy way what was brother brandham told he says because thou H has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou H has walked of your own choosing thou Hast picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way what are we saying tonight we got to sell out and commit to his way not to our way or not to the easy way but to his way Psalms 37 and5 says commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light in thy judgment as the noon day brother brandham uses this scripture and him and he deals with it with with committing your way unto the Lord and what he says is that God can't move for you in any situation until you let go of it until you completely committed to God you want an overcoming life you want a Victorious life but you're still holding on to your wants and to your desires and the things that make you happy and the things that bring pleasure to you it doesn't work that way that's not how it works it's going to be the harder way it's going to be the more difficult that way you've got to commit everything to him and as human beings we don't like to give up control you know some people they just they can't not try to fix everything they just have to try to fix it no matter how many times they mess it up I'm gonna fix it this time and they have to learn to let go we have to learn to commit we have to learn to get out of the way and say God I'm just going to pray about it and put it in your hands and quit trying to do everything that I think's going to work brother Brown says we're always wanting God to run errands for us or do something for us but when we're willing to say thy will be done commit ourselves to him commit our ways to him all that we are commit it to him that's when God will move when you're willing to let him work on you and not you work on himo not you work on him but God why didn't you do it God I thought God it would have been so much better if L see we're trying to work on God but he says when you're willing to let God work on you and you know it seems like in life we commit to so many things other than the things of God and I believe in being committed in all things I I I spoke to the youth there at the Ohio camp 21 and older about being committed in all things and no matter what you do I think you should be committed in it if you're a friend be a committed friend if you go to church at evening like Tabernacle be committed if you're a husband be committed if you're a wife be committed if you're working somewhere be committed be committed in all things and I believe that I believe we should be committed at work I believe you should be committed at school I started to say people but can't be a hypocrite I've been a sports fan people are totally committed to a certain team and you know what that team will let you down Time After Time After Time After Time and you'll still be committed to them think about it McDonald's will get your order wrong a thousand times but you'll still go back but let something go wrong one time at church and you're done think about it can we get our church commitment to the level of our McDonald's commitment to where we can at least give people more opportunities and forgive people and we forgive them for messing up our drink order all the time that to be a small thing in McDonald's sometimes it ain't even the right order but it's okay we eat it again and again why be committed and here's the thing back to what I was saying I believe in being committed in all things I I I believe in that but the level of commitment to other things many time exceeds our commitment to the things of God we'll give other things chance after chance we'll give other people chance after chance we'll give jobs chance after chance but let us get burned one time at church or burned two times or burned three times whatever it may be what is your level of commitment to the things of God and to the word of God and to the house of god let's let that surpass our level of commitment to other things and so what I'm asking us to do tonight is check our level of commitment and I want us to go beyond church I'm not talking about right now committed to El I'm talking about your commitment to God your commitment to your relationship with him your commitment to this message that he gave in this last day let's check our priorities and dig down deep for for a greater sincerity and for a deeper commitment whatever we have tonight let's give it to him let's commit it to him and sell out to him see what it is is the devil and God both try to get us to sell out the devil and God both try to get us to sell out and it's in two different ways God wants you to sell out all that you are to him to give all that you are to him even the parts that you find insignificant you a lot of times we don't withhold things from God because we're we because we're afraid to let them go sometimes we're we're embarrassed of what we have to give we don't think it's much we don't think God can do much with it and so so we hold it back and we withhold it but brother Brown says if you're honest and sincere God can appear to you yet in a dream he said it goes to show that anything you have whether it's your mind whether you can whistle right sing testify or whatever you can do if your whole being is committed to God God can use it if you'll just let him do it don't think it's it's insignificant see because we don't commit to God just so we can make it to heaven we don't commit to God just so we can uh make it over we commit to God so that he can use us while we're here so that we can be used in the hand of God while we're here because he will use anything that you give him even when others think it's not very much and I think about the story of of the young boy that had the the Five Loaves and the two fishes and and he was going off and brother Bram said he skipped school that day and he was playing hookie and he was going off and he happened to see uh Jesus teaching and he he drew close and listened for a little bit and anyway when the people got hungry they were searching for for food food and you know this part stood out to me in John 6 and8 and it says one of his disciples Andrew Simon Peter's brother saith unto him there is a lad here which hath five barley Loaves and two small fishes now hang on just a minute that's the gift the guy the boy had that's what he had to offer and maybe it's what you have to offer tonight and maybe this is how others feel about it but what are they amongst so many think of how discouraging that must have been for the little boy I want to give it to him but I even heard his disciples say what is this going to do what what is that gift in a church of 200 who's going to notice me doing that how is that going to be a help to anybody it's a little nothing gift your gift may be that you love people and that you make people feel loved well watch that that's huge we live in a world of people dying for love dying for affection your gift may be that you know how to cook and say you take people a meal every now and then when they're whatever it is it may not seem like much but I'm saying commit it to God committed into his hand and and and the disciple says but what are they among so many he doesn't see value in it brother what could my gift be in a in a service like this I'm just so insignificant that what I can do is so meaningless I I even heard one of the disciples let's bring it right on down I even heard one of the deacons say what good would that gift be I can't throw deacons under the bus I heard one of the preachers there say what good would that gift be think about it it doesn't matter what anybody else thinks about your gift it doesn't matter what anybody thinks about your significance he thinks you're very significant and he's saying commit it to me give it to me what would I can do with it I can I can bless the whole kingdom of God with it I can dare Satan's kingdom down with it I can bring joy in somebody's life with it I can brighten somebody's day with it just give me the gift that you have and I love verse 11 and it says and Jesus Took the loaves that's all that matters right there he'll take what you have to offer tonight whatever it is if you'll just come and put it in his hands and Jesus Took the loaves quit dismissing what you've got and just give it to him he ain't going to turn you down he's going to take the loaves he's going to take whatever you have to offer he wants you tonight he wants all of you tonight the parts you think are insignificant the parts you don't like he wants them tonight he wants you to be committed to him tonight whatever condition you're in tonight whatever you have to offer tonight just say Jesus can have it Jesus can have it my life's in shambles but Jesus can have it I don't got much to offer tonight but Jesus can have it whatever I've got I'm just going to give it to Jesus tonight I'm going to commit It All to Jesus before we move on there's some people that's got real big gifts they don't want to give to Jesus I started to go but I couldn't if you got gifts in your life surrender them to him and let him use your gifts because it ain't about you well I don't like being in front of people I don't like listen don't get me starred on what I like and don't like cuz here I am it ain't about what what you like it ain't about well I don't think I don't if you got a gift and you know you got a gift and it blesses people use your gift that God's given you give everything you've got to him brother Brown says here's what it teaches us that God can use every faculty of our being if it's committed surrendered to him he can use our mind our dreams our subconscious our first conscious our tongue our songs our eyes everything that we have can be used of God if it's committed to God see everything that you are committed to God he'll use every outlet and every part of you he'll use it no matter what it is he'll use it if it's Sanctified to his purpose and calling he'll use it we just got to be more committed to him tonight but see the devil wants you to sell out in another way the devil wants you to be a sellout and there's a difference a sellout is a person who compromises their personal values Integrity Talent OR gifts for money or personal advancement or an easier path to success to make a deal that compromises loyalty a traitor he wants you to be a sellout with what God has given you in this day he wants you to take the easier path that's a sellout he wants you to compromise on what the prophet meant when he said this that's a sellout he wants you to back off the promises of God a little bit and say well you know it don't have to be that way God don't move the way he used to move that's a sellout Satan is looking for people to compromise on the word he's looking for people to lay down their rights and walk away he's looking for those that that that give up on some of the standards just a little bit to Over the Bar just a little bit for an easier path so maybe we won't be so odd maybe we won't stand out so much that's a sellout and Satan's looking for these people he's looking for balam's who was gifted he's looking for Esau's who who who had the birthright he's looking for the 10 spies that that came out under a prophet but then they said it was too difficult to take the land they said maybe we should back off our expectations a little bit man maybe the New Birth really won't keep you God don't do what he used to do he's wanting you to sell out your Birthright tonight prophet of God says and how many tonight how many people has sold out their Birthright to the things of the world and got away from God stay with the word he said those spies that that went over to spy the land came and they even eat the grape that Joshua and Caleb brought back and yet what did they do they sold out their birth rights and you know sometimes it's in the message and and we quote it a lot and talk about a lot about Elvis Presley and how he was gifted and came up in the Pentecostal ranks and how he sold out for money and sold out for riches and sold out for Cadillacs and and we like to point to him and use him as an example but I'd like to say there's a lot of people today that sell out for a whole lot less than one he sold out for people that are willing to sell out just to keep a little bit of Peace willing to sell out so they'll fit in a little bit better at work or fit in a little bit better at school right willing to sett out so they're they're not embarrassed to say that I believe God sent a prophet and what do you get in return except for selling your Birthright except for losing your Birthright but I believe with all my heart that God's got a people on the Earth tonight that is purposed in their hearts that it doesn't matter what I have to stand against what what Hell Comes against me it doesn't matter what evil is all around me and who turns their back on me I will not back up I will not give in but I am committed to finish I'm committed to stay with this message I'm committed to the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm committed to the word of God I'm committed to everything that God has given us in this day I'm committed to seeing this thing all the way through I'm not going to take nothing for what God's called me to be I'm not going to take nothing for the experience of the new birth I'm not going to take nothing for seeing our young people born again I'm not going to take nothing for the Rapture and the body change I'm not going to stop short I'm going to finish this thing out to the end I won't sell my Birthright for anything I won't take anything short of what God has already promised me that's the attitude of his bride tonight I'm not going to take nothing short of going all the way back to the original faith that was once delivered to the Saints I'm not going to go halfway back and then say we don't get the Holy Ghost like we used to I'm not going to go some other way back and say the Holy Ghost won't keep us like it used to I'm not going to stop short but I'm going to go all the way back brother Brown says today we have little sensation and little isms that breaks us up and separates little evidences and little everything else that separates us he says it shows that we've never come to that place where we're completely sold out to almighty God and stand on the pillar of his Eternal Word and say I now claim the faith that was once delivered to the Saints not from your lips but from your heart not an intellectual conception but a born again experience that makes you a change creature that's the faith that was once delivered to the Saints not willing to give up anything that God's given us not willing to sell out a little thing but committed to finish in this age because the currents of the world blow and the the currents of unbelief blow and and Satan tries to wear at us over time and when he begins to get you worn down and where he feels like you're eroded a little bit that's when he comes and begins to offer compromises he begins to offer you opportunities but but because of the truth now now listen to me as we go through this for a little bit because of the truth and because of the light that has been granted to us because of that God expects us to be able to stand because of what he's done in this day because he's gone to Great Links and and done extreme things in order for us to recognize his presence that the whole world word is restored that the seals are open because he's given us that he expects us to overcome he expects us to be to be able to stand and and because he expects us to be committed to what he has given to us in this world today and a lot of you will will know what I'm talking about that there's a lot of good people there's a lot of good Christian people a lot of people who claim Christianity and and and I look at them and I see people who live a good life and they have a testimony that they hold with what truth that they have they live what they have to the fullest and they have a testimony with what light they have and the Bible tells us that they're going to be granted life for that testimony that they held so so follow me as we go there but you've been given great light you've been given a great message it's the message of restoration it's the message of Malachi 4 and and all the truths have been restored and according to Revelation 10 all the Mysteries have been finished you are the recipient of all that in other words he committed the message into your hands he came and gave it to you all of that has been given to you you know the truth of the church ages you know the truth of baptism you know the truth of the serpent sea you know the truth of godhead the seals are open to you he he committed all that into your hands what a commitment that he's given to us and because of that what a commitment he requires from us we don't have the excuse tonight of I didn't know we don't have the excuse of ignorance tonight we don't get by on we did the best we could with what we had because you have everything there's nothing withheld from you he could give you nothing greater he gave you the best thing he could give you now he expects you to overcome with it he committed this message to us and now he expects us to be committed to it Luke 1248 and I want to go through a few scriptures here and maybe this will be slow for a minute and that's okay but I want us to understand what God expects from us he expects a committed people a a people who are all in Luke 12:48 says but he that knew not and did commit things worthy of Stripes notice they didn't know better but they broke a law they didn't know better but they did something worthy of a beating he says shall be beaten with few Stripes notice the ignorance is actually taken into account they're not going to get a full beating they didn't know better they're going to be beaten with few stripes and then he goes on to say For unto whomsoever much is given of him shall much be required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the more so notice there's still some punishment they don't get off scottf free for their ignorance but it's lightened you'll find this in numbers 15 and 29 if we can go there this is where this comes from in the Old Testament numbers 1529 it says you shall have one law for him that sinth through ignorance in other words he's going to have a totally different law for him that sinth ignorantly both for him that is born among the children of Israel and for the stranger that sojourneth among them notice ignorance excuses part but not the whole there's still punishment it's just not as severe so so so there will be punishment but it's going to be lighter that there's how I there's somewhat of an excuse there for him that there's somewhat of I just didn't know even the Jews in their crucifixion of Jesus you find that in their defense ignorance is mentioned look in Acts 3:17 with me acts 3:17 it says and now Brethren I want that through ignorance you did it as did also your rulers look in 1 Corinthians 2 and8 which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not crucified the Lord Of Glory their ignorance is cited for a reason for their shortcoming their ignorance is cited for a reason for them messing up in Luke 23 Jesus even pleads their ignorance when he says father forgive them why because they know not what they're doing Jesus even pleads the case of ignorance but look at those who know and choose not to do what's right we're going to go back to numbers 15 and 30 we read 152 29 but now in 15:30 it says but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously he knew better whether he be born in the land or a stranger the same reproacheth the Lord and that Soul shall be cut off from among his people even in like Tabernacle we're not going to get by on I didn't know we're not going to get by on it wasn't revealed to us it wasn't give to given to us we're not going to be able to get by on being halfway in and halfway out look others may may may get the punishment of tribulation and then be granted life and maybe they have a defense of ignorance they stood the best they could with with what they had but to Those whom this message has been committed to those who the seals have been open and who the Mysteries have been finished what Jesus say For unto whosoever much is given of him shall much be required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the more even in like Tabernacle we have to be committed to the truth we have to be all in and committed to truth because truth has been committed to us so what do we got to be found doing in this day is defending the truth standing for the truth Walking In Truth living the truth not giving up even a little bit not not compromising even a little bit cuz you won't be able to say I didn't know it's been given to you it's been committed to you it's been placed in your hands now I ask you what are you going to do with it there in Revelations 2 when Jesus is talking about that church age he addresses those from the Ephesian age and notice Revelation 2 and 2 it matters to him that we defend the truth it matters to him that we stand for truth it matters to him that we call those out that are liars he says I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou cast not bear them which are evil thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them liars and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake hath labored and HTH not fainted what's he saying here he's saying you've been Defenders of the truth you've stood for truth when others would slander it you you've stood for truth when others would compromise you wouldn't back down even though the age began to drift you stood for truth he has tried them which say they are Apostles and have found them Liars brother Brandon points to verse two if you go back to verse two and he says he says that the work the labor and patience here in verse two were from guarding the sacred word which had been committed to them how they kept away the adversaries he says what a credit they were to Paul notice God noticed that they were committed to truth he noticed that they wouldn't back off and he he puts it in his Holy Scripture he noticed that they protected it he noticed that they guarded it and I want to tell you in the in the currents of this world and the in the movements and shaking in the world that's going around us you got to protect truth you've got to guard truth with your whole heart because if you let your mind lean that way even a little it'll begin to get Warped and you won't know what truth is you've got to guard the truth that's God's given you hold fast that which thou pass be committed to finish the race it's a message that's been committed to us and I'm going to say it again we must be committed to it committed to it against adversaries committed to it against liars and against all the currents of society that would come in and try to erode it and I say tonight evening like Tabernacle don't waver from the truth of this word don't water it down but say what the prophet said say it how the prophet said it take all of it take the parts that hurt and take it take the parts that feel good and take it take all of it and stand for it and protect it and be committed to all of it because we cannot claim ignorance he placed the truth in your hands now what will you do with this Jesus called Christ and now look I don't want I don't know how this came across I don't want it to come across as a negative thing I don't want it to come across is a scary thing this is a glorious thing why does he expect you to overcome why does he know that you're going to overcome but why because he knows he gave you exactly what you needed to overcome he gave you the word he says this will do it this will overcome the evil day just commit to it and you'll make it just commit to it and you'll overcome just commit to the word this is what I'm giving you to be victorious with he expects you to win the battle he expects you to overcome the age because he's given you exactly what you have need of to overcome the age with you know brother bandam talks about it he says countries are always trying to arm their soldiers with the newest and the greatest and the best and this country gets a new technology so this country has to go and try to come up with another one and this country gets new armor piercing bullets so they have to come up with new armor to counteract it and it's constant advancement armies Advance equipment Advance athletes are constantly advancing because of new and modern training but see God is infinite and he can't never have a better thought than the first thought so he gave us the best to begin with when he gave you his word he gave you the best to begin with when he said by my stripes you're healed he gave you the best to begin with when he said repent and be baptized you'll be filled with the Holy Ghost he gave you the best to begin with when he said you'll be there and your Offspring will be there with you he gave you the best to begin with just hold on to the best hold on to the weapon he gave you fight with that weapon and you shall overcome hallelujah it's the best it's the best thing that he could give you it's the word of God and he knows that if you're committed to it it'll still conquer demons he knows that if you're committed to it it'll still overcome the age he knows that if you're committed to it it'll still conquer the devil any place anywhere anytime under any circumstance es what circumstances are you in tonight I guarantee it fits into any and this word will overcome the devil my home's tore up it'll overcome the devil my child's astray it'll overcome the devil my family's sick this will overcome the devil we're surrounded by evil this right here will overcome the devil it'll produce a Rapture it'll take men and women who are committed to it out of this world Hallelujah so let the devil change his tactic let times change let them forget who genders are let lgbtq rage all over let it do whatever let his tactics change God gave us the best with the first thing he gave us and it's the word of God hallelujah he don't have to think of nothing better to give us so we can make it he gave us the best to begin with and we don't have to dress this message up we don't got to dress it up we don't got to improve the gospel it was the best the minute it was handed to us amen and whenever we're committed to it and when whenever it's our all in all I believe we can all testify to this that when we're sold out and it's our all in all then let the storms come let the winds blow let the waves come but it'll Crest every single wave it'll see you through to the other side every single time it never said the storms wouldn't come he never said the devil wouldn't how it never said sickness wouldn't come it never said those wouldn't fall away he just said it'll Crest every single wave just hold to the ship stay with it commit to it commit to this word right here and it's going to see us all the way over to the other side commit to finish stay with the word stay with the word tonight Hallelujah in spite of the evil in spite of the age that we live in despite all the unbelief and everything that's against us we're going to finish this raceu Hallelujah but unfortunately the devil's never going to stop punching he's going to punch and scream and kick and he's going to punch at you he's going to throw all that he has at you because he doesn't want the bride to cross this Finish Line Victorious so he's looking for sellouts and sometimes he's going to land some of those punches don't think you're defeated because you've been hit it's like I've always said if you're in a boxing match don't run back to the corner wondering what in the world's going on when you get punched it doesn't matter if you get punched is who's still standing at the end who's still standing when the final bell sounds you're going to get punched and the devil's going to land some of those punches brother Brown says now Satan will constantly punch at you until you're finished here on Earth until you're finished here on Earth he said just remember that you'll never have a time never have a time but what there's a punching going on all the time because you're in a battle see he's looking for your weak spot he's looking for that place where he can wound you we weak spot brother Aaron but but we're Christians Christians have weak spots oh yeah right we all have weak spots and it's up to you to keep yours covered at all times he says remember Satan's got a Punch coming at you don't care who you are he's got a right for that one punch see he's got somewhere he can punch you he's got a right to that open place think about it now now that's the spot you've got to keep covered all all the time and it's different in each and every one of us where he's going to punch me maybe not the same place he's going to punch you you know your nature you know your weak points you know where you're easily tempted you know where the devil tries to come in it's different for every single person in this room but that's the spot you've got to keep covered in your life he says and I know you have to watch him because he hits low and fouls he's a keep shot artist he don't follow the rules he doesn't fight fair he's doing everything he can to get you to get down and to stay down amen but God didn't call us to start a race God didn't call me to run half a race God called me to finish a race in this day and it don't matter if I get knocked down day after day we're going to get up Time After Time day after day again and again and again but CU we're committed to finishing this [Applause] race it it doesn't mean that you're you're never going to make a mistake because you're committed I make plenty of mistakes I get punched just the same as you get punched I may get hit and fall down but I can't stay down I can't go back I can't turn back no matter what happens tonight I'm going to declare I'm going to press on I believe evening night Tabernacle is going to press on on I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to press on because we hadn't been called here to fall short we've been predestinated not too fall we're going to make it listen let me give you a news flash we win this thing we win this thing there's days you don't feel like a winner there's days you're downtrodden there's days you beat down but in the end we win this thing we overcome we rapture we get a body change we get eternal life we get the streets of gold we get our loved ones we get eternity with Jesus Christ we win this thing hallelujah hallelujah he says but a man that's once knocked down if he's a real Soldier he'll rise up again he says Lord let me rise and try again don't stay down because you got hit tonight don't stay down because the devil's attacking get up get up tonight there's no need feeling sorry for yourself get up the race is still going the battle's still going why sit you there until you die get up and try again get up and fight some more get up and press the battle get up make sure that thing's covered that got you knocked down get up covered by the blood and let's try again whatever you was lacking or whatever you left exposed fix it get back in the battle he says I got lots of respect for a man when he does make a mistake he's got courage enough to rise and try again we're all going to make mistakes the best make mistakes but a soldier is not one who will lay down when he's knocked down but will raise up again listen if you need more from God tonight then get some more if you know you falling short then get what you need if your life doesn't testify being sealed then get sealed but whatever you got to do let's do it and let's keep going let's get what we're lacking and let's press the battle tonight strive for more recognize your need for more and let's press to the finish line and as you're pressing and as you're fighting you can expect attacks and you can expect questions you can expect if thou be if you're really a daughter of God if you're really a Son of God if you really got what you claimed to have gotten he brings constant questions even questions about what you believe if this message is right if it's really the last days if it really matters how we dress listen brother brand he said now if thou be the Son of God see he's always doubted it he still teaches others to doubt it he taught Eve to doubt it taught Moses he taught all of them to try to doubt it he's teaching you to try to doubt it and you that's sitting right here now if you want me to call your names Satan's been trying for a long time to get you to doubt me he's going to try to teach you to doubt we live in a world of skepticism we live in a world of Doubt just because thoughts come into your mind don't sit there and think oh I'm a sinner just say Satan that's not me that's you and I'm casting that down those ain't my thoughts but brother Aon I have bad thoughts man get in line well brother Aaron I doubt sometimes get in line I'm like the man that was speaking to Jesus Lord I believe help thou my unbelief we still have those battles we still have those doubts and you're going to continue cuz he's trying to teach you to doubt but I love the story that that brother Bram tells about driving his daughter to school and he's in the car and he's got the radio playing and he's listening to the radio and as he's listening he says they have some scientists on there and they're explaining how the world came to be and with some chemicals coming together and a few explosions and some sunlight hit this germ and because of that everything came into existence and and he says he got sick of listening to it and he turned it off he said he dropped his daughter off at school and he started to turn it back on he thought no there'll probably still be that same mess so he didn't turn it on he said but then Satan started talking to me and started saying to him you know Jesus was just a man like any other man maybe like a Billy Graham and a few people gathered around him and believed him for a while but now he's dead and gone and that's all of it can you IM imagine talking to the prophet of God like this a man who had witnessed what he had witnessed and seen what he had seen and experienced all that he experienced and the Devil comes and says Jesus ain't even real he was just a man and I love what brother brandham says let's take a little example from this he says I thought how a liar you are and then I turned just as I was crossing Graham Street and I said Satan you that's been talking to my conscience I'd like to ask you a few things who was it that the Hebrew Prophet spoke of that would come who was the anointed Messiah what was upon those men who foresaw him and told his life thousands of years before he got here who was it that foretold it just to the letter and when he come they said he was numbered with the transgressors and he was and he was wounded for our transgressions and he was and he made his grave with the rich but he would rise up on the third day and he did and then he promised the Holy Ghost and I've got it so you just might as well get away from it because it's written in the word and every word is true then he left just because I give him the word that doesn't he can't stand the word he can't stand the word listen to me you've been getting knocked down with doubt you've been getting bombarded with questions just pour the word on him like a doctor pours antibiotics on on top of a sickness just pour it on him till he's got to leave just keep pouring it on him and pouring it on him just like Jesus in the wilderness it is written it is written it is written because Satan can't stand the word it is written behold I send unto you Elijah the prophet it is written to him that overcometh it is written by his stripes you were healed it is written we shall not all sleep for every question he comes to it is written I say we start punching back some we start throwing the word back at him who is it that was to have their hearts turned back who is it that it speaks of to him that overcometh who is it that was seen in the eternals shouting the victory who is it that's been called out who is it that's been healed by his stripes who is it that's been delivered who is it that's still standing in Satan's edting who is it that's going to finish the race who is it that he's coming back for it's me it's me it's his bride and I'm standing in Satan's eating who is it devil it's me I know it's true because I see it fulfilled in my life who is it that's overcoming your Eden Hallelujah yes he's going to punch you but it's time we punch back it's time we give him the word hallelujah he's given us everything we have need of to finish this course hold fast tonight use every weapon persevere get up be committed commit your everything to him and when you do when you cast all your cares on him and I love this and I'm going to close with this then he takes responsibility for you prophet of God says he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has that right but Jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key it's on his shoulder but what does shoulder have to do with it read Isaiah 9 and6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does this mean the answer is this the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the East when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over on the groom's shoulder signifying that not only is she under his Dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he Bears the responsibility and the care that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility he says and that beloved is the Key of David God being Sovereign he fornew by a Divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone and this is my favorite line in the whole thing she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation I say commit to him tonight but brother Aaron my life's in shambles he accepts the obligation brother Aaron I'm struggling he accepts the obligation I don't know if I can make it he has accepted the obligation to make sure you make it my home falling apart he accepts the obligation he's going to see you through he's responsible for you oh and now he deals with the debt collectors he deals with the one coming after you he deals with the one that says you can't go in you can't make it you sin too much he says no no you're going to have to talk to me I've accepted the obligation my blood paid the price my Holy Spirit was sent back I've accepted the obligation because they have committed themselves holy unto me blessed be the name of the Lord he accepts your obligation tonight he's going to take care of every one of your needs Hallelujah he has accepted the obligation oh blessed be the name of the Lord you stand to your feet with us tonight musicians if you'll come can you throw your
