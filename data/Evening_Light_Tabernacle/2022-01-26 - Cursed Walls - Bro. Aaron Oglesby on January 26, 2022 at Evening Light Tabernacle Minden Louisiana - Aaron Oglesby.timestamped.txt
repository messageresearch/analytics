[36:10] adam's race was totally lost
[36:13] lord the chief captain
[36:15] you yourself took on flesh and came down

[36:19] lord you came down and you took on my
[36:21] sin and you took on my shame lord lord

[36:34] lord we want to look to you tonight the

[36:38] many of us tonight may be facing
[36:40] roadblocks maybe facing decisions lord
[36:42] maybe facing hindrances in our life
[36:44] that's trying to keep us from all that
[36:46] you want us to be but lord i know
[36:48] tonight you will make a way lord i'm
[36:50] just asking that you come now and take
[36:52] complete control of this service
[36:54] lord may everything that's said and done
[36:56] bring glory to your name father
[36:58] ask these things now in your precious
[37:00] name jesus name
[37:02] amen amen
[37:04] isn't it wonderful to be in the house of
[37:06] god tonight amen
[37:09] we have quite a bit of scriptures i want
[37:11] to read but we'll just read the first
[37:12] one and i'll let you have your seats
[37:13] before i continue on
[37:15] if you have your bibles i ask you to
[37:17] turn with me to numbers the 13th chapter
[37:21] numbers the 13th chapter and the 25th
[37:24] verse
[37:25] numbers 13 25.
[37:28] it's wonderful once again to be gathered
[37:30] together in the house of the lord have
[37:32] this opportunity
[37:35] with believers of light precious faith
[37:37] we say that but don't let it become
[37:38] common it is a precious faith
[37:40] it's something to hold on to and be
[37:42] willing to fight for
[37:45] amen it says in verse 25
[37:48] and they returned from searching of the
[37:50] land after 40 days
[37:52] and they went and came to moses and to
[37:54] aaron and to all the congregation of the
[37:56] children of israel unto the wilderness
[37:59] of quran to kadesh and brought back word
[38:02] unto them and to all the congregation
[38:05] and showed them the fruit of the land
[38:08] and they told him and said we came unto
[38:11] the lamb whether thou send us us and
[38:13] surely it floweth with milk and honey
[38:16] and this is the fruit of it i want you
[38:19] to notice that right now they have
[38:21] discovered that everything god has told
[38:23] them is the truth
[38:25] everything that he has said to them has
[38:26] turned out to be absolutely the truth in
[38:30] verse 28 they said nevertheless the
[38:32] people be strong that dwell in the land
[38:34] and the cities are walled and very great
[38:36] and moreover we saw the children of anac
[38:39] there amen you may have your seats
[38:43] if you'd like to also turn with me over
[38:46] to joshua 5 and verse 13.
[38:52] amen
[38:53] says and it came to pass when joshua was
[38:55] by jericho that he lifted up his eyes
[38:58] and looked and behold there stood a man
[39:00] over against him with his sword drawn in
[39:03] his hand and joshua went unto him and
[39:05] said unto him art thou for us are for
[39:08] our adversaries and he said nade but as
[39:11] captain of the host of the lord am i now
[39:13] come and joshua fell on his face to the
[39:15] earth and did worship and said unto him
[39:18] what saith my lord unto his servant and
[39:21] the captain of the lord's host said unto
[39:23] joshua loose thy shoes from off thy foot
[39:26] for the place we're on thou standest is
[39:28] holy and joshua did so i want you to
[39:32] notice that right before this great
[39:34] battle
[39:35] right when joshua didn't know exactly
[39:36] which way to go he knew what he had to
[39:38] do he knew he had to take the city but
[39:41] as he's sitting there and he's wondering
[39:42] and he's looking how i'm gonna do this
[39:44] sometimes we're in those situations how
[39:46] am i gonna do this and it's in that
[39:48] moment when jesus shows up it's in that
[39:50] moment where the holy spirit comes and
[39:52] gives you exactly what it is you have
[39:54] need of we go over into chapter 6 and we
[39:57] see that the battle plan is laid out as
[39:59] joshua begins to tell
[40:01] the congregation exactly what it is that
[40:03] they're going to do and we start in
[40:04] joshua 6 and verse 3 and it says and you
[40:07] shall compass the city all ye men of war
[40:10] and go round about the city once thus
[40:13] shalt thou do six days and seven priests
[40:15] shall bear before the ark seven trumpets
[40:17] of ram's horns in the seventh day you
[40:19] shall compass the city seven times and
[40:21] the priest shall blow the trumpets and
[40:24] it shall come to pass that when they
[40:25] make a long blast with the ram's horn
[40:27] and when you hear the sound of the
[40:29] trumpet all the people shall shout with
[40:31] a great shout and the wall of the city
[40:34] shall fall down flat and the people
[40:36] shall ascend up every man straight
[40:39] before him moving down to verse 20 it
[40:41] says so the people shouted when the
[40:44] priest blew the trumpets and it came to
[40:46] pass when the people heard the sound of
[40:48] the trumpet and the people shouted with
[40:50] a great shout that the wall fell down
[40:52] flat so that the people went up into the
[40:54] city every man straight before him and
[40:56] they took the city and they utterly
[40:59] destroyed all that was in the city both
[41:01] man and woman young and old and ox and
[41:04] sheep and ass with the edge of the sword
[41:07] now i want to move down once again to
[41:08] verse 25
[41:10] and it said and joshua saved rahab the
[41:12] harlot alive and her father's household
[41:15] and all that she had and she dwelleth in
[41:18] israel even unto this day because she
[41:20] hid the messengers which joshua sent to
[41:22] spy out jericho verse 26
[41:26] and joshua adjured them at that time
[41:28] saying
[41:29] cursed be the man before the lord that
[41:32] riseth up and buildeth this city jericho
[41:36] he shall lay the foundation thereof in
[41:38] his firstborn and in his youngest son
[41:41] shall he set up the gates of it
[41:44] amen i'd like to speak to you for a
[41:46] little while tonight on cursed walls
[41:49] cursed
[41:50] walls
[41:52] there in our opening scripture we see
[41:54] the return of the twelve spies
[41:57] they had gone over into the land to
[41:58] search it out and we know how it is that
[42:01] how that how that 10 of them came back
[42:03] and they returned with a negative report
[42:06] and one of the main things that they
[42:08] mentioned in their negative report one
[42:10] of the main things that stood out to
[42:11] them that scared them and one of their
[42:13] reasons was the walls of the cities
[42:17] the walls of the cities nevertheless the
[42:19] people are strong and the cities are
[42:22] walled and very great
[42:25] so despite following a vindicated
[42:27] message despite following a vindicated
[42:30] prophet despite the miraculous signs and
[42:32] wonders despite over and over the
[42:35] deliverance that god had provided
[42:37] yet these teals these ten spies still
[42:40] managed to look at the circumstances
[42:42] that surrounded them and allowed the
[42:44] walls that laid between them and their
[42:47] promises to make them doubt think about
[42:50] what these spies had seen in their
[42:52] lifetime these weren't sissies these
[42:54] weren't atheists these weren't people
[42:56] that didn't believe they had seen more
[42:58] with their eyes than probably you will
[43:00] ever see it says they were chosen
[43:02] because that they were leaders i mean
[43:04] these men were tough men they had just
[43:06] spent 40 days on a covert mission behind
[43:09] enemy lines spying out the land and yet
[43:12] something causes them to come back with
[43:13] a negative report
[43:15] something causes them to come back and
[43:17] look it's okay to me
[43:19] if you doubt and you struggle okay i can
[43:21] tolerate that but when you bring a
[43:23] negative message to cause others to
[43:25] doubt and because you can't believe you
[43:27] come with the negative message and begin
[43:29] to bring others down and hurt their
[43:31] faith and hinder their faith that's
[43:33] where we have to draw the line
[43:35] and they come back and they bring a
[43:37] message of negativity and they bring a
[43:38] message that would cause others not to
[43:41] believe
[43:42] cause others to doubt
[43:44] and i asked you tonight what was the
[43:46] difference in the reports
[43:49] what caused there to be such a
[43:50] difference and the difference was that
[43:52] those men chose to look at
[43:54] what those men chose to look at versus
[43:57] what joshua and caleb chose to look at
[43:59] when they were in the other land notice
[44:01] caleb doesn't dispute with them what
[44:04] their report is
[44:05] caleb doesn't say i
[44:07] i didn't see any giants
[44:10] and there were walls what are you
[44:11] talking about i didn't see any walled
[44:13] cities caleb doesn't dispute with them
[44:16] as a matter of fact it almost seems that
[44:18] as we read these verses of the report
[44:20] that there's no disagreement at all
[44:22] until it comes down to whether or not
[44:24] they can take the land
[44:27] if we'll go back and look in verse 27
[44:29] numbers 13 and verse 27 it says and they
[44:32] told him and said we came into the land
[44:34] whether thou sent us us and surely it
[44:36] floweth with milk and honey
[44:38] caleb's like yup that's right
[44:39] sure does there's an agreement there
[44:41] nevertheless the people be strong that
[44:43] dwell in the land and the cities are
[44:44] walled and very great and moreover we
[44:46] saw the children of maniac there and
[44:47] he's like
[44:48] oh i saw some cities okay
[44:51] i can go with that and there were
[44:53] children of ainak there oh okay
[44:56] he's just listening to them and the
[44:58] amalekites dwell in the land of the
[45:00] south and the hittites and the jebusites
[45:02] and the amorites dwell in the mountains
[45:03] and the canaanites grow by the sea and
[45:06] by the coast of jordan and he's just
[45:07] they're going okay can we get through
[45:09] this report come on
[45:11] oh that's fine oh that's fine but you're
[45:13] missing the good part you're skipping
[45:15] the part where god said go up and take
[45:16] the land you're skipping the part where
[45:18] he already gave it to us you're skipping
[45:19] the most important part what did god say
[45:21] about the land
[45:23] and they keep saying this and it says
[45:24] but the men that went up with him
[45:26] excuse me i'm going to go back to 29 and
[45:28] jebusites and the amorites dwell in the
[45:30] mountains and the canaanites dwell by
[45:31] the sea and by the coast of jordan and
[45:34] caleb says okay that's fine and in verse
[45:36] 30 he steals the people and he says
[45:38] you're right good job giving the report
[45:40] now let's go take it
[45:42] brother aaron let me give you a report
[45:44] the world is evil politics are rotten
[45:46] copens on the rampage cancer seems
[45:48] everywhere that's fine let's go take the
[45:49] land that's fine let's keep on walking
[45:52] that's fine let's do what god called us
[45:54] to do but it's bad it's bad and we're
[45:56] okay that's true i'm not arguing with
[45:57] you on that point i'm telling you god's
[45:59] already given us the land god's already
[46:01] said go and possess it
[46:07] he says let's go up at once and possess
[46:09] it for we are well able to overcome it
[46:11] but the men that went up with him said
[46:13] we be not able to go up against the
[46:15] people for they are stronger than we
[46:18] now we have a disagreement
[46:20] this is the first place where they say
[46:22] wait a minute i can't go with you there
[46:24] wait just a minute and at this point
[46:27] they bring up a negative report notice
[46:29] it says in verse 32 and they brought up
[46:31] an evil report of the land because they
[46:34] weren't willing to go take it now they
[46:36] have to convince others that they
[46:38] shouldn't go take it as well
[46:39] just because i'm not going to walk in
[46:41] the fullness of the holy ghost let me
[46:43] talk it down to everybody else just
[46:45] because it's not operating in my church
[46:47] let me talk it down to everybody else
[46:49] just because i haven't possessed what
[46:50] i'm supposed to possess let me talk it
[46:52] down to everyone else
[46:57] says they brought up an evil report of
[46:58] the land which they had searched unto
[47:00] the children of israel saying the land
[47:02] the which we have gone to search it is a
[47:03] land that eateth up the inhabitants now
[47:05] notice
[47:06] earlier it was just factual things
[47:09] now suddenly this is about to get grand
[47:13] it's fitting to turn into a grand story
[47:16] with boogeymen and monsters and
[47:17] scarecrows to keep you away
[47:20] it eats it eateth up its inhabitants
[47:23] thereof and all the people now they
[47:26] didn't just see some giants
[47:28] everybody
[47:31] was men of great stature there wasn't
[47:33] even one that wasn't
[47:36] all the people
[47:38] where's men of great stature
[47:41] and
[47:43] when somebody's trying to tell you a
[47:44] story trying to get you to believe
[47:45] something they're kind of overselling it
[47:47] not only were they great stature they
[47:50] were giants man you just said that
[47:54] you just repeating yourself now at this
[47:56] point
[47:57] and there were giants the son of anac
[47:59] which come
[48:00] which come up the giants well that would
[48:02] make sense and we were in our own site
[48:04] as grasshoppers and so were we in their
[48:08] sight
[48:10] you know this this report here reminds
[48:12] me
[48:13] of churches that want to say we believe
[48:15] in the moving of the spirit we believe
[48:17] in the gifts and we believe that they
[48:19] should be out there operating somewhere
[48:22] in the body
[48:24] somewhere in the body but they
[48:26] conveniently say it doesn't mean that we
[48:28] all have to have it or has to be in this
[48:29] church but conveniently somewhere in the
[48:32] body but when you begin to tell them hey
[48:34] you can possess that you can take that
[48:36] you can go get a hold of that god
[48:37] promised that to you and to your
[48:39] congregation and your people suddenly
[48:40] there's an evil report well we want to
[48:42] be careful about emotion
[48:44] oh them tongues they're a little bit out
[48:46] of place let's be careful with that and
[48:48] suddenly there comes up an evil report
[48:50] and you take them to the scriptures and
[48:52] you take them to the quotes and you so
[48:53] show them whenever the word says you can
[48:55] have it the word said it's for you it's
[48:56] wrong and all of a sudden they rallied
[48:58] the very people sit the spa out the land
[49:01] with you begin to rally the people to
[49:02] stone you because you're standing for
[49:04] the word because you're standing for the
[49:06] movement of the spirit because you're
[49:07] standing for everything and now they
[49:09] want to stone you
[49:11] and they rally together
[49:13] and come against you the ones who went
[49:15] to spy out the land with you your
[49:16] brothers
[49:17] your brothers in arms as it were
[49:24] but what was the difference
[49:27] caleb and joshua saw the walls
[49:30] they saw the same things but they chose
[49:32] not to focus on that
[49:35] their focus was on the promise
[49:38] their focus was on the supernatural
[49:40] that they had been following for years
[49:44] they had been following the supernatural
[49:46] for years and they they knew it was the
[49:48] supernatural that had brought them out
[49:49] of egypt
[49:50] they knew it was the supernatural that
[49:52] that had opened up the red sea
[49:54] they knew it was the supernatural that
[49:56] had fed them there in the wilderness
[49:58] with manna from heaven
[50:00] and now you're telling me it's going to
[50:01] take the supernatural for us to overcome
[50:03] this land
[50:04] and they went
[50:06] okay
[50:07] we're good with that
[50:09] we're fine with that and i'm telling you
[50:12] that we've been following a supernatural
[50:14] message for years we've been following
[50:16] the supernaturalness the supernatural
[50:18] that's kept us it's the supernatural
[50:20] that's brought us this far it's the
[50:21] supernatural that saved us it's the
[50:23] supernatural that's filled us it's a
[50:25] supernatural that heals us and you want
[50:26] to tell me it's going to take the
[50:28] supernatural for us to rapture and i'll
[50:30] say okay i'm okay with that i've been
[50:32] walking in the supernatural i've been
[50:34] living in the supernatural
[50:37] we are a supernatural people we believe
[50:39] a supernatural message and i say we're
[50:41] okay with that
[50:43] if it must be supernatural then that's
[50:46] okay
[50:50] walls
[50:52] the other spies saw walls
[50:57] they saw what it was that could keep
[50:59] them from their promise
[51:01] joshua and caleb saw only fulfillment
[51:04] they saw that everything that he had
[51:06] said this far had come to pass
[51:09] they said you know what
[51:11] why does this thing keep popping
[51:14] is there something i'm doing i just
[51:15] wonder if i can fix it you're good so
[51:17] no just let it pop
[51:22] twist it
[51:24] away
[51:25] okay
[51:26] all right is that going to help is that
[51:28] it
[51:29] wonderful
[51:30] i went as long as i could i was like i
[51:32] ain't going to find anything bother me
[51:34] ain't going to bother me
[51:36] man okay it's bothering me
[51:40] went a long time
[51:41] well it's not the sound man we got new
[51:43] mics first time i've ever worn it so
[51:47] yeah we're going to take the land this
[51:48] evening
[51:52] you know joshua and caleb looked at it
[51:53] and said he's got a pretty good track
[51:55] record
[51:56] everything he said thus far
[51:58] has come to pass
[52:00] and i would like to ask steven like
[52:01] tabernacle can you point to anywhere
[52:03] where his track record has failed
[52:05] is there a time that we can point to
[52:07] that he's let us down or that he's left
[52:08] us
[52:09] or that he's disappointed us his track
[52:11] record is perfect so i say tonight we
[52:13] can look at his track record and say if
[52:15] he said we can take the land i don't
[52:17] care what's standing there to oppose us
[52:19] let's go up and take the land tonight
[52:21] god had said it and to joshua and caleb
[52:23] that that settled it brother branham
[52:26] says the cities are all walled in we
[52:28] cannot take it but caleb stealed the
[52:30] people joshua and said we can take it
[52:32] we're more than able yet we being the
[52:35] minority we can take it why those spies
[52:37] were looking at the conditions what the
[52:40] price they'd have to pay but caleb and
[52:42] joshua was looking at a promise of god
[52:44] god said i have given you the land now
[52:48] go and possess it
[52:50] listen our attitude towards the promises
[52:52] of god is what's going to determine
[52:53] whether or not you possess those
[52:55] promises
[52:56] not just an acknowledgement of well the
[52:58] word is true not just an acknowledgement
[53:01] of well yes god does those things not
[53:03] just an acknowledgement of well we found
[53:05] the land exactly how you said we would
[53:07] find the land it's not just an
[53:09] acknowledgement but it's an attitude of
[53:11] give me my mountain today i'm going to
[53:13] go take it today not just at god heals
[53:16] but god is my healer today i'm going to
[53:18] tear down those walls and to get my
[53:19] healing today
[53:21] it's not just that he will it's that he
[53:23] has and he's doing it right now for me
[53:25] and he's doing it right now for you and
[53:26] he's on the scene this very moment
[53:29] not just an acknowledgement but let's go
[53:32] take it at once i will have my mountain
[53:37] well how can we say that with such
[53:38] assurance
[53:40] how can we say that tonight with such
[53:41] confidence
[53:43] because the chief captain has come down
[53:45] because the chief captain has come down
[53:48] and every wall that stands in our way is
[53:50] absolutely no match for our chief
[53:52] captain you don't have to worry you
[53:54] don't have to figure it all out tonight
[53:56] the chief captain is here on your behalf
[53:59] you just have to have faith that the one
[54:01] that brought me out the one that fed me
[54:03] in the wilderness the one that opened
[54:04] the red sea he's the one that's gonna
[54:06] see me all the way through he brought me
[54:09] out he's gonna take me in
[54:11] just have confidence that the one whose
[54:14] track record has never failed will not
[54:16] fail now
[54:19] as i was with moses so will i be with
[54:22] thee see i will be with you
[54:26] there's nothing uncertain about it i'll
[54:28] be with you
[54:30] he told joshua years later as i was with
[54:32] moses so i will be with you how am i
[54:34] going to take these great walled cities
[54:36] that's not for you to figure out
[54:38] i was with moses i'll be with you and
[54:41] everywhere your foot treads is
[54:43] possession
[54:44] just keep walking
[54:47] see nothing's going to stand before you
[54:49] all the days of your life nothing
[54:50] uncertain about that i will be with you
[54:55] he'll be with the church
[54:59] remember brother mickey when he was well
[55:00] enough to be with us he would always say
[55:02] just keep walking
[55:04] that was something he said all the time
[55:06] brother mickey everything going okay
[55:08] just got to keep walking
[55:09] just got to keep walking what a truth
[55:11] there is in that just take another step
[55:13] tonight people just take another step
[55:15] and keep walking and just keep trusting
[55:18] look the truth is in this life the devil
[55:20] is going to battle you every step you
[55:22] take
[55:23] he's going to do everything he can to
[55:25] stand before you when you go to obtain
[55:27] your inheritance he's going to fight you
[55:30] when you go to obtain your promises he's
[55:32] going to fight you
[55:34] he
[55:35] you are going to encounter trials you're
[55:37] going to encounter hardships you're
[55:39] going to encounter enemies you are going
[55:42] to encounter walls
[55:46] these walls are intended to keep you
[55:48] from your promises
[55:50] brother branham says look what he said
[55:52] here's a good thought he told moses i've
[55:54] given you palestine it's yours and it
[55:57] was all walled up and fortified with
[55:59] philistines and big walls around it but
[56:01] i give it to you it's yours now go take
[56:04] it there's the idea go take it divine
[56:07] healing's yours go take it it's
[56:08] fortified up with the doctor's belief
[56:10] and agnostic belief and everything else
[56:12] go take it god said it's yours amen the
[56:15] holy ghost is yours go take it
[56:18] your pastor don't believe it but the
[56:19] bible said it was so go take it it's
[56:22] god's word you know how them 10 come
[56:24] back said oh we look like grasshoppers
[56:26] we can't do it joshua said yes we can
[56:28] god said so that's the promise i believe
[56:30] it peter said the promise is unto you
[56:32] and your children and to them that's a
[56:34] far off even as many as the lord our god
[56:36] shall call amen
[56:38] i believe the baptism of the holy ghost
[56:40] and all the fullness of god is raining
[56:42] down on the church today it's for
[56:44] whosoever will god promised it in his
[56:46] word it's ours let's take it let's go
[56:49] over and possess the ground
[56:51] amen let's go over and possess the
[56:56] ground we see there in joshua five
[57:02] in our second reading that
[57:04] years have passed
[57:06] and once again joshua is looking at the
[57:08] same walls
[57:10] that he had looked at many years before
[57:12] when he came to the land as a spy
[57:16] you know many times when we fail to
[57:17] handle something that we're supposed to
[57:20] it's going to come back around on us
[57:21] later on
[57:25] every time
[57:28] now i know it wasn't joshua's fault that
[57:29] they hadn't done this before but still
[57:32] he finds himself staring at the same
[57:34] walls because israel had failed to go
[57:36] and deal with these walls 40 years
[57:37] before
[57:39] and now here they are facing the exact
[57:41] same issue that they was before
[57:43] church we got to deal with issues as we
[57:45] come to them
[57:47] we got to stand and fight when things
[57:49] come to us not tell and run not put our
[57:51] heads in the sand if it comes before you
[57:54] now fight now overcome now be victorious
[57:57] now face it now because shirking our
[57:59] responsibilities and putting our head
[58:01] down in the sand doesn't make the issue
[58:02] go away it doesn't make the thing you're
[58:05] struggling with go away he said you
[58:06] could possess the land so just square
[58:08] your shoulders back it may not be fun it
[58:10] may not be easy but if you don't face it
[58:12] today you're going to face it tomorrow
[58:14] and if you don't face it tomorrow you're
[58:15] going to face it later on and all you're
[58:17] doing is allowing that thing to gain
[58:19] strength in your life
[58:20] you're allowing it to get a deeper root
[58:22] you're allowing it to get a deeper hole
[58:24] deal with it when you come to it
[58:26] deal with it the first time you have an
[58:28] opportunity
[58:29] don't let it become so ingrained in your
[58:31] life that you actually begin to believe
[58:33] this is who i am this is my personality
[58:35] this is just how i operate no it's not
[58:39] and you knew it when it first came in
[58:40] before you petted the thing and coddled
[58:42] the thing and allowed it to stay there
[58:44] instead of manning up being a man being
[58:46] a son of god and a daughter of god
[58:48] saying we'll deal with this thing now
[58:51] in the name of jesus
[58:53] deal with things as they come up
[58:56] and here is joshua finally getting the
[58:58] opportunity to set right
[59:01] what wasn't done 40 years earlier
[59:04] and he's looking over jericho wondering
[59:06] what's the best way to attack
[59:08] now look he wasn't looking at it in
[59:10] doubt
[59:11] he knew he was going to attack
[59:13] and he knew he was going to win
[59:16] but being a godly leader he's looking at
[59:17] it going what's the best way
[59:20] he's praying about it he's looking at
[59:22] the enemy and he's wondering how are we
[59:23] going to do this exactly and in that
[59:25] moment he sees a man
[59:27] joshua 5 13 and it came to pass when
[59:30] joshua was by jericho that he lifted up
[59:31] his eyes and looked and behold there
[59:33] stood a man over against him with his
[59:35] sword drawn in his hand that right there
[59:39] is enough to shout about
[59:41] listen he's not standing back with his
[59:42] arms folded saying let's see if brother
[59:44] joe can do this let's see if evening
[59:46] like tabernacle can make it through
[59:47] let's see if they can get through this
[59:49] trial i want to know if they can defeat
[59:50] this devil no sir his sworn is drawn
[59:52] he's going to battle for you he's
[59:54] leading the charge he's out front he's
[59:56] slicing heads off he's taking you to the
[59:59] promised land he is in the battle with
[1:00:01] you he's fighting the battle for you how
[1:00:03] can we lose how can we not be victorious
[1:00:05] the one who's never lost a battle is
[1:00:07] right here in the battle with us and his
[1:00:09] sword is in his hand
[1:00:11] his sword is drawn and he's fighting the
[1:00:13] battle for you
[1:00:14] that right there is enough
[1:00:16] that right there is enough to be happy
[1:00:18] about
[1:00:18] and joshua i ask are you one of us are
[1:00:21] you one of our adversaries and in verse
[1:00:22] 14 he says nay
[1:00:24] but as captain of the host of the lord
[1:00:26] have i now come
[1:00:30] i'm telling you tonight whatever
[1:00:31] situation you find yourself in you've
[1:00:34] been seeking him you've been looking for
[1:00:35] leadership you've been looking for a
[1:00:37] victory over your adversary and he
[1:00:39] stands before you tonight with the sword
[1:00:41] drone and his word to you tonight is
[1:00:44] tonight as the captain of the lord's
[1:00:46] host i have come down to fight your
[1:00:49] battles for you
[1:00:50] i have come down to conquer this battle
[1:00:52] for you i have come down to lead you
[1:01:03] but
[1:01:05] there's a but to that yes
[1:01:09] but you got to do what it is that i ask
[1:01:11] you to do
[1:01:14] you got to follow the battle plan
[1:01:17] you know sometimes we don't conquer
[1:01:21] sometimes we don't overcome sometimes
[1:01:24] the wall don't fall down like
[1:01:28] it said it would
[1:01:30] then i wonder did we follow the battle
[1:01:32] plan
[1:01:36] did we follow the word the way we were
[1:01:38] told to
[1:01:39] did we do things the way the angel told
[1:01:41] us to do them
[1:01:44] i really have wondered
[1:01:46] through the years
[1:01:47] when i would read this scripture what
[1:01:49] some of the men thought as joshua laid
[1:01:51] out the plan
[1:01:53] i mean think about it maybe someone were
[1:01:55] great men of war
[1:01:57] maybe maybe someone were great at
[1:01:58] strategy and they had planned this
[1:02:00] battle and they had planned that battle
[1:02:01] they knew exactly how to strike and
[1:02:02] which side to come from and joshua
[1:02:05] begins talking i can see him in the
[1:02:06] background wait
[1:02:10] so we're going to walk around it
[1:02:14] oh
[1:02:14] okay
[1:02:15] i'm with you
[1:02:17] when do we attack
[1:02:19] when are we going to charge when are we
[1:02:20] going to go straight for the gate
[1:02:22] no no we're just going to walk around it
[1:02:26] okay
[1:02:29] i mean i don't know man i've been
[1:02:30] through a lot with him but this just
[1:02:31] don't make sense
[1:02:33] what are we gonna do the next day
[1:02:35] you're gonna love this
[1:02:37] we're gonna walk around it again
[1:02:39] what
[1:02:42] we're gonna walk around it again so
[1:02:44] we're just gonna walk
[1:02:47] we're just going to walk
[1:02:49] what's he teaching them in this moment
[1:02:51] what's he teaching you in this moment
[1:02:54] he's teaching you yes you've got a part
[1:02:56] to play yes you got to follow the plan
[1:02:58] but it's not going to be by might it's
[1:03:00] not going to be by force it's not going
[1:03:02] to be by anything you do but by my
[1:03:04] spirit saith the lord that's how you're
[1:03:06] going to conquer the gate of your enemy
[1:03:08] it's going to be by doing what he said
[1:03:10] and yes you have to do that you have to
[1:03:12] do your part but it's him that's going
[1:03:14] to tear the walls down look sometimes it
[1:03:16] don't make sense
[1:03:18] sometimes we don't understand
[1:03:20] where are we going why is he leading
[1:03:21] this way
[1:03:22] why did i have to do that sometimes
[1:03:24] young people are the worst i don't
[1:03:25] understand why this matters
[1:03:28] i don't understand why this matters
[1:03:30] nobody asked if you did
[1:03:32] and i'm not picking on you i've been
[1:03:34] there it probably took me longer to
[1:03:35] outgrow that than a lot of people
[1:03:37] okay just being honest you read
[1:03:40] something you're like
[1:03:41] why
[1:03:43] because it's the battle plan
[1:03:46] what else do you need to know
[1:03:47] because it's the battle plan and he said
[1:03:49] if you follow the battle plan you're
[1:03:50] going to be victorious that's good
[1:03:51] enough for me i want to be victorious i
[1:03:54] want to overcome i want to take a
[1:03:55] rapture i want healing i want salvation
[1:03:57] for my children so i'm just going to
[1:03:59] follow the battle plan i'm just going to
[1:04:00] do what it is that he tells me to do
[1:04:04] do what i tell you to do and you will
[1:04:06] conquer all
[1:04:08] do what i tell you to do and those walls
[1:04:10] in your life will come down
[1:04:12] those strongholds will fall
[1:04:16] i imagine it looked kind of funny to
[1:04:17] those people in jericho
[1:04:20] i mean i know they were scared the bible
[1:04:21] says they were
[1:04:23] they were already frightened but it
[1:04:24] probably gave them hope when they looked
[1:04:26] out there and saw their attack plan
[1:04:29] they probably thought
[1:04:31] you know what i think we got this
[1:04:33] they don't even have any weapons
[1:04:38] they're looking out there going what is
[1:04:39] it it's a jewish walkathon
[1:04:44] are they raising money
[1:04:46] and they begin to mock them
[1:04:48] y'all been walking all day
[1:04:51] are your feet turned
[1:04:54] look at y'all walking around for the
[1:04:56] fourth time oh i'm scared now yesterday
[1:04:58] was just once
[1:05:00] and they began to mock
[1:05:03] and they began to mock and they began to
[1:05:05] call out
[1:05:07] is this all you're going to keep doing
[1:05:08] is just keep on walking i can imagine
[1:05:10] one of them israelites thinking because
[1:05:11] they weren't allowed to talk
[1:05:13] that'd have been a hard one on me
[1:05:16] um
[1:05:23] what are you doing out there just gonna
[1:05:24] keep walking oh you've walked around the
[1:05:27] building six times today
[1:05:31] six times
[1:05:32] i can imagine him thinking
[1:05:34] you got about five minutes to live
[1:05:37] keep talking you got about five minutes
[1:05:39] to live because here just in a minute a
[1:05:41] gospel trumpet's gonna blow and when the
[1:05:43] gospel trumpet blows we're gonna begin
[1:05:44] to shout and we're gonna begin to praise
[1:05:46] the lord go ahead devil keep mocking the
[1:05:48] services at evening like tabernacle keep
[1:05:51] marking our worship keep mocking our
[1:05:53] praise you've got a few moments to live
[1:05:55] because the gospel trumpet is going
[1:05:57] forth and there's people that begin to
[1:05:59] shout and they begin to praise the lord
[1:06:02] and when the walls come down you've got
[1:06:04] nowhere else to hide
[1:06:06] you keep on mocking me your time's
[1:06:08] almost up go ahead go ahead the trumpet
[1:06:11] sounded
[1:06:13] the trump is sounding
[1:06:16] hallelujah
[1:06:21] go ahead and keep mocking
[1:06:23] whoo we come together and the gospel
[1:06:25] trumpet begins to sound
[1:06:27] we're here to tear walls down devil
[1:06:30] we're here to tear walls down
[1:06:33] we're here to take our promises tonight
[1:06:35] we're here to destroy walls of complex
[1:06:38] we're here to destroy walls of fear
[1:06:41] we're here to destroy the works of the
[1:06:42] devil
[1:06:44] we're here to tear down walls of
[1:06:45] sickness
[1:06:46] and we're here to set free every rahab
[1:06:49] that's been trapped behind those walls
[1:06:51] who wanted to get out but the walls were
[1:06:53] too high and they didn't know how to get
[1:06:55] out that's okay we're about to bring the
[1:06:57] walls
[1:06:58] down hallelujah
[1:07:04] ain't it something
[1:07:08] that it was the shouting
[1:07:11] that came after the trumpet sounded that
[1:07:13] caused the walls to fall
[1:07:16] i like that
[1:07:19] but brown says and so
[1:07:22] apparently in this service
[1:07:24] there's some racing going on outside the
[1:07:26] building as loud
[1:07:29] brother brown says and so if we could
[1:07:30] just race up the highway to heaven like
[1:07:33] that
[1:07:34] wouldn't we be doing something
[1:07:36] like those jalopy races going on out
[1:07:38] there
[1:07:39] but i don't believe they can drown me
[1:07:41] out
[1:07:42] i don't believe they can we'll just
[1:07:44] shout that down if the walls of jericho
[1:07:47] fell by some shouting why a little bit
[1:07:49] wouldn't hurt now would it maybe the
[1:07:52] shackles would fall off then
[1:07:54] why you got churches full of people
[1:07:56] bound why you got churches full of
[1:07:57] people bound down and oppressed and they
[1:07:59] can't be free and they can't be loosed
[1:08:01] the walls are still standing there ain't
[1:08:03] been no shouting in a while there ain't
[1:08:05] been no freedom in a while there ain't
[1:08:06] been no joy in the camp there ain't been
[1:08:08] no victory in the camp why not do the
[1:08:10] people not want to be free of course
[1:08:12] they want to be free
[1:08:14] of course they want to be free but
[1:08:15] there's somebody in the pulpit holding
[1:08:17] their thumb down on them that won't let
[1:08:19] them get loose won't let them get free
[1:08:22] rahab was trapped
[1:08:24] she couldn't get out she was stuck in
[1:08:26] there she wanted to be free she wanted
[1:08:27] to rejoice she wanted the baptism of the
[1:08:29] holy ghost but it took the worship of
[1:08:32] somebody else it took the worship of
[1:08:34] people on the outside saying wall come
[1:08:37] down wall come down wall come down
[1:08:41] oh i tell you what be an example be a
[1:08:44] worshiper be appraiser let your shout
[1:08:46] tear wall down
[1:08:49] hallelujah
[1:08:53] let's free some right hands
[1:08:55] some people that won't out
[1:08:58] hallelujah
[1:09:07] let the naysayers mock me i'm just
[1:09:09] following the battle plan
[1:09:17] joshua 6
[1:09:18] 20. so the people shouted when the
[1:09:21] priest blew the trumpets
[1:09:23] and it came to pass
[1:09:25] when the people heard the sound of the
[1:09:27] trumpet and the people shouted with a
[1:09:28] great shout
[1:09:30] that the wall fell down flat
[1:09:35] i say it's time to tear down some walls
[1:09:37] tonight
[1:09:38] it's time to let some shouts go up and
[1:09:40] some walls come down
[1:09:44] we were her bride
[1:09:46] predestinated not to fall
[1:09:49] facing walls tonight that are
[1:09:50] predestinated to fall
[1:09:52] i like those odds
[1:09:56] we can't lose
[1:10:00] walls
[1:10:02] what happened back there in the garden
[1:10:05] we're going all the way back to the
[1:10:06] garden of eden when man fell
[1:10:09] our inheritance our rights
[1:10:12] and our position in christ was walled up
[1:10:13] from us
[1:10:16] health was walled away and death reigned
[1:10:19] peace was walled up and fear rain
[1:10:22] joy was walled up sorrow and sadness
[1:10:24] rain
[1:10:26] it seemed like at that point we could
[1:10:27] never attain to what god had intended
[1:10:30] man to attain to
[1:10:32] it seemed like humanity stood no chance
[1:10:34] against the walls of satan
[1:10:38] there was a chief captain
[1:10:41] there was a chief captain that came down
[1:10:44] you know the jews expected him to come
[1:10:45] down and tear down physical walls
[1:10:48] they thought when the messiah came he
[1:10:49] would tear down the walls of the roman
[1:10:51] empire and tear down the walls and
[1:10:53] restore the kingdom of israel back to
[1:10:55] what they perceived it should be to
[1:10:57] defeat the romans
[1:10:59] but it was about so much more than that
[1:11:02] this was about walls around your life
[1:11:05] this was about walls around my life
[1:11:08] this was about walls that kept us from
[1:11:09] eternal life
[1:11:11] walls that kept us from healing and
[1:11:12] walls that kept us from ever going in
[1:11:15] and claiming the land and claiming our
[1:11:17] inheritance and our position
[1:11:20] and there at calvary he began
[1:11:22] in one failed swoop and one act he tore
[1:11:25] down every single wall that the enemy
[1:11:27] had
[1:11:29] he destroyed everything that the enemy
[1:11:31] had built up walls around peace were
[1:11:32] destroyed
[1:11:34] walls around healing were destroyed
[1:11:37] walls around your salvation were
[1:11:38] destroyed
[1:11:40] and then he sends back his spirit on the
[1:11:42] day of pentecost and men and women are
[1:11:44] endued with power from on high
[1:11:46] and they began to operate in freedom
[1:11:51] there was freedom in that first church
[1:11:53] because they were no longer walled in
[1:11:56] there was no walls binding them they
[1:11:58] weren't walled by tradition they weren't
[1:12:00] being ruled by man and ideas of man
[1:12:03] but they were being led by the great
[1:12:05] chief captain they were being led by the
[1:12:07] holy spirit
[1:12:14] following the plan that he had laid out
[1:12:15] for them that day on the day of
[1:12:16] pentecost
[1:12:18] they were a free people
[1:12:20] they were a powerful church they were
[1:12:22] attaining all that god had promised them
[1:12:25] they weren't afraid to face a wall of
[1:12:27] sickness
[1:12:28] they weren't afraid to face a demon and
[1:12:30] cast him out they weren't afraid of
[1:12:33] prophecies they weren't afraid to
[1:12:36] testify of visions that were amongst the
[1:12:38] people they weren't afraid of the gifts
[1:12:41] operating in the church the way that
[1:12:42] they were supposed to operate in the
[1:12:44] church
[1:12:45] the gifts of the spirit were in full
[1:12:47] operation in that church just as god
[1:12:49] intended and intends for them to be
[1:12:53] the walls had fallen
[1:12:55] and what god destroys
[1:12:58] he does not want built back
[1:13:05] joshua 6 26
[1:13:07] and joshua adjured them at that time
[1:13:09] saying
[1:13:10] cursed be the man before the lord
[1:13:13] that riseth up and buildeth this city
[1:13:16] jericho
[1:13:17] he shall lay the foundation thereof in
[1:13:19] his firstborn
[1:13:21] and in his youngest son shall he set
[1:13:23] upon the gates of it
[1:13:25] in other words when he lays the
[1:13:27] foundation his firstborn son will die
[1:13:32] and when he sets the gates
[1:13:34] his youngest son will die
[1:13:38] god had destroyed jericho not israel god
[1:13:41] had done it
[1:13:42] and he destroyed it because he wanted it
[1:13:44] destroyed and when god destroys
[1:13:47] something he says cursed
[1:13:49] is the man
[1:13:50] who will rebuild this
[1:13:53] cursed is the man that'll try to put my
[1:13:55] people back in bondage after i freed him
[1:14:00] from the church age book brother brown
[1:14:01] says paul saw it coming
[1:14:04] but he warned him about this subtle
[1:14:06] priesthood that would come and take over
[1:14:07] with false doctrines
[1:14:09] he knew they would implement a way of
[1:14:11] worship that excluded the people from
[1:14:13] any part in a holy spirit ministry
[1:14:17] and even right today among those who
[1:14:18] claim to be free and full of the spirit
[1:14:20] there is not too much freedom in the
[1:14:22] laity
[1:14:23] and the best we can see is a few
[1:14:25] preachers with inspired preaching while
[1:14:27] the flock just sits there and tries to
[1:14:30] absorb it now notice this isn't the
[1:14:32] flock's fault
[1:14:35] this is what they've been taught and
[1:14:37] this is what they've been beat over the
[1:14:38] head with time and time and time and
[1:14:42] time again
[1:14:43] to where they don't realize they can be
[1:14:44] free from that
[1:14:46] this is a far cry from paul who said
[1:14:49] that when we all came together
[1:14:52] all
[1:14:53] say oh
[1:14:55] had the leading of the spirit and
[1:14:58] all participated
[1:15:00] in spiritual worship
[1:15:04] what
[1:15:07] me
[1:15:09] oh
[1:15:12] paul knew that man would once again
[1:15:14] build walls
[1:15:16] how did paul know this well
[1:15:18] we can assume by revelation
[1:15:20] but also because he knew exactly what
[1:15:23] religious men without the baptism of the
[1:15:24] holy ghost would do with the word
[1:15:26] because he had once been that man
[1:15:28] and what had he done with the word
[1:15:30] before he had the baptism of the holy
[1:15:32] ghost he used the word to kill
[1:15:35] and to destroy
[1:15:36] and he knew exactly what men would do
[1:15:39] if they didn't get to the baptism of the
[1:15:41] holy ghost
[1:15:43] and it didn't take long until man began
[1:15:45] to brick
[1:15:46] by brick
[1:15:47] build back walls that god had torn down
[1:15:50] that nicolet and spirit began to work
[1:15:52] among the church brother branham says it
[1:15:54] taught a control over the people but
[1:15:56] instead of doing it's god's way they
[1:15:57] simply took authority invested all the
[1:16:00] spiritual power in their own hands and
[1:16:02] came out with a holy priesthood standing
[1:16:04] between god and the people they went
[1:16:06] right back to the old aaronic system
[1:16:13] so when you do these things you're not
[1:16:15] just going back several church ages
[1:16:16] you're going all the way back before the
[1:16:18] blood of jesus christ
[1:16:21] to the old testament
[1:16:25] one of the first things that that spirit
[1:16:28] wanted to do
[1:16:29] was to wall up the supernatural
[1:16:31] experience of the new birth
[1:16:35] and to rob the supernatural working of
[1:16:37] the spiritual gifts among the laity
[1:16:41] because if you're not gifted and i say
[1:16:44] you can't operate gifts and you don't
[1:16:46] have gifts and it doesn't work that way
[1:16:48] anymore then guess who's the only person
[1:16:51] that's gifted
[1:16:57] because obviously i am because i'm the
[1:16:59] priest
[1:17:02] but there's no gifts anymore operating
[1:17:04] out there
[1:17:05] so automatically just by getting you to
[1:17:07] accept that i get you to be subservient
[1:17:09] to me
[1:17:12] because there's no more gifts and now
[1:17:13] i've conquered the laity
[1:17:18] and so they they get to where they don't
[1:17:20] want the working of the spiritual gifts
[1:17:22] among the laity
[1:17:24] see taking away the gifts of the
[1:17:25] supernatural working of the spirit among
[1:17:28] the people is step one of taking away
[1:17:30] the new birth
[1:17:32] are you saying you have to have a gift
[1:17:34] like tongues or a gift working in order
[1:17:36] to have the new birth no i'm not saying
[1:17:37] that at all that's not where we're going
[1:17:39] at all but when the spirit is walled up
[1:17:41] and the gifts of the spirit is walled up
[1:17:44] the next thing that happens is they wall
[1:17:45] up the experience of the new birth and
[1:17:47] replace it with all you got to do is
[1:17:50] believe
[1:17:51] all you got to do is accept this
[1:17:53] doctrine all you got to do is believe
[1:17:54] that god sent a prophet
[1:17:57] just accept what i'm telling you you're
[1:17:59] okay
[1:18:00] just stay beneath me you're okay
[1:18:05] because they can't allow the gifts to
[1:18:06] operate because if the gifts begin to
[1:18:08] operate then that'll create an
[1:18:09] atmosphere that will then lead to a new
[1:18:12] birth
[1:18:13] so they must quench the moving of the
[1:18:15] spiritual gifts among the laity
[1:18:17] because in that atmosphere the spirit
[1:18:19] would be moving and the supernatural
[1:18:21] would be present
[1:18:23] brother aaron who would do this what
[1:18:26] kind of heathens would do this to the
[1:18:28] church of god
[1:18:31] what kind of people surely people weigh
[1:18:33] out there people that never knew of the
[1:18:35] message of the hour
[1:18:37] surely ignorant and unlearned people who
[1:18:39] didn't know the scripture
[1:18:42] brother branham tells us exactly
[1:18:44] who began this
[1:18:46] he says there's where the roman catholic
[1:18:48] church was formed out of a group of
[1:18:50] people that were converts of saint paul
[1:18:56] and irenaeus
[1:19:00] and saint martin
[1:19:02] he says and on down
[1:19:06] who was doing this
[1:19:08] converts of the message of the hour
[1:19:14] why are y'all always talking about this
[1:19:15] why are you always talking about this
[1:19:16] surely this is something a million miles
[1:19:18] away no sir
[1:19:20] it's converts of the message of the hour
[1:19:24] wolves in sheep's clothing
[1:19:38] followers of the message of the hour
[1:19:40] no
[1:19:41] yes
[1:19:44] absolutely
[1:19:45] they began to build walls that god had
[1:19:47] cursed
[1:19:48] walls that god had turned down
[1:19:51] brother branham says god never intended
[1:19:52] the church to be run by men god runs his
[1:19:55] church and he runs it through gifts of
[1:19:57] the spirit
[1:20:01] the gifts of the spirit is in the church
[1:20:04] to correct the spirit
[1:20:06] he's got five ministerial offices in his
[1:20:08] church apostles prophets teachers
[1:20:10] evangelists pastors now that's the
[1:20:11] elected offices of god to his church
[1:20:13] then in each
[1:20:15] each
[1:20:16] local church there's nine spiritual
[1:20:19] gifts that come among the people that is
[1:20:21] knowledge wisdom gifts of healing
[1:20:23] working of miracles speaking with
[1:20:25] tongues and interpretation of tongues
[1:20:28] and all these things go in each local
[1:20:31] body guys i'm not making this up
[1:20:35] this is the prophet of god this is
[1:20:37] malachi 4.
[1:20:40] we either believe it all or we don't
[1:20:46] each local body and every person in the
[1:20:50] church has an individual ministry
[1:20:54] what
[1:20:57] can you imagine what freedom that would
[1:20:59] give to a congregation of people who
[1:21:00] were held under the thumb of a dictator
[1:21:05] i may be wrong but i don't think this
[1:21:07] quote's getting read everywhere tonight
[1:21:09] or tomorrow or the next day or ever
[1:21:14] and the individual ministry goes
[1:21:16] together with the rest of the ministry
[1:21:18] to edify the body of jesus christ
[1:21:22] look it's no wonder that down through
[1:21:24] the ages the gifts were lost
[1:21:26] because the priest and the minister saw
[1:21:28] the power that came from being the only
[1:21:30] ones with the gift
[1:21:33] the devil saw how powerless the church
[1:21:35] would be without the supernatural
[1:21:39] believing became a substitute for
[1:21:42] experiencing
[1:21:45] yes you must believe
[1:21:48] but you must experience
[1:21:52] you must believe and
[1:21:54] experience
[1:21:56] the true experience of the baptism of
[1:21:58] the holy ghost is lost
[1:21:59] and carnal men like the ten spies began
[1:22:02] to teach that it wasn't needed anymore
[1:22:04] you know when one quote brother branham
[1:22:05] calls the ten spies theologians
[1:22:08] he says those ten were theologians
[1:22:16] from a church history
[1:22:19] i wish i'd have wrote down which one it
[1:22:20] was that felt so vague to say from
[1:22:22] church history
[1:22:25] it says especially important in this
[1:22:27] regard
[1:22:28] is the concentration of spiritual
[1:22:30] authority and ministry in the office of
[1:22:33] bishop and priest in the emerging church
[1:22:36] of rome
[1:22:37] by the early fourth century and much
[1:22:39] earlier according to some there was
[1:22:41] already a move to limit the opportunity
[1:22:43] to speak
[1:22:45] to serve and minister in the life of the
[1:22:48] church to the ordained clergy in other
[1:22:50] words you had to be ordained clergy to
[1:22:53] speak serve or minister in any way
[1:22:56] lay folk were silenced and marginalized
[1:22:59] and left almost entirely dependent on
[1:23:01] the contribution of the local priests
[1:23:04] or bishop
[1:23:07] this next thing actually was very
[1:23:09] shocking to me
[1:23:10] because it's amazing sometimes when you
[1:23:12] go back and read different quotes from
[1:23:13] different messengers how much they line
[1:23:15] up
[1:23:16] messengers from ages gone by
[1:23:20] quote from john wesley
[1:23:23] that the grand reason why the miraculous
[1:23:25] gifts were so soon withdrawn
[1:23:28] was not only that faith and holiness
[1:23:31] were well not lost
[1:23:33] but dry
[1:23:34] formal orthodox men began even then to
[1:23:38] ridicule whatever gifts that they had
[1:23:40] not themselves
[1:23:45] there it is
[1:23:47] they began to ridicule dry
[1:23:49] orthodox men began even then to ridicule
[1:23:53] whatever gifts they had not themselves
[1:23:55] and to decry them all as
[1:23:58] madness or impostor
[1:24:01] or that's just wildfire
[1:24:04] if we put it in our terms
[1:24:06] those tongues were out of place
[1:24:12] carnal man began to say that only the
[1:24:14] prophet can operate those gifts
[1:24:16] colonel man began to wall off these
[1:24:18] gifts from the laity and from the
[1:24:20] congregation
[1:24:23] roll them off from the people until
[1:24:24] brother branham would say it was all
[1:24:26] being choked out of it like a python
[1:24:28] he said just slowly choking the life out
[1:24:30] of the church
[1:24:32] pardon me as i quote john wesley once
[1:24:34] again
[1:24:36] from this time they almost totally
[1:24:38] ceased talking about the supernatural
[1:24:39] miraculous works
[1:24:41] very few instances of the kind were
[1:24:43] found the cause of this was not as has
[1:24:46] been supposed
[1:24:48] as has been supposed that they were no
[1:24:50] longer needed
[1:24:52] the real cause was that the love of many
[1:24:55] almost all so-called christians has wax
[1:24:59] cold
[1:25:00] the christians had no more of the spirit
[1:25:02] of christ than the heathens
[1:25:04] the son of man when he came to examine
[1:25:06] his church could hardly find faith upon
[1:25:08] the earth
[1:25:09] this was the real cause of why the
[1:25:11] extraordinary gifts of the holy ghost
[1:25:13] were no longer to be found in the
[1:25:14] christian church because the christians
[1:25:16] were turned heathens again and had only
[1:25:19] a dead form left
[1:25:23] hey it's heavy i know
[1:25:25] it's heavy on me
[1:25:30] man to begin to go back to torn down
[1:25:32] walls
[1:25:34] begin to wall themselves in again until
[1:25:37] once again man was walled off from the
[1:25:39] power of god
[1:25:40] walled back into a system of man going
[1:25:43] back to jericho once again brother
[1:25:45] branham said anytime you go to jericho
[1:25:47] you're backsliding he said because
[1:25:48] you're going away from jerusalem you're
[1:25:50] heading back towards the wilderness
[1:25:52] you're walking away from the promised
[1:25:54] land
[1:25:55] he says jericho was always a cursed city
[1:25:57] since the jews possessed palestine
[1:25:59] joshua said cursed is the man that'll
[1:26:01] build this city jericho always
[1:26:03] represented backslidden
[1:26:06] going back to the wilderness
[1:26:09] but god wouldn't leave it like this
[1:26:12] god began to move in luther and he began
[1:26:14] to move and wesley
[1:26:16] and then god tore down the walls of
[1:26:18] formality in 1906 in the azusa street
[1:26:21] movement and he restored the gifts once
[1:26:23] again to the church and then god threw a
[1:26:25] message in this day came and
[1:26:27] demonstrated once and for all that the
[1:26:29] supernatural is to be evident and
[1:26:32] operated and manifested in the church
[1:26:35] once and for all settled the issue the
[1:26:38] most supernatural message to ever strike
[1:26:40] the earth even his contemporaries would
[1:26:42] say bible days are here again
[1:26:44] the most supernatural message as night
[1:26:47] after night he battled the walls before
[1:26:48] foreign formality night after night he
[1:26:51] battled the walls of god don't do that
[1:26:54] anymore
[1:26:55] night after night he battled the walls
[1:26:57] of your just holy rollers
[1:26:59] and night after night he tore those
[1:27:01] walls down
[1:27:04] brother branham would say the old saying
[1:27:06] that the days of miracles is passed
[1:27:09] the walls is tore down
[1:27:13] cursed is the man who would rebuild them
[1:27:19] first kings 16 29
[1:27:23] and in the thirty and eighth year of asa
[1:27:26] king of judah
[1:27:27] began ahab the son of omri to reign over
[1:27:30] israel and they have the son of armory
[1:27:33] reigned over israel and samaria 22 years
[1:27:36] let's get down to 31 and it came to pass
[1:27:38] as it had been
[1:27:39] a light thing for him to walk in the
[1:27:41] sins of jeroboam the son of nibat
[1:27:44] that he took a wife jezebel the daughter
[1:27:46] of ethibol king of zedonians and went
[1:27:49] and served baal and worshiped him
[1:27:53] and he reared up an altar for baal in
[1:27:54] the house of baal which he had built in
[1:27:56] samaria
[1:27:58] and ahab made a grove and ahab did more
[1:28:00] to provoke the lord god of israel to
[1:28:02] anger than all the kings of israel that
[1:28:04] were before him now i read that to get
[1:28:06] to this
[1:28:07] because it's under the leadership and
[1:28:09] guidance of ahab
[1:28:11] a backslidden
[1:28:13] lukewarm
[1:28:14] fence riding preacher
[1:28:17] that this happens in verse 34.
[1:28:21] in his days did hail
[1:28:23] the bethelite build jericho
[1:28:25] he laid the foundation thereof and
[1:28:27] abhiram his firstborn and set up the
[1:28:30] gates thereof and his youngest son sagab
[1:28:33] according to the word of the lord which
[1:28:35] he spake by joshua the son of none
[1:28:38] under the leadership of one who was
[1:28:40] afraid to stand up
[1:28:42] who was afraid to honor the word who was
[1:28:45] afraid to say everything that's in the
[1:28:46] word is going to happen everything
[1:28:48] that's in the word is supposed to be
[1:28:50] there
[1:28:51] under that leadership
[1:28:53] high ill
[1:28:55] builds back jericho i found it
[1:28:57] interesting that his name means god
[1:28:59] lives
[1:29:03] i also found it interesting that his
[1:29:05] firstborn son abraham his name means my
[1:29:08] father is exalted
[1:29:12] somewhere something went wrong
[1:29:14] someone got lifted up
[1:29:17] someone got exalted and thought
[1:29:18] everything that was in here didn't
[1:29:20] matter
[1:29:21] somewhere somebody began to think you
[1:29:22] know i know that's what the scripture
[1:29:24] says but we don't need that anymore
[1:29:26] i need to protect my people from
[1:29:28] fanaticism
[1:29:30] so i'm going to build this wall back up
[1:29:35] jewish tradition would show that hell
[1:29:37] was actually a general in israel in
[1:29:39] direct contact with ahab
[1:29:41] not only does he lose his firstborn when
[1:29:43] he laid the foundation and his youngest
[1:29:44] when he sets the gate but every one of
[1:29:46] his other children die in the process of
[1:29:48] the construction
[1:29:52] oh my we must rebuild this because it's
[1:29:54] on the road that goes to jerusalem it
[1:29:56] just makes sense brother joe
[1:29:58] we must rebuild this to protect our
[1:30:00] interests after all it'll be an israel
[1:30:02] israelite city now so it'll be okay
[1:30:05] this just makes sense
[1:30:07] we should build this back we must
[1:30:09] rebuild it it makes sense to rebuild it
[1:30:11] but the word of god said don't rebuild
[1:30:14] the wall
[1:30:15] [Applause]
[1:30:17] but we can't have all this fanaticism
[1:30:19] and wildfire in the church
[1:30:22] we got to protect our people
[1:30:25] and so what we're going to do is we're
[1:30:26] going to point to the examples of the
[1:30:28] counterfeit as our reasons to build a
[1:30:30] wall in reality what it does is it keeps
[1:30:32] the people from the real thing
[1:30:39] brother aaron why do you want to see
[1:30:40] these things so bad why you preach the
[1:30:42] supernatural so bad why you preach the
[1:30:43] gift so much because god said they would
[1:30:45] be there
[1:30:46] because the word said they would be
[1:30:48] there and i want to see the fulfillment
[1:30:49] of all the word
[1:30:52] because everything listen to me
[1:30:54] everything and i'm going to back this up
[1:30:56] with a quote
[1:30:57] everything that we believe
[1:31:00] is built around the supernatural
[1:31:03] everything and if you take away the
[1:31:05] supernatural what are you left with but
[1:31:07] another dead creed another dead theology
[1:31:09] another morgue that brother branham
[1:31:11] preached about
[1:31:16] he says i'm just an old-fashioned just
[1:31:18] an old-fashioned backwoods preacher that
[1:31:20] believes in old-time heartfelt sky blue
[1:31:22] sin killing religion that's right that
[1:31:24] believes the old-fashioned way and i
[1:31:26] believe that man when he's born of god
[1:31:27] becomes a son of god the supernatural
[1:31:30] power of god dwells in him we have a
[1:31:32] supernatural god we have a supernatural
[1:31:34] life i believe that any man that's born
[1:31:37] of the supernatural spirit believes in
[1:31:39] the supernatural
[1:31:42] any man that's born of the supernatural
[1:31:44] spirit believes in the supernatural we
[1:31:47] got a supernatural resurrection we got a
[1:31:49] supernatural heaven we got a
[1:31:51] supernatural rapture i believe the whole
[1:31:53] thing's built up around the supernatural
[1:31:56] and if a man is born of the spirit of
[1:31:58] god he believes in the supernatural he
[1:32:00] can't help it because he's the son of
[1:32:02] god and that's the reason tonight we got
[1:32:04] so many old cold formal indifferent god
[1:32:07] forsaken backslidden churches because
[1:32:10] men and women are not born of the spirit
[1:32:12] of god
[1:32:13] they have no taste of god they know
[1:32:15] nothing about god and all they know is
[1:32:17] theology
[1:32:20] i don't believe i could have said it any
[1:32:22] harsher had i tried
[1:32:27] it's pretty cut and dry
[1:32:30] listen a weakened faith in the
[1:32:32] supernatural power of god
[1:32:34] operating in the church
[1:32:36] can only weaken your faith in god period
[1:32:43] in the same spirit that slowly began to
[1:32:44] build the wall
[1:32:46] up against the supernatural and the
[1:32:48] first church age is trying with all its
[1:32:49] might once again to build those walls in
[1:32:51] this age
[1:32:52] after god sent a prophet tore those
[1:32:54] walls down
[1:33:00] brother brown says and when the holy
[1:33:01] ghost has come upon you you'll be
[1:33:03] witnesses of me both in jerusalem judea
[1:33:05] samaria saskatoon and the uttermost
[1:33:07] parts of the earth and with the weapon
[1:33:08] that he left us he told us to dash into
[1:33:10] sickness and to sin and these signs
[1:33:13] shall follow them that believe men and
[1:33:15] women it's time that we picked up the
[1:33:16] weapon that our hero of god's love left
[1:33:18] us and dash out yonder and fight against
[1:33:21] ignorance and superstitions and
[1:33:23] formality and break down the walls of
[1:33:25] the enemy and display the real gallant
[1:33:27] love that we believe in god and his word
[1:33:30] till sickness is healed and devils are
[1:33:32] routed and the blind see and the death
[1:33:34] here god help me to do it as long as i
[1:33:36] got a breath left in my body
[1:33:41] as long as i got a breath left in my
[1:33:43] body as long as evening like
[1:33:44] tabernacle's still standing as long as
[1:33:46] we're still gathering here fight against
[1:33:48] formality fight against those walls
[1:33:50] being built back up again fight against
[1:33:52] that spirit coming into our churches
[1:33:55] fight against service that we call
[1:33:57] teaching because they're so dead and
[1:33:58] cold so we call it teaching so we can
[1:34:00] excuse the lack of anointing that's on
[1:34:02] it fight against those things yes
[1:34:09] the devil's built more walls than ever
[1:34:13] we're under attack more than ever
[1:34:16] but my god still tears down walls
[1:34:19] his people still tear down walls i say
[1:34:22] we need the supernatural in our midst
[1:34:24] now more than we've ever needed the
[1:34:26] supernatural in our midst
[1:34:28] i got a dad that needs the supernatural
[1:34:29] to destroy cancer i got a friend named
[1:34:32] ron spencer that needs a supernatural
[1:34:33] god to destroy cancer we got a friend
[1:34:35] named erica parker that needs a
[1:34:37] supernatural god to move on her behalf
[1:34:40] and destroy cancer and i'm not worried
[1:34:42] one little bit because he said i give
[1:34:44] you the land he said i'll go before you
[1:34:46] i see in the scripture that his sword is
[1:34:48] drawn his sword is in his head
[1:34:51] he tore down the wall and i will not let
[1:34:54] you i defied his spirit that would come
[1:34:56] back in and try to rob us of healing
[1:34:59] trying to rub my children of the baptism
[1:35:00] of the holy ghost
[1:35:02] you're not building that wall in this
[1:35:04] congregation
[1:35:06] you're not building that wall in this
[1:35:07] message this bride will not be
[1:35:10] denominated
[1:35:11] [Applause]
[1:35:21] more walls than ever means we need more
[1:35:22] faith than ever
[1:35:24] we need the supernatural operating to
[1:35:26] give faith more than ever
[1:35:29] goodness our rapture is supernatural
[1:35:31] we need the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:35:33] back in the church again we need
[1:35:35] miracles we need gifts we need sons
[1:35:39] oh i know
[1:35:41] i know our faith isn't based in a sign
[1:35:42] our faith isn't based in a gift our
[1:35:44] faith
[1:35:45] isn't based in a tongue i know
[1:35:48] that's not why our faith lies our faith
[1:35:50] lies in the unchanging word of god
[1:35:53] but listen to this brother branham said
[1:35:54] that he sends his gifts to confirm to us
[1:35:57] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:35:58] forever
[1:35:59] which builds faith
[1:36:02] gifts
[1:36:04] confirm the word
[1:36:07] brother branham says and your gifts that
[1:36:09] you send down to your church to conform
[1:36:12] to confirm your word that you promise
[1:36:14] people walk away and call it the works
[1:36:16] of the devil
[1:36:18] listen
[1:36:20] now remember the holy spirit's got to
[1:36:22] bring to god everything that every
[1:36:24] professing christian says about it
[1:36:31] that's why
[1:36:33] i take the stance brother branham took
[1:36:34] when those sisters was dancing in his
[1:36:36] church
[1:36:38] he said i chose not to say anything
[1:36:40] about it
[1:36:41] just in case
[1:36:44] they were right
[1:36:46] and i was wrong
[1:36:50] you don't have to understand it that
[1:36:52] person's following their battle plan
[1:36:59] now the church now is engaged to christ
[1:37:01] for the wedding the wedding has never
[1:37:02] been performed yet it will be at the
[1:37:04] wedding supper of the lamb so we see
[1:37:05] that the church is now engaged like a
[1:37:07] man engaged to his wife
[1:37:09] what does he do while they're engaged
[1:37:12] he's just bestowing all kinds of things
[1:37:13] sending her presents making her feel
[1:37:15] good well that's what christ is doing to
[1:37:17] his church he's sending us gifts of the
[1:37:19] spirit
[1:37:20] how can you be engaged then when you're
[1:37:22] denying these gifts exist
[1:37:24] it's the very love tokens it's god's
[1:37:28] tokens to the church jesus said so these
[1:37:30] signs shall follow them that believe but
[1:37:34] brother aaron the word was restored the
[1:37:36] word was restored nobody's arguing that
[1:37:40] i agree with you matter of fact here's
[1:37:43] what was restored brother branham says
[1:37:45] that's the way an old-fashioned revival
[1:37:47] is when you reach down and get a better
[1:37:49] hold step off of that cold formal creed
[1:37:52] over here get over here on the vine of
[1:37:54] the lord and go to eating the fruits and
[1:37:56] grapes of the vine of the lord amen i
[1:37:58] will restore saith the lord i will
[1:38:01] restore brother branham asks the
[1:38:02] question restore what
[1:38:05] all the beauty that she was at one time
[1:38:07] i will restore the same church that i
[1:38:09] had at pentecost i will restore the
[1:38:12] gifts of the spirit i will restore signs
[1:38:14] and wonders i will restore speaking in
[1:38:16] tongues i will restore the prophet i
[1:38:19] will restore all saith the lord
[1:38:23] all of it
[1:38:25] every last bit of it
[1:38:28] how must he feel when he sends out gifts
[1:38:30] to the one that's supposed to be his
[1:38:32] future bride his engaged one and they
[1:38:35] mock his gifts
[1:38:37] and they laugh at his gifts
[1:38:39] and they say we don't need this
[1:38:44] look at them
[1:38:46] i don't even think that was real
[1:38:49] and the holy spirit's telling him
[1:38:51] exactly what you said about
[1:39:01] trying to find a place to bring this
[1:39:02] down
[1:39:08] what good
[1:39:10] does it know the word what good does it
[1:39:12] to know the word intellectually
[1:39:16] the pharisees knew it better than any of
[1:39:18] us
[1:39:20] they knew it through and through and yet
[1:39:22] the word with life in it they hated
[1:39:25] they hated the word with life in it word
[1:39:28] with spirit in it they hated
[1:39:30] they hated him because he was the quotes
[1:39:32] of the prophets that they love to
[1:39:34] worship made flesh
[1:39:35] oh a lot of people love the quotes but
[1:39:38] they don't love quotes with life in it
[1:39:40] they don't like quotes with skin on it
[1:39:44] they don't like quotes with the spirit
[1:39:46] moving over them
[1:39:48] they don't like those kind of quotes
[1:39:51] because man is rebuilding a wall once
[1:39:54] again rebuilding is a spirit of
[1:39:55] catholicism a spirit of denomination
[1:39:57] it's a spirit of hell
[1:40:00] what's it doing
[1:40:02] what kind of a person would want to wall
[1:40:04] up their people
[1:40:05] from the blessings that god is sending
[1:40:08] form
[1:40:09] from the love tokens is what brother
[1:40:11] branham called it that is being sit down
[1:40:13] for it
[1:40:14] and yet they wall them up even if it's
[1:40:15] by no other way but constantly pointing
[1:40:18] to the fanaticism
[1:40:19] even if it's by no other way but
[1:40:21] constantly pointing out the counterfeit
[1:40:23] by constantly pointing out the emotional
[1:40:26] aspect of it as if that's a negative
[1:40:29] by constantly pointing well that's just
[1:40:31] emotion and this one here is counterfeit
[1:40:32] and this one's and what they do is they
[1:40:34] point at all these things and brick by
[1:40:36] brick by brick they caused their people
[1:40:38] to be terrified to let loose in the
[1:40:40] presence of the lord
[1:40:42] and brick by brick they're building
[1:40:44] and brick by brick they're building and
[1:40:47] cursed be the man before the lord that
[1:40:49] riseth up and buildeth that city
[1:40:53] and look where the curse lays
[1:40:55] look where the curse lays says cursed be
[1:40:57] the man before the lord that riseth up
[1:40:59] and buildeth this city jericho he shall
[1:41:01] lay the foundation thereof in his
[1:41:02] firstborn and in his youngest son where
[1:41:05] does the curse lay the curse lays on the
[1:41:07] children
[1:41:08] the curse lays on the young people
[1:41:10] he loses his children and you would
[1:41:12] think after he lost the first one he
[1:41:14] would back off and say maybe i was wrong
[1:41:16] but no his stubbornness says i'mma put
[1:41:18] another brick on
[1:41:19] and i'ma call that fanaticism and i'ma
[1:41:21] call that emotional work up and i'm
[1:41:23] gonna say don't go to those camps
[1:41:25] and he puts another brick and another
[1:41:26] child dies and another young person
[1:41:28] disappears out the door and pretty soon
[1:41:30] the pews are empty of young people
[1:41:32] there's no life in the church over there
[1:41:34] happily building and happily building
[1:41:36] and happily building in the curses on
[1:41:38] the children
[1:41:47] and they never see the supernatural
[1:41:49] operate so to them it's nothing but
[1:41:50] stories
[1:41:52] joshua knew the walls would fall because
[1:41:53] he had examples
[1:41:56] our young people don't know the walls
[1:41:57] are going to fall because they've never
[1:41:58] seen anything because they've been stuck
[1:42:01] behind a wall their entire life
[1:42:03] and told it's not safe out there
[1:42:05] don't go out there it's not safe out
[1:42:07] there
[1:42:08] all in the name of protecting my people
[1:42:12] i'm protecting them from all that
[1:42:14] i'm protecting them from all that
[1:42:16] i'm protecting my people from
[1:42:18] pentecostalism
[1:42:20] i'm building these walls and all you're
[1:42:21] doing is killing the new birth
[1:42:24] all you're doing is killing their
[1:42:25] opportunity out of revival you're
[1:42:27] killing homes
[1:42:28] you're making sure there's no births
[1:42:31] you're no different than pharaoh
[1:42:36] lording over the people
[1:42:39] protecting the
[1:42:40] people because it's not the season for
[1:42:43] the supernatural we wouldn't want you to
[1:42:44] get led astray
[1:42:47] the berlin wall couldn't make it through
[1:42:49] a whole one without a little history
[1:42:55] modern history's most infamous wall
[1:42:57] erected in 1961
[1:42:59] when the soviets aligned east german
[1:43:01] government when the soviet line east
[1:43:02] german government built a series of
[1:43:04] concrete partitions separating east and
[1:43:06] west berlin
[1:43:07] while communist leaders claimed the
[1:43:09] barriers were designed to keep out the
[1:43:11] fascists
[1:43:12] and enemies of the state this is for
[1:43:15] your protection
[1:43:17] we're doing this for you
[1:43:21] their real function was to prevent the
[1:43:23] east germans from defecting to the west
[1:43:28] for 28 years it stood as the symbol of
[1:43:30] division that's what these walls are
[1:43:32] division
[1:43:34] symbols of division of europe and the
[1:43:36] world of communist suppression
[1:43:42] the xenophobia of a regime that had to
[1:43:45] lock its people in lest they be tempted
[1:43:47] by a freer life
[1:43:54] do message believers build that wall
[1:43:59] mix the mortar
[1:44:04] east german propagandists
[1:44:07] had spent decades trying to convince the
[1:44:09] world
[1:44:10] that this wall was an instrument of
[1:44:12] freedom
[1:44:15] referring to the berlin wall as an
[1:44:17] anti-fascist protective rampart
[1:44:20] officials claim the wall was necessary
[1:44:23] to protect citizens of the german
[1:44:25] democratic republic from the
[1:44:27] exploitation and oppression inherent in
[1:44:30] the west
[1:44:32] it's for your freedom
[1:44:34] this is for your freedom
[1:44:36] i don't i understand that when you've
[1:44:37] been beat down and told something for so
[1:44:39] long you begin to believe it but from
[1:44:41] the outside i'm like do you think i'm
[1:44:43] stupid
[1:44:45] this is for my freedom
[1:44:47] sit down be quiet hush
[1:44:51] don't shout because my wall might fall
[1:44:53] down
[1:44:55] why don't they want you shouting because
[1:44:56] they built walls
[1:44:59] they need their walls to stay up
[1:45:01] they need their walls stayed in this is
[1:45:03] for your protection
[1:45:05] this is for your freedom
[1:45:08] listen you think when those walls came
[1:45:09] down and rahab was free don't tell her
[1:45:12] to go back in jericho for her protection
[1:45:14] rahab what are you doing get back in
[1:45:16] there
[1:45:17] uh-uh
[1:45:19] no
[1:45:20] she was free now
[1:45:21] don't go telling her it's time to return
[1:45:23] behind those walls that is for her
[1:45:25] safety or that it's for her freedom
[1:45:28] listen i want to add my voice to a now
[1:45:30] deceased former president of the united
[1:45:32] states ronald reagan and i'll add my
[1:45:34] voice to the world wide web
[1:45:37] and i'll say preachers of this message
[1:45:38] and congregations of this message tear
[1:45:41] down those walls
[1:45:43] i say tear them down walls of oppression
[1:45:46] walls keeping your people chained walls
[1:45:48] not letting your people be free not
[1:45:50] letting the spirit operate tear down
[1:45:52] those walls
[1:45:53] tear them down
[1:45:55] god's people are dying to carry out
[1:45:57] walls god's ministers are ordained to
[1:45:59] tear down walls
[1:46:01] to bring freedom to the people to bring
[1:46:03] liberty to the people
[1:46:08] to get a people ready to rapture
[1:46:11] to build up their faith
[1:46:13] to see that god is the same yesterday
[1:46:15] today and forever not because i told you
[1:46:17] so because you see him operating in your
[1:46:20] midst from this side of the church to
[1:46:22] that side of the church these walls are
[1:46:24] cursed walls and they must fall in the
[1:46:27] name of jesus christ
[1:46:36] if you'll give me one minute i am
[1:46:38] closing this service
[1:46:42] those walls are not for their safety
[1:46:44] those walls are to keep people bound
[1:46:47] those walls keep people from their
[1:46:48] promise
[1:46:50] and the thing is they've got them walled
[1:46:52] inside a wall inside a wall
[1:46:54] what do you mean by that well they're
[1:46:55] facing issues and they're under attack
[1:46:57] that the power of god could easily tear
[1:47:00] down
[1:47:01] but because they're walled off from that
[1:47:02] they can't use the power of god
[1:47:05] to attack
[1:47:06] that they're walled inside a wall inside
[1:47:09] a wall
[1:47:12] walls that could come down and so now
[1:47:14] they're used to depression
[1:47:16] now they're used to not being able to
[1:47:17] overcome they've been walled off for so
[1:47:20] long they think it's normal it's not
[1:47:22] normal
[1:47:23] it's not what you have to be
[1:47:25] that wall in your life must fall
[1:47:29] you are ordained and called to tear down
[1:47:32] walls

[1:50:34] class the other day i was showing my
[1:50:36] class the prince of egypt
[1:50:39] yeah it was awesome
[1:50:41] i'd pause like every five minutes you
[1:50:43] know what that means that blood right
[1:50:44] there represented how you can be saved
[1:50:46] by the blood of jesus they're like oh
[1:50:48] really you play
[1:50:54] i was pausing it constantly the first
[1:50:56] time i ever preached to my kids before
[1:50:59] it's okay they loved it
[1:51:03] lydia was texting me i don't remember
[1:51:04] the exact thing
[1:51:07] she was telling me about some desperate
[1:51:09] situations
[1:51:10] people fighting desperate battles people
[1:51:12] that need god
[1:51:14] it may not mean nothing to you
[1:51:16] it's okay
[1:51:17] meant a lot to me she sends me this text
[1:51:19] and i'm reading i'm like god
[1:51:20] we need you
[1:51:22] i'm sitting there and
[1:51:24] it's a cartoon i know
[1:51:27] but the people are walking out of egypt
[1:51:29] and she texts me that and i'm reading it
[1:51:30] and all of a sudden they break into this
[1:51:31] song

[1:51:35] if you believe
[1:51:36] there will be miracles

[1:52:02] we're going to keep going forward with
[1:52:03] the supernatural faith in god we may be
[1:52:06] facing walls tonight but even like
[1:52:07] tabernacle i ain't backing up
[1:52:09] we ain't backing up because once again
[1:52:11] there's a people standing there staring
[1:52:13] at the walls of jericho
[1:52:16] and we're not worried we know we're
[1:52:18] going to attack
[1:52:19] and we know we're going to win
[1:52:21] we may not know exactly how but suddenly
[1:52:24] there's a man standing there
[1:52:27] suddenly there's a man standing there
[1:52:30] and maybe 40 years ago they didn't do it
[1:52:32] and maybe daddy didn't do it maybe
[1:52:33] somebody in your family didn't do it but
[1:52:35] here you are standing there looking at
[1:52:36] that wall
[1:52:38] with an opportunity
[1:52:40] to make it all right
[1:52:43] it's time now to tear down walls
[1:52:45] it's time now to go on the attack it's
[1:52:48] time now to take the promise
[1:52:52] walls
[1:52:53] must fall
[1:52:56] what are you saying i'm saying cancer is
[1:52:58] defeated
[1:53:00] i'm saying diabetes is defeated
[1:53:03] i'm saying barrenness is defeated

[1:53:12] he says harlot ray have she hid them
[1:53:14] under this blacks on top of her roof
[1:53:15] sent the men out of the gates and come
[1:53:17] back and said look
[1:53:19] now watch how gods are moving to take
[1:53:22] this encouragement back to joshua

[1:53:29] say we have heard the lord has done for
[1:53:31] you amen i just love that don't you
[1:53:33] worry
[1:53:34] god's got a good time coming by and by
[1:53:37] and all the country is afraid of you
[1:53:40] when we heard that the lord dried up the
[1:53:42] red sea and let you cross drown
[1:53:44] pharaoh's army give you food by man out
[1:53:46] in the wilderness put a brass serpent up
[1:53:48] for an atonement he'd done all those
[1:53:50] things for you and i know what you've
[1:53:52] done destroyed the og and the other
[1:53:54] kings i've seen what you did utterly
[1:53:56] destroyed and when he heard this
[1:53:59] and you were headed our way we just
[1:54:01] fainted
[1:54:02] there's no more courage left to know
[1:54:04] when i tell you tonight there's no more
[1:54:05] courage left in hell

[1:54:09] seen what you've done he's seen cancer
[1:54:10] defeated he's seen sin cast out he's
[1:54:13] seen people filled with the holy ghost
[1:54:15] he says tonight i know
[1:54:17] i know what god has done for you
[1:54:20] and there's no more courage left in hell
[1:54:22] tonight
[1:54:24] when they come back and told that to
[1:54:26] joshua i can imagine he whirled that
[1:54:28] sword said glory to god he's before us
[1:54:31] amen
[1:54:33] what made them faint what made them so
[1:54:35] fanny when they were bigger
[1:54:37] why he said we look like grasshoppers up
[1:54:39] beside them how could they faint
[1:54:41] they were sitting behind big walls with

[1:54:45] spears
[1:54:46] and everything
[1:54:47] outnumbered them by the thousands times
[1:54:49] thousands and thousands certainly they
[1:54:51] could they were all united together

[1:54:56] little handful of little bitty old tiny
[1:54:59] scrubby looking men with old sickle bars
[1:55:01] and things to flight why can't we do it

[1:55:07] they ain't even military men at all
[1:55:09] the only thing they are walking along
[1:55:11] with little old sandals on they're not
[1:55:12] warriors they're campers and dwellers
[1:55:15] and fanatics and holy rollers there i am

[1:55:20] standing down on the banks and shouting
[1:55:21] and screaming and bringing a disgrace
[1:55:23] there i am again

[1:55:28] against them

[1:55:30] hearts why god said i'll send my fear
[1:55:33] before you amen there it is i'll send my
[1:55:36] fear before for you're my people
