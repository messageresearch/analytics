bypass she uh she i don't know all the medical terms but she has significant amount of swelling in her abdomen and we're just praying that the bypass provides the blood flow flow needed to her abdomen abdomen so we will be having another surgery today and tomorrow to perform another bypass so she's been through surgeries going through more and just asking for prayer also brother kelly hildebrand pastor there in saskatchewan request prayer for his grandson isaac uh he's been sick this real sick young man he's only 12 years old and sick nearly all of his life and he's if you look at him you wouldn't think he was 12 because he's real small and petite because of his sickness but they're doing a colonoscopy and and other procedures as well on this next coming wednesday doctors are saying they need to take the colon completely out and put the bag on the outside and that'd be a lifetime thing and so we're just asking the lord to intervene on his behalf i believe he's that kind of god i know he's a healer i know him to be a healer and he's not just a healer he's also a creator and he i've seen him create new hearts and new livers and you know uh just thinking of a testimony at brother wendell martens of a of a lady that had come out of the world and her liver was shot because of all the things she had done and the drugs or whatever she'd done and just killed her liver and a drinking but in her salvation god gave her a new liver well i believe he's still that same god today if if any of you would meet isaac you would love him instantly he's just a real loving young boy even through all that he's went through and she has a lot of love to give and to show so my heart really goes out to him today and just ask the lord to come on the scene for his behalf how many would have a knee just sort of make it known to the lord that's brother aaron if he'd come and just open our service this morning let's pray together and believe for these things [Music] amen let's go

to hearts and lives to each person lord that is here i pray that you'll minister to them in a very very special way in jesus name amen and amen god bless you amen before you have your seats we're going to look at the word of god if you'll turn with me to genesis 18 i'm going to read down through the eighth verse and then we will have just a couple of announcements and go forward today genesis genesis 18 and verse 1 and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent door of in the heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and loved three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my lord if i have now found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye uh your hearts after that you shall pass on for therefore are you come to your servant and they said so do as thou hast said and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal kneaded and make cakes upon the heart and abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a can a calf tender and good and gave it unto the young man and he hastened to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat amen god bless you we're going to let you have your seats amen we want to welcome today the um jackson burns family jackson and laura and their children that are here um zoe and silas we all stand the burns family just all stand and just so everybody know who they are all right there's there they are from the east to the west we're all together amen so we're really happy to have you come and so join with us in this part of life's journey thank you amen they have just recently moved here and i know they're going to be sorely missed back home and they loved it there but they feel the lord has led them uh to come and to be a part with us and so we want them just to feel welcome to feel apart amen i want to show you a little um picture today a little thing that sister rebecca paris gifted me the other day with and we're going to be hanging it in the foyer for you to see and as you can see it's a it's a great oak tree and this is what i've been telling you evening light tabernacle this is what we are we're an oak tree one time we were just a little seedling a little acorn you know and sometimes when god gives a promise to you that's what he does he just gives you an acre you ask for an oak tree he gives you an acre and it's under your care and you water it and and believe for it and and it grows into a mighty tree well under a tree like this you know the birds come and enjoy the branches and people come and sit under it and enjoy the shade from the heat of the day and and this is what we want to be at evening light tabernacle today there are people joining in with us from all over the world and will be a part with us in this service today and in the service today we we have visitors among us from texas and oklahoma and north carolina and and um arizona so we got you know just a little smattering of gathering from here and there but they've all come to rest under our tree today and we want you to feel welcome and be feel that you're a part with us this is what we aspire to be here at evening light tabernacle is as an oak tree and someone that that the weary the the sick the needy the lost can come and find refuge amen so thank you sister rebecca for this it's a it's a great treasure to me thank you very much god bless you amen isn't god good to us he gives us so many blessings and today we're going to be looking into the scripture if you notice i didn't read about el shaddai this morning i i've taken now into the next chapter because there is so much in here that is prophecy of the last day and so we're going to be looking into certain aspects of the scripture and the promises that abound for this end time par a part of our journey and of course the the churches has been traveling the old testament church was started in genesis and they were types and shadows and were pointing toward our day and then it would come into the new covenant in the new testament and so since the uh if he's in age the church has traveled and now has grown and i believe that we today as a as a body of christ around the world we should be a mighty oak tree starting on the day of pentecost from from an acorn that was planted and now its branches should be reaching up a man that's the tree of life we look around and we see the tree of knowledge and good of good and evil has reached its height well the bride tree ought to also be reaching its height in this day and hour now of course um as we read about abraham we're going to be speaking about the visitation and that's what the part we're going to be looking at this morning because as you know there had been visitations before to abraham one was el shaddai that we spoke about the others were other appearings that he had made but here abraham is representing his seed and he's representing the seed of abraham today remember when we look at the bible we're not looking at that at it as just a historical book we're looking at it as a prophecy and we begin to realize that we are the interpretation of that prophecy amen one time it was tongues now it is interpretation you say why tongues it was symbolic it was written in mysteries it was a hidden truth but in this day and hour is no longer a mystery or hidden truth but now it has been revealed been made known to us so you see um when when we see abraham representing his seed i don't want you to think of it as one man but seed meaning the seed of christ the multi-member body you say well i see one man there whose name was uh had with seven letters and ended in 8 a.m and you know like abraham but and yes but this represents all of the elect you see abraham's seed to whom has been made heir of all things and if it was just to brother branham h.a.m you so then then we might as well just close our bible and go home because it all got fulfilled in him but it doesn't it's about a bride and it's about a visitation to the seed of abraham in this last day and brother branham only just happened to be one of the members of that seed of abraham or that body of christ so you see but this is the apex if you're reading in genesis this would be the apex of all the visitations of god the summit the capstone the highest point of all the appearings and it concludes with the coming of the promised son so now this is the day that we're living in we are not living in a parcel revealing or a partial appearing or uh uh just a a little portion given but now we are at the apex of the summit we have reached the capstone the highest point of all the appearings of god and it concludes with the coming back of jesus christ who is the head of the body and head of all things so this with even to abraham would be the last appearing of god to abraham until the ultimate test when when isaac was a young man and he would type out calvary but that's a whole set of different types as i've said about types you've got to know where to begin them and where to end them so let's just talk about this for a minute when we we realized that the types now will end in this part of the types will end with this summit this climax of this appearing and the coming sun all right now again you know that it it will then again we'll have another type a little later of calvary and where that isaac the promised son is taken up to up on top of the heel of moriah and there he is to be offered and a lamb is put in his place but see that's a different type now if you if you'd if you run those types together let me explain about this for a minute if you ex if you run those types together then you will have after the coming sun after the change of the body after the rapture the hardest test ever which would be the offering of the sun right so it has to end here with this climax and the other is a separate type amen so abraham does type the bribe but after the rapture we're not going to have a hardest test amen we're going to enjoy a millennial amen we're going to enjoy new heavens and a new earth testing is over when our bodies are changed so you've got to run types in continuity and know when they begin and where they end all right so now this was the greatest of all appearance and he had appeared already as a shady eye the pouring out of the holy ghost but now this pouring out of the holy ghost it crescendos into god manifest in human flesh amen and this would be the capping off of all of the visitations of elohim god had led him from the era of the chaldeans appearing in the land of his fathers and and this would cause abram the idol worshiper to start seeking a city whose builder and maker was god but you see in all of the visitations from the age of 75 whether it was by voice or by dream or by visions of elohim this now was the greatest for now god was manifest in the flesh here god comes walking in a fleshly body and so this manifestation was more real more physical for here it was like the fullness of all the manifestations of the divine presence when the word was made flesh in jesus christ now and so let me say that the appearance of god in this last day is once again a culmination of all the appearings of god we can look back and see mighty revivals and mighty appearings and he appears to luther and he appeared to wesley and he appeared on azusa street but this is now the highest point the culmination among the summit of all the appearance and you are part of that appearing in this last day where god is appearing to you amen and it's not a mere baptism of the holy ghost but rather a capping off of the pouring out of the entire deity of god into his bride body hallelujah now this was happening in abraham's group amen think of it brother timothy preached it wednesday night there is a man here a man present who can turn on the light no matter how dark it is no matter how many troubles there is he's not just coming he's here there's a man present here that can flip the switch anytime amen i'll tell you what if you were sick this morning you should be looking for him to flip the switch for you amen if you're lost this morning there's a man here who can turn on the light for you amen that can lift you up in the heavenly places now so there's a man here notice king theophany was appearing think of it king theophany a visible manifestation of god to humankind in this last day he's actually showed himself visible he's even allowed his picture to be taken of that supernatural being where you can even well you could even see it there it wasn't psychology light struck the lens hey amen there was actually a light hundreds saw the angel of god in 1946 right over here in camden arkansas just north of here here uh you know there was there was a brother adams that had brother branham to preach for him in the early days of his ministry at camden and he began to try to tell the crowd about the pillar of fire and the angel that had appeared how it was allied and how that there was a signed gift in his hand and of course you know they were just filled with unbelief they had never seen nothing like this never heard of a man who had an angel appear and frankly they were very skeptical but about that time from the back here it come the pillar of fire right down the aisle and as it did there was a crippled man in the aisle in a wheelchair and out of that chair he came as it passed over him and it come right up and reverend adams looked up and screamed out i see it i see it and it blinded him and down into the seat he went knocking him down oh no we don't believe in falling out today in the spirit but it happened with reverend adams when he saw the pillar of fire wasn't the devil either it was a pillar of fire amen now this was witnessed by hundreds it was hundreds actually saw the angel of god a manifestation of the supernatural and what does this show us king theophany is here among us amen about to bring all the theophanies from glory and they're going to step back in the flesh i hope you don't miss that and i hope you understood what i said king theophany is here amen and he he's come from from and he's going to bring with him the other theophanies and they will step right back in the flesh like sister karen and brother jerome and the other saints brother jerry shaw they're not dead they just stepped into their theophanies and they're about to step back in the flesh amen because of the appearing of king theophany appearing in the last days hallelujah the visit the visitation of the pillar of fire now in this appearing to abraham three theophanies stepped into bodies gathered then from the elements of the earth the the different the different parts brother branham would call it 16 elements cosmic lights and pot ass and calcium and whatever he gray he grabbed it together and it came and appeared to abraham i want you just to understand this supernatural god is the god able to gather the potters the clay the cosmic lights what once made up bodies of the saints and gather them back and theophany step in it that's going to happen the end disappearing are you with me now god's showing us in types and shadows here that theophanies are about to enter into view and when we see them we're going to be changed and receive christ the promised son and be translated to meet him in the air now brother branham visualized it like this he said i the only thing god did he said you tell me that down in sodom and gomorrah is getting very sinful and it's about time to show an example of what we're going to do in the world in the end time so here he comes and appears to abraham and and as he as he's coming he says you know the sin of sodom has reached to heaven you think it's just reaching your ears do you think it's just grieving you no it's grieving the heart of almighty god amen and it's causing him to come down brother branham called it an investigating judgment where god himself is investigating what is going on in america down in south africa over in asia and around the world where sodom is not a country or a city but sodom is a world condition i know i know you know america's going to burn by the time it's sodom the world's going to burn it's sodom i don't know if you've noticed but it's sodom out there it's sodom in your schools it's sodom in your neighborhood it's sodom and the world around you it's sodom on your jobs it's sodom everywhere and god said i've taken notice of it he did it in the days of noah before the destruction he's doing it now in this day amen and he's about to show an example that's what he was doing back there about to show an example of what he was going to do at the end time a burner with fire and brimstone and so he he calls over brother branham's used examples and he now these aren't true these aren't hard and and true facts right here of michael and gabriel because other times he'll use wormwood or one of the other angels so it's it's not these are not hard rules here these are examples he's he's typing it out he said come here gabriel and come here michael and he says step into that body just blows in step into that body and he pulls cosmic light and everything together now step into that body and then he made one for himself and when he was here he hungered like a man and he ate like a man and he vanished in the air in the presence of abraham and then went back to god again [Music] now brother adam said god is like a great contractor he laid our bodies out here on the earth element needed to make our body he laid it out when he created the world i want just to say this to you your body was god's first and it was never intended for satan to dwell in amen that's why we got it right when sickness comes to say get out of here satan leave my body hallelujah because my body was there made by almighty god created and all of the elements was put right here on the earth to be gathered together for my time on the earth and get it ready for a theophany to come to since i did bypass mine now so he says he says now what am i made of petroleum and potash and calcium my body was laying on the earth well before there was anything that at all ever on the earth and when the holy spirit went forth before god to brood over the earth uh like like a a brood means to coo like a dove or a hidden mother and there was nothing but volcanic eruptions that god moved this old star around the sun and began making potassium calcium he's like a great contractor laying out his number to build his house and our bodies were on the earth right then hallelujah amen i'm going to show you in a minute your body will never be annihilated either amen your body will be something that you will dwell in in eternity's ahead the only thing it won't be mortal it'll be immortal glorified hallelujah he said you're going to call me a holy roller anyhow you might as well get started right now i wonder what when the last time you got called a holy roller it's about time you get excited about the word like brother branham did have the right response to the promise of god hey man he said that i make a holy roller out of you well i'll tell you that'll make a holy roller out of you what about the lamb taking the book and opening the seals hallelujah what about showing you your name was on the book of life the lamb's book of life but for the foundational world that i make a holy roller out of you [Applause] when he sent the holy spirit forth said brood over the earth he began to coo and the verse staying a little potass and little calcium run together and a little easter lily stuck up his head and he said that's beautiful and he just kept cooing and out of the ground come birds and out of there come trees and the animals and so forth and then came up man in the image of god yes then man sin and it brought along this sexual affair that we have now but god's still using his material and he will raise it up again at the last day he don't give up on us does he amen god cannot be defeated oh i love that amen here the enemy comes with his attack against you wars on your mind wars against your body wars of unbelief but god cannot be defeated this same holy ghost that crewed over the earth and brought up and many easter lilies and flowers and trees and animals and humans that same holy ghost has been brooding over your part of humanity that part of cosmic light that part of just hallelujah that's why you're here this morning because why he's cooing over you amen he's pulling you to his image i called you before the foundation of the world so he crews over you he coos over and he says i am the lord that forgiveth all of thine iniquities i am the one that comes to live in you amen me lord me this o wretched sinful ah while these hands used to do they used to smoke bring tobacco up to my mouth this mine used to do this this this the way i used to live this old piece of humanity this dust of the earth god didn't give up on you hallelujah when he saved your soul that was a deposit for the redemption of your body hallelujah and he's going to make your body obey the word of god your body that you serve sin your body that used to follow the works of the devil your body hallelujah he's transforming it by transforming power hallelujah you say i ain't what i ought to be he's still working on you he's still cooing he's still calling hallelujah he's cooing to you this morning i'll forgive you of all your iniquities i'll heal you of all your diseases i'm the one that wants to come and live in you me lord and your dust answers me why me lord forget the why i just accept it [Applause] amen people want to question why me why me because he chose it [Applause] you can't explain why you didn't do nothing you didn't do anything to deserve it hallelujah but he had you in his mind before the world never began and he can never ever unchoose you [Applause] that'll make a holy roller out of you [Applause] hallelujah i called you before the foundational world i want to come to you and raise you up at the last day and give you eternal life yeah lord come on and the holy ghost comes in and says grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed how long until when the day my body's changed oh you say brother tim i live in this old wretched body and it's got a mind and this mind has evil thoughts and and i tell you there's there's problems and i got passions and things in this light in this body this whole body it ain't saved but where is salvation is down on the inside of the inside and it makes your body obey the word of god [Applause] of course when you would do when you would do right evil as present you got the flesh for him to anoint it's not redeemed but you got a soul that's redeemed and greater is he that is in me than those thoughts that are bothering me hallelujah greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world amen i'm an overcomer that means i wrestle with and fight it out amen you see we still have temptations we still have our trials jesus would get so close he would smell the the old foul breath of the that old serpent called the devil lucifer amen he would get so weak after it that angels would come and strengthen him what will the devil do to you when he comes you need strengthening amen angels appeared that's what appearing so far to give strength that's why we want another appearance in this church this morning amen the holy ghost comes so then and he seals us to the day of redemption so what are you scared about what is there to fear the devil may knock come on but he can't get in hey man he's sealed out hallelujah fort seal god's like a big contractor he lays out his material on the earth and begins building his material remember there's a grain of seed before there was a grain of seed on the earth before there was a sun ever struck the earth your body was laying on the earth because you were dust to the earth you are and god is the contractor now the way he was going to do it was reach down now here's how he's going to bring man from you said well brother tim if he didn't bring us through the womb of a woman and through sex desire then how he's going to do it the way he was going to do it was reach down and get like he did adam a little bunch of calcium and potash and cosmic light and blow into it there's my other son and he would bring up some more and amen there's another one but what did eve do she corrupted that way and she brought it to his sexual act and then that struck it now what is god doing he's got so many of those seeds down through there that's predestinated so much that is pre uh the predestinated and then at the end time and here we are are we in time he won't say eve come bear another child he will and call and i'll answer that's the idea and when the last one comes in that settles it hallelujah do you remember when he got ahold of your dust collected your dust and breathed the breath of life into you the baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah and your soul became alive but that's what he's doing he's gathering dust we got dust here from louisiana and mississippi and oklahoma and texas and arizona and idaho and iowa and here and there whatever i don't know where all you're from just a little pile of dust that god so loved that he'll never give up on you hallelujah that he'll never stop loving you hallelujah amen now now brother branham said if that's the kind of god we're serving if that's the omnipotence remember i preached on omnipotence we're serving didn't we go out what have we got to worry about sickness death or sorrow or corruption or whatever more one of these days all of these old atoms that's holding these bodies together is going to break away and we're going back to dust and the lights going back and all the other parts of earth is going back to its place but at the resurrection he will and you'll step into it hallelujah this is what he did at this appearing to abraham that's what he's going to do amen in disappearing in this last day i didn't showed you where he collected your dust spiritually and breathe life into it then how much more will he also complete the work of redemption [Applause] and call the elements of your body back together again no matter how decayed it is let me tell you friends you can't lose you cannot lose this god has made it he will not be defeated and you can't lose amen the winds of the holy spirit that you feel today blowing through this church it will blow in such a way in such a way that dust from the earth will rise and form bodies not all wrinkled ones no not ones with rotten hands come on not decayed bodies but uh that earth will rise and warm bodies and theophanies will step into them and we will embrace and to you talk about appearing they will appear to us and then that same baptism of the holy spirit will blow over our mortal bodies and our dust will be glorified in a moment and a twinkling of an eye so glorified so immortal they'll pass right through walls amen transcends dimension and travel like a thought and meet him in the air i say hallelujah while brother branham told us this he said you see these little pockets going through the air they call saucers they're little lights he said well we better leave that alone but you hear all these people coming up missing you see don't hear from them they're standing there and they're not there well that's the way the rapture is going to be now you know some of what they've come up with may not be true but this is true this part is true that's the way the rapture is going to be one of them will drop right down and this terrestrial body will take on a celestial body and there'll be hide hair or bones left it'll be transformed in a moment of time dropping right out of space and taking home that we see all of this going on the pentagon wondering about these lights and mystic lights and everything they're seeing in the sky you see they had one in the paper jeffersonville this week and so on a mystic light and so oh they don't know what that is but listen little children is going to pick you up one of these days hallelujah there is a light of theophanic light a theophanic appearance that's going to come to your mortal body and quicken it you see you see why we're in the climax you see why this is the summit you see this is at the end of the ages this is the last visitation of god what happened before sodom god came down with some angels and had an investigating judgment said i heard the cry it's so sinful it's so great i'll come to find out whether it's all together true or not amen you know you don't have to watch the news god already seen it that's one you can't do nothing about it anyway so why are you all worried about what's going on in the world amen god's seen it and he's come down amen amen what's but that main one stayed with abraham did you hear that the main one state amen amen the main one stayed with abraham could discern the thoughts it was in sarah's heart behind him and you look around a little bit and notice what's going on it's the same thing it's an investigating judgment why after the world after a while the church when it can stay in that place and every predestinated seed is brought to its spot they'll be gone and they won't know what happened to them one of them be going this way and another will be going to the pastor's house and one will be going on down here or down there and the first thing you know they're not there for evict was a type god took him and he was not found come down to investigate now what is he looking for when he's looking for you what is he looking for jesus told us what he would be looking for when the son of man cometh will i find faith this is what he's going to be looking for amen that's what these appearance now are for to turn your heart back to believing again now the continuity how the the inner translation and type of israel being carried over the ark that's noah and of course lot the which represents the the saved church not the bride but notice all of these are in the types they're all prophesied to be in the last day amen you know somebody asked me the other day are the foolish virgins among the bride in the message churches are fully are there foolish virgins i said well if they are they're very foolish it would be foolish to turn down the moving of the holy ghost the opportunity to be baptized with the spirit to be ignited with this fire it would be foolish to turn down the revelation of god in this hour but sometimes i wonder there's a part of me that just ponders maybe you know too much to be a foolish virgin i'll leave that with you i'll tell you what i wouldn't try to make it in by the skin of my teeth amen you said brother tim you know you're going to preach you're going to preach and it's going to produce the bride and and there be the church well i'll tell you what with all this within me ever since i've been a young boy i preached i preached for a bride calling not just be a church the last thing i want for you other than being lost forever is to be a tribulation saint amen i i don't want you to have to go through that time i'm not sure don't you wait and stay standing at the white throne judgment amen i i don't want to review that you you sat in services like this and you heard the word of god preached and the spirit of god moved and you watch it all back and you sat like a bump on the log you didn't make any response you continued being foolish you see brother branham talked about this and and let me just read some more he says he's god you fail to see who he is he's the unchanging god i'm glad i got faith in him tonight that someday when my life when my body with his 16 elements will be back in the dusty earth now that's true and he will say but he will say william branham and i'll come forth he'll breathe the breath of life into it and say there you are he will bypass the birth through my mother and so forth like jesus on his first miracle he turned the water into wine eventually it would have been wine that water would have been wine it would have come up through the grapevine and come up through it and through the blossoms and made fruit and would have wound up in the grapes and would have been squeezed out and fermented and made wine amen but you see he bypassed the whole process he shows he's a god that can bypass the whole process hallelujah and in one instance water turned the wine take this water and bear it to the governor of the feast and when he tasted it it was no more water it was wine one instant at the resurrection hallelujah he's going to bypass the womb the nine months of pregnancy the baby and the toddler and the adolescent stage he won't say hey mr mrs pruitt get married again and bring forth tim he will speak and i'll come forth he'll speak and you'll come forth amen he's god as he said in marriage in divorce hallelujah there will come a time where it won't be no more sex but god will call his children from the dust of the earth back like they were in the original not through any woman but through the molding of the clay and the cosmic lights and the petroleum he'll create again like he did adam at the first time that's what happens in this appearing this is what he will do he will appear look who is the bride anyway she's christ she's christ in what form bright form is that right he's going to appear in theophanic form you see he's got a physical body we're going to meet that in the air but he's going to appear in our day in his bride emptionic form and he will pick up dust from the earth and step into it and those who are alive and remain to the coming lord will be standing there with their dust their guts that just had an evil thought that just heard bad news that this heard a doctor's report come on somebody amen people must guess and the holy spirit will sweep over them and in a moment he will bypass your mother and your father and he will make you all over anew glorify your body a theophany will step in and glorify your body in a moment in a twinkling of an eye now see our bodies are not annihilated this is a whole thing on future home brother branham taught us that the the the the earth will not be annihilated as well if heavens and earth will pass away he said it's changed from one form to another it's not an annihilation meaning disintegrates into nothingness it can never be nothing again god has used this earth to type it as his wife the son as himself the earth is his wife who who his life is reproduced on is that right amen and he made this earth for a purpose and he came and said and he he already has baptized it with water he has shed his blood upon it and he's about to baptize it with fire and come and live on it so brother branham would tell us you know he is not going to annihilate the earth and let me say your bodies will not be annihilated and this it will be a resurrection not a replacement oh brother tim it won't be a bunch of men going down with spades and opening up the grave no it won't it'll be theophanies coming and gathering up what they left behind and transforming it in a moment in a twinkling of an eye the same body that went down that went down into the grave will come up all you have to do is listen to the prophet you'll get rid of some of all these dumb ideas that god ain't interested in your body and we you know he it was something we said the whole earth was something we that was sin then amen but he told us that it's not it is not a a replacement you know if i go over here and i take this bible and i put it down and i pick up this box of kleenex you see that's not a resurrection that's a replacement well you got this new body brother tim you got this new body and it's one that listen the one he glorifies will be one that never sinned then but resurrection is not a replacement it is a picking up of the same body that went down because god will not annihilate your body that's why god is concerned about your flesh that's why he provided healing for your body and he's interested in you and your need this morning and has already provided the antidote for sin and the antidote for sickness so that by his stripes you can be healed i say hallelujah that's the kind of god that i serve your body's not annihilated it's not done away with your body instead is the temple of the holy ghost that's why we got a right to say satan take your hands off of god's property god's property why is it god's property you say it's still mortal brother tim it ain't converted yet brother tim it's god's property he has already put a down payment on it by the redemption of your soul and he's going to redeem your body jehovah jiren brother branham says it this way he says amen glory not one hair of your head will perish hallelujah that's exactly right it was not yet it is in a way and yet it is not then it is exactly petroleum cosmic lights calcium pottish now he's referring back to those angels they were not then they were amen they were not there were no bodies there they were all of a sudden here they are they appear they appear and as they appear you know they come for a visitation and while they're visiting they they give revelation and understanding and knowledge and the promise and then in a moment disappear and the petroleum calcium potash cosmic lights all go right back to the elements again and he says he says when i am nothing nothing you can see just ashes he will speak hallelujah throw in that polish and petroleum together and i'll live again in his presence hallelujah that he gives us eternal life and all the father has given me there's nothing as lost and i'll raise it up at the last days i believe it as a seed of abraham i'm look for that day i'm searching for a city whose builder and maker is god certainly no matter how this wrinkles up and no matter what happens god will raise it up again in the splendor of youth again at the last day he promised he would do it and i'm looking for that city amen he said i feel so religious right now knowing that blessed hope waiting for me there i'm looking for that city my heart is beating toward it oh not one way would i turn but look straight toward that place god help me to stay right there true and faithful throwing out a lifeline everywhere bringing every weary pilgrim i can to go along yes i had a vision of it not long ago and i've seen it see my loved ones there back young again aren't you glad he did he said his dear friends he said it's there i know it's there you probably read it in the christian business men's voice and many magazines and things packed it friends that wasn't a vision i've seen visions i know i ought to know what to have but about tens of thousands that he's given me but this wasn't a vision i was there standing right there looking back amen and i know it's there it's their friends it's there i know it's there yes sir just as soon as i'm standing here so help me if i got my right mind and standing here in this pulpit it's there aren't you glad that we've had a joshua as it were and a caleb who went over there and brought back fruit said i've been to the land and it's real the people are real i felt them i hugged them i looked at 90 years old and they were young people amen there was no feelings of sexual attraction it was all gold i hugged women there was no feeling it was real what was it he had went there and came back and brought back the report anew and afresh in our day that we are in the awakening that we are in the appearing so he would translate him there just to let us know we're in the hour of translation whoo glory oh my god mouth that ought to make you a holy roller this morning we're that close to it he said now remember he made our bodies and they have to obey him also i called you a lump of texas louisiana dust that's what you are mud you raised up i was raised out of the ground there and that's where you're going back well instead of god gathering it your mother by eating this and that and ain't no telling where you're from fruits from california sweet potatoes from mexico and ain't no telling where you're from as far as physically what makes you up hey man you just raised off the ground out there you got little 16 elements your mother gathered the dust and it was gathered around the little seed that was in there it was more than just a seed it had a predestinated eternal germ in it hallelujah amen that's why when you came to the message hallelujah where others never heard their name called you heard your name called [Applause] hallelujah i've been down in the airport before old so-and-so meets so and so it's such-and-such you know this and that you know what oh john doe you know you're to meet your party in the lounge and this and that all these announcements i walk right on down and i don't pay attention to it one bit but one day i was in the airport and i heard tim pruitt did i hear that tim pruitt your your party is late that you're picking up they will they will come at such and such times you see all of a sudden that wasn't just noise it was my message it had instructions for me hallelujah amen you see there's many that's walked around and heard the message thousands would listen to it around the world but one day he called your name he had special instructions for you cause your name was called that's what this message does for you it calls your name it gives you instructions i'm appearing to you and i'm appearing to you and i've appeared to you i'm looking at a bunch of people here who love his appearance hallelujah that like mary magdalene he appeared to her then he appeared to the eleventh and then he appeared to the road of those on a math he appeared paul said he also appeared to me after his death burial and resurrection and i want to say he appeared to me and my life has never been to save because he appeared it had an effect on my dust and it prepared my body to receive a theophany that i bypassed it put a deposit there that that theophany's coming to you visualize it any way you want to but i visualize my theophany being it's the word thought of me still being a part of him and one day when he speaks it'll materialize right before us when he calls my name don't pay any attention to these people say well the theophany was here and i shook hands with it that's a bunch of buoy psychology pretending amen don't don't think of that when that theophany comes you're going to be changed i may not know all the mechanics of it but i know about the dynamics of it because that day that i recognized the word of god was eagle food i heard from the word god spoke of me my theophany that part of us to play and i was called and ordained for this hour oh you got a little 16 elements in you a little moisture little petroleum little potassium little calcium some cosmic light and that's about what you are twisted up together and there you go dirt of louisiana that's all you are i'm reading a quote actually dirt of louisiana that's all you are but remember something made you this and the very one that made you this come to live in you that he might make you something different oh my oh how we can look upon that oh we ought to look upon that remember he promised it through this little cloud of dirt that though this little cloth go back into the this little cloth that's walking around with life and when life leads it goes right back to dust again but what did he say in his word i'll raise it up in the last days amen i raised it up he promised it and after the body has perished even after even the dust is broke out and it goes back to the gases in the earth as i said the other night you can't annihilate nothing man can't there's no annihilation man cannot annihilate anything it's only god can do it and remember he will though it be a spoonful of ashes he will say i'll raise it up again at the last day that dirt will have to obey his commandment because he created it and if the winds and the wave obey him so does the dirt obey him wake up he is with us and all obeys him even your body's going to obey him hallelujah you know you had that germ of eternal life that appearing came to you and quickened something down on the inside of you and your old mortal body was laying in bed this morning and there was something get up go to church get up hallelujah hey man you remember when it got ahold of you and drug you down to an altar amen you remember when he when he saved your soul and he glorified that soul of yours [Applause] amen you remember when that heavenly kiss came and that embrace and you was made one with him and became his bride hallelujah what was that god was making your dust obey him [Applause] do you know the holy spirit in you can discipline your mind that's thinking on all kinds of things and pull those thoughts down and make it obey the word of god and the devil says you're lost and i say jesus said i'm saved the devil said you can't make him i i say already have [Music] amen the devil says the weapons that our god is going to overtake you and i say no weapon formed against me shall prosper this is my inheritance [Applause] thus your body has to obey your confession of god's word that's why we can say satan take your hands off of god's property you see how this appeared to abraham he is king theoph and he created a body for himself two angels stepped in it why did he do it this way you see redemption by the blood of the lord jesus christ had not yet come so you see so he could not come in physical bodies i want to get this if i don't get much more but you see when he came when he came in abraham's day the blood of christ had not been shed so the blood of bulls and goats could never take away sin so god could come could not come and live in human flesh it wasn't redeemed so he couldn't come he couldn't come any other way so he created himself a body understand he came and created bodies but now i want you to get it in this appearing he still comes in bodies and i mean physical bodies but not created bodies gathered from dust and now the one with nail scarred hands come walking down our aisles and walking down no he can't do that the word binds him from coming until the meeting in the air i want you to want you to understand the word itself binds him from coming i can just stop just for a minute and just talk about that binding stop this for a minute remember when they were about they were about to break his bones on the cross amen and here they were right there and they they beat the legs of one beat the legs or the other and walked up to beat his legs and all of a sudden something stopped him the soldier got stopped there was a word in the way that said not one bone of his body would be broken so he took a spear and he speared his side because there was a word for that but there was a word that said no bone of his could be broken come on somebody help me preach now amen the same thing is true right here jesus cannot come back in the body of jesus christ and walk our aisles but he can come but he comes in the form of the holy spirit but he also comes in that form in bodies fleshly bodies human bodies redeemed bodies you see what he couldn't do back in abraham he can do now amen are you with me god can come right down into the body of his bride now you individually cannot receive him in the fullness of the godhead bodily but his bride body around the world receives him in the fullness of the godhead bodily in bright form god come and walk in the earth in redeemed flesh hallelujah i said hallelujah i want you to realize what dwells within you this morning is deity because he has come to appear in your flesh to tabernacle your body [Applause] to perform his signs to bring his word he's using my body right now to prophesy through to preach the word of god through the testimony of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy so he's standing in the pulpit prophesying to you anointing me with words to say for your edification to build up his body to instruct the bride wherever you are today there's something for you but it's not a one-man ministry and it's not the fullness in one man you know years ago they had a little doctrine went around came out of jeffersonville you can figure the fullness of the pillar of fire dwelt in brother branham that's a lie it never dwelt in brother branham not the fullness he had a lick of fire just like all of us amen he had the same holy ghost that you have not a different holy ghost the fullness of god never dwelt in brother brown and that's that deity spirit and the deity spirit wants you to deify brother branham and not recognize your position and realize that god's in you listen you see now he uses redeemed people to appear in so where is god appearing amen he's appearing in his people he's appearing in his church the bride that's where he's appearing now the appearing is not his coming 1962 brother branham hit a vein of thought you know he said the appearance not to come and he would go over and over this thing he said they're two different words well there's actually in the bible where that some of the times he says appearing and the bible does refer to his coming but he's trying to make a point here that there is a difference between the physical return of the lord and him being in that man called jesus and is appearing in the form of the holy ghost in the church and he says there are two different things and notice he he says um the appearing is not his coming he will come for he will come in a corporal body and that's going to be the capstone of all his appearing it will it will materialize in the coming of the theophanies all of them and the meeting in the air where we will meet a literal lord jesus remember remember this no matter what how we preach about his coming and his appearing remember we still look for the blessed hope of his glorious appearance where we're going to meet him in the air is that right and brother branham would say to that there is a heaven and there is a literal jesus christ there that will come in a body form to receive his church himself and no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth god said so that's what believers believe how many are believers well then if we are believers then we will believe there is a literal lord jesus christ there in the heavens that will come in a body form to receive his church to himself no matter how old the story is it's still the truth you think that story is old the one we're reading about abraham is 2 000 years older oh brother tim i don't believe that pentecostal pack of lies you realize preachers have said that i don't believe in that pentecostal pack of lies why why would we dare ever refer to the coming of the lord jesus the meeting in the areas of pentecostal pack of lies it's not a pentecostal pack of lies it's the truth as brother branham said a born again one man or woman is just as sure of the covenant of the lord jesus they're just as sure they've got the holy ghost says there is a holy ghost to be given he says in the message shalom what care what i care about what this year brings or why do you care about next year why do i care whether i live or die today i lived today or died today every word that he promised will be vindicated everyone if he's able to do it today after promising 2000 years ago if it's a hundred thousand years today jesus will return to the earth in a visible body for a church a redeemed the bride and take her out of here regardless of what people goes fashions say and go on and people wait on in total darkness and believe anything they want to but jesus christ will return again amen so there is a returning which is his coming but right now we are in his appearing he is appearing among us what's now again going and beyond the camp he says this oh how thankful we are for all of god's great blessings and may it continue to be with us unto that last trumpet blows and you know we'll be caught up together to meet the lord in the air think of it missing people they can't see you no more but you're getting together with the rest of them hallelujah amen missing people they can't see you no more but you're getting together with the rest of them once you're glorified the world will never see you again the world won't see to say the dead but you'll see them and when you see them you'll be changed to be like them and then they won't see you anymore but you know i wonder sometime and this is just me and pardon me for being human and and and having thoughts but this is my thinking but you know i i wonder sometimes if the church says their names in the book of life lamb's book of life is that right well listen when he opened this the seals what do you find he found a people a multitude with that number between the sixth and the seventh seal so they're in the book of the lamb's book of life when the lamb's book was opened he saw them there all right so here they are these are ones that are redeemed and they are redeemed they're blood washed people that were saved this site of the tribulation but let's just say let's just say that that some of them blood washed people are your loved ones let's just say that maybe they they're your fault of mind they never saw the message what brother brandon said this is why they're foolish virgins too your faults are mine they didn't see the message or in some way were blinded by false prophets and i'm just going to tell you if you don't see the message in this church it's because you've listened to false prophets you're listening to other voices but let's just say that some of your friends some of the people you good christian people that have tried to live right tried to do right and and they didn't live the fullness of this message and they they they didn't live the fullness of the bible i meant to say they didn't see the message they didn't understand why god sent a prophet they wasn't a part of the bride elect but they're part of the church they're good people sanctified people had professed christ as savior let's just say that they're there and right now they don't have the strength and what is needed to live an overcoming life as required of the bride of christ why how are they going to be able to give their life how are they going to say oh we miss it how are they even going to know they missed it amen i and this is where i come in with my own thinking and pardon me for for just talking to you as a church but what what if it was that amen that moment of your changed and you travel like a thought and you walk up to your son or daughter's house maybe you don't knock on the door you just appear where she's cooking your daughter's cooking and all of a sudden you're there and you say dorothy everything i told you is true the rapture is on and she sees you a young person and in that moment you disappear don't you know don't you know when they can't find you and you've come up missing and they saw you like they did as brother brown described come on when that would they come and appear to many hey man what if it's your young grandma a man who's young now appears to them and say grandchildren you didn't you didn't hear it all but i'm here to tell you rapture is on this rapture day and you missed it don't you think they would have something within them to give their life amen amen we missed that we missed it the message is true the rapture is taking place but oh god amen oh i have received christ i've asked him as my savior it's too late now it's too late now he that is filthy is filthy still there's no repentance this is only for those who are living in a repentant state that's why that it's important for you to get everybody that's around you all your love at least get them to the place they receive christ as their savior amen because after the bride is gone there not be another gentile saved and they won't be saved after the tribulation they're saved now and then they go into tribulation because they were foolish they didn't have the holy ghost the oil in their vessels with their lamps food for thought anyway i ain't got it figured out and i want you to take what i just said figured it out i'm just saying friends god's got a lot more grace than what you ever imagined and the story isn't closed yet and it isn't the final available and in a month or so we'll be gone i wonder what we'll be doing in that month or so listen friends the coming of the lord is the the most blessed hope of all believers and we must not allow satan to minimize god's corporal return but within at the same time we must recognize his appearing we we have a church world right now who are giving lip service to his corporal coming amen but right now he is appearing he's appearing in bright volume with signs and wonders amen with fivefold gifts of this ministry with helps and tongues and interpretation and prophecy and working on miracles of faith and word of knowledge and wisdom many don't recognize him because they don't believe he's alive they have no expectation they have no expectation of they have no expectation of of him coming in this evil day and him and appearing have no expectation of a resurrected christ of a living god they're they're there in the heat of the day laid back in the tents hoping america will change hoping their voice their vote will make things better but the bride of christ is there in the door of the tent and they're watching for the appearing of the supernatural are you with me amen and i want you to understand you must recognize him in the form that he's appearing in remember brother adam said two words before i leave you remember these two words for i leave you the appearance of christ the coming of christ is two different things christ is appearing in the fullness of his power watch how he's appearing on the fullness of his power amen his coming will be afterwards his appearing before his coming so now he is a coming in the fullness of his power now watch i want to i want to capitalize on this quotation it comes from the sermon from that time from spokane washington 1962 june july the 13th right about this time today's 17. civilization and civilization has come from the east followed the sun west is that right it's at the west coast now it may if it makes another moves it's back east again i'd like to preach on that when east and west meets notice the s-u-n draw dawns in the east travels across the horizon sets in the west the same sun that rises in the east sets in the west is that right now he's trying to use an illustration here he's telling you it's the same sun that was in the east it was the same sun at the close of the day the same jesus christ that was back 2 000 years ago is the same s-o-n here today so he said now the prophet said there will be a day there will be day called day or night it's a dismal day a foggy day but we've had a day of that and man has known enough to join church except christ his savior go join a denomination that's about as much light as he had but remember it's evening time now civilizations on the west coast and the same s-o-n that's shown in the east at the beginning is now shining in the west at the end remember what's it do it closes there night falls on the gentiles and light dawns on the east hallelujah amen you realize even what is happening even in japan you know the light of the rising sun amen what are they seeing light is dawning but it's not stopping at japan it's moving right on over to israel as the gospel goes back to the jews amen so that actually when you realize it it'll be the the they're they're receiving their the the the the evening timeline christ coming out perfecting his church how many knows there's a difference between the appearance of christ and the coming of christ is two different words now the appear now is the appearing the coming will soon be he's appearing in the midst of us doing the works that he once did in his church notice his appearing is not just a doctrine it is not made of studious with hormone glasses and a nerd out of us a message nerd amen it is what the works of jesus christ that he once did in his church in the end time a part of that church by grace you believe it i'm a member of that church now he says i'm not a preacher you know i'm not i'm not have the education to do it sometimes i feel reluctant standing here by men of god who's called to that office there are apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists not all her apostles not all her prophets not all her teachers not all are evangelists i'm standing here and watch now he says but my ministry is different from a pastor or a teacher i'm not and if i say things wrong brethren forgive me i don't mean it but this is my ministry see to declare him that he's here amen and it's true god used brother branham singularly to declare to us with a prophetic gift that he is here not present in the corporal coming but in his appearing amen and there is a difference in his appearing and is coming in it is a purity is present in spirit form to impart revelation his coming is in the physical corporal body coming to resurrect the saints and take it as a rapture in the meeting in the air so this is in the in the true sense the word is not as coming it's disappearing and brother brother braden's ministry declared that christ is here but he said it's here in the form of the holy ghost and can heal any sickness you see we had to start believing that nothing is too hard for the lord amen for if we can't believe for divine healing how are we going to believe for the change of our body but every man who god has appeared to is called to pray for the sick if you appeared to a little housewife and you're a believer you can lay hands on your sick child and they shall recover i'm trying to make a point here amen his ministry declared that he could save the vilest sinner take rosella a girl that was you know a prostitute on drugs and alcohol and just a absolute reject of society completely and then one moment in the presence of god was transformed by the power of god he can say the violence sinner but every minister is called to preach so that even the violence sinner can be saved and romans 10 13 said whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved and how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach unless they be sick you see if god ain't calling you and god ain't ordained you you're spinning your wheels that's right amen you say well brother tim we got soul saved well i'll tell you what i we you know and yet i'm let me tell you women preachers have preached and souls got saved really but how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach unless the son of god as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring tidings of good things now but i want to tell you about this prophet the prophet's ministry went beyond that of the fivefold ministry though he was though because he was the prophet messenger to the age to bring out the mysteries of the word of god and to do this god gave brother branham a signed gift to demonstrate to to us that the word was present now when abraham saw him he saw him in a visible form but the way he's going to show himself in the last day is in his bright people and they look like just another human being like sarah thought just some men that happened by my husband's door that i got a fix for today now brother branham illustrates this in the sermon is there anything hot too hard for the lord said sarah was in a bad mood we'll get her mood a little later maybe not in this service today but there's a lot of churches in a bad mood they've done give up on the promise sitting there cold and backslidden in the back of their tent that's a whole nother sermon amen refusing without an expectation not seeing the awakening but there's another part of abraham's seed that is saying look here there's an appearance among us hallelujah there he is he's appearing among us with signs with wonder with healings with deliverance hallelujah but god gave brother branham a signed gift to demonstrate the word was present the god he come in this pillar of fire and the one that wrote the word was there to interpret the word amen and so he'd say i do not deny that there will be prophets even as in the days of paul where there was one activist a prophet who prophesied of a famine i agree that is so but i deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there is more than one major prophet messenger who will reveal the mysteries as contained in the word sorry joseph followers your prophet won't cut it sorry joseph coleman followers your your apostle won't cut it sorry level followers your teacher won't cut it there is one prophet messenger amen sorry if you think i'm the joshua sorry if you think i'm the next personality sorry you won't cut it there is one prophet messenger who will reveal the seven the mysteries that's contained in the word and who has the ministry to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers that saith the lord by his unfailing word stands and shall stand and be vindicated there is one prophet messenger to the age amen so therefore he had a ministry to him alone was given the sign gift to demonstrate the word was now being revealed the mysteries were being revealed through the seventh angel's message hebrews 4 12 turn with me let's look at the scripture one more time for the word of god is alive did i read that right the word of god is alive that's what quake means it's not a dead word it's a living word and it is powerful and it's sharper than any two-edged sword it pierces even to the dividing the sword center of soul and spirit and of the joints and tomorrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of heart you see what this the the sign gift of brother branham it showed us that the word the theophanic of god was now present using a son of man it was decent a man using a son of man a prophet as a voice to identify the unrecognized presence of god because if abraham hadn't been looking and expecting sarah in the tent would have never seen it it'd have passed her by but god had eyes looking for the appearing in the door of the tent he was watching for the moving of the holy ghost and he said i saw seven angels come from glory see are you with me amen now theophany don't just mean bodies or or saintly bodies theophanies means a a manifestation of god i saw manifestations of the spirit of god there were seven manifestations and every night one of them came and opened up seven seals to me and they were all the seven spirits of one god god manifesting himself for unfolding himself bringing to us the mysteries of god in the end time this ain't over your head you know this so i want you to see verse 13 let's look at this next verse neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight so standing on the platform i see a dog well it happened 40 years ago when you were a young girl and it scared you and i saw you run up on the porch and someone opened the door and you ran in but you see that fear that you had started right there now that person wasn't devil possessed that person was tormented by a devil by happening in their past things that your parents can try to put on you or your grandparents can haunt your life and try to form you you're not devil possessed you're devil oppressed you've got to recognize this is not me this is not who i am that was the voice of satan trying to say this is what i would be but i'm not that i am a child of the most high god and i'll break the cycle of sin and failure amen and i don't care if there's been a whole line of sex problems all through my family for a generation i am here to break that cycle because he appeared to me and with his appearing it changed me you see you've got to realize three like brother branham did he said one day i realized i was not the son of charles and ella branham i was the son of god i was a predestinated seed before the foundation of the world step out of your human line step over their failures well there's been passion there's been a temper there's been this problem step off of that you've been born again and because i'm born again ain't none of that in my past amen in my past hallelujah is a david a david and abraham and isaac a jacob in my past is a peter a james and a john in my past is the source that i come from jesus and i can break the pattern of failure and the pattern of sin well my mom and dad divorced well that might have been your mom and dad but this new one that you got with this new parent you can identify hallelujah i'm not the child of divorced parents i am a child of the almighty god i'm not an illegitimate i'm not a bastard i'm not a castle i'm a child of the mighty god oh hallelujah that's who i am hallelujah neither is there any creature that's not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open and to the eyes of him with whom we have to do so this god who could go back 40 years could go to the back part of god's mind and say i see you there your names were there in the book of life before the foundation of the world you were gods before the devil ever got to you but because of sin you came down and he defiled your body but i tell you god's not going to annihilate it he's even going to change every part of your mortal body [Applause] hallelujah and if he's going to change it there get katy take hold of it now and drop cancer out of you and diabetes out of you and sickness and disease and temper and hatred and bitterness as a pruitt i had to break a cycle i'm going to say something very personal now i can remember my mom and dad coming home from seeing their their siblings driving back home you know they were all pentecostals someone become one as someone become trinity family divided over doctrine someone got worldly some of them bobbed their hair and pained their face some of them didn't here they were now they all claim to have the holy ghost they all claim to have pentecostal experience but now they let a little bitterness come in and always coming home from tyler texas a dale did this tiny does this you know this and does that they talked about their their theirs my dad's siblings and what was going on in the family and how bad it was and you know the bickering and the fussing and the fighting over religion you know what happens when you start doing that in the family nobody wants it your kids don't want it instead of loving one another it was always down in one another and i sat there and that has a little boy in the car riding in the back of an old dodger chrysler station wagon we rode in both of them 59 we had a dodge in 64 65 we had a chrysler we had this old there's this these old station wagons and back there in the back seat here my mom and dad talked and i put my arms around my brothers and i love them to myself and i say oh god don't never let this happen in our family then we come down the road and we can believe in the same prophet same message share the same truths believe in baptism in the name of jesus christ believe in one god believe in god sent a prophet and can't worship under the same roof can't even come to special meetings any matter what is it in this family says yeah you have back and forth and some of you some of you will bring it right on down and i'm talking about my family right now write down write down in your own family and what's happening among your siblings and the in-laws is fussing and fighting and abiding and devouring one another that's what not that's not what the message is about it never was to produce that it was to produce christ amen to produce christ what's it produced bitterness fussing fighting arguments debates back bitings finding fault can't trust the ministry can't believe brother tim's really called can't believe he's really the pastor can't really believe no ah it happens you say brother jim you're putting out some dirty laundry brother branham did all the time i never intended to do this but i'm telling you i'm telling you a bunch of pruitts you gotta you've got to break the cycle and i'm telling the rest of you no matter who you are there's no perfect family other than god's family but until you break the cycle of sin and failure you can break it whether it's passion whether it's temper whether it's hatred no matter what it is you can break it oh so the word is discerned going back in the hidden things of the soul could go back 40 years in a person's life or it could go back and reveal things that are in the back part of god's mind or bring out the hidden treasures of the scripture it would even go back to john's experience on the isle of patmos and hear the seven thunders under their voices and this time tell us what they said because it knows now time for them to be made known what was it you see it was god god declaring to us the presence of god so that we would know god is with us and the promised son jesus christ will soon come not disappear but come for his bright church you see in his appearance he doesn't come in the flesh of jesus and he doesn't come in just one man that's right he didn't just come and brother brown them and he just doesn't come in in your personality cult leader or you didn't just come and tim pruitt he comes in my flesh and your flesh it's his spirit and it's an anointing first john 2 27 but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you so it is an anointing that you've received in revelation 10 it shows the mighty angel revelation 10 1. it's a it's an anointing this is not a corporal coming amen it is the period of christ amen as he comes down preparing for a bride to be raptured so you see there's a portion of the word that is laid for every age i quote brother branham here and there is some anointing comes down that projects that portion of the word for that age so it's not it is not the person of christ the physical return it is the anointing and when that anointing comes it breaks the yoke it'll break the yolk into nomination tradition family traits everything it will break it amen an anointing comes down for the purpose of revealing christ now there is darkness in the age and that purpose is to cause such confusion that people don't recognize the ministry of christ in the messenger so there's many going right by and they passed right by many and the charismatic the full gospel the full gospel businessmen the pentecostal the assembly of god they got so caught up in the darkness of the age that they could not recognize the ministry of christ in the messenger and then if they do see if they do see that darkness that devil will try to make him think that it's all in brother branham that's right our hope of glory and rapture is not seeing christ and brother branham it's in christ is recognizing christ in you that's your hope of rapture glory someone asked brother branham the question and i'll just close with this if i can but he said some say brother brown is the son of man i thought the pillar of fire was the son of man am i mistaken now i'm i'm going to quickly just kind of catch the highlights of this and paraphrase it i'm not the son of man but a son of man the son of man is jesus christ a son of man is a prophet there is quite a difference jesus christ was the son of man the son of god the son of man the son of david and now the reason that question is probably i was asked this person or been said because people regard me as a seer and then he says i am not the anointed son of man so now when we're looking here brother branham's not the anointed son of man when we look at the appearance this prophecy is not saying it's all in brother branham the pillar of fire he said is the anointing it is the logos that went out of god the logos which is actually the attribute of the fullness of god and when god came to a form where it could be seen it was the anointing of the great spirit that went forth it is condescending coming down god the father the logos that was up over israel he was holy he could not stand to see sin and then there had to be a blood offering in eden and then the logos became flesh and dwelt among us we know that was in jesus and where this logos dwelt in the human body which was the sacrifice god came down in the image of man's redeemed man and that brought man and god together heavens and earth hugged and kissed each other god and man embraced each other as fatherhood and sonship when the logos became flesh and dwelt among us jesus said i come from god and go to god is that right after his death burial resurrection ascension the body was taken up sit at the right hand of god no i don't mean god's got a right hand god is a spirit but at the right hand means in power and authority of god that in the in that name everything in heaven is named after and subject to it everything on earth is named after it's subject to it it's a name above all names jesus christ now this logos that was in him which was the spirit of god the anointing through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons to god which is anointed with the same logos so yeah again i want you to get it you know brother branham was anointed but you are anointed his office made him a prophet a messenger the eighth you know you'll never be that but you are a believer amen if you're a woman you'll never be a preacher you're not gifted to preach stay off of facebook and quit preaching there quit blessing out on instagram and all the other stuff amen you have no business trying to straighten people out and handling the word of god stop it let me just tell you you don't see me on there doing it do you and i'm called of god amen because i'm not casting pearls through the swine and i'm not putting our dirty laundry of the message out for everybody to read and i'm not getting on there to debate with this and that one and neither should you the message is not debatable i believe it that settles it god does not argue neither does his children so shut up and start facing this book and if you don't like it lump it say that's the pruitt coming out it's the holy ghost pruitt coming out of it hebrews 2 10 said he's bringing many sons to glory say many not just one many you see the message is not about brother branham he's only part of the story he's an important part of the story hey man a very integral part but that's not what it's about it's about a bride and he happened to be a part of that bride and we the bride have received the message [Applause] and it wasn't brother breton's message it was god's message to his bride he happened to be the messenger but he's also one of us who received a message it was applicable to him and his family as it is to us holiness is not for just the rest of us it's for the branham family too amen pastors and not just for us it's for the branham family too preaching is not just for uh not just for us it's for the branham family too [Music] exactly right even even tapes the message left let mine is not brother branham's intellectual property it was god's word through a prophet so it's my message so don't get mad at me when i quote my messenger because it's a message of god to the laodiceans whom we happen to be a part of this age we're the bright elect part but nevertheless we're the bart romans 8 29 for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed in the image of his son i like this when i was just a boy preacher i read it there in the original greek and it said for as many as he knew before then he also marked out to be copies of himself god selected you to be a copy of him in his image and his likeness not a cheap reproduction but a copy by the rebirth amen what was it it was a replicating of his gene for we was his gene that he had in his mind before the world began and it was in us when we were born but came alive when we were born again quickened you see that he might be help me read this the first born among many brethren amen so you see again again it's about many now the day of pentecost the logos the pillar of fire broke apart and tongues of fire set upon each of them an elected selected group identified by the pillar of fire showing that god had separated himself into man did you get it the god the logos separated himself into men god not in one person he's in his church universal and that's the reason he said the works that i do shall you do more now i know king james says greater but right the right translation said more than this shall you do god was bottled and confined in one man jesus christ but now brother l say now amen now he right now god is here embodied and confined in the whole universal church of the living god amen he's in africa amen you groups in africa listening this morning you don't have your church amen you're listening in brother caitlin let me know he his church was listening and at least his family in south africa he's in south africa he's in asia he's in europe he's in england wherever believers are gathered together there he is in the midst of them amen can i say he's the same god in texas or north carolina amen or oklahoma amen you see wherever believers are gathered together there he is in the midst of you see you don't have to belong to evening like tabernacle you don't have to come here he's appearing all over the world amen you just got to recognize his appearance you got to welcome his appearance you see it's the same logos that led moses and the children of israel the logos that was on jesus he come back from the physical form of his corporal body back to pillar of fire and is now descended on earth and has come down for an investigating judgment so it's a separating time it's a handing the opening of the book to abraham's seed it's revealing the mystery of redemption the change the promised son this is all happening and disappearing amen sarah's going to have a child amen about this time of life he gives the promise of the of the promise of the coming son you know the the salvation of loss of lord lot who represents the church who goes into tribulation all of this lays in this end time of appearing and god has identified that he is he is present in the form of the pillar of fire the logos as i said the picture was taken and it was not psychology it was not imagination it was actually there so what's the words of it the same spirit that was upon him has come up to the body again to bring us back to headship again amen and the last the last part of this is where god is taking and gathering the last stones somebody hear me preach the last stones to go in the building are now being added and shaped amen to fit the capstone so the same ministry that he had 2 000 years ago is the same ministry that he has at the end time where that the head and the body can unite together in such harmony that the two are one lord amen i am not he i'm his servant the pillar of fire is not he you see it was not the flesh of the man jesus but it's his spirit the holy ghost is christ and spirit formed the same spirit that was upon the son of man jesus christ has now come to anoint sons of men to bring back a ministry like he said it would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to be there so he cannot come until a church of body believers in the ministry he once had will have to be the same as it was then if it had tongues in it then it has to have tongues in it now if it had prophecy then it has to have prophecy now if it had divine healing then it has to have divine healing now the same ministry the same christ the same jesus jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever let's stand together we must have this ministry to raise up the lutherans wesley and all of them down to the ages them that are in the dust cannot come forth until the fullness is manifested in bride form let him appear to you this morning welcome his appearing welcome into your life welcoming to your heart let him change you in his presence will you bow your head just for a moment you say brother tim i've had lots of different appearance but i
