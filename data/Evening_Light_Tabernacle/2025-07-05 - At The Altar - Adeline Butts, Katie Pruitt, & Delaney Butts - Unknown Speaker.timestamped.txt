[0:07] [Music]
[0:17] I'm removing
[0:21] all of the things that could move me
[0:25] further from you. I think you could not
[0:29] be enough.
[0:32] It's not lost on me what you saved me
[0:35] from. I'm running
[0:40] stumbling I know but I'm coming
[0:44] to give you this offering my worship or
[0:48] never withhold.
[0:51] broken, but you call it beautiful.
[0:56] [Music]
[0:58] Where the tears of the desperate
[1:01] [Music]
[1:02] reach the feet of the Savior,
[1:07] nothing I wouldn't offer.
[1:10] There's no waste at the altar
[1:16] where the heart of surrender
[1:20] meets the hands of the maker.
[1:23] [Music]
[1:25] Nothing I wouldn't offer.
[1:28] There's no waste at the altar.
[1:36] [Music]
[1:40] Things I've treed
[1:43] couldn't come close to your presence.
[1:48] Grace upon grace, who could measure?
[1:53] No, nothing could measure.
[1:58] I'm returning
[2:00] back to the one I am wanting
[2:05] to give him my love. He took a sinner
[2:09] like me.
[2:12] Wash me with grace and then set me free.
[2:17] [Music]
[2:22] May the tears of the desperate
[2:26] reach the feet of the Savior.
[2:30] Nothing I wouldn't offer.
[2:34] There's no way at the altar
[2:38] where the heart of surrender
[2:42] meets the hands of the maker.
[2:46] Nothing I wouldn't offer.
[2:50] There's no way at the altar.
[2:53] [Music]
[3:02] Come lay your broken dreams at the
[3:05] altar. And every victory at the altar.
[3:11] Fear and anxiety cannot live here.
[3:16] There's no waste at the altar. Let your
[3:20] heart sing out. Tell him you love him.
[3:24] Don't make it perfect. Let it be honest.
[3:28] He can use anything. Sit back and watch
[3:32] him. There's no waste at the altar. Come
[3:38] lay your broken dreams at the altar. And
[3:42] every victory at the altar. Fear and
[3:47] anxiety cannot live here.
[3:52] No waste at the altar. Let your heart
[3:56] sing out and tell him you love it. Don't
[4:00] make it perfect. Just let it be hest. He
[4:04] can use anything. Sit back and watch
[4:07] him. There's no waste at the altar.
[4:13] There's no waste at the altar.
[4:17] There's no waste at the altar.
[4:21] There's no waste at the altar.
[4:26] [Music]
[4:29] Come lay your broken dreams at the
[4:33] altar. And every victory at the altar.
[4:38] Fear and anxiety cannot live here.
[4:43] There's no waste at the altar. Let your
[4:47] heart sing out and tell him you love
[4:50] him. Don't make it perfect. Just let it
[4:54] be honest. He can use anything. Sit back
[4:58] and watch.
[5:00] There's no waste at the altar.
[5:05] There's no waste at the altar.
[5:09] No waste at the altar.
[5:15] [Applause]
