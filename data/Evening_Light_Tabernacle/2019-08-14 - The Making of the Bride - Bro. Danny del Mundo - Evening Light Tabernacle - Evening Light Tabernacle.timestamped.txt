[25:54] miracle is on the making
[26:00] amen
[26:01] hallelujah so god bless you and before I
[26:06] let you sit down for a while I just want
[26:08] to read the portion of the scripture and
[26:11] you know build a knee I'm just I'm just
[26:14] a simple preacher and don't have my own
[26:18] message amen we just feasting on the
[26:20] message of the hour hallelujah so let's
[26:23] read from the book of Job chapter 23
[26:29] familiar scriptures start in verse 8 it
[26:37] says here behold I go forward but he's
[26:43] not there and backward but I cannot
[26:47] precede him on the left hand where he
[26:50] doth work but I cannot behold him he
[26:55] hided himself on the right hand that I
[26:58] cannot see him but he knoweth the way
[27:03] that I think when he had tried me I
[27:06] shall come forth as gold and this is
[27:10] what God wants us to be my food had held
[27:15] his steps his way have I kept and not
[27:19] declined neither have i gone back from
[27:22] the commandment of his lips
[27:24] I have steamed the words of his mouth
[27:27] more than my necessary food I believe
[27:30] that's our condition tonight amen
[27:33] his word amen is more important than
[27:36] anything else
[27:38] hallelu Ellis just bar heads in prayer
[27:39] the revelry father we commit everything
[27:42] into your mighty hands Lord you know
[27:47] what we need and you can speak from your
[27:51] throne of mercy tonight we believe God
[27:54] that you're the same yesterday today and
[27:56] forever
[27:57] Lord God you know where we are and you
[28:02] know where we are going because you know
[28:05] where we come from
[28:07] and so by these words that have come
[28:11] from you we just want to share it Lord
[28:13] God amen as we commit everything into
[28:16] your mighty hands bless your people
[28:17] tonight in Jesus Christ wonderful name
[28:19] everybody say Amen amen
[28:22] god bless you amen let us give a clap
[28:25] offering for the Lord this evening
[28:27] amen god bless you you may be seated
[28:30] all right amen and it's a good thing to
[28:35] see my precious friend once again but
[28:38] brother Craig is family back here amen
[28:42] of course but the George winters amen
[28:45] he's shining there at the back amen so
[28:49] we're just so glad he meant to be to be
[28:53] in the house of the Lord and to be one
[28:55] in the family amen
[28:57] you know God is a God of variety amen
[29:01] so that's why he has sons and daughters
[29:03] all over the world and it's a good thing
[29:06] that when we when we meet up and we see
[29:09] when we gather together him and we see
[29:11] the beauty of God he meets and every one
[29:13] of us tonight
[29:14] amen so I just would like to speak about
[29:17] a simple subject this evening about the
[29:20] making of the bride amen
[29:23] so so the making of the bride there is
[29:28] only one bride amen and because there is
[29:33] only one groom
[29:34] amen so you see now in this part of the
[29:40] scripture I want to deal more on on
[29:43] Burstein which says but he knoweth the
[29:46] way that I take when he had tried me I
[29:50] shall come forth as gold Amen you know
[29:53] that we believe that nothing is hidden
[29:55] in the sight of God he knew us before
[30:00] the foundation of the world and because
[30:04] he knew must before the foundation of
[30:06] the world he already knew where we are
[30:09] going
[30:10] amen a lot of people have no knowledge
[30:14] about that we never knew about it until
[30:16] we heard this message of the hour
[30:18] and I believe this message of the hour
[30:20] you know it did not make a sons and
[30:23] daughters of God but this message of the
[30:27] hour made us realize that we are sons
[30:32] and daughters of God amen in the mind of
[30:35] God we were already in him amen and but
[30:41] we come to a point that we realize who
[30:45] we are
[30:46] amen and we realize you know I'm part of
[30:50] this body I'm proud of the bride of the
[30:52] Lord Jesus Christ and then I realize
[30:54] then I know how to conduct myself
[30:56] because I have been privileged to be
[31:00] chosen by the Lord before the foundation
[31:02] of the world hallelujah
[31:04] so now listen so in this we see if we
[31:08] talk about job but Birmingham said job
[31:11] the book of Job is the oldest book in
[31:14] the Bible it was written he said Moses
[31:19] wrote Genesis several hundred years
[31:22] after Amen so if this is the oldest book
[31:26] I mean it it it was already in the mind
[31:30] of God and we know this is the old book
[31:34] it contains everything in it so I would
[31:39] like to believe tonight Amen that this
[31:42] book of Job being the oldest of all the
[31:45] books that have been written and is
[31:48] being available according to the profit
[31:51] of of God in this day and age then it
[31:54] contains everything that the whole Bible
[31:59] has because in it you see that's why you
[32:05] see in in in in in job if we're going to
[32:10] read job chapter one up to verse three
[32:15] look at this is that there was a man in
[32:18] the land of Koos whose name was job and
[32:20] that man was perfect and upright and one
[32:24] that feared God and eschewed evil and
[32:26] there were born unto him seven sons and
[32:28] three daughters
[32:29] his substance also over 7,000 ship and
[32:33] 3,000 camels and 500 yoke of oxen and
[32:37] 500 she asses and a very great household
[32:41] so that this man was the greatest of all
[32:44] the men of the East that's chapter one
[32:47] amen
[32:48] and then if we pass forward and don't
[32:55] read the rest of the book of Job and
[32:57] then we we move to chapter 42 which is
[33:01] the last part of the book of Job then we
[33:04] can see there in verse 10 and the Lord
[33:07] turned the captivity of job when he
[33:09] prayed for his friends also the Lord
[33:11] gave job twice as much as he had before
[33:15] then came Durant to him all his brethren
[33:18] and all his sisters and all day that had
[33:22] been a beast acquaintance before and did
[33:24] eat bread with him in his house and they
[33:26] bemoaned him and comforted him over all
[33:29] the evil that the Lord had brought upon
[33:31] him every man also gave him a piece of
[33:33] money and everyone an earring of God so
[33:36] the Lord blessed the latter end of job
[33:37] more than his beginning for he had
[33:41] 14,000 sheep originally 7,000 and 6,000
[33:47] camus in chapter 1 it's three thousand
[33:50] and a thousand yoke of oxen in chapter
[33:53] one it was five thousand and a thousand
[33:55] she asses Amen so everything doubled in
[33:59] the end amen so if we reabsorb in the
[34:05] beginning and then we make a short cut
[34:07] at the end then we see how God blessed
[34:10] doubly job all right and you know God
[34:16] you know he's the Alpha and the Omega
[34:18] he's the author and the finisher of our
[34:21] faith amen
[34:23] but I believe amen he still is the
[34:26] beginning he is the end but he is the
[34:29] same God in between all right so you see
[34:33] if we don't look at the the chapters
[34:37] between chapter one and the last chapter
[34:40] which
[34:41] chapter 42 and we're just going to look
[34:43] at job but you know God is so blessed
[34:46] you know at the beginning of his life
[34:48] and at the end of his life you know god
[34:50] bless him double x twice of the
[34:54] blessings that he had amen
[34:57] so but looking through you know what I'm
[35:01] speaking about in between we know how
[35:05] job lived a miserable life he passed
[35:11] through lot of things hardships troubles
[35:16] even his friends even his wife and
[35:20] family loved him he was left with
[35:23] nothing eminent and you see one time
[35:27] when when there was a servant of him who
[35:32] came and reported what had happened you
[35:35] know and and the Bible said while this
[35:38] servant was just reporting what happened
[35:41] Amen well he was yet speaking and then
[35:45] another trouble came amen and and
[35:48] another trouble came it came in waves
[35:50] and waves and waves hallelujah so
[35:54] everything gets in there everything all
[35:56] kinds of hardship came to Joe and we
[36:00] don't see that even if we just read the
[36:03] beginning and the ending of the book of
[36:05] Job so now now my point this evening as
[36:10] brother Branham said in a walk and our
[36:13] Christian walk in a walk as a message
[36:16] believer Remenham said God did not just
[36:20] put us in a pipe in one end amen and
[36:24] then wait on the other end and then he
[36:28] said come on come on come out of it and
[36:31] then afterwards when we came out of the
[36:33] end of the pipe and then God
[36:35] congratulated us and then he says God
[36:38] job well done we have not done anything
[36:41] we have not accomplished anything we
[36:44] didn't pass any kind of trouble that way
[36:46] amen but God amen in his in his mind in
[36:51] his full control of everything
[36:54] know
[36:54] from the beginning till the end
[36:57] hallelujah God you know it will let us
[37:00] experience a lot of things in between
[37:03] but at the end we know Amen that God had
[37:07] pre-planned so that in the end we will
[37:09] we will praise Him we will worship Him
[37:12] we will thank him hallelujah and when we
[37:16] overcome all these trials and and the
[37:20] struggles all these kinds of sickness
[37:22] that have come our way that have become
[37:24] our loved ones and then in the end it is
[37:27] it is precious to worship God because of
[37:30] all these things
[37:31] hallelujah and so that's why you know
[37:34] God loves his people who worship Him
[37:40] even after trials I mean I remember Paul
[37:45] and Silas when when they were called by
[37:48] God and they they received the message
[37:51] and they spread the message outside and
[37:54] then people did not agree with them and
[37:57] all this authorities have arrested them
[37:59] and then whipped them and remove all
[38:01] their other clothes and everything and
[38:07] then afterwards you know in the evening
[38:11] time well while they were well they were
[38:13] in in in the inside the jail you know at
[38:18] midnight they still feel the pains but
[38:24] they didn't complain amen but in the
[38:28] evening time you know when when you
[38:31] experienced some kind of a wound and you
[38:33] didn't put any any medical things on
[38:40] that you know you don't put you don't
[38:42] apply anything on there you know it gets
[38:45] so painful amen
[38:49] so the deeper the night gets it becomes
[38:54] more painful but you see in during that
[38:59] midnight amen
[39:02] Paul and Silas woke up
[39:06] because it was dying for them to worship
[39:10] and they prayed and they worship
[39:14] hallelujah and they worship so so hard
[39:19] amen they worship so deeply and so
[39:23] sincere amen that the prisoners that the
[39:26] inside the jail amen
[39:29] beyond the the that the place where they
[39:32] where that means they were not silent in
[39:34] praising and worshiping the Lord
[39:35] hallelujah because their voices went up
[39:38] and beyond the room beyond the jail that
[39:41] they were in hallelujah and so suddenly
[39:43] a man it did not only their boys did not
[39:47] only reach a man the nearby
[39:50] jail house or rooms Amen but it even
[39:53] beyond even it went beyond Rehan
[39:59] hallelujah it reaches and the angels
[40:02] were able to hear them and God was able
[40:05] to hear them too that God was able to
[40:07] send an angel and shook the place amen
[40:12] and so something have happened on that
[40:14] and only so you when they worship God
[40:17] and suddenly you know all chains were
[40:19] broken you know sometimes the the
[40:23] preacher has not preached yet but while
[40:26] we're worshiping God somebody you just
[40:29] come in they come in the door and he
[40:31] feel so happy is there's so much burden
[40:33] in his heart and there's so much things
[40:35] going on in his mind
[40:37] amen but just try to set the atmosphere
[40:40] because our manner of worship and and it
[40:43] brings us in a certain level certain
[40:45] kind of atmosphere hallelujah just
[40:48] before the preaching of the world
[40:51] the hearts are being cultivated just
[40:53] like a dry salt being cultivated and
[40:56] it's open up enemy and little by little
[40:58] the world is ready to be dropped and
[41:04] that makest makes it easier for the
[41:06] preacher to preach hallelujah and so
[41:10] they're changed you know little by
[41:12] little something is dropping you know
[41:14] the the prisoners were being released
[41:22] you know just by the means of prayers
[41:27] and worship people are being released
[41:33] amen so and so these things God you know
[41:38] in his in his mind you know knowing from
[41:41] the beginning to the end as job said you
[41:45] know job said he knoweth the way that I
[41:47] think and that gives me a confidence
[41:50] that God knows everything
[41:52] God knows amen what the road should I
[41:56] take and I have great confidence in him
[42:00] amen and so he said he know that the way
[42:02] that I take when he tried me so trials
[42:07] are being approved by God when God spoke
[42:15] proudly about job on Satan have you
[42:20] tried my son job he got his confidence
[42:25] in job he take pride in him and so now
[42:31] of course were so much familiar with
[42:33] that and then so when when God when God
[42:35] said okay you know you can try you can
[42:38] do everything with job but don't take
[42:40] his life that means even Satan submit
[42:44] himself amen as far as God can approve
[42:49] that means everything that happens in
[42:52] our lives God has approval in it and he
[42:56] has one purpose
[42:59] at the end of the road we shall be like
[43:02] him as gold because God is a deity
[43:06] goddess gold and sons and daughters of
[43:08] God must be at the end shall be like
[43:11] gold job said he said that he knoweth
[43:15] the way that I take when I get tried me
[43:17] I shall come forth as gold amen
[43:20] so because God wants to to give him or
[43:24] to give us his his his nature his
[43:28] characteristics you know people can
[43:31] manufacture characteristics right
[43:36] because you know there are fruits of the
[43:42] Holy Spirit but you know you know now
[43:45] they can produce what we call this these
[43:47] plastic things you know they make and
[43:49] they look like real fruits amen
[43:55] but there's nothing in it all right so
[43:59] you know it looks like fruits look like
[44:02] it looks like grapes looks like it looks
[44:04] like Ming or something but there's
[44:06] nothing to it it's just a manufactured
[44:10] thing you know we can manufacture love
[44:13] we can manufacture all these things all
[44:17] these outward things amen
[44:20] but we cannot produce a Jean wine fruit
[44:23] if there is no Holy Ghost in it but
[44:27] listen when there is the Holy Spirit you
[44:30] don't have to manufacture things and
[44:32] then you don't have to try and then you
[44:35] don't have to put any extra effort in it
[44:38] because the proofs will just come out I
[44:40] mean brother branham's I just think that
[44:42] you know when when the Holy Spirit in
[44:44] there it will just produce amen it will
[44:48] just bear fruits in it the proof will
[44:51] just come out hallelujah so that's why
[44:54] is he now
[44:57] know this is very much familiar we
[44:58] always caught on it the character is a
[45:01] victory it's not a gift
[45:03] amen so we work in it so he said oh is
[45:08] it a man without character can't rain
[45:10] because power apart from car
[45:12] Theresa tonic but power with character
[45:15] is fit to rule and since he wants us to
[45:19] share even is thrown on the same basis
[45:22] that he overcame and sat down in his
[45:24] Father's throne then we have to overcome
[45:27] to sit with him and the little temporary
[45:30] suffering we go through now is not
[45:33] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[45:35] glory that will be revealed in us when
[45:39] he comes
[45:39] well what pressures are laid up for
[45:41] those who are willing are you willing a
[45:45] man is that what those who are willing
[45:48] to enter into his kingdom through much
[45:52] tribulation
[45:56] you know perfection comes by trials and
[46:01] sometimes you know you know people you
[46:04] know you want to be perfect there they
[46:05] want to be perfect but if you want to be
[46:07] perfect that means you want more trials
[46:09] in it they said think it not strange
[46:15] concerning the fiery trials that are to
[46:17] try you that is what Peter said is it
[46:21] strange that God wants us to develop a
[46:23] christ-like character that comes through
[46:25] suffering no sir and we all have trials
[46:29] amen
[46:31] I was conversing with Mary Craig in the
[46:34] room and he said you know just like but
[46:36] they had said you know if there is a
[46:38] little church a small church is a small
[46:41] problem you have a big Church you have a
[46:45] big problem but if you have no church
[46:49] you are the problem
[46:56] you should have our own church amen we
[47:00] should realize where we belong
[47:01] Amen which family we should have a home
[47:04] church and an a pastor that we can you
[47:07] know that we can entrust him amen so you
[47:12] see now we all have trials we all we are
[47:14] all tried and chasing the sons not one
[47:17] but goes through that the church that is
[47:19] not suffering and is not being tried
[47:23] hasn't got it it isn't of God Amen
[47:29] because he said in Hebrews chapter 12
[47:31] verse 6 for whom the Lord loveth he
[47:33] chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom
[47:35] he receiveth but if he be without
[47:37] chastisement we're of all the partakers
[47:40] then he are bastards and not sons so but
[47:48] venoms said this in the Church of Smyrna
[47:51] but he said because the special
[47:53] condition is Smyrna must be applied to
[47:56] every age there is no age free from it
[48:00] there is no true believer free from it
[48:03] this is of God this is the will of God
[48:07] this is the will of the trial sufferings
[48:11] persecutions tribulations this is the
[48:15] will of God I say amen to that because
[48:18] that is what the prophet of God said it
[48:20] is needful why because God wants to see
[48:23] us at the end just like so just like job
[48:27] said I will come like gold in the end so
[48:32] there is no true believer pre from it
[48:34] this is of God this is the willow body
[48:36] this nipple we need the Lord to teach us
[48:38] the truth that we are to suffer and be
[48:40] christ-like in doing it love suffereth
[48:42] long and is kind
[48:45] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[48:47] and persecute you and shall say all
[48:49] manner of evil against you falsely for
[48:51] my sake are you Holly rollers rejoice
[49:00] amen
[49:01] when you are being named when you're
[49:03] being branded in anything rejoice
[49:07] amen for great is your reward in heaven
[49:10] for so persecuted they the prophets
[49:12] which are before you and I like this
[49:17] portion the cloud disguised and storms
[49:20] of life are no signs of God's
[49:22] disapproval sometimes we question all
[49:25] why did it happen to me the moment I
[49:27] received the message something happened
[49:30] neither our bright skies and still water
[49:32] signs of Islam in approval his approval
[49:35] of any of us is only in the beloved his
[49:37] lobby's elective which he had for us
[49:39] before the foundation of the world the
[49:43] syllabus yes but how shall we know we
[49:46] shall know because he said so and
[49:48] manifested that he did love us for he
[49:51] brought us to himself and gave us or be
[49:53] spirit placing us as sons and now shall
[49:56] I prove my love to him by believing what
[49:58] he said and by conducting myself
[50:02] we joy amidst the trials that he in his
[50:06] wisdom allows to come to pass amen you
[50:11] know we Filipinos are known to be
[50:13] resilient you know you only in the
[50:16] Philippines where you can see people are
[50:18] you know swimming in the flood you know
[50:20] and you know the work is just up here
[50:22] and you can take pictures and their
[50:24] smiling is that by believing what he
[50:32] said and by conducting myself
[50:34] we joy emits the trials that he in his
[50:38] wisdom allows to come to pass that's why
[50:42] we are called oddballs amen
[50:45] so you see we enter into a certain
[50:48] process so this God this our God is the
[50:52] same God in between Amen because God
[50:56] wants us to enter into a certain process
[50:59] that in the end Amen a son and daughter
[51:03] of God will come out and it only comes
[51:09] with with trials and testings and so
[51:13] there must be a way through him so and
[51:16] and people must recognize God's
[51:19] there is no other way you know just like
[51:23] the world you know the denominations
[51:26] they rejoice you know in John chapter 3
[51:28] verse 16 it said for God so loved the
[51:30] world that He gave His only begotten Son
[51:32] that whosoever believeth on him should
[51:33] not perish but will have eternal life
[51:35] that is something which is encouraging
[51:39] amen
[51:40] but it must come through God's process
[51:44] and you know it it is not just that the
[51:47] preacher lets you feel you're a
[51:49] Christian we must help to pass through a
[51:54] certain process and there is no other
[51:57] process but through the blood of the
[51:59] Lord Jesus Christ by justification
[52:02] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[52:04] Spirit and then you cannot be justified
[52:07] amen
[52:08] without passing through that blood and
[52:11] that's why even in the Old Testament God
[52:13] never changed his pattern and then in
[52:16] the Old Testament you know before you
[52:17] enter into the tabernacle you have to
[52:20] pass through you have to to kill a
[52:23] sacrifice and then you have to offer a
[52:26] sacrifice and then you you have to cut
[52:29] his throat and the blood must be spilled
[52:31] amen there is no other way you have to
[52:36] pass through that way and so in the same
[52:38] manner in this generation there is
[52:40] neither one we talked about the rapture
[52:41] there is no other way but this message
[52:44] of the hour outside of the message of
[52:48] the hour we can a man or a woman cannot
[52:51] expect rapture people can talk about it
[52:54] people can expect it but unless they say
[52:57] the message of the hour and then
[52:59] hallelujah the maturing faith will not
[53:01] be produced in them hallelujah so these
[53:06] three stages of grace and we must to
[53:08] pass through all these things and so
[53:10] when brother Branham preached about the
[53:13] state of a perfect man amen and we see
[53:16] only in the message we find it you know
[53:19] when when I shared something about the
[53:21] stage' of a perfect man you know you
[53:22] pray for Myanmar amen and all of course
[53:25] in Japan a lot of things are going on
[53:26] but in Myanmar there's a lot of great
[53:29] that the Lord is doing as I mentioned
[53:31] before you know I have been praying for
[53:33] Myanmar that the Lord will produce more
[53:37] translators in younger ministers you
[53:39] know that will go with us and to go
[53:42] around Myanmar and and spread this
[53:46] endtime gospel I mean in God amen honors
[53:50] our word God honors our prayers because
[53:53] we have no other we have no other desire
[53:56] we're not building any Kingdom and when
[53:59] our passion is only poor lost souls and
[54:03] God is so short a time I mean in my
[54:07] previous trip I mean the Lord gave me
[54:09] but him gave me four young translators a
[54:12] man that can go around go with me and by
[54:16] God's grace we were able to print the
[54:17] church age book and we were able to
[54:19] distribute that and there is a young man
[54:22] a man he came out of the denomination
[54:25] already and Easter has started
[54:27] independent churches and he has under
[54:31] him around thirteen ministers in my
[54:37] previous trip before last amen I was
[54:40] able I was given a chance to share this
[54:44] message and every Monday because you
[54:47] know brother Danny he said his name is
[54:49] but Michael week I stopped going to
[54:54] Bible School and this young ministers
[54:56] you know we have no place to go and so
[54:58] every Monday week I gathered them and so
[55:01] he gave me one slap and I shared the
[55:04] basic things about the message then they
[55:06] rejoice over it and then last last trip
[55:10] this brother gave me all the sessions in
[55:14] one whole day and I presented the
[55:17] message in the whole day three sessions
[55:20] amen and then we distributed the books
[55:23] and before I came home the brother said
[55:25] brother Danny the the ministers are
[55:28] still asking for more books
[55:30] shall I give them okay give them books
[55:33] as much as you can
[55:34] amen because next time when we go back
[55:36] there
[55:37] amen I told them you read this book you
[55:40] study it and then when we go back let's
[55:42] about it I mean I was sharing with the
[55:44] brothers you know there was a brother
[55:46] one of them history he translated for me
[55:49] and then I shared about the original sin
[55:52] and you could tell you while I was
[55:54] sharing the original sin sometimes he
[55:56] stops and said what maybe in his mind
[56:00] you say what is better than is saying
[56:02] about all these things and so when I
[56:05] turned back III went home he messaged me
[56:10] and I showed the brothers his his
[56:12] questions and I poured him with
[56:14] scriptures and everything in the end he
[56:16] said now it's clear there is a Filipino
[56:31] bride I believe there is a Japanese
[56:33] bride I believe there is there's a
[56:35] bright also in Myanmar and we just had
[56:37] to to cross all these kinds of borders a
[56:41] meant to be able to to send you know and
[56:44] share this message this gospel and let
[56:46] God do his own thing
[56:48] there's seeds down there amen this is
[56:52] down there and they just have to to hear
[56:54] the word of God you know but it's also
[56:56] easy that's why sometimes even in the
[56:59] ministry at times you know we encounter
[57:01] some problems we encounter some
[57:03] challenges we're not excused on that you
[57:06] go to Mission you have a lot of problems
[57:09] you know going to missions that just you
[57:11] know you not just desiring that you you
[57:13] have another stamp in your passport amen
[57:18] you go to Mission amen of course in
[57:20] Japan at least in Japan everything is
[57:25] you know everything is good there
[57:28] although everything is expensive amen
[57:32] but you go to you Myanmar it's a
[57:34] different thing you got to Cambodia it's
[57:37] a different thing but it's all missions
[57:45] for God's glory amen but we're not
[57:49] looking on the hardships but we're
[57:52] looking at the end
[57:54] because we know at the end hallelujah
[57:58] their sons and daughters of God the
[58:00] predestinated sons and daughters that
[58:01] will come into open and they will
[58:04] receive the message of the hour
[58:06] hallelujah so you see that's why we
[58:10] don't complain God is looking for
[58:12] believers and not complainers says he
[58:14] just like when God called Moses to
[58:17] deliver Israel God promised them a land
[58:22] which is filled with milk and honey yeah
[58:27] but he never told them but Timothy about
[58:30] the Red Sea about the wilderness no he
[58:33] just told them about you know the land
[58:37] the good land so that's why in the
[58:40] process in Exodus is not this the word
[58:44] that we did tell the in Egypt saying let
[58:46] us alone that we may serve the Egyptians
[58:48] for it had been better for us to serve
[58:50] the Egyptians than that we should die in
[58:52] the wilderness you know brother branham
[58:55] said oh this old manna that was out
[58:57] every night why we'd rather have some
[58:59] garlic and leak out of Egypt you see
[59:01] that hurts wasn't ready for the journey
[59:03] if you are a complainer pray about it
[59:08] you're not ready for the journey we
[59:14] should stop complaining amen
[59:18] now when we feel something that is going
[59:20] against what we are expecting look at
[59:23] the end of the story
[59:26] amen look at the end of the story and
[59:29] you will overcome all these things we
[59:33] know at the end I shall comfort us gold
[59:36] as job said amen and when a man or a
[59:40] woman begins to complain about going to
[59:42] church they get so tired of going to
[59:46] church they're not ready for the journey
[59:47] that's right there's something wrong
[59:49] somewhere
[59:51] Amen sometimes people go to church
[59:54] because they feel good but Paul and
[59:59] Silas they didn't feel good
[1:00:04] but they worship the Lord Amon so it's
[1:00:11] the God in between now I like this
[1:00:14] portion he said and Moses because they
[1:00:16] were complaining and Moses said unto the
[1:00:18] people fear you now stand still and see
[1:00:23] the salvation of the Lord you know when
[1:00:26] there is a problem when there is a
[1:00:29] something like you know a heavy thing in
[1:00:33] front of us
[1:00:34] Amen stand still God is going to do
[1:00:37] something great expect was something
[1:00:41] great and and and Moses said and see the
[1:00:44] salvation of the Lord
[1:00:45] which he will shew to you today for the
[1:00:47] Egyptians whom you have seen today ye
[1:00:51] shall see them again no more forever
[1:00:55] Egyptians giving all kinds of troubles
[1:00:58] in front of them and here is the prophet
[1:01:00] told them he meant standstill because
[1:01:04] for the Egyptians whom we have seen
[1:01:07] today you shall see them again no more
[1:01:12] forever glory a man I like to hear that
[1:01:18] you know you shall see these Egyptians
[1:01:20] no more but does that mean we're not
[1:01:23] going to face enemies no no in Exodus
[1:01:30] chapter 3 verse 8 you shall see no more
[1:01:34] Egyptians before you your enemies the
[1:01:38] Egyptians will no longer stand before
[1:01:40] you you will see them no more forever
[1:01:43] and that's good but the necks of this
[1:01:47] chapter 3 verse 8 listen and I come down
[1:01:50] to deliver them out of the hand of the
[1:01:52] Egyptians and to bring them up out of
[1:01:55] the land and to good land and large and
[1:01:57] to a land flowing with milk and honey
[1:01:59] listen
[1:02:00] no more Egyptians but in the land which
[1:02:04] is flowing with milk and honey listen
[1:02:06] how many enemies are facing facing the
[1:02:10] the Hebrew children
[1:02:12] to the place of the Canaanites the
[1:02:15] Hittites the overrides the Perizzites
[1:02:21] the Hivites the Jebusites no more
[1:02:26] Egyptians but when you get there you
[1:02:32] have all these kinds of sites all kinds
[1:02:36] of web sites amen
[1:02:39] so you base all these things no more
[1:02:41] Egyptians forever but there is more
[1:02:44] enemies down there because it's a land
[1:02:48] filled with milk and honey and then
[1:02:50] because when you go with the land that
[1:02:52] is so rich and that is flowing with milk
[1:02:55] and honey let me tell you there are
[1:02:57] enemies down there there will be
[1:02:59] somebody that will prevent you in going
[1:03:02] in and stepping into it it's all yours
[1:03:05] but the devil will try to stop you in
[1:03:11] there the Holy Ghost is available for
[1:03:16] everyone who wants it amen and now the
[1:03:20] devil will try everything hallelujah you
[1:03:23] will enjoy them there's no more Egyptian
[1:03:25] when enemies down but eight more is
[1:03:27] coming hallelujah but tell them come on
[1:03:30] hallelujah
[1:03:31] I already saw the ending I saw the
[1:03:34] ending
[1:03:36] even just come forward look in between

[1:03:55] bring them up out of the land unto a
[1:03:56] good land and a large land who large
[1:04:01] lands but sometimes people think all
[1:04:06] we're going to a promised land a large
[1:04:08] land flowing with milk and honey
[1:04:13] you know maybe some some people are
[1:04:16] thinking they will they will find a
[1:04:18] river or a stream that is flowing with
[1:04:21] milk and honey no no no no there is no
[1:04:27] such river like that in the promised
[1:04:30] land you don't find a stream you don't
[1:04:33] pray you don't find a brook or something
[1:04:35] that flows with milk and honey but

[1:06:10] service amen because we find our place
[1:06:15] in the body of Christ amen
[1:06:17] says in Hebrews he said but beloved we
[1:06:20] are persuaded better things of you and
[1:06:23] things that accompany salvation amen

[1:06:59] always beautiful don't look in between
[1:07:06] don't stop in between go through to the
[1:07:10] end amen so you see in the message I

[1:07:19] problems come god-honest Robel puts bits
[1:07:21] in his mouth and make it obey him and
[1:07:24] those troubles bring us into a closer
[1:07:28] fellowship with God that's the purpose
[1:07:32] amen well as I said we ask for comfort
[1:07:36] and peace God gives us the best he could
[1:07:39] give trials and tribulations

[1:08:33] live only on the Word of God of that
[1:08:36] AIDS amen so you're Roman Creed

[1:08:53] forth out of the land of Egypt all the
[1:08:55] days of thy life is that in paragraph
[1:08:58] 127 in the beautiful bride of Christ
[1:09:01] after her death through the Dark Ages by
[1:09:05] the Roman Empire that she had to die
[1:09:07] amen so listen amen
[1:09:09] even if you look at the whole picture of
[1:09:12] the bride of the church in history amen
[1:09:17] it felt you know it went down to the
[1:09:20] grave in the dark ages but because there
[1:09:23] is light in her even Dairy seed in her
[1:09:27] you know that was the mistake that Satan
[1:09:32] did to the scene when he buried the seed
[1:09:36] amen because there is life in that seed
[1:09:39] when that was buried under the ground
[1:09:42] it grew even in the dark ages amen
[1:09:45] the bride was also also placed in the
[1:09:48] under the grave a man in the dark ages
[1:09:51] but because there is life in it there is
[1:09:53] a seed German de
[1:09:56] it is it's not you know it's not an
[1:09:59] organization but it is something
[1:10:01] hallelujah inside of there is life in it
[1:10:05] so it come it came out and in the end
[1:10:08] hallelujah it produced it shows its
[1:10:11] beauty showing the bride of the Lord
[1:10:14] Jesus Christ so you see the bride in the
[1:10:16] making
[1:10:17] amen and Paul said I have espoused you
[1:10:23] to one husband see he was also ready
[1:10:26] looking at the end he was already
[1:10:29] looking in the last days amen
[1:10:33] a bride spouse to the bridegroom and he
[1:10:43] said now he said the bridegroom had to
[1:10:45] come the perfect masterpiece of God
[1:10:47] you've all heard my message on that and
[1:10:50] that he said he's experienced about
[1:10:52] Michelangelo and he said it's a perfect
[1:10:54] statue all but on the right knee there
[1:10:57] is a Nika bout a half inch deep
[1:11:01] Michelangelo had spent a lifetime of
[1:11:03] trying to make he was a sculptor and he
[1:11:06] was trying to make the image of Moses
[1:11:07] now you know as I have said before you
[1:11:10] know an ordinary person can look at a
[1:11:13] certain log and all he sees in that lag
[1:11:17] are firewood that's how far he can look
[1:11:23] at it amen
[1:11:24] but you know there are gifted men
[1:11:27] sculptors look differently when they
[1:11:31] look at the log they just don't see any
[1:11:35] firewood but they look through it
[1:11:39] amen the scatter can see an eagle inside
[1:11:44] and when he holds his chisel and his
[1:11:48] hammer and suddenly he he start to work
[1:11:52] on it and the Eagle that he sees inside
[1:11:56] a man little by little it comes into the
[1:11:59] open it's being revealed what's inside
[1:12:03] that lock
[1:12:04] even no people in the world they look at
[1:12:08] us like our bulls were nothing amen
[1:12:13] we're not something special but in the
[1:12:16] side of the greatness is sculptor of all
[1:12:18] he sees something inside you amen
[1:12:22] hallelujah and so because he see
[1:12:24] something inside you then when he start
[1:12:26] to hold this hammer and his Jesus and he
[1:12:28] work on you amen and he manifests it
[1:12:33] display what's inside of you you're an
[1:12:36] eagle to begin with
[1:12:37] hallelujah God show you before the
[1:12:40] foundation of the world but you have to
[1:12:42] come to a certain process amen
[1:12:47] so now he sees Michelangelo he said
[1:12:49] spent a lifetime of trying to make a
[1:12:51] sculptor and he was think to make the
[1:12:53] image of Moses back in his mind he had
[1:12:55] in mind what Moses should look like he
[1:12:57] had that in his heart what Moses should
[1:12:59] look like and when he spent his lifetime
[1:13:01] chisel a little here and rabbit stand
[1:13:04] back and look at it year after year
[1:13:05] after year
[1:13:06] you know sometimes Michelangelo will
[1:13:07] just visit his work and sit down there
[1:13:10] and look at it go around it doing
[1:13:15] nothing and then he goes back just like
[1:13:21] what job said when I look back I don't
[1:13:24] see when I look forward he hide himself
[1:13:30] sometimes you don't feel God amen but
[1:13:35] you know when you don't feel God that's
[1:13:37] the time you need to work by faith
[1:13:41] just like job said he know the steps
[1:13:47] that I think he's just watching us at
[1:13:53] times we don't really fill him but his
[1:13:58] present is always there he's just
[1:14:01] watching us what she we shall do amen
[1:14:06] and so Michelangelo will just sit down
[1:14:09] and spend hours looking and he never
[1:14:13] moved and the leaps his subject and then
[1:14:18] go back again and then little by little
[1:14:20] just do a little thing because he is
[1:14:23] carefully doing things so that the thing
[1:14:28] that is in my in his mind will be
[1:14:31] transformed amen the image of Moses by
[1:14:35] the bottom said the image that was in
[1:14:37] the mind of Michelangelo he really
[1:14:40] wanted to make it real and so at the end
[1:14:43] of course this the you know we're not
[1:14:45] they were so familiar with this story
[1:14:46] but you see that's why when when when
[1:14:49] Moses finished the sculpture and he was
[1:14:57] so inspired by the venom said he was so
[1:15:00] inspired even that he took that
[1:15:04] sculpture something that is real in
[1:15:08] front of him it was his imagination was
[1:15:12] so transforming that image that he felt
[1:15:15] like Moses was really in front of him so
[1:15:22] that's why you know he was talking to
[1:15:24] this image and when he was so upset he
[1:15:28] was so disappointed he shouted speak any
[1:15:34] men and so when it was when it was done
[1:15:39] and it was finished and it was it will
[1:15:41] be displayed publicly you know and
[1:15:44] people look at it and everything look at
[1:15:47] it and you know Betty Burnham said
[1:15:48] everything every work of God must be put
[1:15:52] on display
[1:15:55] it must pass through the eyes of the
[1:16:00] critics amen before it will be placed in
[1:16:05] a Hall of Fame it must be you know the
[1:16:09] whole of critics will pass through it
[1:16:10] and and and criticize everything critic
[1:16:15] everything that they will see and
[1:16:17] remember when Bella Brennan told the
[1:16:18] story about the door amen and then in
[1:16:21] the painter painted that door so good
[1:16:24] and and and the critic said you know
[1:16:26] your painting was so good amen
[1:16:29] the color combination the Lighting's and
[1:16:33] everything you were able to put
[1:16:34] everything in there as if it is so real
[1:16:36] but I found something and you look like
[1:16:40] you forgot it
[1:16:41] what is that the painter said and he
[1:16:44] said you forgot to put a latch on it and
[1:16:48] you know only the painter and the
[1:16:51] sculptor knows what's behind it and the
[1:16:58] painter said well I did not commit a
[1:17:01] mistake that's the main thing in that
[1:17:06] painting amen because you see you don't
[1:17:10] see any opener outside because somebody
[1:17:15] someone inside will be the one to open
[1:17:18] it it's the same like the lord knocking
[1:17:24] at the door amen he's not a Gatecrasher
[1:17:31] he wants you to open up him and he can
[1:17:35] force his way through amen but he wants
[1:17:38] us to make our decision amen
[1:17:41] and so you see in the same thing when
[1:17:43] when when when Michelangelo hit that and
[1:17:46] said there was there was a of the leg of
[1:17:51] that statue amen and so that was because
[1:17:55] Amen that is what make that work so
[1:17:59] great
[1:18:00] amen but you see there is something in
[1:18:02] this that I want that I want to say amen
[1:18:05] because
[1:18:06] peace amen in paragraph 51 he said so we
[1:18:10] see that he after he made this
[1:18:11] masterpiece
[1:18:13] he plays it up here on the earth and put
[1:18:16] it in the most beautiful place there was
[1:18:18] in the Garden of Eden he plays his
[1:18:22] masterpiece the two being one in the
[1:18:25] Garden of Eden how it must have pleased
[1:18:27] him that he saw this masterpiece was
[1:18:29] well he after that we find out that he
[1:18:31] rested he was so well pleased with his
[1:18:34] work now remember by the venom said my
[1:18:39] opinion the masterpiece is the stroke
[1:18:41] that mark st. Angelo's Moses masterpiece
[1:18:45] in the monument and it was the stroke
[1:18:48] that cut the side of his masterpiece
[1:18:49] that brought out the bride so there was
[1:18:55] a slash on the side because Michelangelo
[1:19:01] hear it and he was so moved that when he
[1:19:05] when he spoke his feet and he strike it
[1:19:09] and in that portion something came out
[1:19:13] and it fell off amen so there is a mark
[1:19:22] here and something is missing and
[1:19:25] brother branham said that portion just
[1:19:30] like when when Adam you know his lap and
[1:19:35] then got caught his side and took his
[1:19:38] rib amen and that came out the woman and
[1:19:42] that woman was part of Adam and in that
[1:19:47] illustration when Moses he and or when
[1:19:51] Michelangelo he the statue of Moses a
[1:19:53] piece of that a part of that came out a
[1:19:56] man and it went wherever it is and he
[1:20:00] said that part is the bride
[1:20:04] even and now when God picks it up by his
[1:20:08] justification this is the portion just
[1:20:10] like the rim of Adam he makes the bride
[1:20:14] out of it all of it he makes the bride
[1:20:18] and his base making another masterpiece
[1:20:22] which was inside which was actually part
[1:20:25] of the original masterpiece and there is
[1:20:28] another you know I byproduct of that
[1:20:30] masterpiece and that is the bride of the
[1:20:32] Lord Jesus Christ and then so that's the
[1:20:35] same thing you know when he hears that
[1:20:37] when Michelangelo he'd better strike the
[1:20:41] statue amen
[1:20:43] you are that portion I am that portion
[1:20:47] and you know sometimes when it is a
[1:20:48] marble you know it broke into particles
[1:20:51] you know it goes around you know so just
[1:20:54] like that's why you know we get a piece
[1:20:57] you get a piece from Japan
[1:21:00] we got the piece from the Philippines we
[1:21:03] get a piece from Myanmar we get the
[1:21:05] priests from all over the world amen
[1:21:07] and that piece and then God will pick it
[1:21:09] up through the message of the hour we
[1:21:13] will hear the call of God and then and
[1:21:15] God from then on we little by little
[1:21:17] come out of it the bride of the Lord
[1:21:19] Jesus Christ amen why it's the
[1:21:22] masterpiece coming into full view so we
[1:21:28] are part we are a portion in he is our
[1:21:30] portion glory so he said now then it was
[1:21:35] the stroke that cut the size of his
[1:21:37] masterpiece that brought out the bride
[1:21:39] and now we see them as a masterpiece
[1:21:41] family in the Garden of Eden how
[1:21:43] beautiful it was and it so pleased him
[1:21:45] till he took rest then and I rest but he
[1:21:48] while he was resting and trusting to his
[1:21:50] masterpiece his enemy come and found
[1:21:52] this great masterpiece and by deceit he
[1:21:55] crawls under the garden walls and he Mar
[1:21:58] this beautiful masterpiece amen in the
[1:22:01] Garden of Eden
[1:22:03] God's Eden he made the Eden so beautiful
[1:22:06] and he placed there his masterpiece but
[1:22:10] the serpent Satan amen that Satan crawls
[1:22:13] in well God while he was resting but God
[1:22:17] knew everything
[1:22:19] amen gotten you everything
[1:22:21] hey man he began he allowed these things
[1:22:25] but God was looking at the end amen so
[1:22:31] he crawled amen
[1:22:32] and he said look what God did a man a
[1:22:34] seven crawled in God's Eden for six
[1:22:36] thousand years and and and Satan beard
[1:22:41] he's on Eden that's why the place the
[1:22:46] world that we're living in right now
[1:22:47] this is called by the prophet
[1:22:49] Satan's Eden amen
[1:22:52] Satan to the bride in the Garden of Eden
[1:22:57] hallelujah but in the last days this is
[1:23:01] Satan's Eden and then God brought again
[1:23:05] brought out his bride out of Satan's
[1:23:08] Eden to produce a masterpiece hallelujah
[1:23:12] and that is now he's making the bride
[1:23:14] for himself
[1:23:15] hallelujah in this garden and Eden you
[1:23:17] know Satan is trying to do everything to
[1:23:20] make this to make this world beautiful
[1:23:21] to make this comfortable to make this
[1:23:24] world convenient everything so that
[1:23:27] people will enjoy amen you know well you
[1:23:31] know Satan when he looks at the world
[1:23:33] when he looks at Jesus there is no
[1:23:35] beauty that he could desire on him amen
[1:23:39] and in the same manner the bride in this
[1:23:42] day no matter how Satan will make this
[1:23:45] earth this world so beautiful and
[1:23:47] convenient we cannot see any beauty in
[1:23:50] it because we're looking for another
[1:23:53] thing we're looking for the Word of God
[1:23:56] amen and God you know he's making the
[1:23:59] bride and he's he's building up building
[1:24:02] up building up a man one word and you
[1:24:05] know God we're being called by God in
[1:24:07] 4000 years after that God spoke a word
[1:24:10] to a woman right there this is my
[1:24:12] wordings the word became flesh in a
[1:24:14] virgin has conceived a man and it was
[1:24:17] without sex has had happened in the
[1:24:19] Garden of Eden amen
[1:24:21] so just right there when when when when
[1:24:24] God through that angel spoke
[1:24:26] Mary and Mary agreed and Mary believed
[1:24:29] the word of the angel is that be done to
[1:24:32] me according to your word then something
[1:24:34] happened in her womb
[1:24:36] Amen so the same spot that Satan through
[1:24:42] the serpent marred the masterpiece in
[1:24:45] the Garden of Eden when God came down he
[1:24:49] went through the spot the womb so just
[1:24:53] right there in the womb the battle is
[1:24:56] already finished the battle is already
[1:24:59] done because that seed in the woman amen
[1:25:03] the season in the Virgin holds all the
[1:25:06] potentials but I would like you I would
[1:25:09] like every one of us to see that inside
[1:25:12] that word became flesh inside of that
[1:25:16] gene is the bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:25:18] Christ himself we did not come from
[1:25:20] anything else we did not come from any
[1:25:22] denominational do we come out of there
[1:25:24] amen but we are a byproduct of that word
[1:25:28] amen
[1:25:29] that was being spoken through the stew
[1:25:31] the true truth to the Virgin Mary and it
[1:25:34] was in the word became flesh
[1:25:36] we were already part of that so that we
[1:25:41] can so in that way we cannot do
[1:25:43] otherwise because we are part of the
[1:25:45] world and so when you see the word in
[1:25:48] your day you cannot resist amen because
[1:25:52] you're part of them you can recognize it
[1:25:55] something that people don't recognize
[1:25:57] because they have not been part of it
[1:26:00] amen so you see God amen Satan took that
[1:26:04] you know and in God today in this
[1:26:06] generation God is placing his bride when
[1:26:09] we recognize who we are amen and what we
[1:26:12] are supposed to do amen
[1:26:15] and then God God's Word can be displayed
[1:26:20] through the bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:26:23] but we have to pass through all this you
[1:26:25] know God wants to accomplish something
[1:26:28] in this day and age through his bride
[1:26:32] and so that's why we realize amen we
[1:26:35] realized that you know all these things
[1:26:38] that we come true
[1:26:39] passed through it has only one purpose
[1:26:41] and that is to produce the Bride of
[1:26:45] Christ in us now let me give you example
[1:26:51] you know during the time you know
[1:26:54] remember sister Haiti right and God
[1:27:00] spoke to brother Brennan and the voice
[1:27:05] spoke to him and he said tell the woman
[1:27:08] whatever she asked for it will come to
[1:27:13] pass
[1:27:14] amen and of course we know the situation
[1:27:17] they were prevailing situation at that
[1:27:19] time there was a loved one who was sick
[1:27:23] amen
[1:27:24] and Haiti right was so poor and even the
[1:27:29] Prophet was expecting that either sister
[1:27:33] Haiti right will ask for you know
[1:27:35] bunches of dollars and brother Branham
[1:27:39] had so much confidence that the voice
[1:27:42] who spoke to him amen it will make it
[1:27:45] happen
[1:27:48] and he was expecting he said you know I
[1:27:51] was expecting that you know that that
[1:27:56] sick person will just stand up you know
[1:27:59] and jump because that was being spoken
[1:28:02] now of course it's a normal story for us
[1:28:07] but we see how a man or a woman that is
[1:28:11] fully converted by the Word of God he
[1:28:14] knows what to ask for
[1:28:19] even the reason why God has placed us in
[1:28:22] some different and hard situations
[1:28:24] because God wants us to see that when we
[1:28:28] speak we will speak the right thing and
[1:28:33] God is making the bride for him who can
[1:28:38] speak the world I think God is the one
[1:28:44] speaking it because God will speak
[1:28:46] through him or through her to the bride
[1:28:49] so God is making this bride to speak the
[1:28:53] word that God wanted to be spoken
[1:28:57] just like before the fall when Adam
[1:29:00] called all these animals all these
[1:29:02] creatures God entrusted him all these
[1:29:05] things and whatever Adam named those
[1:29:10] creatures it was the same name that God
[1:29:14] was supposed to give with those
[1:29:15] creatures and so that's why in this day
[1:29:19] and age God is making the bride so that
[1:29:22] she can speak what God wants to be
[1:29:25] spoken we're not going to speak our own
[1:29:29] but we are going to speak the words that
[1:29:32] God wants us to speak and just like this
[1:29:35] woman you know since I read the ride you
[1:29:38] know he said you know how can I say it
[1:29:40] brother branham she was so nervous and I
[1:29:47] could think you know you know can you
[1:29:50] probably this is the writer I could've
[1:29:52] told but well but when can you just do
[1:29:55] it for me you are the Prophet I trust
[1:29:58] you
[1:29:59] you can speak whatever God wants but
[1:30:01] that was not what God said the voice
[1:30:05] that spoke to brother Branham said say
[1:30:08] to that woman whatever she wants it will
[1:30:12] come to pass and that's one thing I want
[1:30:17] to leave you tonight brothers and
[1:30:19] sisters that God wants us in the end
[1:30:24] whatever whatever we pass through amen
[1:30:28] we're going to speak the same thing
[1:30:32] that God wants us to speak another that
[1:30:37] is the main purpose the main theme of
[1:30:40] God making the bride for him because we
[1:30:45] are his representative amen
[1:30:49] so you see now then Amen so he said
[1:30:52] brother Branham how can I do it just
[1:30:55] speak the word you know the right spoke
[1:30:59] the right thing
[1:31:00] amen of course
[1:31:03] healing we still believe in healing we
[1:31:06] still pray for sick people
[1:31:07] amen you know even in my country even in
[1:31:10] my church there was I remember a sister
[1:31:16] and it happened to be she's my
[1:31:17] sister-in-law and you know he went she
[1:31:20] went to the hospital and the doctors
[1:31:24] told her that you know there you have a
[1:31:27] tumor and that tumor needs needs a
[1:31:32] surgery to be taken out of you
[1:31:35] and so she went home that was Friday to
[1:31:43] pack up and prepare for the surgery the
[1:31:45] following week but sunday came and we
[1:31:48] prayed amen and you know the prayer
[1:31:53] request was was given and we had a
[1:31:56] little mezzanine back there and she was
[1:31:58] she was upstairs and you know the pelt I
[1:32:01] just felt led to call her to downstairs
[1:32:04] and we prayed amen
[1:32:07] and so that was a Sunday and that same
[1:32:10] Sunday evening we brought her to the
[1:32:12] hospital because Monday that was the
[1:32:14] scheduled surgery but before she went to
[1:32:17] this to the surgery they checked
[1:32:20] everything and they were surprised amen
[1:32:27] the examined him repeatedly and the
[1:32:32] doctor said where did you put that tumor
[1:32:45] here's the same guy
[1:32:49] amen because God as he's making the
[1:32:52] bride God is building up building up our
[1:32:55] confidence in him not on our own but our
[1:32:59] confidence in him just like job he
[1:33:02] knoweth the road they men the path that
[1:33:06] I'm going to take when he tried me he
[1:33:09] knows that in the end I shall comport as
[1:33:11] gold amen
[1:33:14] so we can speak the right thing if we
[1:33:17] have that kind of revelation and we have
[1:33:19] confidence in him hallelujah
[1:33:21] and so you see where did you put those
[1:33:23] tumor it's gone you know there is a a
[1:33:30] medical medical proof that that tumor
[1:33:33] was just right there
[1:33:35] three days ago amen she's the same God
[1:33:41] today all right
[1:33:44] but anyway so since the red light was
[1:33:46] placed right there he she believed that
[1:33:48] God can do he can heal her loved one
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:51] God you know now that confidence you
[1:33:55] know they just speak the properties is
[1:33:58] there to bring the confidence to bring
[1:34:00] up the confidence in the level but Haiti
[1:34:03] right can speak the world and so Haiti
[1:34:09] right spoke the right thing amen
[1:34:12] not money amen not but did she didn't
[1:34:17] believe but she asked for something that
[1:34:19] is greater
[1:34:23] amen and this is a burden brothers and
[1:34:27] sisters that today brother Branham said
[1:34:33] it's not fair that we have heard this
[1:34:36] message quite a number of times but
[1:34:39] there are people out there in other
[1:34:43] parts of the world that have not heard
[1:34:45] this message not even a single one
[1:34:49] single time we have a responsibility
[1:34:53] amen we have the responsibility and like
[1:34:57] Haiti right amen
[1:34:58] I believe she represents the picture of
[1:35:02] a bride to the fullest that she can
[1:35:05] speak the right thing and have passion
[1:35:07] for the salvation of the souls of her
[1:35:10] children
[1:35:11] amen and see you see the burden of
[1:35:15] sister hey Tara you know the heart of
[1:35:17] sister Nettie right you know so no
[1:35:19] wonder they were building and you know
[1:35:23] the what you call this the trustees are
[1:35:28] so afraid and they're so against that a
[1:35:32] poor woman like Haiti right should put
[1:35:34] in something for the building fund and
[1:35:40] the brother wanted to return part of it
[1:35:43] and brother branham said I wanted to
[1:35:44] return the other part but the Holy
[1:35:50] Spirit spoke to him amen so sometimes we
[1:35:54] do things just like sister hatred
[1:35:56] because he she had passion for soul amen
[1:36:00] she gave something that even hurts her
[1:36:03] she was so poor and yet she could give
[1:36:07] something for the cost of the word amen
[1:36:13] and that's the position that we are in
[1:36:17] right now
[1:36:17] we're so tired of this world I'm tired
[1:36:22] brother Craig amen but I'm not giving up
[1:36:28] when I say I'm tired I'm not saying I'm
[1:36:30] giving up amen but I'm tired but I will
[1:36:34] keep on pushing amen
[1:36:39] spreading this endtime gospel to the
[1:36:41] needy amen because that is the main
[1:36:44] purpose for us to see and find that last
[1:36:48] predestinated scene amen and he said you
[1:36:51] know he said he said he look around and
[1:36:54] all around and she said brother bill my
[1:36:56] greatest desire is for the salvation of
[1:36:59] my two boys and that tells a lot and I
[1:37:03] believe we have the Prophet on the scene
[1:37:06] he
[1:37:07] for and I was off the scene but he said
[1:37:10] you know I see some kind of a scene
[1:37:14] there that here comes the Prophet and he
[1:37:17] is
[1:37:18] he was elevating the fate of the woman
[1:37:23] just like the bride today this message
[1:37:26] of the hour
[1:37:28] Amon is lifting up our fate amen
[1:37:32] to a seventeen to a certain level
[1:37:37] brother Branham said even he said now we
[1:37:40] are he said I believe that the Church of
[1:37:43] the Living God is moving into a sphere
[1:37:46] now amen
[1:37:49] well we're moving up into a certain
[1:37:52] sphere now amen
[1:37:54] that you know little by little were
[1:37:57] fulfilling God's Commission amen that
[1:38:00] God has entrusted to what he said I
[1:38:02] believe that the Church of the Living
[1:38:03] God is moving into spirit now that's God
[1:38:06] is going to shake the whole world that's
[1:38:09] the first time it's been since the days
[1:38:11] of Jesus of Nazareth a human being as
[1:38:13] anything that you will and it shall be
[1:38:15] given unto you anything you desire don't
[1:38:18] you see the words of Jesus Christ being
[1:38:19] fulfilled oh it's going to come to pass
[1:38:22] pretty soon I'm looking for it to happen
[1:38:24] in this meeting I'm wanting it to happen
[1:38:26] now that the anointing will strike the
[1:38:28] whole Church of the Living God and she
[1:38:31] will rise to her feet like a mighty
[1:38:33] marching army the seek will be healed by
[1:38:36] a word the blind will see the Deaf will
[1:38:40] hear the Dead will be raised up and the
[1:38:42] power of God will shake the world with
[1:38:44] the Church of the Living God we're in
[1:38:47] the process of it now I believe it's
[1:38:50] coming soon to pass I believe it will be
[1:38:52] just exactly that way I believe it's
[1:38:55] going to strike the Church of God soon
[1:38:56] and it's going to start a revival that
[1:38:59] shake the world amen
[1:39:01] and he said I believe it
[1:39:03] lujah and he said that you know you know
[1:39:05] he's on that long time ago amen but i
[1:39:08] believe we're actually in that sphere
[1:39:10] now we are in such a rearm where where
[1:39:13] the bride can speak the mind of God amen
[1:39:18] and things even we will be placed in
[1:39:22] such a condition that God will you know
[1:39:25] we will put our full confidence in God
[1:39:28] and we can speak things and it will
[1:39:33] happen not that we are God we're not
[1:39:39] we're not taking the position of the
[1:39:41] bridegroom weary we will remain the
[1:39:43] bride amen but as brother Branham put
[1:39:50] his trust into a simple woman like Haiti
[1:39:54] right to speak the thing that she wanted
[1:40:00] and it came to pass
[1:40:02] amen so I believe were in that condition
[1:40:05] we're in that position so God is moving
[1:40:07] up lifting and lifting up our faith and
[1:40:11] he said we're moving into that sphere
[1:40:13] we're moving we're entering into that
[1:40:15] cycle amen and that's the main purpose
[1:40:20] of this message of the hour amen Bourbon
[1:40:22] am Himself said you know the messengers
[1:40:25] are but example of the aides that they
[1:40:29] are living in amen
[1:40:31] so if brother Branham is just an example
[1:40:34] if he spoke the squirrel into existence
[1:40:38] because God told him to speak about it
[1:40:42] and then if that little tiny fish
[1:40:45] without any internal organs amen
[1:40:48] could swim back again into life and then
[1:40:52] through the to the mark of the prophet
[1:40:54] and in a prophet in the age is but an
[1:40:57] example for that age what about us
[1:41:01] hallelujah so all these things all these
[1:41:04] things that are going on and in a live 7
[1:41:08] in her age today is just building and
[1:41:10] building her faith until God a man will
[1:41:13] make up hallelujah the full
[1:41:15] manifestation of the bride in action
[1:41:19] in this generation hallelujah amen so
[1:41:23] you see now I mean it happened before
[1:41:25] and let me close with this thing when
[1:41:28] when Abraham was called by God amen to
[1:41:32] offer Isaac you know Abraham did not
[1:41:39] look in between he believed God he
[1:41:46] trusts God amen
[1:41:49] but his mind was limited that even if he
[1:41:53] killed his own son God is able to raise
[1:41:57] him up amen
[1:42:01] but we know that something had happened
[1:42:03] beyond Abraham's expectation amen but
[1:42:07] because of Abraham's trust and
[1:42:09] confidence upon God something great
[1:42:12] beyond his expectation happened
[1:42:16] hallelujah so you know he was willing to
[1:42:19] to sacrifice his own son he was willing
[1:42:22] to to give his own son kill him as an
[1:42:26] offering amen
[1:42:28] but but you know what in the Old
[1:42:31] Testament you know although those those
[1:42:34] are ridiculous all these animals that
[1:42:38] have been killed they just covered since
[1:42:40] they did not wash sin amen and it never
[1:42:45] happened you know if there is any man in
[1:42:48] the time of Abraham that will kill their
[1:42:53] child to be offered only pagans can do
[1:42:58] that heathens can only do that but look
[1:43:04] at Abraham God required him to do
[1:43:08] something like pagans were doing
[1:43:15] that was not supposed to be done and
[1:43:18] believers Heaton's can kill their
[1:43:23] children and offer it to their gods but
[1:43:27] God required Abraham to do something and
[1:43:31] deep Rahab did not question God it isn't
[1:43:37] I'm not the pagan I'm a believer why
[1:43:41] should they do things something beyond
[1:43:46] what I am supposed to do he'd never
[1:43:48] questioned God but he trusted God so
[1:43:51] much amen and so Abraham was just right
[1:43:54] there and he was about to be laid on the
[1:43:58] altar and you know just like Jesus
[1:44:00] you know nobody pours him He gave His
[1:44:02] life and brother Branham said the same
[1:44:05] thing with Isaac he never resisted when
[1:44:07] he saw Amen but you know father here is
[1:44:11] the here is the altar here is the
[1:44:13] firewood but where is the sacrifice and
[1:44:19] Abraham spoke the word and he said the
[1:44:25] word shall prove that the Lord shall
[1:44:28] provide himself a sacrifice amen and let
[1:44:32] me close with that and he said you see
[1:44:42] so when Abraham did that isn't it man
[1:44:44] you see and that when he said when the
[1:44:48] question was brought up about Jehovah
[1:44:50] Jireh she said that's nothing but the
[1:44:52] truth amen and this is about Caesar
[1:44:56] happy right but when it comes to Abraham
[1:44:58] and he said when he spoke the things the
[1:45:01] Lord shall provide a sacrifice for
[1:45:03] himself suddenly there was a ram but one
[1:45:11] is a where did it come from
[1:45:12] yes you know you can look around and you
[1:45:15] see it's bear you know no Ram will come
[1:45:22] to that place where did it come from
[1:45:26] it come it was the first spoken word
[1:45:33] spoken by a man of God Abraham when he
[1:45:39] said the Lord shall provide himself a
[1:45:42] sacrifice
[1:45:43] Amen brother branham said you know it
[1:45:46] came into existence because a prophet
[1:45:51] spoke of it and it was just so natural
[1:45:53] because Abraham had so much confidence
[1:45:57] in God that he could speak things
[1:46:00] naturally and it came to pass it
[1:46:03] happened and it happened to brother
[1:46:05] Branham he said you know it was it
[1:46:07] wasn't a vision I shoot it I killed that
[1:46:12] squirrel and not only that I ate it amen
[1:46:18] so they're just examples in this age
[1:46:21] look what God is making up the bride
[1:46:25] look what direction we are going one of
[1:46:30] the direction we're heading for if we
[1:46:32] just put every confidence in God that
[1:46:36] whatever happens in our lives God has
[1:46:39] something to do with it it is his will
[1:46:42] and it is needful hallelujah as I :
[1:46:47] brother Timothy amen you know you just
[1:46:51] you just pray for us pray for brother
[1:46:53] Danny

[1:47:12] they were just scattered in different
[1:47:14] places
[1:47:15] but through this message of the hour God
[1:47:17] will magnetize them and bring them in
[1:47:20] and out of them will produce God will
[1:47:22] make the bride out of it let's all stand
[1:47:25] up as I call inverted Timothy amen god

[1:59:42] man well let's be seated for a moment
[1:59:45] amen this concludes our service for
[1:59:48] tonight but I just want to speak to you
[1:59:50] about our building project that we got
[1:59:53] going on out there in the activity
[1:59:56] building for our youth and in fellowship
[1:59:58] building we was able this week to pour
[2:00:01] some concrete around the outside for
[2:00:03] sidewalks and and also a porch area
[2:00:06] that'll be built but this weekend we'd
[2:00:09] like to do a another work day to try to
[2:00:11] get this the inside ready for sheetrock
[2:00:14] in the next couple of weeks or in the
[2:00:16] next few days actually and so we'd like
[2:00:20] to get some painting to do get some
[2:00:23] framing finished frame to finish all the
[2:00:25] framing that's left to do they think
[2:00:28] there's some framing to do in the men's
[2:00:30] restroom and also just a lot of loose
[2:00:32] ends that need to be tied up and and
[2:00:34] bundled up there and gotten ready and
[2:00:37] also so cleaned up and things that needs
[2:00:40] to take place I'm sure I'm forgetting a
[2:00:43] few things it's on the list but there's
[2:00:45] plenty to do and I believe if we can get
[2:00:47] enough folks we can finish it up in just
[2:00:49] a little bit and it'll be ready for
[2:00:51] sheetrock and we can turn the sheet
[2:00:55] rockers loose to get that done we'd like
[2:00:57] to try our best to get this building as
[2:01:00] operative all as possible I don't know
[2:01:03] how much that how much we'll be able to
[2:01:05] be as far as Fire Marshal's concerned
[2:01:09] and all that but at least get it to
[2:01:11] where we can use it for our have it open
[2:01:14] because we do have a/c in there as you
[2:01:15] know when things and we use it for our
[2:01:17] meetings for the young people to be able
[2:01:19] to do things and and all of that but I'd
[2:01:22] like to get as close as possible so
[2:01:24] we're gonna push this next month to try
[2:01:26] to finish it up and try to get it ready
[2:01:29] and open for our meetings so if you
[2:01:31] could young people especially there's a
[2:01:34] lot to do for you this is your building
[2:01:35] and then also any brothers that can help
[2:01:39] and even sisters with painting there's
[2:01:41] like I said there's plenty to do and
[2:01:42] more we got the less time it will take
[2:01:44] so if you could we sure appreciate it if
[2:01:47] you could come Saturday Saturday morning
[2:01:50] we start about eight o'clock if you
[2:01:52] don't
[2:01:52] get there earlier that's fine with me
[2:01:54] but let's get a starting time to get it
[2:01:56] going there's also something else that's
[2:01:58] going on that you won't see Saturday but
[2:02:01] brother mark and brother James and by
[2:02:03] the Darrell different ones would be
[2:02:05] working on the outside you know if
[2:02:07] you'll notice when you go out there
[2:02:08] there's a pretty good sized concrete
[2:02:10] slab on the outside south of the
[2:02:12] building that's going to be for a porch
[2:02:14] and attached to that it's going to be
[2:02:16] our playground for the kids and out of
[2:02:19] that it's going to rise a balcony pretty
[2:02:22] much or a second-floor up there for
[2:02:25] basically a porch but if we had to put
[2:02:27] it outside exit to appease the fire
[2:02:29] marshals so we're just making it to
[2:02:31] where it'll also help us out and give us
[2:02:33] more enjoyment and so we're making it
[2:02:36] into a porch upstairs and downstairs so
[2:02:39] plenty of places to hang out and joy and
[2:02:41] have fellowship together that's what
[2:02:43] it's all about so anyway we're gonna try
[2:02:46] to push and get get as much done as
[2:02:48] possible to get in this building to get
[2:02:50] it operable so we can start and join it
[2:02:53] and it'd take a lot of I know I know
[2:02:54] with this building being open it'll take
[2:02:56] a lot of pressure off of the different
[2:02:58] homes it's open so wonderful to open up
[2:03:01] and let our young people come to and but
[2:03:04] this whole this whole piece or help some
[2:03:06] of that so if you could if you can come
