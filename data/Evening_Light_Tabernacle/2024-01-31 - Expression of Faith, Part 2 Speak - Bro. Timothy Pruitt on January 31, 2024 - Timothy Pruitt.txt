each one if you want to lift your hands as brother Joe comes Amen to the Lord amen before we bow our heads in prayer just to kind of give you a brief update of this weekend I went to uh St maros California there at an all Mexican church Spanish speaking working through an interpreter and I had arrived on Thursday and realized I was preaching Thursday night uh along with several other services for their special annual meetings brother Jonathan Suarez the brother that was here with us a month or so ago kind of put these meetings together and Sunday morning after the service the presence of the Lord just dropped down in a very special way uh in the services there was many that came for prayers seeking the Holy Ghost deliverance from addictions young people coming giving their hearts to the Lord seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Lord just poured out wave after wave after wave on the people I was there for maybe an hour praying with the uh different ones and working through an interpreter brother Elias from Phoenix and then I went to the back just to kind of rest and you know thinking service was over he comes knocks on the door and says there's other people that need prayer and we go back out we pray again for another 45 minutes for the people and brother Johnson said he said brother Joe these meetings this weekend was historic he says we've hadn't had a move of God like that in many many many many many many years and one of the brothers that came up at the end of it and and I'll be brief he said look he said brother he said brother Joe he said you answered all my questions today' so Jonathan told me he said when he pulled up to in the parking lot of the church he was going to drop his family off and leave cuz he said if this is all that there is to this message if there all there is to the ministry he goes what's the purpose what's the use but he saw a display in the manifestation of the Holy Spirit and God came down and discerned his own heart when he came up for prayer discerned his family and the presence of God just fell and moved on the people and he said now I know there's more out there he said you answered all my questions things that we take for granted but yet this is a part of you going out there as well when we go out on the field we're taking even light Tabernacle your prayers are praying for us is touching and meeting needs in the body and there's needs in the body tonight different ones that are spir uh physical needs or spiritual needs so I would just ask you continue to remember the Believers there in

fulfilled according to what thou has said Lord we're so thankful you never leave us Lord we're so thankful you're there with us Lord moving Upon Our Hearts and lives we ask God you bless your children tonight Lord bless us around your word we pray in Jesus name amen amen reminds me of a quote that I read this week said Jesus Christ stood alone in his day as an example to every man upon his convictions of God's Eternal truth truth that will take a stand positionally and stand we stand alone but not alone with God Amen the invisible companion who follows us through life's journey down through the Shadows of the Valley of the shadow of death and on into eternity he will go with us and be God hallelujah I'm thankful to serve him today amen amen you're happy to be in the house of the Lord turn our Bibles to Mark chap 11 also Revelations 10 if you would amen we got a lot of needs but we have a great God for our needs amen just ask you to be even I haven't said much about it maybe a few times but praying for us with us about sister Ruth's um trial thing we're in right now with her and her body they found a some type of they call it a tumor or a nodule right there in the top of her skull or somewhere in that area and the doctors are wanting to do surgery and so we're going to maybe have a consultation with him about that but we're just depending on our God because he has the final say amen and so just be in prayer about that the Lord will lead us in the right path in the right direction amen amen cuz he'll go with us no matter where and be God Amen Mark 11:22 and Jesus answered said un them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that what whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them also Revelations 10 and verse 8 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people Nations and tongues and Kings amen we let you be seated I'd like to speak to you again on the expression of faith um last week we spoke on praise this this week we'll speak on on speak amen your voice speaking the word of God is an expression of faith we we read in our scripture tonight in the previous verses we could read about Jesus as he went to the found the fig tree that had no fruit and he said no man eateth from thee and then after this verse they came and they saw that it had withered away and and Peter brought this to to their attention and he said you know if and then Jesus would say as we read if you say to this mountain be moved he notice he did not say if I say he said if you say if you say to this mountain be moved and we know that man could not move a mountain just by speaking to it on his own accord or his own ability me as a man I could not do that the only thing that can move a mountain would be deity amen deity so then if a mountain is before us and our objective is right and our motive is right and we speak the word of God it isn't us speaking anymore it's deity speaking then when deity speaks it has to move amen notice he didn't put a time frame in that he didn't he didn't put it say that you know it would move in the next five minutes or the next 5 years time means nothing to God time only means something to more the people that are mortal amen time means nothing to someone that's Immortal and so he did not put a time frame on it we like we like time frames we like to know schedules or or or when it might happen but it has not that has nothing to do with it he said you speak and it'll happen amen it doesn't matter if it's in the next five minutes or the next 5 years or the next 50 years matters not amen a amen as you speak you must believe and then as you speak the sand of that mountain begins to move he said I truly believe believe that the church is on the brink of one of the greatest outpourings it's ever had in this age I believe it I can't say the Lord has told me but something inside of me is just catching a hold of something that I haven't seen in all my life till just now and how glory is to know just before the coming of the Lord that these things are happening amen Faith you know is so simple he says the scripture says faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen in other words faith is not a myth it's not a hop so it's not a maybe it's something that you actually possess he said just like this and he uses that illustration he used many times about the quarter he says if I was starving and you came to me and said brother brandom I'm starving or I said I said I'm starving he said what well you what would save your life and I'd say maybe a loaf of bread and you'd go into your pocket and bring out 25 cents and hand it to me and say here you are Mr brandom you don't have to starve he said now I haven't got the bread yet but I've got the purchased power of the bread and that's exactly what faith is it may not may not be that it's actually in your hands as far as the evidence of what you can see amen but it is a purchased power that by his stripes I'm healed amen it's already done because his word says it is amen and he says see it's a purchased power of the bread I might be a mile from the bread or we might say it like this I might be five minutes from my healing or 5 Years From My healing or however long it is I can be just as happy with that quarter or that faith in my hand I can be when I got the bread in my when I have the bread in my hand because I've got the purchased power of the bread and he said when that faith is anchored that is finished you can just be as happy as you were amen if you was already healed and already you can jump about it you can shout about it cuz it's already over with amen you can have it it's already done it's something you know you've got nothing can move it from you you can never you'll never watch for any evidence or anything else you'll just know that you have it and he said when I got this bread or this 25 cents I may have to go over some heels I may have to go through some Brier patches I may have to go across some water I may have to cross Bridges but all the time I'm rejoicing cuz I've got the 25 cents amen so rejoice joing and Faith goes together amen uh and speaking the word of God Amen we're not here to speak of our own accord or our own mind or our own thoughts about things amen we are here to speak the word of God because what I speak can fail what I speak can fall to the ground what I speak may not come to pass but what he says will not fail what he says will not fall to the ground what he says will come to pass amen so we can be rejoicing and thankful that what he said in his word you say I don't know if it's his will to heal well his word is his will so if it's in his word it is his will to heal therefore we can rejoice and thank God for our healing before it even happens hallelujah amen whatever it's in his word we can take it and believe it and rejoice about it he said most people have faith let me go back he said I might have to cross some bridges but all the time I'm rejoicing because I've got the 25 cents knowing I'm going to get bread just as soon as I get there it's the purchasing power well faith is the purchase power of things you have hoped for Hallelujah faith is the purchase power of things you're hop for that is genuine faith and nothing can move it he says most people have faith but they don't try to use what faith they've got am man you can have 25 cents but if you don't go now I understand the they Bread's way more than 25 but whatever it is $2.50 or $3.50 if you don't you can have it in your pocket all day long but if you don't slap it down on the counter and buy you a loaf of bread it'll never come to pass amen you got to put it into action amen you got to speak the word of God and this is what he said you got to have he said most people have faith but they don't try to use the faith they got he said I believe that every person that believes on the Lord Jesus Christ how many people believe on has a certain amount of Faith the reason that it's never used too much is because you never put it to use very much yeah okay and person a person usually coming to church will just come in listen to a sermon then they'll go up put their name on a church book become a good member of that church that's just about as far as they have ever had and the opportunity to use their faith faith will do just anything that you have need of being done if you'll put it to work amen faith will just do anything that you have need of being done if you'll put it to work but most churches today they got just as far as they can teach and that's just accept Jesus by faith and that's all to it that settles it that's like a man who was eating a slice of watermelon he said that was good but there's some more of it somewhere Hallelujah I believe we ought not ever get settled and satisfied in our work with God it ain't just believing on him and that's all there is to it there's more to this watermelon there's more to the slices that we can have amen there's more of what God has in store for his children he said he said when man accepts Christ as his personal savior then all the good things that God has promised is laying right there at his fingertips it's not way off somewhere and something hard to obtain it's right here at our fingertips just believe it don't go at it in a place where I wonder for the work just the same as you know you're going to get up and you need a drink of water so you're going to raise up and you're going to walk across the floor and you're going to get that drink of water that's just how simple it is when the Lord promised it that's all that settles it and just going about it that's real genuine Faith Hallelujah if a if people would if the church would put more faith to work you'll see more things take place in the church the pastor might stand on a Sunday morning he might stand on a Sunday evening or a Wednesday whatever preach hard on faith in a mighty message but if the members don't take that message and start putting it to work it'll fall right back again and the birds of the air will pick it up but just take it out and put it at work God want you to do that God wants you to to do that see he came in flesh 2,000 years ago he came to overcome the devil in every way and we can say man he did in sicknesses he overcame him in sin he overcame him in death he overcame him but his desire was for more than one body doing his Works amen he wanted more than one body destroying the works of the devil he wanted deity not just in one body but in many in a many membered body amen overcoming as he did overcoming him against sin as he overcame sin overcoming sickness as he overcame sickness The Works that I do shall you do also even greater than this and we want to know what the prophet taught on that he taught it wasn't greater that it's a greater Miracle he said it really the translation is more because it's not just one body no more it's a multi-member body all over the world Hallelujah just we just got a report from brother Danny del mundo going to a far outreaching Island there at the Philippines it's like five five hours by car and two hours by boat and he hears about a woman who' been struck down in her body by a stroke and she's laying there in a bed and and there he's asked to go pray for her he goes in and he lays hands as the Bible says Mark 16 is what he quoted laid hands upon the sick and he said she sat up in bed and God done a miracle in her life right there amen and he said have done such a miracle her daughter they wouldn't even believer her her daughter had seen that miracle and said I must know this Jesus Christ and she was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what was it it was putting faith into action it ain't up to me to fulfill it it's up to me to do what he said [Music] do it's he wanted more than one body he wanted a many membered body he wanted it in the Philippines he wanted it in Japan he wanted in Africa he wanted in Europe he wanted it all over the world deity defeating Satan's kingdom he said some people think of him back there as deity as a little baby he was the one that stood on the invisible platform and he reached out his hands and spoke and said said let there be light and there was light he said that was Jesus Christ for he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world recognized him not he was and he is the deity of God look what he did back there talk about the miraculous back there talk about shouting when he performed the miraculous things to make things which are now out of things which was not he spoke it and it was so and that same power that same Christ he said let the fundamentalist let them people who deny the power of God say it's wrong but the same power that spoke the world in existence is in the people that's got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah the same created Power that spoke this world into existence that same deity is not 2,000 years ago it's not somewhere in the wild blue yonder it's on Earth today that's right men and women it's time we found out who we are I think this is very amazing this is the very first sermon recorded the deity of Jesus Christ 1949 1225 of 1949 the very first sermon God is wanting us to hear who we are he's wanting to tell you amen the devil's trying to hide you back somewhere and tell you you're some little trotten down something you're not come on now you're made worthy by the blood of Jesus Christ your sons and daughters of God deity is not in heaven it's in you right there at the very first recorded sermon God is wanting us to know who we are that deity is not just 2,000 years ago or in heaven somewhere deity is on Earth and is doing the same works that he [Applause] did God he said I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that almighty God Lives in You Boo devil almighty God lives in you immortal life my life I give Zoe the life of God is in human beings again he stood back there he the creator of all things he made the life he made frogs he made Ducks chicken animals creat everything nothing was made but what was made by him who Christ a deity he brought down plagues and everything in the days of Egypt who Christ he stopped the mouth of lions he quenched the violence of fire they escaped the edge of the sword they raised the Dead from the grave who Christ oh my what would it be who is it Christ and brother and sister that deity is in you the same power that stoed the lion's mouth the same power that quenched the violence of fire the same power that raised up Jesus from the dead now also quickens your mortal body Christ in the manger no a little while in the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age why did he not leave you when you was in your doubts why did he not leave you when you was in your frustrations because he was held to you by his word to deny you he had to deny his word and he wasn't going to do that amen cuz that's who you are Christ in the manger no Christ in you hallelujah we're not worshiping Christ in the manger but Christ in you the Holy Ghost the hope of Life The Creator God himself dwelling again in humanity so another place he said if your life tallies up to the life of Jesus Christ in other words that same Spirit lives in you the Holy Ghost he said in his word if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe that it's coming to pass you can have what you say what you say what you say the only way you can move that mountain would be have deity speaking when you're a Son of God you receive God which is zoy God's own life and you become part of God then if your objective right and your motive is right speak and watch what happened it has to take place it may not be on your time frame or the time that you want it done but that's not up to me amen it ain't up to me to fulfill the word of God it's up to me to speak the word of God it's up to me to speak what he said and then he'll do what he does amen God wants somebody who believe he said the word comes into you if the holy spirit is there there it'll make it alive as soon as it comes in and every promise is true therefore if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart because what you are deity speaking you are deity speaking you believe it the Bible said so whatsoever you shall come and shall whatsoever you say shall come to pass if you're not doubt it if you can get all the world bread out of here and let the Holy Spirit make you a full son or daughter no world no condemnation no doubt what is it then it's no more you it's God in you then you take his word it's a promise and say father it's your promise something's got to move of course you can't do it until God has revealed to you that that's a case should be amen when you know that the case shall be then you can say like Jesus he was is the word is that right yet Jesus the man the Tabernacle said I do nothing except the father show me first if it's not then it it is not the word then until it's made manifest to you you get it no wonder people say days of Miracles are passed why they say that cuz the word isn't manifest to them but you can't tell me days or Miracles are pass cuz that word's been made manifest to me amen I've seen it no wonder they can't believe in the holy spirit cuz the word's not made manifest to them no wonder they can't see the revelation of the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ cuz the word isn't manifest to them yet and yet they don't have one scripture there's no place where anybody was ever baptized any other way amen about the Holy Ghost the Bible said no man can call Jesus to Christ only by the Holy Ghost and people say they don't believe in the Holy Ghost is right see that's not made to them it's not been made manifest to them Jesus said no man can come to me except the father draw isn't that beautiful all the father has given me will come and I'll raise him up again at the last day oh my there's where our names are put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world how could we ever doubt oh God take the doubt from Among Us take the doubt from Among Us circumcise our poor human hearts there there's no more doubt Among Us that's my prayer roll away every doubt [Applause] let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus roll away the doubt in John 5 and verse4 we're told this this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything in his will he heareth us amen you know it's hard to believe somebody's got confidence in you if they're questioning everything you do amen God it's hard for God to believe we got confidence in him if we're questioning everything he does but if we truly believe he's in control then we don't question him then we can have confidence that we have to have this confidence that if we ask anything according to his will his will is what his word according to his will he heareth us amen so if we ask to be healed he heareth us if we ask to be filled with the Holy Ghost he heareth us it's his word therefore it's his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desire of him Hallelujah now here he goes now we ask what is the will of God there is only one way to know his will and that's by the word so if we're asking for things outside of the word then it's not his will amen you know I I you know people come up this idea well it was it was my will to marry that woman and she's divorced woman how could it be his will if it ain't in his word I don't care how many angels you had talked to you I don't care how many dreams you've had I don't care how many quotes you can find it's not in his word therefore it cannot be his will there it is if it's not in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name there it is again Jesus the name is the word will you can't separate God and the word they are one then this word he's left behind us on printed page is a part of him when you accepted by faith into a spirit filled life not into an intellectual conception but a spirit filled life he said that his word was life in John 3 663 that's exactly what he is in John 14:6 he said I am the way the truth and the life Romans 88:9 said If any man have not the spirit of Christ he's none of his there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is spirit and life amen that's exactly what the word is that's exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places upon his lips why it's the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man no wonder he don't want you to know who you are no wonder he don't want you to know you're a blood bought Holy Ghost filled Son of God and he's constantly trying to question your life and constantly trying to make you some think you some trotting down something cuz he knows if you ever get the revelation of who you are he cannot stand before you but he will be just as defeated and thwarted against you as he was 2,000 years ago cuz it's the same life and it's the same power therefore he had the same effects but if he keep if he can keep some condemnation on you if he can keep you down in about something or some questions then he knows he can stand there but if you ever realize who you really are Satan can't stand before that amen Revelations 1:7 and 18 says when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not I am the first and the last time he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death he said no human being could stand the effect of that Vision John's strength was utterly Gone John fell at his feet as though dead but the hand of the Lord in love touched him and the voice of blessing said fear not don't be afraid I am the first and last I am he that liveth was dead behold I'm alive forever more what what is there to fear judgment that fell on him at at the cross at the grave and when he descended was for us it was for me and he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin and there is therefore now no condemnation no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus hallelujah amen see for assurity our eternity is our judge he is both eternity and judge and his judge he says case is finished it is settled it is thrown out of court hall hallelujah he tells the devil you brought the wrong one in this time that's my son there and I have already paid the price for his sin it's finished it's dismissed it's over with what kind of power would we realize we would have if there's no condemnation what kind of services could we have if all condemnation was stripped off of us and we realize hey that's not who I am devil I'm a Son of God I came from God I'm going back to God why should the church fear what promise has he ever failed fail to manifest before us now you can go into the trial I was reading it today I ain't got at my notes but you can go into the trial and one of the worst worst cases that comes up is Mr impatient impatient you know we as humans especially in this time we living in we more impatient than ever that's right I mean think about but I I just thinking about this my trip I just got back from uh from uh going to Africa and Europe got into uh I got into uh Charles deal there and my plane was delayed you know what it did late enough that I was going to miss my connection in Atlanta had a good connection Bo I was proud of that connection I was going to get home early missed my connection had to wait another 4 and 1/2 hours oh yeah and patience comes along and but if I had just lived a few hundred years ago it had took me a whole lot longer than what I just did I mean I spent 40 hours all together going to Africa and coming back in an airplane but I promise you a couple hundred years ago it it took me a whole lot longer than 40 hours but we're now living in a time that we want everything right now and God forbid something disrupt it and get in our way and we want to get all anxious and impatient but listen God's trying to teach us something and when it comes to his promises it's on his [Applause] time and when it's time to be F fulfilled when it's time it will not be no delay Hallelujah there won't be no delay there won't be nothing stop it there won't be nothing hinder when it's time to come to fulfillment it will be fulfilled so do we trust him quite a question he asked brother Ron or said to brother Ron if you trust me I'll use you like never before oh God I trust you I didn't know it was going to be that that's not being brother Ron's attitude by no strength but that's the way we are sometimes Lord I trust you God next thing we know we're going through a trial man I'll be glad when I get out of this one I'm sick of this thing how impatient that we just get a few days ago when it rained for four or five days in a row I can't wait till this rain gets up with I'm so sick of it Meanwhile we're behind on our rainfall and we're needing a rain and we're fussing hey I'm just as guilty as anybody else I get sick of it but we need it it's a needful thing we got to have it so are trials they're not easy and they're sometimes very hard and very difficult but they're needed yes how would you know him as a savior if you never sin how would you know him as a Healer if you never had sickness how would you know him as a deliverer if you never was bound but God wanted you to know him in every attribute and he said if you'll trust me I'll lead you through this I'll never leave you I'll be right with you matter of fact you'll look back and see one set of footprints like oh yeah he left me no that's when he picked you up and he carried you hallelujah oh my how many times has he done that for us just picks us up when we get through across some of them Bridges brother BR talk some of them Brier patches we couldn't make it but we're still praising God anyhow and we run out of our own strength and he says all right child I got you and he picks you up and he carries you through Hallelujah but the there is now therefore no condemnation why should the church fear what promise has he ever failed to manifest before us why should I fear punishment or death it's all been overcome he's the mighty conqueror he's the one who conquered both the worlds of the seen and the Unseen not like Al Alexander or Napoleon who conquered this and this but finally Was Defeated this this this was there was nothing that could conquer Christ he that descended is now ascended and unto him has been given the name that is above every name yes he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave and he has the keys thereof and whatever he loses is loose and whatever rebounds is bound and there's no change in there there's no conquer before him and there's none beside him he alone is savior I'm talking about your God tonight he alone is savior he alone is Redeemer he's the only God the Lord Jesus Christ is his name and it goes right into this don't fear John Don't Fear Little Flock all that I am you're air to all my power is yours my nness is yours as I stand in your midst I have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it's yours to use you speak the word and I'll perform it this is my Covenant and it will never [Applause] fail that's right yes sir when a man sinned when man sinned at the beginning he crossed a great Chasm there was a Chasm between him and God leaving no way back God took a substitute heard about it someone Sunday offered a substitute and he accepted that substitute if a man would accept the substitute for his place then he could come back in fellowship with God and then man for years went about through the blood of bulls and goats sheeps and animals but it would never take away the sin it only covered the sin he said that's what's happen but what then what happened what happened one day there came something that could remit sin remit is mean to lay aside partly or wholly to be released from the guilt or the penalty of am so there came a blood that could release you from the guilt of your sin not guilty anymore it can lay aside the sin holy you said there may be some scientist sitting here I'm going to make a remark and just call it going to call it something doesn't mean that at all just going to say it but he said we'll get one little simple drop of ink God can hide himself in that if it's a a drop of ink it has to be something before it was a drop of ink see what it is the first it's a drop of it's a it's a drop of ink what is it it's chemicals and so forth and he says but but when it's you take that and you drop it into bleach into a bleach he said what happens to it every molecule of it changed until where it can't be found anymore amen it can't be found anymore this is what he did for us he said they manufactor this stuff they called bleach he said you women use it different with chloroxide what happens it makes it to where it turns it back to where it was its original and he said that's exactly what the blood of Jesus does to sin the blood of Jesus Christ confess your sin upon the blood it omits it it puts it in the sea of forgetfulness to re be remembered no more to be remembered no more Hallelujah amen this Omid means to leave out or exclude intentionally amen God is intentional with your sins he is intentional he said it leaves it out either intentionally or forgetfully Hallelujah so he intentionally takes your sins and puts them in the sea of his forgetfulness he's some kind of God because you know how we are as human we can keep a list a mile long but you asked for forgiveness and is struck off not just for the next five minutes or the next five years or the next 50 years it's struck off period it's over with it's done it's finished I hope that'll give somebody some victory tonight the devil's been trying to hold them sins of your past over your head but you've already asked for forgiveness of it it's omitted it's forgotten intentionally done away with why does he do that to give you the courage to stand as an adopted son of God and speak his [Music] word it's done we go back he said listen this is brother brother brother brandom's desire I'm trying to find where I is God hiding himself in Simplicity in 63 he said he said where is the church today if we're born to be sons of God Jesus himself said is it if your own law said you're Gods amateur Gods which control the Earth he said if they call those Gods whose the word of God came to the prophets the word of the Lord came to the prophets you call them Gods how do you condemn me when I say I am the Son of God he said of the blood of bulls and goats could give a power to Moses to go out there by the commission of God and stretch forth that rod and say Let There come flies he had the word and he spoke the word and when he did it became God's thought manifested expressed and so then when it was when it was God's thought put it in moses' mind and he spoke it it became a word and Moses turned and went back maybe not a fly in the country but within an hour from there maybe one old graen fly began to buzz around in a half an hour there was 10 lbs per square yard God God help me amen the creative word of God that was spoken by the lips of mortal man under the blood of bulls and goats that could not remit or omit sins he said God uses men God could use a son to preach the gospel God could use the wind to preach it but God chose men to preach the gospel what's the matter with the church today there's something wrong my opinion we're not coming with that sincerity to the right thing if God could do that by the blood of bulls and goats and Bulls that only covered sin made a pritu for The Sinner but the sin was still there only covered what can he do through the blood of his son that omits sin and God has not manufactured but he created a blood that takes away all sin and Mark 11:24 says whatever you say to this mountain move and don't doubt on your heart but believe what you said it will come to pass where is the Pentecostal church at today we don't realize that confess truly confess sins it has been omitted or done away with and it's built a bridge remember that Chasm this blood came and built a bridge across the chasm that brings you back into the presence of God hallelujah into the presence of the Creator and it makes you a Son of God and he said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do so Al that shall he do also amen there you are verily I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt on your heart but believe what you said it shall come to pass you can have what you said see my it's my God revealing himself in humility God taking a humble Sinner and cleansing him by his blood and dropping that confess sin and the Clorox bleach of the blood of the Son of God and putting his own life into that man by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then if we have the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost what's wrong with us when the type when Elijah dropped the robe for Elisha he got a double portion and Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also the greater than this shall you do for by going to my father what's wrong church question mark he said now you want to call us be above because of the visions and things like that get off my back amen hallelujah brother get off my back listen what he said brother get down to the Cross get the gospel we don't have to impersonate right come on now we don't have to impersonate why would we take an impersonation why would you take some false conception of it when the skies are full of the genuine Pentecostal power that makes a man or woman a son and daughter of God that takes him back in the presence of God they are God revealing himself in humility we're not impersonators we're back to the original amen but you got to get away from your own thoughts you got to let the mind of that was in Christ be in you you got to stay there till every sin of fear wow every sin of fear every sin of Doubt has gone from your heart what would they say he would tell them go and sin no more brother B would take you said what was he saying go and disbelieve no more people don't understand that disbelief is the very root of sin God help our unbelief he said I don't care how many degrees of doctors you have how many big churches you are what kind of big will you belong to how many organization whatever it is has nothing to do with it until your sins are confessed and in the blood of Jesus Christ you stand unadulterated born again son or daughter of God with the life of God in you to speak a word of creation hello somebody you stand unadulterated a born again son or daughter of God with the life of God in you to speak a word of creation let this mountain be moved and it will mind you it will mind you you know in speaking you know God Called Moses and he called him with a special calling and he said when God calls a man anoints him for a certain Duty he expects that man to carry it out to the letter God don't want to give a man a commission and him him hul around about it he wants him to go straight forward and do exactly what he commissioned him to do don't look right or left just move forward and I I want to put that in our boots amen he gave us commission Mark 16 he don't want you to him hul around he go lay hands on on the sick and let him worry about it let him fulfill it he will do what he said he would do that's his word he will not break his word amen he says see the children of Israel has been in bondage for some 400 years but God had made a promise he would set them free or visit them and God keeps every promise that he makes he will not lie he's God and the time has come for this and the time had come for this visitation now watch this he said I believe tonight paralleling that God made a promise he would return again and I believe we're near that time this morning I believe it I can almost feel the current as they say The Nearness of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah now Moses being called for this purpose he was a man God trained him 80 years 100 years before 80 years before he's able to use him 40 years in the palace 40 years in the wilderness God can train a man take him a 100 years for 30 minutes work but God knows how to train Hallelujah he been training a bride for 2,000 years Hallelujah he been training us but he knows how to train amen God trains his man then anoints him and gives them experiences to take them through the rigid training down through the Sands of burning punishment trying testing not only does that to His prophets he does does it to his children every son that cometh to God must be chastened and tried tested by his word and when the pinch come the strong time when it faces death you'll be able to stand on the word of God and said God said so it's settled God had called such a man and the man was Moses but Moses was a great deal like us every time he came to a place something had to be done Moses saidoh Lord what must I do to this in this place now isn't that just like we do God had blessed him he had anointed him above his Brethren given him a message and a Ministry that had not been on the earth since that day until that and he said yet every time something took place Moses ran off to God and said Lord what must I do what must I do God kind of got tired of that I believe he said why are you crying to me speak and go forward my if any time ever look like they ought to retreat but there is never any retreat in God hallelujah God's not going to get right up to the end and back up and say I'm sorry I I'm I'm going to back off and no sir it's always move forward it's always take another step there is no place to retreat in God go forward the doctor says it's cancer go forward if he says it's TB go forward if the devil says you can't give this up go forward if your home says you're going your home said you're going to be a fanatic go forward if the church turns you out go forward there's no retreating back go forward speak and go forward speak what his word not our own ideas not what we think about it speak his word thus sayeth the Lord and move on speak the word amen the people rebelled and said had it not been better we died in Egypt been better we had our Graves Mark and from the highs and the vs now to pick our bones in the wilderness why did you bring us out here they had seen that God had approved Moses to be a servant they had seen all the visitations they had seen the plagues they had seen all of this and Moses said what must we do and the answer was go forward that's right go forward he said Moses was called for the job and he would do it he promised that he would send such a thing in that day to deliver them and God did that part sent Moses and the children of Israel just because little stumbles and things come along to try them they failed to march on with Moses Now isn't that just like today we see the message come forth we see the church rise to a place on the wings of the Holy Spirit under the power of God Thrills every person in there the glory of God Falls around and signs and wonders are taking place less than a week Satan is permitted to come into that congregation what does he do God permits it and then the church begins to mmor and fall back maybe it wasn't so there there's where we fail that's the failing of the church regardless of what takes place it's God move forward well there's some brother so and so I shot the victory with him and he's back no matter what he done has nothing to do with you well so and so professor said said that wasn't right and this said this wasn't no matter what so and so said you are the guy that stood on those grounds amen you were there when the spirit came down it doesn't matter what anybody says he was there when he was pleased to dwell with us he was there when he spoke you were the guy at the burning bush what if the professors of Egypt what if Pharaoh would have said to Moses oh you just imagine you've seen a bush that was just roaring in your ears Moses knew where he stood Moses knew what talked to him and every man that's born of the spirit of God knows what talks to him when the Holy Ghost comes it speaks of peace that passes understanding Hallelujah think of it when God promises anything God will bring it to pass when God confirmed the word to you then believe it if it don't happen in the first five minutes believe it if it don't happen in the first day believe it if it don't happen in the first 20 years believe it anyhow amen if God spoke it it's going to come to pass he said in the last days he would pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh and your young men would see Visions old men would dream dreams upon my hands made and made service will I pour out my spirit and show signs in the heavens and the Earth great signs and wonders will take place in the last day and here we are in the last days and God is keeping his word the holy spirit is here and it vindicates that the coming of the Lord Jesus is near and people turn it down and murmur against it just like it was then but this is our deliverance God is with you speak and go forward God has anointed you move on don't him Hall around and say well should I believe God should I trust him for that trust him for every breath that you breathe trust his word he will fulfill what he said he would do he said he would be your provider he will be your provider he said he would be your healer he will be your healer he said he would be your deliverer he will be your deliverer what he said he will do said there was a great Stonewall Jackson he's been a one of my favorite generals since Joshua he says Stonewall Jackson was asked one time how can you stand with just a handful of men when the opposition is so great that's how he got his name of stone wall he would not budge he knew no retreat what could we credit a man like that to a man when those Yankees come down by the Thousand he was stand there in the minority and they never moved him he stood like a stone wall the rest of the Rebel Army had retreated back one of them screamed out what's the matter with Jackson why is he going he stands like a stone wall and that's where he got his title other generals asking Mr Jackson little bitty fell blackheaded blueeyed about 5' 2 Ines tall very modest mild speaking little fellow Mr Jackson how can you stand in such opposition bashful thing bashful like he kicked his boot on the ground he said I'd never take a drink unless a water unless I thank God for it first that's where it is there's no retreat in God speak and go forward that's God's commission to his church we have no time to be slack Hallelujah they say the Revival over it ain't over go forward it's time the Pentecost is played out it isn't it's time for p P cost to rise in the name of Jesus Christ and go forward there's no retreat there's no staying on the same ground let's move on with the spirit or the spirit will move somebody on somebody else and leave you standing follow him he won't leave you or forsake you Hallelujah the works that I do he that believeth on me shall do also am that's his words it ain't up to me to fulfill it the Bible says the Holy Ghost has come has to come in it'll give a witness you'll know yourself that Jesus is the Christ musicians can come because he lives in you then that same Holy Spirit introduces himself through the people and these signs shall follow them that believe the church will laugh at it and make fun of it we're just living living in that day we're just living in that day the atmosphere is getting charged up for an atomic bomb the Judgment the church is getting charged up ready for a Rapture hallelujah we're waiting anticipation waiting the church is waiting for the coming of the Lord the world is shaking wonder which one is going to get the bomb first or the other one we don't care which one gets there we're going here so it doesn't matter which one gets it there it doesn't have a thing to do with us we're just rejoicing happy believing that one day we'll hear a sound from heaven and our bodies will be changed and his church will be caught up in the air to meet him and to be with him in the air he that believeth on me the works said I do shall he do also what was the last thing he did he didn't want to just take one body up he wanted to take many I'm one of them I am one of them I don't care you can you can crucify me you can say whatever you want to say about me I know the spirit of God I've met the burning bush I ain't worried about your haha and you use and whatever name you want to call us I could care less I'm looking at one thing and what does he say about it that's all that matters I don't care what any other preacher says or any other man says I could care less I only care what the man upstairs says about My Worship about my praise about my life about my music unto him I could care less what the crowd says take this whole world Give Me Jesus you can get ready for a bomb if you want to I'm getting ready for the bomb in Gilead a bomb that's going to co come over this Mortal body and change it into immortality I'll be like Enoch took one step and he was not cuz God took him thus sayith the Lord speak don't cry speak and go forward God don't want a bunch of cry babies God wants men that's got backbone not wishbones wish I had this and wish I could do backbones that'll stand in the breach claim the victory claim the call they're called out in the midst of Darkness they'll say they're healed in the midst of sickness they'll say they're delivered and the change look like they're all around them that matters not what matters is what he said believe the message God is here he'll vindicate his message God is here he's the same God that was back there he's the same God in the days of Moses he's the same God of 2,000 years ago and he didn't fail then and he won't fail now the Holy Spirit has come and the signs of him being here is all around us yes hallu you so greater how can we do greater just give you his words if you take the original he doesn't say greater how could anything be greater than what he done he stopped nature he healed sick he raised the dead he cleansed the lepers he done everything but he said more of it you'll do for I'll not be only with you I'll be in you to the end of the world do you believe that he never left me Hallelujah he never left me aren't
