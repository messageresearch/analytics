their Church there who was there the weekend before ministering and had some wonderful meetings amen also glad to have brother AR and sister Lydia back as well from Cloverdale meetings there and understand it was a real blessing amen there as well so amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight and we're thankful to be at home and with our with the family of God that he's ordained for us to walk this journey with and amen may God bless you tonight Genesis 3 and verse one says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said un the woman yay ha God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for God had do know that the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil amen we'll let you be seated I'd like to speak to you this evening on faith over reasoning uh reasoning is the action or thinking about something in a logical or sensible way it's to reason is to think or to understand or to form judgments by the process of logic in other words just to think rationally or logically or to think straight to use one's mind to use common sense to use one's head or one's brain to think things through to intellectualize or to put a thinking cap on so to speak or to calculate or to come to a conclusion or to reckon or to consider you know there's nothing wrong with having intellectual abilities if we didn't have our mind or our brain our body would not function as we know it today you know and of course there's not nothing wrong anything wrong with having Common Sense we we know the world seems to be lacking in common sense today and you know brother Brandon would even speak a couple of times about putting on your thinking cap or your spiritual thinking cap you know mental capabilities are good unless they rise above the word of God uh and when you begin to reason the word of God and you exalt your thoughts above the word of God that's where you get in trouble amen there's not nothing wrong with thinking about something or or or reasoning it out or talking about it but when you got to make sure that the word of God is always above what you think feel taste smell hear whatever all these Earthly senses and so amen Paul would speak about it in 2 Corinthians he would say casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and so when we have thoughts and things in our mind amen it's very important that we bring it subject to what the word of God says because the word of God should be the most uh uh the highest uh form of judgment that there is in our lives amen Satan but Satan's reasoning in his way of reasoning he wants us to put our thoughts above what the word says he wants us to put our feelings or our emotions above what the word says amen he he God but God also calls us to reason he would say in Isaiah 18 and verse 20 come now and let us reason together sayeth the Lord amen but he calls us to put the word above our thoughts Amen to put what God has said above what we think or what we see or what's going on in our life and this is what he says come now and let us reason together sayeth the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow and though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool if you be willing and obedient you shall eat of the good of the lamb but if you refuse and rebel you shall be devoured with a sword for the mouth of the Lord has spoken and notice where he brings these thoughts back to to the word of God what I have spoke it shall come to pass amen so he's saying let us reason let us judge this but let us judge it by what the word says not by what our feelings or what our situation speaks about us but by what the word says about us amen amen in other words you can read the scripture and this is very beautiful I was just reading in the back very quickly as I before I come out and and and we find that Judah had sinned and they' went away from God and he speaks about their sin and their wrong and he says but I have a blood you sinned you've done wrong but I have a blood that's going to make your sins white as snow amen you've Fallen but I will restore amen you've done wrong but I'm going to make your wrongs right again amen and after I'm done you shall be called the city of righteousness the faithful City amen that's a wonderful thing that God even though we've done wrong even though we' Fallen amen God says don't look at that don't look at the feelings that it's caused but look what what my word has declared about you that I'm going to raise you up out of your sin and I'm going to make you white as snow amen but the serpent was there reasoning with Eve and you know you know saying you know God's too good God God's a merciful god he he loves you too much you you know you he won't he won't let you die see he said that's the same old devil today God's too good to do this God won't do that God won't punish this God will do exactly what his word said he will do God will do exactly what his word said he would do now I don't know about you but I'm thankful to serve a god like that I I've said it before I couldn't imagine servant of God who had one thought today and another thought tomorrow or or said one word today and as men do or politicians do have you know make promises but they never come to pass amen but I'm thankful I'm not serving a god like that that if he spoke it he's going to do what he said he's going to do if he promised it he's going to bring his promises to pass every devil in hell may try to stop it every devil in hell may try to hinder it it may try to amen try to slow it down but that word will come to pass it will be fulfilled amen you know people are all excited about Trump you know he he's fulfilling campaign promises you know one of the first one of the first presidents we've ever had is doing what he said he's going to do amen and they're getting all upset about it but he told him what he's going to do I thought about that you know that's amazing that we have a God that's made promises and they've laid there for thousands of years and men's pondered about him they reasoned about him they looked at him they wondered but God said it he's going to bring it to pass and it ain't a president making campaign promises it's a god whose word will never fail it'll never return into void but it will accomplish what he said it would do amen so if he said it it's going to happen amen you shall he said then but the serpent said You shall not surely die see he added one word to the that phrase amen you shall surely die you shall not surely die that's what he tries to do just get you to add one little word to the word of God Amen cuz he knows if you had to or take away amen amen it strips the power of the word that's been given amen so what's he trying to do he's get trying to get her to reason with him and the minute that you reason with God's word you lose Faith the minute you put your thought above what the word of God says you lose Faith amen you don't you don't have no yes NOS maybe St but you have to stay right with what the word said but the serpent said to the woman ye shall not surely die for God knoweth the days you eat thereof and then your eyes are going to be open and you'll be as Gods knowing good and evil see he was giv her a reason wouldn't it be nice to be equal with God wouldn't it be amazing to be able to know what God knows wouldn't it be be amazing to have his abilities and to be able to do this is what he was offering her this reasoning Amen to take what he said when you hear that when you hear Satan coming to you like that he says get away from it that is the HS of the serpent it might sound reasonable but don't reason with it just believe what God Said Hallelujah when the woman saw that the tree was good for food see what it was his reasoning brought her to know that it was that it was right that was there that was pleasant to the eye and a tree to be desired to make one what Have Faith No to have one more knowledge no to make one wise see what it was Satan presenting knowledge knowing that it was contrary to the word there's nothing wrong with knowledge as long as it lines up with the word amen this is where where they get they get people in the in in these institutions of of learning amen because they put things above what the word said amen and they get people all tore up and when they put things above what the word says see their eyes were open and they knew they were naked amen with reasoning Faith though has no reason you don't reason at all you just believe when you prayed for you accept God's word for healing and you don't reason it with your feelings or do I feel better do I not feel better it has nothing to do with that I believe what his word said he said they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover it doesn't matter if I feel it today or I feel it next week or I feel it in a month it matters not I believe what God's word said amen so we see here amen he's always trying to get you to doubt what God Said God said you're a child of his God called you a son God called you amen a child of God but Satan is always there to try to put reasonings there well if I was his son I wouldn't have faults I wouldn't have failures I wouldn't make mistakes I wouldn't f all that does not have nothing to do with being a son or not amen you know when I yeah I kind of got in the fields a little bit today if that's the way you can say it I seen a picture of me and my two little boys they're not two little boys no more they're they're they're grown men but at one Andrew was giving me a hug and a kiss and Luke's standing there next to me but you know as a father I tried to keep them from harm and and dangers but they were walk many times they were walking beside me and and they might fall but it wasn't my fault they fell right come on it wasn't what I done cause them to fall but as a child learning they fail they they made mistakes they they did things wrong amen many times people look at God and say why would God allow the things to happen the way they've happened amen and and God's right here beside us why would he allow amen for things to happen why because he wants to show amen those times that you fall those times that you have troubles and those times you have sicknesses that he's there to heal you he's there to lift you up he's there to comfort you just as a Earthly father when a little child would fall down his skin his knees every father in here would go to him and say okay son it's going to be all right let me Pat you up a little bit let me take that old dirt off of there that's what the father does though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow amen amen but Satan wants to come and say well God doesn't care about you God doesn't care about the things you're going through there he is standing right next to you and you're having troubles and you're having calamities and you're having sicknesses amen but that does not change who God is God's word will come to pass he will fulfill his word but it's Satan trying to get you to doubt amen what God is doing even now in your heart Amen brother brandom had this he had mind battles aren't you thankful amen the prophet of God had mind battles uh Elijah had mind battle every man every human Jesus himself had mind battles amen so he talks about the vision that was given of the grizzly bear and the caribou and and he said you know he G Lord gives a vision something's going to happen he says you know he said I don't matter what happens contrary it doesn't matter but Satan will always try to present something he'll try to reason and say Well it can't happen and said when we got there the God said well I never seen a silver tip in this area besides we're going up to where the Sheep country is on horses there's there's no Cil ta you ain't going to get it there see trying to move us away from a vision reason trying to move us away Satan said to me he said well see you must just have misunderstood the vision you must have just misunderstood the vision that this is going to take place he said but I didn't it's going to be thus sayith the Lord and when the caribo come up and we got that which was in the vision as you know and he God said to me very fine brother amen he said brother Brandon my brother had epilepsy rode up on a horse that day and told me how to do a certain thing my brother epilepsia would cease and when I did exactly what the Holy Spirit told me to do he's never had a spell from that he said but now we're at the top of this mountain and three miles down there's not even Bush a bush 4 Ines High nothing but Caribou Moss a few blueberries they only get 2 or three inches high hey there's no room for a Grizzly to be anywhere where and you're going to shoot and kill a 9 foot Silver Tip grizzly bear I said that's thus sayith the Lord but what was it Satan was trying to get me to disbelieve it he was trying to make even the conversation come around the brother just as innocent maybe as he could be he was just pointing out what's true I mean it's facts there ain't no Bush High Enough there ain't no blue the blueberries the Caribou Mo Moss it can't hide No 9 foot care uh grizzly bear amen but it didn't matter amen what we're talking about amen the God who creates squirrels The God Who could create something out of nothing amen this whole world we walk around on every day was created out of nothing amen so Satan will always try to bring a conversation around to get you to doubt what God's doing in your life amen that's why we got to be careful of what we're talking about and how we're talking about things amen what is it Satan trying to get you to reason that's what he does around conversations and uh and things around in just living rooms around families or friends you know we get to talk about this and that pretty soon we're bringing up this trouble over here that trouble over there what's he trying to do he's trying to get you to bring doubt and reasonings amen well there you know well I mean there there's got to be better better churches than what we got and all these kind of things what was he trying to do bring doubts and reasonings just by conversation he said are you doubting Bud well we're only a mile from where we got to be are you doubting not at all well there ain't no moss and there ain't no ain't nothing tall enough to are you dialing bud not at all I mean he just told the testimony of how his brother had epilepsy you know the story and he and brother Bram told him said when he goes into that fit take his shirt off throw it in the fire and he'll not have it again and it happened exactly as a prophet said it would so he had this testimony he knew this wasn't just somebody some fly my night preacher that came but it was a man who had told him the truth and it had come to pass and yet in still in his mind he's trying to think about how in the world will this happen see amen Satan is always trying to get your thoughts to be higher than what God's thoughts are are but the vision is higher than the thought it's going to come to pass amen see we got well we got a half a mile now we only half that's right just think in a half a mile look we can see right before there's nothing out there I said but the lord gave me the word he can create one where he wants one see you don't reason just believe it don't pay any attention to reason there's nothing to it at all just believe what God said that's all and I'm standing there looking at up on the Hills everywhere yellow Caribou Moss sun going down Hills are beautiful you could see any little spot anywhere for three miles up the mountain above me and around me when I looked about two miles ahead of me a mile and a half two miles stood a 9- foot Silver Tip Grizzly how he got there I don't know but he was there see that's exactly how the promises of God will come to pass in your life how it comes to pass I don't know but if you'll keep believing it'll be there it'll come out of nothing when it seems impossible and it seems like there ain't no hope whatsoever but the God who can create squirrels and flies and gats and frogs and create this whole universe out of nothing it's a god who's in control of every situation you go through he's in control of your children he's in control of your family he's in control of it all I don't know how he's going to do it I just know he said he would he said it I believe it see no matter what the circumstances are don't pay attention to circumstances God said the day you eat thereof that day you die Satan said well let me tell you something God's we say God's true sure that's right we believe the word okay I believe that real sure but listen let me tell you he didn't exactly mean that he didn't exactly mean that he did mean that he meant exactly what he said see over there look I tell you why he did it see you're not really wise yet you got you ain't got any wisdom you just like a sheep to be led to the slaughter you're not your own you know that's the way God wants you you ain't got no PhD yet you ain't got noed enough education yet but I've got wisdom and I'll prove it to you now look you don't know what's right and wrong you don't know there's such a thing but you do know what it is see let me show you how it's done that's all he wanted to tell that woman that's all he wanted to do let me show you how it's done she said but we'll die but surely God wouldn't do that he knows that you'll be wise too see he was putting his wisdom above or against the word of God that's the wisdom that we're talking about amen it's the wisdom that tries to come against your faith amen it's not it's not even you know even your own thoughts it's Satan coming in placeing those thoughts inside of you and your mind and it's constantly battling why cuz he's trying to battle against the faith amen amen the first battle amen was right there God but God's word was true no matter what reasoning says and when they partook they the what was forbidden they died so we're not to reason knowledge and knowledge has reason and faith has no no reason Faith holds on to it you know we we we talk about the five senses and and we talk about the six sense but he brother Bram brings it down he says there's five senses that that that communicate with this Earthly body he said but there's two that comes to the soul he talks about faith faith and doubt and Satan tries to get in these mental faculties Amen to either to try to get into that realm of doubt in your in your soul because he knows and I'll get to it he knows eventually your your your ability to reason is going to be done come on you're going to lose this one day and he knows he's going to you're going to die and that mind's going to Decay but that soul is eternal and so he's trying to get down into that Soul amen what what if Abraham would have reasoned out all the things that went around him he had many reasons to reason first he was way old his wife was way past menop paa and and it seemed impossible for this to even come to pass totally impossible that's right but reason should have showed that that it can't happen but Faith showed that it could Hallelujah see Faith don't take reasonings Faith holds on to the word the word said I'm going to give you a seed amen somebody you know would say well I I believe well brother Rand I believe that's the truth you're saying he said but if I did that you know if I I if I believe really took what you teach I'd be begging I they'd kick me out of my church they he said they just had to kick me out nobody else would have me he he'll have you Hallelujah you can't live here forever you got to go there see Faith knows no reason it just Bel separates you from every tie you stay right with faith and reasoning to drop off now man can have intellectual Faith now we're going to go into this a little deeper man can have intellectual Faith that's where most Christians get today calling themselves Christian the reason you see such carrying on as you do under the name of Christianity because it's only intellectual Faith what do you mean intellectual Faith man believeth unto salvation faith by here and hearing the word he said now I could preach the word and you accept it and say that's all right I believe it well that that's no F if it no goes no further than that you'll never get very far with God that's intellectual Faith that's the reason why people doesn't get healed because of intellectual Faith their mind conceives it but then their mind will reason it away this is exactly what intellectual Faith amen toward salvation is they receive it in their mind but then alone comes Satan and he talks them out of it but if they can ever get it down on the depths of their soul they ain't no more talking out of it amen they ain't no more changing the heart they ain't no more changing what's on the inside it's done it's sealed until the day of their Redemption but as long as it stays as an intellectual conception and I believe it I believe it's the truth I believe it's right I believe this I believe what brother Timothy saying brother Jo brother Aon brother Tim I believe all of that but we want to go more than just this mental conception of the message or a mental conception of what a Christian is I come I come to the house of God because I'm a Christian I worship because I'm a Christian I do this because I'm a Christian and it just becomes nothing but a a intellectual conception of what God has required but God requires more than that come on amen amen Cain had an intellectual conception God had cursed the ground notice what Cain bring I was going to bring this down maybe we'll get into it again but I I'll just touch it for a moment Cain Cain God had cursed the ground but Cain had learned and Seasons Came Upon the Earth there used to be no Seasons right it was all green and beautiful but the fall came and Seasons happen and nature dies away then spring comes summer winter for all that and he learned by his natural abilities how to plant he learned how to grow he learned how to deal with adversities and weeds and all this stuff and this is what he brings to the altar was what he had learned amen what he had learned by intellectual abilities and be how to grow the best fruits and how to grow the best plants and the most beautiful thing and he's so proud of what he done and he brought what he had learned amen but Abel realized it wasn't on what he had learned what they had learned had got them out of the garden come on he saw what it took it took not what they had learned but what God had done for them and he saw that it wasn't his intellectual abilities that was needed it was the blood of the lamb and this is where people get in trouble they go as far as the intellectual conception and 20 years down the road they fall off somewhere why because they never came to the blood the reason people don't get healed because they have an intellectual view of what their mind conceives but then they'll leave the service and their mind will talk them right out of it their senses will cannot be I'm no better my senses of sight says I'm no arms no straighter my my feeling says I don't feel any better reasoning mental reasoning now wait a minute you say I believe that's foolishness see you're reasoning that's in what intellectual faith will do when once that faith comes down into this compartment the soul it'll never question again it's absolute fact it'll agree with every Divine word of God there's a reason people don't get to where they should be it because because it's a mental conception of God and when that but we believe we we believe in by intellectual Faith but that won't do it it's got to be a born again experience amen where your faith is brought down into the soul and no matter what it may look like out there faith says it's Soul anyhow he said there was going to be a 9- foot grizzly bear amen it isn't up to me to produce it it isn't up to me to bring it to pass he said so and if he said it I believe it but Satan's always there to bring all these thoughts and conversations to try to get you to doubt what God has done if you got good reason you'll sit down and try to reason out the Bible men have done it went insane how could this happen how could that happen how could this be over here people will get get all kind of thoughts tore up about a a fish swalling Jonah how could that be that you know anybody's just seen the news or whale swallowed that kayaker swallowed him and took him down next thing you know he pops up and his kayak pops up they said well see that I just showed you somebody had to comment you know everybody's got a comment nowadays and well I just shows you that Jonah couldn't have been swallowed by a whale really my Bible didn't say it was a whale say it was a fish so if you ask me it was a special kind of fish apparently it was very special for man man to live three days under there God can do whatever he wants to do whether you want to let him or not whether you want to believe him or not God's God you're not we're not amen so he creates somebody made this statement that me and brother Aaron laugh about it quite a bit said the B he said I believe the Bible said the Bible said Jonah got swallowed by a bluegill he said I'd say one big bluegill right that's where you got to be with God if God said it I don't care how ridiculous it is to this mental conception that I have or how I think or how I can draw it up amen people want to people want to put God in a box of a thousand years ago or 2,000 years ago or 60 years ago in their mental conception and draw him up a certain way and you know how they draw how they always brother BR talks about how they draw Samson and they make him this big muscular guy and and the prophet of God comes along and said he wasn't no big muscular guy he was a little old bitty shrimp well that goes against human reason cuz somehow this little shrimp got the gates of Gaza and carried it up to the hill what was it showing it wasn't by man's ability or man's strength it was by the spirit of God and this is where we got to come amen when it's not by might not by power but by the spirit of God it isn't by my intellectual abilities it it isn't about my human abilities it's about the ability of almighty God to bring his word to pass and if he said it I believe it sir you'll never know him by reasoning God is not known by reasoning he's known by faith you accept it you believe it you can't do it until something happens in you and that Holy Spirit comes in and then you have the mind of Christ Jesus was said no man cannot even understand the kingdom of God except that man be born again see that's the problem people don't come to that Born Again experience therefore they try to add two plus two and it don't always come up to four as we heard brother brother Joe preached on it for a long time God does impossible math 5 plus two does not feed 5,000 not with intellectual ability ities or thinking it ain't possible that as far as intellectual ability to believe or to think put it that way to think that five fishes and two loaves of bread is going to feed 5,000 is it come on Amen brother Derek and then probably worry about running out of food and their own little shop here in menant right they they try to plan they try to to do amen but this one had nothing to do with planning the discip disciples hadn't done no planning and Jesus said you got any food they said well no we ain't got nothing got any money no we ain't got nothing what he got I got a couple I found a little lab with five fishes and two loaves of bread bring it to me and he begins to bless it and it begins to break it off and break it off until they fed 5,000 then they had 12 baskets left over now that doesn't compute with a human bra you can't believe it with this human abilities you got to believe it by faith and the same God that provided for 5,000 is the same God that can provide for you tonight amen if he would break off Fish and Loaves amen for 5,000 people that he was ministering to don't you know that he knows your need tonight he knows your struggle he knows what you're going through he knows your financial situation and he still Jehovah Gyra he still can provide when there's nothing in the bank account and there's nothing around to go he can still come on the S and put something there when there's nothing there he's that kind of God but except a man be born again he cannot understand the kingdom of God there's no way of understanding it until you are born again then God reveals himself to you then you know that you pass from death and life because no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Spirit the only way you'll ever know that Jesus is the Christ is when the Holy Spirit personally witness to you that he is the resurrected Lord Jesus no matter what he would do what kind of signs what kind of Miracles you'll never know it until your personal experience with God you say well I I believe it's because the Bible said so that's good the Bible's true I know it is well the preacher said so perhaps he knows it mother said so she knows it maybe but what about you do you know it do you know it you'll never know it until it's revealed to you individually by the Holy Spirit then by acception you become new creatures in Christ Jesus born the second time you can't live twice you have to die once in order to be born again and when you die to yourself you're born again of the Holy Spirit there's no reasoning of the word of God you take it for what it says it settle God said so it's finished but it's our little weakness in our own human intellect what we call human what we call intellectual Faith so we read a little something and say well yeah that's right I I believe that's right you're you're you're preaching that's right that's intellectual but brother something's got to happen down in the depths to make you really believe it cuz intellectual faith will reason I mean Eve believed God was real she believed that he said what he said was going to come to pass but it had to go beyond intellectual Faith well you say well my my case is so hard there's no need of even if even trying my case is too hard that's your reasoning is there anything too hard for the Lord what's too hard for God he said one time ago I got saved about 23 years ago I made up my mind right like this I wasn't going to worry about anything God said because God is able to keep his own word any job that's too big for God to do what's the use of me worrying about it amen if he's almighty God he does all things if he can't do all things he's not almighty God therefore I believe in to be almighty God so I commit myself to him my soul my body my living my breathing my D my resurrection and some glorious day he will come back for me but while he's coming his church is in the make it I want to stand in the breach with my arms out and claim his resurrection power that he's the same yesterday today and forever and his powers never ceased and never will fail he's the same all the way around I love him and I want you to love him I want you to believe him perfect love cast out all fear if you love him with the right kind of heart you you won't have one Speck of fear whether he'll keep his word or not that's night after night standing on the platform before gross thousands of people around the world critics is this that or the other which doctors this that and the other challenge you never one time I say by the grace of God has one Speck of fear ever hit my heart not one time he said he would come he would take care of me and I believe what he said any more Believers in the building tonight but I tell you when the Lord Jesus anoints you you're not made out of running material not the rock of they said this ain't the rock of jabal broter I'm talking about it's the Rock of Ages you can climb up on that God's word and take your position there and stand there while the gates of hell are battling against you with this perfect assurance that he who promised it will not fail and cannot fail that's Faith that's when you're not scared the devil you know he's nothing but a bluff snorting and blowing Thunder and carrying on but I tell you the lightning power of the resurrected Jesus Christ puts a reality there that'll shock the soul from the dead Slumber of these Earthly bound things into the immortal Realms to believe God and take him at his word and call those things which are not as though they are oh God I pray let the lightning power the resurrection to Jesus Christ strike this building tonight not just this building but strike these temples sitting here Amen to believe for the impossible to believe for healings to believe for deliverances Amen to believe for our loved ones to come home it doesn't matter how bad it looks it matters what his word said and I he said it I believe it he said the reason we have such times as we have listen to this this is powerful the reason we have such hard times or such times as we are have is because there's too much halfway conversions intellectual conversions there's two different elements in the human body that has a has a mind one of them is reason is of the mind which is intellectual the other one is the soul which does not reason but believes the word of God you know sometime they said the science laughed at the Bible and said the Bible says a man think it's in heart so is he the Bible's all mixed up because the man has no mental faculties in the heart but last year they proved that God was right they found right down the heart of a man not in an animal a man a little compartment there where even a blood cell doesn't exist they say it's the occupant of the Soul amen while where the Man soul lives each one of you has had an experience to think you know to to think like that that he said when somebody says it can't happen it won't be but something down on your soul is telling you it's going to be it's going to be the world is saying the devil's saying there's not going to be a Rapture but there's somebody here on the face of the Earth saying it's going to be it's going to be it's going to happen it don't make no difference what anybody else says how unreasonable it seems you seem to know it's going to be that way is because your soul has testified and reason is have been cast out is the bble said they should he said I want each Christian here tonight no matter what church you belong to that doesn't matter has nothing to do with it this time amen for the Bible plainly says by one Spirit we're baptized into the body it's whether you're right with God or not is the main principle and the mind will reason things it'll look here and say well this is unreasonable it'll sit here and look at this woman in the wheelchair and say well she's paralyzed she can't walk and she'll sit there it'll look over here at this one has got bone problems and maybe a spine broke and say well there ain't no way there's no help for that one all kinds of reasons that come back but as long as you dwell in mental reasonings you will never see no difference but the Bible says we got to cast them down it doesn't matter what it looks like it matters what his word says by his stripes it's time we really got to believe in that come on somebody to believe it with our whole heart it doesn't matter what it looks like doesn't matter how bad it looks doesn't matter what the signs say as so far as physically amen the body may say one thing it only matters what his word says by his stripes I'm Healed it's finished it's done it's over with he's already paid the price come let us reason together by his stri I am healed what the devil has stole from some of you he stole some of your health and he's come and stole things in your body and and moved in ways and deformities and caused issues and he cause all kind of infirmities amen but let us reason together let us bring some true reasoning what's true reasoning let's bring the word of God into this the word of God says the Lord God is the Healer of all our diseases and the word of God Says by his stripes I am healed so we cast down every reasoning he talks about a woman as we bring this down how she was reasoning with the word she's reasoning with things and she kept bringing up excuses why she wouldn't surrender to God tells about this woman woman her soul would tell her that's wrong but she'd push that aside and she'd lift up her reasons well I ain't going to go to church because I got this problem or you know the biggest reason the devil keeps some people out of the church is because he said well you can't go until you get right what kind of reason is that you go so you can get right well you go then people going to look at you funny so what does it matter it only matters what how he looks at me but he brings all kind of reasonings up well if you go they're going to say this they're going to do that they're going to make fun of they going they're going to sneer and snot they're going to and you get there many times and they they're the first ones that throw their arms around you and welcome you back but the devil had kept you out for months and months and months he why because of reasonings trying to bring this up and this up over here and cause this doubt over here and then she said he said she kept pushing that down her soul would want to get right and she'd push it down her soul would want to get right and would try to come and speak the word of God he should push it down and he talks about it she kept grieving that soul and finally it begin to separate from her and go away and after a while she got to a place that a young fellow moved in the neighborhood married man and she began to have a lot of Friendship with this nice slick fell he picked her up talking to her PE taking her places and finally end up kissing her good night and not the back of fence and after a while she left her husband he left his wife and they married which is contrary to the word of God see that Soul disbelieving it finally moved away from God and got away from God she was going by reasoning now listen to this she was still playing the piano in church I'm not talking about somebody you'd think is a r cner playing the pen on Church a good member just as good as anybody she moved into another neighborhood with this man and continued on into church brought her letter to another church first thing you know the woman finally well that man woman going if he said he took us she he took up with another woman and she takes off again runs around finally wound up with a common law husband it finally caught up with her and she began to get some an and aches and pains in her lower regions she went to the doctor and had a malignancy there and the doctor said prepare for death it's coming and a certain Minister which was a friend of mine went to her to talk about her soul to her why she'd give him to understand smoking one cigarette after another I never sent for you and I'm just as good as you are so reasoning had talked her into this I'm just as good as you are he said that's the very attitude proen what she was she said I belong to church I was raised in church he said listen I belong to the same church I know that our church doesn't teach that you got to be born again she said you get to the door if IID wanted you I'd have sent for you all right I've done what I can and he leaves and talking the minister come talk to brother Brandon he said well watch her when she goes to die at the end of the road because she just committed that sin and went to reasonings instead of listening to her soul but that soul will catch up with her someday when she come time to die Pastor was with her people in the room just as normal thought she was all right believing she was all right when she come to die when those mental faculties that operated by Blood and nerves which was in the brain that will perish at your death hello that will perish at your death your mental faculties your reasoning will pass away because reasonings cannot come in the presence of God it reason with God it's but it's the soul that lives and the blood cease to go through her brain cells and the nerve seases cease and her memories are her reason begin to Cast Away then what happened the soul that she had grieved had been dead to her all those years begin to come to her and she be to scream my God I'm lost the Pastor said oh come on here dear here I'm lost the doctor ran says she's getting hisory cicle give her a shot I'm lost I'm lost it sealed her lips to their other Mortal ills that shot to put her out but the soul that realized and had been grieved away it'll haunt her as long as is there's an eternity so remember don't go by reasonings go by faith that's the way you do it that's accepting the Lord Jesus Christ amen and being born again of the spirit of God when your entire soul testifies the word of God is right and you stay with it and you believe every word because their spirit bear record with his spirit is it what he said in Proverbs 3 and vers vers five trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding see we cannot lean to what we understand or what we can see with these natural eyes because God sees things a whole lot different in what we see listen it's amazing I've watched Christians face death even death you can't even give an good excuse for and just wonder why how why why why why would this happen but because they're not listening to reasonings they're not leaning on their own understanding but they're trusting God in all their ways they can continue to take another step it ain't easy they take another step they get up and go another day they move another mile why because it ain't on their reasoning it ain't on how they can figure it out because see God sees things a whole lot different than what we see God allows things to happen in our lives because he sees way ahead down our roads we may not can see amen just even the next mile marker but God can see all the way down to our Eternal he said I know the thoughts that I think about you they are of good and not of evil cuz I want to bring you to an expected end he already has seen the end he already has seen the journey he already has seen every part of it so God can see things when we don't so how can we reason God and reason against his will and say how could this happen how could this be no we have to say God I trust you I don't know why I don't know how I don't know where how this is going to turn out but I trust God and God's brought me this far and the one who brought me here who started the work he's not going to drop me off and forsake me but he's going to finish what he started oh bride of Jesus Christ we ought to take great confidence in our God he didn't come down to the seventh Church age to give up and to lay it aside and throw down his throw down his tools as it were as a man that was chiseling out a piece of stone and gives up on it no this God ain't going to give up but he's going to keep hammering at it and hammering at it and hammering at it amen why cuz he is had in his mind a masterpiece of Christ and it will come to pass as in his mind I don't know how I don't know how it's G to be people ask me all the time now how how you think this is going to work out Trump's in here and this I said don't matter it's just going to work how God's planted there ain't nobody that's come up into power and kingdoms arose that God didn't have it in his orchestration God's been in control moving ponds and pieces to bring us to an exp expected end what is our expected end a body change a meeting in the air in the Sweet By and By we cannot lean to our own understandings we cannot allow our thoughts to come higher than his word but tonight let's exalt the word of God higher than I God your thoughts are higher than my thoughts your ways are higher than my ways your ways are past finding out man has draw made himself go crazy trying to figure out God you'll never figure out God but God wants to come and move in our hearts and lives and lead us as Lambs that are just willing to walk along with him knowing he's got it oh yeah he's got it he's in control let's bow our hearts reasonings how's this going to work out he said he's going to do this how's it going to be I don't know I just know he said it and if he said it that's good enough for me is it good enough for you tonight if God has spoke it will he bring it to pass in your life I mean I wonder how many just say Lord I I want more than a mental conception or intellectual faith Lord I want it to fall down so deep into my soul All Hell Comes against me I'll stand on the Rock of Ages yes Lord oh Father hands lifted up all over this building Satan loves to use our intellect make us doubt and reason and come up with thoughts and ways and think this that and the other think tanks of how this is going to be or how that's going to be mean while interjecting his reason his thoughts what he thinks into our lives sometimes Lord we'll take his thoughts and we'll exalt them above your word God forgive us we pray forgive us Lord you saw the hands would say Lord I want more than just an intellectual conception or intellectual Faith Lord I want that deep down into my heart that no matter what comes what goes I still believe I still believe oh Jesus we love you father We Praise You Lord we lift your name up tonight we thank you Lord that we have such a word today Lord that'll bring us back to the center line in our lives Lord and allow us to stand

heart here tonight every situation father and you're working it all out for our good Jesus we love you Lord with all of our hearts forgive us of our unbelief Lord forgive us of our doubts father the
