[16:27] few days to virginia and as well as the
[16:29] meetings here this weekend brother
[16:31] jackson
[16:34] we also have a just a testimony we um we
[16:38] closed on our house today so we
[16:40] just you know we made the first thought
[16:42] to move here uh if you've done that or
[16:45] you know somebody's done it you just see
[16:46] that he's so mindful every step of the
[16:48] way the minute we started putting things
[16:50] into action he came behind just the
[16:53] ceiling of our home the moving over here
[16:55] the transition the outpouring of love
[16:57] everybody supported us and then we just
[16:59] kind of capped it off today with the
[17:01] closing of our home so that's something
[17:02] special to us

[17:11] heavenly father lord we
[17:13] invite you into the service tonight lord

[17:19] other's neck and we could have words of
[17:21] encouragement lord but if you were to
[17:23] come into this service father it would
[17:25] make the difference
[17:26] lord and i was pondering and thinking

[17:30] you don't put more into a sunday morning
[17:32] service or wednesday night lord to you
[17:35] they're both equal but when the people

[17:42] it up lord and i just pray that you
[17:44] would just come and be dynamic tonight
[17:47] lord many times we've seen you move in
[17:48] services lord and
[17:50] and you didn't look at a time and you

[18:30] that there's testimonies behind every
[18:33] behind every person that raised their
[18:34] hand lord behind every knee that was
[18:36] submitted lord and i ask that you would

[34:01] verse 14 and unto the church or to the
[34:03] angel of the church of the laodiceans
[34:05] write these things saith the amen the
[34:08] faithful and the true witness the
[34:09] beginning of the creation of god i know
[34:11] thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[34:14] hot i would that thou are cold or hot so
[34:16] then because they are lukewarm and
[34:18] neither cold nor hot i will spew thee
[34:20] out of my mouth
[34:21] because thou saith i am rich i'm
[34:23] increased with goods and have need of
[34:25] nothing and know us not that thou art
[34:27] wretched miserable poor blind and naked
[34:29] notice
[34:31] the laodicean attitude toward the word
[34:33] of god
[34:35] and then it says now i counsel thee to
[34:36] buy me gold tried in the fire that thou
[34:38] mayest be rich and white raiment and
[34:41] that thou mayest be clothed and that the
[34:43] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[34:45] anoint thou eyes with i said that thou
[34:47] mayest see as many as i love i rebuke

[35:02] that overcometh will i grant to sit with
[35:03] me in my throne even as i also overcame
[35:07] and i am set down with my father and his
[35:09] throne
[35:10] verse 22 he that hath an ear
[35:12] let them hear what the spirit saith unto
[35:15] the churches god bless you you can have
[35:17] your seats tonight
[35:19] we're not going to try to hold you too
[35:20] very long tonight but
[35:22] just to kind of give you an update we
[35:23] were in arizona this past weekend at the
[35:25] tucson tabernacle had two services there
[35:27] we had a just a tremendous time with the
[35:30] believers there and they really uh just
[35:32] enjoyed the word and we had a little
[35:34] prayer line sunday evening after service
[35:36] and i got a text a little earlier today
[35:38] from brother aaron guerra he said my
[35:39] daughter wanted to let you know that
[35:41] that spirit of oppression that you
[35:42] prayed for left her and she's delivered
[35:44] and they're just rejoicing there with
[35:46] that so we thank you for that because we
[35:48] can't go on our own with your prayers
[35:50] it's uh we as a family a church family
[35:53] when i go i represent each and every one
[35:55] of you here and so we're just honored
[35:57] that god would so see fit to use us in
[35:59] that capacity so we had a great time but
[36:02] it follows our lot tonight to speak to
[36:04] you and we're just looking forward to
[36:05] what the lord has in store for us and
[36:07] let me get my timer started here but i
[36:08] want to speak to you tonight on listen
[36:10] to the voice notice i didn't say listen
[36:13] to a voice but listen to d voice so we
[36:16] know that there's many voices in the
[36:18] land today but we want to make sure that
[36:20] we're listening to
[36:21] the voice
[36:23] the bible will tell us here in john
[36:25] 10 and verse 27 my sheep hear my voice
[36:30] okay
[36:33] come on sheep
[36:34] this is going to be class participation
[36:36] tonight
[36:38] my sheep hear my voice
[36:41] and i know them and they follow me now
[36:42] this word here means the same word that
[36:45] you find here in john and here in
[36:47] revelations 3 22 it means to attend to
[36:51] to consider what is or has been said to
[36:54] perceive the sense of what is being said
[36:57] or to understand
[36:59] so it's one thing to hear the audible
[37:01] voice but it's another thing to
[37:03] understand to consider to attend to and
[37:06] we understand that sheep may hear a lot
[37:08] of voices you ever been around sheep all
[37:11] they do is sheep music
[37:15] have a sheep act i don't know i've not
[37:16] been around them but but they hear all
[37:18] these voices but they only hear the
[37:21] voice of the shepherd
[37:23] see they only attend to the voice of
[37:25] their shepherd they only perceive what
[37:28] is being said when the shepherd speaks
[37:30] to them see the sheep they may hear a
[37:32] lot of voices but that's the only voice
[37:35] that really matters to them see their
[37:37] safety does not rely in knowing all the
[37:40] other voices their safety lies and
[37:42] knowing that all the other voices is not
[37:45] the voice of the shepherd
[37:47] come on sheep i'm talking to you tonight
[37:49] i'm preaching to you tonight and you're
[37:51] sheep tonight and there's all kind of
[37:53] voices in the land and your safety does
[37:55] not depend on all these other voices
[37:57] your safety tonight depends on that you
[38:00] know that all these other voices is not
[38:02] the voice of the shepherd because the
[38:04] shepherd is here to guide you the
[38:06] shepherd is the voice of truth the
[38:08] shepherd is the voice of protection the
[38:10] shepherd is the voice of safety the
[38:12] shepherd is the voice of life and my
[38:14] sheep hear my voice
[38:17] they attend to they understand they
[38:20] perceive what the spirit what the voice
[38:24] is relating to
[38:27] notice now
[38:28] john 10 27 my sheep
[38:31] hear
[38:32] my voice
[38:34] and i love this next part put this up
[38:36] there if you don't mind and i know them
[38:40] come on sheep
[38:42] you know it's one thing for you to claim
[38:44] i know god i hear his voice but it's
[38:47] another thing when that god the great
[38:49] almighty the creator heavens earth when
[38:51] he knows you tonight
[38:53] oh you can hear his voice but it's one
[38:55] thing for you to hear his voice it's
[38:57] another thing for him to know you in
[38:59] that word no there means to have
[39:01] knowledge of he has knowledge of you
[39:04] he's acquainted with you i sell glory to
[39:06] god tonight what a people we are to be
[39:09] known by the shepherd to know them no
[39:11] matter where we are whatever we're in
[39:13] the struggles of life he gave a word to
[39:16] us i'll not lose one of mine i'll leave
[39:18] the 99 and i'll guard for that one long
[39:21] sheep because that sheep i'm acquainted
[39:23] with that sheep i know that sheep
[39:27] and though that sheep may be lost
[39:30] though that sheep may not find its way
[39:32] back for a long time
[39:34] he said i'll not lose one
[39:37] i'll not lose one because my sheep will
[39:40] hear my voice oh don't you worry about
[39:43] your loved one tonight if they're sheep
[39:45] tonight you got a promise
[39:47] i'll lay the promise before almighty god
[39:49] say god i claim it tonight i'm your
[39:51] sheep i'm the sheep of the pastor you're
[39:54] the sheep gay lord i'm trusting that you
[39:56] to keep your word tonight
[39:59] now notice we find in matthew 7 and 22
[40:02] many will say to me in that day lord
[40:04] lord
[40:05] have we not prophesied in thy name
[40:08] watch all these goats start jumping up
[40:11] have we not prophesied in thy name have
[40:12] we not cast out devils and in thy name
[40:15] done many wonderful works
[40:19] and then will i profess unto them i
[40:22] never knew you
[40:24] i never had knowledge brother aaron of
[40:27] you i never was acquainted with you
[40:32] because they were never sheep
[40:35] because my sheep hear my voice and i
[40:38] know them
[40:40] i'm not speaking to the matthew matthew
[40:43] 7 22 23 group tonight i'm speaking to
[40:46] true sheep
[40:47] i'm speaking to those who have ears to
[40:49] hear what their spirit is saying to the
[40:52] church
[40:53] now we find here in the message
[40:55] the ephesian church age brother branham
[40:56] would say that he said it may be that
[40:59] millions will hear these words
[41:01] let me back up he that hath an ear let
[41:04] them hear what the spirit saith unto the
[41:06] churches it may be that millions will
[41:08] hear these words or read them but how
[41:11] many will pay heed to them
[41:14] that we do not know but we but listen
[41:17] what he says now but he who will lend
[41:19] his ear
[41:20] and want to know the words of truth will
[41:23] find the spirit of god enlightening him
[41:27] oh my why are you here tonight because
[41:30] there's a deep calling because there's
[41:32] something inside of you wanting to know
[41:34] the truth there's something pulsating
[41:36] within you didn't put it there man
[41:38] didn't put it there your favorite
[41:39] preacher didn't put it there the prophet
[41:41] that god didn't put it there but god
[41:43] almighty put it there before the
[41:44] foundation of the world and when you
[41:46] hear the word come forth what is it it
[41:48] begins to draw on that seed on the
[41:50] inside of you and it draws you to god
[41:52] and the spirit of god begins to
[41:54] enlighten you it begins to revelate you
[41:56] and you become stimulated by revelation
[41:59] i believe the word today can still
[42:00] stimulate people it can stimulate the
[42:03] young it can stimulate the old he can
[42:04] stimulate the middle age i believe the
[42:06] word of god is still in effect today
[42:09] i believe we got life-changing power in
[42:11] this message if we'll just recognize it
[42:13] didn't come from a seventh grade
[42:15] kentucky it came from almighty god god
[42:17] almighty dropped down in this hour in
[42:19] this age and this dispensation and he
[42:21] broke the seals off the book and he
[42:23] revealed it to a special class of people
[42:27] but if you can listen to the voice
[42:30] you will hear not joe adams tonight
[42:33] you're going to hear the voice of god
[42:34] speaking to you
[42:37] notice what he says now if your ear is
[42:39] open to the word the spirit of god will
[42:41] make the word real to you
[42:44] if your is open not shut off
[42:47] not close to it but if your ear is open
[42:50] to the word the spirit of god will make
[42:52] the word real to you now that is the
[42:54] work of the spirit he goes i can teach
[42:56] you the truth but if you don't open your
[42:59] ear to it
[43:00] and your heart to receive it you won't
[43:02] get the revelation
[43:04] so some of us sometimes we walk into
[43:06] church and we shut down on the minister
[43:07] because we got a bad day right
[43:09] like brother branham talked about sarah
[43:11] she wasn't in any form to receive the
[43:12] visitation
[43:14] that happens that's just humanity but
[43:16] don't let that be every service
[43:19] i mean come on let's come with an
[43:20] appetite to receive let's come on ears
[43:23] that can hear what the spirit is saying
[43:25] to the church now the prophet of god
[43:27] will tell us how tragic it is this is
[43:29] the ephesian church age how tragic it is
[43:32] that the first age did not listen to the
[43:34] spirit
[43:36] instead it listened to man but thank god
[43:39] in the last stage there will be a group
[43:41] rise up the true bride of the last day
[43:44] she will listen to the spirit in that
[43:46] day of gross darkness the light will
[43:48] return by their pure word and will
[43:50] return to the power of pentecost to
[43:53] welcome back the lord jesus now here
[43:56] we're talking about the ephesian age the
[43:58] first message of being paul paul being
[44:00] the one who founded the church who
[44:02] established the church in just a few
[44:04] short years 30 years at the
[44:06] establishment of the church the people
[44:08] begin to get away from that voice that
[44:11] anointed voice that anointed messenger
[44:13] that anointed servant of god and they
[44:15] begin to listen to the voice of man
[44:18] and the prophet of god will say how
[44:20] tragic it is that that church age
[44:23] refused to hear the voice of god and
[44:25] they went off with the voice of man let
[44:27] me tell you laodicea let me tell you a
[44:29] church of the living gods like don't you
[44:31] be heed to all these other voices but
[44:33] give credence to one voice and that's
[44:35] the voice of our beloved
[44:39] notice what he says now
[44:41] the ephesian age means aimed at but
[44:43] relax
[44:45] the high aspirations of this age that
[44:47] had begun with the fullness of the
[44:49] spirit the depth of god whereby they
[44:52] were aiming at the high calling of god
[44:54] and began to give way to less watchful
[44:57] attitude
[45:00] let's just be an opener to us like don't
[45:01] you get lacks
[45:04] stay home on wednesday night just
[45:05] because you don't this doesn't work out
[45:06] you don't forgot your peanut butter at
[45:08] home or walmart or wherever it is any
[45:10] kind of excuse you can put there i've
[45:12] seen a man stand behind the pulpit
[45:13] service after service after service for
[45:16] two solid years with stage four lymphoma
[45:18] cancer and i'm telling you we're without
[45:20] excuse tonight
[45:22] oh you play games tonight you can play
[45:24] games but one day there's going to be a
[45:26] calling and those are going to stand
[45:28] before the judgment seat of god and you
[45:30] either make your calling sure now or
[45:32] you'll be refused on that day
[45:37] so we find here notice they begin to
[45:39] have a less ardent following of jesus
[45:41] christ began to manifest itself as an
[45:44] omen that in the future ages the
[45:46] physical vehicle called the church would
[45:48] sink to the awfulness of the death of
[45:51] satan it had become relaxed and was
[45:53] drifting already the age was backsliding
[45:56] it left its first love a mere 30 years
[46:01] we're 59 years since 65.
[46:07] and if this church age
[46:09] had already drifted away from its voice
[46:12] what about this age that's why it's so
[46:14] imperative and so paramount that we hear
[46:17] the voice of god
[46:19] and not just hear it to say well i
[46:21] listen to a tape today but i mean hear
[46:23] it i mean pour yourself into it i mean
[46:25] become the word the prophet of god said
[46:28] you become the word as you receive the
[46:30] word and how do you receive the word by
[46:32] hearing the word by attending to the
[46:34] word by allowing that word to bring
[46:37] correction to bring encouragement to
[46:39] straighten your life bout it's no longer
[46:41] a man's idea or the denominational idea
[46:44] or the traditional idea passed down from
[46:46] generation to generation but you buck
[46:49] all that and you hear the voice of the
[46:52] lord
[46:55] notice now but he said in the last days
[46:57] in the in the age of gross darkness god
[46:59] has already decreed that there will be a
[47:01] true bride rise up
[47:04] oh that's when you can shout tonight
[47:06] there's gonna be a true bride rise up
[47:08] she ain't gonna fall like that first
[47:10] bride fell but she's gonna stay true to
[47:12] the word
[47:14] cause why cause she will hear only what
[47:17] the spirit is saying she will hear the
[47:20] voice
[47:21] of god in this age
[47:23] i say what a prize
[47:26] what a prize
[47:28] i'm talking about you tonight
[47:30] what a bride
[47:32] i no longer call you church but i call
[47:34] your bride tonight let me tell you that
[47:36] wasn't william branham that was almighty
[47:38] god showing a separation why because you
[47:41] didn't give over to the voice of the
[47:43] nomination you refused that voice and
[47:45] you believe you went with the voice of
[47:47] god and he separated you and he gave you
[47:49] a new distinction tonight and he calls
[47:51] you the bride of jesus christ i said oh
[47:53] what a bride tonight what are people
[47:55] tonight you've been called by almighty
[47:58] god
[48:01] this bride she's not following the
[48:02] voices of man
[48:03] she's not looking after the voices of
[48:05] psychology and ideologies and dogmas and
[48:08] traditions that's been passed down from
[48:10] one generation to the next generation
[48:13] she's following the voice
[48:15] of her beloved
[48:18] john 5 and verse 19.
[48:23] and then answered jesus and he said unto
[48:25] them verily verily i say unto you
[48:27] the son can do nothing of himself
[48:31] but what he seeth the father do
[48:33] for what things so ever he doeth
[48:36] these also do with the son likewise
[48:41] the son didn't do anything separate from
[48:43] the father
[48:44] and brother brother man will tell us in
[48:45] an exposition of the seven church ages
[48:47] he says now notice the harmony of the
[48:50] father and the son
[48:52] the harmony
[48:53] they were in mutual agreement
[48:55] jesus never did anything until it was
[48:57] first showed him by the father and he
[49:00] says now this harmony is now to exist
[49:03] between the groom and his bride
[49:08] he shows her his word of life
[49:11] she receives it
[49:13] all right she never doubts it
[49:16] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[49:19] death the word is in the bride as it was
[49:22] in mary the bride has the mind of christ
[49:25] for she knows what he wants done with
[49:27] the word she performs the command of the
[49:29] word in his name for she has thus saith
[49:33] the lord notice where the word is the
[49:36] word is in the brine what is the word
[49:37] the word is christ christ is the
[49:39] anointing that means that the authority
[49:41] is in the bride tonight the power to
[49:44] manifest the word is in the bride
[49:45] tonight the miraculous is in the bride
[49:47] tonight the supernatural is in the bride
[49:50] tonight healing is in the bride tonight
[49:52] deliverance is in the bride tonight
[49:54] whatever you have need of it lays in the
[49:56] bride tonight if you'll just recognize
[49:58] who you are and i'm here to tell you
[50:00] there's a voice speaking to you tonight
[50:04] he said those in the bride do only his
[50:06] will no one can make them do otherwise
[50:10] not even their favorite preacher
[50:14] they have thus saith the lord or they
[50:16] keep still
[50:18] notice now revelations 2 and verse 11
[50:22] he that hath an ear let them hear what
[50:24] the spirit saith unto the churches every
[50:27] single age
[50:30] has the same admonition
[50:32] to the people of every age
[50:34] you go through revelations 2 and you go
[50:37] all the way through revelations 3 and
[50:39] you find at the end of every age to he
[50:41] that hath an ear
[50:44] because there's going to be a people out
[50:45] of every age that hears what the
[50:47] spirit's saying
[50:49] there's going to be somebody who's going
[50:51] to hear the voice of god
[50:53] and not just hear it but line up to it
[50:56] he says but it's absolutely impossible
[50:59] for all men to hear what the spirit says
[51:02] to the other to to the different ages
[51:04] let's go to first corinthians 2 and
[51:05] verse 6. now this is in the mess of the
[51:07] ephesian churches or the smyrna in
[51:09] church age he says now howbeit we speak
[51:11] wisdom among them that are perfect yet
[51:14] not the wisdom of this world nor the
[51:16] princes of this world that came to not
[51:18] but we speak the wisdom of god in a
[51:21] mystery
[51:22] even the hidden wisdom which god
[51:24] ordained before the world unto our glory
[51:27] which none of the princes of this world
[51:29] knew
[51:31] not those great men they didn't know
[51:32] these things
[51:33] for had they known them they would not
[51:36] have crucified the lord of glory but as
[51:38] it is written eye has not seen nor ear
[51:41] her neither have and enter into the
[51:43] hearts of man the things which god hath
[51:46] prepared for them that love him
[51:49] come on bry you that love him tonight
[51:52] but god hath revealed them unto us by
[51:55] his spirit for the spirit searches all
[51:58] things yea the deep things of god for
[52:00] what man knoweth the things of man save
[52:02] the spirit of man which is in him even
[52:05] so the things of god knoweth no man but
[52:07] the spirit of god the only way that we
[52:09] can know the spiritual things is because
[52:11] the spirit of god is in us
[52:14] and now verse 12 now we have received
[52:16] not the spirit of the world but the
[52:18] spirit which is of god that we might
[52:20] know the things that are freely given to
[52:23] us of god which things also we speak not
[52:26] in the words which man's wisdom teaches
[52:28] but which the holy ghost teaches
[52:30] comparing spiritual things with
[52:32] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[52:34] not the things of the spirit of god for
[52:36] they are foolishness unto him neither
[52:39] can he know them because they are
[52:41] spiritually discerned
[52:44] but he that is spiritual judges all
[52:46] things yet himself is just of no man for
[52:49] who has known the mind of the lord that
[52:51] he may instruct him but we have the mind
[52:54] of christ now let's look over here in
[52:56] matthew 13 and verse 13. i'm building my
[52:59] foundation if that's all right this
[53:00] evening
[53:02] i got a little bit more time we're good
[53:04] therefore speak out unto them in
[53:05] parables
[53:06] because they seeing see not and hearing
[53:09] they hear not
[53:11] so it's more than just having eyes to
[53:13] see and ears to hear because hearing
[53:15] they hear not neither neither do they
[53:17] understand and in them is filled the
[53:19] prophecy of isaias which saith by
[53:22] hearing you shall hear and you shall not
[53:24] understand and see you shall see and
[53:26] shall not perceive for this people's
[53:28] heart is wax gross their ears are dull
[53:30] of hearing their eyes they have clothes
[53:33] lest at any time they should see what
[53:34] their ear or their eyes and hear with
[53:36] their ears and should understand what
[53:38] the heart or with their heart and should
[53:40] be converted and i should heal them but
[53:42] blessed are your ears and your eyes for
[53:45] they see in your ears for they hear see
[53:48] not everybody can receive this
[53:50] revelation tonight but he says blessed
[53:52] are your eyes
[53:53] because your eyes can see see beyond the
[53:56] veil you're looking beyond the man and
[53:58] you're looking at the spirit which is
[53:59] anointing that man to preach the word
[54:01] and he says blessed are your ears to
[54:03] hear because you're not hearing the
[54:04] audible voice of joe adams tonight or
[54:07] tim pruitt or aaron oaks me or your
[54:09] favorite preacher you are hearing the
[54:11] voice of god and i say blessed be you
[54:13] tonight brother jesus christ you have
[54:15] been anointed for this hour you are
[54:17] being predestinated for this moment
[54:20] that should make you rejoice tonight
[54:24] he said it is most evident from these
[54:25] scriptures that no man of himself can
[54:28] hear god
[54:30] that ability has to be given him to god
[54:34] or of god excuse me that ability has to
[54:36] be given him of god that's why we would
[54:38] find in matthew 16
[54:40] jesus speaking to simon he says simon
[54:42] barjona for flesh and blood and not
[54:44] reveal these things to you
[54:46] these things are not revealed just by
[54:48] doing a casual study just because you
[54:50] got the table on your computer or on
[54:52] your phone or on your tablet or wherever
[54:53] it is yeah it's revealed by god
[54:57] because there's somebody's going to hear
[54:58] the voice in this hour
[55:00] now listen what he says here in the
[55:02] summer in church he's look i may get a
[55:03] little bit pentecostal here in a minute
[55:06] so y'all can get with me you can like
[55:08] brother i ain't going to say it i'm just
[55:09] going to keep on preaching this ain't my
[55:10] church but it says putting these verses
[55:13] together we can see that there is only
[55:15] one group of people
[55:18] come on get with me tonight one group of
[55:20] people and that a very special group of
[55:24] people who are able to hear what the
[55:26] spirit is saying in each age it is one
[55:29] special group that receives a revelation
[55:31] of that age i say oh blessed be the name
[55:34] of the lord tonight you're not in the
[55:35] denomination you're not doing the
[55:37] badness you're no longer in the catholic
[55:39] system you're not there in the met in
[55:41] the methodist or whatever maybe no
[55:43] you're a special group of people who
[55:45] have been anointed in this hour to hear
[55:47] what the fear the spirit is saying to
[55:49] this age
[55:51] he said that group is of god because the
[55:54] the other group cannot hear
[55:57] see
[55:58] he said that group is of god because the
[56:00] group that cannot hear is not of god
[56:02] they are the ones who have the spirit of
[56:05] god they are the ones who are born of
[56:07] god they are baptized into the body of
[56:09] the lord jesus christ by his spirit they
[56:11] are baptized with the holy ghost
[56:16] so when you get up in the morning
[56:18] and you don't feel like you're a
[56:19] believer you don't feel like you're a
[56:21] christian you don't feel like you got
[56:22] the holy ghost just come back to what
[56:24] the word just said about you you're a
[56:26] special group of people
[56:28] because why because your ears have been
[56:31] anointed to hear this word
[56:34] listen what he says in the exposition of
[56:36] the church age the church is made up
[56:38] good and bad
[56:40] the church is made up of good and bad
[56:42] two vines make up the church
[56:44] they are like the weed and the tares
[56:46] growing side by side but one is true the
[56:49] other is false
[56:51] now god will speak to each one and he
[56:53] will talk about each one
[56:56] he will call them church
[56:58] but only the elect will really know
[57:00] which is a true spirit
[57:04] that's why some people can sit here and
[57:06] you talk about cain and abel and they
[57:08] always identify with
[57:10] cain but the true spirit's gonna
[57:12] identify with abel
[57:14] judas and jesus
[57:16] that false spirits are always gonna
[57:17] identify with the judas
[57:21] but that true spirit's gonna identify
[57:23] with this word with christ with jesus
[57:25] and we look here in revelation of jesus
[57:27] christ paragraph 96 the book of
[57:29] revelation brother tim brought this out
[57:30] the other day and yeah i took it and
[57:31] i'll put it right here
[57:33] because it's just pertinent he says now
[57:34] the book of revelation has more symbols
[57:36] in it than all the rest of the books in
[57:38] the bible it has more symbols because it
[57:40] is the book of prophecy and if i recall
[57:42] correctly your pastor said that is your
[57:45] book
[57:46] come on church
[57:48] don't make me do all the preaching
[57:49] tonight that is your book it's a book of
[57:51] prophecy it's revealing to an endtime
[57:53] people exactly what's going to come on
[57:56] this earth and what's going to
[57:57] foreshadow you as a body you're not
[57:59] being left here but god's already
[58:01] predestinated your body changed he's
[58:03] already predestinated that moment well
[58:05] you'll be changed in a moment in the
[58:07] twinkling of an eye get your eyes off
[58:09] the chaos around you and look what the
[58:11] word said you're a special group of
[58:13] people
[58:15] notice now the book of revelation has
[58:16] more symbols in it than all the rest of
[58:18] the books in the bible it has more
[58:20] symbols because of the book of prophecy
[58:22] it's a prophetic book therefore it has
[58:25] to be understood by a prophetic class
[58:30] this book is not meant for everybody
[58:34] see there's nobody can understand it
[58:36] harley this book is made for a certain
[58:39] class of people
[58:43] oh my my my my you are that special
[58:48] class
[58:50] all the devils told you they ain't gonna
[58:51] mount too much the devil told you you're
[58:53] never gonna get it you never had it to
[58:55] begin with you're some low down scandal
[58:57] but the word here we find is to a
[58:59] special class of people a special group
[59:02] of believers oh church let me just take
[59:04] that shouting grounds tonight
[59:06] to recognize who you are you're not just
[59:08] some castaway you're not here by
[59:10] accident tonight but god called you as a
[59:13] special group not everybody can be a
[59:15] part of that special group not everybody
[59:17] is a part of that prophetic class
[59:20] but you are
[59:23] you are that bride that's been ordained
[59:24] not to fall like the first teeth you are
[59:26] that group that's been predestinated by
[59:29] almighty god to rise above it all you
[59:32] are that elect true church that can and
[59:34] does hear what the spirit of god is
[59:36] saying you are that prophetic class
[59:39] oh
[59:40] hallelujah you are the one that spoke
[59:42] about in the end time there's going to
[59:44] be an overcomer and without grant to sit
[59:46] with me in my throne as i have overcame
[59:48] and sat down with my father in his own
[59:51] i'm talking to an overcoming group
[59:52] tonight a special group tonight hell
[59:55] don't have enough to stop this
[59:56] overcoming group tonight because you're
[59:58] a very prophetic class
[1:00:01] if satan could stop that he would have
[1:00:03] already stopped you but he can't stop
[1:00:05] what god's promised
[1:00:08] oh you're going to overcome this age of
[1:00:10] complete darkness you're going to
[1:00:11] overcome an age of complete apostasy
[1:00:13] you're going to overcome when sin has
[1:00:15] reached this zenith you're going to
[1:00:16] overcome in satan's eating because you
[1:00:19] have been anointed
[1:00:20] to listen to the voice
[1:00:25] christ the mystery of god revealed he
[1:00:28] told eve don't do this
[1:00:30] and don't do that and you can do this
[1:00:32] and you can do that
[1:00:34] and you young people like yeah sounds

[1:00:43] can't do that
[1:00:44] but satan says oh
[1:00:47] but you know
[1:00:50] you know you got some friends like that
[1:00:51] don't you
[1:00:53] they make real friends
[1:00:56] and brother brown said she turned around
[1:00:58] and she listened
[1:00:59] to him
[1:01:01] now she knew what to do because she
[1:01:02] heard the voice
[1:01:03] because adam was lip to ear with
[1:01:06] almighty god
[1:01:08] but even the last day now this is your
[1:01:11] prophet
[1:01:12] talking about you
[1:01:13] special group prophetic class
[1:01:15] but the even the last day is not going

[1:03:38] he chose you to be able to rece not just
[1:03:41] hear it but to hear it to receive it to
[1:03:44] attend to it to understand what is being
[1:03:47] said to this generation

[1:04:56] man but we are feeding on the unfailing
[1:04:58] word of the body word of the son of man
[1:05:00] tonight the word is being revealed to an
[1:05:03] endtime people
[1:05:08] the word is being revealed
[1:05:11] not just to let me put it like this the
[1:05:12] word is
[1:05:13] being revealed in
[1:05:15] an endtime people
[1:05:19] why do you believe the things you
[1:05:20] believe
[1:05:21] because the word is being revealed
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:32] the spirit-filled man
[1:05:34] can hear that revelation
[1:05:37] you know when i first came to this
[1:05:39] church
[1:05:40] man i didn't understand nothing
[1:05:43] all this brother branham this and
[1:05:45] brother branham that and i didn't have a
[1:05:46] clue brother aaron
[1:05:48] but i knew something was calling me here
[1:05:51] i've been in baptist i've been in the
[1:05:53] pentecostal i've been in the methods
[1:05:54] i've been in the presbyterian but there
[1:05:56] was something different
[1:05:58] i didn't understand all the stuff i was
[1:06:01] hearing
[1:06:01] i was like man what is all this but i
[1:06:04] sat there long enough
[1:06:07] i gave my ear to it
[1:06:09] i had my share of some shakes and some
[1:06:11] valleys and some battles i had to work
[1:06:13] through some doubts and some this and
[1:06:15] some that to make sure that i believe
[1:06:16] that the message were true but you know
[1:06:18] what i didn't have to make myself
[1:06:20] believe god began to reveal those things
[1:06:22] and when that word becomes a revelation
[1:06:24] to you nothing can shake you off that
[1:06:26] foundation and that's what i'm telling
[1:06:28] tell you tonight when i heard the voice
[1:06:31] of the lord uh he wasn't the voice of
[1:06:33] tim pruitt though he's got a great
[1:06:35] ministry it wasn't that voice or wayne
[1:06:37] lawson or ron spencer or whoever you
[1:06:39] want to put there it wasn't their voice
[1:06:41] there was the voice of the lord that
[1:06:43] spoke to my heart i didn't know what i
[1:06:45] was looking at but i knew it was the
[1:06:47] voice i knew that god came down and he
[1:06:49] changed my life around and i'm here to
[1:06:51] tell you like that same god that worked
[1:06:53] out in me is the same god that planted
[1:06:55] you here tonight that's why you're here
[1:06:57] it's no longer mama's religion or
[1:06:59] daddy's religion or granddaddy's
[1:07:01] religion and mamaw's religion it's
[1:07:03] become your god because you have heard
[1:07:06] his voice
[1:07:08] there's a young people in this hour who
[1:07:10] is hearing the voice of the lord and
[1:07:12] their lives have been changed and
[1:07:14] they're manifesting the revealed word
[1:07:16] for this hour

[1:07:46] into his nature he said god above us god
[1:07:48] with us god in us
[1:07:52] god in his creation are above his
[1:07:54] creation and his creation and then god

[1:08:07] baptist so me and brother brandon on the
[1:08:09] same wavelength we're real baptists
[1:08:11] he says now while i was looking at that
[1:08:13] i got so full of the holy ghost until i
[1:08:15] set my gun against a tree and i run
[1:08:18] around a tree just as hard as i could
[1:08:20] kicking one foot up in the air whoa whoa
[1:08:25] well joe you need to calm down that's
[1:08:27] out of church order well you need to get
[1:08:29] into the word
[1:08:32] he said i was kicking one foot up in the
[1:08:33] air screaming to the top of my voice
[1:08:36] hollering hallelujah hallelujah
[1:08:37] hallelujah halloween just around and
[1:08:40] around and around until i almost fell
[1:08:42] down you know what he wasn't caught up
[1:08:44] in the spirit there was a little bit of
[1:08:45] humanity in that
[1:08:48] he almost fell down but he says i did i
[1:08:50] just threw my hands straight up and down
[1:08:52] and i began to holler glory glory glory
[1:08:54] glory hallelujah hallelujah just as hard
[1:08:56] as i could run i couldn't think of
[1:08:58] nothing else to say my heart was
[1:09:00] bubbling over
[1:09:03] the deep call until the deep i heard god
[1:09:05] out younger in the way that maybe that
[1:09:07] you you wouldn't hear him but to me he
[1:09:09] was in his universe calling back i'm the
[1:09:11] god of creation i made all things by my
[1:09:13] hand yes it's somebody would have come
[1:09:15] in those who they thought there was a
[1:09:17] maniac in the woods
[1:09:19] and you probably think there's one on
[1:09:20] this pulpit tonight
[1:09:21] around and around and around that tree i
[1:09:24] went just having a glorious time
[1:09:27] oh some of you critics need to just
[1:09:29] shake yourself a little bit and try to
[1:09:30] get into the spirit
[1:09:32] well i just don't want to have to work
[1:09:34] myself up
[1:09:35] well maybe you need to try for a minute
[1:09:40] you don't step behind this pulpit all
[1:09:41] alone in the first 15 minutes
[1:09:43] you work at it it's the same way in
[1:09:46] worship service
[1:09:47] that song leader don't come out here
[1:09:48] just all jacked up
[1:09:50] and he works at it he's giving it it's a
[1:09:52] it's a sacrifice
[1:09:55] a sacrifice of praise of sacrifice of
[1:09:58] worship oh but you get there and you get
[1:10:01] in there and you begin to worship and
[1:10:02] you've been to call on god and you can
[1:10:04] be put yeah you got to put a little
[1:10:06] humanity into it but all let me tell you
[1:10:08] that the spirit of god begins to fall
[1:10:10] then all of a sudden it takes that
[1:10:11] humanity apart it takes that that
[1:10:14] emotion apart and you begin to be caught
[1:10:16] up in the spirit and then you begin to
[1:10:17] preach things that you didn't know was
[1:10:19] there you god begins to pull you to
[1:10:21] somebody's knee what isn't i'm talking
[1:10:23] to you about i'm talking about allowing
[1:10:24] the spirit of god to move through you
[1:10:26] and to work through you and to create an
[1:10:28] atmosphere to where the almighty god can
[1:10:30] come down and speak to a people and the
[1:10:33] people can hear the voice of a living
[1:10:35] god not a voice of yesterday but a day
[1:10:38] god a now god a living voice a living
[1:10:41] god with living signs and living
[1:10:43] miracles
[1:10:45] the same god that met that young lady
[1:10:47] last weekend in arizona who had a spirit
[1:10:50] of oppression and now she's delivered
[1:10:52] because there was a voice came down
[1:10:56] notice because what i was in god's
[1:10:58] cathedral
[1:11:00] i could see him everywhere the sun the
[1:11:02] streaks coming through the woods the
[1:11:04] rainbow yarner the wolf hollering the
[1:11:06] elk hollering i could hear him in the
[1:11:08] winds oh my everywhere
[1:11:12] if a prophet of god
[1:11:15] could act that way
[1:11:18] in the woods
[1:11:19] because he could see god
[1:11:21] in his creation
[1:11:24] what about us who's been anointed
[1:11:27] elected to seek god in his word
[1:11:34] see
[1:11:35] clouds can overshadow the bright sun
[1:11:38] and you may miss god there
[1:11:40] but you won't miss him in his word
[1:11:43] oh if he can act like that there what
[1:11:46] about us here tonight
[1:11:48] to recognize you have been called to
[1:11:51] receive this word
[1:11:54] oh my
[1:11:55] it does something for me
[1:11:57] it does something for me listen let me
[1:11:58] get to this
[1:11:59] my mama i need a i need a two hour
[1:12:01] service now y'all good for that
[1:12:03] just kidding
[1:12:06] listen what he says here this is in
[1:12:07] smyrna church age
[1:12:09] i'm going to slow this down for a minute
[1:12:10] and teach us if i can go there
[1:12:13] he there
[1:12:16] let's look at this he that half an ear
[1:12:18] now how many you got ears
[1:12:21] not these two
[1:12:23] what you got here you're hearing what
[1:12:25] the spirit
[1:12:26] you know so slang saying you're picking
[1:12:28] up what i'm putting down
[1:12:30] that's what i'm talking about tonight
[1:12:32] he that happened here let him
[1:12:35] singular
[1:12:37] all right let him singular hear what the
[1:12:40] spirit saith
[1:12:41] to the churches
[1:12:43] notice here that jesus by the spirit in
[1:12:45] every age
[1:12:47] addresses himself
[1:12:49] to only one person
[1:12:52] one person relative to the word for that
[1:12:54] age only one messenger for each age
[1:12:57] receives what the spirit has to say to
[1:12:59] that age and that one messenger is the
[1:13:02] messenger to the church
[1:13:06] not people not the eighth messenger we
[1:13:08] don't need that one
[1:13:10] we don't need people picking up and
[1:13:11] finishing where the prophet got stopped
[1:13:13] we don't need that one
[1:13:15] one messenger to one church to one age
[1:13:19] all right he speaks for god by
[1:13:22] revelation to the churches both true and
[1:13:24] false
[1:13:27] the message is then broadcast to all but
[1:13:29] though it is broadcast for all who
[1:13:32] coming within range of the message that
[1:13:34] message is received i want you to clue
[1:13:36] in right here everybody clued in
[1:13:39] everybody clued in i need everybody
[1:13:41] right here
[1:13:42] all right listen that message is
[1:13:44] received individually by only a certain
[1:13:48] qualified group in a certain way
[1:13:54] i'm trying to show you who you are
[1:13:57] that message is received individually
[1:14:01] only or only to a certain qualified
[1:14:04] group in a certain way each individual
[1:14:06] of that group is one who has the ability
[1:14:10] to hear what the spirit is saying by the
[1:14:13] way of the messenger those who hear are
[1:14:16] not getting their own private revelation
[1:14:18] nor is the group getting their
[1:14:20] collective revelation but each person is
[1:14:23] hearing and receiving what the messenger
[1:14:26] has already received from god
[1:14:30] so can i break that down for you just a
[1:14:32] few minutes
[1:14:33] because i told you i was going to teach
[1:14:34] this i want to just
[1:14:36] work on this principle here now notice
[1:14:38] those who here are not getting their own
[1:14:40] private revelation brother ben hears
[1:14:42] brother joseph hears and they get your
[1:14:44] own private little revelation
[1:14:49] or brother jackson brother aaron brother
[1:14:51] joe different ones we get a collective
[1:14:53] revelation and we put it together and
[1:14:55] see what it all says
[1:14:57] no he says that's not what's happening
[1:14:59] you're not getting your own private
[1:15:00] revelation you're not getting a
[1:15:02] collective revelation but each person is
[1:15:05] hearing and receiving what the messenger
[1:15:09] has already received from god
[1:15:13] so now if that's the case it begs to
[1:15:16] question why are there so many groups
[1:15:19] around or associated with this message
[1:15:22] why is there a thunders group why is
[1:15:24] there a perugia group why is there a two
[1:15:27] souls group and a return group and all
[1:15:29] these different groups and all these
[1:15:30] different revelations
[1:15:35] so did they hear the voice the same
[1:15:38] voice and they come away all these
[1:15:40] figureheads of these these groups did
[1:15:42] they hear the same voice and all of them
[1:15:45] come away with their own idea
[1:15:50] i'm going to say it like this if that is
[1:15:52] the case and we got one message to each
[1:15:54] age then if those groups and and and
[1:15:57] their ideas were so paramount why didn't
[1:16:00] the prophet of god found the thunder
[1:16:01] group why didn't he establish the
[1:16:03] perugia group why didn't he establish a
[1:16:05] two soul group in the return group why
[1:16:07] didn't he establish all that if we're
[1:16:09] receiving the same voice that
[1:16:12] the messenger received
[1:16:17] one message
[1:16:19] one messenger
[1:16:21] from almighty god
[1:16:22] dispersed out to a special group of
[1:16:24] people
[1:16:25] galatians 1 9 the prophet of god or the
[1:16:28] bible will tell us if any man preach any
[1:16:30] other gospel unto you wish that whatever
[1:16:31] have received let him be a curse this is
[1:16:34] paul paul is your first church haste
[1:16:36] messenger we're preaching the same thing
[1:16:38] paul preached we don't have a different
[1:16:39] idea we don't have a different doctrine
[1:16:41] we don't have a different dogma we're
[1:16:42] going to have a different creed we have
[1:16:43] nothing different than what paul
[1:16:45] preached and paul said if any man
[1:16:46] preached any other gospel
[1:16:48] unto you than what i've already preached
[1:16:50] let him be a curse and that word of
[1:16:51] curse there means without hope of being
[1:16:54] redeemed
[1:16:57] my mama that's a strong
[1:17:00] strong indictment
[1:17:04] but he said if you're a christian you
[1:17:06] will get back to what the spirit is
[1:17:08] teaching that is the word of this age
[1:17:11] every messenger to every age will preach
[1:17:14] that word every fresh and true revival
[1:17:17] will be because men have gotten back to
[1:17:20] the word for their age
[1:17:22] why is their revival even like
[1:17:23] tabernacle
[1:17:24] because it ain't about man's ideas it's
[1:17:27] not about uh kingdom building and all
[1:17:29] these other things it's about preaching
[1:17:31] the gospel it's about preaching the word
[1:17:33] that paul preached it's about preaching
[1:17:35] the word that iranians preached and all
[1:17:37] these different measures down through
[1:17:38] the ages it's about preaching that same
[1:17:40] word and that's what we're doing you're
[1:17:42] a special group of people to be
[1:17:44] privileged to hear what the spirit is
[1:17:46] saying in this hour
[1:17:51] in the spirit revelations 22 and verse
[1:17:53] 17 the spirit and the bride are saying
[1:17:55] something
[1:17:57] they're not saying two different things
[1:18:00] they're saying the same thing
[1:18:02] they're saying come
[1:18:04] they're saying that's the same word it's
[1:18:06] the same message they're not saying come
[1:18:07] to my group
[1:18:10] i'm not saying come to my church they're
[1:18:12] just saying come
[1:18:14] come come and receive of the waters of
[1:18:16] life
[1:18:17] come and taste and see what is being
[1:18:19] preached that is the realities of a
[1:18:21] living god
[1:18:23] notice each age had its own elect and
[1:18:25] that alleged group always heard the word
[1:18:28] and received it proving that they had
[1:18:30] the seed in them
[1:18:34] but there are so many voices in the land
[1:18:36] today
[1:18:37] some of you got your iphones handy
[1:18:40] that's a voice
[1:18:41] got your ipad handy that's a voice
[1:18:44] some of you got those special anointed
[1:18:46] monitors at home to pick up hulu and
[1:18:48] netflix and all these other things
[1:18:50] that's a voice
[1:18:51] you got your reels and you got all these
[1:18:52] other little things you got your all
[1:18:54] that social media stuff that's a voice
[1:18:57] and all these voices are vying for your
[1:18:59] attention
[1:19:01] all of them i like how brother ham he
[1:19:04] really thumped you young people a while
[1:19:05] back
[1:19:06] talking about all these rules y'all got
[1:19:07] all these little songs you would never
[1:19:09] turn to the country western station i
[1:19:11] mean country western country music
[1:19:12] station and your rock station and your
[1:19:14] rap station on your radio but you got
[1:19:16] all these reels and you just sing along
[1:19:18] happy-go-lucky thinking everything's
[1:19:19] hunky-dory
[1:19:20] it's a voice
[1:19:23] don't be gluten that you know all that
[1:19:25] garbage
[1:19:28] you should be ashamed you're exactly
[1:19:30] right
[1:19:31] but it's a voice
[1:19:33] and that voice is vying for your
[1:19:34] attention and so is the voice of our
[1:19:37] beloved
[1:19:38] he's vying for your attention
[1:19:41] he's vine he has come service after
[1:19:44] service he has nudged you he has moved
[1:19:46] upon you he has done everything he can
[1:19:48] to get you to respond to the word
[1:19:53] you'll notice the last warning in
[1:19:54] laodicea
[1:19:56] that he that had the ears to hear
[1:19:58] let them hear what the spirit is saying
[1:20:02] oh revelations 10 7. i'm gonna start
[1:20:03] wrapping this up i'm not closing i'm
[1:20:05] descending
[1:20:06] i flew out to arizona and i flew back
[1:20:08] and before i landed they told me where
[1:20:10] we're going to start our descend
[1:20:13] i said all right you know what they do
[1:20:14] when they descend they pull back the
[1:20:15] throttle and they slow down a little bit
[1:20:16] i can't promise you that
[1:20:18] we're going to start our descent but in
[1:20:21] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:20:22] angel when he
[1:20:24] shall begin to sound the mystery of god
[1:20:26] should be finished as he has declared
[1:20:28] into his servants the prophets notice
[1:20:30] now verse 8 and the voice which i heard
[1:20:32] john is hearing a voice
[1:20:34] this ain't the voice of a man
[1:20:37] john is hearing a voice which i heard
[1:20:39] from heaven spake unto me and said go
[1:20:41] and take the little book which is open
[1:20:44] in the hand of the angel we stand upon
[1:20:45] the sea and upon the earth and i went
[1:20:48] unto the angel and i said unto him give
[1:20:50] me the little book and they said unto me
[1:20:52] take it and eat it up and it shall make
[1:20:54] thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[1:20:56] mouth sweet as honey and i took the
[1:20:58] little book out of the angel's hand and
[1:21:00] i ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[1:21:02] as honey and as soon as i had eaten it
[1:21:04] my belly was bitter and he said unto me
[1:21:07] thou must prophesy again before many
[1:21:09] peoples nations tongues and kings
[1:21:13] now the seventh angel has already
[1:21:15] sounded
[1:21:17] i hope none of you are looking for the
[1:21:19] eighth messenger
[1:21:21] he's already sounded he's not coming
[1:21:24] back to finish
[1:21:25] he's already preached his message
[1:21:28] and let me just tell you and we have
[1:21:29] already received it
[1:21:31] all right
[1:21:32] that voice behind him sound it wasn't
[1:21:35] that seventh angel when he began to
[1:21:36] sound it was a voice sounding out from
[1:21:38] him he received that revelation from god
[1:21:41] and he delivered that revelation to the
[1:21:43] elect
[1:21:44] now let me just show you can i show you
[1:21:46] something here that this message message
[1:21:49] was not the message of a prophet
[1:21:51] of william branham it wasn't his message
[1:21:54] i want to show you there's a quote here
[1:21:56] wow here it is looking to the unseen
[1:21:58] while you're standing on your feet you
[1:21:59] can stay seated
[1:22:01] brother mike if you want to get up i saw
[1:22:02] you about to get up you're welcome
[1:22:06] just kidding
[1:22:07] he says now while you're standing on
[1:22:09] your feet praising god how many wants
[1:22:12] you that raised your hands a while ago
[1:22:13] believes that god will hear my prayer
[1:22:15] for your salvation of your soul now come
[1:22:17] walking down here now as we sing and i
[1:22:20] will praise him i will praise him come
[1:22:22] on walk right down the aisles here now
[1:22:24] right down to receive jesus keep your
[1:22:26] hands up keep looking at to the unseen
[1:22:29] that little pulsation in your heart come
[1:22:31] moving right on down he's pulsating to
[1:22:34] you i'm the lord that raised up christ
[1:22:36] from the grave i'm the one that sent the
[1:22:39] holy ghost i'm the one that give the
[1:22:41] promise brother branham has nothing to
[1:22:43] do with this i have he surrendered his
[1:22:46] life to me i'm using his spirit i'm
[1:22:48] talking through his lips that's me i'm
[1:22:52] the lord i'm telling he didn't receive
[1:22:54] this message of himself and when he was
[1:22:57] going to open the seals when he was to
[1:22:58] go down there he said the angel the lord
[1:23:00] met him in the closet he would have made
[1:23:02] a horrible mistake what am i telling you
[1:23:05] church we didn't receive the message
[1:23:06] from a man but we have heard from the
[1:23:09] voice of god in this hour
[1:23:12] you have heard that supernatural voice
[1:23:15] and it declares to you tonight that you
[1:23:17] are a supernatural people
[1:23:22] and that voice is given instructions
[1:23:24] take the book
[1:23:25] eat the book
[1:23:27] become the book
[1:23:28] prophesy again where you say well the
[1:23:30] message was only for the prophet no it
[1:23:32] wasn't only for the prophet he said the
[1:23:34] anointed man now the anointed people
[1:23:37] the anointed man now the anointed people
[1:23:40] you got a responsibility
[1:23:42] you've got a responsibility to let this
[1:23:44] message live out through your life let
[1:23:47] it manifest let it be a living voice
[1:23:50] because you have heard the voice of god
[1:23:55] this bride
[1:23:56] has heard from her beloved she has taken
[1:23:59] that book she has eaten that book and
[1:24:01] she
[1:24:02] is prophesying
[1:24:05] she is prophesying that's why you can
[1:24:07] come and stand here and you can walk
[1:24:09] away delivered you can come and stand
[1:24:11] here and you can walk away healed you
[1:24:14] can stand here and you can have demons
[1:24:15] cast out of you
[1:24:17] because this bride has taken that book
[1:24:20] and she's become the word for this hour
[1:24:23] not because she heard the man's voice
[1:24:25] let me just say this if you only heard
[1:24:27] the voice of william branham you missed
[1:24:29] it
[1:24:32] if you only have heard that and that's
[1:24:34] all this message means to you i'm sorry
[1:24:37] to disappoint you at such a late hour
[1:24:40] but you have missed it look we didn't we
[1:24:42] are not falling in love with william
[1:24:44] branham we didn't fall in love with
[1:24:45] eleazar but we have fallen in love with
[1:24:48] isaac the one that he told us about the
[1:24:50] one that he showed us about the one that
[1:24:51] he made complaining to us he had told us
[1:24:54] about his goodness he told us about his
[1:24:55] mercy he's told us about us and we had
[1:24:58] fallen in love with what he told us
[1:25:00] about not the man that's taking us to
[1:25:02] our bridegroom but we fall in love with
[1:25:04] the bridegroom and it's our church
[1:25:07] we will appreciate the man we appreciate
[1:25:09] the ministry but i didn't fall in love
[1:25:11] with him i fell in love with my isaac
[1:25:16] but that's the problem with so many
[1:25:17] people they got their eyes on a man
[1:25:20] and they deify the man
[1:25:23] and when you deify the man you miss the
[1:25:24] voice of god
[1:25:26] you can't hear the voice because all you
[1:25:28] hear is the voice of a man that's why so
[1:25:30] many multitudes are pushing play because
[1:25:32] they refuse to hear the voice of the
[1:25:34] fivefold ministry
[1:25:36] the voice of god
[1:25:38] i have established pastors preachers
[1:25:40] teachers of endless and missionaries
[1:25:43] god established that that's his voice
[1:25:47] he didn't have to get to the seventh
[1:25:48] hour the seventh age and back up and
[1:25:50] change his program
[1:25:51] because the fiffo ministry can't
[1:25:53] straighten it out
[1:25:56] and now we gotta push play no you're
[1:25:58] hearing the wrong voice
[1:26:00] i'm not trying to be hurtful but i'm
[1:26:01] just trying to be plain we got to hear
[1:26:03] the voice
[1:26:04] of god
[1:26:08] revelation 3 and verse 20.
[1:26:10] we're slow pulling back one more time
[1:26:12] here
[1:26:14] behold i stand at the door and knock
[1:26:16] if any man here
[1:26:19] if any man will attend to my voice
[1:26:22] i will open the door and i will come
[1:26:24] into him and i will sup with him and he
[1:26:26] with me and to him that overcometh will
[1:26:28] i grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:26:30] even as i also overcame and i am set
[1:26:33] down with my father in his throne he
[1:26:36] that hath an ear let them hear let them
[1:26:38] attend let them perceive let them
[1:26:41] understand let them take knowledge of
[1:26:43] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:26:48] he's compelling everyone
[1:26:50] if you can hear tonight
[1:26:53] open the door
[1:26:55] if you can hear tonight
[1:26:57] open the door
[1:26:58] see god uses man man is god's vessel
[1:27:01] we'll may pick that up at another time
[1:27:03] but let me bring this down
[1:27:04] now start bringing us down to a close
[1:27:08] but before we do brother brown will say
[1:27:09] he is veiled with natural available for
[1:27:11] he could speak the word to the people
[1:27:13] now god has to veil himself as to as he
[1:27:17] promised in human flesh
[1:27:22] i'm looking at god tonight
[1:27:23] but he's filled in a lot of different
[1:27:25] forms
[1:27:28] some short
[1:27:30] some tall
[1:27:32] we ain't gonna go no further
[1:27:34] we good we ain't gonna pick on none of
[1:27:36] y'all
[1:27:37] me and aaron right here tonight
[1:27:39] but we're all different but yet he's
[1:27:41] veiled right here tonight
[1:27:43] think about it
[1:27:45] the voice
[1:27:46] almighty god has failed in your humanity
[1:27:49] but many times we get hung up brother
[1:27:51] hearing on this
[1:27:54] some of you get hung up on the veil
[1:27:57] you get hung up because you know what he
[1:28:00] ain't my favorite preacher
[1:28:02] and then
[1:28:03] because you come in with such an
[1:28:05] attitude he missed the voice
[1:28:09] well he's too loud he's too evangelistic
[1:28:13] you missed the voice
[1:28:15] or per adventure he's too boring
[1:28:18] puts me to sleep you missed a voice
[1:28:22] oh let's put it like this one because
[1:28:23] this is a good one
[1:28:26] you get closer to a preacher
[1:28:28] you begin to know that preacher ain't
[1:28:29] perfect
[1:28:32] how many of you out here are perfect
[1:28:34] i got a notetaker don't you even think
[1:28:36] about it
[1:28:38] this ain't time for mississippi to come
[1:28:40] out
[1:28:42] none of us are perfect
[1:28:44] but yet we put the ministry
[1:28:47] right up here
[1:28:49] in the perfect part of the pyramid
[1:28:52] the pps perfect preachers right there i
[1:28:56] just made that up and it fit perfect
[1:29:00] and then when that preacher you see his
[1:29:02] humanity
[1:29:04] oh you see things in his home
[1:29:07] you see things that he's doing or maybe
[1:29:09] his kids are doing maybe his wife is
[1:29:11] doing and all of a sudden he stands
[1:29:12] behind this sacred desk and he's
[1:29:14] preaching
[1:29:15] contrary to what's being done at home
[1:29:17] you don't receive
[1:29:21] because you're focused on the man
[1:29:23] you're focused on the veil and you miss
[1:29:25] the voice
[1:29:29] i know it's hard i know it's difficult
[1:29:31] but it's the truth
[1:29:33] you got to separate the vessel
[1:29:35] and you got to separate the veil from
[1:29:37] the voice
[1:29:38] and say god i come to hear from you
[1:29:39] tonight
[1:29:41] he may not be your favorite preacher he
[1:29:43] may have the worst delivery
[1:29:45] his voice may just make your blood crawl
[1:29:50] don't you amen that
[1:29:53] good lord we're traveling together
[1:29:57] but yet what do we come to the house of
[1:29:58] god for
[1:30:00] to hear the voice
[1:30:01] listen
[1:30:02] to
[1:30:03] the
[1:30:04] voice you know
[1:30:10] let's go on
[1:30:13] whoa let's go on let's bring this down
[1:30:16] home y'all ready to bring this home
[1:30:17] we're going to land this plane

[1:30:23] lord willing in the future
[1:30:26] yeah i'm missing a lot here
[1:30:28] two attorneys were in alaska

[1:30:32] story

[1:30:41] it's okay
[1:30:42] i'm not going to condemn you for
[1:30:43] listening to him he's a good man
[1:30:45] he was over in alaska in the lucian
[1:30:47] islands and he was doing him and another
[1:30:49] attorney were doing a lawsuit and they
[1:30:51] were getting ready to leave the lucian
[1:30:53] islands come back to anchorage alaska
[1:30:54] and then head home and he had a ticket
[1:30:56] in his pocket and this pastor came up to
[1:30:58] him said look i can save you a bunch of
[1:31:00] money he said well how's that he says i

[1:31:09] back to anchorage and save that ticket
[1:31:11] you can use it another time
[1:31:14] and he's like
[1:31:15] he dwelled on it for a minute and he
[1:31:17] said against my better adjustment i
[1:31:19] agreed
[1:31:22] so they went out to the airport

[1:37:32] ones some of you got kids out in the
[1:37:34] world you get distracted by those things
[1:37:36] and you start dwelling on those things
[1:37:38] and you look away from the voice
[1:37:41] but sometimes you need a service to pull
[1:37:42] you right back into it
[1:37:44] energize your faith
[1:37:47] he says now i don't want you to look at
[1:37:49] what's going on the outside i don't want

[1:38:36] they did
[1:38:37] these other other uh airplane pilots

[1:38:52] the voice that's the key just stay with
[1:38:54] the voice he says do you realize your

[1:39:21] daughter again you're never going to
[1:39:22] tell them you love them
[1:39:25] voices
[1:39:27] voices
[1:39:29] all of them trying to be the controlling
[1:39:31] voice
[1:39:34] but god says i want you to be a living
[1:39:36] sacrifice
[1:39:37] i want you to lay yourself on the altar
[1:39:39] and let my voice be your voice
[1:39:44] die daily
[1:39:46] allow him to speak through you allow him
[1:39:49] to look away from the chaos around us
[1:39:51] and position you back to the word
[1:39:54] so they went through the worst of the
[1:39:55] weather but there was still more to come
[1:39:57] and the voice came back and says now i'm
[1:39:58] going to line you up

[1:40:17] see just yet about 200 feet
[1:40:20] they saw the lights
[1:40:22] he says now at the end of the runway
[1:40:24] there's a cross because i want you to
[1:40:26] remember this the cross is the way home
[1:40:29] god don't make mistakes church

[1:40:35] this the cross is the way home and he's
[1:40:38] bringing them down and they still can't
[1:40:39] see anything and yet he kept telling

[1:40:50] even when you don't feel god he's saying
[1:40:52] stay with me
[1:40:54] even when you find it hard to trust him
[1:40:55] he's saying stay with me
[1:40:58] and just a couple hundred feet off the
[1:40:59] ground they saw the cross and the
[1:41:00] attorney
[1:41:02] or david gibbs he said i landed that
[1:41:03] plane
[1:41:04] he said in fact i landed it seven times
[1:41:09] he bounced all down that runway he said
[1:41:11] when finally when i brought that plane
[1:41:13] to a stop the pilot woke up
[1:41:18] but an anchorage emergency came on the
[1:41:20] other end he said thanks for listening
[1:41:23] to the voice
[1:41:25] he said thanks for listening to the
[1:41:27] voice because i watched him crash and
[1:41:30] burn all the time because they won't
[1:41:32] follow my voice
[1:41:35] they don't understand that i'm the one
[1:41:36] that can see them they can't see me
[1:41:38] they get all these voices in their head
[1:41:40] and they kill themselves they
[1:41:41] self-destruct and he said thanks
