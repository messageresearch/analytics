[43:59] reasoning uh reasoning is the action or
[44:03] thinking about something in a logical or
[44:06] sensible way it's to reason is to think
[44:10] or to understand or to form judgments by
[44:13] the process of logic in other words just
[44:16] to think rationally or logically or to
[44:19] think straight to use one's mind to use
[44:22] common sense to use one's head or one's
[44:26] brain to think things through to
[44:28] intellectualize or to put a thinking cap
[44:31] on so to speak or to calculate or to
[44:34] come to a conclusion or to reckon or to
[44:38] consider you know there's nothing wrong
[44:40] with having intellectual abilities if we
[44:43] didn't have our mind or our brain our
[44:45] body would not function as we know it
[44:48] today you know and of course there's not
[44:50] nothing wrong anything wrong with having
[44:52] Common Sense we we know the world seems
[44:54] to be lacking in common sense today and
[44:57] you know brother Brandon would even
[44:58] speak a couple of times about putting on
[45:00] your thinking cap or your spiritual
[45:02] thinking cap you know mental
[45:04] capabilities are good unless they rise
[45:08] above the word of God uh and when you
[45:11] begin to reason the word of God and you
[45:13] exalt your thoughts above the word of
[45:15] God that's where you get in trouble amen
[45:17] there's not nothing wrong with thinking
[45:19] about something or or or reasoning it
[45:21] out or talking about it but when you got
[45:23] to make sure that the word of God is
[45:25] always above what you think feel taste
[45:28] smell hear whatever all these Earthly
[45:30] senses and so amen Paul would speak
[45:33] about it in 2 Corinthians he would say
[45:35] casting down imaginations and every High
[45:38] thing that exalt itself against the
[45:40] knowledge of God and bringing into
[45:42] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[45:45] of Christ and so when we have thoughts
[45:47] and things in our mind amen it's very
[45:49] important that we bring it subject to
[45:52] what the word of God says because the
[45:54] word of God should be the most uh uh the
[45:57] highest uh form of judgment that there
[45:59] is in our lives amen Satan but Satan's
[46:02] reasoning in his way of reasoning he
[46:04] wants us to put our thoughts above what
[46:07] the word says he wants us to put our
[46:10] feelings or our emotions above what the
[46:12] word says amen he he God but God also
[46:16] calls us to reason he would say in
[46:18] Isaiah 18 and verse 20 come now and let
[46:21] us reason together sayeth the Lord amen
[46:23] but he calls us to put the word above
[46:26] our thoughts Amen to put what God has
[46:29] said above what we think or what we see
[46:32] or what's going on in our life and this
[46:34] is what he says come now and let us
[46:35] reason together sayeth the Lord though
[46:38] your sins be as Scarlet they shall be
[46:40] white as snow and though they be red
[46:42] like Crimson they shall be as wool if
[46:45] you be willing and obedient you shall
[46:46] eat of the good of the lamb but if you
[46:49] refuse and rebel you shall be devoured
[46:50] with a sword for the mouth of the Lord
[46:53] has spoken and notice where he brings
[46:55] these thoughts back to to the word of
[46:57] God what I have spoke it shall come to
[47:00] pass amen so he's saying let us reason
[47:03] let us judge this but let us judge it by
[47:05] what the word says not by what our
[47:07] feelings or what our situation speaks
[47:10] about us but by what the word says about
[47:12] us amen amen in other words you can read
[47:15] the scripture and this is very beautiful
[47:16] I was just reading in the back very
[47:18] quickly as I before I come out and and
[47:20] and we find that Judah had sinned and
[47:22] they' went away from God and he speaks
[47:24] about their sin and their wrong and he
[47:26] says but I have a blood you sinned
[47:29] you've done wrong but I have a blood
[47:32] that's going to make your sins white as
[47:34] snow amen you've Fallen but I will
[47:37] restore amen you've done wrong but I'm
[47:39] going to make your wrongs right again
[47:42] amen and after I'm done you shall be
[47:44] called the city of righteousness the
[47:46] faithful City amen that's a wonderful
[47:49] thing that God even though we've done
[47:50] wrong even though we' Fallen amen God
[47:53] says don't look at that don't look at
[47:54] the feelings that it's caused but look
[47:56] what what my word has declared about you
[47:59] that I'm going to raise you up out of
[48:01] your sin and I'm going to make you white
[48:03] as snow amen but the serpent was there
[48:06] reasoning with Eve and you know you know
[48:08] saying you know God's too good God God's
[48:10] a merciful god he he loves you too much
[48:13] you you know you he won't he won't let
[48:15] you die see he said that's the same old
[48:17] devil today God's too good to do this
[48:19] God won't do that God won't punish this
[48:22] God will do exactly what his word said
[48:25] he will do God will do exactly what his
[48:28] word said he would do now I don't know
[48:30] about you but I'm thankful to serve a
[48:31] god like that I I've said it before I
[48:34] couldn't imagine servant of God who had
[48:36] one thought today and another thought
[48:38] tomorrow or or said one word today and
[48:42] as men do or politicians do have you
[48:44] know make promises but they never come
[48:46] to pass amen but I'm thankful I'm not
[48:48] serving a god like that that if he spoke
[48:51] it he's going to do what he said he's
[48:52] going to do if he promised it he's going
[48:54] to bring his promises to pass every
[48:57] devil in hell may try to stop it every
[48:59] devil in hell may try to hinder it it
[49:01] may try to amen try to slow it down but
[49:04] that word will come to pass it will be
[49:07] fulfilled amen you know people are all
[49:09] excited about Trump you know he he's
[49:11] fulfilling campaign promises you know
[49:13] one of the first one of the first
[49:15] presidents we've ever had is doing what
[49:17] he said he's going to do amen and
[49:19] they're getting all upset about it but
[49:20] he told him what he's going to do I
[49:21] thought about that you know that's
[49:23] amazing that we have a God that's made
[49:25] promises and they've laid there for
[49:28] thousands of years and men's pondered
[49:30] about him they reasoned about him they
[49:31] looked at him they wondered but God said
[49:34] it he's going to bring it to pass and it
[49:36] ain't a president making campaign
[49:38] promises it's a god whose word will
[49:41] never fail it'll never return into void
[49:44] but it will accomplish what he said it
[49:46] would do amen so if he said it it's
[49:49] going to happen amen you shall he said
[49:51] then but the serpent said You shall not
[49:54] surely die see he added one word to the
[49:56] that phrase amen you shall surely die
[49:59] you shall not surely die that's what he
[50:01] tries to do just get you to add one
[50:03] little word to the word of God Amen cuz
[50:06] he knows if you had to or take away amen
[50:09] amen it strips the power of the word
[50:12] that's been
[50:13] given amen so what's he trying to do
[50:16] he's get trying to get her to reason
[50:18] with him and the minute that you reason
[50:21] with God's word you lose
[50:24] Faith the minute you put your thought
[50:27] above what the word of God says you lose
[50:29] Faith amen you don't you don't have no
[50:32] yes NOS maybe St but you have to stay
[50:34] right with what the word said but the
[50:36] serpent said to the woman ye shall not
[50:39] surely die for God knoweth the days you
[50:41] eat thereof and then your eyes are going
[50:43] to be open and you'll be as Gods knowing
[50:46] good and evil see he was giv her a
[50:48] reason wouldn't it be nice to be equal
[50:51] with God wouldn't it be amazing to be
[50:54] able to know what God knows wouldn't it
[50:56] be be amazing to have his abilities and
[50:59] to be able to do this is what he was
[51:01] offering her this reasoning Amen to take
[51:03] what he said when you hear that when you
[51:06] hear Satan coming to you like that he
[51:08] says get away from it that is the HS of
[51:11] the serpent it might sound reasonable
[51:14] but don't reason with it just believe
[51:16] what God
[51:17] Said Hallelujah when the woman saw that
[51:21] the tree was good for food see what it
[51:23] was his reasoning brought her to know
[51:26] that it was that it was right that was
[51:28] there that was pleasant to the eye and a
[51:30] tree to be desired to make one what Have
[51:32] Faith No to have one more knowledge no
[51:35] to make one wise see what it was Satan
[51:37] presenting knowledge knowing that it was
[51:40] contrary to the word there's nothing
[51:42] wrong with knowledge as long as it lines
[51:45] up with the word amen this is where
[51:48] where they get they get people in the in
[51:50] in these institutions of of learning
[51:52] amen because they put things above what
[51:55] the word said amen and they get people
[51:57] all tore up and when they put things
[51:59] above what the word says see their eyes
[52:02] were open and they knew they were naked
[52:04] amen with reasoning Faith though has no
[52:07] reason you don't reason at all you just
[52:10] believe when you prayed for you accept
[52:12] God's word for healing and you don't
[52:14] reason it with your feelings or do I
[52:16] feel better do I not feel better it has
[52:18] nothing to do with that I believe what
[52:21] his word said he said they shall lay
[52:23] hands upon the sick and they shall
[52:25] recover it doesn't matter if I feel it
[52:28] today or I feel it next week or I feel
[52:30] it in a month it matters not I believe
[52:32] what God's word
[52:34] said amen so we see here amen he's
[52:37] always trying to get you to doubt what
[52:40] God Said God said you're a child of his
[52:43] God called you a son God called you amen
[52:46] a child of God but Satan is always there
[52:49] to try to put reasonings there well if I
[52:52] was his son I wouldn't have faults I
[52:54] wouldn't have failures I wouldn't make
[52:55] mistakes I wouldn't f all that does not
[52:58] have nothing to do with being a son or
[53:01] not amen you know when I yeah I kind of
[53:06] got in the fields a little bit today if
[53:07] that's the way you can say it I seen a
[53:09] picture of me and my two little boys
[53:11] they're not two little boys no more
[53:12] they're they're they're grown men but at
[53:15] one Andrew was giving me a hug and a
[53:16] kiss and Luke's standing there next to
[53:18] me but you know as a father I tried to
[53:20] keep them from harm and and dangers but
[53:23] they were walk many times they were
[53:25] walking beside me and and they might
[53:28] fall but it wasn't my fault they fell
[53:31] right come on it wasn't what I done
[53:34] cause them to fall but as a child
[53:36] learning they fail they they made
[53:38] mistakes they they did things wrong amen
[53:41] many times people look at God and say
[53:43] why would God allow the things to happen
[53:45] the way they've happened amen and and
[53:47] God's right here beside us why would he
[53:50] allow amen for things to happen why
[53:52] because he wants to show amen those
[53:55] times that you fall those times that you
[53:57] have troubles and those times you have
[53:59] sicknesses that he's there to heal you
[54:01] he's there to lift you up he's there to
[54:03] comfort you just as a Earthly father
[54:05] when a little child would fall down his
[54:07] skin his knees every father in here
[54:09] would go to him and say okay son it's
[54:11] going to be all right let me Pat you up
[54:13] a little bit let me take that old dirt
[54:14] off of there that's what the father does
[54:17] though your sins be as Scarlet they
[54:19] shall be white as snow amen amen but
[54:22] Satan wants to come and say well God
[54:24] doesn't care about you God doesn't care
[54:26] about the things you're going through
[54:28] there he is standing right next to you
[54:30] and you're having troubles and you're
[54:31] having calamities and you're having
[54:33] sicknesses amen but that does not change
[54:36] who God is God's word will come to pass
[54:40] he will fulfill his
[54:42] word but it's Satan trying to get you to
[54:45] doubt amen what God is doing even now in
[54:48] your heart Amen brother brandom had this
[54:50] he had mind battles aren't you thankful
[54:52] amen the prophet of God had mind battles
[54:54] uh Elijah had mind battle every man
[54:57] every human Jesus himself had mind
[55:01] battles amen so he talks about the
[55:04] vision that was given of the grizzly
[55:05] bear and the caribou and and he said you
[55:08] know he G Lord gives a vision
[55:10] something's going to happen he says you
[55:12] know he said I don't matter what happens
[55:13] contrary it doesn't matter but Satan
[55:16] will always try to present something
[55:18] he'll try to reason and say Well it
[55:20] can't happen and said when we got there
[55:22] the God said well I never seen a silver
[55:24] tip in this area besides we're going up
[55:27] to where the Sheep country is on horses
[55:29] there's there's no Cil ta you ain't
[55:31] going to get it there see trying to move
[55:33] us away from a vision reason trying to
[55:37] move us away Satan said to me he said
[55:39] well see you must just have
[55:41] misunderstood the
[55:44] vision you must have just misunderstood
[55:47] the vision that this is going to take
[55:49] place he said but I didn't it's going to
[55:51] be thus sayith the Lord and when the
[55:54] caribo come up and we got that which was
[55:56] in the vision as you know and he God
[55:58] said to me very fine brother amen he
[56:01] said brother Brandon my brother had
[56:02] epilepsy rode up on a horse that day and
[56:04] told me how to do a certain thing my
[56:06] brother epilepsia would cease and when I
[56:08] did exactly what the Holy Spirit told me
[56:10] to do he's never had a spell from that
[56:12] he said but now we're at the top of this
[56:14] mountain and three miles down there's
[56:16] not even Bush a bush 4 Ines High nothing
[56:19] but Caribou Moss a few blueberries they
[56:21] only get 2 or three inches high hey
[56:24] there's no room for a Grizzly to be
[56:25] anywhere where and you're going to shoot
[56:27] and kill a 9 foot Silver Tip grizzly
[56:30] bear I said that's thus sayith the Lord
[56:33] but what was it Satan was trying to get
[56:37] me to disbelieve
[56:39] it he was trying to make even the
[56:42] conversation come around the brother
[56:44] just as innocent maybe as he could be he
[56:46] was just pointing out what's true I mean
[56:48] it's facts there ain't no Bush High
[56:50] Enough there ain't no blue the
[56:52] blueberries the Caribou Mo Moss it can't
[56:54] hide No 9 foot care uh grizzly bear amen
[56:58] but it didn't matter amen what we're
[57:00] talking about amen the God who creates
[57:02] squirrels The God Who could create
[57:05] something out of
[57:07] nothing amen this whole world we walk
[57:09] around on every day was created out of
[57:14] nothing amen so Satan will always try to
[57:17] bring a conversation around to get you
[57:20] to doubt what God's doing in your
[57:24] life amen that's why we got to be
[57:27] careful of what we're talking about and
[57:28] how we're talking about things amen what
[57:30] is it Satan trying to get you to
[57:33] reason that's what he does around
[57:35] conversations and uh and things around
[57:37] in just living rooms around families or
[57:40] friends you know we get to talk about
[57:41] this and that pretty soon we're bringing
[57:43] up this trouble over here that trouble
[57:44] over there what's he trying to do he's
[57:46] trying to get you to bring doubt and
[57:48] reasonings amen well there you know well
[57:51] I mean there there's got to be better
[57:53] better churches than what we got and all
[57:54] these kind of things what was he trying
[57:56] to do bring doubts and reasonings just
[57:59] by conversation he said are you doubting
[58:03] Bud well we're only a mile from where we
[58:06] got to be are you doubting not at
[58:10] all well there ain't no moss and there
[58:12] ain't no ain't nothing tall enough to
[58:14] are you dialing bud not at
[58:17] all I mean he just told the testimony of
[58:20] how his brother had epilepsy you know
[58:23] the story and he and brother Bram told
[58:25] him said when he goes into that fit take
[58:27] his shirt off throw it in the fire and
[58:29] he'll not have it again and it happened
[58:31] exactly as a prophet said it
[58:33] would so he had this testimony he knew
[58:37] this wasn't just somebody some fly my
[58:39] night preacher that came but it was a
[58:41] man who had told him the truth and it
[58:43] had come to pass and yet in still in his
[58:46] mind he's trying to think about how in
[58:48] the world will this happen see amen
[58:51] Satan is always trying to get your
[58:53] thoughts to be higher than what God's
[58:55] thoughts are are but the vision is
[58:58] higher than the
[58:59] thought it's going to come to
[59:02] pass amen see we got well we got a half
[59:05] a mile now we only half that's right
[59:07] just think in a half a
[59:09] mile look we can see right before
[59:12] there's nothing out there I said but the
[59:14] lord gave me the word he can create one
[59:18] where he wants one see you don't reason
[59:20] just believe it don't pay any attention
[59:22] to reason there's nothing to it at all
[59:24] just believe what God said that's all
[59:27] and I'm standing there looking at up on
[59:29] the Hills everywhere yellow Caribou Moss
[59:31] sun going down Hills are beautiful you
[59:34] could see any little spot anywhere for
[59:35] three miles up the mountain above me and
[59:37] around me when I looked about two miles
[59:40] ahead of me a mile and a half two miles
[59:41] stood a 9- foot Silver Tip Grizzly how
[59:45] he got there I don't know but he was
[59:49] there see that's exactly how the
[59:52] promises of God will come to pass in
[59:54] your life how it comes to pass I don't
[59:57] know but if you'll keep believing it'll
[59:59] be there it'll come out of nothing when
[1:00:02] it seems impossible and it seems like
[1:00:05] there ain't no hope whatsoever but the
[1:00:07] God who can create squirrels and flies
[1:00:10] and gats and frogs and create this whole
[1:00:13] universe out of nothing it's a god who's
[1:00:16] in control of every situation you go
[1:00:19] through he's in control of your children
[1:00:21] he's in control of your family he's in
[1:00:23] control of it all I don't know how he's
[1:00:27] going to do it I just know he said he
[1:00:29] would he said it I believe
[1:00:38] it see no matter what the circumstances
[1:00:41] are don't pay attention to
[1:00:45] circumstances God said the day you eat
[1:00:47] thereof that day you die Satan said well
[1:00:49] let me tell you something God's we say
[1:00:53] God's true sure that's right we believe
[1:00:54] the word okay I believe that real sure
[1:00:57] but listen let me tell you he didn't
[1:01:00] exactly mean
[1:01:03] that he didn't exactly mean that he did
[1:01:08] mean that he meant exactly what he
[1:01:12] said see over there look I tell you why
[1:01:15] he did it see you're not really wise yet
[1:01:18] you got you ain't got any wisdom you
[1:01:20] just like a sheep to be led to the
[1:01:22] slaughter you're not your own you know
[1:01:24] that's the way God wants you
[1:01:26] you ain't got no PhD yet you ain't got
[1:01:28] noed enough education yet but I've got
[1:01:31] wisdom and I'll prove it to you now look
[1:01:33] you don't know what's right and wrong
[1:01:35] you don't know there's such a thing but
[1:01:37] you do know what it is see let me show
[1:01:39] you how it's done that's all he wanted
[1:01:41] to tell that woman that's all he wanted
[1:01:43] to do let me show you how it's done she
[1:01:45] said but we'll die but surely God
[1:01:48] wouldn't do
[1:01:49] that he knows that you'll be wise too
[1:01:52] see he was putting his wisdom above or
[1:01:55] against the word of God that's the
[1:01:57] wisdom that we're talking about amen
[1:01:59] it's the wisdom that tries to come
[1:02:01] against your
[1:02:04] faith amen it's not it's not even you
[1:02:07] know even your own thoughts it's Satan
[1:02:09] coming in placeing those thoughts inside
[1:02:11] of you and your mind and it's constantly
[1:02:14] battling why cuz he's trying to battle
[1:02:17] against the
[1:02:19] faith amen amen the first battle amen
[1:02:23] was right there God but God's word was
[1:02:25] true no matter what reasoning says and
[1:02:28] when they partook they the what was
[1:02:30] forbidden they
[1:02:33] died so we're not to reason knowledge
[1:02:36] and knowledge has reason and faith has
[1:02:38] no no reason Faith holds on to it you
[1:02:41] know we we we talk about the five senses
[1:02:44] and and we talk about the six sense but
[1:02:46] he brother Bram brings it down he says
[1:02:47] there's five senses that that that
[1:02:49] communicate with this Earthly body he
[1:02:51] said but there's two that comes to the
[1:02:54] soul he talks about faith faith and
[1:02:57] doubt and Satan tries to get in these
[1:03:00] mental faculties Amen to either to try
[1:03:02] to get into that realm of doubt in your
[1:03:05] in your soul because he knows and I'll
[1:03:07] get to it he knows eventually your your
[1:03:09] your ability to reason is going to be
[1:03:13] done come on you're going to lose this
[1:03:16] one day and he knows he's going to
[1:03:18] you're going to die and that mind's
[1:03:20] going to Decay but that soul is
[1:03:23] eternal and so he's trying to get down
[1:03:26] into that Soul amen what what if Abraham
[1:03:29] would have reasoned out all the things
[1:03:31] that went around him he had many reasons
[1:03:33] to
[1:03:34] reason first he was way old his wife was
[1:03:37] way past menop paa and and it seemed
[1:03:39] impossible for this to even come to pass
[1:03:41] totally impossible that's
[1:03:44] right but reason should have showed that
[1:03:48] that it can't happen but Faith showed
[1:03:51] that it
[1:03:53] could Hallelujah see Faith don't take
[1:03:56] reasonings Faith holds on to the word
[1:03:59] the word said I'm going to give you a
[1:04:03] seed amen somebody you know would say
[1:04:06] well I I believe well brother Rand I
[1:04:08] believe that's the truth you're saying
[1:04:09] he said but if I did that you know if I
[1:04:12] I if I believe really took what you
[1:04:14] teach I'd be begging I they'd kick me
[1:04:15] out of my church they he said they just
[1:04:17] had to kick me out nobody else would
[1:04:20] have me he he'll have
[1:04:22] you Hallelujah you can't live here
[1:04:25] forever you got to go there see Faith
[1:04:27] knows no reason it just Bel separates
[1:04:29] you from every tie you stay right with
[1:04:31] faith and reasoning to drop off now man
[1:04:34] can have intellectual
[1:04:36] Faith now we're going to go into this a
[1:04:38] little deeper man can have intellectual
[1:04:41] Faith that's where most Christians get
[1:04:43] today calling themselves Christian the
[1:04:45] reason you see such carrying on as you
[1:04:46] do under the name of Christianity
[1:04:48] because it's only intellectual Faith
[1:04:51] what do you mean intellectual Faith man
[1:04:53] believeth unto salvation faith by here
[1:04:56] and hearing the word he said now I could
[1:04:57] preach the word and you accept it and
[1:05:00] say that's all right I believe it well
[1:05:02] that that's no F if it no goes no
[1:05:03] further than that you'll never get very
[1:05:05] far with God that's intellectual Faith
[1:05:07] that's the reason why people doesn't get
[1:05:09] healed because of intellectual Faith
[1:05:12] their mind conceives it but then their
[1:05:14] mind will reason it
[1:05:18] away this is exactly what intellectual
[1:05:20] Faith amen toward salvation is they
[1:05:23] receive it in their mind but then alone
[1:05:26] comes Satan and he talks them out of
[1:05:29] it but if they can ever get it down on
[1:05:32] the depths of their soul they ain't no
[1:05:34] more talking out of it amen they ain't
[1:05:37] no more changing the heart they ain't no
[1:05:39] more changing what's on the inside it's
[1:05:42] done it's sealed until the day of their
[1:05:45] Redemption but as long as it stays as an
[1:05:48] intellectual conception and I believe it
[1:05:50] I believe it's the truth I believe it's
[1:05:52] right I believe this I believe what
[1:05:54] brother Timothy saying brother Jo
[1:05:56] brother Aon brother Tim I believe all of
[1:05:57] that but we want to go more than just
[1:06:00] this mental conception of the message or
[1:06:03] a mental conception of what a Christian
[1:06:05] is I come I come to the house of God
[1:06:07] because I'm a Christian I worship
[1:06:09] because I'm a Christian I do this
[1:06:10] because I'm a Christian and it just
[1:06:12] becomes nothing but a a intellectual
[1:06:15] conception of what God has required but
[1:06:18] God requires more than
[1:06:21] that come on amen amen Cain had an
[1:06:24] intellectual
[1:06:27] conception God had cursed the
[1:06:30] ground notice what Cain bring I was
[1:06:32] going to bring this down maybe we'll get
[1:06:34] into it again but I I'll just touch it
[1:06:35] for a moment Cain Cain God had cursed
[1:06:39] the ground but Cain had learned and
[1:06:42] Seasons Came Upon the Earth there used
[1:06:43] to be no Seasons right it was all green
[1:06:46] and beautiful but the fall came and
[1:06:48] Seasons happen and nature dies away then
[1:06:51] spring comes summer winter for all that
[1:06:54] and he learned by his natural abilities
[1:06:57] how to
[1:06:58] plant he learned how to grow he learned
[1:07:00] how to deal with adversities and weeds
[1:07:03] and all this stuff and this is what he
[1:07:05] brings to the altar was what he had
[1:07:10] learned amen what he had learned by
[1:07:12] intellectual abilities and be how to
[1:07:15] grow the best fruits and how to grow the
[1:07:17] best plants and the most beautiful thing
[1:07:19] and he's so proud of what he done and he
[1:07:21] brought what he had learned amen but
[1:07:23] Abel realized it wasn't on what he had
[1:07:26] learned what they had learned had got
[1:07:28] them out of the
[1:07:30] garden come on he saw what it took it
[1:07:33] took not what they had learned but what
[1:07:35] God had done for them and he saw that it
[1:07:38] wasn't his intellectual abilities that
[1:07:40] was needed it was the blood of the
[1:07:44] lamb and this is where people get in
[1:07:46] trouble they go as far as the
[1:07:48] intellectual conception and 20 years
[1:07:50] down the road they fall off somewhere
[1:07:52] why because they never came to the blood
[1:08:02] the reason people don't get healed
[1:08:04] because they have an intellectual view
[1:08:05] of what their mind conceives but then
[1:08:07] they'll leave the service and their mind
[1:08:09] will talk them right out of
[1:08:11] it their senses will cannot be I'm no
[1:08:14] better my senses of sight says I'm no
[1:08:16] arms no straighter my my feeling says I
[1:08:19] don't feel any better reasoning mental
[1:08:22] reasoning now wait a minute you say I
[1:08:25] believe that's foolishness see you're
[1:08:27] reasoning that's in what intellectual
[1:08:29] faith will do when once that faith comes
[1:08:32] down into this
[1:08:34] compartment the soul it'll never
[1:08:38] question
[1:08:39] again it's absolute fact it'll agree
[1:08:43] with every Divine word of God there's a
[1:08:46] reason people don't get to where they
[1:08:47] should be it because because it's a
[1:08:50] mental conception of God and when that
[1:08:52] but we believe we we believe in by
[1:08:54] intellectual Faith but that won't do it
[1:08:56] it's got to be a born again
[1:08:59] experience amen where your faith is
[1:09:02] brought down into the soul and no matter
[1:09:05] what it may look like out there faith
[1:09:07] says it's Soul
[1:09:11] anyhow he said there was going to be a
[1:09:13] 9- foot grizzly bear amen it isn't up to
[1:09:16] me to produce it it isn't up to me to
[1:09:18] bring it to pass he said so and if he
[1:09:21] said it I believe it but Satan's always
[1:09:25] there to bring all these thoughts and
[1:09:27] conversations to try to get you to doubt
[1:09:30] what God has done if you got good reason
[1:09:32] you'll sit down and try to reason out
[1:09:34] the
[1:09:35] Bible men have done it went insane how
[1:09:38] could this happen how could that happen
[1:09:39] how could this be over
[1:09:45] here people will get get all kind of
[1:09:47] thoughts tore up about a a fish swalling
[1:09:50] Jonah how could that be that you know
[1:09:53] anybody's just seen the news or whale
[1:09:55] swallowed that
[1:09:58] kayaker swallowed him and took him down
[1:10:00] next thing you know he pops up and his
[1:10:01] kayak pops
[1:10:04] up they said well see that I just showed
[1:10:07] you somebody had to comment you know
[1:10:09] everybody's got a comment nowadays and
[1:10:12] well I just shows you that Jonah
[1:10:13] couldn't have been swallowed by a whale
[1:10:15] really my Bible didn't say it was a
[1:10:17] whale say it was a
[1:10:19] fish so if you ask me it was a special
[1:10:21] kind of
[1:10:22] fish apparently it was very special for
[1:10:25] man man to live three days under
[1:10:28] there God can do whatever he wants to
[1:10:31] do whether you want to let him or not
[1:10:35] whether you want to believe him or not
[1:10:37] God's God you're not we're
[1:10:40] not amen so he
[1:10:43] creates somebody made this statement
[1:10:45] that me and brother Aaron laugh about it
[1:10:46] quite a bit said the B he said I believe
[1:10:48] the Bible said the Bible said Jonah got
[1:10:50] swallowed by a bluegill he said I'd say
[1:10:52] one big bluegill right
[1:10:58] that's where you got to be with God if
[1:11:00] God said it I don't care how ridiculous
[1:11:02] it is to this mental conception that I
[1:11:05] have or how I think or how I can draw it
[1:11:08] up amen people want to people want to
[1:11:11] put God in a box of a thousand years ago
[1:11:13] or 2,000 years ago or 60 years ago in
[1:11:16] their mental conception and draw him up
[1:11:18] a certain way and you know how they draw
[1:11:20] how they always brother BR talks about
[1:11:21] how they draw Samson and they make him
[1:11:23] this big muscular guy and and the
[1:11:25] prophet of God comes along and said he
[1:11:26] wasn't no big muscular guy he was a
[1:11:28] little old bitty
[1:11:30] shrimp well that goes against human
[1:11:32] reason cuz somehow this little shrimp
[1:11:35] got the gates of Gaza and carried it up
[1:11:37] to the
[1:11:38] hill what was it showing it wasn't by
[1:11:41] man's ability or man's strength it was
[1:11:43] by the spirit of God and this is where
[1:11:47] we got to come amen when it's not by
[1:11:49] might not by power but by the spirit of
[1:11:52] God it isn't by my intellectual
[1:11:54] abilities it it isn't about my human
[1:11:56] abilities it's about the ability of
[1:11:58] almighty God to bring his word to pass
[1:12:02] and if he said it I believe
[1:12:05] it sir you'll never know him by
[1:12:11] reasoning God is not known by reasoning
[1:12:13] he's known by faith you accept it you
[1:12:16] believe it you can't do it until
[1:12:18] something happens in you and that Holy
[1:12:20] Spirit comes in and then you have the
[1:12:23] mind of Christ Jesus was said no man
[1:12:26] cannot even understand the kingdom of
[1:12:28] God except that man be born again see
[1:12:32] that's the problem people don't come to
[1:12:33] that Born Again
[1:12:34] experience therefore they try to add two
[1:12:37] plus two and it don't always come up to
[1:12:39] four as we heard brother brother Joe
[1:12:41] preached on it for a long time God does
[1:12:43] impossible
[1:12:47] math 5 plus two does not feed
[1:12:52] 5,000 not with intellectual ability
[1:12:55] ities or thinking it ain't possible that
[1:12:57] as far as intellectual ability to
[1:13:00] believe or to think put it that way to
[1:13:03] think that five fishes and two loaves of
[1:13:05] bread is going to feed
[1:13:09] 5,000 is
[1:13:12] it come
[1:13:15] on Amen brother Derek and then probably
[1:13:18] worry about running out of food and
[1:13:19] their own little shop here in
[1:13:22] menant right they they try to plan they
[1:13:24] try to to do amen but this one had
[1:13:26] nothing to do with planning the discip
[1:13:29] disciples hadn't done no
[1:13:33] planning and Jesus said you got any food
[1:13:35] they said well no we ain't got nothing
[1:13:36] got any money no we ain't got nothing
[1:13:38] what he got I got a couple I found a
[1:13:40] little lab with five fishes and two
[1:13:41] loaves of bread bring it to me and he
[1:13:44] begins to bless it and it begins to
[1:13:46] break it off and break it off until they
[1:13:49] fed 5,000 then they had 12 baskets left
[1:13:52] over now that doesn't compute with a
[1:13:54] human
[1:13:56] bra you can't believe it with this human
[1:13:59] abilities you got to believe it by
[1:14:02] faith and the same God that provided for
[1:14:05] 5,000 is the same God that can provide
[1:14:08] for you
[1:14:09] tonight amen if he would break off Fish
[1:14:12] and Loaves amen for 5,000 people that he
[1:14:15] was ministering to don't you know that
[1:14:17] he knows your need tonight he knows your
[1:14:19] struggle he knows what you're going
[1:14:21] through he knows your financial
[1:14:23] situation and he still Jehovah
[1:14:26] Gyra he still can provide when there's
[1:14:29] nothing in the bank account and there's
[1:14:30] nothing around to go he can still come
[1:14:33] on the S and put something there when
[1:14:35] there's nothing
[1:14:36] there he's that kind of God but except a
[1:14:40] man be born again he cannot understand
[1:14:42] the kingdom of God there's no way of
[1:14:45] understanding it until you are born
[1:14:50] again then God reveals himself to you
[1:14:52] then you know that you pass from death
[1:14:54] and life because no man can call Jesus
[1:14:56] the Christ only by the Holy Spirit the
[1:14:58] only way you'll ever know that Jesus is
[1:15:00] the Christ is when the Holy Spirit
[1:15:02] personally witness to you that he is the
[1:15:04] resurrected Lord Jesus no matter what he
[1:15:07] would do what kind of signs what kind of
[1:15:08] Miracles you'll never know it until your
[1:15:11] personal experience with
[1:15:13] God you say well I I believe it's
[1:15:16] because the Bible said so that's good
[1:15:18] the Bible's true I know it is well the
[1:15:20] preacher said so perhaps he knows it
[1:15:23] mother said so she knows it maybe but
[1:15:25] what about you do you know
[1:15:28] it do you know it you'll never know it
[1:15:32] until it's revealed to you individually
[1:15:34] by the Holy Spirit then by acception you
[1:15:38] become new creatures in Christ Jesus
[1:15:40] born the second time you can't live
[1:15:42] twice you have to die once in order to
[1:15:44] be born again and when you die to
[1:15:46] yourself you're born again of the Holy
[1:15:49] Spirit there's no reasoning of the word
[1:15:51] of God you take it for what it says it
[1:15:54] settle God said so it's
[1:15:59] finished but it's our little weakness in
[1:16:01] our own human
[1:16:03] intellect what we call human what we
[1:16:06] call intellectual
[1:16:07] Faith so we read a little something and
[1:16:10] say well yeah that's right I I believe
[1:16:12] that's right you're you're you're
[1:16:13] preaching that's right that's
[1:16:16] intellectual but brother something's got
[1:16:18] to happen down in the depths to make you
[1:16:21] really believe it cuz intellectual faith
[1:16:25] will
[1:16:28] reason I mean Eve believed God was real
[1:16:32] she believed that he said what he said
[1:16:34] was going to come to
[1:16:36] pass but it had to go beyond
[1:16:38] intellectual
[1:16:40] Faith well you say well my my case is so
[1:16:43] hard there's no need
[1:16:45] of even if even trying my case is too
[1:16:48] hard that's your
[1:16:50] reasoning is there anything too hard for
[1:16:53] the Lord what's too hard for God he said
[1:16:57] one time ago I got saved about 23 years
[1:16:59] ago I made up my mind right like this I
[1:17:02] wasn't going to worry about anything God
[1:17:03] said because God is able to keep his own
[1:17:06] word any job that's too big for God to
[1:17:09] do what's the use of me worrying about
[1:17:13] it amen if he's almighty God he does all
[1:17:16] things if he can't do all things he's
[1:17:18] not almighty God therefore I believe in
[1:17:21] to be almighty God so I commit myself to
[1:17:23] him my soul my body my living my
[1:17:25] breathing my D my resurrection and some
[1:17:28] glorious day he will come back for
[1:17:32] me but while he's coming his church is
[1:17:35] in the make it I want to stand in the
[1:17:37] breach with my arms out and claim his
[1:17:39] resurrection power that he's the same
[1:17:41] yesterday today and forever and his
[1:17:43] powers never ceased and never will fail
[1:17:45] he's the same all the way around I love
[1:17:48] him and I want you to love him I want
[1:17:49] you to believe him perfect love cast out
[1:17:51] all fear if you love him with the right
[1:17:53] kind of heart you you won't have one
[1:17:55] Speck of fear whether he'll keep his
[1:17:57] word or not
[1:17:59] that's night after night standing on the
[1:18:02] platform before gross thousands of
[1:18:04] people around the world critics is this
[1:18:06] that or the other which doctors this
[1:18:08] that and the other challenge you never
[1:18:10] one time I say by the grace of God has
[1:18:12] one Speck of fear ever hit my heart not
[1:18:15] one time he said he would come he would
[1:18:18] take care of me and I believe what he
[1:18:23] said any more Believers in the building
[1:18:26] tonight but I tell you when the Lord
[1:18:28] Jesus anoints you you're not made out of
[1:18:30] running
[1:18:32] material not the rock of they said this
[1:18:35] ain't the rock of jabal broter I'm
[1:18:36] talking about it's the Rock of Ages you
[1:18:39] can climb up on that God's word and take
[1:18:42] your position there and stand there
[1:18:44] while the gates of hell are battling
[1:18:46] against you with this perfect assurance
[1:18:50] that he who promised it will not fail
[1:18:53] and cannot fail
[1:18:57] that's Faith that's when you're not
[1:18:59] scared the devil you know he's nothing
[1:19:01] but a bluff snorting and blowing Thunder
[1:19:03] and carrying on but I tell you the
[1:19:06] lightning power of the resurrected Jesus
[1:19:08] Christ puts a reality there that'll
[1:19:09] shock the soul from the dead Slumber of
[1:19:12] these Earthly bound things into the
[1:19:13] immortal Realms to believe God and take
[1:19:15] him at his word and call those things
[1:19:17] which are not as though they
[1:19:20] are oh God I pray let the lightning
[1:19:23] power the resurrection to Jesus Christ
[1:19:25] strike this building tonight not just
[1:19:28] this building but strike these temples
[1:19:30] sitting here Amen to believe for the
[1:19:33] impossible to believe for healings to
[1:19:36] believe for deliverances Amen to believe
[1:19:38] for our loved ones to come home it
[1:19:40] doesn't matter how bad it looks it
[1:19:43] matters what his word said and I he said
[1:19:46] it I believe
[1:19:53] it he said the reason we have such times
[1:19:56] as we have listen to this this is
[1:20:00] powerful the reason we have such hard
[1:20:03] times or such times as we are have is
[1:20:06] because there's too much halfway
[1:20:11] conversions intellectual
[1:20:15] conversions there's two different
[1:20:17] elements in the human body that has a
[1:20:19] has a mind one of them is reason is of
[1:20:21] the mind which is intellectual the other
[1:20:23] one is the soul which does not reason
[1:20:25] but believes the word of God you know
[1:20:27] sometime they said the science laughed
[1:20:29] at the Bible and said the Bible says a
[1:20:31] man think it's in heart so is he the
[1:20:33] Bible's all mixed up because the man has
[1:20:35] no mental faculties in the heart but
[1:20:37] last year they proved that God was right
[1:20:39] they found right down the heart of a man
[1:20:41] not in an animal a man a little
[1:20:42] compartment there where even a blood
[1:20:44] cell doesn't exist they say it's the
[1:20:46] occupant of the Soul amen while where
[1:20:48] the Man soul lives each one of you has
[1:20:51] had an experience to think you know to
[1:20:53] to think like that that he said when
[1:20:55] somebody says it can't happen it won't
[1:20:56] be but something down on your soul is
[1:20:59] telling you it's going to
[1:21:01] be it's going to be the world is saying
[1:21:05] the devil's saying there's not going to
[1:21:06] be a Rapture but there's somebody here
[1:21:08] on the face of the Earth saying it's
[1:21:09] going to
[1:21:10] be it's going to be it's going to happen
[1:21:14] it don't make no difference what anybody
[1:21:15] else says how unreasonable it seems you
[1:21:17] seem to know it's going to be that way
[1:21:20] is because your soul has testified and
[1:21:22] reason is have been cast out is the bble
[1:21:24] said they should he said I want each
[1:21:26] Christian here tonight no matter what
[1:21:28] church you belong to that doesn't matter
[1:21:30] has nothing to do with it this time amen
[1:21:32] for the Bible plainly says by one Spirit
[1:21:35] we're baptized into the body it's
[1:21:36] whether you're right with God or not is
[1:21:38] the main principle and the mind will
[1:21:40] reason things it'll look here and say
[1:21:43] well this is unreasonable it'll sit here
[1:21:45] and look at this woman in the wheelchair
[1:21:46] and say well she's paralyzed she can't
[1:21:48] walk and she'll sit there it'll look
[1:21:51] over here at this one has got bone
[1:21:52] problems and maybe a spine broke and say
[1:21:55] well there ain't no way there's no help
[1:21:56] for that one all kinds of reasons that
[1:21:59] come back but as long as you dwell in
[1:22:02] mental reasonings you will never see no
[1:22:07] difference but the Bible says we got to
[1:22:09] cast them
[1:22:11] down it doesn't matter what it looks
[1:22:14] like it matters what his word
[1:22:17] says by his stripes it's time we really
[1:22:21] got to believe in that
[1:22:25] come on somebody to believe it with our
[1:22:27] whole heart it doesn't matter what it
[1:22:29] looks like doesn't matter how bad it
[1:22:31] looks doesn't matter what the signs say
[1:22:33] as so far as physically amen the body
[1:22:36] may say one thing it only matters what
[1:22:38] his word says by his stripes I'm
[1:22:43] Healed it's finished it's done it's over
[1:22:46] with he's already paid the
[1:22:49] price come let us reason
[1:22:52] together by his stri
[1:22:55] I am healed what the devil has stole
[1:22:58] from some of you he stole some of your
[1:23:01] health and he's come and stole things in
[1:23:04] your body and and moved in ways and
[1:23:07] deformities and caused issues and he
[1:23:10] cause all kind of infirmities amen but
[1:23:12] let us reason together let us bring some
[1:23:15] true reasoning what's true reasoning
[1:23:17] let's bring the word of God into this
[1:23:20] the word of God says the Lord God is the
[1:23:22] Healer of all our diseases and the word
[1:23:25] of God Says by his stripes I am
[1:23:31] healed so we cast down every
[1:23:38] reasoning he talks about a
[1:23:41] woman as we bring this
[1:23:44] down how she was reasoning with the word
[1:23:47] she's reasoning with things and she kept
[1:23:50] bringing up excuses why she wouldn't
[1:23:51] surrender to God tells about this woman
[1:23:54] woman her soul would tell her that's
[1:23:56] wrong but she'd push that
[1:23:59] aside and she'd lift up her
[1:24:01] reasons well I ain't going to go to
[1:24:03] church because I got this problem or you
[1:24:06] know the biggest reason the devil keeps
[1:24:08] some people out of the church is because
[1:24:09] he said well you can't go until you get
[1:24:12] right what kind of reason is that you go
[1:24:16] so you can get
[1:24:19] right well you go then people going to
[1:24:22] look at you funny so
[1:24:25] what does it
[1:24:26] matter it only matters what how he looks
[1:24:29] at
[1:24:30] me but he brings all kind of reasonings
[1:24:33] up well if you go they're going to say
[1:24:35] this they're going to do that they're
[1:24:36] going to make fun of they going they're
[1:24:38] going to sneer and snot they're going
[1:24:41] to and you get there many times and they
[1:24:44] they're the first ones that throw their
[1:24:45] arms around you and welcome you
[1:24:49] back but the devil had kept you out for
[1:24:52] months and months and months he why
[1:24:55] because of
[1:24:57] reasonings trying to bring this up and
[1:25:00] this up over here and cause this doubt
[1:25:02] over here and then she said he said she
[1:25:03] kept pushing that
[1:25:05] down her soul would want to get right
[1:25:08] and she'd push it down her soul would
[1:25:10] want to get right and would try to come
[1:25:12] and speak the word of God he should push
[1:25:14] it
[1:25:19] down and he talks about it she kept
[1:25:21] grieving that soul and finally
[1:25:24] it begin to separate from her and go
[1:25:27] away and after a while she got to a
[1:25:29] place that a young fellow moved in the
[1:25:31] neighborhood married man and she began
[1:25:33] to have a lot of Friendship with this
[1:25:34] nice slick fell he picked her up talking
[1:25:36] to her PE taking her places and finally
[1:25:39] end up kissing her good night and not
[1:25:40] the back of fence and after a while she
[1:25:41] left her husband he left his wife and
[1:25:43] they married which is contrary to the
[1:25:45] word of God see that Soul disbelieving
[1:25:47] it finally moved away from God and got
[1:25:50] away from God she was going by reasoning
[1:25:54] now listen to this she was still playing
[1:25:56] the piano in
[1:25:59] church I'm not talking about somebody
[1:26:01] you'd think is a r cner playing the pen
[1:26:04] on Church a good member just as good as
[1:26:07] anybody she moved into another
[1:26:09] neighborhood with this man and continued
[1:26:10] on into church brought her letter to
[1:26:12] another church first thing you know the
[1:26:14] woman finally well that man woman going
[1:26:17] if he said he took us she he took up
[1:26:19] with another woman and she takes off
[1:26:21] again runs around finally wound up with
[1:26:23] a common law husband it finally caught
[1:26:25] up with her and she began to get some an
[1:26:26] and aches and pains in her lower regions
[1:26:29] she went to the doctor and had a
[1:26:30] malignancy there and the doctor said
[1:26:32] prepare for death it's
[1:26:34] coming and a certain Minister which was
[1:26:37] a friend of mine went to her to talk
[1:26:38] about her soul to her why she'd give him
[1:26:41] to understand smoking one cigarette
[1:26:42] after another I never sent for you and
[1:26:44] I'm just as good as you are so reasoning
[1:26:47] had talked her into
[1:26:49] this I'm just as good as you are he said
[1:26:52] that's the very attitude proen what she
[1:26:54] was she said I belong to church I was
[1:26:56] raised in church he said listen I belong
[1:26:59] to the same church I know that our
[1:27:00] church doesn't teach that you got to be
[1:27:02] born
[1:27:05] again she said you get to the door if
[1:27:07] IID wanted you I'd have sent for you all
[1:27:10] right I've done what I can and he
[1:27:16] leaves and talking the minister come
[1:27:19] talk to brother Brandon he said well
[1:27:20] watch her when she goes to die at the
[1:27:23] end of the road
[1:27:25] because she just committed that sin and
[1:27:26] went to reasonings instead of listening
[1:27:29] to her
[1:27:31] soul but that soul will catch up with
[1:27:35] her
[1:27:36] someday when she come time to die Pastor
[1:27:40] was with her people in the room just as
[1:27:42] normal thought she was all right
[1:27:43] believing she was all right when she
[1:27:46] come to die when those mental
[1:27:49] faculties that operated by Blood and
[1:27:52] nerves which was in the brain that will
[1:27:55] perish at your
[1:27:57] death hello that will perish at your
[1:28:00] death your mental faculties your
[1:28:02] reasoning will pass away because
[1:28:04] reasonings cannot come in the presence
[1:28:07] of
[1:28:08] God it reason with God it's but it's the
[1:28:12] soul that lives and the blood cease to
[1:28:14] go through her brain cells and the nerve
[1:28:16] seases cease and her memories are her
[1:28:18] reason begin to Cast Away then what
[1:28:20] happened the soul that she had grieved
[1:28:23] had been dead to her all those years
[1:28:25] begin to come to her and she be to
[1:28:27] scream my God I'm
[1:28:30] lost the Pastor said oh come on here
[1:28:33] dear here I'm lost the doctor ran says
[1:28:36] she's getting hisory cicle give her a
[1:28:38] shot I'm lost I'm
[1:28:41] lost it
[1:28:43] sealed her lips to their other Mortal
[1:28:46] ills that shot to put her out but the
[1:28:48] soul that
[1:28:49] realized and had been grieved away it'll
[1:28:52] haunt her as long as is there's an
[1:28:56] eternity so remember don't go by
[1:29:02] reasonings go by faith that's the way
[1:29:04] you do it that's accepting the Lord
[1:29:07] Jesus Christ amen and being born again
[1:29:09] of the spirit of God when your entire
[1:29:12] soul testifies the word of God is right
[1:29:15] and you stay with it and you believe
[1:29:17] every word because their spirit bear
[1:29:19] record with his
[1:29:21] spirit is it what he said in Proverbs 3
[1:29:23] and vers vers five trust in the Lord
[1:29:25] with all thine heart and lean not unto
[1:29:28] thine own
[1:29:32] understanding see we cannot lean to what
[1:29:35] we understand or what we can see with
[1:29:36] these natural eyes because God sees
[1:29:39] things a whole lot different in what we
[1:29:41] see listen it's amazing I've watched
[1:29:44] Christians face
[1:29:47] death even death you can't even give an
[1:29:51] good excuse for and just wonder why how
[1:29:55] why why why why would this
[1:29:57] happen but because they're not listening
[1:29:59] to
[1:30:01] reasonings they're not leaning on their
[1:30:03] own understanding but they're trusting
[1:30:06] God in all their
[1:30:08] ways they can continue to take another
[1:30:10] step it ain't easy they take another
[1:30:13] step they get up and go another day they
[1:30:16] move another mile why because it ain't
[1:30:18] on their
[1:30:19] reasoning it ain't on how they can
[1:30:21] figure it out because see God sees
[1:30:23] things a whole lot different than what
[1:30:25] we
[1:30:28] see God allows things to happen in our
[1:30:31] lives because he sees way ahead down our
[1:30:34] roads we may not can see amen just even
[1:30:37] the next mile marker but God can see all
[1:30:40] the way down to our Eternal he said I
[1:30:42] know the thoughts that I think about you
[1:30:45] they are of good and not of evil cuz I
[1:30:47] want to bring you to an expected
[1:30:50] end he already has seen the end he
[1:30:53] already has seen the journey he already
[1:30:55] has seen every part of it so God can see
[1:30:58] things when we don't so how can we
[1:31:01] reason God and reason against his will
[1:31:03] and say how could this happen how could
[1:31:05] this be no we have to say God I trust
[1:31:08] you I don't know why I don't know how I
[1:31:10] don't know where how this is going to
[1:31:12] turn out but I trust God and God's
[1:31:15] brought me this far and the one who
[1:31:16] brought me here who started the work
[1:31:18] he's not going to drop me off and
[1:31:20] forsake me but he's going to finish what
[1:31:22] he started
[1:31:25] oh bride of Jesus Christ we ought to
[1:31:27] take great confidence in our God he
[1:31:29] didn't come down to the seventh Church
[1:31:31] age to give up and to lay it aside and
[1:31:34] throw down his throw down his tools as
[1:31:36] it were as a man that was chiseling out
[1:31:38] a piece of stone and gives up on it no
[1:31:40] this God ain't going to give up but he's
[1:31:42] going to keep hammering at it and
[1:31:44] hammering at it and hammering at it amen
[1:31:47] why cuz he is had in his mind a
[1:31:49] masterpiece of
[1:31:51] Christ and it will come to pass as in
[1:31:56] his mind I don't know how I don't know
[1:32:00] how it's G to be people ask me all the
[1:32:03] time now how how you think this is going
[1:32:04] to work out Trump's in here and this I
[1:32:06] said don't
[1:32:07] matter it's just going to work how God's
[1:32:11] planted there ain't nobody that's come
[1:32:13] up into power and kingdoms arose that
[1:32:15] God didn't have it in his
[1:32:17] orchestration God's been in control
[1:32:20] moving ponds and pieces to bring us to
[1:32:23] an exp expected end what is our expected
[1:32:26] end a body
[1:32:28] change a meeting in the air in the Sweet
[1:32:31] By and By we cannot lean to our own
[1:32:35] understandings we cannot allow our
[1:32:37] thoughts to come higher than his word
[1:32:40] but tonight let's exalt the word of God
[1:32:43] higher than I God your thoughts are
[1:32:46] higher than my thoughts your ways are
[1:32:49] higher than my ways your ways are past
[1:32:52] finding out
[1:32:54] man has draw made himself go crazy
[1:32:56] trying to figure out God you'll never
[1:32:58] figure out God but God wants to
[1:33:02] come and move in our hearts and lives
[1:33:04] and lead
[1:33:06] us as Lambs that are just willing to
[1:33:09] walk along with him knowing he's got it
[1:33:13] oh

[1:33:35] enough for
[1:33:37] me is it good enough for you

[1:33:43] bring it to
[1:33:44] pass in your life I mean I wonder how

[1:34:18] how this is going to be or how that's
[1:34:20] going to
