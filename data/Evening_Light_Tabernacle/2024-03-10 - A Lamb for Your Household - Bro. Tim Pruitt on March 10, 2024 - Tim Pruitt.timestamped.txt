[55:06] ask big things of God Amen because he's
[55:09] capable of doing great things amen we
[55:13] just look at our lives and see what we
[55:16] are because of him and real realize what
[55:19] we would be without
[55:21] Jesus and uh you know I said the other
[55:25] day about you know I I don't know what I
[55:28] would do if I wasn't a
[55:30] Christian my grandson Drew you know he's
[55:33] he's got a young mind he looks over his
[55:35] mom and dad said he'd probably be
[55:38] [Laughter]
[55:43] smoking well you
[55:46] know but what would we be without
[55:49] Jesus amen what would we be without him
[55:53] that's probably the worst thing he could
[55:55] think of
[55:57] but you know you can smoke in a lot of
[56:00] different ways you can have a temper
[56:02] that's so bad that is
[56:05] uncontrollable you know there's you can
[56:07] have a personalities that's lit on the
[56:09] fires of hell but oh I'm so thankful for
[56:13] Jesus when he comes down in our lives
[56:16] and changes us amen Exodus chap chapter
[56:20] 12: 211 then Moses called for all the
[56:24] Elders of Israel and said unto them
[56:27] draw out and take you a lamb according
[56:29] to your families and kill the Passover
[56:32] and you shall take a bunch of his and
[56:35] dip it in the blood that is in the Basin
[56:38] and strike the lentil and the two- side
[56:40] post with the blood that is in the Basin
[56:44] and none of you shall go out of the door
[56:46] of his house until the morning for the
[56:50] Lord will pass through to Smite the
[56:53] Egyptians and when he seeth the blood
[56:55] upon the lentil and on the twoos side
[56:58] post the the Lord will pass over the
[57:02] door and will not suffer the Destroyer
[57:06] to come into your houses to Smite you
[57:09] amen God bless you can be seated I want
[57:12] to speak today on a lamb for your
[57:16] household as you you know I I recently
[57:21] come through the message of the token
[57:24] which brother brandham said was a high
[57:26] light of his entire Ministry outside of
[57:28] the Seven Seals and and that Commission
[57:31] of God that that all the other sermons
[57:34] had kind of pointed to that and I I
[57:37] think it's very very vital and
[57:40] important and today we want to speak
[57:42] about a lamb for your household and and
[57:46] um and you know to to keep the death
[57:50] angel from your home is very of vital
[57:54] importance and
[57:56] and of course that is by applying the
[57:59] Holy Ghost to your house and I I don't
[58:03] think who you no matter who you are this
[58:05] morning that you're exempt from the
[58:09] death angel come knocking on your door
[58:11] and the enemy come in to try to destroy
[58:15] and to to wreck and to
[58:18] ruin but um you know we we we want to
[58:22] have the blood applied no matter where
[58:25] we are what what our situation is and
[58:28] brother bradam told us in the message of
[58:30] the token he said believe what believe
[58:32] on the Lord Jesus Christ for your house
[58:36] and apply the token to your house now
[58:40] you know and of course this was easy to
[58:43] see in the Old Testament that the lamb
[58:47] would be killed and there was a physical
[58:49] house to which you applied physical or
[58:53] literal blood but here in in this uh
[58:57] instance we we see that the token is now
[59:02] the life of the blood which is the Holy
[59:04] Ghost and that life must be applied to
[59:08] every household it's very very
[59:11] important and brother brandom told us
[59:14] about applying the token well of ver
[59:17] first thing you know you've got to get
[59:19] rid of the Le in your
[59:21] home as they would in the Jewish Customs
[59:25] they when they would approach the
[59:27] Passover they would search the whole
[59:29] house for leevan anything leevan had to
[59:33] be thrown out and they would even go to
[59:36] the extreme of lighting a candle or or
[59:39] shining a light under under everything
[59:42] removing anything that would be of
[59:45] Leaven because it would be a
[59:48] representative of sin so brother Brandon
[59:51] said when you apply to your house what
[59:53] you do you move all the trash out out
[59:57] you get the short skirts and the shorts
[59:59] and the cards and the cigarettes and the
[1:00:01] televisions and what more and kick them
[1:00:04] out the door and when you go to apply
[1:00:07] the token he said you you won't stand
[1:00:09] still for it you take it all out the the
[1:00:12] dances the parties the rock and roll the
[1:00:14] old vulgar newspapers the stuff of the
[1:00:16] world you kick it out the door and say
[1:00:18] we're cleaning the place up so of course
[1:00:21] this is uh one of the very first steps
[1:00:24] of of getting ready for the lamb you
[1:00:27] know you you want you want your house to
[1:00:30] be a place where Angels come where the
[1:00:33] spirit of God gathers amen where it um
[1:00:37] where it comes with the Holy Angels
[1:00:40] there and and their presence and I
[1:00:43] present because as brother bandam said
[1:00:45] you make your house a place where that
[1:00:48] he's always
[1:00:50] welcome and of course when you look into
[1:00:52] your home and you see things that are
[1:00:55] out of order
[1:00:56] it's time to bring order to the disorder
[1:00:59] in your home saying we're cleaning this
[1:01:01] place up and of course we have to bring
[1:01:04] this thing to a modern day a modern time
[1:01:07] that we're living in it it's it's very
[1:01:10] important that we we also realize the
[1:01:13] the things of our modern times that we
[1:01:16] are caught up in that takes away our
[1:01:20] time from really spiritual things and
[1:01:23] not only that but from family time and
[1:01:26] family
[1:01:27] relationships you know where that we we
[1:01:30] get caught up in in um the things uh
[1:01:33] that could be useful tools but you can't
[1:01:36] let it control your life you know we
[1:01:39] hear of things I I'm not familiar with
[1:01:41] all of them but with Facebook and Tik
[1:01:44] Tok and Instagram and and and different
[1:01:46] things and many of this can be useful
[1:01:50] tools but it cannot and it should not
[1:01:53] control the life it should not control
[1:01:57] the
[1:01:58] conversation you know it's so many times
[1:02:01] even with family gatherings families
[1:02:02] can't be families anymore and and this
[1:02:05] was a complaint that brother brandham
[1:02:07] saw you know where there there is a
[1:02:09] breakdown of the family because Satan is
[1:02:12] after your family to destroy family life
[1:02:16] and it's hard to keep unity in this day
[1:02:19] and hour that we're living in and hard
[1:02:21] to keep a a Christ centered uh family
[1:02:25] and family life and family structure and
[1:02:28] and it's hard to do when everybody's on
[1:02:30] their cell phone and you can't have a
[1:02:33] conversation it's hard to do when when
[1:02:36] everybody's in their own little world
[1:02:38] out here in an imagination living in an
[1:02:41] imaginary world that don't really even
[1:02:45] exist you know it's hard to do when it's
[1:02:47] when uh when we have young men young
[1:02:51] women that are caught up in gaming and
[1:02:53] different things that that is taken up
[1:02:56] all their time and and and all their
[1:02:58] energies and that's what their mind and
[1:03:00] their focus is upon when in this hour
[1:03:04] our Focus ought to be on Christ now you
[1:03:07] know you know I'm I'm going to throw out
[1:03:09] a lot of things here today and and when
[1:03:12] you put medicine out you know just take
[1:03:14] what's on the shelf for you and and um
[1:03:17] you know leave the rest of it up there
[1:03:18] for somebody else but don't do no
[1:03:20] pitching amen just just take it if you
[1:03:23] can use it use it but you some of these
[1:03:26] things that we we go through today I
[1:03:29] mean you find it it stirs up Strife it
[1:03:32] stirs up jealousies it stirs up Envy it
[1:03:36] start starts up arguments and debat amen
[1:03:40] the things that that that burden your
[1:03:42] life
[1:03:43] down that keep you from having that
[1:03:46] family structure that is that is Christ
[1:03:50] centered and brother Brenham is talking
[1:03:52] about this he said kick those things out
[1:03:55] get get rid of the things or at least
[1:03:58] limit those things that that are
[1:04:00] becoming destructions in your life and
[1:04:04] getting you off of what's really
[1:04:07] important amen you know as I said you
[1:04:11] know I I I've dealt and I sometimes deal
[1:04:14] with people around the world and when
[1:04:16] you hear of people getting fantasy
[1:04:19] relationships even on the internet and
[1:04:22] you know back and forth and
[1:04:24] communicating back and forth for you got
[1:04:26] to be very careful and keep your guard
[1:04:28] up because Satan will get in there and
[1:04:32] and you'll have a romantic um
[1:04:34] relationship in your mind whether it
[1:04:36] ever turns physical and you you're
[1:04:39] married people you that's adultery you
[1:04:41] know that amen it's adultery and so you
[1:04:45] you got to realize these things can be
[1:04:49] the gateway to good information or to
[1:04:52] bad information or to good relationships
[1:04:55] start a bad relationship and you must
[1:04:58] apply the token the Holy Ghost even to
[1:05:02] practical manage now so it must be to
[1:05:06] your your your household and you must
[1:05:10] know the Death Angel is coming he's here
[1:05:13] in the land and don't let him steal your
[1:05:16] joy don't let him steal your peace you
[1:05:20] know don't don't let him allow you to
[1:05:23] get over by looking over into somebody
[1:05:25] else's um life and their business and
[1:05:28] what they're doing and and you know who
[1:05:30] they had for company and what they had
[1:05:32] for supper or what they have in their
[1:05:34] home or these kind of things to cause
[1:05:36] you unrest and and
[1:05:39] discontentment to spark jealousies
[1:05:42] because you wouldn't included when you
[1:05:45] could be the bigger person and include
[1:05:47] somebody else I'm going to talk about
[1:05:49] some of these things this morning
[1:05:51] because you want to apply it to your
[1:05:54] household you you see brother Brandon
[1:05:56] said get ready apply it believe it clean
[1:05:59] up let your children let your family let
[1:06:02] your loved ones see it in you that's
[1:06:06] right and it'll take effect so you want
[1:06:09] to see it in your you want everybody
[1:06:12] else to see it in you you are influence
[1:06:15] influencing someone
[1:06:18] else even if you're a young person a
[1:06:20] young boy you're influencing other boys
[1:06:23] use your influence right if you're a
[1:06:26] young lady you know use your influence
[1:06:28] in godliness if you're a young adult or
[1:06:31] you're a young married couple you know
[1:06:34] others are looking to see how you are
[1:06:37] living and what you are doing and
[1:06:39] they're going to emulate it and worse
[1:06:41] than that your kids are going to be
[1:06:43] watching what you
[1:06:45] do and your attitude toward Christ is
[1:06:48] going to have a real effect on their
[1:06:51] lives and that attitude is showing you
[1:06:54] know even in Church attendance or or
[1:06:57] your or how you relate to others and how
[1:07:00] you handle things in your home and that
[1:07:03] is going to have a great influence it'll
[1:07:06] have more influence than all the Sunday
[1:07:08] school and the twice a week times of
[1:07:10] coming to church your daily life has an
[1:07:14] influence upon your family and you want
[1:07:17] them under the token now these are some
[1:07:21] very very practical pastoral things but
[1:07:24] I I want to speak about it this morning
[1:07:27] because the atmosphere of your home is
[1:07:29] very important brother Aaron spoke and
[1:07:32] did masterful job on on atmospheres and
[1:07:36] so on like that and I happen to be
[1:07:38] studying at the same you know at the
[1:07:40] same time with with this so I'm some of
[1:07:43] this may be reiterating or
[1:07:46] reinforcing but you know I I want as if
[1:07:49] the Holy Spirit was dealing with me and
[1:07:51] dealing with him at the same time I
[1:07:53] think it's very important that we bring
[1:07:55] some of these things out but you know
[1:07:58] the thing about it in our lives you know
[1:08:00] we all have things that we look at Even
[1:08:04] in our own homes or maybe the way we was
[1:08:06] raised or brought up but it's time that
[1:08:09] you break the
[1:08:11] Cycles it's time that you realize hey
[1:08:14] there are things that I really need to
[1:08:17] quit blaming on how I was rais and how I
[1:08:20] was done and my my past let the past be
[1:08:24] the past
[1:08:26] and you know and and allow God to give
[1:08:29] you a real
[1:08:31] future a lot of you need to leave your
[1:08:34] past behind well this preacher done me
[1:08:38] this this wrong or that one did me this
[1:08:41] way or this person didn't act right or
[1:08:44] or my parents were this kind of people
[1:08:47] or what if it's wrong just break the
[1:08:50] cycle you know don't let it continue to
[1:08:53] govern and Rule your life
[1:08:57] amen realize these are these things stop
[1:09:01] here there's there were things even my
[1:09:03] life that I had good good parents and
[1:09:06] and I was raised by Christian people and
[1:09:09] yet there were still things that I had
[1:09:11] to break the cycle and I said that stops
[1:09:14] right here I'm not carrying this down
[1:09:17] another
[1:09:18] generation you know I I would hear
[1:09:21] always here because my my folks in the
[1:09:24] past
[1:09:26] were Pentecostal and Pentecost split
[1:09:28] into two and and you know the Trinity
[1:09:31] and the Oneness and and then the
[1:09:32] Holiness and the non Holiness and and
[1:09:35] some of the family went this way and
[1:09:37] that way and you know they they all
[1:09:38] claimed to have the same baptism of the
[1:09:41] Holy Ghost and the Pentecostal
[1:09:43] experience but they were all you know
[1:09:45] separated and they they allowed that to
[1:09:48] destroy
[1:09:50] relationships they allowed that to
[1:09:52] destroy love in the family and then I
[1:09:56] find that it moves right on into the
[1:09:57] message where you can't even have
[1:10:00] siblings that can worship together and
[1:10:03] you know one's is this way and one's
[1:10:05] that way and it and it follows right on
[1:10:07] down but with me I decided with my
[1:10:10] family we're breaking the cycle we're
[1:10:12] not taking this on another generation I
[1:10:16] don't have to see this repeat because
[1:10:19] I'm stopping that right here amen and
[1:10:23] and that's what you have to do you have
[1:10:25] to break the cycles of your complexes of
[1:10:28] your failures of the failures of the
[1:10:31] past you see them for what they are you
[1:10:33] call them what they are and then you
[1:10:36] apply the
[1:10:37] token amen it's very very important and
[1:10:40] and so brother brandham would would
[1:10:43] would be asked some very simple
[1:10:45] questions for example he said brother
[1:10:47] brandham what activities should our our
[1:10:50] children participate in and how should
[1:10:52] we go about selecting their assoc sh you
[1:10:55] know that's very
[1:10:58] important you say well I have no right
[1:11:01] oh God I I can't stand these modern
[1:11:03] parents well I have no right to their
[1:11:05] room no you that's your home and the
[1:11:09] tokens got to be
[1:11:11] applied amen it should not be that you
[1:11:13] walk in and the room's all black and all
[1:11:17] all all with hip hop and all the other
[1:11:19] nonsense whatever it is no that ought
[1:11:21] not this is God's house the token is
[1:11:25] applied here we want the Holy Spirit
[1:11:28] welcome we'll have the right kind of
[1:11:31] music we'll have the right kind of of
[1:11:33] attitudes we're not going to reflect
[1:11:35] things of the world we're not going to
[1:11:37] have Pinups and things you know that
[1:11:39] that represents Hollywood and all of
[1:11:41] that we're Christians
[1:11:43] here amen so you know that's part of it
[1:11:47] so brother bam said what was asked what
[1:11:49] kind of activities and how should we go
[1:11:52] about helping them select their
[1:11:54] Associates
[1:11:55] now you know I I hate to hate to say
[1:11:58] this and I hate to even go here but you
[1:12:01] know sometimes you even have to watch it
[1:12:03] even with church
[1:12:05] people you got to protect your
[1:12:08] family even even you you are young
[1:12:11] Christians the first thing you got to do
[1:12:13] is cut off the wrong
[1:12:16] relationship people that are going to
[1:12:18] pull you
[1:12:21] down amen because you are known by your
[1:12:24] friend friends you're known by your
[1:12:27] Associates and so you know when you come
[1:12:29] to Christ you're no longer associated
[1:12:32] with that kind of life let them know I'm
[1:12:34] a Christian I don't do those things I I
[1:12:38] don't want to be a part of that anymore
[1:12:40] I'm not going on your
[1:12:43] grounds amen now so you see and brother
[1:12:47] brandom answered you know what keep them
[1:12:50] in Christian company as long as you
[1:12:53] possibly can
[1:12:55] and if it's a girl keep her with
[1:12:57] Christian girls Christian boys vice
[1:12:59] versa if she's old enough to go with the
[1:13:02] boy see that she keeps with the right
[1:13:04] kind of
[1:13:05] boy discourage her to any boy otherwise
[1:13:09] or girl to boy boy to a girl if she's
[1:13:13] going with an unbeliever try to
[1:13:15] encourage her to go with a Believer and
[1:13:17] vice
[1:13:18] versa you know there's a lot of
[1:13:21] questions comes up about about mixed
[1:13:24] race and mixed marriages and all this
[1:13:26] let me tell you the worst mixed marriage
[1:13:30] that is sin and that is for a Believer
[1:13:33] to marry an
[1:13:35] unbeliever don't even go near them don't
[1:13:38] even date them don't have nothing to do
[1:13:40] with them so well I'm going to witness
[1:13:42] to them be very very careful there
[1:13:45] because he will change or she will
[1:13:47] change for
[1:13:49] you instead of a real
[1:13:53] reason amen and the real reason for
[1:13:56] coming to it should be to come to Christ
[1:13:58] to get in love with him not to do this
[1:14:01] to please a girl or a
[1:14:03] boy now so you see you you make your
[1:14:09] home
[1:14:12] nice this is what brother brandom tells
[1:14:15] us make your home nice make your your
[1:14:19] home a place where your daughter or son
[1:14:23] will not be ashamed to bring their
[1:14:25] company before their father and mother
[1:14:27] and into their home and make the home so
[1:14:32] happy that they will be pleased in their
[1:14:35] home to stay
[1:14:37] there Hallelujah you say that ain't
[1:14:40] possible brother damn not in my
[1:14:42] situation listen I can do all things
[1:14:44] through Christ that strengthens
[1:14:46] me we are not talking about you being
[1:14:50] able to do it we're talking about
[1:14:51] applying the holy
[1:14:53] ghost that you get so in love with Jesus
[1:14:57] that the atmosphere of your home becomes
[1:15:00] Jesus and his peace and his love are you
[1:15:04] with me and and so you make your home so
[1:15:07] happy that they'll be pleased in their
[1:15:10] home to stay there you you see your
[1:15:14] children are going to emulate and copy
[1:15:17] what you
[1:15:18] do the way that you handle things the
[1:15:22] way you know they're going to they're
[1:15:24] going to express their temper this same
[1:15:26] way they saw you express it amen they're
[1:15:29] going to hold grudges just like they saw
[1:15:32] you hold
[1:15:33] grudges they're going to on the other
[1:15:35] hand show love and
[1:15:39] forgiveness
[1:15:41] amen you see again if you learn to love
[1:15:46] and be kind to everybody and I'm quoting
[1:15:48] and to be gentle and have patience it'll
[1:15:51] even make your home life different it'll
[1:15:54] make your Association different God will
[1:15:57] honor you well I tell you what I'm a man
[1:16:01] I can't say I love you you're not a man
[1:16:04] that's
[1:16:05] right you hadn't learned to be a
[1:16:09] man let's let's come on let's change it
[1:16:12] to Jesus right now can he tell us he
[1:16:14] loves us can he express love to his
[1:16:18] children can he tell his sons I love
[1:16:21] you amen now if you get Jesus on the
[1:16:24] inside you'll be able to do it
[1:16:27] too that's right amen so you see you
[1:16:30] learn to love and be kind to everybody
[1:16:33] and to be
[1:16:35] gentle now you see you must be a Godly
[1:16:39] example
[1:16:41] Christianity must be lived at
[1:16:44] home it's not just for
[1:16:47] church it's not just to put on an air in
[1:16:49] front of your business associates and
[1:16:51] I'm a Christian praise God you know and
[1:16:54] you're saying Jesus Jesus all the time
[1:16:56] that's not it real Christianity is
[1:17:00] something
[1:17:01] lived it's must be lived at home if it
[1:17:05] doesn't live at home it doesn't

[1:17:14] to start with devotion with praying

[1:22:30] action in
[1:22:33] you now so you see so again you you you
[1:22:37] you apply it with confidence he said you
[1:22:40] create an atmosphere that'll just drop
[1:22:43] right in or you if you got the token you
[1:22:46] create a spirit around you a power that
[1:22:49] when you walk people know you're a
[1:22:51] Christian they love for you to say
[1:22:54] something to them they believe your word
[1:22:57] they hold on to it you see he taught us
[1:23:01] that we're miniature creators now buddy
[1:23:04] we all want to create
[1:23:09] squirrels I know better than that you
[1:23:11] get you Hunters here don't want a
[1:23:13] squirrel you want that trophy
[1:23:15] Buck I'll speak him right there I want
[1:23:19] that trophy fish I want to on my third
[1:23:22] try I'll get him third
[1:23:31] pull you know you want to be able to
[1:23:33] control the weather what I'm trying to
[1:23:35] tell you is about controlling the storms
[1:23:38] in your
[1:23:39] [Applause]
[1:23:40] life what good if there's Sunshine out
[1:23:43] there if there ain't a the sunlight so
[1:23:46] light in your
[1:23:49] home amen so now you see every man
[1:23:53] that's born again with the spirit of God
[1:23:55] in him is a miniature
[1:23:57] Creator now we are just not in the
[1:23:59] Millennium yet I don't know if you
[1:24:01] figured that out yet but we're not there
[1:24:05] so right now you know it's not the
[1:24:08] Millennium so we have all kinds of
[1:24:10] things that are happening in this world
[1:24:13] that we're living in and and and it's
[1:24:16] not a perfect
[1:24:18] world but you can control circumstances
[1:24:23] around you
[1:24:24] your faith can do
[1:24:28] it now he said we're in the image of God
[1:24:32] God is a Creator and that's the reason
[1:24:35] you can believe God could could heal a
[1:24:37] person because God is in you and God
[1:24:39] made the world and he just spoke it and
[1:24:41] his word become material the very ground
[1:24:45] that you're sitting on is the word of
[1:24:46] God made manifest if he didn't where did
[1:24:49] he did he get it he just spoke it and it
[1:24:52] turned in existence he believed his own
[1:24:54] word and if a man is born of the spirit
[1:24:57] of God he's an offspring of God and that
[1:25:01] part of God is in him and he believes
[1:25:03] every word that God says will
[1:25:06] materialize and so that makes him a part
[1:25:08] of God the holy spirit in the man makes
[1:25:11] him a part of God so you believe that
[1:25:14] every word of God will materialize so
[1:25:16] I'm going to have my family I'm going to
[1:25:19] have my children there's going to be his
[1:25:21] peace in my home there's going to be joy
[1:25:23] and comp contentment here why because if
[1:25:27] it's not there I can create
[1:25:32] it I'll believe the word and it'll
[1:25:36] materialize I'm going to confess his
[1:25:38] promise and it's going to happen so he
[1:25:41] said you you know you seen nice people
[1:25:43] but you just can't hardly stand to be
[1:25:45] around them well I I hope that isn't
[1:25:49] me seemingly nice
[1:25:53] but
[1:25:55] can't stand but uh you know I can take
[1:25:57] there's just some people you can take
[1:25:59] just about that much
[1:26:02] of you know you can tell there's
[1:26:05] something wrong in their
[1:26:08] Spirit you know I I I've met I've met
[1:26:11] people that I've and preachers even that
[1:26:13] I've had to keep at arms length you know
[1:26:15] I I you know there's just something
[1:26:17] there and you try you try to to break
[1:26:20] through it you try to you know go around
[1:26:23] it you try whatever but it's all always
[1:26:24] there you know there's something wrong
[1:26:26] in the spirit and and sooner or later it
[1:26:28] manifest but then but then you see and
[1:26:31] he said some people that maybe he a
[1:26:33] little scrawny f a little old woman bent
[1:26:35] over a washtub but you just love to be
[1:26:37] around them you know it it is there
[1:26:40] stature their looks or their physique
[1:26:42] you know it's it's the the atmosphere
[1:26:45] around them the way they live that
[1:26:48] create an atmosphere that you just like
[1:26:51] to be around that they're just lovely to
[1:26:54] people to be with isn't that what you'd
[1:26:56] want to be just somebody that everybody
[1:27:01] just they just love to get get with you
[1:27:04] because they know there there's
[1:27:06] something of godliness and Faith that's
[1:27:09] going to come out of your life you're
[1:27:11] you're emulating
[1:27:13] Christ now he said so he said you know
[1:27:16] you you can he said some you can see
[1:27:19] they're just they're nice or whatever
[1:27:21] but you don't like to be around them you
[1:27:23] know and and
[1:27:24] the reason is is because anybody can be
[1:27:27] nice on the
[1:27:31] surface but we're talking about
[1:27:35] depth we're not talking about something
[1:27:38] artificial either we're talking about
[1:27:39] being
[1:27:41] real and the way you become real is by a
[1:27:43] new birth you're birthed into this kind
[1:27:46] of life and you have the Holy Ghost and
[1:27:48] that Holy Ghost In You allows the spirit
[1:27:52] of God arve to create an atmosphere
[1:27:55] about you he said you've seen people
[1:27:58] that you love to be around is that
[1:28:00] creative power that's upon the people
[1:28:02] they create an atmosphere around where
[1:28:05] they're at if they're full of love not
[1:28:08] make believe but real love you can feel
[1:28:10] it you know when you know they're
[1:28:12] Christians when you shake their hands
[1:28:14] say I'm I'm your friend John you can
[1:28:16] feel it you you might not agree with me
[1:28:19] but I I believe in heartfelt
[1:28:21] religion and I I think that's what we
[1:28:23] ought to have his heartfelt religion
[1:28:25] like the brother
[1:28:27] brandham quoted a a black brother saying
[1:28:30] you know that that the boss said to him
[1:28:32] said there's no such thing as heartfelt
[1:28:35] religion he said well one thing you like
[1:28:38] boss and saying there's no such thing is
[1:28:40] a heartfelt religion as far as you
[1:28:44] know amen as far as you know because he
[1:28:48] knew different you see and I believe in
[1:28:51] a heartfelt religion I believe you can
[1:28:54] feel it that God gives you something
[1:28:57] inside of you that changes you it makes
[1:29:00] the atmosphere around you different he
[1:29:03] said I've tried it I know it's the truth
[1:29:05] that man can create in himself the
[1:29:07] atmosphere that he lives in and around
[1:29:09] him he's anointed in the with the spirit
[1:29:13] and I've seen people you just can't
[1:29:14] couldn't get away from them you just
[1:29:17] love them that there's something drawn
[1:29:19] about them it's it's because they live
[1:29:22] in that atmosphere they live under the
[1:29:24] power of the Holy
[1:29:27] Spirit you see they they can change the
[1:29:32] situation by the power of
[1:29:36] creation because it can be done in a
[1:29:40] home it can be done in a church it can
[1:29:44] be done in a nation it can be done in
[1:29:48] the whole world is atmosphere that
[1:29:51] counts you see the atmosphere of the
[1:29:54] holy ghost moving through you it's a
[1:29:57] life it's a living Force it's not just a
[1:30:01] paint that's on your life that's
[1:30:03] external is it's a life that lives on
[1:30:05] the inside of you that flows
[1:30:08] automatically out of
[1:30:10] you amen this is what we're talking
[1:30:12] about token life it's a his life just
[1:30:16] living out freely through you not
[1:30:19] something you work up or pump up or have
[1:30:22] to get you know a a a another um another
[1:30:26] Revival to get it up it's something that
[1:30:28] lives out of you and flows out of you
[1:30:32] now you know just a very thing about
[1:30:36] atmosphere you can take an egg and of
[1:30:39] course it's the atmosphere of the ham
[1:30:43] with the moisture from her body the heat
[1:30:46] there that keeps it at a certain
[1:30:48] temperature produces an atmosphere where
[1:30:51] that there can be growth in that and
[1:30:54] that with a little chick in That egg you
[1:30:57] can do the same thing and artificially
[1:30:59] do it in an incubator but you see it's
[1:31:01] the atmosphere that counts and in a
[1:31:05] church in a home and even your life it's
[1:31:10] the atmosphere that
[1:31:12] counts you see you make up that
[1:31:16] atmosphere with what you are on the
[1:31:19] inside of you so you get the inside
[1:31:22] right first
[1:31:25] do you see there can be there can be an
[1:31:28] atmosphere for healing there can be an
[1:31:31] atmosphere for the Holy Ghost there can
[1:31:34] be an atmosphere for the love of God
[1:31:36] there can be atmosphere for peace and of
[1:31:39] joy and I want to say again it starts at
[1:31:46] home you know what a cancer is a cancer
[1:31:50] brother Brandon we talk about is it is a
[1:31:52] back sliden cell that's right gets in
[1:31:55] your body and it starts working
[1:31:57] erratically and it begins to grow and
[1:31:59] build another life that's on the
[1:32:02] inside when you got to realize that you
[1:32:05] this this church is made up with
[1:32:08] cells your family is made up with cells
[1:32:12] each one mom dad children all are cells
[1:32:15] of that family then those families are
[1:32:17] cells of a church one gets sick the
[1:32:20] whole body's
[1:32:21] sick that's why brother br will tell you
[1:32:24] that the misbehavior of one Christian
[1:32:26] can make the church bitterly
[1:32:29] fail amen now you know and and to make
[1:32:33] you understand that we're going to go on
[1:32:36] we're going to make
[1:32:38] it amen but you can cause others to
[1:32:41] bitterly fail or situations there where
[1:32:45] the atmosphere isn't right where there
[1:32:48] there's not healing where there there is
[1:32:50] not Deliverance where there's not uh Sal
[1:32:54] salvation because of atmosphere so it's
[1:32:57] very important that you when you come
[1:33:00] together create that right kind of
[1:33:02] atmosphere so the Holy Ghost can do its
[1:33:06] work amen but it starts at
[1:33:10] home it starts at home brother Bram said
[1:33:13] in the Seal of the Antichrist and this
[1:33:15] struck struck me sometime ago about our
[1:33:19] lives and he said you ought to go home
[1:33:22] everybody get down around the tonight or
[1:33:25] else bring mother and kitties and all
[1:33:27] them together around the bed and say
[1:33:28] mother let's pray right here till God
[1:33:30] makes things different around
[1:33:34] here well you said well they want to
[1:33:36] pray with me well start with
[1:33:41] yourself just get
[1:33:43] you whether you're husband or wife
[1:33:45] doesn't matter if you you're a child in
[1:33:47] the
[1:33:49] home hey I I'm telling you the truth
[1:33:53] amen I can point to a girl that was 10
[1:33:56] years old and her mother and dad was not
[1:33:58] Christians and she got filled with the
[1:34:00] Holy
[1:34:02] Ghost and what did she you know with
[1:34:04] that with that within her life she began
[1:34:07] to pray for her
[1:34:11] parents and what happened they got
[1:34:14] saved you see that's what a 10-year-old
[1:34:17] can do with the Holy
[1:34:19] Ghost and you can do that too in your
[1:34:21] home for your family for your children
[1:34:23] but you have to
[1:34:26] believe you have to put your faith to
[1:34:29] work faith is not a plaque on your
[1:34:32] wall faith is something that must work
[1:34:36] be put to work faith without works is
[1:34:39] dead it's useless brother brandham said
[1:34:42] pastors you ought to call your
[1:34:43] congregations together on Sunday morning
[1:34:45] now and say let's start a new you will
[1:34:48] be kind to one another oh brother Tim
[1:34:51] that's uh that's ain't Seven Seals that
[1:34:55] ain't seven
[1:34:57] Thunders well Paul would write in the
[1:34:59] scripture and be ye kind one to another
[1:35:03] somebody needed
[1:35:05] that and that's in the words of the
[1:35:07] Apostle Paul I think it's applicable
[1:35:09] today be ye kind one to another
[1:35:13] Pentecostal preachers he said sometimes
[1:35:15] that men will go downtown you'll see
[1:35:17] them on the street sometimes we just
[1:35:19] jump into traffic and consider your
[1:35:22] friends
[1:35:24] I mean come on what what what are you
[1:35:27] doing what are you doing getting so
[1:35:29] Under Pressure that you're exhibiting
[1:35:32] road
[1:35:35] rage what are you doing I mean really is
[1:35:38] it that important let the other go
[1:35:44] first well you know you're you're
[1:35:46] hearing them today fighting and killing
[1:35:48] each other over over being cut off in
[1:35:52] traffic
[1:35:54] you have to be careful anymore you
[1:35:56] you're going to make somebody give you a
[1:35:58] cussing
[1:36:00] out because of just a wrong ter wrong
[1:36:03] thing or whatever but what about your
[1:36:07] attitude you see brother Brandon said if
[1:36:09] you see someone fixing to get a ticket
[1:36:13] I'm just showing you some principles I
[1:36:15] don't care who he is he said put a
[1:36:18] nickel in the meter now that nickel
[1:36:20] probably won't do much good anymore but
[1:36:22] anyway don't let him be fined he said
[1:36:25] even in everything it will grow on
[1:36:29] you you know you start making a practice
[1:36:32] of of of doing
[1:36:35] right you know and and and applying the
[1:36:38] Holy Ghost it'll grow on you try to be
[1:36:41] good to another try to shake hands and
[1:36:43] be friendly and
[1:36:46] nice you know I really don't have to say
[1:36:49] too much about that to you here in the
[1:36:51] South we're generally that way we wave
[1:36:54] as we pass people we
[1:36:56] speak you know but brother Brandon would
[1:36:58] talk about his own wife you know and and
[1:37:00] say to her said you know honey uh uh you
[1:37:04] didn't speak to that woman he he said I
[1:37:08] smiled he said a silly little
[1:37:12] grin he said that ain't the way to do it
[1:37:14] he said you take somebody by the hand
[1:37:17] give him a good shake and say how do you
[1:37:19] do God bless
[1:37:22] you you know
[1:37:24] again but I I don't really have to say
[1:37:26] that much about that here because you're
[1:37:28] that kind of people you're some of the
[1:37:30] warmest friendliest wonderful people on
[1:37:33] the Earth because God lives in you and I
[1:37:36] appreciate that for you I I love it that
[1:37:39] you don't let a stranger come here and
[1:37:41] feel like a stranger I love it that
[1:37:43] you're accepting and and that you're
[1:37:45] you're reaching out and that you're not
[1:37:47] judgmental of others but you try to be
[1:37:50] shake shake hands and be friendly and
[1:37:52] you you tear Down the Walls of petition
[1:37:55] of malice and difference and and
[1:37:58] ungodliness and you just keep doing good
[1:38:00] to one another and I I appreciate those
[1:38:02] virtues in your
[1:38:04] life you know that's the kind of people
[1:38:07] that are God's
[1:38:09] people every time you meet one another
[1:38:11] you brother Bram even said you make
[1:38:14] yourself be
[1:38:16] good sometime it just ain't
[1:38:19] natural so you have to have the Holy
[1:38:22] Spirit Well up with in you and make you
[1:38:24] do
[1:38:25] it come on Amen that old evil spirit
[1:38:29] made you drink and smoke and lie and
[1:38:31] cuss and hang with the wrong crowd it
[1:38:34] made you do it well why not the Holy
[1:38:36] Spirit In You amen flowing in your life
[1:38:39] making
[1:38:42] you Amen to the first thing you know
[1:38:44] that it'll just grows around you till a
[1:38:48] big bundle of love will just wrap you
[1:38:51] up and brother Brandon said said that's
[1:38:54] the marking of
[1:38:57] God now so you see it's a it's a sign of
[1:39:01] the Holy Spirit you know the sign isn't
[1:39:04] speaking in tongues or jumping or
[1:39:06] shouting or neither is it just say well
[1:39:08] I believe the message making confession
[1:39:10] of Faith but no it's a life that is
[1:39:13] lived out of here you know that's what
[1:39:15] you want to see is the
[1:39:18] life now in the Bible there are
[1:39:22] qualifications
[1:39:24] for pastors
[1:39:27] deacons and a lot of people think they
[1:39:30] got to be that
[1:39:32] way these
[1:39:34] are deacons must be pastors must be you
[1:39:38] know what you know what Paul was doing
[1:39:41] he says choose your leaders from these
[1:39:44] kind of
[1:39:47] people this is what a Christian should
[1:39:51] be amen
[1:39:53] yes lovers of their
[1:39:56] wives
[1:39:59] Christians true on the inside and out
[1:40:02] when they're in church and out where the
[1:40:05] community around gives a good
[1:40:09] report amen you you know again pastors
[1:40:12] and deacons you that's maybe their
[1:40:15] qualification but they're just chosen
[1:40:17] from those who are example Christians
[1:40:20] and one of one of the things that I want
[1:40:21] to speak about is lovers of
[1:40:26] hospitality the Bible said don't neglect
[1:40:29] to show hospitalities as strangers for
[1:40:32] thereby some have entertained angels
[1:40:38] unawares the example given is Abraham
[1:40:41] what if he' had left let those strangers
[1:40:44] pass his dwelling that day but he went
[1:40:47] and invited them in said Don't Pass Me
[1:40:51] By you you know the you see again this
[1:40:56] has given you the invitation to step
[1:40:59] outside of your comfort zone to offer
[1:41:03] provision or Comfort or safety and love
[1:41:06] to strangers and to those that are in
[1:41:08] need you said well you know I don't have
[1:41:11] the best house I I don't have the you
[1:41:14] know my house ain't ain't like everybody
[1:41:16] else's listen you know when I had a a
[1:41:19] little frame House of 24 by 32 and and
[1:41:23] this Center blocks to climb up on to get
[1:41:25] in it and I hung curtains for
[1:41:28] bedrooms I entertained Ministers of this
[1:41:32] message and gave them of what I
[1:41:38] had I had the liks of per Green in there
[1:41:42] trying to help help my wife sort you
[1:41:45] know through uh through the refrigerator
[1:41:47] and and stacking things in it to get get
[1:41:50] everything back
[1:41:52] in and he slept behind a curtain that
[1:41:56] was over the door cuz I didn't have it I
[1:41:58] didn't have the money to put doors
[1:42:02] up we had we we did with what we
[1:42:07] had come on you see you know often often
[1:42:12] you know we we got to step outside our
[1:42:16] our comfort zone and offer provision
[1:42:20] Comfort safety love you know inviting
[1:42:23] others into our home and and and giv a a
[1:42:27] place for them to feel the love of Jesus
[1:42:30] in our lives that's what it's all about
[1:42:34] Christian Life is living for others it's
[1:42:37] not about you it's about him it's about
[1:42:40] his people it's about making them feel
[1:42:43] welcome you offer the Bible said in
[1:42:45] First Peter 4 and a it said offer
[1:42:49] Hospitality to one another without
[1:42:52] grumbling oh God help us you know
[1:42:57] share again in Romans 12 he said share
[1:43:00] with the Lord's people who are in need
[1:43:02] and practice
[1:43:05] Hospitality well we don't have much it
[1:43:07] ain't what you
[1:43:09] have if you have some love that's what
[1:43:12] needs amen I I I've sat down I've sat
[1:43:16] down and just had Beans and
[1:43:18] Cornbread you know it isn't what was
[1:43:21] offered it was the love and it was a
[1:43:25] Hospitality you know but but I'm just
[1:43:27] not that way brother Tim it's just not
[1:43:29] my nature yeah I know it's out of your
[1:43:31] comfort zone but you got to break out of
[1:43:35] it even have friends it's easy enough to
[1:43:38] complain about not having
[1:43:42] friends well I don't have any friends
[1:43:44] and I tell you what everybody at that
[1:43:46] church is stuck up well you're lying
[1:43:47] right
[1:43:49] there cuz starting with me I'm not stuck
[1:43:52] up
[1:43:53] starting with from there to all the way
[1:43:55] to the back pew we're not a bunch of
[1:43:57] stuck up stuff up people you know but
[1:44:00] let me just say you know it's easy to
[1:44:04] complain about not having
[1:44:07] friends the Bible said in Proverbs a man
[1:44:10] that hath friends must show himself
[1:44:14] friendly that's so if you want friends
[1:44:17] you got to be
[1:44:18] friendly you got to make friends with
[1:44:21] others well no body ever invites me well
[1:44:25] start inviting
[1:44:27] others you you don't have to be the
[1:44:29] always the one
[1:44:32] entertained amen try entertaining
[1:44:36] others think about them their needs
[1:44:39] their situation you know it's like
[1:44:41] Martha she opened her home to to the
[1:44:45] Lord they they were called the friends
[1:44:46] of Jesus right she had a sister called
[1:44:50] Mary who she sat at the Lord's feet and
[1:44:53] she was listening to what he said but
[1:44:56] Martha was distracted about all the
[1:44:59] preparations she had to
[1:45:01] make you know this has got to be in
[1:45:03] order and this has got to be done and
[1:45:06] this has got to be done and and my and
[1:45:09] she comes in complaining
[1:45:12] Lord don't you care my sister has left
[1:45:16] me to do all this work by myself you
[1:45:20] know tell her to get up and help me and
[1:45:23] Jesus said Martha you're worried and
[1:45:26] upset about many
[1:45:28] things but few things are needed really
[1:45:31] only one and Mary has chosen what is
[1:45:34] better and it'll not be taken away from
[1:45:36] her you see Martha had opened her home
[1:45:40] to Jesus but her heart was distracted
[1:45:44] and worried about preparations of her
[1:45:46] home rather than focusing on the
[1:45:49] person in their
[1:45:51] home Mary Miss Mary
[1:45:56] understood that Jesus was the most
[1:45:58] important
[1:46:00] thing and of course we ought to be good
[1:46:03] stewards of our home but the most
[1:46:06] important thing in our home should be
[1:46:09] Jesus honoring him loving him serving
[1:46:12] him showing him to others loving those
[1:46:15] that he's brought into our lives and you
[1:46:17] know and if you just let go of them the
[1:46:23] the
[1:46:24] need of of for Perfection and approval
[1:46:28] you can you can be there to help with
[1:46:30] God's people that's right but you got to
[1:46:32] let go of that first it it isn't about
[1:46:35] impressing it's about serving it's about
[1:46:38] loving it's about
[1:46:39] giving it's about Entertaining Angels
[1:46:44] people that are going to be in
[1:46:47] eternity amen you see
[1:46:50] again again you know
[1:46:53] a lot of people don't find it's easy to
[1:46:55] open the door and to to be hospital but
[1:46:59] but there again you're going to have to
[1:47:00] let the Holy Spirit do a work in your
[1:47:02] own
[1:47:03] life and and become like the New
[1:47:06] Testament Church and the New Testament
[1:47:08] Church the Bible said after they were
[1:47:10] received the Holy Ghost they continued
[1:47:12] daily with one Accord in the temple and
[1:47:15] breaking bread from house to house and
[1:47:17] ate their food with gladness and
[1:47:19] simplicity of heart you see there was a
[1:47:22] camaraderie there was a Unity there was
[1:47:25] a
[1:47:26] fellowship
[1:47:28] now and of course a lot of us have
[1:47:32] complexes that won't allow us to do
[1:47:36] things and and you you say well what can
[1:47:39] I do about my complex well I'll tell you
[1:47:42] take the
[1:47:44] opposite amen if you're always wanted
[1:47:47] your own way you know you've been the
[1:47:49] little brat all your life that always
[1:47:51] always wanted everything your way way
[1:47:53] well turn right back and give away
[1:47:55] everything you got you know do the
[1:47:58] opposite of what you're doing you know
[1:48:00] if you want to hold on to everything
[1:48:02] Give It Away amen Jesus told the the
[1:48:05] Rich Young Ruler he said one thing you
[1:48:08] lack you you see he was willing though
[1:48:11] for that one thing to keep him from
[1:48:14] eternal
[1:48:16] life and he
[1:48:18] said just go Vice the versa so when you
[1:48:22] know know you got this family trait when
[1:48:25] you know things are this way you start
[1:48:27] doing things
[1:48:32] opposite amen that's the way to overcome
[1:48:35] is give it the
[1:48:39] antidote brother brandom said his old
[1:48:41] mother would say the hair from the dog
[1:48:43] is good for the bite well I don't know
[1:48:45] about that now I wouldn't go to that
[1:48:48] Kentucky way but I'll tell you this much
[1:48:50] you know the antidote is do opposite yes
[1:48:53] yeah if you know you're going One
[1:48:55] Direction just quit turn around do
[1:48:59] different you find it hard to to to to
[1:49:01] tell your spouse I love you then make
[1:49:04] your make
[1:49:13] yourself
[1:49:15] yeah make yourself I don't know how you
[1:49:18] got married
[1:49:21] honestly
[1:49:23] you had trouble saying I love you when
[1:49:25] you were courting and going together hey
[1:49:27] girl boy that's a wrong signal right
[1:49:30] there when you're when you're engaged or
[1:49:33] approaching engagement and somebody
[1:49:34] can't say express
[1:49:40] feelings and I'm not talking
[1:49:44] about
[1:49:47] manhandling Keep Your Hands to
[1:49:51] Yourself your lips
[1:49:54] too your hugs
[1:49:57] too be
[1:50:01] Christians so brother Bram talked about
[1:50:04] this we know there was one perfect man
[1:50:09] so all of us can use
[1:50:15] Improvement cuz there's only one perfect
[1:50:18] man and he made the example for
[1:50:21] us see Jesus never lived for himself he
[1:50:25] lived for
[1:50:27] others and brother BR talks about that
[1:50:30] he said that is perfectly eternal life
[1:50:33] when you say you go to church and you do
[1:50:35] good things that's fine but when you
[1:50:37] live your life to yourself you have an
[1:50:39] eternal life eternal life is living for
[1:50:43] others it proved it when it come in the
[1:50:46] Lamb of God he lived and had eternal
[1:50:48] life because he did not live for himself
[1:50:50] he lived for others and you re receive
[1:50:53] eternal life by receiving that day on
[1:50:56] Calvary and you don't live for yourself
[1:50:59] anymore so it isn't about you no
[1:51:03] more it's about Jesus it's about serving
[1:51:07] him that's why brother brandom would say
[1:51:10] that's why people
[1:51:11] can someone said how can you stand and
[1:51:14] let anybody call you bad names cuz you
[1:51:18] don't live for yourself that's you live
[1:51:20] for others that you might redeem that
[1:51:22] man you become sons and the trouble of
[1:51:25] it is the church has forgot they were
[1:51:27] Sons you sons and you're taking Christ's
[1:51:30] place you are Sons so you don't live for
[1:51:32] yourself you live for others so so some
[1:51:34] somebody called you a bad name so what
[1:51:36] do you do you exercise
[1:51:40] forgiveness I heard somebody say the
[1:51:42] other day a preacher said he preached a
[1:51:44] sermon and I I heard about this sermon
[1:51:47] that he preached he thought it was a
[1:51:48] great sermon and he and he says you know
[1:51:51] I if if you if you will not forgive a
[1:51:56] person then whatever you bind on Earth
[1:51:58] is bound on heaven so God won't forgive
[1:52:01] that person either till you forgive them
[1:52:03] I said that's
[1:52:04] baloney you got it
[1:52:08] wrong the truth of it is you can't be
[1:52:11] forgiven unless you let
[1:52:15] go of all your feelings of all your
[1:52:18] thoughts all everything just let it
[1:52:21] go amen and give it to God surrender to
[1:52:25] him that's what you got to do with it
[1:52:27] you can't continue living under that
[1:52:30] shadow it binds you it hinders you just
[1:52:34] let it go forgive
[1:52:37] it well they owe me an apology well
[1:52:39] forgive them their debt that's what
[1:52:41] Jesus said forgive my debts as I forgive
[1:52:45] others so you see I'm going to have
[1:52:47] trouble getting
[1:52:49] forgiveness if I don't forgive
[1:52:55] you want to be forgiven sure you
[1:52:58] do well
[1:53:01] forgive for whatever judgment you meet
[1:53:04] out that's with where you'll be
[1:53:07] judged you
[1:53:09] see Church isn't
[1:53:12] going brother Brandon said Church isn't
[1:53:14] going to church just to play music sing
[1:53:17] songs church is a place for correction
[1:53:19] judgment must begin at the house of God
[1:53:21] we must reckon ourselves dead and alive
[1:53:24] to Christ and then he made the way that
[1:53:26] we can sacrifice ourselves to his
[1:53:28] service to follow him if we follow him
[1:53:31] we lead the life that he led that's
[1:53:34] wonderful Jesus spoke of it and and and
[1:53:37] he and he goes on and tells he said but
[1:53:40] now it's not put on I just told you you
[1:53:43] know if you're if you're not that way
[1:53:45] naturally would do the opposite and I
[1:53:48] just told you you don't make yourself be
[1:53:51] good because I tell tell you you might
[1:53:53] not be that way naturally but with the
[1:53:56] Holy Spirit on in you you are that way
[1:54:00] supernaturally let the supernatural
[1:54:05] show amen we my goodness we've seen
[1:54:08] enough of
[1:54:10] Flesh let's see the Holy Spirit emulate
[1:54:13] itself from our lives so you know he
[1:54:16] would say there at the judine he would
[1:54:18] say to the Sheep stand on on my right
[1:54:22] side goats on my left side and he would
[1:54:24] say to them depart from me you workers
[1:54:26] of iniquity I was hungry you didn't feed
[1:54:28] me I was in prison you didn't visit me I
[1:54:31] was naked you clothed me not I was
[1:54:32] thirsty you gave me no drink I was sick
[1:54:35] and you didn't visit me so depart from
[1:54:38] me and he said now but notice this and
[1:54:42] don't fail to get this keep this in your
[1:54:44] heart
[1:54:45] forever that to the
[1:54:47] others it was unconsciously done they
[1:54:50] said Lord when when did we do
[1:54:53] this when did we feed you when did we
[1:54:57] when did we clothe you when when did we
[1:55:00] help you what and he said well what have
[1:55:02] you did to the least of my little ones
[1:55:05] you did it to me but he said notice it
[1:55:07] was unconsciously done it wasn't because
[1:55:11] it's my
[1:55:14] duty amen people don't do it for a line
[1:55:17] of duty a man that gives you something
[1:55:19] cuz he ought to man that feeds you CU he
[1:55:22] up to he's got a selfish idea it ain't
[1:55:25] about working your way to heaven it's
[1:55:27] about letting Christ live out of
[1:55:30] you so you know they were so surprised
[1:55:33] those sheep was and when they when they
[1:55:36] were said Lord when did we see you
[1:55:37] thirsty and we gave you drink when were
[1:55:39] you sick and we ministered to you he it
[1:55:42] was so automatically done it was just a
[1:55:46] life lived in
[1:55:49] them and that's what we want to see
[1:55:51] where where where Calvary really done
[1:55:54] something for us to place the Life of
[1:55:58] Christ in us and it's an unselfish life
[1:56:02] you don't even have the second thought
[1:56:04] no you don't have to think about it
[1:56:06] you're just dead the world so alive in
[1:56:08] Christ walking up the highway and these
[1:56:10] things are just an automatic thing they
[1:56:12] just automatically live out of you
[1:56:14] that's where you want to see
[1:56:16] it amen not a forc religion not trying
[1:56:19] to work your way to heaven but until the
[1:56:22] sweetness of the Holy Ghost comes down
[1:56:25] within your soul and it just flows out
[1:56:28] like Rivers of Life Giving refreshing
[1:56:33] Waters amen so you become a stream that
[1:56:36] everyone can come and drink from those
[1:56:39] that are weary and sick or needy that
[1:56:42] they can come to you and find virtue
[1:56:45] find strength you see it's not something
[1:56:48] you try to do or work yourself into it
[1:56:51] just something born in into you that's
[1:56:53] the token the token isn't a bunch of
[1:56:56] Works religious works and we're going to
[1:56:59] try to do better and try to do good no
[1:57:02] just get in love with Jesus and then let
[1:57:05] that love just flow out of you and it
[1:57:08] can come out unhindered until it just
[1:57:11] permeates the atmosphere around you and
[1:57:14] everybody just loves to be around you
[1:57:17] now you see um you see as as brother
[1:57:22] random said you know you know I believe
[1:57:24] in shouting but that's just emotions I
[1:57:27] believe in clapping our hands I believe
[1:57:29] in those things we ought have done that
[1:57:32] but you left off the great things undone
[1:57:34] it's that self-sacrifice life that God
[1:57:37] lives in you automatically doing that
[1:57:40] which is right because it's right and
[1:57:43] then going on don't even think nothing
[1:57:45] about it just living it and that's what
[1:57:48] I'm talking about just living it till
[1:57:50] Christ just lives out of your life life
[1:57:52] just flows out to others it's not
[1:57:55] artificial it's not put on it's it's not
[1:57:58] like a buzzard you know trying to put
[1:58:00] Dove feathers in him and say look I'm a
[1:58:02] dove you you know everybody can see your
[1:58:05] false I'm not talking about false
[1:58:07] humility and I'm not talking about false
[1:58:09] love I'm talking about genuine love of
[1:58:13] God emulating from your life in your
[1:58:17] home in your marriage to your husband to
[1:58:20] your wife to your children to your
[1:58:25] parents everybody in love with Jesus say
[1:58:28] it ain't possible yes it
[1:58:30] is we're in the day the token must be
[1:58:33] applied to the
[1:58:35] house a lamb for the
[1:58:39] household you know brother badam took a
[1:58:42] sermon he would often quote it it's not
[1:58:44] on tape when he called rever Mr Lily so
[1:58:49] the Lily is born you know down in the m
[1:58:52] in the mud and pushes it way up to the
[1:58:55] top and then puts out this beautiful
[1:58:57] Bloom that's that's who you
[1:59:00] are you were born in the muck and the
[1:59:03] mud of sin

[1:59:17] around you you know that that there's a
[1:59:20] Radiance a perfect fume you know you
[1:59:23] know that that even though you come up
[1:59:26] in the Quagmire even though you you came
[1:59:28] up in the world even though you came up
[1:59:30] in a bad home life but you pressed above
[1:59:34] that and here you are on the top and
[1:59:36] you're showing to everybody Christ
[1:59:39] lives and you're showing his Beauty and
[1:59:42] his Radiance and and there's there's a
[1:59:44] sweet smell about you and it it takes a
[1:59:47] an old dirty stinky Pond and makes a
[1:59:51] place of beauty Beauty there I see
[1:59:53] beauty in the midst of
[1:59:56] sbls and that's what God did for you he
[1:59:59] he took it took you out of the shambles
[2:00:02] took you out of the dirt and he made you
[2:00:05] a thing of beauty a thing that showed
[2:00:08] Christ that he lives that that even in
[2:00:12] this dark dismal dirty filthy World That
[2:00:17] Jesus Lives how do we know he's living
[2:00:20] he's I'm sh
[2:00:22] his resurrected life I pressed through
[2:00:25] the things that held me down the things
[2:00:28] people said about me the the things of
[2:00:31] my past what my husband did what my
[2:00:34] daddy my mother did all of these other
[2:00:36] hurts I I pressed through them

[2:00:47] parents I was adopted let me tell you
[2:00:50] every one of us were adopted

[2:01:29] let the come the past be the past you
[2:01:33] got a new
[2:01:39] future every one of you is a Creator yes
[2:01:42] that's right did you know that every
[2:01:45] each person that's born again is a
[2:01:47] Creator we must create an
[2:01:50] atmosphere brother Brown talked about
[2:01:53] his own
[2:01:55] home and it was there was
[2:01:58] a an
[2:02:01] atmosphere there with his wife with his
[2:02:05] family it was due to people who were
[2:02:08] sick come to his home for
[2:02:11] prayer sick people laying on his porch
[2:02:15] wanting a vision or a word from
[2:02:17] God and you can imagine how it was if
[2:02:20] you were sick doctors had given you up
[2:02:23] or your child was sick or crippled or
[2:02:27] whatever else and you knew the prayer of
[2:02:29] this man of God would produce the
[2:02:30] miracle
[2:02:31] needed You' do whatever you could amen
[2:02:34] you'd lay on the
[2:02:35] porch you you you would you would Badger
[2:02:39] you would do anything you would try to
[2:02:40] get to that man of God because I want to
[2:02:42] be
[2:02:44] delivered right but you know what it
[2:02:47] made for brother brandham that normal
[2:02:49] family time wasn't possible
[2:02:52] it was hard to cook for his wife to cook
[2:02:56] and take care of little kids with a
[2:02:58] house full of
[2:02:59] people you know his wife would get
[2:03:02] nervous because of the atmosphere and
[2:03:05] this one you know this one upset about
[2:03:07] this and this and you know just thr
[2:03:09] about that and this and you know W in a
[2:03:11] word from the Lord here and even
[2:03:14] sometimes worse some people coming with
[2:03:16] a so-called word for the from the Lord
[2:03:19] for brother brandom to do their bidding
[2:03:23] but you know and a day after getting
[2:03:25] everyone ministered to and prayed for
[2:03:27] and sent away he would then have to get
[2:03:30] the atmosphere of his home changed due
[2:03:34] to his wife being frustrated because of
[2:03:37] so many people there there's children
[2:03:39] hungry and crying and fussing but I want
[2:03:42] you to notice he knew he could create an
[2:03:48] atmosphere and rather than scolding her
[2:03:51] for not being a willing part of his
[2:03:54] ministry and dech christianizing her
[2:03:57] because she wasn't grateful that there
[2:04:00] were healings and
[2:04:01] miracles he instead began to silently
[2:04:06] pray as he worked about changing the
[2:04:12] atmosphere now most of us I don't know
[2:04:15] of any of you that have that kind of
[2:04:17] situation in your home where you know
[2:04:20] hundreds of sick people are laying on
[2:04:22] your porch and wanting prayer and this
[2:04:24] and that and the other you maybe your
[2:04:26] cause isn't that Noble but let me tell
[2:04:28] you tensions
[2:04:30] come let me tell you problems rise and
[2:04:35] the atmosphere gets wrong and you can
[2:04:38] change it in fact it's your
[2:04:41] responsibility to change it by the holy
[2:04:45] ghost that is in you now you know we we
[2:04:49] got different ideas you know many times
[2:04:52] about how to do this and I I met a man
[2:04:55] One Time by the name of Ernie fander I
[2:04:57] met him up in Washington and he was a
[2:04:59] man brother bradam talked about on tape
[2:05:01] and uh he was he was a a man that was
[2:05:05] well he he didn't really believe in God
[2:05:08] or anything else and somebody went to
[2:05:10] the meeting he saw that they got healed
[2:05:12] he went there and had his own heart
[2:05:14] discerned and he got he got saved and
[2:05:17] and uh you know but his wife wasn't
[2:05:20] saved
[2:05:22] so when he would come home she would be
[2:05:27] standing at the door just as soon as he
[2:05:30] got to got home and it would start
[2:05:32] balling him out for being coming home
[2:05:34] late from the meeting I wonder if she
[2:05:37] did that when he was at the bar but
[2:05:41] nevertheless because he had turned
[2:05:44] religious because she had been going to
[2:05:46] this Holy Ghost meeting you know she she
[2:05:49] was all upset and of course Ernie he
[2:05:51] recognized it as the devil and of course
[2:05:53] it was the devil and he said you know
[2:05:56] brother bradam said I'm bigger than her
[2:05:58] she's just a little bitty woman and I
[2:06:00] can hold her and he said I'll get her by
[2:06:03] the hand and I won't let go of her and
[2:06:05] you know and and I just try to cast The
[2:06:08] Devil out of her as hard as I
[2:06:12] can and I I stand there and said devil
[2:06:16] now you come out of my
[2:06:17] wife devil come out of my wife honey
[2:06:21] you're POS possess to the devil that's
[2:06:22] what's the matter with you come out of
[2:06:24] her
[2:06:26] devil well I tell you what if you want
[2:06:29] to change the atmosphere don't call your
[2:06:32] wife a
[2:06:37] devil please if you ever listen to
[2:06:41] me don't call her a
[2:06:45] devil and he saidwell brother Pander
[2:06:48] saidou going Ernie you're going at this
[2:06:50] the wrong way
[2:06:52] and he says well how do I do it so when
[2:06:55] you go come home bring her a box of
[2:06:59] candy oh
[2:07:01] goodness if you get candy this
[2:07:06] week maybe you ought to wait a
[2:07:12] week but he said bring her a box of
[2:07:14] candy and give it to her when you come
[2:07:16] at the door and put your arm around her
[2:07:19] and and he said that's the way you cast
[2:07:21] out the devil love casts out fear
[2:07:23] doesn't it fear is of the devil fear
[2:07:26] have torment perfect love will cast it
[2:07:29] out well perfect love will cast out of
[2:07:30] any
[2:07:31] devil hey if it will make Hornets go

[2:07:40] make your killer husband go lay down or
[2:07:43] your Hornet be sting and wife go back to
[2:07:47] her
[2:07:50] nest you

[2:07:58] love your children are dying for love
[2:08:02] your spouses are dying for love what why
[2:08:04] do you think the Bible said husband love
[2:08:07] your
[2:08:09] wives well cuz he knew men have trouble
[2:08:16] loving so he
[2:08:18] says woman reverence your husband
[2:08:22] because women have trouble with
[2:08:28] headship
[2:08:30] mhm but you
[2:08:32] see it's love that's what brings it
[2:08:36] together the
[2:08:37] mor that makes the things of God operate
[2:08:41] per perfectly is love one for another we
[2:08:43] want great gifts and oh my goodness but
[2:08:46] love is what makes it all work
[2:08:49] perfectly you see a again brother Bram
[2:08:52] told about another situation of a young
[2:08:54] Pentecostal and his wife was a staunched
[2:08:57] Lutheran and she when he came home she
[2:08:59] said well I guess she went down there
[2:09:01] and shouted last night I guess she was
[2:09:03] all speaking in tongues and doing all
[2:09:05] this last night and so he got down on
[2:09:08] the floor and said God I cast this devil
[2:09:11] out of her it was almost a divorce
[2:09:14] case and he came to brother brandham and
[2:09:16] said I guess we're going to have a
[2:09:18] divorce I just can't get the devil to
[2:09:20] move out of her
[2:09:24] he said brother you're wrong you're
[2:09:26] going at it wrong and I said when she
[2:09:29] starts like that say all right dear
[2:09:33] bless your hearts honey be real kind to
[2:09:35] her and see my how much you can do for
[2:09:38] her well brother brandham how will I
[2:09:41] ever get the devil out of you do as I
[2:09:43] say and keep praying in your heart and
[2:09:44] God will take the care of the rest of
[2:09:48] it so what am I telling you love the
[2:09:51] devil out of your
[2:09:56] wife love the devil out of your
[2:10:00] husband love the devil out of your
[2:10:03] kids amen you know he said he called
[2:10:07] This Man Called brother brand him up a
[2:10:08] few weeks later and he said you know my
[2:10:10] home is revolutionized my wife's a
[2:10:12] different person now I wonder who was
[2:10:15] different it had to start with
[2:10:18] him his whole attitude his response
[2:10:23] that's right the way that he was
[2:10:24] handling the atmosphere that he
[2:10:27] created hello it was just as much a
[2:10:31] change in him as it was in
[2:10:34] her so he said what is the most powerful
[2:10:37] screaming kicking stomping or putting
[2:10:39] your arms
[2:10:40] around in
[2:10:44] love God is love God so loved the world
[2:10:48] now
[2:10:50] remember if it's about drawing virtue or
[2:10:54] people being able to draw virtue from
[2:10:58] you
[2:11:00] strength so if it worked for Jesus it'll
[2:11:05] work for
[2:11:08] you and we create an atmosphere each one
[2:11:11] of us you know like like I said would
[2:11:14] you love to to be in the atmosphere
[2:11:18] where Jesus created would you love just
[2:11:21] to be around
[2:11:22] him to to you know it's just one big
[2:11:25] bundle of love and and respects and and
[2:11:28] godly
[2:11:30] fear but you know what with Jesus on the
[2:11:33] inside of you you can produce the same
[2:11:36] atmosphere Jesus
[2:11:39] produced that's right you see our
[2:11:42] character molds the image that we
[2:11:46] are and and as you live so is your
[2:11:49] character mold you to be what you are
[2:11:53] that's why there are those that you love
[2:11:55] to be around that may not be in your
[2:11:57] bracket of society or whatever else but
[2:11:59] you just love to be around them well it
[2:12:02] that may may be of A different race the
[2:12:04] brown or the black or the yellow or the
[2:12:06] or or whatever but there's something
[2:12:08] about that character that you just love
[2:12:10] to be in their
[2:12:11] presence because every person is a
[2:12:15] little Dynamo of their own you're you're
[2:12:17] cranking out an
[2:12:20] atmosphere and and of course you know
[2:12:23] brother brandham had things to say about
[2:12:27] family
[2:12:29] relationships he he talked about this in
[2:12:32] a message after the Seven Seals so you
[2:12:34] know it's still pretty

[2:13:24] vision we want to
[2:13:28] see until your your patience he says get
[2:13:31] from about that long till it don't have
[2:13:33] any end that's right anybody just keeps
[2:13:37] saying things about you well I don't

[2:14:08] so you say now brother shame on
[2:14:11] you oh but if you say oh is that so and
[2:14:14] listen to that Scandal he said the holy
[2:14:17] spirit is not a Cess poo that's right
[2:14:20] amen
[2:14:22] you know sometimes you you need to say
[2:14:25] is my ear a garbage can
[2:14:29] that's you know the heart occupied by
[2:14:33] this holy spirit is full of Holiness
[2:14:35] Purity it thinketh no evil doeth no evil
[2:14:39] believeth all things endureth it's
[2:14:42] longsuffering don't
[2:14:44] fuss so here's a rule in your home in
[2:14:48] your relationships whether it's on the
[2:14:50] job whether it's at school whether it's
[2:14:52] with siblings whether it's with parents
[2:14:54] whether it's with with with um husband
[2:14:57] and wife don't fuss rule number one
[2:15:00] don't
[2:15:05] fuss why the holy spirit is not a
[2:15:08] cesspool that's right and when the
[2:15:11] family gets in a fuss don't fuss with
[2:15:14] them you know it takes two to have an
[2:15:18] argument that's right your mother said I
[2:15:22] ain't going to have you going up there
[2:15:23] at that old church anymore well you all
[2:15:26] think about it now you're letting have

[2:15:40] temper so now we know something
[2:15:43] different something else your temper
[2:15:45] will only breed more
[2:15:47] Temple now so first thing you know you
[2:15:51] breathe the holy spirit away from you
[2:15:54] you'll be fastened back then the holy
[2:15:55] spirit will take its flight temper
[2:15:58] breathes
[2:16:00] temper but love breeds love be full of
[2:16:05] love this will all men know you are my
[2:16:07] disciples when you have love one for
[2:16:10] another that's the fruit of the spirit
[2:16:13] you know you're a little Creator
[2:16:15] yourself you've seen people you just
[2:16:17] love to be around you don't know why but
[2:16:19] just that loving type of person have you
[2:16:21] seen that just is kind you like to be
[2:16:24] around them they create that Atmosphere
[2:16:26] by the life they live the way they talk
[2:16:28] their conversation you see those that
[2:16:30] every time you you shun them all the all
[2:16:34] time they want to talk about something
[2:16:36] evil talk about somebody they're going
[2:16:38] to criticize somebody he's in here now
[2:16:41] he's going to talk about this man
[2:16:42] they're going to tell they're all
[2:16:44] they're going to do is tell dirty jokes
[2:16:46] or something about women or something
[2:16:48] like that you just hate to get around
[2:16:49] them they create seemingly pretty nice
[2:16:52] people but they create that atmosphere
[2:16:54] the things you think on the things you
[2:16:56] do the actions the things you talk about
[2:16:59] creates an
[2:17:01] atmosphere so now we learn what what
[2:17:04] helps create atmosphere things you're
[2:17:06] thinking on so first of all get your
[2:17:09] thoughts back on
[2:17:12] him amen I'm going to have a good
[2:17:16] marriage I'm going to have a good
[2:17:19] home my children will be in
[2:17:22] peace there's going to be love among us
[2:17:25] we will not tolerate nothing else we
[2:17:27] will not accept anything less we're
[2:17:29] going to have the peace of God that
[2:17:31] surpasses all understanding to be
[2:17:34] ours and we're going to show
[2:17:37] it but first we got to think on
[2:17:40] it we got to have the right kind of
[2:17:43] attitude toward it the actions then what
[2:17:46] your thoughts are then put it in
[2:17:49] actions amen I mean this is same thing
[2:17:53] is is you you get prayed for and then
[2:17:56] you go acting like you're healed
[2:17:58] confessing
[2:17:59] it amen the same thing you do for your
[2:18:02] family you begin to think on the right
[2:18:04] things and then you go to acting like it
[2:18:07] amen my family is healed my family is
[2:18:10] sealed my family is part of the Kingdom
[2:18:14] we are children of the most high God our
[2:18:16] character is like
[2:18:18] his and the things you think on the
[2:18:20] things you do the actions things you
[2:18:22] talk about create an atmosphere the
[2:18:25] crowd you associate
[2:18:28] with you see you can tell a person by
[2:18:32] his
[2:18:37] friends you can tell what a person is by
[2:18:40] what they read or what they look at or
[2:18:43] what you know things that that they're
[2:18:45] associating with you can know what kind
[2:18:47] of spirits in
[2:18:48] them amen so you see a Gody might claim
[2:18:52] to be one thing but his actions is
[2:18:55] speaking louder than his words but it
[2:18:57] all starts around begin to think on good
[2:19:00] things things that are good report
[2:19:03] things that are pure things that are
[2:19:07] holy come on Amen so you see again the
[2:19:12] the same thing you know it must be a a
[2:19:15] life that is worthy of the gospel and
[2:19:19] and you have to find things that are in
[2:19:22] common and there's one thing that binds
[2:19:25] us all together now some of you you like
[2:19:27] hunting the other might like fishing the
[2:19:29] other might like whatever else their
[2:19:32] their their their deal or whatever I I
[2:19:35] don't know people's got different
[2:19:37] interest some of you can tell me about
[2:19:39] cars and I ain't got a clue of what
[2:19:41] you're talking
[2:19:42] about but let me tell you there is one
[2:19:45] thing we got in common and that is
[2:19:48] Christ and that's where you build your
[2:19:50] relationship with each other on is on
[2:19:54] Christ and Christ should be the center
[2:19:58] of every family of every relationship
[2:20:01] boy and girl it should be first Christ
[2:20:04] centered on him you know the man and
[2:20:07] wife kept centered on Christ whether
[2:20:09] it's whether it's relationships with
[2:20:11] friend keep it centered on Christ
[2:20:14] everything on Jesus are you with me amen
[2:20:18] cuz that's the same thing that is in
[2:20:20] common like brother Brandon talked about
[2:20:21] a family that was splitting up and uh
[2:20:24] you know the attorney said listen you
[2:20:26] know when the when the lawyers get a
[2:20:28] hold of this they're going to take you
[2:20:29] for everything you better go down and
[2:20:31] divide the spoils yourself you know you
[2:20:33] shouldn't you shouldn't separate you
[2:20:35] shouldn't divorce but I tell you you're
[2:20:37] going to have to divide your the stuff
[2:20:40] that you have so they went into one room
[2:20:42] and and and they were fussing and steing
[2:20:45] and I bought this and I had that and my
[2:20:47] mother gave this and you know and and
[2:20:50] and they was fighting over everything
[2:20:52] you know quarreling back and forth they
[2:20:54] finally got up in the attic and and they
[2:20:57] found an old trunk and this was my
[2:20:59] mama's and this was this is mine and and
[2:21:02] they could they were D dividing up they
[2:21:04] couldn't agree and I you know I paid for
[2:21:07] that well I did the work uh I stayed
[2:21:10] home while you did it and just fussing
[2:21:13] back and forth and finally you know
[2:21:16] there was something they saw in there
[2:21:18] that they reached smok and grabbed it
[2:21:20] this same time it was a little pair of
[2:21:23] baby
[2:21:24] shoes of a of a baby that had come from
[2:21:29] their Union little shoes that you know
[2:21:34] that was of a little
[2:21:36] child and that had been taken from their
[2:21:39] home and and they dar is held it and
[2:21:42] they looked at each other one couldn't
[2:21:45] say it's mine and the other couldn't say
[2:21:47] no it's mine it was both of theirs
[2:21:51] they found something in
[2:21:53] common and she remembered who the father
[2:21:57] was and he remembered she was the
[2:22:02] mother and as they held those shoes in
[2:22:04] his hand they pulled one another to get
[2:22:07] each other and put their arms around
[2:22:08] each other and the divorce case was over
[2:22:12] because they found something in
[2:22:14] common if we will keep Christ in
[2:22:19] common if will keep him in common in
[2:22:22] this church the little things of mine
[2:22:25] and this and that and my way your way
[2:22:27] this that that and little arguments and
[2:22:30] F if you just get Christ in
[2:22:33] common and you'll realize that's what
[2:22:36] the thread that makes us all one is him
[2:22:40] and keep him centered and focused then
[2:22:43] all the other things of he didn't speak
[2:22:45] to me and she didn't do this and they
[2:22:48] ignored me and this and that and the
[2:22:50] other all the other stuff will just all
[2:22:52] go away because Christ is in
[2:22:56] common and if you get that in your
[2:22:58] marriage the same thing where Christ is
[2:23:01] walks in
[2:23:03] common and you realize we have all of
[2:23:06] this because of
[2:23:10] Jesus
[2:23:13] now you want to come
[2:23:19] down you want to come down to the end of
[2:23:22] your
[2:23:23] life with no
[2:23:30] regrets last
[2:23:32] conversation Karen and I
[2:23:36] had she would go in the hospital for her
[2:23:38] last
[2:23:44] time and I'd
[2:23:47] say Karen I I don't know what's going to
[2:23:50] happen
[2:23:51] the Lord's brought us through you went
[2:23:53] through brain bleeds and God healed you
[2:23:55] and gave you six more years and and you
[2:23:58] had another brain bleed and you came
[2:24:01] through the surgery they said you were
[2:24:02] going to
[2:24:04] die and that you'd never live God's
[2:24:07] given us another year
[2:24:09] together I said I sat
[2:24:12] there when you had that brain bleeding
[2:24:14] they did that
[2:24:16] surgery they they had they had come and
[2:24:19] told me look
[2:24:21] there's no way your wife can
[2:24:24] live this is a major brain bleed she
[2:24:27] will never
[2:24:29] live and you know you you should sign
[2:24:32] these papers and so on like this it was
[2:24:35] during covid I couldn't even go in the
[2:24:37] hospital to see her I was outside they
[2:24:41] bring me messages outside sitting in the
[2:24:43] car and I'd say I I said well you
[2:24:47] know give her her fun where she can talk
[2:24:51] to me said you don't understand
[2:24:53] sir she cannot talk we've intubated her
[2:24:57] now but she had already lost conscience
[2:25:02] and there's no
[2:25:04] hope her life is
[2:25:07] over and I sat with Timothy in the
[2:25:09] living room of my
[2:25:13] house he come he had left from where he
[2:25:16] was coming back from Arkansas he rented
[2:25:19] a hotel up there some hours away then he

[2:25:35] doors are
[2:25:36] closed and I sitting there and he walks
[2:25:41] in and I said well son I said I don't
[2:25:44] know it could all be
[2:25:46] over this may be the end
[2:25:50] I don't know I said but I'll tell you
[2:25:53] this I said I have no
[2:26:00] regrets I said you
[2:26:03] know we've lived our life and if today
[2:26:07] is her last day I have no
[2:26:13] regrets and uh so a year would go and
[2:26:17] you know you gave her that welcome in
[2:26:19] home party and she danced out there on
[2:26:24] in front of the house and you got it all
[2:26:27] on
[2:26:28] video beautiful wonderful great memories
[2:26:32] thank you for loving
[2:26:34] us but I sat there in that that room
[2:26:38] with her that
[2:26:39] day in the emergency room and they had
[2:26:42] come and said you got another brain
[2:26:44] bleed and we're going to put you in
[2:26:48] ICU and she said Tim I don't want
[2:26:50] another brain surgery I said I don't
[2:26:52] think they're going to do that I think I
[2:26:54] don't think they can said I think
[2:26:56] they're just going to observe you and
[2:26:59] hopefully you know we can get past this
[2:27:02] you can get back home I said but we
[2:27:04] don't know the
[2:27:05] future I said
[2:27:08] Karen if God would call you if this
[2:27:10] would be the time that God would call
[2:27:14] you I said I sat a year ago and I said I
[2:27:19] have no
[2:27:23] regrets I said if this was the last day
[2:27:25] I said now we've been married 45 years
[2:27:29] and I can say still I have no
[2:27:33] regrets said how do you feel about it
[2:27:36] and of course the brain was being filled
[2:27:38] with blood she was getting darker by the
[2:27:42] minute and she looked over at me took me
[2:27:45] by the hand and said
[2:27:47] Tim I have no regrets
[2:27:52] I've had a good
[2:27:55] life when you come down to the
[2:27:59] end you don't want no
[2:28:04] regrets and you don't know when the end
[2:28:07] will
[2:28:09] come so you want to know you've did
[2:28:12] everything possible to do
[2:28:16] right that you let your life shine
[2:28:21] and that you had enough
[2:28:23] virtue that when other people
[2:28:26] needed something from you that you
[2:28:29] didn't you know the check didn't bounce
[2:28:32] and come back insufficient
[2:28:36] funds that you know somebody you know
[2:28:39] didn't look at you day today claiming to
[2:28:42] be a Christian and tomorrow seeing you
[2:28:45] acting like a sinner cuz there ain't
[2:28:47] much virtue can be dra from that
[2:28:51] virtue must be in
[2:28:53] us and God requires
[2:28:57] it when brother Brandon would look in
[2:28:59] these situations he said
[2:29:02] look you know I I I didn't fuss at my
[2:29:05] wife I just said that's right honey it's
[2:29:08] been bad today you know people have been
[2:29:11] in and out and they're all nervous and
[2:29:14] they're tore up and they're wanting
[2:29:15] healing and my family now is all tore up
[2:29:19] and and all the time he said in my heart
[2:29:23] I'm now trying to create this different
[2:29:25] atmosphere you know sometimes it ain't
[2:29:27] easy sometimes you come
[2:29:30] home sometimes you come home from work
[2:29:33] and the atmosphere isn't right and
[2:29:34] you're then you get angry it should be
[2:29:37] different around here I I should have
[2:29:38] some peace here I think things should
[2:29:41] you know stop a
[2:29:43] minute yeah the devil he works
[2:29:46] overtime he never
[2:29:49] sleeps so when you come home and you
[2:29:51] find it that way realize I'm a
[2:29:54] Creator and this is my opportunity to
[2:29:57] let my faith go to
[2:30:01] work so what am I going to do I'm going
[2:30:04] to change the atmosphere here not not
[2:30:06] with scolding ah if you were a real
[2:30:09] Christian you'd have seen these Miracles
[2:30:11] you see that girl with the braces and
[2:30:13] and she was healed and you're an
[2:30:15] ungrateful woman I'll tell you you know
[2:30:16] you just don't recognize who your
[2:30:18] husband is and no he didn't say none of
[2:30:20] that no scolding no fussing just begin
[2:30:23] to pray in this heart said
[2:30:25] Lord I got to create a different
[2:30:29] atmosphere so you know instead
[2:30:33] of instead of complaining and fussing he

[2:34:32] others same way with a wife to a husband
[2:34:35] it it ain't all about
[2:34:38] you it's about keeping Jesus focused in
[2:34:42] your
[2:34:43] life and whatever you do don't help the
[2:34:46] accuser of the Brethren out that's right
[2:34:50] don't be an advocate for the devil and
[2:34:53] be Anointed with an evil spirit by
[2:34:56] letting him use your tongue your family
[2:34:59] your family members have enough trouble
[2:35:01] holding their head up because of the
[2:35:04] accuser don't be his backer don't be a
[2:35:07] tool that he can speak
[2:35:09] through but what he did he just tried to
[2:35:12] get her spirit
[2:35:14] quietened what was he
[2:35:17] doing what was he doing applying the
[2:35:24] token applying the
[2:35:30] token the same holy spirit that healed
[2:35:33] the crippled
[2:35:35] child where braces were removed as he
[2:35:38] prayed in the home was now being
[2:35:42] applied to bring healing to his
[2:35:48] family
[2:35:54] consider your wife consider your
[2:35:56] husband consider your family consider
[2:35:59] your
[2:36:02] parents self-
[2:36:04] sacrifice that's what that day on
[2:36:07] Calvary meant was he gave his life for
[2:36:10] you so you in turn be like Jesus and
[2:36:15] live your life for
[2:36:18] others
[2:36:20] the token isn't just running down the
[2:36:25] a it isn't just speaking in tongues or
[2:36:28] interpreting a
[2:36:30] message it isn't a holy and
[2:36:33] without
[2:36:36] attitude the token is the Life of Christ
[2:36:40] in every aspect of our life bringing
[2:36:43] healing to our home healing to our
[2:36:46] family there is a lamb for your house
[2:36:51] yes and that blood must be
