[55:29] I'd like to speak to you again
[55:31] on the light the light the guide amen I
[55:36] believe he is our God thing I'm thankful
[55:38] for that guide amen Exodus chapter 23
[55:41] and verse 20 and I'll be honest with you
[55:43] it's hard to read this one verse without
[55:46] shouting
[55:48] amen behold I send an angel before thee
[55:52] to keep thee in the way and to bring
[55:55] thee and to the place which I have
[55:58] prepared
[56:01] Amen to keep thee to bring thee to a
[56:04] prepared Place John chapter 16 and verse
[56:07] 7 says nevertheless I tell you the truth
[56:11] it is expedient for you that I go away
[56:13] that if I go not away the comforter will
[56:16] not come unto you but if I depart I will
[56:19] send him unto you and when he has come
[56:22] he will reprove the world of sin and of
[56:25] righteousness and of Judgment of sin
[56:27] because they believe not on me of
[56:29] righteousness because I go to my father
[56:31] and you see me no more of judgment
[56:34] because of the prince of this world is
[56:36] judged I have yet many things to say
[56:39] unto you but you cannot bear them now
[56:42] how be it when he the spirit of Truth
[56:44] has come he will guide you into all
[56:47] Truth for he shall not speak of himself
[56:50] but whatsoever he shall hear that he
[56:53] shall speak and he shall show you things
[56:55] to come he shall glorify me for he shall
[56:58] he shall receive save of mine and shall
[57:02] show it unto you amen we let you be
[57:05] seated today
[57:08] I said I'd like to speak to you on the
[57:11] light the guide a guide is someone that
[57:15] you get you know when you go to a place
[57:17] that's unfamiliar and you don't know
[57:19] exactly what roads you might want to
[57:21] take or or what things you want to see
[57:24] or or maybe you want to go on a special
[57:26] fishing trip or a hunt you find somebody
[57:29] who who's been there before a man who's
[57:31] there to get that's to guide you someone
[57:34] to show you around and amen you have to
[57:37] have a god when you don't know where
[57:39] you're going
[57:40] and you know I was thinking about this
[57:42] one here a few years ago me and sister
[57:44] Ruth and brother Danny and sister
[57:46] Michelle steamman amen took a trip over
[57:48] to Europe Priests of youth meeting there
[57:50] and then would go from there to spend a
[57:53] few days in Paris and Paris was a very
[57:55] big city it's uh it's almost uh
[57:58] Indescribable how how massive it is and
[58:01] how far reaching it is and an airplane
[58:04] seems like you can fly over it for a
[58:06] long time and you look down you see all
[58:09] these things and all these buildings and
[58:10] then you get down there there's many
[58:12] streets that leaves many directions
[58:13] there's many things down there that you
[58:15] would like to see but you don't
[58:16] necessarily know how to go about it and
[58:19] you don't know the language you don't
[58:20] know the signs you don't know amen
[58:22] because you're not from there you've
[58:23] never been there and so you know we what
[58:25] we did we found a guide that was a
[58:28] sister in Brother David Mayer's church
[58:29] had been to Paris many times and she
[58:32] knew the area she spoke the language and
[58:34] so it was very easy with for her to go
[58:36] down and decide okay we want to go here
[58:38] so we're going to take this street we're
[58:39] going to take this this bus we're going
[58:41] to take this whatever we would have to
[58:42] take to get there she knew exactly the
[58:44] way that we would go and it made it very
[58:47] very easy for us and saved us a lot of
[58:49] trouble and saved us a lot of Heartache
[58:51] amen even though there was things that
[58:54] were not working
[58:55] specifically right in that time because
[58:58] there was strikes going on and and the
[59:00] underground stuff that was supposed to
[59:02] be easier was not available but she was
[59:04] able to navigate around all of that and
[59:07] get us to the place that we wanted to go
[59:09] and I'm thankful today that we have a
[59:11] guide we you know we've never been here
[59:13] but he's already been here he's already
[59:16] been through whatever we're going
[59:17] through in whatever situation that we
[59:19] find ourselves so amen things may not be
[59:22] working rights things may seem to be
[59:24] going against what we think or how we
[59:25] think but he's able to navigate it all
[59:28] he's able to go around it he's able to
[59:31] move through it he's able to move above
[59:32] it he's a guide amen and I'm thankful
[59:34] for that God today a God has to know the
[59:37] way he has to know what what he's doing
[59:40] he has to know where he's going he has
[59:42] to know how to take care of you along
[59:44] the road amen he's got to see that you
[59:48] don't become of Lost
[59:51] Hallelujah this God you know is a
[59:53] selected man if anything happens to you
[59:56] it is his responsibility

[1:00:01] he's got to take care of you he's got to
[1:00:04] see that you not get lost he's got to
[1:00:07] see that you make it to your destination
[1:00:10] and I'm thankful that I have a God that
[1:00:12] I can rely on it's not a GPS system
[1:00:15] that'll that'll lead you down some back
[1:00:17] road somewhere and you realize where am
[1:00:19] I at why am I doing here or some man
[1:00:21] that maybe maybe thought he knew a
[1:00:23] Direction but didn't realize a bridge
[1:00:25] was out or didn't realize this was going
[1:00:27] on or didn't realize that this God knows
[1:00:29] all about it he knows every pothole he
[1:00:32] knows every ditch he knows every
[1:00:34] struggle he knows every trouble he knows
[1:00:36] how to navigate above above and beyond

[1:00:41] cannot go through or get around so if
[1:00:43] you get lost he knows exactly how to get
[1:00:46] you out

[1:00:50] situation he knows exactly how to save
[1:00:53] you there's nobody too lost there's no
[1:00:55] fighting too far that this God cannot go
[1:00:58] to where they're at and bring them out
[1:01:00] and bring them back to safety amen it's
[1:01:03] his responsibility to find every one of
[1:01:05] his that are lost every one of his that
[1:01:08] are broke down every one of his that are
[1:01:10] having issues in trouble he is a God and
[1:01:13] he will make sure they make it safely

[1:01:18] unless you go through certain tests or
[1:01:19] you go through certain things amen if
[1:01:21] you want to be a God to go out into the
[1:01:24] Wilderness say you just can't decide
[1:01:25] that you've got to go through train and
[1:01:27] you got to go through testing you got to

[1:02:15] way there's let's go this way you want a
[1:02:17] God who knows exactly what he's doing
[1:02:20] and I thank God the Church of the Living

[1:02:25] dangers that are down this road or down
[1:02:27] that road and he knows exactly how to
[1:02:29] direct every person to their destination

[1:02:35] there it's not my responsibility it's
[1:02:38] his responsibility it's not your
[1:02:40] responsibility it's his responsibility
[1:02:43] and he's more than capable of getting
[1:02:45] this bride through the darkness of him
[1:02:48] changes into a rapture
[1:02:51] Hallelujah he's a god regardless of the
[1:02:54] weather regardless of the climate

[1:03:04] us through
[1:03:08] amen the God knows how to look at
[1:03:10] certain things he knows how to how to
[1:03:12] see brother Brown said there's tricks to
[1:03:14] a good God he can see stars he can watch
[1:03:16] the stars and and there's the North
[1:03:18] Stars we know as it stands there in a
[1:03:20] certain place in a certain position he's
[1:03:22] standing there as a testimony of Jesus
[1:03:25] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:03:27] forever and it Remains the Same it's
[1:03:29] never changing but just say there's some
[1:03:31] clouds over those stars and you can't
[1:03:33] see them amen if a reason a real God he
[1:03:36] can go to something else he can look at
[1:03:37] the moss on a certain side of a tree he
[1:03:39] can he can touch certain things maybe
[1:03:41] maybe the wind's blowing so hard and
[1:03:43] it's so dark he can't see the Moss but
[1:03:45] he can put his hands on his on a tree
[1:03:47] and he can feel the bark and he can tell
[1:03:50] you if it's north or if it's South amen
[1:03:52] because he has been trained in those
[1:03:54] matters
[1:03:56] glory to God I'm thankful we serve a god
[1:03:59] who's trained in these matters
[1:04:02] in the matters of what matters to
[1:04:04] humanity he is trained what matters to
[1:04:07] you he is trained what matters to the
[1:04:10] Church of the Living God he is trying
[1:04:12] amen you can feel it maybe I don't feel
[1:04:14] don't feel no difference that don't
[1:04:16] matter to him he can feel and say it's
[1:04:18] already done
[1:04:20] come on now he can feel it and say it's
[1:04:23] over with it's finished amen it's done
[1:04:26] you you may not feel no different you
[1:04:28] can feel on it all you want to and not
[1:04:30] feel no different but this guy is
[1:04:32] sensitive to know that his word will be
[1:04:35] fulfilled his word will not fall the
[1:04:37] side to the Wayside and become void and
[1:04:40] unfulfilled but it will be fulfilled so
[1:04:43] it doesn't matter if you can feel it or
[1:04:45] not it matters if he knows it or not and
[1:04:48] he knows that his word will be fulfilled
[1:04:54] you ever see a man that's lost
[1:04:58] a man that gets real lost out in the
[1:05:00] woods
[1:05:00] it can be very pitiful thing they can
[1:05:03] actually what they call go on an Indian
[1:05:05] Death March and just go around in
[1:05:06] circles thinking they're going the right
[1:05:08] direction
[1:05:09] anyway if he gets lost many times
[1:05:11] they'll lose their minds and they'll uh
[1:05:14] they'll actually forget who they are and
[1:05:17] all kind it can get very very difficult
[1:05:19] because Panic sets in and anxiety Takes
[1:05:22] Over In Fear And it dulls the senses to
[1:05:25] where they can't tell directions no more
[1:05:27] and they'll just circle around the same
[1:05:29] old place and the same old place why
[1:05:31] because they're lost
[1:05:34] amen and they'll go around the same old
[1:05:36] places of what used to be and what used
[1:05:39] to be and what used to be not realizing
[1:05:41] their own Indian Death March amen but if
[1:05:44] it's a God God there he can say no
[1:05:46] you're going around in a circle what you
[1:05:48] need to do is change direction what you
[1:05:51] need to do is go down this path amen
[1:05:53] straight is the way and narrow is the
[1:05:55] gate and few there be that find it but
[1:05:57] I'm a God and I'm going to be here to
[1:05:59] make sure you make it
[1:06:01] Amen brother animals say you don't need
[1:06:03] a guy to go down the Broadway it's the
[1:06:06] easy way anybody can find that way but
[1:06:08] to find the straight and narrow path
[1:06:10] you're going to need a guy you're going
[1:06:12] to need a light to guide you you're
[1:06:14] going to need a light to bring you
[1:06:15] you're going to need a light to keep you
[1:06:17] you're going to be the light maybe the
[1:06:20] devil has prepared us something for you
[1:06:22] and he's prepared amen Destruction for
[1:06:24] you and he's prepared hell for you and
[1:06:26] he's prepared this for you and that for
[1:06:29] you but God has a prepared place
[1:06:31] [Applause]
[1:06:33] Hallelujah in his preparation goes
[1:06:35] beyond and supersedes anything the devil
[1:06:38] ever had for you the devil may have you
[1:06:41] on the Indian Death March and you're
[1:06:43] going around in a circle but there's a
[1:06:45] light here this morning that'll tap you
[1:06:47] on the shoulder and say boy go this way
[1:06:49] I have a place prepared for you and
[1:06:52] there's a light that can come and guide
[1:06:54] you through the darkest of times
[1:06:58] that God has understanding of which way
[1:07:01] to go and what to do in every moment
[1:07:05] amen he sent to God God's people God has
[1:07:08] never failed so he sends a God but you
[1:07:11] have to accept that God
[1:07:14] now what would have been if I'd have
[1:07:15] been in Paris and this sister who speaks
[1:07:18] the language and she reads the signs and
[1:07:19] and she says now we need to go down this
[1:07:21] way and I say no I think it's better to
[1:07:23] go this way
[1:07:26] well I can tell you anybody in that
[1:07:28] group that followed me was a bunch of
[1:07:29] dummies
[1:07:31] because I I don't know nothing about
[1:07:33] Paris
[1:07:34] you get me out in jail Pruitt I can take
[1:07:37] you down some roads claiming Parish I
[1:07:39] can take you down a lot of Roads maybe
[1:07:41] around some of the surrounding parishes
[1:07:43] maybe a few more roads but you get me in
[1:07:45] some of those places maybe I wouldn't
[1:07:47] know where to go one way to find
[1:07:49] anything but she had been there she had
[1:07:52] read the signs before she had been down
[1:07:55] this she had taken others this direction
[1:07:58] amen she has led others down this way
[1:08:01] and she had brought them safely to their
[1:08:03] destination now I'm not talking about a
[1:08:05] woman this morning that's not the guide
[1:08:07] I'm trying to get you to follow that God
[1:08:09] I'm trying to get you to follow is the
[1:08:11] Holy Ghost
[1:08:13] I'm not talking about a man today that's
[1:08:16] not our God that God is the Holy Ghost
[1:08:18] and he has led others this way he has
[1:08:21] brought others safely this way you think
[1:08:24] you're the only one that's ever been
[1:08:25] through sickness and the God got this is
[1:08:27] not is going to leave you no he's
[1:08:29] brought others through cancer he's
[1:08:31] brought others to ever disease he's
[1:08:33] brought others to depression he's
[1:08:35] brought them all down through there and
[1:08:37] he got them safely to their destination
[1:08:40] Florida car and if he brought others
[1:08:43] he'll bring you
[1:08:47] Hallelujah but you must trust the God
[1:08:51] he'll lead down ways that don't seem
[1:08:53] right
[1:08:56] but you must trust him
[1:08:58] you must remember who he is that he's
[1:09:02] been this way before
[1:09:04] Hallelujah Jesus said I will not leave
[1:09:07] you but I pray the father and he'll send
[1:09:10] you a comforter in this comforter when
[1:09:13] he comes he was to guide us to all truth
[1:09:17] the word of God is the truth Jesus said
[1:09:20] I am the way the truth and the life
[1:09:24] amen he's the word in the beginning
[1:09:26] what's the word and the Word was with
[1:09:27] God and the Word was God the word was
[1:09:30] made flesh unto what among us then if we
[1:09:32] follow the true real God the Holy Spirit
[1:09:36] he will tell us what he sees
[1:09:39] he'll tell us what he's heard he'll show
[1:09:42] us things that are to come
[1:09:46] thank you
[1:09:47] Hallelujah he'll show us things that are
[1:09:50] to come there you are he's going to show
[1:09:53] you things to come
[1:09:56] and when the church today rejects that
[1:09:58] how they ever going to expect to get to
[1:10:00] heaven
[1:10:01] when the Holy Spirit was sent for a guy
[1:10:03] we'll take some Cardinal some Bishop
[1:10:05] some general overseer or something like
[1:10:07] that to guide us when the Holy Spirit
[1:10:09] was given to us to God who said well
[1:10:12] praise God I got the Holy Spirit I don't
[1:10:14] need the church
[1:10:16] I don't need to go to church no more I
[1:10:18] got the Holy Ghost you're not to come to
[1:10:20] church shows you you don't got it
[1:10:23] because the word the spirit never divide
[1:10:26] never never denies the word
[1:10:31] it's the word
[1:10:36] when I'm following the god
[1:10:39] you're not following this guy
[1:10:42] no sir you well I tell you what I got
[1:10:45] enough I got enough Holy Ghost I don't
[1:10:47] have to go to church anymore
[1:10:49] well you've got the wrong God
[1:10:52] you're on your way to a crash
[1:10:56] amen you're on your way to destruction
[1:11:00] you've tricked yourself you're walking
[1:11:01] in a death Circle
[1:11:03] amen but there is a God who can lead you
[1:11:07] out of that
[1:11:08] and you say well I got hurt feelings
[1:11:10] will you think that God ain't never
[1:11:12] dealt with that before and helped
[1:11:13] somebody else through hurt feelings
[1:11:16] he knows how to direct the path
[1:11:19] he knows how to move you past the hurts
[1:11:22] and pass the difficulties and pass the
[1:11:25] problems and pass the situation but the
[1:11:27] problem is you don't trust the god
[1:11:33] you trust yourself more
[1:11:37] dare anybody to try to substitute
[1:11:39] anything other than the god
[1:11:42] if you do you'll go off the line that

[1:12:03] the way
[1:12:07] whether you're on a little dot of
[1:12:09] sickness today he knows the way through
[1:12:11] this sickness if you're on a little dot
[1:12:13] of Torment today he knows the way
[1:12:15] through that torment if you're on a
[1:12:17] little daughter of a herd or a bruise he
[1:12:20] knows the way through that
[1:12:22] trust the god
[1:12:24] if you're on a little daughter called
[1:12:26] Death he can push you through that
[1:12:29] [Applause]
[1:12:32] if you lost loved ones he knows how to
[1:12:34] you're not the only one he'll bring you
[1:12:37] through just like he brought everybody
[1:12:38] else through
[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:12:42] he knows every thought
[1:12:44] in your heart
[1:12:46] he knows everybody that's here
[1:12:49] he knows what you are who you are what
[1:12:53] you've done all about you he's God's
[1:12:56] guide the Holy Spirit and he will reveal
[1:12:58] things and tell you that he's heard and
[1:13:00] can repeat your words right back to you
[1:13:02] and say what you said
[1:13:05] he said well that only happened to
[1:13:07] brother Brandon say no it didn't the
[1:13:09] word is still the discerner of the
[1:13:10] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:13:15] brother Branham was not the god
[1:13:19] the God's still here
[1:13:23] hallelujah amen that God used him but he
[1:13:27] was not the god
[1:13:28] the God is still here the correct God he
[1:13:32] will guide you to all true and his word
[1:13:34] is the truth
[1:13:39] when Israel left Egypt for the promised
[1:13:41] land in Exodus 13 21 God knew the very
[1:13:45] Road they were going to travel before
[1:13:47] they ever took a step
[1:13:51] they didn't know but the god knew
[1:13:54] they didn't know they was about to go to
[1:13:56] their very first test right off the bat
[1:13:58] and they was going to be brought right
[1:14:00] to a place so it looked like a trap and
[1:14:02] it looked impossible they didn't know
[1:14:04] that but the god knew that
[1:14:06] God was not lost when he took him and he
[1:14:09] said I'm going to take them and I'm
[1:14:10] going to make them go this way in that
[1:14:12] way so Pharaoh will say they are
[1:14:14] entangled in the wilderness amen that
[1:14:16] God was taking them a certain way for a
[1:14:19] certain time or for a certain things
[1:14:21] those Pharaoh would come to that place
[1:14:23] where he would think wow they're trapped
[1:14:25] let's go get them
[1:14:27] let's go take them so he would come and
[1:14:30] he would unleash his Force why did he
[1:14:32] come because the God brought him there
[1:14:37] come on now he didn't come just because
[1:14:39] he thought it was a good idea he came
[1:14:41] because the god tricked him into coming
[1:14:45] he brought him there not for amen the
[1:14:48] destruction of Israel but for his
[1:14:50] destruction he said because I'm going to
[1:14:53] have my way my final victory over there
[1:14:56] is going to be right here
[1:14:58] and in the in the very beginning of time
[1:15:01] that God was already working on his path
[1:15:04] when he put a mountain in a certain
[1:15:06] place and are seeing a certain place and
[1:15:08] a desert in a certain place and he said
[1:15:10] look at here this looks like a good
[1:15:12] place for a trap I'm going to bring him
[1:15:14] right down through here I'm already
[1:15:16] rejoicing because my people is going to
[1:15:18] come right here and I can see it already
[1:15:21] amen I can see the chariot wheels coming
[1:15:23] off I can see Pharaoh die his army died
[1:15:27] I can see it all taking place
[1:15:29] [Applause]
[1:15:33] amen Pharaoh got up that morning he said
[1:15:36] where send me send me a somebody tell me
[1:15:38] what's going on out there they made it
[1:15:40] yeah
[1:15:40] well
[1:15:42] they took a wrong path looks like I can
[1:15:45] show you by our
[1:15:47] great abilities that we have and the
[1:15:50] science that we got that they have went
[1:15:53] the wrong direction
[1:15:54] they have went the opposite way and they
[1:15:57] have walked around look here I can look
[1:15:59] at them they look look at that trail
[1:16:01] they've taken it looks impossible it
[1:16:03] looks at what why what is going on there
[1:16:06] lost
[1:16:08] because Israel where they say their
[1:16:09] promised land is it's up here and they
[1:16:12] went the wrong direction
[1:16:14] they have went the wrong path and they
[1:16:17] they they don't even know what they're
[1:16:19] doing Moses I thought he learned more
[1:16:21] than that and he's just I thought he
[1:16:22] learned how to tell directions I thought
[1:16:24] we taught him the stars and I thought we
[1:16:26] taught him all about how to direct an
[1:16:27] army and how to direct people but look
[1:16:29] at him he's lost as a Goose
[1:16:33] let's go get him
[1:16:35] and he brings them out there and he gets
[1:16:37] all of his army together and he's riding
[1:16:39] towards amen he tells I know a shortcut
[1:16:42] we'll get there before they can ever get
[1:16:44] enough boats to get across that water
[1:16:46] we'll get there before they can ever
[1:16:48] build a bridge and he gets there and all
[1:16:50] of a sudden as he's coming up he sees
[1:16:53] this mass of people before he can get
[1:16:55] there he sees his light that's whirling
[1:16:57] and I'm sure about things like what is
[1:16:59] that
[1:17:01] and it comes and it stands between him
[1:17:04] and the Israelites
[1:17:06] who was that that was the god
[1:17:10] that was the pillar of fire to guide
[1:17:12] them to the promised land amen the
[1:17:15] children of Israel followed that God A
[1:17:17] Cloud by day and a fire by night it
[1:17:19] stopped they stopped
[1:17:21] it moved they moved it journeyed they
[1:17:25] journeyed if it stayed for three days
[1:17:27] they stayed for three days
[1:17:29] it was the god Moses was not the god
[1:17:36] the God was that light
[1:17:41] well what do you mean well since you
[1:17:43] brought us out here to die where they're
[1:17:44] not in graves in Egypt
[1:17:47] I'm sure it was probably more through it
[1:17:49] than that
[1:17:54] it's been almost it's been what almost
[1:17:57] 60 years since the prophet died
[1:18:03] why are we still here
[1:18:06] because the God's still here
[1:18:11] when the god moves we're going to move
[1:18:15] that God has only erased all of this so
[1:18:19] that all the enemy can flood into this
[1:18:21] place
[1:18:23] and he's allowed there you River of
[1:18:25] Euphrates to be opened up the who has
[1:18:27] allowed it the God has allowed it not
[1:18:30] the devil the god he has allowed them to
[1:18:33] come to this place why for their
[1:18:36] destruction
[1:18:38] hey he has not brought you to 2022 to
[1:18:42] die in a in a wallow and die in your
[1:18:45] grief and you're hacking it he's brought
[1:18:47] you here for one moment
[1:18:49] I want you to understand the Red Sea is
[1:18:52] not a place of Agony the great sea is
[1:18:55] not a praise of crying and moaning the
[1:18:57] Red Sea is a place of victory
[1:19:01] Hallelujah and I want you to understand
[1:19:03] whatever hits you're on this morning is
[1:19:06] not a place for Agony it's not a place
[1:19:09] for greed it's not a place for you to
[1:19:11] get down and adultery you realize
[1:19:13] this inch that I'm all he's only with me
[1:19:17] and as long as he's here I'm still
[1:19:19] moving and I'm still breathing and I'm
[1:19:22] still living
[1:19:24] this itch is a place of victory
[1:19:29] you need to declare that this morning
[1:19:31] this is that I'm on is a place of
[1:19:34] victory
[1:19:35] [Applause]
[1:19:42] Moses couldn't do this
[1:19:45] even with all of his learning that he
[1:19:47] had
[1:19:49] he couldn't provide
[1:19:51] all that was needed
[1:19:53] he needed a guide
[1:19:56] foreign
[1:19:57] Moses and his people brother Andrew
[1:20:00] Spencer sent me this this morning
[1:20:02] I said Hallelujah and I copied it and I
[1:20:04] pasted it
[1:20:05] Moses and the people were in the desert
[1:20:09] what was he going to do
[1:20:11] with two million people in a desert
[1:20:15] that's more than an inch
[1:20:19] they had to be fed
[1:20:21] into
[1:20:23] whatever two to three million people
[1:20:25] requires a whole lot of food
[1:20:29] let's just hear what our God can do
[1:20:32] according to the quartermaster General
[1:20:34] in the Army it is reported that Moses
[1:20:37] would have to have 1500 tons of food
[1:20:41] each day just to satisfy their appetite
[1:20:45] Moses gonna Supply that
[1:20:48] no no do you know that to bring that
[1:20:51] much food in each day two freight trains
[1:20:55] at least a mile long would be required
[1:21:00] besides you must remember they were in a
[1:21:03] desert so they would have to have
[1:21:04] firewood
[1:21:06] to cook the food so it would take four
[1:21:09] thousand tons of wood and a few more
[1:21:11] freight trains each a mile long just for
[1:21:15] one day
[1:21:18] and just think there were 40 years in
[1:21:20] transit oh yes they would have to have
[1:21:22] water
[1:21:25] and they only had enough just to have
[1:21:27] enough water to drink and maybe wash a
[1:21:29] few dishes it would take 11 million
[1:21:32] gallons of water a day
[1:21:37] and a Frank freight train with tank cars
[1:21:40] 1800 miles long
[1:21:44] to bring enough water for one day
[1:21:51] and then another thing they had to get
[1:21:53] across this Red Sea
[1:21:56] now if they went on a narrow path double
[1:21:58] file
[1:21:59] the line would be 800 miles long and it
[1:22:03] would require 35 days and nights to get
[1:22:05] through it
[1:22:08] so there had to be a space in the Red
[1:22:10] Sea three miles wide
[1:22:13] so they could walk five thousands of
[1:22:16] five thousand oppressed to get over in
[1:22:19] one night
[1:22:21] but then there's another problem each
[1:22:23] time they camped at the end of the day a
[1:22:26] campground two-thirds the size of the
[1:22:28] State of Rhode Island was required and a
[1:22:30] total of 750 square miles long
[1:22:37] this much space for camping
[1:22:40] do you think Moses figured all that out
[1:22:42] before he left Egypt
[1:22:47] you see Moses believed in his God
[1:22:54] and God took care of all of that
[1:22:58] Moses wasn't fretting about the firewood
[1:23:00] and none of he had all he had to do was
[1:23:03] call unto his God and God would provide
[1:23:06] it
[1:23:07] now do you think God has any problem
[1:23:10] taking care of all your needs
[1:23:15] come on somebody our God is an awesome
[1:23:18] God so in the road you're traveling
[1:23:21] seems difficult at best just remember
[1:23:24] trust the God he will do the rest
[1:23:28] can you trust the god this morning if he
[1:23:31] can provide enough water and enough
[1:23:33] firewood and enough food Amen to two
[1:23:35] million people don't you think he's got
[1:23:37] enough power for your little inch
[1:23:41] let's add all the inches up in here do
[1:23:43] you think he's got enough power
[1:23:48] let's give you a square foot
[1:23:51] the fire marshal says that each person
[1:23:53] is required I believe it was what was it
[1:23:54] three square foot of person or five
[1:23:56] somewhere right in there so I'll give
[1:23:58] you that much
[1:24:00] foreign
[1:24:01] I believe God's got enough of it we just
[1:24:03] read about what he did
[1:24:05] so if he was able to get them through to
[1:24:09] their destination
[1:24:11] the guy this guy that I'm talking about
[1:24:13] this Pillar of Fire
[1:24:14] that has that by the way has never left
[1:24:17] the church
[1:24:19] he is still here
[1:24:22] he said well I don't know about that
[1:24:25] I'd haven't seen him
[1:24:27] well don't worry about it
[1:24:29] just believe him that's all he requires
[1:24:32] do you know he does not require that you
[1:24:34] see him
[1:24:35] he requires that you believe him
[1:24:40] oh it'd be wonderful to be able to see
[1:24:42] him
[1:24:43] one day
[1:24:45] going to be able to see him face to face
[1:24:47] but what he's looking for is somebody to
[1:24:49] believe him
[1:24:51] oh it's easy to believe a god when
[1:24:53] you're in an air-conditioned car and
[1:24:55] you're riding down a highway and you you
[1:24:56] got it all figured out but when you get
[1:24:58] on foot
[1:25:00] and you're an unfamiliar City
[1:25:03] and there's all kind of dangers around
[1:25:06] let me just be honest with you
[1:25:09] we went through some sketchy looking
[1:25:11] places
[1:25:12] I know you teenagers know that word
[1:25:14] that's sketch I hear it all the time
[1:25:16] that's sketchy
[1:25:19] well it was sketchy
[1:25:21] there was people laying in tents
[1:25:24] there were
[1:25:25] Lord Jesus
[1:25:27] there was human feces all over the wall
[1:25:30] you say I can't wait to go to Paris well
[1:25:32] let me tell you some of the dirty things
[1:25:36] it may look all good from up above and
[1:25:38] pictures may make it look all great but
[1:25:41] you get down with your boots on in the
[1:25:42] city you realize wow
[1:25:44] places filthy places nasty this place is
[1:25:48] unbelievable can we make it through well
[1:25:52] the guy had said we're going this way
[1:25:54] so you know what I did I followed the
[1:25:57] guide
[1:25:59] because I felt like if I got off on any
[1:26:01] place more any other place it might be
[1:26:03] more sketchy
[1:26:07] and I didn't want more sketchy
[1:26:09] I wanted to get to where we was going
[1:26:12] amen it was a church that was on a hill
[1:26:14] that you can climb 300 something steps
[1:26:16] up and you can see a beautiful view of
[1:26:17] Paris and it was nice and it was
[1:26:18] wonderful and I was glad I made it and I
[1:26:20] was glad I made it back to my room
[1:26:23] but why because I was following the
[1:26:25] guide
[1:26:28] amen laodicea as it looks all beautiful
[1:26:32] looks all great in the pictures it looks
[1:26:35] wonderful but sometimes you get your
[1:26:37] boots on the ground and you start going
[1:26:39] through some very difficult places and
[1:26:42] it seems so dirty and so filthy and am I
[1:26:44] going to make it through and the devils
[1:26:46] are halting at you and camping out and
[1:26:48] making fun and saying this and you don't
[1:26:50] know what all he's saying he making all
[1:26:52] kind of noises
[1:26:53] and he's making all kind might be
[1:26:55] threats may not be threats I don't know
[1:26:57] and it's going out and it's going to
[1:26:59] this and saying it but if you'll just
[1:27:01] keep following the light if you'll just
[1:27:03] keep following the guy he's going to
[1:27:05] bring you safely through
[1:27:07] he's already done it before
[1:27:14] nature needs God
[1:27:16] science calls it an instinct
[1:27:18] but it's truly a guide
[1:27:20] it's the god that placed that there so
[1:27:23] they can find their way in places you
[1:27:26] know brother Adam talks about this he
[1:27:27] said have you noticed the wild geese or
[1:27:29] the Ducks going south you remember that
[1:27:31] little duck was born under on a pond
[1:27:33] somewhere he don't know east north west
[1:27:36] or south he knows nothing but what the
[1:27:38] pawn he was born in
[1:27:40] he never been off the pond but inside of
[1:27:44] him was something that was moving he was
[1:27:47] a born leader there he was born to be a
[1:27:50] leader the first thing you know one
[1:27:52] night a big snow comes across the top of
[1:27:54] the mountains what happened that cold
[1:27:56] breeze comes off of those mountains
[1:27:57] begin to blow across that that little
[1:27:59] Pond and Mammy what does this mean is he
[1:28:02] shivering I never felt that cold weather
[1:28:04] before but he began to notice around the
[1:28:06] edges of the pond things were freezing
[1:28:08] up
[1:28:14] just ain't quite as many amens no more
[1:28:18] not quite as many shouting going on no
[1:28:20] more there's a cold breeze that's
[1:28:23] blowing through
[1:28:26] it's called level to seal the flu of
[1:28:29] laodicea
[1:28:31] I know a lot of us been sick with the
[1:28:33] flu and been dealing with it listen
[1:28:34] there's a whole lot worse flu than what
[1:28:35] you've been dealing with in the last
[1:28:37] week
[1:28:38] there's recovery with that there's
[1:28:40] medications as you can take or there's
[1:28:41] whatever God can move into I see to move
[1:28:44] very supernaturally and change things
[1:28:46] God can do whatever he wants to but
[1:28:48] there's a worse flu than this flu that's
[1:28:49] going around it's the flu of laodicea
[1:28:53] and the same filtrating homes and
[1:28:55] churches and lives and things are
[1:28:57] getting froze up
[1:29:02] but if that little duck has an instinct
[1:29:04] put in there by God he'll realize listen
[1:29:07] things are getting a little tough around
[1:29:09] here and I can't handle have as much
[1:29:11] room to swim anymore
[1:29:15] come on now I don't have enough room
[1:29:17] anymore to just worship God and to give
[1:29:20] God all the praise and all the glory
[1:29:22] amen because that flu has been it's been
[1:29:25] freezing up the bank edges and it's
[1:29:27] coming closer and it's coming closer and
[1:29:29] I'm not going to stay here until I
[1:29:31] become one of the Frozen chosen
[1:29:35] no something begins to honk on the
[1:29:37] inside of him this is the prophet of God

[1:29:41] pond

[1:29:55] said I call it inspiration it's down on
[1:29:58] the inside of him he starts jumping up
[1:30:00] and flapping those wings in the middle
[1:30:02] of that pond
[1:30:04] all right
[1:30:06] the water's me in trouble that's exactly
[1:30:09] right brother here he's traveling the
[1:30:10] water and things are beginning to move
[1:30:12] and something out of him again amen amen
[1:30:15] amen
[1:30:17] what is it that God put it down there
[1:30:21] [Applause]

[1:30:29] duck
[1:30:30] that's destinated predestinated to life
[1:30:33] will gather around him
[1:30:35] and then pretty soon he'll honk and
[1:30:39] he'll swing those wings and out of that
[1:30:41] pond he's going to go
[1:30:44] Hallelujah let's bring it tomorrow amen
[1:30:47] not just about a church let's bring it
[1:30:49] to a universal bride
[1:30:53] hey man listen laodicea is trying to
[1:30:55] freeze the edges
[1:30:57] trying to freeze up our worship frees up
[1:30:59] the things of God freeze up the moving
[1:31:01] of the spirit frees up the inspiration
[1:31:03] of the Holy Ghost frees it all up
[1:31:06] the world is doing that if you're you're
[1:31:08] a part of it then you're part of the
[1:31:09] world because that's where it's coming
[1:31:10] from it's the anointing of Satan that's
[1:31:13] trying to freeze up the Waters of God
[1:31:15] hey remember what is it going to do it's
[1:31:17] going to cause some to gather in the
[1:31:19] middle
[1:31:20] and they're going to begin the rally
[1:31:22] around the word of God and the anointing
[1:31:24] of God and the shouts of God and the
[1:31:27] sound of the king that's in the camp and
[1:31:29] the fire of God Is Burning above them
[1:31:31] and they're going to start flapping
[1:31:32] those waves amen they're going to start
[1:31:35] to move and of that inspiration when
[1:31:37] that Holy Ghost moves through they're
[1:31:38] going to move with it and pretty soon
[1:31:40] that air is going to blow hard enough
[1:31:42] it's going to lift them up
[1:31:45] into a body change
[1:31:51] if he'd done it before he can do it
[1:31:54] again
[1:31:56] well how do you know he's done it before
[1:31:58] well I got a Bible That's Enoch walked
[1:32:01] with God and was not
[1:32:05] maybe he couldn't get no more ducks to
[1:32:07] go with him but he went
[1:32:10] why because there was something in him
[1:32:12] wanting more
[1:32:20] such a jubilee they'll have right in the
[1:32:21] middle of that pond turning it over and
[1:32:23] over and over
[1:32:24] and after a while he feels it moving on
[1:32:27] him he's got to leave
[1:32:29] he'll set those little wings down and
[1:32:32] fly off that pond and go and turn up in
[1:32:34] the air about four or five times
[1:32:37] and go straight to Louisiana as he can
[1:32:39] ever duck right behind him honk honk
[1:32:41] honk honk here he comes what was it the
[1:32:43] duck knows their guide
[1:32:45] and if a dump duck can follow a God how
[1:32:48] come we can't follow him
[1:32:50] if a duck can follow and trust him to
[1:32:53] lead him to places he'd never been
[1:32:55] before Amen to an area he's never been
[1:32:57] before all he's ever known is up there
[1:32:59] but something on the inside of him
[1:33:03] then why can't we trust him
[1:33:06] in sickness why can't we trust him
[1:33:09] we can
[1:33:18] brother Graham talks about in a magazine
[1:33:20] called look
[1:33:21] there was an old Gander one time
[1:33:24] he said an old Gander didn't know what
[1:33:25] he was doing
[1:33:27] and he led a bunch of geese all the way
[1:33:28] over to England
[1:33:30] they ever they've never been to England
[1:33:32] before
[1:33:34] but they didn't pay attention to their
[1:33:36] God
[1:33:37] said the old Gander didn't know what he
[1:33:39] was where he was going and now they're
[1:33:41] over there and they can't get back
[1:33:44] that's what's the matter with a whole
[1:33:45] lot of these Geeks today oh they still
[1:33:47] swarm these geese swarm and fly over
[1:33:50] England but they don't know how to get
[1:33:52] back to where they belong
[1:33:53] he said you can swarm you can have big
[1:33:56] great protracted meetings and have
[1:33:58] revivalists come along preach a while
[1:34:00] but you don't know where you're going
[1:34:01] swarming around around because you got
[1:34:02] some Gander to lead you off to a
[1:34:04] dominational spree and not back to the
[1:34:07] word of God not back to the baptism of
[1:34:10] the Holy Ghost and we wonder why we
[1:34:12] ain't got Revival in our days you got
[1:34:14] that you got to get that certain sound
[1:34:16] that sound is the gospel trumpet
[1:34:18] breathing out the gospel every word of
[1:34:21] God not Creed not denomination but the
[1:34:24] Bible the Holy Spirit the signs
[1:34:27] following them that believe
[1:34:32] there's another he's on another old
[1:34:34] Gander got a bunch of them killed trying
[1:34:36] to fly through the darkness
[1:34:37] hit up against the mountain burst them
[1:34:40] into pieces
[1:34:42] you got to find somebody something is a
[1:34:45] certain sound and that certain sound
[1:34:47] lines up with his word
[1:34:50] hallelujahs don't line up with old
[1:34:52] formalities and Creeds and dogmas and
[1:34:55] it's a GL It lines up it's glorious he
[1:34:57] said it lines up with a wonderful
[1:35:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:04] Hallelujah it brings virtue knowledge
[1:35:07] patient godliness in the Holy Spirit
[1:35:08] that's what the real God will lead you
[1:35:10] to because he'll breathe out nothing
[1:35:12] but the gospel
[1:35:15] just the word of God you need a guide
[1:35:18] brother Brown will say like he said I'm
[1:35:20] 53 years old been preaching the gospel
[1:35:23] here for 33 and a half years and I've
[1:35:25] never seen it fail I'm going to
[1:35:27] contestify that
[1:35:29] I've seen a test or tested seven times
[1:35:31] around the world all kind of religions
[1:35:33] everything else before as many as a half
[1:35:35] a million at one time and never had it
[1:35:37] fail I don't speak from some book I
[1:35:39] speak from personal experience and I
[1:35:42] know that God stands behind his word and
[1:35:44] he honors it every time now if you have
[1:35:46] some kind of creed you better watch out
[1:35:48] but the holy spirit will back up the
[1:35:51] word of God he is the word he is the god
[1:35:53] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:35:55] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:35:57] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:35:59] among his mind he said Paul was guided
[1:36:02] to say on Acts 2 38 repent every one of
[1:36:06] you and they've been baptized in the
[1:36:08] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:36:10] remission of your sin and then the God
[1:36:12] will take you on from there
[1:36:15] that God will take you on from there
[1:36:18] that's the thing to do reverse repent of
[1:36:21] all your unbelief and you disappoint you
[1:36:23] disbelieve things repent and then be
[1:36:25] baptized and the God will take you from
[1:36:28] there

[1:38:07] a trained man
[1:38:08] and he might decide he wants to preserve
[1:38:10] his life and leave but this God won't

[1:38:38] Sinai and speaketh unto them from the
[1:38:41] heaven and gave them right judgments and

[1:38:51] of Moses I servant thou gave them bread
[1:38:53] from heaven for their hunger and brought
[1:38:55] forth water oh and I would see what the
[1:38:56] God's been doing and when Moses it was
[1:38:59] him the guy brought forth water out of
[1:39:01] the rock for their thirst and promised
[1:39:03] them that they should go in the promise
[1:39:04] into the possess the land which I was
[1:39:06] sworn to give them but they and our
[1:39:09] fathers dealt proudly and hardened their
[1:39:11] necks and hearken not into thy
[1:39:12] Commandments and refuse to obey neither
[1:39:15] were mindful of their Wonders that thou
[1:39:16] didst among them but hardened their
[1:39:18] necks and their Rebellion appointed a

[1:39:46] yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsook
[1:39:52] them not in the wilderness the pillar of
[1:39:54] cloud departed not for them by day and

[1:41:15] he's always been there
[1:41:18] I'm making testify of that
[1:41:20] how many can say for what I wait but
[1:41:23] listen we ain't none of us better than
[1:41:25] anybody else in here we all were born in
[1:41:27] sin shaped iniquity
[1:41:29] come into this world speaking lies
[1:41:31] so you know what you were when you got
[1:41:33] here a liar
[1:41:36] you know what you were full of
[1:41:37] iniquities
[1:41:39] sin every kind of thing that held upon
[1:41:42] your life but God rich in Mercy came
[1:41:45] down and he found you in that pit where
[1:41:47] you was at and that pit of despair
[1:41:50] despondency and it seemed like it wasn't
[1:41:52] no way you was ever going to get out it
[1:41:55] was so dark and so deep and so slimy you
[1:41:58] tried you had tried to claw your way out
[1:42:00] of drugs you'd try to call your way out
[1:42:02] of drinking and smoking and every kind
[1:42:03] of other sin of life you tried it all
[1:42:05] and you'd clawed and you'd claw and you
[1:42:07] found yourself sinking down and down and
[1:42:10] down and down and all of a sudden though
[1:42:13] you looked up out of the darkness of
[1:42:15] that pit and up there was a light
[1:42:18] and it was whirling right over your
[1:42:21] square inch
[1:42:23] right over your little part where you
[1:42:26] was at and when you was in your
[1:42:27] despondency and your spare Despair and
[1:42:30] it reads and all of a sudden out of that
[1:42:32] light you saw it all of the complected
[1:42:34] hand
[1:42:36] reach down and thank God you never got
[1:42:40] far enough that that hand couldn't reach
[1:42:42] down far enough
[1:42:47] and it didn't call you sorry and lost
[1:42:50] and undeserving and I told you saw it
[1:42:52] and you shouldn't have ever done this
[1:42:54] you lousy person though it said I'm here
[1:42:57] with grace and mercy I'm here to reach
[1:42:59] down and pick you up
[1:43:02] and it brought you out of that pit and
[1:43:05] it began to guide you and it began to
[1:43:07] lead you and it began to move in your
[1:43:09] life and it took things off of you that
[1:43:12] you tried so hard to get off of your
[1:43:14] life and you never could break free from
[1:43:15] it you tried to quit this and you tried
[1:43:18] to quit that but all of a sudden that
[1:43:20] all of complected hand would reach over
[1:43:22] to grab that thing and just pluck It Off
[1:43:25] and just reach over there out of that
[1:43:27] dirty heart and grab that old root of
[1:43:29] lust and pick it off hey man it just
[1:43:31] kept walking with you and guiding you
[1:43:33] and leading you oh God and you would
[1:43:35] fall over here and the God would reach
[1:43:37] over and grab you and bring you back and
[1:43:40] you would fall on this side of the dish
[1:43:42] and that God would reach down and bring
[1:43:44] you back
[1:43:46] come on somebody I know I'm talking to
[1:43:49] somebody this morning he never left you
[1:43:52] you may have fallen away from him but he
[1:43:55] has not Fallen away from you you may
[1:43:58] have walked away from him but he has not
[1:44:00] walked away from you
[1:44:01] [Applause]
[1:44:08] his manifold Mercies
[1:44:13] Psalms 119 will say 10 and 105 would say
[1:44:17] Thy Word
[1:44:18] is a lamp unto my feet
[1:44:21] and a light unto my path
[1:44:25] proverbs 4 18 and 19 says but the path
[1:44:28] of the just is as a Shining Light
[1:44:32] I love the scripture right here is as a
[1:44:35] shining light that shineth more and more
[1:44:39] unto perfect day
[1:44:45] did I just y'all reading something
[1:44:47] different
[1:44:49] the path of the just is as a Shining
[1:44:52] Light
[1:44:53] that gets dimmer
[1:44:56] that goes out
[1:44:58] that turns off
[1:45:01] that signeth more and more
[1:45:06] why is it going to shine more and more
[1:45:09] because it's going to get darker
[1:45:13] listen we're not going we're not in a
[1:45:15] age it's full of light
[1:45:17] we're in an age of Darkness
[1:45:20] darkness is so covering this world to
[1:45:23] where their minds are just being totally
[1:45:25] they're lost
[1:45:27] so they become so lost they forget who
[1:45:30] they are
[1:45:32] and a man believes he's a woman and a
[1:45:35] woman believes he's a man why because
[1:45:37] they're on the Indian Death March
[1:45:39] and they're going around in a circle
[1:45:43] and they lift up the creation and begin
[1:45:45] to worship him more amen you can you can
[1:45:47] listen you can kill a baby and you can
[1:45:50] kill 100 babies they don't care but you
[1:45:51] kill one little egg of a bald eagle
[1:45:57] how many people got up in arms when
[1:46:00] there's Dr Palmer
[1:46:03] killed a lion over there and I believe
[1:46:05] it was in Africa
[1:46:06] and he killed this line that you know
[1:46:09] the media blew it up and they made all
[1:46:10] kind of accusations and things it got so
[1:46:13] bad this Dr Palmer was actually I
[1:46:15] believe from Minnesota if I remember
[1:46:16] right or somewhere way up North it got
[1:46:19] so bad that Dr Palmer and Homer started
[1:46:21] getting death threats
[1:46:25] he couldn't even hardly answer his phone
[1:46:27] no more because these people were so
[1:46:30] incensed that somebody would take a poor
[1:46:33] little Lion's eye and I understand be we
[1:46:35] need conservation I understand all of
[1:46:37] that amen but we also need men amen that
[1:46:40] abide by conservation
[1:46:43] they say Don't Do no harm it actually is
[1:46:46] helping things
[1:46:47] for hunters to be out there I know the
[1:46:49] world don't like you to know that but
[1:46:50] that's the truth
[1:46:54] amen but they get so incense and and
[1:46:56] then they can then they're going to get
[1:46:57] so incense because we dare try to take a
[1:47:00] right from them to Kill The Unborn
[1:47:02] that's in their own womb
[1:47:06] what is wrong
[1:47:07] they've been walking in darkness so long
[1:47:11] and they're walking in darkness until
[1:47:13] they've gotten so confused
[1:47:16] and they don't know what's right what's
[1:47:18] wrong what's this what's that they don't
[1:47:21] know what's what colors is pink and what
[1:47:23] colors is blue if you know what I mean
[1:47:24] they don't know nothing about anything
[1:47:26] they have completely lost all sense
[1:47:30] unto where a man or a woman can declare
[1:47:32] them whatever they want to declare
[1:47:33] themselves they can declare themselves
[1:47:35] to be a cat they can declare themselves
[1:47:37] to identify themselves to be a dog they
[1:47:39] can identify themselves of any animal
[1:47:41] any type anything whatever they want to
[1:47:43] if they want to be a wall they can be a
[1:47:45] wall
[1:47:46] what is going on they are walking in
[1:47:49] darkness
[1:47:52] so why is the light that we're walking
[1:47:55] in going to shine brighter and brighter
[1:47:58] because it's getting darker and darker
[1:48:04] in this light is leading us somewhere
[1:48:09] it's doing what it's doing on purpose
[1:48:15] I want you to understand where in 2022
[1:48:18] on purpose
[1:48:21] maybe not on my purpose or anybody
[1:48:23] else's purpose but it must be in on
[1:48:25] God's purpose God has a purpose that we
[1:48:28] are still here
[1:48:30] and he's not left us we are not by
[1:48:34] ourselves we are not alone he's still
[1:48:36] leading he's still guided he's still
[1:48:38] moving he's still directed he's still
[1:48:40] touching your life in the darkest of
[1:48:42] moment all of a sudden you he'll feel a
[1:48:44] hand bump you
[1:48:47] and he moves you over just a step
[1:48:50] take you down this way
[1:48:52] and he bumps you and it moves you back
[1:48:54] another step what is he doing he's
[1:48:56] keeping you from destruction
[1:49:06] but the Way of the Wicked
[1:49:08] verse 19 is as Darkness
[1:49:11] they know not at what they stumble
[1:49:17] did you hear that
[1:49:19] you ever been walking down a dark path
[1:49:23] and if you you know
[1:49:25] I always said this and I think I've said
[1:49:27] it from here I've not ever been scared
[1:49:29] of the dark you just get scared of the
[1:49:30] things in the dark
[1:49:34] yeah darkness of his just darkness I'd
[1:49:37] be all right but this is the stuff
[1:49:39] that's hiding in the Darkness
[1:49:40] and in the darkness your mind can go
[1:49:43] nuts
[1:49:45] we've been talking about it and then but
[1:49:48] I'm talking about just actual just
[1:49:49] darkness your mind can actually imagine
[1:49:52] things how many of you woke up in the
[1:49:55] middle of the night and you left a coat
[1:49:57] hanging over somewhere and you're
[1:49:59] absolutely 100 percent that's a serial
[1:50:01] killer
[1:50:03] I'm not talking about s or c-e-r-e-a-l
[1:50:07] killer I'm done by s-e-r-i-a-l killer
[1:50:11] serial killer
[1:50:13] and he's got a knife or a gun and he's
[1:50:16] been I can all of a sudden your mind can
[1:50:18] hear breathing
[1:50:21] it can see movement
[1:50:23] because why it's dark
[1:50:26] and it looks like something is about to
[1:50:28] get me I know and you start trying to
[1:50:30] put like you're pulling the covers it's
[1:50:32] going to do you any good
[1:50:33] but somehow in our minds in the darkness
[1:50:35] covers just feel better and we throw
[1:50:38] them covers over our head and we're just
[1:50:39] safe under our covers
[1:50:42] we are never safe under our own covering
[1:50:48] what's the first thing person a person
[1:50:50] does in darkness they start pulling up
[1:50:52] their covers
[1:50:55] something can happen and get bumped
[1:50:57] around a little bit and they pull up
[1:50:58] their religious coverage
[1:51:00] they pull up this cover and they pull up
[1:51:02] that cover trying to keep them in
[1:51:04] darkness
[1:51:06] but what you need is light
[1:51:10] amen if you'll turn on the light you'll
[1:51:13] realize hey that's my suit coat over
[1:51:16] there that's my move that's my old fur
[1:51:18] coat over there I thought for sure that
[1:51:20] was a bear that just somehow opened the
[1:51:22] door got in my room and come all the way
[1:51:24] open up three doors matter of fact I
[1:51:26] didn't hear nothing but all of a sudden
[1:51:28] that big bully bear no it's my coat
[1:51:31] why do you know that because the light
[1:51:33] started coming on
[1:51:35] as the daylight began to break it began
[1:51:38] to reveal what was around you and amen
[1:51:41] the world doesn't know it what they
[1:51:43] stumble at but you know because there's
[1:51:47] light
[1:51:48] when you stumble over something oh I
[1:51:51] didn't mean to make that mistake I
[1:51:52] didn't mean to make that why can you say
[1:51:54] that because you got like to see what it
[1:51:57] was
[1:51:57] [Applause]
[1:51:59] they don't have that
[1:52:01] so they think Well everybody's going to
[1:52:04] make it to heaven
[1:52:06] they can be Sinners they can be this
[1:52:08] they can be that long as they love Jesus
[1:52:10] and they pull that covering over
[1:52:14] his Darkness
[1:52:16] and this world is getting darker
[1:52:22] I know in our flesh we want it to get
[1:52:25] better
[1:52:26] it would be better if gas was cheaper
[1:52:30] it would be better if milk was cheaper
[1:52:33] and it's all about Earth
[1:52:38] it's all about this
[1:52:43] God's not worried about your milk being
[1:52:45] cheap
[1:52:48] he's not worried about your gas being
[1:52:50] cheap
[1:52:52] he's not worried about any of that
[1:52:55] what he's concentrating on and the angel
[1:52:58] was looking at this morning is what we
[1:53:01] read
[1:53:03] I have sent my angel before thee
[1:53:06] to keep thee
[1:53:10] so it doesn't matter if it's high or if
[1:53:12] it's low if it's good or if it's bad I'm
[1:53:14] going to keep you
[1:53:16] it doesn't matter if I'm having a you're
[1:53:18] having a good day or a bad day or up or
[1:53:20] down or your Valley or Mountain this
[1:53:22] that I'm going to keep you
[1:53:25] and not only am I keeping you I'm
[1:53:28] bringing you
[1:53:30] I am I am the one if you look back
[1:53:33] there's not two sets of footprints
[1:53:36] there's one set of footprints because
[1:53:39] I'm carrying you
[1:53:41] you are my desire you are what I I'm
[1:53:44] longing for you you are all you're the
[1:53:46] in the the the encapsulation or the
[1:53:49] Capstone of everything that's been done
[1:53:51] for 6 000 years and you think I'm gonna
[1:53:55] let it come to this moment and lose you
[1:53:57] oh God I'm not going to lose you little
[1:54:00] bride I'm going to be with you and I'm
[1:54:03] going to keep you and I'm going to bring
[1:54:05] you to a prepared place
[1:54:10] Hallelujah and if there wasn't enough
[1:54:12] Devils to stop them from going over
[1:54:15] there there's not enough Devils to stop
[1:54:18] you
[1:54:19] because the same Pillar of Fire that led
[1:54:21] them is leading you this morning
[1:54:24] You are not alone you were not by
[1:54:26] yourself God is with you and if God be
[1:54:29] for you who can be against you
[1:54:38] it's the light
[1:54:40] is guiding you
[1:54:42] it's the light
[1:54:44] that's leading you
[1:54:46] you are not
[1:54:48] doing this alone
[1:54:51] it was so brother Timothy nobody calls
[1:54:53] nobody understood cares about you are
[1:54:55] not alone
[1:54:57] it does not matter if anybody ever calls
[1:55:01] or anybody ever checks on you
[1:55:04] understand what I'm saying what I'm
[1:55:06] trying to get to you is you are not
[1:55:07] alone
[1:55:11] he's with you
[1:55:13] and that's all that matters
[1:55:18] Matthew 2 and verse 1 said now Jesus was
[1:55:21] born
[1:55:22] in Bethlehem of Judea
[1:55:24] in the days of Herod the king behold
[1:55:27] there came wise men from the East to
[1:55:29] Jerusalem
[1:55:31] saying where is he
[1:55:33] that is born King of the Jews
[1:55:36] for we have seen his star in the east
[1:55:41] and to come to worship Him
[1:55:43] so what brought them to that worship a
[1:55:46] light
[1:55:47] it was a god
[1:55:49] LeBron would talk about it like this
[1:55:51] he'd say this is a wonderful sermon
[1:55:53] might be a good thing to go listen to
[1:55:55] during this season that we're coming to
[1:55:57] this is a time of seasons we focus our
[1:55:59] thinking towards Christmas
[1:56:01] he said it's too bad we have a lot of
[1:56:03] the myth called Santa Claus
[1:56:05] instead of the real Christmas that it
[1:56:07] was supposed to be
[1:56:09] many children of the land today no more
[1:56:11] nothing more than Christmas Means and a
[1:56:13] slate full of toys and some Mystic
[1:56:15] reindeer pouncing on the house
[1:56:17] and only later learned that this is a
[1:56:19] myth to even hurt their faith he said
[1:56:22] when it comes to know the true Christmas
[1:56:24] Story
[1:56:25] that it had nothing to do with reindeers
[1:56:28] or a man smoking a pipe and a fur coat
[1:56:31] around fur around his coat but it was
[1:56:33] about the birth of our blessed Lord
[1:56:35] Jesus
[1:56:37] and this most unusual to see how God
[1:56:39] worked in this manner because no other
[1:56:41] time would it have ever worked and all
[1:56:45] the history of the world
[1:56:48] did you hear that there was no other
[1:56:50] time that the birth would have worked
[1:56:53] like this then all the history of the
[1:56:56] world so the guide knows exactly what
[1:56:59] he's doing
[1:57:02] he knows exactly the times and the
[1:57:05] moments and the seasons and the right
[1:57:07] direct
[1:57:09] time
[1:57:11] it was a time that when Harry there was
[1:57:13] a murderer was key it had to be
[1:57:16] this heartless man had to be king and on
[1:57:20] the throne
[1:57:22] so we're acquainted with scriptures how
[1:57:24] he slew all the children from
[1:57:25] two-year-old down trying to kill the
[1:57:28] Christ
[1:57:29] it had to be just at that time then
[1:57:32] there had to be at that time there had
[1:57:33] to be a raise in taxation
[1:57:39] do you notice similarities that take
[1:57:41] place
[1:57:43] at every Exodus there was the killing of
[1:57:45] the of the children
[1:57:48] at every Exodus there was an increase of
[1:57:51] burdens
[1:57:53] you go make bricks without straw
[1:57:57] there's a taxation I need all of y'all I
[1:57:59] don't care who you are go to your home
[1:58:01] cities
[1:58:02] so it wasn't an easy thing they didn't
[1:58:04] have a GMC truck to jump in with air
[1:58:06] conditioning go down the road in a few
[1:58:07] minutes and be Israel's not that big
[1:58:09] just there not too many years ago and
[1:58:12] you could be on one end to the other and
[1:58:13] just seemed like maybe an hour an hour
[1:58:15] and a half
[1:58:16] it's not that big but on a donkey it's
[1:58:18] real big
[1:58:20] I was on a bus
[1:58:22] and I had a guide
[1:58:24] he knew the dangers
[1:58:26] he knew the situations he knew where he
[1:58:29] was supposed to be and where you wasn't
[1:58:30] supposed to be
[1:58:34] he had a connection that I didn't have
[1:58:37] because there were places that we
[1:58:39] thought you know that was that was on
[1:58:40] the program and we was going to go down
[1:58:42] the mountain where they found Mount
[1:58:43] Sinai now and they found the encampments
[1:58:45] they found stuff around it and and you
[1:58:47] know over there there's all kinds of
[1:58:50] things over there that that the Catholic
[1:58:52] Church camped on and said this is that
[1:58:54] and this that some of it may be true
[1:58:55] some of it may not be but there are
[1:58:57] certain places that are true and you
[1:58:59] know and they did a good thing in some
[1:59:00] sense because it wasn't destroyed they
[1:59:02] kept it
[1:59:04] so I mean God used it
[1:59:06] but you know they would they would say
[1:59:08] well this is where it was the baptism
[1:59:10] took place of of Jesus and it was it was
[1:59:12] actually miles and miles away from where
[1:59:14] it actually took place or where the
[1:59:16] crossing of the Jordan River because the
[1:59:17] Bible is a GPS our our brother that went
[1:59:20] with us the the guide he as well he said
[1:59:23] the Bible is always true and he actually
[1:59:26] took the Bible and found where the city
[1:59:29] what city was that it was by Jericho
[1:59:31] can't think of it right off but he found
[1:59:33] that City and he found right there where
[1:59:36] the crossing would have took place
[1:59:39] they actually had a celebration in
[1:59:40] Israel too and made a celebration
[1:59:42] invited him up and everything because of
[1:59:44] what he had found because he used the
[1:59:46] Bible to show him where it was at
[1:59:50] that's amazing ain't it
[1:59:52] well anyway well you know we thought we
[1:59:54] was going to go to Mount Sinai we
[1:59:56] actually sat down as a group and debated
[1:59:57] this that and the other and decided you
[1:59:59] know there was maybe dangers it was
[2:00:01] right down the Egyptian border and we
[2:00:02] had to get permission of the soldiers we
[2:00:04] had to get this hat and the other and
[2:00:06] you know during the night I went to bed
[2:00:07] that night thinking I was going to get
[2:00:09] on the bus the next morning and I'm
[2:00:10] headed straight down to Mount Sinai and
[2:00:13] I woke up the next morning I got my
[2:00:14] stuff together me and sister Ruth we put
[2:00:16] it on the bus we got up our seat and
[2:00:18] we're ready to go to Mount Sinai and the
[2:00:19] god gets on said well we're not going to
[2:00:21] Mount Sinai he said there's dangers down
[2:00:24] there that come up and we're not we not
[2:00:25] got permission he had connections that I
[2:00:28] didn't get a phone call that night
[2:00:30] I didn't get a text message that night
[2:00:32] but apparently somewhere between our
[2:00:35] meeting and the next morning on the bus
[2:00:36] he had got information it wasn't safe to
[2:00:39] go down that way no more
[2:00:41] and you know what I didn't sit there and
[2:00:43] say Mr God I want to go that way Mr God
[2:00:46] I'm determined to go that way no I felt
[2:00:48] like I could trust him
[2:00:50] he had been there before he knew the all
[2:00:53] the Dynamics that was going on around
[2:00:55] that country he had connections he had
[2:00:57] been there he had said he had taken
[2:00:59] people safely before but this was not a
[2:01:01] safe time to go so if it wasn't a safe
[2:01:04] time to go I didn't want to go
[2:01:07] and I was going to trust the god
[2:01:17] but we found similarities if you look
[2:01:20] death of babies
[2:01:24] higher increases
[2:01:29] people in leadership that doesn't know
[2:01:31] God
[2:01:37] first second third Exodus
[2:01:42] that God is trying to show us something
[2:01:46] let's don't get our eyes off the guide
[2:01:52] he said there had to be registered
[2:01:56] their births
[2:01:58] was on record of the courts and the
[2:02:00] temple and they had to be taxed
[2:02:05] he said well really what was this all
[2:02:07] about
[2:02:08] there was a word spoken that said he had
[2:02:11] to be born in Bethlehem
[2:02:13] so God was going to use whatever methods
[2:02:16] he had to use that God was going to pull
[2:02:18] whatever strings he had to pull to make
[2:02:21] his word be fulfilled
[2:02:24] and all of what we're seeing amen listen
[2:02:27] Russia in this place in the U.S and all
[2:02:29] that's going the God is in control
[2:02:33] don't get your eyes off of what's really
[2:02:35] going on we get our eyes on politics and
[2:02:37] this that and the other the Republicans
[2:02:39] has got this and the Democrats has got
[2:02:41] that and God's got it
[2:02:43] [Applause]
[2:02:46] Amen brother van will say he said
[2:02:48] politics he said I don't care what side
[2:02:50] it is it's all of the devil
[2:02:53] and so who's got the devil in his
[2:02:55] control
[2:02:57] who made him is the creation more
[2:03:01] powerful than the Creator
[2:03:07] he's pulling the strings
[2:03:09] he's getting the right person
[2:03:12] in the place
[2:03:13] to do what it takes to fulfill his word
[2:03:16] the God has got this
[2:03:22] we ought to be to rest this morning
[2:03:24] because we saw how he brought it all to
[2:03:26] pass in the first Exodus and now we're
[2:03:29] looking how he's bringing it to pass in
[2:03:31] the second for Exodus
[2:03:34] and it all worked
[2:03:38] hello
[2:03:39] not one of his words went unfulfilled
[2:03:42] they all everything that spoke of that
[2:03:44] time was fulfilled
[2:03:47] some of it was fulfilled in the last few
[2:03:49] minutes on the cross but it was
[2:03:51] fulfilled
[2:03:53] all the words spoke about this Exodus
[2:03:56] will be fulfilled
[2:04:01] it might be fulfilled in the last few
[2:04:04] moments
[2:04:11] he said notice they didn't have a nice
[2:04:13] great fine plush ambulance to take Mary
[2:04:15] there
[2:04:17] they didn't have that but it was a
[2:04:19] king's orders no excuses was good enough
[2:04:21] it must be fulfilled the king said no
[2:04:24] matter her conditions
[2:04:26] and she wasn't in the greatest condition
[2:04:29] she was right at the time of giving
[2:04:31] birth
[2:04:35] any husband in here
[2:04:37] knows
[2:04:39] if you ever want to get your wife on a
[2:04:41] donkey that ain't the time
[2:04:48] it's uncomfortable in a good car
[2:04:52] it seemed like God why are you putting
[2:04:54] us through this heartache
[2:04:56] why am I going through this
[2:04:58] so his word can be fulfilled
[2:05:01] so his word can be fulfilled why I'm
[2:05:05] honest donkey going across this
[2:05:06] Wilderness wise robbers there's this
[2:05:09] there's all kind of dangers there's
[2:05:10] every kind of thing around me why am I
[2:05:13] going so his word can be fulfilled
[2:05:16] why are we still here so his word can be
[2:05:19] fulfilled
[2:05:21] why am I going through what I'm going
[2:05:22] through so this word can be fulfilled
[2:05:29] foreign
[2:05:30] he's the god
[2:05:34] Mary expecting any time sitting on the
[2:05:36] back of a donkey
[2:05:38] if anybody ever wrote a donkey it's a
[2:05:40] rough ride
[2:05:42] little fella along a narrow Trail
[2:05:44] winding over the mountains listen it was
[2:05:46] a rough ride many times in a good and
[2:05:48] Plush Bus
[2:05:50] but over these little nail Trails winds
[2:05:52] blowing dust blowing
[2:05:55] rough rugged Road
[2:05:58] robbers
[2:06:01] taking good slaying people
[2:06:04] what a thing it was for this young
[2:06:05] married couple that they had to face
[2:06:08] God why are they having to go through
[2:06:10] that
[2:06:12] that his word might be fulfilled
[2:06:16] also what is some wild beasts would
[2:06:19] destroy them
[2:06:22] took that little party in an instant
[2:06:24] with some wild beast Joseph didn't have
[2:06:26] nothing but a stick
[2:06:27] his wife could hardly move
[2:06:30] but they had to face it
[2:06:34] he said but that gives us consolation
[2:06:37] to know this that we do not hold our
[2:06:41] destiny
[2:06:42] god holds our destiny and he has
[2:06:46] ordained it to be so and there is
[2:06:49] nothing that will ever interrupt the
[2:06:52] program of God
[2:06:54] that gives me something to shout about
[2:06:57] because Cancer Cannot interrupt it every
[2:07:00] kind of disease will not interrupted any
[2:07:03] kind of sin will not interrupt it family
[2:07:05] issues will not interrupt it but his
[2:07:08] word will be fulfilled
[2:07:22] he said oh we see this dark
[2:07:25] enveloping
[2:07:26] of time
[2:07:28] but God's great hand
[2:07:32] his guide is moving steadily on and
[2:07:35] nothing
[2:07:36] everybody say nothing nothing shall stop
[2:07:40] it
[2:07:42] Hallelujah is that I can see as they
[2:07:45] make that one last curve and they find
[2:07:47] them a good spot to maybe lay down a
[2:07:49] little bit
[2:07:50] and he said I see Joseph get the little
[2:07:52] Maps together and he said I see him try
[2:07:54] to find a few sticks to build a fire and
[2:07:57] they're looking over the Hillside and
[2:07:59] they can kind of see Bethlehem over
[2:08:01] across there maybe a few lights
[2:08:04] he said but all of a sudden as he's
[2:08:06] laying that mat down
[2:08:08] he said I see him look up a little
[2:08:10] higher
[2:08:12] and yes I see the stars starts twinkling
[2:08:16] and they start twinkling a little bit
[2:08:18] and brightening up
[2:08:19] and they begin to shine
[2:08:22] he said what was taking place
[2:08:24] God like this great Shining Light was
[2:08:28] beginning to shine out
[2:08:30] because he knew that two years down the
[2:08:33] road he would be a little child in the
[2:08:35] house
[2:08:36] and there would be some men that would
[2:08:39] come with gifts and there had to be
[2:08:41] something that would draw them to that
[2:08:42] place
[2:08:44] and he said why listen to the prophet of
[2:08:46] God he said why would they know that
[2:08:49] that light meant something he said
[2:08:51] because years before that Daniel was
[2:08:54] exiled down into that place
[2:08:57] and his life began to had such a
[2:09:00] testimony of a living God and he left
[2:09:03] behind Scrolls and he showed them what a
[2:09:06] really Living God was all about
[2:09:09] that's why Daniel had to go through the
[2:09:11] Lion's Den that's why the three huge
[2:09:13] review children had to go through the
[2:09:15] fire so God could fulfill his word
[2:09:22] it blows your mind when you think about
[2:09:25] all that God had to do to get he said
[2:09:29] now he said scripture doesn't say it but
[2:09:31] he said we look at it and we believe
[2:09:33] that three came because it was three
[2:09:35] gifts and he said normally they traveled
[2:09:37] in about three or four he said so we'll
[2:09:39] say three
[2:09:40] he said but to put all of that together
[2:09:45] that they would have something in their
[2:09:47] heart
[2:09:48] that they were looking for a sign
[2:09:52] he said because Daniel had spoken to
[2:09:55] them
[2:09:56] and he had told them that in the last
[2:09:58] days the people that know their God
[2:10:01] shall do exploits
[2:10:04] he had left them words and they had been
[2:10:06] studying those words they had been
[2:10:09] looking at those words and they had been
[2:10:11] diligently studying the bodies of the
[2:10:13] stars and watching for the sign
[2:10:19] he said if Christians would only do that
[2:10:22] not just watch the stars but what's
[2:10:25] God's word as it's unfolding
[2:10:29] if we would only notice it today and see
[2:10:31] how God has promised in this day the
[2:10:33] things that we so gallantly stand for
[2:10:35] God has promised to do the same and he's
[2:10:38] doing them
[2:10:39] he's Healing The Sick he's doing great
[2:10:41] miracles
[2:10:44] and the same Daniel that taught them of
[2:10:47] them events is the same God today that
[2:10:50] spoke through Daniel and said in the
[2:10:53] last days
[2:10:56] the people
[2:10:58] that know their God
[2:11:01] shall do exploits
[2:11:04] so if God could design it to where three
[2:11:07] wise men down hundreds of years later
[2:11:10] would still be looking for a star and he
[2:11:12] would put a word down there that
[2:11:14] hundreds of years there was still
[2:11:16] something pricking on them and looking
[2:11:18] and and wondering what is it going to
[2:11:20] take place and all of a sudden he said I
[2:11:22] can see one of them as he took that
[2:11:23] little scroll up to that Watch Tower and
[2:11:26] he laid it out and he looked up and up
[2:11:28] there became one became a great Shining
[2:11:30] Light as them Stars moved together
[2:11:33] he said I can see him become Spellbound
[2:11:36] that's the word brother Branham he used
[2:11:38] it several times he said Spellbound
[2:11:42] as he just watched it he said I've
[2:11:45] waited for it I've hold on for it but
[2:11:48] here it is
[2:11:50] here it is right here I waited for it
[2:11:52] I've longed for it I've looked for it
[2:11:55] and here it is
[2:11:57] here it is here it is and he said he got
[2:12:01] so excited he rolled his little scroll
[2:12:03] up and he took off down them stairs down
[2:12:06] to his buddy's house and he knocked on
[2:12:08] the door he said it's here
[2:12:10] it's here it's here here it is here it
[2:12:15] is here it is he's on all today if I
[2:12:18] could just you get you to realize he's
[2:12:20] here
[2:12:22] that same light is here here he is he's
[2:12:25] Among Us he's healing us he's delivering
[2:12:28] us oh God is there somebody that's
[2:12:30] spelled Bound by his presence
[2:12:33] that has caught their attention and
[2:12:36] they're not paying attention to nothing
[2:12:37] else
[2:12:41] he's here
[2:12:44] he said even notice God reveals himself
[2:12:46] to those who are searching and longing
[2:12:50] to see him
[2:12:52] draw an eye to me and I'll draw an eye
[2:12:54] unto you
[2:13:00] he said well what was going on he said
[2:13:02] why
[2:13:03] why did they catch it when it happened
[2:13:08] he said because I can see them
[2:13:15] mind let me back up a little bit
[2:13:24] foreign
[2:13:28] he said I can see them
[2:13:32] he said they were in a spiritual
[2:13:35] attitude
[2:13:38] they were looking for something he said
[2:13:41] they must have been singing some hymns
[2:13:43] or praying
[2:13:44] but whatever however
[2:13:46] they must have been in a spiritual
[2:13:48] attitude
[2:13:50] to receive it
[2:13:54] oh my so many good things here
[2:13:57] he said
[2:13:58] they watch The Heavenly lights but this
[2:14:01] light was different than the rest of
[2:14:03] them and he said today we've watched
[2:14:06] Methodist Baptist Pentecostal
[2:14:09] Presbyterian lights but to those who
[2:14:11] look for him
[2:14:13] there seems to be a different light
[2:14:14] that's Shining that's declaring him
[2:14:17] that's saying he's the same yesterday
[2:14:19] today and forever that he is with us
[2:14:22] that he is moving that he is moving
[2:14:24] Among Us he said oh they as they stood
[2:14:27] there Spellbound one could not speak to
[2:14:29] the other for the glory of this life had
[2:14:32] Spellbound them he said how is the day
[2:14:34] my poor decrepit friend that when the
[2:14:36] man who has never known his pie that
[2:14:38] when man who has never known his power
[2:14:40] to give new light New Hope when he walks
[2:14:43] into the presence of the Divine person
[2:14:45] of Christ with the faith that holds him
[2:14:48] Spellbound
[2:14:50] to his majesty
[2:14:52] it isn't like walking to the Altar and
[2:14:54] giving the ministers just another
[2:14:56] handshake but you're walking into the
[2:14:58] light that you've never witnessed before
[2:15:00] and it puts New Life in you it gives
[2:15:04] hope to those that are dying it gives
[2:15:06] courage to the weak it gives healing to
[2:15:08] the sick it gives blessing to the
[2:15:10] unfavored how wonderful it is to step
[2:15:13] into the light of his presence
[2:15:15] it's not a myth frizz
[2:15:19] truth
[2:15:25] another place he said those Magi stood
[2:15:27] Spellbound
[2:15:28] as they watch that light
[2:15:31] God was moving among them he said it's
[2:15:34] only for those who look for him
[2:15:36] that'll see him
[2:15:40] if you're not looking for him in this
[2:15:41] service you won't see him
[2:15:45] but if you are
[2:15:48] you will
[2:15:50] hallelujah it's only those who believe
[2:15:52] in him shall enjoy his blessings it's
[2:15:55] only to those who believe in healing
[2:15:56] that shall receive healing it's only
[2:15:58] those who believe in Salvation that
[2:16:00] obtain it it's only those who believe
[2:16:02] all things that are possible that'll see
[2:16:04] all things are possible
[2:16:10] we know the stories they would come
[2:16:13] and they would I ain't got time to go
[2:16:14] and do it all but they would come and
[2:16:16] they would find themselves in Jerusalem
[2:16:18] and when they went into to Jerusalem and
[2:16:21] went before Herod he said the light left
[2:16:23] them
[2:16:27] he said but when they came back out
[2:16:30] the light was still there
[2:16:32] Hallelujah you may have found yourself
[2:16:34] off the beaten path this morning but if
[2:16:37] you'll just come back out
[2:16:39] the light's still there
[2:16:41] the light's still given a testimony that
[2:16:44] the king is Among Us amen we could go
[2:16:46] into the gold and all the things that
[2:16:48] they gave him it's a wonderful wonderful
[2:16:50] thing but I want to get to something
[2:16:51] brother Brandon would bring it down he
[2:16:53] says you are a star
[2:17:02] you are a star
[2:17:04] every Christian is a star to guide the
[2:17:09] Lost
[2:17:11] to guide the weary
[2:17:13] the foot of the traveler to those who
[2:17:16] are seeking then the star cannot be
[2:17:19] guided by itself it must be led by the
[2:17:22] spirit it must reflect the brilliancy of
[2:17:25] God in his life to obtain it's abstain
[2:17:27] from those things of the world to live
[2:17:29] Godly and soberly in this present life
[2:17:31] it must reflect the light of the great
[2:17:35] one that has signed Among Us
[2:17:39] what are we to do then to rise
[2:17:42] and Shine the Light Of God to the dying
[2:17:46] world it's in depth darkness of the
[2:17:48] world we are to reflect and Shine the
[2:17:50] presence of the Lord Jesus in his
[2:17:52] resurrecting power as he is yesterday so
[2:17:57] he is today and so he will be tomorrow
[2:18:02] that's what God wants he wants a church
[2:18:05] that'll shine out and say God's still
[2:18:07] the same
[2:18:09] he still heals he's still saves he still
[2:18:13] delivers he's still sets free he still
[2:18:16] does it impossible he's still God
[2:18:22] foreign
[2:18:30] is going to keep shining
[2:18:33] skipping through all kinds of stuff
[2:18:34] because I got to get down to
[2:18:36] the moments of closing
[2:18:40] these wise men saw that the word of God
[2:18:42] said a star would rise out of Jacob
[2:18:45] they followed that little god-given
[2:18:47] token
[2:18:48] to the source of Eternal Light
[2:18:52] so will wise men today
[2:18:55] who's not blinded by creeds
[2:18:58] they will follow the god-given spoken
[2:19:01] word
[2:19:01] till they see the fullness
[2:19:04] of the power of God blooming in this
[2:19:07] hour
[2:19:08] no matter how many of observatories how
[2:19:10] many other things told the wise men
[2:19:12] while you're out of your mind
[2:19:13] two years they was in travel
[2:19:16] they passed by many nations and they'd
[2:19:18] ask where are you going we've seen his
[2:19:20] star
[2:19:21] and we're going to worship Him
[2:19:24] when they lined up in Jerusalem the
[2:19:26] nominational headquarters they didn't
[2:19:27] have the answer they went up and down
[2:19:28] the streets crying where is he born King
[2:19:31] of the Jews they know nothing about it
[2:19:33] they called on the word to find out they
[2:19:35] had followed know that the star was
[2:19:37] leading them to that eternal life God is
[2:19:39] to thy Perfect Light and the word is
[2:19:42] what guides you to the light and the
[2:19:44] light is what makes the word Vindicated
[2:19:48] notice they were wise men
[2:19:52] do we have any wise men among us today
[2:19:56] and wise men today all the wisdom of
[2:19:58] this world is foolishness to God all
[2:20:00] your scientists all your people
[2:20:01] depending on some great scholarship or
[2:20:03] something another telling you how to
[2:20:04] split an atom that won't give you life
[2:20:06] that'll give you death
[2:20:08] there's nothing can take you to life but
[2:20:11] the spoken word of God it's only where
[2:20:13] the life can come it's through a spoken
[2:20:15] word how know how to spit it Adam I wish
[2:20:17] they'd never found out how because it's
[2:20:19] going to burst this world up into pieces
[2:20:21] he said well the righteous will walk out
[2:20:24] on the dust of the wicked where sin will
[2:20:27] be forgotten everything has a way of
[2:20:28] renewing itself and man who's given to
[2:20:31] life on this Earth by his wisdom taking
[2:20:32] the tree of knowledge into the tree of
[2:20:34] life he'll destroy the Earth that God
[2:20:36] has given and live on but those who are
[2:20:38] still on the Tree of Life shall come to
[2:20:41] the new heavens and the new Earth where
[2:20:43] there's no sickness where there's no
[2:20:45] death there's nothing but light light
[2:20:47] light light light
[2:20:48] there's no darkness no more
[2:20:52] what a day that's going to be
[2:20:55] it was the angels of God that showed
[2:20:58] light upon a hill to some Shepherds to
[2:21:00] guide them to Eternal Light
[2:21:03] see it only comes by light life can only
[2:21:08] come by light
[2:21:11] so if you don't have the light you don't
[2:21:14] have the life
[2:21:21] well I got the word well the light
[2:21:23] follows the word and the word follows
[2:21:26] the light
[2:21:27] they go hand in hand
[2:21:29] you can't have one without the other
[2:21:33] amen
[2:21:35] because the light is to lead you into
[2:21:38] all truth
[2:21:40] we say well I got the Bible
[2:21:43] well so if they had it for two thousand
[2:21:44] years or however many years it has been
[2:21:46] they've had Scrolls and but then they
[2:21:48] finally printed it what three or four
[2:21:50] hundred six hundred years ago
[2:21:53] so the Bible they had the Bible for 600
[2:21:55] years but they still believed in three
[2:21:57] gods
[2:21:58] they still had the wrong baptism
[2:22:01] they still snaught never saw the the
[2:22:04] trail of the serpent
[2:22:07] why because there wasn't enough light
[2:22:11] but when light began to shine
[2:22:15] the light of this world began to shine
[2:22:17] upon this word
[2:22:18] out of it
[2:22:20] and begin to open the seals
[2:22:22] been to show who all the horses were
[2:22:25] showed who all the spirits of God were
[2:22:28] and how they were working oh well
[2:22:29] they're the trail of the serpent is
[2:22:31] let's follow him see him go right down
[2:22:34] to the Garden all the way down see him
[2:22:36] move all the way through he saw it Cain
[2:22:38] and he saw it look look at his Trail all
[2:22:41] the way down all the way down to June he
[2:22:43] says
[2:22:45] Kane
[2:22:46] who was of that Wicked one
[2:22:49] what
[2:22:51] what happened light shining
[2:22:55] they had read that for years
[2:23:01] what was shining to show that there was
[2:23:04] a two-year-old little boy
[2:23:07] is it light
[2:23:09] there was many other maybe two-year-old
[2:23:11] little boys
[2:23:14] a lot of them got killed
[2:23:17] [Music]
[2:23:19] why was he there because there was a
[2:23:22] light that came to us the Father Joseph
[2:23:24] said get up and go to Egypt
[2:23:27] and it guided him to Egypt and it stayed
[2:23:29] there for two years and it guided him
[2:23:31] right back
[2:23:34] this God's been in business a long time
[2:23:38] now I want you to understand something
[2:23:40] when I want to go catch me a good fish
[2:23:44] and I don't know how to fish there I
[2:23:46] don't want just any God
[2:23:48] I want one that knows how to catch fish
[2:23:53] we remember Tim took a trip here back in
[2:23:55] May and we was over in the mountains
[2:23:57] there in British Columbia and revel
[2:23:58] Stoke Brother Sam Ray and his wife had
[2:24:01] had just
[2:24:03] kind of poured some blessings upon us
[2:24:05] and gave us a little spot to stay in and
[2:24:07] they they've set us up a guide and
[2:24:10] listen sister Rebecca had searched it
[2:24:13] out
[2:24:13] she told me she said I want you to have
[2:24:15] a good spot and I wanted you to have a
[2:24:17] good guide
[2:24:19] he said because I want you to catch fish
[2:24:21] I don't want you to just have a good
[2:24:23] time I want you to catch fish so I
[2:24:24] searched him out and I looked at reviews
[2:24:26] and I looked at the I found somebody
[2:24:28] that knew what they were doing
[2:24:32] and listen it was a hard day of fishing
[2:24:34] it wasn't but there was many that pulled
[2:24:36] up that Dock and they didn't have no
[2:24:38] fish on their boat but we did
[2:24:41] and it wasn't because I knew what lure
[2:24:43] to use it wasn't because I knew what
[2:24:45] depth it had to go it was fishing like I
[2:24:47] had never done before I'd never used the
[2:24:49] things the equipment that he had used I
[2:24:51] never but he had and he told me he said
[2:24:53] you know people think this is a big easy
[2:24:55] job you just kick back and relax he said
[2:24:57] I can't tell you how many hours I spend
[2:25:00] spending my own gas and spending my own
[2:25:02] time trying to find these fish and
[2:25:04] trying to find what's what they're
[2:25:05] eating what they're biting where they're
[2:25:06] at what's going on he said because I
[2:25:08] want my customers not to just come out
[2:25:11] and enjoy the mountains and enjoy the
[2:25:12] scenery I want them to catch fish
[2:25:14] because that's what I'm a guy I ain't a
[2:25:16] guy to show them the water I ain't a guy
[2:25:18] to show them all the scenery around them
[2:25:20] I am a guy just show them where the fish
[2:25:23] are at
[2:25:25] Hallelujah he was a God that knew what
[2:25:28] he was doing
[2:25:31] I don't know you won't don't want to
[2:25:33] depend on something that hasn't been
[2:25:35] proven
[2:25:37] amen you said well I'm going to depend
[2:25:39] on myself self is not proven what it's
[2:25:42] proven to do is to die and to go down to
[2:25:45] hell but there is a God
[2:25:47] there is a light that can guide you into
[2:25:51] eternal life
[2:25:53] he knows what he's going he's got a
[2:25:56] place prepared
[2:25:58] he's been there working on it and when
[2:26:01] you didn't see him working he was still
[2:26:04] working well you didn't see him moving
[2:26:06] he was still moving
[2:26:09] Hallelujah this God knows what he's
[2:26:12] doing you can trust Jesus
[2:26:18] oh yeah he'll not leave you in the
[2:26:20] darkness he'll not leave you in your
[2:26:22] sickness he'll not leave you in your
[2:26:24] trouble but he'll just grab a hold of
[2:26:26] your hand and say come on child we're
[2:26:28] going through this thing
[2:26:34] Hallelujah there is a God who can handle
[2:26:37] every situation
[2:26:40] he's battle tested
[2:26:47] Hallelujah we can just stand
[2:26:53] the Angels were lights
[2:26:56] that showed what the word of God was
[2:26:58] doing
[2:26:59] today in the city of David and Bethlehem
[2:27:01] was born Christ the Savior the Angels
[2:27:04] had the word
[2:27:05] but the word came by light
[2:27:08] to God
[2:27:10] they follow the words of the Angel to
[2:27:13] eternal light and they found a baby
[2:27:15] wrapped in swallowing cloth
[2:27:17] and they had said for you shall see life
[2:27:21] only comes by light
[2:27:27] Hallelujah
[2:27:33] we could go all through the scriptures
[2:27:36] if I'll bring it down to this last
[2:27:39] moment
[2:27:42] the god

[2:30:06] and he's here to turn on the light
[2:30:10] he knows how to flip the switch
[2:30:13] or can we say it like this flip the
[2:30:15] script
[2:30:17] you can be one moment walking in
[2:30:19] darkness and walk and next moment
[2:30:21] walking in light
[2:30:23] you can be coming this morning with
[2:30:25] depression and the man flipped the
[2:30:27] switch and you can walk out Siegen and
[2:30:29] Shout the Praises of almighty God
[2:30:32] Hallelujah you can walk out of here with
[2:30:35] every kind of suicide Spirit lay it upon
[2:30:37] you and the next moment a flip the
[2:30:40] switch is flipped
[2:30:43] it says devil get your hand off of my
[2:30:46] child
[2:30:49] and light began to shine and expose him
[2:30:56] there is a man
[2:30:58] that can turn on any light
[2:31:02] he's Jehovah Jireh there's a man the
[2:31:05] Holy Spirit he can turn on all the
[2:31:07] lights
[2:31:09] he is the word a man that can turn on
[2:31:11] the lights I don't know how you'd do it
[2:31:13] it's not for me to know how he's going
[2:31:15] to do it I know that he's going to turn
[2:31:18] it on
[2:31:19] Hallelujah well how's it going to turn
[2:31:21] it from this dark day of Leo to seal
[2:31:24] into a brand new life into a Rapture
[2:31:27] into a moment I don't know how
[2:31:30] but one day the children of Israel woke
[2:31:32] up slaves and by that evening they were
[2:31:35] walking out carrying the loads of Egypt
[2:31:38] and they were walking out shouting the
[2:31:40] victory I know one day they were
[2:31:41] standing by the Red Sea and the next
[2:31:43] moment it was a gap miles wide that they
[2:31:46] could walk across 5 000 wide I know if
[2:31:49] he did it there he can do it now
[2:31:52] Hallelujah I don't know I know one day
[2:31:55] there was a man that was down in the
[2:31:57] Lion's Den and the lions were trying but
[2:31:59] a man flipped a switch
[2:32:01] and there was light and then lines
[2:32:04] didn't look at him as a Divine to be
[2:32:05] divine no more they looked at Daniel as
[2:32:07] a place of comfort
[2:32:11] it was um three men that were in a fire
[2:32:16] and God flipped the switch
[2:32:19] and the fire that was meant to destroy
[2:32:22] them
[2:32:22] they were standing around walking and
[2:32:25] talking
[2:32:29] somebody flipped the switch
[2:32:31] how many's ever stuck their hand or been
[2:32:33] burnt by fire it hurts
[2:32:35] we're not talking about a little
[2:32:37] campfire here we're talking about a
[2:32:39] consuming fire heated up seven times
[2:32:42] hotter to try to destroy them and the
[2:32:45] next thing you know they got their hands
[2:32:47] in their pockets or they got their hands
[2:32:49] raised whatever and they're
[2:32:51] fellowshipping with a Fourth Man
[2:32:54] there's a man who knows how to flip that
[2:32:57] switch
[2:32:58] follow the guide
[2:33:00] he's got the switch
