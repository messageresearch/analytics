[28:57] he's the same yesterday today and
[28:59] forever
[29:01] amen
[29:02] this morning i bring you greetings
[29:05] amen from japan
[29:07] we was with them
[29:09] last night for service or ministered to
[29:12] them here in the office on a zoom
[29:14] meeting
[29:15] and
[29:17] was able to speak to them
[29:18] their sunday morning service
[29:21] and spoke to them on jesus christ the
[29:24] same yesterday today and forever
[29:26] that we're a continuation of the book of
[29:28] acts
[29:30] and i believe god is continuing his work
[29:32] right there in japan
[29:33] they're going out and they're doing
[29:35] mission work and reaching to far out
[29:37] places from their local assembly they're
[29:40] able to meet every sunday they're
[29:41] together and
[29:43] god's blessed them with different ones
[29:44] who can can operate
[29:47] technology and things so we can do
[29:49] something like this
[29:51] so we had a wonderful time with him last
[29:53] night and they of course send their
[29:54] greetings to you today amen they listen
[29:57] in all the time
[29:59] and they listen to every service and so
[30:03] we're there more than what we think
[30:06] but one one day maybe lord willing we
[30:08] can go back again we are looking to help
[30:11] brother danny del mundo to go and spend
[30:13] a couple of weeks there and
[30:15] and uh minister to them and do some work
[30:18] in the outlying areas as well so just be
[30:22] praying about that
[30:23] be happening sometime maybe this year
[30:26] coming up very soon japan's still
[30:28] pretty closed in a lot of ways as far as
[30:31] their coveted restrictions and things
[30:33] and and so we're just
[30:34] asking the lord to open the way where
[30:37] there seems to be no way because i mean
[30:39] governments think they're in control but
[30:41] they're not in control
[30:42] because if there's still a seed of god
[30:44] there and i believe there is
[30:46] god a tear down the walls
[30:48] whatever he has to do to go to them and
[30:50] to
[30:51] minister them and to lift them up and
[30:54] and brother fed there the pastor is
[30:56] doing a wonderful job and appreciate
[30:58] that god placed somebody like that there
[31:01] during this time especially when when we
[31:03] could not go and could not be apart but
[31:06] uh
[31:07] amen they're thriving they're moving
[31:09] forward and we're thankful for that
[31:11] amen so today we don't have any written
[31:14] prayer requests but i know there's a lot
[31:15] of needs here in our local assembly
[31:17] he may want to continue to remember
[31:19] healing for different ones sister ruth
[31:22] and sister nancy herron back there and
[31:25] amen our elderly among us
[31:27] and all of us we need a touch from god
[31:29] this morning
[31:31] i want to really ask again for prayer
[31:33] for brother ron he's been really sick in
[31:36] the last few days i understand and
[31:38] having a test coming up this week
[31:41] just we know that the end of this thing
[31:43] is coming very soon
[31:45] and so we're just
[31:46] looking to see god move in a very
[31:49] miraculous way for his on his behalf
[31:52] and healing to be completed in his body
[31:55] i mean how many believes that this
[31:56] morning

[32:28] ask the lord to
[32:30] minister to our hearts how many would
[32:32] say lord come by my way today
[32:34] i need a special touch
[32:37] you want that special touch
[32:39] then reach out and touch the hem of his
[32:40] garment as he passes by and i believe
[32:43] it'll be an action to cause a reaction

[32:48] morning to reach out and touch heaven

[1:08:02] you know i can remember karen and i
[1:08:04] flying into phoenix and and then you
[1:08:07] know they were an older couple in in the
[1:08:09] big busy city of phoenix i said now
[1:08:12] karen i said after we get off this plane
[1:08:15] here we're going to embark on the most
[1:08:17] dangerous part of our journey
[1:08:19] riding with bob king in phoenix
[1:08:23] he was a country boy and it didn't
[1:08:25] belong in the city
[1:08:27] but anyway um you know we we had
[1:08:29] wonderful times together i remember the
[1:08:32] time and brother bob just passed on just
[1:08:34] a little bit ago and one of his last
[1:08:37] things he was doing was i was listening
[1:08:39] to one of the sermons that i preached
[1:08:41] here and and
[1:08:43] you know just relishing in the presence
[1:08:45] of god
[1:08:46] and i remember as we crossed the
[1:08:49] mountains between um tucson and and
[1:08:54] phoenix and we were listening to the
[1:08:56] sermon things that are to be
[1:08:58] and uh
[1:09:00] brother branham said something about
[1:09:01] those uh that those homes that we're
[1:09:04] going to go to those
[1:09:06] um those palaces we have he said some
[1:09:09] are black-headed and brown-headed and
[1:09:10] blue-eyed and brown-eyed and
[1:09:13] those are mansions
[1:09:14] and i stopped the tape and i said
[1:09:17] brother king i said did you hear what
[1:09:19] was said he said well yeah no what what
[1:09:21] are you talking about and i said well i
[1:09:24] said he said when we go over there our
[1:09:26] mansions are going to be
[1:09:28] black-headed and brown-eyed and
[1:09:29] blue-eyed and
[1:09:31] why he sure did i've listened to this
[1:09:33] tape i don't know how many times and
[1:09:35] i've never heard that before
[1:09:38] that's amazing i said well you know and
[1:09:41] he was kind of following a little doctor
[1:09:42] in the
[1:09:44] return ministry at the time and kind of
[1:09:46] had all his eggs in that basket and i
[1:09:48] said well
[1:09:49] you know there's a lot of things you
[1:09:51] hadn't been hearing on those tapes
[1:09:53] and so
[1:09:54] that just gave me an opportunity and
[1:09:57] right there
[1:09:58] on that mountain drive the lights just
[1:10:01] came on and revelation struck his heart
[1:10:05] and and there was a great change that
[1:10:07] happened for him and for the church
[1:10:09] there in phoenix and
[1:10:11] and uh then on for his family
[1:10:14] and today i feel a part
[1:10:17] of this great heritage and
[1:10:19] and and a part of your life western and
[1:10:22] uh certainly a part of yours mariah amen
[1:10:25] you are you know such a blessing to us a

[1:12:16] with love
[1:12:18] let's stand together now
[1:12:20] [Music]
[1:12:21] you'll turn with me to romans chapter 4
[1:12:24] we'll read from the 16th verse
[1:12:26] we want to say thank you to our
[1:12:28] musicians and
[1:12:30] to all of you that
[1:12:31] make the worship part of the service
[1:12:34] the the blessing that it is thank you
[1:12:36] very much
[1:12:37] romans 4 and verse 16
[1:12:41] therefore it is of faith that it might
[1:12:43] be by grace
[1:12:45] to the end the promise might be sure to
[1:12:48] all the seed notice this all the seed
[1:12:51] not to that only which is of the law
[1:12:54] that is of the jewish law and the jews
[1:12:57] but to all but to that also which is of
[1:13:00] the faith of abraham who is the father
[1:13:03] of us all now he's speaking to the
[1:13:06] romans here and they are gentiles and he
[1:13:10] credits is now
[1:13:12] abraham being their father
[1:13:14] and he says that is written i have made
[1:13:17] thee a father of many nations before
[1:13:19] whom before him whom he believed even
[1:13:22] god who quickeneth the dead and call it
[1:13:25] those things which be not as though they
[1:13:28] were
[1:13:29] who against hope believed in hope that
[1:13:31] he might become the father of many
[1:13:33] nations according to that which was
[1:13:35] spoken
[1:13:36] so shall thy seed be
[1:13:39] and being not weak in faith he
[1:13:41] considered not his own body now dead
[1:13:44] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:13:46] neither the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:13:49] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:13:52] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:13:55] giving glory to god
[1:13:57] and being fully persuaded that what he
[1:14:00] had promised he was able also to perform
[1:14:05] therefore he was imputed to him for
[1:14:08] righteousness
[1:14:09] and the hebrews chapter 11 verse 11
[1:14:12] through faith also sarah herself
[1:14:14] received strength to conceive seed and
[1:14:17] was delivered of a child when she was
[1:14:20] past age because she judged him faithful
[1:14:23] who had promised
[1:14:24] therefore sprang there even of one and
[1:14:27] him as good as dead
[1:14:29] so many as the stars of the sky and
[1:14:32] multitude and as the sand which is by
[1:14:35] the seashore
[1:14:37] innumerable amen god bless you can be
[1:14:40] seated now this morning we're going to
[1:14:43] be speaking again concerning el shaddai
[1:14:47] and we're going to be speaking on of
[1:14:50] on there of filling
[1:14:52] every fiber
[1:14:54] you'll see where we're going here in a
[1:14:57] little bit but um as we're just making
[1:15:00] some uh background to this
[1:15:03] if you notice that doubt and unbelief
[1:15:07] and of course it's um offspring which is
[1:15:09] fear they are no benefit
[1:15:12] for all unbelief is sin
[1:15:15] and but when but faith is imputed to you
[1:15:18] for righteousness when we believe
[1:15:21] god imputes that to you as righteousness
[1:15:26] and so it puts actually puts
[1:15:28] righteousness in your account
[1:15:31] and so paul proclaims that it is a faith
[1:15:34] and not of works or something you
[1:15:36] merited
[1:15:38] and received a reward for doing
[1:15:40] something good
[1:15:42] but
[1:15:42] so that it would be of grace to all his
[1:15:45] seeds so it wasn't and keeping the law
[1:15:48] and you get merits for
[1:15:50] ken for how well you kept the law but it
[1:15:53] was of faith that it might be by grace
[1:15:57] to all of his seed and verse 16 declared
[1:16:01] that abraham is the father of us all
[1:16:05] verse 17 says as it is written i have
[1:16:08] made you a father of many nations
[1:16:12] in the presence of him whom he believed
[1:16:15] god who gives life to the dead and calls
[1:16:17] those things that do not exist as though
[1:16:21] they did
[1:16:22] now this was el shaddai almighty god
[1:16:25] given life to the dead
[1:16:27] who
[1:16:28] and who calls
[1:16:29] things that do not exist as already as
[1:16:33] though they already did
[1:16:36] and so even right now if you're looking
[1:16:38] at it god looks at everything is done
[1:16:42] it is finished
[1:16:44] so your healing is finished your
[1:16:46] salvation is finished
[1:16:49] everything has been provided for you and
[1:16:51] god calls it it's already done
[1:16:55] amen and so he acts as though it already
[1:16:58] exists in time because for him it's
[1:17:01] already settled
[1:17:04] and and that is true he called for light
[1:17:06] and of course light did not exist but he
[1:17:09] called it as though it did and light
[1:17:12] came
[1:17:13] and he called abraham the father of many
[1:17:15] nations before those nations existed and
[1:17:19] this was the point that that um
[1:17:22] paul was making here that that
[1:17:25] abraham was called our father father of
[1:17:28] many nations
[1:17:29] before we even were existing
[1:17:32] but you see that's god he calls those
[1:17:35] things which do not exist as though they
[1:17:37] already did
[1:17:39] and that's why you can say i am healed
[1:17:43] before it even happens
[1:17:45] you say well i need some evidence of my
[1:17:48] healing faith is the evidence
[1:17:52] of what you are not seeing
[1:17:54] you may not see it but your faith is the
[1:17:57] evidence of that healing
[1:18:00] you need no other evidence but faith
[1:18:04] now and of course when hope is gone you
[1:18:07] still believe
[1:18:09] so he said be not weak in faith he
[1:18:11] considered not his own body now dead
[1:18:15] this is verse 19. when he was about a
[1:18:17] hundred years old neither the deadness
[1:18:20] of sarah's wombs if you notice this he
[1:18:22] was not weak in faith and the reason and
[1:18:25] and not being weak in faith his faith
[1:18:27] would not consider his body that was
[1:18:30] dead
[1:18:31] or the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:18:34] faith does not consider
[1:18:37] that that negative
[1:18:38] faith only considers what god has done
[1:18:43] amen at calvary he finished it once and
[1:18:46] for all your healing was provided for
[1:18:50] your salvation was provided for your
[1:18:53] children was provided for
[1:18:55] everything you have need of was provided
[1:18:58] for and we need no other evidence than
[1:19:02] faith we believe it and when we believe
[1:19:05] it god declares that's righteous
[1:19:08] [Applause]
[1:19:12] so you want to be righteous with god you
[1:19:14] got to believe him
[1:19:16] this is what makes you righteous with
[1:19:18] god is by believing him he staggered not
[1:19:22] at the promise of god through unbelief
[1:19:25] now the promise was staggering
[1:19:29] let me just say it again it was
[1:19:30] staggering to think a 99 year old man is
[1:19:33] going to have a child a woman that
[1:19:35] hadn't had a child since she was a young
[1:19:38] girl and had this problem all her life
[1:19:41] and now she's 90 years old and and the
[1:19:43] whole promise was staggering
[1:19:48] amen i want you to understand you see
[1:19:51] the promises of god are always
[1:19:53] staggering they're beyond the mind
[1:19:56] they're beyond the ability of reasoning
[1:19:59] they are young beyond the ability of the
[1:20:02] flesh
[1:20:03] amen but they're not beyond the ability
[1:20:06] of your faith but being strong
[1:20:09] in faith he gave glory to god
[1:20:13] hallelujah you see he was already
[1:20:15] declaring it as though it was when he
[1:20:18] didn't even see it as yet
[1:20:21] amen if you want to be righteous with
[1:20:24] god that's what you have to do you have
[1:20:26] to declare it already i am
[1:20:29] i am sinless i am blood wasp i am a
[1:20:33] child of god i am the rapture under the
[1:20:37] resurrection life lives on the inside of
[1:20:40] me i am healed i am delivered i am free
[1:20:49] and when you declare what god says
[1:20:53] that's righteousness
[1:20:56] now he staggered not at the promise of
[1:20:59] the god through unbelief but was strong
[1:21:00] in faith given glory to god
[1:21:02] and being fully persuaded
[1:21:07] amen that what he had promised
[1:21:10] god was able to perform it now abraham
[1:21:13] didn't say now i can make this happen
[1:21:18] abraham didn't say i can do this
[1:21:21] he said he was fully persuaded that what
[1:21:24] else shall i almighty god had promised
[1:21:28] he was able to do it
[1:21:32] amen so how did abraham do that when
[1:21:34] there was no hope for it happened he did
[1:21:37] it by giving glory to god and being
[1:21:39] fully persuaded that what god had
[1:21:42] promised god was able to perform it so
[1:21:44] he did it by dwelling on the promise
[1:21:48] and god's ability
[1:21:50] and consider not his body now dead
[1:21:53] neither yet the
[1:21:55] deadness of sarah's womb and sarah did
[1:21:58] the same she simply
[1:22:00] judged
[1:22:01] that god was faithful who made the
[1:22:04] promise
[1:22:06] amen well you know i'm 90 years old but
[1:22:09] god's faithful
[1:22:10] abraham is 99 years old but god is
[1:22:13] faithful this has never happened before
[1:22:16] in all recorded history but god is
[1:22:18] faithful what he promised he is able to
[1:22:21] perform it
[1:22:23] we've got to believe that for our body
[1:22:25] change we got to believe it for every
[1:22:27] promise of god for the rapture come on
[1:22:30] we've got to believe that what god
[1:22:32] promised
[1:22:33] he is able to do it
[1:22:38] now this is where she receives strength
[1:22:43] by judging him faithful
[1:22:46] by looking at his word and saying it's
[1:22:49] true
[1:22:50] and you know i can't i'm not looking at
[1:22:52] my symptoms if i look at that i'll
[1:22:54] stagger
[1:22:56] but i'm looking over here at my god
[1:22:59] and my god's the almighty god
[1:23:02] and my god is faithful
[1:23:05] whatever he said he's faithful
[1:23:07] he will perform it
[1:23:09] now as we have been through it god
[1:23:12] appeared to abraham at the age of 99
[1:23:15] genesis 17 1 when abram was
[1:23:19] the lord appeared to abram and said unto
[1:23:22] him i am the almighty god walk before me
[1:23:26] and be thou perfect so here he
[1:23:28] introduces self as the almighty god or
[1:23:32] el said i
[1:23:34] in the hebrew itself said i meaning the
[1:23:36] breasted god
[1:23:39] and this is or this represents or types
[1:23:43] out
[1:23:44] the holy ghost from whom we drink life
[1:23:47] from
[1:23:49] where where was abraham going to get
[1:23:52] strength from what the almighty god had
[1:23:55] said
[1:23:56] he was going to draw his strength from
[1:23:59] el shaddai he met with me
[1:24:02] he stood in my midst i had a personal
[1:24:05] experience with him he provided for me
[1:24:09] and gave me a promise and i'm going to
[1:24:12] believe what that promise said
[1:24:14] even though i don't have no hope i'm
[1:24:17] going to believe
[1:24:19] in hope
[1:24:21] amen i'm going to start believing in the
[1:24:23] hulk i'm going to we're going to bring
[1:24:25] forth a child
[1:24:27] now else said i was bringing a message
[1:24:29] full of promises
[1:24:31] and that's the message that we have
[1:24:33] received from god in our generation
[1:24:37] and it was given to us to nurse on until
[1:24:40] the body changed
[1:24:42] the the holy ghost says elsa died that
[1:24:44] we are to drink in
[1:24:47] with refreshing after refreshing
[1:24:51] notice again they received strength they
[1:24:54] were refreshed
[1:24:57] from el shaddai
[1:24:59] on the promises of el shaddai this is
[1:25:02] where they got their strength from
[1:25:05] they did not give their strength on by
[1:25:07] considering their body now dead or the
[1:25:10] deadness that serves when you won't get
[1:25:12] strength from considering
[1:25:16] what the doctor said
[1:25:19] amen what the symptoms are
[1:25:21] you're not going to get strength from
[1:25:23] that you'll get depressed you'll be
[1:25:25] getting worried
[1:25:27] you get fearful you become afraid but
[1:25:30] when you consider what god said and that
[1:25:33] he is able
[1:25:35] [Applause]
[1:25:39] now
[1:25:40] again at this junction
[1:25:43] it is a junction that we must constantly
[1:25:46] receive of the holy ghost
[1:25:49] a constant continual renewing
[1:25:53] a constant nursing from el shaddai
[1:25:57] now more than ever before it is why it
[1:26:01] is why so many are dead without life
[1:26:04] they aren't nursing daily
[1:26:06] remember to re if you just walk if you
[1:26:10] don't walk with jesus every day you're
[1:26:12] just taking on a denominational life
[1:26:17] that's all it is organizational life
[1:26:20] you're just a denominational believer
[1:26:22] you might come to a message church
[1:26:24] but you'll act like the baptist or the
[1:26:26] methodist or presbyterian just have an
[1:26:29] organizational life
[1:26:31] amen when you when you there
[1:26:35] to have a life worthy of the gospel you
[1:26:37] must follow jesus every day
[1:26:41] is that right
[1:26:42] now you see
[1:26:44] nursing daily it comes in many forms
[1:26:46] with lots of nutrients
[1:26:49] amen we got we got far more vitamins
[1:26:52] than what abraham had
[1:26:54] come on we got a whole bible full
[1:26:57] we got a lot more examples than what
[1:26:59] abraham said we got types and shadows
[1:27:02] throughout all the bible from the old
[1:27:05] through the new testament from genesis
[1:27:07] to revelation
[1:27:09] amen so again you know we we we have
[1:27:12] plenty of nutrients
[1:27:15] amen el shaddai gives life through
[1:27:18] prayer meetings
[1:27:20] through altar calls through prayer lines
[1:27:24] through reading his word
[1:27:26] hearing his word fellowshipping with the
[1:27:29] saints
[1:27:30] singing and worship the family altar at
[1:27:33] home at work or while driving down the
[1:27:36] road or when trying when praying in the
[1:27:38] spirit
[1:27:40] amen or
[1:27:42] or you know you turn on the tape
[1:27:44] there's no limit
[1:27:47] i want you to understand there's no
[1:27:49] limit
[1:27:50] he wants to pour himself into us
[1:27:54] and now in this age there are more ways
[1:27:57] to nurse from him than ever before
[1:28:01] amen we've got to avail ourselves of
[1:28:03] every chance
[1:28:05] of every opportunity of every channel
[1:28:08] that he gives us
[1:28:11] come on now
[1:28:13] god gave us gadgets brother branham said
[1:28:16] to and it recorded his voice
[1:28:19] amen gave us 1100 tapes
[1:28:22] i mean your phone is more than for
[1:28:24] social media
[1:28:26] and to keep up with the news
[1:28:28] there's the bible that you can listen to
[1:28:31] and read there's a message you can
[1:28:33] listen to and read there's a five-fold
[1:28:36] ministry around the world that is
[1:28:37] ministering
[1:28:40] life encouragement strength and you've
[1:28:44] got to avail yourself of every channel
[1:28:47] that he gives us
[1:28:49] this is why we will be at the church
[1:28:52] every time the door is open
[1:28:55] amen we're not denominational christians
[1:28:58] who comes and sporadically you know and
[1:29:01] are there sometime or you know here on

[1:29:21] act like baptists on wednesday night and
[1:29:23] don't show up till sunday and miss half
[1:29:25] of them
[1:29:26] we're not denominational christians we
[1:29:30] don't have an organizational life we
[1:29:33] have a bright life because we are in
[1:29:36] bright time with a love affair between
[1:29:39] us and the bridegroom
[1:29:44] this is why that we will sacrifice jobs
[1:29:47] to go to to travel to special meetings
[1:29:49] with believers
[1:29:51] this is why we have prayer meetings and
[1:29:53] bible studies and family altered home
[1:29:56] and more than ever before we must be
[1:29:58] connected

[1:31:27] a while
[1:31:29] it's not a sip of the holy ghost and
[1:31:31] it's just a special meeting and then we
[1:31:33] go through drought times the rest of the
[1:31:35] time

[1:34:00] confirmed so he gave him his own name
[1:34:03] abraham
[1:34:04] when he did that the next thing after he
[1:34:06] did after he give him that name placed
[1:34:10] out on his name what'd he do he gave him
[1:34:12] a sign
[1:34:13] that he was absolutely ready to
[1:34:16] absolutely destroy all sin
[1:34:18] that was around him and i want you to
[1:34:20] listen to his words and positionally put
[1:34:23] his body in condition to receive the

[1:35:57] ghost comes without feeling or without
[1:35:59] knowing it here's how brother branham
[1:36:02] demonstrated this in the easter seal he
[1:36:04] said you are quickened this is 1965
[1:36:08] just months before he would leave and he
[1:36:10] said this quickening power brings your
[1:36:13] body into a raptured condition already
[1:36:19] your body
[1:36:21] gets in a raptured condition
[1:36:24] hallelujah
[1:36:25] amen what do you think that is happening

[1:36:38] raptured condition
[1:36:42] hallelujah it's a quickening up
[1:36:45] it's a life-giving power
[1:36:47] what's what he said already notice the
[1:36:50] pentecostal people up there they got
[1:36:52] quickened by the holy spirit listen to
[1:36:55] me when those pentecostal group up there
[1:36:57] on the day of pentecost receive their
[1:36:59] abstract deed from god sure it glorified
[1:37:03] their souls oh it glorified their souls
[1:37:06] brother tim you're you're missing it
[1:37:07] listen he said sure it glorified their
[1:37:11] soul they screamed
[1:37:13] they saw tongues of fire separated upon
[1:37:16] them and it so quickened their body till
[1:37:20] they couldn't even speak in an earthly
[1:37:22] language anymore it quickened their body
[1:37:26] to a heavenly language the place that
[1:37:30] they're going to
[1:37:33] hallelujah
[1:37:34] quickening power of god shook their
[1:37:38] mortal bodies
[1:37:39] so their entire mortal language was
[1:37:43] transfigured
[1:37:46] mortal language transfigured transformed
[1:37:49] into an immortal language what a
[1:37:52] quickening power
[1:37:54] if the spirit that raised up jesus from
[1:37:57] the dead dwells in your mortal body it
[1:37:59] shall also quicken your mortal bodies we
[1:38:02] are quickened them by the power of the
[1:38:04] living god

[1:38:09] language to speak to them a rapturing up
[1:38:14] listen a rapturing up raising them up
[1:38:18] into a different atmosphere than they
[1:38:20] ever lived in
[1:38:22] what in the world you think is happening
[1:38:24] with a man or a woman that gets touched
[1:38:27] by the power of god and they react to it
[1:38:30] and they run or scream or shout amen
[1:38:33] hallelujah
[1:38:35] or if there's nothing but just like
[1:38:36] hattie wright said it's nothing but the
[1:38:39] truth
[1:38:40] amen whatever it was and what happened
[1:38:43] was you see it quickened them
[1:38:46] listen ray's rapturing up

[1:38:59] also with the new quickening life to
[1:39:01] them that came in on them that could

[1:39:06] language they spoke with new tongues
[1:39:08] oh yes now watch them it was designed to
[1:39:11] give them after this abstract it was
[1:39:14] designed to give them every promise
[1:39:17] that was on the grounds
[1:39:20] watches every promise that was on the
[1:39:23] grounds
[1:39:24] so you see
[1:39:25] they didn't have to just take one thing
[1:39:29] luther took justifications and that's
[1:39:31] all we want to eat
[1:39:32] wesley said sentimentation that's all we
[1:39:35] want to eat
[1:39:36] or we'll have a little bite of
[1:39:37] justification too but and then azusa
[1:39:40] street said well we'll have the gifts
[1:39:41] give us a platter of gifts
[1:39:44] come on
[1:39:45] but there's more to it
[1:39:48] amen brother branham was saying there's
[1:39:50] more two tongues
[1:39:52] more than comes to the pentecostal
[1:39:54] people and you say but we've got the
[1:39:56] word brother tim then the word that has
[1:39:59] everything that's on the ground

[1:40:43] hallelujah it gives you everything on
[1:40:47] the grounds
[1:40:50] [Applause]
[1:40:59] now
[1:41:01] it was designed to give them every
[1:41:02] promise on the ground
[1:41:04] every promise on the grounds of god's
[1:41:06] word
[1:41:08] that was promised in the bible
[1:41:10] that quickening power was given to them
[1:41:13] to quicken that promise to them
[1:41:16] el shaddai was right there quickening
[1:41:19] by the words he spoke to abraham of
[1:41:21] faith
[1:41:22] to start believing oh did he smell my ah
[1:41:26] i didn't call ishmael i'm gonna bring
[1:41:28] isaac
[1:41:29] he's gonna be a child of the
[1:41:30] supernatural
[1:41:32] won't be your own ability
[1:41:34] it'll be a child of the supernatural and
[1:41:37] so he said he said therefore
[1:41:40] therefore they laid hands on the sick
[1:41:43] and they were healed they spoke in new
[1:41:46] tongues they did great signs and wonders
[1:41:48] because that was in god's promise and
[1:41:52] when jesus tried to redeem that back to
[1:41:55] them the grounds that belonged to the
[1:41:56] sons of god he demonstrated what god
[1:42:00] was
[1:42:01] so all you have to do is look and see
[1:42:03] what god was
[1:42:05] you can see him he was a healer
[1:42:09] a worker of miracles
[1:42:11] a savior
[1:42:13] to save from sin
[1:42:15] amen giving of doctrine of truth
[1:42:19] amen all of it he gave it all come on
[1:42:22] you just look back at the ministry of
[1:42:24] jesus christ and the same attitude that
[1:42:26] he had then is the same attitude he has
[1:42:29] now
[1:42:30] that was thou shalt i then this is how
[1:42:33] said i now and he's the same at every
[1:42:35] detail
[1:42:38] except now he's not dwelling in that
[1:42:40] corporal body he's now living in the
[1:42:42] body of his church
[1:42:44] and when jesus died to redeem that back
[1:42:46] to them the ground that belonged the
[1:42:48] sons of god he demonstrated what god is
[1:42:50] how dare
[1:42:52] we
[1:42:52] socialize that and put it to an
[1:42:54] organization we have no rights to do
[1:42:57] that
[1:42:59] how dare we say
[1:43:02] how dare we say that this is only for
[1:43:04] the pentecostal denominations
[1:43:08] the assembly god or the upc
[1:43:12] you have no right to put that in
[1:43:13] organization
[1:43:15] it is an experience
[1:43:18] amen pentecost is not a denomination our
[1:43:22] prophet told us over and over it is an
[1:43:25] experience
[1:43:26] you cannot hand it back and say that
[1:43:29] belongs back there to the assembly of
[1:43:31] god in the upc
[1:43:33] and the azusa movement the church of god
[1:43:36] and all the organization you cannot put
[1:43:38] it back there
[1:43:40] you have to look at it and say that is
[1:43:42] ours
[1:43:43] every promise on the ground
[1:43:46] amen how dare we to minimize that power
[1:43:50] that quickens the body until it
[1:43:52] overflows with such joy that our feet
[1:43:55] can't keep still
[1:43:56] our hands can't help but be raised amen
[1:44:00] are the tears are just overflowing and
[1:44:04] the mouth is speaking with both the
[1:44:06] heavenly language and an earthly
[1:44:08] language glorifying god
[1:44:12] hallelujah
[1:44:14] as he said it's the holy spirit
[1:44:17] today hunting out on his hearts that
[1:44:20] will believe that message everything
[1:44:23] in the bible that was promised is
[1:44:25] through that believer somebody say

[1:44:30] believer

[1:47:06] when he ripped the seals off the book
[1:47:09] he was clearing the deed

[1:50:45] you're ready for what he's trying to
[1:50:47] show
[1:50:48] the quickening power wasn't only in
[1:50:50] their soul
[1:50:56] that was through the you know death we
[1:50:57] don't want it brother we don't want it
[1:50:59] we don't want it we don't want no
[1:51:01] manifestation we don't want no fleshly
[1:51:03] demonstration we don't want it we don't
[1:51:05] want somebody shouting and jumping and
[1:51:08] speaking in tongues we don't want them
[1:51:10] blabbering screaming youngins in our
[1:51:12] church
[1:51:16] amen listen he said the quickening power
[1:51:19] wasn't only in their soul but it was all
[1:51:22] over them
[1:51:26] all over them amen not only the dynamics
[1:51:29] to come in to quicken but it quickened
[1:51:32] the mechanics you see what i mean they
[1:51:34] were so quick
[1:51:36] until their tongues began to speak in
[1:51:38] another language they were so quickened
[1:51:40] by the power of the resurrection of
[1:51:42] christ until they laid their hands they
[1:51:45] were so quick and with the quickening
[1:51:47] power until they laid their hands on the
[1:51:49] sick and they got well it quickened your
[1:51:52] mortal body
[1:51:53] [Applause]
[1:51:55] hallelujah
[1:51:56] amen what did we see when we when we saw
[1:51:59] mariah get healed hair got to going back
[1:52:02] the glory returned what did we see we
[1:52:05] saw her mortal body quicken
[1:52:10] what happened when atlanta ran all over
[1:52:12] this building
[1:52:14] amen what happened that day it quickened
[1:52:16] her mortal body
[1:52:21] hallelujah are you with me
[1:52:23] amen what happened when sister karen's
[1:52:25] sight came back and the glory of god
[1:52:28] moved over and little drew jumped up and
[1:52:30] ran around the room never had walked
[1:52:33] before never crawled before got him all
[1:52:36] by himself what happened it quickened
[1:52:38] his mortal body
[1:52:41] [Applause]
[1:52:46] hallelujah
[1:52:48] they were healed by laying on their
[1:52:49] hands
[1:52:50] and the spirit quickened their
[1:52:52] fellowship together with god
[1:52:55] the spirit quickened their fellowship
[1:52:58] with god and they were so quickened in
[1:53:01] the presence of god to when a person
[1:53:03] died and their soul had gone off it
[1:53:06] called him back to life again
[1:53:08] amen glory now i'm feeling religious
[1:53:11] that's right quicken not only was there
[1:53:13] his resurrection for himself but for
[1:53:16] whosoever will to this predestinated
[1:53:19] seed that's laying there quick it
[1:53:21] quickens the mortal body
[1:53:23] they laid hands on the sick
[1:53:25] and they s they recovered
[1:53:28] they prayed in the spirit they saw
[1:53:30] visions
[1:53:31] that called the dead back to life that's
[1:53:34] right it quickened their mortal body
[1:53:38] now here's his prayer for the church
[1:53:41] at the end of the sermon it is the
[1:53:42] horizon of the son you want to know the
[1:53:44] prayer he prayed over you
[1:53:46] may then father if they're sick may they
[1:53:49] walk out well
[1:53:51] may if they're crippled they walk out
[1:53:53] under the power of the holy spirit
[1:53:56] if they've been sinners may they walk
[1:53:58] out lost and clean
[1:54:00] and the mechanics by going in the
[1:54:02] dynamics from above the holy spirit and
[1:54:04] catch them away lord and quicken their
[1:54:07] mortal body then we shall hear genuine
[1:54:10] new tongues and powers of god love and
[1:54:13] told dying grace and living grace and a
[1:54:17] resurrected christ a body of bride
[1:54:20] representing him on the earth
[1:54:25] hallelujah you've been prayed over
[1:54:31] hallelujah the prophet prayed over you
[1:54:34] amen quicken their mortal bodies
[1:54:37] quicken now now
[1:54:39] now the holy ghost
[1:54:41] gives faith for the rapture
[1:54:44] faith for the rapture lays within the
[1:54:47] holy ghost the dynamics of this church
[1:54:50] will be a refilling of the holy ghost
[1:54:54] it lies within the life-giving flow from
[1:54:57] how shady i
[1:54:59] when it's received in its fullness
[1:55:02] now listen church and here's a danger we
[1:55:05] are living in a an awful age
[1:55:08] and it's an age where there's scoffers
[1:55:10] not only scoffers there's impersonators
[1:55:13] and these impersonators also scoff and
[1:55:16] cause the word to be scoffed at
[1:55:18] now i want to get this we've been
[1:55:21] preaching a bit evangelistically now i
[1:55:23] want to i want to deal with this
[1:55:24] scripturally for a moment
[1:55:26] because we cannot look
[1:55:29] and see
[1:55:30] how the devil has impersonated this
[1:55:33] experience
[1:55:34] and cheapen the gift of speaking in
[1:55:37] tongues and the nine spiritual gifts and
[1:55:40] then dismiss that and take it from your
[1:55:42] inheritance we cannot do that
[1:55:45] you cannot preach the open book and part
[1:55:48] of it missing
[1:55:51] you cannot say the true or the true
[1:55:53] understanding of godhead is important
[1:55:56] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[1:55:58] christ is a necessary part
[1:56:00] predestination and knowing we were in
[1:56:02] his thoughts before the foundational
[1:56:04] world and all that's necessary part but
[1:56:07] then speaking in tongues is not
[1:56:11] are the gifts of the spirit
[1:56:13] which that's just the least
[1:56:15] to be against any of the word
[1:56:19] is antichrist
[1:56:23] but you say but brother tim it's been
[1:56:26] impersonated
[1:56:29] it's been so impersonated
[1:56:32] standing in the gap
[1:56:33] now this is at the end the age that
[1:56:35] we're living in
[1:56:37] where we come through justification
[1:56:38] sanctification baptism in the spirit
[1:56:40] holy spirit had
[1:56:42] signs and wonders and all different
[1:56:44] things and the gifts has returned to the
[1:56:46] church such as divine healing and
[1:56:48] prophecy and speaking with tongues and
[1:56:50] interpretation
[1:56:51] and though it's been misrepresented
[1:56:55] terrifically
[1:56:57] this is this is after the seal stand in
[1:57:00] the gap jeffersonville sermon but yet
[1:57:02] that don't take away
[1:57:04] there is a good one
[1:57:06] there is a good one of a real genuine a
[1:57:09] gift to speak in tongues in tongues
[1:57:12] that's always supposed to be in the
[1:57:14] church
[1:57:18] now though it's been misrepresented
[1:57:22] terrifically there is a genuine gift
[1:57:26] that is always supposed to be in the
[1:57:29] church
[1:57:31] now listen listen we have what has
[1:57:34] happened in this age is a resisting of
[1:57:37] the truth
[1:57:40] if you'll talk with me in second timothy
[1:57:42] 3 and 7 the bible said they're ever
[1:57:44] learning never able to come to the
[1:57:46] knowledge of the truth all they learn
[1:57:48] doctrines and this and that but they
[1:57:49] don't ever never know the knowledge of
[1:57:52] the truth because the knowledge of the
[1:57:53] truth is jesus christ
[1:57:56] to know him as life
[1:57:58] now janice and jamborees withstood moses
[1:58:01] now i want you to know
[1:58:03] we're standing against the true prophet
[1:58:06] so does these also resist the truth so
[1:58:10] the bible is telling you truth is going
[1:58:12] to be
[1:58:13] resisted
[1:58:16] men of corrupt minds reprobate
[1:58:18] concerning the faith
[1:58:20] but they said proceed no further for
[1:58:22] their folly shall be made manifest in
[1:58:24] all men as theirs was also was
[1:58:27] now i want you to get this
[1:58:30] god sends moses down to israel
[1:58:34] now remember it was the coming of the
[1:58:35] lord
[1:58:37] it was
[1:58:39] he said i have come down
[1:58:41] to deliver them he meets them in a
[1:58:42] pillar of fire he said i have come down
[1:58:46] to deliver them
[1:58:49] so it was the coming of the lord now
[1:58:51] what did they see a prophet
[1:58:54] with a message
[1:58:56] from the pillar of fire
[1:58:58] that's what we've received in this day a
[1:59:01] message from the pillar of fire
[1:59:03] amen why because god has come down
[1:59:07] amen from heaven with a shout with a
[1:59:09] message
[1:59:10] are you with me
[1:59:12] amen now i want you to notice god gave
[1:59:14] him signs to prove he was from god
[1:59:20] now notice this
[1:59:22] he would come he said jehovah sent me
[1:59:25] and here's the science
[1:59:27] and at first the israelites rejoiced
[1:59:30] when they heard the message of god
[1:59:32] exodus 4 30
[1:59:34] and aaron spake all the words which the
[1:59:37] lord had spoken to moses and did the
[1:59:40] signs and the sight of the people and
[1:59:42] the people believed
[1:59:44] and when they heard that the lord had
[1:59:46] delivered or visited the children of
[1:59:48] israel and that he looked upon their
[1:59:49] afflictions then he they bowed their
[1:59:52] heads in worship so the first response
[1:59:55] on seeing the signs this is of god
[1:59:58] and it's for our deliverance
[2:00:01] is that right and they believed
[2:00:04] but now the resistance of the truth was
[2:00:07] caused by the impersonation
[2:00:10] of
[2:00:11] the miracles
[2:00:14] and it hardened the hearts of the
[2:00:15] egyptians
[2:00:17] didn't it not
[2:00:18] it also hardened our hearts to the
[2:00:20] israelites and made them to disbelief
[2:00:25] exodus 5 21
[2:00:27] and they said unto them the lord look
[2:00:28] upon you and judge
[2:00:30] because you have made our savior to be a
[2:00:32] horde in the eyes of pharaoh so here
[2:00:35] they come and said
[2:00:36] here in the eyes of pharaoh and his
[2:00:38] servants had put a sword in their hand
[2:00:40] to to say is what you have done is put a
[2:00:42] sword in your hand
[2:00:44] didn't deliver us at all you just put a
[2:00:46] sword in their hand
[2:00:49] exodus 14 12 and look again they
[2:00:53] referred back to this and said is this
[2:00:55] not the word that we did tell thee in
[2:00:57] egypt say it let us alone
[2:01:02] that we may serve the egyptians look at
[2:01:05] these here again these people after
[2:01:08] seeing the signs
[2:01:10] but then the impersonators came
[2:01:13] and they changed their whole tune about
[2:01:16] the signs
[2:01:20] no longer are they believing because
[2:01:22] they're signs
[2:01:24] they're saying we told you just leave us
[2:01:27] alone
[2:01:28] in our denominational egypt
[2:01:33] amen but you you brought us out because
[2:01:36] there was no graves in egypt
[2:01:38] and he said you've
[2:01:40] made us to be abhorrent in the eyes of
[2:01:42] pharaoh
[2:01:43] we you made a mockery out of us all by
[2:01:46] showing his signs
[2:01:49] so they began
[2:01:51] believing but the impersonation caused
[2:01:55] them to resent the signs
[2:02:00] watch now
[2:02:01] i want you to see the strong delusion
[2:02:03] caused by the resistance of truth by
[2:02:06] impersonating the signs
[2:02:08] that even called israel the seed of
[2:02:11] abraham and the children of the promise
[2:02:13] to begin to doubt
[2:02:16] it cheapened the gifts of god
[2:02:20] and its signs and wonders until they
[2:02:23] didn't want them
[2:02:28] and the same thing has happened in our
[2:02:30] day
[2:02:31] the same thing happened in our day the
[2:02:33] very signs that brother branham was sent
[2:02:36] to do
[2:02:37] to show us that the word was present to
[2:02:40] deliver us
[2:02:42] that i met with the pillar of fire by
[2:02:44] the time the impersonation started to
[2:02:47] happen among the pentecostals
[2:02:50] it cheapened it to the point that today
[2:02:54] some of the seed of abraham the message
[2:02:56] believers don't even want to sign
[2:03:03] now let me just tell you they knew it
[2:03:05] was being cheapened
[2:03:07] john g lake said that you know just a
[2:03:09] few years after azusa street and he was
[2:03:11] one of the elders at azusa street he
[2:03:13] said you know our tongues have become a
[2:03:15] bit rattly
[2:03:17] and they don't sound right
[2:03:19] they come right down i just listened to
[2:03:22] a testimony of brother valdez senior
[2:03:25] from the full gospel business man this
[2:03:27] is in january 1968
[2:03:30] now he was contemporary with isaac
[2:03:32] shakarian he was father of demon
[2:03:33] security he was 10 years old he was 10
[2:03:36] years old at azusa and isaac karen was
[2:03:39] 14.
[2:03:41] and then and this is his testimony now
[2:03:43] he's at the gospel businessmen and he's
[2:03:46] seeing a proliferation of tongues among
[2:03:48] them
[2:03:49] he's seeing baptists and methodists in
[2:03:51] this episcopalian and all of them begin
[2:03:54] to speak with tongues
[2:03:57] and listen this is what brother branham
[2:03:59] had problem there was no holiness there
[2:04:02] they still write on would would not
[2:04:04] submit to the word bob and hair pain in
[2:04:06] her face
[2:04:08] dressing like jezebel had their shorts
[2:04:10] on cross-dressing doing all the things
[2:04:12] come on
[2:04:14] and yet claiming the holy ghost and
[2:04:15] speaking in tongues at the drop of a hat
[2:04:18] until it cheapened the gift of god
[2:04:21] and i'm trying to get it to you until it
[2:04:23] made it so cheap till the seed of
[2:04:27] abraham didn't want it
[2:04:35] now valdez says
[2:04:37] brother valdez he was there 10 years old
[2:04:39] at azusa street
[2:04:41] when the power of god fell 62 years ago
[2:04:44] in los angeles and this is
[2:04:46] 1968
[2:04:48] that our hearts were open to what god
[2:04:50] was taking place and oh what a glorious
[2:04:52] experience it was and if you ask me this
[2:04:55] question brother valdez what is it
[2:04:57] after all these years of watching this
[2:04:59] wave of pentecost all over the world and
[2:05:02] what is it today that concerns you more
[2:05:04] than anything
[2:05:06] and this is my answer we have seen wave
[2:05:09] after wave of the power of god
[2:05:10] accompanied with healings and miracles
[2:05:12] and we thank god for our healings and
[2:05:14] signs and wonders and all those things
[2:05:17] but as we approach this very soon coming
[2:05:19] of the lord jesus christ and the
[2:05:21] terrific things that are going to take
[2:05:23] place proceeding is coming this one
[2:05:25] thing concerns me more than anything
[2:05:27] else
[2:05:29] let us not forget
[2:05:31] the most important thing of all remember
[2:05:34] this i believe
[2:05:35] in speaking in tongues i believe in
[2:05:37] gifts of the spirit i believe in
[2:05:39] manifestations of the power of god and i
[2:05:42] don't enjoy a dead pentecostal meeting
[2:05:46] however i know this
[2:05:48] is that saint paul
[2:05:50] if saint paul was trying to tell us
[2:05:52] anything more than anything else in
[2:05:54] first corinthians 11 12 13 and 14 he's
[2:05:58] telling us that
[2:05:59] no gift is a true standard of deep
[2:06:02] spirituality
[2:06:04] now stop for a moment
[2:06:06] janice and jambrice
[2:06:09] were magicians
[2:06:12] and they impersonated
[2:06:14] and threw their rods down and they
[2:06:16] become a serpent they didn't do that by
[2:06:19] the power of satan he can't create they
[2:06:21] did that by the power of god god allowed
[2:06:24] it for the hardening of hearts yes
[2:06:28] to bring a strong delusion
[2:06:31] not hold the thought now
[2:06:33] and and so this is it he said no gift is
[2:06:37] a true standard of deep spirituality now
[2:06:40] they had gifts
[2:06:41] they could even turn water into blood
[2:06:44] like moses did
[2:06:46] they they could stand there and bring
[2:06:48] plagues like moses did
[2:06:52] right yes amen they could cast their
[2:06:54] serpent their rod down and become a
[2:06:56] serpent
[2:06:57] like moses did
[2:07:00] the only thing moses swallowed theirs up
[2:07:03] their folly was made manifest
[2:07:05] but nevertheless you know
[2:07:07] no true gift or no gift is a true
[2:07:10] standard of deep spirituality hear it
[2:07:13] folks there is no gift that is a true
[2:07:16] standard of deep spirituality he said
[2:07:18] you can have all these gifts and if you
[2:07:20] haven't got the love of god it profits
[2:07:23] you nothing now we're approaching the
[2:07:25] coming of jesus and the thing as far as
[2:07:28] i'm concerned it is more important than
[2:07:31] anything else is holiness without which
[2:07:34] no man shall see the lord and pentecost
[2:07:37] was losing their holiness
[2:07:40] wouldn't it be a terrible thing to be
[2:07:42] correct doctrinally on the second coming
[2:07:45] and everything else and then be lost
[2:07:48] this is what he's warning
[2:07:50] this is a people and he goes on to say
[2:07:54] listen folks the most important thing
[2:07:56] from now on is the fruit of the spirit
[2:07:59] oh my god help us not to forget it
[2:08:02] listen in the midst of our shouting you
[2:08:04] can become so obsessed with the idea
[2:08:07] i've got to speak in tongues the first
[2:08:10] thing you know the big thing is speak in
[2:08:13] tongues
[2:08:15] and and that's what they did they made
[2:08:17] that the important thing it was more
[2:08:19] important than repentance
[2:08:22] it was more important than holiness
[2:08:25] it was more important than anything else
[2:08:29] as long as we speak in tongues we got
[2:08:31] the holy ghost
[2:08:32] and i want you to understand he said you
[2:08:35] become obsessed with the idea i've got
[2:08:38] to speak in tongues the first thing you
[2:08:39] know the big things that speak in
[2:08:41] tongues a brother came to me and he said
[2:08:43] you know i had a hard time receiving the
[2:08:45] baptism until a certain preacher come
[2:08:48] along and he showed me how easy it was
[2:08:51] and he says well all you have to do is
[2:08:53] start with one syllable and say da
[2:08:57] and keep saying da
[2:09:00] and then he said
[2:09:01] add another syllable and say do
[2:09:05] and then you say da do
[2:09:08] and then he said another one and say add
[2:09:10] another one and say da du di
[2:09:13] da du de and he said say that again
[2:09:16] brother that's wonderful wonderful
[2:09:18] you know dottie d daddy d daddy d oh
[2:09:22] hallelujah you received the baptism
[2:09:26] he said brother is an old-fashioned
[2:09:28] preacher with 52 years of pentecostal
[2:09:30] preaching behind me as far as i'm
[2:09:32] concerned those folks have that receive
[2:09:36] that that kind of experience only have a
[2:09:39] lot of da duty
[2:09:41] the bible still says your innermost
[2:09:44] being shall flow rivers of living waters
[2:09:48] say can you say man
[2:09:50] hey hallelujah i said
[2:09:52] rivers of living waters hallelujah that
[2:09:54] was his testimony
[2:09:58] amen what was this point you see it's
[2:10:00] not something you manufacture it's not
[2:10:03] something you work up
[2:10:05] it's out of your innermost being
[2:10:08] shuffler rivers
[2:10:11] not of wd
[2:10:13] not of an impersonation
[2:10:15] but the holy ghost overflowing in you
[2:10:19] hallelujah speak it out in your life
[2:10:21] glorifying god
[2:10:28] impersonations
[2:10:30] have done the same today until
[2:10:33] the mixed multitude of among believers
[2:10:35] say
[2:10:36] we don't want the anointing
[2:10:38] we don't need it
[2:10:40] you know because of the anointed ones at
[2:10:42] the end time
[2:10:45] remember the anointing was not sent for
[2:10:48] the terror
[2:10:49] it was sent for the wheat
[2:10:52] and just because the tear raised its
[2:10:54] hands up and dances and shouts
[2:10:56] because the rain don't mean we don't
[2:10:59] have the right
[2:11:01] to raise up our hands and dance and
[2:11:03] shout
[2:11:05] hallelujah because that rain was sent
[2:11:08] for us not the tariffs
[2:11:13] i want to submit to you we are the
[2:11:16] anointed ones at the end time
[2:11:19] the true anointed
[2:11:24] first john 2 and 7 but the anointing
[2:11:26] which you have received of him abideth
[2:11:28] in you
[2:11:29] this anointing a man abideth in you that
[2:11:32] you need not any man treat you but the
[2:11:35] same anointing teaches you of all things
[2:11:38] and it's a truth and there's no lie and
[2:11:40] even as it taught you you shall abide in
[2:11:42] him that's first john 2 27
[2:11:45] so you see the anointing that you
[2:11:47] receive abideth in you
[2:11:50] it's more than an anointing that comes
[2:11:52] and goes
[2:11:54] but this anointing that abides within
[2:11:56] you
[2:11:57] and you don't need anybody to say now
[2:12:00] that sin and that sin don't do this and
[2:12:02] don't do that and go with you to the
[2:12:03] grocery store to the clothing store and
[2:12:06] pick out your clothes amen but no he
[2:12:08] abideth in you and he teaches you all
[2:12:11] things
[2:12:15] and you shall abide in him
[2:12:17] now easter seal
[2:12:18] brother branham said while we're right
[2:12:20] at an easter when he raised we raised
[2:12:22] with him he sent the abstract back we
[2:12:25] hold it as a baptism of the holy ghost
[2:12:28] he is alive forevermore the same
[2:12:30] yesterday today and forever hebrews 38
[2:12:32] proves that he is the same his messianic
[2:12:36] his anointed ones believe that
[2:12:39] what is the messiah what is messiah
[2:12:42] messiah is the anointed one and now if
[2:12:46] he was the messiah but being the
[2:12:47] anointed one for that day to fulfill the
[2:12:50] word of god to be the redeemer and the
[2:12:53] anointed one and god raised up that body
[2:12:55] his bride is the anointed one for this
[2:13:01] day
[2:13:03] hallelujah i'm looking at a bunch of
[2:13:05] anointed ones
[2:13:07] anointed with the holy ghost
[2:13:09] amen not a holy ghost that comes and
[2:13:11] goes but it abides with you
[2:13:14] forever hallelujah i can hear him say
[2:13:18] and and who do you say this is give me a
[2:13:21] church that's so completely anointed
[2:13:24] with god until their ever action and
[2:13:27] move it's just saith the lord walk in
[2:13:30] that shekinah glory and i'll show you a
[2:13:32] messiah an anointed one upon the earth
[2:13:37] hallelujah
[2:13:39] he says in christ the mystery of god
[2:13:40] revealed that there would come a time he
[2:13:42] would express himself in fullness of his
[2:13:45] godhead deity through his church have
[2:13:48] the preeminent church the anointed man
[2:13:50] now the anointed people oh to bring back
[2:13:54] the anointed bride and bridegroom
[2:13:58] hallelujah you see that's it we have the
[2:14:01] anointing
[2:14:03] amen and of his anointing we have
[2:14:05] received grace upon grace
[2:14:09] and that anointing breaks the yoke of
[2:14:12] unbelief and doubts and fears come on
[2:14:15] causes us to believe
[2:14:18] but we can become reluctant to embrace
[2:14:21] signs and wonders
[2:14:23] and yet the signs and wonders of casting
[2:14:25] out devils and speaking new tongues
[2:14:27] laying hands on the sick and seeing them
[2:14:29] recover or to follow them that believe
[2:14:33] just because we find a bogus hundred
[2:14:36] dollar bill we can't allow counterfeits
[2:14:38] to cause us to burn our money
[2:14:41] that's right amen we cannot allow
[2:14:44] impersonators to cause us to despise the
[2:14:47] signs that god has given us
[2:14:50] we cannot disbelieve the signs
[2:14:55] why am i saying this because we must
[2:14:57] believe all the word
[2:15:00] amen it must saturate our entire being
[2:15:04] it must fill every fiber and to do this
[2:15:06] we must have all the word of god
[2:15:10] mark 16
[2:15:12] 20 what's this and they went forth and
[2:15:14] preached everywhere the lord working
[2:15:17] with them confirming the word with signs
[2:15:20] following this is what is to happen
[2:15:23] after we preach the word
[2:15:25] amen the word confirmed with signs
[2:15:27] following
[2:15:29] you say brother tim you don't need
[2:15:31] confirm brother branham it was confirmed
[2:15:33] in him let me it was confirmed in jesus
[2:15:35] so we didn't need brother branham
[2:15:39] if you're going to lose use that
[2:15:41] reasoning come on jesus did it all your
[2:15:43] bodies will become a denominational
[2:15:46] baptist church of christ
[2:15:49] you must be against the anointing
[2:15:51] amen they went for them priests
[2:15:53] everywhere and the lord was working with
[2:15:56] them confirming the signs with signs
[2:16:00] following
[2:16:02] hallelujah hebrews 2 and 4 god also
[2:16:06] bearing them witness both with signs and
[2:16:09] wonders and divers miracles and gifts of
[2:16:11] the holy ghost according to his own will
[2:16:14] god
[2:16:16] burying them witness
[2:16:19] god's going to bear the church witness
[2:16:22] the signs will follow them that believe
[2:16:25] this is the day again where the word is
[2:16:28] incarnate in a people as it was in
[2:16:31] christ 2 000 years ago

[2:17:58] tongue will he speak to this people to
[2:18:00] whom he said this is the rest wherewith
[2:18:04] he calls the weary to rest and this is

[2:18:24] and this is the wrath speaking of the
[2:18:26] holy ghost that would come
[2:18:28] paul would refer back to this scripture
[2:18:31] as being speaking in tongues by the holy
[2:18:34] ghost
[2:18:35] you see it's the hour of joel's prophecy
[2:18:38] i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh

[2:19:18] somebody with me mighty god unveiled he
[2:19:21] said it this way in joel 2 28 he
[2:19:23] promised in the last day there'd be a
[2:19:26] ladder rain poured out upon the people
[2:19:28] in the last day i think the greek word
[2:19:30] there is kinos which means he emptied
[2:19:33] himself out
[2:19:35] hallelujah this is a day he empties
[2:19:38] himself out in other words we receive
[2:19:40] all of god
[2:19:42] not just one doctrine of truth like
[2:19:44] luther had but the entire word revealed
[2:19:47] back again
[2:19:49] and with the entire word comes the
[2:19:51] entire power
[2:19:53] amen notice he said he emptied himself
[2:19:56] out not in the way he was said like
[2:19:58] something was inside of somebody that he
[2:19:59] emptied out but he poured himself out he
[2:20:02] changed him his morphine he changed from
[2:20:04] what he was to what he is he never
[2:20:07] changes his nature but on the day of
[2:20:09] pentecost he changed himself from being
[2:20:11] the son of man to the son of god and he

[2:24:05] want the rapture to happen
[2:24:07] i mean you want the resurrection to take
[2:24:09] place amen we got to hold ourselves
[2:24:12] steady a man for a few minutes till
[2:24:14] every fiber is filled with the holy
[2:24:17] ghost then she'll go up
[2:24:20] oh my calling his people to gather to
[2:24:22] himself in one true oneness with himself
[2:24:25] because it is his one holy spirit
[2:24:29] eat
[2:24:30] the book
[2:24:33] eat from el shaddai
[2:24:35] the whole book
[2:24:36] and then prophesy
[2:24:38] and then preach
[2:24:40] the whole book
[2:24:42] that's all i'm asking let's just preach
[2:24:44] the whole book
[2:24:47] come on
[2:24:49] but you see in that hour there also
[2:24:51] comes a strong delusion and a resistance
[2:24:55] to the truth
[2:24:57] now you see all satan needs to do
[2:25:01] is to get us to deny one word of the
[2:25:04] bible to be true
[2:25:06] and to refuse it to allow in our in our
[2:25:09] life to work in our lives
[2:25:12] that's the same as denying it
[2:25:17] come on
[2:25:18] amen listen listen
[2:25:20] well you said brother tim we believe we
[2:25:22] believe in healing we just don't preach
[2:25:24] it listen it won't work
[2:25:27] it's got to be preached
[2:25:30] are you with me
[2:25:32] you've got to prophesy the whole book
[2:25:34] [Applause]
[2:25:36] so what we we believe in the gifts but
[2:25:38] you know they're on the shelf well i
[2:25:40] doubt you even got a shelf
[2:25:43] but nevertheless you know if they're on
[2:25:45] your shelf for crying out loud get them
[2:25:47] off and use them
[2:25:49] they wasn't given to you to store in the
[2:25:51] jewelry box
[2:25:54] they were given to gil keep the church
[2:25:56] clean
[2:25:58] to chase out devils with to bring words
[2:26:00] of encouragement give faith in the
[2:26:03] hearts of believers
[2:26:05] to bring healing to the sick to cast out
[2:26:07] devils
[2:26:09] to speak in heavenly language to pray in
[2:26:11] the spirit to sing in the spirit
[2:26:14] [Applause]
[2:26:16] but in this hour
[2:26:18] there comes a strong delusion and a
[2:26:21] resistance to the truth
[2:26:25] all satan needs to do
[2:26:27] is to get us to deny one word of the
[2:26:30] bible to be true
[2:26:32] for today
[2:26:35] you might agree that's true oh yeah it
[2:26:37] happened and brother branham stopped but
[2:26:38] what about today well no that was only
[2:26:40] you see
[2:26:42] you become church of christ
[2:26:44] amen
[2:26:46] and and i'm i'm speaking about alexander
[2:26:49] campbell's church of christ
[2:26:51] where you're against the anointing
[2:26:54] because you say it all happened in
[2:26:56] brother branagh's ministry and we don't
[2:26:57] need it now
[2:26:59] i don't know who we are
[2:27:01] but i'm not part of you
[2:27:04] amen but anyway you see all he needs to
[2:27:08] do is get us to deny one word of the
[2:27:10] bible or refuse it to work
[2:27:14] now laodicea is the last church agent is
[2:27:17] to be blind and satan comes along with
[2:27:20] that blindness until christ the
[2:27:22] anointing and the word is refused
[2:27:26] entrance
[2:27:28] go with me to revelations 3 17 but thou
[2:27:31] saith i am rich i'm increased with goods
[2:27:33] i have needed nothing and no it's not
[2:27:35] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[2:27:37] poor and blind and naked
[2:27:39] now i want you to notice in the day
[2:27:42] in the day when god pours out his spirit
[2:27:46] there is also a blindness
[2:27:49] that comes in that same age
[2:27:54] look at what is happening here laodicea
[2:27:57] the last expression of deity to the
[2:28:00] church the amen of god the final say the
[2:28:02] full word
[2:28:05] and it gets rejected
[2:28:07] by his own church
[2:28:09] now watch i want you to notice in the
[2:28:12] day when god pours out of spirit i want
[2:28:13] to read joel 2 23 because brother
[2:28:16] branham constantly pointed us back to
[2:28:18] joel chapter 2
[2:28:20] as happening today this is the latter
[2:28:22] rain
[2:28:24] now in joel 2 23
[2:28:27] be glad you children of zion and rejoice
[2:28:30] in the lord your god for he hath given
[2:28:32] you the former rain moderately he will
[2:28:34] cause come down for you the rain to form
[2:28:37] a rain and the latter rain in the first
[2:28:39] month the floors should be full of wheat
[2:28:42] and the fat shall overflow with wine and
[2:28:45] oil don't sound like a time of
[2:28:46] starvation does it
[2:28:48] amen it's a full crop it's harvest time
[2:28:52] there's plenty and i will restore to you
[2:28:56] the years that the locusts the cancer
[2:28:58] war and the caterpillar and the palmer
[2:29:01] my great army which i sent among you
[2:29:04] now
[2:29:05] if you stop here just for a minute this
[2:29:07] was originally spoke to israel about
[2:29:10] their captivity and their restoration
[2:29:13] but it was speaking to
[2:29:15] israel spiritual israel also
[2:29:18] that there would be a come a time of
[2:29:20] restoration there would be four insects
[2:29:23] which would be as you saw the locust the
[2:29:26] cankerworm the caterpillar and the
[2:29:28] palmer worm all of these all of these
[2:29:31] four insects would go forth these are
[2:29:33] the same as the spirits under the seal a
[2:29:36] white horse a red a black and a pale
[2:29:39] now they would ride there would be an
[2:29:41] army and they would strip away
[2:29:44] the promises of god from the church
[2:29:46] brother branham would go at great
[2:29:48] lengths and he said some of that was joy
[2:29:51] that would strip off the tree healing he
[2:29:54] would strip off the tree working some
[2:29:56] miracles and he'd strip off the tree he
[2:29:58] would strip the bride tree down
[2:30:01] but he says i will restore
[2:30:04] saith the lord
[2:30:06] amen and ye shall eat in plenty amen
[2:30:11] and be satisfied
[2:30:14] hallelujah said eyes not going to run
[2:30:16] out and praise the name of the lord your
[2:30:19] god that it that wonders with you and my
[2:30:23] people shall never be embarrassed
[2:30:26] i'm not gonna let them down when they
[2:30:28] need healing it's gonna be there when
[2:30:31] they need the holy ghost it's gonna be
[2:30:33] there hallelujah amen when they need
[2:30:36] deliverance it's gonna be in the house
[2:30:38] of god come on hallelujah my people
[2:30:41] shall never be left holding the bag and
[2:30:45] standing there empty-handed but every
[2:30:48] promise that i have is going to be yours
[2:30:51] [Applause]
[2:30:53] and you will know that i'm in the midst
[2:30:56] of my bride and i am the lord your god
[2:30:59] and none else and my people shall never
[2:31:02] be ashamed and it shall come to pass
[2:31:04] afterwards i will pour out my spirit
[2:31:07] upon all flesh and your sons and
[2:31:09] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[2:31:12] shall dream dreams your young men shall
[2:31:15] see vision and upon the servants upon my
[2:31:18] handmaids in those days will i pour out
[2:31:20] my spirit and i will show wonders in the
[2:31:23] heavens and the earth and blood and fire
[2:31:25] and pillars of smoke and the sun shall
[2:31:28] be turned into darkness
[2:31:30] and the moon in the blood
[2:31:33] before the great and terrible day of the
[2:31:36] lord come
[2:31:37] and it shall come to pass
[2:31:39] that whosoever shall call on the name of
[2:31:41] the lord
[2:31:43] shall be delivered
[2:31:45] for in mount zion that's the bright yes
[2:31:48] and in jerusalem that's israel and in
[2:31:51] the remnant that's the foolish virgin
[2:31:53] 144 thousand whom the lord shall call
[2:31:57] there's going to be deliverance in all
[2:31:59] three of those places
[2:32:02] are you with me
[2:32:03] now peter picks up on this
[2:32:06] and he preaches this and he says this
[2:32:08] coming of the holy ghost
[2:32:11] which brother branham said was el
[2:32:13] shaddai
[2:32:14] the almighty god coming down to live in
[2:32:17] them to do in them what they couldn't do
[2:32:19] their self and he says now he said this
[2:32:22] is that which the prophet joel spoke of
[2:32:27] amen now brother branham comes along and
[2:32:29] he also declares this is that
[2:32:32] and he adds to it if this ain't that
[2:32:35] i'll keep this till that comes
[2:32:38] is that right
[2:32:39] but i want you to notice in acts chapter
[2:32:42] 2 and verse 20
[2:32:43] again it says the sun
[2:32:45] shall be turned to darkness
[2:32:48] and the moon into blood
[2:32:51] before that great and notable day of the
[2:32:54] lord shall come now the notable day of
[2:32:56] the lord is the time of tribulation
[2:33:00] and there is going to be
[2:33:03] a time of darkness
[2:33:07] in the time where great light is coming
[2:33:12] this is what brother madam preached us
[2:33:13] in shalom he said his darkness to the
[2:33:15] world
[2:33:16] and they're keeping on getting darker
[2:33:19] he said look at the darkness there in
[2:33:21] the homosexuals and what is happening
[2:33:23] with them the perversion
[2:33:25] he said even they wear blue
[2:33:28] blue
[2:33:29] suede with purple shoes and you know
[2:33:31] he's just talking about a feminine
[2:33:33] dressing
[2:33:36] are you with me amen don't let me just
[2:33:39] tell you this there there is there is
[2:33:43] there is
[2:33:44] perhaps physical darkness that will come
[2:33:47] upon the earth during the tribulation
[2:33:49] like in the days of the plague upon
[2:33:51] egypt
[2:33:52] but the spiritual darkness will come
[2:33:55] first
[2:33:59] i want you to get this this is very
[2:34:01] pertinent to the hour we're living in
[2:34:05] that before before right here before the
[2:34:10] the great and dreadful day comes
[2:34:13] there's going to come a time of
[2:34:14] spiritual darkness
[2:34:16] on the earth
[2:34:19] and it'll get blacker than you ever saw
[2:34:22] it would get so black for brother
[2:34:24] branham said he said i couldn't see
[2:34:26] beyond 77
[2:34:29] and we're now
[2:34:30] how many years into the hour of darkness
[2:34:37] now
[2:34:38] so as i said i'm not trying to do away
[2:34:40] with physical darkness perhaps there
[2:34:42] will come
[2:34:44] you know a darkness over the earth
[2:34:46] but let me just say
[2:34:49] there is a spiritual darkness
[2:34:51] that is here now
[2:34:58] now remember
[2:34:59] christ is being rejected
[2:35:03] and the last place he's been made
[2:35:05] welcome is the bride
[2:35:08] and i'm just saying let's be careful not
[2:35:10] to reject him
[2:35:14] in the closing of the gentle jewish
[2:35:16] dispensation they became so blinded
[2:35:20] by satan
[2:35:21] the sun and the moon the light of god
[2:35:25] became darkness
[2:35:27] so that in that darkness they rejected
[2:35:31] and crucified the messiah and the gospel
[2:35:36] turned to the gentiles
[2:35:40] that's how dark it was now peter said on
[2:35:42] the day of pentecost this is that and
[2:35:45] there was there was a spiritual darkness
[2:35:47] right then
[2:35:49] on the earth and they crucified
[2:35:52] their messiah under the cover of
[2:35:55] darkness and rejected him they there
[2:35:59] the mother they're in the most holy city
[2:36:03] they the most holy people crucified the
[2:36:07] most awful punishment
[2:36:09] him the lord of glory
[2:36:15] now this very same thing happens
[2:36:19] at the pouring out of the spirit in the
[2:36:21] end time
[2:36:23] now
[2:36:24] it happens as joel 2 repeats
[2:36:28] until there's such a strong delusion
[2:36:31] until the light becomes so dark sun in
[2:36:34] the moon that represents the light of
[2:36:36] both night and day
[2:36:37] and the word becomes so obscure
[2:36:41] until they crucify the word they can't
[2:36:44] crucify the man
[2:36:46] so they crucify now the word and put it
[2:36:50] to an open shame and christ is on the
[2:36:53] outside of the church rejected and the
[2:36:56] gospel turns back to the jews
[2:37:00] now are you with me now now brother
[2:37:02] branham tells us in the indictment he
[2:37:04] said today there is a new calvary
[2:37:08] in this time of darkness there is a new
[2:37:11] calvary
[2:37:12] and he said where where is it found at
[2:37:14] in the most holy places the church
[2:37:18] where is he crucified at from the
[2:37:20] pastors
[2:37:22] amen and he calls them you hypocrites
[2:37:25] you know better than that
[2:37:27] that i'm not angry but something inside
[2:37:29] of me is stirring god has been
[2:37:31] thoroughly identified among you where
[2:37:33] did he get his spears that is in his
[2:37:35] side
[2:37:36] where did he get his piercers
[2:37:38] on calvary where did he get it today in
[2:37:41] the pulpit
[2:37:44] where did they come from jerusalem
[2:37:46] where do they come from the denomination
[2:37:48] the ones who claim that love him that
[2:37:51] that's who did it
[2:37:54] so christ is being crucified from the
[2:37:57] pulpit listen we are going to stand for
[2:38:00] him
[2:38:01] in this pulpit we're not going to
[2:38:03] crucify the lord of glory
[2:38:07] we're going to say he's the saint
[2:38:08] yesterday today and forever we're going
[2:38:11] to declare he's alive that he's not dead
[2:38:15] hallelujah but he's living among us
[2:38:18] you say brother tim it's just the
[2:38:20] denomination no he said i indict the
[2:38:23] denomination and many of the
[2:38:25] independence
[2:38:28] there are many today even in message
[2:38:30] pulpits that are crucifying jesus christ
[2:38:34] afresh
[2:38:37] his hardest spear points have come from
[2:38:39] the pulpits
[2:38:41] that criticize
[2:38:42] don't go hear such stuff as that
[2:38:45] don't want our kids going to that youth
[2:38:47] camp
[2:38:50] come on
[2:38:51] amen and it's called the devil
[2:38:55] where from the pulpits
[2:38:58] men stand in the pulpit oh to fall out
[2:39:00] under the spirit that's only demons do
[2:39:02] that well they did it all the time in
[2:39:04] john wesley and brother brannon said it
[2:39:06] was a holy ghost
[2:39:08] amen they did it when it happened when
[2:39:10] john fell at his feet it's dead it
[2:39:12] happened in daniel's day it happened all
[2:39:15] down to the bible come on amen they
[2:39:17] stood in the presence of god and
[2:39:19] couldn't stand
[2:39:20] amen
[2:39:22] and then the call that the devil is
[2:39:23] blaspheming me
[2:39:25] and it's crucifying the lord of glory
[2:39:29] are you with me where he's getting the
[2:39:31] hardest pierces from the pulpit crowned
[2:39:34] from the audience by scoffers
[2:39:37] he's got a new crown of thorn scoffers
[2:39:40] pierced from the pulpit crowned by the
[2:39:42] scoffers is he crucified again stripped
[2:39:46] by or striped by man-made creeds
[2:39:49] teachers of denominations against the
[2:39:51] word they stripe it in shame condemn it
[2:39:56] so you see if there's a crucifixion of
[2:39:58] christ today it is not physical it is
[2:40:02] spiritual
[2:40:04] the word is being crucified
[2:40:08] the spirit is being rejected
[2:40:11] and any place or pulpit that rejects or
[2:40:14] crucifies a word that scuffs it healing
[2:40:17] shouting rejoicing dancing to the spirit
[2:40:20] prayer lines
[2:40:21] according to revelation 11 they are
[2:40:24] spiritually called sodom and egypt where
[2:40:28] also our lord was crucified
[2:40:32] amen in hebrews 6 he says they crucify
[2:40:35] to themselves the son of god afresh and
[2:40:38] put him to an open chain
[2:40:42] now let me just show you in matthew 27
[2:40:45] verse 45 at the sixth hour there was
[2:40:48] darkness over the land unto the ninth
[2:40:51] hour so at the crucifixion of christ
[2:40:54] there was darkness yes over the land
[2:40:58] are you with me now
[2:41:00] so
[2:41:01] if that is so and he's being crucified
[2:41:03] again
[2:41:06] then what is it darkness has now come
[2:41:09] over the land today
[2:41:12] now in this darkness a strong delusion
[2:41:17] arises
[2:41:19] notice brother branham in junction at a
[2:41:21] time
[2:41:22] as he moses goes down to egypt he took
[2:41:25] his stomach stuff her stick and he cast
[2:41:27] it down he healed with his hands with
[2:41:30] leprosy and done those things and then i
[2:41:32] want you to notice every time the
[2:41:34] miraculous done satan was there to
[2:41:36] counterfeit it
[2:41:38] and as he was counterfeited in that day
[2:41:40] he's still the same counterfeiter today
[2:41:43] and his counterfeits only point to the
[2:41:46] end time
[2:41:47] at the junction
[2:41:49] he had some old soul sayers down there
[2:41:51] by the name of janice and jamboree who
[2:41:53] stood up and they could throw their rods
[2:41:55] down turn them the serpents and so forth
[2:41:57] and do just like they did
[2:42:00] but god vindicated who was god's they
[2:42:03] could bring pledge but they couldn't
[2:42:04] perform divine healing so only god alone
[2:42:07] can heal they could bring a boil but
[2:42:09] they couldn't take it away god stood in
[2:42:12] his power there to show that real divine
[2:42:14] healing was his miraculous to prove the
[2:42:17] omnipotent was at the junction road yes
[2:42:22] amen now so again he goes right on down
[2:42:25] through this and he talks about it that
[2:42:28] that here at this very time he said the
[2:42:31] moon shall fail to give her light
[2:42:35] and the sun won't shine will turn as
[2:42:37] black as sackcloth and like blood
[2:42:40] and when she hides her face and weeps
[2:42:43] herself and sweats out dropping bloody
[2:42:46] drops of grief god will be on the earth
[2:42:51] omnipotent doing the miraculous
[2:42:55] so when this happens god will be on the
[2:42:59] earth
[2:43:00] when the light is held back from the
[2:43:03] church
[2:43:04] and rejected god will be doing on the
[2:43:07] earth omnipotent doing the miraculous
[2:43:13] hallelujah
[2:43:14] so just as there was darkness in that
[2:43:17] day there's darkness coming upon the
[2:43:19] land in this day
[2:43:21] creeping right in
[2:43:23] a blinded delusion
[2:43:25] so deluded to christ and rejected
[2:43:28] and satan sits within the church and is
[2:43:30] worshipped as god
[2:43:33] for ii thessalonians 2 and three and
[2:43:36] four tells us this
[2:43:38] but i want you to look at verse 10 of
[2:43:40] second thessalonians 2 2 10.
[2:43:42] it says with all deceivableness of
[2:43:44] unrighteousness in them that perish my
[2:43:47] what deception because they receive not
[2:43:50] the love of the truth that they might be
[2:43:53] saved
[2:43:54] and for this cause god shall send them a
[2:43:57] strong delusion because they didn't love
[2:44:00] truth
[2:44:02] that day god sent him a strong delusion
[2:44:04] that they would believe a lie
[2:44:07] now of course you see this is where
[2:44:10] we're at that people are today under a
[2:44:13] strong delusion under the shadow of
[2:44:16] darkness
[2:44:18] amen now go with me to revelation 9 1
[2:44:21] and the fifth angel sounded and i saw a
[2:44:24] star fall from heaven to the earth and
[2:44:26] the hymn was given the key of the
[2:44:27] bottomless pit and he opened the
[2:44:29] bottomless pit and there roses smoke
[2:44:32] out of the pit as a smoke of a great
[2:44:35] furnace it wasn't a little smoke
[2:44:38] it was a smoke of a grapefruit and look
[2:44:40] the sun
[2:44:41] and the air that's atmosphere were
[2:44:44] darkened by the reason of the smoke of
[2:44:48] the pit
[2:44:51] and they came out of the pit or either
[2:44:53] smoke locusts or demons listen when this
[2:44:58] atmosphere was created
[2:45:00] demons began to come out of it
[2:45:05] notice the sun and the sun was blackened
[2:45:09] the sun is the light of the word
[2:45:15] and the word was rejected and when it
[2:45:18] happened it it comes now black and then
[2:45:22] with a strong delusion black in the
[2:45:24] light of the word where you can't see
[2:45:26] clearly the word of god
[2:45:28] and what is promised and it's disdained
[2:45:30] and unwanted come on church amen and out
[2:45:34] of there it causes something to happen
[2:45:36] in the air and the atmosphere becomes
[2:45:39] charged
[2:45:40] with demons
[2:45:43] spirits of affliction
[2:45:46] oh
[2:45:47] my
[2:45:48] we could read all about it brother
[2:45:49] branham said they were supernatural
[2:45:52] chargers
[2:45:54] demons writing
[2:45:56] coming to torment men
[2:46:00] this is what is happening in right now
[2:46:05] it only gets worse when the tribulation
[2:46:07] starts
[2:46:09] right now
[2:46:11] hell has opened its mouth
[2:46:14] right now
[2:46:15] the atmospheres are being charged
[2:46:18] what do you think is happening in the
[2:46:20] atmosphere of our school they're charged
[2:46:24] with every kind of blackness of sin
[2:46:27] evil perversion
[2:46:29] of every kind
[2:46:31] i mean teaching kids it can be become a
[2:46:34] cat or a dog put a litter box there for
[2:46:37] them i mean teaching them you know uh
[2:46:41] castigating them because of you using
[2:46:43] the gender pro death pronoun that they
[2:46:45] were born with
[2:46:47] insanity
[2:46:49] and it's happening in politics
[2:46:52] where our supreme court justice could
[2:46:54] not even define a woman
[2:46:59] she couldn't i'm not a biologist
[2:47:02] well a stupid human being would know
[2:47:04] whether you're a boy or girl
[2:47:07] amen this is a basic
[2:47:09] but it's insanity
[2:47:12] and it kills a third part in other words
[2:47:15] there's a temporary adjustments that are
[2:47:17] poured out on the earth a third part of
[2:47:20] the men are killed by the fire and by
[2:47:23] the smoke and by the brimstone that open
[2:47:25] out of their mouth that's verse 18. so
[2:47:27] you see it brings death
[2:47:30] i'm telling you the atmosphere is
[2:47:34] charged to bring death
[2:47:37] spiritual death
[2:47:42] your word about covet covet is not the
[2:47:44] killer spiritual death is the killer
[2:47:48] and it only becomes worse
[2:47:51] in the tribulation
[2:47:53] in the tribulation revelation 6 12 and
[2:47:56] when it opened the sixth seal which is
[2:47:58] tribulation seal there was a great
[2:48:00] earthquake and the sun became black as
[2:48:03] exactly of hair and the moon became his
[2:48:06] blood
[2:48:08] amen and the stars fell into the earth
[2:48:12] even as the fig tree casted her untimely
[2:48:15] figs when she is shaken by a mighty wind
[2:48:21] listen when in the tribulation the the
[2:48:25] the sun becomes blacker than ever
[2:48:29] this is what it says
[2:48:31] it said black is a sackcloth of hair
[2:48:33] this this is a description
[2:48:35] it has come to where there is no light
[2:48:39] because that's the way the laodicean age
[2:48:41] ends no light
[2:48:43] goes out into total darkness
[2:48:48] and the stars of heaven fell into the
[2:48:50] earth as a fig tree casters are untimely
[2:48:53] fish when she's shaken out of a
[2:48:56] mighty wind now
[2:48:58] there may be spiritual darkness or
[2:49:00] physical darkness sure
[2:49:02] but
[2:49:02] but for sure
[2:49:04] there is spiritual darkness
[2:49:06] look at the stars of heaven fall to the
[2:49:09] earth
[2:49:10] think of that for a moment
[2:49:12] one star not stars
[2:49:15] one star
[2:49:17] would annihilate the earth
[2:49:22] one true star ball of fire
[2:49:26] would
[2:49:27] totally
[2:49:29] disintegrate the earth
[2:49:34] watch now
[2:49:36] one star
[2:49:37] would annihilate so these are not
[2:49:40] all the stars fallen
[2:49:43] these are angels falling
[2:49:48] in revelation 9 1 and the fifth angel
[2:49:51] sounded and i saw a star fell from
[2:49:54] heaven
[2:49:55] and to him to him he was a prison was
[2:49:59] was a being
[2:50:00] was not a planet it was not a ball of
[2:50:03] fire to him was given permission to open
[2:50:07] the bottomless pit
[2:50:11] are you with me now
[2:50:12] amen as the bride goes up
[2:50:15] satan is cast down
[2:50:17] revelation 12 and the great dragon verse
[2:50:20] 9 and the great dragon was cast out that
[2:50:23] old serpent called the devil and satan
[2:50:25] which deceiveth the whole world and he
[2:50:27] was cast out into the earth and his
[2:50:30] angels was cast out with him and the
[2:50:32] bible said that he his tale drew the
[2:50:35] stars of heaven and cast them to the
[2:50:38] earth because with him come fallen
[2:50:40] angels and these fallen angels were
[2:50:42] demon powers that we're reading about
[2:50:47] supernatural charges attacking the mind
[2:50:51] of man
[2:50:56] this is exactly this is exactly again
[2:50:58] isaiah 14 12 how has i fallen from
[2:51:02] heaven or lucifer son of the morning how
[2:51:04] does thou cut down the ground which
[2:51:06] weakens the nation
[2:51:08] you see the sun and the moon represents
[2:51:11] christ and the true church
[2:51:14] and with rejection of christ and his
[2:51:16] bride this causes the whole world to go
[2:51:20] in complete total darkness where the
[2:51:24] fullness of evil prevails
[2:51:28] and i want to get this to you because
[2:51:30] we're preaching about every fiber every
[2:51:33] fiber and fabric of humanity will be
[2:51:37] filled with perverseness and wickedness
[2:51:44] if god don't feel every fiber of yours
[2:51:47] the devil will take that place
[2:51:52] this is why it is so important to be
[2:51:55] filled with the fullness of god
[2:51:58] because he can hurt only those who have
[2:52:01] not the seal of god in their forehead
[2:52:05] [Music]
[2:52:06] hallelujah i'm telling you there is a
[2:52:09] protection
[2:52:10] amen from the spirits of darkness it
[2:52:14] might be knocking at your mind and
[2:52:16] pushing at your mind and trying to make
[2:52:18] you disbelieve and to doubt but there is
[2:52:21] a protection it's called the seal of god
[2:52:26] hallelujah it's called the holy ghost
[2:52:29] it's called because he has filled every
[2:52:32] fiber
[2:52:33] every fiber of your mind
[2:52:36] [Applause]
[2:52:40] give god that anxiety
[2:52:43] give him that anxiousness
[2:52:45] give him that worry
[2:52:47] give it over to him let god feel it
[2:52:55] look
[2:52:56] in the tribulation
[2:52:59] revelation 16 70 and the seventh angel
[2:53:03] poured out his vial into the air
[2:53:06] atmospheres
[2:53:09] and there was a great voice at the
[2:53:11] temple of heaven from the throne saying
[2:53:13] it's done and there were voices and
[2:53:15] thunders and lightning and there was a
[2:53:16] great earthquake such as not since men
[2:53:18] were upon the earth so mighty an
[2:53:20] earthquake and so
[2:53:22] and so great
[2:53:25] of course
[2:53:27] those vials are fully poured out during
[2:53:29] the tribulation
[2:53:30] but the trumpets and the vials correlate
[2:53:32] together
[2:53:34] and we've already had temporary
[2:53:37] which causes a third of men showing it's
[2:53:39] only temporary it's not getting all just
[2:53:42] it's a portion
[2:53:43] and the and the trumpets and the vials
[2:53:45] correlate together and they've already
[2:53:47] been poured out temporary judgments
[2:53:50] and i want you to know the seventh one
[2:53:52] pours it out into the air
[2:53:56] so you see in the atmosphere
[2:54:00] it's poured out in in
[2:54:03] i i
[2:54:04] i'm not talking about these contrails up
[2:54:06] here
[2:54:08] i'm not preaching some stupid crazy uh
[2:54:10] conspiracy theories and trying to kill
[2:54:12] all the old people with these contrails
[2:54:15] up in the sky i'm talking about the
[2:54:17] atmosphere
[2:54:19] of homes that have been changed
[2:54:21] the atmosphere of people's lives that
[2:54:23] have been changed the atmosphere of the
[2:54:26] fabric of our country as he turns from
[2:54:30] lamb
[2:54:31] speaking with freedom of religion to a
[2:54:33] dragon
[2:54:35] and speak says the devil because she
[2:54:38] becomes under that atmosphere
[2:54:43] and it's now in the fabrics of our
[2:54:45] nation in our supreme court in our
[2:54:48] presidency
[2:54:51] in the senate
[2:54:54] in the house
[2:54:56] in the republicans
[2:55:01] in the conservatives
[2:55:04] because the only way you're going to be
[2:55:05] a conservative of truths conservatives
[2:55:07] be the bride of christ
[2:55:10] come on now
[2:55:11] we're an endangered species
[2:55:14] in the democrats oh yeah them democrats
[2:55:16] let me tell you the republicans are the
[2:55:19] same
[2:55:20] they're a bunch of sinners a whole bunch
[2:55:21] of them
[2:55:22] what is it and their atmosphere of our
[2:55:25] country and world has to has changed men
[2:55:28] unto evil

[2:55:34] and cause him to go into a into school
[2:55:37] and just murder kids indiscriminately
[2:55:40] without feeling
[2:55:46] and that's just not an isolated case
[2:55:50] it's happening over and over and over
[2:55:52] and over and our world is going crazy
[2:55:55] and the spirit of lawlessness has taken
[2:55:58] over
[2:56:00] because the man of sin
[2:56:03] is now being manifested in his people
[2:56:07] but at the same time the son of man
[2:56:10] is being manifested in bright form
[2:56:14] hallelujah and there is a people that's
[2:56:17] got a thinking man's filter that gave
[2:56:20] them a holy man's taste

[3:00:57] was was in darkness he said you had your
[3:00:59] understanding darkened
[3:01:02] and that's all that can happen when
[3:01:03] you're alienated from the life of god
[3:01:05] through ignorance that is in them and
[3:01:07] the blindness of your heart your
[3:01:09] understanding just becomes more dark
[3:01:12] more dark
[3:01:13] paul would say it like this in this
[3:01:15] translation i insist and god backs me up
[3:01:18] on this that there's no going on along
[3:01:20] with the crowd the empty-headed mindless
[3:01:23] crowd they refuse for so long to deal
[3:01:27] with god that they've lost trust not
[3:01:29] only with god but with reality itself
[3:01:31] they can't think straight anymore
[3:01:33] feeling no pain in other words having no
[3:01:36] conscience they let themselves go in the
[3:01:38] sexual obsession addicted to every sort
[3:01:41] of perversion
[3:01:44] notice the blindness
[3:01:46] that is caused by the smoke
[3:01:48] from the fires of the bottomless pit
[3:01:52] it says it will be in the last day
[3:01:57] amen

[3:02:42] sublime you and make you where you can't
[3:02:45] see but i'll tell you god has provided a
[3:02:48] remedy

[3:02:52] the sun and the moon the light the word
[3:02:55] and its fullness and it blinds them to
[3:02:57] the reality of god it brings fear and
[3:03:00] anxiety and doubt instead of faith and
[3:03:02] the only cure for it is i have
[3:03:06] that is offered only in this age

[3:03:41] holes in the tent
[3:03:43] an old piece of canvas was put over and

[3:03:59] was a trapper and he kept the family in
[3:04:02] food and cooking the raccoons the fat
[3:04:04] would drip from the meat
[3:04:06] and his mama would save that
[3:04:08] and she would warm that grease
[3:04:11] and come up the ladder and rub
[3:04:13] grease in their eyes to soften the hard
[3:04:17] matter
[3:04:18] so they could see
[3:04:20] and brother branham said in the

[3:15:44] but voices made it understood
[3:15:48] the gentile ages
[3:15:51] ends with tongues let's get them started
[3:15:53] on something
[3:15:55] i'll preach all day
[3:15:57] gentile ages ended with tongues
[3:16:00] it's a sign of death
[3:16:03] that god is raining down the curtain
[3:16:08] and closing the gentile dispensation
[3:16:12] the tongues
[3:16:13] were a god
[3:16:17] the tongues was from god's own hand many
[3:16:20] many take on your farce
[3:16:23] tongues
[3:16:25] follow believers
[3:16:27] some of the signs
[3:16:29] the tongues weren't evil they were god
[3:16:31] they were declaring
[3:16:33] the end of satan's kingdom
[3:16:37] it is a sign of death to the kingdoms of
[3:16:39] the world
[3:16:40] you see tongues isn't the evidence of
[3:16:43] revival of that old system of religion
[3:16:46] it's the evidence of death it's a sign
[3:16:48] from god they have been weighed in the
[3:16:50] balance and found wanting
[3:16:53] but tongues of pentecost
[3:16:55] proclaimed
[3:16:59] the evidence that the ceremonial
[3:17:01] religion of the jews was over and a new
[3:17:03] era had begun
[3:17:05] and today
[3:17:08] the tongues
[3:17:11] it's ringing down the curtain on the
[3:17:12] gentile church ages and the gospel going
[3:17:15] back to the jews
[3:17:18] you see they call that a great revival
[3:17:21] among the
[3:17:22] a great spiritual move among the
[3:17:24] denominations they missed the boat the
[3:17:26] truth is it's the finish
[3:17:29] speaking in tongues is heralding the
[3:17:31] finish
[3:17:32] to all men's ideas and programs and
[3:17:34] kingdoms
[3:17:36] and the kingdom of our god is being
[3:17:38] ushered in
[3:17:39] [Music]
[3:17:46] and i don't mean if we speak in tongues
[3:17:47] it's a sign of death to us
[3:17:49] [Music]
[3:17:50] it's quickening power
[3:17:53] given life
[3:17:54] given power at work within you
[3:17:56] [Music]
[3:17:59] paul said when you do it you refresh
[3:18:01] yourself or edify yourself
