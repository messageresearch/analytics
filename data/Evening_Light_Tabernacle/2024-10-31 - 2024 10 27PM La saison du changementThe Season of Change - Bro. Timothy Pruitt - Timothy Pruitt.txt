thank you brother David the family for their care for us amen all the ones help with the preparation here I know what it's like to set up for meetings and things work goes into it the amen we just pray the Lord bless you amen God bless you Genesis 1 verse 14 and God said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the firment of the heaven to give light upon the Earth and it was so amen and God made two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day and the Lesser light to rule the night and he made the Stars also [Music] also down to verse verse 22 it says while the Earth remained sea time and harvest cold and heat summer and winter and day and night shall not cease verse 22 22 Yeah well that's what I got [Laughter] but anyway while the Earth remain it the seed time and [Music] harvest amen Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse one ecclesiast to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven amen God bless you you can be seated I like to speak to you this evening on the light the season of change amen a season is a a certain time appointed by God Amen it's appointed for a certain length of time and no human intellect can alter the time God has said amen the day gives place to the night and the night again to the day you ask the question is it summer well then it will be winter again is it winter stay a bit and the season will change it's showing that every purpose has its time and every time has it purpose cuz the cloud is the clearest Sky will become Cloudy and the most clouded Sky will clear up amen these things which to us just seem like another they are in the counsel and for knowledge of God they are determined by God the very hour of them is fix can't be delayed or extended amen as we could read in Ecclesiastes chapter there's a time to be born time to these are determined by the Divine counsil God we were born in this world and if time teares we but it's at an appointed time he said in Acts chapter 17 he has made of one blood all nations of men and he has determined the times that are appointed bounds of their habitation time to be born and a time to but there's also a time to rise again a set time of those that are in the grave will be remember job said it like this he said oh that thou would hide me in the grave that th would keep me until th wrath be thou would appoint me a set time and remember me we can go on there's a time to plant amen a certain season C that are for har if we can go on down to the script and there's many times for many things but the point is everything has a time and a season and and in your life there a higher power that is when it will Happ it will be will be finished amen just as the lights in heaven your father in Heaven and it changes the seasons amen we want things in our own time happen the way we want and it's a perfect time for every season of our so in order to fully experience what God has for us and you can have his peace St in your life you must accept appreciate the timing of God in your life amen God fulfills his word will in every individual's life in his own perfect time so we must give ourselves to we must give ourselves to God wants for our not what we desire to God wants us to amen there's four seasons in in the earth it's winter and spring and summer and fall every season has its purpose you know a winter season sometimes very loathsome or very boring gray and cloudy I know some of you love being I found out the French don't like being cold we're we're from the south of the United and it's very hot so we like our [Laughter] airon but I found some don't appreciate it as much I amen I said when you just stay a little bit you'll fall in love with air condition amen because we have Long Summers every one of them serves a purpose but you know in the gray winter time it's actually a time of in [Music] growth in trees and plants maybe you don't see nothing going seems like everything is dead but on the inside something is moving God is every good amen the spring time spring it's a time of transition it's a time of pruning off the soul rotates refreshing rain there a time of Joy glory after being dorant and through but it's a time when God shapes you and amen you know the summer is marked by this extreme heat there's need for more water than it's a time of needing more spiritual food true Christians season stronger amen Others May stumble deeper the God is using every season for because the fall is for Harvest Time expecting a harvest amen many times you know we love the as we say the mountain tops being up on the mountain amen sometimes we're down the valley hard trouble I'm here to tell you this evening is on the mountain God and he's working everything good so we must allow the season we're in to run his course God is a good god and let me let me just lay this in here for a moment it's always his intention it's always his desire to bless you despite the circumstances Hard Times uses them for his good perform his will in your life amen we can't change the season we're in but just as the day balances the that you walk through by God keep you balanced amen Paul had understanding of this he said I've learned that one state that I am where there with to be content I know to have I know what it's like to have nothing and I know what it's like to have but everywhere in all things I'm instructed that both to be full and to be hungry and whether I'm abounding or I'm having a need I can do all things Christ me amen so it determines what your source of power it's not Christ your seasons of your life will become they're far too heavy but if you can just hand them over to the learn to trust in his promise Le would say it like this hum yourself under the mighty hand of God might ex you in time so at the right time God will bring you out but no matter where you at for your good that's what the Bible says all things work together good to them that [Music] are hallelujah hallelujah amen so in other words in the right time the season will change it's easy to get discouraged when you're facing a difficult season of Life how quickly we begin to think man this this is going to last forever stuck here but if you if we believe we're in the hands of the who decre this seon then whatever season you're in amen see sometimes God doesn't try change your season he's trying to change your heart amen remember there's different seasons in our lives and we must let God do what he want every season of God is Sovereign he does what he pleases there isn't anything that happens to you I'm going to say that again there isn't anything that happens to you that catches God by surprise hallelujah hallelujah that should give us a lot of comfort God knew where I would be today still in control he's not only fully aware of the season of your but he has allowed for his glory see the psalm says it like this he does whatever pleases him in all the Heaven and the earth Isaiah would say it like this declaring the end from the beginning and from the ancient time things which have not been done say he says my purpose will be established and I will accomplish all my good pleasure so God Is With Us in every season of our and I want to get you this one God loves you if you're in a hard spot it's not because he doesn't if God loves you in the beginning love you at the end he do not change his he's not like a man who can love you one day God CH if God chose I he did [Applause] God loves you he will walk through you through every Darkness Rejoice with you time God will not send you on a hard path without him he is there with you he is helping you and as we heard the song even when you don't see him working even when you don't see nothing to his will so time is in God's hands for too many times we get frustrated with God because things are not happening on our you know we as humans intellect we got it all figured out we got we we know more somehow than the one who created us how is that possible hallelujah hallelujah somehow we get this idea than the one who created no no we are we in his timeline we think we know better so of course impatience you know depr but God is in so perfectly in control what you say brother Timothy about I mean I don't know what you're expect come on he's not back sitting off somewhere in the way Milky Way somewhere disconnected from this good luck see if you can make it see if you can make it no there in control of every situation working it according to his will the Rapture happen in God oh there's a lot of men that he well let me I'm going to use one of yours I know the time when God's coming do I need to translate that yeah yeah you woke up then I know the exact hour exact exact hour that he's coming the Bible said it's in the hour you think amen hallelujah hallelujah so no man can put a Time on God you better be here by as brother Tim was talking about you know a lot of people thought God how many remembers some of you do why 2K God's looking around like you know why God didn't come because there was more names on the he knew that in 20 at the beginning of 2020 there was a seed that was there that had had tried to do things his own to a amen and an angel tapped him on the shoulder Isaiah this is your time this is your moment pray for Dy pray I pray in 2024 can [Applause] tap you can be born it's youron amen amen we get frustrated though because how many is want a son need a has a prodal son or amen raise your hands brother Isaiah stand up look there there's a sign right there God brought him home God can bring yours home amen every done [Applause] before again he just need somebody to I'm ask you to go to my son my daughter Bible says in Ecclesiastes he has made everything beautiful amen Psalms 31 says my time is in your hands habac 2 says the vision is for an appointed time though it tees wait for it it will come to pass hallelujah hallelujah amen Galatians 6 says let us not be weary and well for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we don't give up hallelujah hallelujah but we go through seasons of Wai many times we find ourselves in a Seas of waiting and waiting for the Lord to C but in those Seasons God is there he's using those times as effectively as he uses a good time amen the time of waiting is not wasted hallelujah hallelujah so if you're waiting for a promise that's not a wasted time amen it says here in Isaiah 40 thou not known how th not heard that the Everlasting God the creator of the end and the Earth not neither his words but he giveth power to the F increases their strength that the youth will not F the young men not but they that wait upon amen this wait means it means wait in a place of Readiness or expectation something's going to happen it's not just sitting back like well maybe maybe maybe not they that wait you've been waiting for your son to come I think about theal son Jesus talked in the Bible when he came the Bible says he came and he was he was eating in a p yeah and and he he comes to himself and he said the servants have it better in my father's house so he starts making his way home father was waiting looking for his return the father saw him coming so he had been waiting if it ain't today tomorrow will down so you wait on the Lord under expectation and what you expect what you get amen Psalm says it like this wait for the Lord let your heart as the life seasons of life change no matter how much chaos surrounds you must stand firm on the word because God is faithful he keeps all of his promises he's always with us he will never AB he is our anchor our strength he never changes but he's changing us though the seasons change love for you Psalms 139 says like I'll read from a different translation Lord you know everything there is to know about me you perceive every moment of my heart you understand my every thought before it even enters my mind you are so intimately aware of me Lord you read in my heart like an open book and you know all the words I'm about to speak before I even start a s you know every step I will take before my Journey Begins and you have gone into my future to prepare my way Hallelujah don't worry about he's already there already in there to prepare you a prepared place am hallelujah hallelujah amen this is shouting ground you've gone into my future to prepare my way and you follow behind me to guard me from my past Hallelujah Glory you're talking about a God that's how can you lose cannot lose not God you Hallelujah you say well I got a bad path got a B God hallu he's got enough BL if you ask for forgiveness if you ask him to [Applause] forgive he REM so he's gone before you standing behind that makes me want to shout god with [Applause] [Applause] me and you have laid your hand on me this is just so wonderful and deep and incomprehensible your understanding of me it brings me wonder and strength where could I go to hide from your spirit where can I run and hide from your face I go to the heavens if I go to the dead you there if I fly with wings you are there if I see the sunset Wherever I Go your hand is guiding me it's impossible disappear from youall hallelujah amen this evening there might be great clowns hanging over here and trying to block out the ray of that don't you worry the sun's still there he still sees you he knows all about you he seen your struggle he seen your hurt he seen the words and he is here you's here you here you free Hallelujah God sees you he knows all about heard your hallelu you may have been in a season Hallelujah hallu Wherever I Go will [Applause] yes yes Hallelujah there's no such a thing as Darkness the night to you is as bright as the day Hallelujah you form my innermost being sh my delicate inside and you formed my outside and you wo it together in my mother's I thank you God for making me everything you do is marvelously breatht you formed every bone in my body you created me in the secret place skillfully you shap me from nothing something oh my oh my you saw who you created me to be before I became [Music] me before I ever seen the light of day the number of my days plan and they're already recorded your book every single moment you are thinking about me how precious and wonderful to consider that you cherish me thought when I wake each morning you are still with me so God is good in every season and in every season God is good and he cares for you even if it's been a hard life you don't know how to make sense out of it all he ain't up you ain't up for you to figure it all out already got it you can't add another day to your life but the devil can't take one away he's declared he's planed it is it is safe to trust God Amen so when it's your season to come for there's nothing can stop it it is a decree of God that's what we read in the Bible two lights up for the seasons and for the light here the Earth was without form it was a place of it was an empty space but God didn't leave it in that condition he desired to create an so able to bring a change he created light and light begin to change of the earth when light comes it changes things amen God has always used light to Mark a change it was Moses it was on the backs side of a desert he had tried things on his own one Egyptian and he escapes out into the Wilderness and he's back there tending some sheep on the back Bush and he CAU his attention he see this light bu and his burning not being burned so he goes before that light and out of that light speaks a voice meses see God knows who you are but he's want to show you [Applause] who and he begins to tell Moses I am the god of Abraham I want you to know something not just their God I'm your God I want you to go down tooh so Here Comes This coward before he gets to the light and he's got a rod a donkey a wife couple of children where you going Moses I'm going down to Egypt to take over what brought the change the light before the light he was a coward Army right up to their leader his finger in his face what brought it the light amen the light would lead them all the way through the Wilderness between as we said between them and the Egyptians and a voice spoke out and said the Egyptians you see today see no more forever what was in there a change of season what was declaring that change sea open they walked on the other side and the Egyptians thought well you know what that's good for them we'll go too that's good for them we'll go too so here they come with their and God's like come on I've been waiting a lot of years because before the foundation of World created that se and he had created those mountains put everything in his place y look at that look at that right there one day I'm going to bring my chosen right down through here show them let me build that mountain up over there just a little more what was he doing he was setting a trap for the en what is he doing in the time that we're living in he's allowed it to get worse till it comes to a point world but that fire is not for you amen he's setting a trap for his enemy en amen the Egyptians that you see today you see no more forever amen and here they came across the water fell upon the Egyptian but if you read the Bible it said they saw them floating in the Red Sea did he make a did he make a mistake I thought the Egyptian that you see today you see they wasn't the same Egyptians they were floating in the they didn't have no more breath in they couldn't pick up a whip no more they couldn't make them make one more they couldn't make them do one more thing their because the season had changed amen she sees the one who put on her back said I'm no longer a slave and it overcame her en oh if I can get you to realize against power but he is dead his back was broken child it'll make you rejo I'm no longer child [Applause] pornography what brings a change what brought the change in Mary little head to a well brother Rand said she had heard some things scripture Behold a virgin shall con see she was thinking about these things and he says you know about about that time he came he said does that when you're thinking about him you know I'd say there was a amber light the begin the world of stepped an angel began to speak to her tell who she was tell her what was going to happen made of the Mary maybe not felt that way felt pretty dejected God never speaks to you how you feel speak to you how his word says when he came to Gideon Gideon was hiding dressing some wheat and all of a sudden The Light Came said g that Mighty Man of [Music] vience come back here but God speak to you about your condition or your circumstance only speaks his word his [Applause] words so the light brought a change in her she didn't feel maybe nothing on her feelings but it was on what God had told her and she began to testify amen and brought said it brought a reproach he said but that didn't stop the beat of her heart they could call you whatever they want to call you they call you a Holy Roller amen it doesn't matter what they say it only matters what he said amen it was the light that brought the change the amen you had a bunch of cowards up there was a coward the last and up in the upper the atmosphere begin to change one down such a change he wasn't no more account but he could stand and preach a Ser Soul what brought the change it was a light Saul was on his road to the master he was going to put Believers in Chains but a light appeared and knocked him off his horse he who art thou Lord I am Jesus and the light changed he went from being a persecutor of the church to a messenger of the church
