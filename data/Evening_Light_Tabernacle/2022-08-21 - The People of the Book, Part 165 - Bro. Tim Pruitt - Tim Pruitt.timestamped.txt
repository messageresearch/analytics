[42:46] today from brother eric wilson from
[42:49] south africa
[42:50] and now these uh i just want to explain
[42:53] a little bit about them you know they
[42:55] are they're people that have a church
[42:57] that they support and
[42:59] and minister at
[43:01] and they're not a part of a personality
[43:03] cult
[43:04] we don't receive any money from them but
[43:07] after their service is over they just
[43:09] like to come and be a part of the
[43:11] worldwide audience as we
[43:14] edify the body of christ and i just want
[43:17] you to see the impact that you're having
[43:20] upon people around the world and
[43:22] families and churches and and others and
[43:25] while i'm doing this let me just take
[43:27] before i play his
[43:28] his um greetings and testimony today i
[43:31] want to greet brother buzz bozey a
[43:34] pastor and missionary to uganda
[43:37] and ethiopia he's listening in with his
[43:39] family today and they send their
[43:41] greetings to you
[43:42] and the audience here that
[43:44] is listening in
[43:46] and also greetings to pastor john gosam
[43:49] from ghana who's also a part of our
[43:52] audience
[43:53] and listens to every service these are
[43:56] pastors men of god
[43:58] many of them have been ministers for
[43:59] many years
[44:00] but um they
[44:03] they
[44:04] are edified and built up and
[44:06] strengthened and encouraged by the
[44:08] ministry and by the word the lord and by
[44:11] your worship to god
[44:13] and
[44:14] so also there
[44:16] no doubt today down in south texas
[44:19] brother buster wiggins and the saints
[44:21] there we'd like to greet them
[44:24] as they um are without a pastor in that
[44:27] little small work in that area they're
[44:29] part of our audience and those down in
[44:32] beaumont as well and different other
[44:34] places or shut-ins like brother and
[44:37] sister hollis are listening in so we can
[44:39] send greetings to you brother and sister
[44:41] hollis we love you and
[44:43] look forward to the time she told me the
[44:45] other day brother tim we want to try to
[44:47] get together and just come back to
[44:49] church one more time at least once more
[44:52] amen so
[44:53] they're they're wonderful people we love
[44:55] them
[44:56] and appreciate them and then there are
[44:59] other elderly and other states unable to
[45:01] attend church like brother bill sister
[45:03] johnny mayo that we baptized recently
[45:06] and they join with us forever service so
[45:09] we send greetings to them
[45:11] and
[45:12] you know i i think of sometimes
[45:15] um you know the impact that we can have
[45:18] upon the bride of christ worldwide
[45:21] and the responsibility that we have of
[45:23] taking the message around the world
[45:27] and as many times people will say well
[45:30] what about the missionary outreach well
[45:32] we do missionary outreach but this in
[45:34] itself
[45:35] is a missionary outreach i can preach in
[45:38] this pulpit
[45:39] and minister to more people than if i
[45:42] flew overseas and preached in a
[45:44] convention
[45:45] and uh you know when reaching many
[45:47] different places and uh and and did uh
[45:51] and and reached out into different
[45:54] places away
[45:55] from from this very pulpit but anyway my
[45:58] thoughts go to a little sister in
[46:00] england she's now deceased
[46:02] but one day they were down praying her
[46:04] and her friend knew nothing of the
[46:06] message
[46:07] and they were just down praying and
[46:09] the spirit of god fell upon the man and
[46:12] the holy spirit spoke and said the deep
[46:15] calleth unto the deep
[46:18] and and
[46:20] you know after prayer they looked at
[46:22] each other and said well what does that
[46:23] mean
[46:24] so they looked in the bible and they
[46:26] found
[46:27] you know in the bible the deep calls to
[46:29] the deep and then they put it in the
[46:31] internet you know uh deep cult to the
[46:34] deep
[46:35] and uh that led them to um to brother
[46:39] bischo's church
[46:41] and
[46:41] and so as they
[46:44] tuned in that day i was preaching
[46:47] and so they took my name and they began
[46:50] to follow me everywhere that i
[46:52] ministered and preached and back home in
[46:54] our own home pulpit and they would stay
[46:56] up till two o'clock in the morning just
[46:58] to tune in and listen
[47:01] and um you know so
[47:04] again those are souls that we would have
[47:06] never reached
[47:10] except that god has made a way that that
[47:13] the gospel could go into all the world
[47:15] by means of the internet and so
[47:19] this is what ends up blessing the people
[47:21] this now this sister's done going on to
[47:23] be with the lord
[47:24] but you know who knows the impact
[47:27] that we we will have
[47:30] on that day when we will meet people and
[47:32] realize
[47:33] that we have a positive influence
[47:36] upon others lives and their lives were
[47:39] changed because of the gospel of jesus
[47:41] christ so i'm going to let brother um
[47:45] brother
[47:46] eric wilson from south africa i think
[47:49] he's from the cape area that he's going
[47:52] to greet you now and and speak to you i
[47:55] just thought it was noteworthy and asked
[47:57] his permission can i can i let the
[47:59] church hear you speak today so
[48:02] brother
[48:03] eric god bless you and your wife and
[48:05] children and the saints that are
[48:07] gathered there with you tonight
[48:10] because it's night over there god bless
[48:11] you
[48:12] amen
[48:15] good afternoon pastor pruitt god bless
[48:18] you
[48:19] this is brother eddie from psalms at
[48:21] west cape town
[48:22] it is a good day today god is good to us
[48:25] and he has been very faithful
[48:28] many times we tend to be unfaithful but
[48:30] it's because of the faithfulness of god
[48:32] that we are life and wealth
[48:34] we really thank god for his grace and
[48:38] for his mercy and for the change that
[48:40] he's brought in our lives
[48:42] we were just today we were in church and
[48:45] we had a great time in the presence of
[48:47] god and the anointing of god and how god
[48:50] touched the people in church
[48:53] and i was reminded of what you said to
[48:55] me a few months ago that
[48:58] it is not the monastery that packs the
[49:00] revival in his suitcase
[49:03] wherever you are god can wherever you
[49:06] are god can actually use you through you
[49:09] i mean if you you you the person that
[49:11] it's the people that brings the revival
[49:13] and
[49:13] this morning we saw how god brought
[49:15] about the revival in our church in
[49:18] amongst the people
[49:20] and i'm very sure and convinced that
[49:23] it is where you eat and how you eat the
[49:26] word that's been ministered to you the
[49:28] five-fold ministry of god that is
[49:30] edifying us as us people here in south
[49:33] africa
[49:34] and uh it's amazing the the other night
[49:37] we we went for the youth meeting and
[49:40] brother aaron he ministered at evening
[49:42] light tabernacle and you know the the
[49:45] the the message that he brought was so
[49:49] inspiring it it touched my heart to such
[49:51] an extent that i said lord how can i
[49:54] preach this to the people and i said
[49:56] lord
[49:57] let me just play the video and all of us
[50:00] the young people we would listen and
[50:02] the presence of god came down and you
[50:05] just see all the young people
[50:07] going to the altar and desiring prayer
[50:10] and desiring a touch from god
[50:12] and god is so good to us
[50:14] this week we were inside and
[50:17] two o'clock in the morning we woke up
[50:19] with the songs and praises
[50:22] and then we realized it was a children
[50:24] that's actually streaming the young
[50:26] people
[50:27] and the convention that they have the
[50:29] meetings that the young people have it
[50:31] is so amazing and it's so wonderful to
[50:34] know that
[50:35] the change that god brought about in our
[50:38] people's lives and last week we were
[50:41] listening to your message as you
[50:43] preached and we had a family here and we
[50:45] had the pastor's wife over here and the
[50:48] people they could not even they didn't
[50:50] want to go because of the the presence
[50:52] of almighty god and you realize that how
[50:55] great god is and and what god is doing
[50:58] for us
[50:59] and my heart is once again so thankful
[51:02] and
[51:03] and and so overwhelmed to know that
[51:06] god has brought us to a place where we
[51:09] can listen to messages from evening
[51:12] light tabernacle and people that is
[51:14] theirs and i don't want you to take it
[51:16] wrong but it's role models when we look
[51:18] at the young people we it's role models
[51:21] when we look at the ministers where we
[51:23] can say lord god that's what you've done
[51:26] in their life we want that life we want
[51:29] that god that's in them that's changed
[51:31] them and you can actually see the
[51:33] difference that's what we desire
[51:36] and this is what god has graciously
[51:38] granted to us that we can only go and
[51:41] say thank you lord for your grace and
[51:43] for your mercies we see
[51:45] the change in our people and we see
[51:48] you know how they worshipping god the
[51:50] way the young people worshipping god and
[51:53] the the
[51:54] the life they start to live and and how
[51:56] god has changed us we really want to
[51:58] thank god for you
[52:00] and thank you and the ministers at
[52:03] evening light tabernacle for availing
[52:05] yourself
[52:07] for god to work through you
[52:09] god bless you richly and we really
[52:11] appreciate you all
[52:13] and we're looking forward to the service
[52:15] we we're preparing ourselves looking
[52:17] forward
[52:18] because it's something that we cannot
[52:19] miss
[52:20] god is really touching us god bless you
[52:23] all greet the family and greet the
[52:24] church amen
[52:33] hallelujah you see it isn't about us for
[52:36] no more
[52:37] it is not even is not at all about a
[52:40] personality cult that you follow after
[52:42] it's getting in love with jesus
[52:44] amen and and serving the lord with all
[52:47] of your heart and so we greet all of
[52:49] these brethrens wherever they are and i
[52:51] know there's many many more and i'm
[52:53] sorry i i can't um call every name and
[52:56] every person um because um you know
[52:59] there's even there has even been those
[53:01] that have asked me brother tim you know
[53:03] when you preach well you just call my
[53:04] name too
[53:06] amen but we love you and we appreciate
[53:09] you and and we thank the lord for what
[53:11] he's doing in lives and hearts and
[53:14] around the world and you see like i said
[53:17] it's not just about us
[53:19] it's about a bride around the world
[53:23] as a as he said he'd have a bride out of
[53:26] every nation kindred tongue
[53:29] tribe or people
[53:30] now you know many of these that well
[53:34] just about many of most all of these
[53:36] that i've mentioned especially from
[53:38] overseas i've never even met never had
[53:41] the privilege to shake their hand
[53:43] but you know god has stirred their
[53:46] hearts and moving in their lives and and
[53:48] in some way we can be an oak tree and a
[53:51] little bit of encouragement for them to
[53:53] be able to take and find rest under our
[53:56] shape for a little bit
[53:58] and uh help them in life's journey uh to
[54:01] be a greater christian to be ready for
[54:04] the coming of the lord you say well
[54:05] brother tim why would you even be
[54:07] interested in anybody else but your own
[54:09] little group and only all because you
[54:12] see if god has a people
[54:15] and they are people out of every kindred
[54:18] tongue tribe and nation
[54:20] well uh no matter how rapture ready that
[54:23] i am
[54:25] i can't go without them
[54:27] so therefore i want to see them dressed
[54:30] in the word of god and and walking in
[54:34] with god like enoch walked with god's i
[54:36] have an interest in other people and
[54:39] other needs and you know there are there
[54:41] is great mission work that is can be
[54:44] done and every bit of your mission money
[54:46] that you give and and whatever we put in
[54:49] a mission fund and i don't always tell
[54:51] you where it goes but it goes for the
[54:53] work of the lord we have done different
[54:56] things with it um printing books um
[54:59] right now we're still
[55:01] just regularly getting
[55:03] maybe two sermons a week in in the
[55:06] japanese language that is now going on
[55:08] the message hub
[55:10] where you know where there were there
[55:11] was nothing there and now the message is
[55:14] going there
[55:15] and we're just now supporting our
[55:17] missionary brother danny del mundo to go
[55:20] into japan there and hold some services
[55:23] so you know it's going to be some
[55:25] tremendous times that they're looking
[55:27] forward to and we've uh we've helped to
[55:30] to get those tickets and
[55:32] and finance some of that because you
[55:35] know right now it takes three shots to
[55:37] go into
[55:38] japan
[55:39] and uh you know other stringent
[55:42] regulations so they're just now barely
[55:45] opening up you got to have a shot and a
[55:47] booster and a booster and um you know
[55:50] right now i don't even feel like being
[55:52] boosted
[55:54] and so you know you know
[55:56] if you can't go you send someone
[55:59] and so we have confidence in brother
[56:01] danny del mundo from the philippines to
[56:03] go over there and to share the word of
[56:05] god and they also listen in many times
[56:07] to the services of god bless them too
[56:11] now so again you know we were speaking
[56:13] about being an oak tree i just wanted
[56:15] you to just get a little glimpse
[56:18] you know just a little window into some
[56:20] of the lives there and the situations
[56:23] and needs and and the hearts that are
[56:26] being touched
[56:27] now today i'm going to be speaking on a
[56:29] restored tree
[56:31] with restored fruits
[56:34] and
[56:35] as and some of this i'm going to
[56:38] reiterate and i'm going to
[56:41] expand and expound upon and uh so don't
[56:45] feel like that i'm old and have
[56:46] alzheimer's and forgot what i preached
[56:48] before
[56:49] uh or didn't have time to study because
[56:52] i put a lot of effort into this
[56:55] and um so
[56:56] we we daily just commit ourselves to the
[56:59] lord and to the study of the word and
[57:02] and uh those that know me know that i
[57:05] spend countless of hours into that
[57:07] because i i want to be right
[57:10] and i want you prepared to meet the lord
[57:13] and the appearance of god in this last
[57:16] day of course we know will
[57:18] will be under the bride tree
[57:21] amen and it's not a leafless tree but
[57:23] it's a tree where the holy spirit is
[57:25] welcomed
[57:26] where saints run to meet him and bow to
[57:29] worship him
[57:31] but to do this we must have a restored
[57:33] tree
[57:34] under whose shade jehovah comes to abide
[57:39] now i'd like to just get a couple of
[57:41] more scriptures that we have read but
[57:43] just to just place where we're at in the
[57:46] bible so joel 1 and 4
[57:48] that which the palmer worm is left at
[57:51] the locust eaten that which the locust
[57:53] has left have to can't go where i'm
[57:54] eating that which the canker worm is
[57:57] left have the caterpillar eaten then
[57:59] verse 25 of chapter two and i will
[58:02] restore to you
[58:03] the years that the locust has eaten the
[58:06] kenko worm the caterpillar and the
[58:07] palmer worm my great army which i sent
[58:09] among you
[58:10] and you shall eat in plenty and be
[58:12] satisfied and praise the name of the
[58:14] lord your god that it dealt wondrously
[58:17] with you and my people shall never be
[58:19] ashamed
[58:20] then i would like to bring a couple of
[58:22] verses out of psalms 80 and verse 8
[58:25] thou has brought a vine out of egypt
[58:28] thou has cast out the heathen and
[58:30] planted it
[58:31] thou has prepared a room before it and
[58:35] did his cause it to take deep root and
[58:38] it filled the land
[58:39] now like i said i i didn't really finish
[58:42] my thought last sunday of under the oak
[58:45] tree and
[58:46] and i'm going to go back over some
[58:48] points clarify some things or make it
[58:50] more clear rather more than clarify
[58:53] because i didn't say anything wrong that
[58:55] i found but the israel was a vine
[58:59] that could never be fruitful until it
[59:01] was planted
[59:03] back into his promised land of
[59:05] inheritance
[59:07] and until then it would just produce
[59:10] the naughty fruits and bitter fruits of
[59:13] slavery
[59:14] now brother branham tells us in
[59:16] gabriel's instruction to daniel he said
[59:19] god never dealt with israel till she
[59:21] came to her
[59:22] her homeland
[59:24] and hear me thus saith the lord
[59:27] god will not deal with the church till
[59:29] she comes back to the homeland
[59:32] the message of the hour come back to the
[59:35] original get away from your methodist
[59:37] baptist presbyterian ideas your
[59:40] pentecostal assemblies oneness threeness
[59:42] fiveness whatever it is church god
[59:44] nazarene pilgrim holiness church of
[59:46] christ all antichrist movement and i
[59:49] realize this strikes the world all wrong
[59:51] all of the devil there's godly men and
[59:54] every one of them godly people and every
[59:56] one of them movements by the way you
[59:58] were there
[1:00:00] but you got pulled out of there by
[1:00:02] hearing the voices that come out of her
[1:00:04] my people
[1:00:05] there's godly men and every one of them
[1:00:07] godly people and every one of them
[1:00:09] movements but the organization in itself
[1:00:11] is not of god and god will never bless
[1:00:14] it he never has done it
[1:00:16] so you see you know there are many
[1:00:19] things that has um that kind of gets
[1:00:22] mixed with the message satan is a great
[1:00:24] hybrider
[1:00:25] he always comes along and when the
[1:00:28] original comes he comes along and tries
[1:00:31] to figure out a way to hybrid it by
[1:00:33] bringing in the creeds and ideas of
[1:00:36] other past movements
[1:00:38] and try to mix it and you know
[1:00:40] cross-pollinate and try to
[1:00:43] you know mix up the fruit and so it's a
[1:00:45] baptist creed to say that you receive
[1:00:48] the holy ghost when you believe the
[1:00:50] message
[1:00:51] and it is it's the same as it is and the
[1:00:54] zoos of pentecostal creed to say you
[1:00:56] receive the holy ghost when you shout
[1:00:58] dance or speak in tongues
[1:01:00] you see all of that is incorrect and you
[1:01:02] will never grow
[1:01:05] real christ-like fruit in that kind of
[1:01:08] soil
[1:01:09] you must be planted in the homeland
[1:01:12] and the homeland is the word of god
[1:01:16] not many people are afraid of being
[1:01:17] identified it seems like it's really
[1:01:20] taboo and i understand why but you know
[1:01:22] to be identified as an azusa pentecostal
[1:01:25] branch so
[1:01:26] and you know in
[1:01:28] in opposition to that they become a
[1:01:30] baptist branch which is a whole lot less
[1:01:33] scriptural and several church changes
[1:01:36] behind the azusa vine
[1:01:38] you know we but we want to be neither a
[1:01:41] baptist branch or an azusa branch
[1:01:45] because those with that fruit will be
[1:01:48] cut off
[1:01:49] amen and it'll be thrown into the fire
[1:01:52] of tribulation we want to be the
[1:01:55] original genuine branch as the church as
[1:02:00] it was on the day of pentecost
[1:02:03] to receive of the blessings and the
[1:02:05] fullness of god for a rapture we must be
[1:02:08] planted in the homeland of the open book
[1:02:12] and the fullness of the word that came
[1:02:14] by its opening
[1:02:17] now in gabriel's instructions to daniel
[1:02:19] brother branham tells again god never
[1:02:22] blesses israel until she gets out of her
[1:02:24] homeland he'll never bless you as a
[1:02:26] baptist or methodist or presbyterian
[1:02:29] catholic or pilgrim holiness nazarene
[1:02:31] church of god pentecostal organization
[1:02:33] will never bless you that way come back
[1:02:35] to the homeland to the beginning back to
[1:02:39] the pentecostal experience
[1:02:41] like happened on the day of pentecost
[1:02:43] when the power of the living god changed
[1:02:46] those thousands of people and set their
[1:02:48] hearts aflame with the fire of god that
[1:02:51] showed genuine not impersonating signs
[1:02:54] not made up telepathy not some mockery
[1:02:58] he goes on to say he wants us back to
[1:03:00] the truth back to the spirit back to the
[1:03:03] right life back to the highway in christ
[1:03:07] back to truth how can he bless us the
[1:03:10] way we go he won't he never blessed
[1:03:12] israel until they came back to the
[1:03:14] promised land and when they got back in
[1:03:17] the promised land signs of wonders begin
[1:03:19] to happen
[1:03:22] hallelujah
[1:03:23] again he he says in the 70th week back
[1:03:27] to the message brother back to the the
[1:03:29] original back to pentecost back to the
[1:03:32] real blessing back to the name of jesus
[1:03:34] christ back to the baptism of the holy
[1:03:37] ghost baptist signs and wonders back to
[1:03:39] pentecost away with organizations back
[1:03:42] to the holy ghost
[1:03:44] so these are things that he would
[1:03:47] would become a theme of his and he would
[1:03:50] integrate and reintegrate over and over
[1:03:53] again
[1:03:54] now let us review psalms 80 and verse 7
[1:03:57] again and i just want to look at some of
[1:04:00] this as we go along because i think it's
[1:04:03] as brother braden preached from this on
[1:04:05] planting the vine and word of planet
[1:04:07] that he uses this scripture and he
[1:04:09] places us right here in these in these
[1:04:13] verses
[1:04:14] so i want you just to see it it says
[1:04:16] restore to us
[1:04:18] or turn again
[1:04:20] oh god a host god almighty make your
[1:04:23] face to shine upon us that we may be
[1:04:26] saved
[1:04:27] you transplanted a vine from his from
[1:04:30] egypt you drove out the nations and you
[1:04:33] you planted it and then he said you
[1:04:36] cleared the ground for it it took root
[1:04:38] and it filled the land the mountains
[1:04:40] were covered with its shades
[1:04:42] mighty cedars with its branches the
[1:04:45] its branches reached as far as the sea
[1:04:48] it shoots as far as the river why have
[1:04:50] you broken down its walls so that all
[1:04:52] that passed by to pick its greats bores
[1:04:55] from the forest ravages and insects from
[1:04:58] the fields that's the cankle worm the
[1:05:00] caterpillar the palma worm and the
[1:05:02] locust is eat it's fed on it
[1:05:05] and and devours it return unto us oh god
[1:05:09] almighty amen look down from the heavens
[1:05:13] and see what's over this line
[1:05:16] the root of your right hand now notice
[1:05:19] right hand is power so the hand of your
[1:05:22] power
[1:05:23] and he said has planted so your hand
[1:05:26] of power has planted the root
[1:05:30] the sun you raised up for yourself now
[1:05:32] the root was christ
[1:05:35] so god through his power raised up
[1:05:38] christ
[1:05:39] and and he is the son that god raised up
[1:05:44] and god planted this tree and he is
[1:05:46] determined to have a family to have
[1:05:50] branches on his vine
[1:05:53] he is the root
[1:05:56] and he's going to have branches
[1:05:58] and remember it's not the root bearing
[1:06:00] the fruit is the branches bearing the
[1:06:03] fruit
[1:06:05] so now he goes on to say because of them
[1:06:08] being taken down to babylon and the and
[1:06:11] the because of their sins your vine is
[1:06:13] cut down it is burned with fire you're
[1:06:16] at your rebuke to be your people perish
[1:06:19] and um so like israel the church was cut
[1:06:22] down
[1:06:23] all the way
[1:06:25] to mystery babylon
[1:06:28] so i want you to think the same thing is
[1:06:30] happening now to israel happens to the
[1:06:32] church
[1:06:33] they were hauled down to babylon
[1:06:36] but the church has been hauled down to
[1:06:38] mystery babylon
[1:06:40] so you see her in the in the book of
[1:06:43] revelation say and he is saying come out
[1:06:45] of her my people it's the call to come
[1:06:47] back to the homeland
[1:06:50] now so he says again but because he says
[1:06:53] i will restore and here he tells us how
[1:06:56] he's going to do it
[1:06:57] now he has talked about restoration in
[1:07:00] all of these verses but now he's going
[1:07:02] to tell how he's going to do it verse 17
[1:07:05] let your hand
[1:07:07] your power
[1:07:08] rest upon the man of at your right hand
[1:07:12] the son of man that you have raised up
[1:07:15] for yourself
[1:07:16] so the son of man is the holy spirit
[1:07:20] you see it's the prophet of the hour
[1:07:22] that anointed the seventh angel to
[1:07:24] prophesy and the same holy spirit makes
[1:07:28] us prophesy again
[1:07:30] so god's power would be upon the prophet
[1:07:33] notice it would be the power of god upon
[1:07:36] the prophet
[1:07:37] and the prophet is a prophetic anointing
[1:07:40] he himself is not a prophet he's a son
[1:07:42] of man revealing the son of man so now
[1:07:45] notice it's a god's power now upon the
[1:07:48] prophet and the church who is a
[1:07:50] prophetical class of people
[1:07:53] now for this restoration is gonna have
[1:07:56] to be more than a reformation
[1:07:58] it will take a prophetic anointing
[1:08:02] the son of man christ would manifest
[1:08:05] itself for himself as a prophetic
[1:08:09] anointing
[1:08:10] and that's a particular anointing
[1:08:14] now i want you to i want you to get it
[1:08:16] because it is an anointing when you look
[1:08:19] at the elijah ministry that's the
[1:08:22] anointing of christ upon a ministry when
[1:08:25] you see again an elisha group that
[1:08:28] follows elijah
[1:08:30] come on
[1:08:31] that is the ministry of christ
[1:08:33] continuing on
[1:08:35] again when you look at revelation 10
[1:08:38] uh
[1:08:39] revelation 10 1 the mighty angel that is
[1:08:42] an anointing coming down
[1:08:45] that is not that is not the physical
[1:08:48] return of christ it is his anointing
[1:08:50] coming down to produce a work of
[1:08:54] restoration in the last days so again i
[1:08:57] want to i want to just give you a few
[1:08:59] snippets now i'm going to use a lot of
[1:09:01] snippets as it was because i can't read
[1:09:03] all the quotes in in their context but
[1:09:05] i'm going to just pull out
[1:09:07] you know just a few little sentences
[1:09:09] here and there and i'll let you know but
[1:09:11] this is what i'm we are expecting that
[1:09:13] great anointing upon the church that
[1:09:15] will turn the hearts back to the
[1:09:18] original doctrine
[1:09:20] of the father's back to real genuine
[1:09:23] pentecost
[1:09:24] again he says because we find in the
[1:09:27] scripture in malachi 4 that there is to
[1:09:29] be an anointing come down and to restore
[1:09:32] that original faith and to bring the
[1:09:35] faith of the people back to the original
[1:09:37] pentecost the faith of the fathers
[1:09:40] again he says to restore what the faith
[1:09:43] of the people back to the original
[1:09:45] fathers the pentecostal doctrine the
[1:09:48] original fathers and he will restore the
[1:09:51] people back to the fathers
[1:09:54] so understand the anointing of christ
[1:09:57] would be called the spirit of elijah
[1:10:00] that was the spirit of christ
[1:10:02] upon elijah
[1:10:04] amen upon elisha upon john the baptist
[1:10:08] a man upon william branham brother
[1:10:11] branham
[1:10:12] amen
[1:10:13] upon the elijah to the jews it wouldn't
[1:10:16] be a reincarnation
[1:10:18] of a man nor his spirit but the spirit
[1:10:21] of the lord that was identified with
[1:10:23] elijah as he turned the hearts of the
[1:10:26] children back or the hearts of israel
[1:10:29] back to the faith in jehovah again
[1:10:32] now this elijah would have a job of
[1:10:35] restoration
[1:10:37] remember it would be done through this
[1:10:40] through the man
[1:10:42] that right hand upon a man your hand of
[1:10:45] power upon a man he would be a son of
[1:10:49] man he would be we call him in this the
[1:10:51] scripture the son of man but so this son
[1:10:54] of man is christ so just to make sure
[1:10:56] you understand it's a son of man
[1:10:59] but again it is the manifestation of the
[1:11:02] spirit of christ for our day
[1:11:05] now and so you see the elijah would have
[1:11:08] a job of restoration like the original
[1:11:12] elijah
[1:11:15] so talk with me to first kings 18
[1:11:18] let's look at verse 30 and elijah said
[1:11:21] unto the all the people
[1:11:22] come near unto me and the people came
[1:11:25] near unto him and he repaired the altar
[1:11:28] of the lord that was broken down
[1:11:30] and elijah took 12 stones according to
[1:11:33] the number of the tribes
[1:11:35] of the of the sons of jacob up upon
[1:11:39] unto whom the word the lord came saying
[1:11:41] israel shall be thy name
[1:11:44] and with stones he built the stones he
[1:11:47] built an altar in the name of the lord
[1:11:49] he made a treats about the altar as
[1:11:52] greatest would contain two measures of
[1:11:54] seed now i want you just to look back at
[1:11:57] verse 30 and i want you to see he
[1:12:00] prepared or he repaired the altar
[1:12:05] he did not build a new altar
[1:12:11] he did not bring a new doctrine
[1:12:18] now the message we have received is not
[1:12:22] something new
[1:12:24] it is the doctrine of the apostles and
[1:12:27] prophets it is what paul preached
[1:12:33] brother tim we have more than what old
[1:12:35] paul preached no we don't
[1:12:38] this is a restoration
[1:12:41] back to the faith of the fathers
[1:12:44] we do not have a message different from
[1:12:47] paul
[1:12:48] that would place us under a curse
[1:12:51] see galatians 1 and 8 says though we are
[1:12:54] an angel from heaven preach any other
[1:12:56] gospel
[1:12:58] unto you than that which we have
[1:12:59] received uh preached and you let him be
[1:13:03] a curse
[1:13:05] and athema
[1:13:07] amen so as we've said before now here
[1:13:09] comes the double curse of galatians 1 9
[1:13:12] now the devil curse as we said before
[1:13:14] say so say i now again if any man preach
[1:13:18] any other gospel unto you than that
[1:13:20] which you'll receive let him be accursed
[1:13:25] so there is a double curse
[1:13:28] upon people who who are preached
[1:13:31] something different than what paul
[1:13:34] preached
[1:13:36] now so there can be
[1:13:38] no additions
[1:13:40] or any subtractions to the bible
[1:13:45] amen
[1:13:46] revelation 20 22 18 for i testify unto
[1:13:50] every man that heareth the words of the
[1:13:52] prophecy of this book if any man shall
[1:13:54] add to these things
[1:13:56] god shall add to him the plagues that
[1:13:58] are written in this book and if any man
[1:14:01] shall take away from the words of this
[1:14:03] book of prophecy say christ isn't the
[1:14:05] same say days of miracles are passed say
[1:14:08] you know we don't get the holy ghost
[1:14:10] like they did on the day of pentecost
[1:14:12] all of these say god shall take his part
[1:14:15] out of the book of life and out of the
[1:14:18] holy city and from the things that are
[1:14:21] written in this book
[1:14:24] my it's a it is an
[1:14:26] absolute curse
[1:14:29] to preach anything different one from
[1:14:31] what paul preached
[1:14:34] come on
[1:14:35] now i granted there were symbols in the
[1:14:37] book of revelation and yeah it wasn't
[1:14:40] understood unto this day what those
[1:14:42] symbols were
[1:14:44] so we do understand things that paul
[1:14:47] didn't understand one thing he i say he
[1:14:51] didn't understand he didn't even know
[1:14:52] about it because the book of revelation
[1:14:54] would be written after he was gone
[1:14:57] so it would be the last book because it
[1:14:59] would be added into
[1:15:01] as on the the end of the bible because
[1:15:04] it would be for our day
[1:15:07] so we do understand things that paul
[1:15:09] didn't like the mystery of the seven
[1:15:11] stars
[1:15:13] you know the meaning of the seven cities
[1:15:15] the seven golden candlesticks you see
[1:15:18] paul didn't know that would be seven
[1:15:20] church ages
[1:15:21] i mean he fully expected the lord to
[1:15:23] come in his age in his time he said say
[1:15:26] we which are alive and remain
[1:15:29] amen the mystery of the seven thunders
[1:15:32] which are the mysteries contained in the
[1:15:33] seven seals and when they were open it
[1:15:36] revealed the symbols of each of each
[1:15:38] seal
[1:15:39] right
[1:15:40] but this never i won't just get
[1:15:43] something clear this did not give us new
[1:15:46] doctrine
[1:15:48] we did not receive a different gospel
[1:15:53] amen paul amen paul did not
[1:15:56] what paul preached was the pure word of
[1:15:58] god
[1:15:59] but man had lost it
[1:16:02] that's why it got sealed up
[1:16:05] and that's why we needed it open
[1:16:08] because the opening was to restore the
[1:16:11] abstract to the title deed that we had
[1:16:13] lost
[1:16:15] because we went down to babylon
[1:16:18] and about we down through the dark ages
[1:16:22] are you with me
[1:16:24] now so paul
[1:16:26] you see
[1:16:27] paul
[1:16:28] had a gospel i'm going to go through
[1:16:30] this and some of this may be elementary
[1:16:32] but i want to i want to pound it in make
[1:16:35] sure you really
[1:16:36] know what we believe because we do not
[1:16:40] believe some
[1:16:41] off-the-wall teachings
[1:16:44] that just came from the mind of a
[1:16:46] kentucky preacher
[1:16:48] we
[1:16:49] it was not his intellectual property it
[1:16:52] was um the mysteries of god revealed by
[1:16:55] an angel
[1:16:57] because of an anointing that was on him
[1:16:59] of elijah the prophet to bring a
[1:17:02] restoration and to give the old stones
[1:17:05] of truth that had been lost and
[1:17:07] neglected and repaired the altar
[1:17:10] [Applause]
[1:17:13] hallelujah
[1:17:15] amen
[1:17:17] now so you see
[1:17:20] brother branham taught water baptism as
[1:17:23] paul taught it
[1:17:25] he taught
[1:17:26] the holy ghost as an experience just the
[1:17:30] way paul taught it
[1:17:32] paul came to ephesus and he found
[1:17:34] believers
[1:17:35] people who had believed
[1:17:38] and asked if they
[1:17:39] if they had yet experienced the holy
[1:17:41] ghost since they had believed and paul
[1:17:44] insisted you must have an experience
[1:17:47] after believing
[1:17:49] not upon believing
[1:17:51] that you get the holy ghost but after
[1:17:53] you believe you were sealed with the
[1:17:54] holy ghost
[1:17:55] this holy spirit of promise
[1:17:57] now so again all of these things paul
[1:18:00] preached them
[1:18:02] in fact when brother brown goes beyond
[1:18:04] the curtain of time what was that that
[1:18:06] rejoiced his heart
[1:18:07] they told him there you have preached
[1:18:09] what paul preached
[1:18:12] oh you say well brother tim he got that
[1:18:14] in 1916 that's when he he went there no
[1:18:18] he was there and you know that's when he
[1:18:20] entered in
[1:18:22] in
[1:18:23] 1965
[1:18:24] one breath away he's gathered with all
[1:18:27] of these people
[1:18:30] amen because he said he was so he was
[1:18:33] showed this it was not a vision it was a
[1:18:35] translation he was caught up into the
[1:18:37] eternals and he saw what it would be
[1:18:39] when he
[1:18:40] when he was gathered with his people
[1:18:42] in plain language when he died and when
[1:18:45] he would die he was gathered with all of
[1:18:47] them and they said you preach what paul
[1:18:49] preached
[1:18:56] he declared it i preached what paul
[1:18:58] preached and they said
[1:19:00] we know that
[1:19:02] and we're resting on that
[1:19:08] i'll tell you if that's their rest here
[1:19:11] that's got to be a rest here
[1:19:15] hallelujah
[1:19:17] now let me let me just get clear here
[1:19:19] let's talk about paul and his gospel
[1:19:21] because paul said men would be judged by
[1:19:24] his gospel
[1:19:26] in romans 2 16 he said in the day when
[1:19:29] god shall judge the secrets of men by
[1:19:31] jesus christ according to my gospel
[1:19:36] and paul began to take this and he said
[1:19:38] it is my gospel
[1:19:42] you know why he was recognizing himself
[1:19:44] as a messenger
[1:19:46] the apostle to the gentiles which is the
[1:19:49] apostle to all the church ages
[1:19:52] so he said he said his gospel
[1:19:55] was
[1:19:56] he said his gospel was a revelation of
[1:19:59] the mystery that had been hid from the
[1:20:02] foundational world and they were
[1:20:05] revealed by his gospel
[1:20:09] so turn to me with romans 16 25
[1:20:12] now to him that is a power to establish
[1:20:15] you according to
[1:20:17] my gospel
[1:20:18] and the preaching of jesus christ
[1:20:20] according to the revelation of the
[1:20:22] mystery which was kept secret since the
[1:20:24] world began but is now made manifest by
[1:20:27] the scriptures of the prophets
[1:20:30] amen praise the lord
[1:20:34] so you see here again this is what he
[1:20:36] said it's according to my gospel my
[1:20:38] gospel has imparted to you mysteries
[1:20:43] because you see previous to this they
[1:20:45] didn't even know the gentiles would be
[1:20:47] saved
[1:20:49] they had no idea you know in judaism
[1:20:52] that there would ever be a bride out of
[1:20:54] the gentiles
[1:20:57] amen they they didn't understand you see
[1:21:00] it was a mystery that was hidden
[1:21:03] amen that god would have a bride
[1:21:06] out of the gentiles for his name's sake
[1:21:11] [Applause]
[1:21:13] again in romans 15 19 through many signs
[1:21:17] and wonders by the power of the spirit
[1:21:19] of god and so that from jerusalem and
[1:21:21] round about uh lyrical i have fully
[1:21:24] preached the gospel of christ so he said
[1:21:27] i have fully preached it
[1:21:31] whether it was serpent seed or
[1:21:33] predestination or eternal security or or
[1:21:36] whether
[1:21:37] baptism in jesus name or whatever it was
[1:21:40] one god come on somebody amen paul said
[1:21:43] i have fully preached it
[1:21:46] now and he said i did you know it was
[1:21:49] preached through mighty signs and
[1:21:51] wonders and the power of the spirit of
[1:21:53] god which is the way the gospel must be
[1:21:56] preached today
[1:21:58] because if we preach what paul preached
[1:22:00] is going to have mighty signs and
[1:22:02] wonders by the power of the spirit
[1:22:05] now jesus told us
[1:22:07] he told us something very very important
[1:22:11] in matthew 24 14
[1:22:14] and he says that the gospel would be
[1:22:16] preaching all the world so that the end
[1:22:18] could come
[1:22:20] no so
[1:22:21] again
[1:22:22] this this is this is very clear the
[1:22:24] gospel of the kingdom shall be preached
[1:22:26] in all the world for a witness
[1:22:28] unto all nations then shall the end come
[1:22:31] so you know that's that's why it's
[1:22:33] important that the bride has a voice
[1:22:37] amen because the voice of god i'm just
[1:22:39] quoting your prophet is in the bride
[1:22:42] amen
[1:22:44] now
[1:22:44] so he so he said so again
[1:22:47] jesus said this gospel in order for the
[1:22:50] end to come it's got to be preaching all
[1:22:52] the world
[1:22:54] now brother branham was here telling us
[1:22:56] you know when he requests this he said
[1:22:58] it ain't went there yet
[1:23:02] amen
[1:23:03] and i want to say to you it could not go
[1:23:07] until it was restored
[1:23:12] so you see the baptist cannot take it to
[1:23:14] the world that methodists cannot take
[1:23:17] into the world
[1:23:18] the bible societies can't take into the
[1:23:20] world somebody help me preach now
[1:23:23] about there is only one voice of the
[1:23:26] spirit and that is the word of god that
[1:23:29] must go into all the nations so the end
[1:23:33] can come
[1:23:37] we have the gospel according to the
[1:23:39] baptist
[1:23:40] and the math of this and the pentecostal
[1:23:43] but the gospel of the kingdom
[1:23:45] whose mysteries paul revealed must be
[1:23:48] preached unto all the world for a
[1:23:50] witness then shall the end come
[1:23:53] and we must use every means to do it
[1:23:59] amen going preaching
[1:24:02] evangelizing missionary and
[1:24:06] internet every way we can any way we can
[1:24:09] it's got to go
[1:24:11] this is our the travel must be is
[1:24:13] greatly increased
[1:24:15] where our voice is right now in the
[1:24:17] instant second is across the world
[1:24:20] our picture our voice our message
[1:24:24] are you with me
[1:24:25] what is it is because the gospel must be
[1:24:28] preached into all and don't get me wrong
[1:24:31] we are not the only one
[1:24:35] we're not the only ministry
[1:24:38] it's a pride ministry
[1:24:41] this is not about us i'm just trying to
[1:24:43] show you our little part that's all
[1:24:48] amen
[1:24:49] now can you imagine can you imagine
[1:24:52] forbidding paul to use a ship as a
[1:24:54] vehicle to preach the gospel
[1:24:56] oh although there was evil cargo on the
[1:24:58] ship all those evil slave trading was
[1:25:01] going on the ships and paul used the
[1:25:03] ships
[1:25:04] said brother tim there's there's some
[1:25:07] really bad stuff on the internet yeah
[1:25:08] there is
[1:25:12] yeah that's a good point don't look at
[1:25:14] it
[1:25:16] amen
[1:25:17] be selective
[1:25:20] amen you don't have to listen to all
[1:25:23] that other stuff
[1:25:24] but the gospel's got to go
[1:25:27] are you with me
[1:25:28] now elijah in our reading here did not
[1:25:31] add stones
[1:25:34] he laid the original stones
[1:25:37] back into place
[1:25:42] he repaired the altar of the lord he he
[1:25:45] didn't go out there and and uncover
[1:25:48] uh some platelets that are found down
[1:25:50] there like like john smith did to start
[1:25:53] the mormons
[1:25:56] he didn't do that
[1:25:58] he didn't go to seminary
[1:26:00] where they uncovered what really paul
[1:26:02] preached
[1:26:05] what how did it happen by the same angel
[1:26:08] by the same spirit of christ that
[1:26:10] revealed it to paul revealed it to
[1:26:12] brother branham
[1:26:14] so that we could have assured he had the
[1:26:17] message that paul preached
[1:26:21] now here are some snippets of what
[1:26:23] elijah's to do it's going to go back to
[1:26:25] its original again back to the real holy
[1:26:28] ghost back to the gospel message back to
[1:26:31] acts 2 again back to the formula back to
[1:26:34] where it began at
[1:26:36] again it will have the same doctrine
[1:26:38] it'll have the same power to show the
[1:26:40] same sign because it's the same kind of
[1:26:43] church that they had at the beginning
[1:26:45] again elijah will go back to the
[1:26:47] original pentecostal ephesus church and
[1:26:50] bring the same message to the people
[1:26:52] with the signs of the messiah
[1:26:55] again he will stand and that elijah will
[1:26:57] shake the people right straight back to
[1:26:59] the original pentecostal doctrine
[1:27:02] again it'll be a restoration to send
[1:27:05] that lukewarm laodicean church back to
[1:27:08] that original faith back the under yes
[1:27:10] sir he will be anointed to do so
[1:27:14] second seal he would restore and bring
[1:27:16] back the children to the faith of their
[1:27:18] fathers the original apostolic
[1:27:20] pentecostal faith which he promised to
[1:27:22] be restored
[1:27:24] third seal the bible said that this
[1:27:26] messenger the last day would restore
[1:27:29] them back to the original faith again
[1:27:31] back to the faith of the fathers but you
[1:27:33] think they would receive it no sir last
[1:27:35] days he would restore the original word
[1:27:37] again as he said in malachi 4.
[1:27:42] again he said we are a promise to
[1:27:44] malachi 4 by the same system in that
[1:27:46] same system as a prophet
[1:27:49] he always did that he would be restored
[1:27:52] that we would be restored back to the
[1:27:54] original somebody say original i hope
[1:27:57] you're catching something here
[1:27:58] everything's original
[1:28:00] it's back
[1:28:02] it's not into it's not somewhere we
[1:28:04] ain't never been
[1:28:07] it ain't something that ain't never been
[1:28:09] preached
[1:28:10] it's
[1:28:12] back to the original vine
[1:28:16] to the original root
[1:28:18] because we got to get back to the
[1:28:19] original word for a for a branch to come
[1:28:24] out of it to bear the original fruit
[1:28:27] again
[1:28:30] so he said oh my back to the original
[1:28:32] sea back to the seed like it was began
[1:28:34] on the day of pentecost back to the same
[1:28:36] doctrine word by word power by power
[1:28:39] spirit by the same thing just exactly
[1:28:41] like it was back in the beginning
[1:28:43] through signs and wonders of the living
[1:28:45] presence of jesus christ
[1:28:47] again malachi 4 said we be brought back
[1:28:50] to the original faith like it was on the
[1:28:52] day of pentecost the faith of the
[1:28:54] fathers malaga 4 said he would do this
[1:28:57] and manifest his word to turn back the
[1:28:59] faith the hearts of the children back to
[1:29:01] the fathers again back to the original
[1:29:03] pentecostal word the real bible word
[1:29:07] again we're expecting the great
[1:29:09] anointing upon the church and it turned
[1:29:11] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:29:13] original doctrine of the fathers back to
[1:29:15] real genuine pentecost what she is to be
[1:29:18] the same bride the same kind built up
[1:29:21] the same kind of material that she was
[1:29:23] in the first place now read malachi 4
[1:29:25] and see if we're not supposed to have a
[1:29:27] message in the last days that will turn
[1:29:30] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:29:32] fathers back to the original pentecostal
[1:29:34] message word by word
[1:29:38] come on somebody word by word original
[1:29:42] original original original original
[1:29:45] never something new that's not something
[1:29:48] different not something they didn't have
[1:29:50] but what original original original
[1:29:54] word by word original doctrine original
[1:29:57] power original spirit everything's
[1:30:00] original it must have back to the root
[1:30:04] because out of the root must come a
[1:30:07] branch
[1:30:11] it ain't going to do no good
[1:30:14] to get another branch a new brainchild
[1:30:16] the baptist
[1:30:18] the methodists and these grafted
[1:30:20] branches
[1:30:21] the only way you're going to have a
[1:30:23] bride that matches him is have a branch
[1:30:27] out of the original root
[1:30:31] look brother go back to pentecost let's
[1:30:33] get back to the original back to the
[1:30:35] beginning get back to where we left it
[1:30:37] amen hear me i speak it in the name of
[1:30:40] the lord back to the beginning
[1:30:44] i will bring her back to the original
[1:30:46] doctrine i'll bring her back to the
[1:30:48] original word so now how could he speak
[1:30:51] as a prophet in the name of the lord and
[1:30:54] somehow come down to the end of his
[1:30:55] ministry and speak of different results
[1:31:02] now i i just want to i want to just say
[1:31:05] as i as i went
[1:31:07] as i always say i i i study something
[1:31:11] out and i look at every aspect of it
[1:31:14] i have 84 pages
[1:31:18] that i can't afford to read to you
[1:31:21] 84 pages
[1:31:23] of this these kind of things that i just
[1:31:25] pulled a few snippets from
[1:31:28] now you see
[1:31:30] from and i just want to go from the
[1:31:32] earliest sermon
[1:31:34] from the earliest recorded one of the
[1:31:37] earliest recorded sermons of brother
[1:31:39] branham in 1948 march the 4th
[1:31:42] the angel of god he says i know the next
[1:31:46] thing to happen is the restoration of
[1:31:48] the gifts to the church
[1:31:51] and it's the hardest thing i've had to
[1:31:53] do in this pioneering work is to do to
[1:31:55] see the people god cannot give the gifts
[1:31:58] back to the church as long as this
[1:31:59] church is divided we've got to get the
[1:32:01] church together first for the gifts can
[1:32:04] come
[1:32:05] but if all the full gospel people would
[1:32:07] come together in one heart and one
[1:32:09] accord
[1:32:13] now we're we're kind of a scattered
[1:32:15] group nothing group this morning
[1:32:17] but
[1:32:18] i i just want to look just for a minute
[1:32:20] and i want to just see where you come
[1:32:22] from
[1:32:23] how many baptist former baptister here
[1:32:27] oh
[1:32:28] got a good representation i better be
[1:32:30] careful when i talk about baptists
[1:32:34] how many methodists former methodists
[1:32:36] are here now go go ahead raise your hand
[1:32:39] up brother l
[1:32:41] did you go with him too sister l
[1:32:44] [Laughter]
[1:32:47] i mean how many how many catholics are
[1:32:49] here
[1:32:51] one two there's at least two three
[1:32:53] there's nothing over there yeah
[1:32:56] so you know we we got a pentecostal how
[1:32:58] many pentecostals
[1:33:00] oh yeah we got pentecostals here
[1:33:02] so you see we got all of them now what
[1:33:05] has happened
[1:33:08] all of these have come together
[1:33:13] hallelujah in one mind one accord to one
[1:33:16] message
[1:33:18] now you might still be buying a
[1:33:19] chevrolet and me a forward you know
[1:33:21] that's not what we're talking about one
[1:33:23] mind and one accord it's not a honda
[1:33:26] are you with me but what we're talking
[1:33:28] about we have one piece and we have one
[1:33:30] goal we have one thing in mind that's to
[1:33:32] be the bride of christ to see him
[1:33:34] manifest every bit of his power and it's
[1:33:37] that kind of group
[1:33:39] [Applause]
[1:33:43] that he can reveal himself
[1:33:46] so
[1:33:47] so he sells
[1:33:49] but if all the full gospel people come
[1:33:51] together with one heart one one accord
[1:33:53] there would be a revival that would
[1:33:54] shake the whole world
[1:33:56] and every spiritual gift would be in the
[1:33:58] church within an hour's time after it
[1:33:59] took place signs and wonders that was
[1:34:02] done by the apostles would be a minor
[1:34:04] thing to what would happen if we just
[1:34:05] get the church together it's got to
[1:34:07] happen it will happen it may be after
[1:34:09] i've passed off the scene
[1:34:11] but i want to put my word in this that
[1:34:13] you would know that this that my voice
[1:34:15] is this old christian people bind
[1:34:17] yourself together with one heart one
[1:34:19] accord for god can no more send the
[1:34:21] gifts to the church while the church is
[1:34:23] separated then he can send the whole
[1:34:26] holy ghost unless we're in one accord
[1:34:28] and that's right for he comes by the
[1:34:30] holy ghost
[1:34:31] believe it again 1953 very early sermon
[1:34:35] that is recorded it's my humble belief
[1:34:38] we're living near the end time
[1:34:40] or may i make it a little more personal
[1:34:42] saying we're living in the end time
[1:34:44] i believe it's time for the restoration
[1:34:47] of the church that god promised would
[1:34:49] send in the last day and i believe that
[1:34:52] this day when the word is world where
[1:34:54] the word has been preached so much and
[1:34:56] the day is getting so dark and evil till
[1:34:58] according to god's word he was to
[1:35:00] restore all the caterpillar had eaten
[1:35:03] the palmer worm had eaten will be
[1:35:04] restored back again and this is the day
[1:35:06] of restoration of the spiritual gifts
[1:35:09] given unto the church a pentecostal
[1:35:11] branch filled with the holy ghost signs
[1:35:13] and wonders of the resurrection great
[1:35:15] things taking place they that know their
[1:35:18] god in the last days shall do exploits
[1:35:21] well brother tim but that was before the
[1:35:23] seals okay we'll take these uh you know
[1:35:26] in perfect faith uh a few months after
[1:35:29] the seals he said we are trying to get
[1:35:32] the church into the place where we could
[1:35:34] really see
[1:35:36] apostolic times moving among us
[1:35:39] now i hear preachers saying oh we don't
[1:35:41] want that kind of atmosphere well i'm
[1:35:43] sorry we do
[1:35:45] [Applause]
[1:35:47] amen we do
[1:35:49] amen that's what we all hunger so well
[1:35:52] we're not hungry for that brother tim
[1:35:54] we're hungry for the character of christ
[1:35:56] well what do you think the character
[1:35:58] christ is
[1:36:03] amen it's just laying at the door we see
[1:36:06] it
[1:36:07] and haven't we
[1:36:10] healings miracles signs wonders come on
[1:36:14] workings of the holy spirit prophetic
[1:36:16] gifts come on things that god is doing
[1:36:19] what and and we and we see it but we
[1:36:22] want to see more of it
[1:36:25] we want it to just such a flow that
[1:36:27] would be a help to us and to us flow out
[1:36:31] to others
[1:36:33] hallelujah that's why i'm glad to hear
[1:36:36] somebody down in south africa rejoicing
[1:36:38] and say it's flowed over to me it flowed
[1:36:40] over to our church
[1:36:43] hey man and you weren't making a
[1:36:44] following or a personality call that
[1:36:46] wasn't what it was about we got in love
[1:36:48] with jesus
[1:36:49] it turned our lives around it filled us
[1:36:52] with the holy ghost he put a revival on
[1:36:54] the inside of us
[1:36:55] [Applause]
[1:37:00] let's look at brother branham's
[1:37:01] expectations
[1:37:03] and and he he would uh right down to the
[1:37:06] last year of his ministry i'm going to
[1:37:08] just pick up about three of them out of
[1:37:10] his last year now
[1:37:12] i'm doing this
[1:37:13] um many it wasn't that many years ago
[1:37:16] five ten years ago maybe i read a book
[1:37:19] called killing lincoln
[1:37:22] and and it was about yeah it was this
[1:37:25] kind of historical book about the last
[1:37:28] days of lincoln
[1:37:30] on this day you know it took about the
[1:37:32] last two weeks of his life or something
[1:37:34] like that and you know lincoln did this
[1:37:37] and this and this
[1:37:39] and then
[1:37:40] you know to hear this war was going on
[1:37:43] and this and this and this happened
[1:37:45] and then you know all the way down every
[1:37:47] every day it was taken
[1:37:49] um you know the last days of lincoln and
[1:37:52] trying to retrace the steps
[1:37:55] of um of that
[1:37:57] um
[1:37:58] patriot
[1:37:59] patriot that was here in america and so
[1:38:03] you know just before he died the man who
[1:38:05] had 10 days to live now i'm just going
[1:38:07] to say it this way
[1:38:09] it really touched my heart because i
[1:38:10] began to think about the seventh angel
[1:38:14] and you know here he comes down the last
[1:38:16] life at last years of his life and i
[1:38:18] said well what were the last things
[1:38:22] that god wanted to impart to his seventh
[1:38:25] angel
[1:38:27] amen
[1:38:28] what were the last things that he would
[1:38:30] tell us before god took his elijah
[1:38:33] messenger home the seventh angel to the
[1:38:36] last church ages you know
[1:38:38] the angel of the church of laodicea
[1:38:40] right he didn't write it to you and me
[1:38:42] wrote it to the angel the messenger who
[1:38:45] brought it to you
[1:38:48] amen
[1:38:49] now so he again so i i'm looking now
[1:38:52] taking just a few of the when when this
[1:38:55] messenger would have his last few
[1:38:58] sermons
[1:39:00] to preach the last year of his life
[1:39:03] does god change his mind
[1:39:06] he says now may i say this
[1:39:09] as he talked about the church that left
[1:39:11] him at pentecost
[1:39:13] like mary and joseph left jesus and
[1:39:15] sought him three days and he said may i
[1:39:16] say this they thought he was alone
[1:39:21] but they found out in the crisis he
[1:39:23] wasn't
[1:39:25] see he wasn't with him now we find out
[1:39:27] that in the time that when this great
[1:39:29] thing has been brought up we find out
[1:39:31] that we're missing something in our
[1:39:33] churches
[1:39:34] and that's the power of christ
[1:39:38] this ain't just being said now about
[1:39:40] baptist methodist presbyterian
[1:39:42] this actually is an indictment against
[1:39:45] many message churches
[1:39:47] and he said i don't want to criticize
[1:39:50] and neither do i want to criticize
[1:39:52] that's why i'm saying get him on a car
[1:39:55] get in get instead
[1:39:58] i'm not counting anybody out i'm not
[1:40:00] saying this asking nobody else i'm not
[1:40:03] saying what if you're not preaching what
[1:40:05] i'm preaching you're not gonna make i
[1:40:06] said get in step
[1:40:09] get in line
[1:40:11] get there walk in step to the tune of
[1:40:13] the gospel
[1:40:14] we're missing christ among our
[1:40:16] pentecostal people our brothers our
[1:40:18] sister there's something wrong the
[1:40:20] old-fashioned prayer meetings they used
[1:40:22] to have all day and night they don't
[1:40:24] have them no more women used to wear
[1:40:26] long hair they don't do it anymore it
[1:40:29] would be a disgrace for a woman to use
[1:40:30] paint back in the early days and not the
[1:40:32] way women do something went wrong
[1:40:34] nothing's wrong with christ
[1:40:37] see but something went wrong something
[1:40:39] is somewhere the prophet used to
[1:40:42] wouldn't have permitted such a thing as
[1:40:44] that but it does now
[1:40:46] see the crisis is on and we're missing
[1:40:48] something
[1:40:49] we're missing power that we ought to
[1:40:52] have where the big machine ought to be
[1:40:54] running up and the great signs and
[1:40:56] wonders well this building ought to be
[1:40:58] so full of the power of god now till the
[1:41:01] sinner couldn't stand here the holy
[1:41:03] spirit condemn it right quickly like
[1:41:05] that like ananias and sapphira we're
[1:41:08] missing something
[1:41:11] again
[1:41:12] the last year
[1:41:13] i i in the last year as he concludes his
[1:41:16] message to the church and here's one of
[1:41:18] his last sermons
[1:41:20] to his home church in jeffersonville
[1:41:23] and he said when she is eve had the very
[1:41:26] filling of the word in her hands
[1:41:29] she could have took god's word but what
[1:41:30] did she do
[1:41:32] instead of tarrying for the baptism of
[1:41:34] the holy ghost let science prove to her
[1:41:37] that the holy ghost was only for the
[1:41:39] disciples
[1:41:40] instead of keeping divine healing going
[1:41:44] i want you to understand this is our
[1:41:47] responsibility
[1:41:49] to keep divine healing going to keep a
[1:41:52] faith in the church
[1:41:55] because if you can't believe for divine
[1:41:58] healing if we can't get the church to
[1:41:59] even believe that how are you going to
[1:42:01] have faith for a rapture
[1:42:03] instead of keeping divine healing going
[1:42:05] where she ought to be now
[1:42:07] raising the dead and doing great
[1:42:10] miracles she has left satan under his
[1:42:12] leadership a religious man take the word
[1:42:14] of god and try to say it was for another
[1:42:16] age and she's believed it
[1:42:19] when the bible said the things that i do
[1:42:20] shall you do also and message preachers
[1:42:23] rose up and said that was only for
[1:42:24] brother branham
[1:42:26] jesus said go into all the world and
[1:42:28] preach the gospel to every creature and
[1:42:30] we're still creatures these signs should
[1:42:32] follow them that believe and she denies
[1:42:34] every bit of it
[1:42:36] she denies all the supernatural she
[1:42:39] swapped it for an intellectual
[1:42:40] conception of the bible these are the
[1:42:42] last things the holy spirit's imparting
[1:42:46] amen we're priests and holy fathers who
[1:42:48] call we're bishops and archbishops where
[1:42:50] where uh district president or general
[1:42:53] overseer and so forth has put their own
[1:42:55] interpretation to it and god has let
[1:42:58] them sit there as
[1:42:59] set their dead as 12 o'clock
[1:43:06] now then
[1:43:07] just before he leaps
[1:43:09] he preaches about five sermons there
[1:43:11] that he doesn't preach in jeffersonville
[1:43:15] he preaches one of them is the rapture
[1:43:18] another before the rapture is things
[1:43:20] that are to be
[1:43:22] another in his modern events made clear
[1:43:24] by prophecy
[1:43:26] leadership
[1:43:27] and he ends the ministry the ministry of
[1:43:30] christ through that prophetic ministry
[1:43:32] would end just like jesus did with
[1:43:34] communion
[1:43:39] leadership one saved one lost
[1:43:42] just like the thieves on the cross
[1:43:45] modern events made clear by prophecy
[1:43:50] things that are to be john john chapter
[1:43:53] 14 or john chapter 15
[1:43:56] whichever one it is he said where where
[1:43:58] he says um
[1:44:01] you know he said he makes it clear that
[1:44:03] that he's coming again
[1:44:05] we're not talking about brother branham
[1:44:06] coming again jesus was talking about if
[1:44:09] i go away
[1:44:10] you know i i must go away
[1:44:13] and he began to begin to speak on those
[1:44:16] things you know in my father's house
[1:44:19] are many mansions
[1:44:21] in fact before he would leave in 1965 he
[1:44:25] would tell us what those mansions were
[1:44:28] there were more than of something with
[1:44:30] gold doorknobs and and and crystal
[1:44:33] windows and painted things uh you know
[1:44:36] man-made stuff come on
[1:44:38] more than just gold gold is just dust
[1:44:42] dirt on the street pavement
[1:44:44] on the streets of glory the most
[1:44:46] precious thing we hear have here is only
[1:44:49] pavement there
[1:44:52] amen so you see jesus would tell us
[1:44:55] things that are to be
[1:44:57] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:45:00] i go away to prepare a place
[1:45:03] and brother branham would come right
[1:45:05] down to things that are be in other
[1:45:07] words things we can't expect
[1:45:11] things that are to be things we can't
[1:45:13] expect
[1:45:14] and i believe that's the same thing we
[1:45:16] live today
[1:45:17] god bearing record of his word by
[1:45:18] vindicating what he said he would do now
[1:45:21] we know that this is the day of
[1:45:22] salvation where god is calling men from
[1:45:25] the world to from a life of sin and to a
[1:45:28] life of service that kicks out god's off
[1:45:30] his mercy doesn't it and then the day
[1:45:32] that god has poured out his spirit up
[1:45:34] from on high great signs and wonders are
[1:45:36] to accompany the ministry of this day
[1:45:39] this is when the former and latter rain
[1:45:41] are falling together and we know that
[1:45:43] there is supposed to be great signs and
[1:45:45] wonders which in many denominations this
[1:45:48] is turned down
[1:45:51] things that are to be
[1:45:54] now let's go to the last recorded sermon
[1:45:57] here he comes communion foot washing
[1:46:00] the ministry listen that was the
[1:46:02] ministry of christ we saw repeated
[1:46:06] we did
[1:46:07] amen it wasn't jesus
[1:46:09] but it was his ministry now with the
[1:46:12] same sign proven it's the word that
[1:46:14] discerns the thoughts in the entire
[1:46:16] heart the messiah sign and and christ
[1:46:19] the word being present and here he comes
[1:46:21] right down to the last sermon communion
[1:46:28] and it's not to the church
[1:46:32] it's not to the world
[1:46:34] it's too little group of followers
[1:46:36] believers
[1:46:38] of his message
[1:46:46] in an old jewish synagogue
[1:46:50] that's where
[1:46:53] that's where tucson tabernacle was
[1:46:56] and brother branham would speak
[1:46:59] to those who believed his message
[1:47:01] communion
[1:47:02] last sermon
[1:47:04] you know the hour will soon arise when
[1:47:06] right among us will be
[1:47:08] the holy spirit will speak out like it
[1:47:10] did in ananias sapphira
[1:47:13] remember that hour is arriving see now
[1:47:16] you just remember that that god
[1:47:18] and this just drills my heart
[1:47:20] god is going to dwell among his people
[1:47:23] that's what he wants to do now
[1:47:31] so all the way through from the
[1:47:33] beginning to the end it was proclaimed
[1:47:36] that the same bride
[1:47:38] as it was in the original will be once
[1:47:41] again in the end
[1:47:44] we often say jesus christ the same
[1:47:46] yesterday today and forever is the theme
[1:47:48] of the message but really it's because
[1:47:50] god said i will restore
[1:47:52] so restoration was his theme because
[1:47:55] without restoration jesus christ
[1:47:58] couldn't be the same
[1:48:00] now so again let's go back to verse 33
[1:48:03] of chapter 18 of verse kings and let's
[1:48:05] just look at this so he put
[1:48:08] the wood in order is everybody with me
[1:48:11] first kings 18 33 he put the wood in
[1:48:15] order the wood of the word placed
[1:48:18] correctly
[1:48:20] and cut the bullock in pieces to
[1:48:23] sacrifice the atonement and his work as
[1:48:26] intercessor properly placed
[1:48:30] amen listen it wasn't an altar without a
[1:48:33] sacrifice
[1:48:34] it was not an altar without an accessory
[1:48:38] come on somebody that's a lie of the
[1:48:40] devil
[1:48:41] that tries to take the intercessor from
[1:48:44] the bride of christ he is our
[1:48:46] intercessor well brother jim how could
[1:48:48] it be him friend or sister he's a bright
[1:48:50] grammy you know and and he's not he you
[1:48:52] know he's not he's not the the the
[1:48:54] mediator he's the bridegroom and the
[1:48:57] mediator and the bridegroom were all the
[1:48:59] same one
[1:49:00] it was just god changing his mask
[1:49:08] he mediated to open the
[1:49:12] seals was mandatorial work
[1:49:16] to take the book clear the deed
[1:49:18] meditorial work
[1:49:20] the rapture is mandatorial work
[1:49:25] amen we're gone intercedes on our behalf
[1:49:30] and raptures a church chains in her body
[1:49:34] amen that's his work as high priest
[1:49:37] prepare to pride for his image
[1:49:42] watch now
[1:49:43] the with the word properly placed
[1:49:46] cut the bullock in pieces to sacrifice
[1:49:48] atonement his work his intercessor
[1:49:50] properly placed
[1:49:52] laid him on the wood and said for a few
[1:49:55] four barrels with water and pour it on
[1:49:57] the sacrifice on on the wood and do it a
[1:50:00] second time and they did it the second
[1:50:02] time do it the third time and they did
[1:50:03] it the third time
[1:50:05] three times four equals twelve spirit
[1:50:09] forever tribe
[1:50:14] amen if it was our day it would be seven
[1:50:18] the seven spirits of god for seven ages
[1:50:21] but this was israel in their time and
[1:50:23] they had they were represented by 12
[1:50:24] we're represented by seven
[1:50:27] now what so he said and the water ran
[1:50:29] around the altar and he filled the trees
[1:50:31] thereof with water and it came to pass
[1:50:33] that the offering of the evening
[1:50:35] sacrifice look when it all happens at
[1:50:38] the evening sacrifice in the evening
[1:50:41] time it shall be light
[1:50:44] in the last day
[1:50:47] amen in the at the time of the offering
[1:50:50] of the evening sacrifice that elijah the
[1:50:52] prophet came near and said lord god of
[1:50:55] abraham isaac and israel let it be known
[1:50:59] this day that thou art god in heaven and
[1:51:02] i am thy servant and i have done all
[1:51:04] these things by thy word
[1:51:07] amen so what was elijah ministry to do
[1:51:10] to introduce us back to jehovah away
[1:51:13] from trinity come on back to one god
[1:51:15] again
[1:51:17] not two lords one lord one faith one
[1:51:19] baptism
[1:51:21] amen what did he say now he says i have
[1:51:24] done all of this by vision
[1:51:27] amen
[1:51:28] i have done all these things as thy word
[1:51:31] by
[1:51:32] vision i placed i found the stones
[1:51:38] hallelujah i found the mystery truths
[1:51:41] what paul said about the original sin
[1:51:44] what paul taught about baptism in jesus
[1:51:46] name what paul paul taught about the the
[1:51:49] godhead what paul talked about eternal
[1:51:52] security i found every one of these
[1:51:54] truths by vision
[1:51:58] i got the dirt
[1:52:01] off of these neglected truths
[1:52:04] and i've repaired the altar
[1:52:09] the angel now i'm going to say something
[1:52:11] here
[1:52:12] the angel that discerned the hearts
[1:52:15] that restored health to the sick
[1:52:18] restored healing
[1:52:20] hearing to the death
[1:52:22] restored sight to the blind
[1:52:25] the same angel
[1:52:31] the same angel
[1:52:35] help brother branham find showed him
[1:52:37] where to find and place
[1:52:39] the neglected stones
[1:52:42] of baptism of oneness of original sin
[1:52:46] predestination security of the believer
[1:52:49] and put all of these mystery truths in
[1:52:51] order
[1:52:53] so we could come back to true worship
[1:52:56] so that there could be a people in the
[1:52:58] last days that worship god in spirit
[1:53:01] and in truth
[1:53:04] verse 37 hear me o lord hear me that the
[1:53:08] people may know that thou art the lord
[1:53:11] god and that thou has what
[1:53:14] turned their hearts where
[1:53:16] back
[1:53:17] again
[1:53:19] and then the fire god fell and consumed
[1:53:22] the birds sacrificed the wood the stones
[1:53:24] the dust and licked up the water that
[1:53:26] was in the trees the pillar of fire was
[1:53:28] his vindication
[1:53:32] you see roberts claimed the gift of
[1:53:34] healing
[1:53:35] that was in his right hand jack cole had
[1:53:37] blind and reckless faith hey allen
[1:53:39] exhibited a gift of faith but only
[1:53:41] brother branham was accompanied by an
[1:53:43] angel and vindicated by a pillar of fire
[1:53:47] because while he was the elijah
[1:53:52] and when all the people saw it
[1:53:54] they fell on their faces and said the
[1:53:57] lord he is god
[1:54:00] the lord he is the god
[1:54:05] and when we saw it we said this is the
[1:54:08] lord and he is the world
[1:54:12] and this is why malachi 4 says that when
[1:54:14] the spirit upon elijah that was upon
[1:54:16] elijah comes in the last day that it
[1:54:18] will turn the hearts of the children
[1:54:20] back to the faith of the fathers
[1:54:26] so let us understand his job and purpose
[1:54:29] i know
[1:54:30] sometimes you think these things are
[1:54:32] elementary but it seems like we
[1:54:35] somebody moves the landmarks
[1:54:37] and i'm coming back and pointing out
[1:54:39] these are the landmarks
[1:54:42] amen so malachi 4 was to turn the hearts
[1:54:45] of the children back to the faith of the
[1:54:47] pentecostal father so let's let's
[1:54:49] understand this i want to get something
[1:54:51] clear
[1:54:52] i want to make sure nobody
[1:54:53] misunderstands me i am not talking about
[1:54:56] restoring the azusa street revival nor
[1:54:59] what they had there
[1:55:00] they were not and let me say it again
[1:55:03] they were not a book of acts church
[1:55:07] here's a point i want to make clear if
[1:55:09] azusa was a restoration of pentecost
[1:55:14] and the book of acts then there would
[1:55:16] have been no need for an elijah ministry
[1:55:18] to restore it
[1:55:23] amen
[1:55:25] it had already been done
[1:55:27] pentecost brought that back
[1:55:30] no brother branham the prophet the
[1:55:33] messenger the elijah
[1:55:35] restored it back
[1:55:39] susan street was just another
[1:55:42] grafted-in vine
[1:55:44] branch so the original vine was christ
[1:55:48] and the first branch was pentecost now
[1:55:52] let me just say this i'm going to quote
[1:55:53] brother branham because and and and let
[1:55:56] me just say it
[1:55:58] and then i'll quote it if you don't see
[1:56:01] pentecostal in the branch
[1:56:04] it is a grafted vine
[1:56:10] from the brother branham said that this
[1:56:12] jesus said i'm the vine you are the
[1:56:14] branches john 15. i believe is that
[1:56:16] right i'm the vine now what did the vine
[1:56:19] put forth a branch
[1:56:21] the first branch was the pentecostal
[1:56:23] church is that right
[1:56:25] then the second branch comes forth will
[1:56:27] be another pentecostal church
[1:56:29] now we don't see pentecostal in all the
[1:56:31] churches do we
[1:56:34] no well what is it it's a grafted vine
[1:56:38] see you can take an orange tree and
[1:56:40] graft almost any kind of citrus fruit
[1:56:42] you can graft almost anything grapefruit
[1:56:44] or whatever it is what what more but
[1:56:46] it's the grafted but if the original
[1:56:48] vine itself puts out a branch it'll
[1:56:51] bring the same kind of fruit that was
[1:56:53] the first one
[1:56:54] brought so
[1:56:56] what's going to happen now
[1:56:59] here we're in the end time
[1:57:01] i told you last sunday god's looking for
[1:57:03] fruit
[1:57:04] not just any fruit
[1:57:06] he wants his fruit
[1:57:08] his fruit he's looking for his fruit
[1:57:12] fruit that came from the original vine
[1:57:16] so what's going to happen to the
[1:57:17] branches
[1:57:19] then that are not bringing
[1:57:21] that are not bringing um
[1:57:24] the fruit of the original pentecost
[1:57:27] now jesus answers that question
[1:57:29] he does he tells you what's going to
[1:57:31] happen
[1:57:32] to branches that are not bringing the
[1:57:34] fruit of original pentecost
[1:57:36] he says every branch in me
[1:57:39] that beareth not fruit he taketh away
[1:57:42] you're cut off from me
[1:57:44] if you don't bear fruit you're going to
[1:57:45] be cut off
[1:57:47] and if a man abide not in me
[1:57:50] he is cast forth as a branch and is
[1:57:52] withered and men gather them and cast
[1:57:54] them into the fire and they are burned
[1:57:58] so this is what's going to happen if you
[1:58:00] don't bear the fruit
[1:58:03] amen
[1:58:04] now in the laodicean church ages brother
[1:58:06] branham preached it in 1960 he said now
[1:58:09] so therefore you must remember jesus
[1:58:11] stands at your door and remember god's
[1:58:14] promise here that he will in the last
[1:58:16] days because of what
[1:58:19] now remember that's what's happening
[1:58:21] right now christ is being rejected
[1:58:26] somebody help me preach
[1:58:28] rejected revelation 3 he's on outside of
[1:58:31] the door
[1:58:33] the last place he's going to be rejected
[1:58:35] is going to be in message churches
[1:58:41] are you with me
[1:58:43] i don't want it to be our church
[1:58:47] listen what rejected what caused israel
[1:58:51] to be cut off the original tree because
[1:58:54] they rejected paul's pentecostal message
[1:58:58] and do you believe this is the last
[1:59:00] church age the bible said so and what
[1:59:02] are what and what says going to happen
[1:59:04] to them they're going to be cut off
[1:59:06] because of rejecting the pentecostal
[1:59:08] message and god will return
[1:59:11] again to the jews
[1:59:13] what
[1:59:14] they're going to be cut off for what
[1:59:17] rejecting the pentecostal message
[1:59:22] now so this is what we're in danger of
[1:59:25] in this last day
[1:59:28] amen when we're saying they're rejecting
[1:59:30] christ we're talking about rejecting the
[1:59:32] pentecostal message
[1:59:35] now when god created his church he
[1:59:37] created a pentecostal church
[1:59:39] that was the original a church filled
[1:59:41] with the holy ghost men and women led by
[1:59:44] the spirit of god man couldn't couldn't
[1:59:46] leave that alone he wanted to hybrid the
[1:59:48] church to be bred in the world with it
[1:59:50] theology doctrines denomination oh it
[1:59:52] sure makes a pretty your church my oh
[1:59:55] yes my how much different is that for
[1:59:58] the original church
[2:00:00] again he would preach this
[2:00:02] right at the round of the same time of
[2:00:04] the church ages he said in condemnation
[2:00:06] by representation his father he says
[2:00:08] father so is it now near the coming of
[2:00:10] the lord jesus again just like the vine
[2:00:13] if the vine puts forth the branch and
[2:00:15] that brights was a pentecostal branch
[2:00:17] filled with the holy ghost signs and
[2:00:19] wonders and fruits followed the branch
[2:00:21] if that vine ever puts
[2:00:24] another branch it'll be the same kind of
[2:00:28] branch
[2:00:30] amen so he said we can take an orange
[2:00:31] tree and this is still in his prayer
[2:00:34] gross citrus fruit of different kinds
[2:00:36] seven or eight we can put lemons and
[2:00:38] we'll grow right on because citrus fruit
[2:00:40] he'll grow grapefruit many other things
[2:00:42] tangerines and other citrus fruit but if
[2:00:45] that tree brings forth its own branch
[2:00:48] again it'll be an orange
[2:00:51] lord
[2:00:52] it'll be like the first one was
[2:00:54] and we believe that that that there used
[2:00:56] to be a church in these last days that
[2:00:59] will receive both the former and lighter
[2:01:02] reign he's still saying that
[2:01:04] right at the end of his ministry it'll
[2:01:06] be scattered throughout the world in
[2:01:08] this laodicean age it'll be a church
[2:01:10] that is called back to the original
[2:01:13] faith in god it'll be a church that'll
[2:01:15] have jesus christ walking in it
[2:01:18] manifests himself the shout of the king
[2:01:21] will be in it
[2:01:23] hallelujah
[2:01:25] now let me show you a few more snippets
[2:01:28] from different sermons after a while
[2:01:30] it's going back to its original again
[2:01:33] back to the real holy ghost back to the
[2:01:35] gospel message back to acts 2 again back
[2:01:38] to the formula back to where it began at
[2:01:42] again we've got to get back to a
[2:01:44] pentecostal experience again we're not
[2:01:46] talking about azusa street
[2:01:49] but when he comes this time he will turn
[2:01:51] the hearts of the church back to the
[2:01:53] pentecostal fathers again what we need
[2:01:56] is back to the pentecostal message back
[2:01:58] to the holy ghost that is true again
[2:02:01] come back to the homeland to the
[2:02:03] beginning back to the pentecostal
[2:02:05] experience like that happened on the day
[2:02:06] of pentecost uh when the power of the
[2:02:09] living god changed thousands of people
[2:02:11] set their hearts all with the on fire
[2:02:14] with the fire of god that so genuine not
[2:02:16] impersonated gifts again the hearts of
[2:02:19] the children back to the pentecostal
[2:02:21] fathers the original message restored
[2:02:24] the faith of the children back to the
[2:02:25] pentecostal fathers again back to the
[2:02:28] original faith i believe it's the
[2:02:30] evening lights and again he will restore
[2:02:33] the faith of the children back to the
[2:02:34] pentecostal fathers away from their
[2:02:36] creeds and dogmas it has got to come and
[2:02:39] it will come in the name of the lord it
[2:02:42] will come
[2:02:44] hallelujah
[2:02:47] it is a fact that the prophet for the
[2:02:49] last seeds must be bringing a message
[2:02:50] from god that'll forerun the second
[2:02:53] coming of the lord for by his message
[2:02:55] with the hearts of the children be
[2:02:57] turned back to the pentecostal fathers
[2:02:59] and with the restoration of the word
[2:03:01] will come the restoration of power
[2:03:05] amen so you see again this this is where
[2:03:08] we are this is this is the promise that
[2:03:11] is given yeah and and brother branham
[2:03:14] said we need as minister to preach the
[2:03:17] gospel and bring the church back to
[2:03:21] pentecost again
[2:03:22] bring it back to the eagle experience
[2:03:28] what the church needs you don't want to
[2:03:30] be chickens your eagles you've got to
[2:03:32] take eagle food
[2:03:35] and that's bringing the church back to
[2:03:37] pentecost again
[2:03:39] this is why
[2:03:40] elijah
[2:03:41] the prophet comes
[2:03:46] again
[2:03:49] laodicean church age
[2:03:51] and the hearts of the children to the
[2:03:53] fathers
[2:03:54] and when this great elijah comes in the
[2:03:56] end of this age
[2:03:57] he'll be taking the message of pentecost
[2:04:00] to turn the children to the faith of the
[2:04:02] fathers because he'll be rebuking them
[2:04:05] because they didn't keep the same faith
[2:04:07] that was back there at the beginning
[2:04:10] so turn the hearts back
[2:04:14] turn back with me to psalms 80 and verse
[2:04:17] 18.
[2:04:19] then we will not turn away from you
[2:04:22] revive us and we will call on thy name
[2:04:26] we will call on your name now not the
[2:04:28] name of baptist methodist assembly of
[2:04:31] god upc those are grafted branches
[2:04:36] not a revival
[2:04:38] or a grafted vine of perusia or coleman
[2:04:42] standards or two souls those are grafted
[2:04:45] fines
[2:04:47] or branches into the message
[2:04:49] and i just want to say that's not the
[2:04:52] name of our bridegroom tree
[2:04:54] amen
[2:04:56] he said we will call on your name
[2:04:59] you see salvation is not in those other
[2:05:02] names
[2:05:03] yet they may think they're saved by the
[2:05:05] name of baptist or methodist but those
[2:05:07] are blasphemous names
[2:05:10] because to be called by any other name
[2:05:13] then our bridegroom is a sign of a lewd
[2:05:16] and adulterous woman
[2:05:18] a
[2:05:22] so there's going to be a people now that
[2:05:24] will call that will be called by his
[2:05:27] name and that will call upon his name
[2:05:31] verse 19 restore or turn again o lord
[2:05:35] god almighty make your face shine on us
[2:05:38] that we may be saved
[2:05:40] amen oh my look it now these are
[2:05:43] powerful words you see the last day
[2:05:46] anointing the pouring out of god's
[2:05:48] spirit is shown over in revelation 10 1
[2:05:52] as the face of the son
[2:05:55] which is saying the word returning in
[2:05:58] its fullness
[2:06:01] that's what he said i saw another mighty
[2:06:03] angel
[2:06:05] come down from heaven clove with a cloud
[2:06:07] rainbow on his head his face was as it
[2:06:10] were the sun
[2:06:12] this is exactly psalms 80 19
[2:06:15] us o lord god almighty make your face
[2:06:18] shine upon us so we can be saved so
[2:06:21] there can be a rapture
[2:06:23] my goodness church we got to be saved
[2:06:25] out of this sodom world
[2:06:28] amen we can't stay here the whole
[2:06:30] world's going to burn
[2:06:33] come on church remember there's got to
[2:06:35] be a rapture in this day and to do it
[2:06:38] we've got to have the full word
[2:06:41] shining in his son
[2:06:43] amen shining as the son in his full
[2:06:46] strength
[2:06:47] and its full power
[2:06:51] not no more partial message
[2:06:55] the light of his face shines bringing us
[2:06:57] the word with his full power amen
[2:07:02] and just as every substance of life
[2:07:05] lives on earth by the energy from the
[2:07:08] sun
[2:07:09] even so the bride of christ lives by the
[2:07:11] energy from the word
[2:07:14] he was clothed with a cloud
[2:07:17] but there was no cloud over his face
[2:07:22] it was the full word
[2:07:24] shining in its strength and full power
[2:07:29] but i just want to say to you
[2:07:31] before you get to thinking
[2:07:33] this is something new
[2:07:36] it is not something new
[2:07:38] it is the same s-o-n
[2:07:41] that's shown in the morning
[2:07:44] is the same s-o-n
[2:07:46] shining in the evening time
[2:07:49] so after a cloudy and dismal day through
[2:07:52] the dark ages it's saturday night
[2:07:55] in the evening time
[2:07:58] hallelujah and the path of glory you
[2:08:00] will surely find
[2:08:03] hallelujah that it's god's word to us
[2:08:07] in the evening time it's shabby light
[2:08:11] hallelujah
[2:08:12] not a different sun
[2:08:14] not a different light not a different
[2:08:16] doctrine not a different truth the
[2:08:19] original sun with the clouds taken off
[2:08:22] of it and seeing him in his full glory
[2:08:25] hallelujah in the seven-fold glory of
[2:08:28] this person the the foot the unveiling
[2:08:32] of god the full god may manifest the
[2:08:35] full word coming again to make a pride
[2:08:38] in the end time to shine above the last
[2:08:41] branch
[2:08:43] so she'll bring forth fruits
[2:08:45] evening time fruits
[2:08:52] because in the cloudy day
[2:08:55] he couldn't bring the fruits
[2:09:00] but here in the evening time
[2:09:03] the fruits come back on the vine
[2:09:07] i will restore
[2:09:09] voice of the sign he said it shall be
[2:09:11] light and evening time there will be a
[2:09:13] sunrise in the evening time don't miss
[2:09:15] it friends don't miss it not the same
[2:09:18] sun
[2:09:18] would give the same light the same s-u-n
[2:09:22] gives the same s-u-n light the same
[2:09:24] s-o-n gives the same s-o-n light
[2:09:28] get it again full sun
[2:09:31] fullness of the word fullness of its
[2:09:33] power
[2:09:34] all full of its energy
[2:09:36] everything in it nothing missing
[2:09:39] amen
[2:09:41] there's no shadow over healing
[2:09:44] you didn't see it ain't the season for
[2:09:46] miracles that's a bunch of baloney
[2:09:49] amen it is the season it's the light the
[2:09:52] full light full word it ain't the time
[2:09:55] for a gift
[2:09:57] that's a bunch of nonsense it's the full
[2:09:59] light it's the full word it ain't the
[2:10:01] time for prayer line that's nonsense
[2:10:03] it's the full word it's the full light
[2:10:05] it ain't the time for
[2:10:07] for people to fall out in the spirit
[2:10:09] they did all down through the bible
[2:10:12] and yes they did in brother brandon's
[2:10:14] ministry
[2:10:18] but we don't want that today that's
[2:10:20] because you're rejecting christ
[2:10:24] amen now he said in verse 25
[2:10:27] of joel now
[2:10:29] and i will restore it to joel 2 25 i
[2:10:32] will restore to you
[2:10:34] the years
[2:10:36] amen everything that was lost amen
[2:10:41] all the lost crops of the past
[2:10:44] what they should have had in luther's
[2:10:46] day in wesley's day and but you see hey
[2:10:49] you know but now it's going to be a
[2:10:51] different time the the the the fats
[2:10:55] shall overflow with oil
[2:10:58] and the floor will overflow with wheat
[2:11:01] i i'm going to restore everything
[2:11:06] amen there will be there will be a bride
[2:11:08] that's a holy bride because i'm
[2:11:10] restoring holiness
[2:11:12] there will be a word bride because i'm
[2:11:14] restoring the word
[2:11:16] there will be a gifted bride because i
[2:11:18] have gifted her everything that is in
[2:11:21] the word is hers
[2:11:23] the full word the full book the open
[2:11:25] book nothing missing the light all the
[2:11:28] way from genesis to revelation
[2:11:33] i will restore
[2:11:35] so as israel was a fruitful vine
[2:11:38] so
[2:11:39] has
[2:11:40] so ah
[2:11:44] and so was
[2:11:45] so is spiritual israel
[2:11:47] the church
[2:11:48] is to be the spiritual vine
[2:11:51] now brother branham tells us
[2:11:53] in his sermon palm worm locust and
[2:11:55] caterpillar he preached numerous sermons
[2:11:58] and i will restore you know where the
[2:12:00] blind the the divine and word of planet
[2:12:03] um com palmer locus caterpillar all
[2:12:05] these all these different ones the
[2:12:07] restoration of the bride tree this was
[2:12:10] esteem
[2:12:12] god's going to use elijah to restore
[2:12:15] it ain't never been restored yet azusa
[2:12:17] didn't restore it luther didn't restore
[2:12:19] it wesley didn't restore it it's going
[2:12:21] to be restored by the same system
[2:12:23] denominational systems can't do it so
[2:12:26] god's system of sending a prophet is how
[2:12:28] i'm going to do it
[2:12:32] before we can have ever have a building
[2:12:34] of the church of god we'll have to
[2:12:35] restore back all those things that these
[2:12:37] insects have eaten out of it we'll have
[2:12:39] to go back and find out what these
[2:12:41] insects see
[2:12:42] he is the vine we're the branches
[2:12:45] and before we can ever find out or the
[2:12:47] church can stand in this formal and and
[2:12:49] original power we'll have to go back and
[2:12:51] find out what the insects ate and the
[2:12:53] church will have to be restored back to
[2:12:55] that or it will never stand in its power
[2:12:58] and glory of its first standing
[2:13:02] so if we're going to restore
[2:13:04] then what kind of vine was it originally
[2:13:08] the original church was rooted in christ
[2:13:11] and the first branch was a book of acts
[2:13:14] church
[2:13:15] so why aren't the other branches in the
[2:13:17] christian church producing another book
[2:13:19] of acts
[2:13:21] is because like looking at the orange
[2:13:23] tree and there isn't any oranges
[2:13:26] but rather grapefruit lemons and
[2:13:27] tangerines and all different kinds of
[2:13:29] flavors
[2:13:31] but not any oranges
[2:13:33] and today we got varieties of christians
[2:13:35] who are supposed to be attached to the
[2:13:37] root christ but they're nothing like the
[2:13:39] original root
[2:13:42] so brother branham said in the patmos
[2:13:44] vision that's the way the churches
[2:13:45] they'll split the vine and graft it in
[2:13:48] presbyterian methodist baptists and so
[2:13:50] forth it's baptist fruit presbyterian
[2:13:52] fruit methodist fruit but if that tree
[2:13:55] ever brings forth another vine it'll
[2:13:57] break the same kind of vine it was
[2:13:59] brought on the day of pentecost the
[2:14:00] original vine it'll speak in tongues and
[2:14:03] have the power and the signs of the
[2:14:05] resurrected christ in it because it's
[2:14:08] thriving and the natural resource that
[2:14:10] it was planted in actually is not
[2:14:12] planted it is born in it praise the lord
[2:14:14] said didn't think of that one right then
[2:14:16] these other grafted in and they grabbed
[2:14:18] them into the trees so they bear their
[2:14:20] own kind of fruit they can't take this
[2:14:23] they don't believe in that because they
[2:14:25] never knew nothing about it but if
[2:14:27] they're born in that same life that came
[2:14:30] out of that tree there's only one thing
[2:14:32] that they can bear and it's the life of
[2:14:35] the original stem
[2:14:38] hallelujah so what did what in the world
[2:14:41] what happened with when these insects
[2:14:43] come down to eat the tree i'm trying to
[2:14:45] bring this to a close
[2:14:46] i got just a few more minutes
[2:14:49] behold your thought just just a moment
[2:14:52] how come how come the the the bark the
[2:14:55] original bark is missing off the tr off
[2:14:59] of the tree
[2:15:01] insects
[2:15:04] amen
[2:15:05] you see he began the first thing he did
[2:15:07] was begin to take
[2:15:08] the covering
[2:15:11] the religion away
[2:15:13] by the way any religion without emotion
[2:15:16] is dead you need to bury it
[2:15:18] i'm quoting your prophet
[2:15:20] amen amen it's got to have the spirit
[2:15:23] running up and down through it
[2:15:25] come on
[2:15:26] amen so he began to take his it's
[2:15:29] covering his doctrine religion is a
[2:15:31] doctrine that covers anything that's the
[2:15:33] reason our religion is by the blood is
[2:15:35] the blood the blood must be void the
[2:15:37] blood is the spirit the bride is the
[2:15:40] blood by the spirit
[2:15:41] are you with me so true doctrine is not
[2:15:44] a dead letter flowing through the word
[2:15:48] of truth is the life of christ the
[2:15:51] spirit and it pushes christ from the
[2:15:54] roots through the branches producing the
[2:15:56] leaves and the fruit
[2:15:58] and that's why that doctrine that is not
[2:16:01] carrying the spirit
[2:16:03] somebody help me producing signs and
[2:16:05] wonders and miracles and healing a holy
[2:16:08] life a righteous character produces a
[2:16:11] dead snag
[2:16:13] for buzzards to root stone
[2:16:18] once the dark is stripped and that's
[2:16:22] what happened these insects these demons
[2:16:25] they're called horse riders in the book
[2:16:26] of revelation the insects in the book of
[2:16:28] joy
[2:16:29] but anyway are you with me now it comes
[2:16:31] there and it strips away the bark
[2:16:34] and you know what man does he tries to
[2:16:36] replace it with his own he puts a rag
[2:16:38] around it
[2:16:40] hey man i said you know there's some
[2:16:41] kind of substitute rag around it but you
[2:16:44] see the life of the of the vine will not
[2:16:48] flow through a rag
[2:16:52] it's got to be the bark the lifeline and
[2:16:54] what it's got to be the original
[2:16:56] doctrine
[2:16:58] amen the original word because the
[2:17:01] spirit flows through the word
[2:17:04] amen and it'll produce the same light
[2:17:06] that the tree had before the insects ate
[2:17:08] it
[2:17:10] amen but you know there again
[2:17:12] you know that's why we got so many isms
[2:17:14] among us
[2:17:16] because insects come along and ate the
[2:17:18] bark
[2:17:19] and we put the rag of peruse around it
[2:17:21] the rag of coleman's thunders the rags
[2:17:23] of two souls and the rags and the holy
[2:17:25] spirit can't work through that
[2:17:28] same thing they did with baptist
[2:17:29] methodism presbyterian they put those
[2:17:31] rags around them
[2:17:33] a man put a covering around because it
[2:17:35] moved the original doctrine
[2:17:37] but god said i will restore saith the
[2:17:40] lord i'll bring back it to the original
[2:17:43] gospel that paul preached
[2:17:46] and when it does the spirit is going to
[2:17:48] flow through it and it'll produce leaves
[2:17:51] it'll produce fruit it'll produce
[2:17:53] branches it'll produce life
[2:17:57] it'll produce a shade for the almighty
[2:18:00] to come and sit down and are meant to be
[2:18:03] entertained
[2:18:07] but when you cut the lifeline
[2:18:10] you're a woodsman
[2:18:12] you know
[2:18:13] you cut around the tree and girdle it
[2:18:15] around what is it going to do
[2:18:17] it'll kill it
[2:18:19] buddy you know one day
[2:18:22] i i had these big pine trees i had 13 of
[2:18:25] them
[2:18:26] in my yard i wound up cutting them down
[2:18:28] building a house out of them
[2:18:30] that's where i got most of the lumber
[2:18:32] from my house big pine trees
[2:18:35] underneath them you know
[2:18:36] i thought it would be nice to have some
[2:18:39] dogwoods
[2:18:41] some
[2:18:42] fruiting trees and cherry blossoms
[2:18:45] you know some magnolias around and
[2:18:47] different things coming up underneath
[2:18:49] them and just kind of make it a canopy
[2:18:51] around
[2:18:52] i'd make it a pleasant garden
[2:18:55] so i went i went to a
[2:18:57] nursery
[2:18:58] uh catalog and i picked out some
[2:19:01] different ones that would grow under
[2:19:03] those pine trees
[2:19:05] and i
[2:19:06] got them and they were little
[2:19:08] about that long
[2:19:10] and i planted them out there
[2:19:12] and i put them
[2:19:13] i put them all around under them trees
[2:19:17] and i cared for them and watered them
[2:19:19] and watched them and made sure insects
[2:19:21] wasn't eating on them went away to
[2:19:23] preach a a service one time
[2:19:27] and
[2:19:28] and i i i came back home
[2:19:32] and sister karen had surprised me bless
[2:19:34] her heart
[2:19:36] and she had weed eat it
[2:19:44] she didn't cut him down she just girdled
[2:19:46] everyone up
[2:19:48] the only one that survived and is still
[2:19:50] alive today is a magnolia tree
[2:19:53] and it was this didn't have no weeds
[2:19:55] around it so she didn't ever we'd eat it
[2:19:58] but all the others she killed
[2:20:01] and i walked out when i got home i
[2:20:03] walked that was looking around at my
[2:20:04] plants i've been waiting and i was like
[2:20:06] ah what's happened to my
[2:20:09] what
[2:20:12] i messed up a good thing she never weed
[2:20:14] eat it again
[2:20:19] but that's all you have to do is girdle
[2:20:21] the bark
[2:20:22] cut the original doctrine
[2:20:24] the life won't flow
[2:20:26] the leaves will wither
[2:20:29] are you with me amen again again that's
[2:20:32] the same thing rags i could have went
[2:20:34] there and tied rags around them
[2:20:37] somebody helped me preach
[2:20:39] but it would never produce the tree
[2:20:42] it had to be the original but i couldn't
[2:20:45] put it back on there
[2:20:47] and when man takes it away he can't put
[2:20:49] it back but god can he said i will
[2:20:52] restore saith the lord i'll bring my
[2:20:55] garden back to original condition again
[2:21:02] so what'd he do he ate off faith
[2:21:04] you know because and when faith was
[2:21:06] adopted you know the divine's not
[2:21:08] operating like it did at the beginning
[2:21:10] even jude said we must earnestly contend
[2:21:14] for the faith that was once delivered to
[2:21:15] the saints we're losing something here
[2:21:18] amen this faith i want to hear your
[2:21:21] prophet say the faith of the saints was
[2:21:23] not in creeds it was not in denomination
[2:21:25] it was not in church buildings not in
[2:21:28] associations but it was in the presence
[2:21:30] of the living god they had faith oh you
[2:21:33] say well brother tim glory to god we got
[2:21:34] faith we we we we have this doctrine
[2:21:37] here we have that doctrine we're we no
[2:21:40] they had faith to heal the sick cast out
[2:21:42] devils do miracles all the great
[2:21:45] promises jesus made that the first
[2:21:47] church held on to that was a lifeline
[2:21:52] what did he say when the son of man
[2:21:54] cometh will he find
[2:21:57] god's going to be looking for faith
[2:22:00] but if an insects ate it all off
[2:22:03] i made us a bunch of faithless powerless
[2:22:05] people whose only weapon is argument
[2:22:10] then we're going to find ourselves
[2:22:12] coming up start on that day
[2:22:15] amen especially when god promised i will
[2:22:17] restore
[2:22:19] amen oh my
[2:22:21] so so again he said the ever presence
[2:22:24] the ever presence of the living god is a
[2:22:27] lifeline of any church or any bunch of
[2:22:29] people the ever presence of the living
[2:22:31] god to perform and to do and to act and
[2:22:33] to live with the people as he did in the
[2:22:35] beginning if the presence of the living
[2:22:37] god brought a pentecost with power signs
[2:22:39] wonders brought a people so full of the
[2:22:41] glory of god so they shout and spoke
[2:22:43] with other tongues and went and martyred
[2:22:45] for the faith let's earnestly condemn
[2:22:47] for that faith until death sets us free
[2:22:51] amen
[2:22:52] earnestly contend for that
[2:22:55] so you see it's got to bear that if the
[2:22:58] original if his first branch brought out
[2:23:01] that vine was a pentecostal branch with
[2:23:03] power visions revelations healing
[2:23:05] sanctification
[2:23:06] uh the holy spirit the next branch will
[2:23:09] do the same thing
[2:23:11] so what should we look for a branch
[2:23:14] that's pentecostal branch with power
[2:23:16] visions revelations healings
[2:23:19] sanctification holy spirit
[2:23:22] if that was the first one the last one's
[2:23:24] going to do the same thing
[2:23:28] so if one of these devilish insects
[2:23:31] takes the bark off the tree
[2:23:33] an old man made rag or covered won't
[2:23:36] allow the sap into the trees the holy
[2:23:39] spirit will not flow through creeds of
[2:23:42] men
[2:23:44] so next thing you see the leaves are
[2:23:46] withered and that's why we can't have
[2:23:48] revival in our day is because of
[2:23:51] man-made rags on the tree
[2:23:55] the doctrine of the church
[2:23:57] if it wanna it won't allow the praises
[2:24:00] to flow
[2:24:01] given sweetness
[2:24:03] to the fruit
[2:24:06] you see
[2:24:08] it don't say
[2:24:10] it you know no listen to me it's really
[2:24:12] subtle it's slick it don't say days and
[2:24:14] miracles are passed it's too subtle for
[2:24:16] that
[2:24:17] it just say
[2:24:19] it just says that was for the prophet
[2:24:23] or i was just to vindicate the message
[2:24:26] you see
[2:24:27] this is not the season for miracles
[2:24:30] because we have the word now
[2:24:32] it's just another rag
[2:24:35] if it's the true doctrine
[2:24:38] it will let the life
[2:24:40] flow you see the problem with what
[2:24:43] people is calling the word
[2:24:46] they are calling the word is really a
[2:24:47] rag
[2:24:49] and it's put on by man to dress the
[2:24:51] wound made by the cankerworm
[2:24:53] it's not the word let me tell you what
[2:24:55] the word does the word heals
[2:24:57] the word performs miracles the word
[2:25:00] delivers
[2:25:01] the word casts out devils the word
[2:25:03] produces holiness
[2:25:05] the word produces joy somebody help me
[2:25:07] preach the word produces every promise
[2:25:11] in the word of god flows through the
[2:25:14] bark amen
[2:25:16] and by making the leaves where that they
[2:25:19] can move in the spirit
[2:25:21] and produce fruit
[2:25:24] on the branches
[2:25:28] now how do we know
[2:25:31] that it was the word in jesus day
[2:25:34] it cast out devils
[2:25:36] it opened the eyes of the blind
[2:25:38] it healed the sick
[2:25:40] it performed the miraculous it brought
[2:25:42] down the holy ghost
[2:25:44] how did we know it was a word in brother
[2:25:46] branham's day it brought the holy ghost
[2:25:49] it cast out devils it opened the eyes of
[2:25:52] the blind it healed the sick it
[2:25:54] performed the miracles how do you know a
[2:25:56] church is in the word today it brings
[2:25:59] down the holy ghost it cast out devils
[2:26:02] amen it saves the lost somebody help me
[2:26:04] preach it opens the eyes of the blind it
[2:26:07] heals the sick it performs the
[2:26:09] miraculous it manifests the carrot of
[2:26:11] christ that's how we know
[2:26:14] amen you see because it must produce the
[2:26:17] fruits of
[2:26:19] the root
[2:26:22] and the life of christ or the life of
[2:26:24] god comes right down to the roots here
[2:26:26] the root and offspring of david and
[2:26:28] begins to come up through the holy
[2:26:30] spirit then the denomination said days
[2:26:33] of miracles a path you don't have to
[2:26:35] speak with tongues today there's no such
[2:26:36] thing as baptism of the holy ghost
[2:26:38] there's no divine healing that was when
[2:26:40] the age gone it's gone long ago so
[2:26:42] here's the branches up here suffering
[2:26:46] but brother branham said he said i'm
[2:26:48] looking at a stump
[2:26:52] and i'm looking back to the original
[2:26:54] route
[2:26:55] and i'm looking to the stump that's been
[2:26:57] cut down
[2:26:58] and he said i'll die on this dump
[2:27:01] proclaiming this word i will restore
[2:27:05] saith the lord
[2:27:08] now that was your prophet he was saying
[2:27:10] i will die on this stuff this will be
[2:27:13] the last dying breath of my god is going
[2:27:17] to restore this church
[2:27:19] i'm going to have a bride in the evening
[2:27:21] time there's going to be signs and
[2:27:23] wonders there's going to be the
[2:27:24] miraculous there's going to be people on
[2:27:27] fire with god the joy of the lord the
[2:27:29] son of the king will be in their midst
[2:27:32] hallelujah and i'll tell you what i will
[2:27:35] not put up with any man-made rag on the
[2:27:37] tree
[2:27:39] hallelujah let me die in that same place
[2:27:41] he said my god doesn't come in my
[2:27:43] generation i'll die on the stump where
[2:27:46] the cankerworms eat too believing that
[2:27:48] jesus christ and his church and his word
[2:27:50] is the same yesterday today and forever
[2:27:52] i'll stand loyal on that stump and cry
[2:27:55] the hour will come god will restore his
[2:27:57] church to his former condition
[2:28:03] hallelujah
[2:28:06] what a wonderful word
[2:28:09] what a promise you can look at
[2:28:11] now what about you
[2:28:14] you may be
[2:28:16] a leaf on that tree
[2:28:17] a little twig on that tree
[2:28:20] you may
[2:28:21] have went through some things and been
[2:28:22] eaten down
[2:28:24] you may have been hurt and scared
[2:28:27] sin may have done his damage on your
[2:28:29] life
[2:28:30] but god said i will restore it
[2:28:34] saith the lord
[2:28:36] i tell you might be a backslidden church
[2:28:39] and cold and formal but let me just say
[2:28:41] to you god's not going to leave his
[2:28:43] bride that way
[2:28:46] there is a message of restoration amen
[2:28:49] amen uh no sir we are not going to go
[2:28:52] down in defeat
[2:28:54] amen oh my we're we're listen brother
[2:28:58] branham said what did they add they also
[2:29:00] added you don't have to get out and act
[2:29:03] like they did
[2:29:04] it don't give you joy and power and
[2:29:06] speaking in tongues and all these things
[2:29:08] you don't have to have it just make your
[2:29:09] confession and shake hands that's some
[2:29:12] poison dope of the devil if it made them
[2:29:15] act like that way when they took the
[2:29:16] medicine it'll make you act the same way

[2:29:56] without having emotions
[2:29:58] speaking in tongues and shoutings and
[2:30:00] praises of god and prophecies and
[2:30:03] manifestations they never did just get
[2:30:05] up and walk away and shake hands with
[2:30:07] the preacher and walk away there's no
[2:30:10] such place in the bible they ever
[2:30:13] receive ever was baptized outside of
