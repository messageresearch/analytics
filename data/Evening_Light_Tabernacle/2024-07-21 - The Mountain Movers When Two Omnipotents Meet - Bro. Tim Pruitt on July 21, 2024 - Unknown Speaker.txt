open up the pages of the Bible take the words Lord write it in our heart we ask it in jesus' name heal the sick among us those that are in need Lord touch them today those that are desperately needing a touch those that are desperately needing salvation and deliverance in their lives Lord there there are those with with habits and addictions things that are holding on to to them that will keep them from the promises of God I pray in the name of Jesus as the word Goes Forth that there will be Deliverance today in the Holy Name of Jesus we ask it for your glory amen and amen God bless you amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord together today amen aren't you glad to be here amen may he just minister to your heart today and reveal himself to you as only he can amen we're going to turn to Matthew chap 17 and verse 14 I read this scripture last week I want to read it again as we just speak further along on this thought today I'm going to speak on the mountain movers when two omnipotents meet amen Matthew 17 verse4 and when they had come to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying Lord have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic and sorely vexed and often times he falleth Into the Fire and off to the water and I brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him and then Jesus answered and said oh faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you you how long shall I suffer you bring him hither to me and Jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour then came the disciples to Jesus apart and said why couldn't we not cast him out and Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hence To Yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you and then turn with me to Mark 9:14 I just want to get a a little glimpse of this again from another gospel just one one phrase here verse actually and when he came to his disciples he saw a great multitude about them desribes questioning them and then finally before you're seated 2 Corinthians 4:17 for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding an eternal an eternal weight of Glory while we look not at things which are seen But at the things which are not seen but the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal amen God bless you as you're seated and as we look into the Unseen and the realm of of faith today and speaking on the word of God from these scriptures we spoke last Sunday about Jesus coming from the Mount of transfiguration and found his disciples here questioning or being actually questioned by a great multitude and as we spoke about that we realized they were not asking questions to learn nor asking questions in support of the the disciples but disputing with them and the and so you see again you you have a conflict that is going on as they are trying to deliver this child that is is Afflicted with the devil and and of course it this conflict be brings a war against their faith and and it quickly would dissipate and and be replaced with unbelief now unbelief is really faith that is aimed in the wrong direction so you again it's just the the Turning actually salvation is the Turning of the heart and and it turns you from doubt and unbelief unto faith in God and that's what salvation does and it removes your doubt and and it it it puts a firm belief in God because you of of a love for God you'll find that love and faith works together they're like husband and wife you know they are actually one but but they're two but one they work together for the same purpose now these in the crowd were were're arguing and we find today there is a crowd of Christian them today that argues against the the very power of the Holy Spirit the very working of the Holy Spirit and so there's there's much of doubt and questioning when it comes to the word of God and these things can affect us they can affect our own faith if we take let them take a resident within us and cause us to question or to doubt or to wonder or Ponder and so you see the Unseen Realm of the Holy Ghost which is the kingdom of God from which sons of God's rule from cannot be understood by the children of this world you will really never understand the Holy Ghost the kingdom of God until you are born again and and of course then you've experienced it so you begin then to understand it and yet with their wisdom the children of this world can out argue the children of light and for the the the Bible said Jesus even said the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light so you will always find they are wiser with their understanding with the with their thoughts of the word world that will always be um smarter in science and be you know far far ahead of anybody else on the especially the children of light the children of this world are more in tune with the trends of the day with science with learn knowledge while a Believer is in tune with the word of God and the Unseen Realm of the spirit the seen realm and the Unseen realm they always conflict as one goes solely by the five senses while the the Unseen realm understands and sees by faith and the Bible tells you that as Believers we are to walk by faith and not by sight but you see by arguing their wisdom the crowd was pulling the disciples from the realm of the spirit and the realm of reason and and rational thinking and this made the the disciples um Faith waver and become actually unbelief you see unbelief is is simply faith in anything but God's word so you see that's what really faith is I mean unbelief is it is just simply faith in anything else but God's word so you see I I want to say this about faith faith is not rational faith will make you believe that all things are possible that you are what God says you are and that you can have what God says you can have and you can do what God says you can do amen so faith is not rational at all faith is is very irrational it makes you believe that all things are possible and that you can do all things through Christ that empowers you and it'll cause a man like Abraham to Stager not at the promise of God but to praise God believing for a promise when his when the scene realm of his five senses declare what is what is so in the physical scene realm such as as his body is now dead amen that the deadness of Sarah's wound is real while Faith looks at the Unseen and declares it is so amen when your feelings and your sight and your other senses declare it is different you see Faith sees the Unseen realm amen Faith lives in the Unseen realm it does not abide here in the seen realm it believes for what you cannot see it believes for what you cannot feel for what you cannot hear or touch but you see Faith believes God Amen he believes God who is the invisible amen he is he believes god with and and that's exactly how Faith Works Faith Works in the Unseen realm now as I said faith is required and it is required to please God timid faith is reluctant Faith real faith faith is aggressive it is persistent it is like an invading Army surrounding a city they lay hold on eternal life it's like in the times of Jesus they would tear off a roof to get to him that's Faith you see there is an excitement there is a Divine eagerness to receive the inheritance for what is yours they're like an army taking it by force you see it's a spiritual War amen Satan walls the promises of God off from you fortifies it to keep you from possessing it he shoots fiery darts against your faith because your unwavering faith will plunge the sword of the spirit the word of God right into his heart so you see he he wants to keep you always on the defense and never get on the offense because as long as you are defending and warding doubts instead of operating in faith and plunging the sword amen he's got you cornered he's got you retreating he's got you [Music] hiding God wants you to use what you have now and of course you see Jesus said it ain't going to take a lot of faith just Faith just Faith as small as a grain of mustard seed am and that faith that little bit of faith is powerful and will move Big Trees it'll pluck them up cast them in the sea I'm quoting Bible amen it'll make mountains in moh Hills you see Adam did this we know this because the the the the the Hebrews tells us through faith through the word of God that God created the heavens and the Earth and the word of you see the word of faith cared out the word of command and Faith was the power that ignited the word and filled it with power you see and this is where two omnipotence meet your faith omnipotent power at God's word omnipotent power so here's where we want to look two omnipotence meat God's word with power amen the Bible said the word of God is quick that means it's alive it is powerful amen so there's power in the word but it's going to take Faith to come with the word and when two omnipotence meet mountains move hindrance get out of the way Deliverance take place you know I can preach all I want to that God's a Sav and he'll save you from your addiction from that drunkenness from that alcohol or he'll save you from tobacco or our habits or drugs or or pornography or whatever I preach all I want to of the word and his power but somebody's got to believe that and the moment your faith comes together with the word of God it's over addiction's over the power is broken now that's where two omnipotence meet your faith omnipotent power and God's word omnipotent power now you may question that but we'll talk about it a little more as we go along and I want you to get out of the crowd and come on the side of Faith now now originally mankind was empowered and placed in the Garden of Eden to carry out and represents God's Kingdom on Earth but man failed to represent God by sinning and he was cast out of the Garden of Eden where God exercised his rule the Bible tells us clearly in in Genesis 3:23 that the Lord was send Adam out of the Garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken and drove Dr him the man to the to the east of the Garden of Eden and place some cherubims with flaming uh swords to guard the way of the tree of life so the Garden of Eden as we look at it for a moment is a a picture of the Kingdom of Heaven or the center it was the center of God's government on Earth and since man was expelled from the Garden of Eden man lost his can ction he lost his connection with God he lost power and he lost the Garden of Eden and and the Garden of Eden the symbol of the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth became hidden now Jesus came from heaven when you couldn't go there he came down and Jesus came from Heaven to bring back Dominion oh hallelujah amen he came to bring Heaven's Kingdom and it's rule to man again now he would not restore he would not restore Eden to the Earth yet because all of those who would inhabit Eden would have to be reborn right amen those Flesh and Blood the Bible said cannot inherit the kingdom of God so we know sinful flesh can not inherit God's Kingdom so the only way to get into it is to be born again so Eden cannot come until the last one who is a child of God whose name is on the book is manifested up on the earth and is born again and then Eden can come on the Earth again now let's just picture it this way picture it this way I want you to think of it a minute and lock in just a minute there in the beginning when man fell he was the god of the earth he had Dominion he was the king and when man fell all beneath him fell so it wasn't just man that came under Satan's Dominion but it was the whole whole earth came in to Satan's Dominion now the only way to get the Earth back under God's Dominion is to bring restore man back as King again now so you see this is exactly what salvation is it's it's getting rid of the Dominion of Satan of sin upon your life who sits upon the throne of your heart is dethroning Satan and is installing another king and his kingdom his Dominion in your heart now so we let me just cover that thought again so Jesus came from Heaven to bring back Dominion Heaven's Kingdom and his rule to man he would not restore Eden to the Earth yet 2,000 years ago because all who would inhabit Eden would have to be reborn and the till the last one is reborn Eden cannot come back to the Earth but all who are reborn are born again would receive God's Kingdom on the inside and become New Creation therefore a new creature with old things pass away and All Things become a new amen that's the marvelous thing of a new of a new birth it changes your habits your ways amen everything about you changes from the inside out so the first thing he does is restore God back as the rule of the heart which begins to control this Earth this flesh we're worried about out here moving this mountain and and moving and caling this this to see is right here within you you want to bring this under Dominion amen we'll come into full Dominion later but I mean even right now our faith can move mountains but when you are spirit filled when you are born again then you become an Invader in Satan's kingdom and we have a purpose and that is to cast Satan out amen now in that great battle you know when when Jesus used the word to defeat the devil on the Mount of Temptation he would leave them after defeating him with the word he did it with the word so that all of us could do it he showed he was not going to be a certain gifted person you you know first first of all I I want you to get it out of your mind well Jesus can do it but we can't I I want you to understand Jesus was God's example son and every son is to be like him is that right amen so you know you say well he he he was always God no he laid aside his godship to become a man yeah amen he would even pray glorify me with the glory I had with you before the world began which is exactly the same thing you have to pray Lord glorify me with the glory that you had in mind of me in your mind before the foundation of the world glorify me with that Glory let me become that glorious I want to match what you thought of me now in that great battle when after Jesus came down off the mount Temptation after defeating the Devil with the word remember how he defeated the devil with faith in the word every time every time the battle started with a new thing come on Amen because he's the father of lies and he comes again he's speaking to he's he's the father of all the crowd so he speaking for the crowd and he is saying if thou be that's the first thing the devil will do to you when you're born again is question whether or not you really are who you are then he'll want you to prove it and I tell you how you prove it and that is is simply by staying with the word you don't have to do anything else but just stay with what God's word said and say I believe it not because I feel it now because right now I feel this ugly Spirit of a demonic presence amen I'm no longer feeling as Jesus standing there he was say I'm no longer feeling what I felt when he came down on the river and the heavens open and a Dove came I no longer have that feeling I'm feeling a different feeling yeah and the feeling I feel now is demonic it's a powerful Evil dark spirit and it comes to him questioning and now you say well I don't feel like it no more no you don't you're feeling that other come on look into the Unseen for a minute see what you're dealing with that Spirit of depression is nothing but the devil that Spirit of the enemy that says you can't make it you can never be what God says you you you can't overcome this addiction you you can't you see he's only afraid you're going to do it he knows as long as you disbelieve you will never rise up above it but the moment you start believing and to omnipotence God's word and your faith comes together that Mountain's got to move that enemy [Applause] got now Jesus would leave the Mount of Temptation after defeating the devil there and he would walk out into Satan's kingdom he would walk right out into the realm of the earth which he Satan is the God of this world he's the prince of the power of the air of atmospheres he is the prince of this world all of these are Bible terms about the devil how did he get to be that way not because God made him that way this Earth was never made for the devil this Earth was made for sons of God to have dominion over let me say to you your body your flesh your mind your spirit was never never made for the devil to rule you were created to be a son or daughter of God and the devil took a hold of you because of your first birth where you were born in the Sin but a new birth dethrones him and puts God back in control of your life which again can control your flesh and bring it subject to God now so now Jesus would leave the Mount of Temptation and he would immediately begin calling recruits I'm calling Apostles Apostles means one cent I'm going to commission me some men we're going to we're you know there's men that are gathered to me kind of like David's men you know from every kind of situation broken situations difficult you remember when when they gathered to David those men gathered to him those that were in debt those who had got out of prison those who had been in and was running from the king or this that all of these men gathered to David to make him King and that's what God did with you yeah he went looking for you amen he went to the son of man goes to seek and save that which is lost Jesus said I didn't come to cause the righteous repentance I called come to call those who realize I need a savior I need a deliverer and so he took you out of the dreads of humanity in the lowest of sin to make you it call you into his kingdom now Matthew 4:17 tells us from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand I I know we make that hard and we think what in the world is a kingdom the kingdom is the Holy Ghost it's his Dominion so he said men are about to be filled with the Holy Ghost repent get ready for it deity is about to come into people's lives get prepared for it the kingdom of God is about to come within men amen so repent for the Kingdom of Heaven same thing kingdom of God is at hand there's about to be an outpouring of the spirit get ready for it you know what men and women would do do that today amen get prepared for the outpouring of the Holy Ghost come on you need the Holy Ghost get prepared for it make room for it get ready for it repent turn from your wickedness now Jesus filled with the spirit now operates in the Unseen realm he doesn't use the Physical Realm he's not a doctor he doesn't go and examine diseases you know oh yeah well you got the he's he actually doesn't call them by scientific names he don't even use the terms he says th devil thou demon he not dealing with the physical thing he's dealing with the spiritual thing and so he from that time you know he filled with the spirit operates in the spirit realm and and he begins to cast Satan out I want you to see this in verse 23 of Matthew 4 Jesus went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues preaching the gospel of the Kingdom that's the good news of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of diseases among the people what's now and his Fame went throughout all Sy Syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with diverse diseases and torments and those who were possessed with devils and those which were lunatic and those that had py and he healed them he delivered them the first thing he does is begin to cast Satan out that's why I say the principal work of the church is to cast Satan out you're not stop preaching the gospel unless you're casting Satan out that's what happens at the alar when somebody gets saved Satan gets cast out that's what happens when the sick are healed Satan gets cast out not that they're Devils or demon possessed it's that that evil spirit has come and brought diseases and afflictions and healing cast him out and this is what Jesus began to do he began to come in as a just filled with the spirit oh I I want you to get this you just been filled with the spirit amen you have been equipped to cast Satan out amen you have been you have been ordained and commissioned to cast him out amen now so again again everywhere Jesus went he overthrew Satan's kingdom he attacked sin he attacked his counterpart sickness amen he he he cast out unbelief and doubt in every form some of it was in religious forms some of it was theology that had been falsely taught that the Bible calls it doctrines that demons teach that's right because that's what Satan does every time the word comes when a message comes Satan gets in it to do what distort it Adam and Eve received a message from God and Satan got in it to do what distort it to twist what God Said to put a question on it yeah has God said now this was to fulfill Isaiah's Words which we find in verse 16 the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region in the shadow of death light has sprung up let me tell you without Christ this is where you're at you are in the region and shadow of death amen and and you sitting in Darkness amen and the Lord the king of darkness is there with rule over your life but Jesus comes to bring light into your Darkness to give hope where there is no hope to give peace that the world cannot give Amen to pour out his blessings upon your life to take you from the dreads of humanity and set you as a son of God with sin and darkness under your feet now Jesus was not a conqueror like Alexander the Great who conquered the known world only be conquered by his own flesh and evil life he would die at 33 but this this young man Jesus Christ he died at 33 and conquered everything that could be conquered I want you to remember he is the king of kings so he leads in battle and when and so he came when he was on the earth he conquered passions he conquered Pride he conquered sickness he conquered devils and and he and when he died he even conquered death death had to become obedient to him and he rose up on the third day amen when he arose he conquered hell hell couldn't hold him he went he went up and conquered everything that was against mankind and tread The Wine Press of the wrath of God and and received God's Wrath poured upon him that was do you and he became your sin that you might become his righteousness and then he would he would conquer the all the atmospheres above because Satan is the prince of the power of the air and there he would cut that mist between God and man and connect Heaven and Earth back together again and God's got an army here on the earth I'm part of that Army now there on Calvary by dying he entered into the stronghold of death and there he conquered death hell in the grave and he took the the keys of death and Hell from Satan I want you to look at this as John saw him and his glorified condition in Revelation 117 he he when John sees him he he's so overcome by me he says he said fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen but I have the keys of death and of Hell amen here he comes the mighty conqueror amen he's rent the veil in two and says fear not and he lays his hand his right hand upon on John and and he says Don't Fear John I've conquered it all and I've come to tell you something I'm exalting you to godship I'm ex I've exalted you to sunship that not only have I overcome it but I've making you an overcomer amen now brother brandom speaks about these things and he says now I was about to choke this but I'm going to say it man is omnipotent what you knew God was I'm telling you man is omnipotent and then he says you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent oh I must not be fully surrendered to God well that's to receive the Holy Ghost you had to be fully surrendered so if you have the Holy Spirit in your life you are fully surrendered to God therefore omnip and he says did not he say in Mark 11:22 whatsoever thing you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you have said well that's omnipotence isn't it amen he said what happens when two omnipotence meet when God and man comes together through omnipotence something's got to Shake whatsoever you say with that creative power of omnipotence of God knowing that he promised and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not makes them as though they are because two omnipotence have met two omnipotence have met an omnipotent man surrendered to God in faith and his word coming together we've seen it work amen I I can start pointing them out throughout this audience we can start with sister Lanta and go all the way down amen we could go we could go to to Mariah with with with alpan in in incurable and healed by the glory of God what was it true omnipotence met and when they came together mountains moved amen trees were plucked up roots and all cast into the sea amen things that had roots in your life you know you know it's happened to you sir you know it did I mean you could not there was addictions you couldn't overcome there was things in your life that you could not rise above all the selfhelp hypnosis anything they want nothing could do but but one moment when you believe in his presence and those two opip come together even the root of it was drug out of your life and it was DED it from the root I want you to get the s this morning whatever you say with that creative power so well healing is not a creative power well tell me then what happens when one day we got a one day one day we got a black lung the next day a clear lung one day this one day next day that what happened a creation that creation can cause pancreases start to work in amen that creation can cause kidneys to start functioning and healthy cells come into them amen it happened with Jude come on Amen one day this way next day the crowd says oh yeah well we said yeah there was a problem we must have missed our diagnosis no there was no misdiagnosis amen creation had happened because two omnipotence met it can happen this morning the moment amen the moment your faith is released in that word word of God not in a preacher come on somebody in the word of God the moment that your faith is released things happen amen I shook hands the other day with brother James strong back there spoke to him just for a moment we exchange phone numbers just one moment just one moment of believing addiction since he was about in his early teens drunk every day since a man an alcoholic couldn't help himself one moment two omnipotence came together amen it you know it doesn't take even coming up and hands laid on you while the word is preached amen I I can recall a man there that went out and and left the word of God went out into sin he was he was went into a horrible condition and he came back into church and he's full of an addiction with with a cigarette habit he can't give up and as I'm preaching he screams out I'm delivered I'm delivered I'm delivered and from that Moment On never smoked another cigarette why was two omnipotence came together that's what happens when we preach when the word of faith is preached what happens people begin to believe and when when we believe demons have to leave only your unbelief can give them permission to stay the word of God says they have to leave to omnipotence I want to show you again here in this passage first of all we have the crowd they're saying what science says they're saying the impossibilities they're asking the disciples who do you think you are and who do you think this man you're calling Messiah is that gave you this Authority you didn't get it from Moses and you know you didn't get it from one of our prophets it didn't come out of our church church and they got all these accusation and first thing you know their faith is dropping being replaced with unbelief they're siding with the crowd but Jesus has already met the tempter himself and defeated him he knew who he was and he knew what his job was he knew what his position was we'll read it later but he knew his position because the word said he was this I want you to get it Jesus knew it not because of of of that he came with this knowledge he would leave the knowledge of godship to the point when they ask him as a human okay when are you coming back I don't know when's your second coming I I don't know why don't you know you're God no I'm a man and I put aside my godship to come and show you how God receiving God in a man can make you live I'm the first born of your race of a new creation and so I've laid aside my godship and so there are things I won't know till I go back to being God again when I sinned I'll come back and he comes to John on the aisle ofart of pmas and gives us a whole scope of his coming so there's going to be seven stars and seven churches these are written in symbols as as ages and here it will be in the last age in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of God would be finished and I I'm going to I'm going to delay my coming until the last day and then I'll break the Silence of it opening up that seventh seal which is silence and reveal my coming and I'm going to set it in motion I want you to know his coming is in motion the end time is in it is it is in cycle it is now we're in the cycle of the end time and every prophecy is pointing there Mr Trump I don't know what part he'll play I don't know what his Catholic running mate will play who's married to a Hindu I don't know all of all about what part they play but I'm reading in the Bible Nebuchadnezzar my servant and the other day when a Assassin's bullet tried to take came down it couldn't he still got a job to do I don't know what it is but all I know is we're in the end time and things are happening amen whe whether it'll be another defeat at the pole and that woman in purple that was there and in the inauguration there that brother Bram saw and and the and and behind them the Catholic Church which Joe Biden is I don't know I don't know exactly how it all will play but I'm looking at it I'm wondering I'm I'm reading the book I'm doing like Daniel did when it was time to go home and for the for the Exiles to return back I want to look at Jeremiah and he says what 70 years will be accomplished we're right at the time and I believe there should be a people in this moment seeking God and searching the word and say God what is our hour what is our day don't let me m your visitation but everything is coming right there right in the place now here we come the crowd they're screaming their unbelief and the whole world is screaming at out you'll never have a Rapture in this day what Jesus said we would you'll never get a bride ready well he said I'll have one without spot a wrinkle how's he going to do it I don't know I just know he's going to do it how do you know Abraham how's he going to I don't know I just know he's going to do it I just know even that that when Elohim came down and discerned the heart of Sarah and told her the promise he said I will come again according to is the time of life Hallelujah I don't know about you but I I'm seeing the return of the angel I'm seeing the stir of the Holy Spirit I'm seeing another surge as people hearts are starting to believe watch now that's the crowd the disciples are now in unbelief but now in order for this book boy to be healed in order for this devil to be cast out two omnipotents are going to have to meet and so in Mark chapter 9 verse 22 and oftimes the boy's father tells of times it has cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou can't do anything have compassion on us and help us now here's the man he's putting an if in part of in in front of the word if you can do anything you know that's the way that a lot of people approach God if you can God if you will I mean a leper asked him that one day and said Lord if I will I you can make me clean he said I will be thou clean it's just that simple church I mean it's his will it's his will to deliver he's a savior that's his job he's a savior he wants to save save you from that addiction save you from that sickness save you from that sin he's a savior now but if thou can do anything have compassion on us and help us now King James don't say it exactly like this but most of the rest of the translations agree with this and Jesus says if I can look at verse 23 if I can and then he says all things are possible to them that believe and so you see if they there again if th can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth he says if I can yeah I I've been sent for this it's my position but what I got to do is get you to believe it and the question isn't if I I can but if you will believe if I I I am I have the omnipotence I need you to step into omnipotence and the two when they meet things happen so if I can get you to believe cuz I need Faith to operate and straight way and this ought to be us this morning and straight way the father of the child DED out and with tears says Lord I believe help thou my unbelief that's where that's where you've got to come to every situation Lord to that point I believe God I believe it I believe what you said I believe you're the Healer I believe you're the deliverer I believe you can do I believe your word but help my unbelief now when those two omnipotence met God's words omnipotent and that's one omnipotence but like electricity we need two wires need two to come together so I want want you to see when that two came together the devil left amen the same thing will happen when those two omnivent meet Satan fleas the moment he meets with faith amen and faith in that father's word something's going to happen somebody with me now ammen let's go to John 11:21 and we're going to see Martha at the tomb of Lazarus and I want you to watch the battle between the crowd of man's thinking and the resurrection power of Jesus so now we're at the tomb of Lazarus or we're here with the family of Lazarus Jesus has went away because he could do nothing till the father showed him first he would see that he would know he would know when he died he said our friend elzar is asleep well if he's asleep the disciples said he's doing well said they didn't understand he man he was dead and Jesus shows up and they think he's 4 days late but he's right on time he's stepping right into the vision following there God will show now through him he has resurrection power power over death even four days dead amen so now here again Martha's he he he meets with Martha and and and of course you know she she's heard from the crowd All The Consolers well you you know he'll be in heaven and he's gone and you know he was a good boy and we we've given him a good funeral and we we've cried and we talked about all his deeds and everything else and and and here comes Jesus up and in John 11:21 Martha said to Jesus Lord if thou H has been here my brother had not died but I know watch now that even now now look I want you to see here Faith Rises up because Jesus has appeared and when you can see that Jesus is here then faith will rise and so she began to believe now because Jesus is here and she said but even now even now Lord whatever you ask God God will give it to you I'm confident in you I'm confident whatever you ask it'll be done oh I tell you what if the church this morning could realize Jesus is here well he said he was I said that he said he was he said where two or more Gather in my name I am there in their midst he does miss a church service even when you miss he's there he's there for you to call him on the scene he's there for you to recognize his presence he's there to for you to wash his dirty feet somebody help me preach to make him the welcome Christ to to entertain him to welcome him see Jesus is here and he and he says but I know that even now even now Lord whatever thou ask of God God will give you and Jesus gives the word watch now Jesus gives the word in verse 23 thy brother shall rise again I see they just said what do you ask God and Jesus said your brother will rise again Jus said even now Lord whatever you ask and Jesus says your brother will rise again now the word is released want did you get this it can't return him to him void amen Jesus has already spoken but I want you to notice now the word of the crowd now comes back and wars in her mind the Bible said you know you have to cast down reasoning and every High thing that exalts itself against the word of God a lot of high Things Are true things true as far as the scene realm goes well I tell you what I I I the doctor said I I don't have cancer yes you do yes you do faith is not denying faith says my God is able well I don't have this problem yes you do but just give it over to God don't go along pretending this is not pretending amen what we see in the in the in the five senses that what is declaring is declaring what they see taste smell or feel or hear and that's what the doctor is going by but we're looking in the Unseen realm where Jesus Paid It All amen and where we have the right to cast Satan out listen we're not dealing with the with the with the the symptom we are dealing with the spirit so Jesus says I mat said verse 24 now she Echoes the words of the crowd the crowd says I know he was a good boy he'll raise again in the Resurrection to the last day she immediately put her promise off way in the future she's just declared whatever you ask God and he said he'll Rise Again ah yeah I I I I know in the last days I know he'll rise again in the resurrection yeah he was a good boy he he'll come forth then but you know my brother's dead now it's too late you know but in the sweep by and by he will rise but it's impossible now he been dead four days but if you'd have been here you know if if we would have lived when Jesus walked the shores of Galilee we could have Miracles if we would have been in William Adam's day back in the 40s and 50s when the healing reviv we could have Miracles but I guess we'll have to wait for the Millennium I guess we'll have to wait until squeeze comes I guess we'll have to wait until we're adopted when are you going to realize your position in Christ that you are adopted that's what the token is it gave you adoption life a mature son or daughter of God filled with the holy spirit amen dress come on you don't dress an infant with a shield of faith and a helmet of salvation and the and good about your Lords that's a man amen quit you like men be men realize I'm no child I am a blood blood buffed son and daughter of the Living God matured by this word ready to take and go to battle [Applause] going to have to wait till I grow up let me tell you something just get born again get filled with the Holy Spirit that'll place you in the body of Christ as a son well I know someday this would be true one day we'll have the power one day you know but not now it's not here now what day the bride will be adopted and rise in power but not now one day when the third pool comes but not right now we have to place it all in the future and Jesus jerks her faith back and connects her faith back to the presence and he says in verse 25 I am the resurrection that's right the resurrection is here ien Resurrection Life is here right now I'm here I'm the now God not not tomorrow I'm the present God I am I am right here right now the I am that that I am don't put it in the future don't say someday right now one day we'll be sons of God right now you're sons of God Amen well one day you will have power over the enemy greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Jesus says I am the resurrection I am the life he's a life he's the lifegiver he's same one that breathe breath into Adam at the beginning he's the same one that gave you breath says I'm the resurrection and the life if I can get you to believe in me though he is dead yet shall he live if I can get you to believe in a present tense God this man though he were dead yet he will live it doesn't matter that deadness of Sarah's womb didn't matter to Abraham the Bible said he staggered not at it you say he didn't see it oh yeah he saw all the wrinkles he saw her crippled condition and what old age had done but he looked past that into the Unseen and he saw a young woman bringing forth a child and that woman materialized in such a child to such a young woman till a king wanted to marry her 90 years old Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this yes and she said what now here faith comes back together again yes Lord yay Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God which should come into the world so now she makes her profession now her faith is strong yes Lord I believe I believe you're the Christ I believe you're the Son of God I believe you're the one that should come in the world I've got full confidence you are the life you're the resurrection power and then Jesus walks up to the tomb now I'm want I'm want you to see and what the battle going back and forth and Jesus says in 112 39 I think it's 39 take away the stone now he knew that somebody had to do some part you got your part to do amen take away the stone that sin that lies at the door move the stone you want to see dead man walk come on got to move away the stone that's right you see men will put stones in front even of the lost and they would say oh Mercy's over you got to move that stone as long as you believe Mercy's over it is for you well I'll tell you I've sent away my day of Grace as long as you believe that and you keep that stone in there you can never have a resurrection you've got to believe it is far me it is not too late this is my moment amen it looks too late but God's right on time he has exactly the time brother Bram would get beyond the curtain at time and he would find a 90y old young now but a young woman beautiful who gave her life to Christ in his meetings at 90 years old long you know predestinated seats can go a long time before they're converted but he's going to get them goodness and mercy is on your Trail you can run you can hide you can go here you can go there you can commit it and the devil do every kind of thing to your life let the woman at the well and smear your life and wreck it and ruin it but let me tell you God Specializes and things thought impossible he'll do what no other power can do he'll reach further down than what you can look up he's God who'll get right down in the gutter where you are and bring you out and save you I don't know if I got another chance he's a god of first chances Second Chances third chances amen 10 chances 20 chances 100 chances you can't put a number he's a god rich in Mercy a god rich in Grace men will try and put a stone up there and bring some chronic Creed or dogma and say Mercy is now over and nobody else can come in but you see when he opens a door no man can shut it and when he shuts it no man can open it man does not have the [Applause] power you got your part to do you got to move back to Stone you got to move back that unbelief that lays at the door that's holding your promise from you you got to put your faith to work you got to release your faith without works faith is dead a lot of dead Faith laying around but he's resurrection and the life now then here's still the battle and Martha the sister of him that was dead said to him Lord by this time he stinketh he's been dead for days now there's a war between the word and the reasoning and the eye and the senses that and what the eye and the senses can see and the impossibilities are now stated he's been dead four days and his body is rotten now he [Music] stinks we dare not roll away the stone we'll suffocate with the smell coming out of that tomb I tell you what you know there's a lot of smelly things in a dead man's tomb Hallelujah but God ain't ain't caring about how your sin smells and how rotten you are and how l in sin and what a wretched man or woman that you are God ain't caring about that he is the resurrection and the life he is greater than the stink in your life Hallelujah I don't care what the devil has done to you and what kind of dreads of humanity you've been down in amen this God don't care about your stink in one moment he can take your stink away that's now this war between the word what the reason I can see the senses is declared we can't roll away that stone everybody see it everybody smell it that's things in my life that I'm ashamed of I've been a wretched sinner I'm a dead the Bible says you're dead the Bible said you're dead in sin and every one of you have been dead amen but dead men are now walking Hallelujah there's many elus out of the Tomb this morning who can and say like Jesus I once was dead but now I am alive and I have the key to open any door that Satan would want to try to stop me because I am blood B Blood Washed redeemed watch now this war between the word and reasoning and Jesus said now the word comes again said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should see the glory of God didn't I tell you that you're looking at the symptoms you're looking at how bad off is nobody's ever raised him to that yeah you you raised him with a son and name before she be you you you you before he was buried you raised the little girl that there at Gus's daughter before she was buried but this man ain't nobody ever been 4 days and his soul was four days journey and Jesus had to go get it in the Unseen and say here come back here your time's not up on Earth I've got a purpose I'm going to preach the gospel through you hallelujah amen I I tell you what he went forth after that and his his life Lazarus life would preach the gospel that man was dead that's that dead man that's that man that was addicted that that's that man that woman that was in sin that's that Harlot out there that's that woman that Hallelujah but there you know again when Lazarus shows up at a at another meeting of Jesus they want to kill Lazarus what devil is you couldn't kill him the first time you can't kill him the second time amen if God can raise him up once he can raise him up again but what about you he'll raise you up and seal you to the day of redemption till Satan's sealed out and you're sealed in Jesus said didn't I tell you I need someone to believe and if you believe you'll see the glory of God if we'll believe we can have whatever we ask amen if we can get you to believe your lost family is going to be saved prodal will come home the angel of the Lord will go get him Hallelujah the angel of the Lord will go get up and say I've had enough of this sloth I've had enough of a pig's life I am not that anymore I I have a father and I'm going home I tell you friend he'll welcome you home he'll bring you there he'll put a robe up on you and a ring on your finger and restore you to sunship finally he gets him to do what he ask him to do they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank you because you've hurt me and the Bible said he only prayed that way for their sakes CU he already knew he had been hurt of the father said I thank you that you've heard me and he called Lazarus come forth and a man who was dead four days came out I tell you there was such power in that word I'm talking about this word now this is God in printed for amen there's enough power in this word that if he had not have said Lazarus all the dead would have risen in fact he proved he could do that because when he rose all the dead of the Old Testament Saints rose with him now without unbelief out the way Jesus thanks God for the resurrection by power before he even sees it happening he thanks him for the miracle thank you Father you've Hur me you know that's the way you've got to pray you got to pray believing God heard you amen you you said well I spoke it in the seen realm but it was heard in the Unseen realm come on Amen there again Jesus thank thank God for the resurrection Miracle before even seen it happen and that's the way with you you got to start thanking God before you even see it happen you want the Holy Ghost well I tell you look and see the Promise for you repent of your sins and go to thanking God for he'll fill you with the Holy Ghost when you come with that Assurance with that with that knowledge of his word I'll give you the Holy Ghost I will not give you a serpent or a stone I will give you as a good father would give the Holy Ghost to everyone that ask see that's when two omnipotence meet when one omnipotent now I'm quoting from Brother bradam from uncertain sound when one omnipotent she had she had omnipotent faith in Christ and Christ was omnipotent but I want you to stop for a minute you say well if I have a battle that don't mean I have it no that means Satan's pretty sure you got it so he tries this side and he tries that that punch so he comes to Jesus and said if thou be and Jesus defeats him with the word well if you had a battle stop for a minute many of you worry about Temptation I'm tempted to do wrong well I guess you always will be Satan's going to come he's going to tempt you all the time but we don't yield to Temptation we come against him with the word Jesus was tempted of the devil so will you be tempted of the Devil he's going to come to you today this week whenever he will come and he will come and he'll lay Temptations for you it happens to me all the time it happens all the time I have to turn my head like every other man does amen I have to resist evil like every other person does I get stupid thoughts just like you get you think while you're holy and you're way up here no I I am up here and I am Holy but I also have temptations said brother Tim you're bragging on your I'm bragging on Jesus the Bible said he had made us to sit in Heavenly places amen that is high places amen he has positioned me in him watch now the these omnipotence these omnipotence she had she had omnipotent faith in Christ and Christ was omnident he said she had perfect infinite faith in Christ that he was the Lord and knew whatever he would ask God God would give him in other words you just speak the word and that's all you have to do whatever you have to ask whatever you ask God God will give it to you that's omnipotence all powerful because he just said so and all right and he was all powerful and that's when two Powers two omnipotent Powers meet together it's a contact then then when a line here has got 150 volts and this is has 150 volts they come together and you you got 10050 volts both ways and when you have supreme power when Jesus said let hands on the sick and they shall recover and you got supreme faith and that being the truth you need a supreme god that made a promise and a supreme result will happen will come amen now I believe we're living a day where faith is rising I believe in a people who's having Rapture in faith and I'm speaking that over you right now we're are people of a Rapture and have Rapture in faith somebody's beginning to believe somebody's beginning to have faith and brother brother Brandon spoke about this injunction of time he said we're at the end time we're going into the Millennium every hand is pointing that way the old clock is ticking about two minutes to midnight omnipotence is speaking angels are appearing prophets are coming prophets are prophesying Visions are being poured out upon the people of this day and the gospel is preached and the sick is being raised up and the blind sees the death hears the devils are rages impersonators Janice and jambes are here but omnipotent speaks I'm going to just come down toward the end of things and I just want to say say Jesus said with that little Mustard Seed of Faith nothing shall be impossible unto you I just quoted Bible I've just quoted the words of Jesus nothing shall be impossible to you you see faith is powerful Faith created the world come on say well the word did no faith in the word created The World God had faith in his own word that's what he's trying to get you have faith in what he said amen and have faith in what he said you are now notice Faith the Bible tells you in Hebrews 11:33 that Faith subdued kingdoms it wrought righteousness it obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions it quenched the violence of the fire it escaped the edge of the sword it out of weakness was made strong it wa valan and fight it turn to flight the armies of the alien and face P power even raised the dead to life again so that's What Faith Can Do when two omnipotence meet let me just bring this to a moment and I want to talk about where we are right now in the service because in this service every time I preach I'm I am here for battle and I'm Waring against unbelief even evil spirits doubt confusion and I'm attacking it I'm not waiting for the enemy to come and bring the attack to you I am attacking the enemy now I want you to think of this brother bradam told us this in in a message called believe in God he said he commissioned his church to cast The Devils out there you are in my name they shall cast out Devils now you're not going to heal anybody but you're going to cast The Devil away from them so they can accept the healing I've already done and he said preacher stand on the platform and preach the gospel and devil scatter that's exactly what happened you get up and you preach the word and faith comes by hearing the word preached and devil scatter amen because they cannot stay stand in front of Faith they cannot stand in front of belief when you start believing the man come to the altar under conviction say I want to get saved the preacher never saved the man he cast out the devil and the man got saved that's what I've been been busy doing this whole service this morning is casting Satan out casting out the words of the crowd telling that telling you Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's the now God the resurrection and the life no matter what condition you're in no matter if you're four days dead rotten in the Tomb amen his power can resurrect you and bring you into life he said the same thing by Divine Healing you sick people here this morning believe that and have been born again our sons and daughters of God Christ has already healed you the only thing that keeps you from being well this morning is a spirit hanging over you that won't let you that won't fully let you go out yonder and believe God's promise that he's done it hold that now here's what's Happ let's look at the Unseen you're looking at the seen you're looking for days dead he stinks you're looking at the rotten circumstances God's wanting you to turn and look in the Unseen and see that there's a spirit hanging over you that won't let you fully accept God and believe his promise that he's done it so he's there right there attacking your mind right there bringing reasoning bringing the voice of the crowd all of the things are against your mine Waring against you it ain't for me I don't feel nothing today this ain't the day for it well you know is a haunting Spirit now brother bradam says a sinner come to the Altar and say brother bradam I want you to pray for me I want to be good and he said will you pray you know please will you pray brother Brandon will you pray for me pray for me he goes back to seat next night you say how many wants to be saved here he stands up you want to be saved young man yes sir well why don't you get saved I don't know and he says the devil is holding that boy he wants to do right but there's a spirit of power that won't let him do right please now Zone in now walk in the devil's holding that boy why want he do right the devil's holding it he wants to do right but there's a spirit a power that won't let him do right now Hallelujah he says here it is no wonder if God would never let a true man of God ever say he could heal somebody Christ did that when he died I couldn't save nobody or no one else can save anybody but God can and God can't save you because he's he already done it and the reason the only thing you have to accept it it's already done I wasn't saved 20 years ago I was I was saved 1900 years ago but 20 years ago I received it and accepted it if it hadn't the first sin I'd done God would have wipe me off the face of the Earth because he said he would and he has to give his promise I was healed 1900 years ago but I've got to accept it now watch this and the only thing that kept me from being saved when I was 12 years old I stop here there's people in the church right here this morning you were here at 12 years old or maybe you was in another church 12 years old the only thing that kept me from being saved when I was 12 why 12 it's the age of accountability it's the age that Jesus was where he started doing father's business it was the age where you come and you are responsible before God for your sins you're no longer under your your parents your under under your parents now you're accountable and he says I would the only thing that kept me from being saved when I was 12 was because because a spirit hung over me a devil saying wait a little longer I want to ask you how has that worked out for you heartache divorce drugs alcohol prostitution all kinds of things it didn't work out so good did it brother Johnny by not accepting the Lord when you was 12 didn't work out so good for you did it took your life down into Life Of Heartache didn't it you want want want to see any 12y old to go down that path do you if that's not just him that's you and you and you and you but a spirit hung over you and pulled you into the crowd that same crowd of unbelief that was screaming at the disciples when they were given a commission and power and authority to cast Satan out but now he comes from the crowd and the crowd's voice lured you out you walked with the crowd to do evil because a spirit hung over you that said wait a little longer and that's the reason you wasn't saved when you come to the age of accountability and spirit got with the crowd that hovered over you and kept hanging over you you wanted to do right and that's the truth there's not a person that doesn't want to do right you want a good home you want a good marriage you want you you want to be a loving kind you want to be a good father a good mother come on you want that you you want that you want to do right there's not a person in the right mind but what wants to do right but there's something won't let you do right and that's the devil but your salvation's paid for but you got to quit listening to the crowd I want you to Bow your heads musicians come the Bible tells you never follow a crowd to do evil and you followed the crowd oh they were smarter it was a better way how did it work out for you the way of a transgressor is hard and if you continue in that transgression it will only get harder I've wandered far away from God I'm coming home [Music] a spirit hanging over you they want to
