[38:20] the top I I stood up and I said I am a
[38:25] son of God amen
[38:28] I'd like to just take a simple thought
[38:31] for just a little bit this afternoon
[38:34] take it back for brother Josh this
[38:41] should be a special spot to start from
[38:43] for Samuel chapter 25 and verse 3
[39:03] my voice goes completely out brother
[39:05] Wayne will be taking over for me so
[39:11] brother Wayne will be praying for me
[39:12] more than anybody in the building now
[39:22] the name of the man was Mabel and the
[39:27] name of his wife was Abigail now I want
[39:33] you to just watch this just for a moment
[39:35] this is what God thought of her I would
[39:38] like to be complimented like this and
[39:40] she was a woman of good understanding
[39:44] and of a beautiful countenance I like it
[39:48] when God tells us were beautiful but the
[39:55] man was Kurdish and evil in his doings
[39:59] and he was of the house of Caleb turn
[40:05] with me to First Samuel chapter 30 and
[40:07] verse 1 and it came to pass that when
[40:17] David and his men were come to see glad
[40:19] on the third day that the Amalekites had
[40:25] invaded the south and zyg leg and
[40:28] smitten zyg leg and burned it with fire
[40:31] and taken the women captives that were
[40:35] there in they slew not any either small
[40:40] or great but carried them away and went
[40:44] on their way and David and his men came
[40:48] to the city and behold it was burned
[40:51] with fire and their wives and their sons
[40:55] and their daughters were taken captives
[40:58] and David and the people that were with
[41:02] him fill their voice and lifted their
[41:06] voice and wept until they had no more
[41:10] power to
[41:12] we have you ever been there in your life
[41:16] till you came to a valley until you come
[41:25] to a spot to where you had no more power
[41:29] to mourn or to weep or had a word to say
[41:36] and David's two wives were taken
[41:41] captives him and the Jezreel is and
[41:45] Abigail the wife of night ball that
[41:48] comer light and David was greatly
[41:52] distressed for the people speak of
[41:58] stoning him because the soul of all the
[42:01] people was greed and every man for his
[42:05] sons and for his daughters notice these
[42:09] words but David encouraged himself in
[42:13] the Lord his God you may be seated to
[42:18] see me we read a lot of chapters of
[42:29] David in new year we see a lot of
[42:31] victories we see some Wars David was
[42:34] also honest and told us of the defeats
[42:36] and the horrible things that he had to
[42:39] go through in his life this was a tough
[42:42] spot David was exiled he was running he
[42:48] was in a difficult spot to start off
[42:50] with he's fighting enemies at every
[42:52] captive they're single at every
[42:55] situation he was back was against the
[42:57] wall and he's has men that have gathered
[43:03] with him you know if you want to know
[43:06] what kind of a person you are look
[43:09] around at what God gathers to you God
[43:15] mighty men that were around him men that
[43:19] were willing to fight willing to give
[43:22] their life willing to give everything
[43:24] that they had because they believed that
[43:27] David was on his way to be the king they
[43:33] were following his leadership they were
[43:36] following him pass he was making his way
[43:38] and they believed that he was ordained
[43:41] of God they believed he was elected and
[43:44] they believed he was anointed of God and
[43:48] they get into a battle to which that
[43:51] they are going to win and they're going
[43:53] to have incredible victory and they're
[43:55] away from their wives and their homes
[43:57] and and they're away from everything
[44:00] that they loved and they went to battle
[44:02] with David the king and they have smoked
[44:06] the enemy and they have rejoiced and
[44:09] they danced and they took balls and now
[44:13] they're on their way back now there's a
[44:16] lot of different kind of enemies that we
[44:18] have to fight in this day just like
[44:21] David had to fight and Philistine is one
[44:25] that will meet you out front he is the
[44:29] one that will call your bluff he's the
[44:31] one that will scream at you and holler
[44:34] at you and blabbered to you you remember
[44:38] there was one like that that we could
[44:40] pronounce in the scriptures that tells
[44:42] us that there was a Goliath and Goliath
[44:45] was screaming is there anybody over
[44:49] there that will come and meet the
[44:50] challenge of the Aleph and they had all
[44:53] kind of fun of God and all whole fun of
[44:56] the children of Israel and you know come
[44:58] I could do that all that he wanted to
[45:00] until David showed up
[45:04] Laodicea can scream all she wants to
[45:08] until the bride of Jesus Christ stand to
[45:12] her feet and realizes that she's the
[45:15] invincible army on the earth in this day
[45:27] David was fighting these kind of men but
[45:31] there was another kind of an enemy
[45:32] called an Emily cot that's the con that
[45:36] will sweep him behind you while you're
[45:41] away fighting wars while you're away
[45:44] having victories and he'll come into
[45:48] your house he'll come to your house and
[45:54] try to steal your children and steal
[45:58] your life steal your home and try to
[46:03] destroy your courage let me just talk to
[46:07] you a little bit about your home it is
[46:10] the place that God gives you as a
[46:12] sanctuary it's a place that where you
[46:16] apply token and then it's a place away
[46:19] from the world it's a place that you
[46:22] don't want to have to put up with
[46:23] worldly women and all kind of worldly
[46:26] music and all kind of demon spirits it's
[46:29] a sanctuary it's a sanctuary to where
[46:33] you can enjoy your wife and enjoy your
[46:36] children and a place to where you can
[46:39] rest you can have the battles out in the
[46:42] world but you can come home and be
[46:45] yourself
[46:48] come on you can take your armor off for
[46:51] a little bit you can take your helmet
[46:54] off a little bit you can set down your
[46:57] couch and enjoy your wife and enjoy your
[47:01] children but it takes a dirty rotten
[47:06] devil that will come and try to steal

[47:21] home it's a three-day journey they're on
[47:25] their way home you know there's just
[47:27] something about going home it's kind of
[47:29] like a meeting like this but after you
[47:33] come toward the end you start making
[47:34] your way home there's something about
[47:37] going home an old horse can work in the
[47:40] field all day long but when he
[47:42] recognizes this I'm going to the barn
[47:45] touch these ears up the shoulders kind
[47:48] of stretch back he's ready to go home
[47:51] you kind of feel that way after a long
[47:54] day's work it's like a resurrection
[47:56] happens
[47:59] do you work eight ten twelve hours and
[48:02] all of a sudden you know you get ready
[48:04] to go home
[48:05] your wife's there with iced tea and
[48:08] she's going to meet you at the front
[48:10] door and she's gonna hug your neck and
[48:12] you're gonna sit down on the couch it
[48:15] and she's gonna climb up on your lap and
[48:17] and hug you and make you feel good
[48:20] that's a quote
[48:22] I just gave you a quote
[48:27] not my world oh yeah somebody on the
[48:35] same man somewhere well we had me not
[48:47] the church on time tomorrow now when
[48:56] they come across the hill they saw smoke
[49:11] you know smoke in the enemy's camp it's
[49:14] one thing smoke at your house is a
[49:19] different thing let me say it again
[49:27] smoke at the enemy's camps one thing
[49:30] smoke at your house is a different thing
[49:34] you know what it happens to somebody
[49:39] else's well you tell them I'll pray for
[49:41] you I'll encourage you I've done a lot
[49:45] of things for you but what about when it
[49:48] happens at your house now let me just
[49:53] drop back David's the king but he's
[49:58] gathered some treasures in his life
[50:00] we've all gathered some treasures that
[50:02] we think a lot of but there's no
[50:06] treasure like a man's wife now the woman
[50:11] that he has gathered is one of his wives
[50:14] being under different dispensation but
[50:18] there was a lady named Abigail that
[50:21] would come into David's life let me just
[50:25] talk to you for a moment about her
[50:27] Abigail her first husband was cruel to
[50:33] her
[50:34] he was an outer worshipper he was a
[50:38] college man he was a brutal beast he did
[50:44] not appreciate what he had the
[50:47] Scriptures talks about that abigail was
[50:51] a woman of good understanding if you do
[50:55] any study there's only just a couple of
[50:58] women in the entire scriptures that God
[51:01] calls wise so this woman is not only
[51:06] beautiful but she's brains too I wanted
[51:14] to talk to you just a moment about your
[51:16] first husband your first husband your
[51:21] nature he was brutal he was an idol
[51:26] worshiper he was cruel to you he meets
[51:31] you and mulch you and make fathered you
[51:34] and he never told you who you really was
[51:38] that you were the queen of heaven that
[51:41] you were the daughter of God but one day
[51:49] one day extract your life
[51:53] [Applause]
[51:54] if we could only realize it don't have
[51:57] to be that way this woman though she be
[52:08] serving under him had respect for him
[52:11] the king would have destroyed them had
[52:15] it not been for her incredible wisdom
[52:20] amazing God knows how to get us but not
[52:26] only does God know how to get us he
[52:29] knows how to keep us with me now
[52:37] she is one of the women with the
[52:41] children that when the enemy came he
[52:45] didn't kill him but he took him away
[52:48] captive and then taken away captive he
[52:53] takes some as a treasure as a hostage
[52:56] as a trophy that's what sake wants to do
[53:01] young people adults no matter your age
[53:04] he'd not to take you captive he with me
[53:11] but I want you to remember just one long
[53:14] letter that she was the wife of Nepal
[53:17] she was still in God's mind the wife of
[53:22] David she was still in God's mind a
[53:26] captive to the Amalekites she was still
[53:29] in God's mine
[53:30] god never forgets shoes he never forgets
[53:38] you David looks over though this city
[53:45] that once was the scripture said that
[53:51] they wept until they can't wait no more
[53:57] they was overwhelmed at their loss they
[54:01] was overwhelmed at how difficult this
[54:05] moment was reaching to somebody
[54:11] sometimes we come to a spot in our life
[54:16] until the moment is so difficult without
[54:22] the help of God we can't make it through
[54:26] it David's a key he feels the
[54:39] responsibility of leadership
[54:42] he's got generals captain's foot
[54:47] soldiers each one of them have suffered
[54:51] the same loss so he don't only have loss
[54:57] for himself he has lost for everybody
[55:00] else everybody takes grief a different
[55:07] way what if I was in those shoes this is
[55:12] what I do really but what about the
[55:15] whole place under the same situation now
[55:24] we do what humans do we blamed somebody
[55:32] we've been ready to blame somebody
[55:35] and so we blame the pastor we blame King
[55:41] David because we're in this situation
[55:47] this is a familiar story Jesus if you'd
[55:51] have been home Jesus if you'd have been
[55:57] home our brother would not have died
[56:04] brother Brandon if you want no honey you
[56:07] can appraise for this one in the
[56:08] hospital but there was a caribou that
[56:11] had to be killed and a grizzly bear that
[56:14] had to be killed we look through our
[56:19] selfish eyes because of our situation
[56:22] and then our moment overcomes us I'm
[56:27] gonna get there in just a moment hang
[56:28] with me they even speak of stoning him
[56:39] the man only a few days ago they were
[56:43] fighting a powerful turning with their
[56:47] eyes looking to make sure he would be
[56:48] okay looking across the hill and
[56:52] watching for David in the battle is he
[56:55] okay and they're finding them they're
[56:57] killing the enemy and they're looking to
[56:59] see David is okay and now the enemy
[57:01] started their ear the enemy's got their
[57:05] ear and blaming the preachers because of
[57:11] my trouble it's the preachers fault it's
[57:15] God's fault can I preach to you tonight
[57:19] listen this is what God made on my heart
[57:21] here we are it's hard for me to imagine
[57:29] that you'd start writing blogs against
[57:36] the messenger that was sent to deliver
[57:39] you
[57:47] it's hard to believe that you'll come to
[57:50] a spot to work because of the failures
[57:54] of life and the failures of your home
[57:57] that you would want to destroy the
[58:00] message that has been sent to deliver
[58:03] you
[58:11] these men were fighting for David and
[58:15] they had their eyes on David the reason
[58:20] people get disappointed he's got their
[58:22] eyes on a man
[58:27] why is all of these camps and the
[58:29] message got disappointed they got their
[58:32] eyes on a man and when the Amalekites
[58:36] came and destroyed their home they
[58:38] forgot about God who is the resource of
[58:43] all of our friends now I want you to
[58:52] just notice here but David encouraged
[58:58] himself in the Lord his God I want you
[59:06] to understand tonight you got to come to
[59:08] a spot to where you encourage yourself
[59:16] but there's not a preacher man there's
[59:19] not a meeting that's going on you got to
[59:21] stop and you got to go back to this
[59:28] right here not to your website but go to
[59:35] these sites
[59:37] and encourage yourself read your name in
[59:43] the books read your spot in the books
[59:49] reading right here this is my spot

[1:06:02] Lord and to inquire nice simple notices
[1:06:05] next words for in the time of trouble

[1:06:15] me in his pavilion in the secret of his
[1:06:18] Tabernacle Shelley hide me and he shall
[1:06:21] set me upon a rock and now shall my head
[1:06:24] be lifted up above my enemies round
[1:06:27] about therefore will I offer in this
[1:06:30] Tabernacle sacrifices of joy I will sing
[1:06:35] they I will see them to the court but
[1:06:43] one but you know hunter I've served the
[1:06:48] Lord and all I can see its mistakes I
[1:06:53] look around him
[1:06:55] I see mistakes and David we're having
[1:06:58] been away a house wouldn't have been
[1:06:59] destroyed it you know if David makes the
[1:07:03] mistakes that he's made we wouldn't be
[1:07:04] destroyed I looked in the scriptures and
[1:07:07] I can't see it myself I'm looking by the
[1:07:08] branch message and I see mistakes and
[1:07:11] you know I was I was promised a double
[1:07:15] portion God always keeps his promise I'd
[1:07:23] like to remind you that you are who you
[1:07:27] are because God said who you are and
[1:07:31] where you get in trouble is you start
[1:07:34] having unbelief about what God said to
[1:07:37] us
[1:07:39] Jesus looked at the scriptures to see
[1:07:42] what it said about him
[1:07:44] you listen to sermons listen to the
[1:07:48] prophet of God and read this to see what
[1:07:51] it says about you and then you believe
[1:07:55] what God said about you and you take the
[1:07:58] oddities word one time there was two men
[1:08:03] that was welcomed together you're right
[1:08:06] there was two men that was walking
[1:08:09] together what had been the mightiest
[1:08:13] prophet in all of Israel there were
[1:08:19] schools of the message that was around
[1:08:22] that thought they had better
[1:08:24] interpretations but this man only kept
[1:08:28] his eyes on the Prophet guys were
[1:08:32] telling just stop he's going to be going
[1:08:34] away
[1:08:35] just stop he kept his eyes on the
[1:08:38] Prophet this prophet had incredible
[1:08:41] major miracles to happen in his life and
[1:08:46] this man named Elisha was following him
[1:08:49] and he just kept his eyes on the message
[1:08:53] because he knew the message had power
[1:08:55] within it he was kind of like Ruth just
[1:09:00] stay in the field in each just stay
[1:09:04] there don't go nowhere else just stay in
[1:09:05] the field and eat so he kept his eyes on
[1:09:09] Elijah Elijah tried to get him
[1:09:13] discouraged and maybe go somewhere else
[1:09:14] he kept his eyes on finally one day they
[1:09:18] have a conversation what is your desire
[1:09:21] I want to dump a Porsche
[1:09:29] of what you got the scripture said
[1:09:33] greater is He that's in me than he
[1:09:35] that's in the world I want that
[1:09:38] description said is he about in me and
[1:09:41] my words abide in you I won't touch the
[1:09:45] scripture said greater than these showed
[1:09:47] you do I want that the scripture said
[1:09:51] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:09:53] recover I love the scripture said
[1:09:57] there's going to be a resurrection I
[1:09:59] love that this picture said there's
[1:10:02] going to be a rapture I want I want
[1:10:06] everything in the book what what you're
[1:10:14] asking for is a hard thing but if you
[1:10:21] see me when I go so they came down to
[1:10:29] the body of water and they come to that
[1:10:33] place a larger took his coat off and he
[1:10:40] smoked the water and they walked across
[1:10:42] a lot ship believed it so he walked with
[1:10:48] him and they went over to the other side
[1:10:53] and you see Elijah was looking in this
[1:10:57] meeting that he was getting into half
[1:10:59] and there was chariots parked at every
[1:11:02] bush
[1:11:05] brother Brendan setting left those other
[1:11:08] chariots for me and you
[1:11:21] and he climbed up inside his chariot I
[1:11:25] didn't begin to go up and as it was
[1:11:31] going up Elijah stood there then Elijah
[1:11:36] took these mantle off he fell right down
[1:11:43] from Elijah now better Brendan said this
[1:11:47] he said God did not cut the rope
[1:11:52] to fill Elijah he cut Elijah to fit the
[1:11:57] role
[1:12:02] it's not will this message fit you it's
[1:12:06] will you set the match suits
[1:12:14] there will be a bride
[1:12:18] there will be an invincible army that
[1:12:22] will be wise I happen to be one of them
[1:12:26] [Applause]
[1:12:32] now hemming in here this building has
[1:12:37] had a critic let's go ahead and raise
[1:12:46] her hands had a critic how would you
[1:12:54] look around
[1:12:55] Blaine raise a mic up this is an
[1:12:59] exercise class after church I want to
[1:13:07] meet you that don't have any critics I
[1:13:12] want you to write a book on how to live
[1:13:15] life without a critic but let me just go
[1:13:20] ahead and answer the question before
[1:13:23] Gentiles people that have no critics
[1:13:25] have done nothing
[1:13:40] and whether you know it or not the
[1:13:41] critic is actually what makes you the
[1:13:43] masterpiece I know one horse I hope it
[1:13:54] got through the critic actually won
[1:13:56] testifies that you're a masterpiece no
[1:14:09] Elijah no doubt when he came back he
[1:14:13] took the road and smoked the same body
[1:14:16] of water he had asked for a double
[1:14:19] portion wonder how those people knew
[1:14:23] that he was going to get a double
[1:14:24] portion he testified about it
[1:14:31] that's what your critics do they listen
[1:14:34] to your testimony and you only testify
[1:14:38] what the word says about you so he walks
[1:14:43] back to the same body of water and he
[1:14:45] says these words where is the nor God of
[1:14:50] Elijah the same God that lived in Elijah
[1:14:57] what Jesus Christ and that same God that
[1:15:02] lived in that body lives inside of you
[1:15:07] [Applause]
[1:15:09] [Music]
[1:15:11] [Applause]
[1:15:20] what
[1:15:21] and then another miracle happens - and
[1:15:26] then another miracle happens through
[1:15:29] then American other miracle happens soul
[1:15:35] and Elijah comes to a spot in his life -
[1:15:39] where he's now getting weak that's when
[1:15:42] you create extort coming he's one short
[1:15:48] I don't know if you'll know it but you
[1:15:55] know the message can't be right
[1:15:57] it was one short that proves that Elijah
[1:16:00] was wrong and now a lot is wrong he's
[1:16:03] one short yeah remember it wasn't a man
[1:16:12] that made the promise william branham
[1:16:17] didn't make the promise God made you the
[1:16:20] promise
[1:16:24] they're one of the lodges that made the
[1:16:27] promise that made the promise hell I
[1:16:30] should knew the God that did all the
[1:16:33] other miracles is in charge of that last
[1:16:35] one so he realizes that death angel has
[1:16:40] taken a grip and he remembers the
[1:16:45] promise here a few years ago we were
[1:16:52] here and sister Mariah was in a prayer
[1:16:57] line the same night but Aaron Oglesby a
[1:17:01] miracle happens in his life we had a
[1:17:05] vision of my daughter who could not have
[1:17:08] children you know you start speaking
[1:17:14] about a vision and then the devil starts
[1:17:18] whispering you start speaking about what
[1:17:26] God says and then the devil starts
[1:17:28] whispering I might as well kill some
[1:17:31] devils while I'm preaching
[1:17:40] and so on that's where we're going the
[1:17:45] sense a child she couldn't have a child
[1:17:50] she was born with the defect in her womb
[1:17:53] she couldn't have children but I'm not
[1:17:56] the one that said then my son-in-law is
[1:18:01] an accident
[1:18:03] and it crashes his pelvis and crushes
[1:18:05] his backbone and crushes his shoulder
[1:18:07] you've heard this over and over again I
[1:18:09] touch the other not brother Tim fruit
[1:18:12] even comes and prays with him at the
[1:18:14] hospital but the state you can testify
[1:18:19] this if you're really wanting to die
[1:18:22] don't invite brother Tim to come pray
[1:18:25] for you
[1:18:28] [Applause]
[1:18:43] do you think that the devil didn't
[1:18:45] whisper in my ear do you say God said
