[42:01] Oh yes.

[42:18] Oh, how you shout

[42:25] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[42:28] Amen. Let's sing that one more time. Oh,
[42:32] when we
[42:35] are gathering in.
[42:38] Oh, wash my soul
[42:41] and free from all sin.
[42:44] Oh, how shall I
[42:47] and how
[42:51] when the redeemed
[42:54] are gathering?
[42:58] [Music]
[42:59] Hallelujah. How many is looking forward
[43:01] to that? Amen. That's more than just a
[43:04] story, but it's thus sayeth the Lord.
[43:08] Amen. Let's turn our Bibles to First
[43:10] John, if you would, chapter 4.
[43:14] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[43:16] the Lord and come to worship him and to
[43:19] hear from him.
[43:21] Our God is a good God.
[43:23] Amen. Let's just bow our hearts in
[43:26] prayer go to the author before we read
[43:28] the word. Father, we just come to you,
[43:31] Lord, today once again. Just asking that
[43:33] you'd come and and speak to our hearts,
[43:36] Lord, and minister to us, Lord. That you
[43:38] would just come and touch our lives,
[43:40] Lord, by your presence. The service,
[43:43] Lord, by your presence, Lord, each
[43:44] person gathered here, may they be
[43:46] touched by your presence. We pray. Lord,
[43:49] we commit this service to you. All that
[43:51] be said and done for your glory in Jesus
[43:54] name. Amen.
[43:56] Excuse
[43:58] me. John chapter 1 or chapter 4 and
[44:01] verse one. Beloved, believe not every
[44:04] spirit, but try the spirits whether they
[44:07] are of God, because many false prophets
[44:10] are gone in out into the world. Hereby
[44:13] know ye the spirit of God. Every spirit
[44:16] that confesses that Jesus Christ has
[44:19] come in the flesh is of God. And every
[44:21] spirit that confesses not that Jesus
[44:24] Christ has come in the flesh is not of
[44:26] God. And this is that spirit of
[44:28] antichrist whereof you've heard that it
[44:30] should come and even now already is is
[44:34] it in the world. Ye of God, little
[44:37] children, and have overcame them.
[44:40] Because greater is he that is in you
[44:43] than he that is in the world. Amen. God
[44:46] bless you and be seated.
[44:51] like to speak to you on faith over
[44:53] complexes.
[44:56] Um just looking at this first part of
[44:59] this scripture on beloved believe not
[45:02] every spirit but try the spirits whether
[45:06] they are of God because we know that
[45:09] every spirit is not of God. Amen.
[45:12] There's evil spirits that are working in
[45:14] this world and very prevalent in the
[45:16] world that we live in. And and we know
[45:18] how spirits are. They evil spirits they
[45:21] come and they try to attach themselves
[45:23] to weaknesses in our flesh. Just like
[45:26] you know cancer that's how it starts. It
[45:28] finds a weak cell and and it enters into
[45:30] that weak cell and begins to grow from
[45:32] there. And so spirits come and they try
[45:35] to attach themselves to weak places in
[45:38] our in our lives and whether it be in
[45:40] our human spirit or or wherever that
[45:42] that's where they try to come there. You
[45:44] know, a good adversary is not going to
[45:46] come and try to attack you at your
[45:48] strongest position, but it's going to
[45:50] try to find the weaknesses and the
[45:52] places there that no doubt some have
[45:54] been passed down through generations.
[45:56] And just looking at this thought on
[45:58] complexes or this word on complexes, it
[46:01] says they're caused by a combination of
[46:03] factors including childhood experiences
[46:06] such as upbringing or abuse or neglect
[46:09] or environmental factors like social
[46:12] status or or physical and even mental
[46:15] limitations. says these early experience
[46:18] create deepseated beliefs often
[46:20] unconscious unconscious of that
[46:23] influence thoughts and behavior and
[46:26] sometimes as a defense mechanism against
[46:28] feelings of shame, fear or inferiority.
[46:32] But you know as I said there's many
[46:34] times that even childhood experiences
[46:36] and we'll we'll go into the word on this
[46:38] and quotes on this childhood experiences
[46:41] you know negative experiences in your
[46:43] childhood such as neglect or or or abuse
[46:46] or or or constant unfavorable comparison
[46:49] to others or you know can lead to
[46:51] feelings of being inferior or having a
[46:54] low self-esteem and it causes a complex
[46:57] to come in your life. Amen. other things
[47:00] are around living in certain
[47:01] environments, certain homes, certain
[47:03] things that happened in your childhood
[47:06] and causes you to have disadvantages,
[47:08] you know, maybe being treated poorly by
[47:10] your parents or or your peers or and it
[47:12] begins to develop a complex inside of
[47:15] you and and you know, whether they be
[47:17] real or they be perceived physical
[47:21] or or mental things, they begin to limit
[47:23] you and what you're really called to do.
[47:26] And then we know what our real true
[47:28] calling is not to be just a good human
[47:30] or to be a good person or to be, you
[47:32] know, to live a good life here upon this
[47:34] earth, but our true calling in this life
[47:36] as as a believer is to be a Christian to
[47:39] to live for him. And I believe that's
[47:41] what our life should be about. And you
[47:43] know, that's exactly why the devil is
[47:46] constantly trying to limit us in our
[47:48] abilities to live for him. Amen. Amen.
[47:51] to cause us to pull back, to cause us to
[47:54] bring ourselves in and hide behind a
[47:56] certain thing or or a certain mechanism
[47:58] in our body that that's been passed down
[48:00] or we've learned through life, through
[48:02] situations. You know, the complexes
[48:05] according to a certain man, complexes
[48:08] are a collection of repressed or
[48:10] forgotten emotions or desires or
[48:13] memories with a strong emotional tone
[48:16] that influence behavior without
[48:18] conscious. Amen. It influences you even
[48:21] when you're not even thinking about it.
[48:23] Or maybe that thought of what happened
[48:25] is not even there. But it has constantly
[48:28] influenced your life and it causes you
[48:30] to have an emotional impact. And
[48:32] complexes often arise from intense
[48:35] emotions like shame and fear and trauma.
[48:38] And it creates a pattern of thoughts.
[48:40] And those pattern of thoughts become a
[48:42] pattern of behavior. And that pattern of
[48:45] behavior becomes your life and how you
[48:47] look at things and how you how you view
[48:50] things, you know. And then that's very
[48:51] important that we we realize how are we
[48:54] really viewing things. It ain't my view
[48:56] or brother Aaron's view or brother Tim's
[48:58] view or anybody else's view. We should
[49:00] be looking as Jesus Christ would look at
[49:03] things. How he would view things and how
[49:06] he would look at things. So we see that
[49:08] these experiences and feelings can
[49:11] consolidate consolidate into a core form
[49:14] of thought and behavior and that
[49:16] influence will come and bring you into a
[49:19] place and how you will interact or how
[49:22] you will be or how your social life will
[49:24] be. We see it happening. Now, I want you
[49:26] to understand, you do not get a complex
[49:29] by the word from the word of God. You do
[49:31] not get a complex by the blood of Jesus
[49:34] Christ. You'll receive love. Love. Amen.
[49:37] You get love. Not a complex, you know,
[49:39] not that I'm a little bigger, somebody
[49:40] else, or a little better, or I know a
[49:43] little more. No, I just got I I want
[49:46] Jesus Christ in my life leading me and
[49:49] guiding me. Amen. That's exactly what
[49:51] the word of God is for. It's to lead us
[49:53] and it's to guide. And that's why the
[49:55] devil is constantly against us. That's
[49:58] why I think it's a kind of a paradox
[50:00] that he would come and set up things
[50:02] even today, you know, for real funny
[50:04] things like grabbing the wrong
[50:05] microphone or getting the wrong key.
[50:07] What would happen if you would have a
[50:08] complex from that? It would begin to to
[50:11] uh operate in the and and and change the
[50:14] whole the whole service. Amen. Because
[50:17] if you would operate, well, I made a
[50:19] mistake or I did this wrong or I made
[50:21] this D and then before you know it, I
[50:23] might as well just quit. I I ain't got
[50:25] no reason for being here. I might as
[50:27] well just give up singing. I I might as
[50:29] well just give up preaching because I I
[50:31] grabbed the wrong microphone. But
[50:32] listen, God, that's how Satan wants to
[50:34] come and operate in that. But I'm not
[50:37] looking in those eyes. I'm not looking
[50:39] at my failures. I'm looking at a calling
[50:42] God has placed in my life that
[50:45] regardless if I grab the right
[50:46] microphone or the wrong microphone, it
[50:49] changes nothing.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Regardless if we get the right key or
[50:54] the wrong key, it changes nothing. It's
[50:56] about worshiping God. It's about living
[50:59] for him.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; But see, people live under these things
[51:04] and and it's been passed down through
[51:07] situations or life. You know, brother
[51:09] Brandham talks about he's asked a
[51:10] question. He said, "When a person
[51:12] realizes he has an inferior complex or
[51:15] some sort of complex, how can he
[51:18] overcome this? Should it be if he was
[51:20] only child caused this from his early
[51:23] youth?" So then maybe that's what they
[51:24] had. You know, maybe they was the only
[51:26] child and they're trying to figure out
[51:27] is this why I got this complex. But he
[51:30] said, here's his word. Take exactly the
[51:33] opposite.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Try the spirits. Amen. Take exactly the
[51:39] opposite. If you're always wanting your
[51:41] way and you're that little brat that
[51:43] wants to always have everything your
[51:44] way, turn right back around and give
[51:46] everything you got the other way.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. If you're selfish and
[51:52] you want to hold everything, then start
[51:54] giving away what you got. Do whatever.
[51:57] Just go the vice versa. That's the way
[51:59] to overcome anything is the antidote.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen. That's exactly if
[52:06] you're if you're stubborn, go the other
[52:08] way.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; If you're inferior, Amen. move the other
[52:12] way.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Don't go too far the other way or you'll
[52:15] come superior.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; There is a middle of the road.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; That's where we want to be. That's what
[52:23] the word of God is. Amen. And so he
[52:25] says, you know, another person asked
[52:26] this question about speaking of
[52:28] stubborn. He said, "Brother Brandham,
[52:29] I'm saved and I've been baptized in the
[52:31] name of Jesus Christ, but how do I get
[52:33] away from a stubborn spirit that I can't
[52:36] seem to break away from?" He said,
[52:38] "Well, my Christian brother or sister,
[52:40] whoever it may be, many times you find
[52:42] people that's got stubborn spirits. It's
[52:45] usually a complex that's caused this.
[52:47] Either they have inherited from a
[52:49] mother, father, uncle, aunt,
[52:50] grandmother, grandfather, somebody like
[52:52] that. And if you trace it back down
[52:54] through their life, you'll find he said,
[52:56] "I've taken this by experience under
[52:58] discernment because I met cases on the
[53:00] platform, thousands of those that had
[53:02] that spirit, the first thing you know, I
[53:04] trace that spirit back by discernment
[53:06] and find that there was a granddaddy or
[53:08] a grandmother or somebody back there
[53:10] that you inherited by nature."
[53:13] Stubbornness is not of God. Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Be like, "Brother Joe do Joe." Brother
[53:20] Joe, I started ducking here.
[53:23] Stubbornness is not of God. Now, the
[53:26] only way you can get away from that is
[53:28] you have to have faith to overcome that.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are a Christian. You're a son
[53:33] or daughter of God, whoever you may be.
[53:35] You'll never be able to just stand and
[53:37] rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke it.
[53:39] That's just like tantalizing a
[53:40] rattlesnake. He's laying there ready to
[53:42] bite you. If you'll just ignore him and
[53:44] walk away, he can't hurt you. But when
[53:48] you feel that you got that stubb
[53:49] stubborn spirit, lay that thing on the
[53:52] altar and believe that believe God that
[53:55] the thing is dead and you'll never have
[53:57] it no more and go on and don't pay no
[54:00] more attention to it. The thing will
[54:02] leave you. Resist the devil and he will
[54:04] flee from you. You'll get away quickly.
[54:06] That would be my advice. How to overcome
[54:09] it. We overcome the devil by faith.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Not just rebuke it, rebuke it, rebuke it
[54:18] by faith. Walk in the word of God.
[54:22] That's not who I am. It was handed down
[54:24] maybe through generational curses.
[54:26] Whatever it is, you can put whatever you
[54:28] want to. It may not be stubbornness you
[54:30] deal with tonight. It might be pride. It
[54:32] might be arrogance. Amen. Complexes that
[54:34] are laid there. It might be a
[54:36] superiority complex that you're greater
[54:38] than everybody. It might be in for you.
[54:40] Whatever it is, we are not to walk
[54:43] according to those spirits, but
[54:45] according to the word of God.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; And the only way you overcome it is by
[54:50] faith. You lay it down and you walk away
[54:52] from it. And sure, it's going to try to
[54:54] rise up, but you just keep walking.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he said even, you know, even
[55:02] I'm thankful that the message that we
[55:04] have, Amen. the the word of God that we
[55:07] have now, if you don't understand what
[55:09] we're talking about, we believe that God
[55:10] sent a prophet in this day and and and
[55:12] you can see it in the scriptures. If
[55:14] you'd like to talk about it, we'd love
[55:15] to talk with you about it. But Amen. I
[55:17] believe I'm I'm so thankful that our
[55:19] prophet was open enough to tell us about
[55:21] his own humanities,
[55:23] &gt;&gt; that he also dealt with complexes. you
[55:26] know, he he got a complex because he got
[55:28] to a place that he felt like nobody
[55:30] wanted to hear him preach anymore
[55:32] &gt;&gt; because it went from the great meetings
[55:34] of divine healing and and thousands
[55:37] would come and cuz you know they really
[55:39] wasn't really he was only part of it.
[55:41] They wanted to see the can I say it this
[55:42] way in the magic show.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That people could get out of
[55:46] wheelchairs and and people would get get
[55:49] you know be lame would walk and all
[55:51] those things that had happened. And when
[55:52] that started to go and he started to
[55:54] move towards that third pull and that
[55:56] third phase of his ministry and started
[55:58] to preach the word and start I mean not
[56:00] in all way but you know what I'm saying
[56:01] the truths of the word and the word came
[56:04] open and he began to stand there. Amen.
[56:06] Friends walked away and people that had
[56:08] been with him walked away and this one
[56:09] trying to tell him why you preaching
[56:11] this why you keep preaching about women
[56:13] and their makeup and their hair and all.
[56:14] Why you keep doing all that? If you just
[56:16] preach the healing that would bring the
[56:18] crowds.
[56:21] And he developed a complex because now
[56:24] his meetings were getting smaller and
[56:26] the pressure was greater and things were
[56:28] happening and it caused him to want to
[56:30] go completely off the field. Caused him
[56:33] to want to go into a place of hiding.
[56:35] Amen. He said, "I'll just be like one of
[56:36] the Old Testament prophets. I'll go up
[56:38] into the mountains and I'll grow a beard
[56:40] out and when the word of the Lord comes
[56:42] to me, I'll come down and I'll say, thus
[56:44] sayaith the Lord and I'll go back up
[56:45] into the mountains again." But that
[56:47] wasn't what God intended for him to be.
[56:50] God had called him for a different
[56:52] platform and a different way. Amen. And
[56:54] so he we know the story. He goes there
[56:57] with his boy his boy Billy and they're
[56:59] going up into the wilderness and they
[57:00] stop and he's had these thoughts in his
[57:03] minds and these plans. He's done planned
[57:04] it all out. This complex has gotten so
[57:07] big he's already moved into the
[57:09] wilderness in his mind. He said, "I'll
[57:11] just trick my wife and I I I'll just
[57:13] take her up there and she won't even
[57:14] know." And he's got all of these plans
[57:16] out of a complex.
[57:18] That's right.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; And he's sitting there and getting a
[57:23] little breakfast at that little diner
[57:24] that morning and this big old mountain
[57:27] man is sitting over there and he let out
[57:29] one of them mountain man sneezes. My
[57:32] kind of sneeze.
[57:34] Sorry, but I don't understand anybody. I
[57:36] I don't understand that.
[57:39] It don't work for me. I'm sorry. I
[57:40] something handed down from my papa. I
[57:42] guess my papa butts. you. He was over in
[57:44] the next house and he you knew when he
[57:46] sneezed, you can be in your house in bed
[57:47] and you can still hear him. This man let
[57:50] out a big old sneeze.
[57:53] He's like, "Ah, that's a real man."
[57:56] About that time, these two other little
[57:57] fellas come walking in, little bummed
[57:59] looking guys walking in off the street
[58:01] there and his boy looks over there and
[58:03] says, "Daddy, that looks like you." It
[58:05] was Uncle Fletcher. Uncle Fletcher. He
[58:08] said, "That looks just like you and
[58:09] Fletcher, boy.
[58:13] He said he just looked at that and he
[58:15] thought, "Wow." And he got back and they
[58:17] got back in the car and said, "Let's
[58:18] go." And he got back in the car and the
[58:19] word of the Lord came and the word voice
[58:21] of God spoke and said, "If you'll carry
[58:22] out your plans, you're going to be just
[58:24] like them,
[58:26] &gt;&gt; a bomb." This is where his complex was
[58:29] leading him to. This is where his
[58:31] complex was driving him to to be a bomb.
[58:36] That's why we got to try the spirits
[58:38] that try to rise up in our lives and
[58:40] realize, are we being led by the spirit
[58:42] of God? Or is it some other spirit
[58:44] that's trying to rise up and cause me to
[58:46] not be who I'm supposed to be? Cause me
[58:49] to be just a spiritual bomb that I have
[58:51] no rights. I I have nothing. I have no
[58:54] no I have no inheritance. I have
[58:57] nothing.
[59:02] He gets up to his church and he begins
[59:05] to talk about it. He says, "Pray that
[59:07] God will place into my hearts that
[59:09] something that I lost there in that
[59:12] complex." It's so easy to build a
[59:15] complex.
[59:18] He said, "I had an interview the other
[59:19] day with brother Wayey sitting here
[59:21] sitting here present a good man but
[59:23] built himself around the complex another
[59:26] kind of complex did the same thing.
[59:28] Brother way, you can so easily do it.
[59:30] You just get a little some little,
[59:32] listen to this. You could just get a
[59:33] little something in your mind and you
[59:35] keep thinking that way.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; But then he says, go back and check it
[59:42] with the scriptures and see if it's
[59:44] really right or really wrong.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Search the scriptures. Try the spirits.
[59:51] Amen. See, yeah. You know, don't he
[59:53] said, don't lose the feeling of the
[59:54] people. You must remember they're not
[59:56] made out of sawdust. They're flesh and
[59:59] blood. Human beings with a soul. Pray
[1:00:01] for me all of you if you will. And it
[1:00:04] goes on the ne that night. Amen. Now, we
[1:00:06] know what happened at the end of that
[1:00:07] service. Brother Weey would fall over
[1:00:09] dead with a heart attack and God would
[1:00:11] raise him up. It is the proof that
[1:00:13] brother Tim's a witness to the very his
[1:00:15] wife telling the very details and all
[1:00:17] these things. Hey, listen. This he said
[1:00:19] then that evening he said this morning
[1:00:20] when making my confession of having a
[1:00:23] complex I referred to brother we as also
[1:00:25] having a complex which is certainly
[1:00:27] normal among all people
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; among all people he said but so a little
[1:00:33] further down he said so I say that in
[1:00:34] honor of Jesus Christ who is the same
[1:00:36] God when this morning I'd preached at
[1:00:38] length way over my time tired worn and
[1:00:40] there and he said he he he either got
[1:00:42] tired or when I spoke he talking about
[1:00:44] brother way now he either got tired or
[1:00:46] when I spoke of having a complex Not
[1:00:48] just to mess my brother up, as we'd say.
[1:00:50] I was making my confession of having a
[1:00:53] complex. And I guess if I He said, I
[1:00:55] guess I'll ask this audience of people,
[1:00:57] how many here knows you have a complex.
[1:01:00] Practically every hand would go up that
[1:01:01] you might know, Brother Way, just let
[1:01:03] let me show you whether it's discernment
[1:01:05] or not. How many knows that you got the
[1:01:07] a complex? Raise your hands. Look at
[1:01:09] here. See, but I don't know if that
[1:01:11] shock of me saying that to brother way,
[1:01:13] talking it, talking it like that and
[1:01:15] saying it that he thought I might rebuke
[1:01:17] him or something. But then when he heard
[1:01:19] that, he fell into this condition. But
[1:01:22] praise God, he brought him back.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; So here here one is confessing his pro
[1:01:28] his problem. Another one is res. Brother
[1:01:30] Brandon would say in a different place.
[1:01:31] He resented what I said.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; And he fell over from a complex.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Listen, we don't understand how deep
[1:01:42] these things sometimes can go into our
[1:01:44] life and how effective they can be.
[1:01:46] Amen. You know, it's another story here.
[1:01:48] Brother Brandham talks about a boy. He
[1:01:50] said, "I was called in on a scene. A
[1:01:52] little something going on. It was a fine
[1:01:54] young man. Very fine young man was going
[1:01:56] with this little girl. Fine little girl
[1:01:57] out of fine family. A lot of fine
[1:01:59] people, right? Sound like Christian
[1:02:01] people. And this boy all of a sudden
[1:02:03] came up with some kind of idea and he
[1:02:05] just walked away. Did something wrong to
[1:02:06] the little girl much as promised her to
[1:02:08] do certain things, then didn't do it
[1:02:10] instead ofizing like a gentleman should
[1:02:12] do. It just wasn't in him to do it. And
[1:02:14] the father and mother called on the
[1:02:16] scene and said, "We would desire to know
[1:02:17] what's wrong with our boy." He said,
[1:02:19] "It's not easy to do sometimes, but you
[1:02:21] must be truthful and honest." The boy
[1:02:23] was a Christian as far as a believer. He
[1:02:26] had repented, been baptized, had his
[1:02:28] position among the believers, but had
[1:02:30] not received the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:32] Spirit. No matter how much he thought he
[1:02:36] had,
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; we heard about that Sunday, right?
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; You thinking you have it and having it
[1:02:41] is two different things.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; You might be able to try to say you
[1:02:45] have, you might be able to show some
[1:02:46] evidence of some emotion, but unless you
[1:02:48] your life is vindicating what you're
[1:02:50] professing to have, you don't have it.
[1:02:55] No matter how many emotions, how much
[1:02:56] jump, run, sensation, speaking in tongu,
[1:02:58] shouting, whatever you lay upon, that's
[1:03:00] all right. I believe in all that, too.
[1:03:02] But unless your life copes with your
[1:03:04] testimony, then you don't have it
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; because the fruit of the spirit
[1:03:08] vindicates what you are. Just like the
[1:03:10] fruit of any tree tells what it is. By
[1:03:12] their fruits, you shall know them, Jesus
[1:03:13] said. But anyway, his mother is a
[1:03:15] German. No reflections on the German,
[1:03:17] but there's a strain in that family.
[1:03:18] They'll sit and you can talk to them and
[1:03:20] they'll just stare you right in the
[1:03:22] face. They got it. this girl's sister,
[1:03:24] mother of this boy, her sister. I come
[1:03:26] down the streets many morning. Young
[1:03:27] lady be sitting in the yard. I say,
[1:03:29] "Good morning to you." And she just look
[1:03:30] at me. I'll stop and I'll say, "Just
[1:03:32] fine morning, right?" She'll just stand
[1:03:33] and look at me. Just intelligent woman.
[1:03:35] I said, "Come on, come up see us
[1:03:37] sometime." She just stand and look. Her
[1:03:39] brothers are the same way. Father and
[1:03:40] mother that way.
[1:03:43] No reflections on the Germans
[1:03:47] because I'm gonna get on some other
[1:03:48] people too in just a minute. All right.
[1:03:50] Give me just a m. But let me tell you,
[1:03:51] there's a lot of Germans in church.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; You can say, "God is good." And they'll
[1:03:57] just look at you.
[1:03:59] You can say, "Amen. Jesus Christ is the
[1:04:01] same yesterday, today, and forever."
[1:04:02] They just look at you.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; You can say all kinds of that. What is
[1:04:06] it? It's a stray that's been passed
[1:04:08] down. It's a devil trying to rob them of
[1:04:10] their blessing.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Come on now. And here here he said, "Now
[1:04:16] the boy is strictly an Irishman.
[1:04:20] Oh boy. Moody and hightempered and
[1:04:22] highrung.
[1:04:23] His whole family is like that except the
[1:04:26] ones that are converted.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; So that tells me that if you really
[1:04:34] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost as
[1:04:37] we heard Sunday, it'll rewrite your
[1:04:39] life.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; It'll rewrite your nature. It'll rewrite
[1:04:43] everything about you. Amen.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, there might be family strains
[1:04:48] that are in this building that's been
[1:04:49] passed down by generation by generation.
[1:04:52] Listen, let me tell you, going to a
[1:04:54] shrink is not going to help you. Going
[1:04:56] to a psychologist is not going to fix
[1:04:58] it. But if you can get to Jesus,
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; if you can get to that spirit of God and
[1:05:03] it come on the inside of you, it can do
[1:05:06] more for you in just a few seconds.
[1:05:15] The father this father and mother both
[1:05:17] Christians filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:19] They brought this young man up in the
[1:05:21] way of the Lord. But now he's 17, 18
[1:05:23] years old something along there. Very
[1:05:24] fine kid been a model boy at home.
[1:05:28] So mother's family lives close to a fine
[1:05:30] church, but do you think they'd ever
[1:05:31] come over? No. And they know it's right,
[1:05:34] but it's not in them to ask forgiveness
[1:05:36] or ask pardoning. They won't do it. It's
[1:05:38] just not in them. Now the genes of the
[1:05:41] father and this mother is in this boy no
[1:05:43] matter how much they are converted
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; still remains in the flesh of this boy
[1:05:49] that's been bred down through
[1:05:50] generations. Therefore the boy has got a
[1:05:53] complex in him from his mother's family
[1:05:56] and they are not forgiven. They will not
[1:05:58] apologize. And that's where that boy
[1:06:01] stands right now.
[1:06:03] And he said, 'I said to the father, no
[1:06:05] matter how much you've raised him right
[1:06:06] now, look out of your family, all them
[1:06:08] drunks, fighting, shooting, cutting up,
[1:06:10] and so forth. Look at your family there,
[1:06:12] but to your to the mother, they're a
[1:06:13] bunch of people that just sit there and
[1:06:15] won't speak, very independent, so forth,
[1:06:16] irrevant, irreverent to religion. But I
[1:06:19] said, it's not you. You're one of your
[1:06:21] uh you're the only one out of your
[1:06:22] sisters and brothers. You're sweet and
[1:06:23] kind and forgiving. What does that?
[1:06:28] You're on the same tree, the family
[1:06:30] tree. Yet, you have received the Holy
[1:06:33] Ghost. That's right.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; That's the thing you have made you
[1:06:36] tender and sweet. It's not your people
[1:06:39] anymore. It's Christ that lives on you
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; in you. I said the boy, look at your
[1:06:44] family practically the man practically
[1:06:46] all them drunks and so forth. How moody,
[1:06:48] high-tempered, how strong, but you're
[1:06:49] not. You're kind. You're forgiven. What
[1:06:52] is it? You're on the same tree.
[1:06:55] It's You should have the same genes.
[1:06:57] What happened? The Holy Spirit is no
[1:07:00] more who you are or what you are is what
[1:07:02] Christ is in you. Now the same thing has
[1:07:06] to happen to your son.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; The same thing has to happen to your
[1:07:12] son. What has to happen? The Holy Ghost
[1:07:15] has to happen.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; It cannot be passed down generation to
[1:07:20] generation. This is what people get
[1:07:22] wrong. We think sometime we can just
[1:07:24] pass down an intellectual understanding
[1:07:26] and if they believe what we believe,
[1:07:28] they're going to be all right. No, I
[1:07:29] tell you how they're going to be all
[1:07:30] right. If they get what Peter got. If
[1:07:33] they get what Paul got. If they get the
[1:07:35] same Holy Ghost.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Father raised up and said, "Well, my son
[1:07:44] went to the altar. He was baptized in
[1:07:48] the name of Jesus Christ. Water baptism
[1:07:50] in the pool. I know my son has come to
[1:07:52] Christ. Said that's all right. That's
[1:07:54] good. All the outward motions, he might
[1:07:57] be identified as a believer with
[1:07:59] believers, but until he's regenerated,
[1:08:02] born again.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Somebody say born again.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Born again. I advise that young man to
[1:08:09] never marry a woman.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; He'll make hell on earth for her until
[1:08:14] that gentle, sweet, forgiving spirit of
[1:08:16] Christ comes in. Then that will be a
[1:08:18] paradox in itself. And it'll take the
[1:08:20] very nature of a boy that's been bred
[1:08:23] between father and mother. Yet in his
[1:08:25] intellectual, he's trying his best to
[1:08:27] overcome it. He'll never do it. He'll
[1:08:29] never overcome it. Christ will have to
[1:08:31] overcome it. When he lets Christ in,
[1:08:33] then he's already overcame.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Then greater is he that's in you than he
[1:08:40] that's in the world.
[1:08:43] He said, "I've seen critics stand off
[1:08:44] and make fun and carry on about a Holy
[1:08:47] Ghost revival, and after a while, God
[1:08:48] will get a hold of that same man and
[1:08:50] change him. And here he stands right in
[1:08:52] the pull pit preaching the same thing
[1:08:54] that he once hated."
[1:08:57] Did you catch that?
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Did you really catch that?
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "After a while, God get a hold
[1:09:03] of that same man and change him." And
[1:09:04] here he stands right in the pullpit
[1:09:07] preaching the same thing that he once
[1:09:09] hated.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:12] What did it?
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; But you know he says here
[1:09:22] said you know he said after all these
[1:09:24] years in the field and around the world
[1:09:26] getting the people I ought to know a
[1:09:28] little bit about the gate to enter in
[1:09:30] at. If you want to get somewhere with
[1:09:33] God never let an arrogant spirit ever
[1:09:36] come around.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Don't let no malice come. No matter what
[1:09:41] anybody says, if they're all wrong,
[1:09:43] don't you ever build up a complex
[1:09:45] against that person
[1:09:48] cuz people don't understand sometimes
[1:09:49] they can get feelings towards a certain
[1:09:51] person in the church. And if they're not
[1:09:53] they're not they're not they need to be
[1:09:55] real careful because some that that
[1:09:57] feeling can actually not be really
[1:09:59] towards that person. It can be between
[1:10:01] before that God
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; or aimed at God. You get what I'm
[1:10:04] saying? Because listen, we got to look
[1:10:05] beyond the human veils.
[1:10:08] That's right.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; People get complexes built up towards
[1:10:13] people in the church and they get angry
[1:10:15] and they won't worship God. Listen, that
[1:10:16] is not a That is not a complex towards
[1:10:19] somebody. That's a complex towards God.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Don't ever let that thing be sweet and
[1:10:28] kind. Remember, God loved you when you
[1:10:32] were in sin.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:38] Hallelujah. God loved you when you were
[1:10:41] unlovable.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; God loved you when you made mistakes.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; God may loved you when you wasn't
[1:10:47] perfect.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; God loves you even though you're still
[1:10:50] not perfect.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; And if the spirit of God's in you,
[1:10:57] you'll love the other person when he's
[1:10:59] been wrong. Just pray for him and love
[1:11:01] one another above everything. Love God.
[1:11:02] Love one another. be humble with God and
[1:11:05] around one another and then God will
[1:11:07] bless you. It's hard telling what he
[1:11:09] will do.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:13] But people get things happen in their
[1:11:15] life as we've talked about. You know,
[1:11:16] Brother Brandley, this is interesting as
[1:11:18] an accident at work. This man was going
[1:11:20] through and says, "You've had a this is
[1:11:22] in discernment. You had an accident.
[1:11:24] It's a you were gassed with carbon
[1:11:25] monoxide gas. Is that true? It poisoned
[1:11:28] you. It poisoned you in your liver and
[1:11:30] you had trouble with that. You had
[1:11:31] trouble with your stomach and you had
[1:11:32] trouble with your heart and has made you
[1:11:34] so nervous until you built up a complex.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; But now you're forced that you have to
[1:11:40] go back to work and you're afraid to do
[1:11:42] that. You're afraid of that carbon
[1:11:44] monoxide gas.
[1:11:47] But it's going to be all right. Jesus
[1:11:50] Christ you remember if Jesus Christ
[1:11:52] would tell me who you are. Now you know
[1:11:54] those things are true, wouldn't they? If
[1:11:55] he'll tell me who you are, will you
[1:11:57] accept it and know and go on back and be
[1:11:58] of good cheer, will you? All right, Mr.
[1:12:00] Wagner, go on back your road. It's okay.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But what was it? It was
[1:12:06] something that happened and it scarred
[1:12:08] him. And in that scar, that's where the
[1:12:10] devil wants to come and attack
[1:12:12] something.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; That's where he wants to attach things
[1:12:14] in your life through scars. You may have
[1:12:17] had scars handed down through from your
[1:12:19] from your situations in your marriage or
[1:12:21] or or situations when you was a child,
[1:12:24] whatever. Listen, that's where the devil
[1:12:26] wants to come and attach his feelings
[1:12:28] and attach his fears and to attach his
[1:12:31] situation. There's only one cure for
[1:12:33] that.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; There ain't no medicine that you will
[1:12:36] ever go down to Walmart that'll ever
[1:12:38] cure you of that. There's no doctor
[1:12:40] you'll ever go to that'll ever cure you
[1:12:42] of that. There's only one cure. That's
[1:12:44] the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; That's the life of Christ to come on the
[1:12:48] inside and to put his bomb over the
[1:12:51] wound and the scars of your life.
[1:12:57] So you always get scared. Lots of things
[1:13:00] frighten you now. Dog or something like
[1:13:03] that. You'll make a noise. You'll
[1:13:04] scream. One time coming from school, you
[1:13:06] was run by one, wasn't? Yeah. Yep. And
[1:13:09] that makes you real nervous and you
[1:13:11] always feel that when you're upset
[1:13:15] and you're always deep thinking and
[1:13:16] crosses bridges before you get there.
[1:13:20] What happened from a scare?
[1:13:24] It changed the trajectory of her mind to
[1:13:27] where now she can't even she's her mind
[1:13:29] is so changed that she could start
[1:13:33] taking on problems. She started crossing
[1:13:35] bridges and always deep thinking. Why?
[1:13:38] Because of a complex.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Another one say I see you I see it go
[1:13:45] way back to a little girl. I see you a
[1:13:47] little girl. You're running from
[1:13:48] something. It was something chasing you.
[1:13:50] It was a dog. It seemed like you was
[1:13:52] coming from school or something. What?
[1:13:53] It scared you and since then you've been
[1:13:55] nervous like all your life.
[1:13:58] What is it? It's caused from something
[1:14:00] in their life that they've allowed to
[1:14:02] lay there and they've allowed to to
[1:14:05] fester and you know complex. You know
[1:14:06] people use complexes many times to hide
[1:14:09] behind them.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; They hide behind them to hide you know
[1:14:13] to hide behind something usually you
[1:14:15] pick out something that's bigger than
[1:14:16] you
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:20] You know, kids, little kids, they they
[1:14:22] don't have that concept, right? I mean,
[1:14:23] they'll go hide behind this little
[1:14:25] little post right here and, you know,
[1:14:28] and they think they're hiding.
[1:14:30] I remember dad coming to try to find me
[1:14:32] one day in the woods, and I was hiding
[1:14:33] behind this tree, but it wasn't quite
[1:14:35] big enough.
[1:14:39] You always want to find something that's
[1:14:40] bigger than you, right?
[1:14:42] So, you want to hide behind a tree or
[1:14:44] you want to find something big enough
[1:14:46] that no one can see you that you're
[1:14:48] behind it. That no one can see really
[1:14:50] who you are. And if you're sticking out
[1:14:52] somewhere, it don't work. So, people
[1:14:54] make their problems or their complexes
[1:14:57] bigger so they can hide behind them. So,
[1:14:59] their real self or their real feelings
[1:15:02] are never in view.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; But we're not to be hid behind a
[1:15:08] complex. We are to be hid behind the
[1:15:10] word of God.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; That is a true hiding place. That's the
[1:15:15] only place you can find true safety. It
[1:15:18] will not be in your complex.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; It will not be in your fear. It will not
[1:15:24] be you pulling back and coming, you
[1:15:26] know, moving. It won't you'll never find
[1:15:28] true hiding there. The only place you
[1:15:30] can truly hide is in under the wings of
[1:15:33] Jehovah. The only true place you can
[1:15:35] hide is under the word of God.
[1:15:38] Amen.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; So in reality, what you're saying is
[1:15:42] your complexes is bigger than the word
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; cuz it's it's a big it can hide you
[1:15:48] better. You know, just like Gideon,
[1:15:52] he was hiding behind something. He was
[1:15:55] feeling inferior to the enemy.
[1:15:58] He was feeling that he wasn't big enough
[1:16:00] and he wasn't great enough to fight
[1:16:02] them. And it wasn't possible that he
[1:16:04] could do this. And it wasn't possible.
[1:16:06] He surely if somebody God was going to
[1:16:07] use somebody in this day, it wasn't
[1:16:09] going to be him. It was going to be
[1:16:10] somebody else. So he's hiding behind a
[1:16:12] wine wine press threshing some wheat
[1:16:14] because why? He had a complex. He was
[1:16:17] hiding back there in feeling inferior to
[1:16:20] the calling that need the work that
[1:16:22] needed to be done. And then you know
[1:16:24] when God I love this when God come the
[1:16:26] angel come and spoke to him, he didn't
[1:16:28] call him and you inferior nothing. You
[1:16:30] he what you doing back here hiding? Get
[1:16:32] out there. No, he said, "Get in, thou
[1:16:34] mighty man of valor."
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; I love when God addresses his people. He
[1:16:41] does not address them the way they feel.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad about that tonight? He
[1:16:46] does not look at you tonight and address
[1:16:48] you the way you feel. Well, you sorry,
[1:16:50] low down, rich. You unworthy, no good
[1:16:53] for nothing. No, Gideon, thou mighty man
[1:16:56] of valor.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was another man that was
[1:17:01] short in statue. He had a complex,
[1:17:04] Zakius. And what was he doing? He was
[1:17:06] hiding in behind the leaves of a tree.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Not realizing Jesus saw him and loved
[1:17:15] him no matter who he was, what he was,
[1:17:20] what size he was.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; What he looked like.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Well, I just wish I was prettier. God
[1:17:27] made you this way. Amen.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Well, I just wish I had better looks.
[1:17:33] God made you this way.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; I just wish I was a little taller. God
[1:17:36] made you that way.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Is he a good artist or is he not a good
[1:17:44] artist?
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Is he a good sculptor or is he not a
[1:17:47] good sculptor? Can he make masterpieces
[1:17:49] or can he not make masterpieces? Amen.
[1:17:52] This is what he was. And but notice he
[1:17:54] couldn't hide from Jesus. No matter how
[1:17:57] small he was or how big the tree was.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, you're not Jesus
[1:18:03] wants to come to you. Yeah. I don't care
[1:18:05] how big you built your complex. I don't
[1:18:07] how I don't care how big that you're
[1:18:09] hiding behind what you're hiding behind.
[1:18:11] If Jesus wants to come to you, he knows
[1:18:13] where you're at and he knows how to call
[1:18:15] your name. And I believe tonight he
[1:18:18] knows where somebody's at. And he knows
[1:18:20] you pulled back and you've been in this
[1:18:22] complex and he's calling you tonight and
[1:18:25] that tree ain't big enough for you to
[1:18:27] hide behind. That complex ain't big
[1:18:29] enough for you to hide behind. That fear
[1:18:31] is not big enough.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Zakius, I'm going to your house.
[1:18:49] Ephesians 2 and verse 10 says, "We are
[1:18:52] his workmanship."
[1:18:57] You know, he took great great,
[1:19:01] what's the word I'm looking for? Pains.
[1:19:04] That's the word. To make sure you got
[1:19:06] here
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; from not just two gener one generation
[1:19:10] ago or two, but from since the beginning
[1:19:12] of time. Amen.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; He watched his lineages cross and
[1:19:17] lineages cross and he protected and he
[1:19:20] kept men in battle. He he he he made
[1:19:22] sure certain things certain genes was
[1:19:25] passing through because he had somebody
[1:19:27] in his mind apparently.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron, his own grandfather was
[1:19:34] on a ship that set the Rick record for
[1:19:36] listing
[1:19:38] in World War II. Got it out. It was a
[1:19:42] typhoon. It got out there and set the
[1:19:44] world world record for listing. Should
[1:19:46] have went down. Should have capsized.
[1:19:47] Should have. But there was a man on
[1:19:49] there
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; because God had in his mind there had to
[1:19:55] be a preacher in in even like
[1:19:56] tabernacle.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; And that ship couldn't go down if it
[1:20:01] wanted to.
[1:20:05] And here sometimes you sit in your
[1:20:07] complexes and your unworthiness and your
[1:20:09] unbelief and all of that stuff that's
[1:20:11] going on not realizing how hard how much
[1:20:14] God worked to get you here for this
[1:20:16] moment
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; to know that I got a bride in Leodysia
[1:20:20] that's without going to be without spot
[1:20:22] without wrinkle without blemish. So I'm
[1:20:24] going to watch over this one. I'm going
[1:20:25] to watch over this one. I'm because I
[1:20:27] got to have her there.
[1:20:33] We are his workmanship, which means a
[1:20:35] work of art.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; You know, I I have went through some
[1:20:43] amazing halls of art. I was there in
[1:20:46] Paris. What's the name of that place,
[1:20:48] Brother Joe? That's got all those art
[1:20:50] pieces. The Lou, thank you. Walk through
[1:20:53] that. Incredible. And some of them I
[1:20:55] wouldn't give you a dime for.
[1:21:01] I like, well,
[1:21:03] that's interesting.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; But it has to be a masterpiece, you
[1:21:07] know? It has to be worth a bunch of
[1:21:08] money to be hung in a place like that.
[1:21:11] But to me, it wasn't worth nothing.
[1:21:15] Hey, listen. I I went I went I went to
[1:21:17] went to where they were standing in line
[1:21:19] to see the Mona Lisa. I didn't stand in
[1:21:21] that line from afar. She was ugly from
[1:21:23] afar. I didn't want to be close to her.
[1:21:28] I was like, "No, I'm good. I see it
[1:21:30] right here."
[1:21:32] Or whatever. I see it.
[1:21:35] I wouldn't give you a dime for it.
[1:21:39] But they works of art they call them.
[1:21:41] People, you know, today can throw stuff
[1:21:43] on a canvas and it looks like they call
[1:21:45] it abstract art or something. It just
[1:21:47] looks like somebody got drunk and crazy
[1:21:49] and did all kind of stupid stuff. It
[1:21:51] does. It don't make no sense. And it
[1:21:52] sells for millions of dollars.
[1:21:56] But he says you are his workmanship.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Now there may be somebody in this earth
[1:22:02] that wouldn't give a dime for you. There
[1:22:04] might be somebody in this earth that
[1:22:05] wouldn't care if you lived or died.
[1:22:07] There might be somebody that wouldn't
[1:22:09] care if you took another breath or not.
[1:22:11] But I can tell you the one who counts,
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; he cared enough that he gave his life
[1:22:16] for you.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; That tells me that you're worth
[1:22:19] something. That tells me, amen, you're
[1:22:22] worth more than those paintings hanging
[1:22:24] in the Lou there that I wouldn't give
[1:22:26] you a dime for. And even if they were
[1:22:28] worth millions of dollars, Amen. They
[1:22:30] ain't a There ain't very many people
[1:22:31] that I know would give their life for
[1:22:33] them.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Come on. Ain't very many people I know
[1:22:37] it's I want that one. Kill me.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; No. No. But God said, I want that one,
[1:22:43] and I want that one, that one, that one,
[1:22:45] that one, that one. They are my works of
[1:22:47] art.
[1:22:50] He thought I was worth saving.
[1:22:53] He thought I was worth keeping. He
[1:22:55] thought I was worth dying for. And he
[1:22:58] called me by name.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; I had to break that complex.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I don't have the whole lot of
[1:23:10] time, but I I I love this scripture.
[1:23:12] I've read it before, but I I want to get
[1:23:14] down to a verse, but Psalms 139. Just go
[1:23:17] home and dwell on that for a little bit.
[1:23:18] read in the King James, read it in the
[1:23:21] the other translation, the Living the
[1:23:23] Passion translation is a really good one
[1:23:26] and it really brings out the depths of
[1:23:29] this. But in this scripture, David is
[1:23:32] going through things and he's he's like
[1:23:34] and he's going working through all the
[1:23:36] things in his life and he's like, you
[1:23:37] know, I got enemies. I got the I can run
[1:23:39] over here, but I can't hide from you and
[1:23:41] all that. I can I can bring go into the
[1:23:43] dark and I still can't hide from you.
[1:23:45] And he's going down and finally he comes
[1:23:47] down
[1:23:49] and he says, "Lord, when I was being
[1:23:52] formed in secret
[1:23:55] and intricately and skillfully formed as
[1:23:58] embroidered with many colors in the
[1:24:00] depths of the earth, your eyes have seen
[1:24:03] my unformed substance and your book were
[1:24:06] all and in your book were all written
[1:24:08] the days that were appointed me. when as
[1:24:10] yet there has none, not one of them even
[1:24:12] taken shape. Before he was even born, he
[1:24:15] wrote books about you.
[1:24:18] How precious also your thoughts towards
[1:24:20] me, oh God, how vast is the sum of them.
[1:24:23] If I could count them, thou would
[1:24:25] outnumber the sun. When I wake, I am
[1:24:27] still with you. But he talks about how
[1:24:29] that you are fearfully and wonderfully
[1:24:32] made.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; You are a work of art.
[1:24:36] You are you are God's masterpiece.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; So why would we belittle
[1:24:48] you know what they did to them? They did
[1:24:50] it to the Mona Lisa. They threw tomato
[1:24:52] juice or something on it or they go get
[1:24:54] these statues and they throw this to to
[1:24:57] try to tear it take away the value of
[1:24:59] them and to do all this. Satan tried
[1:25:02] that on you. But God saw still value
[1:25:05] down there and he picked you up out of
[1:25:08] that old dirty slop pin and he started
[1:25:10] working on you.
[1:25:13] Started cleaning you up. Smoking fell
[1:25:16] away and drinking fell away. Alcohol up
[1:25:19] womanizing fell away. All these things
[1:25:21] begin to fall away. Situation things in
[1:25:23] your life and he cleans you out. And you
[1:25:27] remember that first day when you was
[1:25:29] clean.
[1:25:31] Satan tries to come and he tries to
[1:25:33] bring these spirits back into that
[1:25:36] vessel
[1:25:37] and he tries to come against it and
[1:25:39] attach itself on the outside to make it
[1:25:41] look dirty and unworthy.
[1:25:43] Tries to bring complexes
[1:25:46] when Listen, why
[1:25:49] if you had a million dollar painting on
[1:25:52] your wall, would any of y'all go and
[1:25:55] take some tomato soup and wipe all over
[1:25:57] it? Take some dirt and wipe all over it,
[1:26:01] deface it. No, it'd be worth it. It's
[1:26:03] worth something to you, especially if
[1:26:05] you paid for it.
[1:26:10] Why would we allow Satan to come and
[1:26:12] bring complexes and allow those
[1:26:14] complexes to come and bring down the
[1:26:17] real value of what's on the inside of us
[1:26:21] where we can serve God the way we should
[1:26:23] serve him where we could worship God the
[1:26:25] way we should worship him where we could
[1:26:27] give a complete unhindered freedom to
[1:26:30] praise him and to glorify him. Why would
[1:26:33] we allow a complex to devalue that?
[1:26:38] Listen to what G Philippians 2. I want
[1:26:40] to read this and amplified. Philippians
[1:26:42] 2 and verse one. Therefore, if there is
[1:26:45] any encouragement and comfort in Christ,
[1:26:47] as there certainly is in abundance, I
[1:26:50] like that. If there is any consolation
[1:26:53] of love, if there's any fellowship that
[1:26:55] we share in the spirit, if there's any
[1:26:57] great depth of affection and compassion,
[1:26:59] make my joy complete by being of the
[1:27:02] same mind, having the same love toward
[1:27:04] one another, knit together in spirit,
[1:27:06] intent on one purpose, and living a life
[1:27:08] that reflects your faith and spreads the
[1:27:10] gospel, the good news regarding
[1:27:12] salvation through faith in Christ. Do
[1:27:14] nothing from selfishness or empty
[1:27:17] conceit conceit and with the an attitude
[1:27:20] of humility being neither arrogant or
[1:27:23] self-righteous regard others as more
[1:27:26] important than yourselves.
[1:27:28] Do not merely look out for your own
[1:27:31] personal interest but also for the
[1:27:33] interest of others. Having this same
[1:27:35] attitude in yourself which was in Christ
[1:27:37] Jesus looked to him as your example of
[1:27:40] selfless humility who though he existed
[1:27:43] in the form and unchanging exa essence
[1:27:46] of God as one with him possessing the
[1:27:48] fullness of all divine attributes the
[1:27:51] entire nature of deity. Do not regard
[1:27:54] equality with God a thing to be grasped
[1:27:57] or asserted as if he did not already
[1:27:59] possess it or was afraid of losing it.
[1:28:02] In other words, he did not live through
[1:28:04] a complex.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Look at it. He He wasn't a He he he he
[1:28:10] didn't didn't doubt that he already
[1:28:12] possessed it. And neither was he afraid
[1:28:14] of losing it.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; He knew what it was like. He knew what
[1:28:18] it was to be there. He knew what it was
[1:28:20] like to be God cuz he was God.
[1:28:25] but emptied himself
[1:28:28] without renouncing or diminishing his
[1:28:31] deity but only temporarily giving up the
[1:28:34] outward expression of divine equality
[1:28:36] and his rightful dignity by assuming the
[1:28:38] form of a bondervant and being made in
[1:28:41] the likeness of men. He became
[1:28:43] completely human but was without sin
[1:28:45] being fully God and fully man.
[1:28:49] After he was found in the terms of his
[1:28:51] outward appear in the terms of outward
[1:28:53] appearance as a man for a divinely
[1:28:54] appointed time he humbled himself still
[1:28:57] further by becoming obedient to the
[1:28:59] father to the point of death even the
[1:29:01] death on the cross. And for this reason
[1:29:03] also because he obeyed and so completely
[1:29:06] humbled himself. God has highly exalted
[1:29:08] him and bestowed on him the name which
[1:29:11] is above every name. So that at the name
[1:29:13] of Jesus, every knee shall bow in
[1:29:16] submission of those who are in heaven
[1:29:18] and on earth and under the earth. And
[1:29:19] every tongue will confess and openly
[1:29:22] acknowledge that Jesus Christ is the
[1:29:24] Lord's sovereign God to the glory of God
[1:29:27] the Father.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:30] So because that he would refused to bow
[1:29:32] down to complexes that enabled him to
[1:29:35] even go and give up his life
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; to humble himself even further.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; This is where people can't come to the
[1:29:47] point of dying out because they're not
[1:29:50] willing to die to that complex,
[1:29:54] that thing that has sat there and kept
[1:29:55] them from going on with God. Kept them
[1:29:57] from moving another step. kept they
[1:29:59] always come to that point and go back.
[1:30:04] But Jesus not living under this complex,
[1:30:08] he was willing to die. He was willing to
[1:30:11] lay it all down. And in laying it all
[1:30:13] down, he was exalted.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Listen, you're never going to be
[1:30:19] exalted. You're never going to be in a
[1:30:21] rapture unless you lay it all down.
[1:30:30] Many times in our lives, we grow up in
[1:30:32] situations. We get in things in our
[1:30:34] lives and situations that causes us hurt
[1:30:36] for so long.
[1:30:40] And if we're not careful, we'll turn
[1:30:41] that hurt towards God
[1:30:44] and that hatred towards God
[1:30:49] has been speaking to a young man who had
[1:30:51] a dear loss trying to find his way. And
[1:30:55] it's like I
[1:30:57] I just encourage him. Look, don't don't
[1:30:59] turn this towards God. God was there to
[1:31:02] receive your child.
[1:31:05] This didn't happen because God of God.
[1:31:06] This happened because of the devil.
[1:31:09] This happened because of the fall and
[1:31:11] took him through the fall and where sin
[1:31:13] entered in. and why we're living under
[1:31:14] this curse. I said, "But if you'll turn
[1:31:16] it towards God, if you turn your hatred
[1:31:19] towards God, you'll never get you'll
[1:31:21] never get the freedom and the real need
[1:31:23] and the real things met that you really
[1:31:25] need."
[1:31:27] But if you'll turn it towards who really
[1:31:29] belongs on
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; this is where people get they they they
[1:31:34] come and they get so angry. Why did God
[1:31:35] allow this? Why did God allow God was
[1:31:37] God? Why?
[1:31:39] Sometimes it was done because we got
[1:31:41] ourselves in some stupid situations. We
[1:31:43] done it to ourselves.
[1:31:45] But it's the real blame belongs on
[1:31:48] Satan.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; I think of Adam and Eve. They never
[1:31:58] dealt with a complex until they sinned.
[1:32:01] Then they had a complex towards God and
[1:32:04] they went and made fig leaves to try to
[1:32:06] hide themselves, but they couldn't hide
[1:32:07] from him. God saw through their own
[1:32:10] man-made things. And God will see
[1:32:12] through your things every time.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; This is what David read. You go read it.
[1:32:17] David said, "I can go into the dark." He
[1:32:19] said, "But dark is light to you cuz
[1:32:20] you're light.
[1:32:22] When you come, you're just enlightened
[1:32:24] my darkness and I can't even hide there.
[1:32:26] If I go down into the depths, you're
[1:32:28] there. If I go up in, you're there.
[1:32:33] All I know is one day
[1:32:36] all of this stuff that we're dealing
[1:32:38] with is going to be fixed.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; All I can say is come Jesus come.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; I just I just end it with this thought.
[1:32:51] Brother Brandham talking about it's one
[1:32:52] of my favorite quotes.
[1:32:55] Pardon me for just a moment.
[1:32:58] So one day we'll see him
[1:33:01] and it'll not be as we are now, but
[1:33:04] we'll know how to love him even more.
[1:33:07] We'll not stand back with even a little
[1:33:09] fear.
[1:33:11] Think about that. Not even a little fear
[1:33:14] because we'll be like him. We'll be more
[1:33:16] like a rel he'll be more like a relative
[1:33:18] to us than he is now. We'll understand
[1:33:20] him better because we're so far away in
[1:33:22] these mortal bodies. But then we'll have
[1:33:25] a body like his own glorious body. Oh,
[1:33:28] we'll know how to worship him. When we
[1:33:30] see that presence of his being, what
[1:33:32] he's done for us, changed us, the old
[1:33:34] back to young, and all the deformed
[1:33:35] straightened out. We understand stand
[1:33:38] then why his power healed us. All the
[1:33:41] questions that's been in our mind. How
[1:33:42] can he do this? Why did this happen?
[1:33:44] What happened? Somehow mysteriously,
[1:33:47] they all fade away.
[1:33:50] And the knots that's been tied in the
[1:33:53] back of our minds, will it be this? How
[1:33:55] could this be? What? Somehow or another,
[1:33:58] those majestic fingers will just
[1:34:00] untangle and unravel those knots, and
[1:34:04] it'll all fade into one big crown of
[1:34:06] love.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm ready
[1:34:09] for those fingers.
[1:34:12] God, I got a lot of knots in my mind and
[1:34:14] things that I've dealt with and
[1:34:15] situations wondering why and situations
[1:34:18] and and then find find myself pulling
[1:34:20] back sometimes and find myself want to
[1:34:22] just go back in the shadows. Why? I
[1:34:24] don't even want to do what I'm doing.
[1:34:25] Just get out of here. But that's not
[1:34:27] what God called me to be. That's not
[1:34:29] what God called me to do. And listen,
[1:34:31] God didn't call us to be in the shadows.
[1:34:33] God called us to be a city, a light that
[1:34:35] is set on a hill.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; He called us to let our light shine. And
[1:34:40] the darker it gets, the more your light
[1:34:42] ought to be shining.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; God, don't let some complex come, some
[1:34:48] shade of some complex come over and dim
[1:34:51] my light, but let my light just get
[1:34:53] brighter and brighter and brighter and
[1:34:55] brighter until it breaks into that
[1:34:56] beautiful day. Then all those knots are
[1:34:59] going to just fade away.
[1:35:01] God bless you tonight. Let's bow our
[1:35:03] hearts.
[1:35:21] Sometimes we get a complex because we
[1:35:23] come to him so broken,
[1:35:26] broken humanity.
[1:35:28] We feel so unworthy,
[1:35:32] so been so abused and so messed up and
[1:35:35] mistreated and so broken. What could God
[1:35:37] do with this? Well, I just tell you
[1:35:40] again, as I probably I know I've said it
[1:35:42] here before, but over in Japan, they use
[1:35:45] this this method of broken pottery.
[1:35:49] Maybe somebody dropped their antique
[1:35:52] that was handed down through
[1:35:53] generations,
[1:35:55] worth a lot of money, and they fell on
[1:35:56] the floor. all broken and shattered.
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:05] But those masters take that broken
[1:36:07] pottery and they start piecing them back
[1:36:09] together and they use gold.
[1:36:15] And those pottery pieces
[1:36:18] actually become more valuable
[1:36:21] after they're broken and fixed by these
[1:36:23] masters because the gold that's on the
[1:36:27] inside of those cracks and crevices
[1:36:29] [Music]
[1:36:32] become very beautiful, very soughta
[1:36:35] masterpieces
[1:36:38] because of bro being broken but being
[1:36:41] allow allowing themselves to be put in
[1:36:43] the hands of the pastor
[1:36:46] and all those broken pieces be put back
[1:36:49] together again.
[1:36:51] [Music]
[1:36:57] Scripture says, "My people will never be
[1:37:00] ashamed."
[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:04] My people will never be ashamed. You
[1:37:08] might be feel broken this this evening.
[1:37:10] You might feel so misused and torn. What
[1:37:12] what what use do I have to God? If
[1:37:15] you'll just come and just lay yourself
[1:37:16] in his hands, he'll fill all that
[1:37:19] brokenness with deity.
[1:37:21] He'll fill all that brokenness with gold
[1:37:24] [Music]
[1:37:26] and make you to a vessel that's worthy
[1:37:29] for his table.
[1:37:32] [Music]
[1:37:33] And your value will be more greater
[1:37:37] than it was before.
[1:37:43] Maybe just talk to the Lord. I I'm not
[1:37:45] even going to ask for hands.
[1:37:48] I knew this service was going to be a
[1:37:49] little different. Didn't know how.
[1:37:51] [Music]
[1:37:53] I know it's for a purpose.
[1:37:58] Know it's for a purpose.
[1:38:00] Lord, I want you to say, "Lord, I'm
[1:38:03] sorry I've allowed this complex to come
[1:38:04] up,
[1:38:06] become greater than you are.
[1:38:10] I'm sorry that I allowed it to rule my
[1:38:12] life.
[1:38:13] I'm sorry that I allowed it to lead me
[1:38:16] and guide me to places. Lord, tonight I
[1:38:21] want to move away from this and lay it
[1:38:24] at your altar.
[1:38:25] And Lord, I want to re try this spirit
[1:38:29] if it's not of God. And I want to come
[1:38:32] back to the one true God
[1:38:35] and let him lead me. Let him guide me.
[1:38:41] That be your desire tonight,
[1:38:44] Lord Jesus.
[1:38:46] See our hearts today, Lord.
[1:38:50] Lord, just see sometimes how we allow
[1:38:52] things to rise up in our lives from our
[1:38:54] past, past hurts, mistakes, abuses,
[1:38:58] whatever
[1:39:00] complexes come and never able to see how
[1:39:04] truly our worth and never able to
[1:39:07] operate in the path place that you
[1:39:09] called us to operate in.
[1:39:12] Never truly be able to yield our gift
[1:39:14] because of complexes.
[1:39:16] [Music]
[1:39:19] or Lord, because of complexes we look
[1:39:21] down on other people's gifts. Lord,
[1:39:24] there's all kinds of things that the
[1:39:25] devil can come and try to tangle us up
[1:39:28] in and tie us up. But Lord, tonight, may
[1:39:31] your majestic fingers just untangle some
[1:39:33] knots.
[1:39:35] Lord, as we lay ourselves at your feet,
[1:39:37] Father, may you just come, I pray, and
[1:39:40] Lord, just move through this audience
[1:39:42] and through through every heart here,
[1:39:44] Lord. You know each heart. Father, they
[1:39:47] know, Lord. They've tried to hide behind
[1:39:49] that tree. They've tried to climb up and
[1:39:52] just get back in them leaves and hide
[1:39:54] from you. But Lord, today you come and
[1:39:56] looked up in the tree and said, "Hey,
[1:39:58] I'm going home with you tonight."
[1:40:02] Oh God, let us yield ourselves to you
[1:40:05] completely. I pray
[1:40:08] in Jesus name.
[1:40:11] Jesus. Sometimes I fall.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Oh yes
[1:40:18] to my knees and pray.
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:25] Oh come Jesus come. Let today be the
[1:40:29] day.
[1:40:31] Let today be the day.
[1:40:38] Sometimes I feel
[1:40:44] like I'm going to break,
[1:40:50] but I'm holding on
[1:40:56] to a hope that won't fade.
[1:41:02] So come Jesus come.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; We've been waiting so long
[1:41:15] for the day you return
[1:41:18] to heal every hurt

[1:42:05] and we'll stand face to face.
[1:42:11] Come and lay it on
[1:42:17] cuz it might be today.
[1:42:24] Oh, the time is right now
[1:42:30] and there's no need to wait.
[1:42:36] Your path will be washed.
[1:42:42] Oh, by rivers of grace,
[1:42:46] [Music]
[1:42:48] so from Jesus Christ.

[1:43:01] for the day of return
[1:43:05] to heal everyone.

[1:49:08] free. So I could be whole. So I could

[1:58:44] You've been walking the same old road
[1:58:47] for miles and miles.
