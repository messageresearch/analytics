[27:26] suffer loss but we suffered a loss
[27:29] we suffered a very special person and
[27:31] our family of course has kind of been
[27:34] more i would say acclimated to death as
[27:36] we just had the death of jessica's
[27:38] brother and then just a few years ago
[27:39] her dad
[27:41] so we know what it means to grieve we
[27:43] know what it means to suffer loss but we
[27:44] also know the joy of knowing that
[27:46] there's others that love you and that
[27:48] care about you and that show their
[27:50] support

[27:56] tell you those moments don't go
[27:58] unnoticed
[28:00] they mean a lot they mean a lot to the
[28:01] family they mean a lot to but this is a
[28:03] great church
[28:05] and uh i couldn't see the family i
[28:08] couldn't see the butt family my family
[28:10] us serving god anywhere else but right
[28:12] here and even like tabernacle as we see
[28:15] the times of the ages drawing to a close
[28:18] i'm glad that we have believers true
[28:20] genuine honest born-again sons and
[28:22] daughters of god to fight this fight
[28:24] with
[28:25] you're we're in a special place church
[28:28] don't take any service for granted don't
[28:30] take any brother or sister for granted
[28:32] god has placed us here together to do
[28:35] battle
[28:36] and i look around i see great men of god
[28:38] i see great sisters and daughters of god
[28:40] i couldn't dare wouldn't dare want to
[28:42] fight this battle with anybody else
[28:45] so now that we've suffered a loss you
[28:47] know what the next best thing to do is
[28:49] just strap on our boots and be
[28:50] determined to fight
[28:53] be determined to fight we're not going
[28:54] to back down we're not going to give up
[28:56] we're not going to give in we're going
[28:58] to draw our swords and we're going to
[28:59] fight another day because we're going to
[29:01] face another battle and god's promise to
[29:03] give us another victory
[29:05] so we just thank the lord for that let's
[29:07] just go to him in prayer this evening
[29:08] father
[29:10] we do thank you lord for this church
[29:13] not just the building lord the four
[29:15] walls the fellowship hall all the other
[29:17] amenities that are here but father i
[29:19] thank you for each and every person
[29:22] that calls us their home church
[29:24] i thank you lord for their prayers and
[29:26] their support to the ministry and to the
[29:28] musicians and to what they bring to this
[29:30] local body lord as they begin to pull on
[29:32] the gift of god
[29:34] god it's what changes the atmosphere in
[29:36] the service the ministers only have a
[29:38] part to play lord but it's the it's
[29:40] those that are listening it's those that
[29:41] are pulling it's us as a collective body
[29:44] or putting our shoulders to the will and
[29:46] god and just giving our all for the
[29:48] service of the lord so i just asked
[29:50] tonight
[29:52] god i ask that you put the words in my
[29:53] mouth and you'd put the anointing on
[29:55] their ears to hear exactly what you
[29:57] would have us to say tonight
[29:59] god as i looked at this thought several
[30:01] weeks ago and just
[30:02] really didn't see the inspiration or
[30:04] feel the inspiration behind it and set
[30:06] it aside and lord just this week you
[30:09] rekindled that inspiration so father we
[30:11] just commit this service to you tonight
[30:14] we commit every believer here
[30:16] and lord we especially lift up the
[30:18] pruitt butts family tonight father
[30:21] know that they're still grieving and
[30:23] we just want them to know lord that
[30:24] they're loved
[30:26] and they're not in this battle alone
[30:27] we've all are in this together tonight
[30:29] but we have a promise we have a
[30:31] consolation
[30:32] that you said lord you would be there
[30:35] you'd be with us even in us to the very
[30:38] end so father we're leaning upon you
[30:39] tonight drawing our strength from you
[30:42] and we ask that you bless this service
[30:44] lord and we thank you for this time
[30:45] you've given us
[30:46] and just ask that you just
[30:48] move in our hearts moving our lives
[30:50] speak as you will lord in jesus name
[30:53] amen if you would have your bibles
[30:54] tonight we're going to look here in
[30:55] isaiah 59.
[31:00] isaiah 59 and we'll start at verse 17
[31:02] and read through verse 21 collectively
[31:05] and before we go there i want to read a
[31:06] scripture out of isaiah 35 as i was in
[31:09] the back and just nerved up for the
[31:12] service and you know you
[31:14] you it follows your lot to come behind
[31:16] such a special lady and a wonderful
[31:19] memorial service just the other day and
[31:21] you know you begin to stumble what do
[31:22] you say to the family what do you say to
[31:24] the church body after suffering such a
[31:27] great loss and as i as i was flipping
[31:30] through and just kind of fell open to
[31:31] this isaiah 35 and verse 4 it says say
[31:34] to them that are a fearful heart be
[31:36] strong and fear not
[31:39] your god will come with vengeance
[31:41] even god with the recompense he will
[31:44] come
[31:44] and save you
[31:46] i don't know about you with that comfort
[31:48] of me because i'm a ball of nerves right
[31:49] now just because i know what's
[31:51] was to be spoken i know kind of how i'm
[31:53] going to deliver this at least i feel it
[31:55] in my spirit this is not going to be
[31:57] what i would call my typical danny
[31:59] rooster as
[32:00] uh sister karen would call me running
[32:02] around running around running around but
[32:04] just kind of try to lay the word in
[32:05] there no brother aaron i'm not gonna
[32:07] teach
[32:08] we're all uh relieved tonight but isaiah
[32:11] 59 and verse 17 he says for he
[32:14] put on the on righteousness as a
[32:17] breastplate
[32:18] and a helmet of salvation upon his head
[32:20] and he put on garments of vengeance for
[32:23] clothing and was clad with zeal as a
[32:26] cloak
[32:26] according to their deeds accordingly he
[32:29] will repay fury to his adversaries
[32:31] recompense to his enemies
[32:33] to the islands he will repay recompense
[32:36] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[32:38] from the west and his glory from the
[32:40] rising of the sun when the enemy shall
[32:42] come in like a flood the spirit of the
[32:44] lord shall lift up a standard against
[32:45] him and the redeemer shall come to zion
[32:49] and unto them that turn from
[32:50] transgressions in jacob saith the lord
[32:53] as for me this is my covenant with them
[32:55] saith the lord
[32:57] my spirit that is upon me my words which
[32:59] i have put in thy mouth shall not depart
[33:02] out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of
[33:04] thy seed
[33:06] nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed
[33:08] saith the lord from henceforth
[33:10] and evermore
[33:12] god bless you you can have your seats
[33:13] tonight i just want to take a few
[33:15] moments this evening
[33:17] and we will speak to you on the standard
[33:20] has been lifted
[33:22] we have heard this and we have quoted
[33:24] this when the enemy comes in like a
[33:25] flood like a flood like a flood like a
[33:28] flood god's going to raise a standard
[33:30] raise a standard razor standard so i
[33:32] just kind of want to look at that
[33:33] tonight and i'll get to my my thought
[33:37] later on in this message but i just want
[33:38] to kind of build it and coming out of
[33:40] israel in the church brother branham
[33:41] will say no wonder christianity can't
[33:44] even lift up a standard it's because not
[33:46] because christ is not able but because
[33:49] the people won't do it
[33:51] so notice where he's putting the
[33:53] responsibility of lifting the standard
[33:56] it's not that christ won't do it he said
[33:58] the people won't do it the message is
[34:00] ready
[34:01] the power of god is sufficient
[34:04] men and women are scared to break out
[34:06] yonder into those fears before god and
[34:09] dare to trust him and take his word
[34:13] you know if you go around like brother
[34:14] aaron and i in different ministries you
[34:16] go to different churches and you find
[34:18] some churches they're afraid of the
[34:20] supernatural
[34:22] they're
[34:23] they're timid against the presence of
[34:25] the lord but yet
[34:27] because they're not they don't maybe
[34:28] they don't see it maybe it's not there
[34:30] in their church often enough but we find
[34:32] they become scared and they are scared
[34:34] to reach out into the supernatural break
[34:37] out yawning to the fears of god and dare
[34:39] to trust god dare to say god do what
[34:42] your word declares you're going to do
[34:44] and hold god responsible for his word
[34:47] all you got to do is remind god of what
[34:49] he said in his word
[34:52] so we find though in isaiah 59 and verse
[34:54] 17 and i love this because it shows what
[34:56] kind of god we serve he's not a passive
[34:58] god he's not a deletorio grandpa sitting
[35:01] back just gonna do nothing waiting on
[35:04] this but the bible says he puts on
[35:06] righteousness as a breastplate he puts
[35:08] on a helmet of salvation on his head and
[35:11] he puts on garments of vengeance god is
[35:13] dressing himself to do battle
[35:17] not to do battle for his own benefit but
[35:19] he is preparing to repay your enemy with
[35:22] fury he's really he's ready to to repay
[35:25] your adversary that's transgressed you
[35:28] he's going to pour out recompense upon
[35:30] recompense upon recompense and we find
[35:33] that the god that we serve is not a
[35:35] passive
[35:36] god but he's a warrior god and not only
[35:39] is he a warrior god in heaven but he's a
[35:41] warrior god for your need for your
[35:43] situation for your trial for the
[35:45] darkness that you're going through he's
[35:47] a warrior god and i want you to know
[35:49] that he's got the helmet of salvation on
[35:52] he's got the breastplate on but not only
[35:54] that he's clothed himself in vengeance
[35:57] he is ready in this hour to pour out
[36:00] upon your adversary and raise the
[36:02] standard against your foe to lift up the
[36:06] standard against your accuser our god is
[36:09] able he's willing and he's ready tonight
[36:11] to do battle with your enemy
[36:13] [Applause]
[36:17] so we know but the bible will tell us
[36:18] when the enemy comes in a lot of times
[36:20] we get fretful so what if he comes
[36:23] how many of you have never faced the
[36:24] enemy
[36:26] all right good i'm on good ground then
[36:29] but we finally isaiah 59 that when the
[36:31] enemy comes in not if he comes in but
[36:34] when he comes in and certainly he's
[36:36] going to come
[36:38] and he's relentless in his efforts to
[36:40] warp the plan of god and the movement of
[36:42] the spirit of god and if he can just get
[36:44] somebody now preoccupied tonight with
[36:47] what you're going to do tomorrow then
[36:49] he's already defeated you in the service
[36:51] tonight
[36:52] so he's coming so you got to keep your
[36:54] mind you got to keep your mind sharp
[36:55] under that anointing in the spirit
[36:57] because he's coming in to thwart the
[36:59] movement of the spirit no matter how
[37:01] that may be or it's not just with
[37:03] sickness not just with some major trial
[37:06] but even in the service get you
[37:07] preoccupied with what oh school's
[37:10] opening up this week
[37:12] so i got to go get my pencil sharpeners
[37:14] and i got to go do this and i got to do
[37:16] that and i got to get my supplies and
[37:17] your minds all wrapped around what you
[37:19] got to do tomorrow and you're missing
[37:21] the movement of the spirit he's here
[37:23] tonight to raise a standard for you so
[37:25] keep your mind in tune with the spirit
[37:27] tonight
[37:29] but we find the devil loves to buffet
[37:31] you every chance that he gets
[37:36] i like how paul will tell us and we know
[37:38] in second corinthians 12 he says lest i
[37:40] should be exalted above measure through
[37:42] the abundance of revelation
[37:45] there was given to me a thorn in the
[37:47] flesh a messenger of satan to buffet me
[37:50] and that word buffett means to beat with
[37:52] a fist
[37:55] so i want some of you young boys come up
[37:57] here and let brother aaron beat you with
[37:58] his fist
[38:01] who said no
[38:03] well then we'll let brother johnny he's
[38:04] got bigger guns anyway
[38:07] hey
[38:08] the looking at those guns will make me
[38:10] run
[38:12] but we find the devil is there to beat
[38:15] with the fist to buff it to my tree to
[38:18] treat with excessive force
[38:22] to punish
[38:24] he's not here passing out lollipops
[38:27] he's not here like my mother does every
[38:29] service when when she comes to church
[38:31] giving my little daughter a bag of candy
[38:33] that's not how he works no he's giving
[38:35] you a bag of fist
[38:36] he's
[38:37] he's buffing in you he's punishing you
[38:39] he's using excessive force and he's
[38:41] causing affliction upon affliction and
[38:43] the problem that god will say in the
[38:44] message experiences he said the
[38:46] messenger of the devil he said that word
[38:49] buffett there means to blow after blow
[38:52] after blow after blow after blow after
[38:54] blow
[38:56] how many times you feel like man you
[38:58] can't get out of one trial without being
[39:00] right back into another trial and if
[39:02] you're not really got one foot in the
[39:04] trial he's there knocking you out of
[39:06] this trial into that trial he sees
[39:08] everything you do every time you wake up
[39:10] you're in one blow after another blow
[39:12] after another blow i say thanks be to
[39:14] god tonight
[39:15] he said what do you mean thanks i said
[39:17] what that means to me is that the devil
[39:19] don't have you if he's blowing after you
[39:22] and hit you here and hit you there that
[39:24] goes to show that he don't have you and
[39:25] he's just trying to knock you off your
[39:27] pedestal
[39:28] he's trying to knock you down and keep
[39:30] the movement of the spirit of god away
[39:31] from you
[39:34] so there was a messenger of the devil to
[39:36] buffett paul
[39:37] blow after blow after blow and the
[39:40] prophet of god would say and i will
[39:41] admit
[39:42] that god permits satan sometimes to
[39:45] chastise us that's true
[39:49] but when that chastisement is through
[39:51] you come back to god
[39:53] god your father will heal you and that's
[39:56] right
[39:58] so don't only apply it on healing the
[40:00] supernatural deliverance but apply it on
[40:02] every aspect of your life whatever
[40:04] you're going through
[40:05] and he's blowing and he's hitting and
[40:07] he's coming against you
[40:09] you know that you can come back to god
[40:11] because god is always there and god is
[40:13] going to fight your battle god is going
[40:14] to raise that standard and god will heal
[40:17] god will deliver god will see you
[40:19] through whatever you're going through
[40:22] in the message testimony he said the
[40:23] theme of my revivals is this declaring
[40:25] to the world that jesus christ is the
[40:28] same yesterday today and forever and
[40:31] through every critic and every type of
[40:34] criticism that i know that satan has led
[40:36] me with these statements and i'm giving
[40:39] jesus christ he has done everything that
[40:42] i know can be done speaking of to try to
[40:44] overthrow it but every time god has
[40:47] brought it out triumphant and won the
[40:49] victory every time
[40:53] he says check it test it by the
[40:54] government agents everywhere through
[40:56] nations every time i have a thorn in the
[40:59] flesh an angel of satan who knows or who
[41:02] follows and tries to buff it or beset
[41:06] but he's defeated in every case by the
[41:09] holy spirit and god come out triumphant
[41:12] winning hundreds and thousands to christ
[41:15] in that time
[41:16] so church tonight no matter what you're
[41:18] going through no matter what you're
[41:20] facing the god that we serve the god
[41:23] that declared that i will be with you
[41:26] the god that said here say unto them do
[41:29] not be a fearful heart but be strong
[41:31] fear not behold your god will come and
[41:34] when he comes he's coming with vengeance
[41:37] he's coming with force he's coming to do
[41:40] what to recompense your adversary for
[41:42] what he has put you through it doesn't
[41:44] go unnoticed god is taking notice of
[41:47] what the devil has done to you and god
[41:49] is raising a standard against it god is
[41:51] elevating the bar to tell you you're not
[41:53] alone my child you're not alone my
[41:56] daughter god knows your need and god is
[41:58] here to raise you up and to lift you up
[42:01] above the situation
[42:05] and notice not one time has our god ever
[42:09] been defeated
[42:12] oh it may look humanly
[42:15] what we saw
[42:16] we believed and we prayed for our sister
[42:18] karen and it looked maybe human that god
[42:21] felt was god didn't fail us god had a
[42:23] better plan
[42:27] god had a better plan let me tell you i
[42:29] trade places right now
[42:31] because where she's at is where we long
[42:33] to be
[42:35] where she's at is where we're headed to
[42:39] but it may look like well she went down
[42:41] in the feet no she didn't go down in the
[42:43] feet
[42:44] because the bible tells us faith is our
[42:47] victory
[42:48] if you look in first john 5 and 4 it
[42:50] says for whatsoever is born of god
[42:54] overcometh the world and this
[42:56] is the victory that overcometh the world
[42:58] even our
[43:00] faith
[43:01] and his brother tim so poetically put it
[43:04] the other night or the other day when he
[43:05] preached she died a long time ago
[43:09] when he was going through the church age
[43:10] study that's where karen pruitt died
[43:15] and that's where each of us have to get
[43:17] to that place where we die die out to
[43:19] our sin sinful selves die out to our
[43:22] unbelief
[43:23] die out to everything and let god make
[43:26] us anew
[43:27] so that we can have the same testimony
[43:30] so that we can live up to the same level
[43:32] the standard that has been set before us
[43:36] so we find faith is our victory in
[43:38] isaiah 54 and verse 17 the bible tells
[43:41] us so plainly no weapon that is formed
[43:43] against thee shall prosper and every
[43:46] tongue that shall rise against thee in
[43:48] judgment thou shall condemn
[43:52] now how many of you when you're faced
[43:54] with trial do you remember this
[43:55] scripture
[43:57] not very many of us do we
[43:59] man you guys got hit and beat by
[44:02] the devil's fist and he's buffeting you
[44:04] and buffing you the last thing you can
[44:06] think about is no weapon all you're
[44:07] trying to do is get this weapon off of
[44:08] me
[44:10] but we find here it may appear that
[44:12] satan is women the winning the battle
[44:14] that is weapon against you whatever that
[44:16] may be is triumphant and it's beating
[44:18] you in it's taking its toll on you but
[44:21] no weapon that is formed against you is
[44:23] going to prosper no weapon that satan
[44:25] has put upon you tonight is going to be
[44:27] successful because the god that you
[44:29] serve and the god that's called you and
[44:31] the god that's anointed you and the god
[44:33] that's filled you is raising up a
[44:35] standard tonight
[44:37] he's lifting the bar the anointing
[44:40] pouring out his holy spirit pouring out
[44:42] the supernatural to let you know you're
[44:44] not forsaken little church you're not
[44:46] just some beat down little nobody but
[44:49] you're my pride you're the apple of my
[44:51] eye and i'm gonna do whatever i've got
[44:53] to do to pull you through it and god
[44:56] will do that and that right quick
[44:59] god's not gonna leave you stranded
[45:01] fighting your enemy no weapon formed
[45:03] against you
[45:06] will prosper
[45:08] the weapon of brain bleach tried and
[45:10] tried and tried several times
[45:14] to take the life of karen pruitt but it
[45:16] was not successful
[45:18] brain bleeds didn't take her god took
[45:20] her and called her home
[45:24] brain bleeds may have tried to
[45:26] her life and humiliate her and put her
[45:29] in a hospital room
[45:30] but she never once recanted her faith
[45:33] she never once turned her back on god so
[45:35] what does that tell you it tells devil
[45:37] you don't have enough
[45:40] in the midst of the darkest tower in the
[45:42] midst of the lowest moment she remained
[45:44] faithful the pruitt family remained
[45:46] faithful the church remained faithful we
[45:49] remain faithful to what to the call of
[45:51] god to the word of god
[45:54] so no weapon tonight that is pointed at
[45:56] you will be successful against you
[46:02] the bible will tell us in hebrews
[46:06] the hall of faith chapter 11
[46:09] speaking of abel and he naked noah and
[46:11] abraham and sarah
[46:13] and verse 13 it says all these dies in
[46:16] faith
[46:18] tell god in faith not having received
[46:22] the promise
[46:24] not having received
[46:26] but having seen it
[46:29] notice now having seen it afar off and
[46:32] they were persuaded of them
[46:35] notice what they did next and they
[46:37] embraced
[46:39] them
[46:40] they embraced the promises
[46:42] they embraced the word of god
[46:45] died in faith
[46:47] having not received
[46:49] but were fully persuaded and embraced
[46:51] the promise
[46:53] is when they woke up that day god was
[46:55] going to move
[46:57] and we find here in hebrews 11 and verse
[46:59] 33
[47:01] who through faith notice now let me go
[47:04] back to 32 excuse me
[47:06] and what shall i say more for the time
[47:08] shall fail me to tell of gideon and
[47:10] barack and samson and jephthah
[47:13] of david also and samuel and the
[47:15] prophets
[47:16] notice who through faith they subdue
[47:19] kingdoms
[47:20] wrought righteousness obtain promises
[47:23] stop the mouths of lions quench the
[47:25] violence of fire escape the edge of the
[47:27] sword out of wickedness we're made
[47:29] strong wax violent and fight
[47:31] turn the flight of the armies of the
[47:33] aliens women received their dead rays to
[47:36] life again
[47:39] wow don't you aren't you glad we got
[47:41] that in our heritage
[47:43] man that means every day when i wake up
[47:45] it's going to be like that man i'm going
[47:46] to subdue kingdoms today i'm going to
[47:49] write righteous i'm going to attain the
[47:50] promise man let a lie roar against me
[47:52] brother and i'm going to shut his mouth
[47:54] up
[47:55] but if you keep on reading others
[47:58] we're tortured
[47:59] that's right
[48:00] not accepting deliverance that they
[48:02] might obtain a better resurrection and
[48:04] others had trial of cruel mockings and
[48:07] scourgings yay more over a bonds and
[48:09] imprisonments they were stoned they were
[48:12] sewn asunder they were tempted they were
[48:14] slain with the sword they wondered about
[48:16] in sheepskins and ghost skins being
[48:19] destitute afflicted and tormented of
[48:22] whom the world
[48:24] was not worthy
[48:25] they wandered in deserts and in
[48:27] mountains and indians and in caves of
[48:29] the earth and all these having attained
[48:31] a good report through faith receive not
[48:34] the promise
[48:37] and yet god having provided some
[48:40] better things for us
[48:42] in this hour the finality of all history
[48:46] of all time
[48:48] god has provided us a better word than
[48:50] they ever had in any other age because
[48:52] now not only do we have all the problems
[48:55] of it the previous sages we got all the
[48:56] blessings of the previous ages
[48:59] compounded down upon this sage so not
[49:01] only do you fight one of the greatest
[49:03] battles but you get the greatest reward
[49:06] so we find here god having provided some
[49:08] better thing for us that they without us
[49:12] should not be made perfect
[49:14] what am i telling you i'm telling you
[49:16] tomorrow you make up you may wake up and
[49:18] you may subdue lions
[49:20] you may subdue kingdoms or you may wake
[49:23] up and you may be wander around in the
[49:24] mountain or on the deserts you may be
[49:27] wandering in dms you may be destitute
[49:29] you may be afflicted but it doesn't
[49:30] matter because god was with those that
[49:33] were victorious and god was with those
[49:35] that were in trial god never left them
[49:37] god was always there and let me tell you
[49:39] a little church evening like god is
[49:40] waiting on you and they are waiting on
[49:43] you god is raising a banner and you are
[49:45] that banner you are the standard and
[49:48] leave the light you are the standard and
[49:49] laodicea god is lifting up the bar to
[49:52] tell you that someday there's going to
[49:54] be a crowning time there's going to be a
[49:56] homecoming time god's gonna take his
[49:58] little bride home
[50:00] because somebody is waiting the
[50:02] champion's on the other side they're
[50:04] waiting on us they're waiting on you to
[50:06] do what to fulfill your role to do your
[50:09] responsibility don't you worry about
[50:11] what you're going through know that god
[50:13] is raising the standard in the source
[50:16] god is elevating the word in this hour
[50:24] job 14 and verse 1.
[50:28] and some of us feel like this many days
[50:32] man that is born of a woman
[50:34] is of a few days in full trouble
[50:38] feel like every day you wake up trouble
[50:43] go down to the store trouble
[50:45] go to walmart trouble
[50:47] sometimes you even come to church
[50:48] trouble
[50:50] at least trouble on the way to church
[50:52] sometimes it's troubled in church
[50:55] and we find her adam
[50:57] was not born of a woman
[51:00] and adam lived 930 years
[51:02] but the atom that was born from woman
[51:05] was three score and ten
[51:07] few days
[51:09] just a few days
[51:11] and adam had trouble
[51:13] this adam our adam we have trouble
[51:16] there's days that we face lions
[51:19] and then there's days we subdue kingdoms
[51:21] we have good great days mountain top
[51:24] experience
[51:25] then we have our valleys
[51:28] we have our moments where we sink real
[51:29] low and when you get to that low point
[51:31] you got to know that the property god
[51:33] would say be certain of god
[51:36] when he lays there and he's quiet and he
[51:39] fails to move or appears that he doesn't
[51:41] move appears that he's not listening you
[51:43] got to be certain as a believer that god
[51:45] is there
[51:47] so we find man that is born of a woman
[51:49] we have difficult times on the earth
[51:51] because we bypass the original plan of
[51:53] god due to the fall we bypassed our
[51:55] theophanies and now we're here as
[51:57] believers and we're full of trouble some
[51:59] of you you know i'm not even going to
[52:00] ask you because some of you live in a
[52:02] down moment
[52:03] you gotta find some people that are
[52:04] always negative
[52:07] you got some people that are always high
[52:10] you know i wish i was that high person
[52:12] all the time thankfully i'm kind of
[52:14] balanced
[52:17] don't laugh
[52:18] if you're honest you'd be right there
[52:20] with me we're on the same roller coaster
[52:23] a roller coaster of life
[52:25] and some of us never get off the ground
[52:27] though
[52:28] i ain't getting known i'm scared
[52:30] i ain't getting no no that's the way no
[52:32] supernatural huh not me
[52:35] don't you believe that conspiracy stuff
[52:37] that coronavirus was created over there
[52:40] and we just live on conspiracy and we
[52:42] and negative negative negative negative
[52:47] god is here to raise a standard
[52:50] his word this message is a standard by
[52:52] which he's lifting up to a people
[52:55] and let me tell you if god has raised
[52:56] that bar for our people god is going to
[52:58] raise the people to meet that bar
[53:02] god's not going to set that bar to you
[53:04] young people you young boys can't attain
[53:06] to it there's going to be young boys
[53:07] that overcome pornography there's going
[53:09] to be young girls that overcome fear and
[53:11] depression and suicide anxiety there's
[53:13] going to be people sons and daughters of
[53:15] god in this age in this church that's
[53:17] going to raise up to the bar and not
[53:20] only we're going to raise to the bar but
[53:21] our bodies are going to be changed and
[53:23] we're going to go past the bar
[53:25] we're going to go past the standard that
[53:27] was built here for three score and ten
[53:30] because these bodies one day are gonna
[53:32] take a change
[53:34] there'll be no more memorial services
[53:37] there'll be no more tears shed
[53:42] psalms 34 and verse 19
[53:45] as you turn there we find though that we
[53:48] bypass our theophany
[53:50] and we as believers we have good days we
[53:52] have bad days but nevertheless god has
[53:53] always been there
[53:55] and we know that satan is going to
[53:56] attack he's going to assault us each and
[53:58] every day but thanks be to god we have a
[54:00] savior
[54:02] we have a redeemer
[54:03] we have a healer
[54:05] we have a warrior god that fights for us
[54:11] what we find here the bible will tell us
[54:12] many are the afflictions of the
[54:14] righteous
[54:15] so don't think when you're being
[54:16] buffeted that you're the only one
[54:20] you're not the only one
[54:22] join the club
[54:25] but i tell you what
[54:26] what better club to be in
[54:30] when our captain is going before us
[54:34] the captain of the host of the lord
[54:36] who's never lost a battle who's never
[54:40] lost a subject who's never lost a
[54:43] believer
[54:45] oh church what better company amen
[54:50] many are the afflictions of the
[54:52] righteous but the lord capital l capital
[54:54] hold capital r capital d jehovah
[54:58] delivereth him out of them all that word
[55:00] affliction there means
[55:03] dysfunctional
[55:04] don't raise your hand
[55:08] because some of us come from
[55:09] dysfunctional families dysfunctional
[55:11] lives we got dysfunctional things that
[55:12] we have been through
[55:15] but we find the word affliction it means
[55:17] dysfunctional wrong evil wicked evil
[55:20] distress misery injury calamity bad
[55:23] unpleasant and evil giving pain
[55:25] unhappiness and misery
[55:28] and we find that from the scriptures man
[55:31] is of a few days
[55:32] and full of affliction
[55:35] full of misery full of heartache full of
[55:37] distress
[55:38] and then you know to cap it all off
[55:40] satan is there punching you
[55:43] man i'm painting a pretty picture arnold
[55:48] but god said when the enemy comes in
[55:51] no matter how he comes
[55:53] whether he comes in
[55:55] as a flood or whether he comes in at all
[55:59] god is raising the standard
[56:03] god has lifted the standard
[56:07] even like tabernacle we have been
[56:09] elevated not that this church is to be
[56:11] the model of all churches in the message
[56:13] but we're no longer on the back woods in
[56:15] the piney woods of louisiana back there
[56:18] where nobody could find us what god is
[56:20] doing in the natural he's also doing in
[56:22] the supernatural god is elevating a
[56:25] people god is elevating not just here in
[56:28] the flesh but also in the supernatural
[56:30] god is elevating a people that's going
[56:32] to attain to the word for this hour
[56:37] we're going to get there we're going to
[56:38] meet there not one of us not one promise
[56:41] is going to go unfulfilled
[56:43] not one promise of god is going to go
[56:45] unacclaimed by the children of god we
[56:48] are going to acclaim every promise
[56:50] because god has granted us he wouldn't
[56:53] tell us it if he wasn't there to provide
[56:55] it for us and if god has set the
[56:56] standard then god is going to make sure
[56:59] that he equips the people to achieve the
[57:01] standard
[57:05] verbatim would tell us this in gifts
[57:08] he said
[57:10] and just as i start to do something for
[57:12] god then expect all guns and he'll turn
[57:14] right on you
[57:16] all right so we got a new family at the
[57:18] church
[57:20] get ready
[57:23] god ain't gonna make it pleasant
[57:26] but he's brought you here to raise the
[57:28] standard
[57:31] so when you make your mind young person
[57:34] to serve god all guns in hell are going
[57:36] to be trained on you
[57:38] he says now i pray for me because and he
[57:40] says now pray for me because i need i
[57:42] realize that every time faith sets
[57:43] itself up the devil turns every gun and
[57:47] hell right on it like that you see so it
[57:49] makes it pretty hard
[57:53] man he's got iphones he's got widgets
[57:55] and gadgets man you say you're going to
[57:57] serve god you came to the altar and you
[57:59] got victory over and all of a sudden you
[58:01] go back the next day and you're all by
[58:03] yourself mama and i went to walmart to
[58:04] buy some groceries you pulled that
[58:06] little phone out and you don't found
[58:07] your little widget way to get in there
[58:09] and look up some bikinis and this that
[58:11] and the other
[58:13] all guns in hell are trained on you
[58:15] trained on you are you saying living
[58:18] what you're proclaiming
[58:21] and if you're not it's an easy fix
[58:24] it's called dying out
[58:27] he says now that's right he's a brother
[58:30] let me go back and go tell he said
[58:31] because the message is right because god
[58:33] sent the message because god sent the
[58:35] messenger no doubt that every gun in
[58:37] hell will be firing at him that's right
[58:40] he'll stumble
[58:42] and fall
[58:43] and get up and shake his head and go on
[58:46] so you may stumble tonight you may fall
[58:48] tonight but don't stay in the fallen
[58:50] condition
[58:51] get up shake your head and get back into
[58:53] the battle and know that god is on your
[58:56] side know that god is drawing you know
[58:58] that god is pulling you know that god
[59:00] wants more for you than just drifting
[59:02] through life and being a piece of
[59:03] driftwood hanging up on every little
[59:05] cooking corner that you can go by no god
[59:07] is calling you to be a real article a
[59:10] real son and daughter of god be a little
[59:13] voice in this hour if he said in the
[59:15] word or he said through a prophet that
[59:17] this bride is going to be the final
[59:18] voice to the final aid and somebody's
[59:21] got to raise up to be the voice and
[59:23] begin to speak what god's word declares
[59:26] that means that down with pornography
[59:28] down with fear down with anxiety down
[59:30] with depression down with anything
[59:32] that's unlike god and not with the word
[59:34] of god up with the supernatural i would
[59:36] just speaking in tongues off with the
[59:38] presence of god off with the dancing in
[59:40] the spirit off with the body change up

[1:00:15] brother johnny i used to love to fight
[1:00:18] but you know what god didn't take the
[1:00:19] fight out of me

[1:00:25] and he says here in the message
[1:00:26] testimony you got to fight for every
[1:00:29] inch of ground that you have
[1:00:31] every man in here
[1:00:33] that's born again of the spirit of god

[1:05:51] but god is faithful
[1:05:53] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:05:56] above
[1:05:57] that you're able to bear know that that
[1:06:00] you're able
[1:06:01] but
[1:06:02] will with the temptation also
[1:06:04] make a way of an escape
[1:06:06] that you may be able to bear see god
[1:06:08] doesn't
[1:06:09] leave you where you are
[1:06:12] god raises the standard against the
[1:06:13] enemy
[1:06:15] so that you're victorious and no matter
[1:06:17] what battlefront you're facing
[1:06:19] you're going to be victorious
[1:06:22] see we have a promise
[1:06:24] we have a promise that there's many
[1:06:26] temptations
[1:06:27] there's many afflictions
[1:06:29] but he will deliver out of them all
[1:06:33] we may go by the way of the grave but it
[1:06:35] does not mean that the enemy was
[1:06:36] victorious
[1:06:39] it means that god had another plan for
[1:06:40] your life
[1:06:42] god knows the number of days he knows
[1:06:44] the number of breasts you're going to
[1:06:46] take he knows the number of beats your
[1:06:47] heart is going to beat
[1:06:50] and god knows and he's equipped you to
[1:06:51] face every trial every battle every
[1:06:54] sickness everything you're going through
[1:06:56] god has equipped us in this hour what
[1:06:58] other age has had the most glorious
[1:07:00] message that we have today
[1:07:04] this is a translation message
[1:07:09] and god is about to translate sons and
[1:07:11] daughters of god
[1:07:13] he said christians sometimes in the
[1:07:15] messenger's redemption by judgment
[1:07:16] christians sometimes look down up
[1:07:18] they're looked down upon they fun up but
[1:07:20] we come as a warrior
[1:07:23] we come sprinkled in the blood the old
[1:07:25] rugged cross going before us the morning
[1:07:28] star
[1:07:29] lighting up the way why we're on the
[1:07:31] road somewhere don't care what the world
[1:07:33] says well it's what god said the field
[1:07:35] belongs to us god said so we're on the
[1:07:38] road if we get knocked out of the battle
[1:07:40] here at this earthly earthly tabernacle
[1:07:42] is gone we got another one already
[1:07:44] waiting there's nothing to be scared
[1:07:46] about and we find in romans 8 and verse
[1:07:49] 31 says what shall we say to these
[1:07:51] things if god be for us who can be
[1:07:54] against us oh let when you wake up in
[1:07:57] the morning won't you quote that
[1:07:58] scripture to the devil if you're against
[1:08:00] me this wonder why do i care because god
[1:08:02] is for me this morning god is my help
[1:08:05] god is my hope god is my state he that
[1:08:07] spared not his own son but delivered him
[1:08:09] up for us all how shall he not also with
[1:08:12] him freely give us all things who shall
[1:08:14] lay anything to the charge of god's
[1:08:16] elect it is god that justifies who is it
[1:08:19] that condemned it it is christ that die
[1:08:20] day rather that has risen again who is
[1:08:23] even at the right hand of god who also
[1:08:25] maketh intercession for us
[1:08:28] and my probably one of my favorite
[1:08:29] scriptures who shall separate us
[1:08:32] who
[1:08:33] what
[1:08:34] what trial
[1:08:37] what spirit what demon possession or
[1:08:39] oppression
[1:08:40] no matter what you're going through who
[1:08:42] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:08:44] love of god
[1:08:46] shall tribulation
[1:08:48] shall tribulation
[1:08:51] shall distress
[1:08:52] persecution
[1:08:54] famine
[1:08:55] nakedness peril sword
[1:08:58] as it is written for thy sake
[1:09:01] we are killed that word killed there
[1:09:03] means we're exposed to death we endure
[1:09:07] sufferings equivalent to dying
[1:09:10] every
[1:09:11] day
[1:09:13] all the day long we are accounted as
[1:09:15] sheep for the slaughter but nay in all
[1:09:17] things we are more than conquerors
[1:09:19] through him that loved us for i am
[1:09:20] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:09:23] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:09:25] nor present things present no things to
[1:09:27] come nor height nor death nor any
[1:09:29] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:09:31] from the love of god which is in christ
[1:09:33] jesus
[1:09:35] though we are exposed to death though we
[1:09:37] endure sufferings of equivalent that are
[1:09:39] equivalent to dying yet you're more than
[1:09:41] a conqueror
[1:09:43] i said you're more than a conqueror
[1:09:45] you look in the mirror when you get up
[1:09:47] and you see a frail body you see a
[1:09:49] battle-scarred weary soul
[1:09:52] but god sees more than a conqueror
[1:09:55] because he's a mighty warrior
[1:09:57] god sees somebody that he's implanted
[1:09:59] his seed in
[1:10:01] and no matter what they face who they
[1:10:03] face when they face how they face they
[1:10:06] are going to be victorious
[1:10:09] that's what god sees
[1:10:12] so the battle may rage
[1:10:15] but church you'll not be defeated
[1:10:18] nothing can separate us from his love no
[1:10:20] nothing can separate us from his mercies
[1:10:22] and nothing can separate us from his
[1:10:24] presence
[1:10:26] there is not one thing that you face
[1:10:28] that the enemy can separate you from our
[1:10:30] god
[1:10:32] and god
[1:10:33] every time that enemy comes in he raises
[1:10:36] a standard
[1:10:38] and he raises it in you
[1:10:40] to meet the challenge of the hour
[1:10:44] he raises your faith another notch
[1:10:48] to do it to combat the enemy that you're
[1:10:50] facing
[1:10:51] he done it with the pale horse the red
[1:10:53] horse the white horse and the black
[1:10:55] horse every time one of those spirits
[1:10:57] came what did he do he raised a standard
[1:11:01] he had something not equivalent but more
[1:11:05] power more word more anointing more
[1:11:08] power the presence of the lord to combat
[1:11:11] that spirit
[1:11:13] and god has not ceased to be god today
[1:11:16] he's still the same
[1:11:17] and i love what brother man says he goes
[1:11:19] oh the glorious part every once in a
[1:11:20] while he'll give us a bunch of grapes
[1:11:23] a big bunch of grapes
[1:11:25] so that we can have evidence that there
[1:11:26] is a land beyond the river
[1:11:29] let me bring this to a close or start
[1:11:31] trying to bring it to a close
[1:11:34] we find that in the greatest battle ever
[1:11:36] fought and i know this is a message that
[1:11:37] we know all too well but he said there
[1:11:39] had to be a mutual meeting place and the
[1:11:41] mind was the battleground was a place
[1:11:42] that was chosen because that's where the
[1:11:44] decisions are made that's where satan
[1:11:46] meets you and decisions are made there
[1:11:47] because god made man that way he said
[1:11:49] the ma the mind accepts the life which
[1:11:52] is the word of god and there brings that
[1:11:55] life see just your thoughts don't do it
[1:11:57] so you can't just imagine yourself or
[1:11:59] think yourself and try to have mind over
[1:12:01] matter but no your mind accepts it and
[1:12:04] then it grabs hold of it and then it
[1:12:06] brings it down into your soul or to your
[1:12:08] heart and then that's where life is
[1:12:10] given
[1:12:12] so it's got to come from the mind down
[1:12:14] to the heart or into the soul but he
[1:12:17] said see the mind accepts the life which
[1:12:19] is the word of god and there brings the
[1:12:20] life just your thoughts don't do it see
[1:12:23] but the word of god brought in the
[1:12:24] channel of your thought it's not the
[1:12:26] thought it's christian science make its
[1:12:28] mind over matter but your mind accepts
[1:12:30] it it grasps it what is your mind
[1:12:32] controlled by your spirit and your
[1:12:34] spirit catches the word of god and
[1:12:36] that's the thing that's got life in it
[1:12:38] and it brings life into you
[1:12:41] so when you hear the word go forth
[1:12:44] you're not just receiving it with your
[1:12:46] mind though it comes through the channel
[1:12:47] of your mind but your spirit catches it
[1:12:50] and it brings that life it brings that
[1:12:52] anointing it brings that word into you
[1:12:54] and what does it do it equips you
[1:12:56] for the battle
[1:12:59] see
[1:13:00] he says now if you abide in me in my
[1:13:02] word and you then ask what you will
[1:13:03] because you
[1:13:04] in the word are the same that's right
[1:13:08] so when god is elevating the standard
[1:13:11] he's elevating you
[1:13:13] because you are the word
[1:13:15] essentially
[1:13:16] even like tabernacle and those that are
[1:13:18] on stream those that are real born again
[1:13:21] sons and daughters of god you have
[1:13:22] become the word in flesh
[1:13:25] and god has lifted that standard up
[1:13:29] god has lifted that standard up and god
[1:13:32] has put it on display
[1:13:34] he is not afraid to back up his word
[1:13:37] and he's not afraid to back up his word
[1:13:40] in you
[1:13:41] to make this word live and flow from
[1:13:43] your life
[1:13:44] however whenever whoever he wants it to
[1:13:49] god is not ashamed of our services
[1:13:51] he's not ashamed of the outpouring of
[1:13:53] the spirit when sons and daughters begin
[1:13:55] to get emotional and i just listened to
[1:13:56] a tape this morning and brother brown
[1:13:58] said i like emotion i'm i'm i i'm
[1:14:01] paraphrased but i'm heavy on the side of
[1:14:03] emotion so all those that don't believe
[1:14:05] that the prophet of god was emotional
[1:14:07] you need to go back and listen to the
[1:14:08] tapes
[1:14:09] because that was from the message it
[1:14:11] wasn't so from the beginning 1958 you'll
[1:14:13] find that the prophet of god enjoyed
[1:14:15] emotion he enjoyed service he enjoyed
[1:14:17] the worship god and the reciprocation of
[1:14:20] the spirit coming back to say amen to
[1:14:22] the worship yes sir
[1:14:25] so we find now if you abide in me in my
[1:14:27] word which you become the word the word
[1:14:29] and you're the same he has preeminence
[1:14:31] he's got the ruler shipping and you
[1:14:32] become his prisoner he says so from the
[1:14:34] middle of the heart which is the soul
[1:14:36] from there goes forth feeding every
[1:14:38] channel the trouble of it is we're
[1:14:40] standing in a lot of doubt
[1:14:42] sometimes you know you want to believe
[1:14:44] but there's so much doubt just there
[1:14:46] but he says you got to blow out all the
[1:14:48] flu you got to clean it all out so that
[1:14:50] the word can drop down
[1:14:53] otherwise if you don't clean those flues
[1:14:54] out you're going to blow up
[1:14:56] and you find people get off oh they
[1:14:58] serve the lord 20 years but all of a
[1:14:59] sudden now they don't believe anymore
[1:15:01] because they had flus in there they
[1:15:02] didn't clean up they didn't blow out
[1:15:05] they had little doubts that were
[1:15:06] unsettled
[1:15:07] little things that just kept you know
[1:15:09] they kept pushing it down pushing it
[1:15:10] down pushing it trying to believe
[1:15:13] wanting to believe oh it makes regional
[1:15:15] rational sense to believe that this is
[1:15:17] the truth message but unless it becomes
[1:15:19] from the mind to the heart and you don't
[1:15:22] clean that thing out so that it becomes
[1:15:24] a reality and the life that's anoint
[1:15:27] that's in that word but comes from your
[1:15:29] mind and dropped down into that art and
[1:15:30] produces that same life in you you're
[1:15:33] going to blow up
[1:15:36] so it's got to be accepted in the mind
[1:15:38] believed in the heart then the word of
[1:15:39] god becomes a reality then every sense
[1:15:41] of the soul body is just scoured out
[1:15:43] with the holy spirit then your senses of
[1:15:45] god your conscience of god everything
[1:15:46] that's godly flows to you there's no
[1:15:49] doubt anywhere he says there's nothing
[1:15:53] can rise up
[1:15:55] if you're here this evening and there's
[1:15:57] doubts in your life
[1:16:00] know that the battleground is there it
[1:16:02] was drawn you had no choice in the
[1:16:04] matter god chose the battleground
[1:16:08] but he's also equipped you to receive
[1:16:10] life in the midst of your battle
[1:16:13] and how do you receive it faith cometh
[1:16:15] by hearing
[1:16:16] hearing by the word of god
[1:16:18] don't allow yourself to drift off in la
[1:16:20] la land
[1:16:21] when the anointing in the presence of
[1:16:23] the lord is here to do what to say grab
[1:16:25] hold of that word because in that word
[1:16:28] has life
[1:16:30] eternal life changing body changing life
[1:16:36] to change transform you from an earthly
[1:16:39] tabernacle to an eternal tabernacle
[1:16:42] he says now as i begin to try to sorry i
[1:16:45] just got so much hail on my fork this
[1:16:47] morning or this evening rather he says
[1:16:49] but if that channel has been cleared out
[1:16:51] and been purged and been filled inside
[1:16:53] with the holy spirit
[1:16:55] that don't even come into the memories
[1:16:56] talking about miss doe miss john doe you
[1:16:58] know she tried this and she tried that
[1:17:00] and she failed he says that don't even
[1:17:02] come into memory no matter who miss
[1:17:04] jones or about miss jones what she did
[1:17:06] it's you and god together and nobody
[1:17:09] else but you too there you are there's
[1:17:12] your battle
[1:17:13] kill him at the beginning
[1:17:17] some of you like to pacify your devil
[1:17:21] here i got a pacifier sticking in his
[1:17:23] mouth i'll tote him around he'll go
[1:17:24] everywhere i go long as he hushes up
[1:17:27] no he said kill him at the beginning
[1:17:30] stop him dead in his track
[1:17:33] he says it ain't how long you make the
[1:17:35] war linger it stop it right now
[1:17:38] and if you're being persecuted you're
[1:17:40] being pressured and that little nagging
[1:17:42] death will follow you to church i'll
[1:17:44] tell you tonight stop it right now kill
[1:17:47] him in this service tonight don't walk
[1:17:50] out and think oh i'm going to be a
[1:17:51] better christian tomorrow and you hadn't
[1:17:53] dealt with your devil deal with your
[1:17:55] devil in the presence of the anointing
[1:17:57] of the holy spirit and let god fight
[1:17:59] your battle let god destroy your enemy
[1:18:02] let god put all those close up vengeance
[1:18:04] and let god pour out wrath on that
[1:18:06] adversary that's trying to take you down
[1:18:12] so no matter if ten thousand down this
[1:18:15] side today
[1:18:16] he says we're trusting ten thousand down
[1:18:18] that side tomorrow we're trusting that
[1:18:20] has nothing to do with me i'm the
[1:18:22] individual i'm the one that's trusting
[1:18:24] i'm the one that believes but the devil
[1:18:26] will try to come back right
[1:18:28] and get you there at all see he's got
[1:18:31] your army if he gets back if he comes
[1:18:33] back and he says if he can get in there
[1:18:35] then he's got your army routed
[1:18:38] so if your seed tastes male feeling here
[1:18:40] doesn't line up with the word he said
[1:18:41] put it aside remember your imagination
[1:18:44] conscious affections those things don't
[1:18:46] line up to the word put those things
[1:18:47] aside
[1:18:49] see but when god can get a man in his
[1:18:51] hands until he gets all the senses
[1:18:53] conscious everything cleaned out until
[1:18:55] it stands with god behind it in the
[1:18:58] spirit there's not a devil in the world
[1:19:00] can poke a doubt in there then
[1:19:02] and that's what our that's what we
[1:19:04] preach
[1:19:05] at this church that's what we preach we
[1:19:07] aspire to preach don't let doubt come
[1:19:08] and rob you
[1:19:10] don't let complexes come and rob you
[1:19:11] don't let fear come and rob you don't
[1:19:13] let the devil in any kind of method any
[1:19:15] kind of trick or trickery that it comes
[1:19:17] with don't let them rob you you're in a
[1:19:19] battle but god has equipped you for the
[1:19:21] battle
[1:19:23] god has equipped you for the battle
[1:19:25] see there's your battleground your
[1:19:26] battleground is back here at the
[1:19:28] beginning back here in the soul back in
[1:19:29] your mind that opens the mind is a gate
[1:19:32] to the soul the gate to the spirit
[1:19:33] rather your mind opens up and accepts
[1:19:36] the spirit or rejects the spirit so it's
[1:19:38] your mind that opens up the door or
[1:19:40] closes the door
[1:19:42] see but when your mind closes itself to
[1:19:44] those things and let god the spirit of
[1:19:46] his word come in it blows the rest of
[1:19:48] the stuff out every doubt is gone every
[1:19:50] fear is gone every sensation of doubt is
[1:19:52] gone every feeling is gone there's
[1:19:55] nothing standing there but the word of
[1:19:57] god and satan cannot battle against it
[1:20:02] no sir he can't battle against it now
[1:20:06] he says now know that that's the truth
[1:20:10] so you got to say like brother banham
[1:20:12] says start doubting your doubts
[1:20:15] sometimes we find that hard but start
[1:20:16] doubting your doubts
[1:20:18] as we bring this to a close here and i
[1:20:20] want to get to a certain part
[1:20:29] he says we fight
[1:20:31] in the message victory day
[1:20:33] we fight it every day every christian
[1:20:35] fights a battle every day we're in a
[1:20:36] warfare right now going on constantly
[1:20:39] within us
[1:20:41] how many can testify to that
[1:20:44] between right and wrong shall we receive
[1:20:46] it
[1:20:47] what shall we do these are some of the
[1:20:49] battles shall we receive it what shall
[1:20:51] we do shall we bow to the world shall we
[1:20:53] give up
[1:20:54] to this thought that we got
[1:20:58] he goes now you got to focus it take it
[1:21:01] from genesis to revelation
[1:21:03] she is thus saith the lord each time
[1:21:06] right down through there
[1:21:08] he says we can't give it up we can't
[1:21:11] compromise with the rest of them
[1:21:14] he said we just we can't do it we got to
[1:21:17] stay here that's all no matter how great
[1:21:19] the enemy is how much machinery he's got
[1:21:22] against us how many organizations how
[1:21:24] many of this or any of the other he says
[1:21:27] we yet we have pulled the focus of god's
[1:21:29] word till we find that it's the one
[1:21:31] thing and that's the blood of jesus
[1:21:33] christ and he is the same yesterday
[1:21:36] today
[1:21:37] and forever
[1:21:40] so if you're in a battle tonight
[1:21:42] and you're losing focus
[1:21:44] that's why you come to the presence of
[1:21:46] the lord to refocus
[1:21:49] so that you can focus back on that his
[1:21:51] blood is still effectual
[1:21:54] and it's efficacious and it endures
[1:21:57] and it's lasting
[1:21:59] and he said the captain
[1:22:02] the captain give an order and you turn
[1:22:04] around and do something backwards why
[1:22:06] you'll mess the whole army up that's
[1:22:08] right
[1:22:09] you'll throw it right into a riot
[1:22:11] you've got to carry out the orders
[1:22:14] the only way you can do it is to focus
[1:22:16] it
[1:22:17] and see the purpose what it's all about
[1:22:20] we've had many great battles spiritual
[1:22:22] battles many great v-days that the
[1:22:26] church has made or has i mean the church
[1:22:28] the body of christ i'm not talking about
[1:22:30] the organization's systems now because
[1:22:32] i'm talking about the body of christ the
[1:22:34] body of believers down through the ages
[1:22:36] has had many great v-days
[1:22:41] so you have to carry out the orders
[1:22:45] you can't get the orders well i don't
[1:22:47] like them
[1:22:48] well tough luck
[1:22:51] you're not the captain
[1:22:53] you're the little peon
[1:22:56] little private that enlisted
[1:22:59] so you got to carry out the orders do
[1:23:02] what he says because he knows what's
[1:23:04] best for you
[1:23:06] that captain has reared himself he's
[1:23:08] going through the ranks he understands
[1:23:11] what it takes to keep his man safe
[1:23:15] as i was talking to one of the men one
[1:23:17] of the marines that came here for
[1:23:19] nathan's funeral and he's a high ranking
[1:23:22] captain now and
[1:23:23] and i was asking him you know kind of
[1:23:25] what they went through in the war that
[1:23:27] they faced when they all went in and he
[1:23:29] said our number one responsibility and
[1:23:31] what gives us so much grief and keeps us
[1:23:33] up at night and causes ptsd
[1:23:36] it's not
[1:23:38] it's not the people that we killed
[1:23:41] but it's the ones around us that were
[1:23:43] killed
[1:23:44] because their ultimate responsibility is
[1:23:47] the safety of their men
[1:23:49] and if they lose one
[1:23:51] that burden that pressure is on their
[1:23:54] shoulders because then there's a letter
[1:23:55] that goes to that family
[1:23:57] thank you for the service
[1:23:59] your son died in battle
[1:24:01] so they know the orders they know how to
[1:24:03] give the orders they know what it takes
[1:24:06] to be successful and to not only be
[1:24:08] successful and to accomplish the task
[1:24:11] but to save every life
[1:24:14] that's in the military or in that
[1:24:15] regiment
[1:24:17] so it's upon us church
[1:24:19] when you hear things being preached from
[1:24:21] the pulpit on sunday morning or
[1:24:23] wednesday night or whenever it may be a
[1:24:24] special meeting and the captain is
[1:24:26] giving orders
[1:24:28] well that's just their thought no that
[1:24:30] ain't just their thought
[1:24:32] that's the captain equipping you for
[1:24:34] battle
[1:24:35] so that you'll make it through laodicea
[1:24:38] what is he doing he's raising the
[1:24:40] standard
[1:24:42] and then he's not only raising it but
[1:24:44] he's giving you the equipment so that
[1:24:46] you're raised with it
[1:24:48] as i bring this to a close isaiah 59 and
[1:24:51] verse 17 he put on righteousness as the
[1:24:53] breastplate the helmet of salvation upon
[1:24:54] his head
[1:24:56] garments of vengeance for clothing it
[1:24:58] was clothed with seal as a cloak
[1:25:00] according to their deeds accordingly he
[1:25:02] will repay fury to his adversaries
[1:25:05] recompense to his enemies to the islands
[1:25:07] he will repay recompense
[1:25:09] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[1:25:11] from the west and his glory shall from
[1:25:14] the rising of the sun when the enemy
[1:25:16] shall come in like a flood the spirit of
[1:25:19] the lord shall lift up a standard
[1:25:22] against him
[1:25:23] that word standard there it means so
[1:25:27] many things
[1:25:28] a lot of people want to you know they
[1:25:30] got so many ways but since they're not
[1:25:32] here preaching to you tonight and i am
[1:25:35] i'm going to look at it from the aspect
[1:25:37] of a standard
[1:25:39] is a flag that hangs on a pole
[1:25:42] oh man
[1:25:43] that's just simple i thought it was
[1:25:45] going to be something just supernatural
[1:25:48] the standard god's raising up a flag
[1:25:51] not just a flag
[1:25:54] see the standard is
[1:25:57] the bible would tell us that it's a flag
[1:25:59] on a pole it's a standard it's an inside
[1:26:01] it's a banner
[1:26:03] and there are many times that the enemy
[1:26:04] comes in
[1:26:07] and every time he comes god raises the
[1:26:09] flag
[1:26:10] what does he raise the flag for
[1:26:13] so that when you're in the midst
[1:26:16] of a hail storm of bullets coming your
[1:26:17] way
[1:26:19] you can see that he's still going before
[1:26:20] you
[1:26:22] the standard
[1:26:24] has been lifted
[1:26:26] the standard is still waving
[1:26:29] oh they thought when 1965 when the
[1:26:32] prophet of god went off the scene maybe
[1:26:34] the standard of fallen
[1:26:37] but if you do any kind of study of civil
[1:26:40] war
[1:26:41] that flag
[1:26:43] to that regiment
[1:26:44] was the identity of the regiment
[1:26:48] those flags symbolize more than just
[1:26:51] some cloth and a pole
[1:26:53] but no
[1:26:54] it meant so much more let me just kind
[1:26:56] of kind of go through and show you what
[1:26:58] when that flag there
[1:27:00] it meant the colors it helped the
[1:27:02] soldiers identify
[1:27:04] their troop in battle
[1:27:07] maybe there's a bunch of smoke all
[1:27:09] around but yet when they see that flag
[1:27:11] lifted up they see that's where my men
[1:27:13] are and they can rejoin
[1:27:15] their troop
[1:27:17] see the color bear
[1:27:18] or color bearers or the standard bears
[1:27:21] what did they do they
[1:27:22] they set the pace of the march
[1:27:25] otherwise they set the tone for church
[1:27:30] and you think it's all on brother mike
[1:27:32] brother timothy
[1:27:35] no
[1:27:36] you're the standard bear we're setting
[1:27:38] the tone
[1:27:40] for how we worship it even like
[1:27:41] tabernacle
[1:27:44] so they set the cadence they set the
[1:27:46] proper length
[1:27:47] the color bearers they didn't carry a
[1:27:49] weapon
[1:27:52] no and it increased their likelihood of
[1:27:54] being killed
[1:27:55] see
[1:27:56] these soldiers were chosen for their
[1:27:58] bravery and their steadiness
[1:28:02] they were chosen
[1:28:05] hand-picked by the captain because of
[1:28:07] their bravery
[1:28:08] god or the captain looked in and said
[1:28:10] that's who i want
[1:28:12] because i know when the battle's going
[1:28:14] there's no retreat
[1:28:16] whether they have a gun or not
[1:28:18] they're holding the standard
[1:28:21] they're holding the standard
[1:28:24] there's a story about a sergeant i
[1:28:26] believe it was um let me go and i'll
[1:28:28] find it for you real quick it's a battle
[1:28:30] here
[1:28:31] it's called cutler's brigade of land uh
[1:28:34] the 147th new york was among some of the
[1:28:36] first union infantry regiments to arrive
[1:28:39] near the mcpherson farm and i'm sure
[1:28:41] brother ross and brother aaron is going
[1:28:42] to correct me on this and that's quite
[1:28:44] all right but there's 380 new yorkers
[1:28:46] across the chambersburg pike and they
[1:28:49] formed up near the bed of the unfinished
[1:28:51] railroad cut
[1:28:52] and we find that these regiments with
[1:28:54] two other sister regiments engaged in
[1:28:56] sharp a sharp fire fight with the
[1:28:59] confederate army and the 155th north
[1:29:02] carolina worked its way around the right
[1:29:04] flank of the union line and they poured
[1:29:06] in a murderous fire
[1:29:08] orders were sent forward directing the
[1:29:10] troops to fall back to more secure
[1:29:12] positions but the commander of the 147th
[1:29:15] was severely wounded before they could
[1:29:17] transmit the command to his men and as a
[1:29:20] result as a result the new yorkers stood
[1:29:22] alone against three confederate
[1:29:24] regiments
[1:29:26] and the fight was fierce and hot the
[1:29:28] boys were falling like autumn leaves the
[1:29:30] air was full of lead after half an hour
[1:29:32] of this unequal conquest the courier
[1:29:36] rode in as a male storm and or maelstrom
[1:29:39] and he delivered the retreat order and
[1:29:41] color sergeant john hencliffe who was a
[1:29:44] very uh distinguished soldier he
[1:29:46] attempted to escape with the flag and he
[1:29:48] was struck by several bullets and he was
[1:29:50] he was killed instantly
[1:29:52] and sergeant william wiborn
[1:29:56] rushed back and he pulled the
[1:29:57] blood-soaked standard from underneath
[1:30:00] hindi's
[1:30:02] lifeless body
[1:30:04] he could have let us lay there
[1:30:09] he could just let us help man we're
[1:30:10] going to retreat i'm getting out of here
[1:30:12] before i'm next but no he ran to the
[1:30:14] lifeless soldier picked up the standard
[1:30:17] and raised it again
[1:30:21] and they would go on to say he said now
[1:30:23] lieutenant pierce narrated the
[1:30:25] remarkable remarkable conclusion
[1:30:28] conclusion of the incident i climbed up
[1:30:30] to the rocky face of the cut on the
[1:30:32] south side i made my way with many of
[1:30:34] our men across the metal between the
[1:30:36] railroad cut and chambers chambersburg's
[1:30:39] pike and i crossed the pike into a small
[1:30:41] peach orchard and i overtook the colors
[1:30:43] in the hand of sergeant william
[1:30:46] wyburn just as i joined him to he
[1:30:49] received a shot and they fell on the
[1:30:50] colors as if dead and i tried to remove
[1:30:53] the colors but he held on them with the
[1:30:56] true irish script
[1:30:59] and i commanded him let go
[1:31:01] and to my surprise he answered
[1:31:04] hold on i'll be up in a minute
[1:31:10] said he staggered to his feet and he
[1:31:12] carried them through the fight
[1:31:14] and he was commissioned for his courage
[1:31:17] and i will say this to even like
[1:31:19] tabernacle to the pruitt family to the
[1:31:21] butts family and to those that are
[1:31:24] listening on the internet tonight
[1:31:26] sergeant weibo rose to his feet and he
[1:31:29] lifted the standard once again and what
[1:31:31] did it do it rallied the troops so they
[1:31:33] made it through the battle and i'm here
[1:31:35] to tell you even like tabernacle may
[1:31:37] have suffered a blow but they're sons
[1:31:40] and daughters of god holding on to that
[1:31:42] standard hold on a minute
[1:31:45] i'll be back up in a minute we may have
[1:31:48] taken a blow but their standard has been
[1:31:51] raised even like tabernacle all those
[1:31:54] died in faith but we're still believing
[1:31:57] we're still trusting god we're still
[1:31:59] waving that banner that god has a people
[1:32:02] god has a word god has healing god has
[1:32:06] deliverance god has a supernatural god
[1:32:08] has the anointing god has a presence god
[1:32:11] has speaking in tongues god is dancing
[1:32:14] in the spirit god has the standard has
[1:32:17] been lifted and you are that standard i
[1:32:21] say arise people and claim that promise
[1:32:24] god thank you for the call in this hour
[1:32:27] thank you for raising the sanders thank
[1:32:29] you for calling me into the battle thank
[1:32:31] you lord you saw me under attack you saw
[1:32:34] the foolish that i hit you saw it lord
[1:32:37] but i'm in a razor standard once again
[1:32:40] even like we're not backing up we're not
[1:32:43] giving in we're not bowing to the devil
[1:32:45] we're pressing the battle we're marching
[1:32:48] forward we're trusting god
[1:32:50] musicians come
[1:32:57] the standard
[1:32:59] has been lifted
[1:33:01] the life of
[1:33:02] mary karen pruitt was nothing short
[1:33:05] of a life of christ being lifted up in
[1:33:09] this hour proving
[1:33:10] that god
[1:33:12] will have somebody that will believe the
[1:33:14] word
[1:33:16] no matter what the opposition
[1:33:19] no matter
[1:33:20] what they face
[1:33:22] no matter the difficulty
[1:33:24] her life proves
[1:33:26] that god will have a virtuous daughter
[1:33:30] she never wavered in her sickness
[1:33:33] never recanted in her devotion to serve
[1:33:35] god no matter how bad the condition
[1:33:38] never
[1:33:39] faulted in her faith
[1:33:42] she died in faith
[1:33:44] and that faith proved to be her victory
[1:33:49] a standard
[1:33:50] being waived
[1:33:52] over laodicea
[1:33:54] what you thought
[1:33:56] to bring evil
[1:33:57] god turned it for her coronation day
[1:34:01] what you thought satan to knock her down
[1:34:04] and she was knocked down
[1:34:06] but now the rest of us
[1:34:08] have picked the standard up
[1:34:10] and we're raising the standard
[1:34:14] what about the pruitt butts family
[1:34:17] what we've seen in their life as i
[1:34:19] marveled at brother tim and i told him
[1:34:20] on countless occasions
[1:34:22] what we have seen from you
[1:34:24] is nothing short of a display of true
[1:34:26] faith
[1:34:27] true grit in the face
[1:34:29] of the enemy breathing down your neck
[1:34:32] his threatening lies threatening to take
[1:34:34] your wife
[1:34:35] you steady
[1:34:36] and you can continually preach divine
[1:34:39] healing
[1:34:40] preach deliverance
[1:34:43] never showed
[1:34:44] weakness
[1:34:46] in the face of the church in the face of
[1:34:48] the the enemy but he showed the result
[1:34:51] what was he doing raising a standard
[1:34:54] even a light
[1:34:55] so when you face your enemy when you
[1:34:58] face your adversary you don't have to
[1:35:00] shed a tear
[1:35:01] but you can face him with true grit
[1:35:04] true faith
[1:35:05] true resolve
[1:35:07] that your god is going to see you
[1:35:10] through every battle
[1:35:12] a husband a pastor proclaiming god's
[1:35:14] eternal word you can just play something
[1:35:19] the eternal word that god heals
[1:35:21] whether it be on this side or whether it
[1:35:23] be on beyond the curtain of time
[1:35:26] god is still the healer
[1:35:29] what has been
[1:35:30] displayed here at even light tabernacle
[1:35:34] is a standard has been lifted the word
[1:35:36] of god
[1:35:38] in the pruitt family
[1:35:40] and now even light is time for us to
[1:35:43] measure up
[1:35:43] [Music]
[1:35:45] in the face of adversity
[1:35:47] losing a mom
[1:35:49] losing a wife
[1:35:51] losing a friend
[1:35:54] never waver never falten never saying
[1:35:56] why me
[1:35:59] the standard
[1:36:00] has been lifted i'm not saying that
[1:36:02] karen pruitt's a standard of the message
[1:36:04] but though she is
[1:36:06] because that's what the message produces
[1:36:08] i'm not saying tim pruitt in the pruitt
[1:36:11] family is a standard we all got to live
[1:36:13] by but yet it's been displayed so it
[1:36:15] gives you something to live by
[1:36:17] to measure up too
[1:36:19] sees no matter how hot the battle
[1:36:21] becomes no matter how dark the situation
[1:36:24] remain positive
[1:36:26] hold to the promise
[1:36:28] because we never know when that eagle
[1:36:29] anointing is going to turn our way and
[1:36:30] deliverance will be our promise
[1:36:34] so what we have seen is true faith
[1:36:36] true leadership true love and true
[1:36:38] christianity
[1:36:40] being displayed in man's darkest hour
[1:36:44] the standard
[1:36:45] [Music]
[1:36:47] the standard
[1:36:49] the standard has been lifted
[1:36:54] and now
[1:36:55] we got to achieve
[1:36:58] let me finish with these
[1:36:59] last couple quotes he said when the
[1:37:02] enemy comes in like a flood
[1:37:04] as is coming today
[1:37:06] what did god say he'd do he said the
[1:37:09] spirit of god would raise up a standard
[1:37:11] against it
[1:37:13] and he says are you one of them
[1:37:17] so he's showing that you believer are
[1:37:20] the standard by which he's raising up in
[1:37:22] this hour
[1:37:24] and the message
[1:37:25] to take on the whole armor of god he
[1:37:26] said when enemy comes in like a flood
[1:37:28] the whole he said the spirit of god
[1:37:30] raises a standard against it what does
[1:37:32] he do he makes the word that he's
[1:37:35] already said more positive
[1:37:39] taking his same word and just making it
[1:37:43] more
[1:37:44] positive
[1:37:46] see the word of god will raise up a
[1:37:47] standard the word would be more
[1:37:49] manifested and more manifested
[1:37:54] and from that time he says
[1:37:56] and as the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:37:58] the spirit of god raises a standard
[1:38:00] against it greater
[1:38:02] and greater and greater building up now
[1:38:05] it's right down to this last thing what
[1:38:08] i was talking about last night oh i
[1:38:10] believe that he will come i believe that
[1:38:12] these old frail bodies of ours will be
[1:38:14] changed
[1:38:15] and made like unto his own
[1:38:17] glorious body
[1:38:19] so you may be in a battle today
[1:38:23] you may be staring at the enemy face to
[1:38:25] face standing toe to toe and you may be
[1:38:27] wondering how am i going to make it
[1:38:30] can i make it will i make it
[1:38:33] will i survive
[1:38:35] let me encourage you
[1:38:37] when the enemy comes in he threatens you
[1:38:40] as a ravenous raging stream full of hate
[1:38:43] and venom and
[1:38:44] things
[1:38:46] god's gonna make that word in your life
[1:38:47] more positive
[1:38:50] and greater is he that is in you
[1:38:52] than he
[1:38:53] that is in that flood
[1:38:56] greater is he that is in you
[1:38:59] than he that is in that attack
[1:39:02] that is in that sickness that is in that
[1:39:04] fear that is in that anxiety that is in
[1:39:07] that depression greater is he
[1:39:11] he is in you
[1:39:12] and he has elevated that standard
[1:39:16] god bless you church
