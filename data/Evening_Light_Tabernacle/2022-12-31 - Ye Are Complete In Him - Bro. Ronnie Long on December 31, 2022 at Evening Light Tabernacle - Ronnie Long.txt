that's our desire not to stop short but to enter in Amen to go all the way when you come this far to turn back now but we're going all the way amen we serving all the way God he's not on a part-time or just some of the time but he's all the time we're thankful that we have a real and living God that we're not just wondering if he's out there afar off somewhere we don't pack him in our arm but he packs us amen and he said he'd meet us wherever We Gather in his name and I believe we've done that tonight amen I believe we've set aside our time in our lives we could be out doing who knows what tonight but we've said all that aside to come and that God might commune with us amen there's a Divine appointment tonight I believe in he's orchestrated it amen hallelujah might seem a little bit odd but if you just put your hand on the person next to you and I believe there's faith on the other end of that hand as we approach the father they would just ask if there's a need on the on the person next to you maybe you know maybe you don't you go ahead and pray for that need tonight father we thank you Lord oh your grace is sufficient for us father we thank you for this this time you've allotted us tonight oh god father we could come not out of vain repetition but father we could come expecting a new beginning from you oh god father as we answer into this last service of this year father we ask that you would come and have preeminence in this building tonight oh god father for each and every member in this assembly tonight father the visitors in our midst I pray Lord that that hand reached out by faith right now touching them Lord would have a supernatural effect on their life tonight oh God I pray that everyone that stepped foot in this building tonight would leave a better person father May there be feelings may there be healing so God father may you open up a heart that's hardened and turned Stony father may you make it a soft round tonight I pray oh god father we preach Liberation tonight amongst your people father we want freedom tonight amongst your people father we want your spirit to raise Supreme father I would ask that if there'd be any critical spirit in the building tonight that's your holy ghost power would drive it forth oh god father may you have preeminence to speak to your people as you've ordained it tonight oh god father I pray that you bring healing in your wings as we as we look upon your word just now in the mighty name of Jesus Christ amen amen Hallelujah sure thank you for the opportunity for the Tim it's such a personally you've been a great privilege to my family and your ministry and we just thank God that there's still men that'll fight for the message amen if you have your Bible to turn in the book of Colossians the second chapter in the first verse for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all Riches of the full Assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of the father and of Christ in whom are hit all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge and this I say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words for though I'd be absent in the flesh yet am I with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ as ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain to seed after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power amen may God bless his word tonight uh just for our time here tonight you may be seated we want to talk about ye are complete in him amen I I know this is our last service of the year and uh we probably didn't start out the year thinking you were going to hear me for your last service but here we are but I believe God has it in order amen I believe all the trials that we went through to this last year and all the disappointments and all the all the turns that we didn't see coming and all the what we might have thought were mistakes or pitfalls I believe God ordered those I believe our footsteps are ordered of the Lord and it's not just that we're we're turning a new page uh necessarily in our physical sense but I believe his brother Timothy said last night that we're turning another chapter stepping into another realm than we've known before I believe as the bride of Christ we're looking at a New Horizon A A New Beginning where where men have not walked before I believe as the bride we're stepping into something that as brother Isaac preached last night it's our commission to fulfill something it's our commission to do something in this hour it's it's not just our commission to sit on a Pew and enjoy a service a week here and a week there and struggle back and forth with the world and we're hot one day and we're cold one day that's not our commission but our commission is to take another step that we might obtain a body change I believe there's not another age coming I believe we're in this last stage that we are stepping into a changing of even our mortal bodies I just as we reflect back over this year I'm sure we all could go back through and think about the trials and the my goodness how we've we've got we've got people that have moved across country and people that have moved from other continents and people just there seems to be a shaking going on and not just in the in in in the natural world out there with with Russia with with missiles every day and and the government's falling apart but there's a shaking going on because the bride is getting into position I believe it's because we I would say raise your hand say me I believe because me I am getting into position the world is shaking around me I believe that we make up that last few that are getting into line and when we get into line there's nothing holding back the Rapture of the church amen when she gets into her position I believe that's talking about me I believe that's talking about you so as we as we close out this old year let's not reflect back on the mistakes or or the trials or the sickness or the hurt but let's look ahead and see what God has at the new beginning what God has at this new horizon I'm excited to see what the Lord is doing in this coming year I believe it could be I'm not saying it is but could it be the year where we we are raptured home why not what are we waiting for are we waiting on anything else Brothers is there something I don't know about but I believe this this could be the year that we're all going home is that all right so let's just give the good a good stomping to the devil for our last service for the year maybe you had some hurts this year maybe you were sick or maybe you lost some loved ones maybe you're confused in your mind let's just give the devil a good stomping for our last service this year is that okay I don't think we should be we should be tender with them I don't think we should be afraid of him he's not your buddy he's not your pal he didn't treat you tenderly this last year but I think it's time to give the devil a good old stomp as we end this year I believe it's in it it's in us to do it you may you may think that he's he's ripped away parts of you that you'll never get back but you're complete in him it may feel sometimes like the devil's taking you and you got a complex there you gotta hurt there you know when you get injured you kind of favor that spot for a while and you feel that you got to cover it up but it's okay just to be free in the spirit of the lord it's okay to let that complex go and let that hurt go and just give the devil a good black eye before we end the year is that okay amen hallelujah we know that we're living in an age that that's been prophesied that there would be things fulfilled in this age we can go back through the book but I know this is a well-taught church but this is the age of the Overcomer that's what's prophesied for our age is that somebody is going to overcome I believe it's us somebody's going to take the book and eat it I believe it's uh somebody's going to fulfill all of the years of Prophecy that would make this message a prophetic word and fulfill it I believe it's us I believe we are the people of Prophecy of this message he was talking about us he's not talking about somebody else down the road he was preaching right to you in your Pew where you're at in your trial what you're going through he said you will overcome this age that you're in you will overcome the trial that you're in I've already seen it in a vision you'll have a mistake and you'll fall but you'll get back in line because I saw a Perfect Bride in the vision of God I believe we're walking in that Vision I I think we're all in one Accord tonight man it was just it was more than just a prophecy that came to to bring people around a man or to move people to Indiana or to move people to Arizona but it was such a prophetic word that there would be people that would come one day that would be the very fulfillment of what was seen not in a natural sense he didn't see it in the natural but in a super natural Realm I believe the prophet saw this church I believe that prophets saw a believer that was that was willing to stand for the word I wonder if there's anybody in here tonight I'm saying I'm willing to stand for the word maybe I didn't do that good of a job last year but this is a new year I say that you make a new declaration to say this coming year I will stand for the word no matter what may come I'll stand on the promise of God it's our commission this was more than just than just a a prophet came so that the pillar of fire could be captured over his head but I believe when the message came forward it struck more than just the lens of that photographer but I believe that light came and it struck the lens of Our Lives I believe it struck the lens of hearts that are yet to come and are coming in now I believe it struck my heart I was just a Sony uh Sinner and then when that voice came across it it shook more than a camera lens for me but it struck my life something cut across my life and I've never been the same since you know where that Pillar of Fire will do is it will show you your true colors I think we all want to know I believe uh you know you've been through we've been to a couple camps we've been to a at a couple altars and a couple counseling with some young people and it seems that the the biggest pressing pressing issue is people are scared they're an impersonator well that's my mission tonight if I don't do anything else is to let you know you're the real deal you're not impersonating anything but you're the real deal there's somebody that's going to fulfill it in the real way I believe it's us I believe this is the time I believe this is the season we're not impersonating anything we're the genuine article of what this message was written for we are the people of this message that's what we're manifesting we don't have to worry about impersonating but it was written about us I don't have to try to fit it like you said but I was made to fit this message I was made to just walk and step with it it was spoken over me already created in the mind of God I'm not having to worry about if I'm gonna make it it was spoken for me I'm already sent to it I'm already dressed that's why he came it shows us our colors Hallelujah Satan had has had his system at work again to get the people to misbelieve the word of God Satan's wrong way of worship so there's a wrong way to worship like Cain and like Balaam they're very religious Cain was religious he brought an altar made an altar and frankly Kane was more religious than Abel sure was he done more than the Lord for the Lord the neighbor ever did so let's just throw that complex out Cain did more for the Lord than than you ever did so don't worry about that but Abel come in the way of the word that's all he done more he built a great denomination he built a great thing a great Christian Heritage but you see he come in the wrong way it wasn't received for it was contrary to the word Balaam was just as religious as Moses he come with the same sacrifice the same Lambs the same clean animals and everything and pray to the same God and offered sacrifice to the same God that Moses did though he come in the wrong way it was contrary to the word like it was in Eden the word won't mix with modern Theory see you can't have modern Theory the word won't mix with it any modern Theory it can't have a theory and have the word okay you've got to have the word or the theory now which are you going to believe this is the prophet asking a question you can't have both you can't have your idea and the word you've got to have one or the other you can't have theoretically I like this pet Doctrine and I like the way that I can stay comfortable in my seat you can't have that and have the word at the same time so this is a choosing time that we're living in this is a time of choice where where it's not just shaking out of coincidence but hard choices are being made in this age where we're we're letting the dead bury their dead it's a hard choice to make but you've got to progress with the word you can't have your theory of it and have the word at the same time but you've got to make a choice we've got to recognize there's a way to know between what's Theory and what's the word in Israel's day they had a way that they could tell if it was the theory or if it was the voice of God right they were in the same situation we're in here's Balaam rising up as a false prophet and do we believe him he's got gifts and signs he's got a powerful Ministry do we believe that or do we stay with Moses in the voice of God see you see how you confusion comes in and the Devil is a is a master at getting in our mind and causing confusion and getting us to to look at a brother that we were we were so Kindred with at one time that there's no way that we would ever be pulled apart and now we're even doubting if he's a Christian because the devil's gotten in there and it's put a wedge between this I don't know I don't know what I'm getting into but confusion of the mind is where the devil works best if he can get in and confuse how how how we how we process what's going on in a church assembly you know a church assembly is the hardest place to get everybody to get along because everybody comes you're supposed to be accepting you're supposed to be welcoming but somebody's gonna have to stand for the word at some point and some toes will get stepped on at some point but it's got to be that way for us to stand for the word of course the devil's not he's going to try to come in here he's going to try to cause Discord he's going to try to cause disruption that's his job but our job as a Ministry is to call out those things and say that is false that's not what the prophet said that's not the way we should act and carry on that's not and some might call it a clothesline religion but I for one am a preacher who believes that the word is still the word and it should be preached as the prophet preached it as Paul preached it as Timothy preached it it should be preached the same way we shouldn't have to change the word to change with the times but God's word is never failing well I don't like the way that that old word made me feel well you need to change you don't try to change the word and say well it really hurt me the way that that was brought the word is the word there's a way to know if it's your theory or if it's the word like I said in in Israel's day they had a way to know but the devil's so good he will try to impersonate everything up to the word he can sing he can shout he can dance he can sit there like a bump on a log he could say man you can say Glory he can impersonate everything except for the word and the Bible said that in the last days the devil will impersonate Christianity so close till it'll deceive the very elected if possible I love that word if possible if it were possible we would be deceived that's right so we must test it and how did they test it in their day to the urum and thumb the breastplate of Aaron that had those stones in it the carbuncle Jasper Diamond Ruby Sapphire all those tones that represented the birth of these 12 Patriarchs was in the breastplate of Aaron and when a prophet prophesied in that sacred light flashed over God said that is the truth but no matter how real it seemed if it didn't flash on that it wasn't the truth so that yerman thumb and went with that priesthood but this Bible is God's urum thumbum today and when a prophet prophesies it must absolutely flash with the Bible then God says and he comes down and proves it this is a word Prophet telling you how to identify a word prophet if what I say does not line up with the Bible then don't believe me but if what I say lines up with the Bible it's the urum and thumb for today and it's thus saith the Lord right so there's a way to know now you think well if we had that that holy of holies and we could walk back in there and we could have those stones Flash and we could ask it a question am I going the right direction in my life is this the perfect will of God for my life you walk in there and as the voice would ring forth the stones would cast a rainbow or they would not and by that you would know that dream was of the Lord that prophecy was of the Lord or that tongues was of the Lord but but the light had to ring true in order for that to be lined up now there's a specific order to how God designed this and I believe there's a specific order uh to how he's designed the church in this last age it's okay if we're just trying to build a little bit it's all right I'm not a tech guy but I got a buddy Joe and a buddy that uh maybe has a picture of that this is out of Exodus 28. I know this is maybe a little Sunday school on a Saturday night but that's all right and thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work after the work of the ephot Thou shalt make it of gold a blue and a purple and of scarlet and a fine twine linen shout thou make it Foursquare it shall be doubled a span shall be the length thereof and a span shall be the breadth thereof and thou shalt said in settings of stones even four rows of stones the first row shall be as hard as a topaz and a carbuncle this shall be the first row and the second row shall be an emerald a sapphire and a diamond and the third row a legur and a gate in an amethyst and the fourth row a barrel and an onyx and a Jasper they shall be set in gold in their enclosings and the stone shall be with the names of the children of Israel 12 according to their names like the Engravings of a Signet everyone with his name shall they be according to the 12 tribes so those are pretty Specific Instructions right and we got the picture of it up there see it's pretty specific how it's laid out and there's a specific stone for each row and the roads were identified of course gold being the backlayment and they would they would fashion this gold and and this was this was the most holy place that there that there was in Israel so this wasn't just thrown together in some some Pebbles glued on there but this was gold that was fashioned in the fire that was beaten until they could see their reflection and then they chose these Stones by hand and as the lord gave him instruction they would say these Stones because this is the only way now it sounds very unnatural for you to be able to speak to those stones and them to cast a light right it seems very unnatural that you would be able to to put on a tape somewhere sometime while you're living in sin and all of a sudden your life just flip around it seems very unnatural that you might drag yourself into the back door and the voice of the preacher coming across the pulpit might change your life forever seems pretty unnatural but God is a supernatural God God is such a supernatural God that even the sound of his voice can change your entire outcome of where you're headed in your life just one word from him can change every direction in which we're headed you might think well I know the path I'm headed but you wait till God says something else about it wait till God changes the very direction that you're headed in he's a supernatural God but these this voice was spoken over the stones and it Vindicated it to be the voice of the Lord but we don't have the urim and some of them today I mean brother Tim's got a mini one in his office I saw but I don't think it probably ring the rainbow colors we don't have that today you imagine if we had that today how many people will be fighting for it to know the to know the will of God to know the perfect word how many people would be coveting that how many people would fight their way to get to that urm and thumb them that they might know that this is the right way to go I mean how many in here we want to know I'm in the perfect will of God I'm in the perfect will if you know you're walking in the perfect will you can be absolutely Fearless of where you're headed because you know you're on a commission you know that you've been purposed for it I believe that if we had the actual physical urum and thumb today there would be a riot to get your hands on it right there'd be a there'd be a line out the door where people would come in and they'd want to have their their moment with the urum and thumb them right kind of like when the prophet was here and they wanted to have just their couple minutes with the profit they wouldn't take the time to listen to what he was preaching but they wanted their couple minutes with him that he might discern them and it would take the easy way out of the situation we don't live in an easy age this is not an easy button age but this is the hardest age that there ever has been this is the darkest hour that there ever will be we don't live in an easy button age that would be nice and I'm not I'm not shaming anybody that has a tremendous testimony that's not what I'm getting at of visiting with a prophet in the miraculous happening obviously I believe God sent a prophet and I believe he had the Messiah sign and I would have I would have traveled across the world to spend just a couple minutes but we don't have that today we don't have the urum in some of them today so it must be that thus saith the Lord's not here today no I don't believe that I don't believe that thus saith the Lord cease to exist on December the 24th 1965 but I believe we have the saith the Lord in our midst I believe what the prophet preached to us was that the bride has thus saith the Lord or she keeps still right so that means it's laying within the church thus saith the Lord is still laying within the church what is it it's the Vindicated word of the hour coming out just like he preached it now we live in an age of confusion right where the devil's getting in and he's trying to confuse this and confuse that and he'll take a quote and make you think that you don't have you don't have the Holy Ghost and he'll take a quote and make you think that there's no way you could be lost and we're back and forth and back and forth but there is a way to know that we're walking in the perfect will of God there's a way to know that there's a balance to this there's a way to know that you have the whole package already in you you're not waiting for it to come but it's already laying within you these Stones here on this tablet were just Stones they just laid there on that year and thumb and they just laid there in that in that tent way back in there until a voice came across them and then all of a sudden those stones had a purpose those stones reflected a light they reflected the voice of God that came out across them and they became a value right until then they were just laying dormant in the in in the tent there but they had a purpose I believe we have the saith the Lord we'll do exactly what he's said to do in the spirit that he said to do it it's not so much that I can type in here anybody can grab a table app and they can type in their favorite quote and you can feed me all these quotes but if you don't have the spirit of how the prophet brought it then it's never gonna free anybody it's never going to heal anybody it's never going to bring Liberation to anybody but you've got to have the spirit that the messenger brought it in is that okay it's our commission if I could say it's the challenge of the hour to walk in the spirit of the word not just quote it fundamentally but to walk in the spirit of the word Hallelujah and there came out of nowhere don't even give his name I don't guess the prophet was interested in his name he was interested in one thing God had anointed him he didn't make any difference whether he was classed one of their denominations or something else whether he was a bishop or an Archbishop the only thing that he was interested in was the message on his heart and he called the people back to repentance and an understanding that their God was a god of Might and a god of Deliverance a god of Miracles that snatched him out of the hands of the Egyptians opened up the Red Sea and fed them into the Wilderness and the god a god of Might who could take the land from someone else and give it to them amen that was a true prophet he was anointed and he was the voice of God to them people he spoke it that it must be so because they were in trouble these midianites and amorites and so forth had all come over to eat up all their land and so the enemy had challenged and he must be met the enemy's challenged and he must be met we're living at the same Junction of time the armies couldn't do it and their priests couldn't do it and their churches couldn't do it so it took the word of God to meet his Challenge and the enemy speaks today the enemy tries to say to the days of Miracles has passed and there's no such thing as the baptism in the Holy Spirit and this is only emotion it's only a workup so the enemy has challenged and his challenge must be met are we ready to meet the challenge of the hour the only way we can meet the challenge of the day when the denominations call the people away and put them in this organization and that organization let them women cut their hair and make up and man in all kinds of lives lives as trustees and deacons and Pastors in the church because they got some PhD or lld is the requirement Jesus never did require a man to have that Jesus requirement was wait in the city of Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high then you are a witness to me that meets his challenge that meant the enemy's challenge that meant it in that day it will meet it in this day that's why the Church of the Living God has such an attack on how we worship that's why the Church of the Living God is is trying to be bound up that we're too free or are we worshiped too freely or we enjoy ourselves a little bit too much well you can have your opinion but as for me I'll rise to the challenge of the hour you can believe it the way you want to but as for me I'll go ahead and enjoy salvation as for me I'll go ahead and enjoy joy in my life I'll enjoy not having bondage I'll enjoy not being a changer shackles are wondering if I'm going to make a Rapture I'll go ahead and enjoy the Liberty that comes with the revealed word of the hour to say I never did it in the first place oh please that's the challenge of the hour not to be in bondage anybody could be in bondage we are called a commission to break free from that and say I am a different level I'll now settle for methodists or Baptists or Presbyterian somewhere out from another cut I came from another section of the cloth in my section we're free in my section we have Liberty to Worship in my section of heaven we go ahead and shout and we say amen and we say holy holy holy to the Lord that's what we were called to do the challenge of the hour has been brought to our door what will we do with it it'll be back up and say you know I'm just going to go ahead and back up on the way I believe or are we called to meet the challenge of the hour that's been brought to our church into our home into our beliefs don't tell me that you haven't ran across it because it's coming against the Church of the Living God not just here in Louisiana but all over the world the challenge is brought to the church will we back down will we take the word and move forward if God be with us he says how can the Holy Spirit who wrote the Bible deny it how can the Holy Spirit living in a man say oh it was for the disciples Jesus said whosoever will Peter said the promise is unto you and to your children and then that's so far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call the Holy Ghost was for whomever God called so we say God called me here he said those who he predestinated he foreknew he ordained and they accepted no man can come to me said Jesus said my father draws him and all that the father has given me will come to me do we come in a worked up emotion do we come to join the church do we come because we don't want to go to hell or do we come because we love God that gave His only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should have everlasting life do we come because it's a love sacrifice that God give to us that we might display it display it he says God hates man if I'm serving God I'd want to know what he hates [Applause] if I'm trying to be the best Christian I can be and actually approach the word with an open ear and an open eye and an open heart and actually approach the message with no preconceived ideas of what I wanted to be I would want to know what God hates for example if you search it in the in the in the search God hates Discord among the brethren God hates it he hates backfighting he hates the gossip he hates the back and forth and do what you can to to to kill somebody's testimony or their character God hates it you know what else God hates a powerless religion he hates it I'd want to know what God hates and if I was trying to please please the Lord I'd want to run as far away as I could from what God hates I'd want to get as far away from that as I possibly could if God hates a powerless religion I don't want to be identified anywhere near a powerless religion you'll never confuse me for being a psychologist I want to be so far away from that that you'll never have to ask me the question what do you believe to let my voice read tonight to say I believe in a religion with power I believe in a god with power the Holy Ghost with power I believe in the people with power that will perform the works because it's him and them performing them that's what we believe don't be yoked up with that but get free from that I don't want to be anywhere near it you'll never confuse me for that why because I preach against it and the problem is we have too many weak pulpits that are so afraid to lose somebody they're so afraid to lose people or lose or lose a mentor somewhere they're afraid to preach the truth and then we have the Holy Ghost on the outside of the church wanting to get in [Applause] it's okay I get a little carried away so never confuse me for that why would we want to be confused for that God hates it he hates a powerless religion their religion has no power so what must he do to this day every time in the Bible that God ever every time that there ever came a Reformation or Revival it was backed with Great Signs and powers where God is he is Supernatural where God displays himself there's got to be Supernatural he can impersonate almost up to the real thing they can impersonate almost up to the real thing but you're not an impersonation Church you're not an impersonation you're the genuine article you're the real deal you know there's art collectors from all over the world and their job is to examine a piece and to identify that it's the real deal to identify that it's the real peace and say yeah that that's the one see this one here it's got a little you know it was it was made it was a good impersonation but it's not the real deal but I believe I'm preaching to the real deal tonight that wasn't just forced and some denominations somewhere through some man's Theory but but God called us here that we might fulfill [Applause] Ed the Rapture of this age he can impersonate it but he can't be you nobody can have your spot nobody I can't have it but Aaron can't have it nobody can have your spot you don't need to change to be like me or change to be like brother Joe God made you exactly how you are you're an original you're a one-off you're a piece of art you're you're so handcrafted in his mind that he made you exactly the way you are that even through those complexes you could fulfill all righteousness it's in you to do it it's in you to take a body change it's already laying within you you don't need to change you just need to get under the power of the Holy Ghost and those stones that laid their dormant will become living stones that will come Lively Stones they'll become alive with the fire of God now the scripture says that when the voice came forth a light went across the stones but they did not have a flashlight or a light bulb there but a light in the scripture is the fire of God so when his voice came out it was actual fire that went through that tent and cast upon the stones and they became Lively Stones I don't believe in second Peter he said that we're to be dead stones but we're to be Lively Stones is that okay I'm not trying to work you up I'm preaching you the scripture I think it's time that we identify where we're at I don't think we should back up to anybody say no just I'll just humble down on on the word no I'll humble down on a lot of things but I will not humble down on the word Esau represented the man of Earth natural religious incline but never able it wasn't in him to do it he couldn't do it he never was in him to be able to climb a past the things of the world the carnal thing but Jacob it was just so easy for him to do it now Jacob one purpose Jacob had and that was that he longed for that Birthright no matter how he got it just so he got it it wasn't in Esau to do it wasn't in it he didn't have the capability to hunger and thirst for that Birthright he couldn't do it Jacob could go to a place that Esau literally could not go the the prophet said it right there it wasn't in him yeah it wasn't in him he couldn't do it it didn't ring true there was there was nothing he could do with it it just wasn't it wasn't in him to take the birthright like the brother said last night we're built to go places yeah that the devil can't follow us it's not in him to do it we're built to go places into the word that the devil never even thought of going he never even imagined that it was a possibility but it's in us to do it we're built for the challenge of the hour We're made with the ingredients it's going to take to overcome the challenge of the hour we don't got to worry about him impersonating us we've got to get to a place where he can't follow us we've got to climb to a higher realm where he cannot walk with us anymore he can't walk straight for stride with us where we're going there's somewhere where he's going to get caught up there's somewhere where he cannot fulfill the whole word there's somewhere where he's not going to do it now if I if if let's just God forgive me but let's just say I was Lucifer preaching to you tonight and I was using the message and I was using the quotes and I was quoting all your favorite preachers and I was I was preaching it hard to you with power would you be able to say man careful would you be able to say Amen no because I'm gonna use it for my benefit if I'm Lucifer I'm never going to take you to a place where you're free I can't it's not in me to do it if I'm Lucifer I'm physically incapable of preaching the word in a position where you get Liberty I'm physically incapable of preaching the entire word in a way that you could go free so you see it's easy to discern a spirit no matter how Mighty the Mind might be or how big his church might be or how many members worship him it's easy to identify a spirit if it brings you down it's not the word if it lifts you up it's the word of the hour if it lifts you up it's Vindicated if it lifts you up you're free if it lifts you up I say walk in Freedom but don't dare be found caught in transition between a Ministry that will drive you down and you lead more depressed than what you came in that's not the spirit of the message that's some man's Theory or some spin on what the prophet preached that is not what I hear when I hear William Brandon preach what I hear when I hear Tim Pruitt preach that's not what I hear when I hear weight loss and preach I hear the spirit of Liberty ringing out over the people of God saying go free you're free you're free that's the spirit of the message not only do we got to say what he said we've got to say in the spirit that he said it is why is that so hard say it in the spirit why it's so hard is because you don't listen to the tank it's so hard because you just read that one quote and move on listen to the message it will never bring you down [Applause] it's liberty it's our hope it's Christ in this hour how could it bring you down how could it make you feel like you're gonna miss it like you somehow missed something you are complete in him thank you not missed it you are it it's about you this whole book is about you it's Christ coming out in the bride it's a love story it's a book of love it's about you like a book about me ever read about my wife it's my love story [Applause] it's about her [Applause] why would we ever feel condemned reading it how can we look at this and say oh I just don't know when I read this I can't help but cry he's talking about me [Applause] I will put my spirit in her and she will perform the Greater Works not only that but I'm Gonna Save the final word for her [Applause] you're built for better than where we're living you're built for higher than wherever you're at I guarantee I know I'm built for higher than where I'm living I was built to fulfill every word every line every letter every punctuation I was built for it God spoke it because he knew that was what I would do God spoke the word because he knew there would be somebody come that would say it's mine he did it I can too if you did it I can too this is not a one-man message this is an I can too message we're walking where the Angels Fear to try in the Divine word of the hour ah we should not be ashamed of anything that we're doing I rebuke that spirit that would come on the Church of the Living God that would bring her down for realizing where she's at and then feeling sorry for it no not while I have breath in my lung I say recognize where you're at and give God praise for it is that I recognize all free I recognize that I'm liberated I recognize you know what else Scott Hanks on Nickelodeon Spirit I'm free from that we're free but now we're free we ain't gotta worry about it God spoke it over us there will be a people I say it's us I say here I am he's not built to walk where you can walk he physically is incapable of it I left my hanky in that jacket somewhere he can't do it you're built higher than he was built You Came From Another Part of the mind of God you came from a little part tucked away back in there where that covering cherub never was able to see that covering cherub didn't have access to where you came from you didn't come from the realm of anxiety and depression and sickness and cancer you didn't come from that realm You Came From Another realm beyond that that the angel couldn't even look at that those angels couldn't even see we came from a higher realm than that from the very back part of the mind of God that's where I came from that's why I'm not scared to walk here at this is not my home here but it will be I don't want to fit in here I don't want to blend in at Walmart wasn't made for that I was made to blend in with those that came from the back part of the mind of God now I cannot help it how we act when we came from the back part of the mind of God but I know we came from the same place I'm not ashamed to act like people that where I came from where the failure not ashamed to act where you the neighborhood you grow up in when you get around you're saying This Is How Country Boys act well this is how the bride of Christ Acts this is how we Act we act free forgive me if I don't have shackles binding me but I'm free forgive me if I'm liberated in my spirit where I can say glory to God and not get rust out of the church building but I'm free and he who the son has set free is free indeed somebody say indeed he physically is not able to do it if you can pull up Ezekiel 28 and the 11th verse Man time is flying moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man take up lamentation upon the king of tires of course your Bible students you know speaking of Lucifer and say unto him thus say the Lord God thou sealst up the sum full of wisdom and perfect and Beauty thou husband and eat in the garden of God every precious stone was thy covering the Sardis topaz and the diamond the barrel the Onyx the Jaspers Sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and on gold the workmanship of the tablets on the pipes was prepared in thee in the day that was created Thou Art the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of God thouest walked up and and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that was created until iniquity was found in thee he's built differently you're a civil engineer how many stones did we just count I'm gonna help you nine nine how many do we count in Exodus 28. 12. I'm not a math wizard but it seems like there's something missing it seems that that God's specific ingredients were were right and they were perfect and then when it came down to Bill Lucifer something was left out he's physically not built the same as you're built he's missing something that you have if you take the time to study it we're we're short on time but if you take the time to study it he's missing the third row he's got the first the second and the fourth he's missing the third row of stones remember how exact the the breastplate was to be built it was to be built exactly under the order which Moses gave right exactly this direction exactly these stones in this place representing these exact tribes but he's missing the third row I'm glad we can walk places where the devil cannot walk I'm glad we can receive a word that's why when the word comes forth somehow it just doesn't ring with somebody you say hey man what's the matter with you it's not ringing but for me it's ringing for you it's ringing we say hey that Lit me up why because we're built different than Lucifer was built we're built different than the serpent was built he was built lower than we were built it's missing the third row we're not you'll never get a seven color rainbow if you're missing those three stones you'll never get the full contrast of God's word if you're missing those three stones you'll end up with a six color rainbow which here we are but there's something that Lucifer does not have that you have and you wonder why how am I going to make it because it's in you there's something in you that he does not have we'll take a a few minutes on this the the seventh Stone which will be the first stone in the third row is the lager it's from the tribe of gath it's an amber color the tribe of God means a judge to be Vindicated which I found it pretty interesting that to be Vindicated means to be loosed all right the tribe of GAD represents overcoming power I know this is a well-taught church and you you probably know all this but the the tribe of God represents overcoming power so mark that down as something Satan cannot do he cannot have overcoming power now the interesting part about this seventh Stone The Lager is it's totally worthless you don't even recognize it as a little girl Stone until you put it under a fire and when you put it under a fire that amber light shoots a red light out of it and you recognize that's a liger Stone you put it over the fire and then the value comes to it you put a tribe believer under the fire and watch the value come to it you put a tribe God called son or daughter of God and watch the value come to him we may not look like much up here but you put me under a fire and watch the value come under it you put this church under a fire which I believe it's been and watch the power of God come out of it there's value in it but you've got to go through the fire you've got to go through the fire that's where your value comes from otherwise you're just a dormant Stone laying on a golden breastplate but when you get under the fire where the value comes from you might not ever recognize me to be nothing on this Earth but you watch and you watch when a Son of God is taken through a fiery trial you'll never look at that brother the same that's a real man of God I've seen him in the fire I've seen it when the doctors couldn't figure out what was going wrong I've seen him in the fire that's a real man of God because the value comes out under the trial that's somewhere Satan can't go he can't walk into the fire he doesn't have the material to do it doesn't have it he literally does not have the stone to walk into the fire not built for it but you are [Music] [Applause] a supernatural world maybe you don't see that with your carnal eye you don't see that value of red shining through but you see the spirit of God anointing that individual so how could they ever possibly keep going how could they walk through this fire because they have the seventh Stone they have the full package they're complete in him there's nowhere that they can't go in God's word it's all access pass you can go anywhere that your faith will allow you to go into this word anywhere including cancer being defeated anywhere including mind battles being defeated anywhere including depression being defeated you are called and anointed to walk there that's our commission to walk there to step into that as brother Isaac said but the value comes what looked like a worthless Stone becomes priceless when you put it in a fire I think of the three the three Hebrew children walking into a fire now we live in a supernatural world where we don't see their Spirits coming and their Spirits going the Angels here maybe we don't see him but we we know he's here but we also know there's sickness in the building now if it was easy as easy I know we got medical folk in here if it was easy as putting your your your your your broken arm under an x-ray and you and they say oh the Bone's broken there and we can work on that but we're not battling flesh and blood but spiritual principalities and powers in high places and so we we walk into the church house and maybe we don't even recognize it but there's a spirit that's been attacking us all day there's something that's been binding us maybe for 20 years maybe just this afternoon but there's something that's that's trying to take hold of you that you can't see if it was as easy as for C Aaron could take care of it he just knocked the guy out but we can't see it it's in another world right brother Brandon would explain it in a prayer line he would somebody would come through and he would say you have a deaf Spirit that's taking hold of your hearing it's put it's binding your hearing I see the spirit and it's wrapped around your hearing canal and that Spirit has to be removed in order for you to hear right so it's easy for us to see that's how that person's death is there's a there's a spirit a transparent band brother random called it that's cutting off the circulation to their hearing right and then another patient would come by and you say you're blind there's a there's a spirit that's bound or optic nerve and you can't see I believe many of us probably have transparent bands there's things affecting our lives that we try to get rid of and we try to figure out how to deal with and we've tried to figure out how to get rid of it and we can't see it and we don't know when it's coming we don't know when it's going and it comes and goes and it's a transparent band now if I put a band around my wrist like this and I put it real tight my fingers are going to get purple I'm gonna lose circulation to these fingers and they're going to become dead fingers they're going to be useless to me there's nothing I'm going to be able to do with them I'm not going to be able to feel them you ever you ever slept wrong in the bed and you wake up and your hands about useless because you you cut off the circulation right well that's what demons in this hour are trying to do to the Church of God is cut off the circulation the flow of life into into our rooms they're trying to cut that off but there's only one way to get rid of that band now where that patient stepped on the platform and they were deaf there was not brother Branham standing there but there was a pillar of fire standing there there was a fire between them and the end of the prayer line there was a fire between them and their healing there was a fire between them and total Victory you understand there's only one way to get rid of the transparent band in your life it's to walk in the fire right the three Hebrew children were taken to the fire and the King said take my mightiest men to bind them I want to make sure they don't get away but the devil's not built to go in the fire so that King lost seven of his mightiest men in that fire because he sent him to go ahead and keep charging them they melted in the fire you know the prophet taught us the only thing the fire did for those children was loose their bands the only thing the fire of God will do for you is set you free from complex the only thing the fire of God will do is fill you with the Holy Ghost the only thing the fire of God will do for you is heal you of cancer is heal you of diabetes this hill you have depression there's a fire between you and your healing [Applause] there's something in between your prodigal and coming home it's the fire of God [Applause] Daniel and the Lion's Den what kept those Lions away fire the devil is afraid of Fire why because he knows in the end it's the Lake of Fire there's nowhere in the scripture where the devil Walks Into Fire there's nowhere where a spirit can follow you when you're walking into a fire now you might think well I don't want to go through another trial don't get in the fire of God come underneath the pillar of fire surrendering to the message surrendering to this word not your theory not your idea but come underneath it where the impersonations cannot last now watch the pattern he says Judas Iscariot followed those same tracks he was justified by Believing on the Lord and then accept him as a personal savior I thought this was tremendous Judas received him as a personal savior he was Sanctified and give the power to cast out Spirits put his name on Lamb's Book of Life but when it come to Pentecost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost the fullness of the word he showed his colors he couldn't produce the color he couldn't produce the rainbow that you can produce when it came down to Pentecost he could not produce what it took to cross over he could not produce what it took to take the promised land he couldn't do it it wasn't in him he didn't have it doesn't have the capability that's why I don't get caught up fighting with people that just don't have it there's only one message of the Holy Ghost it's moved forward that's what we should do is leave aside the fighting and we'll stand for the message and move forward they're just not built for it but I was I believe you were somebody say I was built for that fire it showed his true colors that's exactly what the Canaan spies did that's exactly what Esau done that's exactly what Satan done to Eve in the garden it showed their true colors I don't care Judas could have done all kinds of signs wonders but when he come to receive the holy ghost at the day of Pentecost he showed his colors the devil can come right up and impersonate right to the very thing till it comes to this word but he can't take all that word he can bring it all up maybe to one word like Eve the devil did to Eve but he can't cross it all because the whole thing is the body of Christ the whole thing complete in him you're not an impersonator you're the real one you're not the counterfeit you're the reality you're the one the counterfeit was spun off of you're the reality of it now that eight stone will try to hurry is the a gate that represents the Neftali tribe which means through difficulty it's a common Stone found out you might go find him out here just looks like any Old Stone until you cut it and when you cut it and you polish it it becomes a beautiful stone it becomes the stone we saw up there on the breastplate it becomes a beautiful thing that they might have value to it but it's got to be cut it's got to be fashioned it's got to be it's got to be molded and it's it's through difficulty that that Stone comes it's through the trial of our faith but when you have the stone you can go through the trial when you have that ingredient you're going through the track you're going to make it out on the other side it's through great difficulty but that's where Joe was when he recognized he had the third row when he said I was there I'm in the greatest trial of my life I don't know how I'm gonna make it out of this situation but I was there and if I was there I've got to go back to there if I was ever in the mind of God I've got to go back to the mind of God I was there not a fake but the real deal I was there when the sons of God me out for joy I was there when they said yeah friends there's too much scripture to come against the move of God there's too much scripture in here I'm not picking this I didn't just hot spot quotes but there's too much in here to come against the holy move of God there's just too much it's where God operates and you wonder why you can't keep your young people out of porn addictions and you can't keep your young people out of suicide and you can't keep your preachers from sitting on their wives and you can't keep your church together it's because you don't preach the Holy Ghost that will actually change the situation we have to have seminars on how to do it or some psychological approach preach the Holy Ghost it'll do the fixing you're never going to get this fixed on your own idea you would have fixed it already but the Holy Ghost when he comes he the spirit of Truth Shall lead you and guide you into all truth he's on the outside unfortunately of so-called message churches he's not welcome in their pulpit I thank God that there's still some pulpits today brother Tim I thank God for I got kids I got young ones coming up I have my experience but I got young ones coming up and I thank God that there has been pillars that have stood and have fought for what we believe in that have stood the time test that have students they've weathered the storm where I could bring my children into a sanctuary where they might be filled with the very spirit of God God forbid we ever remove that from our church God forbid we have to remove that for our home I don't care where we're at what we're doing what we're driving if God wants to come fill somebody I say let him fill them thank you we're way too late to be playing games but I canceled the to buy me gold that's been tried in the fire that's not just for everybody that's not just for the nominal world out there or everybody that looks on the name of Jesus but I counsel thee to buy of me gold that's been tried in the fire then if you are a son or daughter of God you were in God all the time somebody say all the time but he knew what bed and time that you would be planted so now you're made a creature a Son of God manifest his son or daughter of God to meet the challenge of the hour to vindicate the true and living God of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time you were predestinated to meet it that's right you were done there before the foundation of the world if you wasn't chose that way no matter how much you try to impersonate it you'll never make it how can you get blood from a turnip when there's no blood in there but we are not impersonating you're not impersonating you're the real deal Rebecca you're the real deal my gosh who is he preaching about well who's going to be the real deal who are we waiting on well one day that'll be okay in the short quick work we'll dance and Shout well where are we well who's going to fulfill it who's going to go out and come out of the highways and the byways you know sometimes we go through trials in our life that we don't even fathom why we could be going through it maybe this 2022 was just that year for you you thought that I'm going through a trial I don't know why in the world I'm going through it I don't know if I'll be able to come out on the other side I'm sure God has a purpose for it but God always has a purpose your footsteps are ordered as in you're walking in his will your footsteps are ordered of the Lord sometimes we go through trials I know we're over our time we've got a couple a lot more here but we'll just cut it out we go through trials that we we wonder wonder what's what's the point of this I remember back in the in the early spring of 2018. I got a phone call and I had lost somebody really close to me we talked to the phone every day every day he was living out trying to serve the Lord and doing his best I believe he he he had the revelation to be in the resurrection but he was taken home suddenly by by just an accident and I wondered what the Lord I said what what purpose could this be for what could this be for why why couldn't he just I couldn't just heal him why'd he have to let the accident happen well you know at that time I we were kind of living a little bit more isolated and I didn't really have a lot of phone calls and people to visit with the word about and and he was my buddy and we visited on the word and we talked about the scripture and we we made a bond that way and then one day he's just gone and I got to be honest I was I was not bitter but I was questioning the Lord are you sure this was correct I I guess that maybe he was going to fall away and maybe that that just there wasn't a place for him and that was the best way out of his situation that he was in maybe that was the best way but then at our youth camp two years ago I watched two young people come through that prayer line and the power of the Holy Ghost fall upon him and it all made sense to me brother l he had you in his mind he had you in his mind went to that Brother's funeral in the middle of Mississippi somewhere there were some folks from this trip but Jeff was there yes well it's sitting around the table over turkey necks and Hog's feet began to witness the message to a family where four souls might be saved God knows what he's doing God knows what he's doing Jay he'll bankrupt heaven to bring home your prodigal he'll pour out everything that he is to bring that down he's not lost his power he's not weak in his demonstration say well we haven't seen that in some time God's not lost his power he's still saving he's still going out in the highways and the byways and the bushes where nobody would go no church there in the middle of Mississippi God found a way to find the Sheep God always finds a way to find his sheep and he didn't bring you this far to leave you now but he's going to see it through God always finds a way he's not lost his mind he's not lost his power he's the same God that he was when he parted the sea he's the same God that he was when he walks on the water he's the same God when he said Lazarus come forth he's the same God when he says William broccoli come forth he's the same dog the same power it's the same mind doing the same work he's not lost him he's still gone but we've got to Humble ourselves to come under the word the last stone that he does not have is humility he's uncapable of becoming humble to the word I'm gonna finish right here he doesn't have it in him Cain did not have it in him to repent but the Zeal of our hour is to repent the Zeal of the laodicean church is to repent come back to the word come back to Pentecost get back to where the power of God is real we have it in us to be humble enough we'll be humble enough to believe a lie somebody tell you that you're ugly or you're never gonna make it or you're unsuccessful we'll believe that we'll humble ourselves down to that lie but what about the truth what about when God says there's an age of the overcomer what a church of laodicea I write to them that overcometh will I grant us sit with me [Applause] what about it will you humble yourself to that will you humble yourself to put this word in your mouth and speak it over your trial [Applause] I'm humble enough to say I speak victory put it in your mouth I don't know what it is I don't care what it is have the humility to come underneath the word and put it in your mouth and confess it let the stone fly the challenge of the hour has come to our door are we ready to meet the challenge [Applause] there's some old blinds saying hey is his theology makes sense he said we don't all have to be deemed crazy you just let one of you die and you come underneath me you just back up on that Holy Ghost Doctrine a little bit and I'll back off your church I'll back off the attacks you just back off on that dancing a little bit and I'll back off the Mind battles don't tell me he hasn't told you that the challenge of the hours here you just back up on on claiming your particle you don't want to scare them away there's a Goliath out there his theology makes sense well I'm caught in the in between maybe it's true maybe it's not if we have the humility to sit underneath a lie we ought to have the humility to come underneath the truth of the word and say that's false Doctrine say that so that's a Lucifer anointing coming into my life that's a transparent band that I need to burn off in the fire of God no messenger came in my day to tell me that I wasn't gonna make it no messenger came and lived a life above reproached to tell me that I just didn't have enough but when I gonna make it you've got the stones you've got the material it's in you to fulfill our righteousness in you or you just back up on preaching that no I don't think I will you just back up on having those tent revivals in those meetings and youth camps and where where people just read no I don't think I will [Applause] I don't think I'm gonna back down to no giant yeah come on he's a bluff he's got nothing I don't think I will back down I think I'll preach this harder than I've ever appreciated in my life I think if I have breath in my lungs I'm going to preach Liberation in the Church of God as long as I've got power in these lungs I will be found preaching freedom I don't think I'm gonna back up at all I say it's time to come totally under the humility of the word and say Lord do what you will with me if you never cause me to dance fine have you never cause me to speak in tongues fine if you never cause me to worship like I see others worshiping fine do whatever God puts on your heart to do [Applause] if God calls you to have a prophetic word God forbid us to hold it back if God called you to dance in the spirit under the anointing of the power of Liberation you go on ahead and dance if God calls you to let us scream out that lets the release out of your life you go ahead and scream see we're all original we're all pieces of heart fashioned away God fashioned us that he wanted us to be you don't have to act like me that's okay I already got brother Joe but don't ever be found guilty of oppressing the power of God in your life sister Adeline if you have a gift to sing Let It Go don't ever be found guilty of holding back because of what somebody might think if your pastor's ashamed of you find another pastor [Music] if your friends are ashamed of you get new friends I'll be your friend for the air to be your friend sister cyan will be your friend get new friends don't ever let the devil put that band on the move of God in your life because you will never walk in Freedom again [Music] there's a fire between you and your victory [Applause] [Music] the Zeal of our hour is to repent and when we're done repenting that's where the power comes power is in humility if our music players would come if we can't humble ourselves to the word we'll never walk where he walked oh Lord if it be possible let this cup pass for me nevertheless Lord thy will be done thy will be done I wonder how many of us could say that with our hearts but I will be done Lord whatever you have your desire for me is I may not ever hold a microphone in my hand never step behind a Pulpit whatever your desire is for me Lord that's what I want to fulfill it's God's will that you walk in perfect hell it's God's will that you walk in the power of the Holy Ghost these are things we can just get right out of the way it's not God's will that you walk in defeat it's not God's intention that you walk wondering if I'm going to come in here one day and why is everybody gone friends you're not going to miss the rapture you are the rapture it's happening it's an event it's already happening it's coming forth we're walking in it walking in it brother Silas a year ago you couldn't say that but today you can say that why because there's a fire between you and your Victory and he was humble enough to come under that fire oh and if there's anybody near Humble enough to walk through the fire of God say I don't want to just be identified with it I want to be covered in it I don't want to just be labeled as and I want to be totally covered in it hard decisions are made but they're the direction of the Lord for the Jackson he's going to bless you friends I know you don't know me but I just I just do what the Lord tells me amen walk through the fire with him a while why don't you just come walk with me
