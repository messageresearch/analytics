[59:38] remember us in prayer
[59:40] amen i certainly appreciate that
[59:42] we serve a big god
[59:45] and we need him to minister to the
[59:47] hearts of the people without him
[59:49] we can do nothing
[59:52] so we're looking to him and looking to
[59:54] you to pray for us and
[59:56] and just remember the work of god

[1:00:10] lord will minister you in a special way
[1:00:12] and that you'll be ministered to today
[1:00:16] from the word let's turn to genesis 18
[1:00:18] verse 1. i want to read that today from
[1:00:22] down to verse 3.
[1:00:24] and there's just so many wonderful
[1:00:26] things that lays in the word of god
[1:00:29] and how we appreciate that so much
[1:00:31] genesis 18 1
[1:00:33] and the lord appeared unto him in the
[1:00:36] plains of mamrie
[1:00:38] and he sat in the tent door in the heat
[1:00:40] of the day and he lift up his eyes and
[1:00:44] looked and lo three men stood by him and
[1:00:46] when he saw them he ran to meet them
[1:00:48] from the tent door and bowed himself
[1:00:51] toward the ground
[1:00:53] and said my lord
[1:00:56] this is very key my lord if i
[1:00:59] if now i have found favor in thy sight
[1:01:03] pass not away i pray thee from thy
[1:01:06] servant amen god bless you you can be
[1:01:08] seated
[1:01:10] i'm going to be speaking today on the
[1:01:12] mask
[1:01:13] and so
[1:01:14] we're going to be looking here into this
[1:01:17] part of the of this service
[1:01:20] and this revelation that god has given
[1:01:22] us remember what we have read is not
[1:01:25] just a
[1:01:27] page in the bible that is history but it
[1:01:31] is prophecy
[1:01:33] and so we are here in the in the very
[1:01:36] fulfilling of this prophecy
[1:01:39] so actually when jesus took the bible
[1:01:42] and he opened the book
[1:01:44] and he opened it to isaiah 61 and he
[1:01:48] said he said the spirit of the lord is
[1:01:51] upon me
[1:01:52] for he hath anointed me to preach the
[1:01:54] gospel to the poor and to bind up the
[1:01:56] broken heart and so on that jesus
[1:01:58] actually turned to the place that he was
[1:02:02] in the scripture
[1:02:03] what we're doing today is we're looking
[1:02:06] in the bible and we're looking to see
[1:02:09] ourself because
[1:02:11] it is about us it is a revelation of
[1:02:14] jesus christ and his church
[1:02:17] so now as we look at this we see abraham
[1:02:21] is sitting in the tent door and he is
[1:02:24] watching for his appearing now i think
[1:02:26] this is very important when we come to a
[1:02:30] service even like this or even even
[1:02:32] every day in our daily life we should be
[1:02:35] watching for his appearing
[1:02:38] there should be a certain expectation
[1:02:41] uh you know not not just to treat this
[1:02:44] as another denominational church service
[1:02:46] and we do our religious duties that's
[1:02:49] not what this is about
[1:02:51] if we if that's what it's about we just
[1:02:54] might as well stay in some
[1:02:55] denominational system
[1:02:57] but you see god has called us out for a
[1:03:00] purpose and that is a that is that he is
[1:03:04] appearing to his people in the last day
[1:03:08] so we should come with every service
[1:03:11] with anticipate
[1:03:12] anticipation for the lord's appearing
[1:03:15] now he may appear in one service and it
[1:03:17] may be a jubilant service and we dance
[1:03:20] the owls and we shout and we scream or
[1:03:23] he may appear again and it be very
[1:03:26] sobering and very serious and dealing
[1:03:29] deeply with the soul and and and you may
[1:03:32] be you may sat in your your pew weeping
[1:03:35] or he may he may appear and it be
[1:03:38] instruction
[1:03:40] and you're not shouting at all about it
[1:03:42] but you're you're you're learning and
[1:03:44] you're into being instructed in the
[1:03:46] knowledge of god so you see there's not
[1:03:49] just one way that god appears
[1:03:52] so we but we are look we should look for
[1:03:55] his appearing every service and have an
[1:03:59] expectation that god is going to speak
[1:04:02] something very clearly and precise to us
[1:04:06] today
[1:04:07] because we are his bride his people and
[1:04:10] he is here to fellowship with us
[1:04:13] and to speak to us things concerning
[1:04:16] himself
[1:04:18] you know what he's doing is whispering
[1:04:20] the love secrets
[1:04:21] like a man
[1:04:23] and a a boy and a girl that are that is
[1:04:26] going together and they're sitting close
[1:04:28] and they're whispering to each other
[1:04:30] their love secrets and sharing the the
[1:04:34] very intimate desires and thoughts of
[1:04:37] their hearts amen now so you see they're
[1:04:41] learning about us and we've got to know
[1:04:43] our bridegroom before that we go to the
[1:04:47] meeting in the air
[1:04:49] so these are things in his appearing
[1:04:51] that he does now abraham is sitting in
[1:04:53] the tent door and he is watching for his
[1:04:56] appearing
[1:04:58] now of course sarah is in the tent now
[1:05:00] that she's also the church so you know
[1:05:03] there are there are some that are
[1:05:04] watching and some that are
[1:05:08] maybe they're just waiting
[1:05:11] maybe they don't even know what they're
[1:05:12] waiting on
[1:05:13] maybe they haven't got connected yet
[1:05:16] but i want to say this even if you're
[1:05:19] out of step today
[1:05:22] that does not make you non-bride
[1:05:27] amen listen to the voice of the prophet
[1:05:30] of god saying get back in line
[1:05:33] get back in step so you see i mean there
[1:05:37] there's always that for you that is
[1:05:40] calling you you know never take the word
[1:05:42] of god as condemnation always take it on
[1:05:45] the positive side when you read the
[1:05:48] bible i'm not a judas
[1:05:50] though it's in the bible amen i'm not a
[1:05:52] balaam though he's in the bible i'm not
[1:05:55] the great in the book of
[1:05:56] revelation though that's in the bible
[1:05:58] that's not who we are we look in the
[1:06:01] word to identify who we are as the sons
[1:06:04] and daughters of god
[1:06:06] and we take that part for ourselves now
[1:06:09] now of course brother branham as a
[1:06:11] typologist he always referred to abraham
[1:06:15] as a type of the bride
[1:06:17] and paul did the same i'd like to turn
[1:06:19] with you to galatians 3 16 and and we'll
[1:06:22] just put it clearly now why abraham is
[1:06:26] so important
[1:06:27] now to abraham and his seed word the
[1:06:30] promises made
[1:06:31] he said not unto seeds as of many but as
[1:06:36] a one into thy seed which is christ so
[1:06:39] so to abraham and christ the seed were
[1:06:43] the promises made
[1:06:45] amen
[1:06:46] so it was made to abraham and jesus
[1:06:50] now go down to verse 29 and if you be
[1:06:53] christ and it belongs to him
[1:06:56] then you are abraham's seed
[1:06:59] and heirs according to the promise
[1:07:02] so now if you be christ then dave you've
[1:07:05] been born to him that you are abraham's
[1:07:08] seed and you are heirs of this promise
[1:07:12] so we're looking here in genesis 18 to
[1:07:14] see what we are air to
[1:07:17] it's like going into a variety store and
[1:07:19] you and somebody gave you the whole
[1:07:21] store where you're going in there and
[1:07:22] look and see what all we got
[1:07:24] amen we just walk in there we look and
[1:07:27] we climb up on a stepladder if it's out
[1:07:29] of reach and we get up a little higher
[1:07:31] with god and we look in there and we see
[1:07:33] but we're going to receive everything
[1:07:35] that god has for us
[1:07:37] amen because we are heirs according to
[1:07:40] the promise
[1:07:41] now so brother branham would preach
[1:07:44] many many sermons on abraham
[1:07:46] he would mention abraham in almost every
[1:07:49] sermon there's probably not a sermon
[1:07:50] that he preached that he don't mention
[1:07:52] abraham
[1:07:53] and but there there would be very few
[1:07:56] because abraham the promise is to him
[1:08:00] and to his seed which is christ and if
[1:08:03] we be christ then we are abraham's seed
[1:08:06] so the promise then is ours and we are
[1:08:10] heirs according to the promise now this
[1:08:12] is this was really important to the
[1:08:14] galatians who were gentile people and
[1:08:17] they were trying to cram down them the
[1:08:19] law and tell them they had to have
[1:08:21] circumcision and go back to judaism and
[1:08:24] and paul come along and said no he said
[1:08:27] you are abraham's seed
[1:08:29] and you are you are alienated and away
[1:08:32] from god but you are abraham's seed
[1:08:34] because you have been born again
[1:08:36] all israel is not israel
[1:08:39] amen so there's a natural seed and there
[1:08:42] is a royal seed and you happen to be the
[1:08:44] royal seed of abraham
[1:08:47] so therefore every promise that was
[1:08:49] abraham's is christ and every promise
[1:08:51] that was christ is yours so that makes
[1:08:54] you an error and a joint heir with him
[1:08:58] now abraham just quoting a few things
[1:09:00] that brother madam has to say about him
[1:09:02] abraham is a perfect type of the true
[1:09:05] believer so if you want to know what
[1:09:07] kind of believer you are go back to
[1:09:09] abraham
[1:09:10] amen who was a believer who is washed
[1:09:13] into the lamb whose affections was set
[1:09:16] on things above
[1:09:17] and then he says abraham is a perfect
[1:09:19] type of abraham seed after him in the
[1:09:22] church a people out of the gentiles for
[1:09:25] his name the royal sea
[1:09:28] now you're going to see
[1:09:30] in the in this study and this and this
[1:09:32] it's it's preach teaching uh teaching
[1:09:35] and preaching that there are three
[1:09:37] groups or classes of people that are
[1:09:40] represented here in this genesis story
[1:09:44] and because genesis is the seed chapter
[1:09:48] so whatever you find in its infancy
[1:09:51] there in seed form is going to be in
[1:09:54] maturity in the end time
[1:09:56] so it will be magnified and come to
[1:10:00] multiple harvests so for the seed
[1:10:02] chapter that there are three groups or
[1:10:04] classes of people represented here one
[1:10:08] number one is abraham
[1:10:10] and abraham represents the elected
[1:10:13] called out church so the elected called
[1:10:15] out church is in the book of genesis
[1:10:19] and then two lot the church's natural
[1:10:22] who goes through the tribulation so you
[1:10:24] find him also in the book of genesis
[1:10:28] and then the sodomites who are the
[1:10:30] cannon fodder for the burning they are
[1:10:32] also in the book of genesis
[1:10:35] so three classes of people abraham lot
[1:10:38] and sodomites
[1:10:40] and now so you you have you have there
[1:10:44] um you have those those three kinds
[1:10:47] right here all the way to the end time
[1:10:48] now again abraham was a type of the
[1:10:51] caught the church called out
[1:10:53] wasn't in sodom he was sitting way back
[1:10:56] on the barren grounds of the mountains
[1:10:59] above the riches and the cares of the
[1:11:01] world there's your three classes abraham
[1:11:03] called out the
[1:11:05] and the word church means called out
[1:11:08] abraham the elected church we know
[1:11:10] there's an elected church we know that
[1:11:13] god predestinated the church it's going
[1:11:16] to appear before him without spot or
[1:11:18] wrinkle
[1:11:20] this is why when god looks back at it
[1:11:22] through the blood of the new testament
[1:11:24] he says abraham staggered not at the
[1:11:27] promise of god through unbelief it never
[1:11:30] mentions his failures it never mentions
[1:11:33] his faults the blood has totally
[1:11:36] annihilated all of his sins
[1:11:39] are you with me amen so abraham we know
[1:11:42] he is the elected church we know god
[1:11:45] predestinated that church
[1:11:47] he and here he he types it out in the
[1:11:50] bible before we ever get here he uses
[1:11:54] abraham to live out the mystery of the
[1:11:58] bride in the end time
[1:12:00] now so there's that elected church going
[1:12:02] to be there without spot or wrinkle he
[1:12:05] said so and we know we're a member of it
[1:12:08] how do we get a member of it by dying to
[1:12:10] yourself and being born again
[1:12:12] so if you're born of the spirit of god
[1:12:14] then you are the seed of abraham
[1:12:17] abraham himself which is the type of the
[1:12:19] church it was the last sign he received
[1:12:23] so where we're at right here in genesis
[1:12:27] 18 is the last sign
[1:12:29] before the body change
[1:12:31] the last appearing of god
[1:12:34] before the rapture
[1:12:36] and that's where we're at we are in the
[1:12:38] last appearing of god god is appearing
[1:12:41] now remember there's a difference
[1:12:43] between his coming and his appearing
[1:12:46] he when he comes that's the meeting in
[1:12:48] the air but he is appearing now in in
[1:12:52] among his people are you with me now so
[1:12:55] abraham which is the type of the church
[1:12:58] it was the last sign that he received
[1:13:00] for all the other signs that he received
[1:13:03] was the last one before sodom was wiped
[1:13:06] out so before the burning before the
[1:13:09] before the
[1:13:10] the millennial reign
[1:13:12] we are receiving the last sign in fact
[1:13:15] of the matter is we are that last sign
[1:13:18] now
[1:13:19] abraham abraham is the seer
[1:13:24] the seer in the bride church remember
[1:13:26] genesis 20 and 7. now therefore restore
[1:13:30] the man his wife he says to abimelech
[1:13:33] for he is a prophet
[1:13:36] this is the first time prophet is
[1:13:38] mentioned in the bible
[1:13:40] and abraham is god's prophet
[1:13:43] notice
[1:13:44] he is representing the bride church in
[1:13:48] the end time who will have a seer
[1:13:51] prophet
[1:13:54] and it will be that seer prophet that
[1:13:57] sees and recognizes and identifies his
[1:14:01] appearing
[1:14:05] now notice here
[1:14:08] and he is in the tip door
[1:14:10] anticipating and watching for god's
[1:14:13] appearing
[1:14:15] so he's not just gifted you know to heal
[1:14:17] the sick and and cast out devils and and
[1:14:20] uh and and just preach some nice sermons
[1:14:23] no he's a seer he's a prophet messenger
[1:14:27] god's prophet would be in the last day
[1:14:30] in the bride church
[1:14:32] in the abraham church
[1:14:35] and when we think about abraham think of
[1:14:37] a church a bride elect church not just
[1:14:40] one person
[1:14:41] see abraham isn't brother branham my
[1:14:43] brother branham is in abraham brother
[1:14:45] branham was just a part of the bride
[1:14:47] church
[1:14:49] and abraham and sarah are representing
[1:14:52] the bride church and all his encounter
[1:14:55] and and of course there are those that
[1:14:57] went along with him for the ride you
[1:14:59] know they also believed in jesus and
[1:15:01] also believed in calvary and and they
[1:15:03] also you know went along because abraham
[1:15:06] said god was real and and whatever you
[1:15:09] see and and he comes along that's lot
[1:15:12] and they go through the tribulation
[1:15:14] so there is a church and there is a
[1:15:16] bride
[1:15:18] now so in this end time event this
[1:15:20] abraham the abraham the true church has
[1:15:24] a seer in it
[1:15:26] he has prophetic eyes
[1:15:29] the eyes of his prophet
[1:15:32] catches god's appearing and in
[1:15:34] disappearing is a
[1:15:36] revelation of deity
[1:15:41] oh a revelation of who god is
[1:15:44] now i want you to get it where we're at
[1:15:47] because we are in one of the greatest
[1:15:50] unfoldings of deity that the world has
[1:15:53] ever seen
[1:15:54] now
[1:15:56] in this
[1:15:57] and even though that abraham
[1:16:00] sees three men
[1:16:03] that suddenly appeared beside him but as
[1:16:06] a prophet by revelation he knew that
[1:16:09] there was just one of them
[1:16:12] that was the lord
[1:16:14] so his first and foremost revelation is
[1:16:18] that there is one lord
[1:16:22] amen now turn with me to genesis 18 and
[1:16:25] 2 and he lift up his eyes and
[1:16:28] looked and lo and three men stood by him
[1:16:30] and he saw them he ran to meet them from
[1:16:32] the tent door bowed himself toward the
[1:16:35] ground and said my lord
[1:16:38] he sees three men
[1:16:40] but he only addresses one
[1:16:43] amen
[1:16:45] amen
[1:16:47] there is no greater revelation than the
[1:16:51] supreme deity of our lord jesus christ
[1:16:55] it is the foundational revelation that
[1:16:58] the church is built upon
[1:17:01] who jesus is
[1:17:03] now the greatest of all revelations is
[1:17:06] the supreme deity of our lord jesus
[1:17:09] christ there is absolutely no greater
[1:17:12] revelation than that
[1:17:14] so to begin with the prophet gets what
[1:17:17] the revelation of one lord
[1:17:21] one jehovah
[1:17:24] are you with me
[1:17:25] and so in the revelation of jesus is
[1:17:30] also the revelation of the bride of
[1:17:32] christ and all other unfolding
[1:17:34] revelations of church ages seven seals
[1:17:37] is all
[1:17:39] encapsulated in the revelation of the
[1:17:42] person of jesus christ
[1:17:44] because it's all a revelation of him
[1:17:48] so you can't even get to first base
[1:17:51] unless you believe in the supreme deity
[1:17:55] of our lord jesus christ
[1:17:58] amen now listen
[1:18:00] don't act like this is all ho-hum this
[1:18:03] ought to be something that you rejoice
[1:18:05] in
[1:18:06] that you're not like the sodomites
[1:18:09] you're not even like what
[1:18:12] amen when he saw something come he said
[1:18:14] my lords but when abraham saw him come
[1:18:17] he said my lord
[1:18:19] is that right
[1:18:20] amen here not like the church this
[1:18:23] actually identifies you as the people of
[1:18:27] the book
[1:18:33] and when you're the people of the book
[1:18:35] there isn't but one god
[1:18:38] not multiple deities or two lords
[1:18:43] or one god and jesus is just a man
[1:18:46] and all the other ideas that have come
[1:18:48] out
[1:18:50] listen friends it's it in in this in
[1:18:53] this revelation to abraham
[1:18:56] for just a few hours
[1:18:59] in time the eternal god puts on a mask
[1:19:02] of flesh to appear before abraham
[1:19:06] and this was a revelation of one god to
[1:19:09] abraham
[1:19:10] no matter how many manifestations that
[1:19:13] abraham saw
[1:19:15] and there was still one god never never
[1:19:18] was there
[1:19:19] more than one god
[1:19:21] it never was in his mind that there's
[1:19:24] more than one god
[1:19:26] amen he said here oh israel the lord thy
[1:19:29] god is one lord
[1:19:31] and there's only one lord one jehovah
[1:19:35] that's what he said hero israel the lord
[1:19:37] thy god is one jehovah
[1:19:41] amen so you see the lord thy god
[1:19:44] this this is the bible that is being
[1:19:47] preached hero israel the lord our god is
[1:19:51] one lord that is that is junior romantic
[1:19:54] six and four and this is the earliest
[1:19:56] introduction of god to the human race
[1:19:59] where god is unfolding himself and he
[1:20:02] makes it known israel
[1:20:04] know this
[1:20:07] here's the first commandment
[1:20:10] here's the first thing i want you to
[1:20:12] know hero israel the lord thy god is one
[1:20:15] lord
[1:20:18] one jehovah
[1:20:20] there's not more than one there's only
[1:20:22] one
[1:20:24] amen that's the first commandment and
[1:20:26] jesus confirmed that was the truth and
[1:20:29] the church of jesus christ is built on
[1:20:31] that truth
[1:20:33] god is one jehovah not two or three
[1:20:35] jehovah's
[1:20:37] in fact there is there is no such thing
[1:20:39] as two or three jehovah's and there's no
[1:20:42] such thing as one or as as two or three
[1:20:45] lords
[1:20:48] amen one lord one faith one baptism one
[1:20:51] god
[1:20:55] amen listen we to be abraham's seed we
[1:20:58] got to be a one god people
[1:21:02] preaching a one god bible
[1:21:05] amen a one lord truth
[1:21:09] are you with me
[1:21:11] now now mark 12 29 jesus answered him
[1:21:14] the first of all commandments
[1:21:18] here it is the very first foremost
[1:21:21] revelation of god
[1:21:23] is hero israel the lord our god is one
[1:21:28] lord
[1:21:30] and thou shalt love the lord thy god
[1:21:32] with all thy heart with all thy soul and
[1:21:34] with all that mind and with all that
[1:21:36] strength this is the first commandment
[1:21:40] and the second is like namely this thus
[1:21:43] that love thy neighbor is myself there
[1:21:45] is none other commandment greater than
[1:21:48] these
[1:21:50] so these are the greatest commandments
[1:21:52] amen
[1:21:54] now so how can you love the lord your
[1:21:56] god with all your heart
[1:21:58] and then cut him up
[1:22:00] and make him three
[1:22:03] how can you truly love the lord jesus
[1:22:07] and dissect him and deny his deity and
[1:22:10] say he was just a man
[1:22:15] the true revelation of his presence
[1:22:17] would never question the deity of jesus
[1:22:21] christ
[1:22:23] amen
[1:22:24] now so note the appearing to abraham's
[1:22:27] royal seed in the last day here are
[1:22:29] prophetic eyes
[1:22:31] looking out of the door of the church as
[1:22:34] abraham was watching from the tent door
[1:22:37] and he has this epiphany
[1:22:39] he has a manifestation a divine presence
[1:22:44] he has a moment of sudden revelation or
[1:22:47] insight
[1:22:50] now listen now here we come down to the
[1:22:52] end time and the prophet messenger whose
[1:22:56] name ended like abraham's with h.a.m
[1:22:59] are you with me has seven letters like
[1:23:03] abraham
[1:23:04] and was seeking divine revelation
[1:23:07] he was on watch for the appearing
[1:23:11] and i want you to understand he's going
[1:23:13] to be the eyes of the seer that catches
[1:23:17] his appearing
[1:23:18] and the revelation is going to come
[1:23:20] first to the prophet
[1:23:23] so it comes to the church but it comes
[1:23:26] to the seer first
[1:23:28] remember even the message to laodicea is
[1:23:32] to the messenger to the messenger of
[1:23:35] laodicea write these things
[1:23:38] so you see he would write it to the
[1:23:40] messenger to the angel of the church the
[1:23:43] messenger who would give the message to
[1:23:46] the people that's why it was important
[1:23:49] in this day to have a prophet messenger
[1:23:53] because we're here in the last age where
[1:23:55] it's very very important
[1:23:58] for for someone to catch god's appearing
[1:24:02] in the last days otherwise you totally
[1:24:05] miss out on what god is doing
[1:24:10] now
[1:24:11] you know it wouldn't it wouldn't have
[1:24:13] took very much sleep
[1:24:15] it wouldn't take too much closing of the
[1:24:17] eyes
[1:24:19] it wasn't a catch it took too much not
[1:24:21] enough
[1:24:23] for abraham to miss the appearing
[1:24:26] but he was watching
[1:24:29] he was looking he was anticipating
[1:24:32] revelation
[1:24:33] he was realizing this is the last day
[1:24:36] this is the last age this is the last
[1:24:39] times and we must have the full word
[1:24:42] restored or there's not going to be a
[1:24:44] bride going to rapture
[1:24:47] so he's looking for the appearing now
[1:24:49] watch brother adam talked about this in
[1:24:51] message of grace with his eye caught the
[1:24:54] appearing and he said i looked again and
[1:24:57] there it was growing taller and taller
[1:25:00] three rainbows now notice
[1:25:02] once again the prophetic eye
[1:25:05] sees this
[1:25:06] and when he sees it
[1:25:08] he don't make three gods out of these
[1:25:10] rainbows
[1:25:15] he knows there's one god
[1:25:18] and he says i took off my hat
[1:25:20] and i set down my gun
[1:25:22] and i started walking towards it with my
[1:25:24] hands up and it see just something
[1:25:27] seemed to tell me this is close enough
[1:25:29] and i was going to sit down and take my
[1:25:31] boots off that i had on see if i could
[1:25:33] walk a little closer but when i got
[1:25:35] within a few yards of it i seen the
[1:25:37] color of it misting like a fog moving
[1:25:40] around and i stood still a few moments
[1:25:43] and it was coming right out of the top
[1:25:45] of the little mountain and as i watched
[1:25:47] as these three
[1:25:49] one to the right one to the left one in
[1:25:51] the center running down into a bowl like
[1:25:54] whatever what it was was alive it was
[1:25:56] moving it was making motions and i stood
[1:26:00] there it was gray and dawn i just want
[1:26:02] to stop here and say what an appearing
[1:26:08] what an amazing appearing
[1:26:11] the pillar of fire coming down
[1:26:14] and manifests itself and and the colors
[1:26:17] like a rainbow and three
[1:26:20] rainbows they're coming up out of one
[1:26:23] little bowl like a fair at the top of
[1:26:25] the mountain
[1:26:27] and i looked again and i screamed out oh
[1:26:29] god what would you have your servant
[1:26:33] know
[1:26:34] and just then the spear of the lord came
[1:26:36] in and said jesus of the new testament
[1:26:41] is jehovah of the old he only changed
[1:26:44] his mass from spirit to man
[1:26:48] that was confirming of course my message
[1:26:51] of him let me know assured that these 31
[1:26:54] years hadn't been in vain
[1:26:57] hallelujah so again there was the spirit
[1:26:59] of the lord coming in and what was the
[1:27:02] revelation when he saw it it
[1:27:04] disappearing he saw the revelation was
[1:27:07] jesus of the new testament
[1:27:11] is jehovah of the old
[1:27:15] reminds me of when one day i had a
[1:27:18] man come up you know a couple had a
[1:27:20] couple of men come up because he comes
[1:27:23] for two and they were jehovah's witness
[1:27:25] and then knocked on my door and i
[1:27:27] invited the man
[1:27:28] and he said well most people just turn
[1:27:30] us away won't invite us in well i said
[1:27:32] well i'm not afraid of anything you got
[1:27:35] come on in
[1:27:36] so i sat down for a few moments and he
[1:27:39] said i said so you are jehovah's witness
[1:27:41] he said yeah yeah that's what we are i
[1:27:44] said yeah i'm jehovah's witness too
[1:27:47] oh yeah yeah yeah we're all witnesses of
[1:27:49] jehovah aren't we aren't we you know he
[1:27:51] just kind of brushed it off i said no no
[1:27:53] no i'm you misunderstand i'm a real
[1:27:56] jehovah's witness
[1:27:58] i said because jehovah of the old
[1:28:00] testament is the jesus of the new.
[1:28:07] you know
[1:28:09] you know they didn't get nowhere that
[1:28:11] day
[1:28:12] and about a month later they brought a
[1:28:14] whole team about 12 people back with all
[1:28:16] of their
[1:28:17] with their big teacher from little rock
[1:28:19] and he was going to show them how to put
[1:28:21] somebody like me in their place
[1:28:25] and when they left my house they dusted
[1:28:27] their clothes off
[1:28:30] amen they didn't get anywhere
[1:28:32] because it's just like this all you have
[1:28:34] to do is stand right there at that hole
[1:28:36] where the rabbit gets out he's got to
[1:28:39] come right back there
[1:28:41] amen and there is where our revelation
[1:28:44] is that jehovah the old testament is the
[1:28:47] jesus of the new it was only god
[1:28:50] changing his mask
[1:28:54] so here god comes to abraham with a mask
[1:28:57] on
[1:28:58] he has taken cosmic light and dust and
[1:29:00] potassium whatever and he's re and he's
[1:29:03] there he molded and made himself a body
[1:29:06] and he stepped in it
[1:29:08] and it's gonna have some fellowship
[1:29:11] amen he's going to have some fellowship
[1:29:13] with abraham that he's going to do the
[1:29:15] same in this end time
[1:29:16] except this time he uses redeemed bodies
[1:29:20] to reveal himself and have fellowship
[1:29:22] with a bride in this last day
[1:29:25] aren't you glad to be a part of
[1:29:27] abraham's group
[1:29:29] amen that class of people
[1:29:32] so he said when i saw them rainbows
[1:29:35] about as wide across as that halo is of
[1:29:38] the angel lord and there were three of
[1:29:40] them running into one
[1:29:42] how it helped my heart to know that god
[1:29:45] that jesus is not just a man as people
[1:29:48] think he is
[1:29:50] amen
[1:29:52] he
[1:29:53] are just a prophet as this modern idea
[1:29:56] today that thinks jesus was just a
[1:29:58] prophet he is jehovah of the old
[1:30:01] testament made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:30:05] and
[1:30:06] and there that sure did comfort me
[1:30:09] and then thinking on that subject he
[1:30:11] said now there there's a group of people
[1:30:13] calls himself oneness or jesus only i
[1:30:16] don't agree with them and their theory
[1:30:18] neither i did agree with the
[1:30:20] trinitarian group that says that there
[1:30:23] are three different gods the extreme of
[1:30:26] the trinitarian but i believe that the
[1:30:29] three father son and holy ghost is one
[1:30:33] that they are three offices of one god
[1:30:36] he lived in the fatherhood in the pillar
[1:30:38] of fire he lived in the sonship in jesus
[1:30:41] christ he now lives it he lives now in
[1:30:44] the holy ghost in his church so guess
[1:30:48] where he's going to appear at
[1:30:51] he's going to appear in your flesh and
[1:30:53] my flesh
[1:30:54] because that's where he's appearing in
[1:30:57] this last day
[1:30:59] not in a body that he created out here
[1:31:02] of cosmic light and potassium whatever
[1:31:04] steps into it nor in the body that he
[1:31:06] created made in the womb of mary but a
[1:31:10] bride that he has created hallelujah by
[1:31:14] the word birthing the bride into
[1:31:17] existence
[1:31:18] so that god could come down and have
[1:31:21] fellowship with his people
[1:31:24] hallelujah
[1:31:26] now so the same lord jesus that was made
[1:31:29] flesh and dwelt among us is with us this
[1:31:32] day among us in the form of the holy
[1:31:34] spirit
[1:31:35] and all the experiences when i turned
[1:31:38] and seen it thinking first it could be
[1:31:41] the sun beat through a cloud somewhere
[1:31:43] but it was before the sun rose and when
[1:31:46] i turned back and seen it wasn't a light
[1:31:48] it was a rainbows and i looked and seen
[1:31:51] it i became numb all over and someone
[1:31:53] said to me do you feel like shouting no
[1:31:56] he said i didn't feel like shouting
[1:31:58] those experiences never make you feel
[1:32:01] like shouting they just make you feel
[1:32:03] anchored
[1:32:05] just word that you know there's
[1:32:08] something that tells you just a
[1:32:10] satisfied thing
[1:32:13] amen now you see a service like this you
[1:32:16] may not jump up and shout and run the
[1:32:18] aisles but it ought to just give you an
[1:32:20] anchor
[1:32:22] a real satisfied feeling
[1:32:26] that god appearing among us is by
[1:32:29] revelation revealing himself
[1:32:32] hallelujah not as one of three gods or
[1:32:35] one of three persons or not not jesus as
[1:32:39] a a minor god nor jesus as just merely a
[1:32:43] man but jesus the almighty
[1:32:48] now
[1:32:50] he tells you accounts a second time
[1:32:52] and let your light so shine before men
[1:32:55] said i go to the mountains friends it
[1:32:57] isn't so much to go hunting i'm going
[1:32:59] there to get alone with god
[1:33:01] so again he's looking for the appearing
[1:33:05] some of you notice my greatest
[1:33:07] experience as i have is when i'm out
[1:33:09] hunting when i meet god
[1:33:11] out of all my experiences i never had
[1:33:13] one like i had the other morning
[1:33:15] right up going squirrel hunting i i've
[1:33:18] seen many things in my life signs and
[1:33:20] wonders
[1:33:21] and so forth but that struck me stronger
[1:33:24] than anything i've had yet
[1:33:26] oh i pray it strikes us today
[1:33:29] just imagine just about to break a day
[1:33:32] rainy solid cloudy all over see me see
[1:33:35] it standing in front of me rising up
[1:33:38] like from like a couple and sitting on a
[1:33:40] hill sitting there three rainbows rising
[1:33:43] higher and higher until you're so numb
[1:33:45] to you could hardly speak and then walk
[1:33:47] closer and hear him speak and confirm
[1:33:50] the very message that you're preaching
[1:33:51] to be the truth said jesus of the new
[1:33:54] testament is jehovah of the old he just
[1:33:58] changed his veil
[1:34:00] well i said studying that and i find out
[1:34:02] that the very sad the same word that he
[1:34:04] changed his countenance in the in the
[1:34:06] greek did mean change in his mask not
[1:34:09] exactly his veil but his mouth it come
[1:34:12] to the place he was transformed that
[1:34:14] means he changed his way he was jehovah
[1:34:18] god and jehovah god jehovah changed
[1:34:20] himself from spirit and became a man and
[1:34:24] he's the same jehovah god which was the
[1:34:27] father and this is the son being the
[1:34:29] same person
[1:34:32] so there's not three persons of god
[1:34:34] after all here are there
[1:34:36] amen
[1:34:38] now abraham had this epiphany
[1:34:41] paul had this same sudden appearing
[1:34:46] that brought revelation to him
[1:34:49] so here abraham has an epi epiphany and
[1:34:53] paul gets the same epiphany
[1:34:56] he has the same revelation
[1:34:59] there is an appearing to paul the
[1:35:01] prophet of the first age to make him
[1:35:05] know for sure
[1:35:07] before he got started on anything
[1:35:10] who jesus is
[1:35:13] because it is the foundational
[1:35:16] fundamental truth
[1:35:18] that we that the church is built upon
[1:35:21] and when they're built solid upon that
[1:35:23] the gates of hell will not prevail
[1:35:26] against it
[1:35:29] amen now let me tell you something
[1:35:31] friends you can find fault with brother
[1:35:33] branham's character you can try to
[1:35:35] assassinate his character you can say
[1:35:37] this and this and this about it but what
[1:35:40] we are preaching and what we believe is
[1:35:43] not about him it's about who jesus is
[1:35:47] and in jesus is the seals and jesus is
[1:35:50] the mystery in jesus is everything and
[1:35:53] jesus is a bride you are in jesus and
[1:35:56] jesus is in you
[1:35:58] and because of that i don't care what
[1:36:01] they say they can come up with every
[1:36:03] kind of accusation against the prophet
[1:36:06] of god but i this revelation is who
[1:36:09] jesus is and when he made known to who
[1:36:13] jesus is he may know to me who i am
[1:36:19] hallelujah because that's what he did to
[1:36:21] peter when peter got the revelation of
[1:36:24] who jesus was and he said and i say unto
[1:36:26] you
[1:36:28] that thou art peter
[1:36:32] you're a stone too
[1:36:35] amen and on this rock
[1:36:38] amen
[1:36:39] i'm going to build my church
[1:36:41] and i'm going to start with the
[1:36:42] foundation of apostles and prophets
[1:36:45] with jesus christ being the first
[1:36:47] cornerstone
[1:36:49] all right
[1:36:50] so on this foundation i'll build my
[1:36:52] church now when you are built there
[1:36:55] solidly in the message in the bible the
[1:36:58] gates of hell cannot prevail against you
[1:37:02] that's why these stains none of these
[1:37:04] things move me
[1:37:09] none of the conflict none of the
[1:37:11] arguments none of the things
[1:37:14] i just say this to some of them out
[1:37:16] there what have you got better to offer
[1:37:18] me than what i got
[1:37:21] it changed my life
[1:37:23] it saved my soul
[1:37:25] it put holiness in the church come on
[1:37:28] amen it took out sin and ungodliness
[1:37:32] it gave me a happy wonderful marriage it
[1:37:35] gave me four wonderful children and many
[1:37:37] grandchildren
[1:37:39] amen it gave me a church full of
[1:37:41] believers
[1:37:43] whose i'm not going and cleaning after
[1:37:45] them all the time and changing their
[1:37:47] diapers
[1:37:49] but because they've got a hold of the
[1:37:51] rock
[1:37:52] that they're build upon
[1:37:54] amen they don't have to be bottled and
[1:37:56] cared for like that but they can be
[1:37:58] adult sons and daughters of god who know
[1:38:01] how to believe when crisis arise
[1:38:08] paul got the same revelation
[1:38:10] that's what he
[1:38:12] that brought him in his epiphany
[1:38:15] he was a jew
[1:38:16] and he was acquainted with the pillar of
[1:38:18] fire he had heard about it
[1:38:20] amen it had been the very thing that had
[1:38:22] led his people out of egypt
[1:38:25] they followed this pillar of fire
[1:38:27] and when he saw that pillar of fire when
[1:38:29] the appearance came to paul
[1:38:31] he asked the question who art thou lord
[1:38:34] now the first revelation paul gets
[1:38:38] is who jesus is
[1:38:45] now you know a lot of you come to christ
[1:38:48] and you know you think it's all about me
[1:38:50] and lord i'm the sinner and i'm this and
[1:38:52] it's my problems that that's not the
[1:38:55] revelation you you get the revelation
[1:38:57] who jesus is
[1:39:00] when you know him
[1:39:03] is life
[1:39:07] understand that get your eyes on jesus
[1:39:11] you get your eyes on yourself and your
[1:39:13] faults and your problems and
[1:39:15] how bad a sinner you have been and what
[1:39:17] you you'll never get salvation look at
[1:39:19] jesus
[1:39:20] he is savior if he can't save you who
[1:39:22] can
[1:39:25] it's impossible for you to be saved
[1:39:28] without him
[1:39:30] so go ahead and get that verse
[1:39:32] revelation who jesus is he's almighty
[1:39:37] god and when he says you're forgiven
[1:39:41] you are forgiven
[1:39:44] when he pardons you you are pardoned
[1:39:49] your sins and your iniquities i'll
[1:39:51] remember them no more
[1:39:55] now this is paul he's on the road to
[1:39:57] damascus he meets the pillar of fire he
[1:39:59] has an epiphany he's cheese he sees the
[1:40:02] appearing of the lord
[1:40:04] and here he appears
[1:40:06] as a pillar of fire
[1:40:08] and him being a jew
[1:40:10] he knew that was god
[1:40:12] so he said who art thou lord
[1:40:16] and he
[1:40:17] he knew him as lord but who are you
[1:40:19] and the voice came back from the pillar
[1:40:21] of fire and said i am jesus
[1:40:27] and it's hard for you to kick against
[1:40:28] the priests now from that time on paul
[1:40:32] knew that the jehovah of the old
[1:40:35] testament was the jesus of the new.
[1:40:40] this is why he could preach the godhead
[1:40:43] and all the other revelations because it
[1:40:46] all began with that foundational truth
[1:40:51] now brother branham tells us in voice of
[1:40:53] the sign and what's it the sign has a
[1:40:55] voice
[1:40:57] so again you know the that's what he was
[1:41:00] trying to make clear there's a message
[1:41:02] that is coming with a sign the sign
[1:41:04] was showing your name is so-and-so and
[1:41:06] you're from so and so and
[1:41:08] discerning the heart like it did in
[1:41:10] sarah in the tent behind him
[1:41:12] right amen so that was a sign but there
[1:41:15] was a voice with design
[1:41:18] and the voice is making known first
[1:41:21] god's deity
[1:41:24] all right same way with paul he had the
[1:41:26] sign
[1:41:28] you believe he was a prophet
[1:41:30] so what kind of sign did he see a pillar
[1:41:32] of fire
[1:41:34] amen
[1:41:35] and on the road to damascus you know
[1:41:38] jesus had died crucified and rose and
[1:41:41] descended into heaven paul's on his road
[1:41:43] to damascus when a great light struck
[1:41:46] him down and he says lord who are you
[1:41:53] and he said i'm jesus
[1:41:55] then he was told you're a chosen vessel
[1:41:58] i'll tell you when he reveals to you who
[1:42:00] he is
[1:42:02] you are from then on a chosen vessel
[1:42:06] actually you were chosen before that but
[1:42:09] you come to realize you were chosen
[1:42:13] hallelujah
[1:42:14] no notice what did paul had the rest of
[1:42:16] them didn't have he had abundance of
[1:42:18] revelation
[1:42:20] of the word of god because but it was
[1:42:23] paul who recognized that jesus in the
[1:42:25] new testament was the jehovah of the old
[1:42:28] testament
[1:42:29] and brother brandon says hallelujah i
[1:42:31] could say something here he had a
[1:42:32] revelation of he wrote it and revealed
[1:42:34] it because god permitted it to be added
[1:42:37] to the bible and the word only comes by
[1:42:41] the bible by the prophet so then god
[1:42:45] revealed to paul he wrote the letters
[1:42:47] inspired god put them in the bible oh my
[1:42:50] revealed christ
[1:42:52] that he is christ of the old testament
[1:42:54] because he met him
[1:42:56] he couldn't understand how that pillar
[1:42:58] of fire was that one that led this
[1:43:00] people out of egypt that one that had
[1:43:02] been with the hebrews all down to the
[1:43:04] age and here he is he's seen him and he
[1:43:06] said lord what is it you want with me
[1:43:09] i'm jesus
[1:43:11] and he's seen this one that had led his
[1:43:13] people that moses met that i am the ever
[1:43:17] present the same yesterday today and
[1:43:19] forever
[1:43:20] was now manifested in the flesh and it
[1:43:23] was his revelation
[1:43:25] and he added above all the others
[1:43:27] because he saw him after his death
[1:43:30] burial resurrection and ascension
[1:43:33] and then he had descended in the holy
[1:43:35] ghost and it was appearing to the people
[1:43:38] in the form of a pillar of fire
[1:43:41] and in this appearing he's revealing i
[1:43:45] am jesus
[1:43:49] amen
[1:43:51] now because of this great revelation of
[1:43:53] course to keep him humble the messenger
[1:43:55] of satan was allowed to buffet him
[1:43:58] but what he do to his revelation
[1:44:01] now
[1:44:02] i want to quote this from brother
[1:44:03] branham
[1:44:04] his revelation then was a prophecy for
[1:44:07] today
[1:44:09] think of that
[1:44:11] it was a voice coming forth
[1:44:13] wrote in the bible to be vindicated
[1:44:16] today again hallelujah is the voice
[1:44:19] being vindicated again what he wrote
[1:44:21] because he was god's prophet revealing
[1:44:24] the sign was speaking of something so
[1:44:27] you see the voice of the sign revealed
[1:44:30] to paul that the jehovah the old
[1:44:32] testament is the jesus of the new
[1:44:36] and of course that was a prophecy that
[1:44:39] in the last day
[1:44:41] there would be an omega people who would
[1:44:44] get the same revelation again
[1:44:49] now so the end time messenger is to the
[1:44:52] last stage we'll have to preach the same
[1:44:54] that paul preached
[1:44:57] amen before brother branham preaches the
[1:44:59] church ages
[1:45:00] before his first sermon
[1:45:03] of the series and he begins it he begins
[1:45:06] it with the revelation of jesus christ
[1:45:09] so i want you to understand as the
[1:45:10] mysteries begin to break
[1:45:12] it begins with the revelation of jesus
[1:45:16] christ
[1:45:18] because from that revelation all the
[1:45:21] others are going to burst forth
[1:45:23] and if you don't get that one right
[1:45:25] you're not going to get the rest of it
[1:45:27] right
[1:45:29] and if you get confused come back to
[1:45:31] this truth
[1:45:34] amen now so the end time messenger his
[1:45:38] first sermon
[1:45:39] as the word is being revealed to him the
[1:45:42] church ages are being made no it's
[1:45:44] messenger the first sermon he preaches
[1:45:46] is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:45:50] and he preaches in that sermon of the
[1:45:52] supreme deity of the lord jesus christ
[1:45:55] make it known that jesus is no mere
[1:45:58] prophet
[1:45:59] but the god prophet no mere man but the
[1:46:02] god man no junior god but the almighty
[1:46:06] god
[1:46:09] so let's go to the beginning of
[1:46:11] revelation where everything starts
[1:46:13] unfolding
[1:46:14] because the book of revelation is our
[1:46:17] book
[1:46:20] it was it was written
[1:46:22] it was written even after apostle paul
[1:46:24] was dead and john's on the isle of
[1:46:26] patmos and god leaves this righteous and
[1:46:28] simple form and so much of it is
[1:46:31] in symbol because it's not to be made
[1:46:34] known until the appearing in the last
[1:46:36] day and then they appear in the last day
[1:46:38] there'll be a prophet
[1:46:39] sitting in the tent in the church
[1:46:42] watching for that appearing to reveal
[1:46:45] these mysteries
[1:46:48] so that it would no longer be symbol
[1:46:50] because it wasn't needed for them but
[1:46:53] it's needed for you
[1:46:55] so the book of revelation is your book
[1:47:02] so now you're in the alpha book
[1:47:04] book of genesis
[1:47:06] and now you're over here in the omega
[1:47:08] book
[1:47:09] the book of revelation
[1:47:13] and when you get down to the book of
[1:47:15] revelation in many ways it's about two
[1:47:17] women
[1:47:20] it's about
[1:47:22] a spotless bride
[1:47:27] and an awful
[1:47:35] think of that
[1:47:39] and so in that last of that book
[1:47:42] he's going to reveal things
[1:47:44] to this last age
[1:47:46] that the other ages wasn't privy to know
[1:47:50] and the reason for it is in the last
[1:47:52] ages the age of his coming
[1:47:55] where the appearing will
[1:47:58] will move into
[1:48:00] his coming this will be the climax of
[1:48:03] the appearing
[1:48:04] when we meet him in the air
[1:48:07] so it begins with abraham revealing to
[1:48:11] him the mysteries
[1:48:13] and to him he sees there is one lord
[1:48:18] and begins with that foundational truth
[1:48:21] and now he'll understand what happens
[1:48:23] with lot he'll have what happens to
[1:48:25] sodomite he'll understand what his
[1:48:27] promise of his change of sarah's new
[1:48:30] name of his name all of these mysteries
[1:48:33] are truths that are laying there and
[1:48:35] disappearing
[1:48:38] now so the end time messenger will have
[1:48:41] to preach the same thing that paul does
[1:48:43] so he comes there and he starts
[1:48:45] because it's prophesying the alpha
[1:48:48] church has to also be the same as the
[1:48:52] omega church right i said that backwards
[1:48:54] the omega church has to be the same as
[1:48:56] alpha church because he is alpha and
[1:48:58] omega so revelation 1 8 it starts right
[1:49:02] here in the book of revelation 1 8 i am
[1:49:05] alpha and omega so the first thing god
[1:49:08] wants to do in the revelation of jesus
[1:49:11] christ is make known who he is
[1:49:15] i am alpha and omega
[1:49:18] i am the beginning
[1:49:20] and the ending
[1:49:22] i was in genesis and i'll be in
[1:49:24] revelation
[1:49:25] i was in the first time in the first age
[1:49:28] in the sea chapter and i'll be there in
[1:49:30] the harvest time
[1:49:35] i am alpha omega the beginning the end
[1:49:37] and saith the lord which is
[1:49:39] which was and which is to come
[1:49:42] the almighty
[1:49:44] now if he was reading this in your red
[1:49:46] letter bible you would see this is jesus
[1:49:49] saying this
[1:49:50] he is saying i am alpha and omega
[1:49:54] i am the beginning and the indian saint
[1:49:57] the lord
[1:49:58] i am that which was which is
[1:50:01] which is which was and which is to come
[1:50:03] in other words the same yesterday
[1:50:06] which was
[1:50:08] which is today and forever which is to
[1:50:11] come the almighty i'm the same yesterday
[1:50:14] today and wherever i am the almighty
[1:50:18] remember if you miss that key
[1:50:21] that he is the same in every detail
[1:50:25] except his mask
[1:50:29] his corporal body
[1:50:33] if you miss that truth that
[1:50:35] understanding then you miss who jesus is
[1:50:38] and what he's doing
[1:50:40] now brother branham tells us in the
[1:50:42] revelation of jesus christ remember this
[1:50:44] is what he's preaching revealing jesus
[1:50:46] christ and he says what is he trying to
[1:50:49] put before the church he's trying to
[1:50:51] show his deity
[1:50:53] today they want to make him a prophet
[1:50:55] he's more than a prophet
[1:50:58] and some people try to make him three
[1:50:59] gods he's not three gods
[1:51:02] he is one god that lived in three
[1:51:04] offices are three manifestations of the
[1:51:07] same god
[1:51:09] remember this is a book of revelation
[1:51:12] and it and he said whosoever heareth it
[1:51:14] and don't keep the saying
[1:51:16] of this book his part
[1:51:18] will be taken from the book of life
[1:51:21] so brother branham is warning us there
[1:51:23] he said the book of revelation once if
[1:51:26] you do not
[1:51:28] hear and keep these sins
[1:51:32] you see you've got to keep the godhead
[1:51:34] straight
[1:51:36] if you mix it up
[1:51:38] your part's taken out of the book of
[1:51:40] life
[1:51:41] you're identified with either lord or
[1:51:43] the sodomites
[1:51:47] all right
[1:51:48] so now jesus not revealing himself as
[1:51:50] three god but one god in three offices
[1:51:54] and then that evening he takes the
[1:51:56] patmos vision where john's on the isle
[1:51:58] of patmos and he's talking about the
[1:52:01] appearing of god
[1:52:02] to john and john is described he's
[1:52:05] writing down his appearing and this is
[1:52:08] going to be prophetical because his
[1:52:10] appearance prophetical of the appearing
[1:52:13] in the last day remember it's all
[1:52:15] prophecy
[1:52:16] and you are the interpretation amen
[1:52:23] now
[1:52:24] this morning said we took the supreme
[1:52:27] deity of
[1:52:29] the revelation of jesus christ who god
[1:52:31] revealed to him as supreme deity the
[1:52:34] great i am not i was or will be i am
[1:52:37] always
[1:52:39] notice in the first chapter of
[1:52:40] revelation what's the revelation of
[1:52:42] jesus christ what is the first thing he
[1:52:45] reveals himself here as the god of
[1:52:47] heaven not a triune god but one god
[1:52:50] one god he reveals himself the same same
[1:52:52] way in the first
[1:52:54] of the of revelation and it and it
[1:52:56] speaks it four times in the first
[1:52:58] chapter so that there will not be
[1:53:01] a mistake the first thing you got to
[1:53:04] know that he is not a prophet he's not a
[1:53:07] junior god he's not a secondary god he
[1:53:10] is god
[1:53:13] so that's the first thing you've got to
[1:53:15] know
[1:53:16] who is disappearing
[1:53:18] it's god appearing
[1:53:22] now four times in the in the first
[1:53:25] chapter he does this so you don't miss
[1:53:28] it the prelude to all the other
[1:53:31] revelations
[1:53:32] i don't want you to miss this this is
[1:53:34] the key
[1:53:37] it is the key of revelations
[1:53:41] revelation 1 4 john to the seven church
[1:53:44] churches which are in asia grace me unto
[1:53:46] you and peace
[1:53:48] from him which is and which was and
[1:53:51] which is to come and from the seven
[1:53:54] spirits which are before his throne
[1:53:57] and then verse eight i am alpha and
[1:54:00] omega
[1:54:01] the beginning and the ending saith the
[1:54:04] lord which is which was and which is to
[1:54:07] come the almighty and then verse 11 i am
[1:54:11] alpha and omega the first and the last
[1:54:14] what the seals write in a book send it
[1:54:16] to the seven churches which are in asia
[1:54:18] to ephesus smyrna pergamus tytara
[1:54:21] philadelphia to laodicea
[1:54:24] to the end of the ages you see he will
[1:54:27] be the first
[1:54:28] and the last
[1:54:30] the alpha
[1:54:31] for you young people that means alpha is
[1:54:34] the first letter of the greek alphabet
[1:54:37] omega is the last
[1:54:40] so he says i am first
[1:54:42] and i am the last
[1:54:44] and at the end aged by the prophet
[1:54:47] seventh messenger that seer amen god
[1:54:51] will be known as the omega in the
[1:54:54] beginning he was the alpha in the end
[1:54:57] he's omega but whatever he was in the
[1:54:59] beginning that's what he is in the end
[1:55:02] who he was in the beginning
[1:55:04] is the same that he is i am the lord thy
[1:55:07] god that changes not
[1:55:10] amen now so we can put that principle to
[1:55:14] everything
[1:55:15] if it's healing we know we need that
[1:55:18] whatever he was yesterday he's the
[1:55:20] healer today
[1:55:22] amen for salvation that we need amen he
[1:55:25] is savior today whatever he was is what
[1:55:28] he is
[1:55:31] whatever his attitude was toward the
[1:55:33] sick 2 000 years ago is his attitude
[1:55:37] toward you that are sick this morning he
[1:55:40] is the healer of all diseases he was
[1:55:43] willing to make stripes for you your
[1:55:46] punishment so that by those punishments
[1:55:49] you could be healed
[1:55:53] verse 17 and when i saw him i fell at
[1:55:55] his feet as dead and he laid his right
[1:55:58] hand upon me saying fear not i am the
[1:56:00] first and the last he that liveth and
[1:56:03] was dead and behold i am alive
[1:56:05] forevermore amen and i have the keys of
[1:56:08] hell and death
[1:56:12] so the first book
[1:56:14] of the bible
[1:56:15] the alpha book
[1:56:17] begins like this
[1:56:19] genesis 1 1
[1:56:21] in the beginning
[1:56:23] god
[1:56:25] so he's the beginning
[1:56:28] and then the gospels begin
[1:56:32] with saint john bringing it out the
[1:56:33] beginning of
[1:56:35] john brings it like this in the
[1:56:37] beginning was the word
[1:56:43] so you see the last book of the bible
[1:56:47] the omega book
[1:56:49] now look it begins like this revelation
[1:56:52] revelation 1 1. watch now hear the last
[1:56:55] book of the bible first book of the
[1:56:57] bible begins like this in beginning god
[1:57:00] the first of the gospels begin like this
[1:57:03] in the beginning was the word
[1:57:05] they met the last book of the bible
[1:57:07] begins like this the revelation of jesus
[1:57:11] christ
[1:57:12] for
[1:57:13] jesus christ is the revelation of god
[1:57:19] now
[1:57:19] so in the in the pakmas vision
[1:57:22] there's one standing forth and his voice
[1:57:24] is like a trumpet
[1:57:26] in disappearing he knows someone is
[1:57:28] coming
[1:57:30] now remember this is all is appearing
[1:57:32] that we're preaching about and in this
[1:57:34] appearing
[1:57:35] there's there's a trumpet that is
[1:57:37] sounding a voice like a trumpet
[1:57:39] and it's somebody approaching it's a
[1:57:41] great one approaching
[1:57:43] somebody's coming
[1:57:46] hallelujah and he says i am alpha and
[1:57:49] omega
[1:57:50] the first and the last
[1:57:53] notice he's not announcing a second
[1:57:55] party or third party but the only party
[1:58:00] amen before i show you anything he says
[1:58:03] i want you to know i'm alpha and omega
[1:58:06] and i will before i show you anything i
[1:58:08] want you to know who i am
[1:58:12] so the greatest of all revelations is
[1:58:15] the supreme deity
[1:58:17] of our lord jesus christ
[1:58:20] amen you can't get first base
[1:58:23] until you believe that
[1:58:25] repent if you repent you'll see the
[1:58:27] deity
[1:58:30] amen come on if you repent you'll
[1:58:33] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:58:34] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:58:37] jesus christ for remission of sin
[1:58:40] know who it is that the deity that
[1:58:42] you're being baptized
[1:58:45] in his name
[1:58:47] so you repent
[1:58:49] you can't get the first base as a
[1:58:52] christian without first repenting of
[1:58:54] your sins
[1:58:56] and then repenting of your sins you'll
[1:58:58] see the deity you'll receive the gift of
[1:59:01] the holy ghost
[1:59:03] are you with me now so in and and you
[1:59:06] will take on the name of jesus christ or
[1:59:09] the name of the deity that you are
[1:59:12] worshiping
[1:59:15] hallelujah that's why we baptize in his
[1:59:18] name
[1:59:19] because there is no salvation
[1:59:23] in any other name than the name of jesus
[1:59:25] christ
[1:59:29] so the first thing you've got to know
[1:59:31] even as a christian is the the deity of
[1:59:33] christ i'm alpha and omega
[1:59:35] i am a to c
[1:59:37] there's no more but me
[1:59:39] i was at the beginning i'll be at the
[1:59:41] end
[1:59:42] he that was which is shall come the
[1:59:45] almighty amen that's what the trumpet is
[1:59:48] announcing
[1:59:49] as the appearance begins we're talking
[1:59:51] about revelation 1.
[1:59:53] so you know
[1:59:55] john is entered into the spirit
[1:59:57] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[2:00:00] what was happening he was going to
[2:00:02] something was going to be revealed to
[2:00:04] him
[2:00:05] and he says the trumpet sounds i'm off
[2:00:08] and omega first of all revelation
[2:00:10] first thing that he lets him know
[2:00:12] that approaching his king jesus
[2:00:17] amen
[2:00:18] i
[2:00:19] just king jesus or king god or
[2:00:22] king father or king holy ghost i'm all
[2:00:24] of it
[2:00:26] i am i'm a to z
[2:00:30] i'm the beginning and the ending i'm the
[2:00:33] immortal the eternal one
[2:00:35] this is what he's saying
[2:00:38] now so watch him now you know all the
[2:00:40] way down through as as he reveals
[2:00:43] himself in the in this now that we come
[2:00:45] down to just before the last age and
[2:00:49] then the philadelphian age
[2:00:52] he comes and he says
[2:00:54] he he begins to reveal himself again
[2:00:58] in in the alpha church in the omega
[2:01:00] church
[2:01:02] in the omega church he reveals the
[2:01:04] supreme deity of christ
[2:01:07] in the alpha church in the omega church
[2:01:10] he's going to do the same thing
[2:01:12] so look right here in revelation 3 and 7
[2:01:16] as we approach
[2:01:17] the last age
[2:01:20] look what he says and to the angel of
[2:01:22] the church in philadelphia write these
[2:01:24] things say that he that is holy he that
[2:01:26] is true he that hath the key of david he
[2:01:29] that openeth no man shouted to shutteth
[2:01:31] and no man over there i knoweth thy
[2:01:32] words behold i have set before thee an
[2:01:35] open door and no man can shut it
[2:01:39] so he says right here
[2:01:42] right here now i'm sitting before you
[2:01:46] just as they entered into the last
[2:01:49] church age
[2:01:50] before the last churches dawns or opens
[2:01:54] he said it is a door open
[2:01:58] and this open door is going to be
[2:02:02] is going to be this a door that no man
[2:02:05] can shut
[2:02:08] i want you to know the revelation of
[2:02:10] jesus christ the gates of hell cannot
[2:02:14] prevail against it
[2:02:16] i want you to understand that that the
[2:02:18] truth of the godhead there's not enough
[2:02:21] devils in hell that will ever be able to
[2:02:24] shut the door to that truth
[2:02:29] because he said when i open it
[2:02:31] no man touch it
[2:02:33] and now the truth of god has been lost
[2:02:36] down to the ages but he promises it will
[2:02:39] be restored in the last age
[2:02:42] by opening the door who is the door
[2:02:45] christ is that door
[2:02:47] so open up who he is the revelation of
[2:02:50] who he is so the last age gets the
[2:02:53] revelation
[2:02:57] hallelujah and in that revelation all
[2:02:59] mysteries are revealed and finished up
[2:03:03] to produce a bride in the last day
[2:03:06] of people created by the word of god
[2:03:09] hallelujah so that open door is this is
[2:03:13] the revelation of the supreme deity not
[2:03:16] being the second person of the trinity
[2:03:18] but god himself made flesh and dwelling
[2:03:21] among us and let me say again nobody can
[2:03:24] shut this door once he opens it to the
[2:03:27] elect
[2:03:29] the elect will not be deceived
[2:03:32] oh you might fool them for a while but
[2:03:34] once god opens the door revelation no
[2:03:36] man can shut it
[2:03:38] somebody else can come along and feed
[2:03:40] you sermon after sermon
[2:03:42] you know of two lords and two jehovah's
[2:03:44] and three three gods and ephedra sermon
[2:03:47] after sermon or that but let me tell you
[2:03:50] if god ever opened the door
[2:03:53] of revelation to you
[2:03:55] you'll never be able to stomach that
[2:03:57] stuff
[2:03:59] you'll sit there and say huh i can't
[2:04:01] figure out what he's saying where is he
[2:04:02] going with this what's he saying about
[2:04:04] that i don't know where that means
[2:04:06] because as he left you cannot be
[2:04:09] deceived
[2:04:10] amen a warning buzzer goes off and lets
[2:04:13] you know that's wrong
[2:04:18] now think of this
[2:04:20] men have tried to make jesus one of the
[2:04:22] three persons of a trinity
[2:04:25] of gods
[2:04:26] but there is one lord
[2:04:29] one faith
[2:04:30] one baptism
[2:04:32] look how the church is divided along
[2:04:34] this line you see this divides the
[2:04:37] church and the elect group
[2:04:40] so in his first chapter of revelation he
[2:04:43] reveals his supreme deity
[2:04:46] because his church is going to be built
[2:04:49] upon the divine revelation of himself
[2:04:52] that's matthew 16 18 remember he says on
[2:04:55] this rock i'll build my church
[2:04:59] his whole church is built on the
[2:05:01] revelation of himself now you know a lot
[2:05:03] of people have taken it the catholics
[2:05:06] said it was built upon peter so he was
[2:05:08] the first pope
[2:05:10] and then the protestants said no it was
[2:05:11] on christ because
[2:05:13] that's who it's built it's on the
[2:05:15] revelation of who jesus is
[2:05:20] so the church is built on that
[2:05:22] revelation of god
[2:05:24] now and when you're built there
[2:05:27] the gates of hell can never prevail
[2:05:30] against you
[2:05:32] that's why i said you repent you see the
[2:05:34] deity
[2:05:35] amen you receive the holy ghost you're
[2:05:37] baptized in his name you receive the
[2:05:39] holy ghost then the gates of hell will
[2:05:41] not prevail against you
[2:05:44] i'll tell you what if i can get our
[2:05:46] young people if we can get our young
[2:05:48] people filled with the holy ghost you'll
[2:05:50] never have to worry about pornography
[2:05:54] you'll never have to worry about
[2:05:55] fornication you'll never have to worry
[2:05:58] about drinking and smoking
[2:06:00] because when their faith when they are
[2:06:03] built on that revelation of who jesus is
[2:06:07] hallelujah and the first thing all you
[2:06:09] ought to know he's my god
[2:06:12] he's not my daddy's god he's not my
[2:06:14] neighbor's god he's not just their god
[2:06:16] he's my god my lord god is jehovah and
[2:06:20] only him will i serve
[2:06:26] so you see it's the supreme deity of
[2:06:28] jesus christ and no one can stop that
[2:06:30] message
[2:06:32] no one can not it can stop that message
[2:06:35] of the supreme deity in baptism in the
[2:06:37] name of jesus christ the gates of hell
[2:06:40] will never prevail against it
[2:06:42] that's why i say some of you question
[2:06:44] the message some people are maybe you're
[2:06:46] listening to me today and your question
[2:06:48] the message go back to the rock
[2:06:54] go back to the foundational stone
[2:06:57] go back who is jesus
[2:07:01] you know once you get that revelation
[2:07:03] you can never swallow three gods again
[2:07:08] you can never go with two lords again
[2:07:11] you can never go and just make jesus
[2:07:13] like the jehovah's witness and the and
[2:07:15] the and the um the
[2:07:18] the others do the mormons do that just
[2:07:20] makes him a minor minor god an elder
[2:07:23] brother but not truly god
[2:07:26] you'll never do it you can never do it
[2:07:28] you can never go back you'll give you go
[2:07:30] back to the rock
[2:07:32] that's what we're preaching on this this
[2:07:34] morning go back to the rock the
[2:07:36] foundational truth of who jesus is
[2:07:42] now see when the angel comes in the last
[2:07:44] day he has to have the same message paul
[2:07:46] had
[2:07:47] if he comes along and he preaches
[2:07:49] something different he's accursed
[2:07:51] is that right so he'll preach the
[2:07:53] baptism in jesus name he'll preach one
[2:07:56] god
[2:07:57] not two or two lords
[2:08:00] amen and you know again he'll preach
[2:08:02] circumcision of the heart he'll preach
[2:08:04] divine miracles he will he'll preach
[2:08:06] divine workings workings of power like
[2:08:08] they had on the day of pentecost the
[2:08:10] very original blessed pentecostal
[2:08:12] blessing will come back to that little
[2:08:14] remnant to take it up yonder
[2:08:17] hallelujah that's what the last
[2:08:19] messenger will do he will be an omega
[2:08:22] messenger like paul was an alpha
[2:08:25] now jesus said he'd have a church
[2:08:28] that that the revelation that was built
[2:08:31] on revelation
[2:08:34] now the great main revelation i'm just
[2:08:37] going this again
[2:08:39] always is who
[2:08:40] jesus christ is
[2:08:44] the book of revelation which is a
[2:08:46] revelation of jesus christ opens the
[2:08:48] same way showing the deity of jesus
[2:08:51] christ his supreme deity
[2:08:53] it's the first of all revelations now
[2:08:56] watch
[2:08:57] in this last day appearing
[2:09:00] now john when he is appearing he he sees
[2:09:03] him
[2:09:04] and he says see seven spirits before his
[2:09:07] throne
[2:09:08] right
[2:09:09] seven angels
[2:09:12] we come to this last day and seven
[2:09:14] angels was his wig
[2:09:18] representing the seven spirits of god
[2:09:20] which is just seven manifestations of
[2:09:22] the one holy spirit
[2:09:25] amen
[2:09:27] of the spirit of god for every age
[2:09:30] and here we see a cloud
[2:09:33] in the skies and it's showing when it's
[2:09:35] turned right
[2:09:36] when it's turned right what does it do
[2:09:39] it shows us what uh
[2:09:42] there that he is christ is veiled with a
[2:09:45] cloud
[2:09:47] amen and that white cloud was his wig
[2:09:51] with the angels being his wig
[2:09:54] come on now
[2:09:55] what was this doing now it was showing
[2:09:57] us now the supreme deity of jesus christ
[2:10:02] and that's what brother branham said
[2:10:04] when when he saw that he said i saw that
[2:10:07] wig he's supreme judge
[2:10:09] look at this like the judges in england
[2:10:12] or our older judges you know might be a
[2:10:14] young man that's a judge but before he
[2:10:16] sat on on the on the judgment seat he
[2:10:19] put on a wig
[2:10:21] he put on a mask
[2:10:23] a wig
[2:10:24] and when that wig was white and it was
[2:10:27] showing age and showing authority
[2:10:30] god was showing to you in the heavens
[2:10:32] the supreme authority of his word
[2:10:35] hallelujah and this supreme deity that
[2:10:38] his supreme judge are you with me he
[2:10:42] said he is supreme judge there is none
[2:10:45] other about him and that is a perfect
[2:10:47] identification again a vindication that
[2:10:50] this message is the truth this is the
[2:10:53] truth and making him not a third person
[2:10:57] but the only person
[2:11:02] amen
[2:11:03] again he talks about this and the what's
[2:11:06] attraction on the mountain he said see
[2:11:09] the supreme deity supreme deity no other
[2:11:12] voice no other god no other nothing in
[2:11:15] him dwells the fullness of the godhead
[2:11:18] bodily and the angels themselves was his
[2:11:21] wig
[2:11:23] brother branham preaches a sermon of
[2:11:25] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[2:11:28] remember the mystery of god is christ
[2:11:33] so when he preaches he said it's one god
[2:11:36] expressed in three attributes
[2:11:38] to be father to be savior to be a son to
[2:11:42] be healer his expressions
[2:11:44] god expressed in jesus christ who was
[2:11:47] who was both father son and holy ghost
[2:11:50] the fullness of the godhead
[2:11:52] bodily
[2:11:54] now i'm happy to announce this part now
[2:11:57] the complete fullness of the godhead
[2:11:59] bodily dwells in his church
[2:12:03] all that god was he poured into the
[2:12:05] church and all that christ was
[2:12:08] was poured into christ and all that
[2:12:09] christ was is poured in the church the
[2:12:11] believers
[2:12:13] so jesus
[2:12:14] was not the second person of god
[2:12:17] he was the person of god
[2:12:21] who is jesus christ he is the full
[2:12:24] manifested god
[2:12:26] that's who he is the the church is built
[2:12:29] upon that rock the full manifestation of
[2:12:32] god not a father son holy ghost and him
[2:12:35] being the second person but on this rock
[2:12:37] of who he is
[2:12:39] amen a revelation of jesus christ note
[2:12:42] the bride church is built
[2:12:45] on that
[2:12:46] rock that revelation of who jesus is
[2:12:51] the revelation of christ of who christ
[2:12:54] is then is our foundational stone
[2:12:58] that the church is built upon
[2:13:02] amen and anointed once at the end time
[2:13:05] he said i was talking to a gentleman
[2:13:07] a christian scholar a gentleman
[2:13:11] mr branham we refuse all revelation i
[2:13:14] said then you have to refuse jesus
[2:13:16] christ
[2:13:18] for he is the revelation of god god
[2:13:21] revealed in human flesh
[2:13:23] unless you see it you're lost
[2:13:28] jesus said except you believe i am he
[2:13:30] you will die in your sins he is the
[2:13:33] revelation of god the spirit of god
[2:13:35] revealed in human form if you believe
[2:13:37] that if you can't believe that you're
[2:13:40] lost you put him a third person second
[2:13:42] person or any other person beside god
[2:13:45] you are lost except you believe i am he
[2:13:49] you'll die in your sins now you see why
[2:13:52] this is so important
[2:13:54] and you see now why the devil wants to
[2:13:56] get you off that rock because if he can
[2:13:59] get you on that rock that's where he has
[2:14:01] off that rock he'll have you defeated
[2:14:03] now as god's prophet he unveils that god
[2:14:09] so he preaches a sermon the unveiling of
[2:14:12] god
[2:14:13] remember we're talking about the
[2:14:15] appearing the epiphany and in the
[2:14:17] appearance he's going to unveil that god
[2:14:20] this is what abraham does he looks out
[2:14:22] and he sees three men but he only knows
[2:14:24] there's only one god
[2:14:28] all right
[2:14:29] now in the unveiling of god brother
[2:14:31] branham said jehovah the old testament
[2:14:33] is the jesus of the new testament he's
[2:14:36] the same god just changing form
[2:14:40] and i said a baptist minister out in
[2:14:42] tucson said how can you say that jesus
[2:14:44] and god would be the same person he said
[2:14:46] well it's easy if you let your own
[2:14:49] thinking get away and think bible terms
[2:14:52] of it
[2:14:53] they are the self-same being god is a
[2:14:55] spirit jesus is the body he was dwelled
[2:14:58] in
[2:14:59] or he was veiled in
[2:15:01] so he goes on and explains that whole
[2:15:03] thing you know you know he said many
[2:15:05] want to say oh he was a jew he said he
[2:15:07] wasn't a jew he wasn't a gentile he was
[2:15:11] neither jew or gentile he was a created
[2:15:14] being by the hand of almighty god god
[2:15:17] created the
[2:15:18] the tabernacle he lived in that we know
[2:15:21] is the son of god
[2:15:23] that's right the deity supreme deed of
[2:15:25] jesus christ because god dwelt in him
[2:15:29] amen
[2:15:30] so you see all of these truths once we
[2:15:32] know that truth the gates of hell
[2:15:37] are against that restored truth
[2:15:41] but it shall not prevail against it
[2:15:44] now we've had creatures or men with
[2:15:46] their own thinking they put in it
[2:15:49] and they want to reduce jesus
[2:15:51] what in the world is wrong
[2:15:54] that anybody would want to reduce jesus
[2:15:58] christ to just a mere man
[2:16:05] that would want to deny
[2:16:07] his deity what kind of a spirit is that
[2:16:11] that has to be a devil
[2:16:14] that cannot be god
[2:16:16] god
[2:16:17] made the saint jesus both lord and
[2:16:20] christ
[2:16:23] are you with me
[2:16:24] amen so here we come right down to it
[2:16:26] the truth of godhead
[2:16:28] is that there's one supreme
[2:16:32] one eternal being
[2:16:34] known as the father and he manifested or
[2:16:37] made himself known in flesh
[2:16:41] why do why is he called the son because
[2:16:43] the eternal spirit
[2:16:45] father the body
[2:16:49] by creation
[2:16:51] father the body
[2:16:54] which we called the son
[2:16:57] because he came from the father and then
[2:17:00] the father came and dwelt in him
[2:17:02] what's so hard to understand about that
[2:17:05] it's exactly what happened in the days
[2:17:07] of abraham
[2:17:09] god made himself a body
[2:17:12] and came and dwelt in it
[2:17:14] walked right down to abraham
[2:17:17] and he called him lord
[2:17:19] come on church amen that's what he did
[2:17:22] then that's what he did in jesus christ
[2:17:24] the only difference was he started the
[2:17:27] life in mary's womb and then all the
[2:17:30] minerals and vitamins and everything
[2:17:31] else and the calcium in the pot
[2:17:33] gathered around the seed that god had
[2:17:35] put in there from the from the eating of
[2:17:38] mary and she took this food and that and
[2:17:40] made a body but then god came and dwelt
[2:17:43] in that body
[2:17:45] amen so god fathered a body that's what
[2:17:48] he did
[2:17:50] there in the days of abraham he was the
[2:17:52] author of that body
[2:17:55] and he comes and walks among men now he
[2:17:58] does the same he only did that for less
[2:18:01] than less than 12 hours
[2:18:04] i don't know
[2:18:05] it was long enough for sarah for them to
[2:18:07] kill a calf and skin it and cook it
[2:18:10] and sara to make bread and you know get
[2:18:12] old granny sarah out of the tent and get
[2:18:15] her to knead and bread and all of that
[2:18:16] you know it took a little while
[2:18:20] after all she was 90.
[2:18:26] are you with me
[2:18:28] so just a small window of time in
[2:18:31] abraham's day
[2:18:33] but in
[2:18:35] the
[2:18:36] days of jesus
[2:18:39] it was 33 years
[2:18:43] that that body walked on the earth
[2:18:46] and god came and dwelt in him
[2:18:50] you look at the miracles it was done it
[2:18:53] wasn't the flesh that did that
[2:18:55] flesh can't do that flesh can't create
[2:18:59] it was the father he said it's not me
[2:19:01] that did the work it's my father
[2:19:04] that dwelleth in me
[2:19:06] he's the one
[2:19:08] living through me doing these things
[2:19:12] what's now so you see you see he
[2:19:14] manifests himself made himself known in
[2:19:17] the flesh in the son jesus christ it was
[2:19:20] the same eternal spirit
[2:19:22] that also manifested himself as the holy
[2:19:25] ghost who dwells in us if we're born
[2:19:28] again
[2:19:29] amen it was eternal spirit that revealed
[2:19:32] himself as god above us
[2:19:36] in the old testament
[2:19:38] and then he would reveal himself to his
[2:19:40] prophets
[2:19:42] amen god above us
[2:19:44] manifests himself by the word coming to
[2:19:46] his prophet through the ages and as he
[2:19:49] revealed himself as god above us and
[2:19:51] then he would come and be god with us
[2:19:56] and then he would appear again as god in
[2:20:01] us
[2:20:03] so you see god above us as he revealed
[2:20:05] himself from creation and through the
[2:20:08] old testament that god with us as he
[2:20:10] manifests himself in christ and then god
[2:20:12] in us in the form of the indwelling
[2:20:14] spirit in the believer so you see it
[2:20:17] doesn't matter it wasn't three gods it
[2:20:19] was three different manifestations
[2:20:22] it was god changing his mask
[2:20:25] it was there god in the old testament
[2:20:27] pillar of fire it was there god in the
[2:20:30] new testament jesus christ it's now the
[2:20:33] holy ghost comes in on the day of
[2:20:35] pentecost and a pillar of fire he had
[2:20:37] returned back he said i come from god i
[2:20:40] go back to being god again
[2:20:43] amen and so he comes back to the earth
[2:20:45] as god in the form of the holy spirit
[2:20:48] not another god not another person to
[2:20:51] save god all the time changing his mask
[2:20:56] now so ever in each dispensation
[2:20:59] god has revealed himself his father god
[2:21:02] above us son god with us holy spirit god
[2:21:06] in us these are not three persons of god
[2:21:09] but these are rather three
[2:21:11] manifestations
[2:21:12] of the same great eternal being
[2:21:16] now god is a god of unfolding revelation
[2:21:20] he starts with abraham
[2:21:23] you know with the divine call he carries
[2:21:25] him on
[2:21:26] you know and and he will begin even in
[2:21:29] the book of revelation it says
[2:21:32] you know in our the book of genesis
[2:21:34] genesis 1 the bible begins with god in
[2:21:36] the beginning god
[2:21:39] created the heavens and the earth
[2:21:42] genesis 2 4 it says these are the
[2:21:45] generations
[2:21:46] of the heavens and the earth when they
[2:21:48] were created in the day that the lord
[2:21:50] god this is jehovah elohim
[2:21:53] made the earth and the heavens so now he
[2:21:56] he is jehovah elohim
[2:21:59] did you notice here
[2:22:01] again
[2:22:02] jehovah elohim lord god
[2:22:06] jehovah elohim
[2:22:09] lord jehovah god elohim
[2:22:12] so now he unfolding himself in
[2:22:15] revelation
[2:22:16] you see
[2:22:18] the primary name of lord jehovah is a
[2:22:21] self-existing one
[2:22:23] you know literally he that is who he is
[2:22:26] therefore the eternal i am
[2:22:30] but have a which which from jehovah or
[2:22:33] why yahweh is formed signifies to become
[2:22:36] or become known thus pointing to a
[2:22:38] continuant to continuous and increasing
[2:22:42] self-revelation so the name jehovah
[2:22:45] would mean the self-existing one who
[2:22:48] reveals himself
[2:22:50] so he's a god that is constantly
[2:22:53] unfolding himself
[2:22:55] and you've got to see him as he's
[2:22:58] appearing
[2:22:59] so he's been appearing and and unfold
[2:23:02] himself in revelation down to the ages
[2:23:04] now in
[2:23:05] genesis 12 1
[2:23:07] he is known to abram
[2:23:10] the lord had said genesis 12 1 the lord
[2:23:14] had said this is where he he appears to
[2:23:16] abram as lord of jehovah and he says get
[2:23:19] out of your country get to the land that
[2:23:21] i will give you
[2:23:23] so then in verse 8 he removed from there
[2:23:26] and he builds an altar unto the lord
[2:23:29] did you notice that's capital l o r d
[2:23:32] that is jehovah and he called upon the
[2:23:35] name of the lord
[2:23:38] and and so it's the name of jehovah he
[2:23:41] called upon here's the one he's
[2:23:43] worshipping
[2:23:44] now in genesis 14 8 18 genesis 14 18
[2:23:49] there is one named melchizedek
[2:23:53] now paul speaks of melchizedek as one
[2:23:57] without beginning the days or ending of
[2:23:59] life he is a high priest unto god
[2:24:01] continually he was the eternal one
[2:24:05] so now it's again another mask
[2:24:09] it's not another god or another deity is
[2:24:12] another god and and there he is the
[2:24:15] priest of the most high god in other
[2:24:17] words he is the intercessor or the
[2:24:19] mediator between god and man
[2:24:22] so here is the mystery of god i want you
[2:24:24] to guess this the flesh man jesus christ
[2:24:28] was not melchizedek
[2:24:32] but melchizedek became jesus christ
[2:24:40] are you with me this is what happened
[2:24:43] melchizedek became jesus jesus was not
[2:24:46] melchizedek
[2:24:48] jesus is the body created the mask that
[2:24:51] god created to dwell in called the sun
[2:24:55] but here melchizedek now comes to dwell
[2:24:59] in
[2:25:00] jesus christ
[2:25:02] for he is the fullness of all
[2:25:05] the expressions of god in the old
[2:25:07] testament no matter what it is whether
[2:25:10] it's jehovah or elohim or melchizedek or
[2:25:13] adonai or whether it's el shaddai
[2:25:19] it's all in jesus
[2:25:22] hallelujah now so later god would uh
[2:25:26] reveal himself after melchizedek he
[2:25:28] would reveal himself we've been over
[2:25:30] this in genesis 17 1 as else said i
[2:25:33] this was not another person
[2:25:36] nor another god but it was now another
[2:25:39] unfolding of his revelation
[2:25:43] again this is what he would do almighty
[2:25:46] in the in the he said i am the almighty
[2:25:49] god and and that is translated from the
[2:25:52] word i which means almighty most
[2:25:56] powerful
[2:25:57] this is what he said jesus said he takes
[2:26:00] his title to himself in the book of
[2:26:02] revelation 1 8 i am the almighty
[2:26:07] i am el shall i
[2:26:09] i am the god of the old testament i'm he
[2:26:12] which was which is and shall come i will
[2:26:16] always be
[2:26:20] i'm the eternal one
[2:26:23] now no matter what form or name that god
[2:26:27] revealed himself to abraham abraham knew
[2:26:30] there was but one god
[2:26:34] in all these various manifestations
[2:26:36] whether it was jehovah melchizedek or in
[2:26:39] this case of of genesis 17 el shaddai
[2:26:42] there was never three different gods or
[2:26:45] multiple deities in abraham's mind
[2:26:48] no he knew he knew it was the same god
[2:26:51] just revealed himself in a different
[2:26:53] manner
[2:26:55] now down to the scriptures god has
[2:26:57] progressively more and more revealed his
[2:27:00] care to mankind and it was often done by
[2:27:04] given a new name notice these are not
[2:27:06] all the same names lord jehovah
[2:27:10] right el
[2:27:13] elohim
[2:27:17] else said i
[2:27:19] almighty god
[2:27:22] and so all of these different names but
[2:27:25] when he would
[2:27:26] give a new name
[2:27:28] in that name was a revelation of what he
[2:27:33] was doing in that present moment
[2:27:38] for example when abraham offered the
[2:27:40] realm and a ram appeared and god uh
[2:27:43] provided around he called himself
[2:27:47] jehovah jirei
[2:27:50] it was not another god it was a new name
[2:27:52] of god jehovah jireh it was just a
[2:27:55] further revelation of the same god
[2:27:58] god was expressing himself by a new name
[2:28:01] i am the provider the i will provide
[2:28:04] myself a sacrifice
[2:28:07] say provided a lamb
[2:28:09] right
[2:28:10] and there you see god was expressing
[2:28:13] himself by a new name there was more
[2:28:16] depths
[2:28:17] of that name that he was expressing
[2:28:20] jehovah rapha means god a healer
[2:28:24] and so when people want to know more
[2:28:25] about god they would seek to know his
[2:28:27] name
[2:28:28] that's why moses said
[2:28:31] who is it that i'm going to tell the
[2:28:33] people that has sent me and he says i am
[2:28:37] who i am
[2:28:39] i am that i am
[2:28:42] in other words i am he that was which is
[2:28:45] and shall come
[2:28:47] i am the i am
[2:28:50] i am the present god for this situation
[2:28:53] i am jehovah
[2:28:57] amen i am the self-existent one and the
[2:29:01] self-existent one i am going to do this
[2:29:05] nobody has to help me do it
[2:29:07] i existed before everything
[2:29:10] i made everything
[2:29:12] i'll even make a pharaoh who was made by
[2:29:15] me to obey me because i made it i am the
[2:29:20] altar i am the creator
[2:29:22] i am the beginner and i'm the ending
[2:29:25] i am all of it
[2:29:27] i am who i am
[2:29:30] hallelujah if you get that revelation
[2:29:32] this morning he's the end of your cancer
[2:29:34] he's the end of sin he's the end of your
[2:29:37] problems come on amen he is the
[2:29:40] beginning he is beginning and you were
[2:29:43] in him in the beginning and when this
[2:29:45] world is no more you will still be here
[2:29:49] because you were part of the beginning
[2:29:51] therefore there is no end
[2:29:57] all down to the ages when people want to
[2:29:58] know more about god they sought to know
[2:30:00] his name
[2:30:01] who do we honor
[2:30:03] who do we give credit
[2:30:05] we want to know his name
[2:30:07] that's what jacob asked tell me i pray
[2:30:09] thee thy name
[2:30:10] you know he said why do you ask my name
[2:30:13] but because of asking his name he
[2:30:15] blessed him
[2:30:16] there's a blessing in and
[2:30:18] wanting to know him
[2:30:20] judges manoa said to the angel lord said
[2:30:24] what is thy name
[2:30:26] when that saiyans come to pass there
[2:30:28] again it was there um there again that
[2:30:32] that where when solomon built the temple
[2:30:34] he said i build this temple that they
[2:30:37] may fear thee as thy people israel do
[2:30:40] and that they may know that this is thy
[2:30:42] house and which i'm building and is
[2:30:44] called by thy name
[2:30:48] so his people will always be called
[2:30:51] by his name
[2:30:54] you see
[2:30:55] like the interpreter dictionary the
[2:30:57] bible says to know the name of god is to
[2:31:00] know god as he revealed himself
[2:31:03] let me repeat that to know the name of
[2:31:05] god
[2:31:06] is to know god as he revealed himself so
[2:31:10] when re use of god the name in the old
[2:31:12] testament has revelatory content in
[2:31:16] other words god is revealing himself
[2:31:18] through that name so jehovah rapha means
[2:31:20] god the healer i am the healer
[2:31:22] amen jehovah jairo i'm the provider
[2:31:25] amen all of these things elohim i'm the
[2:31:28] self-existing one there's a revelation
[2:31:31] in the name
[2:31:32] jehovah coming over the earth and
[2:31:34] dwelling in the man christ jesus took
[2:31:37] upon himself a new unfolding of the name
[2:31:41] jehovah
[2:31:43] i want you to get this
[2:31:45] jesus was not named something different
[2:31:48] he took on his father's name
[2:31:52] the one who made the body he named him
[2:31:55] after himself
[2:31:59] hallelujah amen what's this now
[2:32:03] matthew 1 21 and she shall bring forth
[2:32:05] his son and thou shalt call his name
[2:32:08] jesus
[2:32:13] for he shall save his people from their
[2:32:16] sin
[2:32:17] so there's a revelation in this name
[2:32:20] jesus
[2:32:21] about salvation
[2:32:27] and this name jesus is literally
[2:32:32] means jehovah
[2:32:34] savior
[2:32:36] so jehovah's coming again
[2:32:39] and appearing again
[2:32:41] but he's appearing
[2:32:43] in a revelation of his name
[2:32:46] in a way that has never been known
[2:32:48] before as redeemer
[2:32:50] savior so he says and he shall call his
[2:32:53] name jesus for he shall save his people
[2:32:57] from their sin so it's unfolding
[2:33:01] revelation
[2:33:02] now why does
[2:33:04] why does jehovah come in jesus christ to
[2:33:07] save us from our sins
[2:33:13] why will they call him jehovah's savior
[2:33:15] every time you say jesus you're saying
[2:33:18] jehovah's savior
[2:33:21] for he shall save his people from their
[2:33:24] sins in that name is a revelation of
[2:33:27] what he's doing
[2:33:30] are you with me his name shall be called
[2:33:33] now watch they will call his name or
[2:33:36] here's a title or a definition his name
[2:33:38] emmanuel
[2:33:41] in the words the meaning of his name
[2:33:43] emmanuel will mean god is with us
[2:33:47] not a second person come on somebody
[2:33:50] amen but the person
[2:33:52] amen behold a virgin shall be for child
[2:33:54] to bring forth a son they shall call his
[2:33:56] name emmanuel which is interpreted god
[2:34:00] with us
[2:34:01] so this jehovah's savior
[2:34:04] would be god
[2:34:07] with us
[2:34:09] he was god above us
[2:34:12] but now he's taken home flesh
[2:34:15] the word has become flesh created a body
[2:34:18] and now god is with us for what purpose
[2:34:23] salvation
[2:34:27] now
[2:34:28] she took on a name to characterize his
[2:34:31] redemptive work
[2:34:32] yeah he was spoken of as redeemer in the
[2:34:35] old testament
[2:34:36] but mankind had not known him fully as
[2:34:38] redeemer
[2:34:40] as
[2:34:41] man had not yet fully been redeemed
[2:34:43] until jesus came
[2:34:45] there was no full redemption in the old
[2:34:46] testament
[2:34:48] israel had only been redeemed out of
[2:34:50] bondage
[2:34:51] but still need to be redeemed from sin
[2:34:53] so yeah he was a redeemer in that he
[2:34:55] took them from bondage but man was still
[2:34:58] in sin
[2:34:59] you see there was a greater slavery or
[2:35:01] bondage in the slavery down in egypt
[2:35:04] so
[2:35:05] they they need a redeeming from the
[2:35:06] slavery of sin
[2:35:09] come on now
[2:35:11] amen we were all slaves
[2:35:13] not just a few of us all of us we were
[2:35:16] born slaves we were sold as slaves from
[2:35:20] our father adam
[2:35:22] and we needed a redeemer
[2:35:25] and that's why jesus came to set us free
[2:35:28] from sin
[2:35:30] are you with me so in the name that
[2:35:34] his name would be jehovah's savior
[2:35:38] jesus
[2:35:39] to save his people from their sin in him
[2:35:45] would be redemption salvation would only
[2:35:48] be in his name no other name
[2:35:53] that is given among men whereby we must
[2:35:56] be saved
[2:35:58] no other name given are you with me but
[2:36:01] the name of jesus
[2:36:04] now this was very important in that
[2:36:06] day very it's important in this day
[2:36:10] but it was important to those jewish
[2:36:12] believers
[2:36:13] because they had to seek god with his
[2:36:16] mask
[2:36:17] they had to look behind the human flesh
[2:36:20] and say that's the lord
[2:36:23] abraham had to do that he saw he sees a
[2:36:27] man walking up two angels with him and
[2:36:30] he looks there and he said my lord
[2:36:33] it's jehovah he had to recognize him in
[2:36:36] his mask
[2:36:39] and then see it's like a drama and one
[2:36:42] character can play different
[2:36:44] different scenes he just goes and
[2:36:46] changes his clothes into the mask and he
[2:36:48] comes back out he's one
[2:36:50] on the stage and he's this and another
[2:36:52] he's he's another character well that's
[2:36:54] what god did
[2:36:56] this is a great drama
[2:36:58] and so god would come on the scene and
[2:37:01] he would reveal himself as elohim in the
[2:37:04] beginning elohim created the heavens and
[2:37:07] the earth curtains close comes back over
[2:37:10] and then the lord god
[2:37:13] made the seas
[2:37:15] and the curtains open
[2:37:17] there in the lord god lord jehovah
[2:37:20] elohim
[2:37:22] then he comes and reveals himself el
[2:37:24] shaddai
[2:37:26] milk kills the deck
[2:37:29] it's the same god all the time
[2:37:32] and he's just changing his mouth and now
[2:37:35] you see because of his mass they
[2:37:38] crucified him
[2:37:42] they did not recognize the lord of glory
[2:37:47] amen you see now they knew him as
[2:37:49] jehovah of the old testament of the old
[2:37:52] testament but they had to know him as
[2:37:55] the jesus of the new testament
[2:37:58] it was no longer enough to know him as
[2:38:01] jehovah who led them out of egypt now
[2:38:04] they must know him as jehovah savior
[2:38:11] because jehovah had now come to save
[2:38:13] them and they had to know god in the
[2:38:15] revelation of his name as he was
[2:38:18] revealed in christ
[2:38:20] when paul saw him
[2:38:23] he
[2:38:24] you know he was instructed
[2:38:26] he says arise and be baptized washing
[2:38:29] away thy sins calling on the name of the
[2:38:31] lord what was the name of the lord what
[2:38:33] was the name he was going to call on
[2:38:36] you see he was told for his sins to be
[2:38:38] washed away arise and be baptized
[2:38:42] calling on the name of the lord
[2:38:45] invoking the name of the lord you see
[2:38:47] this this is an important part of
[2:38:50] salvation there is no salvation in
[2:38:53] titles of father son and holy ghost
[2:38:56] salvation only is in the name
[2:39:02] although he is father
[2:39:04] son holy ghost he's also wonderful
[2:39:07] counselor prince of peace none of them
[2:39:09] will work
[2:39:10] for salvation but the name of jesus
[2:39:18] just a few days earlier paul had asked
[2:39:20] that question who art thou lord he said
[2:39:22] i'm jesus
[2:39:24] i'm the one you're persecuting
[2:39:26] so he revealed himself
[2:39:29] he revealed himself jesus revealed
[2:39:31] himself to paul is lord paul knew about
[2:39:33] the lord god of the old testament but at
[2:39:35] that time he did not serve the jesus of
[2:39:37] the new testament you see here he was
[2:39:40] going about trying to do service for
[2:39:41] jehovah
[2:39:43] and jehovah was now here in a different
[2:39:45] form and he was trying to destroy him
[2:39:49] why persecuted thou me
[2:39:54] and so when he learned
[2:39:57] he learned that the lord of the old
[2:39:59] testament was the same as the lord of
[2:40:01] the new testament
[2:40:03] and to his
[2:40:04] amazement the lord's name was jesus
[2:40:09] it was the same god the same person it
[2:40:12] was an expression of his name and a
[2:40:14] redemptive
[2:40:15] word
[2:40:17] and there's no salvation in any other
[2:40:20] name
[2:40:21] or
[2:40:23] any other god or any other person than
[2:40:26] jesus christ remember why did he do this
[2:40:29] he had to take on a
[2:40:32] mask he had to come and step down among
[2:40:36] man
[2:40:37] he had to allow now that flesh body to
[2:40:40] die
[2:40:42] for redemption's sake
[2:40:44] to become the lamb
[2:40:47] to become the redeemer
[2:40:49] are you with me amen but now so here we
[2:40:52] come jesus is the highest name of god
[2:40:56] ever revealed to mankind
[2:41:00] hallelujah you'll never get the first
[2:41:03] base if you don't believe in the supreme
[2:41:06] deity of our lord jesus christ
[2:41:08] it is a supreme revelation of god today
[2:41:12] no other name
[2:41:13] i want to say it real clear no other
[2:41:16] name of god has ever been so full of
[2:41:19] god's glory
[2:41:20] that's revealing his nature
[2:41:23] his character to humanity as much as the
[2:41:26] name of jesus
[2:41:28] no matter whether he expressed himself
[2:41:30] as el shaddai or melchizedek or elohim
[2:41:33] or jehovah the old testament
[2:41:35] jesus literally means jehovah's
[2:41:38] salvation and it's the fullness of the
[2:41:42] revelation of god as redeemer
[2:41:45] it lies all lies within that name when
[2:41:50] you say jesus you are saying my healer
[2:41:54] when you say jesus you are saying my
[2:41:57] provider when you say jesus come on when
[2:42:01] you call on that name you are saying
[2:42:03] savior whatever need humanity has all
[2:42:07] lays in the name jesus
[2:42:11] it is the highest name of all name that
[2:42:14] at the mention of that name every demon
[2:42:17] has to bow every spirit has to fall
[2:42:24] hallelujah in that name encapsulates and
[2:42:28] encounter encompasses all the former
[2:42:31] revelations of god jesus amen in jesus
[2:42:35] is melchizedek
[2:42:37] amen he is el shaddai he is jehovah
[2:42:41] jireh he is jehovah nishi he is jehovah
[2:42:45] rapha my healer
[2:42:47] amen everything is encapsulated in that
[2:42:50] name there's not a greater revelation of
[2:42:53] god than in jesus
[2:42:55] and from him
[2:42:57] is the source of all
[2:43:00] other revelations
[2:43:02] amen
[2:43:04] so if jesus
[2:43:05] if the name jesus
[2:43:07] is god incarnate
[2:43:10] then jesus is the greatest name ever
[2:43:13] been revealed
[2:43:15] think of that
[2:43:16] amen his name shall be called jesus
[2:43:20] for he will save his people from the sin
[2:43:22] jehovah will save his people
[2:43:25] this is the greatest thing
[2:43:29] you see even in the former names of
[2:43:32] jehovah jehovah rapha jovanishin jehovah
[2:43:35] driver el shaddai melchizedek
[2:43:37] never in there was salvation
[2:43:41] none of that melchizedek didn't save
[2:43:43] abraham from sin
[2:43:47] jehovah jireh
[2:43:48] did not save
[2:43:50] him from sin
[2:43:53] all the other names over initial said i
[2:43:56] didn't save him from sin
[2:43:58] come on somebody
[2:44:00] salvation from sin is only in that one
[2:44:04] name
[2:44:05] jesus
[2:44:06] and without that name you cannot be
[2:44:10] saved
[2:44:12] it might become a common name to you but
[2:44:14] the name of jesus is the greatest name
[2:44:16] above all names there is no other name
[2:44:18] like jesus
[2:44:20] there is no higher name than jesus
[2:44:26] you see he's a great this is a direct
[2:44:29] fulfillment of this prophecy isaiah 17
[2:44:32] 7 14 therefore the lord himself shall
[2:44:36] give you a sign behold the virgin shall
[2:44:38] conceive beareth son call his name
[2:44:40] emmanuel this emanuel means god with us
[2:44:43] as matthew 1 23 said so literally god
[2:44:47] was humanity since god himself
[2:44:50] was incarnate in jesus christ
[2:44:53] jehovah
[2:44:54] savior
[2:44:56] there you have in those two parts
[2:44:58] jehovah's savior the fulfillment of a
[2:45:01] manual
[2:45:02] which includes two part meaning god with
[2:45:05] us
[2:45:06] see god
[2:45:08] with us
[2:45:10] two parts and that fulfillment is in
[2:45:13] jehovah
[2:45:14] savior
[2:45:16] god coming down to take on human battles
[2:45:19] god coming down to deliver you from
[2:45:21] slave owners
[2:45:23] that devil that had rule over your life
[2:45:25] from the first birth
[2:45:26] he's now coming his savior to save you
[2:45:28] from sin
[2:45:30] it's simply
[2:45:31] it's simply another
[2:45:33] another a
[2:45:34] manner of extending the revelation of
[2:45:36] himself as he did in the old testament
[2:45:39] call himself jehovah provider jehovah
[2:45:41] healer
[2:45:43] melchizedek el said i all of these other
[2:45:46] names
[2:45:47] all these characteristics was in jesus
[2:45:51] and all the new testament saints
[2:45:54] saw something that abraham
[2:45:56] didn't even get to see all
[2:45:58] right
[2:45:59] and that being deliverance
[2:46:01] they've seen the characteristics of god
[2:46:04] that was never fully revealed to the old
[2:46:06] testament
[2:46:08] think about it in the omega church it's
[2:46:10] a greater revelation
[2:46:13] because they didn't know him as savior
[2:46:15] they still had to live in their sins but
[2:46:17] you can't be set free from your sins
[2:46:21] sin nature dies and you're born again
[2:46:24] and since salvation is the greatest
[2:46:26] revelation ever given to man then the
[2:46:30] name jesus is the highest name ever
[2:46:32] given because it is jehovah coming to
[2:46:34] save and without him there is no
[2:46:37] salvation and cannot be salvation
[2:46:40] this is why paul would say in
[2:46:41] philippians 2 and 9 wherefore
[2:46:44] god hath highly exalted him and gave him
[2:46:47] a name which is above every name
[2:46:52] hallelujah so if you're questioning
[2:46:55] whether it's the highest name or not you
[2:46:56] ought to be able to look right there and
[2:46:58] see it he gave him a name which is above
[2:47:01] every name
[2:47:02] this name is greater than melchizedek no
[2:47:05] salvation in that name greater than else
[2:47:08] said i no salvation in that name
[2:47:11] amen this name is greater come on
[2:47:14] there's healing in this name deliverance
[2:47:16] in this name salvation in this name a
[2:47:18] rapture in his name every promise in
[2:47:20] that name
[2:47:23] hallelujah that's why god wanted you his
[2:47:26] bride to know him by name
[2:47:28] because you are the people to become a
[2:47:31] covenant with him and take on his name
[2:47:35] a people of the book of people of his
[2:47:38] name
[2:47:44] you know if jesus is not god's name then
[2:47:46] we have a person who possesses a greater
[2:47:48] name than god's own name
[2:47:51] so the conclusion must be that
[2:47:53] jesus
[2:47:55] must be god's name
[2:47:59] oh my
[2:48:01] look the bible said in philippians 2 10
[2:48:04] that at the name of jesus
[2:48:07] every knee should bow
[2:48:09] of things in heaven things on earth
[2:48:11] things under the earth
[2:48:14] every knee would bow
[2:48:16] every other thing has to bow
[2:48:19] to that boy great name
[2:48:21] there's no salvation in the other name
[2:48:24] there's no salvation when you invoke
[2:48:26] melchizedek
[2:48:28] no salvation when you invoke
[2:48:33] jehovah jireh
[2:48:36] there's only
[2:48:37] in the revelation of the name jesus
[2:48:40] is their salvation
[2:48:42] now i'm going to try to bring this down
[2:48:44] to close
[2:48:46] because i want to say something
[2:48:49] you see
[2:48:50] in acts 4 and 10
[2:48:53] peter said be it known unto you all and
[2:48:56] to all the people of israel
[2:48:57] that by the name of jesus of nazareth
[2:48:59] whom you crucified
[2:49:02] whom god raised from the dead even by
[2:49:04] him that this man stand hold but before
[2:49:06] you hold
[2:49:07] this is a stone
[2:49:09] that was said at night of you builders
[2:49:11] which has become the head of the corner
[2:49:14] neither is there salvation in any other
[2:49:18] for there is none other name among under
[2:49:22] heaven given among men whereby we must
[2:49:27] be
[2:49:28] saved
[2:49:31] so peter is saying to those jews you've
[2:49:33] known him as melchizedek elohim jehovah
[2:49:37] all of these great names
[2:49:39] but you know what you can come now and
[2:49:41] you can scream and cry and use those
[2:49:43] names and get nothing
[2:49:47] you cannot be saved in any other name
[2:49:49] you want to be delivered you got to come
[2:49:51] to this
[2:49:53] you've name
[2:49:53] to realize who this is
[2:49:55] you've got to see god behind this mask
[2:49:59] you've got to know who it is
[2:50:01] and peter's saying you can pray scream
[2:50:03] cry get nothing you will not find
[2:50:05] deliverance in the other name unless you
[2:50:07] know god by this name jesus
[2:50:12] this expression of his revelation
[2:50:14] jehovah's savior
[2:50:16] you cannot be saved
[2:50:20] think of
[2:50:20] that
[2:50:22] about 99 of christians don't have that
[2:50:24] revelation
[2:50:26] too many message believers don't have
[2:50:28] that revelation
[2:50:30] but god has made it known to you that he
[2:50:33] is this same jesus he has made both lord
[2:50:37] and christ let's go to acts chapter 2
[2:50:39] and verse 36
[2:50:41] i'm going to try to finish with this
[2:50:43] last scripture
[2:50:46] at his birth he was given the name jesus
[2:50:51] but after he died and bear and rose
[2:50:53] again this is what peter said of him
[2:50:56] therefore let all of the house of israel
[2:50:59] know assuredly
[2:51:01] that god hath made this same jesus
[2:51:04] whom you have crucified both lord
[2:51:08] and christ
[2:51:11] now watch
[2:51:13] this jesus who was crucified after his
[2:51:16] death barrel and resurrection
[2:51:19] is now
[2:51:20] both lord
[2:51:22] and christ
[2:51:25] he is no longer just a
[2:51:27] mere man
[2:51:28] he is the supreme lord
[2:51:34] almighty god
[2:51:35] because when he was raised up from the
[2:51:37] dead and ascended on high
[2:51:40] and his body glorified are you with me
[2:51:44] he becomes both lord
[2:51:47] and
[2:51:48] christ
[2:51:50] so the very body of jesus
[2:51:54] was glorified
[2:51:57] can i say it
[2:51:58] deified
[2:52:01] and i want you to understand in
[2:52:04] the
[2:52:05] ages to come
[2:52:07] he will still be
[2:52:09] lord
[2:52:12] when all redemption is complete
[2:52:15] and he surrenders the kingdom back to
[2:52:17] his father
[2:52:18] showing that his work of kinsmen
[2:52:20] redeemer is now over when the last
[2:52:23] person has been saved and the earth has
[2:52:25] been fully restored and redeemed and
[2:52:27] it's all over and his whole purpose of
[2:52:29] kinsman's work is finished
[2:52:34] he will be god
[2:52:38] the very god
[2:52:40] and that body that was flesh but now
[2:52:43] glorified will always be the only
[2:52:47] visible manifestation of god because
[2:52:50] that's his body
[2:52:52] it will not be done away
[2:52:55] it will not be discarded it will not be
[2:52:58] set aside
[2:53:04] just as your glory by body will always
[2:53:07] be the visible manifestation of your
[2:53:10] eternal spirit
[2:53:11] so will the body of jesus always be the
[2:53:15] visible manifestation of the eternal god
[2:53:21] just as your body
[2:53:23] makes your human spirit visible now
[2:53:27] and will make it visible in heaven when
[2:53:29] it's glorified
[2:53:31] even so jesus made the eternal and holy
[2:53:35] spirit visible john 1 18 said no man has
[2:53:37] seen god at any time the only begotten
[2:53:39] of the father which were the only
[2:53:41] begotten son which is in the bosom of
[2:53:43] the father he had declared him
[2:53:45] nobody could see god
[2:53:48] but he had to have a mask
[2:53:50] for abraham to see him he had to have a
[2:53:53] mask
[2:53:54] for him to be seen two thousand years
[2:53:56] ago and walk to the shores of galilee he
[2:53:58] needed a mask
[2:54:00] in the great eternals ahead
[2:54:03] for him to be seen
[2:54:05] he will have a body
[2:54:08] let me just say there's no eternal son
[2:54:11] and one day sonship will be finished
[2:54:15] his purpose of being the son will come
[2:54:18] to the end
[2:54:19] jesus work as savior will be over with
[2:54:22] and the sonship will cease
[2:54:25] but the body of jesus will never return
[2:54:28] to cosmic light and potentially clay his
[2:54:31] body like yours will never be
[2:54:34] annihilated and he will never ever just
[2:54:38] become one of of of the brothers he will
[2:54:41] always be through eternity the body
[2:54:44] where the fullness of god dwells
[2:54:48] and that day when it's all over
[2:54:51] and the kingdom is surrendered and
[2:54:53] handed back to the father
[2:54:55] we will still bow and reverence jesus
[2:54:58] christ
[2:54:59] as god
[2:55:00] almighty
[2:55:06] never annihilated
[2:55:10] that mask that he took on two thousand
[2:55:12] years ago
[2:55:14] that sets now
[2:55:15] as a man to be our approach to god the
[2:55:18] invisible god the only way we can
[2:55:19] approach is through jesus
[2:55:22] so we come to the throne with our
[2:55:24] prayers to the man christ jesus who
[2:55:27] understands us as a man
[2:55:30] but that very man is the almighty god
[2:55:34] and that very man through the eternities
[2:55:40] will be
[2:55:41] the visible manifestation
[2:55:44] of almighty god
[2:55:46] and one day
[2:55:48] you will have your opportunity
[2:55:50] to stroll hand in hand
[2:55:54] with the almighty
[2:55:56] god sit an audience with him as his
[2:55:59] queen
[2:56:00] rule and reign with him through the
[2:56:02] millennial reign
[2:56:05] you know why
[2:56:07] because you're jesus too
[2:56:10] he's jesus
[2:56:12] you're miss jesus
[2:56:15] and that's where he's manifested
[2:56:18] in this day
[2:56:19] it says miss jesus
[2:56:22] but one day
[2:56:23] mr jesus will come
[2:56:25] and miss jesus will go and meet him in
[2:56:27] the air
[2:56:29] and they'll have a
[2:56:30] marriage supper together
[2:56:33] for three and a half years
[2:56:35] and after that a honeymoon of a thousand
[2:56:37] years
[2:56:39] and we'll rule and reign with christ
[2:56:42] hallelujah amen the lion will lay down
[2:56:45] with the lamb
[2:56:47] there'll be nothing to hurt or destroy
[2:56:48] in all my holy mountain
[2:56:51] and then
[2:56:52] at the end there be satan loose for a
[2:56:55] short season
[2:56:57] and then will come the final battle
[2:56:59] while the saints camp on the breath of
[2:57:01] the earth
[2:57:03] and then the battle
[2:57:04] is finished and satan his angels and all
[2:57:07] the evil ones cast into hell and will be
[2:57:10] no more
[2:57:12] amen
