[40:54] pray in Jesus name
[40:57] amen amen let's turn the Hebrews chapter
[41:01] 4.
[41:03] amen
[41:09] also you could
[41:11] turn to Revelations 1 and verse 16 as
[41:14] well
[41:18] amen it says for the word of God is
[41:21] quick
[41:22] and powerful and sharper than any
[41:25] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[41:28] dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit of
[41:31] the joints in Morrow and is a discerner
[41:34] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[41:37] I just want to look on that word today
[41:39] uh this evening on quick
[41:41] it means alive
[41:43] I mean the word of God is quick also
[41:46] Revelations 1 and verse 16 says he and
[41:49] he had in his right hand Seven Stars and
[41:52] out of his mouth went sharp two-edged
[41:55] sword and his countenance was as the sun
[41:58] shining in his strength and when I saw
[42:02] him I fell at his feet as dead and he
[42:05] laid his right hand upon me say it unto
[42:07] me fear not I am the first and the last
[42:10] I am he that liveth and was dead and
[42:14] behold I'm Alive forevermore amen and
[42:18] have the keys of hell and of death
[42:21] also real quick to Romans 8 11 said but
[42:24] if the spirit of him that raised up
[42:26] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[42:29] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[42:31] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[42:34] spirit that dwelleth in you amen we'll
[42:38] let you be be seated
[42:40] I'd like to speak to you on the light
[42:43] the quickening power
[42:46] like the quickening power this quick
[42:49] because I said it means to be alive
[42:51] it means to be breathing it means to be
[42:55] among the living in other words not
[42:57] lifeless nor dead but it means to be
[43:00] active it means blessed it means to be
[43:03] endless in the kingdom of God it's also
[43:06] a living as a living water having vital
[43:09] power in itself and exerting the same
[43:12] power upon the soul it also is to be
[43:15] full of vigor to be fresh to be strong
[43:18] to be efficient to be active to be
[43:21] powerful to be efficacious that's what
[43:24] the word of God is to us tonight amen
[43:27] and you know every one of us we find
[43:29] ourselves in life as we were as seeds
[43:32] planted in the ground we were dead and
[43:35] we had to go through a Time of Dying
[43:37] Amen to be birthing but it would take a
[43:40] light that would shine upon our lives
[43:42] that would begin to create a certain a
[43:44] certain atmosphere around us to where we
[43:47] would come to life and that that you
[43:49] know a seed is has no power in it unless
[43:51] unless it comes to life it can never
[43:54] bring forth a fruit it can never bring
[43:56] forth a branch or a leaf it can never
[43:58] bring forth one little blade of grass
[44:00] unless that seed dies and that seed
[44:03] comes to life and God that's God's uh
[44:05] that's God's desire he he wants the
[44:08] Earth to be fruitful and replenished he
[44:10] wants amen seeds that was what he placed
[44:13] in the Earth was to come forth and to
[44:15] come out of the ground amen not to just
[44:17] lay their dormant or not to lay there
[44:19] dead or lay their lifeless but there to
[44:22] be a life that would come upon them and
[44:24] begin to pull them out of the muck and
[44:26] the mire that they were in into the
[44:28] presence of the Sun and we can see that
[44:30] in Ephesians 2 and verse 1 it says you
[44:33] hath he quick him or Made Alive who were
[44:36] once dead in trespasses and since we're
[44:39] in times past you walked according to
[44:42] the course of this world according to
[44:44] the prince of the power of the air the
[44:46] spirit that now worketh and the children
[44:48] of Disobedience among whom also we all
[44:51] all had our conversations in times past
[44:54] and the lust of our flesh or our manner
[44:57] of living is what conversation means and
[44:59] the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[45:01] desires of the Flesh and of the mind and
[45:04] were by Nature the children of Wrath as
[45:06] others but God who is rich in Mercy for
[45:10] with his great love wherewith he loved
[45:13] us
[45:14] I'm thankful that just shows me before
[45:16] we were lovable he loved us amen before
[45:20] we were righteous he loved us before we
[45:23] were amen come to our ourselves and we
[45:26] and we realized who we really was he
[45:29] loved us because of his mercy and his
[45:31] grace even when we were dead in sins he
[45:34] has quickened us together in Christ even
[45:37] when we were laying in that old mud pile
[45:40] and that old muck and that old that old
[45:42] Mary clay God rich in Mercy looked down
[45:45] over where we were laying and he placed
[45:47] a seed on the inside of there and he
[45:49] came looking for that seed he came
[45:52] looking for that life to come forth at a
[45:54] certain time he would pull Paul out in
[45:56] the Ephesian churches and he'd pull out
[45:58] others down to the Dark Ages but he came
[46:01] down to this last age and these last
[46:03] times and he's still looking for seeds
[46:06] to come to life he's still looking for
[46:08] children of God to rise up out of the
[46:10] myri clay and out of the sin and out of
[46:13] the unbelief and out of the I the Gloom
[46:15] as it were and Rise into the into the
[46:18] heavenlies amen even when we were dead
[46:20] in sins and his quickness or made us
[46:23] alive together with Christ by Grace ye
[46:26] are saved and has raised us up together
[46:29] and made us sit together in Heavenly
[46:32] places in Christ Jesus he would also say
[46:35] in Colossians 2 and verse 13 He said you
[46:38] being dead in your sins and the
[46:40] uncircumcision of your flesh has he
[46:43] quickened together with him having
[46:45] forgiven you all trespasses
[46:49] Hallelujah I haven't forgiven you all
[46:51] trespasses blotting out the handwriting
[46:55] of ordinance that was against us which
[46:57] was contrary to us and took it out of
[46:59] the way and nailed it to his cross and a
[47:02] spoiled principalities and powers and
[47:05] made a show of them openly triumphing
[47:08] over them in it amen oh my that song
[47:11] this is there's no wall he won't tear
[47:13] down there's no lie he won't tear down
[47:16] amen he's going to come after his amen
[47:19] no matter what the devil has tried to
[47:21] fence them in and to cover them up with
[47:23] sin and unbelief that light of God is
[47:26] going to search his seeds out he's going
[47:28] to search and I believe he's still
[47:30] searching tonight amen I believe God is
[47:33] still calling the lost I believe God is
[47:35] still calling the lost to be Sons and
[47:37] Daughters of God Amen I don't believe
[47:39] Mercy is over because God is rich in
[47:42] mercy God is abundant in Mercy and he's
[47:45] got enough Mercy to last all the way
[47:47] down to the very last call amen I don't
[47:50] believe we got down to 2023 and God's
[47:53] dipping weight down and saying you know
[47:55] what angels I ain't got enough Mercy for
[47:57] that one I ain't got enough Mercy for
[47:59] that one no sir if there's a seed of God
[48:01] on the inside God's still got Mercy for
[48:04] that sin because God is rich in Mercy
[48:07] how many is grateful for that I'm
[48:09] thankful that God didn't come in
[48:11] 1975. amen because there was a seed that
[48:14] had to be born in 1976. I'm glad he
[48:18] didn't come in 1980 because that seed
[48:20] still had to come to life
[48:23] come on why did he not because there
[48:25] were seeds laying there why are we still
[48:27] here because there's still Seas laying
[48:30] in the ground that has to come to life
[48:32] amen I believe God is still calling God
[48:35] is still wooing and he's showing he'll
[48:37] spoil principalities he'll spoil Powers
[48:40] he'll spoil hell to go down to where one
[48:44] of his children are he'll break down
[48:46] bars he'll break down walls he'll tear
[48:49] down unbelief he'll he'll tear down
[48:51] every kind of thing the devil will ever
[48:54] try to do to hold one of his why because
[48:56] God is still rich in Mercy and he's
[48:59] still seeking those that are lost okay

[50:35] years but God don't give up God still
[50:38] keeps searching God still keeps turning
[50:40] over this Stone calling out to that one

[51:15] strongholds that is held a man for 20

[51:22] orchestrate it a certain way to speak to
[51:25] him his heart exactly what he had cried
[51:28] out

[51:34] Hallelujah Matthew 27 and verse 66 Sue
[51:38] we can read about the resurrection
[51:41] morning we we we know it as a as one of
[51:45] our cornerstones as we would say Amen
[51:47] it's what it's actually the thing that
[51:50] holds the Bible altogether
[51:52] because if he had came and he had died
[51:54] and he had went into a grave I'd have
[51:56] been just an ordinary man but he said
[51:58] I'm going to lay my life down and I got
[52:00] power to raise it up again it proved who
[52:03] he really was and we can read here in
[52:05] verse 62 of Matthew chapter 27 it says
[52:08] the next day this is following the
[52:10] crucifixion that followed the day of the
[52:12] preparation the chief priests and
[52:14] Pharisees came together into pilate
[52:16] saying sir we remember that that
[52:18] deceiver said while he was yet alive
[52:20] after three days I'll rise again
[52:24] amen they remembered what he said but
[52:26] they couldn't do nothing about him
[52:28] Rising again hey remember what he had
[52:31] said listen the devil listens to the
[52:33] word of God he believed the devil
[52:35] listens he he believes and trembles he
[52:37] knows what the Bible said he knows that
[52:39] there's going to be a bride without spot
[52:41] without wrinkle I remember what his word
[52:44] said but there ain't nothing he can do
[52:46] about it there's going to be a bride
[52:48] without spot without wrinkle he
[52:50] remembers there's going to be a
[52:51] resurrection in this last day but there
[52:54] ain't nothing he can do about it he can
[52:56] plan all he wants to to try to stop it
[52:59] but it'll not stop it
[53:01] [Applause]
[53:04] um
[53:05] amen sir we remember that that deceiver
[53:08] said well if he was really a deceiver
[53:10] why are they worried about what he said
[53:15] command therefore that the Sepulcher be
[53:18] made sure unto the third day unless his
[53:21] disciples come by night and steal him
[53:24] away and say unto the people he has
[53:27] risen from the dead so the last Heir
[53:30] shall be worse than the first
[53:34] pilate said unto them you have a watch
[53:36] go your way make it as sure as you can
[53:43] the devil try to make as sure as he
[53:46] could to keep you from coming to life
[53:50] he tried to make it as sure as he could
[53:52] to keep you sealed in his tomb and
[53:55] sealed in your unbelief and sealed in
[53:58] your doubt he tried to do everything go
[54:00] make it as sure as you can
[54:03] but if there's a seed in there it's
[54:06] going to come out
[54:11] amen
[54:13] so they went
[54:15] and they made disciplical sure
[54:18] sealing the stone and setting a watch
[54:22] amen the devil was sure he was going to
[54:25] hold some of y'all in drugs he was sure
[54:28] he was going to hold you in pornography
[54:30] he was sure he was going to trap you one
[54:33] way or another he was sure that you was
[54:35] going to be down and defeated a long
[54:37] time ago he was sure you would have done
[54:39] gave up by now he was sure you would
[54:42] have said this message name for me I
[54:44] might as well walk away he was sure he
[54:47] would pour it on you and pour it on you
[54:48] and pour it on you and to destroy your
[54:51] finances and destroy your family and
[54:54] destroy everything he was sure by now
[54:56] you would give up
[54:59] but he doesn't realize the quickening
[55:02] power that can come to a seed
[55:04] [Applause]
[55:09] Amen in the end of the Sabbath as it
[55:13] began to Dawn toward the first day of
[55:15] the week Came Mary Magdalene and the
[55:17] other Mary to see the Sepulcher and
[55:19] behold that was a great earthquake for
[55:22] the angel of the Lord descended from
[55:24] heaven and came and rolled back the
[55:27] Stone from the door and sat upon it
[55:30] to me I love that right there because he
[55:34] took the stone that sealed him in there
[55:37] they had taken the Roman seal and they'd
[55:39] put it all around there to make sure
[55:41] there was no disciple could sneak up
[55:42] during the night and tear it apart and
[55:45] put a guard around it and everything
[55:46] else but here comes this light and it
[55:49] comes down and it blinds them and it put
[55:52] and there's such a power that comes
[55:54] forth that it breaks the seals off the
[55:56] stone and then he rolls that stone over
[55:58] they see something you think's a great
[56:01] big hindrance is nothing to God Amen he
[56:03] can try to put a great big Stone over
[56:05] your life he can try to seal you in he
[56:08] can try to keep you in he can try to Bow
[56:10] you he can try to do whatever he wants
[56:12] to but when that light begins to come
[56:15] down and begins to pull upon your life
[56:17] it'll break seals it'll pull stones out
[56:20] of the way it'll do whatever it has to
[56:23] and then it'll roll that big old problem
[56:25] over and it'll sit down on it
[56:27] [Applause]
[56:29] what you thought was impossible is
[56:32] nothing but a place for God to sit upon
[56:35] what you thought was impossible is a
[56:37] place God can show you I've got
[56:39] Authority I've got power and I got
[56:42] ability
[56:44] come on somebody we're gonna have church
[56:47] tonight amen because I know amen the
[56:50] devil's been telling you what you're
[56:51] dealing with is impossible what you're
[56:54] dealing with ain't no way there ain't no
[56:56] hell there's nothing can be done about
[56:58] it but the light is coming down and it's
[57:01] pulling a seed out and it's pulling the
[57:03] power of God out and it's breaking
[57:05] sealed and Rolling Stones away
[57:09] come on somebody
[57:15] and all of a sudden
[57:17] he rolled back the stone and sat on it
[57:20] and his countenance was like lightning
[57:26] has a bright light
[57:29] and as Raymond white as snow and for
[57:33] fear of him the keepers
[57:36] the ones that was going to make sure
[57:40] that this wasn't going to happen
[57:42] the one do you see how God did it
[57:46] he said y'all just go make sure
[57:49] but in y'all's making sure it's going to
[57:51] prove who I am
[57:55] hello somebody and you're making sure
[57:58] that the stone is going to stay there
[58:00] and that that the body is going to stay
[58:02] there it's actually going to really
[58:04] truly prove who I am
[58:09] and somebody said this well here a while
[58:11] back it was a powerful thought listen
[58:13] God didn't move the stone away for
[58:15] himself
[58:17] he could walk through walls that body of
[58:20] Jesus could have stood up and walked
[58:22] right through that stone wall right to
[58:25] the outside he didn't need the stone to
[58:27] move away for him to pull come out
[58:30] but he moved the stone for you
[58:34] he moved the stone so you would know
[58:36] amen the power of God came down and it
[58:40] broke the Seal of the Romans and if and
[58:42] it caused the keepers who were going to
[58:44] make sure
[58:45] Mercy Jesus amen those drugs that we're
[58:48] going to make sure that alcohol that was
[58:50] going to make sure that tobacco that was
[58:52] going to make sure that that adultery
[58:55] there was going to make sure whatever it
[58:57] was that the devil had positioned upon
[58:59] your life was going to make sure it
[59:01] actually and and his defeat prove that
[59:04] God has done something for you
[59:12] and the fear of him the keepers did
[59:15] Shake
[59:16] and became as dead men
[59:21] and the angel answered and said unto the
[59:23] women fear not you
[59:25] for I know that you seek Jesus which was
[59:28] crucified
[59:29] he's not here for he has risen
[59:32] did you follow the context of all of
[59:35] that
[59:35] the lightning came down white as Raymond
[59:39] wool sitting on the breaks the seal
[59:42] breaks the stone sits upon it and then
[59:45] he said he's not here
[59:49] his body was already gone
[59:53] he was showing without
[59:56] any doubt
[59:58] without any kind of thing that they
[1:00:01] could come up with listen the keepers
[1:00:03] had to say hey something's happened
[1:00:05] they had to testify amen something they
[1:00:08] saw amen they came as dead men
[1:00:14] he made them stand still so they
[1:00:17] couldn't do nothing about it they
[1:00:19] couldn't stop the Stone from Rolling
[1:00:21] away they couldn't keep the seals on
[1:00:22] there they couldn't put it back if they
[1:00:24] wanted to put they became his dead man
[1:00:27] he made them stand still and see the
[1:00:30] glory of God
[1:00:33] Hallelujah that's exactly what happened
[1:00:36] on your Resurrection Day When God came
[1:00:38] over your life and lightning came down
[1:00:40] like as as it were from heaven and it
[1:00:43] struck something on the inside of you
[1:00:45] the enemy that was holding you and he
[1:00:47] was holding and he was holding and light
[1:00:50] fell down and it broke them and they
[1:00:52] became as dead men what was it they
[1:00:55] became powerless no more could they hold
[1:00:57] you no more could they keep you no more
[1:01:00] could they put you back
[1:01:02] Hallelujah they didn't get him out and
[1:01:05] they couldn't put him back
[1:01:07] come on somebody that devil didn't get
[1:01:10] you out of where you was God brought you
[1:01:12] out and if God brought you out the devil
[1:01:15] won't put you back in he cannot do what
[1:01:18] God has already done for you
[1:01:23] quickening power
[1:01:25] the word of God
[1:01:27] was spoken many many hundreds of years
[1:01:29] before his coming
[1:01:31] of his crucifixion of his death of her
[1:01:36] suffering but it also spoke of his
[1:01:39] resurrection
[1:01:41] all the things that Jesus did and all
[1:01:44] the all of his Vindication of God's word
[1:01:46] and what he did for to fulfill it
[1:01:49] Healing The Sick raising the dead
[1:01:51] casting out Devils preaching the gospel
[1:01:54] to the poor fulfilling every word that
[1:01:57] God said that he would do when he came
[1:02:00] and then also suffering for our sins and
[1:02:02] our stead to be the perpetuation for our
[1:02:05] sin at the cross where no one else could
[1:02:07] have done it for him
[1:02:09] but above all of that
[1:02:12] I think the Resurrection on Easter
[1:02:14] morning it sealed the whole thing
[1:02:19] because they've been prophets on the
[1:02:21] earth before and they had prophesied
[1:02:23] before they had healed the sick before
[1:02:25] they had raised the dead before they had
[1:02:28] done the same signs Jesus was doing
[1:02:31] but the resurrection proved who he was
[1:02:36] it proved that the quickening power was
[1:02:39] there and it sealed the word of God
[1:02:41] forever for the believer all Gloom and
[1:02:44] all doubt was shattered on this Blissful
[1:02:47] morning more hallelujah oh think about
[1:02:49] it I want you to kind of key on that
[1:02:51] word Gloom right there because we're
[1:02:52] going to get somewhere on that man had
[1:02:55] been shut up as it was in a prison house
[1:02:57] amen but what happened God came down and
[1:03:00] he became flesh and and he moved among
[1:03:03] them and he did signs and wonders and
[1:03:05] all that's wonderful but he and he died
[1:03:07] for their sin and he said it's finished
[1:03:10] and all that's great
[1:03:12] but it wouldn't have been for that
[1:03:13] Resurrection morning
[1:03:16] it had been just as any other man
[1:03:21] his dying would have been in vain
[1:03:25] because it would not have done anything
[1:03:27] for us
[1:03:28] it was that resurrecting power that
[1:03:32] sealed it all
[1:03:34] amen it sealed the word of God forever
[1:03:37] it settled it when that one came and
[1:03:40] said I have power to lay my life down
[1:03:43] and I have power to take it up again and
[1:03:46] then go prove what he said he would do
[1:03:49] God purpose to prove his word the truth
[1:03:52] there's only one man that could do that
[1:03:54] and that was Jesus and he came and he
[1:03:57] proved it to be the truth it sealed it
[1:03:59] that broke the seals of glue it
[1:04:02] scattered all Superstition where great
[1:04:04] men had raised up and said great things
[1:04:06] and done marvelous things but still in
[1:04:09] the grave today but our Christian
[1:04:10] religion is the one that has an empty
[1:04:13] tomb
[1:04:15] not just a dead man and a grave and died
[1:04:19] for something for a good cause no but he
[1:04:21] raised again and he's still living among
[1:04:25] those
[1:04:30] it's the quickening power
[1:04:32] and that's what sets you apart from
[1:04:35] other religions
[1:04:38] you can raise the Dead
[1:04:40] you can do all kinds of things but if
[1:04:43] that quick and Empower ain't on the
[1:04:45] inside of you
[1:04:46] you're just as any other person
[1:04:49] any other religion
[1:04:51] come on now
[1:04:54] our Christian religion is the only one
[1:04:55] that has an empty tomb it proves to me
[1:04:57] that he's the god of the dead and he's
[1:05:00] the god of the living that he could
[1:05:02] raise up the dead and bring back to life
[1:05:04] in this quick and Empower is quickening
[1:05:06] Spirit has proved through the years that
[1:05:08] he's the one who can Quicken the dead
[1:05:11] back to life again oh my that's what's
[1:05:13] going to separate a bunch of people one
[1:05:15] day is the quickening power of the Holy
[1:05:17] Ghost amen not only to change their
[1:05:20] lives but also change their bodies
[1:05:25] come on now that is what's going to
[1:05:27] separate one religion from all other
[1:05:30] religions one belief from all other
[1:05:32] beliefs
[1:05:37] is the change of the body
[1:05:40] that's when he proved he had the pro he
[1:05:43] was by his promise that great quickening
[1:05:45] power conquering power he had on
[1:05:48] Resurrection mourning he proved there he
[1:05:50] can conquer death hell and the grave and
[1:05:54] then he said there in Revelation we read
[1:05:55] I am he that is dead but is alive again
[1:06:01] come on now and what what good is a dead
[1:06:04] God
[1:06:06] what good is a dead man somewhere in the
[1:06:08] Tomb
[1:06:09] Muhammad they got a dead man
[1:06:12] Buddha's got a dead man all these other
[1:06:15] major religions got dead men amen but we
[1:06:17] don't have just a dead man somewhere one
[1:06:20] day he's going to rise and one day he's
[1:06:21] going to do this and one day is going to
[1:06:23] come back no sir he is here Among Us
[1:06:27] he has risen from the dead and it proves
[1:06:29] to us that he has the keys to death hell
[1:06:33] and the grave therefore if I go by the
[1:06:36] way of the Grave he has the power to go
[1:06:39] across my ashes and raise me up again
[1:06:49] LeBron will say it like this and I was
[1:06:51] getting to that point I was making God
[1:06:54] hasten the day
[1:06:55] that when we as Christians who believe
[1:06:58] this Bible can prove what we're talking
[1:07:00] about
[1:07:02] when we can prove by our lives and by
[1:07:05] the Bible that our lives are vindicating
[1:07:08] that word to be living today that's the
[1:07:11] day we're looking for
[1:07:14] God living today not even living 50 60
[1:07:17] years ago God living today
[1:07:20] amen as he said in Romans 8 if the
[1:07:22] spirit that raised up Jesus Christ being
[1:07:25] you it'll also Quicken your mortal
[1:07:27] bodies not only did he prove to him to
[1:07:30] but he also proved to us that he was
[1:07:32] Jehovah Redeemer and had power over
[1:07:34] death hell in the grave but he also gave
[1:07:37] us the access to the Same Spirit
[1:07:40] to the same quickening power to the same
[1:07:43] life The Same Spirit that raised that
[1:07:46] body up from the grave is the same
[1:07:48] spirit that quickens you tonight
[1:07:53] for the spirit of the raised in Jesus
[1:07:55] from the grave dwells in your body it
[1:07:59] would also Quicken it
[1:08:01] or make it alive after death
[1:08:05] people want the quick and Empower but
[1:08:07] they don't want the death
[1:08:11] he can never get to the quickening power
[1:08:14] unless he went through the death
[1:08:16] and you will never get to the Holy Ghost
[1:08:19] the spirit of God unless you're willing
[1:08:21] to die
[1:08:24] unless you can come to that part and go
[1:08:27] Gethsemane it says Lord not my will
[1:08:30] but thy will be done
[1:08:32] not what I desire what I think is right
[1:08:35] but what you think is right not what I
[1:08:38] want but what you want not what I I'm
[1:08:40] I'm looking forward what you're looking
[1:08:42] for in Me God that's what I want
[1:08:47] oh but we want the power
[1:08:49] but what about the death
[1:08:54] I mean it's common sense if you go if
[1:08:58] you're going to be raised up in the
[1:08:59] resurrection you're going to have to die
[1:09:02] right you want to go by the way of the
[1:09:04] grave
[1:09:05] same in this in this life
[1:09:08] if you don't die now you won't raise
[1:09:10] then
[1:09:15] amen but see this world has been shut up
[1:09:18] in doubt
[1:09:21] but it was proven at that moment
[1:09:24] not only talked about but proven that
[1:09:26] Jesus said then and as Jesus said go
[1:09:29] therefore teach All Nations prove to
[1:09:32] them how you prove to them well I tell
[1:09:34] you what I got I got a bunch of degrees
[1:09:35] on my wall the message and I can tell
[1:09:37] you and I can bring it up and down one
[1:09:39] side of the other that ain't what he
[1:09:40] said by demonstration
[1:09:42] by demonstrating the power of God to
[1:09:46] them
[1:09:49] these signs shall follow them that
[1:09:51] believe them will promise and say they
[1:09:54] believe he give a definite understanding
[1:09:55] of that that these signs would follow
[1:09:58] them that believed it would be the proof
[1:10:01] of their testimony
[1:10:03] signs or wonders are proof that you
[1:10:06] truly believe
[1:10:10] well we don't need signs of wondering
[1:10:11] then you don't believe
[1:10:15] amen
[1:10:17] this ain't some crazy uh algebra here
[1:10:21] it's one plus one equals two
[1:10:25] well you know we we need greater things
[1:10:28] we'll start believing first
[1:10:32] amen it'd be proof of their testimony
[1:10:35] but until we have the proven sign that
[1:10:38] he said that would be upon us then we're
[1:10:41] just confessing to be Believers and not
[1:10:44] the possession of believers
[1:10:46] direct quote if you if you don't have
[1:10:49] that in your midst or in your body
[1:10:51] working among you then you're just
[1:10:53] confessing you believe
[1:10:59] it's one of the most fought after
[1:11:01] things
[1:11:03] brother Wayne just sent a quote on that
[1:11:05] I'm trying to remember it right off it's
[1:11:07] Mark 16.
[1:11:09] Go in all the world and preach the
[1:11:11] gospel
[1:11:13] preach demonstrate
[1:11:16] show people a living God
[1:11:19] well I ain't a preacher well you can do
[1:11:21] it at your work
[1:11:24] show them somebody that's died and rose
[1:11:26] again
[1:11:29] show them somebody that once was a life
[1:11:31] of of sin and Disobedience and
[1:11:34] fulfilling the lust of the flesh but now
[1:11:36] that old man's dead
[1:11:38] he don't live no more he don't do the
[1:11:42] things that you see he might have used
[1:11:43] to pull some dirty deals and cheap
[1:11:45] people out of money but that ain't what
[1:11:47] he does no more he died
[1:11:50] but now there's somebody else's rose
[1:11:52] again
[1:11:57] these signs shall follow them in all the
[1:11:59] world and every creature these signs
[1:12:01] shall follow them in my name they shall
[1:12:03] cast out Devils what do we do to Reuben
[1:12:06] we cast out devils
[1:12:08] it was demons there in his life of
[1:12:11] smoking and demons of of of drinking and
[1:12:14] demons of doping
[1:12:17] Demons of unbelief
[1:12:21] truly that's what happened the demon of
[1:12:23] unbelief got he got delivered from it
[1:12:27] for a long time he didn't believe he
[1:12:29] could be saved for a long time he didn't
[1:12:31] believe it was for him him and his
[1:12:32] family walked out years before but all
[1:12:35] of a sudden he had a need and he said if
[1:12:37] I can just get to Jesus and Touch the
[1:12:39] Hem of His Garment then we can be I can
[1:12:42] find healing for my wife something began
[1:12:44] to stir or something that caused him to
[1:12:47] believe
[1:12:50] and it comes that service and God
[1:12:52] anoints a man to go right down his life
[1:12:55] and call out the very thing that was
[1:12:57] going on
[1:12:59] bring him right to the same spot
[1:13:03] and I believe broke off of him he said
[1:13:07] God doesn't Hear My Cry God does know
[1:13:10] what I'm going through God does see who
[1:13:12] I have he's heard me
[1:13:16] come down that's next night and he said
[1:13:18] I want to serve a God who has Mercy like
[1:13:21] that that can come down to my Pew and
[1:13:24] Hear My Cry and then call out my knee I
[1:13:27] want to serve that God
[1:13:30] and we laid hands on him as the Bible
[1:13:32] said and we cast it off and God
[1:13:35] delivered the boy
[1:13:38] he's still in the delivering business
[1:13:43] that was his last commission to church
[1:13:49] they shall they shall cast out Devils
[1:13:51] speak with new tongues
[1:13:53] um
[1:13:54] yeah if they taken up deadly things
[1:13:57] serpents drinking a deadly thing it'll
[1:13:59] not harm them
[1:14:02] now
[1:14:04] I personally look at this this way
[1:14:08] if you happen to find something deadly
[1:14:11] I believe God can Overlook that
[1:14:14] and have mercy on it but I look at the
[1:14:16] things that we have to do today
[1:14:19] we have to tell we had to take a vaccine
[1:14:21] to travel you know what I only reason
[1:14:23] why I was wanting I would do it was to
[1:14:25] go to minister the gospel
[1:14:28] and I said Lord these signs shall follow
[1:14:30] them that believe if this thing is
[1:14:32] deadly it will not harm me
[1:14:35] medicines you have to take sometimes for
[1:14:38] certain situations Cancer all kinds of
[1:14:40] things that you got to do amen you can
[1:14:42] take it but I believe God can anoint
[1:14:44] that medicine to go to where the issue
[1:14:47] is
[1:14:48] amen and it not harm you but harm the
[1:14:52] sickness
[1:14:54] amen and they shall lay hands upon the
[1:14:56] sick and they shall recover they shall
[1:15:00] recover as his last commission to the
[1:15:03] church
[1:15:05] and it's still in effect
[1:15:07] doesn't matter what some preacher said
[1:15:09] it's still an effect doesn't matter what
[1:15:13] critics say it's still an effect
[1:15:16] it's the quickening power that was
[1:15:18] handed to the church
[1:15:24] Paul ordaining it years later in the
[1:15:27] church Galatians 1 said of angel from
[1:15:30] heaven preaches to you any other gospel
[1:15:32] than this which is already received let
[1:15:35] him be accursed
[1:15:40] foreign
[1:15:42] next sentence I believe this is
[1:15:46] 65. it's just in case you need to know
[1:15:49] hashtag notice the date
[1:15:54] next sentence I believe that Pentecost
[1:15:57] began without an
[1:16:02] I believe it's to be to every creature
[1:16:04] at all times at all plays that the
[1:16:07] Pentecost that Pentecost should always
[1:16:09] remain the Pentecostal blessing should
[1:16:13] always be upon the people
[1:16:18] Hallelujah and now what is this
[1:16:21] Pentecostal blessing it is the
[1:16:24] confirmation of the Resurrection
[1:16:29] so let Pentecost be a dirty word to you
[1:16:32] if you want to but as for me and my
[1:16:34] house I believe it ought to go to every
[1:16:36] mother every father ever son ever
[1:16:39] daughter
[1:16:40] every Church
[1:16:45] it is a confirmation of the Resurrection
[1:16:48] no wonder the gospel itself means good
[1:16:51] news good news good news of one he's
[1:16:55] raised from the dead
[1:16:58] well I've got cancer well I got good
[1:17:00] news he's raged from the dead
[1:17:04] come on somebody I got a son or a
[1:17:06] daughter out there lost I've got good
[1:17:09] news he is raised from the dead
[1:17:11] [Applause]
[1:17:13] I don't know what are you saying that
[1:17:15] for because death was the most evil
[1:17:17] thing and the greatest power that was
[1:17:20] held against man and God himself came
[1:17:23] down in human flesh and he put it under
[1:17:25] his foot
[1:17:27] and I'm reminded I'm reminded as brother
[1:17:30] Brandon would pray for that Maniac
[1:17:32] they're in Portland Oregon and he would
[1:17:34] cast that devil out and they would ask
[1:17:36] was he delivered he'd say no he worships
[1:17:39] that demon but he would say well you
[1:17:41] roll them off my feet and he would go up
[1:17:42] and he says as I was saying
[1:17:45] faith is a substance of things hoped for
[1:17:48] the evidence of things not sin and about
[1:17:50] that time somebody popped up out of a
[1:17:52] wheelchair and another one jumped off
[1:17:54] the car and another one ran screaming he
[1:17:56] said when about five minutes time every
[1:17:59] person in the building was delivered he
[1:18:01] said why he said cause that chief of
[1:18:04] that tribe of demons had made a
[1:18:06] challenge
[1:18:08] but he lost
[1:18:11] Lord of God but he lost
[1:18:14] death you lost
[1:18:18] you lost and when that Chief lost
[1:18:21] everyone under him fell also
[1:18:25] Hallelujah there's resurrection power
[1:18:28] that's among us tonight death you lost
[1:18:32] therefore cancer you lose
[1:18:35] lower the sugar diabetes you lose
[1:18:39] high blood pressure you lose sad you
[1:18:43] lose
[1:18:48] he's raised from the dead and because I
[1:18:51] live ye shall live also
[1:18:57] oh Jesus
[1:19:00] ye were who wants dead and sinned and
[1:19:02] trespasses God has quickened Us Together
[1:19:05] by the spirit that raised up Jesus from
[1:19:09] the dead we are now sitting in Heavenly
[1:19:11] places
[1:19:13] oh what a joy to tell people that story
[1:19:15] that believes it's the truth
[1:19:19] do you believe it to be the truth
[1:19:21] tonight
[1:19:22] foreign
[1:19:25] he said but I'm wondering
[1:19:27] what's really happening
[1:19:29] this is a very nice quote
[1:19:31] he said are we getting people to guard
[1:19:33] are we getting them to a church
[1:19:35] we must get them to Christ
[1:19:39] this quickening power
[1:19:41] oh it's good to go to church and sets as
[1:19:44] far as you go that's not far enough
[1:19:47] he said when you come to church that's
[1:19:48] good but go on to Christ because he must
[1:19:51] receive you must receive this quick and
[1:19:54] Empower if we're ever expected to be in
[1:19:56] that General Resurrection because it's
[1:19:58] the only one that ever bring us from the
[1:20:00] dead for if this spirit that raised up
[1:20:02] Jesus from the dead dwelling you it also
[1:20:05] Quicken you and bring your life bring
[1:20:07] life to your mortal bodies what a
[1:20:10] promise the very essence of their
[1:20:12] Resurrection is to tell and show and
[1:20:15] prove Jesus has raised from the dead
[1:20:18] he's not dead he's living and he lives
[1:20:22] here and he lives with us and I'll be
[1:20:25] with you even in you till the end of the
[1:20:27] world
[1:20:28] [Applause]
[1:20:33] as Christians we all claim he's alive
[1:20:37] well we've been quickened from life from
[1:20:40] Death To Life by Spirit but if we
[1:20:41] haven't been quickened then we haven't
[1:20:43] been made alive
[1:20:49] notice
[1:20:50] it's the same spirit
[1:20:52] that raised him up from the dead
[1:20:55] that raised him up from the grave
[1:20:58] that is dwelling in US
[1:20:59] how could that be the spirit that raised
[1:21:02] up Jesus from the dead is dwelling in us
[1:21:05] now it's the spirit that quickens
[1:21:09] it's the spirit as quick and it's not
[1:21:11] the word
[1:21:12] that quickens it's the spirit that
[1:21:14] quickens
[1:21:16] hello
[1:21:18] well we got the word we got the word we
[1:21:19] have to have the spirit too or the word
[1:21:21] is just dead
[1:21:24] it's the spirit that quickens the word
[1:21:26] or gives the word life it gives it wings
[1:21:30] to fly
[1:21:33] why does it need wings to fly because it
[1:21:35] needs to fly over there to where that
[1:21:37] Devil's sitting on your property and
[1:21:39] bomb him
[1:21:43] come on now you can say it all you want
[1:21:45] to you can say it you can say it you can
[1:21:47] say it and you say but if the spirit
[1:21:48] ain't in that word
[1:21:50] it don't have wings to fly
[1:21:53] it don't have it gonna fall hit the
[1:21:55] ground but if there's spirit that comes
[1:21:57] with that word it's going to fly
[1:22:00] and listen God had a home and device way
[1:22:04] before man ever ever invented one he
[1:22:07] knows exactly where to go to somebody
[1:22:09] and to something he knows exactly where
[1:22:12] that Devil's been camping out on your
[1:22:14] little spot and he's been camping down
[1:22:16] and he's clamped down on your joy or
[1:22:18] he's clamped down on your happiness and
[1:22:20] your peace he's clamped down on on the
[1:22:22] things of life in your heart and you
[1:22:24] wonder what amen but if you can just
[1:22:26] ever get into the spirit of God and let
[1:22:29] it begin to move on the inside of you
[1:22:31] amen a little later I've mentioned it
[1:22:33] last last week but Lord will we'll get
[1:22:35] there amen this sword is a two-mile
[1:22:37] sword it's got to be spoke from the word
[1:22:39] of God from God's lips and then it's got
[1:22:42] to go on the believer's lips
[1:22:44] come on now it's got to be you speaking
[1:22:47] it but not just speaking a letter or
[1:22:49] speaking something laying there on paper
[1:22:51] but something become inspired to you and
[1:22:54] the spirit quickened and say hey that's
[1:22:56] what I'm going through that's what's
[1:22:58] happening right now I want to speak it
[1:23:00] in the name of Jesus and you watch it
[1:23:02] Wings will come out of there and then
[1:23:04] start honing in on that devil and then
[1:23:06] start bombing him and bombing him and
[1:23:08] vomiting until he's obliterated out of
[1:23:10] your life
[1:23:11] [Music]
[1:23:19] it's the spirit that does that
[1:23:21] second Corinthians 3 6 says who also
[1:23:25] hath made us able Ministers of the New
[1:23:27] Testament
[1:23:29] not of the letter but of the spirit
[1:23:32] for the letter killeth but the spirit
[1:23:35] given life
[1:23:37] so it's not just receiving a letter
[1:23:41] got to receive the spirit
[1:23:45] otherwise it's just dead Creeds and
[1:23:48] dullness ideas it's been passed on by
[1:23:51] traditions of men down through ages
[1:23:55] and you're just
[1:23:56] taking it all in
[1:23:58] no no we we need more than that we need
[1:24:01] the spirit of God
[1:24:03] you see a wheat seed is just a wheat
[1:24:05] seed
[1:24:06] until the life gets quickened that's on
[1:24:09] the inside of it then it brings forth
[1:24:12] other life
[1:24:13] amen which we were when we were once
[1:24:15] Dead made in the image of God yet dead
[1:24:18] dead and sins and trespasses there was
[1:24:20] some way God had to get this quickening
[1:24:22] life into our mortal bodies I'm talking
[1:24:26] about your body
[1:24:30] now as a promised Messiah he quickened
[1:24:33] every word that was prophesied that he
[1:24:35] would do he healed the sick he how he
[1:24:37] would be born of a virgin it was true he
[1:24:39] was the word manifested here on Earth
[1:24:41] but he could not do just that as a as
[1:24:44] man it took the spirit of God dwelling
[1:24:46] on the inside of him to Quicken these
[1:24:48] promises to him he said I hope that we
[1:24:50] get this real clear Jesus being a man
[1:24:53] himself the body but it took the spirit
[1:24:55] in him it's not me that doeth the work
[1:24:58] but my father that dwelleth in me he's
[1:25:01] the one that does the work Jesus himself
[1:25:04] was the word because he was but he was
[1:25:06] predestinated by the foreknowledge of
[1:25:08] God how God's plan was to be he was sent
[1:25:10] a redeemer and this Redeemer only could
[1:25:12] be his own son and then God's promise
[1:25:15] all the way from the Garden of Eden that
[1:25:16] Jesus would be here and he was a man
[1:25:19] born of a virgin but it took the spirit
[1:25:21] of God to Quicken the word to him
[1:25:25] so if it's going to take the spirit to
[1:25:27] Quicken it to Jesus it's going to take
[1:25:29] the spirit to Quicken it to you
[1:25:32] that's why we got to make sure that we
[1:25:35] don't do anything to hinder the spirit
[1:25:36] when he moves
[1:25:39] yes
[1:25:49] he said he was the word quickened for
[1:25:52] that hour the time had come when you
[1:25:54] would have to have a redeemer
[1:25:56] the law had failed all things other
[1:25:58] things had failed it takes a redeemer he
[1:26:00] was quickened to that by the spirit
[1:26:04] and he said that that same spirit that
[1:26:07] was upon him to be the Redeemer in that
[1:26:10] age
[1:26:11] that we have accepted now the promises
[1:26:13] of this last day what would take place
[1:26:15] and you become a part of that word and
[1:26:18] you're redeemed with him because the
[1:26:20] same spirit that dwelt in him is now
[1:26:23] dwelling in you
[1:26:25] and is quick and in your life to this
[1:26:28] age
[1:26:31] it would be nice if some of your lives
[1:26:33] will get quick into a service
[1:26:38] but he said he gone quicker to this age
[1:26:42] Quicken your mortal bodies resurrect you
[1:26:45] bring them up again and that takes away
[1:26:48] the Gloom that we're looking at
[1:26:51] oh God
[1:26:53] oh my yes brother Timothy the Gloom did
[1:26:56] you not see what's going on in the world
[1:26:58] and all the things that are happening
[1:26:59] what is Gloom Gloom is partial or total
[1:27:03] darkness it's a dark shadowy place it's
[1:27:07] a loness of spirit
[1:27:11] is a dejection an atmosphere of
[1:27:15] despondency
[1:27:22] let me read a few on Gloom I kind of
[1:27:24] just broke into this study right at the
[1:27:25] last
[1:27:27] so may the spirit of the Lord Jesus
[1:27:29] Christ move down
[1:27:30] what he said the spirit of the Lord
[1:27:34] Jesus Christ moved down and settle down
[1:27:36] and come over this audience
[1:27:39] and all the glooms of fear and doubt and
[1:27:44] unbelief be moved all away
[1:27:48] just a touch of your presence and they
[1:27:51] will receive it just move the Gloom back
[1:27:54] enough
[1:27:55] that our spiritual eyes can be opened to
[1:27:59] see what's standing in the building
[1:28:01] tonight
[1:28:04] Amen to where we can see you and your
[1:28:07] presence is omnipotent
[1:28:12] oh Hallelujah and when omnipotence
[1:28:15] speaks Miracles take place
[1:28:16] [Applause]
[1:28:18] hallelujah amen I say God may may be all
[1:28:22] the Gloom that we've seen around us and
[1:28:25] the world and things that are going on
[1:28:27] we're going to get there why what that
[1:28:28] gloom's there for amen it's there for a
[1:28:30] purpose amen but let it be just pushed
[1:28:33] back
[1:28:35] in the service tonight
[1:28:37] and all of a sudden we don't see our son
[1:28:40] that's been sitting out there away from
[1:28:42] God we see him right here at altar
[1:28:47] we don't see our body all wore down by
[1:28:50] sickness and some disease maybe cancer
[1:28:52] sugar diabetes or something but all of a
[1:28:55] sudden we see our body well
[1:28:59] and we begin to walk into it and we
[1:29:02] begin to move that direction why because
[1:29:05] it's something quickened to us
[1:29:07] but all the glooms got to be driven back
[1:29:11] that's why brother Tim said the other
[1:29:13] day you've got to fight
[1:29:16] the Devil comes in every service to try
[1:29:19] to put down doubt and fear and unbelief
[1:29:21] and try to say whether this is just a
[1:29:23] Wednesday night no need to get it to get
[1:29:25] all worked up or get excited to get
[1:29:26] enthused about nothing it's work
[1:29:28] tomorrow and you got bills to pay and
[1:29:30] you got this to do and you got that to
[1:29:32] do and you got this going on you got
[1:29:34] next week and you got next month of what
[1:29:35] we're going to do next year 10 years
[1:29:36] around the road where are you going to
[1:29:37] be
[1:29:40] settling down with Gloom
[1:29:42] but if we can let the spirit of God
[1:29:44] begin to move
[1:29:46] as it would move over the Earth that we
[1:29:48] stand at home as they're set in a dark
[1:29:50] place and it was all in a dark a messed
[1:29:54] up condition and God said let there be
[1:29:57] light and the spirit will move down with
[1:30:00] that word and to begin to woo
[1:30:04] and they begin to move this direction
[1:30:06] and woo it'll move over here and it woo
[1:30:10] then the preacher would go down this
[1:30:11] road and it would woo and it would come
[1:30:13] back over here and he would woo
[1:30:16] what's he trying to do get seeds to come
[1:30:18] out of the dark
[1:30:20] get seeds to come out of the light out
[1:30:23] of the darkness into the light get seeds
[1:30:26] to rise up above the muck of the world
[1:30:28] and all the things the devil tries to
[1:30:31] put if we could just get that enough
[1:30:34] we could see there's angels of Fire
[1:30:39] they've come into this place like
[1:30:40] lightning
[1:30:42] and they've come into our midst and they
[1:30:44] said hey that seal that's held you is
[1:30:47] not going to hold you no more
[1:30:49] that thing that's kept you in it's not
[1:30:51] going to hold you there no more that
[1:30:53] Pride that arrogance that's the that's

[1:33:10] with his wife he was in a lot of Gloom
[1:33:13] just a few months before his dad had
[1:33:16] been taken away off the scene

[1:33:19] and a wonderful Christian man lovely man
[1:33:22] lovely spirit

[1:34:08] redwoods or Sequoia is out there in
[1:34:10] California how did they drop seeds down
[1:34:13] to the ground and then it's proven that
[1:34:15] it takes fire for those seeds to come to
[1:34:18] life if they don't get that atmosphere
[1:34:20] that burning of fire they never come and
[1:34:23] become Mighty trees I said but here

[1:39:48] cause you to give your life take your
[1:39:51] life
[1:39:53] but there's a spirit that's moved in
[1:39:54] this building
[1:39:56] and it's moving down and it's touching
[1:39:58] hearts and it's touching life it's ah
[1:40:00] that ain't for you
[1:40:02] you're my child
[1:40:05] you're my son
[1:40:07] you're my daughter you're mine
[1:40:12] I'll never forget as I was in
[1:40:16] Poland one time preaching through a a
[1:40:19] woman interpreter they didn't have
[1:40:20] nobody else she was a teacher of English
[1:40:22] and she was translating the message and
[1:40:25] God had dealt me with me has a longer
[1:40:27] store but just a short of it on the on
[1:40:29] the preacher thought and let my people
[1:40:31] go
[1:40:32] and I began to speak about some of these
[1:40:34] very things of gloom and doubts and
[1:40:36] unbeliefs and I said some he wants to
[1:40:39] take all the way down to suicide
[1:40:42] and he wants to take their life and take
[1:40:44] them to a early grave
[1:40:46] and I'm preaching long then I've
[1:40:47] realized
[1:40:49] I lost her she ain't she's not
[1:40:51] translating to look at her tears just
[1:40:53] coming she's got her head and her hands
[1:40:54] and her head her head in her hands she's
[1:40:56] crying and she said give me a minute
[1:40:58] brother Timothy and she starts mumbling
[1:41:00] the words and trying to keep back up and
[1:41:03] I'll just lay my hand over and begin to
[1:41:04] pray for her and as God began to move in
[1:41:07] that building she would later testify to
[1:41:09] me in a car on her way to the pastor's
[1:41:11] house with a pastor and his wife and
[1:41:13] she's translating she would tell me in
[1:41:14] English she said brother Timothy just
[1:41:16] this very weak I try to take my life I
[1:41:20] try to end it all I said ain't nothing I
[1:41:22] got to give for God I said but now it's
[1:41:24] heard the words tonight that I have been
[1:41:27] set free
[1:41:28] and I want you to know brother too and
[1:41:30] then you came so this Gloom could be
[1:41:33] broke off my life oh hallelujah
[1:41:36] hallelujah that's why I'm here tonight
[1:41:39] I'm here to break blue off of your life
