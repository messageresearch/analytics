========================================

[Music] When the music fades and all is stripped away and I simply home. [Music] Longing just to bring something that's of worth that will bless your heart. [Music] I'll bring you more than a song. For a song in itself is not what you have required. [Music] You search much deeper within through the way things appear. You're looking into my heart. [Music] I'm coming back to the heart of worship. And it's all about you. Oh, it's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I made it when it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. [Music] King of endless worth. No one could express how much you deserve. [Music] Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is yours. Every single breath [Music] I'll bring you. More than a song for a song in itself is not what you have required. You search much deeper within through the way things appear. You're looking into my heart. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. And it's all about you. Oh, it's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've made. When it's all about you, it's all about you, Jesus. [Music] You're worthy of it all. [Music] You're worthy of it all. [Music] For from you are all things and to you are all things. You deserve the glory. [Music] You're worthy of it all.

You are worthy of it all. You're worthy of it all. Yes. From you are all things and to you are all things. Lord, you deserve it. You deserve my worship, Father. You deserve my praise. Say you're worthy of it all. Oh, you're worthy of it all. of your own. [Music] Yes, you deserve the glory. [Music] Yes, you're worthy of it all. You're worthy of it all. [Music] Oh, and from you all.

Lord, you've given me the very breath that I use to praise your name. And I just want to tell you, you're worthy. Hallelujah. You deserve the glory. [Music] [Applause] Sing one more time. You're worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; Worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're worthy of it all. [Music] Oh, from you are all things. To you are all things. You deserve the glory.
