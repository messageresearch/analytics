[47:17] and victory was wrought and that you
[47:20] brought salvation to that house lord
[47:25] now her old worn tired body
[47:28] has now been laid to rest and she's
[47:31] changed coats now
[47:33] it's a temporary code in a way because
[47:35] it's a theophany
[47:37] that will come one day to pick up the
[47:39] old worn body and glorify it
[47:42] and shall be also changed and we'll be
[47:45] changed with them
[47:47] but lord today i pray that your comfort
[47:49] of the holy spirit will just be ours
[47:52] today
[47:52] as we kind of draw up the belt
[47:56] and step in line and others step in line
[47:59] and realize
[48:01] that we still got a battle to fight and
[48:03] a race to finish
[48:05] and i asked god that you would bless the
[48:08] family lord
[48:09] each one and comfort them in this time
[48:12] and give them that assurance
[48:14] that the loved one that they seen go
[48:16] away
[48:17] will come back again i ask lord your
[48:20] blessings today on this service now
[48:23] that you would anoint it lord with your
[48:25] your presence
[48:27] and that you would speak through us and
[48:29] to us and that you would just
[48:31] reveal your word to us may it be real
[48:34] as we look into the pages of the
[48:37] scripture
[48:38] may you may it be that you opened up our
[48:41] understanding
[48:43] so that we could see the hope of our
[48:45] calling i ask for your anointing today

[48:50] could take the scripture and i could
[48:52] read it

[52:20] chapter 3
[52:21] and we're going to read from verse 1
[52:23] this morning
[52:24] i'm going to be speaking on revealed by
[52:27] the angel
[52:28] we have been speaking about the angel of
[52:30] the lord and
[52:31] and his great work that he's done in
[52:34] this last day
[52:35] we're going to just look into the
[52:37] scripture today as we
[52:39] see things that are applicable to our
[52:41] age and time
[52:43] exodus chapter 3 verse 1 now moses
[52:46] kept the flock of jethro his
[52:48] father-in-law the priest of midian
[52:50] and he led the flock to the backside of
[52:53] the desert and came to the mountain of
[52:54] god even to horeb
[52:56] and the angel of the lord appeared to
[52:58] him in a flame of fire
[53:00] out of the midst of a bush and he looked
[53:03] and
[53:04] behold the bush burned with fire and the
[53:07] bush was not
[53:08] consumed and moses said i will now
[53:11] turn aside and see this uh great sight
[53:15] why the bush is not burnt and when
[53:18] the lord saw that he had turned aside
[53:21] to see god called him out of the midst
[53:24] of the bush
[53:25] and moses and said moses moses and he
[53:28] said
[53:29] here am i and he said draw not nigh
[53:32] hitter
[53:33] put off thy shoes from off that feet for
[53:35] the place whereon thou
[53:36] standeth is holy ground moreover he said
[53:40] i am the god of thy father the god of
[53:42] abraham the god of isaac
[53:44] and the god of jacob and moses hid his
[53:47] face
[53:47] for he was afraid to look upon god
[53:51] and the lord said i have surely seen the
[53:54] affliction of my people
[53:56] which are in egypt and have heard their
[53:58] cry by reason
[53:59] of their task masters for i know their
[54:02] sorrows
[54:03] and i am come down to deliver them out
[54:06] of the hand of the egyptians
[54:08] and to bring them up out of that land
[54:10] into a good land and a large
[54:12] and to a land flowing with milk and
[54:15] honey
[54:16] and to the place of the canaanites and
[54:18] the hittites
[54:19] and the amorites and the perizzites and
[54:22] the hivites and the jebusites
[54:24] now therefore behold the cry
[54:27] of the children of israel has come unto
[54:30] me
[54:31] and i've also seen the oppression
[54:33] wherewith the
[54:34] egyptians oppressed them come now
[54:37] therefore and i will send thee
[54:38] unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring
[54:41] forth
[54:41] my people the children of israel out of
[54:44] egypt
[54:45] and moses said unto god who am i
[54:49] that i should go unto pharaoh and that i
[54:51] should bring forth the children of
[54:53] israel
[54:53] out of egypt and he said certainly i
[54:56] will be with thee
[54:57] and this shall be a token unto thee that
[55:00] i have sent
[55:01] thee when thou has brought forth the
[55:03] people out of egypt
[55:05] ye shall serve god upon this mountain
[55:09] and moses said unto god behold when i
[55:11] come unto the children of israel and say
[55:13] unto them the god of your fathers
[55:16] has sent sent me unto you and they shall
[55:19] say to me
[55:21] what is his name and what shall i
[55:24] say unto them and god said
[55:27] unto moses i am that i
[55:30] am and he said thus saith
[55:34] thou thus shalt thou say unto the
[55:36] children of israel
[55:37] i am has sent me unto you
[55:40] and god said moreover unto moses
[55:44] thus shall thou say unto the children of
[55:47] israel the lord god of your fathers
[55:49] the god of abraham the god of isaac and
[55:52] the god of jacob
[55:53] has sent me unto you this is my name
[55:57] forever and this is my memorial
[56:00] unto all generations amen may god bless
[56:04] you you can be seated
[56:07] and certainly we ask his blessings upon
[56:09] the word today
[56:11] uh before that we go into the scripture
[56:15] today i thought i would share with you
[56:18] some of you may have already heard this
[56:20] but on
[56:21] sunday february the 14th brother ron
[56:24] spencer had a dream where him and his
[56:27] family were
[56:28] invited to a meeting it was a small
[56:30] building but
[56:31] it was a massive crowd and his family
[56:35] and his wife sister connie the boys were
[56:38] sitting beside him
[56:39] in a row um very near the stage
[56:43] and brother ron was sitting on the edge
[56:45] of the aisle
[56:46] and yet little did they know that
[56:49] brother branham was to be
[56:50] the speaker brother branham was dressed
[56:53] uh in a very
[56:54] beautiful whitish suit he was young
[56:57] and the color of his suit was really
[56:59] hard to describe
[57:01] but it was a shade between ivory and
[57:04] um white and and the garment was unlike
[57:07] anything
[57:08] that he had ever seen it looked
[57:10] incredibly comfortable
[57:12] and you know as he came to the stage
[57:15] brother branham didn't
[57:17] actually preach but he just told a few
[57:19] stories it seemed
[57:20] and it seemed like in the background you
[57:23] could hear the humming from another
[57:25] realm
[57:26] and humming from an unseen dimension was
[57:29] was a song on the wings of a snow white
[57:33] dove
[57:34] right after he finished speaking brother
[57:36] branham walked over to him with a green
[57:38] colored book
[57:39] in his hand and his title was the way of
[57:41] a true prophet
[57:42] it was one of those original um
[57:45] spoken word books and it was um this
[57:49] sermon that his dad brother charlie
[57:51] spencer had listened to when he first
[57:53] came to know brother branham was a
[57:55] prophet and
[57:56] it was a sermon played in in the
[57:59] spencer home many times and brother
[58:01] branham
[58:02] asked brother ron would you like to have
[58:04] this book
[58:05] and he held it out for him to take and
[58:08] and
[58:09] as he did he looked into brother
[58:11] branham's eyes and said
[58:12] brother branham i have believed this
[58:15] message
[58:16] all of my life and i preached it all
[58:18] over the world
[58:20] and i tried my best brother branham
[58:24] and and he looked at him and said ronald
[58:27] and he patted him on the cheek like that
[58:28] and said
[58:29] you're going to be well and then they
[58:32] walked out of the building and brother
[58:34] branham asked him
[58:35] would you like to have your picture
[58:36] taken with me and he said i sure would
[58:38] brother branham i'd love to have my
[58:40] picture taken with you so he stood right
[58:42] beside him
[58:43] and the boys and connie were there and
[58:45] brother branham standing beside him and
[58:47] he just reached over and patted brother
[58:49] ron on the shoulder
[58:50] and he said homer and that's his
[58:52] father-in-law who's already went on to
[58:54] be with the lord
[58:55] he said he will be here in just a few
[58:57] more moments
[58:59] amen i'll tell you you know i think that
[59:02] is very very fitting
[59:04] um you know as they as he listened in
[59:06] that dream
[59:08] to the humming from another realm of a
[59:10] unseen dimension
[59:12] on the wings of a snow white dove
[59:15] i can remember the year was 1965
[59:19] i was 11 years old i sat on my
[59:22] edge of my seat in rapt attention
[59:26] there in shreveport louisiana as brother
[59:28] branham
[59:29] preached that sermon on the wings of a
[59:32] snow white dove and
[59:34] when he when he got to the end that my
[59:36] young heart almost
[59:37] burst as he as he began to tell of a
[59:40] verse that he had written to that song
[59:43] and i thought it was very very
[59:45] fitting to go with the dream though i
[59:48] have suffered
[59:49] in many a way i've cried for healing
[59:52] both night and day but faith wasn't
[59:55] forgotten
[59:56] by the father above he sent down his
[59:59] sign
[1:00:00] on the wings of a dove and just this
[1:00:03] week
[1:00:04] you know um brother ron as brother
[1:00:07] timothy said
[1:00:08] had a battery of tests later he would
[1:00:11] get a
[1:00:11] call from the cancer clinic and the
[1:00:14] doctor said
[1:00:15] you know i've saved the miracle call
[1:00:17] today for the
[1:00:18] my last call today he said
[1:00:21] no new cancer the spots in the kidney
[1:00:24] that we thought was cancer
[1:00:26] whatever that is is all gone and um
[1:00:29] and so you know we we they just told him
[1:00:33] to keep the course
[1:00:34] and continue on and of course in a
[1:00:37] couple more months they'll have another
[1:00:38] brain scan
[1:00:40] and we're expecting them to all be gone
[1:00:42] amen
[1:00:44] and we believe the word of god now we
[1:00:47] believe his promise
[1:00:48] and we're thankful even for the
[1:00:50] visitations of the lord when he
[1:00:53] comes and just drops a little something
[1:00:56] in us to help us
[1:00:57] along the journey amen now
[1:01:01] as we have read the scripture today the
[1:01:04] we read about a pillar of fire or
[1:01:08] fire in a bush that not did not burn it
[1:01:11] was
[1:01:12] called there a flame of fire and it
[1:01:15] appeared to
[1:01:16] moses there and and
[1:01:19] moses after the discourse that he had
[1:01:22] with him
[1:01:23] that he he asked the question
[1:01:26] you know when they shall say to me what
[1:01:29] is his name
[1:01:30] what shall i say unto them and god said
[1:01:34] to moses
[1:01:34] i am that i am and he said thou shall
[1:01:37] say the children of israel
[1:01:39] i am has sent me unto you
[1:01:42] this is a wonderful name of god and it's
[1:01:45] represented in the text as a
[1:01:49] a tetragrammaton the tetragrammaton
[1:01:53] is a greek word for four letters
[1:01:57] it is in in the hebrew writing
[1:02:00] it is um the best we can translate it
[1:02:03] into english because
[1:02:05] um letters differ slightly from our
[1:02:08] alphabet
[1:02:10] that um it is it is y-h-y-h-w-h
[1:02:16] and so it's a four consonants of the
[1:02:19] ancient hebrew name for god is also
[1:02:22] translated again
[1:02:23] as as j h v h
[1:02:26] because the hebrews and english letters
[1:02:28] don't match exactly
[1:02:30] but um strangely enough the exact
[1:02:34] pronunciation pronunciation of yh
[1:02:38] wa is not now known it it
[1:02:42] occurs in various written and spoken
[1:02:45] forms
[1:02:46] some will pronounce it as yahweh or
[1:02:49] jehovah
[1:02:51] and about vocalizing these four letters
[1:02:54] the jews say as an expression of
[1:02:58] infinite greatness and majesty of god it
[1:03:00] was held to be unpronounceable
[1:03:03] and hence was replaced during the
[1:03:05] reading of the sacred scripture
[1:03:07] by the means of the use of the altered
[1:03:10] name
[1:03:10] adonai which means um lord
[1:03:14] so in other words they wouldn't say this
[1:03:16] name they got where they wouldn't say
[1:03:18] this name
[1:03:19] and they would just put in for that name
[1:03:22] the name
[1:03:23] the name lord now you see it was on
[1:03:26] account of the original
[1:03:28] uh understanding of the third
[1:03:31] commandment
[1:03:32] they had changed that that began to say
[1:03:35] that said you shall not take the name of
[1:03:37] the lord your god in vain
[1:03:40] so you see and of course that meant that
[1:03:43] we was to keep
[1:03:44] our vows when swearing by god's name but
[1:03:47] but israel's anxious sages
[1:03:50] and their rabbis that begin to
[1:03:53] reinterpret this
[1:03:55] to mean even using the lord's name
[1:03:58] lightly or frivolously and to avoid the
[1:04:02] risk of employing the divine name
[1:04:04] irreverently the sages ruled that one
[1:04:08] should not
[1:04:08] uttered at all and eventually
[1:04:12] the only time this name could be said
[1:04:15] was in the temple and then eventually
[1:04:18] only the priests were allowed to say
[1:04:21] that sacred name
[1:04:23] and then when the temple was destroyed
[1:04:25] and the jews were taken
[1:04:26] captive down to babylon the exact
[1:04:30] pronunciation of the letters were lost
[1:04:32] because it's all consonants it has
[1:04:34] no vowels to it and so
[1:04:37] you know they lost even how to say
[1:04:40] the sacred name of god and again
[1:04:44] you know um this was because the jewish
[1:04:48] sages
[1:04:49] misinterpreted the third commandment
[1:04:53] so the pronunciation of the name was
[1:04:56] lost and soon
[1:04:57] nobody knew how to say this but i want
[1:05:00] to just declare
[1:05:01] we know the name of the i am god
[1:05:05] and his name is jesus and that name
[1:05:09] rebukes sickness it heals diseases
[1:05:12] it casts out devils it saves sinners
[1:05:16] and that name contains the essence
[1:05:19] of the i am that i am because he's
[1:05:22] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:05:25] and forever
[1:05:27] now why is it important to know the name
[1:05:30] of god
[1:05:30] is jesus you see the name of jesus is
[1:05:33] god's
[1:05:34] representative of judgment that christ
[1:05:38] has
[1:05:38] already judged for your sins and
[1:05:41] sickness
[1:05:42] and your temptations so when you
[1:05:45] when you pray in the name of jesus and
[1:05:48] you speak that name
[1:05:50] you are speaking of god's representation
[1:05:53] where your price of redemption was paid
[1:05:57] for
[1:05:57] your healing was paid for your sickness
[1:06:00] was paid for
[1:06:01] your sins were paid for and that christ
[1:06:04] all
[1:06:04] was judged for your temptation and for
[1:06:07] your sickness
[1:06:08] but i want to declare to you that jesus
[1:06:11] is
[1:06:11] the i am this one that we're reading
[1:06:15] about that appeared
[1:06:16] in the burning bush of fire who said
[1:06:20] i his name was i am that i am
[1:06:24] to tell them i am has sent you
[1:06:27] that that jesus is that great i am if
[1:06:32] you look with me in john chapter 8 and
[1:06:34] verse 24
[1:06:35] he said i said unto you that you will
[1:06:38] die in your sins
[1:06:39] for if you believe not that i am
[1:06:42] he ye shall die in your sins
[1:06:46] now that pronoun he if you're looking at
[1:06:48] the king james version it was added by
[1:06:50] the
[1:06:51] kjv translators to make the reading more
[1:06:54] understandable but the original text
[1:06:56] says if you believe not that i am
[1:07:00] amen you will die in your sins
[1:07:04] now you again this is going to be
[1:07:08] very applicable to our last day
[1:07:11] because we must believe in the i am god
[1:07:15] not the i was not the i will be though
[1:07:18] he
[1:07:18] was and he will be but he is
[1:07:21] he is today the i am and every day
[1:07:25] wherever day you come to he is the i am
[1:07:29] god he's never known as i was or that i
[1:07:32] will
[1:07:33] he will always be there i am jesus
[1:07:36] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:07:37] forever
[1:07:38] revelation 1 17 and when i saw him
[1:07:42] i fell at his feet as dead
[1:07:45] and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:07:47] saying fear not
[1:07:49] i am the first and the last
[1:07:52] i am he that liveth and was dead
[1:07:56] and behold i am alive forevermore
[1:07:59] amen and have the keys of hell and of
[1:08:02] death
[1:08:03] so three times in the book of revelation
[1:08:06] he has declared himself
[1:08:08] as the i am amen he's a
[1:08:11] he is i am that liveth he is
[1:08:14] uh i am the person to last and
[1:08:18] he says i am alive forevermore
[1:08:21] and these are very key to what god has
[1:08:25] done
[1:08:25] in this day and hour in order to show
[1:08:28] himself alive with infallible proofs
[1:08:31] of his resurrection i'd like to share
[1:08:33] with you a quotation from israel in the
[1:08:35] church
[1:08:36] brother branham says i have come down to
[1:08:38] deliver them
[1:08:39] i am delivered declaring my name tell
[1:08:43] them that will be a memorial
[1:08:44] through all generations that i am
[1:08:48] the i am not that i was or that i will
[1:08:52] be
[1:08:52] i am the same god that was there that
[1:08:56] night
[1:08:56] is here tonight and i'm to now i'm going
[1:08:59] before you i'm going to send my angel
[1:09:02] and he's going to be in a pillar of fire
[1:09:04] and i'm going to send him before you now
[1:09:06] as a pillar of fire and he will lead you
[1:09:09] a pillar of fire so big like a pillar a
[1:09:12] pillar of fire shall go before you
[1:09:14] to lead you i am will be in that pillar
[1:09:18] of fire
[1:09:20] now in the paradox message he said when
[1:09:23] jesus on the earth
[1:09:25] he said i come from god and i
[1:09:28] go to god and we know that he was the i
[1:09:32] am
[1:09:33] and the i am was that logos
[1:09:36] that pillar of fire and that when he
[1:09:39] went back to god
[1:09:40] and ascended upon high saw of tarsus was
[1:09:43] on his road down to damascus one day
[1:09:45] and that same light fell in before him
[1:09:48] and blinded him
[1:09:50] so now we know then that that hear the i
[1:09:53] am god showing himself in the pillar of
[1:09:56] fire
[1:09:57] and and he will he would declare himself
[1:10:00] i
[1:10:00] am jesus there is no
[1:10:04] difference if i can say it that way no
[1:10:07] difference between the i am god and
[1:10:09] jesus jesus
[1:10:10] is the i am now
[1:10:14] brother branham was asked in in question
[1:10:16] answer 64
[1:10:18] has the name of the lord changed in
[1:10:20] different dispensations and he said yes
[1:10:22] he was he was once called he was called
[1:10:25] the i am he's called
[1:10:27] jehovah he's changed many times the last
[1:10:29] time
[1:10:30] it was changed was when god became flesh
[1:10:34] and took a human name and jehovah
[1:10:38] the i am and all those titles are the
[1:10:40] titles to a name
[1:10:42] and if he was baptized in the name of
[1:10:44] jehovah it would have to be in the name
[1:10:46] of jesus christ
[1:10:48] if you were baptized in the name of
[1:10:50] jehovah rapha or jehovah manassas or
[1:10:52] jehovah jiren
[1:10:53] or all of those it would have to be
[1:10:56] jesus christ that i am is
[1:11:00] jesus christ remember standing there
[1:11:03] that day you say
[1:11:04] the he said you say you ate man in the
[1:11:06] wilderness
[1:11:07] and our fathers ate man in the
[1:11:09] wilderness he said they're dead said
[1:11:11] and and and he would stand on that there
[1:11:13] and let me just go on in that
[1:11:15] scripture he said before abraham was i
[1:11:18] am
[1:11:20] and he said we all know you're crazy
[1:11:23] because you're just a man
[1:11:25] and not over 50 years old and you say
[1:11:27] you seen abraham
[1:11:29] and he said before abraham was i am and
[1:11:31] he said
[1:11:32] he was the i am and all the titles
[1:11:36] that ever belong to god was made
[1:11:39] one human name the lord
[1:11:42] jesus christ think of that
[1:11:46] all the titles that ever belong to god
[1:11:49] whether you think of elohim
[1:11:50] melchizedek el shaddai
[1:11:54] or or jehovah and all the different um
[1:11:57] attributes of jehovah jehovah shalom
[1:11:59] jehovah zarah
[1:12:00] jehovah and manasseh or whatever or
[1:12:02] jehovah
[1:12:04] whatever it is all of those titles
[1:12:06] belong to god
[1:12:08] now so you again and that not only
[1:12:11] belonged to god but they belong
[1:12:13] to jesus christ amen because
[1:12:16] god all the names that ever belonged to
[1:12:20] god was made one
[1:12:21] human name the lord jesus
[1:12:24] christ and the anointed ones at the end
[1:12:27] time
[1:12:28] he would say we see plainly
[1:12:31] after the seven seals have been opened
[1:12:34] that's to reveal
[1:12:35] that mystery now remember those seals
[1:12:38] were revealed by the lamb
[1:12:40] as the seventh angel uh seven angel
[1:12:43] ministering spirits of god brought the
[1:12:45] revelation
[1:12:47] and the way revelation is supposed to
[1:12:50] come revelation is to come
[1:12:52] through a prophet amen now then he says
[1:12:56] but what is the trinity
[1:12:57] see where was it ever called the trinity
[1:13:00] where in the bible does it even speak
[1:13:01] the word trinity of course
[1:13:03] we know it doesn't right and then
[1:13:06] there's not a
[1:13:06] place in the bible it speaks of a
[1:13:09] trinity
[1:13:10] or even even refers to the the word
[1:13:13] trinity
[1:13:14] but he said where could there be three
[1:13:16] gods that we worship three gods and not
[1:13:18] be heathen
[1:13:20] amen because hero is the lord thy god is
[1:13:23] one lord amen how can they be
[1:13:26] separate and when he said i my father
[1:13:29] are one
[1:13:30] except you believe that i am he you will
[1:13:33] die in
[1:13:34] your sins your unbe your unbelief sin is
[1:13:36] unbelief
[1:13:37] you'll perish in your unbelief oh who
[1:13:40] now he goes into a song now
[1:13:42] that's that's uh that he he's gonna
[1:13:44] bring right in here with
[1:13:46] what he believes he says oh who do you
[1:13:49] say that i
[1:13:50] am from whence did you say that i came
[1:13:53] oh do you know my father or can you tell
[1:13:56] his name
[1:13:57] i am the roses sharon the bride and the
[1:14:00] morning star
[1:14:02] can you tell me who he is i am that
[1:14:04] spoke to moses in the burning bush of
[1:14:06] fire
[1:14:07] i am the god of abraham the bride and
[1:14:09] morning star
[1:14:10] i am the rose of sharon oh whence did
[1:14:13] you say
[1:14:14] that i came oh do you know my father or
[1:14:16] can you tell his name
[1:14:18] amen i am alpha and omega the beginning
[1:14:21] in the end
[1:14:22] i am the whole creation and jesus
[1:14:26] is his name hallelujah
[1:14:29] amen now so of course we we have spoke
[1:14:33] about
[1:14:34] being in a day that we are living in
[1:14:37] with this
[1:14:37] is as it was in the days of sodom so
[1:14:40] shall it be in the days of the coming
[1:14:43] or the revealing of the son of man so
[1:14:45] again
[1:14:46] what were those those were lights from
[1:14:49] heaven
[1:14:49] as as angels would come down and take on
[1:14:53] flesh
[1:14:54] god himself would wrap himself in a
[1:14:57] as the pillar of fire would hover over
[1:15:00] 17
[1:15:00] elements or whatever they are that makes
[1:15:02] up a human body
[1:15:03] don't make to me no no difference to me
[1:15:06] how many they are
[1:15:07] i'm not a scientist we're just we're
[1:15:08] just actually
[1:15:10] referring to some things that brother
[1:15:11] branham said about that but they were
[1:15:13] lights from heaven they come down and
[1:15:15] here he takes an
[1:15:16] on a body he wraps himself in flesh and
[1:15:19] comes down
[1:15:20] in an investigating judgment
[1:15:24] now remember we've been through it he is
[1:15:26] looking for faith
[1:15:28] because when the son of man cometh will
[1:15:30] he find faith
[1:15:32] he's got to have somebody that will
[1:15:34] believe
[1:15:37] and he'll do whatever it takes to turn
[1:15:40] your heart from unbelief
[1:15:41] to faith because this is a god who is
[1:15:45] determined
[1:15:46] to fulfill his word i mean he's with me
[1:15:49] now
[1:15:50] and the other things he's looking for
[1:15:51] those he will seal those who
[1:15:53] sigh and cry for the abominations that's
[1:15:56] done in the city that sin makes them
[1:15:58] sick
[1:15:59] which is an evidence of the holy ghost
[1:16:02] in a person's life
[1:16:04] is that right yes sir now let me just
[1:16:06] assure you
[1:16:08] that same angel that was there that
[1:16:10] stayed with abraham discerned the hearts
[1:16:13] of sarah in the tent
[1:16:14] and began to tell him of the secrets
[1:16:18] of what was going to happen down in
[1:16:19] sodom and the
[1:16:21] the end time events and the promise of
[1:16:23] the coming son
[1:16:25] and all these other things that are in
[1:16:26] type notice that
[1:16:28] that same angel there will be
[1:16:31] is the one who is representing himself
[1:16:34] today
[1:16:35] christ himself vindicating himself
[1:16:38] in a message in this last day amen again
[1:16:42] to return our hearts back to the
[1:16:44] faith the original doctrine
[1:16:47] that was once delivered to the saints
[1:16:49] now the truth
[1:16:50] it will return us back to miracles signs
[1:16:53] wonders healings deliverance gifts
[1:16:55] everything that's in the bible but but
[1:16:58] in particular
[1:16:59] it's going to turn us back to the
[1:17:01] original
[1:17:02] teaching that paul preached the original
[1:17:06] gospel
[1:17:07] are you with me now now let me just
[1:17:10] assure you
[1:17:11] today that angel is not dead
[1:17:15] amen angels can't die amen they're
[1:17:18] immortal beings
[1:17:19] they're free from death they cannot die
[1:17:22] amen now
[1:17:23] so you you see uh and brother branham
[1:17:26] would say these words he says
[1:17:28] now do you believe angels can't die they
[1:17:31] can't die
[1:17:32] their immortal beings are free from
[1:17:33] death they cannot die
[1:17:35] then when that angels that stood with
[1:17:37] paul is still
[1:17:39] in existence today
[1:17:44] of this the one that was in the burning
[1:17:46] bush
[1:17:47] is still in existence today
[1:17:53] and we're even going to show you that
[1:17:54] the pillar of fire
[1:17:56] amen the one that was in that pillar of
[1:17:58] fire
[1:17:59] was there in jesus name
[1:18:02] when he walked the shores of galilee
[1:18:06] amen now he would come on and take on
[1:18:09] the name
[1:18:10] jesus which would combine
[1:18:13] every previous name of god
[1:18:16] before him it would all be incorporated
[1:18:20] or encapsulated
[1:18:21] in that one name because there would be
[1:18:24] no salvation in any other name
[1:18:28] his only name there's deliverance it's
[1:18:30] only named as healing there's only a
[1:18:32] name there's salvation
[1:18:33] is in that name jesus
[1:18:37] the angel said call his name jesus
[1:18:40] he was named actually by the angel
[1:18:44] heaven named him and that name means
[1:18:48] jehovah the savior for he will save
[1:18:51] his people from their sins
[1:18:55] now so again as he as
[1:18:58] brother branham would talk about this
[1:19:00] and we know the angel lord that
[1:19:02] accompanied his minister
[1:19:04] and that that there was a pillar of fire
[1:19:06] that would come
[1:19:07] service after service after service
[1:19:09] which was the angel lord
[1:19:11] in the in the form of a pillar of fire
[1:19:14] then he
[1:19:14] he said that's this the god that met
[1:19:17] paul
[1:19:18] on the road down to damascus and shown
[1:19:21] around him like a big light that same
[1:19:23] lord jesus
[1:19:24] is alive and risen tonight there was a
[1:19:28] light that is
[1:19:29] that shone around is that right of light
[1:19:31] perhaps
[1:19:32] maybe the same light that the children
[1:19:34] of israel followed through the
[1:19:36] wilderness a fire
[1:19:37] a light a pillar of fire that led them
[1:19:39] in the darkness
[1:19:40] i believe he's here tonight i believe
[1:19:42] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:19:44] forever
[1:19:45] now you can say you can believe that
[1:19:47] brother branham
[1:19:48] now watch this and he says that would be
[1:19:52] a theology now theology is also
[1:19:55] known as a theory so you can say well i
[1:19:59] believe that
[1:20:00] well that's only a theory that's only a
[1:20:03] theology
[1:20:04] that's that's a creed creed means i
[1:20:07] believe this is what i believe
[1:20:09] but he said if god confirms that to be
[1:20:12] the truth
[1:20:13] then it's no longer a theology it's the
[1:20:16] truth
[1:20:17] it becomes a reality
[1:20:21] now i want to get to it to you i mean
[1:20:23] anybody can say i saw a light
[1:20:26] i saw a pillar of fire i saw this it
[1:20:29] moved here it did that
[1:20:31] it stood over this and it did that it
[1:20:33] was here it's leading me
[1:20:34] hey you know it said this and that but
[1:20:36] when it discerned the thoughts and the
[1:20:38] intentions of heart
[1:20:40] when it tells the name and the address
[1:20:42] and where they come from
[1:20:43] when it never failed
[1:20:47] then you know it's got to be the
[1:20:48] original logos
[1:20:50] because the logos the word discerns the
[1:20:54] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:20:57] amen now this angel
[1:21:01] is the angel of the covenant it's none
[1:21:04] other than the lord jesus christ
[1:21:06] and we're we're talking about listen we
[1:21:08] are a book of acts church
[1:21:11] amen we we're we're the logos is
[1:21:14] speaking
[1:21:15] and manifests himself to people in this
[1:21:18] generation
[1:21:20] you are a people who have heard directly
[1:21:23] from the logos no that's not a theology
[1:21:29] am i not not something hatched out in
[1:21:31] the seminary
[1:21:32] not a message of of just a messenger
[1:21:36] but i want to get it it was a message
[1:21:39] from the
[1:21:40] god himself through the angel
[1:21:43] of the covenant this is no
[1:21:47] mere man's ideas it's no
[1:21:50] mere man's uh the doctrines are thinking
[1:21:54] it is the voice of almighty god
[1:21:57] to the last age and you've got to have
[1:22:00] an ear to hear it
[1:22:03] you must hear what the spirit is saying
[1:22:06] to the church
[1:22:07] because this is a day specifically what
[1:22:10] the spirit speaks
[1:22:13] and vindicates who is speaking
[1:22:18] and he wants you to know it's not the
[1:22:20] eyeballs
[1:22:21] or the i will be but it's the i am
[1:22:24] still speaking
[1:22:29] now you can tell if it's the same angel
[1:22:32] lord
[1:22:32] because you watch its nature it bears
[1:22:35] the same fruit
[1:22:36] it's here in the church bearing the same
[1:22:39] fruit
[1:22:40] making another pentecostal church
[1:22:44] this is what brother branham said now
[1:22:45] what's the angel lord
[1:22:47] what's what kind of nature it has it
[1:22:49] bears the same fruit that it did when it
[1:22:51] was here on the earth
[1:22:53] now it's back in the church it is
[1:22:55] bearing forth the same fruit
[1:22:57] making another pentecostal church just
[1:23:00] exactly the way
[1:23:02] it did the first time now i'm going to
[1:23:05] tell you
[1:23:06] if whatever you're following doesn't
[1:23:08] make another book of acts
[1:23:10] original pentecostal church exactly
[1:23:14] like the original church of pentecost
[1:23:17] it is not the angel of the lord because
[1:23:20] you can identify if it changes the lord
[1:23:23] by the fruit
[1:23:26] that it produces
[1:23:29] now again
[1:23:33] again let us just declare to you
[1:23:37] who is the messenger of this
[1:23:40] hour and we know we have earthly
[1:23:42] messengers
[1:23:44] we know when and we certainly believe
[1:23:46] that
[1:23:47] you know the seventh angel was william
[1:23:50] branham
[1:23:51] we believe that he had in accordance to
[1:23:53] the bible that in the days the voice of
[1:23:54] the seventh angel
[1:23:56] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:23:58] of god would be finished
[1:23:59] we believe that we're here in the
[1:24:00] seventh church age
[1:24:02] and that he would address that god jesus
[1:24:05] would address
[1:24:06] letters to men who are messengers so he
[1:24:10] would say to the angels
[1:24:12] angelos which is the same word with john
[1:24:14] the baptist says
[1:24:16] when he spoke of john the baptist as a
[1:24:18] messenger i'll sin before my face is
[1:24:20] angelos he was a messenger or an
[1:24:23] angel from god are you with me
[1:24:27] amen but he was earthly angel but i want
[1:24:30] you to understand
[1:24:31] though the earthly angel is no longer
[1:24:34] here
[1:24:36] the angel lord is still here and he's
[1:24:39] still in charge
[1:24:43] he has not left his church
[1:24:47] we would see jesus he would he said it
[1:24:50] this way
[1:24:51] and jesus said as it was and there's a
[1:24:53] lot so shall it be in the coming of the
[1:24:56] son of man
[1:24:57] there the church nominal has their
[1:24:59] messengers
[1:25:00] and the messenger of the holy spirit
[1:25:03] is with the church elected doing the
[1:25:06] same thing
[1:25:07] which makes him christ the same
[1:25:09] yesterday today and forever who
[1:25:12] is the messenger of this hour no man
[1:25:15] the holy ghost is the messenger
[1:25:18] of this hour what is it god dwelling
[1:25:22] in human flesh glory i feel religious
[1:25:25] god in human flesh dwelling among you
[1:25:28] jesus said lo a little while the world
[1:25:30] saith me more
[1:25:31] no more that's the unbeliever but you
[1:25:33] shall see me
[1:25:34] the church for i personal pronoun again
[1:25:36] i'll be with you
[1:25:38] even in you to the end of the age the
[1:25:40] end of the world
[1:25:41] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:25:44] and forever
[1:25:44] our god is not dead he's living forever
[1:25:47] more
[1:25:48] he's living at the end time when the sun
[1:25:50] is setting
[1:25:51] amen want to just bring it back to you
[1:25:55] we have not just heard from a mere man
[1:25:59] we have heard from the messenger
[1:26:03] of the covenant the holy ghost
[1:26:06] himself amen and that
[1:26:10] is the messenger of the hour
[1:26:16] so the angel is still here as brother
[1:26:19] branham
[1:26:19] say that same angel that led israel
[1:26:23] is here now performing and doing the
[1:26:26] same thing
[1:26:27] it did when it was in the person of
[1:26:28] jesus christ
[1:26:30] christ the body is ascended to the right
[1:26:32] hand of the father
[1:26:33] but the holy spirit has come back the
[1:26:35] life that was in christ is in the church
[1:26:39] john 14 uh john 15 i'm divine
[1:26:42] you are the branches of vine doesn't
[1:26:44] bear fruit
[1:26:45] it's the branch and you know you people
[1:26:47] here your great razors and so on
[1:26:49] if that first branch that came out of
[1:26:52] the vine produced
[1:26:53] a book of acts behind it that first
[1:26:55] church if that
[1:26:56] vine ever puts forth another another
[1:27:00] branch it'll write another book of acts
[1:27:02] behind it
[1:27:03] for the very light that's in the vine
[1:27:05] brings forth into the branch
[1:27:09] now now i want to come down to some
[1:27:13] things today as we
[1:27:15] as we speak because along
[1:27:18] with the miracles of jesus were the
[1:27:21] teachings of jesus and in abraham's day
[1:27:26] there was the miracle the change
[1:27:29] there was the miracle of the discernment
[1:27:33] there was a miracle of saving lot out of
[1:27:36] sodom
[1:27:37] there were miracles that were taking
[1:27:40] place
[1:27:40] are you with me and when the calling of
[1:27:43] sarah's name
[1:27:44] that had been given her by the angel
[1:27:47] but but i want you to notice it was not
[1:27:50] all
[1:27:51] miracles it was the revealing
[1:27:54] to abraham the hidden things notice now
[1:28:01] and then that day he didn't didn't
[1:28:05] and when we come to this day he didn't
[1:28:07] just
[1:28:08] discern the heart and
[1:28:11] and heal the sick and open the eyes of
[1:28:14] the blind and cripples walk
[1:28:16] come on but he but he then these things
[1:28:20] never failed and never missed
[1:28:24] but he is also here revealing himself
[1:28:28] to abraham's group the mysteries
[1:28:33] so you see jesus had miracles
[1:28:36] that proved he was from god come on
[1:28:39] but also what did he have he had a
[1:28:41] message
[1:28:43] the teachings of jesus moses had
[1:28:46] miracles with signs but he didn't just
[1:28:49] have miracles he had the teachings of
[1:28:51] moses
[1:28:52] we come right down to abraham abraham
[1:28:54] received
[1:28:55] they received miracles
[1:28:58] but then there was the teachings given
[1:29:00] to abraham from the angel
[1:29:04] i want you to get this this is revealed
[1:29:07] by the angel
[1:29:10] wasn't things that moses knew wasn't
[1:29:13] things
[1:29:14] abraham knew and i'll tell you in a
[1:29:16] minute it wasn't even things jesus knew
[1:29:19] it was the things that the logos knew
[1:29:28] now the logos the word the bible said in
[1:29:31] hebrews
[1:29:31] 4 12 for the word the logos
[1:29:36] of god is alive if it was live then his
[1:29:40] life now
[1:29:41] and it's powerful and it's sharper than
[1:29:44] any two-edged sword it pierces even to
[1:29:46] the dividing of soul and spirit
[1:29:48] and the joints in the moral and is the
[1:29:50] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:29:53] the heart
[1:29:54] now you see that's why brother branham
[1:29:57] would say
[1:29:58] and and and advise us you know because
[1:30:01] these things
[1:30:02] didn't just come from william branham
[1:30:06] and he would say to us don't you see
[1:30:08] friends don't let
[1:30:09] loose of that word you see
[1:30:12] it's a spirit that gets on you and i
[1:30:14] tell these women when they make
[1:30:16] themselves look sexy in these dresses
[1:30:18] that god's going to make you answer for
[1:30:20] committing adultery
[1:30:21] if you believe me to be what i s what
[1:30:24] what you say
[1:30:25] god's servant a prophet listen to what
[1:30:28] i'm telling you
[1:30:29] you might not be able to understand it
[1:30:31] and if you can't
[1:30:32] then just do what i tell you to do
[1:30:35] god will hold me responsible for what i
[1:30:37] said you listen real close
[1:30:39] and remember those things are spirit so
[1:30:42] a lot of things that
[1:30:43] he would address he wasn't just
[1:30:45] addressing
[1:30:47] uh the situation he was looking at the
[1:30:50] spirit behind it
[1:30:53] you can say well i don't understand why
[1:30:55] that was said
[1:30:56] well sometimes you don't understand
[1:30:59] because you're not seeing the motivating
[1:31:01] force
[1:31:03] that is causing that to happen amen
[1:31:06] now so he had said to abraham he said
[1:31:09] shall i
[1:31:09] hide from abraham what i'm going to do
[1:31:13] so you know here he discerns his heart
[1:31:16] and now he begins to reveal the
[1:31:17] mysteries
[1:31:18] he tells about the end time judgment the
[1:31:21] burning of sodom
[1:31:22] the salvation of those that are down in
[1:31:25] sodom
[1:31:26] all these mysteries the mystery of the
[1:31:29] coming sun the
[1:31:30] mystery of the body change the mystery
[1:31:32] if we can bring it down it's the mystery
[1:31:34] of the rapture
[1:31:37] amen it tells all of these things
[1:31:41] notice it doesn't go down to sodom it
[1:31:44] doesn't go to lox group
[1:31:47] it goes to abraham and history beholden
[1:31:53] but there's somebody going to believe it
[1:31:56] thank you lord now
[1:32:00] so he would say i'm not going to keep
[1:32:02] from abraham
[1:32:03] the secrets that i know because he's
[1:32:05] going to be the heir of the
[1:32:07] the world and he says we got to write
[1:32:10] this morning to know the secrets of the
[1:32:13] coming of the lord for blessed are the
[1:32:15] peacemakers they shall be called the
[1:32:16] children of god
[1:32:17] blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[1:32:19] they shall be filled blessed are the
[1:32:20] pure heart for they shall see god
[1:32:22] blessed are the meek
[1:32:23] for they shall inherit the earth
[1:32:29] then if the it's if the church of the
[1:32:31] living god has inherited the earth
[1:32:33] there is no secret to be kept from
[1:32:36] it so this is why
[1:32:40] that here we come down to the last age
[1:32:43] that god is bringing a time of
[1:32:46] restoration
[1:32:48] and it's going to be a restoration by
[1:32:50] the angel
[1:32:52] of the covenant himself
[1:32:56] now i want you to look back and think
[1:32:58] for a moment
[1:32:59] at israel's deliverance from down in
[1:33:01] egypt god spoke to moses in a burning
[1:33:04] bush of fire
[1:33:05] it was a pillar of fire it was the angel
[1:33:07] lord but who
[1:33:09] was that angel lord now whoever he was
[1:33:14] that's who he is today
[1:33:15] [Music]
[1:33:18] because that was only a prophecy
[1:33:20] speaking of the end time
[1:33:22] it's not just a story that's right not
[1:33:25] just a jewish history
[1:33:27] it's a prophecy amen
[1:33:30] now as brother branham would declare
[1:33:33] about it and you don't remember him
[1:33:34] saying this in 20th century prophet
[1:33:36] he said to my opinion it's the same
[1:33:39] angel of god that followed the children
[1:33:40] of israel from egypt to palestine
[1:33:43] you know as a scholar yourself that was
[1:33:45] the angel of covenant
[1:33:46] none other than our lord jesus christ
[1:33:51] now that same mighty
[1:33:54] cabinet angel has presented to you
[1:33:59] an open book it is the title
[1:34:03] to our inheritance if you're looking in
[1:34:06] revelation you know the book of
[1:34:07] revelation there's a book sealed with
[1:34:09] seven seals
[1:34:10] is that right but for you it's not a
[1:34:12] sealed book it's an open book
[1:34:15] amen because the mighty angel has
[1:34:18] presented to you
[1:34:20] an open book by removing the seals
[1:34:23] now he's the same one that founded the
[1:34:26] nation of the seed of abraham
[1:34:30] it was angel lord who would also call
[1:34:33] the church out in the first exodus and
[1:34:36] would appear in the burning boots of
[1:34:37] fire
[1:34:38] listen brother branham in the book of
[1:34:40] exodus he says the pillar of fire that
[1:34:42] led the children of israel
[1:34:43] through the day and night in the daytime
[1:34:45] it looked like a cloud
[1:34:47] at night time it looked like a pillar of
[1:34:49] fire leading to
[1:34:50] israel and that was the angel of the
[1:34:53] covenant
[1:34:54] none other than jesus christ himself
[1:34:56] before
[1:34:57] he was made flesh and come in the womb
[1:35:00] of mary
[1:35:01] it was christ moses followed
[1:35:05] christ christ said the scripture said he
[1:35:08] was in the wilderness with moses
[1:35:10] and that's who he was the angel of the
[1:35:12] covenant now
[1:35:14] again in redemption by power he says it
[1:35:17] this way god gave them a pillar of fire
[1:35:19] to go
[1:35:20] before them i think they had the picture
[1:35:22] here tonight i'd say it with reverence
[1:35:25] to my honest opinion while we're here in
[1:35:27] this group
[1:35:28] tonight i believe that is with us that
[1:35:32] that same pillar of fire that led to
[1:35:34] children of israel is going before us
[1:35:37] performing the same signs and wonders
[1:35:39] and any teacher
[1:35:40] or scholar of the bible knows that that
[1:35:43] angel followed israel and
[1:35:45] guided them to the promised land it was
[1:35:47] the angel of the covenant
[1:35:49] which was jesus christ and today
[1:35:53] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:35:55] and forever
[1:35:56] is following before this group that you
[1:35:59] want to call holy rollers
[1:36:00] if you want to all right going on
[1:36:03] leading them from victory
[1:36:05] on the victory now i want you to
[1:36:08] understand he's going to take this
[1:36:10] church where all the way into rapture
[1:36:13] he's not going to abandon the project
[1:36:16] he's not going to turn his back on us
[1:36:20] he's not going to leave us and abandon
[1:36:22] us he's going to be with us even in us
[1:36:24] to the end of the world
[1:36:26] this is his promise i will never leave
[1:36:30] you
[1:36:32] so the same pillar of fire is right here
[1:36:36] in the church as we gather today the
[1:36:39] same
[1:36:40] logos the same word of god the same one
[1:36:43] who created the world
[1:36:45] no wonder then he can create new eyes no
[1:36:48] wonder
[1:36:48] he can create new hair no wonder he can
[1:36:51] heal cancer
[1:36:52] no wonder he can do this because he's
[1:36:55] the creator himself
[1:37:01] now let's give you some scripture i want
[1:37:03] you to go to first corinthians 10
[1:37:05] 4. that rock in the wilderness
[1:37:09] let's see who he was and they all did
[1:37:12] drink the same spiritual drink
[1:37:14] for the drink of that spiritual rock
[1:37:16] that followed them
[1:37:17] and that rock was christ
[1:37:23] so here he goes to show you that the one
[1:37:25] they followed
[1:37:27] was christ
[1:37:30] now go go with me to hebrews chapter 11
[1:37:33] 26 moses esteemed the reproach of
[1:37:38] christ greater riches than the treasures
[1:37:42] of
[1:37:42] in egypt perhaps respected to the
[1:37:45] recompense of reward
[1:37:46] so it was the reproach of christ that he
[1:37:50] esteemed greater than the treasures of
[1:37:53] egypt in first peter 1 11
[1:37:56] search and water what minor of time the
[1:37:59] spirit of christ
[1:38:00] which was in them did signify
[1:38:03] so it was the spirit of christ leading
[1:38:06] them
[1:38:07] in the wilderness when it testified
[1:38:09] before time uh beforehand the sufferings
[1:38:12] of christ
[1:38:12] and the glory that should follow so
[1:38:16] again this would be david under the song
[1:38:19] my god my god why has i forsaken me
[1:38:23] my bones they spared me only it was the
[1:38:25] spirit of christ in
[1:38:27] david is that right
[1:38:30] now that it's showing us that he's the
[1:38:33] same
[1:38:34] jesus now
[1:38:38] not the jesus of the seminaries not
[1:38:44] a denominational jesus
[1:38:47] but the jesus you you see
[1:38:50] that jesus of denomination and
[1:38:52] seminaries is
[1:38:54] a jesus that is handcrafted
[1:38:58] molded and formed by
[1:39:01] went to whatever image they want to make
[1:39:04] them
[1:39:06] amen someone to make him the second
[1:39:08] person of a trinity
[1:39:11] someone to take and make him mind his
[1:39:12] mama you better pray to her first
[1:39:16] come on because he gotta mind his mama
[1:39:18] he can't turn his mama's heart down
[1:39:21] whatever mama says that's the catholic
[1:39:23] church that's right
[1:39:24] right amen denominations want
[1:39:27] to hand craft him and change him and
[1:39:30] mold him into whatever they want
[1:39:33] they want a jesus that you know is all
[1:39:36] accepting of
[1:39:37] all kinds of sin now listen he's
[1:39:40] accepted
[1:39:40] of all kinds of sinners but not all
[1:39:44] kinds of sin
[1:39:45] [Applause]
[1:39:48] are you with me amen he will accept
[1:39:51] anyone who wants to come and repent
[1:39:53] you're a homosexual a lesbian
[1:39:56] if you're a murderer rapist or whatever
[1:39:58] you can come to him and find
[1:40:00] mercy but he won't leave you in your
[1:40:03] sins
[1:40:04] he will save you from your sins
[1:40:09] amen now you see
[1:40:12] again he is not the jesus
[1:40:15] of the seminaries he is not
[1:40:18] the jesus of denominations this that
[1:40:22] jesus is found
[1:40:23] in in thessalonians where he sits in the
[1:40:26] temple of god
[1:40:27] showing himself that he is god and when
[1:40:29] the mask is taken off of him he's not
[1:40:32] really jesus
[1:40:33] at all it's the devil it's the man of
[1:40:35] sin
[1:40:39] now you see
[1:40:42] this was the same covenant angel
[1:40:47] that led joshua into the promised land
[1:40:51] and it's the same covenant angel that's
[1:40:54] leading us
[1:40:55] into the full promise of the word just
[1:40:58] like joshua was prophesying
[1:41:02] by what he was doing you see they didn't
[1:41:04] realize it
[1:41:05] but their lives were prophesied
[1:41:09] they were foretelling that there was
[1:41:11] going to be
[1:41:12] things that would happen in the end time
[1:41:14] where a people would be brought in
[1:41:17] to a land of promise even as
[1:41:20] israel was restored a man but as a
[1:41:23] nation back to their
[1:41:25] back to their homeland even so god's
[1:41:27] doing the same thing with a
[1:41:29] spiritual people a spiritual israelis
[1:41:31] they
[1:41:32] restore them back to their homeland
[1:41:35] and that homeland is the bible
[1:41:38] amen we we we can't find a home in
[1:41:41] baptist methodist presbyterian catholic
[1:41:43] but we can find a homeland right here in
[1:41:45] this bible
[1:41:47] right here in this word of god
[1:41:48] [Applause]
[1:41:52] now so you see it's that covenant angel
[1:41:55] leading us into the full promise
[1:41:58] of the word as he led joshua into the
[1:42:00] promised land
[1:42:01] and you remember you remember that day
[1:42:04] as they were as he was looking
[1:42:06] at the walls now remember there were
[1:42:09] seals
[1:42:09] there were sealed walls that had to be
[1:42:13] opened in order to come into the
[1:42:15] promised land
[1:42:17] jericho will have to be the first
[1:42:20] conquest
[1:42:21] if we don't get the sealed walls down
[1:42:25] come on amen then we can't
[1:42:28] have the rest of the land but when you
[1:42:31] get jericho
[1:42:32] open then all the rest of the land is
[1:42:34] open
[1:42:36] amen so we start right here seven seals
[1:42:39] has got to be revealed
[1:42:40] amen until the book is open and the
[1:42:43] seals are taken off
[1:42:45] then we can inherit all the land but if
[1:42:48] we get the seals open
[1:42:51] then the rest of the land is out
[1:42:54] every promise that lays in the book is
[1:42:56] ours healing is ours deliverance is our
[1:42:59] salvation is ours
[1:43:00] the rapture is our everything that lays
[1:43:03] in the promised land
[1:43:06] but first the seals have to be broken
[1:43:11] hallelujah remember they went around
[1:43:14] there seven times in silence
[1:43:17] and nobody knew the mystery nobody
[1:43:19] understood
[1:43:21] but when they come to the seventh time
[1:43:23] there was a memorial again
[1:43:26] of the seven times that they went as we
[1:43:28] and we went back and we said do we come
[1:43:30] through one church age
[1:43:31] second church age three or third church
[1:43:33] age four churches
[1:43:35] fifth churches six churches seventh
[1:43:37] church age
[1:43:38] amen because the last day you march
[1:43:40] around it seven times
[1:43:42] amen and it all becomes revealed and we
[1:43:45] hear
[1:43:46] it we are reminded of our journey
[1:43:49] amen but once that we complete that it's
[1:43:52] time now
[1:43:53] for the shout out for the silence to be
[1:43:57] broken
[1:43:58] do you understand we're in the day where
[1:44:01] god himself
[1:44:02] breaks the silence word that has been
[1:44:05] held back
[1:44:06] mysteries that have been held back to
[1:44:08] the end times and
[1:44:09] god breaks the silence
[1:44:12] with a shout out
[1:44:16] amen when he shouts the walls come down
[1:44:22] hallelujah are you with me now so this
[1:44:26] joshua seen this man as he goes to
[1:44:29] conqueror
[1:44:30] he needs a battle plan he needs to know
[1:44:32] how do i get in this
[1:44:35] and so joshua's seen this man it was the
[1:44:38] captain in other words
[1:44:39] the leader of the host of israel
[1:44:43] you know in joshua 5
[1:44:47] 13 the bible said joshua looked
[1:44:50] and there stood a man with a sword drawn
[1:44:53] in his hand
[1:44:54] and joshua went to him and said our thou
[1:44:57] forests
[1:44:58] are for our adversaries and he says nay
[1:45:02] basically he says i'm not on your side
[1:45:06] you're on my side amen amen
[1:45:10] because as captain of the host of the
[1:45:12] lord
[1:45:13] i am now i'm sure you got this all wrong
[1:45:18] you think i you know i'm going to help

[1:45:38] i'm not hanging back in the background i

[1:45:42] right here going before you
[1:45:45] amen amen as captain of the army of the
[1:45:49] lord
[1:45:50] am i come i am taking charge
[1:45:54] and i'm leading the way hallelujah
[1:45:58] i'm preaching to a people today that are
[1:46:00] lit by a pillar of fire
[1:46:02] and man he goes before you and man
[1:46:06] you can look at any enemy you can look
[1:46:08] at any situation
[1:46:09] and you know your god is already wet
[1:46:12] before you
[1:46:13] be comforted he'll comfort for you today
[1:46:21] amen that leader brother brandon said
[1:46:24] was
[1:46:24] none other than christ himself what was
[1:46:27] he seeing in a pillar of fire
[1:46:29] and now that pillar of fire had become a
[1:46:32] man
[1:46:32] hope you know what i'm talking about he
[1:46:34] become a man joshua alone by himself
[1:46:36] seen just what it was
[1:46:38] that that pillar of fire that led them
[1:46:40] as an angel
[1:46:41] here he stood and he called himself the
[1:46:44] captain of the host
[1:46:45] he was the unseen one and he's still
[1:46:48] the captain of the host of the lord the
[1:46:51] unseen one the invisible one the
[1:46:53] omnipotent one
[1:46:55] and he stands tonight just as really was
[1:46:57] standing there
[1:46:58] against the walls of jericho the same
[1:47:01] lord jesus
[1:47:03] that made abraham many many hundred
[1:47:06] years before there
[1:47:07] had no father no mother no beginning of
[1:47:10] days or end of years
[1:47:11] melchizedek the eternal one
[1:47:20] now let me remind you
[1:47:23] this pillar of fire this jesus
[1:47:27] this holy spirit of the bible
[1:47:30] is not giving us a theory or a theology
[1:47:35] but a word by divine vindication
[1:47:40] now in in the book of revelation
[1:47:45] it begins with you know blessed is he
[1:47:48] that readeth and they say here's the
[1:47:49] word of this prophecy
[1:47:51] keep those things that are written for
[1:47:52] the time is at hand
[1:47:54] we're here this is where
[1:47:57] the time is at hand when
[1:48:00] when when the revelation of jesus christ
[1:48:04] has been revealed to the body of christ
[1:48:07] and christ has been revealed as not dead
[1:48:10] but alive
[1:48:12] a man living in his church doing the
[1:48:14] same things he did the same
[1:48:16] ministry the same gospel the same sign
[1:48:19] the same
[1:48:20] resurrected christ when he's revealed by
[1:48:22] his angel in church
[1:48:23] then the time is at hand
[1:48:27] so we are here in the hour where the
[1:48:29] time
[1:48:30] is at hand never been a time until
[1:48:34] that day until this has the mystery of
[1:48:37] jesus christ
[1:48:38] been revealed until these last few years
[1:48:43] that's why we know the time is at hand
[1:48:46] now it has to compare
[1:48:50] with the rest of the scripture
[1:48:53] but it does not have to compare
[1:48:57] with men's interpretation of the rest of
[1:49:00] the scripture
[1:49:05] it has to be biblical
[1:49:08] but it does not have to fit men's
[1:49:10] interpretations
[1:49:12] of the bible
[1:49:16] now let's talk about this in the old
[1:49:19] testament
[1:49:20] they had the breastplate of aaron they
[1:49:22] called it
[1:49:23] the human thurman and when one would
[1:49:26] prophesy and tell his dream
[1:49:28] it would have to be told before this
[1:49:30] year of thurman
[1:49:32] if it was true that god would answer
[1:49:36] by the pillar of fire and it would shine
[1:49:39] through those 12 stones of israel on the
[1:49:42] breastplate of aaron
[1:49:43] the the the the urim and thurman
[1:49:47] and so then every he would manifest
[1:49:50] himself through lights
[1:49:52] to prove whether whatever the prophesier
[1:49:56] was saying
[1:49:57] was of god or not it had to be
[1:49:59] vindicated
[1:50:00] by a pillar of fire amen now we got a
[1:50:03] lot of people
[1:50:04] with a lot of claims
[1:50:07] but i want to know does the light shine
[1:50:11] is there pillow fire to vindicate it
[1:50:14] from genesis to revelation
[1:50:18] come on you know people can say a lot of
[1:50:20] things
[1:50:21] they can have a lot of opinions and they
[1:50:24] can say
[1:50:25] this and this and this national and and
[1:50:27] and have their discourses and
[1:50:29] their theologies and what they believe
[1:50:31] but does the pillar of fire
[1:50:33] vindicate it so what we're looking for
[1:50:38] for it to be the truth is for the
[1:50:40] prophet's prophecy
[1:50:42] to flash by the light
[1:50:45] [Applause]
[1:50:48] now you say well i'm a teacher and i
[1:50:50] believe something different
[1:50:52] we we we've got our ideas and we we've
[1:50:55] got
[1:50:55] well death where is the light
[1:51:01] that vindicates you're from god
[1:51:08] all right now when a prophet prophesies
[1:51:12] or a preacher preaches or an evangelist
[1:51:13] preaches
[1:51:14] or the dream said or whatever it is if
[1:51:17] it isn't according to word it's
[1:51:18] wrong and he says this is
[1:51:22] now god's your concern
[1:51:25] is that right if he doesn't declare
[1:51:29] if he doesn't um and if that angel who
[1:51:33] has declared himself and has proven if
[1:51:34] he doesn't
[1:51:35] in the human flesh declare himself to be
[1:51:37] the same nature
[1:51:39] with the same spirit working the same
[1:51:41] signs
[1:51:42] that he did when he was on the earth
[1:51:44] then it's the wrong angel
[1:51:47] so what were we looking for one that
[1:51:48] could discern the thoughts and intents
[1:51:50] of heart
[1:51:51] whose prophecies never fail
[1:51:54] come on amen and and what is it
[1:51:58] it would have to be have the same nature
[1:52:01] to be the same angel and it's not it's
[1:52:04] the wrong angel
[1:52:05] and if he declares himself to be the
[1:52:07] same it's christ and the church
[1:52:09] manifests himself in these last days he
[1:52:11] says that's as clear as i know the word
[1:52:14] now i wanted to say to you this was not
[1:52:17] an angel that came in a secret closet
[1:52:20] that nobody else saw
[1:52:24] because even those who didn't see it
[1:52:26] they were witnesses
[1:52:29] there were those who saw the pillar of
[1:52:30] fire there were souls who saw
[1:52:33] even the the physical form of the angel
[1:52:36] of the lord that
[1:52:36] stepped out of that pillar of fire and
[1:52:39] my but
[1:52:40] you know again even those who didn't see
[1:52:43] it
[1:52:44] like myself you know i didn't see it
[1:52:48] but i saw the effects
[1:52:51] of his presence i don't see the wind but
[1:52:55] i know if the wind is blowing
[1:52:58] i can feel the effects i can see the
[1:53:01] effects
[1:53:02] [Applause]
[1:53:05] hey man when he calls out a lady that i
[1:53:08] went to church with and as a young kid
[1:53:11] you know how children do six seven years
[1:53:13] old you know i'd get tired and
[1:53:15] i'd lay down on her lap sometime and go
[1:53:17] to sleep
[1:53:19] in the church her name and and
[1:53:22] she her name was sister boyd and he
[1:53:25] would
[1:53:26] call her out by name and
[1:53:29] tell her you got bursitis in your arm
[1:53:34] listen let me tell you something friends
[1:53:37] i knew
[1:53:39] i knew he didn't know that woman
[1:53:43] she testified he didn't know her
[1:53:46] she was my friend a close friend of my
[1:53:49] family
[1:53:50] and him to be called her by name and
[1:53:53] tell
[1:53:54] her her situation
[1:53:57] i didn't see the angel but i saw the
[1:54:00] events
[1:54:06] now i knew the angel was there now
[1:54:09] this is no mormon angel who delivers
[1:54:12] gold plates with
[1:54:14] coded unbiblical teachings this is the
[1:54:16] angel lord
[1:54:17] and he's the same one who taught paul
[1:54:21] by revelation now
[1:54:24] the true revelation is always brought
[1:54:28] by an angel amen
[1:54:31] i want that to sink in true
[1:54:35] has to be brought by an angel
[1:54:39] abraham received the revelation of one
[1:54:41] god
[1:54:42] did you know that he was a he was a his
[1:54:46] father was an idol maker an idol
[1:54:47] worshiper
[1:54:48] but the angel taught him about the
[1:54:51] founding of a new and godly race to
[1:54:53] which the messiah would come
[1:54:55] for through him all nations would be the
[1:54:57] world would be blessed
[1:54:58] and he catches a revelation god is one
[1:55:02] god
[1:55:03] and it leads him out of his heathen home
[1:55:06] and takes him down
[1:55:07] into a into a new place into a new land
[1:55:12] he had to get where the messiah was
[1:55:14] going to come
[1:55:16] now the angel of the covenant would
[1:55:18] appear to moses
[1:55:20] with a message of deliverance but also
[1:55:24] he instituted or should i say
[1:55:26] reinstituted
[1:55:27] the blood sacrifice said
[1:55:30] you gave them a token of the blood come
[1:55:34] on
[1:55:35] and then on mount sinai the angel of the
[1:55:37] covenant
[1:55:38] in a pillar of fire came down on the
[1:55:41] mountain
[1:55:42] and delivered the word of god in the
[1:55:45] form of the
[1:55:46] law now where do you think we got
[1:55:49] genesis from
[1:55:53] hello somebody what do you think you got
[1:55:57] the the the first five books of the
[1:56:00] bible
[1:56:02] where do you think you got it you think
[1:56:04] that was just the mind of moses
[1:56:09] now moses was a skilled man sure he was
[1:56:12] trained up with the egyptians but moses
[1:56:15] would write the first five books of the
[1:56:17] bible
[1:56:19] and where do you think it came down from
[1:56:21] where do you think
[1:56:22] he got that from amen where do you think
[1:56:25] the account of the creation came from
[1:56:28] and my genesis is called the first book
[1:56:31] of moses
[1:56:34] and he would write down what
[1:56:37] he saw
[1:56:41] by vision from that pillar of fire
[1:56:45] i want to say to you your bible came
[1:56:48] from the pillar of fire it did not come
[1:56:52] from a seminary
[1:56:54] it did not come from a denomination it
[1:56:56] came
[1:56:57] from the pillar of fire the logos the
[1:57:00] world
[1:57:03] amen now
[1:57:06] moses by revelation would bring us the
[1:57:09] view
[1:57:10] of the creation now that's an angel's
[1:57:13] view
[1:57:14] that's right that was brought to him by
[1:57:15] vision
[1:57:17] he would say in the beginning god
[1:57:20] created the heavens and the earth
[1:57:25] that counters all the smart men of the
[1:57:27] world today
[1:57:29] that claim to be smart
[1:57:33] moses by revelation would bring
[1:57:36] bring the angel's view of of the
[1:57:40] creation
[1:57:41] in fact of the matter is the book of
[1:57:44] acts declares
[1:57:45] in acts 7 53 we receive the law by the
[1:57:48] dispensation
[1:57:50] of or disposition of angels
[1:57:54] or the administration of angels
[1:57:57] in galatians 3 19 he says it was
[1:57:59] ordained
[1:58:00] by angels in the hand of a mediator
[1:58:05] that is the law was given by angels
[1:58:08] through
[1:58:08] moses who stood between god and man
[1:58:12] and in hebrews chapter 2 and verse 1
[1:58:16] it says we ought to give more earnest
[1:58:19] heed to the things that we have heard
[1:58:22] that's what i'm trying to do for you
[1:58:24] today give more earnest key
[1:58:28] listen this is not just a man's message
[1:58:31] this is god's message
[1:58:35] this is not just man's ideas it's god's
[1:58:37] word
[1:58:39] are you with me amen we ought to give
[1:58:41] more earnest heed to the things we have
[1:58:43] heard
[1:58:44] lest any time we should let them slip
[1:58:47] that means to leak out like a leaking
[1:58:50] vessel you know just lose it a little
[1:58:52] bit at a time
[1:58:54] for if the words spoken by angels were
[1:58:56] steadfast
[1:58:58] and the other transgression and
[1:58:59] disobedience received a just recompense
[1:59:02] of rewards you see
[1:59:03] you see that's what the law was the word
[1:59:06] spoken
[1:59:07] by angels the messenger of the covenant
[1:59:11] how shall we escape if we neglect so
[1:59:14] great of salvation
[1:59:15] which at first began to be spoken by the
[1:59:17] lord and was confirmed unto us by them
[1:59:20] that heard it god also bearing them
[1:59:22] witness
[1:59:22] but with signs and wonders and divers
[1:59:24] miracles and gifts of the holy spirit
[1:59:26] according to his will he said how are
[1:59:28] you going to escape if they didn't
[1:59:30] escape
[1:59:32] if they perished because they didn't
[1:59:34] believe their prophet
[1:59:38] what are you going to do when the
[1:59:41] if the word spoken by angels was
[1:59:43] steadfast what about it when we have
[1:59:45] received from the lord himself
[1:59:50] amos 3 and 7 it tells us surely
[1:59:54] god the lord god will do nothing
[1:59:58] but he revealeth his secrets unto his
[2:00:01] servants
[2:00:02] the prophets so he's very clear
[2:00:05] how his secret is going to come it will
[2:00:08] have to come from a prophet
[2:00:11] now but some will protest but
[2:00:14] brother tim that's not the that's not
[2:00:16] the way god
[2:00:17] reveals his word today for god has now
[2:00:20] spoke through his son
[2:00:21] well i'm glad you brought that up let's
[2:00:22] go to hebrews 1 and 1. let's read this
[2:00:26] god who had sundried times and divers
[2:00:29] manners
[2:00:29] spake in the times past unto the fathers
[2:00:32] by the prophets
[2:00:34] so he the hebrew writer would say you
[2:00:36] know this is the way god spoke
[2:00:38] in times past but he hath in these last
[2:00:42] days
[2:00:43] because he's walked now three and a half
[2:00:44] years on the earth
[2:00:46] spoken unto us by his son whom he has
[2:00:49] appointed
[2:00:50] heir of all things by whom he has also
[2:00:53] made the worlds
[2:00:54] who be in the brightness of his glory
[2:00:56] and express the image of his person
[2:00:58] and upholding all things by the word of
[2:01:00] his power when he had by himself purged
[2:01:03] our sins
[2:01:04] he sat down on the right hand of the
[2:01:06] majesty on high
[2:01:08] so and and i i want to just say now then
[2:01:13] but who was the son
[2:01:16] if it were not the father the creator
[2:01:20] of the fleshly body of jesus
[2:01:23] the logos made flesh
[2:01:28] are you with me now you see he has
[2:01:31] he had spoke to us by his son because
[2:01:35] god did not come visible in jesus christ
[2:01:38] but i want you to understand that god is
[2:01:41] still speaking
[2:01:42] through christ
[2:01:46] but no longer through the fleshly body
[2:01:49] of christ
[2:01:51] jesus he sits there on the air on the
[2:01:54] throne
[2:01:55] but his spirit is still here in the
[2:01:58] church
[2:02:01] now so who was the son if it were not
[2:02:04] the father the creator
[2:02:06] of that fleshly body the lugos
[2:02:10] made flesh now of course we know
[2:02:14] jesus couldn't be his own father he
[2:02:16] could not
[2:02:17] he could not the body could not create
[2:02:19] itself the spirit created that body
[2:02:22] amen
[2:02:25] but it don't ever say anywhere that the
[2:02:27] father couldn't be his own son
[2:02:31] because this is what god did he made a
[2:02:34] body
[2:02:35] and came and dwelt in it
[2:02:38] and he wasn't a different person he was
[2:02:40] the same person
[2:02:42] but now dwelling in the human body
[2:02:45] now again in the laodicean church age
[2:02:48] now to show that he's the first he's
[2:02:50] also the beginning of the creation of
[2:02:53] god
[2:02:53] let's just very let's go to our
[2:02:55] revelation of the godhead
[2:02:57] in revelation 3 14. this is for our age
[2:03:00] to the angel of the church of the
[2:03:01] laodiceans right these things saith the
[2:03:04] amen
[2:03:06] the faithful and true witness the
[2:03:07] beginning of the creation
[2:03:10] of god now that
[2:03:13] is the revelation that we are to stand
[2:03:17] upon
[2:03:19] in this last age it's a revelation of
[2:03:21] deity to the lay of the sin to the angel
[2:03:24] messenger of laodicean's right i want
[2:03:27] you to know this
[2:03:28] these things saith the amen the faithful
[2:03:31] and true witness
[2:03:33] the beginning of the creation of god now
[2:03:35] first of all
[2:03:36] god was going to put an amen
[2:03:39] to everything he said
[2:03:43] when come on when brother branham would
[2:03:44] stand there after preaching he said now
[2:03:46] if i told the truth
[2:03:48] let him vindicate it what was god doing
[2:03:51] give him an amen
[2:03:53] it is my word is that right
[2:03:57] and then these things sayeth the amen
[2:03:59] he's a faithful and true witness
[2:04:01] it never misses somebody help me preach
[2:04:06] the beginning of the creation of god
[2:04:10] now let's look at let's look at this
[2:04:12] he's standing in the midst of church
[2:04:14] he's revealing who he is in the last age
[2:04:17] he calls himself
[2:04:18] the author of the creation of god this
[2:04:21] is another creation
[2:04:23] this has to do with the church it's a
[2:04:24] special designation of himself
[2:04:27] he is the creator of the church the
[2:04:29] heavenly bridegroom
[2:04:30] created his own bride as the spirit of
[2:04:34] god he came down and created
[2:04:36] in the virgin mary the womb the cells
[2:04:39] from which his body was born
[2:04:41] in the womb of the virgin mary the cells
[2:04:43] from which his
[2:04:44] body had been was born i want to repeat
[2:04:46] that he created the very cells in the
[2:04:49] womb of mary for that body
[2:04:50] it was not enough for the holy spirit to
[2:04:52] simply give life to humanovin
[2:04:55] supplied by mary that would have been
[2:04:57] sinful mankind producing a body
[2:04:59] that would not have produced the last
[2:05:01] adam
[2:05:03] of him it was said lo a body has thou
[2:05:06] father prepared for me god not mary
[2:05:10] provided that body mary was the human
[2:05:14] incubator amen she carried that holy
[2:05:17] child and brought him to birth
[2:05:18] it was a god man he was the son of god
[2:05:22] he was of the new creation and
[2:05:25] man and god met and joined he was the
[2:05:28] first
[2:05:29] of this new race he is the head
[2:05:32] of this new race colossians 1
[2:05:36] 18 he is the head of the body the church
[2:05:39] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[2:05:42] the dead
[2:05:43] that in all things he might have
[2:05:45] preeminence
[2:05:46] first corinthians 15 21 for for since by
[2:05:50] man king death by man came also the
[2:05:53] resurrection of the dead
[2:05:55] for as in adam all die so in christ
[2:05:59] shall all men be made alive is that
[2:06:02] right
[2:06:02] so he's the first one from the dead amen
[2:06:06] amen because of all adam died
[2:06:10] come on but but and all who is in adam
[2:06:13] died but
[2:06:14] all that are in christ shall be made
[2:06:16] alive he's the firstborn
[2:06:20] from the dead he is the head of a new
[2:06:22] race
[2:06:23] he is the new creation
[2:06:28] what did god do he took cursed earth
[2:06:32] that had been formed now around that
[2:06:35] light that he placed
[2:06:36] in mary and there she ate and took up
[2:06:40] the elements of the earth and
[2:06:42] a body was built and that body there was
[2:06:45] brought
[2:06:45] right down to the river jordan and there
[2:06:49] is the river jordan somebody with me now
[2:06:52] here at the river jordan god and man
[2:06:55] met together again we had been
[2:06:58] alienated from god since adam but
[2:07:02] now god and man became reconciled
[2:07:05] in jesus christ amen and the only way
[2:07:09] you can be reconciled back to god
[2:07:11] is to be born of jesus christ of
[2:07:14] that same race hallelujah
[2:07:19] amen now ii corinthians 5 17 therefore
[2:07:23] if any man be in christ
[2:07:25] he is a new creation all things have
[2:07:27] passed away behold all things have
[2:07:29] become new
[2:07:30] that you can see that man was of the old
[2:07:33] order
[2:07:34] of creation but now united with christ
[2:07:37] he becomes a new creation of god
[2:07:41] ephesians 2 10 for we are of his
[2:07:43] workmanship
[2:07:44] created in christ jesus under good works
[2:07:48] ephesians 4 24 that you put on the new
[2:07:51] man
[2:07:52] which after clock god is created
[2:07:55] in righteousness and true holiness
[2:07:59] you see a christian is is not an old man
[2:08:02] made over again
[2:08:04] come on he's not a reformed sinner
[2:08:08] he is a new creation he is a brand new
[2:08:11] species
[2:08:12] he is a species that the devil has no
[2:08:15] control over
[2:08:17] that we can see the thing that that
[2:08:19] satan has come
[2:08:20] and he has no part in me because i'm not
[2:08:23] a part of the old creation
[2:08:25] i'm a part of the new creation i am a
[2:08:28] new species
[2:08:29] in christ jesus hallelujah
[2:08:33] that's who jesus was the devil had no
[2:08:35] claim on him
[2:08:38] and when god filled you with the holy
[2:08:40] ghost he claims this soil you lived in
[2:08:44] hallelujah he claims it for the
[2:08:47] resurrection
[2:08:48] to be changed also in a moment in the
[2:08:51] twinkling of an
[2:08:52] eye
[2:08:54] [Music]
[2:08:55] now so he is the author of this new
[2:08:58] creation
[2:09:00] notice how could god be created
[2:09:03] if he's a spirit so you see it's not
[2:09:06] jesus is the creation of god in the
[2:09:08] sense that god created
[2:09:10] god but god created a body
[2:09:14] therefore the father had a son
[2:09:18] the eternal spirit had an offspring
[2:09:22] that he made in the womb of a woman and
[2:09:25] then
[2:09:25] he comes and dwells in it
[2:09:29] amen not not two gods not two lords
[2:09:34] not a not a major god and a minor god
[2:09:37] not one that's god and the other isn't
[2:09:39] god it's all god
[2:09:42] amen but he was the beginning of that
[2:09:44] new creation
[2:09:45] it was which is jesus christ was made
[2:09:48] manifest
[2:09:49] god lived in he is god's creation
[2:09:53] my the first and last the amen the
[2:09:56] beginning of the creation of god when
[2:09:58] god
[2:09:58] created himself a body he came down and
[2:10:01] lived there
[2:10:02] that's the beginning of the creation of
[2:10:05] god
[2:10:06] and and he said oh isn't that wonderful
[2:10:08] now we find
[2:10:09] at the first i'm an alpha and omega
[2:10:12] this is what he says in the first the
[2:10:14] first of the book of revelation i am
[2:10:16] alpha and omega the beginning
[2:10:19] and the ending says the lord which was
[2:10:23] which is which was and which is to come
[2:10:26] the almighty that's revelation 1 8.
[2:10:29] now so he shows his deity right here in
[2:10:31] the scripture
[2:10:32] he says i am the almighty
[2:10:36] amen i am he that was
[2:10:39] which is and shall come the almighty
[2:10:44] and he says this three times in the very
[2:10:48] right there in the first part of the
[2:10:49] book of revelation to make
[2:10:51] sure we get it that he's not a minor god
[2:10:56] he's not a secondary god he's not just a
[2:10:59] prophet
[2:11:00] he is god
[2:11:04] now to the church of ephesus
[2:11:08] then it comes down to the laodiceans and
[2:11:10] he said i'm the amen
[2:11:12] so i'm the first and the last i'm the
[2:11:14] amen
[2:11:15] i am the beginning of the creation of
[2:11:17] god to the church ages
[2:11:19] you'll have to learn that i am
[2:11:22] god god created in a man form
[2:11:25] i am the beginning of the creation of
[2:11:28] god and he said that would make a
[2:11:29] presbyterian chapter
[2:11:32] amen just think about it beginning of
[2:11:34] the creation god i like that
[2:11:35] the creation of god when god was created
[2:11:38] when god was made flesh
[2:11:40] in jesus christ and dwelt among us
[2:11:44] now this is why when we come to the new
[2:11:47] testament account of genesis
[2:11:50] now here again it's a man moved by the
[2:11:53] spirit
[2:11:54] here is john he's above a disciple john
[2:11:57] 1
[2:11:58] 1. and he goes back and he gives us the
[2:12:00] new testament
[2:12:02] genesis and he says in
[2:12:06] the beginning was the lugos
[2:12:12] the word and the word
[2:12:15] was with god and the
[2:12:18] logos was god
[2:12:22] oh my and the same was in the beginning
[2:12:25] with god
[2:12:26] and by him all things were made by him
[2:12:29] so whoever this
[2:12:30] is is the creator because he made all
[2:12:33] things
[2:12:35] and without him was not anything made
[2:12:37] that was made
[2:12:40] is that right and in him was life
[2:12:44] hello eternal life but i want to go
[2:12:48] beyond that just a moment the arabic
[2:12:50] says it this way
[2:12:51] in him was lies plural
[2:12:55] because you were in him
[2:12:59] in him in the logos in the word
[2:13:03] in the thought of god that became flesh
[2:13:06] come on in the beginning was the word
[2:13:08] the word was with god the word was god
[2:13:11] and in him was lies
[2:13:17] you can't help but come in the
[2:13:19] manifestation
[2:13:22] you cannot stay lost
[2:13:26] hallelujah because in him was your life
[2:13:30] you were in him before the world began
[2:13:34] you were in him you're more than a time
[2:13:38] being
[2:13:39] you are an eternal being
[2:13:46] oh the revelation could just strike your
[2:13:48] heart amen you have come from god
[2:13:52] you became human and you're leaving this
[2:13:54] human life
[2:13:55] to become god again
[2:13:58] immortal eternal
[2:14:02] with him and verse 14
[2:14:05] says and the word the logos
[2:14:09] was made flesh and dwelt among us
[2:14:12] you see the logos made flesh in jesus
[2:14:16] christ
[2:14:16] and we beheld his glory the glory as the
[2:14:20] only begotten of the father
[2:14:21] full of grace and truth so even then
[2:14:25] it was the logos revealing
[2:14:28] the word the angel of the covenant was
[2:14:31] in jesus christ
[2:14:34] if you notice the whole time that jesus
[2:14:37] is here
[2:14:38] pillar of fire is not mentioned is that
[2:14:41] right
[2:14:42] amen but that because the pillar of fire
[2:14:45] came and dwelt
[2:14:47] we can go down to the river jordan just
[2:14:49] for a moment it came down
[2:14:52] like a dove not wasn't a dove
[2:14:55] it came down like a dove it was a
[2:14:59] fluttering whirling fire
[2:15:02] and it comes down like a dove and it
[2:15:04] evokes upon jesus christ
[2:15:06] and dwells in him amen john was told
[2:15:10] that it would come
[2:15:11] and it would abide abode on him
[2:15:15] jesus said when you get it it will abide
[2:15:18] with you
[2:15:19] forever in other words it won't come and
[2:15:22] go
[2:15:23] you want backslide and sin and do this
[2:15:26] and that
[2:15:26] and grieve it away no sir once the holy
[2:15:29] ghost comes
[2:15:30] he abides with you forever you are
[2:15:33] sealed to the day of your redemption
[2:15:35] he never leads you or forsakes you
[2:15:43] now john 14 10 jesus will make it clear
[2:15:47] that what he is preaching is not
[2:15:51] his own thoughts human thoughts
[2:15:54] watch it what's here he would tell you
[2:15:56] first who's living in him
[2:15:58] john 14 10 believeth thou not that i
[2:16:02] am in the father and the father in me
[2:16:05] and the words that i speak to you i
[2:16:07] speak not of myself
[2:16:10] this is not human ability now i'm trying
[2:16:14] to get your mind
[2:16:16] away from your own human abilities well
[2:16:18] i think
[2:16:20] uh-uh we got to be thinking what god
[2:16:22] said
[2:16:23] well the theologian ah we got to be
[2:16:25] saying
[2:16:26] what god said god speaks he's got a word
[2:16:31] watch this jesus said the words that i
[2:16:34] speak to you i speak
[2:16:35] not of myself but the father
[2:16:39] that dwelleth in me he doeth the works
[2:16:43] so who where was the father the the
[2:16:46] pillar of fire the one who had made a
[2:16:48] body
[2:16:50] had come and dwelt in the body
[2:16:54] and it was not the body's own thought it
[2:16:56] was not
[2:16:57] human reason it wasn't something taught
[2:16:59] by mary
[2:17:00] it wasn't something he'd learned by
[2:17:02] rabbis
[2:17:04] it wasn't something he had learned in
[2:17:05] school this had come
[2:17:07] from the father what's now
[2:17:11] he doeth the works he dwelleth in me
[2:17:13] verse 7
[2:17:14] of chapter 7 verse 16 of john
[2:17:17] jesus answered them and said my doctrine
[2:17:20] is not mine but kings that sent me
[2:17:27] amen now who were who who was it that
[2:17:29] sent him the one who sent him came in
[2:17:32] is that right he dwelt in him and he
[2:17:35] said it didn't come from me
[2:17:37] it come from this one dwelling in me
[2:17:41] amen it comes from my father the one who
[2:17:44] created this body
[2:17:46] john 8 28 then jesus said unto them when
[2:17:49] you have lifted up the son of man
[2:17:51] then you shall know that i am that i am
[2:17:54] he and that i do nothing of myself
[2:17:57] but as my father had taught me i
[2:18:00] speak these things so in order to get
[2:18:04] this
[2:18:05] notice now the message of jesus
[2:18:08] did not come from a seminary
[2:18:14] it did not come from halls of learning
[2:18:18] it came from god himself
[2:18:22] revealing the gospel or the good news of
[2:18:26] jesus christ
[2:18:28] now you know again
[2:18:32] you know people will say okay brother
[2:18:34] tim we got that that you know
[2:18:35] that was god now speaking in his son he
[2:18:38] spoke to us in these last days
[2:18:40] so god only speaks now through his son
[2:18:42] brother tim
[2:18:43] after after jesus there are no more
[2:18:45] prophets
[2:18:46] well that's not what paul said
[2:18:50] he taught in ephesians 4 when jesus
[2:18:52] ascended up into heaven
[2:18:54] he sent back gifts to the church
[2:18:55] apostles prophets teachers evangelist
[2:18:57] pastors
[2:18:58] and he continued building up the church
[2:19:01] until
[2:19:02] upon the foundation that jesus himself
[2:19:04] gave because jesus christ would be the
[2:19:06] chief cornerstone
[2:19:07] is that right but paul now was one who
[2:19:11] had a right
[2:19:14] paul had a right to pride himself
[2:19:19] as a learned man
[2:19:23] but the new testament that he wrote
[2:19:26] didn't come from that school
[2:19:30] it came from the pillar of fire
[2:19:33] it was that light that met him on the
[2:19:36] road to damascus
[2:19:37] who identified himself as the one who
[2:19:41] dwelt in jesus christ
[2:19:43] he would strike him down on the road
[2:19:44] damascus with a
[2:19:46] bright light a pillar of fire come on
[2:19:50] and there he would fall down in the dust
[2:19:52] of the of the
[2:19:53] of the uh on the road and he would say
[2:19:56] who art thou lord because he knew that
[2:19:59] light
[2:20:01] was the lord whoever he was and he was
[2:20:04] saying i want to know your name
[2:20:07] who are you
[2:20:10] and he said i have jesus
[2:20:14] while persecutors without me
[2:20:19] because this is what he said why do you
[2:20:22] persecute me
[2:20:23] and he said who are you
[2:20:26] i'm trying to defend you i'm trying to
[2:20:29] stand for
[2:20:30] the law i'm trying to stand for jehovah
[2:20:32] who are you
[2:20:34] lord and he says i'm jesus
[2:20:39] so this is it's going to be hard to kick
[2:20:41] against the pricks
[2:20:45] because the sharpened wood on the on a
[2:20:48] cart
[2:20:49] that an animal would pull you know would
[2:20:51] would be there and they'd go to kick it
[2:20:53] it poked them as they kicked back
[2:20:56] against the cart
[2:20:57] and he says it's going to be hard
[2:21:00] kicking against the pricks
[2:21:03] why did you persecute me when you
[2:21:04] persecuted my people
[2:21:06] you persecuted me whatever you do to my
[2:21:09] church you're doing to me
[2:21:12] amen now as again
[2:21:16] he that light identified himself as the
[2:21:19] same one
[2:21:21] that wasn't jesus said that's my name
[2:21:23] amen
[2:21:25] i am that i am he's asking the same
[2:21:28] question that moses did who art thy lord
[2:21:33] what is your name i'm jesus
[2:21:40] he had pride he had lots of learning
[2:21:44] i want to just talk about this for a
[2:21:45] moment this
[2:21:48] this man he says in acts
[2:21:51] 22 and 3 i'm barely a man
[2:21:54] which i'm a jew born in tarsus
[2:21:58] a city in silica cicelia
[2:22:01] were yet brought up in this city at the
[2:22:04] feet of gamalia
[2:22:06] and taught according to the perfect
[2:22:08] manner of the law of the fathers and was
[2:22:10] zealous toward god
[2:22:12] as he are ye all are this day
[2:22:16] so paul says i've got all them awards
[2:22:21] i walked down the aisle there you know
[2:22:24] with pomp and circumstance you know
[2:22:27] i was in i was in the cumulative
[2:22:32] i was in this and i was in the host
[2:22:34] society and
[2:22:35] i i had the diplomas
[2:22:38] i had the phd behind my name and the lld
[2:22:42] and the
[2:22:42] dd i had it all
[2:22:46] am i was cocky i was so sure i was right
[2:22:51] boy i was educating all these letters
[2:22:53] underneath me they can't
[2:22:55] they're less than i am because i can
[2:22:57] judge a man's intelligence because how
[2:22:58] many degrees he has
[2:23:03] no none of them's are intelligent like i
[2:23:05] am them sorry things that
[2:23:06] them scum bags i'm going to kill them
[2:23:08] all
[2:23:12] he was cocky so sure he was right he
[2:23:15] persecuted the church
[2:23:16] do you know in the book of acts that
[2:23:19] church was called the way
[2:23:20] that's right that's what they call the
[2:23:23] christians call themselves we're in the
[2:23:25] way
[2:23:25] that's right we're the way
[2:23:28] you want to be saved we're the way. you
[2:23:31] want to go to heaven we're the way
[2:23:33] this one who led us is the way he's the
[2:23:35] way the truth and the life we're the
[2:23:36] way.
[2:23:38] this is the message
[2:23:42] somebody with me amen and i persecuted
[2:23:45] them
[2:23:46] because they called themselves the way
[2:23:49] and we were
[2:23:50] we were the ones we're the ones we're
[2:23:53] the we're
[2:23:55] why they don't know nothing they ain't
[2:23:58] got
[2:23:59] they've never been to bible school what
[2:24:02] are they doing handling the word
[2:24:05] ignorant learned peter preaching stuff
[2:24:08] oh he has no right to even preach
[2:24:12] don't that sound familiar william
[2:24:15] branham prayed and you called to pray
[2:24:16] for the sick he wasn't to preach the
[2:24:18] gospel
[2:24:20] he never was sent by us
[2:24:24] he don't have the degrees there's no phd
[2:24:28] behind his name
[2:24:30] there's nobody there's no credentials of
[2:24:32] man
[2:24:34] why what right what right does he have
[2:24:36] to preach these things
[2:24:37] he was not a preacher he was not a
[2:24:39] teacher
[2:24:41] he was to pray for the sick he had to
[2:24:42] get to healing he didn't know his
[2:24:43] calling
[2:24:45] because we're the ones we've got the phd
[2:24:49] in the lld and the dd and we're
[2:24:51] recognized by men in colleges and we
[2:24:54] walk down the silver cords and gold
[2:24:56] cords around our neck and
[2:24:57] you know with our gowns on in our house
[2:24:59] and we threw them up and
[2:25:00] we shouted and everybody put a big label
[2:25:03] on us and
[2:25:04] we're now a doctor
[2:25:08] well let me tell you what paul did with
[2:25:10] his doctrine
[2:25:12] what some of you need to do with your
[2:25:14] own knowledge
[2:25:17] philippians chapter 3 and verse 4 though
[2:25:20] i might have confidence in the flesh
[2:25:23] if any man thinketh he hath whereof he
[2:25:26] might
[2:25:26] trust in his flesh i moare
[2:25:31] circumcised the eighth day on the of the
[2:25:34] stock of israel of the tribe of
[2:25:36] benjamin a hebrew of the hebrews
[2:25:41] he thought pretty well of himself didn't
[2:25:42] he as touching the law
[2:25:45] of pharisee we did it every bit right
[2:25:49] down to the nitty-gritty we wouldn't
[2:25:51] even say the name of god till we lost it
[2:25:54] nobody knows how to say it no more
[2:25:57] concerning zeal persecuting the church
[2:26:00] touching righteousness which is in the
[2:26:03] law as blameless
[2:26:07] but what things were gained to me
[2:26:11] then i counted loss for christ
[2:26:16] yay doubtless and i count all things but
[2:26:18] lost
[2:26:19] for the excellency for this knowledge of
[2:26:22] christ
[2:26:23] jesus my lord i count it all for loss
[2:26:27] i forget everything every man ever
[2:26:30] taught me
[2:26:31] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[2:26:34] christ jesus my lord
[2:26:35] for whom i've suffered the loss of all
[2:26:38] things and to count
[2:26:39] them but done
[2:26:43] that i may win christ
[2:26:46] that's what paul did with his knowledge
[2:26:49] he said they're just a bunch of dung
[2:26:54] i count it as nothing just
[2:26:57] dirty mess of man are you with me
[2:27:01] so i can win christ that's right
[2:27:05] now paul knew that god couldn't use the
[2:27:08] knowledge
[2:27:09] and the understanding that he had
[2:27:11] received from one of the most learned
[2:27:13] rabbis of the day gamalia
[2:27:17] his name was renowned he was
[2:27:20] the rabbi the rabbi the teacher
[2:27:26] and like moses killed in the learning of
[2:27:28] physique
[2:27:29] of the of the egyptians remember some of
[2:27:32] them
[2:27:32] must kill people of the day builders of
[2:27:36] pyramids speaks
[2:27:38] they could embalm bodies they could make
[2:27:40] them where they could
[2:27:41] last thousands of years he said
[2:27:44] i esteem the reproach of christ greater
[2:27:48] than all that knowledge
[2:27:52] now that's the problem with
[2:27:53] denominations
[2:27:56] they can receive the dogmas and the
[2:27:58] teachings from the seminary
[2:28:00] but they can't receive revelation
[2:28:07] yet the church is to be built on
[2:28:10] revelations
[2:28:12] jesus said on this rock peter flesh and
[2:28:15] blood didn't reveal to you my father
[2:28:17] revealed it to you
[2:28:18] so on this this rock on the revelation
[2:28:21] of who i am
[2:28:24] i'll build my church
[2:28:27] now we come right back to it again
[2:28:29] remember again
[2:28:31] that's got to be our foundation that we
[2:28:33] know
[2:28:34] in whom we have believed that we know
[2:28:37] this is not a message with just the
[2:28:40] thinking of a mortal man this
[2:28:42] is almighty god
[2:28:45] [Music]
[2:28:46] don't look at the messenger look at the
[2:28:49] message
[2:28:51] and look at the vindication
[2:28:59] watch anointed once at the end time what
[2:29:01] is faith faith is something that's
[2:29:03] revealed to you that is not yet
[2:29:05] but you you believe it will be faith is
[2:29:08] a revelation
[2:29:09] of the will of god so by revelation and
[2:29:11] churches today
[2:29:13] don't even believe in spiritual
[2:29:15] revelation they believe in a dogmatic
[2:29:17] teaching of some system
[2:29:19] by revelation abel taught or offered
[2:29:22] unto god a more excellent sacrifice than
[2:29:24] that of cain
[2:29:26] which god testified he was righteous
[2:29:28] amen i hope you see that see what
[2:29:31] where we're living see the hour i was
[2:29:33] talking to a gentleman
[2:29:34] not long ago a christian scholar and a
[2:29:36] gentleman and he said brother
[2:29:37] mr branham we refuse all revelation then
[2:29:39] he said you have to refuse jesus christ
[2:29:42] because he was the revelation of god god
[2:29:46] revealed in human flesh
[2:29:47] and unless you see it you're lost
[2:29:52] and that's the problem that most critics
[2:29:55] have
[2:29:55] with brother branham is that he wasn't
[2:29:58] taught
[2:29:58] by man paul was
[2:30:02] but he had to count it all but lost
[2:30:05] and then he would guarantee he would
[2:30:08] guarantee if
[2:30:09] this is not amount it is from
[2:30:12] god i didn't get my message from
[2:30:16] man i got it from god i certify
[2:30:20] [Applause]
[2:30:23] in fact for the matter he was so sure of
[2:30:26] it he said to preach or
[2:30:27] teach anything different than what i
[2:30:29] preached let it be accursed
[2:30:35] he was so sure it was god
[2:30:39] galatians 1 6 i marvel that you're so
[2:30:42] removed from him who called you into
[2:30:44] grace
[2:30:45] unto another gospel you see to believe
[2:30:47] something different
[2:30:48] you have to remove yourself from christ
[2:30:51] which is not another but there be some
[2:30:53] that trouble you
[2:30:54] and would pervert the gospel of christ
[2:30:57] and that perversion
[2:30:58] has went on and on and on and on and
[2:31:01] produced every denominational system
[2:31:03] there is today perversion of the
[2:31:06] original gospel
[2:31:09] but though we are an angel from heaven
[2:31:11] preach any other gospel
[2:31:13] unto you that what we have preached unto
[2:31:15] you let it be accursed
[2:31:18] as we said before so and i now i say now
[2:31:22] again
[2:31:23] if any man preach any other gospel unto
[2:31:26] you
[2:31:27] then you have received let him be
[2:31:30] accursed for do i now persuade men or
[2:31:34] god
[2:31:35] or do i seek to please men for if i
[2:31:38] yet please men i should not be the
[2:31:40] servant of christ
[2:31:43] so he said you know if i'm going to
[2:31:46] please man
[2:31:47] i can't be christ's servants if i'm
[2:31:49] going to be christ's servant it ain't
[2:31:51] going to please man
[2:31:53] but i certify what's these words
[2:31:57] i guarantee you i give you this
[2:32:01] guarantee that the gospel preached of me
[2:32:04] is
[2:32:04] not after man
[2:32:07] for neither i received it of man neither
[2:32:10] was i taught it
[2:32:12] but by the revelation of jesus christ
[2:32:16] now he had met jesus christ where in the
[2:32:19] pill of fire
[2:32:20] and it was the pillar of fire who taught
[2:32:22] him
[2:32:23] the revelation i'm trying to get to you
[2:32:27] to understand
[2:32:28] this is where true revelation
[2:32:32] and the divine interpretation of the
[2:32:34] word comes from
[2:32:35] is from the purify himself because
[2:32:38] no man has a right to interpret it only
[2:32:41] god himself
[2:32:42] for he is his own interpreter
[2:32:48] you've heard of my conversion my life or
[2:32:51] my conversation
[2:32:52] rather my life in time past in the
[2:32:55] jewish religion how beyond measure
[2:32:57] i persecuted the church of god i wasted
[2:32:59] it i profited i
[2:33:01] excelled in the jews religion above mine
[2:33:03] equals in mine own nation
[2:33:05] been more zealous of the of the
[2:33:08] traditions of my fathers but
[2:33:10] when it pleased god who separated me
[2:33:14] from my mother's womb and called me by
[2:33:16] his grace
[2:33:17] isn't this amazing when he please god
[2:33:20] you remember
[2:33:20] you were you were lost out in sin but
[2:33:23] when it pleased god
[2:33:25] he stopped you amen on your road down to
[2:33:28] damascus
[2:33:30] i mean he knocked you off your high
[2:33:32] horse he got you down in the dust
[2:33:34] until you begin to cry who are the lord
[2:33:37] i got to know you jesus
[2:33:42] and he says who separated me from my
[2:33:45] mother's womb called me by his grace to
[2:33:47] reveal
[2:33:48] his son in me so he said my
[2:33:52] revelation is a revelation of jesus
[2:33:55] christ
[2:33:56] that i might preach him among the
[2:34:00] heathen
[2:34:02] now notice i want to give something
[2:34:04] listen pray we are
[2:34:05] not preaching william branham we are not
[2:34:08] preaching william branham's thoughts
[2:34:10] we are preaching christ who has been
[2:34:13] revealed
[2:34:15] in his own word not outside the word but
[2:34:19] at the word
[2:34:21] now he said i confer not with flesh and
[2:34:24] blood
[2:34:25] oh listen immediately i didn't go talk
[2:34:27] to man about it
[2:34:28] neither when i went up to jerusalem to
[2:34:30] them that were apostles before me
[2:34:32] but i went to arabia over to the desert
[2:34:34] i returned again to damascus
[2:34:36] after three years i went up to to
[2:34:38] jerusalem to see
[2:34:40] peter and abode with him 15 days and but
[2:34:43] other apostles saw and unsaved james the
[2:34:46] lord's brother
[2:34:47] now these things which i write unto you
[2:34:49] behold
[2:34:50] before god i lie not
[2:34:54] amen notice this
[2:34:57] i'm certifying i'm guaranteeing you
[2:35:00] i didn't even get this from the
[2:35:02] disciples
[2:35:04] i've got this from the pillar fire
[2:35:06] himself
[2:35:07] and he's the one that helped me to write
[2:35:10] the new covenant
[2:35:14] and if any man thinks he's a prophet or
[2:35:16] if he's spiritual
[2:35:18] let him acknowledge that what i said to
[2:35:20] be the truth
[2:35:24] so we're going to have paul's gospel
[2:35:27] restored again
[2:35:29] it must be restored by jesus himself
[2:35:33] the pillar of fire and it can't come
[2:35:37] through human understandings of the
[2:35:39] bible it cannot come that way
[2:35:41] you see it just that would just make
[2:35:43] another
[2:35:44] another organization another
[2:35:46] denomination and we already got
[2:35:48] 40 000 different interpretations of the
[2:35:52] bible
[2:35:52] upon which manna denominated dear god we
[2:35:55] don't need another one
[2:35:57] amen all of them have been taught by a
[2:35:59] man and not
[2:36:01] one of them shall i say it
[2:36:04] not one of them teach paul's gospel
[2:36:08] holiness well they don't agree with paul
[2:36:11] they don't believe what what old paul
[2:36:12] said let me that was not
[2:36:14] all paul that was the angel of god
[2:36:19] are you with me oh they don't agree with
[2:36:22] paul
[2:36:23] no no no oh that was not for us you know
[2:36:25] that i tell you
[2:36:26] we've decided who are we who do you
[2:36:29] think you are
[2:36:30] the angel revealed it
[2:36:33] and you go against the angel listen let
[2:36:36] me tell you
[2:36:36] you go against the angel if an angel
[2:36:39] from heaven
[2:36:40] anyone preaches or adheres to any other
[2:36:43] gospel
[2:36:44] that's what i preach to you he's cursed
[2:36:46] you bring yourself
[2:36:48] under your own curse by denying paul's
[2:36:52] gospel
[2:36:53] because i certify it didn't come from
[2:36:56] man
[2:36:56] it came from a pillar of fire
[2:36:59] [Applause]
[2:37:00] amen the same one that wrote the old
[2:37:03] testament
[2:37:04] well i'll tell you what we don't believe
[2:37:05] the old testament the same one
[2:37:07] who are wrote the old testament is the
[2:37:09] same one who wrote the new testament
[2:37:12] he's the same god it's the same word
[2:37:15] it's the same problem
[2:37:20] amen water baptism
[2:37:24] they don't agree with paul godhead they
[2:37:27] don't teach what he teaches preached
[2:37:32] you see they believe they can change it
[2:37:35] they believe their idea above it is
[2:37:37] better than what old paul had
[2:37:39] when paul met him down in acts 19 he
[2:37:42] says how was you baptized
[2:37:45] well like john baptized he said you
[2:37:47] wasn't baptized in the name of jesus
[2:37:48] christ
[2:37:49] he said go and get it done over again
[2:37:54] because there's only one salvation in
[2:37:55] one name
[2:37:58] come on you say well it has nothing to
[2:38:02] do with salvation he that believeth and
[2:38:04] is baptized shall be saved
[2:38:07] he that believeth not shall be damned
[2:38:10] god is the interpreter brother brandon
[2:38:12] said i was speaking here not long ago in
[2:38:13] a meeting
[2:38:14] a man said to me brother branham you
[2:38:16] have the wrong interpretation
[2:38:17] you don't interpret that right they go
[2:38:20] the methodist and they say
[2:38:22] the baptists don't interpret it right
[2:38:25] the baptists say
[2:38:26] the pentecost was done the pentacles say
[2:38:29] the wonders don't the one to say the
[2:38:30] assemblies don't and each one
[2:38:32] says the others don't god is his own
[2:38:35] interpreter
[2:38:37] he don't need anyone to interpret for
[2:38:39] him he does his own interpreting
[2:38:42] who is the man that can interpret god
[2:38:44] god
[2:38:45] is his own interpreter
[2:38:50] now listen this was the fault
[2:38:53] they found in jesus amen
[2:38:57] same fault he wasn't taught a man
[2:39:00] matthew 13 54 when he come to his own
[2:39:03] country
[2:39:04] he taught them in their synagogue in as
[2:39:07] much
[2:39:07] as they were astonished and they said
[2:39:10] well have this man this
[2:39:11] wisdom and these mighty works is not
[2:39:15] this the carpenter's son
[2:39:16] is not his mother called mary and his
[2:39:19] brethren
[2:39:20] james joseph and simon and judas and
[2:39:23] and his sisters are they not all with us
[2:39:25] which then have
[2:39:27] this man all these things and they were
[2:39:29] offended
[2:39:30] in him that that means that was a
[2:39:33] stumbling block to them
[2:39:38] the scriptural way for the word to be
[2:39:42] revealed was
[2:39:42] never through a seminary
[2:39:45] you showed me one place in the bible
[2:39:48] that the word of the lord came to a
[2:39:50] seminary
[2:39:52] in the license day it was the school of
[2:39:55] the prophets
[2:39:56] that elijah went up into heaven and then
[2:39:59] and they said
[2:40:00] well perhaps the lord just took him up
[2:40:02] and cast him on a mountain down into a
[2:40:04] valley it was a school of the prophets
[2:40:07] that threw wild gourds
[2:40:08] into a pot and death was in the pot
[2:40:13] it was the prophet elijah who said bring
[2:40:15] me some meal
[2:40:16] which represented christ and he threw it
[2:40:18] in there and the pot was healed
[2:40:20] and that's the only thing that healed
[2:40:22] the false doctrine is get christ back in
[2:40:24] the midst
[2:40:25] [Applause]
[2:40:26] amen you see it was the rabbis and the
[2:40:30] teachers of the law
[2:40:31] was the one who got the message
[2:40:33] distorted they're the ones who through
[2:40:35] their stupidity
[2:40:37] and legalism lost how to even say the
[2:40:40] name of god
[2:40:43] they couldn't even now say they're all
[2:40:45] god's names
[2:40:48] but now god would send a message down
[2:40:51] and say
[2:40:52] thou shalt call his name jesus jehovah's
[2:40:55] savior and there
[2:40:56] and there will be no salvation there'll
[2:40:58] be no deliverance there won't be no
[2:41:00] healing except by that name
[2:41:05] amen that's what the bible said acts 4
[2:41:09] 12
[2:41:10] neither is there any salvation in any
[2:41:12] other
[2:41:13] for there is none other name under
[2:41:16] heaven given among men whereby
[2:41:18] we might be saved father won't save you
[2:41:22] come on a man's son won't save you
[2:41:25] holy ghost won't save you melchizedek
[2:41:28] won't save you
[2:41:30] lily of the valley black morning star
[2:41:32] there is no salvation in any of those
[2:41:35] there is only one name in which
[2:41:37] redemption is
[2:41:39] and that's the name of jesus christ and
[2:41:41] there's nowhere in
[2:41:42] any place in the bible anywhere where
[2:41:44] anybody was ever baptized
[2:41:46] except to be taken in that name
[2:41:52] all to the book of acts it's a name that
[2:41:55] rebukes sickness
[2:41:57] heal diseases save the lost
[2:42:00] now coming down i'm going to be closing
[2:42:04] here in a few minutes
[2:42:05] but i want to get it down to you at
[2:42:07] least that we can get some of this
[2:42:09] he said brother branham would talk about
[2:42:12] things
[2:42:13] now do we remember the angel lord came
[2:42:16] to him
[2:42:17] there in 1946 it was a pillar of fire
[2:42:21] and out of that walk to man
[2:42:23] he was six foot tall head on a white
[2:42:26] garment down his feet his
[2:42:28] hair was down down down about shoulder
[2:42:32] length
[2:42:33] and he stood there in into
[2:42:36] with brother branham he began to say i
[2:42:39] am sent from the presence of almighty
[2:42:40] god he just stepped out of that pillar
[2:42:42] of fire
[2:42:43] to tell you about your misunderstood
[2:42:46] life
[2:42:46] and your strengths ways and to
[2:42:49] commission you and tell you that you're
[2:42:50] to take a gift of healing
[2:42:52] to the sick people and i will be with
[2:42:55] you don't worry about what you'll say
[2:42:57] i will put the words in your mouth you
[2:43:00] remember that
[2:43:02] now it would be this angel
[2:43:06] service after service
[2:43:09] somebody with me this pillar of fire
[2:43:12] that would tell
[2:43:13] their names their address your name is
[2:43:16] eva
[2:43:17] york you're from 613
[2:43:21] 6th street you're you're you're healed
[2:43:25] it would tell them you know right down
[2:43:28] to the minute
[2:43:29] details of their lives because it was
[2:43:32] the logos
[2:43:34] using the voice of a man can you help me
[2:43:38] preach now
[2:43:39] he said and he said one time i read in
[2:43:41] the bible about hell
[2:43:45] and i began to read that the word hell
[2:43:47] came from the word hades which meant the
[2:43:49] grave
[2:43:50] and i was about three or four years i
[2:43:52] wouldn't preach on the subject of hell
[2:43:54] because one place it looked like it was
[2:43:56] a burning fire the next place it looked
[2:43:58] like it was a grave
[2:44:00] until i found the truth of it then i got
[2:44:03] to know
[2:44:04] exactly what it was and by the help
[2:44:07] of the angel of the lord that revealed
[2:44:10] it to me
[2:44:12] because i didn't get any schooling
[2:44:15] thank god and i just hold on to
[2:44:18] scripture and pray
[2:44:19] and search until the scripture the
[2:44:21] scripture until
[2:44:22] she comes and reveals it to me and when
[2:44:26] he stands before me in that light
[2:44:28] you see on the picture and reveals it
[2:44:31] every time
[2:44:32] it is perfect with the scripture through
[2:44:34] and through
[2:44:36] that's the reason i know it's the angel
[2:44:38] lord because he bears witness
[2:44:40] of his word and if that angel told me
[2:44:42] one thing that wasn't scriptural
[2:44:44] i would not believe him it's got to be
[2:44:47] with the word first god's word is
[2:44:49] eternal because
[2:44:50] an angel could come and preach something
[2:44:52] else paul said it wasn't right
[2:44:54] but if it's the word of god the angel of
[2:44:57] god will
[2:44:58] verify that word every time to be the
[2:45:01] truth
[2:45:01] if it's a true angel from the lord if
[2:45:04] it's something of color
[2:45:05] then don't you listen to it but if an
[2:45:06] angel comes and speaks
[2:45:08] and says just exactly what the word says
[2:45:10] then that angel
[2:45:12] is from god
[2:45:16] hallelujah now just
[2:45:19] as accurate as knowing the heart
[2:45:24] the angel brought the word
[2:45:29] it's a dark spirit of death around you
[2:45:32] it's in the form of cancer in the heart
[2:45:35] the doctor is a strong man
[2:45:38] you're examined by you gotta rupture
[2:45:40] condition the bowels
[2:45:42] you've got a stomach trouble besides you
[2:45:45] have a severe heart trouble that's
[2:45:46] caused you fainting
[2:45:48] a few days ago you were sitting on the
[2:45:50] side of the bed
[2:45:51] looking out toward your windows and
[2:45:53] nearly passed out
[2:45:55] your name is eva york you live in this
[2:45:59] city
[2:46:00] 613th 6th street you're going home to be
[2:46:03] well
[2:46:08] did he miss it did it fail
[2:46:11] not once of the thousands of times if it
[2:46:14] was that accurate
[2:46:16] come on then how about the what the
[2:46:19] angel
[2:46:20] said about the bible
[2:46:28] there was an entourage came to brother
[2:46:31] branham and told him said
[2:46:32] look if you'll just tell us what you're
[2:46:34] preaching about baptism in jesus name
[2:46:37] and the godhead and
[2:46:38] things like that so we'll believe you if
[2:46:40] you'll tell us the angel said it will
[2:46:42] believe you he said
[2:46:43] if the angel lord said anything contrary
[2:46:45] to that
[2:46:46] it wouldn't be the angel lord and he
[2:46:50] said
[2:46:50] you know if a man tells you a messenger
[2:46:52] from god says he's from god and tell you
[2:46:54] it's right to be baptized in the name of
[2:46:56] father son the holy ghost let him be a
[2:46:58] liar
[2:46:59] if a man tells you it's all right for
[2:47:01] you to wear bobbed hair and things like
[2:47:03] that you ought to cover with a hat
[2:47:04] in the church for a bonnet to be a
[2:47:06] covered let him be a liar
[2:47:08] the word of god is the truth and and any
[2:47:11] of those
[2:47:11] these things that is against the word
[2:47:13] let them be a lie
[2:47:15] it's the word it's the truth it'll stand
[2:47:19] now even the book of revelation how many
[2:47:22] believes the book of revelation
[2:47:24] well the book of revelation he says is
[2:47:26] one revelation one and one the
[2:47:28] revelation of jesus christ
[2:47:30] which god gave to him to show in his
[2:47:32] service things which must shortly come
[2:47:34] to pass
[2:47:35] and he sent it and signified it that
[2:47:37] means
[2:47:38] made it known by his angel
[2:47:42] to his servant john i'm trying to show
[2:47:44] you the entire bible
[2:47:47] not just the old testament but even
[2:47:50] jesus own ministry
[2:47:51] was from the father himself and the
[2:47:54] angel of the covenant
[2:47:56] brings even the book of revelation
[2:48:00] and he makes it known he signifies it by
[2:48:03] his angel
[2:48:05] to what his servant john now john's the
[2:48:08] messenger
[2:48:08] he writes down he's the scribe but it's
[2:48:11] the holy ghost
[2:48:14] that is bringing a message
[2:48:17] and i want to get you again let us
[2:48:20] certify it the message we've been seeing
[2:48:22] is not a man's message it's god's
[2:48:28] message
[2:48:32] blessed is he that readeth and they they
[2:48:33] hear the words of this prophecy
[2:48:35] and keep the things that are written in
[2:48:37] the end and they're in for
[2:48:38] the time is at hand look here it's the
[2:48:42] only
[2:48:42] it's it's the only book in the bible
[2:48:45] that's written by jesus christ
[2:48:47] in that manner he comes and appears to
[2:48:49] him and says signifies it
[2:48:51] to servant john personally reveal it to
[2:48:53] a scribe
[2:48:55] what is it it's the same pillar of fire
[2:48:58] that led the children of israel amen out
[2:49:01] of egypt
[2:49:01] into the promised land it's the same
[2:49:04] pillar of fire
[2:49:05] that wrote the law it's the same pillar
[2:49:08] of fire
[2:49:09] somebody with me amen that will lead
[2:49:11] joshua into the promised land
[2:49:13] and the conquest of that land it's the
[2:49:16] same pillar of fire
[2:49:17] that was with daniel in the lion's den
[2:49:21] hallelujah when the animals were afraid
[2:49:23] of that milling
[2:49:24] whipping fire and stood away from him
[2:49:28] it's the same one the fourth man that
[2:49:30] was there in the fiery furnace
[2:49:34] hallelujah it's that same one that we
[2:49:36] are following today
[2:49:38] not another but the same pillar of fire
[2:49:42] the same holy ghost we are a people
[2:49:45] led by the pillar of fire
[2:49:51] not another man's ideas not another
[2:49:53] man's wisdom
[2:49:56] but a pillar of fire god wants you to
[2:49:59] have confidence
[2:50:01] so he would show you sign after sign
[2:50:03] this is what he did with moses
[2:50:04] so that you'll know you were sent here
[2:50:07] take this rock
[2:50:08] cast it down it becomes a sermon see you
[2:50:10] can bind
[2:50:11] the king's serpent
[2:50:15] swallow him up this is what's going to
[2:50:18] happen
[2:50:19] under your ministry you're going to
[2:50:20] swallow up his whole army
[2:50:22] you'll take them down the red sea and
[2:50:23] they'll all die
[2:50:25] come on amen you know put your hand in
[2:50:28] your bosom bring it out
[2:50:30] it's leprous put it back in hey man it's
[2:50:33] white as snow
[2:50:35] right and then this was the condition
[2:50:37] this was the condition of every man
[2:50:39] he was leprous full of sin but put it
[2:50:42] there in the bosom of christ
[2:50:44] in the heart of christ where he was
[2:50:46] wounded for our transgression
[2:50:47] and bruised for our iniquity and pull it
[2:50:50] back out and it's
[2:50:51] white it's clean now rather it's clean
[2:50:53] it's no longer leprous with sin anymore
[2:50:57] that's the power that lays in the word
[2:51:00] it'll set the violet center free free
[2:51:03] it'll heal our
[2:51:05] it'll raise the dead he'll open the eyes
[2:51:07] of the fire
[2:51:08] he'll give hearing to the death it'll
[2:51:10] make brain bleed
[2:51:11] ain't meant to dissipate and go away
[2:51:13] it'll make anthony banish in a moment
[2:51:16] it is there because he said i am god
[2:51:19] nothing i will be but the i
[2:51:21] am and he's trying to show you
[2:51:25] this is the one who's speaking to you
[2:51:28] and didn't come from a seminary
[2:51:31] and if it did well if it came to the
[2:51:33] fact that some methodists don't want it
[2:51:35] if it came to the methodists the
[2:51:36] pentecostals don't want it
[2:51:37] you know but it came from god and i'm on
[2:51:40] it
[2:51:42] how about you it came from god and i
[2:51:44] want it it's
[2:51:45] my message it spoke to me because in him
[2:51:49] is life
[2:51:50] in him with lies and i was in him
[2:51:54] [Applause]
[2:51:58] hallelujah
[2:52:00] now then i'm bringing it right down
[2:52:04] to this because jesus would say
[2:52:10] i came from god i'm going back to god
[2:52:15] so where's that in the bible brother tim
[2:52:18] because watch him now he come from the
[2:52:21] pillar of fire
[2:52:23] he become flesh with the spirit of god
[2:52:26] overshadowing the virgin making a body
[2:52:29] the pillar of heart comes and dwells in
[2:52:31] him
[2:52:35] teaches him brings us the gospel
[2:52:41] now watch he's crucified
[2:52:45] he's raised up he's ascends back into
[2:52:47] glory
[2:52:48] his body now is immortal
[2:52:51] can never die again it is the only image
[2:52:55] of the father you'll ever see
[2:53:01] because no man has seen god at any time
[2:53:03] but the only begotten of the father he
[2:53:05] hath declared him
[2:53:07] and one day when you look for god you
[2:53:09] will see jesus
[2:53:13] christ
[2:53:18] but he says i come he said to paul i
[2:53:20] came from the spirit world
[2:53:22] i go back to spirit again
[2:53:26] this is why he would say if i don't
[2:53:29] leave
[2:53:30] the comforter can't come but if i go
[2:53:34] away
[2:53:35] then i can send the spirit that is in me
[2:53:37] back
[2:53:40] for he dwelleth in me now but he shall
[2:53:43] be with you
[2:53:44] and in you john 8
[2:53:47] 42 notice now this flesh
[2:53:51] was brought here for sacrifice to redeem
[2:53:53] us as sinners
[2:53:56] so the pillar of fire would become flesh
[2:53:58] john 8 42
[2:53:59] jesus said unto them if god were your
[2:54:01] father you would love me
[2:54:03] i proceeded forth
[2:54:06] and i came from god and neither came i
[2:54:09] myself but he sent me
[2:54:11] so jesus said i came out of
[2:54:15] that pillar of fire
[2:54:20] watch now verse 23 of chapter 13
[2:54:24] jesus knowing the father had given him
[2:54:26] all things in his hands and he said
[2:54:28] he was come from god and he
[2:54:31] went to god so notice here john 3
[2:54:35] 13 3 adriana jesus knowing the father
[2:54:39] had given him all things in the hand
[2:54:41] and that he was come from god
[2:54:44] and went to god so he came from god
[2:54:48] to become flesh man for god to dwell in
[2:54:52] but he would return back to being god
[2:55:00] again
[2:55:02] john 16 30. for are we
[2:55:06] now are we sure that thou knowest all
[2:55:08] things and needeth not that any man
[2:55:10] asked thee for by this we believe thou
[2:55:14] came us forth from god
[2:55:18] so there's three witnesses of the
[2:55:20] scripture
[2:55:22] so the body of jesus sits at the right
[2:55:24] hand of god
[2:55:26] in heaven on his throne but his spirit
[2:55:30] is here on the earth
[2:55:33] now remember the whole purpose that he
[2:55:35] come
[2:55:37] was because god wanted a family
[2:55:41] and he wanted them all born of the same
[2:55:44] spirit
[2:55:45] that he was and he couldn't call you
[2:55:48] family
[2:55:49] and you being a sinful human being
[2:55:54] because to really be family you would
[2:55:56] have to be of his
[2:55:57] genus right
[2:56:01] amen so there on the day of pentecost
[2:56:06] what happened the pillar of fire came
[2:56:09] down
[2:56:10] the logos the same one
[2:56:14] that led to children of israel the same
[2:56:17] one
[2:56:18] that was in jesus christ the same one
[2:56:21] come on that was on the road to damascus
[2:56:23] and said i am jesus
[2:56:24] the same one comes down on the day of
[2:56:27] pentecost
[2:56:28] and it comes like it comes whipping and
[2:56:30] whirling like a
[2:56:32] rushing mighty wind
[2:56:37] hovering pillar of fire and it's moving
[2:56:39] around
[2:56:40] and there's licks that begin to fall off
[2:56:42] of it
[2:56:43] and god has those licks to fall on 120
[2:56:47] in the upper room
[2:56:50] what was he doing birthing sons and
[2:56:52] daughters of god
[2:56:55] so that you are no longer born of the
[2:56:57] flesh
[2:56:58] nor of the will of man but of god
[2:57:04] hallelujah amen that you can be of the
[2:57:07] same creation that he wants
[2:57:09] come on and there's more in you than
[2:57:11] just human life
[2:57:13] there is god's own sowing life in you
[2:57:16] and you can no more perish than god can
[2:57:18] perish
[2:57:21] hallelujah for now that pillar of fire
[2:57:24] is residing
[2:57:25] in every person that's why when they
[2:57:29] would walk up there
[2:57:30] in the prayer line and brother branham
[2:57:32] said i see you're a christian
[2:57:34] your spirit is welcomed by this pillar
[2:57:37] of fire that is here
[2:57:38] your kinfolk
[2:57:43] there's something about it friends when
[2:57:46] you know him
[2:57:47] and you've been born in him you're
[2:57:49] kinfolk
[2:57:50] and you can't deny him you can't deny
[2:57:54] his word
[2:57:55] you can't deny his promises because you
[2:57:59] and the word are one
[2:58:03] you're born of the word and one day
[2:58:06] one day one day
[2:58:12] it's going to come together of that
[2:58:14] theopenic form of you
[2:58:16] to meet with this body here
[2:58:19] and as the lights come together and mesh
[2:58:22] together
[2:58:24] you'll change from mortal to
[2:58:30] immortality
[2:58:37] what a day that will be let's stand
[2:58:39] together musicians come
[2:58:46] jesus was god in the form of a man
[2:58:49] that's so hard for people to swallow he
[2:58:52] was god he was
[2:58:53] nothing less than god he was god
[2:58:57] manifested in the flesh he no junior god
[2:59:01] he's not just a prophet he's almighty
[2:59:04] god himself
[2:59:07] god came the pillar of fire come and
[2:59:09] dwelt in a human body
[2:59:13] and walked among us then we'll offer
[2:59:16] that body for
[2:59:17] for your sacrifice to be the lamb of god
[2:59:20] to take away
[2:59:21] your sins for he was the lamb slain
[2:59:24] before the foundation
[2:59:26] of the world and now he's calling a
[2:59:29] bride
[2:59:30] to be of his image of the same genus
[2:59:34] of his sowing kind who he can say
[2:59:37] is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh
