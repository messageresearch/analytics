[42:28] then he a ministers along that line of
[42:31] being thankful he said like the Pilgrim
[42:34] Fathers came to a new land and they were
[42:37] thankful that God had given them that
[42:39] new land and the freedom of it and he

[43:02] Leviticus chapter 17 we're going to read
[43:06] from the eleventh verse I'm sure brother
[43:07] Timothy mentioned communion foot washing
[43:10] next Sunday the first of December and so
[43:15] there'll be two services then and of
[43:19] course you know we have a fellowship
[43:21] dinner together to enjoy and and to be a

[43:31] Lord and ma'am fellowship fellowship

[43:39] good to have each one of you here see
[43:41] brother
[43:41] McNulty back there and God bless you
[43:43] amen
[43:45] years ago spent
[43:46] sometime with his grandparents going
[43:48] back and forth to church together and
[43:51] they hosted me in their homes and and I
[43:52] I don't know if I'm old or you're old
[43:56] but we're something's happening amen but
[43:59] it's good to have you today God bless
[44:01] you take our greetings and love back to
[44:03] your Church in the family um
[44:06] Leviticus 17 and verse 11 for the life
[44:11] of the flesh is in the blood and I have
[44:15] given it to you upon the altar to make
[44:19] an atonement for your souls for it is
[44:23] the blood that maketh an atonement for
[44:27] the Soul and then the Hebrews chapter 9
[44:31] and verse 22
[44:33] let's take us on a New Testament reading
[44:36] here Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 22 and
[44:41] almost all things are by the law purged
[44:44] with blood and without shedding of blood
[44:49] is no remission and that remission of
[44:55] course is forgiveness or pardon or of
[44:58] sins letting them go as if they had
[45:02] never been committed remission of the
[45:05] penalty Amen so without the shedding of
[45:08] blood there is no pardon our forgiveness
[45:11] of sin then back to the Old Testament
[45:14] again to the book of Exodus chapter 12
[45:17] and we will see them leaving the land of
[45:21] Egypt this is verse 21 where that the
[45:24] instructions are given to leave the land
[45:28] of Egypt and go to the promised land and
[45:31] of course this is very applicable to us
[45:34] today as we are also a people leaving
[45:37] the world Egypt and in the world here
[45:43] and and now going in a rapture in a
[45:46] promised land and of Exodus chapter 12
[45:49] verse 21 then Moses called for the
[45:53] elders of Israel and said unto them draw
[45:55] out and take your lamb according your
[45:58] families and kill the power
[45:59] / and you shall take a bunch of hyssop
[46:05] and dip it in the blood that is in the
[46:08] basin and strike the lentil and the two
[46:12] side posts with the blood that is in the
[46:15] basin and none of you shall go out at
[46:18] the door of his house until morning for
[46:22] the Lord will pass through to smite the
[46:25] Egyptians and when he see if the blood
[46:28] upon the lentils and on the two side
[46:31] posts the Lord will pass over the door
[46:35] and will not suffer the destroyer to
[46:38] come in unto your houses to smite you
[46:42] what wonderful words of life this
[46:44] morning Amen god bless you can be seated
[46:48] we're going to be turning for another
[46:50] reading over into revelation 5 and we'll
[46:53] read from there in the thirteenth verse
[46:56] but as you do I want to just make some
[47:00] comments as we are going to be speaking
[47:03] today on the atonement by blood now we
[47:08] have we have returned back to this land
[47:11] and this is what we've been preaching on
[47:14] is the people of the book have returned
[47:16] back to the land of the book and in
[47:20] order to come back to this land it was
[47:23] to bring us back to the original
[47:26] atonement now those are brother
[47:28] branham's words original atonement not a
[47:31] new atonement but the original atonement
[47:34] not a Rekluse affiant of Christ nor is
[47:38] it another blood or another way of
[47:39] approach but it is by the original
[47:43] atonement and so now so we're going to
[47:47] speak this morning on the atonement by
[47:51] blood now the opening of the seals is
[47:55] what we're going to be reading about
[47:57] where the lamb takes the book and I have
[47:59] some things to say about that because in
[48:02] this lamb is where the book of title to
[48:07] the land and to every promise of God is
[48:10] being handed
[48:11] to to the people of God and if you'll
[48:15] notice when in our reading that Christ
[48:18] does this as a man it is a man taking
[48:22] the book is there any man that is worthy
[48:25] so the call came for a worthy man we
[48:30] were singing that song just a moment ago
[48:33] I thought was very appropriate to some
[48:36] of the things that I'm going to speak
[48:37] about this morning worthy is the Lamb
[48:39] that and that has paid the price of
[48:44] redemption
[48:44] now the opening of the seals does not
[48:49] end the atonement work of Christ in fact
[48:54] the taking of the book and the opening
[48:57] of its seals are done by the atoning
[49:00] work of the Lamb
[49:02] so to Tom means to make restitution and
[49:07] so it's actually the lamb atoning that
[49:10] is making restitution taking the book of
[49:13] title that Adam lost and bringing it
[49:17] back into the hands of a man again and
[49:19] by Christ taking it as a man notice he
[49:23] had it as God's not to gods not to Lords
[49:26] he had it as God but he became a man to
[49:29] take it as a man for man and in taking
[49:32] it farm and he done it for all mankind
[49:36] so we can say once again that a man is
[49:42] for in possession of the title of every
[49:45] promise of God of the earth and of man
[49:48] and everything that is inclusive there
[49:51] now so a man is in possession of it now
[49:55] that man is Christ Jesus now of course
[49:58] he doesn't do it for himself he had it
[50:00] as God amen but he did it too and in
[50:06] order to take it for man he became a man
[50:09] in order to redeem it far man to give it
[50:13] back - man this is where that through
[50:16] his atoning work that you actually see
[50:18] in Revelation 10 the book that that John
[50:23] was not worthy to look upon
[50:25] neither to to take on rté much less to
[50:30] look upon he is told to take it and eat
[50:33] it after the atoning work of the lamb or
[50:36] the man Christ Jesus has been done so
[50:39] after Christ took it now then he made us
[50:42] worthy so that we too could be a
[50:46] participant in the inheritance now so
[50:50] again to Tom means to make restitution
[50:52] and that's what the lamb is doing making
[50:55] provisions that the book could be open
[50:59] and then given back to man again now the
[51:03] opening of the book was made possible by
[51:06] the atoning work of the lamb the
[51:09] advancing of the lamb to take the book
[51:12] was not Christ leaving the throne but
[51:15] rather advancing to the throne or else
[51:18] how or else how could he take the book
[51:21] see he had to take the book from the
[51:23] ones sitting on the throne he takes it
[51:26] from God and brings it back to man again
[51:29] this is a whole symbology that is being
[51:32] shown in the book of Revelation
[51:34] so the intercessor by taking the book is
[51:37] not cease in his work of intercessory
[51:40] but rather completing his work for the
[51:44] Gentile bride because the work of
[51:47] redemption continues on and we're going
[51:49] to find out here in a bit how long this
[51:52] work of contention continues because he
[51:56] will continue his work of redemption
[52:00] then as the gospel goes from the
[52:04] Gentiles to the Jews so he's still doing
[52:06] a work of redemption even after the
[52:09] Gentiles have been secured away and
[52:12] raptured and taken taken into glory then
[52:17] he is still doing his redeeming work
[52:20] would you just to see he is still
[52:22] Redeemer taking the book loose and it
[52:25] seals does not cause him to relinquish
[52:28] his atoning work neither does it caused
[52:32] him to relinquish his priesthood because
[52:36] he continues to be
[52:38] the high priest that can be touched by
[52:41] the feelings of our infirmity and
[52:43] continues to be the intercessor between
[52:47] God and man now redemption may be coming
[52:51] to a close or maybe may be coming close
[52:54] to being finished for the Gentiles but
[52:57] redemption is far from over
[53:01] redemption is an ongoing work that
[53:05] continues until the earth itself is
[53:08] redeemed and restored back to his eatin
[53:12] condition again as long as the work the
[53:15] earth is not in its Eden condition now
[53:18] yeah man you may be in your soul but
[53:21] your body's still far from it you're not
[53:24] back in the Eden condition yet the earth
[53:26] itself is not back in the Eden condition
[53:29] and as long as the earth is not in Eden
[53:33] condition he is still Redeemer he is
[53:37] still Savior he is still restore he is
[53:42] still the priest now as we as we look at
[53:47] this when that when the scene of
[53:49] revelation 5 is finished and here we're
[53:52] looking at it right now when the scene
[53:54] of Revelation 5 is finished all creation
[53:58] is worshipping God now that's not to
[54:01] continue the condition that we're in
[54:04] right now creation is groaning
[54:06] travailing and pain your bodies are
[54:09] groaning travailing and pain your
[54:11] sickness sorrow pain death all kinds of
[54:14] things that are happening right now
[54:16] because all creation is struggling and
[54:19] is groaning but there's gonna come a
[54:22] time when all creation will worship God
[54:25] hey ma'am now this this of course is is
[54:30] a time that still lays out in the future
[54:33] now the reason I'm pointing this out is
[54:35] because many people take revelation 5
[54:39] the breach as being a moment in a
[54:42] twinkling and event something that
[54:44] occurred or maybe um in 1963 perhaps
[54:48] he'll want to put a date to it
[54:50] there when the when the seals was open
[54:52] but that is not true because this is a
[54:55] process of redemption it is not a moment
[54:59] twinkling our event event it begins with
[55:02] one sitting on the throne with the book
[55:05] in its hand
[55:06] it shows the scene of redemption of a
[55:08] slain lamb taking the book and it
[55:11] finishes here wherever all creation
[55:14] worships God
[55:16] so you see revelation 5 is not a moment
[55:20] twinkling of an eye event it is a
[55:23] process which has many different steps
[55:27] in its parts of redemption in fact a
[55:30] revelation 5 begins with what begins
[55:33] over in revelation 4 where one is
[55:35] sitting on the throne that's God and
[55:37] then he has a book in his hand he got it
[55:40] back from Adam when Adam fell it had to
[55:43] go back in the hands of Almighty God so
[55:45] you see it's beginning is long before
[55:48] Calvary and it's ending is is even after
[55:52] all the ages is over so if you see every
[55:56] creature which is in heaven and on earth
[55:58] and under the earth and such as are in
[56:01] the sea and all that are in them heard I
[56:03] say in blessing and honor and glory and
[56:06] power be unto him that sitteth upon the
[56:09] throne and unto the lamb for ever and
[56:11] ever and the four beasts said amen and
[56:14] ah and the four and twenty elders fell
[56:16] down and worshiped him that liveth for
[56:20] ever and ever so you can see it begins
[56:23] with a question book and then it also
[56:28] goes right into the Redeemer and his
[56:31] work and it it goes right on until all
[56:35] creation is worshiping God now so now
[56:40] I'm here is a scene of the Redeemer at
[56:43] work let's go to revelation 5 now in
[56:46] verse 1 revelation 5 in verse 1 and I
[56:50] saw in the right hand of him that sat on
[56:52] the throne a book written within and on
[56:56] the backside sealed with seven seals and
[56:59] I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[57:03] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[57:06] the book to loose the seals are of and
[57:10] no man in heaven nor in earth neither
[57:13] under the earth was able to open the
[57:16] book neither to look thereon and I wept
[57:19] much because no man was found worthy to
[57:22] open and to read the book neither to
[57:25] look thereon and one of the elders said
[57:28] unto me
[57:29] we've not behold the Lion of the tribe
[57:32] of Judah the root of David hath
[57:34] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[57:38] the seven seals thereof now notice he he
[57:42] is the Lion of the tribe of Judah hey
[57:46] man he is the line he is the king the
[57:49] king prevailed and the way he prevailed
[57:52] was becoming a lamb they're not two gods
[57:57] here and man this is why it shows in the
[58:00] symbology a lamb and he's got seven
[58:03] hundred seven eyes and I was before him
[58:05] behind and so on like that he he's a
[58:07] very odd looking that Jesus is not a
[58:10] willy lamb he's not a funny-looking
[58:13] creature he's a man but this is
[58:15] symbology or symbolic of his Redemption
[58:19] work where the king becomes the lamb
[58:23] where the lion becomes the lamb let's
[58:28] look at this real close so and I beheld
[58:31] and lo in the midst of the throne and of
[58:34] the four beasts and in the midst of the
[58:36] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[58:40] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[58:43] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[58:46] into all the earth and he came and took
[58:49] the book out of the right hand of him
[58:52] that sat upon the throne and when he had
[58:55] taken the book the four beasts and the
[58:57] four and twenty elders fell down before
[58:59] the lamb having every one of them harps
[59:02] and golden vials full of odours which
[59:05] are the prayers of the saints and they
[59:07] sung a new song saying thou art worthy
[59:10] to take the book and to open the seals
[59:13] are of four that was slain
[59:16] and has redeemed us to God by thy blood
[59:22] notice now redemption is my blood and
[59:26] how does he redeem how does he pay this
[59:30] price is by his own blood a man out of
[59:34] every kindred and tongue and people and
[59:38] nation for that gives us all a chance
[59:41] this is not history Jews and Gentiles
[59:44] this is not for colors and nationalities
[59:47] and men this is for God's people of ever
[59:49] race kindred tongue people aren't you
[59:52] glad to serve a god like that a man
[59:55] notice and he has made us unto our God
[59:59] kings and priests and we shall reign on
[1:00:03] the earth and I held I beheld and I've
[1:00:07] heard the voice of many angels round
[1:00:09] about the throne and the beasts and the
[1:00:11] elders and the number of them was ten
[1:00:13] thousand times ten thousand and
[1:00:16] thousands of thousands saying with a
[1:00:18] loud voice worthy is the Lamb that was
[1:00:21] slain to receive power and riches and
[1:00:24] wisdom and strength and honor and glory
[1:00:27] and blessing and then all of creation
[1:00:31] breaks out into praise amen because once
[1:00:35] that redemption has been finalized and
[1:00:38] the king of the earth that fell is
[1:00:41] restored back to his physician then the
[1:00:44] earth gets restored in fact that's what
[1:00:47] we are seeing in the Millennium is the
[1:00:49] king and the Queen ruling together
[1:00:51] payment for that thousand years created
[1:00:54] and Eden upon the earth it'll be a time
[1:00:57] of the Feast of of Tabernacles
[1:01:00] amen where we were where we will
[1:01:02] remember our journey ins here upon the
[1:01:04] earth notice what he said redeemed by
[1:01:08] that blood notice he is lying
[1:01:12] Abdo de and that is symbolic of his
[1:01:15] kingship but did you notice he did not
[1:01:18] take the book as a king as a king he
[1:01:23] sitting on the throne but he takes it as
[1:01:26] a RAM because that is
[1:01:29] symbolic of his Redemption work a man so
[1:01:33] he does it not as a king but as a lamb
[1:01:36] which is a priest so this is his
[1:01:40] priesthood work and then this is his
[1:01:44] this is his work of redemption that take
[1:01:47] in the book is showing his final work of
[1:01:50] intercession and his final work of
[1:01:53] intercession with the Gentiles is taking
[1:01:58] his bride into a rapture and Matt now as
[1:02:02] long as there's one soul that hasn't
[1:02:04] been redeemed and their name dipped in
[1:02:07] mud are you with me now he is still the
[1:02:11] priest still david assessor still the
[1:02:15] redeemer a man and he does it by his
[1:02:19] blood notice that he does not do it any
[1:02:23] other way is not a redemption by faith
[1:02:26] is not an atonement of faith faith
[1:02:28] cannot make an atonement for you only
[1:02:31] the blood can make an atonement we can
[1:02:34] apply it by faith but it first must be
[1:02:38] the blood applied by faith now but he
[1:02:43] does not take the book as a king but he
[1:02:45] doesn't as the priest are the lamb now
[1:02:50] the tangent of the book is showing his
[1:02:52] final work of redemption and then
[1:02:55] intercession by rapture in his church it
[1:02:58] is all a part of his claiming work it's
[1:03:01] the Lambs work he first prentices us a
[1:03:04] man that's his purchase and work which
[1:03:07] he done at Calvary then he continues
[1:03:09] right honor and and here he has been
[1:03:12] interceding for us through throughout
[1:03:15] all of these years and he's still
[1:03:17] interceding how in the world do you
[1:03:19] think prayers can be can be received you
[1:03:22] see he doesn't stop interceding because
[1:03:26] he starts claiming hey man but no you
[1:03:30] know his purchase and made a way for him
[1:03:33] for his intercession work and his
[1:03:35] intersessional work makes away for his
[1:03:38] claiming work
[1:03:40] the claim of work means to rapture up
[1:03:42] ride out of here now so though the lamb
[1:03:46] is symbolic and it represents his work
[1:03:48] as kinsman redeemer were the king the
[1:03:51] lion became our sacrifice and it is his
[1:03:56] work of kinsmen worrying he takes the
[1:03:59] book and opens it notice he does it as a
[1:04:03] man is there man
[1:04:05] worthy the book represents the redeem
[1:04:09] now you know we get a lot of different
[1:04:10] pictures of this because we fail some
[1:04:13] time to realize that the book of
[1:04:16] Revelation is a symbolic book it's rich
[1:04:19] in symbols and so it's showing a drama
[1:04:23] or a scene and so you know there there's
[1:04:27] really there's really not two God's up
[1:04:30] there one on the throne and one over
[1:04:32] here is a land now that's that's the
[1:04:35] wrong conclusion that's just showing
[1:04:37] what he did the king became the lamb
[1:04:39] amen
[1:04:40] but he doesn't do it as a woolly lamb is
[1:04:43] not a is not a lamb going up with hooves
[1:04:45] and reaching up and with his biet with
[1:04:48] his hooves there and taking this and
[1:04:50] he's a woolly lamb with seven horns and
[1:04:53] seven eyes no that's only symbolic of
[1:04:56] his priesthood and his Redemption work
[1:05:01] now so again the book itself we we
[1:05:06] picture maybe it's a big leather-bound
[1:05:08] book you know it does it have a goat
[1:05:11] skin on the outsider
[1:05:13] does it have you know is that a cow's
[1:05:17] skin is it tan leather or what is this
[1:05:21] book of course you know we think of it
[1:05:24] as a book and it's really a scroll a man
[1:05:27] and it's sealed with seven seals
[1:05:30] but it's nothing it's not a book per se
[1:05:33] it that is symbolic of the people that
[1:05:37] he is redeeming and meant soil reality
[1:05:41] and take in the book he has taken a
[1:05:43] people to himself because the believers
[1:05:46] are the names
[1:05:48] in the book and the book is only
[1:05:51] symbolizing them in this scene as who
[1:05:54] God is redeeming aren't you glad your
[1:05:57] name is in the book
[1:05:59] hey ma'am because that's the book the
[1:06:02] believer now
[1:06:04] so the book represents redeemed and when
[1:06:07] he literally takes that book he that is
[1:06:11] the physical translation of the bride
[1:06:15] Amen now let's just let's just look back
[1:06:19] for a moment in history you know when
[1:06:22] John turned to see a lion he didn't see
[1:06:27] one what did he see he saw a lamb now
[1:06:35] really what we are seeing here is
[1:06:37] Melchizedek priest and King because the
[1:06:42] priest is also King the king is also
[1:06:45] priest and the same God that created the
[1:06:50] heavens and the earth is the same God to
[1:06:52] step down into human flesh and became
[1:06:55] the son or the offspring of his creation
[1:06:57] and God comes and well in his the body
[1:07:01] that he makes not two gods in all not to
[1:07:04] lords one Lord one faith one baptism one
[1:07:08] God one father one creator not many not
[1:07:13] two not three one here o Israel the Lord
[1:07:18] thy God is one Lord but he puts it here
[1:07:22] as a symbol because it's symbolizing his
[1:07:25] work as a man now as John looks to and
[1:07:32] he C turns to see a lion as I said he
[1:07:36] doesn't see a lion he sees a lambeth it
[1:07:39] reminds me of Esther you know Esther was
[1:07:43] afraid to go in to see the king she had
[1:07:47] heard all the stories of if he's not
[1:07:49] pleased with you while you dive you
[1:07:51] interrupt his business he can judge you
[1:07:54] and send you to death you know I it was
[1:07:56] very very fearsome to her fearful to her
[1:07:59] for her to go in to see the king
[1:08:02] but you know she heard all her all her
[1:08:05] life about this king and how how angry
[1:08:10] he could be at being been disrupted in
[1:08:14] his business and how anybody who come in
[1:08:17] without without permission and
[1:08:19] interrupted his court would be sent to
[1:08:21] death and she worried and worried and
[1:08:23] worried and was reluctant to go before
[1:08:25] the king but when she went before the
[1:08:29] king she didn't see a king she didn't
[1:08:33] see this lion she saw a lamb and the
[1:08:38] lamb said answer here's my Ceptor
[1:08:41] and you're welcome in my presence I'm
[1:08:44] here here it is come on in what do you
[1:08:48] want even half the kingdom a man in
[1:08:52] other words you're Aaron join there with
[1:08:54] me so when she approached the throne she
[1:08:59] never saw a lion she saw a lamb Oh God
[1:09:04] isn't that wonderful for you today to
[1:09:08] know is that the Bride of Christ you do
[1:09:10] never see the judgment side of God you
[1:09:14] never see his anger you never see us
[1:09:17] wrath you've never seen his judgments
[1:09:20] but when you come into his presence you
[1:09:23] see a lamb hallelujah lamb that says
[1:09:28] welcome come on in I'll give you half
[1:09:31] the kingdom I share with you all that I
[1:09:33] got all that I have is yours what a
[1:09:37] wonderful thing to know that we can
[1:09:41] approach him as a lamb a man now I'm
[1:09:47] gonna read a quotation that that causes
[1:09:51] sometimes a lot of a lot of people to
[1:09:54] get confused because again they want to
[1:09:57] make all of this a moment twinkling of
[1:09:59] our event and as I've showed you in the
[1:10:01] scripture in Revelation 5 is not a
[1:10:04] moment twinkling eye event it is a
[1:10:09] process of redemption
[1:10:14] and so brother branham would tell us in
[1:10:16] the breach he said he leaves the throne
[1:10:18] of intercessor as a slain lamb to be a
[1:10:22] lion king to bring the world to judgment
[1:10:24] who has rejected his message he's not a
[1:10:27] mediator remember the Old Testament
[1:10:30] teaching now as we hurry when the blood
[1:10:32] went off the mercy seat what was it
[1:10:35] judgment seat and when the lamb slain
[1:10:38] walk forward from eternity out of the
[1:10:41] Father's throne and took his rights
[1:10:43] it was a judgment seat then he become
[1:10:46] not a lamb but a lion king and he calls
[1:10:50] for his Queen to come stand by his side
[1:10:52] know ye not the Saints shall judge the
[1:10:56] earth now I wanted to say to you we are
[1:11:00] in the process of fulfillment as he says
[1:11:06] he leads the throne of to be an
[1:11:08] innocence Lane lamb to be a lion king to
[1:11:12] the bring the world to judgment who has
[1:11:15] rejected his message he is not a
[1:11:17] mediator now let me just say it I'm flat
[1:11:19] that hadn't happened yet
[1:11:23] amen although we're in the process of
[1:11:25] its fulfillment it hadn't happened yet
[1:11:28] but the world will be judged and plagued
[1:11:32] and Satan will be bound a thousand years
[1:11:36] it will happen
[1:11:38] he is coming King he's not King yet
[1:11:42] ix king of saints but he's not king of
[1:11:46] this world Jesus even would have to give
[1:11:49] place and Satan turns as say of Satan
[1:11:52] he's the prince of this world you will
[1:11:54] see in the tribulation he will reign for
[1:11:58] a short time during the tribulation be
[1:12:01] flow as brother Branham calls him full
[1:12:03] king of the earth right now Jesus is not
[1:12:07] the king of the earth that's why you
[1:12:10] know we cannot blame Jesus for all the
[1:12:12] crippled children the blind eyes the old
[1:12:15] people that are dying and sickness and
[1:12:17] disease and war and strife because Jesus
[1:12:20] is not the king
[1:12:23] a man if he were king then he would be
[1:12:25] responsible for what's going on in his
[1:12:27] kingdom when Jesus comes King there'll
[1:12:30] be no more sorrow no more pain no more
[1:12:34] death no more crippled children no more
[1:12:38] evil no more sin somebody help me preach
[1:12:41] when he is King he'll take control over
[1:12:44] the earth when it becomes King on your
[1:12:47] heart he there's no more sin there's
[1:12:49] little more wickedness there's no more
[1:12:52] evil in your life come on somebody
[1:12:53] because he became the king in your life
[1:12:56] when he becomes king of the earth and
[1:12:59] man Satan's reign will be over because
[1:13:02] he'll be found a thousand years he'll
[1:13:05] take him around and grab him by the neck
[1:13:07] and sew him into a pit and chain him
[1:13:09] with circumstances and there there will
[1:13:13] be a time of a freedom of millennial
[1:13:16] peace of all the earth but right now
[1:13:19] peace is gone from the earth
[1:13:22] why because Satan is the Prince of the
[1:13:25] power of this atmosphere amen
[1:13:29] but the world will be judged and plagued
[1:13:32] and Satan will be bound a thousand years
[1:13:36] the horror the false church will be
[1:13:39] judged and burnt but before she is a
[1:13:43] people is called out let's let's look
[1:13:46] over here revelation 18 and verse 1 and
[1:13:49] after these things I saw another angel
[1:13:52] come down from heaven having great power
[1:13:54] and the earth was lightened with his
[1:13:57] glory and he cried mightily with a
[1:13:59] strong voice saying Babylon the Great is
[1:14:03] fallen is fallen and has become the
[1:14:05] habitation of devils and the hold of
[1:14:08] every foul spirit and a cage of every
[1:14:11] unclean and hateful bird for all the
[1:14:14] nations have drunk of the wine of the
[1:14:16] wrath of her fornication and the kings
[1:14:18] of the earth have committed fornication
[1:14:20] with her and the merchants of the earth
[1:14:23] are waxed rich through the abundance of
[1:14:26] her delicacies and I heard another voice
[1:14:28] from heaven saying come out of her my
[1:14:31] people that you be not partakers of her
[1:14:35] sins that
[1:14:35] receive not of her plagues so look
[1:14:39] before she's pled got those of people
[1:14:42] out hey man
[1:14:44] now listen Church he has called the
[1:14:46] people out but he's calling the people
[1:14:48] out he is still presently today calling
[1:14:52] a people out he is presently today
[1:14:57] calling for a queen to come stand by his
[1:15:00] side
[1:15:01] hey man hey man it's all in the process
[1:15:05] don't put a period to it I'm not because
[1:15:09] I'll tell you many of you if a period
[1:15:11] was put where they wanted to put it many
[1:15:13] years ago anybody born after a certain
[1:15:15] year couldn't make it in because men
[1:15:19] have tried to be to play God and will it
[1:15:23] bring an end to Redemption and close the
[1:15:26] door on all the others and laugh and
[1:15:29] make fun you know those that are on the
[1:15:31] outside let me tell you friends that
[1:15:33] ain't Christ a man that ain't the sphere
[1:15:37] of Christ that is not the bride the
[1:15:39] spirit and the bride say come and
[1:15:41] whoever's thirsty come and drink of the
[1:15:44] water of life freely
[1:15:46] hey man but I heard another voice and
[1:15:50] verse five said her sins like Sodom have
[1:15:54] reached to heaven and God has remembered
[1:15:56] her iniquity now listen brother branham
[1:15:59] explains us this angel is the last
[1:16:03] messenger before the coming of Christ in
[1:16:06] Revelation 19 chapter of Revelation the
[1:16:11] messengers voice if we notice when he
[1:16:14] gave his voice on earth there was a
[1:16:16] voice echoed again in heaven fourth
[1:16:18] verse if you wanna read it
[1:16:19] alright fourth verse the 19th chapter
[1:16:21] this messenger on the earth was so
[1:16:24] inclined with God when he spoke it on
[1:16:28] the earth God echoed it from heaven and
[1:16:31] he said what is the fourth tense
[1:16:34] translation Bert's translation what does
[1:16:37] it mean God's voice speaking to his
[1:16:40] predestinated people saying come out of
[1:16:43] her just exactly what the voice was he
[1:16:46] got it people all out there
[1:16:48] out through Babel and come out of her
[1:16:49] that you be not partakers of her sins
[1:16:51] yes sir
[1:16:52] out of that dogma and creeds to the Word
[1:16:54] made spirited life a man
[1:16:57] notice the 19 top chapters the next
[1:17:00] after these things
[1:17:02] did you notice here the 19 chapter after
[1:17:05] these things what what after what after
[1:17:07] the message of come out of her after
[1:17:10] these things is the shout of the bride
[1:17:13] Saints with the bridegroom going to the
[1:17:15] marriage of the Lamb how close are we
[1:17:17] then brothers hey man how close are we
[1:17:21] then we've heard the call this has come
[1:17:23] out of her that's why you're here this
[1:17:26] Lord you heard that call come out of
[1:17:29] Babylon come out of the confusion come

[1:17:37] word get back to the homeland what was
[1:17:40] that a of Schauder a trumpet sound and
[1:17:43] then a voice ringing now calling his
[1:17:46] elect back to the homeland again now
[1:17:51] that is still going out today as we
[1:17:55] prophesy again it still rings out it's
[1:18:01] still going out it's going out from this
[1:18:02] church it's going to out from every
[1:18:05] believer across the world come out of
[1:18:07] her my people it's streaming out to your
[1:18:10] heart today come out of the lukewarmness

[1:18:16] into Christ get in there the plagues are
[1:18:18] coming don't be in just a little cold
[1:18:21] church member you know just don't just
[1:18:23] be content to sit on even a message to
[1:18:26] you get into Christ get it without your
[1:18:29] heart put everything you got into it
[1:18:33] this call is still going out but he let
[1:18:37] me say it again he has not yet become
[1:18:40] king of the earth he will do this in the
[1:18:45] millennial reign now let me just read it
[1:18:51] again when the blood went off the mercy
[1:18:53] seat what was it remember this whole
[1:18:55] thing a revelation vibe is a process not
[1:18:59] a moment in a twinkling of Iban it's
[1:19:02] showing the scene of redemption
[1:19:05] now when the lamb slain walked forth
[1:19:09] forward from eternity out of the
[1:19:12] Father's throne and took his rights
[1:19:13] it was a judgment seat then he he become
[1:19:18] not a lamb but a lion king and he calls
[1:19:21] for his Queen to come stand by side know
[1:19:25] ye not to say to judge the earth now
[1:19:28] first of all let's look at this the
[1:19:30] throne is not yet a judgement seat it is
[1:19:35] still a seat of mercy and it will be
[1:19:39] until every name that is on the book has
[1:19:44] been clams by blood hey Mack now in
[1:19:51] trying to do God a service with that it
[1:19:54] be as this wheel this is a Jeff sermon
[1:19:56] in in 65 when the brother branham's last
[1:20:00] sermons when then in them days they only
[1:20:03] had one meeting place that could meet
[1:20:05] God and that was at the ark under the
[1:20:07] blood and that's the only meeting place
[1:20:10] yet see it's unchanged remember it's not
[1:20:16] making a new atonement man and a new
[1:20:20] atonement won't be made for Israel
[1:20:22] either it's gonna get them to recognize
[1:20:25] the atonement and again this is not a
[1:20:29] new atonement that God brings us to but
[1:20:32] it is us recognizing what was in the
[1:20:36] atonement hey man if you could recognize
[1:20:39] it this morning
[1:20:40] there wouldn't be a sick person left a
[1:20:42] man we would all be healed and delivered
[1:20:45] and saved and a man if we could just
[1:20:47] recognize what's in the atonement it's
[1:20:50] paid for you don't have to work for it
[1:20:53] you don't have to labor again and man
[1:20:56] it's all paid for it's in the atonement
[1:20:59] the price has been paid you ought to
[1:21:02] look at your adversary the devil is
[1:21:04] shake your finger in his face and say
[1:21:06] the price for my healing the price
[1:21:10] my family the price has all been paid
[1:21:13] it's been paid with blood a man with the
[1:21:19] blood of God Himself seen it now take
[1:21:25] your hands off of what belongs to me
[1:21:28] amen that's the only meeting place yet
[1:21:35] under the blood mercy seat was sprinkled
[1:21:38] to give mercy to the worshiper or they
[1:21:41] asked her when he came to ask the
[1:21:43] petition of God and God had a special
[1:21:46] routine the way you had to go about it
[1:21:48] he wouldn't accept anything else he
[1:21:50] wouldn't accept any other provision just
[1:21:52] the way he fixed and then he continues
[1:21:55] to go on to explain as brother Branham
[1:21:57] would call even in another sermon that
[1:22:00] Jesus is God's mercy seat and how that
[1:22:03] Jesus is God's chosen place of worship
[1:22:07] and under his shed blood is the only
[1:22:11] place that we can worship now God made
[1:22:16] sure that we would understand the
[1:22:18] provisions from her mercy from the mercy
[1:22:22] seat his endtime messenger to us would
[1:22:26] preach to us and said a God who is rich
[1:22:29] in mercy I want to submit to you the
[1:22:33] opening of the seals did not take away
[1:22:36] mercy it gave a grain of mercy and man
[1:22:41] they revealed a God rich in mercy he
[1:22:44] would preach a sermon called pardon oh
[1:22:47] man well if there's no one on the mercy
[1:22:50] seat you can't get pardoned but if you
[1:22:53] got a merciful God who is still in the
[1:22:55] saving business man come on then you can
[1:22:59] be pardoned but you gotta believe that
[1:23:02] he is not that he was because if you
[1:23:05] believe he was an audience today then
[1:23:07] you can never get a pardon now brother
[1:23:15] Branham would tell us he said but you
[1:23:17] see in this book what was redeemed it
[1:23:21] was a book of
[1:23:23] and everything that he had redeemed was
[1:23:25] written in that book all he died for was
[1:23:29] written in the book and he could not
[1:23:31] believe his minute oriole seat until he
[1:23:35] had surly redeemed and he couldn't
[1:23:39] redeem it at the cross because they were
[1:23:41] predestinated here on the Lamb's Book of
[1:23:44] Life and he had to stay on there to make
[1:23:46] intercession until that last person was
[1:23:49] finished glory amen
[1:23:54] Oh aren't you glad aren't you glad
[1:23:57] friends it reached down to you amen
[1:24:00] brother Jared just a few weeks ago
[1:24:02] months ago now what happened mercy came
[1:24:05] rewrote your life and then he could not
[1:24:08] come until you came in and then now
[1:24:12] we're still looking for the next one
[1:24:14] whose name is in the book of life and
[1:24:17] then the bride is saying whosoever will
[1:24:21] her man and you might have been a
[1:24:23] believer of sorts and the sympathizer
[1:24:25] with the message for years and years and
[1:24:28] you've language out there in the world
[1:24:30] and over all for years and years and
[1:24:32] years but I'll tell you God is not just
[1:24:35] a God of one chance he's a God of second
[1:24:38] chances and third chances for taxes he's
[1:24:42] a God who is Richard Matt Sitton
[1:24:44] we will not give up he'll stay there no
[1:24:53] matter how many preachers have put him
[1:24:54] off he'll stay there until that last one
[1:25:02] amen amen I don't know when it's gonna
[1:25:05] happen then it turns to a judgement seat
[1:25:07] but it happened yet because I still see
[1:25:11] mercy
[1:25:12] I still see the high priests at work man
[1:25:16] I still see them heal I still see him
[1:25:19] deliver I still seemed set free
[1:25:22] come oh I still seem liberate souls so I
[1:25:25] know he's still the high priest now
[1:25:31] brother branham would preach sermons
[1:25:33] like the unveiling of God and the mighty
[1:25:37] God and veiled Ana and he would tell us
[1:25:41] that the unveiling of God would reveal
[1:25:44] the true mercy seat now what it did like
[1:25:49] in the days of Israel if it rid the veil
[1:25:53] of traditions and so there was no God
[1:25:55] there in in Pharisee ISM and Judaism
[1:25:58] that there was not nothing there it was
[1:26:01] just empty
[1:26:02] are you with me and when God does the
[1:26:05] same thing in this end time here in
[1:26:07] surveillant radition and shows that
[1:26:09] there's no God there that there's
[1:26:11] nothing that will rapture a church in
[1:26:14] denominational traditions a man but but
[1:26:19] it doesn't say it doesn't remove the
[1:26:21] mercies of God in fact it shows a
[1:26:24] greater mercy scene and we have a
[1:26:27] greater mercy seat like insel did
[1:26:30] greater than the woolly lamb and we have
[1:26:33] a greater mercy seat than even the
[1:26:35] justification or segregation or gifts of
[1:26:38] the Spirit and seats of mercy that was
[1:26:40] in denominations we've got a greater
[1:26:42] mercy see with not less mercy but my
[1:26:47] mercy
[1:26:49] in fact the opening of the seals did it
[1:26:53] give us more mercy or less well look at
[1:26:56] it it showed there's a bride in the
[1:26:58] rapture but that's not all a multitude
[1:27:01] without number saved in the tribulation
[1:27:04] that's a god rich in mercy 144,000 Jews
[1:27:08] and man even souls under the altar they
[1:27:14] didn't even have the testimony of Jesus
[1:27:16] and are given white robes
[1:27:21] merci merci
[1:27:24] and we found that there was a God with
[1:27:27] more mercy than what we ever imagined
[1:27:30] when we thought it was all about house
[1:27:33] and it was all about him and his
[1:27:36] redeeming plan that he had a bride and
[1:27:39] then he had a church and then he had a
[1:27:40] foolish virgin are you with me and then
[1:27:43] yeah they got on in 44,000 and he had he
[1:27:46] had their souls on the yellow we had a
[1:27:48] ball and they were all their names were
[1:27:50] in his book and when he opens it
[1:27:54] he shows there's mercy for all and the
[1:28:00] unveiling of God showed us a mercy seat
[1:28:04] not what's in denomination but the
[1:28:07] original mercy seat the original
[1:28:12] atonement now yes they had parts and
[1:28:18] those parts get them into the
[1:28:21] tribulation some of them go into life
[1:28:25] but friends with the full mercy seat
[1:28:28] come in view you get a rapture that's a
[1:28:32] god rich in mercy are you with me now
[1:28:36] now so you see when the veil of
[1:28:41] traditions are taken away then the mercy
[1:28:44] seat comes into plain view yes it shows
[1:28:49] the impetus of forms and dogmas and
[1:28:53] man's religions but at the same time it
[1:28:56] would show beyond the veil of traditions
[1:29:00] of Judaism was the lamb slain and the
[1:29:05] same thing happens for us in our day
[1:29:08] when the when the when God wasn't veiled
[1:29:11] before us when the mighty God unveiled
[1:29:14] himself to this generation he showed the
[1:29:18] emptiness they met the emptiness of all
[1:29:23] the forms of religion but he showed Arup
[1:29:27] own for the bride there he his mercy
[1:29:31] seat
[1:29:32] a man in fact of the matter the the
[1:29:35] mercy-seat is advancing to take the book
[1:29:39] of redemption and to finish what was
[1:29:41] started at Calvary this is awesome
[1:29:45] Church and man now so he says so again
[1:29:51] he said now the veil was written at
[1:29:53] Calvary the mercy seat came in the plain
[1:29:56] view but what happened it was hanging on
[1:29:58] Calvary dripping in blood in the
[1:30:01] unveiling of God he said God wanted to
[1:30:03] show them the mercy seat God want to
[1:30:06] show them who he was
[1:30:07] so the veil in the temple from the hand
[1:30:10] of God above was rent from top to bottom
[1:30:12] and should God in plain view it was
[1:30:15] Jesus Christ hanging on the cross the
[1:30:18] mercy seat the man you said where
[1:30:21] there's no more mercy seat then there's
[1:30:23] no more Jesus because he is the mercy
[1:30:27] seat the mercy seat ain't a piece of
[1:30:30] furniture the mercy seat is a person
[1:30:33] somebody help me breathe and that person
[1:30:36] is Jesus Christ He is God see the mercy
[1:30:39] and then the book is not a leather-bound
[1:30:43] book the book is of people the lamb is a
[1:30:47] person the mercy seat is Jesus and if
[1:30:53] you ever get a view of Jesus or my man
[1:30:57] if you ever get him come and plain view
[1:30:59] and men right now on this side of
[1:31:02] eternity you're gonna see a lamb a man
[1:31:06] who says coming to me all ye that are
[1:31:08] heavy laden I'll give you rest take your
[1:31:13] yoke upon me it's easy and my burdens
[1:31:16] are light what a mighty God were servant
[1:31:20] what a God rich in mercy now he said it
[1:31:25] was Jesus hanging on the cross the mercy
[1:31:28] seat what was it the people were too
[1:31:30] blind to see it and it's repeated again
[1:31:34] their traditions how then the day of
[1:31:38] Pentecost the word came and was in the
[1:31:40] form of son of God they began to
[1:31:43] organize it at Nicaea Roman
[1:31:45] first day they went to Methodist Baptist
[1:31:47] Presbyterian Pentecostals so forth and
[1:31:50] it organized tradition till a man don't
[1:31:53] know where he stands
[1:31:54] but Gorda God he promised in the last
[1:31:57] days what he would do he would show his
[1:31:59] word in plain view
[1:32:01] what word the word of his mercy let me
[1:32:06] ask you what in word you think the
[1:32:08] rapture is it's the word of his mercy
[1:32:11] it's the word of great grace
[1:32:13] it's a cat's tongue come and crime grace
[1:32:16] grace to finish everything off a god
[1:32:21] rich in mercy this is what brother
[1:32:26] Branham was asked the question his mercy
[1:32:29] over he said hope mercy goodness don't
[1:32:31] you ever think that you'll have to go
[1:32:37] against the words of the prophet of God
[1:32:39] himself to think mercy is over our mercy
[1:32:43] is only in your corner mercy is not in
[1:32:46] your corner mercies in Christ and me and
[1:32:52] you may think you got all of Jesus but
[1:32:55] it's more important that he's got all of
[1:32:57] you hey man now notice he would show his
[1:33:07] word in plain view open before us again
[1:33:10] open it up then and only then he calls
[1:33:13] for his Queen to come stand by his side
[1:33:17] now let me just read that in context
[1:33:19] again and one the lamb slain walk
[1:33:22] forward from eternity out of the
[1:33:24] Father's throne and took his rights
[1:33:26] it was a judgment seat then he becomes
[1:33:30] not a lamb but a lion king and he calls
[1:33:32] for his Queen to come by his sides come
[1:33:36] stand by his side know ye not this
[1:33:39] Saints shall judge the earth now has
[1:33:43] this happened has he called his Queen to
[1:33:48] come stand by side now it's in the works
[1:33:53] it's in the plan but I agree with what
[1:33:57] you were saying it hadn't happened hey
[1:34:01] man nah notice he will not become King
[1:34:05] until he rains his son of David are you
[1:34:09] with me now this is he where he comes in
[1:34:12] his three sons name he comes as a
[1:34:14] prophet priest and King son of man son
[1:34:17] of God son of David and now he won't
[1:34:20] become King until the millennial reign
[1:34:23] and he has not come he has not come as
[1:34:28] revelation 19 so while the word has come
[1:34:32] and that's him on the white horse
[1:34:34] brother branham never applied that there
[1:34:35] he always applied that in the future so
[1:34:38] stay with what the prophet said a man he
[1:34:41] will come to reign as king of kings and
[1:34:44] Lord of lords and when he does will be
[1:34:47] the Battle of Armageddon and then the
[1:34:49] destruction of the enemy and Satan will
[1:34:51] be bound and then he will reign with his
[1:34:53] bride any man but he create on that
[1:34:58] what's the term he calls for his Queen
[1:35:00] to come stand by his side now it can't
[1:35:04] happen now listen his queen who is his
[1:35:07] queen first let's define who is his
[1:35:11] queen is this Queen only the living
[1:35:12] bride what about those who just went on
[1:35:18] before us are they not his queen
[1:35:25] somebody help me preach now I'm making a
[1:35:29] point a man think about it now what
[1:35:33] about some of those what about brother
[1:35:35] Jerry shawl that we just laid as a seed
[1:35:38] in a garden was he not his queen well
[1:35:45] what about brother Branham was he not a
[1:35:48] part of the bride let's go back what
[1:35:51] about Daddy Bosworth Smith Wigglesworth
[1:35:54] John G Lake
[1:35:56] John Wesley Martin Luther what about
[1:35:59] Paul
[1:36:02] now when all of that his queen so for
[1:36:05] him to call for his queen to come stand
[1:36:08] by his side means for there to be a
[1:36:11] resurrection of the dead and a rapture
[1:36:14] of the church that substan by his side
[1:36:18] so what well spiritually okay but
[1:36:20] spiritually jeri-show did spiritually
[1:36:23] William Branham dead spiritually John G
[1:36:28] Lake did
[1:36:29] Spira spiritually John Wesley did
[1:36:38] everyone took his side stood by his side
[1:36:44] so he has not called for his queen
[1:36:48] yet spiritually brother Taylor okay but
[1:36:52] friends let's realize this how far in
[1:36:55] the world are you gonna go with all this
[1:36:57] spiritual stuff when we spiritualize it
[1:37:00] and we do away with actually what the
[1:37:03] prophets talking about he is not talking
[1:37:05] about a spiritual application he said
[1:37:08] the Queen and the Queen is of seven ages
[1:37:11] and when that queen is called to stand
[1:37:13] by side there's a resurrection and when
[1:37:17] the resurrection takes place in a
[1:37:19] rapture takes place then he begins and
[1:37:22] turns from from the from priests to
[1:37:26] judge and never another Gentile will be
[1:37:29] saved but then he'll continue his
[1:37:31] priesthood with the Jews so now his
[1:37:41] queen is a seven ages both the living
[1:37:44] and the dead in Christ this is a
[1:37:47] resurrection in the rapture it is the
[1:37:50] trumpet call which in watch those words
[1:37:52] the trumpet call saying come up hither
[1:37:55] in the meantime in the meantime in other
[1:38:02] words before the rapture takes place in
[1:38:04] his promised resurrection he is still
[1:38:07] the land and as well he has filled the
[1:38:12] high priests that
[1:38:13] is his work of lamb now again when we
[1:38:20] talk about symbology in the Bible you
[1:38:23] have the Eagle is symbolic of his
[1:38:26] prophetic office the lion is symbolic of
[1:38:30] his kingship and the lamb is symbolic of
[1:38:34] his priesthood so it's prophet priest
[1:38:35] and King now looking at this brother
[1:38:41] branham would tell us in god's chosen
[1:38:43] place of worship about you know he
[1:38:47] decided how he would save man now
[1:38:49] remember we're coming back to the
[1:38:51] original atonement the two prophets of
[1:38:55] revelation 11 do not introduce them a
[1:38:59] new atonement the inner knee they
[1:39:02] introduce to them to the original attune
[1:39:06] Jesus death at Calvary we'll read about
[1:39:09] it if I have time but now the same thing
[1:39:13] happens with the prophet of Malachi 4
[1:39:15] under the seventh seal message if it
[1:39:19] does not introduce us to a new atonement
[1:39:22] but back to the original atonement and
[1:39:25] the original Tolman was black not my
[1:39:31] blood not your blood that wouldn't work
[1:39:33] amen but God's own blood now of course
[1:39:38] he would use blood until the man could
[1:39:42] come the blood of animals an innocent
[1:39:44] animal until the man could come but once
[1:39:46] a man came no blood of any animal will
[1:39:49] will work as a sacrifice it will not
[1:39:52] atone and it would only atone in part
[1:39:55] because those who would die under that
[1:39:58] blood of animals would go to place
[1:40:01] called Paradise which Jesus would pay
[1:40:03] the price of redemption and empty a man
[1:40:07] because it would take the blood of
[1:40:10] Christ to bring forth full Redemption
[1:40:12] now in God's chosen place of worship
[1:40:16] brother Branham said he decided how he
[1:40:18] would save man we've tried to day to
[1:40:20] educate man into it we tried to school
[1:40:23] them we try to educate them tried to
[1:40:24] denominator add to do these other kind
[1:40:27] of
[1:40:27] bring them in shake them in baptize them
[1:40:29] in and ever other way there is bring
[1:40:32] them in by letters but still remains the
[1:40:35] same God meets man under the shed blood
[1:40:40] of the Lamb
[1:40:42] blood was God's Way in the beginning and
[1:40:45] bloody is God's Way tonight it is good
[1:40:51] to dependents and all these things but
[1:40:53] salvation only comes through bad blood
[1:40:57] is the only way God chose to save man
[1:41:00] and he cannot change it Jobe had the
[1:41:04] same thing he knew that he was righteous
[1:41:06] because he had offered the sacrifice God
[1:41:08] required of him
[1:41:10] so now God's chosen place of worship as
[1:41:14] we know is not in a church it's not even
[1:41:19] in a movement it's not even in a certain
[1:41:22] doctor God's chosen place of worship is
[1:41:26] in Christ now again it's the place where
[1:41:32] the body is
[1:41:33] now as brother Branham would say now
[1:41:35] look at another type we're along here
[1:41:37] the type of the Passover for foreshadow
[1:41:40] Jesus we notice here the sacrifice of
[1:41:43] blood by death the sacrifice of blood
[1:41:45] was a place that foreshadowed Christ can
[1:41:49] a denomination bleed can you think of a
[1:41:52] church bleeding a denominational beat
[1:41:55] bleeding certainly not had taken the
[1:41:57] blood to bleed from a life and the life
[1:42:01] here Jesus comes in view by the lamb the
[1:42:06] lamb was a type of Christ for shattered
[1:42:08] Christ because he was the Lamb of God
[1:42:10] that John introduced that takes away the
[1:42:12] sin of the world and we find Jesus come
[1:42:14] into view here in accidents as well
[1:42:17] chapter notice it was the only place
[1:42:20] death could not strike get this and get
[1:42:25] this because it's important there is a
[1:42:26] place of mercy but there's also a place
[1:42:30] of judgment outside of that mercy is
[1:42:33] judgment now when death was about to
[1:42:36] strike the land there had to be a
[1:42:38] certain place
[1:42:40] Oh from under this died only one place
[1:42:44] now I didn't mean it was one house but
[1:42:46] it was one place and that's where the
[1:42:47] lamb was killed where the Lambs blood
[1:42:50] was the death angel could not strike
[1:42:53] because it was the place God put his
[1:42:57] name and that lament was named back
[1:43:00] there in the beginning the lamb and
[1:43:02] notice it's in the one place he could
[1:43:05] not strike and now that's the same it is
[1:43:10] today notice if he brings us right over
[1:43:14] to today what is required today there's
[1:43:19] only one place that spiritual death
[1:43:21] cannot strike that's the word death
[1:43:25] cannot strike the word because it's the
[1:43:28] Living Word of God but you and you put
[1:43:30] Creed's with it the word moves out to
[1:43:32] itself it'll separate like water from
[1:43:34] oil you cannot mix it together therefore
[1:43:37] you see when the Creed's come down and
[1:43:39] comes into the denomination they all go
[1:43:41] into after the Creed and the word dies
[1:43:43] out and goes on with somebody else and
[1:43:46] increases it more picks up the momentum
[1:43:48] and as it goes from justification
[1:43:50] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[1:43:52] and on out into the grains you see the
[1:43:54] path God has trod bring in his name all
[1:43:57] the time write down the same because he
[1:44:00] is the word notice it cannot die the
[1:44:03] word of life cannot die notice how
[1:44:05] perfect the death angel was not
[1:44:07] forbidden to strike egypt's great
[1:44:10] intellectual people
[1:44:12] it wasn't forbidden to strike its sacred
[1:44:16] lines or its great buildings or its
[1:44:20] pharaohs or its priests of the land the
[1:44:23] angel was not forbidden to striking to
[1:44:25] strike any building any place anybody
[1:44:27] but it could not strike where the lamb
[1:44:31] was death cannot strike where this
[1:44:36] provided place of God is and that's in
[1:44:38] the lamb notice now if he's no longer
[1:44:42] lamb you have no place of grace you have
[1:44:48] no place of safety because only where
[1:44:51] the lamb be
[1:44:54] zoella brother Tim he's not lamb anymore
[1:44:57] he's just only lion well then there's no
[1:44:59] more grace you have no place of mercy
[1:45:03] and you miss the rapture sorry because
[1:45:06] there's no mercy
[1:45:08] the mercy that the rapture itself has a
[1:45:11] judgment of sorts he takes one and
[1:45:14] leaves one church wherever you are what
[1:45:20] you belong to makes me delivered but
[1:45:22] there's one thing you must know you've
[1:45:24] got to be in Christ or you're dead
[1:45:27] and you remember what he said it's the
[1:45:30] lamb you've got to be under the lamb and
[1:45:34] the Lambs blood or you're dead you can't
[1:45:38] live outside of him your church might be
[1:45:41] alright as a building your fellowship
[1:45:42] might be alright as a man but when you
[1:45:45] did not what's now this is very crucial
[1:45:47] when you denied the body the blood the
[1:45:51] word of Jesus Christ you're dead the
[1:45:55] minute you do it
[1:45:59] it is God's chosen place of worship I
[1:46:03] mean there's where you put his name
[1:46:07] there's where his name is exactly
[1:46:08] there's where he chose it but his name
[1:46:10] not in the church but in the son Jesus
[1:46:12] Christ
[1:46:14] notice safety laid lied only in the
[1:46:18] place of his choosing in his lamb and in
[1:46:21] the name of his the lamb notice it was a
[1:46:24] male lamb machine not a her not a church
[1:46:27] she but his name now you know we got
[1:46:34] people today what a hood but mercy in in
[1:46:38] the bride that she sees the seed of
[1:46:41] mercy his name is not in see it's in him
[1:46:48] Amen listen you cannot come under the
[1:46:52] spirit of this age and take the job of
[1:46:55] the man and put it on the Wellman amend
[1:46:59] them the woman though are you with me
[1:47:02] now the bride
[1:47:03] take the lamps face we will never you
[1:47:06] can never hand intercessory tomorrow man
[1:47:12] intercessor between God and man is the
[1:47:14] man Christ Jesus and so you get to you
[1:47:21] try to get the bride doing the husband's
[1:47:23] work not sure she is his body up on the
[1:47:27] earth and when she prays God intercedes
[1:47:29] Christ intercedes a man were his body I
[1:47:33] just struck me you know as I read this
[1:47:35] quote today about how important prayer
[1:47:38] yes you know sometimes we don't see the
[1:47:41] importance of it there's thousands and
[1:47:43] millions of needs and God opened your
[1:47:47] eyes to needs upon the earth as a part
[1:47:50] of his body amen you see the needs of
[1:47:54] your brother your sister you take him
[1:47:56] before God and you pray and then what
[1:47:59] are you doing you're you're bringing
[1:48:01] them to the attention of the Lord amen
[1:48:04] you're interceding on their behalf but
[1:48:07] that does not that does not negate or
[1:48:10] take away from his intercession now
[1:48:16] because over and again after the seals
[1:48:20] will open brother brems let's see how
[1:48:23] sure is he still the high priest and he
[1:48:26] can still be touched he would preach a
[1:48:29] sermon
[1:48:29] who is this Melchizedek and a free would
[1:48:33] get through printer who is that smell
[1:48:35] cousin my cousin dick is among us he
[1:48:38] said okay then you can touch him
[1:48:41] nobody touching me notice notice not by
[1:48:46] touching me I'm not the intercessor but
[1:48:50] by touching him ain't it wonderful this
[1:48:57] morning you don't have to come through a
[1:48:59] preacher to touch him
[1:49:01] you don't have to come to a pope or a
[1:49:04] bishop to touch him I bet you can touch
[1:49:08] the high priests
[1:49:10] Oh ma'am all you gotta do is press
[1:49:12] through the crowd get down humble that's
[1:49:16] the hem of His garment strip lay down
[1:49:19] hot yourself down and touch the hem of
[1:49:22] His garment and you told him tell you to
[1:49:25] permit you to be released back to your
[1:49:28] knee no Pope no bishop no in between no
[1:49:37] preacher Amen it's you in Jesus but men
[1:49:46] want to have power today in their hands
[1:49:48] to forgive sins and hold back sins and
[1:49:52] whatever else we got to power yeah we do
[1:49:56] the church whatever we bind on earth is
[1:49:59] bound in heaven but how do we release
[1:50:01] sins by getting them to do exactly what
[1:50:04] they did in acts 2:38 repent and be
[1:50:07] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:50:09] Jesus Christ we have the power to remit
[1:50:13] sin by what bringing people to
[1:50:16] repentance and baptism in his name
[1:50:18] filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[1:50:22] but don't turn this back into
[1:50:23] Catholicism notice he was a male am i he
[1:50:28] not her not a church she but his name
[1:50:33] not her name where he was going to meet
[1:50:36] the people was not in her name but in
[1:50:39] his name him the Lamb
[1:50:42] a man now we say the church the great
[1:50:46] mighty church she did this she did that
[1:50:48] she weighed the storms we picked up in
[1:50:51] population we're great numbers were
[1:50:53] mighty church he did great thing God
[1:50:55] never said anything about her she he
[1:50:59] said him him is the meeting place the
[1:51:03] lamb not to church not her but his name
[1:51:08] he didn't put her name anywhere he put
[1:51:12] his name and him that's why all we do on
[1:51:17] word or deed we must do all in the name
[1:51:20] of Jesus Christ if we pray we got
[1:51:23] pray in the name of Jesus if we walk we
[1:51:26] walk in Jesus name if we talk we talk in
[1:51:29] Jesus name if we baptized we got a
[1:51:31] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:51:33] all we do in word or deed do it in the
[1:51:36] name of Jesus Christ
[1:51:38] hey man so improving his word proven his
[1:51:43] word he sus Jude believe it
[1:51:46] if so reached out my faith and touch His
[1:51:50] garment because he's passing this way oh
[1:51:54] ma I believe you pass right by this way
[1:51:58] in this service this morning I believe
[1:52:00] he's here to heal ever sick to save ever
[1:52:03] lost a man turns he show his work of
[1:52:07] redemption that he still heals we've
[1:52:11] seen him do it hey man we've seen him do
[1:52:14] extraordinary things we've seen the
[1:52:17] cancer field and man we've seen the
[1:52:20] brain bleed field we're seeing the
[1:52:22] cripples walk we've seen the kidneys
[1:52:24] restored come on we've seen the eyes
[1:52:27] that have been healed over and over and
[1:52:30] over we've seen him as the high priests
[1:52:33] I many time others have we touched him
[1:52:40] you can touch him this morning though
[1:52:44] I'm with you always to the end of the
[1:52:48] world he's the same yesterday today and
[1:52:50] forever he's passing this way he's a
[1:52:53] high priest according to Hebrews the
[1:52:56] book of Hebrews four chapters and 15
[1:52:58] verse he is the high priest that can be
[1:53:00] touched by the feeling of our
[1:53:03] infirmities do you believe that I'm
[1:53:06] asking you this money do you believe
[1:53:08] that man then then he reached out and
[1:53:11] touch the Lord he he is ever-present
[1:53:13] although I with you always look down to
[1:53:16] the ages prove all things hold fast to
[1:53:18] that which is good now if you belong to
[1:53:20] a church that don't believe he's the
[1:53:22] same yesterday today and forever the
[1:53:24] same in every way get away from it
[1:53:27] that's your prophets instruction I think
[1:53:31] it's pretty good advice I have to say
[1:53:34] Amen to it
[1:53:35] remember cuz we ought to believe he's
[1:53:37] the same in every detail except for his
[1:53:41] corporal body a man the Bible said Jesus
[1:53:45] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:53:47] forever he's a high priest sitting there
[1:53:49] making intercession upon our confessions
[1:53:51] he we have to confess it first before he
[1:53:54] can be a high priest because he only
[1:53:57] intercedes to our confession is that
[1:53:59] right minister brethren the minister say
[1:54:01] man and he only intercedes upon our
[1:54:04] confession what we confess that he is
[1:54:06] and what he has done for us not he will
[1:54:09] do he's already done it we have to
[1:54:11] confess that he's done it he was wounded
[1:54:13] for our transgressions with his stripes
[1:54:15] we were healed what are we a confession
[1:54:18] it's painful it belongs to me then
[1:54:22] healing his mind he paid for it
[1:54:25] victory is mine he paid for it oh my god
[1:54:31] victory over this depression I can rise
[1:54:34] up above this hurt
[1:54:36] I can rise up above the confusion of the
[1:54:38] age because I have a high priest that I
[1:54:42] can touch who release his virtuous
[1:54:49] strength to me in the oddball sermon in
[1:54:56] jeffersonville in 64 you know God made
[1:54:59] this promise in the last day he made a
[1:55:01] promise and I can't make it happen I
[1:55:03] cannot do that he has to do that he's
[1:55:05] the one who doesn't not me but believe
[1:55:07] in him or I wouldn't be standing here
[1:55:12] telling you something I didn't believe
[1:55:15] in my brother brother makes a statement
[1:55:18] I wouldn't be standing here telling you
[1:55:20] something that I didn't believe in now
[1:55:25] you pray and you say Lord Jesus
[1:55:28] I'm taught in the Bible wonder who
[1:55:30] taught that wonder who's teaching this
[1:55:34] is brother Brennan said I wouldn't say
[1:55:36] it unless I believed it and then he said
[1:55:39] you pray Lord in the Bible I
[1:55:42] wonder who was teaching this was
[1:55:45] that a message in this day hey man now
[1:55:50] you praise say Lord Jesus I'm talking to
[1:55:52] Bible you're a high priest right now
[1:55:54] that can be touched by the feelings of
[1:55:57] our infirmities
[1:55:58] I don't care where you're just you just
[1:56:00] say I believe you and by faith I believe
[1:56:03] what that man said today that's what the
[1:56:07] angel told me get the people to believe
[1:56:08] you and if I tell them Word of God and
[1:56:11] they believe me it's believed the words
[1:56:12] apparently Hebrews 4 is still in effect
[1:56:16] that he's still the high priest that can
[1:56:19] be touched
[1:56:20] he's still the one that we go to the
[1:56:25] intercessor between God and man now and
[1:56:29] that means you'll say if it ain't it
[1:56:31] with the word I'm quoting now then don't
[1:56:33] believe it but you believe it's the word
[1:56:35] and then whatever it is you pray and
[1:56:37] believe and see if he will reveal what's
[1:56:40] in your heart now let me just tell you
[1:56:45] say there is no such a thing as an
[1:56:51] atonement of faith there is only an
[1:56:56] atonement of blood that blood is applied
[1:57:03] by faith like the blood was applied by
[1:57:07] hyssop but hyssop alone would not make
[1:57:12] the intercession and faith alone will
[1:57:17] not make an interception there has to be
[1:57:21] blood applied by faith not faith alone
[1:57:26] now so you see that blood is applied by
[1:57:30] faith but it's faith in the shed blood
[1:57:34] now there's never been I just wanted to
[1:57:38] say there's never been a time in human
[1:57:42] history where sins could be remitted
[1:57:45] without the shedding of blood now one
[1:57:49] example in the scripture all the way
[1:57:51] from Adam until now it's based upon the
[1:57:55] blood
[1:57:56] was shed so why not wait a minute
[1:57:59] brother Tim Jesus how did Jesus forgive
[1:58:01] sin before his blood was shed well how
[1:58:05] did he forgive sin all through the Old
[1:58:07] Testament through the blood of a
[1:58:11] sacrifice a man he will often say the
[1:58:15] people your sins are forgiven listen
[1:58:17] Jesus before Calvary was the high priest
[1:58:20] John said there's the Lamb of God hey
[1:58:24] man
[1:58:24] he was a high priest and he has to hope
[1:58:27] of God forgave sins based on the blood
[1:58:31] of innocent lambs that was shears
[1:58:35] accepted sacrifice until the day he died
[1:58:39] at Calvary after Calvary as high priest
[1:58:44] he forgave sins based on the shedding of
[1:58:47] his own it bud hey man now let's look in
[1:58:53] let's just look at the scripture let's
[1:58:55] take some Bible
[1:58:56] acts 20:28 because if we're gonna
[1:58:59] believe something it's got to have Bible
[1:59:01] Bible to back it up right a man acts 20
[1:59:05] and verse 28 take heed unto yourselves
[1:59:07] and to all the flock over which the Holy
[1:59:11] Ghost has made you overseers to feed the
[1:59:13] Church of God which he hath purchased
[1:59:17] with his own but notice it was how how
[1:59:23] does he how does he um purchase the
[1:59:27] flock he doesn't with his own but notice
[1:59:32] again Hebrews 9 and verse 12 by his own
[1:59:36] blood he entered into once into the holy
[1:59:40] place having obtained eternal redemption
[1:59:44] for us again by his own bad man by his
[1:59:51] own badge he entered into the holy place
[1:59:54] having obtained eternal redemption for
[1:59:58] us all right now in verse 13 wherefore
[2:00:02] jesus also that he might sanctify the
[2:00:04] people with his own blood
[2:00:06] suffered without the gate notice again
[2:00:09] sanctification making your holy only
[2:00:13] comes by his sad blood revelation 1 and
[2:00:18] 5 and from Jesus Christ who is the
[2:00:21] faithful witness and the first begotten
[2:00:23] of the Dead the Prince of the king of
[2:00:25] the earth until her and to him that
[2:00:28] loved us and washed us from our sins
[2:00:34] what in his own blood you see you know
[2:00:41] if it could be faith without blood then
[2:00:46] it would been unnecessary for Jesus to
[2:00:49] even die at Calvary all you have to do
[2:00:53] just have faith that's all we need to do
[2:00:56] to get people just to believe and now
[2:00:57] then Jesus would never it was it was
[2:01:00] unnecessary but you see without the
[2:01:03] shedding of blood there is no remission
[2:01:05] of sin before Calvary he this the blood
[2:01:09] was shed by animals a man and accepted
[2:01:14] sacrifice after Calvary by his own blood
[2:01:17] somebody help me preach amen so you see
[2:01:20] if it could be with bad faith without
[2:01:23] blood
[2:01:23] then it was unnecessary for Jesus to die
[2:01:27] now why go to Calvary wife suffer what
[2:01:31] all we have to do is just believe not
[2:01:34] that say Jesus for you to die or we just
[2:01:38] believe you know that our sins are going
[2:01:40] and and we just accept that forgiveness
[2:01:42] no there had to be something pay the
[2:01:46] price there had to be something
[2:01:48] eradicate sin somebody with me now in
[2:01:53] the future hold brother Brandon would
[2:01:55] say it this way his plan of redemption
[2:01:56] is exactly the same by everything he
[2:02:01] uses the same method he never changes he
[2:02:06] said in Malachi 3 I am God I changed not
[2:02:08] the way he does it
[2:02:09] therefore if he saved the first man he
[2:02:13] ever saved by the shed blood of an
[2:02:15] innocent one he'll have to
[2:02:17] the next and everyone he saves will have
[2:02:20] to be the same way if he healed a man at
[2:02:23] any time through the journey of life let
[2:02:26] it be in the days of Jesus now healing
[2:02:28] is salvation on the body right hey man
[2:02:33] so the salvation on the soul of course
[2:02:36] is saving the soul but it's it's the
[2:02:38] same work of redemption when Jesus paid
[2:02:40] for our our sins he paid for our healing
[2:02:43] is that right
[2:02:45] if you healed any man at any time to the
[2:02:47] journey of life let it be in the days of
[2:02:49] Jesus the Apostles the prophets wherever
[2:02:51] it was when the same conditions is met
[2:02:54] he's got to do it again that's right he
[2:02:57] doesn't change man changes time changes
[2:03:00] ages changes dispensation changes but
[2:03:03] God remains the same he's perfect
[2:03:07] what a hope that ought to give to sick
[2:03:09] people
[2:03:10] amen if he ever healed a person he's got
[2:03:13] to do it again when the same conditions
[2:03:16] in math if he ever ever saved a man he's
[2:03:19] got to do it on the same grounds he did
[2:03:21] it out the first time that's why your
[2:03:24] eternal prescription goes all the way
[2:03:26] back to acts 2:38 repent every one of
[2:03:30] you and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:03:33] Christ for remission of sin and you saw
[2:03:35] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen
[2:03:39] if you ever mad filled a man with the
[2:03:41] Holy Ghost you've got to do it on the
[2:03:42] same grounds he did it the first time
[2:03:44] this is what brother branham's little
[2:03:46] nephew would come to him and say brother
[2:03:48] Branham I'm having dreams and everything
[2:03:50] and I'm lost and and he said he called
[2:03:54] his name and he said son you know you
[2:03:55] you there's only one hope for you know
[2:03:58] Mary Hail Marys will do it no church
[2:04:01] join us we'll do it you've got to come
[2:04:03] the same way of acts 2:38 this day this
[2:04:07] scriptures fulfilled he still pulling
[2:04:09] him right back to the eternal
[2:04:11] prescription a man if he ever filled a
[2:04:15] man with the Holy Ghost he gotta do it
[2:04:16] on the same girls he did it the first
[2:04:18] time if he ever raced a man up from the
[2:04:21] grave he's got to do it the second time
[2:04:23] wherever
[2:04:24] other time on the same principle he
[2:04:26] doesn't change
[2:04:27] oh what a hope that gives me what is it
[2:04:31] not a sudden man-made via theory
[2:04:35] something that groups of men have come
[2:04:37] together but is on changeable word you
[2:04:42] say it is it the truthful he said let
[2:04:44] every man's word be a lie mine be true
[2:04:46] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[2:04:49] words shall not fail all Scripture is
[2:04:51] given for inspiration therefore it's
[2:04:53] good and profitable for doctors and
[2:04:55] remember that all scripture will be
[2:04:57] fulfilled every bit of it
[2:05:00] such simple there is no remission of sin
[2:05:04] without the shedding of blood all the
[2:05:09] faith in the world will not remit since
[2:05:13] it is blood detriment sins but of course
[2:05:18] a pardon must be received by faith and
[2:05:23] the blood is applied by faith notice he
[2:05:27] again proven his word he decided in the
[2:05:30] Garden of Eden he would save how he
[2:05:33] would save man through the shed blood of
[2:05:36] an innocent one he's never changed it we
[2:05:39] try to change it through education
[2:05:41] through towers of Babel through great
[2:05:43] cities and everything like that we try
[2:05:46] to change it but it don't work we try to
[2:05:51] change it by educating the world in him
[2:05:53] we try to change it by denomination of
[2:05:55] people it never worked only one place
[2:05:59] God will meet to worship is under the
[2:06:01] blood your denominations will split you
[2:06:04] up but under the blood you're the same
[2:06:07] he never changes he now if he's the
[2:06:12] unchangeable high priests and the same
[2:06:14] yesterday today and forever
[2:06:16] he's gotta keep that word not because we
[2:06:19] said he didn't because he said he would
[2:06:22] ma'am now again you know he he goes
[2:06:26] right on while I'm praying now and he
[2:06:28] would talk about that blood being
[2:06:31] between him and and God and it was the
[2:06:36] blood that
[2:06:37] made him perfect so what we can do
[2:06:42] without the blood today
[2:06:43] you better not one moment on the Oh
[2:06:49] without the blood you're a year go
[2:06:51] you're finished he says here he said now
[2:06:56] when I'm praying God don't see me he
[2:07:02] just hears my voice through the blood of
[2:07:05] Jesus he don't see me he hears my voice
[2:07:10] and that blood this is this is 1964
[2:07:15] heads of the seals and that blood there
[2:07:17] is to represent what I asked this he he
[2:07:21] hears my voice but he sees only the
[2:07:23] blood
[2:07:24] oh that oughta make you shout but what
[2:07:29] are we saying when you talk that blacks
[2:07:32] beats when you pray he he looks any
[2:07:37] seasons the bad interceding it's not you
[2:07:42] just a mere man making a prayer it's
[2:07:44] that blood interceding on your behalf
[2:07:48] and God can't turn down the blood of his
[2:07:52] own son
[2:07:54] it's the purchase price this is what
[2:07:57] brother Branham told you when you pray
[2:07:59] you present your token with your prayer
[2:08:04] because the token is a Holy Ghost which
[2:08:08] is which is the sign that the blood has
[2:08:10] been applied it's the life of the blood
[2:08:14] we do not have our bloodless religion
[2:08:16] because we got the Holy Ghost the Holy
[2:08:18] Ghost is the life of the blood and when
[2:08:22] you have the Holy Ghost you have the
[2:08:24] blood so what are you doing you're
[2:08:26] praying through the Holy Ghost amen it's
[2:08:30] not you speaking anymores
[2:08:31] Oh somebody help me preach when you go
[2:08:34] to pray and it ain't you speak it

[2:08:40] calling on God and God's moving on your
[2:08:42] behalf
[2:08:44] and we know this if we ask anything
[2:08:47] according to his will he will do it
[2:08:51] it is wills his word he wants to heal he

[2:11:35] there to present to represent what I ask
[2:11:38] then he hears my voice but he sees only
[2:11:41] the blood he don't see me so I can't be
[2:11:45] dirty when I'm under the bud the blood
[2:11:50] cleanses he's the bumper between me and
[2:11:52] God and promise ask the Father anything
[2:11:56] I'll do it
[2:11:57] you've been do you believe that has to
[2:12:00] be true now this this quote meets all
[2:12:02] the criteria
[2:12:03] it was priest after the seals and it was
[2:12:06] preached in the tabernacle and he wasn't
[2:12:08] preaching to denomination he's preaching
[2:12:10] to his folks
[2:12:11] it meets all the criteria you have no
[2:12:14] reason to doubt it man there's a black
[2:12:17] bumper for you and for me Oh hallelujah
[2:12:24] the blood cleanses the spirit is a token
[2:12:29] that the blood has been applied this is
[2:12:33] from theirs now is from the token
[2:12:36] message the Spirit is the token that the
[2:12:39] blood has been applied until the blood
[2:12:43] is applied the Spirit cannot come but
[2:12:46] when the blood is applied then the
[2:12:48] Spirit is the token the sign sending it
[2:12:51] back to you that your faith and the
[2:12:53] blood has been accepted and your fare is
[2:12:56] paid your fare is paid it's all over the
[2:12:59] case is closed
[2:13:02] you're a Christian you're a believer
[2:13:05] crisis and you and you're in Christ I am
[2:13:10] man so now how are we the blood of
[2:13:13] Christ well you know that we don't have
[2:13:16] the chemistry of the blood today and
[2:13:18] then we have the life that was in the
[2:13:20] blood and then the chemistry went back
[2:13:23] into the ground and maybe was a sorbed
[2:13:25] into the wood of the cross or into the
[2:13:27] ground I don't know we're all in it went
[2:13:29] maybe if some of us peeled up on his
[2:13:32] garments there went a hundred different
[2:13:34] places we don't know where the chemistry
[2:13:36] went but we know where the life with
[2:13:40] because the life that was in the blood
[2:13:43] raised him up on the third day a man
[2:13:47] ascended into glory and here he came
[2:13:50] back the life of the blood came back on
[2:13:54] the date of Pentecost
[2:13:55] - by that hundred and twenty first
[2:13:58] initial one to be filled with the Holy
[2:14:00] Ghost
[2:14:02] so that makes every born-again believer
[2:14:06] of every age the blood by the spirit
[2:14:12] they were in the upper room they were
[2:14:15] the blood by the spirit today we are the
[2:14:18] blood by the spirit know brother Branham
[2:14:26] said the church is the blood of Christ
[2:14:28] by the Spirit because the life is in the
[2:14:32] blood
[2:14:33] that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:14:36] that baptizes us into his body there
[2:14:39] recognizes only his body his flesh his
[2:14:42] word then we'll read you something from
[2:14:44] the seventh seal now we we come from God
[2:14:47] in simplicity and we're here now on the
[2:14:50] last seal even question answers has
[2:14:53] already been done come to the last
[2:14:56] sermon seventh seal brother Brennan said
[2:15:01] I thank God for his word I thank him for
[2:15:05] Jesus Christ
[2:15:06] for without sending him for the
[2:15:10] perpetuation of our sins we'll all be in
[2:15:14] a
[2:15:14] big muck of sin with no hope but by His
[2:15:18] grace his blood cleanses which is
[2:15:20] present since all sins just like the
[2:15:26] drop of ink in a bucket of Clorox you'll
[2:15:29] never find the ink again and when our
[2:15:32] sins are confessed it is foot in the
[2:15:36] blood of Jesus Christ they'll never be
[2:15:38] known again God forgives him there never
[2:15:43] was even done and as long as that
[2:15:45] sacrifice
[2:15:46] oh listen now seventh seal and as long
[2:15:49] as that sacrifice is layin there in and
[2:15:53] atonement for us then that's all that's
[2:15:56] it we're not sinners no more we're
[2:15:58] Christians by the grace of God
[2:16:02] hallelujah now you may have wondered
[2:16:04] about some of the things that he said
[2:16:06] but he couldn't write down the end and
[2:16:08] sums it all up and he says let that
[2:16:10] sacrifice his lay in there as an
[2:16:13] atonement for us and then he would prove
[2:16:17] it time and time again by invoking the
[2:16:21] high priest and the theme the theme
[2:16:29] throughout the seals was that we have a
[2:16:32] blood that is a bleach for sin that will
[2:16:41] change every chemistry of it of sin
[2:16:45] every molecule of it and send it back
[2:16:50] through the working of that bleach until
[2:16:54] it lands back on the head of your
[2:16:56] accuser
[2:16:58] [Applause]
[2:17:00] hallelujah amen what sins are you
[2:17:03] talking about
[2:17:06] hallelujah we'll dip them in the bleach
[2:17:09] and they ain't no more and they've been
[2:17:12] changed every every molecule of it until
[2:17:16] it leaves on the accuser and he will go
[2:17:21] to hell not you and he will be punished
[2:17:25] not you why because he took my
[2:17:30] punishment vicariously on the cross
[2:17:36] that's the atonement the original
[2:17:38] atonement brother Branham would teach
[2:17:46] this principle nice sitting here in
[2:17:49] counseling now do you think he would lie
[2:17:52] to people when he's counseling 1964 just
[2:17:56] before he preaches the masterpiece I
[2:17:59] want to interview a few moments ago I
[2:18:02] speak into person in the room that's
[2:18:03] present now his sister Georgie Bruce you
[2:18:05] can you can go and listen to her a
[2:18:08] recorded testimony or not testimonial
[2:18:11] brother branham speak into her and she
[2:18:16] said but brother Branham I have so many
[2:18:19] things that I know that's wrong and he
[2:18:24] said a godly little woman wouldn't you
[2:18:27] like a prophet to say that about you
[2:18:30] that's what God says about you there's
[2:18:36] no one greater than Jesus and I said but
[2:18:41] look sister don't look at yourself it's
[2:18:45] just what your desire isn't what you try
[2:18:48] to do and if you really love the Lord
[2:18:50] you try to serve him with all your heart
[2:18:55] but since the seals is open there's no
[2:18:58] more mercy and there's no more grace and
[2:19:01] the lamb has left the seat of
[2:19:03] intercessory and now that ain't what he
[2:19:05] said you try to serve him with all your
[2:19:09] heart how many's there how many is there
[2:19:13] that's your testimony this Mon you
[2:19:14] trying to serve him with all your heart
[2:19:16] and then all your mistakes how many get
[2:19:19] there but I made so many and all your
[2:19:22] mistakes is here in the blood of the
[2:19:29] Lord Jesus
[2:19:32] Wow you say brother Dilma I've got a lot
[2:19:36] of folks right I'm in the blood in the
[2:19:40] blood well I see a cleansing stream of
[2:19:44] blood it froze from Calvary it's waves
[2:19:50] which reach the throat of God are
[2:19:53] sweeping over me hallelujah well and
[2:20:05] those condemnation comes you say I
[2:20:08] sinned there's no use to pray that's
[2:20:12] what Satan says no used to pray I look
[2:20:16] away to Jesus and he tells me to say I
[2:20:20] see a crimson stream blood
[2:20:25] thank God for the blood the message
[2:20:29] brought you back to the original
[2:20:31] autonomous are you with me now a man you
[2:20:35] say not me brother Tim I'll tell you
[2:20:37] what now I'll tell you I don't need no
[2:20:38] blood mmm and I'll tell you what I'm I'm
[2:20:41] maturing perfect and hallelujah I moved
[2:20:43] my way to heaven higher I'm now we've
[2:20:46] our grow this bleedy sacrifice we don't
[2:20:48] need nobody up there like that well
[2:20:51] here's what brother Branham said now you
[2:20:53] you know what you and you wouldn't
[2:20:56] believe how many false prophets preached
[2:20:58] that kind of nonsense
[2:21:05] have you ever seen such a time of such
[2:21:07] arrogance
[2:21:13] sixty-three after the seals any man it
[2:21:20] is subject to mistakes now Christian
[2:21:25] does not willfully sin but he does make
[2:21:29] mistakes you made a mistake this morning
[2:21:33] when you didn't really pray you didn't
[2:21:37] do a job Jesus said we should often pray
[2:21:40] that sin sin of omission brother Brandon
[2:21:47] would often pray God forgive me of my
[2:21:49] unbelief that's where we all get faced
[2:21:57] with things and we wobble and
[2:22:00] wandering vacillating brother Branham
[2:22:08] would have to pray himself after seeing
[2:22:10] millions hundreds millions thousands
[2:22:13] whatever number multitude without number
[2:22:16] of miracles and would still have to
[2:22:19] wrassle with unbelief Satan would come
[2:22:24] to him and say you ain't nothing but a
[2:22:26] fake and these miracles you're talking
[2:22:28] about isn't real and brother Brent said
[2:22:37] I listen to him for a little bit and he
[2:22:42] said after a while I got tired of him
[2:22:43] and he said Satan I resent you coming
[2:22:47] now you get out of here in the name of
[2:22:49] Jesus Christ and he said he fled from my
[2:22:53] room and he said after that here come a
[2:22:56] real sweet spirit in the room and it
[2:23:00] said to me don't never fear to go
[2:23:02] anywhere or do anything but that
[2:23:04] never-failing presence of jesus christ
[2:23:07] is with you wherever you go I say
[2:23:10] hallelujah what a consolation he will
[2:23:15] never leave us or forsake us
[2:23:19] in the darkness of the midnight
[2:23:21] I hear Satan come around you're not
[2:23:27] winning the battle you're just losing
[2:23:29] ground and then I hear a voice saying
[2:23:34] pick up your sword
[2:23:39] hey man any man is subject mistakes he's
[2:23:44] subject to error because he's human
[2:23:46] he's subject to the violation of God's
[2:23:49] law and remember offend at one point
[2:23:53] you're guilty of Arlen that's Bible he
[2:24:00] is subject to many things because Satan
[2:24:03] tempts him and he's just a human being
[2:24:08] and if God oh listen this and if God
[2:24:14] ever lifted his hands he would fall
[2:24:17] that's all and I've heard people say Oh
[2:24:22] Satan can't do that yes you just let God
[2:24:25] lift his hand one time and watch what
[2:24:28] happens I constantly please God don't
[2:24:32] send him have mercy on me keep him away
[2:24:35] from me
[2:24:36] I need God's mercy and we all need that
[2:24:41] brethren Aegis out there that needs
[2:24:44] God's mercy it's all of us in here that
[2:24:47] needs God's mercy and I didn't just need
[2:24:50] it at the altar when I got safe I need
[2:24:53] it every day we're not saying I needed
[2:24:56] today I needed tomorrow I'll need it the
[2:24:59] next day
[2:24:59] I need mercy his mercy / mercy no don't
[2:25:07] ever think that Satan's Eden brother
[2:25:11] Branham says dissin meets the criteria
[2:25:17] 265 Jeffersonville
[2:25:19] Oh God help us to be pure in the sight
[2:25:24] of your Lord no matter what man thinks
[2:25:27] about us what other people say
[2:25:30] Lord let our conversations be holy
[2:25:34] let it be seasoned with God's Word so
[2:25:37] Sita milord that there's no guy on that
[2:25:41] means no dishonesty found in us while we
[2:25:45] plead in our own mistakes that the blood
[2:25:48] of Jesus Christ will stand between us
[2:25:51] and God that he'll look down upon us
[2:25:54] through the blood of Jesus not upon our
[2:25:57] own righteousness or who we are or what
[2:25:59] we've done but upon his merits alone
[2:26:05] aren't you glad for the blood hey man
[2:26:10] now then brother Branham had some of the
[2:26:13] same thoughts you did had a friend a
[2:26:16] brother supporter and there's meeting
[2:26:19] the young preacher he got under roof I
[2:26:22] guess he was working sidewall mashed him
[2:26:25] down underneath that and they said he
[2:26:29] was gonna die
[2:26:30] his liver were buzz bursted his spleen
[2:26:32] was knocked out of place tons had fallen
[2:26:34] on him brother Branham was concerned
[2:26:38] about this and he said you know I talked
[2:26:42] to my wife at breakfast I said you know
[2:26:46] what you you wife you know if Jesus was
[2:26:48] here you know what he would do when he
[2:26:52] sponsored me he said I believe that word
[2:26:55] and he was sponsoring Christ I said this
[2:26:57] is a trick of the devil I just want you
[2:27:01] to realize things that are happen to you
[2:27:04] or trick of the devil and I said if
[2:27:10] Jesus was here he'd go lay his holy
[2:27:13] hands upon him and that boy would get
[2:27:16] well I don't care if his liver is
[2:27:19] bursted he would get well because Jesus
[2:27:23] would walk in there knowing exactly who
[2:27:26] he was he knew his call and and the
[2:27:29] Scriptures was right vindicated in him
[2:27:31] he knew he was not a shadow of doubt he
[2:27:34] lay hands upon him and say son be well
[2:27:36] we'll walk out there and I said then
[2:27:39] enough Devils in Hell to kill that boy
[2:27:42] he would get well but you see honey he
[2:27:46] was Jesus the holy hands of God and I
[2:27:52] was I'm a sinner I was born sex of birth
[2:27:55] my father mother were both sinners I'm
[2:27:58] just no good nothing many times that's
[2:28:01] the way we look at ourselves you're not
[2:28:06] a no-good nothing
[2:28:08] you're the purchased of his blood there
[2:28:15] was an old man one time story of an old
[2:28:19] man that got run over he was he was a
[2:28:22] kind of a
[2:28:23] really poor lived in a little poor place
[2:28:27] but he was a Christian you know
[2:28:31] Christians ain't always rich we go Paul
[2:28:34] said sometimes I'm in need of one and
[2:28:36] you know I'm a need of food I'm in need
[2:28:39] of shelter I'm in the there's many times
[2:28:42] God doesn't make us all the same man
[2:28:47] looks down upon them bases man's worth
[2:28:51] by his wealth by his clothes God looks
[2:28:54] at the heart and this whole man had he
[2:28:58] had he'd been a street preacher and
[2:29:01] preached for years and years on the
[2:29:03] street passed out tracts somebody young
[2:29:07] people carelessly come and I turn the
[2:29:11] corner too fast and hit him they picked
[2:29:15] him up thought he was dead
[2:29:17] took him into the hospital and said you
[2:29:23] know he's an old man the doctors were
[2:29:24] talking among themselves said listen he
[2:29:27] ain't worth much he just thought
[2:29:30] on the street there we you know it is
[2:29:34] life just about over with anyway and you
[2:29:37] know he's just a poor boy couldn't pay
[2:29:40] and he said you know what we what we do
[2:29:43] is we just kind of you know just do the
[2:29:47] minimal we can for him because he's not
[2:29:50] worth fixing up well the old man wasn't
[2:29:52] as dead as he thought he was
[2:29:55] he spoke up in Sybil Circe you may not
[2:30:00] think I'm worth much but I'm worth the
[2:30:04] purchase blood of Jesus Christ cuz my
[2:30:08] Lord went to Calvary and he paid his
[2:30:10] room and gave his own blood for me and
[2:30:12] I'm worth a whole lot more than what you
[2:30:15] think I am I think sometimes you need to
[2:30:20] remind the devil you're worth you're
[2:30:26] worth something to him because he gave
[2:30:29] his whole life for you said you know but
[2:30:33] you know what if the Lord would just
[2:30:36] give me a vision and send me down there
[2:30:38] then then that would be different
[2:30:40] so I'd go down there and lay my hands on
[2:30:43] him he'd come out of that bed if he'd
[2:30:45] give me a vision said then I got to
[2:30:47] thinking after all it was if it was a
[2:30:52] vision what was it if it's the same
[2:30:54] dirty hands on him same man praying for
[2:30:57] him same dirty hands then I began to
[2:31:01] think I'm his representative then God
[2:31:05] doesn't see me that blood of that
[2:31:09] righteous one lays it there on the altar
[2:31:12] it makes intercessions for me he is my
[2:31:16] sufficiency he is my prayer he is my
[2:31:20] life the only thing that made me put my
[2:31:23] hand on him with faith because I had
[2:31:25] faith in the vision and without the
[2:31:26] vision the same faith would do the same
[2:31:29] thing so I can recognize reckon myself
[2:31:32] nothing and reckon him my all and all he
[2:31:36] is my life he's my commissioner no
[2:31:38] denomination sent me
[2:31:40] he sent me hallelujah I go in his name I
[2:31:43] lay my hands upon him
[2:31:45] I walk down there and laid hands on that
[2:31:46] boy Oh hallelujah Amen laid hands upon
[2:31:51] that boy and he said that night he was
[2:31:53] in the meeting oh yes he is that
[2:31:57] fountain no other fount I know nothing
[2:31:59] but the blood of Jesus I'm a stinker I'm
[2:32:03] a renegade every one of us are bub
[2:32:06] God we're perfect being therefore
[2:32:09] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[2:32:12] perfect how can you be because a perfect
[2:32:15] one represents us there that fountain is
[2:32:18] there every day fresh not some stagnated
[2:32:23] something but fresh every day that
[2:32:26] washes away all my sins he is that
[2:32:29] fountain
[2:32:32] hallelujah aren't you glad that we have
[2:32:34] the resources of that fountain aren't
[2:32:37] you glad that he said whoever blesses me
[2:32:40] will be blessed and whoever curses me
[2:32:42] will be cursed hallelujah aren't you
[2:32:46] glad that we have the right man as a
[2:32:48] believer they're not putting our
[2:32:50] unworthy hands but all but take him
[2:32:53] because he made us worthy by his blood
[2:32:56] and bless my brother in his name
[2:33:00] hallelujah that's his promise Wow he
[2:33:06] heard me through the bad he didn't hear
[2:33:09] me as a mere man but he heard me through
[2:33:13] the blood and he cannot turn down the
[2:33:16] blood I'm glad for that oh you said well
[2:33:29] now now I'm not anymore brother damn man
[2:33:31] you know Christ is no longer an
[2:33:33] intercessor you know what brother
[2:33:35] Branham said he took the book of
[2:33:38] redemption in his hand the bloody lamb
[2:33:40] stands on the altar of sacrifice where's
[2:33:44] this priest it reaches a criteria pretty
[2:33:48] good six seal then how'd that any man
[2:33:53] anybody just say that Mary or Joseph or
[2:33:56] any other mortal could be an intercessor
[2:34:00] you cannot intercessor unless there's
[2:34:03] blood there yes sir there's one mediator
[2:34:06] between God and man and that's Christ
[2:34:08] Jesus and that's what the scripture said
[2:34:10] there he stands and until the last soul
[2:34:14] has been redeemed and then he comes with
[2:34:16] the claim what he has
[2:34:18] redeemed when when the last soul has
[2:34:24] been renamed a man now then he says now
[2:34:30] I've always taught that in the mouth do
[2:34:33] you this cook continued then the mouth
[2:34:35] of two or three witnesses let every word
[2:34:38] be established and the scripture just
[2:34:40] like you can't take one scripture and
[2:34:42] prove nothing
[2:34:43] let's search something else goes with it
[2:34:45] see I can take one scripture and say
[2:34:46] Judas went and hung himself take another
[2:34:49] and say you go do the same but you see
[2:34:51] it won't blend with the rest of it and
[2:34:54] when we go and cherry-pick our quotes
[2:34:58] and make it something that the rest of
[2:35:02] the word doesn't say hey man well what
[2:35:07] are we doing we're doing exactly what he
[2:35:09] said well you know we we are we're
[2:35:11] cherry-picking it were that Judas make
[2:35:13] it we're what Judas wouldn't hung
[2:35:15] himself go thou and do thou likewise
[2:35:17] putting your scriptures together like
[2:35:20] that brother we are to rightly divide
[2:35:22] the word of truth and when you rightly
[2:35:26] divide it we find out we have a high
[2:35:29] priest that can be touched with the
[2:35:32] feelings of our infirmities we find out
[2:35:35] that there's a blood and then that there
[2:35:38] is a lamb the paid redemptions price a
[2:35:42] man we find out man the cold creats can
[2:35:46] never bring us to a real harvest we've
[2:35:49] got to have a church that's washed in
[2:35:51] the blood of the Lamb and then we got to
[2:35:54] understand that we have been called back
[2:35:56] to the original atonement and standing
[2:36:00] there under that blood we have been
[2:36:03] justified you said brother Tim you said
[2:36:05] we don't need the blood anymore because
[2:36:07] we're now justified and we never did it
[2:36:09] in the first place
[2:36:10] yes brother Brennaman did say they did
[2:36:14] say that he took away your shame and he
[2:36:17] put it in the sea of his forgetfulness
[2:36:19] by the washing of the water of the word
[2:36:22] and the blood
[2:36:24] life so don't tell me you can be verges
[2:36:27] without the blood that's why we're
[2:36:29] birches this morning a man that's why we
[2:36:32] have an atonement it's because there's a
[2:36:35] crimson stream of life because there's a
[2:36:38] provision made at Calvary and because
[2:36:41] through that blood we can get any prayer
[2:36:43] answered any time amen when we pray he
[2:36:47] only sees the blood when I see the blood
[2:36:52] I'll pass over you amen let's bow our
