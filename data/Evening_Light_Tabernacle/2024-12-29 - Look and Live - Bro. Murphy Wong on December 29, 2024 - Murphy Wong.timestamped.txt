[48:03] today we got a year looking ahead we'll
[48:07] have a New Year's service on Tuesday
[48:10] night it will not be a Wednesday night
[48:11] meeting this coming up but Tuesday night
[48:14] brother Murphy will be
[48:16] speaking we have brother Murphy Wong
[48:18] with us today to minister to
[48:21] us I think you know God's grace Upon Our
[48:25] Lives and reach an ever predestinated
[48:29] seed I think of what the scriptures said
[48:32] where he where he declared and made it
[48:36] clear that this last prophecy would be
[48:39] to every nation Kindred tongue and
[48:42] people I think it where he said that the
[48:45] book would be sealed into the time of
[48:47] the end in the Book of Daniel he tells
[48:49] us the words are closed up and sealed at
[48:52] the time of the end but then it'll be a
[48:55] time where
[48:57] men will run to and fro travel will be
[49:00] vastly
[49:01] increased and I think in this day where
[49:04] we have the opportunity to reach around
[49:06] the world even in this broadcast today
[49:09] in the services that will go forth from
[49:11] this church I know that God will
[49:14] minister to hearts and lives of people
[49:17] he'll reach his elect he'll call his
[49:20] bride to attention and even those that
[49:23] are out of Step will hear the words of
[49:26] God to get back in line and we're here
[49:29] today if you know maybe you're out of
[49:31] line maybe you've been out of Step
[49:33] today's there's no day like today to get
[49:37] in line just get in March and tune with
[49:40] the Gospel of Jesus Christ we're in the
[49:43] last days little children and we must
[49:46] prepare for the coming of the lord we
[49:49] are nearer now than when we first
[49:51] believed so as we today prepare our
[49:55] hearts I want to just welcome our
[49:58] brother Murphy Wong brother Murphy is a
[50:02] precious dear friend of mine and someone
[50:05] that I've learned to love and respect
[50:07] his in his ministry has blessed
[50:10] thousands around the world back in 1995
[50:14] brother John leay and those that were
[50:15] with him witnessed to him and and from
[50:20] there he it started a journey and he he
[50:25] came to know the Lord and a greater way
[50:27] than he ever knew him and the message of
[50:30] the of the hour took hold in his life
[50:35] and he didn't just sit on it but you
[50:38] know since that time he has translated
[50:42] ever sermon of brother Brams in
[50:45] into um the Chinese
[50:48] language this next year by February uh
[50:52] in the month of February he'll finish
[50:54] the uh voice over
[50:57] of the ever taped sermon that's where
[50:59] brother bram's voice is played in the
[51:01] background and an interpretation into
[51:03] Chinese will go into there we'll make a
[51:06] tape for them to listen so he'd be the
[51:08] voice of William brandham in
[51:12] China and so
[51:14] is then but that wasn't all but seeing
[51:18] that they had only the official version
[51:22] of the Chinese Bible that would be
[51:24] allowed by the government
[51:27] he translated the Bible Into The King
[51:30] The King James Bible into the uh the
[51:33] language the Chinese language for the
[51:36] Chinese people so that they would have
[51:40] the whole word of God because the Bibles
[51:44] that they had left a lot out and so you
[51:48] know this has been his burden this has
[51:50] been his vision and I want him to be
[51:53] able to share that with you today of
[51:55] what God has done in his life and how
[51:58] he's used him and then how that we're
[52:01] here in this last day to finish the
[52:04] Divine call we're the last runners in
[52:07] the race and the Baton has been passed
[52:11] to you so as we take and we run and we
[52:15] look toward
[52:17] 2025 we want to run with all our hearts
[52:20] we want to throw every encumbrance on
[52:23] our lives aside every weight every sin
[52:27] that would so easily beset us pushing
[52:30] aside all unbelief and put everything we
[52:33] got into it and finish the
[52:37] race we want to finish
[52:40] strong we want to finish strong today at
[52:44] the end of the service we'll have a
[52:46] baptismal service Sister Janice Adams
[52:49] has just really surrendered her life to
[52:51] the Lord I've known him for many many
[52:54] years and you know this is a testimony
[52:57] for many of you you might have been up
[52:59] you might have been down you might have
[53:01] been in you might have been out of
[53:02] church and whatever but you know there
[53:05] comes that
[53:06] moment in a life where you make that
[53:09] full
[53:10] surrender and I believe she has made a
[53:13] full surrender to God she wants she
[53:15] wants to know she's filled with the Holy
[53:18] Ghost and she's prepared to meet the
[53:20] Lord so today her son brother Joe Adams
[53:24] and I will baptize her in the wonderful
[53:27] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I
[53:29] believe there's one coming after that
[53:32] will fill her with the Holy Ghost
[53:34] baptize her with the Holy Ghost in
[53:37] fire amen let's as we close out this
[53:41] year let's close it out with a
[53:43] Thanksgiving to God for the great things
[53:46] that he has done and with a look toward
[53:49] 2025 that I press toward the mark for

[56:14] scripture right away let's turn to a a
[56:17] book of a numbers
[56:29] book of numbers of chapter
[56:45] 21 I'll let read from verse one and when
[56:49] King read the Canaanites which had dwelt
[56:52] in this house H tell that Jesus of that
[56:56] the Israel came by the way of the spies
[56:59] then he fought against the Israel and
[57:02] took some of them prisoners and Israel
[57:04] vow a vow unto the Lord and said if thou
[57:07] will indeed deliver this people into my
[57:10] hand then I will utterly destroy their
[57:16] City uh and the Lord hearkened to the
[57:19] voice of Israel and delivered up the
[57:21] Canaanites and they utterly destroyed
[57:24] them and their cities and he called the
[57:26] name of the place of horah and they
[57:29] journeyed from the mount by the
[57:31] way of the Red Sea to comp to come past
[57:34] the land of Edom and the soul of the
[57:36] people was much discouraged because of
[57:39] the way and the people spake it against
[57:42] God and that against Moses wherefore
[57:45] have ye brought us up out of Egypt to
[57:48] die in the wilderness for there is no
[57:51] bread neither is there any water and our
[57:54] soul loest this light bread and the Lord
[57:57] sent fiery serpents among the people and
[58:00] they bite the people and much people out
[58:03] of Israel died therefore that the people
[58:06] came to Moses and said we have sinned
[58:09] for we have spoken against the Lord and
[58:11] that against thee prayed unto the Lord
[58:14] that he take away the serpents from us
[58:17] and Moses pray for the people and the
[58:19] Lord said unto Moses make thee a fiery
[58:22] Serpent and said it everyone that is bit
[58:26] and and that that everyone that is Abit
[58:30] when he looks upon it shall live and
[58:34] Moses made a serpent of breast and put
[58:36] it upon a pole and it came to pass that
[58:39] if a serpent had bitten any man when he
[58:43] beheld a serpent of breast he liveth may
[58:46] the Lord blesses his word let's just bow
[58:49] our head one once
[58:51] more our gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[58:54] we have a turn over the pages but Lord
[58:58] that this is not a merely just an ank on

[59:05] Holy Spirit to reveal what is the
[59:08] countenance is inside of it Lord we dare

[1:00:02] uh once more I want to say uh thank you
[1:00:04] so much there especially uh brother Tim
[1:00:07] to give me this opportunity to uh speak
[1:00:09] to you uh you know years ago uh brother
[1:00:12] Tim just um uh mentioned that I was um
[1:00:15] came into the message in
[1:00:17] 1995 uh forever remembered that a moment
[1:00:21] when brother John le uh that he has um
[1:00:24] uh put put all the message book in his
[1:00:27] backpack and then went out to a a
[1:00:30] garment to church just outside of there
[1:00:33] and shared a a message to me a little I
[1:00:36] think a little did he know that it will
[1:00:38] become the result like today little did
[1:00:40] I know that will be the uh the result of
[1:00:43] the today how the word that came my way
[1:00:46] and but I know that God has a greater
[1:00:48] picture and at our eyes when look at it
[1:00:51] things we only look at uh so far right
[1:00:53] now because we're human but when God to
[1:00:56] look at his things he look way further
[1:00:58] ahead but it doesn't it doesn't take it
[1:01:01] us to uh to see far because as a human
[1:01:04] we don't see far but we're so thankful
[1:01:07] to the Lord he led us to have the spirit
[1:01:10] to yield to him and when we don't see
[1:01:13] far but we have a confidence to know
[1:01:15] whatever God has ordained whatever God
[1:01:19] has has plan that he will Carri out and
[1:01:22] if we just surrendered our will to him
[1:01:25] then uh he will make it things as come
[1:01:27] to pass and uh I just saw brother Craig
[1:01:30] uh so nice to see you again has been the
[1:01:34] bosom of friends that we've been the uh
[1:01:36] been the ministers that in the Wai in
[1:01:39] Connecticut and in your uh churches over
[1:01:42] there and we have a wonderful time I
[1:01:45] just have so many people is that
[1:01:47] David I just cannot believe that's uh
[1:01:50] that's a impossible and he I couldn't I
[1:01:53] was just drawn I said I think that
[1:01:56] David well God bless you and so many
[1:01:59] friends over here just so I want to may
[1:02:01] the Lord bless every one of you and I
[1:02:04] would like you to speak this morning
[1:02:06] just to give it a title look and
[1:02:09] live you know we're coming to the time
[1:02:12] uh we really need to be
[1:02:14] focused um this is um brother BR says uh
[1:02:17] uh in a message that said when it come
[1:02:20] to the end of the world and when it come
[1:02:22] to the end of the consummation of the
[1:02:24] time and especially look to Jesus
[1:02:27] because there are so many distractions
[1:02:29] that on this Earth in this time uh is
[1:02:33] it's not how you are look at at the one
[1:02:34] thing is to keep on looking at because
[1:02:37] as the time goes by you will find out is
[1:02:40] um to look at a just one right thing
[1:02:43] become harder and harder and harder and
[1:02:46] to look at the things that that God
[1:02:48] ordained you to look at it become more
[1:02:50] difficult than ever it it's not because
[1:02:53] it's not attractive it's because there
[1:02:56] are so many distractions so many things
[1:02:59] that you could look at and if the
[1:03:01] certain if the people they look at to
[1:03:03] the certain thing you'll find out they
[1:03:05] become a weary they be they become a
[1:03:07] boring if just like the people the Lord
[1:03:11] just give them uh in the Israel the Lord
[1:03:13] will just give them the victory but very
[1:03:16] soon and the complaints start to come
[1:03:19] murmur start to come and people are so
[1:03:23] easily to forget what God has done
[1:03:25] that's that's why God constantly
[1:03:28] reminding us God doesn't constantly
[1:03:31] renewing things to attract our attention
[1:03:34] that is the world doing that is an
[1:03:37] entertainment in this world doing that
[1:03:39] is the videos of the movies and it
[1:03:42] everything they try to attract it to the
[1:03:44] people but God always just do us one
[1:03:47] thing he said keep look at the things I
[1:03:50] first give you to Luc it's uh but the
[1:03:54] devil who had got all the tinsels he got
[1:03:57] all the invention he got all the voices
[1:04:01] he got all the new Gadget some new idea
[1:04:04] some new psychology psychology some new
[1:04:07] book uh some new uh uh new YouTube
[1:04:10] version uh this person's idea that
[1:04:12] person's idea it was a constantly try to
[1:04:15] draw you and when time come like that
[1:04:18] especially Look Away to
[1:04:22] Jesus and is in the time that that a lot
[1:04:26] of time you'll find out when we look at
[1:04:28] the things and we become um uh seemingly
[1:04:31] the things that we look at doesn't do us
[1:04:34] any good and then that the people they
[1:04:37] get easily it's not this not only just
[1:04:40] distracted they said you know what I
[1:04:42] need to find some new way it seems like
[1:04:45] this doesn't work if you're taking a
[1:04:47] medication there one medication you go
[1:04:50] to the
[1:04:51] doctor and uh they they try you almost
[1:04:54] feel like you're a guinea pig and uh you
[1:04:57] go to the doctor they said that you know
[1:04:59] I got a certain symptom okay try this
[1:05:01] one and if this one doesn't work you go
[1:05:04] back to the doctor and said okay try
[1:05:05] this one and then the one after the one
[1:05:08] after the uh who are we you know uh am I
[1:05:11] just the garbage just a testing of the
[1:05:13] drug if this is work and that one to
[1:05:15] work but that's a human doctor but when
[1:05:17] God doing things he doesn't changes the
[1:05:21] medication when you take the medication
[1:05:24] doesn't work
[1:05:26] it's not to have just said okay give me
[1:05:28] some a new medication Lord give me some
[1:05:30] a new idea give me some a new preacher
[1:05:32] give me a new pastor give me some the
[1:05:34] new or things online this person said
[1:05:36] that no go back to the message God never
[1:05:40] changes a medication if the inoculation
[1:05:43] work on Jesus and that inoculation will
[1:05:45] work on you and God just like in the uh
[1:05:50] in a book of the first king if the Lord
[1:05:52] give the time we can go into that uh a
[1:05:56] little later and when the when the uh uh
[1:05:59] Elijah asked his the Servants of Gesa
[1:06:02] and went up to take a look and uh he
[1:06:05] asked him and said look at go up to look
[1:06:08] seven times and the g the servant in my
[1:06:12] wall say the first time I look nothing
[1:06:15] happened he said it didn't say change
[1:06:17] the direction he didn't say go look at
[1:06:20] the right and the Elijah said go up to
[1:06:23] look at again I been look at it to the
[1:06:26] Sea which is to the west and nothing
[1:06:28] happened he doesn't said to change your
[1:06:30] way of looking change the direction he
[1:06:32] said look at the same direction and look
[1:06:35] at the Time After Time After Time and
[1:06:38] one the seventh time there's a cloud
[1:06:42] rising and is in this seven times age if
[1:06:45] we keep on looking you will see that a
[1:06:47] rising Morning Star start to rising in
[1:06:50] your heart we have a more sure word in
[1:06:54] this hour God never change he want you
[1:06:56] to look at it the same thing you know
[1:06:59] appreciate the message just s simple
[1:07:01] message it's going to rain it's going to
[1:07:04] rain it's going to rain no matter how
[1:07:07] how much many different angle he
[1:07:10] approach he approach to the same subject
[1:07:12] is going to RN 120 years just thinking
[1:07:16] about it brother Tim PR if he can live
[1:07:18] that long he preached one message is
[1:07:20] going to
[1:07:21] RN it R last night
[1:07:26] he said it's impossible for another he
[1:07:28] only have one message to preach about
[1:07:30] and that it's going to rain you know we
[1:07:32] only have one message to preach it about
[1:07:34] it's going to have a Rapture it's going
[1:07:37] to have a body change God give us a
[1:07:39] message in this hour this is the only
[1:07:41] way for you to go to
[1:07:43] [Applause]
[1:07:45] that there's no other way this is the
[1:07:49] only way that you need to look
[1:07:52] at but instead of looking the way to the
[1:07:55] right thing you'll find out the people
[1:07:57] when they keep on looking at the right
[1:07:59] thing people want changes many times we
[1:08:02] look at the God's promise we look at
[1:08:05] God's
[1:08:06] word but it seems like it doesn't
[1:08:09] work wake after wake months after months
[1:08:13] you find out if the word work it should
[1:08:17] work
[1:08:18] now if the word should work my trial
[1:08:22] should be over it's been many years
[1:08:26] if this a work Lord 10 years is not
[1:08:30] enough for me to go into the tunnel and
[1:08:33] never saw the end of it Lord my children
[1:08:36] has been back has been backslide has
[1:08:39] been Wayward for so many years is
[1:08:41] another 5 years is not enough how long
[1:08:44] Lord are you going to
[1:08:46] wait and then we start to look at us
[1:08:49] things
[1:08:50] differently you still come to the
[1:08:52] church you still sit that at a pew
[1:08:56] but Zeal start to
[1:08:57] losing the passion start to losing why
[1:09:03] because when you're holding a gun gun
[1:09:07] it's not at the first second the second
[1:09:09] second when you're holding the the gun
[1:09:11] the longer you
[1:09:13] hold your hand start to shaking when you
[1:09:16] first your adrenaline when you go to
[1:09:18] hunting when you're adrenaline start to
[1:09:20] coming up your in your blood is that a
[1:09:23] word
[1:09:24] adrenaline I I I don't hunt so I don't
[1:09:27] know how how that feel so when you're
[1:09:29] holding that you try to calm yourself
[1:09:32] you try to aiming to the right but if
[1:09:35] the target isn't moving and you're
[1:09:37] holding you try to go in that the longer
[1:09:39] you hold and the the gun become a
[1:09:42] heavier you find out that there's many
[1:09:45] times that the people that start to
[1:09:46] losing their focus they're losing their
[1:09:49] aiming it's not that they don't aiming
[1:09:51] it it's not they don't Focus but they
[1:09:53] don't Focus long enough
[1:09:55] and then when he become a weary then he
[1:09:57] start to look at a different things and
[1:10:00] Israelites One Day become a weary
[1:10:03] instead of having the Mana instead of
[1:10:05] having the Lord had given them they said
[1:10:06] that this is a light bread we want
[1:10:09] something different we want to taste
[1:10:11] different we don't want a Mana anymore
[1:10:13] we want pizza we want a burger we want a
[1:10:16] different flavor Lord that this the one
[1:10:18] flavor you have been feding us for so
[1:10:22] long we want a different flavor of her
[1:10:24] preaching we want a different flavor of
[1:10:28] idea we want a different flavor of a
[1:10:31] music we want a different all thing all
[1:10:34] this world don't you find out and the
[1:10:36] world will try to cering to the people's
[1:10:39] taste is that that the the nutrients
[1:10:42] it's the taste of it it's you go to the
[1:10:45] restaurant you don't go for a restaurant
[1:10:47] maybe you do just for salad I said poor
[1:10:51] you you go to your restaurant you for a
[1:10:54] taste you go to the restaurant you for
[1:10:56] excitement you go to a restaurant you
[1:10:58] want some spice you want some of the
[1:11:02] Exotic I know the woman I mean the
[1:11:05] sisters that go there just for salad why
[1:11:10] bother but you know believer shouldn't
[1:11:13] be that that way when God provided the
[1:11:17] food it doesn't just try to change the
[1:11:19] the flavor to catering you the nutrient
[1:11:22] that everything still the same he give
[1:11:25] it to you you eat it no matter which
[1:11:28] part of it you eat it no matter what
[1:11:30] flavor of it you eat it because it's
[1:11:33] good for
[1:11:34] you but as the time goes
[1:11:37] on no matter what church you go to no
[1:11:40] matter how wonderful your pastor is no
[1:11:42] matter how wonderful word that you heard
[1:11:44] people want to hear something something
[1:11:47] different they want to taste different
[1:11:50] they want an excitement you wanted
[1:11:52] something that more exotic that's how
[1:11:55] people start to Falling it
[1:12:02] way and that the Bible in the Book of
[1:12:05] Numbers chapter
[1:12:07] 21 it said to those
[1:12:13] people when it start a murmur start to
[1:12:16] complain then God sended a serpent the
[1:12:20] fiery serpents and it amongst them then
[1:12:23] when a when the fiery serpent start to
[1:12:25] biting them how that happens people lose
[1:12:30] focus people become
[1:12:32] aboring people start to finding
[1:12:35] something new then God sended a fiery
[1:12:39] serpent start to biting
[1:12:41] them I think it's behooved to us to let
[1:12:44] us
[1:12:45] refocus refocus on the right thing you
[1:12:49] said the things that doesn't happen keep
[1:12:50] on looking at the right thing when
[1:12:53] things is right when God has indic it
[1:12:55] when God has a give it or to prove it
[1:12:58] that's behoove to us to look at what God
[1:13:00] has to prove to vindicate it or to be
[1:13:02] the
[1:13:05] truth and one of fiery serpent was
[1:13:08] sending it into them and then we find
[1:13:10] out the
[1:13:12] people and there been hundreds of
[1:13:15] thousands of the people start to Ding
[1:13:18] and because of the fire serpent was was
[1:13:20] abiding them and then but even in that
[1:13:23] condition but God has a full of Mercy
[1:13:27] that he given him a
[1:13:29] remedy and he give or given him a cure
[1:13:32] for it and the Cure is lift up of a pole
[1:13:36] and put a breast serpent on it and the
[1:13:40] people who look at to the the bre
[1:13:42] Serpent and they can be
[1:13:45] healed you know you can't stop the the
[1:13:48] serpent to
[1:13:50] bite because when God sented the serpent
[1:13:53] amongst them
[1:13:55] no matter how you try to avoid it will
[1:13:57] bite
[1:13:58] them but God put a remedy give it to
[1:14:02] them let me put it in this way you can't
[1:14:05] stop the sickness to bite
[1:14:08] you no matter how healthy you are no
[1:14:11] matter how wonderful body that you've
[1:14:14] been built sooner or later you will get
[1:14:17] sick you're young people you might not
[1:14:20] feel that but when you're getting about
[1:14:21] five years or 10 years and you will
[1:14:24] start to feel the weakening of the body
[1:14:26] start to get on you and I'm
[1:14:29] 53 and I feel that's uh each uh well not
[1:14:33] not that yet each day not each day yet
[1:14:36] but each year passing or a few months of
[1:14:39] the the passing I feel some aching start
[1:14:41] to coming and it's coming on your body
[1:14:45] and I start to I start to relate it more
[1:14:47] have more sympathy to my dead and I
[1:14:50] started more sympathy to the older older
[1:14:53] people because of the older you get and
[1:14:56] the more sickness you're easy to get
[1:14:59] sick and it it just curs the body that
[1:15:02] we're living in you can't stop that the
[1:15:04] serpent to bite you no matter how you
[1:15:07] try to take care of your body no matter
[1:15:10] how you try to eat a salad every day and
[1:15:12] if sooner or later it will get on
[1:15:15] you and then I heard some people well
[1:15:17] that me just a just drink eat and drink
[1:15:20] uh uh cuz tomorrow I die because they
[1:15:23] let me just have a burger every day I
[1:15:25] just uh uh CU we're going to we're going
[1:15:27] to go to that way uh anyway I won't go
[1:15:30] down that but there was some people said
[1:15:32] idea you find out and the longer that
[1:15:35] we're living on this body is um um
[1:15:41] subject to uh to the attack that in this
[1:15:44] uh uh whatever sickness or or or things
[1:15:47] that in this
[1:15:49] world and no matter how you try to avoid
[1:15:52] a trial the trial will get on you
[1:15:56] no matter how you try to avoid a hurt
[1:15:59] the hurt will bite
[1:16:01] you there was a many things that we find
[1:16:04] out that on this Earth no matter how you
[1:16:07] try to escape sooner or later as the
[1:16:10] time goes on it will start to bite you
[1:16:13] you can't stop the the the biting of the
[1:16:16] the serpent but God provides a remedy
[1:16:20] for
[1:16:23] it and when God provided a remedy it was
[1:16:27] just a simple
[1:16:28] remedy it was just a lift out of the
[1:16:30] pole and put a breast serpent on it and
[1:16:33] people who look at it they can be
[1:16:37] healed it's not of people run to it it's
[1:16:40] not the people crawling to it but is the
[1:16:44] people who look at that breast of the
[1:16:46] serpent that means that the sickness has
[1:16:48] been judged the sin has been judged the
[1:16:51] hurt has been judged the complaint has
[1:16:54] been Jud judged everything that has been
[1:16:57] judged and when the people they look at
[1:17:00] that then they can be
[1:17:09] healed let's dramatize this a little
[1:17:13] bit and one of the
[1:17:16] people one the people got to bite to bed
[1:17:18] a
[1:17:19] serpent and that
[1:17:22] they they they can feel that the death
[1:17:25] start to get into uh their bloodstream
[1:17:29] start to going to their brain they start
[1:17:31] to losing their vision and their their
[1:17:34] Vision start to getting blur their body
[1:17:36] start to getting
[1:17:38] weakened but then because there is a
[1:17:42] breast of serpent that was erased up in
[1:17:45] amongst the camp and that the person and
[1:17:49] according to the prophets commandment if
[1:17:52] he just look that serpent that he can be
[1:17:57] healed and maybe when it first look at
[1:18:00] it it seems like nothing happened but as
[1:18:03] he keep on looking that then his vision
[1:18:06] started getting better the bloodstream
[1:18:09] started getting the the the poison that
[1:18:12] in the in the in the blood start to
[1:18:14] disting that stren start to getting back
[1:18:18] on him and then it start to get his body
[1:18:22] recovered and I was thinking what a
[1:18:24] testimony that was and that that young
[1:18:27] man or an older man and he started to
[1:18:30] testify that it to the people he said
[1:18:33] when they look at that Serpent and did
[1:18:35] the believe or not what a prophet has
[1:18:38] said was absolutely the truth when we
[1:18:40] look at the message when we look at the
[1:18:43] word that Jesus has paid the price for
[1:18:46] me and my sickness was healed and that
[1:18:49] the her was of was a healed and my way
[1:18:51] were children that come back to life go
[1:18:54] come back to the to the seaold again
[1:18:57] what a testimony that is and that
[1:19:00] encouraged in many other people they
[1:19:03] keep on looking they keep on looking and
[1:19:05] one after another one after another and
[1:19:08] the people got healed what a Revival
[1:19:10] that it caused though there is a there
[1:19:12] is a condemnation because they have
[1:19:15] complain and murmur because they do the
[1:19:18] things that that is a wrong but God
[1:19:19] given them a remedy and then what a
[1:19:22] remedy give it to them they to prove
[1:19:24] that it work and testimony after
[1:19:27] testimony and they start to to the
[1:19:29] coming people got very excited and there
[1:19:32] the more more people as I said you can't
[1:19:34] stop that the serpent to bite you don't
[1:19:36] know one that to strike you don't know
[1:19:38] one is that come to your family but God
[1:19:40] provided a remedy for
[1:19:42] us that are people that look that they
[1:19:45] can
[1:19:47] live as time goes
[1:19:51] on you know when they look at that
[1:19:56] people start to getting
[1:19:58] boring people start to getting uh
[1:20:02] said maybe they're sharing their
[1:20:04] testimony a little bit of the
[1:20:07] difference and one man and who was bite
[1:20:11] by The
[1:20:12] Serpent and he was almost going to
[1:20:16] die then he look at the
[1:20:18] pole then he seemingly doesn't work but
[1:20:23] that man become a
[1:20:26] desperate he start to
[1:20:28] running but as he
[1:20:30] run his weak his um body start to
[1:20:34] failing him his strength started to gone
[1:20:38] that he's crawling and his crawling but
[1:20:42] in his heart he was a
[1:20:43] desperate he said I must get to that the
[1:20:48] pole I must to get to that breast
[1:20:50] serpent because of that's my sin was
[1:20:53] judged my sickness was a judged and his
[1:20:57] was a crawling his a crawling his a
[1:21:00] strength is a failling him but finally
[1:21:04] he get to that pole and he embrace
[1:21:07] it and he look
[1:21:10] up and then he saw his vision start to
[1:21:13] come back to him he start to his as the
[1:21:16] Blood start to flow in it again and his
[1:21:19] biting started fading away
[1:21:26] and this man started sharing
[1:21:29] testimony he come to even in light
[1:21:32] Tabernacle he said you know what
[1:21:35] Brother The Prophet's word says
[1:21:37] absolutely the
[1:21:39] truth the word is

[1:25:21] your situation what is the word of a God
[1:25:23] has give it to
[1:25:26] you you know the pool was in the middle
[1:25:30] of the
[1:25:31] camp and is race it high so that
[1:25:35] everybody can look and
[1:25:38] live everybody can look at when he
[1:25:42] lifted it up it would draw all men unto
[1:25:45] me Jesus
[1:25:47] said some people might be very
[1:25:52] far they look at a pole
[1:25:56] when it bites by the
[1:25:58] serpent am I
[1:25:59] thinking that's too
[1:26:03] far it seems like for me to get back to
[1:26:07] the house of God just too
[1:26:10] far it seems like to me in my situation
[1:26:12] just so far
[1:26:15] gone I don't even know
[1:26:17] how how my life can be
[1:26:20] transformed I've been boring in a
[1:26:22] message I've been sitting in a in the to
[1:26:25] but you know what I never met
[1:26:31] God though the pole was
[1:26:34] Far maybe some people was close to the
[1:26:37] pole they still have to
[1:26:39] look no matter how they touch how they
[1:26:42] fail how they do whatever that they try
[1:26:44] to do they still have to look up but no
[1:26:47] matter how far they way it's not that a
[1:26:50] detail of what is the end that poll and
[1:26:53] saying they vary all the Inc all the
[1:26:57] craving carving all the no even that far
[1:27:02] you can't see the detail of it even it's
[1:27:05] that's so far away you can't even see
[1:27:07] clear of it but as long as you move your
[1:27:11] focus on that direction where the
[1:27:13] serpent has been judged sin has been
[1:27:16] judged sin has no domaining on you when
[1:27:19] you look at that you might not have the
[1:27:21] Seven Seals of Revelation yet you might
[1:27:24] to know exactly what is the how is it
[1:27:26] going to be but as long as you believe
[1:27:28] it and your sickness will be healed your
[1:27:32] back siding will be healed and your we
[1:27:34] word will be
[1:27:36] healed no matter how bite the serpent
[1:27:39] has been biting you but as long as you
[1:27:42] look into
[1:27:43] that you can be
[1:27:47] healed and that healing is not only one
[1:27:51] time is not when you've been bite one
[1:27:54] time then you got an immune system and
[1:27:57] start to kick in it's the time after
[1:27:59] time when you were bitten and the time
[1:28:02] after time you will look at it's not
[1:28:05] because you look at it one time you got
[1:28:07] immune system and build up and next time
[1:28:09] the serpent doesn't bother you every
[1:28:11] time the preacher can be
[1:28:13] bite and the spiritual man can be bitten
[1:28:17] time after time but time after time they
[1:28:19] have to look back to the word of God
[1:28:21] said to look and live whatever the word
[1:28:23] of God God has said I look to
[1:28:26] that it's not because we're preacher to
[1:28:28] we build up immune system and everything
[1:28:30] that we can resist and automatically
[1:28:32] every time we have to look into the word
[1:28:35] every time we look at it the serpent has
[1:28:38] been
[1:28:45] judged is to believe every word of a god
[1:28:48] Set to be the
[1:28:51] truth as I said that you can't stop to
[1:28:54] the B the serpent to
[1:28:56] bite brother said it in the blind berus
[1:29:00] had talk about the little
[1:29:02] Moses and I heard his parents I have to
[1:29:05] put him into the buket and then send him
[1:29:08] to a river of Nile was all the
[1:29:11] crocodiles and and everything and he
[1:29:13] said it's just like a breast serpent why
[1:29:16] the serpent didn't have no virtue in
[1:29:18] it he said it was a piece of a breast
[1:29:22] and they brought it up out of E
[1:29:25] Egypt and nether the pole have any
[1:29:28] virtue in it not a bit but it was
[1:29:32] obeying what God Said do what brought
[1:29:36] the power what brought the virtue is
[1:29:38] obedience to the word of God but you
[1:29:42] know as the time goes on even the come
[1:29:45] to the time that breast serpent people
[1:29:48] start to burn incense to
[1:29:51] it instead of a just a look and live
[1:29:54] live people always feel that we needed
[1:29:56] to put something into it we always have
[1:29:59] to do something and to put out our idea
[1:30:02] put our way our thinking of toward to it
[1:30:05] he said look it's too simple why don't
[1:30:07] we just burn incense that shows more
[1:30:09] sincerity that we
[1:30:11] have but God said no it's not to burn in
[1:30:15] an incense you can burn incense to many
[1:30:19] things to your own idea to your own
[1:30:21] thinking it might work it as one time
[1:30:24] but if you keep on keep on just as I
[1:30:27] said the people start to burning ancest
[1:30:29] to their own oh I this is done this is
[1:30:32] good for me I I craw I climbed I do
[1:30:34] everything that that I do but if you
[1:30:37] forgot that that the last the look and
[1:30:40] live you still won't be
[1:30:47] healed brother BMA said in the power of
[1:30:50] a devil he said how that it go into the
[1:30:52] river he talking about Moses
[1:30:54] that he take the little ones that have
[1:30:55] throw him in a river and then notice
[1:30:58] that that's the end of Satan's domain
[1:31:01] his domain can only come that far to the
[1:31:04] river and then his power is cut
[1:31:09] off it said it is that Satan has the
[1:31:12] power over death but thanks be
[1:31:17] to thanks be to the
[1:31:21] Living God who has the power of a
[1:31:27] resurrection he said beyond the shadow
[1:31:29] of the death he said what a Marvel thing
[1:31:32] it
[1:31:36] is and he said his domain can only come
[1:31:39] that far to the
[1:31:41] river then his power is cut
[1:31:46] off Satan can throw you into
[1:31:50] sickness but he is not the one
[1:31:53] determined
[1:31:54] the outcome of
[1:31:55] it Satan can throw your loved ones into
[1:32:00] a chaotic condition or send them the
[1:32:04] backslide to the world but Satan cannot
[1:32:08] determin the final outcome of
[1:32:12] it you have more control than he
[1:32:19] does Satan can throw the Hebrew children
[1:32:23] into the fiery
[1:32:25] furnace but he can't control the outcome
[1:32:28] of
[1:32:29] it is it a God himself and like a son
[1:32:34] son of a God that a forc man start to
[1:32:37] walk in the fiery
[1:32:39] furnace that fan off the power of the
[1:32:44] flame Satan doesn't control it but you
[1:32:48] control it Satan maybe put you into trou
[1:32:54] put you into difficult put you into the
[1:32:57] things that you probably never would
[1:32:59] think that will get out upon
[1:33:01] you but you control the outcome of it by
[1:33:06] faith believing the the word you have
[1:33:08] more control than Satan has
[1:33:12] do the reason is you don't belong to
[1:33:16] him you belongs to
[1:33:20] God if you belongs to him he has the
[1:33:22] more control he can do whatever he can
[1:33:25] do he wants to do but because uh you're
[1:33:27] not belonging to him so he has no claim
[1:33:31] among
[1:33:33] you Jesus said in the John 14
[1:33:38] and3 just before Jesus was uh a was
[1:33:43] nailed on on the cross he was a taken
[1:33:45] away from the disciples he said here
[1:33:48] after I will not talk much with you he
[1:33:52] said for the prin of this world cometh
[1:33:56] and he has nothing in me let me read
[1:34:00] that another translation of
[1:34:02] it and he said I will not talk with you
[1:34:05] much more for the prince The Evil Genius
[1:34:09] the ruler of the world is coming and he
[1:34:12] has no claim on
[1:34:15] me he has nothing in common with
[1:34:19] me there is a nothing in me that belong
[1:34:23] belongs to him and he has no power over
[1:34:30] me when I look at that I saw how
[1:34:33] marvelous that is that's not only talk
[1:34:36] about a Jesus but that's a you and me
[1:34:39] too because you are the genin of
[1:34:44] God and if Jesus if he said the prince
[1:34:47] of this the world to come and he has
[1:34:50] nothing in me or he has no claim on on
[1:34:53] me and I'll see when a prince of this
[1:34:57] world though he still on this Earth but
[1:34:59] he has no claim on you and on me either
[1:35:03] he has nothing in common with me and
[1:35:06] I'll say yes he has nothing in common
[1:35:08] with me and I have everything in common
[1:35:11] with God inside of my inside the Gin is
[1:35:15] not of my own father it's a mothers but
[1:35:18] the Gin was coming from God himself and
[1:35:21] that because of of my soul and I was
[1:35:24] born again you were born again that gen
[1:35:27] was coming from God so Satan has no
[1:35:31] claim on you Satan has cannot claim your
[1:35:34] soul because that Soul doesn't belongs
[1:35:37] to them that Soul belongs to God
[1:35:41] himself and they said that there's
[1:35:43] nothing common there there he has
[1:35:47] nothing in common with me you said oh in
[1:35:50] my body and I I this body body doesn't
[1:35:54] belongs to Satan this body belongs to
[1:35:58] God Satan only perverts this body but
[1:36:02] original owner is a still God any one
[1:36:06] day and when I received the word and
[1:36:08] something changed the inside of me
[1:36:11] though on the outside hasn't been
[1:36:12] changed but because of the inside has
[1:36:15] been changed so is's working from the
[1:36:17] inside out it had taking control of my
[1:36:20] spirit and it would taking control of my
[1:36:22] body that the body to be subjected to
[1:36:24] the word of God Satan has no claim on
[1:36:28] this body even I died but God is an
[1:36:31] original owner well one day will change
[1:36:34] his body in an incorruptable
[1:36:40] form so just like it the Christ the life
[1:36:44] that the inside of him and it doesn't
[1:36:45] belongs to the Satan the life the inside
[1:36:48] of you and me doesn't belong to the
[1:36:50] Satan Nei it belongs to God himself and
[1:36:54] he cannot claim what is rightfully
[1:36:56] belongs to
[1:37:00] God and Satan since the power was
[1:37:04] limited as I said he can throw into the
[1:37:07] sickness and into the trial but it
[1:37:08] cannot determine the outcome of it and
[1:37:12] Satan in another word he was
[1:37:14] abound he was abound by the power of God
[1:37:19] and God only allowed him to go certain
[1:37:22] distance he can only go so
[1:37:27] far Satan is not annihilated
[1:37:31] yet in one day in in future he will be
[1:37:34] annihilated he will be thrown into the
[1:37:36] lake of a fire he will be completed to
[1:37:38] become a nothing but right now he's only
[1:37:42] bound he's not
[1:37:45] annihilated he was AB bound because sin
[1:37:49] has been judged in the Book of Romans
[1:37:51] chapter 83 says for what the law could
[1:37:55] not do in that it was a weak through the
[1:37:57] flesh God sending his own son in the
[1:38:01] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[1:38:04] condemned the sin in the flesh and the
[1:38:07] the sin was condemned not because of
[1:38:10] that because of Jesus and so if if I can
[1:38:14] say in this way then Satan the Devil is
[1:38:18] being condemned is being judged though
[1:38:22] he was not annihilated but he has been
[1:38:26] condemned the things that has to bother
[1:38:28] you has been condemned has been
[1:38:32] judged have you go to the court probably
[1:38:35] most of you don't that's
[1:38:39] good I never been there but I saw some
[1:38:42] uh uh some of the court and when they go
[1:38:45] to the court and the the person who was
[1:38:49] a condemned or judged or like a criminal
[1:38:52] they put a handcuffed on him and they
[1:38:55] they take him better the sheriff and to
[1:38:57] the court and waiting for it is a
[1:39:00] verdict to be sentenced and when it is
[1:39:03] the verdict was a pass sentence to jail
[1:39:06] or sentence to uh execute
[1:39:09] it the execution doesn't happen they're
[1:39:12] right out of court there and then go to
[1:39:15] the prison still have a distance he has
[1:39:17] to be taken away and there's a there's a
[1:39:20] time that he go into the prison still
[1:39:23] other period of a time but the one that
[1:39:25] aord he was a
[1:39:27] handcuffed he he was a deprived of his
[1:39:30] the freedom he cannot just move freely
[1:39:33] as much as he didn't want that person
[1:39:37] may be threatening to the person on the
[1:39:40] witness um desk that per that criminal
[1:39:44] may be uh threatening with his word I
[1:39:47] tried to shake shaking his feet and to
[1:39:50] do everything he can but he was deprived
[1:39:52] of his Freedom though his a Conant is
[1:39:55] still fears and he's hate full of hatred
[1:39:59] but he cannot have a full power to do
[1:40:01] what he want to do the only thing that
[1:40:04] he can do he might curse you he might
[1:40:06] say bad word about you but he doesn't
[1:40:09] possess any real power to do that
[1:40:11] because he was a
[1:40:14] judged and I say Satan has been judged
[1:40:18] Satan has been bound because of Jesus
[1:40:21] Christ has already paid a price for the
[1:40:24] sin he condemned the sin in his flesh he
[1:40:29] judged the sin in his flesh so that sin
[1:40:32] will have no domination upon you he has
[1:40:36] no Dominion on you you don't have to
[1:40:38] leave Unholy life you don't have to live
[1:40:41] a pretended hypocrisy life you can put
[1:40:45] your foot on his neck that the sin has
[1:40:48] been judged Satan might accuse you he
[1:40:51] might condemn you and said you did this
[1:40:53] and you did that but the blood of Christ
[1:40:56] hasn't paid all the price for
[1:40:58] me because the sin has been
[1:41:06] judged so he was a deprived from his
[1:41:09] freedom he couldn't do anything that he
[1:41:16] wanted he was a
[1:41:18] bound he was a
[1:41:20] handcuffed let me bring you another
[1:41:22] point of
[1:41:24] here he was not fully
[1:41:28] annihilated but in the future yes he
[1:41:31] will be but right now he was a
[1:41:35] bind and the time that the time that we
[1:41:37] said we bind the devil you don't bind
[1:41:40] the devil just by Your
[1:41:42] Word you bind the Devil by your
[1:41:46] life brother BR said in a Christian and
[1:41:48] an
[1:41:49] answer he would talk about in the
[1:41:52] millennium he said Satan was
[1:41:55] bound but what he was bound he but he
[1:41:58] was bound he said A Thousand Years Satan
[1:42:01] was a loose out of his prison that is
[1:42:03] abound by an Angel with a chin not a
[1:42:07] lock chin but a chin of
[1:42:11] circumstances it's not that the Satan
[1:42:13] was abound just by a chin and tried to
[1:42:16] Chin hand cover him him up so it's not
[1:42:19] that you bind it up just by Your Word by
[1:42:21] your It Is by Your Word
[1:42:24] but it's a life of the inside which your
[1:42:26] word has confessed and match up with
[1:42:28] what is on the inside it's a displaying
[1:42:31] that a token that Satan will recognize
[1:42:34] that is a displaying of your life that
[1:42:37] Satan will recognize that but bre said
[1:42:40] he said he said about a chain of the
[1:42:43] circumstances of all of his subject was
[1:42:45] in hell and all that was resurrected on
[1:42:48] Earth was redeemed and Jesus wisdom he
[1:42:51] couldn't work on nothing the reason that
[1:42:54] Satan was abounded in the Millennium
[1:42:56] because there's no unbelievers over
[1:42:58] there he cannot work on the unbelief he
[1:43:03] the only way that he can be Unbound is
[1:43:07] if there's unbelief in there that he can
[1:43:10] have something that Satan can work with
[1:43:13] but if you believe there's nothing
[1:43:15] inside of you that he can work with he
[1:43:19] can work on believer he can work on
[1:43:22] unbeliever
[1:43:23] but if when you have a faith when you
[1:43:25] look and live when you've been born
[1:43:28] again when there's a new life living in
[1:43:30] you Satan was bind by the
[1:43:34] circumstances brother BR said that the
[1:43:36] church that's on Earth is redeemed and
[1:43:39] to right in the presence of a
[1:43:42] Christ so he has nothing he can work on
[1:43:47] so it's not a chain as I said a lot
[1:43:49] chain it's a chain of circumstances
[1:43:53] he has nothing he can do he is helpless
[1:43:56] and hopeless think of what a position
[1:44:00] that you are in my brother and my
[1:44:01] sisters is not how loud we can shout to
[1:44:05] to bite him to cuss him to cast him out
[1:44:08] it's the life that inside of you if
[1:44:11] Jesus has to said that the prince of the
[1:44:13] world has to come but he has nothing in
[1:44:16] me he can't claim anything in me it Ain
[1:44:19] I what in myself there's no unbelief no
[1:44:23] unbel that the Satan can come can work
[1:44:26] with can clim this is mine you know the
[1:44:29] Satan can come to you and with a smoke
[1:44:32] and with a drink with a drug and things
[1:44:34] but when he come he find out there's
[1:44:36] nothing no desire in there why God has
[1:44:40] to change you he can't claim nothing he
[1:44:44] can't work on nothing has no power to
[1:44:47] work on because the circumstances has a
[1:44:50] CH him you that I've been born again
[1:44:54] that inside of you there's a different
[1:44:57] life in there that bind
[1:45:00] Satan he tried to influence you he try
[1:45:03] to do everything that he can but it's
[1:45:05] nothing that he can work
[1:45:08] with then he become a helpless and a
[1:45:15] hopeless but said in the chist Myster of
[1:45:18] God reveal he said that Christ is the
[1:45:20] living through you so pregnant which is
[1:45:24] a spirit that you are a prisoner to
[1:45:28] anything else you are
[1:45:31] confined to the gospel confined to the
[1:45:35] word word uh word and all the children
[1:45:38] that you can bring forth is
[1:45:41] that he said because you are a prisoner
[1:45:45] you can't commit adultery you are
[1:45:48] already pregnant Glory he can take a
[1:45:52] hold the womb of alive is a closed to
[1:45:56] anything else you are already his by
[1:46:01] predestination the seed has come to life
[1:46:05] no world can get in when you receive the
[1:46:09] seed word of God that seed is the inside
[1:46:12] of you and you're responding to the word
[1:46:15] then the womb was closed and nothing
[1:46:18] else can get in there and brother BR
[1:46:21] said as as soon as of the life giving
[1:46:23] flow that seed laying there other seed
[1:46:26] that just would come in wouldn't take a
[1:46:30] hold just couldn't do it why they
[1:46:34] couldn't do it it doesn't say that outer
[1:46:36] seed don't want to come in they will try
[1:46:38] all their best try to come into you but
[1:46:41] when you receive the the word that Faith
[1:46:44] whom has reive the word then the womb
[1:46:47] was closed though they outer SE they
[1:46:50] tried to to get in but because of the
[1:46:53] womb was closed there the seed from the
[1:46:56] outside couldn't get in you are changed
[1:46:59] when you receive the word in this hour
[1:47:03] and it when by faith you receive it and
[1:47:05] your life changed and that shows it's
[1:47:08] not you live anymore but Christ are
[1:47:10] living inside of you though the
[1:47:12] influence of the world try to come he
[1:47:14] will not go in there though the devil
[1:47:16] try to put a trick and put it on your
[1:47:18] trap try to set a trap for you but he
[1:47:21] couldn't do that why because it he was
[1:47:24] abound by the
[1:47:26] circumstances inside of you there's
[1:47:29] another life living in
[1:47:33] there so Satan cannot come in to claim
[1:47:37] anything that belongs to him because you
[1:47:40] were born again there's a different life
[1:47:43] living in you and he can come claim
[1:47:46] temper but it's not in
[1:47:49] there I know when I said that some
[1:47:52] people said
[1:47:57] it won't take a
[1:47:58] hold if there was a real believer when
[1:48:02] there is something they do wrong right
[1:48:05] away Lord forgive me that bleach is
[1:48:09] still there that blood is still
[1:48:15] there so Satan cannot come to claim
[1:48:18] anything that rightfully belongs to
[1:48:21] him but there's one can claim
[1:48:25] you God can claim
[1:48:27] you because inside of you there's a soul
[1:48:33] and that's a g of God that's a
[1:48:36] rightfully belongs to God
[1:48:39] himself Satan couldn't claim it Satan
[1:48:43] might put things on
[1:48:45] you but you never lost that the life
[1:48:49] that God had to put it in there before
[1:48:52] the foundation
[1:48:53] of the
[1:48:55] world the Bible talk about the prodical
[1:48:59] son though he is a prodal but he's a
[1:49:02] still
[1:49:04] son he's a son
[1:49:07] forever sometime you feel you might be
[1:49:11] like a
[1:49:12] prodal but still the sunship never
[1:49:16] lost the sunship still inside of you the
[1:49:20] prodal might be in the peak pan but a
[1:49:23] sunship never lost he's a still son that
[1:49:27] a born in the
[1:49:29] family just one day that prodical son
[1:49:34] wake
[1:49:36] up why he can wake up why not other son
[1:49:39] we
[1:49:40] C because he's coming from the father's
[1:49:44] house the boss of the prodical son never
[1:49:46] wake up the colleague of the prodical
[1:49:49] son never wake up but a prodical son
[1:49:52] wake up
[1:49:53] and the angel brother BR was a tap on
[1:49:55] his shoulder said it's time to go
[1:49:58] home and when that tap is his s that
[1:50:02] prodical son start to get back
[1:50:06] home when a son get back
[1:50:09] home the father put a robe on him put a
[1:50:14] band on him and put a shoes around him
[1:50:20] he's a Ste a
[1:50:21] son he never lost his sunship how the
[1:50:25] father prove that he never lost it he
[1:50:28] gave it what is rightfully belongs to a
[1:50:30] son the slave never wear shoes but the
[1:50:33] son wear shoes the slave never world
[1:50:36] that unmerited grace of God that the
[1:50:39] band that had put on his finger but the
[1:50:40] son would do and that the robe that was
[1:50:44] still put on the
[1:50:46] sun it in our way we're thinking he need
[1:50:49] to take a
[1:50:51] shower before you put a robe on him but
[1:50:55] the father never let him take a
[1:50:57] shower the way to receive a son is not
[1:51:01] to you got to clean up first the way to
[1:51:03] receive the son give him a more give him
[1:51:06] more grace give him a more robe give it
[1:51:09] them more the gospel that shot as a shoe
[1:51:12] give it them more unmerited the wedding
[1:51:14] bner that they give it to them it's not
[1:51:17] to take a shower clean up clip your nail
[1:51:19] then we can put the Rob on him it's the
[1:51:22] f hard when a son is a prodigal but when
[1:51:25] a prodigal coming home he said I will
[1:51:28] give you my robe over righteousness I
[1:51:30] will give you the grace that you are not
[1:51:33] merited all father's want the brother B
[1:51:37] said all father's want just want a son
[1:51:39] to come home and a father would take
[1:51:42] care of the rest of
[1:51:44] of you might be in the prodical station
[1:51:47] stage you said oh I I Bor in a m you
[1:51:50] might be in that prodical sense stage
[1:51:53] even sitting in a peo but your mind and
[1:51:55] is somewhere else and your life is not a
[1:51:58] cul of the wiard is not trying to like
[1:52:00] oh I you try to clean up you try to quit
[1:52:02] this you receive the word the father
[1:52:06] only wanted one thing that done to you
[1:52:08] it's said I put out my robe of
[1:52:10] righteousness is on you put under my
[1:52:14] grace that you are not IMM merited along
[1:52:16] you it's not to try to give it an excuse
[1:52:19] for the sin but in order to get rid of
[1:52:22] all of that it's like God's own life
[1:52:24] living inside of you pray look and
[1:52:30] live when you look you can
[1:52:46] live and Jes and he cares to do you care
[1:52:51] brother BR talking about other
[1:52:53] Legion and he was uh possessed of
[1:52:57] thousands of
[1:52:59] demons brother BR said he care when a
[1:53:02] neurotic called Legion carrying not
[1:53:06] under opposition to we go out from under
[1:53:09] those
[1:53:10] Tombstone of the devils and to go out to
[1:53:13] meet
[1:53:14] Jesus and throw himself prostrate one
[1:53:19] Legion them Devils of would have never
[1:53:22] come
[1:53:23] if Legion hadn't have a pushes way out
[1:53:26] there to meet him and why he car enough
[1:53:29] to make that
[1:53:31] effort that stand in his belief Jesus
[1:53:35] car enough to cast out this religion of
[1:53:38] the Devils from
[1:53:41] him that Legion has to make a
[1:53:45] move though as the thousands of a devil
[1:53:49] has a possess of this
[1:53:51] Allegiance and that seems like it was a
[1:53:54] fully controlled by all the demon power
[1:53:58] but that Legion still possessed that a
[1:54:00] power he can move out of the
[1:54:05] Tomb because the inside of that allegion
[1:54:08] there's a predestinated seed is in there
[1:54:12] no matter how outward appears it maybe
[1:54:15] seems like completely hopeless and
[1:54:18] helpless but inside there there's a gene
[1:54:21] that belongs to
[1:54:23] God and though de demon possessed him
[1:54:27] even when that Legion come out of the
[1:54:30] Tomb he still bris it out the curse he
[1:54:33] still bris it out just like that a demon
[1:54:36] power has was a talk he said are he said
[1:54:40] are you coming he said our time is is
[1:54:42] not here yet he said you come to torture
[1:54:45] us but inside of that there's a gene
[1:54:48] that's a predestinated by God thousand
[1:54:52] thousand of a demon cannot hold him
[1:54:55] thousands of those demon the fils a
[1:54:58] demon the pornography demon and all
[1:55:00] those are demon the lust of the demon
[1:55:03] the hypocrisy demon the depression demon
[1:55:07] the bitterness demon all those demon
[1:55:11] though has to possess them and drive him
[1:55:13] to the tomb but those demon cannot hold
[1:55:19] the G inside of that Legion
[1:55:23] the legion still possessed inside of him
[1:55:27] there's a power when she when he
[1:55:31] recognized that his original owner has a
[1:55:36] coming to him Jesus said Jesus heard a
[1:55:41] soul that was a cry when Jesus heard our
[1:55:45] soul cry that predestinated the SE that
[1:55:48] was a crying inside of the Legion then
[1:55:51] Jesus cross the sea that you claim that
[1:55:56] Legion why because of that Legion on the
[1:55:59] outside the devil might claim every bit
[1:56:03] of it because it's done wrong but inside
[1:56:06] of that Soul devil cannot claim that but
[1:56:10] the original owner Christ can claim that
[1:56:14] Christ doesn't claim that the body
[1:56:17] doesn't claim it is his mind but Christ
[1:56:19] are coming to claim the gene that laid
[1:56:22] inside of
[1:56:24] him man on the outside of there are so
[1:56:27] many things has it wrapped them up but
[1:56:30] when Christ come that inside of that
[1:56:33] soul of that Legion he recognize my
[1:56:36] masters is here my original owner is a
[1:56:40] here my legal owner is a here on the
[1:56:44] outside of the squatter of a demon has a
[1:56:46] squatting on the land but an inside of
[1:56:49] an inside that he know there was a
[1:56:51] something doesn't belongs to that then
[1:56:54] the inside was a cry out and Jesus heard
[1:56:58] that and he come for that
[1:57:02] Legion and that Legion brother BR said
[1:57:05] he wiggle through out of the the
[1:57:09] tomb he said those demon would by no
[1:57:12] means that will come to meet Jesus they
[1:57:16] were
[1:57:17] run but inside of there there's a gin of
[1:57:21] God living in there think about what a
[1:57:24] power that a lady in that Legion don't
[1:57:28] say how weak that is but what a power
[1:57:31] lady in that
[1:57:32] Legion thousands of a devil cannot hold
[1:57:36] him
[1:57:37] down thousands of a demons cannot hold
[1:57:40] that g down thousands of a depression
[1:57:44] cannot hold that g down thousands of a
[1:57:47] backside cannot hold that J now that je
[1:57:51] right can said there is my master
[1:57:54] coming there is a real legal owner over
[1:57:57] me coming Satan squatted on landine
[1:58:01] Satan deprived of my peace Satan
[1:58:03] deprived of my joy Satan deprived of
[1:58:06] everything that I rightly owned but now
[1:58:10] I know my master is to comeing and he is
[1:58:13] an original
[1:58:14] [Applause]
[1:58:20] owner even as his own Gene cannot
[1:58:23] overcome that but when he called on
[1:58:27] him man hasn't heard that a voice but
[1:58:31] that g inside of him heard that crying
[1:58:35] out and Jesus heard that voice and he
[1:58:39] are coming for that
[1:58:41] allegion let me share a little testimony
[1:58:45] here just about two months
[1:58:48] ago and we went to a Philippines
[1:58:53] and to have a cuz we can we can't have a
[1:58:56] meeting in China I cannot go back I
[1:58:59] think I probably told or you heard that
[1:59:02] because of the Distributing of the Bible
[1:59:05] that the brothers are from China there
[1:59:06] was a for of them that was
[1:59:08] arrested and they was sent to jail and
[1:59:11] the longest would for two years almost
[1:59:14] two years and then they were released
[1:59:18] but during the
[1:59:19] trial I was a look at a
[1:59:22] because that's during the covid time and
[1:59:25] during that time nobody uh be in person
[1:59:27] to go to the court so but the they have
[1:59:30] the live broadcast of uh when the trials
[1:59:33] of the pass of the sentence to the
[1:59:34] brothers so that the family has the
[1:59:37] passcode and they give me the passcal so
[1:59:40] I can log in and I look at the trial
[1:59:42] when the brothers was uh ready to
[1:59:45] sentence you know when I saw those
[1:59:47] brother I I thought that's the hero of
[1:59:49] the faith and they stand standing there
[1:59:52] their head was completely shaved with
[1:59:54] their prison closes on them they
[1:59:56] standing to the uh the uh whatever
[2:00:00] defense offense whatever that and one
[2:00:03] they senten so they ask
[2:00:05] him said uh any of
[2:00:09] you he said Do you have do you have uh
[2:00:14] do you have anything that you can
[2:00:17] say against your uh the fellow
[2:00:22] prisoner because if you can say anything
[2:00:25] or uh I don't have the right word if you
[2:00:30] can say anything against them or or give
[2:00:32] some a secret or whatever then you can
[2:00:34] beave a lesser a lesser
[2:00:37] sentence and those Brothers said
[2:00:41] nothing there's nothing I can see about
[2:00:45] my uh my people I wish I can have the
[2:00:47] right word for it and they WR to go to
[2:00:50] jail in you know not to betrayal their
[2:00:54] own fellow
[2:00:57] prisoner and when I when they having
[2:00:59] that when of the lawyer defending for
[2:01:02] them and the prosecutor from the
[2:01:04] government said we arrested this for
[2:01:07] because they disputing of the Bible
[2:01:09] doing the illegal things but he said
[2:01:11] that an the mean one we haven't C him
[2:01:13] yet catch him yet and he said his name
[2:01:15] is Murphy one is in Canada when I heard
[2:01:18] that I know okay I probably won't be
[2:01:21] able to go back any
[2:01:24] anymore but you know the Lord has a way
[2:01:26] to do
[2:01:28] things if it was that I'll be still
[2:01:31] going back to China try to work with the
[2:01:33] brother we do the mission works but
[2:01:36] during those four years of time during
[2:01:38] of the co of 2020 until last year we
[2:01:41] finished all the 1200
[2:01:44] message and the in
[2:01:46] text and in out four years of a time I
[2:01:49] can really sit down and now we have a
[2:01:52] finished
[2:01:53] 1130 message in audio
[2:01:56] form and by God's grace next by February
[2:01:59] next month are we're going to finish all
[2:02:02] the audio
[2:02:03] translation I was thinking without that
[2:02:06] I this going to be prolong I don't know
[2:02:09] how many years but just in another a
[2:02:12] little less than four years of time
[2:02:15] actually less than two years of time we
[2:02:17] finished almost the 700 audio messages
[2:02:22] that's a one year and a half that's
[2:02:25] basically every day I need to record
[2:02:27] about a two
[2:02:29] message but if without that this cannot
[2:02:33] be done but because of that when you
[2:02:36] look at it back you saw the hands of a
[2:02:39] God all he need to do is just you yield
[2:02:44] yourself yield yourself Jesus has to
[2:02:48] said now the darkness has control
[2:02:52] he yield himself to The Darkness Be
[2:02:55] crucified on the cross then the
[2:02:57] resurrection can come your sin that it
[2:03:00] can be buried your uh your your sickness
[2:03:03] and your everything that he paid a price
[2:03:05] for it the darkness has it
[2:03:08] controled but God has had the great
[2:03:11] greatest Glory that
[2:03:13] ever and then so the brother said what
[2:03:17] we going to do I know just give me a
[2:03:20] five minutes I I'll try to write up and
[2:03:23] then just the brother said I'll come uh
[2:03:26] you know is there any way that we can
[2:03:27] meet because of my last trip there is
[2:03:31] 2018 and never being able to back sins
[2:03:34] and then the brother sister if possible
[2:03:37] these are any way that we can do this
[2:03:40] and then uh God put that in the brother
[2:03:42] Tom's heart he said brother Murphy have
[2:03:44] you ever thinking about the two go to
[2:03:47] Philippine and then just a few months
[2:03:49] later brother Vernon came from the
[2:03:51] Philippine then it came to our church
[2:03:53] then we asked if that's possible he said
[2:03:55] sure I'll arrange for it then the last
[2:03:58] year it will be the first time yeah
[2:03:59] actually it was the first time that it
[2:04:01] was a three brothers a brother Caleb a
[2:04:03] Brother David a brother R the all this
[2:04:05] pastor then the three of them they come
[2:04:07] to Philippine that we met at each other
[2:04:09] the first time and it was just marvelous
[2:04:12] that when we reunited together it was a
[2:04:15] very emotional
[2:04:17] time and then they asked if this year
[2:04:20] they said can we meet it again then I
[2:04:23] went to pray I said
[2:04:26] Lord though I miss them I have the
[2:04:29] emotionally tied with them but Lord I
[2:04:32] don't want to just base on emotional TI
[2:04:36] though as wonderful as it it it is but
[2:04:39] Lord unless this is the supernatural
[2:04:43] hand of a god leading I don't want to
[2:04:45] just go Philippine spend a thousand of
[2:04:48] dollars preach a few service and then
[2:04:50] meet to the brothers I said Lord never
[2:04:52] never be my be my goal or my that's in
[2:04:55] my heart I said Lord you have to show me
[2:04:59] and I prayed I prayed but I just lend to
[2:05:02] war to it you know did you have it come
[2:05:04] to the time you lend but you don't know
[2:05:06] what's going to happen so I I I just by
[2:05:10] by faith I said yes I I believe that's
[2:05:13] said Lord that that you leave me there
[2:05:14] so that the brothers they had a they
[2:05:18] they said brother Murphy there's a more
[2:05:20] people want to come this time
[2:05:22] and they they uh they calculated there
[2:05:25] was more than 50 60 I said no no no
[2:05:27] that's too dangerous I said I don't want
[2:05:29] that happen I said uh I said please uh
[2:05:32] limited a number so they actually they
[2:05:35] finally they only got about 18 young
[2:05:37] people that are from the different
[2:05:38] Church they're all coming over and uh
[2:05:41] you know you have to understand they
[2:05:42] have to spend the thousands of dollars
[2:05:45] and the buying a take care that they
[2:05:46] paid everything to the go there there
[2:05:48] are young people just like you they have
[2:05:49] a work in China there's no such a thing
[2:05:51] holiday holiday doesn't belongs to
[2:05:53] people holiday belongs to Americans
[2:05:56] they're just
[2:05:59] sorry they just work and work and work
[2:06:02] some people they have ask day off they
[2:06:04] said if you ask day off you don't have
[2:06:06] to come back you just go you're you're
[2:06:09] fired and they have to some people they
[2:06:11] have to do that but they said we want to
[2:06:14] do that you know when you want to pay
[2:06:16] the price you know we said God is a
[2:06:19] Jehovah
[2:06:20] jyra but do you know what is the Jehovah
[2:06:22] jar really mean
[2:06:25] Jehovah jarra means
[2:06:28] see when Jehovah
[2:06:30] see he's a Jehovah Gyra he's a Jehovah
[2:06:34] se but he must have see you move then
[2:06:38] he's a Jehovah Gyra he
[2:06:40] provides is a Jehovah when he saw
[2:06:43] Abraham and move then he become a
[2:06:45] Jehovah Gyra he provided the sacrifice I
[2:06:48] have the quotes for it but it was a
[2:06:50] Jehovah he has to see you you have to re
[2:06:54] willing to pay the price to put up the
[2:06:58] cause to make a move like that of the
[2:07:00] Legion he made out of that move they
[2:07:03] said if that's SP those demon that demon
[2:07:05] will by no means try to move it out but
[2:07:08] it's something inside of him he moved
[2:07:10] himself he crawling himself out of that
[2:07:13] tomb then Jesus claimed to him and those
[2:07:17] young people they came in it
[2:07:19] over and I when I saw them I just cannot
[2:07:23] help but cry cuz I know every one of
[2:07:25] them since they were a little baby but

[2:12:15] so then we have the meeting and while
[2:12:18] we're having while we're having another
[2:12:20] meeting
[2:12:22] and as the word was as a preaching and I
[2:12:25] was wonder if that word would do
[2:12:27] anything to that little young girl and I
[2:12:30] saw that the word has been moving and
[2:12:32] the Lord has been moving there was the
[2:12:34] people start to coming up there was a
[2:12:36] people that they just coming to the
[2:12:39] altar give their heart to the Lord and
[2:12:42] as a change to the person I just
[2:12:44] wondering what
[2:12:46] Lord where is the god of Elijah for that
[2:12:50] young girl and after the service is over
[2:12:53] and I was uh just uh coming back to the
[2:12:56] from of the pulpit and standing on the
[2:12:59] uh there and that the pastor already
[2:13:02] dismissed of the
[2:13:04] service and I as dismissed but something
[2:13:06] just in my heart I said Lord I don't
[2:13:09] feel this is over I don't feel this is
[2:13:12] over I was standing there and it was
[2:13:14] kind of awkward because of the pastor
[2:13:16] asked if we can go out just having a
[2:13:18] dinner together and and I just I just
[2:13:20] stand there I I did a move and while I
[2:13:24] was standing there I was just praying
[2:13:26] then there was a young man coming for us
[2:13:29] and as a young man said to brother
[2:13:30] Murphy I don't know why but something I
[2:13:32] almost feel like something lifted in my
[2:13:35] he said I'm not a spiritual person
[2:13:37] brother Murphy but something just almost
[2:13:39] feel lifted me up let me coming to to
[2:13:41] the front he said I want you I want you
[2:13:44] to pray for me I don't even know what
[2:13:46] you want what the Lord want you to pray
[2:13:48] for me and that young man was married
[2:13:51] just uh got married and I prayed to
[2:13:54] prayed to WID him and wisdom of the
[2:13:55] brothers and then later he said I want
[2:13:58] to uh we want to have a child and by
[2:14:01] God's grace and just one month ago and
[2:14:05] his wife who found a pregnant and then
[2:14:07] this is not only just the beginning and
[2:14:09] then one after another people start to
[2:14:12] coming all those are Chinese young
[2:14:14] people they coming from China sometime I
[2:14:16] wonder why God has to let people spend
[2:14:18] thousands of the dollars let people to
[2:14:20] go to their prisons do this and that but
[2:14:23] you know just for one person
[2:14:26] maybe and then I saw this young girl wew
[2:14:31] she came forth with a solemn face teared
[2:14:34] in his eye and as she coming up she said
[2:14:38] brother
[2:14:39] Murphy I said I believe the word has
[2:14:43] spoke to
[2:14:44] me but can you can you pray for
[2:14:48] me I said may you want to be
[2:14:53] delivered I said
[2:14:55] yes I said wait wait the god of Elijah
[2:14:59] is right
[2:15:03] here you have a right
[2:15:06] desire you don't want just
[2:15:10] Elijah you wanted the god of
[2:15:14] Elijah I said a way I believer right
[2:15:16] here you can meet
[2:15:18] him it was a quiet there's uh no music
[2:15:22] because the musician all left everyone
[2:15:24] is already left just a whole group of
[2:15:27] the Chinese young people over there and
[2:15:29] I lay hands whisper a m and a different
[2:15:31] one we lay hands on on
[2:15:33] her is not lightning no
[2:15:38] thundering sometime I even thinking
[2:15:42] Lord is that
[2:15:45] it is that
[2:15:48] it I know she uh shed the tears as she
[2:15:52] cried but I said
[2:15:55] Lord I I wish she can pounding at
[2:15:59] altar just something confirmed that
[2:16:03] she's been
[2:16:04] changed
[2:16:07] nothing that's the time you look and
[2:16:11] live that's the time you be certain over
[2:16:15] God that's right when you turn over
[2:16:17] every stone when he still doesn't speak
[2:16:21] right that's the time you be certain of
[2:16:25] God you look and live and commit it to
[2:16:29] the hand of the lord lord I believe the
[2:16:32] god of Elijah is here and I said that
[2:16:35] the god of Elijah is here and I know God
[2:16:38] of Elijah is here not because I failed
[2:16:41] it but I know he's here because he
[2:16:44] promised that two or three that get in
[2:16:47] his name when the word was preached when
[2:16:50] I know that's the word of God and I know
[2:16:53] you're going to M and we let her
[2:16:56] go and then afterward everybody is
[2:17:00] dismissed and uh while we're
[2:17:02] fellowshipping I just turned around I
[2:17:03] look at I saw her she pulled up with
[2:17:07] some of candy she give it out to the
[2:17:09] children and she started sitting down
[2:17:12] with the children started talking with
[2:17:13] the children and then after she talked
[2:17:16] with the children you know if the person
[2:17:18] was depressed the children don't get
[2:17:20] along there don't get around them
[2:17:23] because they want to make everybody
[2:17:25] depressed and the children but the
[2:17:27] children they were talking she was
[2:17:29] talking with them giving them a candy
[2:17:31] and after a little while she get her the
[2:17:34] person she never talked all those 18
[2:17:37] young people she never talk a word to
[2:17:39] any of them not even her her mom and dad
[2:17:42] and she started talking with those young
[2:17:45] people and then she started sharing her
[2:17:47] own testimony she never shared it before
[2:17:49] if she never shared it I wouldn't share
[2:17:51] this with you she talking about the how
[2:17:54] the the demon tried to let her depressed
[2:17:57] and the uh committed suicide she said
[2:18:00] but the Lord delivered me and she was a
[2:18:03] sharing with every oldest of the young
[2:18:05] people and she was praising the Lord
[2:18:08] raiseed up her hand give a god a Grace
[2:18:11] give a god a
[2:18:13] praise I
[2:18:14] said that girl
[2:18:17] changed in a moment of I love
[2:18:21] and
[2:18:22] live when you look she live when she
[2:18:26] look she lived and then she was a happy
[2:18:30] she was a smiling first time all this
[2:18:33] year I saw her
[2:18:34] smile her dad and watch her in the Maze
[2:18:38] doesn't know what's happened to my girl
[2:18:41] and then they went back to the little
[2:18:43] not a motel but like Airbnb that in a in
[2:18:46] a in a in a uh was a room it was a
[2:18:49] little house there was a C yard yard in
[2:18:52] there and they all went back she's still
[2:18:55] talking she's still witnessing she's
[2:18:57] still talking how the Lord had do the
[2:18:59] wonderful things to
[2:19:00] her and while she they were talking she
[2:19:03] was just in the courtyard there she was
[2:19:05] talking with a little one sister or two
[2:19:07] sister then before we know everybody
[2:19:10] started coming out and all those young
[2:19:13] people and The Wizard a brother wizard
[2:19:16] dead they're all coming out and made a
[2:19:17] circle just hearing this a young girl
[2:19:19] tting about what a marvelous God that we
[2:19:23] serve and then this time Storm
[2:19:26] come you know how tropical storm in
[2:19:28] Manila just so I could hear way worse
[2:19:30] than here the lightning started flashing
[2:19:33] the Thunder started roaring and the the
[2:19:36] r started dropping they can hear the
[2:19:38] rain I I was in an other Hotel the r
[2:19:41] started pouring and I saw then then they
[2:19:44] said that the r started dropping on the
[2:19:46] Shing goes just as the r started to
[2:19:49] pouring down but you know what not one
[2:19:52] drop of rain that in that little circle
[2:19:55] that is 10 15 people which is gathering
[2:19:58] there God
[2:20:01] determined nobody going to disturb that
[2:20:04] his daughter to share about how God
[2:20:08] delivered a person
[2:20:23] Satan can claim her
[2:20:25] mind Satan can claim her body but Satan
[2:20:30] couldn't claim her
[2:20:32] soul Satan claimed the legion but Satan
[2:20:36] couldn't claim the Gin that laid inside
[2:20:39] of that soul that in the
[2:20:43] religion but God can
[2:20:45] claim God claim that little girl that
[2:20:49] has been depressed for 5 years and you
[2:20:53] know what this girl after that she's uh
[2:20:56] helping us with the
[2:21:00] translation she helping with about a 50
[2:21:03] some of message that has been
[2:21:06] translated what a marvelous God that we
[2:21:09] serve Satan looks like a very
[2:21:13] powerful but our God is way more
[2:21:17] powerful look and live look and live yes
[2:21:21] my brother my sister just look and
[2:21:25] live you know God don't required us to
[2:21:27] do a lot of things but he required us to
[2:21:31] give us everything to him you know just
[2:21:35] before they
[2:21:37] came I was a look at at a scripture
[2:21:39] talking about the the reown
[2:21:41] ruler I look at a I look at that I
[2:21:43] thought what a Pity what a Pity that
[2:21:47] Rich Young Ruler he's a rich
[2:21:51] and he's a
[2:21:52] young and he's a
[2:21:55] ruler and he's not something corruptible
[2:22:00] person even Jesus look at him the Bible
[2:22:04] said that Jesus love
[2:22:06] him brother BR said that the young man
[2:22:08] had the right
[2:22:09] approach he run to Jesus he's not a deor
[2:22:14] he's not just uh whatever come or
[2:22:16] whatever goes he run to Jesus he kneel
[2:22:19] down he said a master good Master what
[2:22:23] can I do to inherit eternal life he got
[2:22:28] a
[2:22:29] everything and that a mom and dad
[2:22:31] probably can you're really Desiring for
[2:22:35] but he still doesn't possess of eternal
[2:22:38] life and he finds that the right object
[2:22:41] the right one that he can ask for he had
[2:22:46] a right attitude towards the Eternal
[2:22:49] Word and that hour he done everything
[2:22:53] right not one thing he did it wrong
[2:22:56] everything he done is all
[2:23:00] right and Jesus even love him even when
[2:23:04] he died later on going to hell he still
[2:23:08] held his
[2:23:09] testimony in hell he didn't say where my
[2:23:11] riches go in hell he didn't said that
[2:23:15] where my treasure all gone in hell he
[2:23:18] look it up
[2:23:20] but it's not to look and live in hell
[2:23:23] he's still looking it up and so Lazarus
[2:23:27] in the bosom of Abraham said go get some
[2:23:30] water touch my tongue and he in hell he
[2:23:33] even testified said go to my loved
[2:23:37] one I have a five brothers let them
[2:23:39] don't come over here if one resurrected
[2:23:43] from Death he know about a resurrection
[2:23:45] if a one resurrected from the death go
[2:23:48] to them they will know
[2:23:51] what a
[2:23:52] character in hell he still had a
[2:23:55] testimony in Hell he's not thinking of
[2:23:58] himself he's thinking about his own
[2:23:59] Brothers he's thinking about his loved
[2:24:03] ones but he's facing the eternal
[2:24:06] life but he
[2:24:09] rejected Jesus said you only need one
[2:24:15] thing
[2:24:16] Brothers if Jesus tell us Murphy you
[2:24:21] only need to do one thing I will say
[2:24:24] Lord not one thing give me two thing
[2:24:27] three milon
[2:24:29] whatever but the Lord said to him you
[2:24:31] only need to do one
[2:24:34] thing if anyone of here if the Lord
[2:24:37] coming here ask you I only need you to
[2:24:39] do one thing you will be run to do it no
[2:24:44] matter what if I have to use my noses to
[2:24:48] push on the floor and to get the the the
[2:24:51] coin push it over there I will do it
[2:24:53] just one thing think about it just do
[2:24:55] one thing you can get eternal
[2:25:00] life but that one thing is
[2:25:05] everything that one thing is
[2:25:09] everything he couldn't do
[2:25:12] it he's not able to do it he didn't
[2:25:17] reject it orally he just turned around
[2:25:21] sadly he never rejected a
[2:25:24] message he never rejected a message by
[2:25:27] saying
[2:25:28] it but by not receiving it he rejected
[2:25:34] it but then when I read further on I
[2:25:37] thought what a pity for that reach Young
[2:25:41] Ruler if he can just
[2:25:45] stay though he cannot do it but if he
[2:25:49] can just St
[2:25:50] say just for a few
[2:25:53] moment because right after
[2:25:56] that Jesus said it's so hard for a rich
[2:26:01] man to enter into
[2:26:05] heaven it's so hard it's a harder is the
[2:26:09] camel go through the eyes of a needle is
[2:26:12] uh is easier for the rich man then go to
[2:26:16] heaven and we know what the eyes of an
[2:26:18] needle is right that the camel has to go
[2:26:20] through the gates CA the eyes of a
[2:26:22] needle they have to unload and then the
[2:26:25] camel can go through still can doable
[2:26:27] can go to it just you have to unload so
[2:26:30] to get in but Jesus said it's so
[2:26:34] hard but if that young man can wait a
[2:26:36] little bit more later Jesus said just in
[2:26:40] that the same
[2:26:42] chapter and Peter said Lord we have
[2:26:46] forsaking all have a follow to you
[2:26:52] and then Jesus then G they said Peter
[2:26:56] said he said Lord now who can be saved
[2:26:59] who can go you know what Jesus said to
[2:27:04] man is
[2:27:06] impossible but to God all things are
[2:27:10] possible I wish I was that a young man
[2:27:14] that reach your own ruler if he can just
[2:27:16] wait for a few seconds he will hear
[2:27:19] Jesus said to man is
[2:27:22] impossible but to God all things are
[2:27:27] possible then if I would be to the young
[2:27:29] man I would say Lord I couldn't do it I
[2:27:33] couldn't give it up but you said to man
[2:27:38] is impossible but to God all things are
[2:27:42] possible I believe you Lord Lord you
[2:27:45] take that desire away from me you take
[2:27:48] that pornography out of me you take that
[2:27:50] lust out of me you take that
[2:27:53] condemnation out of me you take that
[2:27:56] depression out of me I couldn't do it
[2:27:58] but to man that's impossible but to God
[2:28:01] all things are
[2:28:03] [Applause]
[2:28:04] possible because of just a two chapter
[2:28:06] before that there was a father with a
[2:28:10] son got epy and couldn't got delivered
[2:28:13] the disciples couldn't cast The Demon
[2:28:16] out of him thy father take the son one
[2:28:19] to Jesus Jesus said Lord if you can do
[2:28:22] anything please do something it's not
[2:28:26] said to Lord I believe you Lord you are
[2:28:28] marvelous I have a 100% Faith toward you
[2:28:32] he said Lord if there's anything you can
[2:28:34] do your disciple failed but Lord is
[2:28:36] there anything that you can
[2:28:38] do Jesus said if you can
[2:28:43] believe if you can believe all things
[2:28:45] are
[2:28:46] possible you know what that father said
[2:28:50] that father doesn't have a 100% pure
[2:28:52] face that father said I
[2:28:55] believe but help thou my unbelief I
[2:28:59] still have unbelief in me Lord I'm not
[2:29:02] trying to be hypocrite toward you I
[2:29:05] still am not what I ought to be I still
[2:29:07] the things that are in my life I feel
[2:29:09] shamed about it I couldn't do it myself
[2:29:12] but Lord you said all things are
[2:29:14] possible to man that's impossible but to
[2:29:18] God all things are possible Lord I do
[2:29:23] believe but
[2:29:25] Lord my face just not reached up to
[2:29:28] there but Lord help my
[2:29:32] unbelief Jesus never give him an
[2:29:35] education Jesus never turn around and
[2:29:37] said you go to read a read a Seal's
[2:29:40] books again go to go to the the church
[2:29:43] to hear the preaching Jesus turn around
[2:29:45] and they cast a demon out of that man
[2:29:48] that of is his son
[2:29:50] to man that's impossible but to God all
[2:29:55] things are
[2:30:02] possible what a marvelous God that we
[2:30:05] serve if it required us let a musician
[2:30:08] come if just it required
[2:30:13] us I we probably like that of reach
[2:30:15] Young Ruler said how can we do
[2:30:18] this that's impossible for me to
[2:30:21] do but I'm so glad we hear that the word
[2:30:24] said to man is
[2:30:28] impossible but to God all things are
[2:30:32] possible and when when that a father did
[2:30:37] that Jesus turned around and casted a
[2:30:41] demon out of his son I was thinking of
[2:30:44] how God has a cast out a demon of
[2:30:46] Oppression depression from the young
[2:30:49] girl
[2:30:51] you know he so like that Elijah he asked
[2:30:54] get the servant is said to go
[2:30:56] up is said to to look at it the see
[2:30:59] where the cloud going to come where the
[2:31:02] rain going to come he said I heard the r
[2:31:05] songs of an abundant R though it looks
[2:31:08] like they just the size of a men's hand
[2:31:11] of a cloud that are coming out of him
[2:31:12] sea but Elijah saw difference he saw the
[2:31:16] r is coming I think this is a Time
[2:31:20] before it us to look at it well we all
[2:31:22] we have always been looking but we don't
[2:31:25] need to the changer look just to look
[2:31:27] straight to what the word of God has
[2:31:29] said Lord if you ever say so I believe
[2:31:32] it one time two times three times four
[2:31:35] times keep on looking the things that we
[2:31:38] always look what God has a Vindicated as
[2:31:41] a proof to be the truth if you keep on
[2:31:43] looking it and God will make sure that
[2:31:47] size of a man's hand of a cloud would
[2:31:49] become a two hands of a cloud the
[2:31:51] brother Bram said will be a three size
[2:31:54] three hands of a cloud and before we
[2:31:56] know it it will be the head of a cloud
[2:31:59] and they are coming on you like the head
[2:32:01] of a cloud on Arizona so you have been
[2:32:04] Justified the Judgment has to pass the
[2:32:07] sin has been judged the blood has to

[2:54:07] step right down here just one more step
[2:54:10] and turn right around amen turn around
[2:54:13] this
[2:54:14] way okay take a seat right there on that
[2:54:17] little right there God bless you Our
[2:54:19] Sister Janice comes today I've known her
[2:54:23] since she was a young girl and her and
[2:54:26] brother Alvin and they you know been
[2:54:29] through a lot of things in life and you
[2:54:32] know if brother brandom would look in a
[2:54:34] vision he'd say I'd see a dark streak
[2:54:37] that's following you and lots of trouble
[2:54:39] in life as you went down and our
[2:54:42] sister's been through a lot of different
[2:54:44] things in life but you know God is a God
[2:54:47] that's rich in Mercy
[2:54:49] and the thing about it is is no matter
[2:54:51] how long it takes a predestinated seed
[2:54:55] he's going to W work upon their lives
[2:54:57] till he finds them and they yield to him
[2:55:00] he will he will he will chase after him
[2:55:03] with mercy and with Grace and we want to
[2:55:06] thank God for what he has been doing in
[2:55:08] her life is certainly the angel of God
[2:55:12] coming and bringing an Awakening within
[2:55:14] her of realizing I need a savior
[2:55:18] and she has come today and said I I'm
[2:55:21] I'd rather not even live if I have to go
[2:55:25] without his spirit in my life and really
[2:55:28] that's the only time you will live is
[2:55:30] when you receive a spirit into your life
[2:55:34] amen now I want to tell you the Lord
[2:55:36] Jesus has sent us as his children in
[2:55:40] this day and hour to Bear witness of him
[2:55:43] and to uh for those that would believe
[2:55:46] on him to take on his name as a part of
[2:55:48] his family and today as this one comes
[2:55:52] to the Lord and makes a full surrender
[2:55:55] of her life that today as we bury the

[2:56:11] longer to be a servant of sin but to be
[2:56:14] a child of the Living God and serve him
[2:56:18] the rest of her life so we believe and
[2:56:21] we know and we declare that to be the
[2:56:23] truth now John the Baptist would preach
[2:56:26] of Jesus coming and he would say he said
[2:56:29] there you know I will baptize you with
[2:56:32] water but there is one that is coming

[2:56:36] the Holy Ghost in fire I am here today
[2:56:40] as John was to baptize in water but I
[2:56:43] want you to know that there is one that
[2:56:45] is coming after this baptism that will
[2:56:48] baptize her with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[2:56:51] and she will rise in the newness of life
[2:56:55] to serve the Living God and in the name
[2:56:58] of Jesus Christ has God sent me into the
[2:57:01] world to preach the gospel to every
[2:57:03] creature and to baptize them that
[2:57:06] believe in the name of the father and of
[2:57:08] the son and of the Holy Ghost I baptize
