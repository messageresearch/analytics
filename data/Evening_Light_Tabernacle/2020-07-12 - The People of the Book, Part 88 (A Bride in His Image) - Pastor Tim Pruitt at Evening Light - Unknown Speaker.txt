you father jesus name we love you and thank you father jesus name just keep your head about just for a moment i just learned that today is sister sharon johnson is here from shreveport that her mother passed away and we did not know about this but we just want to ask god's blessings upon her today as we learn of this it's not a law she's not lost we know where she's at i certainly miss her being here today we pray for comfort father we pray for a special comfort for sister sharon and her family as mother has crossed the dimensions into the realms of the blessed lord we do not suffer as those who have no hope because our hope is in jesus we place our loved ones into your arms lord asking that you would comfort sister sharon her family give them strength encouragement faith and hope in this hour this time lord give strength lord your people today as we look to you now it's in the name of jesus we ask it thank you father thank you in jesus name amen amen god bless you before you're seated this morning we're going to read a scripture in romans chapter 8 and verse 28 romans 8 verse 28 and we know that all things can you say all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose and i believe god's got a purpose for our life and that nothing even happens to us on this earth without a purpose amen for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called in whom he called then he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified amen god bless you amen as you're seated today i want to just take just a moment before i go into my message today and i want to i want to congratulate and wish my bosom friends brother donny reagan his wife sister carol they both had a happy birthday on june on july the 9th and congratulations on their 47th wedding anniversary on july the 8th and they're an example of true love and devotion to each other and to god and i want you to know we stand in solidarity you know the same like-mindedness with brother donnie i've loved him and his ministry from the very first time i've met him some 33 years ago and we became instant friends and he even he and i have not just been close friends um but through the years there's probably no minister that i can say that i agree with doctrinally more than him and he's a great student of the word and well versed in the knowledge of the message an anointed servant of god with a supernatural ministry vindicated with signs that follow the believers and of course i recommend anybody who lives in that area to go to church there it's a well-balanced ministry amen it's certainly been a blessing to us through the years as we've had him in our special meetings in regular meetings through the years and in youth camps and and dedication services and just wonderful times um together um there are several things that i want to talk to you about today before we go into our message and so um if you just settle down for a moment you know the other day i made mention of sister lana she just had a clear scan just a few days ago a few weeks ago now and the kin remains cancer free and we thank god for that and man she had a great moment of victory um in the service of february 18 2018 where i was preaching on the revealing of sons and that's now been nearly two and a half years ago and god is still on the throne still manifesting his great glory and that same service we had a brother john christophel from south africa that contacted me about his wife's condition of stage 3 rectal cancer and he being in south africa there he had been able unable to get a job and he was in a very bad financial condition a young young minister and his wife and they were struggling and struggling with the um the the medical bills and so on and and um you know we we at that time were certainly uh preaching a lot of different things along the realm of faith and believing for sister lanna and just encourage her and encourage the people encourage us to believe god for his words and his promises and um to see god come on the scene and to see um the lord heal sister lana with that fourth stage hodgkin's lymph lymphoma and god healed her and delivered her just instantly completely and um you know where that she went back the next day on the i think it was a 19th on a monday or tuesday at least just that week and had a scan and doctors didn't know what to say about it and there it is right there where the cancer is in the lung and there it is the next scan and there's there is absolutely no cancer and this is still the testimony today two and a half years later amen we thank god for that [Applause] this um very same time that this was going on this brother from south africa i've never met him but you know there's just sometimes it's things just grip your heart and he told me about his situation and and um and so he i told him i would send him a prayer cloth because we we believed according to the book of acts that they took uh handkerchiefs from the body or aprons from the body of saint paul and laid them upon the sick and they were healed now of course we're not saint paul but he's still the same jesus amen and his word is still the truth so we sent out in the i prayed over that in the post and and uh this same week of sister lana's scan i received a um an unsolicited email with from brother john uh giving me um photos of his wife and his testimony and i wanted to just go back into that service just a moment where that we prayed for her and i i want to i'm doing this for a reason i'm doing this for a reason because i i think we must come with very great sincerity in every service expecting god to move and when we pray if it's even somebody from overseas somewhere over in south africa we never heard of we've never seen it doesn't matter they're our brother and sister in christ and we're going to pray with fervency and believe god for them amen so michael if you will take us back into that service just for a moment just for this clip where we prayed for brother john christopher and his wife the voice of yours right now the bible said that you call on the name of the lord you shall be saved amen you want deliverance deliverances in the house of god i mean you need peace in your life there's peace like a river you need joy there's joy like a river oh man there's peace like a fountain there's the holy ghost to move in your life to turn you to faith to cause you to believe to lift you up out of sin hallelujah i don't care how long you've been bound amen i don't care how long you felt defeated i don't care how long you've been in slavery we are heard a voice that said let my people go and there's some devil tormentors in this building this morning that's gonna torment the devil until we leave from here we're not going to give him any peace we're not going to give him any rest but there is some devil that fears some serpent bruisers some overcomers some people that are empowered where he's revealing himself [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah revealing himself in your life this morning amen giving you the faith to believe it's for me hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i said hallelujah i said let's praise our god let's say i say god is moving in stream why don't you react amen not in a formal way but in the power of the holy ghost let him lift you up today to rise with him hallelujah hallelujah satan i announce to you you are defeated i announce to you they're sons of god that are in that are the actors on the scene right now where god is revealing himself in his sonship in sons of god to declare to this generation the name and the authority of jesus christ now take your lying deceiving hands over god's people i loosened this morning to serve the living god able to have joy like they've never known to be free of the bondage and the slave bounds of sin and believe in the name of jesus christ i declare it hallelujah that thinking part go to praising amen everything has to bow to the name of jesus christ [Applause] let my people go [Music] hallelujah thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you lord we glorify your name lord for your worthy hallelujah down at the cross where my savior died glory to his name will you worship with me this morning [Music] i've got in my hands this morning a couple of prayer cloths [Music] they're going to go to south africa to a little home where a little preacher [Music] without a job in a broken condition with a little wife in the third stages of rectal cancer [Music] and we're sending on the wings of this trap we're here as devil defeaters serpent bruisers sending a message that they're sons of god being revealed in this day we are taking over satan's dominion [Music] amen we're we're sending it right here as it did in the book of acts where from the body of paul hankers was taken late on the sick aprons laid on the sick and evil spirits departed from that i believe it's going to happen amen you may have a need in your life this morning while i pray for this and you pray with me i want you to pray as we bind the devil and the power of satan satan you are defeated [Music] in the hands of a redeemed son amen in the congregation of redeemed children of god we are standing this morning in prayer for a counterpart over in south africa in a little town maybe a little place maybe feeling forgotten maybe feeling feeling a reject or are not not important europe you are speaking to them this morning amen even as we send them the wings of this prayer healing healing in the name of jesus satan you have bound god's people long enough [Music] but the eyes of god's people the elect is coming open amen there's understanding that it's coming to somebody to believe that they are the call of this generation and i say to this cancer cancer you cannot stand in the presence of god and i rebuke you in the name of jesus taking the authority of the word of god and commanded you to leave that body and for the misfortunes that follow this little preacher i pray god you'll get him in your will you give him that job that he needs lord i pray not only for them but for all of these that are in this congregation and around the world right now they'll just believe if they'll just believe right now while we pray something is about to happen they just believe lord we're just holding the hand long enough for the swelling to go down amen until until we can see it's dead it's over with it's done and in the name of jesus i proclaim liberty to those that are bound and i proclaim the freedom and the joy of the lord to this church and to the believers who believe now in jesus name for the glory of god amen now lift up those people's hands and hang down amen begin to praise him now from the depths of your heart praise the lord i just got this email from him saying i'm sharing the pictures of how my wife looked during her hospital stay in 2018 how the chemotherapy radiation took her hair which is her glory but god rich in mercy has restored her hair she's completely healed by the hand of the lord i still have that prayer cloth whenever we we feel sick or heavy burden or for any problem we lay that prayer cloth on us and claim god's blessings and healing power over us and we have testimonies of god's grace and healing and and of course um just uh just just weeks right after that that we prayed there he got a job there that was almost impossible to get god just moved on the scene for him in a tremendous way and we want to say thank the lord amen praise the lord hallelujah amen sister atlanta you stand just for a moment just as a trophy of the grace of god amen hallelujah god's not dead he's alive amen he's still working in the hearts and lives of god's people amen amen god bless you just wanted to tell you a little bit before we go into the message this morning what we've been through in the last couple of weeks as you know the last two sundays i i have not been in the pulpit we um we have of course um had some situations in at home where my wife had a complete a tremendous brain bleed there and was sent to the hospital into lsu where they did surgery on her um you may not know and i understand the severity of where we were but um the doctors gave us very grim news said that you know she could live five minutes or five years but she would not have any quality of life if she did and they came out and and told me just to prepare for death that that's how severe that it was even when i got the call from lsu i knew by the way that they um asked me about the surgery that they wasn't given much hope for her recovery and um as you know today we're we're here on the other side of that and we can rejoice because there's no loss of limb no loss of memory it means she's complete amen we thank god for that and god has answered prayer just to kind of go back over some of these things just for a moment a week before last you know brother ron spencer was here it was kind of a surprise visit um most of you didn't know about it because we kept it secret brother ron spencer is a pastor friend of ours from over in virginia and um he is a muslim friend of of mine and and uh someone that i love very much and he has had stage four melanoma cancer it spread from his lungs and jumped into his brain just right after that he got it he had a first aid clear brain scan and then you know uh and i just thankful well it's not in his brain it's just in his lungs well he jumped right immediately into the lungs from the lungs into the brain but um you know he has steadfastly believed and we've been praying and believing with him and by the way brother timothy caught the wind of the spirit this morning as we as as i just had it on the tip of my tongue to tell you don't go and pray for your mom don't go and pray for brother ron you go and thank god for their healing that's what i want you to do i want you to thank god it's already done amen we're confessing it and we're believing it but he had preached at his own home church um just um a bit prior to him coming the weekend before he was coming i must get to jesus and in reference to the queen of the south uh who came to hear the wisdom of solomon he noted that you know that people would would drive 17 18 hours to get into brother branham's meetings to get in the presence of jesus and would be healed and it struck him afterwards that he must do the same and so he wanted to drive over here to louisiana and spend some time with me and for me to pray for him now of course you know i'm not a healer the lord is a healer but um it's there's gifts in the body and gifts of healing is one let me explain it like this uh just sharing this from looking under jesus and said you know what the gift of healing is faith in healing you just release your faith to pray for somebody that's all a gift of healing is every minister should have it everybody you see should have a gift of healing the power that heals you is on the inside of you the holy spirit you just have to let it work its way out so brother ron wanted to come and and we were excited about him coming i started praying and fasting in preparation for his coming here he was going to leave his after church on sunday and drive here and would arrive on monday which he did but after making the decision to come he told his family now you just watch the devil try to stop this and and of course he did but the devil don't have enough amen my wife karen was excited about him coming she was gonna make his favorite german chocolate cake and went shopping on thursday to get all the supplies for his arrival and and um and then that night at about 11 p.m she woke me up by going to the bathroom turning on the light and i asked her if she was okay and she said i've got a terrible headache and she mentioned she was going into another room and and um uh take her blood pressure i followed her in there and found her with her head on the table groaning and um i said we we got to go to the hospital now and she said that she protested no i don't want to go i don't need to go i just threw a robe around her and made her get in the car and we were you know on her way she was just groaning and moaning and there would be moments that i was thought she had passed out and she became nauseated throwing up and uh i was going to drive all the way to shreveport because that's where the neuro unit is in the trauma unit in shreveport at the lsu oscars and the doctors but i i couldn't make it that far because of her throwing up and the pain level and so i whipped into menden medical center and there they um intubated her and she was totally unconscious doctor's report from the scans was she wasn't going to make it yeah she had a huge brain bleed it was pushing the right side of her brain out of position and the damage would cause her to die and if she lived and the doctor said she would only be a vegetable well friday morning sister karen had emergency brain surgery where they relieved the pressure they cauterized the vessels and um you know i as i was just praying and assessing the situation i just began to realize that she was there in the nicu that and and i stood beside her there immediately i watched her she was wheeled out of surgery and stood there by her bedside on friday and saturday morning i was there again and as i was praying there i just said you know i'm not going to let this stop brother ron from coming and so i made arrangements for for my daughters to um to go to the icu room since their mother was really you know out of it didn't didn't know really what was going on and so i made arrangements for them to go and i called brother ron and i said um i i you come on i said we'll we'll meet over at our camp there at haven's rest and and uh so he he he came they left right after church on sunday he ministered they drove all the way to birmingham from birmingham they came here to louisiana monday night we had a prayer meeting together and i guarantee you when you're in a moment like this you just don't just say god bless so-and-so and so it's a moment of desperation and um you know it was a great time in the presence of the lord but i just felt like there was more and i knew i would have another opportunity and tuesday evening we spent the evening speaking of the exploits of faith and creating as i tried to channel the conversation because i wanted to generate a an atmosphere of faith and we just began to talk about exploits of faith and different testimonies of god's healing power and i i began to feel the atmosphere get more and more charged and brother aaron and and of course brother timothy brother michael dexter was there and and brother aaron was about to leave and i said don't leave i said you know i won't we want to pray we're going to have another time of prayer and this time there was a breakthrough to the anointing and then the then as as we've seen the holy spirit just come down there was just things that was you know had been on brother ron's heart he he desired to come back to louisiana again the devil told him he would never be here again and then he wanted to be in a prayer line with me again and the devil told him you'll never have another prayer line with brother tim but right there in that in that camp we had a prayer line and prayed for luke and andrew and adam frazier connie's nephew and god just moved upon them in a tremendous way filling them with the holy spirit of god and and um you know what a presence that was and we saw the holy spirit move and then wednesday night we come to church and brother ron and i spent time together in my office where as you know the tesla he testified of seeing the angel of god and together we prayed again right in that very same spot and since that time god has given brother ron some amazing strength and he is preached with such anointing such anointing and such power since that time and i checked upon him as he arrived home leaving wednesday night and let me just stop here for a moment because that wednesday night service went right on over to brother timothy's house and followed them into the house that anointing and the holy spirit fell upon his children the girls there adriana and katie and god did some amazing things in their life adriana was testifying to me that she got what she needed to be able to testify i have the holy spirit in my life what a wonderful thing god's moving amen what he did for them he'll do for you amen but um brother ron of course the next day getting home on thursday i called him to check on him he's already gone down on three hours to see his dad and has to come three two hours back and the next day he's gone again doing a route with with his son and and different things and he ain't stopped and today today in his home church he's preaching a convention meeting where the service is going to be sent to brother harold hildebrant and brother brother hammermeister there in edmonton where they're going to be playing it in their convention so he's already back to preaching conventions again hallelujah my god is unstoppable his people are unstoppable and the devil don't have enough but god is more than enough i said he's more than enough you'll meet your need this morning whatever it is because this god is thou shalt i and he's more than enough to meet your need to fill you with his spirit to give you a repression from his presence to give you another filling of the holy ghost to take out the lukewarmness and put in there the power of the living god the power of his resurrection hallelujah hallelujah that's a general standing there brother ron spencer god bless him amen yesterday i was sharing the news of the testimony with different ones and i was i had heard from brother buzz bosey from bazabosi from uganda he's done a great work in ethiopia taking the gospel into there and it's just been a tremendous work of this ugandan brother he's a real um firebrand um evangelist and he asked me a question on the book of revelation and so i answered him and he replied and thanked me for the feedback and he added that he was praying for sister karen and so i knew by that that they had heard of that as we have heard from uh us and canada germany belgium switzerland france south africa uh ghana uganda new zealand australia

we have set before us a completely healed person and step by step we will walk into that vision just back in march i had a dream i dreamed i was straightening out a highway and you know that's what i've been doing you know as a you you have a forerunner that goes before the second coming of the lord and we know god used his his servant messenger to to to be uh one who would prepare the way for his coming but all of those that follow that message are under the same anointing and under the same commission amen you know we we see um graham and roberts you know that were used of god in a great way and and but and and and men were got anointed with that same anointing that was upon those men and i want you to know we are under the anointing in this day of the son of man jesus christ amen and and of course we're making straight the path for christ to come and um and so as i was as i was making this path there someone cut i saw in in this dream someone come right up and point blank shot at me but they missed they've got real close real close you can't get much closer than a than a wife and a daughter and a best friend amen amen got real close amen but he missed me he didn't stop me i'm not knocked down and i'm not defeated and i'm not going to quit and i'm going to finish this highway and we're going to see jesus come back we're going to see him reign in power and great glory hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the lord a series of victory is going to be and i'm looking for another victory this morning hallelujah oh we can hear it saying arise and shine for thy light has come that the glory of the lord is upon you a series of victories amen what a wonderful god amen now i'm just going to tell you i went back to that nicu my wife couldn't stay awake and by this time i'm mad amen i got mad at the devil this time i walked into the into the in icu and i laid my hands on her and said satan you take your hands off of her i ain't putting up with you no more amen sometimes you've got to get mad at the devil i'm praying for brother praying for a person brother branham said i'm not yelling you you can't baby demons amen in the message ashamed he said it puts me in mind of something like ourselves said to people i'm getting to a place a spot that i need more faith that's what i'm hoping for now is get a new burst of faith how many liked a new birth of faith god is so look like when you pray for people you apologize mr devil would you move over please and let me nothing faith has got muscles and hair on his chest when it speaks everything else shuts up don't go in mr devil will you move out get out of here i'm a son of god commissioned by god leave them alone that moves you have no apology to the devil nothing to do with him not ashamed of the word not ashamed of your commission not ashamed of who you are amen praise the name of the lord let's look back at the scripture this morning in romans chapter 8 verse 28. you can stand if you'd like that's fine it's always good to do that in honor to the lord and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to this purpose for whom he did for know he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that's what we're going to be speaking on this morning is a bride in his image to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren he wasn't just satisfied with jesus he wants many brethren just like jesus moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called in whom he called then he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified amen god bless you you can have your seats but not only are we his brethren but there's other types that show the church even as his wife paul said a man and his wife is a mystery of christ and his church we find also in genesis chapter 2 and verse 21 that the lord god calls to deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and he closed up the fresh the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man so again this was the very first thing and even paul would refer back to the scripture of the oneness between of a man and his wife and it being a type of christ and his bride that she would be of him she would be of his life she would be of his powers she would be of his spirit she would be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone but then it also types us as his offspring and we could read a lot of scriptures on this but let's just take this one in acts 17 28 for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own points have said for we are also his offspring for as much then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think of the that the godhead is like into gold as silver stone or grave and art or man's desi device in other words like an idol but you you need to think of him as a person in genesis chapter 1 verse 26 god said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them you see adam was immortal like god in his original state his body didn't decay it didn't grow old and die before the fall he was not even a time being if it could have been marked in years he would you would say he was as strong at 200 as he was at 20. he was timeless he was ageless he was an immortal he was an immortal 20 year old and it was not until sin entered that man fell from god's image now your first birth is from the perverted word that the lie that satan taught eve that's how we were born as adam's offspring born in the way that the serpent taught eve this body is not in god's image it decays it grows old it dies you're not as strong even at 80 as you were at 20. sin perverted man's body his spirit his soul and satan enthroned on himself in man's body to sin in and every man fell from that holy image but when adam and eve listened to the lie of the devil the holy image of god left them and and their fellowship was broken with god the fellowship of oneness with god was broken the very minute they listen to the lie of the devil and the very minute that you listen to the lie of the devil it'll break your fellowship with god and that's the very minute that you go out of god's presence like she did is when you fail to take god's word just as it is now in the fall our faith was blinded and the five senses of our flesh took preeminence man originally was have dominion and that word dominion has been lost from man even though he dominates by the realms of his flesh by uh by cutting us and devices and things and and and that he will uh he will dominate animals dominate the earth dominate other men and so on like that but but again it's he does it by the realm of the five senses adam ruled the earth by faith amen now and of course you know when the fall came in man lost his consciousness of what the father had put him on the earth to do in other words all the plumbing as it was in our brain the outlets the faith has been clogged and it gets clogged up even today with business affair and domestic life home life political things all kinds of things will clog us up the the reasoning of science and education will all clog up the faith that should be flowing to our lives clog up the channels and god can't operate through that channel of faith because we're going on our reasoning our memory our imagination our conscience or our affection and just remember i want you to know that you know you here in this fallen state as a mortal being and though your soul might be redeemed your flesh again is it has to also be redeemed it's going to be changed it's like your soul was changed in a moment a twinkling of an eye it will be changed and we'll be glorified and go into his presence is that right amen but it's your flesh that's what keeps you from seeing god face to face you see it is the flesh that is what this veil that keeps us from seeing angels at their position they're always there the angels of god don't just suddenly come they encamp about those that fear him amen the angels did not come down to elisha and gaheza that day but no he said i'm there he said the angels are here god opened the boy's eyes and when his eyes became open he became conscious through the supernatural realm but your flesh is what keeps you from seeing god it blinds your faith because it is the only eye by which you can see god with the only thing that you can understand and know the supernatural with is faith now the veil is the flesh and this flesh keeps us out of his presence even now even in service like this it's hard for you to keep your channel the holy spirit is trying to speak and you're trying to open up a channel but your mind is wandering you know your seed is getting tired your body is getting weary you're thinking about the pressures of life everything else that is going on always just for a moment we can just press out of this amen we can get into the channel of the holy spirit and it can just strike it like a target this morning and get right down in your soul and make you realize god is here unless here all things are possible my healing is possible my deliverance is possible my salvation is possible everything is possible when we realize we're in the presence of god [Applause] this fall you know causes to require us to have a new birth we must be born again we're sons and daughters of god but we live in fallen mortal bodies sad to say you know you can be healed of one thing only to be sick with it again amen you can have a brain bleed and have another brain bleed your body's not immortal it's subject to weaknesses god will heal you like he did the apostle paul there come blow after blow after blow amen but god heals and he heals and he heals he keeps the deliverance amen delivering to your time's up on earth amen now this fall we know produced two seeds that were there was cain the bible said who was of that wicked one there was abel who was adam's son and of course these two races would mix together just before the flood and would become one race and the same thing has happened with the church that just as eve fell by disbelieving the word so did the church fall into unbelief through the dark ages that fell from that original experience of the book of acts and that became far into the church and they become blinded to it and they become deafened and blinded with theology and man's own ideas rather than the word of god in acts chapter 15 we will find that there was pharisees which believed who insisted on requiring circumcision and keeping the law of moses because there were certain of the pharisees which believed never got the new birth there was hymenius and alexander who brought in a new doctrine misinterpreting the scripture spiritualizing the resurrection of the dead and allegorizing away the doctrine of the resurrection and resolving it into just a figure and a metaphor and and of course paul told of what it did he said their words doth eat as a canker it has become a cancer in the church and the church had become infected and diseased rather than a spotless sinless bride then he went on to then then jesus would tell us how the spirit of the antichrist was already working in the church and he would say beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep clothing but inwardly are ravering wolves so he told them beware because there's coming something that is going to push the church off course in acts chapter 20 and verse 29 paul said after my department be departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock and also of your own selves not outsiders but within the church shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after themselves amen second corinthians 11 13 he said for these are such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into apostles of christ revelation 2 2 he would tell them i know your works and this is the first stage thy labor and thy patience and how thou cannot bear them which are evil and has tried them which save their apostles or not and have found them liars and in less than 300 years the church was a fallen woman bringing forth children of her adultery amen now you you know these are hard words to speak but this let me tell you it tells you of two women in the when you come down to the book of revelation it's really about two women a perfect sinless bride that he's going to take in a rapture and a and her harlot daughters who are just like a man and she cannot be that kind unless she's taken and the seeds of another man and receive something else for a husband other than christ himself and that's what makes her the whoreish woman and i tell you when we are the church of any kind takes in the words of another man other than the words of god we have committed the sin of hardem israel was guilty of it who was supposed to be married to jehovah and the gentile church is guilty of the same thing and until the church has become a conglomeration of filth and abomination but i want you to know in the midst of all of this god will have a people he will have a bride without a spot or wrinkle or a blemish his word has declared it he can't look back on his word like to just share with you this little quotation from he cares for you cares we got two churches at hand this morning one of them is a church of pentecost that was organized at pentecost by the holy spirit there's a difference when the holy spirit organizes amen puts a church in order amen the second is the church of the roman catholic church which was organized in nazi rome one is a spiritual birth the other is an intellectual conception now you can find this is where where the separation is in every church and every movement amen exactly right amen one of the spiritual birth the other of an intellectual conception right here in this church there are those of a spiritual birth and others of an intellectual conception amen from that church come all protestants all denominations come from that was the first denomination all denominations come from that one in our relation to that one revelation 17 she was a and she was a mother of harlots and pop can't call the kettle greasy see because it's it's it's just one it's organized it's gone it's in rome i don't care what it is it is gone the bible said we come to those church ages to prove that one is based on spiritual discernment the other is based on educational and intellectual conception amen amen and this is what we come down to spiritual discernment and the other education i'm going to say it you cannot educate people into the message and we've done a good job down through the years a man of educating people and bringing them to an intellectual knowledge but it'll never take the place of a real new birth where it changes you from the inside out and you're not conforming to a church and it's society but you are conforming to christ and his word coming into his image amen he says our church is also the catholic universal church catholic means universal which is a universal belief for all believers one of them is born of the spirit of god and has the holy spirit in it and it proves it by its life doctrine and action that the holy spirit is there because it's the comforter that christ promised working in his church doing the same thing that he did at the beginning that's how the antitoxin of christ's salvation work in the beginning that's the way it works today brings forth the same thing one is made up of a one is an intellectual conception of a denomination made up by a group of men which has a form of godliness as the prophet told us and deny this truth of power now that's just as plain as i know how to make it now there's two church one of them born that nicea and the other born at pentecost one has always been against the other we've been down to the church jesus to prove it one's against the other ones to find dignified intellectual church with fine scholars and so forth and the other is class a bunch of holy rollers amen i wonder where so about some of these message people that can't be classed anymore is holy rose it was at the beginning drunk illiterate fisherman and it's the same thing today it's still classed in the same category one of them is a scientific arrangement the other is a spiritual discernment of the word one is scientifically a reign with one groups of men says intellectual bishop the other is absolutely born of the spirit of god and lives by the spirit of god and it performs and makes to come to pass the words that god promised it shows what anatoxin you're taking have you taken educational toxin have you got the holy spirit anti-toxin oh that subtleness of satan how he can paint that picture and intellectually can make a man that's not born of the spirit of god just turn around and around and there's no way intellectually to down with them them with it there's not a way it's a discernment by faith see discernment we see what the word says then you say brother branham they say they have discernment then let the holy spirit produce what he promised to produce and then we'll believe it see there's the evidence of it now how did the antitoxin act when it struck the person these signs shall follow them that believe he said well if the antitoxins struck that then that's all right amen brother that is that's it we've got to have an anatoxin that produ protects us against the poison of the venom of the snake of the serpent now you see we're not to put a question on the word of god we're to believe it because when the church puts a question upon the word is he the same does he still live in his church and perform his signs and miracles that he did when he was on earth which he surely he so surely promised us in john 14 12. now i'm not even going to read you a quote today that ain't from in in this part that ain't from 63 forward after the seals are open and i want you to see where he's focusing he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater than these shall you do and if i go to my father these signs shall follow them that believe shall follow them the question is to the people today does he really mean it and when you accept what the church says does he really mean it then you put yourself in the same condition that adam did and you join yourself with the woman of the church of the world and separate yourself from the blessings that god has promised to every believer that would separate himself from the world to the word so here we are we're here in the most evil age that there's ever been amen amen we're full of knowledge education unbelief and insanity amen have you ever seen an age that's so insane my god have mercy amen you know it is a it is a time of of insanity people have lost their bearing they've lost their balance but you know it's in this kind of time that god is determined that he's going to bring a people in his image [Music] amen now why has god determined to bring a bride to completion here why would god call or use this time to call the people out of this evil age for his namesake the reason is to try the bride amen we've got to show who's going to stand and who's going to bend or who's going to bow there daniel today is there some hebrew children is there a david that would fly in the face of goliath and said we're not putting up with the uncircumcised of the philistines challenging the servants of the living god is there somebody a man who would who would stand and be proven in this day and time whatever seed was planted that's what's to come up we're seeing seeds of deceit and we're seeing seeds of the weak word of god just as the seed of the church fell back there with signs and wonders and the living christ among them it ends in the last days under the ministry of malachi 4 and restore restores and get back again the original faith that was once given we find the civil agents to prove to satan she is not like eve she is not that type of woman she will be tried by his word the bride adam's bride or christ bride or or ass with adam's bride was tried by the word and and she believed every bit but just a little part of it all confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever amen i'm determined we're not going to be confused on that promise he is christ the same he man he's the same as he was there he's the same god dwelling today come on now amen failed one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and we are facing the enemy today and he wants to take away from you your promise that christ is still the same that he's still here in power that he's still here in his glory that he's here in his bride form to do what he did in the groom form [Applause] amen oh hallelujah let me share this one here this is a prophecy that was spoke and this comes from spoken word is original seed he said these last days the true church bride comes to the headstone she will be a super church a super race as she nears that great headstone they will be so much like him until they will be in his very image amen there will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god manifestation is a display a presentation a demonstration an exhibition an expression of the word of the living god a people in his image now let me tell you something is she going to be a super church she's going to be a supernatural church man hey man if she's going to be a super race she's going to have a super faith she's going to have supernatural power amen remember legion in the bible he he was a he had super strength so surrendered to the evil one that he could break chains and like the boy at camp this year or last year actually now we didn't get to have camp this year but last year the boy camp and took five strong men or more to hold him down amen amen five strong men to hold him down but the demon had him controlled and fighting and and and frothing and and speaking uh things that he should never utter amen but one moment in the presence of god as i stood over that boy and just began to say peace i didn't yell i just said peace peace peace peace and i'll lock my eyes in his eyes and all of the moment in just a moment he says i'm free it's gone brother jim i'm it's gone i'm free it broke the chain come on now a whisper from god will defeat every devil amen when the devil is screaming and going on and on and on and on and fighting and everything else and just in the presence of god one moment and chains are broken somebody with me amen oh listen if a man could give his strength over to the devil and man that could give him five times the strength where he got having to be held down by five men what would a complete surrender to god do hallelujah could take a i don't care how long they've been there in a wheelchair that's weak and his body could walk amen if we could just completely yield to the holy ghost it gives us a super strength to rise in the name of jesus christ but greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world the strength in god that is in you is greater than any affliction that can come upon you there's nothing can overtake you that can supersede you because you are full of superpower and that superpower is the holy spirit that dominates your life if you're a christian are you a christian then there's a new supernatural strength in the church amen you know the other day god took one of our newborns a little newborn mother just before she's baptized to lay her hands upon her son who was wearing a hearing aid and not able to heal since he was born a little baby come on now and that i'm talking about now what was the weakest one among us a brand new newborn baby can i say it before she was even baptized but it given her heart to christ lays her hand over on her child amen and what happens her child starts hearing is that right that's the power that's in the church amen if that's in a newborn what ought to be to a real son and daughter of god who's mature who knows their place in the scripture amen that's where it ought to be in the church my goodness i remember in germany when i was there preaching and the holy spirit moving in the meetings there with the other brothers preaching and their woman comes out holding a hearing aids and said here i don't need any of these anymore i was in service today and god healed my ears and i walked into the shower a while ago and i took my hearing aids off and he said i could hear children playing and in the shower running does anybody else need these hearing aids you couldn't give them to me for a million dollars i don't want him amen i want the same god that healed your ears amen don't you want that same god for you this morning hey man it ain't a hearing aid we need come on amen what we need is the aid of the holy ghost to come working among his church [Applause] not to preach of christ yesterday but a christ that is the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] i wonder who is willing to go from questioning how can these things be to be it unto me according to thy word this brought mary from baroness to being impregnated by the spirit and that's the only thing that'll bring a barren church to make her feel with life when we quit questioning can we do it how is this going to be and start accepting the angels is talking to me god sent me a message and said i'm highly favored amen god's given you a message this morning telling you you're highly favored if you're sick in your body you're highly favored god's going to make this work out for your good i mean today your trouble can be over hallelujah why because there's a god on the scene we're here to express his mind we have eternal life his own life is in us and man that's the only way you can have eternal life has had the very life of jesus christ on the inside of you where god separated himself and gave us his spirit like he did on the day of pentecost amen and through this the mind of christ ought to be operating among us the holy ghost the spirit of jesus moving in your life now somebody in this day is going to accept the headship of the word they're going to let the word have preeminence in their lives are you with me amen so god wants to express himself in his church how in the fullness of his godhead bodily amen in his church it was the anointed man on the sea of galilee but now it's the anointed people amen how are we anointed by accepting the word that eve turned down hallelujah she believed it all except he was the same yesterday today and forever oh we can believe what happened 50 years ago but can we believe in the present day i [Applause] am sir amen this bride will be a token assigned to the world she will be something that the world can look and say ah she's just a holy roller she's a second cousin she don't belong in our group you know i remember one of the sermons brother branham preaches why am a holy roller i wonder i wonder when the last time a sermon like that's been preached in a message church they don't want to be a holy roller they don't want to be spirit-filled they won't say yes i've got the holy ghost yes i speak in tongues yes i believe in prophecy yes i believe all the word of god they want to say god was yesterday but not today let me just talk about just for a minute if this bride is to be anointed like christ was a bride was anointed and have his anointed be of his flesh be of his bone be of his life then look here with me in acts 10 38 and let's see how jesus was anointed how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power that words left with among with too many people power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him amen come on this friday is going to be a super church a super race a super people come on amen god anointed jesus and isis with the holy ghost and power god hates a powerless religion come on god hates it when a church is so dead there's not even a shout not even an amen anymore not even a glory to god when it's been years that there's there hadn't been a miriam dance in the church hallelujah we'd have played the rest of that on february the 18th 2018 and i was singing glory to his name and got into leaning on the everlasting arm and out of the mezzanine came sister lana a little frail cancer-eating mother a man who the doctors had said was dying with a cancer amen but dare she come out of that mezzanine and dance all around this building with the miriam dance hallelujah and there at the pulpit we declared your enemy is dead your enemy is dead and she goes back the next day healed and they have to testify you're a healed woman and we don't know what happened and it wasn't our medicine this has never happened before that's what they thought but it's happened before and it'll happen again [Applause] hallelujah you know why because god is the god of the miraculous he is a god of miracles all down through the bible he worked miracles it was a miracle when he opened up the red sea it was a miracle when he called dirt and made them naps and flies it was a miracle when he turned water into blood [Applause] it was a miracle when a fish swallowed jonah that was created by god that was a miracle of creation that swallowed jonah and spit him out on dry land our god is a god of the miraculous you have been asked to believe in the miraculous amen if you don't believe in the miraculous how in the world you think there's going to be a rapture where you're going to be standing on your feet and be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye and gray hair cut back the right color again glasses fall off and all the other things are gone because why the miraculous has been done and god showed us over and over and over he's a god of miracles listen where do we have come down to the ages courageous faith come on courageous faith like a lion anointed a generation spirit of an ox a calf a spirit of sacrifice anointed those in the dark ages and they gave their lives willingly so how could that do it how could a father do it a mother do it and watch their babies be killed in front of them and then their eyes put out or their their dip their hair dipped in tar and burn how could they do it spirit of the ox amen spirit of sacrifice amen comes and moves into the intelligence of a man is that right oh man the gutenberg press comes along puts the bible in in written form amen man using intelligence defeated the romans said the just shall live by faith is that right amen god use the intelligence of a man but i want you to know today is eagle anointing [Music] amen oh hallelujah i mean when we come down to it there are people that have great the tenacious faith courageous faith that lays a hold on a promise and lying like anointing gets a hold of that promise and won't let it go you ever see a lion take its prey it'll it'll take it and choke it to death you took them all them old them all apostles there and that day with their courageous faith they laid hold on devils and choked them to death is that right amen we have then another and god still heals he he heals with with the ox anointing there are many that die and they move into a new body we're healed because he heals all diseases even in death we're not defeated these all died in faith god uses the intelligence of a man and got to use doctors in medicine come on he will do it but i want you to know that's not our anointing amen our anointing is the miracle the third pool was a miracle come on spoken word bad tumors vanish spoken word fish resurrected spoken word squirrels created spoken word stones moved out into out of existence amen what was it miracle miracle miracle miracle the rapture is going to be a miracle standing on your feet you'll see the dead in christ rise and come to you and that all of a sudden you will be changed to be like them and you'll be caught up to meet him in the air we still believe in the rapture we still believe in the click catching up so brother tim we're already in the rapture i'll give you that we've heard the shout and we are the voice but there's still going to be his coming where we'll meet him in the air so well ever i won't see him but no but mine will and i ain't worried about everybody else's eyes seeing him i just want to see because when i see him we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is we're under the eagle anointing the eagle snatches his prey right down there you know and then snatches and you know the eagle of all of those the lion is an earth he's an earth dwelling animal a a a man earth dwelling animal a a um an ox he's earth dwelling but the eagle is specified flying eagle as i've often said he's not a sitting duck we're not going to be as sickened up for the devil to take down we're a flying eagle and the eagle is the only one of them that don't have to worry about crossing the river hallelujah hey man you don't have to worry about building a bridge or taking a boat or doing this without to get across the river he just lifts his wing into the ramen place and he flies he flies right over the river between the natural and the supernatural where all things are possible to them that believe god called you to be eagles in this day to believe in the miraculous snatch you right out of your troubles in the nick of time hallelujah god's got him a masterpiece you are god's masterpiece god's gotten my masterpiece for nearly 4 000 years god's been making himself a masterpiece there there jesus was a fulfillment the masterpiece of the old testament but at calvary of peace come off of him you know that just as when when adam was laid down out of him was taken the the rib the parson to make his wife at calvary god did the same he took a portion out of christ the water the blood and the spirit those were the three elements that came out of christ amen what was that for to make a bride she she has she is of his water baptizing his name blood sanctified and cleansed by the blood and receives the holy ghost justification sanctification and baptism of the holy ghost is that right amen that's the bride but you know she's at peace that was struck off of him at calvary that came out of him and as the groom fulfilled the old testament this bride fulfills the new testament you've got quite a calling to do you're to fulfill the new testament and all the new testament speaks of this hour hallelujah jesus christ speaks of this hour amen oh my do you do you realize friends this is where we're at we're in the we're in the day and hour where the that the same word that spoke of the groom it also speaks of the bride can you say man this is what brother branham said and it is the rise of the son the same word that spoke of the groom it speaks also of the bride oh my your people who have been prophesied now we realize revival for the world is over i said for the world but that don't mean we can't have revival that don't mean you as an individual can't be revived that don't mean that you have to go along in cold old dirty laodicea and swooped down and carried down by the world and and it's cares come on amen there ought to be a holy power surrounding in that church that'll make demons flee the principal work of the church is to cast out devils that's what salvation is is casting out devils that's what healing the sick is is casting out devils and when the church loses the power to cast out devils she's a backslidden church when that's no longer her emphasis she's a backslidden church we've made a revelation oh we call it revelation it ain't nothing but carnal in in uh carnal uh intellectualism and that's all it is we're calling it revelation real revelation gives you stimulation real level revelation is quickening power real revelation amen what make you act like they did on the day of pentecost hallelujah amen there ought to be a holy power that are surrounded and in the church that will make demons flee i'm quoting from 63 11 17. amen instead of that it's become a laughingstock what is it the mechanics instead of the dynamics oh my we're working on it working on it and working on it and reworking on it and we we're working on we've got it all i'll tell you what we've seen message preachers take this message apart and put parts here and there and you know hook quotes together and next thing you know we lose the true oneness of god that brother branham preached there is a true oneness come on other yeah we know there is a false oneness but there is a true oneness amen i'll just tell you this there ain't no two lords there's one lord one faith one baptism one god and one father of us all but we've had some quack mechanics that want to try to tinker with the church until the church can't run in the power of the holy ghost anymore of the backslidden people are sitting on the pew until our children don't know the god that we're supposed to know in his life-changing power oh yeah brother branham told us the supreme that that that you cannot get to first base unless you believe in the supreme deity of the lord jesus christ so we get it we mess with the mechanics to the car won't even run and there's no dynamics to make it move oh yeah and brother brandon said and i'm quoting again and he says our educational system our denominational system has taken the place of the holy spirit leading the church our great fine training of ministers and things has taken the place of all night prayer meetings oh yeah and the old-time way we used to get to god i told you i'm reading i'm reading see i'm reading from 63. now instead of having preachers we got lectures men who knows the word just as well and they can sit there and put it together in such a way that's astounding how they do it can do it they know the mechanics but that ain't the dynamics we want to we want the dynamics i don't care about the mechanics i want to know the dynamics what does it do i don't know how that car runs out there it's got pistons and cylinders i don't know how much pressure you use the only thing i know is that dynamics put her out there and drive it and that's what we know god made the promise i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy how is he going to do it i can't tell you i just know want to know the dynamics of god's system that's the main thing what shall i do with jesus called christ he says let me say something this uniting time and we see them we see them uniting all these coming out these spirits that are moving uniting together gonna change you know you're gonna change the the whole nation we see spirits that are loose you're not but it's uniting time for for god and his bride too he says i say this with reverence and respect i believe the bride of christ is called i believe she's sealed in the kingdom of god i believe the mechanics is there come on they're waiting for the dynamics that they take her off the earth into glory in the rapture i believe it with all my heart yes sir we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it he is the dynamics and we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper and we're waiting watching for that their big church is to be united the dynamics of this church will be anybody ready for this a refilling yes of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and that body unites together the full power of the holy ghost will raise her up exactly like that even the dead that's dead in christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his holiness and take a flight to the skies the dynamics is the holy spirit [Music] the dynamics of this church will be a refilling amen you need it i need it even the prophet said he needs it amen we all need it amen and amen there it is we got china russia north korea they're all threatened getting ready to pour out destruction rumbling every day they're getting ready to cleanse this earth before the millennium with atomic fire amen they're going to pour out atomic fire on the earth read your bible and you'll see it amen but there has to be another outboard amen i said there has to be another outpouring in the world falling apart brother branham said the hour that we're living oh god the world is falling apart that hangs in the hangers bombs hangs the things that will do it just exactly the church is ready she's sealed in ready to come there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab that church and take her into the skies exactly because the church the word the bride and his ministry christ is ministry is in the bride which is body the supernatural body spiritual body of his here on the earth and his spirit is sit there living his life right out until him and the church becomes one in the wedding hallelujah big outpouring and you're in the middle of it hallelujah you're in the middle of it amen that's what's happening right now you're in the middle of it oh yeah we can look out here we can see what's happening where a demon invisible demon is coming into this round and people are scared and running shutting down schools and churches and homes and and business and everything and wrecking the economy with an invisible demon but i want you to know there's somebody greater and i saw another mighty angel amen he has come down from the heavens and he put his foot on the land under the sea and say satan you cannot rise until i take my bride out of here hallelujah oh church don't be afraid don't be worried i see another mighty angel we see what the devil's doing we see the enemy at work we see his attack on our homes and our family but i see another mighty angel hallelujah only christ it could be can i tell you for the last 50 years we've had an outpouring of the mechanics but if there isn't a dynamic spark to ignite the gas it might as well be water you can say brother tim this with this theology we've got we've got message theology in this it's got oh my it's octane is so high it's indescribable but what good is all your word word word that you poured into the church it's just theology until the holy ghost comes about it and quickens it that'll bring you in harmony with the word that'll bring you in harmony with christ a people that has his potential amen but what god's looking for today is somebody that'll call him on the scene he can't work until you begin to cry oh brother tim that's pentecostal well that's what brother branham told us in seed not air with the shuck and jeffersonville in 1965 he said we have become like buzzards vulturing down on past manna and we don't know how to fly in the heavens anymore where all things are possible to them that believe come on amen and he said there's no more prayer meetings no agonizing with god to fulfill his word the church has become soft and lazy they just want it handed to them it's time that people begin to call on god amen begin to say god move on the scene we're here in the last age the last time and man trouble is all around us everything is uncertain more than it ever has been and it's time for people to have passion to have a desire god i want you more than i've ever had you i want you moving and i miss amen i want you living in our church i want you healing or sick i want you to save the lost [Applause] we're so backslidden we don't even know what an altar call is anymore one of the very last things that brother branham said before he left and leadership was i want an old-fashioned altar called here ain't not sure he was against the altar call of patting someone on the back and saying your mother died don't you remember you know and and getting them on an emotional thing sure that's what he was against remember he said the way i got it so we i got down the altar and they beat me on the back till something happened i mean why don't we balance some things out anymore and realize friends an old-fashioned altar needs to come back to the church with some real repentance and a calling on god i'm tired of being lukewarm i'm to be in your image for the bride will not be lukewarm she will be passionate about the word and passing it for god [Applause] amen when you hear of others being filled with the holy ghost it ought to put a burden in your heart i want him amen don't pass me by you hear that he's filling others with the holy ghost you ought to be saying god refill me [Applause] oh we want to take our little eaglets and help him out of the shell you know help him crack the shell a little just say brother branham's a prophet just say i believe all the seals are open and they are and and you know just say uh you know you bleed the message and we do but that ain't nothing more than a billy graham intellectual easy believism amen you need a dine out to sin not coming back to calvary and dying out to the old man and be born anew by the holy spirit come on that's exactly right amen oh you know brother branham said this let me just let me say this politics this is seed not air with the shock politics voting in voting out saying this now the other and the holy spirit has no more right away in the church than nothing can you imagine i heard that one church actually voted on whether the seventh seal was opened how ridiculous is that what if you voted it wasn't open did that close it amen even if you voted it was open did that open it no you know it doesn't change what god did in our generation if the seventh seal is not open the seventh angel meant nothing to brother brown amen you know i know there's a couple of quotes that says god wouldn't permit the seventh seal to be open and brother branham thought he had said too much about the third pull because god had told him i'll just say nothing enough so he went to motel the next day after preaching on the seventh seal and record a new ending to keep it ambiguous but after his death william branham evangelistic association released the original seventh seal and did you know there is over a hundred times he says all the seven seals are open over a hundred times all of them are open the seven seal was the breaking of the silence we're not in the days of the silence anymore we have heard what the seven thunders uttered what were the seven thunders they were not the virtues they were the revelations contained in the seven seals that's what the thunders were about amen we know now what it was god hid it in symbols and he's now revealed it why to be to usher in the coming of the lord to hand you an open book amen so that you could see so you can see what you possess as a child of god amen now now of course you see the the seven thunders brought us we can't begin with the word coming to a prophet the shout and now we're we're here where the seventh angel has sounded his message he's done his job he ran his course amen and it's now the days where it's the voice of the archangel which is christ come on amen and there is a bride here in his image who under their messenger is the final voice to the final age where the word that was preached is now taken on flesh hallelujah and it's produced a bride in his image and they are the voice of the resurrection i was dead in the tombs of darkness and the tombs of religion but now i am alive forevermore and you'll never seal me back in a denomination again hallelujah i once was dead but now i'm alive is that your testimony this morning then you are the voice of the resurrected one and the voice of his power and in his resurrection there's healing deliverance and salvation hallelujah and our little eagles can pip their way out of the shell you don't have to help them out with a lecture amen are given a little instruction or some kind of intellectual conception but they'll knock on that shell they've got a little hammer beef and they hear the lord will we will sing god i want that salvation they hear i'm the lord that jesus i want that healing for my soul lord i want you to deliver and they begin to peck their way out they get a little fresh breath of air brother it just makes them even peck a little harder amen i believe we're getting the fresh breath of air it ought to make every one of you push out push out against the world push out against some belief brother adams once on to say in this quote i was reading about voting and he says no more prayer meetings no more agonizing with god to fulfill his word no more believing that the word is still the same yesterday today and forever they just vulturized down a denomination put their name on the book that's lazy and soft set back they're gloating on some kind of dead carrion supposed to be at least a hawk or similar brother to the eagle the prophet that brought the true word and manifested it relies on half-rotten man-made theology words to get it some man-made sunday school program sheet some educator killed for him back in some seminary somewhere you know we're not happy with the way the prophet brought it so we got to write our own books are you with me amen we got to have our own messages amen tell them the days of miracles pass there's no such thing as the baptism of the holy ghost all this nonsense you mean you can tell me that an eagle would eat that he couldn't do it neither will a christian eat on a dead carry him from that old denominational doctrines they want the fresh word of god fresh amen the promise of the hour god promised rabbits in the days of luther he promised other things in the days of others oh now listen but now he's promised us a full square meal the full seven course menu for all the seven seals are open and everything is ready for the word of god to those who can receive it is that the way you feel this morning amen i want the full word of god i'm tired of just having part i want everything god made a promise a pride in his image a people who is like him amen let the musician come let's just worship the lord just a moment oh my we could preach a lifetime telling testimonies and things as we went it's taken up some time but let's just look now let's just look see where we are in time see where we are in the promise let god speak let him speak to you today don't you want to be a people can be used of god the holy spirit can move in your life you can just be quickened by the holy ghost to lay your hands on your child next to you and see that child healed don't you want to be a kind of person that believes every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god that sees god working in his church the people say that brother that sister knows how to touch god i want them to pray for me i want to be a bride in his image be like him anointed with the same anointing jesus used me oh lord don't refuse me [Music] once you stand together with me you've been sitting in a while you just talking over with him this morning what about you aren't you
