were up it brother wrong Spencer's had some wonderful meetings there God just moved in tremendous ways just speak in the hearts and and revealing himself in in such a wonderful way you know what words just can't express when you see God come in and move upon our audience have on a life we had 33 of our people here from evening light that went all the way over to the Shenandoah Valley and was there you know it made me feel like a celebrity it really did amen so god bless you thank you for coming and being there and supporting that meeting it's a two-day journey to say the least and man we're looking forward to a great time we're going to be having our October meeting second weekend of October I'm pleased to announce that and while I was gone it was arrangements made that the Japanese believers two of our translators are coming and so a total of four of them going to be here at the meetings and we appreciate the work that the brothers have done in that nation of Japan to see that the light of the gospel is spread were that less than 1% or Christian are Christians so you know they are they're these some of these are worked with us very closely to translate into the Japanese language of course we also have Chinese believers over there that are doing the same thing for their Japanese counterparts so you know God has got to work all over the world and as I think of that we've heard from Norway we're going to be having believers come from there from Europe brother David Mayer will be coming from France Belgium area so Switzerland area so you know it's just gonna be a great time gathered together amen so what a day that will be when we have those meetings and we look forward to that so good to be in the house of the Lord today amen and I am just happy to to report brother Craig Bohr has made it safe into Connecticut and settling down there so you know we're gonna miss him but you know there are other sheep we have there's not of this fold so there's many many around the world that needs help in these blessed amen let's sing the song is Jesus on the inside working on the outside what a change in my life aren't you glad for the change in yours well it's Jesus song [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] they talk for that change a man will you turn with me to the Leviticus chapter 26 we're gonna read from the first verse this morning right down to about mo verse 11 or 12 so we just thirteen actually is where we'll go to but I want to read from Leviticus for our opening scripture today is we just prepare our hearts to for the Lord to speak to us at the conclusion of my message today and I'm not going to speak long because I want to give time for this this is something we've been waiting for a long long time and we have been waiting for the testimony to be completed that we have recorded of sister Alana butts who is healed of Hodgkin's lymphoma and and we we have made a making a DVD of that of course and putting it on a living God come just to testify what God has done amen because we know he is the same yesterday today and forever amen he's still God he still meets the needs of his people don't matter where we are what the situation is I have in my hands today to prayer cloths one is going to go to over into India and another is going to go into Nigeria where requests have come in for desperate needs or that they needed touch from God and I'm believing for for Daniel and also for so long that is in India Daniel in Nigeria and and Shalom that is in India and we believe that God will bring a healing to them this is according to Acts chapter 19 that they took aprons of cloths from the body of Paul and we're not Paul but he's the same Lord Jesus laid him on the sick and the devils fled from them and they were healed amen so we're looking today to the Word of God and for the promise of his word a man to just be manifest among us Leviticus 26 verse 1 you shall make you no idols nor graven image neither rare up a standing image neither shall you set up an any image of stone in your land to bow down to it for I am the Lord your God you shall keep my Sabbath's and reverence my sanctuary I am the Lord that's what to hear today for us to reverence his sanctuary this is a commandment of God you shall keep my Sabbath's and know that we don't worship on Saturday we we worship on Sunday because of the resurrection for we are declaring that he rose from the dead on the first day of the week but we are here to keep to keep and make holy this day in remembrance of him and to reverence his sanctuary and I don't I can't think you know how could we show dis reverence by not being assembling together with the rest of the believers worshiping God I think that's really a part of reverence if you walk in my statues and keep my Commandments and do them then I will give you rain and Dew season and the land shall yield her increased and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit and your threshing shall reach into the vintage and the vintage shall reach into the sowing time and you shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land safely and I will give peace and the land and you shall lie down and none shall make you afraid and I will read the evil beast out of the land and neither shall the sword go through your land and ye shall chase your enemies and they shall fall before you by the sword and five of you shall chase on hundred and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight amen and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword for I will have respect unto you and will make you fruitful and multiply you and establish my covenant with you and you shall eat old story and bring forth the old because the new and I was setting my Tabernacle among you and my soul shall not abhor you and I will walk among you and I will be your God and you shall be my people I am the Lord your God which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt that you should not be their bombs Minh and I have broken the bands of your yoke and made you go upright amen let's bow our heads just for a moment father I'll hold in my hands today these two prayer cloths that will be going to little hearts little believers Lord that are desperately in need of touching from you and today Lord as we send forth Oh God on the wings of this prayer we send forth deliverance in your name because you said in my name they will cast out Devils amen and we believe that word Lord we know that no enemy that can that's can stand before us and no weapon shall prosper Lord oh god this is this is the inheritance of the saints none that is formed against us shall prosper and the enemy will have to flee before us because you are mighty Lord and your word is true I pray God that you'll bring healing and deliverance to your children today around the world wherever they are and whatever needed to have is they hear this message today may lord their hearts just be turned into joy knowing that there's a mighty God on their side today in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you you can be seated man good to be in the house of the Lord once more you know I as I was contemplating this service today and as I've been traveling for the last several weeks and and coming back to home and of course the many catch-up things that you have to do coming back home it was with the with the Baxter family in their time of need and different situations that arose but I was i yesterday as I I'm looking at perhaps something else - Minister bong I was sent the same video clip of from three different people that wouldn't would send it actually all of these came to me personally from either South Africa or Africa and they were showing up 240 Jewish people making their Aliyah and they were returning to their homeland the Land of Israel and one of these Jews who were interviewed said it's about the Bible coming to life about the in gathering bringing the Jewish people home and when we're all together in our homeland that brings the most light to the whole world and of course you know I believe that we are a spiritual counterpart that as the Bible would speak of Israel as a nation that God he speaks of his the the election tiles as a people that is called out for his namesake and so therefore you know as we look into the promises of God some of it may apply to Israel physically but it all applies to us in the spiritual manner it is ours to believe and receive and this will return to their homeland is nothing short of miraculous we do have returned to homeland and that is a homeland of of the Bible hey man you know when I think of the homeland of the Bible that is a place where miracles happen where great things happen for God's people where salvation takes place and deliverance happens when when you are in your homeland of the Word of God and of the Holy Ghost and I believe that you know as we are think about it today I can hardly think of even this place without thinking of how this church was built on the miraculous you know and because it's built on the miraculous uh you know we we can expect God to do extreme things because God has done some extreme things in this generation to get our hearts to believe in you see it is promised according to Malachi 4 that he said Behold our sins you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and he said turn your hearts back to the faith of the fathers and I believe we're in that hour of a great restoration and a renewing of the Holy Ghost you and this building around the world wherever you're hearing this message today I want you to know this message is one of deliverance it is a message that will bring freedom from slavery of sin it is a message that will give light in the time of your darkness that there is nothing that is too hard for our Lord a man and as I said that you know we we are here in the last age of the Gentile dispensation in the seventh and last the Laodicean Church age when God is showing his great power raising our faith he has to do that to prepare us for the great rapture we believe here that the rapture is not just something we talk about or just a funeral scripture that is given for comfort but we believe that it is real and then it is alive and there is something that will take place in our generation you say well brother Tim they have looked for this for 2,000 years but yeah we are traverse now seven church ages beginning from Ephesus down the Laodicea and we are now here in the end time and all the signs showed the end time never has there been a time that the world could burn with fire with just with just a few pushes of the button yet the Bible prophesied that it would happen never has there been a time like it has been again the repeat of the days of Noah and the days of Sodom which work both hours of destruction and I'll tell you we are in a time of where that there will be great destruction come upon the earth but for that time God's going to rapture out of people and I'll tell you that is the promise that we'll look for we cannot put our I hope into anything else man we appreciate good men that will stand for righteousness but I'll tell you all the men you can line up we'll never turn the nation back to God and then because it is prophesied of this end time that it's all coming down to the end but there it is not the end for you it's only the end for the devil it's only the end for his kingdom it's only the end for his children but it's not the end for you it'll suddenly beginning for every child of God we can look forward to that promise but while we're here we still need the miraculous working power of God and as I said this church was built on miracles you know I was established as I had thought back and I had to go look up the paperwork to see but we six years ago we bought this property here and we just and it was there that we would decide to build a church and would move from Cleveland parish over here and of course many of our folks is not from Claiborne parish there they're from Webster they're from Boger they're from Caddo they're from Louisiana Mississippi and Arkansas and you know many other places that will gather in here today and and be in the service with us many are connected across the world that some of some settings that won't wouldn't be able to attend church but they're able to be in service with us today amen but it was about it was about seven years ago now that brother Gary stanky here right - raise your hand brother Gary and I want you to stand up god bless you it's so good to have you again these folks come down from Manny Louisiana Drive in two hours to be in service and he said to me one day brother Jim he said a church alive is worth the drive a man aren't you glad to serve a living God is because he's among us is why we have life but brother Gary stank he was hospitalized because of a blockage in his colon the good the doctors did surgeries to remove it but he went a total of three weeks without food and he was in a dying condition as the stomach would not digest food and he had a an experience while he was in a hospital just seemed like you know he reached a very low in weak point and in that moment every kind of demon started coming into his room he had this horrible not another sleep nightmare but a nightmare where he wasn't asleep and all these Devils were howling at him and threatening to take his life and to be quite honest with you when I heard of that I I thought you know brother Gary's a man passed 70 and if God wants to take him a man that's a great deliverance we believe in life after death man we believe in an instant health once we cross this veil of sorrow amen we believe that he would move right into a new theophany body man and add but however I'm we're not wasn't afraid of him dying but we just didn't want the devil to torment him it is right a man for a child of God to be haunted and tormented by the devil I'm just telling you today it isn't right it isn't right if you're tormented if you're afflicted it isn't right quint jesus paid it off hallelujah what we're thinking like Jesus I just read the the the sign up here let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus and Jesus didn't think it right command of the sick that they would not be healed the blind that their eyes would not come open or the crippled will not walk you said I won't happen in this day you can come too late to tell me I've done seen a Living God I'd see them in the power of his resurrection if I've seen him heal the sick batsy to take the loss and save them that takes her life that makes a new creation in Christ hallelujah why just yesterday one of our evangelists brother Darrell Ward came back from Poland and they sent him a report said as you walked off the platform brother Darrell a man was standing there with crippled and he said he had he had died his canes there that he had to walk with and you stopped and prayed for him I want you to know that today he don't walk with canes anymore he walks normally and healed God just working in one person is God working in a body ministry around the world a man but he had that brother Gary had this experience where demons coming in his room and it made me angry I'm beyond the sweetie it just made me mad you know sometimes you just got to get angry with the devil man how many has ever been so sick and tired of being sick and tired that you're sick and tired of being sick and tired maybe you're that way in this moment maybe there's a habit in your life a situation that is there a problem in your life but you've got to get the point where you're sick and tired of being sick and tired of being sick and tired of being sick and tired you got to become you gotta come to the place you no longer want to be in bondage anymore hallelujah but in a way I got angry and I'll tell you I walked into that that hospital room that day with my wife and you know the story I texted brother Timothy and I said pray with me before I go as I go in and he said dad remember we're right in the book of Acts in not what the churches to do in that the last commission that Jesus gave the church marked 16 these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they will cast out Devils in my name they will speak with new tongues in my name if they drink any deadly thing it won't hurt them come on and they'll take up serpents and they will not harm them and he says his disciples I give you power to tread on scorpions and upon serpents and nothing by any means shall harm you I'll tell you there's so many precious promises that lies in this land that's what I'm preaching on today is a return returning to the land of promise but the Gary's voice was so low you can imagine he had natan 21 days the doctors would later tell him you were dying and I drew up a chair beside his bed and he began to share his heart about having a place for people to come and where they can stay even overnight and one of his great concerns was the young people and others not having a place to stay where they could go to youth meetings he said I'd be willing to help any way I could if we could just do something and I'll tell you whatever he said please the Lord because I knew when it happened the Holy Spirit dropped right down in that room that day it gave me that gave me gave me the words to curse that devil by that evening he was I think it was that evening not there early next morning he started eating a little bit of jell-o and a little bit of this natin immediately he started on the road to men and did the process of healing he's returned back to health again [Applause] because of this I knew I had a mandate from God to do something we were landlocked and we were as I purchased this property for the church and and the decision was made for a new building and we saw a miracle after miracle after miracle to follow until we're right here today a man with a building that has completely paid for and since then we've been building our youth activities building and we'll own no debt on when we complete it and we hope that'll be soon amen that is completed but we have learned together through all of these times the power of unity and believers agreeing together when you see this video today that we're going to be showing in a few minutes and I'm conscious of time I know because it's it's a the testimony is has some a little bit of link to it but it's worth every minute of it you've got to see it but we've learned the power of unity and believers agree and together and and and this is a result of a believing Church standing together on the end the breach for the need of another jesus said in Matthew 18:18 verily I say to you whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and again I say to you that if any two of you shall agree on earth and touching anything that they shall ask and it shall be done of them of my father which is in heaven amen God has done so many great things in our age to enable us to believe he's done it not just to show off but to to enlarge our faith to believe for the impossible why would start 1946 with an angel of God coming to a man by the name of William Branham and that was spirit that was causing a divine healing movement and him would come would come men like all Robertson and others that would go out and preach that God is a healer and God is a deliverer and God has taught us to believe in the impossible in fact Jesus words in mark 11:23 he says for verily I say unto you that whosoever are you one of them that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but believe that those states which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith can you imagine that God that gave you that power as a believing Christian a man to proclaim his words and take his words and put in your mouth against the enemy and that would that we can have whatsoever we say that's what it is in that what Jesus said my Matthew 17:20 said for verily I say to you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing somebody say nothing nothing shall be impossible to you notice this it didn't even say nothing is impossible that God said if I can get you to believe if you will start believing and confessing and standing on the Word of God if you take me at my word nothing will be impossible to you what a promise that he is now God wants us to know that He loves us and then all the time he just drops his little love gifts along the way a man you know I realize the Bible said God so loved the world and that's often that's awesome that is awesome that is an awesome thought the world but when I'm throwing I look at it I have to bring that personal to me God to love me you know the word really doesn't mean anything unless it becomes personal God so love me and I am of course I believe that's why that he has brought us back to the land of promise in order to show his love to us he wants you to know you're his beloved you have been chosen in him before the foundation of the world you have been selected and hand-picked by God you have been called in ordained to a purpose what before the world began he knew you and he calls you and he put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah oh it's down to the altar sometimes that we realize who our real father is of where we really come from but God had this a long time before we knew about it he already plans your coming he knew exactly what your need would be he knew exactly what to provide for your salvation and your deliverance this God is a God of purpose he's a God with a plan and he's got a plan for your life today first John 3 and 1 he says behold what manner of love have the fathers bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when we saw he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is another translation would say it this way see what great love the father has lavished upon us I love to think of that God wants to lavish upon his children I'm a no good thing will he withhold from you our man the trousers give an exceeding great and precious promises all of these Wayne what manner of love the great love the father has lavished on us that we should be called the children of God and that's what we are the reason the world don't know us is because it didn't know him hey man oh yeah when he came they didn't know him and man when and he said the world won't know you either a man but nevertheless he says what manner of love I was bestow I lavish on my children you know sometimes do we get the thought somehow another that God hates us and God wants to destroy but God doesn't hate any of his own man you know what man said to me one time in the counted as I sat down and was discussing with him my taxes and and he said to me he said you know brother Purdy's that I just don't believe a loving father would send any of his children to hell I said neither do i I said there won't be on one of his children there hallelujah amen all of those that are begotten that God will never be in hell hell was not even made for you hell was made for the devil and his angels it wasn't made for the sons of God a man and he said what man of love I wouldn't lavish on you or if you're a sinner today and you're away from God and you don't know him let me tell you he wants to lavish love on you it's all I'm greedy he'll take gifts away in that away listen he he's not wanting to take away he's wanting to add to you man he's wanting to add to you oh yeah you know you may take away your smoking your drink in your line your cussin and you're doping in your adult horizon and you're fornicating and your homosexual lifestyle and he may take all of that away but all you replace it with so much more this will be the greatest trade you ever made in your life to change to trader your sins for his righteousness Zechariah said he he for he that touch of you touches the apple of his eye that's what he thinks about you the apple of his eye you talk about love God wants us to know that He loves us man I'm looking out across the audience today and I see brother Kenneth the middle didn't hear god bless you brother Kenneth he shared with me a testimony the other day but I just want to just talk about him just for a moment you know brother Kenneth is he's a he's one of those real Christians hey man there's something really real about him and but there's been a lot of love lavished on him amen you know the Bible and I tell you I believe he loves much because the Bible said if you're forgiven much you love much hey man and brother Kenneth is a young man he was a Christian but he fell away in the sin and straight away from God many years later he came back to God on his bed crippled unable to walk without a walker I walked into his room that day of the hospital and I said you know Kenneth there's still hope for you he said is her brother Jim I said yes there's hope I said God's a God of mercy he'll bring you back to him that day we prayed with him and and of course you know he again he was a broken man crippled unable to walk most the time wheelchair bound but because of his terrible sin Layton pass he struggled with being forgiven you know there's I want you to realize forgiveness God is God that will forgive and he not only forgives but he forgets in the first place this is the God is merciful of mercy said as far as East is from the West I'll remove your sins from you what a God and what a savior and but because of his terrible sin Lillian Pratt has he struggled oh god do you love me and one day he was sitting by the phone and free and just telling the Lord Lord I love you you know that but I just like to hear you say I love you you know sometimes that's the way it is we tell God all the time we love him but we just need that assurance we just need that little special touch and he sighed and got up from with his Walker and painfully struggled to the refrigerator to reveal his mug with tea or coffee whatever he's drinking scooted his mug along the kitchen counter praying the same prayer over and over Lord I love you and you know that but I just like to hear you say to me I love you could you do it please this once and finally with difficulty he puts the mug along the counter back to his chair praying as he went reaching the chair he sat down and say Amen and was about to take a drink out of his mug and he said the phone rang I happened to be in my barn that day am doing morning chores and the voice of God spoke to me and said go and call Kenneth and tell him these words I love you and I quickly ran to the phone and I made a call and said Kenneth I don't know what all this is about but God just spoke to me these words and I know it was him and he said to tell you these words I love you and he began to shout and have a revival filled with assurance that God did indeed love him hallelujah but God's got many ways of letting you know he loves you man in my he would go to the cross and give up everything and but give them all of heaven just to show you how God loves you we find that in Zechariah 2 it says for this is what they Almighty God the Lord Almighty says after the glorious one has sent me against the nation's that have plundered you whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye what a wonderful scripture that we quote again the apple of his eye mom we don't have to look at ourselves as the scum of the earth and the down-and-out and nobody loves me you know we all goes through those things sometimes I was there with Amanda and Caleb's little children and you know some of the children was there at the Lakeside and they were of fishing and and the littlest one back there I wanted to say you know I never get to fish and since what you know will you let me have a turn so what my sister would never do it she's she's bigger than me and she never gives me anything and you know I you know she don't ever treat me right and she don't even say she's sorry when she does things she was just feeling so down and out mate trying to make us feel so down and out so we'd give her a fishing boat when she got her chance but you know that's why did we want to feel loved sometimes we want to know God loves us that he cares about us that he understands our humanity that he's able to reach further down than what we can even look up this is the kind of God that we serve aren't you glad to serve Him brother Kenneth spoke to me this past week he said I can't wait for you to get home and he said I was gonna let you get home and tell you this but he said since you called me on the phone said I got to tell you and he said you know four months ago the doctor said he said I had cancer in the blood Leukemia Lymphoma and it spread to one-third of my bones and the lymph nodes and my stomach was so large he said his stomach had swelled out and the doctor said hey that might burst and spread to his body any moment and doctors told him he had cancer in 50% of his body and the doctor put him on a little small pill to boost his immune system but he he has had no chemo or radiation two weeks ago now it's been a little over two weeks now he went had a doctor's visit when the doctor came into the room in the examination room he came in smiling and he says you know having this test in his hands he said I want to let me let me shake the hands of an awesome man he said wow wow wow wow said your bloodwork shows there's no cancer hallelujah time to understand the ELSA doctor again about the cancer the doctor said quad cancer there is no cancer it's gone and I can't explain how he's gone but he's gone said your left nodes are normal now you know you know a year ago just before just about this time of the year just before our October meetings brother Kenneth laid on his deathbed they were calling in the family who called her son his son Brian all the way from Montana because he was at the point of death and he's calling the family but I preached that morning old that we are the sons of God a man and that there there was a power that was in the blood that would heal and deliver and that we only needed just to claim what God gave us in his promise hey ma'am and so me and the ministry team went down that day to the hospital here in Mendon and we gathered around him and I said Kenneth we just spend we just so we just been praying when we prayed for you this morning but we come together to lay hands upon you and believe together in this hospital room that God will do the miraculous you know just because the doctor gives you that don't mean God gives you it God is the one who never lost a patient hallelujah even those who we called died just go into life they live in a greater life than we are here are you with me Amen but brother Kenneth I I said now I said now what I want you to do is I want you to ask me in you to say what your desire yes because whatever you say God's gonna give it to you and he spoke out he said I want to be in church on Wednesday night we had Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday meetings he never missed a one of them he's had service he's had I don't know how many heart attacks thirty stents in his heart he's got a record number of stents thirty Stenson his heart six balloon procedures his heart was only operating thirty to thirty five percent and the doctor told him it said furthermore he said my examination is it shows you that your shows me that your heart is now operating perfectly he said he explained the heart is a muscle and that this just does not happen it does not reveal itself but your heart is restored in I don't know what's going on but this just don't happen what's going on [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] thanks be to God I just want to tell you restorations on the beginning I'm believing of a complete cold deliverance total deliveries in this land of promises the land of our father this land this land the promise is the land of Samson if you can't find it find me I meant to do this but find me that that that picture of Moriah for a moment here and I just I want to just talk about it for a minute because we have returned to the land of promise in the land of promise it was a man by the name of Samson he had long hair because of a Nazarite vow it was uncut this land of a people and I wanted to say this is a land of the people who are under a Nazarite vow in other words they are holy unto the Lord they're set apart for a purpose that's what Christians are supposed to be a people set apart from the world a man identified with him their holy unto the Lord and they are to show they are different from the world in the way they dress and the way they live and the way they act Samson of course departed from the promise of the land because he tempted sin and finally was lulled to sleep in the lap of Delilah and his hair was cut and he lost his power with God you know Delilah was and they're the Philistines won't know what is the secret of your power Samson and I want to remind this church what is the secret of our power it isn't because we're better than somebody else it isn't because we're more intelligent or we got a room more full people with great college education standing a world knowledge and her great great great man's out of the world that's not the source of our power our source of our power is our relationship with Jesus Christ and I'll tell you what that's a that is what a good eye is find in the weak jellyfish of a young man or young woman that cannot resist the evils of the world and the Holy Ghost will put us find in them what they think it stand for righteousness and stand for truth but you know Samson laid his head down in the lap of Delilah and she discovered his secret and that it was his covenant with God which was represented in his seven locks that he was separated unto God there's a Nazarite you know what happened Samson was blinded and imprisoned made to grind at the wheel to grind for the Philistines but one day been taken to a festival for the gods of the village team to celebrate victory over Jehovah he returned he returned his promise and he began to think about the Lord and he began to reach back and he realize dumb Philistines and let his hair grow out again a man and his glory was returning and with it his power now you see the reason I'm preaching about this I believe we're in the land of Samson we're in the Bible and we're Bible promises come to life Amen that their proper sign of an endtime people or people who who will who will be restored back to their power after the church that's lead in the lap of Delilah for so long and sold their virtues and the church has done this they sold their virtues with programs denominational ideas and I didn't thoughts of man and then I think they come to the point that they're so politically correct about everything they lost their virtues but I tell you I believe that God is restoring the glory to some men and women to the power of God who realize I don't have to sell myself out to the world I can stand for Jesus and just let the world go by I can here brother Branham say and God send us another church just before the end time that the power of the Holy Ghost can come into her and the demonstrations of the Spirit and March 16 can follow the church acts 2 and 4 acts 2:38 and all of it would be following right along with the church signs and wonders accompanied that apostles great signs of his resurrection accompanied them while we're in prison surely God's growing a crop somewhere for the last kill may it be you my Christian friend here this morning may your strength the may it be your strength has begun to grow and I pray this message this morning out in the land the word this will go I trust this message will help bring the vitamin to your system that'll grow a spirit of power back into your life again hallelujah a man here we are Mariah Pruett had alopecia the day and and this wasn't the worst up and it went right on down until her hairs were gone from her head she prayed she was prayed for huh I'll never remember the service we were in the old church in Claiborne parish and I was preaching about 1st Corinthians 11 and the hair being the glory of God for the woman and how that she's a Nazarite unto the Lord and as I preached those scriptures and then spoke of those things I look back out there and I saw a girl with a just a handkerchief on her head that the devil had robbed her of her glory shame that embarrassed and all of this a young girl but that day we call her down to the altar there and I said you know God put this in the Bible that women were to have long hair and it was her glory and the devil has wrapped this from this daughter of God but we're here to cast Satan out we gathered around and prayed for her that day and faith began to work within her heart and then if I can I will I do believe that jesus heals me now come on hey man and they came over and Easter just some months later on this little bald-headed Mariah with a holding three little hair pins in her hands walks there in the prayer line and says some other Timothy I want to wear these what was he doing she was staking her claim in the land of promise a man she was takin her claim in the land of promise somebody with me somebody ready to stake your claim were you Mariah stand up right here all right they see us right in front of me god bless you hey man what is this Oh God can restore the glory a member consistent for clay vandal and the promise is somebody with me now I'm telling you friends I look more than just for a little girl to her glory start I look for the glory to be restored to a New Testament church people who walk in the power of God people Daniel because God is God because he abundantly loves you and he has a passion for his people he's a God who cares who said cast all your cares upon me for he cares for you remember God never forgets a promise hey man what time got started well then you're wondering what time I'm finished hey man I almost feel like John Paul Jones right now I just started to fight you say God never forgets a promise you see Israel but language down in Egypt for 400 years but God hadn't forgot when the time a promise true nod that which God had sworn Abraham the people grew and multiplied and Egypt and God sent a deliverer in preparation but the time is promised God began to move he would he would prepare it for it by sending gifts on the earth to prepare for his coming and for their return to the land and so God would do the same thing here there's got to be a time of preparation where a hearts are turned back to believing again and the first section is Godman send the Prophet visited him with a pillar of fire in a burning bush and spoke to him giving him the message of the Exodus with a message to Pharaoh let my people go and if you don't I'll pledge yes until you do you know I think sometimes it's time to just turn the tables on the devil with Jesus come that's what he did him a devil scream at his presence they screamed out and said what have we doing with you that son of God the religious men we're calling him a devil and the Devils were calling him God sometimes theologians don't know and nearly as much as what they think they know you see it would be them that would reject our the Messiah then I wonder today if we just need to come down in humility and realize that God is God the Bible said the Lord is never slack according you know concerning his promise as men count slackness you see the the angel came to Zechariah the father john the baptist's because he refused to believe and God said his mouth to keep him from uttering anymore unbelief and I think sometimes for because of our own foolish talk and compared and negative confessions God needs to shut our mouth that's what I bring God shut my mouth don't let me say anything that would be against your word that's what a negative confession is I want to confess God is real God is true God is merciful God is a healer God is a deliverer that's what I want to confess man I want to confess that he is my righteousness that he became my sin that I might become his righteousness so therefore I'm holy because he's holy and I'm righteous because he is righteous you see this time you know where where the these words were I had to be full filled in their season and I believe God's got words that are being fulfilled right now in this season I believe we're in the season of revival ever a season of renewal refreshing from the presence of the Lord because Peter said before Jesus comes back that there would become a times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord and I say I want to be a part of that refreshing a man because the words of God are fulfilled in their season you said well why didn't it happen when Paul said we which are alive and remain some two thousand years ago well thank God for the sovereignty of God and then hills for knowledge because Vidur happened then you wouldn't be here right remember God has let it come right along until ever name that's on the Lamb's Book of Life will be manifested on the earth and what's that last name is manifested on the earth and dipped in blood he'll call it to a halt you say why why would God have names on the Lamb's Book of Life because God knew you were coming and he made plans for you man this is what Jeremiah said in Jeremiah 29 I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you a hope and a future a manager you know Joshua he would say to Joshua have not I commanded you and this is the Lord commands early be strong and courageous and be not frightened and do not be dismayed for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go a man you see we're know that we are we are to speak faith and speak very positive of the promises of God you know you sometimes weak and false I'm weak and faith but we should never say this we should say this instead Isaiah 40 29 he gives power to the faint and to him who has no might he increases strength and then then he would say in verse 31 but they the weight of the Lord shall renew their strength and they shall mount up with wings like eagles and they surround and not be weary and and they shall walk and shall not say hallelujah not you know let me just tell you today we we must women we must not be passive about this we must have a passion about it and that you don't stop for nothing that you keep moving forward someone said one time if you can't fly then run and if you can't run then walk and if you can't walk then crawl but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward amen so what I'm saying to you so crawl until you can walk and walk until you can run and run until you get fried but whatever you do quit sitting there in your unbelief in your pouch in your fear get up from there and move forward you never never never never give up you never quit believe it you say brother Tim where does your street come from it would be said in Exodus the Lord is my strength and my song and he has become my salvation this is my god and I will praise him my father's God and I will exalt him where is your strength the Lord is my strength how can you lose when God is on your side DL Moody said if a man hasn't been partner with God he better have some big plans and I believe that God wants us to have big plans and plans to overcome plans rise above plans to excel plans to move forward this land we return to is a land of miracles it's a land of the Living God you know where he says I'm the LORD thy God that healeth all thy diseases we read in Leviticus chapter 26 and verse 4 he said I'll give you rain and Dew season and the land shall yield her increase and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit so this is a land that will be one of constant revival the land of renewing the land of refreshing from the presence of the Lord it is a land of plenty for he says in verse 5 and your threshing to reach into the vintage and the miniature reach into the sowing time and ye shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land safely no man what is God saying to you Amen you're not going to have any luck I'm gonna supply all your knees your threats since I'll reach through the wine vintage and the wine vintage sound of sowing time and you show you two bread to the floor I mean we don't have to look at our lives as being half empty come on we can look at God would support out into us his fullness jaunt in and tear he said I have come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly and that word abundantly means exceeding any number of measurement Ephesians 3:20 tells us of his ability he is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we think or ask or think according to the power that worketh within us why is that so important to know what he is because he says in Deuteronomy 20 and 4 for the Lord your God is he who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies and to give you the victory are you with me now this is why he goes before you to deliver you from your enemies and give you the victory hallelujah that's what it means to save you to give you victory God's not going to happen to feeted people he's gonna happen overcoming people a people who believe so we have returned to a land of miracles where he heals all diseases a man he says in verse verse 5 and your we read that on the threshing floor let's move on down to verse 6 and I will get peace in the land you shall light down and none of you none shall make you afraid and I will rear the evil beast out of the land and neither shall the sword go through your land so look at these promises I'll rid the evil Beast out of the land listen and this land Devils are cast out Jesus any man ever where he went he called it sickness Devils come on man their sickness of the soul that's in there is sickness of the Spirit that's depression there is sickness of the body and that's all manner of diseases and the principle work of the Church of Jesus Christ is to rid the land of beasts i'ma never spirit that will exalt itself against a word of God we are given a commission not to live with them but to cast them out that's what we stand as the children of God Exodus 15:26 he said if you will diligently hear the voice of the Lord your God and do what's right in your sight and give ear to His commandments and keep all his statutes I will put none of these diseases on you which I brought on the Egyptians for I am the Lord who heals you do to remedy 32:39 now see that I even I am he and there is no God beside me I kill and I make alive I wound and I heal nor is there any who can deliver from my hand I'll tell you when God gets after the devil they no hope for him Alleluia amen when the Saints get to pray and things happen and then this is the land of Hezekiah who is sick unto death who the word the Lord said thus said the Lord the God of David your father I have heard your prayer I have seen your tears and surely I will heal you and we can take that for our families that are need of healing our children that are need of salvation amen situations in your home and the problems that are there that we can look at and just take that to our own selves it that he has heard our prayers that he has seen our tears and surely I will heal you hey man this is a land of David where he would say in some sturdy verse 1 I will extol you O Lord for you have lifted me up and have let not let my foes rejoice over me O Lord my god I cried out to you and you healed me O Lord you brought up my soul from the grave you have kept me alive that I should not go down to the pit sums 103 is a exceeding great precious promise verse 2 that says bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgives all your iniquities who heals all your diseases who your life from destruction who crowns you with loving-kindness and tender mercy who satisfies your mouth with good things so that your users renewed like the Eagles the Lord executes righteousness and justice for all who are oppressed are you press this morning he executes righteousness and judgment for you that are oppressed verse 1 of chapter 107 verse 17 fools because of their transgression because of their iniquity is worth like to their souls abhorred all manner of food is he and they drew near the gates of death then they cried to the Lord and the trouble and it saved them out of their distresses he sent His Word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions oh that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men that's what we're here today for we're here to give thanks back to God for something great he did among us a man showing himself as a healer a man showing himself is delivered we see him from proverbs 3 and verse 5 trust in the Lord with all your heart lean not on your own understanding and all your ways acknowledge him and he shall direct your path don't be wise in your own eyes fear the Lord and depart from evil it'll be helped to your bones or help to your flesh since trick to your bones it would be Isaiah that would see him coming our delivers on his way surely he would be he had borne our griefs isaiah 53:4 and it's carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten by God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement for our peace was upon him and by His stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all it would be Isaiah 61 that would prophesy of him saying the spear the Lord is upon me because the Lord anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor he sent me to heal the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and open and the prison to those that are who are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our God and to comfort all that mourn I say what a savior we have today a man the healer is in the house and that's why we can proclaim what Jeremiah said in 1714 heal me O Lord and I shall be healed save me and I shall be saved for you or my praise Jim I would say in chapter 30 in verse 17 for I will restore health to you and heal you of your wounds saith the Lord because they called you an outcast saying this is ioan no one seeks her verse 6 of chapter 33 sym behold I will bring health and healing I will heal them and reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth Hosea 6 and once has come and let us return to the Lord for he at thorn and he will heal as he was speaking but he will bind us up after two days he will revive us on the third day he will raise us up that we may live in his sight let us know let us pursue the knowledge of the Lord his going forth is established as the morning he will come to us like the rain like the ladder and the former rain to the earth this was a land of victory this in this land of promise I'm come battle and the promise now they're making their Aliyah they're coming back to Israel we're coming back to our land of promise the land of the Bible where miracles happen what people are changed four sons are saying what men and women can be filled with the Holy Ghost the very power of God unto salvation man this is land of victory verse seven said you shall chase your enemies and they shall fall before you by the sword and five of you shall chase a hundred and a hundred of you should put ten thousand to flight and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword a man it's a land of no Berenice where he makes us fruitful Leviticus 26 and 9 for I have respect to you and and make you fruitful and multiply you establish my covenant with you and man these these promises are laying in the word there shall be no miscarrying or balan in your land I will fulfill the number of your days 7:14 or Deuteronomy you shall be blessed above all people there's something no male or female barren among you are among your cattle sons one the 13 and 9 he makes the barren woman rub bide in her house as a joyful mother of children praise ye the Lord hallelujah all I believe that don't you I believe in a church that can give birth to newborns power of the Holy Ghost that we don't have to be barren and unfruitful but we can see people filled with the Spirit of God and life seems by that power because he said we would not be barren hallelujah we will not be empty but a people filled with the Spirit of God Oh Bert's general 26 said and ye shall eat the old store and bring forth you all because of the new I'll give you fresh revelation in verse 11 and might I'll set my Tabernacle among you and my soul shall not I've you and I will no walk among you and will be your God and ye shall be my people hallelujah oh I remember it says in the Bible blessed are the people whose God is the Lord I'll tell you you are blessed people today because you serve a mighty God he's a mighty Conqueror that hell could not hold him down death could not contain him that thing could not hold him but he rose that is a try for God and he's coming back again for people who have made her separating and until he comes we're gonna lean on the everlasting arms hallelujah hey man they get ready to start this film right now I want you just to say we've been waiting now for months on this for years several years on this man sister Lana I want you to stand brother David you're here I want you to stand this is her husband we have no reason to fear anything now when we got a God like ours now the David's a medical professional profession he knows what it is to have the diagnosis his wife had oh yeah there was those times of desperation when he got down on his knees fell on the floor sobbing and crying and God heard their cries they leaned on those everlasting arms I want you to listen today is I encourage you to do the same thing lean on those everlasting farm arms there's nothing for you to dread nothing for you to fear we can have perfect peace with a God like ours Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever [Music] [Music] we made an appointment with my primary care physician who had ordered the allergy testing to start with and she just I told her about my cough that was going on and that had gotten worse I told her about the fatigue that was bothering me the aversion to food and about just overall malaise that I was dealing with and she automatically just ordered a chest x-ray I showed her the lumps on my chest and she thought it might be in the rib cage in the bone and so she decided to order chest x-ray and who wanted it kind of a strange angle that actually shows the bone structure as well and fell so I went to the hospital and had that done and David was in there with me when I had the x-ray done and when he saw the x-ray he was very alarmed because the hole right long area was totally white and being in the medical field himself he's seen x-rays many x-rays before and he knew that this was not just a little cough problem anymore and so um the next day the doctor called me in she fed Elana she said I'm looking at your report of your x-ray and she said I do not like what I'm what I see here and she said there's a mass in your lung and she said it looks like cancer she said now I want you to see an oncologist but and I she said I can't say for sure that it's cancer I've been wrong twice this year I sent somebody to an oncology and call oncologists who thought it was I thought it was lung cancer and it turned out that it was not it was a strange infection she said so I could be wrong on this but I do want you to be prepared that it's quite possible that this is what is going on here and so you can imagine the shock that we felt at something that we felt was probably just going to be a routine checkup and some pneumonia or something like that and so this was a Friday and we had the weekend to digest this information and so we let family and friends know I called my mom and told her and she she said Elena she said you can tell me these things before they escalate to a point like this and I said mom you've known everything that has happened I said you know as much as I've known but I didn't realize either I had no idea it happened so gradually I didn't realize that these symptoms were all together pointing to something that potentially so anyway and we we told people in the church and they began praying and things and um we didn't get very much sleep that night as we considered the possibilities of course your mind just tends to go very extreme in a case like that and so David was up walking the driveway 3:30 the next morning and it was actually very hard to look at each other um during that weekend because you know that it could be something that would take you away from each other and um it was something that's actually indescribable unless you've gone through it but I just I just felt like God is God and I felt like this time I could trust him and from the beginning I made a decision that I was going to look to the Word of God and that I was not going to fear this thing and of course you cannot stop the thoughts that come into your mind at a moment like this but when they would come in I would say but the Word of God says he's a healer of all my diseases and so Saturday the next day we sat down with our children in the living room and we told them we said they've all been raised in a Christian home they you know from the day they were born and we said this is what the doctor is found it could be an infection and it could be cancer and we believe we're believing for it to be an infection but we said if it's not God is still God and we're making a choice to just believe him we're not gonna fear this thing we said all the shouting and praising the Lord that we do in church all the singing that we do it's all about this moment we've not had huge trials in our family and if this is our moment we're going to trust God and we're gonna be real soldiers and do it with all our heart and so we were talking to them and David said some things to them along the same lines and the Holy Spirit just came down in that room and it brought such comfort to my heart I've always wondered you know we have a lady and a couple in our church who has who lost a child and through sickness and heart problems and I wondered at the time how do they walk through this with such dignity and in that moment I knew how you do it because God is a comforter such peace in my life I felt at that moment so we just talked with the family and prayed together and then everybody went away and then David went outside and proceeded to mow all 20 acres of our property I was concerned about the trees and everything as he just digested all of this and started to fight his own battle which is unique to somebody who works in the medical field but I was texting a friend later on and I told her I said I can walk through anything if that presence is with me like it was today but this time there was a banker that have been missing the year before so next I was scheduled to start seeing an oncologist and so I did that we went to my first appointment and he asked me of course about all my symptoms and all of that and I just as as we were there he just said I don't think you had lung cancer and I said oh so you don't think I have cancer he said no I don't think you have lung cancer he said your symptoms don't fit that he said perhaps lymphoma he said perhaps tuberculosis or some infection like that we really don't know and so we're gonna start running some tests so they did a whole series of blood work you know vials for blood work and and started doing some testing and ordered a CT scan and that showed up that I had a lymph node swollen under my arm which turned out to be 2 or 3 centimeters in size but I didn't know about it was deep enough and so he ordered a he ordered a biopsy of that lymph node now as I said I've never really had any procedures done or anything and just the thought of that was very unnerving to me and I just I told people I don't do pain you know they sound uncomfortable I don't do pain you know and so it was everything from the ground up was a new experience to me and it was very frightening at the onset and I just said God I'm looking to you for everything that I go through you will be with me whether I feel it or not these different hospitals that I'm being sent to in different clinics they're all they all have their own atmosphere and many of them are not atmospheres of faith and you kind of feel like you're you know the only one in there but that that believes but somehow I just believe the Lord would be with me and now and then I did have a really nice experience with somebody who was a Christian the lady who drew my blood at the oncologist that she drew it she said we're just gonna pray that every one of these comes back negative and it would just be a very positive thing in your day as you were fighting your mind battles they did the biopsy under my arm they did a bronchoscopy where they went down and biopsied inside my lung and did some took some cultures out of there to test for infection they were very perplexed by my case because my symptoms didn't specifically match cancer or infection and meanwhile I was just feeling worse and worse all the time Mike off had gotten very bad and then I started to have a weight in my stomach almost like when you're expecting a baby that is so I felt like I needed to stretch out like this a lot of the time and at this time I can only figure that it had something to do with my lung not wanting to expand properly but my appetite was just I had no appetite whatsoever as they did these different tests everything came back negative they just were as I said very perplexed by it and finally they decided that I needed to have a lung surgery called a vat done where they go in from the side and they take pretty impressive wedges out of your lung and test that for infection and for any sort of cancer and so meanwhile my mom having found out that I had the mass in my lung decided to come visit and she lives in Canada where I am originally from and so she decided to come stay with me if only to cook because if I cooked my own food it made it that much harder to eat it so um she came and stayed with me and started helping with the housework and helping with the children because I was just becoming less and less able to care for myself and just losing interest in life in general and so um she came and stayed with me and and so when I had the surgery she stayed with the children and the surgery went very well and they did some testing during the surgery and found out that there was nothing everything was coming back negative and so after my um after the surgery was over I had a follow-up appointment this by now we're into December from October to December they were doing all this testing I'd seen a couple of pulmonologists different pulmonologists and was kind of being passed around from one facility to another while I did testing the day that I went in to have my surgery done of course this was a bigger deal even and the other procedures that I'd had done and naturally I wasn't looking forward to it and I read a sermon by William Brennan which is something that I do regularly because I I feed on those sermons they're a lifeline to me they're so inspired by God and and he was speaking about Satan and he said Satan following you along that great big king kingly priestly colide trying to scare the liver right of you but you're fortified by the word and as I went in for this surgery I said yes that is exactly what it is this Goliath is trying to scare the liver out of me and I refuse to bow to that and I have the Word of God that is going to protect me no matter what I go through and that is what I told people when they'd asked how I was doing I would say I feel rotten I have no appetite and God is with me and God is my healer and that was my confession throughout this entire or deal and it wasn't what I always felt but it's what I always believed so a week after my surgery I had a follow-up appointment by now we were into well into December and so when I went there the doctor said he said we've sent you're the cultures and biopsies and things off to the University of Michigan for a second opinion on them and he said I don't think you have cancer he said maybe you'll have just an interesting infection named after you and it was kind of a light-hearted conversation but it's very positive he said those results will take about two weeks to get back or could take up to two weeks and so I left and the very next day I had an appointment at another hospital and this was a follow-up from a previous bronchoscopy that I'd had done it was a lesser test and we already had gotten all the results back from that and everything had been negative on infection and so we actually thought about not showing up for that appointment and just calling and cancelling it because we were past that into the bigger surgery but decided just to keep the appointment and these this pulmonologist had been in contact with the surgeon who had just done the major surgery and they'd been talking back and forth about the results so David and I went to this appointment at hospital and the appointment it the wait was very long the children were at home waiting for supper and hours were passing I felt as sick as a dog I would get up and walk around to feel a little better and then I'd sit down trying to feel a little better and I was just feeling bad by this time I was having severe sweats where I would just soak through a whole layer of clothes just when everybody else was freezing and so I was sweating profusely when the doctor came in he sat down and he said so you've you've gotten your results that you have Hodgkin's lymphoma and I just stared at him I said no I said I think that was being considered but they've sent the results off to the University of Michigan and it will be a few weeks before we get them back and he said no these are the results from the University of Michigan they just came in and he said you have vodka and some FOMA and he had assumed that we knew this and I was just in shock I could just feel my face just turning hot you know moving up and David was just staring at him and he started to talk about what Hodgkin's lymphoma was classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and he said it's the good news is that it's treatable he said you should regain back lung function and he said we treat it with chemotherapy and radiation and he said your doctor your oncologist has been informed and about that time David's phone started ringing and it was already my oncologist calling him and we were just stunned and he said you have any questions and I said well I just need some time to digest this I I guess I just need to think about it before I come up with questions and he said I'm sorry to deliver this news to you week before Christmas and I said well no you can't help that we drove home and he said you can you talk to the kids cuz you tell them what you want them to know okay we went in and we told the kids we said the doctors have talked to us and they've told us I do have cancer and we said this changes nothing we said what we told you about this situation at the beginning is what we hold to right now is that God is a healer we are not gonna fear this thing we said mama mama might get really sick for a while and we need you guys to be the very best you can be but you know things might look a little rough around here for a while but we're gonna just work together and we're just gonna trust God that everything's gonna be okay and my mom had actually gone back home when I'd had this lung surgery after it was over she'd gone back home we thought oh we were gonna get I was gonna take some antibiotics and everything was going to be fine and so she had not planned to come back but we we called her and let her know what was gonna happen what was happening and told the family in the church and in and so that just opened a whole new chapter for us the oncologist wanted to meet with us right away after after everything this diagnosis so the next day we met with him and he sat down and she gave me the papers with what drugs I would be receiving he told me that I would probably require radiation because the tumor in my lung was about seven centimeters big and he said with that tumor burden that's how he referred to it he said usually we do radiation but because of its location you would actually be injuring the breast as well and a lot of times women will end up having breast cancer from the radiation years down the road if they're young enough to live that long and he already had three patients who had that problem from having had radiation so he was hesitant to do that but yet felt like it might be necessary regardless he said I would need the full regimen of chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma he said it was Stage four because it was already in an organ and he said that would include 12 treatments two weeks apart and it was four separate drugs he said they'd recently switched out one drug because it was better on the lung than what the previous drug had been and this was a very recent development although it it had been studied for a few years but that was good news to me because my problem was literally in the lung and I didn't need more problems in my lung as well but he just said I'm gonna sit down and tell you what you can expect with chemotherapy and he said when you've had enough you tell me because this is very overwhelming information and I understand that and we can pick up another time if you know when you've had enough so he started to write down the side effects that I would deal with and how I would feel this day and you know just launched into it and it was just surreal really you picture other people going through this sort of thing but you never picture yourself in that situation but somehow when I came away from that appointment for some reason I actually felt a little better I guess unknown can be more fearful than being told exactly what to expect and he is a very gentle very gentle doctor and very kind and understanding and so he just explained what to expect and I realized that he does this every day and anyway somehow I came away not feeling like I was going to make it I I don't know how to explain the fact that you can feel like you're on a runaway cart while you also feel like God is in control and so after that I was put through a series of tests I had to have my lungs tested to see if they could stand up to chemotherapy they did a heart test as well they I met with a doctor to have my port put in which they would use to put the chemotherapy into my body and all of this was just of course very a lot to take in in just a couple of days especially when I thought I was going to go on antibiotics for an infection and so that we received the diagnosis on Tuesday met with the doctor on Wednesday before Christmas and had appointments the next day and so by Friday it was a first day for me to be home quietly since my diagnosis I hadn't really had a good cry about it I hadn't had time to think much about it but that day I had some time to myself and it started to sink in as to what was ahead of me and I was feeling very sick already and I just felt like I would not be able to fight you have to fight through chemotherapy and I thought I don't have fight in me I'm already sick and tired of being sick and tired and so I was overwhelmed by what was ahead of me and frankly I started to become frightened and I was just thinking about it and I just thought I cannot do this I said lord I know you're gonna be with me you said you would be but I don't want to go through it and so the next morning David was doing some work in the garage and I went out and that's what I told him I said David I just I started to cry I said I don't want to go through this I know God is gonna help me I don't doubt that for a second but I just don't even want to go near it he said I wish I could take some of it from you and I said I wish you could too I was desperate at that point but um he just held me for a few minutes and I had a little cry and I went back in the house and I picked up my phone and there was a screenshot that Naomi will send a girl in our church and sent me and it was a little potation from a sermon called hear his voice and it said don't be scared honey God is watching you the devil may try to do something to you but God's greater and it was taken from the sermon where William Branham was talking about Marion putting Moses in the bulrushes and that's what I felt that's how I felt at that moment is that I was launching out into something way out of my control and way out of just beyond anything that I felt like I was prepared for but yet when that came through on my phone phone I knew that was God that caused her to send that to me and I felt it was supernatural just like reading about the girl healed of Hodgkin's lymphoma I knew that was a supernatural moment because we serve a supernatural God and He will be there for you and whatever you go through and in your most desperate and dark times and I felt that found that for myself it just gave me courage once again to know that he was gonna be with me so this was Saturday the following Monday was Christmas and it was the strangest Christmas of my life I felt as sick as a dog I saw on social media everybody's celebrating with their families and I felt so strange I felt like nothing in my life was recognizable anymore nothing in my body was recognizable anymore and I almost didn't know how to interact with my family because I thought what if I am to be taken away from them there's there's all these thoughts that go through your mind you know but I just when I'd have these thoughts I would just turn from them and say God you are my healer you said you'd be with me I don't know where this is going to take me but you said you would be with me and that's I kept going back to that and kept going back to that I thought I'm gonna be a real soldier and a real child of God and I put my trust in the fact that he loves me whether I was feeling it at that moment or not he's his promises to his children are full of love and compassion and so that's what I trusted and in those moments where the things life was very overwhelming the day after Christmas I went in for surgery to have my port inserted into my shoulder area and when I got up that morning on my phone there there was a scripture I because I have the Bible app and it was Isaiah 41:10 feared though not for I'm with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yea I will help thee yea I will uphold thee with the right my right hand of righteousness and I felt like God gave me that scripture for that day and that is a scripture that carried me through my chemotherapy I posted all over my house and read it daily many times a day sometimes I will help thee that when I needed help I'd say God I'd hold him to it I think God you said you would help me and I am looking to you for that help I need it this moment and that day that morning when I went in for surgery Beth Adams a girl in our church sent me that same scripture she also had the Bible app and it popped up on her phone and she sent it to me and I set out of the mouth of two or three witnesses it was like God in an audible voice with telling me I've got this and we're gonna be okay [Music] the next day was Wednesday I was scheduled for a PET scan and that shows where cancer is located in your body because they knew it was in the lung but they didn't know where else and they didn't do it prior to this time because insurance will not cover it unless they already know you have cancer and so I went from my PET scan and I came home I was there a few hours and I came home and I was resting from that because they give you valium and David came home from work he said doctor the doctor wants you to come in and start chemotherapy today and I was like here we go okay let's go so I got up right then we left the children at home and we went in for my first chemotherapy appointment every treatment I took David and I just prayed over it we we'd always said if it ever came to the time when we had cancer or anything we probably wouldn't take any more therapy we we discussed it a few times I would hate to go through that it just wouldn't be worth it but when it was when I found out I had cancer there was no question in my mind that I was to take the chemotherapy I did not feel like I was to take the radiation and I felt from the beginning that that was not an option for me and I didn't tell the doctor that but I told other people I won't be taking the radiation I'm gonna trust God with that part that he'll take care of that so we prayed over the chemotherapy treatment that it would go right to its mark and do it it was supposed to do and that I would not have to deal with horrible side effects and I always am amazed that in the Old Testament God would say to the Israelites the diseases that come upon the other nations will not come upon you and the things that they deal with it's different for you and I felt I'm his every every bit his child as much as what those people were and so I can have expectations that I get special treatment not because I'm better than anybody else but just because I'm his child and that is not unique to me it's just unique to his children and that's something that I began to just believe for myself so they told me each treatment is gonna you're gonna feel a little worse they put a little bit more of the medication in every time your body it's very foreign to your body and your body's not gonna like it and so they said you could feel progressively worse with each treatment a lot of medications to help me get through the treatments the stomach problems that they expect you to have the nausea to ward off any vomiting and things like that they tell you're gonna feel very fatigued you know they just prepare you for all sorts of things and they actually don't prepare you for everything only the top five and so um I went home and it started a whole new cycle for me because not only was i dealing with lymphoma I was also dealing with the chemotherapy treatments and so by this time I was so sick that I was talking very little around the house if the kids wanted to know can I can we go here can we do this I'd say ask a bath daddy that's about as much as I wanted to say I did not want to make decisions I'd lost interest in all of that I cared about my kids but I could not I felt too sick to even make basic decisions with regards to them and then like I said there is all sorts of other things that started happening literally from the moment the chemotherapy goes into your body you start to notice things and I just began turning these things over to God you know they said watch for tingling and numbness in your fingers and in your toes for neuropathy and so when I'd start to feel the tingling I'd say god I can't do anything about this but you said you would help me and you said you're a healer and I'm praying that you will take care of my extremities my lung by this time felt like it was made of lead it felt like there was no expansion in it it got worse I would get up at night and I would when I would breathe in those first few breaths when I got out of bed at night it felt like the breath came out in in three pieces it was like and before it would really start coming out normal and I felt like it was scraping over bones I don't really know what to this day what was happening but it felt like it was scraping over something inside and it was very frightening in itself and I just thought I am NOT gonna worry about this I cannot worry about this God you created my lung I believe that you're gonna heal it and I would go to the restroom do what I had to do and go back to bed and just go back to sleep and that's what I did all day every day when I had to eat a meal which was one of the most horrific things that I dealt with during this entire time was having to make myself eat and I would say God just get me through this Emil help me to get it down because I've got to keep this weight on by the time I was at the end of my first treatment I was I had dropped about nine pounds from my pre fitness weight which on my frame who is very significant and worrisome I no longer was recognizing my body the way it felt even sitting on a chair was uncomfortable and it was overwhelming and I said God I'm looking to you to help me with my meals to help me gain weight I was um at 2,000 calories a day I was still losing weight I had to get over 2,000 I had to get 2,000 calories to maintain weight at least and to gain it was more like 2300 calories a day and I was doing nothing so my body was just working through an unbelievable rate and my mom spent a good part of her day trying to get fat into me she would pour oil over my lasagna she would give me a glass of orange juice with oil in them I would have cereal with heavy whipping cream on them we would just do anything we could to make to get extreme amounts of calories in small amounts of food because I could not take in large amounts of food so my bathroom started to look like a pharmacy with all the medications that the doctor given me I've never been one to take more than one ibuprofen at a time thankfully I've been very healthy and rarely needed it and I hated to even take any of the medications to keep things moving in my body and keep them functioning properly but I just said God even if I take these will you just take care of my body you know in the same way that I believe you are with the chemotherapy the first the first treatment left me it was very difficult on my body because of the lymphoma symptoms at the same time I missed the first three church services which were very difficult for me I hated to see the family go off and leave me at home but I just began to pray that the Lord would help me to be able to go to church and and that those were the only church services I missed the whole time I went through chemotherapy I made it to every single service after that sometimes I would be laying on the couch at two o'clock on a Wednesday evening and the kids that say mom you're gonna go to church and I'd say I'm sure gonna try my stomach is hurting so bad but I'm gonna try and but about three o'clock I'd feel a little better and I'd get up and get ready for church and heat a little something and I was able to go and I usually felt terrible while I was there but I it was such a lifeline for me and the things that would ministered wouldn't minister to me so deeply I didn't care who was around me but they administered that God is God is bigger and that you can speak to your Mountain I would stand up and I'd showed that's me Lord but I felt it so deeply because I'm his child and these things that were being preached applied to me in my situation and I knew it and I claimed it from my own and I knew that God was moving in my life and even though I had many doubts and many fears and may thoughts pass through my head you're not gonna make it to your 41st birthday you know and you got cancer for your 40th birthday and you're not gonna make it I had thoughts upon thoughts and that changed nothing I'd say Satan you are a liar those are your thoughts I believe the Word of God and I didn't always feel spiritual I didn't sometimes the text would come through and somebody would give me a scripture and I'd read it and I just put it down I couldn't even digest it and later on I'd go back and read it and say yes Lord that is true and it would encourage me the people in the church would send me cards with scriptures in them I would lay on the couch and just have them on the table and read them over and over till I had to memorize and the text that came through sometimes it was supernatural the things that it said would be exactly what I've been dealing with and so how can you doubt a God who speaks to you like that and he was so present in your worst [Music] gradually it got to the place I got through that first treatment it was very difficult but by the second treatment brother Tim our pastor sent a text to david and i and it was a scripture second chronicles 20 verse 15 and in it says the battle is yours but gods and I thought about that and I thought how can the battle be his if I'm the one fighting I'm the one who's down here just working away at overcoming this thing and getting through this how can this battle be God but I saw in the Old Testament where the Israelites dealt in a physical realm things that we deal with in a spiritual realm and I saw how they just had to call on God and say look what they're saying about us look with the enemy feet about us and he'd say go to sleep I've got this don't worry about it and the next morning they get up and their enemy was dead like they just all be dead on the ground and I thought God if you'd do that for them you do that sort of thing today because you'd never change the word says you never change and so I said God I'm looking to you to fight my battle well that evening I got a card from a sister in our church Mary Katherine she had told me when I first got fixed she said I will be sending new cards regularly with scriptures and written encouragement in them and that evening she sent me I received a card and it had the exact same scripture second chronicles 20 verse 15 the battle isn't yours but gods and she wrote declare war on the devil no no retreat and I you're telling me that you're gonna fight my battle and I don't know how you're gonna do it I don't understand because I feel like right now I'm the one who's going through all this stuff but if you tell me you're gonna fight my battle I believe you have something supernatural for me and from that moment on I didn't just believe for a healing I started to believe for something over and above something miraculous and the only thing that I could think of that would be him taking on my battle it was for him to take away the chemotherapy completely and I thought the only way that that's gonna happen would be for me to get a clear PET scan and I said god I don't want to put you in a box perhaps there's other another way you could do it because you're that kind of God you can come up with something but I knew that after four treatments I would have a PET scan and then I'd have no more PET scans until after twelve treatments are complete so maybe you have something else for me but all I know is I'm believing for something supernatural and that you're taking on my battle meanwhile I I started my second treatment and I began to lose my hair the doctor told me that by the third treatment I would have no hair left and so right before church on a Wednesday night I was brushing my hair and the first the hair brush came out full of hair and I just looked at that I took a picture of it I said this is gonna mean something to me like this is the beginning of something you know that I've never had to deal with before and I looked at it it would seem very surreal I already had this aversion to food and all of a sudden this was turning my stomach to be losing this kind of hair and I just got her to look at it hereand this and melon rudder so every time I brush my hair after that it would fall out I would braid it and I touch up here and it would all just come loose and it would be stuck in the braid but would just be loose I couldn't even keep my hair tidy during that time and so for the next week and a half my hair was just falling out constantly it became bald in the front and in the back first and so I started to wear a headband around it just to get me through and I'd have it just braided in the back loosely mom and I actually had a very funny moment one night I was getting ready we were about to go to bed but we were talking for a minute and I was sitting in the living room and I sneezed and my head just fell forward and we just laughed we said don't sneeze to her the whole braid is gonna fly off you know so we just giggle a little bit about that and then we thought this is really sick that we're fighting us the Solis but amusing but we did anyway one morning during this time I got up and written on the chalkboard was a scripture of debt every hair on your head is numbered my husband had written that his encouragement to me he stood by my side in all of this I told the Lord but I was going through this I said would I come out will you help me to be the best waves that I can be because of the way that he stood by my side and it all backrubs many times a day when my back would ache so bad from the chemotherapy he waited on the end in foot and he wrote scriptures on the chalkboard to encourage me that he'd read that morning when he got up to go to work and I believed that every hair on my head if the deed number I knew that [Music] [Laughter] thankfully my treatments were actually better than what most people experience they were horrific every day was a battle and every day was different the way chemotherapy cycles work as you deal with different symptoms at different times in your cycle and so you never knew what was ahead of you although you did recognize a bit of a pattern and after you'd had a couple of cycles of chemotherapy I was in the process of losing my hair it took about a week and a half for most of it to come out I I was avoiding washing it for a while because my scalp hurt a lot and because I knew that it was going to make a huge mess when I wash it because I knew a lot was gonna come out but finally I'd had enough and I washed it one day on a Thursday and when I was done I began to brush it and most of the remaining hair came all out in the next 30 minutes and it was a horrific process to really realize the finality of it I did not recognize myself in the mirror because there were strands still hanging down just at the back I looked like something out of a horror movie and it was a definitely a difficult process but I made a decision to ask one of the ladies in our church to come shave my head my scalp was quite tender at this time and she came over it saved mom and David emotional situation of having to be the ones to do it so the sister came over because she had done it once before to another for another that you had cancer and so I had a piece of my heart but my body hadn't quite caught up with me and I sweated the whole time I was having my head shaved soaked through the entire set of clothes she prayed before we did it and it was a beautiful prayer and very comforting and then she shaved my head while my mom cleaned the hair up off the floor and we cried together and it was over another short while and then I felt so much better it was behind me I felt clean bald head is better than a few strands let me tell you it's a lot less frightening I felt clean and good and I felt like I could move on so I began to wear hats I bought several different colors and things to go with my different outfits and I knew that God would restore my hair so as the days went on and I dealt with the things that you deal with in chemotherapy there's not a part of your body that doesn't ache itch hurt tingle burn there is literally not one part of my body that in some way was not affected by the chemotherapy or the lymphoma and so each day came down two hours and sometimes minutes to just get through that working to try to get through my food trying not to look too miserable I had stomach pains that were kind of unique to this kind of chemotherapy and the doctor did try different things with it but sometimes only certain positions would relieve the pain a little bit so as funny as it sounds coming at this time one of my kids would walk by my room and I'd be crawling around on the floor and they're like mom are you okay and I'm like just pray for mommy and I'm sure it had to be very frightening for them to see me act so strangely you know and there were a few nights I literally slept in a recliner upside down with my legs up the back of my my head and the foot of the recliner because it was the only position I could get comfortable in until all the blood drained in my head and then I had to change position but there was all sorts of non dignifying things that take place during chemotherapy and thankfully the Lord was with me oh and I would tell him about my symptoms over and over again I would say God I can't do anything about my lid long but you're my healer I can't do anything about neuropathy but you are my healer and I'd say I'm sorry if I'm repeating this too much but it makes me feel better to tell you about it and that way I won't have to overburden my husband with it and worry him more and he listened I knew he did and I felt this pleasure when I would trust him with the things I was going for I would feel him draw close and I told my dad who is not a Christian I said dad that you an angel is so close sometimes I can touch it I can almost touch him that's how much I believed that he was there but it did not make the situation easy it did not keep thoughts from coming in my mind lest anybody think that I'm super-spiritual or anything somebody said to me oh you'll make it through you're strong and I thought you have no idea I'm this weak as a kitten right now I feel like I couldn't I feel it's a weak as a kitten but God said he would be strong when I'm weak and that's what I was depending on anyway I told people I said this is Micah live I'm picking up stones and I'm about to cut his head off they're just something began to rise up in me and the more I fed it the more it rose up and the more pulsated and came out and it wasn't just me there was a whole church behind me growling around me they'd had people say to me I have my doubts too and then the Lord said this to me or show me this or this song came to me and I say I know it we're in it together and we're believing together and God is going to work one day my mom was working in the kitchen and I came into the living room to get something and she was there and I started to walk back to my bedroom and I turned around and I said mom I said I believe God is working in my situation I was thinking about that scripture brother Tim had sent about the battle and Mary Katherine had sent about the battle is the Lord's I said I believe God is working in my situation she said I do too I said no I mean something supernatural I believe God is gonna do something supernatural and tears came to her eyes and she said I do too we would share scriptures all of us would share scriptures the kids would write things on the board devil how a liar you are weed right yes that amen and things like that and we'd feed on that and I had cards from the church all strung across our fireplace and I'd stop and read them during the day and it would encourage my hurt all over again the church was bringing food by and doing many things to help me they had a food train we actually had a humorous moment one day when we looked at the chalkboard and it said appetizers it was a little chart and said appetizers and main courses and it said soup soup soup soup soup soup soup soup which delaney or eleven-year-old had written on there and that week we'd had a lot of serve podcasts we all kind of giggled at that we had some funny moments it wasn't all just heaviness after I lost my hair I well always on Sundays I'll start getting ready for church and inevitably about the time I close my bedroom door there's gonna be a knock from one of our five children and so I thought one day I thought I'm gonna get them so I shut the door and sure enough a minute later there was a knock on the door I said come in unbold and there's this pause and silence and then a little boy said oh that's okay and I was like oh didn't work you know but but we did get a laugh out of that and I did have a few ball jokes that I was allowed to say but the kids and David were not [Music] in thinking about um God fighting my battle I began to realize my mom had to leave to go back to Canada on February 28th she works in the accounting business and it was gonna be the start of tax season and so as she was not going to be able to stay and I started thinking about this he was also getting closer to the time of my my PET scan which they do after four treatments it's a way of monitoring how well your body is responding to lymphoma to the treatments for lymphoma they may also use it to decide whether they're gonna do radiation or how much and so um it's just a way of checking your progress and after that they just continue the rest of your treatments no questions asked and do a PET scan finally after your 12 treatments so it was approaching the time I'd had four treatments thankfully I had not that had the severe nausea and vomiting and things like that my fourth treatment I was going through a little Gethsemane not looking forward to it you know a couple of nights before that I thought I do not want to go through this next treatment I felt like I was still kind of recovering from the last one and and then I thought I don't have to accept it the fourth one's gonna be worse they told me they'll get progressively worse but I just thought I'm not going to sign up for that I'm gonna believe that this is going to be the best treatment and believe it or not it was it was my easiest one I can honestly say that so we went to church well to back up on Saturday February 17th I was getting ready for bed and my heart was so full of the goodness of God the things he'd done for me many of which that I've relayed to you and it was just overflowing and I was by myself and I thought God how can I ever thank you for your presence and all of this I know you're gonna do something supernatural for me but even beyond that just the way you've helped me and comforted me and sent things to me I know it's you and I know you're real and it just my heart was so full and I didn't know how to express it and I said how can I show people now while I'm sick I want to be able to show them how thankful I am to you and how grateful and that you're there for people when they go through a hard time I said I want to be able to express that somehow but I can't other than just in a text tell somebody God's healing my body and I believe his word or whatever so my heart was just very full in the next day February 18th we went to church and our pastor preached that God will do extreme things to get his people to believe and I knew I knew it was true I knew it was for me and my heart was so full what was [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Lord and that the musicians come man let's worship God this morning let's give it praises doing [Music] in your need I don't care how to judge how rejected you feel in the society that we live in how much I'm the lead to swallowed you up God is doing some extreme things to move your heart to face why don't you receive it now in the name of Jesus raise your hands right now to [Music] Ranger Ranger here now raise your voice to

after service we were just worshipping and thanking God I had to sit in an isolated area of the church the mezzanine seating so that I wouldn't have to wear masks during that time a mask is very warm and I just was it prevented me from having to I could interact at a distance so I was sitting up in the mezzanine seating with my family and brother Tim was singing leading singing and he changed his song to leaning on the everlasting arms and something welled up in me my heart was already so full and it just welled up that that's what I've been doing it's leaning on the everlasting arms and what a fellowship and enjoy divine and overwhelming to my heart and a little boys petite step out a busy I didn't know what I was gonna do and that Joey to come and go around the church there was such a determination people say my vote in my face was almost fiercely that I was so determined to serve God and to show the devil [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what you don't see on the video is the real atmosphere that was there you don't see the responses people started to rejoice with me after as they started to see what was going on there was a whole atmosphere there that you can sense some of it but not nearly like it was there and even after it was all over the worship that came out of my mouth as they dismiss people it was just flowing out of me such an expression of beautiful words that were just coming out of me and thanks to God for all that he was doing in my life [Music] so many things had improved but I still have many symptoms my my lung still felt like it was me to bled but I was not looking at that I said God you're my healer I don't know what you have in store for me I did not know even what the results of the PET scan would be but I just believed that God was in control and that he had something supernatural and I felt like this could be it because Mom was about to leave it just all lined up and because I believed I just believed God was moving so why not now I guess maybe was what I was thinking so I was I went into that PET scan and trying to read you know the lady who does the PET scan you're trying to read her reaction and she just acted the same as she went in when she came out I guess you're ready for your burger she said you know because you can't eat before PET scan and I couldn't read anything from her reaction so that was fine and I went home and the next day I met with my oncologist and David was with me and who went into the appointment and when he came into the room the doctor came in he said he was seen your skin and we said no he said um he said the cancer is gone he said the cancer is gone this is dramatic he said here come look community took us over to a computer and showed us a side-by-side to scan showing the mass of my lung that from the scan they taken two days after Christmas and then this was February the 19th skin and every spot of lymphoma every lymph node that was affected was totally clear the seventh centimeter tumor was totally clear from cancer the report was absolutely beautiful it was clear and he said this is dramatic and I thought yes because sometimes God is very dramatic [Applause] [Music] I just I thank God to this day that he spared me all those treatments I've been in contact with another woman who's going through this exact same regimen and the vomiting and the mafia that that poor lady is doing with I'm no special person I should have gone through that and yet God spared bats and every night before I go to bed I think in force very few because that was so very sick having some very tired of nothing and he gave me a special treatment just because I'm his child and because I believe him and that's something that he promises to anybody who will believe him I took him at his word and he butts right there to meet it and so the recovery actually has been rapid every day I've felt better and it was amazing how quickly my energy came back once the chemotherapy was over I wondered I wondered how long it would take for my lung to start expanding again and there's just been it's improved by leaps and bounds and all the chemotherapy side effects are totally gone you know I sometimes I'm going through my day doing the normal things of life and I can't believe that I feel normal and that I have food cravings that I'm hungry I haven't had not had that in almost two years a year and a half to two years I'd not felt in normal in many of these areas and I just thank God for his beauty and for His grace to me and I know that explains it to anybody else who believe it's work [Music] [Applause] [Music] the homily blessed be the name of the Lord Alleluia what a wonderful God we serve he meant no one when I asked her brother Dave and
