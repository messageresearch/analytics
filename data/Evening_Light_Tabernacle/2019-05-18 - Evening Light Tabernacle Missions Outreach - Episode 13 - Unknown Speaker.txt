========================================

well hello everybody were glad that you joined with us again today we are the ministry team at evening light tabernacle man we would love to hear from you if you have questions for us please contact us by information on the screen and invite your friends to join with us today as we talk about the changing of dispensations between the Jewish dispensation over to the Gentiles and how that we're coming now to the end of a nother dispensation which is a Gentile dispensation this parallels and things are happening very similar to what happened with the Jewish dispensation when they came to the end Timothy was there any warning that was given in the scripture about that what God would do at because of their bringing sacrifices that were blemished and not really putting their heart into worship and the coldness and the lukewarmness yeah it was we've been speaking about a Malachi's very interesting how he lines out how they're they're bringing the lame the sick and he says in verse chapter 1 and verse 8 he says you're offering things to me that you wouldn't even take to your governor right yeah you know and you're doing things to me that you wouldn't take to some king or you know here I'm the king of kings and he keeps going on down he says you know would you not come in would you there's a kid that firing up Kindle in my altar for nothing and he he says I'm God I haven't changed and it's what he said my like I'm God and I changed not so it wasn't God that changed it was their attitude to change he brings it all down he says verse 10 says there now I have no pleasure and you say that the Lord of hosts neither would I accept an offering at your hand for from or from the rising of the Sun even to going down the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles so it's showing right there and we saw it there it was when Jesus died that the ripping of the veil in the temple showing that no more is a woolly lamb accepted no no it did no good any more to offer a woolly lamb right but my name is gonna be great among the Gentiles praise the Lord God brought it over to us yeah that that's very awesome you know that's a thing that John came out when he came out of the wilderness and man was preaching and repentance and to prepare the way and and when he would see Jesus he would he would recognize him as the sacrifice saying behold our look yes the Lamb of God now this was totally unexpected in their day because they thought the woolly lamb that they were offering was in an acceptable sacrifice but now they are pointed to look at a new lamb that was come that would fulfill who's all the of what the all the other lambs had done and that his blood would be greater than millions of lambs that could be slain and so it would Institute a whole new sacrifice and a whole new blood that was a greater violence there's a there's another fulfillment which is incredible out of the prophecy of John I believe it's Isaiah 40 where he is speaking and it says that he shall come suddenly to his temple it's right in that prophecy of John and so Israel had much pride the Jews had much pride in their temple but God at the changing of this dispensation was changing temples now because when John baptized him he saw the Spirit of God to send like a devil upon him and it was there where he came suddenly to his temple and said this is my below I wonder whom I'm well pleased wonderful so now we have a new temple and this is now where God has chosen to place his name because this would be the chosen place of worship that's right everything is now moving to the Sun everything this the Sabbath is now going to be fulfilled in Christ when he says come unto me all ye that Labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest and that will now be fulfilled we will find our rest when we're laboring under sin we'll find our rest in Christ amen we'll find our forgiveness in Christ will find the feast days all in Christ now we're changing dispensation from the part to the whole from the shadow to the fulfillment what a wrist and a piece we have knowing that our debt has been paid praising our sin-debt swype Dwayne that was able to be paid in what way because it was no longer a woolly lamb that just rolled it ahead and covered up but it was a kinsman redeemer that came and I love what you said about the temple and he mentioned earlier about the temple veil being ripped showing that God was no longer in a brick-and-mortar temple yes but now who has come to dwell in these temples you know I just given a testimony in a junction in my time talking about the power of that blood that was shed one lamb many lambs you know but not one lamb when my son Andrew was born you know he went he was born he didn't he didn't have these surfactant as as long as he was gasping for air he was dying turning blue and they end up having to ship him to another hospital and so you know in that time yeah I'm dealing with you know I'm just just coming into the ministry been preaching maybe a couple of years and still really young in the ministry and you know the devil want to sit on my shoulder and accuse me you know what you must have done this you must have done that you must have done all kinds of things and and I was going to one more next morning after they've taken Andrew to the hospital and my wife was in the mendon local hospital and turn on the radio and there was just a preacher reading the scripture and you just said Abraham believes in God they just struck me I'm like yes abraham believed in God and I'm gonna believe in God son of Abraham amen and I got to thinking about Abraham you know under the lamb of the bully lambs in the Old Testament in that old dispensation of the Old Testament you know it lists all of his faults he lied he laughed he went down to Egypt when he was told not to do he made many mistakes but when when it changed and there was a new covenant that was made at the power of this land yeah none of this lamb no in that New Testament Paul Peter none of them mentions not one thought he made matter actus says he staggered not that's right exactly God and it gave me such strength you know during that junction of my life that I realized you know I'm not under the blood of bulls and goats I mean well Jesus and if I did do something wrong I say Lord I'm sorry it's done yes and it's gone and and and God just really gave me a lot of strength than that one realizing you know the power of this blood that we have that's right and so what happened to Andrew and Andrew just I went I went back after the Lord dealt with me in there as I was driving down the road went to my wife said we're not gonna we're gonna go this hospital I don't know what we're gonna face I don't know what difficulties lies ahead but I told her what had happened I said but one thing we're gonna do we're gonna look at a promise yes sir we're not looking at a wire we're not looking at a monitor we're not looking what the doctor says don't you know we're looking at a promise by His stripes that boys evil amen and in God healed as long as he brought him in just a couple of weeks turned it all around and today he's a healthy boy 15 16 years old and loves the Lord and and I make I make a joke he's allowed his kid I got Malone's amen because God provided a like man well you know Jesus would literally fulfill the Passover as he would become the Passover lamb you know he would he would actually observe Passover supper with his disciples and then become that Passover lamb himself during this time of Passover and Passover is the feast of salvation in both Testaments the old and the new the blood of the lamb delivers from slavery mmm the Jews from the slavery of Egypt and the Christian from the slavery of sin yeah so you know when you think about the 10th plague when Israel's are Egypt's firstborn sons died while the Death Angel passed over the Jewish homes with the blood of lamb on their doorpost in the New Testament Jesus is that sacrificial lamb and he was sacrificed on Passover in Egypt the Jews would would mark their house with the blood of the Lamb today the Christian marks his house his body the house of the Spirit with the token the blood of crisis of the past oh yes sir then represents our salvation and so Paul would say it this way in 1st Corinthians 5 and 7 turns out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump as you are unleavened for even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us so he is definitely our Passover so in that way he would actually fulfill the need of the blood of bulls and goats because in him would be as the true Lamb of God that it would be the blood of God that would take away all sins a man and this is a wonderful I've often made reference to this you know I had maybe a little child stand up in the congregation and ask the parents how many goats how many Bulls how many sheep it's worth the life of your child you know would it be 110 maybe 10 goats 20 30 see a hundred sheep a million how many would be all the sheep and goats and cattle and all the world will not equal the life of one but the blood of Jesus at least equals to life or every human being because the blood of God that's right so by one sacrifice he has perfected them forever who is sanctified beautiful amen so there were so many things that Jesus as he would take the government upon his shoulders and he would he himself would take the law and fulfill it as he said he did not come to destroy the law but to fulfill the law so like circumcision in what way was circumcision implemented and why was it and then how did Jesus fulfill it yeah circumcision began with Abraham and Abraham was actually a turning of dispensation in itself because out of Abraham come the twelve tribes of Israel and then would come the promises the entire Bible is actually based upon God's promise to Abraham and so this is where we go back and and find that the nation of Israel was born and God gave him a seal of circumcision which was in type we can talk about in a minute but it was the cutting off of the surplus flesh of the male child and as the law came they did it on the eighth day and Israel was identified by the circumcision and it was representing the coven that God had made to Abraham and so the New Testament speaks of a circumcision of the heart hmm yeah that Paul was speaking of that when Christ came this became a great dispute yeah among the believers because this this is a hard transition right this was a people that had been taught that was was taught on the breasts that God was one that the Jews are God's chosen people that he circumstance you must be circumcised he covered and and God remained one but the temple changed the Passover changed the circumcision changed yeah this was a hard turning of the corner for the Jews everything they ever had was black-and-white and rigid you do this you don't do that this is how God operates this is the law so when you're raised that way for not just one lifetime but generation after generation after generation and suddenly there's a change suddenly it was it's not that way anymore it's this it's very hard as humans to accept it yeah it's very difficult and I think we can all relate to that yes you know so Paul would say in Romans 2:28 for he is not a Jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of God so you know this this would tell us so circumcision today we are we're still we still believe in circumcision rights that's we still believe in a lamb right after in the blood that's correct amen and we also believe in circumcision so what is circumcision today it would be the cutting away of the world cutting away of the nationally desired fleshly desires the sinful desires and a entering into the covenant with God so it would be that would be the seal of the Holy Ghost right that's exactly so the Holy Spirit is our circumcision when you receive the Holy Spirit the life of Jesus Christ into you it cuts off sin cuts off unbeliever the signers of the world and you're circumcised from that and it's a circumcision of the heart right where that were and and it shows by the life that you live not just by the words you speak but also by the life that you live that you now belong to God the heart of his covenant st. man mm-hmm and it's interesting that the Holy Spirit how it circumcised is the heart because God is not working through a law to try to correct behavior reform behavior or change the the actions outwardly by law rather he's the Holy Spirit is circumcising the heart changing the desire for the world well for instance David you know in the in the Bible David was a king and of course the we understand he had five hundred wives so I mean one day he's upon the housetop and he looks across and sees a woman over there bathing while his men are out that babbling and he sees it's messy bah and he's a married woman and he goes and calls for her to come David did not need another wife right then you know and he knew better than to take the wife of another man this was a dull free and and this was better so he well known in the Bible thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife all of these things were written in the law and the Jews you know they had these things on the fringes of the garments you know frontlets before their eyes and Testaments on the doorpost all of these things to remind them to keep God's Word but all of these reminders was not enough to keep David in his time of lust you see because why hee-hee it was external but when the Holy Spirit comes on the inside it is the internal law it's the law written in the heart and and not something that is in stone but written in the heart and it's the change of nature yes so that when when a man looks upon a woman to lust after in his heart he has committed adultery with her already so there has to be a power yeah of the Holy Ghost yes gives overcoming power through the believer that wins situations like that arises that it gives him the power to turn his head to live right that's the that's our sacrifice you know the blood of bulls and goats that blood can only cover sin yeah if David would come off or lamb he'd come with lust or whatever it was he went out with that yes but that's what Jesus came and gave himself so when he died that because the life of that woolly lamb could not come back on right the worship that's right but the life of this lamb came since then that's the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit and this is what came on the day of Pentecost when God sent back his Holy Spirit right there's no longer covering that night it does away with it doesn't what you know you said that the Jews were known by that covenant of circumcision and I believe that today that we as Christians should be known there can I the baptism of the very good it should make a difference is you should be able to tell those men are circumcised versus those that are not because it makes a difference those on the day of Pentecost when they came out of the upper room they were different from the ones that hadn't been up there any of those that were not circumcised or Elstad from the nation of Israel and the only ones that will be in the body of Christ are those that are circumcised of the heart you know many of people look at the Old Testament and feel that grace overrides all the law of the Old Testament that ain't true what brother Tim just mentioned that Jesus said that he that you said in your law not to commit adultery but I say if a man look upon a woman and lust he's committed adultery already Jesus expanded the lost man he's magnified the law and all of us are dead by the law but when when we received the life of God changes the desire and now love fulfills what I love those when he expanded it he also provided the power to be able to live it that's exactly right yes yeah that's very good well in our next session we're going to be talking more about this I think this has been very edifying today to be able to talk about the power of the Holy Spirit and the circumcision and how that we are the Temple of the Holy Ghost I'd like to talk about some of that more as we look at Jesus fulfillment of the law and not destroying the law but fulfilling it and in this fulfillment how he is actually enlarged it and really gave you the power to live what you could not live so god bless you today and thank you for joining with us in this episode as we have discussed the Word of God thank you for joining the ministry team at evening light tabernacle for more
