[56:05] just want to say that I'm sorry about
[56:07] that but anyway we're happy that you're
[56:09] here God sees you um and uh I saw last
[56:14] last Sunday the dun family was here so
[56:16] we're glad to see them back in church
[56:18] with us pray that God just so revive
[56:21] their hearts and give them an anchor in
[56:24] Christ there is nothing like in Jesus
[56:27] and you don't want anything that anybody
[56:29] does says or Acts or behaves that would
[56:32] ever keep you from serving Jesus amen
[56:35] it's like I've said many times you know
[56:38] a lot of times we we have problems with
[56:40] people and situations come and even
[56:42] problems with the pastor of the church
[56:44] or whatever but what did Jesus do to you
[56:47] he ain't done nothing mean nothing but
[56:49] good amen I've had people hurt me and
[56:52] offend me do things that I oh my it it
[56:56] just stabbed me under my heart but you
[56:58] know what did Jesus do to me he did
[57:01] nothing good but good amen let's read
[57:04] from Romans 8:14 keep it in mind our
[57:07] theme who art thou a great Mountain Thou
[57:10] shalt become a plain and The Headstone
[57:13] shall be brought forth with shoutings
[57:14] crying Grace Grace unto it verse 14 says
[57:18] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[57:21] God they are the sons of God for you
[57:24] have not received the spirit of bondage
[57:26] again to fear but you have received the
[57:29] spirit of
[57:30] adoption whereby we cry AB a father the
[57:35] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[57:38] spirit that we are the children of God
[57:42] you know that's exactly what happens
[57:43] when you receive the Holy Ghost it is
[57:45] the spirit of adoption and it causes us
[57:49] to recognize who God is and at the same
[57:52] time we are recognized and placed as
[57:55] such
[57:57] look in verse 177 for it said if
[58:00] children then HS Hees of God and join HS
[58:03] with Christ so we're placed and and are
[58:06] given Airship with Christ through
[58:09] through the holy ghost that if we be
[58:12] that we suffer with him that we may also
[58:15] be
[58:16] glorified together for I reckon that the
[58:19] sufferings of this present time are not
[58:21] worthy to be compared with the glory
[58:24] which shall be revealed in US for the
[58:27] earnest expectation of the creature
[58:29] waiteth for the
[58:31] manifestations of the sons of God for
[58:34] the creature was made subject to vanity
[58:37] not willingly but by reason of him who
[58:40] had subjected the same as in Hope
[58:43] because the creature itself also shall
[58:45] be delivered from the bondage of
[58:47] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[58:50] the children of God for we know that the
[58:53] whole creation granth and travaileth in
[58:57] pain together until now and not only
[59:00] they but ourselves also which have the
[59:04] first fruits of the spirit even we
[59:07] ourselves grown within ourselves for
[59:11] that great final day waiting for the
[59:14] adoption that is the Redemption of our
[59:18] body amen God bless you you can be
[59:22] seated I'm going to be speaking on the
[59:25] adoption age this morning and there's a
[59:28] whole lot to this subject and maybe we
[59:30] won't even get to it all today but we
[59:34] will just kind of maybe introduce this
[59:37] subject as we go and and uh at the same
[59:40] time I want to recap with some of the
[59:42] things that we have been ministering on
[59:44] and I hope that you if you were not here
[59:47] that you've been keeping up because it's
[59:49] very vital and and important subjects
[59:51] that we're speaking about um of the
[59:54] events of this last days that we can
[59:56] know and make our calling and election
[59:59] sure but this is the day that all of
[1:00:01] Heaven and Earth has been waiting
[1:00:04] for the age of adoption words the sons
[1:00:07] of God are
[1:00:09] manifested as the Bible said that that
[1:00:11] the whole creation granth and travaileth
[1:00:15] in pain together and Paul would say even
[1:00:19] now so as we think of that I mean he
[1:00:23] could realize that there had been many
[1:00:25] wers several things that had been done
[1:00:27] in his age and his time already Christ
[1:00:29] had come the Redeemer he had paid
[1:00:33] Redemption price he was the lamb slain
[1:00:37] and it had been done in God's mind
[1:00:39] before the world began but now was
[1:00:41] manifested upon the Earth and not only
[1:00:44] that but the life of that lamb had come
[1:00:47] back on the day of Pentecost and men and
[1:00:50] women were filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:00:52] they were actually God breathed the word
[1:00:56] became flesh as the spirit of God was
[1:00:59] manifested in these people but he said
[1:01:02] even now even right now the whole
[1:01:05] creation Groth and travaileth in pain
[1:01:09] together and I I would say that as we
[1:01:12] stand here today 2,000 years later seven
[1:01:16] Church ages later and we uh we have had
[1:01:21] great things that has happened in our
[1:01:23] day it's been a time of restoration
[1:01:25] where the word has been restored and the
[1:01:28] mysteries of God revealed and seven
[1:01:31] Thunders that were hidden from the other
[1:01:33] ages have now been revealed to the
[1:01:36] church as was promised in the last day
[1:01:40] and that it would happen in the days of
[1:01:42] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:01:44] would sound his message so many great
[1:01:47] things seven angels coming from that
[1:01:50] Dimension representing the the
[1:01:53] completion of the church ages and that
[1:01:56] we are now um in the very finished time
[1:02:00] and and age and the messenger has
[1:02:03] already come and gone and here we are
[1:02:06] today yet even now that the whole
[1:02:09] creation granth and travail it together
[1:02:13] in pain as I look upon today men and
[1:02:16] women and and that are that are coming
[1:02:20] of age or getting older if I would say
[1:02:23] and you know we We Grown the we feel our
[1:02:26] creation groaning within
[1:02:29] ourselves and we are longing of course
[1:02:32] for the Redemption of our bodies because
[1:02:35] 2,000 years ago the promise was given
[1:02:39] for the Redemption of the soul and so
[1:02:42] that has been the main theme of The
[1:02:44] Gospel now for 2,000 years but now we
[1:02:48] are changing into a different cycle
[1:02:51] where that the theme becomes the
[1:02:53] Redemption of our body what the great
[1:02:57] Prophets The Messengers that have Herald
[1:03:00] down to the ages and have screamed out
[1:03:03] and and typed out and foreshadowed is
[1:03:06] about to come to pass where that we will
[1:03:09] go back into Eden and back into Mort
[1:03:13] into immortality from mortality and be
[1:03:17] changed in a moment and a twinkling of
[1:03:19] an eye so you see we are in a day where
[1:03:23] the message is of a rapture
[1:03:26] it is of a resurrection it is of
[1:03:30] completion and full restoration and full
[1:03:34] Redemption As we sing sometimes that's
[1:03:37] what seven angels in the cloud
[1:03:39] represented was full
[1:03:42] Redemption you see that we are here in
[1:03:44] the last day in the completion of the
[1:03:48] cycle uh of redemption and it's no
[1:03:51] longer the initiating of redemption but
[1:03:54] now the emphas
[1:03:56] begin to change as we look now from the
[1:04:00] part from the part of him doing his
[1:04:02] purchasing work um at Calvary to him now
[1:04:06] doing his redeeming work or moving from
[1:04:10] his intercessory work to his claiming
[1:04:12] work and here we are in this last day
[1:04:15] where he is claiming a people for his
[1:04:19] name's sake oh I'm so glad to know that
[1:04:22] I'm one of them that have been claimed
[1:04:25] as a the Bible said the spirit beareth
[1:04:27] witness with our spirit that we are sons
[1:04:31] of God that he has recognized us as his
[1:04:35] sons as his daughters in this last day
[1:04:38] I'd like for you to put up for me
[1:04:40] Revelation 10 and one because we have
[1:04:42] been speaking about how this is so
[1:04:46] revent to us in this life's age and just
[1:04:49] keep that up before us for a moment and
[1:04:51] display it so before us to remember how
[1:04:54] that where we are in this time and
[1:04:58] scriptures that are so revelent to us in
[1:05:02] this in this hour light has been shown
[1:05:06] on what was once Mysteries and and uh
[1:05:10] Shadows are Parables and now it's no
[1:05:13] longer parabolic but now it's becoming
[1:05:17] manifested words that were laying in the
[1:05:20] Bible now becoming God breathe and the
[1:05:23] spirit unctions them as it Goes Forth to
[1:05:26] manifest itself and find flesh to reveal
[1:05:30] itself in this is the day that we are in
[1:05:33] and he said and I saw another Mighty
[1:05:37] Angel hey and and this is important to
[1:05:40] see that angel is Angelos which means
[1:05:44] messenger so I saw another Mighty
[1:05:47] messenger oh no this is not a man this
[1:05:51] is this not a man this is the spirit of
[1:05:54] God coming down as his own messenger he
[1:05:57] comes down from heaven remember God has
[1:06:01] made a promise in this last day that the
[1:06:04] mighty one Christ himself would descend
[1:06:08] and he would descend from heaven and he
[1:06:10] would do it with a message with a shout
[1:06:14] and we can see that here in Revelation
[1:06:16] 10 verse one that the mighty Angel comes
[1:06:20] down and he he comes from Heaven he is
[1:06:24] clothed with Cloud as a messenger of his
[1:06:28] Covenant he comes and and I want you to
[1:06:31] consider this that that Jesus came 2,000
[1:06:36] years ago as a messenger and the
[1:06:39] mediator of the Covenant so why would it
[1:06:43] be that in the last days in Revelation
[1:06:46] 10 why would this be the spirit of Jesus
[1:06:49] coming again in this last day a
[1:06:52] spiritual forerunning of his physical
[1:06:55] coming so here he comes down with the
[1:06:58] open book The Covenant this can be none
[1:07:02] other than the spirit of Jesus as he
[1:07:05] alone is the mediator remember there is
[1:07:08] one only one mediator between God in man
[1:07:12] and that's the man Christ Jesus so if
[1:07:15] one is coming as a mediator then it has
[1:07:19] to be Christ it cannot be another man
[1:07:23] cannot be a bishop it cannot be a PO
[1:07:25] hope it Cann not be a prophet it cannot
[1:07:28] even be an angel in the sense of one
[1:07:31] with wings but it can be only God it can
[1:07:35] only be God as the messenger of his own
[1:07:39] Covenant amen the Holy Spirit coming
[1:07:42] down the spirit of Jesus
[1:07:45] descending Hallelujah to anoint a people
[1:07:48] in this last day are you with me amen he
[1:07:52] alone is the mediator the AR arbitrator
[1:07:56] the facilitator of the word of his
[1:07:59] Covenant so he comes down with his
[1:08:01] Covenant in his hand he comes down with
[1:08:05] his buck in his hand I want to ask you
[1:08:08] then how foolish is it of men today to
[1:08:11] declare that his mediatorial work is
[1:08:14] over amen how could his mediatorial work
[1:08:17] be over then amen because there had been
[1:08:20] a dispute in Revelation 5 there was a
[1:08:24] dispute in Heaven over is there a man
[1:08:28] worthy amen so the judge on the throne
[1:08:32] finding no man became a
[1:08:35] man amen in order to take the book for
[1:08:39] man I want you to know he had it as God
[1:08:42] he didn't need it as God Amen it was man
[1:08:46] that lost it he lost the title to
[1:08:49] immortality he lost the title to God
[1:08:53] life and eternal life am God didn't need
[1:08:58] that but the devil couldn't take it and
[1:09:01] Adam lost it and became subservient to
[1:09:04] him amen but Jesus came Hallelujah to
[1:09:08] win it
[1:09:09] back Hallelujah to win it back as a man
[1:09:14] for
[1:09:16] man isn't that
[1:09:18] marvelous how incredible is the story of
[1:09:21] redemption the very Act of him taking
[1:09:24] the book is a result of his as of his
[1:09:29] work as mediator and then his arbitrator
[1:09:32] who settled the dispute over the
[1:09:34] question title he by his Spirit comes
[1:09:39] comes down with the book to hand it back
[1:09:43] to
[1:09:47] man do you realize you're the people
[1:09:51] he's handing it
[1:09:53] to do you realize you are the people
[1:09:56] he's opened it
[1:09:58] for amen do you realize you are the
[1:10:01] beneficiary of his of the benefits of
[1:10:04] what he
[1:10:06] did so keep my scripture up now amen
[1:10:10] Revelation 10:1 I saw another Mighty
[1:10:13] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[1:10:16] a cloud why a cloud because it's a
[1:10:19] powerful manifestation of God's
[1:10:22] Authority and His Majesty amen amen he
[1:10:25] was always associated with the cloud and
[1:10:28] the fire and the cloud and the fire
[1:10:32] right right amen and a rainbow was on
[1:10:35] his
[1:10:36] head oh my a rainbow over his head or up
[1:10:41] on his head here he was in the fullness
[1:10:44] of seven
[1:10:46] colors representing the entire complete
[1:10:52] Covenant amen hallelujah amen this is
[1:10:56] the Covenant Angel only Christ can be
[1:10:59] and his feet where he touches the Earth
[1:11:02] is his body the
[1:11:06] church amen as pillars of
[1:11:10] fire for the fire divided itself into
[1:11:13] portions on the day of
[1:11:16] Pentecost and friends that's where he's
[1:11:18] walking on the earth that's where he's
[1:11:21] putting his feet that's where he is
[1:11:23] overcoming today that is where he's
[1:11:26] putting his foot upon the head of the
[1:11:28] serpent and his bruising the head of the
[1:11:30] serpent that troubled your life and your
[1:11:33] life and your life and that habit and
[1:11:35] that complex and that sin and that
[1:11:39] sickness come on church amen think about
[1:11:42] it here he comes there with his feet as
[1:11:45] are as pillars of fire and I look out
[1:11:48] here today and I see pillars of fire all
[1:11:51] over this building men and women who
[1:11:54] have been l with the fire of
[1:11:57] [Applause]
[1:11:59] God whose feet possess the gates of
[1:12:03] their
[1:12:05] enemies and he had in his hand a little
[1:12:09] book
[1:12:11] opened no longer
[1:12:13] sealed no longer
[1:12:16] closed no longer question
[1:12:20] title Hallelujah no longer held
[1:12:24] back but every promise open up to
[1:12:27] you the age of adoption a people coming
[1:12:31] into full
[1:12:33] inheritance amen didn't we read that to
[1:12:36] you a while ago didn't we read there
[1:12:38] that that he that we have been we have
[1:12:40] received as HS as of God and HS and join
[1:12:45] HS with Christ you see here he comes he
[1:12:49] has
[1:12:50] it but he ain't satisfied just to have
[1:12:54] that he wants you to be a joy there with
[1:12:58] [Applause]
[1:12:59] him Hallelujah he wants you to enjoy the
[1:13:03] benefits I tell you we are a people
[1:13:05] today enjoying the benefits of what he
[1:13:09] did in Calvary but not only of what he
[1:13:12] done at Calvary but what he's done in
[1:13:13] our
[1:13:14] day amen now this is the day that heaven
[1:13:20] has been waiting for and and this is an
[1:13:22] hour where that he's finishing up
[1:13:25] Redemption so the next verse says and he
[1:13:27] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[1:13:33] Roth why would it speak like that
[1:13:36] because twofold when you see when God
[1:13:40] speaks it is as the king
[1:13:44] speaking amen even in ancient times the
[1:13:46] lion represented the king and and here
[1:13:49] he he is the final voice he is the
[1:13:52] supreme authority he is the one wigged
[1:13:55] in light and when he shows himself in
[1:13:58] the heaven with seven angels and a cloud
[1:14:00] picture was taken it was all wigged in
[1:14:03] white showing what the Supreme
[1:14:10] judge
[1:14:12] hallelujah amen what a day we're living
[1:14:16] in what an hour when brother Brandon
[1:14:19] would take an even look at that cloud
[1:14:21] and he said look he's looking over to
[1:14:24] the right
[1:14:25] I wish I had a picture of it right now
[1:14:27] he's looking over to the right where he
[1:14:30] pardoned The
[1:14:32] Sinner where he gave
[1:14:35] Mercy this is how he's looking I mean
[1:14:38] people want to say Mercy is over we are
[1:14:40] the greatest display of Mercy that
[1:14:43] there's ever
[1:14:44] been Hallelujah the very message God
[1:14:48] said in this day is a message of
[1:14:52] Mercy it's Grace coming to a church
[1:14:55] church it's the Capstone coming with
[1:14:57] double Grace favor upon
[1:15:01] favor it's God coming to a virgin an
[1:15:04] angel coming to the Virgin and saying
[1:15:06] hail Mary highly
[1:15:13] favored and when he cried during his
[1:15:16] shout seven Thunders uttered your
[1:15:21] voices now we know the story
[1:15:26] John was going to tell us what he
[1:15:28] said but God held the meaning
[1:15:32] back let's look at verse
[1:15:36] seven and I want you to understand in
[1:15:39] verse S when he says after he's saying
[1:15:42] seal it up don't write
[1:15:46] it that he swears by him that liveth
[1:15:49] forever and ever but in the days of The
[1:15:53] Voice
[1:15:55] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[1:15:57] to sound the mystery of God should be
[1:16:01] finished as he had declared to his
[1:16:04] servants the
[1:16:06] prophets so God God promised that it
[1:16:11] wouldn't always remain
[1:16:13] silent amen but all the secret of his
[1:16:17] coming would be revealed in the last day
[1:16:19] through a prophetic
[1:16:22] message think about that
[1:16:25] verse 10 says and I looked I took the
[1:16:28] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[1:16:31] I ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[1:16:34] as honey and as soon as I'd eaten it my
[1:16:38] belly was
[1:16:42] bitter and we sat down and made another
[1:16:44] organization just became another
[1:16:46] denomination and perpetuated the
[1:16:52] ages so what it is yeah as soon as I'd
[1:16:56] eaten my belly was bitter and he said
[1:16:59] unto me thou must prophesy sir now you
[1:17:05] must give
[1:17:07] voice to what you have
[1:17:10] eaten it's got to be displayed in your
[1:17:13] life if I said these Sons shall follow
[1:17:16] them that believe you're going to be the
[1:17:18] voice of that scripture if I said
[1:17:21] baptize in Jesus name the name of the
[1:17:23] Lord Jesus Christ you're be the voice of
[1:17:25] that scripture if I said Holiness you're
[1:17:29] going to be the voice of that
[1:17:32] scripture whatever I said you're going
[1:17:35] to eat it and give
[1:17:38] voice now Paul disclosed that Christ
[1:17:43] does three things as he descends so
[1:17:46] we'll look at 1 Thessalonians
[1:17:48] 4:16 so there are three phases to his
[1:17:51] coming which can be see here in in first
[1:17:55] Thessalonians
[1:17:56] 4:16 and for the Lord himself shall
[1:17:59] descend from heaven with a shout with
[1:18:03] the voice of the Archangel with the
[1:18:05] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:18:07] shall rise first so three things he does
[1:18:11] as he descends first it is a shout
[1:18:15] that's first pH that is a prophet
[1:18:17] bringing a
[1:18:19] message remember we hear the Thunder's
[1:18:23] voice what God God had held up of his
[1:18:27] word until a prophet comes now the shout
[1:18:31] comes and it comes to bring the people
[1:18:35] of God back to the homeland of the word
[1:18:39] and then with the voice of the Archangel
[1:18:42] and with the Trump of God and the dead
[1:18:44] in Christ shall rise first then we which
[1:18:46] are alive and remain should be caught up
[1:18:48] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:18:51] the Lord in the air and so shall we ever
[1:18:53] be with the Lord amen
[1:18:55] so hold before them right now verse
[1:18:58] 16 and let's just examine
[1:19:02] this we know what the shout
[1:19:05] is but it says with the voice of the
[1:19:10] Archangel now Archangel I'm going to go
[1:19:12] over this for a moment because Archangel
[1:19:15] means chief of the
[1:19:19] Angels ruler of the
[1:19:21] angels and it is mentioned in Jude
[1:19:25] 1:9 of Michael being named as an
[1:19:29] archangel so let's look at that
[1:19:31] scripture Jude
[1:19:33] 1:9 Yet Michael the Archangel when
[1:19:36] contended with the devil he disputed
[1:19:38] about the body of Moses Dar not bring
[1:19:41] against him a raen accusation but said
[1:19:44] the Lord rebuke you because it was not
[1:19:47] time to bring judgment to the devil
[1:19:49] that's
[1:19:51] right are you with me so what did he do
[1:19:55] he he Dar not bring a ra and accusation
[1:19:58] against him he couldn't condemn him to
[1:19:59] hell he couldn't even bind him for a
[1:20:02] thousand
[1:20:05] years because he still is permitted by
[1:20:10] God Amen because he is a tool in God's
[1:20:14] hand remember that the devil is only a
[1:20:18] tool in the hand of God and God lets him
[1:20:23] work in order to bring about Redemption
[1:20:26] and the power of
[1:20:28] redemption yeah when he created him he
[1:20:30] knew what he would become but he didn't
[1:20:33] make him come become that he didn't make
[1:20:36] him a devil he made him an angel
[1:20:39] beautiful full of wisdom all of that
[1:20:41] until he become exalted in himself then
[1:20:44] he
[1:20:46] fell now I want you to notice but the
[1:20:49] Bible said that Michael is seen here now
[1:20:53] here he's named Michael and the name
[1:20:55] Michael is who is like Jehovah or who is
[1:20:59] like
[1:21:01] El who is like
[1:21:05] Yahweh the one who is like Yahweh amen
[1:21:10] because why he is the Angelic
[1:21:13] theic
[1:21:15] manifestation of Jesus
[1:21:19] himself now as we look at this Michael
[1:21:22] was was seen disp in with Satan over the
[1:21:27] body of
[1:21:29] Moses and I want to ask you who else but
[1:21:32] Christ disputes over men's body that's
[1:21:35] right come on amen he listen
[1:21:41] Christ will dispute with Satan over your
[1:21:46] body oh yes he does amen he disputed
[1:21:50] with with with Satan over men and women
[1:21:53] and boys and girls body and would cast
[1:21:56] Satan
[1:21:59] out didn't he not amen he disputed with
[1:22:04] Satan over the widest son of name he
[1:22:07] disputed with death over the body of
[1:22:10] Lazarus amen death Decay and everything
[1:22:13] else had to give way when he
[1:22:18] disputed amen he desp spirited with the
[1:22:21] devil overtaking Lazarus
[1:22:25] and said Lazarus come
[1:22:28] forth and by his word restored him back
[1:22:32] to life
[1:22:34] again we're talking about the work of
[1:22:36] the mediator we're talking about the
[1:22:39] arbitrator at
[1:22:40] work we're talking about the
[1:22:44] Redeemer amen who can contend with the
[1:22:47] devil over
[1:22:50] bodies Hallelujah I remember the day he
[1:22:53] contended with the devil over my body I
[1:22:56] was lost and out in sin I was a sinner
[1:22:59] and on my way to hell but she contended
[1:23:02] with the devil over my body so that my
[1:23:05] body could be the Temple of the Holy
[1:23:08] Ghost he said Satan that ain't your body
[1:23:12] that's my
[1:23:13] [Applause]
[1:23:16] body that's a
[1:23:18] body I have prepared for
[1:23:21] me you have possessed it you you have
[1:23:24] rued it you have wrecked it with every
[1:23:27] kind of sin but I come to claim it what
[1:23:31] is
[1:23:36] mine and I just want to say to you the
[1:23:40] final rebuke will come to
[1:23:42] Satan when death is rebuked and the
[1:23:45] contest is fully won and the dead in
[1:23:48] Christ
[1:23:51] rise as I said Michael means who who is
[1:23:54] like God one who is like God he's shown
[1:23:59] in the Book of Daniel as the
[1:24:02] intercessor let's go to Daniel 12 and
[1:24:05] verse one at that time shall Michael
[1:24:08] stand
[1:24:10] up why has he been sitting
[1:24:16] down Christ has been interceding for
[1:24:19] 2,000
[1:24:21] years come on Amen but he is rising in
[1:24:25] this day to finish up
[1:24:28] Redemption amen and he shall stand up
[1:24:31] the great Prince which standeth for the
[1:24:33] children of thy people oh thank God for
[1:24:36] an intercessor there shall come a time
[1:24:38] of trouble such as never since there was
[1:24:41] a nation even to that same time and at
[1:24:43] that same time thy people shall be
[1:24:46] delivered everyone that shall be found
[1:24:49] written in the book
[1:24:54] so who's all going to be who is all
[1:24:58] going to be delivered everyone whose
[1:25:00] name's in the
[1:25:01] book is that right God knows exactly who
[1:25:04] they are he knows how to get them some
[1:25:08] it takes a long time but he gets them
[1:25:11] sometimes the battle is long and hard
[1:25:13] but he gets them he's going to win
[1:25:16] that's right he's been contested with
[1:25:18] the devil ever since Eden but he's going
[1:25:21] to finish the battle
[1:25:28] now you might question me on that well
[1:25:30] this is from beginning ending a Gentiles
[1:25:33] dispensation and at that time Michael
[1:25:36] shall stand the great
[1:25:38] Prince Michael was Christ of course who
[1:25:43] he was Christ of
[1:25:45] course who fought the Angelic Wars in
[1:25:48] heaven with the devil amen San and
[1:25:51] Michael fought against each other
[1:25:56] well brother Tim that was back in 55
[1:25:58] well after the seals in Christ the
[1:26:01] mystery no notice Lucifer in the last
[1:26:04] day is doing as he did at first what did
[1:26:07] Lucifer do the first thing that Lucifer
[1:26:09] done to separate the fellowship of God
[1:26:13] and man he wanted to build him a United
[1:26:16] Kingdom a greater Splendor and seemly
[1:26:18] more cultured a greater Kingdom than
[1:26:21] Michael Christ had
[1:26:25] Lucifer at the beginning his purpose in
[1:26:28] heart was to achieve a brighter and
[1:26:30] greater thing in heaven that Christ had
[1:26:33] is that right by seemingly a more
[1:26:35] cultured more beautiful more Splendor
[1:26:38] than the kingdom of Christ do you think
[1:26:41] we have automobiles in the Millennium
[1:26:43] and airplane see see what Lucifer is
[1:26:45] doing you wonder what's that got to do
[1:26:47] with it because he's creating himself an
[1:26:50] Eden
[1:26:52] amen trying to build that more cultured
[1:26:55] more beautiful more
[1:26:57] Splendor we we'll just we'll just make
[1:27:00] man have eternal life here we're going
[1:27:01] to figure out something that unlock the
[1:27:04] key to
[1:27:05] aging only god holds that
[1:27:09] key amen yes but oh we we'll fly to Mars
[1:27:14] we'll pollute that too amen you think
[1:27:17] we'll have automobiles in the Millennium
[1:27:19] no we won't need them we'll travel like
[1:27:21] a
[1:27:22] thought in fact to the matter is heaven
[1:27:25] will not be that far
[1:27:29] away now and he says many of them verse
[1:27:33] two which of of them that sleep in the
[1:27:36] dust listen when he stands up many of
[1:27:39] them that sleep in the dust shall awake
[1:27:42] some to everlasting life some to shame
[1:27:44] in Everlasting Temp and they that be
[1:27:47] well eyes that will shine as the
[1:27:51] brightness of the Firmin and they that
[1:27:53] turn many to right rightousness has the
[1:27:55] Stars forever and
[1:28:01] ever when did you ever see in your
[1:28:04] lifetime a star go
[1:28:07] out when did you ever see Mars or
[1:28:11] Jupiter or any of them quit
[1:28:15] shining come
[1:28:17] on they were shining when you were born
[1:28:19] they' be shining after you're gone let
[1:28:22] me tell you something friends when all
[1:28:24] the Earth and everything of this
[1:28:27] civilization is gone we'll be shining in
[1:28:29] the heavens with God forever eternally
[1:28:33] with
[1:28:36] him now not only that but we see Michael
[1:28:40] doing the work of intercession disputing
[1:28:43] with Satan I'm just showing you Bible
[1:28:46] Revelation 12:7 now you know the brother
[1:28:49] Bram in the third and fourth seal tells
[1:28:51] us that when Satan is cast down the
[1:28:54] bride goes up so he places the Rapture
[1:28:57] right here in Revelation 12 now we know
[1:29:00] that it happens at the end of the leodan
[1:29:02] age and is depicted in Revelation CH 4
[1:29:06] but after Revelation 4 between 4 and 19
[1:29:09] or different all different kinds of
[1:29:11] scenes and they're not necessarily in
[1:29:14] chronological order that's right so they
[1:29:16] will go from a scene from the the seals
[1:29:20] to the vials the or Trumpets the vials
[1:29:23] it will go from scenes of of of a woman
[1:29:26] um on a moon and and um the the the sun
[1:29:31] is
[1:29:32] as is at her head and and the 12 stars
[1:29:36] that are around her and all these things
[1:29:38] show different kinds of things we'll
[1:29:40] move from that scene and we'll move to
[1:29:42] then to Revelation 13 of beasts rising
[1:29:46] up out of the land and the Sea and then
[1:29:48] we go into Revelation 15 and 16 and 17
[1:29:51] and show Christ's redeem and work with a
[1:29:54] with 144,000 and then it will show the
[1:29:57] Judgment of the great and and and
[1:30:00] place her all these things all these
[1:30:02] different
[1:30:04] scenes now brother brandham said
[1:30:07] anything between Revelation 4 and
[1:30:09] 19 that it has to happen back over here
[1:30:12] in the seven Church ages if it if it
[1:30:16] pertains to the
[1:30:20] Gentiles so now again if we're looking
[1:30:24] at this we see this scene and we could
[1:30:28] go through it it's a beautiful study of
[1:30:31] Revelation CH 12 that I don't have time
[1:30:35] to go through this morning because I can
[1:30:36] start with verse one and show you the
[1:30:39] symbology all the way down cuz as I said
[1:30:42] it's a beautiful story but for the sake
[1:30:44] of this sermon we want to see verse S
[1:30:47] and there was
[1:30:50] war in heaven
[1:30:54] now before there is
[1:30:58] Armageddon before there is a battle on
[1:31:01] the
[1:31:03] earth there is going to be a battle in
[1:31:05] the
[1:31:06] heavens and I want to just tell you it's
[1:31:09] taking place right
[1:31:11] now there is war going in the
[1:31:14] heavens amen as two opposing Spirits are
[1:31:18] facing each other say well how in the
[1:31:20] world does the dragon get in the heavens
[1:31:24] when he was cast
[1:31:27] out well that's a very good question
[1:31:30] because originally he was cast out and
[1:31:33] he came down to the Earth looking for a
[1:31:35] way back that's
[1:31:37] right and what did he do he found a
[1:31:40] weakness in
[1:31:42] Eve and he got Eve to submit to him and
[1:31:47] she in
[1:31:50] turn said look here Adam look what I've
[1:31:52] done and he took her quickly to
[1:31:55] himself amen but in doing so he became
[1:31:59] subservient to Satan and sold his place
[1:32:02] that he operated by the word in
[1:32:08] heaven so then every time that sons of
[1:32:13] God will go to appear before
[1:32:16] God Satan is there to oppose them so job
[1:32:21] goes to appear before God and Satan's
[1:32:23] right there to
[1:32:26] accuse is that right to accuse job
[1:32:30] before the Lord he is accuser of the
[1:32:32] brethren we see in Zachariah we won't
[1:32:35] have time to go to that scripture but
[1:32:37] you see in Zechariah Joshua the high
[1:32:39] priest and he as he stands before the
[1:32:42] Lord what happens Satan is at his right
[1:32:44] hand to oppose him so you see every time
[1:32:49] sons of God would appear in the heaven
[1:32:51] Satan is there to oppose him
[1:32:54] and say they have no right to be there
[1:33:00] this is why Paul says in Ephesians 6 we
[1:33:03] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:33:06] against principalities and powers and
[1:33:08] spiritual wickedness and Heavenly places
[1:33:11] you say brother says high places listen
[1:33:14] it's the same Greek word that is
[1:33:16] translated that he has made us to sit in
[1:33:19] Heavenly
[1:33:21] places Paul's using the same word King
[1:33:23] will change it from Heavenly to high
[1:33:26] it's all the same word our battle is in
[1:33:29] Heavenly places that's why it's hard to
[1:33:32] pray on because as you begin to take
[1:33:36] your position of sunship the devil is
[1:33:39] there to oppose
[1:33:40] you he is there to distract you he is
[1:33:44] there to accuse you and if he can
[1:33:46] convince you of something that is under
[1:33:49] the
[1:33:51] blood and that will hinder your Faith he
[1:33:54] will do anything he can to bring up
[1:33:58] anything to accuse you to keep you from
[1:34:01] taking your lawful rightful inheritance
[1:34:04] as a son or daughter of
[1:34:08] Goden
[1:34:12] awesome he is called the prince of the
[1:34:16] power of the
[1:34:18] air
[1:34:22] atmosphere amen but he's going to be so
[1:34:25] driven out of the
[1:34:27] atmosphere until that's where we're
[1:34:29] going to meet Jesus is in the
[1:34:38] air I hope you're catching
[1:34:41] something there was war in
[1:34:45] heaven and his
[1:34:48] angels Michael and his angels fought
[1:34:51] against the dragon remember
[1:34:55] remember in Daniel when a prayer was
[1:34:57] being made by Daniel and here three
[1:35:02] weeks later here comes the angel Gabriel
[1:35:05] and he said I would have come earlier I
[1:35:08] arrived here sooner but there was a war
[1:35:10] in
[1:35:17] heaven and if it hadn't been for Michael
[1:35:20] coming to help me I would not have
[1:35:22] prevailed
[1:35:25] I'm glad there's an
[1:35:27] intercessor I'm glad there's someone
[1:35:30] that comes on our
[1:35:32] behalf so that our prayers can get
[1:35:34] through and our answers can come
[1:35:39] back
[1:35:41] Hallelujah so you look at that for a
[1:35:43] moment and and you realize you know war
[1:35:46] was in the heavens and and they you know
[1:35:48] holding by the
[1:35:51] blessings I'll tell you what you may
[1:35:54] wonder what in the world how in the
[1:35:55] world what what did Satan do you know
[1:35:58] Satan stirs up strife and trouble and
[1:36:01] everything else Daniel was the third
[1:36:03] leader in the Kingdom he had duties of
[1:36:06] the priest of of of a prince I mean and
[1:36:10] he he had
[1:36:12] responsibilities before the king that he
[1:36:14] had to fulfill you can imagine as he got
[1:36:17] down to pray Satan stir something
[1:36:20] up and here somebody comes in and reps
[1:36:23] his
[1:36:25] prayer here the king wants this done El
[1:36:30] prompto you know the king wants this
[1:36:33] done this is hey there's a war broke out
[1:36:36] here you got to you got to administer do
[1:36:39] we have finances for so many troops to
[1:36:43] go you see there's every kind of
[1:36:45] opposing thing that's why brother
[1:36:48] Brandon said when you get down to pray
[1:36:50] he said the washing let don't don't let
[1:36:52] the washing hinder you
[1:36:54] you know everything you know the
[1:36:56] children everything else get in there
[1:36:58] and lock in until you get in the
[1:37:00] presence of
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:02] God oh yeah I'm guilty as you are
[1:37:06] sometimes just praying those prayers and
[1:37:08] God bless so and so and Lord help so and
[1:37:10] so but
[1:37:11] oh I get so convicted sometimes of
[1:37:15] saying
[1:37:17] God we need to get in that
[1:37:20] atmosphere where the Holy Ghost speaks
[1:37:23] back
[1:37:24] where the spirit of God comes down and
[1:37:27] intercedes amen and moves through us and
[1:37:30] speaks things that we couldn't even
[1:37:33] utter in a language we couldn't even
[1:37:35] utter and you will you will come and
[1:37:38] speak through us the things that needs
[1:37:41] to be
[1:37:42] said as we work as your servants here
[1:37:45] upon the
[1:37:48] Earth but I want you to notice that
[1:37:50] there was this war in
[1:37:54] heaven and Michael and his angels fought
[1:37:58] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[1:38:01] and his
[1:38:03] angels but I want you to look at the
[1:38:05] next verse because this is lays the hope
[1:38:09] of every
[1:38:10] believer and prevailed
[1:38:15] not amen when we read the end of the
[1:38:19] book your adversary ain't going to win
[1:38:24] there is a war going on in
[1:38:27] heaven but he prevails
[1:38:31] not Hallelujah and neither was their
[1:38:35] place that didn't belong to them
[1:38:37] originally but he took from Adam in the
[1:38:40] beginning that the book gives you title
[1:38:43] to and write to that place of dominion
[1:38:46] and power as an adopted
[1:38:49] son and Prevail not in their place
[1:38:56] right was not found anymore in
[1:39:04] heaven I wonder who then is sitting on
[1:39:08] that
[1:39:11] Throne I'll tell you he has made you to
[1:39:15] sit with him in Heavenly
[1:39:20] places positioned with an authority as
[1:39:23] an adopted
[1:39:26] son that's what adoption will mean is
[1:39:31] placed we'll get to it as we go
[1:39:34] along now I'm laboring on some of this
[1:39:37] for a reason and maybe we can catch up
[1:39:40] some of the rest of it but look at the
[1:39:41] next
[1:39:43] verse and the Great Dragon was cast
[1:39:47] out oh listen this is where brother Bram
[1:39:50] says this old serpent called the devil
[1:39:53] and Satan that deceiveth the whole world
[1:39:55] all the way back from Eden he was cast
[1:39:58] out into the Earth and his angels were
[1:40:00] cast out with
[1:40:02] him Hallelujah now do you realize when
[1:40:06] Satan is cast down the bride goes
[1:40:10] up amen do you see in Revelation 9 And1
[1:40:14] that put that scripture up Revelation 9
[1:40:16] And1 he is a fallen
[1:40:21] star but do you understand you are not a
[1:40:24] people that are falling you are people
[1:40:25] that are
[1:40:27] rising ascending it's Rapture
[1:40:32] hour the very Act of your conversion was
[1:40:35] a in rapturing
[1:40:38] up it was an astion bringing you up from
[1:40:42] the pits of sin and bringing you into
[1:40:46] and elevating you into
[1:40:50] sunship now so you
[1:40:54] see key was given to the bottom of pit I
[1:40:57] saw a star fall from Heaven notice this
[1:41:00] and he opened up the bottomless pit so
[1:41:02] he has the authority then to bring hell
[1:41:04] on the earth and here he comes Satan and
[1:41:07] his angels with
[1:41:09] him notice now verse 10 and now we turn
[1:41:14] from that
[1:41:16] view of verse 10 now Revelation 12 and10
[1:41:20] let toggled back there and I heard a
[1:41:24] loud voice saying in heaven re
[1:41:28] Revelation 12:10 a loud voice saying in
[1:41:32] heaven now is come salvation and
[1:41:36] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[1:41:39] the power of His Christ for the accuser
[1:41:43] of our Brethren is cast down which accus
[1:41:47] them before our God day and
[1:41:50] night hallu somebody water

[1:42:10] heaven look the very casting down of
[1:42:13] Satan brings Ascension the Rapture of
[1:42:17] the bride and now she is shown in heaven
[1:42:20] saying with a loud voice now now is come
[1:42:24] salvation wait wait wait wait wait wait
[1:42:26] wait now has come salvation I mean my
[1:42:29] goodness we really now salvation I
[1:42:32] thought we got salvation back at Calvary
[1:42:34] no not full
[1:42:38] salvation because the Redemption of our
[1:42:41] body has been
[1:42:44] withheld until the age of adoption
[1:42:47] that's
[1:42:48] right and I heard a loud voice saying in
[1:42:51] heaven now is coming
[1:42:54] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[1:42:57] of our God and the power of His Christ
[1:43:01] for the accuser of our Brethren is cast
[1:43:05] down which accuse them before our God
[1:43:08] day and
[1:43:20] night verse 11
[1:43:23] and if you're wondering if all this was
[1:43:27] Angelic
[1:43:30] battles I want you to examine the
[1:43:33] scripture real
[1:43:34] close and they overcame him by the blood
[1:43:39] of the Lamb stop this one moment never
[1:43:42] was one drop of blood ever shed for an
[1:43:44] Angel that's right Angels do not have
[1:43:47] access to the blood the blood was shed
[1:43:50] for you and me
[1:43:53] amen and they overcame him by the blood
[1:43:56] of the lamb and by the word of their
[1:43:59] testimony and they love not their lives
[1:44:01] into the
[1:44:03] death Hallelujah so you can see now
[1:44:06] Angelic battles become human
[1:44:09] battles here we are now on the earth and
[1:44:12] it is being fought in heaven fought on
[1:44:14] Earth all at the same time and
[1:44:17] conjunction and you're fighting for your
[1:44:19] position and Authority as a son or
[1:44:21] daughter of God to have to dominion over
[1:44:24] sickness over death over the tomb over
[1:44:26] the restraints of the Tomb over Creeds
[1:44:28] of man come on church amen and they
[1:44:32] overcame him Hallelujah by Blood what

[1:44:47] know Jesus blood can make the violence
[1:44:51] sinner clean how clean brother Tim you
[1:44:54] never did it in the first
[1:44:59] place totally gone never
[1:45:02] attributed to your predestinated
[1:45:05] seed it's what Satan did when he was
[1:45:08] using your
[1:45:10] body it's not what that seed ever did
[1:45:14] but now that the seed has been
[1:45:15] germinated and come to life no more do I
[1:45:18] do the Deeds of Satan these hands that
[1:45:21] used to serve the devil only serve God
[1:45:23] this mouth that used to serve the devil
[1:45:25] only serves God somebody help me preach
[1:45:28] Hallelujah when you realize you overcome
[1:45:31] by the blood of the
[1:45:33] [Applause]

[1:45:42] of
[1:45:47] you therefore Rejoice your
[1:45:50] heavens and ye that dwell in the
[1:45:54] but woe to the inhabiters of the earth
[1:45:57] and of the sea for the devil has come
[1:45:59] down to you having great wrath because
[1:46:01] he knoweth he has but three and a half
[1:46:07] years we're right here on the cusp for
[1:46:10] that soon as a bride leaves it's all
[1:46:13] hell breaks loose with Satan coming down
[1:46:17] we don't know if we got Satan Superman
[1:46:19] in our
[1:46:21] government amen we don't know but we
[1:46:24] know he's Rising that's right come on
[1:46:26] church amen so these manifest these
[1:46:30] manifested sons in the last day operate
[1:46:34] under the anointing of the mighty angel
[1:46:37] I want you to just keep up Revelation
[1:46:38] 10:1 now these manifested sons in the
[1:46:43] last days operate under the annointing
[1:46:47] of this Mighty
[1:46:50] angel now let me just show you the
[1:46:53] scripture let's go back and see a a type
[1:46:57] in the scripture let's go see the POS or
[1:47:01] or shall I say the negative because we
[1:47:03] are the positive to the
[1:47:05] scripture and we look back to the first
[1:47:09] Exodus and we see a man by the name of
[1:47:13] Moses and Moses tried to deliver God's
[1:47:17] people by his intellectual understanding
[1:47:20] he killed one Egyptian but he didn't
[1:47:23] deliver
[1:47:25] Israel now it is true with your
[1:47:28] intellectual knowledge you can go to AA
[1:47:31] and use men's knowledge and quit
[1:47:33] drinking the desire still
[1:47:37] there but you can you can become a
[1:47:40] reformed
[1:47:42] person you can kill one Egyptian but
[1:47:45] it's not
[1:47:47] Deliverance the church can have programs
[1:47:50] of psychology yeah
[1:47:53] and with their philosophy train people
[1:47:57] to be good to their wife be a good
[1:48:00] father be a good parent a good
[1:48:05] mother and treat the symptoms of
[1:48:08] sin but there's only one sin cure and
[1:48:13] that's the blood of Jesus
[1:48:15] Christ it is the Divine vaccine that
[1:48:18] inoculates you from
[1:48:19] sin now if we look at this for a moment
[1:48:22] Moses remember tried to deliver God's
[1:48:24] people by intellectual understanding he
[1:48:27] believed the
[1:48:30] message cuz his mother mother and daddy
[1:48:33] taught
[1:48:35] him that represents ever young people
[1:48:38] rasted up in the message that's right
[1:48:41] you know what's right what's wrong you
[1:48:43] know you are to be a deliverer you know
[1:48:45] that you are to be a serpent Bruiser you
[1:48:47] know you know you know you know you know
[1:48:50] you're taught you're trained and
[1:48:53] everything but all that training can do
[1:48:55] is just kill an Egyptian just one never
[1:48:59] deliver the
[1:49:01] people never remain you know still
[1:49:04] remaining under
[1:49:07] bondage get you to reform be a better
[1:49:11] boy be a better girl like I said maybe
[1:49:13] be a good husband come to church be a
[1:49:16] tith payer but still a denominational
[1:49:18] church
[1:49:20] member exactly
[1:49:22] but I want you to understand once
[1:49:26] positioned and placed in the presence of
[1:49:29] The Burning Bush Moses returns to Egypt
[1:49:33] with more than an intellectual
[1:49:36] conception but with the power of the
[1:49:38] mighty
[1:49:39] Angel hallelujah amen God who had came
[1:49:43] down to deliver Egypt from Israel from
[1:49:47] Egypt's
[1:49:49] bondage now under the power of that
[1:49:51] Mighty Angel oh oh my goodness I want
[1:49:54] you to look the difference between him
[1:49:56] and that intellectual anointing amen and
[1:49:59] I understand you know we we
[1:50:01] intellectually have believed the message
[1:50:04] and we have preached it and we got the
[1:50:06] mechanics all
[1:50:08] down but One Moment In The Presence of
[1:50:12] the
[1:50:13] Dynamics that Pillar of Fire Moses
[1:50:17] leaves from there under the influence of
[1:50:20] a mighty angel
[1:50:24] Hallelujah somebody with me amen I hope
[1:50:27] you're following this I hope it's
[1:50:29] sitting down on the inside of your soul

[1:50:34] mighty
[1:50:36] Angel God himself who had come down to
[1:50:40] deliver Israel yes sir what did he say

[1:50:45] Cry of my

[1:50:51] taskmasters I've seen them with their
[1:50:54] three cornered clubs you'll know if you

[1:51:02] man with a three Corner Club supposed to
[1:51:04] be my father beating someone who was
[1:51:06] supposed to be my mother with a three

[1:51:52] do anything but I want you to understand
[1:51:55] you see God did something in our day

[1:52:02] conception or another intellectual just
[1:52:04] a a new understanding and new doctrines
[1:52:07] to the
[1:52:09] church but God sent the Dynamics of the

[1:59:53] this same Mighty Angel seen in Acts 2
[1:59:56] and what do we see in Acts 2 much like
[1:59:59] those in the verse Exodus
[2:00:03] scared you know afraid doubting
[2:00:10] confused oh Moses Moses back off a

[2:00:26] delivered us you just made the devil
[2:00:29] mad well I tell you when you see the
[2:00:32] devil get mad you know the hour of

[2:00:38] hand I've seen it too often I'll see the
[2:00:41] devil raiseed up I'll see him act out
[2:00:44] and manifest and when I see him begin to
[2:00:46] speak out of people's mouth and Wither
[2:00:48] in their bodies I know he's about to be
[2:00:51] cast out something has happened he's
[2:00:53] become afraid he's become afraid enough
[2:00:56] to identify
[2:01:02] himself
[2:01:04] yes bunch of scared afraid doubting
[2:01:09] confused people a man who had denied the
[2:01:13] Lord and said I go a
[2:01:16] fishing and he' have went back to his
[2:01:19] old lifestyle if Jesus hadn't come in
[2:01:22] got
[2:01:25] him but you see this before his
[2:01:28] conversion this before he got the Holy
[2:01:30] Ghost are you with me now let me tell
[2:01:33] you the same the same now you know you
[2:01:36] know this will happen to you you you'll
[2:01:38] be you'll be a a lying cussing
[2:01:43] believer I Believe In Christ die to
[2:01:46] Christ the son of the Living God all
[2:01:48] right I believe I'm a Believer and
[2:01:51] you'll be a lying cussing Peter until
[2:01:54] you get your
[2:01:56] Pentecost and when you get your
[2:01:58] Pentecost that same guy who's fearful
[2:02:01] and Afraid amen becomes a spokesman in
[2:02:04] the upper room with the key to unlock it
[2:02:06] for all the rest of us repent every one
[2:02:09] of you and be baptized in the name of
[2:02:11] Jesus Christ by remission of sin and you
[2:02:14] shall receive the Keys of the Kingdom
[2:02:17] the gift of the Holy
[2:02:19] Ghost cuz this promise is going to be
[2:02:21] for years
[2:02:22] your children and those that are far off
[2:02:25] even seven Church ages
[2:02:28] later even as many as the Lord Our God
[2:02:31] shall call and as long as he's still
[2:02:33] calling Mercy still
[2:02:37] Reigns and when the last one comes in
[2:02:40] the bride goes
[2:02:45] up so this same Mighty Angel is seen
[2:02:48] coming down in Acts chapter
[2:02:50] 2 as men who was scared afraid doubting
[2:02:56] confused but when the mighty Angel
[2:02:59] descended in a rushing Mighty Wind right
[2:03:02] out in the streets they went talking the
[2:03:06] Angel's
[2:03:08] language Hallelujah can you imagine that
[2:03:11] they went out talking the same language
[2:03:14] of the
[2:03:15] Angel come on it's time we quit talking
[2:03:17] doubts and fears and unbelief come under
[2:03:20] the power of the mighty Angel and start
[2:03:23] saying the same thing God
[2:03:26] [Applause]
[2:03:30] says the last pictures of the
[2:03:33] Bride is as manifested
[2:03:37] sons who under who are under the
[2:03:40] anointing and the power of the mighty
[2:03:44] Angel the final prophecy will be the
[2:03:48] bride's Voice who has eaten and digested
[2:03:51] the book and the word has become flesh
[2:03:54] in
[2:03:56] them and by doing that it positions and
[2:04:00] places them in the promised land of the
[2:04:03] Bible making them to
[2:04:06] prophesy
[2:04:10] again remember they overcame by the word
[2:04:13] of their
[2:04:14] testimony this is how we overcome by the
[2:04:17] word of our prophecy testifying of what
[2:04:20] the word said
[2:04:22] now eating the book requires
[2:04:27] maturity you see one who is the age of
[2:04:31] adoption who is fully able to digest the
[2:04:35] Deep things of God
[2:04:37] Amen now this positions them in a place
[2:04:41] of
[2:04:42] authority until they
[2:04:44] prophesy or become God's
[2:04:47] voice now the Mysteries are not revealed
[2:04:51] until there are a people on Earth who
[2:04:55] can digest them and manifest them now
[2:05:00] that's why there was milk and a little
[2:05:03] gr maybe that was added down to the
[2:05:07] ages but in this last day he talks about
[2:05:11] people who comes of full
[2:05:17] age Hebrews
[2:05:19] 5:3 everyone that use milk is unskillful
[2:05:24] in the word of righteousness for he is
[2:05:25] the made and that's what we've had we've
[2:05:28] had people who have been unskillful
[2:05:31] Luther was
[2:05:32] unskillful in the word of
[2:05:35] righteousness he got the milk of
[2:05:39] justification amen but he you know he he
[2:05:44] laed a lot of things he was unskillful
[2:05:46] in the word of righteousness for example
[2:05:50] he didn't like the Jews right so
[2:05:52] therefore he brought a persecution upon
[2:05:55] the Jewish
[2:05:56] people and and because he didn't see
[2:05:58] them he was unskillful in the word of
[2:06:02] righteousness he didn't see them in
[2:06:04] their place and position as God's chosen
[2:06:07] people a physical people where we're a
[2:06:10] spiritual people he he was unskillful in
[2:06:14] the word of
[2:06:16] righteousness where he would still hold
[2:06:19] on to a trinity Doctrine he was
[2:06:22] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[2:06:25] where he still sprinkled instead of
[2:06:29] immersed we're talking about simple
[2:06:32] things but he enjoyed as a babe the milk
[2:06:38] of justification that's
[2:06:41] right right and so it has been all down
[2:06:46] to these ages maybe as I said a little
[2:06:49] more gr lay you know little GRL
[2:06:51] something like like feeding a baby you
[2:06:53] feed him milk but sometime mama will mix
[2:06:56] that milk with a with a a little bit of
[2:06:59] um meal or something you know that that
[2:07:02] she does she mixes together and she
[2:07:04] brings out something a little more
[2:07:06] substance as milk and it's getting ready
[2:07:09] to
[2:07:10] eat eat
[2:07:12] meat but it's not ready for
[2:07:16] meat I was brought little babies in my
[2:07:18] arms today that are are fat on the milk
[2:07:23] and healthy with what they
[2:07:26] have but they can't live on that all the
[2:07:29] rest of their
[2:07:30] life in order to to come to a maturity
[2:07:35] they're going to have to learn to eat
[2:07:37] other
[2:07:38] things and I want you to look at this
[2:07:42] until finally verse 14 says but strong
[2:07:46] meat strong meat belong to them that are
[2:07:49] of full age
[2:07:53] yes now we're talking about a mature
[2:07:56] church amen we're talking about mature
[2:07:59] Sons we're talking about sons who are
[2:08:02] being
[2:08:03] placed positioned and robed with
[2:08:07] authority but show meat belonging to
[2:08:09] them that are full age even who by
[2:08:12] reason of use have their senses
[2:08:14] exercised to discern both good and evil
[2:08:19] so these are men these are men of full
[2:08:24] age so if he gives the meat of the word
[2:08:28] he has to have a people that matches
[2:08:31] that word that can digest that
[2:08:34] word now you know some things are hard
[2:08:38] to
[2:08:40] take amen some things are hard to
[2:08:45] digest some things you need to chew on a
[2:08:48] long
[2:08:49] time it's part of the D digestion after
[2:08:52] while after all right you chew on it you
[2:08:56] get it there it's got to get down where
[2:08:58] the gastic ju juices are flowing and and
[2:09:02] there and consume the meat it belongs to
[2:09:06] them who are a full age so Revelation
[2:09:10] 108 he could not hand the book to Luther
[2:09:13] he was unskillful in the word of
[2:09:15] righteousness he was a milk
[2:09:19] Drinker on
[2:09:24] Hallelujah Wesley the same isusa street
[2:09:27] the same amen all of them are milk
[2:09:30] drinkers but you know what the age turns
[2:09:33] from man to an eagle and an eagle eats
[2:09:38] meat from
[2:09:40] [Music]
[2:09:42] birth amen you young people get the Holy
[2:09:46] Ghost and from your birth you are able
[2:09:50] to eat the meat of the word it's for you
[2:09:53] it's for our children it's for all of us
[2:09:55] come on church that ain't nothing too
[2:09:58] high nothing too great nothing too
[2:10:00] Wonders that you can't
[2:10:05] receive
[2:10:08] now brother brandham says about adoption
[2:10:11] he says now this may choke you to death
[2:10:14] so it's going to take a lot of chewing
[2:10:16] on
[2:10:19] it cuz strong meat
[2:10:22] requires
[2:10:23] chewing you know I went over to Africa
[2:10:26] many times I'd sit there with the
[2:10:29] African brothers and there they have you
[2:10:31] know their big white teeth shining out
[2:10:35] of those those beautiful black faces and
[2:10:39] here you can see great big strong teeth
[2:10:43] you know there I never saw one with
[2:10:45] braces on maybe they have to I don't
[2:10:48] know but anyway I've never seen them
[2:10:50] with a with a bunch of crooked stuff
[2:10:53] they were all
[2:10:55] strong them men they would we sit around
[2:10:58] the table and and uh he they'd say I
[2:11:02] like hard
[2:11:06] chicken and I'm an American I said I
[2:11:10] like salt
[2:11:14] chicken I said I like my
[2:11:17] chicken you know where I can pull it off
[2:11:19] the bone and eat it and swall
[2:11:22] it I don't like chicken that when I get
[2:11:25] a bite of it I
[2:11:29] go and it slaps me back in the
[2:11:33] face oh no brother Tim we love our
[2:11:36] chicken hard I said well you know hard
[2:11:40] chicken is chicken that's run out there
[2:11:42] and he's run himself until all his
[2:11:44] muscles are are just hard as a rock and
[2:11:47] that's the way they want him
[2:11:49] said we even eat the bum
[2:11:59] but you see that would choke us
[2:12:01] Americans to
[2:12:03] death but I want you to know there are
[2:12:06] men and women of this age that are a
[2:12:08] full
[2:12:09] age that can take strong
[2:12:13] meat Hallelujah and they can keep it
[2:12:16] down they can digest it if it's Holiness
[2:12:20] if is
[2:12:22] godliness amen whatever it is we can
[2:12:25] digest it we can keep it down and we can
[2:12:30] prophesy by the strength of
[2:12:35] it
[2:12:37] now brother brandham said this may choke
[2:12:41] you but did you know that men that are
[2:12:45] sons of God are amateur
[2:12:48] Gods what you're an amateur God M how
[2:12:52] many ever knew that how many knows that
[2:12:54] Jesus said so the Bible Jesus said did
[2:12:57] not your law say itself you are gods and
[2:12:58] if you call them God so let's go to John
[2:13:01] 10:34 where he's pulling this
[2:13:03] from and Jesus answered them is it not
[2:13:06] written in your law I said you are Gods
[2:13:11] well let me just stop for a minute if he
[2:13:13] said we're Gods we're
[2:13:16] Gods amen come on now let's go back to
[2:13:19] some simple genetics
[2:13:22] amen dogs bring forth dogs cats bring
[2:13:26] forth
[2:13:27] cats monkeys bring forth
[2:13:30] monkeys men bring forth other men or
[2:13:33] humans bring forth
[2:13:35] humans but when God
[2:13:40] reproduces what does he do he produces
[2:13:43] another Son of
[2:13:46] God did not isn't it written in your law
[2:13:50] in the word
[2:13:51] I
[2:13:53] said you're my
[2:13:55] children and if you're my children
[2:13:57] you're heirs and Joint HS while you are
[2:14:02] gods and as a God you have
[2:14:07] dominion as an adopted as a son adopted
[2:14:10] place you have
[2:14:12] dominion if you call them gods and to
[2:14:15] whom the word of God came and the
[2:14:19] scripture cannot be broken okay well
[2:14:22] brother Tim that was prophets yeah and
[2:14:24] the prophet the prophets did he called
[2:14:26] them Gods whom the word of God came to
[2:14:30] right prophets but you are also people
[2:14:35] to whom the word of God has
[2:14:37] come go take the book out of the hand of
[2:14:41] the
[2:14:42] Angel so did he not say you are gods and
[2:14:47] with that godship comes Dominion
[2:14:53] [Music]
[2:14:55] now if he called him Gods un to whom to
[2:15:00] whom the word of the L of God came to
[2:15:03] and we've receiv received God's word and
[2:15:05] the scripture cannot bre broken so if
[2:15:07] we're another people that has received
[2:15:10] the word then we also are
[2:15:14] Gods amen so then he said then say you
[2:15:18] of him whom the father has Sanctified
[2:15:20] and sent into the world thou BL
[2:15:22] blasphemist because I said I am the Son
[2:15:25] of
[2:15:26] God so you see they were saying he
[2:15:29] blasphemed because he called himself the
[2:15:31] Son of
[2:15:32] God and he said how can I blaspheme when
[2:15:36] God said that about
[2:15:38] me and what about you listen I know what
[2:15:40] the devil's been saying of you he's the
[2:15:44] accuser of your bre of the Brethren come
[2:15:46] on so he's there accusing you all the
[2:15:48] time but God said amen
[2:15:51] that you are
[2:15:54] Gods Hallelujah this is the Bible he
[2:15:57] said which in Genesis too that they were
[2:15:59] Gods because they had full domain with
[2:16:02] dominion over the world he gave him
[2:16:04] dominion over all things and he lost his

[2:20:42] tree we have suffered from the results
[2:20:45] of
[2:20:46] that for six days of man
[2:20:51] 6,000
[2:20:52] years but there's about a millennium

[2:21:18] blowing and that's why all the
[2:21:21] opposition is coming in this last day

[2:21:29] a people now eating from Christ amen

[2:21:44] the death the sorrow but now there's a
[2:21:47] people eating off the tree of life
[2:21:52] you believe Jesus taught that he said in
[2:21:55] John
[2:21:56] 6:54 whosoever eateth My Flesh and
[2:21:59] drinketh my blood hath eternal life now
[2:22:03] we know that's symbology of the word and
[2:22:06] the
[2:22:07] spirit he that eateth my flesh and
[2:22:10] drinketh my blood John 6:54 hath eternal

[2:22:28] dwelleth in me and I in him as a living
[2:22:31] father has sent me and I live by the
[2:22:34] father so he that eateth me shall even
[2:22:36] live by me this is that bread which came
[2:22:40] down from heaven not as your fathers did
[2:22:42] eat mana and are dead he that eateth of

[2:23:07] will know you e in the
[2:23:10] book you become one with the word cuz
[2:23:13] it's going to speak out of your life
[2:23:15] that's right every True Believer is the
[2:23:18] voice of God Jesus said would be did you
[2:23:22] know that Jesus said that Matthew 10:19
[2:23:26] let me read it to you when they deliver
[2:23:28] you up when you are questioned take no
[2:23:31] thought about what you shall speak for
[2:23:34] it shall be given to you in the same
[2:23:37] hour what you shall speak for it is not
[2:23:39] you that speak but the spirit of your
[2:23:41] father which speaketh in
[2:23:43] you hallelujah we're talking about a
[2:23:46] people here in the last day that the
[2:23:48] spirit the Holy Ghost is speaking
[2:23:50] through that you don't even have to take
[2:23:52] a thought it lives automatically out of
[2:23:57] your
[2:23:58] life so the bride is The Voice or the
[2:24:02] Archangel for the Archangel is Christ
[2:24:05] and the voice of God is in her now let's
[2:24:07] be clear it is not don't don't think
[2:24:11] this carnally because it's not going to
[2:24:12] be a bunch of people out with a magic
[2:24:15] oneand waving this wand or screaming
[2:24:18] screaming a bunch of people running in
[2:24:20] the graveyards calling the dead it will
[2:24:22] be the atmosphere of Christ in his bride
[2:24:26] made so real until the blending of those
[2:24:31] atmospheres the dead come
[2:24:37] here look you see all around you the
[2:24:40] advancement of
[2:24:42] science you see autonomous cars right
[2:24:46] Rising on the scene you see great atomic
[2:24:50] nuclear bombs that are being
[2:24:53] built things they didn't even have
[2:24:56] knowledge or science for mysterious
[2:24:59] things that they have done things that's
[2:25:02] hard to even wrap your mind around of
[2:25:04] unseen things begin to twist in the
[2:25:08] Unseen of the atoms and and and and
[2:25:12] exploding there and causing
[2:25:18] destruction so it's a day is an hour
[2:25:21] where knowledge has
[2:25:23] increased men are running to and fro and
[2:25:26] knowledge has increased and all of these
[2:25:28] things like Daniel 12 and it's at that
[2:25:31] time that Michael stands
[2:25:35] up Hallelujah and right now when we need
[2:25:38] it the holy spirit is lifting a standard
[2:25:42] against the enemy and what is that
[2:25:45] standard and I saw another Mighty angel
[2:25:49] coming down from Heaven brother Brandon

[2:26:15] living and finally being united together

[2:26:20] altar the under the grave under the
[2:26:23] altar of God are crying how long Lord

[2:29:08] resurrection power that has taken you
[2:29:10] out of sin made a son and daughter of
[2:29:13] God out of you and you're exemplifying
