we'd like to thank you for that I'm deeply honored to stand here and for those that know it's a phenomenal miracle that we're able to be here and to stand here once again and defy the odds and we're we're so honored at that I want to remember sister Erica this morning that God would just touch her she has a great need and we just know that God's able for sister Erica and myself there was a conversation that took place in a cave that conversation led to the disease that we would fight and that disease of liver cancer that she has to fight and I stand here fighting brain cancer and lung cancer but that's nothing to God [Music] and when the angel said not even cancer not even cancer God was looking down the realm and seeing us standing here and so you know but maybe your cancer sin and it's way more deadly than the one that I'm fighting you see if you hear that I die or don't you believe it for a second I'll be more alive there than I am here but I want you I come with a burden on my heart that the cancer that you're fighting can be delivered this weekend and every every part of that cancer can be dissolved and it's not by chemo it's by the blood of Jesus Christ and it's already paid for love you honored to be here we we have been praying for brother Aaron and his family and and sister Linda we're praying amen to step from this realm to another realm is a great thing

course brother Tim and I have been friends and brother Donnie have been friends a long long time and so not going to tell you how many years they told it last night no need and reiterating it so amen so we love them I saw sister Ella here last night amen LIC in the building today amen we're so honored to be a part of her life and what she is is a miracle in progress and so amen amen I'd like to speak to you today on what will you be remembered for what will you be remembered for great books have a lot of parts they have introductions the chapters are lined up generally in the first chapter it's a it's a chapter of grabbing your attention so that you won't lay the 300 Page book down it grabs your attention in a way to where that you've realized that if I don't read this book I'm going to be missing a part in my life it brings great Intrigue to it then it begins to go into the body of work it's the it's the behind the scenes chaos brings the miracle together of life then as it begins to come to the winding down of it to leave you with great great feelings it begins to come toward the final chapters and as it comes to the final chapters it will bring conclusion to your life there's a lot of things that you will accomplish in your life but I'd like to just kind of give you a little little teaser without Jesus without Jesus it's not even worth living I want you to understand there were millionaires when Martin Luther were here John Wesley was here we know nothing about them we know absolutely nothing about them but we know a man named John Wesley that preached about 88 000 sermons that was the messenger to his day we know something about him because his work was incredibly important we know something about the messenger of this day That Shook the Earth that was allowed to be a vessel of Malachi 4. because you were the one that was important because this book was after you I'm thankful I thank the Lord to be here to kind of to be at the part of the starting of your life because starting is important if you're going to run a race you want to start right when you get into the blocks of running you want to put your feet right you want your breathing right you want your mind right you want to be focused those first few steps are incredibly important that's one of the things that this meeting is so important the focus is to make sure you're start and your continuation maybe many of you been here for years but the continuing of the work it is so important if you will turn with me to Luke chapter 23 John chapter 23 and verse 26. I said John it's Luke I'm not a bit nervous Luke chapter 23 and verse 26. I'd like to have my wife with me my family with me Andrew with me you see a miracle I may be a miracle in flesh he's a miracle and and soul and so you can't make your children Christians but when you see them get a supernatural text that's a miracle Luke chapter 23 and verse 26. and as they led him away they laid hold upon one Simon a serene coming out of the country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after Jesus and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also beweld and lamented but Jesus turned unto them and said Daughters of Jerusalem wheat not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children for behold the days are coming in which they shall say blessed are the baronen and the wounds that never bear and the paths which never gave suck then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the heels cover us for if they do these things in a green tree what shall they be done in a dry there were also two other malfactors LED with him to be put to death and when they were come to the place which is called Calvary They Crucified him and the mouth actors one on the right hand and the other on the left and then Jesus then said Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his Rhema and cast lots and the people stood beholding and the rulers also which deriled him saying he saved others let him save himself if he made the Christ the chosen one and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar and saying if thou be the king of the Jews save thyself and the super subscription also that was written over him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew this is the king of the Jews maybe you have a need this morning you just like to say Lord remember me father we bow our heads before you now this morning Lord needing strength not only recovering from long trips many have come from many different directions now our minds are beginning to as last night begin to pull us in focus of what our mission is here now Lord I pray that every devil that has tried to derail even their coming maybe even their thoughts we ask you now that you would just come now and focus us like never before Lord anoint the speaker anoint the hearers this morning Lord we're here to do business for The King and I ask you to anoint these young people father speak to our hearts Lord all the way to the back of the building anoint us in a special way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen amen you can be seated in John chapter 16 and verse 4. and Jesus is speaking to his Believers and these things have I told you that that when the when the time shall come ye may remember what I have told you of them and these things I said not unto you at the beginning because I was with you notice how this book is unfolding it's a progressive and now I go my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh me where there goest thou but because I have said these things unto you sorrow hath filled your hearts nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you and when he has come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of Judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because I go to my father and ye shall see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged he's saying a whole lot in a few sentences chapters are changing you're going to be a part of this you're going to shake the world Satan is defeated I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever ye shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he will glorify me for he shall receive and of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you a little while and you shall not see me and again a little while and you shall see me because I go unto the father brother Branham would say it like this and he's talking about Satan he took him up on a mountain and he set him down and he rebuked him again with the word he defeated Satan with the word of God now he's going to bring you into the picture and maybe none of us have seen brother Branham personally but brother Bradham is going to give us a nugget here for us defeated Satan with the word of God showing that the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan with thus saith the Lord it is written it is written it is written Jesus didn't do it with his power he did it with the word of God and that is the greatest weapon that you can have a covenant with God and he gives you the words of life and you take those words as a believer your position and you take the words of eternal life and use it on the devil he's used to being defeated with the word of God [Applause] a point would write it like this he is the first and the last the beginning and the end he is the keeper of creation he is the creator of it all he is the architect of the universe the manager of all times he always was he always is he always will be he's unmoved he's unchanged he's undefeated he's never undone he was bruised and brought healing he was pierced and he's pain he was persecuted and brought Freedom he was dead and brought life he is risen and brings power He Reigns and brings peace the world can't understand him armies can't defeat him schools can't explain him leaders can't ignore him Harry couldn't kill him Pharisees couldn't confuse him the people couldn't hold him Nero couldn't crush him Hitler couldn't silence him the new age can't replace him he is light love longevity he is my Lord he is goodness and kindness he is generous and he is God he is Holy he is righteous he is mighty he is powerful he is pure his words are always right his word is eternal his will is unchanging his mind is on me he is my savior he is my guide he is my peace he is my joy he is my comfort he is my Lord he rules my life I serve him because his bond is love his burden is light his goal for me is Abundant Life I follow him because his wisdom is wise and Powerful of the powerful he's the Ancient of Days the ruler of rulers the leader of the leaders the overseer of overcome us [Applause] that is impressive to you try this on for size his goal and his relationship is with me [Applause] he will never leave me he will never forsake me he will never mislead me he will never forget me he will never Overlook me he will never counsel my appointment in his appointment book when I fall he lifts me up when I fail he forgives me when I am weak he is strong when I am lost he is my way when I am afraid he is my courage when I Stumble he steadies me when I am hurt he heals me when I am broken he mends me when I am blind he leads me when I am hungry he feeds me when I face trials he is with me when I face persecution he seals me when I face problems he comfort me when I face laws he provides for me when I face death he carries me home he is God [Applause] I am his and he is mine everything that he owns he has given it to us now tell me we're some weak where she worship where the Queen of Heaven thank you [Applause] I have read that over the last three years hundreds of times I've often thought about what it must have felt like in the room where the author was writing and the Holy Spirit was helping he put that together because there would be a lot of people like you that would need to read it again to inspire it again I've often thought about the Apostle Paul when he writes the book of Hebrews he's going to capture men's lives and maybe they lived hundreds of years maybe just only a few years and he's going to capture a portion of the lives in a sentence the book of Hebrews chapter 11 is a hall of faith people that by faith receive the promise we heard last night that Satan Stacks a lot of facts against us but whose report do we believe I exposed myself today and stand here before you they've told me over and over again of of my end and how will billion all of those different kinds of things gave me months to live set and cried with me listen they were doing their bestest doctors they're practicing Physicians trying to help Mankind we appreciate doctors and nurses and Medicine we appreciate what they do but we have a higher doctor [Applause] he may be unseen but you can feel him in the room it may not be your faith but he reaches down and grabs a halt to you and when you equipped our Prophet wanted to quit many great leaders wanted to quit maybe you've wanted to quit every great person has wanted to quit at some point but you would have quit if you could but there was a lot more chapters that had to be written there was a lot more sermons that had to be preached there's a lot more things that you've got to do in your life and maybe you can't see your future but there's books and chapters that have to be written in your life but brother Ron I'm a nobody foreign I made a lot of failures well let me let me just share a couple from background Noah was a drunk Abraham was too old Isaac was a Daydreamer Jacob was a liar Leo was ugly but she was hated but she brought forth Judah and then she would be one that would say I will now praise the Lord it didn't matter about being hated it didn't matter about being ugly listen if we could ever come to a party in our lives God made us like we are if we could ever come to the Comfort in our own spirit quit looking at pattern after Hollywood and realize that God made us us exactly how we are [Applause] tall short skinny fluffy nervous Philip I saw you look nervous stubborn high tension great passion driven God knew every element that he put in your body he knew what you would be like because he had a book that he had to write and he had your name on it [Applause] and regardless of how you feel about your Humanity that's only the Temple part he put a seed on the inside of you [Music] of eternal life the very Jean seed of God no he's not counting on your flesh he's not counting on your flesh but he has confidence in the sea that he put on the inside of you and if that seed comes to life you will realize that there's a lot of chapters that's got to be taken place Rahab was a prostitute David had a an affair and was a murderer Elijah was suicidal Jonah ran from God wound up in a great fish Joe went bankrupt even Peter after all that he saw denied the Lord he walked away cursed used abominable names the disciples fell asleep while Jesus was praying his most critical prayer his disciples fell asleep that's what gives us preachers hope [Music] the Samaritan woman was divorced over and over and over again yet Jesus went to her out of his way when the disciples couldn't see nothing good in her and no church actually wanted her Jesus said I can use her now your first few pages of your book may have a lot of these things in it you see you've written those things you've lived those things you know those things about yourself it's difficult maybe for Moses to write High tempered strapped The Rock twice difficult that he has to write his Humanity no doubt difficult for brother Branham to be honest and tell us mistakes in fact I'm glad he did I'm really glad he did that he that he just shared with us his Humanity that he made mistakes it gives you confidence to get back up [Music] let me just say oh my brother Ron this is Hollywood this is you know when I become a Christian all my troubles will be over with look around take a deep breath look around God is going to overcome and you so there's going to be some battles there's some battles that lays ahead of you there's some real difficult times that lays ahead for you there's some discouragements that lays ahead for you but it's his Divine will friends are going to walk away from you I'm talking about Bosom Buddies they're going to walk away from you and if you can only realize if they can walk away from you it wasn't your friend to start off with [Music] and let me just say if if your friends are not taking you toward God they're not your friends [Music] [Applause] if the power of your influence around you is not in a Revival of the message of the hour hungry for God hungry for church if all of their minds is just total carnality all the times they're not guiding you in the right direction [Applause] I know all of us has got friends that are in the world but let me just say this you don't let them influence your life by faith Abraham by faith Jacob by faith Moses by faith Joshua by faith or Ahab if you'll notice he mentions her here God's not ashamed that she was a harlot he's not ashamed of where you are now let me just say God knows how to take the actor's mask off he knows the real you [Applause] and so he wants the real you to know the real him Rahab knew that these two spies had something that she had never never had in her life she had met a lot of men from that City but none of them had what they had and circumstances of Life had bound her to that position circumstances and chains kept her there working on the wall in the red light district but God knew if I can only get the pen out of her hand and put it in my hat I've got a plan for her if God can only get the pen of Will and self-will out of your hands [Music] and get it into his hand and you become a prisoner to Jesus Christ a love slave oh my brother Ron I have to do this and I have to give up this if you ever meet Jesus there's nothing in this world that matters anymore Super Bowls won't matter no more Hollywood won't matter no more racing won't matter no more rock and roll won't matter anymore [Applause] you and Jesus are a majority [Music] the scripture says in Hebrews 11 32 and notice how Paul begins to write these things he said what more shall I say for the time should fail me to tell you of Gideon I loved that last night on a balark and of Samson and of jaffna and of David and of Samuel and of the prophets been these men live phenomenal lives had phenomenal Supernatural lives David kills a giant with a stone Moses stands and watches the water raise up Sampson puts his hand on the pillars and he's blind and he pushes and kills more people at his death than all of his life but when God looks at it through the prophet Paul he just mentions the name all in a sentence well brother Ron but I didn't get a full chapter in the Bible don't matter all right maybe you're like shamgar and you just got one scripture in my whole book but one man got so tired of the enemy coming into his camp and God would take brother Branham The Seer of the word the one that could look in the Garden of Eden and see exactly what Eve looked like and exactly what the serpent looked like and how they walked out of the Garden of Eden could also look in shamgar's life oh my brother on maybe he was making up a story really and he begins to talk about him and as he begins to talk about him said no doubt the enemy had came year after year after year and had taken all the crop and left him just enough to get him through the till next camp meeting and it could get back to the next Youth Camp and here comes 600 Philistines armed trained soldiers he wasn't a soldier he was a farmer and he said he looked over at his wife and how skinny she was and threads on her clothes was just Barren and he explains it in great detail because God remembers God remembers it may have been thousands of years later but one scripture was important to the prophet and it was important to God don't tell me your life is not important to God don't tell me you're a nobody maybe the enemy has come with 600 Devils to your house day after day after day and trying to destroy you is it going to be just another day is it going to be just another time something responded in the inside of of shamgar that he was a Seed of Abraham and he remembered that in the word that Abraham had set with Melchizedek and Melchizedek had said thy said shall possess the gates of their enemy and he picked up a stick and he started beating for listings one at a time [Applause] one at a time Brother David I say one at a time one fell that gave him courage for the second one that gave him courage for the third one that gave him courage for the fourth one that gave them courage for The Temper he gave him courage for the 50th one [Applause] about your sticks [Applause] what about your stick God give you the courage to pick it up give me the courage to start [Music] come out of the gate ready I am a Seed of Abraham I am the blood of Jesus Christ the final voice to the final age you didn't think that about yourself that's what God sent you was you are the super race you didn't think that about yourself that's what God thought of you I sent you a bone of your bones bone of these bones life of his life [Applause] he calls you an invincible Army [Applause] that isn't just a family's phrase that comes around that wasn't just William branham's phrase about you that was God's phrase God saved you till the end of the layout of seal knowing the wars that were going to come against you the spirits are going to come against you brother Brown said your mother faced ten times the Devils that are her mother face then you're the Next Generation faces a hundred times what the mother face then it multiplies to a thousand but God didn't leave you depleted I want you to punch your neighbor and tell him that preacher is talking about you it's all about you it's all about you Marcus I'm talking about you talking about you come on you came a long way and I picked you out he's talking about you he's talking about you back there Carl I'm talking about you sorry sister Carter that's my sister listen I'm talking about you I'm talking about every one of you and I want to get this right brother you know I'm done by you we're an invincible Army because we will not pay attention to the facts [Applause] [Applause] yeah we could get killed here in a few minutes destroyed what are you gonna do I got a stick can you imagine what the family was doing somebody's got a shout somebody's got to sing so his family was back I don't know near the barn while he was in the field with a stick in his hand and he's going to whip him so bad I can heal it as he knocks the last one down scream I don't never come back [Applause] [Applause] all right now it's your turn why don't you tell those less devils music devils those backslidden Devils why don't you tell them why you hit them in the head don't come back no more foreign [Applause] no here's what I want you to do this is exercise part of it because the most Supernatural thing about you is your tongue and it has the power to produce a negative atmosphere or it has the power to speak the spoken word do you know why we sink we sing testimonies victory is mine victory is mine there is going to be a meeting in the air and you pass those powerful inspired words across your lips and your ears hear what you are saying because your voice is different than anybody else's voice and God hears your voice through the blood are you with me now we're getting to some good parts why don't you pick up your six foot stick and I want to hear you say not your neighbor I want you to say to the devil don't come back now say it with attitude you're getting a dog come back [Applause] I'm going to share something with you that I probably shouldn't preachers do that but in my life I've been a boxing fan you know because God was going to make me a boxer and I spent about an hour here knocking the enemy out brother Branham was a boxer and he was going to be honest with you that's why I got started liking boxing because I was a little boy out here brother Brandon talking about his fights talk about training and talking about hitting with the left and hitting with the right now that all got me in trouble when I became a late teenager because I practiced it one of the greatest Corner men was a man named Angelo Dundee Angelo Dungey was not a fighter but he knew how to coach some of the greatest that ever lived Aaron you're going to love this I can just hear it in a few sermons from now brother Ron said Angelo Dundee said when I would have Muhammad Ali in in the boxing match he said I didn't have to teach him how to fight he knew how to fight he he said but I had to remind him of who he was thank you [Applause] so many times he was getting whipped and outpointed he said I didn't tell him about lefts and rights he didn't tell him about ducking his head he said I had to tell him you are the champion you are the champion now go fight lasiks [Applause] I like one of the things he said that other guy knows you're the champion yeah he believes you're the champion who says coming so give it to him [Applause] now let me just say this to you if I can be Angelo Dundee for a few minutes I don't have to tell you how to fight it's on the inside of you I don't have to give you the weapons you've already got it I just got to remind you of Who You Are okay if you're 13 or you're 35. you're a champion your bill can do the job [Applause] now in a book in a book you're right in it and sometimes you remember the difficult parts and Satan will bring those difficult Parts back to you because he don't really have a lot to work with once you know who you are all he can do is pick on your flesh and your memory and your conscience and he wants to remind you and keep you defeated so can you give me about 10 more minutes [Applause] well brother Ron You Don't Preach like you used to well I had to reinvent myself a little bit just because I got cancer in my lungs and it hurts when I preach don't mean I quit I just learned how to fight a little different that means my lefts and rights come quick and they come harsh and foreign [Applause] his book had been a horrible book it would be something that you would read in Halloween it was horrendous it was nothing to be proud of he had made failure after failure after failure we don't know nothing about his family we don't know nothing about him other than he's in jail I'm being in jail he's incarcerated and anybody can live right in jail well I think I've found some people that's been in jail before and so he's in jail he's he's been caught the law says that he's got to die now you would think as he's coming into his final week that this is the last chapter but this is only the beginning now today it's a strange sort of day he's going to die with a God that's had a book like his but there's another man there's another man that's with him he don't deserve to die he's he'll sick he's fed thousands he's turned water into wine now this this thief has never heard a sermon he's never saw a miracle he's going to have to carry his cross up the hill but he's going to witness something he's going to witness a man as he walks out and starts up the journey that refuses to quit he immediately notices that he's been beaten like no other human being has ever been beaten he can see the pulsation of his lungs and the pulsations of his organs in his body what screaming down through his cloth little dots become big dots he can see the human fatigue setting in on him but he refuses to quit putting one foot in front of the other maybe you don't understand why their stripes are there but they're there for Erica [Music] they're there for you [Applause] listen don't ever give up don't you ever give up I say this to you when it comes and it seems like all is hopeless let me just say God's got it he's the doctor he didn't quit neither said way he didn't get The Strokes neither should we maybe it was possible in his mind you see he hadn't got to read the book maybe it's possible by his mind and Jesus didn't have time to turn around and say I'm doing this for Tim Pruitt I'm doing this for Karen you see she wasn't defeated oh but brother on if you could have only saw what I saw I was here with you but if you could see like brother Donnie was anointed to speak her funeral and look across the Veil she's got a new body that's what Jesus was walking up the hill for because it was in the book and Elijah and Moses had stood there with him on the Mount of transfiguration and told him what the word said he had to accomplish it if I can say this to you today we must accomplish our work s are screaming at a store we must accomplish we must finish this [Applause] [Music] he watches every step that he takes there's blood in it if you look at his own Footprints and there was no blood the man with him there was no blood but this man had blood nobody was screaming their name saying Blasphemous names they deserved it they deserve to die that book was written so that the Justice was that they died but this man Satan would not let him die without extremely punishment not just to his body but to his mind so they screamed at him all kind of horrible words they offered him vinegar they said incredibly bad things about him but he kept stepping this man heard the moans this man heard the cross because Jesus had to die as a man as that man he had to suffer Adam fell if Satan would have only knew what was happening today Jesus would have had Band-Aids all over him he would have made him King of the universe he'd never let him go to counseling but God shall hear himself if he only knew who he was and he only knew who he was he would not torment you another day he would not matter you another day because at the end of the day your testing on it will destroy him therefore that fights against you every demon of hair that tries to destroy you against them cause his kingdom to come to an end [Applause] Nails in his hands Nails in his feet the groans people are screaming all different kind of things because I'll be the Christ you saved others save yourself the greatest compliment they could ever pay him you saved others save yourself one Thief screams across at him if you are the Christ save us makes all kind of fun of it and the other one that's all of this took it into his mind he wasn't thinking about how great he was he knew in a few minutes he's going to die and this is what he deserved he never heard a sermon on a mount had never seen him touch the leopard he never heard Lazarus come forth but he had enough pressure in his lungs that he could say Lord when you come into your kingdom remember me remember me his book started Christ where his book started everything else didn't matter now being a thief having a wretched life it didn't matter now his blood of all the miracles of Jesus the last one was the costliest it must have been a complete Paradox all of these preachers on the ground making fun all these great religious people making sure that he dies [Music] they had scream crucify him and here's a man with a destroyed book screaming remember me God's got a memory God's got a memory how important is remember me I don't know for this local audience can I just put an expert here last week by the Carmen meals we listen to him together brother Carmen Mills speaks on God's memory sister Esther gets up at the end of it under anointing so this is my time almost a month ago I announced to the audience of what I was going to speak here I never do that or what will you be remembered for I told brother Tim I said God's got something in plans I want you to catch it now God's got something in his plans I preached this two times before one in Switzerland every time I preached it phenomenal Miracles happened and the same gods in the building now [Applause] I don't know about your book I we don't have time for you to tell every page of your book but you being here you being here tell us this that God has gathered you [Music] because he has remembered you he put something on you inside of you on these days he put us something down on the inside of you that you had to get here 29 minutes to fill this Camp up you were excited to get here you wasn't buying rock and roll tickets you wasn't buying Super Bowl tickets you was under inspiration to be in this camp you didn't know what you'd be saying that it never be raining like it is maybe your book's got a lot of scars and you're not so proud of it if you could look over tonight and say Remember Me Lord remember me remember me and Jesus turns to him and says this day you're talking about a change of a book you check I'm talking about a change of Heaven and Hell in hell you fall you Falls like an endless eternity there's no friends in hell there's weeping and nation of teeth the Holocaust is like a Sunday afternoon picnic it's a horrendous place to go no friends there no parties there it's done to flip it to a place where Satan can never touch you again [Applause] this day this day you'll be with me in Paradise I don't know how I felt I don't know what sensation he felt but his destination was different [Applause] we do not know how he died we don't know the exact minute that he left the Earth but it was not a demon coming to get him [Music] it was an angel became his Uber driver you see that man throughout his life and his decades that he lived didn't know he was destined for that God had bigger plans the woman at the well didn't know she was destined for that Rahab didn't know she was destined for that maybe you didn't know you were destined for that but God's got big plans in your life maybe you show up at church and Timothy's preaching God changes your book maybe brother Donnie leaves these quotes for a little bit and leaves his portion that he's had and all of a sudden you become in the picture and you go my God that man's talking about me God's got plans for you that's what this meeting is all about God's got plans for you as I finish let me just say this to you it wasn't that you picked you God picked you [Applause] you see us he's looking and knowing who's going to be in every age and he picks brother Branham as the last Church age messenger then he's going to pick seed that will believe that now he's got to have some that's in brother Brandon's meetings and they'll sit and say amen and that's a prophet that's Elijah but just before Resurrection he's got to have young people that will literally live in the darkness of laodicea and know that they can't do it on their own it's so dark they can't make it so they know that if God don't pick up the pen if God don't pick up my pen I'm going to make a mess out of my life I'm going to choose the wrong mate I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna have the wrong job I'm going to wind up out of church but if God picks up your pen he knows where he needs you at [Applause] now you see a few years ago that guy that's standing over there no that's not Goliath that's one of Goliath's killers it was in a meeting like this that he was just enjoying writing a book but now God needed him to be a preacher and I'm sure that that evening you know no man calls a man to preach we just kind of recognize the gift and there's no way that you would have thought that guy's going to be a convention speaker but that guy's a phenomenal preacher listen I am not bragging on him I'm bragging on the gift that's in him you see he had to lay the pin down football coach teacher he had to lay the pin down because God needed him well he did good at your place brother Donnie God needed him to allow him to pick him up and now write with him yeah no longer his ambition writing with him listen you being that Prescott's coach that don't mean nothing but you inspiring young people like this that's what it's about that's what you'll be remembered for [Applause] I could go all over this audience but I'll come to this Esther you won't be remembered for a barren woman you'll be remembered for predestinated seed born through your womb Erica if you've got the strength to hear you and I won't be known for people that just survived cancer I don't even know if it'll be a page in the book that's how much God will be known for people that looked at cancer and went what cancer [Applause] mother Joel I'm sure Erica's alike I've got to stack about that tall
