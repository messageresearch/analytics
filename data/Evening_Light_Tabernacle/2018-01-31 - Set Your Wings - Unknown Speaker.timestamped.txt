[2:10] need what you try

[2:21] Word of God by and by it will move are
[2:27] you fly
[2:31] many years ago I was in bound up in
[2:36] Canada Hildebrand's took me up there my
[2:43] wife and I
[2:45] we went up into the national park those
[2:50] towering mountains simple snow-capped
[2:53] they had glaciers took a bus went for
[2:58] miles up on the mountain I don't know
[3:01] how far wind it around but we got up
[3:04] there then we walked up on the glacier
[3:08] seen the water coming out of the ice
[3:13] crystal blue beautiful blue baby blue
[3:16] color I stood there and I realized how
[3:22] far we had come up the mountain and we
[3:24] wasn't halfway up it hardly it is still
[3:27] it towered up above me big glaciers
[3:30] coming down I stood there looking at
[3:33] that majestic thing and the thought come
[3:37] to meet him
[3:38] [Music]
[3:39] it would take the rest of your life you
[3:44] probably wouldn't in a lifetime with
[3:47] your situation your ability get over
[3:50] this mountain if it were to take days
[3:53] months maybe take a whole summer for me
[3:58] trying struggling one step at a time
[4:01] cliffs that are impassable
[4:03] climbing whatever it was it was
[4:07] impossible and I looked at that great
[4:10] mountain towered over me
[4:11] and wondered at its majestic peace how
[4:15] it would look to be able to look down
[4:18] upon them just a couple of days later we
[4:24] flew out of Edmonton and as we flew we
[4:29] had to fly over Calgary down over bound
[4:32] in the boom and there I was in a
[4:36] cushioned seat and their condition
[4:41] without a struggle and the pilot comes
[4:46] on and said if you look over to your
[4:48] right you can look down over the
[4:51] mountains and back and I looked over at
[4:54] that impossible mountain that I was not
[4:58] able to climb up then it would have been
[5:01] impossible for me to ever get over it
[5:04] and there on the wings of that airplane
[5:09] i sat in comfort and look down on this
[5:13] what was a lofty peace and now it was
[5:17] just only a mohel I crossed it with ease
[5:22] because I went on the wings
[5:24] what's your need and what's your cry
[5:27] what's your mountain much too high speak
[5:31] the Word of God and bye-bye it will move
[5:34] or you will fly
[5:38] something's gonna happen to me you're
[5:40] getting over that swords the Lord to you
[5:43] tonight you're getting over to your
[5:46] riser the puppet a man that may look too
[5:48] high I made up to bang it may look
[5:50] impossible but I'm telling you tonight
[5:53] the winds of the Holy Spirit is here to
[5:56] lift Hill on eagle's wings give me that
[5:59] next verse so let's read it now hey man
[6:01] what's eagle in the sky he does not
[6:05] struggle he does not strive for the
[6:08] power that makes him rise is already in
[6:13] the sky
[6:14] amen Oh church tonight that power is
[6:18] already there for you amen let's sing
[6:20] that second third verse again now
