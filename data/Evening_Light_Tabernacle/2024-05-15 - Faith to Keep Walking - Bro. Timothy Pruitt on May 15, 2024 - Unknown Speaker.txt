ask it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you you can turn to 2 Corinthians 5 verse1 also Hebrews rews 11 and verse 5 it's good to be back with you again we just had a little time down in Florida with Adriana and and her husband Ben and the church there brother Danny also sends his greetings back and got in about 12:30 last night but glad to be be back home and be back with uh our family amen here God bless you tonight also I see brother Tim sister Angie back God bless you amen glad you're back with us made it safely hope your trip was successful amen let's just read the scripture here 2 Corinthians 5 and verse one says for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be we that be clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do grow be in burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath wrought us for the selfs same thing as God who also has given us the earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that while we are here we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord for we walk by faith and not by sight Hebrews chap 11 and verse 5 says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God for without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen God bless you be seated this evening I I I this thought has been on my heart for a little while and I actually ended up studying on it while I was away and preaching on it on Sunday at brother Danny's Church there and like to bring it to you today on faith to keep walking amen Faith to keep walking I I believe you know that's something we have to do in this hour is just to keep taken another step I don't care how long how far along the journey you've been how long you've been in the message how many degrees you got you got to keep walking can't keep walking with the Lord and I I believe that's how Enoch was he had a testimony that he pleased God and how how how did he please him because he had faith that he was going to do what he said he was going to do amen he had Faith to believe him that he is and he's the rewarder of them that diligently seek him now we know that the the devil is always that's one that's one tactic we can look back and we will at Eve a little bit and we can see that's where he brought us to the condition that we're in is because she quit walking with God she started she stopped for just a moment and that's his tactic Amen to try to make you stop for just a moment instead of walking by faith and begin to try to reason things out and try to think how it ought to be and and come up with your own ideas and and and and and true it's not really your own IDE ideas is his ideas amen because we're either uh either influenced by one or two Realms there's there's there's the the realm below or the real above amen that we're either influenced and we see the world and their free thinking and where it's taken them is taking them to a very dark place and it's not their own thinking they they might think I want to think my own thoughts I want to be my own person I want to do what I want to do but they're being influenced by another world and that world is be very prevalent amen and we can see it in flesh of human beings upon the Earth and I I get amazed that as what's coming out of hell you can see it coming out of hell because it's coming out of humans and it's coming out of out of their lives and the way they think and their hatred and and their and their and their way they speak and the way they they operate you can see exactly where it's coming from but I also believe that there's other another part to that that there's another people that that's not influenced From Below but they're influenced from above and that also is coming out of their lives and and it's coming out of what they believe and how they speak and how they talk and how they think you know a Christian always looks at the Unseen things amen every Redemptive of blessing of God every Redemptive blessing of God is unseen the armor of God love and faith and joy longsuffering goodness uh meekness gentleness patience it's all unseen forces that works in the heart of a Believer as brother Brandon would tell somebody go buy me a court of love go buy me some Joy go you can't do it it's unseen thing that's we but we look at things we do not see and and if we're children of Abraham then we don't walk by sight we walk by faith amen for Abraham walked by faith calling those things that were not as though they were because God said they were and I believe we can do the same thing in this hour that we can call at those things that are not as though they are we can call ourselves healed even though we're sick we can call oursel Delivered even though there's things that sitting there amen we're we're we're expressing what God has said in his word I I believe every child of Abraham does that they they look to the Unseen Joshua a son of Abraham you know he had no way of knowing how he was going to take the city of J Jericho and maybe Caleb had no way of knowing how he was going to take that mountain but they believed it anyhow because because God said they would he said I'm going to give you the land and I I've got an angel that'll go before you and in the journey Joshua had found at that this great God living in that Pillar of Fire that angel of God had performed all the Miracles had done everything he said he would do and here they are in the Jour in the journey into the promised land and I I've always said this I I don't believe uh uh Joshua and Caleb were walking around and when they went there with the 12 Spies looking at how big the Giants were with their measuring stick and saying wow these are 12T tall that one's 14 foot look how big this wall is look look how impossible that's not what they were looking at they were looking at what God Said and God said this was their land it may not have looked like it it may have not they may have not acted like it but God had already spoken and so they could already call that which was not as though that it were amen so they could look at his mountain and say this is where I'm going to build my house this is how I'm going to do it well what about the Giants it don't matter about the Giants God gave me that land God gave me that possession and so they would walk by faith they had seen all the Wonders they had seen all the things that he had done and God said I give it to you but you go possess it God has given every sick person in here Divine Healing amen it's in the word of God Jesus was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we are healed it's yours but you will have to fight for every inch you possess every one of us will you you'll have to fight for anything you get out of any service you're not going to be able to just sit there and it just come automatically no we're going to have to draw our swords and we're going to have to walk in faith believe in what God said he's going to perform and what God said he said he would be here Among Us so if he's here Among Us he's going to perform the word he has for us in this season so there has to be somebody amen that is looking not at what they see you may what you see may be doubts what you see may be fears what you see may be uh circumstances around you and things that have clouded up your thoughts throughout the day and hurt you in some kind of way and wants to muddle up your being but if you look beyond all of that and you'll look to the Unseen that's out there in front of us God will perform what he said he would do now if any would have just kept looking at what was around him he would have never took the body change but he kept looking what was before him Amen brother brand said if you want to be well you put a well body before you and you walk into it I believe if it would go that for a natural body how much more does it go for that for the spiritual body let's put a a change body out there in front of us and let's put that before our eyes and start walking towards it amen Footprints is possession so let's take every inch of the ground that God give us that's what he told Abraham you walk the breath of it you walk it and what you walk I will give to you if you haven't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost Peter said the promises unto you and to your children and to them that are a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call Footprints is possession so let's go get it it's ours amen Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever let's possess it the works that I do shall you do also let's possess it it's God's promise it's God's word we don't look at the circumstances we don't look how hard it is let's possess the land we have a meeting and the Holy Ghost falling in the place and people screaming and shouting praising the Lord then somebody come up and say pray for me and you lay hands on them and pray for them now and then you say now go and believe see here's what it is he said it's easy to feel the power of God to see it when you believe it but then when it comes to a show down are you able to possess the thing you profess to have it's easy to possess things amen when you're in a group and and and the spirit of the Lord is falling and you can possess happiness and you can possess Joy but what about in your bedroom what about in your car when you're all along and the devil wants to come and put thoughts in your mind he wants to torment you you can possess it right there yes all right amen Joshua fought for every inch of ground from one end of the country to the other but he had a promise from God I'll give it to you whether there's Giants whether there's atheist whether there's infidels whether there's cold former churches what differences make God give me the promise let's go take it it's ours it belongs to us it's our possession let's go get it don't be afraid don't look back and say well I don't know don't do that don't look that don't look like a child of Abraham no matter how far along the promise seemed to hold out well it went for 25 years but instead of Abraham getting weaker he got stronger all the time how many children of Abraham are here amen the promise seems to be lengthening out and going out I never dreamed we'd be in 2024 but we're not going to get weaker we're going to get stronger we're not going to believe less we're going to believe more Hallelujah that's why I believe we'll see more healing and more deliverances and more salvations why because we're not getting weaker we're getting stronger well this one is leaving and that one is leaving so did Lot leave Abraham but that didn't make him weaker that made him stronger amen got stronger all the time for you knew it'd be a greater Miracle all the time you know we'll be prayed for one night you know the next day we'll say well maybe I never got anything I need to go through that line again no you need to believe amen you need to believe oh you and he said oh you call yourself a child of Abraham he said if God made a promise God give the promise and you believe it I don't care what takes place it's yours fight the devil on every ounce of ground he stands Zone and walk over there and take it with the sword of the word amen it's time that we quit letting the devil cish back off of what God did for us amen we go to a youth camp and we get an experience or we come to a church service and we get a moment with God don't go out the next day and say it never happened or I don't know if it no you take your sword and you fight the devil no matter what's going on God promises are true nothing can stop them there God promises amen I may make a promise and may not be able to fulfill it but God cannot do that Hallelujah he gave us the promise of that just like he did the children of Israel he said the Pentecostal church has come to their Kadesh Baria are we able can we do it well if the Pentecost came to that so will the message come to that can we do it Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever can we walk up there and take a hold of God's promises and say it's truth I claim it I own it it's mine God gave it to me how you going to do it I don't know it's none of my business it's up to God it's up to me to believe amen he said like I was preaching one time on Elijah a man came to me after servant said well wait a minute preacher I believe you're a man more sane man than actually believe that some crows brought Elijah fish and bread some reason the devil gets stirred up when you start preaching about birds he gets mad about that but that's okay we don't care inside thing sorry but he said I believe every word of it he said matter of fact the fish was fried and the bread was cooked he said how do you know tell me how how that happened he said I was a Jehovah's Witness said that tell me how how do the crows get to fry some bread or fry some fish and bake some bread he said that's not for me to question it wasn't for Elijah to question the only thing he knew when he got the sandwich it was good to eat and he said the same thing about the baptism of the Holy Ghost I can't tell you where it may come from or how it gets there I but I know it comes and I enjoy it that's all I care about he said I can't tell you how Divine Healing Works neither can I tell you how a black cow can eat gr Green Grass and give white milk but I drink it anyhow I don't try to make a formula out of it I don't know what causes the Holy Ghost to fall in a meeting and people speak in tongues and prophesy cripples jump up from wheelchairs sick get healed I can't tell you all of that but one thing I know God has promised it it's our possession let's take it and go with it it's ours but that's where that's where Israel made their mistake that's where Pentecost made their mistake mistake they come to the Judgment seat and brought back the evidence of a good land Pentecost actually had in their hands the evidence of a good land talking about isus Street the whole movement that come up to to through through the through the time and they had that but what did they want they wanted their denominations they wanted their man Creeds and their dogmas all they joyed the healing they enjoyed watching all that happen but they didn't want nothing to do with that word that's right and that's exactly where every Christian comes to come on somebody got quiet all of a sudden for some reason but it's exactly where every Christian comes to we might enjoy certain aspects of the church we might enjoy being around each other and music or this that and the other and we might enjoy a few things that happen but when it comes to the word and the word brings correction what are we going to do about then it's a judgment seat he said I'm so glad that there were people years ago who approached through all the formalities and went up and possessed the land and got the evidence and come back that there's a land beyond the river I'm so glad of that they made their fatal mistake when they begin to murmur against Moses and against God's servant and against God by and it bypassed them and remember every one of them that murmured never went into the land Jesus said when he was on Earth your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness but there everyone dead and you look into that that means eternally separated from God everyone dead right I am the bread of life that came from God out of Heaven that a man can eat thereof and not die oh I like that pass from death into life become a new creature carnality cut off their spiritual Supply carnality cut off all their joy and they begin murmuring and fussing and they looked them off and it took them off in the desert if anything I hate is a desert now that's a prophet I'm sorry if anything I hate is a desert it's hot there's nobody hardly can live there everybody you get against in the desert got sticker everything's got stickers on it every kind of little old Vines got stickers on it is because there's no water there he said but if you'll bring them to where the water is it'll come out and bring a Tender Leaf amen will come into a water place he said so what's the matter with a lot of churches the reason they fuss and quarrel and stew and so-called Christians cuz they've been bypassed from the land of the blessing oh my from the fountain that never runs dry from The Rock in the weary land and they come dry and carnal they begin to murmur about this and murmur about that and mad about this and mad about that why because they're carnal that's why listen Church ain't all about you but we should all be about church amen listen it ain't all about me it ain't all about these brothers it ain't all about you individually but all of us together and God that's what it's about it's all about him that's why we gather together that's why we sacrifice and come on a Wednesday night it's not so I can be tickled and petted and and all these things and pred up and gushed no sir it's about him they had left the garlic pots of Egypt to eat Angel's food and was complaining they left the Muddy Waters of Egypt to drink from that spiritual war Rock and still complaining they left the boasting Physicians of Egypt to be with a great physician even their clothes didn't get threadbear there wasn't a feeble one among them and still complaining then they they left the people that said the days of Miracles have passed to be with the people that got signs following the Believers still complaining isn't that the same today we come out of the old cold formal stuff get the Holy Ghost and God fills you with goodness and you're drinking from the fountain that never runs dry all of them things they're joy unspeakable and full of glory and then go to complaining it's just the same thing first thing you know you're bypassed off into the desert somewhere that's the way God does things the way people today when fear strikes them when they're right in the path of Duty if you're but he said he said let listen to this he said if you're walking in the light having fellowship with God and with his people and the Holy Spirit is upon you and you meet an obstacle right in the path of Duty don't stop just keep pressing on God Will Make A Way through it that's one of the great experiences of my life is to seek God when I can't get over it under it around it or anyway God opens up a way and I go through it somehow or another his grace is always sufficient so no matter the circumstances keep walking no matter the symptoms still believe no matter how many critics rise up in what they say we have a job to do we have a mission to complete we're walking to a body change Satan does everything he can to try to make you stop for just a moment because if he knows you he has you stopped he knows you're no longer possessing cuz footsteps are possession not standing still footsteps are possession so he knows if he has you stopped you're no longer possessing so if you're not progressing in your Christian walk you're not possessing that's why we never have we never can be satisfied where we are we're pilgrims I'm strangers here on this Earth we're looking for a city not made with hands amen we're just as Abraham were wandering around looking for that place seeing what groaning inside of us listen if this world ain't making you grown there's something wrong somewhere all the stuff that's going on and the evil that's everywhere and the hatred and and they want to say we're the one that's hated or hateful please the rioting and the lawl and is scriptures being fulfilled listen every one of them are fulfilling scriptures they can they can make they can say this Bible's made up all they want to say is made up but I say it describes today pretty good amen I I tell you when you see all the things that are going going on Among Us and and the and the and the different nations and wars and rumors of war and all this stuff what is it trying to do stop you for just a moment see the devil said to Eve oh the tree is pleasant and she said it's good to look at see that same devil if he can get you to stop for just a minute he can make you reason it all out and he can make you think with your own mind but this is not what we're supposed to be thinking with we're supposed to have the mind of Christ Christ This Is What Makes Us different this is what makes us talk different act different walk different it's cuz we're not walking according to our own thoughts our own ability we're walking according to the mind of Christ but the devil wants to do you like Eve stop for a minute but he says don't you pay any attention to him keep your eyes on Christ your ears on the word and keep moving that's the fact faith that was once delivered to the Saints that's the faith that once was delivered to the Saints keep your eyes on Christ your ears on the word and keep moving don't stop it all God sinks his word in your heart just take that sword and start chopping and cutting screaming Hallelujah I ain't got time to wait on this or hear this just cross over I ain't got time to even settle down if the devil says well how you think you're feeling now don't even speak to him just keep going you said the devil say well you know what you know so and so when they got the Holy Ghost remember they almost lost their mind don't even speak to them keep going on you don't know about so and so it's you and God come on somebody it ain't you and so and so so it's time we get out of so and so's business and make it between us and God church is not about so and so it's about you and God your walk is not about so and so it's about you and God well you just ain't heard what I heard don't even speak to him no matter what the critics say you got to expect that they're fulfilling scripture direct quotes don't listen to it keep your up your just close up your ears and go on you know brother brandom got turned around very familiar story wonderful got turned around out one time hunting and you know by his own wisdom and his own knowledge he found himself on what he called an Indian death walk and he found himself just going around going around in the circle till you die everything in him wanted to just stop and maybe hold up in a place and wait out let the storm pass but if he stopped his wife and his child was going to die and so he was trying though to walk on his own abilities and he had great abilities as far as a Woodsman he'd been in it all his life he'd trapped from a little boy no doubt knew exactly how to read things and in the Moss and this that and the other and had the snow was fall everything he knew he knew but this wasn't God was teaching himself something this wasn't about his own abilities this was about Allowing God to show him the way and trust him no matter what amen he found himself in this place and he found himself you know walking and he well I'm going to go this way and I'm going to set myself and he take off and he'd come back that was the same tree again well I'm going to do I'm going to set and he walk and he same tree same tree same tree same spot same spot come on like a lot of people in their lives never can't get to Victory cuz they're coming right back around to the same place right back around the same why cuz they're trying to walk in their own thinking and their own knowledge and their own abilities and how they think they can get themselves out of the deal amen it ain't about how you can get yourself out of anything it's about what God can do and he began to hear this voice speaking and said I'm the everpresent help in the time of trouble oh oh God let that voice speak to somebody tonight that I'm the everpresent help he wasn't just a help on that mountain he's a help tonight on a Wednesday night he can come to your Pew and where you're at you might feel like you've been in the death walk it's called you've been walking on your own abilities but if you'll start listening to that voice and cast down your reasoning God will take [Applause] over and here he is walking exactly the wrong direction and all of a sudden he said I felt a little tap on my shoulder oh God yes Lord tap somebody tonight Lord and He Turned and he said all of a sudden I turned around he said when I did the fog had been pushed back and he said I got a glimpse of Hurricane Mountain and he said I was headed exactly the wrong direction he said but God rich in Mercy pulled me back around I don't know about you but I'm thankful the prophet of God shared these kind of testimonies that he could show he was also a human and he also made mistakes and he also leaned on his own ability and his own understanding but God rich in Mercy turned him around and pointed him back in the right direction if God could do that to a prophet he can do that to you tonight you might have been on the wrong path going the wrong way but there's a tap coming on your shoulder through the word of almighty God and turning you around and the fog has been blowned back oh God let the wind of the spirit blow tonight and blow the fog back and we can catch a glimpse not of Hurrican Mountain but of [Applause] Calvary and he said I knew between me and that mountain was a line I'd put up and he said I didn't know what else to do but throw up my [Music] hands there's a reason why that song got some power in it yeah so I throw up my hands and praise you again and again why you know may not feel like it he didn't feel like it either he said there was times one of his hand got so tired he just had to pull one up and put another one up but he's going to keep a hand up cuz he said if I miss that wire I miss my opportunity right why did he not stop because there were lives at stake there was somebody down in that cabin that was worth saving yeah oh my all of a sudden he said I stopped for a moment he said that's the way it is just a rest he said but I wouldn't move until I got another hand up and he said when I got that hand up that's the way you want to go to Calvary don't lose an inch don't lose an inch I kept my hand up moving God surely you'll help me find it I'm coming straight I know right across this hill this is the way you pointed me that's the way you say to the word tonight you said you're a Healer I got my hands up you said you're a deliverer I got my hands up you said you was a savior I got my hands up and he kept moving till something hit his hand first thing you know I caught something and I felt it it was a wire he said oh what a feeling I was never going to take my hand off of that wire the rest of my journey cuz I knew that wire led me right down to where my wife and child was let me tell you tonight if you can grab a hold of God tonight that God will lead you to your healing it'll lead you to your joy it'll lead you to your salvation it'll lead you to your peace it'll lead you to everything you have need of this God is Not Just Enough he's more than [Applause] enough Hallelujah tonight Jesus Christ is a very present help in the time of trouble if that you're sick and the doctors can't do no more for you raise up your hands look up to God until you touch the little live electric wire you under that says it's finished Hallelujah no matter how many unbelievers doubters churches everything else you have to bypass hold on to it for he's the one that leads you to your deliverance God bless you keep your hands up keep moving amen hold your hands till you catch the wire hold your hands of Faith up till you feel something touched that says it's finished you've got his word he said he would lead you to victory by faith you can be healed anyone believes can be healed hold your hands up till you feel Faith Of God pouring in you and then follow that the Lord is a strength and refuge our res very present help in the time of trouble we have scripture to fulfill someone is going to believe the word and nothing else someone is going to take a body change someone is not going to listen to what a what not one word the devil has to say someone is going to tune him out and say look you stopped Eve in the beginning but you'll not stop this eve she's going to go on to her body change you stopped her and brought destruction but you'll not stop this one and she'll bring back life Jesus had critics but he had Faith to keep walking why cuz there were lives at stake oh I want that to sink deep he had to fulfill the word spoken of him so you will also have to fulfill the word spoken of you as he was walking toward Calvary some of them begin to scream out we challenge you we dare you to perform a miracle we want to see it done we want to see it with our own eyes see spirits never die you rais the dead we got a whole Cemetery full hahaa come up here and raise them come here and raise them you destroy you said you destroy the temple and raise it up through look hey Miracle Man my uncle John down here he' been crippled for 5 years fell off his horse hurt himself come down and heal him and we will believe you no they wouldn't those who could see though there was one who kept a steady look towards heaven walking on he didn't even hear it he was too big to hear it that's right big men don't notice nonsense like that they just ignore it they know the resource from where it comes Mercy Jesus I thought these were men no these were Spirits crying out in men and it's exactly the same thing we see in today amen they they just ignore it they know the resource which it comes from they go on Jesus had one thing to do he had one job to do and that was to do the will of the father that was always in his heart and in his mind and any other man that's anointed of God is too big to listen to criticisms and things like that they don't they have one job to do that's obey God God will take care of the rest just watch what happens to that type of crowd what if we could rise out of Rise them out of hell tonight what would they do he said I imagine we'd be an oldfashioned alter call sure enough but they can't their attitude towards the Son of God sealed their destination and your attitude towards him tonight will do the same thing for you he either bring him in or seal him out wow but watch him he marched he walked on the whole world every sin that was committed from Adam to the last mortal that live on earth laid on his his shoulders but he wouldn't stop why cuz there were lives at stake if he stopped you wouldn't have a chance that's right if he said I can't do it you would be without hope I would be without hope there's lives that stake what's Jesus doing he's got his eyes set to Calvary he's going right straight to Jerusalem to be offered up for a sacrifice the weight of every sin that was ever committed on Earth or ever would be committed rested upon his precious shoulders shoulders he was a big man when people say bad things about you if you can just go on and forget it that shows you are a big man little men can't tamper with it that he was too big to listen to their criticism he had one thing to do that's the father's will he had to die for those men yes so he kept his face toward Calvary and kept walking see fa Faith it's I'm about to read one of my favorite quotes and I've used it before but I'm going to use it again faith is unconscious you got faith sometimes and don't even know it Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm or a gale knocking the boat one side or the other he standing in the fa face of a mess of demons if he was hanging anywhere and never moved he walked right on just as calm and quiet as he could be he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him whether it was going to happen whether it's not going to happen he knew it was going to happen because God said it was going to happen he didn't say I wonder if I prayed through wonder if I fasted long enough wonder if I did this he walked right on unconscious he believed what God Said was the truth the words must be fulfilled and he knew what his life was sent to to do to fulfill them and you are here to fulfill it too and you are here to fulfill it too so just walk unconscious to fear walk unconscious to fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious to the world what do you mean unconscious in other words you're so out of tune with what they're saying and what they're doing you never heard them don't look like don't look at me like you don't do that you do do that put a phone in your face you be we become unconscious to all kinds of things the house could be blown away daddy the house is on fire we don't hear things why we're unconscious to it cuz we're zoned into something come on somebody and I'm not saying what you're looking at it's all together bad I hope it ain't amen but but what is it if you'll get zoned into what we're here to fulfill if you'll get so tuned into what we're here to do and why we're here on this Earth we're not here to just have a church and have a few good songs and a couple of sermons here and there live a life and die no sir we are here for a body change we are here to see the dead in Christ rise we are here to see God move in the most miraculous way he's ever moved since the beginning of earth when dead will rise again and become flesh and the immortal immort immortality will take on immortality and gray hair will come back to a normal color again and broken bones and withered up hands and withered up legs and withered up feet will all be perfect again and there won't be no mind battles there won't be nothing left of the devil no more it'll be all over and happiness and pure and goodness of God flowing everywhere that is where we're about to step into so if we got all that in front of us why we worried about a little critic why we worried about some nonsense the devil got to say to him out and listen to what God has walk unconscious to criticism walk unconscious to the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right or the left just moving on if something comes to the church up in the church walk with god well I need to know who's right and wrong walk with God Amen if sign strikes you walk with God if neighbors don't like you walk with God turn to your neighbor and say I'm walking with God Amen just keep on hope your neighbor likes you keep on walking any one day walk like that you know what he done he walked all the way home with God got so far up the road he didn't want to come back no more woo Jesus walk with God doctor says you're going to die walk with God doctor says you can't live walk with God just walk with God that's all God has promised you I'll never leave you or forsake you I'll be with you walk with God sure you'll have up and downs don't worry you'll go through Bri patches sharp rocks Bluffs down over hillsides up mountains over Waters but walk with God there's so many Hills to climb upward we heard the old song but how little it'll seem when we get to the end of the way oh Jesus just look at it there all the been look back at your Footprints it won't be very much then Jesus what that going to be like we get there and we look back everyone of us no matter how bad our life has been it's going to say that wasn't much to go through to get this sometimes you got to go through a lot athletes got to go go through a lot to win a prize and it's just a piece of metal or trophy they put in a case somewhere they beat their bodies and they do all kinds of things and they Paul said they win an in an Incorruptible Crown today they they used to run great races thousands of years ago and you can't find hardly a remnant of of their crowns if you can but we're not in this race to win a corruptible crown but an Incorruptible that one day you're going to be taking a step and that theophany is going to come it's going to come and join up with this body and we'll be like that glorious body and we'll look back that wasn't much that wasn't much not to what I got now it was worth it there's some people may have wanted prize and realize man all the suffering and stuff I went through this this is big whoop that ain't the way that's going to be not when you step into that body eyes have not seen ears have not heard the glory that will be revealed in US mercy so yeah we'll go through bride practice sharp Rocks Church troubles things all kind of stuff but walk with God see that when Jesus was going through this carrying this cross bearing The Shame of the world he never even raised his head he just kept walking he said that's what makes me love him you know it takes a little bitty Petty person to fuss and argue a big man never pays any attention to nothing like that Christian doesn't notice what the world says if they want to say anything they want to they say anything they want to they're just but they're too big to notice those little bitty things they keep moving on Jesus with his head back walk back scream pre screaming at him making fun others crying Hosanna but did you notice the whole burden of the world rested upon Him Calvary the dark hours of Gethsemane lay before him and he went he never noticed or scoffing you know when somebody says something evil about you and you want to take it up and get angry about it that shows you ain't get went quite deep enough yet with God direct quote let me see where that was at blind bmus 57301 57 Phoenix Arizona if someone says something evil about you and you want to take it up and get angry about it that shows you haven't went quite deep enough with God yet but men don't do those things big men don't do those things that's what made him God to me he was big enough he didn't even notice their little scoffing he had a purpose he had a work to do that was to fulfill what God had sent him to do and he was determined to do it he didn't care what anybody said about it he said I say this with all respect I've been offered great positions in churches I forget if I'd forget about Divine Healing and have a good salary and a fine home but God sent me to pray for his sick children and it makes no difference what anybody says I've got a commission to do and they can say holy rly they can do whatever they wish I got a commission to do and everyone that's born of the spirit of God has got a commission to do it don't make any difference what the world say you don't notice their scoff that's right amen it was a time you can read it's a real short I don't know if you call it a message called testimony very powerful brother Brown tells mainly about being around the Jonesboro meetings and being there eight days and nights sleeping at the pool pit praying day and night and day and night getting a little rest getting back up and praying people standing there in the rain why were they doing that because lives were at stake they just kept taking another step kept taking another step to finally maybe they had the opportunity to step right there before him what if they' gave up just around the corner what if they had just quit and went home but this is where he was at and he's gets called he's he took a little break for a moment he seen someone Mo motion him with a uniform on his ambulance driver and he said I got a patient out here's dying can you come see her just the night before a man that had a shoe cober up in the city of Arkansas had been blind for 20 years when he passed to the line the Holy Spirit told him about his conditions and pronounced him healed well he left the building blind left the building he could not see any more than he did when he came in the building but he knew I did not know him and there was some sort of Supernatural being speak it because he knew I know nothing of him and he accepted that person not me the one that was speaking the story was they threw it on the radio the next morning across the country that on this on his road home that night about 2:00 in the morning he be to see the lights of the cars flickering in front of him next morning he rushed into his own church the Methodist Church and he caused such a disturbance till he was throwed out then down the street he went from one Church to another to testify it caused quite a commotion many of the people would come from the hospitals and we're waiting to be prayed for and we walked out followed this ambulance driver out and he said it was into an ambulance it was a typical Arkansa mother laying there dying with cancer and her husband thought maybe that she was dead look maybe I don't know maybe she was in a com Comer he didn't know exactly she was laying quietly knelt down the back of the Hamet with the driver put me and brother he said brother bradam she long so much for you to pray for her she's a good woman she's there to help me farm and mother of five children have sold my farm and last thing we sold was our team and the doctors have fought Faithfully to save her life but she was given up and sent home and to get an amulet to bring us down she sold her blackberries we'd canned two years ago to get money to come and now she's been laying quiet she's dead and I took a hold of her hand she knelt down in his old in his old patched shirt faded out and I prayed just a little prayer and I thought i' seen the wrinkles of her forehead kindly frown and Satan said to me of course of course you know that's just a reaction of the muscles she's dead but I continued to pray her hand gripped mine like that and Satan said it's just the muscles and I continued to pray in a few moments she raised up and she said who are you and her whole husband so overcome by bringing life again to his sweet wife threw his arms around and began to scream mama I slipped out the door of the Hamlet I said can you get me back to the platform he said there's 2,000 people between here and that door I'll take you around the back of the parking lot and see if I can make a way that way they go around a different way and he said all that was just to show that God will respect those who hunger and thirst for righteousness he said when we got to where the line of the chartered buses was I heard a noise and I looked it was a young colored girl nicely dressed in AR in Arkansas in those days it was strict segregation and she was F and she was trying to find her way around and she was calling out Papa where are you papa feeling a harm but she just kept walking Papa where are you want to help somebody help me find my papa but she just kept walking crying out he said I just went over there and stood for a moment no one knew me cuz I I've been in that place all the time the temple there and they couldn't even get in there so nobody knew who I was somebody please help me find my papa and she just kept moving through the crowd stumbling through and I thought of old blind Anna in the Temple when she had prayed so long and waited for the consolation of Israel and they brought our Lord into the temple to do for him the custom of the law and the Holy Spirit Led that blind woman to where he was so I stood there for a moment and she finally staggered right into me and she said pardon me and she started to go again I said who are you looking for young lady she said sir I'm looking for my papa we've come from Memphis to see the Healer my papa was trying to F find a way into the building and I've lost him I got pushed out of the place where he told me to be and I can't find him and I I if you'll just help me to the bus where I can find my papa and seem like being a hypocrite maybe but I said who do you say you come to see should I come over to see the Healer you see sir I've been blind for years but I heard on the radio this morning of a man who got his sight and papa got the money together and we ched a bus and came over to see him and now they
