you'll come and speak Lord and you'll open the bread of life Lord God and you allow people to recognize who they are where we are Lord Jesus Lord of your people Lord God could just be lifted up tonight to to grab a hold of another another portion of faith Lord to be elevated in the promise well that's what we want tonight we want you to speak to the people Lord that's the only way that can happen is if you'll come take control but I submit myself to you submit this service to you we thank you for the worship Lord that's gone forth I pray that it was pleasing in your eyes Lord not just pray you'll come now take control in Jesus name Amen amen if you'll turn with me to Deuteronomy the eighth chapter we'll look in the seventh verse and then we'll also look at we're in 2nd Samuel the 23rd chapter after we read here I want to speak to you tonight for a little while on the subject of deliver the barley deliver the barley I our thing tonight is that we want to recognize that that Satan's job is to rob you Satan's job is to keep you from attaining all that belongs to you and the thing is he doesn't come in and say oh look at me I'm the devil and go after all the big things right off the bat what Satan does is he comes in and he begins to nibble and he comes in slyly in ways that we never expect but if we can recognize him in those moments and we can deal with him in those moments when it's still a little thing then we can have much greater victory in our life instead of allowing it to grow into it to a major issue something that's deep rooted in our heart our deep rooted in our home and then it becomes a much bigger issue for us to deal with so tonight we want to recognize the devil recognize his tricks recognize his lies and always remember that the promises of God are yay and amen verse 7 it says for the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land a land of Brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of the valleys and Hills a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and promote pomegranates a land of olive oil and honey a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scare sness thou shalt not lack anything in it a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass when thou has eaten and art full then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given there we'll turn over now to 2nd Samuel the 23rd chapter in the eighth verse and in verse 8 it says these be the names of the mighty men whom David had the tech my night that said in the seat chief among the captains the same was with adeno that is right he lifts up his spear against eight hundred whom he slew at one time and after him was le easier the son of dodo via Hawaii one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle and the men of Israel were gone away he arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clayvin to the sword and the Lord wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil may the Lord bless the reading of the word you may have your seats what a wonderful description we read there in the book of Deuteronomy of the land that the Israelites had been taken to is a land full of the goodness of God a land that that was full of wheat a land that was full of barley a land that had vines and plenty of bread and running water and Springs and it was a land that lacked nothing I believe tonight that we can say that we've been brought to a land and it's and it's a good land and and it says you shall lack nothing in this land and the Lord had brought them up out of Egypt and he'd brought them up with the mighty hand and in so doing he had showed the miraculous he had showed signs and wonders he had showed that there was no other God that could stand before this God he had showed that there was no situation that could stand in front of him there was no army that could stand in front of him when God makes up his mind he's going to do something the work is finished it doesn't matter what the devil tries to do it doesn't matter what he throws in your way if you'll stay with the Lord you're gonna overcome and there was no army that could stand there and as long as Israel would stay with the Lord they could say who can stand before us it wasn't just who can stand before our God because as long as they were walking with Him then they could say who can stand before us because he was walking with them and I believe that tonight we can ask that same question who can stand before our God can cancer stand before our God can depression stand before our God what about anxiety can it stand before our God we can say that even in this congregation we've seen all those things defeated we would be here all night if we all had the opportunity to testify about the times that God has overcome has defeated the enemy has lifted us up when we were down as this joy when we were depressed who has healed our body when we were sick there is nothing that can stand before our God and as long as we were walking with the word we're walking in the promise we therefore can say tonight what can stand before us as even in light tabernacle as members of the bride of Jesus Christ what can stand before said God be for us who can be against us tonight amen all these things have been defeated therefore we know that that that we are on the path to receiving all that God has promised for us now Israel had seen the miraculous hand of God delivered them and take them to the promised land and it was a physical land it was a physical place that they had been promised and as the scripture said there it had wheat and barley and figs and honey and it was a good land but we also have been returned to a land that's the land of the Holy Ghost and here in this land is full of living waters here in this land is full of powers full of healing is full of salvation this land tonight is full of deliverance is full of everything that you have need of tonight but you got to stay in the land there's deliverance for you there's peace for you it is a good land but I also want to tell you tonight that in the land there's war in this land there is conflict when Israel came into the land the first time you know God didn't come down and just remove all the Hittites and the jebusites and all the other rights and go ok I've cleaned them all out for you now now you go in and possess all they had but what they had to do is they had to go in and fight for every single inch of the land they had to go in and they had to battle and they had to battle constantly and then you come down into modern times after World War two and after the Holocaust and they were brought back to the land once again and they have had to fight every single day for their very existence they have had to guard their borders against attack they have to watch out as the Arab world has sworn to destroy them and they have to constantly be on the lookout for missile attacks and car bombs and suicide bombers it's a constant battle for them to stay in the land the the world politicians have turned against them and there's no one standing left standing there with them anymore except some Christians and some people in America I would say that if we got right down to it even America has turned away from them and not support them the way that we once did but they in their situation in their country they cannot allow the enemy to have even one little bitty bit of ground they can't allow even a small attack it doesn't have to be a large attack it doesn't have to be a full-on scale war they cannot allow him any entry into their land if they recognize any little attack they immediately go they go on the offensive and they end that attack as quick as they possibly can because if if it's in their land even one foot they are determined we're going to keep the enemy out of our promised land so they are a people of the land and now they must fight to stay in the land to keep the enemy off their land and to keep the enemy from taking what is theirs and I say that tonight we are in a good land but we stand in the exact same place that the Israelites stand we must have our guard up at all times we cannot give even a little bit of ground we cannot lay down our weapons even for a minute because the enemy is always looking for a way in the enemy is always looking for a way to attack you must stay on guard and not give up even an inch even a little parcel of ground no matter how insignificant that parcel of ground may seem this is a land filled with promises but you're going to have to fight for it every single day brother branham would say and now after you're in that don't mean that you're out free from war you still have to fight for every inch of ground that you stand on brother footprints his possession ministering brother don't be afraid to put footprints where God has told you to go his possession he told Joshua everywhere the soles of your feet scent that's yours we don't back up we don't take what God said and that's we take what God said that's the truth no matter what the opposition says how great it seems how difficult it seems if God said so it's yours tonight when he gave it to Joshua he never said I'll take all the Hittites and Philistines and give it to you Joshua had to fight every inch of ground but God was with him and every inch of ground you'll cover brother to make footprints you'll fight your way through but take the sword of the Spirit brother and move right on I love how it doesn't just tell you to go fight but he equips you for the battle he doesn't just tell you to go kick him out but he gives you the tools necessary in order for you to go do it he says take the sword of the Spirit and go forward brother Brown says here oh my I like that the believers promise you say what's that got to do with us to every believer the believers promises eternal life the believers promises life joy peace long-suffering gentleness patience fruits of the spirit divine healing dozens of things I got wrote down here nearly that's all your possession it belongs to you but you can't have it until you fight for it I'll tell you the word we've been given is a good word it's full of everything you have need of to overcome and Laodicea it's got everything you have needed to take a rapture in this last day but you're gonna have to be willing to fight for it but if you fight you will overcome that is your promise tonight brother Branham says that's what's the matter with the church tonight we got a wishbone instead of a backbone what we need is something in there that'll stand you up amen every man that ever amounted to a hill of beans had to fight for what he got God don't give it to you on a silver platter God doesn't give it to you on a silver platter but I believe tonight that this land that this word that we be given is worth fighting for I believe what we've been given is worth standing up for it's worth giving our life for it's worth standing and when no one else will stand when all everyone else runs away when people are letting down standards I believe this word is worth fighting for I believe there's things in there that you can't get anywhere else we'll fight for so many other things and we'll stand up for so many other things but what about the word that's being trampled in this day somebody's going to be a beacon somebody's going to be a lighthouse and say this is the truth we're standing on we're not going to go this way or that way with new doctrines and new ideas we're going to say exactly what the Prophet said because that's what we need to take a rapture this word is worth fighting for and sometimes it may not just be fighting against worldly ideas it may be fighting against ideas that rise up in the message but I'm willing to stand tonight and fight for the truth and fight for the Holy Spirit still being in our services fight for the Holy Spirit for our young people fight for the Holy Spirit in our homes it's worth fighting for tonight because it's life without it as nothing but death but with the Holy Spirit there's life and it's worth fighting for tonight it's a good land and we must have the same resolve that we see in Israel they're determined that there will never be another Holocaust never again will they stand by and watch the enemy come in and take their land take their lives and we must stand right there where they stand and say never again will we stand by and watch our promises be taken never again will we stand by watch our children be drug out into the world never again will we stand by while our homes are broken up and destroyed never again will we sit by and let people tell us that that was for a bygone day in a bygone era but this is for this day this is for this heir the Holy Spirit is for right now that healing of the body is for right now the Pentecostal promise the Pentecostal blessing is for right now it's not for a day gone by it's for this day because we've been turned back to that day once again it's worth fighting for tonight Church but it's going to take men and women with backbone who are willing to fight men who will say this will not happen on my watch men who will say truth will be preached righteousness will be upheld holiness will be exalted Healing will be proclaimed we will not sit by idly and let the devil in not on our watch it's going to be a fight as long as we're here on this earth in these bodies Satan's desires to rob you of everything that Christ has given you and he's gonna fight you until the day that you leave here he's he's constantly looking for a way to get into your life he studied mankind he has studied you it's been said before he knows us better than we know ourselves he knows our every weakness that's why when we recognize a weakness in our life we must keep it covered we must keep those things under the blood he's always studying ways to get inside the borders of your promise to attack you in a nun fortified position or to catch you out from behind the word like he did Eve or to catch you in a situation a neglectful time like he did the disciples when they left out on the boat and they left Jesus behind and he he saw his opportunity to take the life of the disciples because they went out and did something without Jesus they went out on their own without Jesus in their boat and the reason he's doing all this is he's looking for his opportunity to destroy you sometimes I think we don't recognize how evil the devil is because we think maybe he's just trying to take this from me and he's trying to take that from me what you have to understand is those are all just little pieces that he's trying to take his end goal was to destroy you to utterly tear you down to bring you down to the depths of despair he hates you he is not your friend there's no reason to bargain with the enemy there's no reason to make treaties with the enemy he has no desire to be your friend his one goal is to destroy you and to make sure you don't go in a rapture but I got bad news for the old devil tonight I've already read the back of the book and we win I got bad news for the devil tonight there's already been a word proclaimed over youth there's already been a prophecy poured out over you there's already been an anointing oil poured out over youth Goliath pin I killed you you've already been anointed you're already been seen in the vision going in a rapture he can't not destroy you all we have to do is stand on the promise stand on the word and trust in it and not back up not give in but take the sword of the Spirit and go forward tonight it's all laying in the land for you if you'll go and possess it this is why we must put on the whole armor of God because he's always looking for any little crack in our armor and we must give him no place I'm going to say that a lot tonight we must give him no place no opportunity with no opportunities to run around or work in our lives and too many times we ourselves are to blame for the situations that we're dealing with why do you say that because we let him stay on our land when we didn't have to what we have to recognize tonight is is that it's our job it's our responsibility to take the word of the Lord you can't just sit back and and say well the Lord's gonna take care of that for me know the Lord has placed it in your hands he's given you a job to do he's given you the responsibility to take the word of the Lord and drive the enemy off every one of your promises drive the enemy off your land but too many times we sit back and we allow him free rein in our promises that he has absolutely no rights to we give him a place to stand and he doesn't belong in our land because there was a time where he had those rights because of the the fall of Adams race but what we know is that at Calvary all that Adam lost Jesus Christ restored to you every redemptive blessing that was ever given is now given back to you because of what Jesus Christ did at Calvary Satan has no rights to your land he has no rights to your health he has no rights to your family he has no right to your joy he has no rights to anything that God has given you too many times we let him Bluff up us this is how we stand up in his face and say get off my land get off my property take your depression take your anxiety take lines spirits and get out of here and do it with the word of the Lord sometimes we need to stand up and remind him that he doesn't even have the keys to his own house they were stripped from him by Jesus Christ much less does he have the right to come into my home tear up my home and do things in my house he doesn't even have the authority to go in his own house Jesus took the keys from him so many times the things that we're going through is because we've allowed him when he has no rights whatsoever ever right he ever had was stripped from him by our Lord Jesus and given to you therefore he has no right in your land it doesn't matter where he is what part of the land even if he's just on the outskirts see that's the thing is sometimes we look at him we go well that this really isn't bothering me much and he says he's over there he's over there but if he's on your land he's trespassing I don't care what part of your land is owned he doesn't have a right to be there and the problem is the longer you allow him to stay there the next day he'll move a little closer and the next day he'll move a little closer until you wake up one day and he's way too close for comfort now you've got real problems on your hand when you could have dealt with him when he first stepped on your property way over there why let him get close to our home why let him come in and bring danger to your family why bring him into your living room and bring danger to your children why let those things get close when you have the right and the opportunity and the authority the minute you seen begin to creep in say take your lying self and get off my property you have the right to call the authority the Holy Spirit on him and he will arrest him and take him out because he cannot stay if you will tell him to go don't dismiss the issue and that like nothing's happening don't wait till he's in your house don't wait until he's too close for you to do anything about it it would do wonders tonight for your children if they could see daddy rise up and do battle with the devil it would do wonders tonight for your marriage if your spouse could see you go to war for that you made it would do wonders for your home if they could see you raise up and be a leader in the home like you're supposed to be and have a backbone and stand up against some of those things that's been trying to come into your home stand up against the make up stand up against the tight clothes it would do wonders for them to see their daddy from once get down on his knees and restore the family altar and begin to invite the Holy Spirit back in it would do wonders for the experience in your home to see you stand up against the Goliath and slay him instead of letting that thing rule over you it's kind of hard to tell your children how they need to live how they need to overcome God send a prophet you're walking around beat down defeated every day with the Goliath and they're boasting and telling you what you are gonna do it ain't gonna do Rod's up one time gentler Kalani has no rights over you tell Goliath he was born for one reason that was for you to kill Goliath was born for one reason and that was to die Goliath was born to die like a lot for many of you was born for one reason for you to take his head off that would do wonders for your family to see the parents raise up and take the position they're supposed to be in brother Brown says brother I'm telling it sent the rock to the killing place and down went Goliath you know what happened then the Israelites took courage in a way they went they cut Philistines plumb to the walls it just takes one person that's got enough courage to step out and say it's right God said so now listen to this brother you down a Goliath and your whole family will go to cut and Phyllis things the first thing you know you kill look alive tonight and watch what happens in your family you kill look alive tomorrow and watch what happens with your family it's gonna be a bloody mess because they're gonna go to cutting Philistines here and cut Philistine cleaning out clothes is here cleaning out cosmetics there cleaning out bad news at bad movies bad video games they'll be out cleaning out that happens if you take care of the glass that are in your life it starts with the head of the home too many things are in the home because we won't deal with it when it's little what we have to do is quit deciding that some things are a big deal and that some things aren't a big deal let's simplify if this is in the word good or bad it's a big deal okay if it's in the word you know the Lord didn't go you know what I need something else on this page that's only half a page I got it I got to fill it up with something one of you angels come here will you fill this page yet that's not how it work it fits in the word whether it's for your good or it's something about the devil that's not it's a big deal so we got to quit looking at things and going where oh I mean it's okay my kid that's not that big a deal don't say it's not a big deal if the Lord it in his word it's a big deal if he cares about the way we should dress then that so that's a big deal that's something we should pay attention to if he says you know that women should have long hair that's a big deal in women should and men should have short hair that's a big deal he wouldn't have put it in the word if he says that you have must be born again listen to me that's a big deal it's not just I believe the message I believe the message no sir you've got to have an experience with the Living God he said you must be born again it's a big deal you must have an experience with God if it's in the word it's a big deal you know there's an old saying that says well you need to choose your battles not with the devil no no we don't pick and choose our about you know what I don't want to fight this battle because that's gonna stir up the home and she's gonna get really mad at me so this is just a little thing so I'm gonna let that go no that's not how it works when it comes to Satan and him setting the foot on my property him setting the foot on my promise him sitting the foot anywhere inside my land anywhere near my family anywhere near my children I'm not gonna pick and choose my battles if he steps on my promise we're going to if he steps on my promise we're fencing to have a fight right then right there and I can already tell you who's gonna win I can already tell you who's going to overcome I am because I'm walking with the Lord Jesus Christ and if our God is for us who can stand against us I know that when I go to war with with the enemy I'm going to come out victorious because I have a promise I've been given a book full of promises and every single one of them are the truth he can't rob me out of any of them unless I let him you say but it's just a little thing and really it's not bothering me it stays out there on the edge of my promise Song of Solomon tells us it's the little foxes that spoil the vine see that's the problem with with little foxes is they kind of seem harmless matter of fact they're pretty stinking cute they look like something that you'd like yet you better hope you don't come here they look cute they look like something that would never hurt you you say well I don't see where this is bothering me so that's the problem that's the thing with little foxes you usually don't see them because they're sneaky usually don't see them because they're full of stealth usually don't see them because they can walk without making a sound you don't see them you don't see them coming you don't hear him coming all you know is as you wake up one day and you say what happened to my blessing what happened to my harvest what happened to my children what happened to my relationship with the Lord why my lukewarm did you deal with the little foxes did you deal with the little things that crept up in your life did you deal with that temper did you deal with that bitterness the thing that you thought was no big deal and it really wasn't wasn't hindering you did you deal with that unforgiveness that you never would let go of and you wake up one day and you go what happened to the rapture I thought there was supposed to be a body change well there was but little foxes came and they and they they ruined your vine and they stole your harvest they stole your blessings because you didn't deal with them when you had the opportunity to little things matter listen you don't think little things matter get a kidney stone get a kidney stone one time little things matter all right look at that and that's in the physical all right how much damage can a so-called little thing doing the spiritual to an individual to a family to evening like Tabernacle to the to the church body worldwide those things tend to spread like cancers when we don't deal with them they tend to spread from this family to that family to this church to that church and it turns into a little cancer that's eating away at people's victory eat the way at people's joy killing people's influence now they don't want to hear nothing that comes from this preacher that preacher and it's all because of this it's a little thing that didn't get dealt with there's not a one of us here that would sign up for a kidney stone there's not a one of us here that if we had the choice we could not a one of us so why are we allowing these little complexes and things to come in and we see it and we recognize what it is and we have the opportunity to defeat it but we sit there and we let that little Complex come on us let that little complex isn't going to stay a little complex for long that fear that comes up and it's just a little bit of anxiety and instead of standing there and cast in that thing away we let it come on us that little anxiety is not going to stay a little anxiety for long but it's not like a kidney stone where sometimes we don't have a choice in this situation we have a choice we have a say in the matter when that thing rises up in our life we have a choice to sit there and say I am a son of the Living God I'm a daughter of the Living God I'm the purchase of the price I was bought with the blood I will not accept this anxiety I will not accept this complex I will not accept this fear my name is not anxiety my name is not depression my name is not complex my name is overcomer my name is miss Jesus Christ name is I'm gonna take a rapture my name is Christian I have a right to every promise in the book I'm not gonna allow some evil name or evil spirit to attach itself to me and identify me with it I'm not gonna be identified with that we heard Sunday that we were given a new name my name is victorious I'm not going to be defeated by something I'm gonna tell it where it can go why can go there because I have a promise I'm a son of the Living God and I'm gonna cast it away from me I'm not gonna accept those little things because remember it's just wanting to destroy you that's what it's all about you are Miss Jesus Christ you don't have to accept those things you have the power and authority given to you by the bridegroom and the devil loves to come and put complexes on people one of the ones he really loves to throw at people's inferiority complexes make them feel like they're not good enough make them feel like they're not worthy make them feel like they're insignificant well join the club none of us are worthy no none of us are significant without Jesus Christ and what he did for us there's none of us even worth talking about there's none of us can do anything there's none of us I can just pull ourselves up by our own bootstraps and say well I'm going to overcome I'm going to go on a rapture we're all in the same boat none of us are just more worthy than another one but he loves to come and make people feel unworthy and and in it at the truth that matter is it's all the grace of God none of us will be where we are without the grace of God and and what he wants to do is he wants to give you this complex to keep you from giving what you have to the Lord because you don't feel like it's good enough you don't feel like it's even anything to give him you don't feel like well why would he even want this what can he do with this and he wants you to think that your gift isn't valuable so you keep it to yourself or he wants you to think that your life is unworthy so you never surrender it to him for his use and young people sometimes they deal with it more than anybody they can be plagued with all sorts of feelings of crippling insecurities and you know I'm not cool I don't fit in I don't have very many friends I don't have any gifts I'm all alone and what he is doing is he's robbing you of the vision that Jesus Christ has of you he's making you value things based off the way the world values things and taking your eyes off of the way Jesus values things you don't value things the way the world values things he don't look at little gifts and small gifts and and this promise is kind of a big promise and that's a small promise and this kid's cool in this kids know you're all beautifully and wonderfully made every single one of you are and if you have any gift from God it's a great gift there's no portion of God that's not great in one portion of God that's so much greater than another you've all been beautifully and wonderfully made and you've all been sitting here with the purpose and the devil wants to come and try to rob you of that purpose by making you value yourself based off of worldly values but value yourself based off of the way social media values things or the way Hollywood values things those things aren't reality now in reality I need you in reality I can't make it without you in reality you're just as important as anybody sitting up here in reality without y'all sitting out there this would be a pretty terrible service okay your is important to this service as anybody else is you're important to the bride as anybody else is you have a part to play just like anybody else does and I can't go to you get ready so I'm pulling for you I want you to know I'm on your side I want you to know that the devil can't hold you I want you to know tonight that God loved you so much then he came out and he took on flesh and he died for you how's that the next time the devil says you're not very really the king of kings and the Lord of lords important enough to come down and shed his blood for you that's pretty important but the world tries to change our sense of value of what is really worth something of what is really worth fighting for I say tonight if it's in the word we should value it I say tonight if they're part of the family of God we should value them I say if it's in the word it's worth fighting for it's our land it's where we've been returned to and we cannot let anybody or anything come in and rob any portion of it from us and tell us it's not for us it is for us it is for you it's for all of us many of the great leaders that's we actually find in the Bible watch they dealt with complexes we found that Moses he couldn't he couldn't speak and he stuttered and he made all kind of excuses of why he couldn't go down it was because of complexes Gideon had complexes you see in judges 6:15 and he said unto Him o my lord wherewith shall I save Israel behold my family is poor see that poor rich thing that's gone on since the beginning of time my family is poor in Manasseh and I am the least in my father's house not only is my family poor he's saying but I'm the worst of all of them I'm the lowest in a poor family listen God's not interested in who you are what family you came from what your mom and daddy did he's not interested in your worldly standing or your wealth or even your rank in your own family God's not even interested in what you can do God's interested tonight and what God can do through you if you will just surrender yourself and as I've heard it said before just be available be available say Lord I'm here I don't sometimes you may not even know what it is you have to offer you may not even know what it is you have to give but if you'll just step back and say Lord I'm available use me how you see fit let me say something to someone to encourage them today let me do something to encourage somebody along their way let me do whatever it is you want me to do Lord he will use you all he needs is a vessel all he needs is a willing vessel judges 6:16 says in the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee see there's the answer right there it never it wasn't about Gideon it never was about Gideon it was about I will be with thee it was going to be the lord's victory anyway it was gonna be his victory all alone that's why when Gideon had this giant army he said no send them away send them away to it all the way all the way down to 300 that way they in no way could claim the victory but they would have to give credit to where it came from this is the Lord's victory this is the Lord's doing and when any of us get to the point that we think we're doing anything on our own we're about to fall flat on our face anytime we get to the point that we think we're something we're in trouble it's actually good sometimes when we sit back and we say Lord I don't know what I can do because those are the people that he'll use he uses common people he uses people that don't think too highly of themselves because then he can come in and he can use them the way he sees fit look at the profit of this day look at the man chosen in this day to fulfill Malachi 4:5 it wasn't some high and lifted up theologian it was a man brother branham would say I come from bootleggers my family is no good no religion he says I don't even know how he saved me and yet that was the man he chose to use so when the complexes begin to come in we got to push those things out and recognize who we truly are we are sons and daughters of the Living God we are the bride of Jesus Christ that's something we can be proud about I may not can be proud of anything else in my life but I can throw my shoulders back and lift my head up and say Jesus Christ died for me Jesus Christ loves me Jesus Christ has given me the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ went to prepare a place for me and that's something that we can be proud about it's about somebody being available listen it's not just little things that the devil wants to come in and put in your life to to destroy you what he also wants to do is slip in and Rob you and make you look at the blessings of God as little things he wants you to look at them as small things or look at your gifts or things he's bestowed upon you as little things and he tries to make you value your gifts and the things of God is being too little it's funny how he works he'll get you to look at the things the enemy is bringing in and go well that's no big deal and use it to destroy you and then he'll get you to look at something that God's given and make you say that's no big deal and then you miss an opportunity to be a blessing he robs you of the opportunity that was given to you he keeps you from seeing the value in it look it must have been a normal day that day when the little boy headed to school with five loaves and two fish mom probably got up packed his lunch gave it to him said now you'd be a good boy at school today a little did she know he wasn't being a good boy brother branham said he played hooky Brown said he said I'm going fishing I don't blame him he said I'm going fishing but something happened on his way down to the river he was going past the mountain and something caught his ear something caught his attention aren't you glad something's caught your attention something caught his attention and he came over and he began to listen for a little bit and he began to hear a man speaking and the longer he stood there the more impressed he was and who this man was and and he listened for a while and something about that man was different something was different he was so humble and yet so full of authority there's something special about this man he was drawn to him and the boy knew that he was a great man a man to be respected the Bible would say tell the account like this in John 6 and 5 when Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto Him he saith unto Philip when shall we buy bread that these may eat and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do don't you love that he already knows how he's gonna work out the situation in your life he already knows exactly how he's gonna bring about the end to an expected in for your good he already knows exactly what you're going through and he looks at and sometimes you get put in situations to where he can prove you listen it's not always going to be a flowery bed of ease you know if I'm will rain I must fight if I must rain increase my courage Lord there's times we're gonna go through things and we don't understand it but it says he already knew what he would do Phillip answer him two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little one of his disciples Andrew simon Peters brother said unto Him there is a lad here which has five barley loaves and two small fishes now listen to the very the very testimony of the disciple but what are they among so many even the disciple looked at a gift and he didn't value it this fella has a gift but what is that once that gift going to do at a meeting like this what's that gift gonna do at a service like this well put it in God's hand one time and watch there's been many at times there's been great gifted people that have stood in the middle of church services and sit there and they didn't hand it to the Lord and they may have belted with everything they had or even preached with everything they had but if it was a nun surrendered heart and it wasn't given to the Lord he couldn't do anything with it but in this moment the disciple looks at it and goes but but what is this among so many brother branham says here that Matthew was telling the story in Matthew's recounting the store and he's talking about when they're out on the boat giving the testimonies and he says and I asked him if I could have it and he said well I brought it for my dinner see this is something personal this is something he don't want anybody else to have maybe it's a complex no no it's this is mine no this is mine maybe it's a small gift that you're embarrassed for anybody to see cuz it's really not that much so you keep it hidden Matthew says he said I brought this for me but now listen but if it's to go to that man that I heard talk he can have it oh what an attitude tonight listen there's not much to it I don't really know I don't really know what you see in it I don't I don't see much in my gift but if it's for Jesus tonight he can have it I don't know what he sees in my life tonight I don't know why he'd want such a ring sinner like me I don't know I don't want people to see what I am but if it's for him tonight I'll give it to him I'll lay it all down for him if we can have that attitude tonight about everything in our life let this gift isn't much but if it's for Jesus I'll give it to him tonight I was giving every part of my being I'll give him every fiber of my being if it's for you Lord Jesus you can have it tonight Jesus can have it it's not much I may be a little embarrassed by it's poor man's food you see I'm sure you had a little bit of complex about what he had to offer Jesus because the scripture says they were barley loaves in the Bible times barley was a common crop in Israel I could said in Deuteronomy a land of wheat and barley but it was much more widely cultivated then than it is now and it was always valued less than wheat it was not considered fine flour we see this in 2nd King 7 1 where you see that the price of wheat is twice that of barley it even mentions it again in Revelation 6 when you see the price of wheat is much more than that of barley and in second Kings 7 1 it says then Elisha said hear you the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel so fine flour was worth twice as much as barley his poor man's food the rich people didn't eat barley as a matter of fact it was one of the main food sources for horses and donkeys it says in 1st Kings 4 and 28 barley also and straw for the horses and drama drama dairies brought they into the place where the officers were every man according to his charge it was also in the hill country the main food source of poor people and I'm sure at first he struggled to let the disciples have it he just sat there and saw such an important man such a mighty man words of life he recognized there's something special about this person and this man so important but my meal is so insignificant I've got nothing but poor people's food it's meaningless he probably thought that the Pharisees would never eat this the the Sadducees that they would they would never eat this I even heard one of his own disciples say that this isn't very much but what he did is he pushed past those thoughts he pushed past those complexes he pushed past that spirit of that wanted to make him feel insignificant he pushed past the complex and he said if this is for Jesus he can have it I love verse 11 verse 11 here is what makes all the difference John 6 11 it says and Jesus took the loaves and Jesus took the loaves will you give him your barley loaves tonight giving what you think is insignificant and what's the miracles he can do in your life give him what you think is insignificant and watch what he does in your home what's what he'll do an evening like Tabernacle if we'll just surrender the things that we think are insignificant the things that we think aren't that big a deal if we'll clean out the little things that we've been letting hold on to us if we'll just give it all to Jesus and what's the miracle that he will do I'm telling you tonight that he wants you and not just part of you he wants all of you he wants the parts of you that are in Barisan he wants the parts of you that nobody else knows about he wants you to come and lay them at his feet and he'll say and Jesus took his loaves and Jesus took his sins and Jesus took his complexes and Jesus took all his faults Jesus took all his failures Jesus took everything that you're giving tonight and he'll bless it and then he'll multiply his blessings upon your life whatever condition you're in tonight just say it's for Jesus he can have it and let Jesus take the loads tonight let him have your loads brother branham says and you notice as long as the lunch was in the little boy's hand it was just five loaves and two fishes but when it got into Jesus hand it fed 5,000 so the little things that we have if you just let him have it the little faith that we've got if we'll just let him have it it'll do great things he says you may not have very much but turn it loose I say turn the barley loose tonight turn it a little bit of faith you have loose tonight turn I'll turn it all loose tonight in the name of Jesus so let him have what you got if you got that much faith put it in him turn it loose and see what it'll do as long as his in the boys hand it wasn't much but when it got in here Jesus had it meant something it could it could only feed him there it could hardly do that but it fed 5,000 and take up baskets afterwards hallelujah my when I think of that my soul shakes and trembles when I think of what God can do with the life what he can do with your complexes and your shortcomings and your failures what he can turn us around we're nothing that we're on our way to hell a sinner's grave and a devil's hell but we put something in Jesus hands he'll lift you up and make a son or daughter of God on you tonight he'll forgive all your sins he'll forgive all your trespasses he'll fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you're just putting in Jesus hands tonight brother Brown says what kind of weapon you're gonna use you remember Pharaohs got a lot of chariots and swordsmen and horsemen and everything like that he had a Crooked Stick in his hand what's in your hand you might not be able to whistle but you can do something I think that did away with every excuse right there you might not can be able to whistle can't okay but you can do something whatever is in your hand use it to the glory of God give it to him and let him bless it and watch what takes place certainly no matter what it is it may seem little and insignificant to you but give it over to God one time the little boy had a lunch you wasn't very much to him but once in the hands of Jesus it fed 5,000 and they took up basketballs how many blessings and how many miracles are missed because we hold back what we have thank you how many blessings and miracles are missed because we hold back what we have to offer because we feel the barley loaves are insignificant you know sometimes things that even it even shocks the enemy what God does with some of the lives that come to him I think sometimes it even catches the enemy off guard when he he looks at somebody like me and then he sees what God has done and changed my life completely and he says you I know what he was I had him what I had him in my prison you're telling me he's going to do something for the kingdom of God you're telling me he's gonna stand in the last day and believe the endtime message that guy that guy was worthless guilty guilty as charged but when you lay it all down in Jesus feed when you give him the loaves and say just do what you will with it and you just become available he'll do amazing things in your life listen sometimes the enemy will become shot God takes maybe who people who maybe we think are nobodies once again he doesn't look at people and things and valued them the way that the world does look at the vision of Gideon judges seven thirteen now we've established what barley was and how barley was a port represented poor people in poor people's food and when Gideon was become behold there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow and said behold I dreamed a dream and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian and came into a tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent lay alone now notice even in the dream the man had Gideon had said over there and said I'm poor I'm no good I'm from a poor family they didn't like the guy had a dream and they said up and said now I mean there was this fine loaf of bread made from the best flour and it K note the dreams showed getting exactly as he was poor man it showed him exactly how it was it showed what God will do with a man that doesn't have anything to offer he said it was a barley cake that tumbled into the host of MIDI and he came into a Tim and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent lay long look Gideon has typed out here is a barley loaf Gideon and his whole army had peasant beginnings and the man in the tent because they know what Gideon is because they know what that army of peasants is they instantly recognize the vision and they say it his fellow Antron said this is nothing else says the sword of Gideon the son of joash a man of Israel for into his hand has God delivered Midian and all the hosts I'm telling you tonight that you can destroy every devil every enemy everything that rises up against you and everything that exalts itself against the Word of God if you'll just put yourself into God's hand I don't care if you are an old barley low tonight I don't care if you can't whistle tonight I don't care if you think you have nothing to offer tonight put yourself in God's hand tonight and let him go to work with you put yourself in God's hand tonight and let him take you down to the tents of the enemy and smash the tents and destroy the enemy and send a runner toward the border land we're not going to let him stay in our land any longer it doesn't matter what I have it's not about me it's not about you it's all about him and what he can do through us they said it's Gideon it's getting in the hand of the Lord I wonder how often they had made fun and criticized ol Gideon I wonder how often they made fun and picked on this poor old Gideon his little iller crew ill-equipped group of misfits but in God's hands in God's hand listen even light tabernacle let them say what they want about you let the world say what they want about you let the devil say what he wants about you that you know good that you're Memphis that you're never gonna amount to nothing but in God's hands I'm telling you we're coming to tear satan's kingdom down I'm telling you in God's hands we're gonna tear his kingdom now we're gonna plant his kingdom we're gonna defeat every demon of hell and then we're gonna take a lap shirt in God's hands we're gonna overcome it and we're gonna rise above it all because it's not about what we can do we're in God's hands tonight we put our loans in God's hands we put all that we are in God's hands tonight in God's hands weren't invincible army we've been seen in the vision victorious over all our enemies we've been commissioned to tear satan's kingdom down what I love about Gideon is once he got them on the run he didn't stop it says in judges 84 and Gideon came to Jordan and passed over he and three hundred men that were with them now how many men do they have when they started 300 here we are later in the battle and how many men are left 300 in God's hands we can't lose the one I'm telling you he's not gonna lose a worn that the father has given him he's not gonna lose a woman we're not leaving here and leaving one behind we're not leaving a hoof behind we're at the end of the battle and we got the same number because we're not giving up they may not be sitting here tonight but I'm claiming them tonight in our number because we're not leaving a hoof behind he says in 300 men that were with him faint yet pursuing them well let that be us tonight let that be us tonight it says faint and yet pursuing them they were faint yet pursue him they were tired from the battle and yet they were eager to do more damage to the enemy's kingdom sometimes we may be tired and worn down sometimes you may be feeling like I'm about to give up you're faint you're right on the verge but you just keep pursuing that promise you maybe faint and I can't I can't take another step no sir you just keep pursuing that devil you just keep chasing that devil you just stay right on him until you run it completely off your promised land you may be faint yet we're still pursuing we're pushing him off our land we're fighting him off our promises until we obtain every single one of them and eventually we're gonna push him and we're gonna run our selves right into a body change we may be faint but we're still pursuing tonight the Bible tells us to forget not all his benefits that don't neglect any of them don't elevate some and put others down and see these aren't these aren't as important oh you forget not all of them if it came from God it's worthy to be praised it's worthy to be acknowledged that's why he told them there in Deuteronomy once you come into the land you partake of all these things then it takes take a moment and praise the Lord for it all because he doesn't want you to forget any of the blessings that he's given you and we're told not to forget not all of his benefits we're to be robbed of nothing if God put it in the land it's yours now remember that if God put it in the land it's yours if it's in the word it's yours but you're gonna have to fight to protect it tonight we can't give up anything no matter how small we may think it is and we've dealt with that we can't put labels on things this is a small blessing this is a big blessing this is a small thing this is a big thing if it came from God it's to be ours we are to possess it because the devil doesn't ever stop at the small things sure he may just be nibbling a little bit here he may just be bringing a little bit of trouble here on this side but that's not his endgame he wants to destroy you your children your family and it's saying it seems that he'd wants to destroy entire churches he wants to wipe out people's faith and then in belief but lately it seems like here in our church and in other places as well and I'll just say this from my heart it seems like there's just been a great washing that's just been taking place in people's lives a great washing taking place in people's homes as people have been making their calling and election sure and people getting things in order and people have been sweeping out everything and making sure all the Levin's out of their life and Levin's out of their home and we've seen the power of the Holy Spirit just moving in services and moving in people's homes and and we've been getting even even testimonies from other places of the power of God and and in the Holy Spirit pouring out and people being baptized and just great miraculous things going on and I believe that God is doing some amazing things I believe we're right on the verge I believe we're right there at the blending of time and eternity I believe this with all my heart and God is doing some very special things and I believe tonight that it's time we push a little harder I believe it's time we push just a little bit harder we may be faint but we got to keep pursuing we may be tired and a little born out but we got to keep pursuing I believe it's time that we dig a little bit deeper I believe it's time that we begin to pray like Amram did and say God is time to fulfill these promises God I believe it's it's time for these things to come to pass and the reason we say that is I believe that we can say just like it said there in the book of Acts at the time of the promise has drawn nine it's time for us to take back all the enemy has tried to steal from us and we we can't even let in this time even the small things go Church it's going home time it's rapture time it's time to check up make sure your lamps are trimmed and bright just being a good person in a good church member in and coming to church all the time and maybe even listening to tapes that's good thank God you do that but it's time to dig deeper it's time to consecrate more is time for sincerity like you've never had sincerity before we're right here at the judgment time it's right here at the going-home time and we can't let the devil come in and take anything not even a little piece brother Branham would say just about the time you get the church built up where it's right that's when the devil will come in he said that's the time to get your righteous indignation up we were not to forget any of his benefits we are not to forget any of his promises we are not to forget any of his instructions there is nothing too small that in this time we can let go by the wayside his blessed is so abundantly Psalm 68 19 blessed be the Lord who daily loaded the s' with benefits even the god of our salvation se la Psalms 103 to bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits psalms 116 and 12 what shall i render unto the lord for all his benefits towards name it's time that we stand like israel standing and give no ground no matter how insignificant that ground may seem listen the enemy wouldn't want it if the ground was insignificant the enemy wouldn't be after your promise if he thought that promise was insignificant he wouldn't be after your joy if it wasn't important he wouldn't be after your peace if it wasn't important he's coming after it because to him it's worth fighting for its surprise to him it's a trophy to him but i'm telling you if you come against me and i'm standing with the living god one i'm the only one that's gonna have a trophy from this battle because i'm gonna take your head off i'm gonna raise it up for the whole camp to see and then we're gonna have a Philistine killing party we got to stand there when the enemy comes in if it's in the Word of God if it's promised to us we have to recognize it's worth fighting for it's worth standing for it's worth giving our life for every little piece it's worth giving your all for the fees for twenty seven neither give place to the devil that little thing he's fighting you over you say that's not a door he can't get in there but it may just be the foothold he needs it may be that one little finger hold he needs to get a hold of your life it may be the one little place he has access to you here in the word place in Ephesians means opportunity neither give opportunity to the devil but it also means here a portion of marked off space you can't even go okay devil that's your space stay there leave me alone I'll leave you alone you can't even give him a portion of Markov space first of all you're dealing with a liar a cheat a deceiver he's not going to stay in his portion he's not gonna stay there a minute the minute you turn your back you're gonna have a knife stuck in it because his job is to destroy you you can give him no place no piece of ground no matter how insignificant is he allowed to stay on no piece of promise no piece of the word no matter how much you may judge an insignificant can he be allowed to stay home we can't give him a portion we can't give him a space because he's not going to abide by look David had some mighty men that we read about we read about earlier and they didn't tolerate the enemy trespassing on their land I loved reading the accounts of the mighty men they did some mighty things they were some pretty incredible men the things that they would do and and because they were willing to stand they left a lasting legacy a testimony of men who were willing to fight for everything that was in the land they looked at it and said this is our land I don't care that that's just a rock that's my rock because it's inside my borders and you're not going to set foot on it they weren't willing to give the enemy anything they were willing to fight for all of in our opening scripture said in second Samuel 23 9 and after him was Eleazar the son of doto the Hawaii one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle and the men of Israel were gone away let's look at that part the men of Israel were gone away they had all fled they had all made a decision that this parcel of ground that they were fighting for wasn't worth fighting they said this this parcel of ground isn't worth dying for it's not worth it and they had gone away from the promises they had ran away chasing after new doctrines they had ran away chasing after worldly present pleasures but one Eleazar planted himself right in the middle of that promise he planted himself right in the middle of that field and he stood there and he's in he defied the Philistines there were Philistines in the land and someone was going to be willing to deal with my love how it says they defied the Philistines the word here actually means to rail against he wasn't sitting there quietly he was telling them everything they were everything they weren't everything he was about to do to them if they dared come over there he he was running his mouth he was letting them know exactly how it's going to be it says this word means to abrade and to taunt listen they didn't come into play church they didn't come into play church they didn't sit quietly and sit there praise Lord he came in and said listen here devil this is my land you're no good you're sorry I'm gonna kill you you think you want some of this you think you want this piece of ground how about you come over here and try to take this piece of ground and he playing himself right there on the promise and he stood there and it reminds me of the history of the Texas Revolution when a small group of men at the Battle of Gonzales which was the very first battle of the first skirmish of the resolution they had a cannon there in Gonzales and the mixing government sent a general and some soldiers and said I want you to go confiscate their cannon so this Mexican army comes marching and and in the men and Gonzales were outnumbered and the Mexican commander comes with orders to remove the cannon from the town and he sends a message to him and he says I've come to take the cannon we're going to take it away from you and that and the Texans there raised a flag in response and the flag they had stitched a big black cannon on it with with four words come and take it if more of us would have that attitude tonight when the enemy tries to come in instead of watching out the window as he's trampling all through our field and sitting sitting in the living room while your kids are wasting hours and hours on a worthless video game or snap chatting with some boy that you don't even know who they are putting on mascara in the back room while the Devils coming in stealing your happiness coming in stealing your piece how about you plant yourself right in the middle of one [Applause] [Applause] you're not taking our toy you're not taking our piece you won't have my children come and take it stand up in the face of the enemy tonight and say how about you come and take it if you think you come and take it that's what Elly's you're told the Philistines come and take it you got to make the decision that it's worth fighting for I ain't giving that devil one thing a man cannonball I'm not handing him over anything that God has promised me God said it was mine what makes him think I'm gonna give it to him and I got more than a cannon waiting on him I'm telling you I'm coming to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the name above all names every knee is going to bow and every tongue is going to confess you will move off my promise devil you will move off my children's life you will give me my peace back my home will serve and overcome through the Living God you will move sparked a revolution we need a revival sparked in our homes in our family telling one time come and take it quick giving it away telling come and take it second Samuel 2310 says and he arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clayvin to the sword and the Lord wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil all those that had run away all those that didn't think it was worth fighting for all those who didn't want to get down in the trenches and fight the enemy now they return people who won't stand up and be identified people who don't think that some of the small things are worth the fight people who have let down the bar Sunday and Wednesday Christians only show up to collect the blessing but they don't want to get down in the trenches and do the fighting during the week one commentator would say regarding this it's common for those who quit the field when anything is to be done to hasten back to it when anything is to be gotten they just want the blessing without the fight without a battle they want to come and spoil from the victory but they wanted to sit back and once you do all the fighting what was it that was so important in that field what was it that even when all others ran Eleazar stood what was it that caused him to rail against them and even taunt them what was of such great value that it was worth dying for another account of this is in first Chronicles exact same story will chapter 11 verse 12 says and after him was Eleazar son of doto the Oh Hawaii who was one of the three Mahdi's who was with David at pasta man and there the philistines were gathered together to battle where was a parcel of ground full of barley animal food food for the poor and the people fled from the before the philistines and they set themselves in the midst of that parcel and delivered it and slew the philistines and the lord saved them by great deliverance listen barley wasn't worth very much but it was supposed to be in the land he said I'll give you a land with wheat and barley and figs and honey it was listed in the promise so it doesn't matter what mans value was it doesn't matter that other people said it wasn't worth anything he looked at and said that's part of the promise that's part of God's Word and I'm about to set myself down right in the middle of it and I dare you to come try to take a piece of God's Word from me it was worth fighting for it was worth dying for because it was in the word because it was part of the promise one group said it's just a barley field it's just one little barley field and the enemy's so many and I'm not gonna die for that this isn't worth it Eleazar said but it's in the promised land it's mine Eleazar said it's in the promised land it's mine and I will give the enemy no place to stand it wouldn't matter what kind of field it was it could have been a weed field that was growing nothing but bad terrible stuff but it refused in the promised land Eleazar was about to get off of his behead you're not going to stand in one of my fields I don't care what it's growing it's in my land it's part of my promises you're not taking my kids that part of my promise you're not taking my joy or my promise you're not taking the Holy Ghost experience under the church it's promised to be here you're not gonna rob this generation of an opportunity of revival the same chance you got I'm gonna stand right here proclaim truth and fight off every enemy that tries to rob the Word of God from us it was in the word it doesn't matter what others say if it's promised if it's in the word it's worth fighting for stand for truth when others run away brother Brown says if this isn't the truth it's the biggest arrow of error the world's ever had but if it is the truth then I'm willing to die for it and I have found that every word is true there's no shadow of doubt in my mind I love how I said he stood there and he defied the Philistine I say tonight we stand and defy any thing that would exalt itself against the promises of God defy the enemy when others promote false doctrines defy the enemy when he tries to come in and rob the holy ghost out of our services defy the enemy we wants to come in and keep this generation from having a revival we defy that you young people can have the Holy Ghost it's for you and as - as many as the Lord God shall call defy the enemy that that wants you to come in and wear makeup and fold - peer pressure defy the enemy when when others are wearing immoral clothes stand up and exalt modestly and exalt holiness defy the enemy say it's in the word I'm gonna stand on it you may not think it's worth the battle you may not think it's worth the ridicule you may wear away from it I'm not running away from it it's in the word I'm going to stand on it if you want to receive the big blessings of God then you got to keep even the smallest words of God you got to stand on every word not give in because mighty men leave legacies mighty men leave legacies that they're not going to bend and they're not going to break they're not going to give up the barley field I'm not going to allow the enemy to take any of my promises but further here and it's just a barley field it's just a little thing it's not that big a deal listen you can't have that attitude denied he gave you barley it's in the land it's a big deal you're to possess it it's time to stand there and say come and take it if you think you want this barley if it's worth the fight to you if it's worth dying for to you I'm right here come and take it this is the very same barley field I'm not gonna have time to really go into this but I found this so awesome passed them in is the very same barley field that the Philistines had camped in when Goliath was coming out to make his boast this is the very same place they had camped when Goliath would walk out of this barley field and walk out and challenge the armies of the Living God and everyone had run away except David and now here we are once again and now here's David once again with his mighty men and once again everyone's run away but mighty men don't run men of faith don't run men of faith leave a legacy men of faith leave a testimony and Dave and his mighty men stand in the same place once again and say I come to you in the name of Jesus Christ I come to you to take your head off you let that devil know Jesus has paid for it all I'm standing here listen recognize this this is the same place that the Philistines were defeated and completely slaughtered just because you have a victory over the devil in one area of your life doesn't mean he's not gonna come back there and try you again doesn't mean he's not gonna come back there and scratch at the windows and howl and claw at the door but he can't get back in he can't come back in if you'll stand there on the word and say no you've been defeated here once before we stand here once again to rebuke you once again you're gonna be defeated just as soundly this time as you were last time they're standing in the very same place that David stood and the enemies come back again to a place he's been defeated to challenge them once again and Dave and his mighty men are standing there why are they standing there because the promises are worth fighting for I believe tonight your promises are worth fighting for I believe you as an individual are worth fighting for I believe Jesus Christ felt that way when he fought his way up Calvary's Hill and fought through every devil of hell and everything try he could have walked away from that but he said you're worth fighting for he said you're worth dying for and he sent back promises and he sent back his word and he said you could have peace he said you could have joy you could have helped he said you can have a healthy marriage he said that you could have your children I believe it's all worth fighting for tonight I believe you have to fight tonight I believe it tonight that it's your opportunity to deliver the barley there may be an enemy standing there in your field tonight but you're an heir to all things you're an heir to all things look fear has stood in your barley field way too long depression has stood out there and your barley field way too long that sickness and student sickness has stood in your barley field way too long it's how you take the sword tonight the sword of the Spirit and you march out there to that barley you let him know you're not staying here one more minute you're not staying here one more hour this is my barley field this is my promise this world was given to me you're gonna go or you're gonna die you're gonna go or I'm going to take your head off you're leavin here one way or another this is my field this is my promise you stayed here too long and tonight you are gonna leave in the name of Jesus these things are in the promise forget not all his benefits we are heirs of all his benefits listen to brother Branham he says I'm an heir of divine healing I'm an heir of joy I got a right to be happy you don't think it's a big deal brother Brown said I got a right to be happy so what makes you so happy I got a right to be how do you know because I'm an heir to it amen now I feel religious yes I'm an heir to happiness I'm a narrative joy I'm an heir to peace I'm an heir to eternal life I'm a narrative the Holy Spirit hey man I'm an heir to every evidence it's got a man I'm an heir to the authority of God amen who made you that not me he did every one of you is an heir to the same thing as an heir to the throne he that overcometh shall set with me on my throne as I have overcome and set on my Father's throne amen an heir of all things not just one thing all things everything is under your feet even death is under your feet the grave is under your feet hell is under your feet and sin is under your feet amen he says everything is under your feet because you're an heir you were dead and your life is hid in God through Jesus Christ your rose again to eternal life and sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus oh my whoo call us anything you want call us what you want to say we're crazy if you want to but we're heirs heirs to what all things are you an heir to the brown Tabernacle nope I'm an heir to all things both sing present future to everything I'm an heir to it if that don't make you happy right there and every sin and wickedness has been under my feet and by the grace of Jesus Christ he rose on Easter morning triumph over death hell and the grave and made me an heir wait yonder and I'll give you the promise and his anointed authoritative servant said this promise is unto you to your children just then that's a far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call I'm an heir amen amen Jesus proof Jesus proved it to us on his resurrection oh my when we've entered the battlegrounds between death and life I'm a sinner brother branham you don't have to be you're a sinner because you desire to be you don't have to be the debts already paid brother branham I wish I had joy you can have it you're just letting Satan rob you from the privilege that Christ died for I'm an heir to it it's all mine everything he died for belongs to me belongs to you we're his children were heirs of it everything that he died for hallelujah he says there you are this is my story this is my song I'm an heir of salvation what is salvation something that's given to you it's a gift I'm an era of salvation what kind for eternal life salvation for my soul salvation for my body salvation for my wilderness salvation for everything that pretty much covers it all I'm an heir to everything and I'm not gonna let the devil who's not an heir have a piece of it at all I'm an heir to joy I'm a narrative salvation I'm an heir to the Holy Spirit I'm an heir to the kingdom of God he's gone away to prepare a place for me that I'm a tear to glory hallelujah your heirs tonight don't let him rob you of any of it he's not at the reading of the will it's not his I'm an heir to everything he said what kind of salvation he said salvation for everything he says he keeps he satisfies he heals he delivers there's joy there's peace he bestows grace He bestows mercy He bestows at all and tonight when the Devils coming into your land coming into your field coming into your home I say you take the name of Jesus and you go get every one of those promises that belong to you you take the name of Jesus and you go on the offensive and you take your stand in the barley field are the promises and use a lasting legacy what kind of legacy are you gonna leave behind how will people remember you one who fled and came back only to spoil or one who stood there and fought the devil until his hand clave to a sore one who stood there and swung the word of the Lord so much that his hand couldn t become loose from it soon many today their hands are cleaving to some ball or a bat or a remote control or something like that that'll never deliver you that'll never set you free but if you grab ahold at this one time and say I'm not gonna let go and you hold on to and you go to swinging and fighting and killing and standing on your promises say I'm not going to move how about you come and take it and one day they may have to cleave this out of my hand but I'm going to leave a legacy behind that I stood for truth I delivered the barley field I didn't let the enemy stay there I don't care what kind of field it was it's in my land I will deliver the barley and tonight even like Tabernacle where it wraps her time we're it going home time and it's time you deliver the barley fields in your promised land those things that may not seem like big deals but the enemies can't down run them out send a packet they have no right to stay there we're about to go home but you've got to clean out the land you've got to clean them out if you're going to possess everything that God has for you I believe it's there for you I believe we're going to take it but we got to press down we got to press in we got to take the word and stand on that promise tonight cut through the darkness so we bring this down to a close see small things add up to big things just keep picking up the handfuls and by the end of the night you got a bag full you got a sack full but you got to pick up the little things as you go and you start picking them up before long you got an abundance just keep walking in victory keep claiming every promise and letting the enemy have no place to stand no place I don't care what kind of field you find him standing in your life tonight give him no place stand there tonight with the word and say you will have no place in my promised land you will have no opportunity to get into my life I'm going to take care of this while it's a little Fox one-day Church we're going to deliver the barley one last time one day it's going to be the last time you have to fight one day it's gonna be the last time that you have to get up and look at that old devil in the eyes but until he takes his home I'm gonna make sure he ain't got nothing that belongs to me until he takes me home on my stand and fight and I'm gonna value everything that's in the word I'm not gonna put some things down I'm gonna say if it's in the word it belongs to me we're right on the verge of the greatest promise finally coming to pass prophet God says do you believe it say Amen what's the next thing we're looking for the rapture going to meet him the coming son will have to be changed and caught up you can't be caught up the way you are now you're too heavy oh but brother one day this mortal will take on immortality and will have a body like his own glorious body for we shall see him as he is oh you seed of Abraham hold to your promise he says hold to your promise honey stay with it don't let no man rob you from that even in light Tabernacle let no man no spirit no devil of hell rob you of everything the Lord has given you because we're right at the point we're fixing to go home we're fixing to take a rapture I want us all to go make sure there's no little foxes running around in your barley fields deliver the barley tonight you bow your heads with me you know the way that the enemy comes at me may be different from the way that he comes at you some people we may come without fear unbelief some people he may come with trouble in the home but usually it starts with the small things sometimes it starts with things that we don't deem very important it starts and things that we don't value as much as a because the world sometimes warps our idea of value what true value really is the world warps our idea of what's worth fighting for I want to say it once again if it's in the word it's worth fighting for if it's in the promises it's worth fighting for the barley field was in the promised land and eleazar left a legacy a lasting legacy I ask you tonight what will be your legacy will you be one who stood there and defied the the enemy I stood there and said I won't give you an inch I won't back up or you be one who ran away when the fight got too tough and you didn't think it was that big of a deal what will be your legacy we're going home Church we're going home we're right here at it deliver your barley field father we love you with all of our heart well we thank you that you've given us the strength Lord to deliver the message I just pray father that you'll take it and use it how you see fit what I pray that we won't just be hearers of the word door but we'll be doers Lord many things I said tonight spoke directly to my heart and pricked my heart things I need to take care of Lord Jesus may we not be guilty of neglecting any of your promises may we not be guilty Lord of forgetting even one of your benefits Lord you've died that we could have those things Lord you went through agonizing punishment and took horrible stripes and worse beaten so I could have those benefits lord give us the strength to stand and the courage to stand now when people want to take those benefits away when spirits want to come in and rob us of the joy of our salvation of the peace that passes all understanding though there's people that fight anxiety and fear and you said I will keep him in perfect peace but we have a word Lord those things are in our promised land and what I found it to be such a good landlord it's even more than what I could have imagined it would be Lord this land is wonderful Lord may I never let a squatter some evil spirit come in and squat on this land or they're not part of the inheritance they're not heirs like we are give us strength to stand Lord may be weary tonight Lord but may we be pursuing maybe worn out from the battle but may we still be pursuing until the enemy is all driven out until the kingdom of Satan has been torn down Lord may he not have one day of peace as long as we're on this earth but may we defy him and stand on the promises tonight Lord we love you bless every person here tonight every family this represented Lord I pray that your presence will go with us as we depart we love you Lord in Jesus precious and then we pray [Music] [Music] what can you do with your hands tonight Oh but what can he do with your Barney loads if you'll just place them in his hands to take my things we talk about on a daily
