[Music] have been going through the supernatural books and hey man just we're talking about this story brother branham tells in jehovah gyra about a young man that had a chain around his neck they were leading him like a dog and came into the prayer line and said he discerned his heart and his heart was for his brother's healing [Music] amen it doesn't matter how far the situation looks doesn't matter how far away he feels he's here right now to meet every need hallelujah hallelujah he can discern down to the very intent those that look like they're insane and he can look and beyond that how much more can he see our needs tonight hallelujah as brother timothy comes let's just sing that verse one more time amen he lives tonight and he's here to meet every need hallelujah i know my redeemer lives i know [Music] let our creations [Music] amen i'm thankful we're serving a risen savior amen we're not talking about somebody that's been dead and gone laying rotten in the grave somewhere but he's alive today amen living in his people amen still doing the same work still doing the same things in the body of christ amen let's just borrow our heads today as we take our hearts to him in prayer father lord we just come to you lord just asking once again that you would help us father you'd speak to us lord you would be with us this evening lord that you administer to hearts and lives give us strength i pray father lord we just ask the lord that you anoint this word lord that it comes off of our lips it did not just be me or something i've thought of it'll be the very thoughts of god we just commit our hearts to you lord be with those who are traveling to the different meetings lord keep your hands on them we pray we commit this service to you in jesus name amen luke chapter 12. turn the bibles to luke chapter 12. amen i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord amen it's a wonderful oasis to better come together in the mid-week and just kind of let off the pressure and start worshiping and praising the lord and letting his presence come around us and amen here you know facts may say one thing but we're thankful we have the truth and the truth is what sets us free amen amen luke chapter 12 and verse 27 consider the lilies how they grow they toil not they spin not yet i say unto you that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these like one of these consider the lilies how they grow they toil not and they spin not amen we'll let you be seated like to speak to you this evening on the drawing power of the light drawing power of the light amen you know i also want to read in john chapter 6 and verse 44 it says no man can come to me except the father which has sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day this word draw it means to pull upward by inward power is to lead or to impel he would also say in john chapter 12 and verse 32 and if i be lifted up from the earth i will draw all men unto me amen so i just want to look at this thought on the drawing power of the light it's amazing that jesus would use this thought on the lilies and he would say look at them consider them you know the lilies or or the plants and things they don't told they don't spin but yet solomon all of his glory was not arrayed like one of these amen so there had to be something that was causing them to grow there had to be something that was causing them to come out of the ground to amen to come out and to give uh to grow up to a place where their leaves could come out and the green would turn and and then it would turn into a beautiful flower and it would show the beauty that was what was on the inside and we know that we can look and around us and we could see the life that we live we can see in the in the sun and the phases of the sun that's why we have the winters and the falls and and the summers and the springs is because actually it's the sun that is the angle of the earth as it would turn it would move it changes the impact of the sun upon the earth and therefore in certain seasons you can have growing seasons in certain seasons you have dying seasons certain seasons you have real hot heat and and different or more warmth than others you have cold because it's the power of the sun or the effects of the sun and the sun can get seeds i've read read today that seeds can lay literally for 50 years 100 years many years and never come to life but once it gets in the right atmosphere or the right place and the right circumstances around it and the sun begins to pull upon it it begins to pull it out of the earth no matter how long it laid there dead no longer no matter how long it was there without life when that sun began to call for its life it came to life and man we can say that on our own lives many of us laid in darkness we laid in sin we laid in unbelief we laid in places of all kinds of things different walks of life different places but every one of us was in darkness was born in sin shaped an iniquity came in this world speaking lies so we were all born in darkness we were all born in a place a man seemingly dormant seemingly no life but the sun began to pull things out of us that we didn't even know was there and this is how it is you know with a pond lily you can look at a lily that comes out of a pond and out of the dirt now the muck and then the muddy waters all around it but all of a sudden something begins to draw it from the earth and where it's down below fair you can't even see it with your own eyes so far down it's so deep in there you thought there'd be nothing there that would have that kind of life or that kind of beauty but the sun begins to pull it out of that mud and the sun begins to pull it out of that muck and that mire and things that had cased around it for years and years and years and it begins to draw a life out of there amen out of that darkness and out of that place and it begins to bring it to the part amen and brother bran will say when it comes up through all of that and it gets into the presence of the sun then it's born and that little seed bursts into life and and it goes through all that process amen what makes it do that he said it's the sun itself it's what's drawing it from the mud it's the sun itself that's drawing it from the filthy waters and the muck and then it comes forth and it's so happy and so free and so beautiful he said i think that's a beautiful type of the christian life something is drawing you out of this world amen something is drawing you out of the place that you thought you belonged in you thought that's who you were you thought your life was set you thought that's what you would always be but something on the inside began to respond to something amen it wasn't you seeking god it was god seeking you it was a son seeking that life amen that was laying on the inside of you amen just like you know he said how beautiful it is and he said if you try to help it come up you'll kill it amen it has to move on its own it has to respond to the sun on its own amen he said just like a chicken when it's being born you ever notice one of those little fellows right on top of his little beak is this little hard spot amen as it begins to come into that egg and all the egg begins to rot away it realizes i have to get out of here i have to move out of this place into another dimension and all those old inner parts of that egg begins to rot but all of a sudden something on the inside of that little chicken begins to say i gotta get out of here i don't belong in here no more this is not where i this is not where i'm going to stay this might be a temporary place but this is not my home and it begins to peck and it begins to scrape against that old shell and it begins to try and then they call pimping its way out and it begins to peck against it how many has ever seen that you put in an incubator all of a sudden you see that egg all of a sudden that whole hard shell it just cracks open what's happening that little chicken on the inside of there saying i need out but there's something drawing it out of there amen it's not just on its own there's a atmosphere that's pulling it there's a there's a something on the outside that is greater than the force that's holding it on the inside amen and i'm thankful to god that when i came to him amen i knew i realized at one moment this is not who i am this is not who i belong this is not who i'm supposed to be amen i got to get out of here and let's take it another step further amen we're not here we're here in this world for a temporary time in a diff temporary place but i believe there's some believers that are pimping their way out of here amen this is not where i belong this is not who i am this world is not my home i'm only passing through here amen i'm looking for a way out of here amen what is it it is a call from another dimension it is a pull that is upon our lives it's not something that we're trying to conjure up on our own or try to do on our own we can't produce a body change on our own we can't produce something on our own but by faith in the word of god that said i'm going to have a bride without spot without wrinkle i'm going to have somebody that's going to be alive and remain and they will be changed and we begin to read that word and we begin to eat that word and we begin to become that word and we go to pepin to get peeping against that old dark world that we're in and we're saying this world is not my home there's another place i belong amen there's another place amen that i belong it's god's provided way you try to help him he'll kill him amen that's why preachers amen as we speak you know you have to come you have to die out we can't make you do nothing amen we can pray for you we can ask god to move on your life amen but you have to say i want out of the situation i'm in amen i want i want to leave where i'm at and go to where i'm being drawn to i want to be pulled into another place amen amen see you begin to pick the shell off of that person or that little that little chicken he'll die he's got the labor he's got the strain he's got to break forth that's the way of a christian's got to do it it ain't somebody just shaking your hands and taking you in you got to lay there till you die and rot and born into the kingdom of god it's god's provided way we don't go in by a book we don't go in by a shake of hands or a joint or a pump up or a pull down you simply have to get away from that old shell hallelujah you have to get away from that old thing and say i don't want to stay here amen you know god is pulling but you have to respond to the pull you got to respond to the call you got to respond to what he has he said there's no better way ever been found he said just like a little dew drop it falls to the earth and when it does it's born in the night amen born in the night born in the darkness but in the morning it's laying there cold and shivering on a little blade of grass and hanging on or maybe hanging on a clothesline but just as that sun begins to shine do you notice how happy that little dew drop gets it begins to glisten it begins to quiver what is it it knows that the sunlight is going to draw it back to where it was at the beginning hallelujah amen maybe that explains some things to some folks they wonder why we get happy in the presence of god they wonder why we act like we do in the presence of god i'm just a little dew drop and the sun is shining on me i can't help but glisten because i know it's pulling me back to where i was in the beginning because i wasn't a sinner in the beginning i wasn't lost in the beginning i wasn't without god in the beginning i was in his mind before the foundation of the world so as every man or woman that's born the spirit of god there's something about it when that light spreads over us hallelujah we get happy because we know we're going back to where we came from from the bosom of god it can sparkle with joy when the sun hits it of course knowing it's going back to where it came from how many knows you're going back to where you came from amen this world is not our home amen this atmosphere that we're in is not where we belong i mean the sin and all the things around us it's not who we are amen you know we know the old seeds amen before it become a new seed it's got it's got a rod amen has got to die we know that to be the truth it's the same thing with a new birth you never go back you go forward to where you're born again amen that's why i think today says there's not so many genuine new verses because the seed maybe will sympathize with the word or with the preacher but they don't want to rot away from that old system they're in that old idea that old thought amen they don't want to let it go well that thing that has held them they don't want to allow it to fall away and to rot out of their lives they want to act like you know well i've asked for forgiveness it's got to be like i was and there's no true repentance come on now amen many of people are sorry just because they got caught they're not truly sorry to repent as they're sorry because they got caught and so they got caught they want to say i'm sorry and go back to what they was amen in the beginning had a place they had or the position whether it be a a preacher or a husband or wife or whatever they want that same respect they want that same authority but that only comes by true repentance that only comes by dying out and being born again amen they don't want to come on it they want to stay in that old system and claim the new birth or the message of the age and they found it to luther or wesley or pentecost or other places they want to try to hold on to the old system and claim this or claim that but that old system must die it must rot in order to bring forth a new one but they want to cling to it amen they want to hold on to it you know but many people begin to think that well i've been seeking god but it wasn't really you seeking god it was god seeking you it was god pulling on you it was actually god pulling you to the place that you are today you're not sitting here on this pew because of you you're not sitting here on this pew because of some person somewhere you're sitting here because god has pulled you to this place you're not who you are because of you you're not who you are in your christian walk because of what you've done or how hard you work or what you you're there because god has called you to that place he's pulling you no man can come to me except the father draws me that draws him you said oh i sought god i went to seek in him no no god's been seeking you amen not you seeking god human nature proves that we don't have to go back but just to the beginning of the bible and see adam's sin he didn't start hunting god god where are you i need you god no god came looking for him adam where are you adam where are you adam where are you jesus said no man can come to me except the father draws him then god drawed you first hallelujah he drawed you first now listen to this i thought this was interesting he said how many here sinner or saint had said i know that god has spoke to me and he's trying to get me to come to his son christ jesus let me see your hand have you how many in here has ever felt the pull of god in other words listen this he said just raise your hand sinner is saint don't matter who you are he said you mean there's only one third of this people that's ever heard god speaking to you to become a christian only one-third he said i ought to change my text and preach the gospel and call for an altar call amen every person ought to have the right to hear one time god calling on their lives god pulling on them now there are those that hurt him many times but refuse to call amen they turned it down he said no one can come to me except god the father draws him jesus said then when he comes i will no wise cast him out hallelujah what a promise that is when you respond to his call he's not going to turn you down when you respond to him and say god i heard you and i'm coming to you as hard as i can come i'm laying aside my old garments i'm laying aside my pride i'm laying aside my unforgiving spirit i'm laying it all down i'm coming to you he said if you'll come like that i won't cast you out hey man if we could literally see i know we did it one time in the skit kind of put it put a visual to what really is happening in the other rounds how many knows that right in this building there's spirits of every kind right in this building there's angels amen all around there's a war spiritual warfare that's taking place amen if we could see what is happening the words going forth and the holy spirit's following the word and he's wanting to see it come to pass in somebody's life amen and he's standing there and he's pulling and he's pulling how many remembers that skin and i believe it was brother aaron standing back there pulling pulling as the preacher was preaching the angel was back there pulling it happens every service there's a poll there's a call amen why what what made you come to an altar not you there was a pole there amen they what made you cam come tonight not you there was a pole there it was a deep that calleth unto the deep and there has to be a deep to respond you say well i sought god no you didn't god sought you it's god seeking you not you seeking god you never did it your nature is wrong you're a pig you don't know any different amen you don't know any different you just live in a pig pen that's all you know you love it drink beer slop around run to the next man's wife doing everything you can do to do evil it seems good oh brother we're having a big time you think it's good but all of a sudden god knocks at your heart that's what changes everything hallelujah all i said you might have been in the middle of a drink but all of a sudden god started quickening something you don't belong here this is not who you are you don't belong in this place you don't belong in this situation this is not where you are this is not who you are amen you're my son amen what is it it's the holy spirit that begins to fall over you and begin to woo and cool under here and begin to pull amen the life that is laying on the inside of you hallelujah amen he don't care where he has to go there's no place too bad that god can't get to a seed of god there's no darkness too dark that he can't go beyond and pierce through it and come to that seed and say hey i'm knocking at your heart amen you don't have to stay where you are that's not who you are get up there's better in the father's house god knocks at your heart that's what changes everything not you knocking at god god's knocking at you amen amen adam never knocked at god's heart god was knocking at adam's heart that's right before adam could be a son of god god had to knock at his heart because you become a son before you can become a son of god god has got to knock at your heart many people say well i saw god i saw god i saw god that's error god sought you not you seeking god it wasn't adam running up and down the garden hauling father father where art thou it was god screaming adam adam where art thou hallelujah i'm so thankful he called my name hallelujah amen he reflected that what all man was adam did a runner a fighter instead of a man coming right out and confessing is wrong and being honest before god he tries to hide back behind some kind of fig leaf affair some man may think it's still in the nature of man to do it it's just in him trying to do it himself instead of just saying i'm wrong god help me i'm wrong instead of just taking god at his word he tries to bypass it he tries to live with that unforgiveness and still be a christian hello he still tries to do all those things and still have a form of godliness shall we read it was it second timothy 3 perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers their own self covenants boasters proud blasphemers disobedience apparent unthankful unholy without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despiser of those that are good traity traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than love of god having a form of godliness he didn't say some he said all of these are doing that but they have a form of godliness they're all doing that but they're in church they're all doing that but they're still proclaiming a part of christianity they're all doing that but they're saying i'm going in the rapture they try to bypass it instead of just taking god at his word instead of just saying you know what i was wrong i don't need to hold this no more i'm going to let it go god help me ministers today many of them trying to weigh and find a way to bypass divine healing they're trying to find a way to bypass the baptism of the holy ghost there's no way to bypass it people will go on receiving it just to say hallelujah i love that that's the word of the prophet he said they're trying to bypass divine healing they're trying to bypass the baptism of the holy spirit period but there's no way to bypass it people will go on receiving it just the same because it's the promise of god and his word will be fulfilled jesus said we wouldn't argue with jesus would we say it again no man can come to me except my father draw him first then it was god knocking on your heart not you seeking god it was god seeking you amen see the covenant is to you also as it was with abraham listen it wasn't abraham looking for god it was god looking for abraham abraham probably would have been just satisfied living his life out in earth but god came looking for him god began to pull on him and said abraham i've got something better for you i'm not going to get into all that because we know what the pastor had been preaching on amen but see the light of god began to draw him out of the place that he was into the promised land amen it wasn't abraham looking for god it was god looking for abraham it was god pulling on him and saying come walk with me amen it wasn't rebecca that was looking for god that day it was the angel of light the angel of god that came down and brother branham would say beat eliezer to the well by about 30 minutes and it began to pull and begin to pulsate there at the well calling that heart amen rebecca i might have been happy knitting or cooking or whatever she was doing they were there doing whatever her normal duties of the day amen and working just as hard as she could work amen but all of a sudden something began to pull something began to pulsate on the inside of her go to the well go to the well go to the well i ain't getting time to go the way i don't i got other things to do go to the well go to the well i can't go right now i got this to do go to the well what was it there was an angel sitting over there at the well and saying come on rebecca i got a visitation for you you can't miss it you got to be at this place so i can reveal to you who you really are and what your purpose really is oh hallelujah amen you thought you was a druggie you thought you was a drunkard you thought you was somebody else down in the world and down in sins or maybe you thought you was a baptist or a methodist or a presbyterian or a catholic but all of a sudden the angel of god came to a well and it began to send a pulsation of light and it began to go down to the darkness where you was at and began to call and it began to call you it began to pull on you it began to draw you out of where you was to where you are now hallelujah and every devil in hell try to put his face in there in your path he tried to stand up and say no you can't go but that light was greater than he was and it kept pulling and it kept drawing and it kept pulling and it kept drawing it pulled you into justification it pulled you into sanctification and pulling you into the holy ghost and one of these days and that final pull is going to pull us out of these old mortal bodies into immortality [Applause] he reached down and chose you and you never chose him he chose you mercy out of the millions in the world today out of the billions in the world today he chose you because he put your name on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world that's what the bible said before was there was a world he chose you before there was sin he chose you before there was demons he chose you and he don't change his mind oh we ought to better rejoice on that one even when he wasn't sin he didn't change his mind even when you did run straight away from him he didn't change his mind even when he was clouded up with every darkness and every kind of doubt every kind of spirit of hell he didn't change his mind he just kept pulling he just kept drawing amen he just kept moving amen kept bringing her to the place where you're at amen you said well brother tell me i'm not worthy of this amen none of us are worthy of this it ain't about whether we was worthy or not it was he chose me amen it isn't about amen you say well i'm not worthy of healing it ain't about whether you're worthy of healing or not it's about is the lamb worthy of the giving of the healing is he able to provide it is he powerful enough is the blood and we know the answer to that yes he is amen so it's not about us being worthy that's the devil's thinking again he's trying to put the spirit of unworthiness upon our young people that they don't feel worthy enough amen to be born again they don't feel worthy enough to be in church they don't feel worthy enough amen to be in the family they was born in you wasn't born in the family you're born in amen because you was worthy enough you're not sitting on this pew because you're worthy enough you're sitting there because god chose you to be there and if god chose you to be there there ain't enough devils in hell that can keep you from your place amen because we got a lamb who is worthy hallelujah you know we can we know the story of the old covenant when the that little mule was born out in a pasture during the night during darkness so i don't know whether you're formed in the department or not but this mural was born with floppy ears horrible looking mule crawl sided knocked kneed and bow legged tail stuck straight up in the air what a horrible looking thing he can look around his man and say you know what as soon as this master comes out of the house he'll knock me in the head i'm not even worth eating i'm not even worth the food i can provide i'm no good but if this mammy was really instructed she'd say wait a minute son just a minute i'm going to tell you something you don't know that's what i want to tell you see you don't know who you are you don't who you are you were born under a birthright and when the master of the house i don't care what you look like but when the master of the house comes out you got to see he's got a new mule born then the thing he has to do is get a lamb without blemish and take that perfect lamb and he dies so you can live and when that little mule began to hear those words he could kick up his heels and have a big time amen it's not me that's worthy it's not me that looks good enough or acts good enough it's a lamb that's worthy and he's called me by name he said that's the way it is with us we're imperfect we have imperfections no good born in sins shaped in iniquity come in the world speaking lies we were no good to begin with but i want you to understand something god don't look at you he came looking for you hallelujah he don't look at you and inspect you and say well is he worthy enough to receive my grace let me see he wouldn't find anyone worthy enough they ain't a person in this building is worthy enough for what we've received as far as on our own human human genealogies or human abilities or human works and things we ain't none of us worthy of the grace that we have received but he didn't come looking at you he's already looked at something he looked at a lamb that was hung on a tree and he said that lamb was perfect and that blood came rolling down on that earth what was that blood doing it began to speak better things than the blood of abel the blood of abel began it was speaking murder and and hatred and jealousy that's what the blood of abel spoke but when the blood of jesus came down it began to speak out names that were redeemed before the foundation of the world hallelujah that blood began to call out your name and it's been going for two thousands of years through every church age calling out the names of the seeds that were down there in the darkness he came looking for you he looks at the sacrifice but he's looking for you he looks at the lamb but he's looking for you because when he sees you he don't see you he sees christ jesus died for you now if you can find some fault with jesus then your healing might not be right if you can find fault with him then things might not be perfect if you can find thought with him then maybe there's nobody worthy but he called you by his grace not that you would but it was god if god would and god would he has called you he has pulled you he has brought you to this place and if he's brought you here to this place don't think he's going to forget about you don't think he's going to draw you right here to the baptism of the holy ghost and the things of god and the promises of god that say that's it we're all done and we're all finished no he's still pulling he's still drawing amen he's still calling when god speaks it begins to pull the light begins to go forth it's good as finished right then so he goes on he says so how in the world are you going to stamp out the baptism of the holy ghost how in the world are you going to stamp out all the gifts how are you going to stamp out the church you can't do it god spoke it it's going to be it's settled certainly it'll materialize somewhere in someone then when god foresaw by his foreknowledge how he redeemed the world of sin and corruption he slayed christ before the foundation of the world when he spoke the word four thousand years before it was manifested so what are you scared about what are you afraid to take his word don't be afraid call the thing right i'm an heir why are you in there because i've been made in there through christ jesus not because i'm worthy enough but because he's worthy enough i am in here oh i don't you say i know i don't deserve it but i'm an heir i receive it there you are i am an heir of the holy spirit i am an heir of salvation i am an heir of the holy ghost i am an heir of healing and deliverance that is my portion given by the blood of jesus christ i'm an heir to old perfect assurance jesus of mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine an heir of salvation satan can't stand that but let me tell you he's a defeated being he's tried to stop it but he's nothing but a bluff jesus paid the price and he called us by his grace with an heir what a perfect set up that is he's already defeated i didn't have to defeat him christ defeated him i'm just claiming my own god-given privileges that's all i have to do brother brandon would talk about a little man says a little color man was being ordained one day and the elder stand around said lord wrap him up in burlup sacks pour carousing on him and set him a fire for the gospel he said that's what we need today is on fire turn him loose and let him run he said i used to brand calves we'd take a calf i know you've roped and hogtied many one i guess we used to brand them down someone said to me aren't you ashamed to pack that iron and stick it to his side as a note i stuck it on the side he had a kicking fit he squalled and battled he turned loose he had a spasm boy he could run but he always knew he who he belonged to from then on as long as he lived i tell you brother it takes a lot of grace to come up to the altar and stay there till the holy ghost burns a seal down in you you may scream he may cry you may act funny but you know who you belong to from then on for you're sealed into the kingdom of god by the holy spirit remember the holy spirit came to seal those who god foreknew who he called he didn't just come down jesus and say i'll die maybe somebody'll have pity and look on me and say well i suppose maybe if they think i've suffered so much it'll break their hearts and they'll come no no you won't you wouldn't come anyhow no matter how sad it looked there's plenty of people that watched the crucifixion that what was the name of that one the passion and saul the how they portrayed it and walked away from there maybe said i'll never do something or maybe didn't even never feel nothing it wasn't going to be good enough to just go up there and die maybe maybe if i suffered enough it'll break their hearts and they'll come no we're pigs born in a manure pile he can just tell you right quick if he could talk i'll tend to my business and you tend to yours that's what a pig would say oh yeah we got pigs in church don't get on that preacher that ain't none of your business maybe it ain't the preacher maybe it's god but it takes a conversion god has to do it no man can come to jesus except god draw him first it takes the work of the holy spirit to even turn your heart it takes god someone said i sought god and i saw no no god is seeking you you're not seeking god god is seeking you all right the holy spirit is just doesn't just come in and take any kind of wife doesn't just come take somebody's smoke somebody drink somebody lives immoral somebody carries along with all kind of worldly things because he said if you love the world and the things of the world the love of god is not even in you but the holy spirit comes in the seal and the body the wife of jesus christ that he foreknew before the foundation of the world by being god by by him being god in foreknowledge he could see who would receive him and who will not receive him amen so the holy spirit comes to get that bride that's the one he takes in notice he said it's cause it's by the holy ghost i love this part it's got it's kind of tickled me blessed me because last last wednesday you know i sing that song i'm bound for the nursing home i figured somebody to try to say as being sacrilegious well i won't let you know brother branham did that too i found it today he said they used to sing a little song come and dime he said but we changed it up a little saying a little different he said forgive me if i stumble you come and join the pastor calleth come and join you can have your ice cream suppers all the time tell all the dirty chokes chair a cud and puff of smoke oh the pastor calls the congregation come and join god is not wanting us to join he's wanting us to dine to feed on the lamb to feed on his body to restrain free street receive strength from his spirit to be changed to come and not remain the same you know we get the song just as i am without one plea we sing that and they sing it for many years just lord gonna take me just as i am saying i'm not gonna change he's just gonna be a creator i'm gonna say i'm a christian i'm gonna confess the lord jesus christ i'm gonna be saved but i'm to remain the same that i am because he's going to take me just as i am god wants more than just as you are why would he call you out of mud for you to remain in mud why would he call you from being a pig for you to still live like a pig what a difference take a man as long as he got a little money can pay and put him put him on the deacon board got two or three wives don't matter they're influential men in the city i don't care if the city hates them i want them influential in heaven where the holy spirit is where they can have some influence among the people but it's just come and join he said i asked a girl sometime i go are you a christian she said i have you to understand i'm an american like that has anything to do with it she was in switzerland like that had anything to do with brother bob's worth ask a woman one time i'll give you to understand i'll burn a candle every night now like that has anything to do with god i want you to be born again and he's calling you out of that life of sin god is calling and looking for his own his voice has a purpose it's it's not just a broad as far as a broadcast yeah so he'd love to see the whole world say but it's going to very specific places and very specific people we read about in genesis 1 and verse 2 and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters amen in the word was the beginning the word was with god and the word was god that word was a thought expressed but that thought expressed became a word and went out let there be but the spirit of god was sent to make sure it was fulfilled amen he says he said may i go on record when that word goes out there isn't enough power and hell that can ever defeat the purpose of god god will do it anyhow see god put seeds in darkness he put seeds upon that formless earth and with avoided earth and full of just covered with chaos and water but why would he throw his seeds in such a place why would he put him in such darkness and such chaos why would he put him there because he knew his power to draw them out was greater than the power of darkness to keep them hallelujah why would he put seeds in laodicea in the darkest ages ever been because he knows his power to draw them out is greater than the power to keep them there and he'll draw him out of every walk of life he'll draw him out of the streets and off the off the highways and the byways his word is going to go forth and it will bring forth the people of bride for this age and it's doing so even now god looked over this bleak earth it wasn't nothing but one great big ball of turmoil and water and chaos and god sent the holy spirit to the earth the logos that light that went out of god and it began to brood over the earth now the word brood means to make love or to coo like a dove he said let there be life and that light went out and he began to put his wings brother around said we draw a picture like a big big two big wings that just put their arms around the earth and they go cool and in that darkness with seeds in that darkness was and that chaos seemed like nothingness it began to bring it to peace and tranquility with his arms wrapped around the earth it bring began to bring it to out of chaos and began to bring creation upon the earth and it was cool and it was brood and it was bringing and he said it's the same thing when the word goes forth amen the holy spirit is there to wrap his arms around somebody amen it word knows where it's sent to amen the word is goes out it's not just sent out for just any reason the word is always for a purpose amen a man who preaches something that don't just get up and say well i'm just going to come up here and just say some things you know but god has begun to deal on his heart for specific things and god begins to pull this one off of that one and that one out of this job and that one thought they couldn't make it to church that night thought there wasn't no way but all of a sudden someone said i got to get to church i got to be there i i can't miss tonight i i want to receive something i got something in store i feel it what was it it's the cool of the holy spirit it knows what is vixen to come forth therefore it begins to prepare a bedding ground it begins to prepare a place for the word to have preeminence for the word to be fulfilled amen and that's that's why when you feel that tug and you feel that brother branham said i'll tell you what brother brown said he said if you've got the holy ghost when the doors are open that tug is too great for you to stay home amen it'll be a pull it'll pull you it'll draw you it'll it'll come and you'll come sometimes in your work clothes you'll come without a shower that's not what it's all about anyway i want to hear from god i want to receive something from god i want to see who i am i want to see where he's doing what he's doing and the holy spirit this whole time there if you could see him at work he's had his wings wrapped around you and you're going through hell seems like and you're going through turmoil and your life seems to be flipped around and the holy spirit's i'm bringing something out of this situation just hang with me i'm going to bring something out of this moment just stay with me whoo god pulling the light drawing something out of your life out of the darkness that's around you he said i want to make this mental picture we're going to make it like wings there's great wings around the earth brooding making love cool come come come the father has ordained you come the father has called you come the father has placed you in a position come he said i hope that's sinking in he said it ain't just there cooing anymore it's right here tonight saying come there's more for you come drink of water what called that woman to the well there was a man sitting there on that well he said i had need to go to samaria and his disciples said well what what good and what's in samaria well it happened to be a little soul down there that was covered in a lot of darkness but those words went out i got a need to go that need was her and that word went to that need and began to pull her began to call her maybe she wasn't going to go to the well that day i don't know maybe she was just going to do it later but at that moment something began to move on the inside of her and it began to pull her to that place what was it that word went out but the word don't just go out it's accompanied by the spirit of god and it began to pull that woman out of the place that she was in into the presence of almighty god oh hallelujah don't you realize what's happening on a wednesday or a sunday or when you get in your car and you feel i got to listen to this tattoo and take i got to do this i got to read my bible it's the cooling of the holy ghost trying to pull something out of your life trying to pull fruit trying to pull flowers trying to pull life after the while petroleum started coming up a little bit of this little easter lily all of a sudden popped out of the ground holy spirit cooing a dahlia come up in azalea it must have been somewhere around louisiana other bushes then along came visitation vegetation the holy spirit brought in then after that vegetation came trees and plant life afterwards birds began to come out of the dust of the earth the holy spirit brooding them together sent them into the air then came along animal life out of that dust stepped forth a line out of that dust stepped forth an elephant out of that dust death throat everything that was in the mind of god that holy spirit was brooding it out of that earth after a while came human life and all of our bodies was laying right there in the earth at that day but it wasn't time yet for your seed to come up it wasn't time for you to come into manifestation he had a specific time that he wanted this specific specie to come at a specific time so it could be able to withstand its surroundings do you know they do that they they make seeds you know man just perverts call it hybrids anybody's doing it for a reason he's not doing it just to try to maybe just maybe some of them do but they're really looking amen to see if they can make it maybe weather resistant or bug resistant or you know parasite resistant or or or to make it where it'd be more healthy and invite in this climate or in this environment they're trying to make it where they can you know maybe maybe let's just say citrus or something couldn't grow in a certain area so they tried to change it a little bit so it could grow in that area but god didn't do it by perversion he did it by conversion and he knew i have seeds laying there that are going to be powerful enough to withstand everything the devil has to have offered them amen and i'm going to bring them up at a certain time nope it ain't their time yet right now it's adam's time right now it's eve's time right now it's at abel's time right now it's moses or abraham's time right now moses time and right now and it keeps coming and keeping them all the way and even brother brown said that holy spirit began to brood a blood cell to where it created a blood cell inside of a little virgin to bring forth his own body that he could live in amen what was it he's brood and he's calling he's bringing them up out of the dust of the earth amen out of the place of darkness out of the place of chaos out of the place of impossibilities god the holy spirit is saying hey what i've got is greater than what's holding them the drawing power is that's able to draw them out of the darkness you can see it you can see when concrete's covering a seed of grass even if that seed is ordained to life it'll crack concrete i've seen a picture one time of a tree that burst open a rock and came how many has ever seen that picture is pretty popular came right up through a rock what was it that seed was ordained to life and there wasn't enough that could be put on top of it to keep it to come into life that ought to give us some victory tonight amen maybe maybe we ain't seen those seeds come up but just give the holy spirit time he's still wooing he's still calling he's still bringing them he's still calling them he's still cooing and one day that seed is going to come to life so don't ever give up hope it don't matter how dark it is it doesn't matter how deep they may sing it doesn't matter how far off they may be amen if they are ordained to life and i believe my children are i don't know about you but i believe my children are because i said the promise is unto me and my children hallelujah amen so it doesn't matter how much gets on top of them and how deep they seem to be covered but when that sun begins to pull on their life they can be in a drug house somewhere they can be in a bar room somehow they can be in a wherever even in the darkest of the four corners of the earth but that's the holy spirit begins to wrap his arms around cool cool cool because he knows what's calling is greater than what's holding. he knows where his seeds are he's not like humanity that can forget and just say well i lost him i don't know where i put them i don't know about you but that's pretty easy to do nowadays if you've got something you're trying to put up somewhere and you put it up too good like man i just saw that the other day what'd i do with it where did i put it anyway and i heard this statement many times as a kid well if it had been a snake it bit you you're looking and you're looking right up god doesn't do that he knows where you're at he knows he's not forgot one of his he said could a mother forget a suckling child maybe maybe so but i'll never forget you because your names are engraved in the palms of my hands he knows where you're at he knows what it takes he knows how how to get you to the place you're at america place you need to be hey man look at this amen the father is drawing he's calling amen he's calling the seeds to life let me go on down for a minute he said he would brood until adam would come out someone he could fellowship with someone in his own image someone in his own likeness and he said there was nothing greater for the father that and he loved to do was to come down in the evening time and say adam my child did you have a good day today did you have a good time how was your day tell me about it tell me what you've been going through tell me how you dressed the garden today tell me where you put things yeah that's exactly how i'd have done it fellowshipping was something in him a desire to fellowship and this is what he's doing in this age in this time he's drawing a people to a place of fellowship it's the drawing power of the light he wants to come down to you and say how's your day going what you've been through my child cooing let me help you with that let me take your burdens let me load lighten your load just come to me just come you don't have to stay there you don't have to stay in that doubt and fear let me take it you don't have to stay in that depression let me have it you don't have to stay in that situation you're in i got something better for you i'm the ever-present help in the time of trouble i'm your god and he's cooing and he's wooing and he's telling you service after service after service just ask and you'll receive come on just ask just ask that your joys may be full just ask that you can receive so just ask me he's calling just ask lord i need you that's all he wants lord i got this situation can you help me with it and he's pulling and he's wooing it's the drawing power of light he's calling you out of that dark spot in that dark place just this past camp is to give you a personal testimony musicians can come went through a very difficult time as you all know start even over over into 2020 where my wife would be put in the hospital and uh with uh coven come very close to dying closer closer than i ever wanted her to and then that same week not getting much sleep with her in the hospital and me at home and same week i'd get woke up in the early morning by phone call from my father my mother was having a seizure we didn't know what it was so for for weeks and months months months wasn't able to rest because of those traumatic things had gotten a few phone calls from ruth

the burden that was there and the pain that was there and the heartache was there it was just someone's crushing other things would go on it would even add to the burden and the crushing but on

moment and i want to thank him for it sometimes you think it's just yourself it ain't just you it's god pulling is god calling is god moving you think well i'm just gonna go no it's god moving behind the scenes to because he wants to minister to you let's buy our hands it takes the brooding of the holy spirit to bring in the fellowship of god to give you eternal life you say well i'm a great
