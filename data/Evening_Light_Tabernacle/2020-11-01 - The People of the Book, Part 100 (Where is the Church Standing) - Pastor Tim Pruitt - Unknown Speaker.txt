what a merciful wonderful god that we serve and is here with us even to the end of the world as promised amen we're here in the last days i believe this is the last stage we've received the last messenger and it's going home time it is a little quote that brother kelly hildebrand shared today i thought i would read it um as we begin today god we would pray now for this great nation of ours that's in the time of the changing of presidents it might seem like a light thing but god it might change the destination of this nation oh lord thou who would choose the prophets and anoint the kings we pray your holy spirit will anoint the right man for us in this hour granted lord where the great rallies are going on on both parties father we realize you're not interested in parties it's man that you it's a man that you can trust so i pray father that somewhere along that they'll choose the right man for the hour we know that the hour has come when the wrong man will be chosen chosen to so we pray father that you'll give us a little more time to bring in the lost you know i think that's the desire of every true christian let's find that last one when that last one is found and his name is dipped in blood he's going to be going home time a rapture promised error the book will be closed it'll be finished then but somewhere somehow and at some time we're going to be praying the last prayer prayed in the bible which says he which testifies these things sayeth surely i come quickly amen and here's the prayer even so come lord jesus here this past week we've lost a couple of friends um brother c.w woods has passed away he was a pastor up in uh mid-arkansas there and down at the edge of arkansas here um as a family lost a mother and a grandmother pastor's wife sister betty harbor passed away this wednesday she and her husband brother don they um i have pastored a little work up there for many years just in the over in the edge of arkansas and um they were friends of our family for many years probably 60 years almost and we have two of their her granddaughters that attend the evening light tabernacle sarah and paul fields and amy and micah mitchell and we just want to remember that family in prayer today thank god for this life that that he sent along the way that has been a stepping stone for many you know the past of life brother branham said footprints on the sands of time you would quote from the point and we all leave some kind of footprints along the way and so god help us to walk the straight and narrow amen we don't know how many more days we will be here upon the earth but we want to make what time we're here count for god so let's just bow our heads together father as we bow our heads and think about these soldiers that's one on the head of us brother wood who has wrote many papers and sent him around he loves you and tried his best lord in his own way to spread the gospel with his understanding and knowledge that he had and then there was sister harbor that we've known for many many years was a friend of my mother and dad and lord we in the early days shared tapes with one another borrowed and copied and shared and talked so excitedly about what you were doing in our day and hour today lord their family experiences a loss and we just ask lord your blessings upon them upon brother don and cindy and danny and stephen lord i pray that you'll give comfort and strength to them in this hour in this time the grandchildren as well lord each family member and church family god bless them i pray and just just let your grace shine upon them ever need supply now lord we pray that you will bless us in the service today as we just drop the armor a little tighter and we go forward in your name and we look forward lord to the promises of god and knowing that it's true and that you will never leave us or forsake us and we're asking that you'll be with us now in jesus name bless the word as we read it as we share with one another may you anoint us by your holy spirit give us a hearing ear and a receiving heart the ability oh god to hear what the spirit said to the church we ask it in jesus name amen amen god bless you thank you and certainly appreciate the lord today and the privilege that we have of serving him and you know one thing about it is god's always constant he never changes times changes presidents will change uh seasons will change but god never changes and one thing about him he never fails amen it's good to see each one of you that are here sister gina nice to see you today happy to have you in service and and caught a glimpse of little hannah micah michael's sister here with us from arizona so god bless you each one that is assembled with us may he just pour out his blessings upon you amen in a mighty way today hosea chapter 10 and verse 12. i'm going to be speaking today on where is the church standing and i take that from a quotation of brother branham's where that um he he uses this very phrase and i just wanted to look at it today that the lord will help us and minister to us so hosea chapter 10 and verse 12 sow to yourselves in righteousness reap and mercy break up your fallow ground for it is time to seek the lord till he come and reign righteousness upon you amen may god bless you can be seated where is the church standing i mean here we are on the eve of an election coming up and you know whichever way that things go there things are not going to remain the same we're living in a time of great change where things are happening and so the life that we knew before before this coveted struck we'll never know that life again it's uh it's a change it's something that has taken place in this time and and um we need to prepare to to meet the lord it's um it is that hour and um you i hear brother madam saying i want to see a church in position and uh and so we are asking where is the church standing or what is our position in this hour in time i remember him speaking about this in the adoption message and he would he would urge us to go back to genesis back to the original where that the world is now groaning and travailing in pain into now and um crying for deliverance and everything is calling for the manifestation or the revealing of the sons of god and these sons he said were true sons born sons field sons speak and their words is back and i believe we're on the border of it right now yes sir say to this mountain let it be so brother i desire a certain thing done i'm a believer in jesus christ i'll i'll give it to you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen there's a manifestation my brother my crops are burning up out yonder i haven't had any rain i send you rain in the name of the lord and bless your crop awaiting groaning all nature waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god god ordained it at the beginning he gave man that domain he gave jesus christ and jesus gave it in his name with this assurance ask the father anything in my name and i'll do it oh brother waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god the position the church as i said the book of ephesians the book of joshua and joshua's placing the people where they belong and if they wouldn't stand still he'd put them here and and said he'd run over to manassas land and this one would come back fussing and stewing and how are they ever going to get along one says i'm baptist i'm methodist i'm pentecostal i'm one of some twoness i'm so and so how are you going to do it god's wanting to place his church sons and daughters of god and he said let me live to see it this was his prayer let me live to see it he said i can just it's so close i can just feel it with my hands almost look like it's right there and i've longed to see it waiting for the time when walk down the street and there lays a triple a in there and from his mother's womb silver and gold and by none or waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god hallelujah when they'll when god will make himself known when they'll stop sickness they'll stop cancer they'll stop diseases you think cancer is something that the bible said there's coming a time that men will rot in their right in their flesh and the buzzards will eat off the carcasses before they even die and cancer's a toothache to what's it coming but remember that horrible thing was forbidden in that day to touch those that had the seal of god and that's what we're striving for now is get in and be positionally placed into the kingdom of god before these horrible plagues strike oh my he's so here we are he's asking the question where are we standing felt like he was on the brink or on the edge of it said it's so close even now that i could almost seem like feel it with my hands and i'd say where are we standing where has god positioned us at you know what is the blood done for us when a bloody lamb stepped forth to take the book and to lose its seals and confers the title upon us you see adam before the fall was in position as a son of god and he operated uh in faith and with the power and authority of all of heaven behind him and he spoke and trees moved and he commanded and winds obeyed he exercised his rights over the animals and called them by name and whatever he called them that was their name and then of course by satan coming in and deceiving eve because adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgressions of the bible then adam surrendered the title to everything earthly even his body and and so again that that forfeited title deed went back in the hands of almighty god and that's where it has remained until the day that we're living in when god and when heaven moves and this and the seals are open and the mysteries are revealed we're living in a very great hour we're right here at the closing of time for the bride of christ and and the beginning of eternity for her as she'll move from this dimension into the eternal dimension and the earth will go on in time of course into the millennium and a thousand years and finally come back into eternity itself but we we get to go before that time and i'm glad for that because i'm glad that we don't have to wait for the day for our eternity to begin to leave time and to go into eternity but he but again the title deed to earth and to eternal life when adam forfeited of course satan's dirty hands could not take it amen so it went back in the hands of the original owner god himself and there the title deed to eternal life when adam forfeited went back in the hands of god back into the hands of the owner and it was been waiting for redemption claims waiting for a time where that that would come as was pictured in the bible a bloody lamb that would step forth and claim the book for man and of course we're living in that time in that generation and and of course you may ask what is this title deed well it's an abstract it is a deed that because it is an abstract that's been cleared that that everything that was against it is all the debts and the liens and the claims against it and against us from claiming it has been wiped away what a place to be standing where the prophet could look out and say that you never did it in the first place but you're the sinless virtuous bride of jesus christ standing there and so you never did it in the first place what a place to stand what a place where the blood has made you to stand you see the the redemption of this book means that all legal possession to everything lost by adam and eve amen that it now comes back in our possession that we possess or we have the right to claim everything that adam lost including our immortality are you with me amen it's legal possession to the abstract title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that adam and eve lost you know adam couldn't make the requirement for redemption he had sinned and he had separated himself from god and was across the chasm a deep chasm and the fellowship was not there the camaraderie the the friendship the walking with god that he had had and experienced wasn't there any longer he had crossed the chasm he had lost he'd lost the ability to operate as a son of god he was still every bit human in fact he was more human because now he was not immortal in an immortal body but a mortal body and and so he needed redemption himself and he couldn't do it moses couldn't do it jeremiah couldn't do it any of the great prophets of the ages past could not do it amen so god wrapped himself in a blood cell and came and by the spoken word placed himself into the womb of a virgin and in the as that earth wrapped around him and built cells around him that here came god dressed in human flesh amen to pay the price of redemption to be the lamb so god portrays himself as a lamb and as a sacrifice the perpetuation and provides a blood that wipes away every stain of sin doing so when he was here and through his work at calvary he wiped out the debt of the old testament saints and they rose with him in a glorious triumph on the day of the resurrection those who were kept in abraham's bosom ascended with him and were raptured up with him amen the lord the the lord went up with the lord and and for the living although that the holy spirit had anointed men down to the ages and time and never had the holy spirit ever a bodhian man that were born in sin because god could not dwell in an unclean vessel so when he would come down in the past he would create a body out of the 16 elements and walk in it and appear to abraham is that right this is the way he would do and then he would just step out of that body he would go back to the dust and the way he would go again and he'd come again and appear to man again but this time god was doing something different he would wrap himself in first in the womb of a virgin and god would take on flesh is that right i want you to think on this flesh it was it was flesh that was cursed it was flesh that was mortal are you with me it was flesh that was that had not that that as the earth was had not been redeemed and god had cursed the earth that jesus wrapped himself god wrapped himself in cursed earth and he brought that obedient there at the river jordan and you know i'm not making this up you can find this in in the future home and other sermons like that that brother branham preaches he i'm not making this up god wrapped himself in cursed earth and he brought that earth down to jordan and he said from this earth i will start my redemption and with this one i will redeem the rest of them now thinking of that here was the living the death of the old testament saints had been cleared they rose and took on immortality they went from there and ascended with him but what about the living what about peter james and john and those who who were were not who were not translated what about them he had paid the debt for both the living and the dead is that right amen but they were instructed to go and wait in the upper room until they were empowered from on high are you with me now amen so there again never had the holy spirit abode in man until jesus christ and he came and abode with him and he said the holy ghost that i'll sin will abide with you forever it won't be like the prophets and the old testament will come down in an ark man and then and then lift and come down and anoint and lift and come down and anoint and lift but this one would abide with you forever [Applause] and there on the day of pentecost we we see something happening when god's newborn sons walked out of the upper room hallelujah filled with the holy ghost and it wasn't riches of gold and silver that they had but it was the riches of the power of the spoken word that the spirit would start speaking right out of them hallelujah amen as it first was manifested in them speaking out in languages as words came out of their mouths declaring the miracles of god in acts chapter 2 and verse 1 and when the day of pentecost was fully come there was all with one accord in one place with one mind one accord one passion oh my think of this now you know if that had a um if that had a voting paper to to fill out as to who was going to be the the next uh pontiff or next um the the next one that would reign as harriet or the governor if they were electing and whatever maybe everybody's maybe everybody's uh voting paper was filled out differently one like this one and one like that one and one this and one had this opinion and that opinion let me just tell you there was still they were still human it meant some still like apple pie and the other preferred cherry i mean they still had differences but they had one passion amen they were with one mind on something and what were they in agreement on they had a passion and that was to be a dude with power from on high that was their passion that was their drive that's why they gathered together amen oh god make that our passion amen the reason we gather the reason we come together amen is not to talk to politics or have our different ideas or each one is doctrine but everyone have that one passion that is to be filled with the holy ghost amen to see the spirit of god move in the church and give her the same passion to save drive the same ambition [Applause] just as they were crying out there for the coming of christ the holy spirit we ought to have a one passion one drive amen as we assemble together this morning amen even so come lord jesus come in this service a man come against us we have those that need the holy ghost we have those that need sanctification we have those that need to come to repentance we have those that needs a healing we have those that need deliverance from their selfishness from their pride from their sickness from their disease we need jesus if there was ever an hour we needed jesus it's this hour we need jesus it's not going to be the call to drive the passion and the reason for assembling together even this morning as they were assembling in the upper room amen amen it ought to be something a passion that outweighs every fear the way outweighs every other reasoning i want one thing i want to see jesus are you with me amen you know you know again i i pass churches on the way that are sitting empty because people are afraid of the kobe day and had church in nine months or ten months because they're afraid and there's reason for fear they're i mean you know there are those that have went to the hospital some have died many have died there's been it's an illness you don't want but i'll tell you what you're going you know it's going to come by your way and you might get it in church yeah you might you might get it camping yeah you might but it's coming by and you're going to need a healer you're going to need a healer you're going to need the miracle worker are you with me they had one passion luke 24 49 behold i send the promise of my father upon you but carry you in jerusalem until you be with endued with power from on high again this was their passion oh i could hear brother branham preaching it over again sirs we would see jesus i think that again is the cry that ought to be for us in every service says we would see jesus we want to see jesus in our prayers we want to see him in our songs we want to see him in our worship we want to see him in our preaching we want to see him in the reception of our preaching we need jesus there's never been a time even more important than this one for jesus thinking of it they were there again acts 1 and 4 being assembled together with them he commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence so again they were instructed as they were waiting with one accord verse 8 said jesus gave them these words but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me boats in jerusalem in judea and samaria into the outermost parts of the earth and then on the day of pentecost when the day of pentecost was fully come this is acts chapter 2 and verse 1. i want you to stop in for a moment because we are now in another time of pentecost now we're not azusa streets we're we're not trying to reproduce azusa street that is not our our purpose they were not the original and they were not the original vine they were another graft put on the tree but we're living the day where another pentecostal branch must come up out of that root i want to say that's exactly what god has produced in this day but don't let it be like when jesus came looking for fruit and found none he cursed it because this is a time where god is expecting the fruit the same life the same power the same holy ghost the same spirit of god are you with me amen notice they were on when the day of pentecost was fully come they had come down through seven weeks of feast days where they came from the passover and they marked seven weeks from the from the day of the unleavened bread until until pentecost and when it had fully come when the seven weeks had come to its end this is where we're at we're not even at the beginning of the last church age we're at the end of the time in the beginning of eternity we're right here on the brink of every scripture that has been prophesied to be fulfilled in this hour that's where we're standing i mean we're we're here with the in the last days little children this is where we're at amen and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all in one accord in one place amen i'd like to see the church in one place i don't mean in this building i don't mean in louisiana i don't mean in the united states i don't mean one place in the world somewhere and all gathered here there there like some cult gathering that's not what i'm talking about but when i would like to see us all in one place that means is that we see our place in the scripture that we understand that we're here in the fulfillment of all the promises of god that even as jesus fulfilled the old testament we are living in the time and the day where we fulfill the new testament they were all with one accord they had one accord come holy spirit come sweet spirit there's a promise given to us and we want it and we're not leaving till we get it we're going to stay in this place we're going to stay in this position until we receive it somebody with me amen this is exactly where we are we are here in the fulfillment of scripture and we must stay steady we must look here you know you know you don't know what's going to be coming who can predict i can't predict will there be riots break out in the street where there be pandemonium everywhere where there be militias and fighting and wars and and civil war i don't know what's coming nobody else does either god holds it in his hands and it really doesn't matter what they do out there what are you doing we're a winner either way we can't lose amen no matter who wins in the white house we can't lose amen again i'm praying that the man that will be the one that will will usher in the end time the one that god has ordained that he steps into place whoever that is now but anyway when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord and one place and again i want to i want to go back over it again just to drill it into you we want to see that they were told to gather at a place but you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come you shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence all of these words that have been spoken to them stay there carrying the city of jerusalem till you be endued with power from on high now we're not waiting on the holy ghost to come he's already come he's already here even the pillar of fire people said well where is it brother branham said and brother branham said and i didn't bring the quote with me today but he says he he said you know it's not me that that has the pillar of fire the pillar fires in the church it's in his people somebody help me preach that's where he is the pillar of fire is among us he hasn't left us as brother branham would say when i leave the city the holy spirit will not leave now brother brandon's been gone almost as long as he was here next year in 2021 he will be in in december he will be he will be gone as long as he was here upon the earth he's already been gone longer than what he ministered here on the earth and we're in overtime if he was saying back then that the coming of the lord is past due what about now amen so here here again this these are what they had one one accord was and what's got to be the one accord that we have what is the thing that we must be saying in our hearts now come on church you know that we're in the time of delay what men say that the lord has delayed his coming for since the prophets have fallen asleep all things remain as it was from the beginning you know it's in this time jesus predicted if we would have this time and he said the servants would begin to fight one another and beat one another so mother we and we've seen plenty of arguments and debates and everything else somebody helped me preach i mean this is a part of the time of delay and we started out on this and that was we we had a heart we were we wanted to see the coming of the lord but as time goes along what do we do now we're we're focusing more on tarion till he comes rather than his coming so more preparations are being made more thought is being put into how do we stay here how do we best survive things that are coming how do we prepare for what's coming and that's the wrong focus amen our hope is not on how we can fortify ourselves i know gun sales are out of the roof weapons and and ammo and preparations and plans and food and everything else is advertisement everybody buy this certain thing you know so you survive i'll tell you i'm not interested in surviving i'm interested in leaving [Applause] we got a crazy world out there and i don't want to stay with the crazies amen i want to leave with those who have their mind on christ and this is where that that it had to be a focus on day we're looking for his coming then the coming of the holy spirit which is jesus the spirit of jesus somebody with me we're looking for the coming of jesus amen hallelujah and we know we know before he materializes in the sky and we meet him in the air that he's first got to be seen in a bright body [Applause] amen there's been the groom coming 2000 years ago and of course we look to the meeting in the air but he's not coming to the earth we meet him in the air but on earth there's got to be a coming and that's a bride of people who have made themselves ready are people who know their god and do some exploits people who are under expectation for his coming well i'll tell you when people get their eyes on his coming and they prepare for his coming there's no divorces in the church there's no fighting in the home there's no rebellion come on amen sin goes out to out the door because people's harder on the coming but when people get their eyes off the coming and they get their eyes on carrying and that the lord has delayed his coming somebody with me amen and it just seemed like it was going to go on and on and on and on hey friends there comes a time where that everything wraps up and the bible prophesied it would be this and here we are in this day this time and we're standing at a particular place amen where that scripture is being fulfilled right here in this hour and we got to recognize where we're standing and have the one mind the one accord on the right thing here again when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly you know things happen suddenly suddenly we hear about a virus that will change our lives suddenly they they will say peace and safety and suddenly destruction will come right here while you've been sleeping you know one accord after accord has been done with israel amen never has been a time where where they could ever dream that there would be peace with israel and acceptance and they're they're signing them on board one after another after another is somebody with me remember but when they can say peace and safety then comes sudden let me tell you about the rapture just for a minute you think you're going to have a lot of warning about the rapture that they're just going to be you know everybody in this euphoria and whatever i'll tell you what in many ways it'll be just like another day and the only way you're going to know it is if you're walking with him just like you do every day serving him just like you do every day praying just like you do every day living for him just like you do every day you see by the time you find out what's going on it's going to be too late you got to be in tune now enough walked with god he got into position and he stepped into that position and it went long he was changed now and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance verse 11. creates an arabian we do hear them in our speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god so their mouths were were not just jabbering something they were saying something and when the feasts of weeks were fulfilled they were here in one accord in the upper room and suddenly comes a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind it fills the house and there appeared to them a pillar of fire the same one that was with moses is now come to leave the church amen the same one that was down down to the ages here he was to lead the church the same one that was seen by saul on the road to damascus that said i am in jesus whom you persecute jesus had returned but not in the corporal body but in his holy spirit and the sound as it came was a roar like a rushing mighty wind and a whirling ball of fire came into the room and licks uh portions of that fire began to spread out from it and separate and come and and it would fling out here and it would fall on this one and it would fall on that one and fall on that one until all they were in the house 120 of them were filled with the holy ghost and out of their mouths came words declaring the wonderful works of god expressed now in many different languages the curse of babylon with his confusion of language was reversed on that day amen when one heavenly language that was understood in every tongue and dialect because god would be having a bride out of every kindred tongue nation tribe and people and they would all speak one language hallelujah these words that brought amazement and conviction to some and mockery from others you know everybody has mixed reactions you get mockery from some amazement from others conviction from more amen and it must have spilled out into the street amen because soon there was a crowd of god-fearing jews who came to jerusalem from every nation under heaven and they when they heard the sound a crowd came together and and they were bewildered and astonished because each one heard in their own language it being spoken declaring the wonderful works and the miraculous power of god amen now the bride is not in jerusalem alone there might be somebody there amen you know it's not in in one local long she's all over the world are you with me amen but every place must come to the position where they are declaring the wonderful works of god hallelujah he healed cancer he healed alopecia he healed stomach trouble he healed eye trouble kidney trouble this that and the other whatever it is he changed my life the wonderful works of god spoken every assembly that's why we got to see church we've had a lot of theology and fussing and fighting and everything else but what we need is the people to be able to say god is with us he's the healer he's the same yesterday today and forever my god reigns he's there over every situation amen he'll never leave us or forsake us of people who know their god now others mocked saying these are drunk on some sort of new or strange wine don't forget the rapture hour is one of the most times of mockery that there's ever been with the coming of the lord the bible said that scoffers shall arise saying where is the sign of his coming and brother branham when he preaches the rapture message his the first half of his sermon is on the scoffers amen so don't think you're going to get by this unscathed that you're not scoffed at and mocked and ridiculed don't think young people that you can go through this and not be ridiculed and made fun of and called old-fashioned or whatever word you're just not cool or whatever word there is are you with me it's part of the coming and living in this day when you see the mockery now that's even made against the message of the hour understand it's part of the rapture message there has to be scoffers in place just like there had to be sodomites in the days of lot these people each one have their place and they are finding their places some are finding their places as sodomites some are planting their places lord i'd see you know just good people lukewarm believers but some people are abraham's some people the mysteries have been revealed too some people have been told they're going to receive the promised son that's their message they're under expectation and some of those people are looking for the angel to come again come on sarah i will return to you according to the time of life amen we ought to be today in this building looking for the angel's appearance amen to tell us the time is here that we are in the hour we are in the time think of that but these others mocking saying these are drunk and peter stood up and words came out of his mouth amen some of these words were scriptures and these scriptures became anointed remember remember we're looking at something with a transformation here adam comes way back at the beginning he's made to be the god of the earth he has everything under his control everything is under his dominion by words he spoke and it happened he said let there be and it was he moved this tree by his words not sweat of the brow that came with the curse amen but with words somebody with me now amen and you don't think your words mean anything and you don't think your words don't have power hello somebody and here comes here comes the first thing that happens in the upper room is words and they're declaring god's among us they're declaring the wonderful miraculous power and works of god and then others begin to mock and and say how can this be they're drunk on wine an old crowd had gathered and peter said you know these people are not drunk as you're supposed this is only nine o'clock in the morning amen no but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel somebody with me now amen now what is it the light of that fire began to illuminate scripture and peter could say this day this scripture is fulfilled he can say this is where we're standing we're right here at joel's prophecy amen this is that in the last days saith god how many believes were in the last days and my brother branham would say these last days would cover 2000 years so we're in the last of the last days amen in the last days says god says i will pour out my spirit on all people started out there in jerusalem upon jewish people but it ends up on all people is that right amen your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your young men will see visions your old men will dream dreams even on my servants both men and women i will pour out my spirits in those days and they shall prophesy notice the words will come out of their mouth i want you to see words that have power words that will change things words that can create words that declare he's the same yesterday today and forever words that declare he's a miraculous almighty unchanging god words amen he would quote also from the psalms a couple of places to give scriptural proof of the resurrection of the messiah as the light of that fire began to give these scriptures their true meaning understand they had been misinterpreted for years and years and years but now it when the spirit came when the anointing came when the fire fell it illuminated the word amen oh my then he would then he would talk about the messiah and point him in the scripture and he said therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices and my body also shall rest in hope because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead you will not let your holy one seek corruption amen you have made me to know you have made known to me the past of life you will fill me with joy in your presence this word countenance is your face your presence amen thou has made known to me the ways of life listen when the holy ghost comes that's what it does it makes no to you the ways of life amen it makes you full of joy in his presence hallelujah amen oh my that a people could realize we're in the hour and a time that there should be more joy than ever there should be a rejoicing going on we're in the end time we're in the last days even so come lord jesus come whatever you do is i often pray don't leave us here now these supernaturally inspired words and the influence of these words would never stop i want you to understand they never stop and they will never stop until every predestinated preordained son of god is filled with joy in his presence amen it would continue to that day from pentecost to the end of the world let me tell you today you can make he'll make known to you the path of life he'll show you who you were before the world began he'll show you you were in his thinking come on amen that you're hearing time doing what you did in eternity in his mind because in his mind he saw you shouting and rejoicing over every trial over every problem over every situation somebody helped me preach amen he's already seen you in victory so now how can i be defeated when he the vision has already seen me overcoming death hell in the grave sin sickness disease [Applause] he will show you the path of life he will make known the joy of thy presence oh brother there's nothing like the joy of his presence nothing like it the bible said in his presence is the fullness of joy is that right amen so so again that shall make know the joy of his presence i i'll read you something here in a minute maybe i can maybe i can just scroll down here and find it but i've got a little quotation where brother madam talks about that let me just we'll just pick it up as we go but anyway as we're talking about this here here he's he is saying you know what you're seeing is not drunk men but you're seeing men who are who are anointed and filled and intoxicated with another spirit it ain't the spirit of wine it's the spirit of the god it's the holy ghost and it's anointing you hallelujah oh listen to me listen to this as he as as peter began to say these supernaturally inspired words these he's speaking life changing words life empowering words words that was received in the heart will change that heart forever peter speaking with these words it was not only that the beam of that fire was beaming or shining its light upon men but now it gives inspiration to a preacher is that right and peter began to preach and the light of that pillar of fire shown upon the scripture that it lay dormant for ages and revelation came to scripture that was being fulfilled in that hour and he said what you're seeing is not drunk men men under influence are intoxicated but rather men uh that where that are received the pouring out of the spirit of jesus whom you have crucified and who has ascended and he's poured out his spirit upon all flesh and he would describe him you know he said david said he would god would not leave him a descendant that didn't sit on the throne and he said here christ has ascended and he send it to the right hand of god and he reigns and he sent back his spirit in verse 29 he would tell them about this he said you know fellow israelites i can tell you this confidentially that this patriarch david died and was buried and his tomb is with us to this day but he swore with an oath god swore to him with the oath that there would that he would place one of his descendants upon his throne and he said seeing what was coming he spoke of the resurrection and the messiah that he was not going to abandon his body in the realm of the dead or neither would he see his body decay and he says god has raised up jesus to life and we're all witnesses of it he exalted him to the right hand of god and he's received from the father the promise of the holy spirit and he's poured it out upon you and that's what you're seeing and hearing for he said david had not ascended to heaven yet he said the lord said to my lord sit in my right hand till i make your enemies a footstool for your feet therefore let all israel be assured of this that god has made this jesus whom you crucified both the lord and christ now as christ the messiah he's pouring out his spirit he's pouring it out from his throne on high his own holy spirit i want you to get this not a second person not a third person the but the very spirit the very life of jesus is being poured out the very character of jesus is being poured out and it fills every one of those with the holy spirit and as the bible said that they were there they begin to testify or witness they begin to speak of the wonderful works of god this is what the holy ghost will do people look for this evidence for that evidence let me tell you what it will do it will cause your life it will speak out of your life the wonderful works of god he's my healer he's my deliverer he's my savior i once was lost in sin i was a smoker i was a drunkard i was a doper i was a thief that's what i was but that's not what i am because a miracle has taken place and has changed me from death into life no more will it tell the awful deeds of deniers betrayers liars thieves dopers adulterers smokers or drinkers but rather the life will tell the wonderful works of god this spirit will not display intellectual voices and words of man it will not spout out the egotism of man i came from baylor from bob jones i learned this from the upci i got this from the assembly of god but rather men that are ignorant and unlearned like peter the fisherman was was that he would have the scripture illuminated to him so much that others had known would know this man had been with jesus and let me tell you it was not it would not be a dry lecture i don't know where we get it in the message you know a rise of these dry lectures people men that never know the anointing never know the moving of the spirit of god you see that's not what was on the day of pentecost that's not what happened anywhere you know again an anointed preacher why a few days after this he was at they were at the temple gate and they saw a very broken piece of humanity a man who was born with a birth defect with club feet his feet and his ankle bones were so weak and twisted that he was hideously and hopelessly crippled he was born that way and he was considered accursed it was thought that a person who had afflictions like these were or were cursed with a generational curse because of some sin that his mom and dad did or his grandparents did or his great-grandparents did and he lived under that i'm cursed i'm rejected i'll always be you know an eyesore something different something's wrong he existed on begging and asking arms of everybody to come by and and that day when when peter and james where john peter and john would come into to the gate called beautiful let me tell you something friend suddenly this man's life was about to be changed forever again suddenly they came from heaven a sound like a rusty mighty wind suddenly the lord will come sadly here we are in a day in a time where things are happening quickly quickly suddenly and suddenly here he is and he's standing in front of not just men but god men amen come on church you've never seen men like this because there'd never be a man like this there had been a man like this his name was jesus but now there were men like this amen this was not a man anointed this was a man who the spirit bowed in this was a man that power would come out of his mouth somebody help me preach amen and heal he he he asked he held out of his hand asking for silver or gold for alms for money ask for something and peter said to him we can only give people what we have come on some of you missed it went right over your head amen so we peter said we can only give you what we got amen he couldn't give him silver and gold he didn't have any but he had something and he said i can only give you what we got amen and i just want to say to the church you can't give people what you don't have amen many of these backslidden churches sitting out there you can't give the holy ghost if you don't got it you can't give divine healing if you don't have it hey man you can't give joy if you don't have joy you can't give peace if you don't have peace but oh there's a people that's got it hallelujah they know that joy they know that peace they know the healer and the healer isn't somebody that comes down once in a while the healer abides with him [Applause] they had something to give and the last day church has to be standing in the place in the position they have something to give too many churches are bankrupt too many christians are bankrupt amen but but peter had something and he looks at him and said we can only give you what we got now a few days before that they didn't have anything to give but now after receiving what they had received they had something to give how many's got the holy ghost this morning you got something to give don't hide it under a bushel don't be ashamed of it don't run scared of it you got something to give [Applause] amen it can change lives it can speak inspired words it can speak words of healing and life peter reached down and just helped him to his feet and said rise up and i want you to know using the power of creative restorative spoken word peter commanded him to rise up and walk and there was snaps and crackles and popping as his ankle bombs and his feet became straight and the bible said he went leaping and jumping and praising god amen oh god delivers from a bankrupt church amen you know today we can give silver and gold we'll help you with your hospital we'll do this we'll do this we'll do this we'll do this we can pull out we'll you know and the church has done that the catholic church has got saint jude's the methodist church has got lots of different hospitals including willis knighton there in in shreveport catholic church has got church has got has got hospitals everywhere that's what they have to give yes but the real church has got to have something real to give amen listen and he said rise up and use creative words look these were the this was the same power that adam used before the fall the same power is somebody with me the word operating with the same power that adam would say to this tree be plucked up and moved over there or he would call the animals down and bring peace or perhaps he would as in his rule he would rule and tell the wind peace be still but now here's a son of god and he's got creative words in his mouth and using the power of that creative restorative word he says to a crippled man who is hideously hopelessly crippled who has no faith but peter's got some because he's not bankrupt again god give us a church in this end time that's not bankrupt they got plenty of faith they believe god's word they put it to test they see it work is somebody with me amen so you would say i don't have peter i'm peter i don't have silver gold but what i do have i give you in the name of jesus christ and taking him by the right hand he helps him up and instantly his feet are and ankles become strong and he comes jumping and leaping and praising god and when the people saw him doing this they recognized him as the man who had sat at the gate and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him and they all gathered at him and peter said my friends why do you gaze at us as if we had the power to do this why does this even surprise you why do you stare at us like it's our own power or godliness that made this man walk by faith in the name of jesus this man who you see was made strong it is jesus name and faith that comes through him that has completely healed him as you can all see and then peter began to tell them but this is not just for us amen it's for everybody who will receive it you can be transformed by the renewing of your mind amen you can become a son of god a daughter of god amen and he said he and he he began to preach to them of how god had sent jesus and they had crucified him and rejected him and then in verse 19 he says repent you therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord amen so repent and turn to god that's what converted me turn to god turn around turn to god so your sins may be wiped out annihilated dipped in blood let the bleach take care of it wipe every molecule of sin until it changes until it lands back on the head of the accuser come on somebody amen until your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing the times of refreshing may come from the lord times of refreshing the way you prepare for it is you prepare it for it by repentance by turning to god by seeking him with your whole heart come on remember where we was talking about a while ago amen getting in that one accord get your mind on one thing i've got to have this one thing i must have jesus amen you know i'm sorry we cannot give you jesus magically he comes in your heart when you repent when you surrender when you yield to the holy spirit when you invite him into your life that's when he'll come amen notice when times of refreshing may come from the presence of the lord you know we can expect that every service we can expect that every day we can expect that every hour times of refreshing to come from the presence of the lord oh my the holy ghost is that refreshing amen oh my it is the rest how many knows it in the bible that that god set aside a day for a man to rest sure he did he also said an order that every male of the of the children of israel must be circumcised yeah it was to be a sign in the flesh that that seed the issue from that from that man was claimed by god as his people are you with me amen but we don't practice circumcision today do we you know why because we got a new circumcision a greater one it's a circumcision of the heart that cuts off the flesh but every male every person every man or woman who is not circumcised will perish that will be cut off you know i was reading in the bible when god gave this to abraham the other the other day i was reading i believe he was i believe he was 90 99 years old something like that israel was 12. this may be a little carnal but that hurt and i'm just going to say to you the longer you wait the more it's going to hurt somebody with me amen so surrender now surrender now amen you know you cover that this was to be a covenant with god where god was claiming and it you know it wasn't somebody ever that something everybody could see and neither is it in you it's something in the heart and everybody can't see it but god knows amen and everyone that don't receive it is cut off among his people is that right amen now there was a sabbath day it was a rest day of course man made it into law he made it to so strict until it became burdensome to bear it was made to give them a nice day of rest and they made it impossible when i went to israel a few years ago you know they had they had um with their elevators they had um the fast elevators had another elevator and on the sabbath day it it was programmed to stop at every floor so if you had ten floors to to climb you went one door open two door open three door open close four and you waited all that time because you couldn't dare push a button it would be sin to push a button and they made it things impossible god gave it to them and they actually crucified jesus over their ideas come on oh yeah a crucified jesus over over their legalism legalism will cause you to crucify jesus legalism of your do's and don'ts and everything's got to be just this way in this way this way and this way will cause you to reject the messiah it's only when you come into grace yes amen where it's no longer law there's somebody with me now but i want you to understand that that this was this time of refreshing would be a rest and it would replace the sabbath rest now there's people that still worship on saturday and they go to church on you know we we had a many years ago i um i used to show goats and and there was a lady orthodontist seventh day adventist and and uh you know she she uh was um uh she was a go on goats and was showing showing them at the place but she was seventh day adventist a sabbatarian and you know i i didn't show goats on sunday i'd pack up and go home well it convicted her so well i'm not going to show goats on saturday because that's the true sabbath and there i look at her with short hair painted halter top and shorts you know paint paint everywhere and i'm and i'm looking at her and she's trying to be holy she's trying to do something here you know where she gonna she gonna worship on saturday and and here here that was a type just like circumcision that had already been fulfilled because when you receive the holy ghost you enter into a sabbath rest you're no longer working for your salvation you don't have to struggle i i could just quit this or if i can quit that or if i can quit smoking if i can quit drinking if i if i could just quit you know i you know i want to but i can't i this is so aggravating you know what i have to stop at every floor you know all it all just vanishes away when you get the holy ghost you enter into a rest and you rest from your labors as god did from his and it brings a time of refreshing from the presence of the lord hallelujah and it's refreshing and many refreshing and every day is a refreshing because every day you're in a sabbath rest no more a slave to sin no more slave to fear no more slave unbelief you're free the bible said in isaiah 28 9 whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept and preceptive on precept line up online line up a line here little their little four with tamarind lips and another tongue will he speak to his people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is refreshing yet they were not here now he's speaking of israel now if you look at it on one side here he took and he said okay you won't let the land rest you won't honor things that i have put into place i tell you what i'm going to make it rest i'm going to take a strange tongue and a strange people they're going to carry you away captive into babylon and i'll give the land rest the sabbath rest i there will be a rest and and so he carried them away but they still wasn't here so one side that's the old testament and the application there but in this notice this whom shall he teach knowledge to whom shall he give the wisdom oh he said them that are weaned from the uh and made to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts and he said precept must be up on precept line up online hear a little but i tell you with stammering lips and other tongues will i speak to this people this is something brother branham preached and used about the holy ghost all the way to the end of his ministry you hardly hear it preached anymore but this is exactly the scripture he would go to he said with stammering lips and other tongue i will will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing amen yet i believe there's a people here that are here what the spirit is saying though the world will not receive it amen there's somebody going to listen amen when a church like this exists like this sin cannot stay in its midst amen not only is sin exposed but it's dealt with and is called out by the holy ghost amen this was a church in this indus in his purity listen to children we're living in a time where the devil is going about like a roaring lion amen looking for someone to devour you're to resist him did you hear those words you are to resist him you hear the things you see the things you know that are going on look at it it's there it's on your phone it's there on your computer it's there in the streets it's everywhere come on amen the devil is there prowls about like a roaring lion seeking those whom he may devour but resist him stand strong in the faith because you know the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings amen but look in that early church here they walk out of that upper room now here are men empowered like adam they are changing things are changing things are happening and they're walking out see a man with crippled they're declaring the mighty works of god and among them the devil tries to enter in and the bible tells you that when they had gathered all the believers were in one heart and one mind in fact the matter is they were a loving giving caring bunch of people it wasn't all about me and mine and our survival but they were also interested in the needs of others and they shared everything that they had and i'm not talking about a forced communism in a church or a cult movement i'm talking about the holy ghost leading every heart and having a genuine love and concern for one another amen and and so again the bible tells us that with great power the apostles continue to minister and testify of the resurrection of jesus christ and the god's grace was so powerfully at work among them all and and there was no needy people among them because from time to time those that had houses or land that would they they would sell them and they would bring their money from the sales laid at the apostles feet there was a i'm just simply saying there was a care and a love for one another a concern about the needs of others are you with me even joseph a a levite from cyprus that this the apostles called barnabas which means son of encouragement he sold a field that he owned and he brought the money and he laid it at the apostles feet there was no big ones or no little ones such a love and genuine concern for others what is mine is now ours and if there was a need there would be someone just sell a possession put it at the apostles feet there must have been a real sense among them that we're leaving for the rapture is imminent and we won't even need this now brother branham said it was actually the working the acts of the holy spirit he said anointed him that way he said because when the persecution came they had no place to to to go and shelter and they went out to the world and dispersed the gospel everywhere you see we get it in our minds that we are to store up provide for ourselves but when is when your mind's on the coming of the lord it isn't about you anymore it isn't about what we're going to possess here it's about one focus let's get ready to leave this is what i'm talking about where are we standing now we're at the culmination of the ages you say brother tim they weren't looking for the coming lord oh yes it was because even paul said you know beloved i'll show you a mystery amount he would say in first thessalonians 4 he said you know concerning those who are asleep i wouldn't just sorrow not for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel with the trump of god and we we that are alive and remain shall be changed to be like them is that right amen this was the cry this was the crux this was their message and i want to just say to you they could have been raptured they were they were a seed church and they could have been taken in the garner but god had other names on the book that had not been manifested on the earth and so instead of taking them in the gardener he planted them and they come up through luther and wesley and all the way back but i want to tell you we're about to see it again and behold i show you a mystery amen this is no longer a mystery this is a day of fulfillment this is a day where rapture is happening amen the word has come to a prophet as the lord descends with a shout with a message and a message came to a prophet of god and from that message it took flesh in the lives and hearts of the people and i'm talking to a living walking talking pride of people that's got something to say of the people that's got power in their words of people who know their god they didn't care about possessions they were writing songs and i cannot feel at home in this world anymore all of god is leaving on my mind he's coming soon he's coming soon and with joy we welcome his returning oh our lord is coming back to earth again and this became to be the cry of their heart come i don't want to be in a service you don't come jesus who wants to be in a church where jesus didn't come come on but one ananias and sapphira conspired against the lord they sold their property and kept back some just in case this new religion didn't work out you know it was their land they weren't required to give the sale of it they could have kept back they could keep back any part of it for themselves but they made a pretense of giving all how many times have we dealt with this kind of thing down through our walk people who made a pretense of having surrendered all they pretend and they pretended you know that they had given everything and thus in their deeds they lied to the holy ghost and god judged them for it you know there in that early church god laid the bodies of ananias sapphira in the path of every hypocrite who would seek to enter the church and here was people walking to the church now listen this is hardly any different from when they went into the new land here they come in the new land of the holy ghost and they're walking right now into the new land of the holy ghost the apostles were just like hundreds of years before israel had walked into a new land and here in this new land they were devoting everything to god you know what happened to the time where the church used to when the people of god used to devote everything their time yeah you know don't don't get in your mind at all i'm trying to get your money in your pocketbook i'm not worried i'm i'm not even concerned about that but what about it today they you know again where where christians used to have something they would pray all night they would call on god they'd make a full surrender of everything is somebody with me and here israel they go into the land and they devote everything they devote everything at jericho to god they declared it all holy and everything all the spoils would be would be given to god and achan and achan saw a babylonian garment and a wedge of gold and he caused israel to miserably fail somebody with me now now we come into the new land we come into the new land and then this new land the holy ghost is moving healings are taking place miracles are happening people are being filled with deity and in the midst satan puts in the heart here comes the devil coming in and here comes a hypocrite hypocrite it's kind of a bad word today you know we use it ah that's a hypocrite hypocrite in that day it was just an actor it was a greek word common name for an actor just like we say this actor or actress played on this movie or what this was a hypocrite hypocrite was an actor and jesus began to call them pharisees and sadducees you're just actors that's all you are is acting and they get in the new church now and i want you to know here the these make a pretense of giving their all right i tell you when we we're standing at a place right now where there there can't be pretenders we've got to be for real we can't just go along and play church it's a serious hour that we're in think of this words now begin spoken out of the mouth of a son of god that brings upon these sudden judgment suddenly the same word that brings life now brings death to imposters and pretenders i wonder if that's not where we're standing at where the very message that a rapture church will bring death to impostors and pretenders as i said god laid the bodies of anonymized sapphire in the path of every hypocrite as a reminder don't get in this church this will happen to every hypocrite now we're not you know in that as i want to go back over it again aiken as it go into the new land death comes on a pretender we come into this new land death comes upon the pretender both of them are now greed pretending hiding putting things away but this time like that time god's not letting them get by with it and we're living in a time of great judgment where god is not going to let people just get on by with pretending and play in church and just being actors you're going to be a sincere a man or you're not going to have the power to bind the serpent this is a time where it separates the men from the boys as it were for the same word that brings life brings depth imposters again this is not a return to the harshness of the old testament but rather when the church stands in its position a stern warning of the swift judgment follow sin amen you know again same thing happened there in with cyprus and the elements let me let me just stop there for a moment words come out of the mouth of a son of god word speaking i i want you to get something that what happened in the upper room empower the people like it did adam it put to them a clear deed and when you get the holy ghost you also have a clear deed and it puts you in the in the position of speaking and here he was speaking they were speaking the wonderful works of god now they're speaking again and and and a lame man walks and now he speaks again and out of his mouth says ananias ananias satan has put in your heart think of that satan has put this in your heart here people were being filled with the holy ghost and here's a man right in their midst that starts getting filled with satan and now begins here is he as he begins to to amplify the very spirit now of deception and he comes into the church now you know again again the way it was the way it was that that you know he he saw joseph called barnabas he saw him do it and you know it he wanted to be in the same status looked on with the same look so he comes out now it's his to give he could have kept back part of it only gave part amen he could have said peter i sold this for twenty thousand dollars and i've kept ten thousand my wife and i well we just didn't have the whatever the wherewithal to give it all we we want to give you the ten thousand that would have been acceptable but he lied he pretended to give all and laid it at the apostles feet and when he did when he did death struck him out of peter's mouth came words and he felt dead and here come as they bundled him up and took him out to burr to bury him here comes his wife in and said he gives her a chance he gives her a chance to repent to be truthful to be honest and he said did you really sell this for such and such yeah we did so well the men that came in that are walking in that just bared your husband will carry you out and down she fell what was it when the church stands in its position there's no more play in church anymore i want you to get this you know we we as a church should not look for members we should look for newborn christians to be born again and empowered by the spirit of god i mean not just associates that just come along and want to float with the crowd it's a time where pretenders have to drop away that if there ever was a time for people to be sincere and dedicated and consecrated it's now one of the last things brother branham said in the message communion he said you know the hour will soon arise when right among us will be the holy spirit will speak out like it did ananias sapphira remember that hour is arriving now you just remember that that god is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now god is going to dwell among us and with this holy god he don't want pretension listen it was this incident with another sapphire that would establish the authority of the church the keys of the kingdom was dares to use it was there to loose or to bind are you with me amen the holy spirit would reveal to peter the secret of sin and and and you know these that were you know looking like they were given everything they were generous but they were just given for this to the sake of status how often does that happen where that that people they actually do something they try to serve god for the purpose of status to be accepted how many a young girl has been ruined or a young boy has been ruined because the person that they were choosing was a pretender and for the status to be married to be attached to be accepted they pretended i'm telling you we're standing on the brink of eternity we're standing in a place it's a serious hour that we're in and and and these these people anonymized safari they were not outsiders and neither were they enemies of the church but they were a hindrance inside it and where we are standing the hindrance will leave so if you don't want on this holy ghost boat now you know i i can see question marks popping up over everybody's who in the world are you talking about i am preaching i'm not talking i'm not singling out one individual and this is not this is to you but it's not to you i'm saying this is a time where we are standing is a time of seriousness it's a time of dedication is it time of consecration it's a time when your joy must be the lord amen where that he becomes a place where you rest and that pretending is over with but that you're real and genuine i mean come on when we see things like this begin to happen and the holy spirit begin to move in such a way and we're here at the end time god's going to dwell among his people and where there's a holy god it will separate the unholiness among us because he circumcises the heart listen brother branham said in a total deliverance he said when the church shall come be completely delivered when everything comes under the blood when your sins come under the blood when you're smoking you're gambling you're cheating you're stealing when you're lying when everything is brought in the blood then there'll be a total deliverance if you're wrong somebody make it right you can't bring that under the blood it won't stay you can't bring it somebody something won't let you do it when when your yourself is completely totally brought under the blood there will be a total deliverance then you'll have a freedom like you've never known before when everything's brought out of the blood and brought in submission to the kingdom of god then there'll be a real deliverance and look what happened in acts 5 11. look what happened after anonymous sapphire you think it stopped it you think it it caused a a quail in the hearts but there was a great fear or reverence the the entire church was seized with a powerful fear of god which came all over everybody that heard what happened and what happened then the apostles performed many signs and wonders among the people and they were all with one accord look what the results of this was amen it purged the church and when it purged the church amen there was even more miracles and signs and wonders done and the believers were you wonderfully united that's what it means they were in one accord they met regularly at the temple we ought to meet regularly every time the church doors come open amen jesus had a habit it was his custom to go to church he went into synagogue and as was his custom amen you said well i don't want it to be a custom i don't want it to be a ritual it's one ritual you better have that we assembled together even so much some more as we see that day approaching amen but coming with an expectancy i want to see god i want to see jesus it's a time of repressing and i don't want to miss it amen and and there was more and more believed in the lord and more added to the number of great crowds of men and women in fact when the people knew that peter was going to walk by they would carry the six out to the street laid them on cots and mats and there was an incredible power that was emanating from him that would overshadow them and would heal them amen great numbers of people swarmed to jerusalem from the nearby villages and they brought the sick and those were troubled with demons and everyone was healed you talk about a revival when you got sin out of the midst you can have revival when you get sin out of your heart you can have a repression amen would you want to see the power of god move then let everybody begin to call on the name of the lord because those that call on the name of the lord they shall be saved amen i'm going to finish on this quotation y'all hadn't changed that clock and you thought you fooled me but i just got another hour right there brother branham preached he tells about the story of mary and joseph taking jesus to jerusalem to the feast of the passover and there they left jesus thinking he was with them brother branham used this story over and over again and he said we went more than a three-day journey we went 2 000 years without him but we got to go back and return to the place we left him and he pointed out the place that the church left him was pentecost and he said we find it in our churches this is 1965. we find out in our churches we're missing something in our churches and that's the power of christ now he said i don't want to criticize i love you a genuine with a genuine love and love is always corrected we are missing christ in our church we're missing christ amongst our pentecostal people our brothers and sisters there's something wrong the old-fashioned prayer meetings they used to have all day and night they don't have them no more our women used to wear long hair they don't do it anymore it would be a disgrace for women to paint and use paint back in the early days and act the way that women do something went wrong there's nothing wrong with christ but something went wrong somewhere the pulpit used to see we wouldn't have permitted such a thing as that but it does now no longer are words coming out of the mouse we're missing something we're missing power that we ought to have where the big machine ought to be running up at great signs and wonders why this building ought to be so sitting so full of the power of god now to sinner couldn't stay in there the holy spirit the condemnant right quickly like that like ananias sapphiras we're missing something he would say again where are we short god i want to live today to see the day that the church of jesus christ can be one and purpose and heart and body standing in the full anointed power of the holy spirit to perform and work like jesus christ did with god in them too it's a church out of position and sadly we don't just need to look around at pentecostal and baptist and methodists we need to look right at our own ranks and say why if god be with us where are the miracles he uses that illustration of them leaving jesus at jerusalem and i'm closing on this and he says i believe the church has done that just upon the thoughts oh he's with us oh he's with us we don't have to have miracles and signs and so forth we don't have to have divine healing today we don't have to have the gifts of the spirit they're not for this day oh he's with us anyhow and he said oh my precious brothers do you realize we have found out that all our creeds and churches were finding discord and confusion something's wrong and sometimes we think he might be among our kindred i heard that expression many times my mother was a methodist or baptist or presbyterian or so you'll never find him like that and sometimes you depend on what your mother had and experience to atone for you it's got to be your own personal faith in god you just don't find him there so they checked from pastor to pastor from church to church we would say making it modern and they could not find him anywhere and he said i feel sorry for people today many thousands of people in this nation that's belong to dozens of different churches trying to find where jesus is and they just go from one certain church and check there they go to another church and check there and they find out there's something wrong they don't act like believe like worship light there's no sound of the king in the camp there's no joy now remember we were there what will the holy ghost do it brings times of refreshing when the holy spirit is in a church it brings times of refreshing and he said i might say that if there was one thing i find among the pentecostal people that makes me to believe that they are certainly outstanding christians is not because they're speaking with tongues or signs of the divine healing it's the joy that they have well let's just start with that let's just start getting our joy back let's just start getting refreshed in the presence of god let's just begin to where he is my everything he is my all right remember when my focus is on his coming he said it's the he said they have no embarrassment hello they just let their hair down and start rejoicing because they got something they're not ashamed of and that makes me believe there's something outstanding about them they're not ashamed they just soon as shout out there in the street as they would here in the church and if a hundred people are laughing at them that wouldn't stop them a bit they continue on shouting joy and find them on the mission field starved to death almost have seen them where they have no shoes on their feet living off of 30 cents a week preaching the gospel brother just as happy as if he was coming to church in the limousine they're happy for they've found something that means more than creeds or denomination or church affiliation they found what it takes to bring joy and a christian should be happy we were prayed for that that our joys might be full it's something about it that's real now we've lost that joy and if we lost those things and we can't find it among our kindred we can find it among them then that's one one thing to do is go back where we left him out and the church should go back to the beginning where they left him and that's exactly what mary and joseph did they left jesus at the feast that's where mary and joseph left jesus and he said i say this with due consideration and respect that's where both catholic and protestants left jesus at the feast of pentecost you can't find him searching around through creeds and denominations denomination and creeds and all should go back to the beginning when jesus on the earth he said i'm divine you're the branches and if a vine comes forth and a branch comes out of that vine the first branch comes up the second branch looks just like the first one the third one looks just like the first one and on to the end of the vine and every branch looks the same one don't come up with grapevine leaves and the other with pawpaw leaves and another with oak leaves and another with palm leaves it starts a grape belief it ends with a great leaf and if the first church was a product of that vine jesus christ and wrote a book of acts out of it the second branch will have to be the same or it's been grafted into something that has a different life i am the vine you are the branches of the first branch brought forth joy love loyalty gifts of the spirit casting out evil spirits water baptism by my mercy then we today find today that all of that is not in the church then the church is getting the church is not getting its life from the vine we baptist methodist pentecostals and what more amen if our church cannot write a book of acts listen to me message believers if our church cannot write a book of acts behind this church then it's the wrong vine there's something wrong with it if jesus was on earth today i'd walk unto him and say lord jesus i go to church that don't believe in divine healing he would say it wasn't so from the beginning if i went to jesus said lord my church does not believe in speaking with other tongues he would say it's not so from the beginning if i went to the lord jesus said i've been sprinkled my church says it's all right my pastor said i'll sprinkle you in water it's just as good as immersion in water jesus was answered it wasn't so at the beginning if i walked to jesus and shook hands and took the right hand of fellowship from a church and i believe that then i was born again jesus would say it is not so from the beginning we've got to go back to the beginning where did the church lead jesus at pentecost and that's where the churches will have to go to find it is back to pentecost that's what we were preaching today friend we've been more than a three-day journey we've been through seven church ages and it's time for the church to turn all the way back to a book of acts experience to where an anonymized sapphire is among us we're pretending it's over and where there's refreshing from the presence of the lord and joy unspeakable and full of glory that ought to be the ambition of the church that has held the coming of the lord jesus and we saw it and say come lord jesus come and it'd be the drive of our heart our ambition what accord one we've got to have jesus our parish amen happy to believe that this morning stand to your feet with me and worship god as the musicians come amen oh my where did we find that spirit power where do we find those people that are drunk like they were on the day of pentecost so drunk on the spirit of god they started staggered like drunk men oh let me tell you he said my catholic friend the blessed mary virgin mary was in there that's right and if god wouldn't let virgin mary come to heaven until she was filled with the holy ghost dare you try to get there with anything less hallelujah how many would say today god let us enter into that time we're pretending it's over well the hypocrisy is out of my heart where i'm not pretending anymore but i'm for real amen where i have that joy unspeakable and full of glory the times of refreshing that you want that refreshing from the presence of the lord buy your head's with me oh jesus where are we standing where are we standing we're living in a dangerous hour and the only place we're going to find you is where the church left you many years ago they left you at pentecost i went through some scripture this morning just to show the church just what the early church was and how you were moving among them i went through all of that to show again we're standing at the very same place and jesus is coming by our fig tree looking for fruit lord i don't know that there's time to dung it and let it fulfill another season that church ages are over we're at the last one i don't know if it's time how could be another messenger come and dunk it and expect to find fruit again we're in the last day if there's no fruit on the tree it'll be cursed forever we're living in the time lord where scoffers arise saying where is the sign of his coming there's a people that are hungry they're in one accord they're different from this world they got their mindset on one thing i want to get out of here i want to leave this world of sin and unbelief it's crashing around us the american flag that used to be loved and honored and appreciated spit on burned it used to be an emblem of freedom and now they've taken freedom to where they can do and live any kind of thing [Music] it started out with freedom we can have freedom of religion [Music] and the evil ones have turned to word they want freedom from religion and our nation is quickly turning no longer is it speaking like a lamb it's speaking like a dragon [Music] it's speaking too but may there be a people here today that know they're empowered [Music] that know where they're standing that there is a word there is a message there is a truth that will change lives that heal the sick

and you're the one lord you look [Music] you know whether we stumble or we fall or whatever we do lord we want to persevere we want to please you the bible said blessed be the man or that servant that

to you [Music] and now we've kept back and yet we're pretending oh yeah we've done everything the lord required we've done everything lord i pray that there won't be one pretender among us not because he dropped dead but because sin is judged and that sin is dead and they become alive in christ everybody don't have to turn out like an anonymized sapphira there was a liar a thief many a one a denier like peter that took that denier and made a spokesman put words in his mouth lord your power goes forth can still go forth like it did with paul say to a man who is hindering the gospel may you be blind for a season an element would be blind not be able to see the light of day your word has power in it and your church is to be a people of the word i pray lord you'll take the message today strike it down to our hearts where we can see where we're standing we're standing lord just as they did was standing standing like israel did with a new land before them clean new land go possess it
