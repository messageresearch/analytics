[1:00:36] as far as I care right in this service
[1:00:38] this morning amen Genesis chapter 18
[1:00:42] verse 9 and they said unto him where is
[1:00:46] Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the
[1:00:48] tent and he said I will certainly return
[1:00:51] unto thee according to the time of life
[1:00:54] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[1:00:57] God bless you you can be seated
[1:01:00] we're going to be speaking today on the
[1:01:02] promise of restoration renewed
[1:01:06] you know that laodicean age has been a
[1:01:10] an age of restoration actually it
[1:01:13] started in 1906 with the restoration of
[1:01:16] the gifts and and they did they believed
[1:01:19] that that was the promised restoration
[1:01:21] that God had promised in in Joel chapter
[1:01:24] 2 and
[1:01:26] um also many other scriptures and they
[1:01:29] looked it out and they believed for it
[1:01:31] but you know God was not through in his
[1:01:34] restoration
[1:01:36] so he would he would bring it all the
[1:01:39] way down to the administration of the
[1:01:41] son of man and in the and where the
[1:01:43] ministry of Christ was repeated again
[1:01:45] and this our day to bring about the
[1:01:50] restoration that is promised and we are
[1:01:53] still in that great hour of restoration
[1:01:55] even this morning as we speak now Sarah
[1:01:59] as we open our our scene with Sarah she
[1:02:03] had long dismissed the promise that was
[1:02:07] given
[1:02:08] um by God for Abraham and she felt that
[1:02:12] she had solved that issue many years
[1:02:14] before when she uh concluded that she
[1:02:18] was not the one to fulfill that promise
[1:02:21] and she gave Hagar the slave girl to
[1:02:24] Abraham to fulfill but in the
[1:02:26] dispensation of the son of man when the
[1:02:29] angel came to Sarah calling her by name
[1:02:32] she had to face it that it was not for
[1:02:35] someone else else but for her
[1:02:38] and this is what we're wanting to do is
[1:02:40] we're wanting to face it this morning
[1:02:42] that this restoration means me
[1:02:46] amen it is for us it is our day it is
[1:02:49] our hour it is our time you see she had
[1:02:52] believed a lie
[1:02:54] and so is the church until there's been
[1:02:57] a great Fallen away
[1:02:59] and even until this day but God still
[1:03:02] declares no matter what has happened I'm
[1:03:05] going to restore
[1:03:07] God never changes his mind about his
[1:03:10] word he never abandons a project
[1:03:13] amen so in the midst of a fallen way
[1:03:16] there is also a restoration
[1:03:19] you see Sarah's story had to be changed
[1:03:22] all these years she had believed the
[1:03:23] wrong story
[1:03:25] she had but it become faithful faithless
[1:03:28] and um disillusioned and bitter sitting
[1:03:32] in her tents she believed that the child
[1:03:35] of Abraham and the bonds woman was the
[1:03:39] promised child and she just accepted as
[1:03:42] fact that she was unable
[1:03:44] and that she didn't have enough Faith to
[1:03:47] be changed because she was 65 when
[1:03:49] Abraham was was given the promise of a
[1:03:53] son and it took Faith to believe it then
[1:03:55] and she didn't have the strength to
[1:03:57] conceive so she gave the high honors to
[1:04:00] a slave girl and this same scenario has
[1:04:04] repeated over and over and over again
[1:04:08] Through the Ages Luther was given a a
[1:04:11] promise to bring forth Christ but before
[1:04:14] he did the lutherans believed the wrong
[1:04:17] story
[1:04:18] you see they felt it was impossible to
[1:04:21] become a book of Acts Church
[1:04:24] and as the delay went on they gave it
[1:04:27] over to Bond's woman a slave girl and
[1:04:29] instead of a book of Acts Church they
[1:04:32] produced Denise meal a wild man who
[1:04:35] whose hand was against every man a
[1:04:39] denomination under the bondage of men
[1:04:42] and it wasn't long until lutherans was
[1:04:45] just like the Catholics that they came
[1:04:47] out of and you know it led by men
[1:04:50] instead of being led by the Holy Ghost
[1:04:53] you see this has happened throughout the
[1:04:56] Reformation over and over and over again
[1:04:59] the promise given the promise rejected
[1:05:01] you know believe in the wrong story
[1:05:04] so that the only thing that was produced
[1:05:07] was another system of bondage enslaving
[1:05:11] Souls of man and another denominational
[1:05:13] system now the first age fell by
[1:05:18] believing the wrong story
[1:05:20] you see the supernatural was pushed out
[1:05:23] and you know was taken over by
[1:05:27] intellectualism just like Sarah did by
[1:05:30] the bonds woman and her son you know
[1:05:33] here that this child was born and this
[1:05:35] woman now is the
[1:05:37] um the mother of the of the air and
[1:05:41] Sarah is basically resigned to the tent
[1:05:44] and it seemed that
[1:05:46] um Hagar and his sons were now the error
[1:05:49] of the promise and Sarah now is an old
[1:05:53] woman
[1:05:54] and she no longer felt Abraham's embrace
[1:05:57] the love affair that they had as a young
[1:06:01] couple no longer existed
[1:06:04] you see she even said so when she
[1:06:07] laughed and said after I'm waxed old
[1:06:09] shall I have pleasure my Lord being old
[1:06:11] also you know the love of air is over
[1:06:15] with
[1:06:15] now that they were all they no longer
[1:06:18] kissed one another good night they no
[1:06:21] longer slept in the same bed they she
[1:06:24] had her tenth Abraham had his tent there
[1:06:26] was no more pleasure in marriage that's
[1:06:29] like the church that has lost its first
[1:06:32] love there is no more hallelujahs
[1:06:36] no more glories to God there's no more
[1:06:39] feeling of the warmth of his presence
[1:06:41] there's no more hearing his voice in the
[1:06:45] middle of the night and with prophecies
[1:06:47] and foretelling and giving Assurance you
[1:06:50] know the closeness is gone well it used
[1:06:53] to come down as a pillar of fire oh I
[1:06:57] remember the romance why it was a love
[1:06:59] affair that tears would come down the
[1:07:02] cheeks of the Saints and the shadow of
[1:07:04] the King was in the midst I remember the
[1:07:07] closeness when men and women were led by
[1:07:10] the Holy Ghost and and what God would
[1:07:13] show Visions or manifest himself in
[1:07:16] dreams and what sometimes we'd pray all
[1:07:18] night he would come down and he would
[1:07:20] heal our sick or he would cast out
[1:07:23] devils and they you know for demons
[1:07:25] couldn't stay in his presence he was our
[1:07:28] comforter he was our Prince he was the
[1:07:30] joy of our heart but that's now a day
[1:07:33] passed it's just not the season for that
[1:07:36] that God doesn't do that anymore we're
[1:07:39] past that we're past that age and we
[1:07:42] we're now going on and we're more mature
[1:07:45] with some mature that the marriage is
[1:07:47] only paper because the spark is now gone
[1:07:52] the joy is diminished the hope is lost
[1:07:55] and not of not Faith left to heal a
[1:07:58] toothache
[1:07:59] you see you know Sarah smirks and says
[1:08:03] that which is perfect has come you see
[1:08:05] we already have an Ishmael it's it's a
[1:08:08] more excellent way and I'm a resign
[1:08:11] myself to sit in the tent and just wait
[1:08:14] for death
[1:08:18] now that's what some are saying to us
[1:08:20] today
[1:08:22] act like old people
[1:08:28] that all the church should do Sarah at
[1:08:31] your age
[1:08:32] you're an old woman
[1:08:34] quit acting like they did in the book of
[1:08:36] Acts Church
[1:08:39] your material church now you're grown up
[1:08:41] you know better than to act like
[1:08:43] youngsters yeah you did that when you
[1:08:45] were young when you were immature but
[1:08:49] you don't do that now
[1:08:51] because you're an old woman
[1:08:54] and your love of air is over
[1:08:56] and all you got left is bitterness and
[1:08:59] coldness in your teeth
[1:09:02] and you might as well resign yourself to
[1:09:04] thinking and knowing the promise son
[1:09:06] will never come to you it's already come
[1:09:09] it's all over with
[1:09:12] and your love affair is over
[1:09:17] no more getting drunk in the spirit
[1:09:21] that's for the immature you're too old
[1:09:22] for that
[1:09:24] ah your old bones would Creak and pop
[1:09:27] can you imagine that no more gifts I
[1:09:30] mean you can almost smirk in them when
[1:09:32] you think about that old woman dancing
[1:09:36] you know no more gifts from the spirit
[1:09:38] the romance is over
[1:09:40] why those gifts in the spirit are so
[1:09:42] insignificant they're only toys
[1:09:46] they're just trinkets an old woman
[1:09:49] doesn't need to dress up she's just
[1:09:51] gonna stay in her old tent
[1:09:54] she ain't got no purpose there's no plan
[1:09:57] for her she's just this you know
[1:10:00] over right fig that's uh too ripe for
[1:10:03] picking
[1:10:06] see the church brother Madam said is now
[1:10:09] engaged it's like a man engaged his wife
[1:10:13] why does he do what does he do when
[1:10:15] they're engaged he's just bestowing all
[1:10:18] things sending presence making her feel
[1:10:21] good well that's what Christ should do
[1:10:23] in his church he's sending us gifts of
[1:10:26] the Spirit how can you be an Engaged
[1:10:28] then when you are denying these gifts
[1:10:31] exist they're the very love tokens it's
[1:10:35] God's tokens to the church Jesus said so
[1:10:39] these signs shall follow them that
[1:10:42] believe
[1:10:43] remember that is our commission
[1:10:47] and that is the commission we must step
[1:10:49] into and especially those of us who have
[1:10:53] received the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:10:55] which brought back the Gospel of Jesus
[1:10:58] Christ so that this gospel can be
[1:11:01] preached in all the world and
[1:11:03] demonstrated by the preaching of the
[1:11:06] gospel and then shall the end comes
[1:11:13] well that was for the church when the
[1:11:15] church was immaturity remember when we
[1:11:17] was in love Abraham gave gifts he'd
[1:11:20] bring in you know little tokens of love
[1:11:23] and appreciations and you know just
[1:11:25] things to make you feel good
[1:11:28] you know but that's when we were just
[1:11:31] immature
[1:11:33] and brother random says The Church Must
[1:11:35] Believe every word
[1:11:37] every promise ever Iota and claim it for
[1:11:40] themselves and exercise themselves in it
[1:11:43] said if I was engaged a girl and I was a
[1:11:46] single man and I centered something an
[1:11:48] engagement ring and she wouldn't wear it
[1:11:50] then that shows she doesn't believe me
[1:11:53] she doesn't want to be my bride and if
[1:11:56] Christ sends a church the gifts that he
[1:11:58] promised and they refuse them and say
[1:12:00] they're not so they don't want to be the
[1:12:03] bride of Christ their response to some
[1:12:05] other lover and not to Christ the
[1:12:08] bridegroom so the real Church keeps the
[1:12:12] promise and keeps and accepts the gifts
[1:12:15] that God sends them
[1:12:17] that's the real Church
[1:12:20] that's the restored Church
[1:12:23] but you know Sarah is in such she's
[1:12:26] believed the wrong story so long
[1:12:29] until she'll laugh in the face of God
[1:12:32] and just say I've accepted it as fact
[1:12:36] that the days of Miracles are passed
[1:12:38] that only happened in the Branham
[1:12:40] meetings
[1:12:41] you know I I you know
[1:12:43] you know I I've actually I would need
[1:12:46] Divine Healing to be changed to receive
[1:12:49] a son and I'm not going to some Tent
[1:12:51] Revival I I ain't going there ain't
[1:12:53] gonna be no Revival in my tent
[1:12:56] our church is too old I'll be mature for
[1:12:58] that I you know we're just too mature
[1:13:01] you know that love affair was to never
[1:13:05] end
[1:13:07] you see the promise of power which was
[1:13:10] to the apostles that was endowed at
[1:13:13] Pentecost he said it's to you Jews and
[1:13:16] to your children Jews and to them that
[1:13:19] are far off Gentiles and to as many as
[1:13:21] the Lord Our God shall call both Jew and
[1:13:24] Gentile until he stops calling the
[1:13:28] Pentecostal message and power will not
[1:13:31] cease
[1:13:33] amen and if you believe your prophets
[1:13:35] that's his word
[1:13:37] amen but but you see what happened to
[1:13:39] the story of the church
[1:13:42] was turned by nicolaitan spirit
[1:13:49] somewhere she stopped believing
[1:13:52] she stopped believing this was for her
[1:13:56] and that the power that she received at
[1:13:59] Pentecost was for her
[1:14:02] she stopped believing
[1:14:04] the son of Hagar was resistant to the
[1:14:07] promised restoration and when it came he
[1:14:10] mocked and he made fun of it he
[1:14:12] persecuted Isaac and that spirit will
[1:14:15] always make fun and persecute the
[1:14:18] supernatural
[1:14:19] brother random tells us in the church of
[1:14:21] his book no matter how just or uprighted
[1:14:23] Christian is doing before the public and
[1:14:26] how gracious he is to his fellow man do
[1:14:29] not but good but let him confess Christ
[1:14:31] as a savior and acknowledge the
[1:14:34] operation of the gifts of the holy
[1:14:36] spirit in tongues prophecies healing
[1:14:39] Miracles he will be condemned the spirit
[1:14:43] of the world hates the spirit of God
[1:14:45] because it can overcome the spirit of
[1:14:48] the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel
[1:14:52] in whom the spirit of Truth dwells
[1:14:55] now this is Brother Brandon's prayer as
[1:14:59] he approached the church ages
[1:15:02] and as he moves into his commission you
[1:15:06] know because it's not until the church
[1:15:07] ages that he ever refers to Malachi for
[1:15:11] the Elijah prophet and turns to that
[1:15:13] scripture and shows us that Elijah was
[1:15:15] to come to bring a restoration and so
[1:15:18] the first thing he does says he preaches
[1:15:20] the church Jesus I want you to know that
[1:15:23] was Supernatural
[1:15:25] it had to be Supernatural there was it
[1:15:27] was written in the Bible it's Seven
[1:15:29] Stars you know seven seven stars seven
[1:15:32] golden candlesticks so uh seven churches
[1:15:36] or seven churches and and it took a
[1:15:39] revelation from God that would come to
[1:15:42] the prophet to identify those Messengers
[1:15:46] and the ages
[1:15:48] so you know under the Prophet Elijah
[1:15:51] there you know by Vision we were able to
[1:15:56] understand where we have come from
[1:15:59] starting out in the first days and then
[1:16:02] how it declined and it went down and it
[1:16:04] come back up and comes all the way to
[1:16:06] the end where that the alpha is the
[1:16:08] Omega and the grain that was planted at
[1:16:11] the beginning is the grain that's at the
[1:16:13] end
[1:16:15] now brother Branham as he prayed as he
[1:16:18] approached those churches he said May
[1:16:20] during this meeting cause men and women
[1:16:23] to take a new hold newly
[1:16:26] may you raise up speakers with tongues
[1:16:29] interpreters of tongues may you raise up
[1:16:31] gifts of Prophecy raise up preachers and
[1:16:34] pastors evangelists and so forth that
[1:16:36] the church might be edified raise up
[1:16:39] missionaries to go in the field Yonder
[1:16:41] and bring forth this glorious gospel
[1:16:43] where the word shall go may it fall into
[1:16:46] good ground bringing forth a hundredfold
[1:16:48] for we believe we're at the end of the
[1:16:51] age and the consummation is near
[1:16:56] now that's what his desire was for the
[1:16:58] church what he asked God for
[1:17:01] for this last age
[1:17:06] today
[1:17:08] we have too many lecturers in the pulpit
[1:17:11] and God is not in it
[1:17:13] lectures are men who can stand up and
[1:17:16] explain the word in such a way it's just
[1:17:19] breathtaking
[1:17:20] but it's just a lecture it's just an
[1:17:22] educational talk
[1:17:24] it is the mechanics without Dynamics
[1:17:28] you see it's just what they call today a
[1:17:31] TED Talk that means technology
[1:17:33] entertainment and Design By the way a
[1:17:35] TED talk you know it's just um it's just
[1:17:38] kind of a nice little talk Of of uh
[1:17:40] inventions and things that are going on
[1:17:43] and it's informative and whatever but
[1:17:45] it's a lecture
[1:17:47] and the gospel was never intended to be
[1:17:51] in the hands of lecturers but men that
[1:17:54] are called by God and anointed by God
[1:17:58] amen this is what we want to see when we
[1:18:01] when we hear a Minister preach we want
[1:18:03] to see there is anointing with that and
[1:18:06] that signs follow that Ministry
[1:18:09] now brother Brandon brother Branham told
[1:18:11] us you know what Satan would do he said
[1:18:14] Satan you know get in it to try to make
[1:18:16] it all mechanics that's word and no
[1:18:18] Dynamics
[1:18:20] back all Dynamics and no mechanics
[1:18:23] but we got to put it together
[1:18:25] we've got the we've got the power of the
[1:18:28] Holy Spirit but we've got to combat with
[1:18:30] the word to feed this machine we can't
[1:18:33] feed it on Creed it won't burn it it
[1:18:35] chokes up the blues it will not burn it
[1:18:37] it was made for the word of God man
[1:18:39] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:18:42] every word that proceedeth out the mouth
[1:18:44] of God
[1:18:46] so you see again Satan gets in it to
[1:18:49] make it one way or the other
[1:18:52] you know just all mechanics and no
[1:18:55] Dynamics are all Dynamics
[1:18:58] which is cranking on the engine
[1:19:02] well we got sparked somebody's shouting
[1:19:05] and dancing around the room but they
[1:19:07] can't run down the road to Deliverance
[1:19:13] oh we've got all mechanics we got the
[1:19:16] car all polished and looking nice filled
[1:19:18] with guys and it's got octane power in
[1:19:20] it but no spark
[1:19:22] it's got to have both
[1:19:25] to produce Deliverance
[1:19:29] amen well you know a lot of people you
[1:19:32] know want to criticize and say well I
[1:19:34] tell you I saw some of them jump and
[1:19:36] shout and whatever and go out and live
[1:19:38] like Devils well I've seen some of them
[1:19:40] get so intellectual too and have all
[1:19:43] kinds of knowledge of the word and go
[1:19:45] out and live like devils
[1:19:50] pot can call kettle black it takes a
[1:19:53] worship in spirit and in truth
[1:19:56] hey man we we don't want Dynamics just
[1:19:59] cranking on the machine without the
[1:20:01] mechanics without the word
[1:20:03] amen you got to have both of them but we
[1:20:06] don't want just all work work and you
[1:20:09] can't even crank the engine there's no
[1:20:11] spark it don't go nowhere and it neither
[1:20:14] one of those deliver
[1:20:20] y now
[1:20:21] but brother Branham said there ought to
[1:20:23] be a holy power surrounding and in the
[1:20:27] church
[1:20:28] that will make demons flee and instead
[1:20:31] of that it's become a laughing stocks
[1:20:33] what is it mechanics instead of the
[1:20:37] Dynamics
[1:20:41] now I want to just turn over to
[1:20:44] Revelation 2 14 for a moment and then
[1:20:46] we'll look at an earlier scripture in
[1:20:49] Revelation 2 also
[1:20:51] in the Ephesians age but let's just kind
[1:20:53] of review a few things here
[1:20:57] thou Hast them that hold the doctrine of
[1:20:59] Balaam
[1:21:01] notice this he said I have a few things
[1:21:05] against you because their house has
[1:21:08] their them that hold the doctrine of
[1:21:10] Balaam who taught balak to cast a
[1:21:13] stumbling block before the children of
[1:21:15] Israel to eat up things sacrificing the
[1:21:18] idols and to commit fornication
[1:21:21] so now again we already spoke about
[1:21:25] nicolaitanism we'll go in to find that a
[1:21:27] little more here in a moment
[1:21:29] but now you just can't have a and I'm
[1:21:31] quoting from the churches book you just
[1:21:33] can't have a nicolaitan set up in the
[1:21:36] church
[1:21:37] and not have this other Doctrine the
[1:21:39] doctrine of Balaam come into
[1:21:41] you see if you take away the word of God
[1:21:43] and the moving of the spirit as a move
[1:21:47] means of worship they that worship me
[1:21:50] must worship me in spirit and in truth
[1:21:52] then you will have to give the people
[1:21:54] another form of worship as a substitute
[1:21:59] and substitution spells balamism
[1:22:04] so what's now you if you take away the
[1:22:07] word of God and the moving of the spirit
[1:22:10] see they've got to be both of them
[1:22:12] together
[1:22:14] now listen church this is what separates
[1:22:18] us from Azusa Pentecost
[1:22:21] because they have Spirit without Word
[1:22:27] amen now of course you know to have word
[1:22:30] without Spirit you're just as bad as
[1:22:32] them
[1:22:34] it's up to you you're probably a couple
[1:22:36] of churches behind them over in the
[1:22:37] Baptist or methodists
[1:22:39] so now you see but if you if you take
[1:22:43] away this word and the spirit the
[1:22:45] movement of the spirit as meaning of
[1:22:47] worship then you have to give the people
[1:22:50] another form of worship
[1:22:52] as a substitute
[1:22:55] and this is balamism
[1:22:57] It Works hand in hand with nicolaitanism
[1:23:02] now in the again as he said so Israel
[1:23:06] came up to the borders of Moab sent
[1:23:08] Messengers to the king saying we're
[1:23:11] brothers let us pass to your land if our
[1:23:13] people are animals eat or drink anything
[1:23:15] we'll gladly pay for it but King balak
[1:23:18] got very excited that head of that
[1:23:20] nicolaitan Bunch was not about to let
[1:23:23] the church come through with its signs
[1:23:26] and wonders and divers manifestations of
[1:23:29] the Holy Ghost with their faces shining
[1:23:31] with the glory of God it was too risky
[1:23:34] as he might lose some of his crowd
[1:23:38] so balak refused to let Israel pass
[1:23:41] through in fact so great was his fear of
[1:23:44] them that he went to Highland Prophet
[1:23:47] called Balaam and asked him to mediate
[1:23:49] between him and God and petition the
[1:23:52] almighty to curse Israel and render them
[1:23:55] impotent and Balaam being eager to take
[1:24:00] part in political Affairs become a great
[1:24:02] man was only too glad to do that but
[1:24:05] seeing he had to approach to and receive
[1:24:07] an audience from God to get the people
[1:24:09] cursed as he could not do that by
[1:24:11] himself he went to ask God if he could
[1:24:14] have permission to go now isn't that
[1:24:17] just like the Nicolaitans we have with
[1:24:19] us today they curse everyone that won't
[1:24:24] go their way
[1:24:27] so Balaam went down and he set up seven
[1:24:29] halters for the seven clean Beast of
[1:24:32] sacrifice he killed a ram signifying the
[1:24:34] coming of the Messiah he knew what to do
[1:24:37] to approach him to God he had the
[1:24:39] mechanics just right but not the
[1:24:41] Dynamics is now can't you see it
[1:24:43] Nicolaitans there was Israel down there
[1:24:46] in the valley offering the same
[1:24:48] sacrifice doing the same things but only
[1:24:50] one had signs following only one had got
[1:24:54] in the midst forms won't get you
[1:24:57] anywhere it can't take place it can't
[1:25:00] take the place of spirit manifestations
[1:25:03] that's what happened at nicaea they put
[1:25:07] balaam's Doctrine not the doctrine of
[1:25:09] God they put balaams over in balaam's
[1:25:12] Doctrine not the doctrine of God they
[1:25:14] stumbled yay they fell they became dead
[1:25:17] men
[1:25:19] now
[1:25:20] understand the Dynamics is the Holy
[1:25:25] Ghost
[1:25:26] when it came originally
[1:25:29] it did not come word only
[1:25:33] neither did it come Spirit only
[1:25:36] but it was the word being manifested
[1:25:41] displayed
[1:25:43] amen
[1:25:44] now Peter would immediately say this is
[1:25:47] that which the prophet Joel spoke of so
[1:25:51] he said it's the scripture being made
[1:25:54] alive
[1:25:56] it's the spirit quickened or the spirit
[1:25:59] quickening the word and this is what
[1:26:02] you're seeing this word becoming flesh
[1:26:05] now so again first Thessalonians 1 5 for
[1:26:09] Our Gospel came not unto you in word
[1:26:12] only
[1:26:14] but also in power and in the Holy Ghost
[1:26:18] and in much Assurance so now here's how
[1:26:21] the gospel is it comes not just word
[1:26:25] but it's also coming with power
[1:26:29] and in the Holy Ghost
[1:26:31] so it comes with a display of the power
[1:26:35] of God
[1:26:36] that's how we know it's the word
[1:26:39] because otherwise it's just a Creed or a
[1:26:41] Dogma
[1:26:42] even though it's quoting scripture
[1:26:44] remember Satan quoted scripture
[1:26:48] he quoted quotes
[1:26:52] amen and he lined up his quotes to get
[1:26:55] Jesus to disobey God and the spirit of
[1:26:59] God wasn't in it
[1:27:01] come on Church
[1:27:03] amen now and it is the rising of the sun
[1:27:07] he said you can do nothing without me
[1:27:09] but with me you can do all things as he
[1:27:12] is the word is the father living the
[1:27:15] father sent me so send I you as the
[1:27:17] father fired me and pushed me into
[1:27:19] everything I do that only that which is
[1:27:22] pleasing to God so as he sent me a so
[1:27:25] send by you with the same mechanics and
[1:27:28] it takes the same Dynamics operated and
[1:27:31] these signs shall follow them that claim
[1:27:34] to have the mechanics the Dynamics will
[1:27:37] take his place
[1:27:39] so if we claim to have the mechanics the
[1:27:42] word
[1:27:43] the Dynamics got to take its place with
[1:27:46] the word
[1:27:49] Paul said the gospel came not but to us
[1:27:52] in word only through gasoline only but
[1:27:54] through spark also to make it move there
[1:27:57] you are it came to us in that manner and
[1:28:00] as I said it'll make the car move down
[1:28:02] to Divine Healing to an overcoming life
[1:28:05] amen to Salvation to receiving the Holy
[1:28:08] Ghost to any promise of God it'll make
[1:28:10] that car move down to it
[1:28:12] amen now but I want to get this to you
[1:28:16] church so that you are fully assured as
[1:28:19] God would impart to us some of the last
[1:28:21] things by this by the seventh angel
[1:28:24] messenger he would speak as John 14
[1:28:28] where Jesus leaving his disciples said I
[1:28:31] go to prepare a place for you
[1:28:33] and brother Brandon would preach a
[1:28:35] sermon things that are to be
[1:28:39] this is what you can expect
[1:28:42] you know I I'm leaving here but you can
[1:28:46] expect here you can expect this to
[1:28:48] happen things that are to be and I
[1:28:50] believe he said that's the same thing we
[1:28:52] live in today God bearing record of his
[1:28:55] word vindicating what he said he would
[1:28:58] do now we know this is the day of
[1:29:01] salvation
[1:29:03] where God is calling men from the world
[1:29:07] from a life of sin to a life of service
[1:29:11] and in the day that God has poured out
[1:29:14] his Spirit from on high great signs and
[1:29:17] wonders or to accompany the ministry of
[1:29:20] this day
[1:29:22] amen this is when the former latter rain
[1:29:25] are falling together and we know they're
[1:29:27] supposed to be great signs and wonders
[1:29:29] which in many the great denominations
[1:29:32] this is turned down but I'm thankful for
[1:29:35] these open doors like I've had to get
[1:29:38] into and the inspiration is given to
[1:29:41] young men like your pastor here that
[1:29:43] calls him is I'm beginning to get old
[1:29:44] and no my days are numbered and know
[1:29:47] that these young men can take this
[1:29:49] message and sweep it on to the coming of
[1:29:51] the Lord if he doesn't come in my
[1:29:53] generation which I'm hoping to see him I
[1:29:55] look daily for my what's keeping myself
[1:29:57] prepared for that hour
[1:30:00] now so again this is what he expected
[1:30:04] not only for his day but to follow in
[1:30:08] young men
[1:30:10] who would sweep it on to the coming of
[1:30:12] the Lord
[1:30:14] amen now of course you know it would be
[1:30:17] a time where great signs and wonders
[1:30:20] where that he would say former and
[1:30:23] latter rain Fallen together great signs
[1:30:26] and wonders to accompany the ministry of
[1:30:28] this day this must be
[1:30:31] what is happening in The Bride of Jesus
[1:30:35] Christ
[1:30:37] she is to be a renewed woman
[1:30:40] with renewed faith a people who the
[1:30:44] promise of restoration has been accepted
[1:30:47] and is renewed in them and it's causing
[1:30:50] a renewal in their life
[1:30:52] are you with me now
[1:30:53] all right now so there again you know
[1:30:56] first love
[1:30:58] you know a child comes from Love
[1:31:02] you mean me and Abraham are going to
[1:31:04] have a love affair again
[1:31:06] well let's just talk about it for a
[1:31:08] minute
[1:31:08] let's see how the church
[1:31:12] became like Sarah in the tent
[1:31:15] old
[1:31:16] disillusioned
[1:31:18] haven't forgot the promise believe the
[1:31:21] wrong story
[1:31:23] because church this is our condition
[1:31:27] this is where the church has been
[1:31:28] through many many years they believed
[1:31:31] the wrong story
[1:31:33] they believed a lie
[1:31:36] I mean come on you I can take you easily
[1:31:39] and just show you Trinity
[1:31:41] the trinitarian doctrine what did they
[1:31:43] do they believed the wrong story
[1:31:46] somebody distorted the story
[1:31:50] and they believed a lie
[1:31:52] and that lie today will damn you
[1:31:56] if you don't turn from it
[1:31:59] come on we have to come back and believe
[1:32:02] in one God again
[1:32:04] because we got a one-god Bible
[1:32:08] amen we're one God people
[1:32:12] now first of all as we look at this
[1:32:15] we're going to see how Sarah kind of
[1:32:19] fell out of love you know and you turn
[1:32:21] with me to Revelation 2 and 1 and we'll
[1:32:24] read from there
[1:32:26] and as we're going in here I want you to
[1:32:28] just think
[1:32:29] it's the Ephesus to the Church of
[1:32:32] Ephesus
[1:32:35] now Ephesus means
[1:32:38] to let go relax
[1:32:42] backslidden
[1:32:44] they were called by God the backslidden
[1:32:46] church
[1:32:48] and God acknowledged first their Works
[1:32:50] their labor their patience he rebuked
[1:32:52] their their their living for or leaving
[1:32:55] their first love for backsliding for no
[1:32:58] longer bearing light
[1:33:00] Ephesus was not a deceived Church it
[1:33:03] failed Itself by not continuing in
[1:33:06] perfect love
[1:33:09] now so as we look here in Revelation 2
[1:33:13] and 1. I want to just as we have preface
[1:33:16] it we're going to talk about the angel
[1:33:18] to the Church of Ephesus right these
[1:33:21] things saith he that holdeth the Seven
[1:33:23] Stars in his right hand who walketh in
[1:33:26] the midst of the seven golden
[1:33:28] Candlestick and of course that was
[1:33:30] Christ and he walks through every age
[1:33:33] and he's walking in this age today
[1:33:36] don't let nobody mess your mind up we're
[1:33:40] here in the laoter cnh where Christ is
[1:33:43] still walking among his people
[1:33:45] now he said I know that works and I
[1:33:47] labor and thy patience and I know thou
[1:33:50] cannot bear them with your evil and they
[1:33:53] have tried them that say their Apostles
[1:33:55] and are not and you found them liars and
[1:33:57] you're born and had patience and from my
[1:33:59] namesake and uh you have labored and has
[1:34:03] not fainted nevertheless
[1:34:05] I have somewhat against thee
[1:34:09] because thou has left that first love
[1:34:13] remember therefore from Once Thou Art
[1:34:15] fallen so she's already a fallen woman
[1:34:19] and repent and do the verse works
[1:34:22] or else I will come unto thee quickly
[1:34:24] and I'll remove that Candlestick out of
[1:34:27] his place except thou repent but this
[1:34:30] thou has the hate us the Deeds of the
[1:34:33] Nicolaitans which I also hate
[1:34:37] so you know he says now
[1:34:40] you believe he said this is what I got
[1:34:42] against you you've left your first love
[1:34:47] here's Sarah was
[1:34:49] and she says
[1:34:51] there's no love affair anymore
[1:34:53] and it ain't possible
[1:34:56] that's the condition of the end time
[1:34:59] Church
[1:35:03] that was what was happening here as the
[1:35:05] Fallen away began
[1:35:07] they lost their first love notice but
[1:35:11] there was also among them Deeds of the
[1:35:15] Nicolaitans
[1:35:17] now I'm going to take some Snippets from
[1:35:20] the Ephesian Church age not to church
[1:35:22] each book but as brother Brandon
[1:35:24] preached it and I'm just going to share
[1:35:27] with you just some one-liners here that
[1:35:29] I've I have picked out of this first
[1:35:31] love he said but there's something I got
[1:35:34] against you that that is you have left
[1:35:36] your verse loved you left the love you
[1:35:39] have had for them good old-fashioned
[1:35:42] Holy Ghost meetings
[1:35:44] and you begin to kind of slide backwards
[1:35:47] into that formal come in with a Our
[1:35:50] Father
[1:35:54] and then he said what did you do you
[1:35:57] lost your first lost your first love oh
[1:35:59] you couldn't get on them Corners with a
[1:36:01] tambourine to clap their hands and
[1:36:03] praise God oh no
[1:36:06] oh to formal they can't say Amen no more
[1:36:09] my goodness he'd break up some of their
[1:36:11] makeup
[1:36:13] if God had doubt against this church
[1:36:15] he's got against he's got against
[1:36:18] Thatcher that one too
[1:36:21] because you have left your first love I
[1:36:23] got it against you I have something to
[1:36:25] get you that's my complaint you once had
[1:36:28] a great time but you let the world creep
[1:36:31] in and you got to act in a little formal
[1:36:36] oh mercy what we need is back to our
[1:36:39] first love back to Pentecost
[1:36:43] not Azusa Street now
[1:36:45] Pentecost
[1:36:47] you see you see it started out like a
[1:36:51] figure when the seal was open it showed
[1:36:54] the Antichrist Spirit coming in as a
[1:36:57] spirit
[1:36:58] that looked like Christ
[1:37:01] riding on a white horse
[1:37:04] which should represent Purity and
[1:37:08] Holiness but it was an Insidious spirit
[1:37:12] that began to come in
[1:37:14] and begin to and to begin to conquer
[1:37:18] to conquer the laity
[1:37:23] now
[1:37:24] again in the second seal brother Branham
[1:37:27] tells about this he said this horse
[1:37:30] rider went forth as as we
[1:37:33] background in it till he hit the seal
[1:37:35] the notices white horse rider when he
[1:37:38] went out he serves in three stages the
[1:37:41] devil as I proved to you the other night
[1:37:43] is in a trinity like God but it's the
[1:37:45] same devil all the time in three stages
[1:37:47] notice in his stages in the first stage
[1:37:50] he come in the Holy Ghost fell and
[1:37:53] people had everything in common and the
[1:37:56] spirit of God was upon them and the
[1:37:57] apostles went from house to house
[1:37:59] breaking bread with the people and there
[1:38:02] was great signs and wonders Roth and the
[1:38:05] first thing you know
[1:38:06] the Satan began to cause a murmur to
[1:38:10] come up and then after a while those
[1:38:13] slaves and the poor of the land were to
[1:38:15] received the Holy Ghost they went out
[1:38:17] into different places testifying and
[1:38:19] testified to their masters and after a
[1:38:22] while they began to come in all like
[1:38:24] Army captains and different people as
[1:38:26] celebrity see the gallantry and the
[1:38:29] Miracles and the signs that these men
[1:38:31] had done so they accepted Christianity
[1:38:34] well you see when when these Army
[1:38:38] captains and bosses and so on accepted
[1:38:40] embraced Christianity
[1:38:42] you know and go down there to a place
[1:38:45] where they're meeting in a little old
[1:38:48] dark dingy Hall clap their hands and
[1:38:51] Shout speaking in tongues and getting
[1:38:54] messages why he could never take to that
[1:38:56] that to his competitor or or he said
[1:39:00] whatever it is his associate in business
[1:39:01] he would he he'd never believe it like
[1:39:04] that certainly not so he's got to dress
[1:39:07] it up
[1:39:09] so notice what the Antichrist Spirit
[1:39:11] wants to do to the church he wants to
[1:39:14] refine it
[1:39:19] you know it wants to make it where
[1:39:22] there's nothing happening in the laity
[1:39:28] there's no shout of the king in their
[1:39:30] midst
[1:39:32] he wants to make it where that there is
[1:39:35] no manifestation of the Holy Ghost there
[1:39:37] the only manifestation of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:40] can be in the pulpit
[1:39:45] so he's got to dress it up
[1:39:48] so in this he goes on the second seal so
[1:39:51] they get together and begin to think
[1:39:52] well we'll form something a little
[1:39:54] different Jesus said immediately at the
[1:39:56] first church age I have he got said
[1:39:58] something he told him in the second
[1:40:00] chapter of Revelation here I've got
[1:40:02] somewhat against you because the Deeds
[1:40:04] of the Nicholas and Nico conquer the
[1:40:07] laity in other words instead of
[1:40:09] everybody be one they want to make some
[1:40:11] holy fellow they want to make it some
[1:40:13] kind of they want to pattern in paganism
[1:40:16] from where they come out of and they've
[1:40:18] finally done it in first nicolaitan
[1:40:20] Nicolaitans called into Bible Antichrist
[1:40:22] because it was against the original
[1:40:25] doctrine of Christ and the apostles
[1:40:29] now brother Branham immediately goes in
[1:40:32] to give us a modern example of a
[1:40:36] nicolaitan
[1:40:37] so the next paragraph he tells us I
[1:40:40] don't call the man's name he's a great
[1:40:43] man but I was at his meetings a few
[1:40:45] years ago so this is the first hand
[1:40:47] account
[1:40:48] he said I shook his hand and he said you
[1:40:51] know we have such today to call they
[1:40:54] call Pentecostals he said they rely upon
[1:40:56] the book of Acts and he said you see
[1:40:58] acts was only scaffold work for the
[1:41:02] church
[1:41:04] now would you imagine a man that just
[1:41:06] studied the Bible a gallon old man
[1:41:08] studied the Bible the way this fellow
[1:41:10] has and would remake A remark like that
[1:41:12] it doesn't even sound like the holy
[1:41:15] spirit is around it's got to it's got
[1:41:17] not to be nowhere
[1:41:20] so this was a lecturer because anybody
[1:41:23] would come and understanding would know
[1:41:25] that the acts of the apostle was not the
[1:41:29] Acts of the Apostles it was the acts of
[1:41:32] the holy spirit in the apostles
[1:41:37] amen now
[1:41:39] brother random tells his story on
[1:41:41] several occasions said one plan one
[1:41:44] place he said I went and I spoke to the
[1:41:46] man and said that was a great sermon
[1:41:49] but he said I just want to remind you
[1:41:51] the scaffold is needed to the last piece
[1:41:55] is put on the on the building
[1:41:57] and he said as long as God is calling
[1:42:01] we still need the book of Acts we still
[1:42:04] need the scaffold work to put that at
[1:42:07] the Top If it's at the very top spire
[1:42:10] so to put the Capstone on the church
[1:42:13] which is the physical literal return of
[1:42:17] Jesus Christ we will need the scaffold
[1:42:20] work we will need the apostolic way
[1:42:26] right down to the end to the finish of
[1:42:29] stone
[1:42:36] now today
[1:42:38] we have some we have the same
[1:42:41] Alexander Campbell Church of Christ
[1:42:43] Doctrine that's being preached in
[1:42:46] message pulpits
[1:42:48] excuse me
[1:42:51] outside a little bit
[1:42:53] that ain't right but we'll get another
[1:42:54] microphone but we're going to work with
[1:42:56] this
[1:42:57] today we have the same
[1:42:59] type
[1:43:01] everybody's heard of the Church of
[1:43:02] Christ today they're not Church of
[1:43:04] Christ they're Church of the Antichrist
[1:43:07] and the reason I say that because
[1:43:08] they're anti-anointing
[1:43:10] Christ means the anointing and if there
[1:43:14] ever was a group of people against
[1:43:16] Miracles healing Deliverance signs
[1:43:20] wonders everything is the what is called
[1:43:24] The Church of Christ
[1:43:27] it's uh that the Christian Church the
[1:43:29] Church of Christ anyway it's a move
[1:43:31] started by Alexander Campbell brother
[1:43:34] random called them Campbell lights
[1:43:36] these are the said the same sermon that
[1:43:39] Dr best preached brother Brandon said he
[1:43:42] preached a good old Camelot sermon that
[1:43:45] in the Millennium will have healing but
[1:43:46] we don't have it now
[1:43:48] that it ain't for today so you know they
[1:43:51] withstood him all the way to the end
[1:43:54] brother Branham with every breath he had
[1:43:56] fought against
[1:43:58] this spirit
[1:44:00] and I was saying it's now being preached
[1:44:03] in message pulpits
[1:44:04] [Music]
[1:44:07] amen against the anointing
[1:44:09] against the move of the Holy Spirit
[1:44:12] against the works of God you see and and
[1:44:16] it and it's taught here's the teaching
[1:44:18] that since the word was restored and we
[1:44:22] now have that which is perfect the
[1:44:24] perfect word that and it's calmed and
[1:44:26] that which is in part is done away with
[1:44:28] this is nothing more than the Campbell
[1:44:32] light Doctrine
[1:44:40] so they say
[1:44:41] they've worked their way around well
[1:44:43] we're not going to have
[1:44:45] the a book of Acts Church we're going to
[1:44:47] have another book of Acts and it's not
[1:44:48] going to be like that one
[1:44:54] verse 6 that we read but this thou Hast
[1:44:58] you hate
[1:45:00] the Deeds of the Nicolaitans
[1:45:03] I'm going to tell you you're going to
[1:45:04] have to be like them hate
[1:45:07] the Deeds of the Nicolaitans
[1:45:12] we don't hate people
[1:45:14] but we hate the Deeds
[1:45:16] the thing that thing that that is to
[1:45:19] conquer the laity Nicole brother banham
[1:45:22] said which means to conquer overthrow
[1:45:24] Nicolaitans overthrower conquer the
[1:45:26] laity what they were trying to do here
[1:45:28] was trying to take to church where God
[1:45:31] had Pastors in the spirit of God moving
[1:45:34] by gifts in the in the Church of the
[1:45:36] Living God that God said he hated he
[1:45:41] hates it yet today
[1:45:42] Nicolaitans nickel overcome overthrow
[1:45:45] the laity the laity is a church I mean
[1:45:48] he knows the lady is a church all right
[1:45:50] overthrow or a conqueror and take the
[1:45:54] place of the laity in other words take
[1:45:57] all the sacredness all the power from
[1:46:01] the church
[1:46:02] and put it on the priest
[1:46:05] or the preachers
[1:46:07] let the congregation live the way it
[1:46:09] wants to but the priest is the Holy One
[1:46:12] you're not about the way it is you know
[1:46:15] yeah we expect the preacher to live holy
[1:46:17] and do right but you know you
[1:46:20] you gotta you gotta have your your
[1:46:22] problem with porn you know you can't
[1:46:24] help it it's just your Humanity
[1:46:26] but you know somehow we got a an elite
[1:46:29] class that oh they can live right
[1:46:30] they're the ones adopted by the way
[1:46:32] they're the ones that's mature and and
[1:46:34] whatever but you you you underlings you
[1:46:37] just can't do it yet
[1:46:40] power hadn't come for you to live right
[1:46:44] now so he said he said here put it on
[1:46:48] them taken the Holy Ghost away from the
[1:46:51] people with signs and wonders following
[1:46:54] them and take it away and give them a
[1:46:57] holy priesthood taking away the Holy
[1:46:59] Ghost and swapping it for a priesthood
[1:47:02] that it is today only preachers only the
[1:47:07] priests can live an overcoming life
[1:47:09] because the Holy Ghost is taken away
[1:47:13] from the people
[1:47:16] you see you know
[1:47:18] you can't help but stumble and fall and
[1:47:21] make a big mess of yourself because you
[1:47:22] ain't adopted yet
[1:47:24] and when you get adopted well you'll be
[1:47:26] sealed and you won't do that no more but
[1:47:28] until that comes you're just in a mess
[1:47:30] and we don't know when that's going to
[1:47:31] be or how it happens
[1:47:35] but it'll come someday
[1:47:37] what about you preaching oh we've we're
[1:47:39] already adopted
[1:47:46] but brother Brandon said where is the
[1:47:48] first love you once had um
[1:47:51] where is that Joy you used to have as
[1:47:54] David once cried oh Lord restore to me
[1:47:56] the joy of my salvation wear them all
[1:47:59] night prayer meetings the tears on your
[1:48:00] cheek
[1:48:01] out the church the resurrected Lord
[1:48:04] Jesus with signs and wonders among the
[1:48:06] Believers and overseer trying to take
[1:48:09] the Holy Ghost away from the laity I'm
[1:48:11] I'm talking I'm using these Snippets of
[1:48:14] what he's told he's explaining how that
[1:48:17] preachers do by like Balaam substituting
[1:48:24] substituting something instead of the
[1:48:28] power of God by the word
[1:48:31] are you with me now so you see Satan
[1:48:34] knows Satan knows that if he can just
[1:48:38] get you to substitute and acts to
[1:48:41] experience
[1:48:44] with just accepting the message
[1:48:49] he knows he's got you defeated that
[1:48:52] you'll never rise above your sins
[1:48:55] you'll never be an overcomer they'll
[1:48:58] never be healing in the church and
[1:49:01] miracles and signs and wonders and gifts
[1:49:03] of the Spirit
[1:49:04] because all you have is an intellectual
[1:49:07] knowledge
[1:49:09] mechanics without Dynamics
[1:49:14] Satan knows surely the original church
[1:49:16] at Pentecost with the power of God Mark
[1:49:19] 16 in action
[1:49:21] is the true church that Jesus claims as
[1:49:23] his own all else's faults
[1:49:28] so
[1:49:30] you know Sarah's over in the tent
[1:49:33] looked like the story is false
[1:49:36] story of her ever having a child that's
[1:49:39] history
[1:49:40] it ain't gonna happen I had it here this
[1:49:42] Ishmael this Ishmael move was all all
[1:49:45] the life all the power
[1:49:48] you see like in the Catholic Church
[1:49:51] you see they they took it and made it
[1:49:54] where place it upon a priesthood where
[1:49:57] the priests held the Holy Ghost in his
[1:49:59] hand a wafer
[1:50:01] and you take the holy wafer stick out
[1:50:04] your tongue put it on you he puts it on
[1:50:07] you see the Holy Ghost comes from the
[1:50:09] preacher
[1:50:11] and it's applied from the preacher to
[1:50:14] your tongue and there you receive the
[1:50:16] Holy Ghost
[1:50:18] Protestant the same way come down the
[1:50:21] altar join the church
[1:50:24] put your name on a book and shake hands
[1:50:27] with the preacher again it's a preacher
[1:50:29] administering
[1:50:32] the Holy Ghost instead of having a
[1:50:36] personal experience with God yourself
[1:50:41] now the message
[1:50:44] said in your seat
[1:50:46] don't dare come to an altar and snot and
[1:50:48] cry
[1:50:49] and have Godly sorrow for your sins just
[1:50:52] make your confession of faith in the
[1:50:54] message
[1:50:55] and the prophet and you got the Holy
[1:50:58] Ghost
[1:51:01] now in many I I wanted to say this in
[1:51:04] many message churches today this is sad
[1:51:08] but there's no further step ever taken
[1:51:11] than water baptism
[1:51:15] no subsequent baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:20] no experience
[1:51:22] and marriage and divorce brother Madam
[1:51:24] says this he is a place where God has
[1:51:27] put his name the only place to worship
[1:51:29] you're not a Christian because you're a
[1:51:31] Protestant you're not a Christian
[1:51:32] because you're Catholic you're not a
[1:51:34] Christian because your Methodist Baptist
[1:51:36] or Pentecostal and let me inject this
[1:51:39] part you are not a Christian because
[1:51:41] you're a message believer
[1:51:44] you are Christian because you have been
[1:51:47] baptized into Jesus Christ by the Holy
[1:51:51] Spirit
[1:51:53] listen to him now not by water
[1:51:56] there is one more one Faith one Lord one
[1:52:00] baptism and that is Holy Spirit baptism
[1:52:04] water baptism inducts you into
[1:52:06] Fellowship the Holy Spirit baptism
[1:52:10] inducts you into Christ there is the
[1:52:13] truth
[1:52:16] so water baptism inducts you into
[1:52:19] Fellowship The Fellowship of the church
[1:52:22] amen but but he said adult but then the
[1:52:26] holy spirit in baptism it ducts you into
[1:52:29] Christ
[1:52:31] so you see there must be something that
[1:52:35] follows baptism water baptism into is
[1:52:38] not the end-all
[1:52:43] now
[1:52:45] brother branham's labored on this
[1:52:48] nicolaitan Darren Ephesian age and he
[1:52:51] says God help me to make this real
[1:52:53] a bunch of Christians in a church like
[1:52:56] this now he points out his own church a
[1:52:58] bunch of Christians just like you
[1:53:00] they got formal
[1:53:02] and indifferent and pulled off and set
[1:53:06] themselves up an organization
[1:53:08] and then United in the Dark Ages with
[1:53:11] the state now remember it didn't have
[1:53:12] any papers
[1:53:14] it was only a spirit of organization
[1:53:17] and then in the night the state and the
[1:53:19] church become what Christian Church Holy
[1:53:22] Catholic churches the word Catholic
[1:53:24] means Universal the great Universal
[1:53:26] Christian church and called the people
[1:53:28] that spoke in tongues and shouted and
[1:53:31] healed the sick and so forth Heretics
[1:53:35] so I want you to look at this he said it
[1:53:37] started out with a bunch of Christians
[1:53:40] just like this
[1:53:42] they got formal and indifferent and
[1:53:45] pulled off all message believers
[1:53:49] amen all listening to tapes
[1:53:52] all of them saying Branham Branham
[1:53:56] amen and you know they they got
[1:53:59] indifferent
[1:54:01] and and formal
[1:54:04] and then they began to call the people
[1:54:07] that spoke with tongues and shouted and
[1:54:09] healed the sick Heretics
[1:54:13] and finally made it so constraneous
[1:54:15] until anybody was caught worshiping that
[1:54:18] way was throwing the Lions being that
[1:54:19] they wouldn't Embrace Catholicism and
[1:54:22] that went on for these hundreds of years
[1:54:24] back there like that of persecution and
[1:54:26] that church never died you can't kill it
[1:54:29] God said it would live to them and he's
[1:54:31] given a crown of life so I'm going to
[1:54:33] tell you I'm warning you devil you can't
[1:54:35] kill us
[1:54:37] you can't stop us
[1:54:39] there's going to be an end time people
[1:54:41] no matter how impossible it looks
[1:54:45] Hallelujah no matter how long the
[1:54:48] promise has been delayed God promised a
[1:54:51] restoration
[1:54:52] there'll be a people who are changed by
[1:54:56] this message and restored back to the
[1:54:59] original
[1:55:00] that's what the message does
[1:55:03] that's what the son of man came to do
[1:55:09] then he says then I come Martin Luther
[1:55:12] to continue the age and he swung the
[1:55:14] church out under justification what
[1:55:16] happened when Luther died they organized
[1:55:18] and made a Lutheran Church they got a
[1:55:19] Doctrine when they organized it what
[1:55:21] they do it gave birth right back into
[1:55:23] romanism again didn't come Wesley and
[1:55:26] Whitfield and George Whitfield and many
[1:55:28] others in Asbury and many of them was
[1:55:31] great revivalists they saved the world
[1:55:34] in that day they had a Revival in that
[1:55:36] Philadelphian age that saved to England
[1:55:38] and the United States too they had
[1:55:41] meetings where they were kicked out and
[1:55:44] called Holy Rollers you methodists was
[1:55:47] done that they'd throw
[1:55:49] they'd fall in the floor under the power
[1:55:52] of God
[1:55:53] and they would throw water in their face
[1:55:55] and fan them that's right and they
[1:55:58] jerked so hard to they said they had the
[1:56:00] jerks
[1:56:01] and they there was people who would jerk
[1:56:03] and Shake under the power of the Holy
[1:56:05] Ghost that's Methodist history from
[1:56:08] there come the Quakers and so forth and
[1:56:11] now they organized it now notice they
[1:56:15] organized a movement against the Holy
[1:56:18] Ghost
[1:56:19] and put it all the Holy Spirit upon the
[1:56:22] clergy where they were to administer the
[1:56:25] holy ghost in a formal way of believing
[1:56:30] when you believe what I say is the truth
[1:56:34] you have the Holy Ghost
[1:56:37] so again it is a clergy
[1:56:40] controlling who receives the Holy Ghost
[1:56:46] and it's not an experience with you and
[1:56:48] God alone it's you and a minister
[1:56:51] as you agree to what he says
[1:56:55] then you have the Holy Spirit if you
[1:56:58] receive my Doctrine
[1:57:01] so you see and instead of experience God
[1:57:04] for yourself then the Holy Ghost becomes
[1:57:08] something administered by the clergy
[1:57:10] instead of an experience coming down
[1:57:13] upon you of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:16] now the doctrines of the Nicolaitans was
[1:57:18] a false revelation
[1:57:21] it was not with the word and and they
[1:57:23] called them Liars they call them false
[1:57:26] Apostles and false prophets
[1:57:28] so the true church held on to the
[1:57:31] original teaching of Saint Paul and the
[1:57:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost with signs
[1:57:37] following and confirming the word that
[1:57:39] Paul taught
[1:57:40] amen show me where God will ever Colonel
[1:57:43] confirmed the word of sprinkling now he
[1:57:45] starts with different words
[1:57:47] that the clergy is teaching and he's he
[1:57:51] said now let's see if God will confirm
[1:57:53] that
[1:57:54] so he said show me where God will ever
[1:57:56] confirm the word of sprinkling show me
[1:57:58] where God will ever confirm and bring
[1:58:01] speaking in tongues and great things
[1:58:03] just by shaking hands with the pastor
[1:58:05] somewhere or putting your name on a book
[1:58:07] and still chewing smoke and drink in
[1:58:10] line telling lies a card party is having
[1:58:12] a little fun going oh mercy that's
[1:58:14] carnal false prophet friends
[1:58:17] so it produces no cure for sin
[1:58:23] only treatment for sin
[1:58:28] you see some psychology
[1:58:31] some encouraging words
[1:58:33] just a pat on the back a little prayer
[1:58:36] told the girl a little more hey it ain't
[1:58:38] working
[1:58:39] people are still in porn still feeding
[1:58:42] them movies still telling continue
[1:58:44] telling lies
[1:58:46] you hear me
[1:58:47] the question came up in the Bible is
[1:58:49] there no Obama Gilead is there no
[1:58:52] physician there said the prophet then
[1:58:54] why is the disease of my daughter not
[1:58:57] healed what's the matter with the church
[1:58:59] what's the matter we got too many old
[1:59:02] sick churches
[1:59:03] because we have had quack drugs
[1:59:10] and now even in their message they're
[1:59:14] giving out the prescription wrong
[1:59:20] now what did this prescription say you
[1:59:22] know what it said Peter he was given the
[1:59:25] keys right
[1:59:27] amen give him the keys the kingdom he's
[1:59:29] got the ink pen to write the
[1:59:30] prescription
[1:59:32] amen Peter you're going to write it
[1:59:35] and I'm going to give you I'm going to
[1:59:36] give you the prescription the keys to
[1:59:38] the kingdom and he said when they heard
[1:59:41] this all nice to Broad this was
[1:59:43] screaming and shouting speaking in
[1:59:45] tongues and and having such a time they
[1:59:47] said these men are full of new wine and
[1:59:50] Peter said these are not full of new
[1:59:52] wine as you suppose see in this third
[1:59:54] hour today but this is that was spoken
[1:59:56] by the prophet Joel it'll come to pass
[1:59:59] in the last day I'll pour out my spirit
[2:00:01] upon All Flesh your sons and your
[2:00:03] daughters shall prophesy and upon my
[2:00:05] hands made my maid servants will I pour
[2:00:07] out my spirit and they shall prophesy
[2:00:10] also signs in the heavens above the
[2:00:12] earth below firing smoking paper and
[2:00:14] said them to pass it whosoever shall
[2:00:16] call on the name of the Lord shall be
[2:00:18] saved and furthermore what do you say
[2:00:20] about David the patriarch David
[2:00:22] foresight he saw said Boy Over My Flesh
[2:00:25] shall rests in Hope because he'll not
[2:00:27] leave my soul in Hell neither will he
[2:00:30] suffer his holy one to seek corruption
[2:00:32] let me speak to you Brethren of
[2:00:34] patriarch David he's both dead and
[2:00:36] buried his sepulchers with us to this
[2:00:38] day but he being a prophet saw the
[2:00:40] resurrection of Christ let it be known
[2:00:42] to you that this Jesus whom you have
[2:00:45] crucified with Wicked hands have made
[2:00:48] God it made him both Lord and Christ
[2:00:52] and when they heard this they were
[2:00:55] pricked in their heart and said men and
[2:00:57] Brethren or Dr Simon Peter write us a
[2:01:01] prescription
[2:01:02] how can we get this we want a cure for
[2:01:05] sin now watch him what he said and
[2:01:08] you'll find out where the church has got
[2:01:09] off track wait a minute I'm going to
[2:01:11] write your prescription it's going to be
[2:01:13] Eternal prescription it'll be for you to
[2:01:16] your children to them that are far off
[2:01:19] that as many as the Lord Our God shall
[2:01:22] call
[2:01:23] amen and he said what did he say how did
[2:01:26] he fix it how did Peter fix or prepare
[2:01:29] the prescription
[2:01:32] think of it
[2:01:34] day of Pentecost repent
[2:01:38] how are you going to get this experience
[2:01:40] of that looks like new wine
[2:01:43] how are you going to be filled with the
[2:01:44] Holy Ghost repent
[2:01:46] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:01:48] and you shall receive the gift of the
[2:01:51] Holy Ghost or the Holy Ghost as a gift
[2:01:54] the person will come unto you
[2:01:57] come on church amen and this is your
[2:02:00] promise
[2:02:02] write as many as the Lord Our God shall
[2:02:04] call to the last one called that Eternal
[2:02:08] prescription is in effect
[2:02:16] how did he fix he said like the
[2:02:17] Catholics did it
[2:02:19] you say you know they fixed up a
[2:02:21] prescription with infant baptism you
[2:02:23] know you don't you you you're born into
[2:02:26] the Catholic Church by natural birth so
[2:02:29] you're born into the church
[2:02:31] and then of course at Communion when you
[2:02:34] take to wafer you receive the Holy Ghost
[2:02:37] that's how they prepare the prescription
[2:02:42] does it bring life
[2:02:43] does it pure sin no you know he says
[2:02:47] like the Baptists have it like the
[2:02:49] methodists have it so the Methodist and
[2:02:51] Baptists they fixed it
[2:02:54] when the Methodist got ashamed of the
[2:02:56] emotion
[2:02:57] listen to me
[2:02:59] and they wanted to dress up the church
[2:03:03] they want to you know make it a little
[2:03:05] more refined and a little more
[2:03:08] you know acceptable to everybody I mean
[2:03:11] this screaming and falling out under the
[2:03:13] spirit and and jerking under the power
[2:03:16] we can't have that happening in our
[2:03:18] meetings
[2:03:19] so they begin to
[2:03:23] fix a prescription
[2:03:25] and the they
[2:03:28] they when they got ashamed of motion
[2:03:31] brother Brandon said those methodists
[2:03:33] that fell on the floor and they throwed
[2:03:36] water in their face from the spirit
[2:03:38] striking them through
[2:03:40] sanctification
[2:03:43] and so they fix it we don't need the
[2:03:46] spirit
[2:03:47] just join the church
[2:03:50] just seek ends with the preacher and
[2:03:54] make a confession of faith
[2:03:57] and that became their prescription
[2:04:01] but it doesn't keep them from the death
[2:04:04] angel
[2:04:05] look what's happening in methodism today
[2:04:09] look at the right in their pulpits women
[2:04:11] preachers lesbians homosexuals every
[2:04:14] time an interviews
[2:04:17] they they can't keep from sinning
[2:04:21] they even preach you can't stop sinning
[2:04:24] because they have no sin cure
[2:04:29] because they've messed with the
[2:04:31] prescription they are quack druggist
[2:04:35] will you say Amen to that
[2:04:37] now brother Branham said every one of
[2:04:40] them has added something or taken
[2:04:42] something from it
[2:04:44] like the Pentecostals they added or took
[2:04:46] away and we know what they did they
[2:04:49] added a requirement to speak for tongues
[2:04:51] until they forced the members to speak
[2:04:53] with tongues and when when some couldn't
[2:04:55] they just taught him how
[2:05:00] Pentecostals took the initial evidence
[2:05:02] of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues it
[2:05:05] got them down the Altar and made them
[2:05:07] say something over and over until they
[2:05:08] spoke in tongues they and so they took
[2:05:12] again a Creed a Dogma
[2:05:17] over receiving the person of Christ
[2:05:22] and again it was something controlled
[2:05:25] and imparted by the ministry
[2:05:28] who would teach you how to receive the
[2:05:32] Holy Ghost by having you jabber words
[2:05:38] now
[2:05:40] the message people hadn't been so
[2:05:42] squeaky clean either
[2:05:45] I'm coming down to home now
[2:05:48] oh we have a restored truth
[2:05:50] and our truth
[2:05:52] the restored truth is now receiving the
[2:05:55] Holy Ghost without sensation
[2:05:57] that's what it is
[2:06:00] so you know it's without feeling it's
[2:06:02] without anything happening
[2:06:06] you know you don't know when it comes
[2:06:09] you don't
[2:06:10] you just you just believe what we're
[2:06:13] preaching is the truth
[2:06:16] so it's again nicolaitanism
[2:06:20] administering the Holy Ghost
[2:06:25] you know you hear him say oh the Jews
[2:06:30] the Jews did receive it with emotion but
[2:06:33] that's not how the Gentiles received it
[2:06:36] this is they say you well the Gentiles
[2:06:38] they received the Holy Ghost as Peter
[2:06:41] spoke this word without any emotions now
[2:06:43] that ain't Bible
[2:06:45] that's preached from pulpits but that
[2:06:47] ain't Bible
[2:06:48] let me read what the Bible said about
[2:06:50] the house of Cornelia and the Gentiles
[2:06:52] and when it went to them and while Peter
[2:06:54] spoke these words acts 10 44 while Peter
[2:06:57] spoke these words the Holy Ghost fell on
[2:07:01] them which heard the word and they are
[2:07:04] the circumcision was believed were
[2:07:05] astonished as many as come with Peter
[2:07:08] because that on the Gentiles also was
[2:07:11] poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:07:13] for they heard them speak with tongues
[2:07:16] and magnify God
[2:07:24] so it didn't come
[2:07:26] without sensation to the Gentiles
[2:07:30] without feeling
[2:07:32] without anything happening
[2:07:35] you see that is not listen listen to me
[2:07:38] I want you to be very careful how you
[2:07:40] hear this that is not a restored truth
[2:07:44] that is a demonic
[2:07:46] nicolaitan dumb
[2:07:48] of the Baptist Methodist Catholic Church
[2:07:51] of Christ that is their Dogma that you
[2:07:55] receive the Holy Ghost without sensation
[2:07:57] you just believe and you got it
[2:08:01] you don't need a sensation no experience
[2:08:03] with God is necessary you just receive
[2:08:05] our Creed you decide to receive I
[2:08:07] believe you believe that Jesus Christ
[2:08:09] the son of God and he says he's the
[2:08:11] savior of the world you've got the Holy
[2:08:12] Ghost when you believe it
[2:08:16] and we bring it right down to the
[2:08:18] message the same old demonic Doctrine
[2:08:21] and say while you hear the word preached
[2:08:24] while this Doctrine is going forth right
[2:08:27] in your seat you're getting the Holy
[2:08:29] Ghost
[2:08:30] and the evidence is because you believe
[2:08:32] the word
[2:08:36] that I'm saying
[2:08:41] so again we have nicolaitan and the
[2:08:43] pulpits
[2:08:45] in message pulpets
[2:08:48] now you see where this puts us
[2:08:52] it puts the spirit the power of the
[2:08:54] spirit under the administration of a
[2:08:57] Preacher
[2:08:58] where as he releases his Doctrine you
[2:09:01] get the Holy Ghost
[2:09:04] instead of receiving the spirit yourself
[2:09:06] through the administration of the spirit
[2:09:09] coming to you as an individual as you
[2:09:11] yield yourself to it
[2:09:13] but I want you to say that that is a
[2:09:16] quote at least a partial quote you see
[2:09:18] that's the way the devil does it he
[2:09:21] comes along and gives you part of the
[2:09:23] word
[2:09:26] instead of all the word
[2:09:30] so finish the quote The Mystery of the
[2:09:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[2:09:35] sensation but the person of Jesus Christ
[2:09:38] in you the same Works performing in you
[2:09:43] the same works that he did
[2:09:46] so the mystery of the baptism of the
[2:09:49] Holy Ghost is the person of Christ
[2:09:52] not a sensation not a jump not a dance
[2:09:54] but the person of Christ performing in
[2:09:58] you the same works that he did
[2:10:01] what works did Jesus do after receiving
[2:10:05] the Holy Ghost well one thing he
[2:10:07] overcome the devil
[2:10:10] amen he also spoke in tongues he also
[2:10:13] prophesied he also healed the sick he
[2:10:16] also cast out devil it was more than a
[2:10:19] sensation
[2:10:21] amen it was more than a good feeling it
[2:10:25] was the power of an overcoming life
[2:10:28] among overcoming Temptation overcoming
[2:10:31] casting out Devils overcoming sickness
[2:10:33] and disease
[2:10:39] now in the palm of worm Locus and
[2:10:42] caterpillar brother Branham said there
[2:10:44] is no place in the Bible
[2:10:47] and you you can find this yourself no
[2:10:49] place in the Bible where they ever see
[2:10:51] the Holy Ghost without having a motion
[2:10:53] speaking with tongues and shouting and
[2:10:55] Praises of God and prophecies and
[2:10:56] manifestations they never did just walk
[2:11:00] up and shake hands with a preacher and
[2:11:01] walk away
[2:11:03] no place
[2:11:06] now let's carry it a little further on
[2:11:08] that
[2:11:10] he says now you can receive the Holy
[2:11:13] Ghost and maybe you didn't speak with
[2:11:16] tongues when you get it
[2:11:19] and that's true
[2:11:20] you can have the Holy Spirit and not
[2:11:22] have that manifestation
[2:11:25] but he said
[2:11:26] if you will just constantly lay there
[2:11:29] before God all the time with baptism
[2:11:32] after baptism striking you something's
[2:11:34] got to take place you get so full to you
[2:11:37] can't talk nothing else you just try to
[2:11:40] say something and you can't say it no
[2:11:42] more and you just can't say it and many
[2:11:44] times if people just realize that that
[2:11:46] was the Holy Spirit they just go ahead
[2:11:48] and just open up their heart and let God
[2:11:51] speak to them and he said I don't want
[2:11:53] his honor a great gift that God has
[2:11:54] given I believe that a Spirit-filled man
[2:11:57] or woman or child that lives under the
[2:11:59] altar of God won't live there long until
[2:12:02] they'll be speaking with tongues I
[2:12:04] believe he will do that or she
[2:12:08] amen so you know that's all I'd say lay
[2:12:11] under this under the spirit of God lay
[2:12:13] under the fountain
[2:12:16] till you get so full of the spirit of
[2:12:18] God
[2:12:19] till it bubbles over until it fulfills
[2:12:22] Joel 2 28. till it fulfills Isaiah 28
[2:12:27] 18.
[2:12:29] till it fulfills all the word of God
[2:12:31] come on everybody we ought to be a
[2:12:34] people that seeks to have everything
[2:12:36] every promise that God has to be
[2:12:39] manifested in our lives
[2:12:46] now brother Brandon would tell you this
[2:12:49] as he explains it in the foreseal and
[2:12:51] I'm not going to read it but he said you
[2:12:53] know he makes it clear it's not a
[2:12:55] Baptist idea of just believing on the
[2:12:57] Lord he said see Abraham believe God it
[2:13:00] was imputed to him for righteousness but
[2:13:03] God gave him a sign of circumcision as a
[2:13:06] confirmation he had accepted his face
[2:13:08] faith so that's the same thing we must
[2:13:11] do we must wait on the Holy Spirit till
[2:13:14] it's done something
[2:13:16] not necessarily because we spoke in
[2:13:18] tongues not because we've danced or we
[2:13:20] got emotional we shouted but until we're
[2:13:23] changed until something actually
[2:13:25] happened he said I don't care what form
[2:13:28] it comes in
[2:13:29] just so it happened
[2:13:31] that's the main thing
[2:13:34] so you see we're not trying to get
[2:13:36] somebody you got to speak in tongues or
[2:13:38] you got to prophesy it don't matter what
[2:13:40] form it comes in as long as your life
[2:13:43] has been changed and you're a different
[2:13:46] person and you got overcoming power in
[2:13:49] you come on now Christ's living in you
[2:13:54] and his person in your life is greater
[2:13:57] than having any gift to the spirit
[2:13:59] because you can have gifts of the Spirit
[2:14:01] and not have the spirit
[2:14:06] but the body of Believers that has the
[2:14:08] spirit will have gifts of the Spirit
[2:14:11] but what do you say repent every one of
[2:14:13] you and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:14:15] Christ for the mission of sins and you
[2:14:17] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:14:19] an eternal prescription is for you it's
[2:14:22] to your children that'll last through
[2:14:24] every Church age give it to every one of
[2:14:27] them so God wants us all to have that
[2:14:29] same prescription
[2:14:31] amen don't mess with it don't be a quack
[2:14:34] you see I wanted to say the baptism of
[2:14:38] the Holy Ghost is much more than a
[2:14:40] profession of faith
[2:14:42] it is the person of Jesus Christ
[2:14:46] amen you know it's my let me go back
[2:14:49] it's much more than just being justified
[2:14:53] and forgiven of your sin it's as much
[2:14:55] more than quit drinking and smoking or
[2:14:58] doping it is much more than exercising
[2:15:01] the gift of the spirit it is the person
[2:15:03] of Christ
[2:15:05] coming to live in Tabernacle on the
[2:15:09] inside of you so that you living the
[2:15:12] life anymore it ain't you trying anymore
[2:15:17] if you're still trying you're still
[2:15:20] under the law
[2:15:22] [Applause]
[2:15:24] but if you're under grace it's because
[2:15:26] you have received the spirit of God and
[2:15:29] the spirit of God brings your members
[2:15:31] your hands your feet your mouth your
[2:15:33] mind subject to the word of God
[2:15:37] Hallelujah and it's your evidence that
[2:15:40] you're going in the rapture
[2:15:48] so you see it's not just a sin's face
[2:15:52] not just a good feeling not just an
[2:15:55] emotion
[2:15:57] it's a person of Christ
[2:16:00] and though listen carefully
[2:16:03] though it was is not a sensation
[2:16:07] it don't come without emotion
[2:16:10] it never has and it never will
[2:16:14] it doesn't come without feeling
[2:16:16] it never has and never will
[2:16:19] you'll never get the Holy Ghost and not
[2:16:21] know it
[2:16:25] unless you're doctrinally confused
[2:16:28] and then you wonder and Ponder
[2:16:30] but brother Branham after they says this
[2:16:33] about Sin you know the Holy Ghost
[2:16:35] without sensation in in God and
[2:16:37] simplicity as the seals open God
[2:16:40] unfolded himself not in Sensations no
[2:16:43] but Sensations yet with it
[2:16:48] is not a sensation
[2:16:50] sensation comes with it
[2:16:53] Again The Sixth Seal it is an emotion
[2:16:58] though a motion accompanies it
[2:17:02] see the difference it's not it's not the
[2:17:04] emotion but emotion does accompany it
[2:17:06] and then he says in a paradox emotions
[2:17:09] screaming crying and so forth cannot be
[2:17:12] explained but it's a paradox how God
[2:17:14] does it it's the Unseen God dwelling in
[2:17:17] the human heart making himself visible
[2:17:19] by vindicating his word that he's the
[2:17:22] same yesterday today and forever so you
[2:17:24] see it's it's a miracle he's an emotions
[2:17:28] screaming crying cannot be explained
[2:17:30] it's a paradox a miracle how God does it
[2:17:35] now man can manufacture it
[2:17:38] and man can impersonate the sensation
[2:17:42] but they can't impersonate the
[2:17:45] indwelling of the spirit of God
[2:17:47] Hallelujah because that is God himself
[2:17:51] coming to that Tabernacle the human
[2:17:53] being
[2:17:54] amen
[2:17:56] and brother Bradham said again in the
[2:17:59] world falling apart you people standing
[2:18:01] here that was at the altar now look
[2:18:04] don't you rely upon some emotion
[2:18:06] although it has emotion in it
[2:18:14] now the ripened seed
[2:18:17] the grain the mature Church
[2:18:21] will bring Christ back like he was at
[2:18:23] the beginning but this time he will be
[2:18:25] in Bride form
[2:18:28] so in the Mighty God unveiled brother
[2:18:30] Brandon said it's right to bring him
[2:18:32] back just exactly like he was in the
[2:18:34] beginning his same Ministry
[2:18:37] somebody say same Ministry
[2:18:40] all right let's try this the same Jesus
[2:18:43] amen the same power
[2:18:45] the same Holy Ghost
[2:18:48] the same one that came down on the day
[2:18:50] of Pentecost
[2:18:52] amen that is the same holy ghost that is
[2:18:55] manifested today from glory to glory to
[2:18:57] glory and it's not back to his Original
[2:19:00] Seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:19:02] with the same signs
[2:19:05] same signs same wonders
[2:19:08] amen same baptism
[2:19:11] same kind of people
[2:19:13] acting the same way
[2:19:15] with the same power
[2:19:17] the same sensation it's from glory to
[2:19:21] glory and the next will be changed from
[2:19:24] this Glory into a body like his own
[2:19:27] voice body what we shall see him
[2:19:32] Hallelujah he said Abraham saw this
[2:19:36] this is what Abraham saw this is what
[2:19:39] Sarah saw
[2:19:40] [Applause]
[2:19:51] well
[2:19:53] but that's out of church order
[2:19:56] well
[2:19:58] brother Brandon said I've seen jumping
[2:19:59] spells
[2:20:00] and joy spells and nobody was hurt
[2:20:04] the mountains rung out and the sun went
[2:20:06] down and everything took place but
[2:20:07] nobody there was nobody hurt
[2:20:09] and I've seen meetings where the power
[2:20:12] of God was revealed to the people that
[2:20:14] they were free from the world and the
[2:20:16] things of the world and the joy the Lord
[2:20:18] filled the congregation and they stood
[2:20:20] and screamed and cried and shouted to
[2:20:22] the top of their voice for the glory of
[2:20:24] God I never did see anything disorderly
[2:20:27] there was always right in order because
[2:20:30] they had recognized that their name had
[2:20:33] been written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:20:36] from the foundation of the world
[2:20:39] Hallelujah that's what gives us joy we
[2:20:43] recognize
[2:20:46] that's why we cry have a father father
[2:20:50] and you say you son I'm not a child of
[2:20:54] the world I'm not a child of sin but not
[2:20:57] a child of utterly I'm a child of the
[2:20:59] Living God
[2:21:09] Hallelujah
[2:21:14] now nowhere in the Bible
[2:21:18] did they just receive the Holy Ghost and
[2:21:21] not know it
[2:21:22] when but instead when they were filled
[2:21:26] with the spirit
[2:21:27] all glorified God
[2:21:30] every time
[2:21:32] here's what they had in common
[2:21:34] people you know
[2:21:36] bless their hearts the Azusa people it
[2:21:39] was at um in Kansas before it come to
[2:21:42] Azusa they had a they had a school there
[2:21:47] and they were studying the book of Acts
[2:21:49] and they were excited and they were
[2:21:51] praying that there would be another book
[2:21:53] of Acts and they'd get the Holy Ghost
[2:21:55] like they did in the book of Acts
[2:21:57] and they brother part of him I believe
[2:22:00] it was some brother brother Parham had
[2:22:03] had instructed them now look I want you
[2:22:06] to study the Bible to see if there's
[2:22:08] anything in common
[2:22:11] if they all have something in common
[2:22:14] when they initially received the Holy
[2:22:17] Ghost
[2:22:18] and so they went to studying and the
[2:22:22] students come up with uh what they
[2:22:25] believed an answer three out of the five
[2:22:28] times that they received the Holy Ghost
[2:22:31] they spoke with other tongues in other
[2:22:33] languages
[2:22:35] so they made this the initial sign
[2:22:40] that you had been filled with the Holy
[2:22:42] Ghost based on three out of five times
[2:22:46] the Holy Ghost came
[2:22:49] that they spoke in tongues
[2:22:52] this became a dogma and it caused people
[2:22:55] even even daddy Seymour warned him do
[2:23:00] not seek for tongues
[2:23:02] seek to receive the spirit he said if I
[2:23:05] go down to a store and I want a pair of
[2:23:09] shoes I don't ask for tongues
[2:23:12] I asked for the shoe and the tongue
[2:23:15] comes with the shoe
[2:23:18] now that was the that was the
[2:23:20] Pentecostal fathers realizing the
[2:23:22] fallacy of seeking the gift without The
[2:23:25] Giver
[2:23:26] and they went astray anyway and they
[2:23:29] built an organization on that and that
[2:23:31] became the Dogma
[2:23:33] were that you have Pentecostals who will
[2:23:36] speak in tongues and they declare I've
[2:23:39] got the Holy Ghost and living a
[2:23:42] undoubtly life
[2:23:46] because they had the initial evidence
[2:23:48] I'm now saved don't you dare bother that
[2:23:52] either they you dare tell them that that
[2:23:54] the Holy Ghost is not the evidence
[2:23:56] they'll curse you to their face to your
[2:23:59] face
[2:24:00] you're not taking that from them
[2:24:03] you know it's their anchor it's their is
[2:24:06] it's it's their typos
[2:24:09] and so this is what they believe no
[2:24:11] matter what kind of Life they live just
[2:24:13] come back and speak in tongues again
[2:24:15] we're going backslide every day we can't
[2:24:17] help it we can't overcome we can't live
[2:24:18] the life you know we're gonna we're
[2:24:20] gonna make mistakes like that and we're
[2:24:22] just going hey if you slip and go back
[2:24:24] to drink just come back and speak and
[2:24:25] tell you if you go out you know
[2:24:27] backslide long enough you wanna you you
[2:24:30] want a different husband backslide a
[2:24:31] little bit and go out and find you
[2:24:33] another man and then come back and speak
[2:24:35] in tongues you're okay
[2:24:39] and that's what happened
[2:24:42] but nowhere
[2:24:44] nowhere in the Bible
[2:24:46] did they speak or did they have the Holy
[2:24:49] Ghost and not know it instead they were
[2:24:52] filled with the spirit and I want you to
[2:24:54] get this
[2:24:55] oh glorified God
[2:25:00] and I don't care what the language you
[2:25:03] glorify men
[2:25:06] here's what you want to see in your life
[2:25:09] that your life glorifies Jesus Christ
[2:25:18] well I I dance in the spirit by the Tim
[2:25:22] two hours I spoken I I don't care
[2:25:24] nothing about that I won't see one thing
[2:25:26] in your life here's the evidence I want
[2:25:29] to see that from now on
[2:25:32] amen this is your typos your life
[2:25:36] verifies Jesus Christ
[2:25:39] [Applause]
[2:25:43] Hallelujah
[2:25:46] now
[2:25:48] so you see
[2:25:51] they would speak in other languages and
[2:25:54] even when they spoke in other languages
[2:25:55] they were heard in those languages
[2:25:58] glorifying God
[2:26:01] it fulfilled
[2:26:03] the scripture Peter said it did
[2:26:06] how many believes that
[2:26:08] it fulfilled come on Peter said this is
[2:26:11] that don't shut down on me this is
[2:26:13] Sunday morning
[2:26:16] amen and we you know I preached twice in
[2:26:20] a week both times on Sunday
[2:26:24] Timothy does his hour on
[2:26:26] on
[2:26:28] Wednesday night or brother Joe or
[2:26:30] brother Aaron they do their hour on wins
[2:26:32] tonight
[2:26:33] I do my hours Sunday starting somewhere
[2:26:36] just before 12 and Sunday morning
[2:26:39] I do my second hour in the afternoon
[2:26:42] now we could take a break and come back
[2:26:46] but we're doing it like this we're
[2:26:48] putting them all together now hang on
[2:26:50] now for me
[2:26:51] don't quit and go home on me
[2:26:54] I ain't true
[2:26:56] you see it fulfilled the scripture
[2:26:59] notice the experience had to match the
[2:27:03] word
[2:27:04] is that right it fulfilled Joel 2 Peter
[2:27:07] said it did this is that
[2:27:09] which the prophet Joel said he you know
[2:27:12] where he said my he would pour out his
[2:27:14] spirit and my sons and daughters shall
[2:27:17] prophesy
[2:27:19] you see their lives would glorify God
[2:27:24] it fulfilled Isaiah's prophecy that was
[2:27:27] stubborn lips and other tongues of
[2:27:29] spirit spoke to them through them to the
[2:27:32] people and it took cowards and made them
[2:27:36] Brave
[2:27:37] somebody help me preach I'm talking
[2:27:39] about men and women that were hiding up
[2:27:41] in an upper room come spilling out
[2:27:45] and they're not ashamed of what is went
[2:27:47] on
[2:27:48] Hallelujah but they're they're
[2:27:50] emboldened by what is going on Amen that
[2:27:53] they are now declaring everywhere that
[2:27:56] Jesus Christ is alive he is resurrected
[2:28:00] from the dead and he's now living in me
[2:28:09] it took cowards and made them Brave it
[2:28:14] took deniers of Christ and made them
[2:28:17] speak boldly and Proclaim Christ it took
[2:28:20] a liar like Peter and made him Proclaim
[2:28:23] truth it cured sin
[2:28:27] it took Sanctified men and women
[2:28:30] and fill them with the spirit until they
[2:28:33] were drunk
[2:28:34] as if they had taken wine
[2:28:38] now this is what it did
[2:28:41] now
[2:28:42] don't stop it
[2:28:44] don't stop it that's what I'm saying
[2:28:45] don't stop it let it come through
[2:28:49] let it come through
[2:28:51] let it you know how you some people are
[2:28:53] afraid of the sensation I'm not afraid
[2:28:56] of this sensation but go beyond the
[2:28:58] sensation
[2:29:00] Let It Go through until you get the Holy
[2:29:02] Ghost
[2:29:03] so I prayed until I got a feeling I'm
[2:29:05] glad for the feeling but until your life
[2:29:09] has changed keep pressing through
[2:29:12] don't give up
[2:29:15] brother Branham talks about this and the
[2:29:17] Methodist he said Wesley had a Revival
[2:29:20] the people would fall out in the floor
[2:29:22] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:29:25] and they'd pour water in their face
[2:29:28] and fan them till they'd lay all night
[2:29:31] on the floor till too bad you had
[2:29:33] pictures of waters you might have come
[2:29:35] through
[2:29:38] he said Wesley the Holy Ghost could have
[2:29:41] fallen before Azusa Street
[2:29:45] but they stopped it
[2:29:48] he said too bad you had pictures of
[2:29:50] water
[2:29:51] because it didn't get praying they would
[2:29:54] have got through
[2:29:56] um
[2:29:57] amen they poured water in his face and
[2:29:59] Shake him oh he's fainted he's fainted
[2:30:01] the Holy Ghost working on it it wasn't
[2:30:03] the age yet to know these things
[2:30:06] and why little Bethlehem he said it'd
[2:30:08] been better at the Methodist looked back
[2:30:10] to their old days their good old days
[2:30:12] when they were few and far between and
[2:30:14] little school houses and out here in
[2:30:17] America Fallen under the power of God
[2:30:19] throwing water in her face it'd be
[2:30:20] better for you Baptists look back where
[2:30:22] you come from too and the rest of you
[2:30:24] Pentecost will look back where you come
[2:30:25] from door in the door in um in 63 he
[2:30:30] said the methodists were like the
[2:30:32] Pentecostals has been a bunch of
[2:30:34] fanatics
[2:30:35] that lay in the school houses and fall
[2:30:38] out
[2:30:39] under the power of God and pour water on
[2:30:41] their face and don't tell me I've been
[2:30:44] right in the meetings see if they didn't
[2:30:46] just let them alone instead of bringing
[2:30:49] them back just let them gone on they
[2:30:52] would have been Pentecostals
[2:30:56] and how kind of overcome brother Bradham
[2:30:58] talks about this is the age of the
[2:31:01] personal life
[2:31:03] now I want to get this
[2:31:04] the age of the personal life is not just
[2:31:08] a restoration of the gift this is where
[2:31:10] the life comes
[2:31:12] not the gift the life
[2:31:14] but the life has the gifts
[2:31:16] don't don't forget the grain has
[2:31:19] everything in it
[2:31:23] don't call yourself grains and you say
[2:31:25] we don't believe in tongues and gifts of
[2:31:26] the Spirit and you're not grain
[2:31:29] you're back over here in the Baptist age
[2:31:32] you hadn't even Advanced as far as Azusa
[2:31:34] Street you're backslidden that far
[2:31:38] are you with me
[2:31:40] but this is the age of life
[2:31:43] personal life of Christ where you must
[2:31:46] have his life
[2:31:48] for he said we're living in the shadows
[2:31:51] and the Wrath is ready to strike and God
[2:31:53] is requiring a token that you yourself
[2:31:55] have received this token the Holy Ghost
[2:31:58] and it is the only way and the only sign
[2:32:00] that God will ever pass because it is
[2:32:03] the literal life of Jesus Christ
[2:32:05] returned back into the believer so this
[2:32:08] is it the literal life
[2:32:11] not a gift to the spirit
[2:32:13] I've explained before don't have a thing
[2:32:15] to give okay so if I give a gift to this
[2:32:19] microphone here brother Aaron
[2:32:21] you see that's a gift I gave him he has
[2:32:24] a gift in his hand that's from me I gave
[2:32:27] it to him
[2:32:28] but that's not me
[2:32:30] he can have that gift but he doesn't
[2:32:32] have me
[2:32:35] amen now one day at an altar I'm I and a
[2:32:40] pretty little girl came together
[2:32:42] and we stood at an altar and we made
[2:32:44] vows to each other and she gave her
[2:32:47] herself to me as a gift
[2:32:51] now the two of us became one
[2:32:54] there was no longer just one Tim Pruitt
[2:32:57] there were two of them there was Tim in
[2:33:00] the groom form and Tim and bride form
[2:33:04] for a long time you know she signed her
[2:33:06] they missed him Pruitt because she had
[2:33:08] taken on my name she was identified with
[2:33:12] me and the bride of Christ and Christ
[2:33:15] are one amen they are not one in the
[2:33:19] sense of one person they are one because
[2:33:22] Christ is in them
[2:33:25] amen so Christ comes into us as a gift
[2:33:29] so we receive not not a gift of the
[2:33:33] spirit that's charismata you know we're
[2:33:36] gifts of the Spirit tongues
[2:33:37] interpretations uh heal his faith those
[2:33:40] are gifts of the Spirit that's not the
[2:33:42] spirit that the gifts of the Spirit the
[2:33:45] spirit is Jesus Christ himself the life
[2:33:49] that was in him poured out at Calvary
[2:33:52] come back on the day of Pentecost and
[2:33:55] field 120 in the upper room and they
[2:33:58] received the personal life of Jesus
[2:34:01] Christ that's what the Holy Ghost is
[2:34:04] that's what it was then that's what it
[2:34:07] is today
[2:34:11] and when you receive the Holy Ghost you
[2:34:14] are receiving deity in your life
[2:34:19] now so he said
[2:34:22] it is the literal life of Jesus Christ
[2:34:24] returned back into the believer
[2:34:27] now the token message
[2:34:30] brother Branham told us
[2:34:32] now the blood that was shed at Calvary
[2:34:34] bathed on the ground we have the token
[2:34:36] of the blood which is the baptism of the
[2:34:39] Holy Ghost is to identify us as
[2:34:41] Believers so it is
[2:34:44] and let me just challenge you
[2:34:46] go back and listen to the Token message
[2:34:49] and when you do hear token
[2:34:52] seem like people get in
[2:34:55] it's almost makes it an oblivious term
[2:35:00] and so they just came over every time
[2:35:02] you see token say holy ghost
[2:35:05] because the token is the Holy Ghost
[2:35:08] and everywhere brother Branham is saying
[2:35:10] token he is talking about the Holy Ghost
[2:35:15] so he said he said now
[2:35:18] um the blood that was shedded cow were
[2:35:20] bathed on the ground now we have the
[2:35:21] token of the blood which is the baptism
[2:35:24] of the Holy Ghost to identify us as
[2:35:27] believers
[2:35:29] and these signs shall follow them that
[2:35:31] believe not just professors but
[2:35:33] identified believers they may not follow
[2:35:36] they probably will that perhaps they
[2:35:37] will Jesus said they shall follow them
[2:35:40] that believe just absolutely impossible
[2:35:43] for it not to happen the works that I do
[2:35:47] shall do also that's the identification
[2:35:49] Jesus identification was to manifest the
[2:35:52] word of God which he was and the
[2:35:55] church's identification today is to
[2:35:57] manifest the promised word of this day
[2:35:59] by The Same Spirit that was manifested
[2:36:02] and quickened the word then the Same
[2:36:04] Spirit quickens the word to the believer
[2:36:06] today and manifests the same thing
[2:36:08] showing that the token
[2:36:10] Holy Ghost is on this person which is a
[2:36:14] resurrected life of Jesus Christ Living
[2:36:17] in his believer oh that ought to accept
[2:36:20] the Church of fire and that's true just
[2:36:23] as true as it could be the water AIDS
[2:36:25] the blood age and now the token age
[2:36:28] of the Holy Ghost
[2:36:36] you know brother tell them sometimes I
[2:36:38] wish you'd just preached the message
[2:36:40] well the evening time message
[2:36:43] is to apply the token
[2:36:47] the Holy Ghost
[2:36:51] and the token is the Holy Ghost
[2:36:54] first under justification of water
[2:36:56] baptism second under the new birth of of
[2:36:58] Wesley sanctification which cleanses
[2:37:00] thirdly under the baptism of the Holy
[2:37:03] Spirit put it in that Sanctified vessels
[2:37:05] into service the word Sanctified means
[2:37:07] is a compound word which means cleaned
[2:37:09] and set aside for service set aside for
[2:37:11] service now the Holy Spirit puts it in
[2:37:14] service
[2:37:16] and we'll notice when the unclean spirit
[2:37:18] is coming from a man he walks in dry
[2:37:19] places that's exactly what the church
[2:37:22] has done Baptist methodists those who
[2:37:25] believe in sanctification
[2:37:26] then Jesus said the unclean spirit that
[2:37:29] went out returns back to this church
[2:37:31] body and finds the house garnished swept
[2:37:34] clean live Pure Living Pure Clean lives
[2:37:37] but if that house isn't filled and
[2:37:39] occupied when he comes in with seven
[2:37:41] other evil demons worse than he was and
[2:37:44] the last stage of this place is seven
[2:37:47] times worse than it was in the first
[2:37:50] place
[2:37:51] they've been better to stay Lutheran
[2:37:53] than it would be to receive that life
[2:37:55] and fail to follow so will the
[2:37:57] Pentecostals you know what I mean the
[2:37:59] house is garnished I was talking to
[2:38:01] somebody the other day said they're very
[2:38:03] careful
[2:38:04] many of these Holiness groups not to
[2:38:07] call the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost because
[2:38:11] they identify themselves with
[2:38:13] Pentecostals when they do that they say
[2:38:16] holy spirit
[2:38:18] seek to keep them saying Holy Ghost
[2:38:20] because the Pentecostal common people
[2:38:23] just call it what the Bible says holy
[2:38:27] ghost which Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost
[2:38:29] is the same thing but they're careful
[2:38:30] about it they don't want to be
[2:38:33] identified with them tongue-speaking
[2:38:35] people
[2:38:37] and that's the Holy Spirit itself
[2:38:40] see
[2:38:43] oh brother damn I wish you'd read us a
[2:38:45] quote after the seals that was after the
[2:38:47] seals
[2:38:50] what happened then when the enemy that
[2:38:53] went out under sanctification
[2:38:55] that was washed out and returned back
[2:38:58] and found the house not filled with the
[2:39:01] Holy Spirit he's talking about the
[2:39:02] church Methodist Nazarene and so on not
[2:39:04] filled with the Holy Spirit now the
[2:39:07] state of the church is joined with a
[2:39:09] league of churches worth World Council
[2:39:11] of churches it's an estate now that
[2:39:13] connects it to Roman Catholic
[2:39:14] Catholicism all the rest of it and now
[2:39:16] it's seven times worse than it was when
[2:39:19] it come out of Lutheranism
[2:39:21] brother L can tell you
[2:39:24] brother L can tell you that that's true
[2:39:26] that it's uh that it's seven times worse
[2:39:29] than what the Methodist today that when
[2:39:32] it came out of Luther
[2:39:34] seven times worse and the same thing the
[2:39:37] same thing happens with any of them when
[2:39:40] a house when a church is not filled with
[2:39:42] the spirit
[2:39:44] then they become seven times worse
[2:39:48] because all the sins of the past ages
[2:39:51] keep up into them until they are the
[2:39:54] rejecters
[2:39:56] of Jesus Christ
[2:39:58] in the laodicean age
[2:40:01] now brother Branham talks about this he
[2:40:05] says important
[2:40:07] that you get filled
[2:40:09] you've emptied out
[2:40:11] he said a man confess Christ as his
[2:40:13] savior got rid of his wickedness
[2:40:15] quit his drink and quit his smoke in his
[2:40:17] line and stealing becomes Sanctified and
[2:40:20] cleaned out his house was all swept he
[2:40:22] feels free
[2:40:24] he comes back and he found inside the
[2:40:26] house then he goes and gets seven other
[2:40:28] Spirits worse than he was and comes into
[2:40:29] this person the Bible said the last day
[2:40:32] to the man is worse than the first than
[2:40:34] it was at the beginning
[2:40:36] now what just happened an evangelists
[2:40:38] come through they preached repentance
[2:40:39] you clean up from your sins when you
[2:40:41] cleaned up the devil goes away from me
[2:40:42] you take back the things you stole you
[2:40:44] confess your wrongs your wife or your
[2:40:46] husband you really clean up and then the
[2:40:47] next thing of it is you're just clean
[2:40:51] and make a real good Target for the
[2:40:53] devil
[2:40:55] now after the people believed and were
[2:40:57] baptized they were filled with the Holy
[2:40:59] Spirit that's God's Divine program
[2:41:01] and when you're saved you might be
[2:41:03] filled with good thoughts
[2:41:04] and so forth are you but unless you are
[2:41:07] filled with God God sent the Holy Spirit
[2:41:09] to the Earth to motivate the church and
[2:41:12] you might be filled with thoughts you
[2:41:14] might be filled with theologies you
[2:41:15] might be filled with education I know it
[2:41:18] all and you might be filled with
[2:41:19] religion and still be a target of the
[2:41:21] devil
[2:41:24] thank you
[2:41:27] and you might be reading a Bible
[2:41:30] and you see where Jesus performed and
[2:41:31] done miracles
[2:41:33] and you take it to the pastor and he
[2:41:35] says oh now look we don't believe that
[2:41:37] he says we who's we who is we don't
[2:41:40] believe in him and who it isn't him and
[2:41:42] God God wrote it it's him and somebody
[2:41:44] else
[2:41:45] and if you're behind it it's the same
[2:41:47] motive that was at the Tower of Babel
[2:41:51] to build a man-made Earthly Dominion
[2:41:55] now so you see he said when the Holy
[2:41:59] Spirit comes the world becomes dead and
[2:42:01] you're filled with the baptism of the
[2:42:03] Holy Ghost and the devil
[2:42:05] is a person that has to stay away from
[2:42:09] you
[2:42:11] you are under God's domain you are a new
[2:42:14] creature the Holy Spirit come to that
[2:42:18] empty vessel and filled it up
[2:42:21] so that's what every person
[2:42:23] ought to be now don't just come this far
[2:42:25] and say well I believe the message
[2:42:27] the devil believes it too
[2:42:31] that's only being able to read
[2:42:34] you can read that no it's true and say I
[2:42:37] believe it you must have the token the
[2:42:40] Holy Ghost the very Life of Christ must
[2:42:43] be in you now let me come down to an end
[2:42:46] because I want to just I just want to
[2:42:48] finish here on on this one quote we'll
[2:42:51] come around to it
[2:42:53] now
[2:42:55] brother Branham deals with what is sin
[2:43:02] because there are people that don't
[2:43:04] drink
[2:43:05] don't smoke
[2:43:07] would never tell you a lie
[2:43:09] that are sinners
[2:43:14] and I want you to hear what he said
[2:43:16] about Sin
[2:43:18] are you ready
[2:43:20] because if the Holy Ghost comes
[2:43:22] he's going to deliver you from sin
[2:43:26] all right listen question answers
[2:43:31] and he reads the scripture whosoever is
[2:43:33] born of God does not commit sin
[2:43:37] and he says what is sin
[2:43:39] and explains unbelief that's what the
[2:43:42] Bible said there's only one sin that's
[2:43:43] unbelief that's right he that believeth
[2:43:46] not is condemned already
[2:43:49] so one will sin now you say well wait a
[2:43:52] minute
[2:43:53] I believe they might have got the Holy
[2:43:54] Ghost like that in them days but I don't
[2:43:57] believe it's so but brother the Bible
[2:43:59] said to promise to you and your children
[2:44:01] I know but
[2:44:02] listen brother Branham you are sinning
[2:44:06] you are sitting right there
[2:44:10] you're disbelieving what God Said
[2:44:14] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:44:16] and forever well now we're taught that
[2:44:18] he said I don't care what you're talking
[2:44:20] the Bible said let every man's word be
[2:44:23] alive might be true well principally
[2:44:25] he's the same you mean he's the same
[2:44:28] yeah in the church doing the same things
[2:44:30] he did with his ear well I can't believe
[2:44:32] that you are sinning
[2:44:35] you are sending he that's born of God of
[2:44:38] the Holy Ghost don't say those things
[2:44:41] and if he says he's got the Holy Ghost
[2:44:43] and says he'll say those things that's
[2:44:46] evidence he hasn't got it
[2:44:49] I don't care what he's done if you don't
[2:44:51] believe in Divine Healing he don't
[2:44:54] believe in the power the resurrection he
[2:44:56] don't believe in the Holy Ghost being
[2:44:58] poured out upon us just exactly like it
[2:45:00] did in the first stage just the same God
[2:45:02] yesterday today and forever the same
[2:45:05] things Apostles done happening how now
[2:45:07] speaking in tongues and rejoicing and
[2:45:10] all these other things that they don't
[2:45:12] believe that he's not born of God
[2:45:17] for whosoever is born of God does not
[2:45:20] commit those kinds of things that's how
[2:45:23] to tell
[2:45:24] whether they're born of God
[2:45:28] you walk up to a fellow and say p Dr pH
[2:45:31] so and so Reverend Dr so and so which is
[2:45:34] fine he said I wish I had it degrees
[2:45:37] but is it so Divine Healing should be
[2:45:40] carried on the church just like it was
[2:45:42] the apostles did oh no no no no he's
[2:45:46] sinning
[2:45:48] he's an unbeliever that's right you say
[2:45:51] Do you believe we receive the Holy Ghost
[2:45:53] like they did here I was reading over
[2:45:56] here in the in the Bible in Acts 2 where
[2:45:59] it said the the there were and poured
[2:46:02] out the Holy Ghost and they started like
[2:46:04] they were drunk and they went out and
[2:46:06] talked in the languages of those people
[2:46:09] and things like that and I said like
[2:46:10] people are drunk and the church thought
[2:46:12] they were drunk and we received when we
[2:46:14] received the Holy Ghost today in the
[2:46:16] Baptist Church of our baptism Methodist
[2:46:19] Presbyterian whatever it may be I don't
[2:46:22] see us doing that well I tell you a
[2:46:24] child that was just for them 12. he is a
[2:46:29] sinning
[2:46:30] he is not born of the spirit of God
[2:46:33] because the Bible said he that's born of
[2:46:35] the spirit of God does not disbelieve
[2:46:38] he is a Believer and he cannot why why
[2:46:40] oh here it is the dove is leading for
[2:46:44] the spirit of God is in him and he
[2:46:45] cannot deny it he cannot it's the spirit
[2:46:48] of God and God won't deny his own word
[2:46:51] if I deny my own word then I become a
[2:46:53] liar and if you say you got the spirit
[2:46:55] of God and deny the word of God it's
[2:46:57] either God's a liar are you a liar one
[2:46:59] or the other and the Bible said let
[2:47:01] every man's word be alive might be the
[2:47:03] truth and a man that's born of the
[2:47:05] spirit of God cannot disagree with God's
[2:47:07] word he's got to say it is right he
[2:47:11] can't do nothing else this is it this is
[2:47:13] the truth
[2:47:16] so he said let me read it again
[2:47:18] whosoever is born of God does not commit
[2:47:21] sin for the seed what is the seed of God
[2:47:24] the promise Abraham had the seed what is
[2:47:27] the seed now Christ is Christ the seed
[2:47:30] of God whose seed is he if he if he
[2:47:33] isn't all right he is the seated God the
[2:47:36] seed of God remaineth in him the Holy
[2:47:38] Ghost comes abide not from meeting the
[2:47:40] meeting but for Eternal and if you want
[2:47:43] to put that down in your scripture this
[2:47:45] Ephesians 4 30 greed not the holy spirit
[2:47:47] of God we're by your seal to the day of
[2:47:49] redemption the seed of God remains in
[2:47:51] him and he cannot sin because he's born
[2:47:53] of God he can't disbelieve God's word
[2:47:56] and when you see a man disagreeing with
[2:48:00] God's word and saying all that was for
[2:48:03] another age when the promises to
[2:48:06] whosoever will let him come remember he
[2:48:10] is an unbeliever and not a god
[2:48:17] you see
[2:48:18] nicolaitan
[2:48:20] take it
[2:48:22] The Experience from the people
[2:48:24] and have something administered only by
[2:48:27] the preacher
[2:48:30] believe my Doctrine then you got it
[2:48:33] believe what I'm preaching my Revelation
[2:48:36] then you got it believe believe me you
[2:48:40] know join the church just get baptized
[2:48:42] you got it
[2:48:44] nicolaitanism
[2:48:46] but we're in the hour of restoration
[2:48:51] Hallelujah amen for God said I will
[2:48:54] restore saith the Lord
[2:48:57] Sarah I don't care how long you've
[2:48:59] disbelieved
