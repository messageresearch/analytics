[42:20] other day where the prophet of god said
[42:22] he wanted to be the touchable god so he
[42:24] came down and became
[42:25] flesh that we could touch him and that
[42:27] we could fellowship with him and
[42:29] tell you this morning you're not serving
[42:30] a god that don't understand what we're
[42:32] going through this morning

[42:48] he's here to bless us let's just ask him
[42:50] to come heavenly father
[42:52] lord as your believers have gathered
[42:54] themselves together here this morning
[42:56] lord
[42:57] father i don't believe that we're just
[42:58] here because we woke up and it was
[43:00] sunday morning and we
[43:02] knew it was something we're supposed to
[43:03] do on sunday morning
[43:05] but father i believe we're here because
[43:07] there is a deep calling to the deep lord
[43:09] lord i believe there's a pull on the
[43:11] inside of every believer here this
[43:13] morning
[43:14] father some sending before me today have
[43:16] been serving you lord for many many
[43:18] years
[43:19] some or just a few years but lord we can
[43:22] all relate this morning
[43:23] father to how your prophet talked about
[43:25] something on the inside of us that was
[43:28] lord always different maybe as a child
[43:30] things that
[43:31] didn't bother others seemed to bother us
[43:33] and things that didn't
[43:34] lord settle with others lord maybe it
[43:36] settled with us and
[43:37] lord a long time we didn't know what it
[43:39] was but then one day we recognized it
[43:41] was a gene
[43:42] seed lord of your own life that you
[43:44] placed on the inside of us and lord by
[43:46] that seed you have drawn us together
[43:48] lord you
[43:49] you have drawn us from different paths
[43:51] of life and or drawn us under this great
[43:53] message that you've sent in this hour so
[43:55] this morning lord
[43:56] we're not here for ritual we're not here
[43:59] for tradition

[46:24] greetings to you and i do want to take
[46:26] this opportunity just to extend a thank
[46:28] you and appreciation to all those that
[46:30] was able to
[46:31] come last week brother tim and brother
[46:33] timothy and the different ones to the
[46:35] meetings there back home we sure sure
[46:37] appreciated everyone that was able to
[46:38] come
[46:39] and i tell you it's a it's a wonderful
[46:41] time to be a christian but it's a
[46:43] terrible time to be the devil amen
[46:45] there's a lot going on right now amen a
[46:47] lot of victories taking place
[46:49] revival burning across the land and for
[46:51] that we're grateful this morning amen
[46:53] amen in the book of deuteronomy the 29th
[46:56] chapter
[46:57] and the 29th verse i have a few places
[47:00] i'd like to read here this morning if
[47:01] that's okay
[47:02] deuteronomy the 29th chapter in the 29th
[47:06] verse the bible here says the secret
[47:09] things
[47:10] belong unto the lord our god but those
[47:13] things which are revealed
[47:15] belong unto us and to our children
[47:18] forever
[47:19] that we may do all the words of this law
[47:23] the secret things belong unto the lord
[47:26] our god but those things which are
[47:27] revealed
[47:28] belong unto us so at one time they're
[47:30] going to be secret things
[47:32] but then they're going to be revealed
[47:34] and they're going to belong unto us
[47:36] and to our children forever that we may
[47:39] do the words of this law now
[47:41] we ask this question how do we get the
[47:44] secret things if you turn the book of
[47:45] amos
[47:46] the third chapter amos the third chapter
[47:50] and the seventh verse a very very
[47:52] familiar reading to
[47:54] all the believers here this morning but
[47:56] god has got to have a way or a means by
[47:58] which he will reveal these secret things
[48:01] and in the seventh verse of the third
[48:03] chapter of amos
[48:05] the bible says now surely the lord god
[48:08] will do nothing
[48:09] but he revealeth his secret unto his
[48:12] servants
[48:13] the prophets amen surely the lord god
[48:16] will do nothing but he revealeth his
[48:18] secret
[48:19] unto his servants the prophets and one
[48:21] of the place i'd like to look this
[48:22] morning is hebrews the sixth chapter
[48:24] and i want to speak to you a little bit
[48:26] this morning about
[48:27] one of those secrets i believe the
[48:29] message of the hour is full of secrets
[48:31] this morning don't you
[48:32] but the beautiful thing about it is
[48:34] they've been revealed amen by a prophet
[48:37] in the book of hebrews the sixth chapter
[48:41] and the 18th verse we believe paul wrote
[48:45] the book of hebrews and paul says here
[48:47] in the 18th verse
[48:48] that by two immutable things in which it
[48:50] was impossible for god to lie
[48:53] we might have a strong consolation how
[48:55] many is thankful we have a strong
[48:56] consolation this morning
[48:58] we might have a strong consolation who
[49:01] have fled for refuge to lay hold
[49:03] upon the hope that is set before us
[49:06] which hope we have
[49:07] as an anchor of the soul both sure and
[49:10] steadfast
[49:12] and which entereth into that within the
[49:14] veil whether the forerunner is for us
[49:17] entered even jesus made a high priest
[49:21] forever after the order of melchizedek
[49:25] we asked the lord this morning to add
[49:27] the blessing to the reading of his word
[49:29] as you may have your seats
[49:30] uh this morning from those scriptures we
[49:32] find amen our
[49:34] assignment this one in the word and if i
[49:36] title this today i want to speak to you
[49:38] for a few moments on
[49:40] the secret of a victorious life the
[49:42] secret
[49:43] of a victorious life how many how many
[49:45] desires of victorious life this morning
[49:48] the prophet of god preaches a message in
[49:50] 1965 and he calls it christ
[49:53] is revealed in his own word he said now
[49:56] and my text this morning is christ
[49:58] is revealed in his own word now where i
[50:00] come to the conclusion to talk on this
[50:02] was because knowing that we we say we
[50:05] mustn't just say
[50:06] uh something because we're gathered
[50:08] together just to say something
[50:09] haphazardly to speak on anything but
[50:12] it's something that will help stabilize
[50:14] the people amen something
[50:16] that will help stabilize the people for
[50:18] we are going
[50:19] amen to pass through dangerous and
[50:21] treacherous waters now this is not a
[50:23] possibility it's not something we might
[50:25] do we might pass through dangerous
[50:27] waters we might pass through treacherous
[50:29] waters
[50:29] amen but the prophet of god is saying we
[50:32] are going
[50:32] every one of us amen is going to pass
[50:35] through dangerous waters
[50:37] amen through treacherous waters and he
[50:39] says and we're already sailing through
[50:41] them now
[50:42] he said and sometimes i guess with you
[50:44] like it is with me
[50:45] amen it seems like so much of it is it
[50:48] it's just such a scary thing now
[50:49] amen if a prophet of god could sail
[50:51] through dangerous and treacherous waters
[50:53] and openly tell
[50:54] us amen that selling through those
[50:56] things sometimes brings a fear upon you
[50:59] amen then i'll say it like this it's not
[51:01] uncommon today
[51:02] amen maybe to have a bit of a fear about
[51:05] the things that are before the church
[51:06] but
[51:06] amen a prophet would go on to say but we
[51:09] have been stabilized
[51:10] amen by the power of the word to face
[51:13] these things that we're going through
[51:14] amen now let me say this brother branham
[51:16] was not a defeated preacher he
[51:18] he was not a defeated prophet he was not
[51:20] a defeated individual
[51:22] amen but he was a victorious preacher he
[51:24] was a victorious prophet and it wasn't
[51:26] that he didn't have troubles
[51:28] and he didn't have struggles but what it
[51:30] was was he had an anchor now
[51:32] amen that word victorious means having
[51:34] won a victory
[51:35] he meant being triumphed of or
[51:37] characterized by victory it means to
[51:39] conquer
[51:40] it means to win it means to be the
[51:42] champion
[51:43] it means to be successful so amen to
[51:46] think about this this morning that god
[51:48] has sent a message in this
[51:50] hour amen that you don't have to be
[51:52] characterized by the things you're going
[51:54] through
[51:54] amen or the situations you're facing but
[51:56] you're actually being characterized
[51:58] amen by the victory of jesus christ we
[52:01] we all this morning desire
[52:03] he meant to be victorious amen is there
[52:05] anybody here this morning that doesn't
[52:07] desire to be victorious
[52:09] amen we all desire to be victorious now
[52:12] amen as christians we we have all seen
[52:14] people
[52:14] amen that we look up to as strong
[52:16] believers you you maybe see a preacher
[52:18] or you see somebody in the church
[52:20] and you look up to them and you think i
[52:22] wish i could be like that or
[52:24] i wish i could always have the victory
[52:26] like they have amen
[52:27] i thirst for something that they have
[52:29] the prophet said i find
[52:30] they've been that people struggle he
[52:32] said seems like i meet people
[52:34] and they say it's just such a struggle
[52:35] have you ever seen that wave
[52:37] he said probably there's many sitting
[52:39] here before me now that has ups and
[52:40] downs and ins and outs he said
[52:42] they meant they said the day they're all
[52:44] right you meet them and well
[52:45] they love the lord and tomorrow they're
[52:47] having such a struggle to hold on
[52:49] he says the devil is tempting them and
[52:51] they're having such ups and downs he
[52:53] said then you meet somebody
[52:55] that's on the hilltop all the time he
[52:58] said brother there's nothing bothers
[52:59] them at all now there's bound to be
[53:01] something they've been lacking somewhere
[53:03] because god
[53:05] is no respecter persons can can you
[53:07] agree with me there
[53:08] god is no respecter persons amen or god
[53:11] doesn't respect persons
[53:13] he wants all of his children to have the
[53:15] same hey
[53:16] amen he wants all of his children to
[53:18] have the same a righteous father
[53:20] wouldn't give one a dish of ice cream
[53:22] without giving them all ice cream
[53:24] certainly he wants you to live
[53:25] he said no i am not talking about gifts
[53:28] i'm talking about grace
[53:29] he meant some are called the apostles
[53:31] some are called the prophets some are
[53:33] called the teachers
[53:34] amen but god has placed in the church
[53:36] these things
[53:37] but what i'm talking about is measures
[53:39] of grace
[53:40] amen overcoming grace to each one he
[53:43] meant then to think this morning that
[53:45] it's not just a pastor
[53:47] that can be victorious it's not just the
[53:49] evangelist that can be victorious it's
[53:51] not just the apostle
[53:52] even that can be victorious but it is
[53:54] the housewife amen that can be
[53:56] victorious it is
[53:57] it is the young man that can be
[53:59] victorious it is the teenage girl
[54:01] amen that can be victorious it's not
[54:03] based upon the gift
[54:04] amen or the office that you hold that is
[54:06] producing the victory
[54:07] amen what is producing the victory is
[54:09] the grace amen that is on the inside of
[54:12] the believer
[54:13] amen i'll say it like this it's it's not
[54:15] a natural
[54:16] ain't meant to have a thirst to live a
[54:18] victorious life the prophet said it's
[54:20] not a natural thing to thirst for god
[54:22] it is a natural thing it's just
[54:24] something that you should do
[54:26] god has made you up like that and it's
[54:28] no
[54:29] superhuman amen amen let's say that
[54:31] together it's no
[54:32] superhuman it's no superhuman it's just
[54:36] actually a common human being amen
[54:39] amen it ain't something special for some
[54:41] people they say well i've seen some
[54:43] people live such a victorious life
[54:45] that they're constantly on the housetop
[54:47] and they're praising god
[54:48] i wish i could feel that way he meant
[54:51] well the reason you are feeling that way
[54:53] is it's a first in you and it's for
[54:55] every person to thirst for god
[54:57] amen not now now what what a miserable
[54:59] people we would be here this morning
[55:01] he meant to have a thirst for that but
[55:03] there not be a way to obtain it
[55:05] he meant to have a desire for that but
[55:07] there not be a way to grasp it but this
[55:09] morning church
[55:10] amen every individual under the sound of
[55:12] my voice
[55:13] amen has got a right in authority this
[55:15] morning
[55:16] he meant by the holy ghost not to sit
[55:18] there amen and wish you could have
[55:20] victory
[55:21] amen wish you could have joy wish you
[55:23] could have peace
[55:24] amen wish you could have overcoming
[55:26] grace amen there is a message in the
[55:28] hour
[55:29] amen there's a message in the land today
[55:31] that says you don't have to wish for it
[55:33] you can get up
[55:34] and go get it amen if you want a victory
[55:36] amen you ain't got to wish you could get
[55:38] it it's already yours
[55:39] amen the only thing you've got to do is
[55:41] claim it amen i'll tell you this morning
[55:43] i am sick and tired
[55:44] he meant of the devil robbing the church
[55:47] of the living god from the things that
[55:49] god died that they could have
[55:50] amen christ died that we could have
[55:52] victory and then he died that we could
[55:54] have joy
[55:55] he died that we could have healing and
[55:57] salvation amen and that devil's put
[55:59] these things off in the future somewhere
[56:01] but there's not an army coming there's
[56:03] not a generation coming
[56:05] there is a generation here this morning
[56:07] that says these things are not for the
[56:09] future
[56:09] these things are for right now amen if
[56:12] the pastor could have victory
[56:13] amen then their housewife could have
[56:15] victory he meant if the evangelist can
[56:17] have victory
[56:18] then the young girl can have victory
[56:20] there is no age limits
[56:22] he meant on the victory of almighty god
[56:25] it is for whoever
[56:26] amen wants to raise up and claim it you
[56:28] can have it this morning
[56:30] amen it's a thirst it's a desire amen
[56:33] it's a hunger to live
[56:34] a victorious life actually what you're
[56:36] doing is you're thirsting for the god
[56:39] amen that manifested himself in the
[56:41] individual
[56:42] that made them an overcomer in their
[56:44] situation think about that you're not
[56:46] thirsting amen to be like brother tim or
[56:48] in these preachers
[56:50] amen you're thirsting amen for the god
[56:52] that's on the inside of them
[56:54] when you see them face things and
[56:56] something raises up in them
[56:58] and doesn't pull back and retreat but
[57:00] says let's move forward
[57:02] amen see that's the god in them causing
[57:04] them to do that
[57:05] revelation the third chapter him that
[57:07] overcometh will i make a pillar
[57:09] in the temple of my god and he shall go
[57:11] no more out and i will write upon him
[57:13] the name of my god
[57:15] and the name of the city of my god which
[57:17] is the new jerusalem
[57:19] which cometh down out of heaven from my
[57:21] god and i will ride upon him
[57:24] amen my new name now who's doing this
[57:27] it's not the individual
[57:29] amen it's the holy ghost on the inside
[57:31] of the individual manifesting the
[57:33] characteristic of god can you say amen
[57:37] he said now he's not only given crowns
[57:39] but he says these and the bride
[57:41] will be made pillars in the temple of
[57:43] god but what is the temple of god
[57:45] amen jesus spoke of his body as being
[57:48] the temple it was
[57:50] it was the temple of god but now we are
[57:52] his body
[57:53] amen the true church is the temple of
[57:56] god by
[57:57] the holy ghost within us he meant the
[57:59] true church
[58:00] is the temple of god he'd been by the
[58:03] holy ghost within us
[58:04] now he is going to make the overcomer he
[58:07] meant a
[58:08] pillar in the temple he meant but what
[58:10] is a pillar a pillar
[58:11] is actually a part of the foundation for
[58:14] it holds up the superstructure
[58:16] he said praise god amen that puts the
[58:19] overcomer
[58:20] amen right in there with the apostles
[58:22] and the prophets
[58:24] oh help me lord amen that puts the
[58:26] overcomer
[58:28] amen right in the superstructure amen on
[58:31] the same foundation
[58:32] amen that the apostles and the prophets
[58:35] won't think about
[58:36] that this morning amen it's not just the
[58:38] prophet
[58:39] amen in the foundation it's not just the
[58:41] apostle
[58:42] in the foundation it's not just the
[58:44] pastor amen but it's the overcomer
[58:46] amen that's on the same foundation
[58:49] to think this morning that's the reason
[58:51] the devil is fighting you like he is
[58:53] amen because you're not a quitter amen
[58:55] you're an overcomer
[58:56] amen you're not a throw up your hands
[58:58] and turn around
[59:00] you are an overcomer and has been called
[59:02] by the grace of almighty god
[59:04] to be a part of the superstructure in
[59:06] the last days
[59:07] amen paul will say you are no more
[59:09] strangers and foreigners amen but you
[59:11] are fellow citizens with the saints
[59:13] and of the household of god and are
[59:16] built upon the foundation
[59:18] amen of the apostles and the prophets
[59:20] jesus christ himself
[59:22] amen be in the chief cornerstone in whom
[59:25] the whole body
[59:26] fitly framed together amen groweth unto
[59:29] a holy temple in the lord
[59:30] in whom he also are building together
[59:33] for inhabitation of god through the
[59:35] spirit
[59:36] amen so in this age we're living in god
[59:38] it's not building the denomination
[59:40] god is building a church are you with me
[59:44] the problem of god said god is building
[59:45] a church
[59:46] he is building superstructure
[59:48] powerhouses
[59:49] he meant to be witnesses in this last
[59:51] day he said in verse 22
[59:54] we are building together with him
[59:55] everything went through the door jesus
[59:58] and it's a part of the body or the
[59:59] temple
[1:00:00] now when god puts a man in the temple as
[1:00:02] a pillar
[1:00:03] and makes him a part of the foundation
[1:00:05] group what is he doing
[1:00:07] he is giving him the revelation of the
[1:00:09] word
[1:00:10] and of himself because that is exactly
[1:00:13] amen what the apostles and the prophets
[1:00:15] had
[1:00:15] amen can i just take a time out and
[1:00:17] preach to here for a second amen
[1:00:19] sometimes you get your mind
[1:00:20] amen that the preachers got more than

[1:00:40] mentor come into the heart of the
[1:00:41] believer
[1:00:42] he meant to quicken an overcomer on the
[1:00:45] inside of them
[1:00:46] that no matter what they go through
[1:00:48] they'll still be standing
[1:00:50] amen can i get a witness here today that
[1:00:52] says i know what you're talking about
[1:00:54] amen it wasn't because of the family i
[1:00:56] come out of it wasn't because of the
[1:00:58] church i was raised in
[1:01:00] it wasn't because of the home it was
[1:01:02] because the grace
[1:01:03] the overcoming grace of god had been
[1:01:06] brought down in my soul
[1:01:07] they met and quickened the seed on the
[1:01:09] inside of me
[1:01:10] that's why i'm standing here today oh
[1:01:12] come on church
[1:01:13] i'm not talking about a bunch of
[1:01:15] wishy-washy cowards and a bunch of
[1:01:17] hybrid christians
[1:01:18] they've been to blow up and throw up
[1:01:20] amen at the first sign of trouble
[1:01:21] i'm talking about some rugged aiming
[1:01:24] warriors i'm talking about some sons and
[1:01:26] daughters of god
[1:01:27] that when the devil amen throws
[1:01:29] everything he's got action
[1:01:30] you stand there and spray your shoulders
[1:01:32] back and say is that all you got
[1:01:34] amen i'm not a part of this layout of
[1:01:37] sea and lukewarm
[1:01:38] hybrid religion i am a part of the
[1:01:40] foundation
[1:01:41] it is a super structure it is a
[1:01:44] word-built church
[1:01:45] it is a church that don't blow apart
[1:01:47] it's a church that stands
[1:01:49] in the face of adversaries it stands in
[1:01:52] the face of sickness
[1:01:53] it stands in the face of heartache we
[1:01:56] have got the same thing paul had
[1:01:58] we got the same thing the apostles had
[1:02:03] you're not made out of one material and
[1:02:06] the prophets they have another in the
[1:02:07] upon oh
[1:02:08] amen it's the same material
[1:02:12] it's holy ghost material
[1:02:15] amen isn't that good it's holy ghost
[1:02:18] material
[1:02:18] amen then you know what kind of material
[1:02:20] you're made out of you're made out of
[1:02:22] stuff that don't bluff
[1:02:24] ain't that good you're made out of stuff
[1:02:27] that don't
[1:02:27] so the first sign of trouble doesn't
[1:02:29] cause you to back up
[1:02:31] it causes you to do the same thing that
[1:02:33] the forerunners before you done
[1:02:36] because you're built out of the same
[1:02:38] material he said what is it it is the
[1:02:40] word
[1:02:40] and no one somebody say no one no one
[1:02:44] can get the word out of them amen no one
[1:02:47] can get it out of him

[1:08:46] amen case you don't know i sweat amen
[1:08:48] and every now and again you get to
[1:08:49] preach it and sweat starts running down
[1:08:51] on the page

[1:09:21] living epistles
[1:09:23] that have not been read by ink amen that
[1:09:25] when they go through something
[1:09:26] the tears can wash away what god has
[1:09:29] done in their life
[1:09:30] when they go through the fire amen the
[1:09:32] fire can burn away
[1:09:33] what god has done in their life i'm
[1:09:35] talking about some christians
[1:09:36] amen that have been written by the
[1:09:38] spirit of god and my bible says heaven
[1:09:41] and earth shall pass away
[1:09:42] but my word shall never pass away it's
[1:09:45] not been written
[1:09:46] in the tables of stone but in the
[1:09:49] fleshly
[1:09:49] tables of the heart see the promise of
[1:09:52] the jewish church
[1:09:53] was brought out of egypt in palestine
[1:09:55] was the natural church
[1:09:57] he said that a natural law was a natural
[1:09:59] people
[1:10:00] but we today are god's spiritual church
[1:10:03] with a spiritual law written on the
[1:10:06] tables of our heart
[1:10:07] and we are oh god we are being led in a
[1:10:10] spiritual form
[1:10:12] we are not here as a natural church with
[1:10:15] a natural law
[1:10:16] being led in a natural form we are here
[1:10:19] as the spiritual church with a spiritual
[1:10:22] law
[1:10:23] and then written in our hearts being led
[1:10:25] in a spiritual form

[1:10:28] pillar of fire was
[1:10:30] the angel lord but we don't look today
[1:10:32] now think about this
[1:10:34] israel looked to see where is the pillar
[1:10:37] of fire
[1:10:38] he said they looked there and they
[1:10:39] looked here he said but we
[1:10:41] don't look today because there's just
[1:10:44] something
[1:10:44] happens that we know he's there okay
[1:10:47] amen there's just something happens that
[1:10:50] we know
[1:10:51] he's there what could happen amen that
[1:10:53] would cause us to know
[1:10:55] that no matter what we're going through
[1:10:57] amen our leader is still with us
[1:10:59] no matter what we're facing amen our god
[1:11:02] is still with us
[1:11:03] no matter what doctor's report we
[1:11:04] receive the great physician

[1:11:08] we face in the middle of the night
[1:11:10] brother tim we know that god is still
[1:11:12] with us
[1:11:13] what could happen that would cause us to
[1:11:15] know that i'll tell you what it is
[1:11:17] it's an experience on the backside of
[1:11:19] the desert
[1:11:21] it's you standing the same place moses
[1:11:24] stood talking that leader
[1:11:25] face to face there's something happens
[1:11:28] that we
[1:11:28] know he's there are you with me
[1:11:31] we know he's there amen when you receive
[1:11:34] a bad doctor's report you don't have to
[1:11:35] walk out of the doctor's office
[1:11:37] and say oh god where is you hey where
[1:11:39] were you at you just walk out there and
[1:11:40] say
[1:11:41] he said he'd never leave me he said he
[1:11:43] never forsake me
[1:11:44] he said he would be with me always even
[1:11:46] until the end
[1:11:48] are you hearing me amen i'm not here
[1:11:50] this morning ain't been guessing the
[1:11:52] pillar of fire is here
[1:11:53] i didn't come here hoping the pillar of
[1:11:55] fire would show up
[1:11:56] brother hell i didn't come here hoping
[1:11:58] that the same pillar fire
[1:12:00] that led israel would come in this
[1:12:02] building this morning i come here
[1:12:04] knowing
[1:12:04] he was going to be here oh help me
[1:12:08] church
[1:12:08] we're not a bunch of guesters this
[1:12:10] morning we are believers
[1:12:12] amen that knows beyond the shadow of a
[1:12:13] doubt that the pillar of power
[1:12:15] is with us this morning are you with me
[1:12:19] amen we know he's here therefore we know
[1:12:21] amen that sometimes
[1:12:23] we've got to sacrifice things in our
[1:12:25] life to surrender ourselves
[1:12:27] to the leadership of the holy ghost how
[1:12:29] many believes you're a part of that
[1:12:30] spiritual church
[1:12:32] how many believers you're a part of that
[1:12:34] spiritual lead church amen spiritual
[1:12:36] land farm church
[1:12:37] the prophet said many times spiritual ed
[1:12:40] people are misunderstood
[1:12:42] amen to the peoples of the world because
[1:12:44] it's such a strange
[1:12:45] amen an odd life to live a full
[1:12:48] surrendered life to the lord jesus
[1:12:51] amen it's a strange and an odd life
[1:12:54] to live a full surrender life to the
[1:12:57] lord jesus
[1:12:58] amen now think about that remember the
[1:13:00] prophet talked about the man there and
[1:13:02] his baby dying with black diphtheria
[1:13:04] and he said he was standing there and he
[1:13:05] was talking to nurses talking the
[1:13:07] doctors
[1:13:08] and he said then the prophet come in and
[1:13:09] he began to pray and he said this saith
[1:13:11] lord the child will be well
[1:13:13] amen now think about this they had scans
[1:13:15] they had reports
[1:13:16] they had everything they're testifying
[1:13:18] the baby was going to die
[1:13:20] but a father amen was able to stand
[1:13:22] there and say praise god he's going to
[1:13:25] live
[1:13:25] amen praise god it's going to be fine
[1:13:27] and the nurses said
[1:13:29] sir you've lost your mind no he hadn't
[1:13:32] he was a part of a spiritual lead church
[1:13:34] that was not being led by the natural he
[1:13:37] was being led by the spiritual
[1:13:39] which was the supernatural oh i'm
[1:13:42] trying to behave myself amen you know
[1:13:44] why they looked at him and said sir
[1:13:45] you've lost your mind
[1:13:46] it's because he could look at their
[1:13:48] reports and laugh
[1:13:50] in the face of those reports because he
[1:13:52] heard
[1:13:53] what god said amen are you hearing me
[1:13:55] this morning you know why this church
[1:13:57] amen is ridiculed and made fun of it's
[1:14:00] not because of where you're at
[1:14:01] it's not because of who you are it's
[1:14:03] because you broke out
[1:14:05] of this earthbound realm into a heavily
[1:14:07] bound realm
[1:14:08] into an atmosphere where all things are
[1:14:11] possible
[1:14:12] and no matter what the devil throws at
[1:14:14] you it don't have the power to shake you
[1:14:18] oh the devil had his way this morning we
[1:14:21] and everyone be out of this church
[1:14:23] but he didn't have his way because we
[1:14:25] then broke into another realm
[1:14:27] and we know no matter what tomorrow
[1:14:29] holds we've done fellowship
[1:14:32] with the one who is holding tomorrow
[1:14:35] if it's a storm it'll be okay if it's a
[1:14:38] sickness
[1:14:38] we'll be okay are you hearing me not
[1:14:41] talking about up and down
[1:14:42] i'm talking about coming to a place of
[1:14:44] stability
[1:14:45] amen by the revelation of the word see
[1:14:48] then what you got to do is surrender
[1:14:50] yourself
[1:14:51] to the leadership of the pillar of fire
[1:14:53] you can't tell the pillar of fire where
[1:14:54] to take you
[1:14:55] you've got to surrender yourself and say
[1:14:58] pillar of fire
[1:14:59] wherever you take me i'm not your leader
[1:15:01] you're mine
[1:15:02] i'm not your amen you're not my follower
[1:15:05] i'm your follower
[1:15:08] well is this okay amen pillar of fire if

[1:15:56] the bride's body amen now how many will
[1:15:58] accept this call
[1:15:59] how many will accept that challenge amen
[1:16:02] let me say it like this
[1:16:03] amen he wasn't challenging you just to
[1:16:05] believe
[1:16:06] that on the platform the son of man was
[1:16:08] being revealed
[1:16:09] even when he was speaking the storms the
[1:16:11] son of man was being
[1:16:12] he was challenging you to believe in
[1:16:14] this son of man dispensation
[1:16:16] that no matter what you go through the
[1:16:19] same son of man
[1:16:20] that was there is here leading the
[1:16:23] church
[1:16:25] through the bride's body amen like this
[1:16:28] the prophet said i believe it like this
[1:16:30] the son of man in human flesh through
[1:16:33] the bride's body
[1:16:34] see that what he's doing in this hour is
[1:16:36] paul is not here
[1:16:37] peter is not here james is not here can
[1:16:40] i say it like this william branham is
[1:16:42] not here
[1:16:43] amen but joe is here and tim is here
[1:16:46] and timothy and aaron is here are you
[1:16:48] with me
[1:16:49] and young men is here amen so will you
[1:16:51] accept
[1:16:52] amen that the same son of man that
[1:16:55] revealed himself
[1:16:56] through that part of the body is the
[1:16:58] same son of man
[1:17:00] revealing himself through this part of
[1:17:01] the body in the hour
[1:17:03] living in now i'll say it like this i
[1:17:06] believe it's possible to get the victory
[1:17:08] amen about shouting my my shoe heels off
[1:17:11] back there
[1:17:11] when brother tim was singing that song i
[1:17:13] believe it is possible to get to victory
[1:17:16] but can i tell you something else i
[1:17:17] believe
[1:17:18] i believe it's possible to keep the
[1:17:19] victory
[1:17:22] i don't believe it's just possible to
[1:17:23] get it even i believe it's possible to
[1:17:25] keep it
[1:17:26] i believe it's possible amen to live
[1:17:29] a victorious life in the middle of a
[1:17:32] neurotic age
[1:17:34] i believe it's possible amen to live in
[1:17:37] an
[1:17:37] atmosphere with god when men are one
[1:17:39] degree
[1:17:40] from total insanity i believe there is a
[1:17:43] stable bride
[1:17:45] all right let's get cut loose and preach
[1:17:47] in a minute i believe there is a stable
[1:17:50] bride
[1:17:50] up on the earth today that is not being
[1:17:53] led by what she sees
[1:17:54] she's not being pulled amen by the child
[1:17:57] she goes
[1:17:58] through amen but she's called a glimpse
[1:18:00] of the other side
[1:18:01] and there's an anchor over there that is
[1:18:04] anchored in her heart
[1:18:05] and it is pulling her through everything
[1:18:07] she's going through
[1:18:08] amen it is possible somebody say it's
[1:18:10] possible
[1:18:12] to get the victory say it like you
[1:18:14] believe it it is possible
[1:18:16] to get the victory it is possible
[1:18:19] to keep the victory it is possible to
[1:18:22] keep the victory
[1:18:23] because the thirst or the desire of the
[1:18:26] believer is to live a victorious life
[1:18:29] amen i i i'll say it like this the
[1:18:31] prophet said the lord knows the faults
[1:18:33] and the intents of your heart now can i
[1:18:36] take a minute here and read something to

[1:18:43] any two-edged sword
[1:18:45] it is piercing even to the dividing
[1:18:47] asunder of the soul
[1:18:48] and spirit of the joint to the morrow
[1:18:51] and it is a discerner
[1:18:53] of the faults and the intent of the
[1:18:55] heart

[1:18:58] a desire in your heart

[1:22:46] opportunity that paul had to overcome
[1:22:48] the devil
[1:22:50] matter of fact the prophet said you got
[1:22:52] more opportunities
[1:22:54] that's easter 65 in case you want to
[1:22:56] know you've got more opportunities to
[1:22:58] overcome
[1:22:59] in this age of any age before us see

[1:23:09] the promised sign
[1:23:11] of the messiah which said it shall be
[1:23:14] when the son of man is revealed now
[1:23:16] notice this when light shall come
[1:23:18] amen light shall cover amen and reveal
[1:23:21] what is laying there
[1:23:24] now i just wonder sometimes when that
[1:23:26] woman stood in the prayer line
[1:23:27] and she had that inflamed bladder and
[1:23:29] the other woman come with the heart
[1:23:30] trouble
[1:23:31] did they realize that that same light
[1:23:34] that could uncover
[1:23:35] the huge need in their life could
[1:23:37] uncover that other need
[1:23:38] of desiring to live a victorious life
[1:23:42] but in the presence of the evening light
[1:23:45] amen there is nothing hit
[1:23:46] oh god zechariah prophesied it
[1:23:49] shall be light see it shall be light
[1:23:52] about the middle day
[1:23:53] no at the evening time then what is
[1:23:56] light set for
[1:23:57] so you can see how to get around
[1:24:01] amen see where you're at it shall be
[1:24:03] light
[1:24:04] at the evening time brother said so we
[1:24:07] see
[1:24:07] the evening lights amen are here think
[1:24:10] about that church
[1:24:11] the evening lights are not coming but
[1:24:13] the evening lights are here and what
[1:24:14] does it have to do light
[1:24:16] if you have eyes to see how to get
[1:24:17] around what is the evening light
[1:24:19] it's the light that comes on to reveal
[1:24:21] something see what is malachi
[1:24:23] 4 to do to do the same thing what was
[1:24:26] the open of the seven seals to do
[1:24:28] where all these denominations stand
[1:24:29] around this is to reveal
[1:24:31] and to bring out if you haven't got any
[1:24:34] eyes
[1:24:34] then what's the what's the use to reveal
[1:24:37] now think about that
[1:24:38] god did not reveal the secret things and
[1:24:41] the hidden things
[1:24:42] even without there being some eyes on
[1:24:44] the earth to see what he was revealing
[1:24:47] oh god have mercy he didn't reveal the
[1:24:50] seven mysteries of the bible
[1:24:51] hoping somebody would see it he didn't
[1:24:53] reveal the baptism
[1:24:55] of the holy ghost pope and somebody
[1:24:56] would see he didn't reveal
[1:24:58] how to overcome amen hoping somebody
[1:25:01] would see it
[1:25:01] but he revealed it and then knowing that
[1:25:04] when the light began to shine
[1:25:05] there would be some eyes up on the earth
[1:25:08] that would be able to see what god was
[1:25:10] revealing
[1:25:12] old church this morning how many's got
[1:25:14] eyes to see
[1:25:15] anybody got eyes to see you ought to be
[1:25:18] the happiest person
[1:25:19] in this building today when god has
[1:25:21] hidden hidden things in his word
[1:25:23] amen for seven ages but has released
[1:25:25] them in this age
[1:25:26] that we wouldn't be here stumbling
[1:25:28] around trying to find out how to live
[1:25:30] right
[1:25:30] trying to find out how to baptize trying
[1:25:32] to figure out how to have church
[1:25:34] we have been given the secret things
[1:25:37] they've been revealed through the
[1:25:38] channel of a prophet
[1:25:40] oh the faith this morning church we've
[1:25:42] got eyes to see
[1:25:44] therefore god has sent the revelation
[1:25:46] that we can see by
[1:25:48] what was the manifestation of the sign
[1:25:50] the son of man
[1:25:51] it was a victory in this age amen over
[1:25:53] the demon of unbelief
[1:25:56] can i preach here for a minute it was a
[1:25:58] victory in this age
[1:26:00] over the demon of unbelief
[1:26:04] when the prophet god be standing there
[1:26:05] and he would say you've got this trouble
[1:26:07] and you've got that trouble
[1:26:08] and you've got that trouble what would
[1:26:09] he say do you believe me
[1:26:11] do you believe do you now believe
[1:26:16] what would he say if i told you your
[1:26:18] name would you believe
[1:26:20] if i told you your address would you
[1:26:22] believe and then stand there
[1:26:24] and accurately call out things that was
[1:26:27] buried
[1:26:27] in the hearts of individuals to show
[1:26:30] them in this age
[1:26:31] there is nothing hidden from the lord
[1:26:35] are you with me this morning amen the
[1:26:37] prophet said you want to know what i'm
[1:26:38] talking about is
[1:26:39] you might have thought i had something
[1:26:40] to do with this he said because i'm
[1:26:42] packing the message
[1:26:43] i have no more to do with it than
[1:26:45] nothing i'm no more than just a voice
[1:26:48] he said see it isn't me it wasn't the
[1:26:51] seventh angel
[1:26:52] it was the manifestation of the son of
[1:26:55] man
[1:26:55] it wasn't the angel his message it was
[1:26:58] the mystery that god unfolded
[1:27:00] it's not a man it's god so now we've
[1:27:04] found the secret
[1:27:05] amen to a victorious life is it's not
[1:27:08] the man
[1:27:09] it's the god it's not the preacher
[1:27:12] it's the god he said see the angel was
[1:27:15] not the son of man
[1:27:16] he was the messenger but the son of man
[1:27:18] is christ
[1:27:20] he is the one you're feeding on you're
[1:27:22] not feeding on a man
[1:27:24] his words will fail but you are feeding
[1:27:27] on the unfailing body word oh help me
[1:27:30] church
[1:27:31] you are feeding on the unfailing body
[1:27:34] word
[1:27:35] of the son of man now let me say like
[1:27:37] this man
[1:27:38] does not have the ability to manifest
[1:27:41] the desires of your heart
[1:27:42] amen but god has the ability to give you
[1:27:45] the desires of your heart
[1:27:46] so quit feeding on a man
[1:27:50] well i may get quiet here but that's
[1:27:52] quite all right we'll get through it
[1:27:53] even don't feel the personality of a man
[1:27:56] don't feel an idea of a man amen feed on
[1:28:00] christ
[1:28:00] which is the unfailing body word of the
[1:28:04] son of man
[1:28:04] amen how many can agree the message of
[1:28:06] the hour came and not to produce halfway
[1:28:09] christians
[1:28:09] but to produce total christians even you
[1:28:12] realize the prophet said moses
[1:28:14] could not bring a total leverage to
[1:28:15] israel until he was totally delivered
[1:28:18] himself
[1:28:20] moses had to be totally livered moses
[1:28:22] had to come into a place
[1:28:23] of consecration with god before he could
[1:28:26] lead others
[1:28:26] he said what a marvelous victorious life
[1:28:28] halfway life is the most miserable thing
[1:28:30] there is
[1:28:31] and by the way there's no such a thing
[1:28:34] as a halfway christian
[1:28:35] you're either a sinner or a saint you're
[1:28:38] on one side of the fence or the other
[1:28:40] if you're born again you're saved if
[1:28:42] you're not born again you're outside of
[1:28:44] christ
[1:28:44] without hope without god but god has
[1:28:47] made preparation for you to be saved
[1:28:50] amen let me say this if you're riding
[1:28:52] the fence this morning
[1:28:54] there is a way that has been made for
[1:28:56] you to take a stand
[1:28:58] on the other side of the fence
[1:29:00] [Applause]
[1:29:02] god has made preparation for you to step
[1:29:06] across
[1:29:06] on the other side of the side of victory
[1:29:09] let me just stop here and say
[1:29:10] victory is not a future tense promise
[1:29:13] and it is not a past tense promise
[1:29:15] amen but victory is a present tense
[1:29:18] promise well brother andrew we'll have
[1:29:21] victory in the millennium
[1:29:22] and we victoria brother branham was here
[1:29:24] i say brother joel

[1:29:36] got victory see

[1:29:40] is here this morning
[1:29:44] oh some people think well i finally get
[1:29:46] the victory when i die
[1:29:47] but we are called to have victory in
[1:29:49] this life amen by the baptism
[1:29:52] of the holy ghost see god has made a
[1:29:55] preparation
[1:29:56] amen through the message of the hour to
[1:29:58] bring a stability
[1:30:00] to the heart of individuals that they
[1:30:02] can live a victorious life
[1:30:03] look what paul said in first corinthians
[1:30:05] 15 54
[1:30:06] so in this corruptable shall i put on
[1:30:08] incorruption and this mortal shall put
[1:30:10] on immortality
[1:30:11] then shall be brought to pass the sand
[1:30:13] that is written amen death
[1:30:15] is swallowed up in victory o death where
[1:30:18] is not sting
[1:30:19] grave amen the sting of death is sin

[1:44:05] my notes
[1:44:06] and then they call bethlehem they've

[1:45:12] it's a bunch of losers it's a bunch of
[1:45:14] people that never amount to nothing amen
[1:45:16] but god through prophecy
[1:45:18] [Applause]

[1:46:08] in the time of the placing of joshua of
[1:46:10] the place of the providences
[1:46:12] they didn't even call it but when god
[1:46:15] done something in bethlehem
[1:46:16] everybody flocked to it
[1:46:20] testing one two testing testing when it
[1:46:26] was not known by anybody else

[1:51:46] are people so tossed about he said
[1:51:49] they're tossed about
[1:51:50] because there's two phases of the same
[1:51:52] christianity
[1:51:53] he said one is an intellectual
[1:51:55] conception
[1:51:56] he said but two i love this brother tim

[1:51:59] it's an experimental experience
[1:52:01] [Applause]
[1:52:03] go ahead and give me some room to dance
[1:52:05] you know why

[1:52:08] old preacher that's got an intellectual
[1:52:10] conception
[1:52:10] you're looking at a 25 year old preacher
[1:52:12] that's got an experimental experience
[1:52:16] i didn't meet god through an
[1:52:18] intellectual conception
[1:52:19] i met god through an experience
[1:52:23] anybody else met him that way anybody
[1:52:26] else met him that way
[1:52:30] that what is that experience it's my
[1:52:31] anchor
[1:52:35] it's my anchor within the veil
[1:52:39] oh god help me jesus i've stepped out of
[1:52:43] the outer
[1:52:44] court i've stepped out of the inner
[1:52:47] court
[1:52:48] i'm in the inner veil now
[1:52:51] what did paul say brethren we now have
[1:52:53] boldness
[1:52:55] boldness to enter in
[1:52:59] to the holiest of holies by what
[1:53:02] by the blood of jesus christ
[1:53:07] now think about something if the bible's
[1:53:09] full of examples
[1:53:10] let's look at one here
[1:53:13] his name is paul
[1:53:17] hebrew says the earth or paul says this
[1:53:19] corinthians i want i want you to i want
[1:53:21] you to hear this
[1:53:23] because i still feel that old devil
[1:53:25] bouncing i'm not talking about a person
[1:53:27] i'm talking about spirit
[1:53:28] bouncing back and saying but brother
[1:53:30] andrew

[1:53:39] in a place with god and all the time
[1:53:41] have the victory
[1:53:45] but the bible told me i could and here's
[1:53:48] what my bible says about one of our
[1:53:50] examples
[1:53:51] are they hebrews so am i are they
[1:53:53] israelites so am i
[1:53:54] are they the seed of abraham so am i are
[1:53:56] they ministers of christ
[1:53:58] i speak as a fool i am more in labors
[1:54:01] more abundant and
[1:54:02] now if you can give me this it's second
[1:54:03] corinthians 11 23.
[1:54:06] i want you to read this for yourself
[1:54:09] because there's some will still say
[1:54:11] but andrew i'm going through too much to
[1:54:12] really praise god
[1:54:14] i'm going through too much truly to
[1:54:16] really worship god i wish i could be
[1:54:17] like them other people
[1:54:18] but i'm going to tell you about a man
[1:54:19] that that went through a lot
[1:54:22] but he still come out with a victory are
[1:54:25] they ministers of christ i speak as a
[1:54:27] fool

[1:55:00] in perils in the city in perils in the
[1:55:02] wilderness in perils in the sea
[1:55:05] in perils among false brethren in
[1:55:07] weariness and painfulness
[1:55:09] in watchings often in hunger and thirst
[1:55:12] in fastings often in cold and nakedness
[1:55:25] now is it over is it done here no and
[1:55:28] besides those things
[1:55:30] that are without that which cometh up on

[2:10:55] what i'm doing i'm preaching to some
[2:10:57] saints this morning
[2:10:59] you've been through troubles but you
[2:11:00] went through your troubles like a saint
[2:11:02] you've been through some trouble some
[2:11:04] heartaches but you handled it like a
[2:11:06] saint
[2:11:07] you've been through some let downs but
[2:11:08] you handled it like a saint
[2:11:12] as the musicians come this morning
[2:11:20] match your experience with paul's in the
[2:11:23] bible
[2:11:28] come to the place where you can sit down
[2:11:31] and list everything you've been through
[2:11:35] and say who is weak
[2:11:41] this flesh it gets weak
[2:11:45] but there's a god that's come down
[2:11:48] and claimed this body
[2:11:53] to get victory through
[2:11:58] how many can say this morning i want to
[2:12:01] go all the way in
[2:12:05] you remember the prophet god talked
[2:12:06] about abraham and lot he said lot said
[2:12:09] it
[2:12:09] i believe he says the gate he said he
[2:12:10] said at the gate he said because he said
[2:12:12] at the gate
[2:12:13] he said he could still be close enough
[2:12:16] he could hear what was going on outside
[2:12:18] and he could still hear abraham inside
[2:12:22] he said but abraham didn't stop at the
[2:12:24] gate he went all the way to the door
[2:12:27] he went in the door he said he got as
[2:12:29] close as he could
[2:12:33] think about this he didn't want to stay
[2:12:36] as far away as he could and still be
[2:12:37] okay
[2:12:39] he wanted to get as close in as he could
[2:12:42] here's the secret to all these people
[2:12:46] hey have you ever seen somebody shouting
[2:12:49] and you knew what they were going
[2:12:50] through you knew in your heart
[2:12:52] everything they're facing and you you
[2:12:55] knew they had every right to be sitting
[2:12:56] there
[2:12:59] but they were they was on their feet
[2:13:00] praising god
[2:13:02] they were they were glorifying the lord
[2:13:04] and had every right to be sitting there
[2:13:07] having a pity party but you know what
[2:13:10] happened that individual
[2:13:11] they went into the whole list of holies
[2:13:14] they went into a consecrated life
[2:13:17] it's i didn't have time to get through
[2:13:19] all of it but it's a beautiful study if
[2:13:20] you ever listen to why people are so
[2:13:21] tossed about
[2:13:22] the prophet shows the three different
[2:13:24] types of light he said the outside light
[2:13:26] he said was the natural sunlight
[2:13:28] he said so one day the sun could be
[2:13:30] shine and they have light the next day
[2:13:31] it could be cloudy and they didn't have
[2:13:32] no light
[2:13:33] he said then they went in that second
[2:13:34] cord he said it was the artificial
[2:13:36] candlelight so they went through the
[2:13:37] light of the candles
[2:13:38] he said one day the candles could be
[2:13:40] burning light go down have to re-light
[2:13:41] them
[2:13:42] he said but if they ever went in that
[2:13:43] shekinah glory
[2:13:45] in that holiest of holies he said in
[2:13:48] there
[2:13:49] the shekinah glory was always shining
[2:13:55] in there it was soundproof
[2:14:00] and there was hidden manna
[2:14:03] you ever you ever seen it's gonna be
[2:14:05] funny you ever seen a bodybuilder and
[2:14:06] you wonder what in the world is their
[2:14:10] secret are they eating what are they
[2:14:12] doing they're on a special diet
[2:14:15] you know what this bride's own she's on
[2:14:17] a special diet
[2:14:19] it's called the hidden manner and it's
[2:14:22] producing
[2:14:23] a victorious life
[2:14:27] well the andrew paul's experience is
[2:14:29] good but i don't think i can have it
[2:14:30] well the prophet of god said you could
[2:14:31] i brother andrew paul's faith is good
[2:14:33] but i don't i don't i don't just i just
[2:14:35] don't think that's a faith we can have
[2:14:37] i can't tell you paul's faith is the
[2:14:38] same faith we have
[2:14:40] fear none of those things which shall
[2:14:42] suffer behold the devil shall cast some
[2:14:43] of you into prison
[2:14:44] that you may be tried and you shall have
[2:14:46] tribulation ten days be thou faithful
[2:14:48] unto death and i will give thee a crown
[2:14:50] of life
[2:14:52] be thou faithful unto death he does not
[2:14:54] say be faithful unto death but unto
[2:14:56] death
[2:14:57] you may have to seal your testimony with
[2:14:59] your blood
[2:15:00] thousands yeah millions have died during
[2:15:03] all the ages they have died in the faith
[2:15:07] like antibus the faithful martyr they
[2:15:09] held not their lives to death
[2:15:11] often we think that it would be almost
[2:15:12] impossible to be a martyr
[2:15:14] but dare to recall that that faith we
[2:15:16] daily use to triumph in christ jesus
[2:15:20] is the same faith that upholds the
[2:15:22] polycarps
[2:15:23] and all the martyrs
[2:15:26] the same faith that uphill polycarp
[2:15:30] is the same faith upon the brokenhearted
[2:15:32] here this morning
[2:15:34] it's the same faith that's upholding the
[2:15:36] sick
[2:15:37] in this building this morning it's a
[2:15:40] saving faith
