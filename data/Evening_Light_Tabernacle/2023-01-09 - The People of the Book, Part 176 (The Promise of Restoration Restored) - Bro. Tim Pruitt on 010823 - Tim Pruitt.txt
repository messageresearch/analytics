things of the Lord today my didn't we have a wonderful wonderful New Year's Services there amen I tell you God has committed this message to Faithful Men and we're was is one wonderful to me to see young men take the message and have a Zeal and Earnest desire to ministered and ministered with anointing and power amen we certainly appreciate each one of their Ministries I was blessed and I know you were blessed and when you get blessed well I get blessed too amen I I tell you I I love good preaching and I love it when it blesses you and and I trust the Lord will just to just take the things that you heard and and there and we'll just build on it through the new year and through the year to come amen as we opened up the year with wonderful Services may it just continue all the way through amen we're making oh we're we're getting ready for Youth Camp coming up and soon we'll be releasing registration on that and uh unfortunately we still don't have the adult facilities since the the the adult facilities of White House burned and so you know we we kind of have to make do at this moment but it is what it is and we're going to have service like we did last year and have a good time in the Lord amen so we just um appreciate the Lord Brother Donnie Reagan will be with us for that meeting and also brother Ron Spencer his son brother Andrew we're we're going to have them again this year I believe the Lord will just pour out his spirit in a very wonderful way amen so get ready for it amen get prepared and we can start preparations right now as far as I care right in this service this morning amen Genesis chapter 18 verse 9 and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son God bless you you can be seated we're going to be speaking today on the promise of restoration renewed you know that laodicean age has been a an age of restoration actually it started in 1906 with the restoration of the gifts and and they did they believed that that was the promised restoration that God had promised in in Joel chapter 2 and um also many other scriptures and they looked it out and they believed for it but you know God was not through in his restoration so he would he would bring it all the way down to the administration of the son of man and in the and where the ministry of Christ was repeated again and this our day to bring about the restoration that is promised and we are still in that great hour of restoration even this morning as we speak now Sarah as we open our our scene with Sarah she had long dismissed the promise that was given um by God for Abraham and she felt that she had solved that issue many years before when she uh concluded that she was not the one to fulfill that promise and she gave Hagar the slave girl to Abraham to fulfill but in the dispensation of the son of man when the angel came to Sarah calling her by name she had to face it that it was not for someone else else but for her and this is what we're wanting to do is we're wanting to face it this morning that this restoration means me amen it is for us it is our day it is our hour it is our time you see she had believed a lie and so is the church until there's been a great Fallen away and even until this day but God still declares no matter what has happened I'm going to restore God never changes his mind about his word he never abandons a project amen so in the midst of a fallen way there is also a restoration you see Sarah's story had to be changed all these years she had believed the wrong story she had but it become faithful faithless and um disillusioned and bitter sitting in her tents she believed that the child of Abraham and the bonds woman was the promised child and she just accepted as fact that she was unable and that she didn't have enough Faith to be changed because she was 65 when Abraham was was given the promise of a son and it took Faith to believe it then and she didn't have the strength to conceive so she gave the high honors to a slave girl and this same scenario has repeated over and over and over again Through the Ages Luther was given a a promise to bring forth Christ but before he did the lutherans believed the wrong story you see they felt it was impossible to become a book of Acts Church and as the delay went on they gave it over to Bond's woman a slave girl and instead of a book of Acts Church they produced Denise meal a wild man who whose hand was against every man a denomination under the bondage of men and it wasn't long until lutherans was just like the Catholics that they came out of and you know it led by men instead of being led by the Holy Ghost you see this has happened throughout the Reformation over and over and over again the promise given the promise rejected you know believe in the wrong story so that the only thing that was produced was another system of bondage enslaving Souls of man and another denominational system now the first age fell by believing the wrong story you see the supernatural was pushed out and you know was taken over by intellectualism just like Sarah did by the bonds woman and her son you know here that this child was born and this woman now is the um the mother of the of the air and Sarah is basically resigned to the tent and it seemed that um Hagar and his sons were now the error of the promise and Sarah now is an old woman and she no longer felt Abraham's embrace the love affair that they had as a young couple no longer existed you see she even said so when she laughed and said after I'm waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also you know the love of air is over with now that they were all they no longer kissed one another good night they no longer slept in the same bed they she had her tenth Abraham had his tent there was no more pleasure in marriage that's like the church that has lost its first love there is no more hallelujahs no more glories to God there's no more feeling of the warmth of his presence there's no more hearing his voice in the middle of the night and with prophecies and foretelling and giving Assurance you know the closeness is gone well it used to come down as a pillar of fire oh I remember the romance why it was a love affair that tears would come down the cheeks of the Saints and the shadow of the King was in the midst I remember the closeness when men and women were led by the Holy Ghost and and what God would show Visions or manifest himself in dreams and what sometimes we'd pray all night he would come down and he would heal our sick or he would cast out devils and they you know for demons couldn't stay in his presence he was our comforter he was our Prince he was the joy of our heart but that's now a day passed it's just not the season for that that God doesn't do that anymore we're past that we're past that age and we we're now going on and we're more mature with some mature that the marriage is only paper because the spark is now gone the joy is diminished the hope is lost and not of not Faith left to heal a toothache you see you know Sarah smirks and says that which is perfect has come you see we already have an Ishmael it's it's a more excellent way and I'm a resign myself to sit in the tent and just wait for death now that's what some are saying to us today act like old people that all the church should do Sarah at your age you're an old woman quit acting like they did in the book of Acts Church your material church now you're grown up you know better than to act like youngsters yeah you did that when you were young when you were immature but you don't do that now because you're an old woman and your love of air is over and all you got left is bitterness and coldness in your teeth and you might as well resign yourself to thinking and knowing the promise son will never come to you it's already come it's all over with and your love affair is over no more getting drunk in the spirit that's for the immature you're too old for that ah your old bones would Creak and pop can you imagine that no more gifts I mean you can almost smirk in them when you think about that old woman dancing you know no more gifts from the spirit the romance is over why those gifts in the spirit are so insignificant they're only toys they're just trinkets an old woman doesn't need to dress up she's just gonna stay in her old tent she ain't got no purpose there's no plan for her she's just this you know over right fig that's uh too ripe for picking see the church brother Madam said is now engaged it's like a man engaged his wife why does he do what does he do when they're engaged he's just bestowing all things sending presence making her feel good well that's what Christ should do in his church he's sending us gifts of the Spirit how can you be an Engaged then when you are denying these gifts exist they're the very love tokens it's God's tokens to the church Jesus said so these signs shall follow them that believe remember that is our commission and that is the commission we must step into and especially those of us who have received the opening of The Seven Seals which brought back the Gospel of Jesus Christ so that this gospel can be preached in all the world and demonstrated by the preaching of the gospel and then shall the end comes well that was for the church when the church was immaturity remember when we was in love Abraham gave gifts he'd bring in you know little tokens of love and appreciations and you know just things to make you feel good you know but that's when we were just immature and brother random says The Church Must Believe every word every promise ever Iota and claim it for themselves and exercise themselves in it said if I was engaged a girl and I was a single man and I centered something an engagement ring and she wouldn't wear it then that shows she doesn't believe me she doesn't want to be my bride and if Christ sends a church the gifts that he promised and they refuse them and say they're not so they don't want to be the bride of Christ their response to some other lover and not to Christ the bridegroom so the real Church keeps the promise and keeps and accepts the gifts that God sends them that's the real Church that's the restored Church but you know Sarah is in such she's believed the wrong story so long until she'll laugh in the face of God and just say I've accepted it as fact that the days of Miracles are passed that only happened in the Branham meetings you know I I you know you know I I've actually I would need Divine Healing to be changed to receive a son and I'm not going to some Tent Revival I I ain't going there ain't gonna be no Revival in my tent our church is too old I'll be mature for that I you know we're just too mature you know that love affair was to never end you see the promise of power which was to the apostles that was endowed at Pentecost he said it's to you Jews and to your children Jews and to them that are far off Gentiles and to as many as the Lord Our God shall call both Jew and Gentile until he stops calling the Pentecostal message and power will not cease amen and if you believe your prophets that's his word amen but but you see what happened to the story of the church was turned by nicolaitan spirit somewhere she stopped believing she stopped believing this was for her and that the power that she received at Pentecost was for her she stopped believing the son of Hagar was resistant to the promised restoration and when it came he mocked and he made fun of it he persecuted Isaac and that spirit will always make fun and persecute the supernatural brother random tells us in the church of his book no matter how just or uprighted Christian is doing before the public and how gracious he is to his fellow man do not but good but let him confess Christ as a savior and acknowledge the operation of the gifts of the holy spirit in tongues prophecies healing Miracles he will be condemned the spirit of the world hates the spirit of God because it can overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth dwells now this is Brother Brandon's prayer as he approached the church ages and as he moves into his commission you know because it's not until the church ages that he ever refers to Malachi for the Elijah prophet and turns to that scripture and shows us that Elijah was to come to bring a restoration and so the first thing he does says he preaches the church Jesus I want you to know that was Supernatural it had to be Supernatural there was it was written in the Bible it's Seven Stars you know seven seven stars seven golden candlesticks so uh seven churches or seven churches and and it took a revelation from God that would come to the prophet to identify those Messengers and the ages so you know under the Prophet Elijah there you know by Vision we were able to understand where we have come from starting out in the first days and then how it declined and it went down and it come back up and comes all the way to the end where that the alpha is the Omega and the grain that was planted at the beginning is the grain that's at the end now brother Branham as he prayed as he approached those churches he said May during this meeting cause men and women to take a new hold newly may you raise up speakers with tongues interpreters of tongues may you raise up gifts of Prophecy raise up preachers and pastors evangelists and so forth that the church might be edified raise up missionaries to go in the field Yonder and bring forth this glorious gospel where the word shall go may it fall into good ground bringing forth a hundredfold for we believe we're at the end of the age and the consummation is near now that's what his desire was for the church what he asked God for for this last age today we have too many lecturers in the pulpit and God is not in it lectures are men who can stand up and explain the word in such a way it's just breathtaking but it's just a lecture it's just an educational talk it is the mechanics without Dynamics you see it's just what they call today a TED Talk that means technology entertainment and Design By the way a TED talk you know it's just um it's just kind of a nice little talk Of of uh inventions and things that are going on and it's informative and whatever but it's a lecture and the gospel was never intended to be in the hands of lecturers but men that are called by God and anointed by God amen this is what we want to see when we when we hear a Minister preach we want to see there is anointing with that and that signs follow that Ministry now brother Brandon brother Branham told us you know what Satan would do he said Satan you know get in it to try to make it all mechanics that's word and no Dynamics back all Dynamics and no mechanics but we got to put it together we've got the we've got the power of the Holy Spirit but we've got to combat with the word to feed this machine we can't feed it on Creed it won't burn it it chokes up the blues it will not burn it it was made for the word of God man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out the mouth of God so you see again Satan gets in it to make it one way or the other you know just all mechanics and no Dynamics are all Dynamics which is cranking on the engine well we got sparked somebody's shouting and dancing around the room but they can't run down the road to Deliverance oh we've got all mechanics we got the car all polished and looking nice filled with guys and it's got octane power in it but no spark it's got to have both to produce Deliverance amen well you know a lot of people you know want to criticize and say well I tell you I saw some of them jump and shout and whatever and go out and live like Devils well I've seen some of them get so intellectual too and have all kinds of knowledge of the word and go out and live like devils pot can call kettle black it takes a worship in spirit and in truth hey man we we don't want Dynamics just cranking on the machine without the mechanics without the word amen you got to have both of them but we don't want just all work work and you can't even crank the engine there's no spark it don't go nowhere and it neither one of those deliver y now but brother Branham said there ought to be a holy power surrounding and in the church that will make demons flee and instead of that it's become a laughing stocks what is it mechanics instead of the Dynamics now I want to just turn over to Revelation 2 14 for a moment and then we'll look at an earlier scripture in Revelation 2 also in the Ephesians age but let's just kind of review a few things here thou Hast them that hold the doctrine of Balaam notice this he said I have a few things against you because their house has their them that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat up things sacrificing the idols and to commit fornication so now again we already spoke about nicolaitanism we'll go in to find that a little more here in a moment but now you just can't have a and I'm quoting from the churches book you just can't have a nicolaitan set up in the church and not have this other Doctrine the doctrine of Balaam come into you see if you take away the word of God and the moving of the spirit as a move means of worship they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth then you will have to give the people another form of worship as a substitute and substitution spells balamism so what's now you if you take away the word of God and the moving of the spirit see they've got to be both of them together now listen church this is what separates us from Azusa Pentecost because they have Spirit without Word amen now of course you know to have word without Spirit you're just as bad as them it's up to you you're probably a couple of churches behind them over in the Baptist or methodists so now you see but if you if you take away this word and the spirit the movement of the spirit as meaning of worship then you have to give the people another form of worship as a substitute and this is balamism It Works hand in hand with nicolaitanism now in the again as he said so Israel came up to the borders of Moab sent Messengers to the king saying we're brothers let us pass to your land if our people are animals eat or drink anything we'll gladly pay for it but King balak got very excited that head of that nicolaitan Bunch was not about to let the church come through with its signs and wonders and divers manifestations of the Holy Ghost with their faces shining with the glory of God it was too risky as he might lose some of his crowd so balak refused to let Israel pass through in fact so great was his fear of them that he went to Highland Prophet called Balaam and asked him to mediate between him and God and petition the almighty to curse Israel and render them impotent and Balaam being eager to take part in political Affairs become a great man was only too glad to do that but seeing he had to approach to and receive an audience from God to get the people cursed as he could not do that by himself he went to ask God if he could have permission to go now isn't that just like the Nicolaitans we have with us today they curse everyone that won't go their way so Balaam went down and he set up seven halters for the seven clean Beast of sacrifice he killed a ram signifying the coming of the Messiah he knew what to do to approach him to God he had the mechanics just right but not the Dynamics is now can't you see it Nicolaitans there was Israel down there in the valley offering the same sacrifice doing the same things but only one had signs following only one had got in the midst forms won't get you anywhere it can't take place it can't take the place of spirit manifestations that's what happened at nicaea they put balaam's Doctrine not the doctrine of God they put balaams over in balaam's Doctrine not the doctrine of God they stumbled yay they fell they became dead men now understand the Dynamics is the Holy Ghost when it came originally it did not come word only neither did it come Spirit only but it was the word being manifested displayed amen now Peter would immediately say this is that which the prophet Joel spoke of so he said it's the scripture being made alive it's the spirit quickened or the spirit quickening the word and this is what you're seeing this word becoming flesh now so again first Thessalonians 1 5 for Our Gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance so now here's how the gospel is it comes not just word but it's also coming with power and in the Holy Ghost so it comes with a display of the power of God that's how we know it's the word because otherwise it's just a Creed or a Dogma even though it's quoting scripture remember Satan quoted scripture he quoted quotes amen and he lined up his quotes to get Jesus to disobey God and the spirit of God wasn't in it come on Church amen now and it is the rising of the sun he said you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as he is the word is the father living the father sent me so send I you as the father fired me and pushed me into everything I do that only that which is pleasing to God so as he sent me a so send by you with the same mechanics and it takes the same Dynamics operated and these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics the Dynamics will take his place so if we claim to have the mechanics the word the Dynamics got to take its place with the word Paul said the gospel came not but to us in word only through gasoline only but through spark also to make it move there you are it came to us in that manner and as I said it'll make the car move down to Divine Healing to an overcoming life amen to Salvation to receiving the Holy Ghost to any promise of God it'll make that car move down to it amen now but I want to get this to you church so that you are fully assured as God would impart to us some of the last things by this by the seventh angel messenger he would speak as John 14 where Jesus leaving his disciples said I go to prepare a place for you and brother Brandon would preach a sermon things that are to be this is what you can expect you know I I'm leaving here but you can expect here you can expect this to happen things that are to be and I believe he said that's the same thing we live in today God bearing record of his word vindicating what he said he would do now we know this is the day of salvation where God is calling men from the world from a life of sin to a life of service and in the day that God has poured out his Spirit from on high great signs and wonders or to accompany the ministry of this day amen this is when the former latter rain are falling together and we know they're supposed to be great signs and wonders which in many the great denominations this is turned down but I'm thankful for these open doors like I've had to get into and the inspiration is given to young men like your pastor here that calls him is I'm beginning to get old and no my days are numbered and know that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord if he doesn't come in my generation which I'm hoping to see him I look daily for my what's keeping myself prepared for that hour now so again this is what he expected not only for his day but to follow in young men who would sweep it on to the coming of the Lord amen now of course you know it would be a time where great signs and wonders where that he would say former and latter rain Fallen together great signs and wonders to accompany the ministry of this day this must be what is happening in The Bride of Jesus Christ she is to be a renewed woman with renewed faith a people who the promise of restoration has been accepted and is renewed in them and it's causing a renewal in their life are you with me now all right now so there again you know first love you know a child comes from Love you mean me and Abraham are going to have a love affair again well let's just talk about it for a minute let's see how the church became like Sarah in the tent old disillusioned haven't forgot the promise believe the wrong story because church this is our condition this is where the church has been through many many years they believed the wrong story they believed a lie I mean come on you I can take you easily and just show you Trinity the trinitarian doctrine what did they do they believed the wrong story somebody distorted the story and they believed a lie and that lie today will damn you if you don't turn from it come on we have to come back and believe in one God again because we got a one-god Bible amen we're one God people now first of all as we look at this we're going to see how Sarah kind of fell out of love you know and you turn with me to Revelation 2 and 1 and we'll read from there and as we're going in here I want you to just think it's the Ephesus to the Church of Ephesus now Ephesus means to let go relax backslidden they were called by God the backslidden church and God acknowledged first their Works their labor their patience he rebuked their their their living for or leaving their first love for backsliding for no longer bearing light Ephesus was not a deceived Church it failed Itself by not continuing in perfect love now so as we look here in Revelation 2 and 1. I want to just as we have preface it we're going to talk about the angel to the Church of Ephesus right these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick and of course that was Christ and he walks through every age and he's walking in this age today don't let nobody mess your mind up we're here in the laoter cnh where Christ is still walking among his people now he said I know that works and I labor and thy patience and I know thou cannot bear them with your evil and they have tried them that say their Apostles and are not and you found them liars and you're born and had patience and from my namesake and uh you have labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left that first love remember therefore from Once Thou Art fallen so she's already a fallen woman and repent and do the verse works or else I will come unto thee quickly and I'll remove that Candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou has the hate us the Deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate so you know he says now you believe he said this is what I got against you you've left your first love here's Sarah was and she says there's no love affair anymore and it ain't possible that's the condition of the end time Church that was what was happening here as the Fallen away began they lost their first love notice but there was also among them Deeds of the Nicolaitans now I'm going to take some Snippets from the Ephesian Church age not to church each book but as brother Brandon preached it and I'm just going to share with you just some one-liners here that I've I have picked out of this first love he said but there's something I got against you that that is you have left your verse loved you left the love you have had for them good old-fashioned Holy Ghost meetings and you begin to kind of slide backwards into that formal come in with a Our Father and then he said what did you do you lost your first lost your first love oh you couldn't get on them Corners with a tambourine to clap their hands and praise God oh no oh to formal they can't say Amen no more my goodness he'd break up some of their makeup if God had doubt against this church he's got against he's got against Thatcher that one too because you have left your first love I got it against you I have something to get you that's my complaint you once had a great time but you let the world creep in and you got to act in a little formal oh mercy what we need is back to our first love back to Pentecost not Azusa Street now Pentecost you see you see it started out like a figure when the seal was open it showed the Antichrist Spirit coming in as a spirit that looked like Christ riding on a white horse which should represent Purity and Holiness but it was an Insidious spirit that began to come in and begin to and to begin to conquer to conquer the laity now again in the second seal brother Branham tells about this he said this horse rider went forth as as we background in it till he hit the seal the notices white horse rider when he went out he serves in three stages the devil as I proved to you the other night is in a trinity like God but it's the same devil all the time in three stages notice in his stages in the first stage he come in the Holy Ghost fell and people had everything in common and the spirit of God was upon them and the apostles went from house to house breaking bread with the people and there was great signs and wonders Roth and the first thing you know the Satan began to cause a murmur to come up and then after a while those slaves and the poor of the land were to received the Holy Ghost they went out into different places testifying and testified to their masters and after a while they began to come in all like Army captains and different people as celebrity see the gallantry and the Miracles and the signs that these men had done so they accepted Christianity well you see when when these Army captains and bosses and so on accepted embraced Christianity you know and go down there to a place where they're meeting in a little old dark dingy Hall clap their hands and Shout speaking in tongues and getting messages why he could never take to that that to his competitor or or he said whatever it is his associate in business he would he he'd never believe it like that certainly not so he's got to dress it up so notice what the Antichrist Spirit wants to do to the church he wants to refine it you know it wants to make it where there's nothing happening in the laity there's no shout of the king in their midst he wants to make it where that there is no manifestation of the Holy Ghost there the only manifestation of the Holy Ghost can be in the pulpit so he's got to dress it up so in this he goes on the second seal so they get together and begin to think well we'll form something a little different Jesus said immediately at the first church age I have he got said something he told him in the second chapter of Revelation here I've got somewhat against you because the Deeds of the Nicholas and Nico conquer the laity in other words instead of everybody be one they want to make some holy fellow they want to make it some kind of they want to pattern in paganism from where they come out of and they've finally done it in first nicolaitan Nicolaitans called into Bible Antichrist because it was against the original doctrine of Christ and the apostles now brother Branham immediately goes in to give us a modern example of a nicolaitan so the next paragraph he tells us I don't call the man's name he's a great man but I was at his meetings a few years ago so this is the first hand account he said I shook his hand and he said you know we have such today to call they call Pentecostals he said they rely upon the book of Acts and he said you see acts was only scaffold work for the church now would you imagine a man that just studied the Bible a gallon old man studied the Bible the way this fellow has and would remake A remark like that it doesn't even sound like the holy spirit is around it's got to it's got not to be nowhere so this was a lecturer because anybody would come and understanding would know that the acts of the apostle was not the Acts of the Apostles it was the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles amen now brother random tells his story on several occasions said one plan one place he said I went and I spoke to the man and said that was a great sermon but he said I just want to remind you the scaffold is needed to the last piece is put on the on the building and he said as long as God is calling we still need the book of Acts we still need the scaffold work to put that at the Top If it's at the very top spire so to put the Capstone on the church which is the physical literal return of Jesus Christ we will need the scaffold work we will need the apostolic way right down to the end to the finish of stone now today we have some we have the same Alexander Campbell Church of Christ Doctrine that's being preached in message pulpits excuse me outside a little bit that ain't right but we'll get another microphone but we're going to work with this today we have the same type everybody's heard of the Church of Christ today they're not Church of Christ they're Church of the Antichrist and the reason I say that because they're anti-anointing Christ means the anointing and if there ever was a group of people against Miracles healing Deliverance signs wonders everything is the what is called The Church of Christ it's uh that the Christian Church the Church of Christ anyway it's a move started by Alexander Campbell brother random called them Campbell lights these are the said the same sermon that Dr best preached brother Brandon said he preached a good old Camelot sermon that in the Millennium will have healing but we don't have it now that it ain't for today so you know they withstood him all the way to the end brother Branham with every breath he had fought against this spirit and I was saying it's now being preached in message pulpits [Music] amen against the anointing against the move of the Holy Spirit against the works of God you see and and it and it's taught here's the teaching that since the word was restored and we now have that which is perfect the perfect word that and it's calmed and that which is in part is done away with this is nothing more than the Campbell light Doctrine so they say they've worked their way around well we're not going to have the a book of Acts Church we're going to have another book of Acts and it's not going to be like that one verse 6 that we read but this thou Hast you hate the Deeds of the Nicolaitans I'm going to tell you you're going to have to be like them hate the Deeds of the Nicolaitans we don't hate people but we hate the Deeds the thing that thing that that is to conquer the laity Nicole brother banham said which means to conquer overthrow Nicolaitans overthrower conquer the laity what they were trying to do here was trying to take to church where God had Pastors in the spirit of God moving by gifts in the in the Church of the Living God that God said he hated he hates it yet today Nicolaitans nickel overcome overthrow the laity the laity is a church I mean he knows the lady is a church all right overthrow or a conqueror and take the place of the laity in other words take all the sacredness all the power from the church and put it on the priest or the preachers let the congregation live the way it wants to but the priest is the Holy One you're not about the way it is you know yeah we expect the preacher to live holy and do right but you know you you gotta you gotta have your your problem with porn you know you can't help it it's just your Humanity but you know somehow we got a an elite class that oh they can live right they're the ones adopted by the way they're the ones that's mature and and whatever but you you you underlings you just can't do it yet power hadn't come for you to live right now so he said he said here put it on them taken the Holy Ghost away from the people with signs and wonders following them and take it away and give them a holy priesthood taking away the Holy Ghost and swapping it for a priesthood that it is today only preachers only the priests can live an overcoming life because the Holy Ghost is taken away from the people you see you know you can't help but stumble and fall and make a big mess of yourself because you ain't adopted yet and when you get adopted well you'll be sealed and you won't do that no more but until that comes you're just in a mess and we don't know when that's going to be or how it happens but it'll come someday what about you preaching oh we've we're already adopted but brother Brandon said where is the first love you once had um where is that Joy you used to have as David once cried oh Lord restore to me the joy of my salvation wear them all night prayer meetings the tears on your cheek out the church the resurrected Lord Jesus with signs and wonders among the Believers and overseer trying to take the Holy Ghost away from the laity I'm I'm talking I'm using these Snippets of what he's told he's explaining how that preachers do by like Balaam substituting substituting something instead of the power of God by the word are you with me now so you see Satan knows Satan knows that if he can just get you to substitute and acts to experience with just accepting the message he knows he's got you defeated that you'll never rise above your sins you'll never be an overcomer they'll never be healing in the church and miracles and signs and wonders and gifts of the Spirit because all you have is an intellectual knowledge mechanics without Dynamics Satan knows surely the original church at Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else's faults so you know Sarah's over in the tent looked like the story is false story of her ever having a child that's history it ain't gonna happen I had it here this Ishmael this Ishmael move was all all the life all the power you see like in the Catholic Church you see they they took it and made it where place it upon a priesthood where the priests held the Holy Ghost in his hand a wafer and you take the holy wafer stick out your tongue put it on you he puts it on you see the Holy Ghost comes from the preacher and it's applied from the preacher to your tongue and there you receive the Holy Ghost Protestant the same way come down the altar join the church put your name on a book and shake hands with the preacher again it's a preacher administering the Holy Ghost instead of having a personal experience with God yourself now the message said in your seat don't dare come to an altar and snot and cry and have Godly sorrow for your sins just make your confession of faith in the message and the prophet and you got the Holy Ghost now in many I I wanted to say this in many message churches today this is sad but there's no further step ever taken than water baptism no subsequent baptism of the Holy Ghost no experience and marriage and divorce brother Madam says this he is a place where God has put his name the only place to worship you're not a Christian because you're a Protestant you're not a Christian because you're Catholic you're not a Christian because your Methodist Baptist or Pentecostal and let me inject this part you are not a Christian because you're a message believer you are Christian because you have been baptized into Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit listen to him now not by water there is one more one Faith one Lord one baptism and that is Holy Spirit baptism water baptism inducts you into Fellowship the Holy Spirit baptism inducts you into Christ there is the truth so water baptism inducts you into Fellowship The Fellowship of the church amen but but he said adult but then the holy spirit in baptism it ducts you into Christ so you see there must be something that follows baptism water baptism into is not the end-all now brother branham's labored on this nicolaitan Darren Ephesian age and he says God help me to make this real a bunch of Christians in a church like this now he points out his own church a bunch of Christians just like you they got formal and indifferent and pulled off and set themselves up an organization and then United in the Dark Ages with the state now remember it didn't have any papers it was only a spirit of organization and then in the night the state and the church become what Christian Church Holy Catholic churches the word Catholic means Universal the great Universal Christian church and called the people that spoke in tongues and shouted and healed the sick and so forth Heretics so I want you to look at this he said it started out with a bunch of Christians just like this they got formal and indifferent and pulled off all message believers amen all listening to tapes all of them saying Branham Branham amen and you know they they got indifferent and and formal and then they began to call the people that spoke with tongues and shouted and healed the sick Heretics and finally made it so constraneous until anybody was caught worshiping that way was throwing the Lions being that they wouldn't Embrace Catholicism and that went on for these hundreds of years back there like that of persecution and that church never died you can't kill it God said it would live to them and he's given a crown of life so I'm going to tell you I'm warning you devil you can't kill us you can't stop us there's going to be an end time people no matter how impossible it looks Hallelujah no matter how long the promise has been delayed God promised a restoration there'll be a people who are changed by this message and restored back to the original that's what the message does that's what the son of man came to do then he says then I come Martin Luther to continue the age and he swung the church out under justification what happened when Luther died they organized and made a Lutheran Church they got a Doctrine when they organized it what they do it gave birth right back into romanism again didn't come Wesley and Whitfield and George Whitfield and many others in Asbury and many of them was great revivalists they saved the world in that day they had a Revival in that Philadelphian age that saved to England and the United States too they had meetings where they were kicked out and called Holy Rollers you methodists was done that they'd throw they'd fall in the floor under the power of God and they would throw water in their face and fan them that's right and they jerked so hard to they said they had the jerks and they there was people who would jerk and Shake under the power of the Holy Ghost that's Methodist history from there come the Quakers and so forth and now they organized it now notice they organized a movement against the Holy Ghost and put it all the Holy Spirit upon the clergy where they were to administer the holy ghost in a formal way of believing when you believe what I say is the truth you have the Holy Ghost so again it is a clergy controlling who receives the Holy Ghost and it's not an experience with you and God alone it's you and a minister as you agree to what he says then you have the Holy Spirit if you receive my Doctrine so you see and instead of experience God for yourself then the Holy Ghost becomes something administered by the clergy instead of an experience coming down upon you of the Holy Ghost now the doctrines of the Nicolaitans was a false revelation it was not with the word and and they called them Liars they call them false Apostles and false prophets so the true church held on to the original teaching of Saint Paul and the baptism of the Holy Ghost with signs following and confirming the word that Paul taught amen show me where God will ever Colonel confirmed the word of sprinkling now he starts with different words that the clergy is teaching and he's he said now let's see if God will confirm that so he said show me where God will ever confirm the word of sprinkling show me where God will ever confirm and bring speaking in tongues and great things just by shaking hands with the pastor somewhere or putting your name on a book and still chewing smoke and drink in line telling lies a card party is having a little fun going oh mercy that's carnal false prophet friends so it produces no cure for sin only treatment for sin you see some psychology some encouraging words just a pat on the back a little prayer told the girl a little more hey it ain't working people are still in porn still feeding them movies still telling continue telling lies you hear me the question came up in the Bible is there no Obama Gilead is there no physician there said the prophet then why is the disease of my daughter not healed what's the matter with the church what's the matter we got too many old sick churches because we have had quack drugs and now even in their message they're giving out the prescription wrong now what did this prescription say you know what it said Peter he was given the keys right amen give him the keys the kingdom he's got the ink pen to write the prescription amen Peter you're going to write it and I'm going to give you I'm going to give you the prescription the keys to the kingdom and he said when they heard this all nice to Broad this was screaming and shouting speaking in tongues and and having such a time they said these men are full of new wine and Peter said these are not full of new wine as you suppose see in this third hour today but this is that was spoken by the prophet Joel it'll come to pass in the last day I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and upon my hands made my maid servants will I pour out my spirit and they shall prophesy also signs in the heavens above the earth below firing smoking paper and said them to pass it whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved and furthermore what do you say about David the patriarch David foresight he saw said Boy Over My Flesh shall rests in Hope because he'll not leave my soul in Hell neither will he suffer his holy one to seek corruption let me speak to you Brethren of patriarch David he's both dead and buried his sepulchers with us to this day but he being a prophet saw the resurrection of Christ let it be known to you that this Jesus whom you have crucified with Wicked hands have made God it made him both Lord and Christ and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said men and Brethren or Dr Simon Peter write us a prescription how can we get this we want a cure for sin now watch him what he said and you'll find out where the church has got off track wait a minute I'm going to write your prescription it's going to be Eternal prescription it'll be for you to your children to them that are far off that as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen and he said what did he say how did he fix it how did Peter fix or prepare the prescription think of it day of Pentecost repent how are you going to get this experience of that looks like new wine how are you going to be filled with the Holy Ghost repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost or the Holy Ghost as a gift the person will come unto you come on church amen and this is your promise write as many as the Lord Our God shall call to the last one called that Eternal prescription is in effect how did he fix he said like the Catholics did it you say you know they fixed up a prescription with infant baptism you know you don't you you you're born into the Catholic Church by natural birth so you're born into the church and then of course at Communion when you take to wafer you receive the Holy Ghost that's how they prepare the prescription does it bring life does it pure sin no you know he says like the Baptists have it like the methodists have it so the Methodist and Baptists they fixed it when the Methodist got ashamed of the emotion listen to me and they wanted to dress up the church they want to you know make it a little more refined and a little more you know acceptable to everybody I mean this screaming and falling out under the spirit and and jerking under the power we can't have that happening in our meetings so they begin to fix a prescription and the they they when they got ashamed of motion brother Brandon said those methodists that fell on the floor and they throwed water in their face from the spirit striking them through sanctification and so they fix it we don't need the spirit just join the church just seek ends with the preacher and make a confession of faith and that became their prescription but it doesn't keep them from the death angel look what's happening in methodism today look at the right in their pulpits women preachers lesbians homosexuals every time an interviews they they can't keep from sinning they even preach you can't stop sinning because they have no sin cure because they've messed with the prescription they are quack druggist will you say Amen to that now brother Branham said every one of them has added something or taken something from it like the Pentecostals they added or took away and we know what they did they added a requirement to speak for tongues until they forced the members to speak with tongues and when when some couldn't they just taught him how Pentecostals took the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues it got them down the Altar and made them say something over and over until they spoke in tongues they and so they took again a Creed a Dogma over receiving the person of Christ and again it was something controlled and imparted by the ministry who would teach you how to receive the Holy Ghost by having you jabber words now the message people hadn't been so squeaky clean either I'm coming down to home now oh we have a restored truth and our truth the restored truth is now receiving the Holy Ghost without sensation that's what it is so you know it's without feeling it's without anything happening you know you don't know when it comes you don't you just you just believe what we're preaching is the truth so it's again nicolaitanism administering the Holy Ghost you know you hear him say oh the Jews the Jews did receive it with emotion but that's not how the Gentiles received it this is they say you well the Gentiles they received the Holy Ghost as Peter spoke this word without any emotions now that ain't Bible that's preached from pulpits but that ain't Bible let me read what the Bible said about the house of Cornelia and the Gentiles and when it went to them and while Peter spoke these words acts 10 44 while Peter spoke these words the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard the word and they are the circumcision was believed were astonished as many as come with Peter because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God so it didn't come without sensation to the Gentiles without feeling without anything happening you see that is not listen listen to me I want you to be very careful how you hear this that is not a restored truth that is a demonic nicolaitan dumb of the Baptist Methodist Catholic Church of Christ that is their Dogma that you receive the Holy Ghost without sensation you just believe and you got it you don't need a sensation no experience with God is necessary you just receive our Creed you decide to receive I believe you believe that Jesus Christ the son of God and he says he's the savior of the world you've got the Holy Ghost when you believe it and we bring it right down to the message the same old demonic Doctrine and say while you hear the word preached while this Doctrine is going forth right in your seat you're getting the Holy Ghost and the evidence is because you believe the word that I'm saying so again we have nicolaitan and the pulpits in message pulpets now you see where this puts us it puts the spirit the power of the spirit under the administration of a Preacher where as he releases his Doctrine you get the Holy Ghost instead of receiving the spirit yourself through the administration of the spirit coming to you as an individual as you yield yourself to it but I want you to say that that is a quote at least a partial quote you see that's the way the devil does it he comes along and gives you part of the word instead of all the word so finish the quote The Mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Jesus Christ in you the same Works performing in you the same works that he did so the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the person of Christ not a sensation not a jump not a dance but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did what works did Jesus do after receiving the Holy Ghost well one thing he overcome the devil amen he also spoke in tongues he also prophesied he also healed the sick he also cast out devil it was more than a sensation amen it was more than a good feeling it was the power of an overcoming life among overcoming Temptation overcoming casting out Devils overcoming sickness and disease now in the palm of worm Locus and caterpillar brother Branham said there is no place in the Bible and you you can find this yourself no place in the Bible where they ever see the Holy Ghost without having a motion speaking with tongues and shouting and Praises of God and prophecies and manifestations they never did just walk up and shake hands with a preacher and walk away no place now let's carry it a little further on that he says now you can receive the Holy Ghost and maybe you didn't speak with tongues when you get it and that's true you can have the Holy Spirit and not have that manifestation but he said if you will just constantly lay there before God all the time with baptism after baptism striking you something's got to take place you get so full to you can't talk nothing else you just try to say something and you can't say it no more and you just can't say it and many times if people just realize that that was the Holy Spirit they just go ahead and just open up their heart and let God speak to them and he said I don't want his honor a great gift that God has given I believe that a Spirit-filled man or woman or child that lives under the altar of God won't live there long until they'll be speaking with tongues I believe he will do that or she amen so you know that's all I'd say lay under this under the spirit of God lay under the fountain till you get so full of the spirit of God till it bubbles over until it fulfills Joel 2 28. till it fulfills Isaiah 28 18. till it fulfills all the word of God come on everybody we ought to be a people that seeks to have everything every promise that God has to be manifested in our lives now brother Brandon would tell you this as he explains it in the foreseal and I'm not going to read it but he said you know he makes it clear it's not a Baptist idea of just believing on the Lord he said see Abraham believe God it was imputed to him for righteousness but God gave him a sign of circumcision as a confirmation he had accepted his face faith so that's the same thing we must do we must wait on the Holy Spirit till it's done something not necessarily because we spoke in tongues not because we've danced or we got emotional we shouted but until we're changed until something actually happened he said I don't care what form it comes in just so it happened that's the main thing so you see we're not trying to get somebody you got to speak in tongues or you got to prophesy it don't matter what form it comes in as long as your life has been changed and you're a different person and you got overcoming power in you come on now Christ's living in you and his person in your life is greater than having any gift to the spirit because you can have gifts of the Spirit and not have the spirit but the body of Believers that has the spirit will have gifts of the Spirit but what do you say repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost an eternal prescription is for you it's to your children that'll last through every Church age give it to every one of them so God wants us all to have that same prescription amen don't mess with it don't be a quack you see I wanted to say the baptism of the Holy Ghost is much more than a profession of faith it is the person of Jesus Christ amen you know it's my let me go back it's much more than just being justified and forgiven of your sin it's as much more than quit drinking and smoking or doping it is much more than exercising the gift of the spirit it is the person of Christ coming to live in Tabernacle on the inside of you so that you living the life anymore it ain't you trying anymore if you're still trying you're still under the law [Applause] but if you're under grace it's because you have received the spirit of God and the spirit of God brings your members your hands your feet your mouth your mind subject to the word of God Hallelujah and it's your evidence that you're going in the rapture so you see it's not just a sin's face not just a good feeling not just an emotion it's a person of Christ and though listen carefully though it was is not a sensation it don't come without emotion it never has and it never will it doesn't come without feeling it never has and never will you'll never get the Holy Ghost and not know it unless you're doctrinally confused and then you wonder and Ponder but brother Branham after they says this about Sin you know the Holy Ghost without sensation in in God and simplicity as the seals open God unfolded himself not in Sensations no but Sensations yet with it is not a sensation sensation comes with it Again The Sixth Seal it is an emotion though a motion accompanies it see the difference it's not it's not the emotion but emotion does accompany it and then he says in a paradox emotions screaming crying and so forth cannot be explained but it's a paradox how God does it it's the Unseen God dwelling in the human heart making himself visible by vindicating his word that he's the same yesterday today and forever so you see it's it's a miracle he's an emotions screaming crying cannot be explained it's a paradox a miracle how God does it now man can manufacture it and man can impersonate the sensation but they can't impersonate the indwelling of the spirit of God Hallelujah because that is God himself coming to that Tabernacle the human being amen and brother Bradham said again in the world falling apart you people standing here that was at the altar now look don't you rely upon some emotion although it has emotion in it now the ripened seed the grain the mature Church will bring Christ back like he was at the beginning but this time he will be in Bride form so in the Mighty God unveiled brother Brandon said it's right to bring him back just exactly like he was in the beginning his same Ministry somebody say same Ministry all right let's try this the same Jesus amen the same power the same Holy Ghost the same one that came down on the day of Pentecost amen that is the same holy ghost that is manifested today from glory to glory to glory and it's not back to his Original Seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the same signs same signs same wonders amen same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power the same sensation it's from glory to glory and the next will be changed from this Glory into a body like his own voice body what we shall see him Hallelujah he said Abraham saw this this is what Abraham saw this is what Sarah saw [Applause] well but that's out of church order well brother Brandon said I've seen jumping spells and joy spells and nobody was hurt the mountains rung out and the sun went down and everything took place but nobody there was nobody hurt and I've seen meetings where the power of God was revealed to the people that they were free from the world and the things of the world and the joy the Lord filled the congregation and they stood and screamed and cried and shouted to the top of their voice for the glory of God I never did see anything disorderly there was always right in order because they had recognized that their name had been written on the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world Hallelujah that's what gives us joy we recognize that's why we cry have a father father and you say you son I'm not a child of the world I'm not a child of sin but not a child of utterly I'm a child of the Living God Hallelujah now nowhere in the Bible did they just receive the Holy Ghost and not know it when but instead when they were filled with the spirit all glorified God every time here's what they had in common people you know bless their hearts the Azusa people it was at um in Kansas before it come to Azusa they had a they had a school there and they were studying the book of Acts and they were excited and they were praying that there would be another book of Acts and they'd get the Holy Ghost like they did in the book of Acts and they brother part of him I believe it was some brother brother Parham had had instructed them now look I want you to study the Bible to see if there's anything in common if they all have something in common when they initially received the Holy Ghost and so they went to studying and the students come up with uh what they believed an answer three out of the five times that they received the Holy Ghost they spoke with other tongues in other languages so they made this the initial sign that you had been filled with the Holy Ghost based on three out of five times the Holy Ghost came that they spoke in tongues this became a dogma and it caused people even even daddy Seymour warned him do not seek for tongues seek to receive the spirit he said if I go down to a store and I want a pair of shoes I don't ask for tongues I asked for the shoe and the tongue comes with the shoe now that was the that was the Pentecostal fathers realizing the fallacy of seeking the gift without The Giver and they went astray anyway and they built an organization on that and that became the Dogma were that you have Pentecostals who will speak in tongues and they declare I've got the Holy Ghost and living a undoubtly life because they had the initial evidence I'm now saved don't you dare bother that either they you dare tell them that that the Holy Ghost is not the evidence they'll curse you to their face to your face you're not taking that from them you know it's their anchor it's their is it's it's their typos and so this is what they believe no matter what kind of Life they live just come back and speak in tongues again we're going backslide every day we can't help it we can't overcome we can't live the life you know we're gonna we're gonna make mistakes like that and we're just going hey if you slip and go back to drink just come back and speak and tell you if you go out you know backslide long enough you wanna you you want a different husband backslide a little bit and go out and find you another man and then come back and speak in tongues you're okay and that's what happened but nowhere nowhere in the Bible did they speak or did they have the Holy Ghost and not know it instead they were filled with the spirit and I want you to get this oh glorified God and I don't care what the language you glorify men here's what you want to see in your life that your life glorifies Jesus Christ well I I dance in the spirit by the Tim two hours I spoken I I don't care nothing about that I won't see one thing in your life here's the evidence I want to see that from now on amen this is your typos your life verifies Jesus Christ [Applause] Hallelujah now so you see they would speak in other languages and even when they spoke in other languages they were heard in those languages glorifying God it fulfilled the scripture Peter said it did how many believes that it fulfilled come on Peter said this is that don't shut down on me this is Sunday morning amen and we you know I preached twice in a week both times on Sunday Timothy does his hour on on Wednesday night or brother Joe or brother Aaron they do their hour on wins tonight I do my hours Sunday starting somewhere just before 12 and Sunday morning I do my second hour in the afternoon now we could take a break and come back but we're doing it like this we're putting them all together now hang on now for me don't quit and go home on me I ain't true you see it fulfilled the scripture notice the experience had to match the word is that right it fulfilled Joel 2 Peter said it did this is that which the prophet Joel said he you know where he said my he would pour out his spirit and my sons and daughters shall prophesy you see their lives would glorify God it fulfilled Isaiah's prophecy that was stubborn lips and other tongues of spirit spoke to them through them to the people and it took cowards and made them Brave somebody help me preach I'm talking about men and women that were hiding up in an upper room come spilling out and they're not ashamed of what is went on Hallelujah but they're they're emboldened by what is going on Amen that they are now declaring everywhere that Jesus Christ is alive he is resurrected from the dead and he's now living in me it took cowards and made them Brave it took deniers of Christ and made them speak boldly and Proclaim Christ it took a liar like Peter and made him Proclaim truth it cured sin it took Sanctified men and women and fill them with the spirit until they were drunk as if they had taken wine now this is what it did now don't stop it don't stop it that's what I'm saying don't stop it let it come through let it come through let it you know how you some people are afraid of the sensation I'm not afraid of this sensation but go beyond the sensation Let It Go through until you get the Holy Ghost so I prayed until I got a feeling I'm glad for the feeling but until your life has changed keep pressing through don't give up brother Branham talks about this and the Methodist he said Wesley had a Revival the people would fall out in the floor with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they'd pour water in their face and fan them till they'd lay all night on the floor till too bad you had pictures of waters you might have come through he said Wesley the Holy Ghost could have fallen before Azusa Street but they stopped it he said too bad you had pictures of water because it didn't get praying they would have got through um amen they poured water in his face and Shake him oh he's fainted he's fainted the Holy Ghost working on it it wasn't the age yet to know these things and why little Bethlehem he said it'd been better at the Methodist looked back to their old days their good old days when they were few and far between and little school houses and out here in America Fallen under the power of God throwing water in her face it'd be better for you Baptists look back where you come from too and the rest of you Pentecost will look back where you come from door in the door in um in 63 he said the methodists were like the Pentecostals has been a bunch of fanatics that lay in the school houses and fall out under the power of God and pour water on their face and don't tell me I've been right in the meetings see if they didn't just let them alone instead of bringing them back just let them gone on they would have been Pentecostals and how kind of overcome brother Bradham talks about this is the age of the personal life now I want to get this the age of the personal life is not just a restoration of the gift this is where the life comes not the gift the life but the life has the gifts don't don't forget the grain has everything in it don't call yourself grains and you say we don't believe in tongues and gifts of the Spirit and you're not grain you're back over here in the Baptist age you hadn't even Advanced as far as Azusa Street you're backslidden that far are you with me but this is the age of life personal life of Christ where you must have his life for he said we're living in the shadows and the Wrath is ready to strike and God is requiring a token that you yourself have received this token the Holy Ghost and it is the only way and the only sign that God will ever pass because it is the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back into the believer so this is it the literal life not a gift to the spirit I've explained before don't have a thing to give okay so if I give a gift to this microphone here brother Aaron you see that's a gift I gave him he has a gift in his hand that's from me I gave it to him but that's not me he can have that gift but he doesn't have me amen now one day at an altar I'm I and a pretty little girl came together and we stood at an altar and we made vows to each other and she gave her herself to me as a gift now the two of us became one there was no longer just one Tim Pruitt there were two of them there was Tim in the groom form and Tim and bride form for a long time you know she signed her they missed him Pruitt because she had taken on my name she was identified with me and the bride of Christ and Christ are one amen they are not one in the sense of one person they are one because Christ is in them amen so Christ comes into us as a gift so we receive not not a gift of the spirit that's charismata you know we're gifts of the Spirit tongues interpretations uh heal his faith those are gifts of the Spirit that's not the spirit that the gifts of the Spirit the spirit is Jesus Christ himself the life that was in him poured out at Calvary come back on the day of Pentecost and field 120 in the upper room and they received the personal life of Jesus Christ that's what the Holy Ghost is that's what it was then that's what it is today and when you receive the Holy Ghost you are receiving deity in your life now so he said it is the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back into the believer now the token message brother Branham told us now the blood that was shed at Calvary bathed on the ground we have the token of the blood which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost is to identify us as Believers so it is and let me just challenge you go back and listen to the Token message and when you do hear token seem like people get in it's almost makes it an oblivious term and so they just came over every time you see token say holy ghost because the token is the Holy Ghost and everywhere brother Branham is saying token he is talking about the Holy Ghost so he said he said now um the blood that was shedded cow were bathed on the ground now we have the token of the blood which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost to identify us as believers and these signs shall follow them that believe not just professors but identified believers they may not follow they probably will that perhaps they will Jesus said they shall follow them that believe just absolutely impossible for it not to happen the works that I do shall do also that's the identification Jesus identification was to manifest the word of God which he was and the church's identification today is to manifest the promised word of this day by The Same Spirit that was manifested and quickened the word then the Same Spirit quickens the word to the believer today and manifests the same thing showing that the token Holy Ghost is on this person which is a resurrected life of Jesus Christ Living in his believer oh that ought to accept the Church of fire and that's true just as true as it could be the water AIDS the blood age and now the token age of the Holy Ghost you know brother tell them sometimes I wish you'd just preached the message well the evening time message is to apply the token the Holy Ghost and the token is the Holy Ghost first under justification of water baptism second under the new birth of of Wesley sanctification which cleanses thirdly under the baptism of the Holy Spirit put it in that Sanctified vessels into service the word Sanctified means is a compound word which means cleaned and set aside for service set aside for service now the Holy Spirit puts it in service and we'll notice when the unclean spirit is coming from a man he walks in dry places that's exactly what the church has done Baptist methodists those who believe in sanctification then Jesus said the unclean spirit that went out returns back to this church body and finds the house garnished swept clean live Pure Living Pure Clean lives but if that house isn't filled and occupied when he comes in with seven other evil demons worse than he was and the last stage of this place is seven times worse than it was in the first place they've been better to stay Lutheran than it would be to receive that life and fail to follow so will the Pentecostals you know what I mean the house is garnished I was talking to somebody the other day said they're very careful many of these Holiness groups not to call the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost because they identify themselves with Pentecostals when they do that they say holy spirit seek to keep them saying Holy Ghost because the Pentecostal common people just call it what the Bible says holy ghost which Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost is the same thing but they're careful about it they don't want to be identified with them tongue-speaking people and that's the Holy Spirit itself see oh brother damn I wish you'd read us a quote after the seals that was after the seals what happened then when the enemy that went out under sanctification that was washed out and returned back and found the house not filled with the Holy Spirit he's talking about the church Methodist Nazarene and so on not filled with the Holy Spirit now the state of the church is joined with a league of churches worth World Council of churches it's an estate now that connects it to Roman Catholic Catholicism all the rest of it and now it's seven times worse than it was when it come out of Lutheranism brother L can tell you brother L can tell you that that's true that it's uh that it's seven times worse than what the Methodist today that when it came out of Luther seven times worse and the same thing the same thing happens with any of them when a house when a church is not filled with the spirit then they become seven times worse because all the sins of the past ages keep up into them until they are the rejecters of Jesus Christ in the laodicean age now brother Branham talks about this he says important that you get filled you've emptied out he said a man confess Christ as his savior got rid of his wickedness quit his drink and quit his smoke in his line and stealing becomes Sanctified and cleaned out his house was all swept he feels free he comes back and he found inside the house then he goes and gets seven other Spirits worse than he was and comes into this person the Bible said the last day to the man is worse than the first than it was at the beginning now what just happened an evangelists come through they preached repentance you clean up from your sins when you cleaned up the devil goes away from me you take back the things you stole you confess your wrongs your wife or your husband you really clean up and then the next thing of it is you're just clean and make a real good Target for the devil now after the people believed and were baptized they were filled with the Holy Spirit that's God's Divine program and when you're saved you might be filled with good thoughts and so forth are you but unless you are filled with God God sent the Holy Spirit to the Earth to motivate the church and you might be filled with thoughts you might be filled with theologies you might be filled with education I know it all and you might be filled with religion and still be a target of the devil thank you and you might be reading a Bible and you see where Jesus performed and done miracles and you take it to the pastor and he says oh now look we don't believe that he says we who's we who is we don't believe in him and who it isn't him and God God wrote it it's him and somebody else and if you're behind it it's the same motive that was at the Tower of Babel to build a man-made Earthly Dominion now so you see he said when the Holy Spirit comes the world becomes dead and you're filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the devil is a person that has to stay away from you you are under God's domain you are a new creature the Holy Spirit come to that empty vessel and filled it up so that's what every person ought to be now don't just come this far and say well I believe the message the devil believes it too that's only being able to read you can read that no it's true and say I believe it you must have the token the Holy Ghost the very Life of Christ must be in you now let me come down to an end because I want to just I just want to finish here on on this one quote we'll come around to it now brother Branham deals with what is sin because there are people that don't drink don't smoke would never tell you a lie that are sinners and I want you to hear what he said about Sin are you ready because if the Holy Ghost comes he's going to deliver you from sin all right listen question answers and he reads the scripture whosoever is born of God does not commit sin and he says what is sin and explains unbelief that's what the Bible said there's only one sin that's unbelief that's right he that believeth not is condemned already so one will sin now you say well wait a minute I believe they might have got the Holy Ghost like that in them days but I don't believe it's so but brother the Bible said to promise to you and your children I know but listen brother Branham you are sinning you are sitting right there you're disbelieving what God Said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever well now we're taught that he said I don't care what you're talking the Bible said let every man's word be alive might be true well principally he's the same you mean he's the same yeah in the church doing the same things he did with his ear well I can't believe that you are sinning you are sending he that's born of God of the Holy Ghost don't say those things and if he says he's got the Holy Ghost and says he'll say those things that's evidence he hasn't got it I don't care what he's done if you don't believe in Divine Healing he don't believe in the power the resurrection he don't believe in the Holy Ghost being poured out upon us just exactly like it did in the first stage just the same God yesterday today and forever the same things Apostles done happening how now speaking in tongues and rejoicing and all these other things that they don't believe that he's not born of God for whosoever is born of God does not commit those kinds of things that's how to tell whether they're born of God you walk up to a fellow and say p Dr pH so and so Reverend Dr so and so which is fine he said I wish I had it degrees but is it so Divine Healing should be carried on the church just like it was the apostles did oh no no no no he's sinning he's an unbeliever that's right you say Do you believe we receive the Holy Ghost like they did here I was reading over here in the in the Bible in Acts 2 where it said the the there were and poured out the Holy Ghost and they started like they were drunk and they went out and talked in the languages of those people and things like that and I said like people are drunk and the church thought they were drunk and we received when we received the Holy Ghost today in the Baptist Church of our baptism Methodist Presbyterian whatever it may be I don't see us doing that well I tell you a child that was just for them 12. he is a sinning he is not born of the spirit of God because the Bible said he that's born of the spirit of God does not disbelieve he is a Believer and he cannot why why oh here it is the dove is leading for the spirit of God is in him and he cannot deny it he cannot it's the spirit of God and God won't deny his own word if I deny my own word then I become a liar and if you say you got the spirit of God and deny the word of God it's either God's a liar are you a liar one or the other and the Bible said let every man's word be alive might be the truth and a man that's born of the spirit of God cannot disagree with God's word he's got to say it is right he can't do nothing else this is it this is the truth so he said let me read it again whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for the seed what is the seed of God the promise Abraham had the seed what is the seed now Christ is Christ the seed of God whose seed is he if he if he isn't all right he is the seated God the seed of God remaineth in him the Holy Ghost comes abide not from meeting the meeting but for Eternal and if you want to put that down in your scripture this Ephesians 4 30 greed not the holy spirit of God we're by your seal to the day of redemption the seed of God remains in him and he cannot sin because he's born of God he can't disbelieve God's word and when you see a man disagreeing with God's word and saying all that was for another age when the promises to whosoever will let him come remember he is an unbeliever and not a god you see nicolaitan take it The Experience from the people and have something administered only by the preacher believe my Doctrine then you got it believe what I'm preaching my Revelation then you got it believe believe me you know join the church just get baptized you got it nicolaitanism but we're in the hour of restoration Hallelujah amen for God said I will restore saith the Lord Sarah I don't care how long you've disbelieved I don't care how long you've given up on the promise I don't care how much bitterness you sit in your tent I'm not leaving you in that tent in your unbelief I'm calling you out by the word of God and there's going to be a renewing in you a rebellion of the Holy Ghost and the rebellion of his spirit and if I were you I would get ready to receive it and I would say being unto me according to Thy Word Hallelujah that's where it ought to be amen that's the way we ought to look at it this is the hour where the promise is restored the promise is unto you Hallelujah to you to you to you to you to you to your children to them that are far off I don't care how far they see I don't care how much a prodigal they are the promises are you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as we learn our God shall call and he's still calling and the problem sister are yours praise the
