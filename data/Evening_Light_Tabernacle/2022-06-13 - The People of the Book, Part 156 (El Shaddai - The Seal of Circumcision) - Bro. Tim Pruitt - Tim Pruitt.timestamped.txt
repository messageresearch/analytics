[56:29] you will just meet with them in a
[56:30] special way today
[56:32] may it be that your anointing just

[56:36] lord the understanding and the
[56:37] enlightenment of the word becomes real
[56:39] to them
[56:40] ever need supply we pray
[56:43] in the name of jesus we ask it
[56:46] amen
[56:47] amen god bless you
[56:49] turn with me to genesis 17 and we'll
[56:51] read from the first to the third verses
[56:54] then we'll skip down to verse seven
[56:57] so genesis 1-3
[57:00] and when abram was 90 years old and nine
[57:03] the lord appeared to abram and said unto
[57:05] him i am the almighty god
[57:07] walk before me and be thou perfect
[57:10] and i will make my covenant between me
[57:12] and thee
[57:13] and will multiply thee exceedingly and
[57:17] abram fell on his face and god talked
[57:19] with him saying now drop down to verse 7
[57:22] now and as we're reading this i want you
[57:24] to think these things were written in
[57:26] the scripture for our examples
[57:29] amen so that we through comfort and hope
[57:32] of the scripture
[57:34] might have find our hope in them so
[57:37] there again verse 7 and i will establish
[57:40] my covenant between me and thee and thy
[57:43] seed after thee and their generations
[57:45] for an everlasting covenant to be a god
[57:47] unto thee and to thy seed after thee and
[57:51] i will give unto thee and to that seed
[57:53] after thee the land were in thou art a
[57:55] stranger all the land of canaan for an
[57:59] everlasting possession and i will be
[58:02] their god
[58:03] amen do you know what that means to us
[58:06] that means everything that's in our
[58:08] canaan which is the holy ghost
[58:10] he has given to us
[58:13] everything it is a an everlasting
[58:16] possession
[58:17] and he will be our god and god said to
[58:21] abraham thou shalt keep my covenant
[58:23] therefore
[58:24] thou and thy seed after thee and their
[58:27] generations and this is my covenant
[58:30] which ye shall keep between me and you
[58:33] and thy seed after thee
[58:35] and
[58:36] he goes off and he says thou shalt not
[58:38] kill and thou shalt not steal and thou
[58:40] shalt not bear false witness and thou
[58:42] shalt not commit adultery is that the
[58:45] covenant he's making
[58:46] no here's the covenant he makes with the
[58:48] seed of abraham
[58:50] here's what he does every man child
[58:53] among you shall be circumcised
[58:57] this is my covenant i'm going to make
[58:59] with you
[59:02] every child must be circumcised
[59:06] and ye shall circumcise the flesh of
[59:08] your foreskin and it shall be
[59:10] a token or the sign of the covenant so
[59:13] the circumcision is going to be the sign
[59:16] of the covenant the cutting off of the
[59:18] flesh
[59:20] is going to be the sign that you are in
[59:22] covenant with god
[59:24] amen
[59:25] and and he that is eight days old
[59:28] um
[59:29] and shall be circumcised among you a man
[59:32] every man child in your generation he
[59:34] that's born in the house are bought with
[59:37] money of any stranger which is not of
[59:39] thy seed
[59:41] and he that is born in that house and he
[59:44] that is bought with thy money must be
[59:46] circumcised
[59:48] my covenant shall be in your flesh for
[59:50] an everlasting covenant
[59:52] and the uncircumcised man-child whose
[59:54] flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised
[59:58] that soul
[1:00:00] shall be cut off from his people
[1:00:03] he hath broken my covenant
[1:00:08] but my covenant verse 21
[1:00:11] my covenant will i establish with isaac
[1:00:14] which sarah shall bear unto thee at the
[1:00:16] set time in the next year and he left
[1:00:19] off talking with him and god went up
[1:00:21] from abraham
[1:00:23] just to
[1:00:24] just so we can be rested together mark
[1:00:27] 16 verse 14. just gonna have you stand
[1:00:30] as i read this one still
[1:00:32] afterwards he abraded he appeared unto
[1:00:35] the eleven as they sat at mead and
[1:00:37] upgraded them with their unbelief and
[1:00:40] hardness of heart because they believed
[1:00:43] not them that had seen him after he was
[1:00:45] risen
[1:00:46] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[1:00:48] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:00:50] creature
[1:00:52] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:00:54] be saved that he that believeth not
[1:00:55] shall be damned and these signs shall
[1:00:58] follow them that believe in my name they
[1:01:00] shall cast out devils they shall speak
[1:01:02] with new tongues they shall take up
[1:01:04] serpents and if they drink any deadly
[1:01:06] thing
[1:01:07] it shall not hurt them they shall lay
[1:01:09] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:01:12] and so then after the lord had spoken
[1:01:14] unto them he was received up into heaven
[1:01:16] and sat on the right hand of god
[1:01:18] and they went forth and preached
[1:01:20] everywhere the lord working with them
[1:01:22] and confirming the word with signs
[1:01:25] following
[1:01:26] amen god bless you can be seated
[1:01:30] of course that should be said of every
[1:01:32] believe in church
[1:01:33] and they went forth and preached
[1:01:34] everywhere the lord working with them
[1:01:37] and confirming the word with signs
[1:01:39] following
[1:01:40] i think it's very important that we
[1:01:43] as a people who
[1:01:46] are in the unfolding of the last day
[1:01:49] events by the opening of the seventh
[1:01:52] seal
[1:01:53] which brings us into the the phases of
[1:01:56] his coming as it not it's not a singular
[1:01:59] event but a multitude of events winding
[1:02:02] up the end time processes
[1:02:05] and i think it's very important that we
[1:02:06] realize that it is to those who have
[1:02:09] received
[1:02:11] the breaking of the silence the
[1:02:12] revealing of the word
[1:02:14] that we have received the uh the again
[1:02:18] this admonition to fulfill and finish
[1:02:22] the great commission
[1:02:24] brother branham would tell us this an
[1:02:25] invisible union of the bride it's very
[1:02:28] striking
[1:02:29] where he talks about this uh he talks
[1:02:31] about the seventh um about the seven
[1:02:35] seals being opened and he said this is
[1:02:37] why the denominations cannot fulfill or
[1:02:40] finish the great commission
[1:02:42] because they can't even agree on just
[1:02:44] one or two of the words
[1:02:46] much less the entire word of god
[1:02:49] and so it is those who receive of the
[1:02:52] entire word that have the the um the
[1:02:55] duty then to fulfill and finish the
[1:02:58] great commission
[1:03:00] now we have been 2 000 years and yet the
[1:03:03] gospel is not went into the into all the
[1:03:06] world yet
[1:03:07] and we are right now of course um
[1:03:11] a people that are
[1:03:13] uh
[1:03:14] have went beyond borders beyond the
[1:03:18] um between between the boundaries that
[1:03:21] men set up of countries and communist
[1:03:24] countries and and um
[1:03:26] you know all types of countries where
[1:03:28] that
[1:03:29] they had they had boundaries that were
[1:03:32] set up where that the gospel could not
[1:03:34] get in
[1:03:35] but we are people that are breaching all
[1:03:37] of those and the gospel will reach every
[1:03:41] predestinated seed
[1:03:43] now it's not it's so important that
[1:03:46] every person hears it but that the seed
[1:03:48] of god hears it
[1:03:51] and because god has an elect
[1:03:54] now so again you know we the gospel must
[1:03:57] be preached everywhere the lord working
[1:03:59] with us and confirming the words
[1:04:02] following with signs following so yeah
[1:04:05] i'm hammering at this just like noah did
[1:04:08] in his day
[1:04:10] preparing the ark for his salvation now
[1:04:12] we we preach a lot of times as it was in
[1:04:15] the days of noah
[1:04:17] and we say okay well they're married and
[1:04:19] given in marriage and and they're um
[1:04:22] there's marriage and divorce and
[1:04:23] remarriage and the buying and selling
[1:04:25] and trading and they're building cities
[1:04:27] and and going on like everything is is
[1:04:30] going to last forever
[1:04:32] but forget don't forget there's another
[1:04:35] part to the days of noah and that is a
[1:04:37] people
[1:04:38] in the last day that are hammering on an
[1:04:41] ark
[1:04:42] that are
[1:04:43] making a way through this perilous times
[1:04:47] that we're in
[1:04:49] and a people that are going to make it
[1:04:50] to the other side
[1:04:52] so we are like it was at noah's junction
[1:04:55] noah could say there's water coming from
[1:04:58] the sky
[1:04:59] there's going to be so much of it that
[1:05:01] it will float an ark that would be full
[1:05:03] of life
[1:05:04] and it but it would take the omnipotence
[1:05:07] of god to do it but you see
[1:05:09] and god had pro
[1:05:12] exactly perfect instructions on how it
[1:05:16] was to be built
[1:05:17] how the way prepared to to make that
[1:05:21] escape of the things that was coming on
[1:05:23] the earth and i want you to remember
[1:05:25] this is the same thing that we're also
[1:05:28] building an ark we're building a way of
[1:05:31] escape
[1:05:32] and that way of escape is a rapture for
[1:05:34] us it's not a flood that's coming it's a
[1:05:36] fire that's going to fall but there's a
[1:05:38] people going to leave here by the fire
[1:05:41] before the fire falls
[1:05:43] so you see noah was preparing an ark he
[1:05:46] was making a place of safety and that
[1:05:49] was a miracle all of his own of course
[1:05:52] you know there there had to be some
[1:05:54] signs in that would follow them that
[1:05:56] believed there had to be an effect that
[1:05:58] would take place
[1:06:00] and and not only would it gather the
[1:06:02] elect of the people of that day but in
[1:06:05] that time the supernatural would go out
[1:06:07] and gather all the animals into the ark
[1:06:10] amen you you see there was a whole
[1:06:13] moving of the spirit of god as things
[1:06:15] were happening and the omnipotence of
[1:06:17] god was being shown at that junction
[1:06:20] and and so
[1:06:22] he was preaching there was there is a
[1:06:24] water coming out of the skies well it
[1:06:26] never rained well it's different from us
[1:06:28] we're saying there's fire going to fall
[1:06:30] and there's already been fire f fallen
[1:06:34] right
[1:06:34] hiroshima would vanish in just a moment
[1:06:37] and nagasaki and different other places
[1:06:40] we've seen what the fire can do
[1:06:42] and russia has got you know three three
[1:06:45] uh uh networks of bombs that they have
[1:06:48] got for america when they hit the east
[1:06:50] coast one hit the west coast and then
[1:06:52] other
[1:06:53] with um with our government uh central
[1:06:56] place and they say this they call it
[1:06:59] satan
[1:07:00] and these satan bombs will just unleash
[1:07:03] just thousands of warheads at a time
[1:07:06] and wipe out the whole country at a time
[1:07:09] brother branham told us they got our
[1:07:11] name on it
[1:07:13] they call it satan
[1:07:15] we have turned
[1:07:16] from the lamb
[1:07:18] to speak as a dragon
[1:07:21] now so you see but but by faith you know
[1:07:24] noah was warned of god and he prepared
[1:07:27] an ark now that's what we're trying to
[1:07:28] do is prepare a people for the coming of
[1:07:32] the lord so no matter how foolish it
[1:07:35] might have been and seem and how
[1:07:37] fanatical it might be you see it's a
[1:07:40] miracle to see a people in this day
[1:07:43] hammering away at something that seems
[1:07:46] just
[1:07:47] impossible or ridiculous you know to to
[1:07:50] really go in a rapture to be changed in
[1:07:53] a moment in a twinkling of an eye you
[1:07:56] see but all of that is repeating again
[1:07:58] just as noah was calling for rain it
[1:08:01] repeats again when men are pounding the
[1:08:04] gospel of the lord jesus christ
[1:08:06] preaching the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:08:09] and getting a people ready for the
[1:08:12] coming judgment
[1:08:13] preparing a shield from that
[1:08:17] amen may and while all this is going on
[1:08:20] modern churches laughing you know all
[1:08:23] the rebellion against the word of god
[1:08:25] that is going on and on and on and on
[1:08:27] today
[1:08:28] and the church is laboring under the
[1:08:31] preaching of the gospel with signs and
[1:08:34] wonders why because they are preparing
[1:08:37] for a miracle
[1:08:39] and i just want to say this is exactly
[1:08:41] what god is doing right now he is
[1:08:44] preparing a people for a miracle
[1:08:47] every sign every healing every
[1:08:49] deliverance everything is preparing
[1:08:51] hearts for a miracle
[1:08:53] and that miracle of course will be the
[1:08:56] rapture of the church that changed in a
[1:08:59] moment in a twinkling of an eye think
[1:09:01] about it a day of gone by they didn't
[1:09:04] even know what rain meant it never
[1:09:06] rained and yet 2 000 years ago you know
[1:09:10] um after god's preaching the gospel now
[1:09:13] for 2 000 years people don't know what
[1:09:15] it means to be born again or the spirit
[1:09:18] of god they don't know what omnipotence
[1:09:20] means they don't know god's omnipotent
[1:09:22] power that can transform a soul from a
[1:09:26] street center to an angelic position in
[1:09:29] the kingdom of god as a son or daughter
[1:09:32] of god amen they don't understand it
[1:09:35] they're too
[1:09:36] infatuated with the things of the world
[1:09:38] they're still flirting and don't realize
[1:09:41] that that's an evil spirit and a great
[1:09:43] signpost for the people of this day to
[1:09:46] watch and be ready our we are a signpost
[1:09:50] because we are declaring god's
[1:09:53] omnipotent power
[1:09:54] in this great time of darkness
[1:09:57] now we've been speaking on el shaddai
[1:10:00] but that was at a junction and we are at
[1:10:02] that same junction
[1:10:04] this is a time of the pouring out of the
[1:10:06] almighty the pouring out of the spirit
[1:10:08] of god
[1:10:10] you know it was a time when god's
[1:10:11] omnipotence was shown and we are at a
[1:10:14] junction where the holy ghost that has
[1:10:17] worked by portion through justification
[1:10:19] and sanctification and baptism of the
[1:10:22] spirit but is but
[1:10:24] but he's now here as almighty god in
[1:10:28] full omnipotence
[1:10:31] in the full power of the holy ghost
[1:10:34] now so as we as we know el shaddai means
[1:10:38] it comes from the word breast like a
[1:10:40] woman abraham i'm coming to you in the
[1:10:42] name of the breasted one the nurse the
[1:10:46] life-giver like when a little baby is
[1:10:48] sick
[1:10:49] and the mother holds that that child to
[1:10:52] its breast and she nurses if it's
[1:10:55] fretting and crying and it just lays
[1:10:58] there and nurses and and gets strong
[1:11:02] right amen so where's this nursing his
[1:11:05] life from it's nursing from its mother
[1:11:07] and god appears to us as el shaddai the
[1:11:10] breasted one both of them the old and
[1:11:13] the new testament
[1:11:15] just full of promises
[1:11:17] full of the vitamins of the word
[1:11:19] not just one breast but two breasts amen
[1:11:22] why he died for a compound reason amen
[1:11:26] he was wounded by transgressions
[1:11:29] and with his stripes he provided a way
[1:11:31] for our healing that's one breath and
[1:11:33] one for our salvation one for our
[1:11:36] healing
[1:11:37] amen i'm the breast of god i have two
[1:11:39] witnesses in the mouth of two or three
[1:11:42] witnesses let everywhere be established
[1:11:45] so in the old testament he would be
[1:11:46] known as jehovah or alpha jehovah jireh
[1:11:49] the lord did he let the jehovah
[1:11:52] in the old testament that the different
[1:11:54] compound names of him but in the new
[1:11:57] testament he would be known by one name
[1:12:00] amen by one name his name would be one
[1:12:04] and in that name and only in that name
[1:12:06] would there be salvation there would not
[1:12:08] be deliverance in the name of el
[1:12:11] salvador
[1:12:12] or elohim or or the only way of
[1:12:15] salvation would be to recognize that all
[1:12:18] of them was encapsulated
[1:12:20] in jesus christ and that jesus christ
[1:12:23] was a man that else said i
[1:12:26] am that else said i became jesus christ
[1:12:30] that elohim became jesus christ that
[1:12:33] melchizedek became jesus christ and all
[1:12:36] the fullness of god was wrapped up into
[1:12:38] that one
[1:12:43] and contrary to some of these some of
[1:12:45] these liars today
[1:12:47] that think that oh one day the body of
[1:12:50] jesus christ would just become like
[1:12:52] another man and
[1:12:53] and no that will he will be there
[1:12:56] throughout eternity the only visible
[1:12:59] form of god
[1:13:01] will be in jesus christ
[1:13:05] now
[1:13:07] so we can take the old testament
[1:13:10] we can go back there and we can draw
[1:13:12] strength from it
[1:13:14] we can go the new testament and we can
[1:13:16] draw strength from it
[1:13:18] amen and then that in that drawing
[1:13:21] strength you know we can have strength
[1:13:23] for our healing or strength for our
[1:13:26] salvation it doesn't matter what the
[1:13:29] need is it's all
[1:13:30] encapsulated in him
[1:13:33] amen it's all lays right there in the
[1:13:36] word and that's why we always try to get
[1:13:39] your faith not to lie in man
[1:13:42] but in the word of god because it's the
[1:13:45] word of god that never fails
[1:13:48] are you with me
[1:13:49] amen so you know
[1:13:51] in this type we're all kind of like
[1:13:53] bottle babies
[1:13:55] amen god provided two bottles old and
[1:13:58] new testament
[1:14:00] amen we got spiritual vitamins in it
[1:14:03] there there's calcium for the bones b
[1:14:06] vitamins for the complex there for the
[1:14:08] for the nerves
[1:14:10] if you're nervous
[1:14:12] if you're full of anxiety
[1:14:14] hey man there's plenty of things in here
[1:14:16] to calm it
[1:14:19] hey man if you're weak and your bones
[1:14:21] are weak there's plenty of calcium in
[1:14:23] this word
[1:14:25] to give you strength for the journey
[1:14:28] it doesn't matter what your need is you
[1:14:31] can draw it from the word of god
[1:14:33] amen and it's up to date it's for right
[1:14:36] now it's for this moment
[1:14:40] now god would say
[1:14:42] to abraham you're going to have a
[1:14:44] promised son
[1:14:46] so how am i going to bring it how is it
[1:14:47] sarah is this 2 000 year old new
[1:14:50] testament bride is going to how is it
[1:14:52] she's going to finally bring forth the
[1:14:54] promised son how is he going to bring
[1:14:56] jesus back to earth again
[1:14:58] we've been looking for it a long time
[1:15:04] and to a large degree many have given up
[1:15:06] on it
[1:15:09] and you know
[1:15:11] how are they how are they going to bring
[1:15:13] forth it
[1:15:14] they are going to do it by receiving
[1:15:17] receiving el shaddai
[1:15:19] and nursing from him
[1:15:22] and so how are we going to do it we're
[1:15:24] going to do it the same way else that i
[1:15:26] represents the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:15:29] it is christ in the full power of his
[1:15:34] word
[1:15:35] amen to do this god will require a
[1:15:38] covenant and that covenant will be the
[1:15:40] sign of circumcision
[1:15:43] are you with me now that's why we're
[1:15:45] speaking this morning on the seal of
[1:15:47] circumcision
[1:15:49] the seal that sign of circumcision
[1:15:52] is the cutting off of the flesh
[1:15:55] in the secret parts
[1:16:00] now
[1:16:01] you see
[1:16:03] you see it isn't about laws of do's and
[1:16:06] don'ts it's about changing the heart
[1:16:11] you know a lot of people say well it
[1:16:13] don't matter what's on the outside it's
[1:16:15] what's on the inside and the inside is
[1:16:17] what is important that must be changed
[1:16:20] but you get the inside fixed
[1:16:24] and it will control the outside
[1:16:27] amen
[1:16:29] amen now you see
[1:16:31] again the sign of the circumcision is
[1:16:34] the cutting off of the flesh in the
[1:16:36] secret parts that was the old testament
[1:16:38] covenant the new it is the cutting off
[1:16:41] of the flesh in the secret part
[1:16:45] of the heart
[1:16:48] because our heart
[1:16:50] is being claimed by god
[1:16:54] and it belongs to him
[1:16:56] and all the issue from the heart
[1:16:59] belongs to him and thus our life belongs
[1:17:02] to him
[1:17:03] god says if i can get their heart
[1:17:06] i'll have the rest of them
[1:17:11] amen that's what god wants remember
[1:17:14] you know he told them about laws and
[1:17:16] this and that the other and thou shalt
[1:17:17] not because they ask what can we do so
[1:17:20] he gave him a bunch of things to do and
[1:17:22] but then he then he expressed his desire
[1:17:25] oh
[1:17:26] that my people would just love me
[1:17:30] with all of their heart with all of
[1:17:32] their soul
[1:17:34] with all their being that's what i want
[1:17:36] i want to be loved
[1:17:39] from the heart
[1:17:42] i'm not so interested in you loving me
[1:17:44] because you'll i'll save you from hell
[1:17:48] i want you to love me for who i am
[1:17:53] now so among the pharisees there was
[1:17:56] always this um
[1:17:59] there was always much concern as the
[1:18:01] strict keepers of the law about the
[1:18:04] outward cleansing of the hands remember
[1:18:06] they would go around complaining about
[1:18:08] the disciples they didn't wash their
[1:18:10] hands before they ate and they didn't do
[1:18:12] these certain ceremonial things and you
[1:18:14] know we we do that because we're more
[1:18:16] holy that way
[1:18:19] and and jesus was more concerned about
[1:18:23] the condition of the heart
[1:18:25] than the condition of the of their hands
[1:18:29] you see
[1:18:30] it was always law do this and don't do
[1:18:33] that it was never a love affair
[1:18:38] it was never done out of love it was
[1:18:41] always done out of this is what i have
[1:18:44] to do
[1:18:46] you see a bomb's woman like hagar she
[1:18:51] never had a love affair
[1:18:54] with abraham
[1:18:57] a bonds woman never serves out of love
[1:19:01] they do it because they are forced to do
[1:19:04] it
[1:19:05] you see they are born bombs woman and
[1:19:08] they are they are told
[1:19:10] that's what you have to do
[1:19:13] because they're slaves
[1:19:15] now you see there's been too many slaves
[1:19:19] in christianity
[1:19:21] god is not marrying a slave woman he's
[1:19:24] marrying a free woman
[1:19:26] do you understand you know that when you
[1:19:28] see you see many years ago they would
[1:19:31] they were there was slaves sold and they
[1:19:33] would go and swap slaves and and and
[1:19:36] brother branham said of that he said
[1:19:38] that's what many of you are right now
[1:19:41] is a slave
[1:19:43] many of you through the city and through
[1:19:44] the country are nothing but church
[1:19:47] slaves
[1:19:50] nothing but slaves to christianity when
[1:19:53] you should be free
[1:19:58] you see god wants more than a
[1:20:00] denominational christian
[1:20:02] who just has a form of godliness
[1:20:05] and lacks the power
[1:20:08] you see it's more about receiving the
[1:20:11] power than it is receiving the dress
[1:20:14] code
[1:20:17] amen it's it's more you see god wants
[1:20:20] children of the supernatural not
[1:20:23] children of the slave woman
[1:20:26] that's what god wants he wants those
[1:20:28] that are born again my children are
[1:20:31] people who love me
[1:20:33] who call me father
[1:20:36] amen a people who know their god so they
[1:20:39] can do exploits because they're not
[1:20:41] slaves
[1:20:43] a slave doesn't worry about all the
[1:20:45] other things around there he just to
[1:20:47] slay it it is the three children
[1:20:50] that says this is our land
[1:20:53] this is our country this is our promise
[1:20:56] this is our boundaries this belongs to
[1:20:59] us because we are the free people
[1:21:02] it don't belong to slaves
[1:21:05] i want to get something to you every
[1:21:07] promise in this bible belongs to you
[1:21:10] it does not belong to slaves we have to
[1:21:13] get rid of our slave mentality and
[1:21:16] realize we are now the children of the
[1:21:18] most high god
[1:21:20] and every promise of the word belongs to
[1:21:22] us
[1:21:25] now
[1:21:26] true
[1:21:27] the seed of the word you can give the
[1:21:30] word of god
[1:21:32] portions of the word of god to a bonds
[1:21:35] woman
[1:21:36] but it'll only produce an ishmaelite a
[1:21:38] wild man
[1:21:41] you can put promises of the word of god
[1:21:44] in a bonds woman and it'll bring forth
[1:21:47] life
[1:21:51] but what kind of life
[1:21:53] is
[1:21:55] ishmael meal
[1:21:55] never give the word of god preeminence
[1:21:58] and god had to bring an isaac that would
[1:22:01] bring the give the word preeminence
[1:22:04] there would be a difference between the
[1:22:06] two one would be a gentle man yielding
[1:22:08] to god obeying god fell
[1:22:11] led by god the other would be a wild man
[1:22:15] but i'm seated of abraham i'm a
[1:22:17] christian and i can live like this
[1:22:21] you see because they won't be subject to
[1:22:23] the word of god because why they are it
[1:22:26] brings forth wild seed
[1:22:29] now the constant upholding of the word
[1:22:32] of god is what people don't understand
[1:22:34] so when you watch the life of abraham it
[1:22:36] was the constant unfolding of god they
[1:22:38] even get confused on the deity of god
[1:22:40] and first thing you know you've got
[1:22:42] multiple deities you've got elohim and
[1:22:44] el shaddai and the almighty and then you
[1:22:47] have
[1:22:48] jehovah rapha and
[1:22:49] all the different forms of rapha or
[1:22:52] jehovah i mean and all of that next
[1:22:54] thing you know you got many gods
[1:23:00] because why it was just god unfolding
[1:23:02] itself
[1:23:03] the same god all the time
[1:23:06] now
[1:23:07] so we many times
[1:23:10] people don't understand the unfolding of
[1:23:12] god and the question comes like through
[1:23:15] abraham how could god give me ishmael
[1:23:18] and yet he's not the one
[1:23:21] how could it be the spirit you know that
[1:23:23] god allowed me to have this son and yet
[1:23:26] he's not the one he's making covenant
[1:23:29] with
[1:23:30] you see you see it was where it was
[1:23:33] times where where that was where god was
[1:23:37] not where god is
[1:23:40] you see luther was where god once was
[1:23:43] and god blessed him
[1:23:45] and he brought forth a bunch of wild
[1:23:47] lutherans
[1:23:49] and wesley is where god was
[1:23:53] amen god blessed him and he brought
[1:23:55] forth a bunch of wild methodists
[1:23:58] i don't know if you've been watching
[1:24:00] them in the news here or listening about
[1:24:01] them in the news
[1:24:03] but there the methodist church there is
[1:24:05] is um you know is actually there's a
[1:24:08] split going on within their denomination
[1:24:12] because a whole group of them are
[1:24:14] accepting the homosexual community which
[1:24:16] by the way some of you have asked me
[1:24:18] what the h word was that's the h word
[1:24:22] that you're not supposed to say anymore
[1:24:24] from the pulpit
[1:24:26] but anyway you know they they have this
[1:24:27] whole movement that is going on where
[1:24:30] you know
[1:24:31] with wesley why because
[1:24:33] they brought forth a bunch of wild
[1:24:36] children
[1:24:38] who will not be subject to the bible not
[1:24:42] even on basic things
[1:24:45] not even on righteous living
[1:24:50] you see
[1:24:51] and again the azusa street revival was
[1:24:53] where god was and
[1:24:55] and and
[1:24:57] and and so
[1:24:58] but again it brought forth a bunch of
[1:25:00] wild seed
[1:25:03] that wouldn't be subject to the word of
[1:25:04] god that would take his gifts that will
[1:25:07] take his prophecies they'll take his
[1:25:08] tongues they'll take his interpretations
[1:25:10] they'll take manifestations but they
[1:25:12] don't want him
[1:25:14] they won't give him preeminence
[1:25:18] so you know again now god has revealed
[1:25:21] himself in word form coming to a prophet
[1:25:25] that's actually what you see
[1:25:27] of that mighty one coming down in
[1:25:29] revelation 10 that is the word coming to
[1:25:32] a prophet it is christ
[1:25:35] coming in word form to a prophet but
[1:25:37] but now we're at another junction
[1:25:40] we're a junction where it changes from
[1:25:42] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:25:44] angel and now that voice is finished and
[1:25:47] he has sounded his message as the lord
[1:25:50] descends he progresses from the shout to
[1:25:54] the voice
[1:25:56] the voice of the resurrected ones
[1:25:59] now
[1:26:00] and so william so many stopped in
[1:26:02] revelation 10 7 you know that's good
[1:26:04] that's wonderful and it still is
[1:26:06] wonderful but what about the rest
[1:26:10] god continues moving on he continues
[1:26:12] unfolding himself
[1:26:15] you see revelation 10 8 and the voice
[1:26:17] which i heard from heaven speak to me
[1:26:19] again go and take the little book which
[1:26:22] is open it was close to revelation 5
[1:26:25] open in revelation 10 what happened a
[1:26:28] messenger came and the and the mysteries
[1:26:31] was revealed him god opened the seven
[1:26:33] seals
[1:26:34] and took the seals off the book
[1:26:37] providing us an open book
[1:26:40] amen where the whole bible is open to us
[1:26:44] from genesis to revelation
[1:26:47] and it all becomes pertinent
[1:26:51] come on and we are going to give it
[1:26:54] preeminence
[1:26:56] because there's got to be a people in
[1:26:57] this day who give that word preeminence
[1:27:02] now so again you see he said go take the
[1:27:05] little book and which is open in the
[1:27:07] hand of the angel which standeth upon
[1:27:10] the sea and upon the earth and then he
[1:27:12] commands him to eat the book
[1:27:14] amen now
[1:27:16] you see
[1:27:17] this was not wrote to some apostle
[1:27:20] coleman this does not
[1:27:22] this does not represent teacher veil
[1:27:25] john here is typing the bride
[1:27:28] this is you in the bible
[1:27:30] and she goes to the angel and says give
[1:27:32] me the little book verse nine
[1:27:34] and he said take it and eat it up
[1:27:37] there's some people there's some people
[1:27:39] that are saying give me
[1:27:41] every promise in that word
[1:27:44] i don't care what it is if it's healing
[1:27:46] i want it
[1:27:47] if it's against the spirit i want it if
[1:27:50] it's the dynamics i want it if it's the
[1:27:52] mechanics i want it if it's baptism in
[1:27:55] jesus name i want it if it's one god i
[1:27:58] want it everything that's in that bible
[1:28:00] i want it
[1:28:02] i'm going to give that word preeminence
[1:28:07] because i'm not a slave
[1:28:09] and a slave now
[1:28:11] as a wife she will give him total
[1:28:14] preeminence out of love the others out
[1:28:17] of duty
[1:28:21] why do we want to eat it
[1:28:23] the word the message must become flesh
[1:28:27] you see else had i was the breasted god
[1:28:30] eat of me i'm your sustainer i'm the
[1:28:31] giver of life
[1:28:33] and when eating and digested then it
[1:28:35] becomes a voice thou must prophesy again
[1:28:38] verse 11
[1:28:39] and he said to me thou must prophesy
[1:28:41] again before many peoples and nations
[1:28:44] and tongues and kings
[1:28:47] amen so again there must be a final
[1:28:49] voice a bride who's under her messenger
[1:28:53] becomes the final voice to the final age
[1:28:57] but you know we have received the word
[1:28:59] brother tim the message and that all
[1:29:01] there is
[1:29:02] just to receive the message
[1:29:05] isn't that the climax
[1:29:07] you can't go any further than the word
[1:29:09] can you why not just the word brother
[1:29:11] tim the word don't we receive the holy
[1:29:14] ghost when when we receive the word
[1:29:17] well let me just say
[1:29:18] it's got to be more than word in a book
[1:29:21] form
[1:29:22] the word has to become flesh
[1:29:26] it has to produce
[1:29:28] a people of the supernatural
[1:29:31] you see it must say
[1:29:33] the lord god omnipotent reigneth
[1:29:36] the lord is in full power
[1:29:39] full control of this people
[1:29:42] amen he must be displayed in his
[1:29:44] fullness in all that he is
[1:29:47] why because it's not complete until it's
[1:29:50] made flesh
[1:29:52] and all the word manifests in itself in
[1:29:55] bright form
[1:29:57] now as we look at this
[1:30:00] i want to just remind you of this
[1:30:01] quotation brother branham said as soon
[1:30:04] as he can get his church in speaking
[1:30:06] conditions
[1:30:10] where the word comes on your lips
[1:30:14] when he gets his word in his church and
[1:30:16] speaking conditions he gets his church
[1:30:18] to a place he can flow himself through
[1:30:21] and love and persuade and fellowship
[1:30:24] then there will come an eaten
[1:30:26] how many likes to eden to come
[1:30:29] amen he'll take the church back where it
[1:30:32] left him at back to an eden again where
[1:30:36] there where it fell god's going to bring
[1:30:39] a people back to eden
[1:30:42] but it will be as soon as he can get his
[1:30:45] people
[1:30:46] in unison with the word and saying what
[1:30:50] the word said
[1:30:52] agreeing with the word and applying that
[1:30:56] word
[1:30:57] you see you can never be healed until
[1:31:00] you agree the bible's true and that
[1:31:02] jesus died for you and he paid for your
[1:31:05] healing and you confess it is yours
[1:31:10] you see you can never be saved unless
[1:31:12] you first realize you first realize that
[1:31:15] he that cometh to god must believe that
[1:31:18] he is
[1:31:19] as long as you're wondering whether god
[1:31:21] exists or not you can never be saved
[1:31:24] you must believe he is and that he will
[1:31:27] reward those that diligently seek him so
[1:31:30] therefore you never give up
[1:31:32] you keep pressing in you keep seeking
[1:31:35] and seeking until you are rewarded
[1:31:40] because you believe he's going to reward
[1:31:42] you
[1:31:44] you have to believe the promise is yours
[1:31:47] now only el shaddai can take us back to
[1:31:50] eden almighty god only he can do that
[1:31:53] a true baptism of the holy ghost is the
[1:31:56] only thing that will produce a bride
[1:32:03] without the holy ghost this morning you
[1:32:05] may be potential bride but you're not
[1:32:07] bride
[1:32:10] until you enter into covenant
[1:32:13] you might be engaged and committed and
[1:32:18] say i got a ring of predestinated
[1:32:20] unmerited grace brother damn i'm called
[1:32:22] before the foundation but until you get
[1:32:25] that seal of circumcision
[1:32:28] until you are enter into covenant with
[1:32:30] him
[1:32:31] until you receive his life into you
[1:32:35] you are not yet bride
[1:32:40] now
[1:32:41] you see only a true baptism of the holy
[1:32:44] ghost can do this because you see sarah
[1:32:46] was 90 abraham was a hundred god would
[1:32:49] have to restore their bodies
[1:32:51] he'd have to heal sarah for bareness he
[1:32:54] would he would portray and use their
[1:32:56] voices as a voice of prophecy
[1:32:59] of what he would do at the end time
[1:33:03] for he pours out his spirit in its
[1:33:06] fullness
[1:33:07] until
[1:33:09] he
[1:33:10] changes the body of the living church
[1:33:13] let me tell you do not do not one moment
[1:33:17] give up
[1:33:18] on more of the pouring out of the holy
[1:33:20] ghost
[1:33:22] do not for a moment think we got it all
[1:33:25] now
[1:33:27] until our bodies change
[1:33:31] we will need a refilling after feeling
[1:33:34] after feeling after moving after moving
[1:33:36] after moving of the holy ghost
[1:33:43] you will need another drink from outside
[1:33:45] the eye
[1:33:46] you need you'll need another dip of the
[1:33:48] spirit you will need another draw from
[1:33:52] the life of god
[1:33:55] and it will happen until your bodies are
[1:33:57] changed
[1:33:58] don't ever stop progressing
[1:34:03] don't put a period in your experience
[1:34:06] i've got all that i need and i don't
[1:34:08] need anymore
[1:34:10] that's laodicea god i have needed
[1:34:12] nothing
[1:34:14] amen one of the very evidences of the
[1:34:17] holy spirit in your life will be a
[1:34:19] constant desire for more
[1:34:23] now you see again you see it's going to
[1:34:26] take el shaddai to do this almighty god
[1:34:29] it will require him to get a bride in
[1:34:32] the rapture
[1:34:33] it will require it look it required god
[1:34:36] to turn our hearts back to faith in
[1:34:38] believing again it required god not a
[1:34:41] denomination not a theologian a god to
[1:34:44] come and move and use a prophet to bring
[1:34:46] the word again
[1:34:48] whether we have what was presented in
[1:34:50] the book of acts
[1:34:52] it would take that it would take the
[1:34:54] supernatural and it's going to take the
[1:34:57] supernatural every step of the way
[1:35:02] now
[1:35:03] god promised that the grain of wheat
[1:35:05] that he planted at pentecost in the book
[1:35:07] of acts would return back to grain again
[1:35:10] now the other stages of the wheat plant
[1:35:13] the blade the toss of the shell
[1:35:15] they were not the promised restoration
[1:35:18] when god said i will restore and he
[1:35:20] planted a church and it was it was a
[1:35:23] weak grain a mature church a mature
[1:35:26] grain at pentecost he's got to have the
[1:35:28] same thing when he comes back again
[1:35:31] you don't harvest hay
[1:35:33] of the wheat
[1:35:35] you don't harvest the blade
[1:35:38] you don't harvest the shuck
[1:35:39] sucks no you don't do that
[1:35:42] right amen you want the grain god is
[1:35:46] coming for a mature church a mature body
[1:35:49] a restored people
[1:35:53] now
[1:35:54] so you see
[1:35:56] this is like it was with abraham even as
[1:35:59] ishmael was not the promised son
[1:36:02] neither was a zoos of pentecost a
[1:36:05] restoration of pentecost
[1:36:08] it's called that
[1:36:09] just like ishmael was called
[1:36:11] the son the promised son
[1:36:15] and even abraham abram believed that for
[1:36:17] a while
[1:36:18] until god said no no no he's not the one
[1:36:21] that was of your strength i'm going to
[1:36:23] bring one of the supernatural
[1:36:27] so you see the seed that was planted and
[1:36:30] during the dark ages it came up
[1:36:33] and the corn began to grow and so we had
[1:36:36] different stages of the same wheat plant
[1:36:38] it wasn't that luther wasn't wheat they
[1:36:40] were wheat they were just another stage
[1:36:43] not a harvestable stage
[1:36:45] that's why rapture didn't take place in
[1:36:47] that day
[1:36:48] but you see we are at a harvestable
[1:36:51] stage
[1:36:53] amen where that the wheat grain that was
[1:36:56] at pentecost has come now again in the
[1:36:59] last day for another harvest
[1:37:02] this time not to be planted and repeat
[1:37:05] ages over again
[1:37:07] but this time to go in the garner and go
[1:37:10] in a rapture
[1:37:13] amen so you've added down to the ages
[1:37:16] you had the the the
[1:37:18] advancement of the of the church as a
[1:37:20] wheat plant you'd have the missionary
[1:37:22] age and which was the pollen age and the
[1:37:25] thousands with was wesley and greatest
[1:37:28] missionaries and you know went around
[1:37:30] the world and excelled us many times in
[1:37:33] our age with their seal and everything
[1:37:35] else but what that age do is scattered
[1:37:38] like pollen in the breeze
[1:37:41] amen and then what's the next step now
[1:37:43] logically after the pollen you would
[1:37:46] think oh next thing is the grave right
[1:37:49] that's logic
[1:37:50] but before the grain comes the shock
[1:37:52] comes
[1:37:54] and that shock was azusa street
[1:37:58] it would look like the real seat so much
[1:38:03] that it would get misnamed pentecost
[1:38:13] it would get
[1:38:14] misnamed pentecost
[1:38:19] until today there's a confusion when you
[1:38:21] say pentecost many people think you're
[1:38:24] speaking about azusa street
[1:38:27] and pentecost they never was pentecost
[1:38:31] and they are pentecost they label
[1:38:33] themselves like ishmael did abraham's
[1:38:35] seed but he said that's not your seed
[1:38:39] they are not in the covenant
[1:38:42] i'm making a covenant are you with me
[1:38:44] i'm making a covenant with isaac
[1:38:48] i'm going to bring a son out of the pre
[1:38:51] a predestinated son
[1:38:53] by the supernatural
[1:38:56] and it'll be that supernatural church of
[1:38:59] people born of the word with the word of
[1:39:02] birth and they are the word the full
[1:39:07] word not part word all the word
[1:39:12] now
[1:39:13] so you have the husk or the chaff that
[1:39:16] comes to protect the seed and out of
[1:39:18] that would come the little seed we would
[1:39:20] be birthed right out of that shock
[1:39:23] movement
[1:39:24] what do you think brother branham came
[1:39:26] from he came right there who received
[1:39:28] him who protected him who let it grow
[1:39:30] where did that come where did that
[1:39:32] message start up in the azusa movement
[1:39:38] amen now you walk through those grain
[1:39:40] fields
[1:39:41] in the late summer
[1:39:43] pluck the heads of wheat
[1:39:45] rubbing your hands they get grain
[1:39:47] and at that stage they ain't none
[1:39:51] it shuck
[1:39:52] are they important yes
[1:39:55] was it a move of god yes
[1:39:58] did the holy ghost move there yes just
[1:40:00] like he did in abraham's past
[1:40:02] yes
[1:40:04] but now he's revealing himself in a
[1:40:05] greater way
[1:40:07] and he's going to pour out his fullness
[1:40:10] as almighty god with all the old and the
[1:40:13] new testament
[1:40:16] are you with me
[1:40:17] now
[1:40:18] so you open up that there ain't no grain
[1:40:21] in there
[1:40:23] you just got a chaff
[1:40:25] though it looked like surely wheat was
[1:40:27] there
[1:40:29] you see
[1:40:31] but to prove that it was not
[1:40:33] they just become another denomination
[1:40:38] they just become another bombs woman
[1:40:40] they showed herself as another slave
[1:40:44] to men's creeds
[1:40:48] amen and proving that instead of being
[1:40:50] the real seed they were the chaff
[1:40:54] amen they were just a protecting cover
[1:40:56] for the wheat seed that would come
[1:40:59] and it's this stage that is so dangerous
[1:41:02] because this stage is the stage that
[1:41:05] jesus said matthew 24 24 that they would
[1:41:08] deceive the elect if it were possible
[1:41:15] so become so close that you're sure you
[1:41:18] got grain
[1:41:20] but there ain't no grain in it
[1:41:23] it's not a mature church it never will
[1:41:25] mature into that it's got something come
[1:41:28] out of that that comes to maturity
[1:41:30] so you know man felt like this huck this
[1:41:33] husk this this um so-called pentecostal
[1:41:36] age was a true seed but it proved to be
[1:41:38] just a carrier carrying the life over
[1:41:41] the next age in which the true
[1:41:43] restoration comes and the weep bride is
[1:41:46] manifested in power
[1:41:49] so you see
[1:41:50] there was not a restoration back in
[1:41:53] luther that was not
[1:41:54] the restoration of the original grain it
[1:41:57] was just a further advancement toward
[1:42:00] that
[1:42:01] wesleyan church did not restore
[1:42:04] and then speaking of the azusa movement
[1:42:06] brother branham said the pentecostal age
[1:42:08] did not restore
[1:42:10] but god has to restore it because he
[1:42:12] cannot deny his word this is the
[1:42:15] restoration god will take the church
[1:42:18] right back to pentecost of the beginning
[1:42:22] so whatever was planted
[1:42:26] in the original church it's going to be
[1:42:29] here in the last day church
[1:42:32] now i have a reason for going over this
[1:42:34] because we want to understand what kind
[1:42:36] of people would she be
[1:42:39] she will be a genuine christ-centered
[1:42:41] christ-centered word of god christ's
[1:42:43] field christ-centered word of god
[1:42:46] that's what the bride will be a genuine
[1:42:49] christ-filled
[1:42:51] christ-centered word of god
[1:42:54] now and from this will come the royal
[1:42:57] seed of abraham
[1:43:00] the seed of the promise
[1:43:02] now
[1:43:03] and i want you to say today the promised
[1:43:06] seed is here
[1:43:09] amen not back at azusa street but right
[1:43:12] now
[1:43:13] it is this message that brings forth the
[1:43:16] promised seed
[1:43:18] the seed that is going to go in the
[1:43:20] garner
[1:43:21] now for those of you that don't know
[1:43:23] azuza street
[1:43:25] what that means well it was a street it
[1:43:27] was a street where there was a house in
[1:43:30] um in los angeles california it's actual
[1:43:33] street in los angeles called azusa
[1:43:36] and there was a a house there where that
[1:43:39] they met
[1:43:40] and they had a little upper room in it
[1:43:42] and a prayer room down low and and there
[1:43:44] they all gathered in the holy spirit
[1:43:46] fell and speaking in tongues began to
[1:43:48] take place and they began to have an
[1:43:50] outpouring of the holy spirit
[1:43:52] and so that from that little church
[1:43:55] meeting
[1:43:56] come now
[1:43:58] nearly um nearly 500 million
[1:44:02] believers today who believe
[1:44:05] because of that azusa movement
[1:44:09] and let me just say to you i mean we we
[1:44:11] too
[1:44:12] we too have roots back there just like
[1:44:14] we do in wesley and luther
[1:44:18] amen but you see the
[1:44:20] zeus movement was not the promised bride
[1:44:24] of pentecost
[1:44:26] just as ishmael was not the promised
[1:44:28] seed of abraham
[1:44:30] and that's why we're not trying to
[1:44:33] reproduce
[1:44:34] azusa street again
[1:44:37] many times people hear me preach on some
[1:44:39] of these things oh he's trying to go
[1:44:41] back to pentecost well i sure am
[1:44:44] that's what malachi 4 was to do turn our
[1:44:47] hearts back to where the pentecostal
[1:44:50] fathers
[1:44:51] but i'm not trying to get a people to go
[1:44:54] back to azusa street
[1:44:59] neither am i trying to bring a people
[1:45:01] back to baptist or methodist or lutheran
[1:45:03] in our beliefs
[1:45:05] but back to the original bible the full
[1:45:08] word of god are you with me
[1:45:11] amen so you see this message is a return
[1:45:14] back to pentecost but not a zoo's
[1:45:16] history but a continuation of the book
[1:45:19] of acts
[1:45:22] now ishmael was called the seed of
[1:45:24] abraham but was not the child of the
[1:45:25] promise of zeus it was thought to be to
[1:45:27] return to pentecost but it was not
[1:45:32] they thought because they spoke in
[1:45:34] tongues and manifested gifts of the
[1:45:36] spirit it was a long awaited restoration
[1:45:39] and brother branham said it was not
[1:45:42] for the latter rain can only come after
[1:45:44] the form of rain which is the springer
[1:45:46] teaching rain the latter rain then is a
[1:45:48] harvest ring
[1:45:49] how could this be the real thing when
[1:45:51] the teaching rain had not come
[1:45:53] the prophet messenger who was sent to
[1:45:56] teach the people and turn the hearts of
[1:45:58] the children back to the pentecostal
[1:45:59] fathers had not come thus was thought to
[1:46:02] be the restoration and the final
[1:46:04] quickening unto the rapture had not come
[1:46:06] and it was a mixture of unrighteous
[1:46:08] partaking of spiritual blessings and
[1:46:09] manifesting in the holy ghost as we kept
[1:46:12] pointing out to you it was also devil
[1:46:14] power well as men were under control of
[1:46:18] of devils yet no one seemed to realize
[1:46:20] and then to prove it was not real these
[1:46:23] people
[1:46:25] within seven years
[1:46:27] of the zusa movement
[1:46:30] formed
[1:46:32] a denomination
[1:46:35] on
[1:46:36] speaking in tongues
[1:46:38] being the initial evidence
[1:46:42] and so they organized
[1:46:44] and they wrote these kind of
[1:46:46] unscriptural doctrines
[1:46:50] and built their fences
[1:46:53] as every other group ahead of them did
[1:46:57] and they got a bunch of slaves
[1:47:00] that they keep confined
[1:47:03] now these pentecostal charismatic full
[1:47:06] gospel people were actually given the
[1:47:09] promise of el shaddai
[1:47:13] the open book about both the old new and
[1:47:16] new testament they were actually offered
[1:47:18] it
[1:47:20] but you see they were offered but
[1:47:22] instead of taking the open book that
[1:47:25] would restore them back to the original
[1:47:27] vine they took instead the breast from a
[1:47:30] denomination specifically they took
[1:47:34] speaking in tongues as initial evidence
[1:47:36] and denied the birth of the world
[1:47:40] now you get it they made speaking in
[1:47:43] tongues
[1:47:44] more important and greater than even the
[1:47:47] discernment
[1:47:49] which proved the word was now present
[1:47:52] because only the word discerns the
[1:47:54] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:47:56] so speaking in an unknown tongue or that
[1:47:59] nobody understands
[1:48:01] became more important
[1:48:04] than god discerning the heart
[1:48:08] turn with me to hebrews 4 12. i want to
[1:48:10] show you what the word of god is the
[1:48:11] word of god is quick that means it's
[1:48:13] alive
[1:48:16] it is powerful it is sharper than a
[1:48:18] two-edged sword it pierces even to the
[1:48:20] dividing asunder of soul and spirit
[1:48:22] brother it can get right down and pierce
[1:48:25] look way down
[1:48:26] into the very soul of man
[1:48:30] it can say you're shattered with death
[1:48:33] and that be cancer you're shadowed with
[1:48:35] death oh that's sin
[1:48:40] even the dividing of the soul and spirit
[1:48:42] and of the joints in the morrow and is
[1:48:44] the discerner of what
[1:48:46] thoughts
[1:48:47] and entrance of heart
[1:48:49] neither is there any creature that is
[1:48:51] not manifest in his sight
[1:48:55] in other words the word totally has a
[1:48:58] capability of totally exposing sin
[1:49:01] sickness disease everything
[1:49:04] but all things are naked and open unto
[1:49:07] the eyes of him with it with whom we
[1:49:09] have to do so that you see that the gift
[1:49:12] of discernment that we saw exhibit to
[1:49:15] the prophet of god was not
[1:49:17] the word of knowledge
[1:49:20] it was the same ministry it was not one
[1:49:23] of the nine gifts
[1:49:25] it was one the same ministry that
[1:49:29] identified that the messiah was here 2
[1:49:33] 000 years ago
[1:49:36] that very discernment that said your
[1:49:38] name is so-and-so and you came from so
[1:49:40] and so and you you know i see you coming
[1:49:42] across the sea
[1:49:43] and you've got this affliction and died
[1:49:46] and oh you know you're you're healed
[1:49:50] where where what was that that was that
[1:49:53] was the same ministry of jesus christ
[1:49:56] that was identified to us
[1:49:58] that the word was now present
[1:50:02] because only the word can do that
[1:50:07] that was the vindication the word had
[1:50:10] come to a prophet
[1:50:13] now the samaritan woman at the well
[1:50:15] whose heart would discern when she stood
[1:50:17] and her past was completely exposed
[1:50:20] before him
[1:50:21] when
[1:50:22] when the messiah comes she knew he would
[1:50:25] do these things see that was a sign of
[1:50:27] the messiah then
[1:50:31] amen it was the same ministry that
[1:50:34] identified and as elohim who appeared to
[1:50:37] abraham and sarah and told of isaac's
[1:50:40] coming
[1:50:41] discerned her heart in the tent behind
[1:50:43] him
[1:50:44] you see this proved to us
[1:50:47] god was speaking
[1:50:50] that's why it never failed
[1:50:53] because god can't fail
[1:50:56] amen brother branham now brother branham
[1:50:58] was not the messiah
[1:51:00] amen but his gift proved that the
[1:51:03] messiah the word was present
[1:51:07] so this discernment that you hear us
[1:51:09] talking about the discerns the thoughts
[1:51:10] and the influence of heart was to
[1:51:12] identify
[1:51:14] somebody who was present
[1:51:16] that knew your past your future
[1:51:19] your present who you were
[1:51:22] what your disease was what your sin was
[1:51:26] everything exposed before you before him
[1:51:30] amen now that was not identified brother
[1:51:33] branham as the messiah that was
[1:51:35] identified the messiah christ the
[1:51:38] anointed word was now here
[1:51:45] now
[1:51:49] also it was identification of the deity
[1:51:52] of god to the last age the amen
[1:51:55] because every time that brother branham
[1:51:57] would finish
[1:51:58] what he have the discernment said now
[1:52:01] god will speak
[1:52:03] and he and amen was given
[1:52:06] the final say
[1:52:08] if i have told you the truth
[1:52:10] let him come
[1:52:13] now you see this proved that god was
[1:52:16] speaking in this generation that the
[1:52:18] word had come
[1:52:21] now
[1:52:22] but pentecost the azusa movement made
[1:52:25] the least gift of the spirit which is
[1:52:28] speaking in tongues more important and
[1:52:30] greater than the word itself
[1:52:37] like
[1:52:38] what the word says about holiness
[1:52:42] as long as you speak in tongues
[1:52:44] you can still bob off your hair
[1:52:46] cross dress
[1:52:48] wear men's imperil
[1:52:49] go out in public in their underwear
[1:52:51] their shorts
[1:52:55] right
[1:52:56] wow as long as we spoke in tongues
[1:52:59] and they exalted the least gift greater
[1:53:04] than the sign of the messiah
[1:53:07] and they would reject the word
[1:53:11] over receiving their gift
[1:53:15] now i want you to get this
[1:53:17] so what's the pentecostal age as he come
[1:53:19] through there he made the promise of el
[1:53:21] shaddai
[1:53:22] nurse for me the question is can you
[1:53:24] nurse that was brought before the
[1:53:26] pentecostals seal said i was offered
[1:53:28] them can you nurse in other words can
[1:53:30] you receive it
[1:53:32] but they didn't do it they grabbed the
[1:53:33] breasts from a denomination where they
[1:53:35] came out of but then the real seed the
[1:53:38] seed the real seed came to nurse on that
[1:53:41] breast
[1:53:43] so one took a denominational breast the
[1:53:46] other has been offered a shed eye
[1:53:49] a real seed
[1:53:51] that has come to nurse on that until
[1:53:54] their bodies are changed
[1:53:57] i want you to get that thought
[1:53:58] now the ensues of movement organized on
[1:54:02] evidence of the holy ghost being
[1:54:04] speaking in tongues
[1:54:06] even daddy bosworth knew this was wrong
[1:54:10] he lost his position among them he was
[1:54:13] assembly of god he debated before the
[1:54:16] the general counsel assembly of god
[1:54:18] their organization he debated on the
[1:54:20] subject of tongues being the evidence of
[1:54:22] the holy ghost and it was not he
[1:54:24] declared is not the evidence
[1:54:27] or the initial evidence the holy ghost
[1:54:28] does speak with tongues but it's not
[1:54:30] it's not the initial evidence
[1:54:33] and he debated that before the assembly
[1:54:34] of god organization and they kicked him
[1:54:36] out
[1:54:40] so they took the breast of denomination
[1:54:43] by nursing for their strength
[1:54:45] a dogma of the church
[1:54:48] of the initial evidence of the holy
[1:54:50] ghost is speaking in tongues
[1:54:53] so what today is the strength of azusa
[1:54:56] pentecost
[1:54:58] i spoke in tongues
[1:55:04] i spoke in tongues
[1:55:06] and they can go out and backslide and
[1:55:08] come back to alder and speak in tongues
[1:55:09] they're all right they're ready to go
[1:55:11] rapture bound
[1:55:12] and go back out sin go out marry
[1:55:14] somebody else come back in the church
[1:55:16] and
[1:55:17] speak in tongues again
[1:55:20] because why that is the streak they are
[1:55:24] nursing
[1:55:26] from that organization
[1:55:28] and it's dubnia
[1:55:30] are you with me amen so they take the
[1:55:33] breast of denomination by nursing their
[1:55:37] strength a dogma of the church of the
[1:55:39] evidence of the holy ghost is speaking
[1:55:41] in tongues
[1:55:42] and that becomes the their assurance
[1:55:46] i have the holy ghost
[1:55:48] is because i spoke in tongues
[1:55:52] now that's where azusa made their
[1:55:55] mistake the holy ghost does indeed speak
[1:55:58] with tongues
[1:56:00] but the holy ghost is not tongues
[1:56:04] tongues is a gift of the spirit the same
[1:56:07] as gift of healing workings of miracles
[1:56:09] word of knowledge are all gifts of the
[1:56:11] spirit it's what the spirit does do
[1:56:14] amen tongues is not the evidence of the
[1:56:17] holy ghost it's just one of the many
[1:56:20] things that the holy ghost does
[1:56:24] tongues is a gift of the spirit not the
[1:56:27] spirit
[1:56:28] and yet they can still speak in tongues
[1:56:30] and bob their hair and paint their face
[1:56:33] and cross dress and drink cocktails and
[1:56:36] sniff a little cocaine or marry and
[1:56:38] divorce and remarry and even remain in
[1:56:41] their formal denominations even just
[1:56:43] speak in tongues and go back to their
[1:56:45] episcopalian church or catholic church
[1:56:47] and you know there the pope is speaking
[1:56:50] in tongues and the bishops are speaking
[1:56:52] in tongues and they all have the holy
[1:56:54] ghost
[1:56:55] because what they drank their strength
[1:57:00] that i now have the holy ghost
[1:57:03] from a dogma
[1:57:05] from the breast of a denomination
[1:57:09] amen now you see they will but yet they
[1:57:12] will reject the word even
[1:57:15] elementary
[1:57:17] basic truths
[1:57:19] like baptism in the name of the lord
[1:57:21] jesus christ
[1:57:24] but i'm going to heaven because
[1:57:26] my strength is based on my assurances
[1:57:29] based on i spoke in tongues
[1:57:32] but then turn around and reject
[1:57:34] the word of god
[1:57:39] in other words they won't let the word
[1:57:41] have preeminence
[1:57:45] now i'm trying to get to something
[1:57:46] because we're going to talk about the
[1:57:48] evidence of the holy ghost today and
[1:57:50] you're going to understand it's a the
[1:57:52] evidence is not going to be just one
[1:57:55] thing
[1:58:00] it's just like the evidence of being a
[1:58:02] human is not having hair
[1:58:05] you do have hair
[1:58:07] most humans have it most all of them if
[1:58:09] they're normal they have hair
[1:58:12] but everything that has hair is not a
[1:58:14] human
[1:58:17] so we cannot identify a dog is a human
[1:58:20] because it has hair
[1:58:22] it's a dog
[1:58:24] a cat has hair but it's a cat it's not a
[1:58:26] human
[1:58:27] but one of the traits of being human it
[1:58:29] will have hair
[1:58:32] right
[1:58:32] now the same thing tongues is like hair
[1:58:35] all humans have hair but everything that
[1:58:37] has hair is not a human hair is not the
[1:58:39] evidence of being a human
[1:58:43] amen so if so some of you are less human
[1:58:46] than others
[1:58:50] speaking in tongues is in the body of
[1:58:52] christ i mean believes that
[1:58:54] it's what we do
[1:58:57] i said it's what we do
[1:59:00] amen these signs follow them that
[1:59:03] believe it must be in every church
[1:59:05] the body of christ
[1:59:07] but everything that speaks in tongues
[1:59:10] is not the body of christ
[1:59:15] heathens will speak in tongues demons
[1:59:17] will speak in tongues
[1:59:19] and christians speak in tongues real
[1:59:21] ones
[1:59:23] so but you can't identify everything you
[1:59:26] cannot identify the holy ghost by just
[1:59:29] that one thing you know like jesus and
[1:59:32] the pharisees they they loved jesus
[1:59:35] when he was healing the sick but when he
[1:59:37] began to bring the word
[1:59:41] when he began to bring the word of god
[1:59:43] and begin to say things like i and my
[1:59:45] father are one and other things like
[1:59:47] that like original sin or serpent seed a
[1:59:51] holy life and predestination and baptism
[1:59:54] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:59:56] one god the shock will mock that
[2:00:00] and then the shop pulls away from it
[2:00:04] but the real genuine bride
[2:00:06] church will bring forth the entire word
[2:00:09] of god and i want to get that entire
[2:00:12] word of god not just one word
[2:00:16] every word man shall live by what
[2:00:20] every word life comes by believing every
[2:00:23] word
[2:00:27] the entire word of god and his fullness
[2:00:29] so what is our strength
[2:00:31] you know brother branham pondered this
[2:00:33] himself and he would say he would think
[2:00:35] you know uh well the fruits of the
[2:00:37] spirit you know you've got to have the
[2:00:39] fruits of the spirit by their fruits you
[2:00:40] will know them so he took galatians 5 22
[2:00:43] but the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[2:00:46] peace long suffering gentleness goodness
[2:00:48] faith meekness temperance against such
[2:00:50] there is no law and it's true the holy
[2:00:52] spirit will bear these kind of fruits in
[2:00:54] your life
[2:00:55] but then he realized that these that
[2:00:57] some can do this naturally too
[2:01:00] some people just naturally are more
[2:01:02] loving than others
[2:01:03] more long-suffering than others more
[2:01:05] gentle than others
[2:01:08] and it's not the holy ghost it's just
[2:01:10] natural
[2:01:14] amen and
[2:01:15] then some religions like
[2:01:17] muhammad or even christian science can
[2:01:19] produce them and at times he you know
[2:01:22] the pharisees would seem to exhibit
[2:01:25] more of these fruits than what jesus did
[2:01:29] you know but
[2:01:30] but let me just say if you have the holy
[2:01:32] ghost you are going to have these fruits
[2:01:37] but just because you love everybody and
[2:01:40] you say i love god well you know you can
[2:01:43] love god and even wind up in hell
[2:01:47] because there's all kinds of types of
[2:01:49] love
[2:01:51] you can be loving him for the wrong
[2:01:52] reason
[2:01:56] amen you there again you can speak in
[2:01:58] tongues and have genuine holy ghost
[2:02:00] tongues and still wind up in hell
[2:02:02] because it's not the holy ghost it is
[2:02:05] his gift
[2:02:08] and there is a difference between the
[2:02:11] gift and the giver
[2:02:14] like i've explained before you know i
[2:02:16] can i can i can give the gift of my pen
[2:02:20] right here to my son timothy son i'm
[2:02:22] going to give you a gift
[2:02:25] did that come from me
[2:02:26] where did you get that
[2:02:28] from me
[2:02:29] hey man does it look like something that
[2:02:32] would come from me
[2:02:33] i usually have that kind of pen don't i
[2:02:36] and i've given it to you but do you have
[2:02:38] me
[2:02:39] what do you have
[2:02:40] my pen
[2:02:42] amen you see you don't have me you have
[2:02:44] my pen you have my gift
[2:02:47] and people get the gift a lot of times
[2:02:53] they will speak in tongues or they will
[2:02:55] shout or they will dance or or they will
[2:02:57] have an emotional and they were and that
[2:03:00] was the holy ghost that damn it
[2:03:05] but they didn't get him
[2:03:11] you see that
[2:03:13] that's that you said well brother tim
[2:03:15] you know people shouldn't fake it no we
[2:03:17] should never fake it but we ought to
[2:03:19] press in
[2:03:20] i mean we ought to do that with
[2:03:22] everything that we got we ought to press
[2:03:24] in
[2:03:28] when you're seeking god you seek him
[2:03:30] with your whole heart with everything
[2:03:32] within you
[2:03:34] well crying isn't the hell the holy
[2:03:36] ghost but the holy ghost will make you
[2:03:37] cry so i didn't in the holy ghost but
[2:03:39] it'll make yourself
[2:03:41] i mean tongues is not the holy ghost but
[2:03:43] it'll it will speak in tongues that's
[2:03:45] what the holy ghost does
[2:03:48] it'll make you love everybody
[2:03:50] but just because you're good in love
[2:03:52] everybody don't mean you're going to
[2:03:53] heaven
[2:03:59] you see you you are you will have these
[2:04:02] fruits
[2:04:04] there's a lot of people that has a lot
[2:04:06] of joy
[2:04:07] really joyous
[2:04:09] really happy
[2:04:11] and they don't have the holy ghost but
[2:04:13] they've got joy
[2:04:15] they got some of my peace
[2:04:18] and they really really have convinced
[2:04:20] themselves and they're peaceful
[2:04:22] but you see it's not much different from
[2:04:25] humans and dogs both have an air
[2:04:28] because
[2:04:29] an animal has a hair doesn't mean
[2:04:32] he's human
[2:04:34] man shall live by every word that
[2:04:38] proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[2:04:41] that's why when we talk about being holy
[2:04:43] ghost field
[2:04:45] we are talking about a people who give
[2:04:47] the entire word
[2:04:50] preeminence not just a part
[2:04:53] some will give him preeminence till they
[2:04:55] speak in tongues but then they go and
[2:04:57] pop their hair off
[2:04:59] some will give him preeminence you know
[2:05:02] and get baptized in jesus name
[2:05:05] but then deny the holy ghost being an
[2:05:07] experience
[2:05:08] there's a there there's a lot will only
[2:05:10] go so far
[2:05:13] you see but
[2:05:14] but if we're going to live we're going
[2:05:16] to live by every word
[2:05:19] proceedeth out of the mouth of god you
[2:05:20] say brother tim i believe the message
[2:05:23] well believing the message is good
[2:05:26] but that can be just being able to read
[2:05:28] it
[2:05:29] so well that's sensible and i believe
[2:05:31] that because it's sensible you see but
[2:05:34] that's not the whole the evidence of the
[2:05:36] holy ghost
[2:05:38] but the holy ghost will believe the word
[2:05:42] amen
[2:05:45] now
[2:05:46] again
[2:05:47] you know jesus told us when he's on the
[2:05:49] earth
[2:05:50] he said believeth not this john 14 10.
[2:05:52] believe his thou not that i'm in the
[2:05:54] father and the father in me the words i
[2:05:56] speak unto you i speak not of myself but
[2:05:58] the father dwelleth in me he doeth the
[2:06:00] works
[2:06:01] so this is the manifestation the perfect
[2:06:04] manifestation
[2:06:06] of god in the spirit was by the
[2:06:09] indwelling spirit
[2:06:11] manifesting in word
[2:06:13] and
[2:06:14] acts
[2:06:15] and works
[2:06:17] and this is what this is what we must
[2:06:19] understand you see when the bride gets
[2:06:22] back to being a word bride
[2:06:24] she will produce the very works
[2:06:27] that jesus did
[2:06:34] because it's the spirit of god
[2:06:36] and they're all one will produce what
[2:06:38] jesus produced
[2:06:42] our doctrine will be the same as his
[2:06:45] and we will begin to do and teach
[2:06:48] not just teach it but do it
[2:06:52] you see jesus said my doctrine isn't my
[2:06:55] own it's my
[2:06:56] father's we got to realize the doctrine
[2:06:59] that we believe is not our doctrine it
[2:07:02] is not william branham's doctrine it is
[2:07:05] a doctrine of god the doctrine of the
[2:07:07] bible
[2:07:10] now the word will always come to the
[2:07:12] spirit field
[2:07:14] you see this is evidence of being filled
[2:07:17] with the holy ghost that's what jesus
[2:07:19] said would be the the the evidence and
[2:07:22] john
[2:07:23] um he said he said i will pray the
[2:07:26] father he will send you another
[2:07:27] comforter that he may abide for with you
[2:07:29] forever even the spirit of truth
[2:07:33] so the holy ghost is the spirit of truth
[2:07:36] it cannot be in you and not lead you to
[2:07:39] truth
[2:07:41] he cannot deny himself
[2:07:46] so every word of the bible every word
[2:07:49] that god said in his word you're going
[2:07:51] to believe it
[2:07:53] if you've got the holy ghost you know
[2:07:54] the word is truth that's what truth is
[2:07:58] the word
[2:08:00] amen so a believer that is filled with
[2:08:03] the holy ghost what will they do believe
[2:08:05] every word of god
[2:08:07] they'll be able to say amen to every
[2:08:09] word
[2:08:10] now not the ridiculous thing of some
[2:08:12] people got that in their mind oh it's
[2:08:14] saying amen so to prove i i believe it
[2:08:16] pastor gets up good morning church nice
[2:08:19] to be here this morning amen amen hey
[2:08:21] man what are they doing that was trying
[2:08:23] to prove they had the holy ghost because
[2:08:26] they are going to say amen to every word
[2:08:28] it's not your verbal amen
[2:08:32] if not what you're saying with your
[2:08:34] mouth or with your jump
[2:08:36] it's the life that you are living
[2:08:39] you sisters that dress holy are living
[2:08:42] according saying amen to first
[2:08:44] corinthians 11.
[2:08:47] are you with me amen you brothers and
[2:08:50] sisters that have been baptized in the
[2:08:51] name of jesus christ you are saying amen
[2:08:54] to acts 2 38.
[2:08:59] you see you see the amen is now living
[2:09:02] in your life and you are agreeing with
[2:09:04] that word and you are obedient to that
[2:09:07] word
[2:09:08] and it's not just one thing we just what
[2:09:11] if i just do this one thing so pentecost
[2:09:14] wanted to do this one thing
[2:09:16] and that is we can just speak in tongues
[2:09:18] and we got it we got it we got it you
[2:09:20] know i can have assurance i i i draw my
[2:09:23] strength from that you see
[2:09:26] it's not one thing
[2:09:28] it is
[2:09:29] it is
[2:09:30] there's many things that makes up a
[2:09:32] human
[2:09:34] there's many qualities that goes with
[2:09:36] him
[2:09:37] amen you know again
[2:09:39] there is lots of description that makes
[2:09:42] not just one there are many that
[2:09:46] identifies you as being a christian
[2:09:49] amen now if there's something in the
[2:09:51] bible something in the word of god and
[2:09:53] you can't say amen with it then you
[2:09:55] wonder do you have the holy ghost
[2:10:01] if you see
[2:10:02] worldliness and sin and cutting hair and
[2:10:06] makeup coming out against the bible and
[2:10:08] i'm quoting brother branham now it's a
[2:10:10] direct evidence
[2:10:12] you don't have the holy ghost
[2:10:15] because he cannot deny his own word
[2:10:21] if you refuse to take on the name of
[2:10:24] jesus christ in baptism
[2:10:26] it is absolute assurance you do not have
[2:10:30] the spirit of god
[2:10:33] if you make our god into two lords three
[2:10:35] lords or trinitarian or whatever else
[2:10:38] and you turn them out from this one god
[2:10:40] bible it is identification you don't
[2:10:43] have the holy ghost
[2:10:48] now so you see why because the spirit of
[2:10:51] truth john 16 13 when the spirit of
[2:10:54] truth the word has come he will lead and
[2:10:56] guide you into all truth all the word
[2:11:00] and he'll not speak of himself but what
[2:11:02] he will ever hear of the of the word of
[2:11:04] god he shall speak
[2:11:06] and he will show you things to come so
[2:11:08] the spirit will actually bring words of
[2:11:10] prophecy
[2:11:13] so the evidence
[2:11:15] would be in the truth that you would be
[2:11:18] in the word for your age
[2:11:21] well i'm in the message brother tim i've
[2:11:23] got it no
[2:11:25] no just because you belong to the
[2:11:27] society of the church
[2:11:30] doesn't put you in the word
[2:11:32] your only way into the word into the
[2:11:36] body of christ is by a birth
[2:11:39] and that's an experience
[2:11:41] so you see again to receive the word the
[2:11:44] truth is to believe it and obey it
[2:11:47] so if you have the spirit you will hear
[2:11:50] the word for your age
[2:11:54] amen as even every true christian down
[2:11:57] to the ages took the word for their age
[2:11:59] you also will do the same
[2:12:01] being one with the word proves whether
[2:12:03] you are of god
[2:12:05] and the spirit field there is no other
[2:12:08] criterion
[2:12:11] now so again
[2:12:13] again it isn't just i'm going to do one
[2:12:15] thing
[2:12:16] i'm going to speak in tongues and i got
[2:12:18] it or i'm gonna have love and if i love
[2:12:22] everybody i got it
[2:12:25] or if i if i if i wear
[2:12:29] this kind of uniform
[2:12:33] you understand a lot of people will come
[2:12:35] and become a part of the society of a
[2:12:37] church and they learn the uniform of a
[2:12:40] christian
[2:12:42] so i'm wearing the uniform of when i
[2:12:44] dress this way my hair is that way my
[2:12:46] dress is that way my you know i don't do
[2:12:49] this and i don't do that and you wear
[2:12:50] the uniform
[2:12:52] and you fit in and you look like one
[2:12:56] but your heart's got to be changed
[2:13:00] amen so you see the sign that we really
[2:13:03] believe
[2:13:04] and and receive the holy ghost says we
[2:13:06] believe all the word
[2:13:09] and that it manifests in the body of
[2:13:12] believers that we are worshiping with
[2:13:16] because in the body believers there's
[2:13:19] going to be these signs
[2:13:22] now all won't speak with tongues
[2:13:26] out of the five instances in the bible
[2:13:29] you know that where they received the
[2:13:30] holy ghost three of them they spoke in
[2:13:32] tongues one they actually spoke in
[2:13:34] tongues and prophesied
[2:13:37] two of them they didn't speak of
[2:13:39] speaking in tongues
[2:13:41] if tongues was the evidence god would
[2:13:44] have absolutely wrote it in the word you
[2:13:48] must pray until you speak in tongues to
[2:13:51] have the holy ghost
[2:13:53] this will be the initial evidence of
[2:13:56] receiving it would have to be written in
[2:13:58] the bible we got too much word here and
[2:14:02] too much silence on that
[2:14:04] there is no scriptural evidence that you
[2:14:06] got to speak in tongues to be
[2:14:09] filled with the holy ghost but the holy
[2:14:11] ghost does speak with tongues
[2:14:15] in fact to the
[2:14:16] latter of the times of receiving the
[2:14:18] holy ghost more times than not they
[2:14:20] spoke in tongues
[2:14:26] so rather than there being less
[2:14:28] prominent it ought to be more prominent
[2:14:32] because though these signs shall follow
[2:14:35] them that believe in other words in the
[2:14:38] group of believers in the church in the
[2:14:40] body of christ there's going to be
[2:14:42] tongues interpretation prophecy
[2:14:46] gifts of the spirit divine healing
[2:14:48] miracles
[2:14:49] all of that will be
[2:14:51] in the believers
[2:14:53] not one person doing all of that but it
[2:14:55] will be in the body
[2:15:01] now in the body these signs shall follow
[2:15:04] them to believe they shall speak with
[2:15:06] new tongues
[2:15:07] this is mark 16
[2:15:09] to not speaking in tongues today to say
[2:15:12] we don't do that no more or that's just
[2:15:15] pentecostal
[2:15:17] so we don't do that that was for an age
[2:15:19] past that's not something we do today
[2:15:21] you see
[2:15:22] then you are denying mark 16.
[2:15:30] because jesus said this is going to be
[2:15:33] in my church
[2:15:35] they will speak with new tongues
[2:15:39] but paul comes along and says do we all
[2:15:40] speak with tongues to all have gifts of
[2:15:42] healing that we all prophesy the obvious
[2:15:44] answer to that is no
[2:15:47] but that's some unbelievers
[2:15:51] you see
[2:15:52] so so there again when paul was
[2:15:55] converted there was no tongues
[2:15:57] when down in samaria it was tongues
[2:15:59] wasn't mentioned
[2:16:01] but you see if tongues was the
[2:16:03] requirement and the initial evidence of
[2:16:05] the holy ghost wouldn't the bible say so
[2:16:09] it tells us plainly how to be baptized
[2:16:12] it tells us plainly that god is one not
[2:16:15] three
[2:16:16] it tells us plainly the doctrines of the
[2:16:19] scripture of predestination wouldn't it
[2:16:21] say in the bible
[2:16:24] you see if this was of the importance
[2:16:26] that the church
[2:16:27] but this became this became that
[2:16:31] strength
[2:16:32] of the organization
[2:16:36] so pentecost took speaking in tongues
[2:16:39] and denied the birth of the word
[2:16:43] the supernatural birth
[2:16:45] now it's the birth of the word in you
[2:16:47] now not intellectually agreeing with it
[2:16:50] or giving a mental assent is a
[2:16:53] life-changing power that makes you
[2:16:55] believe all the word of god
[2:16:58] amen you believe holiness
[2:17:01] because without it you'll not see the
[2:17:03] lord
[2:17:05] amen well brother tim we don't believe
[2:17:07] in the gift i don't know who we is
[2:17:10] because if you believe that you can't
[2:17:12] have the holy ghost
[2:17:14] we don't believe in speaking in tongues
[2:17:16] that's because you don't have the holy
[2:17:17] ghost
[2:17:18] you will we think hey you know healings
[2:17:20] and miracles are true but it's not the
[2:17:23] season for it because you don't have the
[2:17:25] holy ghost
[2:17:27] you see we we believe the seven seals or
[2:17:30] we don't believe that seven seals are
[2:17:31] open it's because the holy ghost isn't
[2:17:34] there
[2:17:35] we don't believe in preachers well your
[2:17:37] problem is you don't have the holy ghost
[2:17:40] you have to agree with the word
[2:17:44] amen if god put a fifo ministry in it
[2:17:47] show me where he took it out until you
[2:17:49] can show me where he took it out shut
[2:17:51] your mouth and believe it
[2:17:55] you see but man reason today
[2:17:58] well it's not the season or we're past
[2:18:00] that time are we going you see that is
[2:18:02] the spirit of the antichrist
[2:18:05] because why if he can get you off of one
[2:18:08] word
[2:18:10] you see israel came by reasoning and
[2:18:12] man's own human efforts to bring the
[2:18:15] word to pass without the supernatural
[2:18:18] and instead of the supernatural you know
[2:18:21] what this zusa bunch did just like
[2:18:23] abraham did
[2:18:25] you know when he took hagar and out of
[2:18:27] his own strength produced he took
[2:18:29] speaking in tongues a worked up emotion
[2:18:32] with manufactured tongues
[2:18:35] instead of waiting for the real
[2:18:37] manifestation of god
[2:18:39] our even taking the real gift of tongues
[2:18:43] and exalting it over the giver himself
[2:18:50] you have water baptism
[2:18:53] like we're going to have today
[2:18:55] if you was in an azusa church
[2:18:58] that would gather around you
[2:19:00] and cause jabber to come out of your
[2:19:02] mouth by saying screaming at you saying
[2:19:04] say it say it say it
[2:19:06] say glory glory glory glory
[2:19:08] say praise the lord praise the lord
[2:19:10] praise the lord say thank you jesus
[2:19:12] thank you jesus thank you they would
[2:19:13] scream those things at you and you would
[2:19:16] you by trying listen by works
[2:19:22] it's bomb's woman again
[2:19:25] it's not a spontaneous move of the holy
[2:19:28] ghost that's what happened on the day of
[2:19:29] pentecost the holy ghost fell and they
[2:19:32] spoke in tongues glorifying god now i've
[2:19:35] said i really don't care what language
[2:19:37] you speak in when you are baptized in
[2:19:40] the name of jesus christ and you see the
[2:19:42] holy ghost your life will glorify god
[2:19:47] it don't matter to me if it's in italian
[2:19:50] language or the japanese language or in
[2:19:52] the english language
[2:19:54] but your life will glorify god
[2:19:58] that's what the holy ghost will do to
[2:20:00] you it will cause you
[2:20:02] your whole life to glorify him
[2:20:08] now at this junction when the true
[2:20:10] manifestations are being made known
[2:20:12] to the people who have the work
[2:20:15] now we have been offered the breast to
[2:20:18] milk jedi else had i
[2:20:21] and we have the opportunity to receive
[2:20:24] the holy ghost as they did
[2:20:27] in the book of acts
[2:20:31] and when that happens men want to
[2:20:33] crucify it
[2:20:35] we won't have that nonsense in our
[2:20:37] church we don't want tongue speaking
[2:20:40] acts 2 38 youngins
[2:20:44] too many have listened to the serpent
[2:20:47] who has been looking for the secret of
[2:20:49] their power
[2:20:52] attempting to turn us into a powerless
[2:20:54] group of people
[2:20:56] listen we must not
[2:20:58] be a people who don't allow all the word
[2:21:01] to have preeminence
[2:21:04] you see somebody's going to believe it
[2:21:06] and it will work through them
[2:21:08] i'm talking about all the word not just
[2:21:11] part of it
[2:21:14] remember i started out saying even the
[2:21:16] true word
[2:21:18] parts of that word can be given to the
[2:21:20] bonds woman and it'll produce a life an
[2:21:22] ishmael
[2:21:24] but we don't want a bunch of wild
[2:21:26] children
[2:21:28] we want children that are obedient to
[2:21:30] the word the kind of the second adam
[2:21:33] are you with me
[2:21:35] now you see adam's pride believed every
[2:21:38] word every bit of the word but was
[2:21:40] confused on one promise and that he's
[2:21:42] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:21:45] don't get confused on that promise
[2:21:48] so when you look at anything in the
[2:21:50] bible you got to remember that he's the
[2:21:52] same yesterday today and forever if it's
[2:21:56] healing he's the same today as he was
[2:21:58] yesterday if it's baptism in his name
[2:22:01] it's the same as it was yesterday
[2:22:04] amen if it's speaking in tongues it's
[2:22:06] the same as it was yesterday if it's
[2:22:09] divine healing it's the same yesterday
[2:22:12] today and forever
[2:22:15] you see she got confused on one but one
[2:22:18] promise
[2:22:20] and and he said but she failed under the
[2:22:23] temptation of the enemy
[2:22:26] faced to face and now the people that
[2:22:29] has called for his name of course is his
[2:22:32] bride and she has to come in contact by
[2:22:34] the same thing not by denominational
[2:22:36] truth or something but every word so god
[2:22:39] brings us right back to where eve was
[2:22:42] [Music]
[2:22:44] and he denied one word of god
[2:22:47] and it caused all the sin to come
[2:22:50] now we're coming back where every bit of
[2:22:53] the word has been unsealed and there is
[2:22:56] a bride that's going to receive every
[2:22:59] bit of the word
[2:23:01] i said every bit of the word
[2:23:04] amen you see you say well brother tim uh
[2:23:08] he's the same yeah he's the same but in
[2:23:11] a way okay well let's have a prayer line
[2:23:13] well we don't believe in prayer lines
[2:23:15] well what happened to they to lay hands
[2:23:17] on the sick
[2:23:19] and they shall recover
[2:23:21] that is to be among believers
[2:23:24] i'm going to say it if you don't believe
[2:23:26] in prayer lines you don't have the holy
[2:23:28] ghost
[2:23:32] amen plain and simple
[2:23:34] hey man you you got a bad disbelief from
[2:23:37] methodist belief
[2:23:40] you don't even have a good azusa belief
[2:23:42] you got something way back yonder
[2:23:45] under alexander campbell which is
[2:23:47] baptist
[2:23:48] candlelight's church of christ who says
[2:23:51] days of miracles are past
[2:23:54] amen
[2:23:56] again but but you see that's refusing to
[2:23:59] give christ preeminence
[2:24:03] and my brother donny reagan and his
[2:24:05] church are having a prayer line today
[2:24:07] it's probably still going on
[2:24:09] people coming around from all over the
[2:24:10] world you've been flying in from norway
[2:24:12] in different places coming for that
[2:24:14] prayer line
[2:24:16] i think that's wonderful
[2:24:18] i think that's what the bride ought to
[2:24:19] be doing
[2:24:27] amen i believe that
[2:24:29] amen i sent him a quote here you know
[2:24:32] just before this prayer line and brother
[2:24:34] branham was talking about the preachers
[2:24:36] he said you're gonna he said god
[2:24:38] anointed preachers he said i want to
[2:24:40] call them up there he said now brothers
[2:24:42] you're going to lay hands on the sick
[2:24:44] and he said it's going to be like an ark
[2:24:46] a.r.c
[2:24:47] and he said you know with your hands
[2:24:49] like that he said it reflects solomon's
[2:24:52] temple with the over saturn wings
[2:24:54] and there's a minister standing on this
[2:24:56] side of the line raise their hand and
[2:24:58] this side you're approaching the mercy
[2:25:00] seat where their healing is and you're
[2:25:03] passing under the wings of those angels
[2:25:06] the ministry of god earthly angels
[2:25:09] laying their hands on you and they shall
[2:25:12] recover
[2:25:15] hallelujah
[2:25:16] why wouldn't the pride believe in that
[2:25:19] amen sure she will she's got the holy
[2:25:22] ghost
[2:25:24] but if you refuse to give him
[2:25:25] preeminence it's refusing to give him
[2:25:28] voice
[2:25:29] how can you show his omnipotence and
[2:25:31] allow him to reign
[2:25:33] you see because it's refusing his
[2:25:35] commission laying hands on the sick and
[2:25:38] they shall recover
[2:25:41] oh well okay
[2:25:42] you know we we believe we believe he's
[2:25:45] the same brother tim okay let's have an
[2:25:46] altar call well we don't believe in
[2:25:48] altar calls well i don't know who we are
[2:25:51] but it ain't me
[2:25:54] amen we got too many stillborn babies
[2:25:57] amen who the voice of god is not living
[2:26:00] through
[2:26:01] and the only ones that the word can
[2:26:03] bring forth and screaming hollered
[2:26:04] blabbering acts 2 38 youngins
[2:26:07] tongue speaking youngins
[2:26:09] come on church amen so therefore you
[2:26:13] know we do believe in the altar calls
[2:26:16] because we still believe he's the same
[2:26:18] yesterday today and forever
[2:26:21] brother branham would preach leadership
[2:26:24] being led by the holy ghost 1965 i want
[2:26:27] to have an old-fashioned altar call
[2:26:30] they're out of date now but it's never
[2:26:32] out of date with god
[2:26:35] hallelujah let me tell you friends i
[2:26:37] believe in old-fashioned holy ghosts
[2:26:41] moving upon souls that cause them to
[2:26:44] find a place to pray and call out to god
[2:26:47] until their lives are changed
[2:26:50] you can't have the holy ghost to not
[2:26:52] believe in altar clause
[2:26:54] say it's a methodist tradition well i'll
[2:26:57] tell you what they did make a tradition
[2:26:58] out well in the bible it wasn't so well
[2:27:02] you say brother tim they were there in
[2:27:03] the house of the cornelius and while
[2:27:06] they heard the word the holiest fell
[2:27:08] upon them and how did they know because
[2:27:10] we heard them speak in tongues and
[2:27:12] prophesy
[2:27:14] something happened not just embracing a
[2:27:17] message and say well i believe god sent
[2:27:19] a prophet but something happened
[2:27:22] amen while the word was preached what
[2:27:25] happened something happened it fell upon
[2:27:27] the people
[2:27:31] see it didn't call an altar yes it did
[2:27:33] they had an altar right there in their
[2:27:34] heart right there in their home
[2:27:37] amen
[2:27:38] so well okay
[2:27:41] well we believe he's the same okay let's
[2:27:43] have our people get the holy ghost like
[2:27:44] they did on the day of pentecost well we
[2:27:46] don't believe in an experience like they
[2:27:49] had at pentecost
[2:27:50] we don't even want an atmosphere like
[2:27:52] that in our church
[2:27:58] what in the world have we come to
[2:28:02] when we don't want the atmosphere of the
[2:28:04] holy ghost in our church
[2:28:12] brother branham said god is able at this
[2:28:14] minute to speak every cancer out of this
[2:28:16] building
[2:28:18] to open every blinded eye
[2:28:20] to set everybody in the liberty and this
[2:28:22] and freedom and liberty
[2:28:24] god has provided ways made away sin his
[2:28:27] son jesus christ and the holy ghost is
[2:28:30] brooding over us today
[2:28:33] the holy ghost is all over is blessing
[2:28:35] us it brings us into an atmosphere
[2:28:39] why you can take a shin egg and put it
[2:28:42] under a brooder house and and the mother
[2:28:44] don't him don't have to be over the egg
[2:28:46] to hatch it just so some warmth is over
[2:28:49] it'll hatch it's talking about the
[2:28:51] incubator now what is the egg he's using
[2:28:53] the egg represents the promise
[2:28:56] so whether it's the promise of healing
[2:28:58] or the promise of the holy ghost
[2:29:01] somebody with me whatever the promise is
[2:29:04] you've got to get it in the right
[2:29:05] atmosphere
[2:29:08] amen then he anointed preachers and set
[2:29:12] it out now to bring the word to put the
[2:29:14] eggs in the right position place so what
[2:29:18] i'm doing when i preach is i'm trying to
[2:29:20] take the promises of the word get them
[2:29:23] in the right position and get the
[2:29:25] atmosphere of the holy ghost over
[2:29:27] because i know if the warmth of the
[2:29:30] spirit comes and broods over that word
[2:29:32] it's going to take life in somebody's
[2:29:34] heart and there's a change coming
[2:29:38] hallelujah there's healing coming amen
[2:29:41] there's salvation coming
[2:29:44] okay well let's have a next personal
[2:29:47] experience with god well we don't need
[2:29:49] an experience we got the holy ghost
[2:29:51] without knowing it nobody not one
[2:29:54] example in the bible ever got the holy
[2:29:57] ghost and didn't know it
[2:30:00] it is an absolute experience
[2:30:04] not a baptist mental ascent
[2:30:10] amen
[2:30:12] oh well let's pray for the sick well
[2:30:14] divine healings of mine are not a major
[2:30:16] oh so it's not important
[2:30:19] then why is it in the atonement
[2:30:23] it was important to god so important
[2:30:26] your healing
[2:30:28] it was so important to god that he took
[2:30:31] stripes for it
[2:30:34] so you could be healed
[2:30:37] amen he you see everywhere that jesus
[2:30:40] went he healed the sick
[2:30:44] and that jesus is the same
[2:30:47] come on
[2:30:48] then he has the same attitude toward the
[2:30:50] sick that he had them
[2:30:54] and it is a solemn obligation of every
[2:30:57] true preacher
[2:30:59] to pray and then bring the word to the
[2:31:01] dying and the needy people
[2:31:04] amen to get that promise in the
[2:31:07] atmosphere of the holy ghost so it'll
[2:31:09] happen
[2:31:11] well brother tim we're third full
[2:31:13] believers
[2:31:14] of the opening of the word okay
[2:31:17] well then the tenth vision which was the
[2:31:19] third pull had altar calls and prayer
[2:31:21] lines
[2:31:22] well we don't believe in a
[2:31:25] i make personal experience with god you
[2:31:27] see we're we're third pull we're we're
[2:31:30] we're we're word believers okay
[2:31:33] well in the vision
[2:31:34] people going in the little room in that
[2:31:36] third pulled vision they all had a
[2:31:39] personal experience with god
[2:31:41] every one of them did
[2:31:43] amen they everyone went into the
[2:31:45] presence of the pillar of fire
[2:31:47] well what about science following them
[2:31:49] to believe well we don't need signs
[2:31:51] today
[2:31:52] you see that was only to vindicate the
[2:31:54] message not to the messages come
[2:31:57] we don't need signs
[2:31:59] so you see the days of miracles are past
[2:32:02] them
[2:32:06] are you sure
[2:32:07] i just want to say to these candlelights
[2:32:10] you want to call me
[2:32:12] pentecostal
[2:32:14] what about you candlelights
[2:32:17] i'll do a little name calling
[2:32:19] what do you mean campbellites alexander
[2:32:21] campbell's formed from the baptist
[2:32:23] movement he formed the church of christ
[2:32:26] and their their main emphasis was we'll
[2:32:29] speak where the bible speaks in silent
[2:32:30] word silence so god doesn't do miracles
[2:32:33] today
[2:32:35] that was only for the church the early
[2:32:36] church in the apostle
[2:32:39] so you see
[2:32:41] i
[2:32:42] and i quote from brother branham said
[2:32:44] you say wait a minute i'm taught in the
[2:32:45] church of christ days of miracles has
[2:32:47] passed he says you got a devil
[2:32:53] that's right
[2:32:55] oh i belong to the church of christ like
[2:32:57] i said that was alexander's organization
[2:33:00] alexander campbell you can read about
[2:33:02] him he was uh in in the in the hundreds
[2:33:05] there he formed the what's called the
[2:33:08] christian church in churches of christ
[2:33:10] and and they say the days of miracles
[2:33:12] have passed he said they are false
[2:33:14] prophets yes
[2:33:17] i wanna tell you something everywhere
[2:33:18] brother branham went he had to defend
[2:33:20] divine healing
[2:33:22] gifts of the spirit
[2:33:24] the movement of the holy ghost
[2:33:28] everywhere and he was having to defend
[2:33:30] it against
[2:33:31] alexander campbell's movement
[2:33:34] they were one on the radio saying
[2:33:36] there's i'll give you a thousand dollars
[2:33:38] anybody can produce a miracle
[2:33:40] brother branham brings a a a testimony
[2:33:43] of a miracle and a doctor's deal and
[2:33:45] they say well that money ain't here it's
[2:33:47] up in the organization and they they
[2:33:50] have to prove it but i'll tell you take
[2:33:51] this little girl cut her hand and show
[2:33:53] me you can heal
[2:33:55] he said you devil
[2:33:58] said you're no different to them in the
[2:34:00] days of those devils in the days of
[2:34:02] jesus come off that cross and we'll
[2:34:04] believe you
[2:34:06] amen there are false prophets
[2:34:09] he said ask one of them people they
[2:34:11] think the holy ghost is for day why
[2:34:12] certainly not do you believe divine
[2:34:14] healing is certainly not then he's an
[2:34:16] unbeliever
[2:34:18] if the holy ghost is in you one he
[2:34:20] testified to his own word and if the
[2:34:22] spirit is in you testifies contrary to
[2:34:25] what the word is says it's true it is
[2:34:27] not the spirit of christ
[2:34:30] you see you've got to have the
[2:34:32] circumcision of the holy ghost that cuts
[2:34:34] that unbelief off of you and when you do
[2:34:37] then you can believe in divine healing
[2:34:39] why because you received it in your soul
[2:34:43] amen you know it changes from death to
[2:34:45] life
[2:34:46] amen so you see with the with some
[2:34:48] groups it became like i said saying amen
[2:34:52] to every word this we got the perfect
[2:34:53] word now brother tim and you see this
[2:34:56] was alexander campbell's argument his
[2:34:59] argument was we have the complete canon
[2:35:02] of the bible
[2:35:03] nothing can be added nothing can be
[2:35:05] taken from it
[2:35:07] so this is a complete word of god that
[2:35:10] which is perfect has come
[2:35:12] so anything in part
[2:35:14] is done away so you prophesy in part and
[2:35:16] you know in part and then you know
[2:35:20] and so tongues of cease and
[2:35:23] gifts of cease and
[2:35:25] guess what else these knowledge is cease
[2:35:29] so you're a bunch of dumb people now
[2:35:33] knowledge is ceased
[2:35:36] read the bible there's a lot of things
[2:35:38] when that that which is perfect is come
[2:35:41] then just having part
[2:35:43] is done away with
[2:35:46] about when you receive and embrace the
[2:35:49] true word you don't just have part of it
[2:35:52] tongues
[2:35:53] or believe in christ
[2:35:55] or
[2:35:56] or sprinkling baptism all of them are
[2:35:59] baptism but it's part of the word it's
[2:36:01] not all of the word is not the right
[2:36:03] word
[2:36:05] come on now when that which is perfect
[2:36:07] has come having part is done away with
[2:36:12] amen so now then when that which is
[2:36:14] perfect comes we have now the word in
[2:36:17] its fullness
[2:36:19] we don't just have part of it in this
[2:36:21] word we have tongues in this we have
[2:36:23] interpretation in this we have the power
[2:36:25] of god in this we have divine healing in
[2:36:28] this we have the baptism of the holy
[2:36:30] ghost in this the seven seals are
[2:36:32] revealed in this we know we're
[2:36:34] predestinated before the foundational
[2:36:36] world in this we know our name was
[2:36:39] ripped in glory before the foundation of
[2:36:42] the world in this we know we no longer
[2:36:46] have heart we have all of it
[2:36:54] well
[2:36:55] but don't you know that quote brother
[2:36:56] tim and question answer 64.
[2:36:59] you see we have the perfect word now and
[2:37:02] he said so jumping up and down like a
[2:37:04] kid and speaking his tongues
[2:37:07] is over with
[2:37:09] because we got the perfect word so
[2:37:11] jumping up and down like a kid
[2:37:13] speaking in tongues is over with
[2:37:16] that's not
[2:37:18] what he said
[2:37:23] what he said
[2:37:25] was jumping up and down like a kid
[2:37:28] trying to speak with toms is over
[2:37:35] we don't have to jumping down
[2:37:37] to get the holy ghost
[2:37:40] we don't have to jumping up and down
[2:37:42] like a kid and try to speak in tongues
[2:37:46] no that's over with in other words
[2:37:49] trying to impersonate
[2:37:51] and force tongues
[2:37:53] upon people is over with
[2:37:55] [Music]
[2:37:59] you see bringing a confusion of tongues
[2:38:02] is over with
[2:38:05] getting people to jabber and saying
[2:38:06] that's holy ghost tongues is over with
[2:38:11] now
[2:38:12] again question answers brother bradham
[2:38:14] said this
[2:38:15] he said now a lot of times i've seen
[2:38:17] many people accepting initial evidence
[2:38:20] speak in tongues as the holy ghost
[2:38:22] sometimes shake the people and beat them
[2:38:24] and pat them and say say it say it say
[2:38:26] it you know repeat a word over it say it
[2:38:28] say it say it
[2:38:30] it's something you're doing yourself
[2:38:33] and it's nothing
[2:38:36] you know what the problem said it's
[2:38:38] nothing they are putting their
[2:38:40] consolation and their eternal security
[2:38:42] on nothing
[2:38:44] on a self-work
[2:38:47] you might get a confusion of tongues you
[2:38:50] might get a lot of things in sensation
[2:38:53] but if anything comes outside of your
[2:38:55] own personal faith it has to be a divine
[2:38:57] gift of god given to you
[2:39:00] see don't don't you see that's not a
[2:39:02] spontaneous move of the holy ghost it's
[2:39:04] again works
[2:39:06] man by his own efforts
[2:39:09] makes himself have a confusion of
[2:39:12] tongues
[2:39:14] and
[2:39:15] works
[2:39:16] works man's efforts to save himself
[2:39:21] is what the bonds woman does
[2:39:29] now brother branham said in 64
[2:39:33] he also says
[2:39:35] if the church would work in harmony like
[2:39:37] that that among us would be casting out
[2:39:39] devils
[2:39:41] taking up serpents drinking deadly
[2:39:42] things all kinds of things going on but
[2:39:44] when you force that to individuals
[2:39:47] then you get yourself that's pentecostal
[2:39:49] again speaking of azusa
[2:39:51] then you get babylon confusion
[2:39:54] but then he went on in that same
[2:39:58] block of words
[2:40:00] to say i wish every one of you spoke in
[2:40:04] tongues
[2:40:05] i sure do
[2:40:09] so if it's over with
[2:40:11] why does he wish we would do it
[2:40:15] and that's what paul said wouldn't he
[2:40:17] have to say what paul said
[2:40:19] paul said first corinthians 14 5 i would
[2:40:22] that you all spoke with tongues
[2:40:26] brother branham
[2:40:27] wished that every one of you would have
[2:40:29] the experience of speaking in tongues
[2:40:33] instead of 99 of message believers never
[2:40:36] having the experience
[2:40:38] he wished that every one of you had that
[2:40:40] experience
[2:40:44] and he said
[2:40:46] paul said i wish you all spoke with
[2:40:50] tongues
[2:40:51] but rather did you prophesy for greater
[2:40:54] is he that prophesied than he that
[2:40:56] speaketh with tongues
[2:40:57] so he said prophecy is greater tongues
[2:40:59] is the least of the gifts and pentecost
[2:41:02] made the least the most important
[2:41:05] that without it you couldn't have the
[2:41:06] holy ghost you couldn't get it you
[2:41:08] couldn't have it couldn't know you had
[2:41:09] it
[2:41:10] couldn't go to heaven unless you spoke
[2:41:11] in tongues they made that from the
[2:41:14] breast of denomination
[2:41:17] first corinthians 14 18 i thank my god
[2:41:22] that i've never spoke with tongues
[2:41:25] that sounds like a lot of message
[2:41:27] preachers today shame on you brothers
[2:41:30] i thank my god i spoke in tongues
[2:41:34] with more than you all
[2:41:38] i am grateful i am thankful
[2:41:41] i speak with tongues more than anybody
[2:41:46] yet
[2:41:46] in the church
[2:41:49] i would rather speak five words with my
[2:41:52] understanding
[2:41:54] that by my voice i might teach others
[2:41:57] also than ten thousand words in unknown
[2:41:59] time
[2:42:02] so what if my whole sermon this morning
[2:42:05] would have been just standing here
[2:42:06] speaking in the tongue you couldn't
[2:42:08] understand
[2:42:10] what good would it have done to you
[2:42:13] what prophet would you get he said i
[2:42:15] would rather have five words in the
[2:42:18] church
[2:42:19] in the church
[2:42:21] amen i'd rather speak five words with my
[2:42:24] understanding that by my voice i might
[2:42:26] be able to teach others
[2:42:28] but i speak with other tongues but it's
[2:42:30] more profitable for you
[2:42:32] that by my voice i preach to others in a
[2:42:35] known language
[2:42:36] than it would be for me to preach to
[2:42:38] speak ten thousand words in tongues
[2:42:41] so now did you know that in question
[2:42:43] answer 64
[2:42:45] that brother branham actually encouraged
[2:42:48] people
[2:42:50] to pray
[2:42:52] until they spoke in tongues
[2:42:59] about speaking in tongues he said
[2:43:02] he spoke of a person a genuine person a
[2:43:05] real person and they lived right
[2:43:08] a person that was living right they're
[2:43:10] genuine a real person
[2:43:12] and they've heard me say the evidence of
[2:43:14] the holy ghost wasn't speaking tongues
[2:43:15] and it isn't
[2:43:17] but i advise that person
[2:43:20] to ask god to let them either speak in
[2:43:23] tongues or prophesy because it's the
[2:43:26] nature they needed he saw in them a need
[2:43:30] to have something supernatural happen to
[2:43:32] them
[2:43:33] to where they spoke in tongues
[2:43:38] and he says now
[2:43:40] i believe this now i do not believe
[2:43:42] speaking in tongues there's any evidence
[2:43:44] the holy ghost it isn't because i see
[2:43:46] witches wizards snake handlers devils
[2:43:48] everything else speaking thugs it's not
[2:43:50] an infallible act of god when you speak
[2:43:52] in tongues when that you got the holy
[2:43:54] ghost but remember the holy ghost does
[2:43:56] speak in tongues and the devil can
[2:43:58] impersonate it
[2:44:00] and the evide the evidence you've got
[2:44:01] the holy ghost is the life you live by
[2:44:03] the fruits you know them and the kind of
[2:44:05] fruits of the spirit not somewhere not
[2:44:07] uh
[2:44:08] is not nowhere in the scripture found
[2:44:10] speaking in tongues the fruit of spirits
[2:44:11] love joy
[2:44:12] faith long suffering goodness meekness
[2:44:14] gentleness patience now that's the
[2:44:16] fruits now you find that on the tree to
[2:44:18] find what tree is and he said you
[2:44:19] ministers men are looking you preachers
[2:44:21] you deacons you trustees you're
[2:44:23] evangelists you could speak in tongues
[2:44:26] out on this street all day long they'd
[2:44:27] never believe you but what but you live
[2:44:30] what you're talking about you sow
[2:44:32] sweetness all the roots of bitterness
[2:44:34] out of you that men realize there's
[2:44:36] something about you
[2:44:41] speaking of tongues now i believe this
[2:44:43] again question answers this is 61
[2:44:46] i believe this that sometime another
[2:44:50] that a spirit-filled person
[2:44:53] that lays under the altar of god will
[2:44:57] speak
[2:44:58] with tongues
[2:45:02] what
[2:45:03] brother branham said this
[2:45:06] i've seen many speak with tongues that
[2:45:08] never knew nothing about god they know
[2:45:09] nothing about him all and they still
[2:45:11] speak with tongues any gift can be
[2:45:12] impersonated but the fruit of the spirit
[2:45:15] proves what the spirit is on side you
[2:45:17] bear witness of the life of jesus christ
[2:45:19] because there are peach trees snapping
[2:45:21] the apple tree it'll bear peaches
[2:45:22] through the world see because the light
[2:45:25] that's in it but now
[2:45:27] let's not get away from that now
[2:45:30] let me just not get away from that now
[2:45:32] because i don't want to dishonor a great
[2:45:34] gift god has given
[2:45:36] i believe that a spirit-filled man or
[2:45:38] woman or child that lives under the
[2:45:41] altar of god
[2:45:43] won't live there long until they'll be
[2:45:47] speaking in tongues
[2:45:50] now i believe he will do it or she now
[2:45:52] you can receive the holy ghost maybe you
[2:45:54] didn't speak with tongues when you get
[2:45:55] it but if you constantly lay there
[2:45:58] before god all the time
[2:46:01] with baptism after baptism striking you
[2:46:04] something's going to take place
[2:46:07] you get so full someday
[2:46:10] till you can't talk nothing else
[2:46:16] see you try to say something you just
[2:46:18] can't say it no more you you just can't
[2:46:20] say it many times if people just
[2:46:21] realized that was the holy ghost the
[2:46:23] holy spirit they'd go ahead and just
[2:46:25] open up their heart and let god speak to
[2:46:27] them
[2:46:27] the bible said with stammering lips
[2:46:29] another tongue well i speak to these
[2:46:31] people isaiah 28 18 with stamina lips
[2:46:34] other tongues will i speak what what is
[2:46:36] stammer someone who can't talk plain
[2:46:39] brother brandon may illustrate someone's
[2:46:41] stammering you just you're stammering
[2:46:42] you're just saying so full of the spirit
[2:46:44] you say like i was going to say brother
[2:46:45] jack
[2:46:46] jack
[2:46:47] brother jack brother jack jack jack
[2:46:49] jackson and it's like that you're trying
[2:46:51] to say it but you can't say it's so
[2:46:53] filled with the spirit and he said i
[2:46:54] want you to ask the brothers have you
[2:46:56] ever felt the holy ghost shake you so
[2:46:58] bad
[2:46:59] until you couldn't hardly say nothing
[2:47:02] and you would sit quiet sometime and
[2:47:04] just sit there and cry somebody raised
[2:47:06] their hand you ever have that amen
[2:47:10] well he said that's the holy ghost
[2:47:14] and the reason people don't speak with
[2:47:16] tongues many times they don't know how
[2:47:17] to yield to the spirit they're looking
[2:47:20] something for something way off when
[2:47:22] it's right on them
[2:47:25] and then some people just get themselves
[2:47:27] worked up in a motion and say a bunch of
[2:47:29] words has no meaning and still ain't got
[2:47:31] the holy ghost trying to say they spoke
[2:47:33] with that they have it because they
[2:47:34] spoke with tongues by their fruits you
[2:47:36] shall know them
[2:47:38] so you see if you'll lay under the altar
[2:47:41] of god long enough
[2:47:45] what's the matter with a lot of message
[2:47:47] people they ain't never laid under the
[2:47:48] altar of god
[2:47:51] they let the holy ghost strike them time
[2:47:53] after time after time until it took over
[2:47:56] it shook them so bad he said they shake
[2:47:59] until they just sit there and cry and
[2:48:01] he'd say if you knew how to heal that if
[2:48:04] you just yield to it
[2:48:06] amen it would come out of you in another
[2:48:09] language because that's what god does
[2:48:12] it's a sign that follows believers
[2:48:15] believers do this
[2:48:20] oh
[2:48:21] we got the perfect word now so speaking
[2:48:23] in tongues is over well how could
[2:48:25] speaking in tongues be over
[2:48:28] that would mean mark 16 and the great
[2:48:31] commission is over
[2:48:34] that signs no follow no longer follow
[2:48:36] them that believe
[2:48:38] that we will speak with new tongues
[2:48:41] i say nice try satan
[2:48:45] nice try
[2:48:46] trying to slip in
[2:48:48] you're so afraid of being a zeus of
[2:48:50] pentecostal
[2:48:52] that you become candlelight baptist
[2:48:56] church of christ teaching's a
[2:48:58] denomination
[2:49:01] and teach that now we got the perfect
[2:49:03] word the entire complete canon of the
[2:49:05] bible
[2:49:06] so now the great commission is of march
[2:49:08] 16 the apostolic age is over and this
[2:49:12] was what brother branham was opposed
[2:49:14] over and over and over again
[2:49:18] even to the last of his ministry he's
[2:49:21] still defending the great commission
[2:49:25] and saying we have not achieved it
[2:49:30] and he tells us if the seals are open
[2:49:33] it's only to them people that can finish
[2:49:35] it
[2:49:38] so you don't just see we're right back
[2:49:40] where eve was at the beginning where the
[2:49:41] full word has been restored and now what
[2:49:45] are we going to do with it
[2:49:48] we must let the word go through us
[2:49:50] because we become the word when we let
[2:49:53] it flow through us
[2:49:55] nobody can become that word of concern
[2:49:58] and speaking in tongues until they let
[2:50:00] it flow through them
[2:50:01] nobody can become that of mark 16 of
[2:50:04] laying hands on the sick and they
[2:50:06] recovered till they let it flow through
[2:50:07] them
[2:50:08] it's got to flow through the journey and
[2:50:10] when it flows through then you become
[2:50:12] that word
[2:50:14] you see now that's what's happening
[2:50:16] instead of instead of receiving the
[2:50:18] whole word then we become guilty of
[2:50:22] accepting the word of a denomination
[2:50:25] a candlelight teaching
[2:50:28] a hybrid word
[2:50:31] that causes a short and blows a fuse
[2:50:34] how by quenching the spirit
[2:50:37] by despising prophecy
[2:50:40] by throwing a wet blanket on worship
[2:50:43] by saying the days of miracles are past
[2:50:46] because we're in another season now
[2:50:49] i'm calling him message preachers by the
[2:50:51] way
[2:50:52] by saying john 14 12 was only for
[2:50:55] brother branham
[2:50:58] by saying we got the word now and we
[2:51:00] don't need an experience
[2:51:03] and the the message community is exactly
[2:51:07] in laodicea
[2:51:09] and they are becoming as guilty
[2:51:12] of refusing christ's entrance
[2:51:15] as any of the denominations
[2:51:19] they're rejecting the word which is the
[2:51:21] evidence the holy ghost is not there
[2:51:25] to deny one word of this bible
[2:51:29] shows the holy ghost is not there
[2:51:34] amen
[2:51:35] but when you can get the current to flow
[2:51:37] right through
[2:51:38] it'll produce healing miracles signs
[2:51:41] wonders every promise of the bible
[2:51:44] amen a people who's gonna
[2:51:46] who is going to express christ in the
[2:51:49] fullness of his godhead do you see this
[2:51:52] is where shall shout out come i am
[2:51:55] almighty god i am the omnipotence of god
[2:51:58] i am god in all power i am all that he
[2:52:01] is
[2:52:02] and i am your shield
[2:52:05] and your exceeding great reward
[2:52:11] and i want you to show your mind by
[2:52:14] letting me circumcise your life
[2:52:18] cut the unbelief

[2:55:46] they would surrender themselves to have
[2:55:49] the secret parts of their lives the
[2:55:52] excess cutaway
[2:55:55] this is what the new birth entails is
[2:55:58] when you come to god and you let you let
[2:56:01] him come in the secret parts
[2:56:03] that thing that wants to hold on to a
[2:56:05] grudge that thing that holds on to this
[2:56:07] habit that thing that holds on to the
[2:56:09] world that thing that has the wrong
[2:56:11] desire surrender that him let him just
[2:56:13] cut it off
[2:56:17] that says you're mine

[3:20:30] praise the lord everybody
[3:20:32] this is sister johnny mayo who is coming
[3:20:35] to be baptized in the name of the lord
[3:20:38] jesus christ
[3:20:39] what a privilege it is today to be able
[3:20:42] to represent the lord
[3:20:44] and to know that this uh this is so true
[3:20:47] you know i can only baptize
[3:20:50] with water but the one coming after me
[3:20:52] will baptize with the holy ghost and
[3:20:54] fire amen and that is
[3:20:58] the spirit giver and so we're here today
[3:21:00] to obey the lord and water baptism taken
[3:21:04] on the name of jesus
[3:21:06] this is part of our covenant with him
[3:21:08] that we we take on his name because we
[3:21:12] are his child and as his child
[3:21:15] we will walk as new creatures and
[3:21:18] creations in the in the newness of life
[3:21:21] so it's a joy today to be able to come
[3:21:24] and knowing this
[3:21:25] sister johnny has repented of her sins
[3:21:28] he's been serving the lord and she's
[3:21:30] been baptized but today she wants to
[3:21:34] you know sometimes it's uh the bible
[3:21:36] says that and peter said that baptism
[3:21:39] does now save us
[3:21:42] not in putting away the filth of the
[3:21:43] flesh
[3:21:45] but in the answer of a good conscience
[3:21:47] toward god
[3:21:49] and this is why our sister comes she
[3:21:51] wants to have that just nothing between
[3:21:55] my soul and the savior that's why her
[3:21:58] brother's coming he's one that
[3:22:00] just to declare i don't nothing no
[3:22:03] questions i don't know trouble at the
[3:22:06] river when it comes to crossing over i
[3:22:08] want to make sure everything is right
[3:22:11] so today we're we've come and we're
[3:22:13] going to obey the lord in water baptism
[3:22:16] and we're going to call on the name of
[3:22:18] the lord let me have your other hand
[3:22:19] right there
[3:22:20] right there as we just call on the name
[3:22:23] of the lord the bible said that it that
[3:22:25] he he that calls on the name of the lord
[3:22:27] shall be saved
[3:22:29] so therefore we call on the name of the
[3:22:32] lord we invoke his name
[3:22:34] when we pray and then we invoke his name
[3:22:37] when we are baptized because we are by
[3:22:41] baptism
