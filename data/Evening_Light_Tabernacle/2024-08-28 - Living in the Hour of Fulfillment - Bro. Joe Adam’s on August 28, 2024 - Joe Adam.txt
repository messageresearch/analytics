Lord and just worship and fellowship Lord in the spirit of Truth for this hour we just Lord we commit this service to you now father in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles tonight we're going to learn we're going to look here in habca the Lord placed this thought on my heart tonight at the earlier part of last week and I was like well maybe I need a little bit more time studying on it a little bit more time studying on it a little bit more time studying on it but I couldn't get away from it so we're going to preach it to you tonight I want to speak to you on living in the hour of fulfillment living in the hour of fulfillment and tonight is I will not get through everything tonight but I my my goal and my intentions is to take tonight as a foundation message for Sunday and possibly a couple other services I believe brother Aaron and I will be splitting up some services in September and October so we have plenty of time for that but for some you older Saints this will be a refresher amen all right so don't check out on me don't hang up you just say Amen to the word uh because we're going to come out of scripture we're going to come out of the the message but I believe that it's very pertinent for us to help anchor our young people in the faith why we believe what we believe and recognize that what we believe is going to come into fulfillment and so tonight is going to be that night so we look here in habca 2 verse 2 it says and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain make it plain what upon tables that that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and lie not though it t wait for it come on even light wait for it though it ter wait for it because it will surely come it will not t God bless you you can have your seats tonight and we'll just kind of go through this and so we find here that habac had raised a question in chapter one and he's seeing all the destruction all that's going on to Israel in habca 1 and verse 17 habca asked the Lord a question shall they therefore empty their net and not spare continually to slay the Nations otherwise you know like fishermen they cast out their they bring in the fish they clean it all out and they cast it back in and they do the same thing over and over and over and over so he's asking the Lord shall these Chans when they have conquered one nation and they filled their Nets and themselves they' they've gotten those spoil They Carried to the city of Babylon and there they lay it up and they come back and they throw their net out again they go and they plunder another Nation another kingdom and he's asking how long shall this happen and notice the Lord tells habca but it's not in everyday English probably wasn't in English at all that's right let's just be honest but we find here in habca to the Lord answered me and he said write the vision so when the Lord responded to habca he responded with that vision and so we find here the answer comes to an Vision through a a a revelation of God it was not only for Hab backa but it was for the people of God so we look at this and notice now he was committ mission to write the vision down don't make it a mystery but make it plain make it plain so he that runneth he can take that word or he can take the vision and he can run with it now that's not physically getting out and running with it the word run there means to announced by the divine revelation so he is going to run with this Vision he's going to go and forell and he's going to give forth the Revelation and here we find habca is being given this answer he said write this Vision down make it plain why did he need to write it down because it was for an appointed time there you go otherwise don't lose sight of this Vision it's going to come to pass though it t it will speak and so we find here God is bringing these things down and he said it must be recorded and it must be made plain and we find that being exemplified in Deuteronomy 27:8 it says says and thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly so God is doing something great so we find here tonight the message was so important that it couldn't be misunderstood it had to be made plain it had to be written so that we can take the vision take the message and run with it and declare the divine revelation notice it's it's a message of joy for the people of Israel after all notice the downfall of the enemy means Deliverance to Israel so when they see this and it's being made known if you go back in habca and you read down the verses four on down through the end of the chapter you will see what God is telling them he's going to do that's right but we want to look at tonight for the sake of building a foundation for our next fever several services and mainly I want you young people to really clue in here because I believe this is going to help you tonight but we look in habca 2 and the Lord answered me and it said write the vision so first of all we must understand what is a vision now this word vision is prophecy it means a Divine communication that is a dream a revelation or an oracle right yes Proverbs 29 and verse 18 says where there is no vision where there is no prophecy where there is no Divine communication where there is no dream where there is no Revelation where there is no orle of God the people perish now you think well they go to they perish they they die but it doesn't necessarily mean they perish and die it means they return naked they become naked they were without restraints yeah look Church look around in the society in which we're living in today man there's a people today that refuse the prophecy they refuse the vision and we find the people that are walking in darkness and they don't even know that they're naked but he says in Amos 3 and: 7 God has a pattern that he can never break that's right God has a pattern Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing but what he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets so I'm going to spend the rest of Wednesday night dealing with the office of a prophet yes sir cuz to me it's to Crut of our message and to every one of us if we have a prophet who is proclaiming a self-proclaimed prophet and what he prophesies doesn't come to pass then we're most miserable people but as we're going to find tonight through the scripture and through the message we're going to find why we need a prophet why God has always ordained a prophet because the Bible says surely the Lord God would do nothing otherwise he's not going to deal with the people he's not going to deal with the church he's not going to deal with the na but what he first Reveals His Secrets unto the prophets and notice I want you to understand this before they can be an end time good Lord wake up tonight and realize we're in the end time before there can be an end time before there can be a return of Christ God has to send a prophetic message and a prophet messenger notice he sent Elijah John the Baptist before his first coming and therefore if the pattern Remains the Same he has to send another Prophet before his second coming and we find here in Malachi 3 and verse1 behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek you shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom you Delight in behold he shall come sayeth the Lord of host so we know that this scripture has already been fulfilled Amen in John the Baptist we find in Matthew 11 Jesus referring to it he says Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John what went you out into the Wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind but went you out to see a man clothing soft rment behold they that wear soft clothing are in King's houses but what went you out to see a prophet yay notice I say unto you more than a prophet so he decare John was more than a prophet why because he was declaring the coming of the Lord notice the office in which John held was a very special office it was unlike any other prophets before him because he was now for running the first coming of our Messiah of Jesus Christ notice and he says verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there are there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist not withstanding he he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he so John fulfilled the scriptures regarding Jesus's first coming he was the voice of one that was crying in the wilderness and we know that God doesn't change his pattern because he says here oh Israel I'm the Lord thy God I change not now we spoke about that last time I I spoke Wednesday night the previous Wednesday how God doesn't change and we looked at it from the aspect of the supernatural to signs and wonders and miracles and and all those things but it also applies to the word itself so God can't break his own word he can't break his own pattern whatever God did in the beginning God has to continue down into the consummation right so we find if he had a a a prophet forerun his first coming of Christ then he's going to have to send another Forerunner that's going to forrun his second coming of Christ and if he was under the spirit of Elijah and the first coming then the second coming there was going to be a prophet with this Same Spirit of Elijah and we look here in Malachi 4 and I know this is very familiar with us Malachi 4:1 says for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven that didn't happen in Malachi 3 the world didn't burn over in John the Baptist he just had his head taken off and Jesus died on the cross but the world was never burned over but Church we're closer to that day just now brother Wayne sent something out this morning that Russia has threatened nuclear war upon the United States if they continue to meddle with the Ukraine war we're that close to the hour of complete fulfillment that's right and what I want to talk I'm not trying to scare you tonight this is a happy moment for us because this is what we've been believing for this is what we've been waiting on we've been waiting we're that close to stepp into a new body we're that close to stepping into the Rapture and be at the wedding supper of the Lamb we're that close to the hour of fulfillment and we're the people people living in it we're the people living in the hour of fulfillment look prophets and great men had longed to be in this day that they can see the manifestation of all the scriptures be made known in a body and you are that body and we are that people I say hallelujah tonight what a bride what a people we are to be living in the hour of fulfillment woo to be living in I know it's tough out there I know the world stuff but we're not looking at the world look the brother the prophet of God would say this you're always looking to say how bad the world is he said but you fail to see how strong the church is getting all the time oh messes after message we're putting on strength word after word we're putting on strength while we're getting stronger what preparing a body change but behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud man there's a bunch of proud people in the land today y all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts that it shall lead them neither root nor Branch so we understand that was not the first coming of Elijah or the second coming of Elijah in the me in the ministry of John the Baptist but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing and his wings and he shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the SES of your feet in the day that I do this sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him and horb for all of Israel with the statutes and judgments behold now this is our message behold I send you so the message was never about a lie go the message has never been about a prophet all that he could be all that he was going to be but it says behold I send you the message has always been about you about God getting you ready to receive a body change getting you ready to dress you in the Robes of his righteousness to dress you in the the Vindicated word of the hour so that you can be ready for that day this day that he's talking about he's going to have a people that's going to come back and walk out on the ashes of the wicked we are that people Church we're the ones that's going to step out on the ashes of the wicked when it's been burnt over woo my my my I tell you what you better get ready better make sure your heart's right notice behold I send you Elijah the prophet he's a prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord and He Shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse now the church age book brother B says this so immediately after the coming of this Elijah the Earth will be cleansed by fire and the wicked burn to ashes of course this did not happen at the time of John the Elijah of his day the spirit of God that prophesied the coming of the messenger in Malachi 3 John but was reiterating his previous prophetic statement of Isaiah 40:3 made at least three centuries previously he said the voice of him that crith in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord straight in the desert highway of our God or make straight in the desert a highway for our God but John by the Holy Ghost voiced both Isaiah and Malachi in Matthew 3:3 for this is he that was spoken of by Elias the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord make his path straight so we can well see from these scriptures that the prophet of Malachi 3 was John was not the prophet of Malachi 4 though indeed both John and this last day Prophet have upon them the same Spirit which was upon Elijah and he goes on he says now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi four is going to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers come on Church why are you here tonight come on why are you here tonight because your hearts have been turned all right that's part of the Fulfillment somebody's living in the hour of fulfillment things have already taken place we're already fulfilling the scriptures regarding the the Bride of Jesus Christ notice and know he'll do two things he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers number two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers so how many of us can say that that scripture Malachi 4 5 and 6 has been fulfilled now the way you say that it's been fulfilled is because your heart been turned if your heart's not been turned yet you can't say you can't answer that it's been fulfilled but those that have their hearts turned back to the faith of what of the Pentecostal fathers of what he did in the upper room he's still the same doing it the same today God doesn't break the pattern he stays with his word notice he has to come and perform the word that was a lowed for him to fulfill so here we are today our hearts have been turned turned away from sin turned away from just religious organization denominational beliefs our hearts have been turned back to the original Faith the original faith not some fictitious not some put on not some man-made intellectual understanding of Faith but the original faith that was once delivered to the Saints our hearts have been turned back to that yes sir am notice in the Elijah 4 will be like the Elijah of old the Elijah of Malachi 4 will be like the Elijah of old he will not compromise on the word he will call right right and wrong wrong and he will be a prophet so that's why I want to deal with that subject tonight is a prophet notice in Hebrews 1 and verse one God who at sundri times and in divers manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets so God has a way of breaking himself known God has always used a prophet let me just say this and we understand that the English word for Prophet today is Minister preacher and so God still has a way of making his word relevant for the generation in which we're living in and he does it through anointed Ministry and when they're ministering it's a prophecy going forth It's a revelation of God going forth to the people but brother says in modern events made clear if you hadn't listened to that message in a long time I believe it'll do you some good to go back and listen to it because I started looking at it going from I mean I went I've covered a lot of ground this past week woo uh but you look at modern events made clear by what prophecy that's right so you look back at the prophecy then you look at the Modern events you can understand the modern events and they're made clear because we can look back because we had a Vindicated voice tell us what to look for he told us what these things me mean and because we can see what they mean now we see the manifestation or the Fulfillment they're made clear to us they're not clear to everybody they're not clear to the Baptist they're not clear to the Catholic they're not clear to the the Buddhist they're not clear to the the Hindus and all these different other forms of religion but they are clear to the elect Jesus of Jesus Christ The Bride of Jesus Christ the word of God is made known and clear to them let me keep going now he says Hebrews 1 the Bible said God in Sundry times that's old times and in diverse manners wrote the Bible by prophets he wrote the Bible by his own chosen way well I didn't like the way God did that well you know what you don't have a say in it nor do I see he didn't have to write it that way neither notice he says neither did he have to save Man by Blood he didn't have to preach the gospel by man he could have let the Sun or the moon or the Stars preach PR the gospel he could have let the winds hum the gospel but he chose man and he chose the way his word came and that was by His prophets which were predestinated and for ordained being a part of God's word declaring the revelation of his word to the age at the time for the word of God comes to the prophet only never does it come to a theologian never does it come to a theologian so tonight you can rest assure I'm not a theologian now I'm not declaring I'm a prophet either but thank God I'm not a theologian but notice it comes only to prophets the word of God the inspired word only comes to prophets God cannot lie so God wrote the Bible by his chosen method and his own chosen proph or his own chosen prophets not the prophets man had chose but the prophets God had chose and there's a pattern model Vince made clear he keeps going he says now then it's Believers he says then it's the Believers they watch for the Fulfillment of what their Prophet said that's right that's one thing well bless God I believe God sent a prophet bless God I believe brother Brown's Revelations 10:7 but what are you watching for what are you looking for you just believe in that because we're sheep and we believe stuff that we just automatically he because we're going to get into some of that later about how our Society uses propaganda against us but today we don't we're not saying that what I'm speaking as propaganda but we're saying when we received a Vindicated voice we're to be looking for the Fulfillment of what he's prophesying that's right and so then brother B tells us in modern events made clear then it's believers they watch for the Fulfillment of their Pro what their Prophet says and that's the identification that they are God's prophets so the Fulfillment of the scripture or what they're prophesying is the Vindication that they are sent from God they're not sent from a seminary they're not sent by mama called them and sent them they ain't sent by man's idea but they're sent by God Almighty that's right he says now because first they're inspired next they stay exactly with the word of the hour then that's his credentials see the world the people are watching for some little Outlet some little bypass some little shortcut but there is no shortcuts in the word of God notice there's one pattern one pattern he goes you must cut yourself and fit that pattern not try to cut the pattern to fit you everybody must do that that's the only way God has of doing it the pattern has to fit you not you fit the pattern right then he says now the believer is wait for that word to be confirmed see it was not wrote by man but by by the Lord God therefore it's not a book of man now he's talking about the Bible this is not a book of man somebody said well it's just some old Hebrew writings they would write the Hebrew write the letter that condemn brother M says now would the Hebrews write a letter that condemn themselves that's like you writing your in your diary and saying all the bad things you did today you don't want nobody to know your bad things if you're smart I'm hopefully I'm dealing with some smart people tonight not a bunch of dummies I'm going to write all this up so I can just you know crucify myself anybody finds this man they got me but no he says would the Hebrews write a letter that condemned themselves would that fine nation of Jews self stouted and Polished would they write their own iniquities condemning them own their own selves certainly not tell of his own sins how they went into ulry and how they committed fornications against God's word no no he says they would never tell that that proud Nation it's not a man's book it's it's a book of god notice and the man who sees the Visions or hears from the voice of God they never understand it many times themselves in many cases they they don't even understand it they just write it see man didn't write the Bible God wrote the Bible it's God thoughts expressed through human lips that's what makes it the Bible a thought expresses a word in the beginning was uh in the beginning was God's thinking he expressed it through the lips of His prophets and confirmed it by his servants so God does his own choosing that's right and thank God he doesn't choose the way we choose based on height or lack thereof based on looks thank God woo based on hair woo yeah yeah that's right brother L me and you buddy we got it God doesn't choose based on the outward appearance of man God chose you because you were in the thoughts of God and brother says now God does his own choosing by predestination chose the prophets for every age notice it now he fixes the nature of that Prophet to fit that age he fix fits the nature of that Prophet to fit that age see he fits his style whatever he does he fits him whether he's educated or Not educated he fits the gifts the manner in that he'll preach in the gifts he'll have and the message for that certain age God's predestinated that certain thing to happen and there's not another thing that can take its place see he predestinated a man maybe an ignorant man now look at we're our prophets a seventh grade educated Kian now I ain't slamming Kentucky people but seventh grade is not a high education no matter what state you're in but nevertheless when we dig into the messages of God go listen to the uh 70 weeks of Daniel blow your mind yeah I mean come on Christ The Mystery of God revealed go look at some of these listen to them and read them and wonder how in the world can a seventh grade educated man preach these deep thoughts of God because it's not his thoughts he's a Vindicated Prophet therefore he must speak what God shows him and declares and it's not for him but it's for the age and he fits that Prophet messenger for the age and the message for the certain age God predestinated that certain thing to happen and there's not another thing that can take his place he predestinated the man may be ignorant man he might not have predestinated him another kind of man whatever he is he gives him his class his gift his nature his style whatever it is how he expresses himself and whatever he does he makes the man of the hour to catch the people of the hour Hallelujah and God still does that today in the 5f ministry now people want you to stop having the fivefold push playing you know what I'm all about out push and play push it in your car push it in your home push it wherever you are but when you come to the house of God God's ordained a way he chose a way to make his word known to the people and I believe he fits the gifts that he placed here and even like Tabernacle to catch the people my gift may catch the young it may catch some of the old brother A's gift may catch some that I don't catch brother Tim may catch some that we don't catch but God he he directed The gift and he formed that gift to catch the people of the age what am I telling you we're are blessed people because God is not going to allow one of us to not be caught he's going to let the gifts that he put in this church to shape you and to mold you and prepare you and get you ready for the coming of the Lord God fits the gifts brother Aaron my makes the man of the hour to catch the people of the hour mama that's me I done been caught Hallelujah hallu I said I don't been caught glory to God there ain't a day I don't wake up and say God thank you for this message thank you for the prophet thank you for showing me who I am look I come out of sin I come out of denomination I come out of all that but I never was in it to begin with CU in the mind of God he saw me believing this and he sent a message and he sent a man and he had a gift and he caught me because I was part of the people of that age oh hallelujah hallelujah notice and at the end of the age y'all need to turn that clock around I got a long ways to go I'm like smoking the Bandit long ways to go I'm got a short time to get there at the end of each age when the church has turned to the world and sin and the Leaning upon man's interpretation of the word as ever there always at the end of the age he says have got it such a mess by the theologians and Priests until it's always messed up always their interpretation is wrong not one time has it ever failed to be wrong that's right he's talking about the the great theologians and he said their interpretation of the word has never failed but to be wrong every time and they he says and not one time has God's word ever failed but to be right because heavens and earth will pass away but my word let me tell you let every man's word be alive but stay with the word of God it's been Vindicated let me tell and it's being fulfilled Hallelujah brother B says in the church AG said this Prophet this Prophet Messenger will be in his nature and manners as were Elijah and John the people of of this Pro Prophet messenger's day will be as they were in ahab's day and in John's and since it's only the children whose Hearts will be turned it's only the children who will listen amen so wonder why some of your family members don't catch it cuz it's only for the children oh come on man that sh look you may have drug and sad and mully Grub today but to realize you caught it yes or it's caught you it's showing you it's placing you it's not for everybody but it's for the elect no he says in the days of Ahab only 7,000 true SE the Israelites were found in the days of John there was also very few the masses in both Ages were in fornication and idolatry look at the churches look at the people look at the society look at the world in which we're living in fornication idolatry sin but he goes I want to make one more comparison between the leot de and Prophet messenger and John the prophet messenger who preceded jesus' first coming the people in John's day mistook him for messiah there you go I want y'all to listen now John 1 19-20 and this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he confessed and denied not but confess I am not the Christ now this last day Prophet Messenger will have such power before the Lord that there will be those who mistake him for the Lord Jesus oh my have we not seen that manifest when Paul there on the out the the the island there I me can't remember just read it in Ro uh in Romans just said they when he shook off the Viper and they fell down to worship Paul Paul's like no no no no no don't worship me I'm just a man that's right and any God called God centered real genuine Son of God whether he's gifted in whatever area he's gifted in he's not going to allow people to elevate him to a place that he doesn't belong because notice he's just one of the prophets he's not Christ but yet men were baptizing in the prophet's name men considered him and they still do today as being the Messiah we call it a deity spirit and it's very much alive in our day but notice now this last day excuse me this last day Prophet Messenger will have such power before the Lord that there will be those who mistake him for the Lord Jesus there will there will be a spirit in the world at the end time that will seduce some and make them believe this notice is at the end time amen seduce those to make them believe it Matthew 242 24 and and through 26 for there shall arise false Christ false prophets and they shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chamber believe it not he says but but don't you believe it he says now listen he is not Jesus Christ he is not the Son of God he is one of the Brethren that's right a prophet a messenger a servant of God he needs no greater honor bestowed upon him than that which John received when he was the voice that cried I am not he but I'm the one that he's coming after me right and see if the prophet was alive today I believe he would be sharing these same sentiments with these that are elevating him to the office of a of God that's right so let's let's can we go yeah we got plenty of time so let's look at this what is a prophet brother Joe good I'm glad you asked a very intriguing question brother B says now a prophet he's a Seer a vision Seer a prophet whatever you want to call it he said a prophet is a compound word just like sanctification is a compound word which means clean and set aside for service and there's as many words and especially in our English words are compound but a prophet means to give a personal experience under inspiration or foresee something right so I'm going to take the next little while and we're going to break down every place scripture and message where brother B describes a prophet yes because remember that's the crutch of our message Malachi 4 has to be Elijah the prophet that's right our hearts have to be turned that's right and it takes a prophet it takes a man with a prophetic gift gift not just any prophetic gift but a a genuine a a genuine gift of a major prophet to turn the heart of the people not a minor Prophet but a major prophet to turn the hearts of the people back to the faith he says now there's a difference between the gift a prophecy and a prophet yes sir one is a gift of Prophecy the other one is a prophet a gift of Prophecy must be judged by two or three spiritual men so somebody stands up brother L you stand up don't do it right now please but and you give a prophecy it can't come before the church but what is first judged by two or three and brother B says it needs to be done in the back office so a gift of Prophecy has to be judged but a prophet doesn't have to be judged doesn't have to go before the people because he is the Divine revealer of the thoughts of God so notice a gift of Prophecy must be judged by two or three spiritual men he said It Came Upon one person tonight to be another person tomorrow night and another one the next night what is it is a gift and and he says it's a gift in every local body every church but a prophet is different they're born to Prophet they come up prophets all that they say must be true every time it cannot be recognized or or it cannot be recognized as a prophet in the office or or so it's got to be true every time or cannot be recognized in the office and brother M says notice here in the impersonation of a Christianity he said a prophet is a sear and he's referred to in the Bible as an eagle he goes way high in the air higher you go the further you see see I'm at a disadvantage why you laugh out loud sorry my goodness why you look at me when you say short but you take somebody like brother Aaron stature he's got me by an inch maybe inch and a half something like that but he can see farther don't mean he got better eyes just means he's higher up he can see farther and so he's saying now this eagle and he Compares his profets to Eagles because so the eagle sword is much higher than any other bird there's no bird can go with the eagle there's no eye like the eagle the Hulk hasn't got a chance in his sight the Hulk could he could not stand at the the altitude of where the eagle can soar he would die he doesn't he hasn't got the makeup that the eagle has and he says now an eagle he can go way high until he can see things that other birds can't see because he's higher and God is making the eagle made him for that purpose because his nest is higher than others his little ones is up in the nest but they feed on the ground so in order to see the storm or the trouble coming the eagle must survive he must go higher so that he can protect his little ones so aren't you thankful God sent you a prophet that could raise up a little bit higher are way higher than the denominations that they don't know what's coming they don't man they got planes coming falling out of the sky trains running off the road cars running off the road and they saying this is what it's going to be like in the end time we know that's not going to fit the pattern because we had a prophet Eagle raise up there and he prophesied and he showed us the things that are made clear modern events by prophecy that's right we don't have to fear young people we don't have to fear Mom and Dad we don't have to fear grandparents because why because we had a Prophet come and he's telling you this is what's coming but when he comes look up cuz your Redemption is drawing n be ready be prepared this is what it's going to be like but I want you to know when it gets in that condition when the hour of fulfillment comes to manifestation I'll come to snatch you out of hereo Mercy man what a people we [Applause] are God liking his Prophet to Eagle that would go in go in the mar the makeup of a prophet he's a Seer that in the spirit he clowns Beyond notice I like this he clowns beyond the emotion of the church he goes beyond the rhythm of Music he goes beyond the Clapping of hands he goes beyond the joy among Saints he goes beyond all that God brings him up into the real alone then he opens his eyes and he lets him look around and he see things that is to come he ain't based on emotion it ain't based on the music it ain't based on friendships it ain't based on the Clapping of hands it ain't based on the joy of the Saints but God lifts his Prophet up alone and lets him see things that are coming upon the Earth amen wooo he can bring them back down notice he takes them there so he can see things that are to come then he brings them back down among the members of the body to forell them of what what it is in the making so God that Prophet lifts up see things coming and he comes back down and he shares it to establish you on the faith so you don't have fear you don't have questions you don't have unbelief he establish you on the solid Ro revelation of the word of God and another place brother says now a prophet is also a gift of knowledge a knowledge is like an attorney who studies the books and I tell you you go look in the back of the message program and you see the books that your Prophet read yeah I mean you got to be a theologian to read some of those books but God anointed him to go in there and see what the spirit of man saw and pull out the Loose Ends of that so he can tie those things up and bring it all together for an end time people so notice he studies the books and when you go to hire an attorney to plead your case he's only taking what he knows and you're paying for what he knows to present your case before the judge and the gift of knowledge in the Bible is a prophecy which goes up finds out these things are to come and bring brings them back down but they must compare with the Bible with the book if they're not out of the book goes if they're out of the book then they're not received because the the judge judges by the book then the word that God has spoken before the foundation of the world it isn't that God speaks and says something to the prophet at that time I want you to get this now it's not that he speaks and says something to the prophet at that time it is that the prophet catches what God has already said so God lifts this Prophet up and he catches what's already been said and then he comes back down notice the prophet doesn't have his own interpretation of the word he's only saying what's already been [Applause] said oh my so the word he says then the word that God has spoken before the foundation of the world it isn't that God speaks and says something to the prophet at that time but he catch the prophet catches what God has already said for the word was before the foundation of the world God spoke the word and it's laying way out stretched out in time and the prophet goes up and he sees a Time coming so it's only of gift of knowledge that he brings down and puts it on paper now another place the revelation of Jesus Christ a prophet means a Divine interpreter of the word now I don't see you young people making any notes this is good stuff notice a prophet is the word we know that the word Prophet means a Divine interpreter of the word the Divine word is wrote and the prophet has a Divine spirit of God within him and you know the prophet in the Old Testament was called a God that's right how many many knew that maybe three or four of y'all Jesus said if they call them Gods it is it written by your law you are Gods if you call them Gods who the word of God came to the prophet how will you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God and Jesus here in John 10 he's quoting this to the Pharisees and Sadducees in John 10:34 Jesus answered him is it not written in your law that I said you are gods and in verse 35 and if he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came to and the scriptures cannot be broken so he's saying you call them Gods who the word of God came to so he was actually referring back to Exodus 7 and verse one and the Lord said unto Moses I have made thee a God to pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be a prophet therefore a prophet is a mouthpiece it's God's mouthpiece to the age that's right it's God's mouthpiece to the age so that means that you and all your great intellectual understanding and all your time reading the Bible he's the mouthpiece to the age you don't have any right any say to critique to go against what that Prophet messenger has brought because he's the mouthpiece he's done raised up caught the Revelation and bringing it down making it known it's not up for debate it's up for you to line up too and believe it that's right notice he says now there never was in any age any two Major Prophets on the earth at one time there were many Minor Prophets but there was one major prophet and Elijah was the prophet until Elisha came then when Elijah was taking off a portion a double portion of Elijah's Spirit Elijah's Spirit came back on Elijah so God only had one major prophet in any generation there never was two on the field at one time Elijah and Elisha walked arm in arm but he never become fully a prophet until Elijah's robe dropped upon him and a prophet is a man who's born and predestinated and for ordained for that generation the Bible teaches that that's right by God's forn knowledge he sent a certain person for that and we find the scripture for this because I want to Bas base everything on scripture right so we go to Jeremiah 1 and verse 5 and it says says before I formed thee in thy belly I knew thee you go and before thou camest forth out of thy womb I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations so in the forn knowledge of God Jeremiah was already ordained a prophet so he didn't just make himself a prophet he didn't just study enough to declare well know what I feel the call I think I'm going to preach no God ordained him a prophet that's right and so prophets are not man-made they're not just somebody thinking he's going to do something because he feels spiritual true prophets are ordained by God predestinated by the for knowledge of God to that office and there's only one major prophet to a generation that's right so all these men that's claiming they're the eighth messenger too late you done broke the scripture right because there's one major prophet to the age and according to the word of God he's going to be a Malachi 4 fulfillment and a revelation 107 fulfillment cuz he's going to do two things the prophet said he's going to turn the hearts of the elect back to the Pentecostal fathers and two he's going to reveal the Mysteries which is going to prepare us for a body change now brother B says now a prophet for sees way off the things that is coming he sees the cup of God's Wrath full before it his field he can say thus sayeth the Lord God will destroy this city except you repent why he's an eagle he rides way in y under he looks way off there and he sees that cup of the Wrath poured out see that's what the prophets looks at he ain't looking down here he's looking up yonder he's saying it's coming he can go so high till he can see that shade and the world will be dark and darkness and gross Darkness he's up high enough the Sun's shining now but he sees the shade coming he's saying what he's he's looking at he ain't here yet or it ain't here yet but it'll be here sure notice that's right it's going to be here gross Darkness upon the people he knows it's coming years away but yet he sees it Amos that anointed prophet of God he saw the darkness and the Judgment he seen Syria come down with their chariots and sweep through there and Slaughter the people out he saw it coming and the Judgment of God upon them now 50 years before it happened but you see being a prophet he was lifted up into the spirit and he saw it far off he saw the cup full before it ever was filled and that's what a prophet does he sees the cup of iniquity filled before it ever gets filled we're gonna keep going don't worry the word of God comes to a prophet if you call them gods and whom the word of God come to John 10:35 we also find here in 1 Corinthians 14:37 Paul speaking If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord so notice what Paul is saying here if he's a prophet if he's spiritual he's going to say the same thing that the preceding prophets already said because he can't say anything of his own because he's only saying what's already been said but he climbs up higher notice God always sends a prophet the word comes to the prophet the written word a discerner of the thoughts of the heart did you all he goes did you did you always notice he goes the prophet being that he know that he was a prophet is because that the word of God discerns the thoughts in the heart for tell things he's a fourth teller and a teller fourth did you ever take the dictionary the old Hebrew dictionary and see what the word sear means it's the one that has a divine revelation of the written word and how it's Vindicated he foresees things that he foretells and they come to pass so I will say this if the things that we believe have not come to pass then let's just shut the doors put the chains on and let's leave let's just go to some other church but what I'm preaching to you tonight is we're living in the hour of fulfillment the things that we believe we have seen with our own eyes in our own generation becoming part of that fulfillment we're seeing look brother Tim had sent a a quote out the other day or a question out to a lot of US minister the other day who's got the green Checker chirk oh come on wake up somebody recognize the day in which we're living somebody's got the green chcken shirt on we're living in the hour we're walking in division time is closing in but don't be fearful don't worry because in the moment you think not that's when he's coming and he's going to snatch his waiting R away because why she's not looking at man she's looking at the word constantly looking at the word looking at the prophecy looking at the vision oh let me tell you church when he said in habca he said you wait for it you wait for it in the end time it will speak otherwise it will manifest what I declare though it ter wait for it it will come to pass I said Oh Glory to God tonight at evenight Tabernacle we are a people that is looking to the vision and we're waiting for fulfillment and we're walking into the vision and we're walking into the Fulfillment of it we're living in that [Applause] day I don't want you to have any questions about this message you may have been sitting here for 25 30 years you may have just started coming six months ago but I don't want you to have any qualms any questions about this m it is Vindicated Vindicated by the scriptures it ain't Vindicated by man it's Vindicated by almighty God and that's why we're here because our hearts have been turned whether we're young whether we're old we met God and God snatched us out of this the life that we've been living and maybe you're here tonight and you're backl I'm here to tell you tonight you ain't got to stay in that condition there's been a word spoke there's been a prophecy spoke that the Sons and Daughters of God shall return home oh let me tell you Church in 1948 they came back to the Homeland for an AIA there's got to be a bride getting back in the homeland of the word for her aah and what happens first he sends a prophet divinely Vindicated numbers 12 and verse 6 can I keep going please I don't know how much more I got but I got to get it off my I got to get it done tonight so I can prepare for for you on Sunday numbers 12:6 and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will'll speak unto him in a dream oh my and brother B talks about this and I may get to it here in just a little bit he talked about how a prophet he never falls asleep completely but he's in his subconscious he's dreaming so he's seeing things and he's able to see addresses he's able to see names he's able to see things that the the common man never sees because his subconscious never sleeps he's awake when he's seeing these things he says now in his unfailing words of promise if there be one among you who is spiritual or a prophet I of the Lord will make myself known to him speak to him in visions and if these things come to pass then it's God if they don't come to pass then don't hear him don't don't fear him at all but just ignore it that's what I'm saying so if the things that we believe hasn't come to pass then we just K to Barrow the door and let's just go home but what I'm telling you church it's been Vindicated it's been over Vindicated we got no reason to doubt I know it's not the mainstream denominations but my goodness you go look at what's in some of those denominations what's preaching the message in those denominations we got homosexuals we got lesbians we got gays we got the doors of of Christ is on the outside of the church trying to get back in but he ain't going to get in because they won't let them in cuz LBG Q is going to kick them out and you say you don't believe the message of the hour you want to go to that Tommy Rod God has Vindicated this message right notice but God's word is always right therefore that's how that's how they knew the man that was speaking whether he had the right revelation of God or not the Divine word that's written is because he had the word of the Lord come to him and it's no different to than our day today if a prophecy is given and I'm just going to say if a gift of Prophecy is given in the church and it doesn't line up it doesn't come to pass bring the person up here and get the lion Spirit off of them but if it is a gift of Prophecy and it's judged by two or three and it does come to pass then we must hear it but B says when God makes a promise he fulfills it that's the interpretation thereof it comes to fulfillment he goes if I promise you that I'd be here tonight and I'm here that's fulfilling my promise if I say I'll meet you in the morning and I'm there that's my promise there ain't no need of making any other excuses I got to be there so when God makes a promise then he comes around and fulfills that promise that's the interpretation of the promise but notice there is a vast difference between the gift of Prophecy and a prophet and we're going to look here in 1 Corinthians 12 and verse4 we're going to look at these nine spiritual gifts that are being operation in every local assembly I'll try not to hold you too much longer but I'm going to get through with this tonight if that's okay now there are diversities in verse four there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit there's diversities of administrations but the same Lord there's diversities of operations but it's the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for to one is given the spirit of the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit and to another the working of Miracles and another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another divine or diverse kinds of tongues and to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the selfs Spirit dividing to all men severly as he will but we find the gift of a prophet we find that in Ephesians 4 and: 11 it's not a gift that operates among every local assembly right because it is a office not every Church notice Ephesians 4 ver 11 he gave some Apostles he gave some prophets some evangelists some pastors and some teachers for the perfecting of the body so not every local assembly will have an evangelist not every local assembly will have an apostle or a missionary one that's sent not every local assembly will have teachers and there you know what some of them don't even have pastors right but we find 1 Corinthians 12:4 all of these spiritual gifts are to be in every local assembly because it don't rest on officers men of God who call for those Stat or those places but God places the gifts in the body so there is a difference and brother B goes here now a prophet if you look that word up a prophet is a spokesman for another he's an interpreter for a deity a prophet he's a Seer so there's n spiritual gifts that operate through the body he goes now one one of them is a gift of knowledge gift of wisdom gift the tongues gift the interpretation all those things Gifts of Prophecy he goes but there's a vast difference between the gift of Prophecy and a prophet a gift of propety goes from one to another and before the church can even receive it it's got to be judged before three spiritual judges if it don't come to pass then it's wrong you got the wrong Spirit among you and he says now that's where the Pentecost people let down he goes I'm not to judge you he goes but you got Haywire on that you better watch them things that they absolutely be done decently in order and when the message goes hear it but them things have to be every word and they saying those gifts of prophec they have to be every word truth if it doesn't that person that goes to the altar get that evil spirit off them God don't don't lie God tells the truth then you have the church in order so we find here there's difference there God never change he always does it the same the coming of a prophet is a sign that God is ready to speak that's right God is ready to speak the Bible said God himself he did nothing until he revealed it Amos 3:7 to his servants the prophets that's right he does it through them because it comes to him that's his servants you know all right the coming of a prophet is a sign that's overlooked by the people every time so why are our message churches bigger than what they are because the prophets overlooked the prophets overlooked the office of a prophet is overlooked they may have their Bishops they may have their hierarchy in the church but the office of a Vindicated Prophet is overlooked because they claim God doesn't do that anymore right but you find in the old the New Testament even Jesus and Paul even speaks about the prophets in the New Testament so we understand though but let's keep going the coming of a prophet is a sign that's overlooked by the people every time they Overlook it they never get it let it's those who got their eyes open to see it so what makes you different than anybody else what makes you different than anybody else why can you receive the message of a prophet well some of you young people well we were just born into it no I'm trying to establish you on why we believe God's send a prophet because before God does anything and God is ever going to speak to a generation ever going to speak to a people he has to stay with the pattern therefore he must send a mouthpiece he must send a prophet yes sir and the coming of a prophet is a sign because it doesn't go with the nominations it doesn't go with the mainstream religious people cuz he's not going to line up he's only going to say what God puts in his mouth was that Micaiah where the spirit of God leave you know when it left me he I'm only going to say what the spirit of God tells me to say that's a Vindicated prophet he says now remember that he wouldn't be on the earth unless God was ready to speak and that's the way he speaks is through those channels the unchanging God never did do it any other way Hebrews 138 we put that off on the speaking in tongues and miracles and all that but God can't break the pattern of the scripture he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Malachi 3 for I am the Lord I change not and that word change there is disguise to diverse or to pervert he doesn't pervert he doesn't disguise he stays the same he stays with the original word pattern Hallelujah now a prophet is also a reflector of God some of you how many of y'all got mirrors in your house everybody should Bray their hands some of you should have looked at it before you came tonight just kidding just had to break the ice a little bit but you look in a Mir it's a reflector some of you go oh my yeah but some of you like mm I got it but it's a reflector it's showing exactly what's in the mirror and a prophet is a reflector of God so he's showing exactly what God is saying or catches that inspiration brother R says how many knows that a reflector doesn't reflect itself the reflector isn't the reflection there has to be something strike the reflector and the reflector to make it reflect and so what a prophet does he's not reflecting his own ideas he's not reflecting his own thoughts he's something has struck that Prophet just like something strikes a man of God today when he's preaching and he's studying God anoints him and strike something into his heart and what is he do to do he begins to study and God begins to pour out and he's reflecting to the people the thoughts of God so a prophet is a chosen vessel of God that cannot reflect nothing at all but he sees in a direct line with that reflection God to to reflect in the image of Christ word nothing else can do it you are a reflector that's the reason a prophet had to eat the book that's the reason he had to eat to scroll he had to reflect the word for that age and we jump over into Revelations 10 and verse 10 John saying I took the little book out of the Angel's hand I ate it up it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again thou must reflect what you ate John and John is a type of the bride therefore little bride tonight you got to take the book you got to take the vision you got to take the prophecy and eat it don't set it on the Shelf don't push PL and just leave it all all there at the church and you and you don't never have anything else no other anointed Ministry but you got to take that word and eat that word and reflect that word to the people your life is to be a reflection that God is alive it's got to be more than Wednesday night it's got to be more than Sunday morning it's got to be every wak and minute of every day that you live that the Lord Jesus is reflecting himself from our Lives why because we ate the book yes sir we can't help but bear forth the contents of the book the contents are manifest and a prophet is a reflector of God he's made so that he cannot speak his own words it has to be God's word that he speaks he's just like a a reflector and he is God's mouthpiece notice but in the days of the voice Revelations 10:7 another one of our famous famous famous scriptures in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when they shall begin to sound when she shall begin to sound notice it's to he when he shall begin to sound but saying it's singular one Prophet major prophet per generation he doesn't deal with man he deals with one and he says she it's not a she it's not a propheus but it's a he he's a prophet the first he says now first this age will have one prophet he talking about the leoty and church age now this we have one Prophet messenger Revelation 10:7 when he singer shall begin to sound there's never been any other age where God gave his people two Major Prophets at a time he gave Enoch alone he gave Noah alone he gave Moses alone alone they had the word through the others proph though the others prophesied John the Baptist came alone hey but now in this last day there is to be a prophet not a propheus though in this age there are many more women supporting are given the Revelation than men and and the infallible word says that he the prophet will reveal the Mysteries to the end time people and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he says there are there are always those who say that God's people are going to they're going to come together through a collective Revelation he goes I challenge that statement it's a BAL and valid assumption in the face of Revelations 10:7 now I do not deny that people will prophesy in the last age and their Ministries can and will be correct but I do he goes I do not deny that there will be prophets even as in the days of Paul when there was one agabus a prophet who prophesied a famine he goes I agree that that is so but I deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there is more than one major prophet messenger who will reveal the Mysteries as contained in the word and who has the ministry to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers thus sayith the Lord by his unfailing words stands and shall stand and be Vindicated there is one Prophet Messenger to the age and on the basis of human behavior alone anyone knows that where there are many people that are even divided upon even lesser points of major Doctrine than that we hold together all right we're going to we're going we're coming to a close now who then will have the power of infallibility who then will have the power of of infallibility brother Joe not at all brother Aaron he's a great man great preacher but he's not infallible brother Tim we love him great pastor but not perfect so put any man you want to put there man in himself has come short of the glory of God but notice what your Prophet said who then will have the power of infallibility which is to be rest stored in the last age for this last age is going to go back to manifesting the pure word bride and it's more than just emotion because I'm showing you tonight there's a lot more to it than just jumping and shouting it's staying with the word but this word should produce some excitement because it should show you where you are who you are and whose you are notice now that means we have the word once again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul he goes I will tell you who will have it it will be a prophet as thoroughly Vindicated or even more thoroughly Vindicated than was any prophet in all the ages from En to this day because this man will of necessity had the Capstone prophetic Ministry and God will show him forth he won't need to speak for himself God will speak for him by the voice of the the sign what am I telling you and the prophet of God said God did more in my Ministry than he did in his own Ministry what was he showing that that was the infallible gift that God placed in that generation in that age that was going to do the supernatural by turning the hearts of the children back to the original [Music] faith that God spoke through it brought it to fulfillment that's right so revelation 10 shows that the seventh Angel's message will be a person in the last days anointed of the of God for a Ministry just like Elijah the prophet as is predicted in Malachi 4 to reveal the true word of the original God in this generation the original word of God in this generation so the messenger of Malachi 4 and the messenger are the angel of Revelations 10:7 they are one and the same yes right so brother Joe I need to I need a quote good I'm glad you asked they asked brother brandom a question answer 1964 is a seventh angel as spokes or spoken of in Revelations 10 is he the same person as Elijah of Malachi 4 yes it's the same person he didn't go in a big debate about it yes he's the same person so if let me just ask you how many of your hearts have been turned how many of your hearts have been turned so we're living in the hour of fulfillment so if your heart has been turned and the messenger of Malachi 4 and the the angel of Revelations 10:7 are the one and the same then Revelation 10:7 has to be fulfilled just like Malachi 4 has been revealed because your heart has been turned and therefore there had to be a voice in the end time and he come and He restored all the L sins and he broke the seals there and he made known all the Mysteries the mystery of the baptism the mystery of serpent se he made known the mysteries of God there's nothing left church all the mysteries of God have been made known by The One messenger and he's a prophet Messenger to the Ang he's God sent God revealed God Vindicated for a generation don't you ever worry and question this message don't you don't you get a back up on sharing somebody what you believe God has Vindicated this word they may not see it but you see it they may never come unto the understanding that you have but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear we're living musicians come in the hour of fulfillment and how does God start the fulfilling he sends a voice he sends a prophet and he vindicates it over and over and over and over and over and over so you will never doubt so you'll never question so Satan can never put it in your mind well what about this he missed here he never missed because it wasn't his thoughts and it's not his message but it's God's so Malachi 4 5 and six fulfilled and I ask you if it's not William brandham if it's not William brandham then who that's right come on you doubs out there if it's not William Brandon then who if it's not now then when we're closer than we've ever been to the coming of the Lord and somebody has to have their hearts turned back so if it's not William Brown they tell me where he's at I'm going to follow that man but as long as you can't show me where he's at I'm going to stay with the Vindicated voice I'm going to stay with the message of this hour because for me my heart has been turned my life has been changed I'm walking in tun with the word of God Luke 17:30 as it was in the days of Sodom or in the days of Noah what was it in the days of Noah man they was in a solom condition I you got to be blind DEA and dumb if you ain't realize where we living today lgbtq has done got into the pulpit they done got into the educational system they got into the politics everywhere you go you bump into them every if you go to Walmart that's right solom is all around us oh but what happened in that day when the son of man when the son of man is being revealed woo a prophet on the scene Discerning thoughts and intents of the heart making known the mind of God that's right Revelations 3 20 and 21 fulfilled Jesus Christ is on the outside of his own church knocking trying to get back in but he can't because they done kicked him out because now they done put bobbed hair lesbians up behind the pulpit anybody can come they preach a message of acceptance but let me just say if it was an Abomination then it's an Abomination today God never changed fulfilled Revelations 10:7 as I said earlier Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 same so if Malachi 4 has been revealed Revelation 10 revealed let me tell you Church the seals are open all seven open if number seven is not open then William Brandon was not that messenger that's right because what he will do will reveal those divinely revealed secrets that were contained in the seals so he must that angel that messenger must reveal all Seven Seals and it's done fulfilled we're living in the hour of fulfillment Zechariah 12 verse 2 and 3 Israel back in her Homeland 1948 raised a flag in 1947 but oh brother Joe what are you talking about she's a burdensome Stone let me just share something with you as we close May 22nd 2024 B Bolivia Colombia All sever diplomatic relations with Israel Baran Chad Chile Honduras Jordan South Africa turkey have recalled their ambassadors from Israel citing the Israeli actions during the war the US President Joe Biden has warned that Israel risk losing international support over its indiscriminate bombing of civilians in the against Hamas in the besed Gaza Strip Biden also suggested that the US views Israel Israel's government as extreme extreme normally we put that word they put that word extreme on terrorists uncontrollable unmanageable and then we find some of Israel's closest European allies press for a ceasefire fire in the war with Hamas on Sunday underscoring growing International unease with the devastating impact of the conflict of God of civilians population so Israel becoming a burdensome Stone check fulfilled Nation after nation is going to turn on her and they're just now prepping and it's taking a war against her they bombed her first somebody come in your house you're

bam prophesied and what the scriptures prophesied of what would be in the end time and it's not to scare us but it's to let us see exactly where we are he said you want to see where you are in time
