[20:23] today and forever therefore we can have
[20:25] confidence in the middle of our storms
[20:29] amen we have some prayer requests today
[20:32] brother Creed I met a lady named Kelsey
[20:35] she's battling lupus and diabetes and
[20:39] also needs a second cataract surgery
[20:42] and brother Craig told her we would have
[20:44] prayer for her as a church so I remember
[20:46] that need his brother Cyril from South
[20:50] Africa

[20:54] away I want to remember the family so if
[20:57] you remember them this morning

[21:01] and also we want to continue to remember
[21:03] from brother Ron Spencer been kind of
[21:06] weak this this this week because of a
[21:08] stomach virus and he contacted so I just
[21:12] want to ask the Lord to touch him today
[21:13] and minister to him and strengthen him
[21:16] just Erica Parker as well has been in a
[21:19] real weak condition but it doesn't
[21:21] matter if we get to the last thread he's
[21:25] still God
[21:26] he has a final say and I'm not saying
[21:29] that to say that she's at the final
[21:31] thread I'm just saying no matter where
[21:33] she's at God's still in control and we
[21:36] can have confidence Amen in prayer for
[21:38] her and the needs by the Ross is here
[21:40] with us again this morning and we're
[21:43] just asking God to do something special
[21:45] for him today and it doesn't matter what

[21:49] whether they say the cancer is or it
[21:51] isn't God's still God
[21:54] doesn't matter if it's all through the
[21:55] body and it's touching every part of the
[21:57] body God's still God we know he's a god
[22:00] of impossibilities therefore we have
[22:03] confidence when we go to him in prayer
[22:05] and knowing that when we ask

[43:22] and we went on and planted didn't go
[43:25] down to Egypt but then you blessed him a
[43:28] hundredfold in the time of drought Lord
[43:30] we thank you for those provisions
[43:33] we're asking Lord that you'd anoint the
[43:35] word today as you speak to hearts and
[43:38] lives and manifest your great glory in
[43:42] our midst today and as we read your word
[43:45] together may we rejoice in the god of
[43:48] our salvation
[43:50] Lord in the god of Truth
[43:52] we thank you for it in Jesus name
[43:57] amen and amen praise the Lord God bless
[44:01] you amen I can tell you're ready to have
[44:03] church
[44:05] we've got a good start already with you
[44:07] worshiping the Lord together thank you
[44:09] and we so appreciate God speaking to us
[44:13] today already and songs of Victory amen
[44:18] and I I believe that the church is a
[44:21] Victorious Church
[44:22] and she is to be without spot a wrinkle
[44:25] as promised and um if you look with me
[44:29] to Genesis Chapter 18 we're going to
[44:31] read from the 10th verse then I want to
[44:34] pick up in the Book of Joel again
[44:37] as a borrowed title today from brother
[44:40] branham's he called it the restoration
[44:42] of the bright tree
[44:44] you may not know this but he tells this
[44:47] as he preaches said I got this thought
[44:51] this morning from when brother Neville
[44:53] was preaching
[44:55] and he said that this thought came to me
[44:58] and he said so I'm preaching on it this
[45:01] evening amen he gave us about a
[45:03] three-hour sermon on the restoration of
[45:06] the Bride tree
[45:07] so he you know he received a thought
[45:10] from the Lord that was delivered by
[45:12] Brother
[45:13] um brother Neville as he preached under
[45:15] inspiration and and of course we're
[45:18] still operating under that same
[45:21] inspiration
[45:23] just as Elisha followed the ministry of
[45:26] Elijah so we continue as as Believers to
[45:30] to walk into that double portion of the
[45:34] promise of God
[45:36] um I'm going to be speaking in a in a
[45:38] service or two on
[45:40] um God willing on the Sarah and the
[45:43] latter Reigns I've got some things there
[45:45] that I want to bring uh to you as far as
[45:49] what God is doing in this hour in this
[45:52] time but I wanted to finish up some
[45:54] thoughts this morning that I've had them
[45:57] and uh before we go into that so uh
[46:00] we're just going to look back at the
[46:02] Book of Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 10
[46:05] and he said I was certainly returning to
[46:09] thee according to the time of life
[46:12] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[46:14] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[46:16] which was behind him then Joel chapter 2
[46:19] verse 23 we will read from there
[46:24] Joel chapter 2 verse 23 be glad then
[46:27] you children of Zion and rejoice in the
[46:30] Lord your God see we had a right to
[46:32] rejoice and be glad today amen for he
[46:35] had given you the former Reign
[46:36] moderately and he will cause to come
[46:38] down for you to the Rain the former rain
[46:39] and the latter rain in the first month
[46:42] and the floors shall be full of Wheat
[46:44] and the fat shall overflow with wine and
[46:46] oil and I will restore to you the years
[46:50] that the Locust has eaten the canker
[46:53] worm the caterpillar the Palm worm my
[46:55] great Army which I sent among you and ye
[46:58] shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and
[47:00] praise the name of the Lord your God
[47:02] that it dealt wondrously with you and my
[47:04] people shall never be ashamed and you
[47:08] shall know that I am in the midst of
[47:11] Israel and that I am the Lord your God
[47:15] and none else and my people shall never
[47:18] be ashamed see we're going to know it
[47:20] because he's the god that restores
[47:23] so when he restores you know he said I'm
[47:26] going to give abundance you're going to
[47:28] overflow I believe we're in the hour not
[47:32] just to be blessed now but in the hour
[47:34] of the Overflow
[47:36] amen where God is pouring out of spirit
[47:39] and manifesting himself in a great way
[47:42] and it shall come to pass afterwards
[47:46] that I will pour out my spirit upon All
[47:48] Flesh and your sons and your daughters
[47:51] shall prophesy your old men shall dream
[47:54] dreams your young men shall see visions
[47:56] and upon the servants and upon the
[47:59] handmaids in those days will I pour out
[48:02] my spirit
[48:04] now I want to turn to Isaiah chapter 61
[48:07] and I'm just using these scriptures as
[48:10] the basis for where we're going today in
[48:14] this moment of restoration and if I were
[48:17] you you know wherever I was if you're in
[48:20] a if you're in a physical need or a
[48:23] spiritual need or whatever else I I
[48:26] would begin right now to realize that
[48:29] the god that we serve is a God who
[48:31] restores
[48:33] amen he's restores he'll restore Health
[48:36] to your body he'll restore Health to
[48:39] your marriages to your homes to your
[48:42] family to the church to your finances
[48:46] whatever it is so even though sometimes
[48:49] we may speak on things that are being
[48:52] restored I want you to realize it also
[48:55] has a practical
[48:57] application as well to you in your life
[49:00] and as you hear of God restoring then
[49:03] you look at to say to God lord is you're
[49:06] pouring out the Overflow as you're
[49:09] pouring out the blessings as you are
[49:11] giving the increase I want to be a part
[49:14] of that increase I've got a need in my
[49:17] life and you said I will restore it I've
[49:20] been robbed I've been you know
[49:22] something's been taken from me but now I
[49:25] am going to claim that which is mine
[49:28] and so the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[49:32] because the Lord hath anointed me to
[49:36] preach the Good Tidings to the meek he
[49:39] has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted
[49:42] to proclaim the Liberty to the captives
[49:44] and the opening of the prison to them
[49:47] that are bound look at this restoration
[49:49] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[49:53] Lord let me just stop for a moment this
[49:56] acceptable year is not an actual year
[49:59] like 365 days but it is a a time of of
[50:05] Jubilee it's actually acceptable year is
[50:08] a time of Jubilee of God's restoration
[50:11] to his people so the first part of this
[50:14] will refer to his first coming where
[50:17] Jesus Took the book and he opened this
[50:20] scripture and of course it's still
[50:23] um unfolds into this day where that
[50:25] anointing is here to bind up to heal to
[50:29] deliver it's an anointing upon the
[50:32] church as he finishes up the great work
[50:35] of God but in its second part it adds
[50:38] the day of Vengeance of our God
[50:42] and all that mourn will be comforted for
[50:45] even the dead of Seven Ages will rise so
[50:49] you know the last things that Paul said
[50:51] concerning the coming he said now take
[50:54] these words and comfort those Comfort
[50:56] one another with these words amen so
[51:00] again this is a a proclamation the day
[51:04] of Vengeance the acceptable Lord a day
[51:07] of the Lord and the day of Vengeance to
[51:10] comfort all that mourn to point to them
[51:13] that mourn in Zion to give them Beauty
[51:16] for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning
[51:21] look at this restoration the Garment of
[51:24] Praise for the spirit of heaviness
[51:26] that they might be called the Trees of
[51:29] Righteousness the planting of the Lord
[51:32] that he might be glorified and they
[51:35] shall build it the old waste and shall
[51:38] raise up the form of desolations and
[51:40] they shall repair the way cities the
[51:42] desolations of many generations God
[51:46] bless you can be seated
[51:48] thank you Lord for this wonderful Word
[51:51] of Life
[51:52] amen I tell you every word you'll just
[51:55] hang your soul on it this morning
[51:58] Amen to realize this is our god
[52:01] prophesying of what he will do in this
[52:03] last day as he finishes up Redemption if
[52:08] this was true in the first part of
[52:09] redemption it's here it's just even more
[52:12] true here as he finishes up Redemption
[52:15] now so again I'm looking here as he said
[52:20] they will build up the old waste and
[52:22] they shall raise up former desolations
[52:24] they shall repair the way cities the
[52:27] desolations of many generations you see
[52:30] the restoration of neglected forgotten
[52:34] truths the desolations of many
[52:37] generations now in our Genesis reading
[52:40] there was a prophecy lying in the
[52:42] historical account of this AIDS barren
[52:46] woman receiving a promise and becoming
[52:50] fruitful by restoration remember if you
[52:53] remember it's um it's a it's a God that
[52:56] that says there's nothing too hard for
[52:59] me this had reached the point of
[53:02] hopelessness in her barrenness and she's
[53:06] now 90 years old it's past Baron way
[53:09] past and yet um she has been set aside
[53:13] and Abandoned and desolate she will not
[53:17] be a part of Abraham's tree it looks
[53:19] like instead
[53:21] um Hagar a bonds woman an Egyptian slave
[53:25] girl a type of denomination is thought
[53:28] to be the bride tree the fruitful branch
[53:31] of the abrahamic race but here the
[53:35] Angel's visit is to assure Sarah that I
[53:40] will restore saith the Lord
[53:43] and the message of restoration in which
[53:46] Sarah is one of the types is the theme
[53:49] of this last day
[53:52] um he will restore a church to
[53:53] everything that was lost in Joel's
[53:57] prophecy he Likens her to a tree or some
[54:01] planting of the Lord that has been
[54:03] Stripped by four different insects or
[54:07] shall I say four stages of the same bug
[54:10] but now God had planted a church on the
[54:14] day of Pentecost and he had a church
[54:16] like he wanted it the restoration of the
[54:20] Bright Tree brother Branham told us now
[54:22] let's picture it they said I want you to
[54:24] get first a picture of God's big tree
[54:28] what he had in the beginning because
[54:31] we're going to be restored we need a
[54:33] picture of what was lost and what the
[54:37] tree used to look like before it got
[54:40] eaten down so let's picture a big tree
[54:43] of God's big God's tree is bearing nine
[54:48] spiritual gifts notice it is a fruitful
[54:51] tree bearing nine spiritual gifts
[54:55] they're Healing The Sick they are
[54:58] speaking in tongues they are casting out
[55:01] Devils they are doing great works they
[55:04] are preaching the unadulterated word of
[55:06] God no denomination to tie them down
[55:09] they're free doing the great work this
[55:11] is a church that brother by Adam looked
[55:14] back and he said let's picture it let's
[55:16] see what it wants to look like so we can
[55:20] know what the end time bribetry is going
[55:24] to look like it'll bear nine spiritual
[55:26] gifts The Healing The Sick they're
[55:29] speaking in tongues they're casting out
[55:31] Devils they're doing great work sir
[55:33] preaching the unadulterated word no
[55:35] denominations to tie them down they're
[55:38] free they're doing a great work now this
[55:41] is the picture of God's bride tree
[55:44] it's a fruitful Branch Jesus said the
[55:49] branches within the vine within his Vine
[55:52] they must be a fruitful branch bringing
[55:56] forth much fruit and the branches that
[55:59] don't bear fruit he says are not in me
[56:02] if you if you see a branch and it's not
[56:05] bringing forth fruit then it's not in me
[56:08] and so he said well my life isn't
[56:12] flowing through them or otherwise it
[56:15] would be a fruit-bearing branch you see
[56:18] then they are withered and and uh and
[56:21] will be gathered to be burned in the
[56:24] fire now again brother Bradham told us
[56:27] that if God brought forth his first
[56:31] Branch out of that vine if it was a
[56:34] Pentecostal Branch with power Visions
[56:38] Revelations healings sanctification Holy
[56:42] Spirit the next Branch will be the same
[56:45] amen certainly will every time that vine
[56:48] puts forth a branch it'll be exactly
[56:51] like the one that was at the first place
[56:53] so God planted a church on the day of
[56:56] Pentecost but there came devours from
[57:00] Satan to eat it down and it is shown in
[57:03] the first churches is a white horse
[57:06] rider an antichrist Spirit to close up
[57:10] and to seal up the promises of the book
[57:13] from the people and it rides to the end
[57:17] morphing from one stage to another
[57:21] conquering and devouring the church
[57:24] remember this the Bride is a
[57:27] supernatural people
[57:29] and to be the bride it requires a
[57:32] supernatural birth
[57:34] otherwise it is not in the vine and the
[57:37] flow of life of the vine is not in it
[57:40] again brother Brandon said I'm just an
[57:43] old-fashioned backwards preacher that
[57:46] believes in old-time heartfelt sky blue
[57:49] sin killing religion that's right that
[57:53] believes that the old-fashioned way I
[57:55] believe a man that when he's born again
[57:57] he becomes the Son of God the
[58:00] supernatural power of God dwells in him
[58:03] we have a supernatural God we have a
[58:05] supernatural life I believe that any man
[58:08] that's born of the supernatural Spirit
[58:10] believes in the Supernatural we got a
[58:14] supernatural Resurrection we have a
[58:16] supernatural heaven we are the
[58:18] supernatural Rapture I believe the whole
[58:21] thing is built around Supernatural and
[58:24] if a man is born in the spirit of God he
[58:26] believes in the Supernatural he can't
[58:29] help it because he's a Son of God and
[58:33] that's the reason we we got so many old
[58:35] cold at formal in different God forsaken
[58:38] backslidden churches because men and
[58:41] women are not born of the spirit of God
[58:44] they have no taste of God they know know
[58:47] nothing about God all they know about is
[58:51] Theology and that's the reason you can't
[58:53] get them to believe a thing that's
[58:55] exactly right you've got to get the man
[58:57] right in his heart first before he can
[59:00] believe he's got nothing to believe on
[59:02] he ain't got nothing to believe with so
[59:05] you see again we we must real realize
[59:08] then it starts then with a Life coming
[59:12] out of the vine itself
[59:15] you see even the church today is
[59:18] supposed to be like the original church
[59:21] at Pentecost with the power of God March
[59:25] 16 in action and that is it church that
[59:28] Jesus claims as his own
[59:31] now of course we know what the original
[59:33] route was look at John 15 and 5. he says
[59:37] he speaks of the original root he said I
[59:41] am divine
[59:42] and you are the branches
[59:45] he that abideth in me and I in him the
[59:48] same bringeth forth more much fruit for
[59:51] without me you can do nothing
[59:54] it's important you know to be born of
[59:58] the Vine because without him you can be
[1:00:01] nothing
[1:00:03] amen so now of course in the Book of
[1:00:06] Romans Paul would use the
[1:00:09] um the the parable or the analogy or the
[1:00:11] type of um the olive tree to represent
[1:00:14] Israel and because of unbelief branches
[1:00:18] were broken off
[1:00:20] and God allowed the Gentiles as a wild
[1:00:23] Olive Branch than to be grafted in
[1:00:27] and so in the same manner Christ was the
[1:00:30] root of the gospel and Christ the vine
[1:00:33] put out his first branch and that was on
[1:00:36] the day of Pentecost and the Holy Ghost
[1:00:39] wrote a book of Acts through that branch
[1:00:43] and now I want you to understand this
[1:00:45] was not the Acts of the Apostles
[1:00:49] nor was it the acts of men but it was
[1:00:53] the acts of the holy spirit in the
[1:00:57] apostles
[1:00:58] so when we are speaking of another book
[1:01:00] of Acts we are not talking about the
[1:01:03] acts of men
[1:01:04] amen we are not talking about the flaws
[1:01:07] and their failures we are talking about
[1:01:10] the Holy Spirit and his eyes
[1:01:13] amen we're not going to repeat the book
[1:01:16] of Acts with all its bitterness and his
[1:01:19] quarrels and his fussing and his
[1:01:21] unbelievers in his and his divisions and
[1:01:24] and all of these other things with its
[1:01:27] ananiasis it's a virus like that in that
[1:01:30] sense we are going to repeat the book of
[1:01:32] Acts because it'll be the holy spirit in
[1:01:35] a church operating in that church moving
[1:01:39] in that church flowing in that church
[1:01:42] becoming the branches of that thine
[1:01:46] buried his life buried his fruits
[1:01:54] remember
[1:01:55] I want you to remember
[1:01:58] God is promised
[1:02:01] Christ has put him forth another branch
[1:02:04] in this last day a restored tree
[1:02:10] that's why I've said I mean why not you
[1:02:12] get ready to be restored also
[1:02:16] amen even as an individual come on
[1:02:19] even as just a member of the body why
[1:02:22] don't you get expect to have Restoration
[1:02:24] in your own life in your own family for
[1:02:27] your own needs
[1:02:29] this is a Day of His blessings this is a
[1:02:33] day of the Overflow this is a day where
[1:02:37] full Joy is here
[1:02:39] but Victory is here full power is here
[1:02:43] the fullness of the Holy Ghost says son
[1:02:46] of man revealing himself the same Christ
[1:02:49] of yesterday being the Christ of today
[1:02:54] now as Abraham was the root of the Jews
[1:02:58] and the branches was broken off because
[1:03:00] of unbelief and for rejecting the
[1:03:03] Messiah
[1:03:04] and the Gentile sin is a wild Olive
[1:03:07] Branch was grafted in
[1:03:09] even so the original Branch was cut off
[1:03:13] from Christ
[1:03:14] and the early church died in its first
[1:03:18] love its fervency his power and grabs in
[1:03:22] his place
[1:03:23] was the first church of Rome
[1:03:27] amen the Catholic Church
[1:03:30] who lived off the words of Christ and I
[1:03:33] want you to know that lived off the
[1:03:35] words of Christ
[1:03:36] they didn't even write a new Bible
[1:03:39] they took the words of the Bible
[1:03:43] and they were living off of that and
[1:03:45] using that for their own purpose
[1:03:47] notice this took off took on the name of
[1:03:52] being the Church of Jesus Christ but the
[1:03:55] fruit it bore
[1:03:56] was nothing like the first branches of
[1:03:59] Pentecost nothing like it in the in time
[1:04:02] other in fact you know his brother Aaron
[1:04:05] did so well on his his teaching on the
[1:04:08] church ages you know it what what it
[1:04:11] looked like it looked more like Pagan
[1:04:13] Rome
[1:04:14] than it did the day of Pentecost
[1:04:16] right it's beginning to have its Hail
[1:04:19] Marys and and the mother of God and you
[1:04:22] know all these goddesses and gods in the
[1:04:24] Trinity of gods and Saints to worship
[1:04:27] and all of these other things it began
[1:04:29] to look more like like paganism and
[1:04:32] satanic move that it began to look like
[1:04:35] the book of Acts yeah
[1:04:39] and you see again the the Catholic
[1:04:42] church was living off the words of
[1:04:45] Christ took on the name of being the
[1:04:48] Church of Jesus Christ but the fruit it
[1:04:51] bore
[1:04:52] look nothing like the first branch
[1:04:56] at Pentecost
[1:04:58] so you get down there with something
[1:05:00] crafted in
[1:05:02] because it's not matching the original
[1:05:05] root and of the original branch
[1:05:08] you know in time that would be branches
[1:05:12] of Baptists or Lutheran or methodists of
[1:05:15] zuza street now 40 000 other
[1:05:18] denominations have been grafted in
[1:05:22] so now the tree looks just like
[1:05:25] brother Branham shared the thought of
[1:05:27] what he saw at John Jarrett's place
[1:05:31] where you know a fruit tree
[1:05:33] you know with varieties of fruit
[1:05:36] you know he was he was there on his farm
[1:05:39] and he sees this fruit tree with that's
[1:05:41] an orange tree and it has oranges and
[1:05:44] grapefruits and lemons and tangerines
[1:05:46] and all other kinds it was an orange
[1:05:50] tree with all other kinds of branches of
[1:05:53] of citrus varieties that have been
[1:05:55] crafted in these these branches were
[1:05:58] living off the life of the original
[1:06:01] orange tree
[1:06:03] and he said to brother Sharon I I
[1:06:05] suppose next year these branches will
[1:06:08] produce oranges they won't produce
[1:06:09] lemons and grapefruits and whatever he
[1:06:12] said no he said that's not true he said
[1:06:14] they next year they will produce again
[1:06:17] tangerines and grapefruits and whatever
[1:06:19] because they're living off the life of
[1:06:22] the orange tree
[1:06:24] but there is no change to their nature
[1:06:29] amen so therefore they're producing
[1:06:32] other kinds of fruits
[1:06:34] amen that what the original tree was and
[1:06:39] he said well when will the tree produce
[1:06:41] oranges again and he said when it puts
[1:06:44] out another branch
[1:06:47] and when he puts out another Branch the
[1:06:50] root there will then bear an orange tree
[1:06:53] branch and it will produce oranges
[1:06:57] like the original root
[1:07:00] now so how did all this get in how come
[1:07:04] we got all these different varieties of
[1:07:06] Christianity
[1:07:08] how come we got all these different
[1:07:11] kinds of fruits that you look upon them
[1:07:14] and some are Swede and some are sour and
[1:07:17] summer you know this and some of that
[1:07:20] and you know but they're they're nothing
[1:07:21] like what was on the day of Pentecost
[1:07:24] you see you see the way that happens is
[1:07:28] you just split the tree
[1:07:31] notice almost every one of these
[1:07:33] movements came out of a split
[1:07:38] amen here the Antichrist comes in with
[1:07:42] his with his bloody sword and he splits
[1:07:45] the tree
[1:07:46] and there are plants in it another
[1:07:49] branch
[1:07:52] and now we got in in Christianity
[1:07:56] instead of orange tree fruit now we have
[1:08:00] another
[1:08:02] lemon
[1:08:04] Grapefruit Tangerine different varieties
[1:08:07] I have your way Christianity whatever
[1:08:11] flavor you want
[1:08:13] it's all citrus it's all Christian
[1:08:18] now so you see that's exactly what
[1:08:21] happens when churches are grafted into
[1:08:23] Christ such as or try to supposed to be
[1:08:27] uh you know slid in there by name
[1:08:30] calling themselves the Churches of
[1:08:32] Christ and what do they bring
[1:08:34] denominational fruits
[1:08:38] so you look at their fruit of course a
[1:08:40] Baptist Branch brings forth Baptist
[1:08:42] fruits a presbyterian Branch produces
[1:08:45] Presbyterian fruits you know how did
[1:08:47] this happen when men split the tree and
[1:08:50] grafted in
[1:08:52] a denominational branch
[1:08:55] now if but however I'm just going to
[1:08:59] share you some Snippets and things from
[1:09:01] Brother Branham over and over and over
[1:09:03] again because I want to belabor the
[1:09:06] point
[1:09:08] I want to I want you to I want you to
[1:09:10] see it from every different direction
[1:09:12] and from Time After Time where brother
[1:09:14] Branham is is declaring you know because
[1:09:17] you can build you can build a Doctrine
[1:09:19] on just one quote
[1:09:22] amen you just just think of all the
[1:09:24] quote you took is Matthew 28 19. that's
[1:09:28] that's what that's all the quote they
[1:09:29] take they don't take all the other
[1:09:31] quotes of Acts chapter 2 38.
[1:09:35] of Acts 19 of Acts 10 and all them to
[1:09:39] the Bible where they baptized in the
[1:09:41] name of Jesus Christ so they isolate one
[1:09:43] quote and build a whole church on it
[1:09:47] now so again we but we we want to do we
[1:09:51] want to be able to look at it now time
[1:09:53] on time and time as brother Branham and
[1:09:56] why brother Branham because he's the
[1:09:58] seventh angel
[1:10:00] to whom the message comes to from Jesus
[1:10:03] Christ
[1:10:05] amen Seven Stars in the hand of
[1:10:07] Jehovah's seven churches representing
[1:10:09] seven ages seven seven Messengers to
[1:10:12] Seven Ages
[1:10:14] that's why we are referring to him if
[1:10:17] that Branch ever brings forth another
[1:10:19] limb it'll be like the first one was but
[1:10:23] let me tell you brother if the holy
[1:10:24] ghost is real in the church today the
[1:10:27] kind of church it had that wrote the
[1:10:29] book of Acts behind it if the Church of
[1:10:32] the Living God the Church of Jesus
[1:10:33] Christ become again Alive by the same
[1:10:37] holy spirit that fell on the day of
[1:10:38] Pentecost it'll write a book of Acts
[1:10:41] behind it right it'll be persistent at
[1:10:44] perseverance until the things come along
[1:10:47] and that's why we want to be persistent
[1:10:49] and persevering we're not giving up
[1:10:53] [Applause]
[1:10:54] until the tree looks like the original
[1:10:58] one
[1:10:59] till it Bears all the same fruits the
[1:11:03] same nine spiritual gifts the same Holy
[1:11:06] Ghost the same power of God come on
[1:11:09] Church we're going to be a person Church
[1:11:12] we're pursuing after it
[1:11:16] now you look at the tree
[1:11:19] and all around it
[1:11:21] is broken off
[1:11:23] and withered dead or dying branches
[1:11:28] to be gathered for the burning trial of
[1:11:31] tribulation
[1:11:36] I ran into
[1:11:37] a woman that used to be the teller at
[1:11:41] the bank that we used in Homer
[1:11:43] she's 80 something years old
[1:11:45] and she I met her in the grocery store
[1:11:49] and she knows I'm a pastor and she's a
[1:11:51] brother to him we're meeting together
[1:11:53] from different denominations and we met
[1:11:56] in a certain place the other day about
[1:11:58] 40 of us and we're praying and we're
[1:12:01] trying to get you know everybody in
[1:12:03] cooperative and because our churches are
[1:12:06] dying
[1:12:07] said our members are going away and
[1:12:09] we're trying to do something there to to
[1:12:12] revitalize our church
[1:12:15] you see you see you look at it all
[1:12:19] around the tree it's broken off and
[1:12:22] withered dying branches
[1:12:27] amen because God's been doing some
[1:12:29] pruning in this day
[1:12:31] he's declaring a man that I of who is
[1:12:34] his so he comes through and he said this
[1:12:37] is not a fruitful branch
[1:12:39] oh yeah it's got lemons on it but that's
[1:12:42] not what I planted
[1:12:43] well he's got tangerines on it but
[1:12:46] that's not what I planted that's not
[1:12:48] what the original church is and God
[1:12:51] prunes off everything that's why he says
[1:12:54] come out of her my people
[1:12:57] [Applause]
[1:12:59] because this is the day a pruning
[1:13:03] because in order for the fruit the tree
[1:13:06] to be a fruitful Branch all of these
[1:13:09] things that are sapping the energy has
[1:13:11] to be cut off
[1:13:15] so they're just sap suckers
[1:13:19] now
[1:13:20] why is God doing this because he said I
[1:13:23] will restore saith the Lord
[1:13:26] and because of unbelief because of wrong
[1:13:28] fruit and the rejection of the word God
[1:13:31] has broke them off
[1:13:33] and he's now bringing for the branch out
[1:13:35] of the root
[1:13:37] and this branches exactly like the
[1:13:40] original branch that came on the day of
[1:13:43] Pentecost it is bearing the same ox and
[1:13:45] the fruit of the root and any branch
[1:13:48] that is not bearing the fruit a
[1:13:51] Pentecost is being pruned from the Vine
[1:13:56] I want you to even think that about your
[1:13:58] own personal life
[1:14:00] because it doesn't have the fruit of
[1:14:02] Pentecost
[1:14:05] you're going to be pruned off
[1:14:08] and let me tell you a little something
[1:14:10] else
[1:14:11] if you have been fruitful
[1:14:14] does not satisfied with that he's going
[1:14:18] to purge you
[1:14:19] so you bring forth more fruit
[1:14:25] amen come on now Church this is what you
[1:14:28] do
[1:14:31] you do separating you from sin from
[1:14:33] parasites of the world right amen he has
[1:14:36] prayed you with a spray brother Madam
[1:14:39] called it a DDT and he said he prayed he
[1:14:43] sprayed it there to keep the bugs off of
[1:14:45] you he said it's a repellent a
[1:14:47] predestination
[1:14:48] [Music]
[1:14:49] Hallelujah because God is deterring I'll
[1:14:53] have a church and seal me without butter
[1:14:55] wrinkle
[1:14:59] now
[1:15:02] so you see
[1:15:03] Jesus said in Saint John 15 the Branson
[1:15:07] did not bear fruit would be cut off
[1:15:10] and it would wither
[1:15:13] and that's where our denominations today
[1:15:15] are being pruned off but not just a
[1:15:17] denomination any person
[1:15:21] will be cut off and wither
[1:15:25] only the fruit Baron the kind that bears
[1:15:28] the fruit that works of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:30] will be able to continue in the Vine
[1:15:35] brother Branham tells about this
[1:15:38] let me just share a couple of these
[1:15:40] right here he said you Farmers your
[1:15:42] Texans Louisiana and so now we're
[1:15:44] talking to you
[1:15:46] and many and what you've been here what
[1:15:48] you may be here anyone that's got common
[1:15:50] sense
[1:15:53] so maybe I got you that time
[1:15:55] ever seen a Vine grow knew that the that
[1:15:58] the Mind does not bear the fruit
[1:16:00] but it but the branches of the vine is
[1:16:03] what bears the fruit and it gets the
[1:16:06] light from the vine Jesus is our
[1:16:08] resource of life
[1:16:10] yeah you see he he had to differentiate
[1:16:14] but between what bears the fruit because
[1:16:17] if you're just looking for Jesus to do
[1:16:19] it
[1:16:20] when he comes back oh we'll have
[1:16:22] Miracles when he comes back oh we'll
[1:16:25] have Divine Healing or when he comes
[1:16:27] back you know in heaven you don't need
[1:16:29] Divine Healing and miracles in heaven
[1:16:32] we need them right here
[1:16:35] amen and so therefore there has to be
[1:16:38] branches that is bearing the fruit
[1:16:44] now he said the life that's in that vine
[1:16:47] is in the branch and if that vine puts
[1:16:50] forth the first branch of a great bunch
[1:16:52] of grapes comes forth from it if it ever
[1:16:55] puts forth another Branch it'll be a
[1:16:56] bunch of grapes
[1:16:58] it'll put a forth another Branch it'll
[1:17:00] be a a bunch of grapes it'll be the same
[1:17:03] kind of branch on the end of the vine oh
[1:17:05] God every time that vine puts forth the
[1:17:08] branch it'll be like the first Branch
[1:17:10] why because the life that's in the vine
[1:17:13] will put forth the same kind of Branch
[1:17:15] if the first Branch both with grapes the
[1:17:18] next one bring forth pumpkins the next
[1:17:20] one bring more citrus fruit then that
[1:17:23] then on a while it won't it won't do it
[1:17:25] but if the True Vine puts forth a branch
[1:17:27] and if Jesus is the vine and the branch
[1:17:31] that brought forth the real Pentecostal
[1:17:33] church and it wrote a book of Acts with
[1:17:36] signs and wonders following the believer
[1:17:38] if that Trill True Vine brings forth
[1:17:43] another Branch they'll write a book of
[1:17:45] Acts behind it
[1:17:47] amen
[1:17:50] praise the Lord
[1:17:52] that's why he says give that vine I'm
[1:17:56] going to share some of the Snippets
[1:17:58] if that vine ever puts forth another
[1:18:00] branch
[1:18:01] it'll be a Pentecostal branch
[1:18:06] that'll write a book of Acts behind it
[1:18:10] he goes on to say
[1:18:12] and I want to keep you in mind now we're
[1:18:14] not talking about repeating Azusa Street
[1:18:19] hey man that's not the Pentecostal
[1:18:21] Branch we're talking about
[1:18:23] that was another graft
[1:18:27] that came from a split
[1:18:29] are you with me amen let me tell you we
[1:18:33] are not born of a split
[1:18:35] we are born of the word
[1:18:39] get the difference now Church we're
[1:18:41] people that have been born of a
[1:18:44] supernatural birth
[1:18:46] burn out of the vine itself
[1:18:49] amen not another denomination
[1:18:52] now there there are those that are
[1:18:55] bearing those kind of fruits but that's
[1:18:57] not who the bride is the the first
[1:19:00] branch that came forth was the
[1:19:01] Pentecostal Branch filled with
[1:19:03] Pentecostal power so impact by the Holy
[1:19:06] Spirit till they staggered under the
[1:19:08] impact of the power of God they went
[1:19:10] forth and saw Visions perform Miracles
[1:19:13] opened the eyes of the blind heal the
[1:19:15] sick Joy was in the camp they prayed in
[1:19:19] one Accord and altered them together
[1:19:21] until the building shook where they were
[1:19:23] assembled
[1:19:25] and and then he said when the church
[1:19:27] buried itself in Jesus It produced the
[1:19:30] Pentecostal church and if that first
[1:19:32] Branch come out of the Vine Pentecostal
[1:19:34] every Branch will have to be like the
[1:19:37] person we've got to get back to the
[1:19:39] Pentecostal experience
[1:19:41] again he says where the first Vine come
[1:19:44] forth the first mind out that came forth
[1:19:46] out of the vine was the Pentecostal
[1:19:48] Branch Visions Powers healing baptism of
[1:19:51] the Holy Ghost great signs and wonders
[1:19:53] the next Branch will have to be the same
[1:19:56] kind of branch
[1:19:59] Hallelujah

[1:22:55] [Applause]
[1:23:01] here's a Vine and we're the branches
[1:23:03] this church should be another
[1:23:04] Pentecostal Church filled with the Holy
[1:23:07] Ghost dominated by the spirit of God
[1:23:10] brother Branham in his prayer Lord at
[1:23:12] the first church first branch that came
[1:23:14] forth out of that vine was a Pentecostal
[1:23:17] Branch filled with the Holy Ghost signs
[1:23:19] and wonders and fruits of the spirit
[1:23:21] hanging on that vine in the branch the
[1:23:24] second Branch comes forth it'll have to
[1:23:26] be a Pentecostal Branch if it comes out
[1:23:29] of that same Vine oh Lord May men and
[1:23:32] women realize that and come back to a
[1:23:34] true Pentecostal experience of being
[1:23:37] born of the Holy Ghost and believing in
[1:23:39] the Supernatural workings that God has
[1:23:42] promised that his Spirit would do in our
[1:23:44] midst
[1:23:46] Hallelujah
[1:23:49] again if God brought forth his first
[1:23:52] branch
[1:23:53] out of that vine was a Pentecostal
[1:23:55] Branch with power Visions Revelation
[1:23:58] healing sanctification Holy Spirit the
[1:24:00] next Branch will be the same see how he
[1:24:02] says this over and over and over here's
[1:24:05] his expectation
[1:24:06] can I say it to you here's what's
[1:24:08] prophesied over you
[1:24:13] Hallelujah
[1:24:15] amen this is what's prophesied over you
[1:24:18] what I read to you in the Bible of Sarah
[1:24:21] and John come on Church amount of what
[1:24:25] Jesus said and and what Isaiah said all
[1:24:28] these scriptures what I was reading to
[1:24:30] you it's been prophesied over you
[1:24:38] yeah
[1:24:40] when the vine itself puts forth the
[1:24:42] branch it'll be a Pentecostal Branch
[1:24:44] full of the Holy Ghost doing the same
[1:24:46] signs and wonders that they did in the
[1:24:48] beginning well my church don't believe
[1:24:50] in that it wasn't so at the beginning my
[1:24:52] church don't believe in shouting it
[1:24:54] wasn't so at the beginning my church
[1:24:56] don't believe in speaking in tongues it
[1:24:58] wasn't so at the beginning
[1:25:03] then at the beginning was the
[1:25:05] Pentecostal Church
[1:25:06] and he's the vine we are the branches
[1:25:09] every time that vine brings forth the
[1:25:12] church it'll be a Pentecostal Church
[1:25:16] Pentecostal Branch same thing
[1:25:20] it was at the beginning
[1:25:24] we got a bunch of churches who call
[1:25:26] themselves Christian churches but they
[1:25:27] bear the marks of theology and
[1:25:30] organization that's different
[1:25:32] but at the Pentecostal Vine that made a
[1:25:34] Pentecostal church ever puts forth
[1:25:36] another Pentecostal Branch it'll be like
[1:25:39] it wasn't to begin and that's exactly
[1:25:40] right if Jesus Christ appears in the
[1:25:43] church he'll be the same as he was back
[1:25:45] there it won't bear lemons or
[1:25:46] grapefruits it'll bear oranges if it's
[1:25:48] an orange tree and it'll put forth its
[1:25:51] branches it's not to be an organization
[1:25:53] it'll not be denomination it'll be
[1:25:55] Christ
[1:25:56] that vine that brings forth another
[1:25:59] Branch it will be a Pentecostal Branch
[1:26:03] with science following the Believers
[1:26:05] right back to the original
[1:26:10] brother Branham labors these points all
[1:26:13] the way to the seals and even in the
[1:26:16] even in the third seal he says Joel said
[1:26:19] I will restore all the years everything
[1:26:21] will Rome made up everything the
[1:26:22] methodists eat of everything the
[1:26:24] Baptists ate up and uh and and that
[1:26:27] original Branch I'll restore it in the
[1:26:29] last days
[1:26:30] he comes right along and he said you
[1:26:32] know we we all have the commonality of
[1:26:35] being Christian like a citrus but he
[1:26:38] says you got a fruit
[1:26:40] but what do you do with it you have a
[1:26:42] form of godliness and deny the power
[1:26:45] thereof you deny signs you did not
[1:26:48] wonders you deny the Holy Ghost you did
[1:26:49] not speak it in tongues you did not
[1:26:51] Visions you deny prophecies you deny
[1:26:53] heal it you call yourself a name no
[1:26:55] wonder the Holy Ghost said a power of a
[1:26:58] group of people full of Blasphemous
[1:27:00] names sure calling themselves Christians
[1:27:03] with form of godliness but denying the
[1:27:06] power thereof
[1:27:08] so now what form is he here
[1:27:12] if we would look for Jesus today
[1:27:15] would you look for a man with nail scars
[1:27:18] would you look for a long robe and long
[1:27:20] hair and come walking in this building
[1:27:22] and you know when nail scarves on his
[1:27:24] hands and feet and say I'm Jesus that's
[1:27:27] not how he's here
[1:27:29] he is here in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:32] let me get it clear to you while we're
[1:27:34] there you will never see Jesus
[1:27:37] this side of the Rapture like that
[1:27:42] now I'm not saying you can't have a
[1:27:44] vision I'm talking about the physical of
[1:27:46] Jesus Christ
[1:27:47] you will never see Jesus like that until
[1:27:50] the meeting in the era until then he is
[1:27:54] here in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:56] his spirit is not a second person of the
[1:27:59] Trinity or the 30 it is the person
[1:28:02] the spirit that was in the body of Jesus
[1:28:05] returned to the church on the day of
[1:28:07] Pentecost and there he he divided
[1:28:10] himself and gave each one of you a
[1:28:12] portion
[1:28:14] so in this building there's not one
[1:28:16] Jesus there's hundreds of jesuses
[1:28:19] sitting right here where God's
[1:28:21] possessing his people
[1:28:24] so how will we know him
[1:28:26] how will we know him
[1:28:28] this is a 64 quote
[1:28:31] he says
[1:28:33] he said the vine energizes the branch
[1:28:36] and if the branch ever brings forth to
[1:28:38] the vine breaks forth a branch
[1:28:41] and has grapes on it the next Vine comes
[1:28:43] out or a branch out of that vine will
[1:28:45] have grapes on it if the first church
[1:28:47] that came out of that vine was a
[1:28:49] Pentecostal church with all the gifts
[1:28:53] so oh at the seals it changed no at the
[1:28:57] seals it's opened
[1:29:00] amen all the book is made available
[1:29:04] stop there just for a moment
[1:29:06] sometimes people look at there and say
[1:29:08] well brother Tim you know you're trying
[1:29:10] to emphasize tongues or you're trying to
[1:29:13] emphasize gifts or you're trying to
[1:29:15] emphasize shouting or you're listen I
[1:29:18] I'm just saying that's in the book
[1:29:21] [Applause]
[1:29:23] hallelujah it's just it's just as much
[1:29:26] in the book
[1:29:28] it's all the Mysteries
[1:29:31] hallelujah what about the mystery of
[1:29:34] speaking in tongues you ought to
[1:29:36] experience it what about the mystery of
[1:29:38] healing you ought to have it
[1:29:40] what about the mystery come on church
[1:29:43] I'm working on Miracles it ought to be
[1:29:45] in the church
[1:29:46] [Applause]
[1:29:48] God has opened the buck and it's a full
[1:29:52] gospel
[1:29:52] [Applause]
[1:29:55] not a partial all of it's there
[1:30:00] goodness
[1:30:03] now
[1:30:07] he said if the first church that came
[1:30:09] out the vine was a Pentecostal church
[1:30:11] with all the gifts that was if that ever
[1:30:15] really puts forth another Branch they'll
[1:30:18] write a book of Acts behind it
[1:30:21] and what they had on the days of
[1:30:24] Apostles
[1:30:25] and the apostolic age never ended that
[1:30:29] you are in the apostolic age
[1:30:32] is still going on
[1:30:35] now bring it down to your life
[1:30:38] bring it right down to you personally
[1:30:40] individually now as a part of the body I
[1:30:43] want you to get this now we're speaking
[1:30:45] to the individual you know there's
[1:30:47] storms that are coming
[1:30:49] amen but oh I'm glad there's a hiding
[1:30:52] place
[1:30:53] amen a blessed hiding place in his
[1:30:56] Christ but now as you think of that
[1:30:58] blessed hiding place from Wrath remember
[1:31:01] there's no two hiding places just one
[1:31:05] you might be a member of some church
[1:31:08] can't hide from the devil there he'll
[1:31:10] get you
[1:31:10] amen we don't have nothing evil to say
[1:31:13] about church going go on to church
[1:31:15] but if that's all you have and your life
[1:31:18] isn't compared with the book of Acts
[1:31:21] um if the holy spirit that you profess
[1:31:24] is not making you live like they did in
[1:31:27] the book of Acts and your life could
[1:31:30] write another book you better take
[1:31:32] warning if the first Branch before the
[1:31:35] Pentecostal Church the second brancher
[1:31:38] Vine or Branch rather out of the vine
[1:31:40] will bring forth another Pentecostal
[1:31:43] church with a Pentecostal experience
[1:31:44] bearing the same fruits that the first
[1:31:47] church had
[1:31:50] so now we bring it down
[1:31:52] it's not just pulpit
[1:31:54] that needs to have the power of God
[1:31:59] it's the Pew that needs to have the
[1:32:01] power of God
[1:32:08] now we bring it down to you the
[1:32:10] individual
[1:32:11] you can hide in your seed in the church
[1:32:13] and say oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah it's
[1:32:16] there there's power to move
[1:32:18] hey you know there's Glory oh they're
[1:32:20] they're shouting there's this but what
[1:32:22] about you
[1:32:27] I want you to see not just the church
[1:32:29] planted by the rivers of Living Water
[1:32:31] but you're self-planted
[1:32:36] I want you to see yourself as a fruit
[1:32:39] Barrel
[1:32:44] because Jesus is very clear we don't
[1:32:46] bear fruit he said now if you're bearing
[1:32:48] fruit he said I'm going to purge you so
[1:32:51] you'll bear more God wants more fruit
[1:32:54] is not a good enough for God he wants
[1:32:57] more
[1:33:00] now so the tree that God planted it was
[1:33:03] to Bear nine different and nine
[1:33:06] different fruits of the spirit nine
[1:33:08] different kinds which means nine
[1:33:09] spiritual gifts nine fruits of the
[1:33:11] spirit that go with nine spiritual gifts
[1:33:13] that was God's tree and he planted on
[1:33:15] the day of Pentecost and David saw it
[1:33:18] and he said
[1:33:21] blessed is the man
[1:33:24] then we hear about blessings
[1:33:28] come on didn't we sing about this is
[1:33:30] your season
[1:33:31] blessed is the man
[1:33:34] amen and he said and this man shall be
[1:33:38] like a tree
[1:33:39] that is planted by Rivers plural
[1:33:44] of Living Water singular
[1:33:47] amen oh my now not the Methodist Baptist
[1:33:52] Presbyterian Lutheran whatever no rivers
[1:33:55] of one water
[1:33:57] nine spiritual gifts by The Same Spirit
[1:34:01] nine fruits of the spirit coming from
[1:34:04] the same channel
[1:34:06] you will be like a tree
[1:34:10] again the church will be like that but
[1:34:12] you need to see yourself there
[1:34:16] why is God restoring because the bugs
[1:34:19] have eaten down
[1:34:21] you see he was stripped of everything it
[1:34:22] had all the power all the joy all the
[1:34:25] good things that God gave it on the day
[1:34:26] of Pentecost they tore it out
[1:34:29] what department were made to can't go
[1:34:32] wormate or what he left the canker worm
[1:34:35] made and and then the Baptist took
[1:34:37] shouting away from the mouth of this and
[1:34:39] one eat this and one that and they
[1:34:41] stripped the church down until the
[1:34:43] guests got them sitting dead as a
[1:34:45] doornail
[1:34:47] no spirit
[1:34:49] and I'm quoting brother Branham no
[1:34:51] Spirit no shouting no joy no peace no
[1:34:54] healing no nothing
[1:34:57] don't let that describe your life
[1:35:01] don't let that describe your church
[1:35:04] amen
[1:35:06] one eat this one away one took that away
[1:35:08] and one took that away and so so if
[1:35:11] there is a restoration and that was what
[1:35:14] was taken away then the then it the
[1:35:18] church a restored church will have it
[1:35:20] shouting back the joy back the peace
[1:35:23] back the healing back the nine spiritual
[1:35:26] gifts back the fruits of the spirit back
[1:35:29] amen the Mysteries back everything back
[1:35:32] [Applause]
[1:35:34] that's a restored tree
[1:35:39] don't call it restored you just don't
[1:35:41] snag
[1:35:43] with no Freedom oh yeah well we got a
[1:35:45] snag
[1:35:48] you're dead twice and don't know it
[1:35:52] let me just say if Luther restored
[1:35:54] justification back
[1:35:56] and Wesley restored back sanctification
[1:35:59] and Azusa restored brought the
[1:36:02] restoration of the gifts now let me say
[1:36:05] this if they were restored they must be
[1:36:08] in the church
[1:36:13] Apostolic Doctrine must be in the church
[1:36:17] Paul's gospel has to return to the
[1:36:20] church
[1:36:22] again brother Madam would tell us he
[1:36:24] said one took baptism out one took joy
[1:36:26] out one took the Holy Ghost out one took
[1:36:28] healing out one to give South first
[1:36:30] thing you know you ain't got no more
[1:36:32] than an old dead Bleak bush
[1:36:35] standing there
[1:36:37] but under there somewhere
[1:36:40] God reserved Life coming on
[1:36:43] God said but there's still life in
[1:36:45] Christ
[1:36:47] and he said I'll have a church
[1:36:50] listen
[1:36:52] we will not leave here defeated
[1:36:58] Kate
[1:37:01] if he said I'll have a church without
[1:37:03] that the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[1:37:05] against
[1:37:06] we're going to have a church
[1:37:08] that Satan all won't know what to do
[1:37:10] with
[1:37:11] that Satan cannot Prevail against it
[1:37:15] Hallelujah
[1:37:18] in other words
[1:37:22] it won't wall off the promise of God
[1:37:24] from you
[1:37:27] you're taking your land and there's wild
[1:37:29] cities
[1:37:30] but those Gates of Hell will not prevail
[1:37:35] amen something's been held back from you
[1:37:38] this is your season to be blessed
[1:37:42] this is your season for the outpouring
[1:37:45] this is a season for the fullness
[1:37:48] amen and and the church and as long as
[1:37:51] there's an earth here God will have a
[1:37:54] church representing him Hallelujah
[1:37:57] let me read that again as long as there
[1:37:59] is an earth
[1:38:00] is there an earth that God will have a
[1:38:04] church representing him
[1:38:06] Hallelujah
[1:38:08] amen God will have a people
[1:38:12] he'll have a fruitful branch
[1:38:16] I will restore saith the Lord all the
[1:38:19] glory of the former days I will restore
[1:38:21] what the canker warm left I will restore
[1:38:23] healing I will restore the Holy Spirit
[1:38:25] I'll restore Joy I will restore
[1:38:27] everything that the first church had I
[1:38:29] will restore again in the last days
[1:38:32] and then he had
[1:38:34] and we're living in the last days
[1:38:38] so you're in the season
[1:38:41] to be blessed
[1:38:46] Hallelujah
[1:38:48] remember the burn over force that
[1:38:49] brother Brandon saw out hunting
[1:38:52] they reminded him of old dead churches
[1:38:54] groaning with their high spiers up there
[1:38:56] and they were just statues there looked
[1:38:59] like a big graveyard and tombstones and
[1:39:02] there when the wind blew it was grown
[1:39:04] and saying days of Miracles are passed
[1:39:07] and no such thing as Divine Healing and
[1:39:10] you know because he said the palm of
[1:39:12] worm ate all the blessings out of the
[1:39:14] church until there's no more hallelujahs
[1:39:17] there's no more praises to God
[1:39:20] there's no more Divine Healing speaking
[1:39:22] with tongues
[1:39:24] oh you can't say they're not churches
[1:39:26] but the life is going out of them
[1:39:29] they're withered Branch what the method
[1:39:31] has left the Baptists eat what the
[1:39:33] Baptist left the Presbyterian and say
[1:39:35] what the what the Presbyterians left the
[1:39:38] lutherans ate and brother they got it
[1:39:40] down taken out healing wouldn't take it
[1:39:41] out speaking in tongues one taking out
[1:39:43] all these other things until they ain't
[1:39:45] got nothing but a big old starchy thing
[1:39:46] to don't believe a thing the Bible says
[1:39:50] foreign now that would be a bleak
[1:39:52] picture
[1:39:54] but God showed him another group
[1:39:57] he saw coming up underneath them
[1:40:00] some little bitty trees
[1:40:03] Hallelujah amen and he saw the same wind
[1:40:07] that was causing him to grow was causing
[1:40:09] these other nephrolic
[1:40:11] Hallelujah they could Bend and move in
[1:40:14] the spirit of God and when the Holy
[1:40:16] Spirit moved they moved with it and they
[1:40:19] were just shouting and rejoicing
[1:40:22] oh Rejoice some church
[1:40:25] Hallelujah hey my mind will restore
[1:40:29] saith the Lord
[1:40:32] I want to say we're back
[1:40:35] [Music]
[1:40:36] we are here amen there is restored free
[1:40:41] by message of restoration
[1:40:45] I want to say brother Branham it wasn't
[1:40:48] in vain for you to come with a message
[1:40:52] of restoration let's restore my life
[1:40:55] it's restored family it's restoring
[1:40:58] Sanchez
[1:41:01] it's not in vain
[1:41:12] let me hear you let you hear from the
[1:41:15] prophet's word let me tell you brother
[1:41:17] God's going to raise up a generation of
[1:41:20] people out of all the debts
[1:41:23] going to restore
[1:41:25] saith the Lord
[1:41:33] I could speak in tongues right now
[1:41:37] God is going to raise the people who
[1:41:40] will believe in signs and wonders he's
[1:41:43] going to raise up people who's got joy
[1:41:46] unspeakable and full of glory and when
[1:41:49] the rusty Mighty Wind comes it gives
[1:41:51] right to it in frolics and dances and
[1:41:55] glorifies God
[1:41:57] [Applause]
[1:42:03] Hallelujah
[1:42:06] thank you Jesus
[1:42:09] ready
[1:42:17] the bark
[1:42:20] the bark
[1:42:22] the true and correct Doctrine has to be
[1:42:24] restored
[1:42:26] it's important
[1:42:28] as the Mark is a Lifeline or the sap
[1:42:32] that the sapphire the life of the tree
[1:42:34] flows through
[1:42:36] the Bible is the lifeline that's the
[1:42:38] spirit of God
[1:42:40] flows through the word
[1:42:43] so if the branches tore off the tree we
[1:42:45] got to get the bark back
[1:42:48] amen you know you can't have fruit on
[1:42:52] the tree till you grow the bark
[1:42:55] you know all you have to do to kill the
[1:42:57] tree you don't even have to cut it down
[1:42:59] just wring it all around
[1:43:03] trip to bark with a Lifeline next thing
[1:43:07] you know the leaves will wither
[1:43:09] the praise will be gone the Clapping of
[1:43:12] the hands are rejoicing
[1:43:15] come on the tree begins to die and it
[1:43:18] doesn't bring forth fruit
[1:43:22] and the scripture God's holy Bible is a
[1:43:24] Lifeline to any church
[1:43:27] so we know the Bible is the lifeline the
[1:43:29] word of God is a Lifeline you had to
[1:43:31] have the word restored
[1:43:33] not just shouting not just dancing not
[1:43:36] just no you got to get the bark back on
[1:43:39] the tree
[1:43:41] we got to have the original bark
[1:43:44] and the only way it can come back is
[1:43:47] when God grows it himself
[1:43:49] because men have tried to do it and
[1:43:51] that's what brother random taught us he
[1:43:53] said you know they stripped the original
[1:43:55] Doctrine and then they put a rag of some
[1:43:58] denominational Creed uh of infant
[1:44:02] baptism or sprinkling or father-son and
[1:44:05] holy ghost or you know all these other
[1:44:07] doctrines
[1:44:10] and there therefore he said but the Holy
[1:44:12] Spirit can't flow through the rag
[1:44:16] this is this is what's happened you know
[1:44:18] God gave us Restoration in this day and
[1:44:22] put the back on but then we get a you
[1:44:24] know this one coming out he's going to
[1:44:27] be the apostles and he's going to have
[1:44:28] the Thunders and he's going to be the
[1:44:30] next great man and you know he strips
[1:44:32] the true bark off him and then he puts a
[1:44:34] rag on
[1:44:35] then you have the Perugia comes along
[1:44:38] and they do the same thing you know they
[1:44:40] take away the original truth of the word
[1:44:43] of God and got to have a teacher now to
[1:44:45] bring Clarity and and whatever and the
[1:44:47] next thing you know they put a rag on it
[1:44:49] but the Holy Spirit won't flow to it
[1:44:51] that's why you can't have a book of Acts
[1:44:53] Church
[1:44:56] amen you got to come back to the
[1:44:58] original word the original sing that the
[1:45:02] the prophet of God preached that
[1:45:03] restored the word of God back to the
[1:45:06] sage
[1:45:07] remember
[1:45:08] only the on the only the power of God
[1:45:11] can grow it back to its original
[1:45:13] condition when you have the lifeline
[1:45:15] that's been cut off
[1:45:17] then you begin to lose the genuine
[1:45:19] fruits
[1:45:20] of patience and long-suffering goodness
[1:45:22] and meekness and gentleness
[1:45:25] and the first thing you know
[1:45:28] and let me just say
[1:45:30] if there's something comes in your life
[1:45:33] that cuts the lifeline of the Holy
[1:45:35] Spirit
[1:45:38] it won't be no time you lose your joy
[1:45:41] your peace your gentleness
[1:45:45] your patience
[1:45:47] your brotherly kindness and the next
[1:45:49] thing you'll be falling off the tree
[1:45:53] dead
[1:45:59] faith
[1:46:01] there must be a perfect faith
[1:46:04] brother Branham would tell us again he
[1:46:06] said he wanted to eat the fruit of the
[1:46:08] Faith Off faith in the word look how
[1:46:10] many times it's been translated this is
[1:46:13] what he wants to do to you he wants to
[1:46:14] come along you know with with some worm
[1:46:17] on a on some worm of a jebusite on a
[1:46:21] website
[1:46:24] take your faith away from the word of
[1:46:26] God from the message of the hour
[1:46:29] you know I mean sit around and try to
[1:46:31] pick out flaws of you know why he
[1:46:33] couldn't be the real Prophet you know he
[1:46:35] had too many human flaws
[1:46:38] are you telling me our Prophet was human
[1:46:40] I say amen he sure wasn't God
[1:46:45] you say he didn't learn he didn't
[1:46:47] increase in knowledge come on he was a
[1:46:49] man
[1:46:51] you got to understand God that used to
[1:46:54] man a man declared it
[1:46:57] amen and many will not believe because a
[1:47:00] man declared it
[1:47:02] so then they try to make him God and he
[1:47:05] wasn't God
[1:47:08] but he wants to eat the fruit of Faith
[1:47:10] he wants to cast doubt on the message
[1:47:12] get you to where you can see a flaw
[1:47:16] you know that's what he wants to do even
[1:47:17] the church he wants to point out the
[1:47:19] flaws in the ministry
[1:47:24] he wants to show you how human they are
[1:47:27] how they don't always make the right
[1:47:29] move
[1:47:33] you know how how did they you know that
[1:47:36] that they they're not uh they're just
[1:47:38] not perfect people
[1:47:41] you know if you're trying to tell me
[1:47:44] that I'm not God I'm not
[1:47:48] I'll help you out
[1:47:50] amen you know I know I'm not God
[1:47:54] no preacher is God come on
[1:47:57] we're humans but God takes the
[1:48:00] foolishness of preaching
[1:48:02] amen and uses the man of God to speak
[1:48:06] under inspiration and to lead the church
[1:48:12] but then when Satan wants to he wants to
[1:48:14] cast doubt on he said another one they
[1:48:17] ought to Aid off of and we've been
[1:48:18] through some of these but let me just
[1:48:20] pick it up briefly another he said they
[1:48:22] ate off the leaves which was Joy the joy
[1:48:25] of salvation
[1:48:27] you people make too much noise
[1:48:35] gets to a point that they don't even
[1:48:37] want rejoicing in the in the
[1:48:39] congregation don't want no amens and
[1:48:41] hallelujahs and glory to God brother
[1:48:42] Brandon said that's how I can see the
[1:48:44] spirit is moving
[1:48:47] amen you and you know what he said I had
[1:48:49] an old dog he said that wouldn't get
[1:48:51] after a skunk but he said if I patted
[1:48:54] him a little bit and said seek Him boy
[1:48:55] he'd go get after that stinker
[1:48:59] come on Amen you know it ain't just
[1:49:02] preaching alone it's the congregation
[1:49:05] responding back pulling on the gift of
[1:49:08] God Amen drawing from the fountain
[1:49:12] Bringing Down the anointing
[1:49:20] amen
[1:49:21] we need to hear sick and boy
[1:49:24] go get that devil you got him on the Run
[1:49:27] get him Tennessee
[1:49:29] tear him up
[1:49:33] restored me the joy of my salvation
[1:49:35] David cried
[1:49:38] notice
[1:49:39] this little Puma weren't beginning to
[1:49:41] eat the joy out
[1:49:42] you people make too much noise I can
[1:49:44] tell all this crime this sailing man is
[1:49:46] shouting not nonsense there's nothing to
[1:49:48] it and the first thing you know it's
[1:49:51] like a lot of message churches sitting
[1:49:54] around like in a big morgue
[1:49:56] all of them dead
[1:49:58] all the way from the pulpit to the back
[1:50:00] pew
[1:50:03] listen whatever you want you want to
[1:50:05] preach your anointed
[1:50:09] amen you want somebody that can find the
[1:50:12] flow of the spirit and be anointed by
[1:50:14] the holy Joseph speak the word of life
[1:50:18] amen because otherwise the church will
[1:50:21] just have cold Creeds pumped into them
[1:50:23] until until they're 40 below zero
[1:50:27] all right somebody say amen and
[1:50:30] everybody stretched their neck looking
[1:50:32] around who in the world is that you know
[1:50:34] like a goose and becomes a shame
[1:50:38] you know dean of a Lutheran college and
[1:50:40] don't don't tighten up on me now as I go
[1:50:42] down this road here
[1:50:44] because I I got a point to go
[1:50:46] Hey Dean of a Lutheran College asked
[1:50:49] brother Branham about those who shout
[1:50:51] and scream and kick out window lights
[1:50:55] said I've been all around and I've seen
[1:50:57] them kick over the tables and knock over
[1:50:59] chairs and turn and tear up the
[1:51:01] furniture and fall on the floor said
[1:51:03] what is that
[1:51:07] and brother Branham answered the Holy
[1:51:10] Ghost
[1:51:13] how many blasphemers out of there
[1:51:18] brother Brandon said the Holy Ghost
[1:51:21] and he said he
[1:51:23] said the Holy Ghost he said yeah
[1:51:27] they're blowing their steam all out the
[1:51:29] whistle
[1:51:30] instead of putting it together and
[1:51:32] making the wheels roll
[1:51:34] see if you'd ever get them to stop down
[1:51:36] to place and put some of that power in
[1:51:39] the Steam and the vows and make it push
[1:51:42] the card and have signs and wonders and
[1:51:44] miracles and great fire on Soul like
[1:51:47] that moving out it'd do something but
[1:51:49] they want to blow it out all out the
[1:51:51] whistle and that's just all there is to
[1:51:53] it it said it's good enough to show that
[1:51:56] got steam anyhow
[1:52:00] he said if they just knew how to put it
[1:52:03] to work they shout it all out and they
[1:52:05] scream it all out he said they're full
[1:52:07] of fire they're full of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:09] and they don't know how to settle it
[1:52:11] down on the word that says it's thus
[1:52:14] saith the Lord and they blow it all out
[1:52:16] the whistles and screams and shouts and
[1:52:18] runs it could ever bottle it down you
[1:52:20] see a church stand on her feet in power
[1:52:23] and Glory there'd be a book of Acts
[1:52:26] wrote behind it
[1:52:27] they take it out in joy into the power
[1:52:30] of Faith hold that there and believe it
[1:52:33] it's God's word stay with it
[1:52:36] notice what he said if you can only get
[1:52:39] that thing
[1:52:40] in operation
[1:52:42] the enthusiasm moving out you under the
[1:52:45] wind Souls it conquered the world
[1:52:49] therefore I think here's what he says
[1:52:52] are you ready for this
[1:52:55] I think even where we would call
[1:52:57] ourselves Pentecostals has failed to
[1:52:59] represent the real thing that Christ has
[1:53:03] set forth to represent
[1:53:05] for us to represent the Holy Spirit and
[1:53:08] the life of the spirit see we represent
[1:53:10] sometimes Sensations we represent joy
[1:53:13] and that's good but there's more to it
[1:53:16] than that there's a fruit that goes with
[1:53:19] it that hungry man that is looking for
[1:53:22] this fruit of the spirit and this is a
[1:53:24] quality that was in Jesus
[1:53:27] says they got plenty of steam that make
[1:53:30] the wheel that they'd make the wheel
[1:53:32] roll and do something but they'd blow it
[1:53:34] all out the whistle you see if they just
[1:53:36] put it down here where put her down here
[1:53:39] and they'd have signs and wonders and
[1:53:42] miracles and everything but they don't
[1:53:44] know what to do with it it's got to go
[1:53:46] somewhere so they just scream it out
[1:53:49] or blowing out
[1:53:51] listen to it now hmm I'd rather be
[1:53:54] blowing it out than holding it and not
[1:53:57] have any steam to blow out wouldn't you
[1:54:00] like the old fellas said I'd like to
[1:54:02] have a little Wildfire than no fire at
[1:54:05] all
[1:54:06] so you say that this Pentecostal Church
[1:54:08] would take a lot of his praises and put
[1:54:11] it to work it would do something for the
[1:54:13] kingdom of God God gave you the Holy
[1:54:15] Ghost you'd like to Shout by Praise by
[1:54:17] it but just put it in the gifts and
[1:54:20] wonders and go out in the street get the
[1:54:22] Sinners to come in things like that your
[1:54:24] church will grow and everything will go
[1:54:26] right along don't blow it out the wisdom
[1:54:28] put into action make the wheels roll the
[1:54:31] gospel train
[1:54:35] Hallelujah can you still a Say Amen
[1:54:39] but I just want to say some of you have
[1:54:42] been bound up so long
[1:54:45] that you just now got where you can even

[2:01:48] have been stripped to that peace
[2:01:52] I got a promise for you at that day you
[2:01:54] shall know
[2:01:57] foreign
[2:01:59] the father me and I knew
[2:02:02] why I actually met him
[2:02:04] it's no accepting by faith
[2:02:07] you know it is the the tree is peace of
[2:02:12] mind knowing that you're saved
[2:02:15] you know I he's not joining the church
[2:02:18] and you know you're saved
[2:02:19] you know our Hail Mary like the
[2:02:22] Catholics say or you got to have your
[2:02:24] name on this book well I'd take all the
[2:02:26] joy out of it
[2:02:28] you see you know you know brother
[2:02:30] Brandon's story about The Mule he said
[2:02:33] he's a hybrid he don't know who his pop
[2:02:34] and mama is that's a problem with the
[2:02:37] many people on message pews today they
[2:02:39] don't know who the pop and mama is
[2:02:41] but a good pedigree to horse knows who
[2:02:44] is Papa and mommy is through the
[2:02:46] generation and a real good pedigree
[2:02:48] Christian that has the Holy Ghost he
[2:02:51] knew it fell on the day of Pentecost and
[2:02:53] he knows where it's at he can trace his
[2:02:55] Generations back his genealogies to The
[2:02:58] First beginning of it Peter had it on
[2:03:00] down to the nation races we they've had
[2:03:03] it on down a good pedigreed Christian
[2:03:06] knows where it comes from
[2:03:10] amen I tell you what you just keep
[2:03:12] pressing on until you know
[2:03:16] [Music]
[2:03:17] well then the locusts come along and
[2:03:19] wants to destroy a Divine Fellowship
[2:03:22] that's right
[2:03:24] you know you didn't think it could
[2:03:25] happen in the message churches but first
[2:03:28] thing you know I'm Perugia I'm too Soul
[2:03:30] I'm seven Thunder I'm this I'm that we
[2:03:33] got you know he's old Nazarene this oh
[2:03:36] God's Pentecost talking you know we have
[2:03:38] nothing to do with them you don't have a
[2:03:40] meeting for Healing The Sick wall our
[2:03:42] church don't even believe that seed
[2:03:44] ain't The Season's heart no no
[2:03:46] you're wrong it's always in season
[2:03:49] amen you know so what did he do he cut
[2:03:52] the fellowship off like I said the
[2:03:54] canker worm took the took the bark off
[2:03:56] and first thing you know after he got
[2:03:59] them all dignified like we were talking
[2:04:01] about and he took the fellowship away
[2:04:03] from him form of a locust and now he
[2:04:05] comes along and they're very religion
[2:04:07] and makes dogmas out of it the message
[2:04:10] is not a law
[2:04:11] the message is the grace of God living
[2:04:13] in your heart
[2:04:15] Amen to me but he wants to come and
[2:04:18] strip that away take the take the the
[2:04:20] doctrine away brother Brandon said to
[2:04:23] mark his religion and I just want to say
[2:04:25] any religion without emotion is dead
[2:04:28] that's what your Prophet taught it's got
[2:04:31] to have the motion the the moving of the
[2:04:34] Holy Spirit through it
[2:04:35] so then he said the cake a worm next
[2:04:37] thing it took away was the baptism of
[2:04:39] the Holy Ghost because if you have that
[2:04:42] Holy Ghost it's going to shed light on
[2:04:44] the word
[2:04:45] so again the first revelation that you
[2:04:48] must have is to know who Jesus is
[2:04:52] when you know who he is he does like he
[2:04:54] did to Peter and thou art Peter amen he
[2:04:57] reveals to you who you are
[2:04:58] [Applause]
[2:05:00] hallelujah amen so there again that's
[2:05:03] what the new birth is
[2:05:05] it's a revelation of who God is he's my
[2:05:08] father
[2:05:09] I'm his child I am blessed because I
[2:05:12] belong to him
[2:05:14] hallelujah amen so so again you know
[2:05:17] here here would be the canker worm come
[2:05:19] along and oh he would replace it with a
[2:05:22] substitute
[2:05:23] in those days it was a ridiculous
[2:05:25] substitute this is how far they have
[2:05:28] strayed away from the book of Acts
[2:05:29] experience they started with a taking a
[2:05:33] wafer putting it on the tongue and say
[2:05:35] receive ye the Holy Ghost drink and then
[2:05:38] the priest drink the sip of wine
[2:05:42] the only stimulation it had it the
[2:05:45] priest got it
[2:05:51] but you got the Holy Ghost this is how
[2:05:53] you got it
[2:05:54] you know the Protestant come along and
[2:05:57] it was just coming join shake a hand
[2:05:59] look at Billy Graham's deal you know
[2:06:01] everybody who wants Christ walked down
[2:06:03] to the walk down to the front and fit
[2:06:06] his house and come and move
[2:06:08] Pentecostal you know instead of having
[2:06:10] the Holy Ghost they do the same thing
[2:06:13] you know join you know and come enjoy
[2:06:16] and shake a hand speak in tongues
[2:06:18] manufacture tongue you you know what
[2:06:21] message Community does it tells you
[2:06:23] you've got the Holy Ghost without
[2:06:24] knowing it
[2:06:26] you don't have to have the experience
[2:06:28] and that's no different than a Catholic
[2:06:30] communion or Baptist handshaker a church
[2:06:34] joining
[2:06:35] amen you know and now there's another
[2:06:37] personality cult it just says push play
[2:06:40] and you got it
[2:06:44] there wasn't somebody coming around and
[2:06:46] shook a hand
[2:06:47] in the upper room come on
[2:06:50] amen no there wasn't somebody come up
[2:06:53] and say join the church
[2:06:54] stick out your tongue here comes the
[2:06:57] sound of the priest down the aisle
[2:06:58] shuffling his feet and he's got the wine
[2:07:00] and the bread and says pick out your
[2:07:02] tongue and received all the ghost that's
[2:07:03] not how it came
[2:07:05] no that's not it but but what came down
[2:07:07] with a sound not of the priest
[2:07:10] amen by the sound of a Russian Mighty
[2:07:13] Wind that filled the house where they
[2:07:15] were sitting
[2:07:16] amen and it come right down to the
[2:07:19] leaves and poured over the bark and
[2:07:20] first thing you know they were all
[2:07:23] frolicking in the Holy Ghost
[2:07:25] amen
[2:07:27] don't you love that
[2:07:28] amen
[2:07:30] now as we just look at this for a moment
[2:07:33] you say but brother Tim
[2:07:36] but you see we're not in that season you
[2:07:39] see that was okay for them
[2:07:41] and that's all right for the back there
[2:07:44] but today
[2:07:46] we are in the opening of the word
[2:07:50] and so you know we have the knowledge of
[2:07:54] the gospel and the doctrines restored
[2:07:56] and so we're in the you know the word
[2:07:59] will open into the word we're beyond all
[2:08:02] of that
[2:08:03] and brother Branham said in the Feast of
[2:08:05] the trumpets
[2:08:07] brother Joe you read this the other
[2:08:08] night there will come a messenger in the
[2:08:11] last day
[2:08:12] will guide the people back to the first
[2:08:14] fruit
[2:08:15] back to the original Faith granted Lord
[2:08:18] that the great messenger Among Us the
[2:08:20] Great Christ the Holy Spirit made Vivid
[2:08:23] made understanding opening up the word
[2:08:26] and revealing it to us may he guide them
[2:08:29] back to original
[2:08:30] Pentecostal faith
[2:08:34] so think about this again is the opening
[2:08:37] of the word guides you back to the
[2:08:41] original
[2:08:42] Pentecostal faith not something
[2:08:45] different as he says and why little
[2:08:47] Bethlehem he said what we need today is
[2:08:51] an opening of the word that lives
[2:08:55] I see a lot of this we call an opening
[2:08:57] of the word to kills
[2:09:01] amen but we need one that lives
[2:09:05] somebody with me amen oh yeah they can
[2:09:08] say whatever they want to call it
[2:09:10] spiritus devil as long as the word is
[2:09:12] Flowing free and producing exactly what
[2:09:14] it's said to do is a fountain in the
[2:09:17] House of David again back in Bethlehem
[2:09:20] where that Jesus Christ the same
[2:09:23] yesterday today and forever to his
[2:09:25] Bethlehem dwellers live with it live in
[2:09:28] it it's a life journey in water for us
[2:09:31] as Israel had
[2:09:33] a tree planted
[2:09:37] not happenstance
[2:09:40] a tree planted by the rivers of Living
[2:09:43] Water
[2:09:46] brother Branham told us
[2:09:48] that are danger in this age
[2:09:51] was that we had got away from the living
[2:09:53] fountain
[2:09:56] notice a restored tree is restored
[2:10:00] because it is there planted by the
[2:10:04] rivers of Living Water
[2:10:07] it's got to house the resource to
[2:10:10] continually flow
[2:10:13] I want you to know in the dry times it's
[2:10:15] there in the in the drought is there in
[2:10:19] the springtime is there is all the time
[2:10:22] its Leaf doesn't wither
[2:10:25] because they're planted in the Fountain
[2:10:28] of Living Water
[2:10:31] amen notice again brother Madam would
[2:10:33] preach the sermon broken cisterns and he
[2:10:37] says in Jeremiah 2 13 for my people have
[2:10:40] committed to evil one they have forsaken
[2:10:43] me and I'm the Fountain of Living Waters
[2:10:46] and they have done second here's the
[2:10:49] other evil they have that sisters and
[2:10:52] then he says even some of them are
[2:10:53] broken cisterns that cannot hold water
[2:10:57] now of course again a cistern and then
[2:11:01] it becomes broken where it just really
[2:11:04] has nothing
[2:11:05] but as a cistern you see it's there in a
[2:11:09] cistern that parasites thrive in that
[2:11:13] old stale stagnant Waters
[2:11:15] you see they don't really live in the
[2:11:17] fresh water of the Holy Spirit
[2:11:20] that's why they're firmly against the
[2:11:22] word you see the message because it is a
[2:11:25] living water and the and and they
[2:11:28] parasites need a stagnated stream to
[2:11:32] swim in or wiggle in
[2:11:35] a stagnant pool
[2:11:38] are you still with me a stagnant pool
[2:11:40] becomes a home to wiggle tails
[2:11:43] unclean spirits like frogs
[2:11:46] tadpoles snakes and leeches
[2:11:50] when you see a man that is so filled
[2:11:53] with bitterness that it drives him out
[2:11:56] of church has no confidence and a god
[2:11:59] ordained a god-sent Ministry and
[2:12:02] criticizes the work of God always
[2:12:04] finding fault just remember it's an evil
[2:12:07] spirit that drives someone out of the
[2:12:11] house of God and it's because they are
[2:12:14] drinking from a stagnated pool
[2:12:19] that's why a continued renewing of the
[2:12:22] Holy Ghost is needed
[2:12:26] I want you to get it it's needed
[2:12:29] a continual renewing of bubbling up
[2:12:33] John 4 and 14 Jesus talked about the
[2:12:37] water that he provides he says that but
[2:12:41] who's ever drink into the water I shall
[2:12:43] give him shall never thirst but the
[2:12:46] water that I shall give him shall be in
[2:12:48] him a well of water springing up
[2:12:52] springing up
[2:12:56] everlasting life
[2:12:58] let me read to amplify it whoever drinks
[2:13:01] this water that I give him will never be
[2:13:04] thirsty again
[2:13:06] but the water that I give him will
[2:13:08] become in him a spring of water
[2:13:12] satisfying his thirst for God welling up
[2:13:15] continually flowing bubbling within him
[2:13:18] to a eternal life
[2:13:21] John 7 Jesus again in the last day in
[2:13:25] verse 37 John 7 37 the last day that
[2:13:29] that great day of the Beast how many
[2:13:31] beliefs were here
[2:13:32] the last day the great day of the feast
[2:13:35] Jesus stood and cried and said If any
[2:13:37] man thirst
[2:13:39] let him come to me and drink
[2:13:41] he that believeth on me as the
[2:13:44] scriptures I have said out of his belly
[2:13:47] shall flow Rivers
[2:13:50] of Living Water
[2:13:52] amen but this he speak of the spirit
[2:13:54] which they that believe on him should
[2:13:56] receive but the Holy Ghost was not yet
[2:13:59] given because Jesus was not yet
[2:14:01] glorified you see parasites cannot grow
[2:14:06] in that water
[2:14:08] they cannot Thrive there
[2:14:10] bitterness and fault finding it just
[2:14:13] keeps flushing it out
[2:14:17] amen keeps flushing it out
[2:14:20] little Ops against one another keeps
[2:14:22] just flushing out it can't Thrive there
[2:14:25] when you've got the Holy Ghost bubbling
[2:14:28] up it keeps pushing out enmity and
[2:14:31] jealousy and strife and bitterness and
[2:14:35] fussing and fighting and quarreling and
[2:14:38] brings a Unity
[2:14:40] of the spirit
[2:14:44] that's why brother Branham told us in
[2:14:46] Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[2:14:48] said now he said to love one another
[2:14:52] no matter what the devil tries to say
[2:14:54] you're all one great big sweet group now
[2:14:56] but remember my warning Satan won't let
[2:14:59] it stay that way no sir he'll shoot
[2:15:02] he'll shoot everything if he's got to
[2:15:05] bring somebody in to make his Target
[2:15:07] he'll bring some critic or unbelievery
[2:15:10] end set him down and cause him to
[2:15:12] fellowship with you under quietness of
[2:15:14] things then he'll shoot that guy with
[2:15:15] some kind of poison stuff he'll start
[2:15:17] right through the church with him don't
[2:15:19] you take sides with it
[2:15:21] don't you have nothing to do with it you
[2:15:24] stay right loving and sweet and kind
[2:15:27] with one another pray for that man that
[2:15:29] he'll be saved to or that woman whoever
[2:15:31] it is just pray for them stick close
[2:15:34] together stay with your pastor he's your
[2:15:36] Shepherd and you give him your respects
[2:15:39] he'll lead you through and cause he's
[2:15:42] ordained of God to do so
[2:15:44] now you remember that the enemy will
[2:15:47] come and when he does his clean that
[2:15:48] much closer together and the one that
[2:15:50] the devil is using for an enemy will
[2:15:52] either get out or come in and be one of
[2:15:54] you that's all don't ever Clan among one
[2:15:57] another talk make yourself planets we
[2:15:59] are one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad
[2:16:02] at you I'm going to take you away
[2:16:04] because you're not a right hand he's my
[2:16:06] left hand I want it to stay there every
[2:16:09] little chip of my finger I want to stay
[2:16:11] there I want it to stay right there
[2:16:13] every little part of my body stay right
[2:16:16] there and God wants us as a body
[2:16:18] believer to stay right exactly with one
[2:16:20] another right with one another
[2:16:22] you got the dictates on discipline in
[2:16:25] the church how we behave ourselves in
[2:16:27] the Church of God how we come here
[2:16:29] together sit together in Heavenly places
[2:16:31] don't stay home if God's in your heart
[2:16:35] you can hardly wait
[2:16:37] for them doors to open out yonder to get
[2:16:40] in here to fellowship with your brothers
[2:16:42] if you don't feel that way then I tell
[2:16:45] you it's time that you get to praying
[2:16:47] because we're in the last days where the
[2:16:49] Bible exhorted us that much more we see
[2:16:52] that day approach it to love one another
[2:16:54] with Christian love and divine love to
[2:16:56] assemble ourselves together in Heavenly
[2:16:58] places in Christ Jesus and love one
[2:17:01] another and this shall all men know
[2:17:02] you're my disciples when you have love
[2:17:04] for the other
[2:17:06] stay right together and if the brother
[2:17:08] you think he's a little wrong with his
[2:17:10] sister you say Lord don't never let me
[2:17:13] have a root of bitterness spring up
[2:17:16] because it'll affect him it'll take the
[2:17:18] Christ right out of my life that poison
[2:17:21] acids of malice and jealousy and hatred
[2:17:24] that'll take the Holy Spirit right from
[2:17:26] you it'll run him from the Tabernacle
[2:17:28] here it'll kill the spirit of God or
[2:17:30] drive it away from here hurts your
[2:17:32] pastor it'll do anything don't you do
[2:17:34] that you just whacked that much closer
[2:17:37] together
[2:17:38] top nights about one another say nice
[2:17:41] things about one another and then God
[2:17:44] will bless you
[2:17:47] Hallelujah this is what God has said to
[2:17:50] the church amen what is don't let
[2:17:53] bitterness come in don't let little odds
[2:17:56] come in
[2:17:58] we're all human
[2:18:00] we're subject to those things but that's
[2:18:03] what the holy spirit is for to boil that
[2:18:05] out
[2:18:07] don't let it take a route
[2:18:10] amen listen
[2:18:14] I was in Israel some years ago which is
[2:18:16] where I got this
[2:18:18] this topic on the people of the book
[2:18:21] because the people of the book
[2:18:24] the Bible
[2:18:26] the Jews
[2:18:28] they had returned to the land of the
[2:18:29] book
[2:18:32] while we were there we went to the Dead
[2:18:33] Sea
[2:18:36] and the Dead Sea is known in the Hebrew
[2:18:39] as the sea of death
[2:18:43] is also called The Sea of lot
[2:18:48] is also called the lake of Sodom
[2:18:52] the salt in the Dead Sea is as high as
[2:18:55] 35 percent nearly 10 times more than
[2:18:59] normal ocean water
[2:19:03] and all that saltiness
[2:19:05] is meant there's no life in it
[2:19:09] no fish
[2:19:11] no vegetation
[2:19:13] no sea animals nothing lives in it
[2:19:17] that Dead Sea
[2:19:20] that's where it gets his name
[2:19:23] see
[2:19:26] just north of there is another sea
[2:19:29] it's called the Sea of Galilee
[2:19:32] I ate fish out of that sea
[2:19:36] I went there and took a boat
[2:19:40] and I got out in the in the boat there
[2:19:42] and we were out there where with the
[2:19:44] testimony on the sea and we played that
[2:19:47] part of the tape and the spirit of God
[2:19:48] just come down and we just had a jubilee
[2:19:51] as we looked around and see him these
[2:19:54] are the mountains Jesus looked at this
[2:19:57] is the sea Jesus there's the the towns
[2:20:00] there's the there's where the maniac was
[2:20:02] there was this one there's that one
[2:20:04] there's this
[2:20:05] all of these Miracles that had taken
[2:20:07] place
[2:20:09] and I'm right here in the sea
[2:20:12] the Sea of Galilee is just North of the
[2:20:14] Dead Sea
[2:20:16] both the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee
[2:20:20] received their water from the same
[2:20:23] source
[2:20:25] one of them is that source is a river
[2:20:28] Jordan but
[2:20:30] very very different
[2:20:33] the Sea of Galilee is resplendent with
[2:20:35] Rich and colorful marine life there's
[2:20:37] lots of plants lots of fish
[2:20:40] there's life in it
[2:20:43] the same region same source of water
[2:20:47] yet one
[2:20:48] see is full of life
[2:20:52] and the other is the Sea of death
[2:21:00] the water
[2:21:02] River Jordan flows to the Galaxy of
[2:21:04] Galilee and it flows out of it
[2:21:08] you hear what it said it flows in and
[2:21:12] flows out
[2:21:13] and that keeps the sea healthy and
[2:21:16] vibrant and teeming with marine life
[2:21:20] because it's constantly being fleshed
[2:21:23] out
[2:21:24] New Life coming in
[2:21:27] vigorating water coming in but not only
[2:21:29] that it's being pushed out and goes out
[2:21:32] and flows out to water hundreds of Acres
[2:21:36] elsewhere
[2:21:38] its light goes out bringing life many
[2:21:41] other places
[2:21:42] the Dead Sea takes its water from the
[2:21:45] River Jordan and it holds it
[2:21:49] you see it's below sea level
[2:21:52] and all of it and it has no Outlet so it
[2:21:56] just all flows into it it's always
[2:21:58] flowing in and flowing in and flowing in
[2:22:00] and flowing in and flowing in
[2:22:03] but there's no Outlet flowing out
[2:22:07] some people's religion is a Dead Sea
[2:22:15] that's all they are
[2:22:17] they're just a collection of quotes
[2:22:20] scriptures this and that and the other
[2:22:24] but they're dead
[2:22:26] there's no reinvigorating life
[2:22:29] it's not giving birth
[2:22:31] it's an Optimum with life there's no
[2:22:34] refreshing coming again flowing through
[2:22:37] it it's just it just becomes stagnant
[2:22:39] What flows in it becomes stagnated
[2:22:43] well I'm trying to get into a picture
[2:22:45] Jesus said the Holy Spirit would not be
[2:22:48] like a Dead Sea
[2:22:51] it would be a river of Living Water
[2:22:55] let's see now purging out pushing out
[2:22:58] the parasites pushing out the unbelief
[2:23:01] pushing out the bitterness the doubt the
[2:23:04] fear all of that is going to have a flow
[2:23:09] Hallelujah
[2:23:11] amen oh yeah the Dead Sea can get choppy
[2:23:15] when the wind blows but you know you
[2:23:17] know just dancing ain't gonna do it
[2:23:19] church it's got to have a flow out
[2:23:22] what the sick are healed the dead or
[2:23:25] raised miracles happen Deliverance come
[2:23:29] we gotta have a Rapture in this age
[2:23:32] we gotta have a people with not just
[2:23:34] Faith but a Rapture in faith
[2:23:43] but I got some good news for you
[2:23:46] the Dead Sea will not always be dead
[2:23:50] in Ezekiel chapter 47 and verse 9 it
[2:23:54] speaks of its restoration too it says
[2:23:57] swarms of living creatures will live
[2:23:59] wherever this river flows there will be
[2:24:02] large numbers of fish because the water
[2:24:04] flows there and makes the salt water
[2:24:06] Fresh So Where the River Flows
[2:24:09] everything will live
[2:24:11] hallelujah amen I'm telling you I don't
[2:24:15] care how long you've been dead
[2:24:20] Hallelujah I will restore saith the Lord
[2:24:24] Hallelujah I'm gonna throw the Holy
[2:24:27] Spirit through this bride she will not
[2:24:30] be a sea of death serious yet life feel
[2:24:34] pretty much alive
[2:24:43] your experience with God may have been a
[2:24:46] genuine experience
[2:24:48] but you can't let that get old and
[2:24:52] stagnant
[2:24:53] [Applause]
[2:24:55] manner could not last another day it
[2:24:58] bred worms and stank even though it was
[2:25:00] real mamma
[2:25:02] but if you come into the holiest of
[2:25:04] holies
[2:25:05] in the Shekinah Glory that same manner
[2:25:08] would last forever
[2:25:11] to every Generations
[2:25:13] parasites of unbelief have got to be
[2:25:16] flushed out
[2:25:18] fear parasites of bitterness
[2:25:22] parasites of complacency
[2:25:24] and
[2:25:26] and satisfaction where you just
[2:25:28] satisfied where you're at
[2:25:34] all of that's got to be flushed out
[2:25:37] your mama
[2:25:39] cannot become stink
[2:25:45] it must be fresh
[2:25:47] your River has to flow
[2:25:54] and if you'll further your experience in
[2:25:56] the holiest of holies
[2:25:58] stay in this kind of Glory
[2:26:00] your Manna will always be fresh
[2:26:04] but when you get so full of stagnation
[2:26:07] lovers of stagnation
[2:26:10] when somebody when we try to when when
[2:26:13] the word comes and tries to get you
[2:26:15] respond move in the spirit let it flow
[2:26:19] through you let it move in your life and
[2:26:21] you resist
[2:26:23] you become a stagnated stream
[2:26:29] broken cisterns
[2:26:31] see denomination make stagnant pools
[2:26:35] where men can live with women then women
[2:26:37] can carry on Cutters hair and swear
[2:26:40] shorts and everything else and call
[2:26:41] themselves Christians
[2:26:43] the same thing can happen in a message
[2:26:45] community
[2:26:46] where the church has become a stagnant
[2:26:49] pool and unclean spirits a pornography
[2:26:52] and divorce remarriage every kind of
[2:26:56] unclean spirit is going on
[2:27:01] but as we close this morning I want to
[2:27:03] just close on a on a real positive
[2:27:06] thought
[2:27:08] and of course as we come to that I want
[2:27:12] you to remember
[2:27:13] there's all kinds of things that will
[2:27:15] try to stop up your will
[2:27:18] beaver dams that will come
[2:27:21] that's why preachers have to Beaver
[2:27:24] beaver dam blowers
[2:27:26] blow up those dams
[2:27:29] dams of unbelief and doubt and fear and
[2:27:32] everything else blow them out with a
[2:27:35] dynamite power of the word of God and
[2:27:38] let the word of God flow
[2:27:42] brother Branham said we got too many
[2:27:44] Beaver Dam preachers today
[2:27:47] that once said but he said get the logs
[2:27:49] out of your experience
[2:27:53] and I'm closing on this scripture
[2:27:56] Second Kings 3 19.
[2:28:00] here's where
[2:28:01] Elijah told them to to dig the valley
[2:28:05] full of ditches
[2:28:08] the more you dig out
[2:28:11] the deeper you make it
[2:28:13] the more you get rid of yourself
[2:28:16] the more the holy spirit is going to
