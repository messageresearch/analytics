presence today truly your presence is overwhelming Lord oh yes and Lord we come to you this morning in an atmosphere of worship a spirit of worship Lord to we can Lord step aside from our own ideas and our own Humanity Lord and our Natures but God we want to present to you today a worship that is pleasing unto thee Lord the songs of adoration has been sung we've lifted up our voice in Praise but father now the word will come forth and it's a Time of worship Lord where we would pull on the gift of God and Lord you would direct our thoughts to the hearts the needs of the people Lord and I just ask this morning Father you would direct as only you can that there be a spirit here oh God that would Minister to every Life Touch every heart every situation and God Not only would there be a spirit here that would do that but Lord there would be a people here that will respond to the word and they would begin to pull on the gift Lord that you have placed in a man's life and from that gift you would pull you to their need and their situation so we ask that you direct our thoughts this morning Lord we pray you'll anoint our hearts to receive Lord anoint the mouth of the servant the ears of the hearer Lord that we both can be in tune with your spirit for we ask it this morning in the name of Jesus Amen certainly great to be here with you this this morning if you have your Bibles we're going to look here in the Book of Psalms 95 we'll start at verse one bring greetings to you from Brother Andrew Glover as was on the phone with him this morning working out some arrangements he and I are going to be going to California in a couple weeks to San Diego holding some meetings there for an all Spanish group I've been there several times myself so just in ask that you would be in prayer for us that we can follow the leadership of the Lord and the people will be blessed and you know this is not about oursel who we are but it's about who he is and what he's called us to do and so if You' just be in prayer for us with that but he does send his greetings and to bring greetings also from Brother Joseph Hammond there in murbo Tennessee we were with him last week and had a tremendous time with the young people but today we're at home and we're with God's elect not that they're not the elect of God but we're home and you know it's No No Greater Joy than being at home amongst your people those that know you and those that you have conf in so we just going to turn to him this morning and I want to speak to you on created for worship created for worship we find here in Psalms 95 says oh come let us sing unto the Lord and let us Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our Salvation let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms for the Lord is a great God and a great king above all gods in his hands are the Deep places of the Earth the strength of the hills is his also the sea is his he made it and in his hands formed the dry land oh come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the Lord Our God for he is our God and we are his people of his pasture the Sheep of his hand God bless you you can have your seats this morning I'd also like to look at in Genesis 1 and I I prefaced this here I actually brought this scripture out when I spoke to you on the word we bring forth but I want to look at this again just briefly this morning as we get in to kind of help build our our our platform for the message today it says then God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth and then in verse 27 so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them then in Genesis 2 and verse 7 for our last scripture reading this morning well it won't be the last but it's going to be the last before we get started so and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul so we find that man was the last of all of God's creations you believe that this morning so God continued advancing in his creation until finally he created one that was in His image and of all the cre creatures that were created man was the only one that looked like God man was the only one that was in the image of God and we find in Genesis 1:28 that God blessed that creation and that that word blessed there means to be praised to be saluted to be adored so God essentially stepped back and and he adored or he poured adoration upon his creation because now this is the one in which I had a purpose of creating so we find that in the beginning before there was ever before anything was ever created God desired to have a family the prophet of God tells us that so you and I were in his thoughts way back then before you ever came forth you was in the thoughts of God before you ever gave your heart to the Lord you were in the thoughts of God before you ever committed the first sin or made the first mistake you were in the thoughts of God so before these things you were in God's thoughts and you were in his mind and God longed to have fellowship with you and and God longed to receive worship from you so we find here see God longed to have worship he desired something or someone that would worship him he desired a people that would love him amen so we look notice now God's desire for for a family was now becoming into manifestation because now in Genesis 2 we find that he formed man and he breathed the breath of life into man so now man can worship God so he created all boty life and it was good he created the waters and they were good he created the Earth and it was good but it wasn't until he created man that he blessed his creation so that tells me there's something about man that God Longs for or something that God placed in man that he Longs for that sets man a far and above all his other creatures see only man can love God the way God desired to be loved see man is the only one of God's cre creatures or Creations that has a place or a soul and in that Soul they can love God and they can worship from that soul and from that heart only man is that one that has that so there's something something special about man there's something special about each of you that's here this morning so only man can worship God the way God intended to be worshiped so God created man for worship and he placed in the heart of man a desire to worship God placed in your heart this morning a desire for worship when you was young maybe 8 nine 10 years old how many of you had a desire to serve God but yet you you still strayed and you still did things in the world but yet there was something inside of you you wanted to serve God because God deposited inside of you right there a desire to worship him so when God desire to to he desired to be an object of worship His desire was to receive worship from his creation this word worship here we're going to take our time this morning but we're going to get through this but the word worship here means to prostrate especially reflectively in homage or Roy to royalty or to God to Bow self down it didn't say about exalting self and self ideas and me over you but it says to Bow self down to crouch to fall down flat humbly Bes seits to do reverence to make to stoop in our day in our age that's a very difficulty to do cuz now man is all about himself man's a lover of pleasure more than is a lover of God he's about who he is what he can do what he can be you know he's not in the position or in the uh the yeah the position to fa favorably bow himself down and to Humble himself before another man or another creature or God see man it's in man man today wants to be lifted up but God is calling for man to crouch down to bow down to lay yourself prostrate and worship him and him alone and the prophet of God will tell us God wants to be worshiped the word god means an object of worship and he says and it's God trying to condition his people so he can get from them what he created them for so God created you for worship and God is trying to condition you so that he can get from you what he created you for and he created you to worship him he didn't create you to worship your job he didn't create you to worship your spouse he didn't create you to worship the church he created you to worship him let me just say it like this he didn't even create you to worship another man but God created you to worship him and him alone listen what he says here he says now in the beginning God take that name God in the Hebrew we find it spelled l El Elohim which means the all self-existing one the all sufficient one the strong one there was nothing before that there was no air there was no stars there was no moisture there was no there was no atmosphere there was no atoms there was no molecules there was nothing before that that's right come on Church see it was God the Eternal one and in him were attributes to be a savior to be a father to be God a lot of times we hear Brother bam say you know God had these attributes to be healer and to be a deliverer and to be a savior and to be a father but we find here now he has even in this one he has an attribute to be God an object of worship and see he said then he wasn't God then he was just he was God but there was nothing else that could worship so God is an object of worship and there is nothing to worship him he wants to be worshiped that's his very nature is to be worshiped because he is God so we're we're going to look today and we're going to find out what really is worship and I'm not sending text messages I'm adjusting my volume just so everybody's aware I want y'all think I'm socializing up here as I preach but I got got to get this volume right he says here but being that he was God then there must be something to worship him because he loved worship I wonder if we can love worship worship to him as much as he loves to receive your worship he loves worship His Own being created creatures to worship him but then because that he was God he made the angels and the angels worshiped him notice when he made the Angels they were different than you and I everybody should have said amen unless you're consuming that you're a chair of them this morning and you got wings and you're ready to fly but notice we find in the scriptures that there were two Wings over their face two Wings over their feet and with two Wings they did fly and they were in the presence of God day and night crying holy holy holy unto God and yet that was creation and yet they became uh those that would worship God and now he was God now he was to be worshiped but yet there was something still missing there was something that God was still Desiring that the Angels couldn't provide God was looking for somebody God was looking for a man God was looking for creation that would love him from their own desires and many times we wonder what is my purpose in life brother Joe why am I here why did God create me he created you to worship him he created you to not just sit on a Pew not just to have a nice career and make a lot of money or drive fancy cars wear nice clothes have a thousand friends on Facebook Facebook or Instagram or SnapChat or Tik Tok or whatever it is but God created you and I to worship him and to him alone so the first thing he created though he created the Angels but there was something missing that the Angels didn't have see he placed the angels in an atmosphere or or uh not an atmosphere but the word I'm looking for just sking but they couldn't do anything but worship God but you and I he placed us free moral agents and that word free moral agency not to dumb it down but it means a free moral agent is someone who can understand right from wrong and therefore can be held responsible for their actions in addition they have free will to make their own decisions based on their understanding of ethical decisions and the prophet of God will tell us notice he says now in the beginning God know that man will fall therefore he could put him on free moral agency knowing because he could display his attributes to be a father to be a son to be a Healer to be a savior and he says notice that there was nothing lost there could be nothing saved and before there was an angel or a molecule or anything God was by himself alone but he wasn't God cuz God's an optical worship there was something in him for worship but nothing to worship him but the attributes were there and he had an attribute to be God and he wanted somebody to worship Him from a free moral agent standpoint he made man gave him free moral agency and he fell and then when he fell he became a savior and in the fall he took sickness so he become a Healer see it's displaying God's attributes all the time but God God created something in US therefore he created man in his own image for a purpose so that you and I can do what angels can do you know the Angels can't sing the song that we can sing the Angels can't sing the song of the redeemed they can't worship when we're on the other side to worship him they're going to stand around and watch as the host of of the redeemed are gathered together and we begin to worship God because what he done for us that he lifted us up out of the my clay he lifted us up out of Le de he took a bride in a ratcher and they're going to stand back because they don't understand what moves us and why we worship God the way we worship all that they can do is cry holy holy holy unto the Lord but you and I can fall down and worship God but for what he's done for us and who he is and who we are in God and God is Desiring your worship and the angels can't provide the worship that God desires from you this morning only you can give God what he desires a heart full of worship and see you and I have a choice the Angels don't have a choice in the matter you had a choice to come to church this morning many others had the same choice and we see a lot of seats vacant but you made your choice to come into the house of God to worship see we have a choice if we're going to serve him we got a choice this morning if you're going to worship him see every service you come you you can go through the formality but that not be worshiped you can dress you can put your smell good on you can get your hair all did up did up y'all like how I said that come all your pumping fashion got your new dress woo your new suit your new tie your good look your new buzz on your haircut you can come with all that and still not be worshiping oh you may say Amen or you may sing the songs but something in your heart is lacking we're going to get deeper into this but notice see worship has to be a revelation a worship has to be something that's revealed to you what pleases God not what pleases you because all of us are different and the house said amen you know none of you are like me and I'm not like a lot of you but yet we're all nature different we got different personalities some of you are extroverts some of you have introverts some of you are just verts you got it somewhere in between but we're all different but yet God has required all of us in all our differences and how we're made notice worship is a denial of self well brother Joe it's not my nature well I know not your nature but God don't care about your nature God is Desiring your worship God is Desiring you to lay yourself down bow yourself humble yourself when you come into the presence of God and offer him what he desires well it's just not in me to shout it's not in me to just dance around and it's not all about emotion I get that we're going to go a little bit further but notice worship is a revelation we go back to Cain and Abel the two brothers and we find that Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice why because he didn't have a Bible that told him what he needed to do he didn't have blueprints he didn't have somebody there standing over his shoulder you need to do this this and this but no it was a revelation it was revealed to Abel what pleased God and so he brought to God what it was and we find Cain he followed what his brother did he did exactly he presented an altar came to church he dressed right he read the same scriptures he you know he sang out of the same song book but he did what he thought pleased God and he did he brought the fruit of the ground versus the lamb versus blood and we find that he God was not pleased with Cain's worship so if God only required worship then he was unjust to condemn Cain but God requires the right kind of worship God desires those to worship Him to do it in spirit and in truth not in formality see true worship has a foundation and that Foundation is a revelation and it's by faith that we walk by faith amen so when you worship when your worship is more than just coming to the church or going to special meetings when your worship is more than just professing to be a Christian or a good person see your wor got to be something that's revealed to you that you're a son and daughter of God and you know who he is and because you know know who he is then you know who you are and when you know your relationship with God then you can honor offer God a honest Heart of Worship cuz you're not worried am I saved am I not saved am I filled am I not filled am I a son or a daughter am I not a son or daughter of God you know your position you know your place see the true worship is to know who God is he's not a god of History where we find him only on the shores of Galilee and he did great Miracles 2,000 plus years ago but yet we can't reach that God today yet he doesn't hear our prayers today yet he's not with us today he still is among us see he's not a god of man's making where he's limited by what he can do because of man's limitations you find today many preachers were guilty we want to put God in a box many people we're Believers we're guils we want to put God in a box say he can only do thus thus does but in the messages identify Christ of all ages the prophet of God will tell us now we do believe that God can do things that's not written in his word because he's God he does whatever he wishes so who are we as man to limit God in what God can do just because we may have never seen it happen before so he's a Creator and he desires your worship he Desir desires your adoration he desires your praise and they that will worship God will do it in spirit and in truth they don't bring to him what they think might please him not how many scriptures you memorized not how many times you read the Bible through and through and that is good not how many church services you came to before you miss one you know God ain't looking at your church attendance but you need to attend church we go ahead and put that out there see it's not an intellectual understanding but it's a revelation God has reveal to your heart how you can please him how you can serve him how you need to worship him and it's a spirit revealed worship notice when he was met the woman at the well we go to John 4 and verse 19 this morning John 4:19 the woman saith unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet so she recognized that there was something different about this man she says our fathers Worship in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is a place where men ought to worship and Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither worship or when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father you worship you know know what but we worship what but we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him verse 24 and God is the spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and I believe that this is the hour that Jesus was speaking of the hour cometh and now is notice she tried to point worship to a mountain tried to point it to a certain location tried to point it to well you got to do it this way and you got to be legalistic about it and you can't worship God freely and this is what we've been taught this is where we've been taught but Jesus trying to get her attention off of that he's trying to show her it's not in a mountain somewhere it's not in Jeffersonville it's not in Nashville it's not in streetport Louisiana but those that worship God must do it in spirit and in truth and take the location out of it take take the denomination off of it take the ideas and creas and dogmas off of it and worship God the way God desires to be worshiped see now is that day now is the age where the spirit that was poured out on the day of Pentecost has once again been poured out on the end time bride and the truth that's been lost down through Seven Ages has now been finally tied all together all the loose sins of the scriptures had been tied together to make one glorious message and today we find finally have the spirit and the truth come again now there's a people in the land now there's a bride on the scene that can worship God not in a location but in spirit and in truth cuz they see God in his word and the truth lines up to the word and he says I am the word and I am the truth and I am the life that's what we're here to worship we're not here to worship man and man's ideas but we're here to worship God and God created you for such worship he created you brother R would tell us whatever the spirit of God leads you to do he won't lead you to do anything but what's right he's the spirit and God is the spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth notice so God likes to be worshiped well it's not my nature God likes to be worshiped well I done heard that song Too Many Times God likes to be worshiped well I'm not feeling good today God oh come on God likes to be worshiped but if you just knew what I was going through it doesn't matter God likes to be worshiped I wonder sometimes if we can take our eyes and our our minds and all the gigl and all that out of just coming to the house of God and passing notes and chatting with our neighbor and maybe giggling and laughing because something may be funny and just really set all that aside and worship God not just during the song service or during the special or when somebody cracks up cracks up cracks and maybe the special don't go the way it should and we just kind of giggle and laugh that's not worship that's not pleasing to God at all but God is looking for men and women Sons and Daughters to worship Him and come in and create an atmosphere where it's not on some man it's not on some song leader it's not on some preacher but you come with a heart so full of love and you can't wait to worship God and to pour out your worship into the presence of almighty God so that God can come by and bless you and your sacrifice I wonder if the message has come too common to us that your neighbor too common that our church is too common that the ministry has become so common so we don't recognize the opportunity that's given us when we come into the house of God this ain't about me this ain't about Tim puit Timothy puit Aaron it ain't about none of you it's about him and there's one thing that God does desires out of each of us you may be rich you may be poor you may be Skin and Bones you may be fat and happy I don't know we you may have hair not hair but it doesn't matter we got all our differences but God desires one thing from every heart in this building and those on the stream and those out there from his bride he desires worship and he Longs for it and those that the father seeketh must worship him there's no choice they must worship ship him in spirit and in truth that's right brother R would say this and I think this is just so so pertinent we can exercise our faith in him believe it and not be ashamed to tell others about it that Jesus Christ raised from the dead lives and Reigns in the hearts and we're not ashamed of it doesn't that make your face or don't does it make your face R to testify the glory of Jesus Christ for he is worthy of all praise don't you believe that that he's worthy of all praise so God likes to be worship His CH his children that we can be free notice we can be free and not bound down by yolks do you realize today that you can let somebody's critical view of your worship be a Yol to you or you can let some man's idea how a service should be conducted be a yoke to you and bind you and quench the spirit of God I understand there's some of us that are very emotional there's some of us that are not emotional but never should we come into the house of God and be critical and let that become a yoke to quench the spirit and the movement of God when God has desire and worship see that we when we worship God has got to be done in the right way not fussing over who's right who's wrong my interpretation of the scriptures versus your interpretation of the scriptures God is his own interpreter of the scriptures and God does it by bringing it to pass we're not fussing over uh denominational ideas but we love God and when this woman at the well came she pointed to a place and a lot of times we want to point to something or somebody some event something and this is where we got it and you know what when we leave off from there this is where I met God and she's noticing here so to her worship was a law we have to do it over there in that mountain we can only worship God in Jeffersonville we can only worship God in Tucson we can only worship God at even like T we can only worship God if you get my tapes come on now know we try to point to some location but but God's omnipresent God's everywhere now he ain't worried about some specific location the same God that's moving here this morning is the same God that's moving in Virginia the same one that's moving in Ohio he's the same one that's moving around the world and God is seeking worshippers to worship Him in spirit get your minds off a location get your minds off your favorite preacher get your minds off your favorite church and get your minds on Christ Jesus and over him a Heart of Worship that's what he's hungering for this morning see this mount gism it was just a little away from Saar which is where the Samaritans worship and on this mountain they built a temple somewhat similar to the one in Jerusalem Jacob built an altar on this mountain and he worshiped God there they said that send ballot by the permission of Alexander Great he built a temple upon Mount Garrison so she can point to this is where these things happen this is where Jacob built an altar or Jacob built a yeah an altar there and send bot he built a temple there but God was trying to show her get your eyes off a location get your eyes off a man and look at the one that's in front of you we find in John 4:10 Jesus answered and he said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God if thou knewest the gift of God and who it was that saith to thee give me a drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would give thee Living Water so he's trying to direct her attention off of a location get her eyes off of some denomination get her eyes off some some certain sex some certain religious belief some specific tradition that's been passed down from generation to generation and get her to focus on the one in whose pres she's in but those that worship God must worship and recognize him in his present form not just your outward action not just your forms and the gifts that you bring to God but Spirit allow the spirit to move don't quench the Holy Spirit when it comes by and it nudges you to to do something there's some of you that's missed the moving of the spirit because of your Humanity cuz maybe you're worried about what your neighbor going to think about it maybe you're worried about you know what they're going to say on the live stream we don't care what they say on any stream he desires worship when there feels to be a a tongue go forth we need to yield learn to yield to it that's worship unto God and an interpretation is a worship unto God or anything that God leads you to do the prophet of God said the spirit will not lead you to do anything that's wrong that's but he's pulling on you to worship Him and your worship will be different than your neighbor's worship Sister Jenny I love you but you and I worship completely different Say Amen amen we worship different now the only one closest to worship like me in here is probably my Rebecca she got a lot of Joe Adams in her but we're all different we're all unique right and we're going to get into a little bit more but worship is a denial of self yes where it ain't about you yes it's about laying yourself down your ideas down your Humanity down stepping aside from your nature well it ain't in me to do that yes it is God put it there God placed it there God put in every human being a desire for worship God created you for that purpose and that purpose alone maybe not alone but he created you to worship so that you can be he could be a loving father he can be a faithful high priest he can be a wonderful deliver he can be all that you have need of and you can worship him not with just pray praise and adoration but from a heart from your heart you know you find young people today they want to go to Every camp meeting there is and hey praise God for that but the heart's still not right why chase a camp if your heart ain't in it God is looking for people to worship him see worship must be done in spirit in a spiritual way not some legalistic View okay not some legalistic man-made idea it can only be this we got to listen to Southern gospel music oh my goodness you going to have a hard time in Africa with Southern gospel I've been to Africa they don't play southern gospel folks they have their own worship and let me tell you and it's pleasing unto the Lord it's completely different than our worship the music is got a holy a whole completely different being to it but yet God comes down God anoints it God shows up God drops down the Holy Spirit floods the place there's been the presence of the Angel of the Lord the pillar of fire in their services and you're telling me that it can only be done through southern gospel or through the reading of the the read him book and this book and that book God will be praised by somebody with a Heart of Worship and when you truly worship God the way he desire his presence will fill the place his presence will fill the place and God will come on The Scene It Ain't About location it ain't about our ideas it ain't about a certain music or a certain genre it's about worshiping him the King of Kings and the Lord of lords I even got babies screaming Hallelujah they know it's the truth speaking in tongues we got no interpreter for that this morning so don't try to put God in a box and say we got to do this this way and it's got to be this way and it's got to be this way God can do things that's not even written in the word that shows he's a bigger God than we are so why limit why limit God so there's a vast difference we're going to go on a little further a lot further we only got one service today that's right so we must Worship the Lord Jesus not by our physical appearance well I looked apart you know I don't wear skinny jeans brother Joe not wearing necklaces and not wearing bracelets and you know I look like a mess believer like a real Son of God to look you know I don't wear tight tops and split skirts I look like a mess sister should look but if it's not done with the heart it deviates from TRU worship cuz you're trying to place it on a formality and God don't want formality God wants a heart that's full of worship so there's a difference between praise and praising God we're going to go down this road and worship in worshiping God so the Bible tells us in Hebrews 13 and verse1 15 if you have your Bibles you can turn there or they can put it up on the screen by him therefore let us offer the sacrifices of praise to God continually the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name so praise is a thank offering see it's a sacrifice the sacrifice of praise is the fruit of your lips but worship is the fruit of your heart two different places worship is about love and appreciation praise is about an outward communication from actions praise is joyful recounting of all that God has done for you whether you realize it or not you can praise God but yet not be worshiping God but you can never worship God and not be praising him did you hear that you can be praising God but not be worshiping but if you ever found worshiping God you will be praising him you will be shouting The Joy Bells you will be in moved by the spirit of God however it leads you cannot worship God but what you can't praise him for what he's done for you the Bible says in Luke 6 verse 45 a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh so if inside of your heart is full of love inside of your heart is full of goodness inside of your heart is full of worship you can't help but the Praises of God begin to flow out but if it ain't there you'll just Praise on and praise on there'll be nothing really worshiping God so excuse me praise is closely intertwined with Thanksgiving as we offer back to God an appreciation and appreciation for his mighty works on our behalf praise can be given to another you can praise your pastor for faithfulness for all these years of being a Godly servant you can praise your parents for being good stewards and good parents you can praise the paper boy for dropping off your paper every day see you can praise your friends you can praise your boss but you see praise doesn't require anything of us see it's just a truthful acknowledgment of the righteous acts of another but worship belongs to God and God Alone we find that worship comes from a different place within our Spirits we look here in Luke 4 and verse 8 Jesus answered and he said unto him get thee behind me Satan for it is written that thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shall thou worship so worship only belongs to God see worship is the art and I want to capitalize on this this morning worship is is the art of losing oneself in the Adoration of another worship is the art of losing oneself in the Adoration of another how many have ever watched a football game baseball game some kind of game I know y'all trying to be cherubs this morning but hey we human and your team come from behind 20 points you didn't just sit there like this did you no what happened come on somebody brother help me out come on now man your team was behind 20 points man you lost yourself when they started coming back and they finally won the game and went on to the Conference Finals or went on to the championship you completely lost yourself there well if we can lose ourself in a ball game if we can lose oursel out there in the world why can't we lose oursel in the house of God why can't we lose ourselves into worshiping him he's the one that's worthy to be worshiped we got to have the act of losing ourself and putting God first and foremost well it's not my nature I'm so sick of hearing my nature the art of losing oneself lose your nature into an atmosphere of worship that's Hallelujah well brother tell I'm a I'm an introvert okay I am too 50/50 50% of the time I'm an introvert I people out quick I have to go on up to the upstairs then there's time I'm an extrovert I like to have a house full but it's the art of losing oneself into the Adoration of God and we come we so stuffed amen I've been look I I'm not trying to say this to be ugly but I've been coming to this church for 25 plus years I've still not seen some of you ever move and I don't mean that to be funny amen but what about worship God has sent us a Vindicated message and it should move you to recognize who you are that you can see your name on the Lamb's Book of Life like John saw his name John wasn't afraid in the presence of 24 Angels or 24 Elders to fall down and worship God he had big time men around him or big time people and yet he fell prostrate and begin to worship God because there was a lame that was slain that was worthy to be praised and John said I'm not going to let somebody else take my place I'm not going to let some tree clap in my place I'm not going to let some bird sing in my place I'm going to give God my worship and everything in heaven and everything in the earth and everything below there they heard I talk shouting and screaming and answer and worshiping my God because he has he alone is worthy and if God can do it what about the Bride of Jesus Christ John is a representation of that bride am I'm I'm not saying we got to get all emotional worked up but I'm trying to show you got to put your nature aside and give God what he desires and wake up and Worship the Lord hallelujah he deserves your worship he desires your worship see worship is saying not my will but yours be done oh well it's not my nature brother Joe just not made like you well but worship is not about you that's right it's not about your makeup it's not about your nature it's about him and what you are here is what you're going to be there come on somebody what you are here is what you're going to be there I'm not even going to ask some of you what you think you're going to be but let me tell you if I seen them streets I can't wait one day I will see it I'm not just going to walk brother Jonathan oh bless God I made it on the streets ago I'm going to be dancing like a fool on them streets cuz I made it I made it through Lea I made it through the muck of the world I made it through I made it I made it through this world that we living in I made it I'm going to worship God and what I am there I am here I'm a worshiper of the one to God I don't need streets are go now but one day what I'm doing here I'm going to do there I'm I'm going to dance my way I'm going to praise my way I'm going to worship him because he desires My Worship and I created for it and you're created for it this morning you're created for worship amen see worship worship gets to the heart of who we are praise can be a part of worship but worship goes beyond praise praise is easy all of y'all came in many of y'all sang when brother Mike was leading Us in worship this morning but to worship all together different some of you your mouth ain't open yet I'm not not trying to be ugly cuz worship comes from a different place worship is a sacrifice yes anybody can sing while everybody's singing but what about those certain times when you don't feel like it you had a bad day you and the MS don't look at me brother H you and the misses done got in a squabble and them kids and done got all turned out man they make you want to just put them off on side the road that stop sign we all been there parents say Amen oh yeah some of y'all truthful some of y'all got a lying Spirit on you but no you come you can praise God oh yeah but when the word's going for we just we nod God ain't looking for nodders I'm not trying to beat you up make you emotional I'm just trying to get you to be worshippers because worship is the denial of self deny how you feel deny what you think you know sometimes you got to deny to even shut your mouth cuz some of us just want to open up Let It All fly out but true worship is knowing when to shut up want to just be quiet when just sit back and watch God let God do his thing I believe God can do more in a church service than what we can try to do by putting our own little filtrations on it and this one on it move this one do this one all this let God do it but when we're here Church we're going to spend two or three hours on on a Sunday in the house of God we're going to spend two hours on a Wednesday night why can't we come with a heart that's so glad if you look out there and you look at the world you look at the conditions that's laying around we got this homosexual agenda and this agenda and this world generation and people by God they don't even know who they are today and yet you got your sound mind God's put a desire in your heart to worship Him can't we just break away from our society for a few hours and give God what he deserves amen give God what he wants from you he created you for that purpose see worship gets to the heart of who we are worship requires you to deny yourself deny how you feel deny what you think see to truly worship God you have to let go of self worship so you got to let go of your pride well brother Joe now you got to let go of your pride got to let go of your arrogance news flash can I give you CNN just be in it ain't about you it ain't about you I know that's shocking but it's not about us it's about him see let go of what others may say about you I like what brother Timothy brought out let go Faith to let go to let go and do what when Peter stepped out on that Bo that was a step of Faith cuz he inside of him he wanted to worship Jesus Christ and so we must be willing to Humble ourselves before God surrender every part of our Lives to his control and adore him for who he is not just what he does for us see worship is a lifestyle back when I was 17 18 19 I was 2 20 lb 5 foot nothing I was a rly poly yeah I'm glad y'all didn't know me back then but when I was in my freshman year in college I lost 70 pounds in three months he said brother why you telling us telling us this because I made a lifestyle change brother Jackson I don't eat the same things I used to eat or maybe I do but I don't eat as much because I made a change I made a conscious effort to keep my weight off and so worship is a lifestyle it's not just some fad that we go through at some camp meeting or some special services when everybody's there and your favorite friends are there and your favorite preachers there and all a sudden you can get behind that no but worship is no matter if you're on the Mountaintop you can worship God whether you're in the valley you can worship God whether you're facing a fiery furnace you can worship God and say we not Bend we not bow we not break down we not give into this worldly condition oh but our God is able our God is able and we're going to worship that God we're not worried about you Nebuchadnezzar we're going to worship the one true Living God whether you're facing a de allance it doesn't matter oh King I'm going to see you in the morning I'm going to see you on the other side I'm going to worship my way through this Valley whether you're whether you're blind like barus you can scream out thou son of David have mercy on me or maybe you're like the Rich Young Ruler or maybe Lazarus and you ain't got a penny to your name but you know that God supplies all all my needs according to his riches and Glory see that's worship when you can thank God in the bad times you can praise God on the good times but worship comes from the heart and God is seeking those he says in John 4:24 the hour cometh and now is now is this is the day this is the age where the bride of Christ will worship him for who he is that's right and that's what the father seeks so true worship is focused only on the father not on self not on specific doctrines or dogmas denominations it's only f focus on the father and notice it's not just having the mechanics of it well we got the word we got the word we got the word we got the word praise God you got the word but you ain't got no life in it and it's more than just having all the spirit all the shout and you're running around like a bunch of heathens running around just circle circle circle and you got nothing you're running without a message but spirit worship true worship is done with mechanics and Dynamics amen listen what the prophet says he he said mechanics don't run the church it's the Dynamics the holy ghost that gets into this word it's not Seminary that teaches you all the Theology and Greek interpretations but it's the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost in there to set that a fire and to bring it to pass and to make it live just exactly what was promised the word is for this hour not not the the Dynamics it takes the mechanics and the Dynamics the word and the spirit they are the ones that give life am but it's done by a personal revelation so true worship can I go on yes I can thank you so much First Kings 17 and verse 8 true worship is a denial of self and it's giving God what he desires right first First Kings 17:8 and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise and get thee to zarap which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he arose and he went to zapat and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there Gathering of sticks and he called to her and he said fetch me I pray thee a little morsel or a little water in a vessel that I may drink and she was going to fetch it and he called to her and said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thy hand and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I'm gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat and die and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me thereof a little cake first how dare you ask me when I have nothing how dare you ask me to worship God when I had a horrible day yesterday when my morning has been miserable you just don't understand what I've been going through make me a cake first seek ye first the kingdom of God and all his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you notice she had the me which represents Christ the word and she had just a little bit of oil represents the spirit so she had the Dynamics with the mechanics and she says I'm gathering two sticks so I can create a fire and I can mix these two things together and make a cake that me and my son are going to eat and we're going to die see Spirit Worship is not leaving them separate no but it's bringing the two together and mixing it placing it on the fire of the word of God God and letting letting the Holy Spirit Come and energize your worship and we find here brother B says many people worship in spirit but not in truth and many in truth but not in spirit but when you get the two of them together then you got something when the spirit gets into the word she mix it together and when you get the spirit of God on you mix with God's word something's going to happen and she started to go and she heard a voice say in your hand fetch me a little morsel of bread and she turned No Doubt with tears in her eyes she says sir that's what I'm out here in the yard Gathering these two sticks for I just got a handful of meal and a spoonful of oil I mixed it together and dressed it that I got these two sticks to make a fire and bake a cake for me and my son and we're going to eat and we're going to die she looked at him and he said but first make me a cake and sometimes that's the way it is on a Sunday morning or a Monday or a Tuesday or a Wednesday some of you got children that are out there in the world but make me a cake purse make me a worship purse give me what I desire first I'll take care care of the wer I'll take care of the prodicle I'll take care of the sickness I'll take care of the doctor's report I'll take care of this sick I'll take care of all of that just make me a cake first offer me worship first he said put God first put God put his word first put his Spirit first put him first bring me a little cake first oh she runs in there and she said the spirit he said the spirit called back thus sayith the Lord he said the mill Barrel will not go empty nor the crws ever run dry and why is that church cuz when you reach the bottom of your Barrel when you reach the bottom of your Humanity when you reach the bottom of your ability you reach the top of God and if you give God what he desire he'll feel that Barrel he'll feel that Cru he'll give you what you have NE he'll not be done but you must deny yourself hey give God what he desires first God don't want second place he'll take it but he wants first he wants to be first place in your marriage he wants to be first place on the job he wants to be first place in school he wants first [Music] place see worship is not a conception of God man's idea of who he is or denominational aspect of what they claim God to be but now the end time believer can worship God the way he desires to be worshiped because a father once again has poured out his spirit and he's tied all the loose sins together and now on the scene is a bride that's willing to say come and see come and see a man who's told me all that I've done that woman go back to the woman at the well there we find the she said but Jesus is telling her but the hour comth now is when the spirit when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him He said God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and in truth and in verse 29 she said come and see a man which told me all the things that I did is not this to Christ notice she wasn't afraid to tell her testimony she was afraid to tell about the prophet of Galilee that met her at the well and she took her eyes off her Jeffersonville she took her eyes off a Nashville she took her eyes off a or shet port and she put her eyes on Jesus why because her heart had been turned her heart had been changed and God turned her heart from unbelief to believe it and when your heart is turned from unbelief to believe it you can worship God today when you realize who you are and what God has made you to be you may have had a dirty life like the woman at the well but but God ain't looking at the fifth man the sixth man God is looking at himself just give me worship and I'll change your life offer unto me what I desire and I'll rewrite your story it's not over she ran into the city dropped her water pot come see a man telling everybody about that was a Heart of Worship she wasn't worried about the mountain she wasn't worried about Jerusalem as a city she was only there to worship the one that she just came out of his presence and the father is seeking those that'll worship him the same Romans 12 and verse1 this says Paul kind of reframes this idea of sacrifice as a form of worship Paul we find in Romans 12 and verse1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and that word service is worship you look it up in the Greek it is worship that's your reasonable worship that you offer this body you offer this body your ideas and you lay it on God's altar because it ain't About Us listen what he says here see our minds need a complete renovation not only does our hearts need to be turned but our minds cuz today you know the world today that you're entitled you're entitled to this you're entitled to that everybody gets a participation trophy when I played Little League ball we didn't get look I was fat and dumpy I didn't get no trophy well short fat man don't or for short fat kid you don't get trophies unless you really good but today we give everybody a trophy you get a trophy from coming to church little gold star we're going to put it on the board today you showed up for service no but Paul is telling us it's not about who we are what we're entitled to It Ain't About Us it ain't about the woke generation it ain't about offending this one or that one or this agenda versus that agenda God ain't worried about agendas he's got one desire and that's to be worshiped but we find that Satan's created a world of self-indulgence self-pleasure self- worship but God is looking for those that will sacrifice those that will present themselves as a Living Sacrifice and do like Paul Die daily lay yourself on his Altar and say not my will but thy will be done where your minds have been renewed no longer is it about us no longer are we thinking like the world thinks no longer as our hearts are the way they used to be they've been changed and we're not looking for personal gain or personal attention but we lay ourselves on an altar as a service of worship you know that the first time the word worship was was ever mentioned in the Bible was mentioned with Abraham and Isaac obviously you didn't know that Genesis 22 it says and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt or test Abraham and he said unto him Abraham and he said behold here am I and he said take now thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Mariah and offer him for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I was tell thee and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took his two young men with him and Isaac his son and he caved the wood for the burn offering and Rose up and he went into the place which God had told him and on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off and Abraham said unto the young men abide ye here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again into you notice Abraham waited 25 years for This Promise of Isaac to be manifested and now he's being asked to sacrifice we just assume the kids 14 15 years old he's being asked to sacrifice but see God was getting to the Heart of Worship some of us might say you know what no God I done waited a long time for this one you I ain't putting him nowhere I'm not taking him you going to have to drag me Kicking and Screaming but notice how dare you ask me to to sacrifice my son when I waited so long and I've only had this few years with him I'm not going to do it I'm entitled to the promise but that ain't how Abraham responded to the word to the request to go worship because Abraham was created for worship Abraham knew to trust God and he knew that if God can give him to me as one from the dead then God can bring him back to me from the de if I lay him on the altar of sacrifice and I'm going to tell you my brother and sister God is still the same God today and Abraham's response was that immediately he saddled an ass he was willing to do what the father requested him to do and I wonder about us notice God gave him the promise and he received him as one from the dead and God's able to raise him up from the dead he rose early in the morning made the preparations though he didn't understand it though he couldn't reason it all out he was a worshipper and it was a part of his worship and sometimes God's going to ask you to do some very difficult things that don't make sense that you can't reason out but it's a part of worship God is testing you to see if you truly love him to see if you truly will be obedient to him see worship is not about about you it's a denial of self you don't think Abraham had bad days oh we see the bright side don't we he staggered not praise God Abraham had some gloomy days how many of you've never had a bad day never had a bad day good Lord did y'all not hear every hand went up we got some angels in the house of God but you never had a bad day we all have had bad days yes oh that was weak I said we all have had bad days that's better me and brother L he's with me Abraham had some bad days he was asked to believe five years went by as anything changed nothing changed but bless God anyway God's able 10 years go by he's still holding on to the promise 15 years 20 years 25 years he waited and he held on to the promise and the Bible said Being not weak in faith he considered not the his own body Dead when he was about a 100 years old neither the deadness of Sarah's W and he staggered not at the promises of God he didn't waver from the promise he didn't waver from the belief that God's able to do it and there's the bride in the name in the land today she's not going to stagger and waver and get away from the promise of God that God promised a Rapture for the church and there's going to be a Rapture for the church and until the until that Rapture takes place she's going to worship God until the door opens up she's going to praise God in the hallway say let's worship Him Today Church let's not wait for your favorite preacher or the special meeting God deserves worship today and he desires it today see Abraham believed when his eyes didn't show him Abraham believed though it was yet manifested it was not yet manifested though he fully couldn't understand it how is God going to do this I'm an old man and my wife look at her she's old she's wrinkled the paps are dry there's no possible way but he believed and now he's being asked now he's being asked to offer up this miracle offer him up and and the Bible says he staggered not at the promises of God I don't think that was just for the 25 years I think God they wrote about it because they saw him willingly take their his son lay him on the altar pull back his hand with a knife and the angel of the Lord said Abraham stay thy hand now I know that thou lovest me now I know that you worship me and there was a lamb caught in a Thicket and Abraham took that lamb or that Ram laid him on the Altar and slain a lamb in Isaac's place and he named that place Jehovah J and I'm here to tell you he's still Jehovah jarra for you today he's still able to meet your needs this this morning but see Abraham stagger not at the promises of God and it's not about how we feel not about the circumstances you know he had all the odds against him but God's for him deadness of his body deadness of Sarah's womb Sarah's unbelief was working against him today you may have a doctor's report working against you you may have all kind of things working against you but I'm asking you today will you lay it on the altar will you lay yourself on the altar maybe God's asking you today to to lay that relationship on the altar maybe that friendship with that boy or that girl lay it on the Altar and see what God can do about it maybe God's asking you to put that job on the altar keeping you out of church put that on the altar whatever it is maybe that video game that consumes all your time or maybe that social media platform that creates a lot of drama in your life you're so concerned about how many likes you get why do you care when he says I made you accepted and the Beloved that's the only like that matters that's the only like that matters is I'm accepted amen I heard brother Brown just the other day I think it was in the meatest man in the city he says you know I wasn't there that day when he said some of those famous words but he goes I I want to be there when he says well done I want to hear those words well done my good and faithful servant you worshiped me you served me the way I desired to be worshiped can we move on so Abraham was fully persuaded I'm gonna try to close this out here in about the next 15 20 minutes everybody good you laugh HL says he was fully persuaded so if we can be fully persuaded that means we can also be partially persuaded so what does it mean brother Joe to be partially persuaded persuaded it means that you know partially persuaded believers they live in Two Worlds they live in a world of self-effort self-help fear and doubt and they live in a world of faith and if Faith ain't working they go to plan B they try to help God out amen come on somebody we have all been partial Believers partially persuaded at times we tried to help God out some of you were up to 12:30 1:00 this morning trying to figure it all out oh yeah we try to help God do Godly things you ain't meant to do Godly things God is meant to do Godly things but the so we find that a partial persuaded believer you know they they don't lean on faith the way we lean on faith but faith is is a backup plan there's always a backup to it if if it don't happen then I'm going to help out God I'm going to do this but until we fully realize that God is our complete source of strength he's our complete source of provision he's our complete source of power and understanding and be fully persuaded in church it's no use but I'm here to tell you that being fully persuaded is a decision and worshiping God this morning is a decision that each of us must make it's a decision that you deny yourself what others think about you you know that's a lot of us we think we're just so concerned about what everybody else thinks don't we some of us could care less I wish I had that attitude sometimes like I ain't worried about you dummy but some of us ain't nature that way you say something it's taken the wrong way man it eats to you or somebody thinks this about you and it gets back to you you get your feelings all hurt I just ain't going to come back to the house of God what did God do to you I ain't coming back I ain't coming back God didn't do that to you no we take it out on God all he wants you to do is worship when we get our feelings hurt we get sideways we get this we get that we're human folks but see no matter what no matter what your neighbor thinks about you no matter what those on the live stream are going to stream in they may see some of you shout and some of you jump and some of you cry some of you we just going to act different and they may get critical but true worship looks past the critics see true worship doesn't worry about the critics Abraham made a decision to offer his son he wasn't worried about what anybody else thought about it he had a relationship with God and it didn't it didn't make sense to his human understanding and it sometimes it won't make sense to ours you'd be looking like why are they jumping and shouting and dancing and running I don't feel that well maybe you wasn't in their trial maybe if you was in their trial and you got their Victory you would act the way they're acting or maybe let's just say this maybe if you could recognize that you're in a trial and that he deserves your worship and you can set your personal attitude aside and your personal views aside and give him what he desires maybe there'll be an emotion rise up within you and you'll do things you've never done before because remember worship is surrendering all to him I told a young young man last week I said lose yourself in him he sent me five or six voice messages this morning lose yourself in him he says I didn't know what you meant he goes but last week I watched the Dallas Mavericks play the Denver Nuggets and they were down 20 points and Dallas is my favorite team and they're down 20 points and they had the biggest comeback in NBA history and he goes I got beside myself brother Joe and it goes I understood what you meant to Lose Yourself see he lost himself as a fan because his team came back from 20 points to win the Conference Final we got more on the line than a conference Championship we got a Rapture on the line we got Souls on the line we got sons and daughters on the line we got prodal on the line we got others that need healing in their body it's on the line and all I'm asking you this morning is Lose Yourself sir in an attitude of worship look past the critic and give God let go and give God what he desires we're going to bring this down I bring it down here before we do though the Bible would tell us in Matthew 15 and verse 8 this people they draw nigh unto me with their mouth and they honor me with their lips but their heart is far away see but in vain that word vain there is fruitlessly they do worship me teaching for the doctrines and the Commandments of men see they made great profession they pretend with much devotion and piety but their heart is far from me they do not seriously or sincerely love me nor obey me they don't give me their heart oh they can sing songs they can go through the motions but God is looking at the heart he wants this and he knows church he knows when you come in the house of God and you just give lip service and he knows when you come in the house of God and You Give a Heart of Worship and that's what I want today is for us to go back and say God I want to give you a Heart of Worship see in vain they worship me they they idly unprofitably you know Stand By and they just worship their worship does not attain to the end which Divine worship was appointed neither does it please God nor prophit themselves for it might be in the spirit but if it's not in truth it's still not worship and if it's in truth and not in spirit then it's still not worship it has to be in both and he says Jesus said un said when he was on Earth he said he said said in vain do they worship me now there is then a possibility it is so that there can be genuine worship of God wrong in vain do they worship me teaching for the doctrine and the Commandments of man notice having a formality but not losing theirselves in an atmosphere of worship putting everybody aside today he goes I know we got great songs we build great churches we got great anthems everything we praise him like that but Jesus says in your heart you're far from me for you teach for the doctrine and the Commandments of Men Let the Holy Spirit come in and do something in the church showing the presence of Jesus Christ they'll kick you out the door so we don't want our worship to be in vain this morning we don't want it to be fruitless and void we don't want our worship to be merely man-made traditions and ideas that's been passed down from generation to generation but we find today in many churches you can't be free to worship God that we have to sit and we have to nod and we have to be quiet we have to be respectful and reverent he said in vain do they worship me brother B says I've seen jumping spells Joy spells but there was nobody hurt or you trying now you trying to make make it all emotion not at all he says the mountains rung out the sun went down everybody took place everything took place but there was nobody hurt I've seen meetings where the power of God was revealed to the people they were free from the world the things of the world the joy of the Lord filled the congregation they stood and screamed and cried and shouted to the top of their voice for the glory of God I never did see anything disorderly they was always right in order because they had recognized that their name and been written on the Lamb's Book of Life and I say this if your worship lines up with this quote then you're in order this morning if your worship marries up to this quote it may be singing it may be shouting it may be dancing where the presence of God Falls it doesn't matter don't let some cold formal devil come and tell you you got to sit there and sit by and be idle and quiet and you can't worship God some Luke War foral Spirit wants to tell tell us today that we can't worship we got to be dignified and we got to revealed word today and we know we don't need none of that nonsense let me tell you it may be nonsense to them but it ain't nonsense to us it's worship to us we find notice everywhere Jesus went there was a little bit of quietness everybody was sleeping church was like a mouse you can hear him moving squeaking no the Bible says everywhere that Jesus went there was noise notice the shout of the king was in the camp that word shout there means Jubilee it means a loud noise of rejoicing you telling me we got the king in the camp and we can't shout about it oh my goodness we might as well go back to the bar we might as well go back to the party scene that sounds absurd doesn't it it sounds ridiculous doesn't it yeah and that's just as about as ridiculous is having the king in our midst and not being able to shout let me tell you the rocks will crowd in your place if you won't praise him if you won't worship him I don't want no Rock crying in my place God gave me hands of worship God gave me feet to worship God gave me breath in my love to worship God gave me a mou to praise him and he's worthy to be worshiped I'm not going to let somebody tell me to sit back sit idle and sit out and don't worship God God deserves worship and I've been created for such I worship God in the good time I'll worship God in the bad time I'll worship God in the dark time I will worship God cuz he is worthy to be worshiped he is worthy to be praised we got the king in the Camp Jubilee that's right and where the spirit where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty not bondage you're free even light you're free bride to worship him and it's more than just lip service notice if there ever was a people in the land today that should be able to shout because the king is in a camp there ever was a people that should be able to Rejoice because the king is among them there ever was a people that should be able to dance because they got Victory it should be this bride I will have a church without a spot without a wrinkle without a blemish yes A Perfect Bride brother the hell we didn't make ourselves perfect but the word has made us what we are hallu and if there should be anybody that can worship God it should be his bride brother Brown would tell us this and they speak to the mountains as I move quickly on he said there was a colored sister and we wouldn't use that word today cuz it's not fitting but he said there's a color such a man she could sing and bring the presence of God in he goes all day all night the angels watching over me he goes oh he goes I always just almost had to tie my hand hands and keep from R from ruining the meeting jumping up and down screaming and running all over the place if that was good enough for a prophet it's good enough for me and if it was good enough for your Prophet it should be good enough for you well it ain't my nature well you may need to see where your name's at that your name's in the Lamb's Book of Life and all day and all night the angels of God are watching over me in the good time they're watching over me in my bad time the angel are watching over me I tell I got to tie my hand Oh Tie My Feet why because why he deserves our worship what he's done for you brother and sister think about the massless grace of God he says you can be emotional right if you got the right kind of emotion with it or behind it the right kind of emotion moving your emotion that's right so it ain't all emotion but it's okay to have it if you you got the right kind of emotion see if you got the right kind of emotion behind the spirit behind it the truth behind it so worship you have to look past your critics we're going to turn this is our last scripture reading for today 2 Samuel 6 and verse 11 the Ark of the Lord continued in the house of OED Edom the get tip for three months and the Lord blessed OED Edom and all of his household and it was told King David saying the Lord had blessed the house at OED Edom and all that pertaineth unto him because the Ark of God so David went and brought up the Ark of God from the house at OED Edom in the city of David with gladness so three three months prior to this David tried to do God a service without it being revealed to him he thought this was customary this is what I should do as the king and yet it wasn't in God's plan God's time and he tried to do something and it cost a man usza his life but three months had passed and David feared God and David got his heart right and David wanted to be right with God and so he waited and we find here that now God gave the green light if we would say to go and bring the ark back amen now now it's time and David says and so it was so that when he bued the Ark of the Lord had gone six Paces he sacrificed an oxin and fatlings and David danced before the Lord with all his might and David guarded with the linen ephod so David and all the house of Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of a trumpet notice David danced before the Lord why because the word was being restored the word was coming back to its proper position and here it is he was the greatest King that there ever was and yet the king set aside his prize the king set aside his kingdom ship the king satisfi set aside his Royal Roop and he got out there with the people and he begin to dance and worship why because the word was being restored and you're telling me today we got the Vindicated word being restored to a people back in the proper position and we got to sit back and be quiet we got a right to worship the word has come back to a bride the word has been restored the spirit has been poured out we got a right to dance to shout to rejoice hallah David wasn't worried about his image he wasn't worried about his image brother B says when he saw the word as it was with tables of stone back he said it brought back to his place David rejoiced and danced in the spirit around and around and around he saw the word back in its place he said that's what the word needs not some s some theological mixup but an oldfashioned godsent preacher behind the pulpit with the word seeing God Vindicated its proof but you know David danced before the Lord and in every church service there's going to be a Critic I can't believe look at him call himself a king call himself a preacher I'm doing exactly what an evangelist does that's right I evangelize yes I get excited I get excited I'm not a teacher yes and I'm not throwing off on teachers so I better be to move on but here David was he's worshiping he done put his Royal apparel aside and put on the Lin and Epi he was just like everybody else he didn't care about his position in the church he didn't care if he did the music if he ran this or ran that or ran the other it didn't matter to him he got right out there among them brother stripped his Royal apparel said I'm one of you and the word is being restored the word is being restored oh they probed at it for many years they tried to bring it for many years through six Church ages and it's not been restored yet but in the seventh Church age it was time yes and now it's time there there's a David in the land today that'll worship God because the word's been restored but you find David had to look past the critic because his old wife looked out the window yeah his wife the one that should know his heart the one that should be tender and merciful to him and you know just kind of Love David but we find in 2 Samuel 6:16 as the Ark of the Lord came into the city Michael Saw's daughter looked through the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord and she despised him with her heart that word despised means she disdained him that means she she considered him worthless and she regarded him with contempt she may have disdained David and considered him worthless a worthless husband an unfit King but oh God said you're a man after my own heart in this world may consider you worthless they may consider you unfit but God Almighty is said that's my bride she'll be one that worship me when the world won't worship me when the BST won't worship me when the Pentecost won't worship me but she will she'll worship me she'll look past the critic she'll look past the fan and she will give me what I desire she will worship [Applause] me I like what brother Brandon would say about it but let's go into it real quick 2 Samuel 6 verse 20 David returned to bless his and notice now he's done bless all the people if you go a few verses up but you don't have to go there he blessed every man woman gave him flesh and piece of Flesh and flag and of wine so all the people departed they went them to his house and returned to bless his own house it be like me going home today preaching my heart out and my wife you took your jacket off you look like an idiot up there Jumping All Around shouting and screaming spitting everywhere notice Michael the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said how glorious you can just imagine a little snar little snotty little woman how glorious was the king of Israel today who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids and his servants is one of the vain fellows Shamel uncovered himself how dare you you embarrass me up here preaching like that dancing like that shouting like that don't you know we didn't do that back at my father's house I like David's reply David said to Michael it was before the Lord I said it was before the Lord he wasn't worried about the critic it was before the Lord and if your worship is unto the Lord don't worry about your critic it was before the Lord notice see it was before the Lord which chose me before thy father and before all his house to appoint me to be the ruler over the people of the Lord over Israel therefore will I play before the Lord and I will be yet more vow than thus if you didn't like that watch this that's what your Prophet said he said he looked at Michael he said Michael if you didn't like that worship let me tell you you don't want to criticize on the live stream if you didn't like that worship and watch this there is a PR in the end time and she's been created to worship God musicians when you come there on the inside of her is a desire she ain't worried about the critic she she ain't worried about her idea she ain't worried about Mak what everybody happen but she had a desire to worship God and dancing is a part of that worship and shouting is a part of that worship and raising your hands and rejoicing is a part of that worship and crying and tears streaming down it's a part of that worship some of you May Cry tears streaming down your eyes but it's not your natural nature but it comes from your heart that's worship yes some of you introverts you may jump out of that shell for a brief moment and begin to shout and dance but see it's not your nature therefore it's worship and some of you extroverts you may raise your hands and just say God thank you for all that youve done see worship is not about us it goes completely Beyond who we are yes yes it goes completely beyond what we think beyond what we think who we are and it's all about him can we get back to the Heart of Worship where it's not on a Doctrine brother said I'd rather be right in my spirit and wrong in my Doctrine than to be right in my Doctrine WR wrong in my spirit cuz see from the heart your spirit will cry out to God now you can be arrogant in your heart in your spirit you can be prideful you can be critical but if you can set all that aside and say today I just want to worship him he deserves My Worship look past my failures my shortcomings I just want to worship Him CU inside of you God created you for worship God created you nobody can worship him like this bride because you're created in His image created for a purpose to be a son and daughter of God and only a true son and a true daughter can love the father way he desires to be loved what about a church look pastor critics deny yourself that's worship anybody can sing okay maybe not anybody can make a Joyful Noise but everybody that's called by his name that recognizes he's Papa he's father and I'm his son and I'm his daughter they have the right to worship you can worship past your feelings you can worship past what you see see you can worship past what you think and you can offer God a sacrifice what about it today church only you can worship God the way he desires Angels can't take your place brother Creed but you got a place that they just sit back and watch my look at him worship my look at those young people in Leo deia worshiping me not just in vain not just with lip service but from a heart young girls young boys nine 10 years old give their heart to God receive the baptism all the Holy Ghost give her life as a form of worship see David worshiped with all this heart and I wonder today if we can get back to a Heart of Worship where it's not about us but it's about him he took our place he took our Stripes he took our sin he filled us with the Holy Spirit can't we shout if that's where he leads us to can't we Rejoice if that's what he's asking of you to doen so I'm not asking you to jump and run the ows this morning because we're going to worship different your worship will not be My Worship and My Worship will not be your worship but all of our worship must be unto him look past your complexes this morning suicide said I'll take you down depression said I'll take you down fear said I'll take you down all these things family strains you know they come and they try to haunt us and linger over us and try to tell you you're not good enough and all that but he deserves worship and I believe they there's if there ever was a people on the place on the planet there is a people right now today that this is the hour that that the father seeketh those that will worship Him in spirit and in truth can we worship this morning amen let's just Worship the Lord let's just stand to her feet this morning and just worship when the service is over let's offer God let it not be just from your lips this morning anybody can do that but let us be from your heart Lord I give you my heart you've seen where
