[33:59] truth thank you Father for this time in
[34:01] Jesus name
[34:04] amen amen turn to the book of Acts if
[34:08] you would Acts chapter
[34:10] 24
[34:12] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[34:15] Lord amen good to be with God's
[34:19] people
[34:23] amen amen
[34:28] Acts chapter 24 and verse uh
[34:31] 14 said but this I confess unto thee
[34:35] that after the way which they call
[34:37] heresy so worship I the god of my
[34:40] fathers believe in all things which are
[34:43] written in the law and in the prophet
[34:47] and having hope toward God which they
[34:49] themselves also allow that there shall
[34:51] be a resurrection of the Dead both of
[34:55] the just and the unjust amen we'll let
[34:58] you be
[35:00] seated i' kind of had this thought for
[35:04] for some time just pondering on it
[35:07] thinking about it but i' like to speak
[35:09] to you on the way which they faith in
[35:12] the way that they call
[35:14] heresy I think there a very much a key
[35:18] in this scripture that they call heresy
[35:21] amen heresy is an opinion that's
[35:24] profoundly at odds with what is
[35:27] generally
[35:28] accepted uh it's an inheritance
[35:30] inherence inherence to a religious
[35:33] opinion contrary to church Dogma it's a
[35:37] a descent or de deviation from a
[35:41] dominant Theory or opinion or
[35:44] practice uh you know sometimes we we
[35:47] think because the majority accepts
[35:50] something then that's just the way it
[35:51] should be or that's what's true but you
[35:55] know when you go against that what
[35:56] majority thinks
[35:58] then you become labeled amen and you
[36:00] become uh you're given a name honestly
[36:04] it's not necessarily a good thing always
[36:06] to go with the majority because we know
[36:09] as we can look in the Bible uh there are
[36:11] plenty of examples God's number was
[36:14] hardly ever the uh uh the majority it
[36:17] was always the minority uh there was
[36:20] Abraham and Sarah that was called out
[36:22] there was there was Noah and his
[36:24] children that was saved in the flood it
[36:26] was a very small number but compared to
[36:29] what was there upon the Earth and you
[36:31] know as we heard you know that wonderful
[36:32] message brother Michael Ray spoke about
[36:35] the words and they say you know because
[36:38] they say it does not mean it's right or
[36:41] true amen just because somebody says it
[36:44] does not mean that that's true but you
[36:46] know the devil from the beginning has
[36:48] tried to make the people of God Amen to
[36:51] uh to look like The Crazy Ones you know
[36:53] it's amazing in this hour that people
[36:55] who live a Christian Life who have
[36:57] Christian values who who hold to certain
[37:00] standards in their life they're actually
[37:02] we're actually looked at the people that
[37:04] are crazy to this world and and people
[37:06] that can paint their hair blue or put
[37:08] all kind of metal in their ears and
[37:11] their face they're the normal ones
[37:13] that's that's qu that's kind of insane
[37:14] if you ask me but you know the devil has
[37:17] always put that kind of thing upon the
[37:19] people of God he attached it to our
[37:21] Savior when he came upon the Earth he
[37:23] tried to label him as be elub or or or
[37:27] to try to throw smut on his birth and
[37:29] call him an illegitimate child you know
[37:32] he always has done that and he always
[37:35] will so the devil is constantly trying
[37:37] to clamp down upon us by calling us
[37:40] different things and different names you
[37:42] know calling us holy rollers or Fanatics
[37:44] or whatever amen you know brother B
[37:46] would say it like this he said I've
[37:48] never seen a Holy Roller yet he said
[37:51] that's a dirty name that the devil put
[37:53] on the church there's no such a thing as
[37:56] a Holy Roller no such a thing is an
[37:58] organization that that's called Holy
[38:00] Rollers they call anybody but they call
[38:02] anybody that believes in Holiness holy
[38:05] rollers and with but without Holiness no
[38:08] man shall see God so you see where the E
[38:11] essence of it comes from in other words
[38:13] it's something that the devil tries to
[38:15] put a tag upon the Church of God because
[38:18] you dress a certain way you act a
[38:20] certain way or you live a certain way
[38:22] amen but that that doesn't mean that
[38:24] it's so just because somebody said it he
[38:26] said but I I've sell the seven se's I
[38:29] I've never seen a Holy Roller yet that's
[38:30] just a dirty name that the devil tacked
[38:33] on this Holiness Church that's all no
[38:36] such a thing as a Holy Roller
[38:38] 969 different denominations in
[38:40] Washington DC recorded now now it's
[38:42] somewhere in the 40,000 denominations
[38:45] they call it you know it's just a slang
[38:47] name but like they did to Paul the way
[38:50] that they call heresy the that's the way
[38:53] I worship the Lord the way that they
[38:56] call crazy the way that they call crazy
[38:59] out there all that bunch of people
[39:01] that's screaming and hollering and
[39:03] carrying on the way is that that is the
[39:05] way that I worship the Lord is what he
[39:07] told the king Agrippa he said that's
[39:10] right that's the way I worship God and
[39:12] the way that they call crazy the way
[39:15] that they call heresy now he said well I
[39:17] would like to shake his hand this
[39:19] morning and say Amen brother Paul I'm
[39:22] standing with you amen almost 2,000
[39:26] years has passed but we still have that
[39:29] heresy
[39:31] going come on did
[39:33] y'all 2,000 years have passed but we
[39:37] still have that name going we're proudly
[39:40] still worshiping in the way that's
[39:43] called heresy in the way that people
[39:45] call crazy and lunatics and you done
[39:48] lost your mind it it's quite a flip in
[39:50] the world that we live that somebody
[39:52] that just wants to live a certain way
[39:54] and dress a certain way and act a
[39:56] certain way amen by what the Bible says
[39:59] is called crazy amen but you I'm I'm
[40:02] proud to put my shoulder with Paul and
[40:04] say I worship in the same way because as
[40:07] he said I believe all things that are
[40:09] written in the law and the prophets all
[40:12] that's in the Bible I believe it no
[40:14] matter how it makes me feel may it maybe
[40:16] it tears the hide off of Me Maybe it
[40:18] lifts me up but if it's in the Bible I
[40:21] believe what the Bible says amen and so
[40:24] amen there was a there was a girl
[40:26] brother brandom talked about talked to
[40:27] in Oregon one time and and she said you
[40:30] know your party over there there a bunch
[40:32] of strange kind of people and you know
[40:35] you know they're the ones that's going
[40:36] to be in heaven I wouldn't want to be
[40:38] there and I said well you don't have to
[40:40] worry much unless you change your
[40:42] attitude amen you don't have to worry
[40:44] very much about that she said but all
[40:45] that screaming and carrying on I said
[40:48] now wait a minute you worship Mary so
[40:50] I'm I'm assuming she must have been a
[40:51] Catholic you worship Mary and the Virgin
[40:54] Mary before God could ever put the
[40:56] wedding garment on her she had to go up
[40:59] to the day of Pentecost and get so full
[41:02] of the spirit of God till she staggered
[41:05] like she was drunk and you are not
[41:07] coming in any way less just remember
[41:10] that yes sir that's what you call the
[41:12] mother of God if if the Virgin Mary had
[41:14] to go to Pentecost or what you call
[41:17] heresy or Heretics and get the Holy
[41:20] Ghost before she could ever go to heaven
[41:22] you'll not get in on anything less just
[41:25] remember that she said oh that isn't so
[41:27] I said do you not believe the Bible here
[41:29] it is Mary was right with them in the
[41:31] upper room she got so full of the spirit
[41:34] until she danc on the spirit she acted
[41:37] like somebody was drunk you think you'll
[41:39] get to heaven on anything less you'll
[41:41] never do
[41:42] it you'll never do it so why so that
[41:45] makes me understand why the devil would
[41:48] want to put a smudy name upon that
[41:51] experience Amen on that experience of
[41:54] receiving the Holy Ghost he wants to
[41:55] call it fanaticism he wants want to call
[41:57] it emotion he wants to call it every
[41:59] kind of name why cuz he knows that's
[42:01] your ticket to Heaven amen not a dance
[42:04] not a shout but to have an experience
[42:06] with the Holy Ghost and when you have
[42:08] that experience you might shout you
[42:11] might dance you might speak in tongues
[42:13] you might stand there and cry you might
[42:15] not be able to do nothing but throw up
[42:17] your hands but you'll know from that
[42:19] moment you have been changed that
[42:21] something is coming to your life and
[42:23] you're never the same
[42:25] again but here's is you know and he said
[42:29] but that's what people make fun of he
[42:31] says she danced like that she spoke in
[42:33] tongue she acted like somebody was drunk
[42:36] you think you're going to get to heaven
[42:38] any different way the people make fun
[42:40] and they call that a bunch of idiots
[42:42] Paul said in the way that's called
[42:44] heresy that's crazy a heresy a Fanatics
[42:48] crazy well we are called that because a
[42:51] Supernatural is so much different from
[42:54] the what is carnal of the world that's
[42:56] right
[42:58] amen we know the world can the world
[43:00] that's carnal man cannot understand
[43:03] Supernatural
[43:05] things so if they can't understand it
[43:07] they want to just call it whatever they
[43:08] want to call it but Paul said to Agrippa
[43:12] I'm not mad I I'm not crazy as you think
[43:14] I am but in the way that's called heresy
[43:18] I worship the god of our fathers that's
[43:20] the way I do too I like that he says
[43:23] that's the way I do too I like that he
[43:25] said I would like to join in hands with
[43:27] Paul I would like to be on that day when
[43:30] he he's robed in the righteousness of
[43:33] Christ when I see him crown I want to
[43:36] have that same kind of robe that same
[43:39] kind of crown I because it's the same
[43:41] kind my Lord
[43:43] wore Hallelujah that's the reason I'm
[43:46] not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[43:48] Christ for it is the power of God unto
[43:51] Salvation And The Gospel came not in
[43:54] word only but in power and demonst rtion
[43:57] of the Holy Ghost that's the way of the
[43:59] Gospel is that's the way the word is the
[44:02] word made manifest in our
[44:05] hearts excuse me after Pentecost when
[44:09] these people received the Holy Ghost man
[44:12] was forced to make a decision is that of
[44:16] God or isn't that of
[44:18] God is that of God or isn't that of God
[44:22] and what they say they're drunk that's a
[44:25] bunch of Heretics they're a bunch of
[44:27] crazy people they're in
[44:30] delusion but Paul Saidi not mad I'm not
[44:33] crazy but I worship my God in the way
[44:37] they call heresy and what they say is
[44:41] the way I worship my god brother B said
[44:44] how could he say that or why would he
[44:46] say that he said out the Easter seal he
[44:48] said because he had the Easter seal he
[44:51] had he had been there when something
[44:53] happened I'm glad to join hands with him
[44:56] today in heart and say Paul why we have
[44:59] to preach the same word Paul preached we
[45:02] have to baptize the same way Paul
[45:07] baptized amen they want to call it
[45:09] heresy because you baptize in the name
[45:11] of the Lord Jesus
[45:14] Christ come on they they want to say
[45:16] you're crazy it's the father and the Son
[45:18] and the Holy Ghost but it's not what the
[45:21] word said it's not what the Bible said
[45:24] it's not what they did in the first
[45:25] church
[45:30] amen and so he said he spoken in such a
[45:34] way the words he said if anybody else if
[45:37] an angel from heaven come and say
[45:40] anything else than what I have said let
[45:42] him be a
[45:45] cursed so who's crazy
[45:49] now those that are saying what Paul said
[45:52] are those that are saying something
[45:53] different than what Paul said
[45:57] amen amen he preached Divine Healing he
[46:01] preached the power of the Resurrection
[46:03] he preached that Jesus Christ was the
[46:05] same yesterday today and forever he
[46:07] preached in visions and powers and
[46:10] manifestations of the spirit followed
[46:12] him you have to have the same message
[46:14] you have to have the same thing not a
[46:17] theology not some church doings but the
[46:19] power of God Pentecost the same
[46:23] seal amen amen the Seal of the Holy
[46:26] Ghost ghost God's true Easter seal amen
[46:29] it's your birth rights it's the
[46:31] credentials that you pass from death
[46:33] into life it's God working through you
[46:35] the same way he worked through Jesus
[46:38] Christ amen why because you receive the
[46:41] same
[46:45] experience you know stop here for a
[46:49] moment having a little trouble with my
[46:51] throat but I I I told this before but I
[46:54] I always think about it many times I've
[46:56] thought about about it and what I'm
[46:58] speaking about Heretics I remember being
[47:01] in in in Czech Republic and going down
[47:04] into a cave and seeing all the beautiful
[47:06] formations a beautiful cave way down
[47:08] taking this walk brother Danny steeman
[47:10] and brother Bogden I believe was a
[47:12] brother's name that took us down
[47:15] there and uh we walked down and we got
[47:17] to this one room and it was just total
[47:21] just everything is plain it was nothing
[47:23] there it was nothing hanging from the
[47:24] ceilings nothing coming up it was just
[47:26] in you can see Smoky looking stains on
[47:29] the ceiling and and the lady was talking
[47:31] in her her language and the guy that was
[47:33] taking us through and brother bog was
[47:35] translating and I knew she was saying
[47:37] something that I I wanted to hear and so
[47:39] I asked him I said what what's what's
[47:41] she talking about this room what's so
[47:42] important about this room I this is
[47:44] different than any other room that I've
[47:46] been through and she stopped there and
[47:48] she actually she actually was because
[47:50] you know CCH Republic is I don't know
[47:52] Poland I know is about 90 something per
[47:54] Catholic and Czech Republic's pretty
[47:56] close and and so there's a lot of CA
[47:58] Catholicism there and she said you know
[48:00] uh she said this this this is just this
[48:02] is nothing to see here this is just
[48:04] where Heretics had Church go
[48:07] ahead and man I I almost had myself a
[48:10] fit because I realized if she's calling
[48:13] this a
[48:14] heretic That's my kind of
[48:17] people amen because they had they tried
[48:20] to do whatever they had to go into a
[48:22] cave into hiding whatever they had to do
[48:24] for the gospel it was going to do it
[48:27] amen they had to die they would die if
[48:29] they had to give their life they would
[48:30] give their life and they call that a
[48:32] heretic because it did not come
[48:35] according to their own dogmas to their
[48:37] own teaching to the way they thought it
[48:39] should be or how they thought it and
[48:41] then maybe the majority of the world
[48:42] thought it should be like this and it's
[48:44] gotten that way I mean c Catholicism is
[48:47] one of the biggest uh biggest religions
[48:49] in all the world if not the biggest but
[48:52] just because it's the biggest does not
[48:54] mean it's the rightest
[48:57] it does not mean it's the one that you
[48:59] should follow after because amen Jesus
[49:01] said narrow is the
[49:03] way and few there be that find it amen
[49:07] and wide is the way amen that leads to
[49:09] destruction and many go down that path
[49:12] and we see them going one right after
[49:14] another after another after another and
[49:17] here we are amen with our our our
[49:19] Holiness and our righteousness upon us
[49:21] and it ain't a man-made Creed it ain't a
[49:24] man-made
[49:25] Dogma right
[49:27] amen if any of you sisters are wearing
[49:29] dresses amen because you think it's a
[49:31] dogma and a Creed and a a religious Duty
[49:34] amen you might as well go get you a pair
[49:36] of pants but if you're wearing it out of
[49:38] a love for God and for his word and what
[49:41] his word said amen that's what it's all
[49:44] about amen if you're wearing things
[49:46] because you think it's a Creed or this
[49:48] is the way it's got to be no it ain't
[49:50] the way it is it's the way God said it
[49:52] is and if God said it I believe it
[49:56] that's right
[49:59] people want to call it heresy they want
[50:00] to call you crazy and call you whatever
[50:02] they want to call you it doesn't matter
[50:04] what they call you that's
[50:07] right it only matters what he called you
[50:10] sir amen they can call you every kind of
[50:13] smudy name in the world but as long as
[50:14] he said you're his son and daughter what
[50:16] difference it
[50:19] make amen but you got to have the same
[50:22] message the same thing not a theology
[50:26] not this this is not
[50:28] theologies this is not Church
[50:33] doings we had that couple one time come
[50:35] to the old church you know
[50:37] and they thought that this was must be
[50:40] kind of like the Amish you know it's a
[50:42] decree from the head
[50:46] Bishop that all our sisters wear dresses
[50:49] and she tried to talk to one of our
[50:50] sisters I I think it was Sister Atlanta
[50:52] maybe but tried to talk to one of them
[50:54] and and said you know we we just get
[50:56] brother 10 him to not preach like that
[50:58] or something may you know maybe maybe we
[51:00] could you could all wear pants and she
[51:02] what the sister said well I it ain't
[51:04] because brother Tim preach it or don't
[51:06] preach it it's what the word of God says
[51:08] and so I remember I I remember just one
[51:11] work day amen we had there and they was
[51:13] trying to be a part and so they come to
[51:15] it or she came to it and and and she
[51:17] came up and showed up in a pair of pants
[51:19] she'd been wearing dresses at church but
[51:20] she shows up in a pair of pants and she
[51:22] gets out and she's looking all shameful
[51:24] and she said you know my husband my
[51:26] husband's an
[51:29] idiot she said she said he he told me
[51:31] there ain't no way them ladies are up
[51:33] there working and
[51:35] dresses said that's just a show at
[51:38] church you go in your pants they don't
[51:40] care that's every one of them going to
[51:41] be in pants she said and here I am the
[51:43] only one but why she could never
[51:46] understand that it wasn't just because
[51:47] somebody said or or or or or a bishop
[51:51] said or or some kind of R ruler said it
[51:53] was because God said it's not just a way
[51:57] called heresy it's the way called
[52:01] Holiness amen God has put it in our
[52:04] hearts and our lives to live the way
[52:06] that we
[52:09] live and I'm thankful for
[52:12] that as I I was talking about you know
[52:17] Sunday as just some thoughts been in my
[52:19] heart because you know you go to
[52:21] different thanksgivings and Christmases
[52:23] and birthdays or whatever you get around
[52:25] some of your own family and you're
[52:26] thinking man is this really who I came
[52:29] from or this really who I'm part of and
[52:31] and you know you get you look at all the
[52:33] stuff they got going on and the way they
[52:35] look and all that kind of stuff and
[52:37] you're like wow how H how in the world
[52:39] you know the only reason why you still
[52:41] have a sane mind is because of the grace
[52:44] of almighty God that's TR otherwise
[52:48] every one of us would be going straight
[52:50] to hell with everybody
[52:52] else amen but God rich in Mercy amen saw
[52:57] fit that we could hear from a voice from
[52:59] another real and realize it's the voice
[53:02] of God speaking to this
[53:04] generation and it ain't nothing to be
[53:06] ashamed
[53:10] about we got to have the same it's it's
[53:13] the credentials that that Birthright
[53:15] that that that change it's the
[53:18] credentials that you passed from death
[53:20] into life and God is working through you
[53:22] the same way he did Jesus Christ because
[53:25] that's these signs shall follow them
[53:28] that believe go ye into all the world
[53:30] after after Pentecost after the Seal of
[53:32] Easter was given of the Resurrection
[53:34] what was it the life that was in Christ
[53:37] amen was raised up come up and quickened
[53:40] with his church lives in his church to
[53:42] do the same things
[53:48] today but you know he says he says in
[53:51] another place he said I I get among
[53:52] Christians sometimes who claim to be
[53:55] sainted men and women of God and ashamed
[53:59] of that
[54:01] testimony they're ashamed he says to say
[54:04] Amen they're ashamed to sing the songs
[54:06] of Zion they're ashamed I I like to get
[54:09] he said I like to get among people who's
[54:11] not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[54:14] Christ that's right I'm happy to be
[54:16] identified tonight with people that are
[54:19] not
[54:20] ashamed you know you think about the
[54:22] world and the way they're going listen

[54:44] generation to be a light to a dark World

[54:52] don't have to be ashamed of your dress
[54:54] you don't have to be ashamed of your
[54:55] hair it's not because some preacher said
[54:58] so it's because God has ignited a fire
[55:01] on the inside of

[55:43] like heresy but yet they're not ashamed
[55:46] something has happened it means more
[55:48] than life to them it is life it's life
[55:51] eternal because they have accepted God's
[55:54] substitute they have accepted the lamb
[55:57] amen who was worthy to be slain before
[56:00] the foundation of the world we realize
[56:02] it's not our Holiness it's not our
[56:04] worthiness it's God's holiness it's
[56:07] God's worthiness it's God who placed us
[56:10] where we
[56:11] are so why should I be ashamed of
[56:14] it he said I like this kind of singing
[56:18] he I was back there praying for some of
[56:20] the people a few moments ago they've
[56:22] been brought in and said this not being
[56:24] a prayer service just to speak I was
[56:26] back there praying for them he said I
[56:29] could hear songs and I I could hear the
[56:31] Clapping of
[56:32] hands and he said my I seen some of them
[56:35] even get so full they run up down the
[56:37] floor and they call it dancing in the
[56:39] spirit he said the first time I was a
[56:40] Critic of that when I seen Pentecostal
[56:42] people dancing in the spirit I thought
[56:44] what is this must be a bunch of nonsense
[56:47] then I got to reading the Bible and
[56:48] found out dancing in where dancing in
[56:51] the spirit is and the devil copied it
[56:53] and put it in rock and roll and stuff
[56:55] but the real genuine dance comes from
[56:59] God well I mean if he can say that about
[57:02] dance can we also say the real Genuine
[57:04] Music came from
[57:06] God Amen it didn't come from the devil
[57:09] it came from God yes sure the devil
[57:11] perverts things and he makes it into his
[57:13] own and puts his own twist to it amen
[57:16] but it came from
[57:19] God abolutely but people got so ashamed
[57:22] of things they can't even have drums in
[57:24] their Church can't even have certain
[57:26] instruments in their church and if
[57:28] you're not careful you get right to the
[57:29] Church of
[57:30] Christ or brother Brandon would say the
[57:33] Church of Christ and he would go
[57:35] socalled so-called Church of
[57:38] Christ amen because why they put God
[57:41] completely out of
[57:46] it you know first time and I he said I
[57:49] looked that I thought it a bunch of
[57:51] nonsense but I saw it was there and and
[57:54] I saw that a dance was victory when
[57:56] David slew Goliath little boy by come
[57:59] dragging his head of this giant to the
[58:01] city and the people saw him yeah it
[58:03] caused them to dance amen why because
[58:06] they had the victory when Moses crossed
[58:08] the Red Sea amen and took the children
[58:10] of Israel on the other side and maram
[58:12] picked up the tambourine and began
[58:14] beating and dancing in the spirit he
[58:16] said if that ain't an oldfashioned
[58:18] Pentecostal meeting I never saw one in
[58:20] my life the trouble was with me I didn't
[58:22] have enough Victory yet but when you
[58:24] finally get that victory and the token
[58:27] of the blood of Jesus Christ comes upon
[58:29] you he said I remember David the great
[58:31] psalmist of the Bible when he' done
[58:33] something this great thing he was given
[58:35] Saul's daughter and here she was some
[58:37] kind of self-start self- style so-called
[58:40] believer and the Ark had been gone for a
[58:43] long time and here it came back the word
[58:47] was coming back to its rightful
[58:50] position to its rightful place and Pa
[58:53] and and David couldn't stand it no more
[58:55] it had been been exiled long enough it
[58:57] had been tied up long enough it had been
[58:59] sealed up long enough but the seals had
[59:02] come off and they were coming back to
[59:04] his right position and David got
[59:08] excited amen he couldn't help himself
[59:10] why cuz he saw the word coming back he
[59:13] knew what a restored Ark could do for
[59:15] him and the children of
[59:17] Israel oh Hallelujah if that ought not
[59:20] do something for us when we in this hour
[59:23] have seen a restored word come back with
[59:26] full power and full manifestation and
[59:29] the full Holy Ghost and the full
[59:31] anointing and the ability to heal and
[59:33] deliver and set free amen it ought to do
[59:36] something to our hearts when we realize
[59:38] the word that we have today the book
[59:40] that we have today is not a Clos book
[59:42] it's not probing at it no more it's not
[59:45] wondering what this and wondering what
[59:47] that is amen it's the open Word of God
[59:50] and we have the right to rejoice in what
[59:52] God has done for Our Generation because
[59:55] we know the value of the word in our
[59:58] midst we know what the word can produce
[1:00:01] it can produce an overcoming life it can
[1:00:04] produce a healing in your body it can
[1:00:06] produce salvation for your children that
[1:00:08] is the word loosed in our
[1:00:15] midst David singing But the daughter
[1:00:17] Saul's
[1:00:19] daughter embarrassed by that man's
[1:00:23] actions course David responsible if you
[1:00:25] know like that watch
[1:00:28] this it's my response too anybody want
[1:00:32] to peep in from the
[1:00:34] window that's where she was watching
[1:00:36] from peeping in you know she went to
[1:00:38] partake her apart she's peeping in and
[1:00:41] like look at all them people dancing
[1:00:42] what they
[1:00:45] crazy bunch of Heretics Holy
[1:00:49] Rollers we we're better than that we're
[1:00:51] growned up
[1:00:54] now you you're so gross up so old your
[1:00:57] bones are so creaky you can't even get
[1:00:59] limbered up again in the presence of God
[1:01:01] you're growed up all right you growed up
[1:01:04] into an old
[1:01:06] stag moaning and groaning when the
[1:01:09] presence of the Lord comes through
[1:01:11] because you don't want to move cuz
[1:01:13] you're too growed up go ahead and Peep
[1:01:16] in the
[1:01:18] windows this is what she was doing she
[1:01:20] wasn't a part of it but she had
[1:01:22] something to say about it well I'm
[1:01:23] ashamed of you for what well you're
[1:01:27] supposed to be a king you're supposed to
[1:01:29] hold yourself a certain way you're
[1:01:31] supposed to be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:01:32] and you're supposed to do certain things
[1:01:34] certain way it says
[1:01:37] who what denomination says that what
[1:01:40] headquarters says we got to do
[1:01:42] that says who amen here he was she was
[1:01:47] embarrassed and God cursed that woman
[1:01:50] with a
[1:01:51] curse she couldn't bring forth seed no
[1:01:54] more
[1:01:56] hello we got to be careful with our
[1:01:59] attitude towards the moving of the
[1:02:00] spirit don't we and be careful what we
[1:02:03] label it and what we say about it and
[1:02:05] what we you know because if we ain't
[1:02:07] careful we can blaspheme a real move of
[1:02:09] the Holy
[1:02:11] Ghost amen I I love how brother Brandon
[1:02:13] put it at one time when he talking about
[1:02:15] that about them girls dancing and and
[1:02:17] turning this church into a Tav he said I
[1:02:19] wouldn't say nothing about it because I
[1:02:21] didn't know if they might be right and I
[1:02:23] might be
[1:02:24] wrong take a lot of humility to be that
[1:02:27] kind of person amen well I just got to
[1:02:29] say something no you don't just got to
[1:02:30] say something Amen Let God prove who it
[1:02:36] is but he cursed her and she couldn't
[1:02:38] bring forth fruit amen of the king Lage
[1:02:42] no more amen later she would actually
[1:02:44] come forth and bring if I remember the
[1:02:46] Bible writes she would bring forth a son
[1:02:48] but it wasn't a son of David it wasn't
[1:02:50] amen the king's lineage could no longer
[1:02:53] flow through her she could do something
[1:02:56] of her own making she could make her own
[1:02:58] way she could make you know make believe
[1:03:00] all she wanted to but she could not
[1:03:02] bring forth the true seed of
[1:03:05] God and this is what is happening this
[1:03:08] day people have made fun of the Holy
[1:03:10] Ghost they've made fun of the move of
[1:03:11] the spirit they've called it all kinds
[1:03:13] of names they've driven right out of
[1:03:15] their assemblies to where there's
[1:03:16] nothing left but a bunch of dead sticks
[1:03:19] somewhere amen why and they cannot no
[1:03:22] longer bring forth the seed of God sure
[1:03:25] they can have a form of godliness but
[1:03:27] they deny the power
[1:03:29] thereof it's the world that's a world we
[1:03:31] living
[1:03:32] in she was
[1:03:35] embarrassed we don't have to be
[1:03:40] embarrassed I'm not AAR embarrassed a
[1:03:42] bit about God called
[1:03:47] musicians no no I'm not embarrassed at
[1:03:50] all about God called
[1:03:53] singers I'm not embarrassed all amen of
[1:03:57] what God has done in our generation what
[1:03:59] God has done in this church I'm not
[1:04:01] embarrassed about it I'm not ashamed of
[1:04:04] it but you know it's a
[1:04:06] paradox when God made so-called
[1:04:10] heresy all this noise shouting praising
[1:04:13] God speaking in tongues people who's
[1:04:15] despised and rejected called idiots and
[1:04:17] Heretics it's direct quote is a paradox
[1:04:19] when God the great father of all the
[1:04:21] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:04:23] chose a bunch of Heretics
[1:04:26] to bring Salvation to his
[1:04:30] church a bunch of Heretics to bring
[1:04:33] Salvation to his church instead of the
[1:04:35] well-trained
[1:04:37] ecclesiastical theological system that
[1:04:40] is a
[1:04:41] paradox but you know people God's people
[1:04:44] have always been viewed as crazy by the
[1:04:49] world those that around them is like
[1:04:51] you're
[1:04:52] nuts Abraham why are you leaving you got
[1:04:55] a good job job you got a good house you
[1:04:58] got a wife you got you got it going on
[1:05:02] man you got good salary you you got a
[1:05:06] good you know 4
[1:05:08] 401K why are you
[1:05:10] leaving cuz I Heard a
[1:05:13] Voice what this voice said it said to
[1:05:16] come and follow me it said to come into
[1:05:19] another land well what's in this land I
[1:05:21] don't know what's in this land how what
[1:05:24] he just said go with him and so I I
[1:05:27] believe what he said this voice spoke to
[1:05:29] me and could could you imagine that you
[1:05:31] would look at that and you're living
[1:05:33] next door to Abraham and you're like man
[1:05:35] this guy's nuts look he's got it all
[1:05:37] he's got a four-bedroom house he got all
[1:05:40] he got a he got enough donkeys and
[1:05:42] cattle and this that and the other he
[1:05:43] got all kinds of stuff he's crazy right
[1:05:47] where's he
[1:05:49] going going wherever this voice leads
[1:05:54] me it sounds sounded crazy and it just
[1:05:57] gets crazier and crazier his story if
[1:05:59] you look at it and on the outside around
[1:06:02] because there there sometime after he
[1:06:04] starts hearing the from the same voice
[1:06:07] that he's going to have a child and he's
[1:06:09] past bear childbearing and he's dead and
[1:06:12] dried up and his wife is dead and dried
[1:06:14] up and it seems impossible yeah and to
[1:06:18] the world it is
[1:06:20] impossible listen amen the doctors might
[1:06:23] think you're crazy for believing in the
[1:06:25] impossible possible but if God spoke it
[1:06:27] to you you better hold on to it until it
[1:06:30] happens cuz if God said it it's going to
[1:06:33] come to
[1:06:41] pass God told Abraham when he called him
[1:06:43] said I'm going to make you a father of
[1:06:45] Nations well that sounded pretty crazy
[1:06:48] from where you see the dust count to
[1:06:51] count the grains of sand see the stars
[1:06:53] count them you'll outnumber them what
[1:06:57] could you imagine an old man 75 years
[1:06:59] old and a woman 65 going down shaking
[1:07:01] shaking and in their and their agid
[1:07:04] shaking like that and it's down to the
[1:07:06] doctor said Doctor won you get the
[1:07:08] hospital ready now we're going to call
[1:07:10] you any night you know why we're going
[1:07:12] to call you why cuz we're going to have
[1:07:14] a
[1:07:17] baby I mean wouldn't it be wouldn't it
[1:07:20] be humanly understandable to call that
[1:07:23] man crazy
[1:07:26] I mean to look at him it's not it's
[1:07:28] impossible do says oh yeahuh soon you
[1:07:32] know as soon as they got got to a phone
[1:07:34] they said well you better go after that
[1:07:35] guy something wrong everybody that
[1:07:38] everybody that takes God at his promise
[1:07:41] is considered by the world
[1:07:48] crazy to many people you're considered
[1:07:50] crazy for even believing in a
[1:07:53] God to many people you are considered
[1:07:56] crazy for ever believing that this body
[1:07:59] is going to become young again and the
[1:08:01] dead in Christ is going to
[1:08:05] rise all
[1:08:08] I I I've had I've had this reoccurring
[1:08:11] dream happened again I believe it was
[1:08:12] last night or the night
[1:08:14] before almost the same thing maybe some
[1:08:17] things a little different but twice i'
[1:08:20] I've
[1:08:21] dreamed of the body change
[1:08:26] I've dreamed that I was just walking
[1:08:28] along and I happened to glance in a
[1:08:29] mirror and I realized hey things are
[1:08:33] different and I'm begin to realize in my
[1:08:35] feeling and in my dream I could I felt
[1:08:38] no pain in my body and it was and I just
[1:08:40] begin to run with all I had screaming to
[1:08:42] the top of my
[1:08:44] voice and I begin to see others and I
[1:08:46] begin to recognize amen them coming I I
[1:08:49] didn't recognize him at first but soon
[1:08:52] just after a little bit I began to dawn
[1:08:53] on me well this is so and so and this is
[1:08:55] so and so and this is so and so and I
[1:08:57] would wake up that's happened to me
[1:09:00] twice listen that's going to become more
[1:09:03] than a
[1:09:04] dream that's right they can call it
[1:09:07] crazy they can call it what they want to
[1:09:09] as I've said before one of these days
[1:09:11] you're going to call me
[1:09:13] gone amen one of these days I'm just
[1:09:15] going to vaporize out of here and be
[1:09:17] gone not by a nuclear bomb but by the
[1:09:20] bomb of the Holy Ghost amen it's come
[1:09:23] and fill my heart it's going to overtake
[1:09:25] this body and change every cell in it
[1:09:28] amen it's more than just a hop so story
[1:09:30] it's more than just a maybe it is Theus
[1:09:33] sayth the
[1:09:34] [Applause]
[1:09:37] Lord people can call it crazy if they
[1:09:39] want to call it
[1:09:40] crazy it's foolishness to the carnal
[1:09:43] mind amen
[1:09:46] faith is crazy to everybody but God and
[1:09:51] the one that's got the
[1:09:54] faith yeah
[1:09:57] there's things maybe you're believing
[1:09:58] for that I might think wow that's
[1:10:00] crazy but if God's giv you the faith to
[1:10:03] believe for it believe for
[1:10:11] it everybody that takes God at his
[1:10:14] promises is considered by the world
[1:10:18] crazy bunch of crazy
[1:10:22] people praise the Lord in the way is
[1:10:25] called heresy the way I worship the god
[1:10:27] of our father heresy means crazy we know
[1:10:29] it's foolishness to the carnal mind
[1:10:32] faith is crazy to everybody but God and
[1:10:37] the one who's got the faith I I've said
[1:10:40] that again on purpose every faith is
[1:10:43] crazy to
[1:10:45] everybody but God and the one who's got
[1:10:48] the
[1:10:50] faith cuz when those two omnipotence
[1:10:53] meet something has to take
[1:11:00] place Paul as we said was standing
[1:11:03] before
[1:11:05] grippa said I worshiped this way that's
[1:11:09] called
[1:11:10] heresy that great intellectual scholar
[1:11:13] had come to that place the way called
[1:11:18] heresy he used to one time think it was
[1:11:21] heresy that's right he used to be on the
[1:11:25] the other side matter of fact we know
[1:11:27] his story he was on his way to go throw
[1:11:29] a bunch of Heretics in jail but on his
[1:11:32] way he met that light
[1:11:35] yes he had that same experience a light
[1:11:38] came down over him amen it changed his
[1:11:41] name from Saul to Paul amen and made him
[1:11:43] the SE the first church M Church age
[1:11:45] messenger amen and here he was on one
[1:11:48] side a great intellectual
[1:11:50] scholar nobody could out argue the man
[1:11:53] the man was well versed h learn he had
[1:11:56] done all kinds of of learning at the
[1:11:58] feet of Gia but he said I have counted
[1:12:00] all of that as
[1:12:04] dung that's a pretty sharp word dung I
[1:12:07] don't know if some of you city Folk know
[1:12:09] what dung is how mean I ain't going
[1:12:13] ask worthless
[1:12:20] refuse nothing compared to what God has
[1:12:24] right
[1:12:25] if we can ever come to that part in our
[1:12:28] lives when we realize this world is
[1:12:30] nothing but worthless
[1:12:32] dung it's dogs
[1:12:36] vomit that's what it essentially is
[1:12:38] compared amen if if you can put it in
[1:12:40] English words and the worst thought
[1:12:42] thought of thing you can describe amen
[1:12:44] that's what the world is compared to the
[1:12:47] things of God but yet they people want
[1:12:50] to call me crazy cuz I want to choose
[1:12:52] what God has instead of what the world
[1:12:54] has
[1:12:57] I want to choose a life amen to have a
[1:13:00] wife that will stay true to me and
[1:13:02] children that will serve God Amen a home
[1:13:05] that that loves the Lord and things amen
[1:13:07] instead of a home that's tore up by
[1:13:09] drugs and alcohol and every kind of
[1:13:11] demon spirit that wants to have its way
[1:13:13] through that house listen that's not
[1:13:16] that's not crazy that's right that's
[1:13:19] real true sanity Amen to choose a house
[1:13:22] that can have the Holy Ghost in it that
[1:13:24] can have angels visited that can have
[1:13:27] healings take place and deliverance take
[1:13:29] place and salvation take place a house
[1:13:32] that the light can follow after and fall
[1:13:43] into you
[1:13:47] know uh I get amazed at this world and
[1:13:53] how their minds are so
[1:13:56] Twisted to where they can look at things
[1:13:59] so
[1:14:00] weird so their sin is so clouded them
[1:14:05] and so they this it's
[1:14:07] actually it's actually showed there in
[1:14:09] the Book of Revelation the smoke that
[1:14:11] comes out of the pit smoke has blinded
[1:14:14] people that's what it does we got a
[1:14:16] couple of firemen in here you know a
[1:14:19] smoke comes up and it gets in your
[1:14:21] eyeballs it ain't comfortable
[1:14:25] your eyes start watering you start
[1:14:26] trying to close them blink them and
[1:14:28] pretty soon you can't even open them no
[1:14:29] more because of the smoke that is there
[1:14:31] and taking you over and this is what the
[1:14:33] smoke is coming out of the bottom of
[1:14:35] this pit and it's taking people's
[1:14:37] minds and it's filling them with
[1:14:40] bitterness and cursings and sin of every
[1:14:43] kind until their eyes are so closed up
[1:14:46] that they couldn't see God if he was
[1:14:47] standing two foot in front of them
[1:14:49] that's
[1:14:52] right and it's only getting worse that's
[1:14:55] right you know people all happy about
[1:14:58] Trump you know Trump is brother Mike
[1:15:01] where was just bringing it to my
[1:15:02] attention again I heard it just today
[1:15:04] Trump is actually setting up the most
[1:15:07] Catholic cabinet
[1:15:11] ever hello
[1:15:15] somebody and that's supposed to be
[1:15:18] normal that's supposed to be great for
[1:15:21] America where are we at
[1:15:27] when the one the the that sits on
[1:15:29] Seven Hills is now sitting in America in
[1:15:32] her government in her cabinet and so
[1:15:34] infiltrating everything and that's
[1:15:36] supposed to be the new Norm that's
[1:15:38] supposed to be okay that's supposed to
[1:15:39] be make America great again it will not
[1:15:42] make America great again America will
[1:15:45] never be great
[1:15:46] again not because I said so but because
[1:15:49] a prophet said so she had her time to
[1:15:53] accept the Lord Jesus and she turned it
[1:15:55] away and from that time she's fell off
[1:15:58] and she'll fall off into a burning
[1:16:00] that's
[1:16:02] right so don't get your hopes up and
[1:16:04] Trump coming back in that's only a
[1:16:06] temporary
[1:16:07] thing and it can be just very
[1:16:12] temporary as I said before you know we
[1:16:15] we think well I was talking to brother
[1:16:17] Wayne about this too and people get all
[1:16:20] these ideas of about visions and how it
[1:16:22] should be and how it would be and how
[1:16:23] it's going to be and how and sometimes
[1:16:25] Visions can come to come to pass
[1:16:28] and might kind of look like it may not
[1:16:31] be sure of
[1:16:33] it and the whole time it was the
[1:16:36] vision well I thought it was going to be
[1:16:38] this way well it doesn't really matter
[1:16:40] how you thought it was going to be it
[1:16:41] matters how he thought it was going to
[1:16:44] be the point is amen whether she's the
[1:16:47] woman in purple or she's the woman that
[1:16:48] come into power whatever amen whether
[1:16:51] she is or whether she's not be ready
[1:16:54] that's it
[1:16:56] make your calling and election sure make
[1:16:59] sure that amen that your your your your
[1:17:01] anchor is tied to the right place and
[1:17:04] your and your Sals are set in the right
[1:17:06] direction amen make sure the direction
[1:17:09] that you're going is the right
[1:17:21] direction you know I don't know I can't
[1:17:24] get off of it
[1:17:26] this world thinks we're crazy for living
[1:17:29] a clean
[1:17:31] life they think we're crazy you for not
[1:17:33] smoking not drinking not doing drugs not
[1:17:43] womanizing they think you're crazy as a
[1:17:45] young couple if you hadn't Kissed before
[1:17:47] you got
[1:17:49] married or went further than that if you
[1:17:52] got before you got
[1:17:53] married they think you're crazy because
[1:17:56] you you know you come to church on a
[1:17:58] Sunday every Sunday
[1:18:00] what Wednesdays too are you
[1:18:05] crazy it's it's getting that way it's
[1:18:07] getting more and more people are falling
[1:18:09] away like never before from religion of
[1:18:12] all
[1:18:14] kinds amen they think you're crazy amen
[1:18:17] for raising your children to believe a
[1:18:18] certain thing to believe a certain way
[1:18:21] and to operate a certain way and your
[1:18:23] house to operate they think you're
[1:18:28] crazy and in this day you got to have
[1:18:30] more
[1:18:31] faith in ever to stay in the way that
[1:18:34] they call
[1:18:36] heresy because all the world is against
[1:18:39] you it's against the fibers of the
[1:18:45] family I I mean you know when they they
[1:18:47] made it where women could vote and women
[1:18:49] had rights you know what that was all
[1:18:51] about it wasn't about women having
[1:18:53] rights
[1:18:55] it was about women getting out of her
[1:18:57] place in her in the
[1:18:59] home now I know it gets real touchy
[1:19:02] nowadays because this world has tried to
[1:19:04] make it to where a man and a woman both
[1:19:06] have to work amen but a wife's place is
[1:19:09] in her
[1:19:10] home that's the Bible That's the word
[1:19:13] that's the message that's what we
[1:19:14] believe and there nothing to be ashamed
[1:19:17] of Amen but they made it that way you
[1:19:19] know why they made it that way cuz they
[1:19:20] wanted to have double the tax base and
[1:19:22] then they wanted to take the mother out
[1:19:24] of the home home so they can get a hold
[1:19:25] of the children quicker so they could
[1:19:27] start move messing with their minds and
[1:19:29] turn them into what they
[1:19:31] believe this is the why we're in the
[1:19:34] conditions that we are now amen because
[1:19:36] Satan has come against what God has
[1:19:39] called righteous that's right and what
[1:19:42] God is called right and what God is
[1:19:45] called true and he's come against it
[1:19:47] Time After Time After Time and he shaved
[1:19:50] it off and he shaved it off and he
[1:19:51] shaved it off and he shaved it
[1:19:53] off that's what lay to see it does to
[1:19:55] you it's like sandpaper that's shaving
[1:19:58] off against your
[1:20:00] convictions I don't mean that much no
[1:20:02] more that don't matter so much no more
[1:20:06] this don't happen you don't and it's
[1:20:08] just constantly rubbing on
[1:20:10] you trying to get you into a place of
[1:20:13] lukewarmness to World it don't matter it
[1:20:16] who cares
[1:20:18] anyhow don't really matter if we do this
[1:20:20] or do that or we don't do this or do
[1:20:22] that and before you know it your love
[1:20:24] for God starts
[1:20:26] waning and you start getting colder and
[1:20:28] you start pulling away from the house of
[1:20:30] God Satan knows what he's doing he' been
[1:20:32] doing it for 6,000
[1:20:36] years but it's important that we have
[1:20:40] the new birth it's important that we
[1:20:43] have that that anchor to Hold Us in
[1:20:45] times of situations that we don't know
[1:20:48] how things are going to work out or
[1:20:50] what's going to happen amen and so
[1:20:52] something Turns Upside Down in your life
[1:20:54] you still have have a hold there that
[1:20:56] when you seem to be dangling it's still
[1:20:58] holding that's right when you seem to be
[1:21:00] falling it's still holding when you seem
[1:21:02] to be all tore up inside it's still holy
[1:21:06] yes
[1:21:12] sir I I actually preached at a message
[1:21:16] camp three services and I got told at
[1:21:19] the end of that that I preached the Holy
[1:21:22] Ghost too hard
[1:21:26] praise God if that's what I was guilty
[1:21:29] of I'll take
[1:21:32] it at least I didn't preach psychology
[1:21:34] too hard or theology too hard amen but I
[1:21:38] preach the life of Jesus Christ this is
[1:21:40] what's happen amen because people are
[1:21:42] ashamed of a holy ghost filled life and
[1:21:44] what it
[1:21:45] produces they want just enough of God
[1:21:47] and enough of the world to mix the we're
[1:21:49] not
[1:21:51] mixers this is why he called us a
[1:21:53] peculiar people a chosen
[1:21:55] generation I've separated people we are
[1:21:59] not
[1:22:08] mixers
[1:22:09] said he said them Scholars that day
[1:22:12] those Jews fine men their organizations
[1:22:13] of Pharisees Sadducees rodians whatever
[1:22:15] they might be all the great
[1:22:16] organizations Jesus said you're the
[1:22:18] blind you lead the blind well did Isaiah
[1:22:21] speak of you you have ears and cannot
[1:22:22] hear and cannot and eyes and you cannot
[1:22:25] see because Isaiah said this in the
[1:22:27] spirit therefore God Of Heaven has
[1:22:28] blinded your eyes you're doing like Eve
[1:22:31] did accepting the indivi intellectual
[1:22:33] side and knowing nothing of the spirit
[1:22:35] of God but God along holds a key he
[1:22:37] expresses the same thing in previous
[1:22:39] scriptures there a while ago amen what
[1:22:41] does man say that I am that Peter said
[1:22:43] Thou Art the Christ the son of living
[1:22:45] God blessed art thou Simon the son of
[1:22:47] Jonah Flesh and Blood never revealed
[1:22:49] this to you my father which is in heaven
[1:22:51] therefore no school no Theologian no
[1:22:54] teaching of the Bible among any school
[1:22:55] that knows anything about it they can't
[1:22:57] know anything about it it's impossible
[1:22:59] them God has hid it from their senses
[1:23:01] from their eyes the very elected
[1:23:03] teachers everything it's a personal
[1:23:05] individual affair with that person and
[1:23:09] God that Christ is revealed to them and
[1:23:12] if they say he's been revealed to me
[1:23:14] then the life that Christ produced here
[1:23:16] in the Bible is the same life Christ
[1:23:18] will produ in you that's and there's
[1:23:21] nothing to be ashamed of that
[1:23:25] Paul would say it like this he said 'I
[1:23:27] don't come in Excellency of speech or
[1:23:29] wisdom declaring you the testimony of
[1:23:31] God I never said I'm you know I'm doctor
[1:23:34] so and so I I I but I am determined not
[1:23:38] to know anything among you save Jesus
[1:23:42] Christ and him
[1:23:44] crucified that's a good determination
[1:23:47] right
[1:23:48] there I don't want to know everything
[1:23:51] about you I just want to see Jesus
[1:23:54] Christ Christ crucified and the blood
[1:23:56] applied to your
[1:23:58] life as I was here with you in weakness
[1:24:01] and fear and much trembl in my speech my
[1:24:04] beseeching was not with enticing words
[1:24:06] of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration
[1:24:08] of the spirit and power of God there is
[1:24:11] the gospel the power of God the
[1:24:13] demonstration he didn't say go teach he
[1:24:15] said go preach that c so our faith amen
[1:24:19] that we have in this way is not
[1:24:21] dependent on what some man said or even
[1:24:25] what you
[1:24:28] say your faith should not ever to be
[1:24:30] dependent on what you
[1:24:32] say or what you
[1:24:35] think or what your heart
[1:24:38] feels people can be wrong following
[1:24:41] their
[1:24:43] heart well I my heart really likes this
[1:24:46] young man and this young man's in the
[1:24:48] world and he's he don't he's not he's
[1:24:51] not even a Christian your heart's wrong
[1:24:54] right can't split it however you want to
[1:24:57] split it your heart's
[1:24:59] wrong well if I get married to him I can
[1:25:02] share with them the message and then all
[1:25:03] will be okay it doesn't is not g well I
[1:25:06] got this one over here did that and that
[1:25:07] over there did that and that one over
[1:25:09] there
[1:25:10] happened you're not guaranteed nothing
[1:25:14] you're not promised anything your
[1:25:15] heart's wrong your motives are wrong
[1:25:19] your objectives are going are wrong and
[1:25:21] your end is going to be wrong
[1:25:26] your faith should not stand in the
[1:25:28] wisdom of men but in the power of
[1:25:32] God this is the only thing that'll keep
[1:25:35] you in this way called heresy because
[1:25:38] there's going to be plenty of people
[1:25:39] that's going to make fun of you that's
[1:25:42] right and they're going to mock you and
[1:25:45] they going to call you this and say
[1:25:47] about this about that and well this was
[1:25:50] say I don't care what they're saying all
[1:25:53] I care is what he
[1:25:55] says that's the only one that I'm
[1:25:57] looking
[1:25:59] to I'm reminded of that boy that was
[1:26:02] playing that
[1:26:04] violin he's playing his his
[1:26:07] concert he plays it and he just brings
[1:26:10] the people to their feet with such a
[1:26:12] passion that was flowing out of him of
[1:26:14] the song that he was playing and they
[1:26:17] come to their feet at the end with this
[1:26:18] big Crescendo and they're shouting his
[1:26:20] name and they're they're clapping their
[1:26:22] hands they're throwing their hats in the
[1:26:24] air and he's looking up at one place in
[1:26:26] a
[1:26:28] balcony up in that one place was the man
[1:26:30] who had tutored him who had given him
[1:26:33] the instruction who had taught him how
[1:26:35] to play this violin how to become who he
[1:26:38] was and it was the only one he was
[1:26:40] concerned about was getting his
[1:26:44] approval listen if you start worrying
[1:26:47] about getting just one man's app one
[1:26:50] person one God's approval that's right
[1:26:53] and quit worrying about all the others
[1:26:55] on Instagram Facebook
[1:27:00] Snapchat come
[1:27:06] on it'd make our lives a whole lot more
[1:27:08] simpler if we only concern our thoughts
[1:27:11] on what does he
[1:27:13] think they may call it heresy they may
[1:27:16] laugh at me they may make fun of me they
[1:27:19] may make jokes about me they may say all
[1:27:21] kinds of things about me but it doesn't
[1:27:23] matter I'm looking up to the
[1:27:25] one who give me the ability to walk in
[1:27:28] the way that I'm
[1:27:29] walking who's giv me the strength to
[1:27:32] stand where I'm standing who' given me
[1:27:35] this promise this faith that I could
[1:27:38] have in my heart to believe these things
[1:27:40] are possible I'm only looking to him and
[1:27:43] to no other it'll make your life a lot
[1:27:46] more
[1:27:48] simpler let's by our hearts
