you're going to have to be changed too amen so we're thankful to God for his grace to us and my goodness he you all young people up front this is your meeting that's where we want you the adults we love them to be in the back in this meeting this is your about you and about your meeting and uh you know it makes it a little hard for you I know but we don't allow the savings of seeds so you know come come and occupy a seat that way every everything kind of gets treated fairly and whatever and of course you know we have to talk about a few rules and I myself think it's a disrespectful to chew gum in church and you know uh uh I I think you know if you are here you ought to be attentive to the word of God and and also be respectful to the house of God and and I I just want to tell you you're the greatest group of young people on the face of the Earth and you have my heart and I love you with all my heart and I appreciate each one of you your testimony for the Lord and and your Zeal for him and your desire to serve him and and you're the best of the best and I I tell you that that's the truth every time I get a report um I even got a call today from another camp that we had in in Texas there for a while and said you were our favorite group that we ever had there's something about believers amen we we we have an atmosphere about us and that atmosphere um changes those that around us and it brings a wonderful feeling of peace and and joy and uh so you know just having you together with us this weekend gives us a chance to share together and enjoy in the great things of God and and feed off of one another create an atmosphere you know around us for somebody else that can receive something from God and just think you know if you misbehave in church and you cause somebody else to uh miss their blessing and their opportunity well you said well it ain't for me well what if it's for the person next to you so you know be respectful and and uh do your part to pull on the word of God and and and just comparefully believing and and uh you know if we of course want you to sing songs we're looking forward to your specials we we got some of the greatest Talent on the face of the Earth and it ain't manufactured stuff it's real it comes from real heart said that our uh love the Lord Jesus and um so we want you to sing and if you have a song or um you know you special song you can see uh brother Timothy or brother Michael Dexter brother Michael's back in the sound booth right now but see them you know and let let us know that you have a special song don't wait till the last meeting because um time will be up and let me just tell you don't wait to get something out of the meeting to the last meeting you can start tonight let's make this count you know you're driven a long ways you've sacrifice to come and everything else so make every moment count and you're in the presence of God and things are things are wonderful are going to be happening all

know they went back and they just had a camp high and it was you know and they went back well okay there may be some of those but there's been many of them this had lasting experiences amen so you know even even if in this meeting you just get a Justified State and you repent of your sins you made a start you can build from that if you if you're Justified you can be Sanctified and God cleanse sin out of your life and you're in a Sanctified condition you can be filled with the Holy Ghost and if you got the Holy Ghost guess what you can get a refilling amen get filled with the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost become a light a burning light that nothing can put out amen we want to say we so appreciate you and I know I know this weekend you're going to show respect to your counselors and not give them a difficult time they spend their own money pay their own way pay their own camp fee to come and sacrifice of the time many of them spend vacation time to be here don't give them a difficult time I know you won't you're that kind of young people that show respect and love and consideration and and you know we we don't pull a bunch of pranks around here we we expect you to be young adults and to behave as such that's what I know you are and that's what I know you're capable of so that's what I expect of you because you're that kind of people and I appreciate you very much for that for you all of you you know the sermons will be available for streaming that eveninglight.net also on YouTube and probably Facebook am I going in and out what's going on with me all right let's see if I

registered here at the camp we do requests that you allow our paid campers to go through the lines first and so we have meals set at ten dollars you know out here at the around there's a uh you know lots of different areas out here um woods and so on that it's a big Campground and we're going to be using this areas here around this we we don't um have archery classes and things like we don't have enough time we just got we got like from Friday and Saturday and then we're we're leaving Sunday so you know we don't have time to do we're not here for a week like um other campers might do and so we're just around in this area we have the um the the basketball court we have um volleyball courts and hopefully the rain will hold off and we can have some of that but um stay out stay out of the woods just stay out here around this area sometimes you little guys like to go around find the little ponds and catch the frogs their sewer ponds you may not want them frogs so stay out of the ponds we don't want to dig you out we don't send anybody home in a little box so you know just everybody you know just kind of stay around uh you can close and you know within in our dorm and lighted areas

if you've got a rock on a finger well okay make sure it didn't come out of gum machine and you know if it didn't come out a gum machine and you're holding her hand I'm not going to say a lot but you

the campground she can hold one hand you the other wouldn't that look cute yeah I think it does so you know we're going to be announcing time for you to when you're going to go to the dorms and even

DVDs anymore those things are of the past but the services be online so everything else is taken care of we're just glad you're here and we want to invite the Lord to be here we want him in this camp meeting with you know we could go through all of this and if he didn't come it wouldn't be worth it what we've come for so I want you to stand together with me tonight and I want you to ask God to come by your way to speak to your heart to deal with you to come by your pew to deal with you in a very special way God wants to make himself real to you I remember some years ago somewhere about right in here there was a stage all the way across the auditorium was back this way a gymnasium on that side when Hurricane Rita come through knocked a bunch of trees down they turned this one thing into a big Auditorium and put the cut the lumber up and put it on the walls made a beautiful Auditorium we'd had a prayer line it was doors there on each side of the stage where where would enter into the the gym area without a prayer line and I'd prayed for about 400. and I after praying for hours for different needs I was really exhausted just catching my breath looked out over the congregation most of them was all gone I thought God what in the world has happened who dismissed young people are they all at it the Snack Shack and everything where were they at someone tapped me on the shoulders one that he can said come look and out over here on this side kneeling everywhere across was young people gathered around each other and praying and calling out on God and I walked by and hear a young person said it's real it's real it's real I've always heard about it but I've experienced it for myself God's real listen he's real he'll change your life in a moment you will never be the same when he touches your life the life you've known here before is nothing compared to the life you'll live walking with him changes you forever in his presence make something out of you that the world cannot make out of you what do they have to offer the dope the crime the wine the women the men the whatever that's all they have to offer we have something to offer to make a real lady out of you a real man out of you make me bring forth real real children real young people things that you would desire that's what we have on this side but we have more than that we have reservations for a new body for a house not made with hams that's Eternal in the heavens we have a place that we're going to go when all the World falls apart and the world has fallen apart all around you but we have a

Pew to your life he's coming to you [Music] the word is going to come forth and touch your life tonight the Holy Spirit will come and deal with your soul and with your heart minister to the minister without him we can do nothing but we have called anointed ministers to come this weekend men that we know who knows the presence and the power of God who have experienced him who when they preach they find that channel of anointing and Minister under that anointing and as the word Goes Forth sick or healed devils are cast out the people of God are delivered and edified and built up and strengthened and I've asked for this weekend for brother Donnie Reagan to come and Minister he'll be ministering tonight tomorrow night I also have brother Ron Spencer back with us again that'll be ministered we're so thankful to God amen for another camp meeting with brother Ron Spencer we love and appreciate him thank God for [Music] his hand upon his life in this past year you've never seen a miracle come on you're looking at one here's a miracle amen God working in the miraculous I was just at his place the other day we were celebrating three years three years since the doctors told him he only had a couple of months left to live right three years he's defied All Odds so are you you're going to defy All Odds and be an overcomer in laodicea amen you're not going to be left behind but you're taking a Rapture in this last day we also have brother Andrew Spencer that will be ministering so God's got a table prepared and the word to come forth make room for it in your heart right now brother Donnie and I go back a long ways probably maybe um 35 years [Music] we were both a lot younger back then but you know we're not bringing in experienced Ministry we're bringing men with experience men who know their God and can do exploits you're looking at battles scarred veterans that are standing before you saying you can make it I've often said I gave my heart to the Lord when I was five I have ministered this gospel this message since I was 15. next year I'll be turning 70. don't tell me you can't overcome in this this age don't tell me you can't live a Victorious Life I'm a testimony of a young person in this message raised up by the power of God that is overcome in this day and you can be an overcomer too amen you may never preach like I preach but I'll tell you what your life will be a witness everywhere you go a testimony of Jesus Christ that is the same yesterday today and forever that his power is real we're going to invite brother Donnie to come tonight and I want you just to recognize the Lord is here and he's now going to speak to your heart invite him as I said to your Pew he is here [Music] is here amen [Music] he is here [Music] I will bless his name again he is here I want you to listen closely it's going to be calling your name amen that's what it's about the word calling your name speaking to you personally a personal God he's here and he can touch him you will never be the same God bless you really tell me ever be the same let's sing it again [Music] now only holy I will bless his name again he is here [Music] listen closely hear him call me now your name is here and you can touch it you will never be the same do we believe that with all of our hearts thank you if we do there's nothing absolutely nothing that will be impossible for us these days when we are gathered together we greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus what an honor it always is to stand before the people of God to be able to speak of our lovely Lord and his word the great things that he has done is doing and is going to do I know it's the first night you're probably tired you've traveled but let's look into the word a little bit um turn with them if you would Romans chapter 4 verse 17. certainly agree each of you all the ministers that were here so appreciate mother Tam once again having this camp for the use so appreciate the other ministers that will be speaking brother Ron with Andrew looking forward to that what the Lord has given them for these times that we're together I want to speak to you tonight on facts versus truth facts verses truce now you may think they're the same thing but actually sometimes they're not I've been listening to a song the last six seven months something like that and it deals with this about sometimes the facts can be stacked up against you but the truth is God's on your side brother Aaron Oglesby was up with us last Sunday and he touched on this same thing let me read to you what the word fact actually means a piece of information about circumstances that exist or events that have occurred let me read to you again a piece of information not the entire scope of the information but a piece of the information about circumstances that exist or events that have occurred Romans chapter 4 verse 17. as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him who he believed now this of course speaking of Abraham and the promise that God had made to Abraham which is our father who quickened the Dead and call us those things which be not as though they were so he calls things that were not actually in existence yet but he called them address them spoke to them and dealt with them as if though they were already there now listen to verse 18. who against hope believed in Hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not now these are the facts that will get you in trouble he considered not his own body now dead so it was a fact his body was now dead here's another fact when he was about a hundred years old another fact neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb so now these are facts but he believes something different [Applause] notice in verse 20 he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but were strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform are there any of his children here tonight that believe the same thing [Applause] verse 22. and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now because he believed God this way God imputed this face to this man for righteousness which is right standing with God I mean a lot to be remembered tonight as we pray just raise your hand there before the Lord heavenly father is we begin these days together we are so thankful Lord for the opportunity we're expecting you Lord to come and do what you always do heal the sick Save The Lost fill with the Holy Ghost set the captive free cast out evil spirits that's what we're used to seeing you do and we believe the father in these days that we're together that you are going to do it once more it is our expectation that you will meet with us and once again there will be lives that will be changed and transformed speak to us tonight father in this beginning service help me Lord that I can be sensitive to the spirit of God lead me down the direction of the needs of these people you're the only one that can custom fit a sermon that would be able to go to Every Hungry Heart and no doubt we're only seeing a small portion of those who are hearing tonight those that have will be streaming and those that will go back so Lord the audience is vast and the needs are many but your power is so great to us and not father in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask him and the Saints said sure do you do a bad Mac ain't you ah there you go God bless you can be seated I'm sure all of us have heard it said that the devil cannot tell the truth but in reality that's not the truth because the devil can tell the truth when it's to his advantage and he will actually use truth and facts against us if we will allow him to you know facts are something that we as the people of God our faith is based upon facts it's based upon truths but sometimes our enemy will take certain facts and blend them in and misrepresent them in order to defeat us I want you to think just a minute might take a few minutes to catch this thought but what does Satan use against many of us in order to get us discouraged our failures our weaknesses is there are those facts and he will say well you've done this and you've done that why even go to that Youth Camp how many have you been to and you left you didn't get what you thought other people said they got this and that and the other they run and they jumped and they hollered and you was just as sincere as they were and you went there with needs of your life and yet you left and you were so disappointed knowledge that the fact for some of you it probably is so he will try to accumulate those facts and convince you that why should you even go well you've already put forth the effort and you're here tonight oh yeah he said well there's no need for you to really get in it'll be like it's been before no doubt there's some of you sitting here tonight and the facts are you have addictions in your life no doubt there's some of you sitting here tonight and you have problems with pornography you have problems with besetting sins and the facts are sure and Satan will use them against you but the truth is Jesus loves you the truth is you can be delivered from every one of those problems that you have now I'm not sure tonight to tell you that some of those facts do not exist you know Abraham did not say he was not an old man Abraham did not say Sarah was not an old woman Abraham did not say his body was not dead he did not say Sarah's womb was not dead but what he refused to say was that those present circumstances was going to keep God's promise from coming to pass in their life you realize that God's word is so profound and the prophet said it over and over again that the Lord Jesus is the high priest of our confession and that he can only do for us in heaven as we say on the earth that he's already done it for us so if the devil can keep us down in the mouth and all weary and all warning you look at your defeats and you look at your past failures and you say well that's probably who I'll be all in my life I'll agree with you until you get to a spot that you can get above your failures and above your past and above all your shortcomings the prophet said you will never live any higher than you confess that you are somebody say Amen so you see the devil will try to accumulate all of those things that he calls as facts and say you might as well just go ahead and admit it you will never be an overcoming Christian you'll always be one of those around the message that just makes it from one Youth Camp to another well no doubt there are some people and they will be those type of people but that will be up to you whether or not you want to be that way if you don't want to live from one youth meeting to another and from one use banquet to another then there's nothing in God's word that says you have to unless you will accept less than what God has for you tonight I believe that the prophet of God tells us a man or woman can live so completely surrendered to God that the devil don't know what to do with again oh can you imagine that you get up every morning and you don't shake and tremble but when you get up young person and you set your foot down on the floor and the devil says oh no here he comes again oh no here she comes again another child of God another young person filled with the Holy Ghost another young person that believes God's word I heard about the Tim getting a little of his testimony there about how he was saved as a young man don't you admire God doing something like that in our brother's life keeping him through all of these years I too was saved as a young man given my heart to the Lord when I was 12. started to preach when I was 18. been pastoring for over 40 years now I'm 67 in a few months and yet I've got a greater determination tonight than I had it when I was 12. I've got a greater determination tonight to stand for the truth and preach the word but brother Donnie you're an old man don't tell me that I don't know it yet I'm still acting like I'm a young man I'm still behaving like I'm a young man and as a matter of fact I'm more threat to Hell tonight than I was when I was 20. I'm more threat to Hell tonight than I was when I was 40. now you realize it depends on what you and I want to be it's not just what Satan dictates and says well you'll never be this and you'll never be that whose report are we going to believe are we going to believe what the devil says or are we going to believe what God says well the facts may be stacked up against you tonight but let me tell you something Jesus is here he's already here on the very first night don't wait till tomorrow night don't wait till tomorrow morning why not get set free right here tonight why not get filled with the Holy Ghost right here tonight but for the dawn of the fact shall against me they might be but all the facts do not change God's word that he used to say yesterday today and forever greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world that's God's truth let's use a few Bible characters here if we can tonight in the days of Noah the facts are it never had rained you Louisiana folks you find that hard to believe right those of you that come to youth can't find it hard to believe but yet it never had rained before how peculiar and strange that it must have been when this man stands out and preaches against the facts now think of that they had never seen rain clouds they had never heard thunder they had never seen lightning and God introduces a word to Noah that had never been said before and that was the word rain now you imagine when he got up and started preaching that it's going to rain and there's coming a flood God changed this man's vocabulary and they must have said brain what is rain well it's going to come a rain that it's going to come afloat flood what is a flood well we have no proof it's ever rained before and it hadn't it had never there's never been the clouds that gathered together because God had so designed the Earth that the Earth had its own watering system built in the soil itself notice in Genesis 2 5 and every plant of the field before that was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the Earth and there was no man to till the ground and there went up amidst from the earth so God irrigated the Earth with a Mist so when the earth started getting a little bit dry God just turned the irrigation pipes on and the myths come upon the earth and the whole thing was watered everywhere and yet God God started telling this man but it's going to rain imagine no I said Lord what you say right what in the world is rain I've never even heard of rain before well let me explain it to you know how it works actually the moisture and the precipitation will drop down from the heavens and see them coming from the earth up oh Lord how can that be I've never even seen that happen for it well no it's like this when I divided the waters from the waters I pulled a great vaporous canopy over the top of the earth it's held up by moisture and humidity high pressure and low pressure and so on I have kept a high pressure over the Earth since the day that I made it but I'm fixing to allow a low pressure to come in in order for the cumulus clouds to be able to build and the water vapor will start forming on the earth and then it'll start dropping down I know itself what a miraculous thing lord well I never even heard of it before the facts were it never had rain the facts were there were no clouds the facts were that there never been any lightning or it is under but the truth said it's going to rain now you imagine you could have missed church for 45 years and stay out of church for 45 years and one day you decide I'm going back to Hero Pastor Noah well you know what the last sermon that he preached when you was there he was preaching about rain well this time you come back after 45 years and Noah gets up and said glory to God I'll tell you one thing I was out praying this morning and I heard them birds of Sinner I looked up there and I saw them beautiful scars and I thought how wonderful it was it was such an awesome day and then I got to thinking it's gonna rain and they say Lord have mercy I ain't been to church in 45 years and he's preaching the same thing again that's right because that was the message of the hour don't get tired of your pastor preaching about the seven things don't get tired of your literature preaching about the Seven Seals and the Seven searches this is our nation this is our time I'm just assured I said hey there are young people sitting in this place tonight that are going to be raptured in a moment in a twinkling of an eye by the power of God so the facts said it never had been it couldn't be but the truth is Genesis 7 11. and the 600th year of Noah's life in the second month the 17th day of the month the same day were all The Fountains of the great deep you see in France the water didn't just come from up here to come from down here the aquifers that are in the ground God released above and God released beneath so the aquifers in the ground began to ooze where all this was coming out in the nice form of a mist and they started exploding the aquifers from the ground and they started pouring out from the heavens The Fountains of the deep broken up and the windows of Heaven were open and the rain the rain the word that had never been spoken yet was now made manifest so facts verse faith and face one out you understand now let's let's think about the man that we read about here in the Book of Romans chapter four Abraham and we all are familiar with his life and what a great man that he was I can't wait to meet him myself I know so many Avenues to Face by which God projected his word to this man but we're all familiar with the one about Isaac that God had promised he was going to have a son and be a father of many nations now the facts were Abraham was too old another fact was Sarah was too old another fact was his manhood was gone Sarah's ability to conceive was God her heart could not take childbirth her blood pressure could not deal with childbirth her milk veins were dried up what am I quoting to you facts facts neither of them have the nerves to deal with a newborn baby can you imagine a hundred year old man and a 90 year old woman getting up with a baby squalling and screaming and changing his diaper all night long and it getting its days and nights all mixed up and getting a colic and getting everything else today no way in the world they've gotten and the nurse a deal with a newborn another Homer Longoria said he loves to see the headlights whenever his his kids is bringing them grandchildren to see him but he also loved to see the tail lights as good as going back out the driveway well that's the way it is when your grandparents and you've got them grandchildren and they're so crying one reason they're crying is because mama daddy can take them back home so you imagine this man and woman and the devil was pointing to every one of these facts be sensible man there's no way you can father a child there's no way this woman could give birth to a child face the facts that's what he wants to tell you that's what he wants to tell you face the fact that's what he wants to tell my daughter face to facts Erica she's not facing the fact she's looking at God's promise Hallelujah that the doctor say this one said that one said I don't care what they say I want to know what does God say Max versus truth and Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born unto him and Sarah said God has made me to laugh so all that here will life with me amen amen and she said who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah could have get children suck for I have borne him a son in his old days I want you to notice how the Bible identifies this Moses did not quote her a son I've given him a son and his old body but he says his old age you see Satan loves to take the facts and use them against him remember brother Brandon was standing there at the funeral of his wife and his wife laying in the casket and the devil started whispering to him and he said everything he told me was the truth not long ago when we were working on our church I stopped at a little store to get me some breakfast and I walked into a place there the manager was sitting there and she was shaken and quivering crying I said man you okay she said I have seizures she's just sitting there crying and shaking so I thought Lord I'm gonna offer to pray for us I said you mind if I pray for you she said no please it's all laid my hands on her you mean you wasn't ashamed of the public place good new snow might be time for Jesus to manifest himself in the public place so I laid my hand on her and prayed for it in a few minutes I noticed she stopped crying she stopped shaking she got up out of her chair smiling thank me as I left that was a wonderful thing but before I got to church that morning got down the road just a mile or so to work don't you know that devil come right in my vehicle me brother Ron and said uh-huh now he heard you praying for that woman which had bob hair makeup on and pass and how many times have you prayed for your daughter she's still sick [Music] what did he tell me a fact come on Sheldon you think he ain't told that man the same thing how many people have you prayed for him look at you and said fights yeah but it ain't all the truth it's only a piece of the unfoldation [Applause] thank you you imagine Moses and the children of Israel as they come to the Red Sea him looking around I'm thinking Lord what in the world have you done to us now where are we gonna go oh God didn't exactly tell him what was going to happen God lets him get right up to it and then Moses cries out and God said why are you crying what you want me to say speak what well let's look at some facts the sea had never rolled back and stood up before this sea had never obeyed a man's voice before facts facts it would be totally unscientific to believe such a thing could even happen well come on now no one had ever walked on the sea floor had not walked on the sea floor being totally dry fact after fact after fact oh but here's the truth Exodus 14 21 and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord closed the sea to go back by a strong East Wind all that night I made the sea dry land and the waters were divided and the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground so now are we going to believe Fox are they going to believe this now historically all concept are nods are heavy yep yep that's right I believe it I believe it but what do you believe when You Face these same things [Applause] it's easy to amen a past Victory it's not so easy to amen a present storm oh my goodness praise the Lord let me say that again it is easy to amen a past Victory oh yes sir I believe that I believe that but we find it much harder to amen so be it Lord You're gonna bring it to pass with a right in the middle of a storm anybody ever been there anybody maybe you're there tonight and you don't know which way to go you don't know which direction to turn but just remember the same Lord God that led Moses and the children of Israel through their Red Sea he will part the waters for you my brother he will park the waters for you my sister because he loves you just as much as he loves them so what would it be facts or truce [Music] so the doctors may tell you if you stop taking your insulin you will go into a coma and you will never come out again right but all of a sudden a revelation drops down inside of your heart that you don't need it no more and what does it do then Truth Versus facts and Truth overcomes [Applause] that's a discouraging saying when you go to a doctor and they show you a scan and say you know Mr Miss whoever you are that thing is is it's in your brain it's in your liver it's in your lung and what's the human reaction the natural human reaction for most people is to fear unsaints and loves to use the fact of fear the fact of trauma the fact of oh this one's in my family my grandfather had that my father had that oh oh goodness I guess I'm going to die with that well that may be the facts as far as the facts go but God may want to break that cycle with you just because your daddy died with it and your uncle died with it that don't mean God wants you to die with it he may want to break that cycle with you and say it stops right here Hallelujah can you imagine a man General Joshua he's given a commission by God to take the people of the Lord into their inheritance it's written and so it says rather than history that they're about 28 years covering the Span in order to take the land Joshua is getting old and he tells them there's still much more land to be possessed why were you awake come on in take the land but this is in the initial stage to where they're going up to the great city of Jericho it's in the Southland directly across the Jordan it's the first city they must take big gigantic walls able to have chariot races across the top of them uh to some historians say for the breast so you can imagine how big those walls would have been so and God gives him now the tactic or the means by which he's going to take this city now what he's going to do they're going to March around the city one time every day until the seventh day and when they're out there they can't talk they can't joke they can't laugh they can't say anything they just March around the wall and then they go back they come back the next day they March around the wall and they go back now would you ever believe marching and shouting will take down a wall that bit well now the fact says there's never been a wall before in history ever flattened down by marching and shouting praise the Lord this was totally again unscientific and now it was not even reasonable what person in the right mind could think they could March around the city then on the seventh day the priests will blow the horn down the Levi shall be carrying the word and then whenever they come around the seventh time because on the seventh day all seven seals are open Hallelujah so on the seventh day when all seven seals are open then they're not looking well this is not very scientific this has never been done before has anybody looked to see if we have any Scripture to back this up they had not one scripture they had not known not one previous record in the history of Israel or any other Nation where anybody had ever marched around that wall often let me tell you something people say oh well I'm just going to be another statistic well why would you want to be why would you want to just succumb to the devil and not fight for everything that belongs to you as a child of God hey but the truth is Joshua 6 20. so the people shouted when the priest blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people got real quiet and the people sat there and held their peace [Applause] and nodded their heads I saw a lot of us message folks do well we're not earth ain't we we nod off to sleep and we nod off to sleep and we nod off amen can you imagine brother Brandon whenever he'd send his old dog friends he said he hated a skunk but yeah brother Brandon would send old friends in on a skunk and you'll imagine that brother venomous said whenever you take them up there what skunk was and brother random would have went no Fritz to look back and said you mean that's all you got you mean you expect me to go in there and grab a hold of that guy he's going to make me smell like a pole cat ain't nobody want to be around me and that's all you got a little nod I'll tell you one thing some of you all ought to do better at home it ain't just enough to scream and holler to use Camp you ought to get behind your poor little Pastor when you go home don't just call her here but when you go home take that hollering back with you stand up and say come on man of God go ahead get that devil go ahead and get it well for the daughter he shall use him no but show your pastor once you've got it you can take your joy back home take your emotion back home with you Hallelujah so the people heard the trumpet the watch it's all synchronized together they hear the trumpet and they said so the people Thunder bad boy so we'll pick her off and what am I supposed to do the people shouted [Applause] us taking history and humiliating facts could have never been done before but it was gonna be done Hallelujah there has never been a universal Rapture but there's gonna be I thought he will be changed and the people shouted with a great shot that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city over the top of facts if you're going to wait for the facts to be changed you'll never be a Victorious young person but the odds are against me brother Donnie I agree they are the facts may be against you God's for you which one you're gonna believe which one you're going to believe y'all people you're going to believe the facts [Music] Hallelujah brother Tim I'll almost killed my wife and I some other believers was in Israel a few years ago we come down near this place where Joshua was fighting a battle and he needed some more Daylight now the facts are the Sun had never stood still before but that really didn't matter he needed it to Lord what do you need to not shoot what do you need Joshua didn't have one scripture he didn't look now look at another fact even Moses didn't death speak to the son of the Moon there had never been a man since the Lord God spoke him into existence that felt like he had the authority and the right speak to the Son and the Moon [Music] facts were against him but his need was so great he didn't care [Applause] no glory to God he didn't have one scripture he didn't have one quote reminds me of the little syrophoenician woman that come to Jesus a Greek a gentile she spent time and the Bible says it didn't even answer her a word she got after the disciples and they said Lord this woman is aggravating a far out of us it's Kentucky terms what would you send her away she's aggravating us like can you imagine you come to me or brother Ron or some of these other brothers your brother Tim and I said brother I need prayer I'll go on back and sit down young boy go on sit down you don't go sir I'm going home I'll find out here what a bunch of proud I'm pretty sure I'll never but what if Jesus is using that man to try your face you imagine this woman she didn't even have one scripture she didn't have one scripture that he would heal the Gentiles whenever he was here but her need was so great my daughter my daughter's grievously fetched with the devil I need your help in Jesus turn around and said listen to me woman you are a dog all right wow I'll tell you arrogant puffed up smart alec preacher come on there's two words used in the Greek language for dog one was big dog one was little dog Jesus used the one to the woman and said you're a big dog she come back and said no I ain't I'm a little though I'm even littler that you've made me the scriptures are astounding and brother Branham says this woman had so much faith even Jesus couldn't run her off [Applause] some of you can be run off by deeply run off by preacher run off because somebody didn't shake your hand Lord have mercy can your magic being such a believer that Jesus stands in your way and say you ain't coming you say yes I Am Lord yes I Am Lord I'll grab a hold to you like Jacob did the facts are against me but I've got a need I need healing I need Deliverance I need the Holy Ghost fox versus Jesus looks at this woman said some of you get so discouraged cause demons get in your way you get so discouraged cause the devil gets into a way well what if you ever meet Jesus and you say excuse me I said I said no you're not going to heaven well some of y'all look at me really funny look at Jacob and he got a hold of that man and said look I've got to be changed I'm sick of being who I am I'm sick of me I'll tell you that's a lot of our problem we're in love with me if we can ever get sick of ourselves and Jacob said I've got to be changed he said let me go I ain't letting you go I said let me go said I told you I ain't letting you because you imagine them wrestling back and forth back and forth and it's about the break of the day he touched him on his side oh oh he walked in a prowl arrogant message believer walked out like a kiss a limping Prince along with the gods I went to God Oliver Swift this meeting like living princess and like limping princesses but we've met God we've had an experience with God that's more than screaming more than shouting more than a motion that'll change us then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered a pair of Rights before the children of Israel and he said on the side of Israel sad stand thou tell upon gibeon and thou Moon hang don't you even dare move in the valley of Agilent and the Sun stood still now brother Donya there's no scientific uh uh so see you're still a fat person ain't you and you see if you use your reason against Joshua and against Moses and against Abraham and against all these others you tell me you're not going to use it for your own self when you by reason why I can't do it there's no way I failed and I've made so many mistakes y'all the devil knows there is great strengths in repeating your failures remember when David stood before Saul and David began to recall the previous victories that the Lord had done what did that do his own experiences with God enhanced and built his face and reignited thy faith of pulsation within his being and Satan learned from that principle so what will he do he will repeat our failures our mistakes our Circle all you tried it over and over again this preacher's praying for you thy preacher's prayed for me and that preacher's prayed for me I don't care if 975 000 has prayed for you don't change God's promise are you going to believe the truths or are you going to believe your past record of facts [Music] and the Sun Stood Still now I've never tried this on the sun myself or the Moon I have been deer hunting a few times and storms coming up and I climb up my tree stand Hallelujah it's time you go back that way then of course I get my raincoat my bow and my hair on my gun whatever go ahead and leave because after I say well don't sit there and look at me something y'all have done the same thing on your battles of life all you devil is sitting here you you leave me alone Lord of God I'm leaving this meat I'll tell you one thing I'm looking for that devil be careful now the cover that you don't leave her under the anointing of these preachers why anointed man of God can preach you to such an elevation in such a spot remember the prophet told us the same thing under the influence of those gifts those demons will leave you that ain't necessarily going to be when your battle is it's going to be when you get on the bus to go back home hoping you get on the plane to go back home that's when you're going to have to meet that devil face to face you may get delivered if you're smoking you may get delivered of your porn and don't mean that devil won't try to come back on you and you'll either look at truth or facts so the sun Stood Still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day wow Moses didn't even do this and there was no day like that before there after it that the Lord hearkens unto the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel so if he would have looked at facts it would say well Brothers maybe we should go on a seven day fast maybe we should pray a little bit maybe we should do this or that but he moved on the pulsation of the moment he felt like God he wanted to do something I'm so glad the man did aren't you there's no other place recorded in scripture or in history that this ever happened before or again but God had a man who took him at his word can I use another Gideon he certainly couldn't overcome an army with 300 men now the facts were Gideon was not a military man in the first place he had no experience as being a fighter or a leader of people as a matter of fact when the angel of the Lord come to him and he said oh I'll get him thou Mighty Man of Valor and get him would have said like we today who me you know my main Lord you got the wrong idiom there must be nothing getting around here somewhere I thought I was going to get in here in the field but apparently there's another Gideon somewhere because that is numb he said oh yes your heart oh yes your what was Gideon looking at facts facts under the hand of the enemy he hadn't done nothing for God under the hand of the enemy all will say his porn got a hold of him and his addiction's got a hold of him and he was just squandering around going to church in out in out up down up down but praise be to God the angel of the Lord saw something and Gideon that Gideon didn't see yet oh Hallelujah I pray that's what we're dealing with her tonight that the Lord sees something in all of us that we don't see yet yet we don't see it yet but we will see it is our time [Music] the midianite Army numbered 135 000. Warriors facts Gideon's not a military man the Army they're gonna meet has 135 thousand trained Warriors praise the Lord now natural man would seek to increase his army so Gideon starts out with 32 000. and God looks at him and said y'all got too many what what do you mean to me 32 000 it gets 135 God said yoga way too big okay Lord whatever you say I want you to get up and tell them everybody that's afraid go back to the house my goodness the first sermon my brother Gideon got up and preached 22 000 left his church you imagine after that sermon he thought about going into apology mode now brothers and sisters I'm so sorry I must have got so excited that day please forgive me for saying that no and God wasn't done yet now look everything that's happening the facts are stacking up against Gideon 32 000 facing 130 pounds bad enough now you're standing up there and you've got ten thousand and God looks and said you know what they're still too many yeah Lord are you sure I mean ten thousand it gets 135 000 people because now you're gonna wait too many tell her what you do I want you to take them down to the water I don't want you to let them start drinking yeah get inside okay right now don't say nothing to them don't make no announcements or nothing I'm gonna watch the way they drink so some of my boys come up there when they come up to the water some of them would lay down and someone would have done like this and they would have put their whole face their nose and all right down in the water and they're drinking now remember they are with insight of the enemy but over here was one over there's another there's another verse another they drunk like this God said that's my boys right there this other old boys throw caution to the wind the enemies all around them God says give me 300. I'll turn the world upside down with it Lord have mercy what can God do with this group of young people here tonight not only the young people but the rest of us in this place if we know how to drink right if we know how to approach it oh yes we know we've got an enemy and we know he's real but we also know greater is he that is in us that he's that is in the world so they get your hand down the water and laugh it like a dog you got your eyes open the whole time that motherhood boys just piled up her Oh Glory to God oh I'm so glad to be a Christian oh Hallelujah they're the first ones to head out of there whenever the battle gets tough so Pastor Gideon gets her princess good Lord have mercy I've only got 300 left in my church Lord what are you doing God says now let's fight well Lord do I do double time I mean you know simplify do I do I put him in the Marine Corps do I give them the double train what do I do do we want to jump do we lift weights what do we do I want you to take a picture in one hand and I want you to put a candle in the bottom of that I want you to take a trumpet and I want you to take a sword I want you to divide up into three pools it's going to be a hundred a second hundred and a third hundred and I want you to go down down the Lord said now tonight I'm gonna move among you you know why the Lord didn't want a whole bunch if there'd been a whole bunch of them that I said look what we've done look what we done boy I'll tell you what we fasted and we prayed over to God I'm telling you one thing now we got down on our knees and we beat that altar out go ahead of God we grabbed a hold of the horns of the altar God's looking for somebody to say I didn't grab a hold of the horns he grabbed a hold of my horns because I was mean [Applause] the truth is judge 7 22. and the 300 blew the trumpets and the Lord said every man's sword against his fellow I don't mind telling you I'd love for every battle to go this way you understand what they were they had The High Ground this is where they were they were on The High Ground and the enemy now they think the battle is over so they're on the long grounds and all these guys were up on The High Ground and they're divided a hundred another hundred another hundred and they're going to blow their trumpet and then they're going to break their pitch on when they do the whole mountain is going to illuminate with the light and they're going to look down and they'll say Lord have mercy we are surrounded we we done run they don't know but then but 300 of them up here 300 against 135 000. well how many share in this place tonight 350 400. oh you said my brother died all them demons out there never one of them demons are damned to Hell whoever one of them demons and their Destiny has already been spoken amen and when there is no more demons you will for everything but there is no more cancer when there is no more sickness you will forever do we are more than they are we are greater than

Spirits what causes war is the spirit of these nations get jealous of one another you see Satan founded his kingdom on Rebellion against God's word right can you imagine how it must be down in hell sometimes them Devils get so mad at one another they are so jealous of one another you imagine a little headache devil he don't rank very high all he can do is just kind of cause headaches to people

they'll say glory to God I wish every battle was like this I do too sometimes the Lord lets them go that way for the wrong other times you have to fight for every inch of the ground you're getting God but it's worth every inch so I want to be young people let's start this meeting will we believe facts if those facts speak against truths and facts are a portion of Truth or will we stand and say it makes no difference what my flesh is it makes no difference what the doctor says the Lord God is The Giver of my life [Applause] you know every now and then the devil will come talk to you and tell you this and that and the other you ever do you that way oh God don't love you God don't care for God with this and I told him about a week or so ago brother Ron come to be blabbed with his big fat mouths about something I said oh oh oh so when did you go to working for God [Music] you know what he done left me alone why he knew I had his number well he didn't stay away come back again the next day but I'll burn his height again left him like Hey if he's going to hang around me he's going to hear me talking tongues he hangs around me he's going to hear me praying he's going to hear me quoting the word he's going to hear me talking and confessing the good things about God so devil if you want to hang around come on come right on I'm going to preach to you I'm going to tell you you're going to hell I'm going to tell you there ain't no hope for you I'm going to tell you that I'm an overcomer and you are defeated why because I believe the truth the facts may be stacked up against you but the Lord is on your side this thing [Music] Samson couldn't kill a thousand for his teams well the Jawbone facts unreasonable to believe a bone is stronger than brass helmets and it's thick no historical record anyone ever fought with a child dog it hadn't been proven to be a good weapon or what we should send Alice up to this time but the truth is judges 15 15 and he found a new Jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand their wish oh that was the truth and Samson said with a Jawbone of an ass heaps upon heaps with a Jawbone of an ass have I Swain a thousand men and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking that he Cast Away the Jawbone out of his hand and he called that place Ramos Lehigh and he was sore thirst and called on the Lord and said thou was given this great Deliverance to the hand of thy servant thou shall I die for thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised but God claimed on Hollow Place that was in the jaw and water came there out and when he had drunk his spirit came again and he revived in other words he had a Revival out of what the very tool that God gave him to kill his enemy with
