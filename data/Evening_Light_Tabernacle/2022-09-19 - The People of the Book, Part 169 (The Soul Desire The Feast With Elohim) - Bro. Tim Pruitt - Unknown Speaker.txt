one lord jehovah god almighty all down to the old testament and then revealed in the new testament as jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever we cry out your name lord you're certainly worthy of our praise today and i pray oh god today that you'll just receive our worship and you'll just speak to hearts and lives and reveal yourself and anoint us lord may it be today that your holy spirit speaks that you speak through us as oracles of god to minister the word of life there are those lord that have needs among us today we pray that you'll just meet those needs lord bring healing our sister hollis that we've already prayed for lord oh god i i just ask in the name of jesus you'll just be her comfort today and give her strength lord oh god you promised you'd never leave us or forsake us so lord we pray god that even though that she may be up in the upper years you just be with her in this time and bring a healing for her body and to strengthen into her lord that's the way we want to live that's the way we want to be we want to be able to give our best for you and i pray lord that you'll bless your children lord ever need supply we ask bring healing and deliverance in your name in jesus name amen and amen god bless you i'm going to just have you turn to the bible this morning thank you genesis chapter 18. we'll read from the first verse and uh read down through about verse 8. so the lord appeared unto him speaking of abraham in the plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and low and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tenth door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my lord if now i have found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort you your hearts after that you shall pass on for therefore you come to your servant and they said so do as thou said and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal and knead it make cakes upon the heart and abraham ran into the herd and fetched um calf tender and good and gave it to the young men and he hastened to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and they stood by them under and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat amen god bless you can be seated i want to welcome each one of you today in the wonderful name of jesus christ and to say it's a privilege to be here and gather together with you today we also wanted to welcome a new couple and family in our church brother creed and sister abigail wheaton their daughters hannah and laura would you just stand so everybody know who you are and amen we want to welcome you they've come to sojourn among us god bless you amen amen and um pray that the lord will just bless you in every way and provide for you in every aspect of your life and and um so we're just happy that you've come to be with us put your shoulder to the wheel with us you know you you won't be an observer no more we're going to hand you a sword amen we get in the battle and we fight the good fight of faith oh my it's always good to be in the house of the lord and thanking god for all this goodness we saw um wednesday night a young brother come to the lord and surrender his life and many others down at the altar and we're thankful for the lord for that and he was a visitor from north carolina there a brother to brother manuel walker that um was also here and and uh they've been down doing a little bit of uh helping me a little bit on a little project that we have for the upcoming meetings to to host ministers and so on um now and in the future so it's um you know it's it was just a wonderful to see the lord just move upon a young man's heart and we can see that when you get in the presence of god lives are changed as he said i the young man told me he said i i don't believe in coincidence i do believe that the lord had this orchestrated but i never expected to get what i got amen so we thank the lord for what he did for us also we got um little jackson oglesby that wants to be baptized today in the name of the lord jesus christ and you know jackson is uh he's a special little guy not only special he's my grandson but you know he's uh been a really special little young man since he was born and has a real love for the lord and he may be young and a child yet but he um he really loves the lord and i i know grandma had him uh during the ohio camp meeting and they stayed up uh late and and watched the whole things and no he didn't sleep he got down on his knees and praying during the whole prayer line and all the way till about 12 1 in the morning so you know he just has a real sincere heart for god and so that's what we want to see is our young people come to know the lord jesus and i pray if you don't know him today you'll come to know him and to know him is to love him amen and to to serve him now this morning i'm going to be speaking on the soul desire the soul's desire we're speaking about the feast with elohim and um you know as we have been on this subject of abraham of course you know brother branham almost preached on abraham nearly every sermon that he preached he would at least mention if he didn't preach the whole sermon on abraham in his life because it's a prophecy of the last day and so um here we are finding that that elohim comes the almighty god comes and and he he visits abraham under the tree at mamrie and while he is there we have read where abraham feeds him under the tree and then we see in the last verse that he that he stood there given his full attention to to those as they were were feeding and eating and i thought about how important this is in our day and hour seem like whether it be advertisement or some movie or some uh thing out even a billboard along the side everybody and everything's wanting a part of your mind they're wanting to come somehow another implant a thought of influence within you and and so it's very important on what you feed upon and i thought you know as we followed up on the ohio camp and and the experiences that you had and the things that god did and i i just want to instruct you as a pastor about feeding your experience on the word of god and so we we have seen here that this is an appearing of christ um that he appears to abraham and it was christ it was before he took on the flesh of jesus but it was it was the spirit of god and the here he comes and takes on flesh 16 elements and steps down into a body that he has made and and when he does some he is hungry and he is is dusty from walking upon the earth and he needs his feet washed and and of course um abraham sees him and the first thing that he is set upon is showing him some hospitality giving him food and seeing to his comfort and welcoming and i just want to say that we have been in this appearing since the message came this is what we are in we are in the time of the lord's appearing but i want you to understand where that he's appearing in remember brother branham would tell us that that there would be a forerunner in this last day and that as john the baptist was sent to vorun the first coming of christ he was sent with a message to forerun the second coming of christ but in this he says the fourth second forerunner will do the same as the first forerunner but this time pointing to a word born bride so i want you to understand the coming of christ when we're looking for his coming we remember that he comes in in on word form to a prophet and a message is given to us and that is ordered to get a bride and for that to take on flesh and so then his the second aspect of his coming is a bride coming because it would be no use for him to come unless there was a people made ready and so the word is given to us to make us ready to prepare us to meet the bridegroom and i'll just tell you as a pastor i want you ready to meet the bridegroom and of course he says he he tells us here that um again an unveiling of god he gives us some more insight upon this and he talks about how god would descend and he would appear to moses and and um and then that would be god manifested a god in portion to moses and then and then finally the fullness of god would come after being manifested through all the prophets and the psalms and the songs of solomon and all of that that now it would be all manifest in jesus and jesus is the fullness of the godhead bodily amen so when he came there it was the same god but he was just changing his mask as it was and so um the only thing he changed his mask he never changed his word he never changed his nature so whether it's god in portion or god in in fullness he is always the same yesterday today and forever and he only changes his forms he would change from noah to moses and james foreign from moses to david from david to joseph until finally the fullness of all the prophets and all of the psalms and all of the songs of david all of these the wisdom of solomon everything become all encapsulated in jesus christ and so there jesus would be the fullness then of all the prophets of psalms the wisdom of solomon on down right into jesus christ now he's been doing the same thing since the beginning of the church ages but this time god has been taken on different kinds of veils he showed he would would come and develop the flesh of man on the day of pentecost now in the reformation he would come through luther and wesley it would be god again revealing himself and taking on a veil he would use his church to reveal himself through and then finally it comes out again to the complete or the fullness of the godhead all that was in luther and wesley the justification there the sanctification there the baptism of the holy ghost of the azusa street revival all of that would be encapsulated in a bride people in this last days it comes out into the complete but before it comes to complete a prophet rises again and he foreshadows that and he reveals what's been left off so the church won't be without understanding and then he fades off the scene for he says as john did i must decrease he must increase now where he's going to increase is in the bride of christ until the actual consummation where he comes in a physical form and we are caught up to meet him in the air now understand then then how he's going to be in his people in this last day it'll be the same jesus in bright form it'll be the same power the same church the same word all encapsulated in a body called the bride of christ and it'll be the word that was in luther in wesley and all of the portions of scripture that had been illuminated now come alive in a people in the last day and finally he comes right down to where as it was seed at the wheat a seed that was planted on the day of pentecost now comes to harvest time and it comes back seed again when you get the seed you can't go any further than the seed other than take it into the garner into the rapture all right so you see there there again he is he has moved as it was like from luther to wesley to pentecostal the the tongues and the lips and to the eyes of the prophetic of malachi 4 and but then finally there's nothing else left but for him to step into it now so that's the last thing there is where the body is complete and he steps into that body and that's what god is doing in this last day is stepping into a bright body now so he can use your flesh just as well as he could create something back there when he when he appeared to abraham remember he would gather the dust and he would step into a body and appear to abraham under the tree of mammary when he did he would he would eat he would be washed and man there would be dust upon his clothes it's somebody with me but now you see he doesn't have to do that anymore create a body like that he creates one by the baptism of the holy ghost by cleansing the people god comes and dwells in that body so you see we ought to say here today god used my dust come and dwell in amen come use my body let my body be the temple of the holy ghost to dwell in place of god so the angel of the lord is here that same pillar of fire jehovah god in your flesh and in my flesh amen now so the son of man which is christ is being revealed in bride body now i'm getting this down to you because i want you to understand we're not talking about so much an external appearing now where that under a tree here comes a man in flesh and and abraham calls him lord and he entertains him but i want you to see where that it's going to be entertained is not out here under a tree somewhere somewhere external but now god has come internal and where the entertainment's going to take place where he's got to be fed is the inward man now then we have brought it from out there to in here because he's using my dust so god dwells in you the bible said if you don't have the spirit of christ you're none of his so the spirit of jesus christ comes to dwell in you by the baptism of the holy ghost let me just go through some scripture here for ephesians 3 16 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened by with his might by his spirit in the inner man so where is the strengthening come food strengthens the individual the diet look straightened with but with might by his spirit where in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith so who's dwelling in you christ dwelling in you let's go again to ii corinthians 4 and 6 for god who hath commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in your hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure jesus christ in earth and vessels not that that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us so again he is the treasure in this earthen vessel and he should be treated with all and respect as a treasure so christ lives in us earth and vessels as a precious treasure revealing the glory of god to us from within so you see the difference between the old testament and the new testament they have an external religion but ours is an internal religion it's where god comes into the heart and dwells and the nature of god lives on the inside of you and when it does it has the same desires that god has now galatians chapter 1 and verse 15 for he said when he pleased god who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me by his grace and and to reveal his son in me notice where christ had to be revealed in here's where the revealing of christ takes place it's more than a doctrine it's more than a teaching or a book of creeds or dogmas of man it is absolutely the revealing of christ in you remember again as christ and you that's the hope of glory without christ in you there is no hope for you in glory amen now we might think this verse should read it pleased god to reveal his son to me but in the greek the original language this unmistakable a preposition there of ends so the verse reads to reveal his son in me here's where the revelation of christ has got to be is in you so god's plan is to reveal his son and us rather than to us because if it's just to us it's still an external religion it's it's law it's not grace when it's grace is something a work in the inward man now again galatians 2 20 it is no longer i who live but christ who lives in me so paul is very explicit christ is living on the inside of me and because he lives in us the christian life is not a matter of trying to behave like jesus but instead of allowing him to live in us and through us it's no longer you trying it's him living out of you now so so paul would say to the christ lives in me it's a marvelous statement of what it means to be a christian the almighty god can dwell within you reside within your soul so now think about how the bible puts this in revelation 3 20 and here's a verse to our age behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and i will do what i did with abraham i will shut with him and he with me so look laodicea the age has offered an appearing he's passing by i want to say he stands at your door and he knocks and says if you can hear my voice and you will open up the door i will come in and i will sup with you and you with me so this laodicea this age is offered the same visitation that abraham had amen i want you to get the stop now because this time he's coming to your tent he's passing by your tent he's coming to your door and you know if you can hear his voice my goodness there's every kind of noise out there today of every kind of voices that there is the voices of politics the voices of sin the voices of reason the voices of education the voices of men's ideas and religious views and everything but if you can hear my voice i'll come in and i'll sup with you and you with me remember i want to share this with you from the voice of the sign a sermon that he said his voice will speak one day a sign will come and what will it do the laodicean sign must be as it was then there will be a voice speak to us in the last day remember laodicea's sign jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and when he was put out of the church there in laodicea we find his put out again on the outside and look the voice says if any man will cooperate if anybody will let me in i'll come in and we'll suck with them and they with me i'll come in and i'll be in them standing on the outside of the rank of the churches knocking trying to get in remember i told you that as brother branham preached the sermon the laodicean church age he emphasized there jesus with dirty feet the unwelcome christ the unentertained christ remember the meanest man in santa maria or the meanest man in town is is not the prostitute trying to get to christ it is the pharisee the religious one who's sitting there in the pew and refusing to wash his feet [Applause] so he said come in if any man will open the door just like those on the road to emmaus come in and abide with us let's break bread together they had this stranger walking with them after the resurrection it was christ revealed to them the bible said in another form amen he is here but he's in a different form you know you're looking for the man walking down the the aisle today as the man with nail scarves that's not where he's that's not the way he's appearing he's appearing in his people amen right here in this church right here among you right here coming to your tent knocking at your door now you can be the greatest sinner in the city you don't need not to be religious to do that and turn him down refuse to wash his feet refuse to entertain him refuse to feed him we're going to have some real serious things here sup he says reveal myself to them i'll reveal that i'm the same yesterday today and forever so you see the sup he is going to reveal some things to you he's going to show you i'm alive i'm the same yesterday today and forever i'm not a dead god i'm a living god and i can give you power over the flesh and over the works of the devil i'll give you strength in your time of uh where you where you're falling short and you're unable i'll come and i'll be the strength giver on the inside of you now so you see jesus when he was here when he was departing he asked for one thing from the father if you'll read this in john chapter 17 he asked for one thing in his prayer to the father you know that but what that one thing was after he had given his sacrifice he had paid the price of redemption he had given his life he lived in the path he walked for you know he asked for one thing that where i am they may be awesome in other words he asks for your fellowship and this is what god is asking of every one of you today as a believer he is asking and designing one thing and that's fellowship remember this is a bride groom relationship a groom and a bride and as they as they are lovers together he's bringing her to himself and whispering the love secrets he's telling her about our future home he's telling about things that are to be he's telling about the rapture and how you're going to get to that home he's telling you about who is his melchizedek and your theophany all of these things he's whispering love secrets but you've got to be in love with him to be interested in what he's saying because he's not whispered this to his flirters you'll never get it just flirting around now so he asked in his prayer for your companionship forever then how much in return should we desire him like i tell like i told jeremiah the young man that came to the altar i said you know what did not come seeking god you might have thought you did but you weren't god was seeking you it was never adam in the garden after the sin saying god god where are you it was god saying adam adam where are you you see it is never man seeking god is god seeking you and dare to think about that the almighty god would seek you out that he wouldn't pass you by but he would come by your tent and knock at your door waiting for an invitation for you to invite him in and not just in but sup with him brother branham preached sermon's own door in the door and he said you get inside there's a lot more doors it's got to be open door of pride all kinds of doors you've got to let him in now so again paul would say in galatians 4 9 4 19 my children with whom i travail again at birth until christ is formed in you so look christ lives with us from the moment we're filled with the holy spirit but there's still there's got to be a growth within you see day by day we've got to give him the opportunity to grow and and to be formed in us and as we do christ will be able to express himself more more fully through our daily life brother branham would illustrate it like this he used this illustration he said like a button he said just like a little button when a man is saved that little much of him is god it's a like a little light that comes in you and you quit doing what is wrong now if you can take all the malice and envy and strife and unbelief how that little button like of light and the power of god will keep growing and growing and growing crowding out unbelief and you'll do it by sanctified by a sanctified consecrated life and not by exhortation of bodily exercise but the holy spirit moving through you so you see in every facet of life whether it's business whether it's study or whether it's war there is no safety but in advance amen to stand still is to go back to quit trying is to lose ground to slack in the pace before the finish line is to lose the race [Applause] but one sure sign and i want you to get this one sure sign of a christian a real true christian is a deep longing and a steady effort to know more of him i want you to think of it i told a young man who was he had found a girl that that he thought he liked and you know found that she was worldly and wasn't doing what was right and had was rebellious and so on and you know maybe found some undesirable things there and realized she needed the holy ghost she backed away now she's had an experience with god and he's gone again to seek and define maybe this might be someone i'd be interested in because has the holy ghost i said you know the baptist had their evidence of being filled with the holy ghost when i believed on the lord the pentecostals have their evidence of when they receive the holy ghost says i spoke in other tongues i said but you see we we of course must believe and we do believe in speaking in other tongues but what we're looking for is more than one thing and you young people when you're looking for us a mate you want to find the holy ghost and that person and you're looking for more than one thing well they shouted and they screamed down at the altar and they spoke in other tongues that's good well they believed on the lord and they believe the message and they they accept all the true doctrines that's good but you're looking not just for one or two things when we look at a tree and try to discern what it is we look at the bark it's got to have a certain kind of bark it's got to have a certain kind of leaves it's got to have a certain kind of fruit you can call it a peach tree all you want to but if it's got acres on it it's not a peach you see we are looking for more than one thing we're looking we're looking that's what you're looking for in your life you're looking for more than i came to the altar and i spoke in other tongues and i shouted or i screamed and i'll tell you i got i wept until the the altar was wet let me tell you i know from experience i can go back to my very early days in ministry in the old church where i'm talking about the old old church when i was about 18 19 years old and preaching there the young girl there came to the to there got into conviction came under the altar and went all over that altar up and down sorry for all of her sins only to go right back out into sin all over again never did come back to church never did go on with god you see repentance is a lot more than just saying i'm sorry repentance is turning from you can see a lot of crocodile tears sometimes even sincere tears a lot of them they're sincere because they got caught sincere because you know and they're crying and because of all the heartache and trouble that sin brings and sin brings heartache and people can cry over that and go right back into their sins what we want to see is change lives amen it's like brother branham said i don't care how much you jump i just what kind of life did you live after you jumped nothing wrong with the jumping nothing wrong with the shouting but go and live the right kind of life and that's because christ dwells in you now so you keep pressing on it's like he said in the messiah when a man is converted it's like a little white button starts in his heart and when he's born of the spirit of god that part is god that's god's spirit dwelling in him and if he can let it grow and take all the root out of the roots of bitterness and press god's way through him again he can come back in the same condition that he was in the garden of eden jesus said mark 11 24 verily verily i say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said that puts that puts him right back in supreme again it puts him right back in that condition so i'm just going to say i don't care how long you've been in the message i don't care how long you've been a christian there's still a place of growth in your life amen you should be leaving the things that are in the past and pressing toward the mark for the prize of the high calling never slacking back never a running back never a retreat as i preached sunday we've got to ascend ascension hill we've got to possess what others have failed to possess now ii corinthians 4 16 for which cause we faint not that though our outward man perish and you're going to get depressed worried fretful afraid sick weary of it all but the inward man is to have a renewing day by day so your inward man needs renewing that inward man is christ and he needs feeding and he's coming by and he's wanting to sup with you he's coming to abide in you and he must be entertained what am i trying to say you've got to entertain the christ that is in you now again you know many times people think glory that god you know i got so inoculated with the holy ghost there at the altar and i'll tell you the holy spirit moved all over me i danced i shouted i cried i spoke in heavenly languages i did all kinds of things i got the inoculation brother tim well you know brother branham believed in booster shots amen he believed in booster shot he said i'm so glad to be inoculated oh how the son of god took his own life and injected into my life injecting your life and he comes down and energizes with his presence you know when you get a serum every once in a while you get inoculated but you have to get a booster and what this city needs in the pentecostal church today is a booster hallelujah don't boost it on saying we'll make a few more organizations that'll ruin your prescription go right back and take a booster of the very same thing to come at the first place the same baptism by the same experience the same holy ghost amen glory to god forever and ever amen glory and power in the resurrection of christ he shouted and he said did the things that i do shall you do also because you're inoculated amen inoculated with resurrection power oh what a foretaste of glory divine amen i guess you think i'm noisy but it's just that way i guess you think you'd get noisy too inoculated branded so glad that i know where i belong in the house of god so not only do you need an inoculation you need your regular boosters and i'm asking you not as till biden of a vaccine that don't work but i'm talking about a vaccine that's a sin cure amen don't you realize you need a new booster of it today amen a fresh inoculation a fresh experience of freshness of the holy ghost in your life so you see it's like in the days of israel when he poured out the manna and he gave them food for for their weary bodies there it gave a manna bread from heaven that bread from heaven would actually tight christ and so think of it if it types christ that they would just gather enough as what was needed for the day right and if they let it just go over a day it would breed worms and stink is that right now god gives his children new bread every day his mercies are new every morning he gives you he wants you to have a word for the day every day so well i had a great experience last wednesday night oh no you should have had several more experiences since then because what you got wednesday night now has wiggletales and worms and stinks you've got to have a fresh experience today i know we don't like to hear that but it's the truth you look and see what happened to religion they just camped down at the same old thing and they are they looking here and said look luther gave us manna and what it is is wiggletails in it worms it stinks it don't save from sin it don't nourish the body amen well i'm presbyterian i'm baptist or you know i you know i'm pentecostal you know it's just a it's just old handmade loaf of bread and it's just this filthy and made up with the hands of man but when you can get the testimony fresh amen this morning in prayer the holy spirit baptized my soul freshly that's the kind of experience that children of god should have listen knowledge and nominational life where you have a wednesday experience and a sunday experience but every day is a walk with god now so you see it's it's angel's food fresh from heaven that's why christians should always read their bible amen for the holy spirit feeds on the word of god so if you're going to feed the inner man what are you going to feed him the word amen and so the food is the word of god i mean we're not going out here and killing the calf and dressing it okay make some unleavened bread sarah and come on we're gonna sit this down before you no we got to stand there watching the holy spirit within us be fed on the word of god [Applause] because christ lives on the word the holy spirit loves the word amen now brother branham would well i'm just going to use some of his for my examples because he was a godly man a righteous man a prophet of god and he says i really wish to read from the bible he said i just love reading the word the holy spirit feeds on the word jesus said it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and if you just take it each day not just as a routine but oh i'd say to make it that your heart craves for it see the soul's desire to step down each day and read so much of it you'd be surprised what it would do to your spiritual growth what reading my bible yes oh i wish i had the time i've got it right here before me of what really being able to take the word of god personally for you because i want you to understand it's a love letter it might have been written to generations about generations before but it is a personal word directly to you if you'll take it in the right mental attitude that this is for me this is the word of god to me and you'll take it literally for yourself are you with me so you take it just every day you know it's it's sheep food you know again there's all kinds of examples cheap food eagle food all kinds of a dove food you know again because god would liken his people to eagles to lambs to doves and every one of them have an appetite and they only eat certain things a real a real eagle there he's called a ripper with the beef he wants fresh food i'm not talking about these vulture types i'm talking about because vultures and eagles are two different things when you're a real eagle you want something that's living that's why we are typed as eagles in the bible especially in this age in the eagle age we have to have the fresh kill meat of the word and when we do you see it's a it's alive the heart is beating in it and when when the eagle rips on that carcass there the blood flows and it gets all over him he's called a ripper with the beat that's what the literal name for eagle is and he rips his food he doesn't eat what is dead and what is going by and what do others vulturize on of an aged past he's got to have fresh food for today and it's got to be alive it's got to have some power in it it's got to have flowing blood in it it can't stink because it's been left over from another age but it's the word of the hour the same way with the duh but has no gall so therefore it what does it do it eats only pure things the corn and the weed and the seeds and things like that you know you will not catch it on a carcass of an animal amen you won't find it on dead and rotten things its diet is pure and you're a dove your your diet has got to be pure a man a lamb he's not a pig a pig would eat anything but you see a dog a lamb he eats sheep food we're going to talk about that here in a minute but right now you see we're to feed the flock of god you know not with man-made theology but you feed them on the word because that's where sheep grow from you see you feed them the word and of course he said feed me to peter feed my sheep and feed my lambs because lambs and sheep eat two different things one of them is the young of the sheep and it it it it eats uh the milk of the word there's a necessity to not just preach and then minister do it a lot of times just preach way over the head of people you know we're way overhead of the lambs but you know when you're preaching you got to throw out a little lamb food too sure preach the deep mysteries and the deep things of god but get it where the young people can get it to and understand and walk out of here with something in their heart that it changed them somebody with me now now so in the in the bible we find that jesus was the hidden manner christ is the church's manner and that man in the old testament was what come down from heaven fresh every night and the new testament the bible speaks of hidden man so what is a hidden manner jesus christ is a hidden manner here in a little while the world will see me no more but you're going to see me i'm going to appear to you for i will be with you and i will be in you to the end of the world is that right so it's hidden manna and that's where every day comes a new blessing something new coming down from god a hidden manna coming from god out of heaven christ revealing himself on a daily basis not a denominational life of easter and sunday or just a wednesday on sunday or just to sunday just sunday or just as some do one sunday amen let me tell you something if you're finding yourself always missing church i would look for a spiritual problem well i i've been i've been sick a lot brother tim i i have this ache in pain ron spencer takes away every excuse you could ever have and where are you going to stand on a day like that i would check my appetite i would see why is it that my inner man is not requiring more have i dwarfed him has it become a is he is he somehow another you know where i really ain't putting the effort for us anymore i tell you what if you were if you're sick and i'm not talking about coming here with covered in flu and all kinds of junk like that were contagious but if you're if you've got a a chronic illness i'd come to the house of god and i'd come expect it that the healer is in the house and i was gonna leave out of here better than worse you see man shall live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god so brother bradley would tell you how can you stay home and be just as good a christian as you could be at church he said you can't do it read the word the holy spirit feeds on the word the bible is god's spiritual diet to his church and the holy spirit is the one who brings it to you and places it in the heart and with thanksgiving you water it [Music] and every divine promise will produce exactly what god said it would do that's why i would like you to read the word that is personally to you now you see what the devil wants to do he wants to separate you like a burning coal is burning bright take it out in the midst of the flames and it dies like a deer there you know where you know that like a deer you know he get a little deer out by itself that's the one the wolves work on there's a lesson if he can catch the deer away from the herd that's what the devil wants to do so you young lady he wants you to go out with a boy that's not a christian young man he wants you to go out with some little painted up jezebel you know he's somebody that's not a christian that's where he wants to carry at you he wants to catch you set a trap for you and you and now i'm coming down and this is the prophet's word to you old man or woman maybe you won't identify with that but you old man or woman when you separate yourself believers people say i can stay at home and be just as good a christian as i can at church you can't the bible said forsake not our siblings ourselves together that much more as we see the time approaching so if you're a christian you long to want to go where other christians are and fellowship with other christians you can't stay away from church and live the same life you can't do it so well i'm hungry and you never go to the table you've got to go feed on the word of god and fellowship with one another but when you get yourself singled out and away from the rest making yourself a little different won't associate with them because they believe this or want to associate with diet you're on dangerous ground keeping away from church find one of your choice remain there be a christian brother at all that's the way to be a real christian then we got fellowship protection people love you and pray for you and he said that's the success of my people my meetings is because people pray amen all that we get to have more success than even the night tabernacle because of people praying people calling on claude lord we need you to move we need to speak out of heaven today we need you to reveal yourself you see the holy spirit of the is the holy ghost in you it feeds on the word of god you see it actually takes control of your body and it brings your your body to church so that it can be fed on the word of god it craves the word and that the holy spirit is in you it feeds on the word it doesn't feed on television it doesn't feed on true story magazines and love books and you know the people calling yourself christians you wrap yourself up in you see though those things are influences i preached a sermon many years ago on the the influence from hell and i showed them out of hollywood where where the wave of sin was coming brother branham would call it in 1954 the invasion of the united states and he said it would start in hollywood and it was spread out to the nation and you look now where that people are of one mind you wonder how in one generation that you can change the mind of the masses where it's acceptable now for same-sex marriage where you can change the minds of people to think that young people young children can change from a boy to girl or girl to boy you wonder how it can be done it's been done with mass media from the vision of hell amen but god's in a vision in this day amen it's not a television it's a prophet who told discipline and that vision there was to transform you by the renewing of your mind to become a word bride a word people now so what are you feeding on you see a lot of things about jesus said we're looking for the whole man what are your desires what was your desires what was what was you before christ came in what what are you now what was your desires then what are your desires now you see this is what we're looking for we're looking for a nature well change shouted and run out i'm looking for nature change that's what god's looking for so you look at the magazines that you're reading and listen to what's brother bratton would use these terms himself in magazines and radio and ah you know of rock and roll and boogie woogie the music you listen to he said i can tell what kind of spirit you got anymore it is in magazines and newspapers are almost absolutely absolute obsolete i'll get it right in three times but it's it's about you know there you just about don't see a newspaper anymore don't read one it's it's all there on your phone or on your tablet or on your computer or whatever else but i wouldn't just say what are you feeding on you know you get some feeding on the news too much and you know what you'll do you'll get so so up angry of everything that is going on things that you can't even fix and that you really shouldn't worry about fixing because what we should be doing is preparing to leave here not preparing to stay here you see what are you feeding on what kind of music are you listening to you see what kind of what kind of music you see spirits travel on words those words will come in songs those words will come in things that you read it comes in the eye gate and it pollutes the soul and i'll tell you if you have the holy spirit in it'll grieve the holy spirit now let me just tell you i preached the sermon again many years ago i guess i'm going back in the memory something today but preached a sermon on divine in your energy and i talked about it when you pick up a book and you read a book there the words that you pick up from there energizes your spirit and when you when you read a book and energy is transferred to you it's something that your spirit feeds upon an electrician will study a book to become an electrician the books the doctors and nurses digest help them become doctors and nurses books on psychology transforms a regular person into a psychologist so even books on sex and violence positions the mind toward immorality [Applause] and what you're seeing you see is in television is books on steroids now i don't really need to preach about television so most of you don't have one you got rid of that years ago but you got youtube in this place and every kind of thing right there now if books do this one and can transform can transform a man a regular man into a doctor through his studies what can the bible do [Applause] it's divine energy it didn't come from the s-u-n it came from the s-o-n because all life comes from that sun and that energy can be transferred from you to you from the very words of god jesus said my word is spirit and my word is life so his words are spirit and when you read them they become spirit and when they become spirit is the quickening power to energize you to righteousness so if books do this what about video games that are turning youth into killing machines and i i i know the the video industry is in denial but other studies show that violent media concludes that violent video game exposure was linked to increased aggressive behaviors thoughts and emotions but it's a waste of a life i know i know young men that are there and men that have wasted their career because of addiction to video games i know of young people that have wasted their studies at a college because of an addiction to video games i know i know of marriage troubles that have come because of people being addicted to video games and when you get that addiction there it has got a purpose to transform you into something as a child of wrath rather than a son of god it is satan's design for this evil age to get into your mind to and therefore transform you into an angel of death instead of an angel of light studies show that children become numb to violence they imitate violence they show aggressive behavior they have emotional behavior and learning problems that can be influenced by these violent images sad to say there's too many of our young people that are watching those things the holy spirit doesn't feed on that you see the great man abraham lincoln has said he had two books and they influenced his life at an early age and one of them was the bible the other was pilgrim's progress and it molded a character so this is why we can say just let me go to your house see what kind of pictures you got on the wall go to your home your office what kind of music is playing look at what you read and you can tell pretty much about your inward man amen and because of that you see homes are not what they should be families are not what they should be a family altar is not it's not there where that family is called to prayer the bible should be read come on i'm talking about healthy families and i'll tell you young men if you start now and this becomes a pattern for your life that you set with your family you'll find a you'll have a godly family so today it ain't wait till i get married to start it it's right now you start your walk with god and begin to build a relationship with christ you see movies and music do the same thing as the violence rap music will make young people will make them move towards sex and violence and evil rock and roll has moved a whole generation toward rebellions because spirits move on songs and words the lyrics of those songs you see again you you can you can see what it has done it is shaped and molded to society until america is no longer a christian nation but she now takes on the very nature of the beast and it's because of what she has spread upon rap music will move children young people or anybody toward evil for lord for you say brother tim i i young man said to me brother tim i just love country music because it tells you about life the way it really is i said not my life not my life i meant tears in the beer and you know and and the wife has left me and the children you know we're left alone and you know we're you know all of the sorrows of life with country music remember i'd like to do is take that country music and play it backwards one time the man quits drinking starts working has a home has a marriage goes to church come on we keep playing that old country music backward we'll have some real christians same thing with your rock and roll and your rap you can turn it around and say i've got some different kinds of life the life that i now live is not after the flesh but if after christ the son of god he lives in me but look what has happened hollywood has pushed the gay agenda until it's now so common it's taught in our school it's forced upon little children that a boy can become a girl or a girl can become be a boy and it's because of the immorality that the world has fed upon until the whole thing is sodom and gomorrah look at the difference between how abraham treated the angel of god and sodom treated it the bible wanted to tell you it said that the sodomite said let us have those men that come to you that we will know them in other words that we can have sexual relation with them you see they had become so evil they would pervert angels we are here in a day and hour where satan and sin is so evil that it pervert pervert the very word of god i listened to a song the other day you know they don't know they don't know that jesus i know let me tell you the jesus that is being preached in the world today is a jesus that is a gucci washy wishy wishy washy jesus they don't care how you live he just loves everybody and he loves you in your sins and wants you just to come as you are and just stay that way that ain't the jesus of the bible amen that jesus in the bible planted a whip and drove them out of the temple and mount zara and he delivered the people [Applause] i mean you don't come to christ and remain in your sins you've got to be chains in his presence but you see god made two different covenants he made a covenant with two different plans he weighed one for the man he made one for the woman they're two different all together this is why the bible teaches a man should have short hair a woman in other words cut hair and and a woman should have uncut hair because they're under two different covenants this is why the bible is clear it's an abomination to god for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man he's not even seen not to even look like a man it also says that a man's not to put on a woman's garment amen they're all together different women and men were trying to women try to be like man and man becomes so specified he's like a woman amen even in the generations past uh brother branham spoke he said i saw a boy in cincinnati he looked like miss kennedy the hair was was out way like that he said god wants a man to look like a man and he wants a woman to look like a woman but he said the reason that they're doing it and this he said the jezebel system of the devil has got the whole world in corruption not a sound place at all it's all putrified swords swords of cancer malignancy of the devil that's eating the very core out of the systems that they got set up there satan is a vulture feeding upon his own kingdom he is the devil he is impure he is the father of a lie and he feeds on the flesh of his own people and it's something today when we see the struggle and young people pick up ever not just young people but a lot of others pick up every fad that comes along every fad that comes along that's why even in his generation the prophet of god would scream out against the duck tale the hairdos on the guys with the collars turned up because of the spirit that was going through the country writing on elvis's music when it was affired and identified with rock and roll i preached against goatees why because it's an identification of that music rock and roll you see you don't think brother branham recognized that yes he did he he stood right there and he preached about elvis lookalikes he preached about identifying yourself with the world and the facts that are going along is somebody with me amen you see where they they get where men will get so wound up in the cage of sin so they can't get out and yet they're hunting for something but the soul desire should desire god more than anything amen i'll just read this some identification brother adam went to the whole sermon of identified with christ i know today this is modern man even modern message people don't want to hear this kind of message but in identified with christ you see if we take men men you catch them on the street or in their business the old man wants to be a teenager he'll cut his hair off on the flat top and make a duck tail in the back he wants to be a teenager the teenager wants to be like one of these rock and roll kings where they wind up in sin and disgrace man seems to be unsatisfied he's running everywhere they'll listen to radio for jokes and things these jokesters pull they'll go out and try to mimic or act like those people take a little boy i know it he's like he's got to be polite nor hop along cassidy or the commercial world gets a hold of it makes millions of dollars out of it he goes on talks about it he said you know they take that as a standard of life as an example and little fellas run out become gangsters and robbers women turn to be prostitutes and street walkers and delinquent people men turn out to be gamblers and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god churches try to impersonate the other church the big church and what would just seem there's no satisfaction among people what makes them it's it's for a cause it's a nature god gives them a nature and they got a nature that makes them want to have something to identify themselves with they must have something they want to be like an objective in life they want to be a movie star a cowboy or something on that idea it's here on the radio coming home this little humorous here when when some great italian man at denver was trying to play a hop along cassidy with something with a loaded gun instead of that he's going to be a chester the rest of his life he shot his kneecap off there you are they're trying to something find something to identify themselves with and the reason they're doing is because there's something in them that god made of that but god made them an example to be identified with that and that was when he made jesus christ become your savior that's the example that's what people should want is to be identified with jesus to be like him amen you see you are to be a new creature in christ ii corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things become new you see people call themselves holy ghost field and you can see there's a buzzard living on the inside of them because it's still eating on the on the violence of the world the world still has an attraction to them you see you need the holy ghost in there and when the holy ghost comes in there then that soul desire has changed and you got an appetite for the things of god amen hallelujah you see you see again you you will realize you cannot love the world or the things of the world let me just go to this brother branham we'll talk about this in the message first preach a whole sermon on thirst which is so desire he said you neglect to read the bible believe the bible and the holy spirit to feed him on that you will die jesus said in john 4 3 man shall not live by bread alone but by every word not just part of it we take a little here little there he said i call that a bible hitchhiker hacker in other words somebody get on here but to get off there they believe this but won't believe that amen you got to take it all word by word man shall live by every word again if you neglect to feed the holy spirit the word of god jesus said every word shall be by the holy spirit and listen now if you try to feed it the wrong thing if it's a genie one holy spirit in you it'll know the difference and remember the word of god is what the holy spirit feeds on it don't feed on enthusiasm it don't feed on education it don't feed on church going it doesn't feed on theology there's a lot of difference between an inspired something or a theological standpoint and that's what we're trying to say friend we've transformed the message so many times in just a theological intellectual thinking without inspiration without the anointing amen until it's just a theology that's not the way the word is to come the word is to be spirit and light it is to be inspired anointed and with quicken and power to change a life amen oh my but you know we've had men like in the days of elisha so many of them that you know when eliza went to the school of the prophets and they want to entertain the prophet there was a lot of them that come in there and it's kind of gathering up some food and one went out together got a lot full of wild gourds thinking it was something good and it was poison there was death in the pot there's been a lot of things that has gone on in the message that has brought some death in the pot am i contaminated with one idea another idea one of the one of the biggest contamination is a baptist idea i'll just believe the message and you got the holy ghost that is a wild gourd it's death in the pond it'll kill our young people amen we've got to have the power of god amen now jesus when he was here they tried to feed him something one day he said well i've got some meat that you don't know know about they said well did somebody feed you you know somebody brought him something to eat he said my will my meat what gives me strength what my diet is is to do the will of the father of him that sent me and to finish his work if there ever was a thing we should be doing in this hour we should be consecrated on one day finishing the work we are the finishers we're the last writers in the race we've got to put everything we've got into it and our strength will come by doing the will of the father and the will of the father is the word of the father amen it should be our zeal it should be our burden amen why your capacity for the words that have no limits for those needing adoption one thing brother branham said about them he said they fill up real quick they're like a little bottle they've got a little bitty capacity for the word of god so they want a 15 20 minute sermon brother duplicity said to brother branham one time said brother branham um or he he was he was saying because the service went long he said i suppose i kept those people too long he said brother brown i think the people feel like god do we're here we're tired of hearing sermonettes by preacherettes to christianites i know even in my tabernacle don't doubt sermon sermonettes by preacherettes to christianettes amen no we we want real word of god things that have changed and transform a life something that they give you an absolute that when the storms are coming you know that you know that you know who you are and where god has placed you in this house amen he said my used to our services why we didn't even get started good until one o'clock in the morning and of course that was the evening service and he said today he said a 20-minute sermon's all they want and he said i like to mince and eat he said i like to sit in the table he called it mention and eating you know take a look you know we had a years ago my wife and i were newly married and of course you know we had hosted ministers that came and and uh i had this minister that's at the table and he looked over what we have what we got well she made chicken and dressing i don't like chicken and dressing well i said sorry that's what we got so you know he started eating got some he kept eating got him some more and kelly i said i thought you didn't like chicken and dressing well i like this this is really good i said you want some more he said no i'm just getting a little more of this so i can finish up you know how it is sometimes you know you got a plate full but you just need something of that other little dish there to bring it back and kind of you know to finish that gotta finish the meal but you want everything there got a certain taste certain flavors are trying that's what brother brandon said i like to mince and eat and mince and eat you know just take of it sit at the table and he said you know i like to stay a long time he said i i saw brother neville the other day preached about 45 minutes and saw him look at the clock and said yeah brother neville you're getting it also 45 minutes that's not long enough to get started he's just getting interested i'm just getting stirred up to a place i was feeling pretty good and he cut it off what a shame amen not but you see the holy spirit it takes the word of god to feed the hungry soul and eating accompanies fellowship so the holy spirit likes to eat and fellowship with the believer amen so we're all gathered around the great table and i want you to know god has provided so much for this age amen you've got an abundance to eat you don't just have luther's justification or wesley sanctification or acts 2 4 of azusa street you've got the whole menu the seven course menu the seven seals are open the mysteries are revealed the the seals are taken off the book and the entire word of god is available to you can you imagine you don't ever have to run out of anything to preach amen there's always a bunch more i know you thought i would have been just even a month ago been through with this on abraham and here here i am right here why it don't run out it man it doesn't run out there's always more they've been god revealing of the bounties of his blessing that seven courts menu now as we're thinking about this sometimes you wonder and i want you young people to think of this because you want to ask sometimes how can a christian get deeper in the love of god how what can i do brother tim here's the answer read the word and pray what that simple that hard amen read the word and pray you see in our day in our age satan's got your time taken up he's got your mind filled with every kind of thing and so as i said it's easy it's very simple read the word and pray this is a question ask brother brown how can i get deep in love with god read the word and pray he says it twice for emphasis just that simple but that hard because you're going to have to will to do the will of god now he says how many reads the word daily and i'm not going to ask for your hands because too many christians have never even read their bible just start in right in and make a habit of reading a chapter every night and before you go to bed in a chapter every morning just as you get up it don't take no time until you know the holy spirit feeds on the word of god is good for you to read and then he said people just simply read it join church and let it go at that they don't sit down and read the holy spirit feeds on the word of god jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god so when you get saved the best thing to do is sit down with your bible and constantly read it that builds you you see what god did it's not like reading some novel you're reading so you can hang your soul on every punctuation of it because it's the word of god and every time god says anything you know how i punched him that weighed it with an amen that's right that's right so how that's how we should punctuate all of god's word with the name man when god says thou shalt and thou shalt not and so forth you say man not say well i would this way ought to be this way but just say amen to it and water it with praise and when the word is preached from the pulpit do like rebecca did she watered the camels the camels represented the power the beast represented the power and then she watered with praise the camels that was going to take her to her bridegroom so when you're in the house of god what are you to do you're going to say amen to the word you're to rejoice in truth amen you you got to water it with thanksgiving as the holy spirit goes out breaks across the crowd and there is it moves there you move with it and you water it there's a lot we can say on that but i'm running out of time and there's some things that i still want to get to and i say in our service today remember a lot of this i'm doing because as a shepherd i am to watch for your souls because i must give an account and i must give an account to preach to you the whole counsel of god so we don't want to just feed you an educational program and you know i teach you the dudes and the don'ts you know we we want to we want to have the the preaching of the gospel of the power the resurrection of jesus christ so as we're looking at this as we're talking about this we want to just realize that even in our service you know realize what you're feeding on realize it's the word of god and then you're to water it you respond to it you are to give your attention to it you are to have the hallelujahs and the amens and raising your hands and and clapping your hands and worshiping you're not applausing a man you're applausing the word of god you're saying it's right hey man i don't want your applause i want you to plunge him and his word you know you're feeding on the world it's not some dead carrying that come from ages passes right here is the fresh matter of the word of god amen what what do you think though brother brad i'm talking about mossback christians because christians get so long in the waters they turn green they sit so still so there so long until they're really not in it really anymore they're just growing moss i don't see you getting moss on your backs i want to see it alive in your life the holy spirit moving within you i want to see it pour out his spirit on all flesh come on somebody i'm a woman well upon my sons and on my daughters i'll pour out my spirit amen i want to see where our thoughts are on until their spiritual dreams again until military young men see visions old men drink dreams about whether god is speaking in his word and the flowing of the holy spirit through the church the gifts of the spirit working in in the body but i wonder how many christians are living a denominational life they just come to church regularly but through the week they're filling up on movies video games facebook junk youtuber makes it available where you can gum your soul up with every kind of nonsense i went to adopters i went to a doctor's office this past week and two employees were were talking about how tired they were they'd stayed up late watching a movie so it was supposed to be based on a true story but it was terrible and it was awful but i've watched it and i can't i can't already get my eyes open this morning can't hardly do my work i was way up and uh way up late i i i wanted to say just because it was a true story don't mean it's fit to watch well it's a true story that don't mean it's something you ought to be feeding on looking at it really happened to sowing so well as a soil so it might have but that shouldn't be what you're feeding on amen now you're to be married to christ can you imagine at nighttime and i'm trying to bring this down to close and i will here in a few but i'm going to mince and eat just a little more amen you're a farmer you're a mechanic preacher whatever you are you come into your little home you're longing to get there you open your door and your sweet little wife greets you and she's all prettied up and cleaned up walks over kisses you and cheek said dad you're tired sets you down in a chair sets online on your lap puts your arms around you and pets you seems like you're not tired it just picks you up it's something that god gave you for a purpose it's a part of you it's a true wife but what if those lips have kissed another man that day or some other time what if you're conscious of that what if them arms was has hugged another man she'd be an abomination on your lap that kiss would burn like a judas kiss those arms you'd rather they wouldn't be around you she might be all prettied up her hair curly her eyes may be pretty eyes and her cheeks rosy her skirts iron be so pretty but if that real genuine godly love and respect and confidence isn't there she'd be better off staying off your lap you don't want nothing to do with her she's an endeavor no matter how pretty she makes herself she's still wrong until she's proven to be a genuine real sweetheart loving nobody else but you no other kiss from her lips but yours no other arms that has held her but yours and you know it what a feeling what a consolation you see that's a husband and wife which is the type of the church when you go to church you can have the best views there is in the city you can have the best organs and best music you might dress the best you might sing like mockingbirds but if you're kissing and flirting with the world that kiss on the cheeks of christ is a judatarian kiss he looks upon you and he sees the wedding ring is gone the tablet is missing divine's love is gone it's just a form finds loyalty is gone you've committed fornications with the world you're watching things you shouldn't watch participating and feeding on things you should never be feeding them watching dirty television programs and brother branham would call that 1957 dirty television programs and he said you're committing adultery against the god of heaven brother tim we don't do none but just watch reruns ah it's just harmless now you know this is baby stuff brother tim committing adultery against the god of heaven you're either believing to be a prophet or you don't you either believe he was a spiritual man or he wasn't you could say well my opinion you can just go ahead and exalt your opinion all that you want to but he said you're committing adultery and the coming of the lord is at hand if you were in danger then you're in danger now but he's knocking laodicea don't want him he's put out of his own church like david they anointed one by god but refused by the people they'd rather have a soul instead a man to rule over them i'm going to close with this this is found from the song of solomon and i'm using a different a little bit different translation for easy reading so i won't refer to the chapter and verses but if you go and read uh the song of solomon five it tells about how that you know the the the the bridegroom the husband comes home and and he's knocking he's wanting him and she says listen my beloved is knocking she recognizes it it's the lord knocking remember laodicea this age i stand at the door and i knock and he is saying open to me open to me my sister my darling my dub my flawless ones he gives all these names these sweet names is standing at her door and and he's calling for his maiden but but the sound of the voice was not enough to persuade her to open she just kept laying there she hears his voice but she don't make a move she recognizes it's him but she just keeps laying in bed the appeal of his presence simply knowing he solder out and if you just think about it you didn't see god god sought you and here he sought you out and at your door that should have been enough to persuade this this wife this maiden to go open the door just hearing his voice the voice of a beloved the sound of his call should have been enough to get her to rise and jesus said you heard it if any man will hear my voice there's been the voice of god in this last day you have the bible you've got genesis to revelation but you've also got the message to the laodicean from the seventh church age messenger and there's so much for you to feed them if you will hear the voice open the door listen to me open for me that should have been enough for him for her to open the door and then he praises his maiden you know with all of these really warm and soft complimentary turn the terms you know open to me my sister my darling my dove my flawless one amen and so he he gives a an appeal of tender names he's calling her my beloved i chose you before the foundation of the world i knew you before that you were ever born and i called you to be a bride in the end time all of these things that he speaks of you know you're blameless and you're sinless and you've been lost and you're my undefiled you're my you're my love of my life and you're standing at the door and he's knocking amen and yet with all of the things that he said it didn't get her to open the door and then he uses another persuasion my head is drenched with jew my hair with the dampness and the night i'm uncomfortable i'm standing out here in the cold i'm damp with the dew of the night i went to calgary for you paid the price of redemption i've given my all to you open the door but with all of this you'd think that would warm her heart it didn't she didn't open the door for the beloved and let him in in fact to the matter is with everything that he's done his voice his compliments his his speaking of his own discomfort my hair is wet my my back i i'm filled with the dew of the night i've been out i've been toiling for you i've done all of this for you open the door for me let me in now listen this is not a stranger this is the husband coming home and here as it is she only makes excuses she's comfortable in her bed she's at ease in zion so he can't come in she can't be bothered with the inconvenience of dressing herself preparing herself for sleep again she said i've washed my feet how can i defile them i've taken off my robe once i put it on again i've washed my feet do i need to soil them again she's not willing to be inconvenienced now i told you already reading your bible and praying making a time morning and night for this word of god but how many don't want to be inconvenient she did not appreciate maybe the unexpected visit i don't know maybe come in a lot later than she had expected of him and she was annoyed maybe it was her effort just to control the relationship i'll let you have as much of of me as i want to i'm not giving my whole self why should i run as soon as he knocks i can i he can wait a little while this can wait whatever the specific reason she refused just to promptly rise and open the door and the bible said that because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold the bible tells you about losing your first love i want you to think about it her problem though you know was not that she didn't go to the door she eventually she did but she went slowly and reluctantly she was making excuses all the way her attitude showed an insistent spirit you know she was thinking about her comfort and not at all about the bridegroom's desires the soul desire now maybe the girl felt resentment toward the bridegroom perhaps he had delayed his coming the bible tells us this will be a part of the end time process men will say the lord has delayed his coming so with part of his coming is a delay and in that delay people get weary slothful lazy sleepy the girl maybe felt resentment towards her bridegroom he delayed his coming she's not more interested in her sleep her needs her comfort rather than his needs and his comfort it reminds me of how we have become more interested in terran until he comes instead of his coming we started out with the emphasis being on his coming but we are winding up with being more interested in the terrying process of waiting of doing this and doing that and living life just like it's gonna go on for another thousand years it won't this is laodicea the last age look all around you the end time is everywhere my beloved has put his hand by the latch of the door he's rattling the lights he's trying to get her attention trying to wake her up come open to me the maiden could hear the beloved put his hand on the lights and the mechanism of the door is a clear and final indication of his desire to enter and to be with her but was only going to be at her invitation i want you to get this he would not break the door down he would not bust the lights it can only be at her invitation god is waiting on you like abraham to run to meet him to stand by him unto the tree to see to his every need [Music] i hope you get it he insisted she open it not him force it the husband refused to force himself upon his maiden and will only enter at her invitation he will not break down that door finally she rises and she says i arose and i to open for my beloved she had delayed a long time delayed out of self-interest self-indulgence maybe connect something connected with her resentment of it didn't happen when i thought or i've been disappointed along the way or and he she finally gets up and she goes to the door and when she does she feels there on the door handle her hands dip with myrrh and she noticed the latch of the doors been anointed with a sweet perfume he had left her a love note and then went away left her a love note just the smell of him was all that was left and she looks for him and she can't find him you see there will come a day when men will look for god and never find him that's why jesus said seek you seek me while you may amen you know right now today is the day of salvation you never put it off you never put god off you don't push him out of your life you put him first place i rose to open for my beloved my hands dripped and with my my fingers were flowing with myrrh on the handles of the boat bolt i opened for my beloved but my beloved head left he was gone and my heart sank at his departure i looked for him i didn't find him i called for him and he didn't answer all you need to know is bible god said himself to those that he calls he said there'll come a time i'll call i won't call anymore you'll call and i won't answer i called but he gave me no answer now the rules are reversed first it was him calling she wouldn't answer now it's her calling he won't answer she had foolishly waited too long want you to get the start now then she goes out in the streets wandering in the night seeking for her lover when she should have been in the safety of her own home and in the arms of her beloved and under his protection but instead he is outside of his own church laodicea i stand at the door knock and the watchmen find her and the watchmen of the city found me and struck me and they wounded me and the and and and you know there again she didn't find her her beloved neither did she find help from the watchmen and the keepers of the wall actually took her veil away from her not only was she unsuccessful in finding but those they you know didn't that that did find her they didn't sympathize with her enough and she felt they mistreated her and i really wonder when i when i review the scripture if because of her guilt and her shame and her neglect of turning him away and letting him stand outside drenched with drew with do and thinking only of her own comfort now she don't interpret the correction of the watchman as a beating many look at the message now and the messenger has been too harsh too hard too judgmental too unloving too unsymptomed sympathetic and here she corrected by the watchmen she feels wounded by them the watchmen say why did you do this how could you have turned him away your laziness after god is your crying sin and this perceives treatment by the watchmen reflects the girl's guilt and the sense of failure at the slowness of the response to your husband and is in correction by the ministry because of your failure to worship him not for not dressing with holiness to please him listening to his voice watson have a responsibility and sometimes you feel like i walk out of church and i got a real beauty listen you should have never quit listening to his voice you should never be wandering out there dressed the way you are looking the way you are acting the way you are or coming to church and refusing to worship him then you get angry and all the watchmen beat me he beat me he said something about because i wouldn't respond he beat me he beat me listen it's our responsibility we're watchmen send the girl back to the house get back there in your position he's going to come again and when he comes again this time don't turn him away open up the door for him fellowship with him and he with you see it's a reflection of your own guilt and the sense of failure and your neglect of the bridegroom by letting him stand out drenched with dew begging to come in now listen the greater the dignity of the person offended the greater is the offense let me say that again so you can wrap your minds around it the greater the dignity of the person offended the greater is the offense if i would hit one of my brothers they're all adults and i would hit them in anger not joking but in anger it would be a great offense if i were to hit my daddy it would be even greater it would be a greater offense if i hit a police officer greater still if an anger i would hit the president could you imagine get an audience with with mr biden and slap him that would be a great offense you know the world's got in england a new king to hit the king would be a great offense to it king solomon would have been a great offense but the greatest offense if i was to hit an anger the lord of glory jesus christ and in his death people turn a blind eye and spit on him and similar to how the bride so to speak turned her nose up at her beloved knocking at the door and didn't open his voice see how the offense gets greater depending on the dignity and the worthiness and the regard of the person brother father police officer president solomon king of kings to the king of kings the lord of lord jesus christ and all sin is evil yet sin against our great god is the greatest of evils to turn him away when he's knocking is the worst offensible sin no wonder the watchmen beat her no wonder they sent her home get back to your position look what your slothmates has done look what you're in serious and serious kind done and the maiden goes and says daughters of jerusalem now she regrets it she's suffering because of her previous action her her slothfulness she's she says if you find him tell him i'm love sick now she's loved sick but not all in the sense you know that she was and like the earlier solomon uh the chapters of the song of solomon chapter two but priests previously she was overwhelmed by his love but here she was aching at his absence oh he's gone you see in our spiritual life there are some sicknesses that we get sin sickness when the soul hates sin and wants nothing to do with it self-sickness when the soul comes to hate self-indulgence and self-seeking and self-exalting and self-reliance on every sort love sickness of the first type when the believers so deeply moved by the love of god that they can hardly bear it for themselves see she become lovesick this is what i want you to do get so love sick that you're sick of sin so love so love sick with god until you're sick of your own self and your selfishness and your pride love's sick until when he's missing from your life when you don't hear him you feel distance and even deserted and you long for renewal of closeness the bible said as the as the deer pantheth for the water brook so thirsteth my soul after the o god i want you to bow your heads with me his musicians come and i want you to look at your own life he knocks or you open it he comes down he's calling you all kinds of wonderful names my bride my chosen my elect my people my sons my daughters he gives you all these enduring endearing terms trying to get you to open he speaks over and over and over again his voice the voice of god in this last day ought to bring you to a new level of sincerity dedication consecration and i'm asking you look at yourself are you really feeding the inner man on the right things what about it are you slow to respond to him sitting in a service or are you do you just let it pass you by and oh i've heard all this kind of things before go ahead and give me the key of e flat you know what i want to play [Music] what about you [Music] he knocks are you making excuses you remember there there was an invitation to come to a wedding in the bible once said well i bought a i bought a uh land and i got to go and see it another i bought a yoke of oxen i've got to go do this it wasn't bad things buy a yoke of oxen i married a wife all these excuses that they gave not to come to the wedding supper that wasn't bad things it wouldn't be a bad people but it was bad to turn down his invitation there was nothing more important than him [Music] i wondered today do you really realize who you're pushing out of your life the greater the dignity of the person the greater offense to think that god would come and knock at your door to give you an opportunity say i want to deliver you i want to bring you into a new relationship [Music] i want more than just make a denominational christian out of you i want to make a real son of god out of you [Music] i want you i want to wash you and make it clean where i can say you're my undefiled you're my dove you're my chosen you're my love you're i'm taking you to heaven with me [Music] can you let him stay outside one more moment why be reluctant to let him in [Music] what about your daily life are you letting him in there what about your prayer life are you letting him in there what about your bible reading are you letting him in there [Music] oh you've won all the video games but have you ever

with a sinner today that you don't know jesus maybe you're a backslider and you've been away from him but i just start right there he knocks if you feel just at least a little bit of knock a little tug in your heart once you move toward him maybe that move could just be this little hand lifted up start right there just say lord i need you don't pass me by i want to open the door for you i want you in my life god sees your hand would there be another right there god sees you too he hears a humble heart crying he wants to come in your life he wants to make something real out of you take something make you a genuine holy spirit-filled christian but there'd be one more to just lift a hand to god and say i need you new jesus to be anybody else that would be here in the service today and

[Music] is [Music] [Applause] so much [Music] is [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] amen praise the lord that's the truth we want to see him and to look upon his face and you know we want to be there in that number and uh we want to to go we want our children to go with us and of course you know we're here to obey the lord and and all that he said and all that he said for us to do the bible said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be condemned it also says and peter said it this way he said that as as as noah there was uh the the world was baptized with water he said so are we to be baptized and he goes on to explain that baptism doth now save us not in putting away the filth of the flesh but in the answer of a good conscience toward god so we're here today part of salvation is calling on the name of the lord and as he told uh saul on the road to damascus when he was struck down by the bill of fire and he said who art thou lord he said i am jesus and so then he was instructed to go and and to ananias and his eyes would be open and he was to be baptized calling on the name of the lord and the name of the lord had just been revealed to him as jesus so all that we do in word or deed we are to do in the name of the lord jesus christ and this is the commission that god gave us all through the bible no one was ever baptized in any other way than in the name of jesus christ it is the name above all names that at the name of jesus every knee has to bow and every tongue confess that he is lord so we're taken on the name of our lord and just as a wife takes on the name of her husband so does the church a type of the wife is to take on the name of her husband jesus christ all of these things are true when a son is born into a family our child is born in the family takes his father's name we are taking on the name of the one we are born from when we're born again we receive of that name so we're coming bringing jackson here today as i explained to you he's a young man but he's given his heart to the lord and he sincerely wants to serve the lord so today we are going to take and baptize him in the name of the lord jesus so jackson the lord jesus sent me into the world to preach the gospel now he commissioned his disciples in matthew 28 19 to go into all the world and to preach the gospel baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost in obedience to that divine command i baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ thank you lord hallelujah praise the name of the lord hallelujah amen god bless you today you know our meetings are coming up very shortly and i'm looking for a wonderful time of the lord you can expect this place to be filled up there's probably more than ever that i've heard that's coming and so we're gonna have quite a quite a bit here among us and we're looking forward to that a lot of expectation and things that are and especially in the time in the world that
