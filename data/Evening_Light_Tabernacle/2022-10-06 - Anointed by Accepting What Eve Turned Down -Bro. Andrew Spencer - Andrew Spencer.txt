Lord Jesus you have gathered these bones Lord Jesus from the East and the West Lord Jesus and you've come to inspire them Father by the preaching of the word Lord I would ask Lord that you would just come Lord Jesus and you'd meet every single one of their needs Lord Jesus Lord I know that that we as Humanity we we can never do anything in our own except for get out of the way Lord but I I remember that a prophet said that you take humanity and redeem Humanity father and Lord I would ask Lord that you would allow the Holy Spirit to come and take control of every vessel here tonight I

back and we've certainly looked under these meetings for for quite some time and been under great anticipation and here we are and we're just looking unto the Lord because we know that he has a great big plan a great big plan that is before us and we certainly appreciate brother Tim and and the church for the invitation to come and to be a part of these meetings and uh and uh it's a real honor to be speaking with brother Wayne and my one of my best friends in life brother Ron and uh if you if you've not seen a miracle lately just take a look behind us I don't know what else you could ask for tonight Lord to to raise your faith but to see a man that I've seen day in and day out struggle to to live and to fight it it gives you a tenacity to believe that all things are possible to them that believe and I believe that the Lord is here to display his power and His Majesty like never before and we're under great anticipation amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening would like to look over in the Book of John John chapter 1 verse 11 then to Luke chapter 4 certainly honored to have my wife and my children here with us this weekend and his little children know how to calm daddy right on down and maybe sometimes stir them up a little bit too so but they certainly are special they certainly are special to us amen I'd like to speak to you on the thought that the lord has laid on our heart for this meeting open this meeting up on anointed by accepting what Eve turned down anointed by accepting what Eve turned down John chapter 1 and verse 1 he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave you power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and of Truth and flipped down to verse 40 there and one of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother he first findeth his own brother Simon and saith unto him we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ and he brought him to Jesus and when he and when Jesus beheld him he said Thou Art Simon the son of Jonah thou shall be called cephas which is by interpretation a stone Luke chapter 4 and verse 18. Luke chapter 4 and verse 18. the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of the sight to the Blind and to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eye is of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord I think it's amazing I think it's an amazing thing as we're reading here and we look back two thousand years ago that Jesus comes and he takes the he takes the scroll and he begins to read over as we would identify it as Isaiah chapter 61 and he begins to read that portion of scripture as the book was delivered to him and the Bible said that he closed the book and sat down but today we recognize that we're living in an hour that he's opened the book and he has said that this day is a scripture fulfilled and today we recognize that we are the Most Blessed people beyond beyond our own human compensation to be able to to understand exactly how blessed that we are to think that we're sitting right here in the greatest anointing that's ever struck the land or struck the people of God and here we are we're we're watching the the more the mighty move of God as it's moving through his people as he's as he's drawing a body together you're watching the anointing of the Lord as he's beginning to move through the message of the hour of Malachi 4 and he begins to move across the Living God and the Church of the Living God and he begins to draw them unto himself and and we recognize that that that they're accepting it means to the consent to receive it's to receive willingly it's to give an affirmative answer to offer or proposal or to say yes to and when when you watch as a young couple as they're as they're working or they're walking down the aisle and they're standing there and they're they're making their proposal and they're making their they're making their vows to one another and they they declare that I will go with you I will be with you your people will be my people your God will be my God and they say I I do at the very end when the when the preacher's standing there and he's asking you see what is he doing he's asking this man will she accept this except this man to be her woman or the wife to be the man or wife to be the husband and vice versa she's standing there and she is accepting him as her head and when that when that wife is standing there she is accepting him as her headship and this body in this generation has allowed the Lord Jesus Christ to be her headship she's not allowed Rome to be her headships she's not allowed the church World she's not she's not allowed anybody but our Lord Jesus Christ to be her headship and you go to studying out over in Jewish Traditions when you go to studying out when they have a wedding ceremony there in the Eastern countries that there as the as the groom and the bride are standing before one another that they're standing there and she's got the veil over her face and she lifts the bridegroom lifts the veil and he places it upon his shoulder showing that he is taking complete ownership of her and our Lord Jesus Christ has come in this generation and he's took in complete control of this body and there's not one thing out of place in the body of Jesus Christ this is not a Bejeweled corpse this is this is not a freak body but this is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ that is an anointed by the same anointing that was there two thousand years ago it is the same anointing that was on it was on Moses it's the same anointing that was there on Jonah it's the same anointing that is here in this building tonight is the same one that was back there in the very beginning that rode the worlds off of his fingertips and he said let there be there's an anointing in this room tonight maybe you don't see it or maybe you don't feel it right now but there's an anointing here that'll drive out every Cancer cell that'll drive out every disease it'll drive out every Creed or dog my idea that you have there's an anointing amongst the body of Jesus Christ that every devil in hell is scared of tonight and that's why the devil shook up tonight is because there's an anointing here that will defeat him Anytime Anyplace under any circumstance I'm not shook up and I'm not scared what the devil may do to you because there's an anointing that is here [Music] I'll let you happen now you know if you're very familiar with a message and I believe I believe that you are you know exactly where I'm drawing this thought from tonight from Christ the mystery God revealed and brother Branham said that in there there would be a Time come forth when he would Express himself in the fullness of a godhead deity through his church and have the preeminence in this church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by Why by accepting what Eve turned down coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see Anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept and we recognize that where we are standing at is a Church of the Living God it's the greatest day where we recognize that there's an extremely strong angel that has stood up in this day and you go to reading Revelations chapter 10 you find that there John represented you as the body of Jesus Christ and the angel said unto him go and eat the book John don't just eat half of it but eat the book and you're recognizing that there is an anointing there's an angel that is here that is standing here tonight and he's watching over every single movement that is going on now we know that the Bible said in second Timothy at 3 and 16 that all scripture is given by the inspiration of God and it's profitable for Doctrine reproof and correction and instruction and we recognize that that the the inspiration of the Lord would move out across across his his Gene seed of God as we could call it that way he would move out across the prophets and those prophets would go in the Old Testament and you would watch them as the prophecy would come forth they were moved by the Holy Ghost to bring for the word in the hour and they recognize it was the same holy ghost that was coming to pass in all of their lives and you watch there's one thing that the elect always is watching for the Bride of Jesus Christ or the the anointed is always looking for it's the Fulfillment of what their prophets had said is that right you're watching for the identification of his presence when it comes behind the word that has been spoken when a prophet has stayed with the word and then that prophet's credentials is that he stayed with the word and you'll find that there in this hour there is a whole gang of people a whole body move of people that has stayed with the word and I have to say that that we as the body of Jesus Christ we are the credentials we are standing we're Toe to Toe with the Devil Himself because we've stayed with the word [Applause] I believe that everything brother Brandon said he said I believe that Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled every description that all the prophets spoke of to be the Messiah you see when Jesus came in flesh he fully accepted his role as the Messiah because he knew who he was he never went around denying that he was a Son of God he never went a day around denying that he was the Messiah but he went around and he clearly put a voice with the word and said I am he he knew who he was and he accepted his position he didn't hang his head down when the enemy or when the people caught him be else above he accepted his position and he walked fully into it when he was standing out there with a woman at the well in John chapter 4 she said I know that when Messiahs come he will tell us of all of these things and he clearly identified who he was when he was speaking to a prostitute when there was a lot of people who thought he should have been talking to them he was out there having a conversation with a prostitute somebody that was a nobody some somebody that should have never been in a picture but the Messiah was out there having a picture or having a conversation with a woman of your Fame somebody that never should have been in a message somebody that should have never been in a message search somebody that never should have been at the whale with a messiah but he was up there identifying who he was to a prostitute and there's a lot of people that thought that you should have never been identified with this message there's a lot of people that said you should have never been identified with a messiah but you have been anointed by accepting who you are there is something on the inside of this body that is moved you to accept that this is your Liberty this is your message I'm sick and tired of people saying it's just William bradham's message this is my message this is our young people's message it will be this message that'll take this body right onto the coming of the Lord knew who he was he accepted who he was you remember when brother Bantam is preaching on the testimony at the sea and he's out there and he's got the disciples and he's he's laying out a drama and he's laying it out and there's John up there and he said I'm fully satisfied that this was a messiah and there Peter and James and they're going through there and they're having a testimony they're having a testimony about about the actions of the Messiah he said now my daddy taught me these things we've looked at the scripture and they've taught us these things he said I'm fully satisfied that he is he is exactly like the Jehovah that was back there in the creation and they were sitting there and they were talking about when he fed the five thousand and he starts breaking the bread off he starts breaking it off and there's another place put in position there's another there's another there's another piece of bread that's went back in the same spot he broke it and it was multiplied he broke it and he was multiplied and it looked like Satan was going to take you down but God put somebody put somebody with something on the inside of them that could go all the way through laodicea and make it and they were having a conversation and while Jesus is back there in the boat and he's and he's back there sleeping and they're having a testimony and they looked out there and they said brother random said that they this one had the habits of Jehovah he's got the habits of Jehovah he acts like Jehovah he thinks like Jehovah he must be Jehovah and you look at this body today she's got the same habits she's got the same habits it ain't just Malachi 4. it's the body of Jesus Christ she's got the habits of Jehovah he just for had he writes it ain't just for me to bring him it's for the Church of the Living God how can those things be she wasn't questioning it she was asking how can I do this oh somebody there's a body of Believers that's anointed by accepting William Branham knew that you'd fulfill this portion coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see Anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and we accept now you go to studying out throughout the Old Testament and you go to looking at the anointing you've got to look at there when they set up altars they would pour out the anointing oil upon the rocks and they would pour it out on pillars they would set up altars and they pour out the anointing oil upon stubs and upon rot and when Moses is back there a little big hit us Leviticus chapter 8. he's up there and he's he's laying out the levitical priesthood how everything is supposed to be set up he's laying all of these things out there and he anoints the vessels in the Tabernacle he anoints Aaron and his sons and he recognize that that priest when he would walk into The Presence of Jehovah he would have to walk in there completely dress right he had to ha he had to have the anointing on him he had to have the sacrifice the blood upon him he had the he had the bells and the pomegranates that were around his robe and they were going up there and they were singing Holy Holy Holy unto the Lord you see all of this was done to ring out a praise unto the great Jehovah and you watch as Moses is up there he goes in there and he anoints the vessels he sprinkles it sprinkles the anointing oil upon all of the vessels up there he goes in there and anoints him to be to sanctify and you watch that there are prophets that are anointed there are Kings I don't know you're very familiar with these things that's why I'm preaching it to you and you you understand that Kings were anointed the kings were set up they were anointed and went just like when you would watch him in the in the book of Samuel that you would watch that God would anoint Saul to be king he would take the Horn of oil and he would pour the oil which was a type of the Holy Ghost he would pour it over his heart you watch what Saul did he couldn't live right he couldn't live right he he got out there he backslipped but he wasn't lost he backslid but the anointing was upon him and David knew that he wasn't going to touch him he said I'm not going to touch the Lord's anoint it but you watch when when Samuel goes out there and he finds and that God says I am anointing another king and Samuel goes out there and his Prophet Groves and he walks out there and he's looking for David but you see Jesse was looking was looking on the natural side of things and there come out all of Jesse's sons and they're stacked out there in front of the prophet and they're stacked out there some are bigger than stature some are greater than knowledge some got a great intellectual DD they've got phds they've got llds they've got all these things but I'm reminded when a prophet said a DD is it's a dumb dog and they stacked up there and they walked out in front of the prophet and the prophet said no these are not the ones you see there might be people that are bigger than you there might be people that that look better than you there might be people that are stronger than you there might be people that have more intellect more wisdom more knowledge than you but there is a major difference between talent and anointing there's a lot of people that can speak better than myself there's a lot of people that can talk better than these bunch of hillbillies that you got preaching to you this weekend but God doesn't want somebody that's got a bunch of intellect and a bunch of knowledge standing before his body he wants somebody that's got anointing there's a major difference between a singer and a real worship leader that's a great major difference between an anointed piano player and somebody that knows all of the keys and all the diaphragms of how it's filled and all of these things God they want somebody that's full of knowledge he's wanting somebody that's emptied out so that he could pour himself in there and he could shake the world with him [Applause] there's a lot of people that have a better ability to be able to be a orator before the people but they have no option of the Holy Ghost they have no power and they have no anointing the Bible said in Ecclesiastes chapter 9 I believe he said it's a living a living dog is better than a dead lion you see I'd rather have somebody that's maybe the poorest poorest preacher but yet he's fully anointed by God than to have some intellectual job that thinks he knows everything about the message to stand up and try to give us some great speech of what he thinks the message is I want somebody that's got the faith that's got the faith to move mountains I want somebody that's got the power to believe that all things are possible I want somebody that's got some anointing on the inside of them that believes that there's a God that is here at the pulpit that can do exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ever ask or think I want somebody that knows how to get a hold of God I want somebody that believes in Malachi 4. I want somebody that believes in Revelations here I want somebody we don't want Talent we want an anointing we want an anointing not a break to yoke off of our young girls we want an anointing that'll break suicide we want an anointing we want an anointing now to break depression we want anoint another break then a break home of sexuality and that anointing is in this room it's in this body and hell is shook up because you're here hell you better be nervous because we have come to tear your shape tear your kingdom down better you got every right to be nervous you got every right to be excited because we're not backing up on one of God blood's Brown promises the oil was a type of the life of the Holy Ghost that has come upon the believer you see when they would those Hebrews back there when they when they watched the anointing oil be poured over top of David they believe that David had the mind of Christ you watch when when what the Bible tells us in James chapter 5 to if there's any sick amongst you let them call upon the Elders of the church and anoint them with oil and pray the prayer of faith over them and it shall save the sick Psalms 28 and 8 says that the Lord is their strength and he is the saving strength of his anointed Psalms 45 and 7 thou love is righteousness and hated wickedness therefore God thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above our fellows Psalms 92 and 10 says but my horn shall thou exalt like the Horn of a unicorn and I shall be Anointed with the fresh oil now watch what it what the tri the passion translation says your anointing has made me strong in Mighty you've empowered my life for Triumph by pouring fresh oil over me you have made your anointing has made me strong and mighty Paul said in second Corinthians 1 and 21 now he would establish us with you in Christ have anointed us as God it's not the man here at the pulpit it is the anointing of almighty God that has anointed us if any of us preachers have the ability to make you call to make you elect we'd have done did it we'd have done went down to Walmart and anointed every single body there we'd have made we'd made them all bright of Jesus Christ but there is a gene said of God that has allowed you to be who you are you see it wasn't just the oil that was poured over top of David that made him there made him the anointed you could take that same oil and pour it on the top on the top of all of Jesse's Sons but it never would have made them the anointed of God because God had already seen that David's heart was pure before him he had the heart after God what was it David was quick to repent and I find that is the hardest thing for believers to do sometimes is to repent and say I'm sorry it ain't gonna hurt you he won't kill you he won't hurt you just say look I've been wrong about some things I'm sorry I've done some things wrong you know we won't think no less of you if you repent and think you're not anointed we're going to know you're anointed because you're repented we're gonna know you're anointed because you come after the heart of God notice what John 3 and 27 that John answered and said a man can receive nothing except to be given him from heaven now you know you remember when brother Brandon is he's there and he has his dream he has his dream about this man this this great big pearly man that is beating this woman and brother random thought that it was his mama at first he was this big great big ball in my hand was beating this woman with a three-corner club and every time every time it looked like she would rise up that man would go to beat her down with that pretty Corner club and brother Brandon said I was I was scared of that man at first he said I was scared of that man at first he said but all of a sudden I reached some pair and I grabbed him by the caller and said you stop that or you're going to have to deal with me you see what he what it was is that woman was the churches of the world and if that man that man was the denominations that was trying to rule the church and it was taking her and he was beating her with that Three Corner Club of trinitarian baptism in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost and every single time she'd rise up to accept the truth he'd go to beat her down go beat her down with with his with his Doctrine and with his idea you see that's what Satan will do to you every single time you come to accept the truth and accept what's right and accept this anointing he will try to beat you down with circumstances and beat you down with problems and beat you down with cancer and beat you down with troubles and beat you down with fights between one another and beat you down within those secrecies and all of these things but you see if Satan can keep you afraid of your inheritance that's where he's got you at but I don't believe that you're a bunch of wimpy Christians that just easy roll over when the pastor don't talk to you I happen to believe that you're the strongest body the most powerful body that there ever has been upon the face of the Earth yeah and you're going to turn down Satan's life you're going to turn down his life you're going to turn down what he said about you you're going to turn down what he said and you're going to accept what God has said about you [Applause] your pastor brother Tim has been a very special friend to our family he's been there he's been there through the thick and the thin and I thank God for the man Tim Pruitt anybody else let me tell you if you're dying and you've been burned up playing in a coma for 17 days you you might want to have Tim Brook come by your way well Tim's been a friend in good times and he's been a friend in bad times and when I was going to the greatest trial of my Ministry when my Ministry was under attack because Satan loves to attack the ministry like never before what is he after he's after your anointing Samson you see if he can get you to lay your head over and lay ought to see his lap he'll take your anointing away from you but it's time that you shake yourself he's after your anointing and when I was in my greatest trial preachers don't have those that's what some people think brother Tim sent me this when you are gifted and anointed Satan will personally assign someone to bring you down just so your gift and anointing won't manifest but the enemy cannot kill what God has anointed to live he cannot stop who God is chosen to prosper and he cannot block what God is called to manifest you are gifted and you are anointed Satan has somebody that is after your anointing but there is a power in the house of God to shut down every blockade of hell you're not going to stop the anointing we're just going to let it operate more you can try to shut down the move of God you can try to shut down our power but God has quoted to manifest let the sons of God begin to operate in their anointing the Bible said in Psalms 105 and 15 touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm [Applause] it's a dangerous thing when you go to touching the anointing of the Lord and I ain't just talking about preachers I'm talking about you Satan has messed up when he's come back your way brother Lemuel and he besides that he's going to cut you and hinder you and try to stop the move of God in your life hell is messed up and he spits on their own set of preachers because we're not backing off and we're not backing up we believe he's still the same yesterday today and forever try to stop our anointing try to stop our gift try to stop our preaching we're just gonna rise up that much stronger we're going to rise up that much more powerful thank you it's dangerous when you go to touching the Lord's anointed Satan be careful is this all right I'll press okay brother one brother random he goes to preaching the seahorse and he starts taking us through the greatest the greatest release on the ministry that we've ever seen and he starts taking us through these things and brother Branham said that every single time that the Antichrist would send out one of his writers that the that that that the end that the Antichrist would send out one of his writers that God would send out a power or an anointing to combat to combat that power and watch what brother Adam says here in the fifth seal he said when that Antichrist was riding with his false teaching God sent his teaching out there the word the lion of the tribatuto which is the word may manifest in the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is there to manifest himself which is the word he said that's the reason that the early church had healings and miracles and visions and power is because it was the Living Word in the form of the Lion of the tribe of Judah writing out there to combat that amen now you got it he sends his power the Antichrist and God sends his word so the enemy comes in like a flood but God raises up a standard now what is it you're not living in the Life age you're not living under that anointing but you are living under the Flying Eagle anointing what was that anointing it was Malachi 4 to restore the faith back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers and just setting him he's still on the ground like a bunch of chickens you have rose up under the Flying Eagle anointing and you were under the Dominion of the anointed one to restore back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers that what this message does it does not leave you where I found you it takes you higher what is it we are under a divine order to carry out the commission of this age when Paul was standing there when Paul was standing there and he's coming up into it and he's coming up into a certain city and he can't find nobody up there he can't find nobody up there that's preaching that's preaching Divine Healing all of them had done become a bunch of denominationalists but there he found one by the name of Timothy that was up there holding a healing campaign and brother random said he had such an atmosphere about him but there was lives that was being changed there was Miracles that were being done and that word in the church today will create the same type of atmosphere you see what's happening is that Satan is upset about the atmosphere that's going on in here he gets upset because there's an anointing here that'll make you speak in another language there's an anointing here that'll make you dance and it'll make you shout there's an anointing here that'll make you catch who you are in the Lord Jesus Christ now I'm gonna drive some things if that's all right with you just for a moment now brother random Will Tell Us in in A God Called man he said there's a lot of people that misunderstand what the anointing is he said they get there he said and they think that the anointing is that of emotions of jumping and shouting he said that is Joy he said but it's not an it's not an it's not anointing and then he would go over there and why people are so tossed about he said he said now emotions he said emotions is not the anointing he said anointing is supreme power under control he's now wind was the greatest anointing on Earth ever he said was in our Lord Jesus Christ and he said he went up there and he grabbed Isaiah 61 and he took the book and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears and he set back down he said now we would want to run and jump and run all over the building he said but that is not it he said it is a supreme power under control now I know the devil likes to think that that just because we preached that quote that he can push us in some Corner the reason why we jump the reason why we shout the reason why we believe the reason why we accept is because there is an anointing here these young people have been taught under this message they've said here under the greatest Ministry and they're not just excited there's an anointing that is upon the body it's the same inspiration that was back there in the Garden of Eden and Adam was standing there and he was calling such and such by their names because it is an anointing and there's an anointing here to call out every black shadow there's an anointing here to call out every disease there's an anointing here that will break the yoke upon your life that's what the Bible tells us in Isaiah 10 and 27 that that that that there will be a burden that will be taken away from you and it is the anointing that breaks the Yoke off of your life now Satan wants to keep you under the Yoke of the enemy but there's an anointing to break every stronghold that is stacked up against you I don't know why we're here but we're here but Satan wants to keep you from accepting your Liberty in the Lord Jesus Christ he wants to keep you from accepting that it's it's for every person in the building he wants to make you think it's for a day gone by but he is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and the Bride of Jesus Christ she is not just some push-off she's not just some schoolgirl she knows exactly who she is she know exactly where she came from and yes she's a paradox yes it's incredible but it's true but there is a faith in the body of Jesus Christ to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you can ever ask or think according to the power that works on the inside of this body if Joshua was anointed you're anointed if Moses wasn't on this you're anointed if he could ask if God could call angels from heaven and say God you that you gave will go down there and you watch over Moses as he's going down the Nile River and you keep him from those crocodiles what was it he was watching over God's anointing you recognize that there's an angel that is overcharged over top of every single one of you here tonight now you may not see it but that I feel the influence of them here right now and I I believe that there are angels that are at their posts of Duty you remember when Jacob is up there and then the Bible said in Genesis that there was angels that was descending and ascending upon that ladder brother random said that God's got angels that are at their post adorned post of Duty and they're watching over your life to make sure you get everything you have need of out of this meeting all right get my angel just a little bit of room let him operate right here let him operate right here what did Eve turn down she turned down the rights to the tree of life she turned down the word she turned down supreme power she she turned down she she turned down Adam being able to move mountains for him she turned down the ability to move cancer cells who in here is fought cancer before who in here fought a bad headache before I finally got you to raise your hand who in here is fall bad bad backaches before she was turning down the right turning down the rights to control the atmospheres brother Matthew you think to turn down the rights to the Tree of Life but you're anointed by accepting it you're anointed by saying I I accept that mountains can be moved I accept that squirrels can be created I accept that tumors can dissolve I ain't I accept the cancer and brain bleeds can be broke up I accept that particles can come back home I accept the mountains can be moved I accept that storms can be controlled I accept that death can be rolled back I accept that I could go on a Rapture I accept him as my savior I accept him as Martin delivery I accept him as my protector I accept him that is going to make me who I'm supposed to be you're anointed by accepting what Eve turned down but what about the rest of the world they're anointed by rejecting it but you're anointed by accepting it we will not turn our backs on you Lord where would we go for you only have the words of life my words are spirit and they are life [Music] do you think do you think I would turn down the rights to break every Cancer cell in my dad's body right now do you think I would turn down the rights to accept complete healing for sister Ruth do you think I would turn down the rights [Applause] to set me in free from Every Chain of DNA complexes that's been built up in their life why in our right mind when we turn down the anointing when we return down when men would push us aside when men would say we're not good enough why would we turn down the rights to the Tree of Life but the Bible said in the Book of Revelation I have given you rights as an overcomer to the tree of life and if God gives you something God ain't taking it away Joshua was anointed to go into the promised land and you're anointed to accept the opening of The Seven Seals you're not holding a close book you're holding the greatest anointed that's why Hale is so upset is because you are an open book people Josh wondered that commission he crossed across the Jordan River he took down Jericho he saved Rahab he conquered the land he stopped the sun because he was anointed he was anointed to take the land and there's a bunch of squatters that's trying to keep you off of your Promised Land he's trying to keep you from the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's trying to keep you from your breakthrough he's trying to keep you from your repentance he's trying to keep you from being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but there's an anointing here that'll make sure that you get what you came for you see they came up against this prodigal or they excuse me they came up against these promises they came up against these promises with rumors and negativity that surely this can't be the move of God surely this can't be the anointing if it really was the anointing God would have chose me to do it God would have chose this one to do it no God has his way of choosing who he wants leading and dividing the words of truth yeah what did he do he come in there with rumors and negativity and tried to keep Joshua and Caleb out of their Promised Land what was he doing what was he afraid of he was afraid that if Joshua ever got in he'd never get him out let me tell you he is so scared that you'll get the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's so scared that you accept this as your faith he's so scared that if you get in he'll never get you out it's too late we've accepted the truth we've accepted our breakthrough it's too late we've turned down the devil's life it's too late we're already here it's too late the Raptors in us it's too late it is too late devil we're not backing off he's trying to keep you from the anointing he's trying to keep her from worship but God said let go and let God let go and let God brother Adams which I heard him say today he said some of you are afraid to let go and let God just give him your habits give him your ideas give him your thoughts let go and let God he said well I don't know how to let God I don't know how to let go and let God brother random said yes you do [Applause] let go I don't know how to break free yes you do okay [Applause] I don't know how to worship yes you do I don't know how to break through yes you do whom the son is set free is free indeed if your legs are free he ain't locking you up God said kind of God he can get you in and he can get you out if Satan got you into trouble gotta get you out and Satan put cancer on you gotta get it out [Applause] your Mom and Daddy can be worried I need to worry about you all your life but one time with the anointing one time I have found the Messiah I have found the Messiah I have found him he's right here I have found him he told me who I was he called me by my name he told me where I came from and he told me where I'm going I'm not scared about these young boys I know that hey if they could accept this anointing here I don't know why but we're here if they can accept this anointing there is no stronghold that the devil can put on him because there is a weapon that is here the cast down every stronghold and every Power of hell don't you time to take away that breakthrough don't you try to take away their Joy don't you try to take away their dance don't you try to take away their shouts aren't you trying to take it away if you taking it away you're taking away the Breakthrough you're taking away their anointing you're taking away the Rapture I'm not going to take a lag I'm going to give them exactly what they need let's give them a message diet be fully on the son of man hail through me everything hell offered me everything you wanted he threw money at me I won't tell you everything because I ain't expecting you to tell me everything thank you thank you but hell will offer you all kinds of things it'll offer you sin it'll offer you a bottle but it won't show you the man laying down there in the gutter he won't eat off for a hell or offer you a cigarette young boy but he won't all he won't show you that man laying there in the hospital Satan's offer seems real nice it seems real pleasing I got offered Major Baseball League money to do the same thing I do every single day Satan knows how to offer you things it seems real enticing I can do the same thing I do every single day and make Major League Baseball money Satan say oh I'm sure I got it but you're worth it I'd had to give up coming preaching these meetings I didn't give up time on my family I had to give up time in my church I'd had to give up I'd have to give up my life to accept what Satan's offer was but I was anointed to turn down because one of these young boys and one of these young girls is work every bit of energy that I can pour in no I ain't delicate in speech but there's an anointing here tonight that'll tell you burn down the devil's life you're not a homosexual you're not going to commit suicide you're not going to go the way of Korah you're gonna rise to accept the anointing of the lord it's the Rapture for this body your hand little body it's the word of Jesus Christ take it and cut Satan's head off somebody's gonna be anointed somebody's gonna be anointed to look out there upon that Goliath and say not today there's going to be somebody that walks out there a little boy and a little girl says I accept this message [Applause] I heard brother banham say the other day he said the rest of those Israelites believed it could be done he said but it was revealed to David that it could be done the reason why you're here is because it's been revealed to you that you are the most powerful people on the face of the Earth I'll say cancer ain't got a chance standing in front of this body oh yes Hallelujah mother Angel you don't know what you don't know what I'm going through you don't know my family you don't know the darkness that's following me let's try to take my memory this is for you because this is completely off the script let me tell you I love it when the author flips the script you ever been reading a book and it's going one way and man you got this thing figured out this thing figured out and you get to the back of the books man I went completely different than I expected well Satan's looking Satan's looking at a bunch of lives at the author flipped the script on it ain't just about discernment tonight being flipped on me it's because the offer is flipping the script in your life and you thought it was going one way when your memory was playing painted with all kinds of circumstances things that your mama said about you things that your daddy said about you things that the world said about you but you're anointed churches may hurt you churches may as hard to preachers may hurt you let him put the script tonight you're not going to go down to Phoenix you're gonna rise up Victorious as the body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah flip the script tonight Lord change their ways change their ideas let the anointing come and break every yoke in here no you're not like the first thief in the beginning she listened to the devil's lies but you're predestinated not to do it you're not gonna fail you're not going to be defeated you're gonna win Soldier Boy Soldier Boy you'll not commit suicide what happened the flip got script the script got flipped you were walking one way and God Turn the page on you you thought you were hell-bent and he thought you were help out but God flipped the script Satan thought you had it he would Bond it's Satan thoughts he had you with alcohol Satan thought he had to with pornography that God said not today flip the script the blood is more powerful Satan's power is not enough to break the power of this Blood this blood is all powerful this blood is Jesus Christ and you have the partying power from the inside of you that's why brother random said she'll be a token to the whole world there's been churches churches Brides brides but there must come one that's both mechanics and Dynamics let me tell you we've had enough intellectualism rise up in this message and it's never produced One victory you can know every quote and you can be a Jack Van Impe of this message and you can know it from the 1947 all the way to 65. but where you stop I continue because the anointing that was on William Branham his homeless body there's an angel in this room it might be dark streets in your family history but there's a light that is here to break it don't touch mining on it foreign will never win over you he thought it could keep you from complete Victory but it'll never win that anointing try and tried and tried but when he got you where he wanted you it broke it made you think it was just for your daddy anointing for you he'll keep your children thank you I ain't nothing too hard for him if he could have a prostitute sitting at a well with him that would drop her water bottle it would make her run back to the men that she'd been with before I said I have found him I have found him I have found him and you have run from Well to Well you have rung from church to church but the Messiah is setting at your well they're not going back the same way you came in here anointing it's not going to leave you he's not going to leave you sick he's not going to leave your pound he's not going to leave you paddling the anointing is stronger than ever disease the anointing will follow you home the anointing will break it well I'm going to do everything to stop it you can't stop this move you can't stop this anointing you can't stop this body she says thus save the Lord when she sets still wants the Harmony in this body she knows what he wants done with the word she speaks his word by his command what is it it's the sovereignty of God you don't need squirrels tonight you don't need a snowstorm rolled out but you need that third poor anointing to come in your family and you feel you liked ever before you need that purple anointing to go in there and cut the last head off things that's kept you from your breakthrough things that's kept you from being free in this service things that's held you down little things that's been laying there Satan can't hide under this anointing foreign because it breaks the yolk Jesus was anointed over the Supernatural and he cast out devils he was anointed and had power over death had power over the thing that was holding Lazarus and cherries he had power over the natural world and he spoke peace be still and he is your savior he is your savior he will save you from yourself when you can't keep you from yourself you're the biggest mess in the room you're the biggest mess in this room and you think he can't get to you all I want to crumb all I want to crumb for my family he's here why don't you let him save you from yourself I'm gonna live on my own world because there's an anointing that says I got the faith create a new world and go live on it if you follow the way you're going you've got tribulation on your own but if you'll follow this anointing can I prophesy to you tonight will be the last night that you deal with those things if you come to this anointing if he found me on the street surely he can find you in a pew I'm going to play tapes the rest of my life and I'm going to live out there and I'm going to listen to the true one that might work for you but it won't work for your children it's time to come to the well [Music] every head bow foreign you've been talking to me I've said it away with him for the last hour and he's called me by my name then he's telling you you can drop Where You Are and you can go live under the anointing foreign you're anointed by accepting him as your healer as your savior and Jesus would stand there and say thy faith has saved thee one atonement for your healing and for your soul why don't you let your faith loose even so well I don't know how to yes you do why don't you let go of yesterday and why don't you let go of yourself I
