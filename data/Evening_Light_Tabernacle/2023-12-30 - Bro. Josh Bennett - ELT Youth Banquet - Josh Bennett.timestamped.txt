[0:25] it's a good time to reflect on what what
[0:28] what went on in your life this past year
[0:30] and maybe where you can move in right
[0:33] directions in the next year and and so
[0:36] we just wanted to have this weekend of

[0:40] that and so want to welcome everyone we

[0:44] tonight and just want to thank you for
[0:46] coming and and being a part and also I
[0:49] want to thank all the who helped in some
[0:52] capacity to get things ready for the

[1:41] Eden and I I don't know about you but
[1:43] I'm looking forward to going back to the
[1:45] place where we belong and that's with
[1:47] our Lord Jesus Christ in the place of no
[1:50] sorrow no death no one missing around
[1:53] the table no one having sicknesses you
[1:56] know may been somebody that missed
[1:58] tonight because they're bit they were

[2:13] sister Linda's age you start thinking
[2:15] about old
[2:18] age and uh the older you get the more
[2:21] you think about it and the time that's
[2:23] passing um if I can encourage you to do
[2:26] anything take advantage of the time you
[2:28] have right now and and don't let it just
[2:30] slip through your fingers as sand does
[2:33] in your hand when you pick it up on the
[2:34] seashore and it just falls through your
[2:36] fingers but as the Bible said redeem the
[2:39] time and uh make take advantage of every

[1:09:28] curse of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost
[1:09:31] accepts you he says the desire of sin
[1:09:34] has done gone from your heart and when
[1:09:37] the Holy Spirit comes in you are
[1:09:40] restored he says and then when the earth
[1:09:42] is restored by the same thing there can
[1:09:44] be no more cursing no more storms no
[1:09:46] more winds no more typhoons he says you
[1:09:50] are reconciled man and God has met the
[1:09:53] new Earth will put on its Eden Beauty

[1:10:01] holy spirit of God will cleanse off
[1:10:03] every Speck of all the sin and
[1:10:05] everything all the devil will be bound
[1:10:07] and cast into the Lake of Fire consuming
[1:10:09] fire he says man and God Has Come

[1:10:34] and for his that was redeemed out of it
[1:10:37] see he says and look you are a part of

[1:10:43] you he redeemed the Earth with the same
[1:10:45] thing and you are together again oh how
[1:10:48] much plainer can it be see you have to
[1:10:51] be redeemed because you're part of of it
[1:10:54] and we're so thankful tonight that as we

[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:49] we live in a world that always questions
[1:24:53] if there could be a God in heaven every
[1:24:58] day we see thetics
[1:25:01] wonder
[1:25:04] how saying the Bible is
[1:25:07] outdated and that there's no way to
[1:25:11] explain it and the evidence is nowhere
[1:25:16] to be
[1:25:19] found but I see it is every time I look
[1:25:25] [Music]
[1:25:27] around I know that God is real and His
[1:25:32] glory is
[1:25:34] revealed in the heart of everyone who
[1:25:39] just
[1:25:41] believes he still saves and changes
[1:25:45] lives and there's no way to
[1:25:49] deny the difference that he made inside
[1:25:54] of
[1:25:57] me it's more than just
[1:26:01] emotion that I
[1:26:04] feel God is
[1:26:15] real and I can remember who I was and
[1:26:20] now I'm who I am and because there's a
[1:26:24] living God who came and made me

[1:29:20] real
[1:29:23] [Music]
[1:29:26] well good evening
[1:29:27] friends so good to have you all here
[1:29:30] this
[1:29:31] evening it's been a beautiful evening we
[1:29:34] got a beautiful
[1:29:36] setting lots of beautiful decorations
[1:29:39] things to kind of make
[1:29:42] us think about a place that we want to
[1:29:45] prepare our hearts
[1:29:46] for that
[1:29:49] we want to get ready to to go to the
[1:29:53] world that we live in is a world full of
[1:29:57] chaos
[1:29:58] trouble it's not getting better it's
[1:30:01] getting worse as we
[1:30:05] go nothing that the governments can do
[1:30:08] of the world can turn this into an
[1:30:11] Eden nothing can fix the problems that
[1:30:14] our world is facing
[1:30:17] today but the thing about
[1:30:20] it that is so
[1:30:23] important is not
[1:30:25] fixing the world that we're living in at
[1:30:28] this
[1:30:29] moment but fixing the heart and
[1:30:33] preparing it for an
[1:30:36] Eden we look at the beautiful scenery
[1:30:39] around and can
[1:30:42] only just vaguely imagine what Eden must
[1:30:46] have been
[1:30:48] like the lion laid down with the lamb
[1:30:53] [Music]
[1:30:57] there was no evil no bad
[1:31:01] thoughts nothing wrong that could ever
[1:31:04] happen seem seemingly till sin
[1:31:09] iner I can only imagine there is Adam
[1:31:13] stood there in the garden and you know
[1:31:14] the lion was very much a lion and lamb
[1:31:18] very much a
[1:31:20] lamb but if there would have been
[1:31:22] something that would rise up within
[1:31:24] there you see Adam was the
[1:31:28] king in in the
[1:31:32] Eden his very presence would bring
[1:31:36] peace you look over at the LI lion and
[1:31:39] say down
[1:31:41] boy that's
[1:31:44] all he would go back to being
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:31:50] gentle you know when you think about
[1:31:53] your own
[1:31:56] life there is a beast nature that every
[1:32:01] one of you were born
[1:32:04] with that Beast is a lion he'll tear
[1:32:09] he'll destroy he'll wreck families he'll
[1:32:13] ruin
[1:32:15] homes but if you can ever get the
[1:32:19] king the Lord Jesus's C on the throne of
[1:32:22] your
[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:24] heart every time the lion raises up the
[1:32:28] Beast he'll just say down boy come
[1:32:33] subject there'll be peace that's what we
[1:32:36] want for you young people we want peace
[1:32:39] to rain in your hearts I know the gospel
[1:32:43] works you know here I
[1:32:46] am coming up this next year and the boy

[1:32:52] message when I was 15 years old I was
[1:32:57] your
[1:32:58] [Music]
[1:33:00] age I was
[1:33:02] you I am the I am
[1:33:05] proof that the message
[1:33:08] works it's not only worked for me it
[1:33:12] worked for 45 wonderful years of
[1:33:15] marriage it not only worked for me and
[1:33:18] my wife It produced four wonderful
[1:33:21] children children with their spouses and
[1:33:24] now they're my

[1:33:36] life yeah we can talk about an Eden that
[1:33:40] will be one
[1:33:42] day where the wolf will be gentle and
[1:33:46] the lamb will be
[1:33:50] tame but right now you can have an Eden
[1:33:54] on the inside of you maybe chaos all
[1:33:58] around maybe chaos even in your family
[1:34:01] or in situations around the world that
[1:34:04] you're living in but I'll tell
[1:34:08] you he'll come down in your life and be

[1:34:42] comes in he'll be the king of your life
[1:34:48] tonight we have had this time together
[1:34:52] just to stop and reflect and enjoy a
[1:34:55] moment enjoy some peace and
[1:34:59] fellowship that in this Shadow land it's
[1:35:02] just
[1:35:03] a it's just a mere kind of reflection of
[1:35:07] what it will be there Heaven won't be a
[1:35:10] boring place in fact of the matter is
[1:35:13] you won't stay there long we'll come
[1:35:14] back here to live on the
[1:35:17] earth but
[1:35:19] nevertheless nobody have to sneak in a
[1:35:22] game to play and you know this or that
[1:35:27] no it won't be an eternal church service
[1:35:29] where we're just all singing and and and
[1:35:32] praying and shouting and that would be a
[1:35:35] boring Place
[1:35:39] yeah but let me tell you what it'll
[1:35:42] be it'll be an eternity of Avent
[1:35:46] Adventures seeing
[1:35:49] things in a way that could could never
[1:35:51] be seen here in this carnal
[1:35:55] world this life is coming to the end we
[1:35:58] want you to make ready to be there to
[1:36:01] take part of the adventures that lie
[1:36:04] ahead great things are in your
[1:36:07] future God bless you tonight we're going
[1:36:10] to invite our brother Joshua Bennett to
[1:36:13] come brother Joshua comes from North
[1:36:16] Carolina we've learned to really love
[1:36:20] and appreciate him and
[1:36:23] Ministry I you know one of the songs
[1:36:26] that he
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:28] sang here at evening light Tabernacle
[1:36:31] has had over 70,000 views
[1:36:34] and he's
[1:36:36] popular I don't know if he'll sing for
[1:36:38] you tonight but we know this that God is
[1:36:42] God and he'll make himself real to you
[1:36:45] God bless you brother Josh as you come
[1:36:47] will you welcome him
[1:36:50] tonight
[1:37:05] amen I won't be singing
[1:37:08] tonight amen we count it an honor and a
[1:37:11] privilege to be here and anytime we have
[1:37:13] the opportunity to speak to a portion of
[1:37:17] the Bride of Jesus Christ we count it a
[1:37:19] great honor and uh also recognize the
[1:37:22] great
[1:37:23] responsibility of of speaking to the
[1:37:25] purchase of the blood and as uh brother
[1:37:29] Aron made a few comments and then
[1:37:30] brother Tim was making comments um I
[1:37:33] thought well maybe I could just get up
[1:37:36] and say that's exactly what I was going
[1:37:38] to try to
[1:37:39] say and then we could uh just just let
[1:37:43] you enjoy the evening but I wonder if we
[1:37:46] could just bow our hearts together and
[1:37:47] have a word of prayer as we approach the
[1:37:49] word tonight Lord Jesus we ser certainly
[1:37:51] thank you for this time of fellowship
[1:37:54] and this Gathering we look out and see
[1:37:56] these these young faces and young people
[1:37:59] Lord and all the things that they could
[1:38:01] be doing and the desires that they could
[1:38:03] have and the places that they could go
[1:38:05] but but Lord you've brought them
[1:38:07] together in a place like this and in a
[1:38:09] time like this and Lord they've set
[1:38:12] aside their time to come and and to have
[1:38:14] this Fellowship not just with one
[1:38:16] another but Lord we want to have
[1:38:18] fellowship with you and so Lord we just
[1:38:20] ask that you would just come and as we
[1:38:24] look into your word and we open the the
[1:38:27] pages of the Bible God we're asking that
[1:38:29] the the author of the book would just
[1:38:31] come down now and Lord may you just move
[1:38:34] Among Us and speak to hearts and Lord
[1:38:37] you take the the the word and and just
[1:38:40] break it like the bread Lord I I think
[1:38:43] about how that one day Lord uh there was
[1:38:46] a multitude of people that were hungry
[1:38:49] but there was a little boy that had a
[1:38:50] lunch
[1:38:52] and he didn't have a whole lot but when
[1:38:54] it got in your hands you took it and
[1:38:56] multiplied what he had and fed the
[1:38:58] multitude that was there Lord I pray
[1:39:02] that you would do that this evening just
[1:39:04] take the little that we have and Lord
[1:39:06] may you just take it and feed every
[1:39:08] Hungry Heart and Lord just break the
[1:39:11] bread and Lord as you hand it down we'll
[1:39:13] just hand it out to them just the way
[1:39:16] that you've handed it to us Lord we
[1:39:19] commit ourselves in this service into
[1:39:20] your hands now and we ask it in Jesus
[1:39:23] name amen amen I'm going to read a
[1:39:27] couple scriptures out of the Book of
[1:39:29] Genesis and I want to read from Genesis
[1:39:31] the first chapter and uh just with the
[1:39:34] theme in mind tonight of restored Eden
[1:39:37] uh but I'd like to to approach it from
[1:39:41] this thought a res uh restored
[1:39:44] Fellowship leading to a restored eating
[1:39:47] so I believe that um as it's already
[1:39:50] been been said tonight that we're on our
[1:39:52] way back we're on our way back to to
[1:39:55] that Eden condition that that place of
[1:39:58] perfection that's what we're on our way
[1:40:00] to uh but we know that right now we're
[1:40:03] living in Satan's Eden and and we can
[1:40:06] very clearly see that all around us uh
[1:40:09] uh you know it's just um the world is
[1:40:12] not getting any better like brother Tim
[1:40:14] said it's not getting any and and and
[1:40:15] it's not going to get any better the
[1:40:17] world that we're currently living in the
[1:40:20] conditions are going to continue to get
[1:40:22] worse because this is Satan's Eden but
[1:40:25] there's going to be some that's going to
[1:40:27] overcome see there's going to be people
[1:40:30] even though that we're living in Satan's
[1:40:33] Eden we're not going to be a part of
[1:40:36] that because there's another kingdom
[1:40:38] that we're reflecting brother brandham
[1:40:40] said it this way in the church age book
[1:40:42] he said we are reflecting the kingdom of
[1:40:45] our rebirth and so that's why we live
[1:40:48] the way we live and we we dress the way
[1:40:51] we dress and we talk the way we talk
[1:40:53] because we are not of this world Amen we
[1:40:57] and we're reflecting the kingdom of our
[1:41:00] rebirth and so I just want you to have
[1:41:02] that in mind as we look at this tonight
[1:41:05] Genesis 1:24 and the Bible says and God
[1:41:08] said let the Earth bring forth the
[1:41:10] living creature after his kind cattle
[1:41:12] and the creeping thing the Beast of the
[1:41:14] earth after his kind and it was so and
[1:41:18] God made the Beast of the earth after
[1:41:19] his kind and the cattle after their kind
[1:41:21] and everything that creepeth upon the
[1:41:23] Earth after his kind and God saw that it
[1:41:26] was good and God said let us make man in
[1:41:28] our image after our likeness and let
[1:41:31] them have dominion over the fish of the
[1:41:34] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[1:41:36] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[1:41:38] and over every creeping thing that
[1:41:40] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[1:41:42] man in his own image and the image of
[1:41:45] God created he him male and female
[1:41:48] created he them genes Genesis 2 and
[1:41:52] verse 7 and the Lord God formed Man Out
[1:41:54] of the Dust of the ground and breathed
[1:41:56] into his nostrils the breath of life and
[1:41:59] Man became a living soul and the Lord
[1:42:02] God planted a garden Eastward in Eden
[1:42:05] and there he put the man whom he had
[1:42:06] formed and out of the ground uh the made
[1:42:09] the Lord God to grow every tree that is
[1:42:11] Pleasant to the sight and good for food
[1:42:15] the tree of life and also in the midst
[1:42:17] of the garden and the tree of know
[1:42:20] knowledge of Good and Evil in verse 15
[1:42:23] of the same chapter and the Lord God
[1:42:24] took the man and put him into the Garden
[1:42:28] of Eden to dress it and to keep it the
[1:42:31] Lord God commanded the man saying of
[1:42:33] every tree of the garden thou May freely
[1:42:36] eat but of the tree of knowledge of Good
[1:42:38] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in
[1:42:41] the day that thou eatest thereof Thou
[1:42:43] shalt surely die and so we see in this
[1:42:47] that God had created the Earth and and
[1:42:51] then within that creation he had planted
[1:42:53] a garden now this this Garden that God
[1:42:56] had had had created or there in the
[1:43:00] earth was a place where Adam would live
[1:43:02] a place where the tree of life would
[1:43:04] grow the place where where man would
[1:43:06] actually have fellowship with God
[1:43:08] because brother Brown would talk about
[1:43:09] how that God would come down in the cool
[1:43:11] of the evening and into the garden there
[1:43:14] and he would have Fellowship uh with
[1:43:16] with man and we can see that by the
[1:43:19] scripture that we read that Man was
[1:43:21] created to have dominion is that right
[1:43:24] we we see that very clearly uh in the
[1:43:27] scripture that man was made to have
[1:43:30] dominion over all the the the the
[1:43:32] creation the the fish and the cattle and
[1:43:35] the Beast of the earth man was made to
[1:43:38] rule or have dominion over the Earth and
[1:43:41] so brother Brandon would say uh say it
[1:43:44] this way in the cruelty of sin and the
[1:43:46] penalty that it cost to rid Sin from our
[1:43:48] lives that's quite a title he said said
[1:43:50] it this way he said when God made his
[1:43:52] first man he was a spirit man we see
[1:43:54] that in Genesis 1 and he was something
[1:43:57] on the order of God see or the Son of
[1:44:00] God he said the first man and he gave
[1:44:03] that man the jurisdiction to lead all
[1:44:06] the animal life he said just like the
[1:44:09] Holy Spirit leads the believer today he
[1:44:12] said see to go here and do this and if
[1:44:15] we were per in perfect submission to the
[1:44:18] Holy Spirit God would lead us by theol
[1:44:20] Holy Spirit just like Adam led the
[1:44:23] animals of that day and you see how
[1:44:26] perfectly it even ties with what brother
[1:44:29] Tim was saying that Adam when God
[1:44:31] created Adam he first created him a
[1:44:33] spirit man and he was in the image of
[1:44:36] God we know that God was a god of the
[1:44:38] whole universe but but God is a spirit
[1:44:42] is that right and so he is he's
[1:44:45] controlling the whole universe and Adam
[1:44:47] as a as a the Son of God in the garden
[1:44:50] of Eden he was a spirit man but God gave
[1:44:53] him dominion and I love how brother
[1:44:55] Brown would say he he led the animal
[1:44:58] kingdom uh as a as a spirit uh there in
[1:45:01] the Garden of Eden like the Holy Spirit
[1:45:03] leads uh the church today and and if
[1:45:06] we're in perfect submission to the Holy
[1:45:08] Spirit it'll bring peace just the same
[1:45:11] kind of peace that there was in the
[1:45:12] Garden of Eden it'll bring that kind of
[1:45:14] peace in our lives and so uh but then we
[1:45:18] see that there was no man to till the
[1:45:20] soul and then then we see uh God forming
[1:45:23] a Man Out of the Dust of the earth and
[1:45:25] then in the in the message Oneness
[1:45:27] brother Brown said now the first man and
[1:45:29] the first woman in the Garden of Eden
[1:45:31] was in perfect harmony with God so much
[1:45:34] that God could come down at any time he
[1:45:36] desired and talk lip to ear to Adam and
[1:45:39] Eve now that's the perfect Oneness now
[1:45:41] and I want you to think about this
[1:45:43] tonight that God would could come down
[1:45:45] at any time at any time into the Garden
[1:45:48] of Eden and have fellowship with with
[1:45:50] his children Amen in other words God
[1:45:54] didn't come down just at appointed times
[1:45:56] or or just you know he didn't just have
[1:45:59] times that he would come but God could
[1:46:00] come down at any time I want you to
[1:46:03] catch that tonight that God don't want
[1:46:05] to just have fellowship with you three
[1:46:08] times a week just while you're in church
[1:46:11] but God ought to be able to come down
[1:46:13] and visit you at any
[1:46:16] time and listen if you're uh if you've
[1:46:19] been born again and filled with the
[1:46:21] spirit of God Amen God ought to be able
[1:46:23] to come into your
[1:46:25] bedroom God ought to be able to visit
[1:46:27] you in the in the secret places and when
[1:46:31] when nobody knows what what you're doing
[1:46:33] but I tell you God knows what you're
[1:46:34] doing amen but God could even come down
[1:46:37] and fellowship with you just at any time
[1:46:40] that's the kind of fellowship and the
[1:46:42] Oneness that that that they had there in
[1:46:45] the Garden of Eden watch brother Ram
[1:46:46] said it was just perfect harmony with
[1:46:49] God until they were were so one with God
[1:46:51] and God and his family was one and
[1:46:54] another place he said and when God made
[1:46:55] man in the beginning to fellowship with
[1:46:57] him then this man was in perfect
[1:46:59] Fellowship in the Garden of Eden he was
[1:47:01] in perfect fellowship with God and how
[1:47:04] it must have been on that day when God
[1:47:05] would just come down in the cool of the
[1:47:08] evening and call at him and he and he
[1:47:11] would come up and they would worship God
[1:47:13] and they would fellowship and commune
[1:47:15] one with another you see because God
[1:47:17] longed for Fellowship amen there in the
[1:47:20] beginning God had a desire to have
[1:47:22] fellowship and and and and all these
[1:47:25] attributes was in God see and and and
[1:47:28] and God first created angels and and the
[1:47:31] angels was created for the purpose of
[1:47:33] worshiping him but yet even in that amen
[1:47:36] there was there was a desire that was in
[1:47:39] God that the Angels could not fulfill
[1:47:41] the Angels amen because God longed to
[1:47:44] have fellowship with a family see God
[1:47:47] didn't just want to uh create the angels
[1:47:50] and and the angels you know they they
[1:47:52] have their part and and they were
[1:47:54] created for the purpose to worship God
[1:47:56] and and actually brother Brandon would
[1:47:58] say before the Angels were were that God
[1:48:00] was not even God uh uh in the according
[1:48:04] to the definition of what uh uh of the
[1:48:06] word because God is an object of worship
[1:48:09] right amen but yet he was God
[1:48:11] potentially because all the potentials
[1:48:14] of everything God would ever be was
[1:48:16] already in him at that time and brother
[1:48:19] Brown said but he dwelt along there amen
[1:48:21] with his thoughts or his attributes amen
[1:48:25] but but yet all these desires was in God
[1:48:28] a desire to have a family and brother R
[1:48:31] said he wanted to have Fellowship Amen
[1:48:33] in the in in the adoption series he's
[1:48:36] talks about it how that God was he was
[1:48:38] first there uh known as Elohim the
[1:48:41] self-existing one see he was the all
[1:48:43] powerful uh uh all existence that ever
[1:48:46] was the self-existing one Elohim amen
[1:48:49] all sufficient off power Almighty
[1:48:51] self-existence see but in Genesis 2 when
[1:48:54] he made man he said I'm Jehovah and what
[1:48:57] did it mean I'm the all existing one who
[1:49:00] has created something off of myself to
[1:49:03] be a son see or an amateur little one of
[1:49:06] mine amen Oh Glory he said he gave a man
[1:49:10] Jehovah means that he gave man to be an
[1:49:13] amateure God because God is Father God
[1:49:16] and he made a man to an amateur God so
[1:49:19] he is isn't self-existent anymore he
[1:49:22] exists now with his family amen God made
[1:49:26] a man to be dominant over all the Earth
[1:49:28] he had dominion and the Earth was man's
[1:49:30] Dominion is that the scripture then if
[1:49:33] that's his Dominion he was the god over
[1:49:35] the Earth he could speak and it would be
[1:49:37] so he could speak this and it would be
[1:49:40] so and there he is god Jehovah the one
[1:49:43] who existed amen but now exists with his
[1:49:46] family his little ones amen and so you
[1:49:50] you see that God longed to have a family
[1:49:53] God wanted children he wanted somebody
[1:49:56] that he could share his glory with that
[1:49:58] that someone someone that you know and
[1:50:01] you see this expressed even Jesus
[1:50:03] expressed this desire of Fellowship
[1:50:06] there in John 17 John 17 when he's
[1:50:09] praying now to the father he says father
[1:50:11] I will that they also whom thou has
[1:50:13] given me be with me where I am see that
[1:50:17] they may behold my glory which thou has
[1:50:19] given me for thou has loved me before
[1:50:22] the foundation of the world and brother
[1:50:23] Brown picks that up in things that are
[1:50:25] to be and he said Jesus only asked for
[1:50:27] one thing in his prayer to the father
[1:50:29] and you know what it was the one thing
[1:50:31] after all the sacrifice that he did here
[1:50:33] on Earth and the life that he lived and
[1:50:35] the path that he walked he asked for one
[1:50:37] thing that where I am they may be also
[1:50:40] SE see he asked for our fellowship amen
[1:50:44] that's the only thing that he asked the
[1:50:46] father in prayer was your companionship
[1:50:48] forever amen and if you want to read it
[1:50:51] it's John 17 the 24th verse and how much
[1:50:54] more than we should we desire him see I
[1:50:58] if he had that desire for us amen how
[1:51:01] much more should we desire him see if
[1:51:03] you're really born of the spirit of God
[1:51:05] that just means everything to you it
[1:51:07] ain't some Book of Rules amen you don't
[1:51:10] live by any laws and so forth amen you
[1:51:13] live by the grace of God by the spirit
[1:51:16] of God and I want to tell you this
[1:51:17] tonight as a young people this message
[1:51:19] ain't bunch of rules you might look at
[1:51:21] it and think well that's really hard and
[1:51:23] you know we can't go here and we can't
[1:51:25] do that and we can't do that listen
[1:51:27] friends this message is not a bunch of
[1:51:28] rules when you when you really come into
[1:51:30] that fellowship with God Amen it's not a
[1:51:34] a legalism amen It's A Love
[1:51:37] Affair amen a a and you want to please
[1:51:40] him because he amen because you have a
[1:51:43] revelation amen of what he's done for
[1:51:45] you see amen and I tell you this when
[1:51:47] you come into that love affair when that
[1:51:49] Rel relationship and fellowship with God
[1:51:52] Amen then you'll find out that that will
[1:51:54] do what legalism has always failed to do
[1:51:57] amen because you can never Force
[1:51:59] somebody to be a Christian or or or or
[1:52:02] or to live an overcoming life that don't
[1:52:04] come that way listen friend the only way
[1:52:06] that you're going to overcome in Satan's
[1:52:07] edting is you got to get the Overcomer
[1:52:09] in your in your heart amen he's got to
[1:52:12] do it in you is that right and so as we
[1:52:15] look at this we know that there in the
[1:52:18] Garden of Eden that was God's
[1:52:20] Masterpiece it was his Masterpiece
[1:52:22] family and brother BR we talk about it
[1:52:25] and how that he that as a great sculptor
[1:52:28] he he begin to build and he said he
[1:52:30] would start you know uh uh brother
[1:52:33] Brandon would teach us the correct uh
[1:52:36] you know uh evolution is is is not uh
[1:52:39] you know what they're teaching out here
[1:52:41] in the schools today but it was by
[1:52:43] creation see and God would start with
[1:52:46] the botney life and so forth and come up
[1:52:48] to a higher form of creation he brought
[1:52:51] it into the animals and but he but but
[1:52:54] but yet God was longing to create
[1:52:57] something that would reflect him see
[1:53:00] amen he wanted to create something that
[1:53:02] was in His image and in his likeness
[1:53:05] amen and and and man when he created man
[1:53:08] in the image and the likeness of God
[1:53:10] that was a reflection now of the Creator
[1:53:13] himself and brother Brandon would say
[1:53:15] that it was a masterpiece family and
[1:53:17] when or or or uh that was God's
[1:53:19] Masterpiece rather when he created man
[1:53:22] that was God's Masterpiece he said but
[1:53:25] yet even in that he said there was
[1:53:27] something that was was was missing there
[1:53:29] there was a there was a longing that was
[1:53:32] even uh in Adam see Adam was now going
[1:53:35] to reflect the very Heart Of God because
[1:53:38] when when when uh God looked at Adam he
[1:53:41] said it ain't good that he should be
[1:53:43] alone see he it's not good that he
[1:53:46] should be even though he's a he's in my
[1:53:49] image and created in my likeness and so
[1:53:52] forth but yet there's something that
[1:53:54] that that's missing in this picture it's
[1:53:56] not good that he should be alone amen
[1:53:59] but so what did God do he didn't take a
[1:54:02] separate uh uh handful of dust and
[1:54:05] create a a a helpmate for Adam but he
[1:54:09] actually according to the scripture caus
[1:54:11] a deep sleep upon Adam and he took out
[1:54:13] of his own side see and created from his
[1:54:16] own side a
[1:54:18] helpmate amen and and and and that was
[1:54:22] that was the fulfilling of the desire
[1:54:25] that was God was reflecting through his
[1:54:28] Creation The Very desire that he had
[1:54:30] because God longed to have a bride seek
[1:54:33] amen God longed to have somebody because
[1:54:36] out of all the animal kingdom that was
[1:54:37] brought before Adam there in in the
[1:54:39] Garden of Eden Adam gave them all their
[1:54:41] names but yet in all of that creation
[1:54:44] there was nothing that was found that
[1:54:46] could be a helpmate to Adam there there
[1:54:48] was nothing that Adam might have loved
[1:54:50] the animals and I'm no doubt he did he
[1:54:51] may have loved the horses or the or the
[1:54:54] the lion or whatever more and that could
[1:54:58] be a great thing that he could you know
[1:55:01] uh uh uh uh have dominion over there in
[1:55:04] the garden and he had Out full control
[1:55:05] and dominion over and he gave them all
[1:55:07] their names but yet all out of all of
[1:55:09] that there was nothing found there that
[1:55:11] could fulfill the desire that was in his
[1:55:14] heart to have companionship and and and
[1:55:16] True Fellowship amen because listen to
[1:55:19] have True Fellowship you got to have
[1:55:21] something in common to have True
[1:55:24] Fellowship amen listen Kings fellowship
[1:55:27] with Kings is that right amen uh uh uh
[1:55:30] lowly amen the the poers fellowship
[1:55:33] listen friends poor people fellowship
[1:55:35] with poor people amen you know why
[1:55:37] because they got something in common
[1:55:39] amen they know amen they know the
[1:55:41] struggles and they amen they understand
[1:55:43] one another why because they got
[1:55:45] something in common and listen and
[1:55:47] that's why if God was going to have
[1:55:49] fellowship with somebody it would have
[1:55:51] to be somebody that was just like him
[1:55:55] amen am and the only way that God could
[1:55:58] have that is that that person had to
[1:56:00] come from the same
[1:56:02] origin amen it would have to come from
[1:56:05] the same place amen by the same
[1:56:08] creation amen and so we see that this is
[1:56:12] all being reflected through uh uh uh the
[1:56:15] the Masterpiece family that God and
[1:56:18] brother said when God created uh
[1:56:20] finished his Masterpiece then he took it
[1:56:22] and he put it on display in the Garden
[1:56:24] of Eden and
[1:56:26] so that's when Satan slipped
[1:56:31] in see and brother Bram said he marred
[1:56:34] the
[1:56:35] Masterpiece you know what happened
[1:56:38] because brother Brown said when it was
[1:56:39] all finished and he put his family there
[1:56:42] in the garden he said they were
[1:56:44] fortified behind the word of God and I
[1:56:47] just want to tell you this this brother
[1:56:50] brother Brandon would say something and
[1:56:52] I think it's so powerful he said God
[1:56:54] gave them the very best thing that he
[1:56:56] could have ever given them for
[1:56:59] protection and that was the word of
[1:57:02] God and brother bam said you can't
[1:57:05] improve upon it he said it's perfect you
[1:57:08] can't you can't make improvements upon
[1:57:10] the word of God Amen because it's
[1:57:12] perfect and let me tell you God's word
[1:57:15] still today is the best
[1:57:17] fortification that you could ever stand
[1:57:19] behind amen and Satan couldn't even get
[1:57:22] to Eve as long as she stayed behind that
[1:57:25] word and but but what did she do she
[1:57:28] stopped long enough to listen to the LIE
[1:57:31] of Satan amen and she stepped out
[1:57:33] brother Bron would say it this way she
[1:57:35] stepped out from behind the walls of the
[1:57:37] fortification of the word amen the best
[1:57:39] thing that God could ever give you he
[1:57:42] has given to you amen and your
[1:57:44] fortification is the word of God and as
[1:57:47] long as you stay under that word behind
[1:57:49] that word and stay fortified by that
[1:57:52] word listen for it don't need improved
[1:57:54] upon amen we don't need to improve upon
[1:57:57] the word but I tell you what brother
[1:57:58] Brown said he said you can't improve it
[1:58:00] he said but God can make it more real to
[1:58:02] you amen how many want to say tonight
[1:58:05] Lord make your word more real to me amen
[1:58:08] by the revelation of the holy spirit
[1:58:10] amen let the spirit of God take the word
[1:58:12] of make it more real in my life amen
[1:58:15] amen that's what I desire because that's
[1:58:17] our fortification amen but Eve see she
[1:58:20] stepped out from behind that
[1:58:21] fortification Satan slips in the the
[1:58:24] Masterpiece is marred amen but brother B
[1:58:27] said but God would not leave it laying
[1:58:29] in that condition amen when when even
[1:58:32] there in the fall in the Garden of Eden
[1:58:34] when man fa there amen listen God
[1:58:37] determined right there he said I'll not
[1:58:40] leave it in this condition he said but
[1:58:42] immediately he begin to work to rebuild
[1:58:45] it again amen amen but see what was was
[1:58:49] it that broke that Fellowship what did
[1:58:51] Adam really lose what what did Adam
[1:58:53] really lose he didn't lose a piece of
[1:58:56] just a piece of ground only see amen
[1:58:59] what did what did Adam lose he lost
[1:59:01] inheritance he lost his his Divine
[1:59:05] Fellowship amen that's what Adam really
[1:59:07] lost Amen in the fall amen and what
[1:59:10] broke that Fellowship was Sin Sin broke
[1:59:14] the fellowship listen the prophet said
[1:59:16] since sin broke the fellowship man has
[1:59:18] been tossed about from every wind of
[1:59:20] Doctrine and he's still tossed about
[1:59:22] he's turned he was turned out of the
[1:59:24] Garden of Eden to shift for himself and
[1:59:27] then that great time see from that time
[1:59:29] he's still tossing about amen amen why
[1:59:32] because sin broke the fellowship and let
[1:59:35] me just say this tonight sin will still
[1:59:37] break the
[1:59:38] fellowship amen if you if you ever come
[1:59:41] into fellowship with God I tell you this
[1:59:43] when sin comes in the picture it'll
[1:59:45] still break the fellowship amen because
[1:59:48] God cannot fellowship with sin I'll
[1:59:51] prove it to you by the scripture 2
[1:59:52] Corinthians 6 and4 Paul writes and says
[1:59:55] be ye not unequally yolked together now
[1:59:59] this is a great opportunity for me to to
[2:00:01] to to speak to you on this because a lot
[2:00:04] of you are are either searching now or
[2:00:07] you will be soon or amen and you're
[2:00:09] looking for somebody to share your life
[2:00:11] with to have companionship with to to to
[2:00:14] to to be a maid and and listen amen Paul
[2:00:17] is laying out a principle in the word of
[2:00:19] God don't be unequally yolked
[2:00:22] together a Believer should never under
[2:00:25] any circumstances marry an
[2:00:27] unbeliever amen can you agree with that
[2:00:31] amen why I'll tell you this you're going
[2:00:32] to have trouble down the road there's
[2:00:35] going to be a lot of problem that will
[2:00:37] not be an Eden that will not be an Eden
[2:00:39] marriage because you're trying to uh
[2:00:43] make light fellowship with
[2:00:46] Darkness brother uh uh Paul brother Paul
[2:00:51] said that it'll never work see he said
[2:00:54] for what Fellowship has righteousness
[2:00:57] with
[2:00:58] unrighteousness what Comm what communion
[2:01:00] has light with Darkness
[2:01:03] see so the only way to restore the
[2:01:06] fellowship is to remove the sin if sin
[2:01:10] broke the fellowship the only way to get
[2:01:13] the fellowship back is we'd have to
[2:01:15] remove the sin is that right and watch
[2:01:18] cuz brother B would say this in God's
[2:01:20] power to transform I think this is a
[2:01:22] beautiful statement he says the first
[2:01:25] man was in in the image of God which is
[2:01:27] a spirit John 4 says God is a spirit and
[2:01:30] they that worship Him must worship Him
[2:01:33] in spirit and in truth and God is a
[2:01:35] spirit and the first man that he created
[2:01:37] was a spirit man and he was in the image
[2:01:40] in the likeness of God and then he put
[2:01:43] his this man in flesh and
[2:01:46] man uh and man fell
[2:01:49] so then God came down and become in the
[2:01:52] image of man that he might redeem that
[2:01:55] Fallen man see that's the real gospel
[2:01:59] story to my opinion brother Bram that's
[2:02:02] what brother BR said that's the real
[2:02:04] gospel story to my opinion Man was
[2:02:06] created in the image of God but then
[2:02:09] that man was put in flesh he fell in
[2:02:12] that condition see so then God comes
[2:02:14] down in the image of man to redeem that
[2:02:17] Fallen man back to his original
[2:02:20] condition listen friends I want to just
[2:02:22] tell you young people this God has sent
[2:02:24] us a message in this evening time how
[2:02:27] many is thankful for the message of the
[2:02:29] hour and God has sent us this message
[2:02:31] and this message is a message of
[2:02:34] restoration amen and what is a message
[2:02:36] of restoration to do is to bring us back
[2:02:39] to our ought toe condition to what we
[2:02:42] was created to be in the beginning
[2:02:45] listen friends amen God never created us
[2:02:47] to be in a fallen condition condition to
[2:02:49] be ruled by sin and sin desire and amen
[2:02:53] to be to live a a defeated lives amen
[2:02:56] God did not create us Amen to be in that
[2:02:59] condition he created us Amen to to have
[2:03:02] dominion Amen to to to be
[2:03:06] Overcomers Amen to to have fellowship
[2:03:08] with him he created us to be his
[2:03:11] children Sons and Daughters of God to
[2:03:12] believe the word of God to live the word
[2:03:15] of God Amen to to live a Victorious Life
[2:03:19] amen and God has now sent a message in
[2:03:21] this last day to bring us back to our
[2:03:23] all to be
[2:03:25] condition some message of
[2:03:27] restoration and so that's the real
[2:03:29] gospel story the prophet of God said and
[2:03:32] watch because he would he would say in
[2:03:34] God's provided way or of of approach to
[2:03:37] Fellowship he said did you notice as
[2:03:39] soon as a man as soon as man falls and
[2:03:42] he's F he finds that he has fallen and
[2:03:45] he's a sinner by Nature he tries to make
[2:03:48] himself a way to approach God see He
[2:03:52] makes himself a religion well I I I
[2:03:54] don't want to do no harm or I just feel
[2:03:57] I'm just as good as any other man or
[2:03:59] I'll keep the Golden Rule see that
[2:04:01] wasn't God's program in order to restore
[2:04:04] Fellowship again God made a provision
[2:04:06] right there in the garden and if there
[2:04:08] would have been any other provision
[2:04:10] better God would have made it but God
[2:04:13] made the only provision the only basis
[2:04:15] of restoration Amen to that blessed
[2:04:18] eternal Fellowship that was through the
[2:04:20] blood of an innocent victim see and God
[2:04:23] made a way back to fellowship and that's
[2:04:25] the only basis that God ever had or or
[2:04:28] has now or ever will have back to a
[2:04:31] relationship and fellowship with God is
[2:04:34] through the shed blood of an innocent
[2:04:36] one and see brother B said that just
[2:04:39] makes me feel religious knowing that
[2:04:42] there is a way amen there is a way there
[2:04:45] is a God provided way listen friends I
[2:04:48] ought to make make us all feel religious
[2:04:49] tonight amen because we can all see amen
[2:04:53] that there's been a fall we can all see
[2:04:55] that the that the world is not in its
[2:04:57] ought to be condition we can all see
[2:05:00] that amen that that we're not in the
[2:05:02] Garden of Eden currently living on this
[2:05:04] Earth in a in an Eden condition we can
[2:05:06] all see that amen but what ought to
[2:05:09] really give us courage and and make us
[2:05:11] rejoice this evening is that God has
[2:05:13] made a way back amen we can all see that
[2:05:17] there was a separation but we to be
[2:05:19] thankful that God Amen has made a way
[2:05:21] back he's made a way to restore the
[2:05:24] fellowship amen there and brother Brown
[2:05:27] said there's been many substitutes tried
[2:05:29] Adam tried it we've tried to educate
[2:05:31] people to it we've tried all different
[2:05:33] forms but there's nothing that brings a
[2:05:35] man back into fellowship with his maker
[2:05:37] but the blood of his son Jesus Christ
[2:05:39] it's the
[2:05:40] only appro uh approach God has is the
[2:05:44] blood an innocent victim died for a
[2:05:46] guilty person SE that brought the
[2:05:48] Fellowship back to God and man again and
[2:05:50] then Adam covered by the blood could
[2:05:52] stand in the presence of God and worship
[2:05:54] he said oh I love that there's something
[2:05:56] about it when you speak of the blood the
[2:05:58] blood has life listen friends it's not
[2:06:01] uh the chemistry brother R would teach
[2:06:03] us in the token it's not that what is
[2:06:05] the what is the blood today the blood
[2:06:07] today to us is the holy spirit amen it's
[2:06:11] the life that was in that blood amen
[2:06:13] that's the the the overcoming power
[2:06:15] that's the way back to God Amen you
[2:06:18] can't get it by joining a church you
[2:06:20] can't get it by uh reciting the Apostles
[2:06:23] Creed you can't get it by putting your
[2:06:25] name on a book you you're not going to
[2:06:27] get it by memorizing scripture or
[2:06:29] memorizing come on listen amen there
[2:06:31] ain't but one thing there's only one way
[2:06:33] back amen and that's by a new birth amen
[2:06:37] that's by the true baptism of the Holy
[2:06:39] Ghost there's no substitute to it
[2:06:42] there's no other way there's no other
[2:06:44] way to have fellowship with God except
[2:06:46] by the spirit of God and by
[2:06:49] a rebirth amen by being regenerated amen
[2:06:54] you got to be born the second time the
[2:06:56] way you should have been born the first
[2:06:57] time amen God has made a way friends
[2:07:00] amen that we could be born amen
[2:07:06] again yes sir and that's the way back
[2:07:09] see brother B said
[2:07:12] see Adam couldn't meet the the
[2:07:15] requirements of
[2:07:16] redemption he couldn't do it
[2:07:19] because he himself needed
[2:07:21] Redemption is that right but brother
[2:07:24] Bram said that the law demanded a
[2:07:26] kinsman
[2:07:27] redeemer the law demanded it God's Own
[2:07:30] law demanded a kinsman redeemer Amen in
[2:07:33] other words God couldn't come down as as
[2:07:36] just the logos and and redeem you am
[2:07:40] because listen God because man fell in
[2:07:43] the flesh man didn't fall in the spirit
[2:07:45] he fell in the flesh and so God had to
[2:07:48] come down as brother Brown said in the
[2:07:50] form of man amen for the purpose of
[2:07:53] redemption Amen to to to redeem us back
[2:07:57] Amen to what was lost in the Garden of
[2:07:59] Eden amen he said the law demanded it
[2:08:02] but Grace amen Grace met its
[2:08:06] requirements in the person of the Lord
[2:08:08] Jesus Christ and brother BR said love
[2:08:10] constrained him to do it amen amen love
[2:08:13] constrained him to do it amen the grace
[2:08:15] of God Amen the love of God constrained
[2:08:18] him to to make a way back amen for you
[2:08:20] and I amen that we could go back Amen to
[2:08:23] what was all that Adam lost there in the
[2:08:27] garden brother bam said in the message
[2:08:29] of Grace he said Grace is old Grace is
[2:08:32] as old as the world is Grace was first
[2:08:34] known to the human race at there in the
[2:08:36] beginning of the human race when when
[2:08:38] when it was first created in the Garden
[2:08:40] of Eden and on that dark morning when
[2:08:42] the little woman had stepped across a
[2:08:44] separating line and gone against God's
[2:08:46] Commandments and enticed her husband to
[2:08:48] do the same thing the law was broken the
[2:08:50] law must have a penalty or it isn't a
[2:08:52] law no more see the law was the day you
[2:08:55] eat thereof that day you shall surely
[2:08:57] die and remember the first judgment seat
[2:08:59] was upon the Earth it was there in the
[2:09:01] Garden of Eden and the last judgment
[2:09:02] seat will be upon the Earth at the end
[2:09:05] time at the white Throne he said but
[2:09:07] when Jehovah come down I could just
[2:09:08] imagine there wasn't even a star to
[2:09:10] shine it was so dark that the light the
[2:09:13] little light uh the uh the little garden
[2:09:17] there that was once
[2:09:18] uh so beautiful because sin had blotted
[2:09:21] out the light see watch what he said had
[2:09:23] taken the light from among them and
[2:09:25] that's what's to matter with the
[2:09:26] churches today that's what's a matter
[2:09:28] with people today sin has blotted out
[2:09:31] the light of the Living God Amen to show
[2:09:34] that Christ is still the same yesterday
[2:09:36] today and forever and that he still
[2:09:37] lives to save the uttermost and to heal
[2:09:40] the lowest and and every sick person
[2:09:42] amen why can't people see that because
[2:09:44] sin has blotted out the light of God and
[2:09:47] brother Brown said what a dark day that
[2:09:48] was how terrible it was that morning
[2:09:50] Darkness hanging there in the garden and
[2:09:52] I imagine that the fog of the black
[2:09:55] sackcloth was I imagine every leaf no
[2:09:58] even moved amen there was no wind
[2:10:00] stirring it was just darkness and
[2:10:02] terrible because sin had blotted it out
[2:10:05] and then there come Jehovah down like a
[2:10:08] roar of Thunder walking through the
[2:10:10] garden crying Adam Adam Where Art Thou
[2:10:13] and that's when Adam realized that he
[2:10:15] was naked and that he had sinned before
[2:10:17] God and he HD him self and tried to make
[2:10:19] himself a religion but it didn't work
[2:10:21] amen but what did God do he killed some
[2:10:23] sheep and he took the skins and show
[2:10:26] that something had to die to cover sin
[2:10:29] amen joining church will never cover sin
[2:10:31] no dried confession will ever cover sin
[2:10:34] it takes sorrow and repentance and the
[2:10:37] grace of God to cover sin amen amen see
[2:10:41] amen that's what it takes amen the blood
[2:10:43] of Jesus Christ the one that God killed
[2:10:45] on Calvary to cover sin and there in the
[2:10:48] Garden that morning when sin was so
[2:10:49] black Jehovah come in and there stood
[2:10:52] his couple standing there condemned
[2:10:54] there would be no more human race they
[2:10:55] had to D SE death it was death there
[2:10:59] amen death of the human race to give the
[2:11:01] world back to the wild beast and there
[2:11:03] there would be no more human race but in
[2:11:06] that darkness in that hour of darkness
[2:11:08] in that time when all hope was gone
[2:11:11] Grace come pouring through amen he said
[2:11:14] I'll give you a savior I'll give you a
[2:11:16] messiah amen oh so wonder how God would
[2:11:19] ever do it but it was God's Amazing
[2:11:21] Grace in the Garden of Eden that gave
[2:11:23] them a promise of a just one who would
[2:11:25] come through the woman the woman's seed
[2:11:27] and he shall bruise the Serpent's head
[2:11:29] the guilty one amen and his head shall
[2:11:31] bruise her heel to show that there would
[2:11:33] be Affliction in the church but he
[2:11:35] promised a Triumph amen what provided a
[2:11:37] savior Grace provided a savior amen I
[2:11:41] can just think about how brother Brandon
[2:11:43] would talk about uh there many times we
[2:11:45] would say maybe that brother Brandon
[2:11:47] would dramatize it out but I just heard
[2:11:49] him say the other day that while I was
[2:11:51] preaching I broke into a vision could
[2:11:53] you imagine brother I tell you amen
[2:11:55] sometimes we think maybe brother BR was
[2:11:57] just dramatizing something out but
[2:11:59] sometimes he was literally seeing a
[2:12:02] vision he was seeing what was happening
[2:12:05] and I can hear and say I broke into a
[2:12:06] vision brother BR would say I see Adam
[2:12:09] and Eve walking out of the garden he
[2:12:11] said I see Eve laying her head over on
[2:12:14] Adam's shoulders he said I can hear
[2:12:16] something he said it's teardrops
[2:12:18] dropping down to the leaves he said I
[2:12:21] can hear the sound he said they're
[2:12:23] crying now they're mortal now amen
[2:12:25] listen they was experiencing emotions
[2:12:29] that they had never experienced before
[2:12:31] amen they were experiencing sorrow and
[2:12:35] fear and and and all these things that
[2:12:37] they had never experienced before and
[2:12:39] here they are walking out of the garden
[2:12:40] and brother bam was said I see them
[2:12:42] walking out of the garden he said I can
[2:12:43] hear the the the the skin of the Lamb
[2:12:46] beating against Adam's legs
[2:12:48] amen but but then he said I hear a roar
[2:12:51] thundering through the garden amen
[2:12:54] listen Adam and Eve is walking out with
[2:12:56] no hope but all of a sudden the voice of
[2:12:59] God Thunders through the garden and he
[2:13:01] says wait a minute amen I'll Make A Way
[2:13:04] Back Hallelujah I'll make a way of
[2:13:08] Salvation amen I will point a
[2:13:12] seed amen I'm going to defeat the enemy
[2:13:16] I'm going to make a way back and brother
[2:13:18] Bron would say oh amen but I hear
[2:13:20] another sound amen and maybe I could
[2:13:23] just maybe dramatize a little bit
[2:13:24] tonight amen I can I can see that I can
[2:13:27] hear the prophets saying those things
[2:13:29] and I begin to to catch a vision of of
[2:13:32] Adam and Eve walking out of the garden
[2:13:34] there amen tears are falling off of
[2:13:36] their their faces now amen they're
[2:13:39] they're mortal now and all the emotions

[2:14:21] man amen but he come as a baby and he

[2:19:47] said he fell into camp with a message he
[2:19:49] said that was a great Dove but old
[2:19:51] brother Isaiah 53 tells us of one that
[2:19:54] came down from home and all that was
[2:19:56] good and he was wounded for our
[2:19:58] transgression he was bruised for our
[2:20:00] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[2:20:03] was upon him and with his stripes we
[2:20:05] were healed sickness and Superstition

[2:21:02] poet Cried Out mid rendering rocks and
[2:21:05] darkening Skies My Savior bowed his head
[2:21:07] and died but opening the veil revealed
[2:21:10] the way to Heaven's Joy an endless day

[2:21:16] through
[2:21:18] amen I say the message got through amen
[2:21:20] a way has been made back brother Ram

[2:21:26] risen from the dead that morning and he
[2:21:28] had on his he had his own blood as a
[2:21:31] high priest and he went beyond the veils

[2:21:38] times past had blocked off Heaven he
[2:21:42] could he he man man could not contact
[2:21:45] with heaven but when Jesus took his
[2:21:47] blood the first Veil he rent was the
[2:21:49] veil of death the veil of the Grave the
[2:21:51] veil of the temple the veil of sickness
[2:21:53] the veil of fear every Veil that there
[2:21:56] was amen the unveiled God to man amen

[2:22:05] right amen and all above and there he
[2:22:08] opened up the
[2:22:10] channel that God used to come down
[2:22:13] through the corridors of heaven and talk
[2:22:16] with Mankind in the Garden of Eden and
[2:22:18] Satan by sin had blocked them off but
[2:22:20] what a great high priest with his
[2:22:22] anointing with the blood went through
[2:22:24] every Veil and ripped her open and
[2:22:26] cleared out the skies again that God and
[2:22:29] man could be father and son and could
[2:22:31] commune with one another oh what a
[2:22:33] marvelous thing think about this amen
[2:22:35] when Jesus died listen for he not only

[2:28:17] a in a meeting like this in our church
[2:28:19] services amen he said with no
[2:28:21] differences among us he said oh that's
[2:28:23] like the fellowship they had in the

[2:28:51] sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts
[2:28:53] you you don't accept it it accepts you
[2:28:55] because it's God's attribute it's the
[2:28:57] holy ghost means God's spirit the
[2:28:59] attribute the thought of God has
[2:29:01] accepted you because you were ordained
[2:29:03] for that purpose see yet you were born
[2:29:05] in sin but God had that attribute and
[2:29:09] here you are expressed Amen on the earth

[2:29:45] brother BR the Church a book said it's a
[2:29:47] prepared place for a prepared people

[2:30:21] you I find this that the greatest power
[2:30:25] there is in the world is not the atomic
[2:30:29] bomb but a believer in contact with his
[2:30:34] maker it changes the whole attitude it
[2:30:37] changes his mental it changes his habits

[2:30:43] nature it changes everything a believer

[2:30:50] maker see Adam never had to be sick he
[2:30:53] never had to die he never had to worry
[2:30:55] he he he never had to have a heart
[2:30:57] heartache he never had to fear he just
