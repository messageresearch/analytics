[27:18] Winter's family. And I think of the, you

[27:27] know, the faith that was in your
[27:29] grandmother Lois and also in your mother
[27:33] Ununice is also in thee. And I I tell
[27:37] you, you know, I I don't think we can
[27:39] kind of hand it down physically, but I
[27:43] do believe that we can provide an
[27:45] atmosphere where young people can be
[27:47] raised in the admonition of the Lord and
[27:50] and be blessed. And I'll tell you what,
[27:53] we have that opportunity right here. And
[27:56] I want to thank you as a group of people
[27:57] for being a support to young uh families
[28:01] and these little children. And may the
[28:04] Lord's blessings be upon this this

[28:28] grace. and they made their profession
[28:31] and confession upon you. And it's on
[28:34] that solid rock that they build their
[28:36] faith. Now, Lord, on this Father's Day,
[28:41] we bring this little tribute of your
[28:43] grace, Lord, to you and place it in your
[28:47] arms, Lord, this this precious love
[28:50] gift. Now, Father, may in the name of
[28:52] Jesus, the angel of God, go with this
[28:55] child all the days of its life. And

[37:36] God.
[37:46] Hallelujah.
[37:48] How many thankful he's still God?
[37:51] Amen.
[37:53] Amen. So thankful for that. That no
[37:57] matter what we're going through, no
[37:58] matter what the situations are, doesn't
[38:01] change who he is. That's that's a lot of
[38:04] courage you can have in that because you
[38:06] get in a lot of tight spots sometimes
[38:08] and sometimes you wonder who you are but
[38:10] that doesn't change who he is. Amen.
[38:14] Because of who you are, I give you
[38:16] glory. Because of who you are,
[38:21] I give you glory.
[38:27] Oh, because of who you are,
[38:31] I give you praise.
[38:38] Because of who you are,
[38:42] I will lift my voice and say,
[38:47] Lord, I worship you because of who you
[38:53] are.
[38:57] Lord, I worship you because of who you
[39:03] are. Because of who you are.
[39:08] Oh, because of who you are.

[41:09] who you are.

[41:18] you are.

[42:01] who you are.
[42:04] Jehovah,

[42:11] are my provider.
[42:14] Oh
[42:16] Lord, you reign in victory
[42:21] over Shalom.

[42:30] worship you.

[42:48] You are my provider.
[42:53] Jehovah na.
[42:56] Thank you Jesus.
[42:59] You reign in victory.
[43:04] Oh yes,
[43:06] my prince of peace.
[43:09] And I worship you because of who you
[43:14] are.
[43:17] Yes, I worship you because of Sing that
[43:23] again. Because of who you are.
[43:26] And because of who you are.
[43:35] Because of who you are,
[43:40] I give you praise
[43:45] because of who you are.
[43:48] Oh, I lift my voice and I worship you.
[43:55] Oh, yes I do, Lord.
[44:00] And I worship you because of who you
[44:05] are.
[44:09] I feel
[44:10] the poor.
[44:16] Oh, I hear
[44:19] the call
[44:24] and I know your spirit
[44:29] is moving me.
[44:33] Oh, I will give my all.
[44:38] He speaks
[44:40] to me.
[44:45] Oh, and I
[44:51] [Music]
[44:53] Oh, Lord, please come and take
[44:59] control.
[45:00] I feel
[45:03] the poor. I feel the poor.
[45:07] I feel
[45:10] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[45:12] Oh, I hear you, Lord.
[45:16] I hear the call.
[45:22] And I know his spirit
[45:26] is moving me.
[45:30] Oh, I'm going to give my all.
[45:36] He speaks
[45:38] to me.
[45:42] Oh, and I
[45:45] agree.
[45:49] Oh, Lord, please come
[45:53] and take control.
[45:56] I feel the P.
[45:59] At night, I lay in bed.
[46:03] At night, I lay in bed.
[46:08] And I
[46:11] begin to cry.
[46:17] Oh, and my mind just fails
[46:22] to know
[46:24] exactly
[46:26] why.
[46:30] I can't explain
[46:33] with tongue or fear.
[46:37] The spirit's growing
[46:40] deep within.
[46:43] Oh, it must be God
[46:46] here in my soul. For I feel the cold.
[46:53] You feel that tug this morning. Oh, I
[46:56] feel
[46:58] I feel the poor
[47:02] and I hear
[47:04] the call.
[47:09] And I know his spirit's
[47:12] moving
[47:14] me. Oh, to give
[47:18] my all.
[47:22] He speaks to me
[47:28] and I agree.
[47:34] Oh Lord, please come and take control. I
[47:41] feel the
[47:47] I come to hear the word
[47:52] and with each light.
[48:00] Oh, he is calling me to him
[48:07] a higher praise.
[48:12] Oh, there's a need
[48:17] all to the deep like a great magn.
[48:25] Oh, I know for sure that I'll reach the
[48:30] goal. For I feel the pull. Let's stand
[48:35] together this morning. Oh, I feel the
[48:40] pull.
[48:41] Yes, Lord. Oh, I hear
[48:46] the call
[48:50] and I know his spirit.
[48:54] It's moving me.
[48:58] Oh, I'm going to give my all. He speaks
[49:04] to me.
[49:07] [Music]
[49:09] And I pray,
[49:15] Lord, please come and take control.
[49:21] I feel the
[49:26] Hallelujah. Aren't you glad that there's
[49:29] a deep calling to the deep
[49:32] that there's something in you that can
[49:34] respond to the great things of God and
[49:37] the blessings of the Lord. We are so
[49:40] blessed, so thankful to God for his
[49:42] goodness to us, his love and his mercies
[49:46] that endure to all generations.
[49:49] Amen. Good to see each one of you that
[49:51] is assembled here. And I see there's
[49:54] several ones that's coming in for
[49:55] Father's Day. And you know, u here to be
[49:59] a part with us today and with your
[50:01] fathers. We want to say we appreciate
[50:03] you being here together with us. If I
[50:06] start calling names, I'll miss somebody
[50:08] or forget somebody. And that'd be awful
[50:10] to stand here and forget your name,
[50:12] wouldn't it? So, I won't even start
[50:14] there. Um, we just want to say we're
[50:17] just glad to have each one of you that
[50:19] is here with us today. And may the
[50:21] presence of God be with you in a real
[50:24] and special way. You know, I I want to
[50:27] wish uh you all you brothers there
[50:31] uh happy father's day and um I thank God
[50:37] for real men, real men that love God and
[50:41] serve him. And we appreciate you. You
[50:44] mean a lot to us and what God has done
[50:47] in your life and the grace that he's
[50:48] shown is just nothing short of a
[50:51] miracle. You're some of the greatest
[50:53] miracles there is. Amen. Just to be a
[50:56] part of the body of Christ and to be
[50:58] called in this hour.
[51:01] I I want to just share something as we
[51:05] as we before we begin the ministry this
[51:08] morning. I want to just give a little
[51:10] tribute myself. Of course, I did have a
[51:14] wonderful natural father that God
[51:16] blessed me with.
[51:19] Did many wonderful things for me, and I
[51:21] thank God for for my parents.
[51:25] But today, I I want to just take an a
[51:29] little different avenue on that from
[51:33] natural fathers. And I want to just read
[51:36] from 1 Corinthians 4:14. He said, "I
[51:39] write not these things to shame you, but
[51:42] as my beloved sons, I warn you. For
[51:46] though you have 10,000 instructors in
[51:49] Christ, yet have ye not many fathers,
[51:53] for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you
[51:55] through the gospel. Wherefore I beseech
[51:58] you, be followers of me."
[52:02] And as I pause today to reflect on
[52:04] Father's Day, I'm I'm certainly filled
[52:07] with gratitude
[52:10] for the many men of God, my brothers,
[52:14] many of them my friends, personal
[52:17] acquaintances whose instructions I has
[52:19] shaped my life and ministry. Not all of
[52:22] these were even ministers, but just some
[52:25] of you brothers here have just been a
[52:27] blessing, a influence on my life. And
[52:30] over the years, I've gleaned from
[52:32] faithful servants, from godly men whose
[52:35] lives and teachings have truly left an
[52:39] indelible
[52:40] mark on me. And yet, while we have many
[52:44] instructors in Christ, we do not have
[52:46] many spiritual fathers. For me, there's
[52:50] no question as to who my father in the
[52:53] gospel is. I was birthed under the
[52:56] ministry of brother William Brham. his
[52:59] preaching, his life, his manner,
[53:02] everything about his ministry, it left a
[53:05] lasting imprint upon my soul. And from
[53:09] the earliest days of my youth, I
[53:11] witnessed firsthand the supernatural
[53:14] manifestation that followed his calling.
[53:17] And though I've seen others rise and
[53:19] make claims, I've never seen a ministry
[53:22] that even comes close to comparing to
[53:25] it. Not just even in the spiritual gifts
[53:29] which nothing ever came close because it
[53:32] was a vindicated sign but also in the re
[53:36] revelation of the word. I've never met
[53:39] another man or never heard of another
[53:41] man with the intense knowledge of
[53:45] revelation given to him by the Holy
[53:47] Spirit as what brother Brandham was. And
[53:50] brother Brandham was not merely a part
[53:53] of the five-fold ministry. He was more.
[53:56] He was the Elijah to our age, the
[53:58] seventh angel messenger spoken of in
[54:01] Revelation 3 and also Revelation 10:7.
[54:06] And his ministry was not just simply a a
[54:09] demonstration of the nine spiritual
[54:12] gifts, but it was truly the repeat, the
[54:16] return of the very ministry of Jesus
[54:19] Christ to this generation.
[54:21] and it was sent to vindicate the
[54:24] revealed word. For only the word himself
[54:27] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[54:28] intents of the heart.
[54:31] Most of you know I I grew up here in in
[54:34] the backwoods of Louisiana and without a
[54:38] without a local pastor to call my own.
[54:41] But I thank God that I was birthed under
[54:45] the sound of that end time message. I
[54:48] may not have had an earthly shepherd
[54:52] guiding me from the beginning, but I was
[54:54] begotten by the voice that echoed the
[54:57] very thoughts of God. And on this
[55:00] Father's Day, I want to express my
[55:04] deepest appreciation and reverence for
[55:07] this great man of God, Brother Brham, my
[55:10] father in the gospel. I honor the vessel
[55:13] that God used to bring me to Christ and
[55:16] anchor me in the revealed word of the
[55:18] hour. And we want to say today
[55:22] we our voice could really join with the
[55:25] the many thousands on the other side or
[55:28] millions he said who said if you had not
[55:31] have gone we would not be here. And
[55:34] certainly that's the truth today. And I
[55:37] want to just share a little quote for
[55:39] with from the voice of the sign. And he
[55:41] said, "Now we find out that the these
[55:44] men go out sometimes and people begin to
[55:47] press upon them. Oh brother, what will
[55:49] you say?" See, he goes by impression the
[55:53] way he feels. Why the Lord will do that?
[55:56] Thus sayeth the Lord. That's a lie. See,
[55:59] you can't say thus sayith the Lord until
[56:01] God in his own language has spoke to you
[56:03] and told you that. Then it's not you
[56:06] saying it. It's not your impression. The
[56:08] Bible said if a prophet did that was
[56:10] going on presumptuously that is
[56:12] presuming and to presume is to adventure
[56:15] without authority. He is going up on his
[56:18] own. But when you see the man speaking
[56:21] what's going to happen in the name of
[56:23] the Lord and it happens day in and out,
[56:27] week in and out, month in and out, year
[56:30] in and out. Then you know that came from
[56:32] God. That's God's credentials to the man
[56:37] that he is interpreter of the written
[56:39] word for that day because God sent the
[56:43] man to do it. And of course, that's
[56:47] exactly what we saw in the messenger
[56:50] that God sent us in this day. Let's just
[56:53] bow our heads in thanksgiving. Lord, we
[56:56] want to say thank you today on this
[56:59] Father's Day as we remember and give
[57:03] tribute to these men of God that stand
[57:06] before me today.
[57:09] Many of them now, some of them seniors,
[57:12] some of them maybe just have had their
[57:15] first child. Some are expecting one to
[57:17] come. Some are preparing for marriage or
[57:20] whatever that one day that they will be
[57:23] a father. Lord, they're men, their
[57:26] fathers in training, and we certainly
[57:28] want to give the right examples for them
[57:30] to follow. We want to thank you, Lord,
[57:33] for dedicated young men, Lord. Season
[57:37] old men, God, men that you've raised up
[57:41] in this generation to be a light, oh
[57:45] God, in this evening time. I pray your
[57:48] blessings upon your children today,
[57:51] Lord, as we thank you. We thank you for
[57:54] great men and I could call names of
[57:57] those who have of my brothers that has
[58:00] influenced my life and has left an
[58:02] indelible mark upon me. I want to thank
[58:05] you Lord. I am today made up of those
[58:08] many men, those many sermons and
[58:10] different things that I've heard and
[58:12] Lord things that they imparted to me. I
[58:15] thank you for those gifts. But Lord, we
[58:18] want to thank you Lord for a prophet
[58:21] that you sent in this generation. But
[58:23] Father, when we think about earthly men
[58:26] and even spiritual fathers that had
[58:30] influence upon us that were earthly men,
[58:33] oh God, it all pales to nothing in
[58:36] compared to you. You are our heavenly
[58:39] father and we love you and today we
[58:43] thank you. I can look around this
[58:45] congregation and say, "Brother, sister,"
[58:48] because we all come from the same
[58:51] source, the same father. I pray, Lord,
[58:54] your blessings upon each one today. And
[58:57] may you just draw near and accept our
[59:00] worship and our love and adoration to
[59:02] you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[59:07] you. Amen. Thank you. So appreciate the
[59:10] Lord. Will you turn with me to Matthew
[59:12] chapter 13:36?
[59:14] I am looking again at this end time
[59:17] scripture as we just explore more about
[59:22] uh what God is doing here in this last
[59:25] day harvest season. And I'm going to be
[59:27] speaking today on on the uh climax of
[59:31] the harvest. And of course, you know,
[59:33] we're going along with our theme of who
[59:35] art thou, oh great mountain, thou shalt
[59:38] become a plain, and the headstone shall
[59:40] be brought forth with shoutings, crying,
[59:42] grace, grace unto it. And and and of
[59:45] course, we are living in a day where a
[59:48] lot of grace has been poured out, the
[59:50] favor of God. And Jesus tells us and and
[59:55] gives us this prophecy and that at the
[59:59] end time there would be a harvest of all
[1:00:02] that has been planted whether it be the
[1:00:05] good seed or the seed of the wicked one.
[1:00:09] So Matthew 13:36 then Jesus sent the
[1:00:12] multitude away and went into the house
[1:00:14] and his disciples came to him saying
[1:00:17] declare unto us the parable of the tears
[1:00:19] of the field. And he answered and said
[1:00:20] of them, he that sawth the good seed is
[1:00:22] the son of man. The field is the world.
[1:00:25] The good seeds are the children of the
[1:00:27] kingdom, but the tears of the are the
[1:00:30] children of the wicked one. The enemy
[1:00:32] that swed them is the devil. The harvest
[1:00:35] is the end of the world. The reapers are
[1:00:37] the angels. And there as therefore the
[1:00:39] tears are gathered and burned in the
[1:00:41] fire, so shall it be in the end of the
[1:00:45] world. God bless you. Can be seated.
[1:00:49] Amen. Thank you for your prayers and
[1:00:52] your support here at the church while I
[1:00:54] was away. And I appreciate you um you
[1:00:58] know being prayerful about our meetings
[1:01:01] there in Ohio. And brother Ron and I
[1:01:03] ministered there. We had a wonderful
[1:01:05] time and was a had a gracious host. Our
[1:01:08] brother Wayne Lawson, brother Ray
[1:01:10] Ericson was very gracious to us. We want
[1:01:13] to express our appreciation for that
[1:01:15] this morning. So, thank you and God
[1:01:18] bless you. Now, going quickly into the
[1:01:20] scripture this morning, we we just want
[1:01:24] to remember that Jesus prophesied of the
[1:01:28] harvest at the end of the world in
[1:01:31] Matthew chapter 13. And we are here. And
[1:01:35] the field is the world, and the good
[1:01:37] seed are the children of the kingdom.
[1:01:40] And the harvest is the end of the world,
[1:01:41] and the reapers are the angels.
[1:01:45] And the son of man swed the seed. He was
[1:01:48] planting sons and daughters of the
[1:01:50] kingdom. I don't know if you know it or
[1:01:52] not, but you you the when that gospel
[1:01:55] was spread out, it was seeds and and
[1:01:58] those seeds were um that he was planting
[1:02:02] would come into fruition as sons and
[1:02:05] daughters of God. But of course we know
[1:02:07] that there is an enemy and that enemy
[1:02:11] swed terrors and they were false seed
[1:02:14] right along alongside them. And this is
[1:02:18] actually happened since Eden when two
[1:02:21] trees were planted side by side.
[1:02:23] And and this again happened once again
[1:02:26] just um in the same chapters of Genesis
[1:02:31] where where two seeds were planted in
[1:02:33] Eve's womb and grew together until each
[1:02:37] manifested who they were. And Jesus said
[1:02:41] he was sewing a seed for a crop and he
[1:02:46] foresaw that the wicked one would also
[1:02:48] sew a seed and they would grow together.
[1:02:52] But now at harvest time, the time of
[1:02:57] separation, you know, that the wheat and
[1:03:00] the tears would be would be both be
[1:03:02] gathered, one to the garner and the
[1:03:04] other to be burned. And this is what
[1:03:07] Revelation 14 uh 14 tells us. It says,
[1:03:12] "Behold, a white cloud upon and upon the
[1:03:15] cloud once sat like the son of man
[1:03:18] having upon his head a golden crown and
[1:03:21] in his hand a sharp sickle for the
[1:03:24] harvest of the earth is ripe." So we of
[1:03:29] course know who this son of man is and
[1:03:32] this is the one with the sickle. It is
[1:03:34] Jesus Christ. He is the lord of the
[1:03:38] harvest. You know, you can't have a
[1:03:40] harvest without the Lord of the harvest
[1:03:43] commanding it to be. And he has to be
[1:03:45] here. And and I want you to know he is
[1:03:47] here. That he is here descending as
[1:03:51] shown in Revelation chapter 10. And he's
[1:03:54] clothed with a cloud with an open book
[1:03:56] in his hand. And he is to he is to reap
[1:04:00] a bride, a people with the revealed
[1:04:04] word. And and and let me just assure you
[1:04:07] this is not just another revival. It's
[1:04:10] not another religious movement. It's not
[1:04:14] the rise of a new and different
[1:04:15] denomination. That's not who we are. Not
[1:04:19] no not another denomination with its
[1:04:22] creeds and dogmas. No sir, it's reaping.
[1:04:25] It is the son of man coming with a
[1:04:28] sickle and he's cutting mature grain
[1:04:32] from the field and and there he's
[1:04:34] gathering his elect from every kindred,
[1:04:36] nation, tongue, tribe, people and then
[1:04:39] and and and the wheat is being gathered
[1:04:42] into the garner and she is a bride, a
[1:04:46] perfect bride without spout or wrinkle.
[1:04:49] This is what God promised for this age.
[1:04:52] So what began 2,000 years ago at the
[1:04:56] initiating of redemption, you know, at
[1:04:59] the start of the church ages, what began
[1:05:02] at Pentecost is a seed now comes to
[1:05:05] maturity and quickened by the Holy
[1:05:08] Ghost. And this of course is the bride
[1:05:12] restored. It's a people who are not just
[1:05:15] touched by the Holy Spirit, but they
[1:05:17] have been prepared by the word and
[1:05:20] filled and sealed and they're ready for
[1:05:23] the Lord's return. Aren't you glad to be
[1:05:26] a part of that kind of people this
[1:05:28] morning? So, yeah, it's harvest time and
[1:05:30] and the Lord the harvest is here with
[1:05:33] sickle in his hand and the grain is no
[1:05:36] longer green. Oh yeah, there was a time
[1:05:40] we were all green and you know, but we
[1:05:43] come to a time where it's now a stage of
[1:05:46] maturity and the grain is golden and
[1:05:49] glowing in the evening light and being
[1:05:52] ripened by that light. It's a mature
[1:05:54] bride with a mature word and they're
[1:05:58] equipped with every divine promise of
[1:06:01] God with the gifts of the Holy Spirit,
[1:06:03] the word in manifestation. And they're
[1:06:06] filled with wonder working power having
[1:06:09] both the dynamics and the mechanics. I'm
[1:06:12] talking about you. I'm talking about who
[1:06:15] this end time people is. Amen. that they
[1:06:18] are that kind of people and one that not
[1:06:21] only just have the mechanics, but they
[1:06:23] also have the dynamics of the Holy
[1:06:25] Spirit to go with it. All the while the
[1:06:28] tears are being burned and and are bound
[1:06:31] rather and the weed is being gathered
[1:06:33] and and the same spirit that came down
[1:06:36] at Pentecost is here once again in power
[1:06:41] not to plant for another 2,000year cycle
[1:06:45] of church ages but to gather not to
[1:06:48] initiate redemption but to finish
[1:06:51] redemption. You are in the very moment
[1:06:55] where redemption, all that God has been
[1:06:58] doing through the cycle of thousands of
[1:07:01] years from creation is now coming into
[1:07:05] fulfillment. And and redemption is about
[1:07:09] to be finished. And for the Gentiles,
[1:07:13] it's almost over.
[1:07:16] Amen. It's just about done. Amen. And if
[1:07:19] you come to Christ today, you're one of
[1:07:21] the last few ones. You're like the thief
[1:07:23] on the cross who barely made it in in
[1:07:26] that old dispensation,
[1:07:29] right? Amen. So, you're you're right
[1:07:32] here because we're right on the
[1:07:34] threshold of the rapture of the church.
[1:07:37] And that's why this is not the day of
[1:07:39] Pentecost or the repeat or the return
[1:07:42] because we are not going to be planted.
[1:07:45] We are going to uh be as the grain
[1:07:48] harvested for the rapture. We're not
[1:07:51] prepare preparing to repeat the cycle
[1:07:55] because why? This is the end of the
[1:07:58] world. This time instead of being
[1:08:01] planted, the children of the kingdom are
[1:08:04] being harvested and raptured to the
[1:08:07] marriage supper of the lamb. That's
[1:08:09] where we are, friends. That's the facts.
[1:08:12] And the bride is being made ready,
[1:08:15] prepared, and the called has gone forth.
[1:08:18] I want you to know, friend, the
[1:08:20] scripture that we have read this morning
[1:08:23] or I quoted from Revelation 14 is
[1:08:26] happening at the moment where the where
[1:08:28] where it is. So it said, "Thrust in thy
[1:08:31] sickle and reap for the harvest of the
[1:08:34] earth is ripe." That's where we are. The
[1:08:38] sickle is swinging.
[1:08:41] Amen. The harvest is on and you are a
[1:08:45] part of that harvest. You are being
[1:08:48] gathered. Whether you're a tear, you
[1:08:50] will be bundled to be for the burning or
[1:08:53] whether you're wheat, you'll be gathered
[1:08:54] into the garner and the rest left behind
[1:08:58] will go through the tribulation.
[1:09:01] Now, so the early church of Pentecost
[1:09:04] was like a seed of corn that falls in
[1:09:07] the ground. And what happens first? You
[1:09:09] know what happens? is the process of
[1:09:10] life. It sprouts just a a little blade
[1:09:14] that breaks through the soil and then it
[1:09:17] grows into the stalk and eventually
[1:09:20] forms a tossel and and and and
[1:09:24] but then what does it do? It it finally
[1:09:26] comes back to its original grain. It
[1:09:30] comes full circle
[1:09:33] back to what it was at the beginning.
[1:09:35] And that's where we are. We have come
[1:09:38] full circle.
[1:09:40] Amen. That's exactly what happened with
[1:09:42] the church. It started with Luther like
[1:09:45] a sprouting of truth coming out of the
[1:09:48] darkness and the damp grounds of of the
[1:09:51] dark ages. And then along along came
[1:09:54] Wesley and the growing stalk of
[1:09:56] sanctification becoming the tassel and
[1:09:59] and then the Isuza street a shuck a
[1:10:03] stage that was so close to being the
[1:10:06] grain with its outpouring of gifts and
[1:10:09] supernatural workings of the spirit. But
[1:10:12] now friends we are seeing the church
[1:10:16] come back to its original grain. That's
[1:10:19] where we are. Back to its original
[1:10:22] glory. Back to the very life, the power,
[1:10:25] and the nature that it had at the
[1:10:27] beginning. That's the hour that we're
[1:10:29] in. You see, it is as the sun that rose
[1:10:33] in the east, in Jerusalem, is now
[1:10:37] shining in the west, manifesting the
[1:10:39] same life, the same works, and the same
[1:10:42] word. And let me tell you, when it
[1:10:44] leaves us, it's going back east again.
[1:10:46] and the gospel had turned to the Jews.
[1:10:49] But you see, it's been a journey of
[1:10:52] transformation from the darkness of
[1:10:54] paganism to the light in Luther and from
[1:10:57] Luther to Wesley and from Wesley to
[1:10:59] Isuza Street and from Isuza Street to
[1:11:03] now the original Pentecost. Did you hear
[1:11:06] me? The original Pentecost. We're still
[1:11:09] climbing.
[1:11:10] Amen. We are still changing from glory
[1:11:13] to glory, unveiling the hidden mana, the
[1:11:16] life of Christ, buried through the ages,
[1:11:18] and now coming to full ripeness.
[1:11:23] That's the hour we're in.
[1:11:25] And now the church is ripe.
[1:11:29] Oh, I hope you understand the seed is
[1:11:31] mature.
[1:11:33] And we've held it in our hearts a long
[1:11:35] time, friends, and we've waited for this
[1:11:38] hour. But we are in the time of climax.
[1:11:42] We're in the finishing cycle. The
[1:11:45] ministry of Jesus Christ is now once
[1:11:48] again being reproduced in his body. And
[1:11:51] let me tell you who it is. It's the same
[1:11:53] Jesus with the same power with the same
[1:11:56] Holy Ghost that fell on the day of
[1:11:58] Pentecost is right here again doing the
[1:12:02] same works and moving in the same spirit
[1:12:04] and speaking the same word, not a
[1:12:07] different word. But the original word
[1:12:10] restored back again. We have made the
[1:12:12] cycle. We have turned the corner. We
[1:12:15] have come back to Paul's gospel. We have
[1:12:18] come back to unadulterated
[1:12:21] word of God. Pure unadulterated word
[1:12:25] without a creed or a dogma in it. This
[1:12:28] is where we'll return. And I tell you,
[1:12:30] it's not a different religion. It's not
[1:12:33] a new message. It's not different from
[1:12:35] what Paul taught. It's not the rise of
[1:12:38] another denomination. It's the original
[1:12:40] seed restored,
[1:12:42] the same baptism of the Holy Ghost, the
[1:12:46] same signs, the same wonders, the same
[1:12:48] fire, the same power, the same pillar of
[1:12:51] fire. You say, "Brother Tim, are you
[1:12:53] claiming to have the same angel of God,
[1:12:55] uh the same pillar of fire that was with
[1:12:57] the prophet of God?" I am. Why am I?
[1:13:00] Because that was none other than the
[1:13:02] Lord Jesus Christ in spirit form. and
[1:13:06] he's here today manifesting himself in
[1:13:08] the church.
[1:13:10] Amen. Don't get upset when we declare
[1:13:12] that. We're not trying to impersonate.
[1:13:15] Neither are we trying to be the prophet
[1:13:17] of God. But we are saying the same
[1:13:19] angel, the same Holy Ghost, the same
[1:13:23] power of God, the same Holy Spirit that
[1:13:26] was there is here now and manifesting
[1:13:29] himself in bride form. That's who we are
[1:13:32] and that's what God is doing.
[1:13:37] We're the same kind of believers living
[1:13:39] and walking and testifying under that
[1:13:41] same anointing. You are the apostles of
[1:13:45] this age. What do you mean apostles? One
[1:13:48] cent.
[1:13:50] We're called and we're not going
[1:13:52] backwards.
[1:13:55] We're going from glory to glory.
[1:13:58] Amen. because he said, you know, when
[1:14:00] you look into the mirror of the word and
[1:14:03] you are changed from glory to glory,
[1:14:06] this mirror is is um, you know, is a
[1:14:09] whole different mirror from even any
[1:14:11] kind of fairy tale mirror. Amen. Because
[1:14:14] when you look at this one, you know, you
[1:14:18] you we usually look at a mirror, it's
[1:14:20] pretty honest.
[1:14:24] It shows all the gray. It shows all the
[1:14:27] wrinkles. It shows all the age. It shows
[1:14:29] all the blemishes. A mirror is pretty
[1:14:31] honest. But I want to tell you when this
[1:14:34] one, this is an honest mirror, too. But
[1:14:36] it's not reflecting what you think. When
[1:14:39] you look in this mirror, it is not
[1:14:42] telling as how you are, but what God saw
[1:14:45] of you before the foundation of the
[1:14:47] world. When you look in this mirror, you
[1:14:51] see a perfect image of what you are
[1:14:53] supposed to be. And you are being
[1:14:55] changed as you gaze upon the word. As
[1:14:58] you look to the light of the pillar of
[1:15:00] fire, you are being changed from glory
[1:15:03] to glory until you match
[1:15:06] this mirror the word.
[1:15:12] So don't look at it and just see your
[1:15:13] blemishes.
[1:15:15] See that I'm without spot or wrinkle or
[1:15:18] blemish or any such thing. that I know
[1:15:21] the thoughts that I think towards you
[1:15:23] that they are a peace and not of evil.
[1:15:28] Amen. To give you an expected end. And
[1:15:30] what is our expected end? Brother
[1:15:32] Brandham tells us in desperation back to
[1:15:34] Pentecost again, back to the original
[1:15:37] seed. So we're not going backwards.
[1:15:39] We're going from glory to glory. And
[1:15:42] what is the next glory? What is the next
[1:15:45] change? You know, you know, if you would
[1:15:47] even look in the 1964 question and
[1:15:50] answers and brother Bannon would talk,
[1:15:52] what is next? What is next? Everybody
[1:15:54] was wondering what is next? What's going
[1:15:56] to be next? What is going to be next? He
[1:15:58] said the only thing I see is the coming
[1:16:00] of the Lord Jesus. So, what is next? His
[1:16:04] coming and he's appearing now. Where is
[1:16:07] he appearing? In bride form in a body
[1:16:10] called the bride. He'll be a matchpiece
[1:16:13] to his own glory. Amen. Are you with me?
[1:16:16] So what is the next glory? The next
[1:16:18] shame will be the final one which where
[1:16:21] the body is transformed. When this
[1:16:24] mortal puts on immortality when we are
[1:16:27] changed in a moment
[1:16:30] in a twinkling of an eye into body like
[1:16:33] his own glorious body and we see him as
[1:16:36] he is. Can you imagine that? Keep
[1:16:39] looking at the mirror. Listen church.
[1:16:42] You're looking at the world sometimes
[1:16:43] and you're comparing yourself with them.
[1:16:45] You look at other Christians and you're
[1:16:47] comparing yourself with them and it and
[1:16:50] and that isn't even wise. That's right.
[1:16:53] Look into the word and compare yourself
[1:16:56] with the word. But I fall short, brother
[1:16:58] Tim, when I look in it. Listen, when you
[1:17:01] keep gazing on it, you became changed
[1:17:06] from glory to glory
[1:17:08] until finally you're going to step into
[1:17:11] that final glory. Hallelujah. A a a a
[1:17:15] immortal body. Amen. A changed in a
[1:17:19] moment, twinkling of an eye. A body like
[1:17:21] his own glorious body. But here we are.
[1:17:25] We come down to the final separation. I
[1:17:28] don't know if you notice harvest time is
[1:17:30] where things are separated.
[1:17:33] There's a separation goes on not only
[1:17:35] from the tears but the very planting of
[1:17:38] the wheat. The grain gets separated from
[1:17:42] the chaff, from the tassel, from the
[1:17:44] stall, from all the other parts. And
[1:17:47] it's only the grain that's harvested.
[1:17:50] So from the very first church age to
[1:17:53] now, the wheat and the tears have grown
[1:17:55] together side by side in the same field.
[1:17:58] It's it's almost like the two trees in
[1:18:00] the garden. The the tree of knowledge
[1:18:03] and of good and evil is standing by the
[1:18:05] side of the tree of life. And here in
[1:18:08] the end time, you see the fruits of that
[1:18:10] all coming into fruition where that the
[1:18:13] wheat and the tears have grown side by
[1:18:16] side. And the Bible said in Matthew
[1:18:19] 13:30, "Let both grow together until the
[1:18:22] harvest. And in the time of harvest, I
[1:18:25] will say to the reapers, gather you
[1:18:27] first the tears, and bind them in
[1:18:30] bundles to burn them, but gather the
[1:18:32] wheat into my barn."
[1:18:36] So now the harvest is upon us.
[1:18:39] Amen. The separation has begun. The
[1:18:42] spirit that was sown at Nya, the spirit
[1:18:46] of compromise,
[1:18:48] hierarchy, ecclesiastical dominion has
[1:18:51] all come now to maturity.
[1:18:54] And what the councils and creeds of man
[1:18:56] began in in shadow is now it's now
[1:19:00] coming to a bitter fruit in open
[1:19:03] rebellion against truth. I want you to
[1:19:05] understand that's exactly the hour that
[1:19:08] we are living in where you will see an
[1:19:10] open rebellion against the word of God.
[1:19:15] Whether it be Christian or secular is an
[1:19:18] open rebellion. And with the full weight
[1:19:22] of political power and unity of the
[1:19:24] apostate church, the false vine is
[1:19:28] rising now with boldness to and the
[1:19:30] whole desire of Satan is to extinguish
[1:19:34] the last flicker of true light.
[1:19:38] As we preached just a few Sundays ago,
[1:19:40] you know, where where we said hurt not
[1:19:42] the oil and wine. And that was that was
[1:19:45] said from the lamb himself because
[1:19:49] that's exactly what the enemy wants to
[1:19:51] do. He wants to take away the the the
[1:19:54] the wine of the of revelation, the
[1:19:57] stimulation of revelation. He wants to
[1:20:00] take the praise out of the church. He
[1:20:02] wants to take worship out of the church.
[1:20:04] He wants to take the power of God out of
[1:20:05] the church. He wants to remove the
[1:20:07] supernatural from the church. So, he'll
[1:20:09] do everything he can to demonize it and
[1:20:12] minimize it.
[1:20:16] You can hardly hear the supernatural
[1:20:19] talked about without somebody trying to
[1:20:20] demonize it and say, "Oh, you know, you
[1:20:24] remember you remember you know it'll be
[1:20:26] so close. It'll be so close. It'll
[1:20:28] deceive the elect. Oh, it'll be so it'll
[1:20:30] be so close. It it'll it'll be you know
[1:20:33] those many will come to me in that day
[1:20:35] and say, "Lord, Lord, have we not cast
[1:20:37] out devils in thy name? Have we not
[1:20:38] spoken tongues?" You know what the the
[1:20:40] whole purpose of doing it is to try to
[1:20:44] minimize
[1:20:46] the power of God.
[1:20:49] The moment that the Holy Spirit begins
[1:20:52] to move because Satan hates the wine of
[1:20:56] revelation. That's right. It enlightens
[1:20:59] the eyes and opens us to truth. But the
[1:21:01] Bible tells you that the world today is
[1:21:04] going to be together under one union.
[1:21:07] The Bible said these have one mind and
[1:21:09] they give their power and strength unto
[1:21:12] the beast.
[1:21:13] And you see it, you see men doing it.
[1:21:16] You see women doing it. You see nations
[1:21:17] doing it. All of them given having one
[1:21:20] mind and give their power and strength
[1:21:24] to the beast. Now friends, we are also
[1:21:26] to have one mind. Let the mind that was
[1:21:29] in Christ be in you. Come on. Amen. And
[1:21:33] we are also to give our power and
[1:21:35] strength unto him. But you see, it's two
[1:21:38] vines that are coming together in the
[1:21:40] harvest in this last day. And a
[1:21:42] separation is being made. And you're
[1:21:45] going to find yourself on one side of
[1:21:47] the other, God help us to be on the
[1:21:49] right side.
[1:21:52] So yeah, just as a false church will
[1:21:55] rises to stamp out the remnant. And let
[1:21:57] me tell you, pressures are coming like
[1:22:00] you've never seen. But I want you to
[1:22:02] understand, suddenly the wheat will be
[1:22:04] gathered into the garner. The true bride
[1:22:06] is taken and the rapture will remove her
[1:22:09] from the scene. And no longer will the
[1:22:11] tears benefit from the presence of the
[1:22:15] righteous. No longer will the blessings
[1:22:17] linger because of the intercession of
[1:22:20] the bride for she'll be gone. She'll be
[1:22:22] taken up to meet her Lord in the air.
[1:22:25] You say, "Brother Tim, intercession of
[1:22:26] the bride." Do you know, brother Bradam
[1:22:28] even mentioned that? And he said the
[1:22:30] very thing he said you don't realize
[1:22:33] some of you little sisters that they
[1:22:35] call old-fashioned you little holiness
[1:22:38] women. He said just as the moon holds
[1:22:40] back the tides of the ocean and they can
[1:22:43] only go so far. He said even little
[1:22:47] godly women like you are holding off the
[1:22:50] wrath of God off the earth right now.
[1:22:54] Think of that.
[1:22:56] Amen. So you see,
[1:22:59] we have been in the cycle, you know,
[1:23:01] where everybody's blessed because we're
[1:23:03] blessed.
[1:23:05] The rain falls on the just and the
[1:23:06] unjust.
[1:23:08] Your communities are blessed because of
[1:23:10] you.
[1:23:12] Your your state is blessed because of
[1:23:14] you. Your nation is blessed because of
[1:23:17] you. But one day you're going to be
[1:23:19] gone.
[1:23:22] Amen. One day you're going to be gone.
[1:23:23] And no longer will the blessings of God
[1:23:25] linger upon the earth. And that's when
[1:23:28] the Bible said, "He that is filthy be
[1:23:30] filthy still. And he that is holy be
[1:23:32] holy still. He that is righteous and be
[1:23:34] righteous still."
[1:23:36] And after that, not another Gentile
[1:23:38] saved.
[1:23:40] So, we are not as as we taught a few
[1:23:44] Sundays ago about the the the
[1:23:47] dispensation of the Gentiles coming in
[1:23:49] and that mystery that the Jews, the
[1:23:52] Jewish believers at that time did not
[1:23:54] even know and they didn't even realize
[1:23:57] that the Gentiles were going to be a
[1:23:59] part of the of the of the economy of
[1:24:02] God. Oh my goodness, they would have
[1:24:05] never believed that we would be the
[1:24:07] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:24:09] No sir, they were always had been the
[1:24:12] chosen people. But this this was a
[1:24:14] mystery that had been hidden from the
[1:24:16] ages but is revealed. And now we have
[1:24:20] come down to where that mystery has
[1:24:22] taken on flesh form. And now there is a
[1:24:25] bride here upon the earth. There's a
[1:24:27] people for his name's sake. There are
[1:24:30] people who have taken on his name in
[1:24:32] baptism. They have taken on his name in
[1:24:34] action. They know who their father is.
[1:24:37] They know where they are from and they
[1:24:39] know where they're going. There are
[1:24:42] people who have been called in this
[1:24:44] generation. So notice as I said because
[1:24:49] when when the bride leaves from here,
[1:24:51] what follows is the wrath of God will be
[1:24:54] poured out under the sixth seal.
[1:24:57] Judgment upon the earth as foretold in
[1:24:59] Revelation 6:12. when men cry for the
[1:25:03] rocks and the mountains to fall on them
[1:25:06] to hide them from the face of him that
[1:25:08] siteth on the throne and from the wrath
[1:25:10] of the lamb.
[1:25:13] So this is where we are in time. It's
[1:25:15] like um the Israel and and you know
[1:25:19] because Israel and I refer to them
[1:25:21] because they are our spiritual
[1:25:24] counterpart. what they are physically in
[1:25:27] the land and a physical seed and a
[1:25:29] physical people. We are a spiritual
[1:25:31] people and a spiritual land and spirit
[1:25:34] with spiritual promises
[1:25:36] and like Israel and the Israeli prime
[1:25:39] minister Benjamin not Netanyahu just
[1:25:42] named the recent military operation
[1:25:44] against Iran operation rising lion. You
[1:25:49] see it's the time of judgment. It is the
[1:25:52] pouring out of the wrath against the
[1:25:55] Iranian regime that has vowed to wipe
[1:25:58] Israel off of the face of the earth. And
[1:26:02] I want you to understand that's exactly
[1:26:04] what the devil has for you. He wants to
[1:26:07] completely wipe us out.
[1:26:09] But he can't. There's a word that's
[1:26:11] against him. No, we're not going to be
[1:26:14] wiped out. We're going to be taken out.
[1:26:17] That's exactly right. And so again, you
[1:26:20] know, they they're rising. Oh, I my
[1:26:23] heart just beat within me as they said
[1:26:25] the rising the operating rising lion.
[1:26:28] And I'm thinking, "Oh, God, there's a
[1:26:31] lion about to rise up. The lion of
[1:26:35] Judah,
[1:26:36] hallelujah. And I tell you what, he's
[1:26:38] going to be king over the earth. His
[1:26:41] bride will rule with him." Amen. And and
[1:26:44] I tell you, as he rises there to take
[1:26:47] his throne, to take the earth back from
[1:26:50] Satan's dominion, I tell you, we're in
[1:26:52] an hour. We're in a wonderful hour,
[1:26:55] church. We're in the hour that everybody
[1:26:57] else has dreamed about, long for, prayed
[1:27:01] about, cried, even say, "Even so, come
[1:27:04] Lord Jesus." And you are now in the
[1:27:06] cycle of his coming.
[1:27:11] That name was inspired by biblical verse
[1:27:14] from the from the book of numbers which
[1:27:16] states, "Behold, the people shall rise
[1:27:19] up as a great lion." The name rise and
[1:27:22] lion is intended to symbolize Israel's
[1:27:25] strength, her determination, her resolve
[1:27:28] to defend itself against all threats.
[1:27:32] And the same spirits that are determined
[1:27:34] to wipe Israel off the face of the earth
[1:27:36] is the same spirit against the bride to
[1:27:39] take the life out of you to kill you
[1:27:42] dead. Dead dead to move the Holy Spirit
[1:27:46] out of your life. But I'm telling you,
[1:27:49] there ought to be some lions rise up,
[1:27:52] men and women with that's anointed in
[1:27:55] this day and hour to rule with him as
[1:27:57] kings and priests. Amen. rising up and
[1:28:00] and and realize they will not wipe us
[1:28:03] out and they will not take away our
[1:28:05] glory and they will not remove the power
[1:28:07] of God from us and they will not take
[1:28:10] the shadow of the king out of our midst
[1:28:12] and they will not take the miracles and
[1:28:14] the signs and the wonders of his
[1:28:16] presence. They cannot do it. Satan
[1:28:19] cannot stop it. There is something
[1:28:21] already been released that the devil
[1:28:24] cannot put back into the box.
[1:28:28] The seals are open. The word is
[1:28:30] revealed. And once that word has been
[1:28:32] released, it cannot return unto him
[1:28:35] void. It has to accomplish what he sent
[1:28:37] it to do.
[1:28:44] The same spirit is determined to wipe
[1:28:46] Israel off the face of the earth is the
[1:28:48] same spirit against the bride. But it
[1:28:51] comes against us in a phys rather than a
[1:28:56] physical manner. It's an ecclesiastical
[1:28:59] attack to shut down the supernatural
[1:29:03] to remove us from the homeland of the
[1:29:06] Bible. And don't forget our lamb is also
[1:29:11] a lion.
[1:29:15] Amen. Remember, remember he said,
[1:29:18] "Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:29:20] hath prevailed." And he looked and he
[1:29:23] saw a lamb. I'm so glad when I look on
[1:29:26] him. I don't see an angry king.
[1:29:30] I don't see a roaring lion. Oh yeah. My
[1:29:34] my the bride's husband, let me tell you.
[1:29:36] See, he's a lion against his enemies. He
[1:29:40] is a lion against sin. He roars. He
[1:29:45] roars with fierceness about the evil
[1:29:48] that is going on in the world. Are you
[1:29:50] with me? But I want you to know when I
[1:29:53] look at him, I don't see him as a lion.
[1:29:57] He's a gentle lamb. He's the lamb of God
[1:30:00] slain for me. He provided redemption for
[1:30:03] me. He poured his love upon me.
[1:30:07] And his bride is his pleasure. She's his
[1:30:10] delight. She is his glory.
[1:30:16] So don't forget our lamb is a lion.
[1:30:20] Revelation 10
[1:30:23] uh Revelation 10 shows us even this one
[1:30:27] that sat on the throne. This one that
[1:30:30] rose up to take the book. The lion of
[1:30:32] the tribe of Judah has risen to take
[1:30:35] possession of title and it's handed it
[1:30:38] to the bride. It establishes the bride
[1:30:41] as the owner of the title deed to every
[1:30:44] divine promise.
[1:30:47] And I want to say again, the lion is
[1:30:49] rising.
[1:30:51] Behold, a people shall rise up as a
[1:30:53] great lion and lift himself up as a
[1:30:56] young lion. He shall not lie down until
[1:30:59] he eat of the prey and drink the blood
[1:31:01] of the slain. What is this declaring? We
[1:31:05] shall be victorious
[1:31:08] over every one of our enemies.
[1:31:12] You say, "Brother Tim, I I'm struggling.
[1:31:14] I I I've been beset. And I I'm I'm
[1:31:17] having I'm in a battle. I'm telling you,
[1:31:20] rise up, lion.
[1:31:23] Amen. There's a lion inside of you. You
[1:31:25] are anointed to overthrow and to tear
[1:31:29] down Satan's kingdom. For I give you
[1:31:32] power to tread on serpents and scorpions
[1:31:35] and every evil thing. And nothing shall
[1:31:37] by any means harm you. Somebody help me
[1:31:40] preach. Now, that's the word of God to
[1:31:42] you this morning. He gives you that
[1:31:44] anointing to put your foot on your
[1:31:47] enemy.
[1:31:54] So let me tell you, let the lion roar.
[1:31:57] You know what a lion's roar is? Is a
[1:31:58] prophetic message. And you have been
[1:32:01] given a voice, a prophetic message. And
[1:32:06] let may let his message be proclaimed
[1:32:08] there. Let us eat of the prey. Let us
[1:32:10] taste of sweet victory. Let us see the
[1:32:13] power of God exhibit its power over
[1:32:17] everything
[1:32:18] over cancer, over disease, over sin,
[1:32:23] over sickness. Let me tell you, this
[1:32:25] lion can rise up and and set you free
[1:32:29] from years and years and years of
[1:32:32] bondage.
[1:32:34] You look around this people. You may be
[1:32:35] a visitor here this morning. You look
[1:32:37] around and you see a bunch of people
[1:32:39] that you think are holy people and and
[1:32:42] great people and and pristine Christian
[1:32:45] people. I want you to know we all had
[1:32:47] our past.
[1:32:49] Amen. We all had our past. We all lived
[1:32:53] as slaves. We all were in bondage. We
[1:32:56] all sinned and fall fell short of the
[1:32:58] glory of God. But I want you to know,
[1:33:00] friends, there was a change that took
[1:33:02] place. And we're no longer the same. We
[1:33:05] are no longer a slave to sin.
[1:33:09] Hallelujah. We have been redeemed. And
[1:33:11] I'll tell you what, we will not be
[1:33:13] annihilated.
[1:33:15] And we will not be just another movement
[1:33:17] that goes down in defeat. We will rise
[1:33:21] because we have the lion's message. So
[1:33:24] let it roar. I tell you what, let it
[1:33:27] roar against depression. Let it roar and
[1:33:30] defeat suicidal spirits. Let it take its
[1:33:33] head off of sickness, over disease, over
[1:33:36] sin of every kind. Let the lion roar.
[1:33:42] Let the message of God be proclaimed.
[1:33:46] Let it say, "Let my people go."
[1:33:53] Rise up lion, thrust in thy sickle. The
[1:33:58] time is now. Reap the harvest.
[1:34:03] You see, the false church has now reaped
[1:34:07] her full ripeness.
[1:34:10] She is similar to that mustard seed of
[1:34:13] Matthew chapter 13 verse 31 that grew
[1:34:18] unnaturally into a great tree where the
[1:34:21] fowls of the air unclean spirits have
[1:34:24] made their nest.
[1:34:26] She is the habitation of devils, the
[1:34:29] hold of every foul spirit. Her head is
[1:34:32] the antichrist, the mystery of iniquity
[1:34:36] and already at work from Paul's day, but
[1:34:39] now revealed in his fullness, exposed by
[1:34:43] the Holy Spirit. Amen. You know, the
[1:34:46] Bible the Bible speaks of it of that man
[1:34:49] of sin that would be there sitting in
[1:34:51] the temple of God, worshiped as God, a
[1:34:54] false religion, a false Christ under the
[1:34:58] mask of Christianity.
[1:35:01] But let me tell you, it tells us in the
[1:35:02] last day that that wicked one would be
[1:35:05] revealed. He would be exposed. And
[1:35:09] that's a whole deal of this message. You
[1:35:11] wonder why in the world was the seven
[1:35:14] seals which would reveal Christ with
[1:35:16] talk so much about the antichrist
[1:35:18] because it was exposing the false vine.
[1:35:21] It was exposing the false Christ. And if
[1:35:23] so it could you could see the real
[1:35:25] Christ. It was taking the mask off of
[1:35:28] Satan. It was taking the mask off a
[1:35:30] false religion. It was revealing Christ
[1:35:34] to a people in this last day.
[1:35:39] So at this
[1:35:41] is true of the false vine, then how much
[1:35:44] more must the be true of the true vine?
[1:35:48] If the tears have matured, so must the
[1:35:51] wheat.
[1:35:54] If the false started from a small
[1:35:56] beginning, so have we.
[1:36:00] Come on. Amen. The church started with a
[1:36:05] small mustard seed of faith and she has
[1:36:09] now grown into a great tree.
[1:36:13] The bright tree is restored.
[1:36:18] Come on.
[1:36:20] Amen. I I I can't I can't help it. What
[1:36:22] you see yourself, I can't help it. The
[1:36:25] spiritual climate
[1:36:28] of many churches today. I can't help
[1:36:30] none of that. I want to declare one once
[1:36:32] again what I believe and I believe the
[1:36:35] bride has been restored.
[1:36:39] Amen. The bride tree with all the gifts
[1:36:42] of the spirit with all the power of God
[1:36:46] with the clapping of the hands with the
[1:36:48] worship under God with the shout of the
[1:36:50] king. It's all been restored. Every bit
[1:36:53] of it.
[1:36:58] She's a restored tree and she's a grown
[1:37:01] into a great tree
[1:37:04] and the lights are shining in the top of
[1:37:07] the tree and her fruits are ripe and
[1:37:10] ready for harvest.
[1:37:13] It's harvest time. It's going home time.
[1:37:19] It's time
[1:37:22] where we're seeing the flashing red
[1:37:24] lights of the sign of his coming. And
[1:37:27] it's time that you throw down your bag
[1:37:30] of worldly peanuts
[1:37:34] and get on the train.
[1:37:38] You see, because all the pursuits of
[1:37:41] life is all peanuts.
[1:37:50] If you miss that rapture, it's all
[1:37:54] peanuts.
[1:37:55] Even if you're a billionaire,
[1:37:59] what would it do if you gain the whole
[1:38:01] world and lose your own soul?
[1:38:04] Why be complacent in this hour? Why be
[1:38:07] lukewarm concerning the truth? You see,
[1:38:12] again, her identity is becoming clear.
[1:38:15] She is now the bride, the grain she was
[1:38:18] at Pentecost. Her nature is refined.
[1:38:21] She's exactly like Christ. Her fruit is
[1:38:24] unmistakable. For she, the bride tree,
[1:38:27] is bringing forth mature fruit for this
[1:38:29] hour. And just as Jesus said, "The works
[1:38:32] that I do shall you do also, and greater
[1:38:34] works than these shall you do." So does
[1:38:37] the bride here in this final hour in
[1:38:40] this final move with the same spirit the
[1:38:42] same word manifesting the same power and
[1:38:46] the headstone that we quoted about is
[1:38:49] coming down and descending upon us
[1:38:54] already that you know the the spiritual
[1:38:57] phase of it has come the word coming
[1:39:01] it's the head it's the headstone
[1:39:04] amen has come down with with and united
[1:39:07] with the body. And we become one with
[1:39:10] the word. And it says over and over and
[1:39:12] over again, if every time you read it,
[1:39:15] favor upon favor upon favor and grace
[1:39:19] upon grace upon grace. It's rapturing
[1:39:23] grace.
[1:39:28] But friends,
[1:39:30] one day the literal and final headstone
[1:39:33] will come and that's Jesus Christ.
[1:39:36] And and Zechariah said, "He shall bring
[1:39:38] forth the headstone with shoutings,
[1:39:42] crying, shouting, grace, grace,
[1:39:49] and you're against shouting,
[1:39:53] and you ridicule us for shouting,
[1:39:57] and you poke and prodded us for
[1:39:59] shouting, we got something to shout
[1:40:01] about."
[1:40:03] Hallelujah. Amen. Because we have the
[1:40:06] headstone has come down upon us and it
[1:40:08] is telling us favor upon favor upon
[1:40:11] favor and grace upon grace upon grace.
[1:40:14] Hallelujah. And it gives us something to
[1:40:16] shout about. We're not just making
[1:40:18] noise.
[1:40:20] No, we've got the word back in power
[1:40:23] again. And it heals our sick. It saves
[1:40:26] our young. It Oh, it delivers the
[1:40:29] everyone from sin, from unbelief, from
[1:40:32] the power of darkness. That's what it
[1:40:34] does. And it gives it I tell you what,
[1:40:37] when I go to thinking about it, it makes
[1:40:39] me want to shout.
[1:40:43] It wants me to behave unseemingly
[1:40:47] as if I got into wine, new wine.
[1:40:56] I want you to look around
[1:41:00] and I want you to understand
[1:41:02] that as Eve was taken to the side of
[1:41:04] Adam and brought back to him, so shall
[1:41:07] the bride be united with Christ as bone
[1:41:10] of his bone and flesh of his flesh and
[1:41:13] word of his word and spirit of his
[1:41:14] spirit.
[1:41:18] Just take a look around for a moment.
[1:41:21] These things are no longer future tense.
[1:41:27] I think we ought to kind of have a
[1:41:30] little checkup this morning. Look around
[1:41:32] real good. The signs are visible
[1:41:36] everywhere.
[1:41:39] Look at Israel, not just in her
[1:41:40] homeland, but now a powerful army.
[1:41:46] Amen. I'm not going to call her
[1:41:48] invincible because we're the invincible
[1:41:50] army.
[1:41:52] But she's a powerful army. I want you to
[1:41:54] open your eyes and see Russia, the king
[1:41:57] of the north, expanding its borders.
[1:42:00] I want you to look and listen to our
[1:42:03] president crying peace, peace, and
[1:42:05] making deals through commerce and
[1:42:08] controlling nations through commerce. I
[1:42:10] want you to look at scientific
[1:42:12] advancements and driverless cars and
[1:42:15] artificial intelligence.
[1:42:18] The tree of knowledge has reached its
[1:42:20] height. I want you to look at the moral
[1:42:23] decay. Open your eyes. Amen. Let the
[1:42:27] Isab of the word, you know, wash out the
[1:42:29] smoke of that pit
[1:42:33] spoke of in Revelation chapter nine
[1:42:35] where the the hell was opened and all
[1:42:38] these demon powers rise up out of the
[1:42:41] pit as smoke that permeates every bit
[1:42:45] every fabric of society.
[1:42:49] You ever have a fire in your house? You
[1:42:52] ladies even burn the beans. You got to
[1:42:54] wash all the clothes. You got to pull
[1:42:56] the curtains down. You got to wash them
[1:42:58] all. It gets into everything.
[1:43:03] You smell like burnt beans. I won't say
[1:43:06] you look that way, but you smell that
[1:43:08] way.
[1:43:10] And you know, again, you know why?
[1:43:12] Because it permeates, it saturates
[1:43:14] everything. It saturates all of society.
[1:43:22] Families are not what they used to be.
[1:43:24] Fathers don't even know how to behave.
[1:43:26] They don't know how to be real men.
[1:43:31] I look around and as I I I can't help
[1:43:34] but notice young boys in their pink
[1:43:36] panties
[1:43:39] shorts
[1:43:41] walking around, you know, in their
[1:43:43] shorts,
[1:43:45] two or three necklaces wrapped around
[1:43:46] their neck and a big bracelet on and all
[1:43:49] of this other stuff. And I said, "Boys
[1:43:52] don't know how to be men.
[1:43:57] No wonder we got a a mess in the world
[1:44:00] when men don't know how to be fathers.
[1:44:04] They don't know how to be masculine. And
[1:44:06] I'm not talking about chauvinist. I'm
[1:44:08] talking about masculine.
[1:44:10] I'm talking about men with backbone, men
[1:44:13] with leadership, men with heaven's
[1:44:16] guidance, men who are molded on their
[1:44:20] knees, men who have been through the
[1:44:23] trials and tribulation and have come out
[1:44:25] victorious,
[1:44:27] men who are soldiers, men who are
[1:44:29] overcomers,
[1:44:31] men who rise above above the the
[1:44:35] nonsense of this world. Men need to be
[1:44:37] men. We need some real fathers. I want
[1:44:41] to say I'm thankful for Evening Light
[1:44:43] Tabernacle. I'm thankful for real
[1:44:45] fathers. Real men who know how to be
[1:44:48] men, how to lead their families, how to
[1:44:51] guide them in prayer, how to have family
[1:44:53] devotion, how to bring them to church.
[1:45:00] They have the same custom that Jesus
[1:45:02] did. Jesus had this custom that on the
[1:45:06] Sabbath day he went
[1:45:09] to the synagogue
[1:45:12] as was his custom.
[1:45:16] Men, that's part of their fabric.
[1:45:20] But I want you to look
[1:45:23] at the moral decay. I want you to open
[1:45:25] your eyes. Let the Isab of the word just
[1:45:29] watch the smoke of hell that is causing
[1:45:31] a blinding delusion.
[1:45:35] And I want you to realize, you know, as
[1:45:37] I said, the moral decay, the uh where
[1:45:40] marriage is set aside and and even if
[1:45:43] there is marriage, you know, they want
[1:45:44] to try to they want to try to um
[1:45:48] disgrace it until it's it's same-sex
[1:45:51] marriages and every other kind of thing.
[1:45:54] It loses its meaning.
[1:45:57] and fiance where that used to mean I'm
[1:46:01] engaged. You know, I have plans to be
[1:46:03] married and you know, we have a oh it
[1:46:06] it's a it's something we're waiting for
[1:46:09] those that sacred vow and we're looking
[1:46:12] forward to that and we're expecting that
[1:46:14] and and we're living holy while we're
[1:46:17] we're expecting that now becomes a loose
[1:46:20] term. It's just somebody I'm shacking
[1:46:24] with.
[1:46:31] You see,
[1:46:35] the world will tell you that's okay
[1:46:39] because it's smoke has blinded the eyes.
[1:46:47] It is the smoke of hell. But I want you
[1:46:50] to know there's a remedy for it.
[1:46:54] I want you to know there is a remedy
[1:46:56] provided for this last age. In
[1:46:58] Revelation chapter 3, he said, "Buy of
[1:47:00] me is
[1:47:03] you blind that Leo to see and blinded,
[1:47:06] blinded by your own desire to do your
[1:47:09] own thing, having a delusion that you're
[1:47:11] going to heaven, living the way you are,
[1:47:13] and you're not. You're on your way to
[1:47:15] hell." And there is a hell.
[1:47:24] But there is an eyes out that'll wash
[1:47:26] that out of your eyes. That'll change
[1:47:29] your thinking. It'll change the way you
[1:47:30] see things. It'll change your
[1:47:32] perception.
[1:47:36] Somebody say amen.
[1:47:40] Amen. So the tires are being bundled.
[1:47:45] It's true. The ecumenical movement is
[1:47:48] real.
[1:47:50] Oh, brother D, I don't see a physical
[1:47:53] manifestation. Listen, it's a spirit and
[1:47:57] it's all it's prevalent everywhere.
[1:48:01] Maybe it hasn't really exercised its
[1:48:04] muscles through the through a world
[1:48:06] council of churches or or something like
[1:48:08] that. Maybe it hadn't and yet, you know,
[1:48:11] get it has got its power, but it will.
[1:48:15] But right now, the spirit of it is
[1:48:16] prevalent everywhere, demanding that you
[1:48:19] conform to their thinking.
[1:48:22] The harlot daughters are returning to
[1:48:24] their mother as in Revelation 17:5. The
[1:48:27] religious system of this world, they're
[1:48:30] preparing for their final act of
[1:48:31] betrayal.
[1:48:34] You may ask me today, what is ecumenism?
[1:48:40] The religious ecumenical movement is a
[1:48:42] widespread influential trend in modern
[1:48:46] Christianity that seeks to promote unity
[1:48:50] among different Christian denominations
[1:48:52] and increasingly interfaith cooperation.
[1:48:56] And that sounds very noble.
[1:48:59] You know, on the surface that's very
[1:49:01] noble. Let's all just get along. This
[1:49:04] has all come together where you know
[1:49:06] whether you're Muslim, whether you're
[1:49:08] Buddha, whether you're you're Christian,
[1:49:11] whether you're Catholic, whether you're
[1:49:12] Protestant, whether you believe this or
[1:49:14] you don't believe, you're all going to
[1:49:15] the same place.
[1:49:17] You may be.
[1:49:22] You may well be.
[1:49:25] But I'm not going where you're going.
[1:49:28] I've got a different destiny.
[1:49:31] Are you with me? So it sounds noble on
[1:49:34] the surface prevailing thought behind
[1:49:36] the movement you know is noble thought
[1:49:39] but it's actually is binding the tears
[1:49:44] and I want you to understand you know
[1:49:46] you're looking for a physical binding of
[1:49:48] the tears and you're you're looking for
[1:49:50] a time where listen when it becomes the
[1:49:54] physical mark of the beast the bride is
[1:49:56] already gone
[1:50:00] it don't become literal yet it's all
[1:50:02] spiritual. And right now there is a
[1:50:05] spiritual gathering and a spiritual
[1:50:07] binding
[1:50:09] of the tears.
[1:50:11] And it's under the the spirit that's
[1:50:13] binding them together is ecummunism.
[1:50:20] It's lukewarmness.
[1:50:23] You'll get it. Ecummunism is
[1:50:26] lukewarmness
[1:50:27] with a fancy name.
[1:50:31] It is the cord that be binds the tears
[1:50:33] together. So you see it bring they want
[1:50:38] to they want to have unity
[1:50:41] over doctrine.
[1:50:43] So it's the idea of let us just focus on
[1:50:47] what unites us not what divides us.
[1:50:52] And there's a intentional deemphasis of
[1:50:54] of doctrinal truth like baptism,
[1:50:57] godhead, holiness, salvation in favor of
[1:51:00] promoting fellowship and cooperation.
[1:51:05] So you see it's it's a deal where you
[1:51:08] deemphasize this and emphasize
[1:51:14] what unites us.
[1:51:17] peace and tolerance and reconciliation.
[1:51:21] Why in the world are you seeing all of
[1:51:23] this, you know, that is going on here in
[1:51:25] America today, you know, speaking of
[1:51:28] peace and tolerance and reconciliation
[1:51:31] and, you know, oh, it's all under the
[1:51:34] cloud of of the guise of the shadow of
[1:51:38] being good.
[1:51:42] And the ecumenical movement appeals to
[1:51:44] modern ideas of of inclusion, of
[1:51:47] non-judgmentalism and coexistence.
[1:51:51] You know, for the sake of peace and
[1:51:53] getting along, it tolerates sin.
[1:51:58] It's the pale horse beginning its ride
[1:52:02] and death follows.
[1:52:04] You know, pale is a a color of that
[1:52:07] fourth horse rider spoke of in the book
[1:52:09] of Revelation. And you know, you have
[1:52:10] one white and one red and one black.
[1:52:14] And this one pale is needle red and it's
[1:52:16] not white and it's not black.
[1:52:19] In fact, it's not even a definable
[1:52:21] color.
[1:52:24] It's actually a combination or
[1:52:27] amalgamation or of all of these others
[1:52:30] combined
[1:52:32] into one.
[1:52:36] And so
[1:52:37] it is already beginning is right. We're
[1:52:41] right here on the threshold
[1:52:44] where the gun will go off at the rapture
[1:52:50] and the horse will be let out of the
[1:52:52] gate.
[1:52:57] And when he rides,
[1:52:59] hell follows him.
[1:53:03] hell will literally come on the earth.
[1:53:08] So right now it spirit is already going
[1:53:12] out and is already influenced. I I want
[1:53:14] you to remember right now we're still in
[1:53:16] the part of the black horse riding.
[1:53:20] Honestly, that's the truth. The black
[1:53:23] horse is that which that you know wants
[1:53:27] to wants to control the bread of life.
[1:53:30] It's a If it's what the spirit calls on
[1:53:34] said, don't hurt the oil and the wine.
[1:53:36] We're still living in that time. The
[1:53:38] fourth horse rider has not began its
[1:53:40] ride. It will not ride until the the
[1:53:42] rapture when the bride goes, as I said,
[1:53:44] the gun goes off. It'll be released from
[1:53:46] the gate. It will start its final ride.
[1:53:50] But already we can feel its hot breath.
[1:53:54] We can see its influence. It's already
[1:53:57] here because it's already ridden in all
[1:53:59] these other forms. And now it is
[1:54:02] changing to its pale form.
[1:54:05] And truth in this day is being
[1:54:07] compromised for the sake of unity. And
[1:54:10] the scripture warns against fellowship
[1:54:12] with era because he said, "How can two
[1:54:15] walk together
[1:54:17] except to be agreed?"
[1:54:19] It says in Amos 3 and 3, uh, you know,
[1:54:22] that's what it said in Amos 3:3, but in
[1:54:24] in 2 Corinthians 6:17, it says, "Come
[1:54:27] out from among them, and be you
[1:54:29] separate.
[1:54:31] You see, it's an hour of separation. You
[1:54:34] see, it it's a false scene of peace. Oh,
[1:54:39] that is being exalted over purity. When
[1:54:42] Jesus said, "I didn't come to bring
[1:54:44] peace,
[1:54:46] but I come to bring a sword." What is
[1:54:49] that sword for, brother Tim? That sounds
[1:54:51] harsh. I mean, are we going to go out
[1:54:52] and start killing anybody don't believe
[1:54:54] us? That's not what we're talking about.
[1:54:56] That's not Christianity. Jesus said he
[1:54:59] did not come to bring peace but a sword.
[1:55:01] And that sword is to divide truth from
[1:55:04] error.
[1:55:06] But you see, ecummunism dulls that
[1:55:09] sword. I'm telling you what's binding.
[1:55:13] Now again, prophetically, it aligns with
[1:55:16] the harlot system of Revelation 17. The
[1:55:19] mother of harlots is a picture of the
[1:55:22] vault church system riding the beast
[1:55:25] political power, uniting for global
[1:55:28] influence. And the the this end time
[1:55:31] religious unity backed by political
[1:55:34] pressure prepares the world to receive
[1:55:36] the Antichrist,
[1:55:38] not Jesus Christ.
[1:55:41] And Jesus and the apostles, they never
[1:55:44] called for unity with the world. that
[1:55:46] turns a blind eye to sin, but rather a
[1:55:50] unity with the spirit. And he said,
[1:55:52] "Sanctify them or separate them."
[1:55:57] Separate sin. Sanctify means cleanse.
[1:56:00] Separate them from the dirt. Sanctify
[1:56:02] them through that truth. Thy word is
[1:56:05] truth.
[1:56:07] Brother, I'm glad that this gospel
[1:56:09] didn't come to save me in my sins. It
[1:56:11] came to save me from my sins.
[1:56:14] Amen. You're not a saved person if
[1:56:16] you're still out in sin. You You There
[1:56:19] is no such a thing as a saved sinner.
[1:56:23] Come on, church. We're not saved
[1:56:25] sinners. We are sons and daughters of
[1:56:28] God washed by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:56:31] We might have once been a sinner, but
[1:56:34] that was not our urgent. Our urgent came
[1:56:36] from God, and now we are going back to
[1:56:39] God. Our destiny is not just to continue
[1:56:42] being a sin sinner, but we are
[1:56:45] overcomers by the blood of the lamb and
[1:56:48] by the word of our testimony.
[1:56:55] There is one body and one spirit. One
[1:56:57] Lord, one faith, one baptism.
[1:57:01] One
[1:57:04] true biblical unity comes through
[1:57:06] revelation.
[1:57:08] Not by joining hands with the ideas of
[1:57:10] men.
[1:57:12] The true Bible is not ecomunical. Is
[1:57:15] called out. You have been called out.
[1:57:18] Remember,
[1:57:20] remember before e Egypt could could be
[1:57:23] completely judged, God had to call out
[1:57:25] an elect,
[1:57:28] a separated people who walk in the light
[1:57:30] of the word. Ecommunism when embraced as
[1:57:35] as a spiritual mindset rather than just
[1:57:38] a movement, it has a deep and subtle
[1:57:41] effect on how people think, how they
[1:57:44] believe, and how they behave in everyday
[1:57:46] life. And on one side it it claims to
[1:57:49] promote peace and unity and tolerance,
[1:57:51] but that's just on the suffer the
[1:57:53] surface. The underlying influence
[1:57:57] gradually erodess a believer's
[1:57:59] discernment, his conviction, his
[1:58:01] obedience to God's word.
[1:58:06] It takes you away from the standard, the
[1:58:09] absolute, the Bible.
[1:58:11] Somebody with me? I want you to know God
[1:58:14] has a standard.
[1:58:16] Let's get it clear what God's going to
[1:58:18] judge the world by. He will not judge it
[1:58:21] by you or me. We are not the standard.
[1:58:24] Eden like tabernacle is not the
[1:58:26] standard. Denominations is not the
[1:58:28] standard. There is one standard and
[1:58:30] that's God's word.
[1:58:33] Amen. Are you with me? This is our
[1:58:35] absolute. The Bible, the word of God. It
[1:58:38] is our absolute. And he said, "Don't you
[1:58:41] be conformed to the way the world
[1:58:44] thinks, but be you transformed how? By
[1:58:47] the renewing of your mind."
[1:58:51] You got to have a different mind than
[1:58:53] the rest of the world. A man who doesn't
[1:58:55] have a different mind and a different
[1:58:57] thinking when he is saved is not saved.
[1:59:00] He's still lost.
[1:59:04] Because when you're saved, you're saved
[1:59:06] from the world's thinking, from Satan's
[1:59:09] lies. You're established on truth.
[1:59:12] So people start thinking, "Well, all
[1:59:15] churches are basically the same.
[1:59:17] Everybody's going to heaven.
[1:59:20] It's doctrine. It just divides. You
[1:59:22] know, what matters is love."
[1:59:26] So then, you know what they do? They
[1:59:28] stop studying. They stop testing things
[1:59:31] by the scripture.
[1:59:33] They start just settling for a shallow
[1:59:35] version of faith.
[1:59:37] That's what happens.
[1:59:40] And they become very shallow in their
[1:59:41] walk.
[1:59:43] And people begin to reshape sin as a
[1:59:46] personal preference.
[1:59:51] That's all it is. It's just your
[1:59:53] preference. It's not sin. What's right
[1:59:57] for you is right for you. What's wrong
[1:59:58] for you is wrong for you. What's right
[2:00:00] for me is right for me. And what's right
[2:00:01] for me,
[2:00:03] you see, for God understands my heart
[2:00:12] and everybody's journey is different
[2:00:18] and result is we tolerate or we endorse
[2:00:22] sin
[2:00:23] instead of confronting it.
[2:00:27] And the Bible said in in Isaiah 5:20,
[2:00:29] "Woe to them that call evil good and
[2:00:32] good evil."
[2:00:35] And that's the way it will be in this
[2:00:37] last day. And and what happens is is
[2:00:39] then we start viewing the scripture
[2:00:42] through the lens of culture.
[2:00:48] Oh yeah. and and we will avoid
[2:00:50] controversial truths like judgment,
[2:00:53] hell, holiness, gender roles, dress and
[2:00:57] we'll start avoiding that and we'll
[2:00:59] reinterpret scripture to fit modern
[2:01:02] values rather than eternal truths.
[2:01:05] That's accumunism. This is what binding
[2:01:08] them and making them all as one. They
[2:01:10] will all have one mind
[2:01:14] and give themselves to the beast.
[2:01:16] So, we have a world today that their
[2:01:19] personal conviction has been weakened.
[2:01:22] That they no longer stand firm on on on
[2:01:26] the truth of God's Bible. They become
[2:01:28] passive Christians going with the flow
[2:01:31] rather than standing in the gap. Is
[2:01:34] somebody with me this morning? I I you
[2:01:37] know, I I don't understand, you know,
[2:01:39] sometimes a lot about this, but let me
[2:01:41] just make it clear. We are to henceforth
[2:01:44] be no more children
[2:01:47] toss to and fro with every wind of
[2:01:49] doctrine. We got to stand for something
[2:01:51] or we'll fall for anything.
[2:01:54] And when a church loses its passion.
[2:01:57] Amen. Brothers, that's what I keep
[2:01:59] trying to to drill into to those around
[2:02:02] the world. You know, listen, you got to
[2:02:05] have a passion with this. Yeah, but but
[2:02:08] our church just isn't in that
[2:02:09] atmosphere. Well, get it.
[2:02:12] It's available.
[2:02:15] It's made. Come on. It's made a way. The
[2:02:18] word of God preached ought to prod
[2:02:20] produce faith. And faith will produce an
[2:02:22] atmosphere. An atmosphere will bring
[2:02:25] results and souls will be saved. And the
[2:02:28] Holy Spirit will be will preach the word
[2:02:30] in power and people will be delivered
[2:02:33] and set free from sin's bondage.
[2:02:39] Well, brother Tim, our church don't have
[2:02:41] the passion like you. And you know,
[2:02:43] listen, we're not at the example, and
[2:02:45] we're not trying to be your example, but
[2:02:47] I'm just going to tell you, there is a
[2:02:49] word that is an example. And I can take
[2:02:51] you to the upper room where the Holy
[2:02:53] Ghost fell that time. It gave them a
[2:02:56] boldness and a passion and a drive. And
[2:02:59] they got drunk on that new wine. And
[2:03:01] they were influenced by the mighty
[2:03:03] angel. And if you're not influenced by
[2:03:05] this mighty angel and your attitude and
[2:03:07] your atmosphere change, there's
[2:03:09] something wrong with you.
[2:03:14] You're being bound.
[2:03:22] You see, then it gets what was once seen
[2:03:26] as worldly
[2:03:28] is not as seen as harmless.
[2:03:31] entertainment, dress, habits, speech,
[2:03:36] it all becomes indistinguishable from
[2:03:39] the world.
[2:03:43] The line between the holy and profane
[2:03:47] is blurred, erased alto together. And we
[2:03:50] got a scripture that says, "Come out
[2:03:53] from among them and be you separate."
[2:03:58] God's people are being separated.
[2:04:01] That's what a harvest is.
[2:04:04] Amen. It's it's binding you. It's, you
[2:04:07] know, if you're terror, it's pulling you
[2:04:09] into garner. If you're the wheat, it's
[2:04:12] rapturing you up. It's lifting you up.
[2:04:14] Listen, there's a rapture already going
[2:04:16] on. Amen. I don't mean a physical one. I
[2:04:20] don't mean where your body has changed,
[2:04:22] but already inside of you. You have been
[2:04:24] changed. A resurrection is already
[2:04:27] happened in you. You were once dead in
[2:04:29] sins and trespasses, but now you are
[2:04:31] alive.
[2:04:33] You were once in tombs of religion. Come
[2:04:36] on, somebody. Amen. You were in tombs of
[2:04:38] denominations, but no more. Come on,
[2:04:41] somebody. That marquee ain't over your
[2:04:44] door any longer. You're not sitting
[2:04:46] under that tombstone. That's not who you
[2:04:49] are. You're not dead, but you're alive.
[2:05:01] So the idea comes that all roads lead to
[2:05:05] God. Now listen to me said
[2:05:10] the idea comes it don't really make any
[2:05:14] difference.
[2:05:15] Everybody's everyone's truth is valid.
[2:05:20] So nobody has to repent.
[2:05:23] No one has to hear God's voice.
[2:05:26] No one has to study to rightly divide
[2:05:28] the word of God.
[2:05:32] And instead, faith becomes
[2:05:36] a social identity
[2:05:41] rather than a spiritual reality.
[2:05:46] Brother George Weldon from over in South
[2:05:48] Africa, he's an elder friend of mine.
[2:05:52] He's in his 80s. Precious man. He's been
[2:05:56] a pen pal of mine for many, many years.
[2:06:01] We've shared many, many things together.
[2:06:03] The other day, he sent me an NDE.
[2:06:06] You know what that is? Is a near-death
[2:06:09] experience.
[2:06:12] And it was a YouTube
[2:06:14] where this Christian lady
[2:06:18] woman
[2:06:20] always going to church even took notes.
[2:06:25] Maybe even sub for the Sunday school,
[2:06:30] you know, was there on a regular basis.
[2:06:33] Thought she was a pretty good Christian.
[2:06:37] One night she was in a horrible
[2:06:38] accident.
[2:06:40] They couldn't get a heartbeat.
[2:06:43] And for some hours she was dead.
[2:06:53] Instead of going to heaven like she
[2:06:55] thought she went to hell.
[2:07:06] Why am I going to hell? How come heaven
[2:07:08] ain't for me? I was I was a Christian.
[2:07:11] because you were a lukewarm Christian.
[2:07:15] You occupied a pew rather than worshiped
[2:07:18] in the spirit. You took the word and
[2:07:21] read it because it was what you supposed
[2:07:25] to do rather than a drive and a hunger
[2:07:29] and a desire.
[2:07:31] I wonder if how many if they were wound
[2:07:36] up being called what what would really
[2:07:39] be their destiny?
[2:07:44] It's serious
[2:07:47] because harvest time is a separation but
[2:07:50] also
[2:07:51] when you die it's a separation
[2:07:54] and you're not dead.
[2:07:56] You're alive somewhere.
[2:08:00] There has been far too many and even we
[2:08:02] have the examples of the prophet of God
[2:08:04] going beyond the curtain of time that
[2:08:06] that tells us that there is a life
[2:08:09] beyond the river and Jesus was the proof
[2:08:12] of the resurrection that there's life
[2:08:14] after death.
[2:08:18] And so if you if you think about all of
[2:08:20] this, you know, again, you know, where
[2:08:24] would you be? Where you know, well, if
[2:08:27] it's if you question that, where would
[2:08:29] you be when the trumpet sounds?
[2:08:33] Because when we move from this phase
[2:08:35] that we're in, we have had to shout,
[2:08:38] which is a mighty message. We have now
[2:08:42] changed from that glorian to another
[2:08:45] where we're in the voice
[2:08:49] of the archangel.
[2:08:51] That archangel of Revelation 10 hands us
[2:08:54] a book
[2:08:56] and we prophesy again. We are the voice
[2:08:59] of that message.
[2:09:01] We're the voice of those that have been
[2:09:04] in, you know, in the dead, you know,
[2:09:07] from We are We're the voice of those
[2:09:10] that have risen from the dead in the
[2:09:11] tombs of denominationalism.
[2:09:22] Think about where we're at.
[2:09:25] Think about what where where we're at.
[2:09:27] We're on the very cusp of the rapture
[2:09:31] and the next phase is the Trump.
[2:09:37] Do you know what happens at the last
[2:09:39] trump?
[2:09:42] Not Donald Trump.
[2:09:49] Do you know what happens at the la last
[2:09:51] trump? The trump of God shall sound and
[2:09:55] the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[2:10:02] So the trump calls the dead from the
[2:10:04] grave.
[2:10:05] Come on. Actually, it it crescendos so
[2:10:09] much in the bride as the bride's voice
[2:10:12] until it actually becomes the trump
[2:10:16] and it caused the dead in Christ to come
[2:10:19] forward and those in theophony to come
[2:10:22] and take on glorified form, taking up
[2:10:24] their bodies that they laid down here on
[2:10:26] the earth and be united together with it
[2:10:28] and change it in a moment, in a
[2:10:30] twinkling of an eye. And when we see it,
[2:10:32] we're changed to be with them like them.
[2:10:36] And do you realize when that last trump
[2:10:39] sounds
[2:10:42] then we will be caught up to meet him.
[2:10:45] And if you read the book of Revelation,
[2:10:48] the last trump
[2:10:51] says something.
[2:10:56] It's not just a
[2:11:00] It's not playing taps.
[2:11:04] It's not the end of it's not the end.
[2:11:06] It's a new beginning.
[2:11:09] And let me tell you that Trump is
[2:11:11] actually has a voice and that voice is
[2:11:13] saying something. And he says at the end
[2:11:15] of the leodyian age, the door was
[2:11:18] opened. An entrance was made into
[2:11:21] heaven. And that's what this message
[2:11:22] does. It provides a way in.
[2:11:26] And when the door is open, I heard a
[2:11:28] voice saying like a trumpet. And it
[2:11:31] says, it says, "Come up hither."
[2:11:37] Are you with me? That's what the trump
[2:11:39] says. It is the summons to leave the
[2:11:43] earth and be caught up to meet the Lord
[2:11:45] in the air. And we're right here where
[2:11:48] the voice becomes the trump.
[2:11:55] We're that close.
[2:12:04] kind of resounds within me right now
[2:12:11] this week. You know, you always I always
[2:12:14] pray, Lord, give me a visitation. Let me
[2:12:18] hear your voice. Speak to me, whether
[2:12:20] dream, vision, however, hear your voice.
[2:12:23] I've heard his voice many times.
[2:12:27] I've had spiritual dreams, very few very
[2:12:30] very few visions.
[2:12:36] The other morning I got up at 1:00 in
[2:12:40] the morning
[2:12:45] and
[2:12:47] I was thinking of Israel and what they
[2:12:49] were going through and all of the wars
[2:12:52] that were, you know, the bombardments
[2:12:54] and the firing back of the enemy and
[2:12:56] what they were doing trying to preserve
[2:12:59] their homeland and trying to wipe out
[2:13:02] the demonic regime of those who were
[2:13:05] saying death to Israel,
[2:13:09] threatening to wipe them off the face of
[2:13:12] the earth. And I was tempted I was
[2:13:16] tempted just to to to grab my phone or
[2:13:20] my computer one and read the news. What
[2:13:24] is happening? What is going on? But I
[2:13:27] didn't. I laid back down and I went to
[2:13:30] sleep.
[2:13:33] And as I was sleeping there in just
[2:13:36] those few moments because it happened
[2:13:39] only in just 15 minutes because I would
[2:13:42] wake up again, look at the clock
[2:13:49] and I I I felt the spirit of God come
[2:13:53] upon me and I in in the stream and I I
[2:13:58] fell to the floor and I was kneeling
[2:14:00] there and I was repenting. I was saying,
[2:14:03] "Oh, God, I'm sorry that I haven't been
[2:14:06] in more and in tune more that I could
[2:14:10] hear your voice. We so need to hear it."
[2:14:12] And I was just repenting in that moment
[2:14:15] prostrate on my on my knees there in the
[2:14:17] stream and laying there right there
[2:14:20] beside my bed. And as I did, I did my
[2:14:24] whole body began to vibrate and I began
[2:14:26] to speak in other tongues. at first
[2:14:29] stammer, stammer, unintelligent
[2:14:32] stammering and then speaking in other
[2:14:34] tongues and then it come out of my
[2:14:37] mouth. The angels of the Lord are with
[2:14:41] you. They are here. Thousands of angels
[2:14:45] have been dispatched for you. I tell you
[2:14:48] church, we're not here in this battle
[2:14:49] alone. We're not here by ourselves. But
[2:14:53] as I heard that that voice, it was
[2:14:55] thousands of voices flowing through me
[2:14:58] at one time and a harmonious song like
[2:15:01] it was. It wasn't a song, but it was so
[2:15:04] harmonious of thousands of voices coming
[2:15:08] right through my lips. I tell you
[2:15:10] friends, well, all the thousands of the
[2:15:12] scripture ought to be flowing to our
[2:15:15] lips this morning. Amen. I'm
[2:15:17] acknowledging we are not alone and we
[2:15:20] are not by oursel. And as we rise up as
[2:15:23] lions, we are not alone. But the lion of
[2:15:27] the tribe of Judah has prevailed. He has
[2:15:30] brought every promise. Amen. And he is
[2:15:32] here for deliverance.
[2:15:42] Oh my.
[2:15:45] What an hour.
[2:15:47] What a day.
[2:15:50] You see,
[2:15:53] there's a binding.
[2:15:55] A binding. A binding, yes. But a binding
[2:16:01] that is going on. And it's lukewarmness.
[2:16:07] Churches will become lukewarm with no
[2:16:09] passion, no drive, and they will make
[2:16:12] excuses and try to kill those who have
[2:16:16] passion.
[2:16:21] They're being identified.
[2:16:26] You see that binding promotes peace over
[2:16:30] purity,
[2:16:32] tolerance over truth,
[2:16:35] leads to lukewarmness.
[2:16:38] have no spiritual hunger,
[2:16:41] no hunger for holiness, for more of God,
[2:16:45] a life lifestyle that just blends in
[2:16:47] rather than stands out.
[2:16:50] First thing you know, there's compromise
[2:16:52] in marriage, in friendships, in church
[2:16:55] involvement, and and even even your
[2:16:58] choices of media, music, everything
[2:17:01] else, whatever you're feeding on.
[2:17:05] But I tell you what, Titus 2:1 says that
[2:17:10] the grace of God teaches us denying
[2:17:12] ungodliness and worldly lust, we should
[2:17:15] live soberly and righteously and godly
[2:17:20] in this present world. You see, God
[2:17:23] wants a people who are separated. Not
[2:17:26] not isolated, not out as hermits or
[2:17:29] monks hiding in the back woods. Amen.
[2:17:32] but separated,
[2:17:33] a holy people, but but not hottie. Come
[2:17:37] on, somebody. Not know it all, but
[2:17:40] people who are faith and of full of
[2:17:42] faith and love and truth, and they're
[2:17:45] deeply rooted in the word of God, and
[2:17:48] they're not tossed about by trends,
[2:17:52] by spiritual fads.
[2:17:54] You know, that's something that always I
[2:17:56] watch, you know, with our youth camp and
[2:17:59] you'll see the young people there always
[2:18:01] get
[2:18:03] caught up in fads,
[2:18:08] trends,
[2:18:10] and it changes from one year to the
[2:18:12] next. when a few years ago the trends of
[2:18:17] that what Britney Spears or whatever
[2:18:19] showing her naval and all her nonsense
[2:18:22] and then you see message girls come to
[2:18:24] camp and they can't even raise their
[2:18:26] hands because they're showing half their
[2:18:27] belly
[2:18:31] trends.
[2:18:34] We're not to be
[2:18:36] tossed about by every trend that comes
[2:18:38] along.
[2:18:41] You know, you don't pick up everything
[2:18:43] that comes along. You judge it by the
[2:18:45] word and say, "What am I being
[2:18:47] identified with?"
[2:18:50] Amen. But I wanted you to know, God has
[2:18:52] not left himself in this day without a
[2:18:54] voice in the land. From this last day,
[2:18:57] there has come a forerunner with a
[2:18:59] message to prepare the way of the Lord,
[2:19:02] just as prophesied in Malachi 4:5 and 6.
[2:19:05] Behold, I send to you Elijah the prophet
[2:19:08] before the coming of that great and
[2:19:10] dreadful day. You said, "But you know,
[2:19:12] you're you're a little dark this
[2:19:13] morning. The way you're preaching be the
[2:19:15] Bible declares it'll be a great and a
[2:19:18] dreadful day of the Lord." I'm going to
[2:19:22] say it's going to be great for some and
[2:19:24] dreadful for others. It depends on where
[2:19:27] you're being gathered.
[2:19:29] Amen. Some it'll be great. It's going to
[2:19:32] be a great day when we see the dead in
[2:19:34] Christ rise. It's going to be a great
[2:19:36] day when we're changed in a moment and a
[2:19:39] twinkling of an eye. It's going to be a
[2:19:40] great day when we, like Sarah, have our
[2:19:43] last life and the promised son comes.
[2:19:47] Hallelujah. That'll be a great day. But
[2:19:49] for others, it'll be a dreadful day.
[2:19:56] And the earth, the Bible said, will burn
[2:19:58] as an oven. Atomic fire will take it
[2:20:01] all.
[2:20:07] Let me tell you something. The message
[2:20:09] we received is not another man's
[2:20:11] tradition.
[2:20:13] It's not a church dogma.
[2:20:16] It's a return to the apostolic word.
[2:20:20] The faith that was once delivered to the
[2:20:21] saints.
[2:20:23] It will restore the hearts of the
[2:20:25] children back to their Pentecostal
[2:20:26] fathers. And if it don't restore you
[2:20:28] back to that, you missed it.
[2:20:31] And I and I'm not talking about an
[2:20:33] emotional experience only, but to a
[2:20:35] wordbased spiritfilled overcoming life.
[2:20:39] With the restoration of the word comes
[2:20:41] the restoration of the power. Not a
[2:20:44] powerless profession, but a a bride with
[2:20:47] oil in her lamps. You know what oil is?
[2:20:50] It's the energy for the fire. Amen.
[2:20:54] Maybe if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[2:20:56] on the inside of you, you don't have
[2:20:57] energy for the fire. But if the Holy
[2:21:00] Ghost is in there, it is the dynamic
[2:21:02] energy that puts a fire out of you that
[2:21:06] light a light in the time of darkness.
[2:21:15] For it's not by might nor by power, but
[2:21:17] it's by my spirit, sayeth the Lord of
[2:21:20] hosts.
[2:21:22] What is the Lord of hosts? Lord of
[2:21:23] armies.
[2:21:27] Time is no longer
[2:21:30] for we have reached the end of the ages.
[2:21:34] The wheat and the tears are being
[2:21:36] separated.
[2:21:38] The call has come forth. Come out of
[2:21:41] her, my people.
[2:21:44] Well, I I left the church and I come
[2:21:46] here. No. Come out of her
[2:21:49] thinking,
[2:21:52] her atmosphere, her ways.
[2:21:56] A lot of people follow Jesus and you
[2:21:58] know and even even there were many of
[2:22:01] them that that were Pharisees which
[2:22:03] believed and I've als chapter 15. The
[2:22:06] Pharisees which believe said we ought to
[2:22:09] be you know circumcised them as a after
[2:22:12] the law of Moses
[2:22:14] when they're concerning the Gentiles.
[2:22:17] And I've often looked at that scripture.
[2:22:18] I said well how did there be Pharisees?
[2:22:24] How could there be Pharisees in the New
[2:22:28] Testament church
[2:22:31] counted as believers,
[2:22:34] elders
[2:22:36] who were saying they were in the meeting
[2:22:38] with elders saying what a circumcising
[2:22:42] you know physical circumcising Pharisees
[2:22:45] which believed. How did that happen?
[2:22:48] I'll tell you how it happened. They
[2:22:50] bypassed the new birth.
[2:22:53] When you get the Holy Ghost, you're no
[2:22:55] longer Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian,
[2:22:57] Catholic, or whatever. Their ways are
[2:22:58] gone. Then you got the ways like they
[2:23:00] had on the day of Pentecost. You think
[2:23:02] about the word like they did on the day
[2:23:03] of Pentecost. You act like they did on
[2:23:06] the day of Pentecost. Somebody help me
[2:23:08] preach. Amen. You're no longer
[2:23:10] identified with the tombs of religion.
[2:23:12] You are identified with Christ and his
[2:23:15] word.
[2:23:18] The climax of the harvest.
[2:23:22] This is not just a random event. This is
[2:23:24] just not happen stance. This has been
[2:23:27] orchestrated and pre-planned by God.
[2:23:30] He's been waiting for this moment.
[2:23:34] This is a crowning moment.
[2:23:38] It's a bride who is his crowning
[2:23:40] achievement.
[2:23:42] We have been pre-planned
[2:23:45] because he planted the seed and is now
[2:23:47] harvest.
[2:23:49] and and and
[2:23:52] this harvest time. We are the great
[2:23:53] climax of God's redemptive plans.
[2:23:57] And this has is what the ages have been
[2:24:01] moving forward. And for this very
[2:24:03] climax, we have come into this harvest
[2:24:06] season. And now the final cycle is upon
[2:24:09] us. And the harvest must be completed.
[2:24:13] And during this growing season, there is
[2:24:17] silence and there's patience and there's
[2:24:20] development of the crop. But when
[2:24:23] harvest time comes,
[2:24:25] something changes.
[2:24:27] The silence of growth gives way to the
[2:24:31] noise of the sickle.
[2:24:34] The shout of the reapers and the joy of
[2:24:37] the master in the field. Friends, the
[2:24:40] silence is broken.
[2:24:43] Come on. We're right now in the seventh
[2:24:45] seal where the silence has been broken
[2:24:49] and and the and the silence of growth of
[2:24:52] the seven ages has given way to the
[2:24:55] noise of the sickle, the shout of the
[2:24:58] reapers, the joy of the master of the
[2:25:01] field. As Joel chapter 3 says, "Put in
[2:25:05] the sickle for the harvest is ripe and
[2:25:08] come get you down for the press is full
[2:25:10] and the fats overflow for their
[2:25:13] wickedness is great."
[2:25:15] You see, there's a holy excitement in
[2:25:19] the harvest because what was planted is
[2:25:24] now come to full maturity.
[2:25:26] The seed produced of its kind, the long
[2:25:30] season of waiting is over.
[2:25:35] Hallelujah. Ain't that wonderful, Sister
[2:25:37] Jeanie? We've been waiting for this
[2:25:39] time, hadn't we? We're here in this hour
[2:25:41] where the long season of waiting is
[2:25:44] over.
[2:25:46] That can be true for you this morning.
[2:25:48] You've been waiting on your miracle.
[2:25:50] Amen. The long season of waiting is
[2:25:52] over. Amen. thrust in the sickle, reap
[2:25:57] the harvest. The benefits are there.
[2:25:59] It's all in the word. Somebody help me
[2:26:02] preach. Amen. It ought to give way for
[2:26:04] from silence to now the joy of the
[2:26:07] reapers.
[2:26:08] Hallelujah. The Lord of the harvest is
[2:26:11] here, Jesus Christ himself. And he's
[2:26:13] been waiting with divine anticipation
[2:26:16] for this very hour. And now he's about
[2:26:19] to gather his bride. We've seen the
[2:26:22] tears being gathered. We see the
[2:26:24] ecumenical system. We see the spirit
[2:26:26] that's binding. But I'm telling you,
[2:26:28] there's a there's something that is also
[2:26:30] gathering the wheat and pulling her into
[2:26:33] the garner. What is gathering her is not
[2:26:36] a communical spirit. It's the Holy
[2:26:38] Spirit. And the outpouring of the Holy
[2:26:40] Ghost is gathering a people, a bride in
[2:26:43] this evening time. Hallelujah. I say,
[2:26:45] "Let it pour out upon us. Pour it out
[2:26:48] upon me." Amen. Cuz he will gather his
[2:26:50] bride, that wrapped ripened grain. He'll
[2:26:53] carry into the great grain elevator of
[2:26:56] glory into the eternal garner of God.
[2:26:59] Hallelujah. What a day that will be.
[2:27:02] What an hour we are living in. Amen. I
[2:27:05] hear the sound of the sickle coming.
[2:27:08] Brother Brandham even said himself when
[2:27:10] he was here with prophetic ears. He
[2:27:12] said, "I can hear the coming of the
