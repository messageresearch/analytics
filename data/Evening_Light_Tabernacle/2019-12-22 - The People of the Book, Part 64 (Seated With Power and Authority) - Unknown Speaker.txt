you're our Lord we have come today to act in your name but we are the sons of God thank you Father for the privilege of serving you thank you for this time that we can come and worship you thank you as these men and women stand in attention for the word to be read oh God as they stand to honor the word that we are about to read they're not standing in honor of some man they're standing in the honor of the Almighty God whose word has preeminence in our lives whose word never fails is always true you know God who you never fail them to bring your word to pass in our lives what am i some wonderful God and Savior we serve we're looking to you today as we open up the pages of the Bible and we look into the Word of God we're looking for you to step out of eternity down into time just for a moment again and anoint those of us that are here in your presence and anoint the word and speak them again for you said the words that I speak they are spirit and they are life and we're expecting never work to go like an arrow to its target we're looking forward to hit the bull's eye and slaughter every enemy and then feed every foe and so that the name of Jesus will be championed among the people of God we look to you God because you are worthy the air when the book was held in the hand of him that sat on the throne there came forth a man who was worthy we know there was no worthy man here so God left the throne of glory to become a man to walk down among us Lord they were looking for a savior from Rome but you had something bigger in mind to save us from sin and therefore sickness Lord you had something bigger in mind but it came so humble and she came down in a manger and that you know God would grow up as a man and experience things Mantua does and then voluntarily to surrender yourself that body that was built that was fathered by God so it was a son and that son would come in obedience to the Father's will to be filled with the Father himself Lord we're here today in obedience to your word and we know Lord you're on the scene to make every word of yours true because not one word of yours can return to you void it will accomplish what you sent it to do and we are ordained of God for this moment in this time and we stand here as the children of God taking our position in the promise of the word of God and we just put Satan on notice you are defeated and we will realize your defeat this day as we proclaim it in the name of the Lord Jesus and take for ourselves of promises that belong to us bless those Lord that are that are with us today from around the world from some from India Africa South Africa different places Lord around the globe Europe America Canada wherever they are many of them have their services today have just come to be blessed again by your presence may you bless them in a real and living way I pray make the Word of God real to us we ask in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you amen well just turn over and wish somebody Merry Christmas man I want to wish every one of you a Merry Christmas here those of you that are here and around the world as we pause to remember the greatest gift God gave but let's not present him as a God of history but let's see him as a God of the present he's not a babe in a manger he's a resurrected Lord and as Lord he is champion over ever devil ever disease ever sinned and ever sickness for all have to bow to his name a man and his believers let us be like Israel of old who were led by the cloud of fire prophetic utterance miracles and signs and god-given wonders a man and this was to be accomplished by God selected God ordained and God equipped and God sent men with a whole camp being dominated by a Holy Ghost smooth Amen are you ready to be dominated by Holy Ghost move today hey man I want to just yield my vessel to Helmand you yield your vessel to him today and say all gods speak man and let us be recipients of that divine grace amen god bless you thank you for all the wonderful singing today I'm gonna go right back to the scriptures that we have been ministering on numbers chapter 33 verse 53 because I don't believe we got everything out of this we need to get immense I believe that the Lord has another portion for us today we'll also be looking at the book of John chapter 15 so number 33 verse 53 when Israel would come to the promised land they would find that this promised land was already possessed but they had to kick out the inhabitants of the land and I want you to understand as we read the scripture today we have our promised land which is the word of God and ever demon of Hell wants to camp down on it and say it's not for you you cannot possess it amen so we come to the promised land and we already see there's a devil sitting right there on there trying to tell you you can have it but I've got a word from the Lord for you and ye shall dispossessed the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the land to possess it why not amazing God an amazing word and it's ever been true hey man then I want to go to John chapter 15 verse 7 if you abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples amen god bless you you can be seated we're going to be speaking this morning on seated with power and authority these words that we have read from the book of John if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be here and my father is glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples these words are the description of every child of God that is filled with the Holy Ghost they are the children of God our fruit bearing men and women of faith not only do they deny the works of the flesh they are led by the spirit and they are not under the law and they're not under sins Dominion in Galatians 5:19 tells us the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness Rebellion's of such like other which I told you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god but you see those that are connected to the vine they bear these fruits verse 22 but the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance all of them describes who you really are the child of God glorifies the father as we bear fruit or we give evidence to abiding in the branch we are a people of Dominion unbelief in all types of sin does not have dominion over us yet we know there are people today who claim the Holy Ghost and yet there's no keeping power in their life and the Bible tells us that would be those kind because it said men would have a form of godliness but denied the power thereof so how can we say that one can commit sins of adultery and fornication or homosexual acts and still have the Holy Ghost when you receive the Holy Ghost the desire of sin is gone because sin nature is dead first Corinthians six and nine it tells you who will not inherit the kingdom of God said the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators adulterers adulterers effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and now what we have just read to you is every one of these are willful sins and the understand and that was a condition we were all in I'm glad there's a God who forgive us of our iniquities ma'am but but verse 11 says and such were some of you but you are washed but you were sanctified but you are justified which means you are declared righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God you know we don't need to make excuses for sins some will take the Bible in Romans 7 where it said that I find the law that when I would do good evil is present with me and that because of the flesh that we have to drag something that is unconverted along with us all you know that then we can't help but do what is wrong but I want you to understand that sin is the result of sin dwelling in you and Paul is not talking about a man in his field with the Holy Ghost but someone who is who is still sold in slavery to sin and one who still has sin abiding within them and this man will say I wanted to write and I delight in the law but I just can't live it with my mind I want to do right but with sin nature of my place I can't do it and so that is a wretched condition that all humanity is in and was in and until Jesus came and this is what Paul would say all wretched man who will deliver me from this body of say here lies the answer I think God Jesus Christ my lord so there is therefore an inoculation for them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and I'm talking to men and women today that I believe are walking in the spirit now I would like to review or look at Romans say as 6 and verse 1 and let's just read some of this and I've just got some things to lay some foundation on this morning as we get into our subject of being seated with power and authority as a verse 1 says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound but how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein no you're not that so many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him in in by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we should walk in the newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection so you know this is our very type of baptism you don't you don't bury somebody that is alive you bury someone who's dead and so it's a very type that we fulfill in baptism that we were saying the old man is dead and we are we're bearing him and razan again to the newness of life so he says here I'm knowing that said our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freedom from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead died the more and death had no more dominion over him for in that heat I did he he died under sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God likewise reckon yourself ye yourselves to be dead indeed to sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord and listen to this next verse let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body a man that you should obey it in the lusts thereof what a word that is given what an understanding that is being given to know that our body is no longer the servant of sin and sin can no longer have rule or reign over you it is no longer the dwelling place of sin nature but it is now the temple of the Holy Ghost so we know that where our sins are cleansed and forgiven and we no longer desire to do things wrong but it always remains this question that comes up every so often does Christian sin well here's what the Bible says in Hebrews 10:26 for if we sin wilfully after that we have received that knowledge of the truth that remaineth no more sacrifice for sins that is if we sin on purpose after receiving the knowledge of the truth the blood doesn't cleanse us there's no sacrifice available to ones that are have been labelled and have received the knowledge of the truth and to continue on in sin and keep doing the wrong things and evil things there's no sacrifice for that the blood is to keep those from from sin who is walking in faith and man who is overcoming in their lives because sin nature is dead if we are part of Christ if we abide in Christ we do not sin willfully or our own purpose so let no man deceive you here if you're righteous by the cleansing of the blood you do what is right if we commit sin willfully we're not yet born again but we're still at the devil hey man we need a cleansing from sin nature and that's the very reason that Jesus came was to destroy the works of the devil that is to destroy sin and it's shameful disease our deeds and if we're born again we cannot sin because the seed of God has been awakened in us and we cannot sin willfully because we are born of God and there's a new life in us that brings harm our very flesh under the control of the Holy Spirit this is what he said in John 2 and 1 first John 2 and 1 my little children these things I write unto you that you seem not so why would John tell us not to sin if we have no power to keep from sinning this alone shows who are the children of God who still belongs to the devil if someone is still willfully sinning he's unconverted and sin shall has dominion over him you remember there in John 15:7 what we what we read if you abide in me if you abide in me and my words abide in you look at first John the verse first John three and six who's ever abided him in him sinneth not who's ever sinneth had not seen him neither known him little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil who sever is born of God did not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God in this - children of God are manifest in the children of devil who does not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother so however God knows that we have a converted soul we still live in a body of flesh that is not converted and we're constantly tempted to do wrong hey man I'll tell you if I would ask you for a hand to be raised every person in this building would raise if I ask you how many this this week has been tempted to do wrong you've been tempted to disbelieve and then you have been tempted to commit to commit something that is sinful synonymy but yet sin desire is gone but we still walk in the path of this world and sin abounds everywhere and man it's like can I can I just explain it like a farmer would it's like an ax manure along the path we see it we avoid it but sometimes we didn't see it and we step in it we don't do it willfully because it's nasty and we quickly clean it off our feet hey man but to the believer sin is disgusting it's even more disgusting than animal manure you don't put your foot in it and purpose and if you do stepping in accidentally you wash it out real quickly and the same with sin a true believer will never sin on purpose and as we walk in this life all along the path Satan is there to trap us we sin we didn't pray enough by misuse of her time we sinned by allowing things to upset us we sinned by having doubts and fear we sinned hey man and for this we have an advocate a man who intercedes on our behalf I'm glad to have an advocate Amen that makes up for our for our lacks in our humanity first on June 1 my little children these things write unto you that you see not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is a perpetuation for our sin and not only fires only but also for the sins of the whole world so what's the difference between willful sin and a mistake a mistake is something you didn't mean to do and was not willfully done let me give you some examples of willful sin to smoke a cigarette I have to sin willfully I have to think about it I have to purchase it I have to pick it up I have to light it i all kinds of steps that i have to go through i go through every kind of warning every kind of thought telling me don't do that don't do that even on the package it says don't do that hey man you have to willfully unconsciously decide I want to smoke a cigarette you know using drugs and alcohol you have to willfully unconsciously go and buy and then inject yourself with drugs or alcohol and it man not having sex with someone you're not married to this is willful sin lying on purpose you think about it make up a lie you know purposely looking at pornography adultery is willful sin and that's adultery but but of course this doesn't mean that we as Christians never make a mistake or do things wrong no it means that the Holy Ghost dwells within us and our nature and desires are changed and the blood then covers all of our mistakes aren't you glad for the blood it means that the Holy Ghost abides and that is our anchor during the hour of temptation and in those times he makes a way of escape it means it means that he abides to convince us of what is sin and brings us quickly to obedience to the will and the word of God it means that every day we crucify and keep dead the will of the flesh hey man no ma I think as it is that my mind just goes back to Eden a moment back in Eden God saw his son Adam become a slave to sin nature what a horrible day that was sin made Adam hide from God sin made him insane sin made him make excuses and blame even ultimately blame God saying the woman thou has given me but can you imagine the joy of the father that he has today watching you overcome a man that you are now a branch in the vine when you were once a servant of sin that you you you now are no longer a slave to sin Romans 8:11 said but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised Christ from the dead also quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth within you 2nd Corinthians 6:16 says you are the Temple of the Living God I'm talking about who you are not who you were I'm talking about who you are I mean you are the Temple of the Living God as God said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people obeisance 3:17 says that Christ may dwell in your heart by faith you being rooted and grounded in love 1st John 4 and 13 says here but know you that we dwell in him and he and us because he has given of us his spirit hey man what a wonderful thing it is to say I'm sealed hey man the Holy Spirit is sealed my life and he's in and the devil is shut out I don't bomb the devil my body don't even belong to him my spirit doesn't bond to him nothing of myself belongs to the devil in the breach between the church Jesus and the seals brother Branham said you've always heard me saved the people said that that what made me do this no no the devil didn't do it you just wasn't seal them because when you're sealed in he's sealed out yeah now you went up to him my honey he couldn't get into you because the only way to get into you is through the same process that you have he would have to be saved sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and then he'd be your brother so you see he didn't do it not all you just went to the borderline and come back lusting for the things of the world you never went all the way in the cane and you see across Jordan to death to yourself he would also explain this in the token message the Bible said he this morning God did not commit sin for he careth sin for the seed of God a man remains in him and how can he send when the sinless God is in him and when he is in a sinless God how can he send no matter what he's done the Bloods covered him see he's a new creature now his desires and ambitions is of heaven because he's changed from a cuckoo bird till we his desires ain't the same as it once was and he displayed it and you say oh I believe that and still sinning no your deceit see it can't display nothing but the token and we know that's the literal life of Jesus Christ I'd like to look at first John 2:27 and I want to remind you from what we were speaking last week that this anointing that we have received as different from the anointing of the Old Testament in that that there was not a proper sacrifice it could take away sin and then give back his nature but about this anointing that you have it is a life that abides look at verse 27 but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and his truth and is no lie as it hath taught you you shall abide in him and now little children abide in him that he went he shall appear we mount company of to not be ashamed before him at his coming we are born again how many can say this Lord I'm glad I'm born again a man well if you're born again Ephesians 2:10 says we are his workmanship we are created in Christ Jesus to good works and which God hath ordained that we should walk in them Ephesians 4 21 says if so be that you heard him and have been taught by him and the truth is in Jesus that you put off the former conversation the conduct behavior the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness Romans 6:6 we read this knowing that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth or from now on we should not serve sin but he that is dead is freed from sin and man Colossians 3 of mine said senior put off the old man with his deeds and put on the new man which is renewed and knowledge up to the image of him that created him and then I would like to look at your church age and the revelation of deity God's personal revelation of himself to your age wrong a Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 and to the Angel of the Church of Laodicea write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God so now the book of Revelation here are revelation of God to this age is specific to us that Christ is the beginning of the creation of God and the truest God condescended from from spirit to look to the apne and as the thoughts of God was released from the word the logos in dude theophany form and by the words God framed the world so he was the beginner are the author of the creation of God there was this was not one person creating the second person of God but this was because that would make God Jesus lower than God had a man but these words here the beginner or the author of the creation of God so we know thirty that Jesus is God he's very God he is a creator all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and he's the one who said in Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the heavens on the earth it also says in Exodus 20 and 11 for six days the Lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that is in them is and rested the seventh day so there's no doubt he is the creator and he was the creator of a finished physical creation amen so we can see what these words mean to have any other interpretation would mean God created God so how could God be creative when he himself is a creator but now he's standing in the midst of his church here in the seven days and the enemy stands revealing who he is in this last stage and he calls himself the author of the creation of God and this now is not the same creation of Genesis one this is a new creation remember the Old Covenant had a creation the New Covenant also has a creation a map by man and this this new creation start with de learn I Manfred said in the beginning in the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh somebody with me so the new creation would be me would start with the word and he would produce sons of the word remember that first creation would create a life and bringing them to the image of God was upon the earth and the new creation does the same it begins with the word and if from that word is persons and out of that word comes more sons and more sons and more sons Alleluia now so this is another creation you can look at your body and you can see it's the old order of creation it will have to be changed hey man but you that have been birth within your soul you are not that soul is not of the old order of creation that creation is a fallen creation that creation is a slave to sin that creation is under the domination of sin but the new creation is not under since - since Dominion unbelief cannot stand doubt cannot rule it hallelujah are you with me Amanda it is of a new creation and that creation he started with God coming town in a virgin and there would overshadow a virgin and then from that from that work that he did of that creation out of him now would come the rest of his creation now isn't that what God did in the beginning he unfolded himself from spirit untimed to where he would come to sin in the word and from word he would create all things hallelujah hey man and then I have this one this is what God does he can't dissent and it takes on human flats and the word becomes flesh and then from that word he will create all things my friends you're under Europe another creation you're not at the creation of failure you're of a new creation and then with this creation doesn't know the word failure and man it is a word it is a creation we're in sons of God dominate not we're sons of God become dominating this is a creation that cast Satan out not a creation that comes under his reign a man now so brother Branham would say in the church age book this is a new creation another creation has to do with the church is a special designation of himself he is a creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as a spirit of God he came down created in the Virgin Mary the cells of from which he was born I want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body and it wasn't enough for those who spirit just simply to give life to human ovum supplied by Mary that would not have been or that would have been sinful mankind produced in the body a man that would not have that would not have produced the last atom of him and it said lo a body hast thou father prepared me so God not Mary provided that body Mary was a human incubator and she carried the Holy Child and brought him to birth it was in God man he was the son of God he was of the new creation and man and God met and joined he was the first of this new race I want to talk about Jesus for a little while a man he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race and then this is the god race are you with me Colossians 1:18 says and she is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead hallelujah that in all things he might have the preeminence a man 2nd Corinthians 5:17 since therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creation and all things are passed away and behold all things have become new a man now therefore you can see that no man was of the old order of creation now in union with Christ he have become of the new creation of God Ephesians 2:10 says we are his workmanship created in union with Christ Jesus under good works verse 24 of chapter 4 of Ephesians says and that you put on the new man which is created in righteousness and true holiness now I'm establishing you if the word of God because this isn't something I said about you this isn't something your mama said about you this isn't something brother Branham said about you this is something God said about you and that's where your faith has got a rasp is in the eternal Word of God now this new creation is not of the old creation that creates and fell and it's not one that's made over we've got to the other one and made it into something else it couldn't be called a creative new creation but it's what it is it is exactly what it says it's a new creation a - another creation distinct from the past distinct from the old one because the old one doesn't have a shred of claim on the new creation hallelujah a man he don't deal with us in this creation like he dealt with Abraham amount of Abraham's issue would come a godly soul a lineage but now it's not this Abraham and Abraham's race and the fleshly lineage but now from his issue by the Holy Spirit a man out of every kindred and tribe and nation he has purposed for himself on new creation and he's the first of that new creation he was God created in the form of map and now by his Spirit he's created many sons unto himself God the Creator created himself a part of his creation Ephesians 1:15 I'd like to look at this because it's here we're going to draw our foundation for our message today therefore always I always have to hurry your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the Saints do not cease to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being lightened that you might know what is the hope of his calling and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he brought worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his own right hand in the heavenly places for above all principalities and power and might and Dominion and every name that is named not only in this age but in that which is to come now I want you to notice of this new creation where is he placed he is placed to be therefore above all principalities and power and might and Dominion and every name you just think of it whatever name you want to say whatever sin you want to say whatever disease you want to say whatever sickness you want to say Amen every one of them every name that is named not only for them but for now not only for that age but for this age hallelujah PO uses the word principalities and power to describe demons and evil spirits he uses the same terminology later in in his letter in verse 12 of chapter 6 and several we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this age against spiritual hosts of wickedness in heavenly places so you see Paul is showing us showing us that Jesus sits on the right hand of the Father and he is far above every evil spirit or ever demon or ever fallen angel or any kind of spirits of being or evil being that exists come on now he is seated far above our powers hey man now you know in a kingdom being seated by the right hand of the king is the highest position available hey man there's no higher rent than this and since the kingdom of God is the greatest Kingdom and since there's no authority in existence that is higher than God then we know that be seated at his right is to be in a place of unmatched authority this is where the new creation is placed with honor Master Authority Amen Jesus has absolute unconditional authority over every demon over ever sin over ever sickness hallelujah amen Philippians two and five says let the mind that being you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation took it upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion of man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross a man oh what a day that was when God watched earth that had been cursed possessed by another men by the will of a man who walked down to the River Jordan in obedience to the will of the father to be filled with the Holy Ghost are you with me amen look now wherefore God has highly exalted him and gave him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus ever needs a bath of things in heaven of things on the earth and things under the earth hey man I don't care where the devil's hiding I don't care where he's hiding today he's got a bow my knee baby's there Shona fighting in heaven over our position he's got a bow if he's here on the earth tormenting you he's got a bali he's in hell he's got acknowledged the name of Jesus every knee has to bow a man then at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in things in heaven thins and earth things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord ruler King with authority and power to the glory of God the Father hallelujah every devil every cancer ever affliction every demon he's got about the knee to this name and obey no exceptions no matter how big the name no matter I feared the name no matter how many others he's tapping over this Lord of ours is champion of champions he is Lord of lords his name is above all names his name every demon house to bow and every tongue has to confess that he indeed is the ruler he rules over Sam he rules over sickness he rules over disease he rules over every demon power named him he has to bow to the faith of Jesus Christ and acknowledge Hebrew Ephesians 1:20 says which he walked worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at a sauna at his right hand in heavenly places far above all principalities and power and might and Dominion and every name that is named not only in this age but also that which is to come a man we know now we know that spiritual things are just as real as physical things a man let me say that again we know that spiritual things are just as real as physical things we know that spiritual things are superior due to physical things for God a spirit created all physical things so we know that greater is He that is in us then he that is in the world we know that the greater one is the master of sickness he's the master of disease he's a master of weaknesses hey man now but you you know we many times wouldn't you say but that was just for Jesus but I want to remind you that it was not just for Jesus Jesus Jesus came as the head of the new creation for there to be many brethren hey ma'am this will you see I mean he'll already had all of this him as as God he becomes man to become the captain of our salvation I meant to lead us into deliverance to give us the victory over sin over death over hell over the grave I'm not over sickness over disease hey man now I want you to as we stop here just for a minute and pause on this because well again I want to go back and just realize again that spiritual things are more real than the physical things because every physical thing was made from the spiritual hey man the Bible said things that are made were made but things that are not seen hey man so therefore in the word which who which which could only be seen by the eyes of faith that's the only way it can be seen the natural senses don't declare the earthly man doesn't declare God that's why we're not looking for our earth live census to declare God we're looking for faith to declare him a man now so you see as we have read it now I just want to get it far above all principalities power might Dominion and every name that is named not only in this age but in that which is to come notice this and he put all things under his feet and gave him to be head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him who fills all in all so let's look exactly what he said he put everything under his feet and gave him to be head over all things to the church and the church is his body so he put it under his feet he put it under the feet of the church j-man oh my that's what the book of Romans said and the glommit peace shall bruise Satan under your feet hallelujah Ephesians two and one the next verse actually after this one I just read and here and you he had made alive who were dead in trespasses and sins in which you once weren't walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now works in the sons of disobedience among whom we all once conducted ourselves and the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath just as the other oh but I like this amen oh my this man is high this is a kind of a bleak deal we we all look at the love where we conducted ourselves and the lust serve less fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and words as children of Wrath but that's not the end of the story but God God I was diving sin but God I was sick with disease [Music] hallelujah don't you realize Church what it all is and some of you were doomed to death a man who is rich in mercy whose mercy that ran out whose mercy is for guests day and age in this moment at this time that disservice God who is rich in mercy for the great love wherewith he loved us are you feeling love because even when you were dead in sins and man he made you alive together with Christ and by grace by his favor he saved you hallelujah a man and he raised us up together have made us to sit together we're in heavenly places in Christ Jesus right where he is in union with Jesus Christ you are enthroned and ruling from the nether dimension over sin over sickness over evil it's not just him sitting on the throne that's the first of the new creation but everyone recreated in Christ Jesus sits on the throne with him hallelujah as believers we're in the same seat of authority that Jesus occupies we are with Christ and we are also in Christ this is a place that is far above every demon ever fallen angel every evil spirit and even Lucifer himself that's where you're seated over every devil over every sickness over every disease named him you're higher than him [Applause] you got more authority than him you got more rights than him now just as Adam was given dominion over every living creature in Eden God has chosen to give us his beloved children in this new creation a level of authority in the spirit realm that is above ever created thing somehow another you missed that let me go it's over it again just as Adam was given dominion over every living creature in either in this new creation you are also given dominion over everything created well I'm trying to tell you you are the highest order in this creation and there's nothing of the old creation that is higher than you are not a devil not a sickness not a problem not a circumstance nothing it's greater than where you're sitting for your enthroned on this round and your reign from the spirit realm you're not just of this flesh but you're bringing the stress under obedience to the Word of God and sickness comes and we bring it to obedience a man in sin comes and we bring it to opinion that temptation come and we bring it to obedience because we are a people of Dominion we are sin has no power over sickness has no power over us [Applause] the Bible said you are seated there you look at the tints of the birds this is not something that will happen in the future this is not something will happen in the Millenium this does not say we will be seated it says we're already seated this is something that has already happened and then we are all the new creation and we've already been given authority that is far above every enemy for above all principality and power and might and Dominion and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that wage which is to come we have been given Dominion it comes with the new creation to Adam he would say you're the highest order of creation you're my son I give you Dominion to you he says you're the highest order of my new creation and I give you Dominion hallelujah we have an absolute unconditional authority over all demons we are in a position that is far above them we are though even the most powerful and highest rankin we are above I mean NEVER powerful and highest-ranking forces of evil we're above every one of them and this this Bible said explicitly says principalities and powers and never name that is named and he had put all things under his feet and given him to be head over the church which is his body the fullness of him who fills all in all so all things are under the feet of Jesus Jesus is a head of the church the church is his body the feet are part of the body and all things are under his feet so all things are under his body so all things are under the church so no wonder he said I give you power to tread on scorpions and serpents and over all the power of the enemy you and the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet hallelujah the Bible you need to believe this because it's the Bible and it's the truth it's truth whether you realize it or not whether you believe it or not I mind if you choose to believe it then you can you will be enjoying the benefits of it brother Branham tells us we're layer living below our privileges and I'm trying to tell you what are your seating what the new birth has done for you it has placed you in a position of authority it is a free gift that comes from being born again your authority comes with your birthright a man forever born again child of God sits with him in power and authority I don't care if you were born again with him yesterday all right happens today the moment you are born again you sit with him in authority and power over sin over all the works of the devil I'm explaining to you that right now you are more than a conqueror hallelujah I'm telling you right now you're not going to be conquered you were sent here to talk I am an authority over the devil and demons is not something we're working toward it'll not something that's limited for profits or preachers a man it's not a goal or a target that we're trying to reach it is true right this very minute it is already so hi man we don't have to work for it we don't have to pray it down I mean it was given us too as a gift and God gave it to us because of his great love he had for us a man not because of the hard-working holy living hallelujah putting your faith in Jesus there's several things happen one thing you are declared righteous did you hear me you are declared righteous by man you you are your diplay righteous and holy by God our Father in Romans 5:1 therefore having been justified or declared righteous by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says the righteous one shall live by faith they have a faith sense they have the ability to believe every born-again child of God he is a believer he believes that the days of miracles are never past he believes that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he believes whatever God says in his word he believes it hey man so you see he who he is give us the sense of faith what is that sense it's that super sense is God the faith of God in you the part of God that comes into you that gives you the super sense hallelujah you are you've got a super sense because you are others super race of supernatural people is people who does things supernaturally beyond the natural man now we are just as righteous as Jesus hello everybody we are just his righteous as Jesus but Jesus never sent neither did you in this new creation hallelujah a man the sea cannot sin it abides in him a man you you're talking about this which is still of the first creation but that which is of the new creation it don't doubt it don't fear a man it don't get confused it believes it's a believer hallelujah are you with me now you see you see Jesus this is what G's made Jesus fearless he knew he was righteous man he knew Satan had no claim on him the prince of this world has come and he had no claim on me a man so does he had no power over him he only can have power over those he has a claim over and he doesn't have a claim on you because you've been born again you're a child of God he can't claim you as yours as his child you were his child by your first birth but you're not a child anymore you are new creation in Christ you are born again believer and you are righteous as Jesus was righteous and holy as Jesus was holy God this might have me a runaway Amen but I'm talking about who you are because when the prat realizes her position the rapture will come wouldn't you realize the devil has no claim on me he has no right to me he has no right to my mind he has no right to my body he has no right to my soul I don't belong to him I not a slave to sin I'm not a slave to disease I'm not a slave to sickness I am NOT a slave did you hear me I am NOT a slave I don't belong to the devil I've been the original evolved JVM but because I was sold in the sin I wasn't intended to be that way but I was sold in the sentient but Jesus came and redeem me and it ain't my right and I am free son I've made free is free indeed hallelujah I declare you free from sin free from sickness today are you free from the power of ever demon spirit I can stand as fearlessly in the presence of Satan as Jesus did [Applause] hallelujah and I can use my family name to kick him out [Applause] because I have been given via power of attorney to use his name because he named me so I'm his child we can stand as fearlessly in the presence of Satan as Jesus stood fearlessly in the presence of Satan you see sin makes cowards of men but when we realize we're the possessors of righteousness the righteousness of God then we know we are God and we know we have God in us and we can spend fearlessly in the presence of Satan and command him and he has to obey righteousness is the ability of God taking possession in us we not only stand in the presence of Satan fearlessly but we stand before the throne of God fearlessly because we are conscious of the fact that we are his children and then we are born of the new creation created by God himself and Jesus has given us the power of attorney to use his name and act in his stead and he said in my name he shall cast out devils if we can cast him out we can do undo everything he's done we can cast him down if we can cast him down we can destroy his strongholds we can break in a bone in fearlessly that will mean his destruction in our victory how many's ready to have victory over the devil this is a day of victory a man I'm preaching about a bride who's and stick with the word who knows who they are who is that adopted sons and daughters of God who have been positioned and ordained and called for this hour to meet the devil in his own Eden and he can't make us do what he wants us to do hallelujah we could be right here in signal listen in the first Eden Adam could walk with God and there the devil had no power over him until he took sin nature then power came upon him Amen but friends when sin nature is gone and the Holy Ghost is there the devil has no more power over you you no longer have to do what he says you say you say you speak you say and it'll be done hey man now so therefore you are righteous do you believe it amen the Bible said that he became our sin that we might become his righteousness is that the Bible that you are the righteousness of God because he took your sin another thing you are spiritually born again and that was the new doctrine of the Old Testament Old Testament all heard the New Testament the Old Testament had but one birth are you with me that's why a child that was born an ass with a sinful occasion under adultery couldn't enter into the congregation Lord for didn't generation but that's not so in this generation that's not so under this covenant we got a greater blood than that and then we got a greater blood than that and then we've got a new birth now they only had one birth you had to be born in a certain lineage under a certain way in a certain type and that's way that you you know you had to be born to to be accepted in the kingdom but not in this one it's not a natural birth it's a spiritual birth and I don't care how naturally you were born amen this Holy Ghost come down breeze out all the coal that gives you the titles eternal life and nothing can separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus and it can't keep you out of a rapture it can't keep you keep you from any promise of God it is yours the cause of your fire it's your inheritance it belongs to you the new creation makes us the children of Almighty God God is our Father we are his children you were you were the Bible said in John 1:12 but as many as received him having to received him then they then he gave the right to become the children of God to those that believe on his name Amen so everyone that received him is born of him if you're born of him you I'm you have a right to all that heaven is you have a right to the inheritance you have the right to the throne you have a right to Dominion and then you were given citizenship with full rights into the kingdom of God Ephesians 2:19 says now therefore you are no longer strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and members of the household of God how great is that a man you have been given a citizenship with full rights into the kingdom of God because you're the family of God you're not only in the kingdom as a lower a lower person you are the royal family Amen you are the sons of God I mean you are the children of the Most High King you have been placed in a position our seat of authority that is higher than any created being for he says in Ephesians 2:6 he has raised us up together and made us a sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus a man that puts every one of us on shouting grounds right now are you with me Amen every one of us can be on shouting grounds because wherever he's sitting we're sitting whatever he rules over we're ruling over to a man his power is our power his name is our name his authority is our authority his kingdom is our kingdom [Applause] hallelujah let your kingdom come and your will be done in this earth as it is in heaven let me bring this body setting to what the Word of God says hey man the Bible said in Colossians 2:15 and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them so you see he spoiled principalities and powers and made a shoe or show of them openly triumphant and then you raise you up on the throne with him to rule and reign with him and then all this took place the instant you received his Holy Spirit amen so when the Holy Ghost came this Dominion came you with it it's something that is given to every child every son and daughter of God it is an act of his goodwill his grace his mercy a man and you did not work to earn it it came as a result of your faith in Jesus Christ is a free gift is an endowment on every child of God Alleluia oh brother Branham would say in God hiding himself in simplicity he taught he talked about the bud and he compared it with bleach and he said the blood of the Old Testament was little more like a paint that just just covered over the sin the sin was there but it was hidden behind the paint God couldn't see it because the blood the animal that atoned but he said not this blood this blood is not a paint this blood is a bleach and this blood it might when applied to sin it changes the chemistry a mile all the way back until you can't find it you can't see it it's not there no more I know there used to be something written on that wall but it's not there no more the bleach took care of it I know there was sin written all over that man but it ain't there no more the beach took care of it hallelujah man and it changed every molecule of it and it changed it by the benzene seems it down to the mediators all the way back until your sins land on the head of Satan so your accuser is packing your sins it's not your sins anymore it's their sins and you are free hallelujah I said you're free and it's not you going to hell for your sins it is going to hell to the lake of fire for your sins so you're the righteousness of God you see as he said what's the matter with the church had to explain about the blood and the blood of this covenant he soon there's something wrong my opinion we're not coming with the sincerity the right thing for that if God could do that by the blood of bulls and goats which he created created flies and fleas and and and and and all of those things had called up frogs from there by Moses and the blood of bulls and goats and man and that only covered Sam they made a perpetuation for the sinner but the sin was still there only covered over what can he do through the blood of his son that omits sin and God takes not a manufactured bleach but he created a blood that takes all sins away and mark 11:24 here's where it puts you in standing a man understands sitting on the throne is not just a sit down job to sit on the throne means you are ruling [Applause] somebody get it it means you are actively ruling you are commanding and expecting this to happen you are telling the demo where to go and he has to obey you are changing circumstances you are bringing everything septic to the Word of God hey man and so Deborah you stand he said it and he says it takes away all sin and mark 11:24 whatever you say now here you're on the throne where whatever you say to this mountain move and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said Oh where's the Pentecostal church at today and then you don't realize that confess truly confessed sin a missing and then if there's no admit to it it builds a bridge across the chasm that takes a man back in the presence of his creator and then makes him a son of God brother Branham would later say about this very thing and he says and it takes even the cows of the way don't ever even remember anything between you and him the chasms even gone where you were separated man and God was separated by sin egg man it takes a man back into the presence of his creator makes him a son of God a man he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also there you are verily I say to you if you see this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said nor that God is my God revealing himself in humility God taken a humble sinner and cleansing him by his blood and drop him that confess sin into that Clorox bleach of the blood of the Son of God and putting his own life into that man by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then he said we got the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost what's wrong with us when the type when Elijah dropped the robe for Elijah he got a double portion of it Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also and greater than this show you do for I go to my father what's wrong Church then he says the sky is full of genuine Pentecostal power that makes a man or woman a son and daughter of God it takes him back in the presence of God I know that people don't want that Pentecostal power but that's what's promised to the church you've got to get away from your own thoughts you got to get away let the mind oh is in Christ being you you have to stay there till ever sin of fear and Emerson up job has gone from your heart and if you're there and God doesn't take you and mitt your sins and Anna considering the presence of God there's something wrong with your experience your sins are confessed and in the blood of Jesus Christ you stand unadulterated a born-again son and daughter of God with the life of God in you to speak a word of creation let this mountain be moved and it will mind you now but you know it's possible it is possible for sons of God daughters of God born by the Spirit of God to have a position of authority and not know how to use it brother Brennan said and God of this evil ages that when the whole word of God into our word of God him complete was headed up in the human body called Jesus Christ and their God made me pay for my sins in him there then he rose me up raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil somebody say ever devil oh if you can only believe what God is given but if you're not seen in the air you don't have it and if you are seated there don't believe in afraid to move it you to move it you'll or to move you'll never use it but if you're seated there you will use it for you are deigned to do what you are to do how many believes in an ordained people a mass now let me just let me just share with you another quotation and we'll move on he says in question answers on the Hebrews all powers and heaven and earth is given on my hand going I'll be with you whatever you bind on earth I'll buy I'll bind in heaven what you loose on earth i loosed in heaven he's quoting Jesus oh if the great Holy Church only realize its power to do these things but there's so much doubt and fear and trembling and wonder if it will could it happen and as long as that exists the church can never stand upright and when ever talk of fear is vanished and the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone and that church has the power see what they have everything that heaven owns behind them they are ambassadors of the throne and absolutely an ambassador of the throne has the authority and everything Christ ohms belongs to that ambassador he said go into all the world you're my witness is that the Holy Ghost has come on you what is a witness it is the powers of heaven that's right in your hands he said all why do we sit and the church is barren and we set dormant is because we don't recognize these things hallelujah but I'm telling you friends there's a church that it's no longer barren she's under expectation I'm under expectation this morning I'm under expectation for God to come among us weep by His Holy Spirit drive out every demon power heal the sick cast out devils in his name and save the Lost that's the kind of God that I serve and I am announcing to the devil this morning a man that we are sitting on the place of authority and we know who we are there has been and given to a people in this last day you are not justified let's go back and look at Ephesians 1:15 hope you're not tired I got a ways to go we're canceling wins tonight so I'll bar sometimes from that if I mean it say that's brother Timothy's time he's not gonna be here coz we're dismissing Ephesians 1 15 therefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord and your love for all the Saints do not cease to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers I'd like to hear Paul pray hears his prayer that the Lord that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being lighten that you may know what is a hope of his calling what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe according to the working of his mighty power so know Paul's prayer I want you notice he is not praying God parappa your power or give the people more authority he is praying that the people their eyes would come open and the spirits will understand and be enlightened that they can realize what they already have a man we don't need to pray for no more faith Amen or more power or more authority that's actually praying unbelief I mean you don't believe what God gave you what the Bible says you have if we want to pray about this then we need to go to praying that God would help us to see what he's already given us and learn how to use the authority he's provided somebody with me now a man Colossians 1 and 12 given thanks unto the father which made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints of light listen he is saying giving thanks to the Father who had given us the ability to enjoy our share of the inheritance of the Saints in light he is one that God's wanting to give you the ability to see who you are the devil's lied to you hey man he's told you over and over you're worthless you're no good you don't have no faith you are weak I know why you give him credence because he'd never been known to tell the truth hey man I want you to look at the next verse what is that he had delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son you are now sitting in a kingdom on a throne because in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin and that's why we sit there because we're not we don't belong to the devil anymore and we have been translated we have been transferred we have been we have been structured up into the kingdom of his dear son you're in the kingdom there's another king back and he not just King you sit by and you rule with him hey man he has delivered you from the authority of darkness he has created you in Christ Jesus in your soul the nature of your soul has been your soul rather which is the nature of your spirit there has been an overshadowing of the Holy Ghost and when it does another son is born hallelujah now think about this now by the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost a sinless boy and on to us a child is born unto us a son was given and his name should be called wonderful counselor Prince of Peace mighty God and this same one comes along to birth other sons that you can reign with the same Dominion as he reigns with listen again the peasants 210th we are his workmanship we are created in Christ Jesus to good works which God hath ordained before that we should walk in them God ordained me to walk in good works hallelujah Ephesians 4:22 we've read it that put off the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts from me renewed in the spirit of your mind that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness hey man we put off the old man with his deeds perfect faith brother Branham says so when a man lives my faith and walks by faith I mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there you are getting into material see you're getting a rupturing condition now and now this is the mystery of the new creation we have come into bride material rapturing condition by the infusion of his life and his faith into us by the new birth I mean that's how we that's how we have perfect faith Amen it's attributed the gift of God the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost always has perfect faith it perfectly believes the word man we by being born of the Spirit are infused with his life and so therefore infused with his faith I want to ask you if you're born again what faith do you have well I've got weak faith not if you're born again I've got an align so faith not if you're born again I got just human trait not if you're born again let me read you what kind of fates you have Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with Christ can somebody say man a man nevertheless I live I mean he's living a man yet not i but Christ lives in me thereby here with me amen and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I am living in the flesh the light for the Son of God and I have his faith dominating faith created paid that says the word is true this feels every child God with his righteousness it gives him direct access to the throne room to ask anything in his name a man and by the throne-room authority to demand any demon any sickness any disease to lead a man and his word is back all heaven is behind the word but Burt said the new creation the believer is given dominion over every spirit every sin every disease just as Adam did before the fall you know you got to take a look you got to take advantage of your legal rights before the throne you have the very same spirit that Jesus had you have the Holy Spirit as did the Apostles a man you possess his faith it is a faith that Jesus had but yet now it is your faith you have a right to it it belongs to you it's the faith of Christ you have eternal life you have the same righteousness that he had you have its value are his very own life in human dippel's and you should take advantage of your legal rights before the throne because you have the the same legal standing before God that Paul or any of the other apostles had a man God has made me greater than all of my enemies hallelujah look at your neighbor and tell'em God has made me greater than all of my enemies amen as Joshua had elders to put their feet on the neck of the Canaanite Kings remember them man he come against them that they came against somebody took the five kings throw them in the cave and said now we're going to fight all your defeat all your enemies but boys were coming back to deal with you a little and when the battle was over somebody helped me he pulled out all of those five kings of the game of knights and he said to tell you what I want you to do boys I want every one of the elders of Israel to take and put their foot on the neck of all of these kings and men because if you got your feet on the neck of the Kings you've got your feet on everything beneath them hallelujah amen so therefore and then if he set up a tread on serpents and scorpions and the God of peace will bruise Satan under my feet Satan did you hear me Satan the biggest the biggest king of them all Satan under my feet hallelujah God then has put my foot on the neck of the devil if I got my foot on the neck of the devil everything beneath him is under my feet every one of his sicknesses everyone is diseases every one of his I'm somebody every thing that devil is is represented in Lucifer and God has put Satan under your feet hallelujah I cannot be put to shame my sins are gone my weaknesses are routed the devil is on the run my past is forgiven in fact in this new creation I have no sinful past and no sin can be attributed to me to the life that I now live in Christ I cannot be put her shame and when the strength of God is mine I am here to put into action hallelujah faith in action becomes a verb and that Burgas will be I am a believer that's a noun but I believe that's a verb it's an action word I'm a time to use the word as a sword in my tongue somebody help me now wait a minute you know movie ho as men hold swords in her hands when you read the Bible he holds his sword this King holds a sword in his mouth and the old creation you held swords with a with a hand and this creation you hold a sword in your mouth yes and it is the Word of God and it is powerful and quicker than any two-edged sword and it'll cut and it'll devour and it'll a sudden die hey man hey it'll go through any enemy are you with me amen so therefore we've got to keep the sword in action using the Word of God is a sword in your tongue you got to keep confessing keep confessing a man keep confessing where you're positioned because your sense knowledge your confession into your sense knowledge to see taste smell fill in here your your cut your having to confess what God says you are not what your site is saying you are what site says how big the devil is what so what your ears have been told about how awful this devil is I remembered you saw confessing who you are you can keep confessing who he is you can keep confessing the power of his name that we overcome how do we do it we defeat the enemy and we gain victory through the blood of the Lamb and by the witness are the word of our testimony is that right we speak the word of our testimony by the mouth of two or three witnesses and the word is established God witnesses own word Jesus blood justifies we are healed wife testifies that his atonement is sufficient and complete and our mouth witnesses the same thing that's how you establish separate Word of God Jesus said it I believe it and I confess it hallelujah that there pro man is sufficient it is complete and our mouth witnesses the same this establishes the lordship of Christ amen that he is Lord over every situation hey I want to say to you today lay me lord over every situation in your life declare him to be lord over that cancer a man over that sickness over that heart disease a man going and then realize that that that the name of Jesus every knee has to bow and every tongue has to confess that he is the ruler Amen Satan can't stay any longer and my perfect love for Christ and his word is casting out fear man ah you remember what sister Karen back there laid with a significant brain bleed there were creative words came out of my mouth and man it happened when I said we will not fear we are believers and that's what we mark do we do we are believers and believers believe a man and when I spoke those words confessing who we were and who God is man the Lord spoke it said she'll be in I see room tonight to my nights you be in her in a in a private room and the next night should be in her own bed what happened the spirit creative works with spoke and things begin to happen and later she begin to worship God hey man and as she began to worship God acted now listen it was felt but she's got act on it and then the word is being preached but you got act on it listen we can create the atmosphere for faith for a sinner to be saved we can create it by preaching the word we can tell you the word it's true that he comes to save you but you got act on it oh man they're not just coming down to the altar either it's you believing that's me he's my Savior he's my Redeemer and he's given the Holy Ghost to me cause he said he wants to give it to me not because I'm looking for a feeling or sensation but because he said it hey man I'm taking him at his word he made the problem and I believe it hey mouth but that day created words the spoken things begin to happen she began to worship the Lord and acting upon it and when she did creative words created cells in her eyes and behind I came back open the new human and she can see again we take her back to to the University Hospital and they would do another unknown another cat scan not a cat scan but an MRI and they would look and they say there is nothing there we ain't seen nothing there it was going never happened man she goes to the eye doctor not doctor looks at the MRIs that was

lenses you are healed you are a miracle girl a man Wow she acted on the word a man the same is true of sister Lana a man one day she had a black lung full of cancer the next day not a trace I want you to know why the creative Word of God created new sales and drove out the back hallelujah her enemy was declared dead it was not a flesh and blood affair it was the Lord's battle and he came through with the victory Amen hallelujah what was it it was faith in action hey man she heard she she received a word of promise one day I was sitting about a month before and I was praying and the Lord gave me a scripture to send to her and it was witnessed there my sister Mary Katherine who sins the same Scripture and there that this is not your battle this is the Lord's battle so she said Lord if it's going to be your battle and you're gonna have to do something miraculous a man you're gonna have to do something very miraculous if it's your battle and man you're gonna have to do something she began to expect something came to the service sitting right back there in the mezzanine away from everybody because of the chemo she was taken you remember a man she heard the word priest a man that we were in Bible days with the Bible faith with the Bible God and God was doing extreme things hallelujah and there as she heard the word there sitting in her seat as we begin to sing leaning on the everlasting she put faith in action she ran around the building and around the building and rejoicing because faith was being put into action we didn't see a healing we didn't see something move senses didn't declare it feelings may not have declared it but God's Word is already spoken and said your enemy is dead and she goes back to the hospital for another scab and declared cancer-free hallelujah stand up sister Lana and then she just have another stand the other day and then still cancer-free Wow faith was put into action set time he believed the word this is Bible days this was a

was a woman's glory and God had given that to women - as a Glorian and now the Bible said they were not to cut it cuz it was to show that the headship of Christ this is Bible this is not made except this first Corinthians 11 a man and so so therefore as I was preaching that I looked out there and I saw a little bald-headed girl who the devil had robbed of all her hair man there was no hair growing I mean you in that disease your eyelashes fall off the hair on your arms your legs everything falls off your hair falls I every bit of your hair follicles are destroyed by an evil demo they call it alopecia but it's a demon and it attacked one of our children who is to show for God's glory oh man I called her down to the altar that day in the name of the Lord but it wasn't always the
