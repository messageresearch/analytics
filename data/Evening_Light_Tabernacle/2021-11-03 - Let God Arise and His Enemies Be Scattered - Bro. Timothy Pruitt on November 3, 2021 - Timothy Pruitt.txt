to just follow your unction lord your leadership lord just help us you know the battles we've been in the things lord the devil's tried to do but lord we know that you're more than able to face any situation you're the conqueror of conquerors the god of god and the lord of lords well there's nothing too hard for you father we commit this time into your hands lord bless each and every heart we pray in jesus name amen amen let's turn to psalms 68 and verse 1. [Music] i went to bed last night praying for brother ron just just was really on my heart just all evening pretty much thinking about him and and looking for god to move on his behalf and his situation you know i went to a fellow sleep praying for him and early this morning i was dreaming about him and uh don't really remember anything particular about the dream but uh these words woke me up as if someone spoke to me let god arise and let his enemies be scattered amen let god arise and let his enemies be scattered let them also that hate him fleef before him as smoke is driven away so drive them away as the wax melted before the fire so let the wicked perish at the presence of god but let the righteous be glad let them rejoice before god yea let them exceedingly rejoice sing unto god sing praises to his name extolled unto him that writeth upon the heavens by his name jah or jehovah and rejoice before him amen we let you be seated but these uh these words would ring out in my ears as if somebody was in the room speaking them to me and it would wake me up let god arise and his enemies be scattered to arise is to become powerful in that moment or in that situation to come on the scene scattered means to break or to shatter to dash to pieces and that's what we need today is our god to come on the scene and on our behalf and to become powerful on our behalf to arise amen to scatter the enemies and we know that there is no enemy that can stand before him as the scripture would say is as the smoke their enemy would stand before him as smoke driven away by the wind or as wax would melt before fire so there's nothing that can stand before god there's no sickness there's no sin there's no enemy of any kind there's no demon of any kind there's no satan himself cannot stand before the i am amen and so we see that he he has to come and to become powerful on our behalf in the hour that we're living in that's what it means for god to arise we can go through the scriptures and we can see god arising in the past we can see god moving in the past we can see all the testimonies and things that we can bring up and some that we will but amen we don't really need just the god of the past amen we don't need a god who healed cancer even four or five years ago we need a god who heals cancer today and i'm here to say he's still that same kind of god it doesn't matter what critics may say it doesn't matter what doctor's reports may say it doesn't matter what anybody else has to say god is still god amen when god moves he moves amen amen and so we're looking for him to arise we're looking for him to show himself powerful in the day that we are living them you know it was in jairus house where the doctors had come to their last moments and they had tried all that they had could do and they failed they they had given over the little girl amen to death and and death had come and taken her and had taken his bitter toll and taken the only child of that home away from that family and there she laid stretched out on the couch on the on the couch dead and her broken-hearted daddy a little preacher you know and he had to be he was forsaken by all of his friends and and forsaken by all of his church but he remembered there was a god of history he remembered that there was a god who had raised the dead before he he had read the scripture where god had went to the shunamite woman's house and god had raised that little boy who had died so he said if i could find that god and he's still the same god the same god that raised that boy will raise my girl amen amen and we know the scripture says seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you and it shall be and ask and it shall be given to you so if you want a god like that start seeking a god like that if you want a god like that start knocking on the doors for a god like that if you want a god to come on your on the behalf of your family or your situation ask and you'll find a god like that he's still the same god amen he said when this god dwelling in a body called jesus the son of god when he was called on the scene therefore jairus called up out of history a god who could raise the dead in the old testament was now standing in flesh in the new amen and he amen and this dead baby through a prophet that that god could come and raise him up to life again and that baby laying on the bed stretched out in little jairus house him knowing that the shunamite woman got her baby back he said that god of history if he could ever be called into action he's the same god today and searching through the land he heard of a man who who had they claimed to have the power and this was jesus called of nazareth whom they all hated but he had called him on the scene for he was the closest representative he could find of a living god and when he was called on the scene a historical god was called up and when he was caught up to the present he acted the same way he did in the past when he spoke to elijah over a dead baby he said let me say this today my brother or sister in this present day when crisis is on at hand when cancer is eating the world up when diseases of all kinds if that same historical god who cleansed the leopard that same god who healed the sick that same god who raised the dead is the same god today he's waiting anxiously for his people to call him on the scene of action i believe this morning it woke me up to say amen i believe god is wanting his people to start calling on him we have a need we have needs in the body we have sicknesses around us we have one of our generals that's been struck down by this cancer amen it's time that we open our mouth and say let the god of history come forth to the present let the same one that healed atlanta buzz go to virginia grotto virginia and heal that man let the same god come on the scene [Applause] hallelujah he's waiting anxiously for his people to call him on the scene amen there's got to be something in your heart that'll stir you to say i gotta find that one who he'll cancer before i gotta find that one who saved the lost one before i gotta find that one who healed this or healed that who delivered this one i gotta find that same jesus for my need amen and you'll find when you find him you'll find a god who's ready to go to battle for you oh hallelujah amen when god fights for his people the enemy is as helpless before them as smoke is before wind come on now amen when god stands up when god arises for his people the enemy no matter what name it is is as helpless as smoke is before wind smoke cannot stand before wind or as helpless as a wax is before fire nothing can stop him as he rises to do battle nothing can stand before him when he decides it's time to rise up oh hallelujah i believe we're at the moment of the greatest rising of god out of history listen i'm looking for the god who has the power of resurrection amen i believe there's a people that's calling for their power and say i want that power in my life the bible says when you see him begin to move he said rejoice because he's here to prove his word as he did in other days hallelujah we can read in mark chapter 4 and verse 35 as these thoughts begin to go through my mind early in the morning i thought about this this particular occasion that happened in scripture so the same day when the evening was come he said unto them let us pass over unto the other side now notice he left a lot of details out in that statement but god is not always concerned in all the details because in the details is the enemy and the details of the trials and the details is the situations you're going to face he's just saying let's go on over to the other side in other words no matter what you're going to face i've got the answer for it amen listen jesus knew the winds and waves were coming amen he knew because he knew who was on the other side it was a little maniac over there amen that was crawl calling out for help and that call amen from that man who was caught in that place amen brother branham said every once in a while who would come to himself and he would say lord have mercy on me and that call would go across the sea and reach a god that was now not just a god of history but a god of the presence and that call would cause him to leave and to go to the other side now he wasn't worried about the winds and the waves and the things that were going to go on in between he just knew i had a place i have a place to be and i'm going to be there come on somebody i have a place to be and i'm going to be there i have a marriage supper of the lamb to go to and i'm going to be there it doesn't matter about the winds and the waves and the things that's going on around us what matters he's with us amen this scripture actually let god arise and his enemies be scattered would actually be what moses would even speak there when the when the ark would begin to move when the cloud would begin to move and when that cloud began to move they knew it was time to go and they and they knew that it was you couldn't wait a mile just go the next day you wait till the next day to pack up you'll be left amen they knew when that clout began to move they began to put everything together the tent was folded up things when you saw that happening you started putting your tent up started packing your mules you started putting it all together because you saw that cloud moving and when that ark was put on those priests amen on the priest's shoulders moses would scream out let god arise and his enemies be scattered oh hallelujah amen that's exactly what takes place amen when the priest puts the word on his shoulders and it goes out to preach the word of god amen there's a voice crying out let god arise and an enemy be scattered that's why when the word goes forth cancer can fall off sugar diabetes can fall off sin can fall off because why the word is being packed on the shoulder of the priest when you saw the word move you moved that's where people's getting their problems are they they're not moving with the word they're wanting to camp out on their own ideas and their own thoughts and their own things and they find themselves sometimes in a real predicament could you imagine you thought well today i don't feel like packing up my tent you're out in the desert there and you saw the priests you saw the clouds start moving priest starts running around they start grabbing their stuff start putting it together packing the tent up putting in this place everything in this florida and all of a sudden the ark's on the shoulder of the levites and it's going out to following this cloud you know not today now i'm going to stay here and all of a sudden you're watching this as it goes away and you realize that you know the desert's a lot hotter now why because the cloud amen was sitting there keeping those harmful rays off of you amen you thought in the morning i'm going to get up and i'm going i'm going to go get my manners i didn't know you didn't realize the cloud was giving you all of that amen and you you thought well i'm going to go out there and i'm going to find me a rock to get some water out of you didn't realize the cloud was giving you all of that come on somebody remember when the word goes forth you move with the word [Applause] when the word speaks you go with the word why because there's water in there there's food in there there's protection in there there's mercy in there there's grace in there there's healing in there there's deliverance in there god's in there i'm going with the word hallelujah when i look and sickness is trying to press it i'm pressing into the word come on to the cloud hey man you can make fun of the cloud all you want to make fun of the cloud you realize we're really quick you know what there was some protection under there i miss now it's a little hotter than it used to be i ain't getting quite as much food as they used to get not getting much water as you nourishment and things that i used to get what's happened the clouds moved amen mercy so he says let's go over to the other side it was just as if as he did to there to the children of israel i'm going to take you out of a land i'm going to take you into a land let's go over to the other side i've already got a land prepared for you oh hallelujah so let's go on over to the other side hey man let's walk we might be over here in cancer over here and sugar diabetes over here in doubts over here in fear oh let's go on over to the other side because on the other side is full deliverance on the other side there's enough power that'll deliver a man possessed with thousands of demons [Applause] pass on over to the other side when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in his ship and there also were him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and waves beat into the ship so it's now full and he was in the honda part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awakened him and awakened him and said unto him master carest thou not that we perish and he arose he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm let god arise and the enemies be scattered let god arise and cancer have to bow down to him let god arise and depression has to fall away let god arise and peace be still the brandon said i can imagine how he felt he'd had a great day tired been speaking all that day teaching the parables he's exhausted mentally physically in every kind of way because his flesh was a man he got tired as a man he got sleepy as a man that's why it makes him such a great god because he knows what it's like to feel how we feel he knows what it's like to come out of a great amen meeting and how things are wonderful and go back home again amen and have issues and things arise and you don't feel all the hype and the things that went on and you feel so wore out and tired sometimes he knows all about it that's what makes him great he don't just tell you that he knows he knows what you know it's kind of like this and i say this very tenderly because every word it does it doesn't mean a lot but you know people want to give you their sympathy when you've lost a loved one but unless they really been through it they don't know how it feels they try to support they try to do all they can and that's wonderful and thankful for everyone but when somebody comes to you and they've suffered great loss and they've been down that same road they know what that's like to be walking in the shoes you're walking in and they know what it feels like they know the loneliness and the things you're going through and the myths and then and all the problems and situations that arise that you the other folks don't haven't even thought about they've never been there but listen this is god he knows what it's like he's been there he's been through depression he's been through anxiety come on somebody i gotta make you shout when you know your god's been there he's been through sicknesses he's been through strives he's been through arguments he's been through church troubles [Applause] he's been through it all here he is laying in a boat had a great day of healing the sick and teaching his physical strength remember he was just a man in flesh but in spirit he was god all that god had dwelt in that body therefore his body was human it was subject to temptations subject to sicknesses just the same as ours so he knew what it's like to have a headache he knew what it was like for your neck to ache he knew what it was like to have back problems he knew what all these things were like he was a human a man but then on the spirit he was god i and my father are one my father dwelleth in me when john baptized them on the river jordan we see god descended from heaven like a dove and the voice said this is my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell in i'm pleased to dwell in so god dwelt in christ and in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily god expressing himself through jesus jesus was the very vindication of god god being a man though jesus being a man physically was tired and weary virtue was gone he said well how could it be god and be a man there's the mystery man dwelling in god dwelling in man same as today the mystery of christ revealed but you see we find him back there resting knowing there was another day ahead of him going to meet this maniac been cutting himself and living out among the devils brothers i believe he knew all about it the father had sent him over there to take care of it but now he's tired and weary and it goes back and it takes his opportunity for a little rest oh crossing the seas head on a pillow don't look much like god resting there the disciples said you know well our day's journey is about over i work for him now we can take up our regular tests let's just start pulling the boat let's just put our hands to the oars and start pulling the boat brother adam said it's just about like a bunch of disciples today after revival is over you know you might as well just settle in and you know we're just gleaning from it and and you know each man back to his own church and take up his own job again just pulling at the boat amen we find that's what they did while jesus was taking his rest and they began to talk about the things they had saw and how great he was and how wonderful the miracles and signs and things had had taken place i mean they saw some incredible things they saw blind eyes be brought back to sight again they saw deaf ears uh here again they they saw the dumb speak they saw the epilepsy but boy that was being throwed in the fire be delivered they saw some great things surely this must be the messiah has to be they begin to talk to others that wasn't even in their group and they find that others thought well surely there's no man could do this for god it it has to be and then they'd find others and say well he's a beelzebub he's a fortune teller he's nobody he's a liar he makes up stories he exaggerates the truth they saw him cleanse the leper they had saw him raise the dead they saw him feed five thousand with five loaves and two fishes i read what brother branham talked about he said there was somebody that tried to say well you don't know how they used to make loaves back then it was a big load he said well i i'm here to tell you a boy brought him in his lunch a little boy brought him in his lunch and you're trying to tell me that these was five loaves big enough to feed 5 000 some lunch box amen could you imagine that little boy at school here comes john in his lunch box again feed 5 000. no it's five little loaves of bread and two little fish and they saw the very creator of god tear it off put it in a basket and there's another piece back there again not raw not alive but dead and cooked and seasoned he pulled it off and there's another piece again pull it off and then enough to feed 5 000 plus and have 12 baskets left over that's a big lunch box amen and here they were they saw all these things they saw him fall in the service and and hit a little woman sitting right up there and her running around the church and the next day she goes and there's no cancer anymore they had saw with their own eyes a little bald-headed girl coming to a prayer line with some little pens and say i'm gonna wear these and today as they got on the boat she got full wasted waist-length hair no doubt got a closet full of bobby pins and brits i mean i would god did that for me and i was a girl i'd have all kinds of them amen they had saw it with their own eyes they saw a little boy who couldn't walk march around the house and give praise to god they saw a god who'd come on the scene and heal brain please they saw god do miraculous things and here they are just rowing the boat it's wednesday night again i got to go row the boat it's my i got to get my position to roll the boat and it heard though it hurt well you know that wasn't alopecia that was that had to be something else there you make out whatever excuse you were going to call it you can call it whatever you want to call it all i know is once my girl was bald-headed and now she got a full head of hair and the doctor said there wasn't nothing he could do about it so call it what you want to critic i call it god amen they can make up all kinds of things they can deny all they want to deny you'll find anybody to say anything haven't it i mean good lands just you put something out somewhere you know you you can't never get a hundred people to degree it can't only get ten degree anymore they've seen all these things take place and they begin to think about all the negative things around him and think about that and he said brother adam said but you know there was this young john there on the boat his heart was maybe not so scarred with so much theology no doubt as he screamed out he said think of it right here in the ship is the one who did all of that [Music] think about it right here in this service is the one who healed cancer is the one who brought hair back is the one oh hallelujah think about who's here don't let the waves and the wind distract you from who's here he hasn't left the ship right here in the ship is the one that had been identified as jehovah jehovah's word to be the messiah and whom he's well pleased he's writing what a secured feeling i have tonight he said oh if we tonight could only catch that vision he caught that's a very jehovah that made the heavens and you got your joy shoes on the very jehovah that made the heavens and the earth is right in this little vessel of ours while we're sailing through life's solemn may for the holy ghost is jehovah in spirit form and he is with us even in us [Applause] oh hallelujah then god all that god was important to christ and all that christ was he poured in this church and invited it on the day of pentecost that pillar of fire came down and busted itself up the shekinah glory and put it into different ones tons of fires was seen upon each of one of them the holy spirit identifying himself again in human beings talk about amazing grace what a security that is to know that if you have the holy ghost he's in your ship oh come on now do we got anybody now with the holy ghost in here tonight what a security it is to know if you have the holy ghost he's in your ship and not only is he in your ship he's never going to get out of your ship there's not a wave high enough there's not a storm too grey that's going to make him abandon the ship there's not a cancer bad enough there's not a there's not a sickness hard enough there's not a battle too hard or too many devils that's going to make him jump off the ship no he has put himself there and he's tied himself to it oh my the one who can perform any miracle can do anything is in our little boat oh my same as he was then so is he is now what a feeling of security while sailing through troubled waters what a feeling it is to know just because brother ron has cancer doesn't mean jesus left the boat no he promised he wouldn't matter of fact he promised him he said if you'll trust me i'll use you like never and we can all say he has i'll tell you what if you're ever having a bad day just go tune into one of his sermons that'll cause you to pick yourself up by the bootstraps and kick yourself in the hind end and get going because you're not gonna let somebody with stage four cancer outpraise you why would we with a whale body let somebody like that out praise us that's what he said i'm using his own words amen there ought to be something within you when you see a man in that condition say if he can do that in his condition what can i do in my condition what can i do with a full body with a full healthy lungs and a healthy body ain't battling blood sugar and this and the other and blood clots and he's still out there saying god's able he's here don't give up keep pressing the battle how dare us stand on the backside and say i give up i walk i'm not giving up if god be for us who can be against us he's still on the ship i'm going to tell you right now he's proved it more to me that he's on the ship in these last few months i've lived in at any time in my life well what about when your mother was healed and we rejoiced about it didn't that yeah that proved but when i can go through storms and i know he's still there and he's moving even when i can't see him working he's working even when i can't feel him he's still working these disciples discussing what they had saw and all sudden trouble rose he said that's satan he ain't going to let you rest very long maybe you find yourself resting tonight don't worry it's not going to last very long unless you're on the wrong side maybe but if you on the side of the i am he's not going to let you rest very long somebody said it like this said you're either in a tr in a trial right now or you're just coming out of one or you're about to go in another but then trouble arose the ship began to rock the sails blew off the orange broke water filled up the boat trouble is at hand and it happened so suddenly all hopes are from survival was gone doctor said there's no way you're gonna make it though they had seen them do all those things still trouble stroke struck and he said many times when that happens that's when you forget what he's done and who he is and he's in your ship they had just been talking about him they had just been expressing their love and appreciation and how and all of a sudden we're grounded we're dying have you looked at fox news covert is killing everybody we're never going to win anymore they're it's all rigged well you know it's it's rigged all right we're going to win we're getting out of here that's the rig i'm worried about i ain't worried about the rigging of republicans versus democrats all i know is i've read the book of the back of the book and it's already been written i'm going to be seen over there i'm going to be there amen dressed in white praising the lamb of god and worshipping him with all my heart singing a song unto him that the angels cannot sing he said he said it's about the attitude of people we come to church shout praise god and our brothers and so forth speak the word we can hear the promises we praise god for what he's done listen the testimonies of one saying i once was blind but now i see doctor gave me up for cancer two weeks or two days or something like that there's one now there's no not even one speck of cancer it's been a long time ago they can't find it no more i i lay bound up in a wheelchair paralyzed i walk as good we hear all those testimonies but let it strike our little house and we forget about all that glory we've been enjoying and all those great things because it's us now but those things happen for a purpose they happen to try you trouble that we can't remedy it seems like the doctors can't remedy it there's nothing that it tries to pull ourselves away it breaks our oars it fills our ships up satan was determined to destroy them and he's all sort of time don't think he's not he is determined to try to destroy you every time he gets a chance here he comes as a prophet of god's word every time he gets a chance here he comes oh you go to the doctor and he'll say there's nothing you can do it's advanced you haven't got nothing for a nervous breakdown no we don't have nothing for mental trouble no arthritis no leukemia no but when you're in the middle of trouble he says this is the time to look back and say hasn't he healed leukemia before hasn't he healed cancer before hasn't he saved before hasn't he kept his word before amen don't get in trouble and forget what he's done and who he is and where he is when trouble comes in you can't find a remedy that's when fear sets in that's what even covert was really about we felt like you know people they put out there there's no remedy they're trying to fight this and find this and they find this would work for a little did that and fear was moving in fear fear fear fear fear fear fear comes with this thing oh i know some people try to hide from it still do i'm just going to be straight up honest apparently the covey does not go to walmart but it goes to church amen they're hiding from it well i can't be in a big gathering we'll stay out of walmart stay out of the ball games amen but what is it fear ain't it funny fear tries to keep you from the very place you can receive the most help amen but he's in the ship who is this is him in the beginning was the word and the word was god and the word was with god and the word is the same yesterday today and forever it still just takes this this is the remedy if the doctors can't find the remedy this is the remedy hello somebody even if the doctors have done all they can do this is the remedy amen no matter what situation it's the listen it's a cure for every cancer can i wave it up they say i ain't got a cure this is still the cure amen it's the core for every ailment it's a cure for every disease it's secure for every sin it's a cure for every devil it's a cure for every torment and spirit it's secure for every spirit of depression it's secure for everything the devil could ever throw and a believer you already have the answer we heard it sunday we have the devil's answer oh my god let me read well let me just wave this in the face of cancer right now he's the lord god that heals all diseases by his stripes ron spencer is healed let god arise and the enemies be scattered hallelujah god is looking for a people that'll call him up out of history and say god we need you today is there such a people in the building tonight and say i need that guard tonight i need him out of history i need him over here on my page i need him in my book i need him in my life i need that same yesterday today and forever for timothy pruitt [Music] oh hallelujah hey if you need him if i was you right now i'd start calling him. amen it don't it don't matter what time the service is when you need jesus it's time you call him if you wanted to move on your behalf i wouldn't wait to another service i wouldn't wait to a special time in the service and when i need jesus i'd start calling on jesus amen you think blind bartimaeus would have got his visitation if it had just sit there and waited for a better day waited for a better service waited for a better time no but he heard a sound coming and he said who is that they said that's jesus of nazareth he said the same jesus that gladly gave my eyes to this blind over here yes the same one that healed the leopard yes the same one that raised the dead yes jesus jesus [Applause] oh let god rise bring it on down where's god at today he's not bobbing out in a little wooden boat somewhere he's in a fleshly boat he's in us brother brown will say it like this he said do you realize you're closer to him today than they was then i don't know how long that boat was brother andrew maybe maybe john was sitting about here to you from from jesus jesus back there laying asleep and you're closer to day than he was maybe maybe you happen to be right next to him maybe you got to get a seat right next to where he laid down and yet you're still closer to him than he was because he's not just with you he's in you he's not just with you he's in you he's not just in your car sitting on the seat somewhere he's in your car he's in your vessel he's in your life amen and sometimes his brother would say we've allowed him to go to sleep but he hadn't left the boat this is not a holy ghost that comes and goes and comes and goes and comes he said no you're sealed until the day of your redemption so until the day that this body is fully redeemed he's in this boat so let god arise hello let god arise where is he going to rise from over there sitting over there where is he going to rise from he's going to rise from hearts and lives of men and women filled with the holy ghost to the devil you come far enough i'm done dealing with you devil you've come far enough you've taken enough health you've caused enough problems you caused enough strife you've caused enough peace be still hey there's the power of resurrection in voices of men and women today it's the same power said lazarus come forth and it happened he said that same spirit is on the inside of you he said that's deity on the inside of you and when you speak it's the same as deity speaking when you speak his word his will time we quit speaking our doubts the frustrations and our worries this more brother timothy the ship's bobbing up and down he's still in the ship there's problems on every side is dark he's still in the ship there's situations all around us it feels like we're about to see he's stealing the ship amen disciples found themselves at the end could you imagine that little boat i've been out on lake clayburn and it got bad enough and scared me out on lake cleveland i've been out in the sound over there on the washington side with james lay i still ain't got over there i thought it was pretty cool bouncing up down on this little boat going across this sound we'd went across it wasn't so bad coming

unto you he's right here not by intellectual conception but he's here by spiritual revelation he is the same yesterday today and forever we worship the invisible god who has been made manifest among us hallelujah oh the pillar of fire is now settling upon you that cloud that followed that that led the children of israel that fire is even in the building tonight let us settle over us tonight to realize he's still here with us he ain't left us where he's went we went what he's moving we're moving what he's doing we're doing what he's saying we're saying oh hallelujah the same invisible god identified himself here tonight jeremiah one day faced a terrible time fear on every side tried to hold his mouth tried to keep himself silent he said i i wasn't going to speak it but his word was like fire shut up in my bones i wasn't going to halt it no more i wasn't going to say i couldn't i couldn't keep it back because it was burning on the inside of me and i was weary with forebearing and i couldn't stay where i was at no more and i heard of the defaming the fear of many i heard the reports of the others but the lord he is with me as a mighty terrible one you know what a mighty terrible one it's a dreaded champion oh hallelujah amen you know i was reading a story that day about andre the giant he was a wrestling guy but he was a huge fella but they say there's a gentle man one day he was in his plane of i think a hotel room or something or a lobby area with some people gathering around and some guys decided they want to pick a fight see if he was really what he would have thought he was what they what he thought he was you know as they put him out there on the wrestling scene anybody he was a giant man i don't know over seven foot tall who knows how many pounds big old giant fell ahead probably about that big and a fella i'd want to go decide i want to see if he's what he thinks he is they said he kept pushing at him and poking at him and making fun of him and calling him all kind of names and he just ignored him for a little while just ignored him for a little while but you could see it was starting to get on him and after a minute he had enough he grabbed a chair and he chased them boys out of the building so they went out there and they grabbed their vehicles they jumped in their vehicle is going to take off he grabbed that vehicle and he flipped it over on his side see one thing you don't want to mess with is a giant and one thing you don't want to mess with satan is this dreaded champion as we heard sunday morning sages be careful well hallelujah but the thing about it is the devil don't realize something he's looking for the man jesus he's looking for god he's looking for some grace but all of a sudden he comes up to a little teenager and he starts poking it starts making fun of him starts saying this and that about it and about that time that teenager turns around it's a devil i'll resist you in the name of the lord well hallelujah and the next thing you know satan's kingdom it's troubling over and over oh come on somebody i say cancer you've been poking long enough you poked and you tried it and you coke and your

armies of the living god [Music] whoa hallelujah satan you've come and you've poached and you prodded and you made his life miserable you caused the sugar to go this way and that way you've caused heart problems you've caused lung problems you caused every kind of thing but we come against you in the name of jesus christ and we hold the sword of the lord in front of us and we're going to cut back every devil of hell satan take your hands over god's property in the name of jesus christ for the glory of almighty god let god arise and his enemies be scattered oh yes lord he sent forth his
