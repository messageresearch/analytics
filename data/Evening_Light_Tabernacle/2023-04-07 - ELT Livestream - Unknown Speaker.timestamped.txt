[45:16] for sister Erica and myself there was a
[45:20] conversation that took place in a cave

[48:21] amen
[48:22] LIC in the building today amen we're so
[48:26] honored to be a part of her life and
[48:29] what she is is a miracle in progress and
[48:32] so
[48:33] amen amen
[48:36] I'd like to speak to you today on what
[48:38] will you
[48:39] be remembered for
[48:45] what will you be remembered for
[48:52] great books have a lot of parts
[48:56] they have introductions
[48:58] the chapters are lined up
[49:01] generally in the first chapter it's a
[49:03] it's a chapter of grabbing your
[49:05] attention
[49:06] so that you won't lay the 300 Page book
[49:08] down
[49:10] it grabs your attention in a way to
[49:12] where that you've realized that if I
[49:14] don't read this book I'm going to be
[49:15] missing a part in my life
[49:19] it brings great Intrigue to it
[49:21] then it begins to go into the body of
[49:24] work it's the it's the behind the scenes
[49:27] chaos
[49:28] brings the miracle together of life
[49:32] then as it begins to come to the winding
[49:34] down of it to leave you with great great
[49:37] feelings it begins to come toward the
[49:39] final chapters
[49:41] and as it comes to the final chapters it
[49:44] will bring conclusion to your life
[49:48] there's a lot of things that you will
[49:50] accomplish in your life
[49:52] but I'd like to just kind of give you a
[49:54] little little teaser
[49:56] without Jesus
[50:01] without Jesus it's not even worth living
[50:06] I want you to understand there were
[50:08] millionaires when Martin Luther were
[50:11] here John Wesley was here we know
[50:14] nothing about them
[50:17] we know absolutely nothing about them
[50:20] but we know a man named John Wesley
[50:25] that preached about 88 000 sermons that
[50:28] was the messenger to his day
[50:31] we know something about him because his
[50:34] work was incredibly important we know
[50:37] something about the messenger of this
[50:39] day
[50:40] That Shook the Earth
[50:43] that was allowed to be a vessel of
[50:46] Malachi 4.
[50:47] because you were the one that was
[50:50] important because this book was after
[50:52] you
[50:56] I'm thankful I thank the Lord to be here
[50:59] to kind of to be at the part of the
[51:02] starting of your life
[51:03] because starting is important
[51:08] if you're going to run a race you want
[51:10] to start right
[51:12] when you get into the blocks of running
[51:14] you want to put your feet right you want
[51:16] your breathing right you want your mind
[51:18] right you want to be focused those first
[51:21] few steps are incredibly important
[51:24] that's one of the things that this
[51:27] meeting is so important the focus is to
[51:30] make sure you're start and your
[51:33] continuation maybe many of you been here
[51:35] for years but the continuing of the work
[51:41] it is so important
[51:43] if you will turn with me to Luke chapter
[51:45] 23
[51:47] John chapter 23
[51:50] and verse 26.
[51:55] I said John it's Luke
[51:57] I'm not a bit nervous
[52:03] Luke chapter 23 and verse 26.
[52:12] I'd like to have my wife with me
[52:14] my family with me Andrew with me
[52:21] you see a miracle I may be a miracle in
[52:23] flesh he's a miracle and
[52:26] and soul
[52:28] and so you can't make your children
[52:30] Christians
[52:32] but when you see them get a supernatural
[52:34] text that's a miracle
[52:37] Luke chapter 23 and verse 26.
[52:41] and as they led him away
[52:45] they laid hold upon one Simon
[52:48] a serene
[52:50] coming out of the country and on him
[52:53] they laid the cross
[52:55] that he might bear it after Jesus
[52:59] and there followed him a great company
[53:01] of people
[53:03] and of women
[53:04] which also beweld and lamented
[53:08] but Jesus turned unto them and said
[53:11] Daughters of Jerusalem wheat not for me
[53:14] but weep for yourselves and for your
[53:17] children
[53:18] for behold the days are coming in which
[53:20] they shall say blessed are the baronen
[53:23] and the wounds that never bear
[53:26] and the paths which never gave suck
[53:30] then shall they begin to say to the
[53:33] mountains fall on us
[53:35] and to the heels cover us
[53:38] for if they do these things in a green
[53:41] tree what shall they be done in a dry
[53:45] there were also two other malfactors LED
[53:49] with him to be put to death
[53:51] and when they were come to the place
[53:54] which is called Calvary
[53:57] They Crucified him and the mouth actors
[54:01] one on the right hand and the other on
[54:04] the left
[54:05] and then Jesus then said Jesus
[54:09] father forgive them
[54:11] for they know not what they do
[54:15] and they parted his Rhema and cast lots
[54:19] and the people stood beholding and the
[54:22] rulers also which deriled him saying he
[54:26] saved others
[54:29] let him save himself if he made the
[54:32] Christ the chosen one
[54:35] and the soldiers also mocked him coming
[54:39] to him and offering him vinegar and
[54:43] saying if thou be the king of the Jews
[54:45] save thyself
[54:48] and the super subscription also that was
[54:51] written over him in letters of Greek and
[54:54] Latin and Hebrew
[54:57] this is
[54:59] the king
[55:00] of the Jews
[55:02] maybe you have a need this morning you
[55:04] just like to say Lord remember me
[55:09] father we bow our heads before you now
[55:12] this morning
[55:13] Lord needing strength not only
[55:15] recovering from long trips
[55:18] many have come from many different
[55:20] directions
[55:21] now our minds are beginning to as last
[55:25] night begin to pull us in focus of what
[55:28] our mission is here
[55:30] now Lord I pray that every devil that
[55:34] has tried to derail
[55:36] even their coming
[55:38] maybe even their thoughts we ask you now
[55:41] that you would just come now and focus
[55:43] us like never before
[55:46] Lord anoint the speaker anoint the
[55:48] hearers this morning Lord we're here to
[55:51] do business for The King and I ask you
[55:54] to anoint these young people father
[55:56] speak to our hearts Lord all the way to
[56:00] the back of the building anoint us in a
[56:02] special way in Jesus Christ's name we
[56:05] pray amen and amen and amen amen you can
[56:08] be seated
[56:13] in John chapter 16 and verse 4.
[56:18] and Jesus is speaking to his Believers
[56:20] and these things have I told you that
[56:23] that when the when the time shall come
[56:27] ye may remember what I have told you of
[56:31] them
[56:32] and these things I said not unto you at
[56:35] the beginning
[56:37] because I was with you
[56:39] notice how this book is unfolding
[56:42] it's a progressive
[56:44] and now I go my way to him that sent me
[56:49] and none of you asketh me where there
[56:52] goest thou
[56:54] but because I have said these things
[56:57] unto you sorrow hath filled your hearts
[57:01] nevertheless I tell you the truth it is
[57:05] expedient for you that I go away
[57:08] for if I go not away the comforter will
[57:11] not come unto you
[57:12] but if I depart I will send him unto you
[57:16] and when he has come he will reprove the
[57:20] world of sin and of righteousness and of
[57:22] Judgment of sin because they believe not
[57:25] on me of righteousness because I go to
[57:28] my father and ye shall see me no more of
[57:32] judgment because the prince of this
[57:35] world is judged he's saying a whole lot
[57:38] in a few sentences
[57:41] chapters are changing
[57:44] you're going to be a part of this
[57:47] you're going to shake the world
[57:50] Satan is defeated
[57:55] I have yet many things to say unto you
[57:58] but you cannot bear them now
[58:01] how be it when he the spirit of Truth
[58:03] has come he will guide you
[58:07] into all truth
[58:10] for he shall not speak of himself but
[58:13] whatsoever ye shall hear that shall he
[58:17] speak and he will show you things to
[58:20] come
[58:21] he will glorify me for he shall receive
[58:25] and of mine and shall show it unto you
[58:28] all things that the father hath are mine
[58:32] therefore said I that he shall take of
[58:36] mine and shall show it unto you
[58:40] a little while and you shall not see me
[58:43] and again a little while and you shall
[58:47] see me because I go unto the father
[58:51] brother Branham would say it like this
[58:54] and he's talking about Satan he took him
[58:57] up on a mountain
[58:58] and he set him down
[59:01] and he rebuked him again with the word
[59:05] he defeated Satan with the word of God
[59:10] now he's going to bring you into the
[59:12] picture
[59:13] and maybe none of us have seen brother
[59:16] Branham personally
[59:18] but brother Bradham is going to give us
[59:20] a nugget here for us
[59:23] defeated Satan with the word of God
[59:25] showing that the weakest of Christians
[59:30] can defeat Satan with thus saith the
[59:35] Lord
[59:36] it is written
[59:38] it is written
[59:40] it is written
[59:42] Jesus didn't do it with his power
[59:45] he did it with the word of God
[59:48] and that is the greatest weapon that you
[59:51] can have a covenant with God
[59:54] and he gives you the words of life and
[59:58] you take those words as a believer
[1:00:04] your position and you take the words of
[1:00:08] eternal life and use it on the devil
[1:00:12] he's used to being defeated with the
[1:00:14] word of God
[1:00:15] [Applause]
[1:00:19] a point would write it like this
[1:00:22] he is the first and the last
[1:00:25] the beginning and the end

[1:00:59] persecuted and brought Freedom he was
[1:01:02] dead and brought life he is risen and
[1:01:05] brings power He Reigns and brings peace

[1:04:22] I am his

[1:04:29] everything that he owns he has given it
[1:04:32] to us
[1:04:35] now tell me we're some weak where she
[1:04:38] worship
[1:04:41] where the Queen of Heaven
[1:04:43] thank you
[1:04:44] [Applause]
[1:04:50] I have read that over the last three
[1:04:53] years
[1:04:53] hundreds of times
[1:04:56] I've often thought about what it must
[1:04:58] have felt like in the room
[1:05:01] where the author was writing
[1:05:04] and the Holy Spirit was helping he put
[1:05:07] that together
[1:05:09] because there would be a lot of people
[1:05:11] like you that would need to read it
[1:05:13] again
[1:05:15] to inspire it again
[1:05:19] I've often thought about the Apostle
[1:05:22] Paul when he writes the book of Hebrews
[1:05:25] he's going to capture men's lives
[1:05:29] and maybe they lived hundreds of years
[1:05:32] maybe just only a few years
[1:05:36] and he's going to capture a portion of
[1:05:39] the lives
[1:05:40] in a sentence
[1:05:44] the book of Hebrews chapter 11 is a hall
[1:05:46] of faith
[1:05:48] people that by faith
[1:05:51] receive the promise
[1:05:53] we heard last night that Satan Stacks a
[1:05:56] lot of facts against us
[1:05:59] but whose report do we believe
[1:06:05] I exposed myself today and stand here
[1:06:08] before you they've told me over and over
[1:06:10] again of of my end and how will billion
[1:06:13] all of those different kinds of things
[1:06:15] gave me months to live set and cried
[1:06:17] with me
[1:06:18] listen they were doing their bestest
[1:06:20] doctors
[1:06:22] they're practicing Physicians trying to
[1:06:24] help Mankind we appreciate doctors and
[1:06:27] nurses and Medicine
[1:06:29] we appreciate what they do but we have a
[1:06:33] higher doctor
[1:06:35] [Applause]
[1:06:43] he may be unseen
[1:06:45] but you can feel him in the room
[1:06:49] it may not be your faith but he reaches
[1:06:52] down and grabs a halt to you
[1:06:55] and when you equipped
[1:06:58] our Prophet wanted to quit many great
[1:07:01] leaders wanted to quit maybe you've
[1:07:04] wanted to quit every great person has
[1:07:07] wanted to quit at some point
[1:07:09] but you would have quit if you could
[1:07:12] but there was a lot more chapters that
[1:07:15] had to be written
[1:07:17] there was a lot more sermons that had to
[1:07:19] be preached
[1:07:21] there's a lot more things that you've
[1:07:23] got to do in your life
[1:07:26] and maybe you can't see your future but
[1:07:29] there's books and chapters that have to
[1:07:31] be written in your life but brother Ron
[1:07:33] I'm a nobody
[1:07:36] foreign
[1:07:38] I made a lot of failures
[1:07:41] well let me let me just share a couple
[1:07:43] from background
[1:07:45] Noah was a drunk
[1:07:49] Abraham was too old
[1:07:54] Isaac was a Daydreamer
[1:07:57] Jacob was a liar
[1:08:00] Leo was ugly
[1:08:07] but she was hated
[1:08:09] but she brought forth
[1:08:14] Judah
[1:08:17] and then she would be one that would say
[1:08:20] I will now praise the Lord
[1:08:23] it didn't matter about being hated it
[1:08:26] didn't matter about being ugly
[1:08:30] listen if we could ever come to a party
[1:08:32] in our lives God made us like we are
[1:08:35] if we could ever come to the Comfort in
[1:08:37] our own spirit
[1:08:40] quit looking at pattern after Hollywood
[1:08:43] and realize that God made us us
[1:08:47] exactly how we are
[1:08:52] [Applause]
[1:08:55] tall short skinny fluffy
[1:09:02] nervous
[1:09:04] Philip I saw you look
[1:09:08] nervous
[1:09:10] stubborn
[1:09:12] high tension
[1:09:14] great passion
[1:09:16] driven
[1:09:18] God knew every element that he put in
[1:09:20] your body
[1:09:22] he knew what you would be like because
[1:09:25] he had a book that he had to write and
[1:09:27] he had your name on it
[1:09:30] [Applause]
[1:09:32] and
[1:09:34] regardless of how you feel about your
[1:09:36] Humanity
[1:09:39] that's only the Temple part he put a
[1:09:42] seed on the inside of you
[1:09:44] [Music]
[1:09:45] of eternal life
[1:09:47] the very Jean seed of God no he's not
[1:09:50] counting on your flesh
[1:09:55] he's not counting on your flesh but he
[1:09:58] has confidence in the sea that he put on
[1:10:00] the inside of you
[1:10:03] and if that seed comes to life
[1:10:06] you will realize that there's a lot of
[1:10:09] chapters that's got to be taken place
[1:10:16] Rahab was a prostitute
[1:10:21] David had a an affair
[1:10:25] and was a murderer
[1:10:28] Elijah was suicidal
[1:10:31] Jonah ran from God
[1:10:33] wound up in a great fish
[1:10:38] Joe went bankrupt
[1:10:42] even Peter
[1:10:43] after all that he saw
[1:10:46] denied the Lord
[1:10:49] he walked away
[1:10:51] cursed
[1:10:52] used abominable names
[1:11:03] the disciples fell asleep while Jesus
[1:11:06] was praying
[1:11:08] his most critical prayer
[1:11:12] his disciples fell asleep
[1:11:15] that's what gives us preachers hope
[1:11:23] [Music]
[1:11:29] the Samaritan woman was divorced over
[1:11:31] and over and over again
[1:11:34] yet Jesus went to her out of his way
[1:11:39] when the disciples
[1:11:40] couldn't see nothing good in her
[1:11:43] and no church actually wanted her
[1:11:47] Jesus said I can use her
[1:11:52] now your first few pages of your book
[1:11:55] may have a lot of these things in it
[1:12:01] you see you've written those things
[1:12:04] you've lived those things you know those
[1:12:07] things about yourself
[1:12:09] it's difficult maybe for Moses to write
[1:12:13] High tempered
[1:12:16] strapped The Rock twice
[1:12:19] difficult that he has to write his
[1:12:21] Humanity no doubt difficult for brother
[1:12:24] Branham to be honest
[1:12:26] and tell us mistakes in fact I'm glad he
[1:12:28] did
[1:12:31] I'm really glad he did that he that he
[1:12:33] just shared with us his Humanity
[1:12:37] that he made mistakes it gives you
[1:12:39] confidence to get back up
[1:12:43] [Music]
[1:12:45] let me just say oh my brother Ron this
[1:12:47] is Hollywood this is you know when I
[1:12:49] become a Christian all my troubles will
[1:12:51] be over with look around
[1:12:54] take a deep breath look around
[1:12:57] God is going to overcome and you so
[1:12:59] there's going to be some battles
[1:13:03] there's some battles that lays ahead of
[1:13:05] you
[1:13:08] there's some real difficult times that
[1:13:10] lays ahead for you there's some
[1:13:12] discouragements that lays ahead for you
[1:13:14] but it's his Divine will
[1:13:17] friends are going to walk away from you
[1:13:22] I'm talking about Bosom Buddies they're
[1:13:24] going to walk away from you and if you
[1:13:25] can only realize if they can walk away
[1:13:27] from you it wasn't your friend to start
[1:13:30] off with
[1:13:32] [Music]
[1:13:33] and let me just say if if your friends
[1:13:36] are not taking you toward God
[1:13:39] they're not your friends
[1:13:40] [Music]
[1:13:44] [Applause]
[1:13:50] if the power of your influence around
[1:13:52] you is not in a Revival of the message
[1:13:55] of the hour hungry for God hungry for
[1:13:58] church
[1:14:00] if all of their minds is just total
[1:14:02] carnality all the times they're not
[1:14:05] guiding you in the right direction
[1:14:08] [Applause]
[1:14:11] I know all of us has got friends that
[1:14:13] are in the world but let me just say
[1:14:14] this you don't let them influence your
[1:14:17] life
[1:14:28] by faith Abraham
[1:14:31] by faith Jacob
[1:14:36] by faith Moses
[1:14:41] by faith
[1:14:43] Joshua
[1:14:47] by faith or Ahab
[1:14:50] if you'll notice
[1:14:53] he mentions her
[1:14:55] here
[1:14:57] God's not ashamed that she was a harlot
[1:15:03] he's not ashamed of where you are
[1:15:09] now let me just say God knows how to
[1:15:11] take the actor's mask off
[1:15:15] he knows the real you
[1:15:17] [Applause]
[1:15:19] and so he wants the real you to know the
[1:15:23] real him
[1:15:27] Rahab knew that these two spies had
[1:15:30] something
[1:15:31] that she had never
[1:15:33] never had in her life
[1:15:36] she had met a lot of men from that City
[1:15:39] but none of them had what they had
[1:15:43] and circumstances of Life had bound her
[1:15:46] to that position
[1:15:49] circumstances and chains kept her there
[1:15:52] working on the wall in the red light
[1:15:55] district
[1:15:56] but God
[1:16:02] knew if I can only get the pen out of
[1:16:05] her hand
[1:16:09] and put it in my hat
[1:16:12] I've got a plan for her
[1:16:17] if God can only get the pen of Will and
[1:16:21] self-will out of your hands
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:26] and get it into his hand
[1:16:28] and you become a prisoner to Jesus
[1:16:31] Christ
[1:16:32] a love slave
[1:16:37] oh my brother Ron I have to do this and
[1:16:40] I have to give up this if you ever meet
[1:16:42] Jesus
[1:16:43] there's nothing in this world that
[1:16:45] matters anymore
[1:16:47] Super Bowls won't matter no more
[1:16:49] Hollywood won't matter no more racing
[1:16:52] won't matter no more rock and roll won't
[1:16:55] matter anymore
[1:16:58] [Applause]
[1:17:00] you and Jesus are a majority
[1:17:05] [Music]
[1:17:07] the scripture says in Hebrews 11 32 and
[1:17:12] notice how Paul begins to write these
[1:17:14] things he said what more shall I say
[1:17:16] for the time should fail me to tell you
[1:17:19] of Gideon
[1:17:21] I loved that last night
[1:17:23] on a balark
[1:17:25] and of Samson
[1:17:27] and of jaffna and of David
[1:17:31] and of Samuel
[1:17:32] and of the prophets
[1:17:36] been
[1:17:37] these men live phenomenal lives
[1:17:41] had phenomenal Supernatural lives
[1:17:45] David kills a giant with a stone
[1:17:49] Moses stands and watches the water raise
[1:17:52] up
[1:17:53] Sampson puts his hand on the pillars and
[1:17:55] he's blind and he pushes and kills more
[1:17:59] people at his death than all of his life
[1:18:03] but when God looks at it through the
[1:18:05] prophet Paul he just mentions the name
[1:18:08] all in a sentence
[1:18:13] well brother Ron but I didn't get a full
[1:18:16] chapter in the Bible don't matter
[1:18:21] all right maybe you're like shamgar
[1:18:26] and you just got one scripture
[1:18:30] in my whole book
[1:18:32] but one man
[1:18:36] got so tired
[1:18:39] of the enemy coming into his camp
[1:18:46] and God would take brother Branham
[1:18:49] The Seer of the word
[1:18:51] the one that could look in the Garden of
[1:18:53] Eden and see exactly what Eve looked
[1:18:55] like
[1:18:57] and exactly what the serpent looked like
[1:18:59] and how they walked out of the Garden of
[1:19:02] Eden could also look in
[1:19:04] shamgar's life
[1:19:09] oh my brother on maybe he was making up
[1:19:11] a story really
[1:19:15] and he begins to talk about him
[1:19:17] and as he begins to talk about him said
[1:19:19] no doubt the enemy had came year after
[1:19:22] year after year
[1:19:24] and had taken
[1:19:26] all the crop and left him just enough to
[1:19:28] get him through the till next camp
[1:19:29] meeting
[1:19:32] and it could get back to the next Youth
[1:19:34] Camp
[1:19:37] and here comes 600 Philistines armed
[1:19:40] trained soldiers
[1:19:42] he wasn't a soldier he was a farmer
[1:19:47] and he said he looked over at his wife
[1:19:49] and how skinny she was and
[1:19:54] threads on her clothes was just Barren
[1:19:56] and he explains it in great detail
[1:20:00] because God remembers
[1:20:05] God remembers it may have been thousands
[1:20:07] of years later but one scripture was
[1:20:10] important to the prophet and it was
[1:20:12] important to God
[1:20:14] don't tell me your life is not important
[1:20:16] to God
[1:20:18] don't tell me you're a nobody maybe the
[1:20:21] enemy has come with 600 Devils to your
[1:20:25] house day after day after day and trying
[1:20:27] to destroy you

[1:20:37] something responded in the inside of of
[1:20:40] shamgar that he was a Seed of Abraham
[1:20:44] and he remembered that in the word that
[1:20:47] Abraham had set with Melchizedek and
[1:20:49] Melchizedek had said thy said shall
[1:20:53] possess the gates of their enemy

[1:22:30] comes around that wasn't just William
[1:22:32] branham's phrase about you that was
[1:22:35] God's phrase
[1:22:38] God saved you till the end of the layout
[1:22:41] of seal
[1:22:43] knowing the wars that were going to come
[1:22:45] against you the spirits are going to
[1:22:48] come against you
[1:22:51] brother Brown said your mother faced ten
[1:22:53] times the Devils that are her mother
[1:22:55] face
[1:22:57] then you're the Next Generation faces a
[1:22:59] hundred times what the mother face
[1:23:01] then it multiplies to a thousand
[1:23:07] but God didn't leave you depleted
[1:23:13] I want you to punch your neighbor and
[1:23:15] tell him that preacher is talking about
[1:23:17] you
[1:23:26] it's all about you
[1:23:29] it's all about you Marcus I'm talking
[1:23:31] about you
[1:23:33] talking about you
[1:23:36] come on you came a long way and I picked
[1:23:38] you out he's talking about you
[1:23:42] he's talking about you back there
[1:23:44] Carl I'm talking about you
[1:23:46] sorry sister Carter
[1:23:49] that's my sister
[1:23:52] listen I'm talking about you
[1:23:57] I'm talking about every one of you and I
[1:23:59] want to get this right brother you know
[1:24:01] I'm done by you
[1:24:05] we're an invincible Army
[1:24:09] because we will not pay attention to the
[1:24:12] facts
[1:24:16] [Applause]
[1:24:24] [Applause]
[1:24:28] yeah we could get killed here in a few
[1:24:30] minutes destroyed
[1:24:33] what are you gonna do I got a stick
[1:24:40] can you imagine what the family was
[1:24:42] doing
[1:24:43] somebody's got a shout
[1:24:46] somebody's got to sing
[1:24:50] so his family was back I don't know near
[1:24:52] the barn
[1:24:54] while he was in the field with a stick
[1:24:57] in his hand
[1:24:59] and he's going to whip him so bad
[1:25:02] I can heal it
[1:25:05] as he knocks the last one down scream I
[1:25:08] don't never come back
[1:25:14] [Applause]
[1:25:21] [Applause]
[1:25:25] all right
[1:25:26] now it's your turn why don't you tell
[1:25:29] those less devils
[1:25:31] music devils
[1:25:36] those backslidden Devils why don't you
[1:25:39] tell them why you hit them in the head
[1:25:43] don't come back no more
[1:25:46] foreign
[1:26:02] [Applause]
[1:26:13] no
[1:26:14] here's what I want you to do this is
[1:26:16] exercise part of it
[1:26:19] because the most Supernatural thing
[1:26:21] about you is your tongue
[1:26:26] and it has the power
[1:26:28] to produce a negative atmosphere
[1:26:34] or it has the power to speak the spoken
[1:26:37] word
[1:26:39] do you know why we sink
[1:26:42] we sing testimonies
[1:26:45] victory is mine victory is mine
[1:26:50] there is going to be a meeting in the
[1:26:52] air
[1:26:53] and you pass those powerful inspired
[1:26:56] words across your lips
[1:26:59] and your ears hear what you are saying
[1:27:03] because your voice is different than
[1:27:05] anybody else's voice
[1:27:08] and God hears your voice through the
[1:27:12] blood
[1:27:17] are you with me now
[1:27:19] we're getting to some good parts
[1:27:22] why don't you pick up your six foot
[1:27:25] stick
[1:27:28] and I want to hear you say
[1:27:31] not your neighbor I want you to say to
[1:27:34] the devil don't come back
[1:27:38] now say it with attitude
[1:27:42] you're getting a
[1:27:43] dog come back
[1:27:50] [Applause]
[1:28:06] I'm going to share something with you
[1:28:08] that I probably shouldn't
[1:28:11] preachers do that
[1:28:16] but
[1:28:17] in my life I've been a boxing fan
[1:28:26] you know because God was going to make
[1:28:28] me a boxer
[1:28:31] and I spent about an hour here
[1:28:35] knocking the enemy out
[1:28:39] brother Branham was a boxer
[1:28:42] and he was going to be honest with you
[1:28:43] that's why I got started liking boxing
[1:28:47] because I was a little boy out here
[1:28:49] brother Brandon talking about his fights
[1:28:51] talk about training and talking about
[1:28:53] hitting with the left and hitting with
[1:28:54] the right
[1:28:56] now that all got me in trouble when I
[1:28:58] became a late teenager because I
[1:29:01] practiced it
[1:29:10] one of the greatest Corner men was a man
[1:29:13] named Angelo Dundee
[1:29:16] Angelo Dungey was not a fighter but he
[1:29:19] knew how to coach
[1:29:21] some of the greatest that ever lived
[1:29:24] Aaron you're going to love this
[1:29:27] I can just hear it in a few sermons from
[1:29:29] now brother Ron said
[1:29:37] Angelo Dundee said when I would have
[1:29:40] Muhammad Ali in in the boxing match
[1:29:44] he said I didn't have to teach him how
[1:29:47] to fight
[1:29:48] he knew how to fight
[1:29:50] he he said but I had to remind him of
[1:29:53] who he was
[1:30:01] thank you
[1:30:03] [Applause]
[1:30:09] so many times he was getting whipped and
[1:30:11] outpointed
[1:30:13] he said I didn't tell him about lefts
[1:30:15] and rights
[1:30:17] he didn't tell him about ducking his
[1:30:19] head he said I had to tell him you are
[1:30:22] the champion
[1:30:26] you are the champion
[1:30:28] now go fight lasiks
[1:30:31] [Applause]
[1:30:39] I like one of the things he said that
[1:30:42] other guy knows you're the champion
[1:30:44] yeah
[1:30:45] he believes you're the champion
[1:30:49] who says coming so give it to him
[1:31:00] [Applause]
[1:31:04] now let me just say this to you if I can
[1:31:06] be Angelo Dundee for a few minutes
[1:31:09] I don't have to tell you how to fight
[1:31:13] it's on the inside of you
[1:31:16] I don't have to give you the weapons
[1:31:18] you've already got it
[1:31:20] I just got to remind you of Who You Are
[1:31:25] okay if you're 13 or you're 35.
[1:31:29] you're a champion
[1:31:32] your bill can do the job
[1:31:45] [Applause]
[1:31:51] now
[1:31:52] in a book
[1:31:56] in a book
[1:31:57] you're right in it
[1:32:00] and sometimes you remember the difficult
[1:32:02] parts
[1:32:05] and Satan will bring those difficult
[1:32:07] Parts back to you because he don't
[1:32:09] really have a lot to work with
[1:32:11] once you know who you are
[1:32:14] all he can do is pick on your flesh and
[1:32:16] your memory and your conscience and he
[1:32:18] wants to remind you and keep you
[1:32:19] defeated
[1:32:23] so
[1:32:25] can you give me about 10 more minutes
[1:32:30] [Applause]
[1:32:42] well brother Ron You Don't Preach like
[1:32:44] you used to well
[1:32:46] I had to reinvent myself a little bit
[1:32:52] just because I got cancer in my lungs
[1:32:55] and it hurts when I preach don't mean I
[1:32:57] quit
[1:32:59] I just learned how to fight a little
[1:33:01] different
[1:33:04] that means my lefts and rights come
[1:33:06] quick and they come harsh and
[1:33:10] foreign
[1:33:19] [Applause]
[1:33:26] his book had been a horrible book
[1:33:31] it would be something that you would
[1:33:33] read in Halloween
[1:33:37] it was horrendous
[1:33:39] it was nothing to be proud of
[1:33:43] he had made failure after failure after
[1:33:46] failure we don't know nothing about his
[1:33:48] family
[1:33:49] we don't know nothing about him other
[1:33:51] than he's in jail
[1:33:55] I'm being in jail he's incarcerated and
[1:33:57] anybody can live right in jail
[1:34:03] well I think I've found some people
[1:34:05] that's been in jail before
[1:34:12] and so he's in jail he's he's been
[1:34:15] caught
[1:34:19] the law says that he's got to die
[1:34:22] now you would think
[1:34:25] as he's coming into his final week that
[1:34:28] this is the last chapter
[1:34:31] but this is only the beginning
[1:34:36] now today it's a strange sort of day
[1:34:40] he's going to die with a God that's
[1:34:43] had a book like his
[1:34:46] but there's another man
[1:34:52] there's another man that's with him he
[1:34:55] don't deserve to die
[1:34:58] he's he'll sick
[1:35:00] he's fed thousands
[1:35:02] he's turned water into wine
[1:35:07] now this this thief has never heard a
[1:35:10] sermon
[1:35:12] he's never saw a miracle
[1:35:16] he's going to have to carry his cross up
[1:35:19] the hill
[1:35:20] but he's going to witness something
[1:35:24] he's going to witness a man
[1:35:27] as he walks out
[1:35:29] and starts up the journey that refuses
[1:35:32] to quit
[1:35:37] he immediately notices that he's been
[1:35:40] beaten
[1:35:41] like no other human being
[1:35:44] has ever been beaten
[1:35:46] he can see the pulsation of his lungs
[1:35:49] and the pulsations of his organs in his
[1:35:51] body
[1:35:55] what
[1:35:57] screaming down through his cloth
[1:36:00] little dots become big dots
[1:36:05] he can see the human fatigue setting in
[1:36:08] on him
[1:36:09] but he refuses to quit putting one foot
[1:36:12] in front of the other
[1:36:15] maybe you don't understand why their
[1:36:18] stripes are there
[1:36:20] but they're there for Erica
[1:36:23] [Music]
[1:36:25] they're there for you
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:28] listen don't ever give up
[1:36:32] don't you ever give up
[1:36:35] I say this to you when it comes and it
[1:36:38] seems like all is hopeless let me just
[1:36:41] say God's got it he's the doctor
[1:36:48] he didn't quit neither said way
[1:36:51] he didn't get The Strokes neither should
[1:36:54] we
[1:36:58] maybe it was possible in his mind you
[1:37:00] see he hadn't got to read the book
[1:37:03] maybe it's possible by his mind
[1:37:06] and Jesus didn't have time to turn
[1:37:07] around and say
[1:37:09] I'm doing this for Tim Pruitt
[1:37:18] I'm doing this for Karen
[1:37:22] you see she wasn't defeated
[1:37:27] oh but brother on if you could have only
[1:37:30] saw what I saw I was here with you
[1:37:34] but if you could see
[1:37:36] like brother Donnie was anointed to
[1:37:39] speak her funeral
[1:37:40] and look across the Veil
[1:37:47] she's got a new body
[1:37:50] that's what Jesus was walking up the
[1:37:52] hill for
[1:37:54] because it was in the book
[1:37:57] and Elijah and Moses had stood there
[1:38:00] with him
[1:38:01] on the Mount of transfiguration and told
[1:38:03] him what the word said
[1:38:07] he had to accomplish it
[1:38:09] if I can say this to you today we must
[1:38:12] accomplish our work
[1:38:16] s are screaming at a store we must
[1:38:19] accomplish
[1:38:24] we must finish this
[1:38:28] [Applause]
[1:38:28] [Music]
[1:38:32] he watches every step that he takes
[1:38:36] there's blood in it
[1:38:43] if you look at his own Footprints and
[1:38:45] there was no blood
[1:38:49] the man with him there was no blood
[1:38:52] but this man had blood
[1:38:55] nobody was screaming their name saying
[1:38:58] Blasphemous names
[1:39:00] they deserved it
[1:39:03] they deserve to die
[1:39:05] that book was written so that the
[1:39:08] Justice was that they died
[1:39:12] but this man
[1:39:15] Satan would not let him die
[1:39:19] without extremely punishment
[1:39:22] not just to his body but to his mind
[1:39:27] so they screamed at him all kind of
[1:39:30] horrible words
[1:39:33] they offered him vinegar
[1:39:37] they said incredibly bad things about
[1:39:39] him
[1:39:41] but he kept stepping
[1:39:45] this man heard the moans
[1:39:48] this man heard the cross
[1:39:51] because Jesus had to die as a man
[1:39:57] as that man he had to suffer
[1:40:00] Adam fell
[1:40:03] if Satan would have only knew what was
[1:40:06] happening today
[1:40:08] Jesus would have had Band-Aids all over
[1:40:11] him
[1:40:13] he would have made him King of the
[1:40:15] universe
[1:40:17] he'd never let him go to counseling
[1:40:20] but God shall hear himself
[1:40:26] if he only knew who he was
[1:40:30] and he only knew who he was
[1:40:32] he would not torment you another day
[1:40:36] he would not matter you another day
[1:40:41] because at the end of the day your
[1:40:43] testing on it
[1:40:46] will destroy him
[1:40:49] therefore that fights against you every
[1:40:52] demon of hair that tries to destroy you
[1:41:00] against them
[1:41:06] cause his kingdom to come to an end
[1:41:13] [Applause]
[1:41:22] Nails in his hands
[1:41:28] Nails in his feet
[1:41:31] the groans
[1:41:37] people are screaming all different kind
[1:41:39] of things
[1:41:43] because I'll be the Christ
[1:41:45] you saved others
[1:41:51] save yourself
[1:41:53] the greatest compliment they could ever
[1:41:55] pay him
[1:41:58] you saved others save yourself
[1:42:07] one Thief screams across at him
[1:42:10] if you are the Christ
[1:42:14] save us
[1:42:18] makes all kind of fun of it
[1:42:27] and the other one
[1:42:28] that's all of this
[1:42:30] took it into his mind
[1:42:34] he wasn't thinking about how great he
[1:42:35] was
[1:42:37] he knew in a few minutes
[1:42:39] he's going to die
[1:42:42] and this is what he deserved
[1:42:48] he never heard a sermon on a mount
[1:42:51] had never seen him touch the leopard
[1:42:54] he never heard Lazarus come forth
[1:43:03] but he had enough pressure in his lungs
[1:43:06] that he could say
[1:43:07] Lord
[1:43:17] when you come into your kingdom
[1:43:23] remember me
[1:43:31] remember me
[1:43:37] his book started
[1:43:41] Christ where his book started
[1:43:45] everything else didn't matter now
[1:43:48] being a thief
[1:43:50] having a wretched life
[1:43:53] it didn't matter now
[1:43:56] his blood
[1:44:00] of all the miracles of Jesus the last
[1:44:03] one was the costliest
[1:44:08] it must have been a complete Paradox all
[1:44:11] of these preachers on the ground making
[1:44:13] fun
[1:44:16] all these great religious people making
[1:44:18] sure that he dies
[1:44:20] [Music]
[1:44:21] they had scream crucify him
[1:44:24] and here's a man with a destroyed book
[1:44:28] screaming remember me
[1:44:34] God's got a memory
[1:44:37] God's got a memory
[1:44:40] how important is remember me
[1:44:45] I don't know for this local audience can
[1:44:47] I just put an expert here
[1:44:49] last week by the Carmen meals we listen
[1:44:52] to him together
[1:44:54] brother Carmen Mills

[1:44:58] on God's memory

[1:45:04] under anointing
[1:45:08] so this is my time
[1:45:12] almost a month ago I announced to the
[1:45:15] audience of what I was going to speak
[1:45:16] here I never do that
[1:45:19] or what will you be remembered for
[1:45:25] I told brother Tim I said God's got
[1:45:27] something in plans
[1:45:31] I want you to catch it now
[1:45:32] God's got something in his plans
[1:45:37] I preached this two times before one in
[1:45:39] Switzerland
[1:45:41] every time I preached it phenomenal
[1:45:43] Miracles happened
[1:45:46] and the same gods in the building now
[1:45:51] [Applause]
[1:46:00] I don't know about your book I we don't
[1:46:02] have time for you to tell every page of
[1:46:04] your book
[1:46:06] but you being here
[1:46:11] you being here
[1:46:13] tell us this that God has gathered you
[1:46:16] [Music]
[1:46:18] because he has remembered you
[1:46:23] he put something on you inside of you
[1:46:27] on these days

[1:46:31] of you that you had to get here

[1:46:39] excited to get here

[1:46:47] was under inspiration to be in this camp
[1:46:51] you didn't know what you'd be saying
[1:46:53] that
[1:46:56] it never be raining like it is
[1:47:02] maybe your book's got a lot of scars
[1:47:06] and you're not so proud of it
[1:47:10] if you could look over tonight and say
[1:47:14] Remember Me Lord
[1:47:18] remember me
[1:47:22] remember me
[1:47:27] and Jesus
[1:47:29] turns to him
[1:47:33] and says this day
[1:47:39] you're talking about a change of a book
[1:47:43] you check I'm talking about a change of
[1:47:45] Heaven and Hell
[1:47:48] in hell you fall
[1:47:51] you Falls like an endless eternity
[1:47:54] there's no friends in hell
[1:47:57] there's weeping and nation of teeth
[1:48:00] the Holocaust is like a Sunday afternoon
[1:48:03] picnic
[1:48:04] it's a horrendous place to go no friends
[1:48:07] there
[1:48:08] no parties there
[1:48:12] it's done
[1:48:15] to flip it to a place where Satan can
[1:48:18] never touch you again
[1:48:22] [Applause]
[1:48:33] this day
[1:48:37] this day
[1:48:40] you'll be with me
[1:48:42] in Paradise
[1:48:45] I don't know how I felt
[1:48:47] I don't know what sensation he felt
[1:48:54] but his destination was different
[1:49:00] [Applause]
[1:49:10] we do not know how he died
[1:49:13] we don't know the exact minute that he
[1:49:15] left the Earth
[1:49:17] but it was not a demon coming to get him
[1:49:21] [Music]
[1:49:24] it was an angel
[1:49:27] became his Uber driver
[1:49:32] you see that man throughout his life and
[1:49:35] his decades that he lived didn't know he
[1:49:37] was destined for that
[1:49:40] God had bigger plans the woman at the
[1:49:43] well didn't know she was destined for
[1:49:45] that Rahab didn't know she was destined
[1:49:48] for that
[1:49:48] maybe you didn't know you were destined
[1:49:51] for that
[1:49:53] but God's got big plans in your life
[1:50:02] maybe you show up at church and
[1:50:03] Timothy's preaching
[1:50:08] God changes your book
[1:50:12] maybe brother Donnie leaves these quotes
[1:50:14] for a little bit
[1:50:15] and leaves his portion that he's had and
[1:50:17] all of a sudden you become in the
[1:50:18] picture and you go my God that man's
[1:50:20] talking about me God's got plans for you
[1:50:25] that's what this meeting is all about
[1:50:27] God's got plans for you
[1:50:33] as I finish let me just say this to you
[1:50:35] it wasn't that you picked you
[1:50:38] God picked you
[1:50:42] [Applause]
[1:50:54] you see us he's looking
[1:50:57] and knowing who's going to
[1:50:59] be in every age
[1:51:05] and he picks brother Branham as the last
[1:51:08] Church age messenger
[1:51:10] then he's going to pick seed
[1:51:13] that will believe that
[1:51:16] now he's got to have some that's
[1:51:18] in brother Brandon's meetings
[1:51:22] and they'll sit and say amen and that's
[1:51:24] a prophet that's Elijah
[1:51:26] but just before Resurrection
[1:51:29] he's got to have young people
[1:51:35] that will literally live in the darkness
[1:51:37] of laodicea
[1:51:43] and know that they can't do it on their
[1:51:45] own
[1:51:47] it's so dark they can't make it so they
[1:51:50] know
[1:51:51] that if God don't pick up the pen
[1:51:55] if God don't pick up my pen
[1:52:00] I'm going to make a mess out of my life
[1:52:03] I'm going to choose the wrong mate I'm
[1:52:05] gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna have the wrong
[1:52:06] job I'm going to wind up out of church
[1:52:10] but if God picks up your pen
[1:52:15] he knows where he needs you at
[1:52:19] [Applause]
[1:52:29] now you see a few years ago
[1:52:32] that guy that's standing over there
[1:52:34] no that's not Goliath
[1:52:37] that's one of Goliath's killers
[1:52:41] it was in a meeting like this that
[1:52:44] he was just enjoying writing a book but
[1:52:47] now God needed him to be a preacher
[1:52:53] and I'm sure that that evening
[1:52:56] you know no man calls a man to preach we
[1:52:58] just kind of recognize the gift and
[1:53:03] there's no way that
[1:53:05] you would have thought that guy's going
[1:53:07] to be a convention speaker
[1:53:11] but that guy's a phenomenal preacher
[1:53:16] listen I am not bragging on him I'm
[1:53:18] bragging on the gift that's in him
[1:53:21] you see he had to lay the pin down
[1:53:28] football coach teacher he had to lay the
[1:53:30] pin down
[1:53:32] because God needed him well he did good
[1:53:34] at your place brother Donnie
[1:53:36] God needed him to allow him to pick him
[1:53:40] up
[1:53:42] and now write with him
[1:53:45] yeah
[1:53:46] no longer his ambition writing with him
[1:53:50] listen you being that Prescott's coach
[1:53:53] that don't mean nothing
[1:53:55] but you inspiring young people like this
[1:54:11] that's what it's about
[1:54:15] that's what you'll be remembered for
[1:54:23] [Applause]

[1:54:36] but I'll come to this
