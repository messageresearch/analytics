able to assemble ourselves together to sing to worship to pray now we've come to the portion of the word we're asking you lord for your help our needs are many and yet our god is greater than all of

day no one's sick no one's tired no one weary we're not going anywhere we don't have any watches no schedule nobody will complain nobody will be angry nobody will ever be upset everybody will have the best neighbors on the street i'm talking about miracle after miracle afternoon this is not a figment of our imagination it's the truth amen the gracious and that in the name of the lord jesus what an honor it is to be here tonight with my brothers and my friend brother tim and uh it still feels a little bit odd sister karen not being here we certainly miss our sister we certainly loved her we wouldn't call her back to this whole world for nothing in this world way amen we certainly want to continue to pray for the family let's turn if you would tonight to the book of ephesians chapter 6 verse 11. very familiar scriptures that we're going to read tonight i trust the lord will open it to our understanding put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil and the word riles is trickery and craftiness for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and high places now listen to this hierarchy that is in the fallen angel realm remember when god created the angels initially they were all good angels but some of them left their first estate so paul describes them and uses the first word there against principalities the greek word is archaii which means the first in order so there's principalities there's powers and there's rulers of the darkness of this world this is what you and i face every day of our lives we cannot face these things by ourself rulers or the word there is actually prince princes of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high or the word there is heavenly in heavenly places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that ye may be able ye may be able which is have power whether by virtue of one's own ability or a resource other than yourself to be capable strong and powerful that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand oh my therefore having your loins gird about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god you notice this armor there's not one piece for your back every bit of it is right here why god don't want you running from the devil the bible tells me and you submit yourself therefore in the mighty hand of god resist the devil and he will flee from you let me read you this quote here from satan's eden in 1965 i thought i would try to bring something to your mind with these scriptures i got written here that would enlighten you to know make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now to learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you see that's the main thing and when you get time sometime look up how many times he said that that's the main thing i wonder sometimes if we don't make the main thing other things it's not the main thing and the main thing we let go because we don't think it's deep i suppose but notice the way he says this so that you can block everything before it gets to you so not that god wants you to make mistakes and fall and then get up and go through the whole process of doing all that that's not overcoming but god wants to teach us how to block it before it ever gets to us that's what i want that's the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can now we know the way life is there's so much of it we just can't keep off but i don't know about you i'd like to keep all of them off that i could you know i think not only would brother branham have this desire but every god-called man in this day would want this desire as a preacher don't you appreciate such man of god may god bless his word you may be seated i want to speak to you on standing in the evil day we all know that it's a terrible time in this hour we're dealing with darkness that the world has never known before we ourselves have been under an onslaught around the world uh this coveted situations brother ron mentioned it last night many pastors have passed away pastors wives evangelists we've never had anything really that's affected the message as far as pestilence and things like that quite like this has it's changed so many things about our world and yet we know that is only part of what we are dealing with but by looking at what paul said he gave us a little bit of an insight as to the hierarchy of evil spirits and we know that when god created the angels that he made them in an order and satan himself as though even as much as we are against him yet he still has an order in his kingdom and he operates what paul was dealing with was the order by which satan comes against the people of god now here tonight we've got several hundred people here in the building but you know it as well as i do that there are many more beings that are unseen than there are that are visible and we know that it comes in every gathering like this and they come to be able to torment they're also the angels of god which are the beings of light they're here to influence us in a supernatural way every day of our life we're pulled in this realm the prophet tells us there's three realms above us and three realms below us and we're here in the middle in the stream of time every one of us that are human beings get caught under that influence and we know that because we are still creatures of time our bodies our minds our spirits are still affected by such things and we know that the bible doesn't really open it up too much from all the way down to give us a view into that but on the occasion we're able to see what that supernatural realm was like daniel is one of the books that opens it up to us and we know that of course that a prophet once a prophet appears on the earth that a prophet is a window to the supernatural a prophet does not actually make the supernatural but he's just a gift of god by which god can project him into that realm and open up what was already there and he comes back and tells us what was there so it equips us as god's believing children it happened that way in the days of daniel the term if you would to the book of daniel chapter 10 verse 12 then said he unto me fear not daniel now this is the angel gabriel that is sent to daniel because daniel had set his mind and his heart and his soul to seek god and he began to pray and he had prayed and prayed and prayed and he had sought god for 21 days and yet there was no answer there was nothing supernatural that had happened and no doubt daniel was very much perplexed as we can get sometimes and we know that whenever we pray and god doesn't move for us immediately it's not that our prayers are not being heard but sometimes there's things going on in the other realm it is a great battle that is going on or god is saying wait be patient i've got something greater that i'm going to do but here we have an incident that was unlike anything else that's written in the entire canon of scripture and we get our first view into a glimpse of a supernatural war the way it was going on now notice the angel gabriel as he comes to daniel and he says from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy god thy words were heard so you imagine daniel saying well if i was heard the first day why did it take you 21 to get here so why did it take 21 days for me praying me chastening my soul me before god every day crying out to god but notice he said thy words were heard and i am come for thy words so here is the angel gabriel which ranks very highly knowing the economy of god and he was sent to daniel and his the first thing that he does is bring comfort to daniel before he gives him an explanation of why there was a delay in his prayer now watch now we're going to get into the reason why there was a delay but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me one and twenty days okay so here is the angel gabriel telling daniel why there was a delay in his prayer the prince of the kingdom of persia so here is a being that is described as a prince but we know this was not darius it was not cyrus it was not the son of cyrus because he was now king but it was a prince or a demon which had been chosen under the hierarchy of satan to be the demon that would influence this great empire now you know it might seem a little bit odd and peculiar to us and we look at politics and we think well it's all determined by votes it's all determined by this and that who can get the most money let me tell you it's not determined by that at all god is the one who will have his sovereignty that's right now listen this the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me one in 20 days now here we're talking about the angel gabriel which was sent to mary the angel gabriel which was sent to daniel he's mentioned a few times in the bible and we know that he was one of the archai or the principal angels that stayed in his original position with god but this prince of persia we don't know his name but the prince of persia actually outranked gabriel in power now he was a fallen angel but he still maintained his hierarchy now friends i'm going to tell you something there's no way you and i are going to be able to face such demons if an angel gabriel that never thought a bad thought never said a bad word never lied never stole never cheated never done anything wrong and yet gabriel could not withstand this prince of persia how can you and i unless our champion unless our champion lives inside of us the prince of the kingdom of persia which stood in me one and 20 days but lo michael and the word michael of course means one who is like god and the prophet tells us who michael was michael was christ but lo michael one of the chief now notice categorically that this is a higher category than gabriel or this other prince this one is called a chief prince a chief prince now remember there were cherubims seraphims zooms and they were all created in a hierarchy by the plan of god because god knew before the foundation of the world that satan would fall he was not created as we know him today as diablos or lucifer but he was created as the son of the morning this is what he was the son of the morning one of his names and titles was the day star so he was the next man right next to god question answer in 1959 he was god's right-hand man to fellowship so when god wanted to fellowship with anyone it was with this day star that he fellowship as a matter of fact according to what the bible tells us in the book of isaiah that he was the one that god had said thou art the anointed cherub and i have set thee soul that was created perfect until iniquity was found in thee so god did not create him the devil but god created him a great bright and shining angel as a matter of fact he was in charge of the music department in heaven this is why he uses music today because he said the day the tie pipes and harps and tablets so he was in charge of music these beings once they fell they unlike what you and i would think that they would lose all of their capacity all their ability they didn't now you think of a devil that would be a cold devil now he's a bad devil if you've got a bad cold for sure but he's nothing like a cancer devil and apparently this covet dude is a bad devil now think about it that there's other demons there's only one devil that as far as we know that ever got out away from the prophet's control from time to time and that was epilepsy now he would tell the parents keep their kids near them because that one was really stubborn he must have ranked high in the hierarchy now when satan fell and then he began to preach to these other angels and they fell with him by their own choice and remember there is no redemption for angels once they ever fall the blood wasn't shed for angels it was shed for you so once angels fall then they fell from their hierarchy but they never lost their gifts you notice well as i do that many of the great country music stars and rock and roll stars and many of those people where did they get their start in church so why whenever they backslide don't god take their voice why don't god take their gift so god did not take away the influence and the ability of these fallen angels to be able to influence humanity and even outrank some of those angels that never fail oh you're listening to me ain't you now can you imagine gabriel one that had stayed in the presence of god and had kept his estate and he comes down now he said because daniel is praying asking god about what's going on now if you know this history you know that someone is moving and we know that it was during the time of zerubbabel that zerubbabel was doing a great work in jerusalem and there was something that was moving on the samaritans and they were there trying to send a message back and forth back and forth and they're saying these people are nuts over here in jerusalem and they're trying to rebel against the king well what was going on on the earth was only a reflection of what was going on in the world that is unseen now this prince of persia had been chosen for this purpose and that was the characteristics and traits of his makeup would be that he would be very effective under the dominion of the persian kingdom but he would not work in the next kingdom that was coming he would definitely not work in the roman kingdom now think of it satan knows which demon to send to which kingdom i wish somebody would preach with me tonight it's the same way with you you see our enemy studies us he knows our strengths he knows our weaknesses he knows our failures it would probably scare us tonight if we knew how well our enemy knows us and when we think that we are in control and we go to playing around with little sins a little saying oh i've got this i'm good i've got it no you haven't no you haven't when that devil sees you doing that and hears you saying that all night it tickles him to death notice this michael one of the chief princes came to help me now there's one thing i do like about this attitude about this angel he had no problem in admitting that he needed help a lot of the message folks you know they really do a lot of time they come to the pastor time they come to a man of god for prayer they've already backslid done give up and everything else but at least this angel recognized that he needed help now we're talking about a being that is a said never sin never done anything wrong but by the original administration that father had given to this gabriel he was not given the authority you say why would god ever send him i don't have a clue you can ask him when we get there but god remember gabriel is always the messenger to the jews so in the high or the hierarchy of god according to the divine protocol you remember god has a way by which he speaks to his people so god is going to use the angel gabriel dealing with the jews and when gabriel goes he cannot break through so he's warring however angels would war and the warning actually what's going on is it's the warring of the politics inside of the kingdom so now sympathies which is the son of cyrus is now the king and there's people inside the kingdom that hate the jews now what this prince of persia is doing he's playing in the realm of politics so he's whispering to the king he's whispering to all the other people hate them jews and them jews are doing this and them jews are doing that so the prince of persia was warring in the court of the king you understand what i'm saying but here was the angel gabriel and he was warring and he was whispering to the king and whispering to the magistrates and the delegates no no no you need to give them permission to go ahead and rebuild the wall and to do this and doing that and these mortals were caught in between the two voices they were hearing the voice of the prince of persia and they were hearing the voice of gabriel but they themselves not being spiritual not even knowing where it's come from don't you understand why the greatest battle that's ever been fought is in our mind here we set tonight as the people of god my if all of our thoughts could be displayed on this great big screen behind us there wouldn't be enough people in here to work what might even turn off the lights i get in 10 minutes with it you imagine all the thoughts has come through our mind this week but yet a real child of god knows from your heart no impure nothing defiled nothing comes out of your heart but pure genuine holiness if you've got the new burst the true baptism of the holy ghost but remember your mind is that battleground satan will bombard you with his thoughts and god bombards you with his thoughts and any battlefield it's got great cater oh my it's got holes everywhere and it's blowed here and blowed there that's why sometimes it feels like we're about to lose our mind why because the battle is raging i mean it knows what i'm preaching about tonight but as the people of god we have the ability to cast down imagination and cast down everything that exalts itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of jesus christ oh my michael one of the chief princes came to help me and i remained there with the kings or the royal family of persia now what's here gabriel is giving this insight to daniel so daniel can understand so now he's finally released and he's able to move because michael has overpowered this prince of persia then whenever michael overpowered him it released gabriel and gabriel was able to come down and stand on the river hit a kill and as he stood there in the gold and all that he saw about him and the great angelic appearance it must have been to him but what was it that made this way for him to do this it was israel's spiritual champion now gabriel is a great angel he's a mighty angel got a great anointing but it was not him that was able to break through thank god for men of god thank god for every true prophet that's been down through time thank god for every true pastor every songwriter every song leader but let me tell you something we have only had one mighty champion that would be able to look at death that be able to look at the grave hallelujah and say take my life from me and in three days i will raise it up moses couldn't say that john couldn't say that peter couldn't say that brother brown couldn't say that but our champion hallelujah the lord jesus could say hallelujah amen death and hell give way give way you remember when brother branham tells us about the maniac in oregon they come and challenged him and he walked up on the platform threatened to break everyone in his body and all that you remember the child just briefed it but brother baby said what happened was that the chief of that tribe of demons the chief of that tribe of demons made a challenge to the holy ghost and the holy ghost accepted the challenge yes sir now whenever it happened you remember the story that the man laid across his feet and they come and ask him said is he delivered said no he worships that spirit he worships that spirit number other brahman said whenever the spirit of god began to move in there everybody in the building was healed of course except for the man that was the closest to the prophet now this man is laying across his feet and got nothing and there were more my cripples and blind and whatever more and some of them sitting in the back of the auditorium and setting up wherever more but yet whenever faith rose to that spot why that chief of that tribe of demons made a challenge and the holy ghost said i will accept your challenge let me tell you something friend we didn't come here tonight to play games we've got come here tonight to play church if the devil wants to make a challenge our holy ghost will accept it hallelujah our holy ghost will accept his talents if he wants to say we are defeated our holy ghost will say no my bride is not defeated she is more than a conference hallelujah i'm not going to say that and you better not the devil wants to challenge me i tell him to talk to my brother my champion i've got a champion it ain't me it ain't these brothers i love all these brothers i love yeah i love them all but they're not my champion when i was lost i didn't need one of these guys to come and find me i needed a champion if you said you're not battling cancer you don't need just a preacher you need a cancer champion hallelujah if you're bound with something in your life you need a champion glory to god hallelujah notice this in verse 20 of daniel chapter 10 then said he knowest thou wherefore i come unto thee and now will i return to fight i like that grit don't you now he needed help before who who among us don't i will return to fight with the prince of persia and when i am gone forth love the prince of gracia shall come so here we're getting close to where this empire is going to end and another is going to begin not a carry over the same demon but a different demon has been chosen and i will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth there is none that hold us with me in these things but michael your prince hallelujah we all know we have an adversary and we can give him credit for it he is a good one he knows how to fight come on you can say amen to that he's one that has been doing this for thousands of years some of y'all 18 20 25 65 70 whatever you are but you're talking about an adversary that has been doing this for over 6 000 years he knows every he knows every my every trick every deceptive means well you say how in the world could we do it we cannot you say why are you preaching us so weak i want you to realize how weak you are i want you to realize how helpless and how hopeless that we are and let me tell you something it ain't enough to come to a great message church it ain't enough to listen to tapes every now and then and read your bible it ain't enough to be identified well i believe brother branham was a prophet the devil believes the same thing we've got to be born again we've got to have the true baptism of the holy ghost i'm not just talking about something that'll make us shout or make us cry i'm talking about something when hell is broke loose all around you and you cry and you pray and it seems like god won't move that you stand right there and say devil out of my way you're not tying me down you're not stopping me hallelujah greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world you may be greater than me greater than these preachers that you're not greater than my champion my champion jesus christ defeated you read with me in first peter chapter 5 verse 8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour who better than peter to know about the prowess of satan remember him standing up there saying lord if everybody forsakes you i'll go hallelujah our god he didn't want to hear what jesus had to say before the crows you'll deny that you even know him he probably didn't even believe it just like some of you don't she said no the ministry of pro for pastors that love you with all their heart and they keep trying no i'm no i'm good i'm good i'm good you know what god has to let us happen to us sometimes because of our hard-hittedness we have to fall flat on our face several times jesus warned him simon simon satan hath desired that he may have you that he may sift you as sweet but i have prayed for you that your faith will not fail you now peter did but his faith did some of you may have failed god over and over again but the same lord jesus that prayed for peter has prayed for the rest of his brother and his prayers will be answered lord hallelujah he didn't just pray for peter he is your intercessor brother sister [Applause] notice this matthew 26 40 cometh unto the disciples and find them asleep it says unto peter what could you not watch with me one hour watch and pray lest you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak oh how many times did peter remember that later oh why did i do it why did i do it because it wasn't born again he was a preacher turned out to be a cussing preacher praise the lord a naked preacher out there fishing naked i never have understood that what in the world i don't tell what you'll do without the holy ghost well come on that's the bible it's not enough for him to be identified around this message the message must be inside of us it'll keep you when you cannot keep yourself it will pulsate something on the inside of you that emotion boy i love emotion i love anointing i love feeling it from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet but i love it when i've got a tie post in my soul when i can't feel nothing at all and it still ties me to that rock christ jesus the prophet of god said to make your absolute a christ-centered life a christ-centered life [Music] again peter says be sober the word sober ma it's to avoid drunkenness of your senses drunkenness in your souls be sober and vigilant to watch the word sober again means to be calm collected in spirit to govern both the outward and the inward man by rules of temperaments modesty and mortification cares can intoxicate the soul this is where most laodiceans are drunk on the cares of this world but peter says be sober and be vigilant vigilantes watch wait metaphorically give strict attention to be cautious active to take heed lest through remission or carelessness that's why brother brandman said over and over again it's not the great big things that you do some little things that you leave undone now remember who our enemy is these demons these are the same ones that anointed sodom these are the same ones and the andeluvian destruction that god owned the people this is the same ones that moses did with the very talking about experience there's no way we can do this without a champion i don't know about you i'm going to be standing in this last day i want to be one of those that's going to be faithful to the end anybody else i don't want a t-shirt at the end of the way to say i survived laodicea i'm going to be an overcomer i want to be one of the sons of god that's going to overcome in this evil age i'm not just going to survive i believe that a child of god i simply believe what the prophet said that a person can live so close to god that the devil don't know what to do with you can you imagine how it ought to be for every holy ghost field child of god here today that when you get up out of the bed in the morning and you set your feet down on the floor that them demons gonna say lord god here they come oh oh no oh whoa she lived another day he lived another day hallelujah why because we are the god of the people of god we cannot be defeated friends we are made out of stuff that don't bluff hallelujah when you hate to be the type of christian that down in hell whenever your name is mentioned then demons say if people only knew them the way i did and satan said all right it's time for a shift change i want i want this demon away from this house and that one who wants to go over that other house you imagine the demons i will i will but for me i want to be the type of believer whenever a shift change is required for reagan hard i know you've heard it before but when satan says i need somebody to go up to the reagan home then devils go to driving handkerchiefs they're going to grab bath tails and they're going to balding like a rat eating onions i'm telling you what they crying and crying they support you please don't give me your send me up there please don't send me to her house please don't send me to her house that's the kind of testimony hallelujah that we want down in hell that we're not just talkers but we are possessors of this world we're possessors of jesus christ we take our stand hallelujah we will not bow we will not give him we will not compromise [Applause] you see it ain't hard to rejoice in the anointings like this way but next week you ain't feeling it you still want to have the same determination that you got tonight if you're just emotion and you're worked up under everybody else's gift and everybody else's influence won't do much good but when all hell is breaking loose all around you you want to stand right there and say me and my champion will take all of [Applause] oh y'all you'll imagine david said in psalms 27 remember the prophet read that song for a background for the rapture really sometimes you'll understand why david said though a whole host comes against me i will not be afraid imagine david was under him going out in the woods out of the wilderness and he got up one morning going out there stretching you know just woke up got up walked down he looked around on every hillside was an enemy david looked up at him and said you just signed your death lord hallelujah thou a host come against me i will not be afraid for the lord is my life and the strength of my life of whom shall i fear yes we're not afraid of death disease we're not afraid of it oh no hell no our champion conquered all glory to god peter described him this way and said be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil and the word adversary literally means your opponent in a court of justice your opponent in a court of justice why you think the bible calls him an accuser of the brethren and the lord knows that we give him enough evidence against us come on i don't sit there and look like you i didn't see no angel wings racks hanging out there for you folks to hang up your angel wings you're like all the rest of us you're immortal you got your weaknesses your failures your shortcomings a lot of us did the devil don't have to make up anything all he's got to do just see what he sees every day well come on now so what does he do he's our adversary and this is what peter addressed it and said no my because your adversary the devil we should constantly be alert that diablos this is what the word satan and the greek is diablos slanderer slanderer is always actively seeking an opportunity to bring a charge against you notice how peter describes it he says as a roaring lion now he doesn't say that he is one but he's has one which means he's an impersonator remember the bow with no errors as a ring why would he want to be that way because god of course is as a lion so here the enemy wants to impersonate himself as a roaring lion so called because of the account of his strengths and tenacity by which he challenges us that's one thing we've got to give him credit for us preachers tear the heart off of him if we blasted you one-third as much as we blast the devil some of you would never come back we call him a liar we blast him to his face we cast him out every time we get a chance we say he's going to hell we say he's evil and he's rotten he's the most faithful member i've got and the most faithful member here as well he comes every service he ain't good for nothing he don't pay no ties he don't help take up the you know just to take up the slack he's really good for nothing but he's here all the time if you were treated that way you'd be so discouraged you'd never come back but he keeps on coming back we knock him down he gets up we knock him down he gets up but we're gonna have the last knock and he won't get back up hallelujah hallelujah i as a roaring lion notice peter doesn't say he's a sleeping man not lying sleep about 20 hours a day i'm talking about in a while about 20 hours a day so they don't really do a whole lot now we know that the lion is the king we know all that but yet in reality he's a pretty sorry outfit i'm talking about the male he doesn't do most of the killing the females doing the pride and then whenever he hears something dying you know carrying on that he'll come over there and take the kill away from them yeah look at satan in his church and you say it's exactly the way he is he takes the kill away from them and then he eats till he's full and then he'll give whatever's left to the rest of the lionesses and the cubs and yet peter likened him so he's not a sleeping lion or a lion that's just laying back and doing this thing and you know whenever a lion is not really hungry they will go i've been to the to the africa several times and across the plains of the serengeti and it's amazing where the cheetah with the leopard within the big cats whenever they're going across the plains of the serengeti wherever they are and they've got their tail bent back over their back like this there can be impala wildebeest all kinds of animals out there and they'll wash them they'll keep their eye on them but they're not afraid of them you know why it's a sign they're not hunting they're not hunting but whenever they're hunting they won't see them now this is the way he does you so you're looking for this great big old guy with this big old mane and these big old paws uh-uh that ain't the way he's going to get you he's going to be hiding he's going to be watching for your weakness watching for this and watching for that several years ago i was in the messiah morrow a gigantic game park there in kenya one of the brothers in the message that was there and he took us out and i saw a very strange thing it was a female lioness and she was laying up upon an ant mound and it was maybe about this high something like that right out in the plane open so that was jim's butt that was impala uh willoughby scooted just all kinds of different animals and i thought it was so odd and so unusual that she was laying right out there in the open so i said brother why is is she laying there he said she is a decoy i said a decoy said yeah he said let me let me look so he started looking looking looking and he found the rest of the pride and they were coming through the tall grass so all the impala all the rest of the animals had their eyes on the decoy and the others were moving up all around them well come on now children come on now oh we're scared to death of communism and we're scared to death of this and that and the other that ain't nothing but a decoy the prophet told us whenever he was here oh it ain't that iron curtain it's that purple one come on now even this message folks have got our eyes off of that purple one seems right but that's the one we need to be watching what is this other stuff that ain't nothing but a decoy satan will put decoys in your life and you're looking you're scared to death of that and you're scared to death of that and the very thing you ought to be aware of is moving right up behind you and it's trying to steal your children it's time to steal your joy it's time to steal the walk with god oh hallelujah but we need to realize our champion has given us power we are lying killers oh grower we are lying killers my wife and i carol sitting here was in johannesburg several years ago and the brother there wanted to do us a really nice treat so we got in at night it was late when we got there we drove and drove and drove we're taking us to the place where we're going to stay we didn't know where it was so we checked into a place look kind of primitive we checked in we got into this place and it was a thatched type roof so we didn't know exactly where we were but maybe two three o'clock in the morning something started going i don't mind telling you that little wife of mine was glued to me has there been anybody else in the bed i've been glued to them probably because it was so scary now what you've seen in the atlanta zoo and what you've seen in those three reports you forget it that's not a real specimen of the lie and the way people want to paint the devil to you is some little weakling something no he is a real devil he is a prince but we've got power over him hallelujah we've got power young people you cannot meet him on your own but with jesus inside of you there is no temptation there is no rust there is no pornography there is no sin that can defeat you and hold your life unless you allow it to the problem was the brother had put us in a game park but carol and i didn't know that there was a big fence right on the outside of our room it sounded like the line was in the next one to us oh my on and on and on he went the next morning we were awakened by monkeys on the roof so then i get up i'm gonna go outside and just right there is this fence but it's 15 20 feet tall i thought if i don't know that i could have slept like a baby why he couldn't get to me [Applause] oh he'll roar and he'll roar and he'll scare you and he'll scare you but brother sister you can sleep like a baby lord of god you are sealed by the holy ghost and that devil cannot get you if you're sealed in god oh my god notice david in psalms 17 12 said locke as a lion that is greedy of his prey and he said we're a young lion lurking in secret places you see the lion does not roar when he hunts he only roars when he's in attack mode now he'll be so close or the females and when they get so close then is when they'll make the noise everything else is stealth mode you don't even know it no that's on you but if you got the holy ghost you got a built-in buzzer [Music] it gives you a warning something ain't right something how many knows what i'm talking about aren't you glad for the holy ghost that has warned you time and time and time again thank god for the blood when we mess up but thank god for the holy ghost that stops us from messing up before we ever mess up i think that teaches us the tactics of our enemies watch this peter goes on to say so be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil is a roaring lion walk us about seeking whom he may devour remember in the book of job chapter 1 verse 7 the lord said unto satan once cometh now then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it what's he hunting for pray let me tell you something whether you're young or old here tonight there is nothing he's more proud of than a trophy on his wall of a young man or a young woman that said in a message church or an older man or older woman who said in a message church oh i've got many trophies i've been able to hunt in different parts of the world and every one of them has a story yeah every one of them's got a story well that one there that's a fallow deer it run me up a tree up in north carolina truth run me up a tree and it was i dropped my gun going up the tree and the deer was down at the bottom of the of the tree chewing on my strap and i thought lucky me he'll probably shoot me out of the tree so nearly every one of them have a story but can you imagine on satan's den room wall oh yeah let's see that in there that's a pastor's daughter see that in there she was born and raised in church look at that one oh remember him in center part and shout and jump around glory to god hallelujah now they don't even think there's a god why not sealed the champion the champion look for the champion is not your knowledge of the message the champion is not your ability to quote the word please don't misunderstand me your champion is not even your pastor you must have an individual walk with god you must have a sore a christ-centered life that you if your pastor's overseas and you can't reach your mama but you've got to walk with god and you say satan out of my way out of my way in the name of jesus hallelujah greater is he that is in me than you [Applause] so this is what he's doing he's going around looking for people that he can devour oh how many has he swallowed down the greek word here literally means drink down drink down so he takes the lid off of their life and empties their holiness their purity their testimony and it just swallows it down for me i want to be a porcupine christian can you imagine a lion trying to swallow a whole basket full of toothpicks now it does not say that he can devour everybody oh glory to god i'm not responsible from this point on to the rest of the service okay so if mayhem breaks out it's your fault it amen can you imagine there are a group of people on the face of the earth tonight they have been through hell they have been through sickness they have been through disease they fought through cancer they fought through disappointment they have fought through so much tough and the devil thought i'll get him with this or i'll get him without or i'll get him with something else oh hallelujah but there are a group of people on the face of the earth tonight that satan cannot devour hallelujah he cannot devour them they are not edible glory of course they are not edible hallelujah glory be to god glory to god he watches you he eyes you to see are you edible he wants to swallow you you ever seen the little cartoon of the big bird out in the pond he's trying to swallow the frog and the little frog's got his front arms right around the neck hold on to the last minute how many of us have been there before and we saw i'm a goner sure as a world no you're not a goner why because you're made out of stuff that cannot be defeated i'm not talking about naturally i'm talking about our soul look friend we are of the family of god our brother noah built an ark our brother moses led the children of israel to the promised land hallelujah our brother daniel went into the lion's den i'd rather shut that knee sacked at have been ago you could not burn him in the fire the lion said i'll get him and the son of god said no you won't no i'll go down down in that fiery furnace [Music] you are not swallowable remember death is swallowed up in victory gas is swallowed up and satan's kingdom is yes his kingdom is death dance cannot swaddle up life he's looking and looking for whom he may gulp is another one of the words there gulp don't you want to be so full of the holy ghost [Applause] that if he just starts taking the lid off of your bottle you say [Music] [Applause] better leave that old boy alone better leave that young woman alone i can't drink her i can't swallow him he's still full of the power of god hallelujah i cannot go put him down oh notice this brother bim said a lion is a fierce animal an africable is hunting them a lion can kill 10 men before you can say jack robinson now what that means i don't have a clue but all i know is it can kill 10 men faster than you can say jack robinson powerful great beast just like a big roar and men are consuming the one who dies under the power of a lion never feels any hurt it's such a scare to hear that roar that he gives those great mammoth feet just in a second he's tore down a dozen men we don't want to get worked up in this meeting with just work up alone we want some equipment oh yeah we want to work up that's right going to have a couple more minutes satan temps under three forms the subtle serpent to beguile our senses pervert our judgment and enchant our imagination remember every day of your life you got 10 gates against you right imagination conscience memory reason and affection see taste feel smelling here you got 10 gates against one your soul as an angel of light to deceive with false views even of spiritual things so he comes as a subtle serpent or as an angel of light or a line if he can't talk you into something he'll try to scare you into something well so and so fell and they were closer to god than you are they were a much better person than you are look i'm not making so and so my example come on now you know as well as i do that satan will do that to everyone well look at yourself so and so did this so and so well if you keep your eyes on so and so you may wind up like so and so but i want to tell you today there's one that we can put our eyes on as our example and that's the lord jesus don't make no man no ma'am you're heavenly example there's only one let me set this i hope you don't understand it i put my ultimate complete confidence in no individual no man i don't care how good they are they are still human beings come on don't get quiet on me there's one being that i put my ultimate trust my ultimate confidence my ultimate faith in and that's the lord jesus christ well praise the lord why because he is not only the mighty conqueror whenever daniel was needing an answer from the lord and gabriel couldn't bring it to it who knows how many other angels were there involved and they didn't know what to do but what happened a mighty one came down the covenant angel hallelujah he came down and strengthened gabriel and he was able to come why because he was the champion of israel let me tell you something we were in a worse dilemma we were born lost with a sinful nature out of the economy of god far from the commonwealth of god it seemed we were helpless and hopeless we were lost without god most of us weren't even seeking god we didn't want god we didn't want church we didn't want no bible but it wasn't that you wanted god it's that god wanted you [Applause] oh my you say well i just can't take it no more i think i'm gonna quit tell me this how can you stop something you never started you never started your salvation you never started your eternal life you never started your election but god started you before the foundation of the world before there was ever a moon or a star or a sun you were in his mind you were part of this bride before the world began and let satan roar let him do what he's going to do that we are undeceivable we are the army of the living god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah many of you no doubt have heard the stories of the lines of darkness that was going to build a bridge in africa in the 1900s this particular line they kept trying to trap it trying to kill it they just couldn't do it then another one would come these wines were so savage they would come in and pull servants out out of the tents at night it was unbelievable then this line set its goal on this one particular man an engineer or bridge builder it was almost as if they were demonic anointed they hunted and they hunted got up in a tree done all sorts of things to try to find it finally they found a lair or a den when they got in there they found skulls of humans they found feet bones they found hand bones they found all kinds of things and satan loves to scare you and i with such things look at so-and-so so-and-so zones i've done this so-and-so done that so-and-so done that yeah he wants to show you all them bones of how the mighty have fallen oh look at that they're so-and-so's carcass i destroyed him you better be so-and-so look friend satan won't care at all if you and i just become church members he did not want the son of god to go to calvary he said i'll give you all the kingdoms of the world just don't die that's exactly what he'll offer you and i just be a message church member just come to a good message church and live a pretty good sort of a lie but don't go to calvary because that's the only thing that will change our nature and make us to where satan cannot get to us or he'll huff and he'll puff and he'll say he'll blow your house down but he'll blow himself down before he'll blow the house of the brown hallelujah are we going to be standing what about you oh yeah me and my mama no you if there's not but one person out of this assembly here tonight going i hate to inform all of you but y'all better move outside the building because it's me it's you is it you is it you you need to have that revelation sorry brother donnie it's me i've got my ticket in my hand i've got the token over my soul hallelujah satan cannot stop me i'm part of the economy you say how can you say that well it's just a little simple story really go with me for a few moments can see the body laying there in the tomb it was cold and lifeless it happened so quickly they couldn't even anoint it with the spices and the myrrh but the soul was in another world and he goes down and he preaches to the souls that are in prison then he knocks on the door of hell satan comes to the door gotcha i thought i had you when i got able i knew for sure when i got moses it comes on down the line but now i've got you prophet said he reached inside there and grabbed the keys off his side hallelujah hallelujah and he kept that door of hell shut and the prophet said everything on the wall so far [Applause] hallelujah now the real life the lion of the crime of judah tells the devil you are [Applause] the real lions stand up will the real lion's wife stand up the victors in this age not survivors [Applause] it goes over next into the next realm to paradise abraham goes to the door sarah [Music] here comes sarah here comes job here come ezekiel see who said it's that wheel in the middle of the window that is your champion oh you said that ah ah forget you point the devil to your champion your sickness point your disease to your second home for your temptation to your champion oh yes you're bigger than me you're stronger than me but nobody's greater than my champion he conquered all [Music] and yet paul says when the resurrection takes place for the bride the dead and christ rest first and those of us that are alive of course and remain will be changed paul goes on to say there in corinthians then shall be brought to pass this thing death is swallowed up in victory well you mean the lord jesus didn't fulfill that he left that for you i wonder how many times the lord jesus passed that man there by the gate beautiful he went right but that way no telling how many times you imagine him passing them out one day i'm going to leave that for the boys [Music] he could have healed everybody in jerusalem they said no i'm going to leave that for my youngest amen he could have absolutely annihilated every devil that he said i want to leave some of them to my daughters i'm going to leave some of them for my sons i'm going to leave some of them for my preachers they're gonna preach the devil out of people it will cast the devil out of people it'll be me and brian [Applause] i know i know it sounds crazy but can you imagine me and carol go home a couple days and y'all hear the news a robber broke into our house and then you hear this phenomenal story a robber broke into brother donnie and sister carol's house and from what i hear brother donny told sister carol honey go deal with him i mean have you seen her she's a little bitty small woman they say oh oh my goodness that is a half of it from what i hear she got in there and she went yeah they tell me the robber called the police himself please come and get me oh children if you only understood it satan wants to make you afraid of him but the truth of it is he's afraid of you hallelujah every devil out of hell is scared to death for the sons of god and the daughters of god because they are only make-believe we [Music] [Applause] oh my gosh where is [Applause] if he's delivered you praise him ain't nobody like my dreams [Applause] [Music] don't just let your hands worse [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] holds you
