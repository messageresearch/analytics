[39:17] scripture this morning to the Book of
[39:20] Daniel chapter 12 I really feel drawn to
[39:23] this passage of Scripture today once
[39:27] more I want to read it again Daniel
[39:29] chapter 12 and verse 1 and at that time
[39:33] shall Michael stand up the Great Prince
[39:37] which standeth for the children of thy
[39:39] people and there shall be a time of
[39:41] trouble such as never was since there
[39:45] was a nation even to that
[39:47] same time or at that and at that time
[39:50] thy people shall be delivered every one
[39:52] that shall be found written in the book
[39:55] and many of them that sleep in the dust
[39:57] of the earth shall awake some to
[39:59] everlasting life and some to shame and
[40:01] everlasting contempt and they that be
[40:04] wise shall shine as the brightness of
[40:08] the firmament and they that turn many to
[40:10] righteousness as and stars forever and
[40:13] ever but Thou O Daniel shut up the words
[40:16] and seal the book even to the time of
[40:19] the end many shall run to and fro and
[40:22] knowledge shall be increased then I
[40:25] would look into the book of Revelation
[40:27] chapter 12 also this is this is a
[40:33] parallel to the book of daniel booko
[40:36] Daniel was the book of Revelation to the
[40:39] Jewish people and of course to us as the
[40:42] in the Gentile dispensation where God
[40:45] has called in a people for his namesake
[40:48] the book of Revelation it's very
[40:50] pertinent to us in this hour Daniel
[40:52] revelation 12 verse 7 and there was war
[40:55] in heaven Michael and his angels fought
[40:58] against the Dragon and the dragon fought
[41:01] and his angels and prevailed not neither
[41:04] was their place found any more in heaven
[41:07] and the Great Dragon was cast out that
[41:10] old serpent called the devil and Satan
[41:14] which deceiveth the whole world he was
[41:16] cast out into the earth and his angels
[41:18] were cast out with him and then for
[41:21] another scripture reading we'll read
[41:23] from 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 and verse
[41:27] 18 and this is where we're going to draw
[41:30] our text from this morning while we look
[41:34] not at the things which are seen but at
[41:37] the things which are not seen for the
[41:41] things which are seen are temporal but
[41:44] the things which are not seen are
[41:46] eternal
[41:48] a man may God bless you you can be
[41:50] seated ask God's blessings upon his word
[41:53] today and made you be blessed in his
[41:56] presence as we welcome you in his name
[41:59] today is a very special day and we have
[42:04] brother Joe Adams and his family here
[42:07] today we heard sister Jessica sing but
[42:10] their two youngest children are going to
[42:11] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[42:14] Jesus today and as I told you as this
[42:17] began to be very conscience of the
[42:20] little children and their fears and
[42:22] their worries and I think of course you
[42:25] know when we follow the Lord with all
[42:26] our hearts and and follow him and as the
[42:31] scripture tells us to do in water
[42:33] baptism he that believeth and is
[42:35] baptized shall be saved he that
[42:37] believeth not shall be damned the Bible
[42:39] says so we're glad that they're going to
[42:42] obey the Lord in water baptism today and
[42:45] and so we're just looking forward to
[42:47] that when brother Joe will baptize them
[42:49] at the end of the service but today
[42:52] we're going to be speaking on the battle
[42:56] in the unseen realms we know we're
[43:00] looking at the news everywhere and where
[43:05] there is a there is a virus that is
[43:10] going to the land and it's caused a lot
[43:13] of fear a lot of worry a lot of fretting
[43:16] a lot of concern there is upheaval in
[43:20] our governments in our stock markets in
[43:23] our monetary system in our communities
[43:26] so everywhere that we look there's fear
[43:30] everywhere their governments that are
[43:33] trying to act to contain this and so
[43:36] we're looking at the news about this
[43:38] virus and I just want to call what it is
[43:41] when Jesus had rest sickness and
[43:44] diseases he addressed them as demons so
[43:48] these are supernatural devils going to
[43:51] the land Satan has found an opportunity
[43:53] to wreak havoc here in this end time and
[43:57] of course it hasn't caught God by
[44:00] surprise God knows exactly about what is
[44:03] going on and he is conscience of it at
[44:06] this moment and he is at work on our
[44:09] behalf I believe that with all of my
[44:11] heart
[44:11] but of course as he spirits are going to
[44:15] the land they are they are fallen angels
[44:18] they are angels but their fallen angels
[44:21] their angels of death and Jesus called
[44:23] him six sickness devils and of course
[44:27] when they come into a land into a
[44:31] community into world it brings a time of
[44:34] trouble but there is a great Prince
[44:37] which standeth in the time of conflict
[44:40] for the children of thy people so you
[44:44] see the this is not the only demon in
[44:47] the land but but I want you to look away
[44:50] from the bad news to the good news of
[44:54] revelation 10 where he said and I saw
[44:57] another mighty angel and so we're going
[45:00] to be talking about the battle that is
[45:03] now going on in the heavenly realms as
[45:07] we look from the scene into the unseen
[45:11] in both the Book of Daniel and the book
[45:14] of Revelation Michael is shown that as a
[45:17] messenger of war and he fights through
[45:20] the darkness against the Prince of
[45:23] Persia to bring a message to Daniel it
[45:27] was a time where prophecy was being
[45:30] fulfilled the 70 years of captivity down
[45:34] in Babylon had been um come come to an
[45:38] end and Daniel was praying and
[45:40] concerning you know when was it time to
[45:43] go home
[45:44] and I think that is part of our prayer
[45:47] today as we are considering this you
[45:49] know when is it time to go home we have
[45:52] been looking far throughout the
[45:54] thousands of years now for Jesus to come
[45:57] back and certainly he will come and he
[46:00] will come when every name in the book of
[46:03] life has been manifested on earth
[46:05] because he knows exactly which ones of
[46:08] us must be here in that name dipped in
[46:11] blood and then the rapture will take
[46:13] place but in the book of Revelation it
[46:17] shows um Michael prevailing against
[46:22] Lucifer and his angels
[46:24] in the book of Daniel it shows him
[46:27] standing up and he fights here at Daniel
[46:32] chapter 12 gives us fascinating account
[46:35] of Gabriel and Archangel of God who has
[46:38] been hindered for twenty-one days
[46:40] because of the Prince of Persia and then
[46:43] Michael comes to assist Gabriel and he
[46:46] got through to Daniel to reveal to him
[46:48] his day his hour and to give him the
[46:51] word of his restoration and the restored
[46:56] of Israel back to their homeland
[46:58] last Sunday I ended with these
[47:01] scriptures and again I would like to
[47:04] bring them to your attention as part of
[47:06] the foundation of this part of the
[47:09] service because I'm convinced that this
[47:12] battle that we are in that is affecting
[47:15] the world today is because of things
[47:19] that are happening in the unseen round
[47:22] of course we see what is it can be seen
[47:26] in the scene right but we want to look
[47:29] away from that and and try to get a
[47:31] glimpse of what is happening in the
[47:33] unseen realm and the Bible said
[47:37] concerning angels in Hebrews chapter
[47:39] 1:14 are not all angels ministering
[47:43] spirits sent to serve those who inherit
[47:47] salvation so all true angels are
[47:50] ministering spirits again Matthew 18 10
[47:55] said see that you despise not one of
[47:57] these little ones for I say unto you the
[48:00] angels in heaven continually see the
[48:04] face of my father who is in heaven and
[48:07] then some 34 and 7 the angel of the lord
[48:10] encamps about around those who fear him
[48:15] and he delivers them and then sums 9111
[48:19] for he will give his angels charge
[48:21] concerning you to guard you in all your
[48:26] ways these are wonderful scriptures in
[48:28] Exodus 23 and 20 see I'm sending an
[48:32] angel ahead of you to guard you along
[48:34] the way to bring you to the place which
[48:37] I have prepared so you see I want you to
[48:43] think about the end the angels of God
[48:47] that in camp around about those that
[48:51] fear him and that believe him and and I
[48:54] want to remind you that there is an
[48:56] angel that accompanies this endtime
[48:59] message in this last day now I'm gonna
[49:02] spend some time today
[49:04] I'll be talking about an angelic
[49:06] visitation that happened in 1946 that
[49:10] started the great divine healing
[49:13] movement and out of their coma came all
[49:16] Robertson and Jack Coe and different
[49:19] ones that caught the inspiration because
[49:21] the angel of the Lord came to a prophet
[49:26] of God William Branham and I just want
[49:29] to say there's no message that has been
[49:31] vindicated by an angel like this message
[49:34] you know Jack Cole had blind faith our
[49:37] he would many times take people's of
[49:40] glasses and with an anvil and a hammer
[49:43] and beat them together and him pray for
[49:45] them and expect healing and take credit
[49:48] braces off of a child and and command
[49:52] the devil to leave yeah blind faith or
[49:55] Roberts to do that told his audience to
[49:58] imagine Jesus as a man standing right
[50:01] here and and while that I am praying for
[50:04] you that Jesus is laying his hands upon
[50:07] you and and you know again that was
[50:11] wonderful and many people believed that
[50:13] were healed but but this but this man
[50:18] William Branham had a visible presence
[50:20] of an angel many actually saw the angel
[50:25] or the light that surrounded his
[50:27] presence and those who who didn't were
[50:31] like me when I was just a young boy and
[50:33] I said in his meaning in life Tabernacle
[50:36] in Shreveport Louisiana I didn't see the
[50:39] angel now I neither did I see the light
[50:41] but I saw it as you see the wind and I
[50:45] explained it this way is when you look
[50:48] outside
[50:48] maybe you
[50:49] even feel the wind but you see the trees
[50:52] blowing are you here
[50:54] sometimes the whistle of the land as it
[50:57] comes through the cracks the crevices
[50:59] and makes its noise or whatever moving
[51:03] through the trees and and and so again I
[51:08] didn't see the angel but I saw his
[51:10] effects and you couldn't tell me all the
[51:13] wind isn't blowing oh no I see all the
[51:16] trees moving in the grass move and I
[51:18] hear the sound thereof and and again you
[51:22] couldn't convince me the angel of God
[51:24] wasn't there because it discerned the
[51:27] thoughts the intents of the heart told
[51:29] people who they were what her name was
[51:32] where they came from what their diseases
[51:34] was well you know about how many times
[51:38] they had been to the doctor visit
[51:41] incredible things and I want you to know
[51:44] it was never wrong and it wasn't an 80%
[51:48] prophesy and 20% miss it was 100 percent
[51:52] every time
[51:53] never missed now you know I would like
[51:57] just to share with you just a moment as
[51:59] a reminder about this visitation where
[52:05] that William Branham met the angel of
[52:08] God of course he had heard his voice
[52:11] since a child but it was at the age of
[52:15] 37 years of age when after being told
[52:19] over and over about the clergy and
[52:21] fellow ministers that God didn't heal no
[52:25] more for the days of miracles was passed
[52:28] and as his gift of visions were just the
[52:31] devil that he made an attempt to one day
[52:35] to ask God to just deliver him because
[52:39] of all what the clergymen and the
[52:42] preachers and religious men we call
[52:44] calling it the devil and so he went to
[52:46] an old cabin in the woods telling God I
[52:50] want nothing to do with these visions I
[52:52] want nothing to do with with these
[52:56] experiences that I'm having but they're
[52:58] about
[52:59] midnight when he was having a showdown
[53:02] with God on May the 7th 1946 the pillar
[53:06] of fire came into the cabin word that he
[53:09] was praying there out of out of a light
[53:13] stepped a man six foot tall 200 pounds
[53:17] an olive complexion with hair to his
[53:20] shoulders and and in his word I would
[53:24] just like to share with you his words
[53:27] today as he recounts the story he says
[53:30] now in the world of visions this man was
[53:32] not a vision he walked up to me I heard
[53:36] his feet as he walked he walked up to me
[53:39] and spoke and I was shaking like this
[53:41] and he said do not fear and when he said
[53:44] that that was the same voice I've heard
[53:48] since I was a baby the same man but now
[53:51] he was in a man that I've seen him a
[53:54] cloud and a pillar I heard him in a
[53:56] whirlwind in the bush talking to me but
[53:58] I'd never seen him as a man and here he
[54:01] was as a man you said I'm sent from the
[54:04] presence of Almighty God to tell you
[54:07] that your peculiar life and birth was
[54:10] for you to go to the world and pray for
[54:12] the sick people said your ministry will
[54:15] scatter all over the world and then this
[54:17] will bring the gospel and the power
[54:19] which will bring the second coming of
[54:22] Christ what you don't think of this I am
[54:26] mad because I want to remind you again
[54:27] the words of this angel has never failed
[54:31] and this was to bring the gospel and the
[54:35] power which will bring the second coming
[54:39] of Christ what a promise that is as we
[54:42] look at a very dark in time when the
[54:46] looming clouds of tribulation are
[54:48] getting closer and closer and drawing
[54:50] near and we we hear the lightning and we
[54:53] can even feel some of the breeze that
[54:55] has been and the winds of change that
[54:58] are beginning to happen all around us
[55:00] and in sicknesses that have been have
[55:04] been bred up and came and and moved in
[55:07] the heads
[55:07] not an opportunity in pre-tribulation
[55:10] plagues being poured out upon the world
[55:13] it's comforting to know that he made a
[55:17] promise he will not leave us in this in
[55:19] time but he'll rapture of people out
[55:22] before the great plagues come upon the
[55:25] earth I was reading in in a book that
[55:31] that made up all of this counts by it's
[55:34] called a supernatural by on owen
[55:37] jorgeson and he paraphrase it like this
[55:40] as he gave this same account of what the
[55:43] angel said you will give be given to
[55:46] science first you will take a person's
[55:49] right hand in your left hand and you'll
[55:51] be able to detect the presence of any
[55:53] germ cause disease by vibrations that
[55:57] will appear in your left hand then you
[55:59] must pray for the person if your hand
[56:01] returns to normal you can pronounce the
[56:04] person healed if it doesn't just ask a
[56:08] blessing and walk away
[56:10] under the anointing from God do not try
[56:12] to take your own thoughts but it'll give
[56:15] you be giving you what to say but he
[56:18] said he asked but what if they still
[56:21] don't believe me
[56:22] he saw the second sign is going to be
[56:24] greater than the first if you'll stay
[56:26] humble and sincere it will come to pass
[56:29] that you will be able to tell by vision
[56:31] the very secrets of their hearts then
[56:35] the people will have to believe you now
[56:37] listen this will initiate the gospel in
[56:40] power that will bring on the second
[56:43] coming of Christ notice this says
[56:46] initiation this will start it'll begin
[56:49] people to believing Amanda and this is
[56:54] what we need in this hour more than ever
[56:57] we need people with faith with people to
[57:01] believe a man that you know where we're
[57:03] coming into a time and a day and in the
[57:06] moment it may not be that the pastor can
[57:09] come in and lay hands on you you may be
[57:12] an isolated ward or and impossible for
[57:16] somebody even loved ones and close
[57:18] friends to even get to you we don't
[57:21] know the conditions that will be but I
[57:23] want you to know God's Word never fails
[57:26] a man in Jesus is always present and in
[57:31] the days of Jesus it didn't take a
[57:33] physical laying on her hands though he
[57:35] did that many times for gyruss did you
[57:39] said come and lay hands on my daughter
[57:40] but for the Gentile the Centurion said I
[57:44] recognize you as a man of authority and
[57:48] just as I say to to this one you know go
[57:52] and he goes and does it man and those
[57:54] that are under me you go do this and
[57:56] they do it he said so I recognized
[57:59] demons and evil spirits are under your
[58:02] authority you don't have to come to my
[58:04] house you just speak the word and my
[58:06] servant will live hey man so you see
[58:10] we're we're in that cycle of time right
[58:14] now today how long we'll be there I
[58:16] don't know but I guarantee you one thing
[58:19] we're in a moment in a time where faith
[58:21] has not got to be something just talked
[58:24] about
[58:24] it's got to be practice the angel said
[58:28] never forget and this is something I
[58:30] want to remind you of today never forget
[58:33] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[58:36] today and forever as the scripture has
[58:40] declared it will not be you who
[58:42] accompanies any of this it will be the
[58:46] Lord Jesus Christ remember jesus
[58:49] promises followers he that believeth on
[58:52] me the works that I do shall he do also
[58:54] and greater than these shall he do
[58:56] because I go to my father yet a little
[58:59] war while the world seeth me no more but
[59:01] you see me because I live you shall live
[59:04] also and that that day you shall know
[59:06] that I am in my father and ye and me and
[59:10] I in you so these are the words of the
[59:14] angel and then he he finishes up by
[59:17] saying I'll be with you and I want you
[59:21] to know it's not just a man that he was
[59:23] with it's his word that he is with and
[59:27] if he's with his word and you're a
[59:30] believer in that word he's with that
[59:32] word
[59:32] today remember and as we think about
[59:36] this angel said I'll be with you and
[59:38] with him he was the sick were healed the
[59:42] lame walked diseases were discerned
[59:44] blind eyes was open I just listened to a
[59:48] couple of the the discernment lines that
[59:52] you can listen to on on the message hub
[59:55] and and then click on audio and it'll
[59:58] list them out where someone is has made
[1:00:00] a whole collection of the many
[1:00:04] discernment lines about eight eight
[1:00:06] tapes of it or or sermons of it and and
[1:00:10] there you know on there you can hear
[1:00:13] people who who will speak up and saying
[1:00:15] I can have here I on another I can see
[1:00:19] yes I can see you I see your nose or
[1:00:22] them lights and all these things that
[1:00:24] are happening right there in the prayer
[1:00:27] lines let me tell you it happened
[1:00:29] but that's not a passage God we serve a
[1:00:33] present tense God and it should be of no
[1:00:37] doubt to us today that the same angel of
[1:00:40] God who is there to anoint and bring
[1:00:43] healing if still here in the church
[1:00:46] today because Jesus has to be the same
[1:00:50] yesterday today and forever a man and
[1:00:55] brother branham was speaker that pillar
[1:00:56] of fire that would often he would see
[1:00:59] that light and then it would hang over a
[1:01:01] person and show a vision and he says to
[1:01:04] my opinion it's the same angel of God
[1:01:07] that followed the children of Israel
[1:01:09] from Egypt under Palestine you know as a
[1:01:12] scholar yourself that was the angel of
[1:01:15] the covenant none other than the Lord
[1:01:17] Jesus Christ of course it was him in pre
[1:01:20] free um incarnate form but Merritt
[1:01:24] nevertheless you know there are things
[1:01:27] that are going on in the unseen realm
[1:01:33] there is a babble of all battles that
[1:01:37] has begun John G Lake he was an early
[1:01:41] Pentecostal father he was called a
[1:01:45] prophet to sow that
[1:01:46] he was an apostle rather to South Africa
[1:01:50] he he prophesied these words he said I
[1:01:55] can see as my spirit discerns of future
[1:01:58] and reaches out to touch the heart of
[1:02:01] mankind and to desire of God that there
[1:02:04] is coming from heaven a new
[1:02:07] manifestation of the Holy Spirit and
[1:02:09] power and that new manifestation will be
[1:02:12] in sweetness in love in tenderness and
[1:02:16] in the power of the Spirit beyond
[1:02:19] anything your heart or mind ever saw the
[1:02:23] lightning of God will flash through
[1:02:25] men's souls and the sons of God will
[1:02:28] meet the sons of darkness and prevail
[1:02:32] I believe we're living in that day in
[1:02:35] that time that johnsy lake was
[1:02:37] foretelling not brother Branham would
[1:02:40] say something very similar to that he
[1:02:42] said I believe we're on the borderline
[1:02:44] he said I was wondering about my
[1:02:47] meetings and things how I had to cancel
[1:02:49] them out he said I truly believe before
[1:02:52] the church can have the rapture it's
[1:02:55] gotta have rapture and faith we came
[1:02:57] even out faith for divine healing let
[1:03:00] alone rapture in faith we've got our
[1:03:02] faith and a change and quick in this
[1:03:04] body and be taken away and I believe
[1:03:08] there's a church on its Road tonight a
[1:03:10] power of the Living God that men will
[1:03:13] speak the word here and there and it'll
[1:03:16] flash like lightning and the church is
[1:03:19] coming out not a psychologist not some
[1:03:22] of this put on or make belief but a real
[1:03:26] true genuine anointing Holy Ghost called
[1:03:30] out Church and man now again he would he
[1:03:35] would mention this and he would say now
[1:03:37] this may choke you to death but did you
[1:03:40] know that men that are sons of God are
[1:03:43] amateur gods how many ever knew that how
[1:03:47] many know Jesus said so well that's John
[1:03:50] 10 you know that the Bible did not your
[1:03:52] laws say that you are gods and you have
[1:03:55] you call them gods which God said
[1:03:58] - they were God's because they were
[1:04:00] given a full domain over the Dominion of
[1:04:03] the world and he gave him dominion over
[1:04:05] all things and he lost his God ship he
[1:04:09] lost his sonship he lost his domain and
[1:04:12] Satan took it over
[1:04:14] but brother we're waiting for the
[1:04:16] manifestations of the sons of God
[1:04:18] who will come back and take it over
[1:04:20] again waiting for the fullness of time
[1:04:23] when the pyramid gets up to the top and
[1:04:25] he's just using that as an example like
[1:04:28] a pyramid coming starting out a wide and
[1:04:31] coming up to the top there and they're
[1:04:33] waiting for the fullness of the time
[1:04:35] when it gets up to the top when the full
[1:04:38] sons of God will be manifested when the
[1:04:41] power of God will walk out hallelujah
[1:04:43] and we'll take every power that Satan
[1:04:46] has got away from him
[1:04:49] hey man my that oughta produced
[1:04:52] something in our hearts today amen to
[1:04:55] have a consolation God's not gonna leave
[1:04:58] us in this hour alone and powerless and
[1:05:01] weak and unable to conquer a man now we
[1:05:07] we know brother branham show time after
[1:05:11] time that when something climatic is
[1:05:13] going on in the earth it's a sign that
[1:05:16] something is happening in the heavens so
[1:05:20] we look around and we can see something
[1:05:21] very climatic something we have never
[1:05:24] seen before
[1:05:25] quite in this manner right amen but it's
[1:05:29] a sign that there's something that is
[1:05:32] happening in heaven you're seeing things
[1:05:35] that are happening in the scene Ram we
[1:05:37] want to understand there's things that
[1:05:39] are happening in the unseen Ram so we
[1:05:42] got to just turn our camera upward to
[1:05:45] what we can see what he's doing I like
[1:05:48] to share this little quotation from him
[1:05:50] he said he said what thinking of Christ
[1:05:53] and then he got up to the edge with a
[1:05:55] three Hubert children we're about to
[1:05:58] jump over into the fiery furnace and
[1:06:00] they're about the darkest hour they had
[1:06:03] ever seen it coming up to this fiery
[1:06:06] furnace and just about the time they got
[1:06:08] ready to stop here
[1:06:10] step in let's turn our cameras this
[1:06:13] morning and look up to the heaven yonder
[1:06:15] and break out of this dimension and look
[1:06:18] up younger when things look so dreary
[1:06:21] here there's always something going on
[1:06:25] in another world hey man that's right
[1:06:28] and I want to assure you today there is
[1:06:31] something that is happening in the
[1:06:34] unseen realms now this is what daniel
[1:06:39] said at that time shall Michael stand up
[1:06:41] the Great Prince which standeth for the
[1:06:44] children of thy people there should be a
[1:06:46] time of trouble such as never was since
[1:06:49] there was a nation to that Timon and at
[1:06:53] that time that people shall be delivered
[1:06:56] every one that be found written in the
[1:06:59] book and then revelation did one and I
[1:07:03] saw another mighty angel and I want you
[1:07:06] to know we are here in the final Exodus
[1:07:09] natural Israel has made her Exodus she
[1:07:13] has been brought out of the nations into
[1:07:16] her promised land and we should have
[1:07:19] been gathered out of the isms and ideas
[1:07:22] and ideologies of denomination and
[1:07:25] brought back to the promised land of the
[1:07:28] Bible of the word of God amens I believe
[1:07:32] we are in the final Exodus the Royal
[1:07:36] seed of Abraham is about to make her
[1:07:38] Exodus to go from earth to glory and I
[1:07:43] believe that God has prepared us for
[1:07:45] this moment in this time for this Exodus
[1:07:48] and then Exodus 23 in verse 20 I want to
[1:07:52] remind you in that Exodus Dillards an
[1:07:55] angel a man Jesus Christ is the same
[1:08:00] yesterday today and forever there's got
[1:08:03] to be an angel in this Exodus Exodus 23
[1:08:07] 20 be hold I send an angel before thee
[1:08:10] to keep thee end the way and to bring
[1:08:14] thee to the place which I have prepared
[1:08:18] God has prepared Israel the natural
[1:08:21] people the natural seed of Abraham Al
[1:08:24] and they have been gathered back to them
[1:08:27] a man and we have to say it's a
[1:08:31] phenomena it's a miracle
[1:08:34] oh yeah there has been scary times dark
[1:08:38] times trouble sometimes but they have
[1:08:41] prevailed
[1:08:42] they are nation today they have been
[1:08:44] gathered out of the nations back to
[1:08:47] their homeland but I want you to know
[1:08:49] there is a royal seed of Abraham and a
[1:08:53] man that corresponds with the natural
[1:08:55] seed of Abraham and I want you to know
[1:08:57] God is doing the same thing in the
[1:09:00] spiritual realm
[1:09:01] he has taken a people for his name's
[1:09:04] sake he has gathered them together he is
[1:09:07] moving them back to the homeland of the
[1:09:10] Bible or the Word of God where there is
[1:09:13] Bible times and Bible days Bible
[1:09:16] experiences and Bible signs and Bible
[1:09:20] wonders a Bible moving of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:23] hallelujah so he said I said I'm sending
[1:09:27] an angel ahead of you to guard you along
[1:09:31] the way and to bring you to the place
[1:09:34] that I have prepared for you I want you
[1:09:37] to know the angel of God it's been sent
[1:09:41] to guard us along the way to make sure
[1:09:44] we reach our homeland to make sure we
[1:09:49] get established in this word so that we
[1:09:52] can receive our Messiah and then the
[1:09:55] coming of the Lord Jesus the second time
[1:09:57] and as you see this angel was more than
[1:10:02] just a messenger but it was a whole
[1:10:04] nature the essence of divinity was in
[1:10:08] him if you see him he was there in
[1:10:11] Exodus 3 he was there in a pillar of
[1:10:14] fire in a burning bush and the bush did
[1:10:17] not burn but it was not a natural fire
[1:10:20] it was a spirits of fire a pillar of
[1:10:23] fire a glow of light a man the same one
[1:10:27] that Paul saw on the road to Damascus
[1:10:29] struck him down blinded his eyes knocked
[1:10:32] him off his high horse and he laid out
[1:10:33] in the street and said I have Jesus a
[1:10:37] man so again again they eat it was more
[1:10:42] than just a messenger it was God in
[1:10:46] messenger form understand this the same
[1:10:50] God moving now in a pillar of fire it
[1:10:54] would be that same God would be shown to
[1:10:57] thee to the Saints in the upper room and
[1:11:00] they would be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:11:02] tongues of fire coming down upon them
[1:11:05] suing their the very visible sign of the
[1:11:08] pillar of fire then it accelerated
[1:11:10] itself and now came upon 120 and then
[1:11:14] three thousand souls are afterwards
[1:11:16] now Exodus chapter 33 verse 12 Moses
[1:11:21] said to the people say they'll say us
[1:11:23] bring up this people and thou has not
[1:11:27] let me know whom that will send with me
[1:11:30] yet that was said I know thee my name
[1:11:33] and thou hast found grace in my sight so
[1:11:38] Moses said to the Lord Lord you you've
[1:11:40] been telling me to lead this people but
[1:11:44] you have not let me know who you're
[1:11:45] gonna send with me you said I know you
[1:11:48] by name and you found favor or grace and
[1:11:51] remember grace is favor that is revealed
[1:11:56] and making known of his way a man so in
[1:12:01] verse 13 he says not pray thee if I have
[1:12:04] found grace show me now that way that I
[1:12:09] may know thee because when we know the
[1:12:13] way we know him because he used the way
[1:12:17] a man now again we're we're going to see
[1:12:22] these children here in those few minutes
[1:12:24] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:12:27] because there's only one name given
[1:12:31] under heaven whereby men
[1:12:33] might be saved it is the way there is
[1:12:36] only one way to God and that is through
[1:12:38] Jesus Christ through his intercessory
[1:12:41] work and mine only one way to him all
[1:12:45] who call on the name of the Lord shall
[1:12:47] be saved the Bible said so yeah so again
[1:12:50] he says if you pleased with me treats me
[1:12:54] your ways so that I may know you and
[1:12:57] continue divine favor with you and
[1:13:01] remember that this nation is your people
[1:13:05] and man this was Moses saying the God
[1:13:08] you know God remember this we're your
[1:13:12] people and mine when we're facing things
[1:13:15] at this moment I don't think it's wrong
[1:13:18] to stand like Moses and say God remember
[1:13:21] your promises God remember where your
[1:13:25] people remember you said I'll never
[1:13:28] leave your forsaken remember you said
[1:13:31] I'll be with you and even in the end of
[1:13:33] the world I'll be there I'm gonna
[1:13:36] remember your promises remember you said
[1:13:39] you'd be the same yesterday today and
[1:13:41] forever remember you said you'd be their
[1:13:43] ever-present water from the rock
[1:13:45] remember Lord you'll be our needs
[1:13:47] supplier remember Lord you gave the
[1:13:50] promises we didn't make the promise you
[1:13:53] made the promise but you for we found
[1:13:55] grace we found favor in your sight and
[1:13:58] that you would call us your people my
[1:14:03] presence verse 14 usually he lets him
[1:14:06] know who's gonna go my presence shall go
[1:14:11] with thee my presence I want you to know
[1:14:15] in this moment who it is that's with us
[1:14:18] then never fail you may not be in the
[1:14:21] end the church house this morning maybe
[1:14:23] you're gathered in your home in a and I
[1:14:25] hope you're doing it reverently then
[1:14:28] with your Bibles open you know
[1:14:30] forgetting about the phone calls and the
[1:14:32] busyness and what else is going on and
[1:14:34] social media and just focus for a few
[1:14:37] moments here upon who it is it says that
[1:14:41] we'll go with you
[1:14:43] my presence shall be with thee and I
[1:14:46] will give you rest
[1:14:49] hallelujah rest is this peace I'll give
[1:14:53] you that peace man his personal presence
[1:14:57] was watching over the word hey man
[1:15:01] remember whenever a word is released
[1:15:04] when it is spoken God watches over that
[1:15:07] word and he sends a spirit after it to
[1:15:10] perform it he said my words will not
[1:15:14] return unto me void but it will
[1:15:16] accomplish what I've sent it to do now
[1:15:20] so there again
[1:15:21] the angel of God also called the angel
[1:15:25] of the Lord the angel of his presence
[1:15:27] the angel of Jehovah he stands out in
[1:15:31] distinct eminence preeminence rather in
[1:15:35] the Old Testament you know there was
[1:15:37] definitely a theophany
[1:15:39] mediator unique and distinct here it was
[1:15:43] we can see him and remember there's only
[1:15:45] one mediator between God and man and
[1:15:48] that's Jesus Christ but in the Old
[1:15:50] Testament notice the angel was either
[1:15:54] interceding on their behalf working on
[1:15:56] their behalf fighting on their behalf
[1:15:58] moving on their behalf man there was why
[1:16:02] there was definitely at the atomic
[1:16:04] mediator unique and distinct he
[1:16:07] introduced himself as deity he was
[1:16:10] called he was he called from heaven on
[1:16:13] two different occasions once when he
[1:16:15] stopped Abraham from sacrificing Isaac
[1:16:18] remember it was God mediating the age of
[1:16:23] the Lord calls him and said don't don't
[1:16:25] slain a man and then again when he
[1:16:29] promised him countless descendants it
[1:16:31] was there the angel of the Lord
[1:16:34] mediating working on the behalf he was a
[1:16:38] spokesman of the three men who came to
[1:16:41] announce Abraham the impending doom of
[1:16:44] sodom and gomorrah and to foretell the
[1:16:47] coming of the promised son it was the
[1:16:50] angel of the Lord that Abraham detained
[1:16:53] and his supplication for the city and
[1:16:56] nephew lot new you can remember Lord if
[1:16:59] there's fifty if there is twenty if
[1:17:01] there is ten he kept us going right on
[1:17:04] down on down imploring pleading a mile
[1:17:08] for the lost that's a sign of a real
[1:17:11] safer home and see the mayhem they're
[1:17:14] concerned about those who are lost and
[1:17:17] so you see it was again the angel of the
[1:17:21] Lord then that that that Abraham
[1:17:23] detained in his supplication and began
[1:17:26] to speak to and call upon and he
[1:17:29] entertained him there under the tree at
[1:17:31] Mamre in Genesis chapter 18 it was the
[1:17:34] angel of the Lord that accompanied
[1:17:37] Eliezer on his mission to get a wife for
[1:17:41] Isaac
[1:17:42] oh my you know when you think about it
[1:17:45] wasn't just happenstance if we could
[1:17:48] have looked in the unseen realm no doubt
[1:17:51] the angel Lord began to urge Rebekah to
[1:17:55] get down to to the the wealth and man to
[1:17:59] meet Elysa I mean she had to be there
[1:18:03] a man that something was moving in the
[1:18:06] unseen round and and there Eliezer was
[1:18:09] praying to none see invisible God
[1:18:13] hallelujah
[1:18:15] a man but was making himself known by
[1:18:18] the way he moved
[1:18:19] a man he would appear them to Jacob in a
[1:18:23] foreign land and identified himself
[1:18:26] that's the Karla Bethel he instructed
[1:18:29] him to go back home later wrestling with
[1:18:32] him in the night Jacob said I have met
[1:18:36] God face to face every individual that's
[1:18:40] ever met Jesus and wrestle it out until
[1:18:45] your walk was different to your top was
[1:18:47] different till your attitude was
[1:18:49] different
[1:18:50] you met God face to face and your life
[1:18:53] was changed hey man it was changed
[1:18:57] because you met God face to face
[1:19:00] there was Tamar when the light of Judah
[1:19:03] had all been extinguished and you
[1:19:06] remember the stories too deep for me to
[1:19:08] go into at this moment
[1:19:10] God was watching over his word because
[1:19:13] he'd said I love judo would come a
[1:19:15] deceptor that would rule over Israel and
[1:19:19] when the light of Judah was almost
[1:19:20] extinguished because there were no
[1:19:22] children given and Tamar was held away
[1:19:24] it was God intervening are you with me
[1:19:27] it was angel of the Lord who appeared to
[1:19:31] Moses in a burning bush and identified
[1:19:35] himself as the God of your father the
[1:19:38] God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the
[1:19:41] God of Jacob he identified himself as
[1:19:43] the I am that I am nothing I was but
[1:19:48] they ever-present God not I will be but
[1:19:51] I am that's who he is today the I am the
[1:19:55] never-fail in presence of Jesus Christ
[1:19:58] that is with us everywhere that we go
[1:20:03] now the same angel later guided and
[1:20:06] guarded Israelites that we just read
[1:20:08] about in their exodus from Egypt it was
[1:20:12] the angel of the Lord who talked with
[1:20:14] Moses in the wilderness and there was
[1:20:18] delivered the Ten Commandments to him on
[1:20:20] Mount sana it was the age the Lord that
[1:20:23] brought Balaam on his Road to curse
[1:20:26] Israel and refused to let him bring
[1:20:30] curses on God's people hear me what I'm
[1:20:35] saying in the middle in the middle of a
[1:20:38] crisis the angel Lord stops Balaam from
[1:20:44] bringing a curse on God's people I want
[1:20:48] to remind you again he's the same
[1:20:50] yesterday today and forever
[1:20:53] hey man he's able to hold all the curses
[1:20:56] he's able to keep us in safety he's able
[1:20:59] to keep us in garnish in our way
[1:21:02] it's him does that I'll never leave you
[1:21:05] or forsake you
[1:21:06] [Music]
[1:21:07] engage the Lord identified himself to
[1:21:10] Joshua as a commander of the army of the
[1:21:14] Lord think about it he looked and he saw
[1:21:18] a man with his hand with his sword John
[1:21:22] said are you witless
[1:21:24] are you far as Joshua said are you
[1:21:26] against us he exalts his sword he said
[1:21:29] no I'm not for you neither am I get see
[1:21:32] you're not only I'm not on your side
[1:21:34] here on my side I'm the one leading in
[1:21:37] this battle
[1:21:38] and I want you to understand friend God
[1:21:40] isn't the one on your side you're on
[1:21:42] God's side and because you're on God's
[1:21:44] side you're on the winning side a man so
[1:21:49] there as it would be said I'm there in
[1:21:55] the and William Branham would say this
[1:21:59] he would say now the book of Exodus in
[1:22:02] the there he said I like Indian up on
[1:22:08] this thirteenth chapter the pillar of
[1:22:09] fire pillar fire that led the children
[1:22:11] of Israel through the day in the night
[1:22:13] in the daytime it looked like a cloud
[1:22:15] nighttime it looked like a pillar of
[1:22:18] fire leading Egypt and that was none
[1:22:20] other than the Angel of the Covenant
[1:22:23] none other than Jesus Christ Himself
[1:22:26] before he was made flesh and come in the
[1:22:30] womb of Mary it was Christ Moses
[1:22:32] followed Christ if you remember that in
[1:22:35] the Bible hey man you know Moses
[1:22:38] followed Christ he drank from the rock
[1:22:41] which was Christ is that right hey man
[1:22:45] the scripture said that he was in the
[1:22:47] wilderness with Moses and that's who he
[1:22:50] was the angel of his covenant God being
[1:22:54] the messenger of his own covenant not
[1:22:56] that God's actually an angel but that he
[1:22:59] is the messenger of his own cabinet you
[1:23:04] see in the early period of the judges
[1:23:06] when Israel was forsaken God the angel
[1:23:10] of the Lord appeared at Bochum chapter 2
[1:23:14] of Judges says the angel of the Lord
[1:23:16] appeared
[1:23:17] at Bochum coming from Gilgal and
[1:23:20] announce to the people of israel i
[1:23:21] brought you out of Egypt into this land
[1:23:24] that I promised to your ancestors and I
[1:23:27] said I would never break my covenant
[1:23:29] with you notice the angel said I brought
[1:23:33] you out and I promise you and I said I
[1:23:38] will never break my covenant the age the
[1:23:43] Lord appeared to get him and
[1:23:45] commissioned him for military leadership
[1:23:48] he appears to Manoah and his wife and
[1:23:52] promised them a son Samson who would
[1:23:55] deliver his people he appears to David
[1:23:59] on the threshing floor of Ornan when he
[1:24:02] stopped the destroying angel and
[1:24:04] afterwards commanded the Prophet GAD to
[1:24:07] order David to build an altar on that
[1:24:10] rock and this would be the very place
[1:24:13] that David would build the temple think
[1:24:16] of that think of that a plant is going
[1:24:19] through there are thousands that are
[1:24:21] dying this is where David writes and
[1:24:23] sums 93 as he see people died ten
[1:24:27] thousand on you on one side and the
[1:24:28] thousand on the other but it will not
[1:24:30] come nigh thee neither will any plague
[1:24:33] come nigh thy dwelling what was it he
[1:24:36] was he was there looking there as a
[1:24:38] plague was in the life and he was
[1:24:42] claiming the promises and he looks up
[1:24:44] and he sees an angel standing with his
[1:24:47] sword drawn is that how long will you
[1:24:50] kill and destroy a man and there God
[1:24:54] commanded him to build an altar there in
[1:24:58] the threshing floor in the word that
[1:25:01] week was me and threshing amen at
[1:25:03] harvest time to build their a temple
[1:25:06] unto the Lord think about a place of
[1:25:09] worship and an altar of sacrifice to
[1:25:13] atone for the evils that was been Doni
[1:25:16] in the lands that it calls the plagues
[1:25:19] oh my in Ezekiel chapter 1 and 10
[1:25:24] through 13 or chapter 9 the ancient Lord
[1:25:28] receives a report
[1:25:29] the angels who patrol the earth and then
[1:25:32] ask God have mercy on Jerusalem and then
[1:25:35] wouldn't mark those who sighed and cried
[1:25:38] for the abominations that are done in
[1:25:40] the city oh I wondered today how many
[1:25:43] souls are crying sign for the sins that
[1:25:47] are being done in the world whether with
[1:25:50] the millions upon millions of our own
[1:25:54] children being put to death right in the
[1:25:57] womb of senators and of Representatives
[1:26:02] saying they wouldn't even support or
[1:26:05] revive or help a child who was born
[1:26:08] because of abortion people who become so
[1:26:12] hard-hearted mothers who will destroy
[1:26:15] their own life that is in their womb a
[1:26:19] god-given life and who is it the sign
[1:26:23] and cried real abomination that's done
[1:26:26] in this world today but it's not just
[1:26:28] that oh that's just the tip of the
[1:26:30] iceberg when there's crime when there's
[1:26:33] evil when there's every kind of evil
[1:26:36] device that is out there there's got to
[1:26:38] be a people that are silent crying that
[1:26:42] sin makes them sick that says Oh God
[1:26:45] you know God don't let us perish with
[1:26:48] the wicked and the Bible said you put a
[1:26:50] mark of all of those who sigh and cry
[1:26:53] for the abominations that are being done
[1:26:56] Amanda Marc is a sign of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:59] view he will mark knows with the Holy
[1:27:02] Spirit who saw angra just who is this
[1:27:09] angel of the Lord he is the
[1:27:13] pre-incarnate logos the word in the
[1:27:16] beginning was the word
[1:27:18] he is the distinct personal self
[1:27:22] manifestation of God are the Incarnate
[1:27:25] logos the Word made flesh that's who
[1:27:28] Jesus was this reference in judges shows
[1:27:32] clearly that the angel of God are the
[1:27:35] angel Lord is God in his self
[1:27:37] manifestation John declared he was
[1:27:41] creator for said by him all things are
[1:27:45] created and then that low Garson became
[1:27:49] flesh and dwelt among us it's
[1:27:52] interesting to note that this angel did
[1:27:55] not appear on earth while Jesus was in
[1:27:58] flesh just b-boy was born there was
[1:28:01] angels announced his birth right amen
[1:28:04] but there was no angelic visitation
[1:28:08] during the time of Jesus ministry upon
[1:28:11] the earth a man well while then this is
[1:28:15] amazing to think why because here now
[1:28:17] glob was now manifested not in an
[1:28:21] angelic form leading the children of
[1:28:24] Israel as an angel of his covenant the
[1:28:27] messenger of his own covenant but he's
[1:28:29] there now incarnate in Jesus Christ amen
[1:28:34] it's also amazing how often the
[1:28:37] appearance of the angel of the Lord
[1:28:39] marked a turning point in history he was
[1:28:44] it happened there at the founding of the
[1:28:46] chosen race with Abraham it was there
[1:28:49] with the deliverance of that same race
[1:28:52] from Egypt days Lord was there
[1:28:55] established in the Covenant at Mount
[1:28:57] Sinai he was there leading the people
[1:29:00] into a promised land he was there he was
[1:29:04] there laying the foundation for
[1:29:06] Solomon's Temple by ordinate altar to be
[1:29:09] built on onus on threshing floor he was
[1:29:13] there supporting Elijah in his battle
[1:29:16] against Jezebel and her pagans and then
[1:29:19] he was there protecting the elect in the
[1:29:23] Babylonian captivity I'd like to read
[1:29:26] Isaiah 63 and 8 starting with the end of
[1:29:29] that so he was their Savior and in
[1:29:34] aldair affliction he was afflicted and
[1:29:37] the angel of his presence saved them
[1:29:42] it is love in his pity he redeemed them
[1:29:45] and he bare them and carried them all
[1:29:49] the days of old oh that gives me so much
[1:29:54] comfort in his affliction their
[1:29:57] affliction he was afflicted and the
[1:29:59] angel of his presence saved them and in
[1:30:03] his pity he redeemed them and he bare
[1:30:06] them and carried them all the days of
[1:30:09] old what wonderful promises lay in the
[1:30:13] scripture what wonderful promises as we
[1:30:17] look in the end time and know that we're
[1:30:21] seeing things in the scene but there's
[1:30:24] got to be something happened in the
[1:30:25] unseen I just ask you today who is this
[1:30:31] that is taking us through Satan's Eden
[1:30:35] who is this that has made the promise
[1:30:39] that I'll never leave you or forsake you
[1:30:43] again in the end the film of the 20th
[1:30:47] century prophet William Branham says
[1:30:49] very well brother cop let's go back to
[1:30:52] the beginning I was born in Eastern
[1:30:54] Kentucky in a little log cabin in
[1:30:57] Burkesville Kentucky the morning my
[1:30:58] birth I'm told of my parents that there
[1:31:01] was a light coming to the room and hung
[1:31:04] over me my people were not a religious
[1:31:06] people they didn't go to any church of
[1:31:08] course this caused quite a stir among
[1:31:10] them it followed me all the days of my
[1:31:12] life recently they took a picture of it
[1:31:15] in the scientific world is shown here
[1:31:17] you're probably familiar with this
[1:31:18] picture and it was proven by science is
[1:31:21] the only supernatural being that was
[1:31:24] ever scientifically photographed in it
[1:31:27] to my opinion it is the same angel of
[1:31:30] God that followed the children of Israel
[1:31:32] from Egypt and the Palestine you know as
[1:31:36] a scholar yourself that was the angel of
[1:31:38] the Covenant none other than our Lord
[1:31:40] Jesus Christ and I just want to say to
[1:31:43] you don't you think for a moment that
[1:31:47] angels are not all around us the Bible
[1:31:52] said they in camp
[1:31:54] around about us you remember there and
[1:31:58] we'll look at it my Magic's and 52 when
[1:32:01] when Peter he went know when he drew his
[1:32:04] sword and he cut out the the ear of
[1:32:07] Malchus I'm there you know there's a lot
[1:32:11] of people say you know he just had a bad
[1:32:14] aim he really stripped for his head
[1:32:16] right on down to rip him wide open but
[1:32:19] he just hit his ear and cut it off and
[1:32:22] Jesus picked the ear up and put it back
[1:32:24] on and heals him right and he turns to
[1:32:29] Peter and he says put up again thy sword
[1:32:32] into its place for they that take the
[1:32:36] sword shall perish with the soul
[1:32:39] thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to
[1:32:43] my father and he suppressant ly give me
[1:32:46] more than twelve legions of angels now
[1:32:52] sometimes ago I figured this up a legion
[1:32:55] is you know it some translation said
[1:32:58] twelve armies of angels but a legion of
[1:33:01] angels at that time were were worth six
[1:33:06] thousand in a legion
[1:33:09] so we you know if he could call for
[1:33:11] twelve of them that would be
[1:33:14] approximately 72,000 angels that he
[1:33:19] could call in a moment
[1:33:23] and Jesus said if I call don't you know
[1:33:28] heaven will send 12 legions over seventy
[1:33:32] thousand angels to my rescue all I have
[1:33:35] to do is call only hey man no you say
[1:33:41] brother Tim but that was Jesus well
[1:33:44] let's look at Hebrews 12:22 but you are
[1:33:47] come to Mount Zion you come to the city
[1:33:50] of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem
[1:33:53] to an innumerable you can't even cáñamo
[1:33:58] company of angels
[1:34:00] this is where you come oh the Sun is
[1:34:04] right there's angels all around us to
[1:34:07] keep us from harm
[1:34:09] aim and angels all around us there's no
[1:34:12] need to be alarmed a man did them kind
[1:34:15] and pretentious oh my are you with me
[1:34:18] hey man so again you you again oh there
[1:34:23] were angels on your side with Jesus
[1:34:26] there it is hour of temptation and he
[1:34:29] met Lucifer face servation Matthew 4:4
[1:34:32] truth board for the angels afterwards
[1:34:34] came and strengthened him my life word
[1:34:39] guess simile the angels came and
[1:34:42] strengthened him for the cross I want
[1:34:46] you to know no matter what you're going
[1:34:48] through the angels are there to
[1:34:52] strengthen you you are not alone you may
[1:34:59] feel very alone you and your family in
[1:35:01] your home this morning we might feel
[1:35:04] very alone and we're looking at a church
[1:35:08] that normally is packed out ma'am but
[1:35:11] just trying to respect the government
[1:35:15] orders that didn't tell us to shut down
[1:35:18] but just trying to do our part in the
[1:35:21] community to help quell this virus that
[1:35:24] is going on it's not because we don't
[1:35:26] believe God won't protect us we believe
[1:35:28] you will and mine we're we believe that
[1:35:31] he'll be with us even in us to the end
[1:35:33] of the world but here you may feel all
[1:35:36] along but I want you to know you're not
[1:35:38] alone I mean you may give the situation
[1:35:41] your posture can't even get to you but I
[1:35:45] want you to know you're not alone you
[1:35:48] will never be alone
[1:35:50] he said I'll never leave you or forsake
[1:35:53] you
[1:35:54] you're not forsaken you're not forgotten
[1:35:57] never forgive the angel said he's the
[1:36:01] same yesterday today and forever
[1:36:06] let me think of this - power of 72,000
[1:36:11] angels you know in the book of Kings the
[1:36:16] second Kings actually in a moment when
[1:36:21] it was a calamity it was a horrible time
[1:36:24] the Assyrians had come down and camped
[1:36:27] against them they were mocking making
[1:36:29] fun of them
[1:36:30] twisting the word if you read it they'll
[1:36:33] even take the commandments the Lord and
[1:36:35] so I'm back to the Israel and try to
[1:36:37] twist it in and make them confused and
[1:36:41] and disbelieve their king the city is
[1:36:44] set up oh you know horrible things are
[1:36:48] happening and and the Bible said and in
[1:36:52] second Kings 1935 and I'll just read
[1:36:55] this translation that night the angel
[1:36:58] Lord went out and put to death a hundred
[1:37:01] and eighty five thousand in the Assyrian
[1:37:05] camp and when the people got up the next
[1:37:07] morning they were all dead bodies man
[1:37:13] one angel took care of a hundred
[1:37:16] eighty-five thousand a man what then
[1:37:21] could seventy-two thousand angels do a
[1:37:25] man that covers the population of the
[1:37:28] earth twice over a man why because the
[1:37:32] AIDS Lord will not killed a hundred and
[1:37:35] eighty-five thousand let me tell you
[1:37:37] he's still God
[1:37:40] a man is still the same yesterday today
[1:37:43] and forever the angel still has as much
[1:37:46] authority and power is ahead then
[1:37:50] amounts of a single angel had that kind
[1:37:52] of power what would be the combined
[1:37:55] strength of twelve legions of angels and
[1:38:00] Daniel chapter 12 chooses Michael stands
[1:38:03] up to deliver God's people revelation 12
[1:38:09] Sue's us Michael when he stands up its
[1:38:12] wall he's not just standing up to take a
[1:38:17] break from City
[1:38:19] oh no he's standing up for the children
[1:38:22] of his people come on to deliver them a
[1:38:26] man in Revelation 12 shows us Michael
[1:38:30] when he stands up it's war
[1:38:32] he's declaring war I want you to know
[1:38:36] little Church Michael has stood up the
[1:38:40] angel of his presence has stood up
[1:38:42] Michael means who is like Jehovah a man
[1:38:46] has stood up a man what's he doing he's
[1:38:49] declaring war man against Satan and his
[1:38:54] hosts there's a battle now that is going
[1:38:58] on you are seeing things and people
[1:39:00] dying and you see the effects of the
[1:39:02] evil spirit I want you to know you're
[1:39:05] going to see the effects of the Holy
[1:39:07] Spirit as he goes out bring it delivered
[1:39:10] and keeping his people and support us
[1:39:12] during the sign there is something that
[1:39:17] happens in the spirit realm that causes
[1:39:22] Satan to fall I want you to know when
[1:39:33] that angel came to William Branham in
[1:39:35] 1946 even the coming of that angel was a
[1:39:40] declaration of war against the Fallen
[1:39:44] Angels of Darkness but to win the war
[1:39:49] people have to believe
[1:39:54] you see it's the time that we believe
[1:39:58] like we've never believed we have faith
[1:40:02] like we never have faith a man it's a
[1:40:07] time where to win the war you're going
[1:40:10] to have to believe now it may seem
[1:40:14] strange to you but God can neither heal
[1:40:17] you our Savior against your will so I'll
[1:40:24] now predestination by the gentleman
[1:40:26] foreknowledge yeah God knows by this
[1:40:29] foreknowledge and yes he's predestinated
[1:40:31] but he's got to have your wheel to be
[1:40:34] surrendered to his will
[1:40:37] amen William Branham would say this
[1:40:41] crisis here and I declare to you he's
[1:40:44] raised from the dead he loves you he
[1:40:47] wants your soul he wants to heal you he
[1:40:50] wants to make you happy he wants to
[1:40:52] bring you up to glory then he can only
[1:40:56] do it as you permit him to do it he
[1:40:59] can't do it against your will so you
[1:41:04] must invite him in if you look in
[1:41:08] Revelation chapter 3 in the last church
[1:41:11] age which were young Leia to see him and
[1:41:15] he says behold I stand at the door and I
[1:41:18] knock and if any man will open the door
[1:41:21] I will come in notice he doesn't push
[1:41:24] the door open the requirement is for the
[1:41:28] man to open the door I will come in I
[1:41:33] will sup with you I'll bring out
[1:41:35] fellowship with you and you with me
[1:41:37] right so you see there's a part we've
[1:41:42] got to do in this war the angels are
[1:41:47] fighting but you got to be believing
[1:41:50] this is when your faith must remain
[1:41:54] strong now there was a man one time that
[1:42:00] made a portrait of Christ he was a
[1:42:03] famous painter and so
[1:42:07] you know in order to holla hang in the
[1:42:09] Hall of Fame you had to go to the hall
[1:42:10] of critics
[1:42:11] kind of like us but we can hang in the
[1:42:14] Hall of Fame we have to go through the
[1:42:16] Hall of critics but anyway this the
[1:42:19] critics were looking at it and they said
[1:42:23] you know it's a wonderful picture Christ
[1:42:25] standing on the outside of the door but
[1:42:28] you made an obvious to me that's very
[1:42:31] obvious mistake here there's no latch on
[1:42:34] the door and the artist said no I did it
[1:42:39] on purpose I put no latch on the outside
[1:42:42] because in this case the latch is on the
[1:42:45] inside
[1:42:45] the one that's on the inside has to open
[1:42:49] it he cannot open it from the outside he
[1:42:55] cannot save you against your will
[1:42:58] he cannot heal you against your will he
[1:43:02] cannot send a revival against her will
[1:43:06] you've got to be willing and opened the
[1:43:09] door and invite him in again way brother
[1:43:16] madam would say and he cares you care
[1:43:18] could God save you against your will
[1:43:20] certainly not he can't heal you against
[1:43:23] her will you've got to believe it he was
[1:43:27] told by the angel if you can get the
[1:43:29] people to believe see the angel can do
[1:43:34] all kinds of signs through a sign gift
[1:43:37] it can discern your heart he can tell
[1:43:40] you where you're from they can do all
[1:43:41] those things only are done to elevate
[1:43:44] faith to cause you to believe but if you
[1:43:49] don't believe there's no healing
[1:43:51] there'll be no miracle that follows you
[1:43:54] must believe so the angels that you must
[1:43:58] get the people to believe and then
[1:44:01] nothing will stand before your prayer
[1:44:04] not even cancer
[1:44:09] beneath the people believe so the battle
[1:44:13] is in the unseen round and it's a
[1:44:19] level over you Satan trying to not you
[1:44:25] with unbelief and if you be honest you
[1:44:31] have been you have been he's tried to
[1:44:34] anoint you in these last few weeks
[1:44:37] without fear confusion questions come on
[1:44:45] a man ever everything else of you you've
[1:44:49] questioned everything oh we missed the
[1:44:51] rapture are we in the tribulation how
[1:44:54] could you miss sir rapture you are the
[1:44:57] rapture hey man you're the ones he's
[1:45:00] coming for his people for his namesake
[1:45:04] hey man the very reason he came to
[1:45:07] Calvary was to get a bride without spot
[1:45:09] or wrinkle he's not gonna go back it'd
[1:45:12] be handed he's gonna accomplish what he
[1:45:15] said he would do he'll have that church
[1:45:21] so Satan shunned anoint you with
[1:45:23] unbelief fear which is unbelief you see
[1:45:30] there's no fear and love perfect love
[1:45:33] casts out fear when you get back and you
[1:45:37] get your focus back on Jesus and in
[1:45:39] perfect love with him all fear is gone
[1:45:41] you know he's gonna do what he said
[1:45:43] right hey man so again Satan of Thailand
[1:45:49] on shoes with unbelief you'll try to
[1:45:50] anoint your faith and yet God is sending
[1:45:55] you the word gifts signs testimonies I
[1:46:01] mean you know it's just like I recounted
[1:46:05] last night as you as you know we've got
[1:46:08] a miracle that has happened in our
[1:46:10] family where that the angel of God when
[1:46:14] brother Ron Spencer was here angel of
[1:46:16] God met him and said that that tonight
[1:46:19] is Esther's night and now Esther after
[1:46:23] night in 16 years of being barren has
[1:46:27] got as has a child in her womb the man I
[1:46:32] stood it's

[1:46:52] were Hannah prayed for child I prayed
[1:46:55] for a church that has been buried for
[1:46:57] 2,000 years to bring both sides of life
[1:46:59] and to be a rapture in this age God
[1:47:05] gives us a sign
[1:47:07] little girl been waiting cried 3 in 16
[1:47:11] years now as a child in ruin in that
[1:47:15] sister Elena we told her testimony
[1:47:17] healed there again I didn't see the
[1:47:21] angel that day but he was here I saw
[1:47:24] when she got up out of her seat and
[1:47:26] circled this building twice they're
[1:47:28] running and shouting with her victory
[1:47:31] dance there and there she was dying with
[1:47:35] him with a cancer in the lungs Hodgkin's

[1:47:54] very next day no cancer now nearly two
[1:47:59] years later scam after scam no cancer I

[1:48:10] grace I'm out in my like I said you know
[1:48:14] what their life suddenly when when it
[1:48:17] come into my home and my wife with a
[1:48:18] brain bleed and laying there and brain
[1:48:21] bleed this big around significant
[1:48:22] getting back there took away your
[1:48:24] peripheral vision and there was blind
[1:48:26] and I'm just saying to you today he's
[1:48:30] still the same God moment we can get our
[1:48:33] hearts set on believing a man open up
[1:48:37] your heart to him this morning believing
[1:48:39] that man he's still for you they're a
[1:48:43] little time
[1:48:44] eighteen months old it never crawled
[1:48:46] could not walk could not could not take
[1:48:49] a step step and I haven't been seen in a
[1:48:53] vision that he would walk and there but
[1:48:56] sat there at the end of the bed that
[1:48:57] morning and when my wife turned from
[1:49:00] from sorrow to praise and begin to
[1:49:04] praise the Lord it calls the angel of
[1:49:06] God to draw near and sweep across her
[1:49:10] bed and the vision come back I didn't
[1:49:13] see the angel but I know he's there
[1:49:15] because that little boy that was sitting
[1:49:17] there there at the end of the bed got up
[1:49:20] for his first time and his first steps
[1:49:23] wasn't a walk or a step or two his first
[1:49:26] steps was running all around my house
[1:49:29] while his mother walked around in
[1:49:32] amazement saying praise Jesus praise
[1:49:34] Jesus praise Jesus and I was there and I
[1:49:38] knew the angel of God had passed to our
[1:49:41] house hey man I want you to know you
[1:49:45] pass through your house you come your
[1:49:48] way today amen this God is a God who
[1:49:52] answers a call of his children
[1:49:58] the first battle that was ever fought
[1:50:01] was not fought on earth it was filed in
[1:50:03] the heavens Michael and his angels
[1:50:06] fought against Luther Lucifer
[1:50:08] they were kicked out of heaven then that
[1:50:11] great army of the devil and his em fell
[1:50:13] upon the earth
[1:50:14] and God knew there was going to be a
[1:50:16] battle he knew there wasn't going to be
[1:50:19] a battle when you're seeing a war in the
[1:50:22] unseen it happens on earth Amen I want
[1:50:25] you to get the glimpse right now if
[1:50:27] you're seeing you know again you know
[1:50:31] you you don't see the wind where it come
[1:50:33] from you don't know where it's going
[1:50:35] well you see the effects hey man we see
[1:50:38] these spirits coming through the land we
[1:50:41] see their facts but we also see them
[1:50:45] another effect
[1:50:47] because there's never time man that
[1:50:51] Satan takes after God's children then he
[1:50:53] don't have Jesus Christ on his hands
[1:50:56] when they were kicked out of heaven this
[1:50:59] great army of the devil all his hymns
[1:51:01] fell to the earth God knew there was
[1:51:04] gonna be a battle he knew from the
[1:51:05] beginning there was going to be a battle
[1:51:08] and this first battle ever fought began
[1:51:11] in heaven Michael and his angels would
[1:51:13] fight against Lucifer and his angel
[1:51:15] first started in the first battle in
[1:51:18] heaven sin didn't originate on the earth
[1:51:20] it originated in heaven right hey man
[1:51:24] Lucifer said I will and exalted his own
[1:51:28] will over God's will
[1:51:31] Isaiah 14:12 so sin began in heaven but
[1:51:36] soon it came down to earth and now it
[1:51:39] starts being fought in human battles so
[1:51:42] there I fell on humans and the battle
[1:51:45] from angels became human battles and
[1:51:49] Satan came down to destroy God's created
[1:51:52] creator what God created for himself now
[1:51:56] Satan comes to destroy and now the
[1:52:00] battle is raging and it's beginning us
[1:52:05] and remember the first place in attack
[1:52:08] Eve was in the mind
[1:52:11] yay hath God said now Eve is sheltered
[1:52:16] behind the word if she'll just stay with
[1:52:18] what God says everything will be okay
[1:52:21] the devil can't do anything when you
[1:52:24] stay behind God's word but the moment
[1:52:27] she begins to reason and that's where it
[1:52:32] wars it wars in your mind your soul may
[1:52:38] be sealed and Holy Ghost filled but
[1:52:42] Satan still can come in the realm of
[1:52:44] your mind to try to ward off the
[1:52:48] blessings that come with salvation the
[1:52:52] blessings of healing the blessings of
[1:52:54] peace now you're saying and the same
[1:52:58] people you're supposed to have the
[1:52:59] blessings of healing
[1:53:01] the blessings of beef right but you see
[1:53:05] there's gets to be war and where does
[1:53:08] the war come it comes in your mind and

[1:55:14] if your mind is stayed on him but we're
[1:55:19] hearing all of these other things and
[1:55:22] Satan whispering in my ear
[1:55:25] come on now I want you to know God
[1:55:33] cannot bless over sin and sin is
[1:55:38] unbelief unbelief is sin and even as a
[1:55:46] Christian even as a Christian you may
[1:55:50] not smoke drink commit adultery month
[1:55:53] you might get married only one time I've
[1:55:55] been a virgin when you married you you
[1:55:56] might have a perfect track record all of
[1:55:59] all that or maybe your past is forgiven
[1:56:01] and from there you've been walking
[1:56:03] perfectly before the Lord but you're
[1:56:04] still dealing with doubts Satan
[1:56:10] whispered in your ear and with us you're
[1:56:14] listening to your reason and a fear
[1:56:17] comes and you begin to doubt you know
[1:56:22] what you need to do repent repent that's
[1:56:29] God to forgive you why would you ever
[1:56:32] doubt your Savior come on why would you
[1:56:37] listen to this costumer in your ear
[1:56:40] you're listening to everything else
[1:56:43] everybody's touched in the next event on
[1:56:46] Facebook and the next worries in the
[1:56:48] next miss and the next step people are
[1:56:51] worried but you know you've got to have
[1:56:55] cooperative faith Jesus when he would
[1:56:59] pray many times he would put the people
[1:57:01] out they didn't believe we're unbelief
[1:57:03] is you can't do anything you can't he
[1:57:05] preached the gospel you can't even talk
[1:57:08] work where there's unbelief hardly it
[1:57:11] takes faith and then and then you know
[1:57:15] then um you know then when you when you
[1:57:18] stop believing and unite together it is
[1:57:21] calls to one another and you see the
[1:57:24] Holy Spirit's
[1:57:25] this isn't that one another it gives you
[1:57:27] faith to start believing for yourself
[1:57:30] Amen but the same thing happens in the
[1:57:33] demonic realm you see fear is contagious
[1:57:40] that man is catching because an evil
[1:57:44] spirit comes and calls out and trying to
[1:57:47] get you to disbelieve you see human
[1:57:51] battles they battles from angels became
[1:57:54] human battles the Bible said in Matthew
[1:57:58] 13 58 and he did not many mighty works
[1:58:02] there because of their unbelief
[1:58:08] so God operates where faith is I've done
[1:58:13] said he will not operate against your
[1:58:16] will the man with the demon-possessed
[1:58:22] son did Mark 92022 that that the
[1:58:29] disciples couldn't cast out and Jesus
[1:58:31] said it was because of your unbelief and
[1:58:37] he would say to Jesus but if thou can do
[1:58:40] anything have compassion on us and help
[1:58:45] us and Jesus said if thou kemp's believe
[1:58:51] all things are possible to him that
[1:58:54] believeth and straightway the father of
[1:58:57] the child cried out and with two severed
[1:59:00] ears lord I believe help thou mine
[1:59:05] unbelief amen
[1:59:10] Romans 10 and verse 9 says it's out
[1:59:14] confess with that mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:59:16] and believe in thine heart that God has
[1:59:20] raised from the dead thou shalt be saved
[1:59:24] notice confession with the mouth and
[1:59:26] believing in the heart it takes it takes
[1:59:29] believing for salvation
[1:59:34] for with the heart man believeth unto
[1:59:36] righteousness with the mouth confession
[1:59:38] is made to salvation for the scripture
[1:59:42] said whosoever believeth on me shall not
[1:59:44] be ashamed so again if we believe on him
[1:59:49] we won't be ashamed he's gonna do what
[1:59:52] he said Amen even your salvation is
[1:59:56] based on believing a man he that cometh
[2:00:01] to God must believe that he is not that
[2:00:05] he was not that he will be but that he
[2:00:07] is and that he will reward those that
[2:00:10] diligently seek Him you can't even get a
[2:00:13] prayer answered unless you believe you
[2:00:22] know I was struck so often as I listen
[2:00:24] to these discernment lines how often
[2:00:28] there was a battle between the demons of
[2:00:30] unbelief to try to get people to believe
[2:00:33] remember that was his commission I'm
[2:00:35] giving you signs to get people to
[2:00:38] believe and if you can get them to
[2:00:41] believe nothing will stand before you so
[2:00:48] it all hinges on us believing God could
[2:00:54] send signs and wonders but if you don't
[2:00:56] believe it Jesus could appear in the
[2:00:59] city who healed the sick cast out devils
[2:01:02] did oh and couldn't have me mighty
[2:01:03] miracles there because any believe him
[2:01:14] so the whole effort ever service was a
[2:01:17] battle it was a war against unbelief and
[2:01:23] exercise and first the word being
[2:01:26] preached then signs and wonders being
[2:01:28] done to get people to believe and once
[2:01:32] they believed they could be healed
[2:01:37] because they had to open the locks for
[2:01:42] healing and you've got if you're
[2:01:45] listening to me today in your ear you're
[2:01:48] wondering am i saved it has traveled
[2:01:50] some time you know it's time that you
[2:01:53] believe believe like you never before
[2:01:59] believe that his word is the truth
[2:02:02] believe he will not lie then he will not
[2:02:06] go back on his word he said I'll fill
[2:02:08] you with the Holy Ghost and receive it
[2:02:12] open the door to it it's that simple
[2:02:17] it don't have to be are you if you
[2:02:20] something that happened to you during
[2:02:22] this time will you will be okay or maybe
[2:02:25] say I hope so you can now sell you can
[2:02:30] be sure so I guess that it was service
[2:02:38] and and every service we've ever had
[2:02:40] here it's always the same getting people
[2:02:43] to believe you preached the word why you
[2:02:49] use examples in the scriptures why you
[2:02:52] here we use examples and testimonies of
[2:02:54] healing why to get people to believe you
[2:02:58] know if they start believing the devil's
[2:03:00] got to leave the war is going to be won
[2:03:04] not Jesus won the war at Calvary but
[2:03:09] Satan comes in as a squatter he has no
[2:03:13] legal right to you as a believer Amen
[2:03:17] you're not here you're not his property
[2:03:19] he has no right to your body
[2:03:23] mm because it's been redeemed by God I
[2:03:25] mean you've got a down payment of your
[2:03:27] honor of your new body come on
[2:03:30] and then you got there you've got
[2:03:31] salvation within your soul is the
[2:03:33] deposit of eternal life where you're
[2:03:36] going to receive the full potential of
[2:03:38] it when the month the moment that you're
[2:03:40] changed a man but it but at the same
[2:03:44] time there's a still just war and Satan
[2:03:51] comes and he comes to the reasoning in
[2:03:55] your mind to stop making you doubt he
[2:04:00] can't take away your salvation but he
[2:04:04] can keep you from enjoying the benefits
[2:04:07] of your salvation healing deliverance
[2:04:11] peace joy he can cloud you with
[2:04:16] depression and yet you're redeemed
[2:04:19] individual filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:04:22] and wind up taking your life it drives
[2:04:24] you so insane think about that
[2:04:30] but I'm the preaching of the word is to
[2:04:34] cast out devils then you know then God
[2:04:38] had signs to that to also elevate faith
[2:04:43] he gives testimonies of healings
[2:04:46] deliverance examples in the Bible oh how
[2:04:49] much how much freaks have we have we get
[2:04:54] gendered from one example in the Bible
[2:04:58] David and Goliath how many times
[2:05:01] millions of times has been preached
[2:05:03] across pulpits given faith to the
[2:05:06] believer that you can defeat the giant
[2:05:08] in your life hey man it was what was it
[2:05:13] do it getting people to believe
[2:05:15] now once faith was there then what
[2:05:19] Calvary had afford it was available to
[2:05:22] him that was available in all time but
[2:05:24] he can't be forced on you against your
[2:05:26] will
[2:05:27] so you gotta start believing to accept
[2:05:30] that
[2:05:30] just like you except your salvation and
[2:05:33] you were saying you gotta accept healing
[2:05:35] the same way by his stripes I'm healed
[2:05:40] he was wounded for my transgression
[2:05:43] therefore I'm saved by what he did at
[2:05:46] Calvary he took the stripes for me I'm
[2:05:48] healed
[2:05:51] listen and I'm time to try to hurry but
[2:05:55] we only have one service today so you
[2:05:58] know we're here for to really lay in
[2:06:01] some things and there's thousands of
[2:06:04] people listening right movement this
[2:06:06] moment and you're you're gathering
[2:06:08] strength right now from the things I'm
[2:06:10] speaking to you listen to this little
[2:06:13] quotation he said your ever'one
[2:06:17] Christians I presume then if you're
[2:06:19] Christians you have a right a legal
[2:06:23] right for everything Christ died for it
[2:06:26] is your possession you on it it's yours
[2:06:29] the only thing you can do is do like
[2:06:32] Abraham after he had endured a fight he
[2:06:36] obtained the promise Satan don't just
[2:06:40] let you take it easy you've got to have
[2:06:42] faith you've got to believe it
[2:06:43] you've got to n do it those who said
[2:06:47] that land belongs to you yet it's fenced
[2:06:49] up with Philistines and amirite skåne
[2:06:52] eyes all of them everything else it's
[2:06:54] yours I give it to you now go take it
[2:06:59] till you see Jesus paid for it he gave
[2:07:05] it to you but you've got to go take it
[2:07:07] the land was given the Israel but they
[2:07:11] had to go kick out the Canaanites the
[2:07:15] parasites and the jebusites and and even
[2:07:19] sometimes the websites
[2:07:22] hey ma'am so divine healing is to every
[2:07:27] one of you and it belongs to you now can
[2:07:30] you go take it go take it this morning
[2:07:33] go on it's yours nothing can harm you
[2:07:35] you're in Christ why they were going in
[2:07:38] that battle and women without losing
[2:07:41] soldier come on take in Jericho Bastogne
[2:07:46] by the words of God release from their
[2:07:50] mouths as the trumpets blew and they
[2:07:51] shouted walls came down I'm out because
[2:07:58] of their self something happened in the
[2:08:00] unseen round and that's the only way to
[2:08:04] give the unseen RAM to work for you is
[2:08:07] for you to start believing it an act an
[2:08:10] opponent in the unseen realm brother
[2:08:15] Branham would often see faith and I'm
[2:08:17] going from these discernment lines he
[2:08:21] will often see faith as a milky white
[2:08:24] cloud and he would see demons as dark
[2:08:28] streaks and shadows now back in the
[2:08:31] seventies of course I was a boy preacher
[2:08:34] I was started preaching when I was
[2:08:36] fifteen and about the mid seventies I
[2:08:39] went up and down northern Arkansas and I
[2:08:42] was preaching a revival um it was in my
[2:08:48] early 20s might have been even later
[2:08:51] toward the 7 in the end of 70s but
[2:08:54] reaching to a revival for a man by the
[2:08:56] name of Henry Daris
[2:08:58] Henry Daris told me of an experience
[2:09:02] that he had where he went to a tent
[2:09:06] meeting in Jonesboro Arkansas William
[2:09:10] Branham was there preaching he said I
[2:09:12] couldn't get a seat under the tent so he
[2:09:15] said I squeezed my way in and I found me
[2:09:18] a place by tent pole he said I had a
[2:09:22] cancer in my throat and he said it was
[2:09:26] choking me to death and I was in a dying
[2:09:30] condition and I went there I didn't have
[2:09:34] a hope of a doctor in the poor Arkansas
[2:09:37] heals who has had not even any money for
[2:09:40] doctors and there he said I went to that
[2:09:44] meeting that day and I was leaning
[2:09:46] against the temple and he said there was
[2:09:49] a woman came in the prayer line and he
[2:09:53] said it's William Branham begins
[2:09:54] speak to her in Jonesboro Arkansas we
[2:09:58] need to pray for that place right now
[2:09:59] they just had a Tornai to go through it
[2:10:01] him and pray for all of those someone
[2:10:04] even people have lost their homes and
[2:10:06] things businesses destroyed the grace of
[2:10:10] God
[2:10:11] they'd been all full like the normal are
[2:10:14] there were been many people killed but
[2:10:17] nevertheless and jumps Jonesboro there
[2:10:19] was a tent meeting going on William
[2:10:21] Branham was preaching there this was
[2:10:24] about 1953 I think said I was leaning
[2:10:28] against the temple a woman came up on in
[2:10:31] the prayer line they would approach from
[2:10:35] the roof from his right come this way
[2:10:38] he began to talk to her tell her what
[2:10:41] your name is and your trouble your
[2:10:44] trouble is you have cancer is in your
[2:10:47] throat and he stops for a minute he said
[2:10:50] wait a minute
[2:10:51] he said I see something everybody be
[2:10:55] reverent just a moment I see a dark
[2:10:58] streak it's running it's running back
[2:11:01] it's screaming out help me help me it's
[2:11:04] a demon and his scream and help me now
[2:11:07] listen all of this is going the unseen
[2:11:09] you can see it you couldn't hear it but
[2:11:13] here this prophet was looking into the
[2:11:15] unseen realm and here he hears now a
[2:11:18] battle that is going on the angel of God
[2:11:23] is present anointing the woman with
[2:11:26] faith to believe she's starting to
[2:11:28] believe because she knows if God knows
[2:11:32] her name and what her trouble is that he
[2:11:35] also can heal her sickness so her faith
[2:11:38] is starting to elevate and when it does
[2:11:40] a demon begins to scream out that is in
[2:11:44] her over here to this man Henry Daris
[2:11:47] leaning against the temple and as he
[2:11:51] does as he does now this is Henry's
[2:11:54] testimony he says as he does William
[2:11:56] Branham looks he said it's that man
[2:11:58] there lead him by the temple
[2:12:00] you've got cancer in the throat also
[2:12:02] don't you sir he said the demon this
[2:12:05] woman is
[2:12:06] ran out to the demon in you trying to
[2:12:08] get her to disbelieve trying to
[2:12:11] reinforce doubt a man but he's been
[2:12:16] exposed and now you're believing and
[2:12:19] because you're believing that you're
[2:12:21] both delivered what was it a war that
[2:12:25] was going on and demons congregating to
[2:12:29] try to press and make one disbelieve
[2:12:33] because in order to be healed they had
[2:12:36] to behave let me just read this one said
[2:12:46] a gift of God is here he said of Germans
[2:12:48] of life and you have a human life you
[2:12:52] can contact see this is William Branham
[2:12:57] didn't look at diseases as if they were
[2:13:00] you know tubercular this and that he did
[2:13:03] it directly as Jesus did in the Bible
[2:13:05] thou evil spirit and so as he did he
[2:13:11] would call out discern and he says he
[2:13:16] would call him evil spy he didn't call
[2:13:18] him so much by the doctors name he said
[2:13:20] the doctor calls him this but it's a
[2:13:22] devil and this spirit here and that
[2:13:26] spirit there that's giving you that
[2:13:27] tubercular knows that the hour is near
[2:13:31] and it's pushing back and when that
[2:13:36] spirit goes out to meet it's just like a
[2:13:39] warfare so he says now Satan lost the
[2:13:42] battle at Calvary but he's come and
[2:13:45] squatted on you he's there he's got a
[2:13:50] place in your body and with this cancer
[2:13:53] he is trying to get you to disbelieve
[2:13:55] and fear has come with it and now the
[2:13:59] angel of God is present and the word is
[2:14:02] telling you that by a structure healed
[2:14:04] and the angel is here discern in your
[2:14:07] heart and you're beginning to believe
[2:14:09] and there's a warfare going on and it
[2:14:14] depends on which one you've been
[2:14:19] again he said the spirit goes out to
[2:14:22] meet he says now again I'm just a man
[2:14:26] I'm your brother and there's an
[2:14:28] anointing coming here which you're aware
[2:14:30] of now I want you to watch friends
[2:14:33] what's the patient's face when they come
[2:14:35] near once is it coming like that what's
[2:14:38] the expression on their face when they
[2:14:40] come and we're feeling the presence of
[2:14:42] that angel and if the angel of the Lord
[2:14:46] will come near then the angel of
[2:14:49] sickness which would be on you he will
[2:14:52] go to pulling see the angel of the Lord
[2:14:56] is near now there's both powers and
[2:14:58] they're fighting one against the other
[2:15:02] now depends on our faith now that
[2:15:06] sickness whatever you have if that's
[2:15:08] pulling on you is going to try to put
[2:15:11] everything in your mind to keep you from
[2:15:15] believing that this is the truth and
[2:15:18] this which is coming now and me speaking
[2:15:21] to you is trying to get you to believe
[2:15:24] that it's the truth and now here's the
[2:15:26] offer if you will believe it then this
[2:15:29] here the Holy Spirit will pronounce the
[2:15:32] blessing and Satan has to need so you
[2:15:36] see it's a warfare now this is what I'm
[2:15:40] suing you here in Daniel 12 there's a
[2:15:42] war going on and ever service there's a
[2:15:46] war going on in the in the place where
[2:15:49] you're at this morning and your service
[2:15:52] at home there's a war going on and Satan
[2:15:56] there is trying to put doubts and fear
[2:15:59] and then sentient he in your life when
[2:16:01] you are you have been instructed to be
[2:16:04] certain of God to be sure he's the same
[2:16:07] yesterday today and forever or that his
[2:16:09] word is the truth but Satan is coming in
[2:16:13] trying to bring his fear his doubt his
[2:16:16] confusion again in the healing line he
[2:16:19] said he said his presence is here you
[2:16:22] believe he's here this is a cancerous
[2:16:25] condition he says and that
[2:16:29] man sitting there now he's got someone
[2:16:31] on the prone in the prayer line on the
[2:16:33] platform
[2:16:34] it's a cancerous condition and the man
[2:16:37] sitting there and he points to somebody
[2:16:39] in the audience has the same thing and
[2:16:42] them demons are screaming one to another
[2:16:45] for pity for mercy they're calling and
[2:16:48] so is the angels of God calling and the
[2:16:54] battle is here now your faith will
[2:16:57] determine which way it goes and he says
[2:17:03] he looks out there to the man in the
[2:17:06] audience said you believe that I come
[2:17:07] off your face sir you believe it gotta
[2:17:09] let you yet well you do sitting there
[2:17:12] with the mother there you believe it now
[2:17:14] it's screaming for mercy both of them
[2:17:15] there's a pool there's a pool and he
[2:17:19] turns back to the woman on the platform
[2:17:21] and said you had an operation for your
[2:17:23] I'll see a hospital there's a surgery
[2:17:26] going on it was in the stomach
[2:17:28] intestines there it form did not or
[2:17:30] something's growing back in the place
[2:17:32] like that that's a true circuit because
[2:17:33] it was a man there - he said now hear
[2:17:36] you brother now God be merciful to you
[2:17:38] you believe me as a servant you're both
[2:17:41] right now at the verge of being healed I
[2:17:44] can't determine that I can only speak
[2:17:48] what I see and that's the truth so not
[2:17:52] even the preacher can determine it for
[2:17:54] you
[2:17:54] it takes you the individual to believe
[2:17:58] it but you see who determines that not
[2:18:03] God he's already healed - I heal all
[2:18:07] diseases a man and he holds that offer -
[2:18:11] you can't trying to get you to take it
[2:18:14] to accept it hey man now who determines
[2:18:21] that not the devil the Lori said not God
[2:18:24] a man he and neither does the devil he
[2:18:27] doesn't determine either he's lost he's
[2:18:31] a bluff a man he was defeated at Calvary
[2:18:35] he's coming out like he like he's all
[2:18:38] big and bold and
[2:18:39] mad and angry and all of that but he's a
[2:18:42] bluff
[2:18:43] I mean he has no right to be there he's
[2:18:46] bluffing his way to be in your body
[2:18:49] because Jesus said but my structure heal
[2:18:54] but he wants to bluff and say oh no I've
[2:18:57] got a right to be there and he'll try to
[2:18:59] point at something for some failure some
[2:19:01] dis some that something else you some
[2:19:04] reasons what the doctor said somebody
[2:19:06] else died and then something real all of
[2:19:08] these other things of what's going on
[2:19:10] all around and he brings that in your
[2:19:13] mind to war it's you to get you to
[2:19:16] disbelieve but if you can just start
[2:19:20] believing that's the same way with the
[2:19:23] sinner you know a sinner in the
[2:19:25] condition so what I made so many
[2:19:27] mistakes and I've lied and I'm stole and
[2:19:30] I'm committed adultery and I've been a
[2:19:32] bad person I've been a drunkard I've
[2:19:35] been a drug addict I've been on this a
[2:19:36] bit of that and I all this condemnation
[2:19:39] tries to come on you you know there's no
[2:19:41] hope for you you can't make it you get
[2:19:43] but if you listen to the gospel if you
[2:19:46] listen to the word if you listen to the
[2:19:49] voice of the Lord if you feel the angels
[2:19:52] present and start believing it's
[2:19:54] possible it's possible I can be saved I
[2:19:57] can't be delivered I can't be healed
[2:19:59] I can't I can't I can't I can then
[2:20:03] something that happened for you but he's
[2:20:06] gotta change you from doubted you
[2:20:08] believe it say I look the Holy Ghost
[2:20:12] brother Jim but then oh well I tried and
[2:20:14] I didn't get it huh did this not didn't
[2:20:16] get it this happened and I this week
[2:20:19] I've done this forget out of that don't
[2:20:22] listen to the reason strapped in even it
[2:20:25] is for me it's for my children it's for
[2:20:27] those that are far off as far as many as
[2:20:30] the Lord our God shall call a man
[2:20:32] whosoever will
[2:20:33] come the water of life freely who
[2:20:38] determines it you do you do who
[2:20:45] determines the peace if you heart like

[2:21:10] choose you start siding with the angel
[2:21:15] come on the Angels don't confirm the
[2:21:19] message you start believing again he
[2:21:24] says to lady this time on the platform

[2:21:30] God reverently with all your heart the
[2:21:31] rest of your life if God will reveal to
[2:21:34] me your trouble then he said Satan is
[2:21:37] losing his battle polls are coming from
[2:21:40] everywhere faith is moving and the
[2:21:42] buildings becoming milky to me that's
[2:21:44] why he would see faith rising it would
[2:21:46] be it would be like a milky white cloud
[2:21:50] and he would see it his faith and then
[2:21:53] he would see demons is darkness and he

[2:24:00] what it was and then that the ducts free
[2:24:03] streak all left them and it turned light
[2:24:05] the Holy Spirit was moving between them
[2:24:09] what was it something was happening in
[2:24:13] the unseen realm oh man this is the
[2:24:16] point I'm trying to get you to see there
[2:24:18] is an unseen world and it's greater than
[2:24:22] anything you can see a man and this is
[2:24:27] why you would say in this world this
[2:24:30] building there are evil spirits and law
[2:24:33] and Christians are anointed and the
[2:24:37] angels of God and kept about them trying
[2:24:40] to energize them with faith I want to

[2:25:02] energized with faith and here I'm
[2:25:05] standing here just field and myself and
[2:25:08] the holy spirits and move in it and
[2:25:10] that's what you call heavenly places in
[2:25:12] Christ Jesus
[2:25:14] remember Satan's always a skeptic and
[2:25:16] the sons of God he always does someone
[2:25:18] with a skeptic idea when they do that
[2:25:21] and he's just trying to interfere but
[2:25:23] Christians always overcome hallelujah
[2:25:29] hey man my there there's so much of this
[2:25:33] that you could bring but he says in this
[2:25:36] one the audience into our audience looks
[2:25:39] like just a great big milky ball to me
[2:25:42] out there now it's your faith
[2:25:44] oh don't it this is what you got to do
[2:25:51] you're laying there sick in your bed act
[2:25:54] on that faith amen rise up claim the
[2:25:58] promise for yourself say I believe it
[2:26:01] Lord Amen through your doubts away and
[2:26:05] take what God said in his word step
[2:26:07] proclaimer that I'm healed I'm saved I'm
[2:26:10] delivered a man he made a promise and
[2:26:14] this is one thing I know about this God
[2:26:17] he never lies he always tells the truth
[2:26:23] if you can believe it he says spend your
[2:26:26] feet and accept Jesus as your hero now
[2:26:29] regardless of what's wrong with you must
[2:26:32] be the name of the Lord let's raise our
[2:26:34] hands and give Him praise he says every
[2:26:36] one of us O God we think the Lord Satan
[2:26:39] has lost the battle
[2:26:41] Jesus Christ is the winner and we have
[2:26:44] won the victory hallelujah
[2:26:48] that's why ever church service should be
[2:26:50] a veggie not a defeat a victory but a
[2:26:54] defeat for the devil and a victory for
[2:26:57] us because why it stirs our hearts to
[2:27:01] believin
[2:27:04] he said if one comes up platform with
[2:27:08] just an ounce of faith you'll hear
[2:27:11] another one out there screaming for help
[2:27:14] but man it's not what happened with
[2:27:17] Jesus man he started somebody start
[2:27:21] believing and the devil starts screaming
[2:27:23] out of the of that tormented one a man
[2:27:29] screaming for mercy Jesus made him
[2:27:31] scream for mercy a man they they
[2:27:35] screamed that was even willing to go
[2:27:37] into pigs amen anything just don't cast
[2:27:41] a snout or darkness a man he says this
[2:27:46] cancer that this man is facing here
[2:27:49] there's another out there with cancer
[2:27:51] that woman would only believe what I'm
[2:27:53] telling believe Jesus Christ
[2:27:55] she'll be healed as sure as the world
[2:27:58] didn't to throw that woman's faith off
[2:28:01] that other demon screams down in her and
[2:28:04] I catch between them and say there you
[2:28:06] are both of you believe and exposes the
[2:28:09] devil and when he does the devil knows
[2:28:12] he's exposed and he's got to go hey man
[2:28:15] my you see it's really important what we
[2:28:20] listen to in this hour a mountain is it
[2:28:26] now there's a dark streak coming from a
[2:28:28] woman to another
[2:28:30] what is is a devil he knows his time has
[2:28:32] come
[2:28:33] you're extremely nervous aren't you lady
[2:28:35] yes hysterically nervous I've seen
[2:28:38] you're trying to do something you're
[2:28:39] nervous
[2:28:39] mental nervous Satan told you you were
[2:28:42] going to lose your mind if you didn't
[2:28:44] get over it but he lied to you little
[2:28:47] lady back there she's bothered with
[2:28:49] nervousness too and he said this demon
[2:28:51] knows if that woman were halfway believe
[2:28:55] that Jesus Christ the Son of God and I
[2:28:58] miss profit that we'll have to leave her
[2:29:00] and that demon was calling to that one
[2:29:05] for help to help accumulate unbelief but
[2:29:08] he's lost the battle he sure has fear
[2:29:12] faith is
[2:29:13] gathering hallelujah and then when he
[2:29:16] would see faith gathered and and people
[2:29:20] beginning to believe all over he would
[2:29:23] declare Satan he lost the battle a man
[2:29:27] and people would get up of a wheelchairs
[2:29:29] and an out of cops and everything else
[2:29:32] said be healed and walk out of the
[2:29:34] building delivered Wow
[2:29:37] because the battle was won you say it
[2:29:40] was one of Calvary yes it was jesus paid
[2:29:43] it all healing Jesus can heal you he's
[2:29:47] already done it but until you it cannot
[2:29:49] be afforded to you until you start
[2:29:52] believing a man he's saved every one of
[2:29:55] us about what he did at Calvary but
[2:29:58] it'll never do you good until you stop
[2:30:00] believing it
[2:30:01] hey ma'am this is important really
[2:30:05] important because we're talking about
[2:30:08] what's in the unseen right now he says
[2:30:14] they did there's so many much of this
[2:30:17] but I want you to understand the Holy
[2:30:20] Ghost if you have received his Holy
[2:30:23] Spirit it has given you the ability to
[2:30:27] believe I'm telling you you can believe
[2:30:35] you without it you can't truly and fully
[2:30:40] believe it's a work of the Holy Ghost so
[2:30:47] you know we've had great meetings
[2:30:50] revival meetings we had a man that was
[2:30:55] went through the country was a great man
[2:30:58] Billy Graham and many took off after him
[2:31:01] they've done a great work but he this
[2:31:04] was a message of repentance if get out
[2:31:09] what we need is a is a receive a message
[2:31:13] of the infilling remember coz when the
[2:31:17] evil spirit goes out of the mind they're
[2:31:19] walking dry places but then he goes out
[2:31:22] and he finds the house empty and
[2:31:24] garnished and swept he
[2:31:26] comes back in with seven other Devils in
[2:31:28] the last part of the man is worse than
[2:31:30] the first what is it
[2:31:31] he made a good start he started
[2:31:34] repenting but he didn't get filled up
[2:31:35] again it's important to be filled with
[2:31:39] the Spirit of God because once your
[2:31:41] field you're sealed to the day of
[2:31:43] redemption a man and so this will unite
[2:31:48] you under one hand which is Jesus Christ
[2:31:51] and then he will be the leader of your
[2:31:54] battle and you are beyond your own
[2:31:57] anymore trying to fight through this
[2:31:59] nonsense is going on in the world but
[2:32:01] you'll have a leader in your battle
[2:32:03] it'll be the Holy Spirit leading and
[2:32:05] guiding the way for you now I want you
[2:32:12] to know what he did it was like there's
[2:32:17] a legend some say it's true some says it
[2:32:21] has no validity but nevertheless this
[2:32:26] was in many stories in history of a man
[2:32:29] by the name of Arnold von Winkler an
[2:32:35] Arnold von Winkler was a Swiss man and
[2:32:41] one day the opposing the enemy came in
[2:32:46] to the Switzerland into Switzerland and
[2:32:49] there they had they'd formed a thick
[2:32:53] wall with a mass of men and they were
[2:32:57] going through the country ravish and
[2:33:00] killing destroy nah Arnold von Winkler I
[2:33:05] guess that some say it's a legend some
[2:33:07] say it has some truth but it's sketchy
[2:33:10] if you look it up in the in the
[2:33:13] encyclopedia is sketchy but we're just
[2:33:15] going to use it for a story but Arnold
[2:33:20] he looked at his brethren he said rather
[2:33:23] he said you see all of those that big
[2:33:27] wall of that enemy come in and here we
[2:33:31] are we're just farmer and poor people
[2:33:34] and you got a sickle another's got a hoe
[2:33:36] and the others got a you know a piece of
[2:33:39] metal and
[2:33:40] if you have a sword and hardly nobody
[2:33:42] has this fear but said this day I've
[2:33:45] decided I'm gonna give my life for
[2:33:49] Switzerland so what are you gonna do
[2:33:52] Arnold he said well I kiss my wife and
[2:33:55] children goodbye this morning he said
[2:33:58] because I've got to make a way for
[2:34:00] Liberty he says I want you to come with
[2:34:06] me because I'm gonna make a hole through
[2:34:09] this this wall of men and he says I want
[2:34:13] you to follow behind me in the hole that
[2:34:16] I make and I want you to fight with
[2:34:17] everything you got and then they said
[2:34:21] that Arnold took off on a run toward
[2:34:25] that enemy and he ran with everything he
[2:34:28] had and those men with all the spears
[2:34:31] whenever they aimed at their Arnold and
[2:34:33] he took him to his business Muslim all
[2:34:35] the Spears and swords and hits and there
[2:34:38] and that confused and the Swiss the
[2:34:41] Swiss man come revetted behind him
[2:34:43] because they were so taken by his
[2:34:45] voluntary in this and his braveness and
[2:34:47] they come in there and they the
[2:34:49] enemy and broke through the hole and
[2:34:51] destroyed the army and had freedom for
[2:34:53] years and years in their country but let
[2:34:58] me tell you of another great hero not
[2:35:01] great hero he saw that we were walled
[2:35:05] off as human beings Satan had us
[2:35:09] garrisoned had a great wall of fear and
[2:35:12] death and doubt that one our Savior
[2:35:17] Jesus Christ looked at that wall and he
[2:35:21] said this day I'd give my life for my
[2:35:24] people make way for liberty now you take
[2:35:28] what you've got in fight with all you
[2:35:31] have and he went running toward the
[2:35:34] enemy and he took death into his bosom
[2:35:37] he took scamper into his bosom he took
[2:35:39] sickness into the bosom he took every
[2:35:42] kind of disease that there was and
[2:35:44] sickness and everything lies and
[2:35:47] fornication and adultery it is
[2:35:49] and the routed Satan's army man and all
[2:35:54] you've got to do is go forth and claim
[2:35:56] your victory this Lord amen because he
[2:36:00] is the one who paid the before the
[2:36:03] battle and he took the sphere and you
[2:36:05] are free this morning to accept your
[2:36:07] Liberty
[2:36:08] he made that Liberty now walk in that
[2:36:11] freedom in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:36:15] where you believe let's bow our heads
[2:36:19] together would you why you have your
[2:36:23] heads bowed while you're talking to the
[2:36:28] Lord just for a moment
[2:36:30] maybe I've talked about things that are
[2:36:32] really strange and different because a
[2:36:36] lot of people are talking about what
[2:36:37] they're seeing in the scene world and
[2:36:39] I'm talking about what's going on in the
[2:36:40] unseen but I'm asking you can you open
[2:36:50] that door this morning
[2:36:55] can we start getting your faith can we
[2:36:58] start getting you to believe sins no
[2:37:06] harder for God than anything else
[2:37:10] he specializes and things thought
[2:37:12] impossible you need Jesus once you just
[2:37:17] reach a hand out to him and say Lord I
[2:37:18] need you I'm going to start believing

[2:37:51] sin will take you to hell
[2:37:55] cancer can't take you to hell
[2:38:00] only your sin can do it but if you got
[2:38:09] cancer this morning
[2:38:10] you got sickness in your body and I said
[2:38:16] cancer maybe it's maybe you're infected
[2:38:20] with the virus and maybe that's now
[2:38:23] feared worse than cancer it's bad news
[2:38:27] you don't know what the outcome is but
[2:38:34] if I get you to start believing
[2:38:36] [Music]

[2:41:32] unseen dimensions and touched us servant
[2:41:36] li and their dead or dying and healed

[2:41:43] woman when he saw how great her faith
[2:41:51] was and was persistent to believe even
[2:41:56] when Jesus said it ain't right to give
[2:41:59] the children's bread that's divine
[2:42:01] healing to the dogs of Gentiles

[2:45:59] are possible Jesus is he give me Isaiah
[2:46:08] nine and six just for a moment scripture
[2:46:12] says that unto us a child is born unto
[2:46:17] us a son is given and the government
[2:46:21] shall be upon his shoulder and his name
[2:46:24] shall be called wonderful counsellor the
[2:46:29] mighty God the everlasting father the
[2:46:32] Prince of Peace this is a wonderful
[2:46:39] scripture that we look at this morning
[2:46:41] as we prepare for baptism baptism is
[2:46:45] really important part of our salvation
[2:46:48] we know the thief at the cross as far as
[2:46:52] we know he wasn't baptized but for us it
[2:46:57] can that have an opportunity we must
[2:47:00] obey the word and the Bible said he that
[2:47:04] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[2:47:05] and he that believeth not shall be
[2:47:07] damned
[2:47:10] [Music]
[2:47:15] we're just looking at this scripture is
[2:47:17] God revealed itself down to the ages he
[2:47:20] would be known as Jehovah he would be
[2:47:24] Jehovah Jireh the Lord provider Jehovah
[2:47:27] Rapha the Lord healer Jehovah Shalom the
[2:47:32] Lord is our peace
[2:47:36] he would be known in jehova shamma the
[2:47:42] Lord is present all these expressions of
[2:47:46] Jehovah
[2:47:47] but one day Jehovah coming to come flesh
[2:47:52] and in doing so there was a new
[2:47:57] expression to the name Jehovah and that
[2:48:01] was Jehovah Savior and that is what
[2:48:07] Jesus means it's the Greek form of
[2:48:10] Yeshua which means Jehovah the saviours
[2:48:13] were God came as Savior we look back
[2:48:17] here at Isaiah 9 and 6 it says unto us a
[2:48:21] child is born and us a son is given and
[2:48:24] his name shall be called these will be
[2:48:27] the titles that he will go by all of
[2:48:30] these he will fulfill he will be
[2:48:33] wonderful which means the miracle
[2:48:37] wonderful means the miracle he'll be the
[2:48:39] wonderful the miracle he would be born
[2:48:43] of a virgin the miracle he'd be awesome
[2:48:49] wonderful his name would be called
[2:48:52] wonderful
[2:48:54] we called counselor he's the one who
[2:48:59] will lead us guide us direct us he be
[2:49:04] called the mighty God this is God comes
[2:49:09] from the word el al in the Old Testament
[2:49:12] Hebrew mighty is gabor he would be the
[2:49:18] mighty God are the El Gabor which means
[2:49:25] he would be the warrior God Gabor is a
[2:49:29] mighty man a warrior and this is where
[2:49:32] God would come on taking on human
[2:49:34] battles he couldn't do it as spirit for
[2:49:37] him in the heavens so God came to the
[2:49:39] earth and he came in Jesus and his name
[2:49:46] would be called though Helga bore the
[2:49:50] mighty God he'd also be known as the
[2:49:53] everlasting father and the Prince of
[2:49:58] Peace these are not his names
[2:50:01] this is just what his name in tells his
[2:50:06] name would be called Jesus and the angel
[2:50:11] said and his name shall be called Jesus
[2:50:15] for he shall save his people from their
[2:50:19] sins
[2:50:19] [Music]
[2:50:22] now he told us Matthew would write it
[2:50:28] this way and this would be his account
[2:50:30] in Matthew 28:19 he would also tell us
[2:50:37] of titles of his name and the Bible says
[2:50:43] go ye therefore and teach all nations
[2:50:44] baptizing them in the name singular
[2:50:49] we just read and Isaiah nine and six
[2:50:52] many names but his name shall be called
[2:50:56] this his name these are his titles
[2:51:01] father son Holy Ghost father he is a
[2:51:08] creator of the earth but then out of
[2:51:14] himself he speaks and brings a baby into
[2:51:17] a mother's womb and God
[2:51:23] stepped out into human flesh and that
[2:51:25] was called the Sun because it was
[2:51:29] birthed of the eternal spirit and the
[2:51:34] Holy Ghost is who he is
[2:51:36] just like the Joe your father you have
[2:51:43] these two children your son you have a
[2:51:45] mother and dad your name is and father
[2:51:48] your name isn't son you're also human
[2:51:50] but your name isn't human your name is
[2:51:53] Jill Adams he told us to go and baptize
[2:51:56] them in the name not name's not titles
[2:52:02] there are other titles his name of
[2:52:04] lily-of-the-valley bright morning star
[2:52:06] as we read counselor principies mighty
[2:52:11] god these are all titles of his deity
[2:52:16] but he has a name the name of the father
[2:52:19] is Jesus there is no salvation given in
[2:52:24] any other name than in the name of Jesus
[2:52:27] whatever we do in word or deed we do in
[2:52:30] the name of Jesus Acts chapter 2 verse
[2:52:32] 38 I'd like you to look at that let's
[2:52:36] just read this
[2:52:38] the Holy Ghost it fell and people were
[2:52:41] pricked in their heart wanted to know
[2:52:43] what must we do to be saved
[2:52:45] and he told him repent that's what you
[2:52:49] got to do believe on the Lord repent of
[2:52:51] your sins and then be baptized
[2:52:58] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[2:53:01] racing of sins and you shall receive the
[2:53:04] gift of the Holy Ghost do you know there
[2:53:07] was never one time in all of history and
[2:53:10] all the Bible that anybody was ever
[2:53:12] baptized in any other way than in the
[2:53:15] name of Jesus Christ we're gonna baptize
[2:53:19] you today in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:53:23] because today you are taking on his name
[2:53:27] you see all the family in heaven Earth
[2:53:30] has to be named after when you're born
[2:53:34] again when you were born your mom and
[2:53:37] dad gave you a name and when you're born

[2:53:53] Jesus and you've asked Jesus to come in
[2:53:56] your heart you want to obey Him today

[2:54:02] love the Lord Jesus from now on you
[2:54:04] serve him with all your heart okay we're
[2:54:07] gonna pray together father in the name
[2:54:09] of Jesus as these parents bring their
[2:54:13] children north today and they immerse

[2:54:19] they take on your name may Lord you do
[2:54:22] what we cannot do like John the Baptist
[2:54:24] said he was the Baptizer he said i
[2:54:27] baptize you with water but he that comes
[2:54:29] after me will baptize you with the Holy
[2:54:31] Ghost and fire I pray the same way for
[2:54:34] these children we're gonna baptize them
[2:54:36] in water but it'll take you to baptize
[2:54:39] them with the Holy Ghost and fire you do
[2:54:43] what we can't do
[2:54:44] I pray you guard over him all the days
[2:54:46] of their lives Lord bless these children
[2:54:49] that's come to you you said to us allow
[2:54:51] little children to come to me and forbid
