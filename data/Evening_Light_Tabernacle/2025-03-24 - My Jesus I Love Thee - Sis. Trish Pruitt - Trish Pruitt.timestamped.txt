[0:00] [Music]
[0:16] My
[0:17] [Music]
[0:20] Jesus, I love thee.
[0:25] I
[0:25] know
[0:27] thou art
[0:31] mine for
[0:34] thee. Oh, the
[0:38] [Music]
[0:40] follyies of
[0:42] sin.
[0:44] I resign.
[0:48] My
[0:51] gracious
[0:55] redeemer, my
[0:59] savior, art thou.
[1:02] [Music]
[1:04] If
[1:07] ever I love
[1:11] thee, my
[1:15] Jesus is
[1:18] now and I
[1:21] love
[1:23] thee
[1:25] because
[1:27] thou hast
[1:29] first love
[1:34] me and have
[1:38] purchased my
[1:42] [Music]
[1:46] partners tree.
[1:50] I
[1:52] love thee for
[1:57] wearing the
[1:59] thorns
[2:01] on thy brow.
[2:05] If
[2:09] ever I love
[2:12] thee, my
[2:16] Jesus is
[2:20] now. I will
[2:22] love
[2:24] thee in life.
[2:28] I
[2:30] love
[2:32] thee in death.
[2:36] And I will
[2:38] praise
[2:39] thee as long
[2:43] as thou
[2:47] lendest me
[2:51] breath and
[2:53] say when the
[2:56] death
[2:59] do
[3:01] hold on
[3:04] my brow.
[3:07] If
[3:10] ever I love
[3:14] thee, my
[3:17] Jesus is
[3:21] now
[3:25] in
[3:29] glory and
[3:31] [Music]
[3:33] in delight.
[3:37] or I'll
[3:40] ever
[3:42] adore
[3:44] thee in
[3:48] heaven so
[3:51] bright. I'll
[3:54] sing with the
[3:59] glittering
[4:01] crown
[4:03] on my brow.
[4:08] If
[4:10] ever I love
[4:14] thee, my
[4:18] Jesus is now.
[4:22] [Music]
[4:25] [Applause]
