[40:42] the devil don't like
[40:44] amen we only care what he he won't say
[40:47] man
[40:48] joshua 3 and verse 9 it says and joshua
[40:51] said unto the children of israel come
[40:53] hither
[40:54] and hear the words of the lord your god
[40:56] and joshua said hereby you shall know
[40:59] that the living god
[41:00] is among you and that he will without
[41:03] fail
[41:04] drive out from before you the canaanites
[41:07] the hittites the hivites
[41:09] the perizzites the girgishites the
[41:11] amorites and the jebusites
[41:14] behold the ark of the covenant of the
[41:16] lord of all the earth passed over before
[41:18] you unto jordan
[41:20] now therefore take ye twelve men out of
[41:22] the tribes of israel
[41:23] out of every tribe of man and it shall
[41:26] come to pass
[41:27] as soon as the souls of the feet of the
[41:29] priests that bear the ark of the lord
[41:32] the lord of all the earth shall rest in
[41:34] the waters of the jordan
[41:35] that the waters of the jordan shall be
[41:37] cut off from the waters that come down
[41:39] from above
[41:40] and they shall stand upon a heap and it
[41:43] came to pass
[41:44] when the people removed from their tents
[41:46] to pass over jordan
[41:48] that the priests bear in the ark of the
[41:49] covenant before the people
[41:52] and and as they were that bear the ark
[41:55] were coming to jordan
[41:57] the feet of the priests that bear the
[41:59] ark were dipped
[42:00] in the brim of the water for jordan
[42:02] overfloweth all its banks
[42:04] all the time of harvest that the waters
[42:08] which came down from above
[42:09] stood and rose up upon a heap very far
[42:12] from the city adam
[42:14] that is beside zerotan and those that
[42:17] came down toward the sea of the plain
[42:19] even the salt sea
[42:20] failed and were cut off and the people
[42:23] passed right
[42:24] against jericho and this priest that
[42:27] bear the ark of the covenant lord stood
[42:29] firm on dry ground in the midst of the
[42:32] jordan
[42:33] and all the israelites passed over dry
[42:35] ground
[42:36] until all the people were passed clean
[42:38] over
[42:39] jordan amen we let you be seated this
[42:43] evening
[42:50] i just want to speak to you for a moment
[42:52] on step into the water
[42:55] step into the water it was very
[42:58] interesting that once again
[43:00] god would do something that he had done
[43:02] before but maybe in a different way
[43:05] but he would open up the sea of or the
[43:07] river of jordan as he did the sea of
[43:10] of the red sea and we know we could go
[43:12] back in the book of joshua as he would
[43:14] begin to deal with joshua in the joshua
[43:17] commission he would he would say there
[43:19] in chapter one in verse two moses my
[43:21] servant is dead now therefore rise
[43:23] and go over this jordan thou and all
[43:26] this people into the land which i do
[43:28] give unto them
[43:29] even to this children of israel and
[43:32] every place that the soul of your feet
[43:34] shall tread upon
[43:35] that i have given to you as i said unto
[43:38] moses
[43:38] from the wilderness and to the lebanon
[43:41] even of the great river the river
[43:43] euphrates all the land of the hittites
[43:45] unto the great sea
[43:47] toward the going down of the sun shall
[43:49] be your coast
[43:50] there shall not any man be able to stand
[43:53] before thee
[43:54] all the days of thy life as i was with
[43:57] moses
[43:58] so i will be with thee i will not fail
[44:01] thee nor forsake thee
[44:02] be strong and of good courage for unto
[44:04] this people shalt thou divide an
[44:06] inheritance of land which i swear unto
[44:09] their fathers to give them only be thou
[44:11] strong and very courageous
[44:14] you know i think it's amazing that he
[44:16] would tell joshua this as i was with
[44:18] moses
[44:19] so i shall be with thee he's showing
[44:21] joshua that he's still the same
[44:23] yesterday today and forever
[44:25] amen just because the prophet of god has
[44:27] left the scene does not mean god has
[44:29] left the scene
[44:30] that god is still on the throne god is
[44:32] still moving among his people
[44:34] it does not matter what the circumstance
[44:36] may say or how
[44:37] how much evil is around us or what's all
[44:40] happening around us
[44:41] it does not mean that god is not around
[44:43] us or god is not looking or god is not
[44:45] aware
[44:46] but god is very aware of our situation
[44:48] that we're facing this time that we're
[44:50] living in
[44:51] and he was telling joshua i am aware of
[44:53] what you're where you're at
[44:54] i know exactly on the map where you're
[44:56] standing and i have i know about the
[44:59] jordan river i know about the flood i
[45:02] know about all that's going on but this
[45:04] is the time
[45:05] to go step into the water this is a time
[45:08] to make a move amen why did god ask for
[45:10] them to step in the water
[45:12] you know he could have dried it up he
[45:13] could have he could have stopped it on
[45:15] his own he could have done it before
[45:17] they ever made
[45:18] the first move but why did god ask them
[45:20] to do that he wanted them to exhibit
[45:22] faith that what he said that what he
[45:25] said
[45:26] they believed amen that it was they
[45:28] didn't just believe in a god of history
[45:30] but they believed in a god that was
[45:32] present they didn't believe in a god who
[45:34] could but they believed in a god who
[45:35] would
[45:36] they didn't believe in just a god who
[45:38] maybe could do something in a time far
[45:40] away
[45:40] beyond in history as they were told no
[45:42] doubt by their fathers and their mothers
[45:44] that they could cut that they were told
[45:46] about the red sea crossing and how
[45:48] god came in a mighty way and it was a
[45:50] mighty amen revival that took place and
[45:52] they could tell about it all
[45:54] and they could tell about how they came
[45:56] down to that red sea and
[45:57] it seemed impossible there's mountains
[45:59] on one side and egyptians on another
[46:01] side
[46:02] and it seemed like they were going to
[46:03] die there in the wilderness but god
[46:05] began to move
[46:06] amen upon the people and upon the
[46:08] prophet moses and he would tell moses
[46:10] speak and go forward and you know and
[46:12] you can read about some of the history
[46:14] they would talk about
[46:15] as they heard the word of god speak and
[46:17] go forward there was a certain
[46:19] this was written down in some of their
[46:20] history there was certain tribe
[46:22] certain family of a tribe that would
[46:24] hear that word and they would go into
[46:26] the water and they
[46:27] they would press out into there even
[46:28] until it got up to almost their nostrils
[46:31] but they believed the same god that did
[46:33] all those things to the egyptians
[46:35] was still god right there and they were
[46:37] willing to prove that he is the same
[46:39] yesterday today and forever
[46:40] by taking that step of faith and here we
[46:43] are now in joshua's day now god
[46:45] is amazing the humor or or the maybe the
[46:48] wisdom of god however you would like to
[46:50] look at it
[46:50] that god would wait to seemingly the
[46:52] worst time and he would wait to simulate
[46:54] the most impossible
[46:56] circumstances that it would be
[46:57] impossible to cross the jordan river
[46:59] but god works in impossibilities amen as
[47:02] we heard many sermons brother joe's been
[47:04] preaching on
[47:05] god does impossible math that god an
[47:08] impossible situation
[47:10] will move it right out of your way amen
[47:12] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye if
[47:14] you're willing to take that step of
[47:16] faith
[47:16] amen here they are and you know why
[47:19] would he ask him to do this he wanted to
[47:21] see their faith
[47:22] it was at flood stage the water was at
[47:24] its highest and you know
[47:25] it seems today that that sin is at its
[47:28] peak
[47:29] it seems today that sickness is
[47:31] everywhere it seems today that the world
[47:33] is at its worst it's ever been
[47:35] it seemed like sickness is is like a
[47:37] flood that's coming in on every side
[47:40] but he's looking for a people a royal
[47:42] priesthood
[47:43] a holy nation a peculiar people that's
[47:46] willing to take a step of faith
[47:49] that's willing to stay step right in the
[47:51] middle of all that flood
[47:52] right in the middle of all that
[47:54] situation and say though god slay me yet
[47:56] i'll trust him
[47:58] i know he's got the answer for every
[47:59] sickness i know he's got the answer for
[48:01] every disease
[48:02] i know he's got the answer for every sin
[48:05] i know he's got the answer for every
[48:06] devil
[48:07] i know he's got the answer for
[48:08] everything the devil can try to bring
[48:10] into this realm there's demons on top of
[48:13] demons being poured into here
[48:14] but there is a standard that's being
[48:16] raised up there is a word that has been
[48:19] spoken amen go into the promised land
[48:23] because the devil tries to wall up amen
[48:25] something is very good
[48:26] brother branham would talk about
[48:28] scarecrows we spoke on that how he put
[48:30] scarecrows around something you'd put
[48:32] something
[48:32] around maybe you know as we're getting
[48:34] ready for spring thank god for spring is
[48:36] coming on and
[48:37] and you're looking at planting corn or
[48:39] plant tomatoes
[48:40] you might put something out there to
[48:42] keep the birds away but why are you
[48:43] doing that
[48:44] because there's something there amen
[48:46] that's very precious
[48:48] and the devil you know wants to put
[48:49] scarecrows or to bring the river at a
[48:52] flood stage
[48:53] and corona had us worse and sickness had
[48:55] his word
[48:56] and demonic pressure is at its worst and
[48:58] every kind of spirit
[48:59] at its worst but it's only showing you
[49:01] right behind that
[49:03] it's something very precious right
[49:05] behind all of that
[49:06] is the word of god the promises of god
[49:09] that we are more than able to take
[49:11] [Applause]
[49:13] amen i believe that there's a people on
[49:15] the earth today that's like joshua and
[49:17] caleb
[49:17] that'll look towards them giants and say
[49:19] giants you're coming down
[49:21] walls you're coming down doubt you're
[49:23] coming down
[49:24] unbelief you're coming down fear you're
[49:26] coming down
[49:27] every spirit that's tried to hold the
[49:29] bride of jesus christ
[49:31] you're coming down why because there's a
[49:33] people of faith
[49:34] to step into the water amen to step into
[49:38] the water
[49:39] i believe he's calling the people out of
[49:41] their out of their
[49:42] uh places where they feel amen very
[49:45] comfortable
[49:47] ain't it amazing he's made it you know
[49:49] we we keep getting the questions i our
[49:51] the statement i like to just feel normal
[49:53] again
[49:55] do you think it felt normal for them to
[49:57] walk into the water
[49:59] at flood stage do you think that was a
[50:00] normal feeling amen to walk out in the
[50:03] middle of that flood what it seemed to
[50:04] be
[50:04] it would surely drown them and would
[50:07] kill them that that wasn't very normal
[50:09] that wasn't normal thinking to do
[50:10] something like that it was but it was
[50:12] god's thinking
[50:15] amen god had put the word there and god
[50:17] said i'm going to
[50:18] show you amen that there is a living god
[50:21] among you
[50:23] hallelujah why has he allowed it to be
[50:26] thus
[50:27] why is he allowed it to break us out of
[50:29] our comfort zones and
[50:30] out of our normality of life he's
[50:32] wanting to show you it's not you that's
[50:34] doing the work
[50:35] but there's a living god among you
[50:39] hallelujah there is a god here that can
[50:41] heal coronavirus
[50:44] i know i know the devil wants to make
[50:45] you think that everybody's dying from it
[50:47] and it's so bad and so weak and then it
[50:49] is but there is a god there is a blood
[50:52] there is a healer that'll destroy that
[50:54] thing
[50:54] and send it back to hell where it came
[50:56] from
[51:00] there's a blood there's a power
[51:04] amen he's looking for a people that's
[51:07] willing to move into higher heights
[51:09] and deeper depths amen to believe for
[51:12] the impossibilities
[51:16] amen it's not hard to believe for a loaf
[51:17] of bread when there's 25
[51:19] or 100 loaves of bread on on a on a
[51:22] shelf somewhere
[51:23] it ain't hard to believe for milk or or
[51:25] whatever substantial things for life
[51:27] and when it's all laying there before
[51:29] you amen it ain't hard to believe for
[51:32] for amen for healing when you're well
[51:36] amen it ain't any hard to believe for
[51:38] amen for some things when you've got
[51:40] them right among you but when they all
[51:42] all seem to be away from you and it
[51:44] seems like a flood all around you
[51:46] and the enemies come on every side then
[51:48] that's when you've got to believe
[51:50] that he's still the same today
[51:53] hallelujah when the enemy comes in like
[51:56] a flood
[51:57] amen he's flooding into every fabric of
[52:00] society
[52:01] he's flooding in with every doubt and
[52:03] every unbelief
[52:04] every critic is flooding him
[52:08] seem like they're everywhere hell's been
[52:10] opened up
[52:12] every spirit is coming to this realm
[52:15] demons upon demons
[52:17] are being released but he said
[52:20] when that happens i'll raise up a
[52:21] standard
[52:24] when sickness floods in i'll raise up
[52:26] the blood of jesus
[52:28] not me he has
[52:32] when the enemy comes in it's flooding
[52:35] every kind of direction
[52:37] amen there's a but there's a people that
[52:40] are bound for a promised land
[52:42] they're bound for heavenly realms
[52:46] amen amen i know one day we're going to
[52:49] take a rapture i'm talking about even
[52:50] right now
[52:51] in satan's eden there's a people bound
[52:53] for heavenly realms
[52:56] amen that they can have a heavenly
[52:57] atmosphere around them
[52:59] in the middle of satan's eden in the
[53:01] middle of all of
[53:02] his flooding and all of his spirits
[53:04] that's coming on every hand
[53:06] there's a people that can live in a
[53:07] heavenly realm
[53:10] but it took faith it took to believe
[53:13] that god
[53:14] the same god that opened the red sea is
[53:16] still god
[53:22] and he don't change
[53:29] we can look at the red sea what did he
[53:30] do the song says he made a sea
[53:32] into a highway man we're living in time
[53:38] in our in our little little state
[53:39] louisiana get a little
[53:41] 11 inch 12 inch whatever kind of snow
[53:43] you can't move for several days
[53:47] you know i don't have the equipment to
[53:49] deal with understand all of that
[53:50] but it don't take much to make man men
[53:53] immobile
[53:55] all their plans and all their wants and
[53:57] all the how to how to
[53:58] and it just immobilizes them i mean a
[54:00] little snow
[54:02] mess them right up amen i you know
[54:06] they think well i'm gonna go do this
[54:07] today nope got snow today
[54:09] i'm gonna do that that's how little man
[54:11] is
[54:13] that a little flake of snow can fall on
[54:15] the ground they can't go nowhere
[54:17] that's how little man and i know they
[54:18] whether we can have machines we can do
[54:20] this
[54:20] and they get it but it's the point is it
[54:23] don't take much to make man where they
[54:25] can't do anything
[54:27] even though men thinks they got it all
[54:29] figured out and we're all smart and we
[54:31] got this
[54:32] but that we and we're nothing we're
[54:34] we're nothing compared to his
[54:36] intelligence
[54:38] and you know it was maybe people trying
[54:40] to figure out why is he sending us out
[54:42] in the middle of a flood why is he
[54:45] sending us in the
[54:46] in the time it seems to be the worst
[54:48] timing
[54:50] it wasn't but just a few months ago it
[54:52] wasn't hardly a trickle
[54:53] but now look at it he was wanting to
[54:56] show them a living god
[54:58] is still among you hallelujah
[55:01] why is god allowed all kind of sickness
[55:04] to be poured out in every demonic
[55:06] spirit amen it seemed like it had been a
[55:07] lot easier to take a rapture
[55:09] maybe a hundred years ago but he's
[55:11] allowed it to come into this wow
[55:13] he's wanting to show the whole world
[55:15] there is a people
[55:17] with a living god among them
[55:21] i don't know it's more than a song but
[55:23] it's the truth
[55:24] he walks among us
[55:27] performing his word doing exactly what
[55:30] he said hallelujah
[55:35] crossing right over on dry land
[55:39] right over on tri-land and here the
[55:42] egyptians think they're going to follow
[55:44] them
[55:44] and they go right into the red sea right
[55:46] after them listen when god prepares you
[55:49] away
[55:49] he's preparing the devil a trap
[55:53] hallelujah amen and this we know what
[55:56] happened the sea fell in on them
[55:59] and he who did it before we'll do it
[56:02] again
[56:05] it looks like a flood all around us
[56:06] brother timothy but don't forget the
[56:08] standard
[56:12] it looks like a lot of enemy around us
[56:14] but don't forget the living god among us
[56:17] well brother timothy you've seen the
[56:19] canaanites and the hittites and the
[56:20] cancer and
[56:21] and the sugar diabetes and the high
[56:23] blood pressure and the demons of
[56:25] complexes and doubts and fear
[56:26] have you seen all of them i ain't
[56:28] looking at none of them i'm looking at a
[56:30] living card
[56:31] and a living god who has a living word
[56:33] with living signs and wonders
[56:36] that'll take a man who says he's only
[56:39] got four months to live
[56:40] and now he's still living today define a
[56:43] man's decree

[57:06] the last say
[57:07] he tried to say he was a druggie and an
[57:09] alcohol
[57:10] and no good for nothing but god said
[57:12] that's not who he
[57:13] is that's not who she is that's my son
[57:17] and my daughter

[1:02:09] i've said many times he told him i'll
[1:02:10] take you out
[1:02:11] and i'll take you in did you hear him in
[1:02:15] that mention the red sea
[1:02:17] no water no no no food
[1:02:20] did you hear him mention any of that
[1:02:22] about you know these sicknesses and
[1:02:24] different
[1:02:24] did you hear him mention any of that
[1:02:27] because he's not worried about that
[1:02:29] his word said i'm taking you out and i'm
[1:02:31] taking you in
[1:02:34] god's not concerned about all the mess
[1:02:35] in the middle like we are
[1:02:37] we get concerned about what's in the
[1:02:39] middle what we need to focus on he took
[1:02:40] me out
[1:02:41] and the same god that took me out of sin
[1:02:44] the same god that lifted me up out of
[1:02:46] complexes
[1:02:47] and unbelief and every kind of thing
[1:02:48] that tried to hold itself on me
[1:02:50] amen every spirit of hell he took me out
[1:02:53] of it
[1:02:53] he if he was big enough to do that and
[1:02:56] he was
[1:02:57] then he's big enough to do what else he
[1:02:59] said he said i'm going gonna take you in
[1:03:02] i'll not leave you or forsake you but
[1:03:04] i'll be with you to the end of the world
[1:03:06] this god is big enough
[1:03:10] don't get your eyes off of your big god
[1:03:20] but i don't like being out of my comfort
[1:03:21] zone we might ought to get used to
[1:03:23] different
[1:03:24] preach i don't i don't know i don't know
[1:03:28] what
[1:03:29] comfort anymore people are saying well i
[1:03:32] can't you know they always i can't wait
[1:03:34] till 2020 gets over with
[1:03:36] well 2021 ain't started off too good
[1:03:42] we don't know what it's going to be
[1:03:46] i feel like it's going to continue to
[1:03:48] get worse
[1:03:50] because it's heading towards destruction
[1:03:53] amen
[1:03:54] but it takes a stepping out in faith it
[1:03:57] means
[1:03:58] trust that step but step out means trust
[1:04:00] god for whatever comes next
[1:04:02] you know as peter as he would come to
[1:04:04] that moment in that boat
[1:04:06] and he would see jesus walking on the
[1:04:07] water
[1:04:09] and and he he came up and he walked on
[1:04:12] the water
[1:04:13] he said well you see jesus what he says
[1:04:15] they like is that a spirit what is that
[1:04:17] out there
[1:04:18] and this peter looked at him and said
[1:04:19] lord if that be you
[1:04:21] bid me come you know what jesus said
[1:04:28] did he say come and peter you can walk
[1:04:29] right to me you won't have a lick of
[1:04:32] problems
[1:04:33] it's going to it's already done just
[1:04:35] come on peter you just walk on
[1:04:37] no he just said come and peter had the
[1:04:40] faith to step out
[1:04:43] and he stepped out on the water and he
[1:04:44] began to walk towards jesus but we know
[1:04:46] the story what happened
[1:04:47] all of a sudden he got to look he wait a
[1:04:49] minute i don't lift the boat
[1:04:52] i lost my mind well
[1:04:55] and the very thing that i was dependent
[1:04:57] upon for safety is now no longer i can't
[1:04:59] grab it no more and it's gone
[1:05:01] and i can't hold it it's not normal
[1:05:03] anymore
[1:05:06] listen god knows how to kick the
[1:05:07] training wheels out from under you
[1:05:10] amen god knows how to make it very
[1:05:11] uncomfortable sometimes
[1:05:13] and you get in some uncomfortable places
[1:05:15] but don't forget in those places he's
[1:05:17] still there
[1:05:19] he's still watching over you and he's
[1:05:21] still taking care of you he hasn't left
[1:05:23] us
[1:05:24] yes hallelujah i know right now
[1:05:27] some are wondering what in the world you
[1:05:29] know
[1:05:32] you know we now have several people that
[1:05:34] apparently i'm just going to say
[1:05:37] tested positive for kobe twice i don't
[1:05:39] know if they did but they didn't
[1:05:41] i don't know what to believe anymore as
[1:05:42] far as men things go
[1:05:45] but i know peter walked on water two
[1:05:47] times
[1:05:49] and if he'd have went down he'd walked
[1:05:50] on three times
[1:05:52] because jesus was with him and he was a
[1:05:54] son of god
[1:05:55] and there wasn't no going down in defeat
[1:05:59] hallelujah the same god that made you
[1:06:01] walk one time will make you walk again
[1:06:03] and again and again the same god that
[1:06:06] healed you one time
[1:06:07] will heal you again and again and again
[1:06:10] and again he is the same yesterday today
[1:06:13] and forever
[1:06:16] hallelujah he is the god and he changes
[1:06:20] not
[1:06:21] [Applause]
[1:06:25] it takes faith
[1:06:28] daniel had to step out into a lion's den
[1:06:32] he had to make steps amen they said you
[1:06:35] pray to god you pray to another you
[1:06:36] won't get thrown in the lion's den
[1:06:38] he just went ahead and bowed us and he
[1:06:39] bowed down and prayed right just knew he
[1:06:41] knew what was going to come
[1:06:43] but he wasn't that well he wasn't under
[1:06:45] a man's decree he was under the decree
[1:06:47] of god
[1:06:49] but in that moment god came down as they
[1:06:51] throwed him into the lion's den
[1:06:53] and it seemed like it got worse i don't
[1:06:55] think that would be normal place to
[1:06:57] spend the night in the lion's den
[1:06:59] it didn't feel normal
[1:07:03] it seemed like death on every corner
[1:07:05] hanging around every
[1:07:06] every little place was death
[1:07:09] daniel gets thrown in there and he's
[1:07:11] dusting himself off and them lines are
[1:07:13] looking like they're coming up for
[1:07:14] amen to get them a good old midday snack
[1:07:17] or midnight snack whatever time it was
[1:07:19] but all of a sudden presence of god the
[1:07:23] angels of god fell in that place
[1:07:25] but what took that to get to that place
[1:07:28] was a step of faith
[1:07:31] a step of faith believing that the god
[1:07:34] who called me to this place
[1:07:36] is going to take care of me no matter
[1:07:37] what situation i go through
[1:07:41] three hebrew children it took a step bow
[1:07:44] they said nope here's their step
[1:07:46] nope will not bow
[1:07:49] that step took them closer and closer
[1:07:52] amen down to a fire
[1:07:53] and looked like destruction to men's
[1:07:56] eyes they thought they was going to die
[1:07:58] maybe in their own eyes they thought
[1:07:59] well
[1:08:00] if we die so be it but live forever o
[1:08:02] king we're not going to bow
[1:08:05] and they get thrown into a fiery furnace
[1:08:07] what happens the fourth man came down
[1:08:10] god is orchestrating this whole
[1:08:12] situation
[1:08:14] we're in tonight and today and for
[1:08:16] whatever times left on this earth
[1:08:18] to show you there's still a fourth man
[1:08:21] to show you as we've heard they're still
[1:08:23] angels all around us ministering spirits
[1:08:26] moving on our hearts moving on our knees
[1:08:28] healing our lives
[1:08:31] they're still here among us but it takes
[1:08:34] floods of waters
[1:08:37] and it takes somebody willing to step in
[1:08:46] brother branham would say this and
[1:08:48] talking about ellie's are going after
[1:08:49] rebecca
[1:08:50] and i believe that's that's who he was
[1:08:53] eliezer
[1:08:55] ordained of god to go get a bride for
[1:08:58] isaac
[1:08:59] yes eliezer when he had the assurance
[1:09:02] that the angel was with him and that he
[1:09:05] could go and it would go before him he
[1:09:07] decided to go
[1:09:08] because he had something to back him up
[1:09:11] he said i think that ought to be the
[1:09:12] assurance of every man of god that
[1:09:14] preaches the gospel
[1:09:15] that got something positive from god
[1:09:17] that'll back up what he preaches
[1:09:19] if you haven't got it brother it's for
[1:09:21] you
[1:09:23] god still sends men with an angel
[1:09:27] hello somebody god still sends men with
[1:09:30] an angel before him
[1:09:31] when he goes to take a message to the
[1:09:33] church not only that but when eliezer
[1:09:35] left the father of isaac
[1:09:37] which represented the father of christ
[1:09:39] he loaded the whole train of camels with
[1:09:41] good gifts for the bride oh
[1:09:43] he said i feel religious right now oh i
[1:09:45] love jesus he loaded the camels
[1:09:48] full of good gifts to give the bride and
[1:09:50] he never told her that they were for
[1:09:52] another generation
[1:09:53] or for another day but they were for the
[1:09:56] bride
[1:09:58] hallelujah and every true servant of god
[1:10:01] that sent out

[1:10:09] be floods in front of you
[1:10:11] there might be obstacles in front of you
[1:10:14] but there's still a book here full of
[1:10:15] promises

[1:10:56] of god can
[1:10:57] put trust in that he won't try to hide
[1:11:00] it from her
[1:11:01] because she know he knows she is the
[1:11:04] oncoming queen
[1:11:07] no good thing from there will be

[1:12:05] moving very strongly almost couldn't
[1:12:07] even hold myself together
[1:12:11] he came to the well in the evening time
[1:12:13] notice the time
[1:12:14] evening time it came a time that when
[1:12:17] eliezer had to make another decision
[1:12:19] whether he would trust his own opinion
[1:12:22] or would trust god's opinion
[1:12:25] he said that's how true servants get so
[1:12:27] mixed up they'll look around
[1:12:29] some fine painted jezebel and say oh
[1:12:31] there's the lord you're calling me
[1:12:33] he said but that's just intellectual
[1:12:34] speaking to you he said let god speak
