[47:21] amen
[47:22] amen
[47:25] amen as I said last night I want to say
[47:29] thank you for coming for being a
[47:32] part we heard a wonderful message last
[47:35] night and we were so blessed by Brother
[47:38] Tom Ray and thank you brother Tom and we
[47:42] so appreciate that it was such a
[47:44] blessing to us and it just you know
[47:48] strengthens our heart and our resolve
[47:50] when we hear the word
[47:52] priest and brother brother brandham said
[47:56] this he said I believe the church is
[47:58] beginning to hear the message beginning
[48:01] to understand it but friend listen we
[48:04] got to lay in the presence of the sun we
[48:07] got to be ripened our faith isn't right
[48:10] intellectually we're hearing the message
[48:12] that God has give us and seeing the
[48:15] signs that he has shown us and proving
[48:18] it by the Bible is there but all how the
[48:21] church needs to lay in his presence till
[48:24] it tenders up you know and gets sweet in
[48:26] the spirit so he can bathe down then he
[48:30] went on to say and let me just
[48:32] paraphrase this part he says you know as
[48:35] we near that great
[48:38] time he spoke of the atmosphere of when
[48:41] he went beyond the curtain of
[48:44] time which is the atmosphere of the Holy
[48:47] Ghost he said must be the same here as
[48:50] it was there you see that's what we want
[48:54] in this building here tonight we want
[48:57] the same atmosphere of the Holy Ghost
[49:00] that is in heaven to be right here that
[49:03] causes us then to be in Heavenly
[49:05] places amen where Heaven comes down and
[49:09] Angels move Among Us and the spirit of
[49:12] God
[49:13] moves because when it moves demons has
[49:16] to flee sickness has to go death has to
[49:20] give way to the name of Jesus Christ I
[49:24] want you to believe with all your heart
[49:26] and let's do it more than just
[49:29] intellectually but let's enter into the
[49:31] spirit you pray tonight God let me
[49:34] receive this more than just hearing you
[49:38] know a nice sermon and it just occupying
[49:41] a moment or two of my life but Lord may
[49:45] make it real to me as brother Brandon
[49:48] said in why Christ speak he said I think
[49:51] any man woman boy or girl I think in an
[49:54] intellectual conception of what they
[49:55] think the word is is and so forth can
[49:58] never have a full Foundation until they
[50:01] have met that light that brings the word
[50:03] to reality I think no church in this
[50:07] practice no matter how intellectual or
[50:09] fundamental it might be that church
[50:11] cannot Thrive until the Supernatural is
[50:15] made known among the people and they see
[50:17] it's something they can talk to that
[50:20] will talk back to them that vindicates
[50:23] this written word I'll tell you tonight
[50:26] we've must be a people who knows who we
[50:29] are as we heard last night who speaks
[50:32] Heaven's language and understands
[50:35] Heaven's language and let the Holy
[50:38] Spirit move in your life tonight I want
[50:40] you to tune in with everything that you
[50:42] have now put everything else aside and
[50:46] say Lord as you're passing
[50:48] by I'm going to reach out and touch
[50:51] you I'm not going to miss my
[50:54] opportunity this is an opport Unity
[50:57] tonight we have our brother Michael Ray
[51:00] who's going to be ministering the word
[51:02] brother
[51:04] Michael has been a blessing many many
[51:08] places already used around the world and
[51:13] you know as I think about young men that
[51:16] are stepping up into the the realm of
[51:20] the Gospel you know I remember myself
[51:24] back years ago now preaching in my in my
[51:27] 30s I as I turned 30 years old began to
[51:31] preach conv conventions all over the
[51:34] United States and around and through you
[51:36] know through and and
[51:38] continue and I thought when I heard
[51:41] brother brandham say you know I believe
[51:44] there'll be young men that will rise up
[51:45] to take this message and sweep it to the
[51:48] coming of the Lord I thought I was that
[51:51] young man I was one of them young men
[51:55] but now
[51:57] there are other young men that are
[52:00] stepping forward and moving on the
[52:04] gospel is moving on let's move with it
[52:08] let him speak to you tonight let the
[52:11] supernatural be made known among us to
[52:14] you personally the Holy Ghost made real
[52:17] to your life where he speaks to you and
[52:20] you speak back to him come into the
[52:23] presence of that light as brother
[52:25] Michael comes tonight let's enter in
[52:28] with all our hearts Reach

[53:48] [Music]
[53:50] reach as
[53:52] he go
[53:57] amen did you come intended to do that
[54:00] amen my I just been enjoying the worship
[54:02] there in the back study and had to come
[54:04] out a little early cuz I Haden been part
[54:05] of it for a little while it's just a
[54:07] sweet presence here tonight we're just
[54:10] so privileged to be here I I'll leave
[54:13] you standing for just a moment because
[54:15] then it we'll go to scripture but uh you
[54:17] know I was here seven years ago when the
[54:19] building was dedicated the sanctuary and
[54:21] the church here was dedicated and that
[54:23] was the year that I first uh well the
[54:26] Lord
[54:26] changed my direction just a few months
[54:29] prior that so I'm kind of Linked In Time
[54:31] with your dedication is kind of equal to
[54:33] my time preaching but I remember I was
[54:35] in a photograph at a ban at a dinner or
[54:38] lunch we had and and somebody was a
[54:40] Minister's dinner and I was there I'm
[54:42] like I I'm I'm fresh I'm not even a
[54:44] minister yet I don't think I'd even
[54:45] preached actually and I just remember
[54:47] being really really uncomfortable in a
[54:49] big picture and I remember I was by
[54:50] brother Donnie Reagan said what am I
[54:52] doing
[54:54] here my I kind of have them same
[54:56] thoughts right now what am I doing
[54:59] here but it's just uh just an incredible
[55:02] privilege and and honor I know to be
[55:05] honest I'm a little bit feared of
[55:07] preaching here not out of fear but just
[55:09] a deep deep respect that I have for
[55:12] brother Tim am man your ministry brother
[55:14] Tim brother Timothy he's not here but
[55:16] mine he meant so much to us the
[55:18] congregation here has been a lighthouse
[55:20] that's what you're called but you have
[55:23] been that Ministry has gone around the
[55:25] world it's been such a lighthouse to us
[55:27] and my family personally even and so I
[55:29] really just deem it such an honor to
[55:31] stand before you I don't have anything
[55:33] to say I just pray he says something
[55:36] that's really all I care and desire
[55:38] tonight and so you know you might hear a
[55:42] few things you heard last night I was
[55:44] cringing in my
[55:45] seat I was loving it and I was
[55:49] struggling there a little bit I said Dad
[55:53] Mercy you know it's one thing to have a
[55:55] Runway it's another thing to have him
[55:56] take a plane right off me like well you
[55:58] just took the whole thought from
[55:59] me but it was a wonderful word wasn't it
[56:02] amen because it's true and so maybe
[56:05] tonight the Lord is uh maybe Desiring
[56:08] you know to sit down you know and maybe
[56:10] sometimes he just wants to repeat
[56:12] something as even butter Tom said last
[56:14] night you sometimes our our fathers you
[56:16] know would sit us down and they're going
[56:18] to say something to us and they repeat
[56:19] it it's not because they're losing their
[56:21] memory because they sit down there and
[56:23] they say I want you to hear this again
[56:24] and listen really close and so you like
[56:27] okay the first time I maybe caught half
[56:28] of it but the next time I'm going to
[56:30] catch it all maybe that's just what the
[56:31] Lord's Desiring tonight in a in a little
[56:33] bit of a way and so we come to hear from
[56:36] him and we're just going to just give
[56:38] him the rest of the night all right amen
[56:40] so why don't we turn to the scripture
[56:42] we're going to turn to
[56:47] Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes ver chapter 8
[56:50] as want to thank the hospitality here is
[56:52] just incredible I I just can't thank you
[56:55] enough butter Timothy Tim sister Ruth
[56:57] and just all the and even a little bag
[57:00] in my on the bed when I got to the room
[57:02] and you know inside there was worther
[57:03] caramels I was like man they got me
[57:06] pegged they know all the
[57:09] details you would amen and so we're just
[57:12] so grateful to be part of this this is
[57:14] special where we have never really been
[57:15] here we have some very very dear friends
[57:17] here oh everybody here's a dear friend
[57:19] how do you differentiate but you know
[57:21] we've never had the opportunity to be
[57:23] here with the Spencers and the puits and
[57:24] like this is is just real special and uh
[57:27] so I deem it such an honor Ecclesiastes
[57:34] 8 I canel Thee to keep the king's
[57:37] commandment verse two and that in regard
[57:40] of the oath of God be not Hasty to go
[57:42] out of his sight and stand not in an
[57:44] evil thing for he doeth whatsoever
[57:46] pleaseth him where the word of a king is
[57:50] there's
[57:52] power I love that scripture amen where
[57:55] the word of a king is there is power and
[57:57] who may say unto him what doest thou all
[58:01] right let's just extrapolate that in our
[58:03] minds where we're going amen we can even
[58:05] you know we can turn maybe to Amos 3
[58:08] another maybe scripture we would know
[58:10] quite well Amos 3 turn to verse
[58:24] S all right Amos 3 and 7 we know surely
[58:28] the Lord God will do nothing but reveal
[58:31] us his Secrets unto his servants the
[58:32] prophets and verse 8 says the lion hath
[58:35] roared who will not fear the lord God
[58:39] hath spoken who can but
[58:42] prophesy amen why don't we just have a
[58:44] word of
[58:46] prayer Heavenly Father tonight we're so
[58:49] desirous Lord that you're you draw near
[58:52] to us Lord so near as we sang the song
[58:55] that we could read Reach Out And Touch
[58:57] You Lord as that little lady reached out
[58:59] and took a hold of your garment cuz she
[59:01] had such a need she did whatever it took
[59:04] to get to that position that you were in
[59:06] such proximity that all she needed to do
[59:10] was reach for your garment Lord if that
[59:12] could be the case for each and every
[59:14] soul tonight that Lord you could draw so
[59:17] close and Lord each heart would be so
[59:19] desires to reach out and touch you Lord
[59:22] that you could meet individual needs and
[59:24] desires deep areas and burdens of the
[59:26] soul and the heart that Lord you alone
[59:28] know for you know our secrets Lord you
[59:31] you know our deep areas Lord even those
[59:33] areas where when we pray it's it's but a
[59:35] groaning that Lord we can't even express
[59:37] it but you know that place so Lord I
[59:40] pray tonight you can just touch us you
[59:42] can move in our midst and you would
[59:44] speak to our heart in Jesus Christ's
[59:46] name amen amen you may have your seats
[59:52] tonight I mean I want to take a little
[59:54] thought tonight I have I could go two
[59:56] titles my original title was when the
[59:58] king speaks and uh you can maybe see why
[1:00:01] I was having some weary uh thoughts
[1:00:03] there yesterday cuz butter Tom was
[1:00:05] nailing that but I was said I almost
[1:00:07] brought a second set of notes but the
[1:00:09] Lord made me forget so I didn't so
[1:00:10] therefore this is what I
[1:00:12] got just in case but I'm going to speak
[1:00:15] on a little subject You Pull and I'll
[1:00:17] try and and just let the Lord have his
[1:00:19] way amen we'll just relax that's what
[1:00:21] we're here for it's Friday night so
[1:00:22] nobody's going to work I bet tomorrow
[1:00:24] morning maybe those that have weird
[1:00:25] shifts but for the rest of us we're here
[1:00:27] for a good time amen so we're going to
[1:00:29] and then if I took a little bit of a
[1:00:31] secondary title if I wanted to I'm going
[1:00:32] to call it that's what they say okay
[1:00:35] that's what they say you know everyone
[1:00:37] in this world feels like they have a say
[1:00:38] on something especially in these days
[1:00:40] with social media everybody's got 18
[1:00:42] platforms that they're going to say the
[1:00:43] same thing 18 different times because
[1:00:45] they need to make sure that everybody
[1:00:46] hears their say on the matter but you
[1:00:49] know when someone important or someone
[1:00:51] of of a certain level has something to
[1:00:53] say suddenly that statement because of
[1:00:55] their rank or their position it becomes
[1:00:57] profound you know it means something
[1:00:59] even more because there's some celebrity
[1:01:01] or something like that even some famous
[1:01:03] orchar we know over time you could just
[1:01:05] say A you could say a line you could say
[1:01:07] I have a dream and you know exactly or
[1:01:09] most people should know exactly who that
[1:01:10] came from other people would say well if
[1:01:12] I said Give me liberty or give me death
[1:01:14] I'm certain the Virginians and those on
[1:01:16] the you know around here should know
[1:01:18] what that means too right I know there's
[1:01:20] some Virginians here did I hear an amen
[1:01:21] from
[1:01:22] that that's right because they they're
[1:01:25] of some position position some stature
[1:01:26] and so you know when they said something
[1:01:28] it meant something it really had
[1:01:30] something to say or or certain
[1:01:31] quotations you know ask not what your
[1:01:33] country can do for you and you can
[1:01:34] finish the rest of it because that was
[1:01:36] done by a president here or we do we go
[1:01:38] to history class still okay well that
[1:01:40] was John Kennedy for you all right
[1:01:42] genius is 1% inspiration 99%
[1:01:44] persperation Thomas Edison famous things
[1:01:47] famous things because of of who they are
[1:01:49] right men are women today if they spoke
[1:01:51] something it's heated and people follow
[1:01:53] you know I bet you I bet you you know
[1:01:55] there's a lot of people they don't
[1:01:56] really care what your current
[1:01:58] presidential candidates are saying but
[1:01:59] if they say it they're going to follow
[1:02:01] it just because right it just just where
[1:02:03] humanity is gone right now but you know
[1:02:05] there's a much famous
[1:02:08] quoter in all of these
[1:02:11] people it's
[1:02:15] they you know so often life are placed
[1:02:18] up against what they
[1:02:19] say you know someone uses well they say
[1:02:23] you know it's it's some way to hide
[1:02:25] behind you know their own thoughts are
[1:02:27] hidden in some ambiguous group of people
[1:02:29] that kind of believe something but you
[1:02:31] know they don't really so what they say
[1:02:33] such and such or they say this is how
[1:02:35] it's supposed to be and so it's this
[1:02:37] strong illusion that someone of
[1:02:39] authority is a source all right it it's
[1:02:42] eludes that there's a many you know a
[1:02:44] large group of people that believe this
[1:02:47] way so so yet but if they're queried
[1:02:49] about who it is as well it's just they
[1:02:51] that's what they say about it well who
[1:02:52] exactly is that I don't know but they
[1:02:54] say it so it must be it right it must be
[1:02:57] gospel you know if you drink tea with
[1:02:59] lemon it'll protect you from catching a
[1:03:00] cold who said that I don't know they
[1:03:02] said it it must be gospel right eight
[1:03:06] cup hey a lot of little a lot of sisters
[1:03:08] here drink eight cups or more of water a
[1:03:10] day because it's it's healthy for you
[1:03:13] who said that I don't know they
[1:03:15] did so it counts that's
[1:03:20] right yeah how many things that they say
[1:03:22] that you believe you're like well I
[1:03:23] don't know Google it who's Google it's
[1:03:26] I'll tell you that right now it's
[1:03:27] exactly who it is it's it's an algorithm
[1:03:30] yeah so when you go to Google and switch
[1:03:31] to Bing or whatever it's just they
[1:03:33] that's who you're believing they said it
[1:03:35] you believe it yeah well you know you
[1:03:37] swallow five spiders in a lifetime they
[1:03:39] say right
[1:03:41] right is who has anybody here swallowed
[1:03:44] a spider in the middle of the night and
[1:03:46] you're
[1:03:48] like no probably not but they say you do
[1:03:50] at least five so they are the most
[1:03:53] famous I would say more famous quoter
[1:03:56] than any of the prior ones and any any
[1:03:58] other ones you know I know my daddy he
[1:03:59] was told you know you can't after eating
[1:04:01] you can't go swimming for like 30 to 60
[1:04:03] minutes cuz you get sick who said it
[1:04:06] they
[1:04:08] did and after time they're like you know
[1:04:10] what it's
[1:04:11] wrong who said that they did you get my
[1:04:16] point and I'm just overwhelmed actually
[1:04:18] how many people will actually take an
[1:04:21] opinion because somebody with some two-
[1:04:23] bit knowledge has really come up and
[1:04:25] they have zero Vindication on anything
[1:04:27] but they said it so it must be true I'm
[1:04:30] sorry this just not the case who's your
[1:04:33] Source they's my source you know my
[1:04:36] goodness we had a climate activist named
[1:04:37] thunberg who was like 15 and because she
[1:04:39] sailed across the ocean she became the
[1:04:40] authority on climate change why and and
[1:04:44] it all trickles down suddenly and we
[1:04:46] can't have plastic straws in Canada
[1:04:47] because they killed the turtles why
[1:04:49] because they said
[1:04:50] it it's like dear
[1:04:53] goodness it's true
[1:04:56] I come down the states to have a plastic
[1:04:58] straw I'm so
[1:05:00] happy
[1:05:02] yeah thank you it's a simple things in
[1:05:05] life oh my but you know that's the
[1:05:08] natural just to set a little bit of
[1:05:10] foundation that's the natural realm they
[1:05:12] say a lot of things you know but you
[1:05:14] know you can get into the into the
[1:05:16] spiritual I should say even the the
[1:05:18] Realms of of where we believe and I even
[1:05:20] heard I heard a statement just in the
[1:05:22] last few days or last week and and
[1:05:24] someone said you know now the going
[1:05:26] thing is you know can flirt and then
[1:05:27] convert you know we can just go out
[1:05:29] there and flirt with the world and then
[1:05:30] maybe we'll convert them and then we'll
[1:05:32] you know marry them who said that they
[1:05:35] did that's your Source I can tell you
[1:05:38] this
[1:05:39] didn't this don't say
[1:05:42] that you know we can get buy with an
[1:05:44] emotional experience oh it's okay to
[1:05:47] trim my hair it's okay to dabble in
[1:05:48] music it's okay to do this it's okay to
[1:05:50] do that and really at the end of the day
[1:05:51] who says that who really said that
[1:05:54] someone's trickling down and you want to
[1:05:55] get get back to it it's it's they that
[1:05:56] said it and Satan loves that broad just
[1:05:59] that broad statement you know painted
[1:06:00] with a big brush it denotes the crowd so
[1:06:02] we're
[1:06:03] okay I really don't care about the crowd
[1:06:07] I don't care the majority amen God if
[1:06:09] you look into your scripture majority
[1:06:11] didn't matter if you following majority
[1:06:12] you actually were on the wrong side of
[1:06:14] the table you really wanted to find
[1:06:16] yourself on the minority side I wanted
[1:06:18] to be with Elijah all alone on Mount
[1:06:19] Carmel I want to be with Mya there when
[1:06:22] in Jehosaphat I want to be all alone
[1:06:23] with them that's who I want to be
[1:06:24] identified with not the majority I can
[1:06:27] tell you not with the they oh
[1:06:31] sir so there's two
[1:06:33] sides there's what they say and there's
[1:06:36] What God Says amen Jesus said now
[1:06:39] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:06:41] word shall never pass away so Joshua
[1:06:43] knowing that his word must rest upon
[1:06:45] God's word he put God's word first wish
[1:06:47] you wish you sick people here tonight
[1:06:49] would do that because now there's what
[1:06:52] God says there's what they say and then
[1:06:54] there's what you say okay and you get a
[1:06:57] choice of where to go along that line
[1:06:59] and brother Bram said put God's word
[1:07:01] with your confession put your confession
[1:07:04] you believe it set it out there and call
[1:07:06] those things which are not as though
[1:07:09] they were amen so you're going to choose
[1:07:11] tonight where are you going to put your
[1:07:12] confession or your words are you going
[1:07:14] to go with they and what they say or you
[1:07:16] going to go with what God's word said no
[1:07:18] matter the
[1:07:19] cost
[1:07:23] amen you know I wonder what Noah would
[1:07:25] say if we were standing with Noah and we
[1:07:26] said you know Noah how did it go with
[1:07:28] you back when you were were starting the
[1:07:30] days when God spoke to you I could
[1:07:32] imagine if if we if we had an interview
[1:07:34] with Noah we went up there even had a
[1:07:35] microphone and said you know what what
[1:07:37] what what did they say you know well I
[1:07:40] Noah what do you say about the matter
[1:07:41] we're going to interview Noah a little
[1:07:42] bit and say Noah what exactly was was
[1:07:44] well they told me that there was they
[1:07:46] don't even know what rain meant you know
[1:07:47] they said there was not even any
[1:07:48] moisture in the sky in fact they said I
[1:07:51] was I was completely delusional as I was
[1:07:53] trying to tell them that God spoke to me
[1:07:55] and then that doubter said what really
[1:07:57] they said a flood what even is is that
[1:07:59] where's all the the water going to come
[1:08:00] from and so I had the I even preached I
[1:08:03] preached for 10 years and 20 years and
[1:08:05] to 30 years and they said Noah when are
[1:08:08] you going to be done I I really can't
[1:08:09] stay here any longer you're preaching
[1:08:12] the same gospel all these years in fact
[1:08:13] our message hasn't changed you haven't
[1:08:16] changed with the times Noah they said
[1:08:17] You Know This is oldfashioned Gospel I
[1:08:19] gotta
[1:08:22] go they said you're losing it Noah they
[1:08:25] did he said I was really losing my touch
[1:08:27] after 100 years preaching the same thing
[1:08:29] he said really we're out can't hear you
[1:08:32] can't stay here any
[1:08:35] longer what else did they say no well
[1:08:38] they put Rockets up into the air they
[1:08:39] told me there was no moisture they told
[1:08:40] me I was crazy they said my message was
[1:08:43] too tough they said that they told me
[1:08:45] that you know it so restrictive that all
[1:08:48] I had to do is was I had to go in the
[1:08:49] ark I had to I had to go in a place of
[1:08:51] safety but really I could I had my own
[1:08:53] ideas or I wanted to weigh a little bit
[1:08:54] and and they and so they they kept
[1:08:56] telling me it's it's too strict a gospel
[1:08:58] no it's it's too oldfashioned you know
[1:09:00] that I got to wear my my dresses and and
[1:09:02] conduct myself this way and and act a
[1:09:04] certain way I couldn't really follow
[1:09:05] certain certain music Trends and
[1:09:07] entertainment Trends I just didn't like
[1:09:08] it so they they they said they're out
[1:09:11] wow Noah you dealt with the naysayers
[1:09:13] huh I sure did but Noah what did God
[1:09:17] say well he told me that there was going
[1:09:20] to be a flood and I needed to build an
[1:09:23] ark okay any more details well he gave
[1:09:27] me a little bit of details on how to
[1:09:29] build it but that's about it you said
[1:09:30] there's going to be a flood and I need
[1:09:31] to be in the ark seriously no is there
[1:09:35] any more can you expand on what God Said
[1:09:37] there no that's all I got amen you mean
[1:09:39] you just got a few little lines from God
[1:09:41] and then you just followed in it I did
[1:09:43] because he said it therefore I believed
[1:09:45] it Noah come on expand the word for me a
[1:09:48] little bit more give me a little bit
[1:09:49] more what God Said all he said was
[1:09:51] there's going to be an ark and I had to
[1:09:52] be it or a flood and I got to be in the
[1:09:54] ark so what did you do Noah I believed
[1:09:57] it contrary to what all they said yes
[1:10:00] because he said it therefore I believe
[1:10:02] [Applause]
[1:10:06] it it's where you got to be can you
[1:10:09] imagine preaching for 120 years can you
[1:10:12] imagine that brother Tim stood at this
[1:10:14] Pulpit for 120 years and preached the
[1:10:16] same thing get in the ark oh man how
[1:10:20] many would be here 120 years from
[1:10:23] now every single single one of
[1:10:26] you because the seed inside of you will
[1:10:29] anchor you to that Pew and say Yes
[1:10:31] better Tim I believe it I'm get it in
[1:10:33] the ark because that's what my soul's
[1:10:35] crying for amen hey you got to put
[1:10:39] yourself there don't be like well I
[1:10:40] don't know after 120 years you would
[1:10:42] still be here because you're already
[1:10:44] here Amen brother said what you are
[1:10:47] today you would have been that day so if
[1:10:49] you're still here today after pressure
[1:10:51] after this after that after what they
[1:10:53] say you're still here you'd be there too
[1:10:58] amen
[1:11:00] hallelujah I don't care what they
[1:11:02] [Applause]
[1:11:05] say well Joshua Caleb can I give you can
[1:11:09] I interview a little bit tonight sure
[1:11:11] what would you like to what would you
[1:11:12] like to ask me well I'm really
[1:11:13] interested in the time when you went to
[1:11:15] when you went and spied the land and you
[1:11:17] went across into the promised land and
[1:11:19] Moses sent you across to have you come
[1:11:21] back and bring us back some evidence
[1:11:23] yeah yeah that was a wonderful time
[1:11:25] man me and Joshua were just so on fire
[1:11:28] as we came across we are carrying the
[1:11:29] grapes my goodness them things were like
[1:11:31] graef fruits and we couldn't get way to
[1:11:33] get back and say get a taste of this Amy
[1:11:36] man you got to dig into this word you
[1:11:39] got to get in this message look what's
[1:11:41] coming our day a gospel message to take
[1:11:43] us out of here wow what happened Caleb
[1:11:47] well we got back we started to tell
[1:11:50] everybody how amazing it was what did
[1:11:54] they say
[1:11:56] well you would have thought they got on
[1:11:58] board but they said the cities are too
[1:12:00] big they said there was Giants in the
[1:12:03] land that were too tall too Valiant too
[1:12:06] Mighty they said we're too we're small
[1:12:08] like little grasshoppers they said we
[1:12:10] can't do it seriously yeah of all the
[1:12:16] nerve in
[1:12:20] fact they even agreed that the land was
[1:12:24] beautiful they actually even said it was
[1:12:26] nice they they agreed that there was
[1:12:28] such lovely things milk and honey but
[1:12:30] you know what they said they threw it
[1:12:32] back in God's face and said we can't do
[1:12:35] it can you imagine God had promised them
[1:12:38] to land he said I'll take you there he'
[1:12:41] already brought them out of Egypt
[1:12:42] through the Red Sea plague upon plague
[1:12:44] he'd been already providing away and
[1:12:46] then they went over they get some
[1:12:48] evidence say sorry our God's not great
[1:12:50] enough
[1:12:57] he's not able they said our God is
[1:13:00] essentially
[1:13:01] weaker right he's lesser than the men of
[1:13:06] earth that's what they essentially said
[1:13:10] when they said we are not
[1:13:12] able and when we put doubt on God's
[1:13:17] word our
[1:13:20] land and say well I'm just struggling
[1:13:24] doubting there no no no no no no no
[1:13:25] don't do that because you're throwing
[1:13:27] God's word back in his face saying he's
[1:13:30] not able you're telling me that the king
[1:13:33] of glory is not able to take you into
[1:13:36] the promised land after he already
[1:13:38] brought you out of Egypt that's what
[1:13:40] they said how wow Caleb I
[1:13:43] mean you know what had even happened I
[1:13:45] I'll just tell you this a little bit but
[1:13:46] we went even down we were trying to
[1:13:48] trying to tell them you know and they
[1:13:49] even wanted to Stone
[1:13:52] me they turned against word of the
[1:13:55] prophet and then tried to kill me oh
[1:14:00] really you mean they turned against the
[1:14:01] message of the hour you mean they they
[1:14:04] went right against what Moses had been
[1:14:05] preaching the word of that day and they
[1:14:07] wanted to Stone it and kill it and and
[1:14:09] kill the life that you had that's
[1:14:11] exactly right weren't you one of them
[1:14:12] well looks like there was a dividing
[1:14:15] line looks like there's a dividing line
[1:14:18] oh yeah that's right well Caleb what did
[1:14:21] God
[1:14:23] say he said go and possess
[1:14:27] it he's said I can hear Moses even now
[1:14:30] telling us about the land filled with
[1:14:32] milk and honey and I can tell you the
[1:14:34] first time that I heard the message I
[1:14:35] mean the first time that I heard Moses
[1:14:37] speak about what was in that land well
[1:14:39] the first time I dug into the message
[1:14:41] the first time I saw serpent seed the
[1:14:43] first time I saw the opening of the word
[1:14:45] I tell you I couldn't wait to get there
[1:14:48] oh my heart was Surge I was putting my
[1:14:50] sword in my Bel already my shield was on
[1:14:52] my arm saying when Moses when can I get
[1:14:56] there because my God said and I believed
[1:15:01] it amen and we believe
[1:15:04] [Applause]
[1:15:09] it what what exactly did you say Caleb I
[1:15:12] believed it and I still believe
[1:15:16] it can we skip up a little bit let's
[1:15:19] just come back to Caleb a little while
[1:15:20] later cuz Caleb had to walk his way
[1:15:22] around the Wilderness for a little bit
[1:15:24] of time he had 40 Years of wandering in
[1:15:25] the wilderness can you imagine with
[1:15:27] people that had murmured the whole time
[1:15:30] and he's waiting this whole time I can't
[1:15:32] get across because they doubted you know
[1:15:35] what no he didn't get all mad and Dy and
[1:15:37] and upset and then cranky and all that
[1:15:38] but he just kept going I can I will I do
[1:15:42] believe I can I will I do believe Moses
[1:15:46] this and Moses that this and that I can
[1:15:49] I will I do believe I believe this time
[1:15:51] believe I don't know but this right this
[1:15:53] this I can't I will I do believe I don't
[1:15:56] care what they say whatever they say I
[1:15:59] believe it amen that's the people we are
[1:16:03] when he spoke it we believe it
[1:16:07] Hallelujah my Caleb I'm enjoying this
[1:16:09] interview with you a little bit can you
[1:16:11] talk to me a little bit more I sure can

[1:16:26] he could he'd be saying I can I will I
[1:16:29] do believe and I'm stronger in my faith
[1:16:31] now than it was when I
[1:16:35] began and Caleb said now behold the Lord
[1:16:38] hath kept me alive as he said these 40
[1:16:40] and five years since the Lord spake and
[1:16:42] he said and yet I'm as strong this day
[1:16:45] as I was in the day that Moses sent me
[1:16:47] as my strength was then even so is my
[1:16:49] strength now for war both to go out and
[1:16:52] to come back in man this was a
[1:16:59] warrior now what else do you say Caleb

[1:26:11] said you're here it again in thy
[1:26:15] [Applause]
[1:26:18] mouth
[1:26:20] okay I'm just going to give it an
[1:26:22] example or two
[1:26:26] on what happens when the king himself
[1:26:32] speaks there was a moment in
[1:26:37] scripture when the king walking in flesh
[1:26:41] came into a
[1:26:42] household that had a very sick man or I
[1:26:46] should say he got word of a very sick
[1:26:50] man Pastor your friend
[1:26:53] Lazarus
[1:26:55] sick all
[1:26:58] right what did he do he kept
[1:27:02] going he ignored him you would say
[1:27:05] that's right you would
[1:27:08] say and he didn't come in fact Jesus
[1:27:10] turned his back and didn't even come
[1:27:13] someone say well you you you walk this
[1:27:17] Faith how long have you been in this
[1:27:19] gospel you mean you believe this message
[1:27:20] for how many years God hasn't met your
[1:27:22] need what kind of God is that I mean
[1:27:24] really come on Lazarus was a close
[1:27:25] friend I mean wouldn't he call come on
[1:27:27] Master come come he he's he's
[1:27:30] dying did he did he acknowledge that he
[1:27:32] was coming no no he actually just turned
[1:27:34] and they kept going you mean he didn't
[1:27:36] even turn
[1:27:38] around you mean you've 20 years you've
[1:27:40] been in this message you've had a
[1:27:42] situation and God hasn't answered your
[1:27:43] prayer what kind of God is
[1:27:46] that let back up forget this I've been
[1:27:49] in this message so long God has even
[1:27:50] heard my heard my prayer no that's not
[1:27:53] what they did all
[1:27:56] right in fact he went many day few days
[1:28:01] went by Lazarus passes away and now he's
[1:28:04] been even four days and
[1:28:06] finally Jesus says we need to go back he
[1:28:09] speaks to his disciples we know the
[1:28:10] story for sake of time we're not going
[1:28:11] to go into it but now the king himself
[1:28:13] has turned around because the appointed
[1:28:15] time that he knew was on the scene amen
[1:28:18] you don't know the appointed time but he
[1:28:21] does and I know you know the song when
[1:28:22] he's 4 days late he's still on time and
[1:28:25] you need to pocket that in your heart
[1:28:26] and say Lord I don't know but I've been
[1:28:28] holding on to your word for a long time
[1:28:30] and I'm just waiting for the moment when
[1:28:31] my king steps on the scene maybe it's
[1:28:34] tonight when he said it's all good you
[1:28:36] waited long enough but tonight I'm
[1:28:39] here he walks into the midst of Mary and
[1:28:43] Martha and now he starts to take control
[1:28:46] of the scene and the word steps now into
[1:28:48] the room or into the moment now and oh
[1:28:51] my goodness I can imagine all the
[1:28:52] different things that they said to Mary
[1:28:54] and Martha many many things that they
[1:28:57] said but that wasn't the concern Mary
[1:29:00] and Martha found themselves at the feet
[1:29:01] of Jesus and said even
[1:29:04] now even now you can take control of the
[1:29:07] situation even at this moment tonight in
[1:29:10] this service Lord I don't know what's
[1:29:12] going on before and all the past time
[1:29:14] but even
[1:29:16] now that's the heart of a Believer say
[1:29:18] Lord even in this moment you can raise
[1:29:21] up my son you can raise up my daughter
[1:29:23] you can catch a hold of my son that's
[1:29:25] gone L even
[1:29:27] [Applause]
[1:29:34] now why because the king had just
[1:29:38] stepped into the
[1:29:40] midst they just saw a lowely man of
[1:29:43] Galilee but it really was the King of
[1:29:46] Kings if the world could just have
[1:29:48] caught that if the world could just
[1:29:50] catch it
[1:29:57] you
[1:29:58] know those events now started to
[1:30:01] transpire and there was nothing any
[1:30:05] devil could do to stop
[1:30:08] it there was no Force when he said roll
[1:30:12] back the stone and every Demon's like
[1:30:14] what's going on something's happening
[1:30:17] down in the Tomb of Lazarus I don't
[1:30:19] really quite understand it because I
[1:30:20] don't know if they're all really
[1:30:21] figuring out who is actually there
[1:30:22] themselves because if th be the son if
[1:30:24] thou be if thou be he was wondering
[1:30:26] devil was wondering and like what's this
[1:30:28] going on he just rolled back a stone on
[1:30:30] a dead man yeah something's out of place
[1:30:34] push the stone back boys I'm sorry but
[1:30:36] if every demon in Hell had tried to get
[1:30:39] that stone back into place nothing could
[1:30:42] hold that stone nothing would shut the
[1:30:44] door because the king had said roll back
[1:30:47] the
[1:30:49] stone I'm telling you tonight the king
[1:30:51] is in the midst and he's saying roll
[1:30:53] back the stone yes sir somebody that's
[1:30:56] dead is about to come alive throw back
[1:30:58] the stone I've stepped on the scene
[1:31:01] tonight in Louisiana and I'm saying roll
[1:31:03] back to Stone because I'm here I'm here
[1:31:05] to speak and when I
[1:31:08] [Applause]
[1:31:11] speak brother Brown says in other words
[1:31:14] it must be fulfilled at the word of that
[1:31:16] God has spoken must be fulfilled God
[1:31:19] cannot say anything without having it
[1:31:21] fulfilled when he has spoken it it's a
[1:31:23] finished work work it's already finished
[1:31:25] when God speaks
[1:31:26] it God never speaks until he's ready to
[1:31:29] for it to be and when he speaks it's
[1:31:31] just as well already
[1:31:33] happened now if that wouldn't give us a
[1:31:36] basis to put our faith on this morning
[1:31:38] when God speaks our word it's already
[1:31:40] finished and what about his promises
[1:31:42] that he has given to us come on he said
[1:31:46] so therefore when we receive the word
[1:31:48] into our heart it's already done
[1:31:55] what a
[1:31:56] moment when the king then said
[1:32:01] Lazarus come
[1:32:03] forth you know everything was dead still
[1:32:07] for a few seconds oh
[1:32:10] yeah as all creation went in
[1:32:13] harsh who just
[1:32:16] spoke I tell you that rippled through
[1:32:18] every Dimension the shock waves of that
[1:32:21] word that's right
[1:32:25] hold
[1:32:27] it and then out comes this clothed WRA
[1:32:31] white grave clothed human being hey I'm
[1:32:35] sorry but it was quiet no longer that's
[1:32:39] right for a few moments as it was a hush
[1:32:42] who just spoke then they figured out
[1:32:44] pretty quickly the king just spoke
[1:32:48] because no one else can speak and allow
[1:32:50] those words to cross over into another
[1:32:53] dimension mention and drag his Spirit
[1:32:56] back into a body raise him off the stone
[1:32:59] table and bring him out I can tell you
[1:33:01] he wasn't walking like this some
[1:33:03] Supernatural Force started to move him
[1:33:06] out the door then he said loose him and
[1:33:08] let him go so that Reet could get
[1:33:10] praising and walk in and say guess what
[1:33:13] my king
[1:33:17] spoke
[1:33:21] amen hallelujah
[1:33:24] that's our God whose word word can cross
[1:33:28] into other dimensions and penetrate into
[1:33:31] your realm and complete the
[1:33:34] [Applause]
[1:33:40] promise
[1:33:42] don't belittle the power of the
[1:33:49] word
[1:33:50] Abraham by speaking the word
[1:33:54] and staggering not at the promise I
[1:33:58] imagine as he was pondering as we talked
[1:34:01] about and he would Ponder the words that
[1:34:03] God had told him he would be speaking
[1:34:06] the word and I can imagine as he would
[1:34:09] Ponder he'd be speaking it and telling
[1:34:11] Sarah Sarah this is what God told me
[1:34:14] Sarah this is what God said he said
[1:34:16] you're having a baby he said it's going
[1:34:18] to happen and Sarah was just receiving
[1:34:20] that she was hearing it Faith cometh by
[1:34:24] hearing the word of God like I said
[1:34:26] Abraham didn't have
[1:34:27] this but he had to speak and he pondered
[1:34:32] and he let that word mold and he'd speak
[1:34:34] it and Sarah would hear it and she also
[1:34:37] would start to ponder the word you know
[1:34:41] what it started to
[1:34:43] do you know when the word leaves your
[1:34:46] lips it's disturbs the air and it
[1:34:50] creates waves and these waves go boom
[1:34:53] and they hit your ear hits the eard drum
[1:34:56] creates some vibrations and your brain
[1:34:58] interpretat interprets those little
[1:35:01] little electrical signals boom and you
[1:35:02] hear amazing why because word went into
[1:35:06] the air you didn't see it but it did
[1:35:09] there's power in that word that came
[1:35:13] forth out of my lips how much more if my
[1:35:17] words can penetrate at a around you
[1:35:19] cannot see and land on your ears to
[1:35:21] Dingle a little eard jum how much more
[1:35:23] the word of God send some Shock wve into
[1:35:27] another
[1:35:33] dimension but Abraham's words but Bram
[1:35:36] says before when that old body that she
[1:35:38] had the first body had had to be changed
[1:35:41] in order to produce a son he says you
[1:35:44] get it the body couldn't do it so it'll
[1:35:46] have to be changed and the words that
[1:35:49] Abraham would have kept bringing and
[1:35:51] speaking and I don't know when but at
[1:35:53] some point something started to take
[1:35:55] hold because Sarah's body started to
[1:35:59] [Applause]
[1:36:01] change she had been young already when
[1:36:03] the eloh Elohim came and said at the
[1:36:06] time of life appointed you're going to
[1:36:07] have a baby she had to already be
[1:36:09] capable of a baby she wasn't 95 well all
[1:36:12] right in N9 months I'm going to have a
[1:36:14] baby
[1:36:17] no so something had started to already
[1:36:20] starting to
[1:36:21] change because of the word that they had
[1:36:24] been fellowshipping on oh yeah there you
[1:36:27] go and at some point the first change
[1:36:29] happened right oh Sarah you lost a
[1:36:33] wrinkle no ter oh yeah I'm sure of it
[1:36:38] you know you look straighter you look a
[1:36:39] little bit more straight there uh Abram
[1:36:42] you sure yeah you're you're not quite
[1:36:44] you know really hey it's starting to
[1:36:47] take
[1:36:49] hold yeah and you know what that did PA
[1:36:52] ignited the faith and then they kept
[1:36:55] walking into it and walking into it and
[1:36:57] then the promise started to arrive and
[1:36:59] her body started to change why because a
[1:37:03] voice From Another Dimension actually
[1:37:06] started to
[1:37:08] penetrate say where's the quat for that
[1:37:10] well B says now in this room I got to
[1:37:13] shed the coat cuz tugging on my
[1:37:16] microphone thank you
[1:37:19] bu BR says this room now is coming human
[1:37:24] beings forms of human beings passing
[1:37:25] through here all around voices singing
[1:37:27] in this room right now but you see you
[1:37:29] are only limited to your senses to a
[1:37:31] certain per of sight but you can take a
[1:37:33] crystal and a tube and a television so
[1:37:35] forth and he says you can condense it
[1:37:36] and you can start you could bring those
[1:37:38] signals to manifestation he said that
[1:37:40] are HID from our eyes the same thing is
[1:37:42] passing through here now he said and so
[1:37:44] is God here and the angels and someday
[1:37:46] it'll be just as much reality as
[1:37:49] television or anything else and so the
[1:37:51] word has been here all the time
[1:37:54] amen it just required a vessel at a
[1:37:57] specific season to be able to receive it
[1:38:00] for that certain hour Sarah and Abraham
[1:38:02] were the vessels of that moment when
[1:38:04] that word was spoke said Abraham you're
[1:38:06] going to have a son and it hit a vessel
[1:38:09] Works hit a certain vessel and it
[1:38:11] started to change
[1:38:14] it hence a word in this day was spoken
[1:38:19] the voice of the king echoed in this
[1:38:22] hour to what to hit and penetrate some
[1:38:25] beings here and start a
[1:38:28] [Applause]
[1:38:30] change what is it it's the Thundering of
[1:38:35] the
[1:38:37] king and I'm just so thankful I got the
[1:38:40] little
[1:38:43] receiver that's ready to
[1:38:47] receive how grateful I am for the grace
[1:38:51] of God what about um

[1:39:38] demon trying to oh that's just man it
[1:39:39] ain't just man it is God that's placing
[1:39:42] those different subjects do you know how
[1:39:44] many verses are in the scripture Lord
[1:39:46] where do you want me to where do I go
[1:39:47] what's your leading what's your mind I
[1:39:49] mean come on come on just tell anywhere
[1:39:51] Lord just this scripture you know
[1:39:53] certain message whereever anything know
[1:39:54] and and and the same scriptures the same
[1:39:57] I have the same quote that brother Tom
[1:39:58] preached last night the exact same one
[1:40:01] oh come on yeah I had to wrestle through
[1:40:03] that okay so I'm just telling I'm just
[1:40:04] preaching myself right
[1:40:07] now yeah preachers get preach to too
[1:40:10] even by themselves gyrus placed in a
[1:40:14] position and I can say you know gyrus he
[1:40:17] was there he came to the master and he
[1:40:20] was needing a real move of God he was
[1:40:22] trying to get there and if you want to
[1:40:24] go into the scripture you can actually
[1:40:25] read where gyrus there was the people
[1:40:27] were thronging and he had been actually
[1:40:29] already listening to the words of Jesus
[1:40:31] and he was you know almost a bit of a
[1:40:32] secret believer really and so but he was
[1:40:34] in the midst of the Pharisees and the
[1:40:35] scribes and and he was hearing a lot
[1:40:37] about what they said about it be he's a
[1:40:39] fortune teller he's of the prince of the
[1:40:41] Devils he don't believe nothing what
[1:40:42] he's doing he just a bunch of a bunch of
[1:40:44] hypnotism and he heard a lot of theya
[1:40:46] gyus heard a lot about what they say I
[1:40:48] don't care what realm you're in someone
[1:40:49] hearing a lot about this and a lot about
[1:40:50] that and believe sign that and this that
[1:40:52] and the other there's a lot of they say
[1:40:53] but gyus something
[1:40:55] inside something's right there there
[1:40:57] something true about what he's speaking
[1:40:59] and so he's kind of silently going along
[1:41:01] but then gyrus had a need in his house
[1:41:04] something hit home H God can cause
[1:41:06] something to happen because he's needing
[1:41:08] to drive you to the feet of the master
[1:41:10] and so he allows a certain circumstance
[1:41:12] to pull you from what they say to what
[1:41:14] he says here's dyus and he's getting
[1:41:17] pulled into the crowd cuz now he's a
[1:41:19] little bit desperate so gyus now is is
[1:41:22] walking through the crowd and and if if
[1:41:24] if you turn to it I don't have we'll try
[1:41:26] and save time so I won't do that but
[1:41:27] here he's walking up to Jesus he's
[1:41:29] trying to get there and just as he gets
[1:41:32] there he's trying to get there a little
[1:41:34] lady presses through that's right and
[1:41:38] stops the situation that's right okay
[1:41:41] and in that span of time he's like he's
[1:41:44] trying to get there and now a little
[1:41:46] lady's gone through she's touched the H
[1:41:47] of His Garment and now everything is
[1:41:49] changed and he's there and she she she
[1:41:51] gets Jesus deals with her kn focuses on
[1:41:54] her attention gyrus was there and now
[1:41:56] everything delays and in that moment a
[1:41:58] messenger comes and
[1:41:59] gyrus she's
[1:42:02] dead don't don't bother the master it's
[1:42:06] no
[1:42:10] use scripture says while he yet spake
[1:42:13] he's talking to Jesus now to the lady
[1:42:16] Jesus now dealing with someone else's
[1:42:17] need he's turned his attention away and
[1:42:20] he meets her and while he's speaking to
[1:42:23] her her news comes your daughter's dead
[1:42:26] don't trouble the
[1:42:30] master now sometimes you might feel that
[1:42:34] way it's like God's attention just turn

[1:43:04] heard
[1:43:06] it oh he's looking at the lady with the
[1:43:10] with the knee to touch His Garment the
[1:43:12] blood issue I think it was and she's
[1:43:13] there and and suddenly gyrus is over

[1:51:23] good you know Jehoshaphat said you know
[1:51:27] when God speaks his word when the king
[1:51:29] speaks he don't never
[1:51:31] forget okay when he speaks his word to
[1:51:34] you and anchors deep down you say you
[1:51:36] know what God just spoke to me he said
[1:51:38] such and such he's revealed that to me
[1:51:40] he's healed me he's delivered me he's

[1:51:44] it because God never
[1:51:47] forgets okay God's not a god forgets I
[1:51:50] can Jehosaphat there sat at a time but
[1:51:52] brandom goes through it I'll just try
[1:51:53] and paraphrase here and he was there
[1:51:55] when they called from Mah he was with
[1:51:56] Abra Ahab and and they were they were in
[1:51:59] a battle and they were want to get you
[1:52:01] know word from the prophet well they had
[1:52:03] all the prophets that they they had out
[1:52:05] there and and he said well is there
[1:52:06] another one you know joh we know the
[1:52:08] story and and Ahab of course you he
[1:52:10] doesn't like the prophet he always says
[1:52:11] something that that I don't like to hear
[1:52:12] and he speaks against me and they ended
[1:52:14] up bringing him down well they said they
[1:52:15] sent a runner out there to get Micaiah
[1:52:18] he said you know I got to put a bug in
[1:52:20] your ear now he said you say the same
[1:52:21] thing that they say
[1:52:23] this is the runner telling the prophet
[1:52:24] what to say you just say just like they
[1:52:26] say because I tell you that all 400 of
[1:52:28] them ecclesiastics is saying we should
[1:52:30] go this way so you just must say the
[1:52:31] same thing come on messenger you're
[1:52:33] going to have to say what the rest says
[1:52:34] you're just going to have to fall in
[1:52:35] line with with what the rest of
[1:52:37] denominations are preaching forget that
[1:52:38] serpent Seed doctrine forget being
[1:52:40] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ if
[1:52:41] you can just fall in line with what they
[1:52:43] all say then everything will be all
[1:52:45] right
[1:52:48] oh M said as the Lord God Lives I'll
[1:52:52] just say what he puts in my
[1:52:54] mouth there's a prophet for you there's
[1:52:56] a minority yep sorry I like that he said
[1:52:59] I like it uhhuh amen one Prophet to
[1:53:01] another he said so they brought him down
[1:53:03] there Ahab was having a raging spell and
[1:53:05] get that Holy Roller among us down here
[1:53:07] now he's going to ruin our congregation
[1:53:09] and so he's all you know spewing some
[1:53:11] different some harsh words there and he
[1:53:12] said I'm going to go he goes I'm just
[1:53:14] going to Micaiah said I'm going to stay
[1:53:16] right with the word so M he saidwell
[1:53:18] should I go up he says well give me the
[1:53:21] night to think about it I'm going to go
[1:53:23] talk to the Lord he says all right so
[1:53:26] then he comes back he says how long
[1:53:28] though will I
[1:53:30] say just tell me the truth now you know
[1:53:32] he he actually got a word back you don't
[1:53:34] go up there oh wait a second that
[1:53:36] sounded too easy it's not quite like
[1:53:39] you Ahab actually had a de bit of sense
[1:53:42] he said well go on up but I saw Israel
[1:53:45] scattered his sheep all right so we know
[1:53:48] this here we know this account that this
[1:53:50] is what Mah said to them and he said you
[1:53:52] know he was staying but says with the
[1:53:54] word of God he said so Micaiah he said
[1:53:56] so what could Micaiah say any different
[1:53:58] because he said so because Elijah the
[1:54:00] prophet had already prophesied so years
[1:54:04] before a word had already been issued
[1:54:06] out on Ahab Ahab you're going to die so
[1:54:10] here you say you're going to go up
[1:54:11] you're going to prosper not M couldn't
[1:54:12] say anything different than what the
[1:54:14] word had already stated God had not
[1:54:16] forgotten of what his Prophet had said
[1:54:18] and so M now comes and said sorry but I
[1:54:20] see you scattered his sheep because he
[1:54:22] said Mah could not say anything
[1:54:24] different about what the word said and
[1:54:27] so here something transpires and God
[1:54:29] remembers what he said way down the road
[1:54:31] behind in history and just some a little
[1:54:33] lonely Little Soldier man just threw up
[1:54:35] his bow into the air as the scripture
[1:54:38] says on a venture and God's word that
[1:54:40] had spoken by a prophet took hold of the
[1:54:43] Venture arrow and brought it to where
[1:54:45] Ahab because God could not forget the
[1:54:48] word that he spoke by a prophet and took
[1:54:51] a random Arrow in the air and said sorry
[1:54:53] I have but your dead
[1:54:55] man if God could remember that do you
[1:54:58] not think he remember every single
[1:55:01] promise in that book every word you just
[1:55:04] think well I got to say a prayer tonight
[1:55:06] I'm just going to it you on a little
[1:55:07] word oh God you think it's a ventless
[1:55:11] prayer but it's not because the word
[1:55:14] grabs a hole brings it down into your
[1:55:17] heart
[1:55:19] Hallelujah God don't Venture God don't
[1:55:22] forget he remembers
[1:55:25] you when you get down on your knees say
[1:55:28] oh God I have a certain situation you
[1:55:31] think well does he hear me yes he does
[1:55:33] he remembered when Mah got out there
[1:55:35] said sorry I can't say nothing different
[1:55:37] God said I remembered I remember my word
[1:55:40] that I said way back there thousands of
[1:55:42] years ago it still applies
[1:55:45] [Applause]
[1:55:47] today it applies right
[1:55:51] here Lord
[1:55:54] Hallelujah I don't care what Ahab said A
[1:55:57] Higher King had
[1:56:02] spoken oh my ain't no 50-50 chance and
[1:56:06] ain't no sing Russian rouette no he
[1:56:09] spoke it he means it he delivers
[1:56:13] it you just need to keep walking I can I
[1:56:18] will I do believe that's all God desires
[1:56:21] of you and
[1:56:23] that's all he desires he does not
[1:56:25] require your understanding your merits
[1:56:28] your abilities your talents he don't
[1:56:29] care about nothing he says just
[1:56:39] believe you know not
[1:56:42] everybody here's the Roar of a
[1:56:45] king as we said a little bit
[1:56:49] ago scripture said
[1:56:53] you know if everybody did then I'd have
[1:56:56] to wonder why are they not following the
[1:56:57] King's word you know if you didn't
[1:56:58] follow the king's word he was treason
[1:56:59] you know if you're going against the
[1:57:00] king I wonder how many people are
[1:57:01] committing spiritual treason in this day
[1:57:04] and hour spiritual treason was punish
[1:57:06] punished by death spiritual treason
[1:57:09] carries the same sentence we don't want
[1:57:11] to be against the word of God but so the
[1:57:13] devil clouds and if you don't have the
[1:57:15] little the seed inside you're not going
[1:57:17] to hear the king
[1:57:19] anyway John 12 says but though he had
[1:57:22] done so many miracles before them yet
[1:57:23] they believed not on him they had done
[1:57:26] many miracles so the sight of Miracles
[1:57:28] didn't change
[1:57:29] anything hey how many people saw the
[1:57:31] Miracles on brother bram's day
[1:57:33] thousands
[1:57:35] thousands did it do anything no for many
[1:57:38] it didn't do anything s so the scripture
[1:57:41] says yet they believe not that the
[1:57:43] saying of Isaiah the prophets might be
[1:57:44] fulfilled which he spake Lord who hath
[1:57:47] believed our report oh but there's a
[1:57:49] people
[1:57:52] it said when the king speaks I believe
[1:57:56] it but you know people don't go back to
[1:57:58] the source they they get told something
[1:58:01] they hear that they say and how many I
[1:58:03] wonder are content with so many they
[1:58:05] says about this message don't even go
[1:58:07] back and look for themselves you know
[1:58:07] many people come in they say oh I heard
[1:58:09] this and heard that and whatever have
[1:58:10] you ever read a message
[1:58:14] no end of story go read the message then
[1:58:17] we'll come back and talk don't even
[1:58:19] waste your
[1:58:19] words you know but not everybody you
[1:58:22] know was running to e to Solomon either
[1:58:24] if I could say it that way I don't think
[1:58:26] everyone was really eager to hear his
[1:58:27] voice but there was one that was eager
[1:58:30] many came many heard they heard what did
[1:58:32] you hear this I heard this happen here
[1:58:33] they said this is happening in the court
[1:58:35] and this they had all a whole lot of
[1:58:36] things but there was one little lady who
[1:58:37] said you know what I don't care what you
[1:58:39] say I need to go there for myself I
[1:58:41] actually need to hear it from my li his
[1:58:44] lips to my ear I need to go to the
[1:58:46] source on the matter because what you
[1:58:48] say and you say it's all different all
[1:58:49] convoluted but I got to get there so she
[1:58:52] got her camels and all her different
[1:58:53] things and she packed herself up and the
[1:58:55] queen of the South the word says shall
[1:58:57] rise up into judgment with this
[1:58:59] generation who and shall condemn it for
[1:59:02] she came from the uttermost parts of the
[1:59:04] earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon why
[1:59:06] because there were some that
[1:59:09] didn't all right some that
[1:59:14] didn't but she yearned I need one word I
[1:59:18] just need to get in his presence I need
[1:59:20] to hear what that word says amen have a
[1:59:22] great need have a desperate situation if
[1:59:24] the king could just speak to me all will
[1:59:27] be well everything will be made right
[1:59:29] just I need to get there and she was
[1:59:30] willing to get there and you know I was
[1:59:32] thinking you know I don't have time to
[1:59:33] even go there you know I was thinking
[1:59:35] about the two little mothers what wisdom
[1:59:37] Solomon
[1:59:38] had those was two little mothers that
[1:59:40] came there and said oh this is my baby
[1:59:42] no this is my baby and they saided both
[1:59:45] claiming the same baby because one had
[1:59:46] died and she said Each one was saying to
[1:59:48] the other one and so here it is is
[1:59:51] confounding this is in scripture you
[1:59:53] know just sitting there in the word you
[1:59:54] said well you know just no no no
[1:59:56] actually I was reading a little bit and
[1:59:57] I thought my that's actually kind of
[1:59:59] incredible because the word in that hour
[2:00:02] could discern the situation both were
[2:00:05] claiming to have
[2:00:07] life so close it would deceive the very
[2:00:10] elect if it were possible two Mas say no
[2:00:13] that's my baby no that's my life that's
[2:00:15] that's my know word word saying well
[2:00:17] just wait a
[2:00:19] second let's just divide it let's take
[2:00:22] the word and divide it and one was
[2:00:25] content for a watered down gospel for a
[2:00:29] lifeless word he was content to take it
[2:00:32] and say that's okay that's fine but the
[2:00:34] other one that was so that wanted it not
[2:00:37] the so close but the real true blue M
[2:00:40] she said no no don't I need that whole
[2:00:43] word I need everything I need from A to
[2:00:45] Z I need Genesis the Revelation I need
[2:00:48] the whole gospel don't cut it in half
[2:00:54] Solomon says you're the real one you're
[2:00:57] the one that has a seat inside of you
[2:00:59] you're the real mama amen we don't want
[2:01:01] to water down cut and half gospel we
[2:01:04] want the word from the king in this
[2:01:07] hour
[2:01:11] Hallelujah that's not just a story in
[2:01:14] scripture that's this day because there
[2:01:16] are people that do not
[2:01:20] care but not
[2:01:23] bride keep the life I need mechanics and
[2:01:27] Dynamics I need it all together I need
[2:01:30] that baby word to burst forth and cry
[2:01:33] out
[2:01:37] yes
[2:01:41] Hallelujah because there's a little
[2:01:43] Queen from the
[2:01:47] south
[2:01:49] South that believes
[2:01:53] every word and rise up she has rose up
[2:01:57] so I can tell you there's a little Queen
[2:02:01] here you'll fellowship with that Queen
[2:02:03] of the South because this queen of the
[2:02:05] South says we believe to we got to the
[2:02:08] feet because a greater than Solomon came
[2:02:11] in our day we're Ken we're both from the
[2:02:16] south
[2:02:19] amen you know the little Queen
[2:02:22] has a special
[2:02:25] position because a queen is given
[2:02:32] Authority a servant is not given
[2:02:35] Authority just a soldier little private
[2:02:38] down there they have certain duties but
[2:02:41] the queen is a different
[2:02:44] story and it it's really
[2:02:46] embarrassing when you presume Authority
[2:02:52] I don't know if anybody's ever been in
[2:02:53] them situation when you know you step a
[2:02:55] little bit above your pay grade or
[2:02:57] you're you know see somebody it's like
[2:02:59] oh I'll just step out of the Zone it's
[2:03:03] kind of awkward when someone presumes
[2:03:06] something steps out there he like hey
[2:03:08] bud and that's not your call
[2:03:11] oh he's like yeah I'm out of here
[2:03:15] presume is terrible to venture without
[2:03:17] Authority is what that is and brother
[2:03:19] Brown says presume he says I got the
[2:03:21] Webers says it's to venture without
[2:03:23] actual Authority or to take for granted
[2:03:25] amen and so often I'd say almost always
[2:03:29] the they Sayers are venturing without
[2:03:32] Authority they often step out there and
[2:03:34] they start to say something you're like
[2:03:36] do you even have a right to say that
[2:03:38] well they say it but no no you're
[2:03:39] venturing out there you're presuming
[2:03:41] because they don't have the authority
[2:03:43] but the queen has the authority and
[2:03:46] she's a queen because she's received the
[2:03:49] seed from the King
[2:03:52] yes the queen sits in that position
[2:03:55] she's received life she's been United
[2:03:58] with a king therefore she's Queen and
[2:04:01] now she sits at a ranking level and can
[2:04:05] utter out or Usher
[2:04:10] Authority a certain Vagabond Jew
[2:04:13] Exorcist took upon them to call over
[2:04:15] them which had evil spirits in the name
[2:04:17] of the Lord Jesus saying we adure thee
[2:04:19] by Jesus whom Paul preaches and they
[2:04:21] were seven sons of ska a Jew a chief of
[2:04:23] priests which did so and the evil spirit
[2:04:25] said Jesus I know Paul I know but who
[2:04:29] are
[2:04:31] you that was venturing without
[2:04:36] Authority they presumed they had
[2:04:39] something inside of them that they could
[2:04:41] step out there and say I adure Thee in
[2:04:43] the name of the Lord Jesus they were
[2:04:45] speaking
[2:04:47] words so actually is it just the words
[2:04:51] oh
[2:04:52] but a life inside has to be present to
[2:04:56] bring the power behind it and that one
[2:04:59] there was saying I adure Thee had
[2:05:01] nothing inside so when he spoke the
[2:05:04] words the spirit said sorry but I know
[2:05:07] Jesus and I know Paul he is the king of
[2:05:11] kings he's filled with his life and his
[2:05:13] Spirit therefore speaks with authority
[2:05:16] but who are
[2:05:19] you that was a scary moment for him
[2:05:23] because scripture then says and the man
[2:05:25] whom the evil spirit was leaped on them
[2:05:27] and overcame them and prevailed against
[2:05:29] them so they fled out of the house naked
[2:05:31] and wounded you don't think the enemy
[2:05:34] knows oh he knows he knows exactly so
[2:05:39] there's no you be very careful you want
[2:05:42] to make sure there's
[2:05:44] life that's why being filled with the
[2:05:47] spirit of the Living God life inside of
[2:05:50] you is so critical because when you come
[2:05:53] up against the wall and you got to speak
[2:05:55] to the storm you want to know inside
[2:05:58] there's
[2:06:04] Authority that's why this message is so
[2:06:06] critical because this word of this hour
[2:06:09] is what is the life of this hour that is
[2:06:11] inside of you that can bring the power
[2:06:13] behind the
[2:06:14] [Applause]
[2:06:18] word my
[2:06:22] it's your
[2:06:23] identification this word is your
[2:06:26] identification so when you do and a
[2:06:29] spirit in that realm says wait a second
[2:06:31] I know this person oh not
[2:06:35] you because me and this word are tied
[2:06:40] together that's why I stand to you in
[2:06:42] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you
[2:06:45] need to be able to identify with the
[2:06:46] word of this day because that's who
[2:06:48] gives you that's where your Authority
[2:06:50] comes from but brand says watch him I
[2:06:52] like this how bravely how majestically
[2:06:54] he stood before his critics he said
[2:06:56] destroy this Temple and I'll pray the
[2:06:58] father and see what he does about it
[2:07:00] destroy this Temple and Rise it up in
[2:07:01] three days not I hope so not I'm going
[2:07:04] to try I will do it he says the same
[2:07:10] scripture right here yes sir that said
[2:07:13] he would raise up his body gives us the
[2:07:16] authority the
[2:07:19] power in my name they shall cast out
[2:07:22] Devils they'll speak with new tongues if
[2:07:23] they take up serpents or deadly things
[2:07:25] drink deadly things they won't harm them
[2:07:26] and if they lay hands on the sick they
[2:07:28] shall recover if it raised him from the
[2:07:31] dead in three days is this word
[2:07:34] importent
[2:07:36] today come on oh I expected a louder
[2:07:39] Amen on that if the word raised up
[2:07:42] Christ from the dead in three days I
[2:07:45] repeat is it impotent
[2:07:48] today never because it's his word and
[2:07:51] he's a yesterday today and forever so
[2:07:54] there's Authority in his bride that
[2:07:56] carry the same word so he said lay hands
[2:07:58] on the sick they shall
[2:08:08] recover that's why this word thundered
[2:08:10] out I don't have time to go through
[2:08:13] it the Thundering of this word in this
[2:08:15] age is a king thundered out breaking the
[2:08:18] seals of this hour to what reveal
[2:08:20] himself to you and I amen it was the
[2:08:23] king speaking in this age not just a
[2:08:26] prophet it was the king through a
[2:08:31] prophet that's why this quote says that
[2:08:33] you heard last night brother Bram says
[2:08:36] as brother Tom red and I'm going to read
[2:08:37] it again because somebody here didn't
[2:08:39] hear it a momentary consideration of
[2:08:41] church history as he goes through he
[2:08:42] says they organized and again the pure
[2:08:44] word was lost for organizations tends to
[2:08:47] dogma and Creeds they could no longer
[2:08:49] speak for God they sent God that God
[2:08:52] sent Wesley he was the voice of the word
[2:08:53] in the day he the people took his
[2:08:55] Revelation from God became the living
[2:08:57] epistle read an knowable men for their
[2:08:58] generation Methodist failed God raised
[2:09:01] up others so it has gone on through the
[2:09:03] years until this last day there's again
[2:09:06] another people in the L who under their
[2:09:09] Messenger as you heard will be the final
[2:09:12] voice to the final age yes sir the
[2:09:15] church is no longer the mouthpiece if
[2:09:18] God it's its own mouth
[2:09:26] piece it's own mouthpiece he say well
[2:09:29] brother
[2:09:30] Michael um do you have scripture for
[2:09:34] that well I'm going to take you through
[2:09:37] a journey through a story that you know
[2:09:40] so well as we come to the near the
[2:09:43] end and it's a story in the Book of
[2:09:46] Esther all right we know the story of
[2:09:48] Esther and this little chosen Queen
[2:09:51] and she gets selected by the king and
[2:09:54] she was out to get destroyed by a demon
[2:09:56] devil and there she comes and and the
[2:09:59] and the King which had power by his word
[2:10:01] could issue out a Word of Deliverance
[2:10:02] but she had to come and surrender
[2:10:04] herself to the word of that day and she
[2:10:06] had to come before the king and
[2:10:07] surrender all her life and she had to go
[2:10:09] to the feet and she fasted and she
[2:10:10] prayed she trembled and she I don't know
[2:10:12] cuz if I go there I might die and she
[2:10:14] says the words of I perish I perish but
[2:10:16] I'm going to go before the king and and
[2:10:18] she walks hesitantly into the chambers
[2:10:20] the doors open open up and there the ler
[2:10:22] standing there in the whole crowd and
[2:10:24] the whole throne room just goes into Ash
[2:10:27] well she's insane she's going to die
[2:10:31] Esther goes through this process this
[2:10:33] gut churning dying time to go before the
[2:10:35] king and be presented before the word
[2:10:38] and the word gets extended to her and
[2:10:40] she's accepted that's
[2:10:44] right and then hmon she goes through the
[2:10:47] Banquets we know the story hmon is then
[2:10:49] destroyed and hung on the gall
[2:10:52] and it's like oh okaying take back the
[2:10:54] decree well I can't do that CU once I've
[2:10:57] spoken my word I cannot pull it
[2:11:01] back and the day you eat thereof the day
[2:11:04] you
[2:11:04] die or revoke it I can't I spoke it the
[2:11:09] decree went
[2:11:13] forth so he could
[2:11:15] not and so now Esther in the scripture
[2:11:19] approaches the throne as second time
[2:11:23] yeah and I'm so I I love the scripture
[2:11:26] because when she walks in in chapter 8:3
[2:11:29] she's now walking knowing the king
[2:11:33] accepts
[2:11:34] her there's no fasting and praying oh my
[2:11:37] God Lord are you are you going to accept
[2:11:38] me do you know my need I just oh is he
[2:11:40] going to I got to go before the throne
[2:11:42] again fast and pray please because I no
[2:11:44] no no none of that actually exist she
[2:11:46] just walks into the throne
[2:11:54] open she knew she's accepted Hallelujah
[2:11:58] she knows she's accepted she don't need
[2:12:01] to hesitate she don't need to wonder is
[2:12:03] he going to hear my prayer is he going
[2:12:05] to accept me am I going to be dead
[2:12:06] before him oh no what is he going to
[2:12:08] know just walk in Esther just approach
[2:12:10] the word just say Lord I have a need I'm
[2:12:13] here he says Esther I just want to to
[2:12:16] come into my Throne Room how come you
[2:12:18] didn't come earlier how come you didn't
[2:12:20] get on your knees sooner I'm ready to
[2:12:22] meet your
[2:12:23] need cuz she was Queen and she knew
[2:12:28] it that's what God is Desiring for you
[2:12:31] to be Queen you you're Queen he's just
[2:12:34] waiting for you to know it and to
[2:12:36] actually stride into the throne room say
[2:12:38] I'm here King I have a need not
[2:12:40] disrespect but in position that's
[2:12:44] right and so now the king proclaims
[2:12:48] out a decree I can't can undo this first
[2:12:52] action so he puts out another decree can
[2:12:54] undo my law so the word of the King goes
[2:12:56] forth all the Demons of hell are given
[2:12:58] notice that a mighty conqueror has
[2:13:00] stepped on the scene risen up and the
[2:13:01] King now is coming and he's enabled the
[2:13:03] Jews to
[2:13:05] fight come on now that word has gone
[2:13:08] forth he raised from the dead he said
[2:13:10] hey I've been risen I've taken the keys
[2:13:12] of death and Hell In The Grave I've
[2:13:13] given you the power and authority go out
[2:13:15] there and fight sir yes sir so you now
[2:13:19] are armed all the Jews there are
[2:13:21] including the queen armed now to go
[2:13:23] forth and the word of the king and so
[2:13:24] now after this was all over the Jews had
[2:13:26] been defeated there was Joy or the Jews
[2:13:29] had defeated so many 75,000 actually and
[2:13:31] there was joy and
[2:13:33] rejoicing okay Esther n then Esther the
[2:13:37] Queen the daughter of Abel and Mori the

[2:13:53] authority oh my goodness to confirm the
[2:13:56] second letter of purum to let the Jews
[2:13:58] know the time of rejoicing is
[2:14:03] here true juilee has sounded and we have

[2:21:08] in the womb I Sanctified you me yes
[2:21:11] don't question
[2:21:14] [Music]
[2:21:17] it I ordained you
[2:21:23] but the Lord said unto me you know what
[2:21:25] the scripture says actually then I said
[2:21:27] Lord God behold I cannot speak for I'm a
[2:21:32] child there's no here
[2:21:37] tonight but the Lord said unto me say
[2:21:40] not I am a child for Thou shalt go to
[2:21:43] all that I shall send thee and
[2:21:45] whatsoever I command thee Thou shalt
[2:21:47] speak he says Be not Afraid of their FA
[2:21:50] for I am with thee to deliver Thee
[2:21:52] sayith the Lord then the Lord put forth
[2:21:54] his hand touched my mouth and the Lord
[2:21:56] said unto me behold I have put my words
[2:22:00] in thy
[2:22:02] [Applause]

[2:22:24] speak why could I speak why could I
[2:22:26] speak why could I speak why could I
[2:22:28] speak why CHR I speak you think God's
[2:22:30] trying to tell us something just maybe
[2:22:33] he's telling us it's your time Queen
[2:22:35] it's your time Queen speak the
[2:22:38] word Moses spoke the word God he goes
[2:22:41] through it and we don't have time
[2:22:42] because I called him musician so now I
[2:22:43] got a time crunch I'm purposely done but
[2:22:46] brother Bram
[2:22:48] said the seed
[2:22:51] Moses born and then he was afterwards he
[2:22:53] brought to the place where he was
[2:22:54] anointed he said the seed laying there
[2:22:57] with an intellectual
[2:22:58] conception but with all the faith that
[2:23:00] he was born to deliver this people yet
[2:23:02] it never come to life until the light
[2:23:04] from the burning bush flashed across it
[2:23:07] until he seen not something he read
[2:23:08] about but something he seen with his
[2:23:10] eyes something that spoke to him and he
[2:23:15] spoke back to it oh how that did bring
[2:23:19] things to life
[2:23:23] maybe tonight I tell you God spoke but
[2:23:27] now you need to speak back to
[2:23:29] him because it's a combination right he
[2:23:33] speaks to Moses Moses spoke back to him
[2:23:36] and butter brown him said it oh and then
[2:23:38] how did that bring things to life maybe
[2:23:42] you're like well I'm pretty dead it's
[2:23:44] okay we just heard Lazarus come from the
[2:23:46] grave because the king spoke so I don't

[2:24:20] killed a thousand with the Jawbone and
[2:24:22] actually says and it came to pass when
[2:24:23] he had yet made an end of
[2:24:28] speaking oh while he was swinging he is
[2:24:32] speaking I have killed thousands he's
[2:24:35] swinging scripture says with the JW on
[2:24:37] of an ass heaps upon heaps demons upon
[2:24:40] demons that he's swinging and
[2:24:43] slaying he was speaking the word in
[2:24:46] action
[2:24:52] when Jesus met Legion and
[2:24:54] spoke but Braham says it wasn't Jesus
[2:24:58] crying he said it was the devil's
[2:25:03] crying
