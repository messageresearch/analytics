he's a promise keeper he's away maker a man he's been that for me and I know he'll be that for you hallelujah and let's turn to job chapter five and verse eight amen as I was looking on the things that I have this morning brother Andrew Spencer sent me the scripture went right along with what I was looking at and I said thank you I'm gonna steal that he said well I felt like you needed that and I said well I did so amen job chapter five and verse eight said I would seek unto God and unto God well would I commit my calls which to do with great things and unsearchable marvelous things without number a man would let you be seated this morning he meant I I was very much blessed by the service on Wednesday night I believe it was a prophetic service Amen with with Amen with prophetic words that were spoken amen not just word from a mortal man but God speaking through a mortal man amen we really appreciate brother Ron and brother Andrew for coming and being with us but you know many thought that he came because my mom was in this area in the situation that she's been in but actually the plans were already in place for him to come he meant he had you can go back and listen to brother Andrew spoke about it somewhat on the on the Wednesday but you can go look at the service brother ron spoke a couple of Sundays ago on I must get to Jesus and and he and him began to realize that he spoke that he wanted to speak it amen from him his own life very personal because you know you can use stories of Jarius or or the woman who touched the hem of His garment all those things but until you realize that you have to get to Jesus and and he said as he spoke things of how they would take people 1718 hours to go and be in the meetings of brother Branham or to be at Jesus's feet whatever it took to get there he began to realize he was speaking of his own self and and he felt that he had to come here amen and and just to have a moment with the Lord and and do and do the impossible it it was impossible to think that he can make that kind of journey but hey man we heard the service Wednesday night and they got right in the car and left and he they went drove to Meridian and about five hours from here got a motel got up the next morning made it home about Thursday about 9:30 their time or so ten o'clock their time and he got the next morning went to work with his boys amen and God has been moving in possible situations and you know I actually actually was looking upon the things again the next couple of days as I was pondering the things that were spoke Wednesday night I knew it was not something that ought to go in one ear and out the other I don't believe any service should be that way but it just seemed to be the Lord was speaking some specific things and so looking upon them I went back and I begin to read the chapter of Daniel where Daniel went to the lion's den and you know in Daniel 6 it was the presidents of the kingdom and the governors and the princes and the counselors and the captains that consulted together against Daniel and it just spoke in my heart they said read on a few more lines read on a few more verses and I kept reading and I'm beginning to read as Daniel came out of the lion's den and and then in chapter 6 and verse 24 said the king commanded that they brought those men which had accused Daniel and they cast them into the den of lions them their children their wives and the Lions had the mastery of them and break all their bones into pieces or ever or ever they came out at the bottom of the den and the Lord spoke to me and said is there time to have a turn in the lion's den hey man I'm looking forward to that moment I believe when cancer goes into that lion's den and we're not talking about natural lines we're talking about the line of the tribe of Judah hey man the root and offspring of David when they go in they're not coming out because he's going to be more than victorious a membrane bleeds are going in that lines dim whatever spirit this morning has their moment they don't have their moment in that lines den with the king of kings and the Lord of lords amen and so this morning as we as you know we've been in this battle since last time over a week now with sister Karen a week ago Thursday night had a tremendous brain bleeding and the doctors actually was not given much hope it was not I actually wanted spoke to brother Joe as I I was on my way home from being out of town with my wife our anniversary and and the doctors was I was trying to call brother Joe cuz I knew you know being mend and he was able to maybe get in there to where she was at because of the kovat situation there not allowing that anybody to come in and so he called me and I let him know what was going on and he was able to run down there and see her and the doctors told him said in which he did not relay this to us at the time but he said the doctors told him she might live five minutes just might live a few moments five years but there's not much hope but you know we immediately begin to turn our eyes from what we see and look past what we see you have to look to the unseen I don't care if it's a toothache or what it is you need to look to the unseen to look that God has paid the price God has given a man the answer for it and God is more than able yet more than able for whatever the need is and this morning as we begin to speak about these things the thought begin to come on my heart because I begin to think about what day we're living in and what time we're living in and what what what what we're seeing around us and you know the devil always wants to point us to all the negative negativity and all the things that's going on around us and how bad this is and how bad that is and get our eyes off of the most amazing time there's ever been to live him amen it's a time the moment of the coming of the Lord and and and you know as as brother I just want us to go back for a moment brother Ron came down on Monday because as the situation begin to make a turn very quickly Thursday Friday she lay there without looked like any kind of response or anything Saturday she'd begin to come back and the Sunday should begin to come back and on Saturday my dad texted me said look look I'm fixing the message brother Ron I think he still has to come it's just the devil is trying to block this and I said you know I said you're absolutely right I said actually when I was on my way up to our little getaway with me and my wife I was speaking to brother Ron he was relaying to me all the things that had taken place and how he had to get to Jesus and he stopped and he said now you watch the devil is gonna try to block it and the devil did everything he could to block it amen but as we heard Wednesday night the devil can do everything he can but he don't have enough he meant because if he had enough he'd bring enough but he don't have enough hallelujah hey man and so we he came Monday and we had prayer Monday night but on Tuesday we had a little time together at the at the lake house and and and with the brothers brother Aaron brother Michael myself and he and the ones that came brother Ron dad and my two boys and we began to as we after we ate lunch we sat down and in the little living room there and begin to just you could tell the conversation immediately went to the supernatural and the things of God were doing and how God was moving and how God was changing and how God was operating even in the middle of darkness and and you know as time went on we said I don't know sit there for several hours speaking about the things of God and you feel the atmosphere begin to build and and brother Aaron had to go and he got up to leave and my dad said no we're gonna have a time of Prayer and so he brother injury was also out on the phone and so he called him in and we knelt down and I'm gonna tell you the power of God fell on that place and begin to move in supernatural realm God began to speak and sit so in the situation we got through praying therefore brother Ronon and just that week my dad had been out there preparing for their coming and with them with my two boys and Luke had expressed to him what was on his heart how he was seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and my dad just said Luke it's your turn it's your time to receive it and we grabbed ahold of him brother Ron jumped up out of his seat and we begin to pray and we give the Lord just met Luke they're in a spiritual way and changed his life forever hey man we sat down for a moment to catch a breath and brother Ron sitting across from me I looked at him and Andrew standing there standing there kind of with his hands holding his head looking down hatton mood and brother Ron looked at me and he looked at Andrew and he looked at me he looked up at Andrew and he said Andrew you need the same thing come here and he began to pray for him and and as the Spirit of God hit Andrew Andrew raised up his hands they screamed out it's my turn it's my turn hallelujah and this is where I actually came to on this thought the days of miracles it's our turn it's our turn amen you know I was actually just getting the report right now sister Karen she had a good night and let me let me say every day has been a progression towards health every day sure there's been times it kind of waned and you wondered and the devil try to point out every negative sign but every day has been a good day hey man they said last night she had a good night with no issues and remains in the NICU but I just got word they're moving her to a regular room right now it's continually to improve hallelujah he said to be more specific she has improved to the point she's speaking with clarity she's moving all limbs her memory is good her eyesight is good she's aware of all of her surroundings even the nurses out in the hall she's aware of them she's conversing with them she has no drawing in her face or any of her limbs she's an absolute miracle the brain and her blood the bleed in her brain had pushed the right side of her brain out of place and put a lot of pressure if there's a weakness on one side it might is very minimal but we have so much to be thankful for and have come a long ways in a very short time and this morning she'd been sitting up for over in an hour I don't think we can really wrap our minds around the miracle that's taking place a week ago Thursday merit medical professionals advise my dad said we do you as prepare for death do you want to resuscitate or do you do you want her to have this surgery we don't give much hope but he said we have accepted nothing but victory we have sent before us a completely held personal healed person and step-by-step we're walking into that vision what an awesome God we serve hallelujah praise be to the king of kings and the Lord of lords that's my god amen and I was reading this this morning I was me guard this week as I began to think on these things if you remember brother brother David mayors spoke right before our services and he said the time is now for the miraculous for the phenomenal amen and I began to look for that to where he may have brought come from but got that inspiration and I found a quote brother Branham said I believe that the ages come now the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the Spirit power in signs and wonders this great pouring out of God's Spirit in this last day it's the thing that's bringing faith into the people that will take a rapture I don't know yeah hey man you know where people want to say well a days of miracles pass if you notice they don't say that the miracles don't exist or God didn't perform miracles they say that the day has passed but I want you to tell you I won't tell I'm do you understand one thing this morning we are living in that day we are living in the day that any moment the greatest miracle that it can ever take place the change of this whole body missing limbs to come back again gray hair to turn back to us normal color old crepin bodies to take and be good will go back to renew to the youth amen we're living in the greatest day there's ever been hey man and I'm seeing the supernatural God moving in a supernatural people because where Jesus is there is miracles where Jesus is there is the supernatural and he promised you would be with us even in us to the ends of the world hallelujah I don't know what you're seeing you might be seeing darkness you might be seeing Laodicea in all its works you might see how hopeless but I see light shining I see the Word of God being revealed and his people and where he is there is miracles where he is there is signs and wonders where he is there is healings there's deliverance there's the baptism of the Holy Ghost where he is all things are possible hallelujah I begin to read in the first book of Acts and I want you to understand as we know Amen as well Amen well learn message members but it has to be more than a learned idea it has to be a revelation in your heart Amen we are writing another book of Acts amen they wrote a book we're writing their own book and it'll have the same signs they don't have the same wonders you don't have the same miracles you don't have because it's the same God he many Kinki if God is God he don't change Oh hallelujah this is what he says in acts 2 verse 22 he said you men of Israel hear these words he did like to have and I quote here these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know hallelujah we know he's a God of miracles how many we've seen himself heal cancer we've seen him heal no brain bleed we've seen him move in impossible situation I've seen him fill three young men when the Holy Ghost I seen him moving his people he's still moving even now he said that wasn't Jesus okay act six and verse eight and Stephen full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people act six and the people which were in one of court gave heed unto those things which Philip speak hearing and seeing the miracles which he did acts 15:12 then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them Oh hallelujah amen acts 19 11 and God wrote special miracles by the hands of Paul so miracles I know people said well I don't look for signs and I don't look for wonders well you can't take signs and wonders out of it it's there amen God produces those things every time Jesus come there's a miracle there sign a minute brother branham were talking about the angel visitation he said every time he comes something good happens Oh hallelujah this is what it's even in the church this is what he said in first Corinthians 12 7 through 11 it says but the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal four to one is given the spirit the way by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working it's in the word the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these things that one and the self same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will it's a working of the same spirit so if we got the same spirit we got the same works hallelujah amen and on what I understand by the prophet of God as he would speak he would say the days of Pentecost is here again as it was on the day of Pentecost when the power of God fell upon some unlearned man and took them over and men that were cowards men that couldn't stand the pressures of the world amen they stood up in the face of that and said this is that what the Prophet Joel spoke about Oh hallelujah hey man it's a working of miracles that's what has been released in this age the phenomenal the miraculous the baptism of the holy spirit has been released again as it was on the day of Pentecost a man just as it poured out the miraculous in the first Exodus signs and great wonders so he also came himself personally with signs and great wonders in the second Exodus also he coming to third Exodus with a miraculous but the Holy Spirit being poured out gathering to himself a people who will believe for the impossible praise the Lord the supernatural working in a supernatural people God fulfilling his word backing it up by the miraculous you say well we have the word we have the word wonderful yes we have the word it's an open word it's an open book so if it's open it opens everything that's in there but somehow people want to take all those out well we're not looking for miraculous we're not looking for signs and wonders we've got the word within the word that's who he is you can't separate him and so in turn they turned that the devil is allowed it to turn it from a man from being faith to an intellectual gospel and stripping the power of God out of the church to where people can't even believe for healing no more hatred that wouldn't believe it for healing enough say well it's that God has allowed us to come on me to work something out in my life even brother Brown said that's the biggest lie that's ever been he said the devil put that on you he said sure God allows us sometimes he said well what happens he allows it because if you say well we shall see miracles there has to be an opportunity for miracles to be so he allows things to come he allows cancer he allows things to come because he has these attributes that he wants to fulfill he wants to show you who he is personally vindicated to you [Music] Alleluia you cannot separate this from the word it's in the word if you separate it from the word you're teaching something other than William Branham taught or Paul taught or Jesus himself taught a man he where he is the miraculous is always present in this generation under the third pole it produced miracles come on somebody it produced miracles amen as we said they don't say that the miracles were past they say the day has passed it's at another time it's in the future time that's the devil always at work he can't talk us out of what God can do but he'll tell us it's not for our day well he did that 40 years ago and he's not doing it no more that's hogwash hey man this is the book has been open to the believer so you could believe in the supernatural it's going to take a supernatural belief that this body it's going to take a body change then if I can believe for a body change I can believe for my body to be healed delivered set free whatever God has for me I going to believe for it the third pull nothing but miraculous dead fish did you notice dead fish laying in the water it didn't go through a healing process days and months of recovery it did what the leopard did the leopard didn't have to go through skin therapy and every kind of thing and recovery amen the blind men didn't have to go through this thing when he met Jesus it all changed in a moment right there and this is what the third pole was bringing back to us a resurrected Christ among us with the same power who cares about everything and the smallest of details to where he would unleash his power on a little bitty fish it seems so in a unimportant alright little fish you shot your last wad and throws it over there in the water but the angel of God has his eye on the little fish and he opened up the word aiming the power of God flew through there and that little fish all of a sudden I give you back your life in Jesus name he didn't go through a whole rich or whole thing of a rehabilitation and all that no it was miraculous it changed it went right back to his life again in a moment in a twinkling of an eye well hallelujah he meant squirrels they didn't go through the birthing process they didn't go through the growing process they was automatically made out of nothing into a complete whole living creatures fully grown and ready for harvest miraculous storm amen a storm brewing upon the earth amen was causing problems in situation and a word spoken said you go back to where you came from and it vanished too what people had to testify down there to store we were supposed to get this and we don't know what happened it's gone hallelujah a tumor he wasn't going through it processing and going through a chemo treatment and this and that in the other it was showing I am the Lord that healeth thee too many times we refer we record we're relying upon the man anointing and I thank God for the man anointing but don't forget it what an anointing we're under we are under the eagle anointing and under the eagle in order amen you don't have to swim across that River he'll take you across that River this is the time this is the moment a menace spoke out of existence had these boys Amen just in a moment late right over and gave their heart to God but Satan tries to keep us looking at a day gone or a future time to come well one day this is the day and when you realize this is your time that's the month that's the point when you realize this is my day the devil ain't got enough to stop it just as we was going through this I posted there on our Facebook communication thing for a church the Lord just so deeply put something in me because we had knelt down me and my wife and praying about this situation and now you know I used these words many times in prayer lines and things and what we bind on earth will be bound in heaven what we loose on earth will be loosed in heaven and something just spoke to me as I prayed about it said go back and look at it again went back and beginning to read and it actually that power was released by a question and an answer given who do men say that I am well the your God who moved in the 60 years ago or your God who moved yesterday or you know you're a God of tomorrow and that's what they were saying they some say that you're of Eliza's bias of yesterday sure we can believe in lies yesterday he he'd done miracles he he done produced signs and wonders but and we can see that book not what about today and then begin they begin to go through all kind of things in the mind and finally the question comes in okay that's what they say but what do you say you have an opportunity to reply who do you say that I am and I'm asking even a light time and I call this morning who do you say that he is well it was brother and brother branham's day he done all this but you know instances say something and trying to go through all kind of explanation well who do you say something welled up in Peter and he said I say you are the Christ the Son of the Living God what was he doing he was bringing Christ present he was recognizing this is the day this is the moment amen he can only God can know who I was and call me by name and pull me out of the situation I was in you have to be the Christ oh my if you can look and say only God could call me by name and pull me to this place and bring me here he is nothing but the Christ and he said flesh and blood hadn't revealed to this you didn't learn this from your mama and your daddy but my father in heaven he's giving it to you and upon this revelation what revelation of who Jesus is now present right now the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it cut they're looking at that the gates of hell represents all that hell is so whatever's in Hell spirits of demons of health torment sicknesses problems situation the gates of Hell cannot prevail against that revelation when you refer it realize he's here he's right now present Oh hallelujah if we could enter into that realm this morning that this is not just an ordinary Sunday morning this is not just an ordinary service but God is here present and this is my moment with the king it's my moment in his present I'm having my opportunity he's said it like this he said God told Moses now you go and I'll send an angel before you to keep the way and to bring you into the place that I have prepared beware of him obey his voice for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him that angel was they angel the Covenant which was Christ Jesus and many of them did not believe it many of them give been listening to it as me and my wife going through the Bible chapter by chapter and you here of all the miraculous things that God had done it and the supernatural works of how he delivered him out of Egypt I brought them through the Red Sea how he took them through the wilderness and they get to the promised land they said we can't do it and if we get murmuring and complaining and Margaret Africa many people did not believe it no matter what sign they saw and those who did not believe it perish but those who believed how many believers we got here this morning those that believed went into the promised land he said the man who reject light goes straight to total darkness and I believe to those today listen to this those that reject the Holy Spirit in the light of God who reject the day of miracles and so forth they will go into total darkness he said well if the hour will really come if our would come from my visitation I say God make me aware of my moment I think about it wonder what would what would be that what would we be saying I only want to really go down this road but just thoughts what would be saying if sister Atlanta and mr. missed her moment what have we said about people who did miss their moment it was a woman we will go through several of them in the Bible but the point of it is as we go through they recognize this is my moment today is the day not another service not another time not tomorrow not next week today they heard a little noise boat had just landed in the hour had finally arrived here come this little woman trying to get through to him what was it the hour was there her opportunity was there and here she comes trying to press through the crowd and then whoa people saying get back they'll pull you out of the temple she press right OH some of them said the days of miracles has passed that didn't stop her she press ride home the hour had come for her touch hallelujah the hour had come for her to touch that was all she goes right between their feet right between their legs whatever she had to do until she got her heart's desire and she touched the border of his garment and immediately and immediately the blood issue stopped Wow the hour had come and this is the hour Martha said if God was in his prophet surely God's in his son in a way she went to meet him he's at our brother hallelujah he said I'm not just excited I know right where I am now oh where are you at right now is your focus on the death of Lazarus and and the problems in the situation's and the critics and the cried or is your focus on the master has come and calleth for thee who MA is that she went to meet him going right through all the critics and those who pushed oh and saying days of miracles were past he said what happens when God speaks although it lingers it will come to pass he's I believe that God was going to do it there was everything but there was that great modernistic day of scientists and every kind of intellectual thing standing there saying days of miracles are passed here talk about the valley of ditches his speak about them needing water spoke about a prophet being in the being angry and so bring me a minstrel and begin to play a song the Spirit of God came on him and he beginning to recognize the day he was in he said go out there and dig ditches and the deeper you dig the more water you'll get every time they would dig maybe they'd stick a shovel down every service and he hit an old tin can he said just throw it out he said that guy that says the days of miracles are past kick him out of here so if you happen to be here it's your time to go can't came out of here dig old past that dig on a little deeper down there get down then you hit another one say well just a bunch of psychology a bunch of emotional work Oh a bunch of you telling me it's emotional work up at a motional work up I'm feeling right now no sir it ain't got nothing to do with my emotions what it has to do with what I saw I saw a woman that was laying down most at a point of death went into a cave no one has ever come out of brotherbrother wrong I see this happening but I see God moving in the miraculous rounds listen we got a word reason to be happy this morning we got a reason to be joyful and shouting the glory of Almighty God because we've seen him in our midst touching our hearts changing our lives even you're talking about emotion I got a lot this morning cuz I see my two boys fail with the Holy hallelujah if it do it from my house he'll do it for your house we are in the days of the baptism and the Holy Ghost that'll come upon a heart and change our life forever [Applause] that's Wednesday night we go home let me tell you the angel of God followed his home as we pulling into the driver driveway my little daughter Katie said Oh God so moved in my heart talking to her to tell him at the baptism the Holy Ghost I've reached so I said come here Katie I laid hands on her and begin to pray asking God to just come and reveal himself in a miraculous way to her we walk in the door I gather my family together and we begin to pray and the Spirit of God fell down on the place not even knowing why we've been out at the lake house her Adrianna and her mom at home speaking about things and what they've been going through and the difficulties and praying about and asking God to move I felt it upon my heart I laid my hand upon Adrianna and I said you demon of Hell and trying to come put complexes on my daughter trying to tell her she's not worried that I resist you in the name of Jesus Christ she went down to her knees and begin to begin to just weep and cry and the angels of God began to move among us I grabbed ahold of her and I said you went down one way but you're coming up another hallelujah Lazarus went down a dead man but he came up alive hallelujah amen you might be feeling like you're going down but this morning the Word of God said you might be down but you're coming up enough hallelujah you might have went down to prayers he might have went down with anxiety he might have went down with fear but you're coming up victorious over ever devil in hell blessed be the name of the Lord [Applause] well hallelujah [Applause] before all this went down my dad spoke of a dream he had he said I don't know what to make out of it he said I don't know what's about to happen he said maybe it had to do with brother Ron I don't know he said with the I was on a piece of equipment and I was straightening out a road and I was straightening it out and I was making it straight I don't know if you've heard what's been going on the last services been a road being straightened out all these little side things people get on and they fall off the Sun bringing it bright back to what the prophet of God talked to what Paul talked come on somebody he said a man pulled up when I was on that piece of equipment stood at me just point blank pointed a gun and shot he said but he missed he said this shot was so loud it woke me up and I come to hear in that shot on Thursday night as I called

the eyeball to eyeball say Satan you miss you try to destroy my family you try to bring 9 meters on me you try to bring high blood pressure you try to bring all these say from the gates of hell you missed this is the day of miracles this is a day that the I am is among his people [Applause] he said what you need to do is you lay that only thing aside the days of Americans are passed and you kick it away and you keep digging lay aside the saying I make it heal tomorrow night I make it heal tomorrow afternoon lay aside that and say I'm going to be healed right now this is my time I'm gonna dig a ditch here and when the Holy Spirit falls he's gonna feel it up and I'm gonna jump up and start running with the joy of Almighty God and the praises of car I am killed oh [Applause] mercy but to preach out of my blows is more I preached out of my shoes one time mercy Wednesday night little boy young man knelt right over there and gave his heart to the Lord and brother let me approach being

just got a brain bleeding do it for my mom being do it for you [Applause] somebody was just saying this to yesterday I can't remember who it was a lot of things maybe was yesterday maybe was a day before yesterday whatever day said you know I've used I've used this many times about the Lord God that heals all our diseases and he used the word all three letters so that everything the devil could ever come up with fits in that all he didn't have to list it all out or have some kind of fine print and said well except this except this and said no oh but somebody told me yesterday I never thought about it brother Joe said the reason he put it in there now he has to stand behind it that somebody's going to be healed of every disease name it it's in there he talks about another place about that going in that barn over you know the story young trees were coming up under those old bird up limbs and trees have been there saying days of miracles or pass such fanaticism he said he said I've watched though as the wind began to blow he said when that begin to blow he said have put me in the mind of a good old fashioned God sent Holy Ghost revival you know getting reports of people you know that saying well I need services right now seven days a week now what you need is Jesus get to Jesus quit making excuses for the sin you're living in if you could make an excuse for the senior living in ain't no God okay if you had services ten times a day you're not going to get out of it until you come face-to-face with Jesus say Lord I was wrong forgive me and you lay it at his feet then if services don't happen for six months when you get to the end of that six months you'll still be serving Jesus you'll still be loving Jesus you'll still be glorifying Jesus hallelujah amen in church say Amen church is a wonderful thing and I believe as a Christian we ought to go to church but Church ain't what saves us people got in their mind well I got to get in church to be say no you need to get into Jesus to be saved then you're getting the Jesus you'll come to church you'll do the things that Christian ought to do but if you get to him all these other things will be taken care of people say well I need G I need church to fix my temper no you need Jesus to fix your temper well I need church to fix my pornographer a problem no you need Jesus to fix that help services and and rehabs is not going to fix it you'll come out of rehab you might do good for a couple look at old drunk they'll go through rehab out to rehab Africa never fixes it but if you come to Jesus said these signs he said that Holy Ghost revival he said when signs and wonders begin to come into a church so apparently he believed in signs and wonders in a church these big old churches moan and say I don't believe in them things that's fanaticism the days of miracles are past and the wind wrestling whistling right on down and the same one that makes them moan makes us rejoice same wind [Music] is that when you shook up that tree every time it shakes and it begins to go and get a deeper hole in the better hole he said that's what we need today is a good old time holy ghost shaking getting down glory to God get a hold of God all the shaking and pulling pulling the Holy Ghost does - he's loosening up that old dirt and he's digging you down to get a better hoe be rooted and grounded in Christ Jesus them experiences the experiences of healing the experiences of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the experience of the gifts of the Spirit which are miracles signs and wonders tongues just anchors you deeper in Christ he said let the church squeak and moan all she wants to let her say the days of miracles is past if they want to believe that they might as well their dad anyhow oh that offends me well you're offended with the prophet of God you offended with what the Lord's would speak in his generation oh they say we're a church we're Church he said so was them trees trees hello but look at them no bark on them oh you see the fire of Hell burning through the church takes woman's clothes off and got no bark on them you see it moving right in spirits of hell listen you see the political thing that we're living in right now moving right into the church people taking sides of this and that and the other and and you got you know I got on this side of masks and I'm on this side of no mask and I'm on this side of of this and I'm on that side of the well I'm on the side of Jesus and people in this message is wanting the Church of God to stand up and agree with this political movement that's taking place right now you need to read what that political movement is if you'll read an deep enough you'll find out it's the people knocking on the doors of lot Breeden it's their agents in their writings read it it's their it's the people I mean the people of Sodom the sodomites knocking on the door of lot saying send those angels out what does that mean to me it means fire is about to fall but what does that mean to me lot was over here but over here was angel Abraham and Sarah having a visitation of an angel the miraculous was taking place no matter how much lunch said it wasn't so Sodom out said it wouldn't so Abraham and Sarah says I know it so I met him and he deserted my heart and he told me who I was and I feel a change in the wind I want to tell you even like tabernacle I feel a change in the wind Amen this wind is blowing through our hearts and lives and God's won't need to do something put your wings out thank God I'm moving in the supernatural round I'm moving in all things are possible I'm believing for the impossible [Applause] Abraham and Sarah believed in it they want to squawk they want to squeaks AOA live but God sent his wind just the same bartemaeus come to his time in his moment heard a noise God had provided a lamb for bartimaeus eyes he said what's all this noise but you see brother man said this he said usually where he's at there's noise they said it's Jesus of Nazareth passing by he threw off his coat he didn't even look worried when he didn't care there was a lamb coming through some of them were screaming days of miracles are passes no such a thing as this day and he began to cry out louder than he ever lie ever cried thou son of David have mercy on me how much you owe me God had provided the lamb and he says you church if God said you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost then go get it if God says healing is for the church then go get it if God says the days of miracles are here then go receive it if God's Word is what we're talking about it's not anybody else's word it's his word Goliath made a challenge well the Branham said he'd come out and made one big haha it was his last ha ha ha ha it was his turn to go down in the pit huh think about that morning as he got up Goliath got up and he they made him breakfast and he ate his breakfast that was his last breakfast he got up and he put his armor home that was his last time to put his armor on he got up and he put his sword in his check in his scabbard he grabbed his head told his shield bear to come on amen it was the last time they was going to walk down that hill and he let out of his mouth and he began to speak it was the last time he was about to speak oh my god amen as I said the last days perilous times shall come amen last days for her last days for Goliath last days for cancer last days for sugar diabetes high blood pressure spirits of depression and anxiety and paying spirits of Hell is tormented your family for generation after generation they are about to have their last day hallelujah cancer is about to have his last person to live in [Applause] he come out and he gave his last hahahaha he said it one day to many because in that day brother Brandon was sitting in another place he said there was a different set of ears in the camp and nimr ears have been tuned to the supernatural rounds it had been in tune with the angels of God coming and delivering his people and delivering the line of the the Lamb of the lion out of the bear it had been tuned to another realm it had been looking at another round David knew his his little rock knit and do nothing to that line as far as it is humanly speaking he couldn't do nothing I wonder how many lately he's killed a lion with a slingshot no I ain't goal of the slingshot a bear with a slingshot he knew humanly speaking it was not him he just let the rock go and God did the rest so if he knew God could do the rest on a lion or a bear this wasn't nothing to God because this was an uncircumcised daredevil standing in his promised land that God had given God's people hallelujah and David looked around and what his words what who is that guy who is that oh it's Goliath he's he's stomping around giving his challenge he'd been here for forty days he said you mean to tell me you're letting that uncircumcised Philistine standing there and defy the armies of the Living God now David it was a lot of fighting David he knew what God had promised he said you mean to tell me you let the uncircumcised philistine tell you that days of miracles are past so now we know who's saying that for listings all that our amongest are not of us hello somebody the listings saying days of miracles are past but when Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] he said you mean to tell me you let him tell you that the baptism the Holy Ghost Saint is real today as it was on the day of Pentecost when it's to your children to you that so far off he said you shall receive the power after this Holy Ghost comes upon you the power he said what the need today is is some Holy Ghost spunk that's had enough for what the devil is saying and going to speak the Word of God and let that stone of faith loose and let God back it up and here it is I mentioned earlier I heard a fella say the other day that sickness is the Lord brought sicknesses and put sickness on you might be that you're sinning you've done something wrong make it right with God he said that's okay but he said the sickness is of the devil sicknesses is an attribute of sin because of sin we have sickness not because you sin but something down through generations may be visited down from the third and fourth generation but the blood of Jesus Christ takes away every sin and it takes away every sicknesses if you are a David and ready to stand in your place [Music] we don't need theological vest think done is no good for 60 years we need faith in a word of God and somebody willing to let it go this is what he would say you speak to the mountain wasn't go figure out all the quotes and figure out all the scriptures and figure out everything get it all lined up perfectly you speak and it'll happen we're living under the third pole we're living under the open word it opened up everything heaven has it opened up all of heavens blessings it opened up everything that God has given in this moment has been unloosed on us listen we say of people that are being loosed spirits of every kind of hell out of hell two hundred thousand thousand demons have been reduced from from the river Euphrates and they are falling upon people and they're taking them under their control and speaking things that makes no sense even humanly speaking they're saying things that makes no sense humanly speaking because it's not a human it's a devil but if we also see that world being poured out upon the people we also should be able to see another world a heavenly world being poured out upon the people there in that place it's time for us to be in our place and begin to live the Word of God not read it not try to understand it but make it live let it live give it room in our hearts you know I'm just gonna go personal here pour do me read this he said a man who's just got theology he'll say I believe that days of miracles are past and you'll push it off on some kind of big gutter pipe to run it off his field he don't want it on his field he doesn't want it he says what a pity I've gotten all kind of quotes of the storm and things you know the stories we've got people chattering around like a little chipmunk laughing that is being blowed out down in the storm what I thought God healed I thought God delivered I thought God didn't is I thought God healed the brain bleed I thought God healed cancer I thought bla bla bla bla ha ha ha Goliath you're about to have your last ha ha because there's a people anointed by an eagle anointing they may have been blowed down in the storm and the storms of life had caught him unaware and they come down and they was just there and for a moment but brother Adam said as I looked at that eco I noticed he wasn't even looking at me he wasn't not paying no attention to the chipmunk chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter he could care less what the chick monk had to say because he was not an earthbound creature oh [Applause] come on heavenly bound people if you're heavily bound you're not earthbound and you're not worried about what earthbound people say because he just give us a moment we're just feeling the wind the wind is coming into our wings again things are beginning to happen signs and wonders are among the people God's moving in miraculous ways and it won't be long that winds gonna blow and blow to such a point it's gonna lift us out of here to go be with him in the heavenlies [Applause] [Music] I'm done listening to chatter chatter I'm listening to all things are possible I'm listening to God does impossible man I'm listening to okay I'll see you in the morning I'm listening to Shalom I'm listening to God's peace be upon you in the middle of struggles in the middle trial in the middle of the most evil age they ever been pitched alone you know when my son Andrew was born God did something very personal to me and you can tell I'm thumbing through a lot of stuff God spoke to me in a way I'll never forget Andrew was a little newborn baby struggling for his breath and the men in the hospital I remember walking in there as a doctor the pediatrician come in they took his oxygen off for just a minute and watched him turn just his blue and purple as he could be and she thought that oxygen bond there to get him out of here he's not going to die on my watch said we don't have the possibilities to treat him he's got to go to another place so here I am my wife and one hospital suffering with a c-section my son being transported to another hospital and I get in a car go to Walmart to pick up a few things there in Minden for my wife and gonna go move on to go see Andrew in the next hospital in Shreveport Shumpert turn the radio on and heard these words as a man began to speak abraham believed in God it anchored so deep into me because I'd been fighting you know as we've just read you know the thoughts come well you're going through this because you've done something or you had you know you've done something against God that's why he's punishing you know the devil sitting there - eating your lunch but I got to thinking Abraham in one side in the Old Testament lied done things wrong made mistakes read all about it it's roping there but there was a change of dispensations to our Abraham wasn't no wonder no longer under just the blood of bulls and goats he was under the blood of the Lamb and not one fault of Abraham was mentioned in this New Testament but matter of fact it says Abraham was strong in the faith and he staggered not at the promise of God and I looked and I said god I'm a son of Abraham and your blood is still applies to me and I'm not under the blood of bulls and goats I'm under the blood of Jesus Christ and the Lord spoke to me very plainly said you go in that hospital room you don't look at monitors you don't look at hoses you don't look at the baby you look at the promise and God came on the scene and moved on his behalf come out of the hospital it was out of a couple a couple of weeks went right back in the hospital with some kind of viral infection in his lungs and the doctors we got out of that doctor said well he's just gonna have loan problems his whole life here's these breathing treatments he's going to receive them for we don't know how long we just have to judge it just take start giving him these breathing treatments we started giving them breathing treatments one day my wife was giving him one she said hold up just a minute God healed his lungs why are we accepting this she takes him up for prayer at the moment she felt led to Amen on a Sunday and God came down and touched him the next day she said I'm not giving him a breathing treatment got worse and worse and worse and she said just a few days I got to look that god help me not look at this practice but look at your promise and that Monday was one of the worst days of Andrews breathing but the next day better the next day better the next day better went back to the doctor and the doctor said them breathing treatments are doing a lot of good keep him up she said I ain't gave him no more he's been healed hallelujah and he's still healed today yesterday as I was studying on this on the day of miracles and going through quote after quote after quote for the Sam patent had offered to cook as a brisket for our family we enjoyed that very much brother Sam thank you so we could have a time together yesterday and we had a wonderful time with dad there and just talking about the things of God and the miracles that we're seeing so I went to meet him as he was growing up to be with his family there the Mitchells I went to meet him to get this brisket and as I got in the truck I was thinking on the days of miracles and I don't there's music stations and I don't normally listen to him I just don't I usually listen to our podcasts and and and so but I just hit the radio station it came up to the station there comes out of Homer and Shreveport it says but anyway it was a song being played and I got to listening to the words says mountains are being moved strongholds are being loosed God we believe it yes we can see it wonders are
