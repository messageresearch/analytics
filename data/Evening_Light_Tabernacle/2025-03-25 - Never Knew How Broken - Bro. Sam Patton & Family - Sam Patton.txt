========================================

[Music] I came [Music] scarred. I came in pieces. might have looked strong, but I really came in weakness. I came beat down at the end of my rope and without hope I came. I never knew how broken. I never knew how deeply scarred. I never knew the layers that covered up my heart. I never knew how empty. No, I never knew how lost. Until I came to [Music] Jesus, I never knew how broken. Down and out. Nowhere to [Music] turn, wandering aimlessly with no lesson learned. At the bottom, I surrendered everything that I was to him. I never knew how broken. I never knew how deeply [Music] scarred. I never knew the layers that covered up my heart. I never knew how empty. No, I never knew how lost till I came to Jesus. Never knew how broken a rejected king round in thorns. Israel showed through from the stripes [Music] he can be. On that ruged cross he died for all the lost. I never knew how [Music] broken. I never knew how deeply scar. I never knew the layers that covered up my heart. I never knew how indeed. No, I never knew how lost until I came to Jesus. Never knew how [Music] broken. I never knew how empty. No, I never knew [Music] how until I came to Jesus. I never knew how broken until I came to Jesus. I never knew how broken. [Applause]
