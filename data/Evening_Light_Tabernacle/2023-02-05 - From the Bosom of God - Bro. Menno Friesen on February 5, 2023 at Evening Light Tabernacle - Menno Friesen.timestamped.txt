[22:21] together as Believers and we're
[22:22] believing Lord even in this service that

[22:28] asking now we're calling on Your Name
[22:30] Lord we come Lord for one purpose that
[22:34] is to worship the most high God so we
[22:36] come this morning and doing that father
[22:38] we're inviting your presence Lord asking

[23:01] crying out for in our hearts we ask this
[23:03] this morning Lord in Jesus name we thank
[23:07] you for it and we give you praise Lord
[23:08] thank you Father
[23:13] it's good to be here with you I was out
[23:16] Wednesday traveling and just good to be
[23:18] back we had a wonderful service last
[23:22] weekend there were a few things that for
[23:25] the sake of time last weekend
[23:27] that we didn't make some announcements
[23:30] but there's a few things that the
[23:31] deacons have that I wanted to make
[23:34] mention of this morning and ask that you
[23:37] would just be mindful of them
[23:40] one of the things is I want to encourage
[23:43] everybody to get to church on time we've
[23:46] you know we've had
[23:50] um instances where you know there there
[23:52] are things Wednesday nights you know we
[23:55] have it at seven some people will work
[23:56] until you know five or six and they have
[23:59] to eat supper and then get here so we
[24:01] understand Wednesday nights are a push
[24:03] for some but Sundays you know it's it's
[24:07] a day that we set aside for worship and
[24:09] so we should make every effort to get
[24:12] here on time to give God honor so
[24:15] it'll allow you to get here prepare
[24:18] yourself for the service you can pray
[24:20] read your Bible we consider on time 30
[24:22] minutes before service not 11 o'clock so
[24:25] we're asking everybody to be mindful of
[24:28] that and just prayerfully uh come in and
[24:31] prepare yourself I believe you'll see
[24:33] the result in your life that God will
[24:34] honor that he'll honor your
[24:37] um you know that you would give honor to
[24:39] him so I believe it will please the Lord
[24:41] Jesus if we can do that so the other
[24:44] thing is our Nursery we have a lot of
[24:47] new uh moms dads and so just wanted to
[24:51] kind of go over some of the things there
[24:54] um it's not a play area you know as some
[24:57] people think well a nursery is the place
[24:59] to take your kids put them down let them
[25:00] run around get
[25:02] um you know but what it should be used
[25:04] for is take your baby there to be nursed
[25:08] diaper change get them settled down and
[25:10] then come back in to the service so
[25:12] we've got two we've got one that you she
[25:16] can take the children who are
[25:17] misbehaving maybe they're interrupting
[25:19] service you need to take them out so
[25:20] there's a nursery for that and then the
[25:22] other side the nursing mothers can go in
[25:25] and take care of their babies change
[25:26] diapers so
[25:28] neither of these are a place to visit we
[25:31] want we want you to go in there and it
[25:33] be a place where somebody's in there and
[25:35] they can steal we've got monitors the
[25:37] services going on so we want you to
[25:39] treat that like the sanctuary and keep
[25:42] that a place where worship can still
[25:45] occur not with the kids running around
[25:48] so we just ask you to do that and you
[25:52] know make that a place to take your
[25:54] children attend to their needs and then
[25:56] come back into the service so obviously
[25:59] you know you can stay in there and see
[26:01] the monitor but it's not like being here
[26:03] and it's kind of like streaming you know
[26:05] it's uh
[26:07] it's good but it's not like being here
[26:09] so we just want everybody to do that and
[26:12] just ask that y'all would would do that
[26:14] and God bless you this morning we're
[26:16] looking forward to a wonderful day of
[26:18] worship God bless you
[26:25] amen turn around tell your neighbor I'm
[26:27] happy to be here this morning Brothers

[51:07] uh it's uh it pays to start your car in
[51:11] the morning to get here
[51:13] it uh It's a Long Way South and uh but I
[51:17] did uh on the way down from Texas coming
[51:20] through here we did see some of our
[51:21] friends the snow geese and the Canada's
[51:24] were eating on the field so we kind of
[51:27] waved at them welcome so now we know why
[51:31] they always come this far south
[51:32] and uh part of uh part of Canada's here
[51:36] my word I seen there are they migrating
[51:39] this way for the winter I think they
[51:41] must be they must be it's good to see
[51:43] all of you and it's always nice to see
[51:45] the elect lady
[51:47] I uh I feel that way there's none like
[51:50] her uh I kind of feel that way about my
[51:52] wife and Irene by the way is her name if
[51:56] you didn't know and uh but uh we all
[51:59] feel that way and I'm glad he feels that
[52:01] way about us
[52:02] when I heard this last song it just
[52:06] blessed my heart to realize that we
[52:08] weren't running after him
[52:10] he came looking for us
[52:12] we didn't even know that we were in fact
[52:14] if we were honest most of us were
[52:16] running from the presence of the Lord
[52:19] but God rich in Mercy in fact it's
[52:21] that's the one message the first one I
[52:22] heard brother Brown speak in 1965
[52:24] running from the presence of the Lord
[52:27] when I was in Jeffersonville Indiana and
[52:30] when he preached the marriage divorce
[52:31] series I was blessed and privileged to
[52:34] be there for the series and uh the night
[52:37] when we walked into the Tabernacle the
[52:39] evenings Wednesday night
[52:41] and I heard brother Brown take his text
[52:44] running from the presence of the Lord
[52:46] and by that I'm already I had already
[52:49] quit running I had found the presence of
[52:52] the Lord and that's what I believe the
[52:54] species means to all of us we are
[52:56] honored and so blessed to know that that
[52:59] you can drive hundreds and thousands of
[53:01] miles and maybe find one here one there
[53:04] one there and there's the prophet sang
[53:05] that song so many times they come from
[53:08] the East and the West
[53:09] they come from the lands of Fire
[53:12] and there's here and there we'll think
[53:14] of how many churches we pass not because
[53:16] they're bad people they're wonderful
[53:18] people
[53:19] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[53:21] and blessed are your years for they hear
[53:24] and your hearts that can believe the
[53:26] very impossible of all times
[53:29] we're expecting the greatest event the
[53:32] greatest expectation lays in this
[53:34] closing seventh age that there's going
[53:37] to be little men and women walk off of
[53:39] the earth without dying
[53:41] it's only been heard a couple of times
[53:43] and done singularly Enoch had the
[53:46] privilege a few of them and uh but we
[53:49] all we know all those stories and
[53:51] they're so wonderful but now we are the
[53:52] last part of the Great puzzle of God and
[53:55] the last few pieces are put together I'm
[53:58] just so glad to be a part of that
[54:00] I'm just a part of you a part of the
[54:03] family of God
[54:07] give me that
[54:08] I'll try to sing this song you know how
[54:10] do you I'm more Infamous than famous
[54:14] I'm we're we've we did sing years ago
[54:19] and I say this humbly 19 and 70 and you
[54:22] know some of our good friends Brother
[54:24] Gary Brother Gary and Sister Barbara and
[54:27] Sandra sitting with them we uh they yo
[54:31] there's nothing like old friends
[54:33] and overestimated we're over 50 years
[54:36] ago when we met them first and uh
[54:39] brother Barney at that time and we
[54:41] preached in that area in the church and
[54:43] God called me to preach in 1970 and
[54:45] brother Tim and I have actually
[54:46] something very much in common
[54:49] we've both preached about 52-53 years
[54:52] now
[54:53] but he's a little younger than I am
[54:55] I started later I started when I was 28
[54:59] and God called me and it's been 50 to 53
[55:04] years and just this
[55:05] uh this December now my wife and I've
[55:09] always said you know when we ever if we
[55:10] ever retire now preachers don't retire
[55:12] they just slow down and I said if we
[55:16] ever get to the place to where we retire
[55:18] I'd like to take and when we go to
[55:20] Tucson and then go on down Phoenix
[55:22] Tucson and then go east as long as we
[55:25] feel I can at least to Louisiana
[55:27] and then maybe head upwards so that's
[55:29] what we're doing here we're just kind of
[55:31] driving feeling and doing and doing this
[55:35] which makes me I didn't really want to
[55:37] Preacher Brother Tim would have been
[55:38] preaching out of and felt way better
[55:40] but I but I would uh but I want to kind
[55:43] of uh put my liquefier with yours and uh

[1:02:46] they be just a little higher when they

[1:03:07] again today and I want to say this one
[1:03:09] more time that uh it's a it's a one time
[1:03:12] it might never happen again but I'm so
[1:03:14] glad to be here today and to get to meet
[1:03:16] you and and uh anytime when you I've
[1:03:19] always said this if you run out of who
[1:03:21] to pray for and I have my name crosses
[1:03:24] your mind pray for me
[1:03:26] I think it was so many times people have
[1:03:28] prayed for me I think how many times I
[1:03:31] prayed for others
[1:03:32] you ever notice how sometimes when
[1:03:34] you're just not thinking about anything
[1:03:35] you're just praying for somebody else
[1:03:37] and names start coming to your mind
[1:03:40] and names that I couldn't remember if
[1:03:42] somebody would ask me
[1:03:43] but the Lord begins to I like it when I
[1:03:46] get alone somewhere you know just away
[1:03:47] from everything driving my car names
[1:03:49] start coming I take advantage of that
[1:03:52] because they don't want to forget the
[1:03:53] names I can see their face to face now I
[1:03:56] know your face but the name
[1:03:59] but God bless you all and I love it I'm
[1:04:03] a little bit loud up here
[1:04:05] am I scaring you
[1:04:08] I'm going to try and be quieter
[1:04:10] but I I want to just share just a just a
[1:04:14] little bit before I uh I I don't know
[1:04:17] how long you have your services here but
[1:04:18] are you you're like brother you're like
[1:04:21] brother Harold they asked him one time
[1:04:23] about
[1:04:24] um Pastor said how long do you want me
[1:04:26] to speak oh he said I believe in the
[1:04:29] message of the hour
[1:04:34] so he was in the he was in the message
[1:04:37] so we'll do it somewhere within the hour
[1:04:41] no I I don't we know God's not a god of
[1:04:44] time we're people of time and uh I
[1:04:48] realize sometimes time is of a great
[1:04:49] Factor because
[1:04:52] um I remember one time my background was
[1:04:55] German and but really more Dutch than
[1:04:59] German we were in Germany and we came
[1:05:01] we'd taken a train my wife and I and
[1:05:04] everything's punctual in Germany
[1:05:07] they say exactly what they mean
[1:05:10] so we were we were coming into this one
[1:05:13] port and and uh the train was coming in
[1:05:16] and just outside of the city it stopped
[1:05:18] we thought well we're not there yet
[1:05:20] we're not and we looked at the time it
[1:05:22] is about two minutes too early
[1:05:25] exactly the time exactly when the when
[1:05:28] the clock we rolled in
[1:05:30] he stayed right outside I thought well
[1:05:32] now that's uh going a little far now
[1:05:34] that's close I mean uh but but you know
[1:05:39] we serve a god that is exactly the word
[1:05:43] he's not almost the word of God he does
[1:05:46] not almost mean what he says he means
[1:05:49] exactly what he says
[1:05:52] why wouldn't that be something where we
[1:05:54] could take him just that way exactly for
[1:05:56] what he said
[1:05:57] now I know we always and I'm not looking
[1:06:00] down on you I said oh I wish I could
[1:06:02] believe exactly just the way he said it
[1:06:05] because he's never had to change his
[1:06:07] word one bit of all of the ages and the
[1:06:11] science and the re the the minds of men
[1:06:13] have reached now disguised to where
[1:06:15] they're beyond almost Beyond human of
[1:06:17] what they're creating well they are
[1:06:19] because they're eating of the tree of
[1:06:21] the knowledge of Good and Evil but it's
[1:06:23] got death in it but God's word has no
[1:06:26] death in it except to the ones that
[1:06:28] reject the word then they're already
[1:06:30] dead
[1:06:31] Jesus talked about said they were
[1:06:33] already dead while they're living here
[1:06:34] in pleasure said they're already dead
[1:06:35] that's the reason how you can go by
[1:06:37] places and see things and churches and
[1:06:39] and religious orders and so on dead
[1:06:41] while they're living
[1:06:44] but life isn't measured by maybe say
[1:06:46] excitement or a noise but yet it's a
[1:06:49] part of it it's you know like I kind of
[1:06:52] like to say it the way the prophet said
[1:06:53] he said now let the stimulation come
[1:06:56] from the labor relation not the other
[1:06:58] way around get a revelation from the
[1:06:59] stimulation
[1:07:00] but I believe the simulation that comes
[1:07:02] from Revelation that stimulates us when
[1:07:05] the word of God is revealed to you
[1:07:07] personally then you know that you have
[1:07:09] passed from Death unto life that is
[1:07:10] God's way of doing things I like the way
[1:07:13] he operates don't you
[1:07:14] he's not you don't have to wait for me
[1:07:16] and I don't have to wait for you he
[1:07:18] reveals himself to whom he will and when
[1:07:20] he does no one can take it from you if
[1:07:23] God ever reveals to you like your pastor
[1:07:25] here I've heard him lots of times I've
[1:07:27] logged into this congregation but now
[1:07:29] see you face to face so it's good and
[1:07:31] I've heard the different Brothers
[1:07:32] brother Kelly uh he's up there uh right
[1:07:36] well he's in the church that I used to
[1:07:38] be in and it doesn't sound good does it
[1:07:42] I didn't leave him it was during the
[1:07:45] time when there was some storms passing
[1:07:47] through and uh but it almost you know
[1:07:49] almost blew all this what storms do
[1:07:51] sometimes it rolls all the chaff away
[1:07:52] and then it comes back to the reality
[1:07:54] again and the Brother Kelly's doing a
[1:07:56] wonderful job by the way brother Tim
[1:07:57] brother Dwayne Fair who is my son-in-law
[1:08:01] married Carney and he is now just he's
[1:08:05] become Pastor as of January the first so
[1:08:07] I'm now a free-floating uh radical you
[1:08:10] know what is so I'm I'm just taking my
[1:08:14] time and I don't have to get up I don't
[1:08:15] have I put all the burdens to him all
[1:08:17] the prayer requests and uh which is not
[1:08:20] that easy we always do pray but he said
[1:08:22] his greetings this morning brother
[1:08:23] Dwayne said his greetings and he said
[1:08:26] they went to hear brother Timothy who
[1:08:29] was at Brother Kelly's Church they went
[1:08:30] to hear him Friday night and said he to
[1:08:32] preached a tremendous message that's
[1:08:34] what he told us so we're glad I know
[1:08:37] they're happy over there and of course
[1:08:37] every year when brother uh Spencer and
[1:08:40] brother Tim come to Edmonton or to
[1:08:41] Brother Kelly's we uh we take in at
[1:08:44] least a couple meetings so so we always
[1:08:46] uh I know where he stands on the word of
[1:08:48] God
[1:08:49] blessed be the name of the Lord God and
[1:08:51] I'm so glad just let me just make a few
[1:08:53] comments here before I turn to the
[1:08:54] scripture and um I I usually don't
[1:08:57] preach too long but uh not that I run
[1:09:00] out of words to say uh you know how it
[1:09:02] is
[1:09:04] you know what the word of God is that
[1:09:06] way they're just when you start into
[1:09:07] something have you ever noticed as a
[1:09:09] Christian you know sometimes you just
[1:09:10] don't know exactly where you want to
[1:09:12] read so you open your Bible and you
[1:09:14] start reading and you know more two or
[1:09:16] three verses you say oh that's exactly
[1:09:18] what I needed that why that why why
[1:09:21] should I haven't read that before
[1:09:23] you have but we forget
[1:09:25] but it's the way of the spirit he knows
[1:09:28] you know he knows how to give you
[1:09:30] exactly what you need might be just one
[1:09:33] little part that doesn't connect with
[1:09:34] the other
[1:09:35] it could be this morning it could be
[1:09:37] maybe tonight or whenever the spirit of
[1:09:39] the Lord moves in strange ways but
[1:09:41] coming here to this Shreveport area I
[1:09:43] remember and I might not just say this
[1:09:45] is a joke or as a a bit of a tense part
[1:09:48] but Back in 1970 71 we were here with
[1:09:52] brother Perry Green in Shreveport and we
[1:09:55] came to the Tabernacle uh brother Jack
[1:09:58] Moore that brother how many knows
[1:10:01] brother Jack Murray well you know of him
[1:10:03] because brother Graham talks about
[1:10:04] constantly I think some of the greatest
[1:10:06] and uh you know towards the end brother
[1:10:08] Jack was always the kind that said
[1:10:10] brother Adam come preach what's up in
[1:10:11] your heart
[1:10:12] I don't know if he ever really saw the
[1:10:14] word completely but I know he said he
[1:10:17] enjoyed to have the Prophet come there
[1:10:19] because it was a powerful reality behind
[1:10:21] it but but let God do it we're not we're
[1:10:24] not judges we're Fruit inspectors so but
[1:10:26] I just let it go and God didn't call us
[1:10:30] a judge he said no the fruit's rotten
[1:10:32] said don't eat it so whatever it is but
[1:10:34] we're not judging but in the church
[1:10:37] Brother Moore come up that night and he
[1:10:39] was introducing us and brother green and
[1:10:40] and uh so he he had never met us before
[1:10:43] and we were we were nine of us there
[1:10:46] um you know all the musicians and and by
[1:10:48] the way the Believers were nine nine of
[1:10:50] us were first cousins from three
[1:10:52] families and uh the Doles freezing said
[1:10:55] freezing so we we we were singing
[1:10:57] together just like you do here in the
[1:10:59] church born Holy Spirit we had a great
[1:11:01] Revival and and uh 60s and into the 70s
[1:11:04] when the message began to come our way
[1:11:06] and uh of the one village where brother
[1:11:09] Kelly is still the pastor there of that
[1:11:11] local place where where God sent the
[1:11:13] Revival back in 1961 from actual 1957 to
[1:11:18] 19 uh 1665 when brother Graham died but
[1:11:22] in 1957 brother Ram came to came to
[1:11:24] Saskatoon and it was the first time I
[1:11:27] ever sat in his meetings I was 15 years
[1:11:29] old and like I said the other day when
[1:11:32] we were I I was 15 years old I was like
[1:11:34] most of you boys are 15 years old and
[1:11:37] you probably won't remember what I said
[1:11:38] but you remember the girl that was
[1:11:39] sitting over there
[1:11:41] and there now you know what I'm saying
[1:11:43] and I that's not what I was I didn't I
[1:11:46] don't know if I heard what brother
[1:11:47] Graham said but I was there so let me
[1:11:49] just put it that way I was there if you
[1:11:51] the only way I know what he said is I go
[1:11:53] listen to the tape
[1:11:54] but uh and but in 1965 when he preached
[1:11:59] the marriage divorce I was already
[1:12:00] married I had two children and uh and
[1:12:03] the holy I was filled with the Holy
[1:12:05] Ghost and it was one of the things that
[1:12:06] that was so precious to me when I heard
[1:12:08] Brothers speak those messages but when
[1:12:10] we were here and with the Believers we
[1:12:12] got introduced then Brother Moore uh
[1:12:15] Hebrews uh
[1:12:16] not reluctant but he but he kind of said
[1:12:19] well now these brothers will be singing
[1:12:21] today he said now they said now
[1:12:22] personally said I don't I don't know
[1:12:25] this is I heard it he said I don't
[1:12:27] really believe brother Ram was Malachi
[1:12:29] 4.
[1:12:31] and uh said I believe he's a man of God
[1:12:34] but I I do not and brother green was
[1:12:37] there he's going to tell all the
[1:12:38] testimony about how how the angel of the
[1:12:41] Lord met the prophet and what he did in
[1:12:42] decision and we were going to get up
[1:12:44] there and sing Seven Stars in the hands
[1:12:46] of Jesus the messenger that came William
[1:12:50] Branham was his name we're gonna sing
[1:12:52] all those songs and I thought oh my now
[1:12:54] he said he doesn't believe this message
[1:12:55] and he's the pastor here that didn't
[1:12:58] make us feel he didn't want to make us
[1:13:00] feel unwelcome he just that's just what
[1:13:02] he said at least he was honest you know
[1:13:04] and he said he didn't believe it and so
[1:13:07] then they introduced and I came and he
[1:13:08] said now you you introduced the brothers
[1:13:10] so I did and I said now we're going to
[1:13:13] have I hope we don't have a problem here
[1:13:14] today because I do believe
[1:13:16] that brother Ram was the angel of
[1:13:18] Malachi 4.
[1:13:20] but I said to you know to to stall the
[1:13:22] argument uh you know let's not fuss
[1:13:25] about something that's in the distance I
[1:13:26] said now if if we've seen something like
[1:13:29] look like a horse or might be a moose if
[1:13:30] you're in our country say no that's not
[1:13:32] a horse looks like it's a moose whether
[1:13:34] we can fuss all we want but I said why
[1:13:36] don't we just keep on walking
[1:13:38] and we keep on walking and when we get
[1:13:40] when it comes clear said I can look at
[1:13:42] you and you can look at me and say hi
[1:13:45] we don't have to say anything do we
[1:13:47] I don't have to say I was right and you
[1:13:49] were wrong I don't even say that
[1:13:52] just keep on walking
[1:13:54] and I say this to the local assembly and
[1:13:55] you're a good pastor here it's good to
[1:13:57] keep on walking what we don't see today
[1:14:00] just keep walking this is a continual
[1:14:03] unfolding light there are things that I
[1:14:05] I wouldn't go back to 20 years 30 years
[1:14:08] back I'm walking in this light this is
[1:14:11] this is light to me
[1:14:13] I'm not trying I'm not waiting for
[1:14:15] something new I'm walking in what is the
[1:14:18] the light of God it gives light wherever
[1:14:21] it shines so walk in the light and and
[1:14:24] God bless you I know that but as Hebrews
[1:14:27] says you know not laying again
[1:14:29] foundations of different things but
[1:14:31] let's go on to Perfection like like
[1:14:34] matured if we were talking about
[1:14:36] maturity we know what we're talking
[1:14:37] about this is the age of all maturities
[1:14:41] this is the age of the the Satan's Eden
[1:14:45] it's it's maturing he's he's got a real
[1:14:48] Eden here you watch the watch the things
[1:14:50] that he's doing
[1:14:52] yeah he's got him a kingdom that he's
[1:14:53] not wanting to give up
[1:14:55] he's he's planning on living here a long
[1:14:58] time
[1:15:00] but already notice has been served him
[1:15:01] already of eviction we know that thus
[1:15:05] saith the Lord that he will not be able
[1:15:07] to finish this Kingdom he won't be
[1:15:08] staying here long he might inhabit it
[1:15:10] for about a half hour an hour
[1:15:12] but that's all he's got
[1:15:14] and because there's there's a little
[1:15:16] honeymoon while that's going on and
[1:15:18] there's a bride coming back to live here
[1:15:19] for a thousand years
[1:15:22] by God's grace I want to keep on walking
[1:15:23] walk from that Dimension to this
[1:15:25] Dimension I believe that's why we're
[1:15:26] here this morning that's what everyone
[1:15:27] is desires that's why we preach that's
[1:15:30] why we talk that's why we encourage
[1:15:31] that's why we stand and try to say don't
[1:15:34] give up just and it's not you giving up
[1:15:35] anyhow I kind of like one Satan and
[1:15:37] brother Brown makes I kind of you know
[1:15:39] we all have favorite
[1:15:41] brother Brian said at one time and and
[1:15:44] remember I'm not quoted exactly but
[1:15:45] someone said oh I'm trying to hold on
[1:15:47] I'm trying to hold is that hold on
[1:15:48] nothing
[1:15:49] he said he's holding on to me
[1:15:52] and you're saying that I kind of like
[1:15:53] that song you know we you try to say oh
[1:15:55] I want to hold on to the Lord look
[1:15:57] you've already made it if you're in
[1:16:00] Christ you're already with him seated
[1:16:01] with him in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:16:03] Jesus now and now are you the sons of
[1:16:05] God now you're the daughters of God you
[1:16:07] might not even be filled with the Holy
[1:16:08] Ghost but if it's the seed of God in you
[1:16:10] it'll quickly you'll keep leading you to
[1:16:12] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:16:14] the Holy Ghost fill you and keep on
[1:16:16] right on moving come on right on walking
[1:16:20] just like you say whoa I wish I was you
[1:16:22] know when you're when you're 15 you want
[1:16:24] to be 18. when you're 18 you want to be
[1:16:26] 20 21 when you're 21 you want to be 18
[1:16:29] again no I mean but you know it doesn't
[1:16:32] take very long you get past the places
[1:16:33] oh would it be nice to be 25 again
[1:16:37] yeah yeah
[1:16:39] with that I think oh I'm so glad he took
[1:16:41] a picture of us when we were 20 21 like
[1:16:43] that
[1:16:44] some of us got some real good friends
[1:16:45] across the other side you know I'm
[1:16:47] almost saying this respectfully and I do
[1:16:50] say there's almost more people on the
[1:16:51] other side already that is on this side
[1:16:53] I've seen a whole generation of
[1:16:56] Believers that believe this message pass
[1:16:59] away and whole age I think in our church
[1:17:02] there's probably one my aunt is living
[1:17:04] she's 93 I believe right now she's still
[1:17:07] living
[1:17:09] and that's the only one that I remember
[1:17:11] of the village there were Brother
[1:17:12] Kelly's the pastor of the church that
[1:17:14] still is of the stock that was first
[1:17:16] born into the messages and lives today
[1:17:18] now the rest are all new converts and
[1:17:21] we're so glad I wish I'm glad Jesus
[1:17:23] didn't come when when the prophet when
[1:17:25] he took the prophet
[1:17:26] now we we was there so we're really
[1:17:29] hoping that that would be the end of it
[1:17:31] we we believed it would be
[1:17:33] yeah uh I I just might as well confess
[1:17:34] it I said I was one of them there and I
[1:17:36] believe with all my heart that that
[1:17:38] there's going to be a Rapture right then
[1:17:39] and uh but it didn't come then
[1:17:42] foreign
[1:17:43] but it's on its way
[1:17:46] we live and we breathe with everything
[1:17:48] that we do and I'm trusting even here
[1:17:50] that you understand it's not trying to
[1:17:51] put a scare on people I do not believe
[1:17:53] that Christian is going to be scared
[1:17:56] uh you know because
[1:17:58] we were just simply experiencing the
[1:18:01] reality of the entire scripture because
[1:18:03] this is a book of life that was written
[1:18:05] by God himself but penned by men but God
[1:18:08] wrote it himself in every line and every
[1:18:10] verse speaks of him the the One Singular
[1:18:14] part
[1:18:15] of the whole book is that our Lord is
[1:18:18] one Lord but but he has many attributes
[1:18:21] and we've seen him unfolding unfolding
[1:18:23] as we're seeing at you but but even
[1:18:24] taking the messages like the prophet
[1:18:26] said about watch the two Vines how
[1:18:27] they've come together till now but the
[1:18:29] two Vines have been growing been growing
[1:18:31] the the fruit is there and now we're
[1:18:34] seeing the maturity of both of them
[1:18:37] not just one not just Satan's Eden I've
[1:18:40] given I've given Satan a little Glory
[1:18:42] there
[1:18:43] but he is Satan can only operate where
[1:18:45] God allows them to our praise
[1:18:48] he is not above God he has no no
[1:18:51] authority over God God still holds him
[1:18:53] exactly remember the scripture Isaiah 45
[1:18:55] is there evil is there Wicked and the
[1:18:57] Lord hath not done it all the things
[1:18:59] that are on the earth that give him gave
[1:19:01] him reason and power of being
[1:19:04] what if there was no sinner he'd not be
[1:19:06] a savior
[1:19:07] what if we weren't born in sin
[1:19:10] there would be no Redeemer but the great
[1:19:12] author he knew from the beginning he
[1:19:14] didn't say oh I choose this or not
[1:19:16] choose that one oh no he knew who was in
[1:19:18] him then
[1:19:19] and my little thought this morning if I
[1:19:21] would I'll just move on to that and I
[1:19:22] want to I it's just been lately it's
[1:19:24] been been uh kind of pounding on my
[1:19:27] heart and from the bosom of God I read a
[1:19:30] little partner brother Ram talks about
[1:19:31] you know the uh Dew Drop and uh he he
[1:19:35] takes a little time and goes through and
[1:19:36] said how the Dew Drop said said oh and
[1:19:38] said and it's born in the middle of the
[1:19:40] night in darkness
[1:19:42] now just consider yourself where were
[1:19:44] you when I born
[1:19:46] in darkness in sin come to this world
[1:19:48] speaking lies and just but just as soon
[1:19:51] as the Sun starts coming up we begin to
[1:19:53] shiver we begin to take a different
[1:19:54] attitude or something we wanted to get
[1:19:56] back to where we were from
[1:19:58] what's the desire of you here this
[1:20:00] morning you get back where you came from
[1:20:01] where you really came from which I'm the
[1:20:04] son of son so I'm the son I yeah we have
[1:20:06] natural parents but if you're a Son of
[1:20:08] God and a daughter of God you are the
[1:20:11] Eternal attribute of God loosed upon
[1:20:13] this age
[1:20:14] delivered upon the stage to Bear out and
[1:20:16] and bear out the works of God the seed
[1:20:19] of God for you are the living epistle
[1:20:23] that's been written by God
[1:20:26] and now made manifest you didn't live in
[1:20:28] Luther's age I didn't live in wesleys
[1:20:30] they joined Pentecostals I didn't even
[1:20:31] live in Pentecostal age
[1:20:34] I came in under the message of this age
[1:20:38] when I came to the Lord it was in the
[1:20:41] message and I remember my parents they
[1:20:43] were they were they come out of
[1:20:44] Mennonites and then went into
[1:20:46] Pentecostalism then into latter rain but
[1:20:49] while in later rained they were
[1:20:50] beginning to they were thirsting for God
[1:20:52] and in 1957 when brother Ram came
[1:20:55] through Saskatoon it was a time of
[1:20:57] confusion in our area and uh but from
[1:21:01] that time I'd say this humbly from that
[1:21:03] time my dad was determined he took the
[1:21:06] tapes
[1:21:07] and order the tapes whatever he could in
[1:21:09] the books that they were available and
[1:21:11] in our home the influence of this
[1:21:13] message started in the July of 1957. my
[1:21:18] dad took the books home and began to
[1:21:20] read them and I remember you know
[1:21:22] Prophet visits South Africa a man sent
[1:21:26] from God and there was a couple of Judah
[1:21:28] status books that we got along the way
[1:21:30] but as he started reading them and uh my
[1:21:33] dad is still read German Luther's Bible
[1:21:36] and uh so when he when he'd read the
[1:21:39] Bible he still read but he started
[1:21:41] reading English because he's starting to
[1:21:43] read Brothers books
[1:21:45] so he's kind of learned English he only
[1:21:47] had a third grade of English so he
[1:21:49] started reading and as he started
[1:21:52] reading I still remember just being a
[1:21:53] young boy sitting at the table he he'd
[1:21:55] stop once in a while and said my he said
[1:21:58] this reads just like the Bible
[1:22:01] said this accident looks just like the
[1:22:03] Bible
[1:22:04] like the prophets of old
[1:22:06] we didn't even know he was a prophet at
[1:22:08] the time
[1:22:09] but it was it said just and he said well
[1:22:11] I think he kind of felt like that
[1:22:13] sometimes people say oh you're off the
[1:22:14] word oh it's not right it can't be that
[1:22:16] he said well I'll just stay with this
[1:22:18] till that comes then yeah so we just
[1:22:20] stayed with it and come to find out one
[1:22:22] day the Lord began to open up say oh
[1:22:24] truly this was that Elijah that was to
[1:22:27] come
[1:22:27] and I thank the Lord and we like men
[1:22:30] like that so sometimes maybe it's huge
[1:22:33] just stay with it if you've got a little
[1:22:34] light walk in that light
[1:22:37] don't be envious of somebody else's life
[1:22:38] there's plenty for you
[1:22:40] there's plenty pleasure I like this the
[1:22:42] song room room yes there's room there's
[1:22:44] room at the fountain for me
[1:22:46] I want to take a real read a scripture
[1:22:48] here I'm I'm already
[1:22:50] um
[1:22:51] I didn't finish what I wanted to say
[1:22:53] there but I want to I want to finish it
[1:22:54] now
[1:22:56] when brother Brown makes that little
[1:22:57] comment about the little message I think
[1:22:59] it's called my commission
[1:23:01] and uh
[1:23:04] he talks about
[1:23:06] he talks about the little uh you know
[1:23:08] the Dew Drop and he said then as the sun
[1:23:11] begins to shine said maybe it's hanging
[1:23:13] on the line or the clothesline he said
[1:23:15] but as the drop is formed and then it
[1:23:17] begins to shiver he says
[1:23:20] and it makes a statement said
[1:23:22] why is it shivering said it's longing to
[1:23:24] go back where it came from
[1:23:26] and uh I want to take and read up read
[1:23:29] that part maybe that quote you know how
[1:23:30] it is I think there's nothing like when
[1:23:32] the prophet quotes something uh it
[1:23:34] always feels good
[1:23:36] so you don't mind if I read that
[1:23:43] pardon me
[1:23:45] I'm not sure you I'm used to writing
[1:23:47] things down but
[1:23:58] but he talks and takes the thought there
[1:24:00] and I just finding a little a little uh
[1:24:03] I can't find it right here now but let
[1:24:05] me just try
[1:24:11] foreign
[1:24:15] yes sure it is let me just finish that
[1:24:17] well how he says it he said now
[1:24:21] he said it's it's there
[1:24:24] that's the same thing with with the new
[1:24:26] birth he talks a little bit about he
[1:24:27] said now it Sparkles and it longs to go
[1:24:29] back said it wants to go back to where
[1:24:30] it came from and uh said now that's the
[1:24:32] way it is with the new birth we go we
[1:24:34] never go back we go forward and when
[1:24:37] you're born again that's why I think
[1:24:38] today we have so many uh not so many
[1:24:41] rather genuine new births is because the
[1:24:44] seed maybe will sympathize with the word
[1:24:47] or person but they don't want to rot
[1:24:50] away from the old system that they were
[1:24:53] in they don't want to come out of it
[1:24:55] they want to stay in the old system and
[1:24:57] claim the new birth or the message of
[1:24:59] the age we found that under the Luther
[1:25:01] Wesley Pentecost and the others they
[1:25:03] tried to hold on to the old system and
[1:25:05] claim this
[1:25:06] but the old system age must die rot
[1:25:10] in order to bring forth New Life
[1:25:13] say to bring forth new life and I I
[1:25:16] think that is so beautiful he said now
[1:25:18] watch that little thing he said now when
[1:25:20] it's back there
[1:25:22] but just let the sun shine out one time
[1:25:24] did you notice
[1:25:26] and I say this just let the s-o-m shine
[1:25:28] on a real predestinated heart
[1:25:31] one time just let the sunshine did you
[1:25:34] notice a habit gets
[1:25:36] and I believe in being happy
[1:25:38] but that's not what I'm what that's not
[1:25:40] I'm not happy
[1:25:42] to get a revelation
[1:25:44] I'm happy because I got the revolution
[1:25:47] from God he said it's just Quivers
[1:25:49] listen scriptures why it knows it's the
[1:25:52] sunlight is going to draw it back to
[1:25:54] where it was from the beginning and so
[1:25:56] is every man and every woman that's born
[1:25:58] of the spirit of God there's something
[1:25:59] about it when light spreads over us
[1:26:03] that they're happy because they know
[1:26:05] they're going back to where they come
[1:26:06] from
[1:26:08] from the bosom of God
[1:26:11] not from a church not from a community
[1:26:13] not from a certain area a certain
[1:26:15] Society but from the bosom of God when
[1:26:19] Jesus is on Earth he constantly referred
[1:26:20] to it I come from God and I go back to
[1:26:22] God I and my father are one he and never
[1:26:25] said he never talked about anything he
[1:26:26] said the son could do nothing
[1:26:28] and we look at the sovereignty of God
[1:26:30] how can he walk into a church how can he
[1:26:32] walk into a building of 500 people and
[1:26:35] he'll want and walk away
[1:26:37] when he had power by get when he had all
[1:26:39] powers given to him on Earth in heaven
[1:26:41] but he said he did nothing now I said
[1:26:43] earlier I said what is it if we could
[1:26:44] just take what God said if God said go
[1:26:46] take one out of him there that one's
[1:26:48] just laying over there he's not really
[1:26:50] sick anybody always too slow go pick
[1:26:52] that one up and take him out
[1:26:55] it doesn't say anything about when you
[1:26:56] read the scripture where Jesus stopped
[1:26:57] and they looked at this one and looked
[1:26:59] at that one discernment he just took the
[1:27:00] one and walked out
[1:27:01] Sovereign Grace
[1:27:04] we sit here that way this morning
[1:27:07] Sovereign Grace it's God's grace that
[1:27:10] has brought us here
[1:27:12] it was us they were sitting there and we
[1:27:15] often tell this
[1:27:17] how many people were sitting beside you
[1:27:19] when the same word was preached
[1:27:22] but something struck in your heart and
[1:27:23] said that's for me
[1:27:25] that's for me in my house James
[1:27:28] if you have your Bibles James puts a
[1:27:30] little that I would like to draw from if
[1:27:33] I could
[1:27:40] and the second chapter of this is often
[1:27:43] just going to pick on a little an old
[1:27:45] familiar I'm sure your pastors the devil
[1:27:46] the brothers here preaching on this
[1:27:48] often and it's a good one he died he
[1:27:52] separates works
[1:27:53] and Grace
[1:27:55] and puts them all together
[1:27:58] Works does not discharge grace and grace
[1:28:00] does not discharge works
[1:28:03] and he puts them all together James the
[1:28:05] second chapter is so beautiful at that
[1:28:07] and the prophet is preaching on this and
[1:28:09] he and he reads the scripture of course
[1:28:10] and uh I'd like to read it with you if
[1:28:13] you would it's James the second chapter
[1:28:15] but let's start around the 14th verse
[1:28:17] and just get the the background of it so
[1:28:20] what does it profit my brethren though a
[1:28:22] man May
[1:28:24] have say he has faith that have not
[1:28:27] works can Faith save him they say oh
[1:28:30] wait a minute I thought we're saved by
[1:28:31] grace
[1:28:32] we are
[1:28:34] we are but watch how high he puts it
[1:28:37] together I was like the way he doesn't
[1:28:39] leave any questions
[1:28:41] what does the prophet do our brethren
[1:28:43] though a man say he has faith and have
[1:28:45] not worse can Faith save him if a
[1:28:47] brother or sister is naked now watch and
[1:28:50] destitute of daily food now that's just
[1:28:51] not natural that's spiritual
[1:28:53] and one of you say unto him depart in
[1:28:56] peace and be warned and filled
[1:28:58] notwithstanding you give them not those
[1:29:01] things which is needed to the body what
[1:29:05] does it profit
[1:29:07] even so faith
[1:29:09] if it hath not works is dead being alone
[1:29:13] yeah and a man say that thou has faith
[1:29:16] and I have Works show me thy faith
[1:29:17] without thy words and I'll show thee my
[1:29:20] faith by my horse
[1:29:22] thou Believers that there is one God
[1:29:24] that do as well
[1:29:27] the Devils also believe in tremble
[1:29:30] but it's a good thing to believe that
[1:29:31] there's only one God
[1:29:33] you can't get anywhere else beyond that
[1:29:36] if you if you if you have more than one
[1:29:37] God we're heathens
[1:29:40] now he's gotten many attributes and we
[1:29:42] won't go into that you've got a good
[1:29:43] you've got a teacher here so I won't
[1:29:45] even try that but that no vain man that
[1:29:48] faith without works is dead
[1:29:50] was not Abram Our Father justified by
[1:29:53] works when he was offered up Isaac his
[1:29:55] son unto upon the altar see us now then
[1:29:58] how Faith was wrought by works with his
[1:30:01] works and by works was made perfect
[1:30:05] and the scripture was fulfilled with
[1:30:07] saith Abraham believed God and it was
[1:30:10] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[1:30:13] he was called the friend of God so he ye
[1:30:18] see then how that by works a man is
[1:30:21] Justified and not by faith only life was
[1:30:25] also was not Rahab the heart of
[1:30:27] justified by works
[1:30:29] when she had received the Messengers
[1:30:33] and had sent them out another way
[1:30:36] look at the simple attribute
[1:30:39] that she had
[1:30:41] but where did she get it from
[1:30:44] it was revealed to her that these were
[1:30:45] men of God
[1:30:47] for as the body without the spirit is
[1:30:50] dead so faith without works is dead also
[1:30:54] let me just
[1:30:55] if you would bow just for a word of
[1:30:57] prayer I want to read a prayer for the
[1:30:58] church that brother Brown preached that
[1:31:00] he prayed
[1:31:02] when he preached the message of token I
[1:31:04] just blessed me so much a while ago when
[1:31:06] I read it and I want to read it to this
[1:31:07] Tabernacle because I will I would
[1:31:09] believe it's meant for you and for me
[1:31:12] brother van bow prayer and he says this
[1:31:15] Lord
[1:31:16] by your grace your help I claim everyone
[1:31:20] that's Heir that hears this message I
[1:31:23] claim them for you God I pray thee Lord
[1:31:25] both here and this message where it goes
[1:31:29] and those that hear it on tape
[1:31:31] and if there be a seed anywhere that's
[1:31:34] predestined Lord to hear the word of
[1:31:37] this last day may they come now sweetly
[1:31:40] and humbly and lay their trophies down
[1:31:43] at the cross or their selves as trophies
[1:31:47] of the grace of God that's called them
[1:31:50] and may they be filled with the Holy
[1:31:52] Ghost and display the token of the life
[1:31:55] of Jesus Christ in his resurrection as
[1:31:58] long as they remain here on Earth
[1:31:59] granted Lord these words Lord I may have
[1:32:03] not said them just right
[1:32:05] but if I didn't I pray that the holy
[1:32:07] spirit will take those words and present
[1:32:10] them
[1:32:11] the way that they should be presented
[1:32:14] that the people may understand and know
[1:32:16] without malice and let them know that
[1:32:19] love is corrective and that they might
[1:32:22] know that it's because of the hour that
[1:32:24] we're living in and the close coming of
[1:32:27] the Lord that we see great red lights
[1:32:30] flashing everywhere all over the world
[1:32:32] that the time is at hand May the people
[1:32:35] receive the Holy Ghost this day I pray
[1:32:37] and present them to you in the name of
[1:32:40] Jesus Christ and let it be a token to us
[1:32:43] as long as we live which you promised to
[1:32:47] be it's as easy as to ask because you
[1:32:51] promised it
[1:32:53] so it's easy for me to ask you Lord
[1:32:55] because you promised it and I know it
[1:32:57] will because you said it in the name of
[1:32:59] Jesus Christ we pray amen
[1:33:02] amen I I've wanted to read that for you
[1:33:04] because I do believe that's exactly my
[1:33:06] prayer I do believe that we're in that
[1:33:08] kind of an hour and may I just take a
[1:33:11] little part of this thought
[1:33:14] because
[1:33:16] as uh we all understand God gives us
[1:33:19] times and reasons and purposes but I
[1:33:22] want to just take this a little part and
[1:33:24] read out a little message called birth
[1:33:26] pains and two two little places here
[1:33:29] this morning I would like to read as
[1:33:31] quotes
[1:33:35] and
[1:33:38] pardon me
[1:33:39] I just read that from birth pains I
[1:33:41] wanted
[1:33:50] in Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:33:53] a very common a very common and very
[1:33:56] much preached so a message that we have
[1:33:58] that we have so loved and often quoted
[1:34:01] from and and brother Bram so makes known
[1:34:03] how that we are now in the age and the
[1:34:06] hour where God has opened up his
[1:34:09] complete mind and let us know what was
[1:34:11] in his mind before the foundation of the
[1:34:13] world we've often went across those
[1:34:15] things and just rejoiced them because
[1:34:16] for the first time we understand the
[1:34:18] things that that for the last 50 years
[1:34:21] we've been walking in the light of the
[1:34:23] open Word
[1:34:25] now it hasn't all been revealed to us
[1:34:28] personally and it comes gradually but uh
[1:34:31] it it is it is part of God's word and he
[1:34:35] has made it known
[1:34:37] that the Bible is the expression of the
[1:34:40] one gold that God had
[1:34:42] and our purpose
[1:34:44] he wants to achieve what he's had and
[1:34:47] then let me just now I chose you and
[1:34:49] reveals that that the Bible the entire
[1:34:52] Bible is the revelation of God's mystery
[1:34:55] in Christ
[1:34:56] and the entire Bible is an expression of
[1:34:59] the one goal that God had one purpose he
[1:35:02] wanted to achieve in the entire Bible
[1:35:04] and all the acts
[1:35:07] of the Believers in the Bible has been
[1:35:09] in type
[1:35:11] all the acts now just let your mind go
[1:35:14] then just begin to take some of those in
[1:35:16] which we won't take long a long time on
[1:35:17] that but we that's what we have Labor
[1:35:20] for every time we pick up a character we
[1:35:22] go to something else and next time you
[1:35:24] pick up different characters in The
[1:35:25] Bible and oh how it becomes real when
[1:35:27] you begin to deciphon you know it's the
[1:35:29] acts of the Believers that believe the
[1:35:31] message for that day and they acted out
[1:35:33] they were they were the word they became
[1:35:36] the Living Word
[1:35:38] God's always had skin on
[1:35:41] God's always had flesh around him
[1:35:44] he works he works through the to the
[1:35:46] vehicle of humanity
[1:35:49] what do you think let me just drop in
[1:35:51] there just I would say this is I not the
[1:35:53] Lord
[1:35:55] but we always say oh Lord give me more
[1:35:57] of you give me more of you oh fill me a
[1:36:00] new filming Lord make me so full of the
[1:36:02] Holy Ghost that I know Earthly good
[1:36:07] what would it be like if you were
[1:36:08] completely full of the Holy Ghost in
[1:36:10] every fiber of your being you would be
[1:36:12] no earthly good
[1:36:14] you wouldn't need a wife you wouldn't
[1:36:15] need a husband you wouldn't need
[1:36:16] children you wouldn't need any you you
[1:36:18] would just be so yeah you would just not
[1:36:20] why would plow the field why plant
[1:36:24] you speak the word
[1:36:26] why go through anything but see God
[1:36:28] gives us just enough of him to live here
[1:36:30] in this place in this body to love to
[1:36:34] live to grieve to pain to feel all these
[1:36:37] things and to know and to and to act out
[1:36:40] the attributes of God just like he has
[1:36:42] from the beginning
[1:36:44] he's the author of Love he's the author
[1:36:46] of pain he knows what pain is like he
[1:36:47] knows what it's like to be without why
[1:36:49] does he keep calling us why does he goes
[1:36:50] around the world and calls it he loves
[1:36:52] Fellowship
[1:36:53] that's one thing he was born in he why
[1:36:56] did why do you think why do you have a
[1:36:57] wife why do you have a bride now why my
[1:36:59] wife we're talking about being old now
[1:37:00] we're getting old and and uh we look at
[1:37:03] something he said ah it's too late to
[1:37:04] said well maybe we should fix it out nah
[1:37:06] it's too late
[1:37:07] um you know well we should maybe get
[1:37:09] this ah you know but I haven't got the
[1:37:11] energy
[1:37:13] I just turned 80 this year so it's a
[1:37:16] little different I never knew what
[1:37:17] somebody's asked me so why do you want
[1:37:18] to resign his Pastor said have you ever
[1:37:20] been 80 before
[1:37:21] no no okay when you get there then let
[1:37:25] me know
[1:37:27] it slowed down a little bit
[1:37:31] but I said you know what
[1:37:33] I want to stay with my wife as long as
[1:37:35] I'm here
[1:37:38] it's just the company
[1:37:40] the fellowship
[1:37:42] we've done well we've married 60 years
[1:37:45] this year and so we were counting back
[1:37:48] you know how we go back and we go back
[1:37:49] and we look back and say we and we'll
[1:37:51] come all the way back here to to
[1:37:52] Shreveport and we come to step into Gary
[1:37:55] and Barbara's Home and it's like home
[1:37:56] away from home
[1:37:58] Sandra's filling us all in and all the
[1:38:00] latest you know and telling she's got
[1:38:01] all the names and she she remembers the
[1:38:03] names we don't remember the names and
[1:38:05] and Barbara knows all the people
[1:38:08] and Gary's just standing there shifting
[1:38:09] gears
[1:38:12] good good old friends you know how it is
[1:38:16] but it feels good to walk in the house
[1:38:18] and just sit there with friends you can
[1:38:20] even talk about things that sometimes
[1:38:22] that's a little fishy so yeah but it's
[1:38:24] the principle of things
[1:38:26] don't ever be afraid to say well this
[1:38:28] this is off the word here this stuff if
[1:38:30] it's off the word get away from us
[1:38:32] and stay right with the word of God oh
[1:38:34] I'm so oh we should be so humble we
[1:38:36] should never talk about anything that oh
[1:38:38] and I want to talk about well our Lord
[1:38:40] wasn't that humble
[1:38:42] uh you know when they were there and
[1:38:44] around him and said ah this must be the
[1:38:47] devil working said well of course you
[1:38:49] said you're your father the devil
[1:38:51] if you were mine I said you'd believe me
[1:38:53] because my father wrote of me and the
[1:38:56] scripture declares who I am so he wasn't
[1:38:57] exactly oh what a gentleman he was yes
[1:39:00] he was a gentleman
[1:39:02] he know how to love like no one could
[1:39:05] he didn't know how to bear like no one
[1:39:06] could
[1:39:07] he know how to put up like no one is
[1:39:10] you you get sometimes said that's it
[1:39:12] I've had it
[1:39:13] whatever it is you know well he didn't
[1:39:16] do that
[1:39:17] when he said that's it
[1:39:19] I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna wipe them
[1:39:21] off I'm that's it I'm going to take care
[1:39:22] of them
[1:39:23] but you know what's ah wait a minute
[1:39:25] wait I remember Jacob no no no I can't
[1:39:29] destroy him I'll let him suffer but I
[1:39:31] won't I know I'll bring him back at the
[1:39:32] end
[1:39:34] no I can't destroy him he I promised
[1:39:37] Jacob
[1:39:39] I promised Israel how many times you
[1:39:41] know we get that way we get impatient
[1:39:43] and but but getting back to the thought
[1:39:45] if we were we God made us this way to
[1:39:48] have Fellowship
[1:39:50] and how God loves it just that's why
[1:39:52] it's not just in church we hear we come
[1:39:54] to praise and we worship you know I
[1:39:55] heard you're praising and and do the top
[1:39:58] of your lungs as you're coming in and
[1:40:00] worshiping
[1:40:01] what you believe is that God will accept
[1:40:03] it receive it because you you want him
[1:40:05] to you want to know how you feel
[1:40:07] you want to know that that I am a
[1:40:09] believer Lord
[1:40:11] and uh and we don't we we have a
[1:40:14] language that no one else has
[1:40:16] we don't have the devil's language say
[1:40:18] well I don't feel so good I don't know
[1:40:20] if I'm saved today or something that's
[1:40:21] the devil's language
[1:40:22] brother Brian said that's not God's
[1:40:24] language
[1:40:25] that's the devil's name said we speak
[1:40:27] those things where honorable truthful
[1:40:29] say I feel rotten today but I'm a son of
[1:40:31] God
[1:40:32] I don't feel like a Christian at all but
[1:40:34] I know I am
[1:40:36] I don't feel like getting up this
[1:40:37] morning but I'm getting up
[1:40:40] you're just throw in another shell you
[1:40:42] keep throwing another shell I do a
[1:40:43] little bit of hunting in my years now of
[1:40:45] course the only hunting I do now is in
[1:40:47] memory
[1:40:48] you know all those are good days oh
[1:40:50] those were good days oh how we did that
[1:40:52] oh how we did that and my guns are
[1:40:54] locked up in the in the case you know
[1:40:57] so it gets that way too finally finally
[1:40:59] you live a member but I'm glad I got a
[1:41:01] good I kind of like brother Ram said I I
[1:41:03] of all my pictures he said I'm glad they
[1:41:04] were made in Christ
[1:41:06] I'm glad I've been a Christian now for
[1:41:09] 50 well 60 years right when I was 19 I
[1:41:13] met my wife and the love of my life and
[1:41:15] we fell in love and it was there that
[1:41:17] that we realized both of us that we
[1:41:19] needed Christ well we were we're raised
[1:41:21] in Christian homes but but you know it's
[1:41:23] different to be raised in a Christian
[1:41:25] home than to be a Christian
[1:41:27] that when it comes in you then you begin
[1:41:29] to live out now say have you made
[1:41:30] mistakes oh I wouldn't want to go there
[1:41:34] have you come short every day
[1:41:36] David your backslid I'm going to say
[1:41:38] what the prophesied every day
[1:41:40] but he is not one moment that he has to
[1:41:43] stop being an intercessor
[1:41:45] Upon My Confession no matter how I feel
[1:41:48] how rotten we feel and sometimes I feel
[1:41:50] like totally unchristian and you made a
[1:41:53] mistake and you knew you made it and
[1:41:54] maybe you knew when you done but then I
[1:41:55] want remember I said but oh wait a
[1:41:57] minute
[1:41:58] where did I come from
[1:42:01] and where am I going back to
[1:42:03] I know I come from God and I'm going
[1:42:05] back to God I know that that I was in
[1:42:07] the bosom but God if I wasn't I never
[1:42:09] would have had eternal life but I know
[1:42:11] I've got eternal life because I believe
[1:42:12] the word for this age and I'm walking in
[1:42:14] it it's me I love it every part of it's
[1:42:17] me
[1:42:18] I'm glad to be a child of God in this
[1:42:21] age
[1:42:22] the darkest of all ages and the most
[1:42:24] deceptive of all ages now that's the one
[1:42:27] thing we don't want to get into this
[1:42:28] morning because that's the that's a
[1:42:30] challenge this is the this is the most
[1:42:32] deceptive age of all ages
[1:42:34] because Satan has had six thousand years
[1:42:38] of handling mankind
[1:42:39] he knows how to deceive
[1:42:43] just give him plenty
[1:42:44] everything they ask for give it to them
[1:42:48] that's a quick one
[1:42:50] that's what I say in all things of
[1:42:52] scripture when you hear the prophet he
[1:42:54] comes along and said but remember in all
[1:42:56] things
[1:42:57] if God blesses you thank him
[1:42:59] if God takes it thank him
[1:43:01] whatever you do always thank him because
[1:43:04] he knows what he's doing sometimes I've
[1:43:06] seen things that just impossible you
[1:43:08] think it's impossible for something good
[1:43:10] to come out of that
[1:43:12] you just said how in the world
[1:43:16] and you know what I'm talking about to
[1:43:18] some degree here in this Tabernacle with
[1:43:20] your Good Shepherd behind you
[1:43:23] how in the world
[1:43:25] sometimes think how can it be
[1:43:28] of God
[1:43:29] but God makes all things
[1:43:32] work together for good
[1:43:35] to them that love him
[1:43:37] and are called according to his purpose
[1:43:40] I don't know why Jesus had to die he
[1:43:42] could have had a different Plan of
[1:43:43] Redemption but he chose that plan
[1:43:45] we didn't choose it we didn't come here
[1:43:48] said I want to be a sinner our Sinners
[1:43:49] right be saved no we were born that way
[1:43:51] God designed it so
[1:43:53] he designed it so why do we hunger and
[1:43:56] thirst for God he designed it so you
[1:43:58] know the prophets that every man that's
[1:43:59] born of a woman thirsts after God but he
[1:44:02] doesn't know where he's at he doesn't
[1:44:03] know he goes to church and doesn't find
[1:44:04] him he goes to a religious order he goes
[1:44:06] to the Ballgame he doesn't find them but
[1:44:08] you just think look at all the
[1:44:09] entertainment this world's got
[1:44:11] what are they thirsting for what you are
[1:44:13] possessing this morning
[1:44:15] they're thirsting they don't know it
[1:44:18] if they knew what life you're possessing
[1:44:20] here today on that Eternal bosom of God
[1:44:23] Eternal seed of God that's there
[1:44:24] wouldn't be a place you wouldn't have to
[1:44:26] build this Tabernacle you couldn't hold
[1:44:28] them
[1:44:31] but God put skin around it and by doing
[1:44:34] that he hides it from the world
[1:44:37] God walking in Flesh on this Earth
[1:44:41] and they looked at him said looks like
[1:44:43] God Oh that's oh when he raised that oh
[1:44:47] my there's Lazar oh that must be God no
[1:44:50] no I look at who's hanging with look he
[1:44:52] goes it's has something to eat the
[1:44:55] Pharisees oh no no it can't be gone
[1:44:57] can't be gone
[1:44:59] now if God want to have that flesh
[1:45:00] around there
[1:45:02] they would have been identifying but God
[1:45:04] put flesh around his word
[1:45:06] and let you come short lecture be weak
[1:45:09] sometimes you struggle sometimes you
[1:45:11] think oh what Lord have I wasted my life
[1:45:15] have I wasted I've stood there now let's
[1:45:18] let's follow me a little bit
[1:45:20] 50
[1:45:22] some years I was there the night when
[1:45:25] brother Ram died
[1:45:27] at the time and you mind if I testify a
[1:45:30] little bit
[1:45:31] but my little wife at the time we were
[1:45:34] married for three years and she loved me
[1:45:37] and she loved the Lord but she'd been
[1:45:40] raised a certain way you know we all are
[1:45:42] out of our Mennonite Baptist Pentecost
[1:45:44] whatever and she she had been baptized
[1:45:46] in the titles of the father son holy
[1:45:48] ghost from immersion and everything and
[1:45:50] she uh
[1:45:53] I'll say this
[1:45:56] she's a real Jewel knocked on
[1:45:59] but I told her I showed her in the
[1:46:01] scripture said now it's wrong for a
[1:46:02] woman to cut her hair
[1:46:04] she stopped cutting her hair
[1:46:08] that's wrong to wear pants that becomes
[1:46:10] to a man's garment and wear shorts and
[1:46:13] so she laid them aside not because she
[1:46:16] wanted to or because real to her but she
[1:46:18] did it because she loved me
[1:46:21] and she just did it because
[1:46:24] we it seemed like a good thing to do
[1:46:28] but the night that brother Brown died
[1:46:30] and I say this this is my testimony this
[1:46:33] is my and hers testimony
[1:46:35] the night brother Brian died we were at
[1:46:37] her parents Christmas
[1:46:39] Eve and
[1:46:42] the you know the humbug of Christmas
[1:46:45] and uh it's not a very good word to say
[1:46:48] humbug about Christmas but
[1:46:51] I like the real Christ math not not even
[1:46:53] Christ's Mass just Christ's birthday
[1:46:55] but the holiday is Pagan but not the
[1:46:58] birth of Christ isn't paid
[1:47:01] we have our different opinions at times
[1:47:03] and there's some people they just get
[1:47:05] all carnal others real spiritual
[1:47:07] but just leaving that and we were there
[1:47:09] and having a Christmas with the family
[1:47:11] and uh we got a phone call and my
[1:47:14] brother-in-law called me and he said and
[1:47:16] we had been there in February hearing
[1:47:17] the marriage divorce series now it's
[1:47:19] December the same year and brother Brian
[1:47:21] has just died
[1:47:23] and when the phone when the when the
[1:47:25] phone rang and called my name I actually
[1:47:27] my brother-in-law said he's crying he
[1:47:29] said brother Brahm has just died
[1:47:32] and so we said a few words and and I and
[1:47:36] we were about two and a half hours from
[1:47:38] home
[1:47:38] and where her parents lived so we said
[1:47:41] goodbye and uh then I told Irene and
[1:47:45] well you know I'll have to be honest
[1:47:47] Christmas is over for me then
[1:47:49] after about a little while I was trying
[1:47:50] to be a gentleman I said the family
[1:47:52] after a while so do you mind if I just
[1:47:54] slip out a little bit and I told her I
[1:47:56] said I need to go upstairs I need I need
[1:47:57] to pray and be honest and uh
[1:48:01] because I because we believed when God
[1:48:04] would take the angel that we were going
[1:48:06] with him
[1:48:07] let me clarify that a little bit
[1:48:09] all of you are very familiar with the
[1:48:11] first second and third poll but when
[1:48:14] brother Brown started preaching the
[1:48:15] third poor Ministry
[1:48:18] to some people it became confusing
[1:48:20] factors I've had men ministers tell me
[1:48:22] he said ah after he preached when he got
[1:48:25] there and started teaching the words
[1:48:26] that it just became confusing to me I I
[1:48:28] just I like the science and the American
[1:48:30] wonders just exactly what he knew would
[1:48:33] happen
[1:48:35] when he started preaching the third Paul
[1:48:38] you know what he says it's it's like
[1:48:41] getting settling down he talks about
[1:48:43] getting in the capsule he talks about
[1:48:45] buttoning down he says now remember it's
[1:48:48] out of your hands and I'm not going to
[1:48:50] preach around that but I just say that
[1:48:51] he said it's out of your hands now just
[1:48:54] sittle and sit down and buckle down he
[1:48:56] said
[1:48:57] he's going to do the rest of it and so
[1:49:00] we had all kinds of images of how it's
[1:49:02] going to happen you know we're we're
[1:49:04] human beings but we've got the Rapture
[1:49:05] all figured out sometimes and so wait a
[1:49:07] minute we got many things figured out we
[1:49:10] had kind of figured out that Jesus was
[1:49:13] coming now for his bride
[1:49:15] and I got such a burden because my wife
[1:49:16] wasn't saved
[1:49:18] I
[1:49:20] I believe it's just saved
[1:49:22] but I stood on later on she wouldn't be
[1:49:23] in the first resurrection the bride
[1:49:25] there's a difference of being saved
[1:49:27] and being the first blessed they have
[1:49:29] part in the first resurrection there are
[1:49:32] those that we know and that number is
[1:49:33] even given to where we don't even want
[1:49:35] to go there that's not our business some
[1:49:37] people have asked sometimes what do you
[1:49:38] think about that and say wait a minute
[1:49:39] that's not me I'm not in the tribulation
[1:49:41] period
[1:49:42] say what do you think will happen to the
[1:49:44] tribulation said I don't want to be here
[1:49:45] that's all
[1:49:47] I don't know I have no intention of
[1:49:49] being here during the tribulation period
[1:49:51] my my goal is set my hope is built well
[1:49:54] that night when finally in about an hour
[1:49:56] later she come up and I was already
[1:49:58] laying in bed I've been praying and uh
[1:50:00] and she got in bed and I put her arms
[1:50:04] around her we laid them I started
[1:50:05] talking I said honey do you know what
[1:50:07] this means this could be before another
[1:50:10] day or the next day or we don't know but
[1:50:12] this this could be anytime within 40
[1:50:15] days
[1:50:16] they're gonna be a bride going is that
[1:50:19] all I want to do is I want to see you
[1:50:20] then I want to be there too we started
[1:50:22] talking we started praying and as God is
[1:50:25] my witness and I I hope I don't bore you
[1:50:26] with this part but you know we love
[1:50:29] those things when God does things you'll
[1:50:31] never forget them
[1:50:33] because they're
[1:50:34] they're that's my property
[1:50:37] we start praying
[1:50:39] and neither one talking we must delayed
[1:50:42] different hour just we couldn't pray
[1:50:44] because loud because we're in their home
[1:50:46] so we didn't want to disturb them too
[1:50:48] much and we're starting to pray and
[1:50:51] Connie was a little girl she had in the
[1:50:53] crib and she started fussing
[1:50:55] and Irene was going to get up but she
[1:50:59] she just felt no no just let her fuss
[1:51:01] well she she fussed a little while and
[1:51:03] then she stopped crying and while we're
[1:51:05] praying eyes closed dark in the room all
[1:51:08] of a sudden there's like I this is my
[1:51:10] testimony like a like a human form in
[1:51:13] front of my bed right in my feet like
[1:51:15] Satan would just standing there
[1:51:17] I didn't open my eyes and I'll tell you
[1:51:19] that honestly I was fearful
[1:51:22] I kept praying
[1:51:23] and all of a sudden
[1:51:25] as the as I kept praying all of a sudden
[1:51:28] I felt something and I noticed that my
[1:51:30] eyes closed now you know I sometimes
[1:51:31] light when your eyes are closed your
[1:51:33] Lids are still light it ain't in light
[1:51:35] all of a sudden that very figure was so
[1:51:37] black turned all white
[1:51:39] now I was afraid to open my eyes again
[1:51:42] for fear I'd see the angel of the Lord
[1:51:45] I kept on praying kept on praying
[1:51:47] finally but we I'd say about an hour and
[1:51:50] it quiet and we quietened down
[1:51:52] and I began to tell her I said honey you
[1:51:54] know what just happened and she said and
[1:51:57] when I told her she said that's exactly
[1:51:58] what I saw
[1:52:01] I saw the same thing and it became White
[1:52:03] all over it
[1:52:05] well we don't make anything of it it was
[1:52:06] just a visit whatever it was but
[1:52:08] something happened
[1:52:10] we were not home
[1:52:12] and I was working shift work for the
[1:52:15] company I was working for and and uh
[1:52:17] started at four o'clock in the afternoon
[1:52:19] and and uh so about three my wife fixed
[1:52:22] some lunch and getting me ready and I
[1:52:24] fix my lunch kit and so on she did I
[1:52:26] said she fixed my lunch kit if I would
[1:52:28] have fixed it it wouldn't be fair it'd
[1:52:30] be fixed all right I'll leave the
[1:52:32] cooking to her
[1:52:33] but anyhow
[1:52:35] she was doing some ironing after that
[1:52:36] and we were we I turned on the tape and
[1:52:39] we were listening to a part of the tape
[1:52:40] before I went to work
[1:52:42] and uh
[1:52:44] when I shut the tape off some of the
[1:52:46] members kind of fake it foggy but she
[1:52:49] said
[1:52:49] minnow said
[1:52:51] I have I have need to be re-baptized in
[1:52:54] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:52:57] and I knew right there that that she's
[1:52:58] not said much about that night
[1:53:00] but
[1:53:02] from that time
[1:53:04] we went to Jeffersonville in February of
[1:53:07] 1966 and she was baptized in the name of
[1:53:11] the Lord Jesus Christ and from that time
[1:53:14] I didn't have to tell her to stop
[1:53:16] wearing pants and shorts and she always
[1:53:19] even didn't like the messenger too much
[1:53:20] because she was a little bit more
[1:53:21] educated than brother Brown's verbs and
[1:53:23] adverbs and some of them wasn't very you
[1:53:25] know you know how we are sometimes think
[1:53:28] oh he didn't say that quite right he
[1:53:29] should have said this way suddenly God
[1:53:31] even changed her understanding and and I
[1:53:34] say this to the glory of God from that
[1:53:35] time she had a personal identification
[1:53:39] and realized that her eyes would come
[1:53:41] open
[1:53:42] something I could not have done
[1:53:45] in fact when I was when brother Brian
[1:53:47] was you know in the marriage divorce
[1:53:49] series every time he he closes the
[1:53:51] meetings uh who is this Melchizedek and
[1:53:53] so on when he closed the meeting he
[1:53:54] always had a prayer and and uh my
[1:53:59] my brother-in-law we were five brothers
[1:54:01] that driven driven from Jeffersonville
[1:54:03] or from Saskatoon to Jeffersonville
[1:54:05] never crossed the border in our life for
[1:54:07] the first time we drove clear through in
[1:54:09] Minneapolis and on the way to uh
[1:54:12] Jeffersonville when we got over there we
[1:54:15] said we don't know Jefferson but we
[1:54:16] don't know anything about it and but I
[1:54:18] said I remember brother talks about New
[1:54:19] Albany Inn so we looked on the map went
[1:54:22] to New Albany there was then so we we
[1:54:24] booked in and and we were we had been
[1:54:27] driving for two days and two nights in
[1:54:29] the same clothes and uh the same hair
[1:54:32] good thing we had real cream in those
[1:54:33] days so you keep your hair down and and
[1:54:36] mine were still black then by the way
[1:54:37] hey they were still black every once in
[1:54:41] a while forget about that and then my
[1:54:42] wife shows me a picture I saw a picture
[1:54:44] the other day and had black hair
[1:54:46] I kind of feel like brother rabbit said
[1:54:48] wherever they were I'm coming back to
[1:54:51] them
[1:54:52] I believe we're coming back to them I
[1:54:54] believe we'll be young forever
[1:54:57] I believe that this is my story this is
[1:55:00] my song
[1:55:01] we're going to be young that what we
[1:55:04] feel now in our soul we know now it
[1:55:06] comes from somewhere that's eternal
[1:55:08] that comes from the bosom of God and is
[1:55:11] drip down here that's what God had in
[1:55:13] mind
[1:55:14] that's what he wants that's his whole
[1:55:15] purpose now you see it we love nice
[1:55:18] buildings and we too we built a new
[1:55:19] building but you know what it's all
[1:55:22] volcanic ash
[1:55:24] even these bodies but the soul it's
[1:55:28] eternal
[1:55:30] when we were in Jeffersonville
[1:55:33] and
[1:55:35] we we walked into the tap well well they
[1:55:38] they said the meeting starts on Thursday
[1:55:40] and so said uh we were all you know
[1:55:43] unshaven hadn't shaved for two days and
[1:55:45] I probably smelled like pole cats I
[1:55:47] don't know but but we was we was didn't
[1:55:49] even have a shot we said well he'd do
[1:55:51] that later or we don't have supper and
[1:55:53] then we'll tomorrow the service started
[1:55:55] someone said let's go find the
[1:55:56] Tabernacle so eighth and Penn so we
[1:55:58] looked it up on the map and we found
[1:56:00] drive up to the Tabernacle and there's
[1:56:02] cars everywhere
[1:56:03] all around the Tabernacle and uh we say
[1:56:07] oh it must be served well it was
[1:56:08] Wednesday night and here brother Brian
[1:56:10] was speaking so we'll walk to the door
[1:56:11] and the Deacon said there's no room said
[1:56:13] there's no room there's there's and oh
[1:56:16] we felt so bad said couldn't we put
[1:56:18] chairs in we put chairs everywhere
[1:56:19] there's nowhere we can get in and uh
[1:56:22] then one of the deacons came from the
[1:56:24] back said just somebody just been tapped
[1:56:25] him on the shoulder and he went out into
[1:56:27] the Tabernacle and he come back within a
[1:56:30] minute or so and said uh
[1:56:31] you know how many's been in the old
[1:56:34] Tabernacle all right well it's got you
[1:56:36] know the two aisles and then it's got
[1:56:38] the two doors going like that well as
[1:56:39] brother Brown was standing here the the
[1:56:41] aisle that came down that way right
[1:56:43] where you go out the Deacon said we're
[1:56:45] going to put five chairs there and you
[1:56:46] can sit there but when the meeting ends
[1:56:49] you've got to get up and uh so the Fire
[1:56:52] Marshall uh won't let you sit there once
[1:56:54] we stand because then people will leave
[1:56:55] and uh so we walked in Just The Way We
[1:56:59] Were and uh I had not maybe sat five
[1:57:02] minutes hearing brother Brown here or he
[1:57:04] was just taking his text
[1:57:06] running from the presence of the Lord he
[1:57:07] just taken this text
[1:57:09] and that's the last I remember about
[1:57:11] what I looked like what what I felt like
[1:57:14] didn't make it I would I think I
[1:57:16] probably cried right through the whole
[1:57:17] service
[1:57:18] I knew that God had given me Grace to
[1:57:22] see the angel of the message of the
[1:57:25] Covenant of God not the man
[1:57:28] I'm so glad God gives us the revelation
[1:57:30] of that
[1:57:31] it was the veil that covered
[1:57:34] the gift of God
[1:57:35] and the gift that's in you is the veil
[1:57:37] that covers you are sometimes a human
[1:57:38] what stumbles people many times is the
[1:57:40] Veil
[1:57:41] so how could this man he's such a man of
[1:57:43] God and then make a mistake like that
[1:57:45] doing things that be careful yeah this
[1:57:48] Bible tells it all
[1:57:50] brother Brown says what I like about the
[1:57:51] Bible it doesn't talk about just David
[1:57:53] how great he was
[1:57:56] tell us about the dirty laundry he had
[1:57:57] too
[1:57:58] tells about our life sometimes so many
[1:58:01] times oh I don't want I don't I don't
[1:58:04] hope that never becomes public right
[1:58:07] am I condoning sin non-belief never
[1:58:11] but we are I'll say this
[1:58:13] there is a fountain filled with grace
[1:58:17] no matter how low you get
[1:58:19] or how far you fall away
[1:58:21] if that seed lays there he is
[1:58:24] responsible
[1:58:25] to his own life
[1:58:28] he is responsible
[1:58:30] he's not even I can't keep myself you
[1:58:32] can't keep yourself
[1:58:34] but when brother bran preached that
[1:58:36] message there that did it for me and my
[1:58:38] brother-in-law as I said earlier uh
[1:58:42] he was sitting there and one night he
[1:58:44] said you know I I would like to show
[1:58:45] brother Graham to pray for me and uh
[1:58:49] and he said but I I asked some of the
[1:58:51] deacons said no brother Brian's not
[1:58:52] praying for everybody personally it's
[1:58:54] just a discernment said you have to wait
[1:58:55] on the Lord if he calls you then then
[1:58:58] that's the blessing you get well
[1:59:01] we prayed every night of course you know
[1:59:03] how it is like that's the night the
[1:59:04] second night where I prayed and I read
[1:59:06] it was praying for her I said now to my
[1:59:08] wife and I for my wife I should say I
[1:59:10] said Lord
[1:59:12] show her to me show me what will happen
[1:59:14] well he didn't
[1:59:17] you know God knew better
[1:59:19] might have might have done something I
[1:59:21] don't know what but my brother-in-law as
[1:59:24] brother but he watched the first night
[1:59:25] second night third night when he saw the
[1:59:27] way brother Billy would take brother
[1:59:28] Brown as soon as they start singing
[1:59:29] after the prayer discernment He Slipped
[1:59:31] him out to the side so my brother-in-law
[1:59:33] went and stood by the door
[1:59:34] and you brother REM had to pass by there
[1:59:37] and uh sure enough here come brother
[1:59:39] Brown Billy leading brother Branham and
[1:59:41] kind of Rush him out
[1:59:43] and brother Brown just walked right I
[1:59:45] was just walking through the be like my
[1:59:46] brother walked back to him just stopped
[1:59:48] and uh laid a hand on his shoulder and
[1:59:51] prayed exactly
[1:59:52] word for word what he was going to ask
[1:59:54] for the brown
[1:59:58] and he just walked out
[2:00:00] well when George George had tears of
[2:00:03] Sorrow before when he came out he said
[2:00:04] tears of joy he said it's over said it's
[2:00:07] lifted
[2:00:08] said I couldn't understand how this
[2:00:10] could have happened in my life there's
[2:00:11] something in his life he said I couldn't
[2:00:13] have couldn't believe that God could
[2:00:14] forgive that
[2:00:17] he said but
[2:00:18] he showed me
[2:00:21] that is greater
[2:00:25] is greater I think he run over some boys
[2:00:28] one time when he was younger he was a
[2:00:29] delivery man
[2:00:30] and two little boys dashed out of the
[2:00:34] road
[2:00:35] and uh
[2:00:36] he killed one of them
[2:00:38] and every time he would talk about that
[2:00:41] he'd be something changed in him
[2:00:45] you know he took felt like he'd taken
[2:00:47] the he should have been more careful
[2:00:48] your heart is blamed him and but he said
[2:00:51] that that night when brother Brian
[2:00:53] prayed when brother bam said that just
[2:00:54] prayed just about five words he just had
[2:00:56] a few words he said that's all he said
[2:00:58] and that from that time I knew God had
[2:01:00] heard my prayer
[2:01:03] he's a great God
[2:01:06] he knows how to handle sin
[2:01:09] he knows how to handle
[2:01:13] the works
[2:01:15] and put it together
[2:01:17] now we know when we really look at the
[2:01:19] scripture in which I'm I'm maybe just
[2:01:22] breathe just one more thing here but in
[2:01:25] all of the of all of the revelations of
[2:01:28] the entire mystery of Christ
[2:01:30] it has always God veiled behind flesh
[2:01:35] so much so that they were gods to the
[2:01:37] age
[2:01:39] the prophets were called
[2:01:41] they were the word of God to that age if
[2:01:44] this age could recognize that God
[2:01:46] himself was spoke again now in this last
[2:01:48] day not outside of the Bible but
[2:01:51] confirming the word
[2:01:54] didn't make a new Bible he remember how
[2:01:55] brother Brahma even says about the Seven
[2:01:57] Seals he's talking about him all the
[2:01:58] time he said oh it's not even written in
[2:02:00] the book it's the back side of the book
[2:02:01] it's not even written about the third
[2:02:03] seal he says wait a minute wait a minute
[2:02:04] and he starts correcting it
[2:02:07] has had been there all the time said but
[2:02:09] it was hidden from us
[2:02:12] well we wouldn't know what we wouldn't
[2:02:13] understand the voice of God in this age
[2:02:15] at all if if God hadn't opened our
[2:02:17] understanding and and hadn't fulfilled
[2:02:19] it but all of a sudden the word began to
[2:02:21] walk again on Earth
[2:02:22] in its fullness and this time we know
[2:02:25] there's not enough the message to follow
[2:02:27] there's not an eighth angel
[2:02:29] and you know that's been we've had all
[2:02:31] the doctrines around us we have a church
[2:02:32] splits and of every kind and we've got
[2:02:34] them still and we probably will have
[2:02:36] them till the day that we walk off of
[2:02:37] here but somebody is going to walk with
[2:02:40] off of this Earth one of these days
[2:02:41] somebody's gonna we're not all staying
[2:02:44] here
[2:02:45] no sir
[2:02:47] I like that
[2:02:49] somebody's leaving
[2:02:51] and I'd like even to take the first to
[2:02:53] second third exit the show brother Brian
[2:02:55] talks about the preachers of those
[2:02:56] messages that said to every believer
[2:02:58] that comes from the bosom of God
[2:03:01] that Faith produces the works of God
[2:03:07] if the seed that lays in you and I how
[2:03:10] can it disbelieve the word of God
[2:03:12] when it comes from the bosom of God
[2:03:15] how could you say oh I I well that was
[2:03:19] for yesterday impossible
[2:03:21] impossible the spirit of God does not
[2:03:24] deny his own word
[2:03:26] that's how you know you know sometimes
[2:03:27] people say oh well we better check out
[2:03:29] see if the prophet's right or not I I
[2:03:31] heard him say this I'm going to try and
[2:03:32] see if he's right or not
[2:03:35] the word comes to the prophets
[2:03:38] you want to find out if your Revelation
[2:03:40] is right go back to the word and say see
[2:03:43] if it fits together from Genesis to
[2:03:44] Revelations that's your Revelation if it
[2:03:47] doesn't and it says it's something
[2:03:48] different than what the angel said you'd
[2:03:51] read it again I'd encourage you to read
[2:03:53] it again
[2:03:54] because the word of the Lord comes to
[2:03:57] the prophet
[2:03:59] doesn't come to the teacher the pastor
[2:04:01] that sometimes we love great teaching
[2:04:04] but how great can teaching come when it
[2:04:06] starts leaving the word of God
[2:04:08] we've seen Great Men even around the
[2:04:10] species I'm talking Masters great
[2:04:12] understanding begin to take it and begin
[2:04:14] to move away
[2:04:17] just stay there where God said what he
[2:04:19] said whether whether we see it sometimes
[2:04:20] we don't see it happen
[2:04:22] we just wait a while
[2:04:25] but see what happens it brings forth
[2:04:28] this fruit for the for the word of God
[2:04:32] always brings forth the word the seed of
[2:04:35] the word for this age the message that
[2:04:37] this Angel spoke to us when he got to
[2:04:40] the third pool and they began to talk
[2:04:41] about they said well where's the sign
[2:04:43] that you used to have where's it he said
[2:04:44] it's still here then he would go and
[2:04:46] demonstrate it again said look show my
[2:04:48] hand it's still there see but he went
[2:04:50] further went on now to Perfection not
[2:04:53] another message
[2:04:55] you know he never went and you know he
[2:04:57] did correct some things along the way we
[2:04:59] know that like when he preached the
[2:05:01] Seven Seals
[2:05:03] he actually stops and said you know what
[2:05:06] I uh I I preached him all as being the
[2:05:09] white horse rider being Christ writing
[2:05:10] forth
[2:05:12] he said I took Larkins I took different
[2:05:13] ones and read him he's a man
[2:05:16] but God said now it won't work the time
[2:05:18] has come now said I'm going to let you
[2:05:20] correct that
[2:05:23] for the who could correct the heir of
[2:05:25] the Prophet only the god of the prophet
[2:05:29] because it must come to the prophet to
[2:05:31] be corrected
[2:05:33] sure sometimes we get stopped every
[2:05:34] people you know we ministers they get
[2:05:36] they give you questions you know how
[2:05:38] sometimes uh brother Brown will say
[2:05:40] things and he said now now you can be
[2:05:42] justified without being Sanctified
[2:05:43] you'll be Sanctified without the baptism
[2:05:45] the Holy Ghost well one brother showed
[2:05:47] me a quote and said now brother man what
[2:05:49] do you think what was happening he said
[2:05:50] you couldn't be Sanctified without being
[2:05:53] justified
[2:05:56] and he said nothing brother stops and
[2:05:58] said you can be justified without being
[2:05:59] Sanctified yeah but he said he said it
[2:06:01] here this way and now I said it here
[2:06:02] this way which is right
[2:06:05] I said you don't have to be a
[2:06:07] mathematician to figure that one out
[2:06:09] just the way it says now he he but he
[2:06:12] starts out saying you could be
[2:06:13] sanctified
[2:06:15] without being justified
[2:06:18] now that's not the scriptural but he
[2:06:20] corrects it immediately and says Ah he
[2:06:23] didn't say oh I was wrong he just said
[2:06:24] he quotes it again but this time he said
[2:06:26] you could be justified brother being
[2:06:27] Sanctified I said now that's that's I
[2:06:29] know I didn't want to hurt his feelings
[2:06:31] but I said now now that's just
[2:06:33] search the scripture what does it say
[2:06:36] take the whole path of God justification
[2:06:38] sanctification back from the Holy Ghost
[2:06:40] and even for the Holy Ghost himself now
[2:06:42] impersonating impersonating himself
[2:06:45] embodied
[2:06:47] because this time
[2:06:50] it's not an individual person that's
[2:06:51] leaving here it's the many membered body
[2:06:54] with the seed of God in them
[2:06:57] what a glorious light that you walk in
[2:06:59] this day
[2:07:00] I'm grateful to be walking this light I
[2:07:02] don't know if I if how long I'll be able
[2:07:04] to walk in this life
[2:07:06] but I but I but I don't regret a mind
[2:07:09] I don't regret the times I've had to
[2:07:11] stand there like you have done stood
[2:07:13] there and said Lord you said it I
[2:07:14] believe it that settles it
[2:07:16] just as sick as you were before
[2:07:20] God always lets us have something in our
[2:07:22] life that we that we need to hold to
[2:07:25] keep us humble even watch brother
[2:07:26] Branham home so many times I think of
[2:07:29] often I'd wondered why right at the end
[2:07:31] of his ministry
[2:07:33] when he when he when he got it revealed
[2:07:35] all the Mysteries and and uh and and he
[2:07:39] gets all worked up about how the people
[2:07:41] are not taking his message anymore
[2:07:44] he knows they won't
[2:07:46] but he feels so hurt that they rejected
[2:07:48] down rejected Christ and rejected the
[2:07:51] Vindicated word but he knows they can't
[2:07:53] believe Because unless they're in God's
[2:07:54] good and they can't believe it he knows
[2:07:56] that but we all know that too but we we
[2:07:58] preach and try to convince people anyhow
[2:08:00] but if the seed lays there it'll Quicken
[2:08:02] if it doesn't lay there you can pour as
[2:08:05] much water on there as you want it'll
[2:08:06] never come up again
[2:08:08] but it but it hurts and yet sometimes
[2:08:11] brother when I heard reading from the
[2:08:12] presence of the Lord are not not that
[2:08:14] one was where it talks about uh going up
[2:08:17] up to Alaska and you know tricking his
[2:08:20] wife to go with him and a human being a
[2:08:23] man
[2:08:24] just enough Veil
[2:08:27] to hide it
[2:08:29] from the wise of the prudent I heard a
[2:08:31] man say well you know in closing I say
[2:08:33] that heard a man say a while ago they
[2:08:35] were talking about brother Branham and
[2:08:37] he brought up and said he was talking
[2:08:39] about what a great man he was what a
[2:08:41] great ministry he had
[2:08:43] and uh he was a moderator and he's
[2:08:46] talking about oh I said there was never
[2:08:47] there's not a man that had a Ministry
[2:08:49] like William Branham he said and but as
[2:08:52] he went on he said and then we started
[2:08:54] teaching he said I said I believe that's
[2:08:57] why God took William Brown off the scene
[2:08:59] had him killed in the wreck so that he
[2:09:01] wouldn't be lost
[2:09:05] and I heard it and I thought oh my
[2:09:07] I don't understand why God like here
[2:09:09] we're talking about brother brother
[2:09:11] retief
[2:09:13] Gideon
[2:09:14] now why would God take a pastor
[2:09:17] out of a congregation and I know him
[2:09:19] real well I knew his mama and daddy both
[2:09:21] of them and and Andre and Linda and and
[2:09:25] I and God just pulled Gideon out let him
[2:09:30] die of a heart attack in the middle of
[2:09:31] the highway
[2:09:33] I don't understand it
[2:09:35] but that's not my business
[2:09:37] that's God's business
[2:09:39] there's a lot of things we don't we
[2:09:41] don't know
[2:09:42] but we're used to sing that song We'll
[2:09:44] understand it by and by
[2:09:47] but I'm going to say this it probably
[2:09:49] won't matter by and by
[2:09:52] it probably won't matter at all
[2:09:55] I said why did I have that why did my
[2:09:57] crop fail last year again oh my goodness
[2:09:59] well then I'm now you wake up on the
[2:10:01] other side and said okay
[2:10:03] what's the matter don't matter anymore
[2:10:04] now
[2:10:05] this crop will not fail
[2:10:08] this time there'll be no more Graves
[2:10:10] preached than when our funeral is
[2:10:11] preached I've preached of many a funeral
[2:10:13] at my age
[2:10:15] I've wept like a human being
[2:10:19] but I've rejoiced and all that many of
[2:10:22] them are planted in the name of Jesus
[2:10:24] Christ knowing they're going to come out
[2:10:26] in the first resurrection
[2:10:28] we'll stand here on Earth we'll be
[2:10:30] gathered with them here
[2:10:32] I believe you with all my heart
[2:10:34] somebody said is brother Ram come back
[2:10:36] absolutely
[2:10:38] he's one of the ages
[2:10:40] when he had that beyond the vision for
[2:10:42] him he said what the Lord told him said
[2:10:43] remember you're responsible for the
[2:10:45] message of this age you'll be gathered
[2:10:47] with your own
[2:10:49] I'm not ashamed to say that I believe
[2:10:51] that God sent an angel to turn the
[2:10:53] hearts of the children back to the faith
[2:10:55] of the fathers where we know whether we
[2:10:58] come from the bosom of God and we're
[2:10:59] going back to the bosom of God
[2:11:02] when you brother the Bible says if you
[2:11:03] ever hear that that William Brown died
[2:11:05] he said don't you believe it
[2:11:07] that I've just changed the address
[2:11:09] now I feel the same way I've said that
[2:11:11] many times his funeral said no they
[2:11:14] didn't die they just changed the address
[2:11:15] the humanity is gone but their soul went
[2:11:18] on said ah finally would come to its
[2:11:20] rest
[2:11:21] the labors are finished God bless this
[2:11:23] Tabernacle this church I like that
[2:11:25] little prayer that brother Brown prayed
[2:11:27] may he bless it and keep it and when
[2:11:29] Jesus comes in the little Rapture now I
[2:11:31] know he appears before he comes this is
[2:11:33] his appearing but there is a physical
[2:11:35] physical coming where these bodies will
[2:11:38] have a Rapture too this body still Ages
[2:11:41] Every Day
[2:11:42] and if we don't meet again here there's
[2:11:44] one thing we do hope for and Trust for
[2:11:47] they're going to meet us young men young
[2:11:49] women
[2:11:50] in a body that can never never die
[2:11:53] here we've got no continuous City
[2:11:57] do you know what can I have the
[2:11:59] musicians come up and sing a song
[2:12:03] I don't know why but I just want to sing
[2:12:05] this world is not my home
[2:12:07] I'm just the passing through
[2:12:10] my treasures are lied up
[2:12:12] I don't know where they're laid out but
[2:12:14] I know they're laid up in the bosom of
[2:12:16] God
[2:12:17] I said how could we all come you know
[2:12:18] what's what it means it comes from the
[2:12:20] mind of God from the reality of God God
[2:12:23] spoke it and so it is
[2:12:25] we all knew that
[2:12:33] brother Timothy if you've still got a
[2:12:36] message you go ahead and finish it here
[2:12:40] it's been good for me to be here today
[2:12:42] and my wife and I we're traveling
[2:12:44] through I we're heading towards Ohio and
[2:12:47] Ohio has always been one of those places
[2:12:49] as well everybody has what we call
[2:12:52] special places and some of you people
[2:12:54] that come up from different places and
[2:12:56] the brother back there said I shook his
[2:12:59] hand said I said you don't belong here I
[2:13:02] said yes I do I came here about a year
[2:13:03] and a half ago or something like that he
[2:13:05] was a song leader in Cloverdale there in
[2:13:08] yes of course
[2:13:10] don't ask me the name of it
[2:13:14] but it's so glad to see and each of you
[2:13:16] that's been here that's moved here
[2:13:18] something drew you here
[2:13:21] we must believe that all of those steps
[2:13:24] of the righteous are ordered of the Lord
[2:13:27] I remember when we had the great breakup
[2:13:29] in the in the in the over the Perugia
[2:13:31] Doctrine in our congregation
[2:13:33] and you know it's the hardest thing in
[2:13:36] my whole Christian walk that I've ever
[2:13:38] made a decision and I was given the
[2:13:40] opportunity I was given the ultimatum
[2:13:43] this this this and this or out you go
[2:13:49] and you know one of the things that came
[2:13:50] to my rescue
[2:13:52] I kind of like the way the brother Ram
[2:13:53] said my recipe
[2:13:56] what came to my rescue was the word of
[2:13:58] God
[2:14:00] and the pastor then God bless your soul
[2:14:02] I believe I'll meet him again
[2:14:04] in the Rapture but the doctrine had
[2:14:08] filtered into the church so powerfully
[2:14:09] that it just began to break it up and
[2:14:12] when they gave me the ultimatum of what
[2:14:13] to do either stay and get knocked down
[2:14:15] towards on or you can't preach you can't
[2:14:18] pray you can't sing you can't won't be
[2:14:20] supported I said
[2:14:22] I look gentlemen and the Holy Spirit
[2:14:23] come to my rescue and said Just remember
[2:14:26] this
[2:14:27] he said
[2:14:28] if the church called me
[2:14:31] then let the church take care of me
[2:14:33] but if God calls you God will take care
[2:14:35] of you
[2:14:37] he did
[2:14:39] he did I got kicked out but you know
[2:14:42] what
[2:14:42] not out of the Kingdom
[2:14:45] I'm still in the kingdom and you know
[2:14:47] what I found out he's never left me all
[2:14:49] the 35 years I've been 36 years of
[2:14:52] pastoring there and it was exactly
[2:14:56] if you you someday we'll one you
[2:14:58] understand but you we can't we don't
[2:15:00] have time but you know how you know God
[2:15:02] told you to do this go there and do that
[2:15:04] and you tried and it didn't work out
[2:15:06] said oh I can't be of God that's it all
[2:15:08] right thank you Lord
[2:15:10] but it is if it is of god
[2:15:13] sometimes there's a long way around do
[2:15:15] you remember brother brown with a tax
[2:15:16] case and everything and I said that he
[2:15:18] had been disobedient he says he said I
[2:15:20] practically I'm standing in the Pulpit
[2:15:21] right now with this over my shoulders he
[2:15:24] said I the Lord told me India not Africa
[2:15:27] or Africa not India remember that and he
[2:15:29] said I got to go make that thing right
[2:15:31] he said I got to get off my shoulder but
[2:15:33] then he looks back and he takes about
[2:15:34] the CAT tax case and he takes a whole
[2:15:36] circle and said you know honey I'm free
[2:15:39] remember when they paid off they got the
[2:15:40] bill in the loan so he said I'm free I'm
[2:15:41] free honey I'm let's go for a ride so
[2:15:44] they went driving he said I'm free and
[2:15:46] he looked back and said honey said for
[2:15:48] five years
[2:15:50] for five years I've wondered said but
[2:15:53] this day it's over
[2:15:54] sometimes it takes a while I've been
[2:15:57] there it took me five years I wondered I
[2:16:00] made a circle for five years I ended up
[2:16:02] in Ohio
[2:16:04] knew the Lord sent me there but it said
[2:16:06] for a year that I knew when he told me
[2:16:08] get out and go back
[2:16:10] five years amazing one day I'm sitting
[2:16:12] there reading that same message and
[2:16:15] we've just started the church in
[2:16:16] Saskatoon 1984.
[2:16:19] of April the 17th
[2:16:21] after we got put out and I read a little
[2:16:24] message and I counted back
[2:16:27] from April 79 to April 84.
[2:16:31] five years I said honey I'm free
[2:16:35] I've been the pastor there now for those
[2:16:37] years since 1984.
[2:16:40] and I don't know if I'm in the will of
[2:16:41] God now or not
[2:16:44] but Dwayne is the pastor there now
[2:16:47] it's been one of the hardest things to
[2:16:48] do at times you know how it is I don't
[2:16:50] want to fail the Lord but I do know this
[2:16:53] I get there was something come up and I
[2:16:54] gave it to commission to the Lord and I
[2:16:56] said Lord if you work it out I'll follow
[2:16:58] you
[2:17:00] you just leave me I know I could be gone
[2:17:02] tomorrow we know that already I'm living
[2:17:05] on board time but I thank him for all
[2:17:08] the time
