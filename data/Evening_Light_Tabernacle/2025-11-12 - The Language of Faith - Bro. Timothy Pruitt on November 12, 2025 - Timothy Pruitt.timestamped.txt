[24:27] in me.
[24:30] We bow our hearts and [music] heads
[24:32] tonight.
[24:34] Father, we're so privileged.
[24:37] We feel honored to come [music] and to
[24:39] your August presence this evening.
[24:43] Lord, where you are, there's fullness of
[24:46] joy.
[24:49] Lord, it caused a blind man [music] to
[24:51] receive his sight one day. Just being in
[24:54] your presence changed everything.
[24:57] Lord, as we come into your service
[24:58] [music] tonight, we ask, Lord, that
[25:00] you'd take complete control.
[25:03] each song that'll be sung, [music] each
[25:05] worshiper. Lord, may our adoration,
[25:08] Lord, our hearts be in tune with what
[25:11] you desire [music] to minister tonight
[25:13] as you certainly prepared the man of
[25:15] God, Brother [music] Timothy. And Lord,
[25:18] you've given him a word in due season
[25:19] that he could come and speak exactly
[25:22] what we have need of.
[25:25] God, there's those that [music] are out
[25:27] on the streaming congregation tonight.
[25:29] Maybe you'll hear this service in the
[25:32] days ahead. May you speak [music] Lord
[25:35] as only you can do Lord.
[25:39] [music] Trans
[25:41] time doesn't matter to you. The
[25:43] distances, the miles don't have any
[25:46] effect on your word [music]
[25:48] for we know it's true. It's yay and
[25:50] amen. It's come to deliver your people.
[25:54] Tonight we want to lay ourselves aside.
[25:58] just sit at [music] your feet as it were
[26:00] to hear the precious words proceed.
[26:07] Just
[26:08] &gt;&gt; [music]
[26:08] &gt;&gt; lay ourselves humbly at your feet
[26:09] tonight, Lord. Many needs were read
[26:12] across the desk, Lord. Many urgent
[26:15] requests, those that have just come out
[26:17] of [music] surgery tonight, those that
[26:20] are looking to have a surgery tomorrow.
[26:24] Guide the hand of the physician, Lord.
[26:28] How many testimonies [music]
[26:29] have come in where we've heard that just
[26:32] at the last moment?
[26:35] You caused [music] something special to
[26:36] happen in that room.
[26:39] Lord, it's only something that you can
[26:40] do. We're depending upon [music] you.
[26:45] We love you tonight. How many would just
[26:47] lift your hands and say, "Lord, I love
[26:49] you."
[26:54] The children are [music] here reporting
[26:55] for duty.
[26:57] those that can't make it, we certainly
[26:59] want to hold them up in prayer tonight,
[27:00] [music]
[27:01] thinking of Brother Jonathan, Lord, and
[27:03] the asthma condition that keeps
[27:05] afflicting him. We know what the prophet
[27:07] [music] said about asthma. Just pray
[27:10] that you'd deliver Brother Jonathan
[27:12] tonight. [music] Your mighty hand be
[27:15] shown powerful once again.
[27:19] Lord, as the tithes [music] and the
[27:21] offerings receive tonight, we pray that
[27:24] you bless it, multiply it, bless the
[27:26] giver tonight, we pray, committing the
[27:29] service to you and all things [music] in
[27:31] Jesus name.
[27:33] Amen. And amen.
[27:40] Amen. If the brothers wouldn't [music]
[27:41] mind receiving the offering tonight.
[27:45] I give myself away.

[32:38] can [music] use me. I give myself
[32:42] [singing]
[32:43] away.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Give myself away. [singing]
[32:49] [music]
[32:49] &gt;&gt; I give myself away
[32:53] so you [music and singing]
[32:55] can use me.
[32:59] God bless you as you have your seats
[33:01] tonight.
[33:05] Keep us.
[33:08] You unravel me [singing and music]
[33:11] with a meloy.
[33:14] You surround [singing]
[33:15] [music] me with
[33:18] a song [music]
[33:22] of deliverance
[33:26] from my [music and singing] enies
[33:31] till all my fears
[33:34] are gone. [music] Let's sing that again.
[33:38] You [singing] unround me
[33:42] with [music] the melo.
[33:46] You surround [singing] me with [music]
[33:50] the song.
[33:54] a deliverer [music]
[33:58] from [singing] my enemies
[34:03] till all [singing and music]
[34:04] my fears
[34:06] are gone.
[34:10] And I'm no longer
[34:13] a slave
[34:14] to fear.
[34:16] [music and singing]
[34:19] I am
[34:21] a child
[34:22] of God.

[35:06] Your [music] blood flows through
[35:09] [singing]
[35:10] my veins.
[35:13] [music]
[35:14] I'm no [singing] longer
[35:16] a slave
[35:18] to [music] me.
[35:22] I am [music and singing]
[35:24] the child
[35:26] of God
[35:30] and I'm [singing] no longer
[35:33] a slave [music]
[35:34] to fear.
[35:38] I am [singing]
[35:40] [music] a child
[35:42] of God.
[35:45] [music]
[35:53] &gt;&gt; [music]
[35:54] &gt;&gt; I want to sing that next verse.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; You split the seas so I [singing] could
[36:00] walk right [music] through. Do
[36:04] &gt;&gt; you feel like that tonight? [singing]
[36:08] [music]
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's that kind of God. [singing] You
[36:11] rescued me. resue me so I can [music]
[36:16] say and I
[36:20] [singing] am
[36:22] a child
[36:24] of God. [music]
[36:29] You split [music] the sea so I could
[36:32] walk right [singing] through it. [music]
[36:36] My fears are drown in perfect [singing]
[36:40] love.
[36:44] You rescue [music]
[36:46] me so I can see [singing]
[36:49] and see. [music]
[36:51] I am [singing] a child.
[36:55] Oh again.
[36:57] [music]
[37:00] You [singing]
[37:01] the sea so I could [music] walk right
[37:05] through it.
[37:08] My fears [music and singing] are drown
[37:10] in perfect love.
[37:13] [music]
[37:16] You resueed me so I can stand [music]
[37:20] and say
[37:22] I am
[37:24] a child
[37:26] of God. I'm no longer I'm no
[37:31] [singing and music] longer
[37:32] a slave
[37:34] to fear. [singing]
[37:38] I am [music]
[37:40] a child [singing]
[37:42] of God.
[37:46] I'm no [music and singing] longer
[37:48] a slave
[37:50] to fear.
[37:54] I am a child
[37:58] of God. [music]
[38:02] King, I believe that you're my healer.
[38:08] I believe that you're [singing] my heer.
[38:13] [music]
[38:15] I believe
[38:18] you're [singing] more than enough
[38:19] [music]
[38:20] for me.
[38:26] Jesus, you're all I [singing] need.
[38:30] [music]
[38:35] I believe [singing and music]
[38:38] you're my
[38:43] I believe [singing and music]
[38:46] you are all [singing]

[39:03] [music]
[39:06] I
[39:09] [music]
[39:12] [singing]
[39:17] Jesus [music]
[39:18] you're all I
[39:22] The first verse, you [music and singing]
[39:24] hold my
[39:31] Thank you. You [music] are [singing] my
[39:36] &gt;&gt; You walk with [music] me.
[39:39] You walk [singing]
[39:41] with me
[39:43] through fire [music]
[39:46] and you [singing] give my
[39:50] [music]
[39:53] [singing]
[39:54] I trust
[39:57] [music]
[40:02] Lord. Heat.
[40:06] [music]
[40:11] Heat.
[40:14] [music]
[40:19] [singing]
[40:21] [music] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[40:26] [music]
[40:31] Oh, [singing]
[40:33] I believe [music]
[40:35] I
[40:39] [music and singing]
[40:45] more [music] than enough for me.
[40:51] [music]
[40:53] Jesus, [singing]
[40:54] you're all I need. [music]
[40:59] Sing the first. You hold my heaven.
[41:02] [singing and music]
[41:08] You [music and singing] are my
[41:13] You walk with me.
[41:16] You [music and singing] are with me
[41:19] through fire
[41:23] [music] and you feel mighty. [singing]
[41:29] [music]
[41:31] Oh my I [singing]
[41:42] [music]
[41:47] [singing]
[41:48] [music]
[41:51] [singing] might
[41:54] Oh I [music] might
[41:59] you [singing]
[42:00] are.
[42:04] Oh, I believe.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; I believe. [music and singing]
[42:08] &gt;&gt; I believe.
[42:11] I believe
[42:14] you're [music]
[42:15] my portion.
[42:19] I believe [singing]
[42:21] you're [music] more than
[42:26] [singing]
[42:28] [music]
[42:30] Jesus. You are all
[42:34] [music]
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many believe in him
[42:39] [music] tonight?
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Can't believe in anything else, but we
[42:42] can believe in our Jesus. Amen. [music]
[42:45] He's all that we need. Amen. Let's just
[42:47] go to him in prayer. Father, come to you
[42:50] tonight, Lord, once again, [music] just
[42:52] to bow our hearts before you, Lord, and
[42:54] just say how much we're thankful to
[42:56] [music] be able to serve you in this
[42:57] time that we're living in, Lord. This
[43:00] world is just seems to be in chaos all
[43:03] around us and things happening very
[43:06] quickly as we see prophecies being
[43:08] fulfilled [music] and
[43:10] Lord we're we got our eyes on you and
[43:12] we're looking for your appearing Lord
[43:15] just any day now the dead in Christ to
[43:17] arise [music]
[43:18] we to be changed Lord in a moment and
[43:20] twinkling of an eye God what a day
[43:22] that'll be [music] I believe I believe
[43:25] what you said and I believe you will do
[43:27] what you said and I just commit Lord,
[43:30] [music] this service to you, Lord, you
[43:31] see all the ones that are here that
[43:33] you've gathered here tonight, different
[43:35] ones, visitors, local folks, [music]
[43:37] everyone. Father, we just come together
[43:39] and put our licks of fire together,
[43:42] Lord, just to [music]
[43:43] have fellowship with you and with each
[43:45] other. We thank you for this opportunity
[43:47] in Jesus name. Amen.
[43:51] Amen. [music] You turn to Markap 11 and
[43:53] verse 22.
[43:56] [clears throat]
[43:58] like to speak to you this evening on the
[44:00] language of faith or faith vocabulary,
[44:04] however you would like to title it. But
[44:06] Markap 11 and verse 22, it said, "And
[44:09] Jesus answered, saith unto them, have
[44:11] faith in God, for verily I say unto you,
[44:14] that whosoever shall say unto this
[44:16] mountain, be thou removed, and be thou
[44:19] cast into the sea, and shall not doubt
[44:22] in his heart, but shall believe, that
[44:24] those things which he saith shall come
[44:26] to pass, he shall have whatsoever he
[44:29] saith. Therefore, I say unto you,
[44:32] whatsoever ye desire when you pray,
[44:36] believe that ye receive them, and ye
[44:38] shall have them. Amen. God bless. You
[44:41] can be seated.
[44:43] [clears throat]
[44:46] I think it's very
[44:49] uh something that we should take note of
[44:52] that Jesus didn't say, you know, for us
[44:55] to go get somebody else and speak or to
[44:58] get a preacher and have him speak or or
[45:01] get a prophet and have him speak or even
[45:03] Jesus himself speak. But he said that
[45:06] whosoever shall say to this mountain, be
[45:09] thou removed, and be thou cast into the
[45:11] sea, and shall not doubt in his heart,
[45:14] he shall believe that those things which
[45:16] he said,
[45:18] &gt;&gt; which he said. How many he or she's are
[45:20] here today. Amen. He say shall come to
[45:22] pass, and he shall have whatsoever he
[45:25] saith. So in our scripture reading,
[45:27] Jesus is letting us know that words
[45:30] spoken in faith have power. Amen. What
[45:33] we say matters. And how we say it
[45:36] matters. We either are going to speak in
[45:38] doubt or we're going to speak in faith.
[45:40] One or the other controls us. Amen. You
[45:42] know when spa when faith speaks, it
[45:45] speaks in tones of trust. Trust. Lord, I
[45:48] believe. Or it speaks of of expectation.
[45:52] God will provide. It it speaks of
[45:54] surrender. Not my will but your will be
[45:57] done. It speaks of praise. Amen. Great
[46:00] is thy faithfulness. Even when I don't
[46:03] see it happening, I still believe. Amen.
[46:06] Faith look will look at a storm and
[46:08] it'll start praising the God who calms a
[46:11] storm. Amen. Unbelief, you know, also
[46:13] has a language, you know, when unbelief
[46:15] speaks. It says, "Hath God really said?"
[46:18] We heard, Amen, the serpent in the
[46:20] Bible, we can read in Genesis 3 and
[46:22] verse one. This is where he interjected
[46:24] unbelief into the words of uh uh into
[46:27] the into the thoughts of man. Hath God
[46:29] really said? In Psalm 78 it says, "Can
[46:32] God furnish?" So this has has God really
[46:35] says or can God or you know and then and
[46:38] brings it on down to us in Numbers
[46:40] chapter 13. We can't. It's impossible.
[46:43] Amen. That's what the spies said as they
[46:45] would look into the land. It's
[46:47] impossible. We're not able to go up. You
[46:50] know, when they said that, they said,
[46:51] "We can't do it. We We can't have We We
[46:54] can't We can't take the land. We can't
[46:56] have our own revival. Everything's
[46:58] against us. The Amorites are there. The
[47:00] Hittites are there. The The Jericho is
[47:03] walled up. We look like grasshoppers."
[47:05] But Joshua and Caleb, they refused to
[47:08] speak the language of unbelief.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; They refused to speak what was what was
[47:13] coming out of the other 10 spies mouth.
[47:15] And and then Caleb would say, "You know
[47:16] what? We're more than able to take it."
[47:19] Amen. They begin to speak the language
[47:21] of faith and and they begin to speak NOT
[47:23] NOT NOT GOD is able, we are able.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's already given it to us.
[47:29] God's already promised it to us. So, it
[47:31] only takes us, amen, to grab a hold of
[47:33] the the language of faith and begin to
[47:36] speak and to speak faith over what God
[47:38] has already given us. And what God has
[47:41] said, God settles it. Amen. So,
[47:43] therefore, we can have healings. We can
[47:47] have miracles. We can have revivals. We
[47:50] can have blessings. Why? Because God
[47:52] said so. And if I take the spirit of
[47:54] faith and the language of faith and I
[47:56] begin to speak it, amen, we can HAVE A
[47:59] TRUE PENTECOST. We can have a true
[48:02] individual revival. We can HAVE IT. WHY?
[48:05] GOD SAID SO. AND GOD keeps his promises.
[48:08] But you know, unbelief will come back
[48:10] around and say, "Well, unless I see
[48:12] something, then I will not. Then I will
[48:14] believe." That's what Thomas would say.
[48:16] unless I see the scars or if I see what
[48:18] you know what's really happened then I
[48:20] will believe. But that's that's the
[48:22] language of of unbelief. But faith
[48:24] that's not its language. Faith says no
[48:26] matter if I cannot see if I cannot see
[48:29] one little grain of sand moving off of
[48:31] that mountain, I'm still going to speak
[48:33] the word of God. I'm still going to say
[48:35] what God said. So fear instead of faith,
[48:38] amen, is seeing circumstances instead of
[48:41] promises. When you have faith and
[48:43] unbelief begins to speak, you're seeing
[48:45] circumstances instead of promises.
[48:48] You're you're complaining instead of
[48:50] gratitude.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're focused on your lack
[48:55] instead of what God has provided.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you have pride instead of
[49:00] humility. THEREFORE, YOU TRUST YOURSELF
[49:03] INSTEAD OF THE WORD of God. And finally,
[49:05] rebellion over obedience. You refuse,
[49:08] Amen, the word of God. and you lean upon
[49:10] your own understanding.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; This is what takes people out of the
[49:16] house of God. This is what takes people,
[49:18] Amen, away from God as they begin to
[49:20] speak the language of unbelief. Amen.
[49:23] They begin to speak the vocabulary
[49:24] unbelief. I'm a nobody. I'm a no I'm no
[49:27] good. I I'm a I'm I'm I'm a I'm lost. I
[49:30] I'm unsavable. I There's no hope for me.
[49:33] Listen, you're not lost. You're not
[49:34] unsavable. The very amazing part about
[49:37] it tonight that you would even have a
[49:38] desire to be here. It proves the very
[49:41] point that you are not unsavable. Amen.
[49:44] BUT THERE'S STILL SOMETHING ON THE
[49:45] INSIDE OF YOU. NO MATTER how far you
[49:47] went, no matter how far you've gone,
[49:49] AMEN. NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU SPOKE THE
[49:51] LANGUAGE OF UNBELIEF, THERE'S SOMETHING
[49:53] ON THE INSIDE OF YOU THAT CAN CHANGE
[49:55] YOUR LANGUAGE.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; IT CAN CHANGE YOUR THOUGHTS. IT CAN
[49:59] CHANGE YOUR THINKING. IT CAN CHANGE YOU
[50:01] FROM I'M LOST TO I'M SAVED.
[50:05] AMEN. So faith has a voice and unbelief
[50:08] has a voice.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Faith is voice is trusting. Unbelief's
[50:12] voice is doubting. Faith's voice is
[50:15] thankful. Unbelief's voice is
[50:17] complaining. Amen. Faith's voice is
[50:19] hopeful. Amen. Unbelief's voice is
[50:21] fearful. Faith's voice is obedient.
[50:24] Unbelief's voice IS RESISTANT. FAITH
[50:27] VOICE IS FOCUSED ON GOD. UNBELIEF'S
[50:29] voice is focused ON YOURSELF OR YOUR
[50:32] CIRCUMSTANCES. FAITH'S VOICE IS
[50:34] PEACEFUL. UNBELIEF'S VOICE IS ANXIOUS.
[50:37] AMEN. FAITH'S VOICE IS CONFIDENT IN THE
[50:39] PROMISE. UNBELIEF'S VOICE IS CONTROLLED
[50:42] BY SIGHT. FAITH VOICE IS WORSHIP. AMEN.
[50:45] AN unbelief for voice is worrisome.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So speaking unbelief produces
[50:52] something. It produces something in your
[50:54] life. It produces doubt which produces
[50:57] instability. It produces fear which
[50:59] produces anxiety which brings
[51:02] disobedience which brings a hardened
[51:04] heart which it brings spiritual
[51:06] blindness. It all comes from what comes
[51:09] out of your mouth.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; This is what the Bible said. Proverbs
[51:13] said, "Amen. Life and DEATH IS IN THE
[51:16] power of the tongue." IT'S VERY
[51:17] IMPORTANT WHAT HOW YOU SPEAK. AMEN.
[51:20] ABOUT YOURSELF. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT HOW
[51:22] YOU SPEAK ABOUT OTHERS. IT'S VERY
[51:24] IMPORTANT WHAT YOU SPEAK ABOUT GOD. IT'S
[51:26] VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE WATCH WHAT COMES
[51:28] OUT OF OUR MOUTH.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. So the but the words that
[51:34] are spoken faith, if you speak them in
[51:36] faith, this word word spoken faith
[51:38] actually created the whole universe.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; So faith is a creative language.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; It's a creative language. Amen. It
[51:47] creates atmospheres. When God said, "Let
[51:50] there be light," there was light. So the
[51:52] very first words and scriptures are
[51:55] spoken in faith.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD SPOKE THESE things into
[51:59] existence showing that faith language
[52:02] creates before it sees.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham talked
[52:07] about. He said you put a well body
[52:09] before YOU AND YOU WALK towards it.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; How you walk towards it. Amen. You don't
[52:13] just take these two legs and walk
[52:15] TOWARDS THEM. NO, IT'S BY FAITH.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And speaking faith, I AM HEALED.
[52:21] WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT? CUZ HIS WORD
[52:23] SAYS I'M HEALED.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I AM DELIVERED. WHY ARE YOU SAYING
[52:27] THAT? BECAUSE HIS WORD SAYS I'M
[52:28] DELIVERED.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; I AM SAVED. HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?
[52:31] BECAUSE HIS WORD SAYS I'M SAVED.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; So faith doesn't wait for evidence.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; It speaks with authority that's rooted
[52:44] in trust in God. What God says God will
[52:47] do.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's just as simple. You know,
[52:50] Brother Brham said it like this. He said
[52:52] just as simple as trying to hide behind
[52:53] some kind of church doctrine. Instead of
[52:56] just coming out and saying you don't
[52:58] have no faith, just say it. If you don't
[52:59] have faith, just say, he said, just go
[53:01] ahead and admit I don't have faith. Cuz
[53:03] he says, Satan never received the Holy
[53:05] Ghost. He ain't got nothing to give you
[53:06] faith. It's God that's got the faith.
[53:09] When you're filled with God, you're
[53:11] filled with faith.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you're not, IF YOU'RE THE
[53:16] SON OF GOD, YOU'RE LIKE GOD. SO HE
[53:18] SPEAKS THE WORD AND IT CREATES ITSELF.
[53:21] HIS WORD THE CREATIVE POWER. HOW'S THE
[53:24] WORLD COME HERE? HE MADE IT OUT OF
[53:26] THINGS WHICH ARE NOT.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; I know I know science wants to tell us
[53:31] that two particle where them two
[53:32] particles come from.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; I mean all of a sudden out in the space
[53:37] of nothingness met and boom we had a big
[53:40] bang. Yeah there was a big bang. All
[53:41] right. It was let there be.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. AND THE BANG WENT FORTH OUT OF THE
[53:47] MOUTH OF God and his word spoken. He had
[53:49] faith THAT WHAT HE SAID was going to
[53:51] come to pass.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; So he put it to test already. So when he
[53:55] gives it to you, he says, "You speak the
[53:57] word.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; YOU SPEAK TO THE MOUNTAIN and see what
[54:00] happens. YOU SAY YOUR MOUNTAIN'S GOT TO
[54:02] HEAR YOUR VOICE."
[54:04] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH JUST TO HEAR THE
[54:05] VOICE. I KNOW WE GET IN THIS IDEA, WELL,
[54:07] IF I CAN JUST get a preacher to say
[54:09] SOMETHING OVER ME. IF I CAN JUST GET him
[54:11] to do this. IT AIN'T ABOUT A PREACHER.
[54:13] IT'S ABOUT YOU BELIEVING WHAT GOD SAID
[54:16] AND PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH AND SPEAK IT
[54:18] AND WATCH THE RESULTS HAPPEN.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He said, "Let there be." Here it
[54:25] is. He believed his own word. Abraham
[54:28] had obedient faith. God spoke to Abraham
[54:30] and said, "I want you to sojourn in a
[54:32] foreign land." Amen. What did Abraham
[54:34] say? Well, let me let me let me look
[54:36] make sure I got provisions. Make sure I
[54:38] I got the money. I He didn't said he he
[54:40] JUST SAID, "I WILL GO."
[54:42] AND HE STARTED FOLLOWING AND HE LEFT
[54:45] EVERYTHING FAMILIAR AND HE WAS GUIDED
[54:47] ONLY BY WHAT GOD SAID BY GOD'S PROMISES.
[54:50] HE DIDN'T ASK FOR A MAP. HE RESPONDED
[54:53] WHEN GOD MOVED, HE MOVED.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; So the language of faith says, "I will
[55:01] go even when the destination is not
[55:04] seen."
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Did you hear that?
[55:09] &gt;&gt; I know we want to see things happen. You
[55:11] know, we're so bound by these natural
[55:13] senses that we got to see it before I
[55:15] believe it.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But that's not how it works. Not
[55:18] with faith, not with God.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's things happening in the
[55:22] realms of this building that we can't
[55:24] see with our natural eyes.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; There's there's radio radio waves and TV
[55:30] waves that are running through this
[55:31] building. You can't see them. That's
[55:32] right. But if you have a right the right
[55:35] equipment, you can pick it up and bring
[55:36] it right into right to where you can see
[55:39] what is happening in the unseen world.
[55:41] Amen. Well, if that can happen in the
[55:43] natural sense AND WE BECOME SO COMMON TO
[55:45] US THAT WE DON'T THINK NOTHING ABOUT
[55:46] turning a radio on or turning a t a TV
[55:49] screen ON OR WHATEVER AND we see a
[55:51] picture and we don't think that's a
[55:52] supernatural thing.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; It didn't happen hundreds of years ago.
[55:56] WE ARE LIVING IN A SUPERNATURAL TIME.
[55:59] Come on, somebody. Amen. where you can
[56:01] JUST TURN A DEVICE ON AND IT PICKS UP AN
[56:03] UNSEEN THING AND BRINGS IT BEFORE YOUR
[56:05] EYES. WELL, LET ME TELL YOU, IF YOU
[56:06] COULD DO THAT WITH A NATURAL THING,
[56:09] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THERE'S SPIRITUAL
[56:11] THINGS THAT ARE HAPPEN ALSO, THERE'S
[56:13] ANGELS OF FIRE THAT ARE MOVING AROUND
[56:15] THIS BUILDING AND IF GOD CAN GET A
[56:17] RECEIVING STATION HERE IN THIS BUILDING,
[56:19] HE CAN TUNE YOU IN TO SEE, HEY, THERE'S
[56:22] MORE THAN WHAT I CAN SEE WITH MY
[56:23] [screaming] EYES GOING ON. THERE'S MORE
[56:25] FOR ME THAN THERE IS AGAINST ME.
[56:28] AMEN.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. This is what Rebecca responded
[56:32] with when she came and she found I
[56:34] eleaser at the well and Eleazar was pray
[56:37] just made the prayer God who whatever
[56:39] damsel would say yes yes I'll give you a
[56:42] drink but I also water your camel and
[56:44] let let her be the one. Here comes this
[56:46] little girl and she comes this young
[56:48] lady. She comes walking down to a well
[56:50] and and he asked for a drink. She said,
[56:51] "Well, I'll not only give you a drink
[56:53] but I'll also water your camel." That
[56:54] was a big thing.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; It wasn't an easy task. Amen. to give
[56:58] all them. There was a lot of trips down
[57:00] in that well and a lot of lot of bucket
[57:02] hauling. But listen, there was SOMETHING
[57:04] ON THE INSIDE of her that made her
[57:06] respond. AND SHE SPOKE NOT DOUBT. SHE
[57:08] SPOKE FAITH.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Even when she didn't see the destination
[57:12] clearly, she didn't SEE SHE HAD NEVER
[57:14] MET ISAAC. SHE SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM.
[57:17] She didn't see a picture. She didn't get
[57:18] a facetime. SHE DIDN'T GET NONE OF THAT.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; BUT SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF HER, THEY
[57:24] SAID, "WELL, LET'S ASK HER AND SEE WHAT
[57:25] SHE WOULD DO." SHE'S RESPONDED, "I WILL
[57:27] [screaming] GO."
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's no different than one of
[57:34] you OR TO MANY OF YOU THAT CAME TO THE
[57:36] LORD AT AN ALTAR SOMEWHERE. THERE WAS
[57:38] SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE AND THE CHOICE
[57:41] WAS GIVEN AND SAID, "WILL YOU GO?" THERE
[57:43] WAS SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE THAT PUSHED
[57:45] PAST ALL THAT DOUBT, PUSHED PAST ALL
[57:48] THAT SIN THAT THE DEVIL TRIED TO COVER
[57:50] YOU UP WITH AND SAID, "I WILL
[57:52] [screaming] GO.
[57:54] [applause]
[57:57] Faith has a language.
[58:02] [snorts]
[58:02] &gt;&gt; When Rebecca was asked if she would go,
[58:04] she she chose faith. Not not well, let
[58:07] me let me check this out. How many how
[58:09] many cows does he own? How, you know,
[58:11] does he have a good house? Well, what's
[58:14] he got? You know, is he good-look?
[58:17] She had asked none of that. She'd have
[58:19] responded in faith.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You [snorts] know, Daniel and his
[58:24] friends Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[58:26] they spoke courage in the face of a
[58:28] fire.
[58:30] Their faith did not depend on the
[58:32] outcome. Their faith depended on their
[58:35] God.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Even if he does not save us, we want you
[58:39] to know Cain will not serve your gods.
[58:42] So, it wasn't dependent on the outcome.
[58:45] Well, I'll have faith if I got a good
[58:46] outcome. That's not faith.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Faith is believing no matter what the
[58:50] outcome is.
[58:52] Amen. Faith speaks defiance to fear and
[58:55] devotion beyond deliverance. It is not
[58:57] worried about what is going to happen in
[58:59] the future. It only SPEAKS THE WORD OF
[59:01] GOD.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. So this is where Mary Mary when
[59:05] she's walking down to the well she said
[59:07] the angel appears to her and says bold a
[59:11] hands MADE OF THE LORD HIGHLY FAVORED
[59:13] AND SHE LOOKS AND SHE HEARS ALL the
[59:14] what's going to happen. WHAT WAS HER
[59:16] RESPONSE? WELL LET ME SEE how can this I
[59:19] don't know. I don't know if I can DO IT.
[59:20] NO, BE IT UNTO ME.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A LANGUAGE OF FAITH. SO
[59:25] FAITH'S WORDS ARE YES, LORD.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; THEY RESPOND WITH A YES. AND THROUGH
[59:31] THAT SURRENDER, IT'LL MAKE WAY FOR A
[59:33] MIRACLE.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Come on. Did you catch it? When you say
[59:38] yes, that's a time the gates are open
[59:40] for a miracle. When you begin to SPEAK
[59:43] THE WORD OF GOD, IT OPENS UP THE
[59:45] POSSIBILITY FOR A MIRACLE TO TAKE PLACE
[59:47] IN YOUR LIFE. WHEN YOU BEGIN TO RESPOND
[59:50] WITH, "YES, LORD, I WILL GO. YES, I'LL
[59:52] LAY ASIDE MY SINS. YES, I'LL LAY ASIDE
[59:55] MY UNBELIEF. YES, I WILL WALK WITH YOU.
[59:57] I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU LEAD, I WILL
[1:00:00] FOLLOW."
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; YES, LORD. It'll open up the possibility
[1:00:05] of a miracle for you.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; But so many people, you know, they ask
[1:00:09] God to move and they don't really expect
[1:00:10] God to do it some reason. Well, you
[1:00:13] know, but when you ask God to move,
[1:00:14] expect God to move.
[1:00:18] Don't wait to see if he will. Prepare
[1:00:20] for him to arrive.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's faith.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. PREPARE FOR HIM TO MOVE. PREPARE
[1:00:30] FOR HIM TO SUPPLY. IF YOU HAVE A NEED,
[1:00:32] YOU ASK GOD, I HAVE A NEED. WELL,
[1:00:34] PREPARE FOR HIM TO SUPPLY THE NEED.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. IF YOU'RE SICK AND
[1:00:41] YOU SAY, GOD, I NEED A HEALING. WE'LL
[1:00:43] PREPARE FOR HIM TO HEAL YOU. AMEN.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. HOW? WHY? I DON'T
[1:00:48] KNOW WHY. WHY? CUZ HIS WORD SAID SO.
[1:00:51] THAT'S WHY.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; When you ask God for a new home, start
[1:00:56] packing up your boxes.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. Position yourself in a place to
[1:01:03] move with him. Be ready and expectant.
[1:01:05] Don't sit back and see if God's if God's
[1:01:08] word's going to come to pass. Start
[1:01:10] expecting it to come to pass.
[1:01:13] You know like like the people years ago
[1:01:16] gathered in the church to pray for rain.
[1:01:18] The crops were burning up. Severe
[1:01:20] drought was happening. One [snorts] man
[1:01:23] became convinced that God heard their
[1:01:25] prayers. So you know what he did? He
[1:01:28] went outside and took his saddle off his
[1:01:30] horse and put it up somewhere where it
[1:01:31] wouldn't get wet.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; He was preparing for God to answer his
[1:01:38] prayer.
[1:01:41] Well, I'll wait till my saddle gets wet
[1:01:42] before I take. No, you prepare for God
[1:01:45] to move.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Prepare for him to answer. You know,
[1:01:48] hey, don't don't you say, "Well, I've
[1:01:50] been waiting a long time." Well, it
[1:01:52] doesn't matter. Waiting is part of the
[1:01:54] part of the seasons that you go through.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; That ain't the time to give up. That's
[1:01:59] the time to prepare.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; God, that's why he said, "He that
[1:02:02] knockketh, it shall be open. HE THAT
[1:02:05] SEEKETH, IT SHALL BE FOUND." WHAT IS IT?
[1:02:07] IT'S A PLACE OF PREPAREDNESS. IT'S NOT
[1:02:09] JUST STANDING back and twiddling your
[1:02:11] thumbs or getting on this or that and
[1:02:13] WORRIED ABOUT SOME. NO, I'M LOOKING FOR
[1:02:15] GOD TO MOVE. I'M LOOKING FOR GOD TO
[1:02:17] ANSWER. I'M LOOKING FOR GOD TO DO WHAT
[1:02:20] HE SAID HE'S GOING TO DO. THEREFORE, I'M
[1:02:23] NOT GOING TO SPEAK MY DOUBTS. I'M NOT
[1:02:24] GOING TO SPEAK MY FRUSTRATION. I'M NOT
[1:02:26] GOING TO SPEAK WHAT'S AROUND ME OR WHAT
[1:02:28] I SEE OR MY CIRCUMSTANCES. I'M NOT GOING
[1:02:30] TO SPEAK, AMEN, BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF
[1:02:32] MY PRAYERS BEING ANSWERED. I'M NOT EVEN
[1:02:34] TALKING ABOUT THAT. I'M TALKING ABOUT
[1:02:36] HIS WORD. HE SAID IT. I BELIEVE IT. HE
[1:02:40] SAID IT. IT IS DONE.
[1:02:43] [applause]
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Start preparing for rain.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; You've been asking for it. Prepare for
[1:02:50] it.
[1:02:53] [snorts]
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; There's a language of faith even in
[1:02:56] prayer. Father, I thank you that you
[1:03:00] hear me. Amen.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Well, most of our Well, I I my prayer
[1:03:06] didn't even hit the ceiling. I don't
[1:03:07] think I tell you I just cuz I am just
[1:03:09] not a worthy person. I tell you, I
[1:03:11] don't. Thank you, Lord, for you have
[1:03:13] heard my prayer.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; I know you're working even when I don't
[1:03:19] see it yet.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; YOUR EAR IS NOT DEAF. YOU DELIGHT IN THE
[1:03:24] prayers of your people.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Let your WILL BE DONE. THEREFORE, I AM
[1:03:30] TRUSTING IN YOUR TIMING.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; I know we want our timing. You know,
[1:03:37] we're we're people, we want it real
[1:03:38] quick. We ain't we ain't we ain't
[1:03:40] waiting around for nothing.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Back in the day, they didn't mind
[1:03:45] waiting. They wait. But today, we don't
[1:03:48] want to wait for nothing. We want a
[1:03:49] microwave. We want to We want We want to
[1:03:52] We We travel quick. We do everything
[1:03:54] quick. And so, when it comes to God, we
[1:03:56] want it quick. We've been programmed
[1:03:58] that way. That ain't the way God works.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; It's been 6,000 years since the fall of
[1:04:05] man. It ain't quick.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; We have We' have thought, well, man, it'
[1:04:10] be over in a few seconds. That ain't the
[1:04:12] way God works. It's cogs of prophecy
[1:04:15] grind slow, but sure,
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; but they're moving. You may not can see
[1:04:20] it sometimes. You wonder, my what's
[1:04:22] happened? Listen. And they get, you know
[1:04:23] how it gets, it gets right down every
[1:04:25] We're going way back here now,
[1:04:28] but back in the day of real to reals, I
[1:04:30] know there's a lot of people don't even
[1:04:31] know maybe. How many know what real to
[1:04:32] real is?
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Had to use have these two reel. I
[1:04:38] can still barely remember them. I'm not
[1:04:40] quite old enough to actually have used a
[1:04:41] whole lot of them, but it had these two
[1:04:44] reels. And you could watch as one get
[1:04:46] and as it getting closer to the end,
[1:04:48] this one starts spinning faster and
[1:04:49] faster and faster faster. [snorts]
[1:04:51] done.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; But it seemed like we would take it
[1:04:55] because I remember I do. Oh Lord, give
[1:04:58] myself a trouble. I do remember
[1:04:59] listening to a tape and I'd watch that
[1:05:01] reel.
[1:05:04] When ain't can I go out and play? This
[1:05:07] ain't never going to get done.
[1:05:10] And it's
[1:05:14] how in the world I got to go. I got to
[1:05:16] go. I can't.
[1:05:19] and all of a sudden
[1:05:22] done. This is exactly how the prophecies
[1:05:24] are taking place. Brother Bram talked
[1:05:26] about when Jesus was on the cross,
[1:05:28] thousands of prophecies were fulfilled
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; very quickly in just a few hours. This
[1:05:33] is exactly what's going to happen in
[1:05:34] this exodus we're in.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; It's been seemed like for 20 years, 30
[1:05:39] years, 40 years, 50, how long you been
[1:05:41] in the mess? It been moving real slow.
[1:05:43] When we going to get out of here? When
[1:05:45] we going to get out? How I don't think
[1:05:47] it's ever going to happen. All said,
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; the dead in Christ rise.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; We go to meet him in the air and it's
[1:05:55] finished.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; But we WANT IT IN OUR TIME. LISTEN, WE
[1:05:59] GOT TO TRUST GOD'S TIMING.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO TRUST HIM ON AND HIS TIMING
[1:06:04] FOR OUR FUTURE AND HIS TIMING FOR OUR
[1:06:06] MATE AND HIS TIMING FOR OUR HEALING AND
[1:06:08] HIS TIMING FOR EVERYTHING WE DO. WE HAVE
[1:06:11] TO TRUST IN GOD'S TIMING. GOD KNOWS
[1:06:13] EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME TO MOVE. AMEN.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Let your will be done. I trust your
[1:06:25] timing.
[1:06:27] So we get want to go through some
[1:06:29] scriptures
[1:06:30] to to hear about the l hear the language
[1:06:33] of faith. That's the word the language
[1:06:35] of faith. I can do all things through
[1:06:38] Christ who strengthened me. Christ
[1:06:41] strengthened me. I am able and I am not
[1:06:45] alone.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; With God all things are possible. What
[1:06:49] looks impossible to me is always
[1:06:52] possible with God.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; FOR WE WALK BY FAITH and not by sight.
[1:06:56] So even WHEN I DON'T SEE IT, I TRUST
[1:06:59] WHAT GOD has said.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; HE HE IS FAITHFUL WHO MADE THE PROMISE.
[1:07:03] GOD WILL DO WHAT HE SAID. His word does
[1:07:06] not fail.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; WHEN I'M AFRAID, I WILL TRUST YOU. FEAR
[1:07:11] MAY COME, BUT MY TRUST, MY FAITH WILL
[1:07:15] STAND FIRM IN THE TIME WHEN fear arises.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[1:07:21] Whom shall I fear? In other words,
[1:07:24] darkness cannot stay where his light is.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS NOT GIVEN US A SPIRIT OF FEAR,
[1:07:32] BUT OF POWER AND LOVE AND A SOUND MIND.
[1:07:35] FEAR HAS NO VOICE HERE.
[1:07:39] AMEN.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; THIS MICROPHONE HAS NO VOICE UNLESS I
[1:07:44] GIVE MY VOICE TO IT.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; SO FEAR HAS NO VOICE UNLESS YOU GIVE
[1:07:49] YOUR VOICE TO IT.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. FAITH HAS NO VOICE
[1:07:55] UNLESS YOU GIVE YOUR VOICE TO IT.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ENGLISH HAS NO VOICE. IT'S JUST
[1:08:00] ENGLISH. IT'S JUST WORDS ON A PAPER
[1:08:02] SOMEWHERE OR SO. BUT UNLESS SOMEBODY
[1:08:04] WILL BEGIN TO SPEAK IT OR SOMEBODY BEGIN
[1:08:06] TO SAY IT, IT HAS NO POWER.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my shepherd and I shall not
[1:08:18] want. Therefore, I can say my needs are
[1:08:21] met.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; My shepherd provides.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; My God shall supply all your needs
[1:08:27] according his riches and glory. He
[1:08:29] provides more than enough for every
[1:08:31] need.
[1:08:33] Amen. The Lord is with me. I WILL NOT BE
[1:08:35] AFRAID. GOD IS HERE WITH ME. I am not
[1:08:38] alone. I am not IN THIS BY MYSELF.
[1:08:41] THEREFORE, I HAVE NO REASON to fear.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; I will NEVER LEAVE YOU NOR FORSAKE YOU.
[1:08:48] EVEN IN SILENCE,
[1:08:50] GOD IS right there near you.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Seen something today. Somebody said
[1:08:58] said,
[1:09:00] "Well, I hadn't heard God. I can't hear
[1:09:02] God's voice. I He said it says something
[1:09:05] along these lines. Says, "Normally, when
[1:09:07] somebody's right next to you, they're
[1:09:08] not hollering."
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; He promised he would never leave us or
[1:09:15] forsake us.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; You are not alone.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Even in his silence, seems like I
[1:09:22] haven't heard. God is still there.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; He's still right. Don't let the devil
[1:09:27] talk you into that. Well, God's left
[1:09:28] you. God doesn't care about you. God
[1:09:30] doesn't know about you. God doesn't He's
[1:09:32] not interested in you. He's not. No,
[1:09:33] God's right there.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; He promised he would never leave us or
[1:09:37] FORSAKE YOU. BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM
[1:09:39] GOD. I WILL REST IN HIS POWER AND HIS
[1:09:42] PEACE. NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST YOU
[1:09:45] SHALL PROSPER.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; This is the LANGUAGE OF FAITH. NO, NO
[1:09:50] WEAPON FORMED AGAINST YOU SHALL PROSPER.
[1:09:52] WHAT COMES AGAINST ME CANNOT OVERCOME
[1:09:55] ME.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS
[1:10:00] THROUGH HIM WHO LOVED US. THROUGH HIS
[1:10:02] LOVE, I WIN. NOT BY MIGHT, BUT BY GRACE.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; NOT BY what I CAN DO, BUT WHAT HE'S
[1:10:08] ALREADY DONE.
[1:10:14] [snorts]
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; This is the victory that has overcome
[1:10:16] the world. Our faith.
[1:10:18] Therefore, my faith is not fragile.
[1:10:22] It is victorious.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:28] I might need to say that one more time
[1:10:30] again. My faith is not fragile.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; It is victorious.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; So you speak faith even when you don't
[1:10:41] feel worthy.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Cuz you you go by feelings. My goodness,
[1:10:47] you probably never speak faith.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Because a lot of But your feelings a lie
[1:10:52] to you. Amen.
[1:10:54] [snorts]
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me cuz you can get all kind
[1:10:56] of symptoms that'll sure enough lie to
[1:10:58] you.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm having a heart attack or I'm
[1:11:02] having this or I'm having that. And it's
[1:11:04] just an ache in the muscle. It's a nerve
[1:11:05] pitch. But your symptoms will try to
[1:11:07] convince you that you're having a heart
[1:11:08] attack.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; It'll lie to you. And it's just the same
[1:11:12] not just in the body, but also in the
[1:11:14] emotional realms. things will happen and
[1:11:15] your symptoms your symptoms will begin
[1:11:17] to lie to you and begin to build up
[1:11:19] things in you and build up animosities
[1:11:21] AND BITTERNESS AND ALL KIND OF THINGS
[1:11:23] THAT ARE HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S TRYING TO
[1:11:25] STOP YOU FROM SPEAKING faith
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; so even when I don't feel worthy I can
[1:11:33] still speak the word of God
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; because why it's not dependent on my
[1:11:37] worth and this is dependent on him what
[1:11:38] he said in 1 John 4 and 10 herein is
[1:11:41] love not that we love God but that he
[1:11:44] loves me or loves us.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, HALLELUJAH. IT ISN'T BECAUSE I LOVED
[1:11:49] HIM. IT'S BECAUSE HE LOVED ME.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad about that? Even when
[1:11:55] you didn't love him, even when you
[1:11:57] didn't even think ABOUT HIM, HE WAS FAR
[1:11:59] AWAY FROM YOU, GOD STILL LOVES YOU.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; And he sent his son to be a perpetuation
[1:12:07] for our sins. said in Ephesians 1 and
[1:12:10] verse4 through 6, according as he has
[1:12:12] chosen us in him before the foundation
[1:12:14] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:12:17] without blame before him in love, having
[1:12:19] predestinated us in the adoption of
[1:12:21] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:12:23] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:12:25] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:12:27] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:12:30] in the beloved. So it's not me if I'm
[1:12:34] worthy, it's him. He's worthy.
[1:12:37] So faith vocabulary speaks I have been
[1:12:40] made worthy. I have been made accepted.
[1:12:44] I AM CHOSEN. I AM HIS. I BELONG TO
[1:12:47] JESUS.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I FEEL LIKE. IT'S
[1:12:52] MATTER WHAT HIS WORD SAYS.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; So we're to have faith and believe. And
[1:13:00] if you're ordained to eternal life,
[1:13:01] Jesus said, "No man can come to me
[1:13:03] anyhow except the father draw him."
[1:13:05] That's right. And if you're ordained to
[1:13:07] eternal life to see and believe, you
[1:13:09] will.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how much the devil
[1:13:15] tries to pour over the top of you, just
[1:13:17] like concrete over a seed of grass. But
[1:13:19] if that grass is ordained to life, it's
[1:13:21] going to come to life.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how much concrete you
[1:13:24] put over, how much rock you try to crush
[1:13:26] it with. It does not matter. If it's
[1:13:28] ordained to life, it's going to come to
[1:13:30] life. And if you are ordained TO ETERNAL
[1:13:33] LIFE, THERE AIN'T ENOUGH DEVILS TO KEEP
[1:13:34] YOU FROM IT.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; THERE AIN'T ENOUGH SIN THAT HE CAN PUT
[1:13:38] OVER YOUR LIFE. ENOUGH MUCK OF THE WORLD
[1:13:40] THAT HE CAN COVER YOU WITH. IF GOD HAS
[1:13:42] PUT A SEED ON THE INSIDE OF YOU, IT'S
[1:13:45] GOING TO COME TO LIFE.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's a drawing power that is
[1:13:52] greater than the sin that holds you.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; If you're ordained to eternal life to
[1:13:59] see and believe, you will. if you want.
[1:14:01] If you're not, it's like pouring water
[1:14:03] on a duck's back. It'll do no good at
[1:14:05] all. No matter how much you try to
[1:14:06] explain it, those who God has chosen
[1:14:09] before the foundation of the world, if
[1:14:10] you're chosen God, you were not chosen
[1:14:13] here, you were chosen before the world
[1:14:16] began.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; So that tells me if I wasn't chosen
[1:14:20] here, I can't be unchosen here.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Hello. If I was not chose here, I cannot
[1:14:29] be unchos here.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; God does not change his mind.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful about that. I'm thankful
[1:14:35] he's not some fickle man that get up one
[1:14:37] day, love you one day, and hate you the
[1:14:39] next, got a problem with you one day,
[1:14:41] and putting his arms around you THE NEXT
[1:14:42] DAY. THAT'S NOT GOD. IF GOD LOVES YOU,
[1:14:44] HE'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; IF GOD CHOSE YOU, HE'LL ALWAYS CHOOSE
[1:14:49] YOU. HE WILL NOT UNCHOOSE YOU. AMEN.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; You're chosen before the world began.
[1:14:57] Therefore, faith knows no defeat.
[1:15:00] Faith is perfect. Faith brings things
[1:15:04] when there's no things to be brought.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Faith creates. Faith takes
[1:15:11] away doubt. IT TAKES AWAY NEGATIVITY. IT
[1:15:14] MAKES POSITIVE.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; SO, if you're negative tonight, you know
[1:15:19] why you're negative? because you're
[1:15:20] speaking the language of unbelief.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; If you're negative about THIS AND
[1:15:26] NEGATIVE ABOUT THAT, YOU NEED TO SAY,
[1:15:27] "GOD, [screaming] CHANGE MY VOCABULARY.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; CHANGE MY HEART SO I CAN SPEAK SOMETHING
[1:15:34] DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I'M SPEAKING NOW."
[1:15:36] CUZ LET ME TELL YOU, YOUR NEGATIVITY IS
[1:15:38] GOING TO TAKE YOU INTO MORE NEGATIVITY.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Negativity breeds MORE NEGATIVITY AND IT
[1:15:43] BREEDS MORE NEGATIVITY AND IT BREEDS
[1:15:45] MORE NEGATIVITY. BUT IF WE CAN FLIP IT
[1:15:47] AROUND TONIGHT AND YOU BEGIN TO SPEAK
[1:15:49] THE WORD OF GOD AND YOU BEGIN TO SPEAK
[1:15:51] THE POWER OF GOD AND YOU BEGIN TO SPEAK
[1:15:53] POSITIVE THINGS AND IT'S NOT JUST MADE
[1:15:55] making a motion AND SAYING SOMETHING.
[1:15:57] NO, IT'S SOMETHING COMING FROM YOUR
[1:15:59] HEART.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; I AM A SON. I AM FORGIVEN. I HAVE BEEN
[1:16:05] SET FREE. I NEVER DID BELONG TO THE
[1:16:07] DEVIL.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; GOD BROKE MY CHAINS. HE SET ME FREE. I
[1:16:13] DON'T HAVE TO BE BOUND BY ANXIETIES AND
[1:16:15] FEAR AND WORRIES OF ANY KIND. GOD HAS
[1:16:18] ALLOWED ME TO TEAR DOWN THE STRONGHOLDS.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Got to listen to that the other day.
[1:16:27] Wonderful sermon.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Probably need to listen to it every
[1:16:29] week, maybe every day till you get it.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Devil wants to get in your mind all the
[1:16:35] time. Well, if you was worthy, you
[1:16:37] wouldn't have did that.
[1:16:40] You wouldn't have did that. You wouldn't
[1:16:42] have said that. You wouldn't.
[1:16:45] No. We're going to start speaking faith.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; We're going to speak faith over our
[1:16:49] family.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Your children's heard enough negativity.
[1:16:54] Start speaking faith over them.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; The reason some children are out of
[1:16:58] church is because their parents spoke
[1:16:59] negativity over them.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; It's just the truth. Amen. And they
[1:17:03] spoke more negativity over them than the
[1:17:05] pastor can speak from the pull pit.
[1:17:07] Posit positivity from the pull pit. And
[1:17:09] let me tell you, a negative word will
[1:17:11] outweigh sometimes a thousand positive
[1:17:13] words.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, you know, that's why the
[1:17:21] devil, he he has so much power sometimes
[1:17:23] because we allow him and his negativity
[1:17:26] to rule over our lives
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; and we begin to find every we get this
[1:17:29] critical spirit. We find negative things
[1:17:31] to think about and dwell upon and all
[1:17:33] and it just keeps on as a big old ball
[1:17:35] of wax until you're so weighed down you
[1:17:37] can't even hardly lift your hands no
[1:17:38] more and away with that stuff.
[1:17:41] AWAY WITH NEGATIVITY ABOUT WHATEVER. I
[1:17:43] WANT TO START SPEAKING FAITH. I'LL SPEAK
[1:17:45] FAITH OVER MY LIFE. I'LL SPEAK FAITH
[1:17:47] OVER MY FAMILY. I'LL SPEAK FOR HEALING.
[1:17:50] I'LL SPEAK FOR JOY. I'LL SPEAK FOR
[1:17:52] HAPPINESS. I'LL SPEAK FOR PEACE.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [snorts]
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; I tell you what happened the other day.
[1:18:00] I was just I was just there at my my
[1:18:02] daughter's house there in Sarasota and a
[1:18:04] little boy, my grandson hadn't been
[1:18:06] sleeping, been up most of the night
[1:18:08] crying, just wake up screaming. I walked
[1:18:10] in that room. I said, "Devil, let me
[1:18:11] tell you something. You ain't got no
[1:18:13] right to be in this room.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; You tormenting spirit want to torment
[1:18:16] this little kid in the night. I curse
[1:18:18] you in the name of Jesus." AND I SPEAK
[1:18:20] FAITH OVER THIS ROOM THAT IT'LL BE
[1:18:22] COVERED with the ANGELS OF GOD. AND THE
[1:18:24] SCRIPTURE SAYS HE can have peaceful
[1:18:26] sleep.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE'S BEEN SLEEPING SINCE.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HAS BE TO CHANGE AND THINGS ARE
[1:18:33] HAPPENING. WHY? BECAUSE YOU BEGIN TO
[1:18:35] SPEAK FAITH.
[1:18:37] LISTEN, IF YOU'LL GO IN YOUR HOUSE AND
[1:18:39] START SPEAKING FAITH, YOU'LL START
[1:18:41] SEEING MIRACLES. YOU'LL START SEEING
[1:18:43] SIGNS AND WONDERS, YOU'LL [applause]
[1:18:44] START SEEING GOD DO THE IMPOSSIBLE.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Faith knows no defeat.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And it has to have faith has to has to
[1:18:58] have something to be based on. That's
[1:19:00] the word of God. Can't just have any
[1:19:02] kind of found. Well, if I touch a tree,
[1:19:04] I think I'll get well. No. pray to
[1:19:06] oppose. No, it's got to have a
[1:19:08] foundation. And how much more firm
[1:19:11] foundation could you place your faith on
[1:19:13] than the word of God?
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; What more could you put your faith in
[1:19:18] when he said, "Heavens and earth will
[1:19:20] pass away, but my word will never pass
[1:19:23] away then in the fact that God's word is
[1:19:27] eternal and the very world that we're
[1:19:29] sitting on tile on top of tonight is
[1:19:31] nothing more than the word of God
[1:19:33] materialized.
[1:19:35] He spoke the word and said, "Let there
[1:19:37] be." And the word came into existence.
[1:19:40] All things that you see now are made
[1:19:42] WERE MADE BY FAITH SPOKEN BY THE WORD OF
[1:19:45] GOD. GOD SAID, "LET THERE BE." And he
[1:19:47] believed his own word. Well, after
[1:19:49] redemption and and being redeemed and
[1:19:51] the taste of God in OUR SOULS AND OUR
[1:19:53] HEARTS, HOW MUCH MORE OUGHT WE TO BASE
[1:19:56] OUR FAITH ON WHAT GOD GIVE US, THE WORD
[1:19:59] OF GOD, THE PROMISES. AND HE SENT JESUS
[1:20:02] DOWN TO DIE AND REDEEM EVERY ONE OF THEM
[1:20:05] promises for us.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; So we have a right to base our faith
[1:20:09] upon the word of God.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; So if the word says it, I believe it.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Come on. If the word says it, I believe
[1:20:18] it.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. If the word says it, I believe it.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; If a politician says it, I nine times
[1:20:25] out of 10, I ain't gonna BELIEVE IT. BUT
[1:20:27] IF GOD SAID IT,
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; I CAN TAKE IT TO THE BANK. IT'S GOING TO
[1:20:31] CASH. IT'S GOING TO DO WHAT IT SAID IT'S
[1:20:33] GOING TO DO. IT'S GOING TO BRING TO
[1:20:34] FULFILLMENT WHAT IT SAID IT'S GOING TO
[1:20:36] BRING. [applause]
[1:20:37] [cheering]
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; HIS WORD SAID THINGS ABOUT OUR CHILDREN
[1:20:40] SO I CAN SPEAK FAITH OF THE WORD OF GOD
[1:20:42] OVER MY CHILDREN. I MAY NOT SEE IT
[1:20:45] HAPPENING. I MAY NOT SEE MOUNTAIN
[1:20:47] CRUMBLE AND ALL, BUT I KNOW I SPOKE THE
[1:20:49] WORD. GOD'S GOING TO BRING IT TO PASS.
[1:20:54] SO, start speaking the language of
[1:20:56] faith. Now, I've used some of these
[1:20:57] before, but I'm going to use them again.
[1:20:59] Start speaking it. I'm saved.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; I belong to God.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; I'm [snorts] forgiven. I'm redeemed. I'm
[1:21:07] justified. I'm bought. I'm purchased. MY
[1:21:10] BODY IS HIS TEMPLE. I HAVE ETERNAL LIFE.
[1:21:12] THEREFORE, I have EX ACCESS TO GOD. I'M
[1:21:15] INSEPARABLE FROM CHRIST. I AM MORE THAN
[1:21:18] A CONQUEROR.
[1:21:20] THIS IS THE LANGUAGE OF FAITH. HE WILL
[1:21:22] RENEW MY STRENGTH. I HAVE VALUE IN GOD'S
[1:21:25] EYES.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; You may not have a lot of value in your
[1:21:31] own eyes, but in God's eyes, you're of
[1:21:34] much value.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Timothy, you don't know my
[1:21:37] life and what I've been through and how
[1:21:39] wretched I am. It doesn't matter if God
[1:21:41] saw you and thought you valuable. God
[1:21:43] God sent his son and he gave his only
[1:21:45] begotten son to die on your behalf. That
[1:21:48] means you're valuable.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Except for God so loved the world that
[1:21:52] he gave his only begotten son. Listen,
[1:21:54] we want to put I heard brother Tim say
[1:21:55] it. I'm going to say it again. And we
[1:21:57] want to put it out there at the world,
[1:21:58] but we need to start putting it TO US.
[1:21:59] GOD DIED FOR ME.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; WHY DID HE DIE FOR ME? CUZ HE LOVED ME.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; WHY DOES HE LOVE ME? CUZ HE THINKS I'M
[1:22:07] SOMETHING THAT IS OF VALUE.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; NOW, the devil might not have thought
[1:22:13] you as much value because I know he
[1:22:15] don't. because he puts you in all kind
[1:22:16] of junk and tears your life apart and
[1:22:18] devalues it as much as he can possible
[1:22:21] because what he's trying to do is say
[1:22:22] look God ain't no value
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; but the value is not this flesh
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; it's that soul that's on the inside
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; the devil takes the flesh and he tries
[1:22:34] to corrupt it and bring put [snorts]
[1:22:36] smoking and drugs and sexuality sins all
[1:22:39] kinds of stuff in there cause all kind
[1:22:41] of issues but God's wanting that soul
[1:22:45] because he knows if he can get that soul
[1:22:48] that set that that soul one day and
[1:22:50] night and night to such a powerful force
[1:22:51] it'll get the body and redeem it too.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Right. But here he is
[1:22:59] so brother Timothy I just don't feel
[1:23:01] like I'm much worth much. Well you know
[1:23:04] [snorts] I've said I've used this
[1:23:05] example many times and it's something I
[1:23:07] really appreciate in the scripture that
[1:23:09] Jesus said that gives me a lot of
[1:23:11] confidence.
[1:23:13] He said, "Not even a sparrow
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; can fall to the ground
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; and the heavenly father not know about
[1:23:19] it."
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; I might have to ask my wife, how many
[1:23:25] how many variations of sparrows is
[1:23:27] there?
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; How many
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; more than 40 in the United States? And
[1:23:36] they're not thought of as a very lovely
[1:23:37] bird. Mostly a pest. And he had picked
[1:23:41] this little, you know,
[1:23:43] Why didn't he say an eagle? What? I
[1:23:45] mean, big majestic bird. He picks this
[1:23:48] little sparrow.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; A nothing
[1:23:52] most people would take a pot shot at to
[1:23:54] run away from their house.
[1:23:57] And he picks this little bird. He said,
[1:23:59] "Not even one of these can fall to the
[1:24:02] ground, and I don't know about it."
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; And he said, "How much more value are
[1:24:08] you?"
[1:24:09] He saw you when you fell down. He saw
[1:24:13] you when Satan took you down to the
[1:24:14] depths. He saw you when all of that
[1:24:16] stuff was going on in your life and you
[1:24:18] started speaking the language of
[1:24:19] unbelief and you started speaking those
[1:24:21] things and it tore you down to such a
[1:24:23] point to where you feel like you can't
[1:24:24] even look up no more. He sees you
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; and he's drawing you and he's pulling
[1:24:31] you and he's calling you. But you have
[1:24:34] to say, God, we got to make got a
[1:24:35] choice. Am I going to stay in the same
[1:24:37] spot and go down and further in my own
[1:24:39] unbelief and and speak more of the
[1:24:41] language of doubts and fears and I can't
[1:24:43] do it. It ain't even possible or am I
[1:24:45] going to start speaking faith? Am I
[1:24:47] going to start saying yes, God loves me?
[1:24:50] [snorts]
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, God cares for me. Why would I STILL
[1:24:52] BE HERE? WHY WOULD I STILL STILL BE
[1:24:54] ALIVE? WHY WOULD GOD AND WHY WOULD THIS
[1:24:57] HOW CAN I EVEN BE IN THIS SERVICE
[1:24:58] TONIGHT? YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE GOD LOVES
[1:25:00] YOU.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. Thank you, LORD.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; I AM BOUGHT, PURCHASED. I HAVE ETERNAL
[1:25:07] LIFE. HE WILL RENEW MY STRENGTH. I AM
[1:25:10] THE APPLE OF HIS EYE. I'M ACCEPTED IN
[1:25:12] CHRIST. GOD WILL MEET MY NEEDS. I MADE
[1:25:14] THE I'M MADE IN THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF
[1:25:16] GOD. I'M LOVED BY GOD. GOD CARES FOR ME.
[1:25:19] I AM AN OVERCOMER. I THE LORD IS MY
[1:25:22] STRENGTH. HE IS MY DELIVERER. He will
[1:25:24] strengthen me. He is my defense. HE IS
[1:25:27] MY REFUGE. HE IS MY PEACE. HE IS MY
[1:25:29] MEDIATOR. AMEN.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; THESE IS LANGUAGES OF FAITH. HE WILL
[1:25:34] WORK EVERYTHING FOR MY GOOD. AMEN. HE
[1:25:37] WILL COMPLETE ME. I WILL HAVE A SOUND
[1:25:39] MIND. I WILL BE IN THE BODY OF CHRIST.
[1:25:42] HE WILL MEET MY NEEDS. I AM HIS. HE WILL
[1:25:45] KEEP ME and he is mine.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; He is my shepherd. I am [snorts] his
[1:25:52] sheep. He loads me daily with benefits.
[1:25:55] He brought me abundant life. He wants my
[1:25:57] fellowship. He will never overload me.
[1:26:00] He will keep me. He will bring me to the
[1:26:03] water and to have to have drink. I have
[1:26:06] I have living waters. I am his friend. I
[1:26:08] AM HIS BRANCH. I WILL BEAR HIS FRUIT. I
[1:26:11] AM IN CHRIST. I AM ONE SPIRIT WITH HIM.
[1:26:14] I AM COMPLETE IN HIM. HE IS MY HIGH
[1:26:16] PRIEST. HE IS THE AUTHOR AND THE
[1:26:18] FINISHER OF MY FAITH.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; SO HE WHO STARTED THE WORK WILL FINISH
[1:26:23] THE WORK.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; He is not ashamed of me. He is my
[1:26:28] brother. He is my father. He is my
[1:26:31] healer. He hears my prayers. He answers
[1:26:34] my prayers. THE LORD IS MY HELP.
[1:26:47] In the time of trouble, he will comfort
[1:26:49] me. His grace is sufficient. He will
[1:26:52] never leave me nor forsake me. Sin has
[1:26:55] no dominion over me.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody needs to say that. Sin
[1:27:00] has no dominion over me.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Say it like Jesus did. That Satan
[1:27:05] has come AND HE HAS NO PART WITH ME.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; I have been quickened FROM THE DEAD. I
[1:27:11] AM AN HEIR OF GOD. I HAVE AN
[1:27:13] INHERITANCE. NO WEAPON AGAINST ME WILL
[1:27:15] PROSPER. GOD WANTS ME TO PROSPER. GOD
[1:27:18] SAID, "TRIALS ARE FOR MY GOOD. I AM
[1:27:20] BLESSED, THEREFORE, I AM HAPPY. I AM
[1:27:23] BLAMELESS IN HIS SIGHT."
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; How can you be blameless in his sight,
[1:27:32] brother Timothy? [snorts] We sin every
[1:27:34] day because I have a blameless lamb.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; I have a blood sacrificed for my sins.
[1:27:42] Amen.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; And I have a life that has come on the
[1:27:45] inside of me and transformed me.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Therefore, I can forgive
[1:27:51] others.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Yep. That's the language of faith.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Unbelief says, "I can't let that go.
[1:28:05] It hurts too much. It's too much pain.
[1:28:08] If I let that go, that sets them free."
[1:28:11] No. It sets you free.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; If they done wrong, they going to have
[1:28:17] to pay for it and give an account to it.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; That's not setting anybody free by
[1:28:21] forgiving them. That's that's between
[1:28:22] them and God. But what forgiveness does
[1:28:24] is set us free.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; That's the language of faith. Amen. I
[1:28:28] will not avenge myself. God died for me.
[1:28:31] I have assurance he will keep me. If I
[1:28:33] fall, if I make a mistake, I will get
[1:28:36] up.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; HELLO. I WILL GET UP
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; CUZ I AM CALLED. I'M CHOSEN AND
[1:28:43] FAITHFUL. I BELONG TO A PRIESTHOOD. I'M
[1:28:45] A WRITTEN EPISTLE. I CAN DO ALL THINGS
[1:28:48] THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGTHEN ME. I CAN
[1:28:50] ASK IN HIS NAME. AND IF I SUBMIT AND
[1:28:52] RESIST SATAN, HE WILL FLEE FROM ME. AND
[1:28:55] WHEN I OVERCOME, I WILL INHERIT ALL
[1:28:57] THINGS. GOD WILL CHANGE THIS OLD VILE
[1:29:00] BODY. HE WILL NEVER LEAVE ME. IN HIS
[1:29:02] PRESENCE, THERE'S FULLNESS of joy.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; He will preserve me. He will hold my
[1:29:08] right hand and help me. I am delivered
[1:29:10] from all my enemies. I have help in time
[1:29:12] of trouble. Therefore, I will be
[1:29:14] delivered out of my trouble. He will
[1:29:16] deliver me from sickness. He will
[1:29:18] deliver ME FROM AFFLICTION. I HAVE
[1:29:20] DIVINE GUIDANCE. THEREFORE, I HAVE
[1:29:21] DIVINE PROTECTION. HE MAKES ME DWELL IN
[1:29:24] SAFETY, AND I WILL LAY DOWN IN PEACE and
[1:29:27] sleep.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; He giveth his beloved sleep. And when
[1:29:34] thou lies down, thy sleep shall be
[1:29:36] sweet.
[1:29:38] I am an attribute of God. God
[1:29:40] predestinated predestinated me to this
[1:29:43] age. No one can take my place.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; You're bragging, Brother Timothy. No,
[1:29:52] I'm just saying what his word said.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; That's what his word says.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; No one can take my place. Amen.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; God predestinated me for this age. I
[1:30:04] came from the mind of God.
[1:30:07] His presence is with me. I have his
[1:30:10] presence when I feel nothing.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Why? Because his word says I do.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; I am the object of his love. I BRING GOD
[1:30:23] PLEASURE. I BELONG TO HIS KINGDOM. I
[1:30:26] WILL NOT FEAR FAILURE. I'M PART OF A
[1:30:28] GLORIOUS CHURCH. I WILL THEREFORE I
[1:30:30] WON'T HOLD GRUDGES. I MUST AND WILL HAVE
[1:30:33] PERFECT LOVE. I WILL LOVE LIKE JESUS
[1:30:35] LOVED. I AM A VESSEL OF MERCY PREPARED
[1:30:38] UNTO GLORY.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; I am called a child of God. My angel is
[1:30:43] always with ME. AND IF GOD BE FOR ME,
[1:30:47] IF GOD BE FOR ME, WHO CAN BE AGAINST ME?
[1:30:50] HEAVEN IS MY HOPE. THE RAPTURE IS FOR
[1:30:53] ME. THE MARRIAGE SUPPER IS FOR ME. THE
[1:30:55] MILLENNIUM IS FOR ME. THE HOLY CITY IS
[1:30:58] IN MY FUTURE.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; I HAVE A PLACE PREPARED FOR ME.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; NOT PREPARED FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. PREPARED
[1:31:07] FOR ME. AND WHEN THERE IS NO MORE DEVIL.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; WHEN THERE IS NO MORE DEVIL, I STILL
[1:31:17] WILL BE.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN THERE'S NO MORE CANCER,
[1:31:24] WHEN THERE'S NO MORE FEAR, WHEN THERE'S
[1:31:26] NO MORE UNBELIEF, WHEN THERE'S NO MORE
[1:31:28] DOUBTS, WHEN THERE'S NO MORE SIN, I
[1:31:30] STILL WILL BE.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Start speaking
[1:31:38] the language of faith.
[1:31:41] Speak it over your life. Speak it over
[1:31:43] your children.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Speak it over your spouse. Speak it over
[1:31:48] your home. Speak it over this church.
[1:31:52] Yes.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Speak it. Don't allow the devil to clam
[1:31:59] you down with some doubt or some
[1:32:00] unbelief. We've been commissioned to
[1:32:02] tear the stronghold down. Go listen to
[1:32:04] it again. Tear them down.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Tear them down.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Tear them down. This is exactly what
[1:32:14] what uh Caleb and Joshua did when they
[1:32:16] first got into the promised land. They
[1:32:18] tore walls down.
[1:32:20] They said, "This thing ain't going to
[1:32:22] hold us. It ain't going to stand no
[1:32:23] more. We're going to do what he said and
[1:32:24] we're going to march around here and
[1:32:26] we're going TO LET FORTH A SHOUT."
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; They had TO DO SOMETHING. LISTEN, GOD
[1:32:32] DIDN'T JUST PUT IT ALL ON THEIR MARCHING
[1:32:33] AND THEY'RE WALKING and and all of that.
[1:32:35] Well, I got to walk right. I GOT TO DO
[1:32:36] THAT. NO. GOD SAID, "AT ONE POINT,
[1:32:38] YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; AT ONE POINT, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
[1:32:42] SPEAK. AND WHEN IT'S A TIME APPOINTED, I
[1:32:45] WANT YOU TO SPEAK." AMEN.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; AND DON'T SPEAK YOUR FAULTS AND YOUR
[1:32:49] FAILURES AND YOUR MISTAKES. WE SHOULD
[1:32:51] HAVE BEEN HERE 40 YEARS AGO. WE SHOULD
[1:32:53] HAVE DONE THAT. NO, YOU START SPEAKING
[1:32:55] FAITH. THESE WALLS ARE COMING DOWN.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, that's what we got to do. WE GOT
[1:33:00] TO START SPEAKING TO THOSE WALLS THAT
[1:33:02] ARE HOLDING PRODALS. WE GOT TO START
[1:33:04] SPEAKING TO THOSE WALLS OF SICKNESS
[1:33:06] THAT'S HOLDING PEOPLE. LISTEN, THERE'S
[1:33:07] WALLS OF CANCER THAT HAS HELD PEOPLE FOR
[1:33:10] TOO LONG. THERE'S WALLS OF DOUBT AND
[1:33:12] FEAR AND ANXIETY THAT'S HELD PEOPLE TOO
[1:33:14] LONG. BUT THERE'S A PEOPLE THAT'S BEEN
[1:33:16] COMMISSIONED ON THIS EARTH TO speak
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; and to speak the LANGUAGE OF FAITH AND
[1:33:22] WATCH AND SEE THOSE WALLS FALL DOWN.
[1:33:26] [applause]
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; DO I HAVE A JOSHUA HERE TONIGHT? DO I
[1:33:30] HAVE A CALEB HERE TONIGHT? SAY, "YES,
[1:33:31] LORD. I'M GOING TO SPEAK YOUR WORD. I'M
[1:33:34] GOING TO SAY THE PROMISES OF GOD. I'M
[1:33:36] GOING TO TEAR DOWN STRONGHOLDS."
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Stand to her feet.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; I'm going to let it stay in my way. I
[1:33:44] GOT A VOICE AND MY VOICE IS NOT GOING TO
[1:33:47] GIVE HEED TO DOUBTS AND FEARS. IT'S
[1:33:49] GOING TO SPEAK THE word of God.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Speak what he says
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; and watch those walls come down.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Watch it happen. Watch it move. Watch it
[1:34:05] change. [snorts]
[1:34:11] Watch it go forth.
[1:34:14] Too many times we shrunk back in our
[1:34:16] fear and our unbelief.
[1:34:18] Well, and we use this cop out. I'm just
[1:34:20] going to say it, but I just don't know
[1:34:22] if it's the Lord's will. The Lord's will
[1:34:24] is his word.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; It's always his will to heal.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Because it's his word.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; It's his will to save. It's his will to
[1:34:37] set free. It's his will to do things
[1:34:40] abundantly and more than we could ever
[1:34:41] think or speak or ask. It's his word.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; So therefore, we can ask and we'll take
[1:34:46] it.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; We believe it
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; because he said it.
[1:34:52] Speak to the mountain. What's that?
[1:34:54] Giants come calling my name.
[1:34:57] Maybe you need to change your vocabulary
[1:34:59] tonight.
[1:35:02] Brother Timothy, I've been speaking the
[1:35:03] wrong things.
[1:35:06] speaking [music] my doubts,
[1:35:08] my fears,
[1:35:10] allowed it to drag me down to some
[1:35:12] terrible [music] places.
[1:35:14] But tonight, Lord, I want to speak your
[1:35:16] faith.
[1:35:17] I want to start speaking the promises of
[1:35:19] God.
[1:35:21] If you need prayer, I'll be [music] glad
[1:35:22] to pray for you about it. Won't you come
[1:35:24] to him? Will you say it? I'll go. Lord,
[1:35:27] I followed the wrong thing a long time,
[1:35:28] but I want to follow you now. I want to
[1:35:31] walk [music] with you. I want to be led
[1:35:33] by you, Lord. I want to give myself to
[1:35:36] you cuz I know there's much greater
[1:35:37] [music] things than the devil's ever
[1:35:38] done. Listen, the devil ain't done
[1:35:40] nothing with some of you but trashed
[1:35:41] your lives and tore you from one side to
[1:35:43] the other. Come to a God that can bring
[1:35:46] healing and deliverance and put things
[1:35:48] back [music] together where you thought
[1:35:49] it was impossible. Let God do a miracle,
[1:35:52] but it starts with surrender. [music]
[1:35:54] I will go.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Let's bow hearts. Father,
[1:36:00] we need you tonight, Lord, to come and
[1:36:02] [music] speak to hearts and lives.
[1:36:04] Little thought you put on my heart,
[1:36:07] Lord, as I listened to brother Tim speak
[1:36:10] just the other day on pulling down of
[1:36:11] strongholds.
[1:36:14] Oh Jesus.
[1:36:16] Lord, may every [music] wall just begin
[1:36:18] to crumble at the voice of resurrection
[1:36:21] that's in the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:24] Begin to speak, Lord, faith.
[1:36:27] Speak, Lord, the things of God.
[1:36:30] Believe,
[1:36:32] Lord. Let faith [music] arise in hearts.
[1:36:34] Maybe they haven't had faith in their
[1:36:36] life in a long time, but tonight, that
[1:36:38] little spark, you mean to tell me Jesus
[1:36:40] loves me? You mean to [music] tell me he
[1:36:43] cares for me? You mean to tell me after
[1:36:46] all my faults and failures and mistakes
[1:36:48] and things, [music] he still loves me?
[1:36:50] Yes. He ain't never changed his mind.
[1:36:55] He loved us when we were unlovable.
[1:36:58] Every one of us here tonight was in an
[1:37:00] unlovable state, an unlovable form. But
[1:37:02] God still loved us [music] and he gave
[1:37:05] himself for us. He changed us.
[1:37:09] Now all we want to do is just give our
[1:37:11] adoration and praises [music] back to
[1:37:12] you, Lord, and thanksgiving, Lord, that
[1:37:15] you didn't leave us where you found us.
[1:37:17] [music] You didn't leave us in that old
[1:37:18] muck of the mire of the world, but you
[1:37:21] drawed us out of there, Lord, like that
[1:37:23] lily out of a pond. pulled us up to the
[1:37:26] surface, Lord, [music] so we can bloom
[1:37:28] into the righteousness of God.
[1:37:31] Oh Jesus, we [music] love you, Father,
[1:37:32] with all of our hearts. We praise you in
[1:37:35] Jesus name.
[1:37:37] Hallelujah. Let's worship the Lord. Why
[1:37:39] [singing] would I worry?
[1:37:42] Giants come calling my name.
[1:37:44] [music and singing]
[1:37:50] My God [singing] is [music] so much
[1:37:53] bigger. The trials I face. I face.
[1:38:00] Oh, why would I hunger?
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Why would [singing] I hunger?
[1:38:05] Power [music] over.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Oh [singing]
[1:38:13] my [music] God is so much better than
[1:38:17] all of these [music] things.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; I won't be shaken.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; I won't be [music and singing] shen.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; I won't [music and singing] be moved.
[1:38:35] My [singing] God is faithful. [music]
[1:38:40] His [singing] promises.
[1:38:46] Speak to the mountain.
[1:38:49] [singing]
[1:38:52] It's time [music] to move.
[1:38:57] My [singing] God is bigger, [music]
[1:39:00] better, stronger, greater than you.
[1:39:10] My enies [music and singing] scaven
[1:39:14] all the battle is done.
[1:39:17] [singing and music]
[1:39:22] My God is stronger. The victory
[1:39:26] [music and singing] already won.
[1:39:33] [music] He died for my [singing]
[1:39:35] handsome and rose up all of her name.
[1:39:40] [music and singing]
[1:39:45] My God is gater [singing] than
[1:39:49] heaven.
[1:39:52] [music]
[1:39:55] I won't be shen. [music]
[1:39:58] [singing]
[1:40:00] I won't be.
[1:40:06] My God [music and singing] is faithful.
[1:40:11] His promise [music and singing] is true.
[1:40:17] I'll speak [music and singing] to my
[1:40:24] son. [music]
[1:40:29] My God [singing] is bigger, [music]
[1:40:32] better, stronger, greater than you.
[1:40:37] [music]
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; There's [singing] no mountain to high,
[1:40:46] no [music] valley to roll. There's no
[1:40:49] fear that I have. [music] He doesn't
[1:40:52] [singing] already know. There's no
[1:40:55] problem to me. There's no [singing]
[1:40:58] weapon too strong. There [music] is
[1:41:01] nothing for God that's impossible.
[1:41:06] There's no mountain [music]
[1:41:07] to hide. No valley [singing] to low.
[1:41:12] There's no fear [music] that I have. He
[1:41:15] doesn't already [singing] know. There's
[1:41:18] no [music] problem to me. There's no
[1:41:21] weapon too strong. [singing]
[1:41:23] There is nothing for God. That's
[1:41:27] impossible. [music]
[1:41:33] I won't be sh
[1:41:36] [music]
[1:41:39] [singing]
[1:41:44] [music]
[1:41:45] [singing]
[1:41:45] is faithful.
[1:41:50] His promises [music and singing]
[1:41:54] I'm going to speak. I'll speak
[1:41:56] [music and singing] to them.
[1:42:02] It's [music] time to move. It's time to
[1:42:05] [singing] move.
[1:42:07] My God [music] is bigger, better,
[1:42:12] stronger, greater [music] than you. I
