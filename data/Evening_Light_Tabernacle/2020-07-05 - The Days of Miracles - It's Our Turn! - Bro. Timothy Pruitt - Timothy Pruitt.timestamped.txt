[53:45] let's turn to job chapter five and verse
[53:47] eight
[54:02] amen as I was looking on the things that
[54:05] I have this morning brother Andrew
[54:07] Spencer sent me the scripture went right
[54:10] along with what I was looking at and I
[54:12] said thank you I'm gonna steal that he
[54:15] said well I felt like you needed that
[54:16] and I said well I did so amen job
[54:19] chapter five and verse eight said I
[54:20] would seek unto God and unto God well
[54:24] would I commit my calls which to do with
[54:28] great things and unsearchable
[54:32] marvelous things without number a man
[54:36] would let you be seated this morning
[54:39] he meant I I was very much blessed by
[54:44] the service on Wednesday night I believe
[54:46] it was a prophetic service Amen with
[54:49] with Amen with prophetic words that were
[54:53] spoken amen not just word from a mortal
[54:56] man but God speaking through a mortal
[54:58] man amen we really appreciate brother
[55:00] Ron and brother Andrew for coming and
[55:03] being with us but you know many thought
[55:05] that he came because my mom was in this
[55:07] area in the situation that she's been in
[55:10] but actually the plans were already in
[55:12] place for him to come he meant he had
[55:15] you can go back and listen to brother
[55:18] Andrew spoke about it somewhat on the on
[55:21] the Wednesday but you can go look at the
[55:23] service brother ron spoke a couple of
[55:25] Sundays ago on I must get to Jesus and
[55:28] and he and him began to realize that he
[55:31] spoke that he wanted to speak it amen
[55:34] from him his own life very personal
[55:36] because you know you can use stories of
[55:39] Jarius or or the woman who touched the
[55:41] hem of His garment all those things but
[55:43] until you realize that you have to get
[55:45] to Jesus
[55:47] and and he said as he spoke things of
[55:49] how they would take people 1718 hours to
[55:53] go and be in the meetings of brother
[55:54] Branham or to be at Jesus's feet
[55:56] whatever it took to get there he began
[55:59] to realize he was speaking of his own
[56:00] self and and he felt that he had to come
[56:03] here amen and and just to have a moment
[56:06] with the Lord and and do and do the
[56:09] impossible it it was impossible to think
[56:11] that he can make that kind of journey
[56:13] but hey man we heard the service
[56:15] Wednesday night and they got right in
[56:17] the car and left and he they went drove
[56:21] to Meridian and about five hours from
[56:24] here got a motel got up the next morning
[56:26] made it home about Thursday about 9:30
[56:29] their time or so ten o'clock their time
[56:31] and he got the next morning went to work
[56:33] with his boys amen and God has been
[56:36] moving in possible situations
[56:45] and you know I actually
[56:49] actually was looking upon the things
[56:51] again the next couple of days as I was
[56:53] pondering the things that were spoke
[56:56] Wednesday night I knew it was not
[56:58] something that ought to go in one ear
[56:59] and out the other I don't believe any
[57:01] service should be that way but it just
[57:03] seemed to be the Lord was speaking some
[57:05] specific things and so looking upon them
[57:08] I went back and I begin to read the
[57:11] chapter of Daniel where Daniel went to
[57:13] the lion's den and you know in Daniel 6
[57:16] it was the presidents of the kingdom and
[57:18] the governors and the princes and the
[57:19] counselors and the captains that
[57:21] consulted together against Daniel and it
[57:25] just spoke in my heart they said read on
[57:27] a few more lines read on a few more
[57:29] verses and I kept reading and I'm
[57:31] beginning to read as Daniel came out of
[57:32] the lion's den and and then in chapter 6
[57:36] and verse 24 said the king commanded
[57:38] that they brought those men which had
[57:41] accused Daniel and they cast them into
[57:44] the den of lions them their children
[57:47] their wives and the Lions had the
[57:49] mastery of them and break all their
[57:51] bones into pieces or ever or ever they
[57:55] came out at the bottom of the den and
[57:57] the Lord spoke to me and said is there
[57:59] time
[58:00] to have a turn in the lion's den
[58:03] hey man I'm looking forward to that
[58:05] moment I believe when cancer goes into
[58:08] that lion's den and we're not talking
[58:10] about natural lines we're talking about
[58:11] the line of the tribe of Judah hey man
[58:14] the root and offspring of David when
[58:16] they go in they're not coming out
[58:17] because he's going to be more than
[58:19] victorious a membrane bleeds are going
[58:22] in that lines dim whatever spirit this
[58:25] morning has their moment they don't have
[58:26] their moment in that lines den with the
[58:29] king of kings and the Lord of lords
[58:31] amen and so this morning as we as you
[58:35] know we've been in this battle since
[58:37] last time over a week now with sister
[58:40] Karen a week ago Thursday night had a
[58:43] tremendous brain bleeding and the
[58:46] doctors actually was not given much hope
[58:49] it was not I actually wanted spoke to
[58:52] brother Joe as I I was on my way home
[58:55] from being out of town with my wife our
[58:57] anniversary and and the doctors was I
[58:59] was trying to call brother Joe cuz I
[59:02] knew you know being mend and he was able
[59:04] to maybe get in there to where she was
[59:05] at because of the kovat situation there
[59:08] not allowing that anybody to come in and
[59:10] so he called me and I let him know what
[59:13] was going on and he was able to run down
[59:15] there and see her and the doctors told
[59:17] him said in which he did not relay this
[59:20] to us at the time but he said the
[59:22] doctors told him she might live five
[59:23] minutes just might live a few moments
[59:26] five years but there's not much hope but
[59:29] you know we immediately begin to turn
[59:33] our eyes from what we see and look past
[59:36] what we see you have to look to the
[59:38] unseen I don't care if it's a toothache
[59:40] or what it is you need to look to the
[59:43] unseen to look that God has paid the
[59:45] price God has given a man the answer for
[59:49] it and God is more than able yet more
[59:51] than able for whatever the need is
[59:53] and this morning as we begin to speak
[59:56] about these things the thought begin to
[59:59] come on my heart because I begin to
[1:00:01] think about what day we're living in and
[1:00:04] what time we're living in and what what
[1:00:06] what what we're seeing around us and you
[1:00:08] know the devil always wants to point us
[1:00:10] to all the negative negativity and all
[1:00:13] the things that's going on around us and
[1:00:15] how bad this is and how bad that is and
[1:00:17] get our eyes off of the most amazing
[1:00:21] time there's ever been to live him amen
[1:00:23] it's a time the moment of the coming of
[1:00:26] the Lord and and and you know as as
[1:00:28] brother I just want us to go back for a
[1:00:30] moment brother Ron came down on Monday
[1:00:32] because as the situation begin to make a
[1:00:35] turn very quickly
[1:00:36] Thursday Friday she lay there without
[1:00:39] looked like any kind of response or
[1:00:41] anything Saturday she'd begin to come
[1:00:43] back and the Sunday should begin to come
[1:00:45] back and on Saturday my dad texted me
[1:00:47] said look look I'm fixing the message
[1:00:49] brother Ron I think he still has to come
[1:00:51] it's just the devil is trying to block
[1:00:54] this and I said you know I said you're
[1:00:56] absolutely right I said actually when I
[1:00:58] was on my way up to our little getaway
[1:01:00] with me and my wife I was speaking to
[1:01:02] brother Ron he was relaying to me all
[1:01:04] the things that had taken place and how
[1:01:06] he had to get to Jesus and he stopped
[1:01:07] and he said now you watch the devil is
[1:01:10] gonna try to block it and the devil did
[1:01:13] everything he could to block it amen but
[1:01:15] as we heard Wednesday night the devil
[1:01:17] can do everything he can but he don't
[1:01:19] have enough he meant because if he had
[1:01:21] enough he'd bring enough but he don't
[1:01:23] have enough
[1:01:24] hallelujah hey man and so we he came
[1:01:29] Monday and we had prayer Monday night
[1:01:30] but on Tuesday we had a little time
[1:01:33] together at the at the lake house and
[1:01:35] and and with the brothers brother Aaron
[1:01:38] brother Michael myself and he and the
[1:01:41] ones that came brother Ron dad and my
[1:01:43] two boys and we began to as we after we
[1:01:46] ate lunch we sat down and in the little
[1:01:48] living room there and begin to just you
[1:01:49] could tell the conversation immediately
[1:01:52] went to the supernatural and the things
[1:01:53] of God were doing and how God was moving
[1:01:56] and how God was changing and how God was
[1:02:00] operating even in the middle of darkness
[1:02:02] and and you know as time went on we said
[1:02:06] I don't know sit there for several hours
[1:02:08] speaking about the things of God and you
[1:02:10] feel the atmosphere begin to build and
[1:02:13] and brother Aaron had to go and he got
[1:02:14] up to leave and my dad said no we're
[1:02:16] gonna have a time of Prayer and so he
[1:02:18] brother injury was also out on the phone
[1:02:20] and so he called him in and we knelt
[1:02:22] down and I'm gonna tell you the power of
[1:02:24] God fell on that place and begin to move
[1:02:27] in supernatural realm God began to speak
[1:02:30] and sit so in the situation we got
[1:02:33] through praying therefore brother Ronon
[1:02:34] and just that week my dad had been out
[1:02:37] there preparing for their coming and
[1:02:39] with them with my two boys and Luke had
[1:02:41] expressed to him what was on his heart
[1:02:43] how he was seeking the baptism of the
[1:02:45] Holy Ghost and and my dad just said Luke
[1:02:47] it's your turn it's your time to receive
[1:02:51] it and we grabbed ahold of him brother
[1:02:53] Ron jumped up out of his seat and we
[1:02:54] begin to pray and we give the Lord just
[1:02:57] met Luke they're in a spiritual way and
[1:02:59] changed his life forever
[1:03:01] hey man we sat down for a moment to
[1:03:03] catch a breath and brother Ron sitting
[1:03:05] across from me I looked at him and
[1:03:06] Andrew standing there
[1:03:08] standing there kind of with his hands
[1:03:11] holding his head looking down hatton
[1:03:14] mood and brother Ron looked at me and he
[1:03:15] looked at Andrew and he looked at me he
[1:03:17] looked up at Andrew and he said Andrew
[1:03:19] you need the same thing come here and he
[1:03:22] began to pray for him and and as the
[1:03:24] Spirit of God hit Andrew Andrew raised
[1:03:26] up his hands they screamed out it's my
[1:03:28] turn it's
[1:03:32] my turn
[1:03:36] hallelujah and this is where I actually
[1:03:40] came to on this thought the days of
[1:03:43] miracles it's our turn it's our turn
[1:03:47] amen you know I was actually just
[1:03:49] getting the report right now sister
[1:03:51] Karen she had a good night and let me
[1:03:54] let me say every day has been a
[1:03:56] progression towards health every day
[1:03:58] sure there's been times it kind of waned
[1:04:00] and you wondered and the devil try to
[1:04:03] point out every negative sign but every
[1:04:05] day has been a good day hey man they
[1:04:07] said last night she had a good night
[1:04:09] with no issues and remains in the NICU
[1:04:11] but I just got word they're moving her
[1:04:13] to a regular room right now it's
[1:04:15] continually to improve
[1:04:21] hallelujah
[1:04:23] he said to be more specific she has
[1:04:26] improved to the point she's speaking
[1:04:28] with clarity she's moving all limbs her
[1:04:31] memory is good her eyesight is good
[1:04:33] she's aware of all of her surroundings
[1:04:35] even the nurses out in the hall she's
[1:04:37] aware of them she's conversing with them
[1:04:40] she has no drawing in her face or any of
[1:04:42] her limbs she's an absolute miracle the
[1:04:45] brain and her blood the bleed in her
[1:04:47] brain had pushed the right side of her
[1:04:48] brain out of place and put a lot of
[1:04:50] pressure if there's a weakness on one
[1:04:52] side it might is very minimal but we
[1:04:55] have so much to be thankful for and have
[1:04:57] come a long ways in a very short time
[1:05:00] and this morning she'd been sitting up
[1:05:02] for over in an hour I
[1:05:09] don't think we can really wrap our minds
[1:05:12] around the miracle that's taking place a
[1:05:14] week ago Thursday merit medical
[1:05:16] professionals advise my dad said we do
[1:05:18] you as prepare for death do you want to
[1:05:21] resuscitate or do you do you want her to
[1:05:23] have this surgery we don't give much

[1:05:44] Lord of lords that's my god amen and I
[1:05:48] was reading this this morning I was me
[1:05:50] guard this week as I began to think on
[1:05:52] these things if you remember brother
[1:05:54] brother David mayors spoke right before
[1:05:56] our services and he said the time is now
[1:05:58] for the miraculous for the phenomenal
[1:06:01] amen and I began to look for that to
[1:06:03] where he may have brought come from but
[1:06:05] got that inspiration and I found a quote
[1:06:07] brother Branham said I believe that the
[1:06:09] ages come now the miraculous the
[1:06:12] phenomenal the baptism of the Spirit
[1:06:15] power in signs and wonders this great
[1:06:18] pouring out of God's Spirit in this last

[1:06:24] into the people that will take a rapture
[1:06:27] I don't know yeah hey man you know where
[1:06:30] people want to say well a days of
[1:06:32] miracles pass if you notice they don't
[1:06:34] say that the miracles don't exist or God
[1:06:36] didn't perform miracles they say that
[1:06:38] the day has passed but I want you to
[1:06:40] tell you I won't tell I'm do you
[1:06:42] understand one thing this morning we are
[1:06:44] living in that day we are living in the
[1:06:47] day that any moment the greatest miracle
[1:06:49] that it can ever take place the change
[1:06:52] of this whole body missing limbs to come

[1:07:03] day there's ever been hey man and I'm
[1:07:06] seeing the supernatural God moving in a
[1:07:09] supernatural people because where Jesus
[1:07:12] is there is miracles where Jesus is
[1:07:15] there is the supernatural and he
[1:07:17] promised you would be with us even in us
[1:07:20] to the ends of the world hallelujah I
[1:07:22] don't know what you're seeing you might
[1:07:23] be seeing darkness you might be seeing
[1:07:25] Laodicea in all its works you might see
[1:07:28] how hopeless but I see light shining I
[1:07:31] see the Word of God being revealed and
[1:07:34] his people and where he is there is
[1:07:37] miracles where he is there is signs and
[1:07:39] wonders where he is there is healings
[1:07:41] there's deliverance there's the baptism
[1:07:44] of the Holy Ghost where he is all things
[1:07:47] are possible
[1:07:49] hallelujah I begin to read in the first
[1:07:52] book of Acts and I want you to
[1:07:53] understand as we know Amen as well Amen
[1:07:56] well learn message members but it has to
[1:07:59] be more than a learned idea it has to be
[1:08:01] a revelation in your heart Amen we are
[1:08:03] writing another book of Acts amen they
[1:08:06] wrote a book we're writing their own
[1:08:07] book and it'll have the same signs they
[1:08:10] don't have the same wonders you don't
[1:08:12] have the same miracles you don't have
[1:08:14] because it's the same God he many Kinki
[1:08:17] if God is God he don't change Oh
[1:08:19] hallelujah
[1:08:20] this is what he says in acts 2 verse 22
[1:08:23] he said you men of Israel hear these
[1:08:25] words
[1:08:26] he did like to have and I quote here
[1:08:29] these words Jesus of Nazareth a man
[1:08:32] approved of God among you by miracles
[1:08:35] and wonders and signs which God did by
[1:08:40] him in the midst of you as ye yourselves
[1:08:43] also know
[1:08:45] hallelujah we know he's a God of
[1:08:48] miracles how many we've seen himself
[1:08:50] heal cancer
[1:08:51] we've seen him heal no brain bleed we've
[1:08:54] seen him move in impossible situation
[1:08:57] I've seen him fill three young men when
[1:08:59] the Holy Ghost
[1:09:00] I seen him moving his people he's still
[1:09:03] moving even now
[1:09:06] he said that wasn't Jesus okay act six
[1:09:09] and verse eight and Stephen full of
[1:09:11] faith and power did great wonders and
[1:09:14] miracles among the people
[1:09:16] act six and the people which were in one
[1:09:19] of court gave heed unto those things
[1:09:22] which Philip speak hearing and seeing
[1:09:25] the miracles which he did acts 15:12
[1:09:28] then all the multitude kept silence and
[1:09:31] gave audience to Barnabas and Paul
[1:09:34] declaring what miracles and wonders God
[1:09:37] had wrought among the Gentiles by them
[1:09:40] Oh hallelujah amen acts 19 11 and God
[1:09:45] wrote special miracles by the hands of
[1:09:48] Paul
[1:09:51] so miracles I know people said well I
[1:09:54] don't look for signs and I don't look
[1:09:55] for wonders well you can't take signs
[1:09:57] and wonders out of it it's there amen
[1:10:00] God produces those things every time
[1:10:03] Jesus come there's a miracle there sign
[1:10:05] a minute brother branham were talking
[1:10:07] about the angel visitation he said every
[1:10:09] time he comes something good happens Oh
[1:10:14] hallelujah this is what it's even in the
[1:10:17] church this is what he said in first
[1:10:18] Corinthians 12 7 through 11 it says but
[1:10:21] the manifestation of the Spirit is given
[1:10:24] to every man to profit withal four to
[1:10:26] one is given the spirit the way by the
[1:10:29] spirit the word of wisdom to another the
[1:10:31] word of knowledge by the same spirit to
[1:10:34] another faith by the same spirit to
[1:10:36] another the gifts of healing by the same
[1:10:39] spirit to another the working
[1:10:45] it's in the word the working of miracles
[1:10:48] to another prophecy to another
[1:10:51] discerning of spirits to another divers
[1:10:53] kinds of tongues to another the
[1:10:55] interpretation of tongues but all these
[1:10:58] things that one and the self same spirit
[1:11:01] dividing to every man severally as he
[1:11:04] will it's a working of the same spirit
[1:11:07] so if we got the same spirit we got the
[1:11:10] same works
[1:11:11] hallelujah amen and on what I understand
[1:11:14] by the prophet of God as he would speak
[1:11:16] he would say the days of Pentecost is
[1:11:18] here again as it was on the day of
[1:11:21] Pentecost when the power of God fell
[1:11:24] upon some unlearned man and took them
[1:11:26] over and men that were cowards men that
[1:11:29] couldn't stand the pressures of the
[1:11:31] world amen they stood up in the face of
[1:11:33] that and said this is that what the
[1:11:35] Prophet Joel spoke about Oh hallelujah
[1:11:38] hey man it's a working of miracles
[1:11:41] that's what has been released in this
[1:11:43] age the phenomenal the miraculous the
[1:11:47] baptism of the holy spirit has been
[1:11:49] released again as it was on the day of
[1:11:52] Pentecost a
[1:11:54] man just as it poured out the miraculous
[1:11:57] in the first Exodus signs and great
[1:12:00] wonders so he also came himself
[1:12:02] personally with signs and great wonders
[1:12:05] in the second Exodus also he coming to
[1:12:07] third Exodus with a miraculous but the
[1:12:09] Holy Spirit being poured out gathering
[1:12:11] to himself a people who will believe for
[1:12:15] the impossible
[1:12:19] praise the Lord the supernatural working
[1:12:23] in a supernatural people God fulfilling
[1:12:27] his word backing it up by the miraculous
[1:12:29] you say well we have the word we have
[1:12:31] the word wonderful yes we have the word
[1:12:34] it's an open word it's an open book so
[1:12:36] if it's open it opens everything that's
[1:12:38] in there
[1:12:40] but somehow people want to take all
[1:12:42] those out well we're not looking for
[1:12:43] miraculous we're not looking for signs
[1:12:45] and wonders we've got the word within
[1:12:47] the word that's who he is you can't
[1:12:49] separate him
[1:12:53] and so in turn they turned that the
[1:12:57] devil is allowed it to turn it from a
[1:13:00] man from being faith to an intellectual
[1:13:03] gospel and
[1:13:04] stripping the power of God out of the
[1:13:06] church to where people can't even
[1:13:08] believe for healing no more hatred that
[1:13:10] wouldn't believe it for healing enough
[1:13:12] say well it's that God has allowed us to
[1:13:14] come on me to work something out in my
[1:13:16] life even brother Brown said that's the
[1:13:18] biggest lie that's ever been he said the
[1:13:21] devil put that on you
[1:13:23] he said sure God allows us sometimes he
[1:13:27] said well what happens he allows it
[1:13:28] because if you say well we shall see
[1:13:30] miracles there has to be an opportunity
[1:13:32] for miracles to be
[1:13:36] so he allows things to come he allows
[1:13:39] cancer he allows things to come because
[1:13:42] he has these attributes that he wants to
[1:13:44] fulfill he wants to show you who he is
[1:13:46] personally vindicated to you
[1:13:49] [Music]
[1:13:50] Alleluia you cannot separate this from
[1:13:53] the word it's in the word if you
[1:13:56] separate it from the word you're
[1:13:57] teaching something other than William
[1:13:58] Branham taught or Paul taught or Jesus
[1:14:01] himself taught a
[1:14:03] man he where he is the miraculous is
[1:14:06] always present in this generation under
[1:14:09] the third pole it produced miracles
[1:14:13] come on somebody it produced miracles
[1:14:16] amen as we said they don't say that the
[1:14:19] miracles were past they say the day has
[1:14:21] passed it's at another time it's in the
[1:14:24] future time that's the devil always at
[1:14:26] work he can't talk us out of what God
[1:14:28] can do but he'll tell us it's not for
[1:14:31] our day
[1:14:33] well he did that 40 years ago and he's
[1:14:36] not doing it no more that's hogwash
[1:14:39] hey man this is the book has been open
[1:14:42] to the believer so you could believe in
[1:14:45] the supernatural
[1:14:46] it's going to take a supernatural belief
[1:14:48] that this body it's going to take a body
[1:14:51] change then if I can believe for a body
[1:14:53] change I can believe for my body to be
[1:14:56] healed delivered set free whatever God
[1:14:58] has for me I going to believe for it
[1:15:03] the third pull nothing but miraculous
[1:15:08] dead fish
[1:15:10] did you notice dead fish laying in the
[1:15:14] water it didn't go through a healing
[1:15:17] process
[1:15:18] days and months of recovery
[1:15:23] it did what the leopard did the leopard
[1:15:26] didn't have to go through skin therapy
[1:15:28] and every kind of thing and recovery
[1:15:30] amen the blind men didn't have to go
[1:15:31] through this thing when he met Jesus it
[1:15:33] all changed in a moment right there and
[1:15:37] this is what the third pole was bringing
[1:15:39] back to us a resurrected Christ among us
[1:15:42] with the same power
[1:15:44] who cares about everything and the
[1:15:47] smallest of details to where he would
[1:15:49] unleash his power on a little bitty fish
[1:15:52] it seems so in a unimportant alright
[1:15:55] little fish you shot your last wad and
[1:15:57] throws it over there in the water but
[1:15:59] the angel of God has his eye on the
[1:16:01] little fish and he opened up the word
[1:16:04] aiming the power of God flew through
[1:16:06] there and that little fish all of a
[1:16:08] sudden I give you back your life in
[1:16:10] Jesus name he didn't go through a whole
[1:16:13] rich or whole thing of a rehabilitation
[1:16:16] and all that no it was miraculous it
[1:16:20] changed it went right back to his life
[1:16:22] again in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:16:24] eye
[1:16:25] well hallelujah he meant squirrels they
[1:16:29] didn't go through the birthing process
[1:16:30] they didn't go through the growing
[1:16:32] process they was automatically made out
[1:16:34] of nothing into a complete whole living
[1:16:38] creatures fully grown and ready for
[1:16:40] harvest
[1:16:42] miraculous storm amen a storm brewing
[1:16:45] upon the earth amen was causing problems
[1:16:47] in situation and a word spoken said you
[1:16:49] go back to where you came from and it
[1:16:53] vanished too what people had to testify
[1:16:56] down there to store we were supposed to
[1:16:58] get this and we don't know what happened
[1:17:00] it's gone
[1:17:02] hallelujah a tumor he wasn't going
[1:17:05] through it processing and going through
[1:17:07] a chemo treatment and this and that in
[1:17:09] the other it was showing I am the Lord
[1:17:11] that healeth thee
[1:17:13] too many times we refer we record we're
[1:17:16] relying upon the man anointing and I
[1:17:19] thank God for the man anointing but
[1:17:21] don't forget it what an anointing we're
[1:17:23] under we are under the eagle anointing
[1:17:26] and under the eagle in order amen you
[1:17:28] don't have to swim across that River
[1:17:30] he'll take you across that River
[1:17:33] this is the time this is the moment a
[1:17:37] menace spoke out of existence had these
[1:17:39] boys Amen just in a moment late right
[1:17:42] over and gave their heart to God
[1:17:46] but Satan tries to keep us looking at a
[1:17:49] day gone or a future time to come well
[1:17:51] one day this is the day
[1:17:56] and when you realize this is your time
[1:18:01] that's the month that's the point when
[1:18:04] you realize this is my day
[1:18:07] the devil ain't got enough to stop it
[1:18:13] just as we was going through this I
[1:18:15] posted there on our Facebook
[1:18:18] communication thing for a church the
[1:18:21] Lord just so deeply put something in me
[1:18:24] because we had knelt down me and my wife
[1:18:26] and praying about this situation
[1:18:29] and
[1:18:31] now you know I used these words many
[1:18:33] times in prayer lines and things and
[1:18:35] what we bind on earth will be bound in
[1:18:37] heaven what we loose on earth will be
[1:18:39] loosed in heaven and something just
[1:18:41] spoke to me as I prayed about it said go
[1:18:43] back and look at it again
[1:18:45] went back and beginning to read and it
[1:18:48] actually that power was released by a
[1:18:51] question and an answer given
[1:18:57] who do men say that I am
[1:19:00] well the your God who moved in the 60
[1:19:04] years ago or your God who moved
[1:19:06] yesterday or you know you're a God of
[1:19:08] tomorrow and
[1:19:10] that's what they were saying they some
[1:19:12] say that you're of Eliza's bias of
[1:19:14] yesterday sure we can believe in lies
[1:19:17] yesterday he he'd done miracles he he
[1:19:19] done produced signs and wonders but and
[1:19:21] we can see that book not what about
[1:19:24] today and then begin they begin to go
[1:19:27] through all kind of things in the mind
[1:19:28] and finally the question comes in okay
[1:19:30] that's what they say but what do you say
[1:19:32] you have an opportunity to reply who do
[1:19:36] you say that I am and I'm asking even a
[1:19:38] light time and I call this morning who
[1:19:40] do you say that he is
[1:19:42] well it was brother and brother
[1:19:44] branham's day he done all this but you
[1:19:46] know instances say something and trying
[1:19:48] to go through all kind of explanation
[1:19:50] well who do you say
[1:19:54] something welled up in Peter and he said
[1:19:57] I say you are the Christ the Son of the
[1:20:00] Living God
[1:20:02] what was he doing he was bringing Christ
[1:20:05] present he was recognizing this is the
[1:20:09] day
[1:20:10] this is the moment amen he can only God
[1:20:14] can know who I was and call me by name
[1:20:16] and pull me out of the situation I was
[1:20:18] in you have to be the Christ
[1:20:21] oh
[1:20:23] my if you can look and say only God
[1:20:26] could call me by name and pull me to
[1:20:29] this place and bring me here he is
[1:20:32] nothing but the Christ
[1:20:36] and he said flesh and blood hadn't
[1:20:38] revealed to this you didn't learn this
[1:20:39] from your mama and your daddy
[1:20:42] but my father in heaven he's giving it
[1:20:45] to you and upon this revelation what
[1:20:48] revelation of who Jesus is now
[1:20:52] present right now the gates of Hell
[1:20:55] cannot prevail against it cut they're
[1:20:58] looking at that the gates of hell
[1:20:59] represents all that hell is
[1:21:02] so whatever's in Hell spirits of demons
[1:21:06] of health torment sicknesses problems
[1:21:09] situation the gates of Hell cannot
[1:21:11] prevail against that revelation when you
[1:21:13] refer it realize he's here he's right
[1:21:15] now present Oh
[1:21:17] hallelujah if we could enter into that
[1:21:20] realm this morning that this is not just
[1:21:22] an ordinary Sunday morning this is not
[1:21:24] just an ordinary service but God is here
[1:21:27] present and this is my moment with the
[1:21:30] king it's my moment in his present I'm
[1:21:32] having my opportunity
[1:21:40] he's said it like this he said God told
[1:21:43] Moses now you go and I'll send an angel
[1:21:46] before you to keep the way and to bring
[1:21:48] you into the place that I have prepared
[1:21:50] beware of him obey his voice for he will
[1:21:52] not pardon your transgressions for my
[1:21:54] name is in him that angel was they angel
[1:21:56] the Covenant which was Christ Jesus and
[1:21:59] many of them did not believe it
[1:22:03] many of them give been listening to it
[1:22:06] as me and my wife going through the
[1:22:07] Bible chapter by chapter and you here of
[1:22:10] all the miraculous things that God had
[1:22:12] done it and the supernatural works of
[1:22:14] how he delivered him out of Egypt I
[1:22:15] brought them through the Red Sea how he
[1:22:17] took them through the wilderness and
[1:22:18] they get to the promised land they said
[1:22:20] we can't do it and if we get murmuring
[1:22:24] and complaining and Margaret Africa many
[1:22:26] people did not believe it no matter what
[1:22:29] sign they saw
[1:22:32] and those who did not believe it perish
[1:22:36] but those who believed
[1:22:40] how many believers we got here this
[1:22:42] morning those that believed went into
[1:22:45] the promised land he said the man who
[1:22:48] reject light goes straight to total
[1:22:50] darkness and I believe to those today
[1:22:53] listen to this those that reject the
[1:22:55] Holy Spirit in the light of God who
[1:22:58] reject the day of miracles and
[1:23:02] so forth they will go into total
[1:23:05] darkness
[1:23:08] he said well if the hour will really
[1:23:11] come if our would come from my
[1:23:13] visitation I say God make me aware of my
[1:23:17] moment I
[1:23:21] think about it wonder what would what
[1:23:23] would be that what would we be saying I
[1:23:25] only want to really go down this road
[1:23:27] but just thoughts what would be saying
[1:23:29] if sister Atlanta and mr. missed her
[1:23:31] moment
[1:23:34] what have we said about people who did
[1:23:36] miss their moment
[1:23:43] it was a woman we will go through
[1:23:46] several of them in the Bible
[1:23:48] but the point of it is as we go through
[1:23:51] they recognize this is my moment today
[1:23:54] is the day not another service not
[1:23:57] another time not tomorrow not next week
[1:24:00] today

[1:24:15] get through to him what was it the hour
[1:24:18] was there her opportunity was there and
[1:24:21] here she comes trying to press through
[1:24:23] the crowd and then whoa people saying
[1:24:25] get back they'll pull you out of the

[1:46:04] last days for Goliath last days for
[1:46:07] cancer last days for sugar diabetes high
[1:46:10] blood pressure spirits of depression and
[1:46:13] anxiety and paying spirits of Hell is
[1:46:15] tormented your family for generation
[1:46:17] after generation they are about to have
[1:46:20] their last day
[1:46:24] hallelujah cancer is about to have his
[1:46:27] last person to live in
[1:46:29] [Applause]
[1:46:34] he come out and he gave his last
[1:46:37] hahahaha
[1:46:39] he said it one day to many
[1:46:44] because in that day brother Brandon was
[1:46:46] sitting in another place he said there
[1:46:47] was a different set of ears in the camp
[1:46:51] and nimr ears have been tuned to the
[1:46:53] supernatural rounds it had been in tune
[1:46:56] with the angels of God coming and
[1:46:58] delivering his people and delivering the
[1:47:00] line of the the Lamb of the lion out of
[1:47:02] the bear it had been tuned to another
[1:47:04] realm it had been looking at another
[1:47:06] round David knew his his little rock
[1:47:09] knit and do nothing to that line
[1:47:11] as far as it is humanly speaking he
[1:47:13] couldn't do nothing I
[1:47:15] wonder how many lately he's killed a
[1:47:18] lion with a slingshot
[1:47:19] no I ain't goal of the slingshot
[1:47:23] a bear with a slingshot
[1:47:28] he knew humanly speaking it was not him
[1:47:32] he just let the rock go and God did the
[1:47:36] rest
[1:47:36] so if he knew God could do the rest on a
[1:47:39] lion or a bear this wasn't nothing to
[1:47:41] God because this was an uncircumcised
[1:47:42] daredevil standing in his promised land
[1:47:45] that God had given God's people
[1:47:49] hallelujah and David looked around and
[1:47:51] what his words what who is that guy
[1:47:54] who is that oh it's Goliath he's he's
[1:47:58] stomping around giving his challenge
[1:48:00] he'd been here for forty days he said
[1:48:02] you mean to tell me you're letting that
[1:48:04] uncircumcised Philistine standing there
[1:48:06] and defy the armies of the Living God
[1:48:08] now David it was a lot of fighting David
[1:48:11] he knew what God had promised
[1:48:15] he said you mean to tell me you let the
[1:48:18] uncircumcised philistine tell you that
[1:48:20] days of miracles are past so now we know
[1:48:24] who's saying that
[1:48:26] for listings
[1:48:29] all that our amongest are not of us
[1:48:33] hello somebody the listings saying days
[1:48:37] of miracles are past but when Jesus
[1:48:40] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:48:43] forever
[1:48:44] [Applause]
[1:48:46] he said you mean to tell me you let him
[1:48:49] tell you that the baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:48:51] Saint is real today as it was on the day
[1:48:53] of Pentecost when it's to your children
[1:48:55] to you that so far off he said you shall
[1:48:58] receive the power after this Holy Ghost
[1:48:59] comes upon you the power
[1:49:05] he said what the need today is is some
[1:49:09] Holy Ghost spunk
[1:49:12] that's had enough for what the devil is
[1:49:15] saying and going to speak the Word of
[1:49:17] God and let that stone of faith loose
[1:49:20] and let God back it up
[1:49:26] and here it is I mentioned earlier I
[1:49:29] heard a fella say the other day that
[1:49:30] sickness is the Lord brought sicknesses
[1:49:33] and put sickness on you might be that
[1:49:35] you're sinning you've done something
[1:49:36] wrong make it right with God he said
[1:49:38] that's okay but he said the sickness is
[1:49:41] of the devil
[1:49:44] sicknesses is an attribute of sin
[1:49:46] because of sin we have sickness not
[1:49:49] because you sin but something down
[1:49:51] through generations may be visited down
[1:49:53] from the third and fourth generation but
[1:49:55] the blood of Jesus Christ takes away
[1:49:59] every sin and it takes away every
[1:50:01] sicknesses if you are a David and ready
[1:50:04] to stand in your place
[1:50:07] [Music]
[1:50:15] we don't need theological vest
[1:50:18] think done is no good for 60 years
[1:50:23] we need faith in a word of God and
[1:50:27] somebody willing to let it go
[1:50:32] this is what he would say you speak to
[1:50:35] the mountain wasn't go figure out all
[1:50:37] the quotes and figure out all the
[1:50:39] scriptures and figure out everything get
[1:50:41] it all lined up perfectly you speak and
[1:50:44] it'll happen
[1:50:45] we're living under the third pole we're
[1:50:49] living under the open word it opened up
[1:50:50] everything heaven has it opened up all
[1:50:53] of heavens blessings it opened up
[1:50:55] everything that God has given in this
[1:50:58] moment has been unloosed on us listen we
[1:51:01] say of people that are being loosed
[1:51:03] spirits of every kind of hell out of
[1:51:04] hell two hundred thousand thousand
[1:51:06] demons have been reduced from from the
[1:51:08] river Euphrates and they are falling
[1:51:10] upon people and they're taking them
[1:51:13] under their control and speaking things
[1:51:15] that makes no sense even humanly
[1:51:17] speaking they're saying things that
[1:51:18] makes no sense humanly speaking because
[1:51:20] it's not a human it's a devil
[1:51:22] but if we also see that world being
[1:51:25] poured out upon the people we also
[1:51:27] should be able to see another world a
[1:51:29] heavenly world being poured out upon the
[1:51:32] people there in that place it's time for
[1:51:35] us to be in our place
[1:51:37] and begin to live the Word of God not
[1:51:41] read it not try to understand it but
[1:51:43] make it live
[1:51:45] let it live
[1:51:47] give it room in our hearts
[1:51:56] you know I'm just gonna go personal here
[1:52:02] pour do me read this he said a man who's
[1:52:05] just got theology he'll say I believe
[1:52:10] that days of miracles are past and
[1:52:12] you'll push it off on some kind of big
[1:52:15] gutter pipe to run it off his field
[1:52:17] he don't want it on his field he doesn't
[1:52:21] want it he says what a pity
[1:52:32] I've gotten all kind of quotes of the
[1:52:35] storm and things you know the stories
[1:52:41] we've got people chattering around like
[1:52:43] a little chipmunk
[1:52:47] laughing that is being blowed out down
[1:52:49] in the storm
[1:52:51] what I thought God healed I thought God
[1:52:53] delivered I
[1:52:57] thought God didn't is I thought God
[1:53:00] healed the brain bleed I thought God
[1:53:02] healed cancer I thought bla bla bla bla
[1:53:04] ha ha ha Goliath you're about to have
[1:53:07] your last ha ha
[1:53:14] because there's a people anointed by an
[1:53:16] eagle anointing they may have been
[1:53:18] blowed down in the storm and the storms
[1:53:21] of life had caught him unaware and they
[1:53:23] come down and they was just there and
[1:53:25] for a moment but brother Adam said as I
[1:53:27] looked at that eco I noticed he wasn't
[1:53:29] even looking at me he wasn't not paying
[1:53:31] no attention to the chipmunk chatter
[1:53:33] chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter
[1:53:34] he could care less what the chick monk
[1:53:36] had to say because he was not an
[1:53:38] earthbound creature oh
[1:53:40] [Applause]
[1:53:41] come on heavenly bound people if you're
[1:53:44] heavily bound you're not earthbound and
[1:53:46] you're not worried about what earthbound
[1:53:48] people say
[1:53:49] because he just give us a moment we're
[1:53:52] just feeling the wind the wind is coming
[1:53:55] into our wings again things are
[1:53:57] beginning to happen signs and wonders
[1:53:59] are among the people God's moving in
[1:54:01] miraculous ways and it won't be long
[1:54:04] that winds gonna blow and blow to such a
[1:54:08] point it's gonna lift us out of here to
[1:54:11] go be with him in the heavenlies
[1:54:13] [Applause]
[1:54:13] [Music]
[1:54:17] I'm done listening to chatter chatter
[1:54:21] I'm listening to all things are possible
[1:54:24] I'm listening to God does impossible man
[1:54:27] I'm listening to okay I'll see you in
[1:54:30] the morning
[1:54:32] I'm listening to Shalom I'm listening to
[1:54:35] God's peace be upon you in the middle of
[1:54:38] struggles in the middle trial in the
[1:54:40] middle of the most evil age they ever
[1:54:41] been pitched alone
[1:54:46] you know when my son Andrew was born
[1:54:50] God did something very personal to me
[1:54:55] and you can tell I'm thumbing through a
[1:54:58] lot of stuff
[1:55:00] God spoke to me in a way I'll never
[1:55:03] forget
[1:55:05] Andrew was a little newborn baby
[1:55:07] struggling for his breath and the men in
[1:55:09] the hospital I remember walking in there
[1:55:12] as a doctor the pediatrician come in
[1:55:15] they took his oxygen off for just a
[1:55:17] minute and watched him turn just his
[1:55:19] blue and purple as he could be
[1:55:21] and she thought that oxygen bond there
[1:55:24] to get him out of here he's not going to
[1:55:26] die on my watch
[1:55:28] said we don't have the possibilities to
[1:55:31] treat him he's got to go to another
[1:55:33] place
[1:55:34] so here I am my wife and one hospital
[1:55:37] suffering with a c-section my son being
[1:55:40] transported to another hospital and I
[1:55:43] get in a car
[1:55:44] go to Walmart to pick up a few things
[1:55:46] there in Minden for my wife and gonna go
[1:55:49] move on to go see Andrew in the next
[1:55:51] hospital in Shreveport Shumpert
[1:55:54] turn the radio on
[1:55:59] and heard these words as a man began to
[1:56:02] speak abraham believed in God
[1:56:07] it anchored so deep into me because I'd
[1:56:10] been fighting you know as we've just
[1:56:11] read you know the thoughts come well
[1:56:13] you're going through this because you've
[1:56:15] done something or you had you know
[1:56:17] you've done something against God that's
[1:56:19] why he's punishing you know the devil
[1:56:20] sitting there - eating your lunch
[1:56:25] but I got to thinking Abraham
[1:56:29] in one side in the Old Testament
[1:56:33] lied done things wrong made mistakes
[1:56:38] read all about it it's roping there but
[1:56:41] there was a change of dispensations to
[1:56:44] our Abraham wasn't no wonder no longer
[1:56:46] under just the blood of bulls and goats
[1:56:47] he was under the blood of the Lamb and
[1:56:51] not one fault of Abraham was mentioned
[1:56:54] in this New Testament but matter of fact
[1:56:56] it says Abraham was strong in the faith
[1:56:58] and he staggered not at the promise of
[1:57:00] God and I looked and I said god I'm a
[1:57:03] son of Abraham and your blood is still
[1:57:07] applies to me and I'm not under the
[1:57:09] blood of bulls and goats I'm under the
[1:57:11] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:57:13] and the Lord spoke to me very plainly
[1:57:16] said you go in that hospital room you
[1:57:18] don't look at monitors you don't look at
[1:57:20] hoses you don't look at the baby you
[1:57:22] look at the promise
[1:57:24] and God came on the scene and moved on
[1:57:28] his behalf
[1:57:30] come out of the hospital it was out of a
[1:57:33] couple a couple of weeks went right back
[1:57:35] in the hospital with some kind of viral
[1:57:37] infection in his lungs and the doctors
[1:57:39] we got out of that doctor said well he's
[1:57:41] just gonna have loan problems his whole
[1:57:43] life here's these breathing treatments
[1:57:44] he's going to receive them for we don't
[1:57:45] know how long we just have to judge it
[1:57:47] just take start giving him these
[1:57:49] breathing treatments we started giving
[1:57:50] them breathing treatments one day my
[1:57:52] wife was giving him one she said hold up
[1:57:54] just a minute God healed his lungs why
[1:57:57] are we accepting this she takes him up
[1:58:00] for prayer at the moment she felt led to
[1:58:02] Amen on a Sunday and God came down and
[1:58:05] touched him the next day she said I'm
[1:58:07] not giving him a breathing treatment got
[1:58:09] worse and worse and worse and she said
[1:58:12] just a few days I got to look that god
[1:58:14] help me not look at this practice but
[1:58:16] look at your promise and that Monday was
[1:58:19] one of the worst days of Andrews
[1:58:21] breathing but the next day better the
[1:58:24] next day better the next day better went
[1:58:28] back to the doctor and the doctor said
[1:58:29] them breathing treatments are doing a
[1:58:31] lot of good keep him up she said I ain't
[1:58:32] gave him no more he's been healed
[1:58:44] hallelujah and he's still healed today
