[42:40] I know the master of the
[43:04] [Music]
[43:18] It's been one of those days
[43:22] that drives me to my knees.
[43:26] There's more questions and answers
[43:33] and all of the things
[43:37] I can't figure out.
[43:41] Leave me with more tears and laughter.
[43:47] I don't know
[43:49] [Music]
[43:50] how he's going to move,
[43:55] but I know
[43:58] he knows what I need.
[44:02] Sometimes he's water
[44:06] to the thirsty,
[44:09] sometimes he's fire.
[44:13] all consuming.
[44:17] And sometimes his voice
[44:20] is louder than thunder.
[44:25] [Music]
[44:27] And sometimes
[44:32] sometimes he whispers
[44:36] [Music]
[44:40] [Applause]
[44:47] So I'll be listening
[44:50] while waiting on him.
[44:55] And I'll choose to trust and believe.
[45:01] The same one who spoke
[45:04] the world into place is the same one who
[45:10] speaks peace to me.
[45:14] I don't know
[45:17] how he's going to move,
[45:21] but I know
[45:24] he knows what I need.
[45:28] Sometimes he's water
[45:32] to the thirsty.
[45:36] Sometimes he's fire.
[45:39] All consuming.
[45:43] Sometimes his voice
[45:46] is louder than thunder.
[45:50] [Music]
[45:52] Sometimes,
[45:57] sometimes he whispers,
[46:01] [Music]
[46:04] sometimes he's water
[46:08] to the thirsty,
[46:11] sometimes he's fire.
[46:14] Oh, consume me.
[46:18] Sometimes his voice
[46:21] is louder than thunder.
[46:27] And sometimes
[46:32] sometimes he whispers
[46:41] and sometimes
[46:46] sometimes he whispers.
[46:51] [Music]
[47:02] Hallelujah. I don't know how he's going
[47:04] to answer, but I just want to hear from
[47:06] him. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's stand
[47:10] together as we get ready for the word.
[47:12] When peace
[47:14] like a river
[47:18] [Music]
[47:19] attendeth
[47:23] my way.
[47:27] When sorrows
[47:29] [Music]
[47:30] like sea
[47:33] below
[47:34] road.
[47:40] Whatever
[47:44] my life,
[47:46] thou hast taught
[47:50] me to say.
[47:54] It is well.
[47:57] It is well
[48:01] with my soul. It is well.
[48:07] Oh, it
[48:09] is well.
[48:11] [Music]
[48:14] Oh, with my soul.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; With my soul.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, it is well.
[48:26] It is well
[48:29] with my soul.
[48:37] No Satan
[48:41] should buff it, no trials
[48:48] should come.
[48:50] Oh, let this
[48:53] bless
[48:55] assurance
[48:58] control
[49:00] [Music]
[49:04] that Christ
[49:06] had regarded
[49:11] my helpless
[49:14] estate
[49:16] and has shed
[49:20] his own blood
[49:23] for my my sin. Oh the bliss.
[49:30] Oh my sin.
[49:33] Oh the bliss
[49:36] of this glory
[49:41] thought.
[49:43] Oh my sin,
[49:45] not in parts,
[49:49] but the whole
[49:53] [Music]
[49:56] is n
[49:58] to the cross
[50:02] and I bear
[50:05] it. Oh, praise the Lord.
[50:09] Oh, praise the Lord.
[50:14] Oh my soul, it is well. Yes, it is well.
[50:25] [Music]
[50:26] Oh, with my soul.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, it is well.
[50:37] It is well
[50:40] with
[50:42] Oh Lord, haste the day.
[50:46] [Music]
[50:47] Oh Lord,
[50:50] haste the day
[50:52] when my face
[50:56] shall be sight.
[51:00] Oh, the clouds
[51:03] he rolled back
[51:06] as a scroll.
[51:12] Oh, the trump
[51:15] shall resound
[51:18] and the Lord
[51:21] shall
[51:22] sing.
[51:24] Even
[51:26] so
[51:27] it is well.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Oh but Lord is for thee. For thy coming
[51:34] we wait.
[51:37] But Lord
[51:40] is for thee.
[51:44] For thy coming
[51:47] we wait.
[51:50] Oh, the sky
[51:53] not the great
[51:56] is I go.
[52:01] Oh, the shout
[52:05] of the angels,
[52:09] the voice
[52:11] of the Lord.
[52:14] Oh blessed home,
[52:17] blessed
[52:19] rest
[52:21] of my soul. It is well.
[52:26] Oh, it
[52:28] is well
[52:31] [Music]
[52:33] with my soul.
[52:36] [Music]
[52:39] It is well.
[52:43] It is well
[52:46] with my soul.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:52] Lord, we wait for your coming.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; We believe we are in the hour of it.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; We have believe, Lord. We've heard the
[53:00] shout, the mighty message of God forth.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; In this last day, calling a bride to
[53:06] you. Lord, we want to just express today
[53:11] how we love you as a bride people, God,

[53:25] but a love affair, oh God. And we want
[53:29] to say we love you with all our heart,
[53:32] with all our soul, with all that's
[53:34] within us. And if there's anything that
[53:37] we've held back, Lord, we want to
[53:40] surrender that to because we want
[53:43] nothing between you, our savior. Lord, I

[56:32] while to see everybody in the
[56:33] congregation but God sees you and that's
[56:36] what's important. Amen. He knows where
[56:38] you are. He knows your address. He knows
[56:40] the desire in your heart. He knows what
[56:43] you've been talking about, what you've
[56:44] been thinking about, what you've been
[56:46] praying about. and he has the answer for
[56:49] your situation. Amen. I'd like you to
[56:51] turn with me to Joel chapter 2 and verse
[56:54] 23 for the scripture reading this
[56:56] morning. And uh also we will look at
[56:59] another passage in the book of Joel. But
[57:02] first verse 23 of chapter 2 keeping our
[57:05] theme in mind. Who art thou great
[57:07] mountain be you shall become a plain.
[57:11] Amen. For he shall bring forth a
[57:13] headstone crying grace, grace into it.
[57:17] So we're speaking on today the mountain
[57:19] movers. It's harvest time. So verse 23
[57:23] says, "Be glad then you children of
[57:25] Zion. Rejoice in the Lord your God, for
[57:29] he hath given you the former rain
[57:30] moderately, and he will come cause to
[57:32] come down for you the rain, the former
[57:35] rain, and the latter rain in the first
[57:37] month. And the floors shall be full of
[57:39] wheat, and the vat shall overflow with
[57:42] wine and oil. And I will restore to you
[57:44] the years that the locust has eaten, the
[57:47] cankerorm, the caterpillar, and the
[57:49] palmer worm, my great army, which I sent
[57:52] among you, and you shall eat in plenty,
[57:55] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[57:58] the Lord your God that hath dealt
[58:00] wondrously with you, and my people shall
[58:03] never be ashamed. and ye shall know that
[58:06] I'm in the midst of Israel, and that I
[58:08] am the Lord your God, and none else, and
[58:11] my people shall never be ashamed." And
[58:14] this is then quoted by Peter on the day
[58:16] of Pentecost. And it shall come to pass
[58:18] afterwards that I will pour out my
[58:21] spirit upon all flesh. And your sons and
[58:24] your daughters shall prophesy. Your old
[58:27] men shall dream dreams. Your young men
[58:29] shall see visions. And also upon the
[58:32] servants, and upon the handmmaids in
[58:34] those days will I pour out my spirit.
[58:37] And I will show wonders in the heavens
[58:40] and in the earth blood and fire and
[58:42] pillars of smoke. The sun shall be
[58:45] turned into darkness, the moon into
[58:46] blood, before the great and terrible day
[58:49] of the Lord come. And it shall come to
[58:52] pass that whosoever shall call on the
[58:54] name of the Lord shall be delivered. For
[58:56] in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be
[58:59] deliverance, as the Lord has said, and
[59:02] in the remnant whom the Lord shall call.
[59:05] Then turn to the next chapter in Joel
[59:07] 3:E 13. put you in the sickle, for the
[59:12] harvest is ripe. Come get you down, for
[59:15] the press is full, the fats overflow,
[59:18] for their wickedness is great.
[59:21] Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of
[59:23] decision. For the day of the Lord is
[59:26] near in the valley of decision. The sun
[59:29] and the moon shall be darkened, and the
[59:32] stars shall withdraw their shining. The
[59:35] Lord also shall roar out of Zion and
[59:38] utter his voice from Jerusalem, and the
[59:41] heavens and the earth shall shake. But
[59:44] the Lord will be the hope of his people,
[59:47] and the strength of the children of
[59:48] Israel. So shall you know that I am the
[59:51] Lord your God, dwelling in Zion, my holy
[59:55] mountain. And then shall Jerusalem be
[59:58] holy, and there shall be no strangers
[1:00:01] pass through her anymore. God bless you.
[1:00:05] You can have your seats.
[1:00:08] It's harvest time
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; and at harvest time there is a ripeness
[1:00:13] of the grain. There's full maturity
[1:00:17] and it is time to put in the sickle as
[1:00:20] we read from Joel 3:13.
[1:00:24] Put you in the sickle for the harvest is
[1:00:27] ripe. You see the grain must reach full
[1:00:30] maturity before it can be harvested. And
[1:00:33] we are in the age of the finished cycle.
[1:00:37] And the bride has become has come back
[1:00:40] to the full word again. Restored to the
[1:00:43] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:00:46] saints.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; And it's not just by letter only, but in
[1:00:50] demonstration. As we say, the the wheat
[1:00:53] is no longer in the green stage of the
[1:00:55] the blade, the tusel or the shuck, but
[1:00:59] it's the grain. It's the life has now
[1:01:02] returned to the original. And the bride
[1:01:05] of course must reflect the word image of
[1:01:08] Christ, not a denomination or a creed.
[1:01:11] But it's it's maturity that is here.
[1:01:14] See, the bride is a ripened grain that
[1:01:17] was planted at Pentecost. If you'll look
[1:01:21] with me to Revelation 14:E1 14 and I
[1:01:25] want to look at a very profound
[1:01:27] scripture that means more and more to me
[1:01:29] in this as we continue at thinking of
[1:01:32] this harvest cycle. And he said, "And I
[1:01:34] looked and behold a white cloud and upon
[1:01:37] that cloud one like unto the son of man
[1:01:40] having on his head a golden crown and
[1:01:44] his hand a sharp sickle." And another
[1:01:47] angel came out of the temple, crying
[1:01:49] with a loud voice to him that sat on the
[1:01:51] cloud, "Thrust in thy sickle, and reap,
[1:01:55] for the time is come for thee to reap,
[1:01:58] for the harvest of the earth is ripe."
[1:02:02] Here to me is one of the most glorious
[1:02:04] and solemn prophetic scenes in all the
[1:02:07] scripture. Notice it is the son of man
[1:02:10] himself that is crowned with gold and
[1:02:13] he's seated upon a cloud of glory
[1:02:16] holding in his hand a sharp sickle and
[1:02:19] he's ready to reap the earth. It is both
[1:02:22] majestic and fearful. The the it's the
[1:02:26] moment of final separation. It's the
[1:02:29] hour of righteous reckoning. It's the
[1:02:32] culmination of divine suffering. As I as
[1:02:36] I think just for a moment, um, yesterday
[1:02:39] we committed the ashes of my wife's
[1:02:42] brother Rodney into the ground. And I I
[1:02:46] thought about how that the long wait of
[1:02:49] the Lord's return has made it where
[1:02:52] another was planted in the soil. And as
[1:02:55] I have often said through the years, you
[1:02:58] say, "Brother Tim, you preached the
[1:03:00] coming of the Lord for years now." And I
[1:03:02] certainly have. And he's come for many.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; And he came for Rodney. And he came
[1:03:08] suddenly. And even today, we look
[1:03:11] forward to him thrusting in the sickle
[1:03:14] and harvesting the saints of the New
[1:03:17] Testament. Even as Jesus resurrected the
[1:03:20] Old Testament saints when he
[1:03:23] resurrected. But oh, how long God has
[1:03:27] been. instead of taking the first wheat
[1:03:31] sheath at of grain at Pentecost that
[1:03:34] ripened 2,000 years ago, cuz I believe
[1:03:37] God had a church there that was without
[1:03:40] a spot or wrinkle.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; I believe that it was a mature church,
[1:03:44] but instead of taking her immediately
[1:03:46] into glory, he planted it.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; He planted it. He swed it in the earth
[1:03:51] as a seed so that a full harvest could
[1:03:54] come forth. And that first grain, Christ
[1:03:58] in the early bride, was was not plucked
[1:04:01] up prematurely, but it was planted in
[1:04:04] faith that through the seven ages of
[1:04:07] trial, persecution, and testing, a
[1:04:10] ripened bride would come to maturity.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; As John 20 12:24 says, "Except a corn of
[1:04:18] wheat fall into the ground and die, it
[1:04:21] abideth alone. But if it die, it
[1:04:24] bringeth forth much fruit.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; And I believe that's what God has done
[1:04:28] in in this season of where he planted on
[1:04:32] the day of Pentecost. And now he's
[1:04:34] bringing forth a crop, a righteous crop,
[1:04:37] a bride that will be in his image,
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; a people that is called for his name.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; And what may seem like delay has only
[1:04:47] been God's mercy.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; It has been his determined patience. And
[1:04:52] the the Apostle Peter reminds us in
[1:04:54] second Peter 3:9, the Lord is not slack
[1:04:57] concerning his promise, but he's
[1:05:00] longsuffering to usward that that not
[1:05:03] willing that any should perish, but that
[1:05:06] all should come to repentance. I'll tell
[1:05:09] you, we serve a merciful God.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; For he, you see, before the world began,
[1:05:16] he planned your coming. He knew you
[1:05:19] would be here. He wrote your name in the
[1:05:22] lamb's book of life. And every name
[1:05:25] written in the lamb's book of life,
[1:05:27] written before the foundation of the
[1:05:29] world, must be born.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; It must live. It must be manifested. And
[1:05:34] above all, it must be redeemed.
[1:05:37] And the husband waits for the precious
[1:05:40] fruit of the earth, refusing to thrust
[1:05:44] in the sickle until every last grain has
[1:05:48] appeared in its season.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; No wonder then he would store up the
[1:05:52] prayers of of even the apostle John when
[1:05:56] he would pray the last prayer saying
[1:05:58] even so come Lord Jesus. Yes.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; And he would wait and wait and wait,
[1:06:03] ages upon ages upon ages because your
[1:06:06] name was in the book, too.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; God's waiting till the last member of
[1:06:12] the body has come in and then the
[1:06:15] rapture will come.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; For seven ages, he has watched over his
[1:06:21] crop. He's watered. He's pruned. He's
[1:06:25] separated. He's restored. But you know
[1:06:28] now we we have come to the climax of the
[1:06:31] ages and I want to tell you the harvest
[1:06:34] is ripe
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; and the time has come to reap and what a
[1:06:40] harvest that will be.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in this moment oh he will
[1:06:45] harvest both the sleeping saints and the
[1:06:48] living bride. The dead in Christ shall
[1:06:51] rise first. And we who are alive and
[1:06:53] remain shall be caught up together to
[1:06:55] meet the Lord in the air. And this is
[1:06:58] the great in gathering, the longawwaited
[1:07:01] reunion of the redeemed.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. The harvest the Bible said is the
[1:07:08] end of the world.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said he would gather the
[1:07:11] wheat into the garner. And this is not
[1:07:14] just the end of an age. It's the
[1:07:16] beginning of eternity for the bride. So
[1:07:19] therefore, we see an hour where it's the
[1:07:22] ending of time and the blending of
[1:07:24] eternity. And and and of course, it
[1:07:26] makes it harvest time. It's raptured
[1:07:29] hour. It's bride time. It's the final
[1:07:32] cycle when the marriage of the lamb is
[1:07:34] at hand.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; She hath made herself ready. She's been
[1:07:39] ripened by the sun. She's been sealed by
[1:07:42] the spirit. She'd been separated from
[1:07:44] the tears. And now she's gathered for
[1:07:47] glory.
[1:07:48] What an hour we're living in.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; What a jade we are. When the sickle is
[1:07:53] in his hand.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where the cloud is already formed.
[1:07:59] Where the call has gone out.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Where the time has come. Thrust in thy
[1:08:04] sickle and reap.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; It's the time of harvest. It's the time
[1:08:08] of separation. And it's the time of
[1:08:11] gathering the wheat into the barn.
[1:08:14] Harvest time is rapture time. Amen.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So again, we want to think of this
[1:08:20] as we have read from Revelation 14:14.
[1:08:23] And he says, "Behold, a white cloud."
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Think of that. He cometh in clouds of
[1:08:29] glory. Clouds in the book of Revelation
[1:08:32] don't refer to thunderheads. It doesn't
[1:08:35] refer to atmospheric weather patterns.
[1:08:38] It's a Revelation is a book of symbols.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; And these clouds are glory clouds. They
[1:08:45] are not storm clouds.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. They are signs of his divine
[1:08:49] presence. Just like on the mount of
[1:08:52] transfiguration where Jesus countenance
[1:08:54] was altered and his garments glistened
[1:08:57] and a cloud overshadowed them. That was
[1:09:00] not a storm. It was the shina glory of
[1:09:04] God coming down.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Revelation 1:14 said his eyes
[1:09:10] are as a flame of fire. Yes. She
[1:09:12] describes him again, not in loneliness,
[1:09:15] but as a judge with eyes with flames of
[1:09:18] fire.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; I want to think I want you to think of
[1:09:20] it right now. Those eyes that was once
[1:09:23] dimmed in sorrow with tears of sorrow.
[1:09:28] Eyes that wept at the grave of Lazarus,
[1:09:31] that looked on compassion with at the
[1:09:33] multitude, the crippled, the halt, the
[1:09:35] blind. Amen. That that forgave the very
[1:09:38] ones that were nailing him to the tree.
[1:09:41] Now they burn with fire.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; The eyes that once wept now blaze with
[1:09:47] the fury of divine justice. He once said
[1:09:50] upon the cross, "Father, forgive them."
[1:09:53] And now it has become in righteousness.
[1:09:57] He doth judge and make war as he thrust
[1:10:00] in the sickle.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what God is doing. The man
[1:10:04] of sorrows now becomes crowned as the
[1:10:07] judge
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; as he separates the wicked from the
[1:10:12] righteous.
[1:10:14] Now throughout his early ministry we
[1:10:17] know Jesus wept. He showed his humanity.
[1:10:20] He was all God yet he was man.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; He was a man of sorrows acquainted with
[1:10:26] grief. But even behind those tears he
[1:10:30] was still God.
[1:10:32] seeing all, knowing all, judging
[1:10:34] righteously. And he said in John 8:24,
[1:10:36] "If you believe not, I am he, you will
[1:10:39] die in your sins."
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; He says in John 10:37 and 8, "If I do
[1:10:45] not the works of my father, believe me
[1:10:47] not." And like Jeremiah, he was the
[1:10:50] weeping prophet, for his own received
[1:10:53] him not. But now the time of weeping has
[1:10:56] passed. Now his eyes are as a flame of
[1:11:00] fire searching, exposing, discerning.
[1:11:04] Amen. Hebrews 4:13 said, "All things are
[1:11:07] naked and open to the the eyes of him
[1:11:10] with whom we have to do." For he's the
[1:11:13] one whom we are accountable to.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Even now those eyes are scanning the
[1:11:18] earth. No one ever thought, knowing your
[1:11:21] motive.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every hidden deed, nothing is
[1:11:25] veiled from his gaze. No sin is hidden
[1:11:29] from him. Even every evil thought is
[1:11:32] exposed.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my, he knows what's in your closet.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; He knows the things you are hiding in
[1:11:40] your life. And I want you to know the
[1:11:42] day of mercy is now drawing to a close.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; The books are open. The judge is
[1:11:48] standing at the door. Behold, he cometh
[1:11:50] with clouds.
[1:11:53] Not storm clouds,
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; but glory clouds.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; The cloud that he comes in, as I said,
[1:11:59] is not a thunderhead.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; It's wave after wave of his glorious
[1:12:04] presence.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Notice it's a pouring out of his spirit.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wave after wave of it.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Just as on the mount when the cloud of
[1:12:16] enveloped him. So again, he comes in the
[1:12:19] cloud of glory as he says in in
[1:12:22] Revelation 1:7, he cometh with cloud.
[1:12:26] This is the glory of his peruia, the
[1:12:29] glory of his presence spreading across
[1:12:32] the earth in waves of resurrection
[1:12:35] power.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Spirit that once lived in
[1:12:38] the hearts of saints now is calling
[1:12:41] their bodies from the earth.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Tears that dried on their cheeks, bodies
[1:12:48] that lowered into the ground in sorrow.
[1:12:51] But now the same spirit that raised up
[1:12:54] Jesus from the dead now quickens them.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4:16 prophesies, "And
[1:13:01] the dead in Christ shall rise first."
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Wave after wave after wave of his glory.
[1:13:09] The order of the resurrection.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:12] Let me talk about it for a moment
[1:13:15] because what a glorious mystery.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Yet it is wrapped in the wisdom of God.
[1:13:20] Yet to man is hidden right in plain
[1:13:22] sight.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; The Bible said in Matthew 2:16, "So the
[1:13:27] last shall be first and the first shall
[1:13:31] be last."
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Think of that.
[1:13:36] Now apply that to the resurrection.
[1:13:38] Those that went down last will be the
[1:13:41] first to come up.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; And those that went down first will be
[1:13:45] the last to come up.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; So how can this be? This is no ordinary
[1:13:51] resurrection. It's a divine order of the
[1:13:53] harvest. It's the sequence of glory that
[1:13:57] only God himself could orchestrate.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Think of what I'm talking about. Each
[1:14:02] each generation will will rise in its
[1:14:05] appointed time in its prophetic order as
[1:14:08] the great harvest of the ages unfolds.
[1:14:12] Let's get a glimpse of it. I mean, as
[1:14:15] brother Bradom said it, he said, "I I'll
[1:14:17] know those of my time, none, but not
[1:14:20] before or after, but those I ran the
[1:14:23] race with. My father will will rise with
[1:14:26] his generation, his father with his." So
[1:14:30] each will come in divine sequence wave
[1:14:33] after wave after wave until the whole
[1:14:36] bride of the seven ages will stand
[1:14:40] together complete united and immortal.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a day that will be.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Think of it. Seven voices, seven
[1:14:50] thunders, one resurrection symphony.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. The living saints changed in a
[1:14:57] moment in the twinkling of an eye will
[1:15:00] will sound that call. Amen. Like the
[1:15:04] thunder, the sound of thunder from
[1:15:06] heaven, the voice that is in the bride
[1:15:09] awaken in the age before them. Think of
[1:15:12] what I'm saying. From Leodosa, the call
[1:15:15] will echo back through time. And Leodysa
[1:15:19] will call Philadelphia. And Philadelphia
[1:15:22] will rise with the Methodist and the and
[1:15:24] Wesley and those shouting Methodist
[1:15:26] there. Oh, and then Wesley will stir
[1:15:30] Luther and Luther then will cry out to
[1:15:33] Columba and Columba will reach a hand
[1:15:36] out to Irene and Irene will shout out to
[1:15:39] Paul, Peter, James and John and Steven.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Seven voices, seven
[1:15:46] thunders, seven church ages awakening in
[1:15:50] divine sequence.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; What do you mean thunders, brother Tim?
[1:15:54] Voice of God.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Each calling his brethren from the voice
[1:15:58] from the dust of the earth.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; The Lord himself shall descend from
[1:16:03] heaven with a shout.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. With a trump of God, with the
[1:16:07] voice of the archangel, and the dead in
[1:16:10] Christ shall rise first. If you believe
[1:16:13] it, say
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a resurrection it'll be.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Not just bones rattling back to life,
[1:16:20] but the bride rising, full of life, full
[1:16:24] of life, full of glory, dressed in
[1:16:26] immortality.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. No one, no one will come out of
[1:16:32] the grave and rides of mortality.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; No one will wear the scars of sickness
[1:16:39] or the garments of sorrow.
[1:16:42] Amen.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Each saint will rise clothed in their
[1:16:46] theophony,
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; reunited with their glorified body,
[1:16:50] robed in pure white, wedding garments.
[1:16:54] Oh my, spotlessness, radiant, prepared
[1:16:57] to meet the bridegroom. Amen. For the
[1:17:00] Bible said it was granted for her to be
[1:17:02] arrayed in fine linen, clean and white.
[1:17:05] For the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:17:07] of the saints.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. will not rise. Think of this.
[1:17:12] We'll not rise with canes,
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; wheelchairs, or weary size,
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; but with shouts of joy,
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; with youthful and strong, alive forever
[1:17:24] more.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Think of it. There won't be a
[1:17:27] blind man tapping along with his cane.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. For all will see with a better and
[1:17:33] a superior vision than what we have now.
[1:17:36] And there won't be one on
[1:17:38] Hallelujah Square.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm looking forward to that
[1:17:43] time where the lame will will run for
[1:17:46] joy and leap for joy. Where the blind
[1:17:48] will see. Where there be no sickness, no
[1:17:51] death, no sorrow, no pain, no
[1:17:54] separation, no sin, no unbelief. All
[1:17:57] gone forever. Joy.
[1:18:04] What a reunion.
[1:18:06] I say what a reunion.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom talks about it. He says
[1:18:12] he said in in a month or so we'll be
[1:18:15] gone after the saints rise. But let me
[1:18:19] just put it in scriptural perspective.
[1:18:22] Just as Jesus lingered 40 days after his
[1:18:26] resurrection to walk, talk, and eat with
[1:18:29] his disciples.
[1:18:31] So shall the resurrected saints dwell
[1:18:34] again with the living bride
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; right here
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; before the rapture.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; After the resurrection,
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; there's going to be a gathering.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; The living bride will gather with the
[1:18:49] resurrected saints.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We will embrace.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; We will sing.
[1:18:58] I'm sure there's going to be some
[1:18:59] shouting
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; and some dancing and not a shadow of
[1:19:03] death. Nowhere.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; No more pain, no more trials,
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; no more goodbyes.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just life. Real life.
[1:19:15] Eternal life. Face to face with those we
[1:19:19] love marching together to meet the Lord
[1:19:22] in the air under the banner of the
[1:19:24] message of our age.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Wow. a procession.
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; And so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; And God shall wipe away all tears from
[1:19:42] their eyes.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; This is the word of God. Is the divine
[1:19:48] promise for the harvest time.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; It will be home at last.
[1:19:58] Oh my.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Now, this world really isn't my home.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah, the earth is. We'll come back and
[1:20:05] dwell on it.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; But this old world that we live in, the
[1:20:09] cosmos and the evil age is not our home.
[1:20:12] We don't feel at home here. We realize
[1:20:14] we're citizens of another land.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; But what began as a whisper in Eden ends
[1:20:20] with a shout from heaven.
[1:20:23] What started with seeds sown ends with a
[1:20:26] harvest.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; What was sown in weakness raises up in
[1:20:31] power. I'm quoting you scripture. What
[1:20:34] was failed in mystery is revealed in
[1:20:37] glory. And this is not a fantasy of
[1:20:39] emotion. This is a sure word of prophecy
[1:20:43] that's made real by the hour. Amen. This
[1:20:47] is the age of the final call. It is the
[1:20:50] rapture call. It's the harvest cry. It's
[1:20:52] resurrection time. And I want to say
[1:20:55] friends, it's rejoicing time.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; It's homegoing time.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said in Revelation 20 and
[1:21:02] 6, blessed and holy is he that have part
[1:21:05] in the first resurrection.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; There's somebody going to have a part
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; in that resurrection.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; But all that men would repent.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The judge is coming and he's
[1:21:18] coming in clouds of glory. Not just to
[1:21:21] rescue, but to reckon.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Not only to bless, but to separate. And
[1:21:27] that's why every heart should take heed.
[1:21:30] For the Bible said in 1 Peter 2 4:17,
[1:21:33] for the time has come that judgment must
[1:21:36] begin at the house of God.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Judgment begins in God's house.
[1:21:48] This is where separation takes place
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; in God's house.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not just talking about
[1:21:57] separating that man. I think's a terror.
[1:21:59] That woman, I'm sure, is a a shook.
[1:22:03] I'm not talking about that. I'm talking
[1:22:05] about separation from unbelief,
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; sin, doubt,
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; confusion.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Right now, there's a
[1:22:13] separation take place and judgment
[1:22:16] begins at the house of God.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; So, let that ring in every soul like a
[1:22:21] trumpet blast in the midnight hour. Cuz
[1:22:24] this is not the hour of delay. It's the
[1:22:26] hour of decision.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The judgment's already began, not
[1:22:31] in the world, but in God's house.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand it starts with
[1:22:36] God's house first.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:38] You see, there's a spiritual earthquake
[1:22:42] before a natural one.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; What do you mean, brother Tim? Well,
[1:22:46] let's let's let's take in mind and view
[1:22:49] the the sixth seal in the the book of
[1:22:52] Revelation where the sixth seal opens
[1:22:55] with a mighty earthquake.
[1:22:58] And of course, we know his judgments are
[1:23:00] waiting to be poured out in the physical
[1:23:02] judgments. But all but a but already the
[1:23:06] the spiritual shaking has begun. First
[1:23:10] in the spirit. An unseen quake rumbles
[1:23:14] through the religious world. And before
[1:23:17] the earth reels with convulsions. The
[1:23:20] heavens are already shaken.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And everything that can be shaken
[1:23:26] is being shaken.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Traditions are being uprooted.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tears are being separated. The
[1:23:34] chaff is being cast out. The fan is in
[1:23:37] his hand. And he will thoroughly purge
[1:23:40] his floor.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; The blade, the tole, the even the shuck.
[1:23:46] They were the stages of former former
[1:23:49] glory. It's where the spirit of God was
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; but left. That's right.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Think of that. Places where life once
[1:24:00] was have now withered and died.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; I think of this. How many people, how
[1:24:08] many churches? Yeah. Even individuals
[1:24:12] life was once there.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; But it's gone.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; What once carried life has refused to
[1:24:21] move forward.
[1:24:23] I want you to understand I don't care
[1:24:26] how green you used to be and moving with
[1:24:29] life.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; I don't care how you used to rejoice
[1:24:33] when the rain fell and move in the
[1:24:35] spirit with the spirit and as this wind
[1:24:38] blew through your leaves.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; You see, you must go forward.
[1:24:45] And if you refuse to move forward, you
[1:24:48] actually reject to become the full
[1:24:51] maturity of the word. You must keep
[1:24:53] progressing.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Ed walked with God.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Don't get comfortable on your pew.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't just get comfortable where
[1:25:03] you are in the station you are right
[1:25:06] now. It's time to move forward.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; It's time to move upward.
[1:25:14] Jesus said, "Every plant which my father
[1:25:17] hath not planted shall be rooted up."
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; This is a spiritual replay of Genesis
[1:25:24] 21. We're seeing it unfold before our
[1:25:26] eyes. That of Hagar and Ishmamail, the
[1:25:30] bonds woman and her son. The religious
[1:25:33] system and the law bound offspring.
[1:25:37] They're cast out.
[1:25:40] Ishmael, born of the flesh, laughed in
[1:25:43] mockery at at Isaac, the child of the
[1:25:45] promise. He laughed at the miraculous.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; He laughed at God's vision and God's
[1:25:52] purpose.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; And God declared in in Galatians 4:30,
[1:25:57] "Cast out the bond woman and her son,
[1:26:00] for the son of the bond woman shall not
[1:26:02] be heir with the son of the free woman."
[1:26:05] Let me tell you for some friends,
[1:26:07] denominational offspring,
[1:26:10] let me just say this. Those that are
[1:26:12] just warmers,
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; lukewarm, formal, starchy, who cling to
[1:26:19] form without power, ritual without
[1:26:21] revelation, will not be heirs with the
[1:26:24] bride.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Their mockery of the promised word, the
[1:26:28] refusal to walk in the revealed truth of
[1:26:30] the hour, it seals their fate. They will
[1:26:34] not go in the rapture. They're cast into
[1:26:36] the tribulation.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; That's what happens at harvest time.
[1:26:39] There's a separation. But I want to say,
[1:26:42] yeah, we look there at at Hagar and and
[1:26:45] Ishmamail and they're casting out. But I
[1:26:47] want you to get an eye who who is this
[1:26:50] other woman? Who is this woman that's
[1:26:54] arrayed in glory? who is not clothed in
[1:26:57] the sackcloth of denominational bondage
[1:27:00] but in fine linen clean and white. Who
[1:27:03] is that woman? Why? It's Sarah. Amen. No
[1:27:07] longer laughing in unbelief,
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; but laughing at joy at the fulfillment.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, that tells you there's mercy
[1:27:15] and hope for many of us who once laughed
[1:27:18] at the promise, who once was unable to
[1:27:20] believe, but God turned our hearts back
[1:27:23] to faith again. and that God is here
[1:27:25] this morning to turn your heart back to
[1:27:28] believing again.
[1:27:35] She has received strength to conceive.
[1:27:38] She's bringing forth the manifested
[1:27:40] sons,
[1:27:42] the Isaac generation, the promised seed,
[1:27:45] the word bride. She's not to be planted
[1:27:48] again. No, this is not another
[1:27:50] Pentecost. No, this is harvest time.
[1:27:53] Pentecost was the planting.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; This is harvest. She had made herself
[1:27:59] ready.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, this we're
[1:28:05] witnessing is not a reformation.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; No, we're witnessing separation.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; The last move is not the forming of
[1:28:14] another blade. It's not the making of
[1:28:17] another denomination. is not about
[1:28:20] kingdom building or or or man-made
[1:28:23] system, but it's the gathering of the
[1:28:26] grain.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; You see, Matthew 13:30 said, "Let's both
[1:28:31] grow together until the harvest." You
[1:28:34] know what that means? It means now at
[1:28:37] harvest time, the time of toleration is
[1:28:40] passed.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; There's a line that is drawn.
[1:28:44] The wheat must now be gathered into the
[1:28:46] garner, and the tears burn with fire.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; And the Son of Man is now winnowing his
[1:28:53] floor. The fan is in his hand, and only
[1:28:56] the grain, listen to me, only the grain,
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; will be caught away. But oh, I remember,
[1:29:04] Brother Tim, 40 years ago, God moved in
[1:29:06] my life. Where's the grain? And where is
[1:29:09] the the life now?
[1:29:12] Oh, I remember at a camp meeting. I had
[1:29:15] it. But well, why are you dying? Why are
[1:29:17] you drying up?
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; How come you're not moving forward?
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I was justified by
[1:29:24] faith. I believed on the Lord Jesus
[1:29:26] Christ. My sins were forgiven." Well,
[1:29:28] why don't you let him sanctify your
[1:29:29] life?
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Well, he sanctified me, Brother Tim, and
[1:29:33] took habits out of my life. Why don't
[1:29:34] you let him fill you with the Holy
[1:29:36] Ghost?
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you let it bubble over
[1:29:40] until it spills over everywhere around
[1:29:43] you that everybody can see? You're a
[1:29:45] testimony of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; The son of man is winnowing his floor.
[1:29:53] And this is a warning and it's a wakeup
[1:29:55] call. So I'll tell you, we need to have
[1:29:58] every heart to take heed and listen
[1:30:00] close because God has turned again to
[1:30:04] the original. Not to start the cycle
[1:30:07] again, but to end it in a glorified
[1:30:10] harvest.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride has been called out.
[1:30:15] She's been justified and purified. And
[1:30:17] she's been lifted up into heavenly
[1:30:19] places. She rules with him.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a people that rules
[1:30:24] with him. Now,
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; yeah, we'll rule with him in the
[1:30:27] millennial kingdom, but right now, our
[1:30:29] dominion is over sin, over unbelief.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. It gives you a dominion over
[1:30:34] pornography. It gives you dominion over
[1:30:36] adultery. It gives you a dominion over
[1:30:39] fornication. It gives you dominion over
[1:30:42] dope and alcohol. It gives you dominion.
[1:30:44] It makes you to rule and reign with
[1:30:46] Christ
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; right now. Yeah.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Not in the sweet by and by. Although
[1:30:51] there will be the rain in the great
[1:30:53] millennial ahead. But right now we reign
[1:30:56] with him.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Right now we tell sickness to leave.
[1:30:59] Right now we rule over demonic kingdoms.
[1:31:02] Right now we have power over the flesh.
[1:31:05] Right now
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; I'm talking to a people that are both
[1:31:11] kings and priests
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; unto their God.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. lifted up in the heavenly places.
[1:31:19] But the time of the bondwoman's dominion
[1:31:22] is over. Her child is a wild man
[1:31:27] rebellious to the word shall not
[1:31:29] inherit. And this is the final
[1:31:32] fulfillment of Genesis 4. We are not the
[1:31:35] children of or Galatians 4. We're not
[1:31:38] the children of the bond woman but of
[1:31:40] the free.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, the last grain is brought
[1:31:46] to maturity.
[1:31:48] The last name is being sealed in. That's
[1:31:52] what the Holy Spirit is doing. Finally,
[1:31:54] that last name on the book to what? Seal
[1:31:59] them in.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; And the last call is echoing across the
[1:32:04] bride's heart.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the and and the last cry out
[1:32:11] of Babylon is sounding clearer than ever
[1:32:14] before that says, "Come out of her, my
[1:32:16] people, that you be not partakers of her
[1:32:19] sin and receive not of her plagues."
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to escape the
[1:32:23] tribulation ahead. They're going to
[1:32:25] listen to the voice of God and come out.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; I tell you, church, listen to it. Hear
[1:32:30] it. Bride, rise in it. It's not a time
[1:32:33] to blend in with man's systems and man's
[1:32:36] creeds. It is not the hour of covenant
[1:32:39] mise. It's not the hour of ecumenism.
[1:32:41] It's not the hour to take the mind of
[1:32:43] the world. It's the hour to take on the
[1:32:45] mind of Christ.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; This is the hour to stand with the
[1:32:49] eternal word
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; and oh that men would repent now.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Today is the day of salvation
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; while mercy still pleads.
[1:33:01] Oh, that they would make his bosom their
[1:33:03] pillow before the world dissolves in
[1:33:06] fire and the day of vengeance begins.
[1:33:10] But listen, there's waves of glory that
[1:33:13] sweeping the earth right now.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Waves of resurrection power that are
[1:33:19] going across the earth right now as God
[1:33:22] pours out his spirit. Oh, I pray that
[1:33:25] you'll feel it waving through us this
[1:33:26] morning.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I pray there not be a service
[1:33:29] that we're void of his spirit.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; That we don't feel his wind blow.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. That the Holy Spirit doesn't sweep
[1:33:36] in and push sin and out and and drive
[1:33:40] away the the shock.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Separate from me God the chaff in
[1:33:46] my life. Yes.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; He cometh in clouds, not under heads of
[1:33:52] judgment alone, but clouds of glory with
[1:33:54] waves upon wave upon wave of his divine
[1:33:59] presence.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Rolling across the earth like the breath
[1:34:02] of heaven.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; These are not empty clouds. These are
[1:34:07] not clouds without rain.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; These are not something that's a false
[1:34:11] promise. Amen. These are spirit charged
[1:34:14] atmospheres carrying the very life that
[1:34:17] raised Jesus from the dead. I'm telling
[1:34:19] you that atmosphere is now coming into
[1:34:22] the church.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. The spirit charged atmosphere
[1:34:27] carrying the life that raised Jesus from
[1:34:30] the dead is now coming into the church.
[1:34:33] And I say, "Fill me with it, God. Fill
[1:34:36] this assembly with it."
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let dead men live.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "If the spirit that
[1:34:48] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:34:50] you, he that raised up Christ from the
[1:34:52] dead shall make alive, quicken
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; your mortal body," I wonder if it could
[1:34:58] quicken you enough to lift your hand to
[1:35:00] God in worship.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I wonder if it could quicken
[1:35:04] you enough to shout out an amen to God.
[1:35:08] I wonder if it can move and clouds the
[1:35:11] joy of the Lord, which is your strength
[1:35:13] to rise up within you and cry out
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; for his harvest time. It's a harvest
[1:35:21] time where the now he is thrust in the
[1:35:24] sickle.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The resurrection life is not only
[1:35:29] reserved for the last day. Uh-uh. It's
[1:35:32] already moving.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you, it's already
[1:35:36] moving. It's already flowing in waves of
[1:35:39] power to awaken those dead in sin, to
[1:35:41] quicken the bride, to and to shake the
[1:35:44] living and the dead.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, let me tell you
[1:35:49] with assurance,
[1:35:51] this resurrection power that you feel
[1:35:53] this morning is a very resurrection
[1:35:55] power that will raise those that are
[1:35:58] dead in the grave.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something else. It
[1:36:02] will also raise those that are dead in
[1:36:04] the spirit.
[1:36:08] Hallelujah. It's not just those out in
[1:36:10] the graveyard that needs raising.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; There's some right here in this church.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; That needs a resurrection.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before the trumpet blast and the
[1:36:21] graves break open, there must be a
[1:36:23] resurrection of the soul.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Think about what I'm talking about. The
[1:36:28] Bible said in in Ephesians 2 and one,
[1:36:30] "And you hath he quickened." That means
[1:36:34] made alive. I'm looking at men and women
[1:36:37] here today that I can say, "And you
[1:36:39] heath made alive. And you heath made
[1:36:41] alive. And you heath quickened. You who
[1:36:44] were once dead in sins and trespasses
[1:36:48] are now alive."
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:54] What is this quickening? It's
[1:36:56] resurrection.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Come forth.
[1:37:00] Come forth. That is the voice that still
[1:37:04] calls the dead to life.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; It's the same voice, the eternal
[1:37:09] commanding voice that stood outside the
[1:37:13] tomb of Lazarus and cried, "Lazarus,
[1:37:17] come forth." I want you to know his
[1:37:19] voice is still in the church today.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And even here, this is where dead
[1:37:25] men come alive.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That same voice is now
[1:37:31] echoing, you know, across the ages, not
[1:37:34] in the stone tombs or but in the tombs
[1:37:37] of human hearts.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Hearts that were shrouded in grave
[1:37:42] clothes of sin and bounds and cords of
[1:37:45] religion. Men and women, boys and girls
[1:37:48] whose lives were slowly snuffed out by
[1:37:51] depression, fear, and unbelief. Amen.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; And now the winds of the spirit is
[1:37:56] moving across the church with
[1:37:58] resurrection life and bringing life.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Quickening souls. Let's say
[1:38:07] God quicken me this morning.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Pour out your spirit upon me. Make me
[1:38:12] alive in the spirit.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:18] They have entombmed been so many have
[1:38:21] been in tmbed in beautiful supplers of
[1:38:25] lifeless churches decorated with
[1:38:28] tradition but void of his presence
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; places where the spirit never moves
[1:38:35] bound by rituals or creeds and dogmas of
[1:38:38] men. They lie still and helpless and
[1:38:41] hopeless.
[1:38:43] But the word has come. I said the word
[1:38:46] has come
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; and this message declares with authority
[1:38:51] loose him and let him go.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the message
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; and now they rise that rise from
[1:39:00] dungeons of sin to the glorious liberty
[1:39:03] of Christ.
[1:39:05] Amen.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; How many can say, "I once was in sin
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; and dead and trespasses, but now I am
[1:39:15] alive and raised from that dungeon.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; I raised up out of the dungeon of
[1:39:22] despair where I was beaten day after day
[1:39:25] after day until I was lifeless by the
[1:39:28] dying of despair. But no longer am I
[1:39:31] under that depression. No longer am I
[1:39:34] ruled by that sin. No longer does
[1:39:36] unbelief control me. No longer I am
[1:39:39] alive. I've come out of the tomb.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can you say, "I've come out
[1:39:48] of that tomb. I've left sin behind. I've
[1:39:51] walked past his chains. I'm no longer
[1:39:54] bound."
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Others
[1:40:01] Others not in church pews
[1:40:04] but in gutters
[1:40:07] in the gutters chained by addiction.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Crushed by shame
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; living in death chambers of immorality
[1:40:14] and despair.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; They too have heard the call.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Drunkards, addicts, prostitutes, the
[1:40:22] suicidal and the broken. Oh yeah.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Men and women who were awaiting judgment
[1:40:27] in their own dark dungeon cells have
[1:40:30] heard the voice of mercy.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The door swung open. Jesus
[1:40:37] signed their pardon.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; The chains fell off.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; The king's pardon was read aloud by the
[1:40:43] power of the gospel. I'm reading it
[1:40:45] aloud to you today. Let me proclaim it
[1:40:48] to you. He who the son hath made free is
[1:40:51] free indeed. Then fast in the liberty
[1:40:54] where Christ had made you free and never
[1:40:57] never never be entangled again with the
[1:40:59] yoke of bondage.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:06] Out of Egypt we have come and into the
[1:41:10] promise.
[1:41:11] Just like the sons of Jacob coming out
[1:41:14] of Egypt,
[1:41:16] they have thrown off their slave
[1:41:18] garments and left behind their old
[1:41:21] masters.
[1:41:23] their addictions, their habits, their
[1:41:25] tormentors, those former task masters of
[1:41:29] the soul lie dead in the sea of God's
[1:41:32] deliverance.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; And just as Israel sang a new song on
[1:41:36] the other side of the Red Sea, so do we
[1:41:40] lift our voice like Miriam did with the
[1:41:42] tambourine, singing the song of Moses
[1:41:45] and the lamb. Amen. She sang, "The Lord
[1:41:48] is my strength."
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. You said, "Brother Tim, I can't
[1:41:52] overcome. Neither could they."
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; They couldn't whip Egypt, but God could.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; He knew just how to do it.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; He took them right through the baptism
[1:42:02] of that Red Sea, and they all fell off.
[1:42:04] I tell you, if you ever get a baptism of
[1:42:07] the Holy Ghost in your life, your old
[1:42:09] taskmaster will drown. They can't follow
[1:42:12] through.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my strength. That's how I
[1:42:17] can overcome. And he's my song. and he
[1:42:20] hath become my salvation. The horse and
[1:42:22] his rider heath thrown into the sea.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; My enemies.
[1:42:30] My enemies. That pornography that
[1:42:32] polluted my spirit. A spirit of adultery
[1:42:35] that haunted me, that dope that
[1:42:37] destroyed me now lays in the sea.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; No wonder we can dance.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; No wonder we can shout. No wonder
[1:42:48] because it's victory.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. No, because our enemy lies dead in
[1:42:54] the sea of God's deliverance.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; How many has seen your enemies there?
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. No wonder then you can shout.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; No wonder you can rejoice with me today.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your enemy is dead.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; And guess what? You are alive. And that
[1:43:14] which sought to take your life could not
[1:43:17] do it because God had a predestinated
[1:43:20] plan for your life.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; And the long awaited harvest has come.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; God has waited long for this.
[1:43:36] The harvest of the redeemed.
[1:43:39] And he's not delayed out of
[1:43:40] indifference.
[1:43:42] He's not giving out of on his plan. He
[1:43:45] hadn't said, "Well, I'm just not able to
[1:43:47] get anybody to really believe me out of
[1:43:49] this backsliding age of Leodysia."
[1:43:52] But he delayed it because of
[1:43:55] longsuffering.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Not willing that any should perish,
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; but that all should come to repentance.
[1:44:07] And I want to say
[1:44:09] now from every corner of the earth souls
[1:44:13] are coming forth
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; called out of darkness into his
[1:44:17] marvelous light.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just you know forgive me for a
[1:44:24] moment if I get too personal but you
[1:44:26] just look what happened to James Tron.
[1:44:28] Took a drunk without a sober day since
[1:44:31] he was a young boy. And one moment,
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; not days and days of rehab, but the one
[1:44:38] moment
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; made a gentleman and a real Christian
[1:44:42] out of him.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; A man that was hopeless.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. A man that was lost
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; put God rich in mercy because there was
[1:44:54] a name on the book
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; that had to be redeemed. He delayed his
[1:44:59] coming so that he could get in. Amen.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Look what happened to Jason Dagard
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; drawn here all the way from Canada and
[1:45:09] no intention of serving God.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Look what happened to his precious
[1:45:13] daughter Alyssa back there. Same thing,
[1:45:17] you know, no intentions of serving God.
[1:45:19] Look at him now.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Look at him now.
[1:45:28] We ought to be able to see the before
[1:45:30] and after picture.
[1:45:32] Come on. But let me tell you, before
[1:45:34] that picture, before the sin, there was
[1:45:36] another picture that God took of them
[1:45:39] and had it in the lamb's book of life.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And every soul of God is
[1:45:45] going to match what he had in his mind
[1:45:47] before the world began. And I tell you,
[1:45:50] if you're not everything you ought to be
[1:45:52] yet, let me tell you, he will change you
[1:45:54] and change you until you match that
[1:45:56] book, he's not going to leave you alone.
[1:46:00] He'll deal with your heart. He'll work
[1:46:02] in your spirit. He'll speak to your
[1:46:04] life. He'll send servant after servant
[1:46:06] till he catches you and brings you in
[1:46:08] because he's a God rich in mercy
[1:46:11] [Applause]
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; who will not leave one lost sheep
[1:46:15] behind.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:20] Hallelujah.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Jason Taggard
[1:46:27] didn't come here to go to church.
[1:46:30] Did you Jason?
[1:46:32] Farthest thing from his mind?
[1:46:37] But he come one time too many.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; And while hearing the word preached
[1:46:48] The desire for cigarettes, the desire
[1:46:50] for alcohol, the desire for drugs left.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm giving you? I can give
[1:47:04] you many more. I can go through
[1:47:06] testimony after testimony. Amen. What
[1:47:09] I'm doing is giving you a few witnesses
[1:47:11] of the resurrection.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; The resurrection is among us.
[1:47:17] Joe Green, you know what I'm talking
[1:47:18] about. He's the resurrection and the
[1:47:20] life. He took you out of sin, drugs,
[1:47:22] alcohol, everything else. And wipe you
[1:47:25] clean. What is that? A God rich in
[1:47:27] mercy.
[1:47:29] A God who delayed
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; and held time of his coming back
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; so you could come in
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; cuz your name was on his book
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; who says I will not lose one of mine
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; and I don't care how wavered that girl
[1:47:54] is, that boy is.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. If their name is in God's book,
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; goodness and mercy is on their trail.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; The Bible said in Psalms 23, "Surely
[1:48:06] goodness and mercy
[1:48:09] will follow me all the days of my life."
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; That means to trail after, to chase
[1:48:14] after. Amen. To overtake and to finally
[1:48:18] get. Amen. This God is a God whose love
[1:48:21] will capture you. whose love is so great
[1:48:25] you cannot keep resisting
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; cuz he will find you and redeem you.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said in Matthew 24:14,
[1:48:41] "And the gospel of the kingdom shall be
[1:48:44] preached and all the world witness unto
[1:48:47] all nations,
[1:48:49] and then shall the end come.
[1:48:54] So what we are witnessing today is a
[1:48:56] global move of the message to every
[1:48:58] nation.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; We are in the time of Daniel where he
[1:49:02] says that you know that where where that
[1:49:06] he where he speaks of this being in the
[1:49:10] last day where where that where once
[1:49:14] again there is a global move of the
[1:49:17] message to every nation. And let me tell
[1:49:20] you, this is not a conversion of the
[1:49:22] whole world. A lot of times we think,
[1:49:24] well, we got to convert them all there
[1:49:26] and we got to convert them all there and
[1:49:27] we got to convert them all there. No,
[1:49:29] it's a witness.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; It must be priests in all the world for
[1:49:34] a witness.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; So the seed is being sown for the final
[1:49:40] time. The bride is being called out
[1:49:42] around the world. And the call is went
[1:49:45] out to every continent.
[1:49:48] No matter where you go, you know, even
[1:49:51] right now,
[1:49:53] um, even right now, Lord willing, God
[1:49:56] willing, next month, Bethany and Michael
[1:49:58] and I will take a trip into Iceland. And
[1:50:01] there we're not I'm not going to preach.
[1:50:03] It's just a a little vacation time.
[1:50:06] We're going to Iceland in August. And
[1:50:09] but already already there's already
[1:50:12] people who believe
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; that are there.
[1:50:19] You think sometimes, oh, blow blow Iran
[1:50:23] off the map. Do you know there are
[1:50:25] believers
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; in Iran?
[1:50:29] That's right.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Wipe Russia off the face of the earth.
[1:50:33] Do you know I communicate all the time
[1:50:35] with the church in Moscow.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Believers.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride has been called out
[1:50:44] around the world.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible said from every
[1:50:47] kindred, tongue, tribe, and nation. It
[1:50:50] don't matter what color, creed, or
[1:50:51] whatever you are.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You come under the banner of one
[1:50:55] message.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; And we're all filled with one blood. The
[1:51:00] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; So there is more. This is more than
[1:51:07] revival. This is resurrection.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; They've had revivals in times past, but
[1:51:14] this is more than revival.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; This is resurrection.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; This is not borrowed breath. This is the
[1:51:21] life of Christ surging through a once
[1:51:24] dead body.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; So let the graves of tradition burst
[1:51:29] open. Let the prison doors of sin swing
[1:51:32] wide. The voice of the son of God is
[1:51:35] speaking as in John 5:25. The hour is
[1:51:38] coming and now is when the dead shall
[1:51:41] hear the voice of the son of God and
[1:51:43] they that hear shall live.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; The dry bones dead dry bones of
[1:51:50] Ezekiel's valley
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; are hearing the word again.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; The spirit is blowing. Sue are forming.
[1:51:58] Flesh is returning. Breath is entering.
[1:52:01] and the first wave of resurrection.
[1:52:04] Souls that was once lifeless that are
[1:52:07] now filled with life.
[1:52:10] Dead minds now illuminated by the
[1:52:13] resurre re revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Wave after wave awakening the elect.
[1:52:21] And so this is not a single shout or or
[1:52:24] a momentary revival. This is wave after
[1:52:28] wave of his presence that is rolling
[1:52:31] across the bride tree. Behold, the Lord
[1:52:34] God will come with a strong hand, and he
[1:52:37] shall feed his flock like a shepherd,
[1:52:39] said Isaiah. One wave will touch a young
[1:52:42] man that's bound in pornography, and he
[1:52:45] drops his chain.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's all it takes.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. One spiritfilled meeting,
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; one place where the atmosphere gets
[1:52:55] charged. Yes.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where the cloud of glory comes
[1:52:58] down,
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; where the shikana expresses its power.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; And right there when that one wave of
[1:53:05] glory, a young man bound in pornography
[1:53:08] drops his chains,
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; another wave moves across the church and
[1:53:15] finds a cold dead church member.
[1:53:18] Amen. And suddenly a soul will weep
[1:53:21] under the conviction and the joy of
[1:53:23] salvation returns. I want you to know
[1:53:26] what that is. That's resurrection power.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. A third wave will reach out and
[1:53:33] and hit a prodical daughter and she runs
[1:53:36] back into the arms of her father.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me tell you, they don't
[1:53:41] even have to be in church for that to
[1:53:43] happen.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Just where you are, a testimony of that.
[1:53:48] It don't even have to be in church. One
[1:53:50] night in the prayer line, we was
[1:53:52] praying. his sister come said, "I want
[1:53:54] my brother serving God." And he was in
[1:53:56] all kinds of sin and and wickedness. But
[1:53:58] I'll tell you what, the Holy Spirit got
[1:54:00] a hold of him
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; before that prayer line ended. He was in
[1:54:04] the prayer line, too, in his pajamas.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Forever changed.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; A dead man came alive. I said a dead
[1:54:12] man. A dead man came alive. I'm telling
[1:54:16] you, that power is filling the church
[1:54:19] this morning. It'll raise the dead.
[1:54:22] It'll get you cold, backsliden, cold,
[1:54:25] and former church member and make you
[1:54:27] have resurrection power within you and
[1:54:30] you'll live
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; and glorify God.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Sorry, I've been teaching a while, so
[1:54:39] I'm preaching this morning.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; The bride as she begin to rise is not
[1:54:46] from cemeteries first.
[1:54:51] These are the thoughts I had on the way
[1:54:53] home yesterday.
[1:54:57] But the bride begins to rise
[1:55:00] not from the cemetery first, but from
[1:55:04] compromise,
[1:55:05] from lethargy,
[1:55:07] from lukewarmness,
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; from unbelief.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; The resurrections,
[1:55:14] these are the resurrections that begins
[1:55:17] before the rapture. And you can't go in
[1:55:20] this rapture without this resurrection.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; It happens first spiritually and then
[1:55:28] literally.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, let let us not forget the dead and
[1:55:32] Christ shall rise first.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; But there is a spiritual rising before
[1:55:36] the little one. Just as Jesus cried in
[1:55:39] the garden, not my will but thine be
[1:55:40] done and laid his life down. So the
[1:55:42] bride is laying down her own ambitions,
[1:55:45] her dead works, her cold formalism, her
[1:55:48] preconceived ideas. She's shedding the
[1:55:50] lifeless theology or theories rather of
[1:55:53] church theology. And she's rising in
[1:55:56] resurrection power. As Ephesians 5:14
[1:55:59] says, "Awake thou that sleepeth, and
[1:56:02] arise from the dead, and Christ shall
[1:56:04] give thee light." Amen.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; You see, it's actually a prophetic
[1:56:12] trumpet over the earth. You say,
[1:56:14] "Brother Tim, the trumpets are all the
[1:56:16] Israel." No, there's gospel trumpets
[1:56:18] that goes out to the bride and there's a
[1:56:21] prophetic trumpet sounding over the
[1:56:24] earth. It's the voice of the bridegroom
[1:56:26] calling the bride.
[1:56:29] This is the midnight cry. is not just a
[1:56:32] call to awaken the sleeping. But it's a
[1:56:34] call to the quicken, rise, shine, live,
[1:56:39] trim your lamps. Amen. The light has
[1:56:42] come. The glory of the Lord has risen
[1:56:44] upon you. So he says, "Thrust in the
[1:56:47] sickle and reap for the harvest of the
[1:56:50] earth is ripe."
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; So this is this is the harvest and it's
[1:56:57] the harvest of the grain from the fields
[1:56:59] of death.
[1:57:01] It's a church that's alive, ripening now
[1:57:05] in the presence of the sun. She is the
[1:57:08] first fruits of that resurrection power,
[1:57:11] a living bride. I ask you, what about
[1:57:14] you this morning? Has a resurrection
[1:57:17] power touched your life? Has sin been
[1:57:20] dealt with in your life? Have you felt
[1:57:22] that wave of glory strike your soul?
[1:57:26] Have you risen from your sinstained
[1:57:28] grave to walk in the newness of life?
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said, "I am the resurrection
[1:57:34] and the life. He that liveth and
[1:57:37] believeth in me shall never die."
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Believest thou this?
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; That's the question this morning.
[1:57:45] Believest thou this?
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That resurrection life is in the
[1:57:49] church.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wave after wave after wave is
[1:57:54] sweeping. Now
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; the question is not will there be a
[1:57:58] resurrection.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; The question is will you be in it?
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Will you see stones that don't come to
[1:58:05] life? It's the seed that is quickened.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Will you be in that resurrection? Will
[1:58:10] you let that resurrection power reach
[1:58:12] you?
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Will you let it go past the bitterness
[1:58:17] of your soul? that ought that you have
[1:58:20] against another that spirit where that
[1:58:23] you have now drawn up into a shell and
[1:58:26] you are now in a tomb and you have
[1:58:29] closed the stone. You see people don't
[1:58:32] have to close you in. You close your own
[1:58:34] self in and you withdraw into your own
[1:58:37] little shell until you will not move
[1:58:39] where the spirit moves.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you friend, every seed
[1:58:44] of God has to hear the voice of God. And
[1:58:46] when the voice of God cries out, it
[1:58:48] says, "Come alive.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Come out of the tomb."
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he can raise Lazarus, who was
[1:58:56] dead four days, he can I don't care how
[1:58:58] long you've been dead. He can raise you
[1:59:01] up.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; That's him this morning. Resurrection
[1:59:05] and life.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; And before the tombs of dirt are open,
[1:59:11] tombs of dead religion must first be
[1:59:14] shattered.
[1:59:18] Too long. I want to say it. Too long.
[1:59:22] And even it's now creeping right into
[1:59:24] our own churches.
[1:59:26] Too long. Men have sat in pews,
[1:59:29] embalmed in tradition,
[1:59:31] dressed in garments of formality,
[1:59:34] wrapped in grave clothes of man-made
[1:59:38] preconceived ideas and theology, lying
[1:59:42] behind stone doors sealed with man-made
[1:59:46] creeds.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; But I want to hear you. I want you to
[1:59:52] hear this this morning. Right now,
[1:59:54] there's a voice that's thundering from
[1:59:56] heaven and and thundering from this
[1:59:59] pulpit.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; It's a voice like the one that stood at
[2:00:04] the grave of Lazarus, not to mourn the
[2:00:07] dead, but to raise the dead.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to mourn because you're
[2:00:12] lukewarm and cold and powerless. I am
[2:00:14] here not to mourn your passion, but to
[2:00:18] celebrate your resurrection. Amen.
[2:00:20] You're coming out.
[2:00:23] I said you're coming out. I don't care
[2:00:26] how long you've been bound down. I don't
[2:00:29] care how long the spirit of God has not
[2:00:32] been able to move in your life. You're
[2:00:34] coming out of that tomb.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; And there's a bride that is coming out.
[2:00:39] A bride that can worship him. A God
[2:00:41] bride that can give him praise. A bride
[2:00:44] that can shout the hallelujah because
[2:00:46] she's not dead but alive.
[2:00:50] [Applause]
[2:00:58] That voice that said then Lazarus
[2:01:01] come forth
[2:01:02] is calling your name.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Then it was for one man but now it's for
[2:01:08] everyone that can hear.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; It's the prophetic call of this hour.
[2:01:12] He's still calling his own from tombs
[2:01:16] of man's religion.
[2:01:19] For the Bible said, "The time has come
[2:01:22] when the dead will hear the voice of the
[2:01:25] Son of God, and those who hear will
[2:01:27] live."
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Today may be your day to hear.
[2:01:36] But the Bible said if you harden your
[2:01:37] heart and you won't listen to his voice,
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; you will provoke God
[2:01:45] and he'll turn from you because this is
[2:01:48] him in mercy.
[2:01:52] There are dead men walking
[2:01:54] until the word finds them.
[2:01:58] These are men and women who sits in
[2:02:00] church every week. Oh yeah. morally
[2:02:03] upright, socially clean, doctrally
[2:02:06] informed. They know all the message, but
[2:02:08] spiritually dead.
[2:02:11] They're like the dry bones of Ezekiel.
[2:02:13] Dry, scattered, lifeless.
[2:02:17] But when the word and the spirit come
[2:02:20] together, listen to me now. Not just
[2:02:22] when the word come, but when the spirit
[2:02:25] gets in the word.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. But when the word and the
[2:02:31] spirit come together, when the word is
[2:02:33] demonstrating power, something begins to
[2:02:36] happen.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Let me just read it from Ezekiel 37. And
[2:02:41] as I prophesied,
[2:02:43] there was suddenly a noise, a ratman,
[2:02:45] and the bones came together bone to
[2:02:47] bone. You see, that's revival.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; That's resurrection.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; It's noisy, but it ain't just noise.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; It's life.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. They say it's emotional, but it
[2:02:59] isn't just emotion. It's resurrection.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "As I looked, tendons
[2:03:05] appeared on them and flesh grew and skin
[2:03:08] covered them, but there was no breath in
[2:03:10] them."
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; And then he said to me, "Prophesy."
[2:03:14] You said, "Brother Tim, why do you
[2:03:15] preach this?" Because preaching is
[2:03:17] prophesying.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; It's when the Holy Spirit gets a hold of
[2:03:20] a man, uses his voice, and prophesies.
[2:03:23] Prophesy, oh son of man. Nothing
[2:03:25] happened until the prophecy.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, you preachers ought to shut
[2:03:31] up and sit down." No, we must prophesy
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; again.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; You see, again, he said, "Prophesy to
[2:03:40] the breath. Prophesy, oh son of man, and
[2:03:44] tell the breath that is that is this is
[2:03:47] what the Lord says. Come from the four
[2:03:49] winds." That's the four directions. Oh
[2:03:52] breath and breathe into these slain that
[2:03:55] they may live. And that's what I cry.
[2:03:58] That's what I'm prophesying. Breathe, oh
[2:04:01] breath of God.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Breathe. Amen. Separate me from the
[2:04:06] chaff.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. From the sin that so easily beset
[2:04:10] me. Blow out the chaff of unbelief. Fill
[2:04:13] me.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Fill this house.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Fill that house. Fill that house. Fill
[2:04:19] that house. Fill this house. Amen.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Feel the pride everywhere.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I prophesied and he came. He
[2:04:28] commanded me and the breath entered them
[2:04:30] and they came to life and stood on their
[2:04:31] feet, a vast army.
[2:04:34] And he said unto me, "Oh, son of man,
[2:04:37] these bones are the whole house of
[2:04:39] Israel." Now, I'm speaking to spiritual
[2:04:42] Israel.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; The bride of Christ. Look, they're
[2:04:46] saying our bones are dried up and our
[2:04:49] hope is perished and we're cut off.
[2:04:53] Therefore, prophesy and tell them, "This
[2:04:55] is what the Lord God says. Oh, my
[2:04:58] people, I will open your graves and
[2:05:00] bring you up from them. I'll bring you
[2:05:02] out of tombs of religion where you were
[2:05:04] scattered among the denominations. I'll
[2:05:07] bring you back to the land of Israel.
[2:05:09] I'll make you possess the land of the
[2:05:11] apostles, the prophets. I I'll make you
[2:05:13] to walk where Jesus walked and live like
[2:05:16] Jesus lived.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; And then you, my people, will know I'm
[2:05:20] the Lord where I open the graves and
[2:05:22] bring them up through from them. Bring
[2:05:25] you up from them. I will put my spirit
[2:05:27] in you and you will live and I will
[2:05:30] settle you. I'll position you in your
[2:05:32] own land, my inheritance. You will know
[2:05:35] that I, the Lord, have spoken and I will
[2:05:38] do it, declares the Lord. Let me tell
[2:05:40] you, the Holy Ghost is not a
[2:05:42] denominational badge. That's right.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; It's not the name of a message church.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; He He's not a chill bump either, nor a
[2:05:50] religious or even a religious
[2:05:52] atmosphere. He's resurrection life.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; You heath he quickened who was dead in
[2:05:58] sins.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; But he'll find men. He'll find dead men
[2:06:03] in pulpits,
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; women dead in traditions, youth bound in
[2:06:08] sin. And one breath, one spark.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; One word, they live.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Jason Tyler, they live.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; One word,
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; one word of freedom. This is not
[2:06:23] reformation. It's resurrection.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; It's transforming power at work.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; And what happens when dead men come
[2:06:33] alive? They leave the graveyards of
[2:06:36] their former life. They shake off the
[2:06:39] grave clothes of man-made doctrines.
[2:06:42] They look no more for living water and
[2:06:45] broken sistns. They no longer echo what
[2:06:47] others said. They now hear his voice for
[2:06:50] themselves.
[2:06:52] They have heard the voice of the Son of
[2:06:55] Man, and they live.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; For the hour is coming,
[2:07:02] and now is when the dead shall hear the
[2:07:05] voice of the Son of God, and they that
[2:07:07] hear shall live.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; They don't just go to church.
[2:07:13] Hear me now. They don't just go to
[2:07:16] church.
[2:07:18] They become the church. Amen.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; They don't just talk about revival.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; They are the revival.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; They don't. And let me tell you what
[2:07:31] they do. They go from tomb to testimony.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen. And when when that's
[2:07:40] exactly what happened with Lazarus,
[2:07:42] wasn't it? He came from the tomb and was
[2:07:45] a testimony.
[2:07:47] And when Jesus raised him, Lazarus, he
[2:07:50] told him, "Loose them and let him go."
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; And that's the command today. Loose my
[2:07:57] people.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; It's the same word that came to Moses.
[2:08:01] Go tell Pharaoh, "Let my people go."
[2:08:05] Amen.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; You see, free them from theological
[2:08:10] wrappings, from systems that bury the
[2:08:13] supernatural,
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; that deny God's power, that will no
[2:08:17] longer believe in altar calls or prayer
[2:08:19] lines that brings healing to both the
[2:08:21] soul and the body and even the spirit of
[2:08:23] man.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Loose my people. Let them go
[2:08:29] from traditions that binds the bride.
[2:08:32] These resurrection ones are now walking
[2:08:35] talking testimonies.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; They are living epistles read of all
[2:08:40] men.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. They are the bride awakened,
[2:08:45] called out, filled with fire, ready to
[2:08:47] meet the bridegroom. For this is the
[2:08:50] hour of awakening.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; This is the hour of awakening. Maybe you
[2:08:55] need to tell your neighbor that and wake
[2:08:56] him up.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; This is the hour of awakening. Come on,
[2:09:00] try it. Put it on your lips. Arise from
[2:09:03] the dead
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; and Christ shall give you life.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; I saw a cartoon one time of a of a of a
[2:09:12] preacher with a turnaround collar and he
[2:09:15] was very aristocratic in the pulpit and
[2:09:19] you know and he said, "Now I will
[2:09:20] perform the solemn act of raising the
[2:09:24] dead."
[2:09:25] And showed the next picture and he said,
[2:09:28] "Church dismissed.
[2:09:38] Maybe that's what you think when I say,
[2:09:41] "Let my people go."
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, God's calling you
[2:09:47] out of your tomb.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; He's calling you out of your shell,
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; of the place you've been way too long.
[2:09:59] You see, Ephesians 5
[2:10:02] has told us, "Arise from the dead.
[2:10:05] Christ will give you life." This is the
[2:10:08] shout before the rapture. It's the
[2:10:10] awakening cry in the midnight hour. It's
[2:10:13] not a time of decorating tombs,
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; having pity parties for while you're in
[2:10:19] there,
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; calling mourning. Why? You know why that
[2:10:23] you are the way you are. You know the
[2:10:26] why you are the way you are? because you
[2:10:27] have chose to be that way.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; You say, "No, brother Tim, circumstances
[2:10:34] in my life has made me." No, you you
[2:10:37] decided what to do with those
[2:10:39] circumstances.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; And because of that, it's become your
[2:10:45] tomb.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; But this is not a time to decorate your
[2:10:50] tomb,
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; to put flowers on it. It's a time to
[2:10:53] break out of them.
[2:10:55] I'm not going to fire your tomb this
[2:10:57] morning. I'm not going to lay a bouquet
[2:10:59] on it cuz you're dead.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; I am commanding you cut out.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not time for bard creeds.
[2:11:07] It's time for the living word to be made
[2:11:10] flesh in a bride. Let the dead bury
[2:11:13] their dead. But the quickened bride is
[2:11:15] alive. She's alive from the dead and
[2:11:18] she's marching
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; to meet her Lord in the air. Amen.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; Behold a white cloud.
[2:11:26] Now notice the atmosphere is shifting.
[2:11:30] Revelation 14:4 said 14:14 said, "I
[2:11:34] looked and behold a white cloud and one
[2:11:38] upon the clouds sat like unto the son of
[2:11:42] man." This is not a gentle
[2:11:45] cloud of weathered patterns.
[2:11:49] Th this is not a a cloud that you know
[2:11:53] draws figures in the skies and you sit
[2:11:55] in daydream.
[2:11:57] This is a cloud
[2:12:00] of his presence.
[2:12:03] This is a divine manifestation.
[2:12:07] Jesus said he would return in the clouds
[2:12:10] of glory. And remember again, Revelation
[2:12:14] is a book of symbols.
[2:12:16] So this is not a literal cloud.
[2:12:19] It's symbolic of his spirit moving. But
[2:12:22] before that white cloud of his glorified
[2:12:25] appearing, we also we can see storm
[2:12:27] clouds gathering.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; We see other clouds in the sky. We see
[2:12:33] clouds of war and unrest, war and rumors
[2:12:37] of war.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; We see economic shaking. We see moral
[2:12:42] collapse. We see spiritual deception.
[2:12:47] We see nature groaning and these are
[2:12:49] storm clouds.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. But above them all, above all
[2:12:55] of these storm clouds, in control of
[2:12:58] everything, one sits enthroned, crowned
[2:13:02] with gold, holding a sickle. Not a
[2:13:06] scepter of mercy this time, but a sickle
[2:13:08] for reaping. And he's not shown now
[2:13:10] walking in the midst of the candlestick.
[2:13:12] He's seating here ruling. And the golden
[2:13:15] crown shows
[2:13:18] in this scene of John's vision that he's
[2:13:20] not coming as lamb only. But he is now
[2:13:24] judge, harvester, king.
[2:13:28] His gold speaks of his divinity. The
[2:13:32] crown speaks of his sovereignty. The
[2:13:34] sickle speaks of finality. He has legal
[2:13:38] authority to reap.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? because he redeemed the field
[2:13:43] with his own blood.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; And now he comes to gather what belongs
[2:13:48] to him.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The time has come. Thrust in
[2:13:52] thy sickle. You see, the harvest of the
[2:13:55] earth is ripe. It's not seed time. This
[2:13:59] is not waiting time. The long waiting of
[2:14:03] the seven ages is over. We've come to
[2:14:05] the end. This is harvest time.
[2:14:09] And the word ripe here in the Greek
[2:14:13] literally means dried up, overripe,
[2:14:17] past due,
[2:14:20] as in as in now no more delay. You can't
[2:14:24] wait any longer. There comes a time that
[2:14:27] God says, "I won't wait no longer."
[2:14:32] How many times have we sung the song,
[2:14:35] Wait a Little
[2:14:38] Jesus,
[2:14:41] there's so many of our loved ones out in
[2:14:44] sin,
[2:14:47] wait a little longer, please Jesus,
[2:14:52] a few more days to get our loved ones
[2:14:55] in.
[2:14:57] But one day that comes to a halt,
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; the wait is over
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; and the fruit. Now unlike a fig, unlike
[2:15:10] a plum, unlike a apple gets overripe is
[2:15:12] ruined.
[2:15:14] But like the grain,
[2:15:17] all it can do is just seal the life into
[2:15:19] it.
[2:15:21] And his extended mercy, God has waited,
[2:15:25] but now the cup is full.
[2:15:27] And the cup of iniquity
[2:15:30] has now reached its limit.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; And and now the tears are being exposed.
[2:15:40] And what is to be harvested? The bride.
[2:15:43] For he says in Matthew 13:30, "Gather
[2:15:47] the wheat into my barn." You see, these
[2:15:50] are elect. The word seed children
[2:15:52] matured and ripened by the sunlight of
[2:15:55] the revealed truth. This is the rapture
[2:15:59] harvest. A gathered together of the
[2:16:01] final sheath, a bride made ready.
[2:16:04] Revelation 19:7. You see, the sickle is
[2:16:07] sharp. It cuts cleanly. There's no
[2:16:09] struggle. She's ready. And the tears and
[2:16:12] the wheat become separated. Amen.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; So he says, "Let them both grow
[2:16:21] together."
[2:16:22] But now tolerance is over.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; And in the time of harvest, when
[2:16:30] tolerance is over, I'll say, "Gather ye
[2:16:34] first the tears."
[2:16:36] And then gather them into bones to burn
[2:16:39] them. And these are the religious
[2:16:42] systems, the apostate churches, carnal
[2:16:45] believers that rejected the word of the
[2:16:48] hour.
[2:16:50] Amen. You can do let me let me tell you,
[2:16:53] you can sit on a pew like this morning
[2:16:55] and reject the word of the hour.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Not allow it to have its effect in your
[2:17:01] life.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; Rejection is not just an outright
[2:17:04] condemnation. Say, "I don't believe it."
[2:17:08] But it's a refusal to walk in it.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; They're bundled. These carnal believers
[2:17:14] that rejected the word of the hour are
[2:17:16] bundled. They're not raptured. They're
[2:17:17] organized and grouped by an ecumenical
[2:17:21] spirit for burning, not preserving. And
[2:17:23] let me tell you, these are not atheist,
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; but having a form of godliness,
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; yet deny his power.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; And the harvest is not just a time of
[2:17:34] gathering. It's a time of divine
[2:17:36] separation.
[2:17:38] where the line is drawn between the true
[2:17:40] and the false.
[2:17:42] Because the sunlight of the revelation
[2:17:46] is maturing the grain and as the week
[2:17:49] comes to its full ripeness, the tears
[2:17:52] manifest what they truly are
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; because it's manifesting time.
[2:17:59] So this shows us that harvest signs are
[2:18:03] everywhere. doctrinal confusion,
[2:18:06] rejection of truth, apostasy.
[2:18:10] They're being bound together. But at the
[2:18:12] same time, a bride is being gathered by
[2:18:15] the revealed word. She's received the
[2:18:17] message to purify her, separating her
[2:18:21] from the chaff of unbelief,
[2:18:23] washing her by the water of the word.
[2:18:26] Harvest and harvest bride is rapturing
[2:18:29] her. God is separating while the carnal
[2:18:33] church is blending, compromising,
[2:18:37] aligned with worldly ideologies.
[2:18:40] The bride is being called to separation
[2:18:42] and purity and to power. Just as Ruth
[2:18:45] had to leave Moab and walk in the fields
[2:18:48] of Boaz, the bride is walking away from
[2:18:51] man-made system to lay at the feet of
[2:18:53] her redeemer. She has heard the voice
[2:18:56] that says, "Come out of her, my people,
[2:18:59] that you be not partakers of her
[2:19:01] plagues."
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; You see, this is this is command. It's a
[2:19:05] separation. And not everybody hears it.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; But those whose ears are tuned to the
[2:19:12] spirit knows the difference between the
[2:19:14] voice of man and the voice of the
[2:19:15] bridegroom.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; You see, it says in the Bible, two are
[2:19:19] in the field, one taken, one left.
[2:19:24] And where are they when this happens? In
[2:19:27] the field,
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; the harvest field, working side by side,
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; singing the same songs,
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; going through the motions of religion,
[2:19:37] quoting the same scriptures,
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; but one is wheat, the other is a tear.
[2:19:42] And as a sickle swings, when the clouds
[2:19:46] roll in and wave after wave of his glory
[2:19:49] strikes the earth, one rises and the
[2:19:52] others left.
[2:19:56] This is harvest time.
[2:20:01] You see, not all yet that's in the grave
[2:20:04] will hear the voice of God and live.
[2:20:07] at the resurrection
[2:20:09] before the rapture only the bride of
[2:20:12] Christ of the seven ages will rise. You
[2:20:15] say, "Well, what about the Old Testament
[2:20:17] say?" They rose with Jesus.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, all of them,
[2:20:22] they all rose with Jesus. Not one of
[2:20:24] them was left.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Paradise was emptied.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh but now, but now we're
[2:20:33] looking for the saints of the New
[2:20:34] Testaments to come forth. And let me
[2:20:37] tell you, we we we we are seeing right
[2:20:41] now a separation is coming. And God will
[2:20:44] even separate those that are in the
[2:20:46] grave because there will be some that
[2:20:49] will come out and some will be left.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. And let me tell you
[2:20:54] something, it won't be like a lot of
[2:20:56] people thinks, you know, where a bunch
[2:20:58] of gravestones will just be open
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; and and tumbled over
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; and the world will know because the
[2:21:06] bride must have left and resurrection
[2:21:07] cuz look at all this that the calamity
[2:21:09] in the graveyard. No, it won't even be
[2:21:12] that way.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:14] He'll pull out He'll pull out the
[2:21:16] remains of his elect
[2:21:19] without one one piece of soil being
[2:21:22] other pieces of soil being bothered
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; or disturbed.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; I had an old aunt. Well, she wasn't
[2:21:31] aunt. She's my mother's cousin. She
[2:21:33] said, "We live in Houston."
[2:21:36] and said, "You know, now they're having
[2:21:39] to the graveyards are covered are are so
[2:21:42] crowded they're burying one on top of
[2:21:44] another."
[2:21:46] Said, "I'll tell you what. I'm not going
[2:21:48] to be buried in a graveyard like that
[2:21:50] because if I go first, my husband be
[2:21:52] buried on top of me and he may not rise
[2:21:55] and I'll be stuck."
[2:21:59] But let me tell you friends that the
[2:22:02] time is when those that are in the grave
[2:22:05] will hear the voice of God and live.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. They will rise. They will rise to
[2:22:11] meet him. And I'll tell you what, this
[2:22:13] morning, even right now, even right now,
[2:22:16] there are those that are in this
[2:22:18] pre-resurrection time that are
[2:22:20] experiencing resurrection spiritually.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is going through the church
[2:22:25] raising those from the dead. Let me just
[2:22:28] give you another scripture just before
[2:22:30] we close. You know of the sunlight of
[2:22:32] revelation. The Bible said, "And his
[2:22:34] son, his countenance was his son shineth
[2:22:37] in his strength." For the Bible said,
[2:22:40] "In the evening time it shall be light."
[2:22:44] Revelation 10 proclaims the portrays the
[2:22:48] mighty angel, the Lord himself, coming
[2:22:50] down with an open book. His face shine
[2:22:53] like the noonday sun.
[2:22:55] And this tell us that the day prophesied
[2:22:57] by Zachchariah is a day not quite
[2:23:03] like day or night where the light was
[2:23:06] dimmed and truth was scattered but is
[2:23:08] now given away to the brilliance of the
[2:23:10] evening light. And what does that mean?
[2:23:13] It means that mysteries that were once
[2:23:17] sealed have now been revealed.
[2:23:20] the types and shadows that covered the
[2:23:24] clouds that covered his face now are
[2:23:27] fleeing away and the you remember in the
[2:23:30] Song of Solomon he says I see him
[2:23:32] through the lattice what does that mean
[2:23:34] always we used to see him through the
[2:23:36] types and the shadows we couldn't get a
[2:23:38] glimpse of him but now he shows himself
[2:23:41] with an unveiled face
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; as the fullness of the word is made
[2:23:45] known to the bride and what was only
[2:23:46] symbol is now substance
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; what was veiled was now unveiled. It is
[2:23:52] Christ the mystery of God revealed.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; What a day we're living in, friends. And
[2:23:59] let me tell you, the evening light
[2:24:01] doesn't just shine. It discloses the
[2:24:04] identity of every plant in the field.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; It illuminates the field. It shows who
[2:24:10] truly carries the life of the seed and
[2:24:12] who merely has the form.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; It's not just enough to look like a
[2:24:16] wheat and grow among the wheat. That's a
[2:24:18] tear. Only the gain is gathered into the
[2:24:21] garden.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; So let them grow together to the
[2:24:24] harvest. And the light makes the harvest
[2:24:27] possible. Because without the light,
[2:24:29] there could be no ripening. And without
[2:24:30] ripening, there cannot be no rapture.
[2:24:33] But let me tell you, in this hour, there
[2:24:36] is a word born bride.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. In this hour, Revelation 10, the
[2:24:42] book is open and the voice of the
[2:24:44] seventh angel, the mighty angel
[2:24:46] descended and the declar declaration,
[2:24:48] time shall be no more.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; And the ages are coming to the end. And
[2:24:53] this is a very sunlight. And by the way,
[2:24:56] the time being no more means there will
[2:24:57] be no more delay.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; I I'm ushering in my coming. I'm the
[2:25:02] harvest now. If we believe we're in
[2:25:05] Revelation 10, we believe now that the
[2:25:07] delay is over. Amen. The long waiting of
[2:25:11] har of of growth is over. And now he
[2:25:13] gives way to the harvest time.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; And it's no longer evening twilight.
[2:25:18] It's the evening sun and is now shining
[2:25:21] in full strength. The very sun that
[2:25:23] shown in its strength in the eastern sky
[2:25:27] back there 2,000 years ago is now the
[2:25:29] same sun with all the obscurity, all the
[2:25:33] clouds, all the shadows, all the false
[2:25:35] doctrines moved away. and the light now
[2:25:38] shining in his full glory to ripen you
[2:25:41] and bring you to maturity as the bride
[2:25:43] of Jesus Christ, a bride who have made
[2:25:46] herself ready. I say, let us be glad and
[2:25:48] rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has
[2:25:50] come and his bride, the lamb's wife,
[2:25:53] have made herself ready.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; It's harvest time, church. It's going
[2:25:58] home time.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. The call is going out. It's
[2:26:01] reaching out wherever you are. Let it
[2:26:04] touch your heart this morning as the
[2:26:06] musicians come.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's bringing life to the grain
[2:26:11] and drawing a line of separation.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; This is the hour to stand. Oh yeah,
[2:26:18] they'll reject you. They'll reject
[2:26:19] Jesus. They'll reject his bride. But God
[2:26:22] has gathered his elect,
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; sealing them with his word, preparing a
[2:26:28] people for the rapture.
[2:26:31] I wonder this morning, could it be our
[2:26:33] heart's cry? Lord, prepare me.
[2:26:37] Lord, move in my life. Let's sing those
[2:26:40] last two verses that Timothy sang there
[2:26:43] of it as well.
[2:26:49] I thought that was so applicable to what
[2:26:51] I was preaching.
[2:26:55] We could talk about more.
[2:26:58] There's going to be a gathering, a
[2:26:59] harvest of the grapes of wrath in
[2:27:02] Revelation 14:18-20.
[2:27:05] Gather the clusters of the vine of the
[2:27:07] earth, for grapes are fully ripe.
[2:27:10] And the wine press was trotten without
[2:27:12] the city.
[2:27:14] This will be the harvest of judgment,
[2:27:16] the world system, nations, armies that
[2:27:19] will come under the wrath of Almighty
[2:27:22] God in the great battle of Armageddon
[2:27:24] ahead.
[2:27:26] These are not just individuals. These
[2:27:28] are governments, empires, entire systems
[2:27:31] who have rejected his lordship.
[2:27:36] And their rightness is not righteousness
[2:27:39] at all, but iniquity, fully ripe for
[2:27:42] destruction. And they'll be destroyed in
[2:27:44] the tribulation ahead.
[2:27:48] But what about you this morning?
[2:27:51] [Music]
[2:27:53] Is there someone today
[2:27:57] that may be sealed behind some sin,
[2:28:00] some secret sin,
[2:28:03] held by chains
[2:28:06] like Legion was dwelling among the tombs
[2:28:11] and you hear that voice.
[2:28:15] He comes looking for you. He comes
[2:28:18] walking down to your pew. He comes to
[2:28:21] speak to your heart. He comes to loose
[2:28:24] you from those chains of bondage and
[2:28:27] give you a freedom like you've never
[2:28:28] known.
[2:28:30] Can you ask him in your life today? Can
[2:28:33] you ask him into your heart? Can you ask
[2:28:35] him to change you in his presence?
[2:28:39] Can you hear this voice?
[2:28:42] Can you hear the voice saying, "Roll
[2:28:45] away that stone."
[2:28:47] Can you hear the voice saying, "Come
[2:28:49] out. Come out out from among her and be
[2:28:52] separate, sayeth the Lord." Can you hear
[2:28:55] him this morning?
[2:28:57] Can you hear the voice of the son of God
[2:28:59] and live?
[2:29:02] Give me that next to last verse.
[2:29:08] Let's stand as we sing this.
[2:29:11] Lord
[2:29:13] haste the day
[2:29:16] when my face
[2:29:19] shall be
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; the
[2:29:26] clouds be rolled back.
