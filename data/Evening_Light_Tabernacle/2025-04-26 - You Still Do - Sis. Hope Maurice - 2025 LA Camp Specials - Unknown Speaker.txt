========================================

[Music] Well, I [Music] remember when I danced at the altar. I don't care if it cost me a friend or two. I remember getting baptized in cold water, then rising with the fire in my soul. Same power now and forever. No, you're not through. Same words can speak to the mountains and make them move. I know the God of the old is the God of the new. I know that you did it then and you still do. Do do you remember the roar of the choir as they praise him for hours and he'll fill the room? Well, I remember when they told her she had cancer and we didn't have the answer. the word through you too. Same power now and forever. No more not through. Same words can speak to the mountains and make them move. I know the God of the old is the God of the new. I know that you did it then and you still mighty and strong, faithful and true. You'll make a way cuz that's just what you do. You're the breaker of chain beginning and end. I'll sing it over and know we're the same. power now and forever. You're not through. Say words can speak to the mountains and make them move. I know the God of the old is the light of the new. I know that you did it in and you still do the same power now and forever. No, you're not. Same words can speak to the mountains and make them new. I know the God of the old is the God of the new. I know that you did it then and you still do. Still do. [Music] [Applause]
