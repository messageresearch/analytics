You are on your throne. [Music] &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful you made a way for us to approach it. &gt;&gt; Not in terror, not in fear, but Lord, a way to approach it [Music] where we are welcome, invited, loved, and heard. Lord, thank you for your children today that have gathered here with us. Thank you for your blessings that you've poured out upon us, Lord, and the wonderful meetings that we've had here and that we just come through, Lord. The great times together, the wonderful service Wednesday night and now today. We come here on this day to give you praise, to give you glory, to give you honor. because there's just nobody like you and we worship you. And if we can't, Lord, from the depths of our hearts, we want to just truly say that we love you. We're thankful for the grace in our lives, for the mercy, Lord, that endures, for healing that is ours, and that you hear our petitions, Lord, when we come before your throne. Lord, we want to bring our brother Kenny Camp before you today. who just wrote me said, "I'd love to be there, but infirmities, pain, just keep him from coming." Lord, I pray God you'll help our brother. Our sister Jeanie will get her report this week. Lord, I I just pray for a good report. But no matter what the doctors say, we look to your report. For you said, "Who hath believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" And certainly we've seen your arm revealed in this day bringing healing and deliverance, salvation in your mighty name. Lord, I pray dear God that you'll just touch your people. Lord, whatever the needs are, our brother Aaron, the upcoming surgery he'll have, Lord, I I pray you'll be with him. Lord, the needs of your peoples, those that are homesick, those that are traveling home today, and oh God, that's been away. I I pray that they would had a blessed time and that you'll bring them back safely, Father. Father, they've had ones different meetings and beautiful weekend and some have gone away and Lord, I just pray you'll bless them in a special way. But us here this morning that have gathered together in your name, I pray that you'll minister to ever so personally that you'll be a personal God to everyone. Lord, if necessary, Lord, that you'll as it was walk out from this pullpit down to their pew and speak to them in a personal way. Lord, I ask in Jesus name, you who discerns the thoughts and intents of heart the word that you'll take over and you'll speak to your children in a special way, bless the word as we read it. Supply the needs of your children and encourage us all in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. My It's good to be in the house of the Lord today. And we want to give you a greetings and welcome and um just so glad that you're here today. And I hope if you are a visitor here, you won't feel like one when you leave, but you'll just feel a part with us. And uh you know, brother Timothy and I are headed to France. Thank you. We're headed to France this week and and we have meetings there. I just wanted to say, you know, the meetings here were for the of our October meetings. They were just over the top. I'm still feast feasting on them. &gt;&gt; So many deliverances, so many victories. &gt;&gt; So many held hostage by sin or sickness that were released. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm glad for that. And we just pray that God's blessings will continue. And if the Lord touched your life that you will just use that to build on that and to go forward in him. You know, I I I I wish everybody was here so that I could really uh give a proper expression of my appreciation to each one that labored so faithfully during our meetings. and you know your love for the Lord, your dedication to his house have been a true testimony of Christian service and we saw that in action and we so appreciate it. You know, we had so much that was accomplished. Um, I I I probably will leave out something that is probably that I probably should really have paid attention to or or brought brought out in this, but you know, there's just things that were done like the painting of all the doors of the church and, you know, something that I wanted done, the refurbishing of the servant bars with their beautiful new tops and and then, you know, the the sound panels. Uh did you enjoy that better in the fellowship hall there where it was uh not as noisy and and you could fellowship a little better and and of course you know then the the things we've done here on the platform uh constructing the new cabinet wall and and um that just was superb. So just just exactly what we needed. Others gave hours to cleaning and power washing and softwashing the buildings and you know it just ensuring everything looked excellent and it did and um we've had the platform music area rearranged with a lot of care and and um it just to me just created a a fresh atmosphere for worship and um and of course uh I don't know if you noticed or not but they did something for the the youth there. Um they put time and energy in a little whiffle ball field out here and bringing in sand and leveling the ground. You know, when we had the old church back um way out in the back woods and we were landlocked, I kept being asked over and over, we need someplace for our children to to to play and to do something. You know, they're running between the cars and it's dangerous and all of that. Can't you do something? and I couldn't create land and it was always frustrating to me because couldn't provide that but you know here we've been blessed and we have abundance and uh 40 acres here that the Lord provided us and then you know you know I I want to just compliment you on your hospitality um where many things happened behind the scenes you know it you go to naming names why you'd have to name the whole church cuz everybody did something and you provided meals and gave hospitality. I believe that reflects the heart of Christ. And uh we had those sack lunches after service. And while the the the fellowship meal we had on Sunday and and the food that was prepared for and then others brought food, prepared food for for those that were hosting visitors in their homes. And I was a recipient of that too as the ministry stayed with me. and they provided welcome packages and arranged transportation to and fro from the the airport and others just opened up their homes to guests and you just did every kind of things to make everything run smoothly and and and I want to say thank you every act, every touch, every detail. I may not speak about it this morning, but it was noticed and and and if I didn't see it, God did &gt;&gt; and it's so deeply appreciated. So, you know, as we as I say today, thank you Evening Light Tabernacle for your your great spirit of excellence and your unity, your love, and you made this pastor very proud and uh and I'm so thankful beyond words. God bless you. And today I want you to turn with me to the scripture to Revelation chapter 2 and we'll read from the fourth verse. And um you know we we do know we got more than half of or at least half the church gone this this uh weekend. And uh and so you know just because half of them are gone don't mean I'm preaching half of a sermon. So, you know, I I always um kind of made it my motto, you know, when I one time preached to a group of a little group over in I think it was Mississippi of about six or seven people and my wife and I was one of them six and seven and and I preached to them just like I would a thousand because I figured if God couldn't trust me to do my best with five or six or seven, he sure couldn't trust trust me with a thousand. So, you know, we put all of our heart into it every time. And so, you know, you can for those that are not here with us, well, you can make up for their absence by being present. &gt;&gt; Amen. By giving your attention and um by responding to the word of God. Revelation chapter 2 and 4. Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love. God bless you. You can be seated. Now, I'm speaking today from a scripture that started the slide towards the fall of the church. And this is also the pattern every revival has followed. And I'm going to be speaking on breaking the cycle of revival and death. So we so it's a pattern of course that is repeated itself through church history from the days of Ephesus until now. As you know, the the church would begin with fire and with power and with a and with purity. And it was birthed that the church at Ephesus was birthed through the ministry of the apostle Paul, the the very messenger who received the revelation of the church as the body of Christ. And under that anointing, the scripture tells us that they labored, they endured, they tested false apostles and they stood against evil. So there was a lot of good that they did and and and the and God acknowledged that as he said, I know thy works and thy labor and thy patience. Yet that same voice had to cry out and and and in the same moment give it a complaint. You know, they said, "Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love." You see, Ephesus was a church that aimed high. But of course, we know they relaxed. And what began in power of the spirit, it it slowly just cooled off to formality and tradition. uh they had that labor, works and patience but left the first love and and that that same cycle of revival was was followed by decline. And this has repeated itself in every age. I could actually go from Genesis where the presence of God was there and and see them decline there and lose the the the spirit and not have the walk with God. And we could take every generation, whether it be the generation of Noah or the generation of of Abraham or or or where they would degenerate down in Egypt. And we could spend a lot of time on these cycles that has happened throughout history. And uh but let me tell you something. According to the word of God, the church that Jesus planted on the day of Pentecost will not end in crop failure. You see, the Bible said, "The husband waiteth for the the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it." And neither will it harvest something different than what the son of man planted. Because the law of God stands true that whatever you sow, that which you you will reap. And and God does not sow wheat to reap weeds. &gt;&gt; So, he's going to have a crop in this end time. He does not plan a bride in Pentecostal fire and then have his church stand in ashes. &gt;&gt; And fact of the matter is he says contrarywise prophecy tells us in Hagi 2 and9 the glory of this latter house shall be greater than the farmer. &gt;&gt; So the bride will not end in decay in in Leodysian lukewarmness. She will be transformed by the same spirit that fell at Pentecost as the hearts of the children are being turned back to the faith of the apostolic fathers. &gt;&gt; So she began with the outpouring of the Holy Ghost and and she will finish with the same fire, the same faith, the same life that came that day in the upper room. But we are living now in the final moments of the last church age which is le oazia which Jesus said the church would be lukewarm but not everybody. Thank God. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hear brother Brandham saying is but this bride will not be a le oysia. She will be by no means be lukewarm. For at the same time though that this is the the hour of the res restoration of all things. This is this is not the time to drift into spiritual death but rather the time that we must press into resurrection life cuz this is an hour like no other hour. This is resurrection hour. And the Apostle Paul warned us in the scripture. He said, "In the last days, perilous times shall come." And you look around and there's wars and there's famine and there's moral decay and plagues that are shaking the nations. And these are tribulation, pre-tribulation birth painans of a world that is in travail because we know it's going to give birth to a new to a new earth. And so we have all kinds of things that are happening. There are earthquakes and new diseases and mass incarceration and mental anguish and threats of nuclear destruction. And they all testify of a world that today is staggered in judgment. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Sodom before it's burning, so shall it be in the days of the Son of Man." And we're living in that time. But even in this dark hour, the spirit of God is calling on the people to break the cycle, to refuse to cool off, to rise up to be a glorious church without spot wrinkle. Amen. Having no such thing. You see, because she'll be a pure unadulterated word bride. The fire that fell at Pentecost, it was not given just to burn for one generation. I want you to remember it was to lie to every one of the seven ages. It was meant to burn until the coming of the Lord and through other though other generations let it burn out. We must not. &gt;&gt; And this is our calling. And and in this call is a call to rekindle the flame, to guard the oil, to walk in the spirit until the trumpet announces the approach of the bridegroom for the meeting in the air. It is important to do as the scripture said, to be watchful and to strengthen the things which remain because we got a world today that is spiraling into confusion. Amen. and and it seemed like to them there is no answer. And the voices of religious leaders who were once trusted have grown vain and powerless. Whether it be the those polished crusades of of Billy Graham or those of the healer revival of Or Roberts, the denominational heads of vast church systems, none of them hold the remedy for this dying age. Whether it doesn't matter where you look, whether it's the evangelicals, the charismatics, the reformers, they're all searching and they're all failing to bring the world back to God. And even the pope will wrestle to restrain the sins that is in his own priesthood. The shelves line our Christian bookstores and they overflow with millions of books and every one of them are promising solutions. There's even a new breed of preachers flocking like vultures on a dying corpse claiming something different from the Acts 2 experience. &gt;&gt; As Jeremiah said, yet none of them can heal the wound of the daughter of Zion. None of them have the remedy. As Jesus said, the blind leaders of the blind and if they blind lead the blind, both shall fall in the ditch. So we live in a world today, a church world that mirrors Sodom, is blind, is corrupt, it's groping for the door while judgment is ready to fall. &gt;&gt; And we we live in a time where the moral decay is undeniable. Why? In 1960, there were like 393 divorces here in America. By 1999, that number had exploded to 1.2 million. In in 2025, the number of divorces recorded in America was was 672,52 divorces and enolments. Now, you might think that the numbers have dropped. Well, Brother Tim, they've dropped. We're improving. They've dropped now by nearly a half a million or more. But here's what's really happening behind the numbers. And it's a very sobering picture when you look at the moral and the spiritual condition of society. You see in 1970 there were 2.2 million marriages in the US. By 2023 that had dropped to 1.8 million marriages even though the population grew by over 100 million. So fewer so fewer marriages mean fewer divorces not because the righteousness is rising but because commitment is failing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And cohabitation has replaced marriage for many and you know it's sin. &gt;&gt; One research reports that the number of unmarried couples living together has more than tripled since 1990. About 60% of adults under 35, the age of 35 now say cohabitation is acceptable even without marriage. Many couples simply separate rather than divorce and choose another partner a partner which never shows up in these stats. &gt;&gt; So you see it's a time like in the book of Judges, every man is doing what is right in his own eyes. And this is one of the clearest signs of the Leodysian spirit of compromise. &gt;&gt; It's a it's a world wanting love without covenant. &gt;&gt; They want pleasure without purity. They want security without surrender. &gt;&gt; So while divorce numbers look lower, the real picture is that society has drifted further away from the sacredness of marriage than ever before. In fact of the matter, they have made it a joke for just anybody. You could, you know, you could, my goodness, almost to the point you can marry your dog. There's no sacredness. &gt;&gt; You see, and and and and if that ain't enough, people aren't keeping their vows. They just simply avoid them all together. &gt;&gt; And the breakdown of marriage is not just a social issue. I want you to know it's a spiritual crisis. And it affects churches. It affects homes. It affects nations. And when when a generation stops making covenant, it loses its understanding of God's covenant love. As the Bible said, and I want you to get this, in the last days, men shall be lovers of their own selves &gt;&gt; without natural affections, truth breakers. That means they break their covenants. &gt;&gt; So you had in 1916 only 5% of births were out of wedlock. In 1996 it was over 32%. Today it's even climbed way higher than that. You see the the prevalence of homes without a father has even more than doubled since 1960. You you see God ordained marriage. He ordained a father to be in the home to to guide his family in righteousness. He ordained a mother to nurture her children in truth and and and and to raise children who are a testament to the presence of the living God in their home. &gt;&gt; You see, I I don't believe the gospel is something that we just talk about. I don't believe it's something that we just do at church. I tell you, it's got to be lived at home. &gt;&gt; And if they ain't lived at home, it's a worthless religion. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham warned over a half century ago of a of a powerful alien, this power, this powerful alien power that was taking over this nation. And it wasn't Russia. It wasn't communism. It wasn't from a a foreign land. It was from the pits of hell itself. And he called it the invasion of the United States. Go listen to it. It's a great sermon to hear. But but but these were not armies of men, but demonic forces that were infiltrating the schools, the colleges, the pulpits, the airwaves, the social media, and the home. And you know, Paul saw this too. He warned, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, &gt;&gt; but we are wrestling against principalities and powers and against rulers of darkness of this world." That's what we're wrestling against. &gt;&gt; Amen. We send our kids to college, to a godless college, where they're brainwashed into this liberal thinking, and then we wonder what we did wrong. &gt;&gt; I tell you what you did wrong. Send them to college without the Holy Ghost. That's what you did wrong. &gt;&gt; We raised them to serve the Lord and then sent them over to a place where the devil has encamped and they get b brainwashed. &gt;&gt; And then the pediatricians, the doctors, they know it. That's why they they'll push the these vaccines on our our teenage boys and girls to prevent venerial disease because they know it's inevitable. &gt;&gt; They know it's going to happen. You see, but but they don't know the power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They don't know what we know. &gt;&gt; That there is a blood that cleanses from sin and takes sin desire away. &gt;&gt; But you know what is all this building toward? It's building toward a coronation. This world is about to crown its king. &gt;&gt; Not Christ, but Satan himself. the God of this world who will reign though it be briefly before the true king of kings descends in judgment but he'll reign for a while &gt;&gt; you can read the book &gt;&gt; you don't want to be here when Satan re reigns in full power &gt;&gt; amen but I'll tell you what sadly even us who walk in the light of this message we're not untouched by the spirit of this age too too many places too many things. We We see it happen too often. Not just not just I'm not just speaking to here, but even around the world. Divorce, broken homes, rebellion, drugs plague our own ranks. And guess what? A new breed of preachers have risen in the message saying the Eternals prescription don't work. Well, I'll tell you this. It worked for me &gt;&gt; and it works for everyone else who has taken it. &gt;&gt; But if it's not working, then there is two things. There's either two things. Either one, people are refusing it. You try to give it to them and they spit it out between your fingers. &gt;&gt; Or else there's quack drugist &gt;&gt; who have messed with the prescription, &gt;&gt; deluded the gospel to where it's powerless. &gt;&gt; Yeah, the enemy has targeted our families. &gt;&gt; And I I don't mean to to point a bl a bleak picture, but I do want to tell you friends, it's time to go home. This ain't home. This is more and more feeling. &gt;&gt; It's an uncomfortable feeling. &gt;&gt; We don't belong here. &gt;&gt; We're an endangered species. &gt;&gt; And we we see the enemy targets our families cuz he knows that the home is the first church. It's the foundation of faith. Yet in the midst of this darkness, I still say there is a bride &gt;&gt; who will not bow to bail. &gt;&gt; And but we must be watchful and we must we must be awake because the world we look around and see our our communities, our our cities, our nation, they're all dying. And the world is dying. Why? Because the last plague is passing through the land. Just as Revelation foretold him, I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed him. &gt;&gt; That's the scripture. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, while death rides, life is rising. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where is it rising, brother Tim? In the hearts of the redeemed. The same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead still quickens his people. It makes you alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. And darkness may cover the earth, but the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. &gt;&gt; What a difference that is. &gt;&gt; There it is. One of the many promises of the glory and power of God rising on the end time people while we have a world grouping in darkness. Now, brother Bradom told us in the message the Israel at Kadesh Barnea that God is is finishing when God was finished preparing Moses and had trained him for the task that that he began to send forth the signs you know and and finally he come to the last sign and the last sign that the prophet declared you remember Moses did it was death it was it was not physical death first but but it's spiritual death now that has struck the church. And then of course it's the final plague is a church that was once vibrant and full of life now dying and blowing away. And we're living in that dreadful hour. You know, old-timers who once shouted the victory are growing weary. The altars that once burned with a holy fire, you know, now they stand cold. The blood once boldly displayed on the doorpost is now being wiped away in the name of modern religion. &gt;&gt; But the gospel still stands. When I see the blood, &gt;&gt; I'll pass over you. &gt;&gt; There is still the blood. &gt;&gt; There is still the token. There it is. The literal life of Jesus Christ that still atones. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know. We're in a world that's gone wrong. We are in a broken society. The church has not escaped its influence. And as ministers, we face battles we never imagined. I know I didn't imagine them when I started out. We've we face things, sin, compromise, broken homes, addiction, rebellion, it all trying to creep in. You know why? We're the last hold out. &gt;&gt; He's got all the others. &gt;&gt; So, he's got all his his guns trained on you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But and and yet I I I want to tell you as I'm preaching today, I believe every problem in the home, every problem in the marriage, every problem in the church can all be healed by true baptism of the Holy Ghost. If we ever needed a dose of the Holy Ghost, a refilling of his spirit, an outpouring of his presence, it's now we need that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I tell you, I know it can be healed. How do I know it worked for me? &gt;&gt; It worked for my children. &gt;&gt; Amen. In fact, it's worked for everyone who has received it. &gt;&gt; And look around. I want you to see what God's doing. I want you to look around and think just for a moment. Look at the miracles of healing. Look at the miracles of salvation. Drug addiction vanquished. You see alcohol, alcoholism conquered. U you know, prodals returning, homes restored. You you know what it tells me? The eternal prescription works. But just like brother Brandham said in the message choosing of the bride and let me quote this one. Don't let the devil ever cool you off from this. Stay right with it until you're ever one filled with the Holy Ghost in so much that we make you come to this word that'll make you women straighten up, make you men straighten up. If you say you got the Holy Ghost and won't cope with the word, it's another spirit in you. God's spirit is on his word. Messianic, the anointed word. The bride must be the Messiah, the anointed word. &gt;&gt; And yet, as I said, we've got preachers trying to offer a new prescription other than that of of the book of Acts experience. They they claim Acts two won't won't work. So, they they offer kids an education to combat their problems with sexual sins and fornication. But brother Brandham warned us of this. Amen. We've got it in the message. It foretold in Broken Sisters 1965. And again, I quote, "Education can never bring life. It takes the spirit of God to bring life. And life must not come out of just an intellectual revival. It's got to come out of the Bible of word revival. And the word is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And when it falls today and quickens, you get the same results you did in Acts two. Exactly. It always has and it always will be because it's the spirit of God that conditions the atmosphere. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, I want to make you sure there's nothing wrong with that great experience, that wonderful filling of the spirit of God, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It still works. &gt;&gt; It still atones. &gt;&gt; It still saves. The problem is they've tried to water it down with education and and and psychology to try to modify behavior. Oh, let me tell you the eternal prescription. It has the power of change. &gt;&gt; That's what sets it apart. It don't just modify. It has the power to make you a new creation. &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost, it burns out selfishness, burns out pride. It burns out bitterness. It restores love. It brings unity. It brings holiness. Amen. It gives men and women power to overcome, not just to survive. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said to him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne. You see, we are not called to be survivors here in Leodysia. We are called to be overcomers. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon saw that coming word, the revealed word of the hour that would produce a revival. &gt;&gt; But it wouldn't be a revival of tents and and crowds or citywide campaign. But he said it would take for this revival would take men and women called to God, a chosen generation. th those who would receive this word into their hearts and until that revival fire burned with him. &gt;&gt; That's what we want to see. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Tim, how can I get the revival fire in my life to burn higher?" I'll tell you, throw on more of the wood of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how Amen. No, we've got to have a revival that burns within our hearts. That's the kind of revival we're talking about. Not one in Tennessee, not one in Louisiana, not one in Ohio or Virginia, but one that's burning in the hearts &gt;&gt; of God's elect. &gt;&gt; Like the Welsh Revival when the dignitaries came to find out about the move of God that was taking place. And they found an old humble policeman that was humming him on the on the corner. And and they asked him, "Where was the move of God?" And he said, "It's right here. Here's a revival. &gt;&gt; It's on the inside of me. &gt;&gt; And that's where the revival's got to be. &gt;&gt; You want revival in a church? Let me tell you, churches don't get revival. It's people that get revival. It's sons and daughters of God that get on fire with the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. That's where the revival must be today is in the bride. And I want to just say, we're not waiting for another revival. &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for another messenger. &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for another message. &gt;&gt; We don't need a new breed of preachers in the message to give us something different. The bride's revival has already come. I could hear brother Bradam. I was there in 1965, Seport, Louisiana, and as a young boy, I heard him say it. The move is on for the bride. That's thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, God hadn't changed his mind. &gt;&gt; There is still a move on for the bride. &gt;&gt; The church may go backwards. The church may be backsliden. The world may go crazy, but there's a bride going forward. There's a people called by his name. There is a people who know their God and who will do exploits. &gt;&gt; We don't need something different. No. The rain, the former and the latter rain has already fallen. It fell together to bring a wheat bride to maturity. So let it be known. You know, there's nothing else coming. No new revelation, no new prophets. &gt;&gt; You see, you'll either receive this Holy Ghost or you'll perish. &gt;&gt; You'll either get the token or be left behind. Amen. &gt;&gt; The next great move. You want to know what it is, brother Tim? What do we expect? What is the next great move? The next great event on God's calendar is the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, we must do everything we can to pro to prepare for that coming. &gt;&gt; And if this word don't quicken you, if this Holy Ghost don't make you alive, then as a Gentile, there's no hope for you. There will not be another message to the gentile world. The door is closing. The times of the Gentiles are fulfilled already. The Bible said in second Peter 1:3, "His divine power hath given us all things that pertain to life and godliness. We have it. We have everything we need for the journey. The word is complete." Can I get an amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The spirit is present. Can somebody agree with that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? The bride is being made ready. And this is not the hour to look for something new. It's the hour to live out what's already been given. &gt;&gt; The same word that called the bride out will also call her up. &gt;&gt; But in 1958, the great revival, healing, revival was now about over. And brother Bradom looked forward with prophetic vision to the coming word, the great awakening that would rise in the bride of Jesus Christ. And he knew that this end time revival, it wouldn't be birthed by an may given way to another denomination or organized system like what we got at Jeffersonville now. Nor contained in church walls or committees. It would be something deposited in the hearts of men and women. It would be God called and God trained vessels, men and women who would carry the fire of that word and that would carry it to the ends of the earth. He would tell us in that sermon of God called man that we hear the cry of sincere hearts. And I mentioned this when I spoke on and I sought for a man just a couple of weeks ago. Anyway, there the call in many hearts for Lord send revival in our times and and truly that is still a cry that that that rises from the lips of believers today. It it moves the soul. It stirs the spirit. It quickens the heart because it's written and and actually I'm quoting from brother Brandham. He uses a scripture in 2 Chronicles 7:14. If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and heal their lands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see that promise that promise is still alive today. But as brother Brandon revive reminded this week, God can't send a revival until he first has men prepared to bear it. And you you say, "Brother Tim, there ain't no revival." Let me tell you, there is a revival. &gt;&gt; It's the bride's revival. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. And yet he can't send it to you until you're prepared to receive it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Before the fire falls, there's got to be an altar built. &gt;&gt; Before the outpouring, there has to be vessels that are prepared to contain it. &gt;&gt; You see, God needs men. God called men, God trained men, not men trained in seminaries or philosophies that are they're by polished by theology. Oh. Oh, man. You know, but what we need today is rugged men of faith. men who have met God, who have faced the fire, who knows that he's he's still alive, that he's the Almighty, to know he still heals and he still delivers. He still sets the captive free. &gt;&gt; Amen. As the psalm will say, some through the waters, and some through the floods, and some through the fire, but all through the blood. God purchases his children through testings. Oh my, haven't we all been through our share of testings, through deep valleys, through storms. Storms that sometimes seem to shake the very ground that's under our feet. Sometimes it takes years, but through it all, what has God doing? What has God been doing? He's been training an army for the front lines. &gt;&gt; And even now, God is raising up those very men and women. They, you know, there'll be warriors who who won't flinch in the heat of the battle, who will not quit when all seems lost. They are the Calebs. They are the Joshua of this generation whose hearts burn with a different spirit. They have seen the promise and they refuse to compromise. They refuse to turn back. They are the overcomers, the very ones that Jesus spoke of of this Leodysian age &gt;&gt; to them that overcometh. And he said, "On this rock, I'll build my church and I'm going to have a people that the gates of hell will not prevail against." &gt;&gt; How many can say, "I want to be in that group." &gt;&gt; Let me tell you who they are. They're not weary survivors. &gt;&gt; They're warriors. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm calling today is warriors. &gt;&gt; Warriors who who set their face toward the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as Jesus set his face toward the cross, we should set our face. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach. We should set our face toward the resurrection. &gt;&gt; The Lord that great rapture. &gt;&gt; A people right in the midst of this leodysian chaos. Amen. A bride who is rising. A people who will defeat Satan right in his own Eden. Because this is Satan's Eden. But in his Eden there is a bride. &gt;&gt; She not like Eve back in that pure Eden. She's here in Satan's Eden. And she will not fall. She will not compromise. She will stand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Paul said in Philippians 3:13, "Forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth, reaching forth unto those things which are before. I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling." What is our high calling? What has been laid before us? A resurrection. where all the dead in Christ will come forth. &gt;&gt; What lays before us? The rapture. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where we caught up to meet the Lord in the air. &gt;&gt; Do that was what lays before us. And as he said, I press toward the mark. &gt;&gt; So this is a generation that will break the cycle. They will face the gates of hell. They will overcome by the blood of the lamb. and the word of their testimony. I believe God has his men today. &gt;&gt; And I believe you are men and women that have been chosen. &gt;&gt; But there is a cycle. It's a it is a solemn sovereign cycle of revival and death that we were warned of as brother Brandham would began in that Ephesian church age tracing the pattern of generations through of Israel and and the history of the church. And he showed us how one age burns bright with the fire of God and with revival and zeal and purity and truth only for the next generation to let the flame flicker. He said in one generation is there revival in next it begins to fade. In the third it's only embers that remain. In the fourth not even a trace of the original flame can be found. Then God must light the fire again. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's a tragic pattern of man's history with God. No matter what he called the manifestations of the truth. You You see, it's what it's what he called what brother Brandham described as a manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren. &gt;&gt; Each generation has to be born again for itself. You see, you cannot inherit the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You must experience him personally. &gt;&gt; Amen. As the Psalmist said, uh, you know, wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee? You look back through the through the church ages behind us of Ephesus and Smyrna and Pergamus and Thyra and Sardis and Philadelphia and now Leodysia. And you'll see that same cycle repeated again and again. Each revival begins in power. It ends in formality. It dies in apathy. But there is one difference. And I want you to get this. Let this ring loud and clear to you. We have reached the end. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There is no eighth age coming. Time has run out. &gt;&gt; The seventh church age is the final one. &gt;&gt; The messenger has sounded his message. The son of man has already revealed himself to his prophet and continues to do so through his bride. &gt;&gt; And the word has already been restored. &gt;&gt; And there is not another age &gt;&gt; to carry the flame. &gt;&gt; It must be this one. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, let me remind you what he said to your age, Leoa. To him that overcometh. Let's put it up. Revelation 3:21. To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and have sat down with my father in his throne. You see, there has to be somebody that fulfills the scripture. &gt;&gt; I wonder when you see to him that overcometh, are you reading your name in it? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know you're going to do it, brother T. Hey, that ain't going to help you. What about you? &gt;&gt; I can't drag you along on my coattails. &gt;&gt; I can't pull you into heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going to have to see yourself in this scripture to him that overcometh. &gt;&gt; Amen. That may might mean getting dirty. &gt;&gt; That might mean getting getting smoke in your face and battling with scarred and wounded. I don't know what all it'll do. But I tell you this, you've got to make up your mind. I am fighting this battle to the end. &gt;&gt; And I will not come out of here a defeated individual. I'm going to come out of here more than a conqueror. I don't care what's in my family. I don't care what's in my past. I only know my future. And this is my future. My future is him that overcometh. Why will scrap to sit with me in the throne? The throne is my future. &gt;&gt; Sin may have been your past. Failure may have been your past. Trouble may be in your past, but that's not your future. &gt;&gt; And you can't let your past define who you are. &gt;&gt; It is your future that defines who you are. &gt;&gt; There will be somebody who overcomes Leodysia. &gt;&gt; There will be a bride, the lamb's wife, who sits with him in the throne, who conquers the last deception, who breaks the cycle of revival and death. once and for all. &gt;&gt; This is a people in whom Christ will have the victory. A people in whom the word has preeminence &gt;&gt; and in whom the spirit has full headship. They are the ones who will not just talk revival. Let me tell you, they will be the revival. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of people talking about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm tired of just preaching and and it never manifesting. I I I tell you it's time we be the revival. &gt;&gt; Though the world decays, no churches fall asleep. This word cannot fail. God's promises cannot return to him void. &gt;&gt; This is the last word to the last church age, and somebody's going to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll have a bride, a church without spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such thing, and somebody's going to do it." Yes, sir. And Paul wrote, "To those that are alive and remain at the coming of the Lord, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, shall be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air." &gt;&gt; That means, you know what that means? That means there's a living people, &gt;&gt; a people that's alive, &gt;&gt; amen, in this final hour that are not overcome by sin, not subdued by darkness, but quickened by the very life of Christ himself. They are the overcomers who will not go the way of history. They will not die out and oh cold formal religion. They will keep alive the fire of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you for church, it's so important in this day and hour to really focus on why and what we have been called for in this hour. &gt;&gt; Because there must be a people that break the cycle. Yes, &gt;&gt; they're the ones who carry the torch not to pass it to another generation, &gt;&gt; but all the way to the finish line. They're the embodiment of every prophecy that have been spoken about by bride of a bride. They're the living word made flesh. So, this is the bride's hour. But I want you to notice something. There's always two kinds of people in every age. And in this same Leodysian age, there are there are those who break the cycle of bride without spot or wrinkle, without blemish. And there are those who never do. One group rises in the power of his word and walks in victory and the other drifts into formality. Content with religion without fire. Creates that statements of faith without spirit. Profession without possession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you and I both know. You and I both know this spotless condition where he said, "I'll have a bride without spot." We know that don't come from our own righteousness. &gt;&gt; No, it comes by grace alone. &gt;&gt; As he said, Ephesians 2:8-9, he said, "For by grace you're saved through faith, not of works, lest any man should boast." &gt;&gt; So the bride stands pure, not because she's perfect in her own self, but because she's washed &gt;&gt; in the blood of the lamb. Yeah, we got a whole multitude without number that is spoke of in the book of Revelation who goes to the tribulation who will face the judgments of God that are these judgments will be poured out on the earth as a time of God's wrath. God actually stored up the judgments of the past ages to pour out upon the Horish system, the harlot churches and and and the the the seed of the beast and and he stored them up and these vials will be poured out or they're spoken of vials in King James or bowls of judgment, but they're vessels stored up of judgment. God waiting until the bride is gone. to pour these things out. &gt;&gt; And you know why will he pour it out is why will they go through this rather you know because they though they were religious they never broke the cycle. They never went beyond tradition in the the fullness of the new birth. And brother Bradom told us this is a repeated process the rising and the fading of revival. And as I said, he he made it clear. It's a manifestation. God only has sons and daughters. God has no grandchildren. &gt;&gt; So salvation is not inherited. &gt;&gt; You know, it cannot be passed on intellectually. &gt;&gt; Everyone must have their own experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it has to be like John 1:13, which are born not of of not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor the will of man, but of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why we got to have men and women born of God, &gt;&gt; not of their own will, not of blood, not something they inherited. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you know, Brother Brandham told us you start out with two born again believers. Next generations comes, they're no longer plain believers, but now plain Christians. They take on a denominational name, a Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal, and that's exactly what they become. Not Christians, but church members &gt;&gt; until churches fulfill the scripture that they are caves of every unclean and hateful bird. unconverted people &gt;&gt; fill in the pews &gt;&gt; in the name of religion &gt;&gt; mean contrary sick never overcoming &gt;&gt; I don't want to pastor that kind of people &gt;&gt; they ain't pastorable &gt;&gt; Amen I want to see pe men and women filled with the Holy Ghost the fire of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm not talking about something even 20 years ago. I'm talking about people with a fresh and upto-date experience. &gt;&gt; A people today who are alive and on fire and are burning. &gt;&gt; People who have zeal and passion. Now listen church. And as I preach this, you know, I I I just going to bring this little quotation down. And he says, "That fervent desire to please God, the passion to know his word, the hunger to walk in the spirit, it begins to fade and the church that was once on fire becomes cool and formal and respectable." Now listen, this is very special to me. What what I'm preaching today is is very special to me. And you'll know why. Because when I many years ago in the infancy of this church where I I preached from this very same text back in 1976, it was on April the 4th. We were there meeting in an old building that wouldn't hardly that wouldn't hold the the light or the window lights or the window panes. It was the wood had decayed around it. We were always had to replace it. Songs were written about us in old country church with broken window pains, you know, thing things like that. And and they was sung, you know, how they they saw Christ back in a manger in a cattle stall. The the church world didn't want him. And anyway, you know, in in that moment, on that day, it was April the 4th, 1976, preaching on this very same subject. The spirit of God moved. The altars were full, and that day that that many years ago now, my wife received the baptism of the Holy Ghost that changed her life forever. Brother Jerome who Buts who became one of the the first deacons, the first elected deacons in our church and and served for so faithful for so many years. He received the baptism of the Holy Ghost that very day. I would take him down to Old Tisley Pond and baptize him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And it's even more significant today. Today would have been Sister Karen's 67th birthday. But you know what? In heaven, there's no birthdays. &gt;&gt; So, I don't wish her a happy birthday. &gt;&gt; You only have birthdays here. &gt;&gt; When you're there, it's just one great big joy. &gt;&gt; We never grow old. And I realize standing right here at this very same place on this scripture, loved ones that are there, &gt;&gt; loved ones that made it over &gt;&gt; were the result of this kind of preaching. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But you see, this was the problem with Ephesus. They began with power. They ended with formality. Their first love was dying. But God's word still cries out. 2 Corinthians 6:17. Come out from among them and be separate, sayith the Lord. Touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you. You see, it's not the hour then to cool off or to blend in. It's the hour to stand out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To be a called out chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people. I tell you what, you need to let the world know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the fire that once burned at Pentecost burn in you again. Let this bride be different, not just in doctrine, but in fire, in holiness, in a passionate love for the word of God. For you are called to a high calling. &gt;&gt; Put back Revelation 3:21 again. I just want to hold this. Somebody's going to sit with him on the throne. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you while you're looking at that scripture. There is no higher calling. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; On this earth, &gt;&gt; no higher calling &gt;&gt; than to be the bride of Jesus Christ. It is the greatest privilege ever offered to mortal man to be chosen, redeemed, united with the eternal bridegroom himself. &gt;&gt; This calling, let me tell you, it is higher. It is higher than the calling of a prophet. &gt;&gt; It is higher than the calling of a priest, higher than the sacred office of a pastor or teacher, apostle, or name any of them. &gt;&gt; For the bride is not merely a servant. She's the wife of the lamb. &gt;&gt; She shares his name. Hallelujah. She shares his nature. Amen. She shares his throne and therefore she shares his glory. &gt;&gt; So if you ever been called by that holy call and then walk worthy of it. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm asking. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:1, walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called. You're not called to be an ordinary believer. &gt;&gt; I want you to get it. &gt;&gt; You're not an ordinary believer. &gt;&gt; You're not just an ordinary denominational benchwarmer. &gt;&gt; That's not what you've been called to. You have been handpicked by grace in the to stand in the most intimate relationship possible &gt;&gt; with the Lord of glory. You wear his name. You have his life. You carry his word. You bear his image. &gt;&gt; Think of it. He's the bridegroom. You're the bride. There is no higher honor on earth than to be bone of his bone &gt;&gt; and flesh of his flesh. &gt;&gt; You got a sacred responsibility. Amen. You got a responsibility to live worthy of that name to reflect his holiness, his purity, his love, his truth. Yeah, it's a dark hour, but you must be the light in it. &gt;&gt; You must mirror as the bride. You must mirror the groom. What a privilege that is. But now as we as we look at this this morning, I I want to hurry on because I want to I want to get some to some things today is because I want you to understand that no matter where you are, you may be cold and different, backsliding, I don't know. You may be one of those on fire for God. You may just need a little more of the wood put on your fire. Burn it a little higher. I don't know where you are, but let me just say, what is the way back? How do we break the cycle of revival and death? This answer, it's as old as it is powerful. The way back is the way of repentance. Did you know that in the Leodysian age, our age, his direct message to you was to be zealous to repent? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you would have a seal to have a seal, to repent &gt;&gt; every time you face the word of God, you repent. &gt;&gt; And you don't look to change it. You don't look for compromise. You don't look for an easy way out. You just repent. &gt;&gt; You just say, "God, you're right. I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm ready to change. &gt;&gt; I'm re, you know, if you're telling me I need more of the Holy Ghost than Lord, put out, let me put out everything that keeps me from it. Let me get more of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Whatever you say, God, &gt;&gt; I don't want a self assessment of myself like Leodia does. I don't need it. But I want to be constantly looking, examining my life. Where could I button up a little? How could I please him more? You know, some of you say, "Well, I I don't understand, Brother Tim. I don't understand. I I You know, sometimes people say, "Well, I I don't understand this about not wearing makeup, and I don't understand about not cutting our hair. I don't understand why we can't cross-dress and and wear men's clothes. I don't understand why. I don't understand. I don't It ain't about understanding. &gt;&gt; You're expecting it to be reasonable according to today's standards of society &gt;&gt; and you'll never understand it. That's right. &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, then what's the solution, brother Tim?" Love. &gt;&gt; If I get you to do one thing, go, you know, when he when he said to Israel, Israel said, "Tell us what to do. We'll do it." &gt;&gt; God didn't want a law. He wanted love. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "If a man, if you will love me with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your being, &gt;&gt; and when you love God so much, &gt;&gt; you don't care whether you understand it or not, &gt;&gt; you just know that don't please him and you want to please him &gt;&gt; because he said, "If you love me, keep my commandments. Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't understand. It ain't about understanding. &gt;&gt; It's about love. &gt;&gt; You know, you got a husband and he don't like lemon pie. You don't force it to him to have it on his birthday cuz he don't like it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If he don't like it, you don't serve it to him. &gt;&gt; That's right. Well, I don't understand. I love it. Well, it has nothing to do with how you love. It's him. Don't like lemon pie. &gt;&gt; And then that's me. I don't like lemon pie. My wife loved it. She can make it for herself anytime she wanted, but I didn't. Don't serve it to me. &gt;&gt; You know, don't give it to me for my birthday. &gt;&gt; It's not going to make me happy. You know, and when we're talking about the bridegroom and we read in his word, don't come to him dressed and acting and doing things that, you know, offends him. &gt;&gt; If he said it's an abomination for a man to wear a woman to wear man's garments or God hates it, &gt;&gt; well, I don't think this loving father this God said I hate it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, why does he die?" And you know, it don't even matter. &gt;&gt; It don't even matter. &gt;&gt; And when you get in love, &gt;&gt; it won't matter to you either. &gt;&gt; You won't care. You won't care whether he wants his edge fried or scrambled. You won't care. You just want to please him. You want to make this marriage work. You want to make heaven your home. Come on, somebody help me preach. Amen. You get so in love with him, you don't want to grieve his Holy Spirit one time. I don't want to do one thing that would offend him. &gt;&gt; But the way is the way of repentance. &gt;&gt; It's not an emotion, intellect, nor not in reformation. It's in a broken heart, a contrite spirit. Here, listen. Psalms 51:17. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit and a broken and contrite heart. Oh God, thou wilt not despise. You see, repentance, it brings us back to our first love. It it breaks the It breaks that pattern of decline. It restores the fire that once burned in the upper room. if we'll humble our hearts and and remember and return the the cycle will be broken. Life will flow again. So now think about this. If a sinner has to come to God by the way of repentance and they must, then how much more the lukewarm, the backslider, the complacent believer repent. The the sinner comes from darkness to light, but the backslider turns away from light into darkness and they got to repent. &gt;&gt; And his repentance must cut deeper. When a backslider comes back, he's got to even have a it must even cut deeper. It's got to go deeper than what it was in the in the first time &gt;&gt; that it roots out sin. &gt;&gt; So it must it must cut deeper. Is somebody with me? &gt;&gt; John the Baptist cried in Matthew 3 and8 bring forth fruit meat for repentance. &gt;&gt; What was he saying? Prove it by your life. &gt;&gt; Don't just confess it with your lips &gt;&gt; and you don't confirm it by your walk. Amen. True repentance is not tears, it's turning. &gt;&gt; You You see, it's not emotion, it's transformation. &gt;&gt; You see, God born say, "If you don't repent, I'll remove your candlestick." &gt;&gt; In other words, in other words, I'll take the light away from you. I I'll remove your faithful messengers, your faithful shepherds. I'll leave you to yourself. And that's a dreadful thing to be left to yourself. to have religion without re revelation, to have form without fire, to have words without witness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yet you can still talk about Christianity and sing about and preach about it, but be bereft of it. It'll be kabad &gt;&gt; written over the door. The glory has departed. &gt;&gt; Now look, that happened to Ephesians, the the city of Ephesus. Its symbols of beauty and wealth are now nothing but stones and overgrown ruins. The harbor that once welcomed ships now is a marsh. Population dwindled to a handful of unbelievers living among the relics of what was of what was once was. But let me tell you, she could have repented. &gt;&gt; You know, God would have restored her. God would have God would have restored, but she had to humble herself. &gt;&gt; And it and this doesn't mean that we can't repent. We can, but it must be quickly. As Hebrews 3:15 said, "Today, if you will hear his voice, &gt;&gt; if you'll harden not your heart," you see, it's got to be a true heart cry to God. Not not a ritual, not a formality, but a cry that is that is born out of sorrow, a longing for restoration. And if you do that, God will answer from heaven. He'll restore what is lost. The glory will return. It's repentance that breaks the cycle. &gt;&gt; But you see, sin has got to be dealt with. I'm going I'm going to hurry up, but I'm still going to take my time. Now, that's a paradox, but I just want to say sin must be dealt with, &gt;&gt; not covered up. &gt;&gt; It must be exposed, confronted, and cut off. &gt;&gt; Well, you cannot make peace with sin. &gt;&gt; You can't play with the flesh. Let me tell you, sin is deadly. &gt;&gt; It's not a pet. It's a predator. &gt;&gt; It's like a wild animal that will destroy you if you ever dare to feed it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Years ago years ago, I was up in Bamp up in Canada. I took a little trip and I preached a meeting there with brother Hilderbrandt in in his church. My wife and I went up there with him and we went up into the mountains afterwards there into B and Jasper. If you've ever been there, it's beautiful. It's a little place of heaven. They took my my wife and me sightseeing through those beautiful mountains. I kept seeing these signs and along the road and I'm a sign reader, you know. I I'll read them right out loud, you know, and I have to be careful cuz some of them ain't worth reading, but I it's kind of habit of mine. I'll look at that sign and I'll read it right out loud. And the signs were saying, "Don't feed the animals. a $1,000 fine. Well, I read every one of them. I'd see it again. Don't feed the animals. $1,000 fine. Well, Brother Hilden Brandt finally said, "Hey, you know what that that's about? You know why those signs are posted?" I said, "No." Well, because the tourists forgot the bears were wild. &gt;&gt; And he told me that people would see cute bears and and think they were tame, you know, just big furry friends. and and sister Marlene, you know, said, "Yeah, I've even got pictures of photos of of um said, Harold, run out and snap the picture where I was feeding a big big mammoth bear through a little crack in my window." I just rolled it down just enough to slip a cracker or something out. Now, you know, I'm Louisiana redneck, I guess. So, I thought, "How dumb is that?" I mean a little tiny piece of glass between you and a wild animal there feet in there and it open about an inch rem and separated by just this thin piece of glass. That's pretty stupid. &gt;&gt; But you know one man he got so carried away he put honey on his little daughter's hand &gt;&gt; so that the bear could come would come up and lick it off. But the bear mot wanted more than the honey. &gt;&gt; It took the child and mauled it. After that, laws were passed. Don't feed the animals. &gt;&gt; Now, friends, what's this about? Your flesh is just like that. It's an animal. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It is wild. &gt;&gt; Oh, not mine, brother Tim. It's born again. No, it ain't. &gt;&gt; It's not converted &gt;&gt; and it never will be. &gt;&gt; Ah, you can't tame it &gt;&gt; and you can't trust it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't make peace with it. &gt;&gt; You can only keep it under the word and under the Holy Ghost. That's all you can do. &gt;&gt; You got to Oh, come on now. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to have the Holy Ghost on the inside, the throne of your heart. &gt;&gt; And you're going to have to be like Adam who ruled the wild beast in Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. The lion had its nature. Lamb had its nature. And when the lamb, the lion rose up to take the lamb, Adam, the god of the earth, sit down, boy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, he kept the peace. &gt;&gt; He kept the harmony. And it made an Eden around him. Now, if you want heaven around you, &gt;&gt; come on, you got to realize that your flesh is just an animal. Is not converted. You can't make peace with it. You've got to keep it under the word and the Holy Ghost. Amen. There's got to be the Holy Spirit sitting on the throne of your heart. &gt;&gt; Come on. Bringing a millennium of peace in your heart. I'm not trying to put you in the millennium now, but I'm talking about a rain of peace in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what then? Bringing subduing the earth around you. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's what God told Adam to do. I'm going to give you this and you reign here and you reign and and you subdue everything around you until the whole earth would be in Eden. &gt;&gt; Now that's what God wants for you. &gt;&gt; He puts he puts Christ on the throne of your heart. Gives you the power to put an Eden around you. &gt;&gt; Now hold that. Now, let me just show you in 1 Corinthians 9:27. Here's the Apostle Paul, sanctified, Holy Ghost fil man. I keep my body, I keep under my body and bring it into subjection. What Paul said, I keep my body and bring it into subjection. &gt;&gt; In other words, don't feed the animal. You see, don't feed it with lust, pride, bitterness, jealousy, anger, self-will. Because if you feed it, it'll rise up. It'll destroy you. It'll destroy your home. It'll destroy your marriage. It'll destroy your ministry. It'll destroy your walk with God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sin will always take you further than you want to go. &gt;&gt; It'll keep you longer than you wanted to stay. &gt;&gt; And it'll cost you far more than you ever intended to pay. Because sin pays its wages. &gt;&gt; The wages of sin is death. &gt;&gt; And that's why God sent set boundaries. And those boundaries are not to restrict your joy, &gt;&gt; but to protect your life. &gt;&gt; The the word of God with the power of the Holy Ghost, it's like a fence that that keeps the beast behind the bars. You see, that's why holiness is preached. Listen, people get the wrong idea about holiness. They they think it's man's control. &gt;&gt; Like like some poor little woman come to church and she come around and you know she she she learned we were the ladies wore dresses church so she changed her dress. She started wearing dress to church. Then then we had a work day and she said her husband said, "Well, we're going to go help them at evening light. You don't do a little work day today. I'm sure the women will be in their pants, which they went and they was all in their skirts. So, she went to some of them and said, "Listen, Brother Tim seems to be reasonable. He seems to be a very kind man. And I think if we would all talk to him, he would let us wear pants and cut our hair. You know, he let us He's He's reasonable. Well, you know, it's like this. I didn't make the rules &gt;&gt; and I can't change them. &gt;&gt; If God says something in his word, I can't go back on it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is somebody with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. But the but that's why holiness preach. It's not man's control or rules. It's God's mercy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, we we teach things. We teach you young people not to kiss and hug and all of that and have in intimacy before marriage. Why do we do that? You say, "Well, you're restricting us." No, we are holding back sin. &gt;&gt; We know the flesh is weak. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm Holy Ghost fil, but I'm not going to meet with you sisters in my office &gt;&gt; by yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know better than to do that. I mean, hey, you know, even if I would behave, and I believe I would, I believe the Holy Ghost would keep me, &gt;&gt; but let me tell you, I'm not going to bring a shame on his name. I don't want no question on him. &gt;&gt; That's the same way you should be. &gt;&gt; Some of the ladies send me a text and you know, I'll include my son on it and they answer, "Why? I'm protecting him. I'm protecting his name. I don't want to bring reproach. So you see the Bible said in Galatians 5:16, "Walk in the spirit and you'll not walk fulfill the law of the flesh or the lust of the flesh." So the danger is not outside, it's inside. The unbridled flesh is the greatest enemy you'll ever face. and and and and that's what Paul said that they that are Christ and Galatians 5:24, they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust. So you got to keep those animals behind the bars, the bars of the word, the the the cage of obedience, the restraint of the Holy Ghost. You don't feed it. You don't play with it. You don't excuse it. Do one thing. Crucify it. &gt;&gt; Keep it dead. &gt;&gt; Let the word keep it bound. Let the spirit of God rule &gt;&gt; in your life. &gt;&gt; Now, that's not bondage. That's freedom. That's not legalism. That's life. &gt;&gt; Oh, people say, "I, brother Tim, you're the most legalistic preacher I ever saw or heard of." I'll tell you what, I'm not &gt;&gt; legalist. I didn't legalize sin. &gt;&gt; The devil did. &gt;&gt; So, I'm not the legalist. &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what the word of God said. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, you know, and and let me carry this further. We got a little time. &gt;&gt; You when you were born again, when you were filled with the Holy Ghost, did that take every natural passion of the flesh away from you? No. Of course not. If it did, there would never be a godly husband and a wife bring forth children in this world. The new birth doesn't remove human desire. It redeems it and brings it under divine control. &gt;&gt; You You see Hebrews 13:4 said, "Marriage is honorable and all and the bed undevoured, but mongers and adulterers God will judge." &gt;&gt; You see, the Holy Ghost doesn't it doesn't erase your emotions. It sanctifies them. It don't kill desire. It channels it into God's ordained boundaries. You you see passion becomes purity then and love then becomes loyalty and intim intimacy becomes holy when it abides in the word and that's what grace does. Grace teaches us how to live disciplined holy spirit-led lives. That's what grace does. Oh, I know there are men who want to turn grace into lasciviousness. But Titus 2:1 said, "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world." &gt;&gt; You see, but sin's got to be dealt with. The works of the flesh, lust, pride, rebellion, anger, jealousy, envy, it all must be crucified and not coddled. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're not and they, let me get this, they are not managed by willpower. &gt;&gt; They are not managed through lessons and sessions of behavioral modification. They are conquered through repentance &gt;&gt; and by the power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Somebody be with me now. The Bible said Galatians 5:25, "If we live in the spirit, let us walk in the spirit." So if we are the power of the Holy Ghost in us, we can live in the spirit and walk in the spirit. &gt;&gt; That's where there is no condemnation. when we walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. &gt;&gt; You see Galatians 5:24 said, "They that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust." So yeah, when you were born again, God didn't remove your humanity. He gave you the spirit to rule it. &gt;&gt; He didn't take away passion. He gave you purpose. &gt;&gt; He didn't erase your emotions. He gave you power to govern them. &gt;&gt; And that's what the Holy Ghost does. It it takes what once ruled you and it puts it under the dominion of Christ. &gt;&gt; And the only way to keep it that way is the same way we started. Repentance. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why Paul said, "I die daily." &gt;&gt; You see, that's the first dose of the eternal prescription. Repent. And and you see, as I said, sin and pride, the flesh, it must be dealt daily with at the altar until the only life that remains is Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; And that repentance &gt;&gt; must be genuine. &gt;&gt; Get it now? Because this is an age of shallow emotion, quick fixes where everything is just superficial. I know what I'm talking about. Let me tell you that true repentance, the kind that comes from a broken and a contrite heart, a total surrender of will and desire, that has now been watered down. It's watered down to nothing more than, "Oh, we just turn over a new leaf. We'll just join a church. We make a resolution. We attend special meetings. We'll kneel a few minutes at the altar." But let me tell you, that won't help you. &gt;&gt; It won't last. And you can make every promise under heaven. You can go to promisekeepers. You can sign cards. You can stand before other men and pledge, I'll do better. But unless your nature has changed, &gt;&gt; you'll go right back to doing the same old things again. The same thing you always done. Why? Cuz there's no king called Christ on your throne to say, "Down, boy." &gt;&gt; When your flesh rises up, &gt;&gt; you see, a man's got to be born again. He'll never understand the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you want to understand, we'll get born again. &gt;&gt; Then understanding comes, &gt;&gt; but you'll read self-help books. You'll learn positive philosophies. You'll even sit under good teaching like we have at this church. But if if sin nature is not dealt with and crucified, all the training of the world will not change your life. The Romans 8:13 said, "If you live after the flesh, ye shall die. But if you through the spirit do mortify, that means kill, kill dead, the disease of the body, you shall live. &gt;&gt; You see what you got to do. &gt;&gt; But everything is superficial." Ah, turn a new leaf instead of become a new creature. The Bible said in 2 Corinthians 5:17, "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away and behold, all things become new." But you know, we change that with modern religion until we have countless impersonations of the new birth. Come shake a hand with the preacher, kneel at the altar, minute, go confess, get baptized, you know, all these stuff. And people claim to be born again and have never yet experienced the death of the old man. &gt;&gt; Well, to be born again means you have to die. To be resurrected to new life means the old life died. And so the sacred experience of the cleansing of the soul, the forgiveness of sins, it's just been reduced to church joining. Oh, we just come join your church, Brother Tim. It won't help you. You'll go to hell like everybody else. I'm just making a profession of faith. Well, I believe the message. But belief without the new birth is still unbelief. &gt;&gt; That's what people don't get. Belief without the new birth is still unbelief. &gt;&gt; And the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been downgraded to mere emotionalism or either that just a shallow confession. But let me tell you, it's not excitement. It's not enthusiasm. And it's not an intellectual conception. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a mental ascent that it's the truth. It's deity. That's what it is. It's deity. It's God himself to come and live and dwell on the inside of that man or woman. &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you. &gt;&gt; You see, that's the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. When Christ takes over, but repentance, now listen to me. Repentance is not saying, "I'm sorry." That's a good start, but I got something to say to you. And you say, "I'm sorry." I say, "You're right. You are sorry. Now repent." &gt;&gt; Ah, brother Tim. You see what happens is often I'm sorry means I'm sorry I got caught &gt;&gt; or or or maybe I'm sorry because of the pain that I'm experienced because of my wrongdoings but never turning from the wrong. You see let me tell let me show you a scripture. 2 Corinthians 17:10, "Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death." You can just keep that up for a minute. So true repentance is what? Godly sorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see, that's what it is. It's when your heart breaks. That's good. &gt;&gt; Not because I lost my wife and I lost my kids and I lost this and I lost my money and I lost, you know, and I'm so dead drunk and I'm just And you're just sorry about the condition that sin brought you into, but you're not sorry of the sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. Repentance is when your heart breaks because you know you grieve the Holy Ghost. When you fall before God in anguish, and you're no longer defending yourself, &gt;&gt; you're not excusing your failure, but you're crying, "Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit in me, because it's against thee, and thee only have I sinned. You see, Esau sought repentance with tears, but he couldn't find it because he wanted the blessing without brokenness. Many will do the same today. They throw away their birth right with sin and pretending then is as if nothing nothing happened. I throw away my birthright, but I still want the blessing. God still blessed me. They want their reputation restored. They want their position recovered. They want their influence re renewed, but not their heart cleansed. You see, again, godly sorrow workketh repentance to salvation, not to be repented of, but the sorrow of the world workketh death. So you see, it's not a nobody's perfect. &gt;&gt; That don't bring salvation. &gt;&gt; Well, everybody else makes mistakes, too. You know what it is? Is Lord have mercy on me. I'm a sinner. &gt;&gt; I need Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. The moment we start justifying our sins by pointing to the failures of others, that's when repentance dies. God will not accept that he's calling for a bride who does not excuse her sin but overcomes it. &gt;&gt; Hear me now. I want to say to you overcome because you are not called to quit. You are called to conquer. &gt;&gt; You're not to called to explain your failure. You are called to rise in victory. You're called to defeat Satan on his own grounds right here in Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; God did not rise you up today to be passive and compromising and contempt with live lives some devil in your life. Do you know that people today have grown accustomed to coexisting with their bondage? They've learned to live with attitudes and appetites that that the cross was meant to crucify. &gt;&gt; You You see, some will excuse a temper. Well, my daddy had one. Others will justify a spirit of lust or pride or worldliness that manifests itself in countless ways. Anger, vanity, stubbornness, gossip, rebellion, self-will. But I listen to me now. You're not called with to live with that. The Bible said in Ephesians 4:27, "Neither give no place to the devil." &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham prayed one time and he said, "God, never let Satan crown me with an old crab indifferent spirit or my wife with a nagging spirit." Well, that's a prayer every one of us ought to pray. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he said, especially as we get older, we got pains in our body and we make excuse for our crabiness. and our contrariness and how mean we are and how ugly we are to others. &gt;&gt; Amen. This ain't a time to make excuses about your crabiness. It's a time to repent of it. &gt;&gt; Bring it to the altar and kill it. &gt;&gt; I preached like this in a convention one time in Ohio. And I tell you what, a man came to me and he came to me in that meeting. He walked up. He was an elderly man. He walked up and he said, "Brother Tim, you describe me. I've got that crab ugly spirit. I want it off of me. I come to repent today. &gt;&gt; I met him. I met him here just the other day. I don't know how he lived that long because he was an old man to me back then. He was still older. And he walked up to me and he said, "I'm that man that you prayed for 20 something years ago, Brother Tim, over that crabid spirit." And it's gone and is kept dead. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, the gospel will work. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to let it work. &gt;&gt; We want our lives instead of being crowned with a crabid spirit, we want to be crowned with the fruit of the spirit, with love and joy and peace and longsuffering and gentleness and goodness and meekness and temperance and patience. &gt;&gt; Oh my, that's a mark of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's the crown of character that we want. So, I'm telling you, don't excuse your temper &gt;&gt; just because your father had one. &gt;&gt; And let me just say to you, father, if you pass that down, God help you. The gospel should live in your home. &gt;&gt; Don't justify lust because men are just that way. Men are that way. But not Holy Ghost men. &gt;&gt; Don't explain it with your bitterness, your pride, your jealousy, or your worldly habits. Cuz I'm just human. &gt;&gt; That's not your nature anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Bible said, "Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are new." And when you're born again, you're filled with the Holy Ghost. No, it didn't take away your human emotion or natural desire. It redeemed it, though. &gt;&gt; And it brought it under control. And the Holy Ghost don't erase passion. It channels it in God's boundaries. &gt;&gt; If you're married, it makes marriage honorable in the bed undefiled. &gt;&gt; Amen. But otherwise, you're a harm and adulterer. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost don't don't destroy desire. It sanctifies it. It gives you a holy taste. How many heard thinking man's filter? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon preached on that. A thinking man's filter gives a holy man's taste. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you ever get the thinking man's filter of the Holy Ghost, it'll give you the taste for the things that are right. &gt;&gt; You see, but it don't kill your personality. It crucifies the fleshly nature that once ruled you. And it puts your emotions under the government of the word. And and if you're unmarried, it gives you the power to flee, to turn away from youthful lust. &gt;&gt; They that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections thereof and the lust. So I'm telling you, don't make peace with sin. &gt;&gt; You can't feed the flesh. You'll never tame it. It's untameable. And if you feed it, it'll rise up and destroy you and your testimony. So let me tell you, that's why holiness is preached, not as control, but as protection. &gt;&gt; The boundaries of the word will keep the beast behind the bars. &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll cause you to walk in the spirit so that you don't fulfill the lust of the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. that gives you power to overcome. Why? Because let me give you a simple scripture and it's a profound one. Not just simple, it's profound. Romans 6:14. For sin, listen to me. For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the law, &gt;&gt; but under grace. &gt;&gt; Now, let's get the first part. Sin shall not have dominion over you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Rule number one. &gt;&gt; Rule number two, it tells you why. Because you're not under the law. Now, why does Paul give this distinction? We're not under the law, but under grace. Because under the law, commandments was given to show us holiness, but not the power to live it. &gt;&gt; So, the law could not could point out sin, but it couldn't conquer it. In the old covenant, the worshipper offered a life of a innocent animal as a substitute. But that life that was shed in the altar could never return on the worshipper. And it could cover sin, but it couldn't change the sinner. &gt;&gt; But under grace, everything changes. &gt;&gt; This is why Paul said, "You're not under the law." The life of your sacrifice, the very life of Jesus Christ comes back upon the believer. It enters the soul and that empowers you to live above the dominion of sin. &gt;&gt; So grace doesn't excuse sin. It empowers you to overcome it. &gt;&gt; And the life that you that was once offered for you now which is Christ now lives in you and gives you the strength to rise above your shameful past. That's why you can break the cycle. Now, I'm I'm going to I'm going to just deal with a couple of more little points here and and then then we will bring this down to our close. But I want you I want you to get something. There's something else I want to deal with because some of you that are sitting right here are under the sound of my voice or will be hearing this later. You're carrying wounds that run deep. And and you say to me, "But brother Tim, you don't understand. You just don't know what happened to me." And you're right. I probably don't. You know that. But though I don't know it, I I don't doubt it for a minute. Those things were real. They were hurtful. They were wrongs. They were done to you. And I don't doubt you've been hurt and that you've been abused and mistreated some by parents who should have loved you. You went through horrible things. Broken homes, abandoned, forgotten, abused. Some by people who betrayed your trust. Some even by churches or pastors who were supposed to protect you. And many people will ask, why? Why? Why did God let this happen to me? and they look at the heartache, the sin, the disease, the brokenness in the world, and they wind up laying the blame at the feet of God. And they say, "If God is so great, if he cares, well, why didn't he intervene in my situation? Why did I go through this awful thing in my life that hurt me, that damaged me, that I'm this damaged goods as it was? Why did God, where was he when I went through all of that? But let's back up for a minute. I want you to remember God made a perfect world. That's how he made it. In six days he created an Eden of paradise. And there was no pain. There was no sorrow. There was no sin. There was no death. Everything was harmony. Man walking with God. Heaven and earth united. It was heaven on earth called Eden. But it wasn't God who ruined perfection. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Man did. &gt;&gt; Adam chose disobedience. He he reached for the fruit of death. And when he did, he sold the whole human race into the slavery to sin. And friends, none of us was born free. We were born in bondage, in sin, chained, slaved. &gt;&gt; And awful things happen to those that are in slavery. that they had nothing to do with &gt;&gt; things that they didn't want. Childhoods they didn't want abuses they never asked for. But what happened when Adam sold it the whole human race? That means he sold all his offspring to be slaves. to come under the bondage of sin and sin nature and for Satan to rule. And in doing so, he surrendered the whole earth and the dominion of the earth to Satan. &gt;&gt; And right now, Satan is the one who rules the earth. &gt;&gt; He is called the god of this world. He's called the god of this evil age. This is not heaven. &gt;&gt; This is not even. This is not the millennium. &gt;&gt; This is hell. &gt;&gt; I know there's a burning place, but let me tell you, if you're a Christian today, this is the closest to hell you'll ever come. And if you're not, then this is the closest to heaven you'll ever come. &gt;&gt; If you don't surrender your life to Christ, &gt;&gt; the Bible said in Romans 5:12, "For one by one man's sin entered into the world, and death by sin, so death passed on all men." And that's why there's murders, rapes, broken homes, fatherless children, and disease. Man's choice. It's not God's fault. It's the fault of man's sin. We were born in bodies that decay. We are we're born with minds that wrestle with sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. But God never has abandoned his creation. From the moment of the fall, he began to work on restoration. And that's why Jesus came. He came to redeem the soul, to begin the transformation that would one day prepare us for a perfect world again. He came to break the curse, to lift man out of death and bring him back to life again. &gt;&gt; Now listen, listen. We are here on earth and we're only here temporarily and for a time &gt;&gt; but already he started redemption &gt;&gt; and that redemption is in your soul. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Your body will still go still go through pains, through trials, through tests, through every kind of things and hell because we are not in a redeemed state in this body. It's our soul that has been redeemed. &gt;&gt; But glory be to God, he's not going to leave it that way forever. The dead in Christ shall rise first, &gt;&gt; and we that are alive and remain shall be caught up to meet the Lord in the air. For in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, we will be changed. &gt;&gt; And we'll no longer be in this obly body of flesh &gt;&gt; that is subject to trials and tests and abuses and hurts, &gt;&gt; but we'll be changed &gt;&gt; and we'll have a body like his own glorious body. one where only dwells righteousness. So right now you ask me, well then why don't God stop the tide of evil? Well, if he had did it on my time, it would have happened 50 years ago or more. 50 years I'll be flying to France and 50 years on the 23rd day of October I married my wife. We started out our life together have four wonderful children. If I would have chose I'd have wanted it to happen even before I got married. But God had four children in mind. But God only had four children in mind. He had their spouses in mind &gt;&gt; and they weren't even born. &gt;&gt; So if he'd have called it all to halt and there would have been no more sorrow and trouble and everything in all heaven. You see, you have to be born here. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; In order to be born again, &gt;&gt; in order to live there. So, we have been waiting on those whose names are in the lamb's book of life to be manifested on the earth. And then when the last one comes in, God will call a halt. &gt;&gt; But until he does, we don't want to leave a hook behind. &gt;&gt; I want you to go. If I can get you to go to heaven with me. I want you to go. I don't want to leave you behind. &gt;&gt; I want you there. &gt;&gt; It just wouldn't seem like heaven without you. Revelation 21:21. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. Revelation 21:1. I saw a new heaven and a new earth. And then he continues, "And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, and neither shall there be any more pain. Who's going to be there? Those who broke the cycle. Those who refused to let the past &gt;&gt; determine their future. &gt;&gt; Those who stood up and faced it and said, "This was given to me. This catastrophe in life, this abandonment, this hurt, this harm, it was all there. And Satan would use it to try to keep me down. But there was something greater on the inside of me. And that was the life of Christ that overcome. &gt;&gt; And I am an overcomer. I rise above it. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to stand there on that day as a champion of the grace of God, of his mercy, of his love, and I'm going to testify. You never left me in my hard time. You never walked away from me. You've been there throughout every trial, through every test. You always been there. You've never left me fighting alone. &gt;&gt; Cuz he said when he said Hebrews 13:8, which we know so well, he said in that same passage of scripture, I will never leave you or forsake you. Let's stand together. We're in a vicious fight. Living in an imperfect world. I wish I had the time to go on and to tell you of why that in this mind of yours there's still a battle. I'd like to be able to stand to you and tell you about the battleground and how to win that war. But I'm just going to simply tell you as the musicians have come and we begin to close this service. I'm just going to tell you very briefly that the attacks on your mind is not you. Is the enemy trying to pull you who are redeemed, &gt;&gt; bought with the blood, pull you down where you don't walk in victory. &gt;&gt; And if you don't recognize the voice of your enemy and silence him by the word, you will walk in defeat. The reason that cloud of depression is on you is not because God put it there. &gt;&gt; It's because you allowed Satan to keep it there when you were told to cast down strongholds &gt;&gt; and every imagination &gt;&gt; that exalts itself against the word of God. And I'm going to tell you right now, if you're going to break the cycle, you got to start it right there. You're going to have to take the word and break it. &gt;&gt; Disciple. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That war within your mind where the devil comes time after time bombarding you in your mind. You can't make it. You're not You're not who you say you are. You You're not worthy. You're not any count. You're no good. I'll tell you how good you are. He went to Calvary for you. He gave his life for you. He redeemed you by his blood. You are his blood washed, bloodbought son or daughter. the living God redeemed by the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Don't walk in defeat. &gt;&gt; You've been called to walk in victory &gt;&gt; and start with taking control of what's in your mind &gt;&gt; and bringing it subject to the word of God &gt;&gt; and say, "I can do all things through Christ that strengthenth me. I'm not a quitter. I am a winner. &gt;&gt; I am an overcomer. I will overcome. How? By the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; And by testifying what he said about me. &gt;&gt; So if he said he redeemed me, he redeemed me. If he saved me, he saved me. Amen. Whatever he said, I'm going to say yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Father, today as I've labored here long, as I've stood here in this pulpit now for a couple hours, I've done it, Lord, to try to deliver a word to these your children. Sometimes, Lord, we feel inadequate to be able to say it precisely. But I pray that it went, Lord, like an arrow to its target, hitting the bullseye. &gt;&gt; It was the arrow of deliverance that you put in my hand today. And I'm speaking deliverance over this people right now. I'm I'm I'm speaking to deliverance over that battle that's in their mind, that war that's in their flesh. I'm speaking to them deliverance today because there is a power of the overcomer that can rise in their heart, sit upon their throne, and cause them to be enthroned with him where they rule and they reign with Christ. Not just in the millennium ahead, but right now, Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus, you bless your children. Speak, Lord. Speak right now. Take the word, Lord. Let it be like a knife, a surgeon's knife that just goes out, cuts out unbelief. I pray, Lord, right here in Evening Light Tabernacle, there will be a repentance. A repentance starting from the pulpit to the back pew to all the way back. Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus that every heart will humble themselves before you so they can hear from heaven. I pray that today they'll take the sword of the word and they'll [Music] they will break through those clouds. There's a sun to shine. It's just clouds that's holding it back. There you are in your glory and your power. It's just clouds that are holding it back. Demonic powers, demonic influence, spirits of depression, things that want to cloud our minds, our hearts. But I pray, Lord, there will be a purging all the way today. That every cloud will be dispersed and your children can walk in victory. that every man, woman, boy, and girl in here can walk in freedom. Cuz though they were born in slavery, you came to set us free. And you said he that the son is made free is free indeed. Let them walk in that freedom today. In the name of Jesus. Amen. I am redeemed. Been bought with a price. Jesus has changed my whole life. Why don't you just worship him just for a moment? [Music] &gt;&gt; That's it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Jesus has changed my whole life. And if anybody asks you just who I am, tell them that I am redeemed. Sing it again. &gt;&gt; I will you make that confession.
