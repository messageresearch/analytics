[59:31] guarded and protected
[59:33] by the angel and we're just carrying
[59:36] this a little further today and
[59:38] going over some different points here
[59:40] that i want to
[59:41] uh make sure that the the holy spirit
[59:45] has the opportunity
[59:46] to to take that word and place it in
[59:48] your heart
[59:49] and so um exodus 23 verse 20 and we'll
[59:53] probably
[59:54] read from this chapter again a little
[59:56] later in the sermon today but it says
[59:58] behold i
[59:59] sent an angel before thee to keep thee
[1:00:02] in the way and to bring thee into the
[1:00:03] place
[1:00:04] which i have prepared but if thou
[1:00:07] shalt indeed obey his voice
[1:00:11] and do all that i speak then i will be
[1:00:14] an enemy unto thy enemies
[1:00:17] and an adversary unto thy adversaries
[1:00:21] amen god bless you can take your seats
[1:00:26] amen god bless you brother johnny love
[1:00:29] you brother johnny
[1:00:31] amen appreciate every word of
[1:00:33] encouragement this morning
[1:00:35] that's what we're here to do we were
[1:00:36] exhorted by the apostle paul
[1:00:38] to preach the word be instant in season
[1:00:41] out of season
[1:00:43] we prove rebuke with all long suffering
[1:00:45] and doctrine
[1:00:46] amen because the time would come when
[1:00:48] they won't endure some doctrine
[1:00:51] amen but they'll heap to themselves
[1:00:52] teachers have an itching ears
[1:00:55] but oh god help us in this day to endure
[1:00:58] the sound doctrine of the world let it
[1:01:01] change our lives
[1:01:02] amen god bless you last sunday we were
[1:01:05] speaking on the angel
[1:01:07] leading the church and how the pillar of
[1:01:10] fire led the old testament church
[1:01:13] by the angel of his presence
[1:01:16] we know that in as we have been through
[1:01:19] this that he spoke to moses
[1:01:21] in the burning bush we also see
[1:01:24] in the bible that he came to daniel in a
[1:01:27] time
[1:01:27] where the jews were returning to their
[1:01:29] homeland
[1:01:31] when it was an hour for them to leave
[1:01:33] babylon and return to the land
[1:01:35] of their inheritance and the angel
[1:01:38] appeared to daniel and said i
[1:01:40] am now come to give thee skill and
[1:01:43] understanding
[1:01:44] for thou art greatly beloved isn't it
[1:01:47] wonderful to be told
[1:01:49] you're greatly loved angel
[1:01:52] that led the the book of acts church we
[1:01:55] know that
[1:01:56] we're going back to a book of acts
[1:01:57] church that's what we are
[1:01:59] about another another branch has come
[1:02:02] forth from the vine
[1:02:04] and we will have to be then to be a book
[1:02:07] of acts church where we have to be
[1:02:08] led by the pillar of fire
[1:02:11] and so it was a pillar of fire that uh
[1:02:14] filled the upper room and gave birth
[1:02:16] to 120 there and it was a pillar of fire
[1:02:20] then that
[1:02:21] turned and anointed peter as he gave to
[1:02:24] him the keys of
[1:02:26] the kingdom of salvation to the church
[1:02:29] would be the pillar of fire that gave
[1:02:31] faith to peter and john that the
[1:02:34] gate called beautiful and who said to
[1:02:36] the lame beggar
[1:02:38] look on us and it was that same pillar
[1:02:41] of fire that
[1:02:42] appeared in the jail cell and and an
[1:02:45] angel walked out of it and smoked peter
[1:02:48] on the side and loosed him from his
[1:02:50] chains
[1:02:51] it was the angel of god that appeared in
[1:02:54] the new testament church to
[1:02:56] a man by the name of cornelius and he
[1:02:59] described the angel
[1:03:00] as a man who stood before me in bright
[1:03:03] clothing
[1:03:04] and said cornelius and he said what is
[1:03:07] it lord he said thy prayers and nine
[1:03:09] alums are
[1:03:10] come up as a memorial before god god
[1:03:13] never forgets any righteous act
[1:03:16] and he said now send men to japan call
[1:03:18] for one
[1:03:20] simon whose surname is peter he lodges
[1:03:23] with
[1:03:23] one simon a tanner whose house is by the
[1:03:26] seaside and
[1:03:27] he shall tell you what you ought to do
[1:03:30] so to be a book of acts church we have
[1:03:33] to be a
[1:03:34] church that is left by the pillar of
[1:03:36] fire
[1:03:37] and filled with it you see the light of
[1:03:40] the holy ghost within you makes it easy
[1:03:43] for you to believe to have faith to
[1:03:46] claim god's promises
[1:03:48] and the angel of the covenant brother
[1:03:50] branham said you who have received the
[1:03:52] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:53] has got a witness that jesus christ
[1:03:56] lives and reigns and
[1:03:57] it ought to be an easy thing for you to
[1:03:59] believe in divine healing
[1:04:02] amen so again you know we we find this
[1:04:06] all throughout the bible and to be
[1:04:09] a bible church to be a new testament
[1:04:11] church
[1:04:12] we have to be a church that is led by
[1:04:14] the pillar of fire
[1:04:16] by the angel of the covenant in exodus
[1:04:19] chapter 40 and verse 36
[1:04:22] we see it gives specific details about
[1:04:25] how that this this pillar of fire would
[1:04:29] be
[1:04:29] a light by night in a cloud by day
[1:04:32] and the bible said that when the cloud
[1:04:35] was taken
[1:04:35] up from over the tabernacle the children
[1:04:38] of israel went onward
[1:04:40] in all their journeys but if the cloud
[1:04:42] were not taken up
[1:04:44] then they journeyed not until the day
[1:04:47] that it was taken up for the cloud of
[1:04:50] the lord was upon the tabernacle by day
[1:04:52] and
[1:04:52] fire was on it by night in the sight of
[1:04:55] all the house of israel
[1:04:57] throughout all their journeys i don't
[1:04:59] think god's a respecter of persons
[1:05:02] i believe that if god is leading the
[1:05:04] church today
[1:05:06] he's just as interested in us as he was
[1:05:08] then
[1:05:09] amen and it ought to be even more
[1:05:11] powerful under the new covenant than it
[1:05:13] was under the old covenant
[1:05:15] there they were to follow that pillar of
[1:05:18] fire this was their instructions
[1:05:20] the pillar of fire would lead them no
[1:05:22] matter which way it went
[1:05:24] they were to be ready to go when it went
[1:05:28] and and the the but if we notice now
[1:05:32] that and i want to just quote this here
[1:05:34] is that the angel of the lord was going
[1:05:37] before them a pillar of fire
[1:05:39] by night a cloud by day the angel of the
[1:05:42] covenant
[1:05:42] the christ the logos before it was made
[1:05:45] flesh to dwell among us
[1:05:47] and that was a sign of the old testament
[1:05:50] they followed that pillar of fire
[1:05:51] wherever it went they went
[1:05:53] when it stopped they stopped when they
[1:05:55] built their camps
[1:05:56] under the pillar of fire and the priests
[1:06:00] watched foreign they sounded the trumpet
[1:06:03] and it was if it was midnight or three
[1:06:05] o'clock in the morning or 12 o'clock
[1:06:07] noon they all packed up
[1:06:09] and away they went they followed the
[1:06:12] pillar of fire
[1:06:13] and they kept in the will of the lord by
[1:06:16] doing so oh
[1:06:18] you know this has been the failure down
[1:06:20] through the seven ages
[1:06:22] they would see the pillar of fire and
[1:06:25] they would see it move and then they
[1:06:26] would make a camp there
[1:06:28] and then didn't move as it moved
[1:06:32] but you see there were the dark ages
[1:06:34] sometimes were
[1:06:35] they didn't even see the pillar of fire
[1:06:38] didn't even
[1:06:38] see it at all they wasn't led by it they
[1:06:40] wouldn't acquaint it with it
[1:06:42] but there was a fellow one day by the
[1:06:44] name of martin luther
[1:06:46] that he saw the pillar of fire and he
[1:06:48] went on the first
[1:06:50] reformation and he preached the just
[1:06:53] or the righteous shall live by faith and
[1:06:56] that
[1:06:57] fire of emboldened him to resist
[1:07:00] the unbelief of the age and to resist
[1:07:04] the catholic church and he nailed his
[1:07:06] 95th thesis to the door of the church
[1:07:09] and said salvation is by faith alone
[1:07:13] and then he said he taught the bible is
[1:07:16] the only
[1:07:17] authority and the priesthood that the
[1:07:20] priesthood is a
[1:07:22] priesthood forever believer amen that
[1:07:25] every believer
[1:07:26] is a priest unto god this is what the
[1:07:29] pillar of fire
[1:07:30] taught luther and he moved out of that
[1:07:33] but
[1:07:34] and there he began to to operate
[1:07:37] under the leadership of the pillar of
[1:07:39] fire the just shall live by faith
[1:07:42] he was inspired by it he was anointed by
[1:07:45] it
[1:07:45] he was sent out by it but it wasn't long
[1:07:48] until his followers would organize his
[1:07:51] church so tight until you could hardly
[1:07:53] tell them from
[1:07:54] the catholics and soon you had to be a
[1:07:56] lutheran or you were nothing
[1:07:58] and that's brother adams who commented
[1:08:00] about that he said the pillar of fire
[1:08:03] won't hang over nothing like that so
[1:08:05] away it went
[1:08:07] and he said and the pillar of fire moved
[1:08:09] away from the lutheran church
[1:08:11] luther couldn't go because he had all
[1:08:13] his rituals and
[1:08:14] everything that he wrote up and there
[1:08:17] was a little fellow by the name of john
[1:08:19] wesley
[1:08:19] in england that saw it and the way he
[1:08:22] went
[1:08:23] and he had a revival that saved england
[1:08:26] in the united states and
[1:08:27] and the english known world in that day
[1:08:31] under the wesley revival wesley and
[1:08:34] george whitfield and
[1:08:36] asbury and many of them had that great
[1:08:38] revival
[1:08:39] and their revival inspired new songs
[1:08:43] as a song sung the songs of their
[1:08:47] deliverance let me let me just take you
[1:08:50] back for a moment let's just
[1:08:52] go back into the the year 1880
[1:08:56] 140 years ago sister atlanta shared a
[1:08:59] link to this article and some of you may
[1:09:01] have read it but i want to share
[1:09:02] some of it this morning uh it was in
[1:09:05] august
[1:09:06] of 1880 that buddy robinson would be
[1:09:10] at one of those revival meetings now
[1:09:13] if you remember in our family camp that
[1:09:16] we had right over here in the edge of
[1:09:17] texas they had a big marble on the stone
[1:09:21] there that
[1:09:21] listed all the great speakers of the
[1:09:23] past
[1:09:24] and they reminisced some of them
[1:09:27] reminisce to
[1:09:28] to us we used to have meetings like
[1:09:31] you're having
[1:09:32] we used to see the holy spirit move on
[1:09:35] people
[1:09:36] like you see it moved and it made you
[1:09:39] wonder
[1:09:39] what did they used to have because
[1:09:43] today the methodist church is a far cry
[1:09:46] from what that that they they must have
[1:09:49] been back there they're far cry from any
[1:09:51] kind of meetings like we got
[1:09:53] where you shout and praise god and sing
[1:09:55] the songs of zion
[1:09:57] there's a heartfelt religion a man that
[1:10:01] lied that changes
[1:10:02] lives amen where the holy spirit can
[1:10:05] move
[1:10:06] but buddy robinson would be at that one
[1:10:08] of those meetings that revival
[1:10:09] was held somewhere near dallas texas
[1:10:12] where a rich
[1:10:13] ranch man had been converted and allowed
[1:10:16] them to meet on his place
[1:10:18] the word of the revival meetings had
[1:10:20] spread by circuit rider preachers
[1:10:23] and people came in from covered wagons
[1:10:26] from miles around and the ranch owner
[1:10:29] had told them just
[1:10:30] kill as many of his fat cattle to
[1:10:32] provide food for them daily and
[1:10:34] and perhaps as many as 300 people
[1:10:38] had gathered and put up a brush arbor
[1:10:41] as a shelter to worship under and buddy
[1:10:45] he these are from his words he said deep
[1:10:48] conviction
[1:10:49] had settled on me on the second day
[1:10:52] he said i felt that i was lost
[1:10:55] you know it's amazing that people can
[1:10:57] come to a church today
[1:10:59] and never realize they need jesus
[1:11:03] never a spirit of conviction that
[1:11:06] that tells them they have need of god
[1:11:09] it may never be an evening like
[1:11:12] tabernacle
[1:11:13] that there's not a holy spirit moving
[1:11:16] among us
[1:11:17] that deals with the hearts of men and
[1:11:18] women that tells them you need jesus
[1:11:22] amen in fact no matter i don't care who
[1:11:25] you are how great a saint you are you
[1:11:27] need him
[1:11:28] we everyone need that fresh and
[1:11:30] up-to-date experience with god
[1:11:34] and that's why we ought to come for
[1:11:35] every service
[1:11:37] one day he said to preachers i asked the
[1:11:40] workers to go down in the crowd and find
[1:11:42] the center
[1:11:43] and pray for him wherever they found him
[1:11:46] and he said a beautiful old mother with
[1:11:48] her
[1:11:48] beautiful white hair and the finest face
[1:11:50] i ever saw
[1:11:51] came through the crowd and she looked
[1:11:54] like you could
[1:11:55] take a a rag and wipe heaven off of her
[1:11:58] face
[1:11:58] and she fell she found me on the back
[1:12:01] mansion
[1:12:02] there was no need of her saying young
[1:12:04] man are you a sinner
[1:12:05] she looked at me and no no christian
[1:12:08] ever looked like i did
[1:12:09] she went down before me on her knees and
[1:12:12] put her hands up on my bare knees where
[1:12:14] they were sticking through my dirty
[1:12:16] overalls
[1:12:17] and prayed for me as loud as she could
[1:12:20] and the devil got up and said if you
[1:12:22] don't give her a cousin she'll never
[1:12:23] quit
[1:12:25] but it seemed the lord said don't you
[1:12:27] cuss this woman she's praying for your
[1:12:29] lost soul
[1:12:30] then it's then then it seemed to me that
[1:12:32] the devil said
[1:12:33] if you don't get up and run they're
[1:12:35] going to get you but beloved god had
[1:12:37] come on the scene
[1:12:38] i tried to get up but i couldn't get up
[1:12:40] off that
[1:12:42] it seemed that i was glued to it while
[1:12:44] the devil
[1:12:45] fairly hissed in my face and that
[1:12:48] beautiful mother prayed louder and
[1:12:50] louder and finally began to shout
[1:12:52] and rising to her knees began to beat me
[1:12:54] on the head
[1:12:55] until i thought i was going to sink to
[1:12:57] the ground into the pit
[1:12:59] and that old mother shouted as long as
[1:13:01] she wanted to
[1:13:02] and finally arose and looked like she
[1:13:04] was half glorified
[1:13:06] she went back toward the platform in the
[1:13:08] mourner's bench
[1:13:09] but she did not say when she left young
[1:13:11] man come to the altar tonight
[1:13:13] no beloved she didn't ask me to come to
[1:13:15] that altar
[1:13:16] that woman was acquainted with god and
[1:13:18] knew i was coming to the mourner's beach
[1:13:22] when the service was over i finally
[1:13:24] pulled
[1:13:25] loose from that and rose but the
[1:13:28] arrow of conviction
[1:13:29] had already went through my poor heart
[1:13:31] until i couldn't pull it out
[1:13:33] in my agony i walked the grounds that
[1:13:36] afternoon too sick to eat my dinner
[1:13:38] i wish for the sun to go down i thought
[1:13:41] if the sun would go down it would get
[1:13:43] dark and no one could see how mean i was
[1:13:46] and when the sun went down my upper
[1:13:48] heart was not only dark
[1:13:50] on the outside but it was black on the
[1:13:52] inside
[1:13:53] and then i felt i would be a dead man
[1:13:55] before daylight but praise the lord they
[1:13:57] lit up the old torchlights of the ground
[1:14:00] and the congregation began to sing oh
[1:14:03] who will come and go with me
[1:14:06] i'm bound for the promised land said
[1:14:08] i've marched to that little campground
[1:14:11] and i've taken a back seat and i noticed
[1:14:14] a little redhead girl that i'd met
[1:14:15] somewhere on the dance floor
[1:14:17] and the devil always goes to the meeting
[1:14:20] and he said he came to me and said if
[1:14:22] you get up
[1:14:24] a courtship with that little girl on the
[1:14:25] back bench you'll get easy
[1:14:28] but beloved a courtship never eases a
[1:14:30] guilty conscience
[1:14:32] and a lost soul and while i tried to
[1:14:34] talk to her
[1:14:35] i felt like a lost man the preacher who
[1:14:38] preached that night was a tall man with
[1:14:40] with a long beard and and the hair and a
[1:14:43] little inclined the baldness and
[1:14:45] wore a long coat and that's the one that
[1:14:48] preached up to that night but the man
[1:14:49] who preached
[1:14:50] that night he said did not feel the bill
[1:14:53] as far as i was concerned
[1:14:54] he wore a very short coat his beard was
[1:14:57] short
[1:14:57] his hair stood straight up on his head
[1:15:00] he looked dangerous
[1:15:03] and i thought he can't preach a leak and
[1:15:06] would be a failure but later i learned
[1:15:08] he was one of the greatest preachers
[1:15:09] west of the
[1:15:10] mississippi river he preached to the
[1:15:12] lost world
[1:15:14] without a savior where the devil was
[1:15:16] boss
[1:15:17] and general manager and where people
[1:15:19] were under
[1:15:20] the awful dominion of the devil he
[1:15:22] pictured christ
[1:15:24] laying outside his robes of royal
[1:15:26] splendor
[1:15:27] putting on humanity and being born in a
[1:15:30] manger then he pictured christ
[1:15:32] on the cross because he loved the lost
[1:15:34] and dying world
[1:15:35] he made the crucifixion of christ so
[1:15:38] real that it seemed to me he had
[1:15:40] he had died a week ago somewhere here in
[1:15:42] texas
[1:15:43] and when he made his altar call the
[1:15:45] response was so general that
[1:15:47] to all appearance the whole crowd would
[1:15:48] finally land at the altar
[1:15:50] they went whooping and yelling screaming
[1:15:53] and praying as
[1:15:54] loud as they could two or three
[1:15:56] preachers were helping men to the altar
[1:15:58] there were
[1:15:58] so many they turned the benches around
[1:16:00] to make a big pen
[1:16:02] and they actually filled it full and i
[1:16:04] stood back and wept i wanted to go the
[1:16:06] altar but i knew
[1:16:07] nothing of church preachers meetings of
[1:16:10] salvation
[1:16:11] i didn't know how to start or what to do
[1:16:13] but thank god he will always help a boy
[1:16:15] that wants to do right
[1:16:17] an old preacher with a lost long white
[1:16:20] beard and beautiful white locks
[1:16:22] came down the aisle and said is there a
[1:16:24] young man back here
[1:16:26] that wants to meet me in heaven and he
[1:16:28] said if so come give me your hand and
[1:16:30] i'll pray that god may save you
[1:16:32] i stood and i wept and one moment i said
[1:16:36] if jesus loved me well enough to die for
[1:16:38] me
[1:16:39] i will love him well enough to fight for
[1:16:41] him
[1:16:42] while in the next breath i said i will
[1:16:44] shoot the next man
[1:16:46] that talks about jesus christ my gun
[1:16:49] which was loaded was in my pocket
[1:16:51] the old preacher pleaded and i started
[1:16:53] saying i can do that much i can at least
[1:16:55] give him my hand when i reached
[1:16:57] him i was crying as loud as i could he
[1:17:00] grabbed my hand he missed it he took me
[1:17:02] by the arm he gave it a shake
[1:17:04] and when he turned me loose i started
[1:17:06] down the aisle
[1:17:07] toward the mourner's bench i didn't go
[1:17:10] very far until the devil stood before me
[1:17:12] and said
[1:17:12] if you go to that mourner's bench the
[1:17:14] preacher will see your old ragged
[1:17:16] your old ragged breeches and make fun of
[1:17:19] you well he couldn't stop me with that
[1:17:21] and he said well they'll see your old
[1:17:22] pistol
[1:17:23] and that'll get you in trouble but thank
[1:17:25] god he didn't stop me at that but i went
[1:17:27] down
[1:17:28] the eye aisle the old pistol felt as big
[1:17:30] as a mule
[1:17:31] and the old deck of cards in my pocket
[1:17:33] was as big as a bale of cotton
[1:17:35] and i was getting on my right foot i
[1:17:38] thought i was going to get right in the
[1:17:39] pit and i would stagger
[1:17:40] then i'd get on my left foot that day
[1:17:43] deck of cards weighed as much as a bale
[1:17:45] of cotton
[1:17:45] i know today what king david said when
[1:17:48] he said they will reel to and fro and
[1:17:50] will stagger like a drunk man
[1:17:51] and be at their wit's end and when i
[1:17:54] reached the altar somebody said fix a
[1:17:56] seat for this young man
[1:17:58] he's deeply struck thank god that man
[1:18:01] was a philosopher the only mistake he
[1:18:03] made was not that i was able to sit in a
[1:18:06] rocking chair because my head was so
[1:18:08] full
[1:18:09] of gospel bullets that i was just about
[1:18:11] all in
[1:18:12] i fell down on that mourner's bench and
[1:18:14] right
[1:18:15] somebody got me by the hills and
[1:18:17] straight me out
[1:18:18] right there i caught the devil in a lie
[1:18:20] he told me when i started down the aisle
[1:18:22] the people would see my old ragged
[1:18:24] breaches and make fun of me to my glad
[1:18:26] surprise
[1:18:27] every preacher knelt around me as i
[1:18:29] prayed and screamed as
[1:18:30] loud as i could and and for god to have
[1:18:33] mercy on me and save my life soul
[1:18:36] my streaks and whales seem to touch the
[1:18:38] heart of every preacher
[1:18:40] there as it knelt around me with their
[1:18:42] faces
[1:18:43] turned toward heaven and their hands in
[1:18:45] the air
[1:18:46] i never heard men pray like that before
[1:18:49] it was a life
[1:18:50] and death struggle a poor soul was right
[1:18:53] on the borderland
[1:18:54] of death and destruction but god's mercy
[1:18:57] had reached my case and while we were
[1:19:00] praying together the bottom dropped out
[1:19:02] of heaven
[1:19:03] and my soul was flooded with light and
[1:19:05] joy
[1:19:06] until the little waves of glory rolled
[1:19:09] up and down my soul
[1:19:11] i don't know how i got up but bless god
[1:19:13] i know i got up because i'm up now
[1:19:15] and when i did get on my feet people
[1:19:18] look like
[1:19:18] angels they appeared to be rubbed in
[1:19:20] white it was as light as i
[1:19:22] as it as this had been at the noon hour
[1:19:25] of the day but it was at 11 o'clock at
[1:19:27] night
[1:19:28] this was wednesday august 11 1880
[1:19:31] how well i remember that light it'll
[1:19:33] stay with me forever
[1:19:35] no doubt the reader has heard the little
[1:19:37] song
[1:19:38] how well i remember in sorrow's dark
[1:19:40] night when the lamp of his word shed its
[1:19:43] beautiful life
[1:19:44] more grace he hath given and the burdens
[1:19:46] removed and over and over
[1:19:48] his goodness has proved and shall i turn
[1:19:51] back to the world
[1:19:52] oh no not i not i he said i believe that
[1:19:56] getting religion
[1:19:57] is the finest thing in the known world
[1:20:01] after i hopped and skipped and jumped
[1:20:04] and shouted unto midnight
[1:20:05] i would jump the mourner's bench from
[1:20:08] one side to the other
[1:20:09] all the time telling people i had got
[1:20:12] religion
[1:20:14] well thank god i got religion sure
[1:20:16] enough
[1:20:17] and it seemed like religion had got me
[1:20:20] after shouting until about midnight i
[1:20:22] went down to the
[1:20:23] ravine through my revolver way i killed
[1:20:26] a little chunk fire
[1:20:27] and burnt my deck of cards and then i
[1:20:30] crawled under
[1:20:31] an ox wagon lay down on the bare ground
[1:20:34] and place my hat on a chunk for a pillow
[1:20:36] i did not go to sleep where sleep had
[1:20:38] left the country
[1:20:40] i laid there and laughed like a boy at a
[1:20:43] circus
[1:20:44] i was almost tickled to death every
[1:20:46] burden was gone
[1:20:48] my guilt was gone all sorrow and
[1:20:51] sadness was gone i forgot
[1:20:55] that i lived in poverty i thought i was
[1:20:57] dressed like the angels
[1:20:59] and while my heart was turning
[1:21:01] somersault i was laughing like a boy at
[1:21:03] a circus
[1:21:04] i was one boy that kept company with his
[1:21:06] religion the very first night that he
[1:21:08] got it
[1:21:09] i felt that night was as though i would
[1:21:11] never be sick
[1:21:12] sad lonesome hungry or in trouble it
[1:21:15] seemed that heaven
[1:21:16] was only three feet away during that
[1:21:19] night jesus came under the wagon and
[1:21:21] called me to preach
[1:21:23] i could see his beautiful face with a
[1:21:25] crown of thorns on his brow
[1:21:27] i could see the sweat and the blood
[1:21:29] mingled on his face
[1:21:30] and the old purple robe over his
[1:21:32] shoulders he was so real to me
[1:21:34] i'll never forget my first meeting with
[1:21:36] jesus he told me he wanted me to preach
[1:21:38] the gospel while i told him i would go
[1:21:41] i had no idea what that meant to be a
[1:21:43] god-called minister
[1:21:45] or preacher of the gospel but after 47
[1:21:47] years of preaching almost day and night
[1:21:49] living alone in my life sometimes
[1:21:52] spending only a week at home
[1:21:54] during the whole year i've learned that
[1:21:56] when god calls a man to preach god
[1:21:58] really has to do something for him
[1:22:00] the next morning his day was breaking i
[1:22:03] crawled
[1:22:04] out from under the ox wagon i went on to
[1:22:06] the campground
[1:22:07] i watched the sun rise in all its
[1:22:10] grandeur and glory
[1:22:11] the heavens were lit lighted up i would
[1:22:14] look one direction and it would appear
[1:22:16] to be like a
[1:22:17] mountain of oranges in another direction
[1:22:19] like a ton of strawberries
[1:22:21] i'd look at another direction it was
[1:22:23] like a ton of ice cream
[1:22:25] it seemed to me the angels were having
[1:22:27] strawberries and ice cream for breakfast
[1:22:30] i looked and and and and saw
[1:22:33] a big flock of clouds in another
[1:22:36] direction
[1:22:36] and i had the appearance of a great
[1:22:38] flock of sheep with their wool on fire
[1:22:40] and just about the time heaven came down
[1:22:42] on earth and i was so blessed
[1:22:44] that soon i was leaping up and down and
[1:22:47] clapping my hands and praising god as
[1:22:49] loud as i could shout
[1:22:51] about that time a man come along and
[1:22:53] said are you going to go up to the
[1:22:54] testimony meeting this morning
[1:22:56] i said yes sir i'm going up i've never
[1:22:58] been to a testimony meeting
[1:23:00] in fact i've never heard one i walked up
[1:23:02] to the big arbor
[1:23:03] i wonder what kind of a meeting it would
[1:23:05] be if it was
[1:23:07] good as the one we had last night it
[1:23:09] would be great and when we got up to the
[1:23:12] arbor
[1:23:12] if the man took the big ox horn and blew
[1:23:15] it until it sounded like a bugle
[1:23:17] the ox horn instead of they used it
[1:23:19] instead of a bell to call the people the
[1:23:21] tabernacle
[1:23:22] at the sound of the horn the people came
[1:23:25] from every direction
[1:23:26] that came out of their their tents and
[1:23:28] wagons
[1:23:29] until there were people all over the
[1:23:31] campground and and
[1:23:33] all over the camp shed and the and a man
[1:23:35] read a few verses of scripture
[1:23:37] and they sang and they prayed and after
[1:23:39] the meeting that the meeting was open
[1:23:41] for testimonies
[1:23:43] i wondered what in the world was it
[1:23:44] going to be like a man rose and began to
[1:23:47] praise god testify
[1:23:48] of the saving grace while he testified
[1:23:51] my heart was leaping for joy but when
[1:23:54] another
[1:23:54] went but when he sat down another man
[1:23:57] beat me up
[1:23:58] and and he said a big tall man with a
[1:24:00] black beard
[1:24:01] and long black hair with a big woolen
[1:24:04] shirt and overalls and high-heeled boots
[1:24:06] stood in the presence of that crowd his
[1:24:09] frame trembling said oh brother
[1:24:11] i've been all over these prairies for 20
[1:24:14] years as a ranch man
[1:24:15] and i have committed all the sins known
[1:24:18] to a ranch man
[1:24:19] when i've heard of this medium last
[1:24:21] night about dark it made me mad
[1:24:24] i sat on my horse and rode in last night
[1:24:26] i came here to whip
[1:24:27] every preacher on the grounds and run
[1:24:29] everybody off but when i arrived here
[1:24:31] last night
[1:24:32] at a late hour i beheld one of the
[1:24:34] strangest sights of my life
[1:24:37] there would be a crowd over on one side
[1:24:39] singing
[1:24:40] and a crowd on another side shouting
[1:24:43] their hands were
[1:24:44] up their hair was hanging down their
[1:24:46] backs their faces looked like angels
[1:24:48] and over in another place it'd be a
[1:24:50] crowd down on their knees praying
[1:24:52] and somebody would raise up then and
[1:24:54] start shouting and i thought well
[1:24:56] i won't whip anybody until they quit and
[1:24:59] quiet down
[1:25:00] but instead of shopping stopping they
[1:25:02] became worse
[1:25:04] finally just to see what they were doing
[1:25:05] i made my way to the crowd to bench
[1:25:08] right in the middle of the arbor where i
[1:25:09] could see everything that was going on
[1:25:12] the great multitude seemingly did not
[1:25:14] know i was there but while they prayed
[1:25:16] and sang and shouted
[1:25:17] my whole life stood before me i saw i
[1:25:20] was a lost man
[1:25:22] i knew that if i would die i would go to
[1:25:24] hell the burden became
[1:25:26] so awful that i fell off the bench i got
[1:25:29] down between two benches where two or
[1:25:31] three men gathered around me
[1:25:32] and they began to sing and pray with me
[1:25:34] and form me and this morning just before
[1:25:37] day
[1:25:37] god save my soul and he said
[1:25:41] but he said i couldn't stand it no
[1:25:43] longer i had to do
[1:25:45] something or die or simply just blow up
[1:25:48] and i jumped just as high as i could i
[1:25:51] screamed as loud as i could
[1:25:54] and i began to jump up and down as fast
[1:25:56] as i could
[1:25:57] it looked like i would die with
[1:25:59] religious satisfaction
[1:26:02] amen this was a methodist meeting and
[1:26:05] the lord
[1:26:06] came to my relief and showed me a big
[1:26:08] post
[1:26:09] under the old arbor and i threw both
[1:26:12] arms around that post and started up
[1:26:14] just like a gray squirrel
[1:26:15] and i climbed until i got my head got
[1:26:19] to the brush and i could go no further
[1:26:21] and while i was sticking there on the
[1:26:23] side of the post
[1:26:24] god poured out a spirit on the people i
[1:26:26] believe the holy spirit fulfilled that
[1:26:28] multitude of
[1:26:30] 150 to 300 people they were filled with
[1:26:32] the holy ghost like they were on the day
[1:26:34] of pentecost
[1:26:35] there were hundreds of people leaping in
[1:26:37] the air clapping their hands
[1:26:39] praising god at the top of the voice the
[1:26:42] women
[1:26:42] literally danced and shouted like they
[1:26:45] were angels
[1:26:46] men ran into others arms and wrestles
[1:26:48] like athletes
[1:26:50] waves of glory swept over them and it
[1:26:52] took life looked like
[1:26:54] they were immense in glory
[1:26:58] that was the methodist church
[1:27:01] back then how far
[1:27:05] they have fallen from grace
[1:27:09] you see the pillow fire was there they
[1:27:12] were reacting
[1:27:14] amen to the very power of god that was
[1:27:17] in their midst
[1:27:19] amen this did not just produce emotion
[1:27:22] just
[1:27:22] changed their lives it made a preacher
[1:27:25] out of
[1:27:26] out of a card playing dancing bloody
[1:27:28] robinson
[1:27:29] and made a son of god out of him when he
[1:27:32] traveled around the country
[1:27:34] and been preaching the gospel for years
[1:27:36] and years and years
[1:27:38] because he met god in a pillar of fire
[1:27:43] amen but you know the first thing you
[1:27:45] know methodists got so organized
[1:27:47] until after a few rounds they got just
[1:27:49] as cold
[1:27:51] and starchy as they could be you see the
[1:27:54] pillar of fire and i'm quoting brother
[1:27:56] branham here
[1:27:56] he said the pillar of fire will not hang
[1:27:59] over that
[1:28:01] i'll tell you what if you're sitting
[1:28:02] here cold
[1:28:04] and in full and horrible come on and
[1:28:06] starchy
[1:28:07] the pillow fire ain't gonna hang over
[1:28:09] you it's looking for
[1:28:11] somebody that will respond to the word
[1:28:15] amen that believes it's the truth that
[1:28:17] allows you to change our lives
[1:28:20] amen and he said the pillar of fire
[1:28:23] won't hang over that's the way it went
[1:28:25] and he said a bunch of people called the
[1:28:27] pentecostal scene it
[1:28:28] and the way they went after but then
[1:28:30] they built him a church under but the
[1:28:32] sad part
[1:28:32] the pentecostals are so organized that
[1:28:35] the pillar of fire is moving out again
[1:28:37] and they can't go that's right the
[1:28:40] pillar of fire is moving anyhow
[1:28:43] god said it would they had the sign of
[1:28:45] the pillar of fire by night a cloud by
[1:28:47] day
[1:28:48] that led them and he's here in the gods
[1:28:50] house
[1:28:51] where that same pillar of fire is in the
[1:28:53] house right here now
[1:28:54] because it was the angel of the covenant
[1:28:57] the lord
[1:28:58] jesus christ when he died he rose again
[1:29:01] he lives forever more he promised the
[1:29:03] things he did we do also and greater
[1:29:05] for he went to the father amen so i
[1:29:09] wonder why
[1:29:10] today now wait a minute i wonder why the
[1:29:12] pillar of fire isn't hanging over some
[1:29:14] of these
[1:29:15] message morgues today backslidden
[1:29:18] preachers
[1:29:20] men who have long forgot even how to
[1:29:22] pray
[1:29:24] churches that don't even know how to
[1:29:26] pray people through
[1:29:27] to the baptism of the holy ghost maybe
[1:29:30] the real reason is because they never
[1:29:32] got the holy ghost themselves
[1:29:36] they must meet that pillar of fire and
[1:29:39] that
[1:29:39] then be sent by the angel of god the
[1:29:42] holy ghost
[1:29:43] it must be our drive it must be our
[1:29:46] passion
[1:29:47] amen it's a shame when preachers have
[1:29:49] nothing
[1:29:50] to preach are you with me now they have
[1:29:53] nothing to preach but
[1:29:54] to make fun of and ridicule and
[1:29:57] blaspheme
[1:29:58] anointed prayers i heard of one
[1:30:02] ridiculing people who pray with a
[1:30:04] passion
[1:30:05] and you know just recently saying
[1:30:07] brother branham only prayed softly
[1:30:10] and then he made fun saying is god death
[1:30:15] does god need a hearing aid that's
[1:30:18] blasphemy
[1:30:20] to make fun of to mock to ridicule
[1:30:24] amen yeah it's sad when a minister tells
[1:30:27] his church basically
[1:30:28] don't get anointed when you pray there's
[1:30:32] there were many ways brother branham
[1:30:33] prayed we know that he prayed softly but
[1:30:35] he didn't always pray quietly
[1:30:38] hey man he didn't always he didn't
[1:30:39] always lift his voice but many times he
[1:30:41] did and especially
[1:30:43] at the climax of a meeting you don't
[1:30:44] have to listen to too many tapes and
[1:30:46] find that out amen but
[1:30:49] let me just go to the words of jesus
[1:30:51] hebrews five and seven
[1:30:52] in the days of his flesh he offered up
[1:30:55] both prayers and supplication
[1:30:57] with loud crying or strong
[1:31:00] crying and cheers unto him that was able
[1:31:03] to save him from death
[1:31:05] and was heard and that he feared
[1:31:08] so so again this was jesus amen he
[1:31:12] offered up prayers and supplication
[1:31:15] with loud cries
[1:31:18] [Applause]
[1:31:20] and he was heard in that which he feared
[1:31:23] i say if the angels shake the post of
[1:31:26] the temples
[1:31:27] come on now that ought to be good enough
[1:31:29] for you
[1:31:30] good enough for me amen in isaiah
[1:31:33] 6 he said and decried one another and
[1:31:36] said
[1:31:37] holy holy holy is the lord god almighty
[1:31:41] the lord of hosts and the whole earth is
[1:31:43] full of his glory
[1:31:45] and the post out the door moved at the
[1:31:48] voice of him that cried
[1:31:50] and the house was filled with smoke
[1:31:53] amen this wasn't singing in a high pitch
[1:31:56] that broke a
[1:31:57] crystal glass this this was shouting
[1:32:01] crying holy holy
[1:32:04] holy amen that wasn't crying
[1:32:08] holy holy holy
[1:32:13] they wasn't whispered they cried
[1:32:16] until the post of the temple
[1:32:19] moved it ought to be the same way in the
[1:32:23] house of god
[1:32:24] where there is some fervency where
[1:32:27] there's some passion
[1:32:28] where there's a drive in the a if the
[1:32:31] methodist could do that come on
[1:32:33] what about us born again holy ghost
[1:32:36] field
[1:32:37] hoping life amen we got even more than
[1:32:40] sad about that they have
[1:32:43] hallelujah you say but brother tim the
[1:32:46] seals have been open to me and
[1:32:47] the the the revelation and we just sit
[1:32:51] there
[1:32:51] studiously and tried to absorb let me
[1:32:54] tell you
[1:32:54] that's not what they did in heaven when
[1:32:56] it was open
[1:32:57] amen the bible said and i beheld and i
[1:33:00] heard the voice
[1:33:02] of many angels round about the throne
[1:33:05] and beasts and elders and number of them
[1:33:07] was ten thousand times ten thousands and
[1:33:10] thousands of thousands
[1:33:11] saying with a loud voice worthy is the
[1:33:15] lamb that was slain
[1:33:16] to receive power and riches and wilson
[1:33:19] and strength
[1:33:20] and honor and glory and blessing
[1:33:23] and i'll tell you if you've seen the
[1:33:25] seals open
[1:33:27] hallelujah if you saw your name in the
[1:33:29] book
[1:33:31] if you saw the mysteries have revealed
[1:33:34] and you see
[1:33:34] where you are in this last day it'll
[1:33:37] make you sound too
[1:33:38] it'll make you rejoice also
[1:33:45] hallelujah amen why even the souls
[1:33:50] under the altar prayed with a passion
[1:33:51] and a loud voice
[1:33:53] they were so located to the throne that
[1:33:55] they could hear the answer coming back
[1:33:58] and the bible said and they cried out
[1:34:00] with a loud voice saying
[1:34:01] how long o lord holy and true will you
[1:34:04] refrain from
[1:34:05] judging and avenging our blood on those
[1:34:07] that dwell on the earth
[1:34:08] you see there there you see how we get
[1:34:12] we we that got to the place we're so
[1:34:14] formal
[1:34:16] we we we don't want we don't want any
[1:34:19] shouting we don't want any rejoicing
[1:34:22] we we don't want any any kind of uh
[1:34:25] emotion you know the people shouldn't
[1:34:26] get emotional today
[1:34:28] you know and brother timothy just
[1:34:31] recently preached on the dangers of
[1:34:33] formalism and
[1:34:34] and another pastor can you imagine these
[1:34:37] pastors
[1:34:38] had backslidness can be had the right of
[1:34:41] blood defending his formalism
[1:34:43] because his church is dead and as dry
[1:34:47] as last year's burden now i want to say
[1:34:50] why defend your formalism just repent
[1:34:54] yes
[1:34:54] [Applause]
[1:34:57] amen let me say it this way if you're
[1:34:59] not on fire
[1:35:01] if there's no passion if there's no
[1:35:03] drive
[1:35:04] if there's no joy flowing like a river
[1:35:07] you're formal and your wells are stopped
[1:35:10] up
[1:35:11] it's time to unstop let the blessings
[1:35:15] flow
[1:35:16] let the joy come out
[1:35:17] [Applause]
[1:35:20] amen well this is not all an emotion
[1:35:23] brother tim
[1:35:24] that may be right but god hates an
[1:35:26] emotionless religion
[1:35:29] amen in end time evangelism brother adam
[1:35:32] said and
[1:35:33] and he said these scientific theory of
[1:35:35] the modern so-called religious groups
[1:35:37] have tried to prove that this blessed
[1:35:39] thing that we have
[1:35:40] called the holy spirit is only emotion
[1:35:43] it just don't stand up to theirs
[1:35:45] according to scientific theory well i
[1:35:48] just like to ask them this
[1:35:49] what makes them change
[1:35:53] what makes the drunkard stop drinking
[1:35:56] what makes the prostitute cease her evil
[1:35:59] life
[1:36:00] what makes the cancer and the diseases
[1:36:03] depart from the people
[1:36:04] and the deaf and the dumb and the blind
[1:36:07] and the dead
[1:36:08] to raise up explain that if there is
[1:36:11] that emotion
[1:36:12] it has emotion with it certainly
[1:36:15] anything that's alive has emotion
[1:36:18] and anything that don't have emotion is
[1:36:20] dead excuse
[1:36:21] expression but i think we ought to bury
[1:36:23] some of this emotionless religion
[1:36:26] amen because it's dead it has no emotion
[1:36:29] and any religion
[1:36:30] that has no emotion and it should be
[1:36:32] buried uh
[1:36:33] because it is emotional
[1:36:38] amen jesus when he entered the city and
[1:36:40] the
[1:36:41] and the children of them uh all his
[1:36:43] friends crying hosanna
[1:36:45] to him to him that cometh in the name of
[1:36:46] the lord those religions so that they
[1:36:49] couldn't stand it it was too emotional
[1:36:52] said if they hold their peace the rocks
[1:36:55] will immediately cry out
[1:36:56] something must cry out because life is
[1:37:00] there
[1:37:03] hallelujah well brother tim but you know
[1:37:06] we're
[1:37:06] we're we're balanced you know we we're
[1:37:08] we're not really over here
[1:37:10] fervent and on fire like that and we're
[1:37:13] really
[1:37:14] and we're really not real cold you know
[1:37:16] we get an amen once in a while and
[1:37:18] you know somebody you know has a
[1:37:21] inspired song and we raise their hand
[1:37:24] so we're balanced brother tim no that's
[1:37:27] called lukewarm
[1:37:31] mm-hmm amen listen brother branham said
[1:37:36] listen what he said we're now seated
[1:37:38] together
[1:37:39] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:37:43] sitting in there a great seat that's
[1:37:45] already fired up been raised from the
[1:37:46] dead
[1:37:47] we're a part of it if you're part of
[1:37:49] that bride you are because the bride's a
[1:37:50] part of the groom you know
[1:37:52] and so we find out the same thing she'll
[1:37:54] do exactly what's predicted for her to
[1:37:56] do
[1:37:57] in this day she won't be allowed to see
[1:37:59] her
[1:38:00] not by no means a lukewarm
[1:38:03] she'll be on fire for god she'll be
[1:38:06] moving
[1:38:07] in the spirit hallelujah
[1:38:11] amen now here's what he said about your
[1:38:15] formalism
[1:38:18] he said now this is door-to-door door of
[1:38:21] the door in 57
[1:38:23] he said now that certainly fits the
[1:38:25] situation today
[1:38:26] of the modern church the pentecostal
[1:38:29] church today just lukewarm condition
[1:38:32] neither cold nor hot it would be
[1:38:35] better if we would either be back
[1:38:39] in their old denominational state status
[1:38:43] or be up in the realms of the blessings
[1:38:45] of god
[1:38:46] than to sit in a lukewarm condition
[1:38:50] as we are now the lord would appreciate
[1:38:53] us
[1:38:53] much more if we would do it
[1:39:00] god would rather you either be cold
[1:39:03] not in between
[1:39:08] not in between come on cold or hot
[1:39:12] that's what god wants amen he said he
[1:39:15] god would appreciate you even more just
[1:39:17] going on back to your old denominational
[1:39:19] state or status
[1:39:21] or be up here he said in the realms of
[1:39:23] the blessing of god then just
[1:39:25] in a lukewarm condition i say god don't
[1:39:28] let me be lukewarm whatever
[1:39:31] amen and i don't want to be cold either
[1:39:33] amen let me be
[1:39:34] on fire amen let the fire of god burn
[1:39:38] hot within the soul man

[2:04:02] and israel saw the egyptians dead
[2:04:05] upon the seashore and israel saw the
[2:04:08] great work
[2:04:09] which the lord did to the egyptians the
[2:04:12] people feared the lord and believed
[2:04:14] the lord and his servant moses
[2:04:17] now brother branham teaches us that this
[2:04:20] is a type
[2:04:21] of the blood sanctifying the
[2:04:24] power of god killing sin nature
[2:04:28] sin behind you the taskmasters the
[2:04:31] cigarettes the whiskey
[2:04:32] the road houses the picture shows
[2:04:35] everything that bothered you back there
[2:04:37] and hindered you in your christian
[2:04:38] experience died
[2:04:40] in the blood of jesus that's what buddy
[2:04:43] robinson found
[2:04:44] he didn't need the pistol anymore he had
[2:04:47] the lord as a guard
[2:04:48] and protector threw it over and around
[2:04:51] come on hey man he didn't need a deck of
[2:04:53] cards anymore
[2:04:55] that old thing that weighed like a bale
[2:04:57] of cotton burned with fire
[2:04:59] amen why he had went through the blood
[2:05:02] of jesus christ
[2:05:04] amen the red blood of jesus christ
[2:05:06] drowned every cigarette
[2:05:08] every tobacco and when the filth of the
[2:05:11] world was
[2:05:12] drowned like them past massacres right
[2:05:14] there and they were floating in the sea

[2:05:41] it'll paint it make joy unspeakable and
[2:05:43] full of glory
[2:05:45] that's what he'll do
[2:05:49] amen as i said the devil get our kids
[2:05:52] to look at porn then condemn until they
[2:05:54] hate themselves
[2:05:56] they'll feel so dirty they'll cut
[2:05:58] themselves and want to commit suicide
[2:06:00] he's a wicked and a hard taskmaster
[2:06:03] amen but i'll tell you what moses did
[2:06:06] moses got on the other side
[2:06:08] and he began to sing in the spirit
[2:06:11] he raised his hand to god and sang in
[2:06:13] the spirit and marry him
[2:06:15] got a tambourine and began to dance and
[2:06:17] shout and jump up and down and praise
[2:06:19] god
[2:06:20] hallelujah amen and all the taskmasters
[2:06:24] they looked and saw

[2:07:20] another day
[2:07:21] my enemy is dead and when you can see
[2:07:25] he's dead

[2:07:28] no more power over your life

[2:07:34] make you

[2:07:38] buddy robinson they're south the glories
[2:07:41] of god
[2:07:42] amen amen look moses was
[2:07:46] a type of this and he could see what the
[2:07:48] what had been done
[2:07:50] now now brother branham talked about
[2:07:52] this and he said
[2:07:53] this was pentecost he said this was
[2:07:56] a pentecostal experience they were the
[2:08:00] chosen people of god they had the spirit
[2:08:02] among them
[2:08:03] and he said when when moses had
[2:08:07] across the red sea and found behind him
[2:08:09] the red sea
[2:08:10] of the blood representing the blood and
[2:08:12] all the task
[2:08:13] masters he ever beat him and all the
[2:08:16] children of israel
[2:08:17] he raised his hand and sang in the
[2:08:19] spirit oh
[2:08:20] every one of us can be of moses
[2:08:23] hallelujah said every one of us can be
[2:08:26] of moses
[2:08:27] when we look back in the red blood of
[2:08:30] the lord jesus
[2:08:31] as he ever drunk every old bottle
[2:08:35] old vulgar woman or every old dirty man
[2:08:39] or oh every old dirty thing we've ever
[2:08:40] done in our life all dead
[2:08:42] in the blood of the lord jesus it'll
[2:08:44] make you sing in the spirit
[2:08:47] hallelujah cigarettes tobaccos bad habit
[2:08:50] everything gone
[2:08:51] and dead in the blood of the lord jesus
[2:08:53] and then we can raise our hands and sing
[2:08:55] in the spirit
[2:08:57] amen brother brandon said that was real
[2:08:59] pentecost
[2:09:01] now you want to talk about being a book
[2:09:02] of acts church start there
[2:09:06] hallelujah oh you lukewarm message
[2:09:09] believers today you've come out of egypt
[2:09:12] but why is it that that taskmaster still
[2:09:15] owns you
[2:09:17] come you can't keep out of porn
[2:09:21] keep your head out of movies still go
[2:09:24] into picture shows or worse than that
[2:09:26] have it in your house
[2:09:28] why is it your wives and daughters are
[2:09:30] still slave to makeup
[2:09:34] you know how come you still have that
[2:09:36] uncontrollable temper
[2:09:39] why is it your marriages are not
[2:09:40] sanctified
[2:09:42] and there is verbal and mental and
[2:09:44] physical abuse
[2:09:46] how come this how come is it your kids
[2:09:49] don't want your religion
[2:09:52] how come there's no love in your home
[2:09:55] why is it your heart is so hard you
[2:09:57] can't tell your wife and your kids
[2:09:59] that you love them and show it you know
[2:10:02] even the father said of jesus
[2:10:04] this is a son i love this is my
[2:10:07] beloved son and when the spirit of
[2:10:10] christ comes into the light
[2:10:11] it'll make you love everybody that's
[2:10:13] what buddy robinson was trying to say
[2:10:16] he saw us that everything looked
[2:10:17] different and men that women look like
[2:10:20] angels the heavens were on fire with the
[2:10:22] glory of god
[2:10:23] i began to shout because he now looked
[2:10:26] through a sanctified
[2:10:28] eye
[2:10:31] why is it you look for fault in the
[2:10:32] church
[2:10:34] is it just to justify your own meanness
[2:10:37] and your own sins i mean why is it if
[2:10:40] you go home and tell your kids
[2:10:42] wow they're just working up these people
[2:10:44] you know you don't have to shout and
[2:10:46] scream and jump like that and
[2:10:48] you know the baptist way of getting it
[2:10:49] is a lot better
[2:10:51] you know just accept the message say i
[2:10:53] believe it and you got the holy ghost
[2:10:56] well that ain't the way that god's
[2:10:58] prophet described the new birth
[2:11:00] he didn't believe in a new birth that
[2:11:02] was a dry eyed confession
[2:11:04] he believed he did not believe in easy
[2:11:06] believism
[2:11:08] the billy graham altar calls were not
[2:11:10] william branham's way of doing
[2:11:12] amen he taught that the new birth was a
[2:11:14] mess
[2:11:16] yes amen he said this in the deceit
[2:11:20] church by the world
[2:11:22] now we know all about that birth i don't
[2:11:24] care where it is
[2:11:25] or whereabouts it's a mess if it's a
[2:11:28] baby born on a ship
[2:11:29] pile on a hard floor or a pink decorated
[2:11:32] hospital room
[2:11:33] it's a mess anyhow a birth of a cat a
[2:11:36] birth of anything else is a mess
[2:11:38] and the new birth is nothing less than a
[2:11:41] mess
[2:11:42] but people are so starchy well we'll go
[2:11:44] over there where they shake hands
[2:11:46] we'll go where they don't bawl and cry
[2:11:48] and beat on the altar and cry out
[2:11:50] we want to be too human what we need is
[2:11:54] a birth
[2:11:55] a dine out to bring forth life
[2:11:58] amen an old seed i know potato seed
[2:12:01] potato you take that potato put it in
[2:12:03] the ground
[2:12:04] until you can have new potatoes that old
[2:12:06] potato has to rot
[2:12:08] a corn cannot produce a new life until
[2:12:10] it's rotten
[2:12:11] and a man or woman will never have a new
[2:12:13] birth until their intellectuals
[2:12:15] and their own self is dead die out in
[2:12:18] the altar and scream
[2:12:20] and get all messed up to the place the
[2:12:22] starks gets out of your collar
[2:12:24] and you've been born again by the spirit
[2:12:25] of god i don't care
[2:12:27] if you squall speak in tongues jump up
[2:12:30] and down
[2:12:31] flop like a chicken with his head off
[2:12:33] you're bringing forth new lives
[2:12:35] but we substituted something for it we
[2:12:37] wanted the classical way
[2:12:38] [Music]
[2:12:40] oh brother tim but that was before the
[2:12:43] seals
[2:12:45] and now you don't want me quoting what
[2:12:48] he said after the zeal deal
[2:12:50] by the way he used the same illustration
[2:12:52] all the way in 1965 and broken sisters
[2:12:56] but what about 1965 what what about
[2:12:59] when i was a little boy when i sat in
[2:13:02] like tabernacle
[2:13:04] you know i looked out at these new
[2:13:06] handrails that we got put up over here
[2:13:09] at our pavilion there going up those
[2:13:11] little steps
[2:13:12] and i thought about the kids and you
[2:13:15] know how we had to make them sturdy
[2:13:17] because little kids would get up and
[2:13:19] slide up and down on them
[2:13:21] you know we couldn't make them wobbly
[2:13:23] you know some of us
[2:13:25] our steps ain't quite as surprised they
[2:13:27] used to be and we need something
[2:13:29] steady to walk on and so i i
[2:13:33] i thought about brother james mitchell
[2:13:35] brother daryl and
[2:13:36] and and all the brothers all all of them
[2:13:40] wonder some of some of the best people
[2:13:42] in the world
[2:13:43] and they they they didn't just make a
[2:13:45] highway job they
[2:13:46] i mean they made it match everything on
[2:13:48] the building
[2:13:49] everything beautiful job but i thought
[2:13:51] about that i said i remember being a
[2:13:53] live tabernacle myself
[2:13:55] and this little boy sliding down those
[2:13:58] arm rails that's
[2:13:59] come out of that building i was a kid
[2:14:01] once myself
[2:14:04] so i kind of know what kids do but you
[2:14:07] see you know
[2:14:07] i was there when brother braden preached
[2:14:09] invisible union
[2:14:11] i was there when he preached the uh on
[2:14:14] the wings of a snow white dove
[2:14:16] i was there when he said i want an
[2:14:18] old-fashioned altar call
[2:14:21] that's why i still believe in altar
[2:14:22] calls i was there you can't take it from
[2:14:25] me
[2:14:26] i was there amen but anyway when he told
[2:14:29] us about an
[2:14:30] invisible union what brother jim an
[2:14:32] invisible union
[2:14:34] it takes place in the quiet and you know
[2:14:38] it takes place and no noise and it's all
[2:14:40] quiet and
[2:14:41] you know in the cover of everything
[2:14:43] that's uh what the
[2:14:44] invisible union you know no excitement
[2:14:47] no whatever
[2:14:49] and i say whatever
[2:14:52] but brother brad i'm saying if a woman
[2:14:54] won't have a baby for a husband
[2:14:57] she'll take a dog or a cat or something
[2:15:00] she's got a mother something it's a
[2:15:03] nature but to bear a child for a husband
[2:15:05] and raise it to the service of god
[2:15:07] that's entirely out of her line she said
[2:15:10] oh she would be disgraced if she did by
[2:15:12] our sin
[2:15:12] loving society of this 1965
[2:15:16] type of women a true picture
[2:15:19] of the modern church today neither does
[2:15:22] the modern church
[2:15:24] want any of these here screaming
[2:15:26] shouting
[2:15:27] tongue speaking acts 2 38 youngins
[2:15:30] around her
[2:15:31] now i'm just going to tell you maybe an
[2:15:34] invisible union happens in the quiet
[2:15:36] but this is the results
[2:15:40] amen oh he said here screaming shouting
[2:15:43] tongue speaking
[2:15:44] acts 2 38 youngins around her yeah yeah
[2:15:47] she don't wanted him
[2:15:48] whooping crying screaming amen
[2:15:51] hallelujah
[2:15:52] while such a child would immediately put
[2:15:55] her out her denomination that would not
[2:15:57] quit
[2:15:57] that in the churches why they throw her
[2:15:59] out right quick why are you letting such
[2:16:01] stuff go on is that
[2:16:04] it's a sad thing that we're now we're
[2:16:06] now having to quote that the message
[2:16:08] churches
[2:16:09] see she's pregnanted with something
[2:16:12] because she's bringing forth members all
[2:16:14] the time
[2:16:15] but she don't want none of them
[2:16:16] screaming hollering blabbering
[2:16:18] acts 238 miserable creatures she thinks
[2:16:20] they are it would certainly embarrass
[2:16:22] her
[2:16:23] it would ruin her educated ethical
[2:16:26] scientific society church
[2:16:28] that she belonged to here they would
[2:16:30] throw her out at the next council
[2:16:32] she can't have it so she don't want to
[2:16:34] be pregnant
[2:16:36] with the word because that's the only
[2:16:39] kind
[2:16:39] the word will bring forth born to the
[2:16:43] spirit it has the spirit of god in
[2:16:44] no intellectual church joy and creed
[2:16:47] going bob had
[2:16:48] painted faces no such stuff is that at
[2:16:51] all in it
[2:16:51] you don't find that in the word of god
[2:16:53] you find an old-fashioned
[2:16:55] sanctified holy ghost field child
[2:16:58] born to the spirit of god screaming
[2:17:00] hollering shouting
[2:17:02] praising god something like a methodist
[2:17:05] meeting to me
[2:17:06] amen i wish that i wish some of these
[2:17:08] churches would at least be methodists in
[2:17:10] their worship
[2:17:11] like old betty robinson come on church
[2:17:14] amen you say
[2:17:16] i just want to say to you today have you
[2:17:19] had your pentecost where you got the
[2:17:23] victory
[2:17:24] over the works of the flesh
[2:17:27] you've got to cut them through the red
[2:17:29] sea and the blood
[2:17:31] where sin dies and the past
[2:17:34] masters of lust and pride and
[2:17:37] greed amen they all die
[2:17:41] and you sing a new song
[2:17:46] hallelujah listen the bible says when
[2:17:49] the seals were open

[2:28:15] and lord of lords his name is called the
[2:28:18] word of god

[2:28:56] with his horsemen in the sea and brought
[2:28:59] again the waters of the sea upon them
[2:29:01] but the children of israel went on dry
[2:29:02] land in the midst of the sea
[2:29:04] and mariam the prophetess oh hallelujah
[2:29:09] come on now look like they had gifts of
[2:29:12] the spirit among them
[2:29:14] and then the sister of aaron took a
[2:29:16] timbrel in her hand
[2:29:17] and all the women went out with her with
[2:29:20] timbrels and with dances
[2:29:22] and mariam answered them sing unto the
[2:29:25] you to the lord
[2:29:26] for he had triumphed glorious and that

[2:29:39] and running

[2:29:42] well of course you don't
[2:29:44] nobody has to do that to be forced to
[2:29:47] have to do that would be babbling

[2:29:54] see your enemies dead i don't know what
[2:29:57] you'll do
[2:29:58] you might climb the pole like buddy
[2:30:00] robinson
[2:30:01] in your jubilation you might run around
[2:30:03] the building like sister atlanta did
[2:30:06] because she saw she was leaning on the
[2:30:08] everlasting arms
[2:30:10] and that her enemy was dead and
[2:30:14] that put a depth in her step that caused
[2:30:17] her to rejoice
[2:30:19] amen i doubt
[2:30:22] i sincerely doubt you'll say well
[2:30:27] that was really nice wasn't it
[2:30:30] i'll tell you what you might speak in
[2:30:31] tongues like they did on the day of
[2:30:33] pentecost
[2:30:34] when they saw their enemy dead and they
[2:30:37] got filled with the spirit of god
[2:30:39] amen come on church amen brother branham
[2:30:42] said that
[2:30:43] angels are encamped about everything is
[2:30:46] order
[2:30:47] every wall can be took down it's already
[2:30:49] took down the sun
[2:30:51] of god goes before us his banners are
[2:30:53] waving
[2:30:54] there's nothing can stand in the way of
[2:30:56] a saint going to meet a promise of god
[2:30:58] oh i like that death can't stop it the
[2:31:01] grave can't stop it the devil can't stop
[2:31:03] that
[2:31:03] we're more than conquerors sickness is
[2:31:05] conquered for you
[2:31:07] friends death is conquered for you
[2:31:08] unbeliever once you receive him
[2:31:10] habits have been conquered for you
[2:31:12] temptation's been conquered
[2:31:14] you say i i've got a temper i can't get
[2:31:16] over it's conquered
[2:31:17] he's already conquered the great final
[2:31:19] seat of abraham
[2:31:21] there's no more conquering to do now he
[2:31:23] has conquered it
[2:31:24] for us that means all we have to do
[2:31:28] is follow him into battle for the battle
[2:31:31] is the lord and the lord is a mighty
[2:31:33] warrior
[2:31:36] amen brother branham told us over again
[2:31:40] he said that same angel
[2:31:42] of the lord that was there is the same
[2:31:45] angel of the covenant
[2:31:47] jesus christ leading the church today
[2:31:52] going from victory to victory yes amen
[2:31:55] now look look at israel going to the
[2:31:58] promised land
[2:32:00] it was not just egypt trying to bring
[2:32:02] them back
[2:32:04] but there was moab a cousin to them who
[2:32:06] wanted to stop them
[2:32:08] there was balak the king of moab that
[2:32:11] hired balaam to curse them
[2:32:13] and he would have except for the angel
[2:32:17] come on amen remember he said behold i
[2:32:20] sent an angel before you to keep you in
[2:32:22] the way and to bring you
[2:32:26] the angel can't fail if the angel is
[2:32:29] here to bring us to the place that i
[2:32:31] have prepared
[2:32:32] that he will not fail at his task
[2:32:36] but whereof him obey his voice provoke
[2:32:38] him not
[2:32:39] for he will he will not pardon your
[2:32:41] transgression in other words
[2:32:42] he will not allow sin to go unpunished
[2:32:46] for my name is in him
[2:32:51] my name is in him can you imagine the
[2:32:54] name of the lord in the angel
[2:32:56] of the lord amen the name of jehovah
[2:32:59] was in this angel that is to say jehovah
[2:33:03] revealed himself in him and he's called
[2:33:07] in the bible the face of jehovah
[2:33:11] exodus 33 14 my presence
[2:33:14] shall go with thee that's literally my
[2:33:16] faith
[2:33:19] will go with you my presence
[2:33:22] my personal presence and i will give
[2:33:25] thee rest
[2:33:27] and he said if thy presence or thy face
[2:33:29] does not go with us
[2:33:31] don't lead us up from here let us stay
[2:33:34] here if you're not going with us
[2:33:36] we don't want to go now this angel of
[2:33:40] jehovah was not a creative spirit
[2:33:42] but it was the manifestation of jehovah
[2:33:45] himself
[2:33:46] and he went before them in a pillar of
[2:33:48] fire and a cloud
[2:33:50] you know and a cloud to guide them to
[2:33:52] defend them
[2:33:54] and we know now that it was christ that
[2:33:57] is the angel of jehovah
[2:34:00] this angel is frequently called jehovah
[2:34:02] elohim that's god
[2:34:04] this is plainly taught in in paul's
[2:34:07] gospel paul said
[2:34:08] neither let us tip christ as some of
[2:34:12] them
[2:34:12] also tempted and were destroyed of the
[2:34:15] serpents
[2:34:17] amen is that right don't let us tell
[2:34:20] christ
[2:34:21] as some of them also were tempted and
[2:34:23] were destroyed at the serpents
[2:34:25] he called that angel christ
[2:34:28] amen he would rather suffer
[2:34:32] suffer the the the afflictions of the
[2:34:35] children of israel
[2:34:36] and the reproach of christ then enjoy
[2:34:40] the pleasures of sin
[2:34:41] for a season who was that in the
[2:34:44] wilderness
[2:34:45] it was christ is that right it was the
[2:34:49] pre-incarnate
[2:34:50] logos who would become flesh
[2:34:53] in jesus christ not another god the same
[2:34:56] god
[2:34:57] taking on human battles fighting your
[2:35:00] battles going through what you go
[2:35:02] through
[2:35:02] facing temptations you face is that
[2:35:05] right
[2:35:06] he couldn't do that as a pillar of fire
[2:35:08] he did that as a man
[2:35:10] now notice isaiah 63 and 8 says
[2:35:13] for he said surely they are my people
[2:35:16] children who will
[2:35:17] not lie in other words of people who'll
[2:35:19] be true to me
[2:35:21] he said they are my very own people
[2:35:24] surely they won't betray me so he became
[2:35:26] their savior
[2:35:28] in all their affliction he was
[2:35:30] affliction
[2:35:31] in their distress he was distressed
[2:35:34] and the angel of his presence or his
[2:35:37] face
[2:35:37] saved them and in his love and his pity
[2:35:41] he redeemed them and bear them and
[2:35:43] carried them
[2:35:44] all the days of old hallelujah
[2:35:49] mine angels shall go before thee and
[2:35:52] bring you to the
[2:35:53] amorites the hiptites the amorites the
[2:35:56] jebusites and i will
[2:35:57] cut them off i will utterly destroy them
[2:36:01] you're not to bow before they're gods of
[2:36:03] laodicea
[2:36:05] you're not to serve them you're not to
[2:36:07] do after their works
[2:36:09] thou shalt utterly overthrow them that
[2:36:11] is break down their images
[2:36:14] and then i've sent you a message so why
[2:36:17] is it you would rather
[2:36:18] listen and feed on the voices of
[2:36:20] hollywood than the voice of god
[2:36:24] i sent you a message
[2:36:27] why can't you believe it and walk in it
[2:36:30] i've vindicated it by an
[2:36:32] angel my angel has went before you

[2:36:42] and i will take
[2:36:43] sickness from the way from the midst of
[2:36:46] thee
[2:36:47] we're talking about the god that's with
[2:36:48] us i will take sickness
[2:36:52] away from thee he blessed them with
[2:36:54] their provisions their health their
[2:36:56] fruitfulness
[2:36:57] length of life where he said there shall
[2:36:59] nothing cast their young
[2:37:01] nor be barren in their land and the
[2:37:03] number of thy days
[2:37:04] i will fulfill and i will send my fear
[2:37:07] before thee
[2:37:08] and destroy all the people to whom thou
[2:37:10] shalt come and i will make thine enemies
[2:37:13] turn their backs unto thee
[2:37:15] and i will send hornets before thee
[2:37:17] which shall drive out the highlights and
[2:37:20] and the jebusite and the hittite from
[2:37:22] before thee
[2:37:23] amen and it goes on and said by little
[2:37:26] and by little i'm going to do this

[2:37:31] father i mean you'll take a step
[2:37:33] and i'll clear the way i'm going to i'm
[2:37:35] going to do this until you are increased
[2:37:38] and you inherit all the land
[2:37:41] hallelujah you can look back at your

[2:37:54] way
[2:37:55] till i inherit the land ever promised
[2:38:00] [Applause]
[2:38:02] without the angel israel would have
[2:38:03] never made it to the promised land
[2:38:06] he opened up the red sea that walked on
[2:38:08] dry land
[2:38:09] he then turned and then utterly
[2:38:11] destroyed the egyptian army
[2:38:13] he provided word the word of mount sinai
[2:38:16] come on when god's voice was heard from
[2:38:18] the mountain
[2:38:20] he provided water from the rock most
[2:38:23] unlikely place but that rock was
[2:38:25] christ amen he provided manna
[2:38:28] of bread from heaven and jesus is that
[2:38:30] bread
[2:38:31] that came from god out of heaven he
[2:38:34] provided protection from the curses of
[2:38:36] balaam

[2:38:53] flood stage

[2:39:02] fourth man
[2:39:03] in the fiery furnace even nebuchadnezzar
[2:39:07] he said blessed be the god of shadrach
[2:39:09] meshach and abednego
[2:39:11] who sent his angel and delivered his
[2:39:14] servants
[2:39:15] that trusted in him and and have changed
[2:39:19] the king's word
[2:39:20] and yielded their bodies that they might
[2:39:22] not serve or worship any god except
[2:39:25] their own god hallelujah

[2:58:55] angel's food
[2:58:57] amen this bible was a book delivered by
[2:59:00] angels
[2:59:03] men moved by the holy ghost inspired by
[2:59:06] the spirit of god
[2:59:08] it's the book of angels this message was
[2:59:11] a message from an angel
[2:59:12] amen what we believe is a new testament
[2:59:15] doctrine
[2:59:16] amen we are following the angel no
[2:59:19] matter what's around you and how where
[2:59:21] you
[2:59:21] are the angels are watching over you no
[2:59:24] matter if it seems
[2:59:25] nice if it seems that right if it seems
[2:59:28] whatever
[2:59:28] if you've been lost in sin angels are
[2:59:31] watching over you
[2:59:32] ready to rejoice the moment you repent
[2:59:40] angels guarding over you
[2:59:47] you're not alone and innumerable
[2:59:50] that's right you can't count them all
[2:59:57] one angel would have been all that jesus
[3:00:00] would have needed
[3:00:01] that's right but he said i could call
[3:00:05] 80 000 of them 12 legions of angels
[3:00:09] and in a moment they would come to me
[3:00:15] that's what he could do as the son of
[3:00:16] god
[3:00:18] and then you think the devil's come
[3:00:19] along and says your cry
[3:00:21] means nothing to the master
[3:00:26] it's during the angels
[3:00:30] brother branham talked about the
[3:00:31] commotion in heaven
[3:00:33] when the angels looked down said have
[3:00:36] you been watching what's on earth god
[3:00:41] there's some of your children three of
[3:00:43] them stood for you down there
[3:00:45] yeah chad like me sack in the bed
[3:00:48] they've stood for you and they're fixing
[3:00:50] to die
[3:00:52] let me go down i'll destroy him no no
[3:00:56] i'm not going to let you go down
[3:01:00] he talks about another wormwood i'm the
[3:01:02] one i'm the angel over the waters i can
[3:01:04] just
[3:01:05] i can just send a flood right now and
[3:01:07] just flood out
[3:01:08] and put the fire out no no you're a
[3:01:11] great angel
[3:01:13] but it's not your job
[3:01:17] it's my job
[3:01:22] he said he reached up and he got him
[3:01:24] bolt of light and you know brother
[3:01:25] branham in his figurative way
[3:01:27] he swung down off of that onto a cloud
[3:01:29] for chariots
[3:01:31] rode down there with his majestic
[3:01:34] majestic garments flapping in the wind
[3:01:37] and there in the nick of time
[3:01:39] he stood there it wasn't too late he
[3:01:42] appears right in the fiery furnace
[3:01:45] he's with you in your triumph
[3:01:49] i will never leave you fighting alone
[3:01:55] angels watching over you
[3:02:01] before you were born when you were born
[3:02:04] when you were born again when you die
[3:02:10] some foolish man said one time where was
[3:02:12] that angel when william branham
[3:02:14] there where was that angel when when
[3:02:17] william branham
[3:02:18] was in that car wreck and died i said he
[3:02:20] was there
[3:02:24] took him from this dimension right into
[3:02:28] another
[3:02:30] like asking where was that angel when
[3:02:31] john the baptist's head got cut off
[3:02:36] he was right there the angel that
[3:02:39] announced his birth
[3:02:41] was there to take him across
[3:02:44] the river

[3:02:50] fighting alone
[3:02:51] amen the god you serve
[3:02:55] is a man of war
[3:03:00] and when he sees his children tormented
[3:03:03] it makes him angry

[3:03:10] and i have come down to deliver let the
[3:03:13] musicians go
