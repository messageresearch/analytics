[31:18] may this be a moment Lord they are

[31:24] fear and unbelief and they concede
[31:27] herself in the promise of Jesus I prayed

[31:58] crippled and weary and full of doubts
[32:01] and fears believe you
[32:04] you saw us overcoming you saw us
[32:06] shouting in victory
[32:08] you saw us with joy in our hearts
[32:10] because we can declare our enemy is dead
[32:13] that man that we have risen up above the
[32:17] fears in the darkness of the world I
[32:19] pray God you speak today now Lord anoint
[32:23] my lips I to stand here
[32:28] Lord feeling this full spirit Oh God
[32:33] want to move right into that channel now
[32:35] moving to by the winds so the Holy
[32:39] Spirit lifted but not my own power but
[32:43] your power use the speed Lord reveal
[32:47] yourself I pray in Jesus name thank you
[32:51] lord amen amen
[32:55] god bless you and it good to be in the
[32:57] house of the Lord amen well you seem to
[33:01] be getting a little bit comfortable
[33:03] there Amen able to enter in not feeling
[33:07] all uptight and hey man it's good to be
[33:10] in the house of the Lord and be able to
[33:12] fellowship with God and with his people
[33:15] and knowing that um he said he would be
[33:18] here in our midst today and so we're
[33:21] just looking to him to speak to hearts
[33:23] and lives and let him speak to your
[33:26] heart
[33:26] hey man god bless you Philippians
[33:28] chapter 2 and verse 5 and I just want
[33:32] you as you turn to this scripture once
[33:35] again I want to you to let the Holy
[33:37] Spirit really speak to your heart today
[33:39] you just to pray Lord will you just
[33:42] speak to me in a very very real and
[33:45] living way Lord uh not my faith anoint
[33:50] my heart to believe dissolve ever doubt
[33:53] and remove all confusion let me see
[33:56] perfectly what your wheel is for me in
[33:58] my life and I can take my position in
[34:01] the scripture in the Word of God
[34:03] a man's of today we want to just put our
[34:07] home everything into this you know we
[34:11] you know it's it's we've come together
[34:13] to make him welcome to honor him to wash
[34:17] his feet and then to do him a service
[34:20] and you do him a service by in turn and
[34:23] and by worshiping him and and give an
[34:27] honor to his words so Philippians 2 and
[34:29] 5 let this mind be in you which was also
[34:34] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[34:38] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[34:40] with God that made himself of no
[34:42] reputation took upon him the form of a
[34:45] servant and was made in the likeness of
[34:47] men and being found in the fashion as a
[34:50] man he humbled himself and became
[34:53] obedient
[34:54] to death even the death of the cross
[34:58] a man god bless you can be seated a man
[35:02] I don't know if you realize the depth of
[35:07] this text this morning but I hope that
[35:10] when we leave from here today that we
[35:14] have realized the depth of this text and
[35:18] understand a little more about what Paul
[35:22] said when he said let the mind that was
[35:24] in Christ being you and knowing that if
[35:28] that mind comes in us then it changes
[35:30] our character we have become sons by
[35:34] having the mind of Christ which is this
[35:36] character because your mind actually
[35:39] makes your character the things you
[35:41] think upon and and the things that you
[35:44] believe I'd like to look at Colossians
[35:46] chapter 3 and verse 9 for another
[35:49] scripture reading this morning from
[35:52] which we were taking our text and taking
[35:54] this further and he says you put off the
[35:57] old man with his deeds and I put on the
[35:59] new man which is renewed in knowledge
[36:02] after the image of him that created him
[36:07] and then once again of Romans chapter 12
[36:11] and verse 2 and be not conformed to this
[36:15] world do not pattern like the world but
[36:19] be you transformed and that word
[36:21] transformed as Metamorpho from which we
[36:24] get the word a word metamorphosis
[36:28] where is a change is like the changing
[36:30] of an amphibian for example of frog will
[36:34] would change from being a water dwelling
[36:37] animal born in the water breathing the
[36:41] air in the water and he will change to
[36:44] becoming an animal that can come out on
[36:46] the land and breathe the error of the
[36:48] land so it's a metamorphosis that he
[36:51] goes through same thing with a
[36:53] caterpillar you know that changes into a
[36:56] beautiful butterfly it goes through a
[36:59] metamorphose a change same thing happens
[37:02] to you we are changed from glory to
[37:05] glory as we behold the
[37:08] word so he says be not conformed to this
[37:11] world don't pattern like the world maybe
[37:13] he transformed by the renewing of your
[37:16] mind that you may prove that which is
[37:18] that good and acceptable and perfect
[37:22] will of God
[37:23] so again the mind of the renewed mind
[37:27] proves the will of God
[37:29] it goes to manifest God's will again we
[37:34] are renewed in the knowledge of after
[37:37] the image of him that created us and
[37:40] then Ephesians 4:22 that you put off
[37:44] concerning the former conversation or
[37:48] the manner of life the old man which is
[37:51] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[37:57] and which and be renewed in the spirit
[38:02] or the attitude of your mind
[38:05] notice again a renewed mind and that you
[38:08] put on the new man which after God is
[38:12] created in righteousness and true
[38:15] holiness so again we are seeing a
[38:18] creation in the image of God because
[38:21] this is what the new birth does it it
[38:25] creates us in God's image so again the
[38:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the mind of
[38:33] Christ how many has received the Holy
[38:35] Ghost in your life all right then you
[38:38] have received the mind of Christ and
[38:41] that mind of Christ it molds your
[38:44] character it causes you to believe and
[38:47] so then we then we find it finally I
[38:51] want to use this scripture here 1st
[38:53] Corinthians 2:16 for who has known the
[38:55] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[38:57] him but we have the mind of Christ
[39:01] so again Paul is saying we have that
[39:04] mind and that mind then comes through
[39:07] that new birth experience that gives us
[39:10] the mind of Christ so let this mind be
[39:15] in you that was in Christ Jesus and of
[39:18] course then that that means centers
[39:20] where
[39:21] looking at this he humbled himself to
[39:24] become a man now we in turn have taken
[39:28] the exalted thoughts of man and who we
[39:32] think we are as human beings and we are
[39:34] humbling ourselves to reach something
[39:37] higher which is God because it's really
[39:40] higher a man but man has made his self
[39:43] exalted his self above everything that
[39:46] is called God but God is calling you now
[39:48] to to be lifted up above everything of
[39:52] man into the thinking of God a man for
[39:56] you to realize it's it's not a robbery
[40:00] to be a son of God and man to me to
[40:04] become his child to be his offspring to
[40:07] be of his species to be of his kind so
[40:12] if we have the mind of Christ and we're
[40:14] going to have the same attitude toward
[40:16] the word that he did and Jesus did not
[40:20] use his own reasoning to defeat the
[40:24] devil he put down his own human thoughts
[40:27] and he took the father's word a man and
[40:32] he stayed with the father's word this
[40:34] was his mind no matter what the VIS no
[40:38] matter what his father's word would take
[40:41] preeminence right when he met the devil
[40:44] it was not his own power nor his gifts
[40:48] that he used to defeat the devil he used
[40:51] the mind of God the word the word will
[40:55] defeat the devil anywhere any place any
[40:58] time because it is the mind of God and
[41:01] the mind of God is higher than the
[41:04] thinking of man and it is higher than
[41:07] than than anything that that arm that
[41:12] Satan can exalt it is higher than
[41:14] anything the mind of Christ is the
[41:17] greatest level of intelligence that
[41:20] there he is
[41:20] that's why we've spent a little time
[41:22] last sweet just talking about you may
[41:25] have your PhD you have your learning as
[41:28] a man but it is miniscule compared to
[41:31] the knowledge of God
[41:33] that at least in the kingdom of God is a
[41:36] with the mind of Christ the baptism of
[41:39] the Holy Ghost has a higher intelligence
[41:42] than what anything the world or man can
[41:45] produce so now so again the mind of
[41:49] Christ be with you what kind of mind
[41:51] that that he have he had a mind to stay
[41:55] with the world the fathers were defeated
[41:59] the enemy every time a man so when the
[42:03] enemy attacks and reasons what are you
[42:07] going to do
[42:07] hey man if you're born again you must
[42:10] stay with the word because again we are
[42:14] in a day an hour where the mind of man
[42:16] is exalted a man but we are we are
[42:20] saying we're putting down our own mind
[42:22] and I don't think and to receive his
[42:25] thinking
[42:26] now the mind of Christ is the
[42:29] supernatural so the supernatural is
[42:33] super over natural so whatever you have
[42:36] in the natural of man this is super or
[42:39] it's higher it's a greater than the
[42:42] natural are you with me and brother
[42:44] Maddon told us in the seventh seal he
[42:46] said when the supernatural comes in
[42:49] that's the mind of Christ
[42:51] a man so so again that's the message
[42:54] that we have received this is what sets
[42:58] us apart from any denomination Daria's
[43:01] is because we have received God's mind
[43:05] God's thinking about this word because
[43:09] God is his only interpreter and man
[43:13] we've had man's interpretation that made
[43:15] the Methodists we've had the man's
[43:17] interpretation that made the Baptist we
[43:19] had man's interpretation that made the
[43:22] Catholic but no man's interpretation
[43:24] made this message are you with me
[43:28] hey man it was the thoughts of God a
[43:31] Manning to prove that in for God to make
[43:34] sure you knew it was his thoughts he let
[43:37] it come through a seventh grade Kentucky
[43:39] preacher and man they couldn't do it
[43:41] that couldn't even use proper grammar in
[43:44] order to
[43:45] to put down the mind of man and insult
[43:48] the mind of God and he was so time after
[43:51] time this is my mind this is my word and
[43:56] man I know your thoughts I know your
[43:58] heart I know your your condition where
[44:00] you came from what your name is what
[44:03] your address you everything that comes
[44:05] from the mind of God showing it it had
[44:08] to be more than human thinkin and my
[44:12] water just reminds you to I pull what
[44:14] Peter said we have not followed
[44:16] cunningly devised fables a man but we
[44:20] have been eyewitnesses of his majesty
[44:23] in our generation hey man now this
[44:27] message we received as I said was not
[44:30] from the mind of man those even those
[44:34] seals were opened by the supernatural I
[44:37] was high you know was taken some thought
[44:40] sir this man and that man and I was
[44:42] going to say well that's the best I know
[44:44] about it what I read in this book or
[44:46] that book in about that time he came in
[44:48] the room and man what was it God want us
[44:51] to know and how they establish this
[44:54] message is God's mind
[44:57] [Music]
[44:58] it's beyond to thinking of man it's
[45:03] higher than Bob Jones it's higher than
[45:05] any of them these the societies of
[45:09] manner or the the educational facilities
[45:12] you're up man you know it didn't come
[45:16] from a school of what they call higher
[45:18] learning it came from God never forget
[45:24] this is where our message comes from it
[45:26] came from God a mouth and God would come
[45:31] along and confirm it service after
[45:34] service this is me speaking cuz only I'd
[45:38] the word can discern the thoughts and
[45:40] then this real heart and it's without
[45:42] fail is always perfect to give you a
[45:44] blessed assurance to give you a positive
[45:49] faith that when you know it's said it
[45:52] and the message you know it's right
[45:57] now brother branham sitting in white
[45:59] Christ speak I think if any man or boy
[46:02] or girl and I think in an intellectual
[46:05] conception of what they think the word
[46:07] is and so forth will never be have a
[46:10] full foundation until they have met that
[46:13] light that brings the word to a reality
[46:16] I think the church in his practice no
[46:19] matter how intellectual and fundamental
[46:21] it may be that church can never thrive
[46:23] until the supernatural is made known
[46:26] among that people and they see it's
[46:29] something that they can talk to and that
[46:32] will talk back to them that vindicates
[46:34] this written word hey man
[46:38] so again brother Branham would say this
[46:41] in God and God Commission in Moses when
[46:44] a man becomes born again of the Spirit
[46:46] of God he becomes an offspring or a son
[46:50] of God and then he has the same kind or
[46:54] the same type of mind that God has I
[47:01] wonder can you can you humble yourself
[47:04] down for a moment to realize you know in
[47:09] this industry of surrendering your life
[47:14] that God is exalting you by giving you a
[47:17] greater mind a greater thinking than
[47:22] what you ever had before than what you
[47:24] could every cell with having all of the
[47:28] knowledge that the world has to offer
[47:32] when a man becomes born again that mind
[47:35] that was in Christ in us and we believe
[47:38] for the unseen for the miraculous and
[47:42] just anything it allows you to believe
[47:47] for the impossible a man when we have
[47:50] the Holy Spirit it comes to us and
[47:52] speaks us concerning these things and
[47:55] that's a whole purpose of these meetings
[47:57] your Christian friends it is for no
[47:59] other purpose before God but that your
[48:01] faith in God might be stimulated to a
[48:05] place to believe him for the salvation
[48:08] of your soul and for the sealing of your
[48:10] body so the whole message that was given
[48:14] was to stimulate our faith to believe
[48:17] God for salvation of our soul and
[48:20] healing of our body now only the mind of
[48:25] Christ can know your past and mine your
[48:29] present and your future is that right
[48:32] and my brother branham would tell us
[48:35] this in future home he said how many of
[48:37] you wonder then that discernment comes
[48:39] I'm going to tell you it's a it's a word
[48:43] that I say and it isn't my thinking
[48:45] because I don't know I don't know of the
[48:51] thinking of it how can I tell you who
[48:53] you are and where you come from when I
[48:55] don't know you how can I tell you that
[48:59] you know what you did ten years ago when
[49:02] I never seen you in my life
[49:04] how can I tell you where your doing were
[49:07] you were you what your new ten years
[49:09] from now how do I know the future but
[49:12] it's somebody else's thought hey man let
[49:17] the mind that was in Christ being you
[49:20] let the mind that was in Christ being
[49:22] you than it is that you're thinking it's
[49:24] his thinking through you and you're not
[49:28] expressing your own words you're
[49:30] expressing his words hey man
[49:33] so what was God showing us through this
[49:36] side it was showing us that we are at a
[49:40] junction and man were again the mind of
[49:44] Christ is operating to the body now why
[49:49] am I saying that because this was the
[49:51] day where the true Holy Ghost has
[49:54] returned again a man not a justification
[49:57] not a sanctification not just some
[50:00] baptism of it but the very person of
[50:02] Christ coming into the believer giving
[50:05] them the same mind of Christ and we saw
[50:07] it exemplified in the prophets ministry
[50:10] to show you the mind of
[50:12] rice is here and according to the Bible
[50:19] it's to be in you amen now like brother
[50:27] Breton said in anointing once at the end
[50:29] time I wasn't the one that appeared on
[50:31] the river
[50:32] I was only standing there when he
[50:34] appeared I'm not the one that performs
[50:37] these things and foretells these things
[50:39] that happens as perfectly as they are
[50:41] I'm only one that's near when he doesn't
[50:43] I was only a voice that he used it
[50:47] wasn't what I knew it's what I
[50:49] surrendered myself to and man that he
[50:53] spoke through it isn't me
[50:55] it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was
[50:58] a manifestation of the Son of Man and
[51:01] then it wasn't the angel his message it
[51:04] was a mystery that God unfolded it's not
[51:07] a man it's God and the angel was not the
[51:12] son of man he was a messenger from the
[51:14] Son of Man the Son of Man is Christ and
[51:17] he's the one day you're feeding on
[51:20] you're not feeding on a man a man his
[51:24] words will fail but you're feeding on
[51:26] the unfailing body word on the son of
[51:29] man hey man now that's what we have
[51:32] received we have received the mind of
[51:34] Christ and that we have the mind of
[51:38] Christ we know about the sin in the
[51:40] garden would we learn that from the mind
[51:43] of Christ man because the mind of Christ
[51:47] we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[51:49] Christ where did we learn that from the
[51:51] mind of Christ come on a man because of
[51:55] the mind of Christ we believe in one
[51:56] Lord one faith one baptism it meant that
[52:00] our God is not three person but one
[52:02] person and his name is the Lord Jesus
[52:04] Christ and man we had the mind of Christ
[52:08] he's the one that opened those seals he
[52:11] is those seals for the whole Word of God
[52:14] is Christ and Christ is the seals it was
[52:17] open what was the seals in revealing
[52:20] Christ his mind
[52:24] now Jesus spoke and he used the mind of
[52:31] God
[52:32] now he was born he was born a human just
[52:35] like you and I are human safety wasn't
[52:37] sexual birth but he was a man right any
[52:42] man but what was he using he was using
[52:44] God's mind he surrendered his self to
[52:48] the will of God to the mind of God now
[52:53] I'm gonna share some things with you
[52:55] from the word became flesh in India trip
[52:58] report we're brother Branham talked
[53:01] about some of these things and I think
[53:03] they're very crucial to some of the
[53:06] thoughts I want to bring this morning he
[53:09] said what Jesus no wonder when he come
[53:12] off that he'll that night and he looked
[53:13] around that tree for food and there was
[53:15] no fruit on the tree and he said no man
[53:17] either from thee and he went on in the
[53:20] next day coming back the tree had
[53:22] withered listen brother Branham God's
[53:25] mind the mind it was in the beginning
[53:27] that that was a thought before it was a
[53:29] word that expressed Jesus Christ and
[53:32] that same one was expressing that word
[53:35] back so your Jesus was expression of the
[53:38] word can I cannot say it to you if
[53:40] you're born again you are the expression
[53:42] of the word man if you're not born again
[53:45] yet hopefully you have a seed in you
[53:48] that is already and going to be
[53:50] expressed
[53:51] Amen but but again God had it in his
[53:55] mind before the world began of what
[53:59] Jesus would do that tree and here he was
[54:02] the word expressing the word back and
[54:06] every word in the Bible is God's
[54:10] thoughts laid in seed thorn that it
[54:14] received a needy human being and spoke
[54:17] by the same thought that materialized
[54:19] the Bible brings the things that pass
[54:21] see what I mean how powerful could the
[54:24] church be the Bible's a leftist my
[54:29] that was in Christ being you as a man
[54:33] thinketh in his heart so is he now your
[54:35] thoughts if they become an expression
[54:37] this is like God said let there be a
[54:39] world before it could be a word it had
[54:43] to be a thoughts and God in creation
[54:44] created the world by thought first and
[54:47] then he's spoken and the thought became
[54:49] material see what I mean
[54:51] and money sent out that same spirit that
[54:54] said there let there be light and there
[54:56] was light said let there be trees and
[54:59] that those trees and if that same mind
[55:02] that was in Christ being you how much
[55:05] more could it say let there be no cancer
[55:08] and it would be gone let the blind eyes
[55:13] be open and it would be so see it's your
[55:17] thought jesus said but you said but that
[55:19] was Jesus he's away men he said how
[55:22] faith in God for verily verily I say to
[55:25] you if you say to this mountain be moved
[55:29] and plucked up and cast in the sea and
[55:31] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[55:33] what you say will come to pass you'll
[55:36] have whatsoever you said a man what
[55:41] power has been given to the church I
[55:44] said you can express it by mental
[55:47] conception of this is where we're going
[55:49] today because you actually have two
[55:52] minds or two conscience a conscience and
[55:57] a subconscious and receiving a mind of
[56:00] Christ is most of time the contrary to
[56:04] what the human mind is but you've got to
[56:09] believe bring the human mind in
[56:11] subjection to the mind of Christ to
[56:14] where they're saying the same thing now
[56:18] this is gone cutting it a little deep
[56:20] here so I want you to hold real tight
[56:23] because I think the Lord will reveal
[56:25] some things to you that I've been
[56:26] praying about for the last few weeks and
[56:28] I believe the Lord will just give us the
[56:31] key part
[56:32] give me the utterance Lord
[56:37] now you can express it by mental
[56:42] conception but if it becomes a real
[56:45] revelation of God that you see it before
[56:49] it happened and express it in Word form
[56:51] and that word takes ahold and becomes
[56:54] material a thought Express oh my how
[56:57] could how God could have your heart your
[56:59] mind is so in filled with God's Spirit
[57:02] until your thoughts become his thoughts
[57:06] say that's only perfect impossible for a
[57:09] prophet maybe for business but every one
[57:12] of you have the mind of Christ come on
[57:16] hey Mel there you are when your mind and
[57:20] you're leading in your guiding becomes a
[57:23] direct place our direct inspiration of
[57:26] the Holy Spirit moving in your mortal
[57:29] being what kind of people should we be
[57:32] if the very Holy Spirit has so embodied
[57:36] you are empowered that you don't use
[57:39] your own pops and you don't use your own
[57:42] mind and you don't use your own opinion
[57:45] but the Holy Spirit has you so built
[57:47] under your thoughts and your beings is
[57:50] God's Spirit expressing itself through
[57:53] you what kind of a people our church
[57:55] would we be a man a church that only
[58:00] express God stops a man the people who
[58:05] were able to express his thoughts his
[58:09] thoughts about a situation a man his
[58:13] thoughts about your salvation his
[58:16] thoughts about your healing your
[58:19] deliverance a church that could express
[58:22] his thoughts what kind of people would
[58:26] we be this morning at Branham tabernacle
[58:28] was so filled with the presence of God
[58:31] that when what you wouldn't even use
[58:33] your own line you didn't even use your
[58:35] own thoughts you didn't have no
[58:36] alternative of your own but just led by
[58:39] the spirit and they that are sons of God
[58:42] are led by the Spirit of God then when
[58:44] the human element goes out oh listen
[58:47] human element goes out
[58:49] and the Spirit of God feels that vacancy
[58:51] were you into yourself then when the
[58:54] church is in its power of the
[58:57] resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk
[59:00] in his steps his power in his thoughts
[59:02] in his being it is me moving you see
[59:05] what I mean then your tops will become
[59:07] words and words will become material
[59:10] that's when the church in its power a
[59:14] man I believe its own it's rose
[59:17] that when the church will be so wrapped
[59:20] in Christ how many would say the day so
[59:22] wrap me in Christ the Holy Spirit
[59:26] mankind's so far away from themselves
[59:28] that they don't see themselves they
[59:33] don't see their failures they don't see
[59:36] their humanity they don't see their
[59:39] weaknesses they see themself as a son of
[59:42] God but by the blood last by the blood
[59:49] righteous as he is righteous holy as he
[59:52] is holy
[59:53] why do yes he is worthy somebody help me
[59:57] preach now hey man the thing that Darren
[1:00:01] there's thoughts so far away from
[1:00:03] themselves until they don't see
[1:00:06] themselves they don't have no thoughts
[1:00:09] but to serve God no ambitions but just
[1:00:13] to serve Him no trying to be exalted
[1:00:16] look here on gods man of the hour
[1:00:18] but just to serve Him hey man they
[1:00:22] refuse the things of the world and that
[1:00:24] moved in the spirit that live in the
[1:00:26] spirit that walk in the spirit and
[1:00:29] fulfilled the law Christ then the love
[1:00:31] of Christ in the human heart moving in
[1:00:33] the Holy Ghost that wonderful church
[1:00:35] will go forth with power and deity
[1:00:38] because deity will be revealed in human
[1:00:41] beings by the Holy Spirit bringing the
[1:00:44] past that thought of their mind
[1:00:48] that's a high calling now this actually
[1:00:54] happened as a prophets folks worlds into
[1:00:57] existence
[1:00:59] let me say that again this actually
[1:01:02] happened as a prophet spoke swirls into
[1:01:05] existence hey man that's that when he
[1:01:08] spoke engage Haddie ride her children it
[1:01:12] was the mind of God through operating
[1:01:15] through a man that spoke to a storm and
[1:01:18] man they gave resurrection life to fish
[1:01:21] that was more than God given life to a
[1:01:25] little insignificant fish can we see
[1:01:27] that was God sang to us Amen the fish
[1:01:31] has always been the sign of a God the
[1:01:34] Christian Church it was a sign that by
[1:01:36] word a message that God was putting life
[1:01:39] back into a church no longer if no
[1:01:43] matter how dead and gutless said it was
[1:01:45] I men stripped of its life and its power
[1:01:49] and laying dead upon the water the
[1:01:51] resurrection life is here the player
[1:01:53] turns back to life again
[1:01:55] and the power the Holy Ghost moving her
[1:01:57] a man a church said looks hopeless been
[1:02:03] dead for ages I want to say she's coming
[1:02:05] to life hey man I'm saying to you you're
[1:02:10] coming to life
[1:02:11] those are people beginning to realize
[1:02:14] who they are that can say like Paul we
[1:02:16] have the mind of Christ now God was and
[1:02:25] began doing extreme things extreme
[1:02:29] things to show us the power of his word
[1:02:33] did you hear me that was extreme speech
[1:02:37] in a squirrel out of nothing
[1:02:39] speaking resurrection life to dead fish
[1:02:42] hey man come on speaking
[1:02:46] speak into a storm speaking the tumor
[1:02:50] out of a wife come on God was doing
[1:02:53] extreme things to show us what God could
[1:02:59] do when the thoughts of God comes into
[1:03:02] the subconscious of man
[1:03:04] and it comes on his lips that it's the
[1:03:11] same as deity speaking that Satan cannot
[1:03:16] stand before that man don't you want to

[1:05:19] sitting area stuffer and what's wrong
[1:05:22] and Branum there any any praise for a
[1:05:25] man who has no eyeballs this is in three
[1:05:28] days there be eyeballs in your head and
[1:05:30] by that evening you'll be seeing and
[1:05:33] then he witnesses these and I was there
[1:05:36] I went back because he said I wanted to
[1:05:39] see if this was true any and he says he
[1:05:44] said it william branham he's he's a man
[1:05:47] of are they to changing a dispensation
[1:05:50] and we're here in the dispensation were
[1:05:53] that there's a bride gonna be without
[1:05:55] spot wrinkle words she gonna be changed
[1:05:58] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye a
[1:06:00] mint but the thing about it is how can
[1:06:03] we have pay for for that until we can
[1:06:06] start believing in the church for divine
[1:06:08] healing now brother madam said he said
[1:06:20] now listen not with her selfish motive
[1:06:23] let your objective be right for anything
[1:06:30] out said let your motive be right for
[1:06:33] anything out
[1:06:33] side of the right motive and right
[1:06:35] objective God can't use it you know if
[1:06:39] you're sick this morning and you know if
[1:06:42] you need you know there's many many
[1:06:44] people there's that want to be healed
[1:06:46] but they don't have the right motive and
[1:06:50] objective even someone to be saved but
[1:06:52] they want to be saved so they won't go
[1:06:54] to hell or so they can be accepted in
[1:06:57] the society of the church
[1:06:58] then why the right motive and objective
[1:07:01] somebody with me a man but when it comes
[1:07:04] to the word we gotta have the right
[1:07:05] motive and objective
[1:07:07] I'm gonna live for you long I'm gonna
[1:07:10] raise my children or serve you
[1:07:13] I'm gonna use my gift for you I'm gonna
[1:07:16] be a way you want me if you'll let me to
[1:07:18] live if you I'll be a testimony I'm not
[1:07:22] the grace of God I'll glorify your name
[1:07:24] I won't be ashamed to get up and give
[1:07:28] glory but don't listen he said let your
[1:07:36] objective be right your motive be right
[1:07:39] Jesus said once if you say to this
[1:07:42] mountain be moved and don't doubt but
[1:07:45] believe what you said is being done you
[1:07:47] can have what you say what could move a
[1:07:51] mountain stop him in what can move a
[1:07:55] mountain
[1:07:55] can you he told him more than man say to
[1:08:01] this mountain and believe that it's
[1:08:02] being done and he says only deity Kenda
[1:08:07] the mountain only God can do it so we
[1:08:13] beat old man that he could do it if it
[1:08:16] had to be God speaking through the man
[1:08:19] is that right hey man so you did then
[1:08:23] and the only way a man could know it was
[1:08:25] God without it to be the right objective
[1:08:27] and the right motive if your objective
[1:08:29] is right and your motive is right then
[1:08:32] it's not you speaking anymore it's so
[1:08:34] father that dwelleth in you take no
[1:08:37] thoughts what you will say in that hour
[1:08:39] for it's not you that speaks it's severe
[1:08:42] to my father that dwelleth
[1:08:43] you heat death the speaking it ordered
[1:08:47] for the father to speak through you that
[1:08:49] you're gonna have to have the mind of
[1:08:51] Christ
[1:08:51] and if you have to hold a notes you have
[1:08:53] the mind of Christ
[1:08:57] again law of grace now I'm gonna bear
[1:09:01] bear' mine did is what takes to move a
[1:09:03] mountain mortal man can't do that so it
[1:09:08] had to be the father speaking in the man
[1:09:10] and man a man could not create squirrels
[1:09:13] but it had to be the father thought
[1:09:17] manifested in a man right
[1:09:21] a man we're talking about a people in
[1:09:24] this day have in that mind that mind of
[1:09:26] Christ now you see when God speaks it
[1:09:31] has to be so there's no way at all to
[1:09:34] get away from it God said let there be
[1:09:36] and there has to be and a word is its
[1:09:39] expression of a thought God taught it in
[1:09:41] his mind and he's spoken in its
[1:09:43] existence and we have faith in our heart
[1:09:46] the faith of God in our heart and we can
[1:09:48] see it clearer it becomes a faith and
[1:09:50] then we speak it and it comes into
[1:09:53] existence the same thing calls the mind
[1:09:56] of Christ is in the man that's what
[1:09:59] makes the healings and so forth when you
[1:10:02] give that perfect revelation just what
[1:10:06] you're doing then you know how to walk
[1:10:07] cuz that's the Christian walk a people
[1:10:11] walking by revelation this is my allow
[1:10:16] the reach of you and then you're a
[1:10:19] supernatural people you're a super
[1:10:22] church come out I mean you've been born
[1:10:25] of the supernatural so it's not out of
[1:10:28] the region this is what God spoke about
[1:10:31] a people doing now again it wasn't a
[1:10:39] mind of a man let me just stop for a
[1:10:41] minute let me just bring it down to our
[1:10:43] moment I'm it wasn't a mind of a man
[1:10:46] when brother Gary spoke about the needs
[1:10:48] of the church they're laying in the
[1:10:51] hospital three weeks without eating
[1:10:54] dine condition doctor said he was dying
[1:10:57] and the holy spirits fell and healed him
[1:11:00] and gave us God's mind to build his
[1:11:02] church hey man that was the mind of God
[1:11:08] and I'm looking out here we got a
[1:11:11] building falling
[1:11:12] we got people spread all the way up into
[1:11:14] the mezzanine separated different places
[1:11:17] why why God knew this moment was coming
[1:11:20] he knew we would need that mezzanine and
[1:11:23] his mind provided for even before we
[1:11:26] even knew about it come on it was the
[1:11:32] mind of God it was a mind of God that
[1:11:35] drop down that day and healed my brother
[1:11:37] Gary raise him up and gave us that
[1:11:39] unction I know it wasn't my mind my mind
[1:11:43] was already made up I wasn't that I
[1:11:45] would never move from where I was I was
[1:11:48] happy I figured I would live out the
[1:11:51] rest of my life there the rest of my
[1:11:54] preaching life anyway just stay right
[1:11:57] there
[1:11:57] I never had any plans it didn't have no
[1:11:59] ambitions I know people think I did but
[1:12:04] the devil lies on me a lot
[1:12:07] and he's got a lot of fake news and I'm
[1:12:10] not even President Trump but I'm
[1:12:12] trumping that out he's a faker
[1:12:15] but you see but it wasn't a mind of man
[1:12:18] it was a it was had to be the mind of
[1:12:21] God look what happened every step we
[1:12:22] moved everything we did every place we
[1:12:26] turn we did something that was
[1:12:27] impossible everybody in the whole
[1:12:31] community said it's impossible to build
[1:12:33] a building like this and not owe a dime
[1:12:35] on it but it's a whole different because
[1:12:39] of the mind of God or um I'm trying to
[1:12:43] teach the mind that God is already
[1:12:45] working among us we can look right here
[1:12:48] in our own mix it was the mind of God
[1:12:51] that led you here come on man the very
[1:12:59] mind of God they've moved on your heart
[1:13:01] to bring you to this place and set you
[1:13:04] here under this ministry was a mind of
[1:13:06] God - Janet many of you aren't even
[1:13:09] looking for God but God was looking for
[1:13:12] you and it was his mind that moved up on
[1:13:14] your life it was a mind of God that led
[1:13:21] us to Japan
[1:13:23] and man then it was a mind of God who
[1:13:25] spoke to money for it hey man come on
[1:13:30] man and God hadn't ceased providing
[1:13:35] closes his mind somebody with me oh man
[1:13:39] it was mind of God that day that sent me
[1:13:41] to Virginia to pray for a wrong Spencer
[1:13:43] when he laid in the hospital dying from
[1:13:46] burns I wish I had a picture of him
[1:13:49] laying in there all wrapped up and in in
[1:13:51] that in that condition right now to show
[1:13:54] you it was an impossible situation but
[1:13:57] the mind of God sent me all the way
[1:13:59] across into Virginia to pray the prayer
[1:14:02] of faith for that man that God raised
[1:14:04] him up
[1:14:07] hallelujah hey man it was the mind of
[1:14:10] God that saw drew walking mmm before he
[1:14:15] can even pull up good boy could even
[1:14:17] crawl and this kid this child jumps up
[1:14:20] out of the middle of the floor and runs
[1:14:22] for his first time I know my eyes beheld
[1:14:25] it and that didn't come from the mind of
[1:14:30] a man that came from the mind of God it
[1:14:35] was a mind of God that gives life to the
[1:14:37] bearing and I want to say it's already
[1:14:39] in an accident hey man it wasn't the
[1:14:43] mind of man when we stood there in the
[1:14:45] hospital I hope you hear me what's not
[1:14:48] the mind of a man when we stood in ICU
[1:14:50] room waiting there with my wife having a
[1:14:54] brain bleed and saying she'll be in ICU
[1:14:57] room tonight she'll be in a regular room
[1:14:59] tomorrow night and the next night should
[1:15:02] be home hey man you see you know God has
[1:15:07] shown us once more he's not able to just
[1:15:10] do it once he can do it again
[1:15:17] once he saw the church after do the same
[1:15:21] thing again you're looking over at the
[1:15:24] negative oh you don't she had another
[1:15:26] baby oh oh oh I'm saying going to God he
[1:15:31] did it again he did just what he did it
[1:15:36] again
[1:15:45] it's the channel getting open so the
[1:15:49] thoughts of God can flow through the
[1:15:51] body not just through my body I'm
[1:15:57] talking about the church body
[1:16:00] hey my brother branham would take him
[1:16:05] right with his pen the Holy Spirit your
[1:16:09] unction the mind of Christ writing
[1:16:12] something to us hey man and then he and
[1:16:16] we'll read some of that in a moment let
[1:16:17] me just read this from greatest battle
[1:16:19] he said when your mind when your mind
[1:16:21] accepts the life within the Word of God
[1:16:24] that act of acceptance will bring God's
[1:16:27] life into you it's not just your thought
[1:16:31] that does it but rather it's the Word of
[1:16:32] God brought into you through the channel
[1:16:35] of your thoughts see your mind it sets
[1:16:38] it and grasp it and your spirit controls
[1:16:41] your mind and when your spirit catches
[1:16:43] the Word of God the spirit of that word
[1:16:45] brings life into you hey man the light
[1:16:50] the mind of Christ is when faith speaks
[1:16:53] I want you to turn with me to very
[1:16:56] pivotal scripture in this in this sermon
[1:16:59] today it's to Romans chapter 10 and
[1:17:02] verse 6 and I want us to look here of
[1:17:05] the mind of Christ the mind of Christ is
[1:17:08] when faith speaks a math this is no son
[1:17:14] this is not some little name it claim it
[1:17:17] sermon this is not some little
[1:17:19] charismatic message Amen this is a
[1:17:24] message that God gives from his mind
[1:17:27] hey man looky here Romans ten six but
[1:17:30] the righteousness which I'll which is a
[1:17:32] faith speaketh on this wise say not in
[1:17:36] thine heart who shall ascend into heaven
[1:17:37] that is to bring Christ down from above
[1:17:40] or whose son is sin underneath that is
[1:17:42] to bring up Christ again from the dead
[1:17:45] so I want you to notice something here
[1:17:47] faith speaks then we read that faith
[1:17:55] speaks and one's faith speaks there are
[1:18:00] things it says Amen faith does not say
[1:18:07] where is God faith says here is God are
[1:18:17] you with me now hey man faith does not
[1:18:20] say where is God who he's power in the
[1:18:23] heavens and who can bring him down or he
[1:18:28] went into the belly of the earth is he
[1:18:30] really raised from the dead you see Paul
[1:18:35] wasn't aptitude but by revelation he
[1:18:40] knew that Jesus had raised from the dead
[1:18:44] somebody help me preach mm for he man
[1:18:48] about the road to Damascus
[1:18:49] hey man and he said I am Jesus so he
[1:18:54] knew he had raised from the dead
[1:18:56] and he could preach the resurrection
[1:18:59] because he had met the Christ that
[1:19:02] raised
[1:19:04] I want to know have you met the Living
[1:19:07] Christ have you met the Christ so you
[1:19:10] don't have to bring up from the grave
[1:19:11] well you don't have to wear it wonder
[1:19:13] did he really raise but he's here sewing
[1:19:16] in your life I am the resurrection I am
[1:19:21] the life he had raised from the dead and
[1:19:32] he's for your justification I know he's
[1:19:35] risen I've met him
[1:19:37] oh my road to Damascus when I was going
[1:19:42] the wrong way
[1:19:43] and wasn't I got knocked off of my high
[1:19:46] horse my ambitions my pride come on
[1:19:50] somebody and fell down in the face of
[1:19:53] the dust and he he revealed to me I am
[1:19:55] Jesus faith does not look for Jesus it
[1:20:06] does not try to bring him up or to bring
[1:20:10] him down from heaven faith sees Jesus
[1:20:21] so faith does not say has he risen
[1:20:26] did he really rise is he is he the same
[1:20:31] yesterday today and forever gives his
[1:20:34] words still the truth if that faith does
[1:20:37] not say he's way up in the heavens and I
[1:20:40] can never reach it I like it I'll
[1:20:43] excessive that's not what this says this
[1:20:47] is what makes sense
[1:20:48] what's this mercy but what this face say
[1:20:54] is anybody with me what does faith say
[1:20:58] the word is nigh thee
[1:21:02] hallelujah somebody help me now don't
[1:21:05] work who is the work he's the word Jesus
[1:21:08] or God is the word the word has all
[1:21:11] power the world created the earth by the
[1:21:15] thoughts about the word is 90 not up in
[1:21:20] the heavens knock down that you got a
[1:21:22] raise but right here even in my mouth
[1:21:25] what's the and in thy heart
[1:21:30] [Music]
[1:21:31] what came into you when you were born
[1:21:33] again the word the Holy Ghost is the
[1:21:36] word the word is the Holy Ghost the word
[1:21:39] is in you a man it is in your heart that
[1:21:43] it is the word of faith not the word of
[1:21:47] doubt not the word of confusion not the
[1:21:52] word of a thousand voices but the mind
[1:21:55] of Christ is in you the word of faith
[1:22:00] that we preach and if we're back to
[1:22:03] preaching Paul's gospel we are preaching
[1:22:06] the Word of Faith now we got a lot out
[1:22:09] there that has dinner identified
[1:22:11] themselves as word of faith but they're
[1:22:14] not word of faith you are the word of
[1:22:16] faith all right
[1:22:21] amen so watch this the face says I have
[1:22:25] his word in my heart by the Holy Spirit
[1:22:28] the abiding presence is always there he
[1:22:32] never leaves me or forsake me he's with
[1:22:35] me of my good times he's with me in my
[1:22:37] bad time he there with me when I'm
[1:22:40] healthy he's with me when I'm sick it
[1:22:44] don't change he is that the Word of God
[1:22:47] is mighty and I have his word in my
[1:22:51] heart and if the word of bites and lives
[1:22:55] in me come on
[1:22:57] hallelujah then I can put it up on my
[1:23:00] lips and ask what I will
[1:23:05] hallelujah this is what he said if you
[1:23:11] abide in me and my words abide in you do
[1:23:13] you have this word of mine in you
[1:23:15] Amen Jesus would say to their menu you
[1:23:19] are up your father the devil because his
[1:23:22] word is not abiding in you but now I'm
[1:23:27] going to ask you how many have his word
[1:23:29] abiding in you
[1:23:33] all right now don't think it robbery
[1:23:38] think it's what God's requiring a people
[1:23:42] who knows who they are a man they says I
[1:23:48] have his word in my heart I can put it
[1:23:50] on my lips I can ask what I will that if
[1:23:53] thou shalt confess with thy mouth what's
[1:23:55] now the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in
[1:23:58] thine heart that God hath raised him
[1:24:02] from the dead thou shalt be saved
[1:24:06] for with the heart man believeth unto
[1:24:10] righteousness and with the mouth
[1:24:12] confession is made unto salvation so
[1:24:16] when I believe with the heart and the
[1:24:19] thoughts did of my mind confess his
[1:24:22] promises I'm gonna get deliverance but
[1:24:27] the whole secret of it is is believing
[1:24:29] from the heart because there's a lot of
[1:24:35] people making confessions that are empty
[1:24:37] confessions I believe these are crisis
[1:24:39] and son of God the savior of the world
[1:24:41] and therefore oh you're safe now I
[1:24:42] believe they're saved no you're not
[1:24:44] saved until you believe it in your heart
[1:24:47] and that is a revelation and it shows
[1:24:55] them when that character comes in by a
[1:24:57] change of your life we said o'clock
[1:25:01] wasn't so busy
[1:25:07] hallelujah I need a calendar today I
[1:25:15] won't preach plum in the gym but I'm
[1:25:17] gonna preach a good part of this maze
[1:25:22] let's look at it for a moment with the
[1:25:25] heart verse 10 man believeth unto
[1:25:28] righteousness with the mouth confession
[1:25:30] is made in the salvation when I believe
[1:25:32] with the hearts and the thoughts enter
[1:25:34] my mind confesses promise I have
[1:25:36] delivered I have salvation deliverance
[1:25:40] for the scripture says whose ever
[1:25:43] believeth on him shall not be ashamed so
[1:25:48] if we get our believing right from the
[1:25:50] head to the heart and by revelation now
[1:25:55] listen this is a problem many believe in
[1:25:58] him they believe he raised him to death
[1:26:05] yeah but that's a mental assertion and
[1:26:10] it comes from a mental knowledge of
[1:26:13] reading the Bible or having the story
[1:26:16] told
[1:26:16] but mother of dad in Sunday school or
[1:26:19] somebody cozy a man but when it's
[1:26:22] believed from the heart it is a personal
[1:26:25] revelation that he died for my sins and
[1:26:30] he took my sins to hell and when he
[1:26:34] raised he raised to give me his
[1:26:36] righteousness and you must have the same
[1:26:42] personal revelation for your sickness
[1:26:49] Jesus said have faith in God let's go to
[1:26:53] mark 11:23 let's examine this form I
[1:26:56] have faith in God where is our faith to
[1:26:59] be placed in in God not in our ability
[1:27:04] but my words your words are like my
[1:27:06] words they're just human words but if we
[1:27:09] could every find the mind of God and
[1:27:11] speak his mind so the further the first
[1:27:14] thing it says in verse
[1:27:16] 22 is have faith in God so put your
[1:27:19] faith there verse 23 for verily I say to
[1:27:23] you that whosoever shall say to this
[1:27:27] mountain be removed be thou removed and
[1:27:29] be cast into the sea and shall not doubt
[1:27:32] in his heart but believe that those
[1:27:34] things which he said shall come to pass
[1:27:37] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:27:39] therefore I say to you what so what
[1:27:42] thing soever you desire when you pray
[1:27:44] believe that you receive them and you
[1:27:47] shall have them hey man now so believe
[1:27:53] to believe from the heart now you and I
[1:27:58] know already
[1:27:59] it takes deity to move a mountain a man
[1:28:04] and Jesus are saying here that with with
[1:28:08] the born again man there is D and with
[1:28:12] deity there's power and it's the same as
[1:28:16] brother Branham telling us when he said
[1:28:19] you know you've got enough power in yet
[1:28:22] to go make another world and live on it
[1:28:26] if you have just a little touch of God
[1:28:29] cuz there's no weak spots or little
[1:28:32] heavies fire big heavy spots in God but
[1:28:34] the little each touch of God is
[1:28:36] omnipotent a man so believe from the
[1:28:42] heart now it takes needy to move a
[1:28:45] mountain now won't you stop for a minute
[1:28:48] did you ever think about it that
[1:28:51] mountain Jesus pointed to and said any
[1:28:56] of you if you can say to this mountain
[1:29:00] be thou removed and cast mercy and not
[1:29:04] if they don't doubt in the heart but
[1:29:06] believe you can have whatever you say
[1:29:11] do you know that mountain steel is there
[1:29:14] today no believer has ever moved it
[1:29:21] somebody help me preach even Jesus
[1:29:25] didn't move it that's where we need sila
[1:29:35] right here's pause and think on this let
[1:29:39] me think let's go back over it again the
[1:29:41] mountain Jesus pointed to and said
[1:29:45] you'll say to this mountain be removed
[1:29:47] and castellón see and not doubt in your
[1:29:50] heart but believe that you can have
[1:29:52] whatsoever you say that mountain still
[1:29:55] stands and to Jake and no believer has
[1:30:00] ever moved it not even to believe of
[1:30:03] Jesus well the will of God was never
[1:30:10] revealed to move that mountain brother
[1:30:14] branham said if God showed me to go out
[1:30:19] and raise George Washington from the
[1:30:21] dead I called the whole world to come
[1:30:24] and watch it
[1:30:27] that's how certain he was if the mind of
[1:30:30] God spoke then it was going to happen
[1:30:33] but you know he never raised George
[1:30:35] Washington from the dead huh but the
[1:30:43] same as a mountain was moved when
[1:30:45] Lazarus was raised from the dead after
[1:30:49] being dead for days that was a huge
[1:30:51] mountain it was the same as moving a
[1:30:56] mountain come on a man the same has
[1:31:00] moved a mountain when squirrels were
[1:31:04] created
[1:31:04] [Music]
[1:31:08] come on mmm went a little who was
[1:31:11] give his life when a storm of smoke out
[1:31:14] in jigs out of existence when Hattie
[1:31:16] writes children were saved actually when
[1:31:21] you were saved it was the same as moving
[1:31:23] the mountain hallelujah a man that God
[1:31:30] should love a sinner such as I
[1:31:33] where is he would reach down for me when
[1:31:37] you have to move mountains out of the
[1:31:39] way for my salvation it was the same as
[1:31:44] moving that bastard then he was born
[1:31:48] into a mountain had to be moved when the
[1:31:54] tumor was built out of me - Brandon's
[1:31:56] body thousands of miles away that's the
[1:31:59] same as moving a mountain come on now
[1:32:05] when Atlanta was healed of cancer that
[1:32:09] was the same as moving the mountain
[1:32:12] I met with drew up that was the same as
[1:32:15] moving a mountain wouldn't there I of
[1:32:17] grew hair on that bald head that was the
[1:32:19] same as moving a mountain when Gary's
[1:32:22] safety was raised off of a dead bear
[1:32:24] that was moving a mountain a man with
[1:32:27] Jude Oglesby shriveled kidney came to
[1:32:30] life and begin to function normally that
[1:32:32] was moving a mountain hallelujah amen

[1:32:48] in your heart of the will of God for
[1:32:50] your life man if you're if you're lost
[1:32:58] then he wants to save you that is power
[1:33:01] is sufficient that is black steel claims
[1:33:04] that is power still works
[1:33:07] hallelujah this kal-el effect you can be
[1:33:11] saved from the finest sin
[1:33:19] if God can lead your soul to believe it
[1:33:28] hey man now lead your soul brother
[1:33:35] branham talks about the woman who
[1:33:37] touched to him of God of Christ's
[1:33:39] garment using God's gift by her faith

[1:35:20] little deeper but it but I just want to

[1:35:58] brother Tim if it takes hearing the
[1:35:59] voice of God well I I've never had a
[1:36:02] vision I've never heard the voice of God
[1:36:05] audibly I've never even had a spiritual
[1:36:07] dream but there's not listen to me real
[1:36:13] close there's not a true Christian here
[1:36:17] but what God has revealed something to
[1:36:21] you by unction it was the unction of the
[1:36:26] Holy Ghost that led you to an altar
[1:36:34] the unction of the Holy Ghost that led
[1:36:37] you out of the colony hey man come on
[1:36:41] it was the unction of the Holy Ghost who
[1:36:43] struck you as he says he talked about
[1:36:46] sitting on a log changed your life why
[1:36:50] the mind of Christ King Mia when that
[1:36:54] man came in your character changed your
[1:36:57] attitude change your spirit change you
[1:37:01] as a new man the same thing happened to
[1:37:05] you if you been born to give you see it
[1:37:07] was you you heard the voice of God it
[1:37:11] may not have been it may have been
[1:37:12] through a preacher but your iDevice the
[1:37:19] preachers a gift he's a gift of God to
[1:37:24] speak the word where that you can hear
[1:37:26] the voice of God
[1:37:27] hey man 10 it is say it a man when
[1:37:33] sister Therese winters came up having a
[1:37:36] mountain or life that she couldn't move
[1:37:39] of a cigarette habit then her mama
[1:37:42] couldn't get rid of in her own life that
[1:37:46] is that there was an addiction there
[1:37:48] that was impossible to overcome but by
[1:37:52] see by an option or the Holy Ghost came
[1:37:54] to the altar and from that day owners
[1:37:57] never smoked again what was that the
[1:37:59] mind of Christ
[1:38:04] [Music]
[1:38:06] revelation struck her
[1:38:07] I don't have to be bound I'm not a child
[1:38:12] of the devil I don't have to be a slave
[1:38:15] no more I'm free
[1:38:18] the same thing happened to you
[1:38:23] hallelujah gave you God's mind about
[1:38:28] your life you know that's true now
[1:38:40] listen church age book no man knows the
[1:38:44] things that God saved the Spirit of God
[1:38:45] and he to whom the Spirit of God reveals
[1:38:49] him we need to call on God for
[1:38:51] revelation more than anything else in
[1:38:55] the world revelation a man we've
[1:38:59] accepted the Bible we've accepted the
[1:39:02] great truths of it but it's still not
[1:39:04] real to most people because the
[1:39:07] revelation by the Spirit is not there
[1:39:10] the word has not been quickened the
[1:39:16] Bible said in 2nd Corinthians 5:21 that
[1:39:19] we become the one righteousness of God
[1:39:22] by our union with Jesus Christ did you
[1:39:25] get it says we are the very
[1:39:26] righteousness of God himself by being in
[1:39:29] Christ it says that he Jesus became sin
[1:39:33] for us it does not say he became sinful
[1:39:36] but he became sin for us that by our
[1:39:40] union with him we might become the
[1:39:42] righteousness of God if we accept the
[1:39:44] fact and we must then he literally
[1:39:47] became sin for us by his substitution
[1:39:50] for us then we must accept the fact that
[1:39:53] we by union with him have become the
[1:39:55] very righteousness of God to reject one
[1:39:59] is to reject the other to accept one is
[1:40:02] accept the other now we know the Bible
[1:40:04] says that we just saw it on the board it
[1:40:08] can't be denied but the revelation of it
[1:40:11] is missing it is not real to the
[1:40:14] majority of God's children it's just
[1:40:16] another good verse in the Bible but we
[1:40:19] need to have it made alive to us and
[1:40:22] that will take Revelation
[1:40:25] some thing if it's healing salvation
[1:40:28] whatever it is this is justification you
[1:40:30] become his righteousness you're
[1:40:31] justified you see it takes revelation
[1:40:35] because faith is a revelation if you're
[1:40:41] looking in Hebrews 11 and you see all of
[1:40:46] the places is by faith by faith by faith
[1:40:48] by faith by faith Moses my faith in it
[1:40:52] by faith Abel by faith it was all all of
[1:40:55] that is by revelation this is why even
[1:41:00] after you receive the revelation of the
[1:41:03] new birth then you must continue to be a
[1:41:07] people that receives revelation and I'm
[1:41:11] not even talking about revelation of
[1:41:13] deep mystery I'm talking about the
[1:41:14] mystery of God being revealed in you now
[1:41:18] Christ in you is your hope of glory a
[1:41:21] man that you have the mind of Christ
[1:41:24] that you are God's child a man and
[1:41:29] because you're his child his life is in
[1:41:31] you his word is in you and you can think
[1:41:34] his thoughts
[1:41:37] [Music]
[1:41:39] now it takes revelation because faith is
[1:41:42] a revelation look at Cain in the Garden
[1:41:45] of Eden
[1:41:46] now he's religious as he could be he
[1:41:49] brought flowers and put on put him on
[1:41:51] the altar bought fruits in the field and
[1:41:53] laid him there he believed in God he
[1:41:56] works of God he sacrificed to God he
[1:41:59] built a church to God he was just as
[1:42:01] religious as he could be but no faith no
[1:42:05] revelation he did all of this come on
[1:42:10] without revelation he believed in God
[1:42:15] without revelation he believed in
[1:42:19] worship without revelation now when I
[1:42:23] said he had no faith I'm not saying Cain
[1:42:26] didn't believe in God you know that God
[1:42:28] would accept his offering he believed
[1:42:30] that God would and he was believing
[1:42:32] God's couldn't accept his God was surely
[1:42:34] accepted as a man he put his heart into
[1:42:37] his offering but with
[1:42:38] revelation and Abel rolled him back a
[1:42:45] rock and made him a church or worse the
[1:42:49] place when Abel came he came by faith a
[1:42:54] man by spiritual revelation he saw was
[1:42:58] not fruits of the field that caused us
[1:43:01] to sin somebody helped me was an apples
[1:43:04] that they hate a man it wasn't fruits it
[1:43:07] calls him to leave the garden it was the
[1:43:09] light the separation light so he women
[1:43:11] got a lamp and he offered a lamp
[1:43:15] amen the revelation spiritual revelation
[1:43:19] was was three was revealed to him now
[1:43:23] this is the thing you know this is why
[1:43:25] faith is so elusive is because we think
[1:43:31] we're having faith when we're believing
[1:43:34] with our mind and we are agreeing that
[1:43:38] the word is right but faith is not an
[1:43:45] imaginary thing a man faces of direct
[1:43:49] revelation see if you only accept Christ
[1:43:53] as your Savior by your intellect you
[1:43:56] haven't got it yet and then you cannot
[1:44:00] see Jesus as the Christ until the Holy
[1:44:02] Ghost is revealed it to you no man can
[1:44:06] call Jesus of Christ except by the Holy
[1:44:08] Ghost otherwise they're just saying
[1:44:11] words but they're not saying it they
[1:44:14] they they they they not seeing it from
[1:44:16] the heart
[1:44:17] oh man you it's just the intellectual
[1:44:20] faith if we can just get my point down
[1:44:22] to you man brother man and say if you
[1:44:24] can't see this you'll see the greatest
[1:44:27] thing you've seen in years not because
[1:44:29] I'm standing you're saying it but if you
[1:44:31] can understand how that how it is that
[1:44:34] faith is not something just mentally
[1:44:37] perceived but it's a revelation a
[1:44:41] revelation of God by faith not the
[1:44:44] intellectual but by his heart now of
[1:44:48] course that's why we got to
[1:44:51] posin spirits that are at work at the
[1:44:53] world today in this evil age both of
[1:44:56] them are religious aim at one come
[1:44:58] worship in my beauty and knowledge and
[1:45:01] education and science and and the other
[1:45:04] by faith of the revelation of the Word
[1:45:07] of God
[1:45:08] so welcome both of them brother Brad and
[1:45:11] center standing right in this building
[1:45:13] this morning they're right here both
[1:45:16] Heights oh man the church world cannot
[1:45:20] receive revelation they are receiving
[1:45:24] its truths by their intellect and this
[1:45:29] is why the word will not work for them
[1:45:32] it doesn't change them it doesn't heal
[1:45:35] them or deliver them and let me say
[1:45:37] neither will it rapture them amen
[1:45:41] because the rapture itself is a
[1:45:43] revelation now this is very very
[1:45:49] important it must be revealed to you
[1:45:52] salvation is always a revelation whether
[1:45:56] it's healing or whether it's the soul
[1:45:58] body or spirit it's all the same thing
[1:46:01] if they've revelation now let me let me
[1:46:06] just read it to you from Hebrews 4 2 to
[1:46:09] back up what I said about the
[1:46:11] denominational world in Hebrews 4 - for
[1:46:14] unto us was the gospel preached as well
[1:46:16] as unto them but the word preached did
[1:46:19] not profit them not being mixed with
[1:46:22] faith in them that heard it so to those
[1:46:27] them are hearing it to both of its
[1:46:30] freaks but what the word don't profit
[1:46:32] them because it's not mix with faith
[1:46:35] it's not coming by revelation now the
[1:46:40] word alone will not save you or rapture
[1:46:44] you
[1:46:44] it must be mixed with faith it must be
[1:46:49] received by revelation hey man that's
[1:46:54] why a lot of the lot of the people
[1:46:56] around the message only make the message
[1:46:58] of personality cult because it's all a
[1:47:02] mental belief
[1:47:04] when it becomes in the heart you know it
[1:47:06] was not a man at all that was God and
[1:47:09] then you're following Jesus Christ and
[1:47:12] you're in love with him not a man a man
[1:47:17] now again again that brother brother
[1:47:20] Brandon said a revelation what his faith
[1:47:21] is God by the Spirit revealing something
[1:47:24] to you
[1:47:25] that he's going to do are then he
[1:47:26] promised and if you only hear faith
[1:47:29] cometh by hearing but hearing is not
[1:47:32] faith somebody write that down faith
[1:47:35] cometh by hearing but hearing is not
[1:47:37] faith I need some he said about ten
[1:47:41] times where you can get it man faith
[1:47:44] comes by hearing but hearing is not
[1:47:46] faith my loaf of bread is purchased for
[1:47:49] twenty-five cents but twenty-five cents
[1:47:51] is not the loaf of bread hey man huh
[1:47:55] it's a two dollars for three dollars and
[1:47:57] twenty-five cents today by the way
[1:48:00] hearing only brings the word that
[1:48:03] produces faith but faith is the
[1:48:06] substance of things hoped for the
[1:48:08] evidence of things not seen then you see
[1:48:10] you hear the word God reveals it to you
[1:48:13] that it's the truth and by the Spirit
[1:48:15] revealed truth confirms your faith to
[1:48:17] God and that's when God works
[1:48:20] that's when salvation is made when is
[1:48:23] believed from the heart
[1:48:25] hey man now you see you can have all the
[1:48:30] work brother Brendan said you can know
[1:48:32] it from A to Z and it'll never work for
[1:48:35] you you've seen men throw take that word
[1:48:38] and try to make it work brother
[1:48:39] glory to God it just won't work you
[1:48:41] won't get food with the word no no sir
[1:48:44] no matter no matter what you profess the
[1:48:47] word of testifies of itself no matter
[1:48:50] what you claim that word gives testimony
[1:48:52] that's right no Satan knew the word he
[1:48:55] knew it from a tizzy
[1:48:56] watch now Satan knows the word he has
[1:49:00] enough titles to stretch it across four
[1:49:03] or five pages a paper you know he must
[1:49:07] have read the Bible because he quoted to
[1:49:09] Jesus and it's written
[1:49:12] by man and man he said he had enough of
[1:49:15] titles to stretch across for my papers
[1:49:18] dr. Reverend elder pH ll QD and the
[1:49:21] alphabet never away his degree would
[1:49:24] have been in the Bible he knew every
[1:49:26] word of it he knows every word of it
[1:49:27] sure he does so Satan said now I know
[1:49:30] the word Anderson I know he knew the
[1:49:34] word when he came to Eve so he had it by
[1:49:37] head knowledge but it wouldn't work but
[1:49:41] jesus knew it by faith
[1:49:43] in the revelation of God's Word in his
[1:49:46] own predestinated a life he's a real
[1:49:50] hope that's a plug to your heart jesus
[1:49:53] knew he was Satan was wondering a man he
[1:49:59] knew he was a predestinated creature of
[1:50:02] God that God Himself was manifesting to
[1:50:05] him it wasn't him during the earth it
[1:50:07] was a father that dwelt in him and you
[1:50:12] know that you know that yourself you you
[1:50:14] have overcome things that you knew you
[1:50:17] didn't have the power to do it that you
[1:50:20] could not have done it on your own a man
[1:50:25] a man now so again you can have a nature
[1:50:30] given faith you can have a nature given
[1:50:33] patients or virtues or temperance and
[1:50:38] brother men set and the biggest part of
[1:50:41] our faith is mental faith by here in the
[1:50:46] world it brings us a mental recognition
[1:50:50] of God a man but he said if this coming
[1:50:56] from above oh brother if it ever strikes
[1:50:58] this this is there's a real spiritual
[1:51:00] godly spiritual faith there wonders
[1:51:03] faith does that faith only recognizes
[1:51:06] the word you see the mental assertion
[1:51:10] are the mental faith it also recognizes
[1:51:13] what the doctors see
[1:51:18] it also recognizes what science is say
[1:51:22] it also recognizes what the world is
[1:51:26] saying but when your faith comes from
[1:51:29] God it only recognizes the Word of God
[1:51:34] hallelujah amen then that's the thing
[1:51:38] you favor have him stranded not at the
[1:51:41] promise of God through unbelief the
[1:51:44] Bible said he considered not his own
[1:51:47] body now death or the deadness of
[1:51:52] Sarah's womb he didn't consider
[1:51:55] circumstance he only considered what God
[1:51:58] said and it didn't matter if his wife
[1:52:02] was 90 years old it didn't matter
[1:52:05] it didn't matter if he was a hundred
[1:52:08] years old
[1:52:09] it didn't matter it didn't matter that
[1:52:12] it never happened before a man God had
[1:52:15] said the mountain was gonna move and he
[1:52:18] was agreeing with what God said that's
[1:52:24] why Isaac was born of faith a
[1:52:27] supernatural birth and ever child a true
[1:52:31] child of Abraham is born of the
[1:52:33] supernatural now so now again when we
[1:52:39] get that faith of the the gates of Hell
[1:52:42] cannot prevail against us what is faith
[1:52:44] faith is something that's revealed to
[1:52:47] you a man that is not yet but you
[1:52:51] believe it will be a man you know you
[1:52:56] can you can go to a lot of processes now
[1:53:00] your Christian that has nothing to do
[1:53:01] with your soul you're born again but
[1:53:05] even healing is salvation on the body so
[1:53:08] just like you get a salvation in the
[1:53:11] soul you've got to believe for salvation
[1:53:13] or healing for the body it has to become
[1:53:16] a personal revelation you believe that
[1:53:18] God can but you've got to come to place
[1:53:21] and knowing that God will that he's done
[1:53:23] it for me
[1:53:27] you understand that there's there's a
[1:53:31] many a Christian go to heaven early
[1:53:36] because they never get that revelation
[1:53:40] for their healing now your hope you're
[1:53:48] not getting tired on me I'm trying to
[1:53:51] bring some things down to you you see
[1:53:54] again it has to be by revelation God
[1:53:57] revealed to me a man you can take them
[1:54:02] and put them in your mind and that's
[1:54:03] good that's what you have to do you have
[1:54:05] to take them in the womb of your mind
[1:54:07] just keep just take that word in just
[1:54:09] keep taking that word in keep taking
[1:54:11] that word in keep taking it when you
[1:54:12] don't even feel like and you just keep
[1:54:14] taking it and keep taking it in but
[1:54:16] there comes a time that becomes a
[1:54:18] revelation hey man sister Lana can tell
[1:54:23] you she took that word in she took that
[1:54:25] word in she just kept taking there's
[1:54:27] Sunday she couldn't even a soar bit but
[1:54:29] she still tried to take it in still
[1:54:32] trying to take it in what was she doing
[1:54:34] she was she was there nothing let
[1:54:36] letting that word come circle around her
[1:54:39] heart circle around her conscience
[1:54:41] looking around there and believing it's
[1:54:43] starting to you know I know it's true I
[1:54:46] know it's gonna be righteous if for
[1:54:48] somebody it can be right for me you know
[1:54:50] I have a right to to live I have
[1:54:52] children to raise I have a husband to
[1:54:54] see about and what happened sitting
[1:54:57] there what day in the service a man he
[1:55:00] became real to her hey man it was a
[1:55:03] revelation
[1:55:05] and when it was a revelation she said I
[1:55:07] pray and around the building she went
[1:55:11] rejoicing
[1:55:13] hallelujah and I see the same thing
[1:55:15] happened to you when you got saved
[1:55:18] concerts you know the same thing
[1:55:20] happened hey man you were new believer I
[1:55:23] can't be saved I believe it's right I
[1:55:26] believe God's intimacy I believe that I
[1:55:28] can I can be delivered I believe this
[1:55:31] and you're hearing the word and you're
[1:55:33] hearing the word but one day one moment
[1:55:35] it might not have been at the altar it
[1:55:36] may have been in your seat it may have
[1:55:38] been in a prayer console but it was
[1:55:40] somewhere it got down in your heart
[1:55:42] country God has saved me he's delivered
[1:55:47] me that revelation came that's what the
[1:55:50] church was built upon this revelation
[1:55:52] [Applause]
[1:55:54] [Music]
[1:56:01] midlist was said to brother Branham well
[1:56:03] we can we refuse all revelation he's and
[1:56:05] then you have to review Jesus Christ
[1:56:08] because he is a very revelation of God
[1:56:10] to man a man who said except you believe
[1:56:14] I'm here you'll dine your sin a man and
[1:56:19] if you can't believe that he can't
[1:56:22] believe that he says you're lost you put
[1:56:24] him a third person a second person or
[1:56:26] any other person besides God you're lost
[1:56:29] I wonder what these two Lord people
[1:56:31] would say to that one your prophet said
[1:56:36] you're lost and I say you're lost and
[1:56:41] man cuz it's not Revelation now faith is
[1:56:47] a revelation from God this room works
[1:56:51] his faith expressed faith is a
[1:56:54] revelation this is where I want to stay
[1:56:55] there just a moment it's a revelation he
[1:56:58] has revealed to you by His grace it's
[1:57:01] nothing you did you didn't work yourself
[1:57:06] up into faith you ever have faith it's
[1:57:11] given to you by the grace of God and God
[1:57:14] reveals it to you therefore faith is
[1:57:17] a revelation and the whole church was
[1:57:21] built among Revelation now even your new
[1:57:25] birth experience on the day of Pentecost
[1:57:27] that was a revelation he said like they
[1:57:30] did on the day of Pentecost said laughed
[1:57:31] and said these men are full of new wine
[1:57:33] they know it was the great thing of us
[1:57:36] there to those who has happened until
[1:57:38] why it was God revealing himself to the
[1:57:41] individuals that's what happened when
[1:57:44] you got the holding us here was God
[1:57:46] revealing himself to you as a individual
[1:57:49] while others laugh these were adjusted
[1:57:52] it was an individual revelation which is
[1:57:54] faith faith that's revealed if it wasn't
[1:57:57] faith then it wouldn't even be there it
[1:57:59] was faith a man notice he talks about
[1:58:05] David by faith we could talk about again
[1:58:08] by revelation by revelation David knew
[1:58:13] come on he he knew he had been anointed
[1:58:17] he knew the Holy Spirit was upon him he
[1:58:22] knew by revelation that he killed a bear
[1:58:24] that he killed a lion he knew the power
[1:58:28] God was upon him somebody help me
[1:58:30] a man even said they're dying on the
[1:58:33] other side didn't believe it and he said
[1:58:36] neither will the cancer I mean he
[1:58:40] laughed and said and my dog you send the
[1:58:43] kid out of here to find me he said I'll
[1:58:45] pick you up on the end of my spear and
[1:58:47] let the birds eat your flesh he said
[1:58:49] well I had everything for his side but
[1:58:51] said it didn't shake David why it was
[1:58:54] revealed to him he had faith in what he
[1:58:56] was doing he knew what he was going to
[1:58:59] do and he did it because it was revealed
[1:59:02] to him and he knew where she was
[1:59:04] standing and if God just would just
[1:59:07] spits out it and write down in your
[1:59:09] heart that you're not gonna be laying in
[1:59:11] that bed you're not gonna be sitting in
[1:59:16] that chair you're gonna be well that
[1:59:19] could be anything changed your mind
[1:59:25] hey ma'am but he said until that's
[1:59:28] happened every preacher in the world
[1:59:30] could pray I don't say it wouldn't help
[1:59:32] you it would it encourage you but until
[1:59:34] that faith see healing powers in you a
[1:59:37] man it doesn't come from the preacher it
[1:59:41] comes by revelation by faith not by
[1:59:44] power not by night but by my spirit
[1:59:46] saith the Lord my spirit my grace
[1:59:49] reveals to you
[1:59:50] there's nothing can take it away by
[1:59:52] faith revelation Amen hallelujah Amen
[2:00:00] just like the woman that was washing his
[2:00:02] feet I have to get to Jesus she saw him
[2:00:07] with the different eyes she saw him by
[2:00:09] revelation she saw beyond that the
[2:00:13] criticism Amen she saw him by beyond the
[2:00:16] scoffing of the world the society around
[2:00:18] somebody happened we preach hey man get
[2:00:22] with me now just for the next little bit
[2:00:24] she knew that there was all the words of
[2:00:27] the prophets and it was vindicated in
[2:00:29] Jesus Christ is that right she heard he
[2:00:32] was on earth and now she sees him and
[2:00:34] she's seen the word made flesh the
[2:00:36] Messiah

[2:00:40] others and something became to be
[2:00:43] revealed in her heart he can do it for
[2:00:45] me too

[2:00:49] pulsation of her faith of the revelation
[2:00:52] of who he was and the time she was
[2:00:54] living that he was a lab for such
[2:00:56] sinners as she was she went forth of
[2:00:59] service needs and when she humbled down
[2:01:02] to worship him and serve his need he
[2:01:04] said your sins which are many are all
[2:01:07] washed away hallelujah and he said
[2:01:11] that's way genuine healing comes when
[2:01:14] it's revealed to you he was wounded for
[2:01:17] your transgressions he was bruised for
[2:01:20] your iniquities with his trucks you were
[2:01:22] healed when it's inspired to you to see
