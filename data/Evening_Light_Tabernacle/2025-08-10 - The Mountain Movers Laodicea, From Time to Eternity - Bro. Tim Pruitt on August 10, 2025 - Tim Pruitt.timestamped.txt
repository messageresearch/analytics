[20:55] have to be assembled together, Lord. not
[20:57] just under these four walls, but Father,

[21:02] your presence there's fullness of joy.
[21:04] So, we just come today, Father, and we

[21:08] Lord, we want to just tell you how much
[21:10] that we love you. How thankful we are,
[21:12] Lord, for the word you've given us in
[21:13] this hour. We're thankful for this
[21:15] message, Lord. We know it's not about a
[21:17] prophet, but it's about God using a man,
[21:19] Lord, to speak to his elect. And Lord,
[21:22] we're so thankful that you've called us
[21:23] before the foundation of the world.
[21:25] Lord, you put a seed gene inside of each
[21:27] of our lives, Lord. And as your prophet
[21:29] would tell us, it's not the person that
[21:31] comes predestinated. It's that seed. So,
[21:33] Father, we're here today as
[21:34] predestinated seeds, Lord, desiring to
[21:37] hear a predestinated word for a
[21:38] predestinated moment. And may you use
[21:40] our pastor today to Lord, just to Lord,

[21:45] of God. And Lord, unleash our thoughts
[21:48] and our understanding today, God. give
[21:50] revelation, Lord, that we can just climb
[21:53] up to a higher level, Father. And Lord,
[21:55] soar into the heavenlies with the
[21:57] revelation of your word. And Lord, we
[21:59] just be so thankful and so mindful and
[22:01] Lord, so thoughtful to give you all the
[22:03] glory and honor. And Lord, we pray for
[22:05] the needs now. Lord, these that were

[22:19] Lord, battling with this demon of
[22:20] affliction. And we just pray, Lord, that
[22:22] your healing angel go by their way
[22:24] today, God. And Lord, minister to them,
[22:26] Lord. I recall a time where your angel
[22:28] walked down to, Lord, a neighborhood one
[22:30] time and a there was a sister with a
[22:32] guard, Lord, on her throat. And Lord, it
[22:34] fell off that morning because the
[22:35] healing angel came by her way. And we're
[22:38] asking that you'd visit us again today,
[22:40] Lord. Visit these needs, Lord. And Bryce
[22:42] Collins, his little granddaughter, sick
[22:44] with E. coli. May you touch her this
[22:46] morning, Father. Let your Holy Spirit
[22:48] just be loosed among us today. God, give
[22:51] us hearts that can receive the
[22:52] understanding of your word. Father, we
[22:54] love you now. We commit these needs to
[22:56] you in Jesus name. Amen.

[36:08] ourselves to you. And Lord, you know the
[36:11] subject at hand. And Father, the desire
[36:14] that I have to to minister your word,
[36:17] Lord, to to to lay it out correctly. I
[36:21] pray, Lord, that you'll help me to speak
[36:23] precisely today, anointed by your
[36:26] spirit. That is not just words, but
[36:29] Lord, it's words with power. It's words,
[36:32] oh God, that as it is released, that it
[36:35] goes forth and liberates and sets your
[36:38] children free. I ask it in Jesus' name.
[36:42] Amen. And amen. God bless you, man. If
[36:46] you will turn with you, me to your your
[36:49] Bibles and we're going to be looking at
[36:51] Revelation 3:14.
[36:53] And uh today we're going to be um you
[36:57] know here looking at the subject of
[37:00] Leodysia from time to eternity. Amen.
[37:05] And as you're turning there just a
[37:06] moment I I do want to say that um today
[37:10] is brother Ethan Bagot's last service
[37:13] with us for a while. He's he's moving to
[37:15] um Virginia and we pray that God will
[37:17] bless him in this move and grant to him
[37:20] the desires of his heart. And I just
[37:23] want to say, Ethan, if there's ever
[37:25] something we can do to encourage you in
[37:26] your spiritual journey, you have my
[37:29] number, you can reach out to me at any
[37:30] time. And of course, that's true for
[37:32] everybody here. And of course, I want to
[37:34] say, you know, come back home often.
[37:37] Amen. We love you. We appreciate you.
[37:40] And God bless you. Amen. Today, we're
[37:43] going to be um continuing with our
[37:46] thoughts on Zechariah 4:7, the mountain
[37:50] movers. Who art thou, oh great mountain?
[37:52] Thou shalt become a plain, and the
[37:55] headstone shall be called brought forth
[37:57] with shoutings, crying, grace, grace
[37:59] unto it. We're going to look at
[38:01] Revelation 3:14.
[38:03] And unto the angel of the church of the
[38:05] Leodysians, write these things, said the
[38:08] Amen. That's the final say, the faithful
[38:10] and true witness, and God would time
[38:12] after time after time vindicate this
[38:15] message of the angel of this church. and
[38:19] um the beginning of the creation of God.
[38:22] And because this is the hour of the
[38:24] return of the new birth in his fullness.
[38:29] And then verse 21, to him that
[38:31] overcomemeth will I grant with to sit
[38:33] with me in my throne. Even as I also
[38:36] overcame and sat down with my father in
[38:39] his throne. He that hath an ear, let him
[38:42] hear what the spirit said to the
[38:44] churches. Then we're going to go for
[38:47] another scripture reading. This is found
[38:49] in Ephesians chapter 1 and this will be
[38:52] found in on verse three. Blessed be the
[38:55] God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[38:58] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[39:00] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[39:03] Jesus, according as he hath chosen us in
[39:06] him before the foundation of the world,
[39:08] that we should be holy and without blame
[39:11] before him in love, having predestinated
[39:14] us into the adoption of children by
[39:17] Jesus Christ himself, according to the
[39:19] good pleasure of his will, to the praise
[39:22] of the glory of his grace, wherein He
[39:24] hath made us accepted in the beloved, in
[39:27] whom we have redemption through his
[39:29] blood, the forgiveness of sin, according
[39:32] to the riches of his grace,
[39:36] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[39:38] all wisdom and prudence, having made
[39:40] known to us the mystery of his will.
[39:43] Remember, his will is a mystery that
[39:46] he's been making known down to the ages
[39:49] as he would type it out in different
[39:51] characters of the Bible prophesying of
[39:53] this last day according to his good
[39:56] pleasure which he had purposed in
[39:58] himself that in the dispensation of the
[40:02] fullness of time. Now this phrase is
[40:04] going to be very important. So the
[40:06] dispensation of the fullness of times,
[40:09] he might gather together in one all
[40:12] things in Christ, both which are in
[40:14] heaven and which are on earth, even in
[40:16] him, in whom we have obtained an
[40:19] inheritance, being predestinated,
[40:21] according to the purpose of him who
[40:23] workketh all things after the counsel of
[40:26] his own will, that we should be to the
[40:29] praise of his glory, who first trusted
[40:32] in Christ, in whom you also trusted
[40:35] after you heard the word of truth, the
[40:38] gospel of your salvation, and whom also
[40:41] that after you believe, you were sealed
[40:42] with that Holy Spirit of promise, which
[40:45] is earnest our our inheritance until the
[40:48] redemption of the purchased possession
[40:51] unto the praise of his glory. Amen. God
[40:54] bless you. You can be seated.
[40:57] So today as we are looking at this,
[41:00] we're going to be
[41:02] looking about the dispensation of the
[41:05] fullness of times and where we are in
[41:09] time right now. And of course in some of
[41:12] this I will do uh some review and do
[41:15] some supporting scriptures, but we want
[41:17] to hurry as I'm speaking on these
[41:19] subjects. And I I want to just tell you
[41:22] why that I'm doing this. Because the
[41:25] ministry of this hour must stand in his
[41:28] god orained place as a part of the
[41:32] ministry of the forerunner. We are
[41:35] preparing the way for the coming of the
[41:38] Lord. And remember the voice that spoke
[41:41] on the river. As John the Baptist forun
[41:43] the first coming of Christ, so will your
[41:45] message forun the second coming. So if
[41:49] we're preaching this second or we're if
[41:51] we're preaching the message, then we are
[41:54] we are preparing the way for him to
[41:57] come. And so today's ministry under the
[42:01] Elijah anointing and in the
[42:03] administration of the son of man, it
[42:06] carries a a a real sacred responsibility
[42:10] and that is to make a people ready for
[42:13] the coming of the Lord, prepared to meet
[42:16] God. And we, as John the Baptist said,
[42:18] to prepare um your way of the Lord, make
[42:22] straight in the desert a highway for our
[42:25] God. And of course that means sometimes
[42:28] leveling the path and bringing down the
[42:30] towering mountains as we read in
[42:32] Zechariah you know the mountains that
[42:34] are in the way the heels of man's
[42:36] theology um tradition unbelief lifting
[42:40] up the valleys of neglected truth and
[42:42] and until we finally have the road is is
[42:46] clear and straight and and this is not a
[42:49] casual work and I I'm not going at this
[42:52] casually but with with depth of
[42:54] sincerity because it's a holy labor of
[42:58] the last watchman.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; You see, we're crying out in this final
[43:02] moments of the gentile dispensation.
[43:06] And the hour demands a people ready for
[43:10] the translation.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; A people prepared a a prepared people
[43:15] for a prepared place. And for the
[43:19] bridegroom comes quickly and the cry
[43:21] must be go forth with unmistakable
[43:25] clarity. For the trumpet must give a
[43:29] certain sound.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; You see and the and of course it's got
[43:33] to ring out clear loud and clear. Behold
[43:36] the bridegroom cometh. Go ye out to meet
[43:38] him. And today I I must hurry as I plan
[43:44] to take you from time to eternity.
[43:48] And um you know we we've got a little
[43:51] short time to get all this in, but I
[43:54] want to try to cram as much as I can
[43:56] today. And I ask that you'll bear with
[43:58] me as we look into these subjects. Now
[44:02] Jesus established a church would go
[44:04] through a process as we've been through
[44:06] in Mark 4:28. For the earth bringeth
[44:09] forth fruit of herself. First the blade,
[44:12] the ear, and then the full corn in the
[44:14] ear. So we can see that he would bring
[44:16] forth his church back in restoration in
[44:19] stages. And this divine pattern, it
[44:22] shows a church moving from the early
[44:24] growth to full maturity and culminating
[44:28] of course in an end time bride.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; And and so this bride would bear the
[44:34] same life and the fruit of the original
[44:37] seed. And of course, this is the
[44:39] harvest. This is the bride age. This is
[44:41] the hour of full restoration and full
[44:44] redemption.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; And I think I've well established that
[44:48] we are in the Leodysian age, the final
[44:50] age. And and although it is an age of
[44:53] lukewarmness and deception where the
[44:55] false vine and the tears are thrown into
[44:59] the fire tribulation, yet it this is the
[45:02] very hour in which the rapture will take
[45:05] place. For as the true vine matures and
[45:10] becomes the bride that she was at
[45:12] Pentecost
[45:14] &gt;&gt; and the bride yet is not physically
[45:17] removed from Leodysia. Of course that
[45:19] happens when we are raptured but
[45:21] spiritually we have been separated
[45:24] &gt;&gt; the chaff from the the wheat you know we
[45:27] are separation is going on is separates
[45:30] us from Leodosia's lukewarm spirit its
[45:33] systems it seduction
[45:36] until the rapture though we we live
[45:38] under the message of the seventh angel
[45:41] and the final messenger to the final age
[45:44] and awakened by the midnight cry that
[45:47] says behold or look the bridegroom
[45:50] &gt;&gt; and this is what we're doing you know
[45:52] we're we're pointing you the word which
[45:54] is the bridegroom in print form and he's
[45:57] revealed first in word form before we
[45:59] see him in the physical form
[46:01] &gt;&gt; so it was important that a message come
[46:04] to turn our attention
[46:07] um and and say behold or look upon the
[46:11] bridegroom let's look at the word and
[46:13] see what the word says at this hour trim
[46:16] your lamps anoint your eyes with with
[46:18] that provided asav, you know, put on the
[46:20] provided wedding gown that the white
[46:23] raignment that makes you ready to meet
[46:25] the Lord in the air, prepare for his
[46:27] coming.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; And so the call to come out of her that
[46:31] we uh see in Revelations 18:4 that it's
[46:36] not a call to leave the seventh age or
[46:39] time or geography, but to leave mixture
[46:41] and compromise and spiritual death and
[46:44] the Leodysian system. We know it won't
[46:47] be reformed.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not another another
[46:50] reformation and it won't be revived. You
[46:53] know, it'll be judged, but the bride,
[46:56] she overcomes. She answers the knock.
[46:59] She opens her heart to him who stands at
[47:02] the door and and and he gives to her the
[47:05] greatest promise ever made to the
[47:08] overcomers, which is to him that
[47:11] overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me
[47:14] &gt;&gt; in my throne.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that is a promise of a rapture
[47:18] to us here in this last day and to rule
[47:20] and reign with Christ in the millennium
[47:23] to come. Now the messengers cry as we
[47:27] have read you know um and and and we
[47:32] have studied it in in Revelation 3 and
[47:34] Revelation 18 is was the call to come
[47:37] out and and that means to leave the
[47:40] systems that put Christ on the outside
[47:43] of the church
[47:45] &gt;&gt; and the shut will represent those who
[47:48] remain within the formal system and they
[47:52] speak of Christ but they don't receive
[47:54] leave him.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; So he stands knocking, continually
[47:59] knocking right here in this last age.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; But the grain, however, it represents
[48:05] those who will hear his voice.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many will identify with that
[48:10] grain today? You've heard his voice,
[48:12] opened the door, you've welcome him to
[48:14] come in to s with you and and fellowship
[48:17] with together. And and these are the one
[48:19] he's preparing for the marriage supper.
[48:22] So as we go into this, I want to speak
[48:24] about this age. It is the age of
[48:27] restoration. Malachi 4:5 and 6, Acts
[48:30] 3:21, times of restitution of all
[48:32] things. It's the age of the open book
[48:34] where the book is no longer sealed, but
[48:36] it's now open and the mysteries are
[48:39] revealed. It's the age of the rapture
[48:41] when the mystery of God is finished. It
[48:44] is the harvest age, the return of the
[48:46] seed to the grain. It is the era of
[48:48] union where the bride receives her head
[48:51] and becomes one with him. Of course,
[48:53] that's first in an invisible union and
[48:56] ultimately in a physical union. It is a
[48:59] time of separation when the shut pulls
[49:01] away and the word stands alone in the
[49:04] elect. And it is the climax of
[49:06] redemption wherein the bride sits with
[49:09] him on his throne. So it should be
[49:12] unmistakably clear that the Leodysian
[49:16] age is the age where the bride reaches
[49:19] full maturity. Just like the wheat
[49:21] coming to its final stage of growth at
[49:23] harvest time is from grain to grain from
[49:27] bride to bride, from bride age to bride
[49:30] age, from the original bride of
[49:32] Pentecost to the restored ripened bride
[49:36] in this final hour. So when we speak of
[49:39] the bride age, we're not referring to a
[49:41] separate church age, but rather a season
[49:45] within the Leodysian age, a prophetic
[49:48] time where the church reaches
[49:51] marriageable maturity, ready to be
[49:54] united with Christ. And that's the
[49:56] reason the bride has now been called
[49:58] out, prepared, and finally joined to
[50:02] Christ as his wife. You know, actually
[50:05] the ministry of the son of man unites
[50:07] the two together. And so we are actually
[50:09] married now by the message of the hour
[50:12] to Christ the word and we'll go to meet
[50:14] him in the air and go to our honeymoon
[50:16] in and you know in the millennium ahead.
[50:19] But no notice here this is the season
[50:22] where the bride is called out prepared
[50:25] joined to Christ as his wife. Now, not
[50:28] just espoused,
[50:30] right, but married and invited to sit
[50:33] with him on his throne. Now, Revelation
[50:36] 3:21 is the fulfillment of God's
[50:39] redemptive purpose for the bride, which
[50:42] is to sit with him on his throne. Now,
[50:45] the ages, of course, have now run their
[50:48] course. There there is no additional age
[50:50] coming. We're on the very threshold of
[50:54] the end.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? All right. So
[50:57] we are in the seventh age and this
[51:00] leodosian age is the final one. It is
[51:03] the the door to the next dispensation is
[51:06] is calling of Israel and and the
[51:08] tribulation period. It lies beyond this
[51:10] age but not within it. And and but just
[51:14] because there are no more ages to come
[51:17] does not mean Leodysia is already over.
[51:19] It just means we have reached its
[51:21] climax. We're at the very end. And so
[51:25] within the frame of Leodosia, we witness
[51:29] the the the unfolding of key prophetic
[51:33] seasons. And we want to talk about these
[51:35] as we go along. And of course, we have
[51:38] the Pentecostal age, which is the shuck
[51:40] stage. It started in Isuza Street 1906.
[51:44] The Pentecostal era ended with the
[51:48] opening of the seven seals. up to that
[51:50] time it was where God was moving in in
[51:54] uh in his church, right? But the light
[51:57] moved on and the seals came open and it
[52:00] gave rise to the bride age or the bride
[52:03] time. And then of course we have the
[52:06] eagle age which is the prophetic
[52:08] anointing and the vision to rise above
[52:11] the systems of man. But in this eagle
[52:14] age um it it's the last age. It's a
[52:17] prophetic age where there is to rise a
[52:21] prophetic utterance to whom the secret
[52:24] always comes. And I'm quoting from the
[52:26] fourth seal there. And the fourth living
[52:28] beast wasn't was an eagle. As you
[52:31] remember the living creatures before the
[52:33] throne, the lion, the ox, the man, and
[52:35] the eagle. It's the last one. And you
[52:37] just study the ages, study the
[52:39] scriptures, is the eagle in the Bible.
[52:41] The last age was the eagle age. And God
[52:44] likens the eagle to uh the eagle to his
[52:46] prophets. Now watch. He says the last
[52:49] age the eagle a revealer of the true
[52:52] word. And then the last power he brings
[52:54] down the eagle to restore the children
[52:57] back to the original faith again of the
[52:59] fathers the eagle age. So we are in the
[53:02] eagle age under the eagle anointing. All
[53:06] right. Now, of course, we look and we
[53:08] see the next one is the token age where
[53:11] the literal life of Christ is on display
[53:14] in the believer. Now, in Luther's day,
[53:17] an experience of the Holy Ghost came
[53:19] producing justification. In Wesley's
[53:22] day, there was an experience that
[53:24] accompanied the revelation of the word.
[53:27] Amen. So, that was a sanctified light.
[53:30] It was an experience in the Holy Ghost
[53:32] where they was produced a sanctified
[53:36] life. And as more light came on the
[53:39] Isuza movement at the dawn of this age,
[53:42] an experience of the Holy Ghost came
[53:44] producing gifts of the Holy Spirit. But
[53:47] in our day, an experience of the Holy
[53:50] Ghost came um producing the full word in
[53:55] manifestation.
[53:56] Now, so we're not just a justified
[53:59] people or just a sanctified people or
[54:02] just a a a spirit anointed people
[54:05] baptized. We have the full word in its
[54:08] manifestation. So with it comes the
[54:11] fullness of the Holy Ghost producing the
[54:13] token age. Now in the then of course the
[54:17] bride age. The bride age is the full
[54:19] maturity and readiness of the elect
[54:22] church. the rise of the elect lady
[54:25] prepared to meet the bridegroom where
[54:26] the church returns to the bride that she
[54:29] was at Pentecost. And then you finally
[54:31] have the gr grain age and we could
[54:34] probably pick out some more of these
[54:35] that brother Brandham talks about age of
[54:37] adoption different ones but we have the
[54:40] the grain age where the grain of wheat
[54:44] uh planted at Pentecost is once again
[54:47] the grain at the harvest time. So this
[54:50] is where we are. All of these things
[54:52] here unfold in within Leodysa, not
[54:57] beyond it. The true elected age are
[55:00] those who leave the shut, the
[55:02] Pentecostal age, and become the grain,
[55:05] who receive the open seals, rise in the
[55:09] eagle anointing, sealed with token life.
[55:12] Oh, think of this. They are revealed as
[55:15] the living bride. Those who are alive
[55:16] and remain at the coming of the Lord.
[55:19] And and these are those that overcome,
[55:21] who hear the final call, who make
[55:24] themselves ready. They are the people of
[55:27] the bride age. You, my friend, are here
[55:30] in this last leodian age in the bride
[55:34] season, bride time, bride age.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; And now, what defines the bride age? The
[55:39] bride age is not another segment of
[55:42] church history. It is the climatic
[55:44] season in which the true church, the
[55:47] bride of Christ, returns to what she was
[55:51] in her beginning. It is the final stage
[55:54] of God's redemptive work before the
[55:58] resurrection and the rapture. So, we're
[56:00] here in the final stage. And though it
[56:03] unfolds within the Leodysian church age,
[56:07] it's still yet distinct from Leodysia.
[56:09] It's a called out people from within the
[56:11] age responding to the voice of the
[56:14] bridegroom.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So again, it just as a type of
[56:19] wheat, the original seed planted at
[56:21] Pentecost, it went through that long
[56:23] process. It went from um it went from
[56:27] excuse me it went from um this long
[56:30] process of stalks shut and now in the
[56:34] time of the harvest the life has now
[56:37] returned to the grain and what was
[56:40] planted is now reproduced again. Now not
[56:45] a replica of the husk but the seed
[56:47] itself. All right. The identical in life
[56:51] and nature to the original. So the bride
[56:55] age is the era of time when within the
[56:59] last age when the life leaves the shop
[57:02] and enters into the grain for the
[57:05] harvest. And the bride age is a season
[57:08] of restoration. is prophesied in Malachi
[57:11] 4:5 and 6 when the spirit of the Elijah
[57:14] would turn the hearts of the children
[57:16] back to the apostolic faith of their
[57:18] Pentecostal fathers. It's not a return
[57:21] to a denominational movement of
[57:23] Pentecost, but you rather a return to
[57:26] the faith, the doctrine and power of the
[57:29] original Pentecost under the full
[57:32] headship of the word. So this is an era
[57:35] of time in which the bride receives
[57:37] Christ as her head. Not some
[57:40] denominational head, not a man, not a
[57:43] creed, but the revealed word. Amen. And
[57:46] the revealed word she receives him as
[57:48] her Lord, as her husband. And this union
[57:52] of the word and bride brings about
[57:55] brings about the fulfillment of
[57:57] Revelation 19:7. The his wife hath made
[58:01] herself ready. So, she is no longer
[58:05] merely a church. She is a word-born
[58:08] bride, the lamb's wife, united with him
[58:12] in covenant and in life.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Now, I I'm
[58:16] purposely trying to methodically teach
[58:19] this and go as quickly as I can because
[58:21] I'm trying to get and I I'm not going to
[58:23] make any more excuses for time that I'm
[58:25] taking. I'm just going to go really
[58:27] quick as I can so we can reach eternity.
[58:30] Amen.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the time of harvest.
[58:35] It's the ripening under the evening sun
[58:38] where the bride is gathered for the
[58:40] rapture. Just like Boaz, you know, when
[58:43] he claimed Ruth as his own. So Christ is
[58:45] redeeming his elect bride to bring her
[58:48] into the marriage supper of the lamb.
[58:51] And there's no other age, I want you to
[58:53] get this. No other age was the reward
[58:57] given in this one to to him that
[59:00] overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me
[59:03] in my throne. No other age is given
[59:05] this. We are the age of the rapture.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; We are the age of the lamb's wife. This
[59:13] is the bride age. And this is God's
[59:17] crowning achievement. The full purpose
[59:20] of redemption fulfilled. Not just to
[59:23] forgive sin, not merely to establish a
[59:26] church, but to bring forth a bride in
[59:28] his own image, a people in whom the
[59:31] fullness of the word has been made
[59:34] manifest. I'm talking about you this
[59:37] morning. Now I'm going to end this take
[59:40] the liberty to examine a couple of
[59:42] quotes that has been mis construed and
[59:44] misplaced caused a lot of
[59:46] misunderstanding
[59:48] because it's important that these
[59:50] crooked places be made straight.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somehow another I turned me off.
[59:58] There we go. All right. So now as we are
[1:00:02] looking at this quote right here, notice
[1:00:05] it in this is found in the breach.
[1:00:08] Notice it's not revealed. This book is
[1:00:10] not revealed until the church ages and
[1:00:14] denominational ages is run out and
[1:00:16] there's time no more. It's only revealed
[1:00:19] after the church ages denominational
[1:00:21] ages has run out. So, if you notice
[1:00:24] this, um, this seems to elude that God
[1:00:29] doesn't reveal the book. He doesn't open
[1:00:32] the seal until the ages are over. But
[1:00:38] you see this, and this has been taken
[1:00:39] out of context to suggest that the
[1:00:42] church ages are already complete. You
[1:00:45] know, they're already finished at
[1:00:47] Leodysia's ended, the bride's entered,
[1:00:49] and now into a separate age.
[1:00:52] And we must be careful that
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; because when we do this, you can be led
[1:00:57] out to believe anything under another
[1:00:59] messenger or another message. We must
[1:01:03] realize the age that we're in and not
[1:01:06] allow ourselves to be led out somewhere
[1:01:08] else.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; All right. So, you see, um I I want to
[1:01:13] make clear what the prophet is saying.
[1:01:15] The key phrase here is run out. It
[1:01:18] doesn't mean the seventh church age le
[1:01:21] oysia has ended but rather the church
[1:01:24] ages has reached their final stage the
[1:01:28] last age. There are no more ages to
[1:01:31] come.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; The term runs out signifies that we have
[1:01:36] arrived at the last chapter.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Okay, not that that chapter is closed.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; We're just in the last chapter. So the,
[1:01:46] you know, is not closed. It's not
[1:01:48] finished. Now, Brother Brandham explains
[1:01:51] this terminology that he uses. Let me
[1:01:54] see here. Um, and and here he says he
[1:01:59] explains this terminology when they
[1:02:01] actually mistook him to thinking that
[1:02:04] mercy was over. And he said, "Here's
[1:02:06] where I think you get it. It's about the
[1:02:08] finishing of the seven churches and the
[1:02:10] seven seals being loosed. The seven
[1:02:12] seals is manifested. what takes place
[1:02:15] and what has took place the seventh
[1:02:17] church age. We're at the end of the
[1:02:20] seventh church age. When I say the end,
[1:02:24] that doesn't mean it's this very hour,
[1:02:27] this very minute.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; So he explains this to his way of
[1:02:32] speaking. He said when I say the end,
[1:02:34] I'm not talking about this moment, you
[1:02:36] know, this very hour. But we we are
[1:02:39] here. we have reached the the last age.
[1:02:43] And so likewise, the phrase, you know,
[1:02:46] that time is no more is not referring to
[1:02:48] the end of chronological time or that we
[1:02:52] have somehow been caught up out of the
[1:02:53] last age into an eternal age, but it
[1:02:56] echoes Revelation 10:6 where the mighty
[1:02:59] angel declares that there should be time
[1:03:02] no longer. And this of course refers to
[1:03:05] God's dealing through the ending of
[1:03:08] God's dealing through organized
[1:03:11] denominational systems.
[1:03:14] God's method has shifted from the
[1:03:17] corporate church world to the bride.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; All right. So I want you to see what
[1:03:23] brother Brandham is emphasizing here in
[1:03:26] this. He he's emphasizing the book the
[1:03:29] revelation of the seven seals is open
[1:03:32] after denominational ages have run their
[1:03:34] course are no longer they are no longer
[1:03:36] the channel through what which god is
[1:03:39] working now if you'll study the message
[1:03:41] you'll find the channel god works in the
[1:03:43] end time and that channel is a prophetic
[1:03:45] voice
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; amen he no longer working through
[1:03:49] theologians or reformers but through a
[1:03:51] prophet
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; and that is the channel through which
[1:03:53] god is working we are in the final age
[1:03:56] le oysia which is ongoing. It is not
[1:03:59] ended, but we're at its climax. God has
[1:04:02] turned from the systems of man to a
[1:04:04] called out bride who is being ready for
[1:04:06] the made ready for the rapture. The
[1:04:08] confusion of the religious world with
[1:04:11] its many splinters, sex contradiction is
[1:04:13] a direct result of man departing from
[1:04:16] the word and building denominations
[1:04:18] around partial truths. So this statement
[1:04:22] does not mean the seven church ages are
[1:04:24] over in time but that the sequence is
[1:04:27] complete
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; and we are in the last age and God is
[1:04:32] now revealing his mystery to those who
[1:04:36] are no longer part of the denominational
[1:04:38] confusion but are part of the word
[1:04:41] bride. In fact, he makes it clear the
[1:04:44] book is open in the Leodysian age not
[1:04:48] after it's over. And I'm going to just
[1:04:50] show you a few right here. And I'm
[1:04:52] taking the snippet up the top in the
[1:04:54] green. This is this book is not revealed
[1:04:56] until the church ages, denominational
[1:04:58] ages is over. And you'll see all of
[1:05:00] these I have listed is from the breach.
[1:05:02] At the sounding of the seventh church
[1:05:04] age, the last church age, all the loose
[1:05:06] ends of all these church ages that have
[1:05:08] been proved probed at will be wound up
[1:05:10] together. But then in the last age, all
[1:05:12] these mysteries are to be solved out and
[1:05:14] handed out and the seals are be opened
[1:05:16] by the lamb revealed to the church. Mas
[1:05:19] broke the seals, revealed the mystery,
[1:05:20] revealed them to where? To the last
[1:05:22] church age, the only one that's living,
[1:05:24] the rest of them sleeping. The seals is
[1:05:26] broke. Why? In the last church age to
[1:05:29] reveal these truths. So, brother
[1:05:30] Brandham in the same sermon is is
[1:05:33] declaring it all is revealed in the last
[1:05:36] church age, not outside the church age.
[1:05:39] So when he is saying that after the
[1:05:42] church ages you know that and
[1:05:44] denominational ages is over it means we
[1:05:47] have we have reached the end we have
[1:05:49] come the sequence of numbers is
[1:05:52] complete.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; We have now come to the last church age.
[1:05:56] Now so these these um so these have been
[1:06:01] like I said are statements from the same
[1:06:03] same sermon. Now um of course now we we
[1:06:07] understand the these things and and um
[1:06:11] you know want want to comp realize and
[1:06:14] we're comparing again um this is finally
[1:06:17] in the rapture message when the last
[1:06:19] message is brother Brandon preaches
[1:06:20] before he departs and he says the book
[1:06:22] was written and remember it was sealed
[1:06:24] with seven seals his seven seals was not
[1:06:27] to be opened revelation 10 till the
[1:06:28] sounding of the last earthly angel on
[1:06:31] earth leodysian or revelation 10:7
[1:06:33] Seven. See, in the days of the sounding
[1:06:36] of the seventh angel, seventh angel
[1:06:38] message, um, seventh angel, the mystery
[1:06:41] of God should be finished in that age.
[1:06:43] And that's the age that we're living. I
[1:06:45] want you to compare it. We all know we
[1:06:47] are living in the Leodysian age. There
[1:06:49] will be never be another age to it. It
[1:06:52] can't be. So, we are living in the
[1:06:54] Leodysian age. And these seals held the
[1:06:57] book is a mystery. The people should be
[1:06:59] open at that day. That's what he
[1:07:01] promised. So you can see, you know, you
[1:07:04] can't use that quote to say, "Oh, well,
[1:07:07] you know, the ages, we're not no longer
[1:07:09] in the Leodysian age." Brother Brandham
[1:07:12] is very clear where we're living.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this book, the full revelation
[1:07:18] word is not open till the church ages,
[1:07:21] denominational ages have finished their
[1:07:24] course and we reach the last one. If it
[1:07:28] is revealed after the organized church
[1:07:31] has reached its final stage and then
[1:07:34] time for denominational ages has has is
[1:07:38] to be no more. Not in the sense that
[1:07:41] time or the age has ended, but that
[1:07:44] God's time of dealing through
[1:07:46] denominational systems is over with.
[1:07:50] Now, so you're not saying the age is
[1:07:52] finished, but rather that this is the
[1:07:54] final age and we're living in its climax
[1:07:57] and the seven ages are complete in
[1:08:00] number and there's not another age to
[1:08:02] follow. So the door to of to
[1:08:04] denominationalism has closed. God no
[1:08:07] longer uses that system. He did in its
[1:08:10] time. They were the life in their age.
[1:08:13] In their time, the life would pass
[1:08:15] through them. So we we find that God is
[1:08:18] no longer working through organized
[1:08:19] system. His dealings are now with
[1:08:22] individuals with his called out bride.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is exactly why there's so
[1:08:29] much confusion in the religious world
[1:08:32] today. I just want to take a minute on
[1:08:34] this. People latch on to a piece of
[1:08:37] truth
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; and they form a doctrine around it
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; and one claims this is it and another
[1:08:43] says no this it isn't. this is it
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; and the result there's hundreds of
[1:08:48] man-made organizations
[1:08:50] and yet people are still asking what is
[1:08:52] the truth
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; and that's the condition of our day and
[1:08:56] brother Brandham condemned the the
[1:08:59] creeds of men beliefs that are built
[1:09:02] around a verse or two of the Bible
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; right
[1:09:06] they they build it around a verse or two
[1:09:09] and ignore the rest of the word let's
[1:09:11] take for example water baptism you know
[1:09:14] Many will cling to the trinitarian
[1:09:17] formula of father, son, and holy ghost
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; yet overlook the overwhelming evidence
[1:09:24] of how the apostles applied this
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; by immersing in the name of the lord
[1:09:29] Jesus Christ.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; So they will build a creed. A creed
[1:09:33] simply means I this is what I believe.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. uh and and if this creed is built
[1:09:39] on one or two scriptures without
[1:09:41] considering the whole picture
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; and this message brings us back to
[1:09:46] consider all of the scripture and it has
[1:09:49] to line up from Genesis to Revelation.
[1:09:52] So the church ages have ended in terms
[1:09:54] of purpose and succession but the
[1:09:57] seventh church age le oysia is still
[1:09:59] ongoing till the rapture. And in this
[1:10:02] hour the mystery of the word is being
[1:10:06] revealed outside of the systems of man
[1:10:10] to prepare people that have been
[1:10:13] prepared to receive it. Now, it is
[1:10:16] absolutely correct that the bride is no
[1:10:20] longer in the Pentecostal shuck age,
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; right? Amen. We're not in the shuck
[1:10:26] portion because she'd been called out of
[1:10:29] the Isuza Pentecostal age that the age
[1:10:31] started with into the bride era within
[1:10:35] Leodosa. But this call is a call to come
[1:10:38] out of men's traditions, out of
[1:10:40] lukewarmness, to put away blindness, to
[1:10:43] get rid of the arrogant Christ rejection
[1:10:46] claim that we are in need of nothing. It
[1:10:48] is not a call out of the age, however,
[1:10:51] for the only way out of this age is a
[1:10:54] rapture.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I'm going to look at another
[1:10:59] quote right here that is being misused.
[1:11:02] And that and this is from the future
[1:11:04] home. And now in Ephesians 1:10 is
[1:11:07] called, if you're putting it down,
[1:11:08] Ephesians 1:10 is called not a
[1:11:10] dispensation. Of course, we know the
[1:11:12] Bible said in the dispensation. So he's
[1:11:14] correct himself and and he said not the
[1:11:17] seventh day, which is what he meant to
[1:11:19] say. It's was called the fullness of
[1:11:22] time. And when the fullness of time has
[1:11:24] come, that's when time has been
[1:11:25] fulfilled. When there's no more time,
[1:11:28] then you go into eternity after the
[1:11:30] seventh church age is over. And it is
[1:11:33] the Leodysian age is over and the
[1:11:36] Methodist age is over. Pentecostal age
[1:11:38] is over. And now you go into what?
[1:11:40] Eternity. No more sevens, no more
[1:11:42] threes, no more others. They're in
[1:11:44] eternity where there is no such time as
[1:11:47] numbers and times and things. Amen. Oh
[1:11:50] my. You see it now. All right. So, we're
[1:11:52] going to we're going to look at this
[1:11:56] because in this sermon, brother Brandham
[1:12:00] makes this prophetic um statement
[1:12:03] regarding the end of the ages and the
[1:12:06] dawning of eternity. Now, people will,
[1:12:10] you know, will mistakenly
[1:12:12] draw this statement out of context
[1:12:14] believing he's saying that the Leodysian
[1:12:16] church age has already ended. Then if
[1:12:18] you just take the snippet after this
[1:12:20] seventh church age is over and it is
[1:12:24] well you can run with that
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; just like they run with the trinitarian
[1:12:29] formula.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want you to see that as you
[1:12:36] say, as you see here, notice when there
[1:12:38] is no more time, then you go into
[1:12:41] eternity after the seventh church age is
[1:12:44] over and it is and Luther's age and
[1:12:46] Methodist age and Pentecost and you go
[1:12:50] into eternity and there's no more
[1:12:51] sevens, no more threes, no more numbers,
[1:12:53] no such things as times and so on. So
[1:12:56] now I I want to try to to get this where
[1:13:00] we understand where when there is no
[1:13:04] more time. Now here we're going to go to
[1:13:08] talking about time and brother Brandham
[1:13:10] in lifting up him out of history. He
[1:13:13] said we're standing tonight upon the
[1:13:15] brim and we're watching to come to pass
[1:13:18] and unfold two great scenes. And those
[1:13:21] two great scenes are these. One of them
[1:13:24] the ending of history and the other one
[1:13:27] is the ending of time. And many great
[1:13:30] men down through the ages has long to
[1:13:34] see this hour that we are now
[1:13:35] approaching. And as we live in this
[1:13:37] glorious setting of mortal sun and the
[1:13:40] breaking of the eternal light, I do
[1:13:42] believe we're living in one of the
[1:13:43] grandest ages that man has ever been
[1:13:45] permitted to live because it is the
[1:13:48] closing out of time and the blending in
[1:13:51] of eternity. Notice time is closing out
[1:13:55] and eternity is blending in. Now, that's
[1:13:58] going to be a key phrase as we go along
[1:14:01] because it doesn't just come and all the
[1:14:04] world and everything goes into eternity,
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; but actually it's God calling first an
[1:14:10] elect, a bride of the earth into
[1:14:13] eternity. And that while the earth is
[1:14:16] still in time even during the
[1:14:18] millennium. So we're going to look at
[1:14:20] this at the ending of time and the
[1:14:22] blending of eternity. Now brother
[1:14:24] Brandham tells us about this age the
[1:14:26] last gift being added in the Leodysian
[1:14:29] age which is the seventh angel's time to
[1:14:32] preach in the Leodysian age. That time
[1:14:35] that they would be a lot of things that
[1:14:38] was so misconstrued down to the ages.
[1:14:40] And in invisible union he enlarges the
[1:14:43] same thought. He said, "I'm thankful to
[1:14:45] God to be living in this time at the
[1:14:47] closing scenes of this world's history."
[1:14:49] I don't know if it if I would have say
[1:14:52] so before the foundation of the world.
[1:14:55] And the God who laid out the whole
[1:14:57] program to me said to me, "I want you to
[1:14:59] preach. Now, what age do you desire to
[1:15:02] go to earth to preach?" I would have
[1:15:05] chose this age for I think this is the
[1:15:09] golden age. So the age that we are in is
[1:15:13] a very very grand age. It is a golden
[1:15:18] age.
[1:15:20] So I we're going to find out what is so
[1:15:24] grand about it as he says and how can
[1:15:27] overcome. We see this age is the um uh
[1:15:33] that we're living in is one of the
[1:15:35] grandest of all ages. Now he makes it
[1:15:37] clear this Leodysian church age is the
[1:15:41] grandest of all the church ages. Why?
[1:15:46] Because it is the ending of time and the
[1:15:50] blending of eternity.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; So it's the grandest of all ages. It's
[1:15:55] the golden age. It's the age. He said,
[1:15:58] "If I could choose a time to preach, it
[1:15:59] would be." He said, "The seventh angel's
[1:16:01] time to preach." All of this happens
[1:16:04] here. Now, so then we're going to look
[1:16:07] and we're going to ask when did the
[1:16:09] eternals give way to time? Time began
[1:16:14] when man stepped out of eternal
[1:16:17] fellowship with God into mortality.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; When sin severed him from the eternal
[1:16:24] realm. Notice Genesis 2:17. But the of
[1:16:28] the tree of knowledge of good and evil,
[1:16:30] thou shalt not eat of it. For the day
[1:16:33] that thou uh for in the day that thou is
[1:16:37] thereof, thou shalt surely die. Yet we
[1:16:41] know Adam lived 900 and something years
[1:16:45] for hundreds of years after that. So
[1:16:48] what died that day? Ask yourself the
[1:16:52] question. His eternal life was
[1:16:55] forfeited. That's right.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Spiritual death happened immediately.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; And the clock began to tick on his
[1:17:04] mortal body.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, time started
[1:17:12] not on the first day of creation,
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; but on the day that man fell.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; And before that, man existed in
[1:17:22] fellowship with God. And he was not
[1:17:25] bound by time
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; as we know it.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; So as we look at here, as I show you in
[1:17:31] the green, time is the measure of decay.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Mhm. So you look at yourself and your
[1:17:40] pasture three scoring 10. Well, you know
[1:17:42] how decayed you are.
[1:17:44] It's the measure of decay. You see, when
[1:17:49] that man left the tree of life, he
[1:17:53] entered a world where things age, fade,
[1:17:57] and die.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Now, as we look at this,
[1:18:04] before the fall, Adam was a son of God
[1:18:09] with no end in sight.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; His body was not created to die. It was
[1:18:16] it was housed in eternal life. And there
[1:18:20] was uh the evening and the morning and
[1:18:22] the creation days of Genesis 1. But man
[1:18:25] himself was not subject yet to the curse
[1:18:28] of time.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; So as we look here, we see Peter says
[1:18:36] one day is with the Lord as a thousand
[1:18:38] years and a thousand years is one day.
[1:18:41] So eternity is not a long time.
[1:18:45] It is a realm outside of time.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; All right. So you see when did time
[1:18:54] begin? Well for the physical universe
[1:18:58] time as a principle began in Genesis 1
[1:19:00] and1 in the beginning.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; See the beginning of measurable
[1:19:05] existence. And then two for humanity
[1:19:09] time began when Adam sinned. Amen.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; That's when death entered. That's Romans
[1:19:16] 5:12. And with it the the limitation of
[1:19:20] years, decay, separation from the
[1:19:23] timeless fellowship of God. So again, we
[1:19:27] we see this very clearly now of when
[1:19:30] time began. And let's go a little
[1:19:33] further. When will time end?
[1:19:36] Well, just as time began with the fall,
[1:19:39] it will end with the full redemption,
[1:19:42] the rapture of the bride, and ultimately
[1:19:46] usher in the eternal age.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; So, the bride returns
[1:19:53] to eternity by going beyond the veil of
[1:19:57] mortality, by the change of our body
[1:20:00] into union with Christ in the rapture.
[1:20:03] Amen.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; So you see we are here at the very time
[1:20:08] where this age blends
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; from time the time ends for us and if we
[1:20:15] blend then to eternity. So it's the it
[1:20:19] is actually the start of the king of the
[1:20:21] earth who was co-regent with God that to
[1:20:24] be exalted back to his rightful place he
[1:20:27] has to be exalted back to his rightful
[1:20:29] place because when he fell all creation
[1:20:32] fell with him. So to restore creation
[1:20:34] back you got to restore the king back
[1:20:36] first and the king is the son of Adams.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So now again the bride
[1:20:43] returns to eternity uh by going beyond
[1:20:46] the veil of mortality by the change of
[1:20:48] our body. Of course of course our souls
[1:20:52] as a segene of God we were chosen in
[1:20:54] him. I read that in Ephesians 1 before
[1:20:58] the foundational world and that means we
[1:21:00] were with him in the mind in the
[1:21:03] thoughts of God before the foundational
[1:21:05] world. And that of course gives an
[1:21:07] eternal quality to God's elect. But we
[1:21:10] are here with a a soul that uh that is
[1:21:14] from eternity and but yet a body that is
[1:21:19] captured in time
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; and time began when man lost eternal
[1:21:24] life. And it is the ticking echo of
[1:21:28] immortality, a reminder that something
[1:21:31] was lost.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; But Christ the eternal one came to
[1:21:35] restore the access back to the tree of
[1:21:38] life. And when the last member of the
[1:21:41] bride is called in, time will be no
[1:21:43] more.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; And the church ages will end, the bride
[1:21:46] is caught up into the eternals, and
[1:21:49] forever
[1:21:50] we will be with the Lord.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; What a promise that is.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; We are people going from time to
[1:21:59] eternity.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's already started by the
[1:22:03] recognition that we are were in God
[1:22:06] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:22:08] we realize now there's an eternal
[1:22:10] quality to the elect.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Right? So now time began when God's vice
[1:22:18] regent fell. You see, God created man to
[1:22:21] be in his image. He was to be the Lord
[1:22:25] over the earth, ruler, have dominion.
[1:22:28] Man was a son of eternity. Oh yeah. He
[1:22:32] was created to live in unbroken
[1:22:35] fellowship.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Think of that. He had unbroken
[1:22:39] fellowship with the eternal one. And the
[1:22:41] earth was not created for decay.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Let let me just say the earth never
[1:22:48] belong to the devil. He is only a
[1:22:51] squatter here
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; and one day he will be removed
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; completely totally thrown into the lake
[1:22:59] of fire and demolished.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So the earth was not
[1:23:04] created for decay but for beauty, for
[1:23:07] life, for communion with God's nature.
[1:23:10] So um as you see, the creation was
[1:23:13] subject to futility, not willingly, but
[1:23:16] because of him who subjected it in hope,
[1:23:19] for we know the whole creation groanth
[1:23:21] and travaleth in pain together until
[1:23:23] now. And of course, what is it longing
[1:23:25] for? The manifestation or the re
[1:23:27] revelation of the sons of God. And
[1:23:30] that's what this message is doing in
[1:23:31] this last day is revealing you as sons
[1:23:34] of God, placing you in the kingdom,
[1:23:36] giving you power and authority so that
[1:23:38] the earth can come back to its original
[1:23:40] state.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Now of course you know time as a measure
[1:23:47] of corruption, change and death entered
[1:23:49] when man fell not when the cosmos was
[1:23:52] formed. Yet, yes, the universe had
[1:23:55] motions. The sun, moon ruled the day and
[1:23:57] night, but these were not time as decay.
[1:24:00] They were markers in an eternal rhythm
[1:24:03] untainted by sin. But notice what time
[1:24:07] is. Time is a echo of death whereby as
[1:24:12] Romans 5:12 says, "Wherefore, as one man
[1:24:15] sin, by one man sin entered into the
[1:24:18] world, and by death sin, death by sin.
[1:24:21] And so death passed upon all men. So
[1:24:25] death brought separation from God. It
[1:24:28] brought corruption and corruption
[1:24:30] brought the ticking of time. And in a
[1:24:33] world without sin, time has no sting.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; You see, in a world without sin, nothing
[1:24:41] fades, nothing wither, nothing dies. But
[1:24:45] once the curse fell, everything began to
[1:24:49] run down.
[1:24:50] And we're slowly slowly ticking down the
[1:24:54] clock of time and it reaches what is
[1:24:57] called the fullness of time
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; where time reaches its fullness.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Now, so as we look at this that time is
[1:25:09] a measure of decay. A decay came with
[1:25:12] sin. Sin came because of the fall of
[1:25:14] Adam, the god of this world. Satan then
[1:25:17] became the prince of this world and took
[1:25:19] Adam's place. Luke 12 21 shows that. And
[1:25:24] the the earth fell with his steward.
[1:25:27] Adam's dominion was universal over the
[1:25:30] earth. So when he fell, everything
[1:25:32] underneath him fell. His domain fell.
[1:25:35] And now cursed is the ground for thy
[1:25:37] sake. And because of this, the whole
[1:25:39] creation groans and travails together
[1:25:43] until now until sons of God will be
[1:25:46] manifest again.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; All right? So now the whole world, the
[1:25:52] entire natural world reflects erosion,
[1:25:57] aging, death. It's a world that is
[1:26:00] caught in the web of time. It is waiting
[1:26:03] for the manifestations. That that word
[1:26:05] is apocalyptu which means the revealing
[1:26:09] of the sons of God who will bring it
[1:26:12] back to liberty again. Who will free it
[1:26:15] from the bondage of corruption. Now of
[1:26:18] course we long even for this part of the
[1:26:20] earth to be freed from the bondage of
[1:26:23] corruption.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Now when when Adam fell, Satan took the
[1:26:28] throne that Adam lost. Jesus um actually
[1:26:34] Satan told Jesus in Luke 4 and 6, all
[1:26:37] this power I will give you for that is
[1:26:39] delivered unto me. Well, who gave it to
[1:26:41] him? Adam
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; through the fall.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; You see, came subservant to him and now
[1:26:47] he becomes the ruler, prince of the
[1:26:49] power of the air. We preached a lot on
[1:26:51] it. So he and and and when that happened
[1:26:54] then Satan claimed temporary rulership
[1:26:59] and he's only doing it for a time and
[1:27:01] that's why that's why this question book
[1:27:06] is so important to get back in the hands
[1:27:08] of man because it's the title deed to
[1:27:10] the earth
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; and man lost it and it went back in the
[1:27:15] hands of God to judge and Satan makes a
[1:27:18] claim on it.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and man of course wants to
[1:27:23] claim it but he can't because he sold it
[1:27:26] to Adam I mean to to Satan right so
[1:27:29] Christ comes the second Adam
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; outside of of that and he becomes in the
[1:27:35] likeness of man and as a kinsman
[1:27:38] redeemer he redeems the book he pays the
[1:27:40] price of redemption he opens the book
[1:27:43] and he hands it back to you
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; so we are in the day we are in the bride
[1:27:49] age where the book is handed back
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; to the bride
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; to possess every promise in that book
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; and it's now not in God's hands anymore.
[1:28:03] It's not even in Christ's hands anymore.
[1:28:05] has been handed back to his bride for
[1:28:09] you to be an overcomer in this age to
[1:28:12] you to rule and reign with him now in
[1:28:15] power and dominion
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; and looking forward to the change of
[1:28:20] your mortal body where this mortal shall
[1:28:23] put on immortality and this corruption
[1:28:25] shall put on incorruption.
[1:28:27] Amen.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; So Christ the eternal one when time
[1:28:32] began to tick like a countdown waiting
[1:28:35] for the second Adam to reverse then
[1:28:38] Christ the eternal one steps into time.
[1:28:44] And Jesus the eternal word stepped into
[1:28:47] time and decay and he took on flesh. He
[1:28:52] bore our sins. He broke the curse. So
[1:28:56] the cross was the pivot point and in the
[1:29:00] rapture the church will return to
[1:29:03] timelessness,
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; the ending of time,
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; the blending of eternity. Now, we have
[1:29:12] journeyed through the seven church ages,
[1:29:15] and we're now in the bride's portion of
[1:29:17] the Leotin age, the golden age, where
[1:29:21] time doesn't stop abruptly, but it
[1:29:24] blends into eternity by beginning the
[1:29:29] end time process.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; It begins with a prophetic message that
[1:29:37] breaks the silence of his coming. That's
[1:29:40] one thing Jesus would not tell him and
[1:29:42] that was when he was coming back.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; So you know when he come to it even when
[1:29:48] he in his discourse with them and he
[1:29:50] goes to he actually covers all the seven
[1:29:53] seals and in the seventh seal he says
[1:29:55] but at that day and that hour no man
[1:29:57] knoweth.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't reveal it.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So he even writes it in
[1:30:05] symbols because he don't want them to
[1:30:08] know it.
[1:30:10] Because it's a revelation to be given in
[1:30:12] the last day
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; when it comes the bride time, bride age,
[1:30:16] marriage age, when a people of maturity
[1:30:19] comes that can handle the open book.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; That can speak the spoken word
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; that can speak to their mountains.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Now, it begins with this prophetic
[1:30:33] message that breaks the silence of his
[1:30:35] coming. It is the hour of the seventh
[1:30:38] seal. And this message produces
[1:30:43] and it the seventh from Adam.
[1:30:46] A type of you know a type of faith and
[1:30:50] walk with God that change the the bodies
[1:30:53] of the living and translate them
[1:30:54] physically from time into eternity. For
[1:30:57] the living resurrected bride time will
[1:31:00] be no more. Now I want to go through
[1:31:02] this. If you notice in Revelation 8:1,
[1:31:06] "And when he had opened the seventh
[1:31:08] seal, there was silence in heaven about
[1:31:10] the space of a half an hour." So, I want
[1:31:12] you to get a a picture. Something was
[1:31:14] silenced and it was for a time.
[1:31:19] Now, in the span of eternity is a very
[1:31:22] short time
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; because it's symbolized by a half an
[1:31:28] hour of silence.
[1:31:32] And listen now, brother Brandon said,
[1:31:34] "We heard the word say this message
[1:31:36] shalom. In the days of the seventh angel
[1:31:39] in the church age, he just said the
[1:31:40] seventh angel's message would be the
[1:31:42] last message." And all we find here in
[1:31:44] Revelation 10, in the days of the
[1:31:46] message of the seventh angel, the
[1:31:48] mysteries of God should be finished. The
[1:31:49] seventh seal would be pulled back.
[1:31:55] It should be there. And then all at once
[1:31:58] when it's happening
[1:32:02] a vision broke said go to Tucson a great
[1:32:06] noise will take place at this time so
[1:32:08] you'll be thoroughly understanding and
[1:32:10] know that it's sent it'll just shake the
[1:32:11] earth nearly and all of you know about
[1:32:13] it it's on tape months before it
[1:32:14] happened then it happened. It appeared
[1:32:16] in the sky. Shalom. What is it? It's the
[1:32:19] changing beats. It's the symphony.
[1:32:23] So the sheet music has now changed and
[1:32:28] the beat of the music is now changed
[1:32:31] from the denominational ages until where
[1:32:34] there's a bride marching in unison with
[1:32:37] the word.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; And look what happened in the days of
[1:32:42] this message. It was the seventh seal or
[1:32:45] the breaking of the silence, the opening
[1:32:47] of the silence. You see that was pulled
[1:32:51] back and then while it is happening
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; while it is now not when the prophets
[1:32:59] revealing it not when he's preaching on
[1:33:02] the seventh seal but while it's
[1:33:04] happening it happens with seven angels
[1:33:08] breaking through the dimensions of
[1:33:09] eternity into time and bringing a
[1:33:13] message that the time of delay to hold
[1:33:16] this silence back that is mysteries back
[1:33:19] is now the hour of revelation.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; It's now for you to know you are in the
[1:33:27] cycle of his coming.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; You are the people of the rapture.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; You're the rapture age.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; So now looking at this, I want to get
[1:33:42] something clear to you and and that is
[1:33:44] the seventh seal is not a singular
[1:33:47] event. I want you to watch. We must
[1:33:49] remember this seventh seal is the end of
[1:33:51] time of all things. How many remembers?
[1:33:54] Now we're talking about time ending, the
[1:33:56] blending ending of time, the blending of
[1:33:58] eternity.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; So watch this. Um the things written in
[1:34:03] the seven sealed book sealed at the plan
[1:34:05] of redemption from the before the
[1:34:07] foundation of the world. If every bit
[1:34:09] ends, it is the end. Is the end of the
[1:34:11] struggling world. Is the end of
[1:34:12] struggling nature. Is the end of
[1:34:14] everything. It's the end of the
[1:34:15] trumpets. the end of the viles to the
[1:34:16] end of the earth. It's even the end of
[1:34:18] time. Times runs out. The Bible said so.
[1:34:20] Revelation 10 1-7 verse 7th verse. And
[1:34:24] time runs out. The angel said time will
[1:34:26] be no more when that in the days of this
[1:34:29] great thing to happen. Everything runs
[1:34:31] out in this time at the end of this
[1:34:34] seventh seal. So this seventh seal, the
[1:34:38] breaking of the silence is the changing
[1:34:42] of the beat. It is a new page. is the
[1:34:45] turning of the page in the symphony
[1:34:48] where that we come back to bride time,
[1:34:51] bride age and it is bringing now about
[1:34:54] the end the climax of the end time
[1:34:58] events.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Now watch this carefully as we go along
[1:35:03] because this will get clear as you as
[1:35:05] you go. Notice it is the end of the
[1:35:07] church age. So the seventh seal will
[1:35:11] bring about the end of the church age
[1:35:13] because it is the coming of the Lord and
[1:35:15] with the rapture the church age ends. It
[1:35:18] is the end of the seven seals of course
[1:35:20] it's the seventh one. It is the end of
[1:35:22] the trumpets that's happens in the
[1:35:24] tribulation. It's the end of the vows
[1:35:26] tribulation even ends usher in the
[1:35:28] millennium other side the tribulation
[1:35:30] after the battle of Armageddon that's
[1:35:32] all on the seventh seal. It's like
[1:35:34] firing a rocket in the air and that
[1:35:35] rocket explodes here and goes up and
[1:35:37] explodes again. It puts out five stars
[1:35:39] and those five stars expose and blows
[1:35:41] out five stars from it. And then one of
[1:35:43] them stars expose and blows out five
[1:35:45] stars from it. It fades on out. That's
[1:35:47] what this seventh seal. It just ends the
[1:35:49] time for the world. It ends the time for
[1:35:50] this. It means the time for that. Uh it
[1:35:53] ends the time for this. It means ends
[1:35:54] the time everything is just ended up on
[1:35:58] that seventh seal.
[1:36:00] So the seventh seal
[1:36:03] begins
[1:36:05] with the breaking of the silence
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; of his coming
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; and sets in motion the things that the
[1:36:16] spirit in the spiritual realm and then
[1:36:19] that will affect the physical realm and
[1:36:22] everything will start winding up
[1:36:25] finishing up. So now it is the divine
[1:36:29] trigger that sets in motion a chain
[1:36:33] reaction.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; It's like the ignition of a rocket who
[1:36:39] stages fire one after another until the
[1:36:41] mission is complete.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; And when the silence of the seventh seal
[1:36:46] is broken, the end time process begins.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; It first with the sinning of a prophet.
[1:36:54] I want you to understand
[1:36:57] the the prophet is a sign. It is a birth
[1:37:01] pain.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; It is the world in travail to bring
[1:37:06] forth first a bride.
[1:37:10] Come on.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; And then secondly the earth back to its
[1:37:15] original condition. Amen.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; So you see it is it is a it is the birth
[1:37:21] pain and he comes out as a prophet comes
[1:37:24] delivering the final message. He reveals
[1:37:27] the mysteries of God. He restores the
[1:37:29] law the truths lost to the ages. This
[1:37:32] message matures the bride to full word
[1:37:37] stature
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; preparing her for the rapture. And with
[1:37:42] her departure, the fullness of the
[1:37:44] Gentiles is complete and the church age
[1:37:48] closes. The gospel turns to the Israel
[1:37:51] in revealing the Messiah to the 144,000
[1:37:54] with the seven trumpets. The calling
[1:37:57] Israel back to the true atonement,
[1:37:59] especially the seventh one, which is
[1:38:01] same to them as our seventh seal is the
[1:38:03] coming of the Messiah to them. As the
[1:38:05] chain reaction continues to unfold, the
[1:38:08] vials bring judgment to the earth.
[1:38:10] Babylon falls. Christ returns with his
[1:38:13] bride. The millennium's ushered in. The
[1:38:15] seventh seal when it's open. It is the
[1:38:18] unfolding of God's entire in entire end
[1:38:22] time program until time itself is no
[1:38:26] more.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; That's where we're at.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; We're the people of the seventh seal.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; We're the people of the coming. the
[1:38:39] bride he's coming for.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; So we are now in the dispensation
[1:38:45] of the fullness of time. Now that word
[1:38:48] dispensation as you can see is economia
[1:38:51] in the Greek where we get our word
[1:38:53] economy from.
[1:38:55] So it literally means administration,
[1:38:58] stewardship or plan of management. So it
[1:39:00] is administration
[1:39:02] of the end of the fullness of time. So
[1:39:05] time now is going to we're coming into a
[1:39:09] economy into a new page on the symphony
[1:39:12] into a new beat. We're now coming into a
[1:39:16] a change right here in there. It's a
[1:39:19] dispensation
[1:39:20] of where time will come to its fullness.
[1:39:23] Now this is not a vague idea. Paul is
[1:39:26] speaking of God's specific appointed
[1:39:29] arrangement for bringing his plan to
[1:39:31] conclusion.
[1:39:33] And just as there are dispensation or
[1:39:35] stages in God's dealing with mankind
[1:39:37] such as law, grace, kingdom, age, all
[1:39:40] these you see the dispensation of the
[1:39:42] fullness time is the final phase where
[1:39:45] everything God has purposed is brought
[1:39:48] into perfect order unto Christ. So it's
[1:39:51] where h something begins
[1:39:54] that is issued in that starts a cycle of
[1:39:58] events that winds up bringing everything
[1:40:03] that God has purposed into perfect order
[1:40:06] under the headship of Christ.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; So this is what God is doing. Now as we
[1:40:14] look here
[1:40:16] it just as dispensations
[1:40:18] are stages in God's dealing with mankind
[1:40:22] law and grace. So everything is brought
[1:40:24] into perfect unity. Now let's look at
[1:40:27] the next thing which is the fullness of
[1:40:29] time. Now I'm not sure I can pronounce
[1:40:32] all these Greek words but you know it
[1:40:35] means the one means fullness,
[1:40:37] completion, maturity, rightness. So
[1:40:40] maturity of times
[1:40:43] uh completion of times right of times
[1:40:48] kario which is appointed seasons not
[1:40:50] just chronological time but God's
[1:40:52] ordained moment that means with with
[1:40:55] when every appointed season in God's
[1:40:57] timetable has reached its full maturity
[1:41:00] and nothing remains unfinished
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; all prophecy all types all promises
[1:41:08] complete and fulfilled
[1:41:11] Now, of course, we are in the time where
[1:41:15] God's fulfilling all types promises and
[1:41:18] prophecies concerning the bride.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; But one day, the earth will also come to
[1:41:24] that place where it'll be cleansed from
[1:41:27] sin, where a new Jerusalem will sit down
[1:41:30] on it. First, it'll be burned with fire
[1:41:32] and renewed again with a holy fire and
[1:41:35] God will come and dwell. You know the
[1:41:37] same stages that he does with you of
[1:41:40] justification, sanctification, baptism
[1:41:43] of the Holy Ghost is the same thing he
[1:41:45] does with the earth. You know, he
[1:41:47] baptized in water in Noah's day. He he
[1:41:50] shed his blood upon and sanctified it in
[1:41:53] Jesus day. And then this last day um he
[1:41:57] will take and burn it with fire. And of
[1:41:59] course that's a temporary judgment. will
[1:42:01] walk out on the ashes of the wicked and
[1:42:03] ultimately will point to where all sin
[1:42:05] is cleansed and everything and God's
[1:42:07] holy fire and God himself will come and
[1:42:09] dwell on the earth.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; What a day that will be.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; So it begins
[1:42:15] with the breaking of the time of silence
[1:42:18] concerning his coming. The thing that
[1:42:21] God wouldn't let anybody know
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; when they asked him there as he was
[1:42:25] going away, will you at this time
[1:42:26] restore the kingdom of Israel for the
[1:42:28] times and season? It's not for you to
[1:42:30] know,
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; but this is what you are to know of this
[1:42:33] coming. I'm going to point you to the
[1:42:34] right coming that you are to look for.
[1:42:36] You shall receive power after the Holy
[1:42:38] Ghost has come on you.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; So if you don't make that coming, you're
[1:42:41] not going to make the other.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; So it begins with the breaking of the s
[1:42:46] time of silence concerning his coming.
[1:42:48] The breaking of the silence comes with
[1:42:50] God's voice thundering out uncovering
[1:42:53] the mysteries of the seven seals. And
[1:42:56] this opens the book as revealed to Paul.
[1:42:59] The firing of this rocket brings about
[1:43:01] another fulfillment, the complete
[1:43:03] maturity and perfection of the bride,
[1:43:06] making a church without spot or wrinkle
[1:43:08] or blemish or any such thing. This
[1:43:12] causes the bride to move from time into
[1:43:16] eternity. And it brings about the
[1:43:19] fullness of the Gentiles. And from then
[1:43:21] on under this dispensation of bringing
[1:43:24] all things under harvest maturity event
[1:43:27] starts winding up for the church for
[1:43:29] Israel for the reign of mystery Babylon
[1:43:32] comes to an end. The world is burned is
[1:43:34] renovated for the millennium time for
[1:43:37] all things is wound up and brought to
[1:43:40] its fullness and ultimately it's the
[1:43:42] final uniting of the heavenly bridegroom
[1:43:45] with his bride. the new Jerusalem
[1:43:46] descend into course, the curse removed,
[1:43:49] and God's will done perfectly on earth
[1:43:52] as it is in heaven. Something we were
[1:43:55] told to pray about. So, the dispensation
[1:43:59] of the fullness of time, it connects to
[1:44:02] other scriptures. Let's see if I have
[1:44:04] this. Okay. So it it it connects to um
[1:44:09] you know the fullness of the Gentiles or
[1:44:12] you know the fullness of time when he
[1:44:14] said it when in the in the fullness of
[1:44:17] time God sent forth his son for his
[1:44:19] first coming his first advent. So
[1:44:22] likewise time reaches its fullness when
[1:44:25] he comes the second time. And so then
[1:44:27] Paul also reveals a time that's way out
[1:44:31] in the future, way out in the eternals
[1:44:35] where that he describes the end where
[1:44:37] Christ will actually deliver up the
[1:44:40] kingdom to the father having put down
[1:44:42] all rule and authority and that will
[1:44:45] then finalize the dispensation of the
[1:44:48] fullness of time. So that's when of
[1:44:51] course God becomes all in all and that
[1:44:54] simply means redemption is now over
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; complete
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; because man is redeemed. All mankind is
[1:45:02] saved that is going to be saved. The
[1:45:04] rest are cast in the lake of fire
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; and then of course of course the earth
[1:45:09] is then redeemed and of course then then
[1:45:13] God becomes all in all. In other words,
[1:45:15] it's not that Jesus is no more relevant.
[1:45:18] is just that his office of redeemer is
[1:45:21] now complete
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; and he's he steps now from being kinsman
[1:45:30] redeemer to being all in all
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; now. So now we're going to look back at
[1:45:38] this quotation. Are you tired yet? All
[1:45:42] right, I'm doing pretty good on time.
[1:45:45] So here we go.
[1:45:47] So, we're going to look at this future
[1:45:48] to home in in Ephesians 1:10. He's
[1:45:53] called is, if you're putting it down,
[1:45:54] Ephesians 1:10. It's not called a
[1:45:56] dispensation, not the seventh day. It's
[1:45:59] called the fullness of time. When the
[1:46:01] fullness of time has come, that when
[1:46:03] time has been fulfilled, when there's no
[1:46:05] more time, you go, then you go into
[1:46:08] eternity. After the seven church age is
[1:46:09] over, Anodas Luther's age is over,
[1:46:12] Methodist age is over, Pentecostal age
[1:46:14] is over, and now you go into what?
[1:46:15] Eternity? No more sevens, no more no
[1:46:18] more threes, no more other there in
[1:46:20] eternity where there's no much such
[1:46:22] thing as times, numbers,
[1:46:25] and things. All right.
[1:46:28] So, Brother Brandham is using in this
[1:46:31] sermon some powerful typology
[1:46:33] to show the end of time as we know it
[1:46:36] and the ushering in of eternity. And he
[1:46:40] says, "When there's no more time, then
[1:46:43] you go into eternity after the seventh
[1:46:46] church age is over." And it is. Now, at
[1:46:49] first glance, this sounds like he's
[1:46:51] declaring the seventh church age,
[1:46:53] Leodysa, is over. But you read
[1:46:56] carefully, he is speaking prophetically
[1:46:59] about the end result of God's redemptive
[1:47:02] timeline, not current, not the current
[1:47:06] chronological status. So men are
[1:47:09] misplacing this quote, using it to mean
[1:47:11] that the bride has already left the
[1:47:13] church ages, has been caught up in the
[1:47:15] ages already in eternity. But I want you
[1:47:17] to see he's describing the future
[1:47:20] eternal day.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; What the Bible calls the fullness of
[1:47:24] time. This is not the seventh day
[1:47:28] millennial reign. The millennium is a
[1:47:30] thousand years long.
[1:47:33] And during it, the earth is still in
[1:47:35] time.
[1:47:38] All right. And the millennium is the
[1:47:41] seventh day in God's redemptive week.
[1:47:44] But after the church ages is over, past
[1:47:47] Luther's age, past the Methodist age,
[1:47:50] past the Pentecostal age, past the
[1:47:52] Leodysian age, even past the millennium
[1:47:55] itself, time will fully finally fully
[1:47:59] reach its end.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; All right. When the millennium closes,
[1:48:06] the earth moves into eternity, which the
[1:48:09] scripture sometimes calls the eighth
[1:48:12] day.
[1:48:13] Yet, it's not a literal eighth day.
[1:48:17] It's just time repeated,
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; you know, or or I meant I meant to say
[1:48:22] it's not a literal eighth day, just as
[1:48:25] if time is repeated. But it's God's
[1:48:27] redemptive week. It only has seven days.
[1:48:31] And when they're fulfilled, there'll be
[1:48:33] no more cycle of time to turn over.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; The eth day is symbolic. It means a new
[1:48:38] beginning
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; beyond the boundaries of time.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; It is a day when time shall be no more.
[1:48:46] when creation steps in one great
[1:48:50] unending eternal day and where the ages
[1:48:54] are complete, when time has ceased and
[1:48:56] God's redeemed dwell in a timeless glory
[1:48:59] of the new heavens and the new earth.
[1:49:02] Now notice the next paragraph.
[1:49:06] And now you
[1:49:09] now you you go or or excuse me, I want
[1:49:11] to back this up. You see this last
[1:49:15] sentence here? And Now you go into what?
[1:49:17] Eternity.
[1:49:19] No more threes, no more other. There
[1:49:22] eternity where there's no such thing as
[1:49:23] numbers and times and things. And you
[1:49:25] think, what is he talking about? Well,
[1:49:28] in his sermon, he has emphasized that
[1:49:31] there are threes in God's numerology.
[1:49:35] Three steps to the birth. Water, blood,
[1:49:37] and spirit. Justification,
[1:49:38] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:49:40] Ghost. There are sevens such as seven
[1:49:43] church ages and seven seals and seven
[1:49:46] vows, seven trumpets. But when the
[1:49:49] eternal day dawns, there's no such thing
[1:49:52] as time, months, days or weeks. There
[1:49:56] will be no new births in three stages.
[1:50:00] Redemption is over.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; There will be no number of ages. So no
[1:50:04] more sevens. Time is over.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; All right. So when there's no more time
[1:50:14] then you go into eternity.
[1:50:18] Notice when there's no more time then
[1:50:21] you go into eternity.
[1:50:24] And we saw that when after the seventh
[1:50:28] church age is over and it is when what
[1:50:32] did he say? when you go into eternity.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Which will be after the ages are over,
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; after the Pentecostal age is over. The
[1:50:44] method is that all the ages are over and
[1:50:47] we're through with numbers and time.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; We go into eternity.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:50:55] so there there will be time no more. Now
[1:50:59] it's now the eternals
[1:51:03] in the when when this happened is now
[1:51:06] the eternals in the heaven and the new
[1:51:09] heavens and the earth. So in the next
[1:51:11] verse or shall I call it paragraph he
[1:51:14] says or after time has been fulfilled.
[1:51:18] So now he's still talking about the same
[1:51:20] thing after time has been fulfilled all
[1:51:22] sin is gone taken away at the millennium
[1:51:26] at the great white throne judgment. He's
[1:51:28] going through all of these sequence of
[1:51:29] events. A tied by the Holy Ghost after
[1:51:32] the world is on fire and baptized. It's
[1:51:34] baptism of holy fire from heaven. All
[1:51:36] sin is gone. All germs is gone. All
[1:51:37] devils is gone. All imp temptation gone.
[1:51:40] All evil is gone type. Now then what
[1:51:42] does God do? He can sit on the earth
[1:51:43] because all sin
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; is gone.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; So here's the key. He's not placing us
[1:51:49] beyond Leodysian time. He's looking
[1:51:51] ahead to when time itself ends after the
[1:51:54] millennium, the great white throne, the
[1:51:56] purging of the earth by fire. That's
[1:51:59] when the fullness of times, Ephesians
[1:52:01] 1:10, comes in. Time is over. When the
[1:52:03] earth enters into the eternal day after
[1:52:06] the millennium now, of course, we reach
[1:52:08] fullness of time when we are changed in
[1:52:10] a moment, twinkling of an eye.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; But the earth goes on in time. And so it
[1:52:14] is after sin, death, temptation, the
[1:52:17] curse is entirely removed. Not just
[1:52:20] merely spiritually but literally and
[1:52:22] finally. So it means what he means is
[1:52:26] that each of the denominational ages
[1:52:29] Luther Wesley Pentecost they've all
[1:52:32] served their purpose.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Those systems have run out.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; The organized movements are no more
[1:52:38] valid as channels of truth. They are
[1:52:41] over in time in the terms of God's use
[1:52:44] of them. But the leodysian time period
[1:52:47] remains until the rapture removes the
[1:52:51] bride and ends the age. So as we look at
[1:52:54] it is this call is a spiritual call to
[1:52:59] come out of leodysian condition
[1:53:01] lukewarmness self-righteousness
[1:53:03] blindness man-made tradition the
[1:53:06] physical rapture the only true exit from
[1:53:09] Leodysian age itself. Now, so now the
[1:53:14] bride of course is called out of the
[1:53:16] Leodysian condition, not out of the
[1:53:18] Leodysian age. The Leodysian age is the
[1:53:22] last. There is no eighth age. When
[1:53:25] brother Brandon says the church age is
[1:53:27] over, he's prophetically speaking of the
[1:53:29] end of denominational system looking
[1:53:31] ahead to the consummation of time. The
[1:53:34] bride remains on the earth in the
[1:53:35] Leodysian time period until the rapture
[1:53:38] takes her physically out. The term
[1:53:40] fullness of time, Ephesians 1:10, refers
[1:53:43] to the entrance into eternity after the
[1:53:45] millennium and the final judgment when
[1:53:48] time as a measure ceases and God
[1:53:52] tabernacles on a purified earth.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a day that will be.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; So what did he mean in the future home?
[1:54:01] He was speaking prophetically,
[1:54:02] positionally, looking to the completion
[1:54:04] of God's redemptive timeline, including
[1:54:06] church age, the rapture, tribulation,
[1:54:09] ending with the battle of Armageddon,
[1:54:10] the millennium, the seventh day, the
[1:54:12] white throne judgment, the final purging
[1:54:14] of the earth, the entrance of the into
[1:54:16] eternity, the eighth day. And when he
[1:54:18] says after the seventh church age is
[1:54:20] over and it is, he's speaking from the
[1:54:22] viewpoint of the finished work, the
[1:54:26] eternal day where in time where time and
[1:54:28] prophetic purpose is fulfilled and no
[1:54:30] longer measured by sevens or threes, but
[1:54:33] positionally and experience
[1:54:34] experientially at this moment we are
[1:54:37] still in the Leodysian age. And it's
[1:54:40] important that we understand that.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you you see the age will soon
[1:54:47] end by translation. Now, so several
[1:54:51] weeks later, if you um in August of
[1:54:57] 1964, he preaches on the future home
[1:54:59] that we've been reading from. And then
[1:55:02] in question answers at the end of
[1:55:03] August, he is being asked questions. And
[1:55:07] somebody
[1:55:09] has caught this statement and maybe
[1:55:13] people have already began to run with
[1:55:15] it. we've already left the age.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; And so they ask him a question. Brother
[1:55:21] Brandham, have you made statements
[1:55:23] recently?
[1:55:25] And it would have to be back future
[1:55:28] home.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; You know that the church ages has ended
[1:55:32] Leodysia. And he said, "No, I never said
[1:55:35] it's ended. If I did, you misunderstood
[1:55:40] or I said it wrong. This is the last
[1:55:44] church age. It is the end of the church
[1:55:47] ages. The le oysia. It hasn't ended.
[1:55:51] When it ends, the church is gone. So
[1:55:53] long as the church is here, it hasn't
[1:55:56] ended.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Now, so as we look at this, brother
[1:56:02] Brandham, have you made statements
[1:56:04] recently? No. I never said it's ended.
[1:56:08] If I did, you misunderstood or I said it
[1:56:10] wrong.
[1:56:12] This is the last church age. It's the
[1:56:14] end of the church ages. The lay of the
[1:56:16] age. It hadn't ended. When it ends, the
[1:56:19] church is gone. As long as the church is
[1:56:21] here, it hasn't ended.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Now, so here the key point is the age
[1:56:30] has reached its last phase, but it
[1:56:32] hasn't ended. Why? Because the bride
[1:56:34] hadn't been taken in a rapture.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; The end of the age comes with the
[1:56:38] departure of the bride, not before. Now
[1:56:40] I want to go here some key points. The
[1:56:43] church age continues to the rapture. The
[1:56:45] bride is called out spiritually, yes,
[1:56:47] but not physically removed until the
[1:56:49] rapture. The tribulation does not begin
[1:56:51] until the bride is gone. After that, the
[1:56:54] seventh day, the millennial reign. Then
[1:56:55] comes the eighth and eternal day with
[1:56:57] the new heavens and the new earth. So
[1:57:00] where are we at now? We're living in the
[1:57:02] final moments of the Leodysian age. The
[1:57:04] bride is being called out of Leodysian
[1:57:06] lukewarmness. She's no part of its
[1:57:08] system. and and uh spirit of Leodysia.
[1:57:11] She's still present in the age, awaiting
[1:57:13] her change. Only the rapture will end
[1:57:15] the age for her. Until then, she walks
[1:57:17] in the light of the revealed word.
[1:57:18] Separated in spirit, but not yet
[1:57:20] separated in time.
[1:57:23] So, we look at the conclusion. What did
[1:57:25] brother Brandham not say? What brother
[1:57:27] Brandham did not say? That the Leodysian
[1:57:30] age is over. That the bride's no longer
[1:57:32] in the seventh age, and that we've
[1:57:33] entered into another age.
[1:57:36] what he did say. We are presently living
[1:57:39] in the final age. Leodysia, the bride's
[1:57:41] called out of Leodysia condition. The
[1:57:42] age will only end when the bride is
[1:57:44] raptured. The tribulation begins after
[1:57:46] her departure and the age goes into
[1:57:48] chaos. Then the end of the church ages
[1:57:50] as referenced in the future home speaks
[1:57:52] of the consummation of all things and
[1:57:54] interest in eternity, not the present
[1:57:57] moment.
[1:57:59] So
[1:58:01] as we look at this
[1:58:04] in the sermon, brother Brandham actually
[1:58:08] talks about the great city.
[1:58:12] And
[1:58:14] you know, how can an artist really pick
[1:58:18] out what it really looks like? It's got
[1:58:19] gates of pearls, 12 gates. Brother
[1:58:23] Brandham said, "It's a pyramid-like
[1:58:25] mountain. Christ is the light.
[1:58:28] You know, it's it it's a prepared city
[1:58:32] for prepared people. But brother
[1:58:35] Brandham draws an illustration on the
[1:58:37] blackboard and he talks about the
[1:58:39] length, breadth, and height. And he's
[1:58:41] really just talking about the the new
[1:58:43] Jerusalem will not be a cube. It would
[1:58:46] be like a pyramid. In fact, he calls it
[1:58:49] my holy mountain. So it'll be pyramid
[1:58:52] shape as a city comes up and it and it
[1:58:55] goes up as we have it showed and no
[1:58:58] notice um uh the pyramid he said there's
[1:59:02] another measure besides a cube that that
[1:59:05] proves it and and and he says this being
[1:59:09] this way would answer exactly to Enoch's
[1:59:11] sign in Egypt the pyramid now it is said
[1:59:16] that Enoch built the pyramid now there's
[1:59:19] arguments among people about that and so
[1:59:21] on like that. But you know again uh
[1:59:26] there was in the great pyramid it was
[1:59:28] not a barrel tomb. There was no body
[1:59:31] ever found in it.
[1:59:34] It was it was a temple
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; and it was a structure that was built
[1:59:40] and the word pyramid actually in
[1:59:42] Egyptian means the place of ascension.
[1:59:47] And as brother Brandham said, it was
[1:59:49] never capped. And because it speaks of a
[1:59:53] future time where the capstone is coming
[1:59:56] and when the capstone is come, the bride
[1:59:58] will be complete. It'll be time for the
[2:00:00] ascension. So if you're looking at this
[2:00:03] sign, the pyramid in it before the
[2:00:06] analytia and destruction when
[2:00:08] justification was coming in, he brought
[2:00:10] forth the sign and this pyramid is seven
[2:00:12] steps.
[2:00:14] In this pyramid is seven steps going to
[2:00:16] the king's chamber. Watch on the seventh
[2:00:19] step. If you ever study the dimensions
[2:00:21] of the pyramid, what comes out to take
[2:00:23] the oncomer to introduce the king, watch
[2:00:26] those stations that are standing there
[2:00:28] and you'll see the day you're living in
[2:00:31] the pyramid.
[2:00:33] So he says the pyramid has seven steps
[2:00:37] and on the seventh step
[2:00:39] then there is someone that comes out to
[2:00:44] introduce you to the king on the seventh
[2:00:47] step.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Now watch and he says you watch those
[2:00:51] stations of these steps and you'll see
[2:00:55] the day you're living in in the pyramid.
[2:00:58] Now watch watch as he says it.
[2:01:02] And notice how beautiful in this pyramid
[2:01:05] with seven steps, then the king's
[2:01:07] chamber and we're in the seventh church
[2:01:11] age before the king takes his throne.
[2:01:14] And remember, the pyramid never had a
[2:01:17] capstone on it. And the capstone we know
[2:01:20] is coming crying grace, grace.
[2:01:24] So I want you to see as he sums up his
[2:01:28] sermon past these other statements, he
[2:01:31] declares, "We are in the seventh church
[2:01:35] age
[2:01:36] before the king takes the throne.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; We are here now in the place of
[2:01:45] ascension,
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; the rapture age, rapture hour."
[2:01:52] Isn't that beautiful?
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Now, notice
[2:01:56] as as I want to I want to take just a
[2:01:59] moment on this because I still got some
[2:02:01] time. We have um the the pyramid. The
[2:02:06] pyramid
[2:02:09] doesn't actually have seven steps up to
[2:02:12] the king's chamber as you envision it
[2:02:14] like seven steps. But the Grand Galley
[2:02:17] walls are built using seven corballed
[2:02:20] courses each progressively pro
[2:02:23] projecting inward creating a narrowing
[2:02:27] effect as you ascend. However, these are
[2:02:29] not individual steps in the traditional
[2:02:32] sense but like more like the series of
[2:02:34] ledges that contribute to the overall
[2:02:37] structure of the gallery. The king's
[2:02:40] chamber itself doesn't have a stairway
[2:02:42] staircase with seven steps directly
[2:02:45] leading to it. So but however there are
[2:02:49] seven corbals as it's called you know or
[2:02:52] stations as brother Benham called. He
[2:02:54] says you come up the seventh one and
[2:02:56] that's where that the messenger comes
[2:03:00] out to greet the oncomer to introduce
[2:03:04] and usher him into the presence of the
[2:03:07] king. And that's where we're at in the
[2:03:09] seventh age where we're being ushered
[2:03:12] into the presence of the king.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. What a promise that
[2:03:18] is. Now the question goes on and brother
[2:03:21] Brand says, "Oh, the church age is
[2:03:24] ending and is backed out and the bride's
[2:03:26] called and we've already entered into
[2:03:27] the tribulation period." No, no, no, no.
[2:03:31] You're I wish I could just have more
[2:03:33] time on that. The bride when she's taken
[2:03:34] from the church, the church age will
[2:03:36] cease. Leodysia goes into chaos. The
[2:03:38] bride goes to glory. The tribulation
[2:03:41] period sets in upon the sleeping virgin
[2:03:43] for three and a half years while Israel
[2:03:44] is getting his prophecy. Then the
[2:03:46] tribulation sets in upon Israel. And
[2:03:48] when then comes the battle of Armageddon
[2:03:51] which destroys all things. And then the
[2:03:52] bride returns back with the groom for a
[2:03:54] thousand years, the millennial reign.
[2:03:56] And after comes that comes the white
[2:03:58] throne judgment. After that comes the
[2:03:59] new heavens and new earth, the new city
[2:04:01] coming down from God out of heaven.
[2:04:03] Eternity and time blends together.
[2:04:08] So, let's break that down.
[2:04:11] The church age continues to the rapture.
[2:04:15] The bride, when she's taken from the
[2:04:18] church, then the church age will cease.
[2:04:21] The church age is not over yet. It ends
[2:04:25] only when the bride is raptured, taken
[2:04:27] physically from the earth. As long as
[2:04:29] the bride is here, we're still in the
[2:04:30] Leodysian age. After the rapture,
[2:04:34] Leodysia falls into chaos. Leoticia, as
[2:04:37] brother Brandham said, goes into chaos.
[2:04:39] The bride goes to glory. After the bride
[2:04:41] is removed, the remaining church system
[2:04:43] Leodysia descends into confusion and
[2:04:45] judgment. This is the false sleeping
[2:04:48] church. The foolish virgin left behind.
[2:04:51] This is the absence. The absence of the
[2:04:53] bride's influence leaves Leodysia
[2:04:56] spiritually bankrupt and vulnerable. And
[2:04:59] the gentile dispensation ends. Here's
[2:05:02] the key point. The spiritual life leaves
[2:05:04] with the bride and what remains is
[2:05:07] subject to strong delusion and judgment.
[2:05:10] And that all happens in the tribulation
[2:05:13] period.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:05:17] let's carry this
[2:05:20] one more.
[2:05:22] Okay.
[2:05:25] So now we look at this and we see the
[2:05:29] tribulation
[2:05:31] begins after the rapture.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Now notice, remember, he's going to
[2:05:38] separate the chaff
[2:05:41] from the wheat, and that which is left
[2:05:44] behind will be burned with unquenchable
[2:05:46] fire.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Now, some may be sent into judgment on
[2:05:50] to hell. I'm not going to even argue
[2:05:51] that point, but they're going to go into
[2:05:54] the fire of tribulation
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; for further purging. I'll tell you this,
[2:05:59] you don't want to be left behind.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; So, the tribulation have begins after
[2:06:04] the rapture and the and the tribulation
[2:06:06] period sets in upon the sleeping virgin
[2:06:08] for three and a half years. So,
[2:06:10] tribulation does not begin until the
[2:06:11] bride is gone. These three and a half
[2:06:14] years affect the gentile world and the
[2:06:16] foolish virgins. Those who missed the
[2:06:19] call but were not hostile to the truth.
[2:06:22] They must face purification through
[2:06:25] suffering. The Bible said they will wash
[2:06:27] their robes in the blood of the lamb and
[2:06:29] make them white. They had already done
[2:06:32] works of sanctification
[2:06:34] and they got to go because they did not
[2:06:36] receive the fullness of the spirit and
[2:06:38] they rejected the word which was their
[2:06:40] atonement, the full atonement. Then they
[2:06:43] got to go into tribulation for further
[2:06:45] purging. You don't go into tribulation
[2:06:48] for further purging because you have
[2:06:50] been accounted worthy to stand before
[2:06:52] the son of man, the word of God, and be
[2:06:54] judged now and separated the chap from
[2:06:57] your life. And you go into the rapture,
[2:07:00] escaping the judgment. But then comes
[2:07:02] the seventh day, the millennium, and
[2:07:04] then the judgment. And after that, the
[2:07:07] eighth day of eternity dawn.
[2:07:11] Now
[2:07:12] then the tribulation turns toward Israel
[2:07:16] while Israel is getting his prophecy.
[2:07:19] The seventh trumpet sounds to them which
[2:07:22] is the revealing of their Messiah. The
[2:07:26] revealing of the coming of Christ to
[2:07:27] them just like our seventh seal is the
[2:07:29] revealing of Christ to us the word. Then
[2:07:33] here when their trumpet sounds and they
[2:07:36] are called from from the atonement of uh
[2:07:40] you know people are talking about well
[2:07:42] they're going to sacrifice red heers you
[2:07:44] know all the red heers in the world will
[2:07:46] not take away sin.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The blood of bulls and goats could
[2:07:52] never take away sin.
[2:07:55] So they're going to by their prophets be
[2:07:58] taken and shown what the true atonement
[2:08:01] is
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; and that was Jesus Christ
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; and that will be revealed by the by
[2:08:09] Moses and Elijah which by the way it
[2:08:11] represents the fullness of law Moses and
[2:08:14] prophets. So the whole Old Testament
[2:08:17] encapsulated into a ministry, two
[2:08:20] witnesses that will go forth and they
[2:08:23] will do what? They will they will
[2:08:25] literally turn their hearts there to
[2:08:29] receive the son Jesus Christ. So you see
[2:08:33] what they will do in this Israel gets
[2:08:36] his prophecy and the tribulation which
[2:08:39] is also called the times of Jacob's
[2:08:42] trouble sets in upon Israel. During the
[2:08:45] tribulation, God begins dealing with
[2:08:47] Israel as prophesied in Daniel 9:27.
[2:08:51] And and the great tribulation lasts
[2:08:54] three and a half years. Focuses heavily
[2:08:56] on Israel's purging and preparation for
[2:08:59] the me messianic return, the Messiah
[2:09:02] return. Now, we believe that already
[2:09:07] that the first half of the 70th week has
[2:09:11] been fulfilled.
[2:09:14] and it was fulfilled in Christ's
[2:09:15] ministry and he was the sacrifice that
[2:09:18] was cut off. Then came the times of the
[2:09:20] gentile and the times of Israel will
[2:09:23] pick up again with the revealing of the
[2:09:26] atonement to the Jews.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Now actually these prophets do the same
[2:09:32] thing as our prophet did to us and that
[2:09:34] was to what? Return us back to the
[2:09:37] original atonement. bringing back the
[2:09:40] original new birth, the coming of the
[2:09:42] Holy Spirit, not a portion, but all of
[2:09:44] the word in power. And so again, when
[2:09:47] you look at this, you're seeing Israel
[2:09:49] getting his prophecy tribulation period.
[2:09:52] God begins dealing with them. The great
[2:09:54] tribulation is seven is not seven years.
[2:09:57] We've already had the first half of
[2:09:59] that. The Messiah was cut off. The was
[2:10:02] rejected. Time turned to the Gentiles.
[2:10:04] We've had seven church ages. And now
[2:10:07] they pick up for their last three and a
[2:10:09] half years which focuses on Israel's
[2:10:12] purging and preparation for the M
[2:10:14] messiah's return. And I'll just say
[2:10:15] this, if you'll look into the Bible and
[2:10:18] if you will examine the scripture,
[2:10:21] there's not one time in the book of
[2:10:23] Revelation that refers to seven years of
[2:10:25] tribulation.
[2:10:27] It refers to a time times and a half
[2:10:31] which time is one year times is two
[2:10:33] years and a half times that's three and
[2:10:35] a half years. It it does not it refers
[2:10:38] to 1,23 score days which again divided
[2:10:42] by 360s which is in the the Jewish
[2:10:45] calendar you have three and a half
[2:10:47] years. So all through the Bible you know
[2:10:50] it it it declares for the tribulation is
[2:10:53] three and a half years. Now, there are
[2:10:55] those that want to argue and say, "Well,
[2:10:57] no, there's seven years of tribulation
[2:10:59] that is ahead and that's what they're
[2:11:01] going to have and and and and what are
[2:11:04] you know, I really don't care."
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; It's not a point of argument to me
[2:11:09] because this is the way I feel about it.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; If there are seven years of tribulation,
[2:11:14] I leave before the tribulation and I get
[2:11:16] an extra three and a half years of the
[2:11:19] marriage supper of the lamb.
[2:11:24] And and you say, "Well, brother Timmy,
[2:11:25] we got to understand all about Israel
[2:11:27] there." No, we don't. We have We need to
[2:11:29] understand what our message is
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; and how to get out of here so the gospel
[2:11:34] can return to the Jews.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; See, many times people will chafe and
[2:11:38] trying to make it all these numbers up
[2:11:39] on Daniel 70s and we got to make this
[2:11:41] fit and all of this and what what we got
[2:11:44] to understand is not our message.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:50] And that takes the burden off of you.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; It's not our message.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; It's for us to understand. That's for
[2:11:56] the Jews. It had to be placed.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; You know, Joshua going into the land.
[2:12:00] Let me take a moment and say this.
[2:12:02] Joshua going into the land. And he was
[2:12:04] he was told the definition of the
[2:12:06] borders.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; He says, "Your borders will be here,
[2:12:09] here, here, here. Go to the river. You
[2:12:10] afraid Jesus. It'll come back this way."
[2:12:12] And he describes it all. But he says,
[2:12:14] "Now, Mount Sier, don't touch that. I've
[2:12:16] given that to Esau."
[2:12:18] He said, "Now the land of Moab, don't
[2:12:20] you bother them. I've given that to the
[2:12:22] children of Lot.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; That's their inheritance."
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; So there are things in the Bible that
[2:12:28] are not our inheritance.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Our inheritance is not the tribulation.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Our inheritance is not the 144,000.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; What is our inheritance? To be the bride
[2:12:42] of Jesus Christ, the manifested sons and
[2:12:45] daughters of God. That's our
[2:12:47] inheritance.
[2:12:50] So, you know, you want to have answers
[2:12:52] to everything that's going on, all the
[2:12:54] details, and God says that ain't even
[2:12:56] for you to know.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; That's for them. And I'll reveal it to
[2:12:59] them under their prophet's ministry.
[2:13:02] And do you realize when their prophets
[2:13:04] come up and they and this and that fifth
[2:13:06] seal is open to them and then they're
[2:13:08] over there crying, but you know my great
[2:13:10] grandma and grandpa and they died in the
[2:13:12] Holocaust and they were killed for the
[2:13:14] testimony that they held and they tried
[2:13:16] to hold to the law of Moses and all
[2:13:18] these truths that they knew and they
[2:13:19] walked in the light they knew and
[2:13:21] they're all lost because they didn't
[2:13:23] receive the Messiah. And them prophets
[2:13:25] that come back out and say, "Oh, no.
[2:13:27] They are given white robes
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; under the fifth seal." Amen. They were
[2:13:32] saved people, redeemed people.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because of the testimony which
[2:13:37] they held, even though they didn't
[2:13:39] recognize Christ because Israel was
[2:13:41] blinded and it wasn't time, but now's
[2:13:43] the season. And now you must recognize
[2:13:45] your day and its hour and recognize your
[2:13:48] Messiah. And don't you realize then what
[2:13:50] a rejoicing that will be when we realize
[2:13:53] grandma didn't die
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; go to hell.
[2:13:57] She died believing and she come up
[2:13:59] believing. She'll be a part of the great
[2:14:01] resurrection.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; She's a part of the redeemed. Her name's
[2:14:05] in the book.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Don't you love it?
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; Now Armageddon follows the the great
[2:14:14] tribulation. Then comes the battle of
[2:14:15] Armageddon. And I'm still quoting
[2:14:17] brother Brandham from this quote which
[2:14:19] destroys all things. So after the
[2:14:21] tribulation, the nations gather against
[2:14:24] Jerusalem. Already Israel is the
[2:14:27] troublesome stone that all nations are
[2:14:31] stumbling over.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; They got to they got to resolve the
[2:14:36] problem in the Middle East to have peace
[2:14:38] in the world. And so they will come
[2:14:41] against Jerusalem according to the
[2:14:44] Bible. Uh Christ returns with his bride
[2:14:48] and defeats the armies of the earth.
[2:14:50] That's Revelation 19. Now some people
[2:14:52] say we're already in Revelation 19.
[2:14:55] That's an error. That's a lie. They're
[2:14:57] misplacing the scripture. Sure, we are
[2:15:01] spiritually following Christ and his
[2:15:03] word with the armies following him and
[2:15:05] all that, but that that's like saying
[2:15:07] we're in the millennium because, you
[2:15:09] know, right now we, you know, sin nature
[2:15:11] no longer rules in us and we've eaten of
[2:15:14] the tree of life. And so we we uh we're
[2:15:16] now in in our Sabbath rest by the Holy
[2:15:18] Ghost. And we when when the enemy rises
[2:15:21] up, the lion rise up. Well, we just say
[2:15:23] down boy in the lamb. You know, he'll
[2:15:25] lay down by the lamb. And you know,
[2:15:27] there's peace in the valley. And so
[2:15:28] we're in the millennium. You're not in
[2:15:30] the millennium.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; I know. We're already in eternity. We're
[2:15:34] over in this eternal day. You're in a
[2:15:37] fantasy land.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; You're in the dirty here and now.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. You're having a battle.
[2:15:44] You're having to overcome Leodysia and
[2:15:46] its darkness and his lukewarmness.
[2:15:48] You're in a battle.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; You're not in the eternal day. What my
[2:15:52] soul is, it always was.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; We always was eternal.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; And besides that, our new birth places
[2:16:03] us there. We are now seated in heavenly
[2:16:05] places in Christ Jesus. We're already
[2:16:08] resurrected.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; We're already enthroned. But don't go to
[2:16:14] spiritualizing that to the point to say,
[2:16:16] "Well, the resurrection's passed."
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; See, that's what the devil wants to do.
[2:16:22] And because of this, there were men like
[2:16:24] Himenius and Felitus that rose up and
[2:16:27] Paul turned them over to Satan that they
[2:16:29] learned not to blaspheme because they
[2:16:30] were preaching using Paul's using Paul's
[2:16:34] quotes saying the resurrection is passed
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; because they spiritualized it. And
[2:16:40] that's why people spiritualize in
[2:16:41] Revelation chapter 4. Revelation 4, you
[2:16:44] don't spiritualize that. Sure, we're
[2:16:46] caught up, see with eagle eyes, see
[2:16:47] things that other ages hadn't. We're
[2:16:49] caught into heavenly places. We see
[2:16:51] things. But friends, we haven't left
[2:16:53] Leodysia to go there. We are here in the
[2:16:56] Leodysian age where it is revealed by
[2:16:58] the eagle to us.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; So, you know, don't don't pretend to
[2:17:04] live in some fantasy land that we're not
[2:17:06] we're not there. We are here in this
[2:17:09] Leodysian age, you know, looking for the
[2:17:12] rapture. Don't misplace it. Or, you
[2:17:15] know, you
[2:17:17] maybe I won't do it. Maybe there's not a
[2:17:19] Paul here to do it. But God had turned
[2:17:22] you over to Satan that you learn not to
[2:17:24] blasphe
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; because the Bible said they had caused
[2:17:27] shipwreck
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; saying the resurrection was passed.
[2:17:33] Now, as we come here, this ushers in the
[2:17:37] millennium. The bride returns for the
[2:17:40] millennium. So, this is why we're coming
[2:17:43] back at that battle of Armageddon. We're
[2:17:45] taking the world over.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; At this point, his feet will literally
[2:17:50] touch the earth. I want you to get this.
[2:17:52] He does not physically return to the
[2:17:54] earth for the rapture. We meet him in
[2:17:56] the air.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; All right. So, what
[2:18:01] what is the air? is the space expanded
[2:18:03] to redeem us. It's the expansion of
[2:18:05] redemption. And so as we meet him in the
[2:18:09] in the air and as I've said, we got to
[2:18:12] have the right atmosphere to meet him
[2:18:14] there. And so so he comes to the earth.
[2:18:19] The Bible said his feet will stand on
[2:18:22] the Mount of Olive and when it does
[2:18:24] it'll cleave in two. There'll be a great
[2:18:26] earthquake. Uh the Bible said, you find
[2:18:29] this in the book of Zechariah. And it
[2:18:31] said, "The Lord thy God will come and
[2:18:33] all his saints with him." This is the
[2:18:35] battle of Armageddon. And this is when
[2:18:38] we come to take the earth back over
[2:18:40] again. Right now, we go through the
[2:18:42] world and we're pilgrims and strangers.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; But we know this is our home. But we're
[2:18:48] like Abraham was when he was given the
[2:18:51] land, but was not yet possessor of it.
[2:18:54] So he walks through it all to look at
[2:18:56] what he has and builds altars of worship
[2:18:59] on it. But he can't possess it as his
[2:19:01] own until the iniquity of the Amorites
[2:19:04] are full. And when the iniquity of the
[2:19:06] Amorites are full, God brings them in to
[2:19:08] possess the land. And we're living in
[2:19:10] the day where the iniquity of the
[2:19:11] Amorites are now full. So the raptured
[2:19:14] saints return with Christ to reign on
[2:19:16] the earth for a thousand years. Satan is
[2:19:18] bound during this time. Peace and rap
[2:19:21] righteousness fill the earth. Then comes
[2:19:23] the great white throne judgment. After
[2:19:26] that comes the white throne judgment.
[2:19:27] The final judgment of the wicked dead
[2:19:30] occurs at after the millennium. And I
[2:19:32] want you to get this. Men will be judged
[2:19:35] according to deeds that are done in the
[2:19:37] body. The church will stand there, not
[2:19:39] the bride, the church, the foolish
[2:19:41] virgins will stand there judged
[2:19:43] according to what they did with the
[2:19:45] light. That some will be given life.
[2:19:47] Some will go enter into death. Those who
[2:19:50] are not not found in the book of life
[2:19:52] are cast into the lake of fire. This is
[2:19:55] the second death. So here we come, you
[2:19:58] know, right down toward the end. So
[2:20:02] here comes the final rebellion.
[2:20:05] And of course, this is the final
[2:20:06] rebellion where Gog and Magog comes in
[2:20:09] this book of Revelation. Now I want you
[2:20:12] to understand this is not the same Gog
[2:20:15] and Magog Russia spoke of in the book of
[2:20:18] Ezekiel. This is spoke of in the book of
[2:20:22] revelation. It's also the name for the
[2:20:24] battle that will come. And he said when
[2:20:27] the thousand years are expired, Satan
[2:20:30] will be loosed out of his prison. So he
[2:20:34] is bound for a thousand years not with
[2:20:37] log chains but chains of circumstances.
[2:20:41] He can't he will only be limited as to
[2:20:44] what he can do.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; All right? He will be chained for a
[2:20:49] thousand years and he will be loosed out
[2:20:52] of his prison. During this time of this
[2:20:54] thousand years, brother Brandham tells
[2:20:57] us that the heathen will be raised for
[2:21:00] an for our inheritance. He said people
[2:21:02] who never heard the gospel will will
[2:21:06] come and and it will be among them that
[2:21:10] you will see possibly among them they
[2:21:12] you know a child will die at 100 years
[2:21:14] old. Possibly among them there will be
[2:21:17] children that are born you know dur
[2:21:19] during that time possibly. Brother
[2:21:22] Brandham said looks like it could be
[2:21:23] looks like it didn't. I don't know. So
[2:21:25] we're saying possibly. So you know
[2:21:28] during during this time but we know
[2:21:30] there will be somebody we will rule and
[2:21:32] reign over,
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; right? And so God will raise up the
[2:21:37] heathen that never heard. And then at
[2:21:41] and then they will go out and deceive
[2:21:44] those nations which are in the four
[2:21:47] corners of the earth, Gog and Magog to
[2:21:49] gather them together to battle the
[2:21:51] number of them of whom is the sand of
[2:21:53] the sea. So at the end there's going to
[2:21:55] be a final rebellion. It'll be a
[2:21:58] rebellion of these that were raised up
[2:22:00] in the tribulation period. And they went
[2:22:04] up to the breath of the earth and
[2:22:06] compassed the camp of the saints about
[2:22:08] and the beloved city. And fire came down
[2:22:10] from God out of heaven devoured them.
[2:22:12] And the devil that deceived them was
[2:22:14] cast into the lake of fire and brimstone
[2:22:16] where the beast and false prophet are
[2:22:18] and shall be tormented day and night
[2:22:20] forever and ever. So this of course is
[2:22:25] in Satan where you will narrowly look
[2:22:29] down upon him who has deceived nation
[2:22:32] that caused all the trouble and says is
[2:22:34] this the man is this the worm is this
[2:22:36] the thing that bothered me look at him
[2:22:38] now
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; you're going to stand triumphant the
[2:22:42] bride of Jesus Christ
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; as you sit with Christ in judgment
[2:22:45] finally there comes a new heavens and
[2:22:47] the new earth eternity begins after that
[2:22:51] comes the new heavens new earth the new
[2:22:53] coming down from God out of heaven.
[2:22:55] Eternity and time blends together. The
[2:22:57] cleansed earth becomes God's eternal
[2:22:59] dwelling place. The new Jerusalem
[2:23:01] descends and God tabernacles with men
[2:23:04] forever. This is the eighth or eternal
[2:23:08] day.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; So let's go through this clearly.
[2:23:13] God's redemptive week is seven days,
[2:23:17] which equals about 7,000 years. one day
[2:23:21] with the Lord says a thousand years.
[2:23:23] Thousand years is one day. The earth has
[2:23:26] existed under 6,000 years of human
[2:23:29] governments. Six prophetic days. And
[2:23:32] we're near the end of the sixth day. How
[2:23:34] many can say the end amen to that?
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Now, we're not talking about age. We're
[2:23:39] talking about day.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; So, in the God's redemptive week, we are
[2:23:43] in the sixth day. Day one through four
[2:23:47] for the first 4,000 years was from Adam
[2:23:49] to Christ. Day five to six was, you
[2:23:53] know, those 4,000 to 6,000 years from
[2:23:55] Christ to the is to the church ages, the
[2:23:58] gentile dispensation. Day seven is a
[2:24:02] 7,000, the millennial reign. The it's a
[2:24:07] Sabbath rest for the earth. The Bible
[2:24:09] said there remainth a s rest, a Sabbath
[2:24:12] to the people of God. So there will be a
[2:24:15] Sabbath rest where the earth will rest
[2:24:18] for a thousand years. is a seventh day.
[2:24:21] And and let me just tell you um you know
[2:24:25] during that Sabbath rest um you know a
[2:24:29] millennial a millennium there it it will
[2:24:33] be a time of peace on the earth where
[2:24:35] we'll rule and reign with Christ for
[2:24:37] this thousand years. It is the earth is
[2:24:39] still in time because it is in time for
[2:24:43] a thousand years. So it's not in
[2:24:45] eternity yet. It's in still in time. And
[2:24:49] then of course the eighth day which is a
[2:24:51] new beginning beyond time. Leviticus
[2:24:54] 23:36 on the eighth day shall be a holy
[2:24:57] convocation. It is a solemn assembly. So
[2:25:00] this eighth day is not a part of time as
[2:25:02] we know it. There are only seven days in
[2:25:05] the week. So this eighth day is
[2:25:06] symbolic. It speaks of a new he a new
[2:25:09] heavens and earth. A holy convocation
[2:25:11] where no survile work is done. A day
[2:25:13] without end eternity. So this is where
[2:25:17] the earth enters into eternity. The
[2:25:20] earth is purged and time ends. And I saw
[2:25:25] a new heavens and a new earth for the
[2:25:27] first heavens and the first earth were
[2:25:30] passed away. And I John saw the holy
[2:25:32] city new Jerusalem coming down from God
[2:25:34] out of heaven. So the seventh day ends
[2:25:38] with the white throne judgment. It
[2:25:40] begins then begins the eighth day of
[2:25:42] purified earth. No more seed, no more
[2:25:45] sin, no more sorrow. The eighth day is a
[2:25:48] moment when time ends and eternal
[2:25:50] begins. The new Jerusalem, the the
[2:25:54] dwelling place of the lamb, and his
[2:25:56] bride descends. And the lamb is the
[2:25:59] light thereof. And the bride who is born
[2:26:03] of eternity, she's called out during the
[2:26:06] sixth day in the seventh church age.
[2:26:08] reigns with him during the seventh day,
[2:26:10] the millennium, dwells with him forever
[2:26:12] in the eighth day, the new heavens and
[2:26:15] earth. She is a city, a prepared people
[2:26:19] for a prepared place.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[2:26:27] So, there's no such thing as an eighth
[2:26:28] day in natural time, but there is an
[2:26:32] eternity, the unending day. Creation to
[2:26:35] Christ day 1-4. churches days 5- six
[2:26:39] millennial day seven the eternity the
[2:26:43] eighth day beyond time a return to
[2:26:46] eternity
[2:26:48] and I John saw
[2:26:51] the holy city new Jerusalem coming down
[2:26:56] from God out of heaven prepared as a
[2:26:59] bride adorned for her husband and I
[2:27:02] heard a great voice out of heaven saying
[2:27:05] behold the taberna tacle of God is with
[2:27:08] men and he will dwell with them and they
[2:27:11] shall be his people and God himself
[2:27:14] shall be with them and be their God and
[2:27:18] God shall wipe away all tears from their
[2:27:21] eyes and there will be no more death
[2:27:25] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[2:27:28] there be any more pain for the former
[2:27:31] things are passed away
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:27:37] from time back to eternity.
[2:27:42] Aren't you glad to be living in this
[2:27:44] age?
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; And this time, let's stand together. Let
[2:27:48] the musicians come.
[2:27:51] Hallelujah.
[2:27:54] Amen.
[2:27:56] Let's sing that song. In that city where
[2:27:59] the lamb is the light.
[2:28:03] in that city where there cometh no
[2:28:05] night. I have a mansion over there and
[2:28:08] it's free from toll and care.
[2:28:11] Amen. I'm going where the lamb is li.
[2:28:15] There's a country far beyond the starry
[2:28:19] sky.
[2:28:21] There's a city where there never comes a
[2:28:24] night.
[2:28:26] And if we're faithful, we shall go there
[2:28:30] right by
[2:28:32] in the city where the lamb is alive.
[2:28:38] Oh, in that city where the lamb is
[2:28:41] alive.
[2:28:43] Oh, that city where they're coming
[2:28:47] tonight.
[2:28:49] [Applause]
[2:28:50] [Music]
[2:28:56] Where the lamb is alive. There we have
[2:29:00] here we have our days of sunshine. And
[2:29:03] we know
[2:29:06] that the sun that shines upon us now so
[2:29:09] bright.
[2:29:11] We'll be changing clouds
[2:29:15] until we go to that city where the land
[2:29:19] is alive.
[2:29:22] In that city where the lamb is alive.
[2:29:27] Oh that city where there cometh no
[2:29:32] [Music]
[2:29:33] mansion over there.
[2:29:38] Oh I'm going where the land is alive.
[2:29:43] Here we have our disappointments all the
[2:29:47] while
[2:29:49] in our fondest hopes
[2:29:52] bitter life.
[2:29:54] Oh by night we weep the morning brings a
[2:29:58] smile.
[2:30:00] In that city where the lamb is the lie.
[2:30:05] Oh that city where the lamb is the lie.
[2:30:11] I see where come now
[2:30:15] [Music]
[2:30:17] over there.
[2:30:21] I'm going where the we'll see again in
[2:30:25] that city. In that city where the lamb
[2:30:29] is alive.
[2:30:32] In that city where they're coming notion
[2:30:39] over there.
[2:30:43] Oh, I'm going where the lamb is alive.
[2:30:48] And our Lord is coming back to earth
[2:30:51] again.
