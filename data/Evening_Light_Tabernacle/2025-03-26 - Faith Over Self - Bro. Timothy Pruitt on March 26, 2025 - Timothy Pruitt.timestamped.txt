[23:02] high priest that can be touched with the
[23:05] feelings of your
[23:07] infirmities. He understands human

[23:16] kind of
[23:17] mediator. Someone that could be touched.

[23:28] a way has been made. A channel has been
[23:32] opened. And I want you to lift by the
[23:34] Holy Spirit right up into the presence
[23:36] of God before the throne of grace and
[23:40] say,
[23:42] "Jesus, we need you
[23:45] tonight, we are just mere human
[23:49] beings and helpless and you know our
[23:53] humanity, but God, you became one of us
[23:57] to
[23:58] experience what we go through so that
[24:02] you could be a just and faithful high
[24:04] priest that could intercede on our
[24:07] behalf, that could say, "I know what it
[24:10] is to be sick. I know what it is to
[24:14] suffer. I know what it is to have shame.
[24:18] I even know what it is to have sin,
[24:20] though I never sinned." You could say,
[24:23] "All of the sins of the world was placed
[24:25] on me." Oh, God, what a high priest you
[24:29] are. and we're just coming before your
[24:32] throne right now saying, "Lord, we need
[24:35] you." And we're just asking that you'd
[24:37] come on the scene. That you'd bring
[24:40] healing and deliverance and salvation
[24:42] for your children. God, there are those
[24:45] all the way from the elderly, Lord, that
[24:48] suffering in their body tonight. Our
[24:50] sister Hollis, you understand her
[24:52] suffering, her need, Lord. Oh God, the
[24:55] pollen situation, the allergies,
[24:58] sicknesses going around and difficulty
[25:01] breathing. Lord, you understand. I pray
[25:04] you'll touch that little frail body
[25:07] tonight. Lift her up, Lord. Give
[25:09] strength that only you can give. Our
[25:12] brother Ben suffering in his back, Lord.
[25:15] Oh God, overwhelmed by things that have
[25:18] been happening to him in life. Oh God,
[25:21] pressing upon him and on his nervous
[25:24] situation, Lord, you know, I just ask in
[25:27] the name of Jesus that you would bless
[25:29] him mentally, physically, and
[25:32] spiritually. Ever need supply, Lord,
[25:35] move mountains in his life. Lord, for
[25:37] the Puit family that had this request
[25:40] tonight, for the baby, for the mother
[25:42] expecting a child, Lord, suffering in
[25:45] her body tonight. Oh God, will you touch
[25:48] these? heal. Lord, hands that went
[25:50] across this audience who was lifted up
[25:53] to you and said, "I have a need." Lord,
[25:55] I ask in the name of Jesus, uh, knowing
[25:58] that you're not too busy to hear a
[26:00] heart's cry, that you'll hear every
[26:02] heart's cry tonight as they reach out to
[26:05] you now with in faith, believing, and
[26:09] receive with that hand of faith now the
[26:11] promise of God for their body, healing,
[26:14] and deliverance. Now Lord, I pray that
[26:17] you'll move in this meeting tonight that
[26:19] you'll break every chain ever feder and
[26:22] you know every hindering spirit that
[26:24] would try to hinder it. We rebuke it in
[26:27] the name of the Lord. We take dominion
[26:29] over it in the name of Jesus and we
[26:32] claim victory tonight and may the Holy
[26:34] Spirit just break through from the
[26:36] channels of heaven right into this place
[26:38] today until we are lifted up into
[26:41] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. We ask

[39:42] heart. You know each life, Lord. You
[39:44] know where they're at. You know their
[39:46] address, Father. You know their life. We
[39:49] just ask, Lord, you'll meet them in a
[39:51] very special way. Be with us as we
[39:53] travel each one that goes, Lord. Bring
[39:56] us back here, Lord. Lord, be with the
[39:58] service here, Father, on Sunday. May you
[40:01] continue to pour out your blessings upon
[40:03] us. We pray in Jesus name.
[40:08] Amen. Romans 12 and verse one. and also
[40:12] Mark chapter 14 verse
[40:16] 32.
[40:21] Amen. Romans 12 and verse one says, "I
[40:23] beseech you therefore, brethren, by the
[40:26] mercies of God, that you present your
[40:28] bodies a living
[40:30] sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
[40:34] which is your reasonable service. and be
[40:37] not conformed to this world, but be ye
[40:40] transformed by the renewing of your
[40:42] mind, that you may prove what is that
[40:44] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[40:47] God. Also Mark chapter 14 and verse 32,
[40:52] and they came to a place which was named
[40:55] Gethsemane, and he saith to his
[40:57] disciples, sit ye here while I shall
[40:59] pray. And he taketh with him Peter and
[41:02] James and John, and begin to be sore,
[41:04] amazed, and to be very heavy, and said
[41:07] unto them, "My soul is is exceedingly
[41:11] sorrowful unto death. Tear ye here, and
[41:15] watch." And he went forward a little,
[41:17] and fell on the ground, and prayed, that
[41:20] it, if it were possible, the hour might
[41:23] pass from him. And he said, Abba,
[41:25] Father, all things are possible unto
[41:27] thee. take away this cup from me.
[41:31] Nevertheless, not what I will, but what
[41:34] thou wilt. Amen. We'll let you be
[41:39] seated. Just want to speak to you on a
[41:43] thought on uh faith over
[41:46] self. Faith over self. Now, I apologize
[41:50] in advance cuz you that's going to
[41:52] Oklahoma may hear it twice. I don't
[41:54] know. But I'll just go ahead and
[41:56] apologize that's what you get for going
[41:58] up there to hear your Wednesday night
[42:01] preacher. Amen. But uh we know how it
[42:04] is. God always changes things and you
[42:06] can preach the same sermon yet it's not
[42:08] the same sermon. I've seen it happen so
[42:11] many times. But faith over self and and
[42:14] we've been on the thought of the blood
[42:16] and and Cain and Abel as Abel would die
[42:20] on his altar and and of course that type
[42:23] goes throughout the Bible with Isaac and
[42:26] all the way down to Jesus and many other
[42:28] types there as well. I just want to look
[42:30] in this for a moment as we as we kind of
[42:34] break into this thought. I want to just
[42:35] take this quote. Brother Brandham said I
[42:37] he said he used to preach over and I've
[42:39] read this several times and I really
[42:41] love this. He said, "I used to preach
[42:42] over in the Baptist church a little
[42:44] sermon. I called it let loose and let
[42:47] God." Let loose and let God. That's
[42:49] right. Just let loose and let God. As
[42:53] long as you got yourself in the way,
[42:56] you're in the way. Amen. You know who
[42:58] the biggest enemy I have? That is
[43:00] William Brandom. He's always in God's
[43:03] way. If I can just get him out of the
[43:05] way, then God can go to work. That's
[43:08] your worst enemy is yourself. Just get
[43:11] yourself out of the way, then God can go
[43:14] to work. Amen. You said, "Well, that's
[43:16] pretty good for a preacher. You know, he
[43:18] has to get up and he has to get get
[43:20] himself out of the way." And yes, true.
[43:22] Brother Brandham said about a gift. He
[43:24] said, "Uh, what is a gift?" He said,
[43:26] "It's You said, "Well, somebody said, I
[43:28] got the gift of healing. I'll just go
[43:29] out and heal this one or I heal that
[43:31] one." He said, "Sure, if I could do
[43:32] that, certainly I would." But he said,
[43:34] "You misinterpret what a gift is." He
[43:37] said, "A gift is just get yourself out
[43:39] of the way and let the Holy Spirit use
[43:42] you." Amen. That's a gift. He said
[43:44] that's what a ministry is. He don't
[43:46] preach what he wants to preach. He just
[43:48] gets himself out of the way. That's the
[43:50] gift. And inspiration comes and he
[43:53] speaks through the inspiration of the
[43:55] Holy Spirit. But I I want you to
[43:57] understand, we're all we all have self
[43:59] here tonight. Amen. You bring Did you
[44:01] bring yourself to church this evening?
[44:03] We all have self. So, it's not just a
[44:05] preacher getting himself out of the way,
[44:07] but we also, amen, as we sit in the pew
[44:09] or wherever we're at. Amen. We also have
[44:12] to get ourself out of the way so that we
[44:14] can see the spirit of God move through
[44:16] us and the spirit of God anoint and and
[44:19] the spirit of God lead and guide the
[44:21] service to how he wants to do it and how
[44:24] he wants to operate and how he wants the
[44:27] whole thing to be done for his glory.
[44:28] Amen. Because we don't come here for our
[44:30] own glory or our own uh exaltation. And
[44:33] we come for his glory. Amen. Amen. I
[44:36] didn't hear us singing, "I'm such an
[44:37] awesome person." No, I heard us singing,
[44:39] "You're an awesome God." Cuz that's
[44:41] truly what he is. And so, we come here
[44:43] for that. But, you know, it takes us
[44:45] getting ourself out of the way. If you
[44:47] want anything out of a service, you got
[44:49] to get yourself out of the way. You got
[44:52] to get your pride, your arrogance, your
[44:54] your feelings, whatever you got, you got
[44:56] to lay it aside on the altar and say,
[44:58] "God, I don't need none of this. I just
[45:00] need you. I I need you to come. I need
[45:03] you to speak. I need you to minister.
[45:05] And Amen. Not only anoint the minister,
[45:07] but anoint me too that I can receive the
[45:10] word of God and I can hear the word of
[45:11] God and my ears can be open to the
[45:14] promises of the of the of the heavenly
[45:16] father. But we see here he said it's
[45:18] possible when a man like apostles when
[45:20] you can live close to God that God
[45:23] through his grace operates through you
[45:26] that the more God you get the more godly
[45:29] you become. Amen. The more God you get,
[45:32] the more godly you become, the more
[45:34] eternal life comes in, the more of the
[45:36] intellectual things it pushes out. He
[45:39] says, "I don't mean to be a fanatic. I
[45:41] mean to be a real saying, sound
[45:43] believer, not a bunch of isms, but a
[45:45] real, true, solid, sensible, intelligent
[45:48] believer. But now watch, I've seen it
[45:50] work." And to think that if you can get
[45:52] into contact with God, it'll become till
[45:54] it isn't your voice anymore. It isn't
[45:57] your voice anymore. It isn't your
[46:00] thoughts anymore. It becomes God's
[46:02] thoughts and God's voice speaking
[46:05] through you. Amen. He said, "I am the
[46:07] vine. You are the branches." So, it's
[46:09] God's voice and God's thought speaking
[46:12] through you. And then it's his spirit
[46:14] that goes in and energizes the whole
[46:16] thing. And as long as you can get
[46:18] yourself out of the way, he will fill it
[46:21] up.
[46:23] Amen. As more that you can empty out of
[46:25] yourself. We look at some ministers and
[46:27] we say, "What a gift." You know what
[46:29] that is? That is that man getting more
[46:31] of himself out of the way. Come on.
[46:34] Amen. We can look at our own self and
[46:36] say, "What a Christian." Or somebody,
[46:37] "What a Christian." That's more of that
[46:40] person getting themsself out of the way.
[46:43] If you want more of God, get more of
[46:45] yourself out of the way. And the more
[46:47] you get out, the more he will fill you
[46:50] up. Amen. That's why we can't never be
[46:53] be too much, have too much of God. Amen.
[46:55] Because we got to get so much of this
[46:57] self out of the way till this body can
[47:00] be changed.
[47:02] Amen. We have to humble oursel. We have
[47:05] to empty ourselves to God so he can
[47:07] manifest himself through us. You empty
[47:10] yourself. You get yourself out of the
[47:12] way. The biggest enemy you have is
[47:14] yourself. I wish I had a a mirror
[47:17] tonight so you can see your real enemy.
[47:19] Amen. But it's not the one sitting next
[47:21] to you or the one you argue with or some
[47:23] fuss you got somewhere else. That's not
[47:25] your biggest enemy. Your biggest enemy
[47:27] is the one that you get up in the
[47:28] morning and you look in that mirror and
[47:30] you brush those teeth or you shave or
[47:32] you comb that hair. That is your real
[47:35] enemy. That self that wants to rise up
[47:37] above the word of God. It want that self
[47:40] that wants to bring the thoughts and and
[47:42] the thinking above the word of God. That
[47:44] self that wants to keep you in bondage.
[47:46] Amen. And and and keep the word of God
[47:48] from having true liberty in your life.
[47:50] Listen, we want the word of God to have
[47:52] true liberty in our hearts. We want him
[47:54] to have the true liberty in our
[47:56] services, but we have to get ourselves
[47:59] out of the way. We got to get our
[48:01] feelings out of the way and all the
[48:03] other things that's going on and what's
[48:05] happening tomorrow and and what's
[48:07] happening the next week and my bills and
[48:09] this that and the other. We got to get
[48:10] all that out of the way. And the more we
[48:13] get out of the way, the more God will
[48:15] come down and fill our hearts with his
[48:18] presence. Amen.
[48:21] Jesus at Gethsemane had to get self out
[48:25] of the way.
[48:27] Amen. What he said. He said, "Oh father,
[48:29] if it be possible, let this cup pass
[48:32] from me." He had a will. He had a
[48:34] thought. He had had a want, a desire,
[48:37] but nevertheless, not as I will or what
[48:41] I think or how I'll think it ought to
[48:43] be. Amen. Brother Brandon would bring it
[48:45] like this and it's very very powerful
[48:47] statement. He said in that crucial hour
[48:50] until he suffered knowing all thing
[48:52] knowing all things until the water and
[48:53] blood he suffered until the water and
[48:55] blood separated in his body great drops
[48:58] of sweat like blood dropped from his
[49:00] brow. He said he died more death in
[49:03] Gethsemane than he did on the cross.
[49:07] Come on. He died more death in
[49:10] Gethsemane than he did on the cross. If
[49:12] he would not have died out to self and
[49:15] self-will, he'd have never went to
[49:17] Calvary.
[49:20] Come on. The true Christian life is to
[49:22] die to self-will. This is why people
[49:25] can't get filled with the Holy Ghost
[49:27] because there's still self on the inside
[49:29] of them. They refuse to let go of
[49:31] things. They they refuse to let go of
[49:34] situations or past hurts or past
[49:36] mistakes or past problems. and they you
[49:39] refuse and they allow self to dictate
[49:42] their lives instead of the word of God.
[49:47] Now, a true Christian life is to die to
[49:50] self-will. Now, that's an exact opposite
[49:52] of what this world is.
[49:55] This world today is all about self-will.
[49:59] Amen. You know what what is self-will?
[50:01] Self-will is a stubborn and willful
[50:03] adherence to one's own desires or ideas.
[50:07] So, it's your self-will that will not
[50:10] forgive.
[50:12] Come on. It's your self-will that holds
[50:15] bitterness in your heart. It's your
[50:17] self-will that holds things that that
[50:19] won't allow God to come in and have
[50:21] preeminence in your life. It's your self
[50:24] will. People wants their way. We're in
[50:26] Leodysia. We know what the prophet of
[50:28] God said. He said that means people's
[50:30] rights. We want our rights. We want our
[50:33] We may We may not be out on the streets
[50:34] out there in front of some congressman's
[50:36] house shouting, but we'll sit in a pew
[50:38] and we want our
[50:40] rights. Come on now. We want it the way
[50:42] we want it. We want the AC how we want
[50:44] it. We want the sound like we want it.
[50:46] We want the music like we want it. We
[50:48] want the this like we want it. Listen,
[50:50] it ain't about how I want it.
[50:53] Come on, somebody. It ain't about what
[50:55] how we want it. It's about how God wants
[50:59] it. Amen.
[51:03] But every one of us has been put on this
[51:06] earth by choice. We are not, thank God,
[51:10] robots. Honestly, I wouldn't enjoy being
[51:13] a
[51:15] robot. We have a choice. We We can make
[51:19] a choice. Yeah. You made a choice
[51:20] whether you was coming here tonight.
[51:22] Some people streaming made the choice of
[51:24] whether they're going to stream and sit
[51:25] at home or not. Amen. It was by choice.
[51:30] Everyone has been put on this earth by
[51:32] choice. Jesus even said who when he
[51:35] spoke about this he said whosoever will
[51:38] let him come. So there's a choice that
[51:41] he spoke about. You know brother
[51:42] Brandham actually speaks about the the
[51:44] the veil that's over the human heart or
[51:47] over the heart is self-will.
[51:50] It's the veil that's over the heart to
[51:52] have a will to lay down. You know it's
[51:54] amazing to have a will to lay down your
[51:57] life.
[51:59] to have a will to live. Amen. The
[52:01] reproach of of a Christian life. Amen.
[52:05] To make the choice, Amen. to do what you
[52:07] do and how you do it and how you operate
[52:10] as a Christian. That's amazing to have
[52:12] that kind of choice that you made that
[52:14] kind of choice because this world is not
[52:16] is not it's not built to for for people
[52:19] to have those kind of choices. It's
[52:21] looked down on. It's called archaic.
[52:23] It's called old fogy ideas. It's called
[52:26] an old archaic archaic book that you
[52:29] know just somebody found somewhere.
[52:30] Listen, but there's somebody that says
[52:33] no I by choice I am living this way.
[52:38] I have made my choice. I have made my
[52:40] decision. I have made my choice for
[52:43] Jesus Christ. But not only that, he made
[52:46] his choice for you.
[52:49] He could have chose himself but he
[52:51] denied himself so he could choose you.
[52:57] Hallelujah. Now, can we deny ourselves
[53:01] so we can choose him?
[53:05] You have to have there's a will to lay
[53:07] yourself down on the altar. The same
[53:09] altar that Abel laid down. The same
[53:11] altar that Isaac laid down. The same
[53:14] altar that Jesus laid down. Laid upon.
[53:18] So opposite from today. You know, people
[53:20] are in love with themselves.
[53:23] We want self to be petted. Self loves to
[53:26] be petted.
[53:28] Hello.
[53:30] It loves self loves an air conditioned
[53:32] building in 105
[53:36] degrees. Hello. Self loves a cushy pew.
[53:42] But not all selves have what we have
[53:43] been afforded.
[53:46] But they still make a choice to come to
[53:48] church
[53:50] cuz they're not, you know, because
[53:51] they're denying self. I I I've said this
[53:54] before, but I say it again. I something
[53:55] that changed my heart forever in my
[53:57] thought pattern forever was going as a
[54:00] young boy uh in 1994 to Uganda and
[54:03] showing up there to a meeting of 500,
[54:05] 700 people and there'd be one car in the
[54:08] parking lot and we drove up in
[54:10] it and it wasn't coming. and they'd be
[54:12] that, you know, full of people and
[54:14] they've been sitting there and singing
[54:15] and waiting for us to arrive and and
[54:17] they wouldn't sitting on pews like we
[54:19] sit on. They didn't have air conditioned
[54:21] building like we have or heated
[54:22] building. It was open air and it was hot
[54:24] and stuffy and and all these say, you
[54:26] know, all that around you, but they sat
[54:28] there with anticipation.
[54:31] And let me tell you, I was in we was
[54:32] also uh there where was it? Um having a
[54:35] brain freeze in Eastern Europe there, me
[54:38] and your Serbia. and we were in Serbia
[54:40] and brother Tim, you know, we're having
[54:41] a week of meetings. I'm preaching in the
[54:42] morning, he's preaching the evenings
[54:44] and, you know, he's trying to pace
[54:45] himself because it's it's hot and it's
[54:47] in open air condition and it's it's very
[54:49] hot and it's hot where you sleep and
[54:51] it's hot everywhere. And so he, you
[54:53] know, he's pacing himself and he's
[54:54] preaching about an hour, hour and a
[54:56] half, you know, or less. You know, this
[54:58] young girl, she was about what, 18 years
[55:00] old maybe. She come up and she said,
[55:02] "I'm not
[55:03] happy." She said, "You are known for
[55:06] preaching more than an hour.
[55:10] She said we are getting
[55:12] jipped and I want you to know I am not
[55:15] happy about it.
[55:19] It was say what was it? She said was
[55:21] something on the inside of her that was
[55:23] greater than herself.
[55:25] It was greater than her maybe her desire
[55:27] for a a more comfortable seat cuz it
[55:29] wasn't comfortable or a more comfortable
[55:31] building cuz it was not comfortable.
[55:33] Amen. But there was something on the
[55:35] inside of her cuz she had heard the
[55:37] truth.
[55:38] And there was a desire to hear more of
[55:40] it. You know how she heard it? She was
[55:43] sitting in a college and a young man
[55:45] walked who would later become her
[55:46] husband. He didn't know that of course
[55:48] at that time. He walked right down
[55:50] beside her and said, "You know it wasn't
[55:52] an apple, don't you?" All right. She
[55:55] said, "What? What? What' you say? What
[55:57] are you talking about?" He began to
[55:59] witness her what happened in the garden
[56:01] and God got a hold of that I think a
[56:03] Catholic little girl and so changed her
[56:05] to today. Amen. and they're a minister
[56:08] wife and ministers. Amen. Preaching the
[56:10] gospel of Jesus Christ.
[56:13] Come on. And it caused such a thirst
[56:15] into her that Amen. if she wasn't
[56:17] getting more than what she thought she
[56:19] ought to get. Amen. She was getting
[56:20] jipped. I think we ought to have the
[56:22] same attitude. We ought not ever get
[56:25] tired of the word of God and the
[56:27] blessings of Almighty God and how he
[56:29] rains down upon our lives.
[56:32] It ought to be an open fountain and say,
[56:34] "God, I want a gusher of your Holy
[56:37] Ghost."
[56:42] Well, I don't know. I ain't got that.
[56:43] Well, get rid of yourself.
[56:48] People are in love with
[56:50] themselves. Second Timothy 3 says this,
[56:53] and I'll read just a few verses in our
[56:56] know this. In the last days, perilous
[56:57] time shall come in the King James. For
[56:59] men shall be lovers of their own selves.
[57:03] I'll read this on a different
[57:05] translation because it does not define
[57:07] where we're at. I don't know what does.
[57:09] 2 Timothy 3:1 in a different translation
[57:11] says, "But we need to be aware that in
[57:14] the final days, the culture of society
[57:18] will become extremely fierce and
[57:20] difficult for the people of God. People
[57:24] will be self-centered lovers of
[57:26] themselves and obsess with money. They
[57:29] will boast of the great things that they
[57:31] they and they as they strut around in
[57:33] their arrogant pride and mock all that
[57:35] is right. They will ignore their own
[57:37] families. They will be ungrateful and
[57:39] ungodly. They will become addicted to
[57:42] hateful and malicious slander.
[57:45] Yep. Amen. Slaves to their own desires.
[57:49] They will be ferocious, belligerent,
[57:51] haters of what's good and right. With
[57:54] brutal treachery, they will act without
[57:56] restraint, bigoted and wrapped in clouds
[57:58] of their conceit. They will find their
[58:00] delight in the pleasures of this world
[58:03] more than the pleasures of the loving
[58:04] God. Amen. They may pretend to have
[58:07] respect for God, but in reality, they
[58:10] want nothing to do with the go with the
[58:12] power of God. Stay away from people like
[58:15] these.
[58:19] Come on. Amen. But it's self-willed to
[58:22] where we have got, you know, used to
[58:24] people wasn't so concerned about self.
[58:26] They would be concerned about their
[58:28] neighbors.
[58:29] Amen. They'd be concerned about helping
[58:31] somebody or doing something or making
[58:33] sure so and so is taken care of. Amen.
[58:35] But now this world that we're in is all
[58:38] about my little bubble. All right? And
[58:41] what affects my little bubble. And don't
[58:43] you dare get in my bubble,
[58:47] preacher. You better not. You can preach
[58:48] on whatever you want to, but not in my
[58:51] bubble.
[58:53] Hallelujah. Y'all sure y'all want to go
[58:55] to
[58:59] Oklahoma? Amen. We got, you know, we got
[59:01] our little walls up and our little
[59:03] protections. In the meanwhile, it's
[59:05] actually keeping us from the real
[59:07] liberty of Christ. I mean because we've
[59:10] allowed self to canker over and become
[59:12] so we self-centered in our thoughts and
[59:15] our thinking about ourselves and how we
[59:17] need to be better and how what we need
[59:19] to do and we forget about that that real
[59:22] true Christian Amen. Godly love is
[59:25] living for others.
[59:29] Amen. The service is not just about you.
[59:32] It's about everybody else in here.
[59:39] That's why I get so kind of humored at
[59:42] people say, "Well, I don't need
[59:43] church." Okay, you got all the church
[59:46] you need and you don't need church.
[59:47] Fine, but what about coming and helping
[59:48] build an atmosphere for somebody who
[59:50] still needs it?
[59:54] You got that selfish pride and arrogance
[59:57] and you're all concerned about what you
[59:59] are and who you are. Amen. It's about
[1:00:01] living for others. It's about being as a
[1:00:03] sheep and laying our wheels down and
[1:00:05] saying, "God, if there's something on me
[1:00:07] that needs to be sheared, get your
[1:00:09] shears out. Amen. Get down as deep as
[1:00:12] you got to get and get that problem out
[1:00:14] of my life. Whatever it is, I want to
[1:00:16] lay it down on your altar so I can walk
[1:00:19] away from here a different person."
[1:00:25] Self-will. Why you call it self-will,
[1:00:28] Brother Brandon? because it puts men and
[1:00:30] women back again in the Garden of Eden
[1:00:33] just like Adam and Eve.
[1:00:38] Self-will. Yeah. The two trees,
[1:00:40] self-will. One was death, one was life.
[1:00:43] Self-will. Immoral free agent. Free
[1:00:45] moral agency. God placed the first man,
[1:00:47] Adam and Eve, right there on free moral
[1:00:49] agency. He places you in the same spot.
[1:00:52] The only way that you can get this thing
[1:00:54] fixed in here is your own self-will.
[1:00:57] your self-will. You have to have a will
[1:01:00] to do God's will.
[1:01:02] Come on now. You have to have a will to
[1:01:05] get out your get out. You have to get
[1:01:07] away from your own will to let God's
[1:01:09] will come in. For this is the only
[1:01:11] channel that leads to the heart. He said
[1:01:13] it was the veil that covered the heart,
[1:01:15] self-will. And he said if you can get it
[1:01:17] out of the way, right, then God can come
[1:01:21] down and fill every fiber of that heart.
[1:01:25] Oh, you can join a church. You can join
[1:01:27] the Baptist Presbyterian, but listen,
[1:01:29] I'm not worried about that. You can join
[1:01:30] a message church, be there every Sunday.
[1:01:34] Amen. Come to sanctification,
[1:01:35] justification, but you have to will to
[1:01:38] do God's will, self-will to let the Holy
[1:01:40] Spirit come here to bring forth that to
[1:01:43] bring forth. These signs shall follow
[1:01:44] them that believe in my name. They shall
[1:01:47] cast out devils. They shall speak with
[1:01:49] new tongues. They shall lay hands upon
[1:01:50] the sick or take up deadly things and so
[1:01:52] forth. These signs shall follow them
[1:01:54] that do the that has the has let their
[1:01:57] will become my will.
[1:02:01] And the works that I do shall they do
[1:02:04] also. There's the will to do God's will.
[1:02:08] Amen. Abel led his lamb away by a great
[1:02:11] vine, sacrificed him on the altar, and
[1:02:14] Abel died on the same altar his
[1:02:16] sacrifice died on. And every believer
[1:02:20] that comes to Christ must die on the
[1:02:23] same altar with his dying lamb, Christ.
[1:02:26] If you want to rise with him, you got to
[1:02:28] die with him.
[1:02:30] You're not going to get to the rising
[1:02:32] part if you don't get to the dying part.
[1:02:35] Amen. And the dying part started in
[1:02:38] Gethsemane.
[1:02:40] That's where it happened.
[1:02:44] Oh, we we're all about the resurrection.
[1:02:46] Let me get to you got to die to self,
[1:02:49] your will and how you want things to be.
[1:02:52] It's all about it ain't all about you.
[1:02:53] It's it's it's about
[1:02:55] him. If we can ever get that thought in
[1:02:59] our every day or I say every day, but
[1:03:01] our Wednesdays and just Sunday services,
[1:03:04] you know, cuz we we come somehow get
[1:03:06] this idea that special meetings are
[1:03:07] special. And I really they are special,
[1:03:09] but every meeting ought to be special.
[1:03:13] every service it's the same God. So why
[1:03:17] would it be any less or more spe
[1:03:18] special? You know what makes it less or
[1:03:20] more special? Our own expectations of
[1:03:22] what it's going to be. Our will. Amen.
[1:03:26] What we will it to be right. Come on.
[1:03:30] Amen. If we will will it to be special,
[1:03:32] it'll be special. If you don't expect
[1:03:35] more of God, there'll be more of God to
[1:03:36] be had.
[1:03:38] Amen. If you expect God to move on a
[1:03:40] Wednesday night like he does on a
[1:03:42] Saturday night prayer line, well, he's
[1:03:44] the same God.
[1:03:48] He's not dictated by what day it is or
[1:03:50] what hour it is. He's the same
[1:03:52] yesterday, today, and forever. If he
[1:03:55] moved then, he'll move now. If you'll
[1:03:57] have your will to lay down and say,
[1:03:59] "God, I need you tonight." Yes, sir.
[1:04:05] Abel died on the altar with his lamb and
[1:04:08] every man that comes to Christ must die
[1:04:09] on that same one. We died to Christ on
[1:04:12] the altars of God's
[1:04:13] sacrifice. That makes me feel really
[1:04:16] religious to think about that. He said,
[1:04:17] "God providing the
[1:04:19] way." Hello, God. Not God trying to hurt
[1:04:23] you.
[1:04:26] You know, he he he he refers to the
[1:04:28] wheel and the wool and the wool. You
[1:04:30] ever seen you ever seen some of those
[1:04:31] videos you'll find every once in a while
[1:04:33] of those sheep that got away and was way
[1:04:36] out there in the middle of nowhere and
[1:04:38] away from everybody somehow survived and
[1:04:40] they come back and there's wool so
[1:04:42] packed around them they can't even see
[1:04:44] no more. They can't even hardly walk no
[1:04:47] more. And unless they're willing to lay
[1:04:49] themselves down and just let themselves
[1:04:52] be sheared, they'll never see again.
[1:04:55] They'll lose their way to walk. They'll
[1:04:57] they'll lose their abilities to survive
[1:04:59] because they've allowed this self to
[1:05:01] grow out so much. Amen. To where they
[1:05:03] can't they can't even operate normally
[1:05:05] no more.
[1:05:07] Come on. Amen. That's exactly what
[1:05:09] happens to a lot of Christians
[1:05:11] sometimes. We we get away from, you
[1:05:12] know, we think, well, I we we just need
[1:05:14] to get away for a little bit. We need to
[1:05:15] get in our own thing. Listen, when you
[1:05:17] get out away from the presence of God
[1:05:19] and you're not in his presence, Amen.
[1:05:21] What is it? It's allowing self-will to
[1:05:23] grow bigger and bigger and bigger and
[1:05:26] bigger. That's why we come to the house
[1:05:27] of God. So we can be sheared of
[1:05:30] self-will.
[1:05:31] So we can lay ourselves because listen,
[1:05:33] it ain't just sacrificing. Our sacrifice
[1:05:36] is not just a temporary sacrifice.
[1:05:39] It's not just a oneanddone deal. It's a
[1:05:42] living sacrifice.
[1:05:44] It's an everyday sacrifice.
[1:05:48] Listen, we we got more than Muhammads
[1:05:50] do. I mean, the Muhammad, they get this
[1:05:52] lint where they just go about 40 days.
[1:05:54] They're going to give up something.
[1:05:55] They're going to sacrifice, but after 40
[1:05:57] days, they're going to pick it up again.
[1:05:59] Well, I got a deal. I got a deal for
[1:06:01] you. You can lay it down and never have
[1:06:03] to pick it up again. Amen. Because there
[1:06:05] is a blood. Jesus paid it all. He laid
[1:06:08] his life down at Gethsemane and he died
[1:06:11] on a rugged cross and blood spilled out
[1:06:13] of his d out of his out of his body.
[1:06:15] Amen. Why? So you could have the ability
[1:06:18] to lay something down tonight and not
[1:06:21] have to worry about picking it up again
[1:06:23] in 40 days.
[1:06:25] Come on. But it'll be totally
[1:06:27] annihilated from you forever.
[1:06:31] That is the power of this lamb. If
[1:06:33] you're willing to lay yourself upon that
[1:06:36] sacrifice,
[1:06:41] Jesus paid it
[1:06:44] all. We must
[1:06:47] die on that
[1:06:49] place. I tell you friends, there's been
[1:06:51] many a man coming down to the end of the
[1:06:54] road will find out that in that little
[1:06:57] shallow religion that you're holding on
[1:06:59] to won't work.
[1:07:01] Nothing short of being born again will
[1:07:04] work.
[1:07:08] Jesus, how can I be born again? Well,
[1:07:10] you got to die to be born again.
[1:07:14] You know, he was telling that to
[1:07:16] Nicodemus. And Nicodemus is like, "What
[1:07:17] do you mean born again? I got to go back
[1:07:19] in my mother's womb." No, Nicodemus, you
[1:07:22] have to
[1:07:27] die. Except a man be born of the water
[1:07:30] and spirit and blood, he will no wise
[1:07:32] enter the kingdom. No matter if he's
[1:07:34] Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[1:07:35] message
[1:07:36] believer. This is bring it down. Current
[1:07:39] message
[1:07:40] believer. Whatever he is, he will not
[1:07:43] enter until he's born of the water and
[1:07:45] the spirit. Born means he's changed. He
[1:07:48] had to die from what he was to be born
[1:07:51] again to something new. That's right.
[1:07:53] Amen. Being born again is not going down
[1:07:55] the dead a wet center and raising up a
[1:07:57] go, you know, like you would be
[1:07:58] baptized, you know, to go down a wet
[1:08:00] center and come back up a or go down a
[1:08:02] dry one, come back up a wet one. That's
[1:08:04] not what we're interested in. Being born
[1:08:06] again is not just getting a little, you
[1:08:08] know, little raz on your anointing or
[1:08:10] some anointing on your spirit and
[1:08:11] getting excited. That's not being born
[1:08:13] again. But when you know this day I was
[1:08:16] this way, but after I met him, I'm a
[1:08:20] different person. Sure, I still got this
[1:08:22] self that I war with and I have to keep
[1:08:25] sheared off and it still tries to push
[1:08:26] his limits all the time. But there's
[1:08:28] something on the inside of me that when
[1:08:31] it sees some self poke out, it say you
[1:08:33] don't belong here no more, boy. And it
[1:08:35] cuts him right off.
[1:08:40] Except you die to yourself and be born
[1:08:42] of the spirit of God, you are lost.
[1:08:46] There's no shortcuts. Well, I belong to
[1:08:49] a church. My mother was this. my
[1:08:50] father's that. I don't doubt that. He
[1:08:52] says, "But this is what this is you I'm
[1:08:54] talking
[1:08:55] to." I'm not talking to your mom or your
[1:08:58] daddy. I'm talking to you.
[1:09:00] You got to come this way because there's
[1:09:03] no shortcuts. You're disqualified at the
[1:09:06] judgment. What he's talking about is a
[1:09:08] man who came in another way. And he's
[1:09:11] found without the garment on.
[1:09:13] What is What was the garment? The Holy
[1:09:15] Ghost.
[1:09:17] And he said, 'Well, you must have come a
[1:09:18] different way because you didn't come by
[1:09:19] this door because I am the way, the
[1:09:22] truth, and the life. Any person that
[1:09:24] comes by this door, they might have come
[1:09:26] in a rich man, poor man, whatever.
[1:09:28] Didn't matter. But once they came in,
[1:09:30] they came under a different headship.
[1:09:33] And they come under a different
[1:09:34] rulership and they changed garments. So
[1:09:37] no longer was it about being a rich man
[1:09:38] or a poor man or this man or what line
[1:09:41] they was born in or this that and the
[1:09:42] other. No, he put a different garment on
[1:09:44] them. They died to themselves.
[1:09:47] Hallelujah. That's why the blood that
[1:09:49] I'm talking about, it's not, you know,
[1:09:51] it's not about that you was born in a
[1:09:53] certain lineage or you can trace your
[1:09:55] lineage back and it's got so much so
[1:09:57] many year or generations of clear
[1:09:59] lineage and you can trace it all back.
[1:10:01] This blood will rewrite your lineage.
[1:10:04] This blood will give you a different
[1:10:06] lineage and it'll Amen. it might you
[1:10:08] might be a rich man. You might be a poor
[1:10:10] man. You might be this. You might be
[1:10:12] that. You might be a druggie. You might
[1:10:14] be an alcoholic. You might be a
[1:10:16] straightup street sinner. But when you
[1:10:17] come by that way and you die to yourself
[1:10:21] and you come up and he puts a different
[1:10:22] garment on you, you're no longer the
[1:10:25] same man no more. That old man's dead.
[1:10:30] Hallelujah. It's been put away with.
[1:10:33] It's no longer alive.
[1:10:42] He said, "We see that one
[1:10:45] time." Sorry, brother Mike in advance.
[1:10:48] Inoculation wasn't too good. So, there
[1:10:51] was a conscience away from sin of sin.
[1:10:53] Every time you'd come in, make an
[1:10:55] offering year after year. But now in
[1:10:57] Hebrews, it tells us that the worshipper
[1:11:00] is once purged. He has no more
[1:11:02] conscience of sin. In other words, no
[1:11:05] more desire to sin.
[1:11:08] The whole thing is gone from him.
[1:11:13] Amen. There it's no more. You don't have
[1:11:16] to sin every day. You don't have to do
[1:11:20] these things. You do it because you
[1:11:23] willfully want to. The reason you're
[1:11:24] willfully want to because you've never
[1:11:26] died to yourself. And brother, I know
[1:11:27] that's scorching, but it's good, ain't
[1:11:29] it? When you die to yourself, then you
[1:11:32] become a new creature in Christ Jesus.
[1:11:37] Before birth can come, we realize there
[1:11:39] has to be a death before birth. And a
[1:11:43] birth is a mess. Said, I don't care what
[1:11:46] kind of birth it is. If it's in a pig
[1:11:48] pin or a me, it's a mess. If it's a new
[1:11:49] birth or if it's a pink decorated
[1:11:51] hospital room, it doesn't matter. It's a
[1:11:53] mess. The new birth is a mess. It'll
[1:11:55] make you do things you wouldn't
[1:11:57] ordinarily think you would ever
[1:12:01] do. Hallelujah. But when you're ready to
[1:12:04] die to yourself, then you're born again
[1:12:07] a new creature in Christ Jesus, then
[1:12:09] things open up and life becomes a new
[1:12:11] sight to you because you've accepted the
[1:12:13] person of Jesus Christ. Not some theory,
[1:12:15] not some creed. It's or even to the
[1:12:18] written word. It's got to be quickened
[1:12:20] by the Holy Spirit. No matter how much
[1:12:22] theology you got, it's just laying there
[1:12:24] dead. Anyhow, he said, "I have I can
[1:12:27] have a handful of wheat, but until it's
[1:12:28] in the process to where it can be
[1:12:30] quickened, that wheat will never live."
[1:12:32] You can have a doctor's degree, you can
[1:12:34] do whatever you wish to, but until that
[1:12:36] Holy Spirit comes upon that and
[1:12:38] quickened you to a personal experience
[1:12:40] with Christ, when then the wheat is no
[1:12:43] good. Your learning is in vain. He said,
[1:12:45] as an Englishman the other night was
[1:12:47] here, I was so astonished. He said, "All
[1:12:49] the learning he had is Paul. He had to
[1:12:51] forget in order to know Christ or to
[1:12:53] find him to do the things he thought he
[1:12:56] wouldn't ever do. So that's the way God
[1:12:58] does it. He imu he he humiliates us in
[1:13:01] our own educational systems. He said now
[1:13:04] I'm not trying to support ignorance but
[1:13:06] I'm trying to tell you the difference.
[1:13:07] Education will never bring life.
[1:13:12] Listen, I ain't even wor I ain't even
[1:13:13] just necessarily talking about out there
[1:13:15] in those schools out there of colleges
[1:13:17] and stuff. I'm talking about people
[1:13:19] Amen. Just bring it on down to people
[1:13:20] being educated into the message. We
[1:13:23] ain't interested in educating you into
[1:13:25] having degrees of the message. If you
[1:13:28] ain't got the life, what good is
[1:13:29] education? Amen. But education will
[1:13:32] never bring life. It actually will take
[1:13:34] the spirit of God to bring life. And
[1:13:36] that life must not come out of just an
[1:13:38] intellectual revival. It's got to come
[1:13:40] out of the Bible, a word revival. And
[1:13:43] that word is the same yesterday, today,
[1:13:45] and forever. And when it falls today and
[1:13:47] quickens, you'll get the same results
[1:13:50] you did in Acts two. Exactly. It always
[1:13:53] has and it always will.
[1:13:58] Hello. It always has and it always will
[1:14:01] because the spirit of God conditions the
[1:14:04] atmosphere.
[1:14:08] Oh, so we got to have the spirit of God.
[1:14:10] Well, how do we get the spirit of God?
[1:14:12] We yield ourselves. We get self-will out
[1:14:14] of the way. So the spirit of God can
[1:14:16] come down. So the spirit of God can come
[1:14:18] down so we can have the right atmosphere
[1:14:21] for lives to be quickened.
[1:14:24] It takes
[1:14:27] atmosphere. He said that's the reason
[1:14:29] you men are always taught and you bring
[1:14:31] your children here. Was glad to see my
[1:14:33] doctor, my daughter Rebecca come in and
[1:14:34] sit down. Just a few minutes ago,
[1:14:36] somebody seen me wink at a woman. It was
[1:14:38] my daughter. So she come in, sat down. I
[1:14:41] want her to receive the baptism of the
[1:14:42] spirit. That's why she's here in this
[1:14:44] meeting. That's the purpose of it. It
[1:14:46] takes atmosphere. He said, "Oh, Dr.
[1:14:49] Bosworth used to say, you just take a
[1:14:50] hint egg and put it under a pulp. It'll
[1:14:52] ha a pup. It'll hatch a chicken." Why?
[1:14:54] Because it's an egg. It's got if it gets
[1:14:56] in the right atmosphere. And he said, "I
[1:14:58] don't care if you're Methodist, Baptist,
[1:15:00] Presbyterian, message believers in the
[1:15:03] right atmosphere, it'll hatch out a
[1:15:05] newborn son of God." Amen. It's
[1:15:08] atmosphere that does it. No matter what
[1:15:11] denominational tag you have.
[1:15:15] Hello. Well, you say, "Well, I'm have
[1:15:17] you to know I ain't of no denomination."
[1:15:19] That same denominational spirit is right
[1:15:21] in the message.
[1:15:23] Those spirits never die. Don't you think
[1:15:25] they're going to try to come right in
[1:15:26] and come with the same creeds and the
[1:15:28] same dog and the same ideas and clamp
[1:15:30] down
[1:15:32] and do exactly what they did for every
[1:15:34] denomination of prior,
[1:15:37] right?
[1:15:39] Amen. man. He said, "I used to herd
[1:15:40] cattle and I noticed a ranger. We'd take
[1:15:42] them up the forest out of the feeding
[1:15:44] lands down into the ranches, put them in
[1:15:45] the forest, he'd stand there and watch
[1:15:47] them as it went through the gate." He
[1:15:48] never paid no attention so much to the
[1:15:50] brand because there's all kind of
[1:15:51] brands. But there did notice the blood
[1:15:53] tag. It had to be a third bred Heroford
[1:15:56] or it couldn't go into that forest
[1:15:57] because it's a Herford association. They
[1:16:00] was able to graze it. It had to have a
[1:16:01] blood tag to keep the breeding right.
[1:16:04] And he said, "I think that's the way
[1:16:05] it'll be on the day of judgment." He's
[1:16:07] not going to ask me if I was a
[1:16:08] Methodist, a Baptist, a Pentecostal, a
[1:16:12] Presbyterian, or a message believer.
[1:16:14] He's going to look for a blood tag. And
[1:16:17] when I see the blood,
[1:16:20] I'll pass over you. You'll not see the
[1:16:24] judgment.
[1:16:27] I was having a conversation today with a
[1:16:28] minister friend of mine and we was
[1:16:30] talking about the world and and not just
[1:16:32] the world but people even in our own
[1:16:33] ranks that have done things and you take
[1:16:35] extra extra steps as into our government
[1:16:39] and all the all the cruelty that's
[1:16:41] behind it and you know all the stuff
[1:16:43] that's behind the veils of of being the
[1:16:46] US government and all the stuff that's
[1:16:47] been there through the years and stuff
[1:16:49] they're trying to bring out and all this
[1:16:51] junk. And he said, 'I tell you one
[1:16:53] thing, judgment day going to be a very
[1:16:55] interesting day.
[1:16:57] Cuz in that day, there ain't going to be
[1:16:59] redacting.
[1:17:01] Nothing redacted. If it's written there,
[1:17:05] it's going to be read there.
[1:17:08] But if you want it redacted,
[1:17:11] get it under the blood right now.
[1:17:14] If you want it re your your history
[1:17:17] rewrote, all you got to do is say,
[1:17:19] "Father, forgive me. I'm sorry, Lord. I
[1:17:22] I want to lay myself back down on that
[1:17:24] altar, and he will redact everything the
[1:17:28] devil said about you, but there's going
[1:17:30] to be some that's going to be standing
[1:17:31] there, and they never came under that
[1:17:37] blood. And he said, he said, Lord, wrote
[1:17:40] in the last text, he said, Lord,
[1:17:42] whatever, let me be standing by you.
[1:17:48] That's where I want to be.
[1:17:52] Amen. As we look at a couple more
[1:17:55] things, we see another woman. I want to
[1:17:59] just take a for just a brief moment on a
[1:18:01] a woman in the
[1:18:03] Bible. She had to lay herself
[1:18:09] down. It was a poor little woman. Didn't
[1:18:11] have
[1:18:13] much, but she knew who God
[1:18:16] was.
[1:18:20] Listen, we may not have
[1:18:22] much. Our church may not be the biggest
[1:18:25] churches. Our our our message movement
[1:18:29] may not be the biggest
[1:18:31] movement. Or this message, this word may
[1:18:34] not have affect the most people that
[1:18:36] others, you know, the billions of
[1:18:38] Catholics and thou h millions of
[1:18:40] Pentecostals or
[1:18:42] whatever. We might be looked at as a
[1:18:44] poor little
[1:18:46] woman, but as long as we know him.
[1:18:51] That's all that matters.
[1:18:53] And this little woman was a poor
[1:18:56] woman. And you'll know the story. She
[1:18:59] went one morning into her barrel and it
[1:19:01] was going down and down and down and
[1:19:03] down and down day after day getting less
[1:19:07] and less. There's no going there's not
[1:19:10] going to I'm getting down to my last few
[1:19:12] my last week getting to my last few
[1:19:16] days. Circumstances were getting worse
[1:19:19] and worse and
[1:19:23] worse. But I want you to understand God
[1:19:26] was letting it get that
[1:19:31] way. Said he loves to do that. He loves
[1:19:33] to put your faith to the test to see
[1:19:37] what you will do in that
[1:19:40] circumstance. Will you fold the cards
[1:19:42] and throw them on the table and walk
[1:19:44] away? Go back into your going into some
[1:19:46] mlly grub somewhere or how are you going
[1:19:49] to stay? Will faith rise up over
[1:19:53] self? And here she is. He loves to
[1:19:58] see how it would be if you get get let
[1:20:01] you be anointed and prayed for and
[1:20:03] sickness gets
[1:20:05] worse. He'll even say, "Come on, Satan.
[1:20:08] Put him to the
[1:20:09] test because I know he believes
[1:20:12] me. Oh my, put him to the test. I know
[1:20:16] he took my
[1:20:17] word." Could he say that about
[1:20:22] you? Question mark.
[1:20:25] He said that about Job. Do do anything
[1:20:27] to him you want to do, but don't take
[1:20:28] his life. For I know he loves me. He's
[1:20:30] made burnt offerings. He's made
[1:20:32] requirements. He did what I told him. He
[1:20:33] believes. Roll the coals over him if you
[1:20:35] want to. He took everything away from
[1:20:37] him. But God dubbed it all back when the
[1:20:40] devil was through.
[1:20:43] See, God does that. He puts our faith to
[1:20:45] a test to see if we really believe he is
[1:20:48] God.
[1:20:50] That little woman, no doubt, I prayed. I
[1:20:52] prayed and I I'm just unworthy. a
[1:20:55] gentile. He says, remember Jesus spoke
[1:20:57] of her in the Bible. He says, "Wasn't
[1:20:58] there many widows in the day of Elijah,
[1:21:01] but he was only sent to one and she was
[1:21:04] a gentile?"
[1:21:06] Come on. She was sent to one and he was
[1:21:08] a gentile. And he says, "I prayed and I
[1:21:11] prayed. Maybe she seen that last little
[1:21:13] bit of moisture and and flour that she
[1:21:16] could pull together and it was going to
[1:21:18] make her last cake. One more little
[1:21:21] bite and she was going to die.
[1:21:24] and not only
[1:21:25] herself but her son.
[1:21:32] This is quite a test
[1:21:35] because there's a lot of things we would
[1:21:37] maybe do for ourselves, but we might not
[1:21:39] do the same choices if somebody else,
[1:21:40] one of our kids are involved.
[1:21:45] God got her in a real
[1:21:48] situation, real touchy spot.
[1:21:54] see her all night praying. Hot winds of
[1:21:56] blowing earth parts. They was in a
[1:21:58] famine. People screaming and crying,
[1:22:01] walking around the house. She looked at
[1:22:03] her little boy, looked at his little
[1:22:05] pajamas, his little stick, his little
[1:22:07] feet sticking out, looked at her hands
[1:22:09] all shriveled up and wrinkled walking
[1:22:12] back and forth. But she said, "I know
[1:22:14] he's God, and I've made my confession.
[1:22:18] and I've done everything he's required
[1:22:20] and I'm asking for our lives for his
[1:22:24] glory. The rest of them was going out
[1:22:26] maybe doing different things, you know,
[1:22:28] and wasn't all that concerned about it
[1:22:30] yet. Maybe they wasn't in the same
[1:22:31] condition she was
[1:22:34] in. But here she was and daylight broke
[1:22:36] and she walks out and she said, "That
[1:22:38] old fella, he cried all night and I got
[1:22:41] one little handful of meal. I'll just
[1:22:43] make him a cake and we'll
[1:22:45] die." He said, 'You know that meal was
[1:22:49] Christ. It meal was Christ and and you
[1:22:51] know that meal offering, it had to be
[1:22:53] ground with a special bird. So every
[1:22:55] little piece of corn was the same
[1:22:57] because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:22:59] yesterday, today and forever. Every
[1:23:01] believer will believe that and rest upon
[1:23:03] it. You can have all your old corn
[1:23:05] religion all you want for want to. But
[1:23:07] for me, I believe he's the same
[1:23:09] yesterday, today, and forever. And I
[1:23:11] will make my stand in a world of
[1:23:13] infidels. Amen.
[1:23:15] I still believe he's the same yesterday.
[1:23:17] And they burn and they cut it till it
[1:23:19] was all the same to represent Christ.
[1:23:23] The oil means the spirit. We know it
[1:23:26] according to Ezekiel 4. That's the
[1:23:28] reason why anoint with oil and this it's
[1:23:29] a spirit. And John St. John 4 says the
[1:23:32] father seeketh those that are worship
[1:23:34] him in spirit and truth. Jesus was the
[1:23:36] truth. He was the meal offering. But you
[1:23:38] also have to have the spirit.
[1:23:41] You have to have a mixed together to
[1:23:43] make to make a cake to make something
[1:23:45] that you can get strength from.
[1:23:49] I mean, we got a lot of people that
[1:23:50] wants just the word or they want just
[1:23:52] the spirit. But unless you got both of
[1:23:54] them, you don't have anything you can
[1:23:56] mix together that'll make something that
[1:23:58] you can eat and it'll give you strength
[1:24:01] for the journey.
[1:24:07] Spirit mixed with truth. Put it together
[1:24:10] makes a cake. When God's word's preached
[1:24:14] in the power of the resurrection and
[1:24:16] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:24:18] and forever, and the word goes forth,
[1:24:20] the meal, and you got the oil to mix
[1:24:22] with it.
[1:24:24] Uhoh. Hello. Did you hear that?
[1:24:28] He said, "The word goes forth the meal,
[1:24:31] but you have to have the oil to mix with
[1:24:33] it." Where do I get the oil? Take the
[1:24:36] veil of self off so the spirit can come
[1:24:40] down and fill that heart.
[1:24:44] And then when the word goes forth,
[1:24:46] there's spirit there to catch it and mix
[1:24:48] it together so you can have strength for
[1:24:50] the journey. This is why some people get
[1:24:53] so tore up and mixed up. Amen. Because
[1:24:55] they get one or the other. They get a
[1:24:57] little little move of the spirit on
[1:24:58] their on their outward realms and they
[1:25:00] get all happy and dance and they go
[1:25:02] right back the same person. But if you
[1:25:04] will get to such a point that that
[1:25:06] spirit is not just on your spirit, it's
[1:25:08] not just on your flesh, but it's all the
[1:25:10] way down in your heart. When that word
[1:25:13] comes forth, you can mix it with that
[1:25:15] and it'll give you something that'll
[1:25:17] give you strength to face your enemy.
[1:25:26] It'll give you something that'll give
[1:25:28] you strength when you get a doctor's
[1:25:30] report that ain't no good
[1:25:33] for
[1:25:36] yourself. So, I see a little day after
[1:25:39] daylight they voice speaks to her and
[1:25:41] says, "Go out in the yard and get two
[1:25:43] sticks." He said, "What was that two
[1:25:45] sticks representing?" Self
[1:25:48] sacrifice. It was a representation of
[1:25:51] the cross.
[1:25:54] lay one across the other representing a
[1:25:56] cross. But it wasn't just representing
[1:25:58] the cross of Jesus. It was representing
[1:25:59] her
[1:26:02] cross. And she was to lay it there. And
[1:26:05] as she's out gathering these two
[1:26:07] sticks, she hears a voice
[1:26:10] speak. And that gloomy moment when she
[1:26:12] thought all all the world was crashing
[1:26:14] around her and it was her last few
[1:26:16] moments on the earth, she heard a voice
[1:26:18] speak. It says, "Fetch me a vessel of
[1:26:23] water." She turned and looked with these
[1:26:25] two sticks in her hand and mealled an
[1:26:27] oil ready to
[1:26:29] mix. And she ready to lay it on her
[1:26:32] cross of self-sacrifice to deny anything
[1:26:34] that's contrary to the word. And the
[1:26:37] voice said, "Bring me a little drink of
[1:26:38] water." And she looks and she sees a man
[1:26:40] standing leaning across the gate, thin
[1:26:42] cheek, bearded, bald-headed, looking
[1:26:44] across the gate with a whole piece of
[1:26:46] sheep skin wrapped around him. looked
[1:26:48] like he was go kind of a kindl looking
[1:26:50] old gentleman. She said, "I'll share my
[1:26:51] water with him." Waters of life. You're
[1:26:53] willing to give that to anybody? Tell
[1:26:54] anyone. Yeah, just a moment, sir. And
[1:26:56] she starts to walk back at and said,
[1:26:58] "Not only your water, but bring me a
[1:27:00] little morsel of bread that's in your
[1:27:01] hand."
[1:27:06] My last piece.
[1:27:10] My last
[1:27:13] piece. It's kind of like that old fella
[1:27:15] that was asking his buddy said, 'You
[1:27:18] know, hey, if you got 10 cows, would you
[1:27:21] give me one of them? He said, 'Of
[1:27:22] course. If I had 10 cows, I'd give you
[1:27:24] one of them. Well, if you had 20
[1:27:27] chickens, would you give me two of them?
[1:27:29] He said, "Well, yeah, of course. If I
[1:27:31] had 20 chickens, you the best friend I
[1:27:33] ever had. I'll give you two of them." He
[1:27:35] said, "Well, if you had two hogs, would
[1:27:37] you give me one of them?" He said, "Now
[1:27:38] you know I got two hogs.
[1:27:45] It gets a little serious when you only
[1:27:47] got one left.
[1:27:51] Been all right if she had a barrel full
[1:27:52] of it, but she didn't have it. She just
[1:27:54] scraped everything that she had and
[1:27:56] she's carried in her hand to go put it
[1:27:58] upon the fire, right?
[1:28:01] And she's asked for sacrifice,
[1:28:04] self sacrifice, because she knows if she
[1:28:07] gives this to him, they're going to die
[1:28:09] to right now. is
[1:28:11] over. Only thing they was really doing
[1:28:13] was prolonging their death.
[1:28:16] Hello.
[1:28:18] That's only do what you do with
[1:28:19] yourself. You're prolonging your death.
[1:28:22] You're going to die one day.
[1:28:26] You get what I'm saying? We're all
[1:28:28] coming to that moment. But if you can
[1:28:30] die
[1:28:31] now, you can be raised again to never
[1:28:34] die again.
[1:28:37] But here she is. She's got this one last
[1:28:39] bit. And she hears this
[1:28:44] voice. Fetch me a little cake
[1:28:48] first. He said, "What is it?" It's
[1:28:50] always God first. No matter what anybody
[1:28:53] else says, no matter what you say, it's
[1:28:56] always God first.
[1:28:59] Well, the doctor says, "I can't weigh
[1:29:00] again." Well, it's God's word first.
[1:29:05] God's word supersedes what the doctors
[1:29:08] say.
[1:29:09] Come on, somebody. Well, I'm too much of
[1:29:12] a sinner. I'm this. I'm a gambler. I'm a
[1:29:14] drunker. It's God's word first.
[1:29:17] What God has spoke overrides everything
[1:29:20] the devil could ever say about you.
[1:29:28] Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.
[1:29:30] Fetch me a little water. She looked at
[1:29:32] him, but there was something told her
[1:29:35] that this man knew what he was
[1:29:38] saying. See, what was it? Is my sheep
[1:29:41] knows my voice.
[1:29:43] She was a sheep.
[1:29:46] God knows where his sheep are.
[1:29:49] Oh, they might be out there, been out
[1:29:50] there away from a lot of things and so
[1:29:52] ged over with self, they don't even look
[1:29:54] recognizable, but they're still a sheep.
[1:29:58] Hello. They're still a sheep.
[1:30:01] She turns in
[1:30:04] obedience and she comes and she lays
[1:30:07] herself down upon the altar. She makes a
[1:30:10] cake and she brings it to
[1:30:16] him. It was her last moment. She
[1:30:20] thought she thought, "This is it. I've
[1:30:23] gave it. That's sorry, son. I I've done
[1:30:26] it."
[1:30:29] And he said she turned to walk away and
[1:30:31] she hears that voice speak says because
[1:30:34] you have done this the barrel will not
[1:30:37] go dry and the oil the oil will not go
[1:30:40] dry in the flask. And every day from
[1:30:43] that moment till the famine was over.
[1:30:45] She could go there and she could scoop
[1:30:46] out that last bit
[1:30:49] and she could make a cake. And she
[1:30:51] wanted to go back again. It was there
[1:30:52] again. She went back again. It was there
[1:30:55] again. Day after day after day. Do you
[1:30:58] see how you get rewarded when you lay
[1:31:00] yourself down? Let me tell you, you'll
[1:31:03] get a lot more than you give.
[1:31:07] Hallelujah. There's a lot more worth
[1:31:10] giving up. I mean, your life that you
[1:31:12] lay down and pride and your arrogance
[1:31:14] and all that nonsense of your life that
[1:31:16] you've allowed to become yourself and
[1:31:19] your
[1:31:20] bubble. If you'll just lay under his
[1:31:22] presence willingly and say, "Lord, I
[1:31:25] want you're one of your sheep. take this
[1:31:27] out of my life.
[1:31:29] It will be worth it all
[1:31:32] when you see him. Abel died on the same
[1:31:35] altar. And the only way you're ever
[1:31:38] going to get right with God is the day
[1:31:39] on to die on the altar with Christ until
[1:31:42] you become everything becomes black
[1:31:45] around you. Die and then you will rise
[1:31:51] again. Then you'll be a new creature in
[1:31:55] Christ.
[1:31:57] Let's bow our
[1:32:00] hearts. Faith over self.
[1:32:13] Listen, if you will give your your be
[1:32:15] your life to him and lay it upon his
[1:32:17] altar, you won't have to worry about
[1:32:19] that meal barrel running
