[34:23] Corinthians 5 verse1 also Hebrews rews

[34:35] in Florida with Adriana and and her
[34:38] husband Ben and the church there brother
[34:40] Danny also sends his greetings back and

[34:50] our family amen here God bless you
[34:54] tonight also I see brother Tim sister
[34:56] Angie back God bless you
[34:58] amen glad you're back with us made it
[35:00] safely hope your trip was
[35:02] successful amen let's just read the
[35:05] scripture here 2 Corinthians 5 and verse
[35:08] one says for we know that if our Earthly
[35:11] House of this Tabernacle were dissolved
[35:14] we have a building of God and house not
[35:16] made with hands Eternal in the heavens
[35:19] for in this we groan earnestly Desiring
[35:22] to be clothed upon with our house which
[35:25] is from Heaven if so be we that be
[35:28] clothed we shall not be found naked for
[35:31] we that are in this Tabernacle do grow
[35:33] be in burdened not for that we would be
[35:36] unclothed but clothed upon that
[35:39] mortality might be swallowed up of life
[35:42] now he that hath wrought us for the
[35:44] selfs same thing as God who also has
[35:47] given us the earnest of the spirit
[35:49] therefore we are always confident
[35:51] knowing that while we are here we are at
[35:54] home in the body we are absent from the
[35:56] Lord for we walk by faith and not by
[36:00] sight Hebrews chap 11 and verse 5 says
[36:04] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[36:07] should not see death and was not found
[36:10] because God had translated him for
[36:13] before his translation he had this
[36:16] testimony that he pleased God for
[36:19] without faith it is impossible to please
[36:21] him for he that cometh to God must
[36:24] believe that he is and that he is a
[36:26] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[36:30] Him amen God bless you be seated this
[36:34] evening I I I this thought has been on
[36:36] my heart for a little while and I
[36:39] actually ended up studying on it while I
[36:41] was away and preaching on it on Sunday
[36:43] at brother Danny's Church there and like
[36:46] to bring it to you today on faith to
[36:49] keep
[36:49] walking amen Faith to keep walking I I
[36:53] believe you know that's something we
[36:55] have to do in this hour is just to keep
[36:57] taken another step I don't care how long
[37:00] how far along the journey you've been
[37:02] how long you've been in the message how
[37:03] many degrees you got you got to keep
[37:06] walking can't keep walking with the Lord
[37:08] and I I believe that's how Enoch was he
[37:11] had a testimony that he pleased God and
[37:14] how how how did he please him because he
[37:16] had faith that he was going to do what
[37:18] he said he was going to do amen he had
[37:21] Faith to believe him that he is and he's
[37:23] the rewarder of them that diligently
[37:25] seek him now we know that the the devil
[37:27] is always that's one that's one tactic
[37:30] we can look back and we will at Eve a
[37:32] little bit and we can see that's where
[37:34] he brought us to the condition that
[37:36] we're in is because she quit walking
[37:38] with God she started she stopped for
[37:40] just a moment and that's his tactic Amen
[37:43] to try to make you stop for just a
[37:45] moment instead of walking by faith and
[37:48] begin to try to reason things out and
[37:50] try to think how it ought to be and and
[37:52] come up with your own ideas and and and
[37:55] and and true it's not really your own
[37:57] IDE ideas is his ideas amen because
[38:00] we're either uh either influenced by one
[38:02] or two Realms there's there's there's
[38:04] the the realm below or the real above
[38:07] amen that we're either influenced and we
[38:09] see the world and their free thinking
[38:11] and where it's taken them is taking them
[38:13] to a very dark place and it's not their
[38:16] own thinking they they might think I
[38:18] want to think my own thoughts I want to
[38:20] be my own person I want to do what I
[38:22] want to do but they're being influenced
[38:24] by another world and that world is be
[38:27] very prevalent amen and we can see it in
[38:30] flesh of human beings upon the Earth and
[38:33] I I get amazed that as what's coming out
[38:36] of hell you can see it coming out of
[38:38] hell because it's coming out of humans
[38:41] and it's coming out of out of their
[38:43] lives and the way they think and their
[38:45] hatred and and their and their and their
[38:48] way they speak and the way they they
[38:50] operate you can see exactly where it's
[38:52] coming from but I also believe that
[38:54] there's other another part to that that
[38:56] there's another people that that's not
[38:57] influenced From Below but they're
[38:59] influenced from above and that also is
[39:02] coming out of their lives and and it's
[39:04] coming out of what they believe and how
[39:06] they speak and how they talk and how
[39:08] they think you know a Christian always
[39:10] looks at the Unseen things amen every
[39:13] Redemptive of blessing of God every
[39:15] Redemptive blessing of God is unseen the
[39:18] armor of God love and faith and joy
[39:21] longsuffering goodness uh meekness
[39:24] gentleness patience it's all unseen
[39:26] forces that works in the heart of a
[39:28] Believer as brother Brandon would tell
[39:30] somebody go buy me a court of love go
[39:32] buy me some Joy go you can't do it it's
[39:35] unseen thing that's we but we look at
[39:37] things we do not see and and if we're
[39:40] children of Abraham then we don't walk
[39:42] by sight we walk by faith amen for
[39:45] Abraham walked by faith calling those
[39:47] things that were not as though they were
[39:50] because God said they were and I believe
[39:52] we can do the same thing in this hour
[39:54] that we can call at those things that
[39:57] are not as though they are we can call
[39:59] ourselves healed even though we're sick
[40:01] we can call oursel Delivered even though
[40:04] there's things that sitting there amen
[40:06] we're we're we're expressing what God
[40:08] has said in his word I I believe every
[40:10] child of Abraham does that they they
[40:13] look to the Unseen Joshua a son of
[40:16] Abraham you know he had no way of
[40:18] knowing how he was going to take the
[40:19] city of J Jericho and maybe Caleb had no
[40:22] way of knowing how he was going to take
[40:24] that mountain but they believed it
[40:26] anyhow because because God said they
[40:28] would he said I'm going to give you the
[40:30] land and I I've got an angel that'll go
[40:32] before you and in the journey Joshua had
[40:35] found at that this great God living in
[40:38] that Pillar of Fire that angel of God
[40:41] had performed all the Miracles had done
[40:43] everything he said he would do and here
[40:45] they are in the Jour in the journey into
[40:48] the promised land and I I've always said
[40:50] this I I don't believe uh uh Joshua and
[40:52] Caleb were walking around and when they
[40:54] went there with the 12 Spies looking at
[40:56] how big the Giants were with their
[40:58] measuring stick and saying wow these are
[41:00] 12T tall that one's 14 foot look how big
[41:03] this wall is look look how impossible
[41:05] that's not what they were looking at
[41:07] they were looking at what God Said and
[41:09] God said this was their land it may not
[41:12] have looked like it it may have not they
[41:14] may have not acted like it but God had
[41:16] already spoken and so they could already
[41:18] call that which was not as though that
[41:21] it were amen so they could look at his
[41:23] mountain and say this is where I'm going
[41:25] to build my house this is how I'm going
[41:27] to do it well what about the Giants it
[41:28] don't matter about the Giants God gave
[41:30] me that land God gave me that possession
[41:33] and so they would walk by faith they had
[41:35] seen all the Wonders they had seen all
[41:37] the things that he had done and God said
[41:40] I give it to you but you go possess it
[41:42] God has given every sick person in here
[41:45] Divine
[41:46] Healing amen it's in the word of God
[41:49] Jesus was wounded for our transgressions
[41:52] with his stripes we are healed it's
[41:54] yours but you will have to fight for
[41:56] every inch you possess every one of us
[41:59] will you you'll have to fight for
[42:01] anything you get out of any service
[42:03] you're not going to be able to just sit
[42:05] there and it just come automatically no
[42:07] we're going to have to draw our swords
[42:09] and we're going to have to walk in faith
[42:10] believe in what God said he's going to
[42:13] perform and what God said he said he
[42:16] would be here Among Us so if he's here
[42:18] Among Us he's going to perform the word
[42:20] he has for us in this season so there
[42:23] has to be somebody amen that is looking
[42:26] not at what they see you may what you
[42:28] see may be doubts what you see may be
[42:30] fears what you see may be uh
[42:33] circumstances around you and things that
[42:35] have clouded up your thoughts throughout
[42:37] the day and hurt you in some kind of way
[42:39] and wants to muddle up your being but if
[42:41] you look beyond all of that and you'll
[42:43] look to the Unseen that's out there in
[42:46] front of us God will perform what he
[42:49] said he would do now if any would have
[42:51] just kept looking at what was around him
[42:53] he would have never took the body change
[42:55] but he kept looking what was before
[42:59] him Amen brother brand said if you want
[43:01] to be well you put a well body before
[43:03] you and you walk into it I believe if it
[43:06] would go that for a natural body how
[43:08] much more does it go for that for the
[43:10] spiritual body let's put a a change body
[43:13] out there in front of us and let's put
[43:15] that before our eyes and start walking
[43:17] towards
[43:19] it amen Footprints is possession so
[43:23] let's take every inch of the ground that
[43:25] God give us that's what he told Abraham
[43:27] you walk the breath of it you walk it
[43:29] and what you walk I will give to you if
[43:31] you haven't got the baptism of the Holy
[43:33] Ghost Peter said the promises unto you
[43:36] and to your children and to them that
[43:38] are a far off even as many as the Lord
[43:40] Our God shall call Footprints is
[43:43] possession so let's go get it it's ours
[43:47] amen Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[43:50] today and forever let's possess it the
[43:52] works that I do shall you do also let's
[43:55] possess it it's God's promise it's God's
[43:58] word we don't look at the circumstances
[44:00] we don't look how hard it is let's
[44:02] possess the
[44:05] land we have a meeting and the Holy
[44:08] Ghost falling in the place and people
[44:10] screaming and shouting praising the Lord
[44:12] then somebody come up and say pray for
[44:14] me and you lay hands on them and pray
[44:16] for them now and then you say now go and
[44:18] believe see here's what it is he said
[44:20] it's easy to feel the power of God to
[44:23] see it when you believe it but then when
[44:25] it comes to a show down are you able to
[44:28] possess the thing you profess to
[44:32] have it's easy to possess things amen
[44:36] when you're in a group and and and the
[44:38] spirit of the Lord is falling and you
[44:40] can possess happiness and you can
[44:42] possess Joy but what about in your
[44:44] bedroom what about in your
[44:46] car when you're all along and the devil
[44:49] wants to come and put thoughts in your
[44:51] mind he wants to torment you you can
[44:53] possess it right
[44:55] there yes all right amen Joshua fought
[44:59] for every inch of ground from one end of
[45:02] the country to the other but he had a
[45:04] promise from God I'll give it to you
[45:07] whether there's Giants whether there's
[45:08] atheist whether there's infidels whether
[45:10] there's cold former churches what
[45:12] differences make God give me the promise
[45:15] let's go take it it's ours it belongs to
[45:17] us it's our possession let's go get it
[45:20] don't be afraid don't look back and say
[45:22] well I don't know don't do that don't
[45:24] look that don't look like a child of
[45:26] Abraham no matter how far along the
[45:28] promise seemed to hold out well it went
[45:30] for 25 years but instead of Abraham
[45:33] getting weaker he got stronger all the
[45:36] time how many children of Abraham are
[45:38] here amen the promise seems to be
[45:41] lengthening out and going out I never
[45:43] dreamed we'd be in 2024 but we're not
[45:46] going to get weaker we're going to get
[45:48] stronger we're not going to believe less
[45:50] we're going to believe
[45:53] more Hallelujah that's why I believe
[45:55] we'll see more healing and more
[45:57] deliverances and more salvations why
[46:00] because we're not getting weaker we're
[46:02] getting
[46:05] stronger well this one is leaving and
[46:08] that one is leaving so did Lot leave
[46:09] Abraham but that didn't make him weaker
[46:12] that made him
[46:15] stronger
[46:17] amen got stronger all the time for you
[46:20] knew it'd be a greater Miracle all the
[46:22] time you know we'll be prayed for one
[46:25] night you know the next day we'll say
[46:27] well maybe I never got
[46:29] anything I need to go through that line
[46:32] again no you need to
[46:36] believe amen you need to believe oh you
[46:40] and he said oh you call yourself a child
[46:42] of
[46:43] Abraham he said if God made a promise
[46:46] God give the promise and you believe it
[46:48] I don't care what takes place it's
[46:52] yours fight the devil on every ounce of
[46:55] ground he stands Zone and walk over
[46:58] there and take it with the sword of the
[47:00] word amen it's time that we quit letting
[47:03] the devil cish back off of what God did
[47:06] for us amen we go to a youth camp and we
[47:09] get an experience or we come to a church
[47:10] service and we get a moment with God
[47:12] don't go out the next day and say it
[47:14] never happened or I don't know if it no
[47:16] you take your sword and you fight the
[47:18] devil no matter what's going
[47:22] on God promises are true nothing can
[47:26] stop them there God
[47:28] promises amen I may make a promise and
[47:31] may not be able to fulfill it but God
[47:32] cannot do
[47:34] that Hallelujah he gave us the promise
[47:38] of that just like he did the children of
[47:40] Israel he said the Pentecostal church
[47:42] has come to their Kadesh Baria are we
[47:44] able can we do it well if the Pentecost
[47:47] came to that so will the message come to
[47:49] that can we do it Jesus Christ the same
[47:52] yesterday today and forever can we walk
[47:54] up there and take a hold of God's
[47:56] promises and say it's truth I claim it I
[47:59] own it it's mine God gave it to me how
[48:01] you going to do it I don't know it's
[48:03] none of my
[48:05] business it's up to God it's up to me to
[48:08] believe amen he said like I was
[48:10] preaching one time on Elijah a man came
[48:12] to me after servant said well wait a
[48:14] minute preacher I believe you're a man
[48:16] more sane man than actually believe that
[48:17] some crows brought Elijah fish and
[48:21] bread some reason the devil gets stirred
[48:23] up when you start preaching about birds
[48:27] he gets mad about that but that's okay
[48:28] we don't
[48:30] care inside thing
[48:32] sorry but he said I believe every word
[48:35] of it he said matter of fact the fish
[48:38] was fried and the bread was
[48:41] cooked he said how do you know tell me
[48:44] how how that happened he said I was a
[48:46] Jehovah's Witness said that tell me how
[48:48] how do the crows get to fry some bread
[48:50] or fry some fish and bake some bread he
[48:52] said that's not for me to
[48:54] question it wasn't for Elijah to
[48:56] question the only thing he knew when he
[48:59] got the sandwich it was good to
[49:02] eat and he said the same thing about the
[49:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost I can't tell
[49:06] you where it may come from or how it
[49:08] gets there I but I know it comes and I
[49:11] enjoy it that's all I care
[49:14] about he said I can't tell you how
[49:17] Divine Healing Works neither can I tell
[49:19] you how a black cow can eat gr Green
[49:22] Grass and give white milk but I drink it
[49:25] anyhow I don't try to make a formula out
[49:28] of it I don't know what causes the Holy
[49:30] Ghost to fall in a meeting and people
[49:32] speak in tongues and
[49:34] prophesy cripples jump up from
[49:36] wheelchairs sick get healed I can't tell
[49:39] you all of that but one thing I know God
[49:41] has promised it it's our possession
[49:44] let's take it and go with
[49:47] it it's
[49:51] ours but that's where that's where
[49:54] Israel made their mistake that's where
[49:55] Pentecost made their mistake mistake
[49:57] they come to the Judgment seat and
[49:59] brought back the evidence of a good
[50:02] land Pentecost actually had in their
[50:04] hands the evidence of a good land
[50:07] talking about isus Street the whole
[50:08] movement that come up to to through
[50:11] through the through the time and they
[50:12] had that but what did they want they
[50:14] wanted their denominations they wanted
[50:16] their man Creeds and their
[50:19] dogmas all they joyed the healing they
[50:22] enjoyed watching all that happen but
[50:24] they didn't want nothing to do with that
[50:25] word that's right and that's exactly
[50:28] where every Christian comes
[50:31] to come on somebody got quiet all of a
[50:35] sudden for some reason but it's exactly
[50:37] where every Christian comes to we might
[50:39] enjoy certain aspects of the church we
[50:41] might enjoy being around each other and
[50:43] music or this that and the other and we
[50:45] might enjoy a few things that happen but
[50:47] when it comes to the
[50:49] word and the word brings correction what
[50:52] are we going to do about then
[50:58] it's a judgment
[51:00] seat he said I'm so glad that there were
[51:03] people years ago who approached through
[51:05] all the formalities and went up and
[51:06] possessed the land and got the evidence
[51:08] and come back that there's a land beyond
[51:10] the river I'm so glad of that they made
[51:12] their fatal mistake when they begin to
[51:15] murmur against Moses and against God's
[51:17] servant and against God by and it
[51:19] bypassed them and remember every one of
[51:22] them that murmured never went into the
[51:23] land Jesus said when he was on Earth
[51:25] your fathers did eat Mana in the
[51:27] wilderness but there everyone
[51:29] dead and you look into that that means
[51:32] eternally separated from God everyone
[51:34] dead right I am the bread of life that
[51:36] came from God out of Heaven that a man
[51:38] can eat thereof and not die oh I like
[51:40] that pass from death into life become a
[51:42] new creature carnality cut off their
[51:45] spiritual
[51:47] Supply carnality cut off all their joy
[51:52] and they begin murmuring and fussing and
[51:54] they looked them off and it took them
[51:56] off in the desert if anything I hate is
[51:58] a desert now that's a prophet I'm sorry
[52:00] if anything I hate is a desert it's hot
[52:03] there's nobody hardly can live there
[52:05] everybody you get against in the desert
[52:06] got sticker everything's got stickers on
[52:09] it every kind of little old Vines got
[52:12] stickers on it is because there's no
[52:14] water there he said but if you'll bring
[52:17] them to where the water is it'll come
[52:19] out and bring a Tender Leaf amen will
[52:22] come into a water place he said so
[52:24] what's the matter with a lot of churches
[52:26] the reason they fuss and quarrel and
[52:28] stew and so-called Christians cuz
[52:30] they've been bypassed from the land of
[52:32] the blessing oh
[52:35] my from the fountain that never runs dry
[52:38] from The Rock in the weary land and they
[52:41] come dry and
[52:47] carnal they begin to murmur about this
[52:49] and murmur about that and mad about this
[52:52] and mad about that why because they're
[52:54] carnal that's why listen Church ain't
[52:57] all about
[52:59] you but we should all be about
[53:03] church amen listen it ain't all about me
[53:05] it ain't all about these brothers it
[53:07] ain't all about you individually but all
[53:09] of us together and God that's what it's
[53:11] about it's all about
[53:14] him that's why we gather together that's
[53:16] why we sacrifice and come on a Wednesday
[53:19] night it's not so I can be tickled and
[53:21] petted and and all these things and pred
[53:23] up and gushed no sir it's about him
[53:33] they had left the garlic pots of Egypt
[53:35] to eat Angel's food and was
[53:37] complaining they left the Muddy Waters
[53:39] of Egypt to drink from that spiritual
[53:41] war Rock and still complaining they left
[53:45] the boasting Physicians of Egypt to be
[53:48] with a great physician even their
[53:50] clothes didn't get threadbear there
[53:51] wasn't a feeble one among them and still
[53:55] complaining then they they left the
[53:57] people that said the days of Miracles
[53:59] have passed to be with the people that
[54:00] got signs following the Believers still
[54:03] complaining isn't that the same today we
[54:05] come out of the old cold formal stuff
[54:07] get the Holy Ghost and God fills you
[54:09] with goodness and you're drinking from
[54:11] the fountain that never runs dry all of
[54:13] them things they're joy unspeakable and
[54:15] full of glory and then go to complaining
[54:17] it's just the same thing first thing you
[54:19] know you're bypassed off into the desert
[54:22] somewhere that's the way God does things
[54:27] the way people today when fear strikes
[54:29] them when they're right in the path of
[54:31] Duty if you're but he said he said let
[54:34] listen to
[54:35] this he said if you're walking in the
[54:38] light having fellowship with God and
[54:41] with his people and the Holy Spirit is
[54:42] upon you and you meet an obstacle right
[54:44] in the path of Duty don't
[54:48] stop just keep pressing
[54:51] on God Will Make A Way through it that's
[54:55] one of the great experiences of my life
[54:56] is to seek God when I can't get over it
[54:58] under it around it or anyway God opens
[55:01] up a way and I go through it somehow or
[55:03] another his grace is always
[55:07] sufficient so no matter the
[55:09] circumstances keep walking no matter the
[55:12] symptoms still believe no matter how
[55:15] many critics rise up in what they say we
[55:19] have a job to
[55:20] do we have a mission to complete we're
[55:23] walking to a body change
[55:27] Satan does everything he can to try to
[55:29] make you stop for just a
[55:33] moment because if he knows you he has
[55:36] you stopped he knows you're no longer
[55:40] possessing cuz footsteps are
[55:44] possession not standing still footsteps

[57:13] get you to stop for just a minute he can
[57:16] make you reason it all out and he can
[57:18] make you think with your own
[57:21] mind but this is not what we're supposed
[57:23] to be thinking with we're supposed to
[57:25] have the mind of Christ
[57:27] Christ This Is What Makes Us different
[57:29] this is what makes us talk different act
[57:31] different walk different it's cuz we're
[57:33] not walking according to our own
[57:35] thoughts our own ability we're walking
[57:37] according to the mind of
[57:40] Christ but the devil wants to do you
[57:42] like Eve stop for a minute but he says
[57:45] don't you pay any attention to
[57:48] him keep your eyes on Christ your ears
[57:52] on the word and keep

[58:28] going you said the devil say well you
[58:31] know what you know so and so when they
[58:33] got the Holy Ghost remember they almost
[58:35] lost their mind don't even speak to them
[58:37] keep going on you don't know about so
[58:39] and so it's you and
[58:42] God come on somebody it ain't you and so
[58:46] and
[58:47] so so it's time we get out of so and
[58:49] so's business and make it between us and
[58:52] God church is not about so and so it's
[58:56] about you and God your walk is not about
[58:59] so and so it's about you and
[59:06] God well you just ain't heard what I
[59:09] heard don't even speak to
[59:14] him no matter what the critics say you
[59:17] got to expect that they're fulfilling
[59:22] scripture direct quotes don't listen to
[59:25] it keep your up your just close up your
[59:28] ears and go
[59:32] on you know brother brandom got turned
[59:34] around very familiar story
[59:38] wonderful got turned around out one time
[59:41] hunting and you know by his own wisdom
[59:44] and his own knowledge he found himself
[59:46] on what he called an Indian death
[59:49] walk and he found himself just going
[59:51] around going around in the circle till
[59:52] you
[59:54] die everything in him wanted to just
[59:56] stop and maybe hold up in a place and
[59:59] wait out let the storm pass but if he
[1:00:02] stopped his wife and his child was going
[1:00:04] to
[1:00:05] die and so he was trying though to walk
[1:00:09] on his own abilities and he had great
[1:00:12] abilities as far as a Woodsman he'd been
[1:00:13] in it all his life he'd trapped from a
[1:00:15] little boy no doubt knew exactly how to
[1:00:17] read things and in the Moss and this
[1:00:19] that and the other and had the snow was
[1:00:21] fall everything he knew he knew but this
[1:00:24] wasn't God was teaching himself
[1:00:26] something this wasn't about his own
[1:00:28] abilities this was about Allowing God to
[1:00:31] show him the way and trust him no matter
[1:00:33] what amen he found himself in this place
[1:00:36] and he found himself you know walking
[1:00:38] and he well I'm going to go this way and
[1:00:40] I'm going to set myself and he take off
[1:00:42] and he'd come back that was the same
[1:00:43] tree again well I'm going to do I'm
[1:00:46] going to set and he walk and he same
[1:00:48] tree same tree same tree same spot same
[1:00:53] spot
[1:00:56] come on like a lot of people in their
[1:00:58] lives never can't get to Victory cuz
[1:01:01] they're coming right back around to the
[1:01:02] same place right back around the same
[1:01:05] why cuz they're trying to walk in their
[1:01:07] own thinking and their own knowledge and
[1:01:08] their own abilities and how they think
[1:01:10] they can get themselves out of the deal
[1:01:13] amen it ain't about how you can get
[1:01:14] yourself out of anything it's about what
[1:01:17] God can do and he began to hear this
[1:01:20] voice speaking and said I'm the
[1:01:21] everpresent help in the time of
[1:01:24] trouble oh oh God let that voice speak
[1:01:27] to somebody tonight that I'm the
[1:01:29] everpresent help he wasn't just a help
[1:01:31] on that mountain he's a help tonight on
[1:01:34] a Wednesday night he can come to your
[1:01:36] Pew and where you're at you might feel
[1:01:38] like you've been in the death walk it's
[1:01:41] called you've been walking on your own
[1:01:42] abilities but if you'll start listening
[1:01:44] to that voice and cast down your
[1:01:47] reasoning God will take
[1:01:49] [Applause]
[1:01:51] over and here he is walking exactly the
[1:01:54] wrong direction and all of a sudden he
[1:01:56] said I felt a little tap on my
[1:01:59] shoulder oh God yes Lord tap somebody
[1:02:03] tonight
[1:02:04] Lord and He Turned and he said all of a
[1:02:07] sudden I turned around he said when I
[1:02:08] did the fog had been pushed back and he
[1:02:11] said I got a glimpse of Hurricane
[1:02:13] Mountain and he said I was headed
[1:02:15] exactly the wrong direction he said but
[1:02:18] God rich in Mercy pulled me back
[1:02:21] around I don't know about you but I'm
[1:02:23] thankful the prophet of God shared these
[1:02:25] kind of testimonies that he could show
[1:02:27] he was also a human and he also made
[1:02:30] mistakes and he also leaned on his own
[1:02:32] ability and his own understanding but
[1:02:34] God rich in Mercy turned him around and
[1:02:37] pointed him back in the right direction
[1:02:40] if God could do that to a prophet he can
[1:02:42] do that to you tonight you might have
[1:02:44] been on the wrong path going the wrong
[1:02:46] way but there's a tap coming on your
[1:02:49] shoulder through the word of almighty
[1:02:51] God and turning you around and the fog
[1:02:54] has been blowned back
[1:02:56] oh God let the wind of the spirit blow
[1:02:59] tonight and blow the fog back and we can
[1:03:02] catch a glimpse not of Hurrican Mountain
[1:03:05] but of
[1:03:06] [Applause]
[1:03:11] Calvary and he said I knew between me
[1:03:14] and that mountain was a line I'd put up
[1:03:17] and he said I didn't know what else to
[1:03:18] do but throw up my
[1:03:21] [Music]
[1:03:22] hands there's a reason why that song got
[1:03:24] some power in it yeah so I throw up my
[1:03:28] hands and praise you again and
[1:03:32] again why you know may not feel like it
[1:03:35] he didn't feel like it either he said
[1:03:37] there was times one of his hand got so
[1:03:38] tired he just had to pull one up and put
[1:03:40] another one up but he's going to keep a
[1:03:42] hand up cuz he said if I miss that wire
[1:03:45] I miss my opportunity right why did he
[1:03:49] not stop because there were lives at
[1:03:51] stake there was somebody down in that
[1:03:53] cabin that was worth saving
[1:03:59] yeah oh my all of a sudden he said I
[1:04:02] stopped for a moment he said that's the
[1:04:04] way it is just a rest he said but I
[1:04:06] wouldn't move until I got another hand
[1:04:08] up and he said when I got that hand up

[1:07:21] to fulfill the word spoken of him
[1:07:26] so you will also have to fulfill the

[1:08:05] wouldn't those who could see though
[1:08:08] there was one who kept a steady look
[1:08:11] towards heaven walking
[1:08:15] on he didn't even hear it he was too big
[1:08:20] to hear
[1:08:21] it that's right big men don't notice
[1:08:24] nonsense like that they just ignore it
[1:08:27] they know the resource from where it
[1:08:30] comes Mercy
[1:08:32] Jesus I thought these were men no these
[1:08:35] were
[1:08:36] Spirits crying out in men and it's
[1:08:39] exactly the same thing we see in
[1:08:42] today amen they they just ignore it they
[1:08:46] know the resource which it comes from
[1:08:48] they go on Jesus had one thing to do he
[1:08:51] had one job to do and that was to do the
[1:08:54] will of the father that was always in
[1:08:56] his heart and in his
[1:08:59] mind and any other man that's anointed
[1:09:02] of God is too big to listen to
[1:09:04] criticisms and things like that they
[1:09:06] don't they have one job to do that's
[1:09:09] obey
[1:09:11] God God will take care of the rest just
[1:09:15] watch what happens to that type of crowd
[1:09:17] what if we could rise out of Rise them
[1:09:19] out of hell tonight what would they do
[1:09:22] he said I imagine we'd be an
[1:09:24] oldfashioned alter call sure enough but
[1:09:26] they
[1:09:27] can't their attitude towards the Son of
[1:09:30] God sealed their
[1:09:32] destination and your attitude towards
[1:09:35] him tonight will do the same thing for
[1:09:38] you he either bring him in or seal him
[1:09:43] out wow but watch him he marched he
[1:09:48] walked on the whole world every sin that
[1:09:51] was committed from Adam to the last
[1:09:53] mortal that live on earth laid on his
[1:09:55] his
[1:09:56] shoulders but he wouldn't
[1:09:58] stop why cuz there were lives at
[1:10:03] stake if he stopped you wouldn't have a
[1:10:06] chance that's right if he said I can't
[1:10:10] do it you would be without hope I would
[1:10:14] be without hope there's lives that stake
[1:10:17] what's Jesus doing he's got his eyes set
[1:10:20] to Calvary he's going right straight to
[1:10:22] Jerusalem to be offered up for a
[1:10:24] sacrifice the weight of every sin that
[1:10:26] was ever committed on Earth or ever
[1:10:29] would be committed rested upon his
[1:10:31] precious shoulders shoulders he was a
[1:10:33] big
[1:10:34] man when people say bad things about you
[1:10:37] if you can just go on and forget it that
[1:10:40] shows you are a big
[1:10:43] man little men can't tamper with it that
[1:10:46] he was too big to listen to their
[1:10:48] criticism he had one thing to do that's
[1:10:51] the father's will he had to die for
[1:10:53] those men
[1:10:56] yes so he kept his face toward Calvary
[1:10:59] and kept
[1:11:00] walking see fa Faith it's I'm about to
[1:11:04] read one of my favorite quotes and I've
[1:11:06] used it before but I'm going to use it
[1:11:07] again faith is
[1:11:10] unconscious you got faith sometimes and
[1:11:12] don't even know
[1:11:14] it Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a
[1:11:16] storm or a gale knocking the boat one
[1:11:18] side or the other he standing in the fa
[1:11:19] face of a mess of demons if he was
[1:11:22] hanging anywhere and never moved he
[1:11:23] walked right on just as calm and quiet
[1:11:25] as he could be he was simply unconscious
[1:11:28] of fear or anything around him whether
[1:11:30] it was going to happen whether it's not
[1:11:31] going to happen he knew it was going to
[1:11:32] happen because God said it was going to
[1:11:34] happen he didn't say I wonder if I
[1:11:36] prayed through wonder if I fasted long
[1:11:37] enough wonder if I did this he walked
[1:11:39] right on unconscious he believed what
[1:11:42] God Said was the truth the words must be
[1:11:44] fulfilled and he knew what his life was
[1:11:46] sent to to do to fulfill them and you
[1:11:49] are here to fulfill it too and you are
[1:11:53] here to fulfill it too so just walk
[1:11:55] unconscious to
[1:11:58] fear walk unconscious to fear walk
[1:12:01] unconscious of criticism walk
[1:12:03] unconscious to the world what do you
[1:12:05] mean unconscious in other words you're
[1:12:06] so out of tune with what they're saying
[1:12:09] and what they're doing you never heard
[1:12:13] them don't look like don't look at me
[1:12:16] like you don't do that you do do that
[1:12:18] put a phone in your
[1:12:20] face you be we become unconscious to all
[1:12:24] kinds of things the house could be blown
[1:12:27] away daddy the house is on
[1:12:30] fire we don't hear things why we're
[1:12:33] unconscious to it cuz we're zoned into
[1:12:37] something come on somebody and I'm not
[1:12:39] saying what you're looking at it's all
[1:12:41] together bad I hope it
[1:12:43] ain't amen but but what is it if you'll
[1:12:46] get zoned into what we're here to
[1:12:48] fulfill if you'll get so tuned into what
[1:12:51] we're here to do and why we're here on
[1:12:53] this Earth we're not here to just have a
[1:12:55] church and have a few good songs and a
[1:12:58] couple of sermons here and there live a
[1:13:00] life and die no sir we are here for a
[1:13:02] body change we are here to see the dead
[1:13:05] in Christ rise we are here to see God
[1:13:08] move in the most miraculous way he's
[1:13:10] ever moved since the beginning of earth
[1:13:12] when dead will rise again and become
[1:13:15] flesh and the immortal immort
[1:13:18] immortality will take on immortality and
[1:13:20] gray hair will come back to a normal
[1:13:22] color again and broken bones and
[1:13:25] withered up hands and withered up legs
[1:13:27] and withered up feet will all be perfect
[1:13:29] again and there won't be no mind battles
[1:13:31] there won't be nothing left of the devil
[1:13:33] no more it'll be all over and happiness
[1:13:36] and pure and goodness of God flowing
[1:13:39] everywhere that is where we're about to
[1:13:41] step
[1:13:42] into so if we got all that in front of
[1:13:44] us why we worried about a little critic
[1:13:47] why we worried about some nonsense the
[1:13:48] devil got to say to him out and listen
[1:13:51] to what God has
[1:13:58] walk unconscious to criticism walk
[1:14:01] unconscious to the world walk as you
[1:14:04] walk in Christ walk with him not paying
[1:14:05] any attention to the right or the left
[1:14:07] just moving on if something comes to the
[1:14:10] church up in the church walk with

[1:19:47] pit praying day and night and day and
[1:19:50] night getting a little rest getting back
[1:19:52] up and
[1:19:53] praying people standing there in the
[1:19:56] rain why were they doing that because
[1:20:00] lives were at
[1:20:01] stake they just kept taking another step
[1:20:04] kept taking another step to finally
[1:20:06] maybe they had the opportunity to step
[1:20:08] right there before him what if they'
[1:20:11] gave up just around the
[1:20:14] corner what if they had just quit and
[1:20:17] went

[1:20:29] ambulance driver and he said I got a
[1:20:32] patient out here's dying can you come
[1:20:33] see her just the night before a man that
[1:20:36] had a shoe cober up in the city of

[1:20:40] when he passed to the line the Holy
[1:20:41] Spirit told him about his conditions and
[1:20:43] pronounced him healed well he left the
[1:20:45] building blind left the building he
[1:20:47] could not see any more than he did when
[1:20:49] he came in the building but he knew I
[1:20:51] did not know him and there was some sort
[1:20:52] of Supernatural being speak it
[1:20:55] because he knew I know nothing of him
[1:20:57] and he accepted that person not me the
[1:21:00] one that was speaking the story was they
[1:21:02] threw it on the radio the next morning
[1:21:03] across the country that on this on his
[1:21:05] road home that night about 2:00 in the
[1:21:07] morning he be to see the lights of the
[1:21:09] cars flickering in front of him next
[1:21:12] morning he rushed into his own church
[1:21:13] the Methodist Church and he caused such
[1:21:15] a disturbance till he was throwed out
[1:21:18] then down the street he went from one
[1:21:19] Church to another to testify it caused
[1:21:21] quite a commotion many of the people
[1:21:24] would come from the hospitals and we're
[1:21:25] waiting to be prayed for and we walked
[1:21:27] out followed this ambulance driver out
[1:21:29] and he said it was into an ambulance it
[1:21:31] was a typical Arkansa mother laying
[1:21:33] there dying with cancer and her husband
[1:21:35] thought maybe that she was dead look
[1:21:38] maybe I don't know maybe she was in a
[1:21:40] com Comer he didn't know exactly she was
[1:21:42] laying
[1:21:43] quietly knelt down the back of the Hamet
[1:21:45] with the driver put me and brother he
[1:21:47] said brother bradam she long so much for
[1:21:49] you to pray for her she's a good woman
[1:21:51] she's there to help me farm and mother
[1:21:53] of five children have sold my farm and
[1:21:56] last thing we sold was our team and the
[1:21:58] doctors have fought Faithfully to save
[1:22:00] her life but she was given up and sent
[1:22:01] home and to get an amulet to bring us
[1:22:03] down she sold her blackberries we'd
[1:22:05] canned two years ago to get money to
[1:22:07] come and now she's been laying quiet
[1:22:09] she's
[1:22:10] dead and I took a hold of her hand she
[1:22:13] knelt down in his old in his old patched
[1:22:16] shirt faded out and I prayed just a
[1:22:17] little prayer and I thought i' seen the
[1:22:20] wrinkles of her forehead kindly frown
[1:22:23] and Satan said to me of course of course
[1:22:25] you know that's just a reaction of the
[1:22:26] muscles she's
[1:22:29] dead but I continued to
[1:22:35] pray her hand gripped mine like that and
[1:22:38] Satan said it's just the muscles and I
[1:22:41] continued to
[1:22:42] pray in a few moments she raised up and
[1:22:45] she said who are you and her whole
[1:22:48] husband so overcome by bringing life
[1:22:50] again to his sweet wife threw his arms
[1:22:52] around and began to scream mama I
[1:22:54] slipped out the door of the Hamlet I
[1:22:56] said can you get me back to the platform
[1:22:57] he said there's 2,000 people between
[1:22:59] here and that door I'll take you around
[1:23:01] the back of the parking lot and see if I
[1:23:03] can make a way that way they go around a
[1:23:05] different way and he said all that was
[1:23:06] just to show that God will respect those
[1:23:09] who hunger and thirst for
[1:23:11] righteousness he said when we got to
[1:23:13] where the line of the chartered buses
[1:23:15] was I heard a noise and I looked it was
[1:23:18] a young colored girl nicely dressed in
[1:23:20] AR in Arkansas in those days it was
[1:23:22] strict segregation and she was F and she
[1:23:25] was trying to find her way around and
[1:23:27] she was calling out Papa where are you
[1:23:29] papa feeling a harm but she just kept
[1:23:32] walking Papa where are you want to help
[1:23:34] somebody help me find my papa but she
[1:23:36] just kept
[1:23:38] walking crying out he said I just went
[1:23:41] over there and stood for a moment no one
[1:23:43] knew me cuz I I've been in that place
[1:23:45] all the time the temple there and they
[1:23:46] couldn't even get in there so nobody
[1:23:48] knew who I was somebody please help me
[1:23:50] find my papa and she just kept moving
[1:23:53] through the crowd stumbling through and
[1:23:54] I thought of old blind Anna in the
[1:23:56] Temple when she had prayed so long and
[1:23:58] waited for the consolation of Israel and
[1:24:00] they brought our Lord into the temple to
[1:24:02] do for him the custom of the law and the
[1:24:04] Holy Spirit Led that blind woman to
[1:24:06] where he was so I stood there for a
[1:24:09] moment and she finally staggered right
[1:24:11] into
[1:24:12] me and she said pardon me and she
[1:24:15] started to go again I said who are you

[1:24:30] told me to be and I can't find him and I
[1:24:32] I if you'll just help me to the bus

[1:35:19] but here he
[1:35:21] is so happy to see you I thought I'm I'm
[1:35:23] not dreaming I can see these people I
[1:35:25] can see my body laying there so you know
[1:35:28] it's written in the Bible that prophets
[1:35:29] are gathered with their people and yes I
[1:35:31] remember that in the scriptures there's
[1:35:33] not this many Brams though they said
[1:35:34] these are not Brams these are your
[1:35:36] converts the one you led to the Lord
[1:35:38] some of these women you think are so
[1:35:39] beautiful were more than 90 years old
[1:35:42] when you led them to the
[1:35:44] Lord Joe I I think about that and I
[1:35:46] think about that old tug boat captain
[1:35:49] your uncle We buried in the name of the
[1:35:52] Lord Jesus Christ how old was he 70
[1:35:55] something around
[1:35:57] there lived his life serving
[1:36:03] God it's worth
[1:36:06] it it's worth all the
[1:36:08] criticisms it's worth all the stuff
[1:36:10] people want to say I it's worth it if
[1:36:14] one soul will walk down the aisle it's
[1:36:17] worth every struggle is worth every
[1:36:20] mile I said well where is Jesus I want
[1:36:22] to see him he a little higher but
[1:36:24] someday he'll come to you you sent as a
[1:36:27] leader when God comes he will judge you
[1:36:29] according to your teaching I said does
[1:36:31] Paul and Peter have to stand the
[1:36:32] Judgment also and I said the answer was
[1:36:34] yes I preached what they preached I did
[1:36:38] not divert from one side of the other
[1:36:40] where they baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:36:42] I did too where they taught the baptism
[1:36:44] of the spirit I did too whatever they
[1:36:46] taught I taught and the people cried we
[1:36:49] know that we're resting on it we know
[1:36:53] that that we're going back to Earth with
[1:36:54] you sometime and Jesus will come and
[1:36:56] judge you according to the words you
[1:36:58] preached to us then he will present you
[1:37:00] will present us to him and all together
[1:37:02] we'll go back to the Earth and live
[1:37:04] forever I said do I have to go back to
[1:37:06] Earth now second
[1:37:08] time yes but keep pressing
[1:37:12] on I begin to move from that beautiful
[1:37:15] joyful place and far as my eye could see
[1:37:18] people were coming towards me to embrace
[1:37:20] me cry my precious brother and suddenly
[1:37:22] I was back in the the bed again I said
[1:37:24] oh God help me never let me compromise
[1:37:28] with the word let me stay straight on
