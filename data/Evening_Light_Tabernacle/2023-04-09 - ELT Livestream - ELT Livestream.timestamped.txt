[44:39] Lord's given me some inspiration to to
[44:41] speak to you today I the Lord had dealt
[44:44] with me a few weeks ago I was at a camp
[44:46] in Oklahoma and the Lord had dealt with
[44:48] me to speak on the thought of worship
[44:50] Warriors
[44:51] and uh how many was in that camp there
[44:55] a few of you
[44:57] nah the Lord give me give me some
[45:00] inspiration and uh
[45:02] and I just I'd like to speak to you
[45:04] today
[45:06] I was in this prayer line the Lord dealt
[45:08] with me what to speak to you this
[45:09] morning
[45:10] on worship without shackles
[45:14] worship without shackles and
[45:17] I feel like we've seen some shackles
[45:19] fall off and
[45:21] maybe if you have your Bible this
[45:23] morning we'll turn over the Book of
[45:24] Revelation
[45:26] chapter one and then to chapter five
[45:28] there
[45:30] I want to again thank brother Tim and
[45:32] evening like Tabernacle for inviting us
[45:35] to come and
[45:38] come and be a part of these meetings
[45:40] once again and
[45:41] it's an honor to
[45:48] it's an honor to stand here
[45:52] to watch my dad
[45:57] That was supposed to be an agree by now
[46:04] tell you that Easter is real
[46:08] so I believe that's why I can worship
[46:09] without shackles
[46:12] because Easter proved
[46:14] that the grave didn't have enough
[46:19] you love the Lord this morning
[46:23] before we read brother Branham said in a
[46:25] restoration of the Bright Tree he said
[46:26] that's Easter time he said oh I like
[46:29] Eastern yes sir but there's too much on
[46:30] Easter today about bunny rabbits and
[46:32] ducks and pink chickens and pretty hats
[46:35] and new dresses he said that's not
[46:36] Easter
[46:37] but Easter is the resurrection it's
[46:39] restoring to restore back its God
[46:42] restoring time it's God restoring time
[46:46] you look over you look out over the
[46:49] Earth God is restoring restoring what
[46:51] nature that's right he's restoring the
[46:53] flowers he's restoring the leaves he's
[46:55] restoring the fruit of the field what is
[46:57] it it's God is restoring it's Easter
[47:00] means to bring it back
[47:02] what is it there is a sentence Acclaim
[47:05] Easter crime
[47:06] or the flower claims it has a right to
[47:09] rise again and God's law nature pulls
[47:11] the Earth around and makes the law of
[47:12] God and nature bring forth an Easter a
[47:15] resurrection it's beautiful
[47:18] Revelations chapter 1 and verse 17
[47:21] and when I saw him I fell at his feet
[47:25] as dead and he laid his right hand upon
[47:28] me saying unto me fear not I am the
[47:30] first and the last
[47:32] I am he that liveth and was deed dead
[47:35] and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen
[47:39] and I have the keys of hell and of death
[47:44] Revelation chapter 5 and verse 8.
[47:52] Revelations chapter 5 and verse 8 and
[47:54] brother Branham little Branham said in
[47:56] Gabriel's instructions to Daniel he said
[47:58] I like to worship don't you
[48:01] and we don't come to church just to hear
[48:03] a sermon that goes with it but we come
[48:05] to church to worship Worship in spirit
[48:08] and in truth you've heard the truth
[48:09] that's the word now to worship is to
[48:12] express yourself to him
[48:15] and Lord spoke to me a little bit ago
[48:18] and he spoke to me said
[48:25] I'll give you everything in life
[48:28] but worship is what we give back to him
[48:31] it's the only thing
[48:33] it's the only thing that he didn't give
[48:35] us that we can give back to him
[48:37] so let's give it back to him
[48:40] Revelations 5 and 8 and when he had
[48:42] taken the book The Four beasts and Four
[48:44] and Twenty Elders fell down before the
[48:45] lamb having every one of them Harps and
[48:47] golden vials full of odors which are the
[48:50] prayers of saints and they sung a new
[48:52] song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the
[48:54] book and to open the seals thereof for
[48:56] thou was slain and has redeemed us to
[48:58] God by thy blood out of every Kindred
[49:01] and tongue and people and nation and
[49:04] that's made us unto our God the Kings
[49:06] and Priests let's say that together
[49:07] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[49:10] the earth and I beheld and I heard the
[49:12] voice of many angels round about the
[49:14] throne and the Beast and the elders and
[49:16] the number of them was ten thousands
[49:18] times ten thousands and thousands of
[49:20] thousands saying with a loud voice
[49:22] Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
[49:25] receive power and riches and wisdom and
[49:27] strength and honor and glory and
[49:29] blessing and every creature which is in
[49:32] heaven and on Earth and under the Earth
[49:33] and such as are in the sea and all that
[49:36] are in them heard eyes saying blessing
[49:39] and honor and Glory free and power be
[49:41] unto him that setteth upon the throne
[49:43] and the lamb forever and ever and the
[49:46] four beasts said amen and the Four and
[49:49] Twenty Elders fell down and worshiped
[49:51] him that liveth forever
[49:54] and ever may God bless his word he may
[49:57] be seated in the presence of the Lord as
[49:58] we said we'd like to speak to you just
[50:00] for a few moments this morning on
[50:02] worship without shackles worship without
[50:04] child girls and Jesus said that he said
[50:07] the hour cometh and now is when the true
[50:10] worshipers shall worship the father in
[50:12] spirit and in the truth for the father
[50:15] seeketh such to worship him so we
[50:17] recognize that God is a spirit and they
[50:20] that worship Him have got to worship Him
[50:23] in spirit and in truth and you know good
[50:26] and well that that we serve an amazing
[50:28] God that has filled your life has
[50:30] changed your mind he's he's changed your
[50:32] heart he's changed you he's healed you
[50:34] he's made you whole and he knows how to
[50:37] speak to us upon our current life crisis
[50:39] that we are in and he doesn't speak to
[50:41] us about our problems but he speak to us
[50:44] about his promises and he knows exactly
[50:46] where we are and he knows exactly where
[50:49] he is taking us to he's not taking us
[50:51] under defeat but he is taking us unto
[50:54] completely Victory and he reveals
[50:55] himself in truth so that he can be
[50:57] worshiped in truth so today we are not
[51:00] serving a God that has lied to us and
[51:02] has ever let down on any of his promises
[51:04] but we are worship him a God that knows
[51:07] that he's going to keep his promise he
[51:09] knows that he's not going to let one of
[51:11] them fall and we recognize that we are
[51:13] serving a tangible God a God that can be
[51:16] failed a God that can be seen a God that
[51:18] you've witnessed and you've witnessed
[51:20] him come and touch you this weekend by
[51:23] the power of the Holy Ghost it was him
[51:25] and it came by your way and he touched
[51:27] your heart he's a tangible God and it
[51:30] can be felt by the feeling of our
[51:31] infirmities but I don't want to just
[51:33] talk to you about things of of things
[51:35] that that you've went through and things
[51:37] of your past but I want to speak to you
[51:39] from people that have the keys in their
[51:42] hand and have unlocked the chains off of
[51:44] their life and William Branham would
[51:46] speak from a message of Jeremiah 8 and
[51:48] 22 is there is there any balm and Gilead
[51:51] is there no physician there then why is
[51:53] the health of the daughter of my people
[51:56] why are they not recovered but notice
[51:59] notice he's saying to us that Jeremiah
[52:01] is saying to us why are you going down
[52:03] in there in the foreign lands is there
[52:05] not healing is there not virtuous
[52:07] they're not power right here but notice
[52:09] what brother random said in the message

[52:13] here to believe that inoculation do you
[52:16] believe it all right all of you believe
[52:18] it then stand upon your feet and receive
[52:20] your healing in the name of Jesus Christ

[55:28] pressure he said now that you have
[55:30] confessed your sins now

[55:37] that you believe do you believe that

[55:53] amen amen amen do you believe that you
[55:59] beat all the shackles off of your
[56:01] understanding

[56:37] defeated I will not go to a devil's
[56:39] grave I will not go to his hell hole no

[56:43] you cannot worship from where you was
[56:45] last week you've got to worship from the
[56:48] experience that you had in this Camp
[56:50] you've got to worship free you've got to
[56:53] worship when shackles off of you
[56:55] you can't worship when there's change on
[56:58] your life you can't sing take God I'm
[57:00] free as long as the chains are upon you
[57:02] but if the chains are off
[57:04] if the shackles have been broke you are
[57:07] worshiping from freedom and there is
[57:10] nobody that can worship like somebody
[57:12] that's been set free because there's a
[57:15] reason why you can sing you don't know
[57:17] like I know because you were the one
[57:19] that was locked up you were the one that
[57:21] the devil lied to and you recognize that
[57:24] he ain't got his hand on you no more
[57:25] you're free and then the sun is set free

[57:33] to our chains we're not going back to
[57:35] our prison sale we're not going back to
[57:37] it because our lord Jesus came with the
[57:40] keys in his hand
[57:41] [Applause]
[57:43] The Keeper of the keys is here
[57:52] tell the devil you ain't got the keys to
[57:54] your own house

[58:01] you can't put me back in that turtle's
[58:03] hell you can't put me back there where
[58:05] you held me I know what it's like to be
[58:07] free and if you ever tasted the Sweet
[58:10] Taste of Victory you'll never go back to
[58:13] living a bad life no more
[58:16] hallelujah we're not ashamed we know
[58:19] when we came out of and the same God
[58:21] that came there and tapped Peter on the
[58:24] sale when he was there in the prison
[58:26] cell was the same God that came to you
[58:28] this weekend and said it's time that you
[58:30] rise and shine
[58:32] because there was prayer made up there
[58:33] in John Mark's house and they were
[58:35] praying for brother Peter they were
[58:37] praying for him and while they were
[58:39] praying for him the angel that was
[58:41] directed by prayer went to Peter's
[58:44] prison
[58:45] notice a prayer didn't send him down
[58:47] over to Lucy's house or Susie's house
[58:49] but he sent him to Peter's house and
[58:52] there were some mamas that was praying
[58:53] there were some pastors that was praying
[58:55] and the angel came and woke you up and
[58:58] said it's time to get out of your
[59:00] shackles and it's time to worship you
[59:02] cannot look for the chains you cannot
[59:05] look at where you was you've got to look
[59:07] at where God is going to take you David
[59:10] could not look at Goliath's head because
[59:12] he was looking at the promises of God
[59:16] Promises of God are so big that you
[59:18] can't even see that washed up of a
[59:20] Giant's head because he know you know
[59:23] that God ain't never lost about
[59:26] can I just talk to you for a moment
[59:27] God's never lost a battle
[59:30] God's not intentioning he's not in the
[59:32] having any tensions that he's going to
[59:34] lose today if he won the victory two
[59:36] thousand years ago he's going to win the
[59:38] victory this morning
[59:40] is that right
[59:43] I will not go back to a devil's hell I
[59:47] will not go back to depression
[59:51] let's make some affirmations here this
[59:53] morning I will not go back to my prison
[59:55] house I will not go back to that dark
[59:57] cloud spirit I will not go back to that
[1:00:00] fear I will not go back to that
[1:00:02] mentality I will not go back to a slave
[1:00:05] mentality

[1:00:19] unto the Lord I cried till Jesus came
[1:00:23] and he made me whole I would not be
[1:00:27] denied

[1:00:32] a faith that said I'm not going to be
[1:00:34] denied I'm not going to this Camp just
[1:00:36] to have another Camp experience but I'm
[1:00:39] coming to meet a living God
[1:00:44] another random set an expectation he
[1:00:46] said when those little shackles and Dark
[1:00:48] Shadows get broke away then the Holy

[1:02:56] like television or radio it's passing
[1:02:59] through this room but you don't see it
[1:03:01] you don't see it but it's here he said
[1:03:03] all of those sound waves he said What It
[1:03:05] Takes he said it takes a channel that is
[1:03:07] opened up so that it can reach in there
[1:03:09] and it can catch the inspiration of
[1:03:11] where it's coming you can't see him but
[1:03:13] there's colors flying through here you
[1:03:15] can't see them right here but there are
[1:03:17] spirits that are leaving here you can't
[1:03:19] see it but there's a God of Abraham
[1:03:20] Isaac and Jacob that is here he's
[1:03:23] passing through this room he said but oh
[1:03:26] he said if there would be a great big
[1:03:27] banner that would pass through the room
[1:03:29] a thing that would it would say yes
[1:03:31] across it he said we couldn't see it
[1:03:33] until it got into a Channel of
[1:03:36] inspiration of television or radio so
[1:03:38] that we could pick it up but there's an
[1:03:40] inspiration that is here it's your faith
[1:03:43] and your faith is saying yes to the
[1:03:45] promises of God I am healed I am
[1:03:48] delivered I'm no longer pound yes and
[1:03:51] William Branham said he said when
[1:03:52] there's one thought he said one one says
[1:03:55] yes there's the power of one but when
[1:03:57] two say yes it's a power of two he said
[1:03:59] it's a double blessing then the power of
[1:04:01] three then the power of four yes yes but
[1:04:04] all if all of this building could say
[1:04:06] yes it's mine
[1:04:08] I am delivered yes
[1:04:12] yes it's passing through this room right
[1:04:15] now this ain't taking Stein this ain't
[1:04:18] Putin's time this ain't Biden's time
[1:04:20] this is our time the time is at hand
[1:04:23] this is the bright survival this is the
[1:04:26] Golden Age the shackles are rolled off
[1:04:28] of you
[1:04:30] remember when William Branham because
[1:04:32] they're in a prayer line in his early
[1:04:33] Ministry
[1:04:35] and it's there in a foreign land and
[1:04:37] there's a little girl that is sitting
[1:04:38] there that's got these braces on her leg
[1:04:41] remember she's sitting there she's
[1:04:42] waiting and brother Branham he's passing
[1:04:45] by
[1:04:46] and children have a very special spot
[1:04:49] there's there's never a child that I've
[1:04:51] ever prayed for and I could ever forget
[1:04:53] them
[1:04:54] children have a very special spot in our
[1:04:56] hearts
[1:04:58] but this little girl was sitting there
[1:04:59] and had these braces upon her leg
[1:05:01] she's sitting there
[1:05:03] as brother Brandon passed by she reached
[1:05:06] up and kissed his coat you remember she
[1:05:09] reached up and she kissed his coat and
[1:05:12] brother Branham said he said I turned
[1:05:14] around to her and said you're healed he
[1:05:15] said a vision broke and he said I've
[1:05:18] seen that she was healed he said but she
[1:05:20] couldn't understand me because of the
[1:05:22] language barrier
[1:05:24] because of the language barrier and he
[1:05:27] said they took me immediately he said in
[1:05:29] that night there was Miracle on top of
[1:05:30] Miracles he said they grabbed crutches
[1:05:32] armed full of crutches and they took
[1:05:34] them out of there but you see the vision
[1:05:36] had already spoke and the vision had got
[1:05:40] to come to pass because a vision can
[1:05:42] never fail you recognize that she'd come
[1:05:45] there with that Faith she reached out
[1:05:47] and she kissed the prophets coattail
[1:05:49] there as he passed by but the vision had
[1:05:51] already broke
[1:05:53] and maybe you don't understand because
[1:05:55] the language barrier maybe there's a
[1:05:58] laodicea barrier that's trying to keep
[1:06:01] you thinking that you're going to go
[1:06:03] back to that
[1:06:04] but a vision has already broke God's
[1:06:07] language is not that you go back God's
[1:06:10] languages that you be free
[1:06:14] William Branham said that he was sitting
[1:06:16] there and he was speaking through that
[1:06:17] interpreter and he said you only say
[1:06:19] what I say he said honey you are already
[1:06:23] healed
[1:06:25] said you go over there and you take
[1:06:27] those braces off and when those braces
[1:06:30] come off just raise your hand up and
[1:06:34] when you raise your hand up
[1:06:36] College
[1:06:40] oh why don't you lift up those hands
[1:06:42] that once held lower the feeble hands
[1:06:45] are once hung down you are not in
[1:06:47] shekels no more
[1:06:48] and when she lifted up her hand he said
[1:06:51] I heard a scream
[1:06:55] he said there she come running across
[1:06:58] that platform
[1:07:00] what was it the braces had come off the
[1:07:03] shackles had come off why don't you lift
[1:07:05] those hands you that's been set free
[1:07:07] you're that's been delivered
[1:07:10] why don't you let out a scream and said
[1:07:12] I am free I am to live first I am broke
[1:07:15] free that's not a language barrier
[1:07:17] between you and Papa God
[1:07:19] you know what he's saying to you
[1:07:24] God's language
[1:07:27] God's language used to throw down every
[1:07:29] devil
[1:07:30] his language is the cast down every evil
[1:07:32] spirit his language is to throw down
[1:07:34] Idols his language is that you'll be
[1:07:37] fret set free but his language is not
[1:07:40] just for the personal things that you'd
[1:07:42] have made of his language is for Rapture
[1:07:44] let me tell you if we don't go into
[1:07:47] Rapture this message is no good to us
[1:07:49] but if this message is wrong then all
[1:07:53] Christianity is wrong
[1:07:55] the angel is here to back up what the
[1:07:58] messenger said the language of the
[1:08:00] angels of the Angel is you are returned
[1:08:04] back
[1:08:06] he didn't give you a message of has
[1:08:07] frustration he gave you a message of
[1:08:10] full restoration you're not under a
[1:08:12] Luther worship you're not under a
[1:08:14] Wesleyan worship you're not under Azusa
[1:08:17] worship you are under the greatest
[1:08:19] restoration message that there ever has
[1:08:21] been every Every Chain has been broke
[1:08:24] off of it
[1:08:25] you're not worshiping from a closed book
[1:08:28] you're worshiping from an open book The
[1:08:30] Seals have been broke off our
[1:08:32] understanding is open we recognize the
[1:08:34] seals have been ripped off
[1:08:36] every devil that said he was going to
[1:08:39] destroy us is a liar
[1:08:42] the white horse rider that was riding in
[1:08:45] Revelations 5 we recognize that he is
[1:08:48] powerless
[1:08:49] you see because of our understanding of
[1:08:51] theologians they told us that that was
[1:08:53] our Lord up there riding on that white
[1:08:55] horse but when the seal broke forth
[1:08:58] he gave us an understanding that that
[1:09:00] was the Antichrist writing on that but
[1:09:02] what did William Bradham tell us he's
[1:09:04] riding up there he's got a bow but he
[1:09:07] ain't got no errors so the weapons that
[1:09:09] he's throwing that to have no effect on
[1:09:11] you because your sword and your Shield
[1:09:14] of faith
[1:09:16] but is it you're not worshiping from a
[1:09:18] closed mentality
[1:09:23] there are certain people here
[1:09:25] that have an understanding
[1:09:28] you could put a Luther in this building
[1:09:30] you could put on Wesleyan in this
[1:09:31] building and they wouldn't understand
[1:09:33] what we're talking about but because
[1:09:34] there has been a barrier that has been
[1:09:37] broken all of the things have been
[1:09:39] ripped off of your mentality you can no
[1:09:42] longer think from the mentality of a
[1:09:44] closed book let me tell you once you see
[1:09:46] it you can never unsee it
[1:09:49] because God when he gives a revelation
[1:09:51] there might be intellectualism that will
[1:09:54] come and it might raise up to a certain
[1:09:56] standard but it'll only take you forward
[1:09:58] so far but Revelation never ends
[1:10:01] and what God has given you is not just
[1:10:04] some mental theology or an
[1:10:06] intellectualism he has given you a faith
[1:10:08] of Revelation to accept that the whole
[1:10:10] word is given unto you and every devil
[1:10:13] is trying to keep you from this
[1:10:15] you see there's a lot of people that can
[1:10:17] worship and say that they're worshiping
[1:10:19] but only you can worship like the father
[1:10:22] wants you to worship because you are the
[1:10:25] Queen of Heaven and there's nobody that
[1:10:27] can praise
[1:10:28] like you can preach there's nobody that
[1:10:31] can worship like you can worship job
[1:10:34] when he was in his worst of Trials he
[1:10:37] got up in Job chapter one then job arose
[1:10:41] he tore his robe and he shaved his head
[1:10:43] and he fell on the ground and he
[1:10:45] worshiped there's going to have to come
[1:10:47] a time in your life when you don't feel
[1:10:49] like worshiping that you have to worship
[1:10:52] so David said in Psalms 95 oh come let
[1:10:55] us sing unto the Lord and let us Make a
[1:10:58] Joyful Noise to the rock of our
[1:11:00] salvation
[1:11:01] let us come before his presence with
[1:11:03] Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise
[1:11:05] unto him with Psalms Psalms 100
[1:11:08] and Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord
[1:11:11] all you lands serve the Lord with
[1:11:13] gladness
[1:11:15] come before his presence with singing
[1:11:23] Exodus 15.
[1:11:27] then saying Moses and the children of
[1:11:29] Israel this song unto the Lord and spake
[1:11:32] saying I will sing to the Lord for he
[1:11:34] have triumphed gloriously the horse and
[1:11:37] the rider hath he thrown into the sea
[1:11:39] judges five and three hear o you Kings
[1:11:43] give ear o you princess ah even I will
[1:11:45] sing it to the Lord I will sing praise
[1:11:47] to the Lord God of Israel first
[1:11:49] chronicles 16 and 23 singing to the Lord
[1:11:52] all the Earth so forth from day to day
[1:11:55] his salvation
[1:11:57] not just week into weekend and night
[1:12:00] just came to Camp day to day his
[1:12:02] salvation Psalms 13 and 6 I will sing
[1:12:05] unto the Lord because he has dealt
[1:12:07] bountifully with me Psalms 30 and 4 sing
[1:12:10] unto the Lord oh you Saints of his and
[1:12:12] give thanks at the remembrance of his
[1:12:14] Holiness Psalm 66 and 1 Make a Joyful
[1:12:17] Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands Psalms
[1:12:20] 81 and 1 sing aloud unto God our
[1:12:23] strength Make a Joyful Noise unto the
[1:12:26] god of Jacob Psalms 95 Oh Come and Let
[1:12:29] us sing it to the Lord let us Make a
[1:12:31] Joyful Noise
[1:12:33] not a mournful noise but a Joyful Noise
[1:12:37] to the rock of our Salvation Psalms 96
[1:12:39] of singing to the Lord a new song
[1:12:46] let me go ahead and get one
[1:12:47] ecclesiastical devil right here while
[1:12:49] I'm here
[1:12:50] they say we shouldn't be singing these
[1:12:52] new style of worship songs
[1:12:55] but the Bible says Sing a new song
[1:13:00] everywhere I go I hear devils in my ear
[1:13:03] telling us that we should not be singing
[1:13:05] that song he is here and he is our
[1:13:08] Waymaker that song way maker has had
[1:13:11] more trouble than any other song that
[1:13:13] we're singing right now
[1:13:15] because people say that we're not
[1:13:17] singing that we're just singing that to
[1:13:19] anybody but we're not just singing that
[1:13:21] to anybody
[1:13:23] we're singing that to Jesus people say
[1:13:26] well you could be singing that to the
[1:13:27] cardboard you could be singing that too
[1:13:29] you could see singing that to anybody
[1:13:31] but we're not singing that song just
[1:13:33] anybody
[1:13:36] he's here
[1:13:37] even when you don't see him he's working
[1:13:39] even when you don't feel him he's
[1:13:41] working
[1:13:44] I'm not singing my song through a dead
[1:13:46] God I'm singing my song to a god that's
[1:13:49] a Waymaker that's a promise keeper
[1:13:51] that's a devil Destroyer that raises up
[1:13:54] early on Sunday morning
[1:13:56] and if he said sing I'm gonna sing
[1:14:01] [Applause]
[1:14:02] Psalms 98 I'll sing it to the Lord a new
[1:14:05] song for he hath done marvelous things
[1:14:08] can you say he's done marvelous things
[1:14:10] his right hand and His holy arm hath
[1:14:14] gotten him
[1:14:15] the victory
[1:14:17] Psalms 98 and 4 Make a Joyful Noise unto
[1:14:20] the Lord all the Earth make a loud noise
[1:14:22] and rejoice and sing and praise sing it
[1:14:25] to the Lord with a harp with the harp
[1:14:27] and the voice of Psalm where the
[1:14:28] trumpets and of a sound of a comment
[1:14:31] Make a Joyful Noise before the Lord
[1:14:34] Psalms 147 and 7 sing unto the Lord with
[1:14:37] Thanksgiving sing praise unto the harp
[1:14:39] unto our God Psalms 149 Praise You the
[1:14:42] Lord sing it to the Lord a new song and
[1:14:44] his praise in the congregation of saints
[1:14:46] Isaiah 12 and 5 sing to the Lord for he
[1:14:50] have done excellent things this is known
[1:14:52] in all the Earth
[1:14:54] Isaiah 42 and 10 sing unto the Lord a
[1:14:58] new song
[1:15:00] and it's praise from the end of the
[1:15:01] Earth ye that go down to the Sea and all
[1:15:04] that therein the aisles and the
[1:15:06] inhabitants thereof Jeremiah 20 and 13
[1:15:09] sing unto the Lord
[1:15:12] so God
[1:15:14] must like to hear your voice
[1:15:20] he must like to hear your voice he
[1:15:22] doesn't like to hear you in sorrow he
[1:15:24] doesn't like to hear you in pain
[1:15:28] how many here this morning I just want
[1:15:30] to do something real quick how many here
[1:15:31] this morning is in pain in their body
[1:15:38] take a look around
[1:15:39] how many is hearing pain in their body
[1:15:41] this morning
[1:15:42] I got my hand on
[1:15:46] my body's still shaking from last night
[1:15:50] but we can't see your pain
[1:15:55] I can look all over you but I can't see
[1:15:57] your pain
[1:15:58] it's something internal
[1:16:02] that only the people that you tell
[1:16:05] how did I know you were in pain because
[1:16:07] you told me that you was in pain
[1:16:15] but how do I know you're in Victory
[1:16:27] you're not just telling me you're
[1:16:30] telling every devil in hell I'm a
[1:16:32] victory
[1:16:33] so God wants to hear where you are
[1:16:36] experiencing him from you are
[1:16:39] experiencing him from freedom
[1:16:42] why was Miriam over there in Exodus 15
[1:16:46] singing and playing or tambourine well
[1:16:49] that's because of the experience that
[1:16:51] she just had
[1:16:53] when I watched my little girls come
[1:16:55] through this line last night under the
[1:16:57] influence of the mighty angel
[1:17:02] you don't know what that does to a
[1:17:03] daddy's heart to watch the same God that
[1:17:07] gave you a birth gives them a birth and
[1:17:09] for them to Rejoice under the presence
[1:17:11] of the Lord
[1:17:13] but you can imagine my heart but imagine
[1:17:16] God's heart this morning he knows what
[1:17:19] you've been through he knows the pain
[1:17:21] that you're being in he knows the
[1:17:23] struggles that you went through
[1:17:25] that's why your soul
[1:17:27] can only be sunk from you
[1:17:31] you have got to sing you have got to
[1:17:34] praise when you don't feel like praising
[1:17:36] him you've got to praise him we don't
[1:17:39] feel like the strength is there to
[1:17:41] praise him praise Him anyhow
[1:17:44] when you are utterly drained praise him
[1:17:46] when the baby isn't showed up you still
[1:17:50] gotta praise him when the test is not
[1:17:52] positive you still gotta Praise Him
[1:17:55] when the Cancer's still there you still
[1:17:57] gotta praise him when the temperatures
[1:18:00] still whispering in your ear with
[1:18:02] bitterness
[1:18:06] you've got to praise Him anyhow when the
[1:18:08] people that you hate or the people that
[1:18:10] have utterly try to mock you and make
[1:18:12] fun of you are there you still got to
[1:18:14] praise him
[1:18:15] God wants somebody that'll praise him no
[1:18:19] matter what they're going through no
[1:18:21] matter what they're feeling
[1:18:24] God has appointed you to sing
[1:18:30] He Knows Your Song
[1:18:33] and only you can sing it
[1:18:37] there's power in your song
[1:18:39] there's power in your praise
[1:18:41] it's well I don't really have a very
[1:18:43] good voice let me tell you your voice is
[1:18:46] sweet to him
[1:18:49] he don't care how much talent you got he
[1:18:52] wants your heart
[1:18:53] come on some naughty he don't care if
[1:18:55] you can carry a tune in a bucket he
[1:18:57] wants your heart salt
[1:19:02] for too long too many times people had
[1:19:05] put their Harps upon the willow tree
[1:19:10] because the enemy had spread itself
[1:19:12] forth like a Green Bay Tree and it
[1:19:14] looked like they were prospering more
[1:19:15] than the righteous
[1:19:17] but you have got to get your heart down
[1:19:19] off the willow tree stop crying about it
[1:19:22] stop being in pity stop thinking every
[1:19:24] time everybody else's fault and start
[1:19:27] worshiping
[1:19:29] God wants worship and if it's going to
[1:19:32] be worshiped then we ought to do it
[1:19:34] according to the Bible we ought to
[1:19:36] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:19:38] you're not worshiping him from an
[1:19:41] experience of Moses you're not
[1:19:42] worshiping him from Paul's experience
[1:19:44] you're worshiping him from your
[1:19:46] experience
[1:19:48] you know that the Bible tells us that
[1:19:49] when Jehoshaphat had won a player that
[1:19:52] Jehoshaphat when the enemy the multitude
[1:19:54] that came in against him that the
[1:19:56] multitude went in there and they come
[1:19:58] all and they spread all around the
[1:20:00] children of Israel and Jehoshaphat he
[1:20:03] went up there where did he go
[1:20:05] do his self-pity
[1:20:08] to his problems
[1:20:10] to his struggles absolutely not he went
[1:20:12] to the house of the Lord and when he
[1:20:15] went to the house of the Lord he went up
[1:20:17] there and called a fast over all of
[1:20:18] Israel and he caught up there and notice
[1:20:22] what the Lord when the Lord will come a
[1:20:23] player and he met what Jehoshaphat he
[1:20:26] commanded a feast a fast me over top of
[1:20:28] all to the land of Israel and when they
[1:20:30] got up there God spoke to him and said
[1:20:33] this is my battle
[1:20:36] you see this is not just your battle
[1:20:38] this is God's battle and when it feels
[1:20:41] like you are all alone God has saved her
[1:20:43] and he says you're not even going to
[1:20:45] have to fight in this battle this is my
[1:20:47] battle and I'm going to fight for you
[1:20:49] but he gave Jehoshaphat instructions and
[1:20:53] he told him to go up there and appoint
[1:20:55] singers and praisers to praise him in
[1:20:58] the beauty of his holiness
[1:21:01] and when he brought them up there notice
[1:21:03] here's all of these multitudes in there
[1:21:06] all of them multitudes are in there all
[1:21:08] of them enemies are in there I want you
[1:21:10] to think about the enemy that you fought
[1:21:12] till you got here all of them enemies
[1:21:14] are lined up out there and here
[1:21:17] Jehoshaphat appointed singers and he
[1:21:20] appointed singers to go over there and
[1:21:22] they started singing and when they begin
[1:21:24] to sing aloud that the Bible tells us
[1:21:27] that they begin to shout and praise the
[1:21:29] Lord that the Bible said that the Lord
[1:21:31] said ambushments upon their adversaries
[1:21:35] the Bible if you go to studying that out
[1:21:37] it means to lie in wait so God was there
[1:21:41] before their praise ever got out
[1:21:45] before you ever broke out God was
[1:21:48] already there before you accepted your
[1:21:50] Liberty God was already Fair
[1:21:53] before you set yourself before God sets
[1:21:56] you free you God was already there
[1:21:59] and the Bible tells us if you really go
[1:22:01] to shutting out the Bible says if you go
[1:22:04] to studying out that ambushment it means
[1:22:06] to bring a confusion
[1:22:09] their praise was so loud that it
[1:22:12] confused those devils and them Devils
[1:22:15] turned on themselves and defeated
[1:22:17] themselves can you imagine the anxiety
[1:22:20] and the depression that you fought
[1:22:24] start taking their own swords
[1:22:27] and start slitting there on long necks
[1:22:30] that's exactly what's going to happen in
[1:22:32] the battle of Armageddon those demons
[1:22:34] are going to turn on one another
[1:22:36] what is it anxiety turned on depression
[1:22:39] fear turned on suicide and they
[1:22:42] destroyed themselves let your praise
[1:22:44] ring out of confusion
[1:22:46] you cannot separate War for worship
[1:22:49] because Judah means praise and every
[1:22:51] time you go into battle you've got to
[1:22:53] have some worship
[1:22:56] you have been elected overcome you've
[1:22:58] been elected to win the battle
[1:23:00] but you're not worshiping David you're
[1:23:04] not worshiping David from a body that's
[1:23:07] not been anointed you're anointed for
[1:23:09] this
[1:23:10] you're elected for this
[1:23:15] but you're going to go back to your home
[1:23:19] and the anointing is going to be on you
[1:23:22] things might look the same you might go
[1:23:25] back to the same seat fold you might go
[1:23:27] back to the same Mountain you might go
[1:23:29] back to the same church but the
[1:23:31] anointing is there
[1:23:34] when the prophet poured out the
[1:23:36] anointing he didn't come there and wipe
[1:23:38] it off of him he poured it over him and
[1:23:42] when he poured the anointing oil upon
[1:23:43] your life the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:46] he didn't come and take it away from you
[1:23:48] he sealed your faith
[1:23:54] let me know
[1:23:56] you know the Bible tells us
[1:23:59] the Bible tells us
[1:24:01] that there was no holy ghost at that
[1:24:03] time
[1:24:03] is that right there was no holy ghost at
[1:24:06] that time but when Saul was tormented by
[1:24:08] them Devils up there you remember that
[1:24:10] they called for a worshiper
[1:24:14] because worship drives away spirits
[1:24:19] it matters what you're listening to it
[1:24:21] matters what you're doing and they
[1:24:24] called little bitty old David up there
[1:24:26] because the prophet said in those days
[1:24:29] he said there was no divide there was no
[1:24:31] healing there so there was no Divine
[1:24:33] Healing he said but David was a Divine
[1:24:35] healer by music and David drove out
[1:24:39] Spirits by music
[1:24:42] so it matters what you're playing David
[1:24:44] wasn't up here playing some rock and
[1:24:46] roll and he wasn't playing some AC DC he
[1:24:49] was playing the Lord as my shipper and I
[1:24:51] shall not vote yay though I walked to
[1:24:53] the valley for the shadow of death I
[1:24:55] won't fear no evil the Lord is my light
[1:24:58] the Lord is my salvation the Lord is my
[1:25:01] rock he has enlarged my foots that I
[1:25:04] would not fall
[1:25:07] play his heart
[1:25:10] there's nobody that can play Your Heart
[1:25:12] Like You
[1:25:13] and David's playing his harp
[1:25:16] Saul begins to fill his Spirit renewed
[1:25:20] because of worship
[1:25:24] but Saul
[1:25:25] Saul had turned his face away from God
[1:25:29] but David was raised under the anointing
[1:25:32] for such an hour as this and David
[1:25:35] brought healing by music
[1:25:38] if there was healing by music thee and
[1:25:40] there's healing by music now there's too
[1:25:42] many people that's wanting to kick music
[1:25:44] out of the church but it was when music
[1:25:46] was played it went a lie to us a player
[1:25:48] and he was Miffy that there is when the
[1:25:51] spirit of the Lord Came Upon Elijah when
[1:25:53] he grabbed the menstrual and the
[1:25:55] menstrual was played so if God like
[1:25:57] music then God likes music now and
[1:26:00] there's nobody the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:26:03] has got the best worship she's got the
[1:26:05] best best best music players she's got
[1:26:08] the best dancers she's got the best
[1:26:10] worship person
[1:26:16] because you don't know like
[1:26:18] on what he's done for me
[1:26:21] [Applause]
[1:26:23] you're not worshiping from a spot of
[1:26:26] change let me deal with this just a
[1:26:28] little bit longer you're not worshiping
[1:26:29] from a spot of change you're worshiping
[1:26:32] from freedom
[1:26:33] is that right Lily you're worshiping
[1:26:35] from freedom and nobody can serve God
[1:26:37] like you can serve God
[1:26:40] all over this building I want you to
[1:26:41] look at your neighbor say nobody can
[1:26:43] serve God like I can serve God
[1:26:45] you know what it's like to be bound but
[1:26:47] you know what it's like to be free
[1:26:50] and when God put the message upon your
[1:26:52] heart for freedom to come by your way
[1:26:55] what no devil ever going to talk you
[1:26:57] back into going back after the unbounds
[1:27:00] I know what it's like to be set free I
[1:27:03] know what it's like to be in a prison's
[1:27:04] hell and you can't talk me back to going
[1:27:06] into it
[1:27:13] but the prophet said David was a little
[1:27:15] bitty old dancer said he was dancing all
[1:27:17] the time because David had the victory
[1:27:19] when he went up there before that great
[1:27:22] big Uncle alive that big old problem
[1:27:23] that he had
[1:27:25] big old giant looking thing
[1:27:28] big old head that you couldn't miss he
[1:27:30] said that David had so much victory in
[1:27:32] there before he saw the battle he was a
[1:27:35] dancing
[1:27:35] [Music]
[1:27:38] before he saw the last fall he was an
[1:27:40] action before he saw that Spirit leave
[1:27:43] him he was a dancer before he fell free
[1:27:46] he was a dancing the glass was still
[1:27:48] there but David wasn't answering the
[1:27:51] problem might be stacked up against you
[1:27:54] but the truth it says that Jesus
[1:27:57] it's a rock Jesus is your salvation
[1:28:01] Jesus is your freedom
[1:28:07] David was a little bitty old man the
[1:28:10] prophet said David went down there
[1:28:11] little dancing said he went down there
[1:28:13] dancing down into the valley
[1:28:15] there's Goliath still out there but
[1:28:17] David's a dancing
[1:28:25] suicide still sticking around but I'm
[1:28:28] still dancing problems are still there
[1:28:30] but I'm still dancing bitterness might
[1:28:33] still come and haunt you but I'm still
[1:28:35] dancing depressing my tongue but I'm
[1:28:38] still dancing problems might be stacked
[1:28:41] up against you but you gotta dance your
[1:28:43] way out of it
[1:28:51] come on David
[1:28:53] come on David
[1:28:55] David reached down there and he grabbed
[1:28:58] him five smooth Stones that's the best
[1:29:00] thing to do is when you go to a fight to
[1:29:02] pick up j-e-s-u-s and David walked down
[1:29:05] there he had so much stance on the
[1:29:07] inside of his heart that he went down
[1:29:09] there dancing
[1:29:11] he went down there dancing he said oh my
[1:29:14] that big old head of that Goliath how
[1:29:17] could I miss him it's a little bit of

[1:44:40] because you're worship
[1:44:42] brought him
[1:44:49] I don't know if you can see it
[1:44:51] there's a presence in this room
[1:44:54] [Music]
[1:45:05] I was in that camp just a few weeks ago
[1:45:07] I was multiple multiple multiple people
[1:45:09] that's followed the same presence
[1:45:12] but they're right why don't you raise
[1:45:13] your hand if you saw it right there
[1:45:15] look all over his building
[1:45:19] what was it it was a Milky presence of
[1:45:21] the Holy Spirit
[1:45:23] that came to our worship
[1:45:25] and he showed up again
[1:45:28] yeah
[1:45:31] he ain't gonna leave you after this camp
[1:45:34] its present is here to confirm that
[1:45:36] and he's challenging you to believe that
[1:45:39] the son of man is revealed in the
[1:45:41] bride's body
[1:45:47] is Easter
[1:45:51] reminds me
[1:45:54] it reminds me
[1:45:57] it reminds me about when the presence of
[1:45:58] the Lord came when Solomon was built in
[1:46:00] the temple and the congregation couldn't
[1:46:01] hit her because the presence of the Lord
[1:46:03] was so strong but it also reminds me
[1:46:06] when I Prophet was over there in Africa
[1:46:10] and he saw
[1:46:11] them heathens packing their idols
[1:46:16] and they were carrying that just in case
[1:46:18] that the god
[1:46:20] of the Bible couldn't keep them so they
[1:46:22] was packing this by packing his Idol
[1:46:24] around
[1:46:26] another Brandon watched them packing
[1:46:28] that Idol into that meeting and you
[1:46:30] remember how the prophet stood there
[1:46:32] was that blind man he was dealing with
[1:46:35] he'd been entertained by the religions
[1:46:38] of the world that day
[1:46:41] he said if any of your Gods can heal him
[1:46:43] come up here
[1:46:44] all right he said but if Jesus Is Our
[1:46:46] Lord why don't you throw down your idols
[1:46:51] and when that boy was healed brother
[1:46:53] random said there was such a dust storm
[1:46:56] because they had threw down their idols
[1:46:58] this presence reminds me there has been
[1:47:01] some Idols that threw down this weekend
[1:47:04] Idols that you picked up I don't say you
[1:47:06] created but your worship shows that the
[1:47:10] miners have no hold on you no more
[1:47:13] passion has no hole the person has no
[1:47:16] hope no oil has no holes fear has no
[1:47:19] holes
[1:47:22] you're right Ella
[1:47:25] okay you're right
[1:47:29] you found them to be true
[1:47:39] the guy
[1:47:40] here I am
[1:47:43] this can't change my life
[1:47:45] I could never be the same
[1:47:47] I could never go back into that
[1:47:49] the Lord in this presence
