elsewhere in your body and they're trying to find this source they'll be doing some extensive tests this coming up to find out the source we know the source she came from the devil amen but we also know the source of healing and that comes from Jesus for he was wounded for our transgressions we've had a lot of different prayer requests and we may not do this every time in every service but I just want you to know around the world there are people that their hearts are touched as they hear God moving in our lives in our hearts and people got grievious serious need this is the Bride of Christ they meant around the world that is just looking to God say I need your touch Lord and even among us we know there are those that are needs who with needs I've been hearing from God's faithful servant my brother brother Kenny Kemp quite regularly during this time and been such a blessing as we've just shared back and forth what the Lord is doing we're looking for a miracle in his life the healing touch he's been a faithful brother and deacon and loved and we love Him we appreciate him also heard from a brother Rick in California that asked us to pray for his need and this Grievous

to pull down the bride of Jesus Christ bogged down with sickness and illness all of these cancers that we read about Lord we know that you specifically told your prophet in this day you specifically address cancer then you said nothing will stand before your prayers if you can get the people to believe and we're believers today and we're asking in the name of Jesus that these cancers be rebuked

the name of Jesus as these frenzies prayers go out Lord may the Holy Spirit carry them on the wings of a dove and the message get through to every one of them that they're healed that they're healed that they're he made the seventh dub of the Holy Ghost just come down swoop right down where they are who they're hallelujah pull out your love secrets to out to them your healing powers your deliverance in your salvation I asked Lord your blessings and anointing upon this people today in the name of Jesus as we give you thanks Lord for what you're doing as Lord you bless us now as we go through in this service today in Jesus name amen amen praise the Lord man I'm gonna let you be seated just for a moment we're going to sing a song here that I want to teach you here in just a minute it's been one that I'm it's a it's an old hymn about a hundred years old really when the revelation of the truths of the Godhead began to hit it was not the full truth but it was truth as it was in its infancy and of course God gave us a greater expansion of revelation and understanding and so we you know we know that the greatest of all revelations is the supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ amen this microphone better quit saying hey man I I'd like to do my own amen and praise the Lord all right there there is no greater revelation in the revelation of Jesus Christ is us song the revelation of the Bride of Christ and any other unfolding revelation of the church ages of seals and so forth and it's all encapsulated in the person in Christ Jesus because it is a revelation of him and you can't get to first base unless you believe in the supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ and then y'all can give me just a little more sound up here - now we don't believe that Jesus was his own father but we but rather he was a body that God created to dwell in so the father could dwell in the son so he was only a son in that God was only a son in that he he made a body to come and dwell in and this condescending was for a further purpose so that in the Sun God could pay for our sins and dust redeem our flesh so he could further condescend and dwell in us bringing many sons to him selves you know the scripture begins Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God the Gospels of in the book of st. John it begins with in the beginning was the word and revelation 1:1 begins like this the revelation of Jesus Christ because Jesus is the revelation of God and brother Branham would tell us in the Patmos vision the first thing you got to know is that he is not a prophet he's not a junior God he's not a secondary God He is God little later in the same sermon he was sir he refers to John beingness in the spirit on the Lord's Day here's a trumpet and he turns to look and he says I'm Alpha know Megan he goes on to comment the greatest of all revelations is the deity the supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ you can't get the first base until you believe that that's what Peter said repent and then see the deity and so um be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of your sins and then you're ready to go in the spirit so the first thing you got to know is the deity of Christ I am Alpha and Omega yeah I'm Alpha and Omega and I there is no more but me I was at the beginning I'll be at the he that was which is and shall come the Almighty think of that that's what the trumpet said alright so the first of all revelations is the supreme deity of Jesus Christ you must know who he is when you hear the voice who is he I'm the first and the last time the supreme one I'm the Almighty how many believes that about our Lord Jesus Christ there's no salvation in any other name but in the name of Jesus Christ praise the Lord and then we're gonna be here for a while they done took my coat off praise God hey man hey man well hallelujah make yourself comfortable hey man we're just looking to the Lord today again and krita's see but brother branham explained the main revelation always is who Jesus Christ is the book of Revelation which is the revelation of Jesus Christ opens with the very thing show the supreme deity of Jesus Christ I'm he that was which is and shall come the Almighty the first of all revelations and then brother Branham and innocence arise on the son he takes a picture of the cloud and he turns it two to the right and he says um just turn the picture the way you're supposed to be he is supreme judge there is none other but him and that's the perfect identification again of this vindication that this message is truth this is the truth it is true making him not a third person but the only person amen amen god bless you and once you spend together with me as we sing this song the song is called it's all in him the mighty God it's Jesus and it's all in him you you know go ahead and those of you that are listening in you want to poke fun at me for singing this old song that's okay I believe every word of it amen the mighty God is Jesus the Prince of Peace is he they everlasting father the King eternally thou wonderful and wisdom by whom all things were made the fullness of the Godhead Jesus is displayed it's all it's all in so my god he refused ah it's called it's all in him now my god is Jesus and it's all Emmanuel

streams it's hallelujah amen praise the Lord sound like you've been singing that for a while hallelujah my goodness yes Amen when we have a baptismal service that's gonna be a good one to sing amen the fullness of the Godhead dwells in him Amen god bless you wherever you are from around the world and listening in here today we welcome you he helped us to make my heart just dance brother sister Hollis god bless you thank you for being here today and sister since the Rutherford back there sister Rhonda god bless you amen nice one that has come to be with a brother Chris or that our visitors here today you and your family god bless you each one amen god bless you Acts chapter 2 and verse 1 a man sister Sharon brought a guest so god bless you too sister Sharon and your guests Oh Acts chapter 2 and verse 1 we're going to read from today and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and then they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance and there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews devout devout men out of every nation under heaven and now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in the his own language and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another the whole are not all these which speak galilaeans now here we ever man in our own tongue wherein we were born parthians and medes and elamites and dwellers and Methos so potamia and in Judea and Cappadocia and Pontius an Asian and area and Pamphylia in Egypt and in the part some Libya about serene and strangers of Rome Jews and proselytes Crete's and Arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth s others said these men are full of new wine but Peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them you men are Gd and all ye that dwell in Jerusalem be thou known unto you and hearken to my words but these are not drunken as you suppose see and it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel and it should come to pass in the last days saith God I would pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my friend maidens I will pour out in those days of my spirits and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath and blood and fire and vapor of smoke and the Sun shall be turned to darkness the moon into blood before the great and terrible day and notable day of the Lord shall come and it should come to pass that whosoever should call on the name of the Lord shall be saved you men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as you know also yourself father bless the reading of your word now in Jesus name Amen god bless you can be seated the other morning about three o'clock I was woken suddenly and began to write some notes for this sermon de stood a and wrote down the title of what I'm speaking on this morning of the final outpouring now we are living in the fulfillment of scriptures and the final out porn upon the Gentiles before the rapture of course there will be a great move of God the Jews 144,000 with their two witnesses and Moses and Elijah those are not Gentile prophets those are Jewish prophets and I know there are those who believe that everything that can be poured out has already been poured out so they already put it all in the past and some would say brother Tim we already have the mysteries revealed and the last sign has been given so what more could be done sure I am but I want just to say to you though we agree that God has done some wonderful things in this generation don't put everything in the past amen because one may protest but Christ has already come and only in the sense he came in his word to a prophet and in that farm he has come with a shout but yet he is also here today present tense and he's here in bride farm we're gonna speak a little bit about that this morning and again he's coming again for us to meet him in the air don't forget that coming is still in the future it's what believers believe and the seventh seal of mysteries that it was not God closing of the book it was to open the book the book that had been closed the secrets that had been shut away that had been reserved for the end time God saw that it was opened to us in this day so it was not the closing of the book it was the opening of the book it was to show us our inheritance so that we could claim every redemptive right for ourselves and I want to say today is a day of the fullness where the bride will fulfill the New Testament um as brother Branham would tell us about the masterpiece and how that you know he described Michelangelo as he worked upon that masterpiece and then he struck it and said speak as he looked there at creation or are his his art work that he had done and he hit him upon the leg with his malady and it was so real to him that he said speech and and again a piece went off of him and to some that flawed the masterpiece but in brother branham's mind it made it the masterpiece because it was so real to the artist till till he could see he had seen it step out of the rock the many days that he had taken just a nondescript block of stone and worked and worked the hours and years that he had toiled and now his vision was materialized before him and God has also had a vision and he's also had a plan and God's also been working down to the ages and through the ages he brought it up where that he brought it to the masterpiece of the Old Testament where Jesus was the fullness of all the prophets he would start with the base and begin with working on the base and he would start with Abraham the faith of Abraham and the the grace that are they loved that was shown in Isaac and then the Grace and Jacob and perfection and Joseph so when it would go all the way from faith to perfection and then the building up through the prophets and all of that until it finally was God made manifest among us till we could say that it was all in him the wisdom of Solomon the Psalms of David the prophecies of Isaiah then the scriptures in Jeremiah they're all the different ones that had prophesied of him was now made manifest and out of the vision showed what God had in his mind to bring one in his own image but what made it a masterpiece was he struck at at Calvary and out of Calvary there was another piece come out of him the water the blood and the spirit that poured out from iam at Calvary and so it would be out of this that God would make him another masterpiece and this masterpiece would fulfill the New Testament and God has been working up on this masterpiece down to the ages somebody help me preach now a man and it looked like him many times that it would go down into failure and he would have to abandon the plan but he brought it out and brought it to justification with Luther and sanctification to Wesleyan and the ending of the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the gifts wind under Pentecost and finally he comes into perfection word that the bride becomes him bother me the embody me of all the the word that has been spoken she will be the justification that Luther preached in his perfection she will be the segregation that Wesley preached but in his perfection she will be exactly what this Zeus's three people preach but in his perfection and man we are here in the time of the perfection and now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament because there is another masterpiece in the making a man until finally he brings her forth and brings her also in speaking terms and a resurrection is called and our body changed and we moved from this mortal back in day immortality and that's the age that we're living in all the New Testament brother Branham would tell us in the message Shalom all the New Testament speaks of this our Jesus Christ speaks of this hour so then again you see it's not about denominations or how many members it's not the nicest buildings or the greatest places that we take God for what he's given us and it's neither is it about small cliques our little secret groups our big secret groups who who are exclusive and ma'am but it what it's about is God revealing himself in Christ bringing the fullness of all the word and encapsulating it in Christ and in Christ pouring out his spirit until it brings the fullness of God in his bride just as Jesus was the fullness of the Godhead so God is also bringing the fullness of the Godhead the word back into manifestation in Christ some mystery when brother Branham said when I think of this I just see denominations pass out the scene a man when I see God's great purpose revealing himself and having to first reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the Godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of the Godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminence the oversight the leading somebody with me now so you see the very same thing he brought it up to the fullness to the fullness of the Godhead was in a body and that body was Jesus but now he also brings it up from the ages until where he came comes again to cap out all the ages to finish all the ages with God manifests in in his fullness in a body but not one single person but in a multiply the multiple to body of Jesus Christ a man so he could have the preeminence the oversight the leading brother branham again in crisis of mystery I'm gonna read several of these from Christ some mystery God expressed in Jesus Christ who is both Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness of the Godhead bodily now how many's ready for the now we can all we all should be able to look back if you got a clear vision come on now if your if your camera's out of focus or your your your vision is out of focus you'll be seeing three persons out there or two persons or two lords remember if it ever comes in the real focus you're gonna see one one gone one Lord one faith one baptism that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself are you with me now so again let me go let me quote it again God expressed in Jesus Christ who is both Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness of the Godhead bodily now hey now hey my brother Johnny beat you to it see you needed to say now I want you to look over to your neighbor and just and just say it this is for now this is what to happen now that happened yesterday all the word was fulfilled in Jesus of the Old Testament right now we are coming out to another fulfillment now the complete fullness of the Godhead bodily 12 in his church the preeminence all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was has been poured in the church the believers hallelujah now now the complete fullness of the Godhead bodily all the word all of the word dwells in the body of his bride hallelujah amen again he would tell us he sanctified with his spirit in his blood of church that he might make every promise in this last day being revealed see he could go back and pick up what these other fellows has left off in the last days by His Holy Spirit and reveal all the mysteries of the seven seals see he's expressing his self that's his purpose that's why I that's the second fold of his threefold manifestation first to express himself in Christ then express himself through the church and then the same thing Christ was a word and when the crowd and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them and man we become the word that speaks of healing when it goes through us and brings healing hey man we express the word of casting out Devils when we test our devils and it flows through us and man when we live a holy life amen it's a word flowing through us what God wants of the people in this last day are you with me now so the same thing as he says I'm he said and the church with the Christ was the word in the church becomes a word and when it lets the word go through them but when they accept a hybrid denomination how can the word go through it it's grounded because it calls us a shorten it blows of you fuse but when the current is flowing flowing freely the Word of God and expresses itself the works that I do so you do also and then the last days it shall come to pass behold I send you Elijah the prophet has not done that then what about the rest of it and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers if sure and brother Branham was Elijah a man as sure as he was Elijah even so just as sure your hearts come by a message been turned back to the faith of the fathers a mound and then there in that time of restoration there would come a time forth Oh hallelujah I believe we're in that terminal restoration there would come a time for us when he could express himself in the fullness of his Godhead deity through his church have preeminence in his church oh my what the anointed man that was Jesus 2,000 years ago now we come to this important word again now people want to know what's not doing today what's the promise for the day now can you say now now what's this now the anointed people it was the anointed man but now the anointed people a man to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom you see there's gotta be somebody you match him that he can say the bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh and life for my life and power my power she's him anointed by why accepting what he turned down that's the word and Adam by coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word his spirit she anointed with the word what he turned down he comes back and we accept do you realize where we're standing then we're standing on the edge of Eden I don't live here that's exactly right because we're right back to the point to accept what Eve turned down and we accept a man now the last sound the last time you said brother Tim we've received our last sign let's talk about the last sign for a moment the last sign was God in human flesh a man we often think of the discernment being the last sign it is not the bride of Jesus Christ years the last sigh now brother madam tells us in in crisis a mystery the church his church will be there without spot or wrinkle she gonna stand there in the splendor of him his word made manifest she'll be a token that's a sign to the world the bride is the last sign I want you to get this you are the last sign brother Branham listen here included brother Branham but you are the last sign in temporal Florida and the trial brother Branham said I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of the Son of Man in human flesh through the bride's body so this is where the son of man the word the complete Word of God is going to be revealed it's through the bride's body again in service we would seek Jesus he said it and and there was one to the called out elected church that was showing the sign that God was in flesh Jesus was God in question if Jesus is in you tonight it is still God manifests himself in the last days the Son of Man revealing himself in his church the human flesh making himself known you see you got you get it God down here in his church making himself a getting the word the son of man being revealed in the last days as it was in the days of Sodom amen now in again it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness this is a actually 61 sermon but I thought it was noteworthy because brother Branham was preaching on where we stand we got to fulfill all righteousness all the word all the word that spoke of a bride in this hour alright so he said the Holy Ghost here is proving that he's among us now let the power of God let the witness of the Holy Ghost move into the hearts of these people just now given the much assurance like Daniel had like Noah had like Enoch had like John had like Peter had like Paul had like Jesus had like Abraham had like all of them had Lord it's becoming to us in this day were divine healing this poured out signs and wonders are being done Great Awakening has become among the people the Holy Spirit is dropped down among the people they have sounded spoke in tongues prophesied great gifts and signs and wonders the angel of the message the angel of the age has appeared to us um in the form of the Holy Ghost and he's bringing us a message we see it being fulfilled we see him taking our bodies and transforming us from mortal human beings into agents of God to speak forth great mysterious signs and wonders when we see these things and is becoming to us that we fulfill all righteousness amen in the message investments the last thing the church is going to see how many's interested well I'll tell you next week there's be the last you'll see today how would you want to hear this hey man let's listen to it the last thing the church is going to see is Christ manifested in his power in fullness in his church just before the fire falls Robert the last thing the church is going to see is Christ manifested in his power in fullness in his church just before the fire falls well we see Sodom and Gomorrah out in the streets come on man we see these things that are happening in our world our nation come on a man but the last thing that the church is going to see its Christ manifested in his power in fullness in his church just before the fire folks pick up your pen and write he tells us a bride will do on in his will no one can make them do otherwise they helped us save the Lord and they keep still hey man III say this respectfully we got to keep steel down by now but it's sometimes somewhere some people's got to realize they got thus saith the Lord you've got a message in this day hey man hey man we we we've kept still do you know what I mean prophecy Jesus sees tongues of cease you know interpretations of cease you know healings deceased miracles has ceased and we kept still people got it down where they keep still that's not what brother Branham was talking about hey man he was talking about that we have just sayeth the Lord or we keep still in other words we'll only say what the word said they know it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word you can't do this on yourself he did not complete his all his work while he was in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through his bride ha Jesus didn't complete it off so he left the part of his work to do and he's gonna work it through his right body hallelujah amen he knows that she knows that Christ will fulfill well now here's that word again well now fulfill through his bride that work which he left for this specific time all right so God's pouring out his self this is the last outpouring in perfect faith brother Branham said we become anointed with that same spirit a non of messiahs messiahs of this last day to sign forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ to show that he's not dead but he's in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in his people moving among his bride with a love affair to her porn out into her himself they are becoming one for the wedding supper the same signs promised by the same God in the same word is making his same manifestation there is nothing left for us to do but believe it how many ready to believe it a man and believe it is the substance and that creates a perfect faith that's all that's left to do is for us to believe it the super sign he says Oh God if the world could only see that that God and man are one the super sign was that first man that God could come into and all that God was he poured into Christ and all the Christ was important to the church super signed God and man together that to be the super sign of the last date so you're not only the last sign you're the super sign amen when the empower Bible was to be fulfilled in the last day of super sign the virgin shall conceive and this conception when it brought forth will be God manifest in the flesh the super sign and they still don't believe it but it was anyhow and it's still a super sign notice super sign they got Superman today they got fictions of Superman they got all these other kind of super things but the church has got a silver sign God back in the Turks manifests in human flesh God United with man he's sure super sang hallelujah amen the word and man become one thanks be to God oh if that was a super sign of that day when that same spirit that his own Jesus Christ comes in his church that manifests a written word today that is filled a super sign the church can have the sign of the council all I'm getting together for a fake world peace all they want to be the Baptist can say we've got a million more in 44 the Methodist can make any kind of brag they won't to oneness or Trinities or whatever they may be but the super sign is still God forever remains true to that super sign it's called a man manifesting his written word his word when he the Holy Ghost is come upon you he'll reveal these things and shown to you and will show you things to come Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you're the super sign what is that super sign God manifesting his people God dwelling in the church God embody and taken on your flesh the last sign in Abraham's day was God taking on 16 elements of flesh the last sign a man - to the Jewish world was caught taking on human flesh and when the last sign to the Gentiles will be God taking on human flesh and it's a greater is He that is in you mmm humming believes he's taking on flesh heavens receive the Holy Ghost then he took on flesh and now he says greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world I'm a greater is He that is in you than that lame condition we prayed about today other than the cancer that one summer you are dealing with my greater is he that anything that the devil could put on you hallelujah greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world you have proven people in this church have proven greater is He that is in you that drugs then alcohol then tobacco then six cents hallelujah you have proved to the world you are a super side that God is living in human flesh hallelujah are you with me now man I'll tell you when I walk into a rehab and I sit there with my wife and doctors and admah and physical therapist and occupational therapist and speech therapist walk into the room one by one in their term and they and they say they stopped at the door and turn around and look to see that the door the name is right on the door and they send it back to me and to us oh we were expecting something different after we read your chart you're amazing you're a miracle hallelujah amen what is it because greater is he that is in us then a brain bleed greater is he that is in us then a pronouncement of death greater is he that is in us that the doctors who said you only be a vegetable this is what they thought a man that called me on the phone because she's unresponsive and said you think your wife would like this I know what they're talking about because he could be left to vegetables they didn't expect her to ever walk talk know anything but I did hey man because I had no a greater physician hey man I know a greater physician hallelujah hey man oh my hey man well we were seeing he you see this God he is the God who controls nature he speaks to your storm you makes your body obey his word do you

brother Brennan said me we wasn't meant to be dr. Don anyway that's exactly right and it's believers we really wasn't meant to be dr. Don we have nothing against doctors God uses him in hospitals God uses him thank God for them and man they did their part they evacuated the blood out of her brain knee you know all all the things but God had to do the healing he's on who moved that brain right back in the place again that was pushed out of position hey man I'll tell you he's the creator he stayed up on the winds and the waves are the waves there as he approached the boat and then he healed the sick he destroyed sin he changed it all for you he comes to dwell in you he conquered he stays to come and live in us now we're not preaching about it Jesus 2,000 years ago we preached in Jesus Christ the same today but where is he in his church how in the form of his own holy spirit the Spirit of Jesus dwells in you he is that Concord that's already conquered these things so he conquered them all a man he proved in his Scripture and come back and proved to you he's still the same God by His resurrection power a man he's greater than all the world because he conquered all the world and man he's greater than all these things because he Krunk 'red conquered him for us and were more than conquerors a man he is a mighty Conqueror but you are more than a conqueror and man through him that loved us and gave himself for us that he might come back and do the works through us to prove today that he's the same yesterday today and forever world falling apart brother madam says the hour that we're living in Oh God the world is falling apart nur hangs in the hangers bombs there hangs the things to do just exactly and the fire is about to fall the Turks is ready she sealed in ready to come there will be a big outpouring on the spirit yes sir to grab that church and take her into the skies exactly because we see the church the word the bride in Christ his ministry is in the bride which his body the supernatural spiritual body of his on the earth his spirit is in there living his life right out until him and the church becomes one in the wedding supper and in the wedding and they become one a big outpouring well I'll tell you what if you're hearing there's a big out porn I'd get a big bucket for it I wouldn't say Lord just feel my cup I just say Lord fill me and thrill me inside outside all through me Lord feel every fiber of my being with your Holy Spirit let me tell you this bride is more than their mechanics I'm out this little this little flock that believes a word its mechanics is ready and God made sure he sent us a prophet set everything in place a man we know what the thunders are we know what the seals are we know what the mysteries are that pertains you the bride somebody helped me preach now a man is always ready been open to his predestination serpent seed marriage and divorce all of the different things has been revealed to finally reveal what God said in his word that the original apostles preached without the contamination of denomination the Lucien's have been tied together we have the answer to the devil's questions we're preaching the gospel that Paul preached a man we we have the gospel of Jesus Christ that he said he would not come back until this gospel was preached and all the world and then shall be income and the gospel is now being preached around the world and God has sped it up if you don't believe that right now there's listening across the world all over the place right now where this sermon is going out around the world and it's healing people it's delivered people hey man it's saving people I got emails right now people that have been saved listening in healed listening in delivered listening in hey man hey man I don't even have to I don't even have to leave this place in this pulpit to preach around the world you know why God spit it up hey man God has put it in high gear man they're not only just watching that they're watching that the picture itself then and seeing it in real time they're part of this service this morning an unseen host but and group but they're there somebody with me and let me tell you not only are they there but Jesus is there too because Jesus isn't real there is he is here and his healing power just had real tear as he is here and is delivered since a real tear as he is here God's little flock that believes this word its mechanics is ready - it's ready for the dynamics to set it afire with the Holy Ghost fear not little flock it's your father's good wheel to give you the kingdom the Holy Ghost will strike a little church I don't want to finish this for another night the Holy Ghost will strike who will strike a little church that's come out of the world let me describe her by the Prophet women that wear long hair Nazarite to prove their separated themselves from the world a man for the word of God not a short wearing painted face Jezebel calling themselves Christian no sir man no so we see Washington to stand for a denomination and hold on their coattails ISM Caesar or Herod instead of spending for the Word of God but God's got loyal people genuine flock of God who don't care what the world says they believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever she's a super sign to the world you'd already been seen in the vision I saw in that vision those clean face godly dressed women from all over the world from every nation Martin and tuned onward Christian soldier you notice it wasn't say in retreat they would say now [Applause] God's got a lawyer genuine people Alleluia i standing the other day in LSU hospital little girl from the physical therapy come in see one know about Karen's hair was it long because of because of something religious yeah cuz we believe the Bible that's right well our church used to believe that some of the older ones still do but you know she went on to explain to me she says you know I'm but now our church does not follow the Old Testament customs I said oh I said well it might interest you to know that hair is not an Old Testament custom it's something that was mandated by the Apostle Paul in 1st Corinthians 11 and he said we have no other custom than this and I said it's what the Church of Jesus Christ does if they follow the Bible oh she said I didn't know that she does now hallelujah hey man hey man you know again you know brother brother branham talks about the the blood of Jesus how he must be so careful about the blood I want to just deal with this for a second cuz it has to do with my subject and he talked about how a man like when Dillinger was killed in Chicago or one of the villains your outfit was killed and he's shot in the street you know dunkers by the hundreds lined up to see this notorious criminal they used to do that those of you know about Bonnie and Clyde they paraded their bodies all through the you know this area you know showing their trophies of Bonnie and Clyde and they're riddled car and all of that tracks hundreds gawkers but he said the blood spread up the street and and people were suspicious of that they would they wouldn't step on their fellow man's blood but then he says they'll walk right through the blood of Jesus Christ this whole saying is through fools well what would hotmail shoes where angels fear to try that's right they'll walk right over it and say the days of miracles are past hmm that was all right for the apostles but not for us oh my how can you say you're tramping under the foot the blood of Jesus Christ wherewith you are sanctified with oh my think of it the blood on your hands now we wouldn't today daresay the days of miracles are past although that's what many actually believe we know the word would condemn us for that so Satan uses another tactic we would just say its first and second pull preaching now some of you that's not acquainted with the message you're wondering you got a big question mark you'll catch on or they would say well we just don't made your own a miner yet it's only a minor when is compared to the healing of the soul a mass it's minor in compared to salvation but 80% of Jesus ministry was healing the sick that's pretty major hey man the principle work of the church should be casting out Devils a man and and now you see but he says you're trampling on the blood when you deny that he's the same yesterday today and forever when the emphasis is no longer there in the church I'm gonna find this little quote 8 oh yeah right here perfect faith this is you know it kills me today if you preach something you can read something before the seals well that was before the seals so we don't you know out that goes that that minimizes that so you preach it after the seals well then what was sad in jeffersonville or was dad evangelistic sermon out there like brother Brandon would preach something different you know my poor old mother she was a sweetheart but I'll tell you what you know if she there was something she didn't want to accept her of what brother branham said she just said well he just said that to throw people off to deceive him so they wouldn't believe and just throw him off she said that to me one time it was the wrong person to say that I said well then I quit following them every day that today I I won't nothing do with that man who would deliberately lie to me to throw me off and leave my soul to hell that's nonsense man but let me just say this in you know again in perfect faith it makes all the qualification is 63 August 25 and it's in Jeffersonville meet all the qualifications and I thought being here twice today it should be then we should dedicate one service for a prayer for the sick I believe in healing the sick I believe it's a Bible command we cannot preach that without the Full Gospel without including that so you cannot preach the full gospel without including divine healing it's not very minor after all a man perfect faith brother Branham says now that dental Gatien of a scripture Christian these words said Jesus these signs shall follow them that believe now how can you call yourself a believer of people and deny those words how can you call yourself a believer in deny any of this word you can't do it you're not a believer therefore signs can't follow because you just can't see it can't you just accept what you want to believe and let the rest of you just don't believe it but you've got to take the whole thing and believe it and when you truly believe not make believe but really believe then these signs follow them that believe that gives a pretty good qualification amen brother Branham said again that's how to identify you if you say you're Christian the identification or a Christian the Bible Christian is not worked in you then there's something wrong these signs shall follow them that believe yes or not maybe they're weird they will they will if we can only realize he's here with us the same yesterday today and forever law I am with you always I'll never leave you not forsake you I'm here I'm with you to the end of the world 24th chapter I'll never leave you here again he said I'll never leave you or forsake you I'm just looking at scriptures I wrote down concerning how can we be sure by his proven word he's not waiting for you to call him seems to be proved so let us go and awake Christ in our lives how do you awake Christ by believing his work faith brings him on the scene that's what brings him on the scene faith then call him to confirm by his word and don't doubt and fear don't do that um just believe him as it's written and let it let it be done and God will prove to you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we worship an invisible God hallelujah now let's just let's just go beyond this others will say well we're not second Paul or first Paul we're third pull well if you're in the third pull why aren't you speaking the word why aren't you moving mountains in the third Pulis creation in the third pull is resurrection power in the rail and the third pole is healing in the third pull is control of situations around you in the third polar salvation for children by man the word this word is to take the immaturity out of us and give us a holy boldness I've got some things to say about that this morning in the adoption message brother Menendez may choke you to death you know that men that are sons of God are a mature God's how many knew that how many know season said so did not the law say you know except your gods if you call them gods your God said in Genesis 2 there were gods because they had full domain over the Dominion of the world he gave him dominion over all things and he lost his conscience he lost his sonship he lost his domain a man but then Satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for the there's a time when the pyramid gets under the top anybody understand that where are we we're not at the bottom and network club's been building it come on we're at the top you know ain't built a pyramid that right you know the enix Pyramid was not a tomb men copied it made tombs out of it that's exactly what has happened you know the original the original Church was not a tomb its copies of the original Church that become tombs hey man the original meaning of pyramid was a place of Ascension come on where are we in the pyramid we have come to the top to the place of Ascension director time are you with me waiting for the bowl is a time when the pyramid gets into the top when the full sons of God will be manifested when the power God will walk out hallelujah and will take every Power that Satan's got away from him why we ought to be holding ourselves steady and letting God feel every fiber of our being because he said that's what the dynamics is is a refilling of the Holy Ghost hey ma'am this is where we're at he said it's a refilling of the Holy Ghost and we'd say he is a dynamics and we just become members of the Machine of his body forming ourselves in His image uniting himself with us or his work and his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper and we're waiting watching for that the big churches to be united that dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a small measure while they had stoned that Jesus Christ is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body heights together the full power the Holy Ghost a razor up just exactly like that even the dead that's in Christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his holiness and take a flight to the skies so notice he's pouring out his are uniting with us when his works with his love gifts as he hands him to us let's stop here just a minute love gifts the message oneness he tells about a church engaged to Christ for a wedding and the wedding in this type he said has not been performed yet it'll be at the wedding supper of the Lamb so we he said the church is now engaged like a man is engaged to see now Oh engaged his wife and what does he do when they're engaged now remember he slipped the wedding band to beat predestinated unmerited grace on you before the foundation of the world but you just now found out about it God chose you he's just bestowing all kinds of things sending her presents making her feel good a man and that's what Christ is doing to his church he's sending us gifts of the Spirit now how can you be engaged in when you are denying gifts exist it's the very love tokens it's God's token to the church Jesus sent so these signs have followed them that believe now keep those things in mind the church must believe every word every promise every out and claim it for themselves and exercise themselves in it if I was engaged to a girl and I was a single man and I would Cindy be send her something engagement ring she wouldn't worry it show she doesn't believe me she doesn't want to be my bride and if Christ sends his church the gifts that he's promised and they refuse them and say they're not so they don't want to be the Bride of Christ they're its thousands some other lover not to Christ the bridegroom so the real church keeps the promise and keeps all and accepts the gifts that God sends them can you say man all right again we're here at another shaking again this is a 1963 after the seals quote God is going to send another shaking across the country for there is somebody out there still out there somewhere that a predestinated seed that the light has to follow somewhere into the world so he said God is going to send another shaking before the fire falls amen what did he promise every filling of the Holy Ghost and man he said why this church ought to be a million miles up the road to where it is now Jesus wait on his church to get ready the bride has made herself ready we got the potentials the Holy Spirit is here God is here the power to heal the sick the power to do all the things that Christ did I've seen it demonstrated myself by the Holy Spirit so the potentials are here what God is waiting for us to get away from his art tradition and come back under the blood of Jesus Christ hey man that's exactly right now I'm gonna take just a few minutes because I brought you here to this point of what we're to be and I'm just going to stop here just a moment and digress just a little bit and the reason I'm doing this when you go to preaching these kinds of things it attracts every kind of bug to the light bulb ever wannabe prophet ever wanna be the spiritual guy ever want to be healer whatever want to be every kind of thing all for the wrong motives and purposes next thing you know this then this bolsters up all of these and they begin to quack you know I'm the greatest preacher on the block I'm the Prophet now I'm the boys and this we've had them we have we've had we've had the the supreme teacher lee vale we've had the supreme apostle Joseph Coleman we've had oh my goodness you go to start naming some of these stuff today I mean it's way out there some of them calling ourselves Elohim the Holy Ghost all kinds of nonsense I don't usually talk about those things because it discourages people but I just say it you know again again that you preach these kind of thing in a truck it attracts every kind of bug insect beetle moths creatures of the night to the light and let me tell you right now I want to just make some statements here we are not returning to Azusa Street no more than we can go back to being Luther or Wesley that is not the light of the day Isuzu was by nature an impersonation because it was the shock hey math Azusa was not a book of Acts church it was at best a Corinthian church one had a prophecy one out of gift one out of town one out of this one out of that and everybody was trying to be something all the while there was sin in the church that they wouldn't deal with that's in azusa church we are not returning to Azusa a mouth nor will we be a Corinthian church hey man listen brother madam send us an adoption and that's why I preached adopts and he said I can't get the Turks to come to maturity he said why you know how it is the churches groaning you know under them under the persecution of the outside world believing on the Lord Jesus Christ that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost how they groan and cry under labor pains but when they're born they're persistently born in the kingdom of God it's not something you're a prophet because mama said you was since she was a little boy and they fed you that junk I've seen too many mama called preachers and they never accomplished anything hey man but when they're born and positionally sent the Holy Ghost sets in the church some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists and then and then he puts in there he gives in there's vegan in tongues interpretations and tongues and knowledge and wisdom and gifts of healing and all kinds of miracles all in the jerks a man but the church he says he's always tried to take somebody else's corner I mean said you can never you can never take somebody else's corner you can never raise corn in the evenings corner if you're Manasseh every one of the tribes at different places in position in the kingdom and the same way in the body there is different things that God does and how he works with different people and everybody doesn't do the same things he said now we've been taught many times we've all have to speak with tongues that's wrong we all got to do it no we don't they didn't all do one thing and then some of you have spoken times some of you haven't it's the same Holy Ghost what we're looking for is a change life not because you spoke in another language we've seen people speak in tongues and live like the devil ain't that right hey man so again it's not it's not his you see that that was that's babbling it's supporting the 14 of I'm a forged to worship Azusa Street forts gifts forts tongues and then when they couldn't get everybody speaking tongues had gotten down the hall turned taught him how jerked under chin until they did had them to repeat a word over and over again till they got a stammering lips till they set a confusion of language and there's very few real that is left but because it's their evidence of the Holy Ghost so Gavin do it or they're not saved so it causes impersonations we don't you to impersonate anything we are not to be an impersonation that's Azusa Street we want real genuine Holy Spirit moving but I tell you if you yield yourself to the Holy Ghost ain't no telling what gotta do for you hey ma'am you know we don't need another to rise up then try to take the 7th angels trace or to be the prophet in this age somebody help me preach now we've had enough of that we've had 15 years or more I can say almost 16 years to to to purge out of Zuza so that the real pen across could shine forth other Branham talks about this in the message identification and he says he said Nathan a smart leader down in Egypt rose up and said you try to make yourself the only one that's got anything like I said this kind of preaching will will attract bugs to the light we have seen men rise up in this message and become the next great prophet in their own thinking so they had followers across America and even overseas I've run into him in Africa run into him into Anna and Norway a guy who got a six-inch pick guitar pick that he was gonna give the bride rapture in faith by singing these songs and all it was was a middle guy I'm serious not throwing off on him he just had mental problems he had an evil spirit calls him mental trouble and he led people by the hundreds away and it went on down until a cricket spoke in tongues and he and interpreted and it calls fallen to way across the world just a bug at the light people with mental troubles and evil spirits try to get in their work the works of God didn't a woman fall appalled and say these men are the men of God and begin to prophesy over them and Paul wanted to mount a shut her mouth until and he couldn't do it until God gave him permission and he suffered with her for it so I don't remember how many days he suffered with her until he rebuked that spirit that spirit of divination that was attracted to the light a man so you so again you know brother madam would disarm people and call it spiritual problems you're hearing voices you're seeing things and this is spiritual problems and it takes them away from the word then bringing them into the Word of God and people follow it because they don't have any discernment now but brother man said everyone didn't have to create and do miracles and things that's the trouble with people today a lady asked me coming down the road the other day is Florence a gariand Dimas his sister sister Williams and them sat in the car she said brother Branham I passed and fasting and I still I can't cast out Devils what did brother Branham tell her you're not a believer coz the Bible said these signs have followed them that believed and you're not casting out Devils so you're not a believer that ain't what he said he said you wasn't born to do that your duty is so fast the Holy Spirit's working on somebody else out there for that you don't know your place all we said if we had time we'd teach those things and long meetings how that one person is burdened for this was something over there you don't know you don't know you don't know what a and it's him doing it you're just submissive to your call and always line it up with the scripture and see if it's not right or not but so he says you wasn't called to do that so now we see it's in the body some are you looking at me well I'm not a believer you know this morning you said that the identification of believers they'll casts out Devils well okay let's just stop right here and clear that for you every one of you saved cast out Devils out of your own life every evil thought that comes your way and you cast it down you are casting out a devil so don't let the devil come along and tell you you're some powerless Church powerless people and you don't have that identification remember cuz how else could you have overcome the habits of the world that you had come on unless the Holy Spirit in you rose up and cast him out I'm looking at a bunch of devil to Peters this morning a bunch of serpent bruisers hey man oh you said brother Tim huh I've never done what you did then the other brothers did he use Kemp maybe you're not calling to do that but you can fast and pray while somebody else is doing it you got a job to do your part of the body everybody can't be the tongue everybody can be the iPhone everybody kept me there everybody can't be there hand everybody can't be the foot it's somebody question answers they they ask brother Brandon whatever true believer this 19c serve or do the works of Jesus dead in John 14:12 he said not exactly no heal the sick cast out Devils razor then I don't I don't think that's John 14 he said mark 16 it's okay he says this only to be Elijah must all the believers do this that really believe if he's really a Berea believer will he raise the dead and do great miracles and brother Brennan said now that's among believers hello you know when you when brother Brandon went up to the mountain and got a sword you know you got a sword do you know when the seals was open to him that seals were open to you come on a man when Moses went up there and got the Ten Commandments not just Moses got it that was easier getting the Ten Commandments oh man when I preach the gospel anywhere around the world it's you preaching the gospel around the world oh man well when I'm door when I pray for the sick and they recover or any other believer does it it's you doing it that is a mom believe us but see if Zeus the street you got an over one of them to be doing this and we got to have this and this is kind of spiritual dream and that one's got a vision and this one's got a voice and this has got this and and it becomes a bunch of confusion because they turn it to in a Corinthian church anyway he says now and then he says every man doesn't have those gifts don't mean just one person would do it it'll be groups of people like for instance we have a little girl here in the church the little boy is somebody that we love real well in life but go out of them the whole church would get together and go to fasting and praying lord have mercy on that child God can raise it up I mean read they're not seeing fathers in them you know that's the way they did it in the early church they'd all get together you know even raise up their pastor sometimes in different ones if God seemed fit to do it the church praying amen so now again what is promised in this outpour is another Pentecost and I want to say it's not coming that's here that's what a prophet restored us to was back to the faith of the fathers another Pentecost not another Azusa Street but another book of Acts not another book of Corinthians brother Branham cries out in 1963 bring us back to Pentecost not Hollywood's children ship but a whole hearted turn to God is what we need one more Oh Lord what's more a man uniting timeand sinuses What did he say in malachi for would restore restore back the original Pentecostal faith back to the people with the same Pentecostal message the same Pentecost assigned the same Pentecostal evidence the same God same power same treatment same exactly with the vindication of the same pillar of fire that struck Paul down on the road to Damascus amongst us today doing the same things he did in that day in birth pains he says die and he talks about the mission of the bride and he says what he said I saw that same group come back again she's half an Omega what is cease to be the same ride the same kind built on the same kind of material she was in the first place they'll read out Malachi 4 in silver not suppose have a message in the last day that will turn the hearts of the children back to the father's back to the original Pentecostal message word by word brothers we are here this message is the original Pentecostal messy it's not as easy street it's not John Wesley or Martin Luther it's the seventh angels message a man some people who gives throw him preeminence to the word in the revenue resume of the aegis notice somebody who had gives him preeminence people that are a prisoner to Christ resume of the ages he said God's gonna restore the Lutheran age did not restore the church it started or information the Western age didn't restored the Pentecost rage did not restore but God has to restore because he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the churches so restoration God will take the church right back to Pentecost out the beginning so this is different from Azusa Street the Sousa Street revival now has 500 million followers wrap your mind around that one that little movement back over a hundred and twenty something years ago now has a half a billion followers and let me just say now it's not going to be another Azusa Street that makes a bunch of denominations this will be different even from the divine healing revival this out porn will not be another divine healing revival understand what I'm saying it won't be divine healing movements all over and hearing people come and draw all over the world I am NOT saying people will come to church here and be prayed for that's not what I'm saying I'm just saying it won't be another divine healing move that's not what the last outpouring is it's not another divine healing move let me just tell you what brother Branham said about the divine healing move I guess he ought to know he was the one who's the catalyst of it all and he says he takes us to James 514 what you just put that up because this is the responsibility of every church every message Church should make this one this scripture it's principle Scripture is is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord next verse and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and he was committed sins he they shall be forgiven him Mar that that scripture right there in James 5:14 come on so while God was to get us away from laying on the hands well maybe he does but he puts this in the church hey man I believe it can be as Peter spoke these words and even knew you that are listening across the world today I can't go to you and lay hands on you but the word can go to you and you can believe and receive it just as well as anybody here in the building hey ma'am but anyway again I give that's the duty he says of every Christian minister ever minister the gospel is a right to pray for his congregation and they have a right to believe God and be healed divine healing doesn't belong to one man or one group it belongs all the people the gift the healing was not given to be given to be sent out to have different healing campaigns across the country it's alright for them to do for them to me but that wasn't that isn't the purpose there ought to be a healing campaign in every Church all the time going on everywhere and man we shouldn't have to wait for special ministry to come by I mean even you know shouldn't even have to I didn't even Sydney map to wait you know for me to lay hands on them you we've seen it demonstrate just lay hands on your baby and it's hearing come back sit it right in the meeting so I don't need these hearing aids anymore right there wherever you're at do you know your back healed your your your come on now church ever need supplied right is the world is going for appeal get the devil but through your every time I preach I'm rebuking Devils hallelujah I'm telling them you lead the church you leave this body you believe these believers greater witness brother Brennan said God never intended all these campaigns sweeping across the nation he expected that to be in every church every pastor so let me tell you it's not going to be another divine healing campaign God has let us have 50 plus years to pass to get Azusa Street out of us with all his carnal impersonations its wannabe prophets oh yeah they stand on the fringes of this message because they know it's got a supernatural element hoping to be one of the witnesses to the Jews and thinking they're gonna get the revelation of the seven thunders well you you know it is showed you're not a student of this message you ain't got into the word if you knew the word you know the thunders have already been revealed they just have been revealed to you so you're still standing around looking priests revelation well it come to a prophet is the seventh angels message if he didn't reveal the seven thunders he wasn't the seventh angel and if he is the seventh angel then he revealed the seven thunders and he didn't need he didn't mean some apostles helped to do it and he didn't need some teachers help to explain it and he don't even need my help it's right there in the message itself the seven thunders are though when the seven seals are the mysteries of the seven thunders they were revealed in the seals there were what symbols but now the voice of God has spoke out and now we know who the white horse are read the back impale the Tundra's have been revealed so if you don't know what they are you hadn't been in the message that's all there is to it or either that you've been looking at it with denominational veil on it the seals and the thunders are different brother Tim yeah they're different in that God's sealed a mystery and the others when God reveals a mystery God sealed it up not revealed it the thunders are the seals was the Salem the thunders was the revealing it is that simple you can make it hard and difficult if you want to and they're all open over a hundred times brother madam said all the seals are open well yeah there was times he said the Seventh Seal you know God wouldn't permit that because he wouldn't release it he'd said too much about the third Pole but now we got it God's sealed it up in seven seals and now the voice of God the thunders have uttered the voices and gave us interpretation of what was sealed up and I don't want to say we don't need another prophet we don't need another revelation and we don't need to go beyond the Prophet and his message hey ma'am but I would like to see somebody come up to it and really believe all of it this is the third pole and it will not be impersonated we're not too shocked we're not impersonators it will not be a puppet show it will not be another worldwide healing campaign or another worldwide revival the manifestation of the word of the third pole though will be miracles Amanda will be a bride standing on her feet as a mighty invincible army amen that's where we stand on this day a man we stand right here at the end time and we see where God is not fulfilling his word and bringing it to pass look what the third pole was it's created do you know every divine healing is a creation when God healed my wife the other day he had me he had to create new he had to create new brain cells when he took cancer out of sister Atlanta he had to create new cells she didn't have an empty place it was creation a man the third pole where'd is the creation it went for a thousand miles and healed me to Branham and it vanished the miracle the third pole you say I when we're preaching to their pool then there are to be miracles you can't preach the word and there not be miracles come on church amen my goodness that's what we ought to be looking for is a God of miracles God moving on the scene for his people yes sir saving the Lost what about those boys of hatty rights they fell on their knees weeping and crying he wasn't a dried confession it was the Word of God that went forth and saved the last it's the spoken word going out a man controlling nature one that he controlled is flowing let me tell you he'll control the storms in your life in your marriage in your home in your situation on your workplace somebody help me preach now and then because why it's the word and action creation resurrection life hallelujah and they're not going to just be in one place it's going to be around the world won't be just seasoning like Tabernacle it'll be a bride out of every nation hey man when is it gonna be brother Tim when people begin to start believing again a man if you've watched Azusa Street out then maybe you can have the pure words start working and the pure word will heal it'll deliver it'll save it is satisfied it'll do more than a Pentecostal Azusa revival will for a soul I'm Ballard my goodness I had a custom that said you know I went running up to him because I heard he prayed through and got the Holy Ghost I went SEMA with just a few days later on I caught him aside and I said hey I heard you got the Holy Ghost he's you but I'm all rings back slid and done lost it that's Azusa Street but this isn't a zoo the street it seals you to the day of redemption and it seals the devil out and sails our Holy Ghost yeah and it makes you a new creature in Christ and it gives you an overcoming so the Holy Ghost just a temporal gift yeah for something just comes and it goes it comes and it goes and it's like a dove sitting out then they grieve it away and they invited back in as a yo-yo back them forth and one day their Christian one day they're not but let me tell you if your seed if the real seed has been germinated he never leaves you again you're sealed to your destination hallelujah the rapture is yours the
