praying that God will speak to you in a tremendous way and amen we're thankful to to God for his goodness to us just love the the presence of the Lord this morning sweetness of the Holy Ghost you know sometimes it produces um you know great joy and exhilaration and other times it produces just peace and and just Qui contentment and amen but however it comes we love it don't we amen we just want Jesus in our lives amen pray that God's blessings will be upon each one of you today and that every need that he will supply for your life if you'll turn with me to Exodus 12 and verse 21 we're going to get right into the word this morning just let the Holy Spirit speak to you in a very special way way and you know um they didn't change the clock up there so I have an extra hour this morning and so that's wonderful that we can they they do this for me every year they forget that clock and and uh be it's a special time amen amen it's always good to be in the presence of God and be with his children be able to Feast on the good things of God and and to know he's he's God over every situation and able to do for you beyond what you can think or ask we ought to ask big things of God Amen because he's capable of doing great things amen we just look at our lives and see what we are because of him and real realize what we would be without Jesus and uh you know I said the other day about you know I I don't know what I would do if I wasn't a Christian my grandson Drew you know he's he's got a young mind he looks over his mom and dad said he'd probably be [Laughter] smoking well you know but what would we be without Jesus amen what would we be without him that's probably the worst thing he could think of but you know you can smoke in a lot of different ways you can have a temper that's so bad that is uncontrollable you know there's you can have a personalities that's lit on the fires of hell but oh I'm so thankful for Jesus when he comes down in our lives and changes us amen Exodus chap chapter 12: 211 then Moses called for all the Elders of Israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the Passover and you shall take a bunch of his and dip it in the blood that is in the Basin and strike the lentil and the two- side post with the blood that is in the Basin and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning for the Lord will pass through to Smite the Egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lentil and on the twoos side post the the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the Destroyer to come into your houses to Smite you amen God bless you can be seated I want to speak today on a lamb for your household as you you know I I recently come through the message of the token which brother brandham said was a high light of his entire Ministry outside of the Seven Seals and and that Commission of God that that all the other sermons had kind of pointed to that and I I think it's very very vital and important and today we want to speak about a lamb for your household and and um and you know to to keep the death angel from your home is very of vital importance and and of course that is by applying the Holy Ghost to your house and I I don't think who you no matter who you are this morning that you're exempt from the death angel come knocking on your door and the enemy come in to try to destroy and to to wreck and to ruin but um you know we we we want to have the blood applied no matter where we are what what our situation is and brother bradam told us in the message of the token he said believe what believe on the Lord Jesus Christ for your house and apply the token to your house now you know and of course this was easy to see in the Old Testament that the lamb would be killed and there was a physical house to which you applied physical or literal blood but here in in this uh instance we we see that the token is now the life of the blood which is the Holy Ghost and that life must be applied to every household it's very very important and brother brandom told us about applying the token well of ver first thing you know you've got to get rid of the Le in your home as they would in the Jewish Customs they when they would approach the Passover they would search the whole house for leevan anything leevan had to be thrown out and they would even go to the extreme of lighting a candle or or shining a light under under everything removing anything that would be of Leaven because it would be a representative of sin so brother Brandon said when you apply to your house what you do you move all the trash out out you get the short skirts and the shorts and the cards and the cigarettes and the televisions and what more and kick them out the door and when you go to apply the token he said you you won't stand still for it you take it all out the the dances the parties the rock and roll the old vulgar newspapers the stuff of the world you kick it out the door and say we're cleaning the place up so of course this is uh one of the very first steps of of getting ready for the lamb you know you you want you want your house to be a place where Angels come where the spirit of God gathers amen where it um where it comes with the Holy Angels there and and their presence and I present because as brother bandam said you make your house a place where that he's always welcome and of course when you look into your home and you see things that are out of order it's time to bring order to the disorder in your home saying we're cleaning this place up and of course we have to bring this thing to a modern day a modern time that we're living in it it's it's very important that we we also realize the the things of our modern times that we are caught up in that takes away our time from really spiritual things and not only that but from family time and family relationships you know where that we we get caught up in in um the things uh that could be useful tools but you can't let it control your life you know we hear of things I I'm not familiar with all of them but with Facebook and Tik Tok and Instagram and and and different things and many of this can be useful tools but it cannot and it should not control the life it should not control the conversation you know it's so many times even with family gatherings families can't be families anymore and and this was a complaint that brother brandham saw you know where there there is a breakdown of the family because Satan is after your family to destroy family life and it's hard to keep unity in this day and hour that we're living in and hard to keep a a Christ centered uh family and family life and family structure and and it's hard to do when everybody's on their cell phone and you can't have a conversation it's hard to do when when everybody's in their own little world out here in an imagination living in an imaginary world that don't really even exist you know it's hard to do when it's when uh when we have young men young women that are caught up in gaming and different things that that is taken up all their time and and and all their energies and that's what their mind and their focus is upon when in this hour our Focus ought to be on Christ now you know you know I'm I'm going to throw out a lot of things here today and and when you put medicine out you know just take what's on the shelf for you and and um you know leave the rest of it up there for somebody else but don't do no pitching amen just just take it if you can use it use it but you some of these things that we we go through today I mean you find it it stirs up Strife it stirs up jealousies it stirs up Envy it start starts up arguments and debat amen the things that that that burden your life down that keep you from having that family structure that is that is Christ centered and brother Brenham is talking about this he said kick those things out get get rid of the things or at least limit those things that that are becoming destructions in your life and getting you off of what's really important amen you know as I said you know I I I've dealt and I sometimes deal with people around the world and when you hear of people getting fantasy relationships even on the internet and you know back and forth and communicating back and forth for you got to be very careful and keep your guard up because Satan will get in there and and you'll have a romantic um relationship in your mind whether it ever turns physical and you you're married people you that's adultery you know that amen it's adultery and so you you got to realize these things can be the gateway to good information or to bad information or to good relationships start a bad relationship and you must apply the token the Holy Ghost even to practical manage now so it must be to your your your household and you must know the Death Angel is coming he's here in the land and don't let him steal your joy don't let him steal your peace you know don't don't let him allow you to get over by looking over into somebody else's um life and their business and what they're doing and and you know who they had for company and what they had for supper or what they have in their home or these kind of things to cause you unrest and and discontentment to spark jealousies because you wouldn't included when you could be the bigger person and include somebody else I'm going to talk about some of these things this morning because you want to apply it to your household you you see brother Brandon said get ready apply it believe it clean up let your children let your family let your loved ones see it in you that's right and it'll take effect so you want to see it in your you want everybody else to see it in you you are influence influencing someone else even if you're a young person a young boy you're influencing other boys use your influence right if you're a young lady you know use your influence in godliness if you're a young adult or you're a young married couple you know others are looking to see how you are living and what you are doing and they're going to emulate it and worse than that your kids are going to be watching what you do and your attitude toward Christ is going to have a real effect on their lives and that attitude is showing you know even in Church attendance or or your or how you relate to others and how you handle things in your home and that is going to have a great influence it'll have more influence than all the Sunday school and the twice a week times of coming to church your daily life has an influence upon your family and you want them under the token now these are some very very practical pastoral things but I I want to speak about it this morning because the atmosphere of your home is very important brother Aaron spoke and did masterful job on on atmospheres and so on like that and I happen to be studying at the same you know at the same time with with this so I'm some of this may be reiterating or reinforcing but you know I I want as if the Holy Spirit was dealing with me and dealing with him at the same time I think it's very important that we bring some of these things out but you know the thing about it in our lives you know we all have things that we look at Even in our own homes or maybe the way we was raised or brought up but it's time that you break the Cycles it's time that you realize hey there are things that I really need to quit blaming on how I was rais and how I was done and my my past let the past be the past and you know and and allow God to give you a real future a lot of you need to leave your past behind well this preacher done me this this wrong or that one did me this way or this person didn't act right or or my parents were this kind of people or what if it's wrong just break the cycle you know don't let it continue to govern and Rule your life amen realize these are these things stop here there's there were things even my life that I had good good parents and and I was raised by Christian people and yet there were still things that I had to break the cycle and I said that stops right here I'm not carrying this down another generation you know I I would hear always here because my my folks in the past were Pentecostal and Pentecost split into two and and you know the Trinity and the Oneness and and then the Holiness and the non Holiness and and some of the family went this way and that way and you know they they all claimed to have the same baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Pentecostal experience but they were all you know separated and they they allowed that to destroy relationships they allowed that to destroy love in the family and then I find that it moves right on into the message where you can't even have siblings that can worship together and you know one's is this way and one's that way and it and it follows right on down but with me I decided with my family we're breaking the cycle we're not taking this on another generation I don't have to see this repeat because I'm stopping that right here amen and and that's what you have to do you have to break the cycles of your complexes of your failures of the failures of the past you see them for what they are you call them what they are and then you apply the token amen it's very very important and and so brother brandham would would would be asked some very simple questions for example he said brother brandham what activities should our our children participate in and how should we go about selecting their assoc sh you know that's very important you say well I have no right oh God I I can't stand these modern parents well I have no right to their room no you that's your home and the tokens got to be applied amen it should not be that you walk in and the room's all black and all all all with hip hop and all the other nonsense whatever it is no that ought not this is God's house the token is applied here we want the Holy Spirit welcome we'll have the right kind of music we'll have the right kind of of attitudes we're not going to reflect things of the world we're not going to have Pinups and things you know that that represents Hollywood and all of that we're Christians here amen so you know that's part of it so brother bam said what was asked what kind of activities and how should we go about helping them select their Associates now you know I I hate to hate to say this and I hate to even go here but you know sometimes you even have to watch it even with church people you got to protect your family even even you you are young Christians the first thing you got to do is cut off the wrong relationship people that are going to pull you down amen because you are known by your friend friends you're known by your Associates and so you know when you come to Christ you're no longer associated with that kind of life let them know I'm a Christian I don't do those things I I don't want to be a part of that anymore I'm not going on your grounds amen now so you see and brother brandom answered you know what keep them in Christian company as long as you possibly can and if it's a girl keep her with Christian girls Christian boys vice versa if she's old enough to go with the boy see that she keeps with the right kind of boy discourage her to any boy otherwise or girl to boy boy to a girl if she's going with an unbeliever try to encourage her to go with a Believer and vice versa you know there's a lot of questions comes up about about mixed race and mixed marriages and all this let me tell you the worst mixed marriage that is sin and that is for a Believer to marry an unbeliever don't even go near them don't even date them don't have nothing to do with them so well I'm going to witness to them be very very careful there because he will change or she will change for you instead of a real reason amen and the real reason for coming to it should be to come to Christ to get in love with him not to do this to please a girl or a boy now so you see you you make your home nice this is what brother brandom tells us make your home nice make your your home a place where your daughter or son will not be ashamed to bring their company before their father and mother and into their home and make the home so happy that they will be pleased in their home to stay there Hallelujah you say that ain't possible brother damn not in my situation listen I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me we are not talking about you being able to do it we're talking about applying the holy ghost that you get so in love with Jesus that the atmosphere of your home becomes Jesus and his peace and his love are you with me and and so you make your home so happy that they'll be pleased in their home to stay there you you see your children are going to emulate and copy what you do the way that you handle things the way you know they're going to they're going to express their temper this same way they saw you express it amen they're going to hold grudges just like they saw you hold grudges they're going to on the other hand show love and forgiveness amen you see again if you learn to love and be kind to everybody and I'm quoting and to be gentle and have patience it'll even make your home life different it'll make your Association different God will honor you well I tell you what I'm a man I can't say I love you you're not a man that's right you hadn't learned to be a man let's let's come on let's change it to Jesus right now can he tell us he loves us can he express love to his children can he tell his sons I love you amen now if you get Jesus on the inside you'll be able to do it too that's right amen so you see you learn to love and be kind to everybody and to be gentle now you see you must be a Godly example Christianity must be lived at home it's not just for church it's not just to put on an air in front of your business associates and I'm a Christian praise God you know and you're saying Jesus Jesus all the time that's not it real Christianity is something lived it's must be lived at home if it doesn't live at home it doesn't work now you know every every home ought to start with devotion with praying together we you know don't don't drag out of the bed the last moment and leave without some special moments with your spouse and having prayer together ah you hung up on me you're dialing 911 said I thought I'd come to church brother Tim you're here I'm serious don't drag out of bed the last moment and leave without some special moments with your spouse and having prayer together you know girl don't let don't let that husband leave with you still feel in the bed hello you say Brother D you're oldfashioned yeah I am but that's exactly the way that I believe that family life ought to be is showing some love and care for one another it'll pay off it'll pay off so you see you know there there again there there are things you know in your life that you have to realize there there's a lamb for my household there's a there's a blood that's been shed there's a holy spirit that needs to be applied here and it's got to be applied there in family relations whether it's a husband wife whether it's with children whether it's with siblings with whatever else that you teach one another you know that you teach your children to love one another amen not the whole grudges and feelings and things of that nature to have peace in your home and brother Brandon said apply the token in prayer and with consideration and with believing and apply it with such love and so forth that you know it's going to take place and that's all you apply it with confidence believing it's going to help when you talk to that child when you talk to your husband when you talk to your wife you talk to this loved one believe believe it's going to help just stand there and say Lord I've claimed them they're mine I'm getting them for you Lord now this isn't something you say out loud this is something you're praying in your heart amen th this isn't this isn't something I'm praying for you now God's going to get you don't make don't make God the Boogerman amen amen no goodness and mercy is on your Trail his love is going to overtake you amen it's not it's not about nagging and threatening it's not about fussing and fighting you first thing you do is you get your faith right you begin to look at it my home is God's home this is where he is welcome this is where the holy spirit will live is in this home and he will abide here and his peace will abide here you you see you get your faith right and you start approaching it with a positive attitude and believing is going to help no matter what the obstacle is or how hard it is you believe it's going to help you know so you get your faith right and you you get the Holy Ghost in your life and you just let it live you let it create an atmosphere of Love around you not not stomping your foot in Anger not using ugly words but in love letting love be shown out now brother bandam said in the message of token apply it and create that atmosphere around you and they'll just drop right into it notice how he says it you just create that atmosphere one thing is an atmosphere of faith I believe God's going to do great things I'm I'm believing for my family my my children are blessed you know they they are they're going to be great in the land they are they're going to be there I'm going to be there with my with my Offspring you know I believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and me and my house shall be saved I'm going to have everything under the token under the Holy Spirit not not not in a thing where you where you're keeping them under the thumb of of rule and with angry demands and whatever and you're not doing this and we're not having that and whatever and we're kicking the tri out no you do it in a in a in a manner where that they can see Christ manifested in your life where God is moving and working and living in you the the Holy Ghost is more than the Holy Ghost is something more than just a feeling the Holy Ghost is an action in you now so you see so again you you you you apply it with confidence he said you create an atmosphere that'll just drop right in or you if you got the token you create a spirit around you a power that when you walk people know you're a Christian they love for you to say something to them they believe your word they hold on to it you see he taught us that we're miniature creators now buddy we all want to create squirrels I know better than that you get you Hunters here don't want a squirrel you want that trophy Buck I'll speak him right there I want that trophy fish I want to on my third try I'll get him third pull you know you want to be able to control the weather what I'm trying to tell you is about controlling the storms in your [Applause] life what good if there's Sunshine out there if there ain't a the sunlight so light in your home amen so now you see every man that's born again with the spirit of God in him is a miniature Creator now we are just not in the Millennium yet I don't know if you figured that out yet but we're not there so right now you know it's not the Millennium so we have all kinds of things that are happening in this world that we're living in and and and it's not a perfect world but you can control circumstances around you your faith can do it now he said we're in the image of God God is a Creator and that's the reason you can believe God could could heal a person because God is in you and God made the world and he just spoke it and his word become material the very ground that you're sitting on is the word of God made manifest if he didn't where did he did he get it he just spoke it and it turned in existence he believed his own word and if a man is born of the spirit of God he's an offspring of God and that part of God is in him and he believes every word that God says will materialize and so that makes him a part of God the holy spirit in the man makes him a part of God so you believe that every word of God will materialize so I'm going to have my family I'm going to have my children there's going to be his peace in my home there's going to be joy and comp contentment here why because if it's not there I can create it I'll believe the word and it'll materialize I'm going to confess his promise and it's going to happen so he said you you know you seen nice people but you just can't hardly stand to be around them well I I hope that isn't me seemingly nice but can't stand but uh you know I can take there's just some people you can take just about that much of you know you can tell there's something wrong in their Spirit you know I I I've met I've met people that I've and preachers even that I've had to keep at arms length you know I I you know there's just something there and you try you try to to break through it you try to you know go around it you try whatever but it's all always there you know there's something wrong in the spirit and and sooner or later it manifest but then but then you see and he said some people that maybe he a little scrawny f a little old woman bent over a washtub but you just love to be around them you know it it is there stature their looks or their physique you know it's it's the the atmosphere around them the way they live that create an atmosphere that you just like to be around that they're just lovely to people to be with isn't that what you'd want to be just somebody that everybody just they just love to get get with you because they know there there's something of godliness and Faith that's going to come out of your life you're you're emulating Christ now he said so he said you know you you can he said some you can see they're just they're nice or whatever but you don't like to be around them you know and and the reason is is because anybody can be nice on the surface but we're talking about depth we're not talking about something artificial either we're talking about being real and the way you become real is by a new birth you're birthed into this kind of life and you have the Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost In You allows the spirit of God arve to create an atmosphere about you he said you've seen people that you love to be around is that creative power that's upon the people they create an atmosphere around where they're at if they're full of love not make believe but real love you can feel it you know when you know they're Christians when you shake their hands say I'm I'm your friend John you can feel it you you might not agree with me but I I believe in heartfelt religion and I I think that's what we ought to have his heartfelt religion like the brother brandham quoted a a black brother saying you know that that the boss said to him said there's no such thing as heartfelt religion he said well one thing you like boss and saying there's no such thing is a heartfelt religion as far as you know amen as far as you know because he knew different you see and I believe in a heartfelt religion I believe you can feel it that God gives you something inside of you that changes you it makes the atmosphere around you different he said I've tried it I know it's the truth that man can create in himself the atmosphere that he lives in and around him he's anointed in the with the spirit and I've seen people you just can't couldn't get away from them you just love them that there's something drawn about them it's it's because they live in that atmosphere they live under the power of the Holy Spirit you see they they can change the situation by the power of creation because it can be done in a home it can be done in a church it can be done in a nation it can be done in the whole world is atmosphere that counts you see the atmosphere of the holy ghost moving through you it's a life it's a living Force it's not just a paint that's on your life that's external is it's a life that lives on the inside of you that flows automatically out of you amen this is what we're talking about token life it's a his life just living out freely through you not something you work up or pump up or have to get you know a a a another um another Revival to get it up it's something that lives out of you and flows out of you now you know just a very thing about atmosphere you can take an egg and of course it's the atmosphere of the ham with the moisture from her body the heat there that keeps it at a certain temperature produces an atmosphere where that there can be growth in that and that with a little chick in That egg you can do the same thing and artificially do it in an incubator but you see it's the atmosphere that counts and in a church in a home and even your life it's the atmosphere that counts you see you make up that atmosphere with what you are on the inside of you so you get the inside right first do you see there can be there can be an atmosphere for healing there can be an atmosphere for the Holy Ghost there can be an atmosphere for the love of God there can be atmosphere for peace and of joy and I want to say again it starts at home you know what a cancer is a cancer brother Brandon we talk about is it is a back sliden cell that's right gets in your body and it starts working erratically and it begins to grow and build another life that's on the inside when you got to realize that you this this church is made up with cells your family is made up with cells each one mom dad children all are cells of that family then those families are cells of a church one gets sick the whole body's sick that's why brother br will tell you that the misbehavior of one Christian can make the church bitterly fail amen now you know and and to make you understand that we're going to go on we're going to make it amen but you can cause others to bitterly fail or situations there where the atmosphere isn't right where there there's not healing where there there is not Deliverance where there's not uh Sal salvation because of atmosphere so it's very important that you when you come together create that right kind of atmosphere so the Holy Ghost can do its work amen but it starts at home it starts at home brother Bram said in the Seal of the Antichrist and this struck struck me sometime ago about our lives and he said you ought to go home everybody get down around the tonight or else bring mother and kitties and all them together around the bed and say mother let's pray right here till God makes things different around here well you said well they want to pray with me well start with yourself just get you whether you're husband or wife doesn't matter if you you're a child in the home hey I I'm telling you the truth amen I can point to a girl that was 10 years old and her mother and dad was not Christians and she got filled with the Holy Ghost and what did she you know with that with that within her life she began to pray for her parents and what happened they got saved you see that's what a 10-year-old can do with the Holy Ghost and you can do that too in your home for your family for your children but you have to believe you have to put your faith to work faith is not a plaque on your wall faith is something that must work be put to work faith without works is dead it's useless brother brandham said pastors you ought to call your congregations together on Sunday morning now and say let's start a new you will be kind to one another oh brother Tim that's uh that's ain't Seven Seals that ain't seven Thunders well Paul would write in the scripture and be ye kind one to another somebody needed that and that's in the words of the Apostle Paul I think it's applicable today be ye kind one to another Pentecostal preachers he said sometimes that men will go downtown you'll see them on the street sometimes we just jump into traffic and consider your friends I mean come on what what what are you doing what are you doing getting so Under Pressure that you're exhibiting road rage what are you doing I mean really is it that important let the other go first well you know you're you're hearing them today fighting and killing each other over over being cut off in traffic you have to be careful anymore you you're going to make somebody give you a cussing out because of just a wrong ter wrong thing or whatever but what about your attitude you see brother Brandon said if you see someone fixing to get a ticket I'm just showing you some principles I don't care who he is he said put a nickel in the meter now that nickel probably won't do much good anymore but anyway don't let him be fined he said even in everything it will grow on you you know you start making a practice of of of doing right you know and and and applying the Holy Ghost it'll grow on you try to be good to another try to shake hands and be friendly and nice you know I really don't have to say too much about that to you here in the South we're generally that way we wave as we pass people we speak you know but brother Brandon would talk about his own wife you know and and say to her said you know honey uh uh you didn't speak to that woman he he said I smiled he said a silly little grin he said that ain't the way to do it he said you take somebody by the hand give him a good shake and say how do you do God bless you you know again but I I don't really have to say that much about that here because you're that kind of people you're some of the warmest friendliest wonderful people on the Earth because God lives in you and I appreciate that for you I I love it that you don't let a stranger come here and feel like a stranger I love it that you're accepting and and that you're you're reaching out and that you're not judgmental of others but you try to be shake shake hands and be friendly and you you tear Down the Walls of petition of malice and difference and and ungodliness and you just keep doing good to one another and I I appreciate those virtues in your life you know that's the kind of people that are God's people every time you meet one another you brother Bram even said you make yourself be good sometime it just ain't natural so you have to have the Holy Spirit Well up with in you and make you do it come on Amen that old evil spirit made you drink and smoke and lie and cuss and hang with the wrong crowd it made you do it well why not the Holy Spirit In You amen flowing in your life making you Amen to the first thing you know that it'll just grows around you till a big bundle of love will just wrap you up and brother Brandon said said that's the marking of God now so you see it's a it's a sign of the Holy Spirit you know the sign isn't speaking in tongues or jumping or shouting or neither is it just say well I believe the message making confession of Faith but no it's a life that is lived out of here you know that's what you want to see is the life now in the Bible there are qualifications for pastors deacons and a lot of people think they got to be that way these are deacons must be pastors must be you know what you know what Paul was doing he says choose your leaders from these kind of people this is what a Christian should be amen yes lovers of their wives Christians true on the inside and out when they're in church and out where the community around gives a good report amen you you know again pastors and deacons you that's maybe their qualification but they're just chosen from those who are example Christians and one of one of the things that I want to speak about is lovers of hospitality the Bible said don't neglect to show hospitalities as strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares the example given is Abraham what if he' had left let those strangers pass his dwelling that day but he went and invited them in said Don't Pass Me By you you know the you see again this has given you the invitation to step outside of your comfort zone to offer provision or Comfort or safety and love to strangers and to those that are in need you said well you know I don't have the best house I I don't have the you know my house ain't ain't like everybody else's listen you know when I had a a little frame House of 24 by 32 and and this Center blocks to climb up on to get in it and I hung curtains for bedrooms I entertained Ministers of this message and gave them of what I had I had the liks of per Green in there trying to help help my wife sort you know through uh through the refrigerator and and stacking things in it to get get everything back in and he slept behind a curtain that was over the door cuz I didn't have it I didn't have the money to put doors up we had we we did with what we had come on you see you know often often you know we we got to step outside our our comfort zone and offer provision Comfort safety love you know inviting others into our home and and and giv a a place for them to feel the love of Jesus in our lives that's what it's all about Christian Life is living for others it's not about you it's about him it's about his people it's about making them feel welcome you offer the Bible said in First Peter 4 and a it said offer Hospitality to one another without grumbling oh God help us you know share again in Romans 12 he said share with the Lord's people who are in need and practice Hospitality well we don't have much it ain't what you have if you have some love that's what needs amen I I I've sat down I've sat down and just had Beans and Cornbread you know it isn't what was offered it was the love and it was a Hospitality you know but but I'm just not that way brother Tim it's just not my nature yeah I know it's out of your comfort zone but you got to break out of it even have friends it's easy enough to complain about not having friends well I don't have any friends and I tell you what everybody at that church is stuck up well you're lying right there cuz starting with me I'm not stuck up starting with from there to all the way to the back pew we're not a bunch of stuck up stuff up people you know but let me just say you know it's easy to complain about not having friends the Bible said in Proverbs a man that hath friends must show himself friendly that's so if you want friends you got to be friendly you got to make friends with others well no body ever invites me well start inviting others you you don't have to be the always the one entertained amen try entertaining others think about them their needs their situation you know it's like Martha she opened her home to to the Lord they they were called the friends of Jesus right she had a sister called Mary who she sat at the Lord's feet and she was listening to what he said but Martha was distracted about all the preparations she had to make you know this has got to be in order and this has got to be done and this has got to be done and and my and she comes in complaining Lord don't you care my sister has left me to do all this work by myself you know tell her to get up and help me and Jesus said Martha you're worried and upset about many things but few things are needed really only one and Mary has chosen what is better and it'll not be taken away from her you see Martha had opened her home to Jesus but her heart was distracted and worried about preparations of her home rather than focusing on the person in their home Mary Miss Mary understood that Jesus was the most important thing and of course we ought to be good stewards of our home but the most important thing in our home should be Jesus honoring him loving him serving him showing him to others loving those that he's brought into our lives and you know and if you just let go of them the the need of of for Perfection and approval you can you can be there to help with God's people that's right but you got to let go of that first it it isn't about impressing it's about serving it's about loving it's about giving it's about Entertaining Angels people that are going to be in eternity amen you see again again you know a lot of people don't find it's easy to open the door and to to be hospital but but there again you're going to have to let the Holy Spirit do a work in your own life and and become like the New Testament Church and the New Testament Church the Bible said after they were received the Holy Ghost they continued daily with one Accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house and ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart you see there was a camaraderie there was a Unity there was a fellowship now and of course a lot of us have complexes that won't allow us to do things and and you you say well what can I do about my complex well I'll tell you take the opposite amen if you're always wanted your own way you know you've been the little brat all your life that always always wanted everything your way way well turn right back and give away everything you got you know do the opposite of what you're doing you know if you want to hold on to everything Give It Away amen Jesus told the the Rich Young Ruler he said one thing you lack you you see he was willing though for that one thing to keep him from eternal life and he said just go Vice the versa so when you know know you got this family trait when you know things are this way you start doing things opposite amen that's the way to overcome is give it the antidote brother brandom said his old mother would say the hair from the dog is good for the bite well I don't know about that now I wouldn't go to that Kentucky way but I'll tell you this much you know the antidote is do opposite yes yeah if you know you're going One Direction just quit turn around do different you find it hard to to to to tell your spouse I love you then make your make yourself yeah make yourself I don't know how you got married honestly you had trouble saying I love you when you were courting and going together hey girl boy that's a wrong signal right there when you're when you're engaged or approaching engagement and somebody can't say express feelings and I'm not talking about manhandling Keep Your Hands to Yourself your lips too your hugs too be Christians so brother Bram talked about this we know there was one perfect man so all of us can use Improvement cuz there's only one perfect man and he made the example for us see Jesus never lived for himself he lived for others and brother BR talks about that he said that is perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when it come in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you re receive eternal life by receiving that day on Calvary and you don't live for yourself anymore so it isn't about you no more it's about Jesus it's about serving him that's why brother brandom would say that's why people can someone said how can you stand and let anybody call you bad names cuz you don't live for yourself that's you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgot they were Sons you sons and you're taking Christ's place you are Sons so you don't live for yourself you live for others so so some somebody called you a bad name so what do you do you exercise forgiveness I heard somebody say the other day a preacher said he preached a sermon and I I heard about this sermon that he preached he thought it was a great sermon and he and he says you know I if if you if you will not forgive a person then whatever you bind on Earth is bound on heaven so God won't forgive that person either till you forgive them I said that's baloney you got it wrong the truth of it is you can't be forgiven unless you let go of all your feelings of all your thoughts all everything just let it go amen and give it to God surrender to him that's what you got to do with it you can't continue living under that shadow it binds you it hinders you just let it go forgive it well they owe me an apology well forgive them their debt that's what Jesus said forgive my debts as I forgive others so you see I'm going to have trouble getting forgiveness if I don't forgive you want to be forgiven sure you do well forgive for whatever judgment you meet out that's with where you'll be judged you see Church isn't going brother Brandon said Church isn't going to church just to play music sing songs church is a place for correction judgment must begin at the house of God we must reckon ourselves dead and alive to Christ and then he made the way that we can sacrifice ourselves to his service to follow him if we follow him we lead the life that he led that's wonderful Jesus spoke of it and and and he and he goes on and tells he said but now it's not put on I just told you you know if you're if you're not that way naturally would do the opposite and I just told you you don't make yourself be good because I tell tell you you might not be that way naturally but with the Holy Spirit on in you you are that way supernaturally let the supernatural show amen we my goodness we've seen enough of Flesh let's see the Holy Spirit emulate itself from our lives so you know he would say there at the judine he would say to the Sheep stand on on my right side goats on my left side and he would say to them depart from me you workers of iniquity I was hungry you didn't feed me I was in prison you didn't visit me I was naked you clothed me not I was thirsty you gave me no drink I was sick and you didn't visit me so depart from me and he said now but notice this and don't fail to get this keep this in your heart forever that to the others it was unconsciously done they said Lord when when did we do this when did we feed you when did we when did we clothe you when when did we help you what and he said well what have you did to the least of my little ones you did it to me but he said notice it was unconsciously done it wasn't because it's my duty amen people don't do it for a line of duty a man that gives you something cuz he ought to man that feeds you CU he up to he's got a selfish idea it ain't about working your way to heaven it's about letting Christ live out of you so you know they were so surprised those sheep was and when they when they were said Lord when did we see you thirsty and we gave you drink when were you sick and we ministered to you he it was so automatically done it was just a life lived in them and that's what we want to see where where where Calvary really done something for us to place the Life of Christ in us and it's an unselfish life you don't even have the second thought no you don't have to think about it you're just dead the world so alive in Christ walking up the highway and these things are just an automatic thing they just automatically live out of you that's where you want to see it amen not a forc religion not trying to work your way to heaven but until the sweetness of the Holy Ghost comes down within your soul and it just flows out like Rivers of Life Giving refreshing Waters amen so you become a stream that everyone can come and drink from those that are weary and sick or needy that they can come to you and find virtue find strength you see it's not something you try to do or work yourself into it just something born in into you that's the token the token isn't a bunch of Works religious works and we're going to try to do better and try to do good no just get in love with Jesus and then let that love just flow out of you and it can come out unhindered until it just permeates the atmosphere around you and everybody just loves to be around you now you see um you see as as brother random said you know you know I believe in shouting but that's just emotions I believe in clapping our hands I believe in those things we ought have done that but you left off the great things undone it's that self-sacrifice life that God lives in you automatically doing that which is right because it's right and then going on don't even think nothing about it just living it and that's what I'm talking about just living it till Christ just lives out of your life life just flows out to others it's not artificial it's not put on it's it's not like a buzzard you know trying to put Dove feathers in him and say look I'm a dove you you know everybody can see your false I'm not talking about false humility and I'm not talking about false love I'm talking about genuine love of God emulating from your life in your home in your marriage to your husband to your wife to your children to your parents everybody in love with Jesus say it ain't possible yes it is we're in the day the token must be applied to the house a lamb for the household you know brother badam took a sermon he would often quote it it's not on tape when he called rever Mr Lily so the Lily is born you know down in the m in the mud and pushes it way up to the top and then puts out this beautiful Bloom that's that's who you are you were born in the muck and the mud of sin wickedness but you press your way to the top and here you are you know to to to glorify and beautify everything that's around you you know that that there's a Radiance a perfect fume you know you know that that even though you come up in the Quagmire even though you you came up in the world even though you came up in a bad home life but you pressed above that and here you are on the top and you're showing to everybody Christ lives and you're showing his Beauty and his Radiance and and there's there's a sweet smell about you and it it takes a an old dirty stinky Pond and makes a place of beauty Beauty there I see beauty in the midst of sbls and that's what God did for you he he took it took you out of the shambles took you out of the dirt and he made you a thing of beauty a thing that showed Christ that he lives that that even in this dark dismal dirty filthy World That Jesus Lives how do we know he's living he's I'm sh his resurrected life I pressed through the things that held me down the things people said about me the the things of my past what my husband did what my daddy my mother did all of these other hurts I I pressed through them all amen oh brother Tim but you know I tell you I I I I was rejected by my parents I was adopted let me tell you every one of us were adopted are you with me every one of us were adopted every one of us was born wrong everyone of us born in a wretched world that would have destroyed us but now we're not that anymore we're sons of God we're Daughters of God Sons of the king we don't have to look oh if I could have if I should have if this could to happen it happened forget it quit living in that yeah let the come the past be the past you got a new future every one of you is a Creator yes that's right did you know that every each person that's born again is a Creator we must create an atmosphere brother Brown talked about his own home and it was there was a an atmosphere there with his wife with his family it was due to people who were sick come to his home for prayer sick people laying on his porch wanting a vision or a word from God and you can imagine how it was if you were sick doctors had given you up or your child was sick or crippled or whatever else and you knew the prayer of this man of God would produce the miracle needed You' do whatever you could amen you'd lay on the porch you you you would you would Badger you would do anything you would try to get to that man of God because I want to be delivered right but you know what it made for brother brandham that normal family time wasn't possible it was hard to cook for his wife to cook and take care of little kids with a house full of people you know his wife would get nervous because of the atmosphere and this one you know this one upset about this and this and you know just thr about that and this and you know W in a word from the Lord here and even sometimes worse some people coming with a so-called word for the from the Lord for brother brandom to do their bidding but you know and a day after getting everyone ministered to and prayed for and sent away he would then have to get the atmosphere of his home changed due to his wife being frustrated because of so many people there there's children hungry and crying and fussing but I want you to notice he knew he could create an atmosphere and rather than scolding her for not being a willing part of his ministry and dech christianizing her because she wasn't grateful that there were healings and miracles he instead began to silently pray as he worked about changing the atmosphere now most of us I don't know of any of you that have that kind of situation in your home where you know hundreds of sick people are laying on your porch and wanting prayer and this and that and the other you maybe your cause isn't that Noble but let me tell you tensions come let me tell you problems rise and the atmosphere gets wrong and you can change it in fact it's your responsibility to change it by the holy ghost that is in you now you know we we got different ideas you know many times about how to do this and I I met a man One Time by the name of Ernie fander I met him up in Washington and he was a man brother bradam talked about on tape and uh he was he was a a man that was well he he didn't really believe in God or anything else and somebody went to the meeting he saw that they got healed he went there and had his own heart discerned and he got he got saved and and uh you know but his wife wasn't saved so when he would come home she would be standing at the door just as soon as he got to got home and it would start balling him out for being coming home late from the meeting I wonder if she did that when he was at the bar but nevertheless because he had turned religious because she had been going to this Holy Ghost meeting you know she she was all upset and of course Ernie he recognized it as the devil and of course it was the devil and he said you know brother bradam said I'm bigger than her she's just a little bitty woman and I can hold her and he said I'll get her by the hand and I won't let go of her and you know and and I just try to cast The Devil out of her as hard as I can and I I stand there and said devil now you come out of my wife devil come out of my wife honey you're POS possess to the devil that's what's the matter with you come out of her devil well I tell you what if you want to change the atmosphere don't call your wife a devil please if you ever listen to me don't call her a devil and he saidwell brother Pander saidou going Ernie you're going at this the wrong way and he says well how do I do it so when you go come home bring her a box of candy oh goodness if you get candy this week maybe you ought to wait a week but he said bring her a box of candy and give it to her when you come at the door and put your arm around her and and he said that's the way you cast out the devil love casts out fear doesn't it fear is of the devil fear have torment perfect love will cast it out well perfect love will cast out of any devil hey if it will make Hornets go back to their nest if it'll make a killer bull go and lay down surely it'll make your killer husband go lay down or your Hornet be sting and wife go back to her nest you see the world is dying for love your children are dying for love your spouses are dying for love what why do you think the Bible said husband love your wives well cuz he knew men have trouble loving so he says woman reverence your husband because women have trouble with headship mhm but you see it's love that's what brings it together the mor that makes the things of God operate per perfectly is love one for another we want great gifts and oh my goodness but love is what makes it all work perfectly you see a again brother Bram told about another situation of a young Pentecostal and his wife was a staunched Lutheran and she when he came home she said well I guess she went down there and shouted last night I guess she was all speaking in tongues and doing all this last night and so he got down on the floor and said God I cast this devil out of her it was almost a divorce case and he came to brother brandham and said I guess we're going to have a divorce I just can't get the devil to move out of her he said brother you're wrong you're going at it wrong and I said when she starts like that say all right dear bless your hearts honey be real kind to her and see my how much you can do for her well brother brandham how will I ever get the devil out of you do as I say and keep praying in your heart and God will take the care of the rest of it so what am I telling you love the devil out of your wife love the devil out of your husband love the devil out of your kids amen you know he said he called This Man Called brother brand him up a few weeks later and he said you know my home is revolutionized my wife's a different person now I wonder who was different it had to start with him his whole attitude his response that's right the way that he was handling the atmosphere that he created hello it was just as much a change in him as it was in her so he said what is the most powerful screaming kicking stomping or putting your arms around in love God is love God so loved the world now remember if it's about drawing virtue or people being able to draw virtue from you strength so if it worked for Jesus it'll work for you and we create an atmosphere each one of us you know like like I said would you love to to be in the atmosphere where Jesus created would you love just to be around him to to you know it's just one big bundle of love and and respects and and godly fear but you know what with Jesus on the inside of you you can produce the same atmosphere Jesus produced that's right you see our character molds the image that we are and and as you live so is your character mold you to be what you are that's why there are those that you love to be around that may not be in your bracket of society or whatever else but you just love to be around them well it that may may be of A different race the brown or the black or the yellow or the or or whatever but there's something about that character that you just love to be in their presence because every person is a little Dynamo of their own you're you're cranking out an atmosphere and and of course you know brother brandham had things to say about family relationships he he talked about this in a message after the Seven Seals so you know it's still pretty important and the title of it was is your wife worthy of the Gospel did I miss that one oh is your life worthy of the Gospel trying to get you not to freeze up on me so he said he talks about a life worthy living a life worthy we're talking about token life oh token life is glory to God I had a vision note the vision we want to see is the love of God moving in your life yeah creating an atmosphere that's the vision we want to see until your your patience he says get from about that long till it don't have any end that's right anybody just keeps saying things about you well I don't care what you say he said don't get stirred up if you get stirred up you better go pray first for you talk to them again don't get in fusses this after after the Seal's teaching that's right amen found in the tap is your life worthy of the Gospel you know don't get in fusses don't like to get in fuss if you like to see somebody rise in the church you know what I'll tell you so and so did so and so you say now brother shame on you oh but if you say oh is that so and listen to that Scandal he said the holy spirit is not a Cess poo that's right amen you know sometimes you you need to say is my ear a garbage can that's you know the heart occupied by this holy spirit is full of Holiness Purity it thinketh no evil doeth no evil believeth all things endureth it's longsuffering don't fuss so here's a rule in your home in your relationships whether it's on the job whether it's at school whether it's with siblings whether it's with parents whether it's with with with um husband and wife don't fuss rule number one don't fuss why the holy spirit is not a cesspool that's right and when the family gets in a fuss don't fuss with them you know it takes two to have an argument that's right your mother said I ain't going to have you going up there at that old church anymore well you all think about it now you're letting have your hair grow out look you look like some grandma don't fuss with her okay mother it's all right I love you just the same I'll be praying for you as long as I live don't fuss temper breeds temper so now we know something different something else your temper will only breed more Temple now so first thing you know you breathe the holy spirit away from you you'll be fastened back then the holy spirit will take its flight temper breathes temper but love breeds love be full of love this will all men know you are my disciples when you have love one for another that's the fruit of the spirit you know you're a little Creator yourself you've seen people you just love to be around you don't know why but just that loving type of person have you seen that just is kind you like to be around them they create that Atmosphere by the life they live the way they talk their conversation you see those that every time you you shun them all the all time they want to talk about something evil talk about somebody they're going to criticize somebody he's in here now he's going to talk about this man they're going to tell they're all they're going to do is tell dirty jokes or something about women or something like that you just hate to get around them they create seemingly pretty nice people but they create that atmosphere the things you think on the things you do the actions the things you talk about creates an atmosphere so now we learn what what helps create atmosphere things you're thinking on so first of all get your thoughts back on him amen I'm going to have a good marriage I'm going to have a good home my children will be in peace there's going to be love among us we will not tolerate nothing else we will not accept anything less we're going to have the peace of God that surpasses all understanding to be ours and we're going to show it but first we got to think on it we got to have the right kind of attitude toward it the actions then what your thoughts are then put it in actions amen I mean this is same thing is is you you get prayed for and then you go acting like you're healed confessing it amen the same thing you do for your family you begin to think on the right things and then you go to acting like it amen my family is healed my family is sealed my family is part of the Kingdom we are children of the most high God our character is like his and the things you think on the things you do the actions things you talk about create an atmosphere the crowd you associate with you see you can tell a person by his friends you can tell what a person is by what they read or what they look at or what you know things that that they're associating with you can know what kind of spirits in them amen so you see a Gody might claim to be one thing but his actions is speaking louder than his words but it all starts around begin to think on good things things that are good report things that are pure things that are holy come on Amen so you see again the the same thing you know it must be a a life that is worthy of the gospel and and you have to find things that are in common and there's one thing that binds us all together now some of you you like hunting the other might like fishing the other might like whatever else their their their their deal or whatever I I don't know people's got different interest some of you can tell me about cars and I ain't got a clue of what you're talking about but let me tell you there is one thing we got in common and that is Christ and that's where you build your relationship with each other on is on Christ and Christ should be the center of every family of every relationship boy and girl it should be first Christ centered on him you know the man and wife kept centered on Christ whether it's whether it's relationships with friend keep it centered on Christ everything on Jesus are you with me amen cuz that's the same thing that is in common like brother Brandon talked about a family that was splitting up and uh you know the attorney said listen you know when the when the lawyers get a hold of this they're going to take you for everything you better go down and divide the spoils yourself you know you shouldn't you shouldn't separate you shouldn't divorce but I tell you you're going to have to divide your the stuff that you have so they went into one room and and and they were fussing and steing and I bought this and I had that and my mother gave this and you know and and and they was fighting over everything you know quarreling back and forth they finally got up in the attic and and they found an old trunk and this was my mama's and this was this is mine and and they could they were D dividing up they couldn't agree and I you know I paid for that well I did the work uh I stayed home while you did it and just fussing back and forth and finally you know there was something they saw in there that they reached smok and grabbed it this same time it was a little pair of baby shoes of a of a baby that had come from their Union little shoes that you know that was of a little child and that had been taken from their home and and they dar is held it and they looked at each other one couldn't say it's mine and the other couldn't say no it's mine it was both of theirs they found something in common and she remembered who the father was and he remembered she was the mother and as they held those shoes in his hand they pulled one another to get each other and put their arms around each other and the divorce case was over because they found something in common if we will keep Christ in common if will keep him in common in this church the little things of mine and this and that and my way your way this that that and little arguments and F if you just get Christ in common and you'll realize that's what the thread that makes us all one is him and keep him centered and focused then all the other things of he didn't speak to me and she didn't do this and they ignored me and this and that and the other all the other stuff will just all go away because Christ is in common and if you get that in your marriage the same thing where Christ is walks in common and you realize we have all of this because of Jesus now you want to come down you want to come down to the end of your life with no regrets last conversation Karen and I had she would go in the hospital for her last time and I'd say Karen I I don't know what's going to happen the Lord's brought us through you went through brain bleeds and God healed you and gave you six more years and and you had another brain bleed and you came through the surgery they said you were going to die and that you'd never live God's given us another year together I said I sat there when you had that brain bleeding they did that surgery they they had they had come and told me look there's no way your wife can live this is a major brain bleed she will never live and you know you you should sign these papers and so on like this it was during covid I couldn't even go in the hospital to see her I was outside they bring me messages outside sitting in the car and I'd say I I said well you know give her her fun where she can talk to me said you don't understand sir she cannot talk we've intubated her now but she had already lost conscience and there's no hope her life is over and I sat with Timothy in the living room of my house he come he had left from where he was coming back from Arkansas he rented a hotel up there some hours away then he heard about his mom he just left it about 11:00 about 2: in the morning he sat with me she's in the in the LSU Hospital covid Zone I can't go there the doors are closed and I sitting there and he walks in and I said well son I said I don't know it could all be over this may be the end I don't know I said but I'll tell you this I said I have no regrets I said you know we've lived our life and if today is her last day I have no regrets and uh so a year would go and you know you gave her that welcome in home party and she danced out there on in front of the house and you got it all on video beautiful wonderful great memories thank you for loving us but I sat there in that that room with her that day in the emergency room and they had come and said you got another brain bleed and we're going to put you in ICU and she said Tim I don't want another brain surgery I said I don't think they're going to do that I think I don't think they can said I think they're just going to observe you and hopefully you know we can get past this you can get back home I said but we don't know the future I said Karen if God would call you if this would be the time that God would call you I said I sat a year ago and I said I have no regrets I said if this was the last day I said now we've been married 45 years and I can say still I have no regrets said how do you feel about it and of course the brain was being filled with blood she was getting darker by the minute and she looked over at me took me by the hand and said Tim I have no regrets I've had a good life when you come down to the end you don't want no regrets and you don't know when the end will come so you want to know you've did everything possible to do right that you let your life shine and that you had enough virtue that when other people needed something from you that you didn't you know the check didn't bounce and come back insufficient funds that you know somebody you know didn't look at you day today claiming to be a Christian and tomorrow seeing you acting like a sinner cuz there ain't much virtue can be dra from that virtue must be in us and God requires it when brother Brandon would look in these situations he said look you know I I I didn't fuss at my wife I just said that's right honey it's been bad today you know people have been in and out and they're all nervous and they're tore up and they're wanting healing and my family now is all tore up and and all the time he said in my heart I'm now trying to create this different atmosphere you know sometimes it ain't easy sometimes you come home sometimes you come home from work and the atmosphere isn't right and you're then you get angry it should be different around here I I should have some peace here I think things should you know stop a minute yeah the devil he works overtime he never sleeps so when you come home and you find it that way realize I'm a Creator and this is my opportunity to let my faith go to work so what am I going to do I'm going to change the atmosphere here not not with scolding ah if you were a real Christian you'd have seen these Miracles you see that girl with the braces and and she was healed and you're an ungrateful woman I'll tell you you know you just don't recognize who your husband is and no he didn't say none of that no scolding no fussing just begin to pray in this heart said Lord I got to create a different atmosphere so you know instead of instead of complaining and fussing he began to do what he could to bring disorder into order and he says I'll tell you what you you know I can I I can I'll do I I'll just help you wash dishes I'll help you clean up the place around here he gives some little toys to the kids that are fussing and gets them quien down and he says now you know I I'll tell you what I'll get in here and you know it wasn't wasn't easy to run to McDonald's it didn't have them it was all cooking meals at home and so you know he said I tell you what said nobody be around for the next couple hours maybe and we'll get something to eat and he pulls up his sleeves and goes to try to help her cook supper and she says now look young man you might be able to help me wash dishes but you can't cook and he says who can't cook I'll tell you what you ain't never seen me fried potatoes yet so I was raised on them and you know he gets in there and starts peeling potatoes and helping and you know and sees a little smile trickle on her face and and says and down in the heart you know every time he's coming by he'll let put his arm around her and as he does down his heart saying Lord send your peace the peace that's in me let it go into her now God quiten my family down I'm your servant Lord and you know he said it was to do as he talked about he said you know you saw to day he said wasn't it wonderful that little kid was here and the the braces was taken off and it walked and you know some things and just think together you know you're part of this and together we're going to walk down the streets of gold together and and and sing the Jubilee songs and and just watch me shine then honey we you're going to be right on my arm we're going to walk right down those streets of gold together and you know begin to try to change the atmosphere and change the focus and then a little smile come on her face and said Thank You Lord we get supper together now you're going to hate me for this you will you're going to men you're going to hate me for this but he says let me take you shopping there ain't nothing a man hates it more than to be drugged into a store to shop you think I look good in this don't you say nothing just nod your head yeah you look good in a to sack no don't say that you're beautiful in my eyes honey anything you wear be wonderful you think I'll look fat in this don't you answer that you can't win you'll create a bad atmosphere no honey you you're going to look beautiful cuz you're beautiful in my eyes I know whatever you whatever you pick out is going to be right and it'll be appealing you'll look great we we'll just you know there's a little dress shop well I you know you might be saying I hate shopping but find things that you can do put away what you like and self sacrifice for someone else it ain't all about you eternal life is living for others same way with a wife to a husband it it ain't all about you it's about keeping Jesus focused in your life and whatever you do don't help the accuser of the Brethren out that's right don't be an advocate for the devil and be Anointed with an evil spirit by letting him use your tongue your family your family members have enough trouble holding their head up because of the accuser don't be his backer don't be a tool that he can speak through but what he did he just tried to get her spirit quietened what was he doing what was he doing applying the token applying the token the same holy spirit that healed the crippled child where braces were removed as he prayed in the home was now being applied to bring healing to his family consider your wife consider your husband consider your family consider your parents self- sacrifice that's what that day on Calvary meant was he gave his life for you so you in turn be like Jesus and live your life for others the token isn't just running down the a it isn't just speaking in tongues or interpreting a message it isn't a holy and without attitude the token is the Life of Christ in every aspect of our life bringing healing to our home healing to our family there is a lamb for your house yes and that blood must be applied and he said brother Brandon said Lord I'm given the love of God into my wife Lord you help me now I want your spirit Satan would get us all confused and that's what he wants to do in your home always causing turmoil and confusion and fussing and hurting and and everything else you said wow I'll tell you what I hurt I hurt I know what it is is to hurt you know I know I know pain I've dealt with pain all my life you know I I've been with with my wife and and you know and be be out on my feet maybe walking to a mall or whatever else with her and all all of a sudden I I I feel my temper level you know getting higher and higher in my work words get sharper and sharper because of my pain and I have to stop and say stop h i I've got to go sit down for a little while and you know when I can get this pain leveled down because I don't take dope of any kind now if I can just sit down for a while just for a few minutes I'll be okay and we can go about about the day but I have to deal with this for a moment but sometimes people are sick and they want the world to know it and if you're a man quit being a baby deal with your issues instead of letting it control you you control it how can I do this with the Holy Ghost well I I got this PTSD stuff for brother Tim there's nothing to brag about get rid of it you don't have to live with it no more you're free children things don't have to control you you control it and your attitude toward Christ is going to have a tremendous impact on your family apply the blood to your home start it with your body with yourself with your attitude get rid of the eore self-pity everything goes wrong with me everything bad happens to me oh really you think you're the only person in the world something bad happened to I like going through this still with my wife I lost my wife I do not sit there in self-pity I refuse to do it I am not going to sit down and just be like a wited dog over here in a corner that's been whooped I'm not that I'm a son of the most high God he ordained and at this moment for me and I'm going to go through it like a Christian you know you want to talk about Japan look at Ron Spencer he's one that he emulates Christ every time he comes to the pull pit and there he is preaching when he don't feel good there he is still saying I love you God bless you whatever when when everything is going bad amen it can happen you can live for Christ and Christ can live in you amen that's the whole thing you know Lord send your spirit quen them I'm sending into your this home to my home in the name of your son Jesus and he said the first thing she'll want to talk about other things and atmosphere has changed now let me bring it down to this he said like when you're cooking here's how atmosphere can do he said you're cooking and you're frying your meat in the morning for breakfast and first thing you know you know you're filled with the spirit and he said I'm going to shock you a little bit by saying this he said the Meats frying and all at once grease pops out on your hand and if you'll just shake it off and go on frying meat it wouldn't bother you now I know you didn't get that just right but look the first thing oh where's the UN team something you grab your hand that scares you to death what is it it's fear Peter walking on the water he's walking all right till he seen the waves contrar and he got scared and Jesus said why did you fear and that's what's a matter matter with the Holy Ghost people today they got a lot afraid the devil's just trying to scare you out of something trying to put something off somewhere some of these days you'll be this you you are now we are now the sons of God we're seated together in Heavenly places so here here he said you know if you'll just shake it off things are going to happen in life Shake It Off trouble's going to come bad news is going to come hello this is not the Millennium shake it off amen rise above it say I am a Son of God and I was ordained to go through this trial and I know I'm going to go through it with Victory because greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world I can do all things through Christ that strengths me he empowers me let's bow our heads together let the musicians come at they will please you want to end your life with no regrets you want to come down to the end things have been made right and under the blood are you caring about an old pessimistic self-pity eore that every time you speak You're bring like a donkey because it's just coming out of poor me woe is me everything's wrong with me look at me everybody pity me nothing ever goes right for me it will never go right as long as you have that attitude you're going to have to create a different atmosphere get the token on the inside and let it change your life why don't you just ask God today so Lord I want to come down to the end of life with no regrets I want to come down to end knowing that I lived the Christian Life I didn't just talk to talk I walked the walk and I want you to ask you when I've had young people in this church
