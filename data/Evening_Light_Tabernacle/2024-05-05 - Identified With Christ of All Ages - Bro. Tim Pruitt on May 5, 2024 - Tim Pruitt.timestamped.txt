[53:23] there is therefore now no condemnation
[53:27] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[53:30] walk not after the flesh but after the
[53:33] spirit for the law of the spirit of life
[53:36] in Christ Jesus had made me free from
[53:40] the law of sin and death for what the
[53:43] law could not do in that it was weak
[53:45] through the flesh God sending his own
[53:47] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[53:50] for sin condemned sin in the flesh that
[53:55] the righteous
[53:57] of the law might be fulfilled in us who
[54:00] walk not after the flesh but after the
[54:02] spirit God bless you can be
[54:05] seated we're going to speak today on the
[54:08] identified being identified with Christ
[54:12] of all ages and here as we are looking
[54:16] at this um wonderful thought today and
[54:20] the scripture that we have read I think
[54:23] of the greatest truths of all times is
[54:27] that of
[54:28] redemption and certainly that was what
[54:30] we were singing about this morning when
[54:32] we were singing he's worthy of it all
[54:34] he's the worthy lamb he was slain in
[54:38] God's mind before the foundation of the
[54:39] world so he the Redeemer was long came
[54:43] here long before the cner for sin ever
[54:46] entered the picture amen so the greatest
[54:49] truth of all times is that of redemption
[54:52] and from the fall of Man onward God's
[54:55] Plan of Redemption
[54:56] has been
[54:57] revealed and when Jesus came he told us
[55:02] to search the scriptures for he said
[55:05] they testify of me of who I am and what
[55:09] my Plan of Redemption is and if we can
[55:13] see Christ in the characters of The
[55:15] Bible and realize that these are not
[55:17] just stories are not just myths as I was
[55:22] as I was reading this week uh about
[55:25] Moses and and uh someone said that you
[55:28] can be a Christian and just believe that
[55:30] Moses is fiction I I can't be a
[55:33] Christian and believe any of the Bible
[55:35] is fiction I believe a true Spirit of
[55:38] Christ is going to believe the word of
[55:40] God Amen so you know but we can see
[55:43] Christ in the the characters of The
[55:45] Bible and realize that they're not just
[55:48] stories but men and women expressing and
[55:53] prophesying uh in their day with their
[55:56] lives The Plan of Redemption and if we
[55:59] can see that then we can see Christ in
[56:01] all ages and we can see ourselves also
[56:06] because we can see ourselves identified
[56:08] in him amen now you know the as we
[56:13] already quoted the Jesus said search the
[56:16] scriptures they testify of me in them
[56:19] you think you have eternal life and of
[56:22] course that's true and and yet they are
[56:25] the on he said that is bearing record of
[56:29] me or I am bearing record of them so if
[56:32] we are identified with Christ we too are
[56:36] going to be bearing record of the
[56:39] scripture today amen and for he says if
[56:43] Jesus said if I do not the works that I
[56:46] promised that I would do then don't
[56:48] listen to me but if I do the works and
[56:51] you can't believe me well believe the
[56:53] works because they they testify
[56:56] that he is the word so you know again he
[57:00] he spoke of Moses the laws and the
[57:03] prophets the Psalms and they were all
[57:06] speaking of him um you know the
[57:09] scriptures testified of him he as we
[57:12] have been through it before he was the
[57:15] Psalms of David he was the law of Moses
[57:20] he was he was uh manifest himself in the
[57:25] prophets they were all speaking of him
[57:28] and he is the principal theme of the
[57:31] entire Bible so if you read the Bible
[57:34] and you don't see Christ in it you
[57:36] should go back and read it again because
[57:39] he's there in every verse um he he is
[57:43] there whether it's um from in the
[57:46] beginning God created the heavens and
[57:48] the Earth there's Christ we come down to
[57:50] the amen and Revelation every word is
[57:53] testifying of Jesus Christ so he said
[57:57] principal theme of The Bible he was in
[57:59] the prophets he was in the Psalms he was
[58:02] in the history you know it's more than
[58:04] history it's Christ in history brother
[58:08] Brandon would preach you know raising
[58:10] him up out of History where that you can
[58:12] see the god of history is the god that
[58:15] is here today and so he is in the Bible
[58:19] he is a thing that is to come he was
[58:21] before he is after and and that makes
[58:24] him then Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[58:28] today and forever he says I am Alpha
[58:32] that means the beginning I'm Omega that
[58:35] means the end I am the root and I Am The
[58:39] Offspring so you see in all of it he it
[58:42] is him from A to Z from alpha to Omega
[58:47] from the first chapter and the first
[58:50] verse in in the Book of Genesis and the
[58:52] last uh verse in the Book of Revelation
[58:55] it's all Christ and it's a revealing of
[58:59] him and and of course when you when you
[59:02] get the picture of him you're going to
[59:03] see he's the same in in every detail and
[59:09] he's the same yesterday today and
[59:11] forever what he was yesterday that is
[59:14] what he is today so that makes him then
[59:18] the principal theme of our talking of
[59:21] our our thinking of our singing of our
[59:24] walk of everything we do and say is
[59:28] because he he is the principal theme of
[59:31] Our Lives if we are Christians today and
[59:34] then if he's the principal theme of The
[59:37] Bible and and the Bible is in us then he
[59:40] should be the Principal theme of
[59:42] everything that we do say or think it
[59:45] all should be Christ so before the fall
[59:49] Adam was identified with Christ he
[59:52] walked with him in perfect Fellowship
[59:56] mankind lost that perfect identity and
[1:00:00] ever since then God has been at work um
[1:00:04] to since the fall to change man's
[1:00:08] identity from that of a fallen one to a
[1:00:12] restored fellowship and restored sunship
[1:00:17] you know God wants you to know you're
[1:00:19] his children he wants you to know you
[1:00:22] are the sons and the daughters of the
[1:00:24] most high God
[1:00:26] and and that he wants you to know that
[1:00:28] so that you can experience all the
[1:00:31] blessings and all the benefits that
[1:00:35] comes by knowing him now of course you
[1:00:38] know as I said man came into this fallen
[1:00:41] in um image and he lost his true
[1:00:45] identity and his fellowship with Christ
[1:00:48] and yet Christ became one of us and took
[1:00:52] on the likeness of Fallen man to Lift us
[1:00:56] up out of sin out of the muck the m and
[1:01:00] the corruption in order to bring us into
[1:01:04] his likeness and that was Christ that
[1:01:07] that that Moses for example chose to be
[1:01:12] identified with if you look in the Bible
[1:01:15] in Hebrews 11:26 I want to show you it
[1:01:18] was Christ in the Old Testament and for
[1:01:22] he says that Moses esteemed the reproach
[1:01:26] of Christ greater riches than the
[1:01:29] treasures in Egypt for he had respect
[1:01:32] unto the recompense of the reward notice
[1:01:36] who it was it was he it was the reproach
[1:01:40] of Christ that he esteemed if you look
[1:01:43] at in um 1 Corinthians 10 and 4 the
[1:01:46] Bible said that they all did drink of
[1:01:49] that spiritual drink for they drank of
[1:01:52] that spiritual rock that followed them
[1:01:55] and that Rock was Christ so you see it
[1:01:59] was Christ that was with them in the
[1:02:01] wilderness journey and then and of
[1:02:04] course it was they weren't just tempting
[1:02:07] Moses or chiding Moses or fussing
[1:02:10] against Moses and his leadership it was
[1:02:12] Christ because in verse n it said
[1:02:15] neither let us tempt Christ as also some
[1:02:18] of them tempted and were destroyed as
[1:02:20] serpents so again you see it was Christ
[1:02:24] now you know today we as as we have said
[1:02:28] many are in an identity crisis they
[1:02:31] don't know who they are even as a
[1:02:34] Americans many Americans have forgot
[1:02:37] their identity the college kids at our
[1:02:40] schools are the highest learning don't
[1:02:42] know a America of Revelation 13 as the
[1:02:46] lamb rising up with freedom of
[1:02:50] religion and that men fought and died
[1:02:53] for this Freedom that has been so
[1:02:56] precious but in the last day you you see
[1:02:59] it loses his identity from a lamb and
[1:03:03] begins to speak as the dragon so you
[1:03:06] know its identity becomes it shifts it
[1:03:09] changes from lamb and freedom of
[1:03:12] religion and and and um the extoling of
[1:03:16] Bible principles you know I I just just
[1:03:19] reading word that in the jail CES that
[1:03:21] they and I think it was in Minnesota
[1:03:24] where they painted all over over you
[1:03:26] know the law you know Thou shalt not
[1:03:28] steal Thou shalt not bear false witness
[1:03:31] and and and atheist came and toured the
[1:03:36] new facility with all of these things
[1:03:38] and sayings of of of of Great Men and
[1:03:41] great Americans that spoke highly of the
[1:03:43] Bible and Bible principle and Bible
[1:03:46] truths and and and all this was painted
[1:03:49] is on the wall and they're demanding it
[1:03:51] all to be repainted an apology put over
[1:03:53] said because you know atheist will not
[1:03:56] feel comfortable here in these jails
[1:03:59] well I don't think jails are made for
[1:04:01] Comfort I think they should be made for
[1:04:04] correction amen and they should
[1:04:06] certainly learn some principles of the
[1:04:09] word of God that says Thou shalt not
[1:04:11] steal Thou shalt not bear false witness
[1:04:13] Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou
[1:04:15] shalt not kill it is it's a
[1:04:18] transgression of the law that makes men
[1:04:20] Sinners but you know quickly people have
[1:04:24] forgot their identity and and they don't
[1:04:27] want to identify with the Bible with the
[1:04:31] word of God but we as Christians you
[1:04:34] know we we should
[1:04:37] identify with the word of God with the
[1:04:40] promises and and see ourselves in the
[1:04:43] scriptures like Jesus said search the
[1:04:46] scriptures for in them you you think you
[1:04:49] have eternal life they're testifying of
[1:04:51] me and if we can see where they're
[1:04:54] testifying of him
[1:04:56] as the groom we should also be able to
[1:04:58] see where they're testifying of us as
[1:05:01] the Bride of Jesus Christ and you know
[1:05:04] brother Brandon would speak on this
[1:05:06] number of times and using his own uh n
[1:05:10] National patriotism and pride and
[1:05:12] identity to contrast with his identity
[1:05:15] with Bible characters brother Bram said
[1:05:17] what this nation is I am I'm proud to be
[1:05:21] that I'm ready to Bear ashamed I'm ready
[1:05:24] to Bear a reproach to an America
[1:05:27] American that's right but I'm double
[1:05:29] that to Jesus Christ all that he ever
[1:05:33] was I am I like to be identified with
[1:05:37] him them Apostles when they came back
[1:05:40] and they were made fun of and and
[1:05:42] everything else you know where where
[1:05:44] they thought it was a great honor to
[1:05:47] Bear the reproach of his name they were
[1:05:50] not ashamed to be identified with him
[1:05:53] when they walked down to the gate called
[1:05:55] Beautiful and said Silver and Gold Have
[1:05:57] I numbered such as I have give I unto
[1:06:00] thee and in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:06:03] rise up and walk and see a crippled man
[1:06:06] then walk and and and and not just walk
[1:06:09] but come leaping and praising God and
[1:06:12] and then they were called into the
[1:06:13] question you know in what name did you
[1:06:15] do this and they said we did it in the
[1:06:18] name of the one you crucified Jesus
[1:06:20] Christ it is him that has made this man
[1:06:24] both both whole and well you see they
[1:06:27] were not ashamed to be identified with
[1:06:30] him then they had to testify this about
[1:06:33] them said we know these men they are
[1:06:36] unlearned and and they don't they don't
[1:06:38] know any better but we can tell you one
[1:06:40] thing about them they have been with
[1:06:41] Jesus and that ought to be the thing
[1:06:44] that identifies us today that we have
[1:06:48] been with Jesus amen and when we have
[1:06:51] been with Jesus we're going to match
[1:06:53] what the word of God says we're going to
[1:06:56] believe the word of God what the word
[1:06:58] said and we're going to find our
[1:06:59] identity in the scripture now so we
[1:07:03] should be very happy today to be
[1:07:06] identified with the word which is Christ
[1:07:10] identified with him we've been baptized
[1:07:12] into him that's why we baptized taking
[1:07:15] on the name of Jesus Christ nobody was
[1:07:19] ever baptized in any other way in the
[1:07:21] Bible than in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:23] Christ like a h wife takes on a
[1:07:26] husband's name and identifies with him
[1:07:28] like a child born in a family takes on
[1:07:31] the father's name and identified with
[1:07:33] him when we're born into the family of
[1:07:35] God we take on the name of Jesus Christ
[1:07:38] we become identified with him we are
[1:07:41] identified with his death by being
[1:07:44] buried in the water we we raise up from
[1:07:47] there to be identified in his
[1:07:49] resurrection we come out of there to
[1:07:51] walk in the newness of Life identified
[1:07:55] with him
[1:07:56] so to be a Christian you know we we were
[1:07:59] part of God before the world began we
[1:08:02] were in God's thinking we got the we got
[1:08:06] the you know we got this a brand new
[1:08:09] case of oldtime religion because we were
[1:08:13] in God's mind and he saw us when the
[1:08:17] sons of God shouted for
[1:08:19] Joy amen when when the Morning Star is
[1:08:22] sang together before the foundation in
[1:08:25] the world he saw us right here in time
[1:08:29] right here in this last day shouting
[1:08:33] rejoicing believing expressing the
[1:08:36] promise of God standing on the truth
[1:08:39] amen declaring he's my healer my

[1:11:44] things that are coming on the
[1:11:49] earth amen we can be
[1:11:52] identified again with we can we can and

[1:11:58] were prophesying of us yes oh that's
[1:12:01] what I want you to see yes I want you to
[1:12:04] see they're the prophecy you are the
[1:12:09] interpretation amen you well I don't
[1:12:12] believe in tongues and interpretation
[1:12:14] well this was in tongues it was a
[1:12:17] mystery they didn't even know what they
[1:12:19] were doing they had no
[1:12:22] clue come on when Abraham to his son
[1:12:25] Isaac up on the hill upon the mountain
[1:12:27] on Mount Mariah and there would begin to
[1:12:30] offer his son he didn't know he was
[1:12:35] prophesy amen he didn't know in the
[1:12:37] moment of that test that he was speaking
[1:12:40] and foretelling of the Redeemer coming
[1:12:43] where that where that God himself would
[1:12:46] send his own son amen and dare through
[1:12:50] Redemption redeem
[1:12:52] us come on amen but you see you see they
[1:12:57] didn't know they were prophesying but
[1:12:59] they were prophesying they were the
[1:13:03] tongues we are the
[1:13:06] interpretation I'm looking at today
[1:13:09] interpretation of the word of God the
[1:13:11] Divine
[1:13:13] interpretation of God's
[1:13:16] word that's who you
[1:13:18] are now we can say then I was with
[1:13:23] Abraham when at the age Jus 75 and his
[1:13:26] wife being 65 and told they were going
[1:13:29] to have a baby I was with him when he
[1:13:31] took his stand on thus say the Lord you
[1:13:34] know I'm standing right there
[1:13:36] too amen I'm standing right there in the
[1:13:39] day where an old
[1:13:41] woman a 2,000 year old church that has
[1:13:45] been Barren holding a promise for many
[1:13:48] years sometimes giving up on it and

[1:14:36] you to understand this is the word of
[1:14:38] God that that is
[1:14:40] testifying amen you know I I I I can

[1:14:55] laughed I can identify when Sarah
[1:14:58] laughed in her
[1:15:00] heart I can identify with Sarah

[1:15:05] promise but God never going back on the
[1:15:09] promise come on amen he could not bless
[1:15:13] her in her doubt so what did he do he
[1:15:15] changed her from doubt to Faith neither
[1:15:18] could God bless you in your doubts so
[1:15:20] God has done what he's done in this
[1:15:22] generation to change you from outting to

[1:17:08] a moment in a twinkling of an eye amen
[1:17:11] that when we stand there on that day
[1:17:14] we're going to
[1:17:15] [Applause]
[1:17:17] laugh in fact of the matter is the Bible
[1:17:20] said we're going to laugh at the
[1:17:23] Devil amen and the in the book of Isaiah
[1:17:26] said we will look down in the pit at him
[1:17:28] and we will laugh and said is this the

[1:18:18] Gyra
[1:18:20] amen you know and and you know Jehovah
[1:18:23] Gyra in his original meaning means on
[1:18:26] the top of the mountain it will be

[1:18:34] same Mountain some thousands of years

[1:18:49] mountain amen upon the mount it shall be
[1:18:52] seen but it also means Jehovah the

[1:19:41] return amen I've got that same kind of
[1:19:44] Faith you've got that same kind of Faith
[1:19:47] we're identified with that amen but
[1:19:51] there on the top of the mountain to know
[1:19:53] him as Jehovah
[1:19:55] gy you've seen him in your life you've
[1:19:59] witnessed him in your life many times
[1:20:01] where he

[1:20:06] where he was El shedi amen the god of
[1:20:09] more than enough I want to tell you
[1:20:12] about your God this morning amen he'll
[1:20:14] reveal himself to you like he did to
[1:20:16] Abraham I'm more than
[1:20:18] enough I'm not just your healer I'm your
[1:20:21] Miracle Worker I'll turn the impossible
[1:20:25] situations around amen I'll deliver you

[1:20:40] Doubt with so many in the Bible and I
[1:20:42] don't know that I would have time to go
[1:20:44] through all of them so I'm just going to
[1:20:45] hit a few high points but if we think
[1:20:48] about Jacob Jacob here he he would
[1:20:52] wrestle all night with an Angel
[1:20:55] I'm identified with that amen I had that
[1:20:59] time too where I I was in that same
[1:21:01] shape so were you amen you were you were
[1:21:05] there a liar a thief a heel Grabber you
[1:21:08] know that that's kind of thing with with
[1:21:10] with him he always wanted the birthright
[1:21:12] it was seemed like always out of his
[1:21:14] reach and that's the way it seem
[1:21:16] sometimes sometimes with a lot of us
[1:21:18] Jacobs we can't quite just can't quite
[1:21:22] grasp a hold of it and we'll cheat and
[1:21:25] we'll do this and we'll try that and
[1:21:27] we'll do something else but it's all
[1:21:29] because beating on the inside of you all
[1:21:31] the time was a real Prince of
[1:21:35] God Amen you just had the wrong identity
[1:21:38] you were identified as a Jacob as a
[1:21:41] deceiver of someone of the world Amen
[1:21:43] but it would take this encounter with
[1:21:45] God that would change your identity and
[1:21:47] make you know you're not a
[1:21:50] deceiver amen you're not a sinner you're
[1:21:52] not intended to be lost you are a child
[1:21:55] of the most high God you are a prince a
[1:22:00] [Applause]

[1:22:09] cuz I'm his
[1:22:11] brother amen and I'll tell you what
[1:22:15] after that wrestle you walk
[1:22:18] different you go in walking one way and
[1:22:21] then the angel touches you in the hollow
[1:22:22] of the hip and you come out walking a
[1:22:24] different way everybody can tell you've
[1:22:26] been with the
[1:22:29] angel your walk is different amen if you
[1:22:32] said well I've met the angel I I've got
[1:22:34] the spirit of God brother Tim I've been
[1:22:36] born again and you still living the same
[1:22:39] old dirty life let me tell you you
[1:22:40] hadn't met the
[1:22:42] angel once you ever made the angel there
[1:22:45] and wrestling out with him your life
[1:22:47] will be changed forever you come out
[1:22:49] walking different talking different
[1:22:52] acting different
[1:22:54] amen
[1:22:56] amen my goodness you know as we as we
[1:23:00] look at this as the Bible as a Bible
[1:23:04] unfolds we can go quickly on down to
[1:23:07] Joseph in the Bible Joseph was rejected
[1:23:11] of his Brethren are you identified with
[1:23:14] him amen you know there again because
[1:23:17] this boy was spiritual and the rest were
[1:23:19] carnal that made him become rejected
[1:23:22] that's what brother brandham said you
[1:23:23] know just just let a Christian
[1:23:25] acknowledge the things of God and live
[1:23:28] right and true and believe in the gifts
[1:23:30] of the Spirit and the working of the
[1:23:32] Holy Ghost he's going to be persecuted
[1:23:35] he's going to be rejected and Joseph was
[1:23:37] rejected because he was spiritual it was
[1:23:40] because of that jealousy that would
[1:23:43] cause them all to go down to Egypt and
[1:23:45] wind up being
[1:23:47] slaves because because they they um they
[1:23:51] were rejected Joseph and and the
[1:23:55] spiritual boy that he was amen but I was
[1:23:58] with him when he knew the reproach he
[1:24:01] had to stand by his
[1:24:03] Brethren amen you see what he was I am
[1:24:07] for we're all one in Christ I know what
[1:24:10] it is to Bear the
[1:24:12] reproach someone said to me he said
[1:24:15] brother Jim you know what do you think
[1:24:17] when speak people talk bad about you and
[1:24:20] and and castigate and talk down about
[1:24:22] you I said comes with the turf
[1:24:27] it's just part of it amen it's just part
[1:24:30] of being a Christian being a child of
[1:24:32] God for standing for
[1:24:34] truth amen the Bible tells us to beware
[1:24:37] when all men speak well of
[1:24:39] us amen but I tell you woe to them from
[1:24:43] whom offenses come touch my my anointing
[1:24:47] and do my profits no harm for he said
[1:24:50] I'll rebuke Kings for their sake so you
[1:24:53] see I was I was with Joseph and there
[1:24:56] when when he was rejected of his
[1:24:58] Brethren when he was sold as a slave and
[1:25:01] where that he he went there and yet a
[1:25:04] son of prosperity you know I'm looking
[1:25:07] at sons of prosperity this morning those
[1:25:10] who prosper in spite of what the devil
[1:25:14] tries amen the devil would do everything
[1:25:17] falsely accuse you throw you into prison
[1:25:20] and do you unjustly and whatever and
[1:25:22] everywhere you go you get blessed
[1:25:28] I remember some years ago I had I had
[1:25:30] some some people that that came and it
[1:25:34] was a man that he claimed to be one of
[1:25:35] the prophets that was going to go to
[1:25:38] Israel and he was had lived in a cave
[1:25:40] for three and a half years over there
[1:25:42] and you know and he came there and he he
[1:25:45] came and was trying to spread his little
[1:25:46] stuff around the church so I just
[1:25:48] invited him home with me
[1:25:56] I just invited him home with me I said
[1:25:58] uh hey you know come home with me so I
[1:26:01] sat down with him for a little bit and
[1:26:03] we talked and I went be went over some
[1:26:05] things with him and tried to explain
[1:26:08] finally I just I just put my fa my
[1:26:10] finger in his face I said listen you
[1:26:12] know I'm going to do like they did in
[1:26:14] the book of in the Book of Revelation I
[1:26:17] said they tried them that said they were
[1:26:18] Apostles and were not and found them
[1:26:20] liars and I said because they were not
[1:26:23] saying what Paul said you're not saying
[1:26:25] what the prophet of God said so you're a
[1:26:27] liar and the reason I had you to my home
[1:26:30] was to keep you away from the
[1:26:33] people and you know he began to began to
[1:26:36] speak curses upon me and I just smiled
[1:26:39] and I said curse me please keep on
[1:26:42] cursing me because the more you curse me
[1:26:45] the more I will BL be blessed God will
[1:26:48] turn every one of your curses into a
[1:26:51] blessing you you see you cannot curse a
[1:26:53] child God God will bless you every time
[1:26:58] men revile you don't worry about it
[1:27:01] don't fight against it amen just let
[1:27:04] them do whatever they want to do as
[1:27:07] brother Ram talked about it he said when
[1:27:09] Jesus was on his way to Calvary and they
[1:27:12] were mocking him he never stopped he
[1:27:14] never he never looked around he never
[1:27:16] answered them he kept just going right
[1:27:19] on he said he had too big a job to do
[1:27:22] than to listen to their scoffing
[1:27:24] he said big men don't listen to that I
[1:27:27] said God make us bigger
[1:27:30] men said this is criticizing not
[1:27:33] criticize them hey make us bigger men
[1:27:35] bigger men that just don't even notice
[1:27:37] don't pay any attention to
[1:27:39] scoffing amen because you see there was
[1:27:42] Joseph no matter where he was God
[1:27:44] blessed him prospered him I want you to
[1:27:48] know that's where you are today God's is
[1:27:51] going to prosper you and everything
[1:27:53] never never forget you're a son or
[1:27:55] daughter of
[1:27:56] prosperity amen he's going to prosper
[1:27:58] you in your field he's going to bless
[1:28:00] you in the country he's going to bless
[1:28:02] you in the city I'm telling you amen you
[1:28:06] say well brother Jim what about all
[1:28:07] those curses that follow me he took my
[1:28:11] curses I don't have to worry about the
[1:28:13] curses he took them he became my sin
[1:28:17] that I might become his righteousness so
[1:28:20] therefore I'm inheritance of the
[1:28:21] blessings but not the cursings
[1:28:24] hallelujah amen do you realize you
[1:28:26] cannot be
[1:28:30] cursed amen you are not under a curse
[1:28:33] and you cannot be cursed you're under a
[1:28:38] blessing amen so you see Joseph was in
[1:28:42] prison and yet he was taken from there
[1:28:46] exalted to the right hand of of pharaoh
[1:28:49] you see God will exalt you in due time
[1:28:53] this is the B
[1:28:55] just just wait on the Lord don't don't
[1:28:57] worry about it don't cha wherever you're
[1:29:00] at learn something be a Christian
[1:29:03] wherever you're at if you're in a trial
[1:29:05] be a Christian
[1:29:08] there amen that that's exactly what I

[1:31:07] Bush was what Moses
[1:31:09] lacked you know sometimes we all have
[1:31:12] tried on our own to to make things
[1:31:16] happen to bring a Deliverance Moses did
[1:31:19] that killed one Egyptian and ran for his
[1:31:22] life a failure now and and now out there
[1:31:25] for many many years and thought God had
[1:31:28] forgot his promise God never forgets a
[1:31:32] promise amen God can't forget you he
[1:31:35] said why could a woman forget her
[1:31:37] suckling babe you know you know is that
[1:31:41] is that possible he said yeah that could
[1:31:43] happen but he said I could never forget
[1:31:45] you while your names are engraved on the
[1:31:48] palms of my
[1:31:49] hands come on Amen when he took those
[1:31:53] Nails in his hands he identified himself
[1:31:56] with

[1:32:22] by what a watch shop that you used to be
[1:32:24] in Dixie in and he wanted to stop by
[1:32:26] there and so he puts it and he wraps it
[1:32:28] around his finger and drives with it all
[1:32:30] the way gets to report with it on his

[1:33:46] God speaks to man he gives him a purpose
[1:33:49] when God speaks to man he gives him
[1:33:51] ambition when God speaks to man he gives
[1:33:54] him Faith to do it to accomplish or
[1:33:58] achieve what his purpose in life is what
[1:34:00] God called him to do and he called us to
[1:34:03] be in the Church of God so God didn't
[1:34:06] send us a message and speak to us
[1:34:08] without giving us
[1:34:10] faith without revealing his
[1:34:13] purpose his plan and giving you the

[1:35:28] the Living God it came and indwelled on
[1:35:31] the inside of you and gave you an
[1:35:33] experience that the world didn't give

[1:36:36] an anointing in this day you're anointed
[1:36:40] as adopted sons in an adopted
[1:36:45] age you know Luther Luther Pro was like
[1:36:49] in the church in his infancy coming up
[1:36:52] like the little blade it's in his empy
[1:36:54] and then it and then it comes up in his
[1:36:56] juvenile state with with with um Wesley
[1:37:00] and then it comes up in his teenage
[1:37:02] years with the zeusa street but we're
[1:37:04] not there I don't identify anymore with
[1:37:07] a
[1:37:09] teenager I don't identify as a
[1:37:12] teenager I don't identify as an
[1:37:16] infant I don't identify as an
[1:37:20] adolescent amen I identify as as an
[1:37:23] adopted son placed positioned know who I

[1:37:39] age of adoption we are here and this
[1:37:42] message adopts you into the into the
[1:37:45] into the which which when we mean
[1:37:47] adopted we're we're talking about
[1:37:49] recognizing you as coming to maturity
[1:37:52] manhood
[1:37:54] that amen this is the age of the Bride
[1:37:57] where the bride amen is no longer an
[1:37:59] infant you don't marry an adolescent you
[1:38:01] can't marry a teenager that is too
[1:38:04] immature but we come to a time of
[1:38:06] maturity a bright
[1:38:10] time where that the woman that's turn it
[1:38:13] out in emphas is now
[1:38:16] grown and able to take his life and
[1:38:20] reproduce him
[1:38:23] am bear his
[1:38:29] identity so I was with
[1:38:32] Moses I was with Moses I'm identified
[1:38:36] with
[1:38:37] him and I'll tell you you can be
[1:38:39] identified with Moses when you show his
[1:38:41] sign and the devil just hardens his
[1:38:44] heart and becomes more
[1:38:49] stubborn but I see Moses is a man who
[1:38:52] was anointed
[1:38:54] and he didn't give
[1:38:57] up come on he didn't go and accuse God
[1:39:00] of failure and give up and run back to
[1:39:02] the
[1:39:04] desert he come back with another
[1:39:09] plague come on church amen that's
[1:39:12] exactly what we do when we're identified
[1:39:15] with Moses you take God's promise and
[1:39:17] the devil hardens his heart you just
[1:39:20] come back with another plague release
[1:39:22] another word on him hit him
[1:39:26] again amen till your enem is destroyed
[1:39:29] come on Amen you do it again and again
[1:39:32] if it's one time two times all the way
[1:39:34] to 10 times it doesn't matter you stand
[1:39:37] right there because you've got a Word of
[1:39:39] Promise Let My People
[1:39:43] Go Hallelujah and that's the way we
[1:39:45] stand this morning we're not backing up
[1:39:48] we're not running back to the desert
[1:39:50] we're not like cowards going backwards
[1:39:52] come on we're going
[1:39:53] forward amen we just come back with
[1:39:56] another plague we'll rain we'll rain
[1:39:59] hell down on the
[1:40:02] devil hell yeah we'll bring him his own
[1:40:09] torment and we'll use heaven to do it
[1:40:12] cuz heaven will move
[1:40:16] hell come on church amen Listen to It's
[1:40:21] it's about time it's about time time
[1:40:23] that we as the children of the most high
[1:40:26] God realize that we're not here playing
[1:40:28] games but we are here prophesying to be
[1:40:31] here in this day this is our destiny
[1:40:34] this is our hour this is the day that
[1:40:37] God has caused us to rain we are here to
[1:40:41] reain we are here to
[1:40:46] rule to take Dominion to take
[1:40:50] authority amen so Moses
[1:40:54] down there in Egypt I'm identified with
[1:40:57] him even when the devil hardens his
[1:41:00] heart you stand right
[1:41:02] there I was there too you know you go
[1:41:06] and of course you see a lot of times
[1:41:08] it's that
[1:41:10] away it's so it's so difficult because
[1:41:15] on one hand you got the devil Harden his
[1:41:17] heart Pharaoh hardened his heart
[1:41:20] becoming more stubborn and then the
[1:41:22] people
[1:41:24] saying why did you mess with
[1:41:27] us you made things worse things aren't
[1:41:31] getting better they're getting
[1:41:34] worse I know what it is to be
[1:41:36] misunderstood by Brethren I've been
[1:41:40] there amen but what do you do you go
[1:41:42] right back and just bring another plague
[1:41:44] on the
[1:41:46] devil he don't move this time just bring
[1:41:48] another
[1:41:49] one I'm identified with that that's the
[1:41:53] way we ought to be this morning
[1:41:55] identified as a people who never give
[1:41:58] up who stands right there on the promise
[1:42:01] of God and we keep knocking and we keep
[1:42:04] asking and we keep seeking until the
[1:42:06] door
[1:42:09] opens and
[1:42:12] finally we see identified with Moses
[1:42:16] when he gets the revelation of the
[1:42:18] perfect
[1:42:19] lamb of the
[1:42:22] Passover receiving a lamb without
[1:42:25] blemish I'm identified with that because
[1:42:28] I have come bringing my lamb without
[1:42:36] blemish a worthy
[1:42:39] lamb I've applied the token of the blood
[1:42:42] to the openings of my life to the body
[1:42:45] the spirit the soul just as they applied
[1:42:47] it to the opening of their
[1:42:50] dwellings you see I'm identified them
[1:42:53] with my
[1:42:55] sacrifice as brother brandham told us in
[1:42:57] the token message he said we find our
[1:43:00] identification is with our sacrifice the
[1:43:03] life of the sacrifice is in us which is
[1:43:06] the holy spirit when that cell was broke
[1:43:09] it released God that he Sanctified a
[1:43:12] people with his own blood and put God in
[1:43:16] man again God in you eternal life now
[1:43:20] that's something the Lamb's blood the
[1:43:23] animal blood could not do but the blood
[1:43:25] of
[1:43:26] Jesus Amen release the spirit of God
[1:43:30] Amen and put God in the man
[1:43:34] again hallelujah amen like like anybody
[1:43:38] should know you know that Zoe in the
[1:43:40] Bible Zoe means God's own life he said I
[1:43:46] will give you Eternal or Zoey life God's
[1:43:50] own
[1:43:52] life isn't it amazing to realize we got
[1:43:56] God's life in us that we're attributes
[1:43:58] of his thoughts even before there was a
[1:44:01] foundation of the world and all you was
[1:44:03] in his thinking and now we're at the
[1:44:05] display of his thoughts and his own life
[1:44:08] is now within
[1:44:12] you now back then in moses' day they
[1:44:17] were
[1:44:18] foreshadowing but now we can identify
[1:44:21] ourselves in them in the scripture you
[1:44:25] see Jesus did the same for example let
[1:44:29] me give you an example he said as Jonah
[1:44:33] in was in the belly of the well for
[1:44:36] three days and three nights so shall the
[1:44:39] son of man be in the heart of the
[1:44:41] earth so you see he identified himself
[1:44:45] in that scripture what to others was
[1:44:47] just a story was to him a
[1:44:51] prophecy and Jes Jesus looked at and
[1:44:54] said there's the prophecy I'm the
[1:44:58] interpretation so as Jonah was in the
[1:45:01] belly of the well three three days and
[1:45:03] three nights so will the son of man be
[1:45:05] in the heart of the
[1:45:07] earth so he could look there in a Bible
[1:45:11] character and see himself and his
[1:45:15] victory that's what I'm trying to get
[1:45:17] you to do this morning because you see
[1:45:20] the mystery down to the Ages was Christ
[1:45:23] the mystery now is Christ in
[1:45:27] you amen amen I I you know what what I
[1:45:31] want to do is I want to see those Bible
[1:45:32] characters come live out in your
[1:45:35] life I want to I want to bring out the
[1:45:37] David that's in your
[1:45:39] life amen come on the Giant Slayer I
[1:45:43] want to bring out the Moses in your life
[1:45:45] the deliverer amen come on I want I want
[1:45:48] to bring out the Enoch in your life I I
[1:45:51] want to bring out those they're there
[1:45:54] come on if you got Christ in you because
[1:45:56] that was Christ in them amen if you got
[1:45:59] Christ in you you it can be brought out
[1:46:02] what is in there when you when you meet
[1:46:04] a obstacle when you come against an
[1:46:06] enemy when the when the thousands come
[1:46:09] against you you can stand right there on
[1:46:11] the promise of God and see the word come
[1:46:15] to the Forefront for his children and
[1:46:18] display your
[1:46:20] token your identification yes that
[1:46:24] you're identified with
[1:46:26] Christ now it was Christ all the way
[1:46:29] down to the Old Testament and finally
[1:46:32] finally you see he was the fullness of
[1:46:36] the godhead
[1:46:38] bodily so all that was in him in them
[1:46:42] came in
[1:46:43] Jesus see David had the
[1:46:46] Psalms Solomon had the
[1:46:49] wisdom the the prophets had the
[1:46:51] prophecies Moses had the law but now it
[1:46:55] comes all encapsulated in one
[1:46:59] body Jesus
[1:47:01] Christ so he becomes the wisdom of
[1:47:04] Solomon the Psalms of David the law of
[1:47:09] Moses the pro Prophecies of the prophets
[1:47:13] he becomes all encapsulated he's the
[1:47:17] fullness see they had been working out
[1:47:19] it was God's revelation and then from
[1:47:22] there as as you see in restoration God
[1:47:25] does the same thing until again we
[1:47:29] become the fullness of the scripture
[1:47:31] because now the fullness of the godhead
[1:47:34] bodily dwells within the church amen
[1:47:38] because all the scripture is in her so
[1:47:40] you see Jesus had to come in order to
[1:47:43] take away sin and no one else could do
[1:47:46] it no one else was worthy to do it there
[1:47:49] was none other none other man that was
[1:47:52] out blim but him he was holy un without
[1:47:56] blemish
[1:47:58] undefiled amen no one else could do it
[1:48:01] no one else was worthy and when and and
[1:48:04] he did it and when he did that life was
[1:48:08] released from that body of that man
[1:48:10] which was the son of God remember God's
[1:48:13] creative power made a
[1:48:16] building like a contractor he built a
[1:48:18] building that God moved himself into
[1:48:23] and then when that life was taken the
[1:48:26] blood the chemistry poured on the ground
[1:48:28] like Abel's poured out on the ground but
[1:48:31] from that blood came the Holy Spirit and
[1:48:35] was sent a man that on the day of
[1:48:37] Pentecost to be identified with the
[1:48:40] sacrifice that died for them you see
[1:48:43] there's no other way we can get it it's
[1:48:45] a positive token it's a true
[1:48:48] identification so we're identified with
[1:48:50] him as the groom was prefigured in them
[1:48:55] so is the
[1:48:57] bride therefore we
[1:49:01] know we know we're like them in that
[1:49:04] Exodus brother Brandon we call this the
[1:49:07] Third
[1:49:08] Exodus and we know we're like them in
[1:49:11] that Exodus we're going out when the day
[1:49:15] Dawns and the trumpet sounds remember
[1:49:19] they were to stay in their their
[1:49:21] dwellings eat the Passover
[1:49:23] until the day dawned and the trumpet
[1:49:26] sound when the trumpet sound everybody's
[1:49:29] ready to March we're
[1:49:33] leaving amen are you ready for the
[1:49:37] trumpet amen we've heard you shout it's
[1:49:40] a mighty message it's a prophet bringing
[1:49:43] a message of restoration that speaks a
[1:49:46] bride into existence then it becomes
[1:49:49] manifested in Bride form who becomes The
[1:49:52] Voice
[1:49:54] Hallelujah are you the voice of the
[1:49:56] Resurrection I was dead but now I'm
[1:50:00] alive I was in prison in tombs of
[1:50:04] denominationalism but the the doors have
[1:50:06] been blasted open and now I come and
[1:50:09] you'll never seal the bride of Christ
[1:50:11] back in any tomb
[1:50:15] again Hallelujah you'll never go back to
[1:50:18] the tomb that can't seal you there's not
[1:50:21] enough seals to put on you to keep you
[1:50:23] in a Baptist tomb a Methodist tomb my
[1:50:26] Pinnacles of Tomb you raised up out of
[1:50:29] there fly up never to go back in it
[1:50:33] again amen you are the
[1:50:37] resurrection you are its
[1:50:44] voice I was dead but behold I am alive
[1:50:49] forever more and I've got the keys to
[1:50:51] Satan's eeden
