[38:19] Freedom amen and I and but we have a
[38:22] purpose and that purpose is we're being

[38:31] more Glory from Glory unto Glory he's
[38:33] changing us amen you know brother
[38:36] brandom talks about the Emancipation
[38:38] Proclamation uh when the slaves were he
[38:41] said our C colored Breen and sisters in
[38:44] the South when they used to have slavery
[38:47] he said when the Emancipation
[38:48] Proclamation was signed here they'd been
[38:51] whipped and beat and so forth and been
[38:53] slaves and they said at a certain
[38:55] morning he I don't remember the date but
[38:57] that morning you're going to be free and
[39:00] you're free at Sun up and when the Sun
[39:02] rises all the slaves could go free this
[39:06] poor decrepit heartbeat slaves no doubt
[39:09] were very anxious to be free amen that
[39:12] to you know because it wasn't their
[39:14] purpose their purpose in life was not to
[39:16] be a slave amen but their purpose was to
[39:19] be a a man or a woman of Freedom Amen to
[39:23] live life as they would see fit but here
[39:26] they found them themselves in slavery he
[39:28] said and so their their their hearts
[39:30] were beating towards freedom and and
[39:32] said they had was so anxious to maybe
[39:34] one of the strongest one of them climbed
[39:36] up to the top of the hill to get that
[39:39] first glimpse of the Dawn as it would
[39:41] come over the horizon ones quite not so
[39:44] strong would climb down a little further
[39:47] and the women the children on down and
[39:48] those great big strong men were able to
[39:51] go up to the top and stood there before
[39:53] Daybreak and they looked and they looked
[39:55] and after the they begin to see the
[39:57] streaks of that sun rising and they
[40:01] begin to re relay it down into the
[40:03] valley one holler from the top we're
[40:05] free and the next one holler down we're
[40:08] free all the way down in the valley
[40:10] we're free why the Sun is up and they
[40:13] let off the pressure and screamed and
[40:15] shouted to the top of their voices
[40:18] because they were free the Sun is up
[40:21] that was the Su n he said but old
[40:23] brother now the S so n is up
[40:27] we're free Hallelujah the signs of his
[40:30] resurrection is Right Among Us Jesus
[40:33] Christ the same yesterday today and
[40:34] forever he's not dead but he's alive
[40:37] forever more the Sun is up and I I was
[40:40] thinking on that for a moment and
[40:42] reading this in the back back there and
[40:44] how they brother brandom depicts it as
[40:46] they begin to scream and shout at the
[40:49] top of their voices because they were
[40:51] free the sun was up and he said again
[40:54] that was the Su in so how much more us
[40:57] seeing the so n is risen among us should
[41:00] there be a shout in our hearts and our
[41:02] lives and and a victory amen because
[41:05] that's not our our purpose was not to be
[41:07] people of slavery our our purpose was
[41:10] not to serve sin as a slave but our
[41:12] purpose was to be in the image of
[41:14] almighty God but we know as it were we
[41:17] were sold into slavery and and we were
[41:19] bound and born in sin and shaping
[41:21] iniquity but in this day amen the power
[41:24] of God has been given once again to
[41:26] break the shackles of sin off of our
[41:28] lives and we can scream out as those
[41:30] slaves did aund or so years ago the S so
[41:33] n is up we were once slaves to sin we
[41:37] were once slaves to church denominations
[41:39] or church anties and all these things

[42:01] in life was not to be beat by a whip or
[42:04] to be bound by change or or to be bound
[42:07] and and serve a certain man but their

[42:16] sin our purpose was not to be slaves to
[42:19] churchianity or or church ideas or
[42:22] church Creeds amen but we can declare

[45:19] up he said I see a lady with a white
[45:21] cane in front maybe a blind woman

[45:29] diseases that's going to kill you but
[45:32] you lose all thought of Freedom as soon
[45:34] as the doctor says it's
[45:38] incurable you think you'll never be free
[45:40] from it but there is a Healer in our
[45:43] midst amen there's a chain breaker in

[46:06] you've been held by generational curses
[46:08] but I can tell you there's somebody here
[46:10] that can deliver you from those
[46:13] things Hallelujah he said why brother if
[46:16] we could ever come in the presence of
[46:18] God like Moses did he said it
[46:21] revolutionized him yes

[46:27] need to be so changed to where we lose
[46:29] our human amen human ability to think
[46:32] listen it wasn't human thinking that got
[46:35] Moses and his donkey and his wife and
[46:37] his rod and started going down to Egypt
[46:40] to take over that wasn't human thinking
[46:42] human thinking would have pushed him
[46:44] back to you're crazy get back in your
[46:46] tent but it was the angel of God that
[46:48] met him in a burning bush and it changed
[46:51] his thinking it changed his thoughts
[46:53] even about himself and about the the
[46:55] people of God and about what he was
[46:57] going to do it was the light that put a
[47:00] purpose in him and it was a light that
[47:03] drove him to that purpose of
[47:05] Liberty Hallelujah I pray that same
[47:08] light will come tonight and it'll show
[47:11] you it'll change your
[47:13] thinking Hallelujah I ain't somebody
[47:16] that's supposed to be bound by
[47:17] depression I'm not somebody that's
[47:19] supposed to be bound by pornography I'm
[47:21] not somebody that's that's not who I am
[47:24] I met a l
[47:26] and that light has told me you're not
[47:28] here for this purpose but you're here
[47:30] for The Spar son or daughter of
[47:34] God he said I think of a man or woman
[47:38] could ever step into the light of the
[47:40] Holy Spirit my he said the light of that
[47:44] angel of God standing on that mountain
[47:46] that day everything that he once ever
[47:48] thought never would happen it came to
[47:52] reality cuz he stepped into that light
[47:56] Hallelujah you said well I'll never be
[47:58] free from this brother Timothy step into
[48:00] the
[48:02] light amen he said I think if men or
[48:06] women today could ever step into the
[48:08] light of the Holy Spirit under the
[48:10] unction of God's spirit and the light of
[48:12] God's word everything that God has
[48:14] promised will illuminate to you and be
[48:17] real
[48:19] again maybe you've let the old Promises
[48:22] of God die off for a little while and
[48:24] they're not real but if you'll let the
[48:25] light of God come and illuminated again
[48:28] it will become real to you again amen

[48:44] become real that he's the same yesterday
[48:46] today and forever if you let that light
[48:50] illuminate you it'll become reality
[48:52] again he said that's the reason Moses
[48:54] failed in the first place here was what
[48:56] the matter it was it was a lack of
[48:59] having what the burning bush
[49:03] had Hallelujah that's our failure today
[49:07] is a lack of having what the Holy Spirit
[49:10] has the Holy Spirit has all good things
[49:13] for us and if we receive the Holy Spirit
[49:16] then all things are possible and not
[49:19] only possible but promised to us Jesus

[58:26] much power today to heal Genie Camp as
[58:29] it did Atlanta bu he got just as much
[58:32] power today to heal Ron Spencer amen
[58:35] that is not their
[58:38] purpose their purpose is a son and
[58:41] daughter of the
[58:42] [Applause]
[58:51] king he says that's the way no matter
[58:53] how much the devil tempt you to do
[58:55] anything contrary is anchored no matter
[58:57] how much the enemy would cause you to
[58:59] try to live the wrong life you're
[59:00] anchored forever when you stepped into
[59:02] his presence into a Divine Light that
[59:07] let me read this real slow that changed
[59:10] your innermost being and put a joy and
[59:14] Bell of Salvation ringing in your heart
[59:17] that the world knows nothing about but
[59:19] you pass from death into life death and
[59:22] his Shadows have left you and you become
[59:25] a new creature when you stepped into
[59:27] this Divine
[59:30] Light the light told you of your purpose
[59:33] what you was really here for Darkness
[59:35] was trying to tell you that's who you
[59:36] was and that's who you're going to be
[59:38] and you're just going to die and you're
[59:40] going to take your own life or whatever
[59:42] Darkness tries to say but light begins
[59:44] to pulsate Amen in Matthew 4:16 it said
[59:48] the people which set in darkness saw a
[59:50] great light and to them which set in
[59:52] region in the shadow of death light is
[59:54] sprung R up amen just because you're in
[59:57] darkness does not mean there's not light
[1:00:00] somewhere and light is shining out in
[1:00:02] the dark we live we live in the in the
[1:00:05] darkest time there's ever
[1:00:06] been we've been on this you go back
[1:00:09] talking about light and and the reason
[1:00:11] why it's so dark is because light is
[1:00:13] pushing against
[1:00:15] it sure darkness is congealing and
[1:00:18] trying to trying to bring his forces
[1:00:20] together to stop the light but light
[1:00:22] always overcomes of death
[1:00:26] there's death the the world has a smell
[1:00:28] of death on
[1:00:31] it each time we hear an ulous scream or
[1:00:35] we pass a cemetery or look at the news
[1:00:37] nowadays or hospital or every gray hair
[1:00:41] it marks in our memories that we are a
[1:00:44] doomed people as far as the people of
[1:00:47] this Earth the both young and old would
[1:00:50] come on today we come to a service like
[1:00:53] this to gather hopes
[1:00:55] amen and and and what we're here for and
[1:00:58] what is the purpose of being here he
[1:01:00] said I think that this is a wonderful
[1:01:02] time to think on the hopes that God has
[1:01:05] given us the darkness that we're living
[1:01:07] in it's a wonderful time to stop for a
[1:01:10] minute and think about the hope God has
[1:01:12] given us now we want to draw this first
[1:01:14] in our mind this is the first thing in
[1:01:16] our mind that there is not one thing
[1:01:18] that can destroy us unto the purpose of
[1:01:21] he who created us has been fulfilled
[1:01:27] Hallelujah there could be nothing we are
[1:01:30] made for a
[1:01:33] purpose this church was built here for a

[1:04:49] without all the body being here

[1:04:57] figured it out by now just ain't heard
[1:04:58] about it but you have what is that the
[1:05:00] spleen or something that is it the
[1:05:01] spleen they don't know some somewhere

[1:05:30] put me in the body I have a
[1:05:34] purpose and then when you realize you
[1:05:36] have a purpose then you'll realize
[1:05:38] there's freedom in your
[1:05:40] purpose there's here there's Deliverance
[1:05:42] right there when you find out God put me
[1:05:45] here for a reason that's right I might

[1:05:50] musicians I might not be the Deacon I
[1:05:52] not might not be the song leader I might
[1:05:54] not be the body parts that are seen

[1:06:03] [Applause]
[1:06:06] die amen my fingers here is for a
[1:06:10] purpose your nail on your fingers for a
[1:06:12] purpose your eye every part is for your
[1:06:15] body to serve a purpose if it was not
[1:06:18] put there just see what would look like
[1:06:19] it was not there the skin on the bottom
[1:06:22] of your feet for a purpose
[1:06:25] try walking with some skin missing it
[1:06:29] hurts it's important it might be the
[1:06:32] lowest of the lowest and some of the
[1:06:34] nastiest smelling stuff can stink
[1:06:37] sometimes so bad but it has a
[1:06:40] purpose I'm not going to try to apply
[1:06:42] that to us but I'm just going to say
[1:06:43] what it is if you are just the skin
[1:06:46] that's all you can find of yourself is
[1:06:48] the lowest of the lowest of the low I'm
[1:06:50] Just a Nobody we need you
[1:06:55] and if you find out that that is your
[1:06:57] purpose God put you here for you'll
[1:06:59] realize that when that body of Christ
[1:07:01] that foot goes down every Devil's under
[1:07:03] you
[1:07:05] sir so if you are the bottom of the
[1:07:07] bottom of the bottom of the bottom
[1:07:09] you're every devil is still under
[1:07:11] you when the weakest of Christians goes
[1:07:14] upon their knees all of Hell trembles
[1:07:18] amen why because it's a part of the
[1:07:20] great body of Christ and it's serving
[1:07:22] his purpose and when you realize what
[1:07:24] your purpose is you will find your
[1:07:27] [Applause]
[1:07:32] Liberty people get so bound up because
[1:07:35] they want something different but God's
[1:07:37] ordained them to be this and that's why
[1:07:40] they're bound up amen if they realize
[1:07:42] what their purpose is and why they're
[1:07:44] here he said if we if we were put here
[1:07:46] for a purpose then nothing can destroy
[1:07:49] us until God's purpose was fulfilled
[1:07:52] nothing can harm us until that purpose
[1:07:54] is fulfilled that God has put us here
[1:07:56] for and has been made manifest no matter
[1:07:59] how much trouble we have how much
[1:08:01] heartaches how many Sorrows we go
[1:08:03] through all of these are for reasons and
[1:08:05] there's a reason for
[1:08:08] it hello somebody there's a reason for
[1:08:11] you going through the issues that you're
[1:08:13] going through there's a situation that
[1:08:15] is happening and why I don't know if I
[1:08:18] have time to it but there's a
[1:08:22] reason we were made to be Eagles I'll
[1:08:25] just jump over in there for a moment and
[1:08:28] brother BR talks about it and the eagle
[1:08:29] stirring his neet he said an eagle was
[1:08:31] not born just for a
[1:08:33] nest where it's all fluffy and it's all
[1:08:36] nice and neat and it's all no but sooner
[1:08:38] or later Mama Eagle comes by and starts
[1:08:40] pulling that feather them feathers out
[1:08:42] and that lamb skin out or that rabbit
[1:08:44] skin out and the next thing you know
[1:08:46] there's stickers everywhere why because
[1:08:48] he knows she knows that your duty or
[1:08:51] your purpose is not to just sit in a
[1:08:53] nest somewhere but to fly into the
[1:08:56] heavenlies so he allows things to come
[1:08:58] by our way Amen to test us to try us why
[1:09:02] because he wants you to start putting
[1:09:03] confidence in the two Wings God's giv
[1:09:06] you you see brother so and so flying and
[1:09:10] you see sister so so flying but God
[1:09:12] wants you to know you can fly
[1:09:14] too he wants you to know you wasn't born
[1:09:17] as a Earthbound creature but you were
[1:09:19] born for the
[1:09:22] heavenlies
[1:09:24] so everything has a
[1:09:28] purpose and everything will serve its
[1:09:31] purpose everything has a reason for it
[1:09:35] as we've read before every for every
[1:09:37] season and time things serve their
[1:09:39] purpose there's a time to die a time to
[1:09:41] all you know the scripture everything
[1:09:43] has it we take for an instance Noah in
[1:09:46] the Bible it was a flood that came on
[1:09:49] the Earth was destroyed vegetation
[1:09:50] everything was destroyed but Noah and
[1:09:52] the seed had taken the ark why because
[1:09:55] God's purpose can never be
[1:09:59] defeated Hallelujah his seed will go
[1:10:03] on right there's nothing that can defeat
[1:10:06] it so happy we how happy ought we to be
[1:10:08] today resting upon that beautiful
[1:10:10] revelation of the word of the Living God
[1:10:12] that there's neither things present nor
[1:10:14] things to come there's no sickness no
[1:10:17] sorrow no death no perils no nothing can
[1:10:19] separate us from the purpose of the
[1:10:21] Living God what God is imagining his
[1:10:23] mind what God has purposed in his heart
[1:10:26] to bring to pass there is no demon
[1:10:28] that's there is no power there is
[1:10:32] nothing that can ever separate God's
[1:10:34] Great and Mortal Eternal plan it must be
[1:10:37] as God has
[1:10:41] declared then we find that in the days
[1:10:44] of all the world was going to be
[1:10:46] destroyed God made a preparation if his
[1:10:49] if his purpose was not going to be
[1:10:50] defeated then he had to make a way for
[1:10:52] it not to be that's right so he makes a
[1:10:55] preparation to conserve his purpose to
[1:10:58] conserve a church to conserve a people
[1:11:00] he will conserve subjects for his great
[1:11:02] domain the death that death cannot
[1:11:04] destroy and we realize that this is by
[1:11:07] faith that we believe this but the
[1:11:08] resurrection produces a solid foundation
[1:11:11] on which our faith rest nothing can
[1:11:13] destroy as a poet wrote Oh What A
[1:11:15] foraste of Glory Divine heir of
[1:11:18] Salvation purchased of God born of his
[1:11:20] Spirit washed and blood what an
[1:11:21] assurance upon this Solid Rock the
[1:11:24] resurrection of our Lord's blessed lover
[1:11:26] the Lord Jesus nothing can destroy it it
[1:11:29] has been planted it is a seed of God it
[1:11:32] is a purpose of God to give us the
[1:11:34] Blessed Holy
[1:11:37] Spirit Hallelujah so why why do we need
[1:11:41] it why do we got to have it cuz it's our
[1:11:44] vehicle out of
[1:11:47] here just as Noah had the ark we have to
[1:11:51] have the Holy
[1:11:52] Ghost amen it is our vehicle out of here
[1:11:55] and God has a purpose for it because he
[1:11:58] has a table that's been
[1:12:00] prepared Hallelujah and he's got seats
[1:12:03] there and he's got plates there and he
[1:12:05] he's got them exactly how many is going
[1:12:07] to be there so he's determined in his
[1:12:09] mind this one's going to be here this
[1:12:11] one's going to be here that one's going
[1:12:12] to be here and there ain't nothing the
[1:12:14] devil can do about
[1:12:16] it Allelujah he can how he can blow he
[1:12:20] can do whatever he wants to do but he
[1:12:22] cannot put out the purpose of
[1:12:26] God we have God's Eternal purpose oh
[1:12:30] there may be teachers there may be isms
[1:12:31] rise and may be great programs rise
[1:12:33] there may be things that look like that
[1:12:36] it but it'll be destroyed but it can
[1:12:38] that it would be destroyed but it can
[1:12:39] never be destroyed it's the purpose of
[1:12:42] God to see that it
[1:12:44] prevails I'm talking about you it's what
[1:12:47] he's talking about you're the purpose of
[1:12:49] God and he will see that you will
[1:12:52] prevail then it's not up to me and it's
[1:12:55] not up to you whether it's be destroyed
[1:12:56] or not it's up to God we can rest assure
[1:12:59] on it that God will never let his
[1:13:01] Heritage be
[1:13:04] destroyed oh how many's part of the
[1:13:06] family of
[1:13:08] God for it's his purpose to give it to
[1:13:11] us now we would think also today upon
[1:13:14] destruction and trying to destroy God
[1:13:16] has we have Christ on promise we think
[1:13:18] of the Hebrew children when God had
[1:13:20] purposed for them that they were down in
[1:13:22] Babylon the furnace was he heated up
[1:13:24] seven times hotter to destroy the
[1:13:26] purpose of God and Satan was trying to
[1:13:28] destroy and it was heated up but little
[1:13:31] did Shadrach mhach and Abed too no they
[1:13:33] were coming that they were coming out of
[1:13:35] that furnace but they said our God is
[1:13:38] able to deliver us but nevertheless we
[1:13:40] will not bow to that image God had
[1:13:43] somebody who would serve him and his
[1:13:46] purpose would not be defeated fire
[1:13:49] cannot defeat the purpose of
[1:13:52] God
[1:13:58] Hallelujah that ought to give us great
[1:14:00] confidence because this world's about to
[1:14:02] be born burn burned with
[1:14:04] fire and born again with
[1:14:07] fire it's about to be burned but the
[1:14:11] purpose of God will not be
[1:14:13] burned amen therefore we can have
[1:14:16] Liberty in that he said all the hydrogen
[1:14:18] bomb nuclear bombs the world can never
[1:14:20] def defeat the resurrection of his
[1:14:22] church that's right right all the
[1:14:24] explaining away all the mathematics and
[1:14:26] so forth all this intelligence the world
[1:14:28] is disguised through her purpose to do
[1:14:30] something about to destroy the faith of
[1:14:32] God's children it'll never do it the
[1:14:35] faith will live on
[1:14:38] forever Hallelujah it was the purpose of
[1:14:41] God to show that he had power over the
[1:14:43] wild beasts of the field and that's when
[1:14:45] Daniel went into the lion's den and he
[1:14:47] said oh King I'll see you in the morning
[1:14:49] that's right and the King come to look
[1:14:52] and to see and and here Daniel is still
[1:14:54] alive and he said not one of them has
[1:14:56] touched me he said but the angel of God
[1:14:58] has watched over me what was it God
[1:15:02] watching over his purpose watching over
[1:15:05] his seed that they would not
[1:15:09] perish
[1:15:11] Hallelujah you know how that coincides
[1:15:14] with the day with the faith the Living
[1:15:16] Faith of the Living God in his church
[1:15:18] there's something in our hearts that
[1:15:20] speaks that there is a land beyond the
[1:15:22] river
[1:15:25] Hallelujah I cannot put my finger on
[1:15:28] that land and neither can any man but
[1:15:29] there's something within us that tells
[1:15:31] us the grave is not our
[1:15:37] goal Hallelujah dust Thou Art to dust
[1:15:41] returnest was not spoken of the
[1:15:45] Soul Hallelujah it wasn't spoken of the
[1:15:48] Soul it was spoken of this body but
[1:15:52] there's going to be a few people people
[1:15:53] that's alive and remain it's not going
[1:15:55] to go back down into dust but this dust
[1:15:58] this dirt is going to be
[1:16:00] changed cuz God is going to save his
[1:16:05] purpose there's something within us a
[1:16:07] fire that's burning a light that's been
[1:16:09] lit by God and there ain't a breeze from
[1:16:12] hell that can blow it
[1:16:15] out man maybe I need to read that one
[1:16:17] more time again there's something within
[1:16:20] us a fire that's burning a light that's
[1:16:22] been LT by
[1:16:25] God I'm here to tell the world this
[1:16:27] light that's at Eden like Tabernacle was
[1:16:30] not lit by man this is not man's doing
[1:16:34] this is the Lord's doing and it's
[1:16:36] marvelous in our
[1:16:38] eyes you can call it man-made all you
[1:16:41] want to call it man-made but it's not
[1:16:43] man-made it's not man decreed it's not
[1:16:46] man driven it's driven by the spirit of
[1:16:49] the Living
[1:16:51] God and excuse us us if we realize we're
[1:16:55] free excuse us if we realize that the
[1:16:58] chains of sin has been broken off our
[1:17:00] lives and denominational barriers have
[1:17:03] been busted wide open and we can be
[1:17:09] free who the son is set free he's free
[1:17:14] indeed that's right there's no cold
[1:17:17] spells in the church there's no
[1:17:19] indifference among the people no
[1:17:21] persecution of the world that can blow
[1:17:23] out of flame that God has lit
[1:17:28] right oh Big Bad
[1:17:32] Wolf well I'm telling you my house ain't
[1:17:34] built out of
[1:17:37] straw and my my house ain't built out of
[1:17:40] out of wood it's not something that can
[1:17:43] be
[1:17:44] burned CU we know what's going be burned
[1:17:46] will'll be
[1:17:48] burned but my house is built out of
[1:17:50] Eternal

[1:17:55] blow you can howl all you want to howl
[1:17:58] you can scream all you want to scream
[1:17:59] you can say what you want it the only
[1:18:02] thing that'll happen the more you blow

[1:18:08] get come on somebody I ought to put some
[1:18:12] rejoicing maybe you feel like your house
[1:18:14] is about to blow down your flames is

[1:18:18] it is going to only build it brighter
[1:18:21] it's only going to become greater
[1:18:23] because when those things you go through
[1:18:24] what does it do it ought I know what it
[1:18:26] does to a real child of God when you go
[1:18:28] through trials you go through issues in
[1:18:29] your life it makes you dig deeper it
[1:18:32] makes you look into the word and find
[1:18:33] the things of God and look for every
[1:18:35] promise and grab a hold of everything
[1:18:37] what is it doing it's only causing the
[1:18:40] flame to get
[1:18:41] brighter dumb devil if he knew what it
[1:18:44] would really do to a child of God sure
[1:18:46] the fake ones it's going to put them out
[1:18:48] and they're going to go out but those
[1:18:49] that are really built on the Eternal
[1:18:51] Flame of Almighty God he can blow he can
[1:18:54] how he can blow he can blow he can send
[1:18:57] sickness he can send disease he can send
[1:18:59] turmoil he can send torment he can do
[1:19:02] whatever he want to it's just going to
[1:19:04] get greater and greater and greater and
[1:19:07] greater devil you'll never blow out this
[1:19:10] eternal
[1:19:11] [Applause]
[1:19:17] flame the Daniel not knowing what God
[1:19:19] was going to do not knowing whether God
[1:19:22] was going to do but knowing he was able
[1:19:24] to do it knowing there was something
[1:19:26] down inside of him told him so God had a
[1:19:28] purpose and he worked and he had
[1:19:31] everything working to that purpose and
[1:19:34] today no matter how indifferent we seem
[1:19:36] to be at times how strange things go how
[1:19:40] the church gets in this condition that
[1:19:43] condition and all the Divine Purpose of
[1:19:46] God is to it's all Divine Purpose of God
[1:19:49] to mold us and to make us in his own way
[1:19:54] or In His
[1:19:56] Image who knows how to Fashion the
[1:19:59] material more than the
[1:20:03] Creator
[1:20:04] oh there's been great no doubt men great
[1:20:09] Michelangelo different ones that could
[1:20:11] sculpt make images but there's nobody
[1:20:15] like this God who can make an
[1:20:19] image and he knows how to mold you and
[1:20:22] he knows know how to fix you he knows
[1:20:24] how to how to fix the fix the broken
[1:20:27] places as we talked about the other day
[1:20:29] he takes it and he fills those cracks in
[1:20:31] with deity and gold and he moves and
[1:20:33] he's molding he's making why he's got
[1:20:35] you in a in his mind a certain image he
[1:20:37] wants you to
[1:20:41] be we won't all be the same kind the
[1:20:44] same person sure we're going to be in
[1:20:46] the image of God but God has many
[1:20:49] manifestations so we're not going to all
[1:20:51] be little Timothy or little little
[1:20:52] erands or or big errands little Tims
[1:20:55] we're not going to be that we're all
[1:20:58] going to be different but we're all
[1:20:59] going to be
[1:21:02] him God working the Masterpiece one
[1:21:06] right after
[1:21:07] another we all go through different
[1:21:09] things in life we're all broken in
[1:21:11] different places we all go through
[1:21:13] different trials we don't all face
[1:21:15] cancer we don't all face this disease or
[1:21:18] that disease we didn't all smoke we
[1:21:20] didn't all do this we didn't all do that
[1:21:22] that's right but we all
[1:21:24] sin and we all fell short of the glory
[1:21:27] of God but God began to pick us
[1:21:30] up and he began to mold us and make us
[1:21:33] he had an image in his
[1:21:35] mind and when he gets done with you you
[1:21:38] will be a reflection of
[1:21:43] him the Lions could not eat the prophet
[1:21:46] because God sent an
[1:21:50] angel got of put it in our own language
[1:21:53] the cancer can't eat you cuz God sent an
[1:22:00] angel Hallelujah he had an angel
[1:22:03] standing present to protect this Prophet
[1:22:06] because God had a purpose he wanted to
[1:22:08] show that Ste self styled King his
[1:22:11] mighty hand and his purpose I think
[1:22:13] that's what he's Going's going on today
[1:22:16] God is getting a people ready that he
[1:22:18] might show his mighty
[1:22:20] hand come on somebody
[1:22:23] that he might show his mighty hand to
[1:22:25] fulfill his mighty purpose I'm so glad
[1:22:28] this morning he lives in my heart that
[1:22:30] he's not a dead God he's a living God
[1:22:33] and he has a purpose in his
[1:22:36] mind we're here in 2023 why cuz God has
[1:22:40] a purpose for
[1:22:47] it he said yesterday morning I was
[1:22:50] sitting in a barber chair about to get a
[1:22:52] a
[1:22:53] haircut young fell was cutting my
[1:22:56] hair down at the brother Egan's shop he
[1:22:59] says I was just sitting there with my
[1:23:01] head down I would been so tired my
[1:23:03] meetings have been so long and I'm
[1:23:05] trying to get away in the morning for a
[1:23:06] little rest before the next Services
[1:23:08] began I was so tired just seemed like my
[1:23:11] heart was just about to quit beating and
[1:23:14] while I was sitting there all of a
[1:23:16] sudden I could hear everyone talking but
[1:23:18] it seemed like I was out in space
[1:23:20] somewhere I thought have I had a heart
[1:23:22] attack I'm just leaving for the from the
[1:23:25] I thought what what wonder what's taking
[1:23:27] place and I felt my hands they they were
[1:23:29] so numb and my heart seemed like it quit
[1:23:32] beating I thought oh but there's a
[1:23:35] gospel has got to be preached and
[1:23:37] there's no power that can take me until
[1:23:40] God's purpose is fulfilled there's
[1:23:42] nothing that can hurt me not a
[1:23:45] thing until God's purpose is fulfilled
[1:23:48] and when I that is fulfilled I want to
[1:23:51] go with his purpose and when he's
[1:23:53] finished then I am finished also when
[1:23:55] he's finished with me and I'm finished
[1:23:57] with this life when he's finished with
[1:23:59] you you're finished so what's the
[1:24:01] difference he make god holds it all in
[1:24:03] his hand whether you're young whether
[1:24:06] you're old we don't know what God's
[1:24:07] purpose will be filled and fulfilled and
[1:24:09] finished God takes little babies
[1:24:12] sometimes it show that guide their
[1:24:13] little soul over into the other place
[1:24:15] everything he does it for his purpose he
[1:24:17] said now even a sparrow not even a
[1:24:19] sparrow can fall from the heavens
[1:24:21] without him kn everything goes for his
[1:24:24] purpose just at the hour just at the
[1:24:26] time it's in his divine plan nothing can
[1:24:30] destroy
[1:24:32] it and that's what you have to do when
[1:24:34] that Devil's coming at you and death is
[1:24:37] coming up your door you need to look him
[1:24:39] right in ey and say devil you can't take
[1:24:40] me until God's purpose for me is
[1:24:47] finished how was an assurance to Abraham
[1:24:50] after he found God and he found found
[1:24:52] out what his true purpose
[1:24:54] was that in his purpose he was going to
[1:24:57] bring through Abraham and Sarah a son
[1:24:59] that was his true purpose Isaac was
[1:25:02] going to come through Isaac and through
[1:25:05] that seed was going to come the Lord
[1:25:06] Jesus and in this purpose he was
[1:25:09] bringing forth Sarah and Abraham he was
[1:25:11] going to make them a great people and
[1:25:13] bring the son taking the very worst
[1:25:16] persons that could be to do it
[1:25:20] with wow
[1:25:24] H takes a prophet to see that taking the
[1:25:28] very worst people that could be to do it
[1:25:31] with I felt that way
[1:25:34] myself why would he make me who I am
[1:25:37] today seemed like the worst person he
[1:25:39] could take but God has a
[1:25:43] purpose and he's fulfilling his purpose
[1:25:46] sometimes y'all you feel like man I'm
[1:25:48] the worst person how could God ever love
[1:25:50] me how could God ever reach down to
[1:25:54] where I was and find this little lump of
[1:25:56] clay in that Miry pit and reach down and
[1:26:01] pick me
[1:26:02] out who found the worst person seemed
[1:26:06] like he could find to do it with how
[1:26:10] strange God's moves in mysterious
[1:26:13] ways look like if he had wanted to bring
[1:26:16] a child through to the world like that
[1:26:17] he' found some woman that was
[1:26:20] fertile he would found somebody that was
[1:26:24] Abel and
[1:26:25] Abraham they' been married many many
[1:26:28] years and here she was unfertile and God
[1:26:29] picks them
[1:26:31] out she couldn't raise a child even on
[1:26:34] her own she couldn't do it he would have
[1:26:36] got you think he'd got some young woman
[1:26:38] that was fertile could have brought
[1:26:40] forth this child but see God likes to
[1:26:42] display his
[1:26:45] grace that's why he picked us out of the
[1:26:47] my
[1:26:49] clay that's why he got me out of the mud
[1:26:52] he likes to display his grace he likes
[1:26:54] to take something that's nothing and
[1:26:57] make something out of
[1:26:59] it for he's a Creator that's what he
[1:27:03] took in you and I we were nothing we
[1:27:06] might make that he might make children
[1:27:08] of his own out of us who is wretched
[1:27:12] miserable lost blind unlovely to make us
[1:27:18] his lovely
[1:27:19] children it's God's purpose to do so and
[1:27:23] then again it looked like God would have
[1:27:24] took a young woman or a young man to
[1:27:26] done this a young man that that you know
[1:27:28] been married and they they they they
[1:27:30] they could have produced something but
[1:27:32] God took somebody that could produce
[1:27:35] nothing so he could have the
[1:27:40] glory he takes broken
[1:27:43] Humanity It seems impossible to make
[1:27:45] something out of it and raises them
[1:27:48] up and shows the world look what I have
[1:27:54] done shows your family look what I have
[1:27:58] done this wasn't their doing it wasn't
[1:28:01] their own ideas to go leave you and move
[1:28:04] across and to go in somewhere else and
[1:28:05] lose everything but I have brought them
[1:28:08] here for this purpose and I am raising
[1:28:11] them
[1:28:14] up see God chose a man 75 years old and
[1:28:17] a woman 65 years old to do his purpose
[1:28:20] to show that he can be both young and
[1:28:23] old he can do it with both God can still
[1:28:27] and will work out his purpose no matter
[1:28:29] the age no matter the problems no matter
[1:28:32] the sin no matter the trouble no matter
[1:28:35] what if God sees a purpose in it it will
[1:28:38] be
[1:28:42] fulfilled and the Devil comes along and
[1:28:44] says you know what I'm going to delay it
[1:28:46] for a
[1:28:48] while I I'm going to I believe that if I
[1:28:51] get them so old they'll lose faith if I
[1:28:55] get them past where it was promised so
[1:28:58] long they'll finally give up on it say
[1:29:02] well maybe it was just a hope maybe it
[1:29:04] was just a maybe maybe it was just a a
[1:29:08] feeling somebody had it wasn't the
[1:29:10] Lord maybe just Abraham dreamed
[1:29:13] something maybe Sarah you know she just
[1:29:18] thought maybe if I can just delay it
[1:29:21] enough
[1:29:22] maybe they'll quit believing in a
[1:29:25] resurrection if I can just delay it just
[1:29:28] enough and darkness get thick enough and
[1:29:30] get so bad that you can't hardly see the
[1:29:32] hand in front of your face maybe they'll
[1:29:34] quit quit believing that the dead in
[1:29:36] Christ is going to
[1:29:37] rise but God's purpose is going to be
[1:29:41] fulfilled here they already shaking in
[1:29:44] their in their bodies at 75 and here
[1:29:46] they already if I can just keep it away
[1:29:49] for a while if I can just keep it away
[1:29:51] until Abraham and Sarah so stupid in age
[1:29:54] so gray haired so Stoopid shoulder
[1:29:56] they'll just give
[1:29:59] up if I can just keep her here so long
[1:30:03] she'll just give
[1:30:05] up quit praying for the sick quit having
[1:30:09] prayer lines quit having altar calls
[1:30:12] quit a seek seeking after God and asking
[1:30:15] God Save The
[1:30:17] Lost bring the prodal
[1:30:20] home if I can just just delay it long
[1:30:24] enough but
[1:30:26] Abraham believed God yes
[1:30:30] sir
[1:30:32] Hallelujah I can't tell you how much
[1:30:34] that scripture did for me as a young
[1:30:36] preacher when my little boy Andrew is
[1:30:38] laying in the hospital gasping for air
[1:30:41] and a man on the radio reads a scripture
[1:30:43] Abraham believed in God and the devil
[1:30:46] been telling me the whole reason Andrew
[1:30:47] is in the hospital because of something
[1:30:49] i' done or my past and this that and the
[1:30:51] other and I hear this word Abraham
[1:30:53] believed in
[1:30:55] God and I turn the radio off and I I
[1:30:58] begin to shout out to God I said God if
[1:31:01] Abraham could believe you in the
[1:31:03] impossible situation I can also believe
[1:31:05] you cuz I'm a son of
[1:31:08] Abraham and I went back and we I told I
[1:31:11] told sister Ruth I said we're not going
[1:31:12] to look at this signs we're not going to
[1:31:14] look at the monitors we're not going to
[1:31:16] look at nothing we're going to believe
[1:31:17] in God why because God gave me a
[1:31:19] revelation cuz Abraham also had a
[1:31:22] past Abraham also made mistakes Abraham
[1:31:26] also lied he laughed he done all kinds
[1:31:29] of things all kinds of wrongs but when
[1:31:32] it was the New Covenant that came to the
[1:31:35] Covenant that I'm under the blood that
[1:31:37] I'm under it said Abraham believed to
[1:31:40] God and staggered not at the promises of
[1:31:42] God but was strong in the
[1:31:44] faith yes sir Hallelujah and God looks
[1:31:48] through the same blood at me that he
[1:31:50] looks at Abraham cuz his purpose will be
[1:31:54] fulfilled God will have a
[1:31:58] testimony and today we have a testimony
[1:32:01] of a young man amen whose lungs are
[1:32:03] perfect why because we serve a god who's
[1:32:06] a Healer and if the devil can delay you
[1:32:09] enough and make you disbelieve it you'll
[1:32:11] go off into disbelief but if you'll
[1:32:13] stand there and when you done all to
[1:32:16] stand stand therefore and say I believe
[1:32:19] it don't God slay me I'm going to trust
[1:32:22] him he's the one that made the promise
[1:32:24] and his promise will be
[1:32:27] [Applause]
[1:32:30] fulfilled it's his promise it goes to
[1:32:33] show you when you'll stand nothing can
[1:32:35] defeat his purpose not even death can
[1:32:38] defeat his purpose Abraham was as good
[1:32:41] as dead Sarah's womb was dead for 40 or
[1:32:44] 50 years but nothing can defeat God's
[1:32:46] purpose her body was old it was wrinkled
[1:32:50] the milk veins were dried up her heart
[1:32:52] was so weak it could have would not have
[1:32:54] went through labor but God let us know
[1:32:56] that his purpose would not be defeated
[1:32:58] he changed
[1:33:00] Sarah and he made her a young woman
[1:33:02] again and he took a man that was a
[1:33:04] hundred years old and he turned him back
[1:33:06] to youth again no matter how
[1:33:08] unreasonable it may seem God gave the
[1:33:10] promise and Abraham staggered not at the
[1:33:12] promise of God through unbelief but was
[1:33:14] strong in the faith giving God
[1:33:17] praise giving God praise for he judged
[1:33:20] him faithful that he's able to perform
[1:33:23] what he
[1:33:25] promised what should we do today we're
[1:33:28] children of his of the same promise we
[1:33:32] being dead in Christ we're Abraham's
[1:33:33] seed and are HS with him according to
[1:33:35] the promise that no matter how much
[1:33:38] sickness
[1:33:39] comes no matter what kind of death we
[1:33:42] die how much poverty we go through God's
[1:33:46] purpose cannot be
[1:33:50] defeated he he raised us up again
[1:33:53] because I live you shall live also
[1:33:57] that's our hope am that's our hope
[1:34:01] because I live ye shall live oh old
[1:34:04] Abraham could endure as seeing him who
[1:34:06] is invisible because it was the purpose
[1:34:08] of God that he knew that God gave him
[1:34:10] the promise and no matter how contrary
[1:34:12] everything seemed God gave Abraham that
[1:34:15] promise and God fulfilled his promise he
[1:34:18] did to Abraham he did to all his
[1:34:20] children he will keep every one of his
[1:34:26] promises
[1:34:32] Hallelujah 1 John 3:7 says little
[1:34:36] children I'm going read out of the
[1:34:38] Amplified Believers dear ones don't you
[1:34:42] love how he addresses you Believers dear
[1:34:45] ones do not let anyone Lead You astray
[1:34:49] the one who practices righteousness the
[1:34:51] one who strives to live a constantly
[1:34:53] honorable life in private as well as in
[1:34:55] public and to conform to God's precepts
[1:34:58] is righteous just as he is righteous the
[1:35:01] one who practices sin separating himself
[1:35:04] from God offending him by acts of
[1:35:06] Disobedience indifference or Rebellion
[1:35:08] is of the devil and takes his inner
[1:35:11] character and moral values from him and
[1:35:13] not from God for the devil has sinned
[1:35:16] and violated God's law from the
[1:35:18] beginning the Son of God appeared for
[1:35:21] this
[1:35:21] purpose to destroy the works of the
[1:35:27] devil Hallelujah not one who's born of
[1:35:30] God deliberately know and habitually
[1:35:32] practices sin because God see his
[1:35:35] principle of Life the essence of his
[1:35:37] righteous character remains permanently
[1:35:39] in him who is born again who is reborn
[1:35:42] from above spiritually transformed
[1:35:44] renewed and set apart for his purpose
[1:35:47] and he who is Born Again cannot
[1:35:49] habitually live a life car characterized
