something prepared for you today amen to receive from him and amen you know i think too many times you know we allow the outside world and things affect our our emotions and our attitude and things when we come to church i believe we walk through these doors we ought to let the outside stay on the outside because god is here to meet us and i don't want to miss him how many can say lord don't don't let me miss you tonight don't let me miss you as you would come and speak to us today amen we have many needs to bring before you this evening amen but there's not one here that's impossible there's not one disease here that's incurable there's not one situation here that god's not able to handle what an awesome god you can't get no better than the god that we serve a man of god who answers a god who understands a god who meets our needs we have sister sharon baxter she's feeling a lot better but just haven't yet they had to put a stint in her kidney from that big stone that is there and they're trying to see in the next few weeks how much your kidney is still working amen i know a god who restores kidneys amen the devil can put a blockage there but god can renew it all over again amen we're just going to believe for complete delivery we have brother james sister ruth wilson that's homesick sister naomi wilson that's homesick that has actually tested positive for the coven and so we want to remember them today i know the world and the devil wants to put it on you that you're something that that's not worth you're not a worthy person if you get the kobe but the cope is nothing different than any other cold or sickening it's a devil and it's a tormenting spirit amen and so we're just going to call him out on the streets tonight and shoot him amen and so uh we just believe the lord has got a blood for that and his healing virtues has paid the price for that so we have that need and so we're going to ask the lord to move on their behalf brother kenny camp recovering still in pain and things asking the lord to move for him for the alvin adams had to be taken to the hospital i believe it was just a couple of days ago yesterday or the day before having seizures and they're trying to figure out what is going on with him doing tests on him and so he'd been put on a ventilator but has been taken off and doing something better but we just asked the lord to move for him as well brother donny reagan also suffering with a covet that's going through their church quite rapidly but ben davis has had it in the past been over it for almost a month but still suffering from the side effects of it asking for prayer sister erica reagan having dealing with her situation and with cancer and things and then this covet outbreak is causing even more problems but we're just asking god to move for her today amen also we want to pray for sister nancy herron's cousin wayne wood he set a fourth colon surgery in the icu and started dialysis today really needs some touch from the lord also there's a brother eugene kennedy [Music] he's just a man a brother there and brother in happy valley that the devil's put something on the doctors have not been able to determine what it is but he has shriveled up to about a 80 90 pound man and just really been suffering for many years from whatever this is but the lord is here to touch him and to meet him today and so we just believe for his healing amen how many of you would believe with these how many would have a need you know to make it known to the lord and ask brother tim to come and and he's got a few things to say today and but to take these needs before the lord amen praise the lord we need to take these prayer requests to our hearts tonight and maybe you just can't remember them all but maybe

believing that god's going to meet you where you are so father we bow before your throne of grace tonight we want to say lord that we love you and what a great anticipation we have lord just hearing the report of brother ron how it stirs the excitement lord that all things are possible if we can believe tonight and lord i believe that we're a people who have been trained through the ministry of this message lord for the past 40 plus years to not look at the scientific realm to not look at the machines and or the circumstances that surround us but lord we've been trained to focus on the promise of god you've laid it in your word you declared you are a healer you declared you're a provider you declared you're a miracle worker and lord we're the people here tonight manifesting in the end time to take you at your word and to believe that promise father and lord we're just thankful to be here tonight and we asked dear god tonight that you would open up the windows of heaven and begin to pour out a blessing upon your people lord not that me as a man would have anything to say but father i yield my vessel i yield my voice i yield my mind my body as to instrument tonight of righteousness and asking that you just moved tonight lord may you anoint the ears of the here that they can move past lord what they face today or throughout the week or the fear covet or the fear of cancer or the fear whatever the unknown may be father but may we rise up into the realm of faith tonight and believe for the impossible god i'm here tonight as your representative and i trust tonight we come with an expectation to hear from god lord we have heard how marvelous you were in the old testament lord we've seen you move in the new testament we heard how powerful and magnificent you were in the 50s and 60s but lord tonight we want to see a living god we're asking tonight god you manifest yourself in our midst tonight lord make the mysteries known to us lord make the healings and the deliverances made manifest tonight lord there's people with needs in their bodies as they were read across this sacred desk may you come tonight god through the manifestation of your word and break the yoke of the enemy tonight break the back of the devil tonight god and give your people the deliverers that they long for we ask it tonight because we believe lord and believers believe and when we ask then we believe that all heaven is behind that prayer so lord come tonight manifest yourself for we ask it in jesus name amen if you have your bibles tonight i'm going to have you turn to luke verse 1 or luke chapter 1 and verse 26. you believe the same power is here tonight you believe the same word that speaks to mountain is here tonight the same presence is here tonight the same god of the old is the same god that's here tonight that's not a cliche that's not something that we look back on that's something that we believe each and every day every morning you wake up you got to believe that the god of the old testament is the god of the new and he's the god of the now oh it's not so much just being a god of history we don't need a god of history we need a present tense god and i'm here to talk to you tonight about a god that is here a god that is doing the miraculous in our midst i want to speak to you tonight on god does impossible math part two but i want to bring it down god wants you to believe for the impossible last time we spoke we talked about how great god is and how god does the miraculous and how he they'll just be able to just move in our midst and he does so many things and many times we take our human element and we take ourselves out of the equation but god wants you to believe that you can do the impossible and he wants you to believe for the impossible so i ask you tonight how many you gotta need tonight and it seems impossible you're facing a mountain tonight and it seems like you can't get over you can't get around it you can't get through it but i'm here to tell you tonight about a god that says you can not only did he says you can he says you already have done it because we've already been seen in a vision hey man i feel like preaching tonight so i hope you're with me we find here in luke 1 and chapter luke 1 verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god into a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came unto her and he said hell thou art highly favored and the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou has found favor with god oh i'll tell you i'm here talking about another virgin in the end time that's found favor with god oh and he stepped out of the regions of the the most high and he stepped out of glory and he's come down in this tower and he said hell little bride thou art highly favored he's not looking through the hedges and highways to find that mistress or to find that one he's found or right here in the end time he believing people that stood by and listened to the word of god come forth oh i love this and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and and his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall these things be seeing that i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also the holy thing we shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived in her old age and this is a six month with her who was called barren verse 37 for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her you can have your seats tonight i have a list of some names of some needs but not only did i make this list just to put it on paper but i made it because i believe god's going to move into miraculous some of you here tonight are on this list some of you out there in the stream atlanta are on this list tonight but i'm believing that god's going to do something we've come way too far to ex to not expect anything from god we find here that this word impossible means unable to be or unable to exist unable to be true and you know what the devil's propaganda is to get that in your mind you can't overcome you can't do this you can't do that you've got to stay sick there's no healing virtue in the word there's no healing for you it's for somebody else and he's come and he's come time and time again and he's riddled your mind with propaganda and he's riddled your mind with doubts and he's riddled your mind with lies and he's got you into a prison of fear he's got you into a prison of doubt he's got you in a prison of unbelief and you can't break out but i'm here to tell you tonight house of hell you got to give way to the name of jesus because at the name of jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess every demon has to fall before the almighty god and we're gonna tell you tonight about a living god and he's expecting a people tonight to believe for the impossible the devil says it's impossible for you to get out the devil says it's impossible you to be healed but god said i've already healed you by my strength you are healed you know that's how the jews got sent to concentration camps because the propaganda of the nazi army propaganda their propaganda turned to countries in which the jews were living in against them their friends were turned against them the government officials were turned against them and i'm here to tell you satan's doing everything he can to turn this world against you and he's succeeding but i want you to know that's not the end of the story oh no god has got some allies god has got some sons of god out there and he's got some sons of gods out there all through the world and what are they doing they got a mission we got to free those that are oppressed we got to break through there and let them know there's a land beyond the river there's a god that heals there's a god that saves there's a god that sets free there's a god that does the impossible i just believe it tonight i love how the prophet would take us back into time as we look at this story of mary because you may think well well this is an unlikely text to preach on god wants you to believe for the impossible what we find here brother brown was saying a spring sun was rising in the judean skies his little mary started down the road with her water pot underneath her arm going to get her water and you know what she was in her youthful mind just thinking about the day before and you know the day before she went to church went to the synagogue her and joseph and they listened to him a great sermon there by the rabbi and the rabbi was talking to him about you know how god had moved upon abraham's heart and said abraham i'm going to take you to a land and i'm going to multiply you and your seeds are gonna be like the sands of the of the seashore and they're gonna be innumerable and they just talked about how great god was and how marvelous god was and how when daniel was stoned into the lions then he shut the mouths of the lions how in the hebrew children were thrown into a fiery furnace he came down as a fourth man and he talked about how shamgar with the little ox gold had a bravery he was anointed to take out 600 philistines and how samson picked up a jawbone of an ass and whooped a thousand for listings and he just kept going on about how great this god is talked about how in a valley was a bunch of dry bones and life but came to these dry bones and they rose up a living army son of man can these bones live oh yeah oh they can live they just was exhorting the people and encouraging the people but the prophet god will say but at the end of his message he ruined it he ruined what he was talking about when he said those great days of jehovah dealing with the people like that wasn't necessary no more notice what the the rabbi they had become settled down in their homeland they didn't exactly need miracles no more oh what about the preaching that's going around this message today we don't need the holy ghost no more we don't need to speaking in tongues we don't need all that it's all emotion i'm here to tell you may the people of god may the sons and daughters of god never settle for an emotionless religion oh they want to say it's gone they want to say it's days going by you let them say that we still need miracles we still need god we still need a healer we still need to deliver we still need to see the impossible made real brother the man will say they had good doctors for their sickness which was certainly all right they were better off they had they had their homes and they just didn't need god or miracles anymore but somehow that didn't settle somehow that didn't settle and satisfy the thirst and the hunger of joseph and mary and i trust it doesn't satisfy you tonight know mary began to talk to joseph she knows you know how we are honey sugar booger some of y'all don't have those pet names for your spouse yeah you do you just try to hold a poker face tonight mary was just asking joseph this great god that brought us here and made us what we are he doesn't have to do those things for us now like he did then she's contemplating thinking about the message before i've been thinking for a long time that if god was as great in the days of our fathers as he was in the days of our grandfathers then why isn't he the same great god today if he was so great on the shores of galilee and he was so great in the 50s and 60s and we seen blind eyes open and we seen the sick healed and we've seen the dead race why isn't he the same god today why isn't he the same god and even like tabernacle why isn't he the same god across the world today brother branham would say and further on in different messages he would say that the people has allowed the enemy to explain away the value of the word i don't think that'll ever be the case at this church you've got men of god who's been anointed to proclaim the living god no matter how we feel no matter how what we face in life no matter the difficulty and adversity we face we believe in a living god and no doubt mary and joseph would begin to read in the scrolls and they picked up the bible or picked up their scroll and they read isaiah 9 6 and the scripture would say unto us a child is born and and to us a son has given it and mary would just begin to think joseph if god is not the same today as he was yesterday and if he's not as good as he was today as he was for our fathers and forefathers can we ever believe that isaiah 96 is ever going to come to pass will god ever send us a child will god ever send us a son and she began to meditate on it and she was going to get her water and let me tell you the problem god said when you begin to think about god he shows up oh i hope you came to church tonight with your minds on jesus hope you didn't come with your mind on copa 19 and your mind on cancer and your mind on the stresses of this life but i hope you come tonight with your mind stayed on him but i'm here to tell you if you did he's here to meet you tonight he's here to come by your way tonight and administer what you have need of oh she began to walk and all of a sudden she seen a little flicker of light and she just pondered thinking about a 16 17 year old girl thinking about the scriptures and thinking about the message from the day before does he still do that and now all of a sudden probably god say out from a pillar of fire stepped the angel gabriel hail mary i'm sent from the presence of the lord to tell you that you're highly favored oh come on little bride we had a messenger coming this day hell mary thou art highly favored among all the churches in the land they are highly favored out of all the ones that he could have chosen he's chosen you here tonight chosen you because he knew that you had a desire for the things of god and the prophet of god will say look she she saw the great angel and it startled the little virgin and she stopped and she came close or he came close to her and she saluted and he saluted excuse me and he gave her a message that was a hard message for that child to believe for she wasn't nothing but a girl he gave her something to believe that was more outstanding and hard to believe than anything that he has ever given to anyone but he gave it to a little virgin and i'm gonna take he's given us a message it may seem hard for you to believe or hard for the world to believe but mary said be it unto me according to your word and i'm trusting that this mary in this last day that anointed lady that elected bride she's saying being unto me lord hey saying that the days of miracles has passed but i say being unto me today lord i need a touch i need a healing i need a deliverance i need a change in my body i need a rapture of this vessel oh be it unto me tonight father when i walk out of here i don't walk out decrepit i'm not gonna walk out here feeble man i'm gonna walk out here as a son of god as a daughter of god victorious because why because i met the angel of the lord [Music] and he's come by my way and when i can't believe the rabbi i'm going to believe the angel oh when you can't believe the denominations oh and you can't believe some of the message churches out there we're going to believe the angel we're going to stay with the word oh hallelujah notice he said she had to believe for something that had never happened a woman having a baby without knowing any man and she said how shall these things be and he simply repeated or simply stated to her the holy ghost shall oversaddle thee and the holy thing that shall be born in thee shall be called a son of god it linked her to isaiah 9 6. the scripture she was pondering when how if god is not as great as he was yesterday then how is isaiah 9 6 gonna be made manifest but notice mary took him at his word and he changed her whole course of her natural life oh i remember one time when i took god in his word oh i was going the wrong way but the angel of the lord i always said the angel lord i heard a voice tell me turn your car around and go back home now i could have been disobedient and kept on going and i would have kept on going down that same old sinful road that i was headed in but no i obey the voice of the lord and what did he do he changed oh hallelujah he changed my entire natural course of my life i'm no longer a sinner i'm no longer in drugs i'm no longer in smoking and drinking and partying and drunk and all that and women no sir i'm on fire for the lord and i'm here to tell you tonight that same holy ghost that same god that same power that same fire he's here tonight to anoint some of you young people you may be going the wrong way but all you got to do is listen to the voice all you got to do tonight is obey the voice he said turn around i turned around and i believe what he said and he changed my entire life oh i'm not the same person i used to be and the prophet of god said he will change the course of your life tonight if you'll take them at his word if you're a sinner he'll straighten that crooked life of yours out if you're a vile and a moral he'll make you pure as a lily if you'll just take him at his word if you have cancer tonight he will change that for you and give you help brother ron says to erica all these different ones that are facing cancer if you can believe tonight take god at his word he will completely rewrite your life you don't have to go to a grave by cancer no the god that we serve is greater and mightier he said he'll change that for you and give you health if you have tuberculosis or sickness of some kind that your doctors cannot help he will change that for you if you'll just take him at his word and this is his word i am the lord thy god that heals all thy diseases sometimes when we read the bible we get calloused we just read it like we're reading the newspaper oh no but when you see that that promise laying in the word you see that we're a sinner you don't have to be a sinner anymore but you can be a saint of god you that's been cancer stricken and sickness stricken when you see that i'm the lord thy god that heals all those diseases you can stand up right then and claim that promise for yourself and walk out victorious oh if you can just believe him if you can believe for your healing tonight you'll walk out different you can believe him tonight for deliverance he'll walk out not bound by oppression not bound by depression not bound by some spirit of fear trying to hover over you saying it's going to come back you know that's how these little arms i got excuse me that's how the enemy wants to fight you though god brings a great deliverance and the first thing the devil does is begin to remind you of the power and the control that he once had on you maybe you were stricken with cancer and god came down in a miraculous way and defeated that cancer i want you know that's a finality when god stepped in but the devil's there trying to get his bluff back in he's coming with propaganda and he's coming with his life but i'm here to tell you tonight our god is able he's done it one time he'll keep it from you all you got to do is believe in the impossible god is greater than your sickness god is greater than your temptations god is greater than your trial god is greater than your situation god is greater than your family genetic god is greater and he's wanting you to believe tonight oh if you take him at his word tonight you'll see the miraculous notice now as soon as the angel the lord told her that her cousin and she about her cousin she accepted the will of the lord to be done brother brahma says the only thing she knowed would happen that the holy spirit was going to do it he goes now how can cancer be cured when the doctors give it up he said it's not me to try to figure it out see that's our problem we go to google.com and you go to typing in your symptoms and you go to typing in this and you go to typing in that when you start going to google.com and you start those first keystrokes all you've done is doubted the power of god instead of going to google won't you come to the bible when he says by my stripes every promise you have need of lays in this word tonight you don't need to go to google you don't need to go to chrome you don't need to go to some other website all you got to do is come to jesus oh the doctors may say well you got this and you got that we can appeal our case tonight to the great physician we can fill our case tonight through the one that has control over this body the one that has control over our future the one has control over our eternal destination we can appeal to him tonight well how can cancer be cured when a doctor has given up he said it's not for me to try to figure it out is take god at his word of the holy spirit he was the one who made the promise and he's the one who confirms that promise and he's obligated to keep the promise do you believe tonight notice now mary didn't wait till she felt positive mary didn't wait till she got in the first end of the first trimester and she got that little bump most disgusting pictures i ever put on facebook just thought i'd say that but anyway she didn't wait till she got the bump and she didn't run to eckharts she didn't run the cvs she didn't run to walmart and pick up a little test and say oh joseph this is what the angel the lord told me i need to make sure of this i need to verify this note she took god at his word when it was scientifically unproven it was impossible but the angel said mary that thing that's going to overshadow you it's the holy ghost and that thing which is going to be born of you it's gonna be the son of god and she looked back to isaiah nine and six and said say be it unto me tonight god according to your word she didn't feel it she didn't see it she did all she did was believe what he said and if you can take god at his word tonight oh if you can take god at his word tonight and begin to doubt your doubts begin to push away your fears begin to push away through your sickness and begin to take god at his word tonight you're going to see god moving to miraculous notice now brother brown will say take god at his word believe it anyhow no matter how impossible it looks to be believe god and he will bring it to pass do you believe that tonight mark 9 and verse 23 mark 9 and verse 23 jesus is telling you tonight if thou can't believe then all things are possible to him that believeth if thou canst believe so he's taking it away from him because we know he can do the impossible but now he's placing it upon you if you can believe tonight you that are expecting a child you need to desire a child you just got a wayward loved one out there if you can believe tonight you that are sick and body you that are sick in mind you that are out there dealing with issues in this life if you can't believe tonight all things are possible oh didn't the angel lord tell the prophet of god he says if you can get the people to believe if you can get the people to believe you oh nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer let me tell you that wasn't just for a prophet that was a word for a dispensation he was telling it to a people if you can get those people down there and lay on the seal to believe my word and to believe that i'm the same yesterday today and forever not even cancer will stand before you not even tuberculosis not even october 19 not even away with loved ones not even sugar diabetes not even parkinson's disease nothing will stand before you if you can get them to believe oh if i could get you to believe that tonight you don't have to be bound any longer possessing the gaze of his enemy brother brahma said god is true to his promise no matter what he has to do bankrupt the heavens before he would ever let the word go defeated oh church you can hang your soul on every divine promise of god tonight i don't care how small that word is you can hang it on there because god ain't gonna let it be defeated notice now he never made a promise that he can't keep i'm the lord that heals all thy diseases if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover if thou cast believe all things are possible and joshua believed it now let's go back into that era for a minute joshua was fighting a battle and he had his enemy on the run and some of you got your enemies on the run tonight but you're running out of daylight it's getting dark they didn't have lights like we have tonight they didn't have street lights where they can keep on fighting and radar and all these different things no joshua needed a little bit of sunlight he didn't go and beg god he didn't go and have a prayer meeting he said son you stand still and you believe the word of god he believed that he was anointed to take the people into the promised land and so he spoke the word and god said that he hung the sun up there and the moon there and the problem of god said it didn't turn for 24 hours it was an impossibility but he did it and your situation tonight may be an impossibility but you can do it but your son and your moon needs to hear your voice i said your son and your moon needs to hear your voice so you can whip your enemy until he's finally completely defeated notice now joshua avenged himself upon his enemy and he took the gates of his enemy and and the word tells us tonight if we can believe this evening that we can take the gates of any enemy that we face no matter what we're facing tonight maybe you've got threats of the enemy coming in your mind tonight telling you you're going to lose your healing you're going to lose your deliverance i'm going to tell you tonight you can take the gate of that enemy tonight maybe he's come with threats maybe he's come with your situation but if you can believe tonight all things are possible all things are possible you guys want to know what makes the devil mad one of y'all so i'm gonna preach to you andrew the rest of them don't care you want to know what makes the devil mad the prophet of god says when the people of god begin to believe who they are oh when you can see in the word that you're not some little cast down you're not some little put away no but you are sons and daughters of god when you believe who you are and who you are then there ain't no devil can stand before you listen what the prophet god will say here he says now that's what makes the devil mad that's what shakes him when the church of jesus christ only know who they were brother he says oh my he said there's nothing impossible with god but god said there's nothing impossible with you tonight he said that changes the subject don't it there's nothing impossible with you see so whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive it and you shall have it he says now if we become in the spirit sons of god he says then deity dwells in the man do you realize what deity is it's christ himself deity creative power devil defeating power cancer stomping power brain bleed buffering kicking and screaming power tonight we got power over every curse of the enemy because why because we're not just some little nobody in laodicea no but sons and daughters of god and deity jesus christ himself the creator of power that spoke the worlds into existence is inside this room tonight inside your vessel and your vessel so whatever you speak tonight is the same as almighty god speaking he goes you talk about blind eyes being open they said nothing impossible to god god said nothing impossible with you if you'll believe not with god but you deities in man the very god that stood back on the mythical platform of the eternities and he rode off his hands and created these things he give you the privilege to be his sons and you're part of him and god dwells in mankind and man himself is deity let's go a little bit further with that in the same power that same christ let the fundamentalists let the people who deny the power of god they say that it's wrong but the same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the holy ghost he says men and women it's time that we found out who you are the devil's trying to hide you back that was trying to tell you your little some coward down something you're not you're sons and daughters of god deities not in heaven it's in you tonight can you believe that tonight if you can truly believe that tonight then nothing is impossible with you i said nothing is impos well brother joe you don't know how bad they've gone you don't have foreign to tell you tonight that the hand of god is not shortened and it's not slack that he can't reach down he can go further down then your head can reach up i'm gonna tell you don't you give up tonight god is able if you'll stay the court and believe the word that day and their offspring shall be there with them don't you back up because you see something don't you back up because you you look at the circumstances we look beyond the circumstances and we look back to the word of god because deity is inside of you tonight said he stood back there the crater of all things he made little frogs and bees and ducks and chickens and animals created everything and nothing was made but was made by him who christ a deity he brought down the plagues and everything in the days of egypt who christ he stopped the mouths of lions he crushed the violence of fire and they escaped at the edge of the sword they raised the dead from the grave who christ oh he goes what is it who is he he's christ the deity and brother and sister he said that deity is in you tonight oh i hope i can get you to believe i'll tell you i hope i can get you to believe that tonight deity you look in the mirror and you see all man you wake up in the morning your hair is all nappy and red and you think how can i ever be it ain't looking in the mirror church it's looking into the mirror of the word and it's saying lord i believe i don't feel like it i don't sometimes act like it but that don't matter i believe what your word says about me i believe tonight that deity is inside of me and i got cancer crushing power i got devil defeating power i got the word restoring power tonight it's in me because i recognize i'm a son and i'm a daughter of god and god wants you to believe tonight for the impossible when he spoke creation he believed his own word and when you begin to speak you've got to believe your own word he says now if you abide in me and my word in you then you have god the word is in you and you believe the word just as you believe because it's god and it's inseparable notice now then if you have god's word in you you have god's life in you you have god in you and whatsoever god god's word speaks forth out of you it'll have to come to pass just like it spoke from god so sister karen don't you fear anymore because he's already performed a miracle he ain't going back on his word that devil of fear has got to leave oh yeah satan comes he wants to crowd around and hover around and tell you you ain't gonna ever get saved brother ram said a little black cloud hung over him when he was a young boy kept him from receiving uh giving his life to the lord at a young age oh but there's a there's been a pillar of fire coming this hour there's been a pillar of fire revealed in this hour oh jesus said whatever you ask the father in my name that will i do that's a promise church it's a promise for you tonight all you got to do is claim that promise whatever you ask the father that i'll do did you realize what that means do you realize if we go before god in the name of jesus it's just the same as jesus himself praying i can't recall one time in the bible that jesus's prayer was ever unfulfilled but every time he prayed every time he went to the throne of god god responded and god met his need it's the same way with you as sons and daughters of god when you earnestly but go before god and you've been compelled and you're not just come haphazardly but you've got a burden on your heart and you go before god you watch god move oh i tell you gotta come down in a moment in a minute in a time when you least expect it and break the shackles off somebody's life and break the curse of sin of somebody's life and break the curse of the enemy or whatever kind of affliction over their life and raise them up to a new man then he says now i've got to receive what i asked for because he said it and it's god's own word it can't and he said it can't do nothing else but produce just what it said now how many of you said you got a need tonight if you can speak to that need tonight oh i'm here to tell you you're going to see god moving this surface tonight well brother joe we just don't feel it it ain't based on how you feel no let's create an atmosphere starting right now an atmosphere of faith an atmospheric belief an atmosphere that we can do the impossible we're not going to listen to any more lies you push the lies out tell the enemy right now that you ain't listening to him anymore he can take his propaganda and he can go to hell with it because we're going to tune into the word tonight and the word says let this mind be in you which was also in christ what did that mind do that mind didn't think it was robbery to be equal with god let me tell you if that was the mind that he had that's the mind that we're to have then we've got to believe tonight that we can be co-equal with god and whatsoever things we pray whatsoever things we desire when we go before the throne of grace god will meet that need and what does the mind of christ do it looks to the unseen he looks to the miraculous it calls those things that were not as though they are oh he says when we become born of the spirit of god he becomes an offspring our son of god and then he has the same type of mind that god does and that mind that was in christ is in you and we believe for the unseen for the miraculous come on church are y'all picking up what i'm putting down you're awful quiet tonight i'm trying to get your faith elevated oh we got enough pressure out there in the world when you walk outside these doors hell's right there to bombard you but i'm talking about we're in the presence of a living god tonight where all things are possible obviously the waters are being troubled and let me tell you when that day when the waters would be in trouble those that were standing by waiting for the angel of the lord to come down they looked for the supernatural they came to every service because they knew they could get to the water first they could be healed they could be delivered and if i could get you to look tonight there's the stirring of the waters and the age of the lord is here you can be healed tonight you can be delivered tonight because the power of god is here you heard the brother tim said he felt a hand on his shoulder that ain't a man church the angels here to trouble the waters the angel is here and he's troubling the waters tonight trying to get you to believe oh if you could just look at it and realize it ain't some man it ain't some pepped up little story it ain't some little feel good preaching but it's the word of god coming to you telling you tonight you can believe for the impossible he said they would rush they would rush into the water oh my mary didn't wait till she felt positive now she saw the stirring and she ran to meet it be it unto me tonight lord last time i preached this or part one of this mess i had a brother write me he said brother joe i just had to write you to give you my testimony after watching your message in possible math notice mary didn't wait till she was showing she didn't wait till she felt the first kick she didn't wait till she was vomiting because she had morning sickness she didn't wait for any of those things she went confessing and praising god immediately after she left the angel and this brother wrote me he says look he says i just had to write you to give you my testimony after watching your message impossible math i received my healing from parkinson's disease which i had for over three years yes the doctors proclaimed that there was no cure for this disease but look how simple it came when i viewed the complex math problem on the back wall they're behind you he goes i knew or i believed that there was an answer to the problem it was then that i realized in my finite puny mind that just because i didn't have or i didn't understand the answer to the problem that it didn't mean that there is one that didn't exist he said how great is our god that he loves to take the most difficult problems and solve them how that ought to increase our faith he says share this with your congregation because i'm about ready to do a dance and revival is on oh fast out there on the live stream what about in the presence here tonight look you ain't got to wait till you feel it you can stand up right now dawg holy spirit will anoint your faith and say this is it this is the last moment that i'll fight this demon this is the last moment because my god is real and i'm going to believe tonight for the impossible that cancer's got to lead the berkeley's has got to leave every day parker says it's got to leave heart trouble's got to leave high blood pressure's got to leak oh it's got to go tonight i believe tonight i don't have to wait till special meet i don't have to wait to attempt surf i can believe it tonight and god will be dead in me and i'm taking the waters of being troubled and he's here oh church he's here tonight he's here to give you your sons he's here to give you your daughters he's here to give you life he's here to give you children he's here to give you help he's here tonight all things are possible oh i tell you all things are possible in this atmosphere in this presence satan is on the run don't you back off you sat back down but don't you give up that promise uh you stood up and testified this is it autoimmune disease it's over i'm not going to face another minute i'm not living another minute with the frogs i declare the word i declare deliverance i declare victory i declare power over this enemy said if he says i believe if every patient in this building right now would accept it upon those grounds of god's word and believe it and start testifying and start praising god for your healing he said this meeting wouldn't close with one crippled person in here that's right oh if you can accept it tonight not according to brother joe but according to the promise that god makes you and you believe that tonight and you begin to testify whether you feel like it whether you look like whether you act like it don't matter and begin to praise god he says there wouldn't be one crippled person walk out of this meeting tonight there wouldn't be one tonight that stood to their feet walk out defeated without the promise that god gave oh hallelujah notice now this virgin birth was a miracle it was a paradox it was an impossibility to the human mind yes but to the mind of christ absolutely not to the mind of christ it's already been seen in the word some 800 years later oh the prophet of god say we have heard and we have heard great testimonies down through the ages but now we see i said now we are seeing the manifestation of the revealed word of the hour now we're seeing not just a little intellectual understanding of placing this here and placing that there and having this seal open and that seal open and this seal somehow it didn't get open but no it's now we believe all the word has been restored to a people but it ain't just about the word but now in this hour for a people they got the spirit of god because the spirit of god comes and anoints that word because the letter killeth but the spirit is here to give life and we got more than just a word we got the anointing of the holy ghost behind that word the mechanics with the dynamic to get the car into a rapture church i'm here to talk to you about a god of impossibilities making the possibility made real through your life tonight through your flesh tonight through your desires through your children tonight he's the god of the impossible and so are you [Applause] he healed the sick of leprosy when there was no cure and he's here tonight can i go just a few more minutes i'm gonna kick in my teaching gift just kidding brother timothy and i were texting a while back when sister karen first had her episode brother timothy text me let me read the scripture first mark 11 23 if you put that up there for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain that word mountain is a difficulty or let me say it like this an impossibility could you imagine speaking to a mountain and it's going to vanish people will think you're completely insane but it's a difficulty it's an impossibility but whosoever shall say unto this impossibility be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you what things soever ye desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them you believe and you shall see it don't rest on god and rest on you tonight believing in the impossibility and if you can put your fears aside and your doubts aside and channel your faith tonight to believe the word of god every mouth has got to fall brother timothy told me he says we are assigned mountains to show others that they can be moved do you believe that tonight david was signed to goliath to show that he could be defeated shamgar was a size 600 but he picked up a knox go to prove to some others that you can beat if you could defeat your philistines samson picked up a jawbone and deflated of a thousand to show that they could be defeated daniel was indonesian that showed that they could be defeated sister atlanta had stage fours hodgkin's disease but let me tell you she had it so that god could show others that cancer can and will be defeated mariah pruitt had alopecia let's show others that alopecia has to bow before the name of jesus sister karen had brain please but it showed that god gave her a mountain that had to move to prove to others that it has to fall to the word of god and if you can speak to your mountain tonight whatever you are facing tonight it's got to obey your voice it's got to come falling down i'm here to tell you mountains will move tonight goliaths will fall tonight philistines will be defeated and fires will be quenched and lions will be tamed at your voice at your command what is god doing oh we heard these great things shreveport louisiana we've heard these great things jeffersonville indiana we heard about a god yesterday but why did he come by here to prove that he's the same today cancer nothing but a toothache he says now we have to believe the impossibilities to see new life we have to believe the impossibilities to receive new life but when you believe the impossible the doctor says you got cancer you're dying you got to believe the impossibility to see new life take a hold of you if your doctor says you can't you can't walk you've got to believe the impossible to see new life coming to you new life in them fibers oh bring forth a new hand a new arm new lungs new stomach whatever it is god will do it if you'll take them at his word as we start wrapping this up i told y'all the testimony of sister beth dingle she had a cancer that attacks only kids and leukemia no one had ever survived it had a 100 success rate of killing those that got it but the church rallied behind a little daughter of god and believed and a family rallied behind a daughter of god and believed and they had to rewrite the history books because she's one in a million oh church our sister atlanta had stage four non-hosting lymphoma the doctors gave her up there wasn't much they could do besides just give her some chemotherapy brother david was threatened and worried what is he gonna do if he loses his wife and he's got five kids think about the five kids in their mind what are we gonna do we're gonna lose our mom because you know we don't know if she's gonna make it or not stage four but the church rallied behind a daughter of god and a family in this church joba one day sitting back there at the end of a service faith dropped down and the impossibility was made real and she took god at his word and did a run around this church and ain't never been the same since because when you believe the impossible you can get new life she's had three or four scans pet scans since that time and she's completely cancer-free why are you saying this brother joe because i'm telling you that he's the same god tonight you may not have cancer you may have something else but he's still god and if i can get you to believe tonight then nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer think about brother ron tonight we heard a great testimony of brother ron here he was a man who was only given four months to live and every 12 weeks he goes back for tests and every 12 weeks he gets stronger and stronger and stronger when the lord said brother ron do you trust me with your life he said yes let me tell you church if you can trust god tonight with your life i'm gonna take he may take you through a hard road but you're gonna come out you're gonna know god in a way you've never known him before you'll never doubt you'll never have unbelief you'll trust god and if i can get you to trust him tonight with your life every day you'll see the miraculous you'll see the supernatural you'll see the manifestation of a living god and that's what we're seeing in virginia is the manifestation of a living god when the son of god said yes lord be it unto me i'll trust you with my life when the doctors gave up on them oh the church rallied behind and believed in the impossible we know the story different ones i want to talk about sister karen just for a minute because it was right after i preach god does impossible math if i'm not mistaken somebody told me that when the service was over sister karen told brother jim he preached it for you tonight not knowing what was he was about to go through and what the family was going to go through god was preparing the church no matter how bleak the situation no matter when they give up he's not done oh did you hear what i said he's not done and he's not done tonight he's not done tonight sister esther sister candace he's not done don't listen to the propaganda so we know the next night i think it was thursday brother tim says sister karen i went to the restroom and started having a headache so he took her to the er and with coleman 19 he couldn't get in there so brother timothy called me it's about 12 30 1 o'clock i went up to the to the er went in and actually was able to go in and of course i worked there so it's not a problem went in and had prayer with her and prayed for and just believed i said god we're going to believe for the impossibilities because you do the impossible math when our human minds can't figure it out when our human minds want to give up god you still have the answer so i asked the doctor i said doc do you mind if i look at the scans i want to see the ct scans he said sure so he brought me over to the machine and i started looking at him and he began to flip through and flip through he says look this is the this is her brain here and this is where it was the last time in april and the time before four or five years ago and you know it's in a completely different spot and in her entire brain cavity on the right side if i'm not mistaken was full of blood and he said there's a little place up here that's kind of an empty place but he says it's supposed to be empty but it's so much brain in there or so much blood in there that it's pushing the brain matter over and it's no longer empty it's full and it's causing her this situation and i said well dog let me ask you this she's had two of these before how severe how serious is this he said he looked at me he says well joe he said let me tell you she could live another five minutes or she could live another five years he said but she will not have a quality of life and without missing a beat i said we're going to believe for the impossible then something just flew right out of me i said we're going to believe for the impossible then and i watched him as they took her into an ambulance and took her to lsu i didn't have one fear because i knew the god that we served and so the next day they did emergency brain surgery and they drained the blood out of her brain and just i think it was several hours later she began to respond to brother tim and then the next day her eyes began to begin open and the next day this and the next day that and it just snowballed and snowballed and snowballed until now she's in the house of god and last week she came up here running up on the platform that shows to you church why is god doing these things that show the world that mountains have to fall a devil has to succumb to the word of god if you can't believe tonight all things are possible i said all things are possible oh if you can believe tonight we believe tonight and thank god in his word every day you can have your healing you can have your children you can have whatever you have needed because he's here the angel of the lord is here and he has stirred the waters he's here tonight stirring the waters would there be somebody that will comes out stepping in tonight brother i'm stepping in tonight today is my day tonight is my night [Applause] why is god doing these things he's proven to those unbelievers out there that say the days of miracles has passed that he's still god he still does the miraculous he still heals there's no heart that he can't rescue there's no war that he can't win there's no story no life too far gone that it can't start again he's still god oh brother i will say as soon as you hear the word of god that says you can be set free believe it rejoice with it god will show the evidence after you've accepted it but first you've got to accept can we accept the word tonight can you accept it for your loved one can you accept it for yourself come on musicians come on musicians let's have church he says you gotta first believe then you gotta accept it then you gotta confess it and then you gotta go praising god for it oh it's time to start praising god for the impossibility it's time we start praising god like sister atlanta did and ran around the building and never had another bout with cancer it's time we start praising god tonight and believe for the impossible and trust god with our life with our young people with our families with our health with whatever we're facing in this life with cobra 19 there ain't no devil strong enough there's no demon power strong enough to defy sons and daughters of god if you're anointed with the holy spirit and you're confessing the word of god notice god brought his special people out of egypt with what may be an insane old man with a stick in his hand where are you going crazy i'm going to easily brother johnny you want to go cause i got a message for pharaoh oh i hope somebody's got a message for your pharaoh tonight oh come on church moses went down there oh he remembers 40 years the devil tried to remind him oh 40 years ago moses you tried this and all you did was killed an addiction he said that was 40 years ago i'm a changed man i'm not the same moses i've been on the back side of a desert i just got anointed with the holy ghost i didn't get on fire for god every day i'm going down because i heard the voice of god say go down moses go down and let my people go you go tell pharaoh he's going to let him go tonight i'm here to tell you church satan you got to let them go tonight they don't belong to you they're children of god they're sons of god they're daughters of god house of hell hear me tonight you let him go in the name of jesus christ moses walked up to pharaoh that was a miracle that was an impossibility he should have been shocked said pharaoh you let him go i got a word from the lord for you you better let him go you can only go so far oh someone some of them out there okay with us so far religion but not the elect we ain't going so far satan says you know what we're going to keep some of your young people no sir we're taking them all we built this church for all of them we built this church for prodigals we built this church because we knew that when it was time to leave we ain't leaving a hoof behind we ain't leaving a young person behind we're not leaving a spouse behind we're not leaving anything behind we're taking everything and we're going to rob our enemy and we're going to take all their silver all their gold all their possessions and we walk it out victorious oh let them go pharaoh you get your stinking livestock you get your stinking little kids you get your youth you get whatever you got to get and you get out of my kingdom oh yeah that's what it's going to tell us and so moses and the children of israel left egypt excited camp meeting atmosphere we're going out glory sing those old songs design i'm one of them hallelujah i'll be glad i ain't got the gift to sing cause i tear it up right now [Music] oh they went out singing rejoicing testifying believing because it was an impossibility pharaoh said i'll never let them go but god came down and when god comes down on your behalf ain't no devil can hold you ain't no devil can hold your young person can't no devil hold your body okay no devil hold your spout can't no devil hold you keep you bound so they started out oh moses you need to check your gps where in the world did you bring us

big boy you don't brought us down here you know what moses did he appealed to the lord he took his case to the lord because he knew the lord spoke to him about leaving and the lord said moses tell the people tonight to stand still and see the salvation of the lord tell them to stand still tell me just give me a few more minutes tonight i'm not done with this service just yet i got a few more things i like to say before it's over moses tell them to stand still because the enemies that they see all those task measures that they've seen today the ones that afflicted them yesterday and came down on them and bombarded their minds with unbelief and doubt and depression and fear and anxieties and worthless life those enemies that they once saw they'll never see them again no more forever moses okay god then what must i do he says all right moses this is gonna seem really strange and it's gonna look like an impossibility to all the people but i want you to take that staff in your hand and i want
