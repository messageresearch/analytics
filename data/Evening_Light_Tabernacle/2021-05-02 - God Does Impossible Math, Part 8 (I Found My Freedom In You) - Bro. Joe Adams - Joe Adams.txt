tonight or this morning rather my lonely is he's god but he's your god he's not just somebody else's story of what god should be but he's god personally to you this morning let's just go to him in prayer father how we thank you lord no matter what the situation is no matter what the circumstances no matter lord where we are if we go into the depths of hell the bible would say you are there if we go into the heavens you are there no matter where we are god you are there and lord we believe this morning that you are right here with us to give strength support comfort lord a word of encouragement to the believer during their time of struggle and strife we asked almighty god that you just make yourself visible among us and we thank you lord that you're present and that your presence is here already father and lord it's nothing that we had done on our own human merit our human ability but it's because you're god and i'm so thankful lord i can look back over the course of my life lord many of the decisions that i had made many mistakes and heartaches but yet father through it all you saw before the foundation of the world that my name would be written in the book and god not only my name but the believers that are sitting here this morning their name were pinned there as well father you're coming today father just to manifest that word to strike a word across that that name lord to bring forth life and we just committed to you this morning father and we say we love you lord and we're so thankful and we just give this service to you lord father you see what i'm fighting back in my emotions this morning i'm asking for your strength now father i pray lord you'll anoint your servant lord just to step aside this morning and allow the spirit of christ to move and the minister and i also pray that you'll anoint the ears of the hearer lord that we can both hear and receive lord from the word today for we ask it in jesus name amen and amen just want to first say before we get into the word this morning if you give me a little bit more volume up here brother tim that would be great thanks for all the prayers all the texts to myself to our family during this time many of you probably didn't know but my brother-in-law nathan was killed in a car accident on thursday night tragic accident so we're having to deal with that this week and i've been at home alone as a family's up in virginia and trying to fight back the emotions and things of that nature and yet preparing to be able to speak to you this morning but you know it's great to know that you're loved and supported by a family a church family and not only our local family but there's texts and there's messages coming in throughout all around the world that know that we're related and it's just so nice to be loved and we appreciate your love we appreciate your support we appreciate your prayers but i would ask that if you do me a favor keep my mother law in your sincere deepest prayer she's hurting right now and rightly so she's lost her only son she lost her husband a few years ago or dad a couple months before that but i told her this morning i said i'll be the son that you never had said i'm gonna love you the way you wanted to be loved by your son and i mean that from the bottom of my heart and i believe that we can't take these moments that we've been given frivolous we got to cherish every moment every opportunity so today i may come with more what seems like a more evangelistic message and i just trusted something to be said that will speak to you we're going to speak on god does impossible math part 8 but i want to give it a subtitle i found my freedom in you if you're not here today or if you're here today and you haven't found that freedom yet i want you to know there's freedom in christ there's victory in christ you don't have to stay bound you don't have to live under your god-given privileges not when there's been a price that's been paid so we're going to look here in psalms 119 and verse 57 as we start this morning says thou art my portion o lord i have said that i would keep thy words i am treated thy favor with my whole heart be merciful unto me according to thy word i thought on my ways and i turned my feet unto thy testimonies i made haste and delayed not to keep thy commandments if also we're going to look here in james 4 and verse 14. james 4 and verse 14. whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow we don't know what tomorrow holds but if you're a believer this morning you know who holds your tomorrow and if you're not a believer this morning you have no hope but i want to introduce you this morning to a hope to more than a hope of faith that you can be anchored in him it says for what is your life it is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away you can be seated this morning so like i said we're going to speak this morning on i found my freedom in you and as i began to study this in lieu of what just took place in our family and the loss of my brother-in-law and i just couldn't help but think life is so precious when moments it's here the next minute it's gone the bible will say it's like a vapor you just breathe it it's a myth when you breathe it out you can never get it back and that's how life is and the prophet god would tell us in the hebrew series he said what difference does it make if i'm 80 there's we have 80 year olds here tonight or this morning if i'm 20 i'm only here for one thing and that's to serve the lord so we're not here to see one another this morning we're not here to to rack up a bunch of dead or a bunch of a nice house and cars and things of that nature but we're here for one thing and that's to serve the lord he said there's many a man 80 years old tonight and there's lots of children will die when i am 80 year old and without live of many of them he says what difference does it make it's your motive and your principles and we're here to serve the lord jesus that's all knowing this that this life is a vapor that a man speaks about that once was and then is not but if we have eternal life god has promised that he would raise us up again so in little of what just took place for my brother-in-law i mean we didn't have much contact with him over the last several months but i want you to know this morning you know we're given an opportunity this sunday you're given an opportunity whether you're young whether you're old whether you're middle age whatever your situation whatever the background in your life in god has given you that opportunity this morning to make sure that you can look on your ways and say you know what i'm going to turn my feet to the testimonies of the lord this morning he says about 21 years he goes one day i had a battle with this and i battled with the other and i couldn't make out whether i wanted to be a fighter whether i want to be a trapper where i wanted to be a hunter what i want to do but he says i met melchizedek and he gave me my commission i wonder if we can meet that same melchizedek coming back from the battle he's already won your victory this morning if we can meet him this morning he said well brother joe you know i got this hanging on me and i got that hanging on me but i'm here to introduce you to the melchizedek i'm here this morning to introduce you to the one that can liberate your change and break you from the bondage that's been holding you back he goes i met melchizedek and he gave me a commission and since then it was settled forever and when it comes to the end of the road and their death stares me in the face the way that i feel now i'll never dread it i'll walk i won't walk in the face of it knowing this that i know him who has made the promise that's right that i know him in the power of his resurrection and that's how we want to know him this morning nathan shaw will never get another opportunity but you're giving one this morning i'm giving one this morning you have that opportunity today to seize your call and to make your calling an election sure see when he calls from the dead i'll come out from among them that's right knowing him in the power of the resurrection what difference does it make whether i'm old whether i'm young whether i'm little whether i'm big whether i'm full whether i'm hungry whether i have a place to lay my head the bible will tell us in matthew 8 and verse 20 says jesus says unto them the foxes have holes and the birds have net but the son of god don't even have a place to lay his head so i want you to know this morning he was born in another man's stable he was reared in another man's country he ate another man from another man's table he drank from another man's well he wore another man's robe he rode on another man's donkey he preached in another man's pulpit he prayed in another man's garden he was convicted for another man's crime he was hung on another man's cross he was buried in another man's grave but i want you to know this morning he rose again for another man's victory he runs again so you can live a life of freedom you wouldn't have to be bound by sin and not believe let me tell you he didn't have a place to lay his head but he provided a place for you this morning not only a place to lay your head but you can lay that soul in his bosom this morning and if that's what take you you'll be in the heart of the heavenly father so it's not all about what we gain on this side or houses and cars i'd rather be broke with jesus then be rich without him this morning i'd rather drive a hoop teeth than driving mercedes without him this morning i'd rather live in a shack than in a mansion without christ this morning i'd rather have jesus and all this money all the silver all the gold to live without him this morning you can have this whole world you can have all the fame you can have all the fortune you can have all that you just give me christ it's settled for me i remember when i was a young 21 year old 20 years old and that voice spoke to me in my car turned your car around that settled it for me and i trust today something will settle in your heart tonight or this morning rather that you can look back over your former conduct and your duties and your actions and you can turn your steps in your heart toward christ he said brother joe most of us are saved here this morning but some of us are not so we're going to preach evangelistic message and i just trust that you'll just support it this morning allow me to share my heart with you see today is the day of salvation seek god when he can be found you're not promised to walk out of these doors you're not promised tomorrow but you're given this opportunity today you know brother battle will talk about moses is moses began to think on his ways how he had went off on his own school and he know that there was a call of god in his life but he tried to work it all out on his own how many of you try to do it on your own oh we think we're somebody we use our intelligence to try to step ourselves up above somebody else and look down on others that maybe or don't have the fortune to be as intelligent you know they didn't make a 36 or 34 they may have made a 16 on the a.c.t and yet we think we're above them because of our intelligence that doesn't mean anything you know moses tried this he knew he he had been reared he'd been he's been told all his life you're the promised son you're the special one you're going to deliver god's people and what did moses do he did it under moses efforts and not god's effort and any time we go off without god we become failures we become we we look back and we see oh i made this mistake and i hurt this people and i've done this and moses ran from the presence of the lord and he was on the back side of the desert for 40 years wandering around and around and around and it looked like his life didn't amount to much nothing but a sheep herder and that may be where we are this morning just wandering around and around what is my life i felt this call of god but yet here i am hurting my father-in-law's sheep i don't even have my own sheep what have i amounted to in life and no doubt the devil's there just sworn on moses moses look you did this and you did that and you shouldn't have done this and you shouldn't have done that but like like moses many of us we tried on our own and what do we do we scar those that love us and we have our lives full and he already wrote moses name there to honor that word to fulfill that commission and i'm going to tell you i don't care what you're going through this morning god has already saw your name there he's already saw the situation and he's already prepared you to receive that experience that you know that you know that you know that god is real he's not a fictition he's not a story of yesterday but he's a living god he's a present god he's an old-time guy and he's your god this morning see there was a germ of life placed on the inside of moses and it was called the call of god see moses had this call and that call of god led moses to a backside of the desert experience and he came in the presence of the burning bush because of a call that was placed there mama didn't give him that call daddy didn't give him that call god gave him the call and that's why you're here this morning you may have thought you just traveled all these miles to come see family god placed you here because he's got a burning bush for you oh god's got a burning bush it ain't being consumed notice now and the call of god in your life will lead you to that same burning bush program says if you'll realize that you're a son and daughter of god that deposit was made in calvary and you got a checkbook in your hand write anything you want on it there god's promise to take care of it many times we're afraid to sign the check i got paid on friday how many you got paid on friday okay last friday there's bills you got to pay you're not going to write that check out if you doubt that there's money in it no but when you got the confidence that you got the money in the bank you write that check out happily maybe depends on how big it is right but here it is god is telling you that your name on the checkbook is just as good as the father's and i'm going to tell you even like tabernacle you can't exhaust the inexhaustible fountain of life you got a need this morning just write it out this morning he's the knee supply you need healing he's a healer you need deliverance he's your delivery you need salvation he's here to save he's already paid the price you need the holy ghost he's here to drop the holy ghost into your heart this morning see god is infinite and when god speaks it's perfect so don't try to alter it and you find me in there trying to alter god's word if you're trying to make it say this and they can say that just say what it says let god come and bring it to pass see we can't alter god's word we have to alter our thinking that's why the bible will tell us let the mind that was in christ being you because when you take the mind of christ in you then you no longer alter your thinking or his thinking but you alter your thing into him see there's no man that comes into the presence of his own past but when he gets tore up about it how many you got to pass this morning how many would like to come up here this morning if i gave you an opportunity and share with the church what your past was you'd be humiliated some of it ain't more speaking about well the prophet of god would say there's no man that comes into the presence of his past but when he gets tore up for the things that he's done maybe the people that he's hurt the words that he has spoke and moses began to think on his way as an old man here he is now 80 years old and he begins to think i ruined my life i'm 80 years old i thought that when i was a young man i would have done the right thing but now it's too far now i've seen away my day of grace i had my opportunity when i was 40. you know 40 is not old for y'all that's 40. come on amen y'all dead this morning you're awake it's okay here he says now he goes i'm 80 years old and i would have thought i would have done it as a young man when i was in the when i would have done right but now it's too far and the crystal tears rolling down his whiskers and about that time he began to hear something crackling noise on the back side of the hill and he says while he was thinking on his ways he said i'll turn aside and see what that what god had done notice he says i trust that god will bring that burning bush into hearing distance with every person here tonight he goes can we think on our ways and we have people today and we're just playing church but the church the days of playing church has got to be a thing of days gone by we got to get serious with our walk with god we got to serve god or don't serve god why do you want to just uh stay on the middle of the road why do you want to just stay on the fence let me tell you the devil owns defense but god is here to liberate you god is going to bring you freedom god is here to take it and break the chains of bondage off of you something on the inside of you has to be longing i really want to serve god but the pool of the world is so great let me tell you this morning god is here to break the pool off of you if you'll come with a heart that's sincere and look back on your way and say i've done this and i've done that and i'm ashamed of this and i'm ashamed of that but oh god i want to serve you this morning oh god i want to worship this this morning i don't care what they think about i might be out of my head but oh god i don't care you save me you feel me you heal me and you deliver me god let me serve you this morning i'm gonna give you my all this morning god [Applause] notice now moses hughes's intelligence his strength his knowledge his human ability but none of that produced the manifestation of the word none of that none of his effort produced the efforts or the manifestation only the encounter with the burning bush only the encounter with the angel of the covenant produce what moses was supposed to be what moses was god ordained to be and that was the prophet to deliver the people and it's not until you meet that same burning bush it's not until you meet that same christ that same angel that you become the very manifestation of the word of this hour a bride for christ the bible tells us or the prophet of god will tell us in god's commission of moses he said moses slipped off his shoes and started walking in see the angel lord jesus christ was setting in that bush that's why that bush didn't consume because it wasn't the bush that was on fire it was god radiating from the midst of the bush the angel of the covenant was jesus christ he was a rock in the wilderness he was the brass serpent he was in all the patriarchs he was in david and he was down through the new testament and he's in the church tonight just the same jesus the same yesterday today and forever and notice all the stories that his mom told him didn't produce it all his human ability never produced it but one encounter five minutes in the presence of the angel of the lord gave moses the commission that he knew there was a call in his heart for notice it changed moses's thinking not just for a month not till just the next service or to the special preacher came by no but it changed moses his thinking not his doctrine it changed moses's heart it turned his heart from sheepherder to now to be a man of god commissioned to do what god ordained him to do here he was 40 years he carried the guilt of killing one egyptian and failing to deliver god's people this hung on moses and hung on moses every day he went out to heard the sheep and he was all alone and no doubt satan was there to remind him look you killed this man and you did this and you're nothing but a failure most and it circled around and circled around 40 years he dealt with that but i'm gonna tell you one moment in the presence of the angel one moment in the presence of the burning bush all that guilt left all that sin left all those chains of bondage left moses and now he was coming to his commission [Applause] now he could go back and face his egypt not face egypt as a runaway prophet but as god's anointed servant to deliver the people god's anointed servant to fulfill the scripture he was no longer bound by his failures and his mistakes but now he was free to serve god in whatever capacity the lord desired him notice the mission may have seemed foolish but moses moses found his freedom in the burning bush and i trust this morning if you haven't found that freedom yet you'll find it in this burning bush through the same angel lord that meant moses he's been appearing in evening light's tabernacle he's been appearing at these camp meetings in virginia he's a period in oklahoma he's appearing around the world doing what he's setting the bush on fire to attract the attention of god's elect so that they too can have that same commission so that they too can be set on fire so that they too can enjoy the presence of the almighty and be free from anything that would try to hold over them remember i spoke to you just the other night on you you may have a past but your past doesn't have to have you no you come in the presence of that same burning bush it's here to liberate you from your failures from your mistakes it's here to to give you power and anointing to face your egypt not face your egypt but to conquer your egypt that's what god has called us to do in this hour we're in the midst of laodicea every every tension of man his own evil all the politics every law that they're writing is against us as a believer but if god can turn your attention this morning to him and to his word it'll give you something they can write any law they want but they can't put you back in bonds they can't put you back in chains because the liberator has come and he that the son is made free he's free indeed he's free to serve god he's free to worship god he's free without failures he's free without mistake he's free without his past he's free this morning and if you can experience that freedom i'm telling you oh you couldn't sit there and be quiet you'd understand my god is real he saved me he delivered me he set me free i can't go back to hell i can't go back to the boss i've been liberated i've been free [Music] think about the jews when they when they come out of the concentration camps you couldn't look at one of them and say go back go back no they've been mistreated they've been starved they've been butilized they were made to work when they had no strength and when they came in there and they liberated them the jews made a decree never again never again what about it bride you're liberated this morning but the devil's here constantly trying to put you back in chains it's cause they try to put you back in bondage well there's got to be something rise up from within never again never again i've been liberated i've been set free all the things that i used to do i don't do no more i can't be held accountable to that because i've been forgiven so he'll fill you with the holy boldness that no matter what the obstacles you face there is no devil there's not enough devils to distract you from your commission oh i love it god give you a mission god put a calling in your heart to be the bride and in his presence we find the freedom we find the boldness we find the courage to do what god's called us to do we face in our prayer lines brother aaron can testify with me i was in a prayer line with brother danny seaman we had it here in our easter meetings demons begin to cry out see demons don't want to let you go if they got you i had one cry out i said leave me alone raised up leave me alone say oh you don't picked on the wrong son of god today leave me alone nothing you're coming out because that's our commission oh let me tell you every son and daughter of god deserves to be set free and if you don't believe in casting out of them i'm gonna tell you to come too late but god seen god do it once twice three four however many times god's never walked into a battle but when he come out packing a victory he can do it in an evening life he can do it in virginia he's done in oklahoma he's done an easter camp i'm gonna say he's the same god this morning brother larry and i was praying with a young girl just here a few weeks back and that demon spoke out you can't have her handle bound by change oh before the service was over god had her because his chains ain't strong enough to defeat the power of god no but it's in the presence of the angel chains began to break off when you think on your path the prophet of god would tell us it'll either drive you to god or drive you away from god and i trust this morning some of you this here you can think on the things you've done your past let that drive you to god don't let it drive you away but let it drive you to him this morning maybe you're a backstop or smoking maybe you're in a saloon whiskey drinking and things of that nature you defiled your life to foul others lives so cheated denied the gospel that you're trying to represent maybe you've done these things but won't you turn from it today god is wanting you to be different god wants us to be dead he requires us to be different he don't want us to to live in bondage when he's been he's coming he sent his only son to break those chains of indifference and unbelief and you know the the the reality of our the not the reality but the the haunts of our past see those that can come to him like peter can find mercy and the bible would tell us that god is rich in mercy we find that in ephesians 2 but god who is rich and however however how many of y'all ever met a rich man don't look oh you yeah some of y'all have read him met a rich man i'll tell you you like to be around the rich man don't you man he pays for everything you go to dinner with a rich man he's getting a tab you're driving a rich man around he's filling up the car you stay overnight somewhere he's paying for the tab somebody rich man is fun to be with hannah you want to be friends with the rich man but there's one thing about the rich man he has to go and make more money to replenish what he's already spent but this god that we serve he's a rich man he's a god who's rich in mercy and he never cannot he never has to go back and replenish his mercy he's the inexhaustible fountain of life he's the inexhaustible fountain of mercy and mercy of grace and the fountain of healing and the fountain of the he's a rich god i owns a cat on a thousand he was like you gotta need this money he'll just sell a few so that he can make a way for his sons and his daughters this morning oh my it's so funny sometimes you know you got young kids that think you're rich oh brother joe you're rich when they say you live in a nice house let's say you drive a nice car those things are not not riches those are just things of time things that's gonna perish if you want to look at brother joe and say he's rich look at what god has done for brother joe look what god has done for you if you want to talk about being rich you're rich in mercy some of you've received that mercy in your life some of you that you you wouldn't have given a nickel for but god rich and mercy came by your way and done something supernatural that's being rich oh we're all rich this morning this church is so rich in talent just so i put you on record i had a dream the other night that i could sing i was like god please let that come to pass man i was behind here preaching and started singing brother aaron just tore it up i felt so good i woke up i was like man praise god tried to sing again like oh that was flat so you know the bible says you just gotta stay in your column where with your calls so i'm gonna stay there but god is rich in mercy he's rich in grace he's rich in love he's rich and he's done so much for us never take the opportunity to walk through these doors for granted because it may be your moment and it's not for you it may be your child's moment and not for your child it may be your grandchild's moment that they meet the god that you met they may meet god on the backside of a desert and that burning bush begins to crackle and pop and begin to call their name and draw them to himself see if you can see the day that he was smitten for you then you wouldn't continue to live in sin you will continue to live a halfway christian life if you can see what he'd done for you the price that he paid if you could visually see the nail scars if you could see his back who was stripped with catalyned tails if you could see the nails in his hands and appeared the spear that pierced his side i don't think there would be a one of you today that could stay the same thursday night i drove out to a crash site because i got a call that maybe my brother-in-law was in an accident he may not make it when i got there i asked the officer i said sir i said i just saw the ambulance go by said did they take him to the hospital he said uh they don't take dead bodies to the hospital and i was floored i said he didn't make it he said no he didn't make it he's right over there he's right over there see he's never going to get that opportunity back but you had that opportunity today you had that opportunity today so he said well brother joe this is this is just we're all saved here we're all christians here we may be but there may be some of you struggling with your freedom some of you may be struggling what god has really done for you and yeah you may be free to a certain point and we're going to get a little bit further into this because we have all you know like brother tim would say we got all day i don't plan on preaching to you all day we'll let brother aaron come step up but nevertheless if we could see what he'd done for us if we could see that body laying on a cross for your sins for my sins i woke up this morning at four o'clock in the morning with that image of my brother-in-law in my head i can just imagine if i could see the image of christ visible when he gave up the ghost and said it is finished and every one of you came in mind every one of you passed by his mind it is finished two thousand years later in the midst of laodicea and even like tabernacle i'll pay for this one and that one and that one and that one and that one and that one and that one and that one you'll never get that image out of your head if you can see what he'd done for you he'll run to the cross of calvary they would say that the the roman soldier there that pierced his side and he saw the blackness come and the blood washed out and the water come out of his side and everything and it was all over he began to look back on it and he said he's nothing but almighty god and the prophet of god would say he turned and he looked at his ways and he gave his heart to god at the foot of the cross i wonder how many of us can do that in a sunday service we can push our pride aside and so yeah you know what i'm tired of pretending and let this be your sunday service that you see that visible body that paid that price for you never get that image out of your head crucify so that you could be free hung on a cross so you wouldn't have to hang put in a tomb so you wouldn't have to go there went to hell so you wouldn't have to go to hell he's here today to do something supernatural for each of us that's here he's here today to rewrite your story what satan says it's got to be this way god says no i'm here to rewrite their story see your life doesn't have to end in tragedy but you can come from tragedy to triumph you can rise above it now it may look like everything's going against you you may have been a moses where you're on the backside of the desert and it seems like you're just hurting sheep and you know life has been unfair and you've been dealt a bad hand and you've been in this marriage and that marriage and you know just all these failures but yet today you can rise from tragedy to triumph and you can find your freedom in christ and when you ever find it and experience true freedom there's not enough devils in hell can put you back in bondage there's not enough devils in hell can put you back in bondage pilate they was here in matthew 27 verse 24 when pilate saw that he could not prevail nothing but rather rather but that rather a turmoil was made he took water and he washed his hands before the multitude and saying i am innocent of the blood of this just person notice they couldn't find any fault in christ the pharisees couldn't find fault sadducees couldn't find fault pilate couldn't find fault there was no fault in our lamb the fault is in us the fault is in us and the only way that we'll ever get the blood off our hands is to put it in our heart to accept what he's done but i want you to know this morning there's still a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins or the center the center this morning can plunge beneath that flood and lose all their guilty stains now i was thinking the other day i washed a pair of tennis shoes i was out there to crash site and was walking around and it was about 335 feet 105 yards from the vehicle went off to where it landed and i was walking it down and my feet got muddy in the clay and i began to spray it off and you know there was a stain there i put them in a washing machine got them out of the washing machine there's a stain there but i'm here to tell you there's something about this blood to remove every stain those shoes were clean but they were still stained but i'm here to tell you this morning saints of god when you plunge beneath that blood this morning it removes all the guilty stains there's not a stain the dying thief rejoice to see the fountain in his day and there may i though val as he wash all my sins away ever since by faith i saw that stream thy flowing wound supply redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till i die there's a fountain there's a fountain for every one of us here this morning there's a fountain you got the holy ghost this morning there's a fountain still for you do you come back to that stream and you can be renewed you can be refreshed this morning in his presence some of you young people need a real experience there's a fountain that's open this morning there's a fountain that's here you can just plunge him into that blood this morning and be made clean no more stains of sin and grief on your life but many times we're like that express agent he comes to your house how many likes getting a package from ups and i got a real honest soul right here she raised her hand so quick we do man that ups guy our fedex guy drives up in your house man it's like christmas in july or may or june or may yeah may right we're in may we love to see him drive up but here he come he's got this package big old box and you just run to the door all excited to meet him hey mr ups guy so good to see you and then that box is a bunch of rattlesnakes just hissing around and then fear grips your heart so i don't want this package and that's how the devil does you've been free but he comes to bring the package back and at first you're all excited oh i don't want that package and see in one sense the package is yours but in other sense it's not yours until you sign for it i'm here to tell you you've been free but when that ups agent comes back to your door with that box of rattlesnake you have a choice to make do you sign for it do you sign for fear do you sign for complexes do you sign for depression do you sign for criticalness do you sign for all these things that we're signing up for you sign the ticket that says i accept it but the prophet of god will tell us all you have to do is refuse to have it you know you've been set free you can tell that ups guy take his box and go back to wherever he came from with it well you like me brother joe i'm a nice guy mr devil if you please take this box of rattlesnakes back we can have a real good service this morning if brother joe would get off this line i thought this morning i'll really get behind him we may even start a minute you know we allow fear to come back and it grips us and we can't move we allow complexes worried about what somebody else thinks about us how we're going to worship and it may not be the norm who cares about how what people think about us and we could come with depression and we come with anxieties and we got all these things that we bring into the house of god but i want you to know he's here to liberate you this morning all that you got to do is say mr ups agent i'm not signing for it i refuse to have it the bible says to resist the devil and he shall flee it's time that we as sons and daughters of god show the devil what we're made out of and tell them look i ain't going to take it any longer you can take this stuff back you can't you can't block me mr devil i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i'm made out of stuff that don't bluff i receive my freedom and that entitles me to every promise of god and entitles me to liberation it entitles me to the blessing and every promise in his word it entitles me to healing and deliverance and salvation and i free from depression and i free from fear and i free from anxieties and i free from conflict it entitles me to that this morning you can take your stuff mr devil and go to hell with it i'm a son of god i've been liberated i've been set free from the bonds of seeing this crimp my life see it gives you a boldness when you recognize your freedom when you recognize you're not bound any longer it puts something on the inside of a believer you recognize it's god calling you it's god's placing you it's god positioning you see god didn't call you and position you to be defeated but god called you and positioned you to be a mighty conqueror see the devil would put us in a pawn shop but jesus came to redeem us we've all been in a pawn shop and the problem is that some of us still have pawn shop mentality you got a checkbook with his name on it you can go to macy's and you're going to the pawn shop why get something used when you can get something new why get somebody else experienced when you can get his experience why copy some preacher where you can get the preacher of preachers experience why get go sign up for a doctor's healing when you can get a true healing and a true deliverance oh let me tell you the pawn shop mentality the devil may have put you there because our forefathers are adam and eve sold us into sin but jesus christ had paid the price he paid the ultimate price and you don't have to be in seeing any longer you don't have to be in the pawn shop any longer you can break that pump shop mentality and say i've got a credit card i got a checkbook with the name of jesus written on it i can go down to macy's and get anything i want i can come into the house with god and i can worship and i can praise god because i got a checkbook this morning i can pray for my lost loved ones i can pray for healing i can pray for deliverance i can pray for whatever i need prayer for and god's gonna respond god's gonna answer god's gonna move because why because i recognize i'm not in the phone shop anymore i've been set free reminds me brother brown our brother man tells us about an old story by the crow he called johnny crow he scared all the other crows away that was eaten in the cornfield and this old crow was he was tied up to a fence or to a fence post and he'd go round and round and round and round calling how many know what a crow sounds like close enough that was good enough i got a crow call at home i didn't bring it today it won't scare you what'd you hear a little the croco that's how some of us are coming in the church go go go go god didn't make you a chrome church god made you a dove and he sent you a lamb and the lamb was to follow the dove and now i'm here to tell you this morning that crow went around and around and around starved to death just calling calling calling but someday some poor old man but bam would call him a good man came by and untied him from the fence post all the other crows were flying overhead come on johnny crow come on get up from there come fly with us around and around and around oh that may be for somebody else but they just don't know my story and you see the spirit of god moving the church all the other crows are flying come on johnny get up johnny you can enjoy this look johnny just just come on flap your wings johnny i'm tired i'm tired he had been tied so long that he thought he was tired what am i telling you even like tabernacle i'm telling you the good man of the house has come by even like tabernacle and he's loosed you and understand you've been going around and around and around and around with sin so long that you don't know you that you've been released but one step past that chain you'll realize your freedom one path one step past that chain sin can't hold you any longer fear can't hold you any longer depression can't hold you any longer suicide can't hold you you take that first step past that chain and flap those wings you'll get caught up in the heavenlies because you weren't predestinated to be some crow calling around god has anointed you to be a mighty eagle a flying eagle as you can soar into the heavenlies and experience freedom and liberation and the joys of knowing god in the reality of his word he said the devil may have tied you up but that's a good man jesus christ who redeemed you he cut every string loose from you when you see the rest of them rise into their feet and believe in it go the same way man you see the movement of the spirit and young people begin to move and fall out and just enjoy the presence of the lord come on johnny don't sit there critical johnny don't sit there with that negative mentality i'm tied up you ain't tired no you the the the good man of the house has come by jesus christ he come and paid your price and he cut those strings that's held you bound the prophet god will tell us you're free every one of you jesus cut loose that a long time ago you're not bound any longer on calvary's cause he freed you there he loosed you there you don't have to be bound any longer by your past mistake he set you free at calvary's cross just refuse to have it revelations 1 and verse 5 says and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and he washed us washed us from our sins in his own blood that word washer means loosed so he loosed us from our sins in his own blood he said isn't that wonderful because if you're spiritual minded did you catch it it was his own blood that looks just completely from our sins it was not the blood of a human it was not the blood of god peter would call it the blood of blood of christ paul would call it the blood of the lord and the blood of jesus not three persons but one person there is that revelation again one god the omnipotent jehovah god came down and made himself a body by means of a virgin birth and dwelt in it that it might be the blood of god that would free us loose us entirely from our sins and present us spotless before him with exceeding great joy notice since it was the blood of god it's a perfect blood and if it was a perfect blood that loosed us then it's a perfect loosing you can never be bound again there's therefore now now in this service this morning no condemnation who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect but it's god that justified otherwise it's god that declares you righteous this morning it is he who is he that is condemned but is christ that died he said there it is his death gave us blood the blood has loosed us there is there now no condemnation how can there be there is nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from sin we are free we are guiltless he says don't listen to man listen to the word you are loose by the blood and the revelations of jesus christ he would give a an accommodation or he would give a word of encouragement he said now don't get tied down again by traditions and creeds and organizations we've found that men have taken this message and what a pure unadulterated word it is and men had gone to seed on their own ideas because maybe back then when it started they didn't have all the messages in the table form that we have today to search it out and study it and man come up with their own quotes and their cherry pictures and cherry pick that and put it all together and they come with a little slanted idea but here's what he's saying he said don't take the ideas of man we've got men today don't believe in the prayer line we've got men today they don't believe in an altar call we got men and they don't believe in the movement of the spirit we got men today they they just they go they stay they they anchor down on formalism and don't think you got to move as i said the other day you got song leaders today they sing two songs in the beginning of the preaching two songs at the end and they shut the complete experience of god down why do we do that because it's man's idea we don't want man's idea god has loosed us from man's idea god's freed us from man's idea what i want i want a pentecostal idea and i'm not talking about azusa street i'm talking about the first pentecost i'm talking about an upper room where we stagger out of here like drunk men and they begin to wonder oh what's going on with these look at them they're staggering out even like tabernacle they're off in the highways they're all drunk sagging out like a bunch of drunk men well but there's got to be a spokesman step up and say you know what you know what this is this is that this is what joel prophesied about this is what he said i'll pour out my spirit in the last days it goes beyond the mentality of man it goes beyond the traditions of man it goes beyond their thinking if what because it's freedom when god sees forth the holy ghost he sees a chain breaker in the myth he said i'm gonna do it i don't care what man says about it i'm gonna throw out my spirit i'm gonna feel young people i'm gonna feel young men i'm gonna feel young women i'm gonna fill them with my power my presence and they may act completely insane but it doesn't matter because this is that oh tell you what you can keep that if you ain't got this because you can't take me to something better i'll keep this until that comes well brother joe you look foolish i don't care i've looked stupider in my days you ain't gotta agree with me brother tony oh i looked man but when i was out in the world serving the devil under sin i did stupid stuff stuff i'm not proud of that's right but this is that that's why i could preach sometimes i may preach and it may be all over the place but i'll tell you if you understood the joy that i have and knowing where i've been and where i'm headed and what he's done for me those chains of sin those chains of alcohol those chains of just that that that unrighteous life is gone and let me tell you i've never woke up since the day i gave my heart to the lord and wished that i could go back because this is that you can let the naysayers say what they want this is that the problem is they're tied up problem is some of them been loose we've been having all these meetings the good man's coming by and then loosen them and loosen them in time but they keep going around in a circle because why it's a tradition oh johnny crow walked around and around and around and around and sometimes that's our problem some of you can't come to the alt summit you can't offer up praise and worship of god because i understand you may have gone around and around and it seems like the devil's constantly buffing to you and buffing you but i'm here to tell you this morning he's already loosed you and it's a perfect loose thing it's a perfect blood it's that bloody shoe this morning ain't no devil can take you back and tie you back to that post because why you've experienced your freedom you found your freedom in jesus christ you found your freedom in this world you found your freedom in this message this message was sent to liberate sons and daughters of god they want to say when they left this message they found liberty no you didn't no you didn't you went back to bondage oh let me tell you i know what i'm talking about i came out of the world went to a baptist church went from a baptist church to a methodist church from a methodist church to assembly church i never found what i got today oh i can tell you they ain't free they're not free because the bible says he that the son is made free is free what is this message it's a message from the son declaring you free see redemption means that the devil put you in a pawnshop but jesus come to take you out that old crowd had been tired so long till he still thought that he was tired he didn't know that somebody had redeemed him i wonder about some of us tonight or this morning brother man i said that's moving a lot of people tonight friends you've been in sin so long serving the enemy until you think you're still tired and you're really loose he goes oh let's go to calvary tonight let's get out of the things of the world oh my he's wonderful know that we're free and who that the son is made free is free indeed see we find in john 8 and verse 33 or verse 32 jesus tells me says now and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and notice their response and they answered we be abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how saith thou you shall be made free see they were in bondage but they didn't realize they were held bondage harriet tubman we all know who she is the underground railroad harriet tubman made a statement she goes i freedom a lot of slaves and i would have freed them many more if they only recognized they were slaves i sleep ah i liberated i freed a lot of slaves and i would have freed a lot more if they had only recognized that they were slaves so we find people today they can't be freed because they don't realize they're slaves they're okay with just coming to church they're okay with just a halfway christian life they're okay with just you know just going through the motions church has got to be more than going through the motions when he's come during emancipation a proclamation what was that a declaration that all slaves could be free some slaves were freed and they thrived other slaves needed a master see slave mentality is in the mind while others like johnny crow never come to the realization that the change of darkness has broken off their life and they go around and around and around and around and though they're free they were servants to the post they never come to realize the joy and the promises of serving god they never experienced a life of victory to worship without condemnation they never experience coming into church and can offer true praise without a guilty conscience it's no different than a man who's married to a woman but he cheats on her and commits adultery he can never give his spouse true intimate relationship because his conscience condemns him and sometimes that's what we bring into the house of god a guilty conscience but i want you to know you've been liberated you've been set free let's do away with slave mentality you'll find people they carry baggage after baggage after baggage and they just keep coming and they keep coming and you know and it gets heavier and heavier as the years pass and whether you know it or not you become a slave to that baggage some of us it's negativity some of us is complex and some of us is nervous some of this depression fear anxieties all these other things and we become a slave to those things and we always ask god why me god when you ask why me that's slave mentality why me why me you know god doesn't make one mistake so that tells me we should never ask him why me god chose you he saw something in you that you didn't see in yourself and he knew there's something that can rise above the situation that you're facing but we find we have all these things and and they weight us down year after year and we think well this is just normal i have to live with this church is anything but normal when jesus died on the cross he paid for everything all your redemptive blessings don't bring in depression in the house of god and take it home with you and live with it and cater to it and and pamper it and all this stuff and say well it's just who i am as part of my makeup no it ain't that's what the devil wants you to know he's trying to put you back in a pawn shop but you've been free sons and daughters of god it's anything but normal it may be common but it's not normal see they didn't recognize here that they were in bondage and until you recognize that you're in bondage you can never be set free they saw themselves as god's chosen people not slaves to sin not slaves all these different things but yet at the same time they were held bondage they wanted to worship god when the spirit passed by they just clamped down because there was something that they couldn't be intimate with god for and so they they just wouldn't worship they wouldn't praise god and so we find church that it's like an eagle brother man talked about the eagle in the cage he said this bird was destined for the heavenly skies and he was he was meant to soar in the heavenlies but now he's in a cage and he's beating his head his brain's out trying to get loose and he said if i could just raise enough money i'd pay the price to get that eagle out of that cage and he said i thought of a more pitiful sight than that and that's a man who's caved with sin i watched a man caged in sin alcohol drive him to an early grave there was an eagle behind that destined to get out and there was a way that was already made there was a price that's already been paid but you got to recognize where you are if you ever plan on climbing out of that jail cell you got to recognize that you're an eagle johnny crow would cry out i'm still tired i'm still tired he wanted to worship he says i can't worship i'm tired i can't overcome i'm tired i can't be healed i'm tired i can't receive the holy ghost i'm tired i can't praise god i'm tithed i can't surrender my all i'm tithed see but we've been freed from our past but he didn't recognize it we've been free from man's idea but he didn't recognize we've been free from denominational cages but he didn't recognize we've been free from formalism but he didn't recognize it but one step past that chain one step past that chain is all you need to do to this morning to recognize your freedom one step past that depression so you can't hold me anymore you're free this morning but obama say that's the way it is with men and women tonight who don't know their position and christ the devil may have tied you with tb may have tied you with cancer may have tied you with many things but christ a good man has stood your judgment now has set you free you know in the in the days of slavery the days of slavery the the slaves were bound and we find that this is back in the days early days not back in the early 1800s or anything of that nature this is going back to egypt we found there was a law that there was a jubilee year and no matter what they've done they sold their children to slavery and the sound of that jubilee trump they could be made free and we find though that many times they knew that that day was going to come maybe it was the next morning and they knew the jubilee was going to be just around the corner and we'd find here that the slaves would begin to climb to the top of the mountain you know it was a struggle some of them had to climb and some could climb further than others some could a little bit more stamina they could come a little bit higher than others and we find that they would climb up to the top of that mouth and when they see the sun rose they knew then that they were free and they'd begin to cry back down and back down you're free you're free you're free you're free and no matter what they was doing in the valley they may have been hoeing for the master they may have been beat they may have been kicked they may have been done this and done that what he's telling you this morning you're no longer bound you're free this morning you no longer have to live in sin you can go home and be free you don't have to owe any debts he goes you can drop that cigarette you can jump that chew in the back and you can drop that whiskey bottle you can drop anything that's binding you you're free this morning ladies can quit wearing makeup they can quit cutting their hair men can start cutting their hair and wear manly clothes you're free this morning you don't have to let society rule you i'm here to tell you you're free this morning he's already paid the price you may have come in here a slave but you can walk out free you can throw that old hoe down and turn around and look at that slave master and say you can't touch me again you can't take me again you can't put this sin on me again you can't put your whip on me again i'm free this morning i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i've been set free by the blood of the lamb i'm never going back i'm going home to my family i'm going home to my children i'm going home to my wife i'm going home to my house i'm going back to my home i'm going to be different because i'm free you can turn around say you have no more rule over me you have no more rule over me i'm going home i'm no more servant you can drop your whole church the emancipation proclamation is sounding out this morning this message is your freedom this message this message declares that whosoever the son is made free is free indeed but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sin forever he sat down at the right hand one sacrifice he said brother joe well i got i'm not worthy you're right you're not worthy but god's not looking at you he's looking at your lamb brother joe i've done this and i've done that i l i didn't live true i've been a drunkard i've done all these things that's right you may have done all that but god ain't looking at you he's he's looking at your lamb he's going to examine your land and if your lam's been accepted you're going to be accepted i'm going to tell you church your lamb has been accepted all your lamb has been accepted this morning you don't have to look at yourself you look at yourself you see your failures you see your mistakes you see your scar but if you can look to the land this morning that lamb paid your price that lamb is your sacrifice and i'm gonna tell you it's a perfect lamb it's a sinless slam and that lamb played it for you and you're free this morning you're free to worship a living god you're free to experience the joys of the lord you're free to get drunk in the holy ghost you're free to speak in tongues you're free to dance you're free you're free and don't you ever ask to underestimate jesus and what he will do well he said well he don't do that in my church that's fine that's your church but in this church he's free he's free to move however he wishes and he's here today to break chains off of your life he says now god in the beginning when he saw sin he saw what had happened and he spoke the word and jesus was a was a slain jesus was slain before the foundation of the world and every person was saved was saved according to the bible when the lamb was slain in the mind of god before the foundation of the world so every person was saved before the foundation of the world you were there in his mind you were there on the cross you were there in hell you were there when he rose again oh church so he that the s he that the son is made free is free indeed and when god slayed the sun before the foundation of the world he was just as much slain then as he was at calvary it's a finished product when god said so see it's god's that's called us it's god that chose us in christ it's all god nothing that we had to do with the church didn't call you man didn't call you god called you god began to move on your heart god began to deal with that life some of you were here this morning not because man called you god called you god placed that burden in your heart to come and say what is it all about what is it what's going on in even light what's happening down there god's calling and romans 8 1 says therefore there is now no condemnation no demolitory sentence to them that are in christ jesus who walked knock out through the flesh but after the spirit of god for the law the spirit of life in christ jesus has made us free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin he condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not out to the flesh but after the spirit see when man sinned there was a chasm that separated man and god there was no way to bridge that chasm there was no way to get back god accepted a substitute but that substitute can never bring man back fully in the presence of god but when god sent his predestinated lamb jesus christ it not only breached the chasm but it completely took the chasm away and the prophet of god would say and now there's not even a chasm there man and god become father and son again oh church if you recognize where we were and what god had done for us he said that don't even cover he said you talk about the blood of bulls and goats it only covers sin but see we're talking about a blood that can not only cover sin but it annihilates sin not only bridges the chasm but it takes the chasm away and we find that in micah 7 and verse 18 the bible will tell us who is god or who is like unto thee that pardon iniquity and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage he retained it not his anger forever because he delighteth in mercy here it again he's a god who's rich in mercy in verse 19 he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and thou will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea one thing about god god is infinite we are fine like we can forgive but we never will forget but god is so big that not only does he forgive he forgets about it he throws it over and to see is his forgiveness he don't even have one memory one trace of your sin if you'll just put it in the blood and there's a power in that blood it's a power dissociation and when that sin drops into that blood it dissociates it and it goes back on the head of the enemy until the time of judgment i'm gonna tell you this morning you're free this morning the blood of jesus has disassociated you in your past that chasm has been bridged you're no longer held by sins change and unbelief you're sons and daughters of god we can forgive but we never forget he can forgive and he never remembers mercy he never remembers brother johnny that passed he has no memory of it for the tony that pass no remembrance for the jeremy that passed what are you talking about he don't know so why don't we keep bringing it up we're free i found my freedom in christ i found my freedom as a young boy i longed to serve god but i let peer pressure pull me here and pull me there i was good in athletics i let athletics drive me here and drive me there very driven but one day i found him oh i may have tried to try to find freedom in a bottle or find freedom in a bar find freedom in a party find freedom in this and find freedom in that i never found that peace i never found that freedom but one day one day i found my freedom in him and if you can ever find that freedom church it'll set you on fire you say bro joe do i gotta act like you nope don't act like me we don't need that mercy me popcorn all over the church everybody popping up no be who god's called you to be but worship him praise him joe do i got to shout nope you could just throw your hands up let the devil know that god's done something he's freed you and you're no longer in the pawn shop you're no longer johnny crow just going around going through the motions just living a halfway christian life no you begin to flap those wings and soar in the heavenlies notice john if i'm start bringing this down to a close start bringing it down to close john 15 and verse 14 says you are my friends this is what he's done for you this morning you are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you henceforth i call you not servants make this personal this morning i'm no longer calling you servants but i'm calling you sons i'm calling you daughters i'm calling you free i'm calling you guiltless blameless god's calling you this morning for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you you're here this morning because god's choosing god's calling and god's ordination you're not here by happenstance you're not here by mistake tori god moved you from arkansas here because you've got a part to play leaving like tabernacle chloe god moved you from alabama to take part of some special meetings and to be a part of a special church not that your church family there wasn't any better but god's got a part for you to play here god called you and he's called you friends he didn't call you his enemy he didn't pronounce judgment on you but he's called you friend free free to worship and today church we did not become seed because we could be reborn but we could be reborn because we were always seed brother william you didn't become seed because you were reborn but god before the foundation of the world placed a seed on the inside of you and at a certain time a certain age a certain service in the right atmosphere the spirit of god stroked that seed and because there was a seed there rebirth could take place oh church what does that rebirth that's your freedom that's where the chains of the world begin to fall off when you recognize i'm a seat of god and some of you this morning you got children out in the world and let me tell you it looks hopeless for some of them it looks like there's no hope it's useless we might as well give up but the prophet of god said a son of god can go a long time before he ever recognizes he's the son of god and brother e.j i know you're streaming with your father a son of god can go a long time before he ever recognizes he's the son of god you know that sun may resist that sun may be hardened that sun may just he may push back and push back and push back but eventually the light of that word is going to strike that seed okay see some of us were cultivated in good ground some of us are under concrete but if there's a seed in there that seed is going to come to life he that the sun is made free will be free there ain't enough devils in hell to keep that child that son of god down let me tell you we've heard it and we've heard and we've heard it but the devil don't have enough he doesn't have enough some of you that got kids out there in the world you need to be claiming every morning call their name before god in prayer god you said it ain't enough devils in hell can keep my daughter down keep my son down keep my husband down keep my wife down there ain't enough devils in hell can keep me down not when we've been free notice redeem means to buy back it's restored back to the original god by his death shed blood brought back his own he says my sheep hear my word and they will follow me you always was a sheep that's right for the hell you never was a pig you never was a dog just a felicia you always was a sheep think about that well i'm in my 50s i'm in my 40s we just come to the message three years ago you may have just came three or four years ago but she always was sheep you always was seed see a son of god can go a long time but if there's a seed that was deposited before the foundation of the world there ain't enough devils in hell can cover it up can stop it from coming to life it's gonna find its way to come to the word and when it comes to the word and when the word comes to the word what happens it brings forth freedom it brings forth life it brings forth jubilee it brings forth emotion it brings forth praise it brings forth adoration it brings forth victory i'm here to tell you this morning it brings this focus as well it ain't the work of a man it's the work of almighty god only god can put that together only god can put that together only god can bring this substance into that and bring it to this son and create life only god can do that only god can call a man from his depths of sin and despair and place him and make him a real son of god don't try to impersonate it he said that's what the matter with pentecost that's what's the matter with the church today too many trying to impersonate that they got the holy ghost too many trying to impersonate divine healing i'm sorry but the days of impersonation are gone now we're criticized for the movement of the spirit now we're criticized for praying out loud now we're criticized for altar calls now we're criticized for young people getting victory we're criticized you're not criticizing us you're criticizing him you're blaspheming the holy spirit for what he does in a life if you'd have been miriam and look back over your taskmasters that depression that had you bound and you just drug yourself to the house of god praying one day was gonna be your day oh maybe you came with fear and it had you bound and you were scared to go do this he was afraid to do that or maybe it was complexes he thought everybody was against you nobody loved you nobody cared for you but one day when you cross the other side and you step foot on the other side of that shore and you look back and all those task managers that beat you that ridiculed you that spit upon you and maybe raped you and did all these things to you when you realize they're all drowned in the sea it gives you a freedom i'm gonna tell you you can find your freedom in the red sea and that red sea is the holy ghost this morning it's the blood of jesus christ it liberates every chain it breaks every path it frees you from yesterday it frees you from the guilt it frees you from everything that ever was produced on you i'm gonna tell you this morning church if you could just be like man you can realize i don't have to be bound i'm no longer a son or a servant i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i've been liberated i cross through my red sea and almighty god and save me and deliver me and now i'm on my way to the promised land my egypt is destroyed it's behind me i'm not going back to egypt i'm going over jesus i'm going on with christ i'm headed to a promised land i'm into a heavenly home my pawns are broken my chains are done i'm free i found my freedom in health i found my freedom this morning

don't have enough as i end it with this very familiar quote but obama would tell these servants of god were held in prison brother branham they said deliver us from this this is a house of hell you've been misunderstood you've misunderstood these people these are fine people but i looked over there in a great big cellar big walls down below the great big cave great iron bars eight to ten inches thick people out of their mind twisted arms legs beating their head like that and they were crying saying deliver the people brother brad the voice of the people crying for freedom deliver me oh thou son of david have mercy on me this morning of galleria out of his mind but when he came to himself for a split second god be merciful god be merciful you don't know the hour you don't know the minute you don't know the time when that child cries out god remember me forgive me lord they never never come to a justified state remember never be filled with the holy ghost but don't deny them salvation because those that call upon the name of the lord shall be saved shall be saved deliver the people brother branham they said help us we're in trouble see yourself i know where she belongs believe the church of christ a good christian a christian church or called the church to the brothers looked around i wished i could i go on looking around a little bitty body in them great big iron bars and those poor people in there if you couldn't get to them those iron bars were sitting so close and i looked they were just beating their head like that they were out of their mind they wanted to be free you ever been in a place when you want to be free so bad you want to be delivered so bad you want relief so bad it'll almost drive you out of your head i almost drive you and here they are and i seen some lights flicking around in there and i looked up and stood the lord jesus with light of a rainbow around them and he was looking right straight at me and he said deliver the people and he went away and i thought how could i deliver them i haven't got enough strength in my arms to break those bars so i said house of hell give way to the name of jesus jesus christ and all the cracking and popping and the rocks and rolling bars are falling people running screaming delivered and screaming at the top of their voice and was all delivered i'm gonna tell you you may be feeling like you're in
