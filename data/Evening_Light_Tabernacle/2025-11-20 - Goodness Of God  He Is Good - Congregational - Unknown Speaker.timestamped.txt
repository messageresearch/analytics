[0:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:03] Amen. [music] We're thankful for all
[0:04] that God's done for us. And
[0:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Looking back at how good he's been
[0:09] and [music] I was just away this week
[0:13] and at a conference of burn survivors
[0:16] and uh very [music] very sad stories
[0:20] many times of people being burned so uh
[0:23] incredibly and very disfigured. And
[0:26] [music] there was a lady there, her name
[0:27] was Chi-Chi, and she's from Nigeria.
[0:30] She was 14 years old. She was [music]
[0:33] um cooking over an open fire there and
[0:35] she had an epileptic seizure and fell
[0:38] straight into the fire and um suffered
[0:40] [music] severe burns on her face. She
[0:43] had severe um disfigurement and blinded
[0:47] and um [music]
[0:49] so they had an open mic thing and they
[0:51] helped her onto the stage and she stood
[0:53] there and she [music] talked about how
[0:54] good God was to her how wonderful he'd
[0:57] been in her life and without anybody
[1:00] being there to give a key she stood in
[1:02] front of an entire group of people and
[1:05] said all my life you have been [music]
[1:07] faithful.
[1:10] Amen. And I think we can tell him that
[1:12] all my life
[1:15] you've been so [music]

[1:25] life. I'm going to give you everything
[1:27] this morning." [music]

[1:41] fire
[1:44] in the darkest night. [music]
