[22:03] in our Bibles if we can to Psalms
[22:05] chapter 37 verse 34 Psalms chapter 37
[22:12] verse 34 I'd like to read down I see
[22:25] here
[22:32] make sure I get the right the right
[22:34] scripture here just second I see chapter
[22:46] 37 verse 7 I'm sorry a second there we
[23:04] go okay yeah I've got my scripture mixed
[23:07] round here just a second
[23:09] yeah Psalms 37 verse 7 it says rest in
[23:14] the Lord and wait patiently for him fret
[23:19] not thyself because of him who
[23:21] prospereth in his way because of the man
[23:24] who bringeth wicked devices to pass
[23:27] cease from anger and forsake wrath and
[23:31] fret not thyself in any wise to do evil
[23:36] for evildoers shall be cut off but those
[23:40] that wait upon the Lord shall inherit
[23:43] the earth and I want you to go down to
[23:46] verse 34 it says wait on the Lord and
[23:51] keep his way and he shall exalt thee to
[23:56] inherit the land when the wicked are cut
[23:59] off thou shalt see it I want to preach
[24:03] tonight on wait upon the Lord and I
[24:05] would like to subtitle my message
[24:08] tonight on exalted to inherit the land
[24:11] may God bless the reading of his word
[24:13] you can have your seats I want to take
[24:18] my time this evening Moses his whole
[24:23] Commission his whole purpose his entire
[24:28] ministry was to take the people out of
[24:32] Egypt and bring them into the land of
[24:36] promise and to a land that flowed with
[24:39] milk and honey and I'd like to read in
[24:42] Deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 1
[24:45] referring to a lot of scriptures tonight
[24:47] if you want to write those down
[24:49] deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 1 they said
[24:52] all the commandments which I command
[24:54] thee this day you shall observe and do
[24:57] that you may live and multiply and go in
[25:01] and possess the land which the Lord
[25:03] swear unto your father's and thou shalt
[25:06] remember all the way which the LORD thy
[25:09] God led thee these forty years in the
[25:11] wilderness to Humble them to prove thee
[25:14] to know what was in thine heart whether
[25:17] thou wouldest keep his Commandments or
[25:19] no and he humbled thee and suffered the
[25:23] to hunger and fed thee with manna which
[25:25] thou knowest not and neither did the
[25:27] fathers know that he might make thee
[25:30] know that man does not live by bread
[25:34] only but by every word that proceedeth
[25:37] out of the mouth of the Lord death man
[25:39] live dine raiment wax not old a palm be
[25:44] and neither did thy foot swell these 40
[25:47] years thou shall also consider in thine
[25:51] heart that is a man Chason at the Sun so
[25:55] the Lord chasing at thee therefore thou
[25:58] shalt keep the commandment of the Lord
[26:00] thy God to walk in his ways and to
[26:02] fearing for the LORD thy God bringeth
[26:06] thee into a good land a land of Brooks
[26:09] of water in the fountains and of depth
[26:12] that spring out of the valleys and the
[26:14] hills a land of wheat and barley and
[26:17] vines and fig trees and pomegranates in
[26:20] a land of oil and oil olive and honey a
[26:26] land wherein thou shalt eat bread
[26:28] without scare sness and thou shalt act
[26:31] that shall not lack anything in it a
[26:34] land whose stones are earned and out of
[26:38] those whose hills thou mayest big brass
[26:42] and when thou has eaten and thou art
[26:44] full then thou shalt bless the LORD thy
[26:47] God for the good land which he hath
[26:50] given you what a wonderful place this
[26:53] was what a wonderful
[26:56] the nation that the exodus was but you
[27:00] know in order to get there Moses had to
[27:03] have patience because it was only a four
[27:07] days journey out of Egypt a four-day
[27:10] journey that would take 40 years and you
[27:13] find that Moses had to have patience he
[27:17] had to have patience with the people who
[27:19] did not understand what God was doing
[27:22] that did not understand the way that God
[27:25] had led him and the people had become
[27:28] impatient they beat the Bible said they
[27:31] become impatient because the way was
[27:33] hard and they didn't understand why a
[27:36] good God that loved him that would call
[27:38] him out of bondage that would call him
[27:40] out of slavery what God would lead them
[27:43] into a wilderness of sin a land a
[27:47] wilderness where and wherever they
[27:49] turned there was no water there was no
[27:51] food there everything was the rough way
[27:54] and that's the way God's Way is you find
[27:58] the people misunderstood and Moses he
[28:01] had to wait for the land that God
[28:03] promised him he had to be patient with
[28:06] the people and he had to wait for the
[28:08] people to catch the vision and he said
[28:13] now that Moses he said I give you the
[28:16] land I give every bit of it to you it is
[28:19] yours I give you the title deed you your
[28:24] name is on the deed but when they got
[28:27] there they found the whole land was
[28:29] swarming with Giants and Hittites and
[28:31] parasites and Philistines had and they
[28:34] begin to faint because of the size of
[28:38] the Giants that was on their god-given
[28:40] land and they begin to cry with a glass
[28:44] how person aside and and die maybe God
[28:47] didn't look at that detail that try and
[28:51] fill this land and we are not warriors
[28:55] we're simple family people we can't take
[29:00] and the people brother madam said the
[29:03] problem was not with the promise of God
[29:06] the promise was with the mixed multitude
[29:09] because caleb rose up and stilled the
[29:12] people and said they're bred for us we
[29:15] are more than able cuz God said so but
[29:20] it was the mixed multitude that calls to
[29:23] everyone to be upset and to begin to
[29:26] question whether the land was really for
[29:30] them or not
[29:31] how many knows that that was a type and
[29:34] shadow of the day that we're living in
[29:37] and then this message is to bring us
[29:42] into a land of promise and beautiful
[29:46] promises of God and to the full
[29:48] Pentecostal power into the full
[29:51] character of Christ into the full love
[29:54] of God this message is to bring us here
[29:57] to embody change it is an exodus out of
[30:06] out of unbelief into true faith it is an
[30:10] exodus out of artificial Christianity
[30:13] into the real genuine experience but the
[30:21] call come out of her brought a mixed
[30:24] multitude and we got to be patient in
[30:28] these times you're writing it down
[30:32] Psalms 37 verse 3 said trust in the Lord
[30:36] and do good and thou shall dwell in the
[30:39] land verily thou shalt be fed Psalms 27
[30:45] verse 13 said I have fainted unless I
[30:48] believed to see the goodness of the Lord
[30:50] in the land of the living
[30:51] wait on the Lord be of good courage heal
[30:56] strengthen your heart wait I say on the
[31:00] Lord you know a lamb all he does is
[31:05] follow the shepherd
[31:07] all the llamas got to do is faithfully
[31:10] follow and the and the Shepherd will
[31:13] leave you man
[31:15] but when we begin to question the
[31:17] promises of God and begin to become
[31:21] impatient with the promises of God then
[31:24] we find ourselves in trouble as brother
[31:28] Branham said impatience is one of the
[31:31] great ruins of our American heritage
[31:34] because everyone is in a hurry
[31:37] every one of us we wake up we go to work
[31:40] we race to the day we race back home and
[31:44] it's just like a busy hamster wheel
[31:46] he said everybody is in a hurry people
[31:50] flying around you he said pressure is
[31:53] because it's a neurotic age and
[31:56] everything is under pressure and we've
[31:58] got to meet certain criteria we got to
[32:01] make certain demands and you know all of
[32:04] our easy livin we just cram more into a
[32:07] life of easy living turn our minds can't
[32:11] even keep abreast or keep up with the
[32:14] demands of society and social media
[32:17] communicate with 15 different people at
[32:19] one time and it's pressure and brother
[32:22] branham said even Christians are under
[32:25] pressure and he said what pressure
[32:29] dances make us make decisions that we
[32:32] normally would not make if we were not
[32:34] under pressure
[32:35] it makes us snap but one another it
[32:38] makes us you know keyed up and and in a
[32:41] hurry and I just want to get it behind
[32:44] me and brother branham said if satan can
[32:47] get you pressured you're just about
[32:49] whipped and he said our age is an erotic
[32:52] age why he said because god is left out
[32:58] and when we become impatient with our
[33:02] daily life when we become impatient even
[33:06] in our own little world that we live
[33:09] and we begin to leave God out of our
[33:11] decisions and leave God out of our daily
[33:15] life when we leave him out then we
[33:19] become impatient and we begin to do
[33:23] things that normally we wouldn't do
[33:26] brother Branham said after 31 years of
[33:29] ministry after the toils of the field I
[33:33] want to make my testimony to this and
[33:37] I've seen disappointments I've seen the
[33:40] time where I asked things I cried for
[33:42] things
[33:43] I bet for things and I didn't get them
[33:46] but if you wait patiently upon God then
[33:50] know that it works exactly right it'll
[33:54] come out exactly right if I wait
[33:58] patiently upon the Lord how many I would
[34:02] love to say lord help me not to be
[34:05] impatient help me to wait upon you every
[34:08] day writing it down in Hebrews chapter 6
[34:12] verse 11 he says and we desire that
[34:15] every one of you do show the same
[34:18] diligence to the full assurance of hope
[34:21] unto the end that you be not slothful
[34:24] but followers of them who through faith
[34:28] and patience inherit the promises for
[34:32] when God made a promise to Abraham
[34:34] because he could swear by no greater he
[34:37] swear by himself surely his blessing I
[34:41] will bless thee in multiplying I will
[34:43] multiply thee and so after he had
[34:46] patiently endured he obtained the
[34:49] promise how wonderful
[34:52] notice this Abraham was given an
[34:55] immutable promise by God that could not
[34:58] God could not go back it was an
[35:01] unconditional promise meaning no matter
[35:04] what happened whatever he faced no
[35:06] matter what Abraham is gone
[35:09] to enhance this promise but we find that
[35:13] Abraham is sitting on a barren land
[35:17] Locke took the wet water plays and
[35:22] Abraham as brother Peter said Sam is
[35:25] cranky that day because Lot's wife is
[35:29] down there were the caravans all the new
[35:32] hats and all the new bonnets and hell
[35:34] all those things in this godforsaken
[35:38] desert flies are in my kitchen that
[35:42] creaky step is driving me crazy
[35:45] Abraham had to fix it I'm so sick and
[35:51] tired air conditioning the flats on the
[35:55] tent ain't even working right they don't
[35:57] even open zipper stuck my kitchen it's
[36:02] hot in here flies are everywhere talking
[36:06] about a promise son I've heard it 25
[36:09] years there's a reason why Abraham was
[36:13] on the outside of the tent
[36:18] [Applause]
[36:19] Abraham learned he had lots a good
[36:24] communion out there but the backside of
[36:27] the desert what day as he waited he grew
[36:31] stronger I'm not giving up he's gonna
[36:37] come he swore by himself
[36:42] he looked at one day they saw three men
[36:44] coming brother branham said he kept
[36:47] himself in a spiritual atmosphere they
[36:51] said when he looked the men had deft on
[36:53] their clothes as they were walking I
[36:56] love the way God operates he could have
[36:59] just passed it off is another day it's
[37:02] another pilgrim
[37:03] that's another Wednesday night service
[37:06] just another day but he was spiritual
[37:10] and he knew one day that church would
[37:13] service would be different one day God
[37:18] would come by himself and he was
[37:25] faithful brother Branham said he run out
[37:29] to meet him Bible said because thou has
[37:35] kept the word of my patience he said
[37:41] that word he said why the word patience
[37:48] after he had patiently endured he
[37:52] obtained the promise you see the Spirit
[37:55] is speaking about the word to wait for
[37:58] the fulfillment of that word requires
[38:01] patience as it did in the case of
[38:05] Abraham he enjoyed seeing him who is
[38:08] invisible he was patient and then the
[38:12] word was finally fulfilled and this is
[38:16] the way God teaches his people patience
[38:21] see if he fulfilled the word in a
[38:24] physical manifestation the very instance
[38:27] you pray you had never learned patience
[38:29] but you would become more impatient with
[38:32] life he said let me show you the truth
[38:35] of this so he goes into a Joseph how
[38:40] until the time that the word came the
[38:44] word of the Lord
[38:45] hiding so meaning though God gave Joseph
[38:48] a promise he had to patiently wait for
[38:52] that promise to come to pass
[38:54] and then God gives us exceeding precious
[38:58] promises his promise to fulfill every
[39:01] word and from the time we pray till the
[39:05] time we get the answer we must learn to
[39:09] receive patience and ourselves for only
[39:12] of patience do we possess life may God
[39:15] help us to learn this lesson
[39:18] he said we read the history of lives of
[39:21] great Christians and what a contrast we
[39:26] see between their lives who is so
[39:28] patient and so quiet and today we are so
[39:33] overcome with impatience and haste God
[39:41] has sent us a message that will bring us
[39:45] right into the rapture God has sent us a
[39:49] message that will bring us into the body
[39:51] change he has restored the word and with
[39:55] the restoration of the word he will
[39:58] restore all power to his people can you
[40:02] say man and it's at those times that we
[40:07] are believing the Lord that we must be
[40:10] certain of God you must be convinced
[40:14] that this word come from Almighty God
[40:17] you must be confessed that the Prophet
[40:21] is the prophet of Malachi 4 you must be
[40:25] convinced in yourself because if you're
[40:28] not you're gonna fall when the trial
[40:31] comes or when the delay comes so you
[40:36] must be certain in your heart just as
[40:38] certain as Abraham was and would you
[40:41] believe it then take a deep hole
[40:44] don't you back off fall to that word
[40:48] don't let nothing move here and know
[40:52] that this word is going to change your
[40:54] body
[40:55] this word is gonna heal your body this
[40:58] word it's gonna come inside of you and
[41:01] materialize
[41:03] hey man but God loves to test us do you
[41:08] believe that God loves to test us in the
[41:12] trials then it brings her faith to a
[41:17] showdown brother Branham said every son
[41:20] that cometh to God must be tried and he
[41:27] said if you get a little heartache after
[41:31] you're born again a little trial upsets
[41:33] you somewhere you run back to the world
[41:36] it shows you wasn't a child to begin
[41:39] with if any man wants anchors in his
[41:43] heart his heart against Calvary all the
[41:47] Devils in hell will never shake him
[41:50] notice he cannot stand test Iseman he is
[41:54] illegitimate if he claims that God is
[41:57] his father then he's not tossed about
[42:00] with every wind of doctrine he's not
[42:03] thrown about with every trial that comes
[42:05] he's not in one day and out the next he
[42:08] is stable he is that fast he has short
[42:12] put it he has a foundation that doesn't
[42:15] move when we get in a hurry we miss gone
[42:22] when we get impatient we miss God I want
[42:29] you to notice this brother Brennan said
[42:31] I think many a good man have done it he
[42:35] said you get too much in a hurry and you
[42:38] want to do it yourself
[42:39] many a man they go out impatient
[42:43] believing that the time
[42:45] yeah and they tried to do it within
[42:48] yourself wait upon the Lord for they
[42:53] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[42:55] their strength
[42:57] see Sara doubted that's what she laughed
[43:01] at the pen she doubted the supernatural
[43:05] birth she became impatient and she tried
[43:10] to help God out so when she tried to
[43:13] help God out
[43:14] she chose Hagar she goes to the same
[43:17] church and you know I mean it's
[43:19] spiritual why don't ever have be with
[43:22] her and we will call that the promised
[43:25] son and put this behind us and you find
[43:29] when she gave Hagar and Abraham's bosom
[43:32] she brought forth Ishmael which was a
[43:35] wild man an untamed man like a wild man
[43:40] running to the desert his hand was
[43:42] against every man she brought forth a
[43:46] persecutor of the world because every
[43:49] time we tried to pick something with the
[43:52] Word of God
[43:53] it produces death it produces chaos this
[44:00] isn't the promise ishmael become the
[44:04] muslim rice and he's a persecutor who
[44:07] fights against all man you watch the
[44:11] spirit of it claims to be the seed of
[44:13] abraham but a final because Sarah could
[44:19] not wait on God and she wanted to
[44:22] produce it in her own strength this is
[44:26] the natural seed versus the supernatural
[44:29] seed so two seeds are fighting against
[44:35] each other but the Bible tells us to
[44:38] wait upon the Lord can you say man she
[44:44] Sarah produced a loud man but what did
[44:47] God produce when she waited
[44:50] finally that man came and he said I will
[44:54] visit you according to the time of life
[44:57] saris milk veins were tried she had a
[45:00] hump in her back her hair was gray her
[45:04] her throat her voice was weak but when
[45:08] God visited her all the sudden the milk
[45:12] veins came back the heart started
[45:14] pumping right the womb became fertile
[45:17] the hair became black again the sparkle
[45:20] came into the eye her body began to
[45:25] change when she waited on the promise
[45:29] how many say Lord don't give me a
[45:31] substitute let me wait on the promise of
[45:34] the Lord she looked at Abraham Abraham
[45:39] was spending their six-pack V Sara
[45:46] hey his chin Scott he's rippling with
[45:53] muscles head to foot I'm feeling good
[45:56] this morning you're looking at this
[46:00] morning so are you Sara because the time
[46:06] came where God was going to change those
[46:10] helpless bodies into something he could
[46:12] use you know there was absolutely
[46:16] nothing that Abraham and Sara could give
[46:18] that's exactly the way God wanted he
[46:21] loves to take something that it's
[46:23] nothing and make something out of it he
[46:26] never asked us to produce a rapture he
[46:28] never asked us to produce a revival he
[46:31] never asked us to produce Christianity
[46:34] he asked us to believe his word and
[46:37] receive his word and let him live it
[46:40] through us I'm gonna say Lord live it
[46:43] through me pulsated my
[46:46] I live in my thoughts live in my life
[46:50] [Music]
[46:51] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[46:55] their strength
[46:57] Abraham renewed his strength Samri
[47:00] nudist strength they mounted up on wings
[47:04] like eagles strengthened from the inside
[47:08] out how many say Lord start with me
[47:10] tonight
[47:12] you know God wanted to bless Israel and
[47:16] God just hovered over them over the
[47:19] pillar of fire he busied himself he fed
[47:23] them with manna he gave them water from
[47:26] the rock everything they needed he
[47:29] provided their clothes who never got old
[47:30] their feet never got sore God healed all
[47:34] of their diseases and one day brother
[47:37] Branham said they got to looking at
[47:39] their neighbors and they wanted to be
[47:41] king like they had brother Branham said
[47:45] God was going to give them a king in the
[47:47] person of Jesus Christ and he said and
[47:52] he said but he said they were in a hurry
[47:56] and he said God was going to humanize
[47:59] himself in the person of Christ but they
[48:02] got ahead of God and Satan put in their
[48:06] heart to get ahead of the Lord Wow the
[48:12] devil put in their heart to get ahead of
[48:16] God's program and Samuel said you don't
[48:19] want to do it he'll make your children
[48:21] slaves he'll actually put you in bondage
[48:25] you'll serve a man you don't want to be
[48:27] like the other nations you want to be
[48:30] something different and they refused the
[48:33] counsel of Samuel and you find that God
[48:36] raised him up the king by the name of
[48:39] Saul
[48:40] brother Donnie preached a masterpiece on
[48:44] that one night about the Unser endured
[48:47] heart and he said Saul went out and was
[48:49] waiting on Samuel Samuel didn't come
[48:54] yesterday and then and the people were
[48:57] shaking in their boots because the
[49:00] Philistines and you'll find that when
[49:03] Samuel was just a bit late what happened
[49:07] with Saul women begin to sacrifice unto
[49:11] Lord and brother branham said as soon as
[49:14] he did it it took the leadership from
[49:17] God and put it on a man and as soon as
[49:20] it did the Prophet turned us back and
[49:23] God turned his back and he said he will
[49:26] every denomination that turns away the
[49:29] Spirit of God he said God will turn his
[49:31] back on it God will turn his back on us
[49:37] if we reject the spirit brother Branham
[49:41] said give God time God is in no hurry
[49:45] we're the ones that get in a hurry just
[49:48] give God a little bit of time you'll see
[49:51] those prophetic wheels and cogs come
[49:54] right up it'll develop like a picture
[49:57] you know the Bible tells us though Jesus
[50:02] was a son yet he learned obedience to
[50:05] the things which he suffered and being
[50:08] made perfect he became the author of
[50:10] eternal salvation unto them that obeying
[50:14] in plain language the very character of
[50:19] Jesus was perfected by suffering
[50:22] according to Paul he was left his church
[50:26] a measure of suffering that they to by
[50:29] their faith in God while suffering for
[50:32] him would come to a place of perfection
[50:35] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[50:39] reign with him you have to suffer
[50:42] terrain the reason for this is character
[50:45] simply is never made without suffering
[50:48] character is a victory not a gift a man
[50:53] without character can train because
[50:56] power
[50:57] apart from character satanic but power
[51:00] with character his fit to rule and since
[51:04] he wants to share even his throne on the
[51:07] same basis he overcame and has sat down
[51:10] on his Father's throne then we have to
[51:13] overcome to sit with him
[51:15] this little temporary suffering that we
[51:18] go through now it's not worthy to be
[51:20] compared to the tremendous glory that is
[51:23] to be revealed when he comes oh the
[51:26] treasures that are laid up for those
[51:29] that are willing to enter into the
[51:31] kingdom through much tribulation
[51:33] Peter said think it not strange
[51:35] concerning fiery trials that is to try
[51:39] you see that is what Peter said is it
[51:43] strange that God wants to develop
[51:45] christ-like character that comes through
[51:48] suffering
[51:49] we all have trials we all are tried and
[51:52] chasing the sons not one but goes
[51:56] through it the church that is not
[51:58] suffering that it's not being tried is
[52:01] not of God
[52:03] for whom the Lord loves us he chastens
[52:10] Jesus learned obedience to the things
[52:14] that he suffered if you watch the model
[52:18] of Jesus bear with me tonight if you
[52:22] watch the way Jesus handled himself as a
[52:26] lamb of God when Pilate inquired and had
[52:33] him scourged
[52:34] you never seemed glare at Pilate you
[52:39] never see him lose his temper he was
[52:43] always calm and collective his faith was
[52:46] unconscious faith undisturbed faith he
[52:50] carried himself like a Lamb of God
[52:52] through the trials he never fought back
[52:56] he always looked to God knowing that the
[53:00] trial come from God
[53:02] Paul said be patient in tribulation
[53:08] patient him
[53:10] and suffering enduring and waiting with
[53:15] the determination they say Lord give me
[53:18] a determination in the heart
[53:21] he said because your tribulations
[53:23] worketh patience and that's why John and
[53:29] the olive practise said I John your
[53:31] brother and companion in tribulation in
[53:35] the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ
[53:38] John was preaching the gospel John was
[53:42] the word made manifest and it stirred
[53:45] the region's till they thought we can't
[53:47] have this man in our society he's a
[53:50] witch because the power of God moves
[53:53] around him so they tried to kill him
[53:56] brother Branham said they tried to burn
[53:58] the Holy Ghost out of him and when they
[54:00] put him in a vat of oil the power of God
[54:03] protected it amen he's a wall of fire
[54:08] about us so they banished him till now
[54:11] of Patmos the one who Jesus loved how
[54:17] can God love John and send him to an
[54:20] Alcatraz how can God love John he laid
[54:25] in his bosom he gave up all of his
[54:27] family and friends for the message of
[54:31] the hour how could God do this to him
[54:34] the one whom Jesus loved and all night
[54:39] long
[54:40] banished like some sort of criminal just
[54:44] lizards and snakes of praying you know
[54:47] it was like heaven was shut off but you
[54:51] know God has a way of making our trials
[54:54] of blessing brother Branham said this
[54:57] this is remarkable when John lived he
[55:00] said people were coming from all over he
[55:02] was the youngest so all the Apostles
[55:05] died before him and so people were
[55:07] coming John how should we do this with
[55:10] our church how should we do the music
[55:12] platformer what did Jesus say about this
[55:14] what did Jesus say about that and life
[55:16] was very busy for John he said so he
[55:20] called John away
[55:21] sanim on an island so he could get quiet
[55:24] and it was about the time he got alone
[55:27] with God visions begin to break and
[55:30] those visions he penned for one people
[55:34] in the seven church ages it wasn't for
[55:37] summer no it wasn't perfect IRA it
[55:39] wasn't for the for our Philadelphia it
[55:42] was for you and I when God would open
[55:45] the symbols that was in that book to
[55:48] give you faith to give you courage to
[55:52] let you know you are on his mind God has
[55:58] a way of changing our trials and making
[56:02] it a blessing he said in revelations
[56:05] chapter 2 verse 19 I know thy works and
[56:08] thy charity and thy service and the
[56:11] faith and thy patience and thy works to
[56:15] be last more than the first
[56:18] he said now he does not say like he did
[56:22] in the Church of Pergamos you hold my
[56:24] faith he said he's commending them for
[56:28] their faithfulness see he mentions
[56:31] patience and faithfulness because they
[56:34] go together
[56:35] in fact patience is the outcome of
[56:40] faithfulness because the trying of your
[56:44] faith worketh patience and there is
[56:47] absolutely no other way to gain patience
[56:51] it has to come by the trial of your
[56:53] faith how highly tribulation Romans 5:3
[56:58] tribulation worketh patience and how
[57:01] highly God regards the outworking of
[57:05] patience because he says in James 1 for
[57:08] let patience have her perfect work that
[57:13] you may be perfect entire lacking
[57:16] nothing see it's God's will for our
[57:20] perfection and that perfection is
[57:23] patience waiting on God waiting for God
[57:29] this is the process of character
[57:32] development how highly god commended
[57:35] those Saints in the Dark Ages as patient
[57:38] lambs led to the slaughter lovingly and
[57:42] faithfully they serve God that's all
[57:45] they wanted out of life just service to
[57:48] their Lord and how great was their
[57:50] reward and as darkness of the age
[57:54] increased and the martyrs grew length
[57:57] here day by day they worked harder
[57:59] they served harder and their faith
[58:02] increased nothing is said of increased
[58:06] labor of love in other ages but in this
[58:09] age in the darkest of age they served
[58:12] him even more what a lesson there is no
[58:16] season of his gracious surface of love
[58:19] unto our Lord but rather an increasing
[58:21] of it and that is the secret let the
[58:24] enemy attempt to thwart the service of
[58:27] the Lord and our reply his increased
[58:30] service and when we faint and are crying
[58:32] in fear that's the time to shout the
[58:36] victory
[58:37] hey that wonderful you know Paul wrote
[58:42] to us a lot of these words about
[58:46] tribulation work and patience Paul had
[58:50] an ambition to be a priest from the time
[58:53] he was a young boy he was groomed to be
[58:56] a priest yet a lot of zeal had a lot of
[58:59] potential it was tied up in the young
[59:01] man brother Branham said about from the
[59:04] age of 8 or 10 up to the time he was 35
[59:08] when he was finished with college and he
[59:10] said his mom and dad paid a great sum of
[59:13] money to put him through school and you
[59:16] can imagine how disappointed all of the
[59:19] priests were all of the educators his
[59:22] mother his father all of his friends and
[59:25] his circle how disappointed they were
[59:28] when they see Paul turned his back on
[59:31] all of it and looked at it as it was
[59:34] done because the pillar fire
[59:37] changed everything in Paul's life the
[59:41] Bible said Paul was an apostle of Jesus
[59:44] Christ by the will of God Paul never
[59:47] called himself God called Paul you find
[59:51] Paul turned his back on everything and
[59:54] immediately he began to preach Jesus as
[59:57] Christ but you know instead of being in
[1:00:01] with the up and ups being a fancy name
[1:00:04] and having clout and power everything
[1:00:08] God does it the opposite way he makes
[1:00:11] him a reject he makes him a preacher of
[1:00:14] heresy he makes him an outcast of
[1:00:17] society and so one day he casts a devil
[1:00:21] out of a woman who brought a lot of gain
[1:00:23] to the city and they they fell upon him
[1:00:26] and they wit Paul and Silas they threw
[1:00:29] him in prison the Bible said in the
[1:00:32] inner prison way down in the bowels of
[1:00:35] it brother Branham said in this place
[1:00:37] stinks with rats and disease they put
[1:00:40] him in stocks no doubt their ankles for
[1:00:43] sore it was dark it was musty
[1:00:46] it was godforsaken what a place for a
[1:00:51] preacher whose bats are burning from
[1:00:54] being whipped because he's trying to be
[1:00:56] true to God what a place for what we
[1:01:00] call the Bride of Christ who's trying he
[1:01:04] turned this back on the church he lost
[1:01:07] everything wasn't there enough then I
[1:01:10] left my career wasn't enough that I left
[1:01:14] everything and now my back has busted to
[1:01:18] pieces I've been stoned and I'm in this
[1:01:21] godforsaken place could have been in
[1:01:24] into the Marriott her some nice motel
[1:01:27] had I stayed with my plans
[1:01:31] now I'm way down here in the inner
[1:01:34] dungeons who stalks rats running over me
[1:01:37] brother Branham says something amazing
[1:01:39] he says not one complaint he said no not
[1:01:44] one complaint they were faithful to God
[1:01:48] in their condition not one word of
[1:01:52] murmur not one word of complaint
[1:01:55] how many would say help me Lord but
[1:01:57] rather imagined it Silas turned over
[1:02:02] grown at all and he hears a jingle of a
[1:02:06] chain and Paul said did you hear that
[1:02:09] Silas
[1:02:10] hear what that jingle he shakes it he
[1:02:15] shakes his chains there is power power
[1:02:18] wonder-working power hit the blood of
[1:02:24] the Lamb Silas says yea there is power
[1:02:28] they get up they can't stand up all the
[1:02:31] way they begin shaking their trains
[1:02:33] there is power wonder they didn't shut
[1:02:45] up
[1:02:46] Silas joined in with it there is power
[1:02:49] power wonder-working power imagine
[1:02:56] angels began to come down from heaven
[1:02:58] and circle that little church in the
[1:03:02] blood of Jesus and they're singing
[1:03:04] praises unto God and all the sudden the
[1:03:07] place begins to shake I want you to look
[1:03:11] at this miracle those walls did not come
[1:03:15] down on top of them those walls fell
[1:03:18] away from him and it took their stalks
[1:03:21] off of them and God said you're free to
[1:03:24] go if you want they would have been
[1:03:27] selfish they would have run but there
[1:03:29] was a soul in there that needed saving
[1:03:31] and the man was gonna kill himself they
[1:03:34] say you know what help yourself
[1:03:36] you nasty Roman you know that's a lot of
[1:03:39] the attitude today you know your you
[1:03:41] deserve Sodom let the fire fall not Paul
[1:03:44] his home man come in Triplette and he
[1:03:48] said do yourself no harm
[1:03:50] there's love for you thanks grace for
[1:03:54] you no matter what you've done God is
[1:03:59] reaching out what must they do to be
[1:04:01] saved he said believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:04:04] died in the house shall be saved but man
[1:04:10] should think of it their feet their
[1:04:13] hands their neck they were set free
[1:04:16] he said that heavy Roman prison never
[1:04:19] broke in on him all the shackles fell
[1:04:22] off see that's our God hold out faithful
[1:04:28] he said stay faithful in your call how
[1:04:36] many believe that they never doubted the
[1:04:39] word even in those conditions they
[1:04:42] remained faithful faithful means loyal
[1:04:46] means constant means devoted unwavering
[1:04:51] steadfast Paul said of the Jews five
[1:04:54] times received I forty stripes save one
[1:04:58] second Corinthians 11:25 thrice was i
[1:05:03] beaten with rods once I was stoned
[1:05:06] thrice I suffered shipwreck a night and
[1:05:10] a day I've been in the deep in
[1:05:12] journeyings often in paths of water in
[1:05:16] perils of robbers in perils of my own
[1:05:19] countrymen in perils by the heathen in
[1:05:22] pals in the city perils and the
[1:05:25] wilderness perils in the city perils
[1:05:27] among false brethren in weariness and
[1:05:30] painfulness in watchings often in hunger
[1:05:34] in thirst in fastings often in cold and
[1:05:39] nakedness beside those things that are
[1:05:42] without the burden of the church who
[1:05:47] want to sign out who wants to be a
[1:05:50] preacher the Bible said in Acts chapter
[1:05:53] 14 22 he came by and confirmed the souls
[1:05:57] of the disciples exhorting them to
[1:06:00] continue in the faith of persevere in
[1:06:02] the faith that we must through much
[1:06:05] tribulation enter the kingdom of God
[1:06:12] Paul knew how to wait on the Lord all
[1:06:17] that Paul and Ord and he's on a ship
[1:06:24] storm comes up it's being thrown all
[1:06:28] over the sea for 14 days no stars no
[1:06:34] moon the winds are howling the sails are
[1:06:37] tore things are out of control the Bible
[1:06:40] said salt Paul was cut down and the bow
[1:06:43] of the ship for a long time finally he
[1:06:47] comes out and says brother and you
[1:06:50] should have listened to me before we
[1:06:51] left read he said but the angel the Lord
[1:06:54] whose servant I am just spoke to me and
[1:06:58] said I must appear before Caesar I love
[1:07:03] it because and the whole ship has been
[1:07:05] tossed people are throwing up from
[1:07:08] seasickness and Paul said I must go
[1:07:11] before Caesar the winds are still
[1:07:13] howling the ship is still being tossed
[1:07:16] but Paul knew that God's work must come
[1:07:19] to pass people thrown up over the side
[1:07:24] of the ship and he said God is going to
[1:07:26] give the life of everyone on the ship
[1:07:29] finally just exactly the way God said it
[1:07:33] they come up to an island and there
[1:07:35] they're called down to the bone and he's
[1:07:38] gathering wood and a Viper comes out of
[1:07:40] bites Paul thanks No Paul didn't even
[1:07:52] recognize it
[1:07:53] his mind was so on that word he said I
[1:07:57] must go before Caesar
[1:07:59] whether it's poisonous whether it's a
[1:08:01] bear he could spend before machine
[1:08:04] because God said he must go before
[1:08:08] Caesar can you say man don't be afraid
[1:08:12] to stand on God's Word hallelujah
[1:08:17] hold fast the Bible tells us behold I
[1:08:21] come quickly hold fast to that which
[1:08:24] thou hast and let no man take your crown
[1:08:28] in other words God said hold fast to my
[1:08:32] word I'm gonna reward you on the day of
[1:08:36] the resurrection heroes are going to
[1:08:38] raise up out of the earth men that stood
[1:08:41] on God's work more than their own life
[1:08:43] God has a crown waiting for them which
[1:08:46] represents you will reign with me
[1:08:48] through the millennium and hold fast
[1:08:52] he said that promises to those who
[1:08:55] suffer with him on earth who endured
[1:08:57] patiently knowing that God the just
[1:09:00] judge would reward them they who gave up
[1:09:04] all for him committed all to him will
[1:09:07] sit down in his throne and share his
[1:09:10] glorious Kingdom oh we have a word for
[1:09:12] us it is hope fast that is persevere
[1:09:17] don't give up
[1:09:19] put on the whole armor of God and use
[1:09:22] every weapon every gift at our disposal
[1:09:25] and look ahead with joy because we're
[1:09:28] going to be crowned by him who is king
[1:09:32] of kings and Lord of lords brother
[1:09:36] Branham said that there is always a
[1:09:38] crowning time for the word of the aged
[1:09:42] you know Paul was a total rejected hated
[1:09:46] and so forth but brother Branham said
[1:09:49] Paul stayed true to God and demas
[1:09:52] forsake him for for second all men for
[1:09:55] cooking and brother madam said when God
[1:09:57] servant stays true to the word the world
[1:10:01] is gone to forsake you people are going
[1:10:04] to hate you when you stay true to the
[1:10:06] message that God gave you every true
[1:10:09] saint
[1:10:10] the Bible has been forsaken for standing
[1:10:12] by the word but they that wait upon the
[1:10:16] Lord they will renew their strength
[1:10:19] Elijah was rejected by his age to the
[1:10:25] place he thought he was the only one
[1:10:26] left but he stayed true to the message
[1:10:29] of his day
[1:10:31] Daniel stayed loyal to God
[1:10:34] Daniel stayed true to God in the time
[1:10:37] where everyone else was compromising all
[1:10:40] the preachers were compromising every
[1:10:43] all of his family members they all turn
[1:10:45] their backs on God but Daniel said I
[1:10:48] will not defile myself and he stayed
[1:10:52] true and you find God crowned him when
[1:10:55] he stayed loyal to God because there is
[1:10:58] a crowning time for believers who
[1:11:01] believe the Word of God how many believe
[1:11:04] that brother Branham said Paul when he
[1:11:08] walked down to the chopping block
[1:11:10] he must have faced off with Nero his
[1:11:14] head was cut off and he said the old
[1:11:17] Dungy place down there a hole in the
[1:11:19] wall he said he walked down there Little
[1:11:22] Creek back there slammed his body into
[1:11:24] it and he said Oh death where is thy
[1:11:28] sting o grave where is thy victory I
[1:11:32] fought a good fight and now there's a
[1:11:34] crown laid up for me not only me but
[1:11:38] those that loved his appearing stand
[1:11:42] truth to the message stand true to the
[1:11:46] coming of the Lord
[1:11:47] stand true to the Bible stand true to
[1:11:50] the blood they gave her children's to
[1:11:55] true and their crowning day came Moses
[1:11:59] stood true to the Word of God and his
[1:12:02] crowning they came the Bible tells us in
[1:12:06] revelations chapter 19 13 and the Lord
[1:12:10] was coming in in the third coming he was
[1:12:13] clothed with a vesture dipped in blood
[1:12:17] his name is called the word of God verse
[1:12:22] 14 and the armies which were in heaven
[1:12:25] followed him the word on white horses
[1:12:30] fine linen white and clean
[1:12:33] see these followers here are the
[1:12:37] overcomers that stood for the word in
[1:12:39] their day and notice this the word is
[1:12:43] coming back to the earth and the
[1:12:46] followers are the followers of the word
[1:12:49] and in Revelation 17:14 his said and
[1:12:54] they that are with him are called chosen
[1:12:57] and faithful because they are faithful
[1:13:01] to the Word of God they were chosen in
[1:13:04] their age and they are faithful to the
[1:13:07] message that God sent him how many are
[1:13:11] followers of the word you'll be
[1:13:14] following him into the Millenium you'll
[1:13:16] be following him through the city
[1:13:18] because you are a follower of the word
[1:13:21] and he that endures until the end shall
[1:13:25] be saved
[1:13:27] notice this now can I go just a little
[1:13:30] longer way back in the beginning when
[1:13:35] God traded Eden he made the birds and
[1:13:39] the paradises whose beautiful God placed
[1:13:44] his masterpiece the crowning of his
[1:13:46] creation in the garden brother branham
[1:13:51] said that Eve was actually only
[1:13:54] potentially Adams wife for Adam had
[1:13:58] never known or he says that in 1965 in
[1:14:00] the power of transformation just like
[1:14:02] Joseph was married to Mary but she was
[1:14:06] only potentially as he never knew her
[1:14:08] his wife Adam never knew his wife he
[1:14:12] said like the church now and I know he
[1:14:15] uses those types differently but in the
[1:14:18] spoken word is the original seed brother
[1:14:21] Branham said that Adams bride
[1:14:25] not wait because be fruitful and
[1:14:28] multiply was an oncoming promise to
[1:14:33] bring forth sons and their likeness and
[1:14:36] brother Branham said Adams bride could
[1:14:40] not wait and Eve direct quote if God in
[1:14:45] a hurry and took wisdom instead of the
[1:14:51] promise and brought forth a child of
[1:14:54] death a child of the beast and brother
[1:15:00] branham said like a man that would find
[1:15:02] his bride already pregnant that's what
[1:15:05] Christ found as the church started
[1:15:09] virgin on the day of Pentecost he said
[1:15:12] but it wasn't long till Roman Dogma was
[1:15:14] found in her and she was pregnant with
[1:15:17] the Crete's and darkness and teachings
[1:15:19] of men and brother branham said she went
[1:15:22] after wisdom and he said just like the
[1:15:26] church has gone after psychology and
[1:15:29] theology and mental reasoning man's
[1:15:33] thoughts he's gone after wisdom and
[1:15:36] brother Branham said Eve did not know it
[1:15:38] and neither do they know it they think
[1:15:41] they're right and she would not bring
[1:15:47] forth the word manifested and the
[1:15:51] churches would not receive the message
[1:15:53] of this day to make the words make flesh
[1:15:57] and Eve was defiled because she could
[1:16:00] not wait on God and she disbelieved the
[1:16:04] word and brother Branham said jehovah's
[1:16:07] wife did the same thing and was put away
[1:16:11] because she could not wait and christ's
[1:16:15] bride was put away in divorcement
[1:16:19] because she could not wait and he said
[1:16:22] the Pentecostals have done the same
[1:16:24] they he said but there is going to be a
[1:16:27] bride predestinated not to fall when
[1:16:32] Christ comes she'll be like the Virgin
[1:16:34] Mary who takes this message into her
[1:16:37] virgin womb that waits on his word and
[1:16:42] brother Branham said do not get ahead of
[1:16:46] the Lord because they produce isms they
[1:16:51] see promises they try to produce it in
[1:16:54] their own power in their own strength
[1:16:56] and it brings forth isms it brings forth
[1:17:00] chaos it brings forth death
[1:17:03] but this church is the womb of life just
[1:17:09] like there was one virgin and the
[1:17:12] prophecy of Isaiah went down through
[1:17:16] eight hundred years until it anchored in
[1:17:19] the womb of a virgin so has this message
[1:17:23] went down to the aegis until God found a
[1:17:28] church to anchor the message of the hour
[1:17:31] into her womb many of wit often isms had
[1:17:36] tried to produce the manifestation of
[1:17:39] the sons of God and many have tried to
[1:17:41] do it and it isn't produced Christ at
[1:17:45] all but brother Branham said this bride
[1:17:48] will bring forth the finished body of
[1:17:51] the Lord direct quote this bride will
[1:17:57] bring forth the finished body of the
[1:18:01] Lord in other words he cannot return
[1:18:03] until the body is complete and this is
[1:18:07] the hour for a bride without spot
[1:18:10] without wrinkle if we wait upon our
[1:18:14] lover brother Branham said remember
[1:18:18] let's remember why were obeying the
[1:18:22] spirit one great lesson we never want to
[1:18:26] be hasty if we ask God for anything God
[1:18:30] answers prayer and he does it in his
[1:18:33] time and he makes it work just right
[1:18:38] when they come into the land I will hold
[1:18:41] you much longer bear with me when Moses
[1:18:46] was commissioned to bring the church
[1:18:49] into the promise you find Moses was a
[1:18:53] type of denomination who glorified
[1:18:55] himself he said must we bring forth
[1:18:58] water out of this rock brother Branham
[1:19:01] said he broke every type in the Bible he
[1:19:04] was a lawgiver a type of denomination
[1:19:06] that cannot bring the people into the
[1:19:09] promise so God turned the mantle over to
[1:19:13] Joshua as I was with Joshua so will I be
[1:19:16] with thee so Joshua now a type of the
[1:19:19] Holy Spirit is going to pack the people
[1:19:22] into the land of promise and a notices
[1:19:25] now Joshua was always waiting on the
[1:19:29] next move from God so brother Branham
[1:19:32] said Joshua comes down to Jordan and
[1:19:34] this is the age of Jordan crossing over
[1:19:37] into the land where every promises made
[1:19:40] manifest all that Adam lost is in this
[1:19:43] land every power of God is in this land
[1:19:47] healing is in this land joyous in this
[1:19:50] land
[1:19:51] peace is in this land he turn a life is
[1:19:54] in this land her new body is in this
[1:19:56] land that's where this message is to
[1:20:01] take us so Joshua comes down and he sees
[1:20:06] the Jordan River it's swollen it's the
[1:20:09] worst time to cross over brother random
[1:20:12] said Joshua's engineers could have said
[1:20:14] we've made a lot of bricks we've made a
[1:20:15] lot of walls we know all about it and
[1:20:18] there's no way we we understand weights
[1:20:21] and volumes and so forth there's no way
[1:20:24] to get across this river why don't we
[1:20:26] wait just just a couple months and this
[1:20:29] thing will be crossing as we could go
[1:20:31] right over top of it and Joshua said but
[1:20:34] God said three days we're not
[1:20:37] compromising three days in three days
[1:20:40] we're going over but Joshua shut up but
[1:20:43] but Joshua did you shout yes sir
[1:20:47] three days he said sanctify yourselves
[1:20:50] get ready we're crossing over none of us
[1:20:53] can swim Joshua everyone of us was born
[1:20:58] in the wilderness and there's no water
[1:21:00] out there none of us could swim but you
[1:21:05] know what he said he said he put the
[1:21:06] word in front of them he said that's
[1:21:10] exactly the position where the word was
[1:21:12] supposed to be and he said he didn't put
[1:21:15] the preachers in front of him he put the
[1:21:17] word in front that's what brother
[1:21:18] Branham said he said yes it was carried
[1:21:21] over the hearts of the Levites but it
[1:21:22] was the word that was going in front and
[1:21:26] so as they touched the water the waters
[1:21:29] just moved back and as the waters moved
[1:21:33] back and they waited upon the Lord they
[1:21:36] all crossed over on dry land ain't that
[1:21:39] wonderful brother Branham said but the
[1:21:41] one thing is do not get ahead of the
[1:21:45] word I don't care what you think in
[1:21:47] three days we're going over and he said
[1:21:51] the trouble is as we try to get ahead of
[1:21:53] the word we bypassed the word to make it
[1:21:55] fit this and to make it work fit that
[1:21:57] but the word led the way and when it got
[1:22:01] to Jordan she opened up and they went
[1:22:03] over let the word do it and notice every
[1:22:07] campaign they fought they put the word
[1:22:10] in front of the fight how many say help
[1:22:13] me Lord put the word always in every
[1:22:16] trial in every battle every family
[1:22:19] circumstance let me take this word and
[1:22:22] keep it in front of me you'll come out
[1:22:24] victorious and then brother Branham said
[1:22:28] now and pick up your pen and write
[1:22:30] notice the harmony of the father and the
[1:22:33] son the son did nothing but what the
[1:22:34] father showed him the bride has a
[1:22:37] specific work to do at a specific time
[1:22:41] and brother Branham said let us stand
[1:22:43] like Joshua and Caleb because God did
[1:22:47] not let Israel go over until an
[1:22:50] appointed time and he said that there
[1:22:53] were people that were like Joshua you've
[1:22:55] lost your commission we ought to go all
[1:22:57] and the land is ours and he said same
[1:23:00] pressures same problems that this would
[1:23:03] be repeated in the last day he said but
[1:23:06] whatever you do don't be pressured stay
[1:23:09] behind the word can you say man and he
[1:23:13] said now caleb represented those who
[1:23:16] stayed true to joshua how many want to
[1:23:20] stay true to the word now watch this
[1:23:22] watch this now they win over everyone
[1:23:27] and they took the land without a scratch
[1:23:31] because they let the message of the hour
[1:23:33] go before him they were able to wait on
[1:23:38] God God has sent us a message this
[1:23:43] message is to forerun the second coming
[1:23:45] of Christ Christ will come in a physical
[1:23:49] body and many have tried to produce
[1:23:53] revivals and many have tried to produce
[1:23:55] God manifested in his fullness in his
[1:23:58] people
[1:24:00] it's caused all kinds of different isms
[1:24:03] that are different as the East is from
[1:24:04] the West
[1:24:05] but our job as lambs is to be faithful
[1:24:10] our jobs as lambs is to wait for God to
[1:24:15] fulfill his word and to believe his word
[1:24:20] brother Branham I'm going to bring this
[1:24:23] to a close brother Branham tells the
[1:24:26] story in the sixth seal of a ranchers
[1:24:31] great ranch from Chicago he owned
[1:24:34] ranches out in the west to Colorado he
[1:24:38] had a son miss sunny he was wanting him
[1:24:43] a wife but all the city girls of Chicago
[1:24:48] he said they like to party he couldn't
[1:24:51] find the character and the virtue that
[1:24:53] he was looking for someone who'd make
[1:24:56] him a wife someone that would care about
[1:24:59] him so he went out west up to Colorado I
[1:25:05] believe it was and all the he there was
[1:25:09] a a know
[1:25:10] ranch not an owner but a ranch caretaker
[1:25:13] had five daughters they all heard the
[1:25:16] rancher son was coming brother venom
[1:25:19] said these girls they were like kind of
[1:25:21] T Annie
[1:25:22] doing her hair up and their eyelashes up
[1:25:25] they were all one he used the word
[1:25:28] ramping they all learned to vamp a Missa
[1:25:30] they knew he was coming he was single
[1:25:32] rich and powerful and handsome they were
[1:25:36] all excited he said but there was a
[1:25:39] little orphan girl lost her mom and her
[1:25:43] daddy and she come to live with her
[1:25:44] uncle and she wasn't accepted she was an
[1:25:47] outcast among those arrogant little
[1:25:50] cousins and he said that they she had to
[1:25:55] do the dishes and she was treated like a
[1:25:59] slave not like an equal and he said she
[1:26:03] worked real hard and she missed her mom
[1:26:07] and she missed her daddy and she was
[1:26:09] stuck in these conditions when this man
[1:26:14] came to town brother branham said they
[1:26:15] put on their best they threw a party
[1:26:18] like you never saw the music was going
[1:26:21] and the honky-tonks were gone they were
[1:26:24] shooting their guns and flirting and
[1:26:26] dancing and hold-down and boy they're
[1:26:29] having themselves a party the man said
[1:26:34] these girls are just like the ones in
[1:26:36] Chicago he said after about three days
[1:26:40] of a hoedown and a big time he stepped
[1:26:43] down and he looked over the corral and
[1:26:46] he said Here Come this little Walsh girl
[1:26:48] he said she come out and she threw the
[1:26:51] water out she's barefoot ragged and he
[1:26:54] looks at her and something said on the
[1:26:57] inside he preaches this on second coming
[1:26:59] of the Lord as well he said he looks at
[1:27:01] her and said that's her you know how
[1:27:05] some people not everyone but some people
[1:27:07] look don't ever
[1:27:08] pre-conceived that in your mind you
[1:27:10] might mess make a big mess up but some
[1:27:12] people look up and say that's her well
[1:27:14] it worked for him and this time he said
[1:27:16] that's her boy his interest wasn't in
[1:27:21] the party house anymore he'd come out
[1:27:23] after tonight he'd watch her for a
[1:27:25] little bit he noticed she was faithful
[1:27:27] she was working hard he said one day I'm
[1:27:33] gonna get down there and I'm gonna talk
[1:27:34] to her one night he finally timed her
[1:27:38] and he knew how to get down there he
[1:27:40] made sure he was in the right place at
[1:27:41] the right time
[1:27:43] she went to throw the water and there he
[1:27:45] stands oh excuse me she puts her head
