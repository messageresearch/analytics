young people but all of us and if we've had a bad week or a bad month or we've been struggling he wants to make us feel like we can't praise because that would be hypocritical but that's not the truth what he recognizes is that your praise is a weapon and he will try to hinder you from using that weapon and breaking forth in Praise anytime you're struggling break out your praise raise up that standard Don't Be Afraid don't don't be shy about it your God will receive it amen amen we thank you for coming out on this Friday evening thank you musicians appreciate it and the support means the world to us we we're super thankful for all the adults that come to support the youth tonight and and more importantly we're happy that he promised to be with us amen he said we're two or three are gathered and before we get straight into it before we go there are a couple of quick announcements I'd like to make before we read the word um they have a wedding shower here tomorrow so the fellowship hall is already decorated and that's why we made the announcement that the after fellowship and refreshments will all be at the Burns's home they everything is there they're there now setting up everyone that is here is welcome it's not just for the young people Everyone is invited to brother Jackson and sister Laura's home after we're done here for refreshments and fellowship and also one other announcement I wanted to make is there will be youth services in Dallas on Labor Day weekend September 1st through the 3rd uh brother Danny steaman will be speaking there these are the times of the services if if you're interested in going just reach out to brother Matt McGarry or one there about lodging if you need help reaching out to him I'll be glad to put you in touch so that's our announcements we just want to turn our attention now to to the church age study but let's let's start with with prayer father we love you and we thank you Lord for your goodness Lord for these youths Lord and all that are gathered here tonight Lord that have a hunger for you and a hunger for your word that so many things are going on in the world tonight on this Friday night maybe riotus living and different things parties and and things of the world and yet here's a group that said I want to hear from the Lord tonight Lord I thank you for that hunger and that desire because your word tells us that those that hunger and thirst shall be filled so Lord we come with that promise in Our Minds tonight knowing Lord that as we look at this it's not just history Lord but it's your word spoken Lord down through each and every age I pray you'll reveal it to us you'll open it up to us Lord that it'll speak to the hearts of your children tonight in the name of Jesus we pray amen amen if you do happen to have your Bibles with you tonight we're going to turn to the Book of Revelation 2 and we're going to read verses 8 through 11 Revelation 2 8 through 11 and I want to reiterate what I've reiterated all along is that these Church age studies really are just supposed to be something extra to go along with your reading our desire is that you are reading the church age book yourself and I know life's busy I know we have a lot of things to do but we're doing these once a month and only covering about 20 pages I don't think it's too much to ask to get through 20 pages in a month hopefully that's doable so we've kind of spread it out that way and hopefully it's allowed you to keep up and do the reading and then what we're doing is just trying to break it down and open it so the Lord can open it up to you so maybe you can have a greater understanding of what you're reading and as we as we read here and we go into this understand that these things are historical fact it is history but don't look at it just as history understand that that the devil never does away with those Spirits the spirits that attacked in these ages it may come in different forms but those same spirits still attack today the same thing still come against people today and so as you read the church age book as we talk about these things and you recognize those spirits and how they operated you can apply it even to today and how they're coming against the church today and how they're attacking in This Day verse 8 says and unto the angel of the church in Smyrna right these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive I Know Thy works and tribulation and poverty but Thou Art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan fear none of those things which thou shall suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried you shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a Crown of Life he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death amen I pray the Lord will add his Blessing to the reading as you have your seats this evening so we're going into this morning age or the or the second age the second of the seven and one thing we've learned about as we've gone down Through the Ages is a scriptural pattern and how brother Branham talked about there's a scriptural pattern that you can use to determine who who the messenger in each age was and he says using a history as our source we can find what men in each age were the closest to the original pattern and we know that we learned in the first age that the original pattern the original messenger was Apostle Paul and we learned that every messenger from that time on would be the ones at the most closely resembled the Apostle Paul and their teachings and in their beliefs in the way the spirit would move and things of that nature he is the pattern and so brother Branham says you we can use the histories to examine the ministries of those that God used to restore truth in other words it wouldn't just be one in each age that was preaching truth he says you use the pattern to examine all the ministries of those that God is using to restore restore truth he says and then out of those there would be one for every age who would stand out the clearest as the closest in word pattern and power that one would be the messenger now notice he doesn't just say in word pattern he says word pattern and Power there's things that you're going to have in every age where there's got to be a word pattern and power and that goes not only for the messenger but for the True Vine which ones when you look at the churches not only line up in word but also in power which church most closely resembles the one on the day of Pentecost in word and power and one thing the spirit likes to come in and do today that the spirit of the false Vine is try to get you to focus on just one of them the word or come in and just focus on the power we don't want to lean too heavy on either one of them you got to have two wings to fly is that right we got to have the word and we got to have the power and he says that one would be the messenger so not only can we find The Messengers in history but we also find the ages themselves down through history God would foretell in Revelation like we just read that was him foretelling about the Smyrna age he would foretell of each age in Revelation and he would tell us the condition of that age and since God cannot lie we know that to be the truth God cannot lie his word is the truth then what you will find is that the history of those ages will match up perfectly with the Bible description of that age you read in the Book of Revelation and describes an age and then go study the history of that age and it will match up perfectly because this is a prophecy God's saying this is how it's going to be and since he cannot lie it matches up perfectly brother Branham says it is that simple but then Simplicity is the key to the word now hear that sometimes oh it's so deep it's so this that brother Branham says Simplicity is the key to the word and so as we go through that we want to keep that in mind it is simplistic there is a pattern which one is it and as brother Branham looks through this he says using our god-given rule of choosing the messenger for each Age We unhesitatingly declare that irenius was exalted by the Lord to that position I'm so thankful tonight to know that that we can declare truth unhesitatingly this isn't something that we're guessing about this isn't something that well maybe this is true maybe this is right they talk about in the scripture as looking at it through a glass Darkly age after age after age people didn't know and they guessed and they probed and that was okay they were searching for truth but in this day a message came that made it to a weekend declare truth unhesitatingly it isn't guesswork it isn't I think this should be we have a restored truth it is a clear glass you're looking through it looking at it right in the face I think it's awesome that today we're studying about ages past and their Messengers and it's all and it's all possible because we have recognized and received the message in this day why can we even study that the ages past because of the message today why can we study what went on in that day and who the messenger was and what the condition was we wouldn't be able to do that but today there was a message today there was a messenger and because you've recognized your day and your message you can look back at the truths of past ages amen irenius was a disciple of one known as as polycarp and polycarp was actually a student of John the Revelator John that wrote the Book of Revelation and and polycarp himself was a great warrior of the faith and he even gave his life as a martyr the histories would declare that when irenius was led to the state to be burned he told them don't tie me to the stake leave my hands Unbound and he stood there Unbound and as they lit the Flames the fires rose up all around him but instead of coming and burning him it said the Flames all turned and went the other way they bent away from him and the Flames wouldn't touch him and then they became so irritated and angry about it that they ran up and actually stabbed him with a sword and when they did water gushed forth from his body and put out all the Flames that had been lit this man was a great Saint he was a great witness of the gospel and he was Gallant he was a Christian but brother Branham says it couldn't be polycarp he couldn't be the messenger because he actually leaned towards organization he wasn't brother Branham uses the term militant against it he actually leaned towards organization and so because of this he says he looks further he says irenius was militant against any form of organization he says Irene is stood solidly for a unified Spirit-filled gift manifesting local church and God honored him for the power of God manifested among the saints I love that God honored him because he stood for let's hear it again he stood for unified Spirit-filled gift manifested local church and God honored him I say I hope God will honor Us in this day as somebody that stands for a unified Spirit-filled Gift manifesting Church that still says if God honored it then God will honor it now if that's what God was looking for then that's what God is looking for now and we ought to be a church that matches that amen he says his churches in France were known to have the gifts of the Spirit among them notice how he's choosing who the messenger is how he's notice how he's he's showing what the true vine is gifts of the Spirit among them for the Saints spoke in tongues prophesied raise the dead and healed the Sick by the prayer of faith if time were to tarry and I know we believe this is the last age but I hope that they could look back and say in that day there was a church an evening like Tabernacle where the Saints spoke in tongues the gifts of the Spirit manifested among them they prophesied raised the dead and healed the Sick by the prayer of faith because every time down through the church age book this is how he identifies the messenger and the True Vine the word and the power every single time he says thus with his strict adherence to the word his wonderful understanding of scripture and so there's the word part and the attendance of the power of God upon that Ministry he is the right choice for the age so irenius is the right choice for the age of Smyrna now here I listed it once again we have all seven of the churches there that were in Asia Minor but we're talking about Smyrna if you'll look at it it's just north of Ephesus straight south from pergamum and you can see it's right there in a very nice Port protected from the weather tucked in and because of that it was known for its exports it was located you know right there on the sea in a nice Port it was known for its main expert of myrrh which was a bitter herb used in embalming and using embalming and it was also bitter myrrh was very very bitter as we said in its name Smyrna actually comes from myrrh and so therefore the the the age means bitter here you see pictures of it today it was known for its schools of rhetoric philosophy Medicine Science architecture but the people there as advanced as they were in these worldly things the population there uh Smyrna was vehemently opposed to Christianity Smyrna as we said means bitter and brother Branham tells us that it was a bitter age filled with death and during this time the two vines that we've been speaking of since the very beginning the vines that we took all the way back to the Book of Genesis last time they began to drift further and further apart and it began to make the hatred and the bitterness towards the True Vine grow more and more the false Vine began to hate the True Vine with more passion and more Venom and it was also in this time even that the True Vine even though it was true it was experience a little bit of what brother Branham called paralysis he says for the True Vine began to drift further and further away from the unadulterated truths of Pentecost and see that's why even in this age that we had to have a restoration we had to have a restoration of truth because even the True Vine even though they were holding on to as much truth as they possibly could with each age it drifted a little bit further away and more Darkness came in and then a little bit further away and more Darkness came in and even though they were true the things that were lost down Through the Ages wasn't known to them even though they were holding on with all that they knew so much had been lost that there had to be a restoration in this day and in this age here this morning age organization was growing fast as man began to follow after Creeds they began to follow after the ideas of man and Holy Ghost leadership began to be pushed aside Holy Ghost leadership began to be done away with at a very rapid pace and man-made rituals now stood there in its place the salutation Revelation 2 and 8 and unto the angel of the church in Smyrna right these things saith the first and the last now notice which was dead and is alive we want to focus in on that little part there for just a second which was dead and is alive brother Branham keys in on this and he says it makes it very obvious that this isn't a mortal man that is speaking to the church here he says it makes it very obvious because not only does he say I am the first and the last but this very thing speaks of the Resurrection it speaks of the resurrection of Christ because the order of events of a regular human being would say I was alive but am now dead and they would have to be speaking from the grave but he says this one here is speaking of of a man that is resurrected it's speaking of deity because he says I once went into the grave I once was dead but now I'm Alive forevermore aren't you glad the day that we serve a risen savior that we're not serving a dead God it's not just a dead religion but he says I once was dead why was he dead for you why did he shed his blood for you but he didn't stay there he said no sir I'm going to rise again that I can send my spirit back that not only did I overcome but you can overcome by The Same Spirit that I overcame with I once was dead but now I'm alive and there's young people sitting here today that can say the exact same thing I once was dead but praise God because of that because of his Spirit coming back now I'm Alive forevermore amen so I went to the grave but now I'm alive so who are who's speaking this is the second Adam this is deity this is the one that's come the Lord Jesus to restore everything that Adam lost where Adam brought death this Adam brings life where Adam took a wonderful paradise and turned it into a Wilderness this Adam the second Adam comes and he's taking us back to Eden again this is the restorer of all things the fall may be sentenced us to death Adam's mistakes Adam's false sentences to death but by this Adam's death we have been granted eternal life and life forevermore amen this is deity speaking here in this age Mike can you come help me real quick please sir amen which was dead and is alive just making sure Mike's awake with us tonight no I'm kidding if you take the first stage the salutation from the first age and we're going back to what we studied last time he said these things say it he that holds the Seven Stars in his right hands now not to embarrass him put you on the spot but I just want to see we can do it as a group if you remember what did the Seven stars represent they were the seven very good they are the seven Messengers Seven Stars in his right hand it says and he walks in the midst of the churches and this showed us that he hasn't left the church alone he's walking through every age the the same Jesus that was there in the first age is with us in the last age and he's walking in the midst of his churches this is one in the same person and he's showing us that this is his church and he is in the midst of it but if we take that and we combine the salutation with the second age it would read like this these things saith he that holds the Seven Stars in his right hand and walks in the midst of the churches these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive this is the same person speaking to both ages and he's showing that he's in the midst of the second age just like he was in the midst of the first age and brother Brandon would say this is just like the seed that is in the midst of the fruit he said the seed that has the life in it is in the middle of the fruit and he said here the one with life in him is in the middle of the church he's there in the midst of the church bringing forth life Just Like a Shepherd watches over A Flock here is the chief Shepherd watching over his own it was his blood that paid the price and and that bought this church it was his blood that bought you and now he's the one who cares for his church and watches over his church why why is he so interested in you why is he so interested in the church because he paid a great price for it because he bought you because you were his and you belonged to him and he doesn't like it when a man or anybody comes in and tries to manhandle his church he doesn't like it when people come in and try to take control you know with with the great price that he paid with all that he gave for the church even though he knew and his foreknowledge is so great and perfect you know as he sees the church begin to to fall away and pull away it must be heartbreaking for him the ones that that he sent his Spirit back for on the day of Pentecost and now only an age later and they're beginning to reject that Spirit the very reason for the death burial and Resurrection so that that Spirit could come and end dwell men and now slowly they're starting to turn that down they're starting to turn away and go after other things just like Israel had always done throughout the Old Testament you know this has to to hurt him and it's and it's displeasing and hurtful falling away just as Israel always did but in every age he comes and introduces himself and makes himself known as deity each and every time and brother Brown says this is a dual purpose because it comes to comfort his church don't worry I'm deity I'm almighty God I'm walking with you I'm taking care of it I'm supplying your need but not only is it a comfort to the True Vine it is a warning to the false Vine I am God I am deeded deity don't think you're getting away with one thing everything you do to the True Vine will be recompensed everything will be paid back and poured out upon your head yes I'm here to comfort you but I'm here to warn the false Vine keep your hands off the True Vine I'm he's there it's it's a warning I am the one and true almighty God conditions of the age Revelation 2 and 9. it says I Know Thy Works in that tribulation and poverty but Thou Art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are of the synagogue of Satan this age is marked by tribulation he says I Know Thy works and thy tribulation and the Lord says I know once again there's a reference back to I'm in the midst of the church I'm not off somewhere not paying attention I know exactly what it is you're going through I know the blasphemy I know the tribulation I know and he constantly says I know but does he stop it does he stop the tribulation does he stop him from being thrown into prison does he stop him from being fed the Lions no he just says I know I know that's what's happening I know that's what's going on I'm not unaware and this is often something that people struggle with how can God be a loving God and Stand By and Watch all this suffering how can he claim to be a loving God and stand by and watch me going through what I'm going through and not do anything how come he didn't heal this one how come he didn't stop this trial how come you're letting this go on and and you see my pain you see my suffering and you see my death and then people even begin to say does God even love me look at all that I've gone through look at my pain look at my suffering look at my lonely nights look at my hurts does God even love me brother Branham said this quote comes right after he said people believe that God's love is like a parent protecting a baby that won't let anything happen to that baby he says but God said that his love was elective love the proof that God loves you or the proof of his love is election no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation it doesn't matter what happens to you today what happened to you yesterday or what you go through next week you have been chosen for salvation that is the proof of his Love This Love This Love of God doesn't mean no suffering but the proof of God stands in election he chose you he died for you he saved you therefore he loves you it doesn't matter what all you go through brother Branham says he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose at the end of the day this is the shortest amount of time you're going to live anywhere and the things that you go through here on this Earth as the word tells us they don't even they're not even worthy to be compared to the glory that awaits you they're not even worthy to be compared to the eternity that awaits you let's stop taking every day little things or big things whatever it may be and saying does God love me when he was willing to leave all of heaven and come down and shed his blood that you could be with him forever there is no greater proof of God's love than his election on your life he says the last one ended with I want to go back to it ended with that I read he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose now listen close because we'll be here for just a second is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled Hebrews 5 8 9 says though he were a son now he's talking about Jesus the one that we say was the perfect one without sin perfect and it says though he were a son yet learned he obedience learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him what's he saying here the very character of Jesus Christ was perfected by suffering and yet we wonder why am I going through this Lord if Jesus Christ if his character had to be perfected by suffering you think you're going to get there with anything less he said his very character was perfected by suffering the things that we go through ART to break us but they are to mold us and make us into the image that he wants you to be in Paul suffered great things go read the life of Paul he goes through so many things over and over and over and over and then he says but nothing can separate me from the love of God job suffered Jesus suffered there's going to be suffering but it is with a purpose James 1 2 through 4 says my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations it's hard to do it is the worst day of my life thank you Lord this is awesome I have fallen short if that's how you're supposed to respond to it but it says count it all joy and then it says knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but he says it's not just to work patients there's more to it then let patients have her perfect work that ye may be perfect an entire wanting nothing why am I going through this why doesn't he step in and stop it because he has a vision of what you're going to be when you get through it on the other side there's something he's molding you into there's something he's making you into why does he stand by why do we suffer because it's for our molding that our character will come to a place that our character is fit to reign he doesn't just want you to remain down here forever he wants you to reign with him but in order to reign with him your character must be fit to Reign Romans 8 17-18 says and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us why do we suffer with him because he wants us to reign with him there is a purpose in it brother Brown says unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign when you're suffering when you're struggling when you're battling just recognize I'm gonna rain I'm gonna rain there's a purpose for this there's a purpose for this attack there's a purpose for this trial and the thing is to make sure that we find the purpose in our trial don't let the trial be meaningless and come out angry and bitter therefore you got to go through another trial to fix the anger in the bidder let the trial have its purpose let patience do its work let it serve its purpose let everything that I go through have its perfect perfect work that way it's not in vain I don't want to go through things in vain but I want to come through them as gold tried in the fire with all the imperfections and the things on the other side burn out of my life all the impurities and things worked out of my life amen there's a reason for the suffering because character is a victory prophet of God says the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering listen I know it can happen this is sort of a blanket statement but in general you find somebody that was raised with a silver spoon in their mouth given everything never had to work in a day in their life never went through anything raised up with everything just given giving giving giving giving and they usually have pretty terrible character because they never went through anything to allow that character to be developed in their life he wants to share his throne with you that's why first Peter 4 12 says beloved think it's not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you it's not strange that he wants you to reign with him and in order to get there you're going to have to overcome some things in order to Reign you must first overcome think about it how did Jesus get his throne how did he get his throne Revelation 3 21 says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame in him sat down with my father in his throne he got it by overcoming he says and I want you to sit on a throne and you're going to overcome in order to get that Throne you're gonna go through things you're gonna fight things you're gonna come up against things that you don't know how I'm gonna make it through how I'm gonna get through this you're going to have days where you think you're gonna quit but you're not you're going to push through you're going to battle through you're gonna come out as gold you're gonna come out perfected you're going to come out as the Bride of Jesus Christ because the marriage of the Lamb has come in his bride hath made herself ready and then you're going to sit down in his throne and reign with him God wants Christ like character and christ-like character comes through suffering and trials and none of us like to hear that but it's the truth and that's what brother Brown is doing here is he's placing this he says the church now listen to this this is good because we go through battles he says the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of God that's pretty straightforward Hebrews 12 and 6 says for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth Lord don't love me I'm going through this is no it's proof that he does whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth discouraging is not fun it hurts it's painful but if God loves you he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth don't let the devil come to you because it's something that he does to all of us and when you go through trial after trial and hardship after hardship he'll begin to come to you and say you've done things wrong that's why you're going through this you stumbled you messed up and so because of this God is punishing you and because of this you're going through that he loves to beat us up on that kind of stuff but Peter says no think it's not strange that you're going through these trials there's quit giving it so many quick you're thinking too much you're thinking about too much you're worrying about it too much God is using this trial to mold character that is worthy to rule church that's what I want I want to rule with him I want to live eternally with him I want to be in heaven with him so whatever I have to go through here Lord whatever it takes to get me ready for that I'm ready for it I'm ready to go through it I may not like it it may hurt I may not see it coming it may destroy this flesh but if that's what it takes to get me over there then I will take it Lord because I'm not worried about things here near as much as I'm worried about things there I want to be there I want my character right to be raptured I want my character right to grab a body change I want my character right that if I go by the way of the Grave I come up in a resurrection and whatever it takes Lord just let me be ready just let my character match your character brother Branham goes on and says right here the Cloudy Skies and storms of life are no sign of God's disapproval wow the devil sure won't tell you that he'll beat you all over the place with the trials and things you're going through he said it's not a sign of God's disapproval otherwise God was this disapproving of job think about that not only did God allow what happened to job God suggested it so it has nothing to do with his approval but then here's the other side don't get so caught up in people's success or your own success or your own perfect life because things can change like that because he says neither are bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved he approves you because he approved the sacrifice he approves you because he's looking at you through the blood he approves you because of election he says his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as Sons am I accepted yes you're accepted was it because I did this and after the Youth Camp I hadn't messed up for a month and I've been lip you're accepted because the sacrifice was accepted you're accepted because it's under the blood you're accepted because he loves you how do I know that he loves me because he because he said he did how do I know that it's all going to work out because he said it would but how do I know because his word declares it and in the heart of a believer that settles it look and I've heard a lot of testimonies from young and old Delight where people get to the place where they say things like I was wondering does God even love me listen if God never answers another one of your prayers if he turns his back on you today and never speaks to you again to where you can literally say like Jesus did why hath you forsaken me then you have no right even then to question his love for you he's done enough through election he's done enough in that he has saved you he's done enough and that he's coming for you he's done enough and that he's going to change your body and that you're going to overcome and you're going to sit on the throne with him we don't got to have something special every week every other day we ain't got to have voices rain down from heaven we ain't got to feel chills We Ain't Gotta Have Nothing although I sure love it when those things happen Lord speak to me right now and our voice from Heaven I want those things I want chills I know that's just a bump on yourself I like it I'm all about it I want to see rejoicing and Shout I want to feel him near but if he never does another thing for me I know he loves me I know he cares for me I know that I'm going to be there how do you know his word declares it he said it and that settles it he loves you amen see he knows what it is we need young people old people alike but we used to have this big debate every year when I would teach Civics to middle schoolers about needs and wants and I would put columns up there and say needs and wants and go up there and write things you need they never get it right let me tell you one that blows your mind none of us need a phone it's not a need none of us this is hard to say need a car because the definition of needs is essential to life food clothing shelter that's literally the only three needs there are physically anything else is they want now if you want a decent life with some comfortable then there's lots of things I want okay and there's nothing wrong with wants wants are fine but understand this God never said he was there to fulfill all your wants he's there to take care of your needs uh he's and he understands what it is we need more than we understand what we need so even though it seems harsh that God would stand there and look upon his children in a time of need and not just stop it he knows what you need more than you know what you need for your Eternal benefits we've covered this before but there's times where you look at the scripture Romans 8 28 and it says that all things work together for good and you have no idea how it's possible that this horrible thing that just happened or this trial or this run of bad luck is working out for your good but it's because we look at it through Earthly eyes and we're thinking about our Earthly good he isn't concerned about that when he says he's going to work it out for your goodies talking about eternally it is for your Eternal good it is working to make sure that no matter what happens here you make it there it is for your good brother Brown says see him walking up and down in the midst of his church like a father he is looking down upon his family and he's the provider and he's the protector and yet all this stuff's happening what kind of Provider what kind of protector he knows what they need not what they want brother Brown says these physical things are not the true basic necessities of your life for a man's life consisted consists not of the things he possesses a man's life hear this clear because if there's one thing that I I started to be too harsh let's not be too harsh if there's one thing that irks me that I have a hard time tolerating is materialistic people that gets so high and low off of material things your material things should never change the plane of your attitude or your joy or your happiness or your joy and your happiness is based in the wrong things but Aaron period that's not debatable if your material things affect your joy and happiness then your Treasures are not laid up in the right place that doesn't mean let me come back because some people can't balance it themselves that doesn't mean you can't have a horrible month and be down about it okay I'm talking about that you're not on a roller coaster of emotion all the time based off of material things sure if my car breaks down tomorrow I'm not gonna be excited yes I'm gonna wish that hadn't happened you understand what I'm saying but if it affects your joy to the point that you can't come to the house of God and worship and praise and look on things knowing he's going to take care of you because he's the provider then your trust and Faith and Hope and Joy's in the wrong place okay maybe that brought it a little clearer because it's not about material wealth and material things brother Brown says that God's people are not Material minded they're not Material reminded because they recognize that to be rich in the spirit and to be rich in the things of God is true treasure and true wealth he said it is not Material it is within us a rich man is rich in God not in worldly things so the spirit if we go back to our original scripture he's talking to me he says I see thy poverty and in parentheses he says but thou are rich one is material one is spiritual I see your poverty but you're rich now a carnal man might would choose the wrong one there but if I have to place myself in one of those two I say Lord I will be materially poor every day of my life as long as I can be rich in the spirit as long as I can have more of you as long as I know that my treasures are waiting for me in heaven as long as listen I don't want to be poor in the spirit I don't want to be poor and dried up and carnal and formal and have no Spirit about Lord I want you to pour it out on me I don't care about the material aspect now Lord if you want to give me a few things that's okay I'll take it but that's not where our focus is to be is to be rich spirit this in the spirit the spirit says I see what you were being put through I see that you have no possessions I see you're being made fun of I see you're being cast out but in spite of all that you are rich he says you have Treasures laid up in eternity you have Eternal Treasures that far exceed any material blessing you could ever have here on Earth because this stuff right here will burn but the victory of your character is eternal the victory of your character Will Roll On Through the Ages after ages after ages while everything you ever earned and worked for and built and accumulated burns your character will live on forever and ever and ever you make sure you're rich in the character of the Lord Jesus Christ synagogue of Satan brother Branham tells us to pay close attention to this verse not only just for the contents of it he says he says but also because it's repeated in another age over a thousand years later so it'll come back around he says Revelation 2 and 9. I know the blasphemy of him which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan now Jews here does not refer to the religion and for some reason I put the word but twice but but to the people of Judah in other words Jews by birth not Jews because of of the religion he tells us that there are people in this age that are claiming to be Jewish claiming to be Jews and yet they're Liars he says I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not he says they're Liars they're not Jews they're not Jews by birth brother Branham says and they're not Jews by religion he says they are the synagogue of Satan so who are they why would they lie about being a Jew well one thing we know is that the early the early church was consisted mainly of of Jews we know that the the false Vine we know that the the false Vine we know that they are of the false Vine because that brother Branham says they are the synagogue of Satan but why lie what do they gain and as I said because the early church was mostly Jews Jews were the original members the apostles were Jews so why are they lying about being Jews because it gives them Prestige because it connects them to the original they don't want the original life they don't want that Holy Ghost coming in and changing them and making them all act fanatical but they want to tie themselves in claim to be the original and so they claim to be Jews it's the exact same tactic brother Brown says that the Catholic Church would use tell a lie and stick to it no matter what the history book says no matter if if people know it's not true just claim we're the original we're the original we're the original and just repeat that lie over and over and over and stick to it they claim that to have the keys to the kingdom because Peter was the first pope they claim to be the mouse piece of mouth peace of God and he says I know the blasphemy I know what they claim and they are not I know what they're claiming to be but they're not he says he says it here again I know the blasphemy of them would say they are Jews and are not but are of the synagogue of Satan so what we see in this age is the Antichrist spirit is growing and we've been following that false Vine all the way back since the garden but now this same group that claims to be to be of the Jews the false Vine is infiltrating it's granting more hold in the church and it's claiming to be the original is claiming to be Jews but God says you're Liars and they're seeking the the they're seeking the power and The Prestige of the church they want that power but they don't have any desire for the life they want the prestige but they don't want to change they don't want the spirit of Christ in this spirit this false Vine begins to inch its way in and it came in by the Deeds of the Nicolaitans but now it's no longer hiding now it's no longer so subtle now that they've come out and they've gotten bold and brother Brown says they've begun to organize in this age and they're standing there in the face of the True Vine look in the truth in the eyes and saying we're the truth we're the original we're the ones your Heretics your man followers that's a cult and they stand there with all their false Traditions with all their false doctrines and they point out the true and call it the false and it's no longer hidden but it's right there in the open openly defying the True Vine but don't think now I know we're studying the church ages and we begin to talk about the false Vine but that doesn't didn't just start in the church ages we took that all the way back to the Garden the Antichrist Spirit has been here all along we saw it in in the children of Israel as it manifested itself in the wilderness because the Antichrist Spirit Wars against God it tries to take over the church brother Branham says here just as the early church started out under the pure Ministry now notice we're going to go back to where we started every time that he points to the True Vine he takes it back to Pentecost he says just as the early church started out under the pure Ministry of the Holy Spirit with its pure Ministry of the Holy Spirit what's going to follow it with signs and wonders and manifestations such as prophecy tongues and interpretation wisdom knowledge and healing so in the days of Israel when they left Egypt they were under the leadership of the spirit of God manifesting in gifts now notice what this is this is what you see when God is the leader of a church right here when there's Holy Spirit leadership this is what you see this is how a church moves that isn't bound down by man-made ideas and Creeds and dogmas listen Israel had just been freed from bondage and that's how it operated they had just come out from underneath the nomination and that's how they operated they operated in Freedom just as the first church did in the book of Acts while they were yet still free and notice anything that takes this away or try to minimize it is trying to return you to bondage think about it even on the journey in the wilderness what they say let's let's captain return to Egypt Egypt so make note this may sound harsh but there are those who will come out under the ministry of the prophet and will follow the pillar of fire for so long and then they will come to a place that they say let's go back and they may not say it boldly like that but they'll say we don't need that stuff anymore we don't need the freedom anymore well if you don't want freedom what is it you're asking for you're asking for the bondage of Egypt we don't need the moving of the spirit we don't need your dance Miriam we don't need the tongues and interpretation we don't need the freedom to worship those things are in the past all we need is the word all we need is the word and let's make a captain and go back to where there wasn't freedom I say we will never go back we can't go back we come too far to turn back I will have freedom of worship in the house of God I will have the moving of the spirit I will have lives set free we've come too far to go back now I choose to stay free I choose to stay out from underneath bondage I choose to err on the power side I'm not going back to that but there will be those that want to go back brother branham's talking here about Israel because Satan hates Liberty he hates your Liberty he hates your freedom and he hates the Holy Spirit leadership and he's always going to try to assert the leadership and authority of man into the church and he's talking here about Israel how they begin to notice that other nations had Kings Mike he says it caught their eyes and they decided they ought to humanize their leadership now this quote was very powerful to me so they wanted a king now God was going to humanize the leadership himself in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ but they got ahead of him how many times do we have a desire that isn't necessarily a wrong desire but we get out in front of God we can't wait on the timing of God and we want it now and it's got to happen now but you don't understand it's got to happen now and he's got it waiting on you he's got it waiting on you but you just need to sit back and relax into him and let him lead let him take you look you you learned through trials there's times where sick I want to be healed now and he's going I've got that taken care of just keep walking well I'm getting old I want to get married now he's got it taken care of just keep walking because the last thing you want to do is get out in front of him and do something that you ain't supposed to do you'd be way better off waiting and doing what he wants he says Satan knew the plan of God so he put it in the hearts of the people to get ahead of God or the word like I said that struck me God was going to humanize the leadership himself but they got ahead of God and I just want to encourage you let God move don't force God to move sometimes we get in a hurry just let God have his way even even in the services we have be EP you know I you're not guilty I've been guilty of before sitting through the majority of a service and having thoughts like dead in here instead of having thoughts like Lord you said you'd be here where two or three are gathered Lord why ain't this happening yet something Lord you said you'd be here and we begin to try to force things to happen just worship God just worshiping let God move how he wants to move and then there's times you're sitting there thinking it's dead next thing you know right at the end of service also there's some great out I have had to repent sometimes I might be too real with y'all but I believe in being transparent Micah in here Now's the Time there have been times where I was standing back there going Mike it's time to go not out loud in my heart or Timothy whoever it is time ain't nothing happening it's time you're saying they're going man you can feel it anybody can feel it it's time to and then he moves and there's people at the altar and there's deliverance and if my carnality had had my way that wouldn't happen get out of God's way and let him operate let him move when he wants to move how he wants to move through whom he wants to move through but they began to say we want to do it the way other people are doing it we want a king who is one of us to lead us and Samuel feels terrible about this because he's the prophet and God says to him listen Samuel they haven't rejected you they've rejected me and when people are like we don't want that stuff in our church God says it's okay they're not rejecting you they're rejecting me they're rejecting me because they're giving in to the rulership of a man their own flesh see sometimes we think about the rulership of man we're putting it off on other people coming in and ruling no when you allow your flesh to rule that's the rulership of a man and so they let the rulership of a man rule in what they think and what they want and what's comfortable to them and how they think it should operate and he says they're rejecting me so they wanted a king to lead them into battle here they are asking God to let them be like the rest of the Nations let us be like them and not recognizing that the whole point of Israel is that they were his people the whole point of Israel is that you're not them even like Tabernacle the whole point is we're not like the world quit trying to be like the world quit saying that one's cool and that's cool no I like how that looks and why can't we and why can't we because you're not them you're not called to be them the whole point of it is be ye separate saith the Lord that's the point of all this they are called out people for his name but they wanted to be like the world not recognizing they were different from the world on purpose they were not of the world on purpose so don't look like the world listen you can't look like the world act like the world talk like the world feet on what the world feeds on and then say they're going to hell You misspelled they it spelled why oh you apostrophe r e if you're eating and feeding and living just like them what makes you think you're going somewhere they're not the difference is though you're called to be separate now don't let that come and beat you over the head we all go through things man I went many many many many years looking acting talking like the world but there was a seed on the inside of me just like there is on the inside of you and when that light hits and that and that seed begins to Quicken there ain't nothing that'll that'll hold you in the world anymore there ain't nothing for you to go back to the the ships are burned there's no reason to go back you've been quick into life so if we're quick into life let's look like it let's act like it let's talk like it let's worship like it like we're quick into something different we can never forget that we're called to be separate what makes the difference brother Aaron let's read this first this is this is what we're called to First Corinth second Corinthians 6 17 18. wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord and touch not the unclean things don't touch what they touch and I will receive you and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty what makes the difference brother Brown would say put God to one side and Israel was like any other Nation when Samson cut off his hair he was like any other man put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it oh my let's not be that let's not just be another church with message attached to it may we never get to the place that we can do it without his spirit that we can do it like everybody else can do it he says the world and the church are all of the same lump just like eat Jacob and Esau were of the same parents but the spirit of God makes the difference well I promise you I'm gonna welcome it I'm not going to reject the one thing that makes the difference if it's the spirit that makes the difference I say let the spirit have preeminence if it's the spirit that makes a difference I say Lord pour out your spirit tonight and the next time we're together in every day of my life I want what makes the difference if we're of the same look what makes a difference in heaven and hell the spirit brother Branham says it's the holy ghost or perish Lord we gotta have it Lord we accept it we will not reject it we will not turn it down the word of God says that's what makes the difference then we've got to have it we got to be desperate for it we gotta call for it we gotta want it then when it moves however it moves we got to accept it church that's why we preach it that's why we believe for that's why we welcome it that's why we long for more of it we don't just call ourselves Christians we're born of the very spirit of God we don't just call ourselves that to us it is the Holy Ghost or perish the Nicolaitans had gotten in the church began to drift well how much did they drift brother Aaron doesn't matter it doesn't matter because Hey Brother Brown says they drifted away from the pattern of the word and then he says Eve drifted one word off it only takes one word the serpent just changed one word and he believed it but more and more things began to drift in that were not in the original pattern listen it doesn't matter how good it is how sound it seems how awesome it may send to these ears if it's not in the original pattern we don't want it but he says more things began to come in that were not of the original pattern he says that not only will it affect this age but it's going to affect every age actor because of what they let in they begin to hate and fight the True Vine and he says notice how organization breeds hatred it destroys Fellowship it makes bitterness more and more things were coming in a root of bitterness began to grow in the false Vine towards the True Vine why what did they do wrong what did Abel do wrong except be accepted and the false Vine hates the acceptance of the True Vine and it causes bitterness to begin to grow and hatred began to magnify more and more than it was ever before he said the smyrnian church drifted away from far from the original it had become a hybrid it had hybridized itself the way Eve did and what this means is it was no longer pure it was mixed it was the word of God partial mixed with the ideas of man and then the church had began to mix in Creeds and mix in ideas of those that were not her husband the Lord Jesus and that's why he Compares it to Eve he says instead of the straight word of God instead of Spirit-filled men in the church who were led by the spirit given Revelation Spirit given Revelation there are now Creeds and bylaws and the educated guesses of educated men learning has taken the place of Revelation reason has replaced Faith program has replaced spontaneous praise in the Holy Ghost it wasn't so from the beginning oh my if we read this here we can say it like this in the beginning the church was spirit-led in the original it was not educated into you it wasn't fine lectures with some little bit of two songs here and then two songs after and then let's go home and say we did our duty he says it replaced spontaneous praise in the Holy Ghost listen I love spontaneous praise I love spontaneous worship we're just all of a sudden all of a sudden I don't care if it's the beginning of a song or something all of a sudden it's like this and all of a sudden whoa and it's spontaneous I say let's keep it original I say let's keep it spontaneous let's keep it the way it was on the day of Pentecost it wasn't some workup where they sang One song long enough till finally somebody got a side all of a sudden Pillar of Fire came in there and it was spontaneous and it combusted and it blew apart listen I want it in this church to where we don't know when we don't know who we don't know how but at any moment spontaneous praise can break out across this congregation I say let's keep it that way let's keep it free I don't care who shouts I don't care who gets free just let it be spontaneous praise in the Holy Spirit because the other wasn't so from the beginning that's not how it was the hybrid hates the truth and because of this the true begins to be pushed out they began to be pushed out of the organizations pushed out of the churches the true were poor they were outcast but they were rich in the spirit and they would worship wherever the spirit was given Liberty that's how it is today the true will worship where the spirit is given Liberty Street Corners caves storefronts it didn't matter where but the bitterness was growing and brother Branham says that for all the good the people of God do they are still put to public shame and death surely there must be some Sinister force behind a people who would be so void of conscious that they would return evil to those who did them good what would drive somebody to kill and to persecute those that only wanted to speak truth to kill and persecute those that are doing good in the community to kill and persecute those that whose lives had been changed for the better they had a testimony of living right and it would be the same thing as we said that drove Cain to kill Abel it's Satan it's Satan back behind this group pushing it's safe in that so against the True Vine it's Satan that's doing these things although it's manifested in the lives of people it's no different than they're in the Book of Genesis where he says when he says that that thy seed you know that would see the woman will crush the head of the serpent and and not see shall bruise his heel what Calvary did was there a bunch of snakes there trying to bite Jesus no but it was manifested in people it was an anointing of Satan and it's Satan that's driving this persecution and brother Branham makes such an awesome comparison here and we'll get to it in just a minute hybrid religion is death and we're about to be wrapping this up in just a minute but I want to focus on that we just said it it don't matter how good it is young people If It Don't Fit the original pattern do away with it don't mix it in because a hybrid cannot produce original Christians that's why when you ask somebody are you a Christian they'll respond with I'm a Baptist or I'm a Methodist instead of yes I'm a Christian because there's something mixed in that makes them a Baptist or makes them a Methodist there's something there that's been hybrid the life that brings Christians forth isn't there to bring forth Christians it can only produce what it is listen to mule brother Brown talks about it is a hybrid it's a mix between a horse and a donkey and it can never reproduce and neither can a church that is mixed with Creeds and dogmas and the ideas of man ever mixed with truth even bring forth original Christians it can't it can't bring forth original Christians he says when the church allowed herself to move away from the original like Adam and Eve then death set in brother Brown says there's no strength in her she's become a monstrosity the minute the church moved towards form and ceremony and towards priesthood by organization the minister the organization that ministers into a group that decided leadership apart from the holy spirit in his word that very moment death entered in and she started to get sick and as she got sick she changed to a powerless group of people whose only weapon was argument don't get to the place where you can out quote people and out argue people but there's no life there I don't care if you know one verse or one quote if you got that Holy Ghost burned on the inside of you you better off than some educated Theologian in the message there was a time where it wasn't about you know it wasn't so from the beginning that we got up and just gave pretty lectures and became educated in the message but there was a life that was birthed into people that's what we're longing for that's what we're not just a people with an argument not just people that well I can show you in the scripture this and I can show you that let your life testify to the world let the Holy Spirit living out from you testify to the world do everything that you can to feed that fire every single day because brother Branham tells us that no age ever comes back after the Revival dies no age ever comes back after the Revival dies because the cycle of Revival and death has never failed there would be a Revival in that age would go into death there'd be a Revival and then that age would go into death and then a Revival and then that age would go into death but this word Revival that we're a part of wasn't sent that we could go into the ground this word Revival was sent that there would be a people that makes themselves ready and dresses themselves in the word that can go into the Garner it was sent to produce a Rapture it was sent to produce people that say I can't ever go back again and they keep the fire burning day after day after day all the way until that bright morning when he comes to take us home that's what I want to be I want to be one that breaks the cycle of Revival and death coming down to the last few sections one of them was entitled 10 years of tribulation verse 10. fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and you shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a Crown of Life he starts off by telling them straight out don't fear these things that are coming in other words he said he says trials tribulation even that these things are coming Satan's going to throw you in the devil's going to cast you into prison you shall have tribulation 10 days but be faithful unto death hardships are coming young people trials are coming but he's telling them I'm going to be with you that don't mean I'm going to stop it but I'm going to be with you you be faithful you be true you be strong because there's a promise at the end of that I will give thee a Crown of Life the 10 years tribulation this is actually being done to them by Jews it's being done to them by Pagan priest it's being done to them by Governors trying to find favor with the people and they were enduring great persecution by the thousands Christians were being imprisoned they were being killed by lines thrown in there with Gladiators there would be tortured they were being burned but notice what the scripture says this is about what we just talked about the blame doesn't go on the people he says the devil will cast some of you into prison that you may be tried he's addressing the spirit behind it he's addressing the motivation and the Bible says it's Satan that's doing it it's his hatred of the True Vine behind all of it he's behind all of this because he hates God and what God has set is hard on Satan is bound to try to destroy I want you to notice the connection that brother Brownell makes right here he says but watch here is some illumination if Satan is behind the Jews who are hailing the Christians in the court then the Jews are not of God's religion but they're the Devils their Gathering is also of the synagogue of Satan now he says if that's what he called the Jews that did this that persecuted the church and killed all these he says and if the Roman Catholic Church killed the multitudes of Believers in the Dark Ages yes and in all ages then they are of the devil and belong to Satan also in other words what he's saying is if because the Jews of this time did this and God placed them as being of the devil then anyone who carries out these same actions down through history as the Roman Catholic Church did are also of the synagogue of Satan and they are of the devil the persecution that they're putting on the people who further exposes the true and the false Vine and their deeds began to expose them and the vines are going in almost total opposite directions and all this persecution this is what I want you to understand as we come down I have two slides left it wasn't done because they hated religion remember Cain was very religious the Pharisees were very religious it was done in the name of religion it was done by the false Vine who were very religious calling the truevine Heretics and saying that the church needed to be purged and we need to get that fanaticism out of here and and they were literally killing them in the name of religion claiming to be the true brother Branham says let them organize and repudiate the little flock they but further reveal to all that they are of the devil they are the false Vine the vine that murders their hatred proves who they are the nicolaitan Antichrist church is who they are it said tribulation 10 days this is actually a prophecy during this time the persecution was so strong and terrible and bloody brother Brown says that if it wasn't for the grace of God every believer would have been wiped out every believer he says Thou shalt have tribulation ten days and the reason it's a prophecy is this was a 10-year Reign of Terror from 302 to 312. it's where they launched this and for 10 years they slaughtered and killed and massacred every True Believer but he tells them he says be faithful unto death many of them sealed their life sealed their testimony I mean with their life thousands brother Branham says yay Millions have died during all the ages I want you to listen in for just a minute as we wrap this up he says they died in the faith like Antipas the faithful martyr they held not their lives dear unto the death often we think that it would be almost impossible to be a martyr think about how many of you think about those days ago there's no way I could I mean imagine just walking out there willingly going to the stake to be burned going out to be eaten by lines I couldn't no I couldn't how'd they do it how'd they do it I could never and brother Branham says but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to Triumph in Christ Jesus is the same faith that upholds the polycarps and all the martyrs the Supreme Faith this sentence right here just blessed me the Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour blessed be God forever he says the faith that you use every single day is the exact same faith that let them face the lines the faith that you overcome laodicea with is the exact same faith that they have it's the faith for the hour he says it will rise to the occasion the faith that you have is strong enough for what you're going to face is what he's saying I don't know if I'm going to make it brother Aaron the faith you have is the Supreme faith for the Supreme hour you're gonna make it I don't know if I can Rapture the faith that let them go to the Coliseum and stand there and be eaten by lions it's the same Faith you come over come with today and tomorrow it's the same Jesus it's the same Faith that's going to Rapture you it's the same faith that heals you it's the same faith and I say had you stood then you could have done it and if they stood now they could do it because it's the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be God forever it's the same faith that faith will not let you down when the Trials come but that faith will rise to the occasion he says a Crown of Life and I will give thee a Crown of Life but Brown says but the crowd spoken of here in the Revelation given to a martyr is the crown of royalty Jesus calls it the Crown of Life the one Crown is for those who have striven and the other is for those who have given he says this Crown is an Incorruptible crown and I believe that's all what we're fighting for I'm going to close this out and I'm going to pull up if I can my table lap because the last quote that I put in there wasn't there here it is and it may not come up on the screen and that's fine I just want to read it to you he says one Crown is for those who have striven the other is for those who have given both crowns are incorruptible they will not perish the winners of the worldly race the ones who are out there with the best job the best career the best houses the best cars the best the best those are winners of the worldly race he says those will all perish why did that just happen he says they will soon lose the joy of the plaudits of the world their Glory will fail but those who give their lives for God oh brother Aaron I didn't give my life for God I no no he makes it very clear those who give their lives for God either by daily striving or by shedding their blood as the crowning sacrifice of their lives will be given the Crown of Life how do we give our lives by daily striving by taking that same faith and applying it to our day by day applying it to our trials applying it to where we overcome that is daily striving and you will be given the same Crown of Life an Incorruptible Crown brother Brown says all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God and I want to ask you this is our closing thought we're done what are you striving the most for understand that we must strive for certain things here on Earth we can't take this all the way so we're not supposed to worry about getting a good job we're not supposed to worry about no that's not the truth at all don't don't run that way with it but what are you striving the most for where are you laying up your Rewards where are your Treasures laid up all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God the recompense of God is too lightly esteemed he says if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and an eternal Kingdom of substance then we ought to lay up in heaven those good Treasures that are available to the faithful Saints I want to lay my treasures up there I want to be rich in him I want to be rich in eternity I know there's things I have to take care of here but what are you striving the most for are you wanting to be rich here are you striving to be rich there are you striving to where on that day he says well done my good and faithful servant because there was a lot in that day that applied the faith they were given and gave their lives through the shedding of blood but he's just asking you to give your life on a day by day basis he says and you'll get a crown of life too you'll receive a Crown of Life remember Church the spirits never die the same spirits that came to try to Rob them and make them cold and formal it wasn't so in the beginning let's not let him Rob us let evening light Tabernacle let your life let's quit generalizing it let your life be a testimony of how an original believer worships how an original believer lives how an original believer overcomes the kindness and the Brotherly Love of original
