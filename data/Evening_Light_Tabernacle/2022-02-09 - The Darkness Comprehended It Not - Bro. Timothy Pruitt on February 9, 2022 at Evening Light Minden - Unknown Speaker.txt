we're headed father what a glorious gospel that we have today lord we just ask that you would bless us tonight together in your word lord just help us we pray but come in our lives your hands in jesus name amen amen let's turn to john chapter one in verse one amen i bring you greetings from brother kelly hildebrand this assembly there just outside of saskatoon we had a wonderful time this past weekend it was uh quite cold uh glad to be back hey man i guess they got off got off the plane it was negative 28 and uh you know after a long day of travel and you wore out and get there about two o'clock in the morning you walk outside it's negative 28. it'll wake you up real quick and uh but uh we thankful the services wasn't negative 28. amen but the fire of god moved in our midst there was many that gave their hearts to the lord and healings that were brought in and uh man a man over 70 years old gave his heart to the lord amen makes it worth it all amen for one soul to walk down the aisle it's worth every trouble it's worth every mile amen so we're thankful for that thank you for your prayers amen john chapter 1 and verse 1. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without without him was not anything made that was made but in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believed now he was not that light but was sent to bear bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh unto the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of flesh nor the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and of truth amen we'll let you be seated this evening i'd like to just speak to you this for a moment on the darkness comprehendeth it not quite um wonderful scripture reading here as we read john and his uh you know you can read the other gospels and john puts it in a way that no other gospel put it and he would go back not to just the beginning of genealogy but to the beginning of the creation of the world and he would begin to explain things and and begin to unfold things and but you know it was amazing that he would come to this verse and the light shineth in darkness speaking of this life that was the light of men and this light shineth in darkness but the darkness comprehendeth it not now you know darkness can never stop light from shining but the benefit of light must be seen by those who walk in the light if your eye if you know if your eyes are closed while you're walking in sunlight the light does not help you in the steps that you take amen you're just as good as a you know walk as much as or good as a blind man would walk with your eyes closed that is what it what it's like for those who did not comprehend the light in the days of jesus their eyes were closed something had blinded them now we could read in second corinthians 4 and verse 3 it says but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine upon them so we see that the god of the age had blinded them the people's mind had blinded the people's minds so they could not see him nor understand him they would hear his words but they could not understand what he said they would see the miracles that would take place and yet still not understand who he was uh which is a you know paradox how could someone come and do things that no man could do you know it's a it's a paradox to think that someone could open the eyes of the blind and actually will get to it actually create eyeballs actually uh you know to cast out spirits of men of children that were cast into the fire by the by spirit casted out and do many mighty wonderful miracles but yet they still could not see who he was that's quite a blindness that has taken place when when you see the that those things can be done and in such a marvelous way but yet still not know who he is and you know it comes there's an entrance and psalms 119 and 130 says the entrance of thy words giveth light it giveth understanding to the simple so darkness can't stop it but it tries to hinder it it tries to block it it tries to stop up the entrance where the light comes to into the nerves and to the receptors amen you know i was just listening to a tape actually that was preached there in saskatoon there's about five services on tape he would preach more than that but there's five on tape well brother branham in the in a in a time there would describe of blindness he would just describe blindness as an individual invisible bam that would be over your hand cutting the blood flow off to your fingers and eventually the fingers would fall off he said that's exactly what happens in blindness he says a spirit to get over those optical nerves and begin to pull on them and squeeze them down and cut the blood flow off until that person becomes blind and he says see if it says if you could cut that ban then the blood flow would return and he said there is a power that will break that ban over the optical nerves of an eye and so the blood and light can come again and the word of god is a power there's a voice that speaks there's a word that goes forth there's a spirit that brings it to pass amen and then it's to curse the demons of hell that wants to cut the blood flow off to that part of the body and you know i thought it was very interesting as i i would listen to these tapes while i was in a motel there in saskatoon and brother brother kelly would give me some of the background of what had taken place well brother brandon would come and he said they would actually had rented a place that would hold three or four thousand people but somewhere around four or five hundred people would show up and you could tell brother branham would look at this and wonder about it and say some things as he would begin to say you know look we have this big building and not very many people here he said brother kelly said what had happened was all those churches around there those preachers and pastors had told their child their people if they showed up they would excommunicate them and so and then not only did they do that they came and said on the front row and to see who was there and to try to stop the presence of god the preaching of the word and the flow of the spirit amen and you know and i thought it was very interesting interesting in about the second service as i was listening to it brother branham comes in the prayer line and he's discerning now he's sitting he says now i want to get away from that for a moment and he begins to just ask people what their needs are and you know he said i just want to show you what prayer can do and he said he began to ask them and they would say this and they would say that and he'd begin to pray and in the middle of all this obstruction in the middle of all these people trying to hinder and trying to stop amen god came down and there was blind that received their sight it was death that heard there was a crippled boy that walked it was a little mute kid you can listen to him on the tape as he couldn't speak and hear his mama say he can't talk and brother branham prays for him and he said now i want you to say aye little boy would say i say love love jesus jesus in the middle of all of that god was still displaying his power amen because darkness will never stop light it'll try to hinder it it'll try to keep it back it'll try to hold it back but lightness light will always prevail amen and we see that satan had had blinded their eyes and the light had been put out and their hearts were hardened so they couldn't receive the light that had come into the world and no matter the signs he done or the miracles he wrought they never could receive that light and i thought that was interesting that those men that would you know i i feel like maybe if i had that attitude and but i saw the things god was doing i would i would say hey i'm wrong i'd call my church members say every one of y'all get down here come and see what god is doing amen because you know there's something about that when you begin to see god doing things only god could do it opens our eyes and we begin to realize who he is amen but in the middle of all of that those same men sat there same critics still critics say man would hold on to those things for years and years and years amen just as the pharisee amen shows you those spirits never die they're always trying to push out the supernatural they're always trying to hinder the move of god they're always trying to stop the blood flow in the church amen but god will have a people amen that has their eyes open has their hearts ready to believe amen the blood flowing through their bodies to receive all that god has for them but we see you know they stay you know there's also a thing about the sun that if you all right light if you stare at it too long and you try to figure it out it'll put your eyes out amen what they thought you know in that time was real light was actually darkness because they hear when they came to the real true vindicated light of their day amen they stared at it and they questioned it and they wondered about it and until their eyes were completely put out amen this is what you know it's i think it's quite a statement that jesus would say in luke chapter 11 verse 33 he says no man when he lighteth a candle putteth in the secret place neither under a bushel but on a candlestick that which may come and may see the light and the light of the body is the eye therefore when thy eye is single the whole body is full of light but when thy eye is evil thy body also is full of darkness take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness amen standing right there to people who thought they had the light they thought they had the words they did they had the words of isaiah they had the words of the prophet and right there trying to put out the very light that came into the world amen because they were living brother man would talk about their live was living now in the glare of another age amen we we see even ii corinthians satan transforming himself into an angel of light you say well i got the word but amen jesus said be careful that the light that is within thee be not darkness amen that it's not something that satan has interjected amen into your thoughts into your heart into the things and what you think is light is actually darkness amen we you know we see things as going on in the age that we're living in we see people that thought they had light and now they're realizing it's darkness amen darkness is dwelling in their lives and taking over them you know i i think it's amazing that that that a child could actually see something that that us adults many times can't see you know uh you know there was a there was a little child one time that would come to his mama and i'm going to just leave the names out of it would come to his mama and say you know i don't understand how this preacher is saying my granddad is not going to make it to heaven when my granddaddy is the one who will treat us right who will do right to us who who acts more like a christian than now this little kid was about eight years old actually more like a christian than anybody that i know of amen you know but yet this other ones was was full of darkness yet they were saying they were the light amen and a child could pick it up a child could see it a child could discern between the two spirits amen you know what is it it was a false light amen it was a false creed or a false dogma that was portrayed as light amen satan is trying to deceive the church world today by false light amen what is perceived to be light what is perceived to be the truth what is perceived to be right and inside of them is darkness they can be speaking things that they considered to be light and yet treating people and kicking people out and judging and saying you're not going to make it unless you do a certain thing that i do or you act a certain way or believe something that i believe what is it it is a false light you know the the greatest robbery at the time brother branham speaks about was a robbery i looked it up actually in england amen it was a false light that call that they robbed a train they held up a train because they put up a fault stop sign light and it caused this train to stop in a certain place amen am to where they could jump on it and they could rob it of millions of dollars one of the greatest robberies at the time amen by a false light where they could put a light on a railroad track and caution it and stop it and there the robbery took place a false light gave the greatest net robbery that the nations has ever known it robbed the nations of the greatest hold up the greatest robbery was done by a false light and the greatest robbery the church of god has ever had is a false light it's robbed people of their uh of their homes it's robbed people of their families this is separated then why by a false light portrayed to be the true light amen amen taking trying to take the place of the true light right amen rob there it is robbed the church he said a false light has robbed the church of the moving of the holy ghost a false life it delighted took the very lifeline from the church it robbed them of the word and they accepted the creed instead of the word it robbed them you know actually on my way home i i i went into the delta lounge there and i was sitting back there we had a few hours to in atlanta and i went into the lounge and i was looking at some things and this man come and sit across from me at the chair there and we he just began to strike up a conversation and so i began to talk to him we talked about all kinds of things but he asked me what i did for a living i said well i'm actually a a full-time minister in the gospel i said i i'm an assistant pastor at a home church there in louisiana he said oh he said that's wonderful he said you know he said our church is really having some problems he said you know i don't i don't know what i i don't know what to do about it he said i tried to tell he said we got an aids problem he said everybody in our church is dying he said because there's no young people there there's no youth and and he said i've tried to tell him you got to do this and you got to do that you got to do that we tried all kinds of things and he said i don't know what to do anymore because it's dying and he said what are y'all do y'all have any do you all have what do y'all do at your church do you have any young people i said well yes sir we got this many and probably in sunday school and about this many above sunday school he said well what are you doing i said well we're not we're not you haven't give them a creed or a dogma or some program we preach the gospel to them and there's a gospel that's not just a gospel of yesterday or our gospel that and there is a gospel that works and then there's a gospel that lives there's a light that can shine upon a heart and illuminate them to where they can realize who they truly are amen amen you know listen we want more than just light we want the true light we want more than just a word we want the true word we want more than just the spirit we want the holy ghost moving in our hearts and our lives we want what he has for us amen and some demon of hell wants to wrap himself around and cut the blood flow i say let there be a preacher rise up with enough power of the holy ghost to speak against that thing and cut it off the body amen but people get caught up in false lights but you know what's amazing about light when you go home tonight and it ain't so bad in the time in this in this season that we're in but come summertime you go go home at night and the light is giving you direction it's showing you amen the path that you need to take showing you of obstacles that rise maybe a tree fell over deer that jump out but it's also attracting bugs it's also attracting things that you don't really want to hit on your car and you know make make marks and things and all that kind of stuff what is it they are also attracted to the light amen and we find it amen wherever there's a true light it attracts true seed of god but it also attracts those who wants to see a miracle take place or see signs and wanders maybe interested about something about a better life and a better way of living amen but inside of them there's darkness they never allow they might allow the light to light up their outside but they never allow it to come on the inside and open up the secret compartments of their heart until the darkness begins to push back against the light amen but this robbery came from a false light and i you know i thought this is very interesting also brother man i'm talking about this he said it costs the church this false light has cost the church the great greatest robbery it's ever had cold creeds won't ripen a vindicated word grain cold creeds will not ripen a word vindicated a vindicated word grain amen jesus said the word of god is a seed crow cold creeds will not ripen the word cold blizzardy days won't ripen the wheat amen no no he says no indeed it it takes the warmth of the sunlight because it was god's spoken word to do such a thing it'll take the word spoken of god to show the saints of god that jesus christ lived just the same as he was yesterday he is today creeds and denominations cold and indifference the grain will rot right in the ground it takes the heat of the sun it takes the light of god's word it it takes more than just a theology or or a psychology it takes a living word made manifest he said i believe that's what's matter with the world today friends is because the world is trying to live in the glare of the light that shined in another day and that's what this man was speaking about he i believe he said he was a lutheran and and you know and i thought you know luther had a light but the light moved on but many people refused to move with the light they didn't want it amen they didn't want it you know it's they moved on they moved on to wesley to sanctification and they didn't want that no more you know they didn't want to move when it moved to the pentecostals and the restoration of the gifts and then they didn't want to move until it moved to the message and the things that we're doing it's happening in this day in this generation and of course people today say well we don't need no more the gifts that's the light of another day well why don't you throw the sanctification out and the justification out with it amen you know it takes it's still light it still takes justification it still takes sanctification it still takes the restoration of the gifts it still takes all of that amen but people want to throw out the pentecost and they but they don't want to throw out the other stuff listen i want all that god has i want everything that he has i want all of the light of god's word amen we need to be in the harvest time and in the harvest time amen the sun is shining the light of god's word is heating the ground and heating atmospheres around us why because seeds are coming to manifestation and then the sun is not only just bringing the wheat seeds to manifestation it's also bringing the weeds and the tears to manifestation amen the same light but we go you know it says what happens he said people are living in a glare of false light just like a mirage on the road how many's ever seen a mirage on the road they say you know you get out in the desert and you get real thirsty the sun kind of hit the desert and it looked like just like waters out there people have actually took off running and ran till they died thinking they're running to water amen it's a false conception it's a false idea of the sun he said when you get there it hasn't produced a thing but something false he said because you can't walk in the glare of the sun because it's a mirage always showing you something that there is that there's nothing to it he said when people try to tell you that jesus christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever they're leading you to a mirage he said when you get into a church and you join church and some creed or something there's nothing there no more than what you had in the world he said let me tell you don't ever refuse the true light of the gospel of jesus christ which brings the warming rays of the holy ghost upon you and makes you a new creature in christ jesus don't walk in some glare of another age that glare might have all been right in that age it might have been all right for them it's proof so in the day of our lord jesus he was a scriptural light for that day he was the light now i thought i thought it was very interesting how john put it he said john the baptist came representing the light but jesus was the light i know a lot of people's got it mixed up in this day that we're living in and they're looking to the wrong one for light amen william branham was not the light but he came representing him but there is the light and there is a light that can shine upon your heart and change you from glory to glory to glory and change you from a immature seed to a son of god he proved so he was a light when he came upon the earth to vindicate the promised word john was a bright and shining light certainly john had been prophesied by isaiah 700 years or so before his boy before his birth a voice of one be crying in the wilderness and malachi speaking up i'll send my messenger before my face to prepare the way here was john on earth making the written word live he was a voice of one crying in the wilderness amen and jesus said you want love to walk in his light because he was a bright and shining light but john said i must decrease my light must go out because i've served my time that the prophecy said of me but hear ye him he is the one follow him amen the jews thought they were worshipping in a true light they thought they were worshiping the same god and the very one they were thought they were worshiping was the one that was turning down there where everyone they thought they were worshiping was the one that was crucified and it's the same thing today there where one they call themselves worshipping is the very one they're criticizing it's the very one they're making fun of and making folly of and joking about and saying there's a bunch of emotional work up saying there's a bunch of this or that and the other amen but you know we need something sane and sensible there is something insane and sensible it's the baptism of the holy ghost it's the warmings of the son of god that'll warm your hearts amen out of a cold form of condition give you an amen inside of you a response to the word of god the one they thought they were worshiping they were crucified the one they were making fun of the very god making him a life in stock of the people the very god they thought they were worshiping jesus said the blind lead the blind they all fall in the ditch the hour at hand now when the light is shining that gospel light and the power the resurrecting the direction of jesus christ manifest himself that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he lauded that for this day the things that he promised for this day must happen in this day if the church won't accept it god is able these stones to rise children up to abraham he'll get his message over hallelujah oh hallelujah because he's always done it and he always will do it people thinking they're walking in the light and they're walking in the traditions of their fathers and the first thing you know they're walking in a glare of a light not the light but they reject that light that they claim to be worshiping his works thoroughly vindicated who he was search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life they are they that testify me amen who can prove what i've said anything or claim that i've made that the heavenly father hasn't vindicated that through me he's proved to us he was the light of the hour because it was all prophesied that this messiah should be the way and here it bloomed alive but their traditions had separated them from the real light of the word pharisees sadducees herodians whatever might be they'd got the world so gamed up like they do in all ages there's some pharisees sadducees the men may have died but that spirit still lives they gone up so people cannot see the real light and then in the place of the true light they put a false light i mean remember just a few years ago maybe it was our last banquet i can't quite remember but brother danny steeman came and ministered and he talked about the turtles how they're born on the beach you know and and under a light of the moon they're to look at the light of the moon and that moon leads them back to where they came from he said but in the time that we're living in in cities have come up amen and they built great highways and great walls and and great buildings and things and they put street lights up there amen it is a false light to a turtle it's an artificial light amen it's a man made light and those turtles get confused when they come and their eyes are open and they begin to go after what they think is the moon but it's a false light and it leads them to a place to where they become dead on a highway run over by a car and this is what we're seeing the time that we're living in amen men have put up their own yard lights they're on street lights and say this is this street and this is this way and this is the way there's only one true way and that is the light jesus christ is only one way to salvation it's not through a creed it's not through a dogma it's not through a message idea it's through jesus christ but we got lights up and they're man-made lights and thousands are going after them and dying and you see their homes wrecked you see their lives wrecked you see them scarred up beat up mangled up messes because they followed after a man's light because i'm going to tell you every man-made light will go out every false doctrine will die but when that man's light goes out it leaves people in darkness that's all they got left but if you'll follow after his light that light will never go out all hell can't put that light out it can blow it ain't got no time of exp expiration date amen these lights right up here they got expiration days they may last longer than what they think they're probably gonna last less than what they promised amen but one day they're going to go out because their man made lights their man made ideas put on paper brought to a factory and put amen and made and manufactured and put up in this ceiling but one day they'll go out amen amen and every man may creed every man made doctrine every man-made idea it will go out amen that it's going to happen ain't matter hell and put it out winds of every every kind of devils of hell will come against it but there is a light amen hell can come against it demons can fight against it every kind of critic can beat their brains out against it but it'll still shine still pulsate down into the darkest of nights amen to reach out to the farthest places to go to the furthest souls that's conquered i want that light i wanted jesus christ as real today not just a church not just a creed not just a dogma i want a powerful living presence of almighty god he said lo a little while and the world won't see me why won't they see him he was vindicated in this age more than any age there's ever been since 2 000 years ago he walked on the shores of galilee and the world didn't see him they said well that was just that was just a hocus pocus you know this that they got all kind of a bunch of nonsense they're blind the light has put them put their eyes out the god of this world has blinded them he said been thoroughly vindicated by the word and by the works that he's been doing but yet none of them wanted to believe it proving his light was his word he said search the scripture but the traditions that we're living in well we believe moses moses is who we believe we don't know when you come we don't we where'd you get your education what can you prove that you're there his works testified who he was if they'd only read the bible they was reading it but they couldn't see it my works identified amen a man is known by his credentials and the credentials of the word of god to be sent by the word of god with the word of god same in every age it's always been you can't live by yesterday's light yesterday's light is history you can't get warm by sun that shine yesterday you got to have a sun for today amen what's the matter with the churches today that's what's the matter with people they're trying to live by what happened yesterday you cannot get worn by a painted fire amen you can paint it just as beautiful as you want to paint it but if it ain't got life in it there's no heat in it listen we can paint a fire as big as this wall and have fire licks of fire going up and it wouldn't none of us get worn by it you can paint it as big as whatever you want to paint it's painted on there and men have painted jesus christ and they made him a certain way and they made him this and they know life inside of there but if you'll bring the god back to the scriptures to where he's vindicated and life can flow through the body and he can go it'll warm you it'll make you where you're not cold and indifferent no more it'll make you where all those cold creeds have fallen off and there's something on the inside of you there's life the sunlight is sent to the earth to ripen the grain for the advancing of harvest each day brings forth a new sun the sun the shine of the day bringing the wheat up and shine it and shine until that week comes to fruition but you know we see people are looking back looking at something else their past experiences their past moments what kind of condition would you be in right now if the last time you saw the sun and the last time you felt this raise was even four days ago weeks ago i'm talking about it was gone probably wouldn't take but just a few seconds we cold block of ice now we understand why churches are cold blocks of ice because the sun hadn't been shining there a false light might been shining the lights may have been on but something is missing there's no there's no moving of the spirit of god and they they want to clamp down on it about why they want to they want to put out their own light portray their own light show who they are instead of who he is but he says here let me find this spot i'm wanting to find let's just go back to john chapter 1. and the light verse 5 the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended that not now there's many there's actually several different meanings to this word comprehend comprehend perceive obtain attain lay hold of there's also another meaning which is to take or to overcome as of the evil overtaken one you know i've looked at different bible translations and some use the part comprehend as the king james does and some use the word extinguish you know there's different translations of the same word perceive overcome extinguish never put out did not overtake apprehend overpower the light so as all of these are our definitions of the same word used for comprehension but you know i believe that john 1 5 has a double meaning brother branham would say it speak that all scriptures have a compound meaning and you know i believe one light came and as hard as it tried darkness could not overcome it darkness could not stop it satan had tried for years he tried to put it out all down to the prophets amen but light kept moving it kept moving it kept moving and here it came the great and shining light and he tried to kill it he tried to put it a grave he tried to he tried to put it out but that light rose again amen it could not comprehend it could not overtake it it could not stop it also number two light came and the people in darkness could not understand it you know why because you must experience light before you can comprehend light amen you must experience what true light is amen until you can really comprehend what it is now if you lived in this building all your life from the day you was born and you never went outside you never saw the sun you could not comprehend what that sun does and what all it does what all it you know entails what it looks like how it acts what it what it feels like you could not comprehend it unless you experienced it and this is exactly where people are today they can't comprehend the holy ghost they can't they can't preach the holy ghost why because they have never experienced the holy ghost but once you experience the holy ghost in your life that's why brother branham said a man should never preach the gospel until he's been on the backside of the desert in the desert where the sun is beating down and it's beating out all the creeds and it's beating out all of his ideas and the holy ghost is burning inside of him amen he shouldn't never preach until he has that experience and once he's experienced it then he can preach it once he's experienced it he can let it flow from his life because amen he has been in the presence of almighty god listen i don't want a preacher that's never i don't even want to listen to one that's never been in the presence of god i don't want to listen to one who ain't been in the presence of god in the last few days or last few hours i want to listen to a preacher that's experienced god for himself and he knows a real living christ that way he can preach it where i can understand it because he has experienced it and comprehends it but the problem is we've got too many preachers that don't comprehend they don't comprehend what the holy ghost can do in this hour therefore they want to put their own light on it and they want to put there in a box and it shines only in this box it only moves in this box it only operates in this box he only does this and this time and the holy ghost ain't interested in your boxes he ain't interested in your walls he ain't interested in your ideas amen the son of god the sunshine trying to go beyond the walls of man it'll go beyond your flimsy box and it'll burn down on the inside amen if you'll ever let him go and let him into your heart it'll begin to illuminate every section of your life every section of your body amen there is a light that wants to shine upon you and break you out of your darkness but you must experience it before you can ever comprehend it you must experience the sun before you could ever say what it is you must experience fire before you could ever understand what it could do because if you hadn't ever experienced fire chances are you'd walk up to it and put your finger in it but if you know what fire is no you'll just gather the warmth of the fire enjoy the bask in its glory amen you know this is this is one of my favorite events in jesus is life just personally i mean i love the miracles this is a miracle but i love the fishes and loaves and love i mean all the things but this is one of my favorites it's john 9 and verse 1. so when jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind ain't that the way the devil likes to question i've heard that same question before amen when my little boy andrew was born with no surfactant in his lungs amen the first question that was asking me was walking down the hallway the devil said what did you do you must have done something for you to be going through what you're going through for your son to be about he's he's going to die because of what you did and i'm going through my mind wondering what i did amen but jesus answered them saying neither has this man sin nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him so the light can shine upon him oh hallelujah amen if we can get this eye this understanding tonight that whatever we're going through is for purpose is for a reason it's not necessarily because you've done something wrong or sinned in your life or thing but it's shy that the thing that you're going on going through is there because god wants to shine especially upon you god wants to reveal himself to you he said i must work the works of him that sent me while his day the night cometh when no man can work and as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world and when he does spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with clay and said to him go wash in the pool of siloam which is by our interpretation sin and he went his way therefore and washed and came see oh my that was kind of a different deal right there hey man he didn't just speak to it he watered up a good water spot a spit and spit in the ground and got him a piece of clay and he began to mold it just like he did back there amen in days of adam as he was creating that first man he'd done this before and if he done it before he can do it again and he's putting it there and he's placing it in his eyeballs and he spits again and makes some more little mud and some clay and the right kind of ashes and right there he knew what it took to make an eyeball and he put it in his eyes and he said now you go wash and he went washed and he came back seeing what was it now he could experience light for himself while he was blind he couldn't tell anybody what light was while it was in darkness he didn't have a clue what light was but now his eyes were open now he could see and therefore he could tell somebody i know what it's like to be blind but now i know what it's like to see [Applause] blessed be the name of the lord and the neighbors therefore they which before had seen him that he was blind said is this not he that sat and begged some said this is he other says well he's like him but he said i am he amen see listen nobody could ever rob you of that experience we heard brother ben talk about that they might rob you of the of the moment and the memory of it all but they'll never rob you of that experience amen others you know it's amazing we read here and we really find out that the blind man wasn't the blind man you know there's a there's a song that's real good kind of catchy it talks about the lame man that walked and and the deaf man that heard and the dumb man that spake he said but won't you just ask the blind man he saw it all amen jesus amen knows how to orchestrate and move amen in possible situations and to where other people may not know i think this is who the i thought it was kind of looks like him something about him different something's something strange here but he said i'm he therefore said they unto him how were thy eyes open he said well i mean a man named jesus made some clay and going on in my eyes and said to go washing i went and washed them i received my sight and they said where is he so i don't know and they brought the pharisee to him that was a four time was blind and it was a sabbath day when she uh oh you know it was some false light that got messed up the sabbath day was jesus made clay and opened his eyes and again the pharisees also asked him how he received a sight and he said well he put clay upon my eyes and i washed and do therefore said some of the pharisees this man is not of god because he keepeth not our light he don't respect our light so he can't be the man of god others say well how can this man how can a man that is a sinner do much miracles or do this miracle and there was a division among them some said well there ain't no way it could be god because he's a sinner others said well how can a sinner do this and not be god or how can it be a sinner a they didn't have very good light their light wasn't very bright it was a false light amen it was no longer the true light it was a division among them they said in the blind man again what sayeth thou of him that thou has opened thy eyes he said he's a prophet amen something was beginning to dawn inside of him amen just like the woman at the well amen when she came there amen her life was her water pot that was the light of her her amen that's all the light she had left when jesus asked for a drink he said she said she said well you know you ain't customary you'd ask me of a drink he said well if you knew who i was you would ask me of a drink she said how are you going to give me a drink you don't even have a water pot that was her light but the scripture by the time it was over with the light began to shine upon her and she began to realize you know what this flashlight i walked up here with it ain't no good no more it don't do what i thought it did amen i found a greater light amen because she went from a jew to a prophet to thou must be the messiah what was it light was dawning upon her heart until the scripture said she went into the city and left her water pot what she thought was important wasn't important no more when you see the true living word of god manifested in your life what you thought was like what you thought was important is not important no more you'll leave it and run to the city and say come see a man who's told me all things this jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his sight until they called the parents they asked them is this your son who you say was born blind how does then does he now see his parents answered him said we know that this is our son and we know that he was born blind but by what means we know he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he his of age ask him he shall speak for himself now we see that when the light shines on their hearts this word spoke to parents because they feared the jews for the jews had agreed already that any man did confess that he was a christ he'll be put out of the synagogue yeah just like saskatoon same spirit same false light same dogma therefore his parents said he is of age ask him and then again called they the man that was blind and said to him god give god the praise we know this man's a sinner what he answered and said whether he'd be a sinner or not i know not but one thing i know whereas i was blind now i see [Applause] they said then said then to him what did he what did he to thee how open he thou an eyes and he said i've already told you and you did not hear wherefore will you hear it again will you be his disciples if i tell you one more time will you hear it again if i testify one more time that i once was blind but now i see will you be as disciple [Applause] and they reviled him and said thou art his disciple but we are moses's disciple we got the prophet we got his tapes oops sorry we got his books we got him we know that god's speaking to moses but as for this fellow we know not from which he is now this man didn't get fed up he said i just found i just realized y'all just stupid the man answered said well herein is a marvelous thing that you know not from whence he is and yet he has opened my eyes now we know that god here is not sinners but if any man be a worshiper of god and doeth will him he heareth since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind if this man was not of god he could do nothing oh hallelujah if this man were not of god he could do nothing and the answer and said thou was altogether born in sins and thus teach us like they wouldn't born in sin they was born in the same sin shaped in the same iniquities anybody else needed the same blood but somehow by their light they convinced themselves i'm all right yet the cage of every unclean and hateful bird this is what happens in false lights it don't expose the true darkness hello somebody false lights does not expose the true darkness therefore in false lights and false light churches that teaches false light you can have every unclean bird you can have homosexuals you can have deacons committing amen ungodly sins on their own on granddaughters you can have all kinds of stuff why it's a false light but if a true light shines inside of there it'll expose every roach it'll expose every dome it'll expose everything the devil's ever done because it's the holy ghost in fire and they cast him out the best thing that ever happened to him and jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he found him he says does thou believe on the son of god and he said answer and said lord who is he that i might believe on him and jesus said unto him thou hast both seen him and it is he that talketh with thee and he said lord i believe and he worshipped him and jesus said for judgment i've come to this world that they would see my not see not might see and they which see might be made blind the same light gives light to some and blinds the other it depends on how you're looking at him some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words and said them are we blind also jesus said if you were blind you should have no sin but now you say we see therefore your sin remaineth if you would say god i'm blind i'm worse than that blind man i don't i didn't see it but now i see he said then your sin would be taken away but because you said we see your sin is going to remain darkness has tried for thousands and thousands of years to put out light it's tried to cancel it amen but darkness will never extinguish light darkness will never suppress light darkness will never overcome light darkness will never put out light amen darkness will never comprehend light amen as long as god has a people here on the earth amen that will always be the supernatural light of god shining it's an eternal life as we said before light is an attractant it also not only does it attract the true it also attracts the faults it attracts bugs it attracts spiders it attracts insects it attracts things by giving you light as it lights your path it's always a it's also lightening the evil and attracting them pulling the bugs in and the spiders in brother brandon would talk about this as we bring this down he said you know because i went to the statue of liberty with that big arm out there holding that light and he said laying under there was a bunch of dead sparrows and he says a bunch of dead sparrows he said looking at those little sparrows laying there i said said to the guard that was with me i said what's the matter with them little birds he said they died last night said there was a storm come up and they were flying in the storm and they came into the light but instead of using the light from the statue of liberty as a peaceful thing as a safety they came and tried to black the light out and they beat against it until their little heads were beat their brains out and they're laying dead because they refused to follow the light and now they beat their brains out he said oh god what an example of this the men and women raising up today people who try to deny god's bible people and i'll say this people who try to deny god's prophet tries to deny the true living word today instead of accepting this life as a place of safety as a guidance they beat against it and they beat against it and they beat against it you can beat all you want to but you'll never put out the light you can beat against this message oh you want to you can make all the videos you want to make and post them on youtube you can beat and you can beat and you can be until your brains are beat out but you will never i said you will never put this light out amen and just says that light donated by another country is still standing there as a sound of freedom so is this gospel line it's still standing against every storm against every wave against every black bird that wants to come and beat against it and try to black it out you'll never black it out but it'll stand throughout eternity as a sound of freedom as a sound of a peace and harmony as a place of safety for those who desire safety they're beating their heads out but this word will remain forever upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it when peter first made his confession thou art the christ the son of the living god he said blessed art thou peter for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you you've never learned it in a seminary you never learned it from what somebody else said but my father has given it unto you and upon this rock this revelation of who i am the gates of hell will not prevail against it it'll be against it it's going to try to block it out and there's going to be more critics there's going to be more videos there's going to be more than nonsense but they'll be the ones laying dead amen beyond below the line as we rise and go towards that great and shining light into that body change don't forget as i told you last wednesday it's getting dark it's getting dark and it's getting darker until you almost can't see the hand in front of your face but why is it getting darker because behind that darkness it ain't darkness is pushing it's light is pushing if you'll begin to realize that ain't darkness is getting greater it's light that's getting greater and light is behind the darkness and it's pushing pushing pushing pushing and darkness is trying to hold and darkness is trying to hold but light will prevail and it's going to break through one glorious day and out of that line amen a little 19 year old woman named karen pruitt is going to step out and tap us on the shoulder a little man called jerry show is going to step out and tap you on the shoulder hallelujah light is pushing light is pushing i'm not going to fight against the light i'm going to stand with the light i'm going to stand with what it has and say god shine on me shine on leave even like tabernacle and lord may we bask in the rays may we bask in the heat make coldness and formalness never come into these doors [Applause] make creeds and domes never feel comfortable here because of that great and shining light let's stand together i wanted to go into what's the attraction on the mount brother brown would talk about the attraction as jesus would ride down there he said it attracted more than just believers it attracted unbelievers and make believers people saying shut they'll shut them up they're too loud people saying it's just a bunch of emotion go listen to it what's the traction on the mount he said but then it also attracted a people that was fulfilling prophecy god was fulfilling prophecy he said when it when god is fulfilling prophecy it always causes an attraction it brings all the critics up it brings the vultures up but it also brings the eagles they come together to find out what's going on some come for curiosity some come to find fault some come to criticize it gathers all kinds believers make believers unbelievers but what's happening on the mountain prophecy is being fulfilled what's happening in our day prophecy is being fulfilled it's attracting all kinds but it also attracts the true what prophecy listen to the prophecy it was fulfilling rejoice greatly rejoice greatly old daughters when this king comes i want you all to be real quiet i want you to just be sensible and just stay in your seats just little amen will do rejoice greatly rejoice greatly old daughters of zion shout yes oh daughters up to jerusalem behold the king cometh unto thee having salvation well that's something to shout about amen was the king coming amen down that little dusty road and people begin to sing hosanna hosanna hosanna what were they doing fulfilling prophecy and meanwhile right over here was somebody saying be quiet stop it stop it don't do that you're getting out of order stop stop stop he said they don't cry out the rocks are going to because they're forgot something's got to fulfill prophecy something's got to fulfill the scriptures and and you wonder why are we excited why because i know i once was blind but now i see and i can see who's in our midst it's not just some man-made creed or some man make dogma or something of 50 or 60 years ago it's still the same today producing the same signs he's still healing the sick he's still saving the loss he's still bringing our family back he's still doing all of that it makes me want to shout because he's still bringing salvation he's still bringing healing it's the king in our midst [Applause] if you don't have the king in your midst you got the right to just sit in your seat and don't say a word but when the king comes he deserves the glory he deserves the honor he deserves the praise and somebody is going to fulfill prophecy let's buy our hands he said of scribes and preachers and ministers and spiritual men so-called anointing ones would only read their bibles they wouldn't be wondering what's taking place they would know what it is god is fulfilling his word history is being made prophecy is being fulfilled salvation coming to the dying world what a great day all the graves were waiting for that day all that had died was waiting for that day all the righteous blood of the martyrs and prophets was waiting waiting for that day [Music] everyone in the grave i abraham isaac jacob all the prophets were waiting for this hour and the same as today all the saints has died down through 2000 years of church ages is waiting for this day right here he was the answer to the prophet's prophecy he was a fulfillment of scripture and people wanted them to be quiet don't get excited don't get worked up apparently you're not seeing what i'm seeing i see the king is risen the word is in position i feel like one of those soldiers coming back from the world war ii on that old ship they entered into that harbor they could still see that token that symbol of freedom shining that statue of liberty tears began to stream in their eyes because they knew right beyond that was their loved ones right beyond that was their home right beyond that was where they truly belong oh hallelujah you want to watch the tears are streaming down our eyes rejoicing in our hearts dancing and carrying on because we still see that old ship of zion sailing towards that shore and that light is still shining and it's shining through every dark spirit of laodicea it's shining through every dark crevice and i know just beyond that great light is my home i know just beyond that as my loved ones i know just beyond that it's where i come from it makes me want to shout to know how close i am to home don't beat your head against it enjoy the rays of the sun bask in his glory let it ripen you let it fulfill god's word in your heart amen father take your words tonight lord take them into our hearts lord let your light just shine lord like never before in our lives lord that we can see you greater than we ever saw you lord lord i believe it's the way it is the church of the living god is looking and seeing more of
