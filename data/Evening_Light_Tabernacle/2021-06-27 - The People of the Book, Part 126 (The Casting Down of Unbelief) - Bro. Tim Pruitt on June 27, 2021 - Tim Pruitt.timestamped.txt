[1:04:22] expecting the exceeding abundantly
[1:04:25] we're going to be speaking on the
[1:04:26] casting down of
[1:04:28] unbelief amen because when we cast satan
[1:04:32] down
[1:04:32] we're casting down unbelief amen
[1:04:36] and of course we none of us should
[1:04:38] disbelieve in this day
[1:04:40] after god's done so much to confirm his
[1:04:42] word
[1:04:43] what right have we got to disbelieve any
[1:04:45] promise
[1:04:46] amen amen we have received a more
[1:04:49] sure word of prophecy thank you lord
[1:04:53] revelation 12 and verse 7 and there was
[1:04:55] war in heaven michael and his angels
[1:04:57] fought against the dragon the dragon
[1:04:59] fought and his angels
[1:05:01] and prevailed not just remind the devil
[1:05:03] right now
[1:05:05] he ain't going to win and
[1:05:08] the the dragon fought and his angels
[1:05:10] prevailed not neither was their place
[1:05:12] found any more in heaven
[1:05:14] and the great dragon was cast out that
[1:05:16] old serpent called the devil and satan
[1:05:18] which deceiveth the whole world
[1:05:20] he was cast out into the earth and his
[1:05:22] angels were cast out with him
[1:05:24] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[1:05:27] heaven
[1:05:28] now has come salvation and strength and
[1:05:31] the kingdom of our god
[1:05:32] and the power of his christ for the
[1:05:34] accuser of our brethren is cast
[1:05:36] down which accused them before our god
[1:05:39] day and night
[1:05:40] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:05:42] the lamb and by the word
[1:05:44] of their confession their testimony
[1:05:47] and they loved not their lives unto the
[1:05:49] death therefore rejoice your heavens and
[1:05:52] ye that dwell in them
[1:05:53] woe to the inhabiters of the earth unto
[1:05:55] the sea for the devils come down to you
[1:05:57] having great wrath
[1:05:59] because he knoweth he had half but a
[1:06:02] short time just
[1:06:03] three and a half years amen
[1:06:06] and his time is going to be over with
[1:06:09] amen god bless you can be seated
[1:06:12] last sunday we spoke on the advances of
[1:06:14] science and
[1:06:16] that has brought us into new realms that
[1:06:18] has been previously
[1:06:20] unknown to mankind and
[1:06:23] until we are now naturally
[1:06:26] a supernatural people commonly doing
[1:06:30] every day
[1:06:31] without thinking about it using the
[1:06:33] invisible world of
[1:06:35] radio waves and microwaves and
[1:06:38] electricity and
[1:06:40] we have expand we had advanced way
[1:06:42] beyond our forefathers
[1:06:45] and we have advanced to into what was
[1:06:48] one time
[1:06:49] only the imaginary fiction world
[1:06:53] even um you know they used to have a
[1:06:56] cartoon or comic character dick tracy
[1:06:59] that they would imagine and and
[1:07:03] kind of you know try to try to imagine
[1:07:06] what it would be
[1:07:07] one day and now we are here advanced in
[1:07:10] that very time
[1:07:12] and brother branham told us um about
[1:07:14] this he said i was thinking about
[1:07:16] the few moments ago upon the subject of
[1:07:19] science
[1:07:20] how that they are taking the natural man
[1:07:22] and how he's went into the research from
[1:07:25] the fall of the natural and what he has
[1:07:27] done
[1:07:28] and how little the spiritual man has
[1:07:31] progressed in the kingdom of god he said
[1:07:33] i was thinking about how science is done
[1:07:36] but then how little the spiritual man
[1:07:37] has done and i was thinking that the
[1:07:40] natural man went out of the
[1:07:42] at the unseen of his eye and pulled an
[1:07:44] atom out of the sky
[1:07:45] and split that atom in two that destroys
[1:07:48] human life
[1:07:50] and if the natural man that knows
[1:07:52] nothing of god
[1:07:53] and cannot know nothing of god except
[1:07:56] he'd be
[1:07:56] converted then his soul becomes
[1:08:00] alive with the supernatural if he could
[1:08:02] do that in the natural realm
[1:08:04] what ought the man of god to be doing my
[1:08:07] my friends the church is so
[1:08:09] far behind let's pray my
[1:08:12] my that god will move his church up the
[1:08:15] natural man with
[1:08:16] natural resources is getting greater
[1:08:18] results than the people that calls
[1:08:20] himself christian let's
[1:08:21] press into the unseen the blessings are
[1:08:25] yours
[1:08:26] they are for you amen so i'll tell you
[1:08:29] what we have room for advancement
[1:08:32] and i think that's what the prophet of
[1:08:34] god was calling for us to do as we look
[1:08:36] around and see what the
[1:08:37] church world has done then we ought to
[1:08:39] be able to look at our own self
[1:08:42] and the promises of the word of god and
[1:08:44] say let's advance all the way into it
[1:08:46] it's rapture
[1:08:47] hour it's rapture time now he would
[1:08:50] explain it like this
[1:08:51] in this in the israel in the church he
[1:08:54] would talk about
[1:08:55] um three different uh spheres that
[1:08:58] um like one is where the nominal church
[1:09:02] is and
[1:09:03] up here is the sublime and and where
[1:09:05] we're supposed to be
[1:09:07] right next to the door to heaven where
[1:09:09] the powers of god are leaking down it
[1:09:11] drops on down through this
[1:09:13] and that one and he said it then this
[1:09:16] is a norm nominal church it goes on into
[1:09:19] just on on down into cold professions
[1:09:22] just a ritualistic affair that's the
[1:09:25] nominal church they get the slight
[1:09:26] drippings
[1:09:27] the next up here a little higher than
[1:09:30] that is the full gospel they get
[1:09:32] some of the blessings but they go off
[1:09:34] into islands
[1:09:35] if we've got to lift into this next
[1:09:38] sphere
[1:09:39] here before we can ever have a rapture
[1:09:42] it's exactly you got to get up in that
[1:09:44] before we can ever have it
[1:09:45] so you know there there's another realm
[1:09:48] higher to go
[1:09:50] in christ everybody ought to be an enoch
[1:09:52] to stay
[1:09:54] looking for another step another step
[1:09:56] higher
[1:09:57] amen not satisfied with where you are
[1:10:00] and i think as a church body we should
[1:10:03] not be satisfied there but
[1:10:05] look to the promise again he said no
[1:10:07] wonder christianity cannot lift her
[1:10:09] standard
[1:10:10] it's not because christ is not able but
[1:10:13] because the people won't do it
[1:10:16] the the message is ready the power of
[1:10:19] god is sufficient
[1:10:20] and men and women are scared to break
[1:10:23] out yonder
[1:10:24] into those fears before god and dare to
[1:10:28] trust him
[1:10:29] and take him at his word amen so
[1:10:32] we are people that are challenged to
[1:10:34] move into higher
[1:10:35] realms than any has ever walked
[1:10:39] iman even as faith um because somebody
[1:10:43] believed it could be done uh if it was
[1:10:46] if it was um edison or or emerson
[1:10:50] or the different men scientists if they
[1:10:52] were looking at a
[1:10:53] light bulb they believed it could be
[1:10:56] done
[1:10:57] they believed they could find a way and
[1:10:59] they worked at it until
[1:11:00] they they made it work and man
[1:11:04] what was it there was a drive and a
[1:11:06] passion in there they believed
[1:11:08] it could be done and we've got to
[1:11:11] believe that the word of god is going to
[1:11:12] be fulfilled in this hour
[1:11:15] and put our faith to work to move up
[1:11:18] into realms and
[1:11:19] you know no matter how many tries we
[1:11:21] have made
[1:11:22] to never give up to always persevere
[1:11:26] amen no matter how many times we prayed
[1:11:28] and it didn't seem like that prayer
[1:11:31] accomplished anything we pray again the
[1:11:34] effectual
[1:11:35] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[1:11:38] availeth much it is over and over he
[1:11:41] tells us of the unjust judge you know
[1:11:43] of the woman that come to him and he
[1:11:46] said i don't fear god and i don't fear
[1:11:48] man but i tell you what i know this
[1:11:50] woman ain't going to give up till i give
[1:11:51] her
[1:11:52] what she wants and he said so will god
[1:11:54] give to you
[1:11:55] that ask of him but he's looking for a
[1:11:58] people that are
[1:12:00] perseverant who are persistent
[1:12:03] with persistent faith to hold on to a
[1:12:07] divine promise of god
[1:12:09] now but brother branham said what has
[1:12:11] happened is that
[1:12:12] men and women are afraid or they're
[1:12:15] scared to break out yonder
[1:12:17] in those fears before god and to dare to
[1:12:21] trust
[1:12:22] him and to take him at his word you know
[1:12:25] why
[1:12:25] why it makes him scared is because it's
[1:12:28] the devil
[1:12:30] he knows that if the people get the true
[1:12:32] revelation
[1:12:34] of the true church and what she is
[1:12:37] and what she stands for and that she can
[1:12:41] do
[1:12:41] the greater works she will be an
[1:12:43] invincible army
[1:12:45] so of course she brings every kind of
[1:12:47] gossip of unbelief
[1:12:48] every kind of doubt every kind of fear
[1:12:51] every kind of thing to make you afraid
[1:12:54] and man so so that he can try to keep
[1:12:57] you from
[1:12:58] reaching higher from grasping a greater
[1:13:02] promise
[1:13:03] amen so you know he'll bring every every
[1:13:07] accusation he bring every imagination
[1:13:11] he'll bring every temptation he'll bring
[1:13:14] every kind of thing that you're going to
[1:13:16] fight it in the
[1:13:18] in the heavenly realms the more you move
[1:13:20] toward god
[1:13:21] the more you're going to be opposed by
[1:13:23] wicked spirits
[1:13:24] and i'll tell you what i must be getting
[1:13:26] really close to god because the devil
[1:13:29] has really been coming against us but i
[1:13:31] tell you greater is he that is in us
[1:13:34] than he that is in the world but you
[1:13:36] know there
[1:13:37] we have been given these things to cast
[1:13:40] down strongholds
[1:13:41] you know we live in the flesh but we
[1:13:43] don't wage war according to the flesh
[1:13:46] the weapons of our warfare we're taught
[1:13:49] are not weapons of the world
[1:13:50] but instead they are divine power to
[1:13:53] demolish strongholds
[1:13:56] and when we tear down arguments all the
[1:13:59] devil will argue against you
[1:14:01] he's always got a he's a debater now
[1:14:04] hey man he'll always bring an argument
[1:14:07] against where you're standing
[1:14:09] and reasoning and doubts and confusion
[1:14:12] and
[1:14:12] different kinds of reports and
[1:14:14] everything else he'll bring you
[1:14:16] memory of what happened to somebody else
[1:14:21] i mean they had this problem and they
[1:14:24] they
[1:14:24] had this situation and they had to live
[1:14:27] with
[1:14:28] their problem a long long time
[1:14:31] but i'm telling you right now we are
[1:14:33] casting down imaginations
[1:14:35] every presumption every argument that is
[1:14:39] set up against the knowledge of god
[1:14:41] and we take every thought somebody say
[1:14:44] everything
[1:14:45] every thought and make it obedient to
[1:14:48] christ
[1:14:52] amen now it's war
[1:14:56] we're reading you there as war heavens
[1:14:58] you you're
[1:14:59] you're battling it out and you're gonna
[1:15:02] have war we're here in this end time
[1:15:03] we're having war
[1:15:05] and for every believer it's time you get
[1:15:07] higher and every time you try to get
[1:15:09] higher
[1:15:10] in god every time you try to possess
[1:15:11] god's promise
[1:15:13] you just got to fight more amen
[1:15:17] now but you know he said in jeremiah
[1:15:20] 1 and 10 he said see this day i have set
[1:15:23] thee over nations
[1:15:26] and over the kingdoms to root out
[1:15:29] to pull down to destroy to throw down
[1:15:32] to build and to plant this
[1:15:36] is where god has set us i want you to
[1:15:39] see yourself as being positioned
[1:15:41] by almighty god amen i want to remind
[1:15:44] the devil this morning
[1:15:46] i have been positioned in a place of
[1:15:50] power and authority for he hath made us
[1:15:53] kings and priests to rule over a man and
[1:15:57] he'll
[1:15:57] set us over nations and over kingdoms
[1:16:01] to root out to pull down to destroy
[1:16:05] to throw down amen and to build up god's
[1:16:08] kingdom
[1:16:08] and to plant in righteousness
[1:16:14] now ephesians 6 11 we have been
[1:16:18] in the scripture and i want to just go
[1:16:20] through it again
[1:16:21] but put on the whole armor of god that
[1:16:24] you may be able to stand against the
[1:16:26] wiles of the devil
[1:16:27] now why didn't god just say look you
[1:16:29] don't need an armor i've done got it
[1:16:31] done
[1:16:32] i died at calvary i paid the price i'm
[1:16:35] the captain
[1:16:36] and i'm leading in battle and i've
[1:16:37] defeated the devil
[1:16:39] but no you got to go defeat your own
[1:16:44] david killed a goliath but you got to
[1:16:48] take your sword now
[1:16:52] come on now so put on the whole armor of
[1:16:55] god that you may be able to stand
[1:16:59] stand take your stand
[1:17:04] and not back up not retreat
[1:17:08] amen but stand against the wiles of the
[1:17:11] devil
[1:17:11] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:17:13] blood but against principalities against
[1:17:16] powers
[1:17:16] against rulers of the darkness of this
[1:17:19] world
[1:17:20] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:17:22] places
[1:17:23] it's war but put on the whole army of
[1:17:27] god
[1:17:28] dress for war put on the precepts of his
[1:17:32] word

[1:17:37] armed soldier
[1:17:38] so arm yourself with god's word
[1:17:41] amen every day amen taking that word
[1:17:45] i don't care if you're you know if you
[1:17:47] got to the point you think you're up to
[1:17:49] here and
[1:17:50] you got all the problems you know just

[1:17:53] make yourself eat

[1:17:57] it down

[1:25:22] and heavenly places in christ
[1:25:26] now we might be blessed here on earth
[1:25:30] you know but our blessings come
[1:25:34] from being seated with christ
[1:25:39] this is where our blessed blessings come
[1:25:41] it's because
[1:25:42] our position that the blood has placed
[1:25:45] us
[1:25:46] we're sons and daughters of god we have
[1:25:49] been adopted into his kingdom
[1:25:51] we're not waiting on adoption we have

[1:25:58] the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:26:00] so you see your your sons of god we're

[1:26:05] we have received our sonship now verse
[1:26:08] 17
[1:26:09] of chapter 1 of ephesians that the god
[1:26:12] of
[1:26:12] our lord jesus christ the father glory
[1:26:15] may give you the spirit of wisdom
[1:26:17] and revelation and the knowledge of him
[1:26:21] the under eyes of your understanding
[1:26:24] be enlightened that you might know what
[1:26:27] is the hope of his calling
[1:26:28] and what is the riches of his glory of
[1:26:31] his inheritance in the saints
[1:26:33] and what is exceeding greatness of his
[1:26:36] power to
[1:26:37] us word who believed according to the
[1:26:40] working of his mighty power
[1:26:41] which he wrought in christ when he
[1:26:43] raised him from the dead
[1:26:45] and set him in his own right hand in the
[1:26:48] heavenly places
[1:26:49] so he's showing you look what he did in
[1:26:51] christ
[1:26:52] he raised him from the dead and set him
[1:26:55] in the heavenlies
[1:26:57] this is what he does for you he has
[1:26:59] quickened you
[1:27:00] raised you with christ and has set you
[1:27:03] in the heavenlies
[1:27:08] and what's now far above
[1:27:14] all principalities did we read that in
[1:27:17] ephesians 6
[1:27:18] what we're fighting against he's already
[1:27:20] set you above it
[1:27:24] he's already made you rulers over those
[1:27:26] rulers
[1:27:27] come on now he gave you in mark 16 the
[1:27:30] authority to cast out satan
[1:27:34] to pull down your strongholds to take
[1:27:36] your promises
[1:27:38] amen so he said he set christ at his own
[1:27:42] right hand
[1:27:43] and he's just showing you what he did in
[1:27:44] christ he's going to do in you
[1:27:47] he said for above all principality and
[1:27:49] power
[1:27:50] and might and dominion and they ever
[1:27:52] named it his name
[1:27:53] now you just name it he said well it's
[1:27:56] cancer well
[1:27:56] you're you have dominion over cancer and
[1:27:59] when you say well
[1:28:00] it's it's a problem here it's he has you
[1:28:04] have
[1:28:04] dominion over that problem what did he
[1:28:07] say far above
[1:28:08] all principality and power and might and
[1:28:10] dominion and
[1:28:11] every name that is named
[1:28:14] not only in this world but also in that
[1:28:16] which is to come
[1:28:18] and it put all things under his feet
[1:28:22] and gave him to be the head over all
[1:28:25] things to the church
[1:28:26] we'll come back to this in a little bit
[1:28:29] if i can
[1:28:30] but anyway he put all things under his
[1:28:32] feet made him to be the head
[1:28:34] and he and over all things to the church
[1:28:37] which
[1:28:38] is his body so if it's under his feet
[1:28:43] and we are his body
[1:28:45] then he's under your feet is that right
[1:28:49] amen so he made him to be head or gave
[1:28:52] him preeminence over all things the
[1:28:54] church
[1:28:55] which is his body which is the fullness
[1:28:57] of him that filleth
[1:28:59] all and all and you
[1:29:03] now we just talked about christ let's
[1:29:05] talk about you
[1:29:07] and you hath he made alive
[1:29:11] who were dead in trespasses and sin
[1:29:14] wherein times past you walked according
[1:29:16] to the course of this world
[1:29:18] according to the prince of the power of
[1:29:20] the heir the spirit that now worketh in
[1:29:22] the children of disobedience
[1:29:24] among whom we also had the way we lived
[1:29:28] our manner of living our conversation in
[1:29:30] times past
[1:29:31] and the lusts of our flesh fulfilling
[1:29:34] the desires of our flesh and of the mind
[1:29:36] and we're by nature the children of
[1:29:39] wrath
[1:29:40] even as other but
[1:29:43] god who is rich in mercy
[1:29:46] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[1:29:49] even when we were dead and since
[1:29:53] he hath quickened us together
[1:29:56] with christ he had made us alive
[1:29:59] together
[1:30:00] with christ by grace you are saved
[1:30:03] and has raised us up together
[1:30:07] and made us sit together in heavenly
[1:30:10] places
[1:30:12] in christ jesus
[1:30:20] now he gave he gives you a position
[1:30:24] of authority but not only that
[1:30:27] just by representation
[1:30:30] just by representation tell you think
[1:30:32] about this morning
[1:30:34] we just had a we just had a great
[1:30:36] convention there in north carolina
[1:30:38] brother timothy was there
[1:30:41] as brother timothy ministered we were
[1:30:43] ministering
[1:30:45] even like tabernacle come on was there
[1:30:48] why because we had a representation
[1:30:51] there
[1:30:53] so we know when we have a man christ
[1:30:56] jesus
[1:30:57] who has been exalted to dominion
[1:31:00] and throne because that man is there all
[1:31:03] sons of god are there
[1:31:07] are you with me america went to the moon
[1:31:09] i
[1:31:10] didn't but we did
[1:31:13] is that right amen so we have been to
[1:31:15] the moon
[1:31:18] why because america went to the moon and
[1:31:21] we are america
[1:31:23] amen so christ went into the heavens we
[1:31:26] are in the heavens
[1:31:27] amen because a man went there the man
[1:31:30] christ jesus
[1:31:31] furthermore a man opened the seals
[1:31:35] a man took the book a man
[1:31:38] is in possession of the title and if
[1:31:41] that man is in
[1:31:42] possession of the title then all of his
[1:31:45] children
[1:31:45] are in possession of that title
[1:31:50] hallelujah now i won't make a badness
[1:31:53] out because they never understand that
[1:31:55] but i
[1:31:55] ought to make a message believers shout
[1:31:58] hallelujah
[1:31:59] because the seventh seal is open and the
[1:32:02] silence has been broken
[1:32:04] and our name has been shown in the book
[1:32:06] and a man there
[1:32:07] has claimed the inheritance and he
[1:32:10] claimed it for you
[1:32:11] and he claimed it from me and because he
[1:32:13] has it we have it
[1:32:15] [Applause]
[1:32:18] because he has it we have it because
[1:32:21] he's alive
[1:32:22] we're alive because he's enthroned we
[1:32:24] are enthralled
[1:32:25] because he's in power we're in power
[1:32:28] [Applause]
[1:32:35] and that gives us authority then to act
[1:32:37] in his name
[1:32:39] on the earth
[1:32:43] now we fight because we're in a
[1:32:45] spiritual battle
[1:32:47] it's not a flesh and blood affair
[1:32:49] although
[1:32:51] it really gets right down into flesh and
[1:32:54] blood
[1:32:55] [Music]
[1:32:56] amen because demons have invade your
[1:32:59] flesh
[1:33:00] and you feel like it's just a battle in
[1:33:03] your body but it's more than fleshly
[1:33:05] it's spiritual
[1:33:08] amen some of you are going through
[1:33:10] battles with cancer
[1:33:12] i'll tell you what is more than a
[1:33:14] physical battle
[1:33:16] it's a spiritual battle
[1:33:19] amen some of you are going to a battle
[1:33:22] with other
[1:33:23] things in your health and what is more
[1:33:25] than a physical
[1:33:27] you're looking at the physical jesus
[1:33:30] didn't look at the physical he looked at
[1:33:32] the spiritual
[1:33:35] is that right amen he called every
[1:33:37] sickness there whether it was
[1:33:39] epilepsy whether whatever it was he
[1:33:41] called it the devil
[1:33:43] didn't he a man if a man was crippled up
[1:33:46] if it was arthritis if it was paralytic
[1:33:48] he called it the devil
[1:33:51] he didn't deal with the flesh and the
[1:33:53] blood and man he didn't deal with it
[1:33:56] he you know he didn't go to with the
[1:33:58] woman there with the blood issue and fix
[1:34:00] the blood issue
[1:34:01] he do what he dealt dealt with the
[1:34:03] spirit that was troubling her
[1:34:05] and when the enemy was gone she was
[1:34:07] healed
[1:34:09] are you with me now satan is a squatter
[1:34:12] because he he is its perverter
[1:34:16] and this earth is under a curse
[1:34:20] remember the earth was cursed with man
[1:34:25] and and remember also your body is earth
[1:34:30] your body is just the bible said the
[1:34:33] lord god formed man out of the dust
[1:34:36] of the ground and we are destined to
[1:34:38] return
[1:34:39] to the ground because for out of it that
[1:34:42] was taken
[1:34:43] for just our heart and unto death shalt
[1:34:46] thou return
[1:34:47] you remember that amen genesis 2 17
[1:34:51] curse it is the ground for thy sake in
[1:34:53] sorrow thou shalt eat of it all the days
[1:34:56] of thy life
[1:34:57] thorns also and thistles shall it bring
[1:34:59] forth to thee and thou shalt eat of the
[1:35:01] herb of the field so they're there again
[1:35:04] there again we we know the the ground
[1:35:08] is cursed now
[1:35:11] jesus as the word
[1:35:15] became flesh and took on dust
[1:35:20] he took that dust body down to the river
[1:35:23] jordan and it was baptized
[1:35:26] and filled with the holy ghost same
[1:35:28] thing you got to do with yours
[1:35:30] you take your dust body down to the
[1:35:33] altar
[1:35:35] surrender to god and say here lord i
[1:35:37] give it
[1:35:39] come possess this vessel you're baptized
[1:35:42] in his name
[1:35:43] meaning he it now belongs to him amen
[1:35:46] what is he doing claiming
[1:35:48] your earth for the resurrection
[1:35:52] is that right now so that jesus
[1:35:55] as the word became flesh took on dust
[1:35:58] and redeemed that part of dust
[1:36:02] by his blood and payment for sin so he
[1:36:05] could redeem
[1:36:06] your body as brother branham explained
[1:36:09] it and proven his word and
[1:36:11] and uh i think it was a future home he
[1:36:14] said
[1:36:14] and goes there he said he took that
[1:36:17] cursed
[1:36:18] earth and took it down to the river
[1:36:22] jordan
[1:36:23] and had it baptized in obedience
[1:36:27] come on amen and it was filled with the
[1:36:29] holy spirit and he said
[1:36:31] from this part of the earth i have
[1:36:33] redeemed
[1:36:35] i'm going to redeem the rest of it
[1:36:39] i'll redeem every other one i'm going to
[1:36:41] redeem the whole earth
[1:36:44] hallelujah if you look toward the future
[1:36:47] we're not going to get a new earth in
[1:36:49] the sense that god's going to just
[1:36:50] create a a complete new thing any he
[1:36:54] it will pass from one form to another
[1:36:57] it will be clean stuff and just like he
[1:37:00] washed it off
[1:37:01] with water at with noah and baptize your
[1:37:04] world with water shed his blood up on it
[1:37:07] with
[1:37:07] calvary and then he will baptize it with
[1:37:09] fire come on somebody
[1:37:11] and what will he do he will make it a
[1:37:14] dwelling place for him to live on
[1:37:16] the earth will be redeemed your body is
[1:37:20] also for redemption
[1:37:25] now divine healing is the earnest
[1:37:29] of the resurrection in other words the
[1:37:32] earnest of your body
[1:37:34] change it just simply shows if god can
[1:37:37] heal a body
[1:37:38] amen he can heal the whole body amen
[1:37:42] so divine healing is the earnest of the
[1:37:44] resurrection
[1:37:46] and salvation is claiming your body
[1:37:50] by placing the deposit of god's own life
[1:37:53] within it
[1:37:54] that's the holy ghost the holy ghost is
[1:37:57] a deposit
[1:37:58] until the fullness comes it's a down
[1:38:02] payment amen on on
[1:38:05] your new body and eternal life so you
[1:38:08] see
[1:38:09] it's not it's not the end result it's
[1:38:11] just
[1:38:12] the deposit amen so through redemption
[1:38:16] i want you i'm going to get some some
[1:38:19] some things nailed down here for you now
[1:38:22] through redemption
[1:38:23] your body now belongs to god
[1:38:27] and it is his temple
[1:38:31] your body does not belong to satan
[1:38:35] your body is god's body to dwell in
[1:38:39] and to operate through amen
[1:38:42] first corinthians 6 19 do you not know
[1:38:45] your body is a temple of the holy spirit
[1:38:47] who is in you
[1:38:48] whom you've received from god you're not
[1:38:50] your own
[1:38:52] you have been bought for with a price
[1:38:54] therefore glorify
[1:38:56] god with your body now what was he
[1:38:59] telling him in that verse
[1:39:00] he was telling don't yield yourself to
[1:39:02] sin and unbelief and
[1:39:04] fornication and so on don't yield your
[1:39:06] body to sin but he's making it clear
[1:39:08] your body is the temple of the holy
[1:39:12] ghost
[1:39:13] who that that is in you that you receive
[1:39:15] from god and you're not your own
[1:39:19] you're bought with a price i'm just
[1:39:21] reminding god right now god this is your
[1:39:23] body
[1:39:25] amen it's your body satan has no right
[1:39:28] to squat in it
[1:39:31] he has no claim on this body it is not
[1:39:34] his body
[1:39:36] amen my hands are not yielded to the
[1:39:39] devil's work
[1:39:40] and man i no longer yield my members to
[1:39:42] sin that's romans 6.
[1:39:44] amen but i yield them to god and my
[1:39:48] my voice is to praise him amen is not to
[1:39:51] murmur and complain it is to praise him
[1:39:56] and my voice is to speak the word
[1:39:59] not the devil's lies amen my
[1:40:02] mind is for god to occupy not for the
[1:40:06] devil to occupy come on
[1:40:08] my body is for health to radiant not for
[1:40:12] sickness to reign in
[1:40:14] amen the bible said in first corinthians
[1:40:17] 3 16
[1:40:18] do you not know that your selves are
[1:40:20] god's temple and that the god spirit
[1:40:22] dwells in you
[1:40:24] you see satan is not the original owner
[1:40:26] of your body
[1:40:27] he's not the original owner of the earth
[1:40:30] amen he is not the creator of our bodies
[1:40:35] but he is its perverter
[1:40:38] and we are in a fallen condition so we
[1:40:42] are not in our original immortal
[1:40:45] condition
[1:40:47] now in this fallen condition we get
[1:40:50] attacked
[1:40:51] with demonic sicknesses over and over
[1:40:55] again
[1:40:56] until we die
[1:40:59] why because from dust our heart to dust
[1:41:02] thou shalt return
[1:41:05] our bodies still grow
[1:41:09] thorns and thistles disease
[1:41:12] and afflictions you know why should i
[1:41:16] as a child of god have this it ain't
[1:41:18] because you're a child of god
[1:41:20] it's because of the fall
[1:41:23] and because it is in perverted form then
[1:41:26] satan comes with
[1:41:27] buffett after buffett warned after war
[1:41:31] until finally your purpose is fulfilled
[1:41:34] in life
[1:41:34] and you depart from this into where
[1:41:37] there is no war
[1:41:39] but however because of the atonement i'm
[1:41:41] going to get something here
[1:41:43] because of the atonement the word of
[1:41:46] faith will rebuild tissue in your body
[1:41:50] that these disease these demons have
[1:41:52] torn down
[1:41:54] amen now our combat is not with the
[1:41:57] physical things
[1:41:59] but with spiritual things our enemies
[1:42:02] are spirits
[1:42:05] they're not flesh and blood they are
[1:42:07] spirits
[1:42:08] the diseases that afflict man are
[1:42:11] spiritual
[1:42:13] amen we have been given power through
[1:42:15] the name of jesus
[1:42:16] to cast them out through the name not
[1:42:19] because
[1:42:20] it has magic powers but because that
[1:42:23] name
[1:42:23] represents the atonement for the payment
[1:42:26] for our redemption
[1:42:28] and jesus triumph over death hell and
[1:42:31] the grave
[1:42:32] so we use that name saying satan you got
[1:42:35] to back off
[1:42:36] because jesus paid for this
[1:42:40] it gives us title to every promise now
[1:42:43] diseases are demon spirits who like
[1:42:46] their master
[1:42:48] seeks satan six bodies to do harm in
[1:42:52] they come to dwell in order to do harm
[1:42:54] they're like a thief they come to
[1:42:56] rob and to kill and destroy and all
[1:43:00] all bodies whether you're christians or
[1:43:01] not where they are
[1:43:03] vulnerable to satan's invasion because
[1:43:06] of the fall
[1:43:08] amount now these demons these dark
[1:43:12] shadows we spoke about them last sunday
[1:43:15] which you know with them sinners they
[1:43:17] use their bodies to do their dirty work
[1:43:21] you know you once done satan's dirty
[1:43:23] work
[1:43:24] you were once sometimes darkness
[1:43:27] is that right your way that you live was
[1:43:30] according to the prince of the power
[1:43:32] of atmosphere that one that ruled the
[1:43:35] atmosphere of your body
[1:43:37] of your life and you you
[1:43:40] you went and yielded your members to sin
[1:43:43] to do wrong amen
[1:43:46] remember when jesus comes in you yield
[1:43:49] it to him
[1:43:50] that's why these hands raise up and
[1:43:52] praise god
[1:43:53] that's why this mouth declares his word
[1:43:55] is the truth
[1:43:56] amen that's why this body now obeys the
[1:44:00] word of god
[1:44:00] rather than the law of sin are you with
[1:44:04] me
[1:44:04] but you know satan then will use um
[1:44:07] will use these as you know these
[1:44:10] centered they're
[1:44:11] they're like missionaries who do his
[1:44:14] dirty work
[1:44:15] they use their power to defile to
[1:44:17] destroy to abuse others
[1:44:19] um they satan use these defiled ones
[1:44:22] like i said as
[1:44:23] as a missionary to defile other innocent
[1:44:26] people
[1:44:28] and now that's the influence of sinners
[1:44:30] they spread their darkness
[1:44:32] through their words through their
[1:44:35] behavior
[1:44:36] through their dress through their deeds
[1:44:39] they spread their darkness
[1:44:41] but god also uses human instruments
[1:44:45] a man anointed and filled by the holy
[1:44:47] ghost to bless
[1:44:49] to inspire to encourage others who need
[1:44:52] god's help
[1:44:53] [Applause]
[1:44:55] amen once i was satan's missionary
[1:44:58] i was his embassary but now i am god's
[1:45:01] ambassador
[1:45:02] and we are ambassadors for christ i
[1:45:05] represent him
[1:45:06] i represent a different kingdom amen and
[1:45:09] i'm here to bless
[1:45:10] to inspire to encourage everyone
[1:45:14] amen that you can be an overcomer you
[1:45:17] can rise out of the realm you are
[1:45:19] there is a higher place for you to swap
[1:45:25] but you know with all the demons and all
[1:45:28] of their ugliness and all of their
[1:45:29] filthiness and all their
[1:45:31] their scariness they're not to be feared
[1:45:35] the weakest somebody say weakest
[1:45:40] the weakest of christian can use god's
[1:45:43] word to cast
[1:45:44] them out
[1:45:44] [Applause]
[1:45:51] you got more authority in heaven than
[1:45:53] any angel even those that didn't fall
[1:45:58] so you certainly have authority over
[1:46:00] satanic spirits
[1:46:04] and the weakest of christian that's why
[1:46:07] that's why let the wheat say i'm strong
[1:46:12] why because the weak as a christian can
[1:46:14] use god's word to cast satan out
[1:46:18] and when people fear they are
[1:46:21] demons because they don't understand
[1:46:23] their own position
[1:46:26] they've never heard or don't realize
[1:46:29] about
[1:46:30] their legal defeat by jesus christ
[1:46:33] that at calvary every devil
[1:46:37] was defeated legally satan has no more
[1:46:41] right to you
[1:46:43] is that right amen well in fact of the
[1:46:46] matter the taking of the book of title
[1:46:48] that we was talking about
[1:46:49] the opening of his seals is the triumph
[1:46:53] of the bloody lamb who opens us all the
[1:46:56] possibilities within the book
[1:47:01] so we need not live below our privileges
[1:47:05] the ownership of our inheritance has
[1:47:08] never been more sure
[1:47:11] amen now satan brings his darkness
[1:47:16] he brings his atmospheres you notice
[1:47:19] with sickness
[1:47:20] comes an atmosphere
[1:47:25] with sickness comes a tormenting spirit
[1:47:30] amen that you know i've often said you
[1:47:33] know i can take
[1:47:34] i can take anybody any child anybody
[1:47:38] and i can put my finger on a wart and
[1:47:41] command that wart to leave
[1:47:43] and with two or three weeks you know
[1:47:45] it'll be gone
[1:47:48] and man i remember i think it was esther
[1:47:50] you know one
[1:47:51] one time when she was a young girl you
[1:47:53] know she she had one of those
[1:47:55] on her on her finger had a ward on her
[1:47:57] finger and i said
[1:47:59] i said wait a minute let me just put my
[1:48:01] my finger on that thing
[1:48:03] i said i curse it in the name of the
[1:48:04] lord about three weeks later
[1:48:07] she told me he said daddy that thing's
[1:48:08] still here i said esther
[1:48:12] i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you
[1:48:13] one more time
[1:48:15] i cursed that thing in the lord now
[1:48:16] don't you look at it
[1:48:18] don't you worry about it you don't pay
[1:48:19] it no attention and in three weeks it'll
[1:48:22] be gone
[1:48:24] three weeks later the thing was gone
[1:48:27] now listen that is a
[1:48:30] life that builds a little tumor
[1:48:33] or little swelling little body for it to
[1:48:37] live in
[1:48:39] now medically you would go and take an
[1:48:42] acid or something or get them to burn it
[1:48:44] off
[1:48:44] you know with that by the way you know
[1:48:47] uh
[1:48:47] doctors do that remember when when um in
[1:48:50] that
[1:48:51] great move of god we had little jed i
[1:48:54] think four or five years old at the time
[1:48:56] maybe three four years old
[1:48:58] had over over a hundred warts on his
[1:49:01] little body
[1:49:02] and and and they the doctor had
[1:49:06] burned like a nearly uh
[1:49:09] nearly 100 off and there was still
[1:49:12] hundreds more
[1:49:13] and he said there's so many i can't burn
[1:49:15] them off at one time
[1:49:16] it'll just cause too much distress on
[1:49:18] the child so
[1:49:19] what we'll do is you come back for
[1:49:21] another treatment
[1:49:23] see brother mother brought him through
[1:49:24] the prayer line that night
[1:49:26] and we prayed for that child amen
[1:49:30] cursed the thing in the name of the lord
[1:49:33] and the next
[1:49:33] you know right in the next few days
[1:49:35] every wart was gone
[1:49:37] totally gone why because
[1:49:41] the name of jesus takes preeminence
[1:49:44] the power of god takes preeminence over
[1:49:47] every spirit
[1:49:48] now that ward has no more power
[1:49:52] than a cancer it also is a growth
[1:49:56] it gets in the body but you know with it
[1:49:58] comes a spirit of fear
[1:50:03] there's no fear with war if i have it if
[1:50:06] i live with it
[1:50:07] you know if i die with it you know and
[1:50:09] when i die i still got it
[1:50:11] it's it's not gonna matter i it's just a
[1:50:13] wart
[1:50:14] it's a ugly it's unsightly it kind of
[1:50:17] gets bumped once away but it's no big
[1:50:19] deal
[1:50:21] but then you look at cancer and cancer
[1:50:23] comes along and it had got no more power
[1:50:25] than the wart
[1:50:31] all devils are powerless
[1:50:35] before the name of jesus whether a wart
[1:50:38] or a cancer
[1:50:42] but with that cancer comes another
[1:50:44] spirit
[1:50:45] that's a spirit of fear that begins to
[1:50:48] work
[1:50:49] and is always hounding at your ear
[1:50:54] it's going to take your life it's going
[1:50:56] to destroy you
[1:50:57] look how it makes you feel and you get
[1:50:59] down in the sense about knowledge
[1:51:03] and what you ought to do is ignore the
[1:51:04] thing and walk on
[1:51:06] god said i'm healed i'm not going to
[1:51:09] look
[1:51:09] at the symptoms no more i'm looking to a
[1:51:11] divine promise keeping my mind on the
[1:51:13] divine promise
[1:51:15] i can only have peace when my mind has
[1:51:17] stayed on him
[1:51:18] now see but you see he is the prince
[1:51:22] of the power of air that's again a
[1:51:26] heavenly atmosphere he is has
[1:51:29] power over heaven over
[1:51:33] over the air prince of power the air a
[1:51:36] heavenly realm
[1:51:37] and satan brother branham said is always
[1:51:40] near to get
[1:51:41] something fumbled up in your mind
[1:51:45] even brother branham would would have
[1:51:47] trouble with that because satan would be
[1:51:49] there
[1:51:50] every time he was in discernment
[1:51:55] and he said you know in one prayer line
[1:51:57] he said and there comes
[1:51:59] there comes a a thought from another
[1:52:02] realm
[1:52:04] and he said it's not from god you only
[1:52:07] guessed that
[1:52:09] but i'm going to prove to you satan i
[1:52:11] didn't guess that
[1:52:12] and he goes on one more time after over
[1:52:14] and over and over and over
[1:52:15] until the woman's faith is raised and
[1:52:18] she's healed
[1:52:21] amen now because because
[1:52:24] satan is always there to get something
[1:52:26] fumbled up in your mind
[1:52:29] even in the service like this morning
[1:52:31] he's right there to fumble something up
[1:52:33] in your mind
[1:52:36] he's there to get you distracted get you
[1:52:38] pulled off get your wander
[1:52:40] get your get your fear and get you down
[1:52:44] get you questioning rather than
[1:52:46] believing
[1:52:47] he's always stirring up the atmospheres
[1:52:50] as the prince of the power of the air
[1:52:53] he is called he's always trying to cause
[1:52:55] you to disbelieve
[1:52:57] and lose faith
[1:53:01] you see when you lose faith you've
[1:53:03] disbelieved the word
[1:53:05] your weapon that's your weapon right
[1:53:08] and you're dishonored without the word
[1:53:12] none of us can stand against the devil
[1:53:15] amen faith is the hand that holds the
[1:53:18] sword
[1:53:19] of the word of god now
[1:53:22] look in the sword it's sharp
[1:53:26] it can cut it can cut through the
[1:53:29] darkness and say the
[1:53:31] most wretched center like we heard
[1:53:33] brother wendell's testimony wins tonight
[1:53:35] wasn't that wonderful
[1:53:37] the most wretched couple of heron and
[1:53:39] addicts and
[1:53:40] and horrible conditions
[1:53:43] come on amen but the the sword
[1:53:46] the sword can cut all the way through
[1:53:49] the darkness
[1:53:50] to bring someone like that salvation
[1:53:54] amen amen it can bring healing to
[1:53:57] well i don't care how desperate it is i
[1:54:00] mean how bad the situation was how bad
[1:54:04] the cancer was and
[1:54:05] how awful the symptoms and the what you
[1:54:08] know
[1:54:08] the word of god can cut a hole all the
[1:54:10] way through there
[1:54:12] bring the light of god's glory hey man
[1:54:16] destroy that thing are you with me amen
[1:54:19] but
[1:54:20] faith is the hand that holds
[1:54:24] the sword
[1:54:27] so it is no more the word of god is
[1:54:30] no more effective than your faith
[1:54:34] so a weak hand can only cut just a
[1:54:37] little hole no matter how
[1:54:38] cold how sharp the sword is oh it's
[1:54:42] subdued kingdoms
[1:54:43] it overcome fires it delivered them from
[1:54:46] prisons
[1:54:48] come on faith faith gave abraham a child
[1:54:52] after
[1:54:52] she was barren for he was let's say
[1:54:54] we're two young people
[1:54:56] amen faith faith will do a mighty thing
[1:54:59] but there's got to be a strong hand of
[1:55:01] faith
[1:55:02] the word of god is powerful amen
[1:55:06] but the sword it is only as powerful as
[1:55:09] the hand that holds the sword
[1:55:11] and the hand is faith now so he's always
[1:55:15] trying to
[1:55:16] get you to disbelieve and and weaken
[1:55:20] your arm of faith
[1:55:24] he can't weaken the word
[1:55:27] so he weakens your faith so his attack
[1:55:31] is against the your faith in the promise
[1:55:36] now so faith is the hand that holds the
[1:55:38] sword the word of god
[1:55:40] a weak hand can cut a hole through the
[1:55:42] darkness
[1:55:43] amen and satan will come and attack your
[1:55:46] faith because
[1:55:47] he knows without faith
[1:55:51] you can't please god
[1:56:00] he knows your doubt
[1:56:04] pushes god away
[1:56:09] now the the battles in the heavens
[1:56:12] michael i mean gabriel's trying to get
[1:56:14] to you tell you
[1:56:15] you're greatly loved and here's the
[1:56:18] revelation for your need
[1:56:21] amen but here's this war that is
[1:56:23] happening back and forth in the heavenly
[1:56:27] and daniel must not give up
[1:56:31] because if he gives up the battle is
[1:56:33] lost
[1:56:40] now
[1:56:43] there's where sight and time
[1:56:46] is god's worst enemy in divine healing
[1:56:52] somebody say that with me sight and time
[1:56:56] god's worst enemies
[1:57:02] sight is not faith
[1:57:07] huh faith don't need sight
[1:57:13] faith is the evidence
[1:57:16] of what you are hoping for you don't
[1:57:19] need
[1:57:20] sight to give you evidence you need
[1:57:22] faith to give you evidence
[1:57:24] faith is the evidence of what you are
[1:57:28] believing for
[1:57:29] or hoping for now so sight
[1:57:33] is not faith is an enemy to faith but
[1:57:36] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:57:38] for it's the evidence of things we can't
[1:57:40] see
[1:57:40] now like brother wendell said wednesday
[1:57:42] night faith don't look at a calendar
[1:57:46] or a watch it looks at the word and the
[1:57:48] word is eternal
[1:57:51] so it's not looking at time it's not
[1:57:53] looking at the calendar well we've been
[1:57:55] praying
[1:57:56] we've been believing for so many days no
[1:57:58] you're not looking at time
[1:58:00] you're looking at the promise
[1:58:03] well it's we've waited too long you know
[1:58:06] no
[1:58:06] we're not we've not waited too long
[1:58:08] we're not looking at time
[1:58:10] we're looking at the promise well but
[1:58:13] things don't aren't any different than
[1:58:15] they were yesterday
[1:58:16] but we're not looking by sight we are
[1:58:19] looking
[1:58:20] at what the word said and the word said
[1:58:22] the mountain's moving
[1:58:24] even if i can't tell it with my sight
[1:58:27] [Applause]
[1:58:30] now the second miracle brother branham
[1:58:32] said as i told you before many
[1:58:34] times in time in sight issue is the
[1:58:36] worst enemies god has
[1:58:38] time and sight you look and neither one
[1:58:41] of them declares
[1:58:42] anything about god you want it
[1:58:45] done spontaneously when god takes his
[1:58:48] time about things
[1:58:49] let's just believe whatever's said is
[1:58:52] that right
[1:58:54] because you believe what you s
[1:58:57] but but the reason is the enemy because
[1:58:59] you believe what you
[1:59:00] see rather than look at the unseen
[1:59:04] where the battle's being fought
[1:59:08] so you know you're looking here and
[1:59:10] you're seeing your problem
[1:59:11] but you're not looking at the unseen and
[1:59:14] you see them there
[1:59:15] all of heaven is doing everything to get
[1:59:18] to you
[1:59:21] there's a war going on
[1:59:25] and all of heaven is moving on your
[1:59:27] behalf
[1:59:28] don't give up on it don't quit and
[1:59:32] surrender
[1:59:35] and then press on i mean when
[1:59:38] the when the tough you know when the
[1:59:41] going gets tough the tough gets going
[1:59:44] you press back harder
[1:59:47] i mean you hang on to that promise
[1:59:50] everybody
[1:59:51] you you look here you know and you
[1:59:56] see this final you looking boy here
[1:59:59] timothy
[2:00:00] stand up timothy hey man this specimen
[2:00:03] of arts ain't he
[2:00:06] you look over here and you see you know
[2:00:09] he's got a black shirt on
[2:00:13] he doesn't
[2:00:16] he's got a black shirt on that's a black
[2:00:19] shirt
[2:00:22] what color you think it is brother
[2:00:30] brother tommy what do you think it is
[2:00:32] it's yellow
[2:00:34] you see your sight tells you that's
[2:00:37] yellow
[2:00:38] i can't convince you
[2:00:42] that it's black because that's a yellow
[2:00:44] shirt
[2:00:46] now faith looks at the promise
[2:00:50] thank you faith looks at the promise and
[2:00:54] you believe
[2:00:55] you know your you know what god's word
[2:00:57] said
[2:00:58] amen and you believe it just as firmly
[2:01:01] as you believe
[2:01:02] that shirt's a yellow search why your
[2:01:05] sight
[2:01:06] tells you it's yellow somebody else says
[2:01:09] blue
[2:01:09] is black it's purple it's this it's that
[2:01:11] is the other and you say no it's yellow
[2:01:13] it's yellow it's yellow it's yellow
[2:01:16] why because your sight tells you so and
[2:01:18] when your
[2:01:19] faith anchors in the word of god the
[2:01:21] doctor says this
[2:01:22] my medicine did that the problem said
[2:01:24] that remember he says this
[2:01:26] somebody else died with that your blood
[2:01:29] your word said
[2:01:30] amen your sight of faith
[2:01:33] amen your faith sin says god's word is
[2:01:36] true
[2:01:37] and you can't convince me that is
[2:01:39] black
[2:01:40] [Applause]
[2:01:48] now
[2:01:51] faith is a substance of things
[2:01:54] hoped for faith is the evidence of
[2:01:58] things you don't see take smell or hear
[2:02:01] it's another sense it's in another realm
[2:02:04] you don't fight this battle with census
[2:02:07] you fight this battle with faith
[2:02:13] now so you know
[2:02:16] you know just like brother elle said
[2:02:18] well if you say it's black i'll say it's
[2:02:20] black
[2:02:21] that's what we do with the doctor
[2:02:26] that's what we say with the skeptics
[2:02:30] well you see it's black man the world
[2:02:32] all says it's black
[2:02:34] and everybody else is saying is black
[2:02:36] must be black i must be wrong
[2:02:39] but you see faith has got to anchor in
[2:02:42] the word of god
[2:02:44] and the word is right i've seen what the
[2:02:46] word
[2:02:47] said therefore i will not
[2:02:50] believe the lie of the devil
[2:02:54] when the devil tells me something
[2:02:55] contrary against the word of god
[2:02:58] i don't care what my sight says my
[2:03:01] feeling says
[2:03:02] my hearing says the word said
[2:03:05] i am healed
[2:03:11] hallelujah the word said i'm leading
[2:03:13] this battle
[2:03:14] the word said i'm an overcomer the word
[2:03:18] said hallelujah
[2:03:21] what did the word say
[2:03:28] i don't care if the preacher says some
[2:03:31] shirt is black
[2:03:32] i don't care if they say these are
[2:03:34] miracles or past
[2:03:35] i don't care if they deny every promise
[2:03:38] of the word
[2:03:39] you're gonna say that shirt is yellow
[2:03:43] [Applause]
[2:03:48] i'm not going to believe what anybody
[2:03:50] circumstances anything
[2:03:52] else what my sight says my hearing says
[2:03:55] what the
[2:03:56] doctor said what science says
[2:03:59] i'm going to believe what the word said
[2:04:05] because faith is a sense that looks out
[2:04:09] only in god's word and it says god's
[2:04:12] word is
[2:04:13] true
[2:04:14] [Applause]
[2:04:19] hallelujah now you can't have anything
[2:04:22] from god only by faith
[2:04:24] by faith the walls of jericho fell down
[2:04:28] come on who would have thought a shout
[2:04:30] would bring the walls down
[2:04:32] amen but faith brought it down by faith
[2:04:35] moses refused to be called the son of
[2:04:37] pharaoh's daughter
[2:04:38] by faith gideon there took his promise
[2:04:42] with 300 men
[2:04:43] he with the he whipped the midianites
[2:04:46] without faith it is impossible
[2:04:49] to please god and if you want to please
[2:04:51] him you must come to him with
[2:04:53] faith believing his word is true
[2:05:00] now if you're doctors you're absolute
[2:05:02] you'll take what the doctor said
[2:05:04] if the preacher say absolute you'll take
[2:05:06] what he said but you've got to take the
[2:05:08] word as you're absolute
[2:05:11] now brother branham said about that
[2:05:14] in leading of the spirit he said the
[2:05:16] little lady sitting right there
[2:05:18] second one from the back there she's
[2:05:20] bothered with nervousness
[2:05:22] and that right lady see what i mean that
[2:05:24] demon knows
[2:05:28] that demon knows if that woman will
[2:05:30] halfway believe
[2:05:32] oh god amen we'll have halfway believe
[2:05:36] that jesus christ
[2:05:37] the son of god and i'm his prophet
[2:05:39] that'll have to leave her
[2:05:42] and that demon is calling to that one
[2:05:44] for help to help
[2:05:45] for help to accumulate unbelief but he's
[2:05:48] lost
[2:05:48] the battle he sure had because faith
[2:05:52] is gathering hallelujah
[2:05:56] amen come on now there's only one thing
[2:05:59] that's going to happen with the attack
[2:06:01] of the devil
[2:06:02] we're not getting weaker we're getting
[2:06:05] stronger
[2:06:06] [Applause]
[2:06:10] now what would satan do when he was
[2:06:12] exposed
[2:06:13] those demons of cancer arthritis other
[2:06:17] kinds it would scream and how and
[2:06:19] calling other demons to congregate and
[2:06:21] create an atmosphere of unbelief
[2:06:24] because satan is a prince of atmospheres
[2:06:27] you see brother branham said in the
[2:06:29] future home all the sin that's in the
[2:06:31] heavens above
[2:06:32] he is the prince of the power of the air
[2:06:35] he keeps off
[2:06:36] or wars off the blessings from god so
[2:06:39] there he is
[2:06:41] you know controlling atmospheres and
[2:06:44] he's trying to
[2:06:44] keep you from the blessings
[2:06:47] amen in there comes thunderbolts of
[2:06:50] lightning
[2:06:51] and strike the earth amen
[2:06:55] amen now don't let that bother you
[2:06:58] brother l you're going to be going
[2:06:59] all the way back to the doctor again and
[2:07:01] what are you going to do you're going to
[2:07:02] say what the word said
[2:07:04] because you're going to believe what
[2:07:05] god's word said not what the doctor says
[2:07:10] right amen amen so don't let that
[2:07:13] discourage you you know you answered
[2:07:15] just
[2:07:15] exactly according to the plan of god
[2:07:17] predestinated for this sermon this
[2:07:18] morning
[2:07:19] smile and be glad god used his part of
[2:07:22] the sermon
[2:07:23] amen so just in the natural the
[2:07:26] atmosphere is stirred up until there
[2:07:29] comes sheets of
[2:07:30] slicing rain and violet winds and
[2:07:33] typhoons and storms
[2:07:34] and even so satan disrupts the
[2:07:37] atmospheres
[2:07:38] in your life and mine
[2:07:42] that's what he's been trying to do to me
[2:07:45] do you know
[2:07:46] disrupt the atmosphere i'll be down
[2:07:49] and depressed and oh memory you know
[2:07:52] somebody else went through this and it
[2:07:53] didn't have a good outcome in this and
[2:07:55] all the other yeah and the yak of the
[2:07:58] devil
[2:07:59] he gets in your ear how many has had him
[2:08:02] in your ear this week
[2:08:04] i'm glad you know it was the devil amen
[2:08:07] because that is half of the victory
[2:08:09] right there
[2:08:10] it just know who's talking
[2:08:12] [Applause]
[2:08:15] amen there's another voice that is said
[2:08:17] from the word i am a son of god
[2:08:19] i have been commissioned i have been
[2:08:21] called i've been elected
[2:08:23] and i have placed for this hour and this
[2:08:26] time that's the reason i'm here
[2:08:31] it comes with storms slices of rain
[2:08:35] thunder real noise satan is there
[2:08:39] sitting in the seat of authority where
[2:08:41] man what set
[2:08:43] controlling the atmosphere is the earth
[2:08:45] once well man
[2:08:46] adam would once bring peace upon the
[2:08:48] earth
[2:08:49] satan is there stirring up war strife
[2:08:52] afflicting man
[2:08:53] as a tormentor with storms and lightning
[2:08:56] famine
[2:08:56] and disease satan then brings his wars
[2:09:01] down to the earth
[2:09:02] causing disruption in the cells of your
[2:09:05] body
[2:09:06] and you're you know there starts a war
[2:09:08] in your body
[2:09:10] i mean those of you that are are dealing
[2:09:13] with afflictions today
[2:09:14] there's a war going on amen
[2:09:18] you know in the cells of your body that
[2:09:20] war starts in your body
[2:09:22] as a cancer or other disease or sickness
[2:09:25] and it begins to conquer and destroy
[2:09:29] he's a thief he comes to rob
[2:09:32] and to kill and destroy now brother
[2:09:35] branham said it was a backswing cell
[2:09:37] that cancer gets into unfortunately the
[2:09:40] older we get the more backsliders we
[2:09:42] have
[2:09:45] amen in our body ourselves go to
[2:09:47] backsliding on us
[2:09:48] they ain't going forward i ain't getting
[2:09:50] younger i ain't prettier
[2:09:53] well i never was but handsomer wasn't
[2:09:55] much of that either
[2:09:57] but nevertheless you know it's
[2:10:00] starts going down i won't talk about you
[2:10:02] this time
[2:10:04] brother kenny didn't come so i could
[2:10:05] talk about him
[2:10:07] give him my apologies amen
[2:10:11] god bless you brother kenny you're going
[2:10:13] to be young again one day
[2:10:15] amen but even now even now we can have
[2:10:19] divine healing
[2:10:21] even now arthritic spirits should be
[2:10:23] cast out
[2:10:24] even now god can create and re recreate
[2:10:28] spines and bring things back even now
[2:10:32] we don't have to wait for a resurrection
[2:10:33] we can have it now
[2:10:35] [Applause]
[2:10:37] hallelujah so he said now let's just
[2:10:40] diagnose it for a moment he said
[2:10:43] now let's have let's bring you down one
[2:10:45] cell after the other
[2:10:46] one cell after the other and finally you
[2:10:48] get down to one
[2:10:49] little germ in other words he's pushed
[2:10:51] back all the cells and you finally come
[2:10:53] back to
[2:10:53] one little germ and what is that germ
[2:10:57] he said i break down that germ down now
[2:11:00] find out
[2:11:00] germa is a teeny little cell small as
[2:11:02] celery is it
[2:11:04] it can be seen because it's a natural
[2:11:06] part but it's the last thing a light and
[2:11:07] the glass can reflect there's a teeny
[2:11:09] little
[2:11:10] cell of a germ and some of them are so
[2:11:12] small a microscope can't pick it up
[2:11:15] well then the germ is alive and if we go
[2:11:18] beyond the last cell then you got life
[2:11:21] and then comes into the spirit realm
[2:11:25] so he says go back beyond the corrupt
[2:11:27] cells
[2:11:28] and you come to find out where it
[2:11:30] started from was a germ that started
[2:11:32] multiplying
[2:11:34] and then you you break past the germ and
[2:11:36] you find there's a life
[2:11:38] in that germ did you know when brother
[2:11:40] ron
[2:11:41] spencer went for um a biopsy
[2:11:45] in his lungs do you know that the
[2:11:47] technician as he's done it
[2:11:49] he's he says you know he said i've been
[2:11:51] reaching trying to get a piece of
[2:11:53] one of those he said but they keep
[2:11:55] moving away from me he said their
[2:11:56] life and they keep dodging the needle
[2:12:05] their life that's what science is saying
[2:12:09] and he said we go back beyond the last
[2:12:11] cell then you get a life
[2:12:14] and that goes into it comes in the
[2:12:15] spirit realm
[2:12:17] and he said just as you grew in the womb
[2:12:19] of your mother a cancer grows in your
[2:12:21] body
[2:12:23] and he said what caused the cancer well
[2:12:25] maybe a bruise will cause a cancer and
[2:12:27] those little cells
[2:12:28] when they're bruised now that bruise can
[2:12:30] become environmentally it can come by
[2:12:32] a chemical it could be covered by the
[2:12:34] food that you ate or
[2:12:35] some dye in there it could be anything
[2:12:37] that would corrupt the sale
[2:12:41] and and he says then that little sale
[2:12:43] when it's proven to be in the backslide
[2:12:46] gives a perfect place then for the devil
[2:12:49] to give in
[2:12:51] a backslidden cell you get a backslider
[2:12:53] in the church he's going to bruise the
[2:12:54] whole body
[2:12:56] if you don't watch but that cell
[2:12:58] backslide is bruised up he said now your
[2:13:00] doctor
[2:13:00] he can tell you about your body your
[2:13:02] anatomy but my work is in the realm of
[2:13:05] spirits
[2:13:06] so i'm not dealing with the lump that's
[2:13:08] where i live
[2:13:09] the most of my time he says is in
[2:13:11] another dimension
[2:13:13] that the world knows nothing about and
[2:13:15] he said now
[2:13:16] i can't heal nobody i never healed a
[2:13:18] person
[2:13:19] i'll never heal a person no one else did
[2:13:21] god said i'm the
[2:13:22] lord that heals all thy diseases
[2:13:26] then all hospital cases that's divine
[2:13:30] healing any healing that would come
[2:13:33] any way at all has to come from god or
[2:13:35] god told something that was wrong
[2:13:36] it's god amen
[2:13:40] well you know somebody we we claim
[2:13:42] divine healing so well
[2:13:44] somebody said well that you had some
[2:13:45] medicine well the medicine didn't heal
[2:13:48] only god is healer he said i'm the lord
[2:13:50] that heals all
[2:13:51] thy diseases i'm the only healer there
[2:13:53] is
[2:13:55] so hospitals can heal amen
[2:13:58] you know but but what do you know any
[2:14:01] healing that comes
[2:14:02] comes from god now satan is a prince
[2:14:06] of atmospheres and he gains power over
[2:14:10] you
[2:14:11] to getting you to lose faith and to
[2:14:14] disbelieve
[2:14:16] now as the prince of atmosphere his
[2:14:18] atmospheres are
[2:14:20] full of evil spirits to accuse us and
[2:14:24] tempt us and do as much evil and harm in
[2:14:27] the world as he can
[2:14:28] that's his job he's doing every bit of
[2:14:32] harm that he can
[2:14:35] he you know and there again he he he
[2:14:38] gets in this nation
[2:14:39] stirs up against strife again gets in
[2:14:41] this race drives up
[2:14:42] and cause strife against this race
[2:14:44] against the other and
[2:14:46] on and on and on and on here we go
[2:14:49] he tries to he tries to close
[2:14:52] off the heaven with veils of darkness
[2:14:56] and doubt and fear and unbelief sin and
[2:14:59] sickness
[2:15:00] now you know on a normal day sun would
[2:15:03] be shining
[2:15:05] but you know here we get all these
[2:15:07] storms that comes in and a typhoon and
[2:15:09] for our
[2:15:10] hurricane and for days the the the
[2:15:13] clouds
[2:15:14] obscure the light of the sun same thing
[2:15:17] that happens there satan comes along
[2:15:19] with his clouds of doubt
[2:15:21] and confusion you know and
[2:15:24] and tries to veil the heavens from us
[2:15:27] with veils of darkness of doubt of fear
[2:15:30] of unbelief of sin and sickness
[2:15:33] he'll use sickness and troubles to
[2:15:36] attack the mightiest preachers
[2:15:38] that god has to keep them in bondage of
[2:15:41] fear
[2:15:42] tempting them to question thus
[2:15:45] doubt god
[2:15:49] are you with me now so here's his work
[2:15:51] you know we
[2:15:52] we come along how does this why did this
[2:15:54] happen to me

[2:19:53] perfect faith brother branham said
[2:19:56] he said we're trying to get the church
[2:19:58] into place we could really see
[2:20:00] apostolic times moving among us that's
[2:20:02] all what we hunger for
[2:20:04] he said it's just laying right at the
[2:20:06] door and we see it but we want to see
[2:20:08] more of it
[2:20:10] how about it evening light we've seen it
[2:20:13] but we are not just satisfied with what
[2:20:15] we've seen we will see more of it
[2:20:17] amen we want it it's such a flow it'll
[2:20:19] be a help to us
[2:20:20] and it'll flow out to others we want the
[2:20:23] whole world to know
[2:20:24] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[2:20:27] and forever
[2:20:28] his power is the same his word is the
[2:20:31] same his gifts are the same
[2:20:34] he's the same in every detail except his
[2:20:36] corporal body
[2:20:37] and and where is he at what corporal
[2:20:40] body is in now your body and mind
[2:20:44] remember jesus he said never used his
[2:20:47] power for himself
[2:20:48] he used it for others and that's what it
[2:20:50] was sent for
[2:20:51] and you think well why would a man that
[2:20:54] was so
[2:20:55] full of power like him ever would have
[2:20:58] to
[2:20:58] ever be sick you know say oh no jesus
[2:21:02] was perfect and he was a god man and he
[2:21:04] was never sick well
[2:21:06] go with me down to calvary
[2:21:12] affliction is laid on him
[2:21:15] whenever pain is laid on him
[2:21:20] i i know you know there may be some
[2:21:22] teachers that teach and say jesus
[2:21:24] jesus he was the perfect man he never
[2:21:26] got sick no jesus became sick
[2:21:30] he became a man and brother branham
[2:21:33] referred to
[2:21:34] a book that he read of the prince of the
[2:21:35] house of david he sat on a rock and
[2:21:37] grown with a headache see
[2:21:38] he bore our infirmities he said
[2:21:43] he bear means to pack him he bored he
[2:21:45] had sickness
[2:21:47] he had temptations he had troubles
[2:21:50] he had frustrations just as we have
[2:21:53] because he had to be the right kind of
[2:21:55] mediator so he had to be a partaker the
[2:21:57] husband of the fruit
[2:21:58] before he would know so he too would
[2:22:01] have to endure satan's dirty breath
[2:22:04] in hand-to-hand combat come on
[2:22:08] amen listen i'm trying to show you
[2:22:12] jesus went through things you're going
[2:22:13] to go through things too
[2:22:15] you're in a battle this is not a big
[2:22:18] nick
[2:22:21] you're not of course this is par for the
[2:22:23] course
[2:22:29] he said when trials come don't think
[2:22:31] there's some strange thing that's
[2:22:32] happened to you
[2:22:36] are things that aren't common to man
[2:22:40] when satan came to brother branham after
[2:22:42] hope and sharon rose's death
[2:22:45] he couldn't tell brother branham if
[2:22:46] there was no god
[2:22:48] he just told him god didn't love him
[2:22:54] you prayed for this and you prayed for
[2:22:56] that one and you know now where are all
[2:22:58] those miracles and here you pray for
[2:22:59] your own girl
[2:23:00] your own daughter and your own wife and
[2:23:02] they die
[2:23:05] he took a beating over it
[2:23:09] now question him how could god
[2:23:13] be merciful be a merciful god and let
[2:23:16] your wife and your little baby die
[2:23:20] you're pleading for their life
[2:23:23] don't you think satan put thoughts in
[2:23:25] his mind
[2:23:28] brother brethren said he came to me to
[2:23:30] the point
[2:23:31] i was just about to say god if that's
[2:23:33] the way you are
[2:23:34] i'm through that's how far down he
[2:23:44] reached
[2:23:46] but you know what in his own way not
[2:23:48] that he's our mediator but in his own
[2:23:50] way
[2:23:50] it made brother branham uh you know with
[2:23:53] a heart full
[2:23:54] of compassion every time from then on he
[2:23:57] looked at a cross-eyed child
[2:24:00] and god healed it every time
[2:24:03] why from what he went through
[2:24:07] so that so that god would turn
[2:24:10] that thing around and use it for his
[2:24:13] glory
[2:24:14] do you know how many times over and
[2:24:16] again i have gotten
[2:24:17] letters from about mariah and atlanta
[2:24:21] and karen and different ones that
[2:24:24] telling me
[2:24:24] you know you know because they went
[2:24:27] through this
[2:24:29] it gave me such faith in my trial
[2:24:37] now so you see satan put all of those
[2:24:41] things together
[2:24:43] come whisper there because he was trying
[2:24:47] to control his atmosphere because he
[2:24:50] controlled brother brown's atmosphere he
[2:24:52] controls him
[2:24:57] just like the weather controls your
[2:24:59] moods
[2:25:05] these storms these clouds to control
[2:25:08] your atmosphere
[2:25:11] satan's there prince of the power of
[2:25:14] atmospheres sending down his
[2:25:17] thunderbolts and lightning bolts and
[2:25:19] striking here and there
[2:25:20] and this one gets struck around in there
[2:25:23] and
[2:25:24] put in fear and doubt and confusion and
[2:25:26] unbelief
[2:25:32] even in the secular world brother you
[2:25:34] know you listen to the news
[2:25:37] and you get struck
[2:25:40] i mean it just smites your heart i mean
[2:25:44] all the killings the murders the
[2:25:46] horrible things that
[2:25:47] you know the the horrible things that
[2:25:50] are happening
[2:25:51] in the world today are you with me
[2:25:54] amen and it controls your atmospheres
[2:25:58] you you let those things affect you
[2:26:01] i just tell you brother brandon said i
[2:26:02] was driving along taking my daughter to
[2:26:04] school
[2:26:05] and he said i i turned the radio on was
[2:26:07] listening to a broadcast that
[2:26:09] was saying that creation was just the
[2:26:11] masses blowing together some phosphates
[2:26:13] and few chemicals of earth and
[2:26:14] warm sunshine created a general life and
[2:26:17] brought out life
[2:26:20] how ridiculous when sunshine will kill
[2:26:22] any germ of life lay a germ out in the
[2:26:25] sunshine and kill it immediately and and
[2:26:27] there's no such thing
[2:26:28] but satan was just trying to punch at me
[2:26:34] and after i dropped my daughter off to
[2:26:35] school he said as i was going up the
[2:26:37] street
[2:26:38] satan said to me
[2:26:44] what this same devil would appear in his
[2:26:48] room and
[2:26:49] and and look like a deformed creature
[2:26:52] and
[2:26:52] singing like a chicken going to his to
[2:26:55] the hen yard
[2:26:56] you know in a in a mocking voice and
[2:26:59] accusing him
[2:27:01] saying you're nothing but a fake and all
[2:27:04] these miracles you talk about is just a
[2:27:06] fake
[2:27:10] after seeing blind eyes open cripples
[2:27:13] walk
[2:27:15] and he's still come in his ears
[2:27:21] and he said as i was going down the
[2:27:23] street there listening to
[2:27:25] you know you know i had been listening
[2:27:28] to that and as i was going up the street
[2:27:29] after
[2:27:30] hearing this satan said to me you know
[2:27:33] this man you call
[2:27:34] jesus just like any other man in his day
[2:27:38] like a billy graham or roberts you just
[2:27:39] a man that they begin to have a few
[2:27:41] people gather around him say he's a
[2:27:43] great man
[2:27:44] and after a while he became greater and
[2:27:46] he become a god to them and now it's
[2:27:48] scattered over the world
[2:27:49] since he's dead and that's all
[2:27:54] and he said and i thought how a liar you
[2:27:58] are
[2:28:03] that's the way we ought to do it friends
[2:28:06] we hear
[2:28:06] all of this unbelief going satan
[2:28:10] how a liar you are i turned his eyes
[2:28:14] crossing graham sweet i said
[2:28:15] satan you've been you that's been
[2:28:17] talking to my conscience
[2:28:19] i'd like to ask you a few things who was
[2:28:22] that that the hebrew prophet spoke of
[2:28:24] that would come

[2:28:34] he just a letter
[2:28:35] and when he come he was numbered with
[2:28:37] the transgressors and he was wounded for
[2:28:38] our transgression

[2:28:41] arise on the third day and he did
[2:28:43] and he promised the holy ghost and i've
