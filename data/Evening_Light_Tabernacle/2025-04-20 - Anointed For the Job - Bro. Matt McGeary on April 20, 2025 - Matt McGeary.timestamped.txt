[15:47] Hallelujah. Amen. Well, did you enjoy
[15:49] church last night?
[15:52] Amen. Amen. We had a wonderful time in

[16:03] this morning and and pull on the gift of
[16:05] God in the ministry this morning. We did
[16:08] have a Bible that was turned in. I don't
[16:11] know if it has a name on it. So, if this
[16:14] is your Bible, if you're missing your
[16:16] Bible and you want it, this is what we
[16:19] call the lost and found up in here, but
[16:21] you may need it for service. So, if you
[16:23] want it, you're welcome to come up and
[16:24] grab it at some point during the song
[16:26] service. It won't bother me a bit. Come
[16:28] get your sword. You can have that. Also,
[16:31] there will be a baptismal uh after the
[16:34] service again this morning. We had
[16:35] somebody else
[16:36] that had to talk some things over with
[16:40] the Lord last night and they want to get
[16:41] baptized this
[16:44] morning. Thankful for that.
[16:49] Amen.
[16:51] Amen. Amen. So, another opportunity if
[16:54] you have not been baptized according to
[16:58] the scripture and you want to get
[16:59] baptized as well, there's another
[17:01] opportunity for that after the service
[17:02] today. See, brother Joe Adams and Amen.
[17:06] We can have that. Amen. Also, if you
[17:09] haven't picked up your t-shirt, if you
[17:10] bought a shirt when you registered, if
[17:12] you were registered by someone at your
[17:14] church or your parents registered you
[17:16] and they ordered a shirt for you, we
[17:19] want to make sure you get that. So see
[17:21] brother Joe after as well. Make sure
[17:22] that that shirt gets to you. Amen. We're
[17:26] sort of thankful that you're here.
[17:28] Thankful that you're a part and it's
[17:30] been wonderful
[17:31] to be with you and enjoy the worship.
[17:35] And Amen. God is good. And we
[17:38] have I think
[17:41] about seven or eight maybe nine specials
[17:45] still. We won't get to them. Don't be
[17:46] mad at me. Amen. And we uh and brother
[17:51] Timothy look at them together. We pray
[17:53] over what we're going to do and just
[17:55] trust that you'll give us a little grace
[17:58] if you're not called up and Amen. We're

[18:03] for the Lord. Amen. Let's just go to him
[18:05] together in prayer this morning. Father,
[18:07] we love you. We thank you again for an
[18:10] opportunity that we have here, Lord, to
[18:13] worship you, to lift our hands, Lord.
[18:18] Lord, here's a day
[18:20] that many in the world set aside to
[18:23] remember your
[18:26] resurrection. But Lord, we thank you
[18:28] that you've chosen a bride, Lord, that
[18:31] knows you as a real and living God every
[18:33] day of the
[18:36] week. Lord, in every moment, Lord, that
[18:39] we can come to you and thank you. We
[18:42] want to do that. We thank you for the
[18:45] service this morning, Lord. We thank you
[18:47] for your
[18:48] word for the musicians that have given
[18:51] themselves and the different ones in the
[18:53] booths in the back and the many campers
[18:56] and the
[18:57] counselors each part of this whole camp
[18:59] that you've given us, Lord. And we want
[19:01] to give back to you in this last
[19:03] service, Father, the absolute best that
[19:06] we have.
[19:08] We pray that you'll move on the songs
[19:09] that are sung. Move on the ministry of
[19:12] the word. Touch brother Matt McGaryi as
[19:14] he prepares to minister. Lord, give him
[19:17] wisdom. Give him strength, Lord. Lord,
[19:21] and use him, Father, we pray in a very
[19:25] supernatural way. We love you. We commit

[19:31] name.
[19:33] Amen. Amen.
[19:35] You've
[19:40] seen I know a lot of you just turned
[19:42] around, shook somebody's
[19:44] hand. This is the last
[19:48] service. Now you've shaken a lot of
[19:51] hands. Go find a hand you haven't
[19:53] shaken.
[19:55] Oh, when we
[19:57] all get to
[20:00] heaven, what a day of rejoicing that
[20:04] will
[20:05] be. And when we

[20:11] Jesus, we will sing and shout the
[20:15] victory.
[20:17] Oh, let us let it be true and
[20:23] faithful, trusting,
[20:25] serving every day. Oh, just one glimpse
[20:31] of him
[20:33] glory will the trails of life prepare.

[23:09] your seat.
[23:11] [Applause]
[23:30] Amen. Through the eyes of men, it seems
[23:34] there's so much we have
[23:36] lost. As we look down the road where all
[23:41] the water goats have
[23:44] walked, one by one, the
[23:51] [Music]
[24:04] enemies, we know there is more to come
[24:08] that we may not yet
[24:10] seek. So with the faith you've given us,

[27:44] faith so persistent determined
[27:49] She must touch

[28:02] failures, disappointments and fears.
[28:06] Accept your condition with a multitude.
[28:10] You will not see us.
[28:16] I can hear her rejoicing as she looks
[28:20] down the lane. She sees someone coming
[28:24] and they're calling his name. Son of
[28:27] David, Messiah. She heard someone call
[28:32] him the
[28:36] healer. The crippled that labor now
[28:40] leaping for joy. Those who were blind
[28:45] were beholding the Lord. Can this be the
[28:49] moment? Or would hindrances many conceal
[28:57] her? Her heartbeat so fast as he came
[29:01] into sight. Her emotions were filled
[29:05] with both joy and with pride.
[29:09] She let him pass by, but not out of
[29:13] reach. And she touched his garment. He

[40:35] name. I can say I'm one of
[40:39] them. I'm one of
[40:42] them. I'm one of
[40:44] them. I'm so glad I can say I'm one of
[40:50] them. One of
[40:52] them. One of them.

[40:59] them. Well, sing that verse again. Help

[41:25] them. Oh, I'm so glad I can say I'm one
[41:30] of
[41:33] them. Oh, I'm one of
[41:36] them. I'm so glad I could
[41:40] say,
[41:41] "Oh, I've been
[41:44] changed. I've been reborn. in all my
[41:48] life has been
[41:52] rearranged. What a difference that it
[41:55] makes when the Lord has his way all my
[41:59] life. Praise God. Oh, sing it again.

[42:22] Well, go ahead and sing it like you mean
[42:27] it. Oh, all my life has been

[42:37] the Lord has his way all my life. Praise
[42:42] God. Oh, when at last in his presence,
[42:45] when at last in his presence I stand
[42:49] above, he will w every tear from my
[42:54] eyes. And I'll thank him for giving a
[42:58] wretch like me, a new home beyond the
[43:04] sky. I've been changed.
[43:08] Oh, I've been
[43:10] rehorned. All my life has been
[43:15] rearranged. What a difference it makes.
[43:28] Hallelujah.
[43:30] All right. You say that microphone is
[43:32] more powerful. There's more power in
[43:34] this. There's more power in this
[43:36] microphone cuz there's power in the
[43:38] blood. Well, there is power. Power.
[43:42] There's a wonder working power in the
[43:46] blood of the
[43:49] lamb. There is power. Power in the
[43:53] wonder. Power in the precious blood of
[43:58] the
[43:59] lamb. There is power. Oh, power. Oh
[44:03] wonder working power in the blood in the
[44:07] blood of the lamb of the lamb there is
[44:13] power working

[44:17] power of the lamb. Hallelujah. Why don't
[44:21] you just praise the
[44:22] [Applause]
[44:23] Lord? I said why don't you just praise
[44:26] the Lord.
[44:28] Go ahead take a little moment. Just give
[44:31] him praise. Lord, thank you for
[44:32] deliverance. Thank you for the victory.
[44:35] Thanks for healing me. Thanks for
[44:36] touching me last night.
[44:39] Lord, thanks for calling me. Thanks for
[44:42] bringing me here. Well, we got a whole
[44:45] lot to praise him for
[44:48] here on this resurrection morning.
[44:53] Because he lives,
[44:56] I live also. Amen. It's all because of
[44:59] him. That's why we're gathered here.
[45:01] You know, the world makes their big
[45:03] gatherings and they
[45:05] celebrate many events and they have big
[45:08] parties for New Years and they make big
[45:10] celebrations out of certain events and
[45:12] championships. But we're here to
[45:14] celebrate the champion of champions, the
[45:17] mighty conqueror. He is not dead, but he
[45:19] is alive cuz he rose on that third day
[45:22] to
[45:22] proclaim, "I am the champion of
[45:25] champions." And the champion of
[45:27] champions is here this morning. and
[45:30] we're going to worship them and give him
[45:31] praise. Amen. All right, we'll just go
[45:34] before the Lord as we have the
[45:35] musicians. Heavenly Father, we just
[45:38] thank you so much, Lord,
[45:40] for what you've done for us this
[45:43] weekend, Lord.
[45:46] You've Lord, you're so good to
[45:50] us, Lord. When your word says
[45:54] that you'll do exceedingly and
[45:56] abundantly above what all we can ask or
[45:58] think. It's true,
[46:00] Lord. And you've never failed us one
[46:03] time.
[46:06] Sometimes in our mind we get a little
[46:08] confused and
[46:09] we might not
[46:11] understand what's going on. But Lord,
[46:15] there's a revelation that knows that you
[46:17] hold it all in your hand. And you're
[46:20] able to take what's wrong and to make it
[46:22] right.
[46:23] Lord, in our trials and our sufferings,
[46:26] lost loved ones
[46:28] and family
[46:31] situations, Lord, to know that you're
[46:34] working it all out for our good. What a
[46:37] peace that gives us and a
[46:39] confidence. Certainly, it doesn't take
[46:41] away the hurt and the pain that we
[46:43] endure. Lord, we know those things are
[46:45] necessary because you told us that if
[46:48] we're going to reign with you, we have
[46:49] to suffer.
[46:52] And Lord, you told us, you've taught us,
[46:54] Lord, that character is a victory. And
[46:57] we have to suffer. Lord, we have to go
[46:58] through trials.
[47:00] And Lord, we know that you know what's
[47:03] best for us. And so, we just want to
[47:05] tell you thank you, Lord, when we
[47:08] thought things should be a different
[47:09] way. Maybe we thought our prayer should
[47:13] have been answered at this time or this
[47:16] moment and we had to endure or maybe
[47:18] still enduring.
[47:20] Lord, may that revelation just anchor
[47:23] down in our soul greater than it's ever
[47:25] anchored
[47:27] before that you know what you're doing.
[47:30] I don't always know, but as long as you
[47:33] know, Lord, that I'm just going to trust
[47:35] you, Father. And if I trust you, I know
[47:38] that you'll use me, Lord,
[47:41] and you'll get all the glory and all the
[47:43] honor and all the
[47:45] praise. Amen. We love you, Lord.
[47:49] Amen. We
[47:51] just thank the musicians. Maybe uh you
[47:54] can just have your seats for a moment.
[47:56] Uh you can bring the monitors down just
[47:59] a little bit.
[48:01] Well, how many are excited to be here?
[48:05] How many of you are tired?
[48:08] We're right back where we started.
[48:12] The alpha has become omega.
[48:16] But God's done a lot of things between
[48:17] Thursday and today. Amen.
[48:21] We might we might be excited to be here.
[48:23] We might be tired, but we've been
[48:25] changed.
[48:27] Amen. Yes, sir. We've been changed.
[48:30] Well, we we won't try to hold you too
[48:31] long, but we might stand you up and sit
[48:33] you down and keep you awake because I've
[48:35] sat where you're sat, but y'all y'all
[48:37] ought to be the most thankful campers
[48:39] that Louisiana camp has ever had because
[48:42] I believe this is the first time service
[48:43] has ever been at 9:30. Come on. Hey, I
[48:46] believe that deserves a hand
[48:51] clap. I mean, I I have sat where you
[48:54] have sat and there was four preachers on
[48:57] the platform. My eyes were so
[49:00] crossed. I was trying I was trying to
[49:03] stay awake and I I'd see four preachers
[49:05] trying to make four become one. One
[49:08] would become four, not three.
[49:12] But you put a lot of effort and expend a
[49:14] lot of energy. And I just want to thank
[49:16] brother Tim and Evening Like Tabernacle
[49:19] for for just putting on an amazing camp
[49:28] and and all those behind the scenes, all
[49:31] the counselors and and those that have
[49:33] drove and those pastors that have
[49:35] supported and and parents that have sent
[49:37] their uh their youth here. Uh we
[49:40] appreciate it. And also I want to say
[49:42] thank you to our campers. Amen. Thank
[49:45] you for coming because uh without you
[49:48] there's no youth camp
[49:51] and and it's I I'm just so thankful that
[49:53] there's a a group of young people rising
[49:55] up that love God
[49:58] and want to serve God and believe this
[50:00] message and and believe it all and live
[50:02] it all. And you're you're the chosen
[50:04] generation. We're running the final lap
[50:06] and you are the ones that are called.
[50:08] And so we just want to put our shoulder
[50:10] to the wheel and uh just do our part to
[50:13] help. It's just been a a a great honor
[50:16] to serve with Brother Ron and Brother
[50:18] Matt and uh just each of you. So we just
[50:21] give God all the glory. So why don't we
[50:23] go ahead and stand? We just read our
[50:26] text out of Psalms 23.
[50:39] Why haven't the the the the meetings
[50:41] been so powerful?
[50:44] Just the word of God. You know, I was uh
[50:47] just talking to um Brother Matt back
[50:50] there. And by God's grace, my title will
[50:52] be anointed for the the job. And I was
[50:56] thinking, you know, we we've we've
[50:57] turned the corner. We're standing up to
[51:00] our bully and we're running the final
[51:02] lap because we're the man in the arena
[51:04] and we're anointed for the job.
[51:08] Praise God. Amen. We're reading out of
[51:11] Psalms 23. This might be a little bit
[51:13] different approach to um an Easter
[51:16] service, but we just want God to have
[51:18] his his way. Are y'all ready to run?
[51:21] Amen. Psalms 23 and verse4. Very
[51:24] familiar. I would I would say work on
[51:27] remembering this passage. It's a very
[51:29] wonderful passage. We'll just start with
[51:30] with uh verse four in Psalm 23. It says,
[51:34] well, we might as well read the whole
[51:35] thing. It ain't that long, is it? The
[51:36] Lord is my strength. I shall not want.
[51:39] He maketh me to lie down in green
[51:41] pastures. He leadth me beside still
[51:43] waters. He restoth my soul. He leadth me
[51:47] in the paths of righteousness for his
[51:49] name's sake. Yay, though I walk through
[51:51] the valley of the shadow of death, I
[51:53] will fear no evil, for thou art with me.
[51:56] Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
[51:58] Amen. Thou preparest a table before me
[52:01] in the presence of mine enemies. Thou
[52:02] anointest my head with oil. My cup runth
[52:05] over. Surely goodness and mercy shall
[52:08] follow me all the days of my life, and I
[52:10] will dwell in the house of the Lord
[52:13] forever. Lord, we just ask a blessing
[52:15] upon the reading of your word. In Jesus
[52:17] Christ's name we pray. Amen. You may be
[52:19] seated.
[52:22] I just want to as we said uh title this
[52:26] anointed for the job and and maybe just
[52:30] for a subject victory in the valley
[52:34] and brother Brandham would say this we
[52:36] just like said maybe just a little bit
[52:38] different of approach here but brother
[52:40] Brandham says in an absolute he says
[52:41] people talk about devils and don't even
[52:43] know what they are sometimes that's
[52:45] right but you run headlong into them
[52:48] every day maybe but you will. And after
[52:51] a while, he was accusing me. So, Brother
[52:53] Brandham's talking about, I believe,
[52:54] this uh um uh the spirit, he says it was
[52:57] like an alleyoop. If you've ever looked
[52:58] up an alleyoop out, it's some, you know,
[53:00] prehistoric man with a club on him. And
[53:03] he he he was he was accusing the
[53:05] prophet. And he says, "And after a
[53:07] while, he he was accusing me." And he
[53:08] said, "Uh, you have no power with God.
[53:11] You're just a bluff. You have no power."
[53:14] You know, and and if if if if Satan's
[53:16] going to attack the prophet,
[53:20] who was on record as God showing up time
[53:22] and time and time again, over and over
[53:25] and over. And he was going to come and
[53:27] tell the prophet, "Look, you're just a
[53:28] bluff and you have no power. Don't think
[53:30] you're exempt from that." He's going to
[53:33] come up. He's going to try to accuse
[53:34] you. He's going to try to tell you,
[53:35] "Look, you're just a bluff. You ain't
[53:37] got no power. What happened at camp
[53:40] really didn't happen. You know, that was
[53:41] just a feeling. That was just a
[53:43] sensation. And you're just a bluff. when
[53:45] you get back home, you know, you're
[53:46] you're just going to fall to the same
[53:48] old temptations and and nothing's going
[53:50] to be any different. You're just a
[53:51] bluff. Come on. And then when you get
[53:54] home and you do make a mistake, he says,
[53:55] "Aha, see, I told you.
[54:00] But he said, I said, Satan, you're an
[54:02] offense to me.
[54:04] Get out of my
[54:06] way. Satan, you're an offense to me. Get
[54:09] out of my way in the name of Jesus
[54:11] Christ." And he left.
[54:13] Now, I just want you to to notice we're
[54:15] we're learning how to fight.
[54:17] All right? We got to know how to fight.
[54:21] We got to know how to swim in deep
[54:22] waters. And he left. And I laid there a
[54:25] little bit in the bed and started to
[54:26] raise up. And I felt a real sweet
[54:28] feeling come over me. And I thought,
[54:30] wonder if the Holy Spirit now is close.
[54:33] And over in the corner, so help me.
[54:35] Here's my Bible over my heart. The
[54:37] sweetest voice I ever heard in my life
[54:39] said, "Don't fear
[54:41] to go anywhere and don't fear to do
[54:43] anything for the never failing presence
[54:46] of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you
[54:49] go." And that settled it with me. Let
[54:52] them rage. I got an absolute. I said,
[54:55] "Let them rage. I got an absolute. My
[54:58] anchor holds yonder because it's the
[55:00] word of the living God." Look, when you
[55:02] go home, hell's going to rage.
[55:05] things are going to rage against you and
[55:06] you're going to find out you're going to
[55:08] go into a valley. You might be on the
[55:09] mountaintop right now and and you're
[55:11] surrounded with a cloud of witnesses and
[55:13] all the young people. Oh, and we feel
[55:15] the pillar of fire and we we're just so
[55:17] thankful to be here and we have we have
[55:19] strength and numbers and and expectation
[55:22] is here and and the word is being
[55:23] preached in power and demonstration and
[55:26] you've been set free and you got a clean
[55:28] spirit and you're feeling good and
[55:29] there's no condemnation. My, you just
[55:31] feel like you could speak a world into
[55:33] existence and go live on it. Well, one
[55:35] of these days, glory to God. Uh, but you
[55:37] feel so good, but you got to go back
[55:38] home.
[55:41] Come on. You're going to go into
[55:43] valleys. You're going to go into trials.
[55:47] You got to know how to fight. Yes.
[55:50] Because camp's almost over.
[55:53] This is the last service. And you know,
[55:56] I I've I've been there. you know, we got
[55:59] to go back home to our jobs and our
[56:01] daily lives and our school and and and I
[56:04] tell you, as you start to load up the
[56:07] car and the van and and it's just so
[56:09] hard to say goodbye.
[56:11] Yeah. And you just linger and linger and
[56:13] you know, I find out as you get a little
[56:15] bit older, you start to learn I got to
[56:16] do it anyway. So, you you do it a little
[56:18] quicker
[56:23] because it hurts to say goodbye.
[56:27] And then you're in this heavenly
[56:28] atmosphere with all of your friends and
[56:31] and now you're saying your last goodbyes
[56:33] and and you feel like you're you're
[56:34] you're driving away from an oasis.
[56:38] Oh, from the spirit of God and how
[56:40] wonderful everything was. And and I I
[56:43] remember just sitting there. I'm like,
[56:44] man, why, brother Tim? Can we just buy
[56:46] the
[56:47] place? Can Can we farm it? And can we
[56:50] all just live here?
[56:54] but that that that we're not in the
[56:55] millennium.
[56:57] It ain't time for that. It's time to
[57:00] fight.
[57:02] It's time to possess the land.
[57:04] It's time to win souls.
[57:07] It's time to go back and tell your mommy
[57:08] and your daddy that that Jesus Christ is
[57:10] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[57:12] It's time to go back to your church and
[57:14] and witness and testify. It's time to go
[57:17] back to your school. Amen. And say, "He
[57:19] is not dead. He's alive. Don't tell my
[57:22] disciples. He is not dead, but he has
[57:25] risen.
[57:27] Hallelujah. As you drive out there and
[57:31] maybe you go straight, right, left,
[57:32] whatever way you go, just stay right.
[57:38] And all of a sudden, you you start to
[57:40] feel overwhelmed.
[57:43] And right when you drive off the
[57:45] campground, there might be a feeling
[57:47] start to come over you of a let down.
[57:51] And that bully that brother Matt talked
[57:53] about is going to come looking for you.
[57:56] Yeah.
[57:58] That depression and that anxiety that
[58:00] you got delivered from
[58:05] Look, we we we we have been we have been
[58:07] called
[58:09] to cast out evil spirits.
[58:12] But you have been called to be anointed.
[58:14] Amen. So when that spirit comes back,
[58:17] you can stand there and say, "Yeah, I
[58:18] went through the prayer line and I was
[58:20] delivered and that evil spirit was cast
[58:22] out, but greater is he that is in me
[58:25] than he that is in the world cuz that
[58:28] pillar of fire that was swirling around
[58:30] there at dry creek Louisiana through the
[58:32] I didn't leave it at the altar. I took
[58:34] it with me and I got the mighty
[58:37] conqueror shut up in my bones.
[58:40] You bully. You picked on me long enough.
[58:45] You're going to have to face that thing
[58:46] on your own.
[58:48] Without your friends all around you,
[58:52] maybe you've been delivered from a lush
[58:53] devil and pornography. You're going to
[58:56] go back and you're going to have a
[58:58] routines and things you've gone through
[58:59] and you're going to have to face that
[59:00] thing.
[59:03] That's right.
[59:05] We're teaching you how to fight.
[59:09] We got to go back to our daily lives
[59:12] and all of a sudden all your feelings
[59:14] and everything will start to come upon
[59:18] you
[59:19] and you know and now that you've given
[59:21] your life to the
[59:23] Lord. You've laid certain things down.
[59:26] Now you got to go change the way you do
[59:28] things. That's right. Some of you have
[59:30] to sew up some slits and get a get
[59:34] exercise clothes. Mom, my dress don't
[59:36] fit. My shirt don't fit. I realize it's
[59:39] too tight.
[59:41] And some of you ain't got the revelation
[59:42] yet. So, we'll keep praying. Ain't
[59:45] condemning you, but there's this this is
[59:46] a message of holiness.
[59:49] Come on, man. I don't want to see it
[59:51] when I come to camp. I don't want to see
[59:52] it when I go to church, but I got to
[59:56] cuz we still got people who need the
[59:57] Holy Ghost. Look, the Holy Ghost knows
[1:00:00] how to dress you. The message of the
[1:00:01] hour knows how to dress you. And it
[1:00:03] ain't a dead letter. When you get the
[1:00:04] God of this message, the God of William
[1:00:06] Brandon, and you get it in your life,
[1:00:08] it'll tell you how to dress. It'll tell
[1:00:10] you how to act. It'll clean up your
[1:00:11] life. It'll keep you off the website,
[1:00:14] it'll keep you off them apps. It'll
[1:00:16] unfollow. It will unsubscribe.
[1:00:20] Because I got to unfollow because I'm
[1:00:22] following Jesus Christ.
[1:00:25] Look, y'all have it much harder than I
[1:00:27] had it when I got home. you know, uh uh
[1:00:30] I I I I when I got when I got born again
[1:00:34] and filled with the Holy Ghost, you
[1:00:35] know, I uh things were more physical and
[1:00:38] you could break it and throw it away or
[1:00:39] whatnot, but but now everything's
[1:00:41] digital. You you you delete it and throw
[1:00:43] it throw it away and it's just like your
[1:00:45] thumb has a mind of its own. Like, how'd
[1:00:46] that get back on my phone?
[1:00:49] I just deleted that and threw it away
[1:00:51] and that app's back.
[1:00:54] You're going on to stream a sermon and I
[1:00:57] turn your recommendations off.
[1:01:01] Turn it off. Who's making the
[1:01:04] recommendation?
[1:01:07] I don't think God up there in heaven
[1:01:08] say, "Hey, I think you got to recommend
[1:01:09] this on YouTube."
[1:01:11] Oh, you you go on because I I remember I
[1:01:13] just give a personal testimony. Uh when
[1:01:16] CO hit and and you know, our church was
[1:01:18] looking for a way to maybe make it
[1:01:20] available to to our congregation. They
[1:01:22] they we put it on YouTube. And so I get
[1:01:24] on YouTube to watch one of our sermons
[1:01:26] and guess I ended up watching not one of
[1:01:27] our sermons.
[1:01:29] Hey, what am I doing?
[1:01:32] Because it's a spiritual warfare and we
[1:01:34] can't be ignorant of Satan's devices.
[1:01:40] Look, look, friends, if there's anything
[1:01:41] you got to do, you got to you got to you
[1:01:43] got to do battle with this. This is
[1:01:45] ruining people's lives.
[1:01:48] This is bringing condemnation and
[1:01:51] bringing suicidal spirits and getting
[1:01:53] people condemned where they have no
[1:01:55] confidence with God. And before you even
[1:01:57] make it back home, you'll find something
[1:01:59] on there where you feel like you lost
[1:02:01] your victory.
[1:02:03] Look, I'm preaching to you this morning.
[1:02:05] I'm telling you how to fight. That cell
[1:02:08] phone is not your friend. It's your
[1:02:10] enemy.
[1:02:15] But we got to be like David. Come on,
[1:02:18] Satan. You brought that sword out here
[1:02:20] to do battle against me. But we got to
[1:02:23] take the weapons. We got to use them for
[1:02:25] good. We got to do battle. I ain't
[1:02:28] trying to tell you ain't You don't have
[1:02:29] to have a cell phone.
[1:02:31] But if you can't handle it, you need to
[1:02:34] get somebody that can. You need to get
[1:02:36] the Holy Ghost because we make mistakes.
[1:02:38] We make failures.
[1:02:40] You know, when you go from here, I just
[1:02:42] want to tell you, you got to feed the
[1:02:43] fire.
[1:02:50] I know what I'm talking about. I I sat
[1:02:51] here and may maybe about oh 30 35 years
[1:02:56] ago it was I sat maybe right over this
[1:02:58] way and and the sanctuary is facing this
[1:03:01] way and there's a wall going down the
[1:03:02] middle and there there was a gym on this
[1:03:04] side and a and we made this the
[1:03:05] sanctuary over here and you know I was a
[1:03:07] I was a you know I was I wasn't a good
[1:03:10] kid. I was the typical preacher son. And
[1:03:12] and you know, I I I would take two
[1:03:14] bathroom breaks to get out of the
[1:03:15] service, you know, you time them just
[1:03:17] right. And you know, come on. You know,
[1:03:20] you watch it and when service starts
[1:03:22] getting to that moment, you'll see
[1:03:23] certain ones want to get up. That's my
[1:03:24] cue. I'm out of here. Come on. Come on.
[1:03:27] You know, but I I woke up in the
[1:03:29] presence of the Lord just supernatural.
[1:03:30] I didn't have time to harden my heart. I
[1:03:32] don't know. I just I just woke up in the
[1:03:34] presence of the Lord and I was in his
[1:03:35] presence and I started worship of the
[1:03:37] Lord and there was a call and and I
[1:03:39] found my way through through a prayer
[1:03:41] line or something. I felt like I was
[1:03:43] floating. It was just it was just
[1:03:44] amazing and and there was a call for
[1:03:47] baptism and I got baptized and it was
[1:03:48] just so uh such a wonderful experience
[1:03:50] and and my I went back home and and was
[1:03:53] so excited that I had met Jesus
[1:03:57] but you know I didn't feed that fire
[1:04:01] and if I could say anything you you know
[1:04:03] to to any of you if you see a young one
[1:04:06] in your church that that has has made an
[1:04:08] effort for God I I do everything to
[1:04:10] nurture that fire. I didn't have a youth
[1:04:13] group when I got back home. I was on my
[1:04:15] own. But, you know, uh I say we're in a
[1:04:18] in a great place. If you have uh mothers
[1:04:20] and fathers that believe this message
[1:04:22] and a youth group and a church, nurture
[1:04:24] that. Uh look, I say, you know, God
[1:04:26] really did something for so and so. Is
[1:04:28] there a way we can nurture that and and
[1:04:30] just encourage them? Because you know
[1:04:31] what's going to happen? Yes, sir.
[1:04:34] If you don't find him, the devil's going
[1:04:36] to
[1:04:39] he's going to be looking for him saying
[1:04:40] cuz you got a target on your back now.
[1:04:43] Oh, you believe this message. You've
[1:04:44] been born again. You got baptized. Okay.
[1:04:47] Now, hell's training its targets on you.
[1:04:50] But as long as you're just the
[1:04:51] makeeliever and you're just being
[1:04:53] religious and and you're just happy to
[1:04:54] have a good time, he'll let you do all
[1:04:56] that. But as soon as you start claiming
[1:04:58] that you've been born again and you've
[1:04:59] had a real experience, you can say, "All
[1:05:01] right, this is one we got to look out
[1:05:02] for."
[1:05:04] And you know what happened to me is I
[1:05:07] didn't feed that fire. And before you
[1:05:08] know it, I just hanging out with the
[1:05:10] kids in the neighborhood. You know, it
[1:05:13] was innocent playing ball and certain
[1:05:15] things like that, but as you grow up,
[1:05:17] you start doing things that ain't so
[1:05:18] innocent. And I got pulled out into the
[1:05:20] world. So I I just want to encourage
[1:05:21] you. You got to feed the fire.
[1:05:26] Whe whether you're in a justified state,
[1:05:28] sanctified state, look there there there
[1:05:30] just just keep going on with God. Just
[1:05:33] thank God for what he done and keep
[1:05:34] believing for him to do more for you.
[1:05:37] But when you go
[1:05:40] home, you're going to have to fight.
[1:05:44] And Jesus taught us how to fight.
[1:05:47] When Satan tempted him, he said, "It is
[1:05:49] written." Amen. It is written. Brother
[1:05:52] Brandham said he stayed with the
[1:05:55] original artillery.
[1:05:57] Amen. So, how you going to overcome when
[1:05:58] you go home? Right. How you going to
[1:06:01] overcome when you go home? Come on. The
[1:06:03] word.
[1:06:05] The word. You're going to overcome with
[1:06:07] the word. That Jesus taught us how to
[1:06:09] fight. You use the word.
[1:06:13] So, you you got to feed the fire. And I
[1:06:15] was just thinking on that and thinking
[1:06:17] about my own life and it reminded me of
[1:06:19] how um the story about that Indian chief
[1:06:22] who who who said he he received the Holy
[1:06:24] Ghost. He asked him how he was doing. He
[1:06:25] said, "Well, good and bad." He said,
[1:06:27] "Well, what do you mean?" He said,
[1:06:28] "Well, I find out there's two dogs in
[1:06:30] me." He said, "Well, which one wins?" He
[1:06:32] says, "Well, which oneever chief feeds
[1:06:34] the most?"
[1:06:36] Doesn't mean you don't have the Holy
[1:06:38] Ghost. It means you got a a nature that
[1:06:40] you got to die daily to.
[1:06:43] Look, look, look, you can be born again
[1:06:44] and filled with the Holy Ghost and that
[1:06:46] sin nature completely taken out of you,
[1:06:48] but that nature will try to follow after
[1:06:50] you and influence you and try to come
[1:06:51] back into the seat of position again.
[1:06:53] That's why Paul said you got to die
[1:06:55] daily. Amen.
[1:06:57] That's why they asked brother Brandman
[1:06:58] questions and answers in ' 64 about I
[1:07:00] believe about Romans 7 saying Paul say
[1:07:03] the things that I want to do I don't do
[1:07:04] and the things I want to do I don't do
[1:07:06] and and I would and I don't and I I
[1:07:08] don't what's going on. And this person
[1:07:11] asked Brother Benham I don't understand
[1:07:13] that. He said well let me polish it up
[1:07:15] for you a little bit for you. There's
[1:07:16] basically two men.
[1:07:19] He said there there's a there's a
[1:07:20] there's a flesh nature that's going to
[1:07:22] be sticky. It's going to be attracted to
[1:07:24] the things of the world because it has
[1:07:25] those five senses. But there's another
[1:07:27] man that there's only one sense. It's
[1:07:29] the sense of faith. And if those other
[1:07:32] senses don't don't agree with that six
[1:07:34] sense of faith, you leave that alone.
[1:07:37] True. But if they line up, then okay,
[1:07:39] that's all right.
[1:07:42] Look, like I said, this might be a
[1:07:44] little bit of a different approach, but
[1:07:45] but but we we we're happy for what God
[1:07:48] did for us here. But but we got to go
[1:07:49] back and we got to fight.
[1:07:52] Yes, sir.
[1:07:54] Cuz right now, I just want to take a
[1:07:57] moment cuz right now your spirit's clean
[1:08:00] and you don't have any
[1:08:02] condemnation and you've been washed by
[1:08:04] the water of the word and but Monday's
[1:08:06] coming
[1:08:08] and all of those things are going to
[1:08:10] come looking for you. And brother
[1:08:11] Brandham said it like this in perfect
[1:08:12] faith. He said, "If our hearts condemn
[1:08:14] us not, then we have confidence with
[1:08:15] God. But as long as you're doing things
[1:08:17] that are wrong, you can't have
[1:08:18] confidence towards God." So you see,
[1:08:20] you'll automatically know that you're
[1:08:21] wrong. You automatically put yourself
[1:08:23] back there as a sinner by knowing that
[1:08:25] you're wrong.
[1:08:27] That that but look, you don't have to
[1:08:30] come back to camp and find this altar.
[1:08:32] You got an altar in your heart.
[1:08:36] When you go from this camp and you make
[1:08:38] a mistake, all you have to do is say,
[1:08:39] "Lord, be quick to repent." And be
[1:08:42] zealous to repent.
[1:08:46] I mean, repent right away. Don't wait
[1:08:47] another moment. You could just in your
[1:08:48] heart say, "Lord, I didn't mean to look.
[1:08:50] Lord, forgive me. I I didn't mean to
[1:08:52] entertain that. I didn't mean to gossip
[1:08:53] about my brother. I didn't mean to do
[1:08:54] that."
[1:08:57] And then, but as but as long as you
[1:08:59] allow those things to continue on, you
[1:09:01] have no confidence with God, he says,
[1:09:02] you automatically put yourself back
[1:09:04] there, a sinner by knowing that you're
[1:09:05] wrong. But when your heart don't condemn
[1:09:07] you and you know you are a believer and
[1:09:09] there's nothing between you and God. You
[1:09:10] can ask what you will and know that
[1:09:12] it'll be given you because it's the word
[1:09:14] that's given to you. Just like it was
[1:09:16] those disciples. Amen. He said, "Now the
[1:09:18] only thing you have to do then is have
[1:09:20] faith in what you are. Have faith in
[1:09:22] what the word says you are."
[1:09:27] Look, when you go back home, you got to
[1:09:29] have faith in the word. And you got to
[1:09:31] have faith in who you are. You got to
[1:09:33] have faith in what the word says you
[1:09:35] are. You are an overcomer. Look, the
[1:09:38] Bible says there's therefore now no
[1:09:40] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:09:42] Jesus. Blessed is the man whom the Lord
[1:09:45] does not impute sin. That's you. You got
[1:09:47] to have confidence. And if you make a
[1:09:49] mistake, if you make a if you trip up
[1:09:51] and fall, you say, "Lord, forgive me. I
[1:09:53] didn't mean that. May your Holy Spirit
[1:09:54] just come, Father, feel me. Fill me once
[1:09:56] again. I I want to serve you with all of
[1:09:58] my heart." Because as soon as you fall
[1:10:00] and you don't make it right, that
[1:10:02] condemnation comes in and Satan will
[1:10:04] start to heap up condemnation and he'll
[1:10:06] try to push you right back in the very
[1:10:08] things you just came out of. Look, I
[1:10:10] know what I'm talking about, church. I
[1:10:12] know how the devil works. The greatest
[1:10:14] battle ever fought in your mind is in
[1:10:16] your mind. It doesn't change what God
[1:10:18] did for you. It doesn't change you got
[1:10:19] the Holy Ghost. It doesn't change you
[1:10:21] got delivered. What it means what what
[1:10:23] changed is you're in a fight now. Before
[1:10:25] you weren't fighting. You were just
[1:10:27] giving in. But now you come to Dry
[1:10:29] Creek, Louisiana in 2025 and you gave
[1:10:32] your heart to God and now you're going
[1:10:34] to fight. Now you're the man in the
[1:10:36] arena.
[1:10:39] Now you got a job to
[1:10:41] do. Right?
[1:10:44] Those complexes and things are going to
[1:10:45] be looking for you.
[1:10:48] But I want to tell you, you're anointed
[1:10:50] for the job.
[1:10:53] You're anointed for the job.
[1:10:56] And I want to tell you, there's victory
[1:10:58] in the valley.
[1:11:02] Some of us are going to go and you're
[1:11:04] going to go into trials and hardship and
[1:11:06] you're going to face some things and
[1:11:07] you're going to be like, "Man, I felt
[1:11:08] like I was just on the mountaintop." But
[1:11:10] God's wanting you to take your
[1:11:12] experience here.
[1:11:15] Yes, sir. He He's wanting to take that
[1:11:17] deliverance and and that freedom and
[1:11:19] that zeal and that experience and he
[1:11:22] wants to equip you.
[1:11:24] God equips the called. He don't call the
[1:11:26] equipped.
[1:11:28] That that was the difference between
[1:11:29] David and Goliath. Goliath was equipped,
[1:11:31] but he wasn't called.
[1:11:34] David wasn't equipped, but he was
[1:11:36] called, so God equipped him.
[1:11:39] And so now you're going back and you're
[1:11:41] anointed for the job and you're going to
[1:11:43] go into hard places. You're going to go
[1:11:45] into valleys.
[1:11:47] But but but what's on my heart is I'm
[1:11:48] encouraging you. You're anointed for the
[1:11:50] job.
[1:11:52] The prophet of God said in Jesus Christ
[1:11:54] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:11:55] He said as Jesus said, "It is written."
[1:11:58] Every time Satan come to him, he said,
[1:11:59] "It is written, my father has said. My
[1:12:01] father has said,"And he defeated Satan
[1:12:03] on the word." And every Christian here
[1:12:06] can defeat Satan any place, anytime,
[1:12:09] anywhere. On the word of the living God,
[1:12:11] say, "Thus sayaith the Lord, it is
[1:12:12] written." When you pray tonight, say,
[1:12:14] "Lord, I accept my healing. I believe
[1:12:16] it." No matter what you feel like.
[1:12:20] No matter what you feel like, I believe
[1:12:22] it. Jesus never did say, "Did you feel
[1:12:25] it?" He said, "Did you believe it?"
[1:12:29] Not your feeling. He's not the high
[1:12:31] priest of your feeling.
[1:12:33] Amen. He's the high priest of your
[1:12:36] confession. You accept it. You believe
[1:12:39] it and you confess it. Look, our prophet
[1:12:41] taught us how to fight. You accept it.
[1:12:44] You believe it and you confess it.
[1:12:49] Yes, sir.
[1:12:51] Some of us have accepted it. Some of us
[1:12:55] have believed it. But there's another
[1:12:58] stage.
[1:13:00] You accepted it years ago. You believed
[1:13:03] it years ago, but there's another step
[1:13:06] in the process. You got to confess it. I
[1:13:09] say what we need in the building. We
[1:13:11] need some John Ryan's here. But you
[1:13:13] know, John Ryan needed to be taught. He
[1:13:16] went through the prayer line. He come
[1:13:19] through the prayer line. Brother Bannon
[1:13:21] prayed for him said, "According to your
[1:13:23] faith, you're healed." He went through
[1:13:24] and said, "I'm healed." He was blind. He
[1:13:27] couldn't see.
[1:13:29] So he came back through the prayer line.
[1:13:32] Come on. He come up to the prophet and
[1:13:33] said, "I thought you said I was healed."
[1:13:35] Want the prophecy back to him? I thought
[1:13:38] you said you believed.
[1:13:42] But then he told him what he had to do.
[1:13:47] He said, "You got to go tell about it.
[1:13:50] [Applause]
[1:13:52] You got to go testify about it. You got
[1:13:54] to go back to school. You got to go back
[1:13:56] to work. You got to go back to your
[1:13:58] church. You got to go back to your
[1:13:59] family. You got to go back to your
[1:14:01] friends. You got to go back to those
[1:14:02] places and you got to confess it. Hey,
[1:14:05] while I was at Dry Creek, Louisiana
[1:14:07] camp, I got born again. And I got filled
[1:14:09] with the Holy Ghost. Those spirits of
[1:14:11] depression, they broke away from me. I
[1:14:14] got delivered from loss. I got delivered
[1:14:15] from Porty. I've never been so free in
[1:14:18] all of my life. Testify about it. Hey,
[1:14:21] I'm going to have a baby. I'm going to
[1:14:24] be healed. Hey, you might as well get
[1:14:26] ready for it. You believe it. You
[1:14:29] accepted it. Now, just go ahead and
[1:14:31] confess it. Speak the word. I'm healed.
[1:14:35] I'm delivered. I'm filled with the Holy
[1:14:38] Ghost. I'm going in a rapture. I'm the
[1:14:41] man in the
[1:14:43] arena. I'm anointed for the
[1:14:46] job. I'm going to beat up my
[1:14:49] bully. Where you at? Depression, I'm to
[1:14:52] take your head off.
[1:14:55] Where you at, anxiety? I ain't scared no
[1:14:58] more.
[1:14:59] I am delivered.
[1:15:03] Oh, the son is made free. I set us free
[1:15:06] indeed. You're free this morning.
[1:15:11] Hallelujah.
[1:15:13] You got to confess it.
[1:15:16] You got to testify.
[1:15:19] When the devil comes lying to
[1:15:21] you, he will.
[1:15:27] You run into devils every day.
[1:15:30] Come on.
[1:15:32] What are you going to say, Satan? You're
[1:15:34] an offense to me.
[1:15:37] Get
[1:15:39] out
[1:15:40] of my way.
[1:15:44] I'm sorry. That ain't just a fancy story
[1:15:46] to me. That was a vindicated prophet
[1:15:48] teaching me how to fight.
[1:15:51] Cuz you're going to drive off these
[1:15:52] campgrounds.
[1:15:54] You might not see it manifested that
[1:15:56] way, but you're going to have a feeling
[1:15:57] of depression. You're going to have a
[1:15:58] feeling of let down. And all of a
[1:16:00] sudden, you're going to start realizing,
[1:16:02] "Oh
[1:16:04] no, I got to tell Joey that we're not
[1:16:06] together no more.
[1:16:10] Oh no." And all a sudden anxiety is
[1:16:12] going to start. How am I going to do it?
[1:16:14] I love him, but we're not doing we're
[1:16:17] God's not pleased with our and I got to
[1:16:19] tell I can't Well, maybe we'll just just
[1:16:22] witness to just witness to him and maybe
[1:16:24] he'll accept the Holy Ghost and y'all
[1:16:25] can get married. Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
[1:16:29] Yeah, God would be pleased with that.
[1:16:32] Yeah, I just need to go witness to him
[1:16:33] and and uh and everything will be okay.
[1:16:36] Okay, I got to And all of a sudden, what
[1:16:38] happens? that that feeling lifts. And
[1:16:41] all of a sudden, you feel pretty good
[1:16:42] and you're like, I I made the right
[1:16:44] decision. No, no, that was the devil.
[1:16:47] That was a contest.
[1:16:50] You were in the arena. You remember it
[1:16:52] right here. There was a ring here. And
[1:16:55] the devil was standing there trying to
[1:16:57] make you reason with the word. That's
[1:17:00] reasoning. That's doubt. But you got to
[1:17:02] confess it. No, devil. I'm not making a
[1:17:05] deal with the devil. this bride, this
[1:17:08] young people, we are not here to
[1:17:10] negotiate. I want the nine spiritual
[1:17:13] gifts in effect. I want the outpouring
[1:17:16] of the Holy Ghost. I want to be born
[1:17:18] again and filled. I want to live in
[1:17:20] holiness. I want to surrender my vessel
[1:17:22] to Almighty God. I want to be dressed in
[1:17:25] the word of the message.
[1:17:29] Look, I am not for sale. I've already
[1:17:32] been purchased by the blood of my savior
[1:17:35] Jesus Christ.
[1:17:37] [Applause]
[1:17:39] I'm not for sale.
[1:17:44] It's
[1:17:46] amazing how easy we fall.
[1:17:52] Look, you ain't going to pull up to the
[1:17:53] gas station and some guy will come up
[1:17:54] and offer you
[1:17:55] drugs. Hey, that was an easy one. I
[1:17:58] don't even know what they are.
[1:18:03] Come on. It's not easy.
[1:18:09] Some of you when you go home, you need
[1:18:10] to obey your mom and your dad.
[1:18:15] Why are they so hard? It doesn't matter.
[1:18:18] It's your mom and it's your dad. And the
[1:18:21] Holy Ghost in you should say, "Yes, mom.
[1:18:23] Yes, Dad." Hey, I got some girls here.
[1:18:25] You hearing that?
[1:18:29] Why is it so hard?
[1:18:31] Because you got a nature. You want to be
[1:18:34] your own boss. You want to do things
[1:18:36] your way. And many times you don't
[1:18:39] understand why mom and dad believe the
[1:18:40] way they do. Why do they want me to? You
[1:18:42] want me to dress like an old maid?
[1:18:46] Well, if I
[1:18:48] do, it's what your father wants.
[1:18:52] And I would pray, look, fathers, you
[1:18:53] have to have wisdom.
[1:18:56] We need wisdom. This is a youth camp, so
[1:18:59] I'm I'm preaching to your parents right
[1:19:00] now. Amen.
[1:19:02] You can't hold your kids under a thumb
[1:19:04] and you can't do this and can't do that.
[1:19:06] You got to let the Holy Ghost in them
[1:19:08] express itself.
[1:19:11] You're the Holy Ghost for them until
[1:19:13] they get it. Well, how do you know they
[1:19:15] got it? Let them live a little bit. I
[1:19:17] ain't saying like that, you dumb devil.
[1:19:19] But you know what I'm talking about. You
[1:19:20] apply the token, but you let them make
[1:19:22] some decisions theirel and you'll see,
[1:19:24] well, they're not quite ready yet. Or
[1:19:26] they're making some decisions and then
[1:19:27] you can coach them a little bit. say,
[1:19:28] "Honey, I think you might this would be
[1:19:30] a better way." And you watch their life,
[1:19:32] and you train them up in the way they
[1:19:34] should go. But you young people, you
[1:19:37] have a duty and a responsibility. If you
[1:19:38] got the Holy Ghost when you got home,
[1:19:40] you want to serve God and and look,
[1:19:41] you're some of you ain't out in the
[1:19:43] workplace. You ain't out in college. So,
[1:19:47] where's your battleground?
[1:19:52] It's in your house.
[1:19:54] Maybe you're in public school. Maybe
[1:19:56] you're home. Where's your battlefield?
[1:19:58] It's in the car on the way to church
[1:20:00] Sunday morning.
[1:20:02] Man, that could be a wicked battle
[1:20:03] place.
[1:20:07] I never forget it. Just comes to me. You
[1:20:08] know, Sunday morning some things can
[1:20:09] happen and God, this is kind of funny.
[1:20:11] Oh, God forgive me. You know, it was
[1:20:13] really cold and and oh my, I shouldn't
[1:20:16] say it. You know, it was really cold and
[1:20:17] I was going to get to church really
[1:20:18] early and I I thought, you know what? I
[1:20:20] made two yetis of coffee and I said,
[1:20:23] man, maybe I said it like this for fun.
[1:20:25] I got a double
[1:20:26] portion. And I walked out that door and
[1:20:28] I went over to my truck and there was a
[1:20:30] little patch of
[1:20:32] ice. Whoop! One went right into my
[1:20:36] truck, the other hit the
[1:20:38] ground. And I got up and I'm like, "You
[1:20:40] got to be kidding me. I was going to be
[1:20:43] early." Isn't it funny how no matter
[1:20:45] what you do,
[1:20:48] I mean, you finally I'm going to be
[1:20:50] early to church today. Hallelujah.
[1:20:54] And it's strange. The further you live
[1:20:56] away, the more on time you could be. And
[1:20:57] the closer you live to church, the later
[1:20:59] you are.
[1:21:01] [Applause]
[1:21:04] And it's funny because the devil ain't
[1:21:06] got Hey, this is awesome. The devil
[1:21:08] ain't got time to mess your car right
[1:21:09] up, so he does it in your home.
[1:21:12] And everything in your home's a wreck
[1:21:14] because you got to walk to church
[1:21:17] or your drive is only two minutes away,
[1:21:19] which mine was, and I still managed to
[1:21:21] mess it up.
[1:21:24] Those those things sound those those
[1:21:27] things sound insignificant, but you know
[1:21:29] what? And all of those things, we want
[1:21:31] to be we want to be doing battle,
[1:21:34] so you know, because the devil will take
[1:21:36] some of the smallest things,
[1:21:41] you know, I mean, I I only put on one
[1:21:44] outfit in the morning on Sunday, but I
[1:21:47] don't know. Girls, I think they like to
[1:21:49] try on 15 or 20.
[1:21:53] Like I'm pretty good. I mean, it looked
[1:21:54] good to them the day before, but that
[1:21:56] morning it didn't look good. I mean, us
[1:21:58] guys were I mean, I'm pretty good. It's
[1:22:00] the same suit, the same tie, and I'm the
[1:22:02] same guy.
[1:22:04] I mean, whether it's Friday, Sunday,
[1:22:05] Monday, it don't make any difference.
[1:22:07] It's going to look the same. But girls,
[1:22:08] nope. That outfit, it looks different on
[1:22:11] Wednesday, but it sure look different on
[1:22:12] Friday or so. I don't know what it is.
[1:22:14] But what I know one thing it does, it
[1:22:15] makes you late.
[1:22:22] Hey, and it can be something like that.
[1:22:23] All of a sudden, this doesn't go wrong
[1:22:25] and your hair ain't cooperating and you
[1:22:27] get to church and you got no expectation
[1:22:29] and you're flustered. They're trying to
[1:22:31] teach you how to fight.
[1:22:34] You got to wake up fighting.
[1:22:36] You got to drive fighting.
[1:22:39] You got to go to church. Fighting, you
[1:22:41] got to leave church. Fighting, you got
[1:22:43] to go to school. Fighting you got to go
[1:22:45] to work. Fighting you got to eat your
[1:22:47] food. fighting. Hey, that sounds like
[1:22:49] the book of Nehemiah. They had a sword
[1:22:50] in one end and they were working with
[1:22:52] the other line because they were doing
[1:22:54] warfare. Look, friends, you're called to
[1:22:56] fight, but don't be discouraged. You're
[1:22:58] anointed for the job.
[1:23:03] There's an anointing here.
[1:23:09] God is with you.
[1:23:18] You don't have to fear. The never
[1:23:20] failing presence of God is with you
[1:23:23] wherever you go. Prophet of God would
[1:23:25] say this in proof of his resurrection.
[1:23:26] Jesus said, "The Father that sent me is
[1:23:28] is with me." Oh my, what a declaration.
[1:23:31] What a word. The Father that sent me
[1:23:33] come with me. Listen. And as the father
[1:23:36] sent me, so do I send you. He don't only
[1:23:38] send you, but he goes with you. I'll be
[1:23:41] with you even in you until the end of
[1:23:42] the world. All that was in God, he
[1:23:44] poured out in the h poured out in
[1:23:46] Christ. And all that was in Christ, he
[1:23:48] emptied out into the believer of the
[1:23:49] church. God is with you. Amen. Lord, I
[1:23:53] am with thee always, even to the end of
[1:23:55] the world. That's the declaration of
[1:23:56] God's word. That's what the Bible said.
[1:23:58] That's what I believe. Look, God is with
[1:24:01] you. You are not alone. I said you are
[1:24:05] not alone.
[1:24:07] How do you know? Because he said so.
[1:24:10] [Music]
[1:24:11] How do you know? because he said so.
[1:24:13] Amen. God is with you until you make a
[1:24:16] mistake. No, sir. God is with you if you
[1:24:20] make all the right decisions. No, sir.
[1:24:22] God is with you if you pray three times
[1:24:24] a day. God is with you until you walk
[1:24:27] away from him. No, sir. No. God is with
[1:24:32] you. How did Joshua know that God was
[1:24:35] with him? Because God said, Joshua, as I
[1:24:38] was with Moses, I will be with you. and
[1:24:42] pride. As God was with William Platam,
[1:24:45] he will be with you. As God was with you
[1:24:48] in this camp, he will be with you. You
[1:24:50] are not alone. You are not going back to
[1:24:52] fight Goliath on your own. You are not
[1:24:54] going back to your church and going back
[1:24:56] to your school. You're with him. You are
[1:24:58] with Jehovah. You are with the Holy
[1:25:01] Ghost. You are walking with Jehovah.
[1:25:04] You are not alone. And God wants to use
[1:25:08] your hands and your feet to defeat the
[1:25:11] enemy.
[1:25:12] Yes, sir. He's with you to anoint you.
[1:25:16] And I'm not talking about a feeling or
[1:25:18] an emotion.
[1:25:22] I'm talking about a promise.
[1:25:25] He said, "I'll never leave you nor
[1:25:26] forsake thee." Jesus said, "As my father
[1:25:29] has sent me, even so I send you." Yeah.
[1:25:32] As the father sent
[1:25:33] me, I'm sending you the same way.
[1:25:38] How did God send him? What did he do
[1:25:41] when he come in there and took the
[1:25:43] scroll? He took the book. I said he took
[1:25:46] the book. He took the book. And he said,
[1:25:50] "The spirit of the Lord is upon me.
[1:25:53] He hath anointed me
[1:25:56] so that I might do what I've been sent
[1:25:59] to do. Yeah. He has anointed me to
[1:26:02] preach the gospel, to bind up the
[1:26:04] brokenhearted, to set up liberty those.
[1:26:08] Come on.
[1:26:10] And he's telling you the same way the
[1:26:12] father sent me. Are you hearing me?
[1:26:16] The same way that Jesus was sent, the
[1:26:18] same way that Jesus was anointed, he
[1:26:20] says, the same way the father sent me,
[1:26:22] I'm sending you. I'm going to anoint
[1:26:24] you. I'm going to give you my word. I
[1:26:27] will be with you. Amen. Amen. Come on.
[1:26:32] He says this in Christ the mystery of
[1:26:33] God revealed the father that sent him in
[1:26:35] him to vindicate himself. Right? He was
[1:26:37] the word and the same Jesus that sent
[1:26:40] you goes with you and in you to
[1:26:42] vindicate the same God. As the father
[1:26:44] has sent me and I live by the father, so
[1:26:45] I send you and live by me. What is he?
[1:26:48] He is the word. You live by the word. I
[1:26:52] said you live by the word. You don't
[1:26:54] live by your your feelings. You don't
[1:26:56] live by your emotions. Come on. But you
[1:26:58] have emotions. Because you're living.
[1:27:00] Yes, sir.
[1:27:03] Right. But you don't live by them.
[1:27:07] Why? Because your feelings will let you
[1:27:08] down.
[1:27:10] Emotions will let you down.
[1:27:14] Preachers will let you down. Your family
[1:27:16] might let you down. Your church might
[1:27:17] let you down. All of those things might
[1:27:20] let you down. But there's one thing that
[1:27:22] will never let you down. And that is the
[1:27:24] word of God. Jesus Christ will never let
[1:27:27] you down. And when all of those things
[1:27:28] let you down, he will pick you up.
[1:27:32] I said he will pick you up and he will
[1:27:34] never leave you nor forsake you.
[1:27:38] Amen.
[1:27:40] In our text, we're just moving towards
[1:27:42] something. He says, "Don't fear to go
[1:27:43] anywhere and don't fear to do anything
[1:27:45] for the never failing presence of Jesus
[1:27:47] Christ is with you wherever you go."
[1:27:49] That settled it with me. Let them rage.
[1:27:51] I got an absolute my anchor hold yonder
[1:27:54] because it's the word of the living God.
[1:27:56] Jesus said, "It is the spirit that
[1:27:57] quickenth. The flesh profiteth nothing.
[1:27:59] The words that I speak unto you, they
[1:28:00] are spirit and they are life." Yeah.
[1:28:03] Now, I love this quote here. I use it
[1:28:05] quite often in a paradox. Brother
[1:28:07] Brandon says, "Christ is the word." And
[1:28:09] we all know the anointing is Christ that
[1:28:12] comes on the word that makes the word
[1:28:14] live.
[1:28:16] Is that right? That is the anointing.
[1:28:18] Christ is the anointing. The spirit that
[1:28:20] comes upon the word that quickens the
[1:28:21] word to make it alive. Now the word is
[1:28:23] in your heart. You believe in divine
[1:28:25] healing and whatever more see and Christ
[1:28:27] the anointing coming to his body. See
[1:28:30] the connection there. Just like husband
[1:28:31] and wife become one. Now the church has
[1:28:33] got to get to a ministry until the
[1:28:36] church and Christ become one. Amen. He
[1:28:39] can anoint you for every blessing that's
[1:28:42] in the Bible. All of it's yours.
[1:28:45] Everything is promised at this age is
[1:28:48] yours.
[1:28:50] Now, we've had a good time. We've had
[1:28:53] great deliverances.
[1:28:55] There's been those that have been filled
[1:28:56] with the Holy Ghost, and we've whooped
[1:28:58] some devils.
[1:28:59] Hey, I said we've whooped some devils.
[1:29:03] But I want to say, we're just getting
[1:29:05] started.
[1:29:08] We We've turned the corner. But you know
[1:29:11] when you get
[1:29:13] home as they did that skit, what were
[1:29:15] what were those young ladies doing? They
[1:29:17] were training.
[1:29:18] Keep reading. Keep praying.
[1:29:23] Just keep washing windows.
[1:29:26] If God give you a job to do, you're
[1:29:28] anointed to do the job. Look, I don't
[1:29:30] know how how anointed Cartright felt
[1:29:32] washing windows.
[1:29:35] I I bet doing the chores at home, you
[1:29:37] don't feel anointed.
[1:29:39] You know, when you're out there mowing
[1:29:41] the lawn cuz dad told you to mow the
[1:29:42] lawn. I remember one time, I mean, I was
[1:29:44] going to be a good little boy. I said,
[1:29:47] "You know what? I'm going to mow the
[1:29:49] lawn for my dad." And I got all ready. I
[1:29:52] started to walk out the door and he
[1:29:53] goes, "Son, mow the lawn for
[1:29:55] me." Took all the
[1:30:01] joy right out of it. I didn't want to
[1:30:04] mow the lawn anymore. I turned it. I
[1:30:07] went from a good boy to a bad boy. I
[1:30:08] don't I got him on the lawn. I don't
[1:30:10] want him on the lawn. I didn't want to
[1:30:12] do it cuz the father asked me to do it.
[1:30:14] Isn't that strange how that works?
[1:30:21] And we don't want to do our chores. We
[1:30:23] want big things.
[1:30:26] I John Carr, right? I you know I I I
[1:30:29] doubt he felt anointed washing windows,
[1:30:32] but he had a job to do.
[1:30:35] What was he doing? He was doing what God
[1:30:38] told him. Young people, you got to go
[1:30:40] back home and do what God told you to
[1:30:43] do. And you know what'll happen if a
[1:30:45] Goliath shows up.
[1:30:48] You don't have to try to work something
[1:30:50] up. God will send something down and
[1:30:53] anoint that whatever's already in you.
[1:30:55] And you say, "Well, devil, if you're
[1:30:57] going to try to stop me from praising my
[1:30:59] God, if you're going to stop me from
[1:31:01] trying to serve God, if you're going to
[1:31:02] try to make me giving again, well, I'll
[1:31:04] just get done mowing alone and then I'm
[1:31:06] going to whoop you, devil. I'm going to
[1:31:08] get on top of you, and I'mma pound the
[1:31:10] toe out you. The same God that was with
[1:31:12] me at camp. Is the same God that's with
[1:31:14] me when I'm washing windows. It's the
[1:31:16] same God that goes with me at school.
[1:31:18] Cuz I am anointed. I might not feel
[1:31:20] anointed, but I am anointed. I'm
[1:31:24] anointed for the church. You're anointed
[1:31:26] for the job. You're anointed to put
[1:31:29] every devil under your feet.
[1:31:33] Hallelujah.
[1:31:36] You might not feel like
[1:31:40] it, but God said if thou can believe,
[1:31:44] he's here to anoint
[1:31:46] you for every blessing of the age.
[1:31:54] Hey, come on. Put your order in.
[1:31:58] Every blessing in the Hey, man. That
[1:32:00] sounds like salvation,
[1:32:03] sanctification,
[1:32:05] Holy Ghost, joy, victory, turning my
[1:32:08] mourning into dancing. You know what
[1:32:10] else is promised for this age? Hey, body
[1:32:12] change is promised for this age. Hey,
[1:32:15] raptures. You know what? God's anointing
[1:32:17] me for rapture. He's anointing me for a
[1:32:20] body change. Well, he's going to anoint
[1:32:22] me so much that I can be changed in a
[1:32:24] moment, a twinkling of an eye. What do
[1:32:25] you got, devil? Bring it on. I've been
[1:32:27] trained how to fight because I fight by
[1:32:30] the word of the Lord, not how I feel,
[1:32:32] not by some emotion. I fight by the
[1:32:34] word. And if I need to feel the
[1:32:35] anointing, God will pour it out. I'll
[1:32:37] get so anointed. I don't know where I am
[1:32:40] or what I'm doing. I'll be so far away
[1:32:42] from this sense bound existence in the
[1:32:44] eternal realm. That old devil say, "Hey,
[1:32:46] that one's just like Jesus."
[1:32:49] Because it ain't me. that's fighting.
[1:32:51] It's greater is he that is in you than
[1:32:54] that depression. Greater is he that is
[1:32:56] in you than that anxiety. Greater is he
[1:32:59] that is in you than that pornography.
[1:33:01] Greater than is he that is in you than
[1:33:03] that Goliath.
[1:33:05] Come on. The prophet of God said, "Every
[1:33:07] one of you sitting here is David's.
[1:33:12] He's anointed you for the job."
[1:33:16] He said, "Where is the Goliath?
[1:33:21] that's making its boast.
[1:33:23] You know what the prophet of God
[1:33:25] said? Challenge him to a showdown.
[1:33:30] He said, "Oh, I feel religious.
[1:33:34] challenge him to a showdown. Because the
[1:33:37] same Jesus Christ that set you free at
[1:33:40] Dry Creek, Louisiana, is the same Jesus
[1:33:43] Christ that goes with you and in you to
[1:33:45] anoint you
[1:33:47] for the job. You're going to go into the
[1:33:50] valley. But I want to tell you, where
[1:33:52] did David meet Goliath? In the valley.
[1:33:56] He had to walk away from the camp.
[1:34:00] He had to go down into the valley. Come
[1:34:03] on.
[1:34:05] And he stood there.
[1:34:08] Imano immano.
[1:34:11] But David was not alone.
[1:34:14] He said, "You meet me
[1:34:17] in the name of your Philistine gods, but
[1:34:19] I meet you in the name of the Lord God
[1:34:20] of Israel."
[1:34:22] And the same God that delivered me at
[1:34:25] Dry Creek, Louisiana camp in 2025. The
[1:34:28] same God that gave me an experience when
[1:34:30] I was a 12year-old boy. The same God
[1:34:33] that filled me with the Holy Ghost. The
[1:34:35] same presence of God I felt when I went
[1:34:37] 80 feet from here to over there and I
[1:34:40] got my healing. What God has done for
[1:34:42] others. Oh, I know he has done for me.
[1:34:45] And the same God that did that for me is
[1:34:47] going to whoop you, devil. Oh, I'm going
[1:34:49] to challenge you to a shower at my work,
[1:34:52] at my school, in my car, in my private
[1:34:56] life.
[1:34:58] Hey, I'm talking about being so filled
[1:35:00] and anointed with the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:07] Hey, if the prophet said it, I believe
[1:35:09] it. You can challenge that devil to a
[1:35:12] showdown.
[1:35:13] Now, I'm not trying to talk about going
[1:35:15] looking for de for trouble. Don't Don't
[1:35:18] be dumb.
[1:35:21] But when he shows up knocking,
[1:35:27] Peter Carr, is that his name?
[1:35:32] He wasn't looking for the bully.
[1:35:36] He was doing his job.
[1:35:39] He was doing what he was anointed to do.
[1:35:43] And when he needed a greater power,
[1:35:46] it was there when he needed it.
[1:35:50] Oh, I feel pretty good right now.
[1:35:54] It'll be there when you need it.
[1:35:57] I said it'll be there when you need it.
[1:35:59] You ain't got to fear nothing.
[1:36:02] You ain't got to wonder.
[1:36:04] It'll be there when you need it. You
[1:36:07] don't have to worry about missing the
[1:36:08] rapture. It'll be there when you need
[1:36:10] it. You don't have to worry about those
[1:36:13] things. God is with you. Look, y'all
[1:36:15] can't go in the rapture without me. And
[1:36:17] if I go in by the way of the grave,
[1:36:19] guess what? I'm going to get there first
[1:36:23] cuz I'm coming up. Hey, that's what
[1:36:25] Easter says. I'm coming up. I'm going to
[1:36:28] be changed. Amen.
[1:36:32] David said, "Though I walk through the
[1:36:34] valley of a shadow of death." Where does
[1:36:35] time go? David said, "Though I walk
[1:36:38] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:36:39] death, I will fear no
[1:36:41] evil because thou art with me."
[1:36:47] He hast anointed me.
[1:36:51] Now, I know some people might want to be
[1:36:53] a little bit critical, but look, I I'm
[1:36:56] not I'm not talking about some feeling
[1:36:58] or emotion.
[1:37:01] Look, I love them. And, you know, I
[1:37:03] ain't got to talk about those things,
[1:37:04] but I I'm talking about when you need
[1:37:05] it. I love to rejoice. I I I I love to
[1:37:09] express myself to my Lord and Savior.
[1:37:11] But those things, they come and go.
[1:37:13] Yeah. But when you get down into the
[1:37:15] deep waters and you get in that trial
[1:37:17] and you're facing that Goliath, you need
[1:37:19] something more than just say, "Well, I
[1:37:20] got excited."
[1:37:22] And you're going to have to do battle
[1:37:24] and you're going to have to know what
[1:37:25] you're talking about. That's what I love
[1:37:27] about car. He knew what he was talking
[1:37:29] about. He God told him to to go to
[1:37:31] school. God told him to obey his
[1:37:32] parents. God told him to go to church.
[1:37:34] So, he was just doing what God told him
[1:37:36] to do. And when that Goliath showed up
[1:37:38] and said, "What are you doing?
[1:37:41] I'm a born again son of God. I'm going
[1:37:44] to school. I'm a born again daughter of
[1:37:46] God. I I I'm I'm dressing in holiness.
[1:37:49] No. No, you ain't. Not around here.
[1:37:52] You're not.
[1:37:53] You ain't going to do
[1:37:55] that. Well, yeah. God told me to. Well,
[1:37:59] you'll have to beat me up first. Okay.
[1:38:02] All right. Well, I'm going to finish
[1:38:03] what God told me to do and then I'll
[1:38:04] whoop you next. That's right.
[1:38:08] Amen.
[1:38:09] He He didn't have to He didn't have to
[1:38:11] stop what he was doing and say, "Oh, now
[1:38:13] Lord, this man has come up and he's
[1:38:16] trying to stop me from doing what you
[1:38:18] told me to do." You You ever heard the
[1:38:19] message, "Why Christ speak?"
[1:38:22] Come on. When you come up to a Red Sea,
[1:38:24] then we are not baby fashioned. We are
[1:38:26] not a Corinthian church. The prophet of
[1:38:28] God said the Corinthian church, they
[1:38:29] were baby fashioned. Yeah. He said they
[1:38:32] they they could believe but they would
[1:38:34] believe everything in the wrong thing.
[1:38:36] Come on.
[1:38:38] He said that's the problem with the
[1:38:40] Christian church. We've just become like
[1:38:42] babies. We've become copycats.
[1:38:46] We like secondhand revelation.
[1:38:49] We We just copy what the next guy's
[1:38:51] doing and we feel all right. Yeah. You
[1:38:53] You will fail the test. My wife can tell
[1:38:56] you a funny story about that.
[1:39:00] You copy somebody's test, you think
[1:39:01] they're going to pass.
[1:39:04] You better watch out. You might have
[1:39:06] been better off on your own.
[1:39:08] Yes, sir. But you don't want to mimic.
[1:39:10] You don't want to copy. I was thinking
[1:39:12] about that. I remember I I remember I
[1:39:14] got a copy of the pillar of fire and and
[1:39:16] I love the picture, man. I I I got a
[1:39:18] picture of the cloud and I love the
[1:39:20] copy, but you know what? I I like the
[1:39:23] picture, but I want more than a copy.
[1:39:26] I just don't want a copy of the pillar
[1:39:28] of fire. I need the pillar of fire. I
[1:39:31] need the Holy Ghost in my life. Look, I
[1:39:33] I I love the books. I love the tapes. I
[1:39:36] love the word. But I need the dynamics
[1:39:38] to come to the mechanics and make that
[1:39:41] word live.
[1:39:51] Prophet of God said this and why Christ
[1:39:53] speak. He said he was
[1:39:56] anointed. The God that delivered me from
[1:39:58] that lion. That God delivered me from
[1:40:01] the paws of that bear. He'll more than
[1:40:03] deliver me from that Philistine. Here I
[1:40:06] come. I meet you in the name of the Lord
[1:40:08] God of Israel. Amen. He didn't pray
[1:40:11] through. He was already prayed
[1:40:14] through. God prayed him through before
[1:40:17] the foundation of the world. He was
[1:40:19] anointed for the job.
[1:40:23] Quit your crying.
[1:40:26] You've cried long enough. God has showed
[1:40:29] up. I think now it's time for you to
[1:40:31] confess.
[1:40:33] Why cry? Speak and go forward.
[1:40:39] You accept it. You believe it. Now
[1:40:42] confess it. Speak and go forward. Come
[1:40:44] on, young people.
[1:40:46] Look, you're going to have to fight when
[1:40:48] you go back home.
[1:40:50] You're going to find your places where
[1:40:51] you're all alone and you're going to
[1:40:52] have to fight,
[1:40:56] but God has anointed you for the job.
[1:41:00] God has chosen you. Amen to defeat the
[1:41:06] devil. Some of us need to be like
[1:41:08] Shamgar.
[1:41:12] You know, he got
[1:41:13] tired of being robbed of his joy.
[1:41:17] May let God talk to somebody right now.
[1:41:20] Somebody here is tired of going back
[1:41:23] home from camp and being robbed of your
[1:41:25] joy every time and being robbed of your
[1:41:29] victory every time.
[1:41:33] And you're sick and tired of those
[1:41:35] Philistines and all those spirits coming
[1:41:37] back and robbing you of your joy,
[1:41:40] robbing you of your peace.
[1:41:43] You know what you need to do? You know
[1:41:44] what the prophet of God said about
[1:41:45] Shamgar? He said the spirit of the Lord
[1:41:48] started to move upon him and he got
[1:41:51] angry.
[1:41:55] What?
[1:41:57] Yeah. The spirit of God moved upon
[1:42:00] Shamgar and he got angry.
[1:42:05] Look, friends, I've been there. I
[1:42:08] remember when I was 21 years old, I made
[1:42:10] a decision to serve God. I I was in
[1:42:13] bondage. I was in a place where where I
[1:42:15] needed deliverance and I was trying. And
[1:42:18] I remember I made a decision that I
[1:42:19] wasn't going to do it anymore. And there
[1:42:22] was another nature, another spirit
[1:42:24] there.
[1:42:27] And it said, "I'll get you back out in
[1:42:29] the world with music and TV."
[1:42:33] And I said, "A
[1:42:35] man, here we go again. Another
[1:42:38] cycle." Uhuh. I said, "You're going to
[1:42:41] what?
[1:42:43] you're going to get me. You know, if I
[1:42:45] could say it like this, I didn't realize
[1:42:47] what was happening.
[1:42:50] But the spirit of God started to move
[1:42:52] upon me
[1:42:54] because a son of God said,
[1:42:57] "Lord, I need your help."
[1:43:02] And the spirit of God started to move
[1:43:03] down. And there became a contest.
[1:43:07] There became a battle in the
[1:43:08] supernatural realm. I didn't even know.
[1:43:11] And then that nature came up and said,
[1:43:12] "I'll get you back out in the world with
[1:43:14] music and TV." And all of a sudden,
[1:43:16] something to me said, "I don't want to
[1:43:18] go back. You're not going to get me. I'm
[1:43:21] going to get you." And I jumped out of
[1:43:24] my
[1:43:25] car. I ran back into my house. I didn't
[1:43:28] even know what I was doing. I was
[1:43:30] looking for something. I said, "You're
[1:43:32] not going to get me. I'm going to get
[1:43:34] you." And I found a big old pair of bolt
[1:43:36] cutters. I ran into my room and there
[1:43:38] was that TV. the devil said he was going
[1:43:39] to get me back out in the world with.
[1:43:41] And I took them that my bulk runners and
[1:43:43] I broke that TV and I said, "How you
[1:43:46] like me now?"
[1:43:48] And I've been trying to slay devils ever
[1:43:50] since. I might have fallen, but I got
[1:43:53] back up. I may have made a mistake, but
[1:43:55] I got back up. Why? Because I'm anointed
[1:43:57] for the job. I'm anointed for victory in
[1:44:00] the valley. Boo, devil, come too late.
[1:44:04] God's already got a hold of my life.
[1:44:07] I might fall. I might make mistakes. But
[1:44:10] I'm going to get back up because I'm
[1:44:12] anointed for the job. You are anointed.
[1:44:17] [Applause]
[1:44:20] How you like me now.
[1:44:24] Hey, I feel pretty good right now saying
[1:44:26] that. Devil, you tried to stop me, but
[1:44:29] you couldn't. How you like me now, you
[1:44:32] couldn't stop me then. You couldn't stop
[1:44:35] me back there and you can't stop me now,
[1:44:37] Brother Ron. The devil can't stop you,
[1:44:39] Brother Tim. The devil can't stop you,
[1:44:42] young people. The devil can't stop you.
[1:44:46] You're anointed for the job. You're
[1:44:48] anointed for every blessing in the
[1:44:50] Bible. You're anointed for a rapture.
[1:44:53] You're anointed to take the devil's head
[1:44:55] off.
[1:44:58] Oh, glory to God. Somebody, you just
[1:45:01] need to speak it out.
[1:45:04] Speak to your mountain. Confess it.
[1:45:10] Prophet of God says it like this. I love
[1:45:12] it. If you find out, young
[1:45:16] people, your life is in the message.
[1:45:21] Your life is in the Bible.
[1:45:27] Well, we're at the very end. So, we're
[1:45:29] going to be the ones that are caught
[1:45:30] away. We're running the final lap.
[1:45:33] You're anointed for the job. You're the
[1:45:34] man in the arena. You You've turned the
[1:45:36] corner. It's I mean, we're the last
[1:45:38] leg. You're going up heartbreak heal.
[1:45:41] And it man, it feels like you ain't
[1:45:42] going to be able to make
[1:45:43] it, but you're anointed.
[1:45:47] You're anointed for the job. And I like
[1:45:50] how the prophet of God says this. We'll
[1:45:52] try to bring it towards a close.
[1:45:54] Hey, we're on the final lap. Y'all
[1:45:56] ready? This is it. We got to conclude
[1:45:59] 2025 with youth camp. But it's been a
[1:46:01] good youth camp. But I say, "God ain't
[1:46:03] done yet."
[1:46:05] And and it just hits me now. I just want
[1:46:07] to share
[1:46:08] this. Last night, I was I was just
[1:46:11] laying there as I was going to bed
[1:46:14] and and I I just was saying, "Lord, what
[1:46:17] would you have? I I just need something
[1:46:20] for your young people." And I just felt
[1:46:23] a little voice say, "Go get my lamb."
[1:46:26] And you know, I was really tired.
[1:46:28] Usually you like to maybe jot that down.
[1:46:30] And I just thought, Lord, I just
[1:46:33] pondered on. I fell asleep. And when I
[1:46:36] woke
[1:46:37] up, go get my lamb. I laid there. I
[1:46:40] said, Lord, go get your lamb. And and
[1:46:42] all of a sudden, I kind of started to
[1:46:43] think of Georgia
[1:46:46] Carter. And I God told him said, "I got
[1:46:48] a lamb down there. She's crying
[1:46:51] out and she's caught up and she's hung
[1:46:54] up in
[1:46:55] something. Look, look, somebody here,
[1:46:57] you're still caught up and hung up.
[1:47:02] But it ain't over.
[1:47:04] I know it's Sunday morning, but it's
[1:47:06] resurrection morning and it ain't over.
[1:47:09] I come to camp to fight and I'm still
[1:47:12] fighting. I'm going to leave camp and
[1:47:15] I'm still going to be fighting. I'm
[1:47:16] going to get back home and I'm still
[1:47:18] going to be fighting. I'm going to fight
[1:47:20] every devil that I can until the change
[1:47:22] of my body. And right now, this morning,
[1:47:24] I'm going to fight for God's little
[1:47:26] lamb. If you are caught up and you are
[1:47:28] hung up, devil, you take your hands off
[1:47:30] that daughter of God. You can't hold her
[1:47:32] any longer. The spirit of the Lord is
[1:47:34] coming for you. Why don't you go ahead
[1:47:36] and believe it, accept it, and confess
[1:47:38] it right now and say, "I am
[1:47:41] free." Devil, take your hands off of
[1:47:44] God's property. This is the pride of
[1:47:46] Jesus Christ. She has been anointed for
[1:47:48] victory. You have been anointed to go
[1:47:51] into body change. You have been anointed
[1:47:53] to put every devil under your feet.
[1:47:55] House of hell, give way in the name of
[1:47:58] Jesus Christ. You're anointed for the
[1:48:01] job, young
[1:48:04] people. Oh, why don't you speak it
[1:48:11] out? Hey, I feel him right now.
[1:48:14] Come on. Right. Victory is in the
[1:48:16] building.
[1:48:18] Victory is in the building.
[1:48:22] The mighty conqueror is here to loose
[1:48:25] you to free you.
[1:48:30] You don't got to take them complexes
[1:48:32] back home.
[1:48:37] You're free.
[1:48:40] I said you're free this morning.
[1:48:48] That's what victory sounds like. You
[1:48:50] ever had it? You ever had a little
[1:48:53] victory? Has your mourning ever been
[1:48:56] turned into dancing? Do you know what
[1:48:59] it's like to be set free? Do you know
[1:49:01] what it's like to be once in sin? And
[1:49:04] then the great Jehovah come down and he
[1:49:06] break the shackles of hell off of your
[1:49:09] life and he anointed you to fly. Fly,
[1:49:12] little eagles,
[1:49:14] fly. Hey, the heavens are up there. Get
[1:49:17] in it. Go fly. Fly away little eagles.
[1:49:22] You're
[1:49:23] free. I said you're free this morning.
[1:49:27] The mighty conqueror is in the
[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:35] building. Your musicians would come.
[1:49:47] how you like me now.
[1:49:50] That just sounds different now that I'm
[1:49:52] up here.
[1:49:54] You don't know the valleys I've been
[1:49:57] through.
[1:49:59] You don't know the hurt that I've been
[1:50:01] through. You don't know the pain that
[1:50:04] I've been through. You don't know the
[1:50:06] anguish that I've been through. But I'm
[1:50:08] standing here. Why? Because the mighty
[1:50:12] conqueror has
[1:50:28] risen. Prophet of God said, "All
[1:50:32] right." I say, I say you can find your
[1:50:36] story in the Bible.
[1:50:38] You can find your story in the message.
[1:50:41] And the more I
[1:50:42] study, the more I realize I don't know,
[1:50:45] but the more I find out about him and
[1:50:47] the more I find out about me.
[1:50:50] And the other day, I was just reading my
[1:50:51] testimony. The prophet of God says, "All
[1:50:53] right, I open up my heart and my mind.
[1:50:56] Come in, Lord Jesus, and grab the faith,
[1:50:59] the sword of the spirit. Thus sayith the
[1:51:01] Lord, scream,
[1:51:04] hallelujah." Amen. Then cut down every
[1:51:07] enemy in front of you.
[1:51:10] I think somebody's missing the first
[1:51:12] step.
[1:51:13] [Music]
[1:51:16] Grab the faith, the sword of the spirit.
[1:51:19] Thus sayith the Lord.
[1:51:21] Scream hallelujah.
[1:51:24] And then cut down every enemy in front
[1:51:28] of you. Go to cutting. Go to chopping.
[1:51:32] How you like me now, devil? I'm gonna
[1:51:35] keep cutting. I'm gonna keep chopping.
[1:51:38] I'm gonna keep screaming.
[1:51:41] Hallelujah.
[1:51:43] Hallelujah.
[1:51:44] Hallelujah.
[1:51:46] Hallelujah.
[1:51:48] Hallelujah.
[1:51:49] Hallelujah.
[1:51:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:51:58] [Music]
[1:52:03] It ain't time to let
[1:52:05] up. It ain't time to shrink back.
[1:52:10] It's time to fight.
[1:52:13] And we still got some fighting to
[1:52:17] do. Prophet of God said, "Let's not use
[1:52:21] a .22 rifle.
[1:52:24] Let's get the atomic bomb of faith in
[1:52:28] his word.
[1:52:32] He said when that bomb of faith drops in
[1:52:35] there, the word of God behind it, it
[1:52:37] blows every devil, every sickness, every
[1:52:40] disease. Boom, devil. Hallelujah.
[1:52:45] [Applause]
[1:52:48] [Music]
[1:52:49] He says, "Amen." There it is. Cut every
[1:52:52] enemy. If an old spooky spirit may Oh,
[1:52:55] I'm feeling pretty good right now. Hey,
[1:52:57] I've turned the corner and I'm coming
[1:52:58] full circle right now.
[1:53:01] Oh, devil. You are defeated in the name
[1:53:04] of Jesus Christ.
[1:53:08] Oh, thank you, God. You do all things
[1:53:12] well, Lord. Everything you do is
[1:53:16] perfect. There it is. T every enemy. If
[1:53:19] an old spooky spirit making you feel,
[1:53:21] cut that thing away with your
[1:53:26] emotions, with your feelings,
[1:53:29] with what you know.
[1:53:31] Cut that thing away with the word of the
[1:53:34] Lord.
[1:53:39] Our strength is the joy of the Lord. Get
[1:53:42] away from me. Whack. You cut him with
[1:53:45] the word. Whether it be a demon, whether
[1:53:47] it be an enemy, whether it be a
[1:53:48] sickness, whether it be a disease,
[1:53:50] whatever it is, take that word and pull
[1:53:53] that sword. And if you whack it the
[1:53:55] first time and it don't seem to move,
[1:53:57] whack it again. Whack it again. Whack it
[1:54:00] again. Whack it again until you chip a
[1:54:03] hole through it like the eagle that you
[1:54:05] are. Beep yourself right on through that
[1:54:08] old shell of sickness. Cut your way out
[1:54:11] and say, "Hallelujah.
[1:54:14] There's the next
[1:54:19] one. Challenge that devil. Hey, I feel
[1:54:22] pretty
[1:54:23] good. I got delivered from sickness. I
[1:54:27] got delivered from demons. I got
[1:54:29] delivered from depression. I got
[1:54:31] delivered from pornography. I got
[1:54:33] delivered from suicide.
[1:54:35] And you know what the prophet told you
[1:54:37] to do? Scream out, "Hallelujah."
[1:54:40] Hit it with the word. And now that you
[1:54:42] got the victory, say, "Where's the next
[1:54:44] one? I'm hunting you down,
[1:54:47] devil. Where's my next
[1:54:50] one? I'm anointed for the
[1:54:54] [Applause]
[1:55:00] job." Oh, hallelujah.
[1:55:04] Oh, since I
[1:55:06] [Applause]
[1:55:07] lay my burden
[1:55:11] down. Oh, glory,
[1:55:14] glory. Oh,
[1:55:18] hallelujah. Oh, since I
[1:55:22] laid my burden
[1:55:25] down, I'm singing
[1:55:28] hallelujah. Oh, God is able. Hallelujah.
[1:55:33] Oh, God is faithful.
[1:55:36] Hallelujah. Lord, I'm going to
[1:55:40] sing. Oh, as long as I'm alive, there's
[1:55:45] going to be
[1:55:47] praise. Oh, as long as I'm alive,
[1:55:51] there's going to be
[1:55:54] shouting. Oh, one thing that I know.
[1:55:59] Oh, deep down in my
[1:56:02] soul. As long as I'm alive, I'm going to
[1:56:08] sing. I'm singing
[1:56:10] hallelujah. Oh, God is faithful.
[1:56:14] Hallelujah. Oh, God is faithful.
[1:56:18] Hallelujah. Oh, I'm going to
[1:56:20] [Music]
[1:56:23] sing. As long as I'm alive, there's
[1:56:26] going to be
[1:56:28] shout. Oh, as long as I'm alive, there's
[1:56:34] ghost. Oh, one thing I
[1:56:39] know. Oh, deep down in my soul, as long
[1:56:45] as I'm alive, I'm going to
[1:56:49] [Music]
[1:56:51] pray.
[1:56:53] [Applause]
[1:56:54] [Music]
[1:56:55] [Applause]
[1:56:57] [Music]
[1:57:01] Another great event that I wouldn't
[1:57:03] forget to call. That was when David was
[1:57:06] in his worst of time. When he was a
[1:57:10] fugitive, he had already been
[1:57:13] anointed. He knowed what he was to be.
[1:57:16] He was to be king. God said so. And yet
[1:57:21] he was hated. He was standing in between
[1:57:24] two great deep
[1:57:26] fires. Here was the Philistines on one
[1:57:29] side after him. Here was Saul on the
[1:57:33] other side. And he was a man without a
[1:57:36] nation. And just as the church stands
[1:57:39] today, the true living church of God,
[1:57:42] without a denomination or anything else,
[1:57:44] she stands alone.
[1:57:46] But yet she had the anointing poured out
[1:57:48] on her. She knows what she is.
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:57:55] Hey, I don't know about you, but I know
[1:57:56] what I am. I am the bloodbought,
[1:58:00] anointed bride of Jesus Christ to put
[1:58:03] every devil under my feet. Because it is
[1:58:06] not I that liveth, it is Christ that
[1:58:09] liveth in me. What a resurrection that
[1:58:12] was. But what a resurrection this is to
[1:58:15] be quickened by the quickening power of
[1:58:18] almighty God. If that same spirit that
[1:58:21] raised Jesus
[1:58:22] Christ dwells in you, it will quicken
[1:58:26] your mortal body. I think it's time to
[1:58:29] scream. Hallelujah. I know who I am.
[1:58:33] Boo, devil, where's the next one? As
[1:58:37] long as I'm
[1:58:39] alive. I said as long as I'm alive. This
[1:58:42] is one preacher. I'm going to give him
[1:58:44] praise. I'm going to give him glory. Why
[1:58:47] don't you praise him for the
[1:58:49] [Music]
[1:58:57] resurrection? I'll
[1:58:59] sing. Yeah. I feel better.
[1:59:04] Oh, so much
[1:59:07] better since I
[1:59:10] lay my burden
[1:59:13] down. Oh, I feel
[1:59:17] better. Oh, so much
[1:59:20] better. Oh, since I
[1:59:24] lay it
[1:59:27] down, I'm singing
[1:59:29] hallelujah. Oh, God is a hallelujah.
[1:59:34] Oh, God is faithful.
[1:59:37] Hallelujah. Lord, I'm going to
[1:59:40] sing. I'm singing
[1:59:44] [Music]
[1:59:46] hallelujah. Oh, can you say he's
[1:59:49] faithful? Oh Lord, I'm going to sing. As
[1:59:54] long as I'm alive, as long as I'm alive,
[1:59:58] there's going to be shine.
[2:00:01] [Music]
[2:00:09] Oh, one thing that I
[2:00:19] know. Say it
[2:00:21] again. As long as I'm alive, there's
[2:00:25] going to be praise.
[2:00:28] [Music]
[2:00:37] I
[2:00:41] know. Oh, as long as I'm alive, I
[2:00:46] know. Oh, I'm singing
[2:00:50] hallelujah. Oh, God is able.
[2:00:56] [Music]
[2:01:00] Oh. Oh. I'm singing
[2:01:02] [Music]
[2:01:09] hallelujah. Oh
[2:01:11] Lord, I'm going to
[2:01:17] [Music]
[2:01:18] sing hallelujah.
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:24] Hallelujah.
[2:01:26] Hallelujah. Amen. Somebody shout
[2:01:28] hallelujah again.
[2:01:32] Hallelujah.
[2:01:34] Hallelujah.
[2:01:36] [Music]
[2:01:39] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:01:41] Maybe we could just sing
[2:01:45] it.
[2:01:47] Hallelujah. We sang this song last
[2:01:49] night.
[2:01:51] I believe before we go we can sing it
[2:01:54] again. Jesus blinded all my
[2:01:59] darkness, touched my heart
[2:02:02] within his grace and mercy let a
[2:02:07] passion consume my
[2:02:11] sin. And like a hy on a
[2:02:15] hilltop, oh I'll shine through the
[2:02:19] night. I am a lamb made for his
[2:02:23] glory. Oh, I will not
[2:02:27] hide. Oh, I've been touched by a
[2:02:32] fire. Let the world come and watch me
[2:02:39] burn. Shout it.
[2:02:43] [Music]
[2:02:48] Say I've been
[2:02:49] touched. Oh, I've
[2:02:54] [Music]
[2:03:02] been shouting.
[2:03:05] [Music]
[2:03:09] Amen. Could you just lift your hands and
[2:03:10] sing that to me again now? Say, I've
[2:03:12] been touched. Oh, I've been touched by a
[2:03:17] fire. Let the world come and wash
[2:03:24] me. It shouted from the
[2:03:29] rooftop. Shouting to
[2:03:32] him. Oh, one more
[2:03:35] time. Oh, I've been touched by a fire.
[2:03:41] So, let the world Come and watch
[2:03:46] me and shout it from the
[2:03:51] rooftop. Shout it to him. Shout it from
[2:03:55] the
[2:03:56] rooftop.
[2:03:58] Oh, shout it from the rooftop.
[2:04:04] [Music]
[2:04:10] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:04:13] Praise the Lord.
[2:04:16] Wow. Are you ready to fight?
[2:04:19] Amen. God has prepared you for the
[2:04:22] battle. He's equipped you with the word
[2:04:24] of God. It is our sword. Amen. We have
[2:04:28] the shield of faith. We have the helmet
[2:04:30] of salvation. We have our feet that is
[2:04:33] shot with the preparation of the gospel
[2:04:35] of peace. We are called to do battle. He
[2:04:39] didn't give you weapons and and armor
[2:04:42] because um you were just going to cut
[2:04:45] your hand on a a tin can and get a
[2:04:48] citation for it and say, "Oh, you did
[2:04:49] battle." No, sir. You you are here to do
[2:04:52] real warfare. Amen. But you know um you
[2:04:57] know some of you before you came you
[2:04:59] were on the devil's
[2:05:01] side. Now you know something happened.
[2:05:04] You've changed sides. No wonder he's
[2:05:07] against you. But as we have heard this
[2:05:10] morning, greater is he that is in you
[2:05:13] than he that is in the world. And I just
[2:05:16] want to encourage you, you know, um, you
[2:05:19] know, the things that are that you have
[2:05:21] dealt with in your life. Don't go back
[2:05:23] and pick them up again. Instead, you
[2:05:26] know, let's go back and replace those
[2:05:28] things with some really good things.
[2:05:31] Amen. You you there's just too much
[2:05:34] opportunity. We talked about cell phones
[2:05:37] and things like that um today and can be
[2:05:40] your enemy. It can also be a tool that
[2:05:43] you can use for the glory of God. you
[2:05:46] you listen to your your Bible apps and
[2:05:49] if you don't if you don't enjoy reading
[2:05:52] well listen there's even some dramatized
[2:05:55] King James versions and things like that
[2:05:57] that you can do some very very helpful
[2:06:00] things Bible in chronological order that
[2:06:03] you can listen to every day and feed
[2:06:06] your experience
[2:06:08] you know you have an experience with God
[2:06:10] but then you want to feed that
[2:06:13] experience you get the fire that that
[2:06:16] has been started in your heart, but you
[2:06:18] want to add to it the wood of the word
[2:06:21] of God. So, this is very important for
[2:06:24] your your spiritual growth and to build
[2:06:28] upon whatever you receive. Amen. And and
[2:06:32] like you like you heard today, go back
[2:06:34] and testify of it, you know, of what God
[2:06:37] has done. Tell everybody, let the whole
[2:06:39] world know, Amen. that you're you're on
[2:06:41] the winning side now. Amen. So, it's so
[2:06:45] been so good to be here with you and

[2:06:50] wonderful young people that has blessed
[2:06:53] us this weekend and we so appreciate you

[2:07:01] Not one bit of problem, not one
[2:07:03] situation, not one thing that we've had
[2:07:06] to deal with. So, you know, it it's it's
[2:07:08] wonderful because you're wonderful and
[2:07:11] because you also have embraced a
[2:07:14] wonderful savior and we so appreciate
[2:07:17] that. And so, last night we baptized 11
[2:07:21] in the name of the Lord
[2:07:26] Jesus. There's one more going to be
[2:07:28] baptized today. So, they need to go
[2:07:31] ahead and get ready to go to that while
[2:07:34] I make some instructions right now. uh
[2:07:36] up on this and um you know a lot of
[2:07:40] times people you know get a little
[2:07:43] confused about the Holy Ghost and and
[2:07:46] they want just a oneanddone experience
[2:07:49] but I want you to know that it it'll
[2:07:51] come in baptism after baptism of the
[2:07:54] Holy Ghost. So you just whatever that
[2:07:57] you have received don't don't think oh
[2:08:01] well that's that's all of it. you know,
[2:08:03] just keep on and let him feel you again
[2:08:06] and again and again and you just go from
[2:08:10] glory to glory. That's the way you do
[2:08:12] it. Amen. Now, so as we said, we feed on
[2:08:17] the word. We got 1100 and something
[2:08:18] tapes of the prophet of God you can
[2:08:21] listen to. There's there's other other
[2:08:24] um things that you can hear to build it
[2:08:27] up. But I mean, come on. You can't go
[2:08:29] back and just start back with rap music
[2:08:32] again and you know vulgar stuff and
[2:08:35] listening to things. You know I I've
[2:08:37] often said even about country and
[2:08:39] western somebody said uh well it's
[2:08:41] really harmless you know brother Tim
[2:08:43] country music is just life how it really
[2:08:46] is. I said not my life.

[2:08:54] years ago they they had this these uh
[2:08:56] these rock um tapes and and they said,
[2:08:59] "Well, if you played them backwards,
[2:09:00] there was celimal uh messages on them."
[2:09:04] Well, I never I never listen to one
[2:09:06] forward, much less backwards. But
[2:09:08] anyway, this if you play it backwards,
[2:09:10] there's satanic messages on them. I
[2:09:13] said, "Well, you know, I I tell you
[2:09:15] what, I I wish we could play country
[2:09:17] music backwards. A man, you know, man
[2:09:19] would get his wife back again." and his
[2:09:22] tears would be out of his beer and he
[2:09:24] wouldn't need beer no more and you know
[2:09:26] he you know he the children would have
[2:09:28] him with daddy and there would be a home
[2:09:30] and you know all the honky tons would be
[2:09:33] closed
[2:09:35] if we could play it all backwards right
[2:09:38] amen well I tell you what the gospel of
[2:09:40] Jesus Christ amen will propel you
[2:09:43] forward and if you'll listen to the
[2:09:46] right things and feed that experience on
[2:09:50] on the the correct things and you know
[2:09:53] this the flame will just get brighter
[2:09:55] and flow higher and and you know because
[2:09:59] we want it to continue in your life. Now
[2:10:02] you know we have a few people to thank
[2:10:04] today and uh if you'll just be seated
[2:10:07] just a second here. I want to I want to

[2:10:28] sermons that we heard service after
[2:10:31] service. And I want to say to um our
[2:10:34] counselors, I hope you thanked your
[2:10:36] counselors because you know without them
[2:10:39] I could not have camp. And uh if you
[2:10:42] didn't thank your counselor, you find
[2:10:44] them maybe after service if you could

[2:10:58] not have this camp. And also we have the
[2:11:01] deacons. We call it the gator patrol um
[2:11:05] that has uh been the ushers in the

[2:11:11] ones um who who have driven you to camp
[2:11:14] and you know a lot of a lot of different
[2:11:16] ones to say appreciation to. You know
[2:11:19] you don't know it but there's a lot of
[2:11:21] things goes be on behind the scenes.

[2:11:32] people and help you um select the dorms
[2:11:35] and get everything set up for your
[2:11:37] arrival. And then we have um uh days of,
[2:11:41] you know, where the we have to bring all
[2:11:44] the sound equipment to the the
[2:11:46] tabernacle because it's really not
[2:11:49] sufficient what they provide here. And
[2:11:51] so we have to do that and videos and and
[2:11:54] things like that for uh the cameras so

[2:12:16] They're better. They're better than just
[2:12:18] one time. you can hear them over and
[2:12:21] over and over again. So, um, but I mean

[2:12:26] and all that had labored and you know,
[2:12:29] we don't have time to really test it and
[2:12:32] get everything ready and whatever. So,
[2:12:35] you know, first couple of days we had
[2:12:37] some battle with the sound and I don't
[2:12:39] know how cords go bad, you know, that
[2:12:41] that is set in the closet a year, but I
[2:12:44] mean, you know, bring them to camp and
[2:12:46] the devil gets in them. And so, um,
[2:12:51] anyway, anyway, we u we had a little
[2:12:55] little problems with the sound. It's
[2:12:57] always going to be that way because we
[2:12:59] have to come and set up and we had
[2:13:01] musicians this year. Wasn't it
[2:13:03] wonderful? Amen. I tell you, tremendous,
[2:13:08] tremendous talents and gifts given to
[2:13:10] God. Amen. We had a a nurse that come
[2:13:14] here all the way from Florida. It was a
[2:13:16] tremendous blessing that was in the
[2:13:18] nursing station. Amen. We so appreciate
[2:13:23] that. Now, I don't know. It looks like
[2:13:27] there may be a Bible here, something. I
[2:13:30] don't know. Sometimes things get left
[2:13:32] over from year to year, but there's a
[2:13:34] Bible here. Could be yours. I don't
[2:13:36] know. I don't see anything else that
[2:13:38] could have been here from lost and
[2:13:40] found. But um if you have lost something
[2:13:44] and you know or whatever, we'll just
[2:13:47] turn it in now to one of the Gator
[2:13:49] Patrol or me or somebody. And and um you
[2:13:53] know, I don't know. This was a little
[2:13:56] different this year because we didn't
[2:13:58] have the sunrise service at seven and we
[2:14:01] had the 9:30 service. So, you know, you
[2:14:04] didn't have in those sunrise services,
[2:14:06] you didn't have time to pack up. But how
[2:14:09] many of you already have your things
[2:14:11] packed up and out at the out at your car
[2:14:14] and and loaded up? Well, yeah. No. Yep.
[2:14:17] Well, here here's what I want. I don't
[2:14:19] want them left behind. That's what I
[2:14:21] don't, you know. Um, mama paid a lot of
[2:14:24] money for those things and she'll be
[2:14:26] calling me for so well these are my kids
[2:14:29] school clothes and and they're for
[2:14:31] church and I paid a lot of money. Well,
[2:14:34] we got to go look them up and find them
[2:14:35] and you know and sometimes take um um
[2:14:41] you know take take some things home and
[2:14:44] and don't leave it. I I'll just tell
[2:14:46] you, you know, my my kids are now grown
[2:14:49] and they wouldn't look good in your
[2:14:51] underwear. So, take them dirty things
[2:14:53] home with you and mama wants them.
[2:14:55] She'll wash them up and use them another
[2:14:58] time. So, you know, take everything
[2:15:00] home. So, what I want you to do when I
[2:15:04] dismiss you today, I want you to go to
[2:15:07] your
[2:15:08] dorms. Go directly to your dorms. Don't
[2:15:11] pass go and don't get $200 from me.
[2:15:15] I want you to go directly to the dorm
[2:15:18] and I want you to go and get all of
[2:15:23] those things. Yeah. Look under the bed,
[2:15:24] in the shower, everywhere. Get your
[2:15:27] things and listen now. Don't stop to
[2:15:31] fellowship. Don't stop to do this. Don't
[2:15:33] stop to do that. Go and take care of
[2:15:36] your business. Get them out where
[2:15:38] they're to go. If the people aren't
[2:15:39] here, your mother or whoever, dad or
[2:15:41] whoever's picking you up, if they're not
[2:15:43] here yet, well then put them out on the
[2:15:45] porch. Get them out there where you can
[2:15:47] be seen and and get those clothes. Now,
[2:15:52] I know how it is, at least with some of
[2:15:54] the younger ones. So, mama folded all
[2:15:58] those towels, all of those things, and
[2:16:00] it was all night neat and nice and, you
[2:16:04] know, arranged and folded up really nice
[2:16:06] in your suitcase.
[2:16:08] But now they're all a
[2:16:12] mess. And that same stuff is going to
[2:16:15] have to go back in those
[2:16:18] suitcases. So what I want you to do is
[2:16:20] cram all that stuff back in
[2:16:23] there. And then if you have to put your
[2:16:26] knee on the thing and buckle it down and
[2:16:31] then get that thing out of that dorm and
[2:16:33] find that place to get it to your car so
[2:16:36] you nothing is left
[2:16:39] behind. Right.
[2:16:42] Amen. I'm sorry. You know, most of the
[2:16:46] Baptist kids that will be coming using
[2:16:48] this camp next time can't use your
[2:16:49] clothes. So, you know, you take them
[2:16:54] home and and uh mama be happy and I'll
[2:16:59] be happy cuz mama won't be calling
[2:17:02] me. Where are my kids clothes? I said, I
[2:17:05] don't know. I I I I can't remember where
[2:17:09] I took them
[2:17:13] off. So, if you get them and take them
[2:17:17] home, everybody be happy, even you.
[2:17:21] So, you know, we have so much to thank
[2:17:23] the Lord for the good things that God
[2:17:25] has done. And there will not be a meal
[2:17:28] here. You'll catch that on the way home.
[2:17:30] So, get your things, you know, get it
[2:17:32] together. And um and you know, we so
[2:17:37] appreciate you coming. And I pray with
[2:17:41] all my heart sincerely that our next
[2:17:44] youth camp will be in glory.
[2:17:52] That's going to be an eternal youth
[2:17:55] camp. Won't be no old people there, no
[2:17:58] sick people there. Amen. It'll be one
[2:18:02] glorious day. Amen. Let's stand
[2:18:04] together. Let me just pray with you for
[2:18:07] a moment. There are storms that are
[2:18:09] going off up north of us in Arkansas,
[2:18:11] Missouri. God to be with you as you go
[2:18:14] through those squall line that said is
[2:18:17] has tornadoes and things in it. We need
[2:18:20] God's mercy
[2:18:22] here. We always need God's
[2:18:26] mercy. So let's just talk to him about
[2:18:28] it for a
[2:18:29] moment. Lord, we thank you for all of
[2:18:32] these young people that

[2:18:45] and Lord there'll be joy come as they
