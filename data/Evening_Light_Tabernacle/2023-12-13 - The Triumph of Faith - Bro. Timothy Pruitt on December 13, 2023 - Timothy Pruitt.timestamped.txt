[46:04] turn to Hebrews chap 11 and verse 1 also
[46:07] Matthew chapter 15 and verse
[46:10] 22
[46:12] amen like to speak to you this evening
[46:15] been been been reading a lot on this and
[46:18] and delling on this a lot about faith I
[46:21] believe faith is a wonderful thing to
[46:23] have especially in a faithless
[46:25] generation ation in a faithless world in
[46:28] a world that doesn't even get more and
[46:30] more to be less that believe in God and
[46:33] the things of God and and to be one that
[46:35] is still standing in spite of it all
[46:38] that's a wonderful thing amen Hebrews
[46:40] chap 11 and verse one says now Faith is
[46:43] the substance of things hoped for the
[46:46] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[46:49] the elders obtained a good report
[46:52] through faith we understand that the
[46:55] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[46:57] the things which are seen were not made
[47:00] of things which do not appear also
[47:04] Matthew chap 15 and verse
[47:07] 22 said behold a woman of Canaan came
[47:10] out of the same coast and Cried unto him
[47:13] saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son
[47:15] of David my daughter is grievously vexed
[47:18] with a devil but he answered her not a
[47:21] word and his disciples came and besought
[47:23] him saying send her away for she crith
[47:26] after us but he answered and said I not
[47:29] sent but unto the lost sheep of the
[47:32] House of Israel then came she and got
[47:35] mad and angry and walked away and
[47:38] stomped her feet no she came and and she
[47:41] came and worshiped him can you imagine
[47:44] this he just said I wasn't sent to you
[47:46] but she still came and worshiped him
[47:49] saying Lord help me she must understood
[47:52] that was her only source of help amen
[47:55] but but he answered and said it is not
[47:57] meat to take the L children's bread and
[48:01] to cast it to the dogs and she said well
[48:05] that's the way you feel about it I'm
[48:06] done no she said truth truth Lord yet
[48:10] the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall
[48:13] from their master's table then Jesus
[48:15] answered and said unto her oh woman
[48:18] great is thy faith be it unto thee even
[48:21] as thou Wilt and her daughter was made
[48:24] whole from that very hour amen God bless
[48:28] you you can be
[48:33] seated I I've I've been just going
[48:35] through tons of quotes and I'm still not
[48:37] through just uh reading things where
[48:40] brother Brown spoke about faith I mean
[48:42] that's of course the theme of his entire
[48:44] Ministry was Faith bringing the people
[48:46] to believe am mean that's what he was to
[48:49] do is to bring us back to the faith of
[48:51] the fathers so is no doubt or it's
[48:54] understandable that that would be uh the
[48:56] thread that's all the way through his
[48:58] ministry is Faith is Faith to believe
[49:00] for salvation Faith to believe for
[49:02] Rapture Faith to believe for healing
[49:05] Faith Amen to believe for the things of
[49:07] God and and so I've been looking at
[49:09] these things and I I just want to read
[49:11] this in the um uh in the Amplified
[49:14] version of HEB Hebrews chapter one
[49:16] chapter 11 and verse one in the
[49:18] Amplified I was kind of where it started
[49:20] with me it says now Faith is the
[49:23] Assurance or the title deed or
[49:26] confirmation of things that are hoped
[49:28] for that are divinely
[49:31] guaranteed the evidence of Things Not
[49:34] Seen but it's the conviction of their
[49:37] reality Faith comprehends as fact what
[49:41] cannot be experienced by physical senses
[49:44] for by this kind of Faith the men of old
[49:48] gain Divine approval by faith that is
[49:52] the with an inherent trust and enduring
[49:55] confidence
[49:56] and the power and wisdom and goodness of
[49:58] God we understand that the worlds
[50:01] universes and Ages were framed in
[50:03] created they were formed and put in
[50:05] order and equipped for the intended
[50:07] purpose by the word of God so the things
[50:10] which are seen now are were made were
[50:14] was not made out of things which are
[50:16] visible in other words what we see today
[50:18] with our natural eyes one day there was
[50:21] a DA that you couldn't see them with
[50:23] these natural eyes but they were
[50:24] literally spoken to existence by the
[50:27] word of God and so we know Faith finds
[50:30] sources that thing that our eyes cannot
[50:32] see it finds a place amen that it can
[50:35] hold on to that no matter what our
[50:37] senses declare or does not declare it
[50:40] has an anchor there Faith sees what
[50:42] blind people doesn't see amen and and
[50:45] I'm not talking about blind as far as
[50:48] with your eyes but there are actually
[50:50] blind people we know that actually could
[50:52] see more than people that could see with
[50:54] natural eyes because they had Faith to
[50:57] believe we we know the blind man in the
[50:58] Bible that was was born blind is one of
[51:01] my favorite stories or one of my
[51:02] favorite healings and of Jesus's
[51:05] Ministry was the blind man who who were
[51:07] born blind and and they asked him was he
[51:09] born blind because of he of his sin or
[51:12] or or because of his mother or father
[51:13] sin he said no but that the glory of God
[51:16] might be revealed in him and and we know
[51:19] the story of how Jesus would bend down
[51:21] and take some good dirt and the and the
[51:23] Very elements it would take to make
[51:25] those eyes and and to cre the Creator
[51:28] back doing his creation and his creative
[51:31] work and building eyeballs and placing
[51:33] them there in those sockets and he tells
[51:35] him to go wash and he came back seeing
[51:38] amen you know and and he begins to
[51:39] testify of that and people begin to ask
[51:41] questions and they wonder why and what
[51:44] you know how could this be and and and
[51:46] it comes down to it and all their
[51:47] question he just shakes his head and you
[51:49] said you know this is a marvelous thing
[51:51] that never since before the Earth since
[51:53] the Earth been created has a man man
[51:55] been born blind given his sight but yet
[51:57] you don't know who that is in other
[51:59] words I know who he is because I was
[52:02] once a blind man I once had no eyeballs
[52:05] I once had nothing but empty sockets but
[52:07] God only God could do what that man did
[52:11] amen there ain't nobody else upon this
[52:12] earth that could do what he did there's
[52:14] no uh uh medical intervention there's
[52:17] nothing that could do what creative
[52:20] power can do and so that blind man saw
[52:23] what more more than what men with
[52:24] natural eyesight could see they saw a
[52:27] man that would they would call him a
[52:28] illegitimate child they would call him a
[52:31] a b elub they would call him all kind of
[52:33] names but this man had an experience and
[52:35] a faith that anchored deeper than what
[52:38] he could see with the natural eyes and I
[52:40] I believe that's what we have to be the
[52:42] same kind of people that no matter if we
[52:44] see or if we feel or if we hear that has
[52:47] nothing to do with it our faith is
[52:48] anchored because we have an experience
[52:50] with God and God has showed us who he
[52:53] really is in the time that we're living
[52:54] in amen and we have been placed in this
[52:57] place not because of of who we are what
[52:59] we've done but God has placed Us in this
[53:02] place that we are in for the glory of
[53:04] God he's placed you in the battle that
[53:07] you're in he's placed you in the
[53:08] situation that you're in or the or the
[53:10] trouble or the trial or the sickness or
[53:12] whatever it is it's only for one reason
[53:15] that's for the glory of God that God's
[53:17] glory can be revealed in you if it's a
[53:19] sickness it's so the glory of healing
[53:22] God's healing can be revealed in you
[53:24] amen if it's if it's sin is so the glory
[53:27] of God's salvation can be revealed in
[53:30] you that later on in life you'll begin
[53:32] to realize there's a deeper anchor than
[53:34] what you can see because there'll be a
[53:36] time you don't know long you may not
[53:38] feel God's presence for a while you may
[53:40] not see it you may not see the
[53:42] supernatural or see the the visible
[53:44] manifestations of the supernatural but
[53:46] that has nothing to do with it because
[53:48] your faith is anchored deeper than what
[53:50] your eyesight can declare or what your
[53:53] senses can declare amen there's of faith
[53:55] that rest there on the Eternal Promises
[53:58] of God now these five senses we all need
[54:00] them to operate in this world but these
[54:02] five senses that we were given were
[54:04] given to us for one reason and that was
[54:07] to contact the Earthly world that was
[54:09] the only reason was given it's these
[54:11] five senses was not given to you to
[54:13] contact the supernatural realm Can You
[54:15] Feel the supernatural yes sometimes you
[54:17] can feel the moving of the spirit
[54:19] sometimes you can see it sometimes you
[54:21] can see the spiritual uh cloud or the
[54:24] spiritual fire sometimes God allows
[54:26] those things to happen but that is not
[54:28] what God gave you to Anchor amen he gave
[54:31] you a faith to believe no matter if you
[54:33] don't see it if you don't feel it if you
[54:35] don't understand it no matter what you
[54:38] have an anchor that'll hold there
[54:40] regardless of the storm regardless of
[54:42] the feelings regardless of of this that
[54:44] and the other it does not matter amen
[54:46] there's a there's a faith there's a
[54:48] substance there that goes beyond what
[54:51] you can see goes beyond what you can
[54:53] taste goes beyond what you can smell or
[54:55] here amen goes beyond what is seen by
[54:58] the natural senses of the man amen Faith
[55:00] tells you that it's so no matter what
[55:03] your eyesight
[55:05] declares amen Faith tells you that it's
[55:07] Soul no matter what your body declares
[55:09] or no matter what your feelings declare
[55:12] amen faith can declare to you that
[55:14] you're healed and you still just feel
[55:16] just as sick as you ever felt amen you
[55:18] may look just as sick as you ever ever
[55:20] look but faith will come down upon your
[55:23] heart now we know what faith is faith is
[55:25] the revelation of God's
[55:27] word and I want you to understand it is
[55:30] the Revelation that God's word is God
[55:34] heals God delivers God sets free amen
[55:37] God faith say stands there and Faith
[55:40] doesn't reason it Faith knows where it's
[55:42] at so Faith acts and it holds on and it
[55:45] doesn't move from that it don't matter
[55:48] what says what or what does what it
[55:50] doesn't matter who walks away or who
[55:52] says that it matters not Faith hold
[55:54] holds on anyhow I don't care whatever
[55:57] says this or whoever says that it
[55:59] doesn't move a bit it stays right there
[56:02] well wait wait it don't make any
[56:03] difference amen what is faith faith is
[56:06] something that is revealed to you that
[56:08] is not yet but you believe it will
[56:12] be come on somebody amen it's not yet
[56:15] but you believe it will be so if you
[56:17] believe it will be it's as good as
[56:20] yet amen and you're going to stand there
[56:23] until it's done no matter what comes
[56:25] your way no matter how many doubters

[56:31] symptoms denies it doesn't matter what
[56:33] how many doctors reports Den I it it
[56:36] doesn't matter what anything anything

[56:40] Eternal Word of God and it does not
[56:42] waver it does not matter how many winds
[56:45] come how many waves bash against it
[56:47] it'll stand there no matter how long it
[56:49] takes for the answer to come amen this
[56:52] is what he said in Luke chapter 18 and
[56:54] verse one he said he spake a parable
[56:56] unto them this end that men ought to
[56:58] always pray and to not faint he said
[57:01] saying there was in a city a judge which
[57:04] feared not God neither regarded man and
[57:06] there was a widow in that City and she
[57:08] came unto him saying avenge me of my
[57:11] adversaries and he would not for a while
[57:13] but afterward he said within himself
[57:15] though I fear not God nor regard guard
[57:17] man yet because this Widow troubles me I
[57:20] will avenge her lest by her continual
[57:23] coming she wees me and the Lord said
[57:27] hear what the unjudged just said he
[57:30] shall and shall not God avenge his own
[57:33] elect amen I I'm here to tell Satan he's
[57:37] got a day of Vengeance
[57:39] coming Hallelujah which cried day and
[57:42] night unto him though he bear along with
[57:45] him I tell you I tell you not me I tell
[57:48] you he tells you that he will avenge
[57:51] them speedily nevertheless when the son
[57:53] of man cometh shall he find faith on the
[57:58] earth amen you notice he didn't say will
[58:00] I find righteousness or will I find
[58:02] churches or will I find holy people will
[58:06] I find faith in other words faith will
[58:08] be something of Great Value and very
[58:11] precious and very rare there would be
[58:14] very rare that somebody will be on his
[58:16] hands day and night that somebody will
[58:19] be calling on him and says I'm going to
[58:21] be here no matter what you say if you
[58:23] don't say anything I'm still going to be

[58:37] to it doesn't matter if he answers this
[58:39] service it might be tomorrow it might be
[58:42] the next day but when he comes will he
[58:44] find

[58:50] answer is on the
[58:52] way amen somebody that keep on praying

[1:01:55] the door and the man answered and he
[1:01:56] said oh just keep your old

[1:02:23] how we think what we want or how we want
[1:02:26] it God's going to
[1:02:28] answer he promised that he would and I
[1:02:31] know he
[1:02:36] answers preach that before the god that
[1:02:38] answers listen he brother remember
[1:02:40] talked about he said God always answers
[1:02:42] he said many times an unexpected time
[1:02:44] and an unexpect expected place in an
[1:02:47] unexpected way but when he comes will he
[1:02:50] find
[1:02:53] Faith amen man we look we push that all
[1:02:55] the way till when he returns but I
[1:02:57] believe it's a little deeper than that
[1:02:59] because many times we give up when he's
[1:03:03] coming hey it's happened many times go
[1:03:06] go back and read listen to the tapes
[1:03:08] brother brandom talks about discernment
[1:03:09] he said that one missed it got up and
[1:03:11] left as the answer was on the
[1:03:14] way would have received something if
[1:03:16] they just stayed right there and held
[1:03:19] that
[1:03:20] Faith come on now amen well when when he
[1:03:23] comes to our services will he find
[1:03:26] Faith or will he find our doubts and our

[1:04:02] do with it amen what you get out on out

[1:04:59] that
[1:05:02] Jack Amen you know we we have such a
[1:05:05] weird attitude about things sometimes
[1:05:07] and not realizing our attitude
[1:05:09] determines many times what we're going
[1:05:11] to get CU our attitude is a reflection
[1:05:14] of our
[1:05:15] faith hello somebody it's exactly with
[1:05:18] this sarap phenician woman her attitude
[1:05:20] was a reflection of her
[1:05:23] faith amen she could have had a bad
[1:05:25] attitude very quickly and very really
[1:05:28] with a righteous cause I mean good LS he
[1:05:30] called her a
[1:05:32] dog first he told her I didn't even come
[1:05:34] to you so just leave and she pressed
[1:05:36] through that you know and she got on
[1:05:39] through the song service and she's like
[1:05:41] well I'm just going to you know I'm
[1:05:43] going just Lord I just want to worship
[1:05:46] you he said boy I I I come to the house
[1:05:50] of Israel I didn't come to a bunch of
[1:05:53] dogs
[1:05:55] boy we wouldn't want no Pastor like that
[1:05:57] would
[1:05:58] we I didn't come to
[1:06:02] that she said but yay Lord that's true I
[1:06:05] am a
[1:06:09] dog if we'd realize who we really
[1:06:12] are when we get down to it we
[1:06:17] nothing we are nothing and we we're just
[1:06:20] broken down
[1:06:23] Humanity that undeserving of anything
[1:06:26] that we don't have nothing we we don't
[1:06:28] deserve it for him to come down and meet
[1:06:30] with
[1:06:31] us we don't deserve for him to walk
[1:06:33] among us and and to talk to us and to
[1:06:36] speak to us and and and we don't deserve
[1:06:38] that that he would come and and put some
[1:06:40] on a man's heart and deal with him and
[1:06:42] deal with him and deal with him we don't
[1:06:44] deserve none of that but he does it
[1:06:46] anyhow and he comes down and he speaks
[1:06:48] to us and it's our old attitude that
[1:06:50] blocks him from doing what he wants to
[1:06:53] do come on somebody listen he wants to
[1:06:56] do just as much on a Wednesday night
[1:06:58] that he wants to do in any special
[1:07:02] service amen I don't care he wants to do
[1:07:05] just as much if they ain't but two
[1:07:06] people on these pews then this building
[1:07:08] filled with people has nothing to do
[1:07:11] with it it's the attitude to receive and
[1:07:13] say God I want to have faith when you
[1:07:18] come to receive something from God
[1:07:21] that's why I came that's why I'm here I
[1:07:24] I have a need I I have something in my
[1:07:27] life I have my daughter I have this what
[1:07:29] something going
[1:07:38] on Lord he said pray this right you say
[1:07:41] this while you're knocking just keep
[1:07:43] standing there knock a little while get
[1:07:44] tired go no just keep standing there say
[1:07:47] Lord I'm here and I'm not going to
[1:07:51] leave I'm on your hands now I'm I'm
[1:07:54] going to stay right here you getting
[1:07:55] tired of
[1:07:57] listening hello
[1:07:59] somebody you get tired of listening I'm
[1:08:02] having a great time knocking cuz I know
[1:08:05] you're
[1:08:07] coming Hallelujah I know if I'll keep my
[1:08:10] attitude right and I'll stand there and
[1:08:12] say God I'm still
[1:08:14] here come on now if there was ever a
[1:08:17] time for the Church of the Living God to
[1:08:19] stay knocking for Ron Spencer's healing
[1:08:21] it's right now we ought to be on his
[1:08:25] hands day and night God he still has a
[1:08:28] need he's weak in his body Lord he has
[1:08:31] sickness there and the old cancer is
[1:08:33] still eating him up amen but I know
[1:08:35] you're coming I know you're coming Lord
[1:08:38] because you said you would you promised
[1:08:42] it and I'm you tired of listening I'm
[1:08:44] still here
[1:08:52] knocking
[1:08:54] the difference sometimes
[1:08:56] is if I can say this the right way we
[1:09:00] and and we're all guilty of
[1:09:02] it is the need is not as great unless
[1:09:05] it's our
[1:09:08] need you understand what I'm saying if
[1:09:10] it's your daughter or it's your daddy or
[1:09:13] it's your son then the need is great
[1:09:17] that's why brother brand talked about he
[1:09:19] said if I can say it right how he said
[1:09:21] it he said I always try to put my my
[1:09:23] myself in their
[1:09:26] shoes how would you pray if that was
[1:09:28] your
[1:09:29] daddy how would you pray if that was
[1:09:32] your mama or your or your sibling or how
[1:09:35] would you how would you be asking God
[1:09:37] Amen if this was your
[1:09:41] situation come on somebody amen if it
[1:09:44] was you going through this and it was
[1:09:46] you dealing with this and it was you day
[1:09:49] and night never having having separation
[1:09:51] from it amen many times we have
[1:09:53] separation and therefore when we have
[1:09:55] that we forget about it we go days on in
[1:09:58] before we remember listen there's
[1:09:59] there's things that we need to bring
[1:10:01] back to our remembrance amen Satan's
[1:10:03] always trying to put something else more
[1:10:06] important he tried to put things more
[1:10:08] important than healings and deliverances
[1:10:10] and salvations and prodical coming home
[1:10:12] and and those things that are truly
[1:10:14] really important he wants to put your
[1:10:15] money and your job and this thing that
[1:10:17] temporary stuff that's not
[1:10:20] important but buddy if you get out of
[1:10:22] job you'll pray
[1:10:24] if you get out of money you'll pray if
[1:10:26] you get out of things that natural
[1:10:28] things in your life you'll pray how much
[1:10:30] more the spiritual things of
[1:10:33] God how much more of the things amen
[1:10:36] that really have something to do with
[1:10:38] something amen that goes beyond what we
[1:10:40] see or we taste or we smell or we hear
[1:10:43] how much more the supernatural realm
[1:10:45] should we ought to be moving into that
[1:10:50] place Hallelujah anyhow
[1:10:54] yes but see Satan's always trying to
[1:10:57] disrupt your
[1:10:59] faith to belittle your faith or to
[1:11:02] minimize your faith or to stop your
[1:11:04] faith or to hinder your faith because he
[1:11:07] knows God's going to
[1:11:08] come he has witnessed it too many times
[1:11:12] he has witnessed it over and over where
[1:11:14] he thought he had the God's people bound
[1:11:17] and he thought it was beyond hope he
[1:11:18] thought it was beyond it wasn't it
[1:11:21] wasn't even possible anymore that they
[1:11:22] would be saved they'd been slaves too
[1:11:24] long or they'd been this that whatever
[1:11:26] too long but he knows by amen by history
[1:11:30] that when the people of God begin to
[1:11:31] call on the name of the Lord amen and
[1:11:33] then and the Lord begins to move there
[1:11:35] ain't nothing he's going to be able to
[1:11:36] do about it and he knows that if he if
[1:11:39] he if if you really realize who you are
[1:11:42] and that you're not just a dog or some
[1:11:44] worthless pup or nobody or nothing but
[1:11:47] you're a child of God and you're there
[1:11:49] knocking on the door of your
[1:11:52] daddy
[1:11:54] hello somebody amen we're not just
[1:11:57] knocking on the door of an unjust judge
[1:11:59] that was only a parable we are knocking
[1:12:01] on the door of our
[1:12:04] father amen he not somebody that don't
[1:12:07] care about what we're going through or
[1:12:09] don't know the issues and don't know
[1:12:11] what he knows all about it he's just
[1:12:13] asking somebody to
[1:12:16] call and when he comes he wants
[1:12:21] faith that you're still there knocking
[1:12:28] Faith he said let me finish that quote
[1:12:30] he said I'm having a great time knocking
[1:12:32] cuz I know you're coming that's when
[1:12:34] something happens he has to get you off
[1:12:37] his hands so he comes out to answer you
[1:12:41] Hallelujah faith is not based upon a
[1:12:45] myth it's not well just go do this or do
[1:12:48] that or on the words of some man but
[1:12:50] Faith takes its Eternal resting place
[1:12:53] upon God's word which is the
[1:12:56] Bible so if you if you get all tore up
[1:12:59] in your spirit and you don't know where
[1:13:01] your your faith seems to kind of lost
[1:13:03] its anchor you go back to the Bible what
[1:13:06] does the word say about it by a strip
[1:13:09] some
[1:13:10] healed and you put it right back upon it
[1:13:13] Faith anchor to the word of God puts a
[1:13:15] perseverance in someone to hold on to
[1:13:18] the
[1:13:19] promise it puts a stubbornness about him
[1:13:22] it puts a fight about them amen when
[1:13:24] their faith is not anchored in in what
[1:13:26] some man said or some man's Creed but
[1:13:28] it's anchored in something that has
[1:13:30] never
[1:13:32] failed this word of God has never
[1:13:35] failed come on somebody it is the power
[1:13:38] to heal it has the power to save it has
[1:13:41] the power to set set free it has all the
[1:13:44] power that we have need of is in this
[1:13:46] word and if you'll anchor your faith
[1:13:48] upon the word of God it will not
[1:13:52] fail it will come to pass no matter what
[1:13:55] the symptoms say or what the issues are
[1:13:59] his word said
[1:14:02] this but unbelief it relies on
[1:14:08] reasoning I like this it says right here
[1:14:13] he just he puts it like this unbelief
[1:14:15] relies on reasons present day
[1:14:22] things
[1:14:27] you know why you miss him when he comes
[1:14:29] sometimes CU unbelief come into your
[1:14:34] life maybe something happened on a
[1:14:36] Wednesday and it caused a stir to go a
[1:14:38] certain way and something happened and
[1:14:39] all a sudden you're reasoning all kinds
[1:14:40] of things out and and and you got all
[1:14:43] this big thing built up in your mind and
[1:14:45] before you know it when he comes he
[1:14:47] didn't find Faith he found reasoning he
[1:14:50] found doubt he found unbelief
[1:14:53] he found murmuring he found complaining
[1:14:55] he found all kinds of things but Faith
[1:14:57] he said Faith won't do that Faith looks
[1:15:00] at the word faith places itself upon
[1:15:03] that unmovable Rock God's Eternal Word
[1:15:05] Faith doesn't look at
[1:15:10] reasons Faith doesn't need a reason to
[1:15:14] believe that's deeper than what you
[1:15:16] think it is Faith doesn't need a reason
[1:15:18] to believe faith has the
[1:15:21] word amen there for it's already done
[1:15:24] it's already settled it's already the
[1:15:26] purchase price has already been
[1:15:29] paid you know some people say well I
[1:15:31] just don't know I believe God will heal
[1:15:33] but I don't know if it's his will to
[1:15:34] heal well let me tell you the will of
[1:15:36] God is his
[1:15:37] word so if the word of God is his will
[1:15:40] then the will of God is by his stripes
[1:15:42] you are healed many times people use the
[1:15:45] will of God for a copout because of
[1:15:47] their
[1:15:52] unbelief well but I believe God will but
[1:15:54] I don't know if he I believe God can but
[1:15:56] I don't know if he will well his will is
[1:15:58] his word it's the only place that faith
[1:16:02] can lay on and rest that's the only
[1:16:04] sanctuary of Faith's resting place faith
[1:16:07] comes by hearing hearing the word of God
[1:16:10] so Faith finds the word it's sanctuary
[1:16:12] of rest it moves right up to the top of
[1:16:15] that Eternal Rock Christ Jesus the word
[1:16:17] and lays down on it and
[1:16:21] rests boy I love that
[1:16:24] because we in some unrestful
[1:16:27] days and it ain't going to get any more
[1:16:30] restful it's going to be more unrestful
[1:16:33] it's like I told said back in 2020
[1:16:35] people kept saying man I'll be glad when
[1:16:37] this year is over I'm like how you know
[1:16:38] next year is going to be any better and
[1:16:41] it ain't got any better it's got worse
[1:16:44] and it's getting worse and it's getting
[1:16:46] darker and it's getting darker all the
[1:16:48] time amen that's why you have to have
[1:16:51] faith faith is that anchor on the ship
[1:16:54] amen is down there beded down there
[1:16:57] attached to that Bedrock down there
[1:16:59] beneath it and you can't see it you
[1:17:01] can't you don't know it's there you
[1:17:03] don't know what is but you know
[1:17:04] something's hooked and a ship amen is is
[1:17:07] out there in the ocean but it sets down
[1:17:08] that anchor and it gets a real hold and
[1:17:11] storms begin to come and begin to blow
[1:17:13] against it and it just keeps moving back
[1:17:15] and forth and back and forth but it that
[1:17:18] ship can only go so far cuz that faith
[1:17:21] has anchored that ship yes amen and
[1:17:23] that's exactly what's with the believer
[1:17:25] amen storms can come against this church
[1:17:28] it can come against your family it can
[1:17:30] come against all kinds of things it can
[1:17:32] blow it can howl it can burn at whatever
[1:17:34] he wants to do but if your faith is
[1:17:36] anchored in the
[1:17:38] word you will crest every wave you will
[1:17:42] rise right above it you will go right
[1:17:44] over it he said let the winds how let
[1:17:47] the storm Shake She is safe
[1:17:52] Evermore
[1:17:54] Hallelujah she rests right there on that
[1:17:57] word that's where Faith genuine
[1:18:00] Christian faith rest is on the word amen
[1:18:04] for it knows God will prove himself
[1:18:06] Superior over every one of his
[1:18:12] enemies I that's shouting ground right
[1:18:16] there how many's faced an enemy this
[1:18:20] week amen God will prove himself
[1:18:24] Superior over every one of his
[1:18:30] enemies just hold on God's going to
[1:18:33] prove he's Superior over that God's
[1:18:36] going to prove he's in his hands God's
[1:18:38] going to prove he's got the ability to
[1:18:40] pull it off and cast it off at any
[1:18:43] moment at any time sickness can
[1:18:48] flee I believe sickness can flee and I
[1:18:51] believe it does at the preaching of the
[1:18:53] word cuz Faith comes by hearing amen I
[1:18:55] was preaching a sermon one time at
[1:18:56] brother Josh Bennett and there was a man
[1:18:58] that was sitting on the second row and
[1:19:00] he had his feet his feet were so swollen
[1:19:02] and he couldn't even tie his tennis
[1:19:04] shoes and barely could walk into church
[1:19:06] and it was all swollen his leg was
[1:19:07] swollen and at the preaching of the word
[1:19:10] he testified he said all of a sudden he
[1:19:12] realized something was different and he
[1:19:14] be to he be to worship and praise the
[1:19:16] Lord at a certain point he said I begin
[1:19:18] to realize something's different and I
[1:19:20] looked down and my feet had become
[1:19:23] normal
[1:19:24] again all the swelling was gone he said
[1:19:27] I just reached down and I tied my tennis
[1:19:30] shoes hallelujah amen what happened
[1:19:33] Faith came by hearing and Faith was
[1:19:36] there and when Faith had found an anchor
[1:19:38] place when that Spirit come by it finish
[1:19:41] the
[1:19:43] work Hallelujah that's where you want to
[1:19:45] be found with
[1:19:47] faith every
[1:19:49] service Faith to believe this is my
[1:20:01] moment what kind of service would we
[1:20:03] have right
[1:20:04] now if every question or every every
[1:20:08] need was answered right
[1:20:15] now well I believe we can have those
[1:20:17] type of
[1:20:18] services I know they did in the prophets
[1:20:21] day I know he said many times he said
[1:20:23] look at that everyone in the whole
[1:20:24] building was
[1:20:27] healed what happened Faith got in the
[1:20:30] building they for you know what they
[1:20:32] begin to forget about tomorrow and
[1:20:34] everything else they didn't care Faith
[1:20:37] was in the building they saw something
[1:20:38] real or reality and they saw the their
[1:20:41] faith begin to grow and he said look
[1:20:43] it's just almost milky in here because
[1:20:45] of of the faith that's in the building
[1:20:47] and he said what's happening people are
[1:20:49] beginning to believe that they can have
[1:20:51] their need answered
[1:20:53] they're beginning to believe that this
[1:20:55] is their
[1:20:56] service oh so there's some keys there if
[1:20:58] you want to have that kind of service
[1:21:00] that everyone's needs can be answered
[1:21:02] with we got to start believing that way
[1:21:04] we got to start believing that he's a

[1:30:26] she knew is her position had nothing to
[1:30:28] do with her it was of God's
[1:30:31] choosing God placed her there and God
[1:30:33] put her there and God made her my
[1:30:35] daughter and she knew beyond that door
[1:30:38] that voice was not the voice of some
[1:30:40] stranger that voice was not the voice of
[1:30:42] somebody she barely knew that voice was
[1:30:44] the voice of her
[1:30:45] father and she knew he she knew his
[1:30:49] nature she knew he was just joking with
[1:30:50] her and he was just playing with her so
[1:30:52] she stands there knowing her
[1:30:55] position I'm not saying God's joking
[1:30:57] with you tonight but I'm saying you need
[1:30:59] to stand there at the door knowing who
[1:31:02] you are and you know who you are
[1:31:04] therefore you know who he is I'm a son
[1:31:07] I'm a daughter therefore that's my
[1:31:09] father in there and he's going to
[1:31:12] answer it might not be tonight but it
[1:31:14] doesn't matter I'll be here
[1:31:16] tomorrow it doesn't matter if it's
[1:31:18] tomorrow it don't matter if it's 25
[1:31:20] years I'm going to be there cuz I know
[1:31:23] he will answer his word cuz he promised
[1:31:27] his word will not return into him void
[1:31:30] but it will accomplish that which is
[1:31:33] sent to
[1:31:34] do you're not going in there to some
[1:31:38] stranger but if we have a high priest
[1:31:42] who has come down and became one of
[1:31:44] us and he knows what it's like to Bear
[1:31:47] the things that we bear he said to you
[1:31:49] sick people I'd like to drive this home
[1:31:52] when you catch that faith that you're
[1:31:53] going to be healed every circumstance
[1:31:56] everything else all signs all symptoms
[1:31:58] can point you're dying you won't move
[1:32:00] from
[1:32:00] that it's a resting place in the
[1:32:04] sanctuary of God's word When Faith
[1:32:06] genuine genuine Faith sits there not
[1:32:09] make believe now but Faith Hope out
[1:32:11] there hoping was hoping it Hop's out
[1:32:13] there hoping it was in faith is already
[1:32:15] in looking at it saying it's
[1:32:18] done it's done that's Faith that's where
[1:32:22] Faith takes his rest in place for it
[1:32:24] knows God will never let the enemy R
[1:32:27] over the top of
[1:32:30] him he never has Faith knows that so
[1:32:33] regardless of what it looks like Noah
[1:32:35] knew that the ark would
[1:32:37] float why because it was thus sayith the
[1:32:40] Lord it wasn't some manufactured
[1:32:43] something Noah decided to dream up on
[1:32:45] his own and say you know what boys I got
[1:32:48] a good idea today we're going to build
[1:32:50] an ark what for it's going to rain what

[1:33:17] and healings and deliverances and things
[1:33:19] take place every service on a Wednesday
[1:33:21] on a Sunday
[1:33:23] yeah not because I said so it's because
[1:33:26] he said
[1:33:27] so amen so I rest upon that Daniel knew
[1:33:31] that God was going to close the lion's
[1:33:36] mouth
[1:33:38] hallelujah hallelujah the Hebrew
[1:33:40] children knew that God would stop the
[1:33:43] fire Jesus knew that God would raise him
[1:33:46] up
[1:33:47] again cuz the word said I'll leave his
[1:33:50] soul and I'll leave not leave is soul in
[1:33:52] Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One
[1:33:53] to see corruption he knew corruption
[1:33:55] said in about 72 hours and he said
[1:33:57] within 3 days I'll raise it up again it
[1:34:00] took its Eternal resting place in the
[1:34:03] sanctuary of God's
[1:34:07] word you need rest tonight go to the
[1:34:12] word not Fox News not Google listen you
[1:34:15] get a symptom and go to Google you ain't
[1:34:17] going to find no
[1:34:19] rest you read the doctor's report most
[1:34:22] of the time you're not going to find no
[1:34:24] rest but you read God's
[1:34:27] report and you
[1:34:33] go stretch out a little bit kind of take
[1:34:36] in these coverage right quick get all
[1:34:39] comfortable because I know he said
[1:34:43] it and if he said it I believe it it
[1:34:48] doesn't matter what comes my way it
[1:34:50] doesn't matter matter what happens it
[1:34:53] circumstances does not mean
[1:34:57] anything circumstances does not define
[1:35:00] who you
[1:35:01] are neither does it Define who God
[1:35:04] is God is on the throne God is God and
[1:35:08] His word is still the truth and I have
[1:35:11] faith to believe it therefore I
[1:35:13] rest let's Stand
[1:35:20] Together
[1:35:24] where's your
[1:35:26] faith do you only have faith when the
[1:35:29] preaching is how you want it he said
[1:35:32] things just as
[1:35:33] perfectly nothing hurt my feelings I got
[1:35:37] faith no he's looking sometimes to see
[1:35:39] if you got faith when stuff does hurt
[1:35:41] your
[1:35:42] feelings I got a scripture for
[1:35:45] it he's got faith whether the service
[1:35:48] went the exact he wants he wants to know
[1:35:50] if there's Faith whether the service
[1:35:51] goes how you thought it was going to go
[1:35:52] or how this one thought it doesn't
[1:35:55] matter when he
[1:35:57] comes will he find
[1:36:00] Faith don't quit quit putting that off
[1:36:03] when he comes it's when he
[1:36:06] comes when he comes in our midst will he
[1:36:09] find a little woman that Reach Out And
[1:36:10] Touch the him of His
[1:36:12] Garment will he find somebody that's
[1:36:14] there still putting a nail in the rock
[1:36:16] or in the ark will he say find somebody
[1:36:20] there still holding a rod and speaking
[1:36:21] to the
[1:36:22] waters will he find somebody is still
[1:36:25] there defying That Old King that said
[1:36:27] I'm going to burn you well do what you
[1:36:28] want to O King but as for me and my
[1:36:31] house I'm going to serve
[1:36:34] God will he find faith will he find
[1:36:38] somebody that believes no matter how
[1:36:41] many goes by the way of the Grave that
[1:36:43] has nothing to do with
[1:36:47] it I think sometimes we get the wrong
[1:36:50] impression because somebody died that
[1:36:52] they didn't have faith some people say
[1:36:54] they're anti- bunch of
[1:36:57] nonsense
[1:36:59] but that's the greatest
[1:37:02] healing that could ever happen to
[1:37:06] somebody and just because they went by
[1:37:08] by the grave does not mean that they
[1:37:11] didn't have faith brother Tim said it at
[1:37:13] that funeral sister Erica her faith took
[1:37:16] her
[1:37:20] there
[1:37:22] it's been said by our pastor before and
[1:37:24] I've used it many times because it's
[1:37:26] gave me great comfort when Jesus
[1:37:27] standing at the grave of Lazarus and he
[1:37:29] wept he wasn't weeping because of
[1:37:32] unbelief or this that and the other he
[1:37:33] done faced all kinds of
[1:37:35] unbelief but he knew he was going to
[1:37:37] bring that man back from a place of
[1:37:40] perfect
[1:37:41] health a place to never have another
[1:37:44] mind battle to never have another sin
[1:37:47] another doubt another unbelief and he's
[1:37:49] going to bring him back to live this old
[1:37:51] wretched life all over
[1:37:54] again there ain't a one of them that
[1:37:56] wants to come back here but how many of
[1:37:59] us wants to go
[1:38:02] there will he find
[1:38:06] Faith let's bow our
[1:38:12] hands Lord just been dealing with my
[1:38:15] heart
[1:38:16] father even about my own
[1:38:18] faith my own thoughts and thinking
[1:38:23] Lord you know when we go through
[1:38:25] things old ugly serpent the Old Devil
[1:38:28] tries to come and attach himself to our
[1:38:31] hurts and
[1:38:34] scars wants to put depression there
[1:38:37] anxiety and he wants to come in the M
[1:38:39] night the night time and deal with us in
[1:38:41] our
[1:38:43] subconscious wants to torment us every
[1:38:46] way he
[1:38:47] can but Lord we don't yield to him we
[1:38:51] don't yield to what he says we don't
[1:38:53] yield to his
[1:38:55] nonsense we rest upon your
[1:38:59] word Lord you promised me you promised
[1:39:02] me you would be in the
[1:39:05] fire and I know you are still God of
[1:39:07] your
[1:39:09] promise and I know Lord no matter what
[1:39:11] we go through in the situations of life
[1:39:14] you showed us very clearly you're here
[1:39:16] with
[1:39:17] us Lord Jesus let our faith just rise to
[1:39:20] such a level
[1:39:22] yes Lord there may be naysayers that
[1:39:25] wants to say all kinds of things against
[1:39:26] us may want to accuse us false accus
[1:39:30] us say all kinds of things but it
[1:39:33] matters not what they
[1:39:35] say it matters not their opinion it
[1:39:38] matters not what they feel it matters
[1:39:40] not anything what they do it only
[1:39:43] matters what the master
[1:39:45] says Lord we like that little boy as
[1:39:48] we're playing that violin and we get
[1:39:49] through with it Lord tonight
