that you'll just reveal yourself through the word Lord that you will just minister to us in a great way today as we look into the things of God as we open up the pages of the Bible and we look into the depths of the word I pray o God that we'll take it then digest it and become one with it that Lord oh God it'll be something that's upon our lips from our hearts and we'll put into action in our lives bring healing and deliverance to your children today those that are sick and needy those that are listening to the end Lord that we're reaching out around the world that will be hearing this

lover of our soul we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord today and be in his presence and I just want to say we love the Lord today and thankful for each one of you that are here with us and last night I had a little special treat I spoke to the Church of the Rising Sun in Japan in their morning service it was last night for me but morning for them and their lovely group and I wonder if we have that picture there that they have now rented a place that they have us that is set aside for worship and we continue to support the work in Japan and and some of the translation works that has went on there for some time and I think we got like 300 we went from zero to 347 sermons of brother branham's in the in the language of Japan so that the message can go to them and and can deal with hearts and lives we thank the Lord for that amen so we are we appreciate um those that have went and uh carried the word and the burden of the word and helped out in that in that and see that we have a part invested in this an extension of us even in light Tabernacle that are there on the other side of the globe and they are they're um doing everything they can to get in step with the gospel of Christ and brother um brother fedemar uh he's a Filipino from the Philippines but he resides there in Japan and he has taken on the Pastoral ship there and as you can see it's kind of a multinational group I think they have Portuguese and African and as well as Japanese and Chinese and so but you know that's the way it is God has um no barriers as far as One race there's one race and that's the god race amen and that's what we want to face upon is um the god race that's what we focus on now the Bible said for these truths that we have to to commit them to Faithful Men And The Gospel that God has given us God has uh also raised up Faithful Men that surround the ministry that help us and I don't know if you noticed it or not but some of you that sit in the mezzanine on that front row seat there you know it was really Jam close and and we had already tried to do something to make it comfortable but I want to thank brother Jim Morgan for his skills and expertise and reworking that for more a foot and leg room it just turned out so beautiful I'm so proud of it thank you brother Jimbo God bless you also the Baxters and the Mitchells have made some beautiful trolleys to store and transport to chairs in the fellowship hall and uh they're just beautiful with the most awesome craftsmanship and to know we got welders like brother Mark brother Jonathan Mitchell and and uh and these these families are just always giving and what a blessing they are to the body of Christ so I want to say thank you from the depths of my heart not only that but every one of you that do a part here whether you're an unseen person up in the mezzanine and on our I mean and the the audio Booth or the video Booth you know without you well we couldn't there's a lot we could not do and so we want to thank you and there's no one there's no one great among us but the Lord Jesus amen and so we love him with all our hearts so will you turn with me to Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 9 for our scripture reading this morning and and praying that God will bless you in a mighty way today and that he will anoint his word to us I see there's some of you back back from different trips and things that where you've been and I pray that you came back refreshed from the the meetings that you were in or wherever you have been so may you just come and bring your lick of fire and put it together with ours this morning and let's press home for the kingdom of God Amen Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 9 and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly returning to thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in AIDS and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women so the Bible does acknowledge circumstances amen these were the these were the circumstances that Sarah and Abraham were old and well-stricken in age I can imagine that I'm not quite that old but I can imagine how that would be you know and it ceased to be with Sarah after the man or women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord be an old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I have a surge he bear a child which among is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son listen this is not going to be your ability this is going to be me doing this and then Sarah denied Sam I laugh Notch for she was afraid but and he said nay but thou did his life may God bless you as you're seated I am going to speak this morning maybe it's a little odd text but I'm going to speak on Sarah watch your tongue you see Sarah within her heart or with inner self um she was thinking things that was out of step with what God's word had said God had just said something very clearly and precisely and here in the very face of God she doubts and she not only just doubt but within herself she actually laughs and that word is scoffs she actually mocks our laughs you know within ourselves he doesn't do it in a show it's just something that is uh that she's with inner self that she is thinking and she mockingly laughs you know and and thinking just how ridiculous can this be you know how how impossible in Earth and these thoughts get called out by God because brother Branham tells us that the angel of God told him to let us know that our thoughts are louder in heaven than our words are on the Earth so you want to really keep your your words uh pure but you also want to keep your thinking right you see thinking right is your duty to God and then doing right is your duty yourself and then after that you know you'll come out right so but Sarah in her heart is um is scoffing and she's doubting in the face of God and and then not only that but you know see basically uh when does she's confronted with the word saying but oh yeah this is your problem this is what you're doing she denies it in the face of God and basically calls God a liar and and I want you to understand God is Holy and he cannot stand sin and unbelief is the root of sin and and so again um as brother Branham refers to this and I'm gonna read about three quotes from that word that he refers to this very situation and he says the church is going to be there without spot a wrinkle in other words not one sin or one doubt no unbelief see and he says the grace of God will do that now if you notice this in this very thing the grace of God overrode Sarah's unbelief amen it overrode her even lying in the face of God and basically call him a liar that his word wasn't true right Grace over wrote it I want you to understand not only are we needing rapturing faith we need Rapture and Grace amen because of our own inabilities to believe our own human weaknesses to to lift ourselves up into the promise of God so he said it'll take Grace like he talks to Abraham when Sarah doubt him well then he would have slain Sarah right there for doubting because that's the worst sin there is is unbelief and the only sin so brother Branham explains to us that those others are attributes of sin smoking drinking lion cussing everything else he said is not sin that's the attributes of sin there's only one sin and that's unbelief and you and I are even though we are the redeemed children of God that we still need the blood and we still need the grace of God Amanda to keep us from sin and keep us from sinning and producing the attributes of sin but here again we every one of us are sinned by disbelieving the word of God by by not reaching and grabbing and claiming it as our as our own by doubting what God Said now I want to I want to deal with this a little bit because you're not alone with with the dealing with doubts and unbelief you're not by yourself the greatest prophets there has been great men of God to the ages this great woman of God doubt it disbelieved questioned wondered pondered that's human and I want you to understand you're going to be a human still for a long time until your body's changed and as long as you're in this body you're going to be fighting against imaginations against strongholds of the enemy against doubt against fear against unbelief of all kinds and you are going to have to constantly battle against it you're going to have to watch out and keep changing your thinking taking those thoughts captive bringing them subject to the word of God now she doubted she left within herself and when the angel discerned her through the tent is that right but why couldn't he take Sarah because she was part of Abraham she he went out to take Abraham too and we're a part of Jesus we're in the body of Christ our unbeliefs are excused if we do it ignorantly like she did for she was scared now notice what he said he said we are in Jesus we are in the body of Christ and that's why that sin or or say judgment should not strike us or will not strike us is because we're in Christ amen we're part of the promise we're part of a Redemption plan and God cannot abandon his Plan of Redemption hallelujah amen he cannot predestinate you and you are predestinated to Rapture come on you are predestinated to sit with him on his throne you are called of God to be an overcomer and God is predestinated you to that I want you to understand your destiny has been set and there's nothing in between here and there that is going to keep you from fulfilling your destiny Hallelujah because even in our weaknesses Grace is going to override it you are highly favored of the Lord and I want you to see yourself as highly favored called blessed chosen ordained consecrated dedicated sons of God Daughters of God that's who you are I don't care what the devil has been telling you I don't even care what you're all thinking is thinking amen I'm weak I'm not able I can't do it I have this inability look at my circumstances look at it it's impossible you've got to come back and look at this Grace over Brides your impossibilities [Applause] brother Branham said our sins would ruin us we're talking about Christians amen we're talking about Christians our sins would ruin us if we wasn't part of Christ he can't strike the church because we are Christ see Sarah and Abraham were one in Christ and his church is one our sins are covered by his blood by his faith not ours we're trusting in his finished work remember what he says to Sarah I'm going to do this I will return and I will give you a son this is not your abilities remember the only thing that should that gave her strength was when she does him faithful not that I can do this not that I'm the one able but my God is able [Applause] if not for Grace where would we be and we need it for rapture I need Grace he said let me give you a little Grace here brethren I need a little Grace amen that minute God would have killed Sarah for disbelief in that angel remember unbelief is sin and you approach and stand in the front of God remember with sin there will repel you or put you from his presence and he said God would have killed Sarah for disbelieving that angel he didn't look at that angel went down and told Lot's wife not to look back and see what happened to her for her unbelief see but he couldn't take Sarah because she was part of Abraham amen and today I believe the unbelief with the real true church true church she has unbelief but he can't touch her we're in Jesus you can't take the church without hurting Christ he couldn't take Sarah without hurting Abraham so Grace covered it now you know it's one thing about God he can't change his mind if he sent Jonah down down to Nineveh he couldn't he couldn't raise up Moses or get Elijah or hit somebody else he ordained children to do this job amen amen if God's ordained you to uh this day and this hour he can't call up somebody else ain't nobody can take your place amen you cannot be replaced God had thoughts of you before the world began and he cannot replace you with somebody else because that you are a failure in fact of the matter is Grace has got to take and change your life from failure to power God could not change his mind he had already told Abraham Sarah's going to have a child he'd already chosen Sarah nothing else could be done so therefore God has to go to work God has to give Grace God has to give forgiveness God has to give pardoned so you see see um God has said he will have a bride without spot or wrinkle and she will be a woman of faith amen you're called by Prophet that little faith woman and God of this evil age when he's talking about the evil age he talks about you then he said that little faith woman amen see you are you are people of faith now he will have a bride without spot a wrinkle and when he comes he says I'm looking for faith when I come back I'm looking for faith what do you think God's not going to get what he expects if God expects something don't you know it's going to come to pass so if he said I'm expecting faith when I come back then he's going to have faith somewhere and if you don't find Faith then he's got to bring the faith Hallelujah if you're locking this morning then the only one you can't add a foot to your statue you can't do nothing on your own that God will have to add it to you and all you've got to do is just yield yourself to God and say God I'm Yours they can change my life now God gets what he expects now there's so many times like Sarah we're still faithless she's still looking at herself instead of God of whom there is nothing too hard for looking at her circumstances this finally this last quote on that subject from birth pains why did Sarah laugh concerning this baby and circumference and said she didn't but you did and he would have killed her right there if she wasn't a part of Abraham so would God slay us if we wasn't a part of Christ but the mercies of Christ holds us all together us doubters and perversions in the word amen so you got to realize if you wasn't a part of his thoughts if he wasn't a part of his plan his word you see it might be different but God has to fulfill his word amen God cannot go back on his word so instead of killing you or just abandoning his plan God has to get us on board he's got to get you to believe him so he would send signs and wonders and miraculous send a message to Guinness believer to start changing our thinking and what I want you to do today is start changing your thinking about yourself about who you are as a Son of God or a daughter of God you're not some downtrodded something [Applause] your sons and daughters are the most high God you're the Queen of Heaven you're a princess amen now you see it and to do that we must change we must have the right attitude toward the promise and our thinking has to be corrected and our hearts have to be turned but and it's so important about what we think and what we say Proverbs 18 21 says death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruits so death and life is in the power of your tongue and and you you will eat the fruit of what you say are you with me amen you you if you're prone to negativity you're going to eat its fruits your tongue has the power to bring death or life and and if your confession will line up with God's word instead of your problems then you will eat the fruit of life and the blessings that comes from the word but as long as you're thinking you know well it'll never happen for me I can never be blessed you know into everything bad always happens to me I can't I can't ever be prosperous I I can't ever walk in Victory as long as you're thinking that you're going to eat the fruit of that but you've got to have the mindset amen that I can do all things through Christ that empowers me you got to cast down your imaginations you gotta cause and anything anything any hot thought that exalts itself against the word of God and here Sarah have thoughts that it exalted itself her problem her age her inability and she exalted that over what God Said the Bible said in Proverbs 6 24 gracious words are like honeycomb sweetness to the soul and health to the body so you see saying the right thing having the right attitude about the word is of vital importance and it can't be over emphasized you want to be very careful even in your relationships well in your home with your with the husband and wife you want to be very careful about what what your words are because again it can bring either sickness or it can bring Health to a marriage if you're always down and always fussing and always a bickering about this or you know pointing out at the thoughts are pointing out you know the the limitations are you know I always down in the mouths about you will cause a health bad Health to your home to your marriage to your children and not only that you will pass that on to another generation you know some people are like oh Eeyore you know ain't nothing ever going to happen to me ain't nothing good ever happens for me oh I can ever get the blessings of God you know everybody's down on me and oh well me and they go through life for the whole mentality and then you pass that on your kids they learn to be negative just like you you want to watch what you say amen what's your tongue because gracious words are like honeycomb they they are their sweetness to the soul and help to the body it'll energize you have you ever had somebody say something nice about you something good about you and it just energizes you you know it it just makes you want to even be better that's where you all need to do with your children tell them how good they are how wonderful they are you know how proud you are of them amen tell your daughter she's beautiful she needs to hear it from her daddy you're beautiful you are loved you're special you're God's daughter you're chosen you're blessed your sons need to hear it [Applause] are you gonna be turned out like a failure don't tell your kid that tell them you're going to rise up above any problem any crisis any situation you're going to defeat every enemy you have been born to be victorious it's Health to the body it's healthy the marriage a lot of marriages are ruined by negative comments can come from the husband or the wife a lot of children are warped it can never be good enough they're always hadn't overcome some something you know from that was put on them a cloud of doubter unbelief don't do that speak Faith to your children speak Faith to yourself speak Faith to your spouse amen amen oh yeah I'm not saying ignore circumstances yeah things are tight but he said he'll bless me yeah yeah you know I mean I got this deal today you know warn your people uh you know that somebody was you know I guess in good faces trying to say better warn your people that the economy is going to collapse and it's all going into failure well what good can you do about it my Jesus said don't even worry about tomorrow he said you got enough evil for today why why worry about tomorrow don't even think about it there ain't nothing you can do to change it anyway come on so what can you do you can walk in Grace let me tell you if you stay in the promised land of faith in God's word God will even bless you during family when the economy is bad when banks are falling everywhere gotta make you to prosper brother John it is the word amen he told Isaac remain in this land he was tempted to go down to Egypt because of the famine remain in this land and he planted during a drought and God blessed a hundredfold when everybody else had crop failures Hallelujah people had blessings because they stayed in the land of faith and believing now even redeemed Sons I mean great men of God even I'll use brother Branham for example I'm going to use him a little bit here and when he's thinking of Mark 11 22 and and he's thinking about it he has to have his thinking corrected he has the wrong thoughts you see because any of us can have the wrong thoughts thus the wrong attitude toward the scripture and he was looking at Mark 11 22 and 3 and saying you know well that's was that was before the atonement so you know it really doesn't apply to us because it would have to come through the atonement and Jesus said that before the atonement and things like that and God had to correct his thinking to show him that the lips of a man can be anointed to say the right things remember how do you write amen you remember even when the fish was giving back his life you we've heard the story of most of you young people I guess would know I hope you have read the uh the supernatural books because they should they're they're available for for all of our young people to know of what God did in this generation but you know in their brother Branham was out fishing they ran out of bait and so they were trying to catch some little little fish forbaden and so Lyle well Woods one of one of the Banks's brother was was fishing with him in the Bowden he used too big of a hook and and it swallowed the the hook and he just jumped it out right this entrance right out through his mouth and flicked it out into the water and said oh a little fishy you you've shot your last wad but you know and and um brother Branham is standing or there he's already had a vision or a word from God saying you're going to see the resurrection of a small animal and so he already has this word but he don't know where it's going to be he thought maybe a little Joseph had squeezed the cat and a little kitten there and dropped it and and it died and he thought maybe that was it but it wasn't you see I want you to get something even prophets probe wonder how is this going to happen where does this fit in when is this going to take place and so he said I later he would say I would have said none well no more spoke to that fish than nothing if something hadn't spoke to him to me first but he said what was it he spoke that secondarily now the brother random teaches us and I'm probably going to do a sermon on this about the written word and defeating the Devil with the written word but God gives us first the written word but secondarily he gives his prophets and with that prophets he gives visions and also secondarily way of God speaking is through Apostles prophets teachers of answers and pastors actually this morning as I preach and if I under the inspiration I am prophesying amen I'm speaking forth the word of God the Bible calls it Oracles of God or God used in a man to speak through his lips putting something on his heart to deal with yours amen so you see he spoke those secondarily by the Holy Spirit through the human lips and become the creative power of almighty God because God said so and it taken that way how much more could he through if taken that way how much more could he do the written word of the Lord God that was spoken through human lift as it was so it Falcon believe how simple just don't doubt it so he said if you take the word take just the Bible scripture just what is written in the word of God amen that it's actually greater than a secondary way a prophecy or a vision or a prophet speaking amen because it is first God's primary way of speaking you through your Bible that's why you ought to get in love with your Bible and read it and and take it for yourself God's speaking to you now so now that's why why we think on these things we meditate on the word of God let the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh God now Psalms 19 verse 14 let the word of my mouth I want to read it to you and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in my sight O Lord my strength and my redeemer are you with me amen so again let the words of my mouth the meditation what I think on be acceptable because you're going to know my thoughts are louder in heaven that my words are on Earth so you know you're sitting there you're thinking all these dark thoughts and unbelief what's going through the halls of Heaven that's why you need a shield of blood but that's also why you need to stop for a moment and quit thinking those kind of thoughts amen but think on things that are acceptable in his sight oh Lord my strength and my redeemer so be careful what you think about maybe you guard your tongue but you're sinning with your thoughts maybe you had don't even say it but this is what you're dwelling on or what you're thinking about what you're meditating on now let's talk about what we have been prophesied to be we have been prophesied to be a super Church it's a much that all the Bible prophecies will be fulfilled in us that speaks of the bride and you must think of yourself as a super Church come on now to be a super Church you gotta think of yourself as a super Church he called us bride he said we are blessed he calls us sons and daughters it is he the Bible said it is he that has made us and not we ourselves a lot of people say well don't call yourself the brides you know you keep saying bride bride bride you know you're trying to make yourself some I'm not making myself nothing he made me he put the engagement ring on my finger before the foundation of the world he chose me before I turned back and chose him [Music] come on he loved me first when I was still unlovable by the way and he gave himself for me so brother Bradham talks about the super race he says now this is what I'm trying to say unto you the law of reproduction brings forth of his kind now if God planted word in this day through a prophet how many beliefs he did then of course then the law of reproduction says then there's got to be a word bride that comes forth so these last days the true church Bride Comes The Headstone he said will be a super Church a super race as it nears the great headstone there will be they will be so much like him until they will be in his very image in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestations of the word of the Living God that means they will be more than theology but they will actually be the word in action listen brother Branham the blood of Jesus so thoroughly cleanse us that there's no trace of sin I'm talking to the sinless virtuous bride of Christ even though you know you know you were doubting and you know you've been thinking wrong and you know you've been scoffing and saying I mean no not me never I I can't never do it I'm too little I'm unable I'm not equipped I'm not good enough I've got a past you see you see but the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from all sins and the complete word of God rests within you that the command of their own voice is creative power because in them is the Holy Ghost think about that the words that you speak have creative power amen and the and this this Holy Ghost is a Creator and he makes things come to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken becomes God in action so there again when you start speaking the word it puts God into action so the third poll we know is the opening of the word we talk about it sometimes we know there was the speaking of the squirrels the healing of of um meet of Branham and the the um the common of the storm all the other things that went along with it how do you write and the salvation of her two boys but so that all of that shows the power that lays within the word amen and so it is the opening of the word it is the revealing of the Mysteries but it's not just restored truth and revealing Mysteries but there is a super anointing that comes with it now I want to get with the word stay with me now with the word that we have received comes a super anointing with the third pull came a super anointing now but of course we're human we're still here in these bodies we still think a lot like humans and we don't always think God thoughts and we doubt and we flushed her we get agitated and worry and fear now and not only that we have some more problems we have changed the message into lecturing and sorry to say but that's what too many Pizza many message preachers have done that have left the word of preaching the power and they're just I'm just going to say it this way unsophisticated lectures mix and psychology with the message now I call them unsophisticated because must have never went to school most of them aren't theologians so they're not sophisticated I'm not a sophisticated preacher either I was called of God I would sing Bible School Jesus did and all the prophets somebody help me preach I didn't go to it like Paul did who studied under chameleon had to forget all he knew that he might learn Christ now but it but let me just say let me just say this to to these message preachers preaching Psychology today if you're going to teach psychology then at least go to college for it you know these ignorant preachers who want to read a book and then try to implement implement it changing by changing Behavior patterns of people that's what somebody reading a book on doing surgery and going to move my remove my gallbladder or do a heart bypass and think they can implement it you know brother Jonathan wants to be a doctor that's his goal and his ambition but I don't want him moving my gallbladder yet he might be very smart and very studied and he might have read a few books on biology and how to do it but he ain't experimenting on me and I don't want no preacher using his book rat theology or psychology on me and trying to reform my nature amen but I want somebody who's experiencing the Holy Ghost who has met God that can lead me to Christ and have a baptism of the holy spirit that changes lives that's what I want so if you're going to teach a new birth I say experience it first so you know what you're talking about amen I can't help you with psychology I know nothing about it but I can help you with a new birth because I've experienced it amen not only that I've had many successful operations amen this room is full of many successful operations and three kinds of Believers brother Brandon said then there are those with the talents that is the great organizers worldly wisdom they preach the gospel claim to smart man intellectual listen a man that's trained in that field he's not a preacher he's a lecturer and that's the problem today we have lectures Jesus said never said go and train and do this he said go and preach the gospel and these signs shall follow the preaching see that's not learned to make a lecture who can stand and just my put them uh flowery things in and make you feel like you're sitting in the presence of an archangel that isn't it Heaven forms of godliness you see that's a lecture not the Holy Spirit In Action some little fellow that wouldn't know his ABCs might come down with the power of Faith with the word and make the Holy Spirit do things that that man knows nothing about and deny it see there you are then he goes on and tells us and today the church ought to be Jesus Christ in action upon the Earth because I live you shall live also my life in you the works that I do you'll do also see the church has to get to that place too and he promised it would do it and it will and it's got to come that way so you see that's what takes place we've got to be that way so Jesus Christ in action is what God will have and has in a bride amen do you realize we are an invincible Army that's what he made us by the anointing on us what about David he was invincible because of the anointing he could break the Yoke of the Philistine because of the anointing I want you to understand with this anointing you can do all things when you start letting the word start anoint your thinking anoint your thoughts anoint your words and then you begin to speak words that energize that bring Health that bring life that brings power but we're we like Sarah we doubt we fluster we get unnerved Sarah kind of got a nerved and lied in the face of God basically called him a liar so I was cerebral at him well sorry to tell you but brother Branham also doubted and flustered so do I so does every human so does every man of God I have a daughter of God Jesus brother Branham was as human as we are Amen brother Branham said about prophets they're not infallible men they make mistakes you're not infallible either you make mistakes I make mistakes and if you ever hear the account of the squirrels you will hear an account of a man questioning wondering doubting and having to be convinced I encourage you to listen to this I want you to write it down take a note on it even if you had to grab your phone to do it speak to this mountain in San Jose California November 23 1959 I want you to listen to that that's homework requirement of everybody I'd played the whole tape this morning if I could have the time but then speak to this mountain you will hear Brother Branham over and over and over and over telling of of the creative power of God while he is still doubting questioning wondering and yet when God can get him in obedience he is speaking creation but what is it was God showing us through the prophet that even though we get flustered and doubt that God's grace overrides our Humanity you see we have a part in this to play there's something we got to do we got to believe in order for it to happen and we don't believe that we're able we believe he's able this is what gave Sarah Street she judged him faithful he's the faithful God he's the able God there's nothing too hard for him this is too hard for me but not too hard for him now so we have a part in play you see God could not bring forth the promised son without Sarah he couldn't get another woman he had to get Sarah to believe that she was the promised woman and if God said I'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle or blemish and you try and you try and you try and you try and you try listen I want to tell you how much he expects out of you he said these words be ye therefore perfect how perfect Lord as perfect as your father in Heaven now that's the legalistic side of the coin whether they call it heads or tails it's the legalistic side and I can look at you and ask you he said be you therefore perfect are you perfect have you made mistakes is there imperfection in you why don't you try a little harder what's the matter with you anyway he said be you therefore perfect you're not going to make Heaven unless you are now let me flip the coin on the other coin is not legalism it's Grace and Grace says you can't be perfect so I'm going to make you perfect and I have to declare you're perfect in my sight you're loved in my sight amen is by as far as I'm concerned you're perfect you're my bride You're My Chosen me you're my left makes up for your life so therefore you become this perfect as your heavenly father is perfect Hallelujah but you see we have a part in this to play we have to be a people in action a people who is casting down imagination every hot thing that exalts itself against the word of God amen so brother Brandon said why did Jesus stand there and say to Mary and Martha take away the stone he was God and he could say Stone be no more and it would have been no more but she had to do something and when when he's why do you stand there and look upon the Harvest and you believe he's the lord of the Harvest he said to his disciples you pray to the Lord to the Harvest that he will send labors into the Harvest in other words you ask me to do what I'm going to do God put you in partnership with him for you to speak what his will is in order to bring that will into existence he said we're buddies it's a church we got to do something ourselves you've got to do something you got something to do here's the gospel I know it but if you just sit there don't preach it what good is it going to do you've got to do something you got something to do you got to make an effort you say well I believe God can heal but I just don't know stand up and let the word become your word and believe it don't reason it just believe it but you've got to believe and then that falls into an atmosphere of faith and has got to produce now I want you to get understand the word of God has C is a seed and it has power in it life within it but the only way it can come forth a seed has to be in the right atmosphere and it has to be in the atmosphere of Faith to produce now when we we all probably if you're message Believers have been around very long you probably heard of brother Branham having a vision of the silver Grizzly and how that came to pass just exactly but then again he had another vision of a of a brown bear and he he saw it and and how big it was and described it and and everything else and said I I was with some young fellows and so on like that and and I I got this Mammoth brown bear now that's the vision now I want to show you something here's the vision come on the word of God is your vision it speaks of you amen now brother Branham because and he calls it because of frustration and doubting and not acting like a servant he said the vision came and came to pass just exactly but he said I was not standing there because my faith would not move me up into that place so brother Branham never collected that bear though he had a vision of it now and he would stand in the message count down and he'd say and and in his presence there's three of them right there in a row right after he comes off of that hunting trip and he says I apologize before God and the people are being stupid and making many mistakes he looks at what he has done his misdivision he is disobeyed the word of God because he disobeyed it didn't walk with the vision he wasn't blessed you know God gives a vision of your healing but if you don't walk with it if you don't accept it as your own if you don't if you don't move up into that it's going to happen for somebody and it could happen for you because it's for all believers but you can sit there and doubt and say well maybe next time maybe another day make excuses well my problem's worse it's too hard you know nobody like mine has ever overcome this and the message count down brother Branham said he said I've gone on 32 years of ministry I've tried to stay true to the word I don't know one thing I've had to alter on because I've read it out the Bible and just what the Bible said and Let It Go like that and I hadn't had to take it back or rearrange because I said it just the way the Bible says it and I find out if God has spoken anything then we must go with that word in order to make it be fulfilled now he's referencing missing his vision we've seen that as I told you last night of a vision recently that he just apologized for being stupid I'm just quoting what he said and he says um that and he apologized for that and he said and he said we must go with that word in order to be fulfilled we just seen that as I told you last night of a vision just recently I had to be there and warn him to be there and telling me six months before to be on that spot and stand there and saying go down there three times with them and I just walked on with the other men and the vision passed right through exactly God's part and I was left standing so we want to remember you've got to stay on the word just stay right with the word and where the word leads you go right with that word and it'll bring you all out so then in the night service and in his presence he's praying he's repenting he said my hands up Lord what will I do now father I have got so many things I do wrong I've just confessed my sin this morning before the churches I confessed it to you on the top of the mountain the other morning when it was blowing and snowing up there on the top of the mountain to how I cried out and ask you to forgive me for my stupidity and I had dreaded to come before my brother who I have some of them regard me as your Prophet servant and Lord how I hated it come before them and tell them of a stupid act that I would do a thing like that but God is good for my soul that I confess my sins and not hide them so to be honest with you and right before the people I've confessed it Lord I'm wrong I'm all together wrong and I pray forgiveness this is a prophet because Elijah was a man of light passion as we all are come on he had his ups and downs he had his faults his failures he had his shortcomings and then and of course the squirrels the same way that I just told you to go and listen to is very plain you'll you'll hear a man say you know questioning wondering second guessing himself pondered was that the voice of God wasn't it not the voice of God am I imagining this or what is it and and so he doubted he disbelieved it he become flustered but I want you to know this though that Grace overroot it to show us that in this third poll that in spite of our frustrations and our doubts and our fears and our unbelief that God comes along with Grace and overrides it and sends a super anointing now so with the third pull comes the super anointing with this word comes a super anointing it's more than a theology and he said that as he was speaking there of them squirrels when I spoke he said hey here come I'll call it a super anointed swept over again and I was almost off my feet and said say what you will and it shall be given to you I want you to know that God was anointing a man with words that would create and he would tell the experience of his experience to the right family where brother and sister ride and their grown children Edith and Hattie and Shelby were present there with banks woods and they're sitting around the table and they're talking about how he said that was Saint Jehovah jira trying to get his promise over to me trying to in other words trying to show the power that's in this word and that he that I could speak by me just like Abraham spoke his need down at the foot of the mountain and he said the Lord will provide himself a sacrifice and by words he created a ram God providing the sacrifice through his words get the problem get the picture through his words amen and here Abraham looks at it there he said yeah there's the fire and and there there's the wood but where is the sacrifice Isaac asked and he said the Lord himself will provide that and God provided a realm listen we talk about speaking squirrels into existence it's been done through the Old Testament somebody helped me preach you know that a ram was spoken to existence what do you think would happen when he when Moses took his rod and and he and he and he hit the uh and and called for flies or or he called for mites or or Lucas or whatever he was creating under the blood of bulls and goats well how much more then when you're in the path of Duty do you have the right to take the word and speak your need [Applause] laughs little Hattie hadn't said a word she's just sitting there listening but all of a sudden she spoke out loud the what's not words watch your mouth Sarah what are you going to say Hattie you know be easy to sit back there and say well you know yeah God can do that I guess but he don't do that today oh brother Branham you're just trying to make yourself some Prophet or something you know you made all this stuff up nobody even witnessed this she could have said a lot of things but when he said this is that all I know it would have to be is Jehovah Jireh and little Hattie was inspired to say that's nothing but the truth she just simply agreed and she spoke it out loud and when she spoke it he said I heard her voices it swept from my ears and he said there come that super anointing over me and it come again and said the first time it ever happened on a human being and I said I the I give you now what you ask you have pleased the Lord with what you said don't you want to please God with what you say it'll cause the super anointing to come the right attitude that where you're sitting this morning hearing the word preached can actually move God on your behalf or that you receive your need Matt because of the attitude and the response back to the word of God that's why it's so important to get the right kind of atmosphere in the church amen amen with that when that little fish was raised brother Brandon says because him boys said the right thing they were sitting there on the boat and they said you know um we remember when that that old woman up there the little old lady up there on the hill she's about 90 years old and when we were little Jehovah's Witness boys we used to go around to give us bread and butter remember that old homemade bread said we ought to go up there and tell her we got saved and he said that was the right thing please catch this it's just the way you say things sometimes it changes the whole setup they said the right thing for just them the Holy Spirit dropped upon me from the heaven somewhere and said I said thus saith the Lord and brother Branham there in that atmosphere were the right things were being said that please God brought an atmosphere that brought creation and life it brought salvation to two boys so you got to get in the spirit because the words that you say bring an atmosphere and so do the thoughts you think the thoughts you think will create an atmosphere around you you're thinking dark thoughts there'll be a dark shadow hanging right around you amen I don't want you to miss this so wake up so brother Branham talks about it and he talks about atmosphere I want to just I want to talk about this because brother Branham knew the importance of getting an atmospheres he knew the importance of worship a lot of times people think well you know well brother Tim the way that y'all worship God and the way you're doing uh brother random would have never done that you don't even know brother Branham you're judging it by your own Baptist or Catholic ideas from preconceived denominational uh idea brother Brandon said and I want you to get this and speak to this mountain he said each night you'll hear this on tape when you listen to it he said the holy spirit is here wherever you go he's always there just remember he's right here he knows what you're thinking he knows your attitude toward the word amen and you're the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise will bring it to pass I can get you thinking right this morning amen the word will come to pass for you healing will be yours Deliverance will be yours Victory will be yours so listen he said he said well he's always there you'll never get away from him David said no matter where he made his bed God was there because the angels of God are encamped about those that fear or reverence him just think they are they just take their Camp they sit right down by you and watching you all the time if you get this realized for a moment you are in the presence of angels Sarah do you realize who you're talking to are we just another denominational group is that what we are no we are people that the pillar of fire visits this church amen that the angels of God in Camp about those that believe him that we are in the presence of angels this morning what's now brother Bradham used an old term we don't use it anymore but you'll get it in a minute we kind of changed it in this day made it a little more politically correct but I'm going to use it just so he said it and he sat down he said in our country down in the south we have a lot of colored people that's very spiritual and they come to my meeting sometimes and they sing a little song for me and I remember there used to be a little maybe an old colored sister ah if she couldn't sing that and just bring the spirit of God into the midst of the people she sung and brought the spirit of God into the midst of the people creating atmospheres and she sang all day all night the angels are watching over me and oh if she couldn't sing that and then brother Brandon says but you know I was a start your old Baptist and I just sat there and looked at it and grimaced that ain't what he said he said so I just almost had to tie my hands to keep from ruining the meeting just jumping up and down and screaming and running all over the place now you didn't think I did that did you but I do I don't but he does it in me and I believe that anybody felt the way I did they'd do the same thing it's just an experience so this little sister singing would bring the spirit down and brother Branham would respond to that by screaming and shouting and jumping all over the place and running all over the place that's your prophet that's my prophet so when it is open in prayer he prays like this dear God we are grateful to thee for the privilege of knowing the his personal savior knowing we have passed from death into life then that Spirit of Christ dwells in us and around us and among us and we're as people is called by his name and the angels Were Watching Over Us day and night they never leave they're encamped about and we can expect God to do most anything at any time because the presence of the angels of God who are commissioned by him to watch over us and care for us and father we pray that the angels will take their place tonight by the sight of each believer and all around down to the building you see because he taught us over and again the right thinking brings the angels to the Forefront the right thinking makes you realize their intent about us but it brings them it makes them known so when you get to thinking on him when you get your attitude right when you have the right atmosphere about you it draws the presence of the Angels to become manifested among you in power come on Church your brother Brandon told us he said you know empty senses because of sin in the beginning we were blinded to the Supernatural and and and whatever you know with with our first sense but he said when we leave from here said you know I and that's what I've always said there's not going to be an atheist there's never an atheist after death everyone who believes in God a little bit too late but everyone believes in God one breath Beyond here all these Earthly senses fade away that blinds us from seeing the supernatural Realm that angels are presents and brother Brandon said he he said things that you don't know nothing about now you see it plainly when you cross there that Veil you don't understand it now because you're bumping into it and you haven't got that sense you just say I feel real strange here look how it looks to me like I just want to cry or shout or something it's the angels of the Lord what amen you think sometimes that's just flesh brother Brandon said it was the angels of the Lord that was causing them to shout or cry or worship because they were bumping into the angels and when you begin to realize he's present that things begin to happen and when Hattie said the right thing there was a super anointing swept on me and said tell her she's found Grace in her in God's sight tell her whatever she asks said he knew what he would ask he knew God knew she wouldn't ask for a million dollars or new home he knew what he would ask he'd ask for her two sons so therefore he gave it there she could have asked but God knew what she was asked for and and he said he said there um by the will of God and by the power of God I give you in the name of Jesus Christ your desire and her two boys shook under the power of God and the whole building trembled and Banks felon just played and Shelby grabbed and had he screamed until you could hear her for two blocks that's what happened in a third pool Ministry amen oh I know we want to point out well when Jesus opened the book and you know and that was a greatest anointing ever gave and just precious words proceeded out of his mouth but when the third pull there was manifested to human being a super anointing came over there and a woman screamed out rejoicing that could have been hurt for two blocks you can't put God in your little box [Applause] I'm not saying you got to scream I'm not saying you gotta dance but don't put him in your little box and say we can't [Applause] because if you experience what I experience if you know what I know if you have happened to you what has happened to me you'd be shouting too come on amen that's exactly right now brother Branham after that experience he would he would go back and look in the Bible and he said look at look at kid look at Caleb there saying you know I'm 80 years old Joshua put this sword in my hand 40 years ago and I'm just as good a man today as I was then and brother Brandon said God be merciful to me I'll see examples in the Bible and he said I took my wife by the hand across this Bible and her little Bible and I said honey I have been too negative the Holy Spirit condemns me when I said I think of them squirrels out yonder I think I've had you right back there in these little boys I think of what God did so and he was God that could create Hallelujah I thought he told he said told me that years ago I'll not leave y'all never forsake you no man will stand before you all the days of Life I'll be with you and from this hand of discernment to come to know that you know the secrets of the heart and after that it'll race Higher and Higher and a year after that proved perfect around the world and here comes this other great ministry far beyond it I said honey I take your hand but God's help and Grace let me never be negative again let me walk forward to this revival tear to preach like never before let me go here to verse sanctify myself and make away from the people from that my own sins my own neglecting will be under the blood my own shortcuts be under the blood that I might walk out and say follow me people that's right I hate to see a guy said you go do it I hate to see somebody that but I like to see somebody that'll lead the way you see at some point you got to stop the negativity amen it ain't even spiritual to be able to find something negative about somebody else you're just fulfilling the job of the accuser of the brethren so don't judge your spirituality on your criticism now watch this for a moment brother Brandon said it's strange that this is taught to people they say well I'm weak you know a lot of people think that's spiritual that's real humble I'm going to be humble I I'm just a poor old weak Christian just barely make no no nobody think nothing of me I don't you talked me into it if you think that about yourself that's probably true well I'm weak you know there's many of you are so negative about yourself you look at yourself and your shortcomings and and whatever and and you know I heard of a blind woman and she got her site I something happens you actually raise this window up and thought she had latched it and popped her on the head and her side came and she hadn't seen herself in 20 years and she went and looked in the mirror at herself and all she could see was one great big old nose after her and she thought she was so ugly because of this big old nose and after a while she came to realize her nose wasn't any different from anybody else's but you see that's the way it is sometimes you know we look there and we find some little blemish some little flaw or I'm not this or some inadequacy you got to realize friends yes you got inadequacies but you see grace makes up for those inadequacies amen listen when Abraham lied oh God help me as I go here for a minute when Abraham lied abimelech had to get him to come pray for him and who just lied to him because God said that's my prophet and you're cursed until he prays for you you mean a man that just lied to me yes that's my Prophet I still respect his office I still respect this gift and besides that he's under a blood sacrifice take that devil they did this they did that they did that but we still got the power to tell you to leave devil we still got the power to cast you out to cast down your reason to cast down your doubting to cast down your fear well I'm weak my faith isn't very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then you must never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time I'm saved amen I I have God in my heart amen I believe him with all my heart do you believe in Divine Healing with all my heart let your testimony and always your thoughts and everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it and when it starts that don't entertain it entertain angels entertain the word entertain the thoughts of God but don't entertain the negativity you say well I can't help them talks from coming well be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he is short stop them from roosting amen so that's a good thing you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on no Jesus Is My Savior all things are mined by God and I'm going to keep them and I'm going to testify them and God can only bless you as you confess he's done it for you amen ye can only bless you as you confess so I confess I'm saved I'm Healed I've delivered I'm free from bondage I'm free from that complex I'm free from family traits I breed from the past I'm free from sin I am a child of the most high God I can walk through this wall with my shoulders back in my head held high but all true men of God and women of God have these moments we're like Sarah we get frustrated and we doubt and it seems like the longer the weight the more opportunity is given to doubt and disbelieve the promises we will get stirred enough to hope for deliverance and then go back into despair and we will give them lip service and a mental Ascent to the promise for healing or Deliverance but in a heart we begin to doubt we doubt and don't realize our position in Christ it's like Sarah doubted her position in the family of Abraham yes we want the position of being the bride of Christ but we don't believe we are what he said we are that we are the super Church the word said of us there's been Brides brides churches churches Brides bride but there's got to come one Hallelujah there's got to come a real bread there was must be one come that's not only the mechanics but the Dynamics of it that makes the church live and move in power of his resurrection see we are sometimes very content and satisfied having the the mechanics and the doctrines and the Mystery truths but never take our position of authority that goes with it you know there there again you know he tells Moses when he comes to an obstacle did you ever notice what God told him said and and he goes down to Egypt and said now you will go down to Egypt and you will bring these people out and you will come back here and worship me here on this mountain hello do you realize he just told Moses his destiny that you're going to be successful in what you're going to do that no weapon formed against you is going to prosper that I have set your destiny for you to go there and bring these people back to this mountain amen so what did Moses do praise God the Pharaoh got in a way he called down plagues amen he tormented the devil until the devil said get out come on it's time you turn the table on the Devil he's tormented you enough he told you how unworthy you are how no good how unfit how impossible it is for you to be the bride of Christ he's told you all of these things but God said you're going to be in a meeting in the air and I'm anointing You by a prophet to sit on the throne do you realize come on church amen if a Red Sea got in his way he wasn't to cry out to God and say God why did you get me in this horrible Jam you didn't tell me I was going to have a Red Sea in my way an impossible situation God had said I'm going to bring you back to this place he didn't say he didn't tell him the obstacles he just said I'm going to do it now what was Moses to do God said why are you crying to me hadn't I told you haven't I shown you my power haven't I described but I show you my love haven't I shown you my grace then speak [Applause] you see you're crying you're mourning you're seeing the wrong things to God quit saying that and speak positive go calling for the impossibilities to become possibilities he swim flow from this way west wind blow this way you don't move the Red Sea let's make a path right through it remember is speak and go forward but instead of speaking the word we speak the problem the Egyptians they're right here on that trail they're coming to kill us and they're mad now we're in all the firstborn are dead they're armed they got their chariots they got their best man they're gonna kill us all look at here where hemmed in this mountain this way and then surrounding this sea in the other it's impossible God said go forward I'm telling you this morning I don't care what your impossibilities are go forward to your promise amen you might be bearing like Sarah was but go forward to your promise you may be unable to do it but go forward your promise you may be a Barren Soul or bear in turn but go forward to your promise you can have Revival you can have the spirit of God move you see in your tongue is the power of binding or losing Jesus said whatsoever you're buying on Earth and be bound in heaven whatever you loose on Earth will be loose in heaven your words are you even an unspoken attitude can bind the promises of God and make them ineffective for you or your words can release the promises of God to you God told Moses to speak to the Rock instead of obeying Moses spoke to the people and called them rebellious you see God said to Moses speak to the Rock get and get the answer and said Moses spoke the problem and because of that he didn't enter the Promised Land what Moses did is an example of Idle Words instead of using his words to work for him and get an answer Moses spoke the problem and didn't enter into the Promised Land so when I ask you are you speaking The Word of Promise are you speaking your problem which one is bigger to you which one is God to you come on you make the medical report your God the medical for the medical report said this said that statistics said this now you're making all of that God make the word god put him in his proper place brother Brandon said when you get to thinking about Divine Healing get them thinking about Christ keep him on your mind if there be any praise any virtue the Bible said think on these things and if any thought comes by well maybe it couldn't be so maybe get your mind off your mind right quick think on things that's positive never let a negative thought pass through don't let it stop anyhow if it starts to keep your thoughts positive Jesus don't think sitting in a wheelchair that you're hopeless and helpless you are not don't let that negative thought ever pass through don't let it anchor you can't help from it go into your mind but don't let it stop amen and he said like the birds he said farmer keeping the birds away he said take a double barrel shotgun you know what you need to do every morning is load your gun hey man it's got two barrels all the New Testament take a promise from each one of them and arm yourself and when the Devil comes by burn his hide amen this time you put the enemy on the Run instead of running from your enemy amen brother Brandon said there's no negative thoughts at all in Christianity everything is past tense it's already finished healing's not what a man can do is what God's done it's a finished work salvation is not what a man could do or what the church can do it's a finished work and your faith in that finished work that Christ completed everything that was brought before the uh brought in the fall Christ redeemed it back in his atoning death vicarious suffering at Christ so you see there again we we got to change our thinking and some of us are worse about this than others just by Nature just by Nature you're maybe born with your nature that way some are Melancholy by Nature and it seems and really it seems sometimes that the more spiritual and gifted that that we are the more we realize they're inadequates because the devil sure knows how to point him out and just like Sarah we look at the circumstances I'm too old Abraham's too old this was really going to happen why didn't happen years ago When We Were Young you know we can't have a true Pentecostal experience and so we can be happy we're just an intellectual conception just given a mental sense of the truth you know God's never going to move but God is going to prove to his elect in this day that there is nothing too hard for the Lord and he was challenging Sarah to start believing that God is faithful that he's a faithful God amen that he says that he feels and that he can do exactly like he did at Pentecost and he gives overcoming power wow you said brother Tim you speak about that a lot well brother Brandon said himself God help me if I die pop her in the Pulpit I'll speak of the original Rock I'll speak of the original experience I'll speak of the Original Scriptures and give them the baptism of the Holy Ghost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the ever-present of the flowing Waters from the rock is still with us it'll bring forth the same thing it'll bring forth visions and bring forth healers let it bring forth prophecy it'll bring everything it did but our unbelief and our down deep heart confession is the main cause of our sin and if it wasn't for Grace God would just abandon his program but he can't go back on his word amen because our unbelief would send us to hell listen God Is So holy brother Brandon describes him that if there was a hundred billion sons look toward him what's there in the eternity way back in eternity he said when a hundred billion Sons would look back to him that's how holy he is Where Angels look dirty in his sight that's Jehovah amen and still he become a little baby over a manure Pile in a manger and that stood Jehovah and he's here he's here tonight through his grace into his blood and he cleanses his church and puts us in a position to receive all these blessings that he paid for so therefore we forgot to realize friends that yeah Angels even look dirty in his sight but he's got a blood covering for you [Music] yes he knows your thoughts this is why we need Rapture and Grace this is why we need the mercies of God otherwise listen with the demon spirits of unbelief that has been released in this day we would all be unbelievers but God is predestinated I said we're not going to go through the tribulation so therefore he's turned us from every imperfection to bring us into a perfect place for a perfect rupture amen as I listen to sermons of brother branham's I often would hear him say he would pray God forgive me of my sins I know it wasn't drinking or porn or adultery but just unbelief our own human weakness our inabilities to grasp the promise of God I want to emphasize this moment we take the scripture that said Paul said I keep my body under subjection that after preaching to others that I would become a Castaway and a lot of people are worried about becoming a Castaway somehow you know if I fail if I the flesh gets in the way God's going to cast me away God cannot cast you out get that thought out of your mind he cannot cast your way he can remold you and remake you but he'll never Throw the Clay Away come on now now Paul wouldn't see him now I keep my body under subjection or else I'm going to be lost I you know a lot of people say am I going to be the Judas am I going to be the betrayer am I I'm scared I'll turn out I'll turn out I'll be the I'll be the next Judas I'll be the next betrayer I've failed somehow don't think that because Paul wasn't saying that you're going to be a Castaway you're going to be like Judas be cast away but rather where God can't use us what borrowed Judas listen Paul nothing he had opportunity to repent and you got opportunity to repent and you may have been a Judas but you don't have to remain to do this how many times is it that God can't use us because of our unbelief you have to keep your thoughts under subjection or God's not going to be able to use you in other words he'll have to set you aside until you come back to believing again now you know that even the greatest of men have worried and wrestled with the thought of or the fear of being an impersonator afraid I'll just be an impersonator you're not yet you say well I know his presence like brother Branham said you know they they tried to tell him you're just an impersonator too that's what you are brother Brandon you're just trying to impersonate something and he said I know his presence and I know I love him and how could I be a devil and and love the Lord Jesus the way I do how could my heart bleed for him and he knows my heart and that's what I say you know your heart your heart bleeds for him you love him how could you be in Judas and loving the way you do how could you be a failure and yet you love him the way you love him he's not going to turn you away he put that love in your heart now sure we asked for things and brother Branham said himself I pray many times and he said I feel like I'm orphaned because there's sometimes I have to solve things out by myself and he said I I'm looking at something here and he won't give me a vision and he and and I and he just lets me alone I'm sitting as an orphan like this morning and I don't know which way to turn so I'm committed to the Lord your eyes you we know we get in that situation we don't know which way to turn we don't know what to do but we know this if we'll keep our hearts right God will lead us it will be positive about who we are in Christ God will give direction for our lives like I said many will struggle with a with that Melancholy nature of this demons that attack us with anxiety and worry and depression there's many prophets of the Bibles there was of that temperament so don't take any offense to it and it can be a weakness and it can get you in trouble it can make you a Castaway not in a bad sense it's your loss but where God can't use you because you took too much emphasis on your weakness instead of the emphasis on his power but you see if you'll surrender that to God your nature to God you'll be sensitive to the spirit and leaning on him and looking to him to to him for guidance but if it's been in the wrong direction you'll always be timid and like that Holy boldness to make the necessary steps so you always have to fight against these thoughts every one of us you're going to fight against thoughts of unworthiness or I'm going to be a failure or I'm going to be a Judas or I'm going to be a betrayer I just encourage you this morning just fall in love with Jesus with all your heart but even more than that accepts his love he will not cast your way to hell you're saved never to be lost again come on Church you're sealed by a spirit that there's nothing the devil can do to unseal you you know checking your life over and over and over and over is good but I'm just going to tell you God don't want his sons and daughters living at the altar checking your life over and over living with condemnation but he wants you to live above the altar my goal in preaching is never just to get you to the altar sure if you need to come to altar get there get that settled but after that writes about the altar you see live above the Altar and walk in obedience with power let me ask you something would you want your children I'm in overtime I'm sorry I was going to be good today but would you want your children living in fear that anytime they displease you in some small way that you're going to quit loving them that you're going to kick them out of the house you're going to abandon your responsibility as a parent to them no I'm sure you you wouldn't want that and neither was does God want that kind of relationship between his sons and daughters he wants you walking with your head up confident in his love assure that he loves you come on somebody that he will never leave you or forsake you that even in your darkest trial he's going to go with you amen if necessary he'll carry you but he's not going to abandon you hey man if necessary he'll correct you like you will your children but cast you away never you would be grieved if you thought your children thought that of you so does it grieve the heart of God when we act or prey in unbelief quit asking God oh God won't you just kill me if I'm going to be a failure just just kill me would you want your children saying that confess rather your sonship Jesus taught us to pray like this what he told us how are we going to come come boldly before the throne of grace amen come bone before the throne of grace that you'll find help in your time and need I've got grandkids that come boldly into my office they know Papa's got some chocolate back there and they come for their little their littlest gift of chocolate every service yeah because why of a position amen I may be Pastor I may be head of the church this may be my private office I may be busy but they're my grandkids amen come on now you've got children he may be busy he may be God he may be holy he may be all of that but you're his children come boldly before what a throne of grace for instance rejection help in your time of need they don't come down sneaking and you know is he going to take me out this time you know is he Gonna Roll me up like a ball and kick me down the Halls he's going to say get out my grandkids don't do that they come in boldly I'm trying to tell you to do like that come boldly Before the Throne of God confess your sons your sonship this is how Jesus taught us to pray in the example prayer he said you pray this way our father what is that relationship so that's the first approach to God is acknowledging relationship between a son or a daughter and a father and what's he say about being a father he said if I know how good if you being evil or being human being being a human know how to give good things to your children want thy Heavenly Father give the Holy Ghost to anyone that asks it he's not going to give you something evil in return he's going to bless you every way he can watch now so he said Jesus taught us say our father begin every prayer recognize and acknowledging God is our father and I want to say he's a good father father we're positioning ourselves as Sons that's relationship even in the story of The Prodigal the father never rejected the Wayward Son he never he never downgraded him to a servant status in fact when he came back into his presence he put him back in position as a son put a thickly garment upon him and a ring on his finger and place him in authority and threw a party for him [Applause] God's going to bring a party when you recognize yourself as a son we're going to have celebrations because you're going to start having Victory after Victory after Victory because of the Ring of authority on your finger dressing yourself as a son and taking your position amen this declares the restoration to sonship is the heart of God then he said Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come what is this worshiping him and acknowledging him as king with supreme power over everything so you come to him as a king knowing you can't ask too much of a king declaring you on his will and submitting to his will and then saying making your petitions now give us this day Our Daily Bread and this is a confidence the Bible says that we have in him if we ask anything according to his will and I want to say his will is his word if he says in his word he'll bless the barren women with children that's his will that's his vision for you if he says he'll bless you coming in and going out that's his vision for you if he said I bless you in the field or I bless you there in the city that's his vision for you so it's not hard to start praying the will of God and asking for the blessings of God because I know if I ask anything according to his will he's going to do it he wants to help me he wants to deliver me he wants to save he won't salivate me and then Lord forgive me as I forgive others let me offer the same thing that I've received to others leave me not into temptation don't ask to be tried don't ask for temptation but deliver me from the evil put your protection around me I need it Lord I don't want to walk another step without you I can't find the way alone and then you come right down there as you come to the end of your prayer and you say for thine is the kingdom the power the glory unending let's Stand Together I want you to walk in Victory with the mindset of victory I want you to walk in faith without doubting him about wondering whether he's a bad father whether he'll fail you or cast you away your Earthly father May abandon you he may have treated you like trash and said every kind of negative thing about you maybe you've lived under that lie but don't believe it no more you've got a new father and here is his words they're exceeding great and precious promises he'll be a father to the fatherless he'll be a lover to those who need love he'll give Grace and strength to the weary he's there for you he cares for you but you've got to care enough to receive his care I want you to Bow your heads with me just for a moment and I want you to separate from your your feelings from your faith you may not feel like a conqueror you may not feel well you may not feel Worthy but I want you to separate right now your feelings from your faith and I want you to accept what he's offered to you freely and I want you to say God I've been too negative Lord I have an expected blessings I didn't feel like I was worthy enough I didn't really feel like I was good enough and maybe it's for others but I'll never get it maybe I've had a little bit of an Eeyore attitude and oh nothing Good's ever going to happen to me and everything bad always happens to me I want you to start looking that your future is going to be better than your past that your past failures that from this day on you're going to walk in Victory that you're going to go from Victory to Victory you're going to see the glory of God in your life I'm prophesying over you now you're going to see his blessings upon you you're going to see grace upon Grace come down on your life in favor life has never been seen before he is going to bless you in your home he's going to bless you and your family he's going to bless your marriage he's going to bless your children he's going to bless you with loving kindness and Tender Mercies he's going to bless you with health in your body with strength with courage and faith and ability I speak these words over you in the name of Jesus Christ and if I were you right now I'd receive it in Jesus name raise your hands to God and say Lord that's me I accept it Lord right now in Jesus name thank you Jesus Christ [Music] [Music]
