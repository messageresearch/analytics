TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] You take me into the fire and make me pure as gold. You bring me out of the darkness into beautiful. You know the depths of my love. As you search my soul, I will not let go. You know the way that I take. Every step that I make, you will never forsake your promise. I find your word in my heart. It's truth I'll never depart. Let your power impart the more I [Music] love. You see the journey I take on this narrow road. You see my love for the truth. It's undeniable. You see the passion inside of my heart. And know I will not let it go. You know the way that I take. Every step that I make, you will never forsake your promise. I'll hide your word in my heart. This truth I'll never depart. Let your power in part of you. [Music] will never leave me alone. I am yours forever and you will never leave me alone. [Music] I am yours forever. You will never leave me alone. I am yours forever. [Music] You know the way that I take every step that I make. You will never forsake your proise. I'll find your word in my heart. His truth I'll never be more. Let your power come [Music] around. You take me into the fire and make me pure as gold. You bring me out of the darkness into beautiful. You'll know the depth of my love. As you search my soul, I will not let go. [Music] [Applause] [Music]
