[11:45] amen rest for the child open the Service
[11:47] force in prayer we want to
[11:49] remember to pray for
[11:51] Mr Nancy herring's niece's mother-in-law
[11:54] she's been diagnosed with cancer and
[11:57] expect her to pass away soon and asking
[12:00] for prayer for her salvation
[12:02] I also have a co-worker I've worked with
[12:04] for many many years that was just
[12:06] recently diagnosed with cancer
[12:09] told her that we would be praying for
[12:10] her her name is Lou
[12:12] and there's many other needs I'm sure
[12:15] tonight I want to continue to remember
[12:16] brother Tim as he's away brother
[12:18] Timothy's preaching in Arkansas this
[12:20] evening
[12:22] remember the Ron sister Erica brother
[12:24] Kenneth I mean if you have a need I
[12:27] don't believe he's here tonight to
[12:28] answer it
[12:30] [Music]
[12:34] amen sister Jessica and I went about
[12:37] this this evening to see brother Kenneth
[12:39] we had a good visit with him
[12:43] you know he is in great spirits but he's
[12:45] very very very weak
[12:47] and he very he has barely any voice so
[12:50] he's very quiet and you have to really
[12:52] get close to listen to him but we got to
[12:55] visit with him for a little bit and just
[12:56] reminisce and
[12:58] um
[12:59] you know brother Kenneth has been a
[13:01] testimony to this church
[13:03] you know how a man can go and go astray
[13:05] but yet God can bring him back to the
[13:07] fold and when God brought him back God
[13:11] brought him back
[13:12] it wasn't halfway
[13:14] but he brought him all the way back and
[13:16] he he church was his life it was his
[13:19] priority it was his focus it was
[13:21] everything that pleased him and I just
[13:24] told him I said brother Kenneth you have
[13:25] been a testimony for all these years how
[13:27] a man can go astray but yet because that
[13:30] seed is there God brings him back I said
[13:32] you've never missed a service
[13:34] unwillingly but even when you're in a
[13:36] hospital room you get out on a Tuesday
[13:38] you're there on a Wednesday and you know
[13:40] you're you're missed we miss you and
[13:43] when we was leaving I said brother
[13:45] Kenneth is there anything that you would
[13:46] like me to tell the church on your
[13:48] behalf today he said you tell them I
[13:50] love them and because you tell them I
[13:52] miss him
[13:54] that's a soldier Church
[13:56] a pillar in our church and yet we don't
[14:00] know what God's will is we know God's
[14:02] will is to heal but if that's on the
[14:03] other side he'd show me a picture he
[14:05] said brother Joe he said you see that
[14:06] picture right there
[14:08] he was about 20 years old he was a good
[14:10] looking man
[14:12] he goes I'm going back to that
[14:14] I said you're exactly right I said but
[14:16] if God is if God wants you to stay
[14:18] around a little bit longer we want that
[14:20] as well but if not that's what you're
[14:23] going to church that's the testimony for
[14:25] all of us this life is just you know
[14:28] it's a lot of heartache and a lot of
[14:30] Trials but we look Beyond this vessel we
[14:33] look Beyond this life look beyond your
[14:35] strains and the difficulties we got a
[14:38] new body
[14:40] and brother Kenneth if if gotcha Terry
[14:42] if he doesn't if it's time for him to go
[14:44] home what a testimony he's been to our
[14:46] church
[14:48] what a testimony so we just want to
[14:50] remember him and he just asked me to say
[14:52] that on his behalf tonight and I know if
[14:55] he could be here he's probably streaming
[14:57] he would be right there I said when you
[14:58] get ready
[14:59] we got a little spot reserved for you
[15:01] back there in the back so if God should
[15:03] Terry and give you strength and uh
[15:05] extend your days you know you got a
[15:07] place here at even like Tabernacle and I
[15:10] believe that goes for all of us this is
[15:11] home
[15:12] this is church to those that have been
[15:14] gone for a few Services welcome home
[15:16] Elijah good to have you home
[15:18] good to see you tonight and we got
[15:21] sister Danette here on a Wednesday night
[15:22] so good to see her
[15:25] church when you go around and you
[15:26] realize it
[15:28] we're a blessed Church to have what we
[15:30] got the body that we have tonight
[15:32] don't take it for granted every one of
[15:35] you are special not only to the ministry
[15:38] not only to the church but you're
[15:40] special to each other just recognize
[15:42] look at the qualities the great
[15:43] qualities that we each possess
[15:45] so different so unique but yet we're one
[15:51] so I just want to just encourage you
[15:53] tonight to look Beyond maybe some things
[15:56] that have happened in the past and some
[15:58] things that may have rubbed you the
[15:59] wrong way and let's just put our
[16:01] shoulders to the wheel and look to the
[16:02] prize to the mark of the high call and
[16:05] say Lord that's where I'm headed all
[16:07] this other stuff it's just futile it's
[16:10] just things are trying to get me off
[16:11] course but Lord my I got my eyes set on
[16:13] the prize
[16:15] so let's just pray tonight father
[16:18] we just feel your spirit even here right
[16:20] now Lord
[16:22] what a great opportunity that we have to
[16:24] approach your people
[16:26] come to recognize what a special people
[16:28] we are not because we have made
[16:30] ourselves anything Lord you called
[16:32] Abraham not because he was better than
[16:34] anyone else but because he was chosen
[16:37] and Lord I believe that this church here
[16:39] and those that are on the stream tonight
[16:41] those had to be getting the archive many
[16:44] weeks from now father I believe that we
[16:47] share something so special with the
[16:49] elect of God called chosen for this
[16:52] purpose for this age for this time
[16:54] and father my prayer tonight would be
[16:56] that you would bind us closer together
[16:57] than we've ever been before may we just
[17:00] let the bygones be bygones Lord let's
[17:02] put those things in the past may we
[17:05] press to the mark of the High Calling
[17:07] May we see the goal that's ahead of us
[17:09] Lord a new body
[17:11] a heaven a rain Lord just to live with
[17:14] you through the eternities Lord
[17:16] so I pray tonight father for a church
[17:19] you see how the Devils try to come in
[17:21] and kind of cause some division here but
[17:24] Lord I'm asking that you unify us closer
[17:27] than we've ever been before father
[17:29] God may we just wrap our arms around one
[17:31] another and said you know what the
[17:33] things that we have faced are not worth
[17:34] it let's move forward let's be an
[17:36] encouragement to one another as the
[17:38] Bible says encourage one another as you
[17:40] see that day approaching so Lord may we
[17:42] do our part tonight and Lord we want to
[17:45] pray for the needs that were mentioned
[17:46] those who are recently diagnosed with
[17:49] cancer
[17:51] God made your loving hand just reach
[17:52] down to them right now
[17:54] God made the healing power
[17:57] in the healing virtues that you so
[18:00] wrought in Christ may they just be
[18:02] extended to them in their needs Lord
[18:04] brother Ron says to Erica father it's
[18:07] touched them
[18:09] restore strength to their bodies Lord
[18:12] those weakened vessels God undergoing
[18:15] chemo and Lord just the difficulties of
[18:17] fighting cancer
[18:19] God may you get the total victory
[18:21] Lord we pray for brother Kenneth tonight
[18:23] that you'd restore strength to Him
[18:25] Father
[18:26] Lord his spirits are high his vessel is
[18:28] weak and we pray that his vessel will
[18:31] match his Spirit father but Lord we also
[18:33] know but if it's your turn your time to
[18:36] take him on to the other side for his
[18:38] graduation
[18:39] God may he not be in pain
[18:42] and may he not linger but father may he
[18:44] go with his arms wide open father this
[18:46] is what he's given his last 20 something
[18:48] years of his life for is for that moment
[18:50] that he'll meet you
[18:52] but God we just commit him to you we
[18:55] commit the Middleton family to you Lord
[18:57] we pray that your arm will go out to the
[18:59] family the sons and the daughters Lord
[19:02] of that family that are wavered in
[19:03] astray right now
[19:05] May the loving God come down I may may
[19:08] they witness to the life of their father
[19:11] and their grandfather a real Christian a
[19:13] real believer and may they begin to
[19:16] hunger for what he possessed so we just
[19:18] Commit This Time to you tonight I ask
[19:20] that you will use brother Aaron

[34:05] people something to look at
[34:07] and as I was uh
[34:10] I was mowing out here on Monday and the
[34:13] Lord dropped this thought into my heart
[34:15] it just came to me while I was there on
[34:17] the lawnmower and I he began to deal
[34:19] with me personally about
[34:22] some of my own attitudes and my own
[34:24] thoughts and reminded me once again why
[34:27] we do what we do
[34:29] why do we come together why do we have
[34:32] church
[34:33] why why was the message sent in this day
[34:36] what was it sent to restore us and and
[34:38] are we just another religion or are we
[34:40] just a group of people or are we
[34:42] striving towards a goal
[34:45] are we still looking at the promise are
[34:47] we still remembering who we are called
[34:49] to be
[34:51] and he began to deal with me and and
[34:53] just gave me so many different
[34:54] scriptures and quotes and things and I
[34:57] just wanted to bring it to you tonight
[34:58] and pray that he'll help me acts 2-1
[35:00] we're going to speak tonight on The
[35:03] Power of One mind
[35:05] The Power of One mind
[35:08] it says and when the day of Pentecost
[35:10] was fully come they were all with one
[35:13] Accord in one place
[35:15] and suddenly there came a sound from
[35:17] Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and
[35:21] it filled all the house where they were
[35:22] sitting and there appeared unto them
[35:24] cloven tongues like as of a fire and
[35:27] it's set upon each of them and they were
[35:29] all filled with the Holy Ghost and began
[35:32] to speak with other tongues as the
[35:34] spirit gave them utterance amen pray
[35:37] that the Lord will add his Blessing to
[35:38] the word as you have your seats this
[35:40] evening and
[35:42] we're going to try this tonight to be
[35:44] maybe kind of how it is with the youth
[35:46] Bible study and
[35:48] I'm gonna try to control this we'll see
[35:50] how this goes
[35:52] but verse 1 here says that they were all
[35:54] in one Accord and in other places it
[35:57] says similar things it'll say they're in
[35:59] one mind and one Accord uh many places
[36:03] just like here it just speaks of them
[36:04] being in one Accord and sometimes one
[36:07] mind one Accord things like that are are
[36:10] interpreted almost interchangeably that
[36:12] they mean the same thing but as we look
[36:15] through this tonight being in one Accord
[36:17] refers to a Unity of purpose
[36:21] it's a Unity of purpose in other words
[36:24] we all have the same purpose that's what
[36:28] it's saying here when the day of
[36:29] Pentecost was fully come they were in
[36:32] unity of purpose
[36:34] their mind was all on the same thing and
[36:36] they have the same goals and and what
[36:39] happens is when we focus on the same
[36:41] things and we have the same goals it
[36:43] brings about a Unity
[36:45] whenever we can keep our eyes on the
[36:48] same goal and it unifies a people and
[36:51] and goals bring about unity and as we
[36:54] look at this we often in this church
[36:56] Preach about another book of Acts and we
[36:59] talk about a repeat of the book of Acts
[37:01] and the prophet would tell us that if
[37:03] that vine ever puts forth another Branch
[37:05] it would write another book of Acts
[37:08] behind it and we've been teaching the
[37:10] church ages to to the youth and dealing
[37:13] with that first age and that early
[37:14] church and brother Branham tells us that
[37:17] that first church was the pattern
[37:20] he says there is no other pattern and
[37:25] he's very clear about this he says thus
[37:28] what the church was at Pentecost is the
[37:31] standard that is the pattern there is no
[37:35] other pattern no matter what the
[37:38] scholars say God has not changed that
[37:40] pattern what God did at Pentecost he has
[37:43] to keep on doing until the church ages
[37:46] close amen do you believe that tonight
[37:50] amen well be careful what you say
[37:53] because in order to believe that it's
[37:55] got to be more than just a quote because
[37:58] you've got to be ready for a lot of
[38:01] things to come your way if you're ready
[38:03] to say you believe that amen you got to
[38:06] be ready for for so if we're going to
[38:08] match that if that's what we're going to
[38:10] be we got a lot to live up to there's
[38:12] also a lot of things that we're going to
[38:14] have to be okay with if we say we
[38:16] believe that quote
[38:18] amen it's got to be more than a quote
[38:21] because you can't believe that quote and
[38:23] preach against the gifts
[38:25] you can't believe that quote and say we
[38:28] shouldn't have tongues in the church
[38:30] you can't believe that quote and preach
[38:33] against the experience of a new birth
[38:35] you can't believe that quote and preach
[38:38] against prayer lines because the church
[38:40] first church age had prayer lines amen
[38:43] I love how he says it here I'd never
[38:45] seen this quote before he says and we
[38:48] find that in the book of Acts the second
[38:50] chapter we find the kind of church that
[38:54] was decided on
[38:55] I love that God decided on this is the
[38:59] kind of church I'm going to have
[39:01] he says what type of church what would
[39:04] the church be this my favorite part well
[39:06] we're not all going to react the same
[39:07] okay how would be the reaction of the
[39:11] church when it received Christ how are
[39:13] we supposed to act when the Holy Ghost
[39:15] falls in the church he says in Acts
[39:19] chapter 2 it was decided on how you're
[39:21] supposed to act when the Holy Ghost
[39:23] comes in the church so if you want to
[39:25] know how we're supposed to act go read
[39:27] Acts chapter 2.
[39:31] he says I love that and I am earnestly
[39:34] contending for that church that was once
[39:38] established on the day of Pentecost
[39:41] do we believe that amen I do so so as we
[39:45] go into this I would like to encourage
[39:46] each and every one of you to go read the
[39:48] book of Acts
[39:50] look I'm sure you have before
[39:52] but go read it again
[39:54] go as I read through it I was it just it
[39:57] blows your mind all the amazing things
[39:59] that took place in such a short period
[40:01] of time you know if the early church is
[40:04] what we're supposed to look like then I
[40:06] think we ought to know what was going on
[40:07] in the early church I think we ought to
[40:09] become familiar if we're looking to
[40:11] write another chapter of the book of
[40:12] Acts we ought to know what the book says
[40:14] so I encourage you once again to go back
[40:16] and read that and as you read it and
[40:19] study it you're going to find a Common
[40:21] Thread
[40:22] you're going to find that anytime they
[40:25] have a great outpouring or a shaking of
[40:28] the Holy Ghost when there are Mighty
[40:30] moves and when there are Miracles when
[40:32] God is able to show his power in the
[40:35] church you will find Unity amongst the
[40:37] brethren
[40:39] every time
[40:41] that that is a theme there acts acts 1.
[40:44] we're gonna go through a lot of
[40:45] scriptures so just bear with me acts 1
[40:48] 12-14 it says then return they unto
[40:51] Jerusalem from the mount call Olive
[40:53] which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath Day's
[40:56] Journey and when they were come in they
[40:58] went up into an upper room where a boat
[41:00] both Peter and James and John and Andrew
[41:02] and Philip Thomas Bartholomew Matthew
[41:05] James the son about Fierce and Simon
[41:07] zealots and Judas the brother of James
[41:09] these all continued with one Accord in
[41:13] prayer and supplication with the women
[41:16] and Mary the mother of Jesus with his
[41:18] brethren chapter 2 verse 46 and they
[41:22] continuing daily with one Accord in the
[41:25] temple and breaking bread from house to
[41:27] house did eat their meat with gladness
[41:29] and singleness of heart praising God and
[41:32] having favor with all the people and the
[41:35] Lord added to the church daily as should
[41:37] be saved
[41:39] they're adding to the church daily and
[41:42] they're within one Accord there's not a
[41:44] bunch of bickering going on amongst the
[41:46] people to make other people go I don't
[41:47] know I don't want whatever is they have
[41:50] I don't want whatever they got but they
[41:52] notice these people are in one Accord in
[41:55] chapter four it tells us that that Peter
[41:57] and John are before the council and
[41:59] they're threatened and they're told to
[42:01] never teach or preach in the name of
[42:02] Jesus
[42:03] and they come back to prayer with the
[42:06] other as acts 4 verse 23 and being let
[42:10] go they went to their own company and
[42:12] reported all that the chief priests and
[42:14] Elders had said unto them and when they
[42:16] had heard that they lifted up their
[42:17] voice to God with one
[42:19] Accord
[42:21] and and said Lord Thou Art God which has
[42:24] made Heaven and Earth the sea and all
[42:27] that in them is remember what is one
[42:31] Accord Unity of purpose striving for the
[42:34] same thing and it goes on to tell us in
[42:36] verse 31 after they had prayed in one
[42:39] Accord what happens and when they had
[42:41] prayed the place was shaken where they
[42:43] were assembled together and they were
[42:45] all filled with the Holy Ghost and they
[42:47] spake the word of God with boldness and
[42:49] the multitude of them that believed were
[42:51] of one heart and one Soul neither said
[42:55] any of them that ought of things which
[42:57] he possessed was his own but they had
[42:59] all things in common and with great
[43:01] power gave the apostles witness of the
[43:04] resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great
[43:07] grace was upon them every time in one
[43:10] Accord
[43:11] every time in singleness of heart every
[43:14] time with one purpose chapter 5 verse 12
[43:17] it says
[43:19] and by the hands of the apostles were
[43:21] many signs and wonders wrought amongst
[43:23] the people and they were all with one
[43:27] Accord
[43:28] every time signs and wonders one Accord
[43:31] one mind and one Accord the Holy Ghost
[43:33] Falls one mind and one Accord Miracles
[43:35] are done
[43:36] every single time and then after this it
[43:39] says they're in one mind in one Accord
[43:40] then it goes on to tell all that is
[43:43] being done this is just two verses later
[43:45] and the Believers were the more added to
[43:49] the Lord multitudes both men and women
[43:51] and so much that they brought forth the
[43:53] sick into the streets and laid them on
[43:55] beds and couches that at least the
[43:57] shadow of Peter passing by might
[44:00] overshadow some of them there came also
[44:02] multitude out of the city's roundabout
[44:04] unto Jerusalem bringing sick folks and
[44:07] them which were vexed with unclean
[44:09] spirits and they were healed every one
[44:13] doesn't this sound like the kind of
[44:15] church we want to be at evening like
[44:16] Tabernacle come on sick folks come on
[44:19] those Vex with the spirit come on those
[44:21] in trouble they will be healed and
[44:23] delivered everyone that's the pattern
[44:26] that's what we're supposed to be but
[44:28] there's another part to the pattern they
[44:31] were in one Accord
[44:35] they have the same mind and the same
[44:37] goals
[44:39] here in the first few chapters of Acts
[44:41] it's a theme same goals same mind one
[44:45] Accord all striving for the same purpose
[44:49] and with that comes the results
[44:53] with that comes the Holy Ghost with that
[44:56] comes the Miracles
[44:58] they all have the same goal
[45:01] what was the same goal or should I say
[45:05] who was
[45:07] the same goal
[45:09] who was it Jesus
[45:12] what was their cry what was their goal
[45:14] Jesus we must have more of Jesus we got
[45:18] to have Jesus we got to show Jesus to
[45:20] the people we've got to give Jesus to
[45:22] the people Jesus has to be told
[45:25] everywhere people need to know about
[45:26] Jesus and it was burning in their heart
[45:28] and it burned in this one and this one
[45:30] and this one and this one and this one
[45:32] and this one and this one it burned in
[45:34] them it was the goal Jesus we've got to
[45:37] give the people Jesus and how could they
[45:39] give the people Jesus because they had
[45:41] Jesus on the inside to give it wasn't
[45:44] just a sermon it wasn't just a new
[45:47] doctrine they had the Jesus of Galilee
[45:50] now walking amongst 120 spreading the
[45:53] gospel everywhere
[45:54] what was the goal it was Jesus
[45:57] give the people Jesus
[46:00] that same life that had walked in one
[46:02] person on the shores of Galilee was now
[46:05] walking around in them
[46:07] and they weren't just witnessing
[46:09] although that's good
[46:11] they weren't just preaching although
[46:13] that's good
[46:15] they weren't just teaching although
[46:16] that's good they weren't just helping
[46:18] the poor although that's good they were
[46:20] demonstrating the life
[46:23] they were demonstrating the power of the
[46:26] Holy Ghost and they were getting people
[46:28] to the Holy Ghost
[46:32] time after time you'll read and they
[46:35] received the Holy Ghost I took these
[46:37] right out of Acts they were filled with
[46:38] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost fell on
[46:41] them the Holy Ghost came on them they
[46:43] laid hands on them giving them the Holy
[46:45] Ghost
[46:47] when Paul goes then he finds believers
[46:50] he doesn't say oh great
[46:52] I found Believers the first thing he
[46:54] says is have you received the Holy Ghost
[46:58] they weren't content with just having
[46:59] Believers but they were getting them to
[47:02] the New Birth they were getting them to
[47:04] the Holy Ghost
[47:05] listen I don't think we have to be
[47:07] ashamed that evening like Tabernacle
[47:09] that we preach the Holy Ghost because
[47:11] it's the pattern it's all in the
[47:13] scripture we don't have to be ashamed
[47:14] that we preach receiving the new birth
[47:16] amen we don't have to be ashamed that we
[47:19] preach Miracles we don't have to be
[47:21] ashamed that we preach tongues we don't
[47:23] have to be ashamed that we preach signs
[47:25] and we preach wonders we don't have to
[47:27] be ashamed because we're just lining up
[47:29] to the pattern of the scripture I would
[47:31] be ashamed if we didn't
[47:34] I'd be ashamed if we didn't preach it
[47:36] but today I say it's the same he's the
[47:39] same God he's a living God it's the same
[47:41] life the same power it's the same New
[47:44] Birth and we gotta get people to it
[47:47] Hallelujah
[47:51] acts as the pattern
[47:54] and if you're not pattering after God's
[47:56] pattern then what pattern are you after
[48:02] let's look at it there's a lot of these
[48:04] let's look at the pattern
[48:07] while we don't have to be ashamed to
[48:08] preach the new birth shame to the Holy
[48:10] Ghost shamed of tongues shamed of
[48:12] Miracles
[48:13] Acts 2 and 4 and they were all filled
[48:15] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[48:17] with other tongues pattern
[48:20] as the spirit gave them utterance
[48:23] Acts 3 and 6 then Peter said Silver and
[48:26] Gold Have I None but such as I have I
[48:27] give thee in the name of Jesus Christ of
[48:30] Nazareth rise up and walk
[48:33] well I'm shocked he didn't break into
[48:36] expounding the seals and and then the
[48:39] godhead and do you understand that the
[48:41] mystery of the godhead
[48:43] I have a new doctrine to give you I have
[48:45] a book to hand you no
[48:47] he gave him life
[48:49] he demonstrated the same life
[48:52] five and six
[48:55] there came also a multitude out of the
[48:58] Cities round about unto Jerusalem
[49:00] bringing sick folks and them which were
[49:02] vexed with unclean spirits and they were
[49:04] healed everyone acts 6 and 8 and Stephen
[49:08] Full of faith and power did great
[49:11] wonders and miracles amongst the people
[49:13] pattern
[49:16] well I don't think we need super men and
[49:19] super preachers and these testifying of
[49:21] the book of Acts testified about
[49:23] everything they did
[49:26] the books of the book of Acts bragged
[49:28] about it
[49:29] I don't have a problem bragging on my
[49:31] God
[49:32] I don't have a problem telling what my
[49:34] gods do and that my God still saves my
[49:37] God still heals my God still delivers my
[49:39] God still fills with the spirit my God
[49:41] still sets free from lukewarmness my
[49:43] God's Gonna Change my body my God's
[49:45] Gonna Take Me In A Rapture my God is a
[49:47] warrior God my God overcomes every devil
[49:50] in hell I don't have a problem bragged
[49:53] about my God tell the world who he is
[49:56] show the world who he is
[50:00] Acts 8. six through seven
[50:03] and the people with one Accord gave heed
[50:06] unto those things which Philip spake
[50:07] hearing and seeing the Miracles which he
[50:10] did
[50:11] for unclean spirits crying with loud
[50:13] voices came out of many that were
[50:15] possessed with them and many taken with
[50:17] palsies that were lame were healed
[50:21] pattern
[50:24] brother Branham says that the true
[50:26] church will always try to emulate
[50:31] try to be like that first church
[50:34] acts 15 and 12 then all the multitude
[50:37] kept silent and gave audience to
[50:39] Barnabas and Paul declaring What
[50:41] miracles and wonders God had wrought
[50:43] among the Gentiles by them
[50:47] and when Paul had laid his hands upon
[50:49] them the Holy Ghost came on them and
[50:52] they spake with tongues and prophesied
[50:56] well we're not supposed to prophesy
[50:58] pattern
[51:01] I know this is very fourth gradish
[51:04] but the scripture makes it pretty simple
[51:07] the scripture lays it out I I purposely
[51:10] went scripture after scripture and quote
[51:12] after quote so you can't leave going
[51:14] that's the opinion of even even like
[51:16] Tabernacle that's the opinion of brother
[51:19] Aaron that's the opinion of brother Joe
[51:20] or brother Timothy or brother Tim this
[51:22] is the scripture
[51:25] acts 28
[51:27] 9 and it came to pass that the father of
[51:30] Publius lay sick of a fever and of a
[51:32] bloody flux to whom Paul entered in and
[51:34] prayed and laid his hands on him and
[51:36] healed him so when this was done others
[51:39] also which had diseases in the island
[51:40] came and were healed
[51:44] well I believe y'all Focus too much on
[51:46] the gifts and the Supernatural and it's
[51:48] the pattern we can't preach it enough if
[51:52] anything we don't say it enough We Don't
[51:56] Preach it enough we don't see it enough
[51:58] this is the pattern
[52:01] we should come every service believe and
[52:03] there's going to be healing there's
[52:05] going to be salvation there's going to
[52:07] be Deliverance devils are going to be
[52:08] cast out prison bars are going to come
[52:11] open it has to it has to because it has
[52:14] to repeat again if we come in the same
[52:18] way they came in one mind
[52:21] and one Accord
[52:23] it's the pattern
[52:25] the pattern is to fulfill John 14 12.
[52:30] that was their goal they were focused
[52:32] what was their goal to manifest Jesus
[52:36] it was their goal to fulfill John 14 12.
[52:39] we look at it and go well somebody's
[52:41] going to do it no they woke up every day
[52:42] going come on we got people to heal
[52:45] we got Devils to go cast out there's
[52:48] people on Wednesday night going to
[52:49] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[52:51] can't wait to get there I'm ready
[52:54] listen there's too many of us that
[52:55] Wednesday night service interrupts our
[52:57] schedule
[52:59] and when it's something that interrupts
[53:01] our schedule then we don't come with
[53:03] expectation we come begrudgingly we
[53:06] gotta go to church tonight come on no
[53:09] sir I'm ready to go to church I'm
[53:11] excited to go to church I'm fired up for
[53:13] what God's gonna do because I read what
[53:15] he does in the true church I read how he
[53:18] operates in the True Vine and I believe
[53:21] that's me and I'm here to say pour it
[53:23] out Lord pour it out Lord that's who we
[53:27] are
[53:27] [Applause]
[53:30] their goal was to be full of the spirit
[53:33] listen the book of Acts was not
[53:35] satisfied with one time
[53:38] the book of Acts was not satisfied with
[53:40] being able to say well I was in the
[53:42] upper room
[53:43] imagine that
[53:45] there's a lot of it satisfied with
[53:47] saying 20 years ago I know I received
[53:50] the Holy Ghost
[53:54] good
[53:56] I mean I ain't mad at you I hope you
[53:58] have that testimony but I hope you're
[53:59] not satisfied
[54:02] I hope they're still a hunger and I hope
[54:04] there listen we already read it in Acts
[54:06] 4. the very people who received the Holy
[54:09] Ghost in Acts 2 gathered together again
[54:12] two chapters later not 20 years later
[54:15] two chapters later and they've gotten
[54:17] one mind and one Accord again and the
[54:19] building was shook again and they were
[54:21] all filled with the Holy Ghost again I
[54:24] say shake the building tonight Lord
[54:26] shake the building tonight shake this
[54:29] building shake my soul shake my heart I
[54:32] need another fresh outpouring get my
[54:34] mind back on the goal get my mind back
[54:37] on the purpose it's Jesus it's a Rapture
[54:40] it's going home getting me focused again
[54:43] Lord Jesus
[54:45] yes
[54:47] these are the same folks that just
[54:49] received the Holy Ghost and they're
[54:51] saying we got to get together and get
[54:52] the Holy Ghost
[54:57] they weren't satisfied
[54:59] they had to have more
[55:02] we can't be satisfied
[55:05] but when let's constantly be seeking
[55:07] more
[55:08] keeping our hearts and Minds centered on
[55:10] that one goal
[55:11] what's our goal more of Jesus
[55:14] we must match that pattern they woke up
[55:17] every morning on John 14 12.
[55:20] and they did it
[55:22] and then we're looking back at the
[55:23] pattern going we must match the pattern
[55:25] we must match the pattern
[55:27] listen if you don't want to match the
[55:29] pattern I'm not going to argue with you
[55:31] I'm just telling you the people that
[55:32] Rapture are going to match the pattern
[55:38] if you want to rapture
[55:40] match the pattern
[55:42] he already cut it out it's following
[55:44] directions it's simple this is what I'm
[55:46] coming for
[55:47] well I don't want to do this ain't for
[55:49] debate this is what I'm coming for
[55:52] Hey Brother Branham said in chapter two
[55:53] he decided what his church would be like
[55:56] he decided it's not up for us to argue
[55:59] with you we got to match the pattern
[56:01] I say let him move again tonight in this
[56:03] church
[56:04] Lord pour out another dose and even like
[56:06] Tabernacle shake this place again
[56:08] Jesus in our life Jesus in our services
[56:11] Jesus in our homes
[56:14] we must have him
[56:15] brother Branham says some of you trying
[56:18] to test an experience
[56:20] or trust it that they had 10 years ago
[56:24] he said that's all right but what about
[56:26] today
[56:28] you need one today
[56:31] is the day sure a feeling the disciples
[56:35] about three or four days after they
[56:37] received the Holy Ghost went back and
[56:39] got in one Accord and began to pray
[56:41] again with one Accord until the Holy
[56:43] Ghost shook the building where they were
[56:45] sitting amen
[56:46] what we need
[56:50] these early Christians
[56:53] they were human just like you and me
[56:56] with differences just like you and me
[56:59] but they were so focused on the goal
[57:03] they were so focused too focused on the
[57:06] goal to let those things derail them
[57:09] or bother them
[57:11] because their eyes were on the go
[57:13] and when you study acts you can find
[57:16] disagreements and you can find arguments
[57:19] it's called Humanity
[57:22] it's there
[57:24] listen most of us all we need to have a
[57:27] good argument is just another person in
[57:28] the room
[57:33] now multiply that but I don't know how
[57:34] many is here tonight 175 200 I don't
[57:37] know
[57:39] we've got some good arguments with one
[57:40] or two
[57:41] some good disagreements with one or two
[57:43] multiply that by everything around us
[57:45] multiply the book of Acts
[57:48] with all those people around us
[57:50] but the book of Acts isn't about that
[57:54] it's about the acts of the Holy Spirit
[57:58] not the acts of men
[58:01] and the takeaway from it should not be
[58:04] to justify our disagreements because
[58:06] well you see disagreements in the book
[58:08] of Acts 2 so obviously we're gonna
[58:10] that's not what it's there for
[58:12] to justify those things but what we
[58:14] should see is how people who are
[58:16] completely surrendered to God and have
[58:19] the same goal can lay aside their
[58:21] differences and allow God to move how he
[58:24] wants to move
[58:27] church if we can ever get in one mind
[58:31] if we could ever get in one mind I I
[58:33] thought about it the other day I was I
[58:35] wonder how close we've ever come
[58:37] percentage-wise
[58:39] I wonder what the closest we ever came
[58:40] to where every single person in the
[58:42] building
[58:44] did not have any other thought
[58:47] other than Jesus
[58:50] even tonight
[58:53] how many of us
[58:54] since I've been preaching have had
[58:56] thoughts other than Jesus
[59:00] me
[59:04] thoughts come
[59:05] but do you allow it to derail you and
[59:08] begin to dwell
[59:09] and begin to go down that path
[59:12] you see what I'm saying I wonder how
[59:14] close we've ever come to one mind and
[59:16] one in court to where we got our mind on
[59:18] the goal
[59:20] and when you get your mind on the goal
[59:22] then the differences and and the arguing
[59:24] and the things that we don't see eye to
[59:26] eye on begin to get pushed aside because
[59:29] I don't have time to look at our
[59:31] differences if I'm looking at what we're
[59:32] agreeing on
[59:35] if I'm looking at the Gold then those
[59:37] things are pushed aside and our
[59:39] differences don't have time to become
[59:40] our Focus
[59:42] you can always tell when when somebody
[59:44] has lost focus on the goal when when
[59:46] their focus isn't directly on Jesus or
[59:48] directly on a Rapture because negativity
[59:51] begins to dominate their conversations
[59:53] and their attitudes
[59:56] and it's just a focused thing it's not
[59:58] that that person's loss it's just their
[1:00:00] focus is off
[1:00:02] and you can't have a conversation with
[1:00:04] them without them telling you about
[1:00:05] what's wrong with this person or what's
[1:00:06] wrong with the church and what's wrong
[1:00:08] with this and what's wrong with that and
[1:00:10] who's wrong and what's wrong
[1:00:15] where's your focus
[1:00:17] what are you looking at
[1:00:19] what are you dwelling on
[1:00:21] but this early church who was our
[1:00:23] pattern was able to lay that aside
[1:00:27] the reality is in a in a group this size
[1:00:30] let's talk real for a minute I've talked
[1:00:31] about this with the young people we can
[1:00:33] talk about as adults if the young people
[1:00:34] can handle it you can
[1:00:36] in a group this size or even in a group
[1:00:37] much smaller than this guess what
[1:00:39] we are not all going to be best friends
[1:00:45] truth
[1:00:47] we're not
[1:00:49] and guess what I don't say that in a bad
[1:00:51] way that's okay
[1:00:54] that's okay
[1:00:56] that's life
[1:00:58] we're not all going to be best friends
[1:01:00] but all of us being best friends isn't
[1:01:02] the goal
[1:01:04] that's not what we come to evening like
[1:01:06] Tabernacle fours to all be best friends
[1:01:09] now we should all be able to get along
[1:01:10] in brotherly love there's a big
[1:01:13] difference
[1:01:14] but we're not all going to be best
[1:01:15] friends that's not our goal we are all
[1:01:17] wonderful people but my goal is not to
[1:01:20] win your approval
[1:01:22] my goal is not to make you happy
[1:01:25] neither should your goal be to win my
[1:01:28] approval
[1:01:29] or make me happy
[1:01:31] our goal should be I want to see Jesus
[1:01:35] I need more of Jesus I gather together
[1:01:37] because the scripture tells me to gather
[1:01:39] together and when I do it it shows me
[1:01:42] what I'm supposed to expect there's a
[1:01:44] pattern and so I'm gathering together to
[1:01:46] obey the word and I'm getting in one
[1:01:48] mind and one Accord so God can move the
[1:01:51] way God wants to move amongst his people
[1:01:53] that's the goal that's why we're here
[1:01:56] that's what we're doing move Lord Jesus
[1:01:58] Save Tonight Lord Jesus heal tonight
[1:02:01] Lord Jesus do your works tonight Lord
[1:02:04] Jesus
[1:02:06] that's why we're here I've got to have
[1:02:09] more of Jesus
[1:02:11] I've got to have I want to see people
[1:02:12] saved I want to see people born again I
[1:02:16] want people to be helped
[1:02:19] I want God to be able to move like he
[1:02:21] did in that first church and in order
[1:02:23] for that to happen we have to be in one
[1:02:26] mind
[1:02:27] and one Accord
[1:02:30] this is two quotes here the first one he
[1:02:32] says 1954 expectation when we get in one
[1:02:35] Accord
[1:02:36] then
[1:02:39] then
[1:02:41] God comes down see
[1:02:43] he says on the day of Pentecost what
[1:02:45] made the Holy Spirit Come this is very
[1:02:48] cut and dry what made the Holy Spirit
[1:02:52] Come
[1:02:53] they was in one Accord
[1:02:55] that's what made the Holy Spirit Come
[1:03:01] but Aaron I want to see move in every
[1:03:03] service
[1:03:07] I want to break out in this earth
[1:03:13] what you looking at tonight
[1:03:15] what's your goal tonight
[1:03:17] what did you come here focused on
[1:03:20] he says and now that's way we ought to
[1:03:23] be now and then the Holy Spirit can come
[1:03:26] on us
[1:03:29] it's so simple
[1:03:31] and yet because we're humans it's so
[1:03:33] difficult
[1:03:36] we went to work today there's a lot on
[1:03:37] our mind we got pressure there's a lot
[1:03:39] on our mind
[1:03:40] we've been sick there's a lot on our
[1:03:42] mind we're trying to raise kids there's
[1:03:43] a lot on our mind there's a cute baby
[1:03:45] three rows in front of me there's a lot
[1:03:47] on my mind
[1:03:50] or a bad baby either one
[1:03:53] there's a lot on our mind
[1:03:56] and so it's hard to push through the
[1:03:58] humanity we're not talking about sinful
[1:04:01] things
[1:04:03] talking about getting our mind locked in
[1:04:06] getting our spirit locked in getting our
[1:04:08] souls in one mind and one Accord
[1:04:12] so we don't have to agree on every
[1:04:14] decision
[1:04:15] we're never going to
[1:04:19] it's hard to get your family to agree on
[1:04:21] where to go out to eat
[1:04:24] or if you're in my family it's hard to
[1:04:25] cook something that everybody will eat
[1:04:28] imagine trying to feed the sheep and
[1:04:30] find something that everybody's going to
[1:04:32] eat
[1:04:34] come on
[1:04:37] you can cook steak at home and there's
[1:04:39] gonna be somebody that goes
[1:04:41] I don't eat it
[1:04:44] well me neither
[1:04:47] but that's what's on the table
[1:04:51] that's what Mama served
[1:04:54] and I can't help what the Lord laid on
[1:04:56] my heart tonight but I'm telling you
[1:04:57] that's what's on the table
[1:05:01] and we got to make a decision
[1:05:03] Lord am I going to eat it am I going to
[1:05:05] take it and recognize that maybe I've
[1:05:07] been one that's hindered
[1:05:10] I only say all this because the Lord was
[1:05:12] saying this to me on the lawnmower have
[1:05:13] you been one that's hindered
[1:05:16] have you had attitude problems have you
[1:05:19] had attitudes about people's attitudes
[1:05:22] oh no that's no joke that hit me right
[1:05:24] in the face
[1:05:27] have you been upset about other people's
[1:05:30] attitudes he said you're hindering
[1:05:38] I think I just made it to her no one's
[1:05:40] innocent
[1:05:44] but we want the Holy Spirit to come down
[1:05:46] on us
[1:05:47] and the more we're in one mind this is
[1:05:50] back to the percentage thing the greater
[1:05:52] percentage we get in one mind and one
[1:05:54] Accord the greater he can pour himself
[1:05:56] out the more he can reveal himself
[1:05:59] listen are you talking about us running
[1:06:01] around the building no the holy spirit
[1:06:02] moves in many ways
[1:06:05] there's lots of times where nobody gets
[1:06:07] out in the aisle and I don't mean the
[1:06:08] Holy Spirit didn't move in Mighty ways
[1:06:10] in people's heart I'm not looking people
[1:06:13] get it confused okay
[1:06:15] the Run and Jump and shouting dancing
[1:06:17] that I love
[1:06:19] is not the moving of the spirit
[1:06:22] it's our response to the moving of the
[1:06:25] spirit
[1:06:29] but we don't always respond that way so
[1:06:31] that's not even what I'm talking about
[1:06:32] I'm talking about him dealing with
[1:06:33] hearts I'm talking about him saving
[1:06:36] Souls talking about him Healing The Sick
[1:06:38] and delivering the bound and all the
[1:06:40] works of the Holy Spirit and if that so
[1:06:42] manifests itself in gifts and tongues
[1:06:45] and shouting and dance so be it
[1:06:49] but I want to make it clear I'm just
[1:06:51] talking about him doing the work that he
[1:06:53] wants to do tonight
[1:06:54] don't hinder what he wants to do tonight
[1:06:56] or Sunday or the following or even
[1:06:59] Tuesday in your home
[1:07:01] because our attitudes can affect a lot
[1:07:03] more than a church service
[1:07:06] it's okay
[1:07:08] if we don't agree as a matter of fact
[1:07:10] you don't even have to like me
[1:07:14] you don't have to like the Deacons
[1:07:19] am I wrong bro Joe
[1:07:21] yeah but you gotta love them
[1:07:24] bless their hearts
[1:07:26] there is there's a difference
[1:07:28] that's not our goal
[1:07:31] but what you find with mature Christians
[1:07:33] is that their likes and dislikes and
[1:07:36] their disagreements are easily laid
[1:07:38] aside for the cause of Christ
[1:07:41] and it's a maturity thing we don't
[1:07:43] bicker and throw Tantrums as if we're
[1:07:45] still in elementary school you may get
[1:07:48] just as mad as you did when you were in
[1:07:50] Middle School just as mad as you did
[1:07:52] when you were young but now you know how
[1:07:54] to go that's not what this is all about
[1:08:00] and you push it aside and you progress
[1:08:02] why why do I have to do that I wanted it
[1:08:04] so that he can have his way
[1:08:08] it's about him you have to be willing to
[1:08:10] overlook my faults
[1:08:12] and I have to be willing to overlook
[1:08:14] your faults
[1:08:16] you have to be willing to overlook my
[1:08:18] failures and I have to be willing to
[1:08:19] overlook your failures and together we
[1:08:22] have to be willing to let go of hurts
[1:08:24] and perceive slights and move past our
[1:08:27] differences for the goal
[1:08:29] and that's what they were able to do I'm
[1:08:31] going to mature church is willing to
[1:08:33] just do that push those things aside and
[1:08:36] what you're going to find is as we get
[1:08:37] closer and closer to the end in that
[1:08:39] Original Seed begins to manifest more
[1:08:42] and more and it becomes more and more
[1:08:44] apparent that the vine is sprouting out
[1:08:46] another Branch then Satan's going to
[1:08:48] come in and attack the very thing that
[1:08:50] allows God's work to be done
[1:08:53] Unity
[1:08:55] that's where he's going to attack one
[1:08:57] mind and one Accord that's what he's
[1:08:59] going to attack
[1:09:00] listen this isn't the time to be
[1:09:03] double-minded
[1:09:04] this isn't the time to be a Suede and
[1:09:06] pulled back and forth from one opinion
[1:09:08] to another it's not the time to chase
[1:09:10] after this thought or the or to be
[1:09:11] caught up in this debate or caught up in
[1:09:13] this argument it's time that we come
[1:09:15] together in one mind and one Accord
[1:09:19] with our goal on the Rapture our goal on
[1:09:22] seeing the Lost return our goal on the
[1:09:24] prodigal's coming back our goal on the
[1:09:27] sick being healed whatever you have need
[1:09:29] of tonight the depression being lifted
[1:09:31] off of this brother or this sister Joy
[1:09:33] being returned to that family marriage
[1:09:35] is being restored that's what we got to
[1:09:37] be focused on
[1:09:39] not the little silly things that Satan
[1:09:41] uses to come in and drive us apart at
[1:09:44] the end of the day we must remember we
[1:09:46] are Brothers and Sisters in Christ
[1:09:49] his blood that was shed for me is the
[1:09:51] same blood that was shed for you and it
[1:09:54] atones for me and covers my failures
[1:09:56] it'll atone for you and cover your
[1:09:58] failures as well
[1:10:01] brother Brown says and as the days grow
[1:10:03] closer and closer and the narrowing of
[1:10:06] the path we want to get closer together
[1:10:11] my
[1:10:13] we must be just one one body we must
[1:10:17] move together forgetting one another's
[1:10:19] sins
[1:10:22] and our differences
[1:10:24] and just dig in closer and closer and
[1:10:27] closer as we see that day approaching
[1:10:31] forgetting one another's sins
[1:10:34] and moving closer and closer
[1:10:37] you know I got to thinking about this
[1:10:38] and forgetting sins and hurts and
[1:10:41] trespasses and I got to thinking about
[1:10:42] humanity and and betrayals and
[1:10:47] and how hard it is for us as humans to
[1:10:49] move past things all of us
[1:10:52] it's sometimes you're like why is that
[1:10:54] still bothering me
[1:10:55] why is that it's hard to move past
[1:10:57] things
[1:10:58] and I was looking there at Peter
[1:11:01] and this is just me if you don't see it
[1:11:02] this way that's okay it's just something
[1:11:04] that was striking my heart
[1:11:06] the spokesman of Pentecost
[1:11:09] people would call him
[1:11:11] even there in Acts 1 but before the Holy
[1:11:14] Ghost Falls he stands up in the midst of
[1:11:15] the disciples
[1:11:17] and everybody else says gather there and
[1:11:18] he begins to instruct them
[1:11:20] and he's given instruction on what they
[1:11:22] all must do and I tried to place myself
[1:11:24] there
[1:11:26] as if maybe I was one of the disciples
[1:11:27] and how hard it would have been for me
[1:11:29] it's about me
[1:11:31] in my nature
[1:11:34] to sit there and go
[1:11:36] why are you talking
[1:11:40] sit down
[1:11:41] like somebody else who didn't deny Jesus
[1:11:43] stand up
[1:11:46] like for real like where'd you even come
[1:11:48] from didn't you leave
[1:11:51] and now you're going to stand up and
[1:11:53] tell us how to act
[1:11:54] why are you running this operation who
[1:11:57] put you in charge
[1:11:59] I I've been like
[1:12:01] no
[1:12:02] now somebody Boo this man
[1:12:07] I'm just these are the thoughts that's
[1:12:08] kind of like how what would my attitude
[1:12:10] be like
[1:12:11] just being honest because
[1:12:15] you know some of them had to feel bitter
[1:12:19] they had to be mad at him
[1:12:22] think look how they felt about he was
[1:12:23] always so Brash and so tough talking
[1:12:25] though all men should be offended
[1:12:28] because of thee yet I will never be
[1:12:31] offended
[1:12:32] though all men and he's throwing other
[1:12:34] people under the bus to make himself
[1:12:35] look good though all I meant brother Joe
[1:12:38] may but not high
[1:12:40] these others disciples they might deny
[1:12:42] you but Lord I would never I am Peter I
[1:12:46] might as cut a dude's ear off
[1:12:50] I would never do this
[1:12:54] think about how Brash he was in the eye
[1:12:56] he probably wrote people the wrong way
[1:12:57] all the time to be honest with you
[1:13:00] and he turned out to be the biggest
[1:13:01] coward
[1:13:03] who denied Jesus and thus denied his
[1:13:05] relationship with the rest of the
[1:13:07] disciples
[1:13:09] because the accuser comes up and some of
[1:13:10] them say you're you know Jesus you're
[1:13:12] one of them and he said one of them says
[1:13:14] surely you are one of them
[1:13:16] nope I don't go to that church let's
[1:13:19] bring it down home
[1:13:21] I don't go to that church I don't
[1:13:22] believe the message next Sunday I'm in
[1:13:25] the pulpit
[1:13:31] pretty solid analogy if you ask me I
[1:13:34] don't even know Jesus or any of those
[1:13:36] people a few days later y'all sit down
[1:13:38] and listen I'm gonna instruct y'all on
[1:13:39] what we need to do
[1:13:41] I have been pretty bitter towards that
[1:13:43] fella
[1:13:45] I would have had a real attitude
[1:13:48] oh now you want to run stuff
[1:13:51] the one who denied the one who cursed
[1:13:53] listen the angel had to tell them go
[1:13:56] your way tell his disciples and Peter
[1:13:59] that he goeth before you into Galilee I
[1:14:01] mean think about it they already wasn't
[1:14:02] even counting him as a disciple
[1:14:06] you can look at that how you want but I
[1:14:07] looked at it like the angel knew they
[1:14:09] ain't gonna tell Peter
[1:14:14] bang on tell him
[1:14:18] y'all go tell the disciples and Peter
[1:14:20] yeah you know you know what you was
[1:14:22] thinking you tell Peter
[1:14:28] how easy would it have been in that
[1:14:31] upper room for them to still be mad
[1:14:33] still be hurt still be upset
[1:14:36] and yet they had to let all of that go
[1:14:40] they had to forgive
[1:14:42] and even though they had reason to be
[1:14:44] upset even though somebody really did
[1:14:46] offend them even though they didn't like
[1:14:48] who was in charge they made a decision
[1:14:51] of a mature Christian this is not going
[1:14:54] to be our Focus
[1:14:55] that is not going to become between us
[1:14:58] we're not going to look at that
[1:15:00] instead I'm going to focus on what he
[1:15:02] said to us when we left
[1:15:03] their focus was he said if we came here
[1:15:06] we would be in do with power from on
[1:15:07] high his their focus was he said going
[1:15:10] to all the world and spread the gospel
[1:15:11] he said that the works that I do shall
[1:15:14] you do also he said you'll take up
[1:15:15] serpents and it shall not by any means
[1:15:17] harm you he said you'll cast out devils
[1:15:19] and that was their focus and I say
[1:15:21] tonight what's our Focus he said we
[1:15:24] would take up serpents and it wouldn't
[1:15:25] harm us he said we'd be just like the
[1:15:28] first church he said it would put forth
[1:15:30] another Branch just like that one that's
[1:15:32] my focus Lord pour it out tonight that's
[1:15:34] what I'm looking at you said there'd be
[1:15:36] a Rapture you said there'd be a body
[1:15:38] change oh I'm hurt I'm offended but I'm
[1:15:41] not looking at that I'm looking at the
[1:15:43] word the words that we can make it the
[1:15:45] words that we can have the Holy Ghost
[1:15:47] the words that we could be delivered the
[1:15:49] word said we would be a church without
[1:15:51] spot or wrinkle
[1:15:53] that's what we're looking at
[1:15:55] they began to focus on that and their
[1:15:58] mind was on that and they talked about
[1:16:00] that and they prayed about that oh come
[1:16:03] on somebody what are we talking about
[1:16:04] when we get together
[1:16:06] what's our attitude they talked about
[1:16:08] the promises they focused on the
[1:16:10] Promises they prayed about the promises
[1:16:13] and all of a sudden there came a sound
[1:16:15] from heaven like a Russian Mighty Wind
[1:16:17] may it break forth in this building
[1:16:19] tonight May our minds get on the go may
[1:16:22] it get focused again and may it begin to
[1:16:24] come over every heart and pillars of
[1:16:26] fire break out here and here and here
[1:16:28] and you get a refill it and I get a
[1:16:30] refilling and you get a refund and you
[1:16:32] get a refill it because we get back we
[1:16:35] need Jesus I need more Jesus I'm here to
[1:16:38] worship Jesus I serve God because he
[1:16:41] called me and he loved me and he died
[1:16:43] for me
[1:16:44] not because of something my brother did
[1:16:46] or didn't do
[1:16:48] what is our focus in this day
[1:16:51] what is our Focus
[1:16:55] what would it take to get the power of
[1:16:57] God to shake this building tonight
[1:16:59] to shake our hearts again
[1:17:03] to bring us back into Focus
[1:17:05] and let him move freely in an atmosphere
[1:17:08] where our thoughts is on him
[1:17:13] I broke this up into two
[1:17:16] it's the same quote though these next
[1:17:17] two it says you go to a congregation
[1:17:20] this one says well
[1:17:22] now at night time even in this little
[1:17:24] handful of people you sit here and feel
[1:17:27] one coming here and here and here and
[1:17:29] here just everywhere people one in
[1:17:32] thinking this
[1:17:34] one thinking that
[1:17:36] while I know they're why I know what
[1:17:39] they're thinking about sure I do
[1:17:41] God reveals it
[1:17:44] and one of them saying well Dr so and so
[1:17:46] said it was mental telepathy
[1:17:48] this one says well he's a spiritualist
[1:17:50] and this one says it's a devil
[1:17:55] and this one says I think those people
[1:17:57] are just emotional
[1:17:59] well I think that was out of order
[1:18:02] well I think he's preaching at me
[1:18:04] and this preacher sees it different than
[1:18:06] him
[1:18:07] and I think
[1:18:09] and I think
[1:18:10] and he says that's the reason the Holy
[1:18:13] Spirit can't move
[1:18:17] you see it's got to be one Accord
[1:18:20] got to be one Accord and then God's
[1:18:24] blessings and power will pour upon his
[1:18:26] people until we can get that we're
[1:18:29] fighting air
[1:18:31] truly
[1:18:32] wow
[1:18:35] until we can get that
[1:18:37] so brother Aaron are we all going out to
[1:18:38] eat on Tuesday no
[1:18:40] we're not
[1:18:43] that's not what we're talking about
[1:18:45] when we come to the house of God
[1:18:48] they all done
[1:18:51] oh that'll lay all that aside
[1:18:53] every hurt everyone as a matter of fact
[1:18:56] it ain't gonna be when you come to the
[1:18:57] house of God it's just time to lay some
[1:18:58] things aside
[1:19:01] it's time to lay things down
[1:19:03] it's time to lay hurts down and move on
[1:19:06] Beyond those things
[1:19:08] we have to be United around a common
[1:19:10] gold striving for the same things
[1:19:13] look we can all be striving really
[1:19:15] really really hard but if we're striving
[1:19:17] in different directions it ain't doing
[1:19:19] nobody any good
[1:19:21] and if we begin striving in different
[1:19:23] directions with different goals then
[1:19:24] suddenly our difference has become
[1:19:26] magnified
[1:19:30] things that really doesn't matter as
[1:19:32] long as you're focused
[1:19:34] but when you become unfocused suddenly
[1:19:36] those things become the focus
[1:19:38] but if we want God to move we all have
[1:19:41] to be willing to sacrifice what we want
[1:19:44] and how we want it and how we feel and
[1:19:47] lay that down and say God I just want
[1:19:49] you to move
[1:19:52] what is the purpose of this service just
[1:19:54] so God can move
[1:19:56] just so God can deliver just so God can
[1:19:58] do the things he wants to do what was it
[1:20:00] that Nehemiah said there in Nehemiah
[1:20:02] four and six
[1:20:03] says so we built the wall and all the
[1:20:06] wall was joined together until the half
[1:20:08] thereof why for the people had a mind
[1:20:13] to work in other words they all got the
[1:20:15] same goal
[1:20:17] they all got behind what they were doing
[1:20:19] they all began to look at it they all
[1:20:21] got in the same mind how did it get
[1:20:24] accomplished why did the wall get
[1:20:26] finished because they began to focus on
[1:20:28] one goal and they were all content with
[1:20:29] the part that Nehemiah told him to play
[1:20:31] and it didn't matter who built this much
[1:20:33] wall and who built that wall well my
[1:20:34] Wall's a lowly part and your Wall's at
[1:20:36] the main gate and well you're using this
[1:20:37] kind of tool and I have a different kind
[1:20:39] of more
[1:20:41] now they had one mind
[1:20:43] finished the wall
[1:20:45] finish the wall
[1:20:46] well brother Aaron did you hear about
[1:20:48] this and you hear they said that I'm not
[1:20:49] worried about that what I know is that
[1:20:51] laodicea is all around us and we need to
[1:20:53] finish this wall we need to finish this
[1:20:55] work we got to get busy with our mind on
[1:20:57] the goal that it's Rapture time that
[1:20:58] it's going home time and that there's
[1:21:00] people out there that we got to get in
[1:21:01] oh what what part can I do what can I do
[1:21:04] for the kingdom of God what can I fix
[1:21:07] you
[1:21:11] go back and study they all worked on
[1:21:13] their portion of the wall quit trying to
[1:21:15] fix your buddy's portion
[1:21:17] quit trying to fix my portion
[1:21:20] it's like I've been saying a lot lately
[1:21:21] how about you worry about you
[1:21:26] and I need to fix me this ain't putting
[1:21:29] off
[1:21:30] I need to fix me there's things that I
[1:21:32] got to take care of there's things that
[1:21:35] I've got to get in order
[1:21:37] in order for us all to be focused on the
[1:21:40] goal what's the goal we're to be
[1:21:41] pressing towards the mark of the high
[1:21:43] calling pressing towards a body change
[1:21:45] getting our eyes back on him and off of
[1:21:48] our brother's faults
[1:21:52] we got to allow the word to break every
[1:21:54] hindering spirit in our life
[1:21:56] we all have different spirits that
[1:21:58] attack each one of us sure we do maybe
[1:22:00] some people's is more glaring than
[1:22:02] others I don't make it any worse than
[1:22:03] somebody else's
[1:22:05] we all have hindering spirits that come
[1:22:07] and try to attack we got to allow the
[1:22:09] the word to break those hindering
[1:22:10] Spirits off our life and quit talking
[1:22:12] that that backsliders language of
[1:22:14] negativity focused on on people's
[1:22:16] failures and shortcomings
[1:22:18] quit folks listen this word is a
[1:22:21] positive word
[1:22:22] it's not a negative word it's a positive
[1:22:25] word and God's people are a positive
[1:22:27] people
[1:22:29] there are positive people
[1:22:31] who focus on what we can do and how we
[1:22:33] can overcome and how we're going to
[1:22:35] improve
[1:22:37] Satan's the one that comes and points
[1:22:39] out the accuser of the brethren
[1:22:42] every last little thing I say tonight
[1:22:44] God help me find the positives and the
[1:22:47] strengths of every person and let me
[1:22:48] look at them through that lens
[1:22:51] what is their positive what is their
[1:22:54] strength help me to find the positives
[1:22:56] in every situation
[1:22:58] help us to look at things through the
[1:23:00] right filter
[1:23:01] refocus us tonight
[1:23:03] refocus tonight on our purpose of why
[1:23:06] we're even here
[1:23:08] let's get in one mind and one Accord so
[1:23:10] the Holy Ghost can fall
[1:23:14] and as the early church recognized the
[1:23:16] power of one mind I'm gonna have to go
[1:23:17] quickly now as we're running out of time
[1:23:19] but as they began to recognize the power
[1:23:21] of one mind you begin to see throughout
[1:23:24] the New Testament it begins to be
[1:23:26] preached
[1:23:28] Romans 12 15 through 17 Rejoice with
[1:23:31] them that do rejoice and weep with them
[1:23:33] that weep be of the same mind one toward
[1:23:36] another mind not high things but
[1:23:39] condescend to Men of low estate be not
[1:23:41] wise in your own conceits recompense to
[1:23:44] man recompense to no man evil for evil
[1:23:47] provide things honest in the sight of
[1:23:50] all men Romans 15 5-7 now the god of
[1:23:54] patience and consolation grants you to
[1:23:57] be like-minded one toward another
[1:23:59] according to Christ Jesus that you may
[1:24:01] with one mind and when one mouth glorify
[1:24:05] God even the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:24:07] Christ wherefore receive you one another
[1:24:09] as Christ also received unto us the
[1:24:11] glory of God what you find here in this
[1:24:14] scripture is like-minded here means to
[1:24:17] mind the same thing
[1:24:19] like mind is to mind the same thing in
[1:24:21] other words all occasions of difference
[1:24:24] removed
[1:24:28] and all quarrels laid aside
[1:24:32] notice it says according to Jesus Christ
[1:24:35] there at the end of verse five According
[1:24:36] To Jesus Christ what this means is is
[1:24:39] that he's to be the center of our
[1:24:41] like-mindedness
[1:24:43] because we can be like-minded in error
[1:24:47] I can be really really wrong and
[1:24:49] convince you to agree with me now we're
[1:24:51] both wrong
[1:24:52] even though we're in one Accord
[1:24:56] so what it's saying here is is your
[1:24:58] like-mindedness must Center on Jesus in
[1:25:02] other words because you get a bunch of
[1:25:03] people together in one Accord and one
[1:25:05] mind or a group of people who agree
[1:25:07] together that doesn't mean it's the
[1:25:08] truth
[1:25:11] you can be like-minded in error
[1:25:16] you find that in Genesis I believe it's
[1:25:18] in Genesis 11 when they're building the
[1:25:20] Tower of Babel prophet of God says he
[1:25:23] says now they built a tower which I
[1:25:25] doubt that the modern science could
[1:25:26] build today with all their machinery and
[1:25:28] things because they were United together
[1:25:30] they had one Mind One Soul one purpose
[1:25:33] one motive one objective
[1:25:36] that's built a hot Tower so high that if
[1:25:39] God ever took a notion to destroy them
[1:25:40] again they'd run them right up into the
[1:25:42] heavens with him and there'd be no way
[1:25:44] that they could keep him from doing it
[1:25:45] or he could keep them from doing it as
[1:25:48] they thought and we find out then that
[1:25:49] they organized themselves together and
[1:25:51] we find them again completely out of the
[1:25:54] will of God
[1:25:55] so they're in one mind one purpose one
[1:25:57] motive One Soul one objective and out of
[1:25:59] the will of God
[1:26:01] so you have to make sure that you're
[1:26:02] like-mindedness is centered on Jesus
[1:26:05] because brother Branham would tell us in
[1:26:07] relation to the Builders of Bible and
[1:26:09] them being united that Satan patterns
[1:26:12] off the things of God
[1:26:13] and so he will cause people to be United
[1:26:16] but United under a lie United under a
[1:26:19] falsehood or United under a purpose that
[1:26:22] will hinder the move of God so the
[1:26:24] scripture instructs us make sure that
[1:26:26] you're like-minded in Jesus
[1:26:29] second Corinthians 13 11 finally
[1:26:31] Brethren farewell be perfect be of good
[1:26:34] Comfort be of one mind live in peace and
[1:26:38] the love of God
[1:26:39] and peace shall be with you Philippians
[1:26:43] 1 27 only let your conversation be as it
[1:26:46] becometh the gospel of Christ that
[1:26:48] whether I come and see you or else be
[1:26:50] absent I may hear of your Affairs that
[1:26:52] you stand fast in one spirit with one
[1:26:54] mind striving together for the faith of
[1:26:58] the Gospel in one mind striving together
[1:27:01] not striving against one another but
[1:27:03] striving against the common enemy one
[1:27:05] Spirit one mind
[1:27:07] and as I hope we've seen the scripture
[1:27:09] is very clear that there may be
[1:27:11] different ideas there may be different
[1:27:13] opinions different diversities of
[1:27:14] judgment disagreements on how things
[1:27:16] should be handled and yet through all
[1:27:19] this if we have the character of Christ
[1:27:21] then we will have a Oneness of heart
[1:27:23] and the ability to move beyond all of
[1:27:26] those things for the cause
[1:27:28] of Christ
[1:27:29] first Peter 3 8 finally be ye all of One
[1:27:33] mind
[1:27:35] don't know why that happened there we go
[1:27:37] oops still doing it it's going crazy
[1:27:39] having compassion one
[1:27:41] other love is Brethren be pitiful be
[1:27:45] courteous
[1:27:47] we're about to wrap these scriptures up
[1:27:49] bear with me another moment if there be
[1:27:51] therefore any consolation in Christ if
[1:27:53] any comfort of love if any Fellowship of
[1:27:55] the spirit if any bowels and mercies
[1:27:57] fulfill you my joy that ye be
[1:27:59] like-minded having the same love being
[1:28:02] of one Accord of one mind you think they
[1:28:04] didn't learn how important this was
[1:28:06] there in the book of Acts
[1:28:08] over and over and over and over and over
[1:28:12] let nothing be done with Strife or
[1:28:14] vainglory but in lowliness of mine Let
[1:28:16] each esteem other better than themselves
[1:28:19] this literally says you're to think that
[1:28:21] every other person is better than you
[1:28:24] it's hard for some people
[1:28:26] esteem others better than yourselves
[1:28:29] y'all are better than me
[1:28:34] it's hard to do it's hard to think that
[1:28:36] way
[1:28:37] why all these commands
[1:28:41] because they were dealing with the exact
[1:28:43] same stuff we deal with
[1:28:45] Humanity opinions upset hurt feelings
[1:28:50] scars bitterness the devil trying to
[1:28:53] tear people apart
[1:28:55] the devil knows the power of one mind
[1:28:58] he knows what happens when God's people
[1:29:01] get in one mind and one Accord he
[1:29:02] learned real quick there in the book of
[1:29:04] Acts he learned that he couldn't stand
[1:29:06] before people of God who were in one
[1:29:08] mind and one Accord he don't want us in
[1:29:10] one mind today he don't want us in one
[1:29:12] mind in this service he don't want us in
[1:29:14] one mind tomorrow and he tries to keep
[1:29:16] us split up and firing at each other
[1:29:18] brother Branham said if he can keep us
[1:29:19] quarreling he said brother Satan don't
[1:29:21] even have to fight
[1:29:22] oh but if we can get in one mind in one
[1:29:25] Accord I think we've seen what will
[1:29:27] happen we'll get the devil on the run
[1:29:28] tonight you've got a problem you got a
[1:29:31] sickness you've been bound down you've
[1:29:33] got some complex hindering you in one
[1:29:35] mind in one Accord you can walk out
[1:29:37] completely different completely
[1:29:38] delivered completely healed completely
[1:29:41] set free bitterness out of your heart
[1:29:43] how do you know I read the pattern I
[1:29:46] know what happens when God's people get
[1:29:48] in one mind and one Accord the power of
[1:29:51] God can sweep in this place and set
[1:29:53] every one of us free
[1:29:55] brother Brown says if I could get you in
[1:29:57] one mind and one Accord there wouldn't
[1:29:58] be a feeble person in the building in
[1:29:59] the next five minutes it would be
[1:30:01] instantaneous one minute bound the next
[1:30:03] moment free one minute sick the next
[1:30:05] moment healed one minute lost the next
[1:30:08] minute saved I say pour it out Lord
[1:30:10] Jesus I want it tonight Lord my mind is
[1:30:13] on you I want nothing but you I'm laying
[1:30:15] aside my thoughts my feelings my worries
[1:30:18] my doubts my unbelieves I say Lord shake
[1:30:21] the building tonight pour it out tonight
[1:30:24] Lord that's the desire of my heart
[1:30:29] not just tonight but every night every
[1:30:32] service
[1:30:33] Hallelujah
[1:30:36] listen he's going to bring backbiting
[1:30:39] he's going to bring division he's going
[1:30:41] to bring strife
[1:30:42] but if we can just push that aside
[1:30:45] and get together
[1:30:47] The Power of One mind
[1:30:49] his mind
[1:30:51] his will
[1:30:52] his desires we've been talking about the
[1:30:54] power of one mind
[1:30:55] look not every man on his own things
[1:30:57] that's a bunch of different Minds
[1:31:00] but every man also on the things of
[1:31:02] others let this mind be in you which was
[1:31:07] also in Christ Jesus there it is
[1:31:10] what are we supposed to be looking for
[1:31:11] brother here what's he want done what's
[1:31:14] his will how does he want to move what's
[1:31:17] his opinion about it what does the word
[1:31:19] say about it that's the mind we're
[1:31:21] talking about if we could all get in one
[1:31:23] mind where we're looking for his will
[1:31:24] and he is our goal in that mind walls
[1:31:28] fall down
[1:31:29] in that mind Spirits are cast out
[1:31:31] in that mind there is forgiveness and
[1:31:33] that mind the Holy Ghost Falls amen
[1:31:36] if we can get out of this mine and quit
[1:31:38] operating with our carnal Minds
[1:31:41] quit operating under family Cycles quit
[1:31:44] operating under what we think and
[1:31:46] operate in the character of the new
[1:31:47] birth
[1:31:49] operating the character of the new Birds
[1:31:51] where our filter is his mind come to
[1:31:54] church with what kind of mind brother
[1:31:55] Joe with a mind to worship
[1:31:58] come to church with a mind to receive
[1:32:00] come to church with a mind focus on the
[1:32:03] word yes yes you're gonna have to push
[1:32:04] past Humanity
[1:32:06] yes we're going to struggle with it no
[1:32:08] doubt but it's worth it look what
[1:32:11] happened every single time they were
[1:32:13] able to push past and get in one mind
[1:32:15] and one Accord you think for a minute
[1:32:16] all 120 people in the upper room love or
[1:32:19] like one another
[1:32:21] that may be the last time they all ever
[1:32:23] hung out
[1:32:26] they were told to be there and they was
[1:32:28] just doing what the word told them to do
[1:32:30] and they got in one mind and one Accord
[1:32:32] that didn't matter they went to the
[1:32:34] upper room with one purpose
[1:32:36] one mind brother and you said that a lot
[1:32:38] yeah that's what we're preaching about
[1:32:40] one Accord it is a serious thing
[1:32:44] one mind one purpose one Accord
[1:32:47] can we just show up one time like that
[1:32:51] if we could just do it one time if we
[1:32:53] could somehow
[1:32:55] Lord don't let me be the one that's not
[1:32:58] but let us show up like that one time
[1:33:00] and let's shake hell
[1:33:02] that's exactly it would Shake hell I
[1:33:04] think the heavens would open up and even
[1:33:06] if it wasn't Rapture Day we might just
[1:33:07] go ahead and go if we could all just get
[1:33:10] in one mind and this building one time
[1:33:13] I don't care who's leading singing
[1:33:15] tonight I don't care who's on the
[1:33:16] instruments tonight I don't care who's
[1:33:18] preaching tonight I don't care if it's
[1:33:20] hot in church I don't care if it's cold
[1:33:21] in church I don't care if the speakers
[1:33:22] work I don't care if every microphone
[1:33:24] squeals and the drums are off beating
[1:33:26] the piano's out of key I showed up to
[1:33:28] worship God I'm here to praise God I'm
[1:33:30] here for one purpose I'm not here for a
[1:33:32] concert I'm not here for a special
[1:33:34] sermon or some beautiful lecture I'm not
[1:33:37] here to see what people's wearing I'm
[1:33:39] here cause I need Jesus I need more
[1:33:41] Jesus born out tonight Jesus that's why
[1:33:44] I'm here I don't care about any of the
[1:33:48] other stuff
[1:33:50] love it
[1:33:52] one purpose
[1:33:58] nope you know what
[1:34:02] we need to have all of our services in
[1:34:05] August out there in that field
[1:34:08] we ain't gonna mow it we ain't gonna put
[1:34:10] up a tent we ain't gonna have
[1:34:11] microphones
[1:34:13] just so we can realize how spoiled
[1:34:17] how blessed
[1:34:20] we really are
[1:34:23] get our mind right
[1:34:25] and recognize how silly our gripes are
[1:34:30] you know and we're about to close
[1:34:33] but can you imagine some of our
[1:34:35] conversations in heaven
[1:34:37] you meet a new brother
[1:34:40] and you're excited to me tell me your
[1:34:42] testimony
[1:34:44] tell me
[1:34:45] tell me all about it
[1:34:47] he says well
[1:34:49] I was a martyr
[1:34:52] we ran from place to place desperately
[1:34:54] just longing one time to have the
[1:34:57] opportunity to gather together and have
[1:34:58] a service
[1:34:59] so we hidden caves
[1:35:01] and and then Dungeons and hideouts
[1:35:05] and they finally found us
[1:35:07] my children were taken from me and sent
[1:35:09] to the Coliseum they said I could save
[1:35:11] my children's life if I was just willing
[1:35:12] to recant the doctrine of the new birth
[1:35:15] and the godhead and I wanted to so bad
[1:35:18] but my children encouraged me said don't
[1:35:20] do it Daddy Stand Strong
[1:35:22] don't do it let me die for the faith
[1:35:25] so I lost my children
[1:35:27] and then I was broken on the Wheel
[1:35:30] they took and broke every one of my
[1:35:31] fingers and they tore my teeth out then
[1:35:33] they shattered my shin bones with clubs
[1:35:36] my intestines were torn out and set on
[1:35:38] fire while I was still alive
[1:35:42] then my hands and feet were tied with
[1:35:43] four separate ropes to four separate
[1:35:45] horses and they stretched every muscle
[1:35:47] and every tendon and every bone in my
[1:35:49] body until they snapped and all the
[1:35:51] while they did it I sang hymns and
[1:35:53] praised God
[1:35:54] I sang hymns as a matter of fact I found
[1:35:57] out when I got here that there were
[1:35:59] others that that that were so moved by
[1:36:01] the way I worshiped in my discomfort and
[1:36:04] in my torture that they gave their lives
[1:36:06] to God and they're here because of the
[1:36:07] testimony as I witnessed to the very
[1:36:09] ones breaking my bones and I told them
[1:36:12] about the love of God
[1:36:15] then I was quartered parts of my body
[1:36:17] were hung on The City Gate in the
[1:36:19] bridges as a warning to my brothers and
[1:36:21] sisters this is what happens to those
[1:36:23] that are willing to Worship in spirit
[1:36:25] and in truth
[1:36:27] of course it didn't hinder them at all
[1:36:28] it just made them get stronger and
[1:36:31] stronger and They carried on together
[1:36:32] and the more hardships that came our way
[1:36:34] the stronger we got and the closer we
[1:36:37] became and the more determined we got to
[1:36:39] stay in one mind and one Accord and our
[1:36:40] service has got greater and greater and
[1:36:43] greater
[1:36:45] tell me tell me your testimony
[1:36:49] were you a martyr
[1:36:53] yeah in a sense yeah in a sense I many
[1:36:57] times during our services oh wait wait I
[1:36:59] bet the authorities busted in and stole
[1:37:01] your children and arrested you and
[1:37:03] carried you off and beat you
[1:37:06] no but I did have to bring a sweater
[1:37:09] because the thermostat was too low
[1:37:17] oh okay there was another time too
[1:37:21] I didn't know who was preaching
[1:37:23] and so I came and had I known I would
[1:37:26] have stayed home and streamed a
[1:37:27] different Ministry from another church
[1:37:29] that was brutal
[1:37:33] and many times
[1:37:35] brother I endured song Choices that were
[1:37:38] not on my list of favorites
[1:37:41] and I'm sure judging by the attitudes of
[1:37:43] my brothers and sisters that they agreed
[1:37:44] with me that day we was in one mind and
[1:37:46] one Accord song service stunk
[1:37:53] it's not really that funny if you think
[1:37:54] about what we have to gripe about
[1:37:59] listen to this yeah I I yeah they uh
[1:38:02] sometimes if you sit in one place in the
[1:38:04] church the sound was dead and if you set
[1:38:05] somewhere else it was loud
[1:38:07] how about that your kids went to the
[1:38:09] Coliseum okay
[1:38:13] once I got to church late and the
[1:38:15] deacons they found me a seat it was
[1:38:17] towards the front
[1:38:19] you cannot imagine the Walk of Shame I
[1:38:21] had to go through as I walked up there
[1:38:24] and then
[1:38:27] it's hard for me to even say
[1:38:30] the minister offended me
[1:38:36] what's your story going to be
[1:38:40] what is going to be our reason for not
[1:38:42] being in one mind in one Accord
[1:38:46] can you imagine how we Stack Up
[1:38:49] to those that have gone on before us you
[1:38:51] say brother Aaron this is the most evil
[1:38:53] age it's ever been I don't argue that
[1:38:54] but it's the easiest age that's ever
[1:38:56] been to come together and worship freely
[1:38:59] there's never been another age that had
[1:39:01] church as easy as we have it with the
[1:39:04] blessings that we have with the light
[1:39:06] that we have and I don't even mean this
[1:39:08] light I mean the restored word of the
[1:39:09] hour worshiping openly and freely and a
[1:39:14] nice place
[1:39:15] there's nobody fixing to kick in the
[1:39:17] door and arrest all of us what will our
[1:39:19] excuse be
[1:39:21] I say Lord help me
[1:39:23] help me to come with one mind and one
[1:39:25] Accord
[1:39:26] help me to lay aside all these things
[1:39:27] help help us to raise up out of that
[1:39:29] carnality and operate from around that
[1:39:32] that allowed the book of Acts to be
[1:39:34] written
[1:39:35] what was it that allowed the book of
[1:39:37] Acts to be written
[1:39:39] one mind
[1:39:40] and one Accord
[1:39:42] says we have to get out of this
[1:39:44] dimension
[1:39:45] he says what we need is a holy ghost
[1:39:47] atmosphere that's right an atmosphere
[1:39:50] where the power of gods are moving one
[1:39:52] Accord one place gathered together under
[1:39:54] that atmosphere of expecting God to move
[1:39:56] down and do signs and wonders amen let's
[1:40:00] move ourselves up into that bracket Step
[1:40:03] Up in faith move out of these three
[1:40:05] dimensions up into the next one
[1:40:08] get out of our mind
[1:40:11] Church lay aside our faults
[1:40:14] I've got so many of them
[1:40:18] sometimes I feel like I got more faults
[1:40:20] than I do redeeming qualities
[1:40:23] he says how the devil talks to me maybe
[1:40:25] he's nicer to y'all
[1:40:27] I got tons of them
[1:40:31] I pray you'll look past them
[1:40:34] I pray you'll have Grace for me as I
[1:40:36] have Grace for you
[1:40:38] I pray that we'll love each other
[1:40:40] through the blood of Jesus
[1:40:42] and that when we come together
[1:40:43] recognizing that not only is my soul at
[1:40:46] stake but the souls of my brothers and
[1:40:49] sisters
[1:40:50] and how dare I be one that would hinder
[1:40:53] the move of God
[1:40:54] by not being in one mind
[1:40:57] in one Accord
[1:41:00] the musicians can come I have a quote I
[1:41:03] want to read as we close
[1:41:13] because I believe that if we get in one
[1:41:15] mind in one Accord
[1:41:17] he'll shake this place service after
[1:41:19] service
[1:41:21] I believe he'll shake this place today I
[1:41:22] believe he'll shake this place Sunday I
[1:41:24] believe he'll shake it next Wednesday
[1:41:26] if we'll just begin to lay more of
[1:41:28] ourselves down
[1:41:29] lay down more of our thoughts and accept
[1:41:31] more of his thoughts
[1:41:33] say Lord don't let me hinder I'm looking
[1:41:35] for another chapter in the book of Acts
[1:41:38] I'm looking for that and I'm looking for
[1:41:40] more of God I'm looking for more of the
[1:41:42] gifts and I'm looking for more of the
[1:41:43] Miracles I'm looking for more of the
[1:41:44] Holy Ghost I'm looking for more
[1:41:46] Deliverance
[1:41:47] and we're not focusing too much on that
[1:41:50] matter of fact
[1:41:53] he says just listen a minute how can we
[1:41:56] have the mind of Christ that was in him
[1:41:59] and then deny the things he commissioned
[1:42:02] us to do
[1:42:04] how can we place miracles in the past
[1:42:06] when the very Christ himself was God and
[1:42:09] God in you in the presence of God
[1:42:12] there's always miracles
[1:42:14] he said you call me Lord why call you me
[1:42:16] Lord and do not the things that I've
[1:42:18] commanded you to do I laid it out for
[1:42:21] you
[1:42:22] it's all laid out for us
[1:42:24] we just got to come in one mind and one
[1:42:26] Accord
[1:42:27] these things aren't optional
[1:42:29] Miracles are not optional The Works that
[1:42:31] I do shall you do also are not optional
[1:42:34] we got to get in the power of one mind
[1:42:38] his mind
[1:42:40] and this is what will happen when we get
[1:42:42] in that
[1:42:44] these quotes are all from
[1:42:47] India trip report 1954.
[1:42:50] says in every word in the Bible is God's
[1:42:52] thought lying in seed form
[1:42:54] that received into the human being and
[1:42:55] spoke by the same thought that
[1:42:57] materialized the Bible brings the same
[1:43:00] brings the thing to pass see what I mean
[1:43:01] how powerful could the church be
[1:43:06] the Bible said let this mind that was in
[1:43:08] Christ be in you as a man thinketh in
[1:43:11] his heart so is he
[1:43:12] now your thoughts if they become
[1:43:15] expression now if that same spirit that
[1:43:17] said let there be light and there was
[1:43:19] light
[1:43:20] said let there be trees and there was
[1:43:22] trees if that same mind that was in
[1:43:24] Christ be in you how much could it say
[1:43:26] let there be no cancer and it would be
[1:43:28] gone let the blonde eyes be open and it
[1:43:31] would be so see it's your very thought
[1:43:33] Jesus said verily
[1:43:35] you said that was Jesus but wait a
[1:43:38] minute
[1:43:38] he said have faith in God for verily
[1:43:40] verily I say unto you if you say unto
[1:43:42] this mountain be moved plucked up and
[1:43:45] cast into the sea and don't doubt in
[1:43:46] your heart but believe that what you say
[1:43:48] will come to pass you'll have whatever
[1:43:49] things they'll say us is that right you
[1:43:51] shall have it not me you shall have it
[1:43:53] what power
[1:43:55] has been given to the church
[1:44:00] but if it becomes a real revelation of
[1:44:02] God these are all in order I just had to
[1:44:04] break it up that you see it before it
[1:44:06] happened and express it in word form
[1:44:08] that word takes a hold and becomes
[1:44:10] material a thought expressed oh my how
[1:44:13] God could see it your heart and your
[1:44:15] mind is so filled with God's spirit
[1:44:17] until your thoughts become his thoughts
[1:44:20] amen there you are when you're mine and
[1:44:22] you're leading and your guiding becomes
[1:44:24] a direct place or a direct inspiration
[1:44:27] of the Holy Spirit that's moving your
[1:44:30] mortal being oh my what kind of people
[1:44:33] should we be
[1:44:35] if the very Holy Spirit has you so
[1:44:37] embodied and empowered that you don't
[1:44:39] use your own thoughts
[1:44:42] it's what I've been talking about that's
[1:44:43] what I've been trying to get to when we
[1:44:45] come here let's lay our thoughts aside
[1:44:47] when we come in here let's lay them down
[1:44:50] why are we here what are we doing what
[1:44:52] is our purpose
[1:44:55] you don't use your own thoughts you
[1:44:56] don't use your own mind you don't use
[1:44:58] your own opinions
[1:45:00] but the Holy Spirit has you so built
[1:45:03] until your thoughts and your being is
[1:45:05] God's spirit expressing itself through
[1:45:08] you
[1:45:09] what kind of a church
[1:45:12] would even like Tabernacle be
[1:45:16] maybe it didn't end exactly the way I
[1:45:18] thought it would that's okay
[1:45:21] I just want to ask you
[1:45:23] are you coming in one mind
[1:45:25] are you coming in one Accord
[1:45:29] or as church becomes something else to
[1:45:31] you
[1:45:34] really right now in your heart
[1:45:37] why are you here
[1:45:41] why do we gather why do we follow the
[1:45:44] message what is it we believe
[1:45:49] I'm believing for a rapture
[1:45:52] I'm believing for greater and more and
[1:45:55] more because I read through the book of
[1:45:57] Acts I recognize there's still some
[1:45:58] places we don't match up
[1:46:00] there's still some places where the
[1:46:02] pattern ain't exactly lining up I'm
[1:46:03] saying I'm going to match it
[1:46:05] I'm gonna match it
[1:46:07] I'ma do whatever it takes I'm gonna lay
[1:46:09] down whatever opinions whatever thoughts
[1:46:11] whatever ideas Lord if it's me hindering
[1:46:13] this service Lord help me show me move
[1:46:16] me get my attitude right
[1:46:18] because I'm looking for a Rapture and
[1:46:20] what I know is the same thing that
[1:46:22] brought down the Holy Spirit brother
[1:46:24] Branham said he came because of one mind
[1:46:26] and one Accord
[1:46:27] is the same thing that's going to bring
[1:46:29] him back to get a bride
[1:46:32] if it brought him down then
[1:46:34] it'll bring him back now
[1:46:37] so what is our goal Lord Jesus come back
[1:46:40] Lord Jesus save my children Lord Jesus
[1:46:43] fill me again Lord Jesus give me a
[1:46:45] refill and that's why I'm here that's
[1:46:46] what I'm longing for that's what I'm
[1:46:48] after that's my goal I'm in one heart
[1:46:50] with my brothers I don't see everything
[1:46:52] the same but we're in one heart one one
[1:46:54] mind one Accord Lord we're here to
[1:46:56] worship you we're here to praise you
[1:46:57] we're here to give you Lord the praise
[1:46:59] you deserve so you can feel me once
[1:47:01] again Lord so you can pour it out once
[1:47:04] again drop this bitterness out Lord I
[1:47:05] don't want it I want the joy of my
