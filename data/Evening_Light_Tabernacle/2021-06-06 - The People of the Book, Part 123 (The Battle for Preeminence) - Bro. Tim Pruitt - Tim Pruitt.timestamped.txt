[36:56] trusting the lord will just speak to you
[36:59] and illuminate his word to you
[37:02] amen revelation chapter 12 and verse 1
[37:05] and there appeared a great wonder in
[37:07] heaven a woman clothed with the sun
[37:10] the moon under her feet and upon her
[37:13] head
[37:13] a crown of twelve stars and she being
[37:17] with child
[37:17] cried travailing in birth and pain to be
[37:20] delivered
[37:22] and there appeared another wonder in
[37:24] heaven and behold a great red dragon
[37:26] having seven heads and ten horns and
[37:30] seven crowns upon his head and his tail
[37:33] drew the third part of the stars of
[37:35] heaven and did cast him to the earth
[37:38] and the dragon stood before the woman
[37:40] which was
[37:41] ready to be delivered for to devour her
[37:44] child
[37:45] as soon as it was born and so she
[37:47] brought forth a man-child who was to
[37:49] rule
[37:50] all nations with a rod of iron and her
[37:52] child
[37:53] was caught up to god and to his throne
[37:56] and the woman fled into the wilderness
[37:59] where she has a place prepared of god
[38:02] that they should feed her their a
[38:04] thousand
[38:05] two hundred and three score days and
[38:08] there was
[38:09] war in heaven michael and his angels
[38:12] fought against the dragon
[38:14] and the dragon fought in his angels and
[38:16] prevailed not
[38:17] neither was their place found any more
[38:20] in heaven
[38:22] and the great dragon was cast out that
[38:24] old serpent called the devil and satan
[38:27] which deceiveth the whole world he was
[38:29] cast out into the earth
[38:31] and his angels were cast out with him
[38:34] and i heard a loud voice saying
[38:37] in heaven now has come salvation and
[38:40] strength
[38:41] and the kingdom of our god and the power
[38:43] of his christ
[38:44] for the accuser of our brethren his
[38:46] counts down which accused them
[38:48] before our god day and night and they
[38:51] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[38:53] and by the word of their testimony and
[38:55] they loved not their lives unto the
[38:57] death
[38:58] therefore rejoice your heavens and ye
[39:01] that dwell in them
[39:03] woe unto the inhabiters of the earth and
[39:05] of the sea
[39:06] for the devil has come down to you
[39:10] because he knoweth he hath but a short
[39:12] time
[39:13] and when the dragon saw that he was cast
[39:16] into the earth he persecuted the woman
[39:18] which brought forth the man-child and
[39:21] the woman were
[39:22] given to the woman were given two wings
[39:24] of a great eagle
[39:26] that she might fly into the wilderness
[39:28] into her place
[39:30] where she is nourished for a time and
[39:33] times
[39:33] and a half time from the face of the
[39:36] serpent
[39:37] and the serpent cast out of his mouth
[39:40] water as a flood after the woman
[39:44] that he might cause her to be carried
[39:46] away of the flood
[39:48] and the earth helped the woman and the
[39:50] earth opened her mouth
[39:52] and swallowed up the flood which the
[39:53] dragon cast out of his mouth
[39:56] and the dragon was wroth with the woman
[39:59] and went to make war with the remnant of
[40:01] her seed
[40:02] which keep the commandments of god and
[40:05] have the testimony
[40:07] of jesus christ amen may god bless you
[40:10] you can be seated
[40:13] we're going to be speaking this morning
[40:15] on
[40:16] the battle for preeminence
[40:19] as you know i spoke of a dream that i
[40:22] had here lately
[40:23] were that i was preparing for meetings
[40:27] and um there i as i laid out things to
[40:30] take
[40:31] i had laid out a weapon that was
[40:36] just that just fit me and i was going to
[40:39] load
[40:40] load it and prepare with a couple of
[40:43] things that
[40:44] from what brother branham taught on
[40:46] christ is a mystery of god revealed
[40:49] and another was on um the you know god
[40:53] in his universe
[40:54] god and his son god and his people and
[40:57] so
[40:58] you know as i tied those two sermons
[41:00] together
[41:01] and those two thoughts together in this
[41:03] dream and was preparing for the meeting
[41:06] it has provoked me and caused me to
[41:09] study those sermons
[41:10] and just to look into
[41:13] the depth as i remember brother brad i'm
[41:15] talking about in christ the mystery of
[41:17] god revealed
[41:18] he said if you miss it come back to this
[41:20] tape
[41:22] and uh so you know we we always want to
[41:25] go back
[41:26] and look and make sure that we're um in
[41:29] steady in the faith that we know where
[41:32] what we're talking about if you haven't
[41:33] listened to those
[41:35] sermons of lately i think it'd be a good
[41:37] thing for you to do
[41:38] is to go back over those things again
[41:41] now um but in there brother bradham had
[41:44] a lot to say about
[41:45] preeminence and because this is one
[41:48] thing that he would do
[41:49] with with god would reveal himself in
[41:52] christ
[41:53] and then he would uh in order to redeem
[41:56] a people and then he would get
[41:58] preeminence in that people and once he
[42:00] got preeminence
[42:02] he would take them back to eden and so
[42:04] this was the threefold purpose of god
[42:07] what that god had in his mind as
[42:10] as brother branham would say it in the
[42:12] back part of his mind before the
[42:14] foundational world and
[42:16] we're in a an hour in a time where that
[42:18] which was
[42:20] hidden mysteries that were awaited for
[42:22] the end time
[42:23] we can now look back and see the whole
[42:25] plan of god
[42:27] revealed and and of course
[42:30] this is what god has done for us by
[42:32] sending a message in this last day and
[42:35] i want to say that i'm so thankful for
[42:37] the seventh angel
[42:38] and the sounding of that message amen
[42:41] because
[42:42] it it was a message as elijah was to
[42:45] turn the hearts of the children
[42:46] back to the faith of the fathers now
[42:50] um so when we're speaking about this
[42:52] battle for preeminence
[42:54] let's just talk about this for a moment
[42:56] because in the beginning
[42:58] god's word had the preeminence
[43:02] and apparently in the end god's word
[43:04] will again have preeminence
[43:07] in a people and so in the beginning his
[43:11] word had preeminence over
[43:12] all the earth and the heavens were made
[43:15] by the word of god and the earth was
[43:18] ruled
[43:19] by the word of god adam would control
[43:22] the atmospheres of the garden and and
[43:25] dress the garden by the power
[43:28] of the word but we know then
[43:31] we we know that in before the beginning
[43:34] of
[43:34] the earth or before the inhabitants of
[43:37] the earth
[43:38] that there was a battle and that battle
[43:40] started in the heavens
[43:42] we can see in revelation 12 that that
[43:45] the battle is also
[43:47] in the heavens so there is a
[43:50] disturbance that is going on in the
[43:53] heavenly realms
[43:55] as um as there is a bride that is about
[43:59] to take her position
[44:00] there and as she goes to take her
[44:04] position
[44:05] of course there is a fierce and furious
[44:08] battle that takes place between
[44:11] um michael the archangel and and lucifer
[44:16] and um so this but this battle has been
[44:19] a long
[44:20] uh ongoing battle and there have been
[44:23] many many
[44:25] wars and skirmishes that have been
[44:27] fought
[44:28] and um and so yet we're here in the time
[44:32] where
[44:33] there's going to be an end to this
[44:36] battle
[44:37] amen where that there there will be a
[44:40] a total victory and a total
[44:43] deliverance and um so the battle it
[44:47] started on heaven it continued upon the
[44:49] earth because
[44:50] the bible said that his tale drew the
[44:52] third part of the stars of heaven
[44:55] and it cast him the earth now brother
[44:57] branham did a play of words on this in
[44:58] one of his sermons he said
[45:00] it wasn't so much his tale but you know
[45:03] the t-a-i-l
[45:05] but but the t-a-l-e that he told
[45:09] and and it was the lie of the devil that
[45:11] caused the fall
[45:13] of angels and then it would cause
[45:16] the fall of man now so
[45:19] he would by the la the
[45:22] the the lie deceive angels and by
[45:26] the lie he would also deceive
[45:29] man now paul tells us of his ambition
[45:33] and and that satan will accomplish
[45:36] a large part of his ambition if you look
[45:39] with me in ii thessalonians 2
[45:42] and verse 3 and they were questioning
[45:44] paul about the day of the lord and about
[45:47] the coming of the lord
[45:49] and and so he told them he said now let
[45:52] no man deceive you by any means for that
[45:54] day
[45:54] shall not come except there cometh
[45:57] falling away
[45:58] first so he said there's even to come a
[46:01] falling away
[46:03] and and he said then that man of sin
[46:05] will be revealed
[46:06] the son of perdition now now don't just
[46:08] think of a falling away at the end time
[46:11] we we see that there has been a fallen
[46:14] away
[46:15] ever since the first age
[46:18] and so there there has been a falling
[46:21] away until the woman
[46:23] that began there in the book of acts
[46:26] winds up being the of the book of
[46:29] revelation
[46:31] so you you can see that um there was a
[46:34] fall in the way the church continued to
[46:36] fall
[46:37] until out there that she was
[46:40] irredeemable and god would have to call
[46:43] out a people out of every kindred tongue
[46:45] and tribe and nation
[46:47] he would actually by his word have to
[46:50] create himself a bride
[46:52] now so he said um in verse four he said
[46:55] he opposes
[46:56] and exalted his heaven but what's these
[46:59] words he
[47:00] exalts his self above all that is called
[47:03] god
[47:04] or or that is worshipped and
[47:08] and so that he sitteth as
[47:12] he as god sitteth in the temple of god
[47:15] now he's not
[47:16] doing this as satan notice he is doing
[47:19] this
[47:20] masquerading himself as
[47:23] god sitting in the temple of god
[47:27] and he is trying to prove or show or
[47:30] convincing others that he indeed is god
[47:34] so you see it's a great deception
[47:38] that the world ends in a time of
[47:41] an age of terrible terrible deception
[47:44] where
[47:45] satan himself sits in the very church of
[47:48] god
[47:49] and convinces people that he is god
[47:52] and and so he is worshiped and he does
[47:56] this by opposing
[47:58] and exalting so if you notice this word
[48:01] opposing it
[48:02] it is a is a battle that is going on and
[48:05] and
[48:06] and his whole purpose is to exalt
[48:09] himself now he says i will be worshiped
[48:13] in other words i will have preeminence
[48:17] so the the battle between god and satan
[48:20] is
[48:21] over who will have preeminence and i
[48:23] want you to notice
[48:24] that god also says he will have
[48:27] preeminence
[48:28] in colossians 1 and verse 18 and he
[48:31] christ is the head of the body the
[48:34] church
[48:35] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[48:37] the dead
[48:38] that in all things he might
[48:41] have the preeminence so you have
[48:44] two now that are saying two opposing
[48:48] forces
[48:49] that are desiring preeminence
[48:52] amen now what caused the fall of lucifer
[48:56] in heaven satan desired
[48:58] to have preeminence over angels and
[49:01] and then of course he fell and the
[49:04] angels
[49:05] that that he deceived were cast out with
[49:07] him
[49:08] and he come to earth to gain them
[49:10] preeminence
[49:11] over the sons of god and he wanted
[49:15] lordship over man and thus
[49:18] have lordship over the earth now
[49:21] remember
[49:22] everyone unless unless you are born
[49:24] again
[49:25] by the holy spirit of god satan has
[49:28] lordship over you amen there are two
[49:32] lords satan is the lord of some and that
[49:34] and jesus christ is the lord of others
[49:37] there's your true two lords amen but the
[49:39] born again
[49:40] jesus christ is lord he is a ruler he
[49:44] has supremacy he has preeminence
[49:47] for the unborn again satan has
[49:49] preeminence
[49:51] now so what was of all of of that
[49:54] happened in the garden it was when
[49:56] the lie of the devil the word of satan
[50:00] was taken and given preeminence over
[50:03] god's word
[50:04] which gave satan lordship
[50:08] now so satan came to the weaker vessel
[50:11] which was eve
[50:13] and eve chose to give the word of the
[50:16] serpent
[50:17] preeminence over the word of god
[50:21] now this is this is what happened in the
[50:24] garden
[50:25] and of course this is a very type of
[50:27] what happens to the church
[50:29] as you see in ii thessalonians
[50:32] that that the church gives preeminence
[50:34] to satan
[50:36] and he sits there in the temple of god
[50:40] worshiped as god now so now
[50:43] we know what happened satan used a
[50:45] serpent to get headship or preeminence
[50:48] over eve and by doing so
[50:49] he got headship over adam and he took
[50:52] position over the sons of god
[50:55] now preeminence preeminence you know is
[50:58] something that's very
[50:59] important in the marriage vow
[51:02] we pledge to forsake all others
[51:05] is that right and be true to our mate
[51:08] until
[51:09] death do us part and so that means your
[51:12] spouse is to have
[51:14] preeminence over any other person or be
[51:17] first place in your life of course with
[51:20] god being
[51:21] preeminent overall but now
[51:24] the woman typing the bride is to be
[51:27] subject
[51:28] to her husband and of course the husband
[51:30] is to be
[51:31] subject to christ now but because of sin
[51:36] now when because of what the fall in the
[51:39] garden
[51:39] all of us were born wrong we have to be
[51:43] born again and we that's this is why
[51:46] jesus first doctrine came he said you
[51:49] might be an israelite
[51:51] you might be natural seed of abraham but
[51:54] you
[51:54] gotta have a new birth you were born
[51:57] wrong
[51:58] no matter what race you come in no
[52:00] matter how
[52:01] chosen a race you got to be born again
[52:05] you must be born again
[52:08] and now because of sin we were
[52:11] born dead to god
[52:15] and we were alive to sin
[52:18] now see if you look with me on ephesians
[52:21] 2 and 1
[52:22] and it says and you as he quickened so
[52:25] he made us alive because we were dead
[52:29] in trespasses and sin we were born
[52:33] dead we required to be birthed
[52:36] into another life and that's the only
[52:40] way that that
[52:40] that new life can ever become known to
[52:43] you is
[52:44] by a new birth a personal experience
[52:47] with god himself
[52:49] where in time past you walked according
[52:51] to the course of this world
[52:53] according to the prince of the power
[52:57] of the air now notice satan has
[53:00] power in the atmospheres
[53:03] he the atmosphere of your life then
[53:06] would become
[53:07] darkened and clouded with unbelief
[53:10] within and it would permeate your nature
[53:14] and you would walk according to the
[53:16] course of this world
[53:18] because you know because of the spirit
[53:21] that now worketh
[53:22] in the children of the disobedience
[53:26] now among whom we all add our
[53:29] conversation that means our
[53:30] conduct in times past in the lust of our
[53:34] flesh
[53:35] notice we we all we all were born this
[53:38] way
[53:39] there was none of us born sinless we
[53:42] everyone needed redeemed
[53:44] we were everyone born in sin shape and
[53:47] iniquity as brother branham would jam
[53:49] these scriptures together and come in
[53:50] this world
[53:51] speaking lies this was our condition
[53:54] this was where we are
[53:56] amen now so therefore we all had
[53:59] our times past in the lusts of our flesh
[54:03] fulfilling the desires of our flesh and
[54:06] of the mind
[54:07] and where by nature
[54:10] by the atmospheres that ruled over
[54:13] us and that that atmosphere
[54:17] made us who we were and that we were the
[54:21] children of wrath even
[54:24] as others amen this is who we were
[54:27] by our first birth this is what sin
[54:31] birthed us into but god
[54:34] aren't you glad for that but god who is
[54:38] rich in mercy for his love wherewith
[54:41] he loved us remember we were
[54:44] his first this is very
[54:47] important we were his first he had a
[54:51] claim on us
[54:52] first we were in his book first
[54:55] amen we belong to him first
[54:59] we never originally belonged to the
[55:01] devil
[55:02] so he came looking for his own because
[55:05] his great
[55:06] love wherewith he loved us
[55:09] even when we were dead in sins
[55:13] not by our own choice but by our birth
[55:15] into sinful life
[55:17] but he has made us alive now or
[55:21] quickened us or brought us into another
[55:24] realm or atmosphere a man of heaven's
[55:28] atmosphere
[55:30] and raised us up or made us alive
[55:32] together with christ by
[55:34] grace are you saved and that raises up
[55:37] together
[55:37] or gave us entrance into and made us to
[55:41] sit together
[55:42] to rule in heavenly places in christ
[55:46] jesus
[55:47] so here is the believer's position he is
[55:49] to rule
[55:51] with christ whatever she defeated
[55:54] you're to rule over that defeated thing
[55:58] amen sin was defeated sickness was
[56:01] defeated
[56:02] even death was defeated yes all right
[56:05] so his grace gives us a seed of dominion
[56:09] enthroned with christ over the desires
[56:12] and the lust
[56:13] of the flesh and the mind changing our
[56:17] atmospheres of our being from sin with
[56:20] its doubt and
[56:21] with its unbelief now now we're
[56:24] we're here in this end time and we see
[56:27] the patterns down to the ages
[56:30] and we come down and we we can look back
[56:33] and we can
[56:34] type ourselves and see us back in the
[56:36] bible
[56:37] and see israel god would use her as a
[56:40] type
[56:41] and and he would reflect himself through
[56:43] all of these characters down to the
[56:45] bible
[56:46] and we come to the end time and you know
[56:49] right at the same time
[56:51] that an angel of god maybe not on the
[56:53] same day maybe not
[56:54] exactly the same years but whenever it
[56:57] was however it was
[56:58] in the same age right about the same
[57:01] time
[57:03] are you with me you have the the rise of
[57:06] powers united nations coming forth
[57:08] world council and churches are coming
[57:10] forth
[57:12] right all of these are are coming forth
[57:14] with power
[57:15] and then right in there an angel comes
[57:18] to profit
[57:20] amen right at the same time that he is
[57:23] revealing himself to a prophet he you
[57:26] know israel
[57:27] is raising up and people are gathered
[57:30] back to their homeland
[57:32] what is it it's reflecting something
[57:34] that is happening
[57:36] in the in the realm of the world there's
[57:39] a turmoil
[57:40] that is going on there's a uniting of
[57:43] time and signs there's uniting of people
[57:46] together some against god's word some to
[57:48] fulfill god's word
[57:50] and so there's a whole battle that sets
[57:53] it away
[57:54] as good versus evil comes together and
[57:58] and the fight is begins to happen in the
[58:00] spiritual realm
[58:02] and and and so it it comes and it
[58:06] manifests itself also in the physical
[58:09] realm
[58:10] now notice as we see this israel
[58:13] is always a type of the the church of
[58:16] the bride
[58:17] she is always a type of her but she is a
[58:21] physical entity where the bride is a
[58:24] spiritual
[58:25] entity and and so right now we are
[58:29] seeing
[58:29] in recent days another physical fight
[58:33] over the land of israel and we wonder
[58:36] what is this all about
[58:38] why is there a struggle well because
[58:40] heaven is disturbed
[58:43] you know there there are lights in the
[58:45] skies
[58:46] or um unidentified objects that are
[58:49] there there's investigating angels
[58:52] that are coming in there there's a
[58:54] turmoil
[58:55] in the heavens there's turmoils upon the
[58:58] earth
[58:59] there is every kind of spirit rising up
[59:02] wanting preeminence amen you you have
[59:05] the white
[59:06] wanting their supremacy and the black
[59:08] one and their supremacy and the asians
[59:10] wanting their
[59:11] supremacy and russia wants to control
[59:13] the world the united states wants to
[59:15] control it and and china wants to
[59:18] control it
[59:19] and everybody is wanting preeminence
[59:24] and so in the land thereof israel
[59:27] there are two people that are fighting
[59:29] for the preeminence
[59:32] now the the preeminence to be supreme to
[59:37] be first
[59:40] now the people of israel
[59:43] we know are the original owners
[59:47] and remember going back in our own
[59:50] thought of us
[59:51] the bride the the the mankind he
[59:54] first had preeminence before satan did
[59:59] and we were his before satan ever got a
[1:00:02] hold of us
[1:00:05] and we look here at this land of israel
[1:00:08] and we
[1:00:08] see again the people of israel are the
[1:00:11] original owners
[1:00:14] of the land and they were given by it
[1:00:17] was given by god to possess this land
[1:00:20] but we have others today that want to
[1:00:22] take preeminence
[1:00:24] and to establish themselves as the
[1:00:26] possessors
[1:00:27] of the promised land now you look at
[1:00:30] history the book proves it
[1:00:32] the dead sea scrolls reveal that of
[1:00:36] israel's
[1:00:36] ownership and their first claim to the
[1:00:39] land
[1:00:40] that they were actually there that
[1:00:43] that's
[1:00:43] where they were from this is my land and
[1:00:46] we predate
[1:00:47] our ownership was before all others
[1:00:51] now we we look at the history and the
[1:00:54] and
[1:00:54] the book as we said proves it and and
[1:00:57] you
[1:00:58] you know as i spoke last sunday the
[1:01:00] israelites controlled jerusalem
[1:01:03] 1500 years before the romans came
[1:01:06] rome controlled jerusalem nearly 530
[1:01:09] years and
[1:01:10] the muslims did took control for 500
[1:01:13] years and then there was a great
[1:01:14] tug of war between the muslims and
[1:01:18] the catholics um the catholic crusaders
[1:01:21] against
[1:01:22] the muslims for the next 150 years and
[1:01:25] it would go back and forth the control
[1:01:27] over
[1:01:27] as they fought and then the muslim turks
[1:01:29] controlled it for the next
[1:01:31] 650 years until the british in
[1:01:34] him expanded their empire and they
[1:01:37] gained control for
[1:01:39] 30 years and now through the miraculous
[1:01:43] hand of god who was present in
[1:01:46] their battles the israelites are now
[1:01:49] back in their homeland now for the past
[1:01:52] 70-plus years amen i want you to get it
[1:01:56] it was
[1:01:57] right about the same time that god
[1:02:00] determined that her pride would go back
[1:02:03] to her homeland
[1:02:05] amen it would be with signs and wonders
[1:02:08] and the tear down of satan's kingdom
[1:02:11] and advancing in scriptures that had
[1:02:14] and promises of the word of god that
[1:02:18] had not been achieved in thousands of
[1:02:20] years
[1:02:22] now we we look at some the miraculous
[1:02:25] hands of god now
[1:02:27] let's just see what all this struggle is
[1:02:29] about now abraham had two
[1:02:31] sons but only one that god recognized
[1:02:35] is that right this struggle began
[1:02:38] between these people back in genesis
[1:02:41] it's a
[1:02:42] long struggle and
[1:02:45] genesis 21 tells you about the child
[1:02:48] having grown which is isaac having grown
[1:02:51] and was weaned and
[1:02:52] and there um ishmael
[1:02:55] um began to came and began to mock
[1:02:59] the child and and uh sarah saw it and
[1:03:02] she said
[1:03:03] cast out this bonds woman and her son
[1:03:07] for the son of this bonds woman will
[1:03:10] not be heir with my son
[1:03:14] even isaac and of course the thing
[1:03:17] displeased
[1:03:18] abraham and and god said to him
[1:03:21] said don't let this displease you
[1:03:23] because of the
[1:03:25] bob's woman said listen to her voice
[1:03:29] for in isaac shall thy seed be called
[1:03:33] now let's look at these two children one
[1:03:35] of them was the result
[1:03:37] of the weakness of sarah's faith
[1:03:41] amen the other was the result
[1:03:44] of the miraculous power of god when the
[1:03:47] faith came
[1:03:50] is that right so one is a child of faith
[1:03:52] the other is a child of doubt
[1:03:55] now again these are the two sons the
[1:03:58] ones that doubt one's faith there's a
[1:04:01] war
[1:04:01] between faith and doubt there's a war
[1:04:05] between
[1:04:06] the the offsprings now look they're in
[1:04:09] the same movement they're
[1:04:10] right you know right here as as in this
[1:04:13] case the seed of abraham
[1:04:15] one a child of doubt one child of the
[1:04:17] bonds woman the slave woman
[1:04:19] the other the child of the free and they
[1:04:22] will not
[1:04:23] be air together now
[1:04:26] so he said take thy son thine only son
[1:04:30] when god referred to isaac
[1:04:31] he referred to him as the only son i
[1:04:35] don't recognize the child of the bonds
[1:04:37] woman
[1:04:38] i only recognize the child of the three
[1:04:42] woman
[1:04:43] and they're not ours together but they
[1:04:47] but and i don't i don't receive the one
[1:04:50] i reject the one i accept the other as
[1:04:53] the one
[1:04:54] of the promise now so he is the one that
[1:04:57] was to inherit now that's
[1:04:59] the struggle today the child of the
[1:05:02] bombs woman
[1:05:03] the ismailites are wanting to have
[1:05:06] preeminence
[1:05:07] over the child of the free woman
[1:05:10] so when you hear of the palestinians
[1:05:12] laying claim to the land and the city
[1:05:15] the muslims are the ishmaelites the
[1:05:17] children of the bombs woman and the
[1:05:19] natural
[1:05:20] and here these two natural seeds are
[1:05:22] right there at the end time
[1:05:25] and they're fighting right over the same
[1:05:27] place
[1:05:31] right amen and this one is trying to
[1:05:34] claim one of them is claiming that
[1:05:37] you know the bonds woman child it was
[1:05:39] ishmael that abraham offered
[1:05:42] and and here the jews are laying to the
[1:05:45] rightful claim
[1:05:46] it was isaac and this is our land and
[1:05:50] this is our place
[1:05:52] and god had declared they'll not be heir
[1:05:54] together
[1:05:57] amen now now paul said that the bonds
[1:06:01] woman will not be heir with the children
[1:06:03] of the free woman
[1:06:04] he re-emphasizes that in the book of
[1:06:06] galatians
[1:06:07] now in the spiritual there is also
[1:06:11] as they type there is a
[1:06:14] a child of the bun's woman and a child
[1:06:17] of the free woman now
[1:06:19] let's talk about this in the spiritual
[1:06:21] that's the catholic
[1:06:23] and protestant denominations
[1:06:26] every denomination is a child
[1:06:29] of the slave woman
[1:06:32] they're in bondage under denominational
[1:06:35] rule
[1:06:37] amen and they lay claim now look they
[1:06:41] all of them are laying claim to the
[1:06:42] place that god chose his name
[1:06:44] to put his name in other words that they
[1:06:47] own
[1:06:48] jerusalem are the place of worship
[1:06:50] you've got to come here to be saved
[1:06:54] right amen but now there is also a bride
[1:06:58] and she's few in number in comparison
[1:07:02] like the muslims are millions and the
[1:07:04] jews are few
[1:07:05] and man you've got a few in the bride
[1:07:08] and millions of
[1:07:09] upon billions now of christianity and
[1:07:14] they're all
[1:07:14] claiming the promised land they're all
[1:07:16] claiming the rapture
[1:07:17] they're all claiming the inheritance
[1:07:20] they're all claiming
[1:07:22] that they are the rightful heir
[1:07:26] that they can take the bible and and put
[1:07:28] any kind of interpretation they want to
[1:07:31] [Music]
[1:07:32] and change the borders of the land of
[1:07:34] any whim that they have
[1:07:37] come on now amen but but i just want you
[1:07:40] to understand
[1:07:41] that the muslims are not the people of
[1:07:43] the book
[1:07:44] neither is any denomination the people
[1:07:47] of the book
[1:07:48] they are squatters on the land
[1:07:54] now it is not a muslim land
[1:07:59] first of all muhammad never visited
[1:08:01] jerusalem
[1:08:03] and and secondly islam didn't arrive
[1:08:06] there
[1:08:07] um it was 2 000 years when they aro
[1:08:10] arrived after joshua had established the
[1:08:13] nation of israel
[1:08:14] sixteen hundred years before the muslims
[1:08:16] came in
[1:08:17] david made jerusalem the capital of
[1:08:20] israel
[1:08:21] even christianity was founded there 600
[1:08:24] years before
[1:08:26] the muslims came and and the
[1:08:29] the islamic dome of the rock where islam
[1:08:32] laid claim to that holy place
[1:08:34] was built 654 years
[1:08:37] after jesus died at calvary
[1:08:40] so the jewish temple was there long
[1:08:43] before the islamic dome of the rock
[1:08:45] laid claim to it now
[1:08:48] as we're looking at this remember now
[1:08:51] jerusalem
[1:08:52] we went through it last week was the
[1:08:54] place that god
[1:08:55] chose to put his name it said first
[1:08:58] kings 11 36
[1:09:00] jerusalem the city which i've chosen me
[1:09:02] to put my name
[1:09:05] and and it was also there where the
[1:09:08] blood
[1:09:09] where blood was accepted to take away
[1:09:12] sin right and it had to be
[1:09:16] in jerusalem now the bible tells you
[1:09:19] that the meeting place
[1:09:20] where god will meet you is where the
[1:09:23] blood is
[1:09:24] and it's where he chose to put his name
[1:09:27] if you put a look with me at hebrews 9
[1:09:30] 22
[1:09:31] and almost all things are by the law
[1:09:33] purged by blood
[1:09:34] and without shedding of blood there
[1:09:38] is no remission so sin
[1:09:41] can only be remitted by blood
[1:09:45] now let's just look at this as we look
[1:09:48] at the religions of the world today
[1:09:50] and i just want to name them even
[1:09:52] judaism
[1:09:54] is now a bloodless religion even with
[1:09:57] animal sacrifices
[1:09:58] they don't shed blood their bloodless
[1:10:01] religion
[1:10:02] when you look at islam there are bloody
[1:10:06] people all right
[1:10:07] murderers and so on but it's a bloodless
[1:10:10] religion
[1:10:11] amen they don't have blood in their
[1:10:13] sacrifice
[1:10:14] now let me just get a little closer as
[1:10:17] we look
[1:10:18] at this modern christianity is now a
[1:10:21] bloodless religion
[1:10:24] now like cain they're dependent on a
[1:10:26] beautiful altar
[1:10:28] uh upon which they present the works of
[1:10:31] their hands
[1:10:32] the fruit of their labor remember
[1:10:36] they're just like cain in the bible the
[1:10:38] the seed of the serpent is that right
[1:10:41] they're
[1:10:41] offering the fruit of their labors they
[1:10:44] sing about the blood
[1:10:45] they talk about the blood but they have
[1:10:48] no blood
[1:10:50] all their blood is historical
[1:10:55] amen i mean every bit of it is
[1:10:58] historical
[1:10:59] the but the blood let me just say
[1:11:02] the blood is not to be a historical
[1:11:06] substance that dried up on the ground
[1:11:09] or that stained the cross
[1:11:15] and let's just talk about it for a
[1:11:16] moment not only is it not
[1:11:18] hysterical or historical but but the
[1:11:21] blood of jesus was not
[1:11:23] human blood either
[1:11:27] amen it was not human blood
[1:11:31] now this is what brother branham told us
[1:11:33] to show us the father and he'll satisfy
[1:11:35] us
[1:11:36] which is one of the sermons i just
[1:11:38] listened to he said have you
[1:11:39] one this tune is three in this
[1:11:41] foreigners whatever you are we'll just
[1:11:43] get this in your mind right now
[1:11:45] you shake hands and you shake hands and
[1:11:47] say we're brothers look
[1:11:48] god was in christ reconciling the world
[1:11:51] to himself
[1:11:53] jesus was the son of god that god
[1:11:55] overshadowed mary
[1:11:56] and created in the womb a blood cell
[1:12:00] we couldn't you've heard people say we
[1:12:03] were saved by jewish blood
[1:12:06] we could not be saved by jewish blood
[1:12:10] it was just as sinful as any other blood
[1:12:14] we were we were saved by the blood of
[1:12:16] the gentiles
[1:12:17] no sir we wasn't even saved by human
[1:12:20] blood
[1:12:21] we were saved by the blood of god
[1:12:25] god's blood the germ life comes from the
[1:12:27] blood cell
[1:12:29] and the blood cell here came from god
[1:12:31] the creator
[1:12:32] who created a blood cell that brought
[1:12:34] forth the son of god
[1:12:37] now there at calvary the blood cell was
[1:12:41] broke open and the spirit of god living
[1:12:43] in that cell
[1:12:45] it came back on the day of pentecost
[1:12:48] in the form of the holy ghost
[1:12:52] in other words the life of the blood
[1:12:55] now in the blood is life and the life of
[1:12:58] the blood was poured out
[1:13:00] on the day of pentecost as the spirit
[1:13:03] fell upon the 120 these
[1:13:06] men and women women were not born of man
[1:13:10] nor of the will of flesh but they were
[1:13:12] born of
[1:13:13] god can i say it they were born of the
[1:13:16] blood of god
[1:13:17] if you ever receive the baptism of the
[1:13:20] holy ghost
[1:13:21] you have been birthed by the blood of
[1:13:23] jesus christ
[1:13:25] amen the life of god the spirit that was
[1:13:29] in the blood now so we're born of god
[1:13:32] thus the bride
[1:13:33] is the blood by the spirit
[1:13:37] now you know some of the early message
[1:13:39] movements
[1:13:40] um early on the persian movement came
[1:13:43] out that they were now
[1:13:44] offering cain's sacrifice
[1:13:47] and and of course to offer cain's
[1:13:50] sacrifices a bloodless sacrifice
[1:13:53] it's offering fruits of your hands
[1:13:56] it's offering your works and that
[1:14:00] movement is a is a bloodless cult
[1:14:03] amen now you know the reasons for you
[1:14:06] know the reasons
[1:14:08] the reason because denominations like
[1:14:11] cults
[1:14:12] every denomination's spirit makes a cult
[1:14:17] amen now brother branham said that
[1:14:19] there's
[1:14:20] no one ever known of god but what
[1:14:23] long to see god and there's just
[1:14:25] something in the human heart that calls
[1:14:26] out to see god
[1:14:27] and i've often made that statement every
[1:14:30] cult
[1:14:30] that ever raised in the world are
[1:14:33] nothing in the world but
[1:14:34] hungry children seeking bread and if the
[1:14:37] preacher doesn't give them the bread of
[1:14:39] life
[1:14:40] the devil will give him a garbage can
[1:14:43] to eat out of so we want to we got to
[1:14:47] give them
[1:14:47] the bread of life the word of god
[1:14:51] now let me just be clear the blood today
[1:14:54] is not some red substance
[1:14:59] it is not some element that is that is
[1:15:01] contains
[1:15:02] plasma it is the life
[1:15:05] of the blood the baptism of the holy
[1:15:10] ghost and that is the only blood
[1:15:13] that will save you is the life
[1:15:16] of jesus christ that was released from
[1:15:20] the blood cell
[1:15:21] there at calvary that came back on the
[1:15:23] day of pentecost
[1:15:25] when jesus offered his blood there in
[1:15:28] the heavens as a high priest
[1:15:30] and sent back his life back to the earth
[1:15:33] men and women were born of the blood of
[1:15:35] god
[1:15:37] are you with me now so you see
[1:15:40] even now men don't want the blood life
[1:15:43] of god
[1:15:44] and satan does everything that he can do
[1:15:47] to keep the church away from the blood
[1:15:51] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:15:53] the blood life of god
[1:15:56] unless you have the holy spirit you have
[1:15:58] no blood
[1:16:00] amen that is his life
[1:16:03] amen that is that is the the
[1:16:06] the germ of god his life the holy spirit
[1:16:10] of god
[1:16:11] and you've got to be born of the holy
[1:16:13] ghost
[1:16:14] he's got to have preeminence in your
[1:16:16] life
[1:16:18] and every place of worship there must be
[1:16:22] the outpouring and the of the blood of
[1:16:26] jesus christ
[1:16:27] where that blood the holy spirit washes
[1:16:30] away
[1:16:30] sin washes away unbelief
[1:16:34] sets your faith back on truth again
[1:16:38] amen that's why you know he must have
[1:16:40] the preeminence
[1:16:42] now of course in the indictment brother
[1:16:45] branham would say
[1:16:46] why did they say all men should worship
[1:16:48] at jerusalem notice
[1:16:49] all of these are one in jerusalem let me
[1:16:51] just say it's not just
[1:16:53] the muslims that wants jerusalem the
[1:16:56] catholics have got their
[1:16:57] churches there and they want jerusalem
[1:17:02] all of these are fighting over the same
[1:17:05] place there's a war
[1:17:06] over this place now remember
[1:17:09] symbolically
[1:17:10] it is typing something that is greater
[1:17:13] greater
[1:17:13] and that is that all men are wanting to
[1:17:16] be the way
[1:17:18] the truth the life they're wanting to
[1:17:20] have preeminence over all
[1:17:24] are you with me now notice brother
[1:17:26] branham said why did they say all men
[1:17:28] should worship at jerusalem as
[1:17:30] there's only one place that god will
[1:17:31] fellowship with a man
[1:17:33] and that is under the blood of the
[1:17:35] sacrifice
[1:17:36] and that's the reason they had to come
[1:17:38] to jerusalem
[1:17:39] god will never meet with man nowhere
[1:17:42] else but
[1:17:43] under the blood that's why the
[1:17:46] main thing that we must seek out is the
[1:17:49] holy spirit of god
[1:17:51] being filled with the spirit every song
[1:17:54] filled with the spirit ever all our
[1:17:56] worship
[1:17:57] mixed with blood the spirit of god
[1:18:00] getting over the people
[1:18:01] responding back to the word of god in
[1:18:04] the spirit
[1:18:05] it's got to be spirit worship
[1:18:09] are you with me because god will never
[1:18:11] meet
[1:18:12] with man nowhere else but under the
[1:18:15] blood
[1:18:16] and when you turn the blood down when
[1:18:18] you turn the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:18:21] down
[1:18:21] then your meeting place with god has
[1:18:24] been taken away let me say if you just
[1:18:27] turn it into a mere confession of faith
[1:18:30] if you just take it into um
[1:18:33] into joining a church or being a part of
[1:18:37] a message group
[1:18:39] amman anything like that your meeting
[1:18:41] place with god
[1:18:43] is only under the blood that's why we
[1:18:46] must have the holy spirit
[1:18:48] in every service amen the ministry must
[1:18:51] be anointed by the holy ghost
[1:18:54] there's got to be blood all over it
[1:18:58] remember we are eagles and eagles eat
[1:19:01] live meat
[1:19:02] and man they're rippers of the beach and
[1:19:04] they take that fresh meat
[1:19:06] and the blood flows and it gets all over
[1:19:09] the eagle
[1:19:11] it sprays out over him and i'll tell you
[1:19:14] if you come to
[1:19:15] church and your dog and you don't
[1:19:18] get the blood all over you if you don't
[1:19:21] get the holy ghost
[1:19:22] all over you you are either eating on
[1:19:24] dead carcass
[1:19:26] around that is maggot bread and
[1:19:28] everything else or either that
[1:19:30] you you are not eating at all but i'll
[1:19:33] tell you if you're an eagle
[1:19:34] we're the carcass of the word is and the
[1:19:37] christ killed me to the word is
[1:19:39] the eagles would gather together there
[1:19:41] and when they do they're the rippers of
[1:19:43] the beast
[1:19:44] they carry into that word and the blood
[1:19:46] flow
[1:19:47] i'm glad to begin the worst of god and
[1:19:49] the blood flows
[1:19:50] amen the blood flows and the blood flows
[1:19:53] and it heals sickness
[1:19:55] and it removes sin and it takes away
[1:19:57] unbelief
[1:19:58] because the blood is flowing
[1:20:07] now bear in mind the blood
[1:20:11] is the holy spirit and that's the only
[1:20:15] place he meets with man today
[1:20:18] is under the shed blood of the sacrifice
[1:20:20] and brother see i don't care
[1:20:22] if you're a methodist baptist
[1:20:24] presbyterian
[1:20:26] or a roman catholic or whatever you
[1:20:28] might be
[1:20:29] will come under the shed blood
[1:20:32] god will meet both of us there in other
[1:20:35] words get the holy ghost and god to meet
[1:20:37] you there
[1:20:39] amen and that's where we can all meet in
[1:20:41] fellowship on the same grounds
[1:20:43] because he will not meet just because
[1:20:45] you're methodist
[1:20:47] he won't meet because you peruse your
[1:20:49] seven thunder
[1:20:50] or even mainstream or whatever title you
[1:20:52] want to give your
[1:20:53] your little group per click amen he
[1:20:56] won't meet you because you belong to
[1:20:58] evening light tabernacle
[1:21:00] and that you were born on a church pew
[1:21:02] that's not where you
[1:21:03] why he will meet you he'll meet you
[1:21:05] under one condition
[1:21:07] that's under the blood amen when you get
[1:21:10] the blood the holy ghost begin to move
[1:21:13] and there's where god will meet you
[1:21:15] that's where man and god comes together
[1:21:18] is under the blood now
[1:21:21] so the blood is always before him he can
[1:21:23] only see you through that shed blood
[1:21:25] and i'll tell you what if outside of
[1:21:28] that blood
[1:21:28] you're still a sinner you're still
[1:21:31] guilty
[1:21:33] amen only under that blood does he look
[1:21:36] through that blood and he sees you
[1:21:38] white as snow now he said that's the
[1:21:42] reason
[1:21:43] you don't see things happening in the
[1:21:45] churches
[1:21:46] they confess to believe the blood
[1:21:49] but they reject the very plan to get the
[1:21:52] blood
[1:21:52] the word now where what is it in the
[1:21:56] word where do we get the blood the
[1:21:57] spirit
[1:21:58] what word is it here's the word here's
[1:22:01] the plan
[1:22:02] to get the blood repent turn
[1:22:05] from your sins give god preeminence
[1:22:09] let it be lord over all and my people
[1:22:12] want to be a christian and won't
[1:22:14] give him lordship over their temper
[1:22:17] we'll give them
[1:22:18] come on now they won't give them the
[1:22:20] lordship over
[1:22:21] their lusts they want to keep their sins
[1:22:24] and still worship that on the side i
[1:22:26] want you to know this is a marriage
[1:22:28] he must be above all others he must have
[1:22:31] preeminence
[1:22:32] there's no room for any other person
[1:22:35] amen to any other spirit
[1:22:37] but him he must have pre-evidence
[1:22:47] the reason you don't see things
[1:22:48] happening in the churches
[1:22:50] they confess to believe the blood but
[1:22:52] they reject the very plan to get the
[1:22:54] blood the word
[1:22:55] and the word the word that gives you the
[1:22:58] plan
[1:22:59] to get to the blood is repent turn from
[1:23:03] your sins
[1:23:04] give god preeminence and be baptized in
[1:23:07] the name of jesus christ
[1:23:09] and you shall receive the blood or be
[1:23:12] born of it
[1:23:14] hallelujah amen now this is very
[1:23:17] very very vital and important that he
[1:23:19] have the preeminence
[1:23:20] let me just go over it again you know
[1:23:23] you cannot
[1:23:24] get the holy ghost without first giving
[1:23:27] him preeminence
[1:23:30] he won't dwell with you and somebody
[1:23:32] else there can
[1:23:34] be no other lovers but him
[1:23:38] there's no room in this marriage for
[1:23:40] anybody else
[1:23:43] come on your selfishness your pride your
[1:23:46] own ambitions
[1:23:48] your own desires he must be
[1:23:51] above all others this is why people go
[1:23:55] for years without giving the holy ghost
[1:23:57] is because
[1:23:58] they don't give him preeminence
[1:24:08] so well we don't need altar called
[1:24:10] brother altar calls them for that very
[1:24:12] purpose
[1:24:13] where you die out to your very sins
[1:24:16] to your unbelief amen will you come and
[1:24:19] give him preeminence
[1:24:22] now he said there he said there's only
[1:24:25] one place that god
[1:24:26] will honor that word you'll never honor
[1:24:28] it come say i'm a roman catholic
[1:24:30] i demand this to be done you can't do it
[1:24:32] methodist baptist pentecostals you can't
[1:24:35] do it let me just say
[1:24:36] message believer whatever you are
[1:24:40] amen the only way you can do it is under
[1:24:42] the mercies of god
[1:24:44] through his grace has come through the
[1:24:45] shed blood of jesus christ
[1:24:47] and say lord i claim the promise
[1:24:52] and then if you're really under the
[1:24:54] blood if you're really born again
[1:24:56] god's obligated to that word but first
[1:24:58] you've got to be under the blood
[1:25:00] you see it now no wonder they can't
[1:25:03] believe in miracles
[1:25:04] i'm quoting your prophet this is why
[1:25:07] they're not under the blood
[1:25:09] no wonder you can't believe in the
[1:25:11] supernatural you say well brother tim we
[1:25:13] believe it but it just don't work here
[1:25:15] then you don't believe it amen the
[1:25:18] supernatural won't work where people
[1:25:20] believe
[1:25:22] the reason they condemned it back there
[1:25:24] is the same reason they condemn it today
[1:25:26] they're guilty as guilty can be
[1:25:28] cause only under this shed blood and
[1:25:30] those who would dare
[1:25:32] dare some little brother who dares under
[1:25:35] humility to take god in his word
[1:25:37] and walk out there confessing his sin
[1:25:40] forget all these dogmas and things and
[1:25:42] stand under the blood and believe it
[1:25:44] they want to call him a fanatic or class
[1:25:46] him an oddball
[1:25:48] so now looking at this this is the only
[1:25:52] place
[1:25:54] god is going to meet you
[1:25:57] now denominations
[1:26:02] are the children of ishmael
[1:26:06] sons of hagar organizations of men
[1:26:10] they want to be the jerusalem
[1:26:16] the chosen place of worship
[1:26:19] but they can't be
[1:26:23] because they didn't believe for you
[1:26:28] as brother branham said in god's chosen
[1:26:30] place of worship can a denomination
[1:26:32] bleed
[1:26:33] you ever think of a church bleeding a
[1:26:35] denomination bleeding certainly not it
[1:26:37] taken blood to bleed from a life
[1:26:39] and that life here jesus comes into view
[1:26:42] by the lamb
[1:26:43] the lamb was a type of christ foreshadow
[1:26:45] christ because he was the lamb of god
[1:26:47] that john introduced it takes away the
[1:26:49] sin of the world
[1:26:50] we fly find jesus coming into view
[1:26:54] here in exodus 12th chapter it was only
[1:26:57] one place
[1:26:58] death could not strike when death was in
[1:27:01] the land there had to be a certain place
[1:27:04] all from under this died only one place
[1:27:07] that didn't mean it was one house
[1:27:09] but there was one place and that's where
[1:27:11] the lamb was killed
[1:27:13] where the lamb's blood was the death
[1:27:16] angel could not strike
[1:27:18] because it was one place god had put his
[1:27:22] name
[1:27:22] and that lamb was named back there in
[1:27:24] the beginning a lamb
[1:27:25] it was one place he could not strike and
[1:27:28] notice the same kind of thing today
[1:27:30] there's only one place that spiritual
[1:27:33] death
[1:27:33] cannot strike that's the word death
[1:27:36] can't strike the word because it's the
[1:27:39] living word of god but when you put
[1:27:41] creeds in it
[1:27:42] man made doctrines the word moves out to
[1:27:46] itself
[1:27:46] it'll separate like water from oil you
[1:27:49] can't mix it together
[1:27:50] therefore you see when the creed comes
[1:27:53] into denomination
[1:27:54] they all go after out they all go after
[1:27:57] the creed and the word dies out
[1:27:59] and goes on with somebody else and
[1:28:01] increases it more
[1:28:02] it picks up momentum goes on to
[1:28:04] justification sanctifiation
[1:28:06] baptism all holy ghosts and i'm out into
[1:28:08] the grain
[1:28:09] don't you see do you see the path that
[1:28:11] god has trod
[1:28:13] bringing his name all the the time right
[1:28:16] down the same
[1:28:17] because he is the word notice it can't
[1:28:19] die
[1:28:20] the word of life can't die
[1:28:23] notice how perfect the death angel was
[1:28:26] not forbidden
[1:28:27] to strike egypt's great intellectual
[1:28:30] people
[1:28:31] it wasn't forbidden to strike its sacred
[1:28:34] lands its great buildings
[1:28:36] or its pharaohs it could strike any
[1:28:39] building
[1:28:39] any place anybody but it could not
[1:28:43] strike where the lamb was
[1:28:46] now he the death angel was not forbidden
[1:28:48] to strike
[1:28:49] israel or its hebrew priest or any of
[1:28:52] their denomination
[1:28:53] all must be in god's chosen provided
[1:28:56] place
[1:28:57] or death struck church wherever you are
[1:29:00] what you belong to
[1:29:02] makes me no different but there's one
[1:29:04] thing you must know
[1:29:06] you've got to be in christ or you're
[1:29:08] dead
[1:29:09] you can't live outside of him your your
[1:29:12] church might be all right as a building
[1:29:14] your fellowship might be all right as
[1:29:16] man but when you deny the body
[1:29:19] the blood the word of jesus christ
[1:29:21] you're dead the minute you do it
[1:29:23] it's god's chosen place of worship
[1:29:26] there's where his name is exactly
[1:29:28] that's where he chose to put his name
[1:29:30] not in the church
[1:29:31] but in the son jesus christ
[1:29:34] notice the safety lies only in the place
[1:29:38] of his choosing
[1:29:39] in his lamb and in the name of the lamb
[1:29:42] notice
[1:29:42] it was a male lamb a key
[1:29:45] not a her not a church she
[1:29:48] but his name not her name but where
[1:29:52] he was going to meet his people was not
[1:29:54] in her name
[1:29:56] but in his name are you with me
[1:30:00] amen him the lamb this is really really
[1:30:03] important
[1:30:04] that we keep this it's not about her
[1:30:07] it's not about the church it's not about
[1:30:10] belonging to a group
[1:30:12] it's not about belonging to a group
[1:30:14] called evening like tabernacle
[1:30:16] it's becoming under his name
[1:30:20] amen under his blood under
[1:30:23] his life you've got to be
[1:30:26] born again of the spirit of god of the
[1:30:29] blood of god
[1:30:32] hallelujah amen amen
[1:30:35] sorry we lost you out there i'm sure but
[1:30:37] we're we're here
[1:30:39] in the congregation today amen i'll
[1:30:41] preach this to you and re-preach it
[1:30:43] again
[1:30:44] but now notice the church the great
[1:30:46] mighty church she did this and that
[1:30:48] oh she's weighed the storms with picked
[1:30:51] up in population
[1:30:52] we're great in number we're a mighty
[1:30:54] church she's a great thing
[1:30:55] but god never didn't say anything about
[1:30:57] the she
[1:30:58] he said him him is the meeting place the
[1:31:02] lamb
[1:31:03] not the church not her name but his name
[1:31:06] he didn't put her name anywhere he put
[1:31:10] his name in him
[1:31:13] amen that's why that when you're when
[1:31:15] you become
[1:31:16] his you take on his name
[1:31:19] not her name you're not a methodist or a
[1:31:22] baptist
[1:31:23] or even like tabernacles you are
[1:31:26] you are a child of the most high god and
[1:31:29] you take on his name
[1:31:31] you're identified with him you are his
[1:31:34] child
[1:31:34] you are his possession and you're there
[1:31:37] in his
[1:31:38] chosen place of worship amen that's why
[1:31:41] we are all we do in word or deed we must
[1:31:44] do it in the name of jesus christ if we
[1:31:46] pray
[1:31:47] we got to pray in the name of jesus if
[1:31:49] we ask petition
[1:31:50] we got to ask in the name jesus name if
[1:31:53] we walk we walk in jesus name if we talk
[1:31:55] we talk in jesus name
[1:31:57] if we baptize we're baptized in the name
[1:31:59] of jesus christ
[1:32:00] all we do in word of deed we do it all
[1:32:03] in that name
[1:32:05] remember again it is not about her name
[1:32:08] it's his name it is not about some
[1:32:11] preacher's name
[1:32:13] come on now he's part of the bride
[1:32:20] amen in his name there is power in his
[1:32:23] name there's redemption
[1:32:25] in his name there's forgiveness sin in
[1:32:28] his name
[1:32:29] there is healing and his name it's all
[1:32:32] about him
[1:32:33] it's all about jesus it's nothing about
[1:32:36] it's all about the
[1:32:41] [Applause]
[1:32:51] [Music]
[1:32:52] and the blood is not a literal blood but
[1:32:55] the life of the blood cell that was
[1:32:57] released at calvary came
[1:32:59] down on the day of pentecost
[1:33:03] now if you not receive the holy ghost by
[1:33:05] experience
[1:33:07] as they did on the day of pentecost
[1:33:09] you're still not under the blood
[1:33:12] let me say that again if you have not
[1:33:14] received the holy ghost by experience
[1:33:17] not by church joining not by profession
[1:33:20] of faith
[1:33:21] not by saying you believe brother
[1:33:22] martin's a prophet or jesus is lord
[1:33:24] amen but as they did on the day of
[1:33:27] pentecost you are
[1:33:28] not under the blood right amen
[1:33:32] so as we look at this let's just go a
[1:33:35] little play a little further in the
[1:33:36] indictment
[1:33:38] so we find it there then only under the
[1:33:40] blood
[1:33:41] that god met the worshipper so they met
[1:33:44] jerusalem and christ and god's provided
[1:33:47] the lamb of sacrifice amen and today
[1:33:49] there's only one place that god will
[1:33:52] meet man
[1:33:53] and that's under the blood of jesus
[1:33:55] christ
[1:33:56] anything anywhere else is condemned god
[1:33:59] will
[1:34:00] never hear amen now you might do all
[1:34:02] kinds of emotion of all kinds of isms
[1:34:05] and shake and jump
[1:34:06] and have blood and fire and smoke and
[1:34:08] everything else
[1:34:09] but as long as that life isn't compared
[1:34:12] to the word
[1:34:13] and god thoroughly identified that life
[1:34:22] [Music]
[1:34:26] [Applause]
[1:34:30] so you see the scripture we got in
[1:34:32] jerusalem the church house
[1:34:34] it's in heaven right amen and there
[1:34:37] is the jerusalem we are contending for
[1:34:40] amen
[1:34:42] yes muslims wanted over here in the
[1:34:44] middle east
[1:34:46] the jews wanted over there but that's
[1:34:48] not like jerusalem
[1:34:51] amen listen it's not our jerusalem why
[1:34:54] jerusalem is from the pub
[1:34:56] headquarters it is not jeffersonville
[1:35:10] it's not under a creed
[1:35:14] we try to make in jerusalem the method
[1:35:16] is he said we'd like to make the
[1:35:18] methodist
[1:35:18] headquarters of jerusalem the catholics
[1:35:21] would like to make wrong
[1:35:23] in the different places where we have
[1:35:25] our headquarters we'd like to make
[1:35:27] a jerusalem but the bible said our
[1:35:29] jerusalem is from above
[1:35:31] which is the mother of all beings amen
[1:35:36] [Applause]
[1:35:37] amen now when we get an eating cow you
[1:35:39] know from jeffersonville that says quit
[1:35:41] preaching and play tapes
[1:35:43] what do we do that's not jerusalem
[1:35:47] [Applause]
[1:35:49] amen that's not our jerusalem i
[1:35:52] remember jesus commissioned the
[1:35:54] disciples to preach
[1:35:56] right his last commission was go preach
[1:36:00] and all the apostles preached
[1:36:03] all the and paul when he left from here
[1:36:05] as he was leaving he said preach the
[1:36:08] word
[1:36:21] and there's a fight there there's a
[1:36:24] fight
[1:36:24] um over everything now that's right i
[1:36:27] mean we're going to lose everything all
[1:36:29] power here
[1:36:30] as far as electricity in about seven
[1:36:32] minutes so
[1:36:33] if you're if you're worried about that
[1:36:35] i'm not
[1:36:37] [Applause]
[1:36:51] [Music]
[1:36:53] now notice here all of them that want to
[1:36:55] make
[1:36:56] some creed or we want a magnet of
[1:36:58] jerusalem as he said
[1:37:00] we want to make we want to make us
[1:37:02] somebody
[1:37:03] you can move closer if you need to
[1:37:07] fact if you want to get close to
[1:37:08] anointing don't sit way back there get
[1:37:10] up here
[1:37:16] come on notice again you know our you
[1:37:19] know
[1:37:20] they want to make a creed
[1:37:23] three means this is what we believe they
[1:37:26] want to make this in jerusalem that's
[1:37:27] right
[1:37:28] you know but but again the catholics
[1:37:30] would like to make wrong deseries
[1:37:32] right all men must come to wrong they
[1:37:35] must play
[1:37:36] oh basically you know the methodist was
[1:37:38] theirs to be
[1:37:39] you know let me just say the
[1:37:41] organizational moves in this message
[1:37:43] want to make it make their movement
[1:37:46] amen in jerusalem right this is where
[1:37:50] you have to come
[1:37:51] where you got to come is you got to get
[1:37:53] in the cross
[1:37:54] [Applause]
[1:37:57] god's only place of safety
[1:38:00] jesus
[1:38:07] [Applause]
[1:38:15] now again where god chooses
[1:38:19] the fight the fight is over jerusalem
[1:38:21] today
[1:38:22] who owns the name of god right you know
[1:38:26] who is the place where god is chosen to
[1:38:28] place his name
[1:38:30] where all men must come to worship right
[1:38:33] again this is where the fight is is the
[1:38:35] fight for preeminence
[1:38:37] here's the bible you know let me just
[1:38:40] say
[1:38:41] no church no preacher right no man no
[1:38:44] matter his title
[1:38:46] is as pastor or bishop or apostle
[1:38:49] or pope is out for him amen
[1:38:53] you have one husband one day
[1:38:56] you know that's the best the preacher
[1:38:57] the pastor is the friend of the
[1:38:59] bridegroom
[1:39:00] yes i meant to introduce the bride to
[1:39:03] christ but the bride
[1:39:04] doesn't belong to the preacher the pride
[1:39:08] belongs to the bridegroom
[1:39:11] amen oh but you know a man who
[1:39:14] covet god's place of dominion over his
[1:39:18] people they want preeminence that's
[1:39:19] right
[1:39:20] and then this news the very messages
[1:39:23] itself that god gave us to give us
[1:39:25] freedom
[1:39:26] remember this message to give us freedom
[1:39:30] [Applause]
[1:39:32] amen to strip out the denomination
[1:39:36] you are the everyone have the holy ghost
[1:39:41] [Applause]
[1:39:51] but you know again men covet god's place
[1:39:54] and dominion over his people
[1:39:56] that's why as a pastor i refuse to be
[1:39:58] your holy guilt
[1:40:04] amen i refuse to take lordship over
[1:40:08] you buy the kind of car you want come on
[1:40:12] take the vacations you want make sure
[1:40:15] you're led by the holy ghost
[1:40:17] not by laodicea
[1:40:24] whether or not you just become lukewarm
[1:40:27] cold and formal
[1:40:28] okay and therefore you don't have the
[1:40:30] desire that you're supposed to have to
[1:40:31] be in the house of god
[1:40:34] and don't think i don't have the right
[1:40:35] to preach against sin
[1:40:39] but i don't have a right to make you
[1:40:40] living and it wouldn't help if i
[1:40:43] didn't make it sitting back there
[1:40:47] in the back there and we've given that
[1:40:50] spot there where
[1:40:51] when you stand up he can see and and and
[1:40:55] and so there he he gets a special
[1:40:57] privilege seat back there every service
[1:40:59] yeah because i wanted to be able to see
[1:41:01] when when
[1:41:03] when you're when you all stand you can
[1:41:05] still see yeah
[1:41:06] and so but i mean many years ago he said
[1:41:08] that's him
[1:41:09] i know i can live with god i i can do
[1:41:12] right
[1:41:13] if you just go with me to work and to to
[1:41:16] town or
[1:41:31] whether you need some preaching
[1:41:33] somewhere to tell you
[1:41:34] how to live and what to do and to go
[1:41:37] with you everywhere and make life's
[1:41:39] decisions
[1:41:40] you're to seek the holy ghost for that
[1:41:42] he have preeminence
[1:41:44] in your life and and the holy ghost will
[1:41:47] have the preemies listen
[1:41:48] i've heard pastors personally heard of
[1:41:51] my upgrade
[1:41:52] rebuke individuals for taking vacations
[1:41:54] without their permission
[1:41:56] nicolaitanism there's nothing wrong with
[1:41:59] being
[1:42:00] with taking vacations and being gone
[1:42:02] from church on occasion but i'll tell
[1:42:04] you this
[1:42:04] when it becomes a regular thing that
[1:42:07] you're all doing
[1:42:08] that all the time that's wrong amen
[1:42:11] but i'm not gonna make your personal
[1:42:13] decision
[1:42:15] you've got to have the holy ghost and
[1:42:17] seek him as to what you do
[1:42:19] i just know that we've got a
[1:42:21] responsibility to the world
[1:42:24] and man we've got a responsibility in
[1:42:26] the world we're not able to preach that
[1:42:28] to the world right now but we have got
[1:42:30] responsibility to the world as the sound
[1:42:33] of our voice
[1:42:34] goes around the world to instruct to
[1:42:36] encourage
[1:42:37] to build up the body of christ and you
[1:42:39] participate in that
[1:42:47] when you can go fishing or where you can
[1:42:49] go hunting
[1:42:50] i ain't making decisions on that you
[1:42:53] make decision
[1:42:54] but like brother rotten said if you're
[1:42:56] way out in the wilderness somewhere on
[1:42:57] the hunting trip and there's no church
[1:42:59] around there's nothing you can do if you
[1:43:01] speak
[1:43:01] i believe it'd be all right if you're
[1:43:03] around the city the word church is going
[1:43:05] on you should attend church by all means
[1:43:09] amen but don't think as i said that
[1:43:11] pastors don't have the responsibility
[1:43:13] and truth to get
[1:43:14] laodicea and we look for in conditions
[1:43:17] that people want to put pleasures
[1:43:19] ahead assembling themselves together
[1:43:22] preachers have the responsibility
[1:43:24] to call out sin as brother friends and
[1:43:27] playing call from sunday at picnic
[1:43:29] parties and
[1:43:30] swimming and things instead of attending
[1:43:32] church sitting home on wednesday night
[1:43:34] watching television still attending
[1:43:36] shirt and feel like something
[1:43:38] saying something about it but the lord
[1:43:40] will put them out what's the matter
[1:43:42] it's love again looking out his window
[1:43:44] and seeing the sin
[1:43:46] and afraid to call sin sin but you see
[1:43:49] what people
[1:43:50] want today is a son of kiss some king
[1:43:54] saul to be
[1:43:55] a king over them instead of god oh my
[1:43:58] this is this is where we want to move on
[1:44:00] from here let me just tell you
[1:44:02] among men it's not supposed to be that
[1:44:06] that he said you know those that are
[1:44:07] considered rulers
[1:44:10] of the gentiles lorded over them and
[1:44:12] their great ones
[1:44:13] exercise authority over them but it
[1:44:16] shall not be so among you
[1:44:18] but whoever would be great among you
[1:44:20] must be
[1:44:21] your servant whoever be first among you
[1:44:23] must be a slave of all
[1:44:26] but you see nicholas who destroys those
[1:44:28] press
[1:44:29] precepts and instead separates the
[1:44:31] minister from the people
[1:44:33] and makes the leaders of the lords over
[1:44:36] instead of servants as peter said
[1:44:39] neither being lords of
[1:44:40] god's heritage but being examples
[1:44:43] to the flock so we are to lead the flock
[1:44:48] by feeding the world we preach the word
[1:44:51] you can apply every now the message is
[1:44:55] the trumpet call of freedom
[1:44:57] it is a juvenile trumpet saying you're
[1:45:00] afraid for christ
[1:45:02] is to have preeminence but can you
[1:45:05] imagine how satan wants to use
[1:45:08] message the message itself to build
[1:45:11] again
[1:45:12] denominational walls and many of them
[1:45:15] are worse
[1:45:16] than the mother herself
[1:45:19] dividing churches dividing families
[1:45:23] through you know forbidding fellowship
[1:45:25] saying
[1:45:26] all maturity can only come by belonging
[1:45:28] to a certain group
[1:45:30] that the token can only be obtained by
[1:45:32] belonging to a certain group
[1:45:33] that corruption can only hide in a
[1:45:36] certain group
[1:45:37] let me tell you it's not a group affair
[1:45:41] i want to get it to you
[1:45:44] [Applause]
[1:45:50] his presence in the individual with a
[1:45:52] personal
[1:45:53] vindication of himself expressing
[1:45:56] himself
[1:45:57] the living word that's promised for the
[1:45:59] day expressing itself through you
[1:46:01] a vindication of the great revelation of
[1:46:03] god look
[1:46:04] only in the individual never a group
[1:46:08] an individual not in the group his
[1:46:11] identification is with
[1:46:13] an individual you get that not with the
[1:46:16] methodist the baptist not the president
[1:46:18] here not the lutheran not the
[1:46:19] pentecostal but as an individual
[1:46:21] i'll take one and leave one i'll
[1:46:23] separate them do you know that's going
[1:46:24] on
[1:46:26] he'll take one he'll leave one he'll
[1:46:28] take one he'll leave one
[1:46:31] come on yeah everybody doesn't circle
[1:46:34] right there and there
[1:46:35] this is the way that it works he will
[1:46:38] take it and
[1:46:48] [Applause]
[1:46:50] vindication of an impregnated child of
[1:46:53] god
[1:46:54] filled with the holy ghost so surrender
[1:46:56] to god that he don't care
[1:46:58] about anything else and the holy spirit
[1:47:00] is living his life
[1:47:02] pulsating through him showing the
[1:47:04] personal vindication of the word itself
[1:47:07] expressing itself to the people and to
[1:47:09] the world
[1:47:10] that's right amount of personal
[1:47:12] vindication
[1:47:14] not a church dedication a personal
[1:47:17] visitation every person loves
[1:47:29] and now but you see each group wants to
[1:47:32] claim to be jerusalem
[1:47:34] men wants to sit in the place of worship
[1:47:37] and it's all about the children of the
[1:47:39] slave woman
[1:47:40] that wants to be heir with the children
[1:47:43] of the free woman
[1:47:44] these spirits have been back in genesis
[1:47:48] where jews sarah's lack of faith in her
[1:47:50] position
[1:47:51] as a mother of the chosen race in her
[1:47:54] weakness she gave
[1:47:55] a slave girl hagar to be the mother of
[1:47:58] the race
[1:48:00] therefore today they're still now the
[1:48:03] preeminence
[1:48:04] the fight for the preeminence the jews
[1:48:08] the original orders they claim the
[1:48:10] muslims they claim
[1:48:12] the catholic and the protestant
[1:48:14] denomination they want to be the
[1:48:16] jerusalem
[1:48:17] the battle is all about moving the
[1:48:20] squads
[1:48:23] am i the person who would a squatter is
[1:48:26] a person
[1:48:26] who unlawfully occupies an uninhabited
[1:48:30] building
[1:48:31] our peace of life yeah hey
[1:48:34] so this is what is going on this is what
[1:48:37] the struggle has been about here
[1:48:38] recently
[1:48:39] yeah the rights the battles that have
[1:48:42] been in gaza
[1:48:43] has been over the supreme court
[1:48:46] decision of israel giving rights to the
[1:48:49] israeli to
[1:48:50] legally remove palestinians from
[1:48:52] properties
[1:48:53] purchased by the jews and when they just
[1:48:55] heard that they were going to be
[1:48:57] here and a decision to aim to death
[1:48:59] right
[1:49:00] and when they just heard about it they
[1:49:03] began to write
[1:49:05] and upload you see this is something's
[1:49:07] happening
[1:49:09] the very moment he heals
[1:49:19] [Applause]
[1:49:38] [Applause]
[1:49:45] [Applause]
[1:49:54] is
[1:50:04] [Applause]
[1:50:08] historically speaking in 1982 the
[1:50:11] palestinian residents
[1:50:13] signed an agreement accepting the jewish
[1:50:15] ownership of the land
[1:50:17] while being allowed to still live there
[1:50:19] as protected tenants
[1:50:21] and the palestinian residents have since
[1:50:24] repudiated the agreement and
[1:50:26] ceased to pay rent so they wanted to
[1:50:29] squat that they don't want
[1:50:31] they don't want to pay rent they don't
[1:50:32] want to recognize even the agreement
[1:50:35] that they signed
[1:50:36] now that's just like the devil oh you'll
[1:50:39] agree that the promise is yours
[1:50:40] as long as you don't try to possess it
[1:50:43] yeah
[1:50:44] yeah come on but i want you to know that
[1:50:47] heaven's supreme court has taken the
[1:50:50] seals off of the book
[1:50:52] yeah all the ancient records and so
[1:50:55] plainly
[1:50:56] that the throne is ours
[1:51:00] remember he said in the expedition of
[1:51:02] the seven churches
[1:51:03] what the church had
[1:51:08] originally she had the pure word of god
[1:51:11] she had the power of the spirit
[1:51:13] manifest and guide the signs and wonders
[1:51:15] and gifts of the holy ghost
[1:51:18] amen
[1:51:21] [Applause]
[1:51:32] is
[1:51:42] [Applause]
[1:51:46] god
[1:51:49] [Applause]
[1:51:58] that's when the war begins
[1:52:05] revelation 12 and 7 i want to just show

[1:52:21] the dragon
[1:52:22] and the dragon fought and his angels he
[1:52:25] ain't given up easily that's right
[1:52:28] listen church can you make a mistake
[1:52:30] when you get
[1:52:31] you think you get prayed far and the
[1:52:32] devil's just going to get up and play
[1:52:34] dead
[1:52:36] he's going to fight you he will bring
[1:52:38] your unbelief there he is within the
[1:52:40] wars that will take place right on the
[1:52:41] platform

[1:52:48] [Applause]
[1:53:02] amen there would be all kinds of things
[1:53:04] that would be happening
[1:53:06] since it would even annoy men when
[1:53:08] brother branham would tell him to bow
[1:53:09] your heads
[1:53:11] yeah that's rubber chicks and man
[1:53:13] because of all the unbelief
[1:53:15] that was perfect just bow your head and
[1:53:18] they refused to do it
[1:53:20] and they would fall out under demon
[1:53:21] spirits when they were cast out
[1:53:24] is that right but notice that wall was
[1:53:27] in heaven and the eight
[1:53:28] michael and his angels fought against

[1:58:09] [Music]
[1:58:17] [Music]
[1:58:18] is
[1:58:20] [Music]
[1:58:32] is
[1:58:39] we're talking about how great our god is
[1:58:42] and i just want to give a testimony to
[1:58:44] that um
[1:58:46] i don't know how many people there's
[1:58:47] been several quite a few people that
[1:58:49] know
[1:58:49] last year i was served two lawsuits
[1:58:53] uh concerning the business and
[1:58:56] uh they've been going on for months and
[1:58:59] i had asked i'd come up several times
[1:59:01] for prayer
[1:59:03] asking the brothers to pray and timothy
[1:59:06] and brother aaron and brother tim
[1:59:07] all had preached such tremendous
[1:59:08] services on he is our warrior god
[1:59:11] he fights for us in the battle
[1:59:15] let him fight the battle he fights for
[1:59:18] us
[1:59:19] and i just wanted to testify that about
[1:59:21] a month ago
[1:59:24] the first one came to trial my lawyer
[1:59:27] had called me the day before
[1:59:28] not trial but had went to court the
[1:59:30] lawyer had called me the day before and
[1:59:32] said
[1:59:32] there's two different ways if this was
[1:59:35] to be dismissed that it could be
[1:59:37] dismissed
[1:59:39] and he explained it to me he said this
[1:59:42] would be the best outcome and he
[1:59:43] explained it he said but there's a very
[1:59:44] slim chance that that will happen
[1:59:46] he said it could be dismissed in another
[1:59:48] way
[1:59:50] and so i had actually flown to tucson to
[1:59:52] see my mom
[1:59:54] he called me about two hours after i
[1:59:55] landed and he said i just want to tell
[1:59:57] you that the court
[1:59:58] today the judge dismissed it in the way
[2:00:00] that i didn't think he would
[2:00:03] he said and it's dismissed and uh
[2:00:06] he said there's a small chance it could
[2:00:08] come back
[2:00:09] in a in about 30 days there's an
[2:00:11] opportunity for it to be
[2:00:13] you know maybe resurface but it has not
[2:00:17] and god has totally taken that and i
[2:00:20] just want to give him all the praise and
[2:00:21] the honor of glory
[2:00:23] because he is faithful he is in every
[2:00:26] situation i can testify over the last
[2:00:28] three years there's been situations
[2:00:30] where
[2:00:31] god has proved himself faithful over and
[2:00:34] over
[2:00:35] and over again it may not be even a
[2:00:38] sickness as a trial you're going through
[2:00:39] it could be another type of trial
[2:00:41] but i just want to testify god is
[2:00:43] faithful there's another one that's
[2:00:45] going to be heard this week the second
[2:00:47] one
[2:00:48] and i just covet all your prayers
[2:00:50] knowing our god is faithful he's going
[2:00:52] to take care of this one too and i want
[2:00:53] to thank him right now
[2:00:55] ahead of time for that
[2:01:15] amen well if you did it before he'll do
[2:01:18] it again
[2:01:19] amen that's that kind of god we serve
[2:01:21] god bless you today
[2:01:23] i know this has kind of ended a little
[2:01:24] different and maybe not the way we
[2:01:27] thought it would be going but god knows
[2:01:30] and he's faithful amen and we we want to
[2:01:34] thank him for his goodness and his mercy
[2:01:35] let's sing that again
[2:01:37] i don't know if the deacon's got some
[2:01:38] flashlights or something they can turn
[2:01:40] on them mezzanines especially
[2:01:42] we'll let them the mezzanine be
[2:01:44] dismissed first
[2:01:46] and uh be brought down very very
[2:01:50] safely as possible
