[7:10] And how he picked me up and turned me
[7:16] around. How he placed my
[7:21] feet. Oh, on solid ground.

[8:45] makes me want to
[8:49] [Music]
[8:51] shout. Hallelujah. That's what we're
[8:53] here to do
[8:54] tonight. Amen. Let's just all stand
[8:56] together as we Amen. are here and
[9:00] slimmer crowd than normal. Amen. But we
[9:03] know God can move. Amen. Amen. Where two
[9:06] or three are gathered. Hallelujah. Amen.
[9:10] Before we go to the Lord in prayer, we
[9:12] have a few praise or a few prayer
[9:13] requests this evening. I want to
[9:15] remember to continue to pray for the
[9:17] Hollis family. Sister Hollis has been
[9:19] sick and body, I believe, was taken to
[9:21] the hospital this week and needs
[9:23] strength and a touch in her body. Also,
[9:26] we have a prayer request uh that was
[9:28] turned in for Brother Kenny. He's been
[9:30] um battling COVID, but also now has
[9:33] pneumonia. He's been very sick. Sister
[9:35] Jeanie has also been sick. She uh asked
[9:38] that we would remember both of them in
[9:40] prayer tonight.
[9:42] Want to continue to remember to pray for
[9:44] Sister Marilyn Griffith as well. Very
[9:46] weak in in her body. If you have a need
[9:50] you want to just lift to the Lord
[9:52] tonight. Say, "Come by my way, Lord."
[9:54] Amen. He's mindful of each one.
[9:58] Amen. And
[10:00] now let the weak say, "I am strong."
[10:08] Let the poor say, "I am
[10:13] rich." Because of what the Lord has
[10:21] done for
[10:24] us. And
[10:28] now let the weak
[10:31] say, "I am strong."
[10:36] Let the poor say, "I am
[10:41] rich because of what the Lord has
[10:50] done." Oh, give
[10:52] thanks. Give
[10:56] thanks. Yes, Lord. That's what we're
[10:58] here to do tonight, Father. To give
[11:00] thanks to you for all that you've done,
[11:02] Lord. Lord, we can stand here with
[11:04] assurance knowing, Lord, no matter what
[11:07] the storms of life are, Lord, the storms
[11:10] that are in the atmosphere around us,
[11:12] many situations that we're battling,
[11:15] Lord, that we can stand with assurance
[11:16] and say, "I'm strong because of what
[11:19] you've done for us." Lord, I think of
[11:22] these prayer requests that have been
[11:23] turned in for the church here, Lord.
[11:25] Sister Marilyn, Sister Hollis, Lord, the
[11:28] camps, Lord, you see the needs in their
[11:30] body. each one of them, Lord, that's
[11:32] Lord, a dedicated and faithful servant,
[11:35] asking that you'll touch them tonight.
[11:37] Lord, I think of another request that
[11:39] was sent over earlier today of a young
[11:42] man in North Carolina that had just come
[11:44] back to the Lord, just come back to
[11:46] church last Sunday and then passed away
[11:49] in an accident unexpected. And Lord, his
[11:52] family needs a touch from you, Lord.
[11:54] They need a healing in that church,
[11:56] Lord. But we thank you for moving on his
[11:58] life before he went home, Lord. And
[12:01] Lord, we ask tonight, no matter what the
[12:03] situation is, if it's somebody here,
[12:06] somebody that's been long lost, Lord,
[12:08] away, a prodigal, we ask you'll move on
[12:10] lives here, Lord. Lord, you see the
[12:13] congregation, not very many, but we
[12:15] stand together in unity, Lord, asking
[12:18] that you'll move, Lord. Asking that
[12:20] you'll be in the songs that are sung,
[12:22] Father, that you'll anoint brother
[12:24] Timothy as he ministers the word, Lord,
[12:26] and use him in a mighty way, Father.
[12:29] Lord, not him as a man, Lord, but the
[12:31] gift inside that you would speak through
[12:33] him, Father. Lord, touch each one that's
[12:35] here, Lord. Touch those that are
[12:37] streaming, Lord, may be sick in a
[12:39] hospital or at home, Lord, in pain.
[12:42] Lord, but you see the need. We commit it
[12:45] to you and we love you, Father. We thank
[12:48] you for the time we have. We pray you'll
[12:50] bless the tithes and the offering. Bless
[12:52] those that are away traveling. It's in
[12:55] Jesus Christ's name we
[12:56] ask. Hallelujah.
[13:00] Hallelujah. Key of
[13:02] G.
[13:04] Amen. And the brothers can take up the
[13:06] offering this
[13:08] evening. Amen.

[28:56] we ought to be in
[28:57] expectation. no matter what it looks
[28:59] like around us or what's going on around
[29:02] us or what's happening in our midst that
[29:06] we're expecting God to do something and
[29:08] God to move and touch hearts and
[29:11] lives. Amen. Let's just go to him in
[29:17] prayer. Father, we just come to you
[29:20] today, Lord. just ask that you would
[29:23] come and lead us by your word and your
[29:26] presence, Lord, as only you can do.
[29:29] Father, we just in much need of
[29:31] direction in our lives. And Lord, we
[29:34] just want to know that we're in your
[29:37] will and in the place that you want us
[29:39] to be, Father. Lord, we ask Lord you'd
[29:42] come and touch hearts tonight and
[29:44] minister, Father, by the word of the
[29:46] Lord and
[29:48] encourage, Lord, as we look at ourselves
[29:50] and we sometimes seem so insignificant
[29:53] and seem like maybe we don't matter, but
[29:57] Lord, we do matter to you. And Lord,
[30:00] what matters to us matters to you,
[30:02] Father. And we know that you have it in
[30:04] control. and we just ask that you would
[30:07] come and take these few thoughts and and
[30:11] Lord express them to the hearts of your
[30:13] people. We pray. We ask in Jesus
[30:16] name.
[30:19] Amen. Amen. Let's turn our Bibles to
[30:21] Mark chapter 12.
[30:24] I
[30:26] actually actually gave a different title
[30:29] uh earlier and I sorry to mess up the
[30:32] stream I guess but speak on fa I want to
[30:34] speak on faith of the widow. Amen. Faith
[30:38] of the widow just something the Lord
[30:41] dropped in my heart just a few minutes
[30:43] ago and just asked the Lord to have his
[30:46] way. Mark chapter 12 and verse 41. And
[30:48] said, "And Jesus sat over against the
[30:51] treasury, and beheld how the people cast
[30:54] money into the treasury. And many that
[30:58] were rich cast in much. And there came a
[31:02] certain poor widow, and she threw into
[31:05] mites, which makes a farthing." She
[31:08] called unto him, and he called unto him
[31:10] his disciples, and saith unto them,
[31:13] verily I say unto you, this poor widow
[31:16] hath cast more in than all they which
[31:19] have cast into the treasury. For all
[31:22] they did cast in of their abundance, but
[31:25] she of her want did cast in all that she
[31:28] had, even all her living. Amen. We'll
[31:32] let you be seated.
[31:39] As I said, uh, just kind of standing in
[31:43] a a peculiar place today because, you
[31:45] know, you study things and you expect to
[31:47] go a certain direction and and God has a
[31:50] way of doing things sometimes in just
[31:52] the last moments. And so, you just want
[31:54] to want to be yielded vessel unto him
[31:56] and and just ask the Lord to direct. You
[31:59] know, it's not what I want to preach
[32:00] anyhow. It's what what he has desired.
[32:03] Amen. And and I' I've I've been thinking
[32:05] on this thought a little bit here and
[32:07] there for the last few weeks. I actually
[32:09] had the opportunity to uh and I I I just
[32:12] want to pass this around. You can look
[32:14] at it and pass it one to another. Uh
[32:17] brother, you can look at that. It's
[32:19] called a widow's might. It's just a
[32:21] small very insignificant coin. Doesn't
[32:24] look very much. Actually, in that day,
[32:27] it was worth about a half a cent. It was
[32:30] worth about a half a cent or so. as you
[32:32] can look at the and study on that for a
[32:34] moment. It doesn't look like very much.
[32:37] It doesn't look like and of course it
[32:38] wouldn't pay for very much. But Jesus
[32:42] looked at this and he's watching as
[32:44] people come to the place and come to the
[32:46] house of God and they're casting in the
[32:49] money to support the ministry and to
[32:51] support things and and and you know he's
[32:53] watching the rich give of their
[32:55] abundance. But he makes a very
[32:57] astounding statement as we've read. He
[32:59] he looks at that and he says, "Now I
[33:02] want to ask you who gave more." You
[33:04] know, yeah, there's more in value maybe
[33:06] given by this person or more money or
[33:08] that maybe this one gave a hundred bucks
[33:10] or this one gave a thousand or whatever.
[33:12] He said, "But I want you to see what
[33:14] true value is is this woman was willing
[33:17] to give of her all." And I I think
[33:20] that's what we we're all called to.
[33:22] Amen. It may not look like much. We may
[33:24] in our own lives seem very insignificant
[33:27] and very unimportant, but to God, amen,
[33:30] we matter. Amen. God looks upon our
[33:33] lives. He created us before the
[33:34] foundation of the world with a thought
[33:36] in mind of who he wanted us to be and
[33:39] how he wanted us to be. And so when we
[33:41] come to him, Amen. He he wants us, he
[33:43] wants to look that we're not just giving
[33:45] out of what we have of an abundance, but
[33:48] we're given our all. No matter if we
[33:50] don't think we have anything else to
[33:52] live in on or we don't and I'm not even
[33:54] talking about monetary value right now.
[33:56] I'm talking about our lives that we give
[33:58] everything that we have to him and for
[34:01] his kingdom. And brother Brandon would
[34:03] say it like this. He said, "Remember
[34:04] Jesus seen a widow passing one day where
[34:07] the rich men was putting in much of what
[34:10] they had because they had much and they
[34:12] were putting in the treasury and and the
[34:14] widow passed by and maybe a couple of
[34:16] little hungry children walking by her
[34:18] side and but she gave everything she had
[34:22] about two two widows might or two
[34:24] pennies and and Jesus said, "Who paid
[34:26] the most?" He said, "Now, if I would
[34:28] have been standing there, I would have
[34:29] said, you know, don't do that, sister.
[34:31] you know, we got plenty of money, but he
[34:33] never stopped her. He knew he had
[34:36] something greater for her down the road.
[34:40] Hallelujah. I believe that that's what
[34:42] God wants. Amen. And he wants to see us
[34:44] willing to sacrifice what we want or our
[34:47] dreams or what we want to do because he
[34:49] knows if we're willing to do that, he
[34:51] has something greater for us down the
[34:53] road. And I I believe something greater
[34:55] is more than even a better job or a
[34:57] better home or or or lands or money or
[35:00] temporary values. But God will has
[35:02] something greater for us down the road.
[35:04] Amen. What's greater than a body change?
[35:06] What's greater? Amen. Than a home that
[35:09] never goes in disrepair any longer or or
[35:12] the moths don't inhabit or the or the
[35:14] fungus don't eat down. Amen. A house
[35:17] that will not decay. I I tell you that's
[35:19] something greater that's right down the
[35:20] road for the believers. But it takes
[35:23] everything that we have. We have to be
[35:24] willing to lay aside the little things
[35:27] in our lives. And Amen. or or the big
[35:29] things, whatever it is to surrender to
[35:31] God's will. Amen. You know, he said, "If
[35:33] I'd have been standing there, I'd have
[35:34] said, "Don't do that, sister." You know,
[35:36] we got plenty of money. We we got it
[35:38] taken care of. But he never stopped her.
[35:41] See, he knew something was greater for
[35:44] her down the road. And and we can take
[35:46] that over again to the widow there.
[35:48] Amen. the gentile widow that the prophet
[35:50] of God would come to and she would give
[35:52] of her last meal and and and you know if
[35:55] she would not have gave of that last
[35:56] meal offering if she would not have gave
[35:58] that last bit of that she had to survive
[36:01] on amen she would have never got to the
[36:03] well or to the barrel that wouldn't run
[36:05] dry she'd have never got to the place
[36:08] where the oil would have never ran dry
[36:10] amen but so because she was willing to
[36:13] give her all she knew when I give this
[36:15] is all I got when I give this. There's
[36:18] nothing left. There's nothing there I
[36:20] can I can I can re uh I I can come back
[36:23] to and I can depend on on my own. I'm
[36:25] laying everything out there before God.
[36:27] And that's that's where we got to come
[36:29] before God. We have to be willing, amen,
[36:31] that we're not leaving a little reserve
[36:33] or we're not leaving a little something
[36:35] later we can depend upon or later we can
[36:37] go back to, but we're laying it all out
[36:40] there upon the altar of God and saying,
[36:42] "God, consume this sacrifice." And it's
[36:45] not I'm not giving it because I got a
[36:47] lot to give or I got a lot of abilities
[36:50] or I got a lot of a lot of things I can
[36:52] give. But I'm giving it because I want
[36:55] to give my all. I believe that's a
[36:57] wonderful thing that we can be in this
[36:59] age that we're living in. A people who's
[37:02] willing to give their all. They're
[37:03] willing to give their all to Jesus
[37:05] Christ. I I look at a world that's
[37:07] submitting their minds and their bodies
[37:09] and their thinking to the and giving
[37:11] their all to the spirits of hell and
[37:14] it's coming out of them and it's it's
[37:16] permeating out of their lives. But what
[37:18] about a people who's willing to give
[37:20] themselves completely totally
[37:22] surrendered under the power of God that
[37:24] it doesn't matter what comes or what
[37:26] goes. I surrender everything that I
[37:29] have. I surrender my dreams. I surrender
[37:32] my my my wealth. I surrender what few
[37:35] pennies I got. Whatever it is, I give my
[37:38] all. Amen. This is where he what he
[37:40] desires and what he looks for. He you
[37:43] know he said but if I'd have been there
[37:44] I'd have said don't do that. He said but
[37:46] she had something right down the road.
[37:49] He said another place he said I wish I
[37:51] was financially able. Talking about
[37:53] giving to meetings you know to never
[37:55] have to mention an offering. He said I
[37:57] have to mention it somehow. Uh because
[37:59] he said, "I did that one time by a great
[38:01] check that somebody was giving me more
[38:03] than I thought that should be given. I
[38:05] wouldn't accept it." So the brother
[38:06] said, "Well, I tell you what I'll do.
[38:08] I'll just take the check and if you come
[38:10] and go to the meeting, Amen. take up one
[38:12] offering anything." I said, "That's
[38:13] fine. I'll do it." And he's he's talking
[38:15] about offering. I did that and it was
[38:17] not a success. He says, "People has to
[38:21] have something in the meeting."
[38:24] Come on now. people has to have
[38:27] something in the meeting. Now, he's
[38:29] talking about money, but it's beyond
[38:31] just money.
[38:33] Come on. It's beyond just money. It's
[38:35] beyond just a few cents you got in your
[38:37] pocket or or a few dollars you got in
[38:39] the bank. Amen. That's Amen. Everybody
[38:42] must have something, Amen. invested in
[38:44] every service.
[38:46] Amen. It must be something that they're
[38:48] willing to surrender or they're willing
[38:50] to give up or they're willing to lay
[38:52] down. Amen. that God can come down and
[38:55] have preeminence in that service and in
[38:57] that place. He said, "I, you know, I did
[38:59] that one time and it wasn't a great
[39:01] success." He says, "People has to have
[39:04] something in a meeting. It's their
[39:06] meeting."
[39:09] Amen. We're a little bit low in numbers
[39:10] this this evening that we're normally
[39:12] used to on a Wednesday night, but it's
[39:14] still our meeting tonight. It's our
[39:16] meeting that we can meet face to face
[39:18] with God and we can have a conference
[39:20] with him and we can have a moment with
[39:22] him and we can have our time to come
[39:25] drop what we have in the offering plate.
[39:29] Amen. And like I said, I'm not talking
[39:32] about your jingle in your pocket.
[39:35] Amen. I'm talking about what's inside of
[39:38] you. Amen. That we have something to
[39:40] offer to God. We're always wanting
[39:42] something back from God. We want this
[39:44] and we want that. We want joy. We want
[39:47] happiness. We want peace. We want this.
[39:49] Amen. But God is looking for us to have
[39:52] something to give back to him.
[39:55] And that's in every service that we're
[39:57] willing to lay our pride and our our
[40:00] thoughts and how insignificant we may
[40:02] feel. Amen. Do you know what this woman
[40:04] must have felt like when she come in
[40:06] there and she dropped two little, you
[40:08] know, two little mites in there about a
[40:09] cent's worth and people were dropping
[40:11] hundreds and they were dropping this and
[40:13] rich men of the world were doing this.
[40:15] But God looked at that and said that
[40:17] woman gave more because she gave her
[40:20] all.
[40:22] Come on now. Amen. How why does God look
[40:25] at us when we come to the house of God?
[40:27] Does he look at us because we got the
[40:30] this or we got that. Or does he look at
[40:32] us and say that person gave everything.
[40:35] Amen. That person laid everything down.
[40:37] Therefore, I can come and move upon
[40:40] their hearts.
[40:43] Amen. He said because if you don't, it's
[40:46] not a success. People have to have
[40:49] something in the meeting. It's your
[40:52] meeting. They meet me on the street and
[40:54] they ask what's the matter with this
[40:55] meeting? We haven't we haven't got no
[40:57] part into it. They don't even take up an
[40:59] offering. So an offering is part of
[41:01] worship.
[41:04] Amen. An offering is part of worship.
[41:07] Amen. You know, he says, I know more
[41:10] than ever since the other day when I was
[41:13] going to give what had Wright had given
[41:15] to me, and she she was a poor little
[41:17] woman. She gave $20 to towards a
[41:20] building fund and she had pledged it
[41:22] towards this new tabernacle in
[41:23] Jeffersonville. and I was going to give
[41:25] it back to her because I knew she
[41:27] couldn't afford it.
[41:30] I knew that that she didn't really have
[41:32] it to give. And I knew there's others
[41:34] maybe maybe there were others that had
[41:36] something more to give and they could
[41:38] give more and maybe she wouldn't have
[41:40] to. But if she didn't give a be a part,
[41:42] if she couldn't give a part, she
[41:44] wouldn't be a part.
[41:46] Come on. But he said, "I found out just
[41:49] a little later why God stopped me from
[41:52] giving it back to her."
[41:55] Come on, somebody. Amen. We know the
[41:58] story. He went over to her house to give
[42:00] her that money. And while they're there,
[42:02] they're fellowshipping around the things
[42:04] of God. And he's telling them what had
[42:06] happened in the woods. And he's telling
[42:07] them about the squirrels that were
[42:09] created. And all of a sudden, out of
[42:11] Hadr Wright's lips came, "That's nothing
[42:13] but the truth.
[42:17] And God looked at her and said, "This
[42:20] woman has given ma her all."
[42:24] And brother said, "A super anointing
[42:27] came into the place and said, you tell
[42:29] her to ask what she will and it'll be
[42:31] given back to her." And we know the
[42:34] story. He said, "If you want a million
[42:35] dollars, I believe there'll be a million
[42:37] dollars sitting here on this table. If
[42:39] you want your sister to be healed, I
[42:41] believe she'd be healed in just a few
[42:42] moments." But God knew the heart. God
[42:45] looked in there and knew she wanted more
[42:47] than just a temporary million dollars or
[42:50] temporary healing. She wanted the
[42:52] salvation of her two boys.
[42:55] Amen. And because she had given her all
[42:58] and responded to the word of God, God
[43:00] came on her thing and brought it back a
[43:03] 100 or a thousand or a millionfold.
[43:06] See, God will always give back more than
[43:09] you give.
[43:12] Amen. He he he's never he's never been
[43:15] indebted to no
[43:16] one. I've seen it happen over and over.
[43:20] God always give back more than you
[43:24] give. You give more of your time, God
[43:27] always give more
[43:31] back. You give more of your love, God
[43:34] always give more back.
[43:37] Come on. Amen. You give more of mercy
[43:40] and you give more grace. God will always
[43:42] give more back. Amen. You give more of
[43:45] yourself and your pride. Amen. God will
[43:47] always repay more back. God will give
[43:50] you a spirit of love and happiness and
[43:52] joy. Amen. God will place something on
[43:54] you. Amen. More than what you could ever
[43:56] think or ask. This is the kind of God
[43:58] that we serve. He will never be indebted
[44:00] to no one. If you can't give but two
[44:02] might as long as it's all you can give.
[44:06] Now tonight, if you can give a hundred
[44:08] bucks, you better give it all.
[44:11] I'm talking more than money right now.
[44:13] I'm talking about what you can give in a
[44:16] service. Amen. Amen. We need a couple of
[44:18] hundred bucks tonight. We need some
[44:19] mics. We need some things. We need
[44:21] people to cash in and say, "God, I I I
[44:24] want to give everything that I have
[44:26] because I know that you're you're a
[44:27] rewarder to them that diligently seek
[44:30] you. And if I give my whole heart, if I
[44:32] give my whole effort, if I give
[44:34] everything that I have, you will reward
[44:37] according to what I have given and
[44:39] little as much when God is in it.
[44:45] Could you imagine the mind battles this
[44:47] woman went through? She didn't have
[44:50] much. She wasn't the, of course, the
[44:53] riches that came into the tabernacle.
[44:55] God's not looking upon how rich you are
[44:58] financially speaking.
[45:01] Thank
[45:03] God. If if getting over there depended
[45:06] on how much money I had here, I'd be one
[45:08] of the last in
[45:10] line. Come on. Elon Musk or one of them
[45:13] other fellas, they'd be way up ahead of
[45:15] us. But it ain't about the money that we
[45:17] got here.
[45:19] Amen. It's not about how much money you
[45:21] got in this church or how much how much
[45:24] uh uh uh how how big a job you got and
[45:26] how much affluence you have. That's not
[45:28] what it's about.
[45:30] What it's about is how much have you
[45:32] surrendered to him? How much have you
[45:34] given to him? How much have you laid
[45:36] yourself on the on the altar of God? He
[45:39] says, see, he said, I believe, he said,
[45:41] I of course I don't believe in begging.
[45:42] I don't believe in begging people or
[45:44] just but just tell people and let it be
[45:46] like that. He said, God takes care of
[45:47] the rest of it. He sure does. he if he
[45:50] puts it on somebody's heart. But many
[45:52] times I think you'll put it up on their
[45:54] heart to do something and then I've
[45:56] turned around and conflicted that by
[45:58] saying, "No, I wouldn't take it. No sir,
[46:00] I wouldn't do it." And I think about
[46:02] Jesus with that little widow putting all
[46:04] of her living. Amen. A couple of cents,
[46:07] a th and thousands of dollars a rich man
[46:09] had put in. But he never stopped her. He
[46:12] let her go on because he knew what he
[46:15] was going to do for her later. Amen.
[46:18] Now, I don't know if the Bible ever
[46:20] records what he did for her later, but I
[46:22] can promise you if God saw her giving
[46:25] her all, God has a place for her
[46:27] tonight. God has a place that has Amen.
[46:30] all the things she ever had need of and
[46:33] so much more than she could ever think.
[46:35] Amen. God has that afforded unto her
[46:37] because he saw her giving everything she
[46:41] had.
[46:43] If we could do that tonight, if we
[46:44] could, it's not just about the preacher
[46:46] getting up and giving everything he has
[46:48] and laying out himself before the Lord
[46:50] and laying himself out and yielding
[46:53] himself. No sir, it's about all of us
[46:56] yielding ourselves to God so God can
[46:58] come down and God can speak and God can
[47:01] touch and God can heal and God can say
[47:04] and God can fill with the Holy Ghost.
[47:08] It takes all of us laying out our own. I
[47:11] don't care if it is nothing but a
[47:12] widow's
[47:18] might. But Satan wants to make you think
[47:21] sometimes what I just you're so
[47:24] insignificant. This woman thought no
[47:26] doubt had those thoughts in her mind.
[47:29] I'm just
[47:30] insignificant.
[47:32] Nobody's my little two cents or my
[47:34] little two mightes is not really going
[47:36] to make that much a difference.
[47:39] If you give your all, it always makes a
[47:43] difference. It doesn't matter how little
[47:46] it is. It doesn't matter how
[47:49] insignificant you might think it is. If
[47:52] it's your all, it makes a difference. If
[47:54] it's your all in a service, it always
[47:57] makes a difference. You know, the story
[47:59] is often as we listen looking at this is
[48:02] called the story of the widow's might or
[48:05] the story of the widow's offering. But
[48:08] here Jesus is sitting with his disciples
[48:11] as we read and he's he's sitting there
[48:14] apparently close to where the treasury
[48:16] is because he can watch things are
[48:18] taking place and he's watching people
[48:20] depositing
[48:22] money and and here here were these
[48:24] receptacles there for people to put
[48:26] money in. And Jesus watched as the rich,
[48:29] you know, were bringing in big large
[48:31] sums of money in. But here comes this
[48:34] little woman with two coins in her
[48:35] hands.
[48:38] One place would call them two small
[48:40] copper coins which makes a penny. The
[48:42] King James version calls them
[48:45] mites. Just a little something. These
[48:48] were the smallest denominations of
[48:51] coins. The widow put her coins in the
[48:54] box and Jesus called his disciples to
[48:56] him and put pointed out her
[49:01] action. Do you understand what took
[49:04] place? She'd done something that caused
[49:06] Jesus to respond.
[49:11] Come on now. It didn't look like much.
[49:15] It wasn't much compared to others as far
[49:18] as outwardly looking and outwardly
[49:20] counting and and counting up the money
[49:22] and counting up the It didn't look like
[49:24] much. But what she did caused Jesus to
[49:27] respond to her or respond or talk about
[49:30] her or look her way or or notice what
[49:33] she was doing or notice what she was
[49:36] going through or noticing her struggles
[49:38] or noticing her situation.
[49:42] You want Jesus to notice you? Amen. You
[49:45] have to be willing to lay it all on the
[49:47] line
[49:48] that I don't know how I'm going to make
[49:51] it tomorrow, but I know he promised he's
[49:53] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[49:56] And the same God that brought me to
[49:57] today will be there for me tomorrow.
[50:00] Even though I've laid it all out there,
[50:02] and I've given all I've got, and I ain't
[50:04] got nothing else to give, I know my
[50:06] God's a provider. I know my God is more
[50:09] than able for any situation. It does not
[50:11] matter what I'm going through. God's
[50:14] able.
[50:23] Jesus
[50:26] watched. Yeah, it shows you that he's a
[50:29] god of
[50:32] details because he would later he would
[50:34] speak or maybe before somewhere in the
[50:36] scripture there he tells of the story
[50:38] about the eyes of God are always on the
[50:41] sparrow.
[50:43] It's the smallest in most insignificant
[50:47] bird. It's almost nothing compared to
[50:50] the beauty of other birds that no doubt
[50:52] have greater beauty and maybe better
[50:54] songs and a better abilities and worth
[50:58] more and a and more value and you know a
[51:04] greater Sorry, Sister Ruth. says Ruth
[51:07] been get she gotten into bird watching
[51:09] and so there's some birds on her list
[51:10] she really wants to
[51:12] see but I I mean she sees sparrows and
[51:15] they're they're common and and you know
[51:17] you don't think much about them and and
[51:19] and usually they're they can be a pest
[51:21] and you sometimes want to get rid of
[51:23] them just being
[51:25] honest. Amen. So in our eyes maybe they
[51:28] don't seem to be so significant but
[51:30] apparently in God's eyes they are cuz he
[51:33] said not even a sparrow can fall to the
[51:36] ground. without the heavenly father
[51:37] knowing about it. So he's a god of
[51:40] small. He's a god of insignificance.
[51:43] He's a god, amen, that when you feel
[51:45] like nobody notices and nobody cares and
[51:48] I don't have the prettiest song and I
[51:50] ain't got the best abilities and I can't
[51:52] do this and I can't be the I can't play
[51:54] the piano or I can't sing a lick. Amen.
[51:57] That's not what God desires. Sure, God
[51:59] loves good music and God loves good
[52:01] singing and God loves good worship, but
[52:04] God wants our all. Amen. I've seen some
[52:07] people with the most beautiful voices
[52:09] that God couldn't use them a lick. Why?
[52:11] Cuz they could not give their all.
[52:15] Come on, somebody. I saw people that was
[52:18] good ministers that God couldn't use
[52:20] them. Why? Cuz God, they was not willing
[52:23] to lay it all out upon the altar or lay
[52:26] it out there where God could come and do
[52:28] what he need what he does.
[52:31] But we look at it that God is the God of
[52:35] the
[52:38] insignificant. I I I think that probably
[52:40] should made somebody
[52:42] shout because the devil is always trying
[52:44] to make you feel very insignificant.
[52:49] Well, I don't get I don't I don't do as
[52:51] much at the church that so and so does
[52:54] or I I I don't have my I don't have a
[52:57] place. You know, we we we get that weird
[52:59] feeling sometimes. But God is not
[53:02] worried about a
[53:04] place. Come on. He's worried about a
[53:07] surrendered heart, a soul that he can
[53:10] use. Amen. Some of the most powerful
[53:14] people in a church is people you don't
[53:16] realize or recognize what they do, but
[53:18] in their homes, Amen. in their prayer
[53:20] closets.
[53:22] Amen. Bombs are going off. Amen. Demons
[53:26] are being defeated. And And we may not
[53:28] even recognize it or see it. Oh, we see
[53:30] brother so and so, he does this. Or
[53:32] sister so and so, she sings like this.
[53:33] Or brother, brother this brother, he
[53:36] preaches like this. If I could just be
[53:37] like that. No. God called you to be you.
[53:42] And you might feel insignificant
[53:44] tonight, but God is apparently wanting
[53:46] you to know he's watching you. His eyes
[53:49] upon you. If his eyes upon a little
[53:51] bitty bird, don't you know that somebody
[53:54] he created to be in his image, he is
[53:56] watching you. He is taking care of you.
[53:59] He is looking over you. He is watching
[54:01] every step of the way. And this God will
[54:04] be truthful and faithful. He will not
[54:06] leave you. He will not forsake you. You
[54:08] might fall to the ground, but he'll know
[54:10] about it. And he'll come by and he'll
[54:12] pick you up. You might stumble. You
[54:14] might you might get depressed, but he'll
[54:16] know about it. And he'll send something
[54:18] along to raise you up out of there.
[54:27] This woman
[54:29] She gives two of those little coins.
[54:30] Where's that coin at about right now?
[54:32] Right there, brother Daryl. Two little
[54:34] two little coins. So, did it did it look
[54:37] like much to
[54:40] you? I dare say most every I'd say
[54:43] everybody to would have more than that.
[54:45] Even the child has more than that in
[54:47] their piggy
[54:52] bank. Smallest denomination of coins.
[54:56] And the widow put her coins into the
[54:59] box. And Jesus said called his disciples
[55:03] together and pointed out her
[55:06] actions. Pointed her
[55:09] out. Pointed her out and said, "Truly I
[55:12] tell you, this poor widow has put more
[55:14] in the treasury than all the
[55:18] others." Not just one of the others. All
[55:22] of the others.
[55:25] Do you see where she ranks in the
[55:26] kingdom of God? Amen. That's where it's
[55:29] important. Where you rank in his eyes.
[55:33] Amen. Did he see you and say you're
[55:36] worthy? Amen. Did he see you and say,
[55:38] "Yes, you're worth me coming down and
[55:40] giving my life for." I say he does.
[55:42] Amen. I say he did. Amen. I believe he
[55:44] looked at you in his very own image and
[55:46] said, "That's my son. That's my
[55:48] daughter." Sure, Satan may have got them
[55:50] all scarred up, messed up, tore up,
[55:52] tangled up, but I got a blood that'll
[55:54] loose them and set them free. Amen.
[55:56] That'll lift them up into a place where
[55:58] they really belong. And God saw you, a
[56:01] wounded, broken winged sparrow
[56:07] looks so insignificant to anybody else
[56:09] walking by, but God rich in mercy.
[56:16] There's a couple of things. the story as
[56:18] we look at
[56:19] it. First, God sees what man
[56:26] overlooks. Man sees the outward things,
[56:29] you know, of, you know, oh, wow, he's
[56:32] he's a great preacher. He's a great
[56:35] singer. He's a great musician. She is.
[56:38] That's what we see, you know. And then
[56:40] we get these ideas that we're being
[56:42] spiritual. And I don't I don't know why
[56:43] I'm going here, but we're being
[56:44] spiritual because we got our ranking of
[56:46] our favorite preachers and ranking of
[56:48] the That ain't nothing about being
[56:50] spiritual. That's about being pre have
[56:52] preferences. Come on. Right. Amen. That
[56:55] ain't how God does
[56:57] it. God's not looking at this. Oh,
[57:00] Timothy PR, he's one of my favorite
[57:01] preachers because he does he No, he's
[57:03] not looking at it that way. He's looking
[57:05] at things men don't see.
[57:08] He's looking at hearts on the inside and
[57:11] what they're willing to lay down and
[57:12] what they're willing to give up and what
[57:14] they're willing amen to lay there and
[57:16] say, "You know what? I I'm not
[57:18] interested. This not this is not what I
[57:20] want to give it all to him. I want to
[57:22] lay it all at his feet." See, God sees
[57:25] what man overlooks. Amen. The big gifts
[57:28] in the temple were surely noticed by
[57:31] people. Well, look at brother so and so.
[57:34] He gave $1,000. And look at this one.
[57:36] Wow. Look at all that money dropping in
[57:37] there. And look at this. And meanwhile,
[57:39] this insignificant widow's walking by
[57:41] and she drops two little
[57:47] mites. Nobody says
[57:49] anything. Nobody says good job. Nobody
[57:53] says, "Wow, we appreciate you. You done
[57:57] you done done a lot for us." Nobody says
[58:00] it. But the king of heaven saw her and
[58:04] that's all that matters. See, it's not
[58:05] important what that other people see
[58:07] you.
[58:09] There's a lot of things people do I I've
[58:11] I've marveled that you find out later
[58:13] that they done in life that you would
[58:15] have never known what they done.
[58:18] There's many of men that are filthy rich
[58:20] that you would look at them and you
[58:22] would never guess in a hundred years
[58:24] they was a rich man. You matter of fact,
[58:26] as far as you was concerned, they was
[58:28] nothing but a
[58:29] bum. But yet they had done things. They
[58:32] had done things out of sight, out of
[58:33] mind. and they had built wealth and they
[58:35] had built the abilities to buy land and
[58:38] this that and the other. I I had that I
[58:39] had that happen as far as working for
[58:42] somebody some one day I was going to as
[58:44] when I was doing some remodeling and I
[58:45] was going to remodel this kitchen. So I
[58:47] gave her this lady a price and come
[58:49] back. She called me back a couple months
[58:50] later. She said, "Hey, I want you to
[58:52] come back and relook over this with me
[58:54] because I got a lot more work." And I
[58:55] said, "Okay." So I come over there and
[58:57] she she went she wanted her whole house
[58:59] redone. And I thought, "Man, what's
[59:01] what's changed here?" you know, cuz she
[59:03] was first telling me, you know, watch
[59:04] the price and watch this and watch that.
[59:06] Now I want my whole
[59:08] house. And I said, "Well, what?
[59:10] Apparently something's changed." She
[59:12] said, "Well, you ain't going to believe
[59:13] this." He said, "I I I me and my other
[59:16] two cousins. We had this fourth cousin.
[59:19] We're all was we didn't have no
[59:20] siblings, but we had each other as
[59:22] cousins." And said, "We was always
[59:24] really close." And and I think it was
[59:26] three girls and this one man. And this
[59:28] man had passed away. And they get called
[59:30] to judgment as far as the reading of the
[59:32] will. And they have no idea that this
[59:35] man has land all over Clayurn, Webster,
[59:38] all all over Louisiana. He has land
[59:40] everywhere. He has money in the bank.
[59:42] And they were close to him. They had
[59:44] been around him. They had went out to
[59:46] suppers together. They had went to
[59:48] parties together. They had done a lot of
[59:49] things as as they even as they would if
[59:52] they were brothers and sisters naturally
[59:54] speaking. But amen, there was just
[59:55] cousins. But they spent all this time.
[59:57] And she said, "We were just stunned. We
[59:59] our our mouths were hanging over open
[1:00:02] because we had no idea.
[1:00:06] And I think that's the way it's going to
[1:00:07] get when we get on the other side.
[1:00:11] Brother, I believe he spoke about it. He
[1:00:13] said there'll be people there that you
[1:00:14] didn't expect and people there that that
[1:00:16] ain't there that you did expect. Amen.
[1:00:19] Because why? We look on the outward
[1:00:21] things, but God's looking in the inward
[1:00:24] heart. He's seeing the hidden things of
[1:00:26] our lives and the hidden deepest
[1:00:28] secrets. And sometimes we may not know
[1:00:31] that this person, amen, has the riches
[1:00:33] and and is in the presence of God and
[1:00:35] done the things of God because they
[1:00:38] ain't like a bunch of Pharisees is just
[1:00:40] out. Look at me what I've done. Look at
[1:00:41] this what I've
[1:00:46] done. But God sees it and that's all
[1:00:50] that matters.
[1:00:54] Jesus saw what no one else
[1:00:58] saw. He saw the humble gift of a poor
[1:01:02] widow
[1:01:05] woman. This was the gift that Jesus
[1:01:08] thought worthy of comment to say
[1:01:11] something to put her in red letter
[1:01:16] words. This was the gift that disciples
[1:01:19] he thought the disciples needed to be
[1:01:21] aware of. So he would bring it to their
[1:01:23] attention. The other gift in the
[1:01:25] treasury that day made a lot of noise as
[1:01:27] they jingled.
[1:01:30] But the widow's might were heard in
[1:01:33] heaven.
[1:01:36] Come on, somebody. Amen. It ain't about
[1:01:38] making a bunch of noise here on earth. I
[1:01:40] I want you to understand that that's not
[1:01:42] what our service is about. It's not
[1:01:44] about a bunch of noise.
[1:01:46] It's about it reaching heaven and heaven
[1:01:49] hearing our cry and heaven responding to
[1:01:52] it.
[1:01:58] God's evaluation is different from
[1:02:00] man's. You know, the widow's two might
[1:02:02] added up to a penny according to man's
[1:02:04] tabulation. But Jesus said that she had
[1:02:06] given more than anyone else that
[1:02:09] day. How could this be? You know when
[1:02:12] when many rich men threw in large
[1:02:16] amounts, the difference
[1:02:22] was it was the
[1:02:26] proportion. If you got a million dollars
[1:02:28] and you throw in a thousand, that's
[1:02:30] really not much money compared to the
[1:02:33] million dollars, right? Is my math
[1:02:36] mathing?
[1:02:39] If you have a million dollars and you
[1:02:40] pick out a thousand bucks, that's about
[1:02:42] like you you having a thousand bucks and
[1:02:44] throwing in a penny
[1:02:47] somewhere close to that
[1:02:50] $10. And so as far as proportion wise
[1:02:53] compared to what they were worth to what
[1:02:54] they were given, this is why Amen. It
[1:02:57] matter it mattered more to God because
[1:02:59] he saw amen she gave her whole portion.
[1:03:03] She gave everything that she had. Jesus
[1:03:05] said that she had given more than anyone
[1:03:07] else that day. Amen. The rich were given
[1:03:10] large sums, but they still retained
[1:03:12] enough to make sure their futures were
[1:03:15] taken care
[1:03:17] of. That the next day they could pay
[1:03:19] their water bills and the next day they
[1:03:21] could they could do whatever and the
[1:03:22] next day they could buy this piece of
[1:03:23] land and the next day we're going to do
[1:03:25] this and we got plans and we got that.
[1:03:26] So, I can't I I got I got this money
[1:03:28] ready for a certain place. No, again, I
[1:03:30] want you to understand I'm talking about
[1:03:32] more than just money tonight.
[1:03:35] Money is not my subject.
[1:03:38] It's what portion do we give of
[1:03:40] ourselves?
[1:03:44] Good. Brother Brandham said if you'll
[1:03:45] give 50, he'll take 50%. You give 60,
[1:03:48] he'll take it. If you give 70, he'll
[1:03:49] take. But he desires a
[1:03:52] 100%. He desires everything that we
[1:03:54] have. Amen. The difference is the
[1:03:56] proportion of what the rich had given
[1:03:58] compared to what the widow had given.
[1:04:00] She put in everything. She put in all
[1:04:04] she had to live on.
[1:04:07] Come on, somebody. If we can just every
[1:04:10] service make this declaration. I'm
[1:04:12] putting in everything.
[1:04:14] I'm not saving some strength for
[1:04:16] tomorrow. I'm not worried about
[1:04:17] tomorrow. I'm putting in everything. I'm
[1:04:21] laying it all out there so God can have
[1:04:24] the glory in my life.
[1:04:31] hers was a true
[1:04:39] sacrifice. That's why the Bible would
[1:04:42] say we're to give a sacrifice of praise.
[1:04:45] Understand? When you feel like praising
[1:04:47] and you
[1:04:49] praise, that's praising. But when you
[1:04:52] don't feel like praising and you praise,
[1:04:54] that's a sacrifice of praise.
[1:05:00] Amen. When you don't feel like lifting
[1:05:02] your hands and you lift them anyway, you
[1:05:03] don't feel like lifting your voice and
[1:05:05] you do it anyhow. You don't feel like
[1:05:07] getting into the service and you do it
[1:05:09] anyhow. That is a sacrifice.
[1:05:12] You came to church tonight. Some of you
[1:05:14] probably didn't feel like it, but you
[1:05:16] came anyhow. That is a sacrifice. We
[1:05:19] came in spite of the bad weather. That
[1:05:21] is a sacrifice.
[1:05:26] put in
[1:05:29] everything. Another thing to take from
[1:05:31] it is God commands giving in
[1:05:34] faith here. You know, this woman was no
[1:05:37] doubt in need of receiving
[1:05:41] charity. I mean, you try living on two
[1:05:45] pennies. No doubt she needed charity,
[1:05:48] but yet she had faith to give.
[1:05:53] Even though the amount even though the
[1:05:55] amount was negligible and why what could
[1:05:57] a widow's might buy? She gave it in
[1:06:00] faith that God could use what she gave.
[1:06:05] This is why you give it so God can use
[1:06:07] it. This is why you lay it there. So God
[1:06:10] can use what you give.
[1:06:14] The widow's faith is also evident in the
[1:06:16] fact that she gave the last of her
[1:06:18] money.
[1:06:21] It's
[1:06:22] easy.
[1:06:25] Well, we get into paying ti. It's easy
[1:06:27] to pay ti when you see, well, I got
[1:06:29] enough left over. I have to pay tithe to
[1:06:30] pay bills. I I got enough to go out to
[1:06:33] eat and I got enough to do this and I
[1:06:35] Yeah, I can go ahead and give my tithe.
[1:06:36] That ain't what he said.
[1:06:39] He said, "Bring a tenth into the al into
[1:06:41] the offering of God. Give give of it
[1:06:43] first." He required it of slaves when
[1:06:46] they first come out of Egypt.
[1:06:49] Hello. Oh, he didn't wait till they got
[1:06:50] rich and they got land and they got they
[1:06:52] got all kinds of things that they they
[1:06:54] had the abilities to give give money.
[1:06:56] No, he he he required it of slavery.
[1:06:59] They had just come out of slavery and
[1:07:01] they they didn't have a bunch and they
[1:07:03] didn't have lands and they didn't have
[1:07:04] all the But he said, "If you'll give,
[1:07:06] I'll bless you more than you give."
[1:07:09] We've seen it over and over and over. If
[1:07:11] you'll lay it out there, God is a God
[1:07:13] who will not just repay it, but he'll
[1:07:16] give you more than you could ever think
[1:07:17] or ask.
[1:07:24] She gave away her last means of self-s
[1:07:29] support. Well, that's a hard one right
[1:07:32] there because we we like to have that
[1:07:34] support.
[1:07:36] Self-support, make our way, you know,
[1:07:38] and do our thing. Does that mean the
[1:07:39] widow left the temple completely
[1:07:41] destitute and went home and died of
[1:07:44] starvation? No.
[1:07:46] The Bible teaches that God provides for
[1:07:48] our needs.
[1:07:50] So he could not teach that without
[1:07:52] providing for her.
[1:07:55] We may not know the story as far as it
[1:07:57] written out in history and say and be
[1:07:59] able to say, "Oh, look at there. She got
[1:08:00] this, that, and the other." But God took
[1:08:02] care of her. How do you know, brother
[1:08:03] Timothy? Because his word says he does.
[1:08:06] Amen. His word said that he would take
[1:08:08] care of our needs and her situation. The
[1:08:10] Bible shows us that he's a God that
[1:08:13] provides for our needs. We don't know
[1:08:14] the details of this particular woman's
[1:08:17] future, but we can be certain she was
[1:08:19] provided for. We can be certain that she
[1:08:22] is provided for. We can be certain that
[1:08:24] today she's not destitute and that she's
[1:08:27] not wandering out around in the realms
[1:08:29] of the lost, but God made a way for her.
[1:08:35] We can be
[1:08:42] certain. One person speaking about this
[1:08:44] said, "It's
[1:08:46] interesting that Jesus commented on the
[1:08:49] widows, but before he commented about
[1:08:51] her might, he commented on the scribes,
[1:08:53] saying they devour widows
[1:08:59] houses." The religious officials of the
[1:09:01] day, instead of helping the widow in
[1:09:03] need, were perfectly content to rob them
[1:09:06] of their livelihood and
[1:09:08] inheritance. The system was corrupt. The
[1:09:11] darkness of the scribes greed makes the
[1:09:13] widow's sacrifice even shine even more
[1:09:16] brightly. God loves a cheerful
[1:09:21] giver. And let me say, it's better to be
[1:09:24] able to give. The Bible says it's better
[1:09:26] to give than to
[1:09:28] receive. Right? You know what that
[1:09:30] really means? It's better to be in the
[1:09:32] position to give than have to be in the
[1:09:35] position to receive.
[1:09:39] Get you get it? It's better that you're
[1:09:41] in the place that you can give of what
[1:09:44] God has given you than instead of being
[1:09:46] in a position and having to beg or
[1:09:48] having to call or having a need. Amen.
[1:09:50] It's better to be in this
[1:09:56] place. God is faithful to take care of
[1:09:58] his own.
[1:10:02] The weaker we are, the greater the glory
[1:10:06] is that will rebound to
[1:10:11] him. You know, it was it's in the little
[1:10:14] things. It was in a weak broken or a
[1:10:17] weak withered up rod of Moses and he
[1:10:20] would take that rod and he would destroy
[1:10:23] the works of
[1:10:24] Egypt. It it was it was in the weakness
[1:10:27] of Gideon when he was forced Amen. to
[1:10:30] acknowledge of his weakness and his and
[1:10:33] his past defeats and come to a place
[1:10:35] that God could use him like never
[1:10:37] before. He didn't use him with great
[1:10:38] numbers and great armies. Matter of
[1:10:40] fact, he brought a great army together
[1:10:42] and God said, "You got too many. Got too
[1:10:45] much." You went down, whittleled them
[1:10:47] all down till they got to 300. And God
[1:10:49] said, "Now I can use you." Because you
[1:10:51] know why? God's not interested in us
[1:10:53] getting the glory. It's not about our
[1:10:55] own glory and our own. That's what
[1:10:57] church church is not about our own
[1:10:59] glory. It's not about what I've done or
[1:11:02] haven't done. It's about what God has
[1:11:04] done.
[1:11:08] One stone, little stone shot from a a
[1:11:12] sling, defeated a seemingly invincible
[1:11:15] giant, and caused the whole army of
[1:11:17] Philistines to flee. One stone.
[1:11:25] It was one boy's lunch that fed 5,000
[1:11:30] men
[1:11:31] plus women and
[1:11:33] children. One boy's
[1:11:36] lunch, but he was willing to give his
[1:11:38] all. He was willing to lay it down. And
[1:11:42] but in each case, these examples
[1:11:44] represent common everyday things which
[1:11:47] the intervention of intervention of God
[1:11:49] turned into something extraordinary.
[1:11:53] It was God who would use the weaknesses
[1:11:55] of men and bring victory in their lives.
[1:12:00] This is what he wants. He's not looking
[1:12:01] for strong men or, you know, just
[1:12:03] strong, you know, dependent on their own
[1:12:05] strength and abilities. Listen, God will
[1:12:08] get us sometimes on the flat of our back
[1:12:10] for we'll realize it ain't about you, oh
[1:12:12] boy. It's about me. And I have you in
[1:12:14] control. And if you'll lay yourself down
[1:12:16] and submit, I can do great things
[1:12:19] through you.
[1:12:22] This is what he's looking for. This is
[1:12:25] what he's wanting. He's wanting somebody
[1:12:28] that can have the faith. Well, I want
[1:12:30] great faith. We'll just start out with
[1:12:32] the faith of a
[1:12:37] widow. Just use this for an example.
[1:12:40] that one of our own our own present day
[1:12:43] widows, Sister Barbara Ristler, was left
[1:12:47] with an insurmountable
[1:12:50] task. A widow woman with 12 children,
[1:12:53] youngest just weeks
[1:12:56] old. But the testimony is that she
[1:12:59] depended on God.
[1:13:01] There'd be times when the w the
[1:13:03] electricity was about to be cut off and
[1:13:05] all of a sudden a random mail would
[1:13:07] random check would come in the mail just
[1:13:09] enough to cover
[1:13:11] it. God moved in insurmountable ways and
[1:13:14] in unthinkable ways to provide for them
[1:13:18] and to bring them to a place. And you
[1:13:19] know what the amazing thing of it was?
[1:13:22] That when she got older in her old age
[1:13:24] and her death that she could testify,
[1:13:26] I've never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:13:29] or the or his seed begging bread and in
[1:13:31] her death and in her at her death that
[1:13:34] she was able to give money to another
[1:13:36] widow.
[1:13:39] Come on. Why? Because God had provided
[1:13:43] every step. Listen, he's not he's not
[1:13:46] just enough. He's more than enough.
[1:13:48] He's Jehovah Gyra. He'll take care of
[1:13:51] you when you ain't got nothing else and
[1:13:53] you've laid it all down. You say,
[1:13:55] "Father, here it is. You're just in a
[1:13:57] place God can take you and use you for
[1:14:00] his glory."
[1:14:02] Have the faith of a widow that's by our
[1:14:06] hearts.
[1:14:23] Maybe you feel like you're down to your
[1:14:25] last two
[1:14:26] mites. Go ahead and put them in the
[1:14:28] offering for his
[1:14:31] glory. I'm down to my last ounce of
[1:14:34] strength, brother Timothy. Put it in his
[1:14:37] offering for his
[1:14:39] glory. And see if he won't respond to
[1:14:41] you.
[1:14:43] If he responded to that
[1:14:45] one, he'll respond to
[1:14:48] you. If you're willing to give your
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:59] all. Wonder how many
[1:15:02] tonight say,
[1:15:05] [Music]
[1:15:06] "Lord, I want to put my two might
[1:15:10] in. I want to give up my all,
[1:15:14] Lord. Lay it at your
[1:15:17] feet. Realize it ain't about me. It's
[1:15:20] about you for your glory and for your
[1:15:25] honor. Hallelujah.
[1:15:28] Lord
[1:15:29] Jesus, just in these last few moments,
[1:15:31] dropping this into my
[1:15:34] heart, just trying to follow
[1:15:37] you, knowing it's not about what we want
[1:15:39] to preach or what we want to do or what
[1:15:41] we want to
[1:15:42] say. It's about you, God.
[1:15:48] We just ask Lord that you would use this
[1:15:50] little thought to spur someone to
[1:15:53] realize that they have a God who's
[1:15:56] watching them and he sees it even though
[1:15:59] nobody else sees it. Nobody else may say
[1:16:01] good job. Nobody else may say thank you.
[1:16:05] Nobody else may
[1:16:06] say any words of recognition of
[1:16:10] praise. Lord, that's not what matters to
[1:16:12] a true believer.
[1:16:17] All we are looking for is for your
[1:16:20] approval to be approved by God that you
[1:16:24] can respond to us in our time of
[1:16:26] need, in our
[1:16:29] situation. We love you, Lord. You've
[1:16:31] seen the hands that were lifted all over
[1:16:33] this
[1:16:34] building. Father, we just ask God, you
[1:16:37] just touch each heart and each life by
[1:16:39] your glory and
[1:16:41] grace in Jesus name.
[1:16:44] [Music]
