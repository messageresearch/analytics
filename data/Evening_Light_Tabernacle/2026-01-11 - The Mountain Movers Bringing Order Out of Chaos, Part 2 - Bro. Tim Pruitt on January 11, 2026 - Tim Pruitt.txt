Whatever situation, his name is greater. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're glad to have brother Buster, Sister Libby Wiggins back with us today. Amen. Brother Buster called and just wanted to me to give thanks for all that prayed for him while he was having surgery with the blood clots and then they faced the flu afterwards. Just really thank the Lord for your prayers. And it's a comfort when you're in a situation like that to know you got real Christians praying for you. Somebody that can touch the heart of God for you. And so, Amen. And I I believe when people write prayer requests in, they're not doing it as a formality, but they're doing it because they believe that the Lord's going to hear the prayers of the righteous and and answer them. Amen. Brother Glenn Tomlinson is asking for prayer for his upcoming chemo treatment this Wednesday. So, he's been allergic to having allergic reactions, various things, uh various uh previous chemos. So going try a new one this week and just asking the Lord to uh undertake for him. Uh brother Peter Gayley's sister Julie had a stroke a couple of weeks ago. She's facing surgery to unclog an artery this week. Ask the Lord to be merciful on her behalf. The Burrow family wrote in. They're still sick. Needs need touch in their lives and their bodies. Also, we want to remember brother Alvin Adams this morning. His legs are really swollen. Can't hardly walk. Also, we have brother Aaron that's ministering there in Canada. And brother Joe is also away ministering. How many would have a need today? You just want to make it known to the Lord. I'm ask brother Sam Patton if he'd come and open our service in prayer and take these needs before the Lord. Let's just pray together. Amen. That the Lord hears our prayers and answers these needs. Amen. His name is great &gt;&gt; and greatly to be praised. You know, Wednesday, I didn't think I was going to be here. AT&T had shipped me to Monroe for the week. Well, Wednesday, my machine happened to break down. I had to come back to Shreport to get another machine Wednesday. So, God made a way. &gt;&gt; I didn't think there was a way, but God made a way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's just go before him this morning. Oh God, your name is great and greatly to be praised, Lord. Lord, you're mighty. You've done so much for us, Lord. Lord, we can we can get irritated. We can get down, Lord. But if we would just look up, you've done so much for us. Oh God, we thank you for touching Brother Buster, Lord, and all he's all they've been through. Lord, we pray that you'll just continue continue to touch his body, Lord. Give him a complete recovery, Lord. Lord, this one face in chemo again, Lord. Lord, it's poison in our bodies, Lord, but we pray that you'll just use it, Lord. Use it for your glory. All things are possible through you, Lord. God, we pray that you'll just take a hold of this service, Lord. Anoint each one for your glory, Lord. Help each one of us to get ourselves out of the way, Lord, that you might come and use each one of us, Lord. The musicians, Lord, Brother Timothy as he leads us in song, Brother Tim as he comes and ministers the word to us. Lord, help each one of us to get out of the way. Lord, just open up our hearts to you, Lord. Lord, as brother Tim said, you know, it's the worship that he desires, Lord. It's the worship you desire for each one of us, Lord. Help us to open ourselves up to what you would have, the worship you would have, Lord. Oh God, we just pray that you'll just touch lives in this service, Lord. Comfort the those who need comforted, Lord. Heal those who need healed, Lord. Save the lost, Lord, among us. Bring those back that need you, Lord. Oh, we thank you, Lord Jesus. We ask your blessings upon this service in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. That name that is above every name for your glory. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Hallelujah. Want you to turn around, shake one's hand, welcome each other here. I know we got a lot of guests here this morning. If you have one next to you, make sure you make them welcome today. And amen. I sing that song, paid in full by the blood of the lamb, says G. Paid in full by the blood of the lamb. Oh, free from sin. Free to live. Now I am. And on the page where my sins were written down, paid for by the blood. Well, let's take a long this morning. Sing it again. Oh, paid for by the blood of the lamb. Free from sin. Brea in on the day where my sins were written down. Painful by the blood of the lamb. There was no praise. No one worthy to be found among. What a precious son of God with a cross and thorny crown paid the death with the blood of the lamb. Oh great by the blood. Oh lamb lamb from sin. Now I am your gradful by the blood of the lamb. Oh how great was the debt that I owed for the seeds I had sown. joy in Jesus my Lord. The great treasure I found I redeemed by the blood of the lamb. By the blood of the lamb free from sin, free live. Now I am read on where my sins are written down paid for that last of the lamb. Oh how great was the debt that I owe. bound to pay for the seed I had sown. But if Jesus my Lord great treasure I found by the blood of the lamb by the blood of the lamb. Free from sin. Free to live. Now I am in the grape where my sins are written down. Paid for by the blood. Oh paid for painful by the blood of the lamb free from sin. Oh yes, Lord. He's on the p where my sins were written down.

Open your hopes on be eternal and hold to God. Hold to God's unchanging. Hold to God's unchanging hand. Oh, let's hold to God's unchanging hand. Open your things eternal. God's changing hand. Hallelujah. Let's be seated. Ask brother Will Robinson if he'd come this morning and bring his special Amen. Let's just worship the Lord together with him. There will be mountains that I will have to climb. And there will be battles that I will have to fight. Victory or defeat, it's up to me to decide. How can I expect to win if I never try? I just can't give up now. I've come too far from where I started out. Nobody told me the road would be easy. And I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me. Never said there wouldn't be trials. Never said I wouldn't fall. Never said that everything would go the way I wanted to go. But when my back is against the wall and I feel a hope is gone, I'll just lift my hands up to the sky. Say, "Help me to be strong. I just can't give up now. I've come too far from where I started out. Nobody told me the road would be easy. And I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me. I know you didn't bring me out here to leave me lonely. Oh, but when I can't see clearly, I know that you are with me now. I just can't give up now. I've come too far from where I'm started. Nobody told me the road would be easy. Don't believe he brought me this far to leave me. I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me. I don't believe he brought me this far to lead me. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that this morning? &gt;&gt; He didn't bring us this far to leave us. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for that. Let's sing this together. Amazing grace shall always be my song of praise. For it was grace and bought my liberty. I do not know just how he came to love me. So he looked beyond all my faults and he saw my needs. I shall forever lift my eyes to Calary to heal the cross. Jesus, he died for me. have all the grace that calmed my fallen soul. He looked beyond all my faults and he saw my needs. It was God's grace that brought me out of darkness into the light where I can clear the sea. I'll shout it from all the mountains and the valley. He looked me up all my faults. Oh, thank you Jesus. I shall shall forever my eyes to calary. Oh, the cross where Jesus died. He to die amongst the grace that call my fallen soul. be to beyond all my faults. Sing that second verse again. My knees. It was God's grace that brought me out of darkness. Oh, into the light where I can clearly see. Oh, I'll shout it from over the mountains and the valleyies. He looked beyond all my thoughts and he saw my needs. I shall forever lift my eyes to Calary on the cross where Jesus died. Oh, he died for me. How far the grace that caught my soul soul. He looked beyond all my faults and he saw my needs. Oh, I shall forever. Oh yes, I shall my eyes to calary where Jesus died for me. He died for me. &gt;&gt; I want my soul. He looked beyond. Oh, aren't you thankful? He looked beyond all your faults and he saw my needs. Oh, I shall forever lift my eyes. Amen. Sister Courtney, come with your special this morning to the cross where Jesus died. &gt;&gt; Oh, he died for me. I'm marvelous. The grace that caught my he all my faults all my needs. Hallelujah. I know maybe most of you saw the post sister Courtney made of this song and last Sunday. Brother Tim would give us title and words would begin to flow through our heart. She's here to sing it this morning. Amen. That God's going to bring order out of your chaos. &gt;&gt; Brother Tim's preaching that again this morning. So I believe God's aligned some things up. Amen. We're looking for order to be restored. Amen. Complete divine order of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just worship the Lord together. The whole world lay silent in darkness. There was no motion, no order. You looked upon it. heartbeat knowing the life that you have lived. So you breathe your breath form planets. You hung the stars in their place. Day after day, you you brought order until you stepped back and saw that it was good. You step into the chaos and bring order. You step into sorrow and bring joy. You send your word. And there's healing. The darkness dissolves when you speak. Let there be light. Change every You saw the earth filled with chaos. Barely a light of hope was found. You looked upon it. heartbeat knowing the life that you have led. So you sent your son down to save us to die for the sins of every man. No longer would death be the victory for you triumph and the grave. You step into chaos and bring order. You step into sorrow and bring joy. You send your word and there's healing. The darkness is fall when you speak. You step into chaos and bring order. You step in a sorrow and bring joy. You save your word. And there's healing. The darkness dissolves when you speak. Let there be light. Change everything. Now my night is turned to morning. Now my future is redeemed. My past mistakes are washed away by the cross of Calary. And now heaven is rejoicing. My future homes awaiting me. Cuz you step into chaos and bring order. You step into sorrow and bring joy. You send your word and there's healing. The darkness disorder. You step in the sorrow and bring joy. You send your word and there's healing. The darkness dissolves when you speak. Let there be light. Change everything. Let there be light. Change everything. Praise the Lord. Let's stand together as we go to worship the Lord today. How many would say to him, "Lord, step in to the chaos and bring order. bring order in my life. Speak to me today in in a real and living way. God knows your heart. He knows your need. He knows your situation, the situation in your family, your home. Whatever it is, God is able to step right into it &gt;&gt; and bring it to order. &gt;&gt; These are what he spoke to me. words that he gave to me some weeks ago now in the early morning. Gave me the scripture to go with it. Speaking again on it this morning. But as we're praying, as we're speaking, you just talk to the Lord a minute and you just say to him, "God, step in. Step in." Maybe you look at your life say, "Well, it's it's okay." Well, okay is still chaos. &gt;&gt; We want more than okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want the order of God in our lives &gt;&gt; because it's only then we have peace. &gt;&gt; Now, let him speak to you today. Father, in the name of Jesus, we ask your grace upon us, Lord, upon this service, your anointing upon every heart. Thou knowest every person, every situation, Lord, the things that they are going through, the issues that they face. And Lord, like we said, we want our lives to be more than okay. We want it to be in divine order. That if you would call us even at this moment, we would be ready to meet you. For we know not what hour you will call. But we do know, Lord, we're in the last days. And we do know that your word has been held for this moment in this time. And any moment, Lord, light will dawn upon the scriptures that has been laying there dormant in the in the Bible for years. And oh God, it will fulfill things like 1 Thessalonians 4 that we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air. It'll it'll fulfill, oh God, the scripture that speaks out the times of the Gentiles and it coming to an end. But when the bride leaves, the Gentile dispensation is over. Lord, I pray that you'll prepare of a heart. You'll deal with every life. You'll speak to every soul today as we look to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. If you'll turn with me to Genesis chapter 1, we want to read from there. I want to welcome each one of you today in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus. And I hope that you'll feel at home today in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you don't feel at home in his presence, then I pray that there'll be a change in your life so you can. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's really where we want to find our place is in him. Genesis chapter 1 verse one. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. God bless you. You can be seated. When we look at these sky and we see a sermon that's actually preached every night and it's a sermon without words. &gt;&gt; It's a majestic order of God that is written across the sky. is a Bible that is written there. &gt;&gt; And in that heavenly order, not one planet wanders, not one star leaves its predestined path. They lo they move in flawless precision and in a heavenly order. They're keeping time like instruments in in a vast holy symphony. It's the Lord's celestial host. And the psalmist declares, "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold, who hath created these things that bringeth out their host by number." And this is not chaos. It is ordered harmony. For each heavenly body, every star within the galaxy, it all marches together in rank, is held steady by divine decree. The moon knows its place. And the sun does not delay nor does it hurry. A and God himself would ask Job, can thou bind the sweet influence of Plleades or loose the bands of Orian? You see, God's universe is a universe built on order. Each star has its own orbit. Each angel has its own rake. And each being was created with a specific calling. As Isaiah chapter 40 said, he calleth them all by name. Not one faileth. &gt;&gt; And if we just stop and remember, you know, if he would put everything else in order, certainly he wants our lives in divine order. &gt;&gt; That he also knows our name &gt;&gt; and he calls us by name. each one in our own time. And he'll not fail to do that. Not for one, not for one name written in the Lamb's Book of Life. And if the if the moon was to drift from its usual path, we know the earth would be thrown off of balance and and the the tides would become wild and borders would crumble and and waters would flood back over the land, bringing it back to its original chaotic state where the Bible said, "And the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep." Amen. &gt;&gt; Yet that does not happen because creation does not govern itself. It is upheld by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:17 says, "By him all things consist." In other words, they are held together. They are sustained. They are restrained. And it says, "And he is before all things." &gt;&gt; This is the God that we serve. We we serve the one who brings order out of chaos. &gt;&gt; Who speaks boundaries to the sea and gives laws to the heavens. &gt;&gt; AS JEREMIAH WOULD SAY, "THUS saith the Lord, um which giveth the sun for light by day, if those ordinance depart from before me, sayeth the Lord, then the seed of Israel also shall cease." AND THAT SAME VOICE THAT BROUGHT LIGHT OUT OF darkness is still ruling today. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if God can command the galaxies and if he names the stars and if he keeps oceans in their place, he is more than able to step into human confusion &gt;&gt; into broken lives into disordered hearts and once again speak his word and say, "Let there be Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, he's more than able to step into his church, even a church THAT IS DRIFTING AND OUT OF ORDER, and reach out and bring it into order. &gt;&gt; And how will he do this? He will do this the same way he always has. How did he do it in the beginning? And the spirit of God moved. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, it is the moving of the spirit upon those chaotic waters that brought it into order as God said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; I want you to notice the sequence. The spirit of God moves and the word speaks. And when the word speaks, it brings order to lives. It brings order to the earth. AND LIGHT ALWAYS DAWNS WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES. And when it does, it dispels the chaos. &gt;&gt; It removes the confusion. &gt;&gt; It brings divine order. As we live knowing, you know, here, especially here in the south, we it's very noticeable the changing of the seasons as the light decreases and coldness comes and and our the leaves on the trees retreat and vegetation become dormant and and the growth stops and barrenness and unfruitfulness comes. That that all happens because the light has has decreased. But as the light increases, warmth returns, leaves pop out, fruitfulness returns, birds sing and make their nest, and joy returns as the light increases. And it brings a rapturous hour as the bride and the bridegroom unite. &gt;&gt; AND AS THE LIGHT SHINES UPON THE WORD, then the confusion of the dark ages vanish. Isaiah 30 26 is a notable scripture to me. It says, "Moreover, the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun." In other words, the bride will match the groom. &gt;&gt; Amen. That the light of of the bride will be like that of the groom. Notice, AND THEN THE LIGHT OF THE sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days in the day that the Lord bindeth at the breach of his people and health the stroke of their wound. SO IN THE VERY DAY THAT HE BINDETH UP THE BREEZE, THAT HE BRINGS a restoration, THAT HE BRINGS A HEALING TO THE CHURCH, THE LIGHT COMES together as a AS NOT JUST THE LIGHT OF ONE AGE, BUT THE LIGHT OF ALL THE AGES &gt;&gt; COMING TOGETHER, SHINING UPON THE LAST AGE TO BRING TO MANIFESTATION EVER DIVINE PROMISE of God and to heal THE WOMB, TO BIND UP THE BROKEN HEART, TO TO SET THE CAPTIVE FREE TO BRING THOSE THAT ARE IN CHAOS OUT OF CHAOS INTO DIVINE ORDER. WE ALSO NOTICE IN IN REVELATION 10 as THE MIGHTY ANGEL, THE ANOINTING OF THE Holy Ghost as it descends here in this LAST DAY THAT HIS FACE as is as it were the sun shining in his strength. You see, IT IS A TIME WHERE THE THE THE SHADOWS, THE TYPES ALL FLEE AWAY AS THE NEGATIVE BECOMES THE POSITIVE AND THINGS THAT WERE HIDDEN in obscurity come into manifestation. AND THE BOOK OF REVELATION THAT WAS CLOTHED IN MYSTERIES AND SYMBOLS BECOME ILLUMINATED and move from mysterious symbols and parables into visible manifestation. AND UNDER THE LIGHT OF THE MIGHTY ANGEL, THE WORD IS RELEASED, and the book that was once sealed to OTHER AGES IS OPENED and revealed. And mysterious voices of thunder become plainly revealed. Why? Because the spirit of God moved. &gt;&gt; And when HE MOVES, IT ALWAYS SPEAKS A WORD that brings light. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, GOD'S DESIGN FOR HIS people is has always been perfect order. &gt;&gt; It is not confusion, not instability, not spiritual chaos. Let me just tell you, even personally for your own personal life, YOU YOU KNOW, GOD'S DESIRE FOR YOU IS perfect order. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT CONFUSION. IT'S NOT INSTABILITY. IT'S NOT CHAOS. GOD WANTS TO BRING ORDER INTO YOUR LIFE TO bring where where you lived IN UNHOLINESS AND MAKE IT HOLY. WHERE YOU LIVED IN UNGODLINESS AND MAKE IT GODLY. AMEN. TO WHERE that you YOU ARE CHANGED BY THE POWER OF THE NEW CREATION. AND AND AND BECAUSE THE CHURCH HAS NEVER BEEN INTENDED to aim to to drift AIMLESSLY TO BE PULLED OFF ITS COURSE BY EVERY NEW IDEA OR EVERY WIND OF DOCTRINE. THE THE SCRIPTURE warns us plainly about that in Ephesians 4:14 THAT WE ARE NOT TO BE TOSSED uh to and fro cared about every wind of doctrine. THERE IS TO BE CHAOS YOU SEE UPON THE EARTH. BUT GOD COMES TO BRING ORDER INTO THAT CHAOS. &gt;&gt; AND AND ORDER IS NEVER BONDAGE. &gt;&gt; It is protection. &gt;&gt; IT IS THE STABILITY OF THE STABILIZING FORCE OF TRUTH THAT KEEPS THE BODY OF CHRIST ALIGNED WITH THE WILL AND the purpose of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And our lives, our homes, our assemblies, this church this morning is to move in step with the command of the most high God. &gt;&gt; Just as the the heavens do is God told Abraham, "LOOK NOW TOWARD the heavens and TELL THE STARS, SO SHALL THY SEED BE." SO if he put order IN THE HEAVENS, &gt;&gt; HE WANTS order in his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants, you know, as he likens his people to the stars, each one he WANTS THEM PLACED, EACH ONE APPOINTED, EACH ONE SHINING IN HIS in his proper position. AND DANIEL SAID, THE THOSE THAT BE WISE shall shine as the brightness of the firminant, AND THOSE THAT TURN MANY to righteousness as the stars forever and ever. &gt;&gt; You see, stars are not random. They're not random lights scattered in confusion. They are fixed. They are ordered. They're governed by God. &gt;&gt; And there is an ORDER THAT WE MUST REMAIN IN. WE MUST STAY POSITIONED AROUND THE SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Just like THE THE PLANETS IN OUR GALAXY REVOLVE AROUND our son. Even so that we must revolve around the SON OF GOD. EACH one in his place, each one in his orbit. AND TO LEAVE GOD'S word is to bring chaos into your life. TO LEAVE GOD'S PLAN FOR YOUR LIFE is to bring chaos in your life. REMEMBER, ONE STAR OUT OF ORDER WILL BRING CHAOS IN FAMILIES, in churches, IN HOMES. ONE PERSON OUT OF ORDER. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL COME UNDER THE ORDER OF THE HOLY GHOST &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU SEE YOU SEE THAT EVERY ONE OF US YOU KNOW IN order the sen of God and because he said you know that that TO YOU THAT FEAR MY NAME SHALL THE SUN ARISE RIGHTEOUSNESS ARISE WITH HEALING IN HIS WINGS. You see, WHEN WE'RE IN THE PROPER ORDER, THE LIGHT BRINGS HEALING. IT BRINGS DELIVERANCE. IT BRINGS SALVATION. IT IT'LL SAVE THE LOST. IT'LL BRING AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE or young ONE YOUNG CONVERTS CAN BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD. IT'LL BRING AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE MIRACLES CAN HAPPEN, WHERE DELIVERANCE TAKES PLACE BECAUSE YOU ARE THERE IN THE PROPER ORDER AROUND THE SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; NOW, brother Brandham actually preaches these things when and this is part of where that I draw a lot of things that I say this morning in the greatest battle ever fought because he said, I looked at the heavens and I say how that they have stayed in their order. And he said, "If God can order the heavens that way, then he wants to order his church to be in perfect harmony. And if we could get in perfect harmony, there wouldn't be any sick among us, any lost saved, unsaved, right?" Amen. There wouldn't be none. Because why? Because perfect order brings healing. It puts us in position around the son of God. BECAUSE WHEN A PLANET LEAVES ITS ORDER, THEN DISORDER follows immediately. And in the same way when WHEN A BELIEVER STEPS OUT OF SPIRITUAL ALIGNMENT OUT FROM UNDER THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST, it doesn't affect them alone. THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT THIS BODY OF CHRIST and it it is clearly that he said THE BODY IS NOT ONE MEMBER but many. Amen. &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE, WE AFFECT ONE ANOTHER. WE ARE A PART OF ONE BODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. ONE LIFE OUT OF ORDER &gt;&gt; CAN DISRUPT FAMILIES, &gt;&gt; CHURCHES, and entire moves of God. &gt;&gt; Actually, that's so. Amen. A husband out of order, &gt;&gt; OUT OF HIS PLACE, &gt;&gt; OUT OF HIS POSITION CAUSES CHAOS WITHIN THE FAMILY. A WIFE OUT OF HER PLACE, &gt;&gt; OUT OF ORDER BRINGS CHAOS INTO THE FAMILY. CHILDREN, YOUNG PEOPLE, TEENAGERS, OUT OF ORDER BRINGS CHAOS INTO A HOME, INTO A FAMILY and into a church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham tells us, he said, there's where the church is failing today on that walk. Don't you know that even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed? &gt;&gt; Think about that. Your own behavior. How important then it is that we come into the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Where our behavior produces faith &gt;&gt; and not doubt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Your misbehavior of unconfessed sins of you believers can cause this church to bitterly fail. And at the day of judgment, you'll be responsible for every bit of it. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE WHY? BECAUSE GOD IS NOT THE author of confusion, &gt;&gt; but he's THE AUTHOR OF PEACE as in all the churches of the saint. So St. Paul said. So heaven moves by divine order and the church HAS TO MOVE BY THAT SAME ORDER. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY WE MUST CONTINUALLY strive and and I don't mean in the flesh but in submission to as the Bible said TO KEEP THE UNITY OF THE SPIRIT IN THE BOND of peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. MAYBE YOU HAVE AN IDEA AND SOMEBODY ELSE HAS AN IDEA AND and and everybody's got opinion like everyone has noses. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, we should strive to keep the unity of the spirit &gt;&gt; in the bond of peace. Yes. &gt;&gt; And when we STAY IN OUR GODAPP APPOINTED PLACE, when we are yielded to the spirit, WHEN WE ARE CENTERED ON CHRIST, THEN THE WHOLE PROGRAM of God, it flows into harmony. &gt;&gt; It all is a harmonious union working together. But when order is broken, that's when chaos presses in. Therefore, we should walk carefully. We should we should stay should stay in our own spiritual orbit and and shine there. And each one of us exactly where God has placed us. &gt;&gt; You know, really this is adoption. This is maturity. Adoption is is position yourself in the body of Christ. And and of course, you know, as as the talents are shown in the Bible, he gives you some a talent. He gives you uh he gives you a portion, but then he expects that to to grow and to expand. And if you're trustworthy WITH YOU WITH WHAT YOU HAVE, he can give you more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he wants increase. And what you need to look FOR THIS THIS YEAR IN YOUR LIFE IS GOD GIVE ME INCREASE in my life. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about more money in your pocket. &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT A SPIRITUAL increase &gt;&gt; where THAT THAT YOU YOU GAIN HIGHER HEIGHTS that you reach deeper depths THAT YOU KNOW GOD IN A GREATER MORE RICHER MORE FULLER WAY THAN WHAT you have known him in the past. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you AND SO YOU YOU GET IN GOD'S ORDER and and you operate that. If you are a teenager, you have an order of influence around you, &gt;&gt; Amen. You have a gravitational pull and you and others have a pull on you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And what DOES THAT DO? THAT THAT PRESSURE THAT PULL it it it can bring stability or it can bring chaos. Yes. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU'RE PULLED BY ONE WHO'S OUT OF HIS ORBIT, it'll also pull you into chaos. &gt;&gt; That's why you got to choose your friends very wisely. &gt;&gt; Amen. To make sure that you am certain that you're walking in God's ordained path for your life. &gt;&gt; Because God has an ordained path, a predestinated will for every person's life. And you will be a lot happier when you find it and walk in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, TO STEP OUT OF GOD'S APPOINTED place is rebellion. &gt;&gt; And really, THAT'S WHAT SIN IS. &gt;&gt; SIN IS REBELLION AGAINST GOD. &gt;&gt; IT'S IN HIS FACE. I'LL DO WHAT I WANT TO DO. I'll live how I want to live. It is my life. Well, where did you get it? It was given to you by God. &gt;&gt; So it was God's to begin with. &gt;&gt; It's only loan to you. &gt;&gt; Now what will you do with it? &gt;&gt; Every person has to look at their own life. They have to make that decision. AND TO TO STEP OUT OF GOD'S APPOINTED PLACE IS REBELLION. TO LEAVE ONE'S ORDER IS TO DISRUPT HARMONY. AND THAT'S WHY PAUL'S WARNS THAT LET NO man think of himself more highly than he ought to think. &gt;&gt; You see, AND HE APPLIES THE SAME PRINCIPLE to the order of church leadership. I've always found this interesting in in 1 Timothy 3 and six where he talks about the qualification of of leadership in the church. And he says very clearly, "Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride, he fall into condemnation of the devil." &gt;&gt; H I wonder what that is. Let's talk about it for a moment. To step into authority before God places you there is to repeat the original rebellion of Lucifer, &gt;&gt; right? AMEN. THE BIBLE SAID IN 1 CORINTHIANS 12:18, GOD HAS SET THE MEMBERS OF EVERY ONE OF THEM IN THE BODY AS IT PLEASED HIM. &gt;&gt; SO GOD SETS, HE ORDERS THE places and you never WANT TO MOVE OUT OF THE PLACE THAT GOD HAS SET YOU IN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You want to stay right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and there again, you don't move until God moves you. &gt;&gt; You don't force things to happen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A lot of times, you know, young people want to get married and so they force situations to make it work. &gt;&gt; Many times they pray and they pray, "Lord, let this be your will." That's the wrong way to pray. &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, what is your will?" Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you can get God's permissive will &gt;&gt; and to WALK IN HIS PERMISSIVE WILL ALWAYS BRINGS CHAOS. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY WE'RE BORN THE WAY WE'RE BORN. AND WE WERE ALL BORN IN SIN IS BECAUSE OF THE PERMISSIVE WILL &gt;&gt; GIVEN TO OUR FIRST parents &gt;&gt; who left God's perfect will and they chose chaos over divine order. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, SO TO MOVE BEYOND THAT PLACEMENT, WHETHER BY AMBITION or why by self-promotion or or others pushing into there, it's to disrupt harmony. AS BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IT THIS WAY, now everybody can't be a preacher, but you got a voice. &gt;&gt; And if you're a preacher, you're called to the pulpit to preach. &gt;&gt; I wish Jeffersonville would listen to that. we wouldn't have the chaos that's coming out of there &gt;&gt; because if you're a preacher, the prophet said you are called to the pulpit to preach. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE NOT, YOU'RE STILL A PREACHER, &gt;&gt; BUT YOU LIVE THE PEOPLE A SERMON. &gt;&gt; SO, YOU GOT TO REALIZE YOUR LIFE IS AN INFLUENCE. &gt;&gt; YES, it is. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S A PULL UPON OTHERS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And you want to see what kind of influence that you're that you are bringing upon a person's life. &gt;&gt; Are you causing them come closer to Christ or pushing them into rebellion? &gt;&gt; You see, he said, "Let your sermon be lived. It is the voice of God that'll bring the reproach to them who reject it." They said, "No one can put a finger on his or her life, their sweet living. If there ever was a man of God, if that man or that woman, you see, you live your sermon. It It's Don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher. Uh you'll GET IT ALL MIXED UP ANYWAY, MESSED UP, and you'll get people tangled up and you won't KNOW WHAT YOU'LL RUIN THEM AND YOURSELF, TOO. Just live your sermon. &gt;&gt; The preacher is called to preach his and live it, too. AND HE SAYS, "IF YOU CAN'T LIVE IT, THEN stop preaching." &gt;&gt; Amen. You're supposed to live your sermons. &gt;&gt; But you see, often it's pride. Pride places the man a man in the same spiritual position that Lucifer occupied when he fell. &gt;&gt; You Lucifer's fall was the result of selfexaltation. That's right. &gt;&gt; AGAIN, THE FIRST AND FOREMOST OF ALL SIN really comes with, you know, this this word, this phrase, I will. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS WHAT LUCIFER SAID IN THE BEGINNING. I WILL. AND WHEN YOU EXALT YOUR WILL OVER GOD'S WILL, WHICH IS HIS WORD, &gt;&gt; THEN ALWAYS REBELLION HAPPENS. AND GUESS WHAT? IT DON'T JUST AFFECT YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT WITH LUCIFER'S FALL, THERE WERE OTHERS THAT FELL WITH him &gt;&gt; because of the influence. Amen. &gt;&gt; AND EZEKIEL DESCRIBES IT in Ezekiel 28:17. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, and thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness. So you see, when he fell, HE DIDN'T FALL ALONE. IF YOU LOOK WITH ME IN IN Revelation 12:4, and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and it cast them to the earth. &gt;&gt; So, not only did he fall, he caused others to fall, too. &gt;&gt; And those who followed his rebellion shared his judgment, &gt;&gt; and they left their design, their assigned order, and they WERE CAST OUT OF GOD'S PRESENCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO HERE'S THE UNCHANGING TRUTH I WANT TO GET YOU TODAY AND THAT IS GOD'S ORDER brings life. If you remember in the beginning when HE WHAT WAS HE DOING BY BY THE LIGHT HE WAS PRODUCING THE ENERGY to bring all life from &gt;&gt; AND THERE AGAIN SELF-EXALTATION always brings chaos &gt;&gt; and so Lucifer he broke divine order how by seeking God's place &gt;&gt; do you notice he says in Isaiah Isaiah that he says it like this. You know, I will exalt myself above the sons of God. &gt;&gt; I WILL BE LIKE THE MOST HIGH. &gt;&gt; WELL, we all want to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; But that ain't what he was saying. &gt;&gt; I want to take his place. &gt;&gt; I want his position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want the worship that belongs to him. And he's he broke that divine order. AND HE'S BEEN TRYING EVER SINCE TO REPRODUCE THE SAME DISORDER AMONG GOD'S people &gt;&gt; by tempting MEN TO LEAVE THEIR CALLINGS TO SEEK PRO PROMINENCE TO TO DRAW WORSHIP TO THEMSELVES. But all of heaven AND THOSE WHO DWELL IN HEAVENLY PLACES, THEY'LL ALL STILL STAND AS GOD DESIGNED IT. EVER BEING IN HIS PLACE, EVERY VOICE IN HARMONY WITH THE WORD OF GOD, AND EVERY CROWN CAST at his feet. &gt;&gt; And that's the lesson we want to learn from this today is that we want to stay in God's appointed order &gt;&gt; because that's life. Amen. &gt;&gt; AND EXALT OURSEL is to repeat the oldest re rebellion in the universe as a and and and we want we want God's order not the disorder that Satan brings. &gt;&gt; So you see rebellion is a sin. IT DOESN'T MATTER. GOD PLACES headship in your life. &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD PLACES HEADSHIP IN your life. He puts a A MAN UNDER CHRIST. CHRIST is his head. &gt;&gt; MEN OF GOD, THE WORD OF GOD IS YOUR HEAD. &gt;&gt; FOR THE FAMILY, EVEN FOR THE WIFE, THE CHILDREN, THE WORD OF GOD IS STILL THE HEAD. &gt;&gt; BUT PRIMARILY THE MAN STANDS IN THAT PLACE OF RESPONSIBILITY. CHRIST AS HIS HEAD, HIS WORDGIVEN preeminence &gt;&gt; over his own reasoning, OVER HIS OWN THOUGHTS, OVER HIS OWN AMBITIONS, OVER HIS own desires, &gt;&gt; he puts the word first, &gt;&gt; and I'll tell you what, the quicker you learn to seek first &gt;&gt; the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; and its righteousness, &gt;&gt; the quicker you learn that, the more that you will have the things the right things added to you. I want a wife. I want a husband. I want a family. I want I want wealth. I WANT THIS. I WANT THAT. IT COMES FROM WHERE? SEEKING FIRST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God, that's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many times have I preached to you? THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO SEEK FIRST THE HOLY GHOST &gt;&gt; AND HIS DIVINE ORDER IN YOUR LIFE &gt;&gt; AND then in his time everything &gt;&gt; will be added to you. &gt;&gt; BUT TO STEP OUT OF GOD'S APPOINTED way &gt;&gt; will bring disorder in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll bring confusion, hurt, harm, sorrow because that's all the wages that sin pays. &gt;&gt; So you see, the scripture tells us AS WE STARTED OFF IN GENESIS 1:2, THE EARTH WAS WITHOUT FORM AND VOID, AND darkness was upon the face of the deep. At that point, it wasn't suitable for life. IT WAS SHAPELESS. IT WAS EMPTY. It was covered in darkness. &gt;&gt; You know, there's times that things ain't just suitable for life. &gt;&gt; Young man, until you get the Holy Ghost, you're not suitable for life. That's right. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN STEP OUT of order and go ahead and get you a wife and you'll find one out of your own desires and you'll eat the fruits of it. &gt;&gt; Young lady, THE SAME THING. YOU STEP OUT OF GOD'S ORDER. And God's order is his word. So, you want someone with a holy taste, WITH A WITH A WITH A DESIRE FOR GOD, WITH WITH A HUNGER FOR HIM AND AND AND GOD IS HIS HEAD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO YOU SEE WHEN IT WAS WHEN THIS when the IN GENESIS 1 THE EARTH WAS WITHOUT FORM IT WAS VOID. DARKNESS WAS ON THE FACE OF THE DEEP. IT WASN'T suitable for life. This is what you want. You want to get your life in order. &gt;&gt; So it is suitable for life. &gt;&gt; At that point THE EARTH WAS SHAPELESS, EMPTY, COVERED IN DARKNESS. BUT I WANT YOU TO NOTICE THIS. IT WASN'T abandoned &gt;&gt; and it wasn't forgotten. &gt;&gt; And I want you to KNOW EVEN IN WHEREVER YOU ARE TODAY, YOU ARE NOT FORGOTTEN &gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE not abandoned. &gt;&gt; OH NO. OH NO. WE LISTEN. GOD SEES THE DISORDER &gt;&gt; AND HE'S GOT THE RIGHT MOVEMENT &gt;&gt; AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES &gt;&gt; LIGHT SPRINGS UP &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORD SPEAKS &gt;&gt; AND THEN THE PATH BECOMES ILLUMINATED THEN YOU CAN WALK IN THAT light &gt;&gt; and in that light is health is healing is restoration &gt;&gt; is mercy Yes, &gt;&gt; but there chaos was present. But so was the spirit. &gt;&gt; And this is always God's pattern. When disorder exists, the spirit moves. &gt;&gt; And sometimes YOU THINK THE CHAOS CAN'T GET ANY WORSE. And I'll tell you, you don't want it to. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU DON'T WANT IT TO. WHAT YOU WANT IS GOD TO STEP INTO YOUR CHAOS &gt;&gt; AND LET HIS SPIRIT MOVE. &gt;&gt; LET IT BRING ILLUMINATION TO WHERE YOU'RE AT. &gt;&gt; And let IT BEGIN TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE AND TRANSFORM YOU LIKE IT DID THE EARTH UNTIL IT BECAME A GARDEN OF EDEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; A place where God could meet with his sons and daughters, &gt;&gt; where he could bring life and joy and peace. And this is where what God does. He moves. He doesn't move to destroy. He moves to prepare it, to bring it to divine order. And God isn't out to destroy your life. He is there to bring it in order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; OH, NOW MAYBE IT MIGHT DESTROY THE SIN IN YOUR LIFE, &gt;&gt; BUT IN DOING SO, IT'LL BRING ORDER, &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THAT ORDER WILL BRING PEACE AND THAT ORDER WILL BRING HARMONY. AND THAT ORDER WILL BRING JOY NOT JUST TO YOU BUT YES TO YOU PRIMARILY BUT TO ALL AROUND YOU. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID IF A MAN'S WAYS PLEASE THE LORD THAT EVEN HIS enemies will be at peace with him. &gt;&gt; So this is where God brings order out of chaos. As the world was then, it could not sustain life. It was uninhabitable. But then came the turning point of all history. And the spirit of God moved. &gt;&gt; And when he moves, HE RELEASED A WORD. &gt;&gt; AND THAT WORD SAID, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND I TELL YOU, WHEN THE DAY STAR, THE LIGHT SHINES INTO A DARKENED SOUL, &gt;&gt; IT'LL TRANSFORM IT FROM SOMETHING THAT IS IN UPHEAVAL AND ON A PATH MEANT FOR DESTRUCTION AND A WORLD THAT IS FILLED WITH WITH EVIL and turn it AROUND AND MAKE A SON OR DAUGHTER OF GOD OUT AND PUT YOU IN ORBIT AROUND HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AMEN. where the sun of righteousness can shine on your life and bring healing &gt;&gt; with the wings of the morning as it dawns &gt;&gt; on your life. And God said because every time God speaks, he brings order. &gt;&gt; When God gives his word, he sends a message. And it's always to confront confusion. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, that's why God sent a message in this day. &gt;&gt; It was sent to confront confusion. &gt;&gt; AND TO RESTORE DIVINE ALIGNMENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THIS IS WHY HE SENT THE MESSAGE IN THE END time to bring a people INTO DIVINE ORDER FOR WHAT? A RAPTURE. YEAH. &gt;&gt; TO GET YOU UP &gt;&gt; out of this WORLD OF CHAOS. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORLD WE LIVE IN IS GOING TO BURN WITH IN UN INQUENCHABLE FIRE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT THERE IS A PEOPLE THAT WILL BE CAUGHT UP INTO ORBIT AROUND HIM &gt;&gt; WHO WILL BE SAVED FROM THE WRATH THAT IS TO COME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And the Bible tells you in Psalms 33:6, "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made." And I'll tell you, by the word of the Lord, the heavens are made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. &gt;&gt; For when his word is spoken, light appears. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Every time his word comes, light comes. As it said, LET THERE BE LIGHT AND THERE was light. LIGHT ALWAYS DISPELS THE DARKNESS. IT EXPOSES THAT WHICH WAS HIDDEN. IT SHINES A LIGHT ON THE HIDDEN TACTICS OF THE DEVIL. It separates truth from confusion. SO THAT PEOPLE WHO SAT IN THE REGIONS of the shadow of death see a great light &gt;&gt; and they come out of that death &gt;&gt; in the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what Isaiah declared. The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light. You see darkness in the scripture is a darkness in scripture is not the absence of imp information. We all have Bibles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But darkness in scripture is the absence of revelation. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND. THEY SAY, "WELL, WE GOT THE BIBLE. WHAT DO WE NEED RESTORATION FOR?" WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT needed to be RESTORED WAS THE REVELATION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT DID WE HAVE? WE HAD WE HAD 40,000 DENOMINATIONAL INTERPRETATIONS. &gt;&gt; And we NEED TO KNOW WHAT GOD SAID &gt;&gt; ABOUT THIS SUBJECT, &gt;&gt; NOT FILTER THROUGH WHAT MAN SAYS. &gt;&gt; Because man always does like Eve did in the beginning. And Satan as he comes and questions the word, the serpent to Eve, &gt;&gt; ye hath God said, to twist &gt;&gt; what God said. &gt;&gt; So you see that's why God's word does more than inform the mind. It comes to transform the life. &gt;&gt; God wants to do more for you people than give you an education in the Bible. &gt;&gt; He wants to transform your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I MEAN, WE GOT THEOLOGIANS SITTING ON MESSAGE PEWS EVERYWHERE. WE'VE MADE THEOLOGIANS OUT OF THEM. THEY KNOW THIS AND THEY KNOW THAT AND THEY UNDERSTAND THIS. BUT DO THEY KNOW GOD? &gt;&gt; WE GOT PEOPLE WHO CAN UNDERSTAND CONCEPTS AND SAY IT ALL MAKES SENSE. IT ALL MAKES SENSE AND IT'S SENSIBLE AND IT'S REASONABLE. BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT IT BEING SENSIBLE AND REASONABLE. IT'S ABOUT TRANSFORMING, &gt;&gt; changing you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it don't start with just one glory. It's from glory to glory &gt;&gt; that he changes you. &gt;&gt; So when God speaks, his word cuts through the darkness. &gt;&gt; It exposes what's been hidden. &gt;&gt; IT CALLS THE PEOPLE OUT OF confusion and to his marvelous light. Yes. &gt;&gt; This is what Peter said. You know, HE HATH CALLED YOU OUT OF DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; HE CALLED YOU OUT OF THE CONFUSION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE CALLED YOU OUT OF THAT CHAOS. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT HE WAS DOING TO THE EARTH. HE WAS CALLING THE EARTH WITH THAT WAS DARK WITHOUT FORM AND DARKNESS COVERED THE FACES. HE WAS CALLING IT OUT OF CHAOS &gt;&gt; INTO THE marvelous light. So the light could bring forth the purpose, &gt;&gt; the plan of God. &gt;&gt; So every time God speaks, every time God sends a message, order is restored. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Confusion gives way to clarity and turmoil will give way to peace. And wandering gives away to direction. Because why? The word is a a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path. &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID WHEN WHEN GOD STEPPED INTO OUR CHAOS HERE IN THE LEODYSIAN AGE OF CHRIST REJECTING AGE AND HE STEPPED INTO THE CHAOS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? TRUTH THAT HAD BEEN BURIED under misunderstandings and misapplications is suddenly made plain. For by the Bible said, "At the appointed time, the vision shall speak." &gt;&gt; God had an appointed time for the vision to speak. &gt;&gt; God held a whole book of revelation. Come on, somebody. For an end time people &gt;&gt; so the vision would speak to them &gt;&gt; TO DO WHAT? TO BRING THEM OUT OF CONFUSION. &gt;&gt; TO SHINE A LIGHT OF GOD ON GLORIOUS TRUTH. TO BRING A TRANSFORMATION IN YOUR LIFE. TO TAKE YOU FROM JUST A RELIGIOUS CHURCH MEMBER AND TRANSFORM YOU INTO A SON OR DAUGHTER OF GOD AND MAKE YOU A PART OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; That's what he does. &gt;&gt; What looked chaotic is simply waiting for the right moment for God to bring it to order. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I want I want you just to even think about the chaos in your life. What looks chaotic is simply waiting for that right moment &gt;&gt; for divine encounter. &gt;&gt; Amen. For him to pass by your way &gt;&gt; as he did the woman at the well. &gt;&gt; Waiting for that right moment for God to bring it to order. Amen. &gt;&gt; Take that just for a MOMENT &gt;&gt; AND THINK ABOUT YOUR PRODALS &gt;&gt; AND THE CHAOTIC CONDITION THAT THEY'RE IN AND HOW MUCH MORE OF A MESS CAN THEY GET THEIR LIVES IN. WE DON'T WANT to know how much more. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, what looks chaotic is simply waiting for the right moment &gt;&gt; for God to bring it into order. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. I I I LOOK UPON THE FACE OF MEN AND WOMEN AND I CAN CALL YOU ONE BY ONE AND ONE BY ONE AND LOOK AT SEEING LIVES THAT WERE IN CHAOS. &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS JUST WAITING FOR THAT RIGHT MOMENT &gt;&gt; FOR THE SPIRIT OF GOD TO MOVE. AND WHEN HE MOVED, HE BROUGHT LIGHT INTO A DARKENED SOUL. AND HE CHANGED AND TRANSFORMED YOU. &gt;&gt; That's the power of the new creation. &gt;&gt; That's the power of the blood. &gt;&gt; You know, this is what happened when God's word came to Luther. The scripture had already been there. He didn't go and find a new Bible. He didn't go and write a a a new verse in it &gt;&gt; and say, "I tell you what, I want to change this. The Catholics have got me there. We're doing this penance and we're paying for souls out of purgatory and we're we're burning candles that we have to pay for to to to get sins remitted and all kinds OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON." &gt;&gt; BUT THE SCRIPTURE HAD ALWAYS BEEN THERE. &gt;&gt; YES. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; But that DAY, THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED. &gt;&gt; And when IT DID, IT SHONE LIGHT ON A WORD. &gt;&gt; AND THAT WORD BEGAN TO TRANSFORM THE CHURCH. THAT WORD WAS THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But it had been buried beneath creeds and systems that taught salvation by works. But when God illuminated that word, light broke through centuries of darkness. &gt;&gt; Faith was restored in order to return where chaos had once ruled. &gt;&gt; The same pattern followed when when God spoke through Wesley. &gt;&gt; Light shown on truth that that God is holy and that he calls his people to live holy lives. Be ye holy, for I am holy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That truth had not disappeared from the scripture. &gt;&gt; It's right there. First Peter 1:16, you can put it up for all to see. THAT TRUTH HAD NOT DISAPPEARED FROM SCRIPTURE. IT WAS ALWAYS THERE. But it had been neglected. BUT WHEN GOD BREATHED ON IT, &gt;&gt; WHEN HE BREATHED ON IT AGAIN, HEARTS WERE AWAKENED AND LIVES WERE CHANGED AND HOLINESS WAS RESTORED TO ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE. &gt;&gt; You see, this is God's way. His word doesn't change. &gt;&gt; And when he sends a message, we don't need to rewrite the Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Neither do we need a 23rd chapter. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. To the book of Revelation. We don't need an additional CHAPTER &gt;&gt; TO WRITE OUR REVELATIONS IN. &gt;&gt; NO, SIR. THE WORD DOESN'T CHANGE. BUT WHAT CHANGES IS OUR ABILITY TO SEE IT. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE BRINGS LIGHT &gt;&gt; AND NOTHING CAN SEE WITHOUT LIGHT. AND WHENEVER LIGHT COMES, DARKNESS MUST FLEE. AND WHEN THE DARKNESS FLEES, DIVINE ORDER IS ONCE AGAIN ESTABLISHED. &gt;&gt; That's why a message from God was needed in this end time. &gt;&gt; A messenger sent from the presence of God, stepped into our world to bring us out of chaos. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to know, friends, God not only showed his love 2,000 years ago, but he has reconfirmed his love to a generation &gt;&gt; that he will not let us remain in darkness. God sent a messenger and a messenger, an angel stepped into our world to bring us out of CHAOS THAT WAS CAUSED BY YEARS of misinterpreted theology. &gt;&gt; Think about it. You know, AS THE ANGEL APPEARED TO MARY, HIS message to her was was, "Greetings, Mary. You're highly favored of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU RECEIVING A MESSAGE IN THIS DAY MEANS YOU ARE HIGHLY FAVORED. &gt;&gt; Chosen of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. For a purpose. &gt;&gt; BUT THE ONLY WAY TO BRING THAT ORDER OUT IS FOR THE Holy Ghost to overshadow you. &gt;&gt; So that that holy thing that is born of you is not of a denomination or of man. but of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So there in Genesis as God continued to speak, life unfolded into divine order. First it was just simple forms. You know it was light and then was separation because anytime light comes separation follows. That's right. &gt;&gt; The darkness flees. &gt;&gt; It retreats and then you know as as it went went from there and land appeared and so ON AND THEN PLANT LIFE AND then living creatures. YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS was the result of THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVING. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND WORD BEING RELEASED, A MESSAGE BEING RELEASED FROM the spirit &gt;&gt; that brought light. &gt;&gt; That's right. A word brought light. Let there be light. &gt;&gt; So the first thing out of God was the logos of God, the pillar of fire. And from that all creation begins. &gt;&gt; That's why he is before all things. And by him all things are created that were created. And so it BEGAN TO BRING FORTH PLANT LIFE, living creatures. And then each stage would build upon the last moving steadily because God has a design &gt;&gt; and God has a purpose. You may remember a message that and and this is going way back maybe back uh 25 years where I preached to you on on on um on God's purpose and God's crowning achievement. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE GOD HAS A A CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT THERE. THERE'S an achievement that he is a design that he has a plan that he has in mind. and and every time that he moves, he he he looks on it and and he says, "That's good, but I got more," &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; WHEN WHEN THE LIGHT DAWN AND AND UPON LUTHER, God looked on it and said, "That's good. The just shall live by faith." &gt;&gt; And that was good. &gt;&gt; But God wasn't through. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; He had more to bring up &gt;&gt; to restore order. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God would would say, "Let there be light." And and then he would say he would see the manifestation and he say that's good. And then that order produced goodness. But you know chaos never does. And finally, God reaches his crowning act of creation. &gt;&gt; If you'll turn with me to Genesis 1:26, you'll see it. And God said, now this SAME ONE THAT SAID, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE SAME ONE. THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED. NOW THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS BRINGING LIGHT UPON ALL HIS PURPOSE OF WHAT HE wanted to bring &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID LET US MAKE MAN AFTER OUR likeness and let them have dominion. So you see this was God's crowning achievement &gt;&gt; to finally REPRODUCE HIMSELF ON THE EARTH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let let me tell YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT GOD HAS DONE IN YOUR LIFE, IT MAY BE WONDERFUL, BUT UNTIL UNTIL HE reproduces his likeness. &gt;&gt; AMEN. UNTIL HE COMES WITH THE INDDWELLING OF HIS HOLY SPIRIT, &gt;&gt; UNTIL HE PRODUCES A CROWNED ACHIEVEMENT, &gt;&gt; don't give up on the plan OF GOD AND GO BACK INTO CHAOS. DON'T RECEIVE BACK INTO DARKNESS. IT ONLY PROVES YOU ARE OF DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. LET HIM THAT STOLE STEAL NO MORE. LET HIM THAT COMMITTED ADULTERY DO IT NO MORE. PUT BEHIND YOU THE THE WORKS OF DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; Seek the Lord with all your heart. &gt;&gt; Serve him with everything you have within you. &gt;&gt; Why? because God wants to add to that. And I'll tell you, I'll tell you, after 6,000 years, God is finally reaching his crowning act of creation. &gt;&gt; As the last age reveals himself as the beginning of the creation of God, &gt;&gt; what creation is that? is a bride, a people in his image that's after his likeness. So what you're seeing right here as the earth came to this point, to this apex, TO THIS CAPSTONE, EVEN SO GOD IS DOING NOW WITH ALL OF WHAT HE'S DONE SINCE HE CREATED the world. He didn't create the world so we could go and mess it UP AND BRING CHAOS AND SIN AND UNBELIEF ON IT. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE DID IT FOR. HE CREATED A WORLD WHERE THAT HE COULD BRING FORTH HIS LIKENESS. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE GOD WANTED A FAMILY. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS WHAT GOD'S ACHIEVEMENT IS. HIS ACHIEVEMENT is not a Lutheran church OR A METHODIST CHURCH OR A PENTECOSTAL CHURCH. GOD'S CROWN AND ACHIEVEMENT WILL BE A BRIDE WITHOUT SPOT OR WRINKLE. A PEOPLE IN HIS IMAGE, A PEOPLE OF HIS LIKENESS, &gt;&gt; a people who moves as he moves, WHO IS IN ORBIT AROUND HIM, WHO IS AHEAD, WHO GIVES him the preeminence. &gt;&gt; So you see, let me even tell you, God's done great things in this day. He sent a message, but the message is not his achievement. God sent a prophet, but his prophet is not what he was trying to achieve. &gt;&gt; That's what message people get confused about. They think it's about a prophet. Is not about a prophet. &gt;&gt; It's about a bride. &gt;&gt; AND IT IS A ABOUT ABOUT A PROPHET BECOMING HIS VOICE. IT'S ABOUT A BRIDE BECOMING HIS VOICE. GOD WANTS MORE THAN ONE MAN IN HIS HAND. HE WANTS EVERY ONE OF YOU IN HIS HAND. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO BE THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE. &gt;&gt; To be the people of his likeness, &gt;&gt; to be a people in his image. &gt;&gt; So is so you see when we look at man, man's not an accident of chaos. Like the evolutionists say, &gt;&gt; some chaotic thing happened, chemicals mixed and this happened and this grew out of that and that spawned this and this happened there and this, you know, it was just chaos &gt;&gt; that produced this. But man is not the accident of chaos. &gt;&gt; He's the result of order. &gt;&gt; And so is God's bride in the end time. Somebody with me now. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's right in the end times. She is no accident. &gt;&gt; I don't know. YOU KNOW, I'M FOURTH IN MY FAMILY AND I don't know my my my PARENTS MAY NOT HAVE PLANNED ME TO come after so many. You quit planning. You plan to have children. One, two. I'm number four. Maybe I wasn't planned, but I'm not an accident. &gt;&gt; They may not have planned me, &gt;&gt; but God planned me. &gt;&gt; AND I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR BIRTH CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I DON'T CARE EVEN THE SIN AND THE CHAOS THAT YOU CAME OUT OF. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE GOD IS A GOD WHO WILL LOOK RIGHT DOWN IN CHAOS AND BRING ORDER OUT OF IT. &gt;&gt; AND HE KNOWS HOW TO FIND EVERY PREDESTINATED SEA, EVEN IF THEY GET AS MESSED UP AS THE WOMAN AT THE WELL WAS. Because Satan would do everything he could to bring such DARKNESS UPON HER LIFE AND FILE SIN UPON SIN UPON SIN AND EVEN RELIGIOUS UNBELIEF UPON HER LIFE AND BRING HER LIFE INTO SUCH CHAOS THAT SURELY GOD WOULD NEVER FIND HER. BUT HE HAD NEED A DIVINE APPOINTMENT &gt;&gt; TO GO BY HER WAY. And I'll tell you, he's no less that God today who will go out of his way to find you, to deliver you, to save you, TO SANCTIFY YOU, TO HEAL YOU, TO PUT YOU IN ORDER AROUND HIMSELF BECAUSE SHE'S A GOD THAT BRINGS order &gt;&gt; and his bride in the end time, she is no accident. &gt;&gt; God has been building for seven church ages until he will have a bride who he says will be complete entire lacking nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she will be in his very image, &gt;&gt; bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh. She will be him reproduced in bright form. God formed man deliberately. And when he did, he did something he did not do for any other creature. Genesis 2:7, he breathed into his nostrils &gt;&gt; the breath of life. And man became a living soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HERE WAS GOD NOW BRINGING HERE THE THE THE EDEX THE TOP THE CAPSTONE OF HIS CREATION. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS NOT COMPLETE THOUGH IT WAS IN HIS LIKENESS. SO HIS FORM IN HIS IMAGE IT WAS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL HE BREATHED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAME INTO ADAM, HE BECAME A LIVING SOUL. &gt;&gt; You see, life reached its highest expression when God shared his own breath with it, &gt;&gt; his own life. And that's what God has done. And I want you to understand, it is not enough to be formed into the likeness of an orderly church and be lifeless. &gt;&gt; Brother Tim, God has sent a message in this day and has formed a people in his image. It's got to do more than just produce a likeness of orderly. &gt;&gt; It's got to be God breathed. &gt;&gt; Do you know that's why after all of these ages the token comes the literal life of Jesus Christ. Not a jump, not a shout, not a justification, not a sanctification, but the very person of Christ, &gt;&gt; his breath. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; His own life. ENTERED INTO A BODY. &gt;&gt; NOW, so once again, as the pattern continu continues, life has reached his highest expression AS GOD IS SHARING HIS OWN BREATH, HIS OWN LIFE, AND THE HOLY GHOST IS BREATHING LIFE INTO A BRIDE. AND SHE'S BECOMING ALIVE WITH HIS POWER AS A PEOPLE TO DO WHAT? TO MANIFEST his life. And this this principle is God's eternal one where the spirit of God moves. And when he moves, the word speaks. And when the word speaks, light appears. And when light appears, life follows. &gt;&gt; And God brought order out of chaos then. And he still does it today. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT NO MATTER HOW HOW MUCH TROUBLE THAT WE GET IN, NO MATTER HOW FAR WE GO ALONG, no matter HOW STILL things seem to be or how how out OF ORDER OR CHAOTIC THINGS BE, God has not left his purpose. &gt;&gt; He will have a people in his image &gt;&gt; who he will share his own life with. And God brought order out of chaos then and HE STILL DOES TODAY. &gt;&gt; WHETHER IN CREATION, WHETHER IN the church, whether in a human heart, WHEN GOD SPEAKS, DARKNESS MUST RETREAT. &gt;&gt; CONFUSION MUST YIELD AND LIGHT MUST RISE. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THIS IS THE POWER OF THE WORD. THIS IS THE NATURE OF GOD. HE IS STILL THE ONE WHO STEPS INTO THE VOID, &gt;&gt; who says, "Let there be." Oh, brother. Amen. I I pray today is a divine appointment for many in this building today &gt;&gt; and where you can have an encounter with God where the spirit of God moves. And as he moves, amen, into your chaos and he speaks a word AND THAT WORD BRINGS A LIGHT &gt;&gt; INTO YOUR LIFE AND DISPELS THE DARKNESS AND SATAN flees &gt;&gt; and victories are won &gt;&gt; and healing begins &gt;&gt; and restoration BEGINS &gt;&gt; UNTIL YOU FINALLY COME TO THAT COVETED PLACE WHERE YOU REACH THE APEX OF PEOPLE IN HIS IMAGE FILLED WITH HIS BREATH. his breath so you can speak &gt;&gt; as he speaks. &gt;&gt; This is what God did by sending a message. He stepped into the void into the emptiness of churchity and to religion and he brought a word and that word brought illumination. For when the word speaks, it says, "Let there be light." And we a people who sat in darkness saw a great light. And that light brought truth that lay in obscurity into revelation. &gt;&gt; Let's look here in second Peter 1:19. As you turn there with me just for a moment, we also have a more sure word of prophecy. And and I I think about that after divine vindication after God PROVEN IT OVER AND OVER and over of the validity of this message and his messenger. WE ALSO HAVE A MORE sure &gt;&gt; word of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where to you do well that you take heed. In other words, it do you well to listen to it &gt;&gt; AS UNTIL LIGHT THAT SHINETH IN A DARK PLACE UNTIL THE DAY DAWN AND THE DAY STAR arise in your heart. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you this is what happens when salvation come. That day when the woman at the well met the s so of God. Amen. That light sprung right down into her soul. It was a light shining in a dark place. &gt;&gt; And it brought the dawning of a new day &gt;&gt; and the because the day star that's the sun rose in her heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And when he rises in her heart, it never sets. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. IT NEVER GOES BACK INTO DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE ARISES IN YOUR HEART AND HE QUICKENS THAT SEED ON THE INSIDE, IT'LL NEVER RETREAT BACK INTO DARKNESS AGAIN. IT'S SEALED into the day of redemption. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now know this first." So I guess get something a knowledge we get first that no prophecy of the scripture is a private interpretation &gt;&gt; that excludes every theologian &gt;&gt; that puts out every one of the 40 40,000 denominational systems there is &gt;&gt; no scripture no prophecy of the scripture is subject to their own interpretation. It's not for them to interpret. &gt;&gt; Theologians can't figure it out. &gt;&gt; KNOW THIS FIRST. &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURE IS NOT SUBJECT TO TEACHERS. &gt;&gt; And men who want to twist it, make it the way they want it to be. &gt;&gt; That's true. Now, it's not subject to private interpretation. It's not even subject to my interpretation &gt;&gt; or yours. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't think it means that. I don't know who you are, &gt;&gt; but I has certainly become a very big person. &gt;&gt; And when you look at the word sin, I is in the center of it. BUT IF YOU'LL EVER GET BORN again &gt;&gt; and change that to an O, then the son will be &gt;&gt; the center. &gt;&gt; When you BECOME NOTHING, WHAT YOU THINK, WHAT YOU ah what I THINK FOR WHAT I WANT FOR MY LIFE, WHAT I DESIRE, I'll tell you what, that leads to sin. &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; Because it's I. You see, WE'VE GOT A WORLD TODAY THAT IS FILLED WITH EYE DISEASE. &gt;&gt; I I will I will exalt. I will do I will have my own way. I will do what I want. I It's all about me. It's I I I I disease. &gt;&gt; Many people's got it. And you got to come to where your thoughts mean zero &gt;&gt; because your thoughts are not his thoughts &gt;&gt; and your ways are not his ways. &gt;&gt; His word is his thoughts. &gt;&gt; And it's not subject to private interpretation. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach now. &gt;&gt; So now eye disease. Yeah. It reminds me of a story My father-in-law told me, oh, brother Buts, many years ago, he told me a story. He said, of um about there was a couple of ducks or geese in a pond up north. And the geese looked over at one another. So, well, boy, it's getting cold. There's ice forming on the pond. We got to leave from here. We'll freeze here. There's an old turtle stuck his head up and said, "What about me? Leave me here. I'll die." So, well, I'm sorry. You don't have wings. You can't go. So, well, I'll tell you what I what you do. You grab you a stick. I'll grab a stick. I'll hold on to it in the middle. You just get a hold of it on either side. Pick me up and take me with you. And I'll enjoy the sunny south. I'll live, not die. Well, that's a clever idea. So, they got a So, they got a stick. Turtle got his mouth, held on to it. Geese took on each side. They got way up high, maybe mile or so high. After they got up high, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS ANOTHER FLOCK OF GEESE COME FLYING BY AND SAID, "HEY, THAT'S A CLEVER IDEA THERE. WHO THOUGHT about who thought of that?" And the turtle said, "Ah, dear." You see, it's so much for about me. &gt;&gt; I But when you change that three-letter word of sin &gt;&gt; and you become nothing, then you become a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; SO KNOW THIS VERSE. NO SCRIPTURE IS A PRIVATE INTERPRETATION. So no prophecy, no scripture is a private interpretation. NO THEOLOGIAN, NO DOCTOR, divinity has a right to interpret. INTERPRETATION BELONGS TO GOD ALONE. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would preach a sermon. God is his own interpreter. &gt;&gt; And of course, let me tell you how that comes. Verse 21. And the prophecy came not in all time by the will of man in a synagogue by the rabbis. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BY THEOLOGIANS FIGURING IT OUT. &gt;&gt; COME ON. THAT'S NOT HOW IT CAME. THE PROPHECY DID NOT COME IN OLD TIME BY THE WILL OF MAN, BUT HOLY MEN OF GOD SPAKE &gt;&gt; AS THEY WERE MOVED BY THE HOLY GHOST. That's why we believe in prophetic revelation &gt;&gt; instead of seminary. &gt;&gt; Now as we look at this, Eden was a place of perfect divine order. It was a creation exactly as God intended. Life was in harmony, authority rightly placed. Peace was governing every relationship. There was no fear. There was no violence. There was no death. And God said, saw of everything that he made, and behold, it was very good. And in that ordered world, creation lived without fear, without without hostility. It was actually no fear. The lion would lay down by the lamb. You know, Isaiah would gave a prophetic picture of that original harmony. He said, "The lion shall eat straw like the bullock." and and Eden Eden reflected God's nature. It was peaceful. It was balanced. It was lifegiven. But Satan, the one WHO HAD ALREADY BROKEN GOD'S ORDER in heaven, came to earth with the same agenda. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that he came as an angel of light. &gt;&gt; And this is the way he ALWAYS COMES. HE DIDN'T COME WITH VIOLENCE, &gt;&gt; you know. He He DIDN'T COME WITH GUNS BLAZING AND CANNONS and and conquering Eden. That's not the way he did it. He entered in with deception. &gt;&gt; He questioned God's word. He challenged God's leadership, his headship, and he offered an al alternate order. one that was centered on himself and said, "Yay, had God said?" And the moment God's word was doubted, that's when order begin to collapse. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what happens. &gt;&gt; That's why many people fall so short of salvation. Somewhere along the line, they quit believing and start doubting. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO THROUGH DECEPTION, Edom was turned into chaos and sinner sin entered and fellowship was broken AND DEATH FOLLOWED AND AND THE BIBLE SAID BY ONE MAN sin entered into THE WORLD AND DEATH BY SIN. SO WHAT BEGAN IN harmony became conflict. AND WHAT WAS PEACE NOW BECAME FEAR. And man now hid from God. And and and it caused all creation to groan. BECAUSE WHEN MAN THE HEAD OF THE EARTH FELL, the earth fell with it. Everything beneath him. And then we will have one of the first visible fruits of that disorder appears in the next generation when Cain killed Abel. &gt;&gt; Now in the beginning there was there in the heavens everything moved in perfect order and harmony with God. Nothing was out of alignment. It functioned in absolute continuity with the creator. God said saw everything that was good that he had made and and it was very good. The stars, the galaxies, the solar systems, they all continue the same divine order today. For the scripture said he holdeth all things up by the word of his power. And we know that if one heavenly body moved out of its ordained place, IT WOULD DISRUPT THE ENTIRE PROGRAM. &gt;&gt; One interruption would despoil the whole order. And the same principle applied on the earth. As long as man lived in continuity with God, one man and one woman UNDER GOD'S WORD, LIFE FLOWED UNHINDERED. BUT WHEN EVE STEPPED OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARY OF GOD'S WORD, THE CONTINUITY WAS broken and the scripture plainly recorded it SAYS YAY HATH GOD SAID. SO ONE WORD WAS QUESTIONED AND ONE alteration accepted AND THE ENTIRE PROGRAM OF GOD FELL OUT OF ALIGNMENT WITH GOD. AND THAT'S WHY THE SCRIPTURE, you know, it it presents the word in such an uncompromising way to add to it or take from it. It's never harmless. The Bible SAID, "YOU SHALL NOT ADD UNTO THE WORD which I COMMAND YOU OR DIMINISH OFF FROM IT." YOU GOT TO STAY RIGHT WITH THAT WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU CAN'T DIMINISH FROM IT. THE MOMENT ONE word was rejected, let me JUST SAY IT. THE MOMENT ONE word is rejected, &gt;&gt; a person, a family or church is thrown out of comm continuity with God &gt;&gt; because Jesus made it clear that the only way we live is by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; That's where life is. Life is not outside of the word. &gt;&gt; And when you leave the word, you leave God. &gt;&gt; And when you leave God, you step into disorder into chaos and you bring all kinds of sin into your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the separation in Eden didn't start. It did not come from angels or creation or from Adam initially, but from Eve stepping beyond God's word. The Bible said the woman being deceived was in the transgression and the issue was deception and and disobedience. AND SO GOD'S ORDER ALWAYS BEGINS with him first. A covenant comes with God first BEFORE COVENANT WITH OTHERS. &gt;&gt; I want you to get this. Now this is a very important principle. You see God's order always begins with him first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A covenant with God comes before any covenant with others. &gt;&gt; That's why a covenant order is always vertical before it is horizontal. Every true covenant begins with a right relationship with God. &gt;&gt; And only then does it produce right relationships with people. &gt;&gt; So if you want I if you want uh real order in your home, IT STARTS WITH GOD FIRST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT THAT'S WHY LISTEN there should never be divorces in message churches &gt;&gt; is absolutely should never be &gt;&gt; and the reason that it happens is because men seek their own will rather than God's will. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach now. Now you know we we understand this is what this is the root of the problem because at the beginning it wasn't so &gt;&gt; God ordered one man and one one woman. He never ordered marriage and divorce and remarage. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me preach. So the but it always comes because the the order with the heavens was not WAS NOT MADE FIRST. THE COVENANTS GOT TO BE MADE WITH GOD FIRST. THAT'S WHY YOU DO NOT WANT TO TAKE A MATE without the Holy Ghost. A GIRL THAT WOULD TAKE A BOY THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN HIM IS RECEIVING another headship than Christ. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE CHRIST IS THE HEAD OF THE MAN. &gt;&gt; And the same way the woman reflects who the man is. SO THE DESIRE, the real spirituality of a man is shown in who he chooses. SO, A COVENANT BEGINS VERTICALLY first before it does horizontally. &gt;&gt; And and the Bible makes this plain. He says, "Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with thy neighbor as thyself." &gt;&gt; Do you notice God first, not second? &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Love your neighbor first and love God next." &gt;&gt; He said, "Get it right with God first, &gt;&gt; then you'll love your neighbor." Amen. &gt;&gt; And if a love gets right in a person's life with God, it'll it'll bring it'll bring order in a life. IT'LL CAUSE YOU TO CHOOSE THINGS OF GOD'S ORDER THAT WON'T BRING CHAOS, that won't bring sin. AND THAT'S WHY A MARRIAGE COVENANT MUST begin vert vertically WITH BOTH HUSBAND AND WIFE SUBMITTED TO GOD BEFORE IT CAN EVER SUCCEED HORIZONTALLY. BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID, "EXCEPT THE LORD BUILD THE HOUSE, THEY labor in vain that build it." &gt;&gt; That's right. So if you want a house, you want a house God built, &gt;&gt; not one you built &gt;&gt; because it's going to be built on shifting sands. When you get it built on God, the rock, &gt;&gt; then it'll weather the storms that are coming in life because there's plenty of chaos that is coming. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, love between TWO PEOPLE CANNOT STAND LONG WITHOUT THE REVERENCE for God above them. You reverence him first. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the same principle it applies to friendships, to families, TO BUSINESS DEALINGS. &gt;&gt; FOR THE BIBLE SAID, "IN ALL THY WAYS ACKNOWLEDGE HIM." &gt;&gt; So every covenant that endures must begin with God at the center. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God number one. And that's it. Look at our nation. Look at our nation. The nation of America. It wants new order. and bless him. Look at the chaos in our streets. &gt;&gt; Look at the chaos in our news. &gt;&gt; Look at the opposition, the lawlessness, the spirit of lawlessness that is in our world today. &gt;&gt; The It's chaos. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you know that THIS NATION ONCE KNEW ORDER and blessing. It was founded at least in principle with acknowledgments of God. And the Bible said, "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord." &gt;&gt; But as the vertical relationship has been forsaken, order has rapidly given away to chaos. And when a people lose their covenant with God, their agreements with one another lose meaning. And the scripture warns the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that forget God because when the vertical covenant is broken, the horizontal cannot hold. And when EVE DISOBEYED GOD'S WORD, SHE BROKE HER RELATIONSHIP with God. &gt;&gt; AND SHE STEPPED OUTSIDE OF WHAT GOD HAS SPOKEN. AND ONCE THE VERTICAL RELATIONSHIP WAS BROKEN, EVERYTHING CONNECTED TO IT WAS AFFECTED. HER RELATIONSHIP WITH ADAM DIDN'T FALL FIRST. IT FELL APART BECAUSE HER RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD WAS ALREADY BROKEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THE BIBLE SHOWS THIS PRINCIPLE. IT VERY clearly said, you know, he said, God said, "Thou shalt not eat of it." In other words, partake of it. And when that word was violated, fellowship with God was immediately lost. &gt;&gt; And they, what happened then? They hid themselves. And only then and only and then after that brought shame and blame and division and it entered their home and the breakdown with each other from followed the breakdown with with God and the next thing you know there's murder in their home. There's division in their home. There's a a son that is out of the presence of God &gt;&gt; into the land of wandering. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THE CONNECTION WITH GOD WAS LOST. &gt;&gt; So to make this as simple as I know how, WHEN YOU STOP LISTENING TO GOD, YOU CAN'T STAY RIGHT WITH OTHERS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD'S WORD IS BROKEN, THEN HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS SUFFER NEXT. AND THAT'S WHERE MARRIAGES would deteriorate. THAT'S WHERE CHURCHES FALL APART. AND THAT'S WHY GOD ALWAYS DEALS WITH THE HEART UPWARD BEFORE HE DEALS WITH THE LIFE OUTWARD BECAUSE HE SAID, "SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND ITS RIGHTEOUSNESS and then all things else will be added to you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Tim, you don't know how bad I want a wife. Seek God. &gt;&gt; You don't know how bad I want a husband. I need a boyfriend. Brother Tim, I seek God. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he becomes preeminent in your life, only then are you fit for a mate. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you will choose chaos. &gt;&gt; Sin brings chaos. It brings hurt. It brings disease. It brings It brings sorrow. It brings shame. It brings hurt. It brings broken relationships. &gt;&gt; SO ORDER ALWAYS FLOWS FROM THE TOP DOWN. SO THE PROBLEM AT EDEN WAS NOT FIRST a marriage problem. IT WAS A WORD PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; EVERY PROBLEM THAT FOLLOWED CAME FROM THAT ONE PLACE. WHEN THE VERTICAL LINE TO GOD WAS BROKEN, THE HORIZONTAL LINE TO OTHERS COLLAPSED. AND THAT same principle applies today. You break the word, you break fellowship with God. You break fellowship with God, you have disorder in your home, disorder in your church, disorder in your family. Disorder comes everywhere. chaos. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY THAT I SAY MOST marriages can and most marriage problems can be fixed with a good dose of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; What you need is not an intellectual talk. &gt;&gt; OR A PSYCHOLOGIST TO GIVE YOU SOME IDEAS. WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS GET A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD AND THE HOLY GHOST AND THE LOVE OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE AND IT'LL FIX EVERY PROBLEM IN YOUR MARRIAGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And that's the way to avoid marriage problems &gt;&gt; is to be filled with the spirit. &gt;&gt; Because when we're walking in the spirit, man and woman, there's harmony. Yes. &gt;&gt; So you stay aligned with God's word and everything beneath it stays in order. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus referred back to this very moment when he said from the beginning it was not so. He reminded us God's original design was one man one woman united under divine order. &gt;&gt; When that order was violated death entered by one man sinner to the world and death by sin. The continuity was shattered. And that same principle applies today when men gather and decide, "Well, it don't mean that." They're just repeating the same haunting voice, satanic serpent voice that whispered in Eden. &gt;&gt; Paul warned this of this thing. He said, "Let God be true and every man's word be a lie." When God's word is adjusted to fit your human reasoning, &gt;&gt; then your lifeline is broken &gt;&gt; and the result will be confusion. It'll be powerless religion. It'll be ILLEGITIMATE SPIRITUAL OFFSPRING, CHURCH MEMBERS BORN OF A SYSTEM RATHER THAN THE WORD. ONCE THE CONTINUITY IS BROKEN, EVERYTHING FRA FRACTURES. YOU KNOW, THE LIFELINE, THE TIMELINE, the covenant, the flow of life. AND WHAT CAUSED IT? STEPPING OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARY OF THE GOD'S WORD. And that was the original breach in Eden. And it remains THE ROOT OF EVERY BREAKDOWN SENSE that God's order has never failed. Man's relationship to the word has. &gt;&gt; So you stay in continuity with the word and then life flows. &gt;&gt; So what happened when they didn't follow it? Chaos. Order turned to chaos. Cain rose up and killed his brother Abel. Murder was not just a crime. It was a evidence that God's order had been abandoned. &gt;&gt; Cain was of that wicked one. &gt;&gt; Chaos always reproduces after its kind. &gt;&gt; I don't know how you can expect anything else. &gt;&gt; Sin produces sin. &gt;&gt; Sin in the home produces sin in the children. &gt;&gt; That's right. And it con IT CONTINUES FALLING RIGHT DOWN, YOU KNOW, THROUGH generations because what YOU DO TODAY DON'T JUST AFFECT YOU. It's going to affect YOUR CHILDREN. IT'S GOING TO AFFECT YOUR GRANDCHILDREN. IT'LL AFFECT YOUR great grandchildren. &gt;&gt; IT'LL SET PATTERNS IN THE HOME, IN THE FAMILY. THAT'S WHY YOU WANT YOUR FOCUS ON GOD NUMBER ONE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Because again CHAOS ALWAYS red reproduces after its kind. CHAOS NEVER PRODUCES SONS. IT PRODUCES SEED OF THE serpent offspring of Satan. Once God's order is rejected, violence, corruption, wickedness would multiply rapidly. Soon the world became so corrupted from that one sin. &gt;&gt; The whole world became so corrupted until God himself testified the earth also was corrupt before God and the earth was filled with violence. &gt;&gt; That's Genesis 6:11. And the thoughts of men were on evil continually. Genesis 6:5. This order had reached such a depth that in order to preserve his purpose to get it the world back on track, God had to act decisively &gt;&gt; and he washed the earth with water. And he says, "I even I DO BRING A FLOOD OF WATERS ON THE EARTH TO DESTROY ALL FLESH." And the and THE FLOOD WAS MORE THAN PUNISHMENT. IT WAS CORRECTION. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS CORRECTING THE DISORDER. &gt;&gt; IT WAS JUDGMENT YET BUT IT WAS JUDGMENT WITH REDEMPTION IN MIND. I want you to get this. A lot OF TIMES WHEN JUDGMENT COMES, IT IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REDEMPTION. &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME? &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD PRESERVED NOAH IN THAT TIME. GOD HAD SOMEBODY IN THE MIDST of chaos. &gt;&gt; Amen. A MAN WHO FOUND GRACE IN THE EYES OF THE LORD. OH, I want to be that PERSON TODAY. &gt;&gt; IN ALL THE CHAOS IN THE WORLD THAT IT CAN BE SAID OF ME, Noah found grace &gt;&gt; in the sight of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And through him, God reset the earth and chaos was restrained. So God's plan could continue. So here the pattern continues and it never changes. God creates order. Satan introduces deception. Chaos follows the rebellion. God intervenes to restore order. And this is what's always happened. From the flood, from Eden to the flood, even to today God's word will be rejected. Chaos follows. But whenever God speaks again and the spirit of God moves and life begins to spring again, order is restored because he's a God who brings harmony out of disorder &gt;&gt; and light out of darkness. Now, it wasn't long after the flood that God after God had washed the earth to restore order that rebellion rose again. &gt;&gt; I want you to see something. There is a cycle that comes on with generations. &gt;&gt; The first order, THE FIRST GENERATION WILL WALK WITH GOD. THE NEXT generation will not have the same desire, the same vision, the same purpose. And so he was not long after Noah that the Bible said and Kush begat Nimrod and he began to be a mighty one in the earth and he was a mighty one before the Lord and he wasn't just merely hunting animals. It is it speaks of conquest, domination, self-exaltation. Nimrod, he rose as a RULER WHO EXALTED HIMSELF ABOVE OTHERS. HE GATHERED MEN UNDER his authority. HE STARTED BUILDING A KINGDOM centered on human power rather than divine submission. AND HE ESTABLISHED A KINGDOM THERE in Babel. And there men conceived a plan that revealed the true condition of their hearts. They say in Genesis 11:4, "And they said, go to let us build a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name. Now &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO WATCH THE SAME ambition that Satan had. &gt;&gt; GOD HAD WASHED THE EARTH. HE HAD HE BECAUSE OF THE CHAOS, HE HAD NOW BROUGHT IT BACK TO COMPLETE pristine condition. But it isn't long until man began to work with deception. And man begins to build a tower. And this tower of Babel is a representation of every denomination today. It is a tower that men made &gt;&gt; because the word of God is the name of God and the name of the Lord is a mighty tower that the righteous run into and are saved. &gt;&gt; But the towers that men build, here's the deal. They built a tower THAT WOULD BE HIGHER THAN the judgment waters of the flood. SO THAT WHEN SO THAT WHEN JUDGMENT COME AGAIN, they can live any way they wanted to and run up in their tower &gt;&gt; and be safe. &gt;&gt; This is the goal of every denominational system. Yeah. &gt;&gt; They built a tower of religion &gt;&gt; that you that will be there and out of reach of God's judgment where you can live any way you want to and when judgment comes run up into the tower. But it won't work &gt;&gt; because this tower was not just architecture. It just wasn't just a an Eiffel Tower and piece of architect. It was defiance. &gt;&gt; It was in your face, God. It was man saying, "We will live how we choose. And if God chooses to judge it, we will rise above it." And the tower represent confidence in human systems and human unity and human security apart from God. AND THE BIBLE SAID THEY ALL SPOKE ONE LANGUAGE, but that didn't mean they were in divine order. &gt;&gt; Without submission to God, that's not unity. That's not order. Is organized rebellion. &gt;&gt; And this exaltation of sin again produced chaos upon the earth that had already been redeemed by water. And God looked down and said, "This they begin to do, and nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do." And when man is united against God, destruction is inevitable. So God intervened, not to destroy, but to restrain chaos. And he said, "Go down. Let us confound our language that they not understand one another's speech." Now, I want you to listen. What looked like disorder, confusion of tongues was actually God restoring order &gt;&gt; by dividing their language. He stopped the spread of rebellion. &gt;&gt; He preserved his redemptive plan. The Bible said, "Therefore is the name of it called Babel because the Lord did dare confound the language of all the earth." So out of that confusion, God did something remarkable yet something he always seems to do. I want you TO UNDERSTAND, HE DID NOT TRY TO FIX BABEL. &gt;&gt; HE CALLED A MAN OUT OF IT. &gt;&gt; AND THE LORD SAID TO ABRAM, "GET THEE OUT OF THAT COUNTRY UNTO A LAND WHICH I WILL SHOW YOU." &gt;&gt; AND GOD SEPARATED ABRAHAM FROM THE CHAOS SO A DIVINE ORDER COULD BE ESTABLISHED. &gt;&gt; You see, Abraham wasn't chosen because he WAS GREAT, BUT BECAUSE HE WAS WILLING TO BELIEVE and to obey. AND THE BIBLE SAID HE BELIEVED in the Lord and it was counted to him for righteousness. &gt;&gt; And through Abraham, God called a righteous seed, a people through whom he would reveal his word. And later that word would come in the form of law. And that was not to enslave them. It was it was to order a nation for he said he showeth his word unto Jacob, his statutes, and his judgment unto Israel. So this is what God does. So when he calls, he calls to separate you from disorder, &gt;&gt; from chaos. &gt;&gt; And I want you to see the message that we have today. It is not A MESSAGE TO UNITE WITH THE WORLD TO BE LIKE THEM. &gt;&gt; It is A MESSAGE TO COME OUT OF HER MY people &gt;&gt; to COME OUT OF THE BABYLON, COME OUT OF BABEL &gt;&gt; and come to come unto me, sayeth the Lord. I want to put order in your life. AND WHEN I WHEN YOU COME TO ME, I PUT ORDER. I BRING order &gt;&gt; because when his word is received, his people come out and that's when order is restored and his purpose is clarified. Now, brother Brandham warned us. He warned us like that. He said, "We took dress and try to fulfill what the modders tried to bring to bring them in. you'll never win them like that. In other words, we try to dress like them to bring them in. That was my my cousins ideas, you know, the Pentecostal girls. That was my first cousins. They wore their miniskirts, you know, because how can we witness to people about Christ if we if we look like old foggies? Nobody will talk to us. So, we dress like them and our miniskirts so we can win them to Christ. And brother Brandon said, "We took dress and try to fulfill what the moderators try to do to bring them in. You'll never win them by that. They got more of that than you have. You have got no business on their ground. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let them come over to yours where the real baptism is shining, where the real power of THE RESURRECTION. DON'T TRY TO BUILD A CHURCH LIKE THEIRS. DON'T TRY to have a pastor like theirs. AMEN. DON'T TRY TO DO THIS OR other corporate with THE WORLD. THEY SHINE WITH HOLLYWOOD. The real gospel glows with power. Eagles hear that. They don't look for a shine. They look for a glow. Glowing with humility. Glowing with love. Glowing with power. And that's where real eagles hunt. You can't scratch in a barnyard and please him. You'll never be able to do it. You can never tell it to him because he don't believe it. But let that voice SCREAM FROM HEAVEN. I AM HE THAT WAS dead and I'm alive for again. Something takes place. I'M THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, and forever. And it shall come to pass in THE LAST DAYS. I'LL POUR OUT MYSELF UPON ALL FLESH. Glory to God. I'll quicken your mortal language. I'll quicken your mortal tongues. I'll give YOU THE EVIDENCE THAT I'M GOING TO BRING YOU IN THE resurrection with me. And hungry hearted eagles reach for that as hard as they can. It's the pearl of great price. And they sell everything to go buy. &gt;&gt; BUT GUESS WHAT? CHICKENS RUN FROM THAT VOICE. And one day we'll cry for the rocks and the mountain to hide them from the wrath of the lamb and the tribulation to come. But hungryarted eagles reach for that that says I'm the same yesterday, today, and forever. And I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'll quicken your mortal language, h your mortal tongues. I'll give you the evidence. I'm going to bring you in the rapture. And the chickens will cluck and say that the SCRIPTURE IN JOEL IS NOT OUR MANIFESTATION. And let me TELL YOU, FOR THEM IT ISN'T &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S NOT FOR CHICKENS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY WILL NEVER FLY THAT HIGH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT THOSE WHO LIVES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN ORDER BY THE WORD WILL FLY THAT HIGH BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES. &gt;&gt; And when he moves, light dawn. And when LIGHT COMES, IT BRINGS SEPARATION. and sin and unbelief separates. &gt;&gt; Now, let me bring this down to close cuz we have to find the place as we look at this for a moment. I want you to think about a woman You know, sometimes you look at all the Old Testament as types, but did you know there's types in the New Testament? Because they were prophesying of an end time people. There was a woman by the name of Mary Magdalene out of whom he cast seven devils. She types the woman the bride in the last day. &gt;&gt; Because she WAS A WOMAN WALKING IN CHAOS. &gt;&gt; I mean, somebody's got seven devils. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of chaos in their lives. You know, you know, brother Brandham, Brother Brandham defined one of them as a high school spirit, &gt;&gt; hardy, rebellious. I don't know what all they were, but as I said about Legion last week, you invite one devil to live with you and he invites another &gt;&gt; until finally your identity is no longer your own. It's with the devil who has you control legion. My name is Legion. This woman had seven devils. This woman, this bride in this end time is a people of whom all of the unbelief of seven ages was heaped upon. And it took a word of God to take and cast it out. But I want you to know PERHAPS SHE WAS THAT Mary that was in Simon's house. Now there's two occasions of that of a Mary, BUT PERHAPS SHE WAS THAT woman at Simon the Pharisees house and her life was in chaos. Her life was a disaster. SHE had lived in EVERY KIND OF SIN UNTIL she had become a prostitute. BUT PASSING BY, passing by, she saw Jesus, that prophet, that one who had delivered others, &gt;&gt; THAT ONE WHO COULD BRING ORDER INTO CHAOS. THE ONE WHO WOULD TAKE A BLIND BARNAMEUS WHOSE LIFE WAS IN DARKNESS, WHOSE LIFE WAS IN CHAOS, AND WOULD TAKE AND TURN THAT around and BRING HIM FROM DARKNESS INTO LIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And bring order into his life. &gt;&gt; And she looked at him and she said, "There's that prophet of Galilee &gt;&gt; who brings order." &gt;&gt; And passing by that way, she saw he had a need. &gt;&gt; She saw he was unwelcomed in Leodysa. that he HIS FEET WAS NOT WASHED, that he his hair was was not oiled and and and the bomb put on him from the travel AND THE OINTMENT WAS NOT PUT ON HIM AND HE SAW HIM IN A CORNER NEGLECTED. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES WE SEE OUR OWN problems and WE SEE OUR OWN SITUATIONS. But I wonder sometimes if we could just look away and see right now that there IS A CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN REJECTED BY LEODYSIA WHO IS OUTSIDE OF THE DOOR AND HE IS KNOCKING. And yet this woman looks upon him AND SHE REALIZES HE IS THE ONE WHO TURNS CHAOS INTO ORDER. AND I TELL YOU WHAT, I'M WILLING TO GIVE EVERYTHING I GOT. YES. &gt;&gt; ALL THE MONEY I HAVE SAVED, ALL THE PROVISIONS I HAVE, AND GO AND GET THE BEST ALABASTER BOX. TO GO AND GET THE ointment to crown him king of my life &gt;&gt; AND TO LAY MYSELF DOWN AT HIS FEET AND WASH HIS FEET WITH MY tears &gt;&gt; so he can turn my life that is in chaos into order. I'll tell you what, when the self-styled religious saw that altar with that woman a mess with that woman crying out with that woman kissing his feet with that woman there, you know, asking forgiveness, asking for mercy, with that woman PUTTING THE THE BEST OINTMENT UPON HIM TO TAKE THE STAKE OFF OF him that man had put upon him BECAUSE GOD HAD COME AND WALKED THE PATH OF MAN. And there as he HAD WALKED THE PATH OF MAN, THE STINK OF THE PATH HAD GOT HIS FEET DIRTY. BUT THIS WOMAN SAW he needed service and she was not willing to allow him to sit there. But the unwelcome Christ neglected, forgotten, &gt;&gt; and abandoned. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he was the only hope she had. &gt;&gt; No man that she had ever got anything from had ever brought order to her life. Every man had always added more disorder and chaos, more hurt, more confusion. But let me tell you this one when he came, he came to restore divine order. He healed the sick. He forgave sins. He cast out devils. He spoke with authority not derived from tradition but from heaven himself. And where religion had confused, he came and HE CLARIFIED WHERE SYSTEMS HAD BOUND MEN DOWN. CHRIST SET THEM FREE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, he came TO BRING ORDER. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW HERE, THIS WOMAN COMES TO GIVE him worship. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN HE DOES, IT'S OUT OF order &gt;&gt; to the human thinking. &gt;&gt; AND THE HUMAN THINKING thinks he has turned my feast into chaos. This woman has kissing, crying, washing, but it wasn't chaos. &gt;&gt; IT WAS DIVINE ORDER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAD MOVED. THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAD BROUGHT HER. THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAUSED HER TO KNEEL. THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAUSED HER TO WEEP. I KNOW WE DON'T WANT EMOTION IN THE CHURCHES ANYMORE, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVES, IT BRINGS NOT MAN'S ORDER ANYMORE. IT DON'T BRING STINESS AND IT brings hallelujah. It brings a true worship. &gt;&gt; IT BREAKS OUT OF MAN'S ORDER INTO GOD'S ORDER. And this WOMAN BEGAN TO CRY and she began to weep and she be to repent of her sin. AND AND THE PHARISEE, THE RELIGIOUS ORDER CALLED IT CHAOS. AND JESUS saw order. &gt;&gt; This is orderly worship. This is whom the father seeks &gt;&gt; to worship me in spirit and in truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And she began to scream and to cry. And Pharisees said, "If he only knew, you see, he's no prophet. If he only knew what sort of woman it was washing his feet." You know what I think? We sometimes sing the song, when he was on the cross, I was on his mind. But when he watched that woman, he was watching you. &gt;&gt; Amen. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE WAS LOOKING past through time &gt;&gt; and HE WAS SEEING A PEOPLE WHO WOULD LEAVE THE ORDER OF PHARISEIC RELIGION OF DENOMINATIONALISM AND THE ORDER OF MAN AND WOULD GET IN THE ORDER OF THE SPIRIT LONG ENOUGH TO GET SAVED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID WHEN I GOT SAVED HE SAID I GOT OUT OF ORDER. I GOT IN THE SPIRIT. I THIS OLD HEART BEGIN TO CRY AND WEEP OUT BEFORE GOD. You see, because what man calls disorder and chaos, God calls order. &gt;&gt; And as he watched her, he says, I think of it when he laid his hands on that woman, Mary Magdalene. He says, "I'm laying hands on my bride who one day will be so possessed with all the isms of man. But one word from me &gt;&gt; will heal her." &gt;&gt; Because when a message released, light dawn. And when light dawn, disorder leaves &gt;&gt; and chaos goes &gt;&gt; and order begins. And he said, "You Pharisees, you religious system, you wouldn't wash my feet. You was You would not anoint me. You wouldn't give me what was due. But this woman, but this woman, I don't know about you, but I want to be this woman. &gt;&gt; But this woman, your sins, which are many, &gt;&gt; are all forgiven you. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHAT WAS HE DOING? HE WAS BRINGING ORDER &gt;&gt; INTO A LIFE OF CONFUSION, INTO A LIFE OF CHAOS. AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S TO DO FOR YOU IN YOUR LIFE TODAY. IS TO BRING YOU OUT OF CHAOS &gt;&gt; INTO order around himself. &gt;&gt; Where your life is peaceful, &gt;&gt; where sorrow ends, where joy begins, where love is expressed, where perfect harmony remains forever. Let's bow our heads together as musicians come now. What men called order, God called chaos. And where chaos ruled, the word stepped in to restore life. And when he does, life is divine order. And I'll tell you what, if the spirit of God is not the life of a movement, then it's chaos. We're moving into a cycle where phariseic religion is moving. Where rabbis, teachers of synagogues have raised up, every man with his own idea trying to bring their own order. But that always brings chaos. The order of the Holy Ghost is to worship him in spirit and truth. And God wants to bring you out of the chaos of your mind, out of the chaos of your heart into divine order. I want to ask you. Lord, let this be a time where the spirit of God moves. I have something in my heart. I have something in my life. Come breathe on me. Bring me Lord into that highest order where I'm not just in an image by your word and and I reached a certain form of religion that's still a lifeless corpse. Breathe on me, Lord. Breathe on me. Let the spirit of the Lord breathe. Just takes one moment in his presence. Just one moment in his presence. But it takes a humble heart. It takes somebody willing to wash his feet. It takes somebody who's willing to give their all to get the best alabaster box, who make that full surrender, who yield themselves completely. I want you to look at your own life today and I want you to see, is there chaos? For some of you, sin has taken you further than you ever imagined you'd go. But are you willing to move out of your comfort zone to give your all to surrender everything to come under divine headship? Are you willing to let the spirit of God move upon your life? Will you invite him that you as you make a move toward God, he can turn to you and say, "Your sins are all forgiven." There's no greater words than that. There's no greater words than that. Ever trespass under the blood. You're free. The demons that held you bound and tormented you day and night gone. And you're free to serve the living God. You don't have to live in that condition. There's a God calling you to separate from the chaos, to separate from sin, from unbelief. Allow him to do it today. How many would say today, God bring some order in my life? How many would say today, Lord, oh God, breathe on me. Let me be the highest order of your creation. where Lord, you just form me in your image, but more than that, you breathe your own life into me to where I'm alive with the spirit, where I move with him, that out of chaos, he brings order. I want to be yielded to you, Lord. If you'll wash his feet this morning, he'll say to you, too, your sins are all forgiven. I say to this woman, I say to this man, I say to this person, your sins are forgiven. Oh, let it breathe on me. Let it breathe on me. Let the Holy Ghost now breathe on me. Let him breathe on me. Let him breathe on me. Let the Holy Ghost now breathe. Oh, and let him feel me now. Let him feel me now. Let the Holy Ghost just breathe. Oh, let him feel me now. Let him feel me now. Let go. Oh, feel me now. Let him feel me now. Let him feel me now. Let the Holy Ghost just be. What do I do, brother Tim? Go washing his feet. Amen. That's exactly right. Come on. Give him that worship that he deserves. Go to washing his feet right now. Go to give him the praise, the honor in your life. Amen. Let the joy bells ring because you can do him a service this morning that you can move in his life your life. Let him move in your life and move darkness and set from you. &gt;&gt; Let him feel you now. &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; just feel me now. Make it your prayer. Let him breathe on me. Let it brea. Let the ghost on me. Let it breathe on me. Let it breathe on me. and the Holy Ghost now breathe on me. Let him feel me now. Let him feel me now. Let the Holy Ghost feel me now. Let him feel me now. Let him feel. Holy Ghost. Now feel one more time. Let him breathe. Let him breathe on me. Let him breathe on me. Let the Holy Ghost brea. Brea on me. That's a dear path for the water. Amen. &gt;&gt; The water soul my soul is after me. You alone all of my hearts. desire and I long to worship. &gt;&gt; You alone. You alone are my strength, my shield. To you alone and my strength. You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship you. &gt;&gt; You're my friend and you are my brother and you are the king. I want you more than any other so much more than anything. You alone are my strength, my shield. You alone make my spirit real. You alone are my heart desire and I long to worship you.
