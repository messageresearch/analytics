to pay the price of redemption and to bring healing and deliverance for your people lord we thank you that you're that kind of a god that even as the psalmist would say what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man the prophets that you would visit them but oh god you have been mindful of man though we don't understand how the great god of heaven who created this son the moon the stars of the universe who is so great and we're just a tiny [Music] little bitty speck out in the universe just as big as a piece of dust compared to many of the planets and places around in the universe but you cared so much that god became a part of this dust took on humanity to pay the price of redemption what a mighty god we serve lord we have we've been here in this time and you have trained us to believe lord you've given us message on message of message to increase our faith and then we have seen your signs and your wonders we say in your miraculous power as it brought deliverance to your children and oh god we don't want to be rebuked tonight because we have no faith but we want to be a people that you find faith in and i pray oh god as we put aside all our unbelief and doubt and fear and everything else and look to you the almighty i said oh god that you would just encourage our faith to believe the word of promise and that you bring healing for your children there are those that have suffered with the covenant or covet related or maybe after covet and now it's attacked in other kinds of parts of the body lord i pray in the name of jesus that you bring healing lord to those that recovered like sister ruth and brother daryl and lord brother tim winters oh god who's recovering and getting stronger every day and he being healed but lord tonight made faith's rise in his heart our brother kenny our sister genie lord they suffered day upon day and i remember lord the song the psalmist got so real to brother brown though i have suffered in many a way and i cried for healing both night and day but faith wasn't forgotten by the father above for he sent down a sign on the wings of a dove made the holy spirit just fluttered down into the rooms and the places where these are lord and these needs are uncle jim in the hospital or wherever he's at lord and turned over to hospice now and god our brother ron that has a need in his body you're still the healer you're still the deliverer and we're asking for deliverance for him may the dove come to him tonight i pray lord for the other needs brother james who suffered many many hours with

you don't have enough second corinthians 10 and also philippians 2. um just like to speak to you again on casting down imaginations amen i believe it's the battle we're in right now and uh preached on it here right this last service before we had to shut down for a few weeks and and i'll tell you i lived it i lived it and so we're here to uh minister on it again second corinthians 10 and verse 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ amen every thought philippians 2 and verse 1 it says if there be any therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercy fulfill ye my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one accord and of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem the other better than themselves look not every man to his own things but every man also to the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god let this mind be in you but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion of man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee shall bow on things in heaven things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord the glory of god the father amen we let you be seated this evening casting down imaginations you know our mind constantly bombards us with thoughts and think you know i thought sometimes you can go very deep into things even before you even realize it and sometimes your thoughts don't take you down very good paths many times you can you know feel something in your body and your thoughts begin to work and and you begin to think of what what i might have and next thing you know you self-diagnosed yourself and you put yourself in the grave and that's where your thoughts will take you if you allow them to go that keep going on down that way and i i don't know how many times a day or during the day you have to take and realize here where your thoughts are taking you and grab a hold of them and bring them back to the word of god because you know our thoughts you know they're they're they're human they're we're human and so there's only one place in this time that we're in and it seems like all hell is against us and it is and it seems like it's getting worse and it is it seems like you know it's getting darker and it is there's things that are going on in this atmospheres and and i mean it's not nothing that we're going through or have went through in this last few weeks or this year has surprised god god knows all about it he's already he pre-planned this he allowed it to come to the place that it is and whether it be the political climate or or the spiritual climate it's all been orchestrated by god we must never forget god has never lost control he's always in control of every situation whether it be our own personal struggle or your own personal battle or or or the world and the whole world in general god has never lost control god is in control of every situation amen he know he has put a and the scripture even talks about you know the devil and how he's put a bit in his mouth and he's even in control of the devil the devil is only doing things orchestrating things according to the plan of almighty god and therefore we cannot get our minds on the political things and things in this world and dwell on that because that's not our home and that's not our goal amen amen our goal is leaving here you know what brother branham would talk about this in many places about faults and and bringing the thoughts under subjection to the word of god he said if we could throw ourself completely to god and completely to his will and be lost to our own thoughts be lost let our own thoughts go and let the mind of christ be in us them same operations of the spirit would work through us just as natural things do my amen just as natural you know and he's speaking of you know you think you know you think hand move you know it's moving before even sometimes you know things happen before you even think i'm almost seems like but amen if you think you know i want to walk over here you're beginning to put things in motion and it's just natural it's a natural man human abilities he said but if we can lose ourselves to our own thoughts and let the mind of christ be in you amen in us the operations of the spirit will work through us just as natural things do amen the same things because we were first created for that world we were first created for that purpose to be under the complete control of god the complete rule of god and to the praise of god to live for god that's what our duty is that's who we are that's why we're here upon this earth amen it's not for what we see around us it is for the operation for the purpose the rule and the praise of almighty god amen he says we he said we cannot alter god's word we have to alter our thinking to his thinking amen it's not about altering the word to our thinking we see where that takes man and it gets uh it gets them off in some creed or some dogma why because they altered the word of god instead of altering their thinking to the word of god you know i've used this as actually one one of my first sermons i ever preached was at a goat show and yeah i know that's shocking i understand it was a little devotional on a sunday morning and and they wanted dad to actually speak at it and he he was wanted to be back home for that and so he asked me to do it and i i just kind of looked at him like i'm looking at you now a little bit dumbfounded and i'm like what do you mean speak to him what do you he said you can do it well thanks and so i got to thinking about what to speak to him you know i i was like well i mean i don't even know where to start and so i got to look thinking about something though in the goat world and and there's a something called a score card and when you when you go to uh to be judged by a judge they have to put something that's an ultimate or a absolute so they they print out what would be the perfect goat and so you get so many points for this and so many points for that i won't go into all the details but you get and and it gets up to 100 points so theoretically the judge is he's watching you walk through the ring with your goat he's saying this goat adds up to 94 points that was 92 points that went and he places them in lines according to what they are placed according to the scorecard because there has to be an ultimatum or an absolute somewhere amen and so i was talking to them about that and i said you know many times many breeders try to change the scorecard to match their goat instead of breeding the goat to match the scorecard and i said it's the same thing with the bible amen people have taken the word of god and they try to change the word of god to match them instead of changing this to match the word of god and the devil is always wanting to do that he's always wanting to make you think well that's your thoughts or you know maybe that's what god thinks about you but that it ain't what you think about yourself or what comes through this brain it's what god thought about you it's what the word of god says and you have to stand upon that word no matter what happens amen so we have to alter our thinking to his thinking amen if our thoughts over depression we have to think what he thinks the joy of the lord is our strength if our thoughts are of sickness we have to think what he thinks by his stripes i'm healed this is his thoughts it's the word written these are the eternal thoughts of almighty god written down on paper they cannot change they cannot fail they are there they are the absolute to stand upon in uncertain times amen that when all hell is against you you have something firm to stand upon that's the only thing there is this church is not firm enough this uh this world is not firm enough there's nothing in government's helps it's firm enough there's only one thing that can hold a believer in this tower that is the word of god hallelujah so when you when you when you do that you let the mind of christ come into you then you'll think like he thinks hallelujah he said when you come to total obedience is another place he said then you can have possession when you obey he said you've got to fully surrender your own thoughts your own will your own mind and let the mind of christ operate in you he said now do you think the mind of christ and you would say the days of miracles are passed no way do you think the mind of christ and you would say the bible's right in some places and not in others no way the mind of christ will sanction every word that christ ever said so if you don't use your own mind just use his mind hallelujah you know what we've got these five senses and this cta smell fill in here and i know with the coronavirus you only had about three of them for a while but you know they come back sooner or later but you know we got five senses and these five senses are not they're not given to you to access this the five senses are only given to you to access the world or the natural world around you amen you see taste feel smell or hear they're okay but don't trust them unless they agree with the word hallelujah if they agree with the word then fine they're all right but if they disagree with the word don't listen to them hallelujah amen imaginations conscience memories reasons affection they're all right as long as they agree with the word but if they don't agree with the word don't trust them hallelujah amen if you're affection don't agree with the word get rid of it if you reason and disagrees with the word get rid of it if your thoughts disagree with your imagination disagree if your conscience disagree get rid of it amen there's only one thing to lean upon and stand upon and that's the word of god i'm going to drive this point home tonight there's only one thing in this time that we're living in you can stand upon is the word of god just this past week you know it does something to a man when you get three three nights during the week you're woken up with emergency situations your wife's calling you and telling you she can't breathe and your oxygen is falling and falling and the devil's putting all kinds of thoughts in your mind trying to tell you all kinds of things take you way down the road somewhere constantly having to bring those thoughts back and say no by his stripes she's healed no by his stripes she's healed no by his stripes she's healed amen it was constant night after night after night by his stripes she's healed it's the only thing you can do in this hour listen amen if you go by what you think and then it'll take you down a long dark road somewhere and drop you off somewhere but if you'll bring it back to the word of god and say no devil not tonight satan not today satan by his stripes she's healed amen when god can get a man in his hands well who wants to be in his hands to where he can get the senses and the conscience and the affections and the reasons and everything cleaned out until it stands with god in the spirit there's not a devil in the world that can poke a doubt in right there he'll come around saying you don't feel no better has nothing to do with how i feel devil it only has to do with the word of god your conscience will be gone and that flu that channel between you and god be clear and all of a sudden a shout come out hallelujah don't god save me yet i'll trust him this is exactly could you imagine the mind battles and and the reasonings and the imaginations that job had i mean there's a children gone everything he had gone in just a few moments it's all gone and he's now broke out and boiled sitting on the ash sheep and his wife saying why don't you just curse god and die you need to say it and i no doubt yeah listen it wasn't like he didn't have a mind battle he was human he had mind battles he had all kinds of things going through his mind as he scraped off them bowls and he went through it night after night and day after day and time after time and he's going through his mind what did i do wrong i must have did something wrong i must have said no i have a sacrifice oh hallelujah i've been down that road the devil tried to take me there when my little boy andrew was born and he couldn't breathe he immediately brought to my mind you must have sinned he must have done something wrong but god reminded me no you've got a sacrifice hallelujah and the blood has been paid for that little boy's healing this will be nothing but a testimony and it's a testimony today of god's healing grace hallelujah he said all of a sudden when all those things begin to clear out a hallelujah break forth i'm ready to hear some hallelujahs and some glory to gods and it'll shine out why the word of god is working through there in the power of god to back it up but it's a battleground it's a place the devil's got to come in the mind the mind is the gate to the spirit and he attacks the mind to get to the spirit and the next thing you know the spirit that once was elevated is now cast down and turned to inward thoughts and and thoughts of suicide and thoughts of unbelief and thought and right that doesn't mean the soul is not still saved it's the devil's thoughts let's just put it back where it belongs the thoughts you had this week that you ain't gonna make it that ain't your thoughts that's the devil's thoughts the thoughts of of saying you ain't born again that ain't your thoughts that's the devil's thoughts the thoughts of saying you can't be saved that's not your thoughts or you can't be healed that's not your thoughts that's the devil's thoughts but tonight we're turning away from all those things and we're looking to the word of god what does he think about the situation brother aaron god thinks you're healing his thinking says you're healed amen his thoughts says you're delivered his thought says you're free his thought says there's no more change there's no more bondage there's no more devil this is his thoughts it's your battleground though it's a war the greatest battle ever fought be a good one to go listen to about right now your mind opens up it accepts the spirit or it rejects the spirit right here you can have little consciences and little feelings and little sensations all those things nothing to do with it just a little sensation but when it comes to reality your mind opens up and your mind will either accept it or reject it and he makes a statement god let none of them miss this it's right here if he can turn your thoughts to dying and depression you'll go down down down down you can go from a healthy person right down into the grave it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and it and listens to your conscience listens to your memories listen to your affection but when your mind closes itself off to those things and let god the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of god and satan cannot battle against that hallelujah that's what jesus showed us there when he came against him he said it is written it is written it is written it wasn't what he thought it was what was he wrote him back to the word of god you know we know that battle has raged since eden it's where it started in the battle of the human mind satan started it when he did what he did to him to eve and he put a thought there the brandon would call it he said he would stop with the channel by just whitewashing it a little bit what he will do with your thoughts is maybe not tell you you're not going to be saved or not going to be healed you're just not going to be saved or healed tonight whitewash it a little bit amen surely you know god you made those words he spoke that but surely that ain't what he means yeah he knew the word was right he knew what he knew god i mean he wasn't stupid even though i called him stupid a lot he pretty smart fella cunning to be honest with you he brought up a good one with this coronavirus just to be honest i mean he's made it to where pastor can't win i know i told we took a left turn but that's exactly right you know it's my ask or no mask is this or that what do we do here and no matter what the pastor decides he can't win amen so what is he doing he's trying to bring this he said it's just like he talks about it you know in this he talks about his mama how she would give her castor oil he'd give her she would give him castor oil i i'm thankful science has advanced past this we talked about that the other day could you imagine having to get bled out they bleed them out can they get a mercy i'm thankful science has progressed even the last six months leave that right there but anyway you see he said they should put a little orange juice in it try to make it go down better he said that was just hypocritical get up in the nighttime she'd give us that stuff for croup and put a little cold oil castor oil put sugar on her something hypocritical he said it just about burned your tonsils out after the sugar was left i ain't never tried it so i don't know and i don't ever plan on tearing but since satan tries to be hypocritical about things he'll give you a little something but he'll sugarcoat it he'll try to make it you know just a little easier more simpler plan more sensible he said there but there's no more sensible plan than what god laid down at the beginning listen i'm not here to give you the mind of man or or the mind of the government or a mind of some the most smartest greatest intelligent man on the earth listen we're talking about the mind of christ the mind of christ who brought this whole thing into existence to the earth hangs in this place the sun and the moon and the stars amen was looking at them last night beautiful incredible landscape of stars and god blew them off that's the mind i'm talking about i'm not even talking about a mind that can invent an automobile that you come to church tonight or build this building that's not the mind we want we're talking about the mind the greatest mind hallelujah the mind of christ working in a people the battle rage when eve opened her mind and she listened to his reasoning casting down imagination's reasonings she caught it she caught that thought the devil care and she started reasoning on it you know the devil sent a thought and said you know you're losing your mind maybe since that's somebody here tonight you you're losing your mind there's nothing no hope for you you're you're just out there and there's no way back and you stay on that trail you'll go a long ways but if you can ever just somehow come back and bring it back to this right here you know we was in poland one time and there was this lady that was sister that was out we didn't know what i was speaking and she was in menopause she totally lost her mind sitting out there in the audience and she's sitting there and and she's had three i don't remember how many children three or four children husband totally lost it just almost like a daze over her face i didn't realize i did i didn't catch it sitting there and heard about it later now as i was preaching i said the devil comes and brings thoughts you've crossed the line you went too far there's no hope for you i said but that devil is a liar and when i spoke that it was the exact thing that was the devil had put on her that she had crossed the line and there was no hope for her and it broke it off of her she went home and she became amen back to being a regular mama again and a a wife again to her husband making him his favorite pie he said i went home and i had my wife again brother timothy hallelujah he's the same god tonight [Music] may there be a word spoke that'll break something off of somebody's life that they can go home and be a wife again they can go home and be a husband again they can be home and be a real daughter and son and god of god amen i believe that's the power in the word of god all it takes is just a word and it's the same power that said let there be hallelujah he said one little iota one little bit of moving away from god's word was disbelief caused all the trouble how we got how are we going to get back by still disbelieving the word you can't do it you got to shut off your conscience shut off your memories shut hello somebody i know satan's come after attack after attack shut off those memories shut off the memories and say and the reasons and say just cast them down so we don't reason about it nothing at all we're going to accept the word of god upon the bases god said so god said so and he said when you accept it like that it makes a stream between you and god and the channels become open and therefore god can do something for you oh hallelujah he said there's the battle he said that's the front line oh hallelujah he said now let's not use a 22 rifle let's go get an atomic bomb glory to god i don't know about you but if our big old giant bear was coming in my home i wouldn't try to hit it with a slingshot i wouldn't try to hit it with a baseball bat i'd go get the biggest gun i got amen this is what he said listen that devil is coming against the people of god he said let's not use just a 22 rifle let's get the atomic bomb let's do the job right oh hallelujah let's get god's
