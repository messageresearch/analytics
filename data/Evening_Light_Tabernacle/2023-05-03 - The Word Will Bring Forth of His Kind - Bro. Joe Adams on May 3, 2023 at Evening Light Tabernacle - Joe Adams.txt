won't pull down father no strongholds that you won't tear down tonight God your word will bring forth as it is Promised in your word father we're so thankful tonight that we serve a God that's willing to do anything and everything to ensure that his word will be made manifest and we just invite you tonight Lord you give us words to speak [Music] or there not be the words of a man but father you would come and you'd anoint my lips my spirit to get out of the way and allow you to move and orchestrate as you will tonight Lord you have seen the too many hours we had put forth in this study preparing for this moment so Lord I'm just inviting you now that you would come Lord you'll do your part as I've done mine and Lord you will anoint the ears of the hearer tonight Lord that we can hear what this Spirit would have to be said we just commit ourselves to you tonight father what a great opportunity we have to serve you distrust that you'll speak now in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles this evening we're going to look in several places in Scripture tonight we'll start hearing John John 1 very familiar scripture reading for us all trust you've had a good week so far all right well praise the Lord some of you halves some of you still figuring it out that's okay that's what the midweek is all about still trying to figure it out the Bible would tell us in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God in verse 14. notice in the word that was in the beginning that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you can have your seats this evening and I just want to speak to you just for a little bit let me start my timer I want to speak to you on the word we'll bring forth after his kind notice after his kind so the Bible says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so let's turn to Genesis and go back to the beginning and look at some scriptures here in Genesis 1 verse 11 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and Herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and notice now and it was so so God spoke the word and the Word was so so God honored his word he believed it when he spoke it and it manifested and the Earth brought forth grass verse 12 and Herb yielding seed after his kind take notice how many times in this short passage he says after his time and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good verse 20 and God said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that he hath and the fowl that may fly above the Earth in the open firmament of heaven and God created great wells in every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every wing foul after his kind and God saw that it was good verse 24 and God said let the Earth bring forth living creatures after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so in verse 25 and God made the Beast or the Earth after his kind and the cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the Earth after his con and God saw that it was good so now God has created he's created all the animals he's created all the botany life he's created everything but there's one thing missing in God's creation he has yet to create an image of himself but we find here in verse 26 God was not yet done with his creation he says now God said let us make man in our image notice after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth and so God created Man In His Image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them another scripture reading Romans 8 and verse 11 before we get started this morning this evening I got enough pages of notes Here we could start this morning Romans 8 11 says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit notice that dwelleth in you amen this all going to be all right tonight so we're going to speak to you just for a little bit the word now notice the word will bring forth after his kind so when we look in John and we find it says in the beginning was the word that brother bam tells us that he said the root form or the root from which we get the translation for word is logos so in the beginning was the logos and the word logos means a thought or a concept it has a double meaning means start or speech now he says think about it expressed thought becomes a word he goes isn't that wonderful and beautiful John says that the concept of God was expressed in Jesus then we find in the seven churches that he said then we come to Jesus the low gospel he was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word see that is what he is and he forever will be but it says he has chosen Us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means right with him in the mind in the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world you and I were in God's thoughts so that gives an eternal quality to the elect he says you can't get away from it so if we look at that we were chosen in him in Jesus before the foundation of the world and we go back to Genesis God said let us make man in our image so God already had in his thoughts God already had in his mind and now Not only was it in his thoughts now he spoke the word let us make man in our image after our likeness so what does that mean that means that we're just as Eternal as Christ is eternal because when God saw Christ he saw you in him and he chose you then and there and then we find in Ephesians 1 he says blessed be the God our father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places and we know that Heavenly places is the believer's position in Christ notice now verse 4 according as he has chosen us so now we're chosen in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so the word of God no matter how long it may Tarry no matter how long that seed may lay dormant that word is going to come to life because God has already spoken that word and We Know by the teachings of the scriptures that the word of God shall not will not return to him boy but it will accomplish that which it was purpose in the message the spoken word now brother Branham would take from the spoken word is the Original Seed he actually goes into Genesis 1 and it begins to start at the creation and he says that spoken word is the original seat so when God spoke in the beginning he spoke you into existence though you didn't come to the seventh Church age God already knew the thoughts that he had for you see he said the word of God is eternal God being infinite he cannot speak one thing and later change and have something else a better decision because every decision of god is perfect see once his word is spoken it can never die he'll lives on and on and on and on it can never die because it is of god his word can no more die than he can die and I'm here to tell you tonight you cannot die because you're yoked with him because when he thought of Christ he he put your name there with him and therefore that word that spoke Jesus is the same word that's speaking life to you tonight and you can't die no matter what comes your way no matter how the enemy attacks you no matter how he bump at you you're gonna Outlast the enemy because you were a very a very thought in the mind of God but for the foundation of the world before mama and daddy ever thought of conceive it you were in the thoughts of God and those thoughts are eternal Hallelujah so once his word was spoken it can never die it lives on and on and on he said that's the reason we find in first John in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh the same word that was spoken in the beginning with his eternal purpose came over and was made flesh and dwelt Among Us it was God's word so when a man is born of the spirit of God he becomes inwardly he becomes in the image of God thankfully it's an inner work first that flows on the outside if we sing that song Jesus on the inside working on the outside I'm glad to know it's not Jesus on the outside trying to get to the inside but as Jesus working in the core of our heart and a soul realm to do what to manifest that word so that that seed that he placed there before the foundation of the world when it comes in contact with the word that is being preached in this hour what happens that seed begins to to Quicken and become alive and then now that Life of Christ begins to flow out of you it's not something brother Mike that you got to work it up something that you got to go in and you got to practice and you got to make yourself perfect and and do a bunch of do's and a bunch of adults and oh I got to be legal here and I got to be legal it ain't about working your way to heaven it ain't about working your way to God no the work has already been done God had placed a seed on the inside all that you've got to do is believe that the word is for you and let that work quick in that sea and that life on the inside of that sea will begin to manifest in your life so we find now the word the world was made by the word of God those pews that you're sitting on tonight was made by the word of God you said well God made the Pew no God made the wood that made the pew he spoke trees into existence and so God believed his own word and his word began to materialize and if he can do that for a tree what about for you and me what about for your your your your sons and your daughters what about our prodigals some of you so worried about your product about your son about your Wayward Daughter think about this word the prophet of God would tell us in one one place he said a Son of God can go a long time before he ever recognizes that he's a son do you realize that there's seas in the world today that have been that's been around for 2 000 years some Ten Thousand Years a seed laid Dormer for ten thousand years but once that seed is put in the right atmosphere once that seed is put in the right position in the right climate and the right anointing and the right word and the right everything that seed begins to manifest a life that was on the inside from the very beginning and what am I telling you it may be a bar room but God can still Quicken the sea he could be in a car after somebody just cusses a man swear it could be right there then and there that the light comes inside that vehicle and Quicken the seed it could be a water tower it could be somebody trying to commit suicide and the voice drops down says turn your car around what does it do it quickens the seed they may go years brother Brown they they when he went beyond the curtain of time and this young lady came up to him oh our precious brother and he said you don't remember her Duty he says no he says who was that he said she was past 90 when you led her to the Lord look how long that sea laid dormant but I'm going to tell you a Praying Mother and a praying father was praying for a 90 year old but at the right time in the right atmosphere that was life that was already inside that sea let me tell you that seed can go to a sinner's grave that seed can go to a devil's Hill because why because God has spoke that sea and that seed had life in it and he'll bankrupt Heaven tonight to make sure that that seed of his will come to life don't worry about your particle you commit him to God and trust that they are see and God will do his part notice he said let the Earth bring forth and the Earth brought forth let it bring forth everything after its kind this word kind there is species now I'm going to go through some definitions and I'm not trying to belittle anybody here so please know that I'm just working on my teaching skills so this word kind means species and the phrase after its kind means that light produces like somebody should say hallelujah light produces like kind produces kind species produces the exact same species they don't intermingle with one another so the theory of one species being developed from another species is denied we find that it's been exposed because see God created every species distinct from one another botany life does not intermingle with foul life whales of the ocean do not intermingle with mammals that walk upright I know I've been what we find here that everything produces increases and multiplies after its kind if you want rice and you plant rice guess what you're going to get rice if you like mangoes and you plant a mango tree you're going to get mangoes and if you are a human and I trust that everyone that's here tonight is you're going to bring forth more human life you're not waiting for the sonogram to find out what kind of animal you're going to have because you know there's a law that's been placed and it's put parameters out there this species must bring forth of its kind if you're not worried about bringing some other form to life you know that I'm a human therefore when I conceive and give birth it's going to be another human so nowhere in history of this planet that this law has ever been challenged or changed because God set the parameters in the beginning and we're still Lotus now we're still true sons and daughters are still holding true to those same parameters but we understand that the devil has came in this age to disrupt the plan of God so notice now it's God's ordered system instituted and established by him at creation it cannot change because God's word cannot change it's already been spoken I say hallelujah no matter how I feel it ain't based on how I feel I'm a Son of God no matter what I'm going to be in His image no matter what I've done it doesn't matter what I've done the blood pleads that the blood clears that the blood acts as the cleansing agent acts as a Clorox you can take that Clorox the blood of Jesus Christ and put one sin in there and it abolishes that that sin and it goes all the way back to the head of your accuser so we find out life comes from the seed amen whether it be botany life whether it be animal life whether it be human life all life comes from a seed now notice what is a seed every seed carries within it all the potentials and the promise of what it can become all Seas carry within it all the potentials see my son has potentials he's already outgrown those potentials I'm five foot six and a half and some of you may question that he's five foot eight five foot nine he's outgrown those potentials but everything that's in me is in him so we find so notice the seed carries the Prototype of what it will be the scene is basically a copy notice now a seed has all the information that it needs to grow into a complete healthy plant healthy animal or a human so everything replicates of itself everything replicates after its own kind that would replicate means it's going to be an exact copy an exact how many have ever seen twins they're an exact copy maybe it's one slight difference that you really have to pay attention to and if you're the parent you're the one that knows otherwise you're calling somebody by the wrong name because it's replicated as an exact copy so the life is contained in the seed in that life once it's manifested produces fruit take for instance an apple seed every Apple that's ever in that seed once it's planted and grows into an apple tree every Apple that will ever live on that tree is in that seed I'm trying to tell you now every attribute of God is already in you it's all laying there it's just got to be Quicken you just got to be coming to the presence of the Lord coming to the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and allow the power of God allow the anointing of the spirit to rain down on that sea don't push back on the anointing don't push back on the sea or the the rain but allow the rain to come and Quicken the sea and though the brother man would tell us in one place give the seed the word test see what they believe see if they're seed or not if you can receive it it shows that you are Sons and Daughters of God and the quickening power of the word comes to do what to Quicken the seed and that the spirit of Christ be in you it will Quicken your mortal body so we think about human life you and I are created in the image of God amen I know some days you wake up and you don't feel like it some days you just don't feel like a son of God but nevertheless the word is already spoken every seed is going to come after his kind God is going to have seed notice you are created to function in his Divine environment God created you to function in the Realms of the supernatural we're not only a mass of Flesh I know sometimes we feel that way don't we you have a bad day you're discouraged you're depressed you're beat down with anxiety and fears and you feel like nobody cares you're not good enough you're never going to amount to anything you just feel like just a Great Big Blob of nasty flesh but you're not the Bible tells us that we're Spirit soul and body we are a powerful creation of God we're the highest form of God's creation so notice now every trait that will ever be manifested in the life of a human being is already in the sperm every attribute the color of your eyes the complexion of your skin and I know some of us we try to go to that Tan in bed and you know we want to put on that nice tall dark and hand I'm already I'm wiped out all the way around short Stumpy and cute there ain't no tall dark and handsome here I don't miss all that I got in the wrong line when they was passing out genetics but we find everything is already in that sperm in that seed the color of your eye the complexion of your skin the color of your hair how tall you'll be well my case how short you'll be how much hair you'll have or not have notice also your personality your makeup whether you're going to be somebody that's going to be loving in gentle or mean and Stern firm and hard or somebody that's driven or somebody that's lazy and lackadaisical see all these attributes already in the seed and the seed determines the attributes of what that individual becomes so now I say that to say if that's the natural seed and the natural proceed possesses all the attributes that lays in the individual what about the spiritual seed what about the seed that God deposited inside of your heart before the foundation of the world if that seed that's natural can determine everything about you then I'll say what about the seed of God when that seed is being quickened then everything that God was it's already in you just waiting to be manifested to be Sons and Daughters of God to have overcoming power to have the word at your fingertips that you can speak and the word will manifest just as if you're the same as almighty God so notice now remember the sea carries the potentials and everything that God is is potentially in you waiting to be expressed well bam tells us in diseases and afflictions he says every life every bit of Life there is came from a germ you yourself are from a germ of life you came one time you were just a teeny little germ so small that you couldn't be seen by natural eye but you came from your father your see nothing your mother's blood at all the blood cells come from the male sex and then from that germ it becomes to multiplying cells and everything is after it's kind of germ from a dog will bring forth a dog a bird would bring forth a bird and a human will bring forth a human if nothing interrupts it it's going to take my time this evening so the word of God is a seed we find that Luke 8 and verse 11 that said deceit is the word of God and the seed is planted in the ground at that seed is watered it Springs forth to life if it's German if it's a germatized see notice now then if the seed has fallen into your heart and you'll water that seed by faith it'll bring forth just after its kind that's why someone you need a camp experience to get in the right atmosphere so that that seed can be quickened so some of you need a church experience so you can get in the right atmosphere I know sometimes it's hard to come to church on a Wednesday night after working two and a half days or three days and you're worn out and you're tired but if you do that not to see everybody I hope but you come because why because you need parts of that seed to be manifested to being attributes out of your life and he needs you to be here because somebody's going to manifest the very attributes that he has and so in order to express those attributes you must get into an atmosphere to where those potentials can be developed but bro man will say it takes the spirit of God the seed to give eternal life he says my you know people think brother Brown didn't get excited they ain't listening to the same tapes that I'm listening to so now every seed after is kind and you cross that seed up it cannot bring back to itself again so he begins to go into high breeding and we find in Genesis 3 the First Act of hybriding took place then and there when Eve believed the LIE of The Serpent and took his seed into her womb and once that seed came into her womb therefore she stepped out of Eternity she came into an atmosphere of time and now no longer could she bring forth of the spoken word now she was going to bring forth of human desires so now this word hybrid means it means an offspring of two animals or two subspecies two different breeds two different varieties two different species two different genres relating to are produced from parents of different species variety and breeds you say well how in the world did that happen God made it he made a law everything is going to come forth after its kind but the serpent was so subtle he was so much like man but he didn't have a soul and we find in the message condemnation by representation the serpent was a man and the blood of an animal won't mix with the blood of a human no sir but this specie was so close between there until he did mix and Satan knew that so sin did not start in heaven it began on the earth he was kicked out talking about Satan and there there was nothing else that could get into the animal was too far from him so the seed would not mix so he got into the serpent which was being more like man and when God cursed him he put him on his belly and he changed every bone in him science is still trying to dig up those bones to find that Missing Link but he says now the serpent was most subtle and he most shrewd and cunning wisdom smarter than any of the other animals he was right next to man the most subtle of the beasts of the field so why did Satan do that because Satan was trying to stop that predestinated spoken word seed from being manifested in this hour because Satan was there when God said let us make man in our image Satan was there he knew the purpose and the plan of God that God intended and had desires to have a family in order to have that family he was going to have to bring seed and he was at the quick and see and that sea was going to have to manifest the very attributes of God and Satan right there he desired to pervert the family of God he desired to prevent those seeds from coming to life so he was there and noticed he injected his own seed into Humanity so he couldn't create but he could pervert and so because he couldn't create he got right next to man took on that image began to speak lies to Eve Eve stepped out from behind the word her protection and she believed the LIE of the enemy and she received his seed into her womb hybrid so now we're living in the day of the greatest perversion of humanity or age of great deception how many can say Amen to that man wants to be women how many of you men want to be a woman please don't raise your hand tonight please please please please please women want to be men notice now children they want to be cats and dogs zebras giraffes where are we at in society and not only that but the sad part is there's laws that protect and support this type of perversion and it's not just centralized in the United States but it's a worldwide perversion see Satan has implemented forced sterilization which allows individuals to reassign their gender or excuse me let me back up I misread that that's the transgender movement but for sterilization targets minorities and those that with those with disabilities so it comes in and you can if you were a minority or if you had a disability you can sterilize yourself or the government will sterilize you so that you don't bring forth more of your kind in 31 States already have laws that are for for sterilization but Satan just didn't stop there you noticed one thing he had the homosexual agenda the lgbqt and it's got every XYZ there with him and he wasn't just satisfied with that because now those even though they were homosexual if they decided to get their hearts right and God moved on them they could come back and they could still produce seed but the transgender movement what happens there is that you want to be a woman if you're a man and you're going to have a surgery and you have a sterilization that comes upon you one is the whole attempt that Satan's trying to do he's trying to block the seed of God from manifesting and now he's doing that by sterilization so that you can't bring forth but God's word has already been spoken God is going to bring forth of his kind he's going to have a bride and she's going to be born of his bone life of his life power of his power she is going to be him and ain't enough devils in hell can't stop it you can sterilize everything you want but this bride is coming forth she's going to Manifest this word and the word is going to bring forth Sons and Daughters of God notice now today children today can choose their gender based on how they feel versus their natural sexuality that they were born with this is all in an effort to destroy the predestinated seed from coming to life Satan is adamant that God will not have a family but God is more adamant that he will Satan is adamant that he's going to block that seed but Satan don't have enough he don't have I'm looking at seeds right here I'm looking at Sons and Daughters of God right here he don't have it why are you here tonight notice now in John 14 the Bible would tell us in verse 10 believeth thou not that I am in the father and the father and me and the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sake for verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me and the works that I do shall he do also in Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father so the works are the fruit so the works are the fruit bearing witness that you are in fact an offspring of God it is proof that you do believe and the message the spoken word is the Original Seed for the Bible says now it works manifested see it's the same for us the same word if you want to do the works of Christ do the same things that he done he that believeth on me in the in my Works what is that belief now notice what this Believers means believe it that he is the Original Seed germ that come otherwise he's saying you believe it that he was the original seed that was planted in the Garden of Eden you believe that and you'll also find yourself in him because when he spoke that seed he spoke every seed here tonight and you got to find yourself in the same works that he did you're going to do also and greater because now it's a multi-member body here tonight but we find he Eve hybrid and she mixed it and she crossed the the species line and it's caused every heartache it's caused every ambulance every hospital that was ever built every doctor's clinic that was ever built it was all because eve took in a lie of the enemy and anytime you take in the law of the enemy it causes the seed of God to be malnourished or it stunts that seed from growing that's why we got to pull down imaginations pull down everything that exalts itself against the word of God and allowed that word his word to manifest in and through your life so he was God made flesh speaking about Jesus he died in order to pay the debt of your high breeding I say thank you Lord I couldn't pay my debt but he paid it I didn't have enough money enough credit enough this that or the other but he paid my debt and now I have become him he took my sins and I could take his righteousness so the word is a seed and as long as it's laying there it won't do nothing he put a seat up here tonight Pepsi to stay there and lay dormant dormant dormant dormant dormant but you put that seat in the right ground put that seat in the right atmosphere give that seed the right amount of s-u-n light and see what happens to that seed that's why the Bible will tell us if the spirit that was in him be in you it's going to do the same thing it did to him it's going to Quicken that seed it's going to Quicken your mortal bodies so when God brother Pam says now when God was made in his first bridegroom he was made the bridegroom first and he was both man and woman and the spirit formed in the dust of the earth to make him material and notice now when he made Eve from Adam he took not another piece of clay but he took from the same piece of clay the same word for Adam was a spoken word notice you're not a creating another another piece of clay but you came from the very heart of God and God spoke when God thought about having Jesus as a son and he would be the Savior you are part of that same clay that same that same Humanity or that same uh spirit and so he spoke to us and he said he brought Eve outside or from Adam a rib from Adam and what did he do he created him a helpmate he wasn't another piece of clay or she wasn't another piece of clay she was from the very substance that Adam was from and I'm going to tell you tonight Brothers you are from the very that almighty God is from you're from the spoken word of God and the spoken word is the Original Seed and that seed is going to manifest so the bride must also be flesh of his flesh bone of his bone then how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh because it's going to be his spirit his spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead is also going to Quicken our mortal bodies and raise us from the dead in John 1 we find here in verse 10 said he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not now we read earlier that in the beginning was the word the logos the concept of God the perfect concept of God that was expressed and now we find that he was in the world and the world was made by him in the world didn't even know him he came unto his own and his own didn't even receive him but come on everybody looking at the screen but as many as received him receive what received that seed to them gave he the power to become sons of God even to them that believed on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of Flesh nor the will a man but of God see you're born of God when you're born again so the spirit the spirit doesn't Quicken every seed it only quickens the predestinated seed just in this man I mean that's what you need to run around why are you here because you're predestinated seed I said the spirit doesn't Quicken every seed that's why you see perversion out in the land that's why you see transgender in the transgender movement and lgbtq movement and all this movement and you hear this this shooting here and this shooting here and this here and this here that's not predestinated see but I'm speaking to predestinated spoken word see tonight that's why you're here because the spirit has quickened that sea and it's bringing that seed to life oh you may not be where you want to be but look back over your life at least ain't where you used to be God is going to work in your life and God is here tonight to continue that work to bring that seed to full manifestation I say Oh Glory to God tonight God's ain't done with me yet you're still working on me I'm here Lord to display the attributes of my heavenly father because you predestinated me to be a son and daughter of God those that were in the thoughts of God in the back part of his mind that's who the spirit is coming to Quicken now I know there's people they don't believe in predestination shame on them because the Bible does notice the predestinated one of course like to see delayed upon the Earth the one that had life in them many of them were dead they were just rotten seeds Waters thrown through and burned them out but you know there was a real sea laying there for the life God knowed it was laying there the predestinated ones are the first to be quickened by the Holy Spirit see the Holy Spirit comes to claim its own Justin that's why you couldn't go and keep going the route that you was going and living the life that you were living that's why it had to be an intervention when you said well it's because a little a little 16 year old girl came forward and had prayer yes because God quickened the life on the inside of her the crowd for you because God had already deposited inside of you that see Gene of life and no matter how far you ran you couldn't run past the hand of God but with the hand of God couldn't reach down and bring you back in your pajamas and you've been different ever since the saint there's old desires that you used to have you don't have any more wine because God came down and he quickened deceived from the field of viewers looking at a water tower that water tower changed your world it wasn't a water tower it was a seed on the inside you ran from God and ran from God and ran from God but God deposited a predestinated seed and that water tower took that that that that that blindness off of your eyes that Amnesia that you had and it broke the sin that was on your life and it quickened the sea that was on the inside and why are you here tonight because the seed brother Mike has been quickened by the message of the hour that's why we're here because seeds Sons and Daughters of God had been quickened and the word is bringing forth it's bringing forth It's been spoken hella High Water Sons and Daughters of God will be manifested in this hour somebody's gonna take a rapture it's been spoken the sun was sent across as U.N was sent across the Earth not to bring rocks which was dirt also to life it was not to bring all the dirt to life but it was to bring the part of the dirt which was enclosed around a life we wonder why sometimes life is life was awful don't you ever feel like dirt is this pout all over you okay maybe I'm just let me get a mirror and I'll just preach to myself man you feel so overweighted I like seeing everything is on top of Satan trying to cover that cedar depression anxiety fears nervousness heartaches heart trouble and all this Cancer all this one thing after the other to do what to stop the seed I say pile it on Big Boy because all you're doing is creating the right atmosphere because all I gotta do is come into the presence of a living God and let the sunlight of that word begin to speak because already you don't put me in the right atmosphere I can't get no further down than I already am now I'm looking up what am I looking up for because I'm looking for the son that's Owen to Quicken this see and draw me up to himself so that what was inside of me is going to manifest out of me oh what am I telling you tonight I'm telling you no matter what you're going through no matter how stupid this sin you may be tonight God has deposited a seed there and there ain't enough Devils there ain't enough sin there ain't enough unbelief that can keep that seed down God is determined that that predestinated seat will manifest I say glory to God tonight Hallelujah brother sister Satan you don't have enough to keep sons and daughters have gone down we're coming forth the word is speaking for sons in this hour thank you oh Hallelujah excuse me for my excitement no you don't I'm happy this way you know I alone in my study as I was looking at this I said no don't get excited don't get excited slow it down a little bit I'm sorry it excites me my goodness some of y'all don't know what I used to be my mom and dad were here they'll tell you what I used to be gotta tell you what I used to be but see God only remember that anymore nor does he remember what you used to be he didn't put it as we heard on Sunday it's in the sea and it's still falling everything that you were still falling all those sins are still falling all that unbelief is still falling why because God is manifesting notice that what he says now so it didn't the sun that's you it didn't come to Quicken the rocks it didn't quite come to Quicken the dirt but it come notice now it come to bring the part up that dirt which was enclosed around the life otherwise around that seed and not all men will receive Christ oh no but those which were ordained of God see it's housed around some of that dirt of this Earth that's the one that he comes to Quicken they're the ones now that dirt will lay there in the sun brother Mike you know what that dirt will say man this is Louisiana it's too hot That Rock that Rock is oh it's just too hot in Louisiana it's a hundred degrees and that ain't even with the heat temperature or the heat index but what does the sea say the sea says that's what I'm looking for oh let me tell you some people want to say oh this message is too tough this message is too scorching this message is too hot but that predestinated seats that's exactly what I want that's exactly what I need I need it hard I need it tough I need it right I need it first I need it right in the middle I need it done Quicken me I say glory to God tonight Quicken us Lord it ain't too hot for me the Sun was sent to Quicken the seed and God sent us a message to Quicken the seed that's why not everybody can receive it it's not for everybody so don't go out of here tonight thinking that uh you're not saved go ahead and pull that lie down speak about Cain and Abel somebody's always going to be the Cain I'm not preaching a cane tonight I'm preaching Abel I'm preaching the Sons and Daughters of God think about Judas and Jesus oh I'm gonna be hung upside down and this is it I'm Judas no you're not Judas quit thinking that I would say negativity but y'all take me wrong if I say that word at least some of you will but I'll get the negativity out of your mind and allow the word to Quicken allow the word to penetrate your complexes allow the word to penetrate your own beliefs say yeah I am a son of God yeah I am a daughter of God I may have been drifting I may have been going through life for a long time but something speaking to your heart tonight what is that that's a word that's the s-o-n twine trying trying to Quicken the seed that's on the inside he's going to Quicken that seed fight all you want take all your wrong scream all you want but the seed is coming come on Mom and Dad that seed is coming that prodigal is coming that wife is coming that husband is coming that Mom is coming that her or that father is coming no matter how much they kick how much they scream the word has already been spoken over him hella high water let me tell you tonight it's coming because God's word will not shall not and cannot return to him boy I say oh blessed be the name of the Lord tonight we're children on the most high God and God has got our back and he's the host of The caption of the Lord's army tonight and no matter what we Face how we face it the word of God will defeat Satan any time any place on any condition I say back up Satan sons and God are here tonight we're here tonight to do one thing to manifest the life of the seed my mama I probably on page two notice now foreign says the Holy Spirit comes now of course why won't all people receive it it wasn't sent to them see God told me I don't believe I don't care what you say if you could raise up the dead or anything and heal the sick and prove it anyway I still don't believe it I said certainly not you're an unbeliever he goes notice he says now it don't mean a thing to you it wasn't sent to you it was sent to those who will believe see the message is to the believer to them that perish is foolishness but to them that are in Christ and part of that seed is life and we find in Matthew 24 and 24 there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and they should show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they should deceive the very elect now notice this is in take on the whole armor of God he said better be careful now the Antichrist shall be so close to the seed the very late what is the elect when the light shines upon the s-o-n or the s-u-m shines upon that that governed by the botany life it'll come to life and when the Son of God Shines on that predestinated seed it will come to life that quick he's just as soon I don't care what state of life it might be a prostitute it might be a drunker or a gambler it will shine at that minute as soon as it strikes him deceived the elected if it were possible but it's not possible to deceive the elect notice he come to redeem or to bring to life those predestinated seed that God seemed before the foundation of the world and he put their names on the Lamb's Book of Life and there notice now there in the earth without a hope he came not only to be a blessing but to bless that predestinated seed and if that seed wasn't on there it couldn't live it had to be on the earth also germatized no matter how long it's kept in darkness it'll come forth when the s-o-n shines upon it notice he come to share it with us I say oh blessed be the name of the Lord you are looking for God but the son found you that's the wind came down and broke the shackles that was on your life and now your sons and daughters of God don't fear anymore for every four ordained predestinated seat of God shall come to life when the light spreads across it I know I share this all the time but I was driving 120 miles an hour I didn't care to live I didn't know there was a seed on the inside I didn't grow up in a Christian home I didn't grow up in the message but God planted a seed there and a voice came down and said turn your car around because why because he was going to manifest he had a job he had a purpose he had a mission he had a desire I'm gonna use you I'm gonna use you to destroy Satan's kingdom I'm going to take your passion I'm going to take all that screaming all that slobber and all that spit and I'm gonna use your gift I placed a gift on the inside of you but for the foundation of the world only thing that I got to do is Quicken that seed and when that seed catches a hold of this message oh watch out Satan watch out Satan the sick could be healed Satan will be cast out signs of one is going to follow them but I believe what am I telling you to say the same God that did that for me is the same God that's here for you tonight the quick and the seed you may be going one way but all it takes for whenever the light strikes on that predestinated seed it will come to life yes indeed you can't keep it the Solar Sun up there the s-u-n has control over all botany when a seed is laying there and that son strikes it it has to come to life and the Son of God is the controller of all eternal life musicians make your way if you would and if you've got a seat of life in you brother when the son strikes there and shows you what he is it comes to life there is no way of keeping from it so I asked you tonight why are you here not just in the four walls of this church but why are you here why are you around this message why do you follow it why don't you put efforts in drive 10 11 12 13 hours to go to meetings if it's all fanatical why are you here sister Alicia our sister Felicia where my mind was going on that one sister Felicia why did you and brother L pack up why did you pack up everything that you knew all your comfort family telling you warning you don't go you're gonna go over there and be a part of an all-white church are you serious what are you thinking they wasn't thinking the seed was being quickened Jay think about it haul your buddies and all your friends back in Mississippi what what have you come all your white friends cousins telling you this and saying this and saying that you know you're black you can't be around all them whites in the natural that's true but the seed has been quickened that's why Jay you can travel hours in a group of all white boys and go to a camp meeting or go here and go there and not feel one ounce of racism because they love you just as much as you love them because they're not looking at the color of your the color of your skin they're looking at the content of your heart and inside of that heart is a seed of God that's been quickened by the word of the hour for the lingo why are you here think about it for years an alcoholic from a kid what was you eight years old 10 10 years old you drank for 30 something years wasn't it smoke drank party for 30 something years you wouldn't have gave him a chance I wouldn't have gave him a chance cause we can't see what God put on the inside oh I'm so glad sometimes church we just God looks beyond the natural eyes God looks beyond our Humanity but yet before the foundation of the world God deposited a seed on the inside of Lee goes strong he put a seed there on the inside and at a funeral service it was the unexpected place at an unexpected time God came down and spoke to him and tweaked in that seat and that's why he's here tonight because God made a promise I'm gonna bring forth no matter what it looks like no matter how it feels no matter how forgotten you may be I was gonna manifest my seed and it wasn't only for you but your son James and he thought he was just coming to work oh James look what God has done for you if there was no seed there there would be no there would be nothing changing on the outside but because there was a seed on the inside and God begins to work from the inside he begins to manifest from the inside he begins to materialize himself from the inside into the outside begins to display I am Assad I am a son oh you hear the word about cutting your hair and all of a sudden come back the next day 16 years you had long hair oh totes cut it all off oh you ain't had it short in a long time but you like it and we like it too why because you're displaying the attributes of a Son of God I sell glory to God tonight Satan wants to tell some of you you ain't gonna make it he's told your brother Roger you ain't gonna make it he's gonna sit there all alone but God put a seed there and at one point and one service you came by so I'm gonna try out even like Tabernacle and you've been here ever since why because I'm predestinated see what's the positive or the foundation of the world that's why we're here Church that's why we're here to benefit oh look we're not manifesting our own ideas there's enough of that in the world but we're manifesting the attributes that lay in the seed and everything that papa is everything that he is he poured it into the logos and when that logos came forth I said let us oh let us make man now in our image where the sin man has gone away I'm gonna have a pride she's gonna be born up my bone she's gonna be Flesh of My Flesh it's gonna be power of my power she will be me and I notice the church ain't bringing it forth padmus ain't bringing it forth Pentecost ain't bringing it forth denominations ain't bringing it forth let me just say William Branham ain't bringing it forward but God is bringing it forth the word is bringing forth of his kind aren't you thankful tonight aren't you thankful that you're his kind when you tried to quit you can't quit Aaliyah when you try to walk away you can't walk away because you're his kind [Music] the thoughts of God are eternal you're just as Eternal as God is eternal you can't quit you
