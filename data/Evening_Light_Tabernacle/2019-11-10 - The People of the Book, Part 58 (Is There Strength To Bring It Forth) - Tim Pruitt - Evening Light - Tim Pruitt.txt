a moment right now so we go to the Lord in prayer maybe you would just like to be remembered today as we pray and those needs that comes in sometimes we have those come in from only requests from over the internet a little sister from Indiana send in a request needs to has a need the Lord Jesus knows every situation dear Jesus as we bow before your throne of grace we're so thankful to know that you're working now you're not giving up on your people and that you have never failed to keep a promise we want to thank you that you're here and that you present your the same yesterday today and forever to live and your people to manifest your glory Lord you seen the needs of your people that reached out to you today you know their hearts cry as they've come in Lord from different places hearing from different ones around the world and throughout the u.s. Canada many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers them out of them all may they today know us deliver as Savior as Redeemer as lord I pray dear God that you'll bless your people has assembled with us today and those Lord that are assembled with us from all over the world different places they've already have their services Lord been to church but now here in the evening time as the hours are difference they're sitting there in their homes perhaps and they're just wanting to hear from you again Lord there's something about it Lord that we get a little touch from you we just can't get enough of you we want more of you and so Lord our hearts long for you for a living God and we believe that that's the way that you are your God that long for fellowship that you wanted our fellowship and so therefore you made a man in your image somebody that you could fellowship with and then we think of Jesus when he was here the what he the only thing he asked her father for was for our fellowship oh no God we're here today to give back that worship and fellowship back to you than to tell you that we love you Lord and that we're glad to be your children and I know that makes your heart glad but you would look over the children of Israel and say it's not laws and Commandments and the animal sacrifices and endless bloodshed that I desire but I just want this if you would just love me with all your heart with all your soul with all your might may it be today Lord that we love you with all that is within us as we surrender our lives to you Lord I surrender my life to you to minister today the minister life to the hearer I pray Lord that you'll just just solely ride on the words that I speak the anointing of the Holy Spirit that will go forth direct and every word to its mark speak in their ever life-changing us in your presence so we can be like the song says that old man is dead and I'm a new man in Christ Lord I pray you'll bless your people may the anointing be poured out today upon your people as we look to you now in the name of Jesus we thank you for a man amen god bless you you'll turn with me to Exodus chapter 23 we'll begin looking at verse 20 so good to see each one that is here what a welcome especially warm welcome to my brother Dan Pruitt who is with us this morning god bless you brother dan makes my heart glad to see you here and all of you that is assemble with us by the Nathan nice to have you and your wife with us today and your children god bless you nice than that I'm glad we could be a vacation spot amen most people don't think about going to Louisiana for vacation but hey we can be a vacation spot where we're really happy to have you a man good to be in the presence of the Lord together I was just there at his little church just a few weeks ago and we spent our 44th anniversary my wife and I they're in their little church just worshiping the Lord together and that's you know that's what it's all about we don't bum to ourselves anyway we belong to Jesus so we we had a wonderful time with them and just speaking to a lovely congregation packed out just a house full of believers there that had gathered in New Albany area so it was just wonderful to be with them god bless you and your service for the Lord it may he just energize you and strengthen you and give you a rest as you have these few days here and wherever you got leaves you and every person we just welcome you today and I hope you just feel welcome in the presence of the Lord those are on the internet some from South Africa telling me they'd be listening and God bless you Saints we love you and the Lord and you sojourn with us today in this service may the Lord speak to you directly let's let's look now at verse 20 Exodus chapter 23 behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in thy way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared that's sound wonderful Amen we've been speaking about returning you know the people of the book returning to the land of the book and remember God sent an angel I had to prepare the way a man to bring us into this place and and yet we we had a man a human angel if you want to speak of the messenger the Church of Laodicea you see John the Baptist was a messenger which is and Angelo's him so he was an angel that was sent from God but you know we had that not only just a an earthly angel we we have those supernatural angels that have went forth to bring preparation and that are here with us right now in this building this morning a man to bring you into the place that has been prepared for you and I think if you're lost you're confused if you're if you don't know the way around of your whatever this situation is in your life the angel of God is here the Holy Spirit to lead you right back to the fountain of life amen but beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not he will not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if our southern indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto the adversary for mine angel shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the hammerites into the hittites and the perizzites and the canaanites and the high writes and the jebusites and I will cut them off thou shall not bow down to their God not serve them neither do after their works but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images and you so said the Lord your God he he shall bless thy bread and that water and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee there shall nothing cast their young nor be barren in thy land the number of that days I will fulfill I will send my fear before thee and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come and I will make all that enemies turn their backs unto thee and I will send the Hornets before thee which shall drive out to highlight the Canaanite in the height Hittite from before thee I will not drive them out from before thee in one year lest they land become desolate and the beasts of field multiply against thee but little and little I will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land and I will set up bounds from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines and from the desert into the river for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand and thou shalt drive them out before thee and thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their gods doesn't they shall not dwell in thy land lest they make these sin against me for his ass they'll serve their gods it will surely be a snare unto thee and then I would like to turn to 2nd Kings chapter 19 we read from the 3rd verse and they say unto Him thus saith Hezekiah this is a day of trouble and a rebuke and blasphemy but the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth man may God bless you can as you can be seated we noticed here that God was making a promise to them send in the angel before them bringing back to the land that would flow with milk and honey in other words it would be a fruitful Ayana and then of course he said that he would bless our bread and I water I will take sickness from away from the midst of these so he promised divine healing in this land and amen the necessary needs that we have to be fulfilled and then he would say that he would send my fear before thee and and would destroy all the people to then come and your enemies would put their back to you and and they would run from you in other words and then he made clear that there would be no baron in the land that but it would be a fruitful land and that God would would turn the barren situation into fruitfulness wonderful thing that God is doing and then we find in the Book of Kings where we have just read it was day when Sennacherib would come down from Assyria and would come to fight against Judah and he would he would mock the God of Israel and tell them not to put any confidence in that God because he had he had destroyed all the gods of the other lands and then he tried to also convince Israel or that the people of Judah that Hezekiah by removing the high places and bringing them back to Jerusalem to worship that he and indeed had offended Jehovah himself and so therefore he was being sent by God himself dis Joe himself to bring destruction to them and of course there was all kinds of different things that he was was wanting to do he he made them to pay tribute and they was he was taking bribes from them and things to to satisfy his his wrath and but he said that I'm gonna come and I'm gonna take you away from this land and I'm gonna take you and put you in another it'll be a land that is a fruitful land and you'll prosper and but it won't be this land and so again when Hezekiah hears all this news and and hears all of this blasphemy against God as the heralds of the Sanitary of his his army would would come out and stand shout out all of these blasphemies and against God and against the king and against the Lord Himself that it would be that Hezekiah would become very troubled by this and he would take it to the Lord and then he say this is a day of trouble and a rebuke and a blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth now this is a kind of a proverbial expression meaning that a dangerous crisis approaches and that the nation has no strength to carry it through the peril that is coming and brother Branham told us that you know that we - were in a in the stage of birth pains that the world was in birth pains and that it was about to have been coming through the water in the days of Noah the blood in the days of Jesus and then the the spirit or the fire that would come that would baptize the world with fire cleanse it so the Spirit of God could come down upon it you know that that as the world had went to that process are going to that we was about ready for our last and final birth pains but then he comes around and he said the church is also in birth pains and that is to bring forth on the promise of the word Jesus Christ back to the earth again and of course as we're looking at this today as he the question or what it was coming was he said the children her come to birth but there is not strength to bring forth so he's he's like him in Israel their trouble took throat a travailing woman a woman that's in travail but she just she is us he's labored so long and and is now wore out and is unable to bring forth have that final push to bring that child into being and so my question today that as we look at these things I want to just pose a question to us knowing that we're here and I also another day of time of blaspheming where it's against the Word of God and day of rebuke and trouble and and every kind of threat of the enemy that wants to take in and now take us out of the promised land of the word and put us over in some denominational camp where there is no power and where there is no real strength of the word of God to sustain of people I would you to understand I'm asking the question this morning is there strength to bring forth you know Jesus asked the question will I find faith and this is where that he he said when the Son of man cometh will I find faith upon the earth well well I find someone who will believe will I find that that faith that is going to be needed in that hour to take a people over into the promised land and I just want to save today there must be a church that reproduces Christ that is of the same species of the same character and the same faith in the sermon um it is horizon of the son brother Branham would give the example of two luxury cars and he said it was a Cadillac with you know as he described that maybe what he and that time thought was a very luxurious car and it was for the time but a Cadillac with dull skin leather seats and you know diamond studs in the steering wheel and and polished hubs and filled with the best gasoline you know in other words loaded with Scripture theology but yeah that one of them had no spark to move down the road and the other of course had spark so you know again when we when we look at this car for a moment it was a car that was what they say a Ford is you know for Dean they used that as acronym was found on the road dead now some of you Ford lovers won't love that but I drove to church and the Ford so don't get mad at me but but nevertheless you know we you know found on the road dead and somehow somehow this is what we find with with so much of Christianity today it's just it's just found on the road dead there's no life in it there's no power in it there's nothing that really save a man from his sins but yet he has to live in his sins and so he just in that dead that condition but I'll tell you I I'm believing that God's gonna have a place somewhere right around the world I'm not just talking about a local assembly but a place in the Bride of Christ around the world where that that she won't be found on the road dead but she'll be found in this last day alive those who are alive and remain at the coming of the Lord that will not hinder the resurrection what a what a promise that is to us now as we think about somebody he's found on the road dead some of them are worth billions and it will set thousands upon thousands of members some of my ornate stained glass and fancy pews and and ER they're the drivers who get behind the wheels are phd's and and you know a doctors of divinity and on and on and on but it does nowhere it cannot move down the road to divine healing it can't take you down to real deliverance and to real salvation and move you on to the rapture but rather is stranded and unable to move man now I'll tell you what I'd rather than having a car like that there's a dream car I'd rather have an old jalopy that would run that would take you down somewhere wouldn't you man it's more important to have Sparky and the power with it within that engine to take you down the road now brother madam would tell you in the it is horizon the Sun in his illustration he said the gasoline represents the word so it's full of the word it's the truth it but it's without the spirit it won't move and man and then he says and this is kind of gonna be the key to what we're talking about this morning we put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamics and he said it needs the dynamic power of God the resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon the church to manifest and to bring to pass that this is gasoline hey man it might be in a gasoline can but it should still be water but the only proof of it is put life on it and then approved whether it's gasoline or not so now if we want to know if we've really got the world if we will really have received the word will it take us down the road will it take us to deliverance will it take us to the power of God will it take us down to divine healing will it take us on to rapture hey man that's the question brother branham assay we put too much stress on the mechanics we put too much stress on the body getting it right and polished and looking pretty and looking nice and we don't put enough on the dynamics I don't believe brother Brandon was against having a nice church and then sitting in Nice Tuesday they built two Tabernacles during his lifetime bill what did they the new and over the old one they're trying to make things better nicer for people to sit and and who lured with our condition and so on and on and on knives in the building he wasn't against that but what he wanted was there was not so much emphasis on how nice of church is because a church without life is a dead church a man we must have the life of God in every service I'll tell you I don't ever meet in vain I won't ever service to be powerpack packed with the life of God the Holy Spirit moving from the pulpit to the back.you I'm on but now he would say there has been churches and churches and brides brides and churches brides bride but there's got it someone hallelujah there's gotta come the real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but there but the dynamics of it that makes the church live and move in the power of his resurrection but until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hub what good does it do to give her a facelift well our simonize job when there's no dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there has to be the dynamics to make it work and I'll tell you the same thing you know some people will criticize because you have a nice church and a nice building and a nice place the works have been but they'll sit down in some little jalopy of a building or a little wreck of a place and a little storefront thinking that they're there holier than everybody else because they're so humble and they don't have no power of God and there's no healing and there's no delivers a man the building isn't what counts and the what counts is the Holy Spirit moving in that church demonstrating his glory among his people that's what counts amen all all the other isn't bein a man oh yeah you know I I had a guy used to come to church when we were when we were in and all abandoned building that hadn't had Church in it for 15 years and and you know we had swept up buckets full or basketballs at wasp in it and we had old bowel heaters made out of drum barrels and pipes out the window to burn and try to have a little heat in the building we had an outdoor toilet because we didn't have indoor facilities we didn't have water it's a place we and we had six like bugs and who won that one plug in and this man would always come to me and he said back to those little dimly lit places you know we got to get back we got to get back to how far back dimly lit do you wanna get you need to look around I mean we got we got rusty gold pews that that get splinters in you when you slide down them and you know we we freeze on one side and burn on the other you know there's no convenience there's no air conditioning how much more rustic do you want a man but you see he thought they're getting a little more arresting what get him into God but I'll tell you that I'll get you to God I might what gets you to God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost power Jesus Christ that makes you live right walk right talk right [Applause] hey man I remember sitting in a in a kitten folks place you know one time when I was a young boy and seeing an old old car had a hand wiper that you wiped like this and the skids get in there and drives that old set course it didn't move but we could pretend that we were going down the road a man and it was an old no car that had been left to set and the tires were were rotted and run down it with nothing would move nothing would crank but buddy we could pretend but what I do here so that we don't want to pretend we're having church a man we don't want to have a bunch of pretense that this is the message just because it's in a gasoline can of a building called church and what we want is the power of God the spark of the Holy Ghost that black night the word that is preached otherwise if it isn't being ignited it might as well be water but it's been prophesied that there is a people who is strength to bring forth let me just read you a prophecy this is from spoken words original seed and he says know what here's what I'm trying to say to you the lawn reproduction bring forth of its kind Genesis 111 these last days true church bride comes to the headstone will be a super church a man a super race and she nears the great headstone there will be so much like him so much like him until that will be in his very image as an order to be united with him there will be one that will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God a man now of course you know today there there can be a lot of bringing forth the members that can be okay we can bring both beautiful buildings we can bring forth even great sermons but what about bringing sons of the word a people who know their God and who do exploits now of course as we look at this we're gonna look into some prophecies of the last day if you just will because this will tell you a little day a bit about the day of blasphemy and rebuke now Jesus is on his way to Calvary so as we're as we're turning to Luke 23 27 let me preface this by saying this he was being led away to be crucified now we know Jesus was the word and there he was he was being crucified not because daddy he didn't that he did something wrong but because that he went against the preconceived ideas of the religious systems of that day and so as he has led away to be crucified we break in on the scene in verse 27 at Luke 23 and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also be wailed and lamented him but Jesus turning in to them said daughters of Jerusalem we not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children for behold the days are coming in which they shall say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the paps which never gets up and then they shall begin to say to the mountains fall on us and onto the heels cover us for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry in other words if they do this kind of thing to the innocent what are we happen when we wouldn't when there in the days when they're guilty now so as we're looking at this for a moment brother Branham would explain this scripture and it is a whole different light and what most theologians look at it because he said it speaks of a day where women wouldn't want no more children and man they want a dog or a chat or something like that but she doesn't want children anymore now let me just before we go further any further there's nothing wrong with owning a dog or a cat and enjoying a pet I've had many of them through my life and and we're not condemning that so let's get that thought out of your head right now but here's here's what we want to bring it down to because we're talking that straight to bring forth and he said that there was he was this was speaking of a day that women wouldn't want no more children they want a dog or cat or something like that but she doesn't want children anymore why she's old Mother Hubbard if she has a child she didn't want to that's a remark so Hollywood it don't want some mothers his woman to be an old Mother Hubbard so he'll have some operation or she will performed himself for her to keep them from having children they don't want no more children and Jesus spoke heaven and said what did he and what did he say at that time that will begin begin to cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall on them she'll practice birth control so she can go to parties she can't be bothered with a baby nursing her in this farmer and when she's pregnant they'll be deforming deformers he won't look like she used to and her husband is ignorant enough to let her go that way she won't give him a child and Jesus spoke of it and he said that what they were doing this at that time they will go to crying in for the rocks to fall on them it's the coming of the Lord and they'll pay great sums for cats and dogs to mother that's right she must mother something because it is a god-given nature so now even and we're talking about a society today you know motherhood is thing that is now looked down upon a homemaker is something that is unwanted you know the womanís who are sees unfulfilled to raise children you know she she should be career minded and you know I mean everything is exploiting a woman in a wrong position and make them the firefighters in the end on the military and you know make them you know the Amazon Queen out here fighting and then the man you know on the other hand has been feminized are you with me in his masculinity taken away while the woman takes on that masculinity because it's an hour of perversion the Bible said it would come this way as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man so you see this idea not to have human babies but to have parent but the parent fur babies instead has captured the imagination of the young adults and others in this generation man I just read an article about the Millennials a generation that depends on technology and Anna's poem and is politically opinionated and aware of climate change and her walk in their understanding society and culture and politics and environment and since perhaps their need to foster animals Trump's procreation for a socially conscious reason or maybe they're just second generation hippies who would prefer to stay independence to being bogged down by parental responsibilities or sorts simpler they just like being pet parents so the one that went on to talk about that now this generation should be called Generation Rex and if you're wondering why the playgrounds in the city are quite and the dog runs are packed a new report has an answer more and more us women are for foregoing motherhood and getting their maternal kicks by owning handbag size canes canines sorry tines do they know the difference but the data from this Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed that a big drop in the number of babies born to women aged 15 to 29 corresponds with a huge increase in the number of tiny pooches that are owned by young u.s. women and and said dog crazy New York ladies told the Post they aren't surprised by the findings that they happily give up diaper changes temper tantrums and college funds for the easy affection of their doggy child so you know the Millennials are are opting out for pets and not Parenthood and they explain why because you know the dogs need heaps of love and attention but not constant monitoring like a human child and it isn't considered an abuse of our legal practice to leave your puppet home alone when you head off to work and parents don't have the luxury to do this with the child and those kids have to be watched all the time you know this insanity gets worse in the recent news here lately a woman you know of course she did admit to happen mental trouble and for her mental capacity you know she was suing her her homeowners association because they forbid her to have chickens and she had four pet chickens which were prescribed to her to help cope with her stress and the soul she said her girls are her life sound like people that went to the chickens you know they're there again I mean we're living in an insane world where people can't tell what's right from wrong we have a whole generation that exhausts the creation about the create and they will do this and we'll see them you know elevating animal rights over human rights and their worship because the Bible said in the book of Romans that in the last days they were worship the creation over the Creator so it's not been taught in our art schools and by esteemed educators you know where where they they promote animal rights then and so on that and it fosters these ideas that are coming out now and annum kind of real catchy among the world that we live in beyond me than the impossible burger and it's an attempt to make meet my man in order to stop or limit animal as useful food because it calls that abuse and the reason part is is because men are now worshipping the curry a that the creation rather than the Creator and then of course as you look into this many of you don't realize but there's an underlining um thing that it's bringing the world together and the religions of the world are even binding together for the good of mankind because of the environment and climate change becomes the tool for bringing the two religions of the world into a one-world government you know and the Tobii is if you don't love the environment you know then you know if you don't go along with their ideas and you don't love the environment and your your hater and you know if this isn't bizarre enough we even have seminary students we're talking about religious people in religious seminaries in America in New York confessing sins to plants now this is insanity now let's just stop for a moment because we're talking about we're talking about strength to give bring forth birth and brother madam said now we're here in this last day in this a prophecy and there's a prophecy he says we don't weep for me but wait for your children because we're coming into a day an hour where things are vastly changing and so you know again the idea of putting animals - with equal rights to man or giving them rights period are you with me it comes from the spirit of insanity that's in this world the sorts of Rights comes from God himself he's the one who gives rights and he gave man his capacity for rational thought because he was man was made in the image of God but to give rights to creatures that are in irrational lacking a moral sense and incapable of living in a rights-based environment makes a mockery of the very concepts of rights and ultimately threatens man himself and now to show you the spirit that is behind this the the man Peter Singer who is widely viewed as the father of international animal rights movement singer publicly stated that parents should have the right to euthanize their children within 28 days of birth who have severe handicaps and in fact killing an effective infant is not more is not morally equivalent to killing the person he's written sometimes is not wrong at all but but apparently apparently though killing an animal is you see let me just care it carry this down what were your on this subject to say we should not eat animals is to challenge God himself and to and the question God's own goodness for he said in Genesis 9:3 every moving thing that's the liveth shall be meat for you even as ever greener have I given you all things so then sew them to question or to say we should not eat animals is to challenge God and challenge his own goodness as he would say and carried it further him to first Timothy four and one and that he said and the spirit speaks expressly in the latter times some shall depart from faith from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and the doctrines of devils notice what Paul calls these seducing spirits and doctrines of devils you know what's because they're being taught in our schools they've been taught by our educators and he says he brings it the speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron forbidding to marry commanding to abstain from meats which God created to be received with Thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth for every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with Thanksgiving for it is sanctified or made holy by the Word of God in prayer a man now courts we're against animal cruelty and God is against it but to elevate animals to human rights removes man from his position of sonship and makes animals equal to him so here we get it you know fur babies and pet kids and pet brands instead of raising children for God it's a part of the prophecy of the last day now jesus said if they did this to me where they beat and strife and crucify when I have done nothing wrong what will happen the last day when human life will be devalued now brother Brennan would give the illustration of this and he said you know the time will come he said where that where they won't want to have children and raise a children for the to glorify God and and and to be in position you the family is under attack the structure of the home is under attack motherhood has been under attack hey man and then of course fatherhood is under attack marriage itself is under attack somebody help me preach now the whole thing that every every everything of the Word of God season is coming against it in every way that he can and you're gonna be the one talking rationale you're the one that's going to be thought yeah you know hard-headed and stupid and man and worthy of jail time and sent to prison and whatever else because you go against the trends of society and brother Bantam gave the illustration he says I'm a mother bear that doesn't conceived during the winter and said she'll hunt up last year's Cubs and mothered him and she has to mother something remember that this is this is why other all the need for the pet brands and and even let me just say even though the deal of the feminist spirits getting their up on the homosexual community and then they'll get into livestock raising and little baby goats or lambs or calves or this or that the other and they're flooding the whole the whole livestock in industry and all the pet industry because they're got a mother something are you with me a man but but again again what about the church and brother Madden said if a woman won't have a baby for a husband she'll take a cat or a dog or something she's got a mutters something it's a nature but to bear a child for a husband and raise it to the service of God that's entirely out of her line she should all not she'd be so disgraced if she did buy her sin loving society of this 1965 type of women what about right here in 2019 nearly over fifty years later are you wouldn't me but then he equates and he said a true picture on the modern church today neither does a modern church here won any screaming shouting tongue speaketh to 38 young and surrounder yeah yet she don't want me to them whooping and crying and screaming hey ma'am hallelujah what such a child would immediately throw her out of her denomination they had one like that and her churches rather tore out right quick why are you letting such stuff as that goal so you see she's preg needed with something because he's bringing board members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbered suits are eight miserable creatures that she thinks they are it was certainly embarrassing it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific society church that she belonged to here they would throw her out at the next council she came havin so she don't want to be printed with the word is anybody listening because that's the only kind that the word can't bring forth now we talked about warning the word the word the word the word but the only time the word can bring forth a man is not gonna be pet babies come over you have to pediment baby in the church and they're backslidden all the time they never have deliverance in their life are you with me look what God wants his genuine forlorn sons and daughters of God that are in his image and in his likeness Amen the only kind of work can bring forth is those whose got a spark in them they must come to light and what I'm asking today is the church is the bride Church is the message search do they have the strength to bring four children at the word those Pentecostal babies acts 2:38 the only time that the word can bring forth those kind of when they come and have born they're born with a life in them it's not a stillbirth it's not a dead baby it's not a quiet baby come on it's a baby that screaming yelling hollering man rich I see because light the brass has entered into my porn of the spirit it has the Spirit of God in it he said no and Alexa Church John three gone bobbed hair painted face there's no such of that they just added all of it you don't find that in the Word of God amen now he tells what you find in the Word of God you find an old-fashioned sanctified Holy Ghost filled child born of the Spirit of God screaming and hollering and shouted and praising God but that's altogether out of the reaches for her she don't want none of that Oh what does she do then she brings forth a pair of painted face short wearing Jezebel society illegitimate cats they call him or she was born and married connected with her she was married connected with her first husband the first Adam by the adulterous wife of Eve Adams first wife you say adulteress she sure was but no she claims it atom this atom this first atom is dead so he died a long time ago and I'm reborn again I'm certainly married to the second Adam Christ the word but he said notice what she loves now you want to know if she really married him walk the Sheila what's her lover and you can see what she loved in love with the church says this dar the word says this but she says my church says this then who she is in love with who is her husband her own fruits prove who she is she was born first to Adam that's her natural birth she never left that she's a lover of the world and she claims he's born the second time to Christ but her lover notices to Adam yet because she loves the world and another thing noticed what kind of children she is bearing it tells what their Papa is whether it's the first item or the second I'm a man if the church belongs that brings for the child of the second Adam amen he acts the second Adams way of acting like they did on the day of Pentecost that is a really true second adam's children how many can say Amanda that this morning I mean that's what God is asking the church do we have strength to bring out of this word that has been given the seals have been taken off of it the mysteries have been revealed hallelujah the seven thunders have other divorces amen God has spoke to this generation but now do we have strength to bring forth custom reinforce it's got to be something with life finished a man now brother Branham would tell us in marriage and divorce now some of these things are a little difficult for a lot of modernist to swallow but it's still our message but he talked about in in marriage and divorce speaking about Christ said he can put the church away but she cannot put him away he did it and he's true that in the days of the Luther Wessling Pentecost when they refused to become further part of him by having a spiritual sexual affair to become pregnant with further part of the word you understand she refused that Lutheran Church refused for Christ to have any more desire with her Luther refused and let me say she's gonna call me something anyhow so it is today with that but one of them they failed to take that word that refused Christ and any woman that refuses a man his child has no right to be a wife to him they might remember in the Bible and the King married Esther because the Queen reviews he just got another one what happened when she refused to come out with the King and obey him the same thing it is when a woman refuses to be wiped her husband and so it with the church that refuses to become fragmented in the age that we now live to bring forth children of this age we are not loosened and we're not wet sleeves and neither are we Pentecostal we've got to be children of this age through the pregnancy of the Word of God to bring forth the child of this age the seed child I hope you understand a man now he goes on and he said but he said now notice said the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word unadulterated not touched by any man's organization or any man-made tearing she'll be purely on adulterated bride of the word a man and a man I hope you get that not on the air and I'm saying this morning even out on their hair I'm hope you get that and then there's gonna be a bride in this last day that has the strength to bring for the child with life a night now saying this I'm afraid that we have over emphasized the letter and under emphasized the spirit too much stress he said on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamics let me just go over some things about the gospel and what the gospel is and the Great Commission that has been given brother Branham would would emphasize this many times and so I've just picked out of you and I think brother Timothy may have read one of these maybe there's some of these winds tonight was a great message brother Timothy god bless you for that but he said that he said here Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every nation now listen see whether that's right or not preach the gospel to every nation that's the United States and to all the world he that believeth is baptized whom he saved he that believeth not so be damned these signs shall follow them that believe and in my name they will cast out Devils speak with new tongues take up serpents drink deadly things or lay their hands on the sick and shall not harm them now he didn't say go teach the word he said go preach the gospel and he said the word is the beginning or the forerunner of the gospel you read that one and the word goes out and the gospel of and the power of the demonstration of God follows the word and makes the word manifest that's the gospel right amen now the Bible said that that God went with them confirming the word with signs following them a ma'am so the word went forth and God confirmed it and now I've got ed to me this is on shouting ground to you if this if the word is a forerunner of the gospel and we today have received the word again hallelujah then Gorda God if the word is a forerunner the gospel then the power the demonstration of God follows the word hallelujah Amen no wonder we say we shall see miracles and while with no wonder we can stress and know that our God will be a God that is among us healing the sick delivered his people moving in his church the Copa word has went forth as the forerunner for the signs to follow a man now he would also go on to say and then this is another one Christ never told us to build in his seminary or anything like that he said preach the gospel and the gospel isn't word only but through power manifestation of the Holy Spirit which would produce the science of mark 16 when he said go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature these signs shall follow them the word itself is dead until it becomes in an action and produces life are you with me now the word itself is dead until it comes into action and produces life man you say well we got the word the word the word and I'm telling the lot of you dead churches out there it's just a dead word it's a word without life until it becomes God breathed and when it becomes God breathed moved on by the spirit it heals it delivers it set free [Applause] there's a lot of word that's laying there lifeless hey man oh my and but but listen it's just and listen here's what your brothers said it's just waiting for someone with faith to an order that make it live again somebody with me now am i waiting for you to anoint it with faith man because it takes a faith to spot that word to make it live hey man now so it's because there's an outfit atmosphere that brings forth the product now so again he would talk about it again let me just share a couple of these more but he says in the missionary talk he said the word gospel means good news the good news is a Bible and the Bible is the letter and the letter killeth and the spirit giveth life so Paul said the gospel came not through word only brother Branham said it we're putting too much stress on the mechanics and nuts and on the dynamics in mind now I'll tell you right now the moment you start talking like that then you get somebody trying to tell you you're gonna be an old Mother Hubbard you're just gonna be another Pentecostal you're you're gonna hear you're gonna be something something like that you know you know that that ain't what we do today where we're hearing the word age and what you got in your word ages you got a letter that is killing you hey man but let me tell you something friend good it wasn't sick to kill you it was the gasoline that only needs to fire the Holy Ghost to come upon that word I prove that what you really got is gasoline because otherwise it won't be water now so he said the only way the gospel could be priests would be to manifest the power of the Holy Spirit now he said then strictly speaking when he said the science must follow them may not the sign may follow them they ought to follow them they shall follow them therefore strictly speaking a man cannot qualify himself as a believer until this has happened no church can have the right are calling themselves a believe in church until these signs have followed them a man and what to do and it's making the word manifest now again in what is the Holy Ghost she said he said he said go into all the world and preach the gospel what does the gospel not word only but through the power and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost making the Word of God manifest is the gospel so now again you know the denominations brother Brennan said couldn't take the gospel and finish the Great Commission because he said they couldn't receive all the word amen and so now again if we're gonna finish the Great Commission we received the word and then to preach the gospel here is to make the Word of God manifested a man to see the word demonstrated in his power a man now again in five identification he says Paul said the gospel came not to us in word only but through power manifestation of the Holy Ghost the gospel is the power of God to make the word act what it says it'll new preach the gospel into all the world so the gospel is the power of God to make the word act so if the power of God to make the word act isn't in the body of believers they're not believers they're only professor believers they have a profession without a possession a man they're bringing forth stillborn babies instead of babies with life in them they don't have strength to bring forth to what kind of word said that they would produce now again what is the gospel not just word on impulse it but manifestation the word the gospel came didn't live until word only but through power and demonstration go on all the world and demonstrate the power of the Resurrection see these signs shall follow them that believe just cheat see the word won't do it you've got out of the power of the Holy Ghost behind the word to make it come to life again amen there again if he says it takes more than just teaching a word it takes a manifestation of that word to make these signs follow that's right God manifested himself oh my there again he would say otherwise the only way the signs of March 16 can follow the believer is that the Holy Spirit Himself takes the Word of God and demonstration to the people now faith makes that word live and then again in Christ the mystery a great sermon that everybody said listened to and if a man says he's born again and he tries to place these promises of Christ in this last day to some other age making him Christ yesterday but not today then that man or that person it's been an a delusion by Satan and if a man says that he believes that and it doesn't manifest through him Jesus said mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe into all the world to every age cast out devils speaking with tongues all these great manifestation of gifts that would follow that they shall not they may be they all do they will and heavens and earth will pass away but his word walked hallelujah a man he come right along in his horizon of the Sun what was just reading about the dynamics he said that gospel came not in the word only but through power in manifestation of the Holy Spirit to prove that he is alive amen he said below I'm so glad there is a 10000 octane power is the word of God and man I tell you it's already been demonstrated to power this word man it can create it can heal it can save a man they can speak storms out of you out of existence somebody help me preach a man if there is power that lays in this word a 10019 power the Word of God oh did you get it and the Holy Ghost to light it up it's not just enough to have the quotes it's not just enough to read Bible verses it's not just enough to teach the Bible and teach the message it's gotta be priest that means is gonna be manifested that demonstrated oh yeah he said look there's a 10,000 octane power the world of God the holy gifts to lighted up and resurrect the power cord into men's life a woman's life into a church that said that Cadillac down the road under that dynamic power of the Holy Ghost which came back and was waved again the day of Pentecost making him the same yesterday today and forever but the thing of this is and God helped me here but wouldn't brother Branham left us he left us a car that had both mechanics and dynamics but somebody turned it off and took away the key and said only William Branham could drive a car and the car in gonna move no Lord until he comes back well I Got News for You he ain't coming back until the resurrection and after the resurrection you know after we've changed we won't need to buy in healing we won't need a rapture will be in the rapture we won't need any of the great things that we got a drive to amen don't put me back to horse and buggy don't take put me back to an oxcart don't put me back to horseback or walking a man I'm right here and as a mother we we have got a car that can drive it can run right down the road to divine healing it can break and pick up all your children along the way is bringing them to [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] that's the thing I battled with preachers for years I was told you can't even sing only believe because that was his theme song well my question is why can't it be the bride's theme song why can't we be ones who believe hey man I was I was told that Kate lay hands on the sick that was a brother branham's job no he don't tell me I wasn't I was there hey man I know what I'm talking about and the moment that these are dead heads see someone in the driver's seat they immediately want to send out a warning saying don't try to be brother branham there's only one turn age oh yeah I know there's but one prophet to this generation and I'm not stupid enough to try to take his place and I know we saw demonstrated the maasai sign and there's only one of them to generation it was shown to Israel in their clothes someday it was shown to the Gentiles in our closing day it was shown - it was to identify to us the word and there will be no one else had that sign the Messianic sign was given to show us the attitude once more time what the same attitude that Jesus has toward the sick a man took toward the lost towards mercy it was to vindicate that the word has come and to demonstrate the power that lies within the word and then we don't have the maasai sign but we do have the Messiah a man and and brother Bannerman saying God gave us the Messiah his promised word for this day and it's just waiting for somebody with faith to ignore it and they can live again I'm going to say we got the message we got the word we got the Bible it's unsealed it's unveiled oh it's a real Messiah the Word of God which Jesus said both heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away but the church sits spiritually dead the hour has passed them they're in a slump and hardly know what to do one run in this way and the other that way and here every promise that God made in the Bible every one of them is layin there just as good as it ever was it's the hour what makes the church like this we're in the age of Laodicea when when she has to come this way this is an hour for it so agree we can't be William Branham we will and just let me let me just say it like you know let me let me mean it like this you know let me get it like this I don't think we should try to be him I don't think we should impersonate him and we're not gonna add them aside sign but the Messiah's here amen the anointed word and because he is here there will be prophecies there will be word of knowledge there will be word of wisdom there will be discerning the spirits and then there will be divers high type of tongues and interpretation of tongues it will be workings of miracles and there will be gifts of healing and there will be somebody with faith to avoid it to make it live again that be a people who can't believe and those and there also will be those with green-eyed jealousy who want to crucify the workings of the Holy Ghost amen I'll tell you right now I just stop and pause and this ain't gonna work well in the face of some but I'm praying God helped me to be a big man he's in what in the world by the Tim you're supposed to be humble you're right I'm supposed to be a humble I'm to Humble down to God's Word but I'm not to Humble down to man's ideas [Applause] here's what a big man is this is what I'm praying God helped me to be a big man Jesus with his head back walking on the priests is screaming at him making fun of others called not a crime how who's that him but did you notice the whole burden of all the world rested on him Calvary the dark hours and guests simony laid before him in only as he went he never noticed their scoffing and you know when someone says something evil about you and you want to take it up and get anger about it that shows you hadn't went quite deep enough yet with God big men don't do those things that's what made him God to me he was big he didn't have to notice their little scoffing he had a purpose he had a work to do and that was fulfill what God had sent him to do and he was determined to do it and he didn't care what anyone else said and I say this with respect to all I have I've been offered a great position in churches if I'd forget about divine healing and a good salary and a fine home but God sent me to pray for sick children it don't make any difference what anyone else says I have a commission to do and they can say Holy Roller or there whatever they wish I've got a commission to do and you've got a commission to do and everyone that's born of the Spirit of God has a commission to do it don't make any difference what the world says and you don't have to notice their scoffing and I'm just saying God helped me to be a bigger man a man that what I am so big till I don't care about the skull fee that I got reminder one thing and that's the message and that message is that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah and I don't care how much were made fun of and call old Mother Hubbard because we have a church that is given birth to 238 Bible screaming yelling children that are live of the power glove I don't care what kind of name that will attack on us I want to be big enough don't notice anybody feel how many feels that way the women oh but the reason you don't see things happening in the church is cause they cling to believe in the blood but they reject a very plan to get into the blood the word a man now listen we got the word sons are going to follow the word a man now so you see me says no wonder they can't believe in miracles no wonder no wonder they condemn it and the same reason they condemned it back there is the same reason they condemn it today they're guilty as it can guilty can be because only under the shed blood and those who would dare would you dare drive that car would you dare use that same key and turn it on like the Prophet did would you dare would you dare oh just sit there bill attendant you know your kid you're just to pretend you just couldn't pretend that this thing will run you're just to pretend that we're to have divine healing where you you're just adapt it to just pretend just pretend it to church has power we and do we got the word look look here at the car and let's polish it a little bit more today and let's put some Simon eyes on it you know where where it got scratched up a little by somebody you know I you know cuz it got used anybody knows you got a canoe car it's gonna get scratched it gets used card that don't ever get a scratch he never got out of the garage hey man oh yeah it's gonna get scratched it's gonna have what people call blemish circum people people make fun of it all kinds of things are you with me remember I tell you it was in Maine the church isn't made to be a showcase we are not a museum where the Holy Spirit used to move we're not a museum you know when we have articles it and a faction and the in pieces lying on my walls of what God used to do we're not a museum and we are living breathing panting church the bride of Jesus Christ a man who was sent to finish a commission and that mission is preach demonstrate that gospel demonstrated in our lives demonstrate that he still reigns over sin he still reigns over disease he still reigns over affliction but that's we'll drive I say don't put on the brakes Santa Maria [Applause] but it's the hour of crucifixion just as well as there are the women you know that I haven't they're their pet babies and the pit grounds and the pet deaths and and they won't bring four children and there's a church that won't bring four children hey man but also right here in this last name look at the trouble that we're yeah a day of blasphemy even God's against that Oh even the Lord's against it so not sure if Santa the Lord Jehovah is against you Hezekiah look here i'm to quote over here against you i found listen in the face of your quote i can find five thousand the other way let's balance it out and then you pray you said well we got church order we need church order I believe in tripped order but I think sometimes people need to have a get out of trips order long enough to get saved you Church holder God right out of the church until it becomes a dead morgue well we think so long now you can only preach so long now if you preach longer than that well I've done broke your mood and I'm not ashamed and I'm gonna tell you I'm not gonna get a complex about it I got Commission I've got a job to do man honestly was saying a lot of you if you had something to preach my preach a little longer because you have some sentences and there was a power of God that was gone with it the audience was still with you and the Spirit of God was still moving a man who's loved as a Holy Ghost is fallen we ought to preach [Applause] there's a man come up to me one day with a quote because I preached a little long in a meeting he brought me a quote I thought I'd like you like to see what the Prophet said he said you know sermons should be about 45 minutes I said yeah I said you read the other one where he said well if it's just all believers you could preach all night so I said next service I'll just dismiss all you unbelievers and our priests Homer I understand I understand understand I understand we can sit through three hours of a ballgame I understand I understand we can sit for hours at a movie but I understand the gospel hasn't lost its attraction I think brother on Spencer's church here the other day you know and there was so many that come to the Wayne Lawson I and let's see who - who else did we have somebody help me yeah brother Donnie my goodness how that forget him so we had that we had the me and brother Donnie and brother going lost and preaching that the the meetings and man the place was packed out I mean there was just it wasn't even standing room only they were they were around the walls up and up and every little crack and coroner everywhere I looked out and I said huh this looks like a Branham meeting to me where people are eager to come to church amen Gary stank he says to me all the time he drives up 70 something year old man he'll drive up for Manny in here two hours and he'll say a church alive was worth the drive a lot of you feel the same way sister grace tackies from Mississippi drove over this morning because the church alive was worth the drive a man that's way there it ought to be a man a church where the power of God is moving are you with me and he's heading those who would dare some little brother who dares under humility to take God at His Word and walk out there and confess his sins and forget all these dogmas and days and stand there under the blood and believe it then they want to call him a fanatic oh they have crucified the effects of the word I got a bunch of scripture on that I might quote two or three of them they crucify said how do you rather than they crucified the word when Jesus Christ said he's the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8 they say in such a way he is and Jesus said his last commandment go into all the world mark 16 preach the gospel these signs have followed them to believe all the world and every creature and half of it ain't reached and there's millions dying every year that never heard the name of Jesus so it's still the same general still that General Orders it's still a commandment of God all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs have followed them that believe are you with me Amen sit still the general orders and he said but they say that was for that generation and and they made the commandment of God of none effect to this and they crucified the effect you see the crucifixion today is not trying to kill the man Jesus but to kill the effect of the gospel oh wow it's true but oh yeah it worked back there but watch out now I'm real you know brother Jim you're not supposed to drive this car I'm not well who is some of you is let it set dead for over 50 years and ain't went nowhere you ain't even got a tire mark to prove you moved an inch I'm not trying to be smart I mean god help me I'm trying to be big I'm trying to say I've got a commission and we've got a commission and what we're asking this morning is there is a church is there people is there bride somewhere that has the strength to bring forth in the face of all the opposition now is there strength to stand and let me just tell you we're we're commanded to stand can I take just a few more minutes all right let's go to Joshua one and three and let me tell you where we have been commanded to stand the position in other words we have been commanded to take now I am fully convinced that all one man's scriptures have been fulfilled and I'm not in any way trying to say I'm the only driver I'm saying that you've got the car to drive your car down to healing down to deliverance hey Matt but now we have been commanded to stand somewhere look at Joshua 1 in 3 every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that I have given to you as I said unto Moses so now here's his he said I've given you this land I want you to go take possession of it man I'll tell you we were left a car that would run I say let's go take possession of it and as I was with Moses brother branham would explain this because you know immediately someone said out brother to him don't go trying to be the Joshua well in this case you want to be the Joshua you understand where Joshua's to it are you with me because he said it was then again Josh would the new commander to lead an army the second place the second to the place were a great like Moses stood it was no little task and I think of a minister today that's called a God to step into the tracks what Jesus stood what a command what a commission but each that's called of God is commissioned to stand in that same place I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world each Minister is called to stand where he would the works that I do say you do also its ministers ordained of God and is commanded to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform those duties that Jesus performed that quite a command Amen so don't tell me don't tell me John 14:12 is not for me oh yeah oh yeah although I do have a book in my library that was put out by message preacher many many years ago they said John 14:12 is only for brother branham night collects dust in my office and it's a relic that are I never reference because I know better I left that book far behind a man because John 14:12 says the works that I do shall you do also and greater works than these how you do because I go unto my father are you with me oh man so Jesus made it personal to ever individual and that's why brother Branham would make it personal to ever individual a man so but every minister every minister is ordained of God commanded to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus performed that's quite a command he said we also find Joshua knowing his commission knowing it laid his hand God had called him for duty then he must not fail he walked softly before God and when he called the people together and told him that God had Commission and what's the costs of the people they said we'll follow you as we did Moses if we can see the same thing that followed Moses following you only be strong and courageous and that ought to be the requirement of ever born again person today if we're requested to follow then let's see the signs follow the believers as Jesus said the things that I do say you do also notice every believer somebody women now every believer is to stand in those steps and he said every one of must do they said to Joshua if you if we seek God is with you as he was with Moses now Joshua didn't do the same science as Moses he didn't use the rod like Moses he didn't call frogs like Moses he didn't imitate Moses he just did what he was called to do are you with me and he said if we're requested to follow then let's see the signs follow the believer you're asking you're asking for others to follow well let's just let's see the signs of a Christian let's see the holiness of God let's see the honesty let's see the purity let's see the righteousness you want others to follow you you know you want your children to follow in your footsteps and then let's see that same thing that was in Jesus living in you then you'll be alive worthy of following are you with me not just went ahead to take this command and then the people said go let God be with you as he was with Moses and we all know that the same spirit that led us thus far can take his own oh how the church ought to look this morning to find the spirit working among the people if you want to church home where the spirit that raised Christ from that they had the Holy Spirit that I move among the people that's that's the spirit that's raised God's raisin up in the last day to take a people over into the other land into the full promise of all the blessings of God and did a book a mission that he gave and the promise the promise is unto you and do your children a man some brother renders any of you if you want a church home where the sphere of God and that's what I think we want a man we want a church home or preachers are anointed they don't just get up and read you and do your little sermon but our mountain there's a fire shut up in their bones you know somebody said to me this week's and and I don't mean to get into it was just something negative here on this at all but somebody said something me this week said you know said Tim there are those it said of you it's just your ego what you wanted this big church I said my ego I was my my goodness I I was happy where I was if God hadn't given me a divine command to go and do something and then God was with me every step of the way until this building is totally debt-free with miracle after miracle after miracle and it was my ego as to what they call ego is God's zeal a man they're mistaken what it is it's not an ego it's God zeal I said because I was jealous for his people because I wanted God's people to be able to gather together in our foul meetings see the sphere of God move and as faster others were invited to come because we had a vision besides us for and no more amen because I was going to make sure it wasn't just a family church but it was a family of God Church and it would be run by the Holy Ghost I say this melody go it's the seal it's the sea God and God put a righteous seal in every believer there oughta be a seal to get to the house of God there will be a seal to read your Bible to hear the word of God preached hallelujah you are people of zeal that's why you see their service after service and you can sit on the edge of your seat and you're not playing around with your phone or you're not to communicate in something else and working somewhere else doing something else in your mind you're right here in the service pulling on the gift of God because your people that's Jesus heal the sick raise the dead [Applause] my brother branham would say Joshua in all is knowing that the command was great but having the assurance that he could be fearless he could be and we call it reckless well I've always been kind of reckless when I was out in the middle of the country and you know where it was where the GPS couldn't find us and I had a little church there in the back way in the backwoods people around here Wonderworld all these people come from we built this building that was filled up Hey where in the world well we'd been out in the country started there in 1972 and all the old abandoned building you know baptist preacher come there for a funeral and I opened it up by that time we had we were running water in a toilet there's some people thought we were unspiritual for heaven if adolescent discovers you wouldn't even have a toilet and baptist preacher come in looked around he said son he was there to preach a funeral I was there to open up the building for for the convenience of the of the people of the mourners that come he come looked around he said son I sure AM a sure admire your courage come look at him I said courage what in the world are you talking about courage he said the courage to come out here in the sticks like this and start a church that's courage you see it don't fit but I knew if I would preach the word people will come now people got that the opposite they think if you preach the word won't nobody be there but I Got News for you but I was fearless and brother branham's and I was reckless I'll be honest with you I was reckless I didn't know any better I didn't know you were supposed to go and scout out how many people lives in this place and you know and then decide if that would support a church or not and you do all of the math and and figured out and you know for all the people that because they won't drive more than 15 minutes or else he'll go to the next church he's closer that's America that's America hey man so I didn't know to do all that so I was reckless I was fearless I didn't have no fear I just did what God called me to do that chips follower than me some people say well brother Tim you know you how long you been a pastor well I said you know the reason I'm a pastor I preached in one place for too long some people came but you have to be you have to be realized your commission you got a job to do you got something that you're called to do and you got to be courageous and fearless and willing to take the SKA theme because others are not going to understand your vision and others don't understand my vision of a bride with power others don't understand my vision of a place where Devils are cast out that they're not just coddled and allowed to sit on the pig on the Pew and feel our young people and possess their lives and pull them away in the sand but we can have a the power of God that will cast Satan out [Applause] hallelujah hey man and you don't understand my seal my seal is to see young people barred Amen ago people born I'm an adult so just taking Jesus as their Savior to come out a little further and be filled with the Holy Ghost and be born of the breath of God a man that may be a little reckless and may take courage but friend I know it's a reason because I got a commission and my commission is that God's Word won't fail and it's gonna have a bride and she will be without spot or wrinkle and that there will be a bride that will be as she was at Pentecost that will welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ I want to know is there straight is it somewhere or there others around the world today this here yes I have found the strength to make one more push to move with your spirit one more time Oh breathe breath of God fill the house with your presence fill the church young people people put a seal in them take out the slothy laodicea out of their lives that replace it with it Ginuwine Xia but seal double repent but feel that a humble down to the word seal clapping leaving so can the Church of the Living God be reckless and fearless in faith if we're pointing the right way and I'll tell you friends I don't care how you counted you may have your favorite quote but I'll tell you I've got word after word of a thousand teen power in its word so that could be reason in the party salvation and the few ultra power sinners with the way to Calvary where demons are cast out and the people of God walking at freedom unfruitful let's stand our feet and give Him praise [Applause] so be with you he will not fail us he will be with us hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise him one more time will you give him honor give him glory right now it's a good land there be no baron or an unfruitful nothing like a seryung hallelujah hallelujah there is to me their history to bring forth hallelujah Jesus we love you Lord thank you Jesus real softly now oh I want to see him look on his face just worship him a moment oh I want to see [Music] [Music] foreign and all the street [Music] always Cheers Oh just hop it right now oh I want to see him we come to church that's what we want we want to see him we want to see him working in the church moving by spirit we want the power of God unto salvation the Holy Spirit moving working in the body we want to see his miracles at work in the church [Music] we want to see the same signs of Jesus Christ we want to be big people big people we don't notice a scuffle we just look at the promise oh yeah I know the mechanics without the dynamics is no good neither is dynamics without the mechanics as all sermons that we could preach it takes two wings to fly it takes spirit and it takes truth truth alone won't do it spirit alone look good for the car it's got to have the mechanics thank God for the word but it's also has to have the dynamics brother branham's would say you could scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny the word it won't do any good you just cranking the Pistons you got to spark there to fire but no gasoline to fire by it only work as they come together we want to be a balanced Church we don't go off to the right or to the left we just want to walk with Jesus we want to see him in our lives see move maybe today is we just bow our heads just for a moment let me just talk to you just a second we're in this church you didn't understand everything I said maybe you couldn't brother Tim and really things that you talked about I I don't quite see that way I don't quite understand I I'm trying to get a little picture of it but there's one thing I really want I really want to see Jesus I really want to see Jesus you seem to know him his life that's what you gotta knows him if you would like to know live not Church not a good preacher not just a noisy box for this a lot of freedom people get attracted to that some of them are like you know get attracted don't understand what it's all about but if I can get you to get in love with Jesus thank you just get you to love him with all your heart with all your soul with all this within you won't you just look at your life today and compare it there's a sign of a Christian follow you maybe your mom or dad and you want your children to follow you in righteousness but no can they follow your life is the works that Jesus done being done in you is this love being manifested this faith is the fruits and won't you ask him today what did you ask you Lord really I want to see you I want you to be the Lord of my life would you'd be the ruler over everything want you to be in my life she'd be in my heart do you take sin and darkness from me and put in there a real faith to believe every promise Lord if I have to start making baby steps toward you I'll I'll do whatever if I have to run I'll run whatever I do I'm doing it but but I don't want to have a seal I want to have a seal to do right if their heads are bowed in your thoughts of the Lord just a moment maybe you might just want to put a hand up toward God and say Lord come by my way today be real to me Lord I know a little bit about the word but I want that dynamic power of the Holy Ghost gonna changed my life don't be the same person I was when I come here I won't be new I'm God to forgive me of all my sins watch me make me pure cleanse me he sees you he sees your hand going out to him now you just keep that in faith right now and so we believe got together though Jesus is a step towards righteousness Nord it's a confession under salvation you said except we be born of the water in the spirit and we must be first must have that word portion of our birth where our faith is based on the word and what you said and I pray O God today that you'll take every sin of theirs and forgive them and remove it as far as the East is from the West put in the sea of your forgetfulness that is no more remembered against them anymore I would pray Lord that also that you do such a work in your children and in these lives that you to lead the moon to where they're not just get the water part when they have the word but the Spirit of God brings an awakening and a realization then a spark in their life of real life or they scream out they scream out that they love you with all their heart their whole life demonstrates it to a world the thing that we can see Jesus I pray Lord that you'll do it in Jesus name a man [Music] Oh holy spirit' [Music] [Music]
