but you always been there you're truly the God that deserves worship and praise we ask Lord your blessings today upon us as we look into the word and we look into the xix of God knowing that nineteen will break the yoke it'll take the unbelief of our lives as we ministered Wednesday night Lord our chief purpose ISM as a church is to cast seek now that's what salvation is no word is preached the devil is moved back and the hearts are convicted and able to believe and they come to you Lord oh god I prayed that today that we'll just move in a temple that were you can work in our lives and hearts bring healing and deliverance in the mighty name of Jesus Lord and do you know those that are in need no God those that are even out on the Internet or they would be listening in to the service today father I pray that you minister to them some of them are homebound and maybe can't come to church but Lord you know their need we just ask God that you'll supply the cordilla riches and glory and I asked Lord today that our offering of sacrifice would be acceptable in your sight as we offer it with the blood of Jesus because we know only through that blood is it is accepted in Jesus name Amen it may God bless you amen good to see each one of you here this mornin we just want to look right into the Word of God I hope you enjoyed worshiping the Lord that's what it's all about is giving him the praise and the glory and the honor we're going to look at Luke chapter 24 and verse 49 and then go back to Acts chapter 1 and verse 6 for our scripture reading this morning Luke chapter 24 and verse 49 and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but are ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high and then over here in Acts chapter 1 and verse 6 and when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord without at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times of the seasons which the father have put in his own power but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth and here we are amen god bless you as you are seated in man I would get you to continue remembering those that will be traveling this week brother Timothy and brother Tim winners will be returning from the beans to Japan connect in there with a brother Cragin and brother George winters and they'll be all flying home on Tuesdays should arrive here sometimes Tuesday so just keep them in prayer the Lord's done some wonderful things there and we thank God for that amen for His mercies baptisms were taking place I think in brother Timothy's meetings at the the youth gathering in in the Philippines they baptized 30 in the wonderful name of Jesus amen we thank God for that then you know some of the one of the Japanese young young sisters got to go over to the Philippines and take part of those meetings and it was really life-changing for her and so you know where you can see other young people for 500 gathered there and and just all just dedicated to serve the Lord and got moving in a tremendous tremendous way a man in those meetings and then of course in the other works it's altogether different yet it's the same God but on a different application of gifts when you're speaking to new believers and and trying to establish works but I understand there was a whole lot of things that have been accomplished by their journey there and they ministered with the the church group of 25 30 people there and on the first weekend by the Timothy ministered along with brother Craig and then flew out to the Philippines while they remain behind and went down into other parts of Japan and witnessed baptized and and it's just wonderful to see Seoul sate and then people wonder sometim well you know is is is there still grace well I'll tell you there is still grace amen because God is still reaching out to Souls and bringing deliverance and so we're just continue looking to that and you know that we are continuing the translation works so there's quite a bit of being works that are being translated we're we're just finishing up the seven seals in the Japanese language getting them on the hub and and the many other sermons that are getting up there now so you know we we want to get the message in their hands right God's doing some wonderful things in our age and time and we want to be a true witness of that we know what it did for us and how it changed our lives and how it opened up our understanding and brought us to know and love Jesus more so you know we want to get the message in them in a way that they can understand it and be blessed by it so we are we're diligently just last night I paid for the translations of the of the sixth seal and getting it up on there on the hub and so we're just finishing up question answers and then the Seventh Seal and the whole seal book will be done plus we got a lot of other sermons that are now maybe twenty twenty-five sermons on the hub already that the Lord has helped us to do to get them in the Japanese language we'll be starting on the next I laid out five the next ones for them to go through that I picked out in 1965 sermons for them to start now to translate and as busy as they have been they'll get them right away and every time that we get one on the hub it just makes it work anybody in all the world that speaks Japanese nobody you don't have to be in Japan you can be in Alaska you can be in South America you can be in Africa but if you speak or use the Japanese language you can access it on the hub and of course the English is there and much of the French and Spanish and different other languages that are daran and so if you even you if you want to go listen to it the sermons and brother branham the message hub just just get on there and and have a gastronomical jubilee amen I think we ought to be listening to the message I believe it'll bless our hearts and change our lives and transform us amen we know what it did for us so I encourage it to do for others I I know myself I've been transformed not only by the Holy Spirit but by the Word of God as we have grown in the Word of God so you don't feed your experience on God's Word hey man it's all available to you it's at your fingertips it's a lot better than you know going to somewhere like that than some of these other sites that are out there you know put your put your time into the right time now this morning we're going to be speaking on connected by the book and we're speaking about the people of the book and as we just continue to stop the people of the book that we have been ministered of home but this morning this little sermon here we're going to be speaking about being connected by the book because the Word of God connects us to God amen you might have seen in the recent news where Israel's ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon addressed the the United Nations and he held up a copy of the Bible for all the ambassadors present to see and he says this is our deed to our land and he said God gave the land to the people of Israel and Genesis when he made a covenant with Abraham and he stressed to all the world that the Bible is what gives them the deed to the land and even so God has given us the deed to the land of promise the holy ghost that's our promised land and and so we we open our scripture this morning with the question that has been asked by the disciples Lord now at this time this is 2,000 years ago now at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and jesus answered it is not for you to know that times of the season which the father had put in his own power now that was 2000 years ago as we said and now seven church ages ago and it was not for them to know the times nor the seasons of the restoration of Israel but we are in the hour when it is time to restore the kingdom and I'm not so type and our counterpart Israel is a nation who has been now restored back to their homeland we can actually actually begin to see some of the fulfillment of the scripture even the question that they were asking Lord will you at this time and know we can say no it's this day it's not 2000 years ago but no it's this day that you will restore the kingdom back to Israel again and Israel now being a sovereign nation over their land and restored to their homeland now if they are our type the natural seed of Abraham and we are the spiritual that can we see that it's also restoration time and that it is a season for all of Israel but the natural and by the seed and the royal seed for the kingdom to be restored a man and for a people to return back to their homeland can I say addy return back to the Holy Ghost amen to all the power of God and the promises that lay in the Word of God the entire title deed of everything that was promised to a people in the end time it is the season of restoration now you know we we've seen the Israel as a a land that has been barren and forsaken Oh howling wilderness and Desolator acronym and it all came because they rejected their Messiah and we understand all of that but you know today again we also look and we see a church that has come through a similar type of dispersal were that they have have wondered now and the Bible the Bible has come like a howling wilderness and and an unfruitful land and what was promised not coming to pass in the lives of the people the supernatural not being on display and the power of the Holy Ghost not being made known are you with me and man and brother branham talked about this kind of thing and he says you know he himself was one as a restoring prophet and he would look out there and God would show him types and signs and and examples and even out when he was in the wilderness he said I was up in Canada thousands of miles from a hard top road and I was writing and and on through the moonlight at night as I was returning there oh my with my horse and I came up over a great big burn over and he said that you know there was Jesus even would tell the Pharisees and the Sadducees that they formalized such denominations of his day said you're nothing but an open Sepulchre you're just a grave you're just full of dead men bombs this is Jesus description of them and brother men would look at these trees and he said you know it's just like a graveyard and it's a spooky little looking place and he said here come a wind right down coming through and as it hit them they would they would sway in the wind must have been quite a wind for for trees without limbs and without leaves to be the big move but they would move and he said as they moved there it was a mournful sound and he said the trees put him in a mind of somebody's great big spider to stand in there but just as dead as a doornail is that even the Palmer ones eat all the black off of them and the fiery trial says has Emblaze all the spirit away from it and there's nothing left but a big sculpture and then this big just as dead as it can be and he said in when the Russian mighty winds come down from heaven the only thing they can do is grow and carry on and say it ain't so and hardly knowing anything they say the days of miracles are past and just every time that God sends a revival man every time God sends a revival in signs and wonders begin to come up and fall around the people like that they say Oh days of miracles were past what the problem left the cattle were me in Caterpillar Aidan and what the Methodists left the Baptist has eaten what the Baptist's left the Presbyterians Eden and what the Presbyterians left the Pentecostals is eaten and he said why you stripped the tree of everything it's got a man all the power all the joy all the good things that God gave to his church on the day of Pentecost they tore it out and nothing's left but a big church name hey man now you know the Bible said they have a name but they're dead they have a name that they're living man but they're dead he said sir you was once a tree but what about now that's a Pentecostal church - what's the same thing you you took the route of the dead tree what the palmer worm left the caterpillar read the Baptist took all the shouting away from the Methodists and one ate this and one eat this until they stripped the church down till they got them you're sitting there dead as a doornail no spirit no shouting and man no joy no peace no healing no nothing hey Matt now you're gonna have to decide whether if you're one of them old dead trees this morning because the way some of you are responding as the wind is going for that the Holy Spirit you're sitting there you see you see you've got nothing but adjusted cold Church Creed we don't want just a church creed and message theology we want the Holy Spirit to be able to come in our Church in our bein a man move us not the Holy Ghost but he said you know he said God's every time God sends down a big rush of glory down you to sit there and moan and say well I don't believe it it's just psychology or it's this it's that dead from the roots twice dead I'm reading what your prophet said put that by the roots it's a sad-looking day with Joel looked at that and so he said that God said I will restore saith the Lord I'm trying to tell you Church we are in the season on restoration they were asking will it come now Lord when will it be and God has let you know you're in the hour of it URM the day of it when the word has been restored in its power and its glory and all the promise of the Lord I will restore and he says I happened to look that night when that William was blowing and how stiff and starchy and dead it was sitting there moaning and groaning didn't have no leg to bend with it no bark on it to make it flexible and it was just moaning and groaning on account of the when my my dog dr. so-and-so and so-and-so said so-and-so but he said I happened to notice that down underneath there was some undergrowth coming up hallelujah amen some little mooses like that and they are the life in them and when that wind began they hit them they just got to twisting and raining and shouting and have a glorious time he said Lorna Linden let me read you what he said let me tell you brother God's gonna raise up a generation of people but I love all this dead stuff that's going to restore saith the Lord God's gonna raise up people who believes in signs and wonders amen and who's got joy unspeakable and full of glory and when the rest mighty winds come it gives right to it amen and frolics and dances and glorifies God amen hallelujah Greg green leaves are clapping their hands and having a wonderful time Wow well what a little frolic that little undergrowth was having now which one are you a man you're just going to be an old stately pine tree burn over I've been in the message 40 years and you can't tell me nothing new and I felt everything that can be felt and had everything that and you're just groaning and creaking another church service and another time brother Tim ratray for another hour or two come on you're dead tree there are be sudden living ones there ought to be some people with life in them a man that the joy of the Lord is this Frank a man that there's something in them crying out whether the Holy Spirit shake me today make my roots grow down deeper cause me to reach up higher let me respond to the wind of the Holy Spirit because we are in the season of restoration hey MA so you either moaning and groaning and complaining or you're movin amended breathing and frolicking and dancing and shouting in the winds of the Holy Spirit as he moves forward a man now restoration comes in a season now if you notice except 2 3 verse 19 says repent and be give therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord now this is how what he says frees them to start preparing yourself because you see the restoration comes in seasons and refreshing comes in the seasons make yourself ready for it clean up your lives repent dedicate yourself get into the word amen repent you therefore and be converted that your sins might be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord now you see when a word is given a message comes it begins of season until it brings in the time it brings time into his fullness the Bible talks about the dispensation of the fullness of time so times will reach a fullness but dureena as a time as it comes to times ludus season said times and seasons and so there are seasons within the time as we look toward the fulfillment there are seasons of outpourings of the Holy Ghost now what I've been trying to tell you in all of this is we're in the season of outpouring we're in a season where God is cleansing is simple and by getting people ready getting your sins blotted out amick dealing with issues in your life and my world where that you can be a recipient of that refreshment that is coming from the presence of the Lord now if you don't you just remain an old stately pine tree that's burned over and no life in it I mean you know get while you're living and living there in your pleasures of sin of Laodicea and refusing to move but God's gonna have some movers Amen God's going to have some people that are responded through the Holy Ghost that deal with the issues in their lives hey ma'am now of course just because the word tongues don't mean it fulfills fulfill but let's look here in a buck two and three for the reason is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and shall not lie though it Terry wait for it because it will surely come a man it will not tarry and my worry that again case he misses a man for the reason is yet for an appointed time now Jesus would tell them this it's for an appointed time it ain't for you to know I'm gonna deal with the Gentiles for two thousand years it ain't for you to know there's gonna be two seven Church ages it ain't for you to know this the father has kept that in his own hands he sealed it up and kept it a mystery to the end time but we're not living in the days of the sealing up of the mystery but we are in the days of the opening of the mystery worried now is revealing the season and the time of restoration where there's a people going back to their homeland after all of these years are going back to the Holy Ghost again going back to the

brother Tommy give her the him but he that shall be open to him never give up on the promise you a part you expect that you a smart Utah [Applause] just because you're given a word don't mean it's fulfilled that was our mistake 50 years ago we got a message and thought that is what it was a message we're all ready to go home there was a lot of that word we had to step into and put on a met and dress ourselves e hey man somebody help me now a man you see just because the word come doesn't mean it's fulfilled I was listening to brother Ron Spencer that he shared recently about his daughter Whitney she was a girl that was born and with a with a certain with a certain age to a certain problem she was born with her her womb was this doctor said and I don't understand this but it was upside down and that she was born that way and and would never be able to have a child never so the doctors gave them absolutely no hope when she married her husband Dave he she said well you know the doctor said I can't have a baby he said I'm not marrying you for a baby I married you because I love you and he said so you know they they agreed in marriage and there was no no promise of a baby whatsoever she was she would be a barren woman and so they you know as they who committed their ways to the Lord and was serving him that one night in a prayer line their God gave a word to brother Ron that his daughter Whitney would bring forth a child and after that promise was given he said you know that her husband Davey on that tray was on January 1st I think that he he went to went to work and as he's going to work he hit some black ice spun him around and throwed him into a tree and there he hung upside down for for several hours until that when he was found and and they they rescued him and he was trying to figure out how to to do you know try to to get him down without injuring him worse that found that his shoulder was broken he had broken ribs and broken legs and he had a broken pelvis that was all was absolutely just pulverized and there there you know in that situation word that he was in and all the injuries in that area it made it look even more impossible and brother on even was as he was to giving this testimony he said I he said you don't know how many times the devil talked in my ear you know God gives a promise and many times you know it seems like a little bit of delay you don't know that devil talks right in your ear a man it'll never happen it'll never come it looks more impossible he you know now not only you got a wire girl a room upside down but you got a husband now who's all messed up and and it is very seed life it's gone but you see what's impossible with man it's still possible with God and to those that believe hallelujah man what do you do in situations like that you keep on believing you'll never give up you look there though the pigeon Terry's yeah it shall come to pass wait for it a man cause he'll come in its season and God gives us a word but don't sometimes tell us what season it's gonna be fulfilled in but I tell you friends you're in the season our fulfillment [Applause] I remember cuz we are in an hour of restoration and in an hour of restoration that brings a season of fulfillment a man amen now they're hardly is a day they're hardly is a day that brother Ron don't send me a picture of that miracle man a man even even to the point I'll tell you what a miracle it was the brother brother Ron was given the child's name told nobody just wrote it down in an envelope and there wouldn't when the baby was born and they named it he pulls out the envelope and sit here and it matched exactly God knows your name he knows the name of your child amen sometimes Eden's gotta wait for that predestinated seed to come to that predestinated egg a man to bring for the match but I'll tell you at the appointed time it's shocking the pass hallelujah I remember praying for a parent sex I don't think I prayed that prayer under inspiration in vain I believe global habit Church let up bring forth Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he will not let his promise fall to the ground hallelujah my man I don't care I don't care how long it's been bearing and how long is waited and how many grounders are around there's gonna be some luhan's Gemini ah we restore sayeth the Lord hey ma'am we remember him brother Donny Reagan's sermon on the unser endured hard now how he demonstrated saw waiting on the Prophet he said got down to just two hours just two hours and he gave up a man he forbidden his whole kingdom for two hours a man right on the verge of receiving it Amen oh my butt yeah but in now again you know he he waited way and he waited and he waited and he waited anyway that and he gave up so I've been waiting a long time brother Jim I'm gonna just give up well you know I've got an answer for you people talk about giving up I'm just gonna give up okay well then why don't you why don't you what you give up sin the world your own ideas that your worship is hot dolla tree because we exalted over the Word of God what you just give up give up your uh police do man quit dowdy quick look what happened the wrong time a confession yeah give up give up those things but don't you ever ever ever give up on the promise [Applause] the message came I remember what it meant to us but it's taken years of fulfillment but we're in the season hallelujah amen now as said Israel is not restored so that she recognizes her Messiah but she's in the season of it hey man the time has not yet been fulfilled we don't know the time but we know we're in the season why because we see the victory putting forth herb herb herb buds right amen so we see that there is signs of restoration and seasons of restoration and we see there's processes and and all of these things as we the cogs of God's wheels of prophecy just continue to grind slow but sure heading toward the fulfillment there's a word that's laying out there that she'll be taken into her place by two wings the wings of two prophets that will take him put her in her place hey ma'am hey man also let me just tell you that's what God sent you today is he sent you a message an eagle message gave you the wings of an eagle where you can fly into your place are you with me hey man yeah it's a prophetic message but let me tell you it rides it rides on spirit and in truth I'm an you know how how we have looked and seen as I you know when I was a boy we learned a very tactics of keeping a bird in a pen we learned what to do to get it off balance we'd have an old chicken who wouldn't stay in the pen and Amman we flyout right over the top of it well you know we want that chicken to stay in the pen so what we did is we just slipped in at night when it was sleep on the coop on the roost in the coop and we would take that chicken and we would just take one wing just one and we would we would trim it we'd cut it right back you try not to get into the quick because they're like a fingernail on the feathers and you can make them bleed but if we get right down there and just cut off them feathers harmless didn't hurt the chicken but it couldn't fly it would just flop around and round and round and go to try to fly it could never get off the lever couldn't lift off the ground he just flying around in a circle and fall right back down and I tell you too long we have had that you know in the message are you with me if we go back and look in the pentecostal chickens over there those birds Amanda what they did is they just trimmed true thoughts and they had a lot of spirit and they flop around and round in the circle they couldn't move they couldn't fly they couldn't get out of the fence man but I tell you what they've done to these but the Eagles to keep them earthbound they didn't they didn't do truths they did spirit and we've seen a lot of the spirit been trimmed off you know we can't have divine healings we don't have no altar calls we don't we don't have no prayer meeting we don't have the working of the Spirit we don't want none of those things and they cut that off and what can the church do it can't fly are you with me it takes spirit and truth it takes mechanics and we've done a good job building up the wings of the mechanics and we topped the seals that we talked the mysteries we've been real heavy on that side and neglected the spirit side but it's gonna take two wings if you're gonna fly hey man we got a bunch of fat eagles that aren't used to the heavens where all things are possible I'm not supposed to eat Eagles but there must be fattening look for kill because it won't let them out of the pen they want a coupe of under some burrs some kind of ism a man some kind of doctrinal theology that keeps them down but I'll tell you judge I can tell you like Samson there's somebody out there whose wings were growing out I hope we can see it an evening like Tabernacle their wings are starting to grow out let's talk to get a balance hey man I bought the world but I won't spirit - well I won't the word that I want to know anything - I want the word sandal one soon I want the word but I want supernatural - hey man so I can try the wings of the heavenlies were how things are possible to attend I believe your Nagle don't let somebody make a chicken out of you hey man you're meant to fly brother branham said to eat the church you just listen himself he said the churches then got too soft he said there's no agonizing with God to fulfill his word man you know you know I'm just gonna say something here there's some of you repetitive alter comers who wants to come up here and let me fix you and I'm tired of you hey man you want to be fixed agonize it out with God I'm a donut bar microwave handle a don't you and your old fix have you got a problem get down the dowser call out on his knee a man approach the throne of grace come with faith believing pound on that altar with desperation they might not some little quick fix something another brother situation that's what really needs to happen hey man I'm gay got nothing against somebody coming up to prayer but let me tell you what a most the time is needed is to get down and really agonize amen talking out with God you get soft and lazy want something real quick fix and God bless him and go back to my seat come back again god bless him go back to my seat you deal with the thing get down on your knees and ice God show me where I've been wrong help me Lord to be right you can give me the answer help me to apply that token in my family let me know how to apply it cause it ain't just applying it it's a planet with love believing and knowing is going to work hey man are you with me hey man you apply with love believing and knowing it's gonna work man didn't they'd say you know even even in our marriage sincerity man I've got it you know you listen to me all right you know that I'll tell you what the real thing is becoming a real man get down on your knees and humble down before God let me make a real leader out of your home a man then take the short skirts out then it'll deal with the other issues of pornography it's Susan and the movie issues and all the other adultery things that you're bringing into your life Hilldale and I love it and it won't be long that you'll be exercising those wings and fine up about those things and rejoice it and taking your little league with hold your wings and flying around and say they got good for giving us so many blessings hello amen amen now the message has come we don't need another message this one works it works as I've said before when brother branham left the scene he left us a car that was running he didn't leave us one with all mechanics in no spark he didn't leave us one with all spark and no and no mechanics no word he left us a car that would drive it would drive down to the Holy Ghost it would drive to divine healing a man it would drive anywhere you would need to go a man because he left a car in good mechanical order and brothers you don't have to tamper with it by trying to read between the lines and trying to plan something it ain't in the manual ma'am but just take the manual take the message I'll apply the mat-su don't need fixin you need fixin [Applause] hey man but he left us a car that's running and I'll tell you this morning hey man if we don't maybe we'll get the mechanics back in the way that brother branham had it and the dynamics the way brother branham had it what we believe in healing again miracles again signs again the Holy Ghost again the power of God again hey man I'll tell you you can start that engine and it'll just occur and hit on 16 cylinders because it Jesus hit on 16 cylinders so we'll divide whatever he did she'll do the same thing mmm so the message came but of course it's been years of fulfillment but we're in the season amen we're in the season we're in the season look stand up how old are you 17 would you know like the Lord to come when I was 17 I would that's when I turned electricity on in this church they're still fighting classic toys the RV fight take your sword against reality [Applause] Louie Terry it shall come to pass a man restoration is still owned the holy ghost is still falling the spirit of time is still here there's a shot at the king in the myths that's the holy cows where can among these people there's a way blue and that there's a new generation that can move with the Holy Spirit [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah it's the word of promise word to promise the message has come yet Israel is not yet restored so that she recognizes her Messiah but the fig tree is putting forth its branches we could see a little tiny signs I don't know about you but in the spring sometimes especially when the winter has been long and wet and rainy and storming and all the other stuff I go to looking for spring I go to looking for signs of restoration I rejoice when I see the first daffodil stick up its head and start shining I say all glory ain't spring yet but it's coming hey man I go and I look and I see some of the other precautious little trees that that meant that our head of some of those others and I finally see another one come and this is where that might I see a red bud begin to put forth its blues kind of say spring is Klaus and then we're in the season it hey man and I hear Wars going on and old man winter comes from the north and he comes down you know you know with this may blasted and you have something raised up in the south and began to blow back against it now you know just because it loses a battle now and then don't mean it also war I'm a boy long that no man winners gonna go back to his home be chased back by the warm winds of spring and restoration is going to come you know what because the Sun has provided the light to let it happen and I'm gonna tell you Turks we are in the season a restoration because the Sun has provided the light [Applause] war against it till it flies it out so that wind you're feeling this morning it's just one of those resistance to Old Man Winter that wants to make you barren and cold and worship like Amish or Baptists hello somebody get the old Amish out of your bones today I'm old order yeah you're all right oh hey you know you don't know about me you know I do know about you you need a good dose of the Holy Ghost limber up and move with the spirit of God get an action invincible damn your needs ranging around here we'll start praying then the groaning ain't going to do it the complaining ain't going to do it but when you get the callin on heaven Kevin's gonna serve on them - yeah are you with me now so you see it is as we say it you know Israel's not yet restored but we see the fig tree now the Bible said that when you see the fig tree and you can read it yourself and all the other trees when you see the fig tree and all the other trees so it's not as Israel hey man it's all the other trees man they begin to put forth their buds mountain you know even around here our pecan is about the last one to come out you know in Italy it'll ignore everybody else and standard land will not come out until it finally finally begrudgingly puts forth a little oh okay let me check and see if the temperatures just right it's okay it's okay to be a pecan tree then make good then make good pies come on out [Applause] you never come out you're dead cuz I'm telling you the dark ages that killed the life out of me I've got laughing me here it comes here it comes hey man now Israel is the type and we are the anti-type answer type means that we're the fulfillment of the type so you have a type and then the Anna type and the type means I'm no type I'm not typing I'm the fulfillment a man I'm a match to the type but I'm not a type and man a type is a shadow of good things to come it's an allegory in this example but but again you know an anti-type is the fulfillment I want to tell you a man we're we're reaching the time we're tights running out and when this amount of time of typing another generation to come man we're not typing we are the other type they do we can look back and say they were type they were tight why even Luther was a type of justification Wesley was a type of sanctification Pentecost was a type of Pentecost hey man oh you say brother different type of Benegal yeah in a way well you know a shadow doesn't show you all the real details in fact you can get the shadows in right now I'm looking the way the lights is hitting this now I've got about three or four hands there on the desk in my shadow well that ain't the way it is kind of reminds me today I was trying to I was trying to listen to something coming down we were listening to to enlighten and a lot of times on Sunday morning they'll have you know some pretty decent songs I you know the about taken they've got taking a this Southern Gospel and turned it in to Country Gospel and is a tear in my beer and we were doing this and doing that and you know some story and whatever it's not about Jesus no more it likes a lot of inspiration a man likes a lot of inspiration and though you know but I'm listening to some some of those songs and here they come out I'll say well that's a pretty good group the Collinsworth holy holy holy Blessed Holy Trinity God in three persons Holy Trinity or Blessed Trinity where's a good song I just turned the thing off and I said three persons there's never been gods not three persons let me tell you what you got here you got a one God Bible this is not a to Lord Bible it's not a three God Bible it's not a to God Bible it's not a three person Bible amen it's where God was a person in Christ so you got God the spirit who was a person in Christ are you with me man that's a one God Bible but I tell you what you know they get all confused as we go along you know even on what the Godhead is about and I don't find the worship in that now but I want you to understand that as we as I said you know we we got a hunger in our heart we're looking for that restoration for that for that we're in the season of the rapture but it's but not truly the time of the rapture now that's where people get confused so the Lord has come the temple you believe the Lord has already come no I don't believe he's already come I believe that he is appeared and he appeared in a prophet bringing the message and we heard a message he come in Word form to a prophet that's his appearing man I believe he's hearing Brad form but that's still not as coming so well now the bride coming to Christ yeah is Chris Christ coming as a bride in bride form but it's his appearing in his people hey man I just heard about he he appeared the other day in the Philippines I heard that he's appearing in Japan I hear that he's appearing and evening like Tabernacle I hear that he appeared and brain bleeds left and alopecia was cured and cancer went and I trouble when I hear that he appeared in our youth camp and Devils couldn't stay I've shared that that there was a people in his dead casting out Devils using his name acting in his stead delegated authority via haven't been filled with the Holy Ghost that's his appearing but he's still coming we're in the season of his coming if he didn't come with a if he didn't appear in the inward form to a prophet well then we would still be you know trying to make this a three God Bible are you with me hey man if he didn't if he didn't do that if he didn't bring a word that wouldn't be a bride because the bride is a creation from that word going forth you might have missed that but you are the spoken word the original see not denominational see but the original seed a member cuz a message come and this day that actually spoke you into existence you did not let me say it again the bride of this last day did not exist until a prophet came and when he brought a message it spoke a bride into existence you are the existence of the spoken word people bride now so if it hadn't gotten to prophet well then in this in the season and the season if you hadn't come to a prophet there be no bride if there was no bride there would be no one living to come for now you get a you know forget what we're talking about in the sense of their ages we know there's a bride in every age we're not talking about that we're talking about the living bride and if there wouldn't be a prophet comes there wouldn't be a people ready prepared for his coming is that right so we've the season then brought a profit on the season and then the season opens up and what happened then from that coming out that prophet listen it's the seventh seal which is to come to the Lord which is the you know if brother Branham told us it is like a candlestick going up and up as it breaks the silence and make it known to mysteries and one of the mysteries God had in his mind was I'm gonna have a bride in this last day that a match this one over here in the beginning and she matched Christ so this one match Christ so this is one the mysteries you got to understand the mystery is I'm not calling a denomination you remember in Paul would would say now I'm gonna preach you the mystery of Christ I'm gonna preach you the mystery of Christ and then preaching you the mystery of Christ I'm going to show you that God's gonna call a people out of the Gentiles sake so now God does the same thing that when we come back to Paul's gospel again he shows us to give the mystery I'm gonna call a people back to the homeland back to the Word of God come on I've ever tried nascent people wherever they're scattered I mean wherever my seat has been dispersed I'm gonna call them all back to the homeland why are we here why are we here the same reason the Jews are there so the Messiah can be revealed to them Wow have we returned back to the homeland not just so we can have the fruits of it of healing and miracles and signs and wonders but know what we can have more than that where the Messiah will come where the season will give way to the time hallelujah so now we are in the season of the rapture but not truly in the time of the rapture now there again I'm not I'm not even trying to to argue quotes with unions while I got a quote we're brother Brent said this is a wrap your time that's not what I'm talking about the time of the rapture is that at that moment when we're changed when when we are caught up to meet the Lord and we see him that's still our Blessed hope and no matter how much he come in a prophet born it ain't complete yet no matter how much he's here in Bradford it ain't complete yet it's not gonna be complete a time isn't gonna be fulfilled for the rapture until we see him as he is and when we see them we shall be like him are you with me now so now we are having these times season times of refreshing being made ready by repentance hey man now I'm not gonna preach long this morning so hold on your seat but if they just want to ask you today is there a true ambassador to the world that will hold up your Bible to declare this is my deed to this land of the Holy Ghost amen the grounds the grounds of truth and spirit that Abraham Isaac Jacob Peter James John welcome this is my deed to divine healing a man that gives me my right to it this is my deed through the Holy Ghost it gives me my right to it this is my deed to the resurrection it gives me my right to it this is my deed to my body change and to the rapture there's gotta be some ambassadors that you pick up your Bible and you begin to say this is my deed I'm reading it out to the devil I'm reading it out to the world this word gives me the right to have ever divine promise of God it is mine this is my land why he said so a man I'm I tell you we appeal to the Whig one we appeal to the Supreme Court they say there's no justice in this land where there's justice here we have heard from the Whig one you know what I'm coming out of Revelation chapter one he was clothed a man with a will and his head was as white as wool are you with me oh yes a man we have heard from the Whig one we have heard from the a man of God there is no higher authority there is no higher say and he says and he says man the judge says the supreme judge says a man the other judges men had turned down our appeal a man they may have refused to hear our case they may have denied us the right to it but the Supreme Court has spoken [Applause] give you every word of it it's yours it's the deed to your inheritance hallelujah the people of the book are on the earth possessing the ancient places hallelujah amen hooey we are possessing the ancient places are you with me now and man we are we are we can possess Calvary Amy come on Israel can go over there and say this is ours and this is ours and that is ours I might we can take you here's where here's where that Gaga the wiles and here's the Gordonstoun and it's what they call it after the man who who said it was the tomb of Christ is an empty tomb that's all I know about it hey man I'm glad it's empty one hey man don't give me one that's filled up I know better than that this is an empty tomb and so the people of the book are now processing the answered places we can possess Calvary hey man I've been there it's my possession I now down there the blood came upon me yeah hallelujah I traded my sins in there I don't have any sins anymore I am now his righteousness Lord and God are you with me mmm why because I've been to Calvary I've been there it's my possession if I need to go there today I can go back to Calvary again if I need another experience of the Cross I can go right back to it again I can go to Calvary because why the deed says it's mine and I'm in the land and in the lamb is Calvary that day on Calvary we can possess the upper room I wonder does anybody in this church can't believe we can possess the upper room hallelujah Amen that we can possess the upper room Amen that we too can be filled like they were on the day of Pentecost and the same accent and the same way and the same demonstration work in the same manner because we possess to the children of a smell belong to the wild sea it belongs to the royal sea and have the upper room needed today and get on refilling of that same Holy Ghost hey man I can possess and I can walk down the pass nopal did hallelujah I have I have had my own Damascus experience oh man when I was going the wrong way he stopped me a light over shattered me hallelujah man Oh glory to God I can well I can walk the paths of Peter James and John we can welcome the waters of our Galilee somebody help me preach now a man we can walk on the waters of our Galilee oh yes let us possess the land of our inheritance for the lamb holds the title deed and by revelation the mysteries of its seals have been revealed in the land of the book and all his promises now lay open to us we are to possess what was once held in God's power it is the time and the season of restoration will you restore it at this time no you're gonna go and dispersal you're going to go down and you as a nation you won't be restored that time and season is held in the hands of God but the seasons have changed hey man John what about it yeah you want to give us that message for raptured faith no can't do it he told me seal it up come on seal it up don't ride it and my butt aren't you glad God didn't just say you'll never get it he didn't say that they'll never historians will no I ain't gonna do that he'd say he said not listen it's it's not the time and the season for that let me show you what is time and season for a man get in the upper room and get in dude with powerful high and then you'll see what time and season it is but do you notice now we have called time down through the centuries and slowly slowly slowly we finally reached here come on amen now so you see we're here at the time and the season of the restoration where the kingdom is being restored how many years have we prayed that kingdom come and here his kingdom is coming in fullness the kingdom of heaven approaches the rapture approaches so close that seven angels break out of those dimensions a man revealed the seals and the mysteries of God so that you wouldn't be left here in the ignorance because it's restoration time what was held up from other ages is my being revealed to you and I say to you today blessing or your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for profits and transits messenger and even that Paul himself wanted to see our day and didn't get to see it but you have arrived The Tree of Life is footing both another branch a man a book of Acts is being written there's a new generation rising in the power of God and say he's the same yesterday and day and forever there are Eagles that can fly in the heavens where all things are possible took them that believe hey mom every even the season even the season the season the Jews longed for four years I talked about it at new year ever Passover the Jews for century commended their celebration of the Passover with a toast next year John I said next year Jerusalem be quite honest with you if those people down there in that Sabbath over there in California in that synagogue if they don't obey the Word of God they wouldn't have been there when a gunman came in here to found the empty synagogue if they would have heard and listened and obeyed the call I'm not condoning what was done not by any means but you know right over here in California gunman goes in there and just goes shooting them you know as they're in their Passover services killing people indiscriminately if I uh don't let me die on the homeland I sure don't want to die in California man if I die let me die in my homeland if I die let me die fighting for that homeland if I die are you with me as a Jew we're talking about if I had fully them with the Israel I bro you'll see your natural see if you're their natural see don't let me die here let me die in that homeland defending that homeland a man in the place of safety are you with me and I say that if I died don't let me die on some denomination somewhere don't let me die in some unbelief somewhere hallelujah don't let me die mixed up in some old theology that's price dead and put up by the roots let me die believe in this word yesterday today forever and people be able to say Tim Burton gave his life and his last breath defending his promise possessing his land that should no longer be the cry of the Jews next year Jerusalem hey Matt you know what they ought to be shouting you know what they'll be saying that at now in their homeland there is it take their Passover next year Temple Mount next year the prophets that are promised next year the Messiah that's what they ought to be saying now and then it shouldn't be it meant tourism we ought to be able to say Dell they'd be able to say we have Jerusalem but next year we want more than Jerusalem I'm on that ought to be it you know again you know not next year that was the word the word reveal the words been revealed we're in the homeland we ought to say that God let me be in that place they meant expand my borders and say let's hear the body change this year next year coming up on the millennial reign then that year Eden again cry resonated out of our hearts next year we'll expand our borders does that bring this down these few last dots I want you to stay with me for a moment just give me just a little more time the Land of Israel became a desolate desolate desert became a Holland wilderness because the people lost the connection to the word therefore they lost their connection to their homeland I'm and of course as I've said for much of the ages the the land of promise of the Holy Ghost became a desolate desert in a howling wilderness because the people left the word and the dispersal of course didn't leave the Jewish people in a good spiritual condition it left them in a even more hardened heart and unbelief the dispersal down to Babylon that happened before Jesus came you know in the times of Daniel you read of him Jeremiah so on like that word the dispersal was going on down to Babylon it was there in Babylon that they kind of because they had no temple to worship in they created synagogues in the formation of Pharisees and Sadducees shall I say denominations begin to form because of the dispersal they were out of their homeland and out of the place of true worship and so it brought about that that you know there again it brought about formations of synagogues where that each had an independent rabbi spewing out his own thoughts nonsense so rather than being united under God they either actually became in the dispersal further away from God are you with me and so you went out with different synagogues and different ones with different rabbis and independent rabbis and each one with their ideas and they would give their lectures and they were these were the synagogue's that Jesus would go to and that he would go to the synagogues in and he would bring his his message now the dispersal from the lamb brought about the rejection of their Messiah because it brought about the acceptance of the sayings of the rabbi's creeds of men that exalted those Creed's to a greater position than the actual Word of God itself you see you have with the Jews you you have them who have the the literal word that was given and then you have the oral law a law of traditions passed down from their from their elders right on down and so you have the world and you have their oral law that they it steamed over the word itself now you with me now so you know again again um I just want to kind of bring that down for a moment because this is what the Jews would do Jesus said by your traditions by your oral laws that you've extreme greater than the written word itself you have you have you have made the Word of God by those traditions of none effect is everybody with me right now now you know it said about the message movement that that we have the Bible and that we also accept William branham's sermons as as oral on scriptures and I didn't want to address that while we're here just a moment because many times we quote from the prophet of God and we speak but let me tell you we never exalt exalt there are words even of a prophet above the word of God now we are moving those that wants to make that the message the absolute the Bible is our absolute that was brother branham's absolute that is our absolute and many of you and he taught us if you get an idea from something that I've said that is contrary this Bible you forget your idea and come back to the Word of God oh man we got to base it on the word come on somebody hey man we can't base it on an oral tradition we must base it on the written word of God amen so the message was not to connect us to a prophet but to connect us by that prophet back to the word again hey man are you with me and brother branham brought a message that is exactly in harmony with the Bible and if you get something out of it that's contrary to the Bible you ain't understanding it right and you need to quit reading between the lines and go back to what was said on the line are you with me now but now so now likewise as Israel when did their dispersal likewise the early church was a mighty church it was a fruitful church with signs and wonders miracles dedicated lies you didn't lie on the Holy Ghost in that church you got hauled away dead like Ananias and Sapphira and made the church stay pretty clean amen but it wasn't long until the land with his promised fruits were left barren a howling wilderness and wasteland unfruitful and the people were dispersed pulled away captive down into spiritual Babylon and doing so they lost their connection with the book the word and they even forsook this one God Bible for multiple dear but I got some news for you we have returned because there was a word that was said I will restore sayeth the Lord and we are not a part of the dispersal we are part of the return and there's some ambassadors in this building this morning hey man are you ambassadors for Christ or your representative have you been sending his name have you been commissioned by God have you been called as a bride of Jesus Christ better take their Bible and say this is my deed to ever promise in this book healing his mind so base in his mind the desires of my heart is mine I can have what oh so ever I say because I am his ambassador unconnected to this word and by this word I'm connected to Christ will you stand together with me praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus how wonderful you are what a mighty God you are the promises I will restore saith the Lord and we're in that hour of restoration amen we're in that hour then get ready for your
