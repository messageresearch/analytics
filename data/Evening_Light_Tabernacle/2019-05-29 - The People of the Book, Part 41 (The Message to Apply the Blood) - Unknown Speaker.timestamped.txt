[20:11] together in your name to love you to
[20:14] serve you a mind to declare your saving
[20:19] to deliver and we're here tonight as a
[20:23] children of the king the cast Satan out
[20:26] amenda take dominion over every evil
[20:29] spirit they were trying to hold God's
[20:32] people here's a letdown in the name of
[20:35] Jesus we asked your blessings upon us
[20:37] tonight as we worship you and give you
[20:40] praise and honor and glory amen and amen
[20:46] god bless you amen
[20:49] oh my what a what a word in that song
[20:54] tonight amen
[20:57] Exodus chapter 12 verse 13 Exodus
[21:02] chapter 12 verse 13 and the blood shall
[21:08] be to you for a token upon the houses
[21:11] where you are and when I see the Blood I
[21:14] will pass over you and the plague shall
[21:17] not be upon you to destroy you when I
[21:21] smite the land of Egypt and then first
[21:25] Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 11 now
[21:30] all these things happened unto them for
[21:32] an examples and they are written for our
[21:36] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[21:42] world are come do you believe we're here
[21:47] amen god bless you you can be seated
[21:50] tonight I'm going to be speaking on you
[21:53] them to them on the message to apply the
[21:57] blood we spoke Sunday on a service and I
[22:02] wanted to come tonight and speak again
[22:05] as I won't be here Sunday I'm going to
[22:08] brother Jason Jackson's meet with
[22:10] brother Ron Spencer there for meetings
[22:12] there this weekend so I would appreciate
[22:15] your prayers but I spoke Sunday upon the
[22:18] message of the Exodus and I feel like it
[22:23] was probably one of the most important
[22:26] sermons that I would preach this year
[22:28] but I think every sermon that we hear
[22:32] is important it's vital for us to take a
[22:35] hold of the Bible said lay hold of
[22:38] eternal life and it's really important
[22:41] that when the word comes forth that you
[22:43] take hold of it no matter who is
[22:46] speaking but I'm reminded of some things
[22:51] and I I don't want to spend a lot of
[22:52] background tonight we his wins tonight
[22:55] we want to get right into the word but I
[22:58] will just tell you right up front that I
[23:02] have a lot to say tonight and so I will
[23:06] try to be cognitive time but at the same
[23:09] time I hope you understand also that I I
[23:12] have to obey the Holy Spirit and in the
[23:16] message the token brother branham's said
[23:18] that now we're living in the shadows and
[23:20] the wrath is ready to strike
[23:23] and God is requiring a token that you
[23:26] yourself have received his token the
[23:29] Holy Ghost it is the only way and the
[23:32] only sign that God will ever pass
[23:34] because it is the literal life of Jesus
[23:39] Christ return back to the believer and
[23:43] so as we were speaking Sunday that just
[23:47] before he preaches a sermon on the token
[23:49] that the Holy Ghost is a requirement for
[23:51] the rapture brother Branham is
[23:54] recognizing that so many of his
[23:56] followers on the church members that
[23:59] they're without the Holy Ghost there's
[24:01] something I have evidently missing in
[24:04] their lives and this realization is what
[24:07] prompts him to preach on the token now
[24:10] this wasn't meant to be a sermon of
[24:13] condemnation but rather to identify the
[24:17] lack so that the problem of sin and
[24:20] unbelief could be healed and God's
[24:22] people delivered and I just want to also
[24:25] add to you tonight that my preaching is
[24:29] not to condemn anybody and you know
[24:33] we're we're not we're not out to dam you
[24:35] but rather to see you delivery and the
[24:39] Prophet was bothered that even after the
[24:43] supernatural revelation
[24:45] of where night after night the angel of
[24:47] the Lord came bringing the voice of the
[24:49] thunders the people although they
[24:52] intellectually heard and understood the
[24:55] seals they were still missing the life
[24:58] are the token that that literal life of
[25:02] Christ and I just like to share with you
[25:06] some scripture here for a moment as we
[25:08] go to first Corinthians 13:1 though I
[25:11] speak with tongues of men and angels and
[25:14] have not charity I am become as sounding
[25:17] brass or a tinkling cymbal and though I
[25:21] have the gift of prophecy and understand
[25:24] all mysteries and all knowledge and
[25:26] though I have all faith so I could
[25:28] remove mountains and have not charity I
[25:31] am nothing so as we look at here Paul is
[25:35] really looking at both sides of the
[25:37] spectrum that you know as the pendulum
[25:39] swings one way or the other and and he
[25:42] could say Noel you know all the gifts of
[25:45] prophecy or the tongues of men and
[25:48] angels are you know though I have all
[25:51] faith that I could move mountains and
[25:53] have not charity I am nothing but then
[25:56] he also covers the other side of the
[25:58] spectrum and he says though I understand
[26:01] all mysteries and all knowledge and have
[26:05] not charity
[26:05] now charity of course is the basic
[26:09] nature of God because God is love
[26:12] when brother Abraham went beyond the
[26:14] curtain of time he was told this is what
[26:17] you preached was perfect love this is
[26:20] the Holy Ghost so we know then the Holy
[26:23] Ghost truly is the very nature of God
[26:25] which love is his basic nature and of
[26:30] course in verse John 4:16 he says and we
[26:34] we have known and believed that love
[26:37] that God has to us god is love and he
[26:41] that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God
[26:44] and God in him so you cannot be a
[26:48] Christian and not have the love of God
[26:50] it is the nature of God to love perfect
[26:53] love it is the Holy Ghost so we can just
[26:56] say that
[26:57] and the same thing if we have not
[26:59] charity or have not the Holy Spirit
[27:02] we're just sounding brass and tinkling
[27:04] cymbal without the Holy Ghost and all
[27:07] the knowledge you know that we have paid
[27:09] to move mountains no matter which side
[27:11] of the pendulum that it swings when it
[27:14] goes to the intellect or to the
[27:16] emotional or to the signs and wonders it
[27:19] matters not you must have the nature of
[27:21] God and this is the whole thing that we
[27:25] must realize because you can manifest
[27:27] many things and yet lack the basic
[27:31] element of God's own nature now the
[27:34] blood as we showed and you can look at
[27:37] the illustration here that if it was
[27:40] must strike the two side post and the
[27:44] lentil and the blood from the lamb was
[27:47] used to strike I want to just emphasize
[27:51] that word strike not likely or to gently
[27:54] paint but but it was more than that it
[27:58] was to strike a mind to strike the both
[28:03] the sides of the doorposts and the
[28:06] lintel now it would not be struck on the
[28:09] threshold of the floor because you see
[28:12] the the Jews were to pass through the
[28:16] blood and under the blood but no one is
[28:20] to trample the blood of the lamb
[28:22] underfoot so it is not on the threshold
[28:25] a man to be trampled underfoot we must
[28:28] be really careful not to trample the
[28:31] blood Amen but to hold it in great
[28:34] esteem and realizing it's our life now
[28:38] the blood of course there is the Holy
[28:40] Spirit and it must be applied to every
[28:43] entrance and I want to emphasize every
[28:46] entrance of in your house the body the
[28:50] spirit or the soul now brother Branham
[28:53] would tell us in modern events made
[28:55] clear by prophecy he said there's many
[28:57] people just can't believe it even
[28:59] spirit-filled people I'm gonna give you
[29:02] one that a Chokin the baptism of the
[29:04] Holy Ghost don't mean you're goin in
[29:07] not at all not on that don't have
[29:09] anything to do with your soul that's the
[29:12] baptisms he hears the inside soul in
[29:15] here that has to come from God
[29:18] but on the outside you can have five
[29:21] senses and out and inlets and to contact
[29:24] your home and the inland side you have a
[29:27] spirit and then there then there you
[29:29] have five outlets your conscience and
[29:32] love and so forth the five outlets to
[29:34] that spirit but remember in that spirit
[29:37] you can be baptized with the genuine
[29:41] Spirit of God and still be lost it is
[29:45] the soul that lives that was ordained of
[29:49] God now so of course you know again this
[29:53] is very important for us to focus upon
[29:55] remember we want more than the Holy
[29:58] Spirit of on our flesh and more than in
[30:02] upon our spirit round but we want it
[30:05] within the soul and man deep within the
[30:09] soul with and and it'll only take effect
[30:11] if it has a seed gene of God on the
[30:14] inside otherwise no matter how much it
[30:17] falls upon it the ring can fall but it
[30:19] will only manifest what seeds on the
[30:21] inside now but because of the lack of
[30:25] this revelation of Christ personally to
[30:29] you this is why today we have so many
[30:32] divisions around the message and this is
[30:36] why the tangents there and the tangent
[30:38] is system different line of thought than
[30:41] what the messenger had and it's
[30:43] deception that comes through wisdom but
[30:47] I want you to understand the Holy Ghost
[30:49] don't come through wisdom the Holy Ghost
[30:52] doesn't come through intellectual
[30:54] knowledge the Holy Ghost comes by a
[30:57] personal experience and encounter with
[31:01] God that's how the Holy Ghost comes now
[31:04] so the reason of the divisions and and
[31:08] you know and this is as I said the
[31:11] reason of the divisions and and of
[31:14] course you know the real mystery of
[31:16] Christ coming in Bride form is summer
[31:20] halogen can see you know he's here he's
[31:23] here Brother Jimmy's he's here in Brides
[31:25] form but they don't know how he came
[31:27] that way
[31:28] he comes in bride form through the new
[31:31] birth they might not through the wisdom
[31:34] of man not by the imparting of knowledge
[31:38] but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[31:41] that's exactly how he is here and bride
[31:45] for a man now
[31:47] in Christ's of mystery brother Brennan
[31:49] said God holds us Kizer
[31:51] alone no theologian can tell you it is
[31:55] not known it's hid from them they know
[31:57] nothing about it so the skills when you
[32:00] say I got a pH ll DS you only make to me
[32:04] and I believe to God and to any true
[32:06] believer that means you're just that
[32:09] much further away you just backed off
[32:13] God is not known by education he is not
[32:18] known about how to explain it
[32:21] Amen God is known by simplicity and a
[32:25] revelation of Jesus Christ to the mouse
[32:27] a literate person a man not your
[32:31] theology it's a revelation of Jesus
[32:34] Christ upon Disrupt I build my church no
[32:38] other rocks except that no other things
[32:40] accepted no other Roman rock no other
[32:42] Protestant rock no other school no
[32:45] nothing but exactly on the revelation of
[32:48] Jesus Christ through the new birth he is
[32:51] born in there he injects his own life
[32:55] and your life is gone hey man I'm the
[32:59] life of Christ is projecting itself
[33:01] through you with the preeminence to the
[33:03] people that they can see the very life
[33:06] and works and signs and wonders that he
[33:09] did is doing the same thing through you
[33:13] Amen outside of that the rest of it's
[33:16] not even called you at all what's God's
[33:18] great revelation unfolding by lack of
[33:21] this revelation listen to this prophet
[33:24] is why we have so many different
[33:27] divisions among us and summits Mochrie
[33:31] so much to be
[33:33] among us it's because people laugh that
[33:37] revelation see they laugh that
[33:40] revelation the teacher now what
[33:42] revelation no certainly not you know
[33:45] some my you know great exposition of the
[33:48] seals and great knowledge that the
[33:50] thunders and can tell us all about all
[33:52] of these different mystery that's not
[33:54] the knowledge that brother Brennan where
[33:56] the revelation brother bragging said
[33:57] they're lacking they're lacking the
[34:00] revelation of Christ personally to them
[34:05] they said they lack that revelation the
[34:09] teachers a man I tell you it's time to
[34:12] every teacher every preacher take stock
[34:15] Andrea and makes them make sure they
[34:17] have that revelation whether they
[34:20] understand anything else they know God
[34:22] this is what brother Brandon would say
[34:25] Betsy author and man you you know you
[34:28] make men know your Bible better than I
[34:30] do you maybe I'll be able to out our
[34:32] give me but I know the author and this
[34:35] is where every person has to got to come
[34:37] to my Gogi author and I do you
[34:40] understand this right you understand
[34:42] that right you have a great handle on
[34:44] this sir a great handle on this mystery
[34:46] here's some mystery you better know I'm
[34:49] out the mystery of Christ personally to
[34:53] you Paul
[34:55] after this great revelation of Christ
[34:57] said in first Corinthians a second
[34:59] chapter and had he said that I never
[35:02] came to you let's just look at it
[35:05] listen to the great Apostle Paul the
[35:07] intellectual sterlin Christ
[35:09] 1st Corinthians 2 1 and I brethren when
[35:12] I came to you I came not with excellency
[35:15] of speech or wisdom declaring unto you
[35:19] the testimony of God so that I never
[35:21] said I'm dr. so-and-so for I determined
[35:25] not to know anything among you save
[35:28] Jesus Christ and him crucified
[35:33] and I was with you and much in weakness
[35:36] and in fear and in much trembling and my
[35:38] speech and my preaching was not with
[35:41] enticing words of man's wisdom but in
[35:45] demonstration of the Spirit and the
[35:48] power I say God give us some more poems
[35:51] hey Manuel you know where we have been
[35:54] we have been nightly inundated with
[35:56] wisdom of man ideas of man and creeds a
[36:01] man but give us some cause a man that my
[36:05] preaching was not with enticing words of
[36:08] man's wisdom but in the demonstration of
[36:11] the Spirit and the power that your faith
[36:14] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[36:16] but in the power of God that's where
[36:19] your faith has gonna stand not because I
[36:22] understand all of the mysteries but
[36:25] because I knew him and he changed me and
[36:29] I'm not what I lost a man and there's a
[36:33] hunger and a desire in my heart but more
[36:36] of that God too often the message has
[36:41] been preached with arrogance full of
[36:44] human reason and wisdom and pride and it
[36:47] produces fleshly proud arrogant people
[36:51] instead of the humility of the lamb now
[36:57] this is what brother Breton would say in
[37:00] Christ some mystery notice in the last
[37:03] days Luther is doing the same thing he
[37:06] to see if the devil doing the same thing
[37:09] building up a hybrid church a hybrid by
[37:13] hybrid members hybrid by knowledge
[37:16] instead of the word by intellect some
[37:19] men instead of born again man building
[37:22] an intellectual kingdom that will
[37:24] outshine Christ
[37:26] a little-bitty flock see what's the
[37:28] water is it that did that fallen angels
[37:31] the Bible said ulis fallen angels who
[37:33] listened to Lucifer instead of Christ
[37:36] who that once belonged to is that right
[37:39] Mansa brother madam tells us this is
[37:41] what the devil's this is what he'll be
[37:44] doing in this last day trying to hide
[37:46] the church by knowledge a man building
[37:51] an intellectual kingdom Amen that will
[37:54] outshine Christ little bitty flop oh my
[37:57] fallen angels we'll get into it now
[38:00] but notice here's the key that nature of
[38:04] Christ is missing the lamb isn't that
[38:09] now this is a problem with all this
[38:12] intellectual learning the lamb is in
[38:14] think the blood isn't there imagine it I
[38:18] just want you to look what brother
[38:20] Branham just plain love kindness
[38:22] humility that right never such a humble
[38:27] man didn't puff him up didn't make him
[38:30] proud they'd become arrogant come a man
[38:33] you see the characteristics we witness
[38:36] too often in the ministry is heady
[38:39] highminded this arrogance that's a
[38:42] spiritual sick person brother man told
[38:46] us an image --is of christ he said
[38:49] remember is only the sick that that
[38:51] man's attention service just a sick they
[38:55] demand attention and when you see a
[38:57] preacher and he's mayor not limited to a
[39:00] preacher but may I limit to every person
[39:02] every church member that wants attention
[39:04] I'm somebody just remember there's of
[39:08] spiritual sick person there needing
[39:11] attention there need the attention of
[39:14] the Spirit of God that it can't give
[39:17] them something that will take that
[39:19] attitude out of them and heal them from
[39:22] their selfishness big ideas and big me
[39:25] and little you the Holy Ghost makes us
[39:28] all the same a man too much spiritual
[39:32] sickness an image you know what anemic
[39:34] is if somebody had got any blood they
[39:37] walked funny their top see the tip see
[39:40] top see all over the time and that's
[39:42] what's the matter with many of our
[39:44] church members today they are
[39:46] anemic they need a blood transfusion
[39:50] Calgary that a give them rich royal
[39:54] blood
[39:55] that a make them walk in the
[39:57] old-fashioned Holy Ghost to that way of
[39:59] God that give them something to live for
[40:02] give them a confidence that'll make them
[40:05] walk in the image of their Lord but you
[40:08] know again you know all of a sudden
[40:11] because of our superior knowledge we've
[40:14] been weird the bride's you know the
[40:16] elite the elect and God God just loves
[40:18] to dam other people you know the rest of
[40:22] you that are just too stupid to get our
[40:24] superior knowledge and understanding God
[40:27] loves to damn you what in the world why
[40:30] why are these kind of attitudes coming
[40:33] out today because of the lack of a new
[40:36] birth because the problem of promoting a
[40:40] superior knowledge which came from Satan
[40:44] it didn't come from God the spirit of
[40:47] God hey man now let me just say
[40:50] something to you let's get it clear
[40:52] revelation is not knowledge revelation
[40:57] is not knowledge
[40:59] brother Branham said to Lucifer
[41:01] attention exalts himself above the
[41:04] humble Word of God by the knowledge of
[41:06] the revelation and he has placed himself
[41:09] by seminary education and theology until
[41:13] they got themselves up and if you don't
[41:15] belong in their group then you're out
[41:17] wash hmm you see Revelation is not
[41:21] knowledge revelation is a supernatural
[41:24] happening and that you may not know even
[41:28] how to explain it you just know you got
[41:30] it
[41:31] that's what revelation is I mean
[41:34] knowledge puffeth up but charity
[41:37] edifieth that right hey man you know
[41:42] that the knowledge city is puffing up
[41:43] today is we're now the mercy seat
[41:46] goodness me let me tell you if grace and
[41:49] mercy is put in the hands of men then
[41:51] we're all lost except for those who will
[41:54] come down and worship at their feet
[41:57] a man but I'm glad that mercy doesn't
[42:00] lay in men
[42:01] let's see ladies in the mercy seat what
[42:05] Christ is the high priest a man the
[42:09] death angel will not be kept away by
[42:11] knowledge but by the life of the Lamb
[42:15] and his nature displayed now as I told
[42:20] you brother branham goes into the woods
[42:23] and he hunts but he can't even huddle
[42:26] thinking and and praying about the
[42:29] problems that he see he returns to the
[42:32] tabernacle and he preaches to them two
[42:35] sermons we spoke about that Sunday both
[42:38] sermons he telling him what was
[42:40] bothering him first sermon was a
[42:42] question how can I overcome his next
[42:46] sermon is the answer the token you must
[42:49] have the token the Holy Ghost that's the
[42:52] only way you'll overcome and then he
[42:54] begins to explain this was needed to
[42:58] follow the seals and I'm just going to
[43:02] tell you friends we need something to
[43:05] follow the seals and mint vocals we've
[43:09] had about 40 years of theology preached
[43:11] around the message it's time that we
[43:15] find out what was to follow the seal hey
[43:19] man after the token message he preaches
[43:22] a sermon desperation and that evening he
[43:25] refers back to his morning sermon on the
[43:27] token and he refers it as a capping off
[43:31] time now he said this morning revert to
[43:36] the otoki in' he where he where he gives
[43:38] us a message the message is to pry the
[43:40] token get to Holy Ghost in other words
[43:43] the message this morning would to me was
[43:46] a highlights message of my entire
[43:49] ministry this is our important to see
[43:54] highlight of my entire ministry a
[43:59] highlight message
[44:01] of my entire ministry Sunday I'll tell
[44:05] you how it come about and I know that
[44:07] everything is worked for months and
[44:10] months and months up to that one message
[44:12] moving up to come to that place
[44:15] this was the Capon of time other men you
[44:20] see and any again he says I believe with
[44:25] all the messages that I ever brought
[44:27] that absolute was ordained of God
[44:30] outside of Courts irregular Commission
[44:32] like the seven seals and things that was
[44:34] directly the Word of God but I'm talking
[44:37] about a message to preach I believe that
[44:39] it was see the one needed to follow the
[44:43] seven seals a man now what comes after
[44:47] the seven seals what's what come after
[44:49] the seven seals you're 19 other people
[44:51] United science red flashing light it in
[44:54] the last day sign of women getting
[44:56] prettier men what they would do all
[44:58] these signs of the Holy Spirit leading
[45:01] up and then come right back here to the
[45:05] capping off of all of those messages
[45:07] since the seven seals it's kept often
[45:10] this one thing the token that we're dead
[45:17] that we are all right she just check
[45:19] ourselves and see that we're in the pain
[45:22] hey man check yourself make sure you're
[45:26] in the faith a man this was an exodus
[45:29] hour and this is the one that's needed
[45:32] to follow the seals and the token
[45:35] message brother branham on this it was a
[45:38] message that God ordered brother branham
[45:42] can you imagine this is not william
[45:44] branham stops he's out in the woods and
[45:46] God orders him I mean just like God
[45:50] ordered Moses tell him take a lamb
[45:55] without blemish and told him the whole
[45:58] process of it what to do it was God's
[46:01] orders
[46:02] not Moses message it was God's message
[46:06] and God was lived was given a message to
[46:10] this endtime people and he said land
[46:12] allows a message on the requirement of
[46:17] the Holy Ghost so and you must be under
[46:20] the atonement of the blood and that not
[46:23] only must you have it it must be applied
[46:27] hey man now we live in the Indus and the
[46:32] wrath is about to strike and I'm reading
[46:35] this quote again on purpose God is
[46:38] requiring a token that you yourself have
[46:42] received this token the Holy Ghost and
[46:45] it's the only way in the only sign that
[46:49] God will ever pass because it is a
[46:51] little life of Jesus Christ return back
[46:55] to the believer so this is the time of
[46:58] action I mean believes when I our vats
[47:02] and when we're to be the book of Acts
[47:04] church where the life of Christ the Holy
[47:09] Ghost is an action living out of the
[47:13] people are you hear me yeah you know I
[47:16] get it the book of Acts had its troubles
[47:18] it has trials and those of Paul called
[47:22] folks brethren but that's not what's
[47:25] being restored we already had folks
[47:28] reading in troubles and trials and
[47:30] troubles in the church but what is
[47:32] restored
[47:33] is the acts of the Holy Spirit in the
[47:36] church that the Holy Ghost is an action
[47:40] in the people that's what the book of
[47:43] Acts is about the Holy Ghost in action
[47:46] in your everyday life and healing the
[47:50] sick
[47:51] and casting out Devils in every way the
[47:54] Holy Spirit in action on your job in
[47:58] your home in your marriage everywhere
[48:00] that you look the Holy Ghost is in
[48:03] action are you with me Amen that's what
[48:06] it is then that's what is being restored
[48:08] is the Holy Ghost in action
[48:11] remember it's not to access the Apostles
[48:13] is he acts of the Holy Spirit in the
[48:16] Apostles they're right so the church is
[48:20] to be Jesus Christ in action upon the
[48:24] earth and then because I live you sell
[48:27] him also and my life will be in you the
[48:30] works that I do say you do also the
[48:32] church has to get to that place a man
[48:36] and he said he promised he would do it
[48:38] and it will it's got to come that way
[48:41] hey man I believe that's what God's
[48:43] laying it on my heart so heavy a man we
[48:46] must be crushed an accent the Holy
[48:50] Spirit at work living in the people come
[48:54] on now hey man you don't know I'm not
[48:57] trying to get you to jump or dance or
[48:59] Honor speak in tongues although that
[49:02] wouldn't hurt any of you man I mean if I
[49:06] see if I see a demon take over a person
[49:09] and speak and and talk and say things
[49:13] what about the Holy Spirit get a hold of
[49:16] your tongue speak in another language
[49:20] hey man oh my dissing but it's the Holy
[49:24] Ghost in action that's what you saw was
[49:27] a hundred and twenty influenced whose
[49:30] last vessel still
[49:37] that lacks demonstrating Christ that
[49:41] they were have to say these men abetment
[49:43] Jesus hey man now how can I overcome
[49:52] brother branham talks about the church
[49:55] maybe should be taking a little step
[49:58] higher at this time and he said I want
[50:02] to bring to the church something that
[50:03] you should know and he's looking forward
[50:06] he's looking toward the token the token
[50:09] the Holy Ghost something more than
[50:13] believing the message now this is a step
[50:20] height then believe in the message it's
[50:27] the Holy Ghost and it's a higher step
[50:31] than just believe it have you received
[50:34] the Holy Ghost since you believe after
[50:38] they believe they were sealed with the
[50:41] Holy Spirit of prize are you with me now
[50:43] so now while brother Branham is hunting
[50:47] he's troubled about his church and he's
[50:50] seeing Christians in the church living a
[50:53] life that wasn't worthy of the gospel
[50:55] I'm not now now wait a minute he's he's
[50:58] told you some of the things he's
[51:00] preached he's preaching about the

[51:27] here because of death angel his death
[51:29] calls coming in with unbridled lust and
[51:34] mind demonstrating itself with Hollywood

[52:35] sees the church needs though they got
[52:37] this superior revelation and
[52:39] intellectual learning are you in me and

[56:38] up to some by some as a senior preacher
[56:40] or elder in this message been preaching
[56:44] almost fifty years and the cries of
[56:48] pastors come to me as people leave the
[56:52] message deacons trustees some leaders
[56:58] people who a few years ago seemed solid
[57:02] in the faith and stood there for years
[57:05] live like pillars in the church but now
[57:09] rejecting the truth and living in sordid
[57:12] sinful conditions we sit in the prayer
[57:17] lines people confess in lust porn
[57:21] addiction
[57:22] grown men women young people you know
[57:28] with depression and fear anxiety suicide
[57:33] torn apart families
[57:35] Rek homes adulteries exposed and
[57:41] fornication discovered among the young
[57:44] people in pardon game addiction is led
[57:48] to demo possession and the sin of every
[57:51] kind that's coming to the church are you
[57:56] with me and then among the church are
[57:58] those who've never come over come with
[58:00] habits that can never learn the basics a
[58:05] man just watch your face just be clean
[58:09] let this token be shown on your body and
[58:12] your hair in your dress on your face
[58:18] come on now a man can never learn the
[58:22] basics of attending church paying ties
[58:26] just doing the basics but there's a
[58:29] difference and and lukewarmness
[58:32] how predestinated oh yeah we believe
[58:36] we're predestinated yes we do we believe
[58:39] God's going to pick us up in the rapture
[58:41] and clean us up without any effort or
[58:43] desire on our part cuz we're
[58:47] predestinated we'll be there that ain't
[58:49] predestination I'll tell you what if
[58:52] your predestinated you'll have a hunger
[58:54] for God and insatiable desire for the
[58:58] word I'm logging in your heart for God
[59:00] that really will show your
[59:02] predestination man it'll show in that
[59:06] even when you try to quit you can't quit
[59:09] [Applause]
[59:11] because your predestinated see slanted
[59:16] for garden loudly for god why did you do

[59:25] branham called Dodie it's not a word try
[59:29] to look it up in the dictionary yourself

[59:33] the word dote being extremely old and
[59:37] weak when a person gets their way
[59:40] they're too old or too weak to care this
[59:46] is why brother Brad was telling us and
[59:47] he cares do you care have you come to a
[59:50] place you don't care

[1:00:12] out some sons some life hey man don't
[1:00:17] take everything on this on the medicine
[1:00:18] shelf tonight just take your portion are
[1:00:21] you with me
[1:00:22] I mean you your old timers ought to be
[1:00:26] saying yes brother Tim thank you for
[1:00:31] preaching all deaths man we want to see
[1:00:34] the Holy Spirit in our church you know
[1:00:36] young people in our life we want to see
[1:00:40] people who fight for God
[1:00:42] hey man he said I was crossing a lot the
[1:00:46] other day now he's out hunting this loud
[1:00:48] can overcome where he's studying I'm
[1:00:50] studying my people I'm crossing the log
[1:00:53] the other day over a curve was down a
[1:00:56] wash what's called a hollow I jumped on
[1:00:58] this old log and on the outside it
[1:01:00] looked good and it looked like a big old
[1:01:02] beach slaw but when I jumped on it or a
[1:01:05] great big piece of it fell off it was
[1:01:08] real rotten in duty and I said that's
[1:01:11] what we Christians are becoming now he's
[1:01:13] thinking of his church this is a way my
[1:01:16] church is becoming people in my church
[1:01:19] people have heard the seals
[1:01:21] people have seen the son of man that
[1:01:24] display yourself a man and I any said
[1:01:28] that's what we Christians are becoming
[1:01:30] they're dead in sin and trespasses so
[1:01:33] long till they become Dougy they can
[1:01:37] hold no weight at all they don't know
[1:01:39] what overcoming means and that's it
[1:01:42] people just live with their problems
[1:01:44] live with their addictions live with
[1:01:48] their temper come on I mean they they
[1:01:52] can't hold our way at all they can't
[1:01:53] don't know what overcoming means and I
[1:01:56] begin to think of this text overcome
[1:01:58] keep life in you overcome Keith like in
[1:02:06] you how am I gonna overcome keep the
[1:02:09] light keep the light don't lose the
[1:02:13] light hey man
[1:02:16] and he said when the light went out
[1:02:18] speaking of the tree that's what brought
[1:02:20] that log into that condition and it made
[1:02:23] it worse than ever when it laid in the
[1:02:26] branch where the water was a branch is a
[1:02:29] creek and he says it made it worse than
[1:02:32] ever it is laying in the branch or the
[1:02:35] water he's seeing he's seen life is
[1:02:39] going out of the church's life is going
[1:02:42] out of the homes oh you know you'd be
[1:02:45] screaming amen if I was calling
[1:02:47] denominational names hey man if I was
[1:02:51] saying Baptist life is one out of their
[1:02:54] churches very bad brother damn that's
[1:02:55] right man the Methodist life has went
[1:02:59] out of them that's why there's gay
[1:03:01] marriages and gay haters but gays and I
[1:03:04] prepare some of every kind a man in the
[1:03:12] leadership of churches to whether
[1:03:14] falling away in that back inch and and
[1:03:17] worse than ever are you with me life is
[1:03:21] going either churches and the homes and
[1:03:24] individuals and it causes the wetness of
[1:03:27] Treach members dead in sins and tress
[1:03:30] Bassets a mountain and he said and when
[1:03:33] you take a Christian that's supposed to
[1:03:36] be a Christian and let the life of God
[1:03:39] go from him the experience
[1:03:41] oh the experience let the life the
[1:03:45] experience the joy of serving Christ and
[1:03:48] a living in a church for sex is going on
[1:03:52] here ah Tain's twice as quick right
[1:03:54] living right under so if we're trying to
[1:03:59] follow the message of the hour man is is
[1:04:05] he here he's talking to us now if we're
[1:04:08] trying to follow the message of the hour
[1:04:10] we should live constantly in the life of
[1:04:15] Christ because if you don't you lay
[1:04:18] around and you know that these things
[1:04:20] are supposed to do and don't do it the
[1:04:22] Bible said he that North to do good and
[1:04:24] do it to not to him it is sin and you
[1:04:27] just become Doody and rotten when you're
[1:04:30] separated from the life of God so strive
[1:04:34] strive with all that's in you to stay in
[1:04:39] the life of Christ that you'd be
[1:04:42] preparing I don't want to be one he
[1:04:47] finds a fig tree who has no fruit they
[1:04:50] get cursed man I want to be one that he
[1:04:54] finds life in frilled in the Holy Ghost
[1:04:57] moving in that the way you feel tonight
[1:05:01] and there's a follower the message we
[1:05:03] must strive with everything within us
[1:05:06] keep that life man in the church we want
[1:05:10] to keep that life we don't want to lose
[1:05:13] the spirit we're gonna lose the
[1:05:16] anointing man we don't want to lose the
[1:05:19] Welkin move that welcomed me not the
[1:05:21] Holy Ghost now to be an overcomer of
[1:05:25] course you've got to be two you've got
[1:05:28] to have something overcome and we're
[1:05:30] here in Laodicea you surely got things
[1:05:33] to overcome lukewarmness is one of the
[1:05:36] big ones complacency and not caring
[1:05:40] indifference it's a grandest of all
[1:05:43] Church ages but yet you know because it
[1:05:46] is the ending of time and the blending
[1:05:48] of eternity but it's also also the
[1:05:51] greatest sinful age it's a great age the
[1:05:55] seventh angel preached in this age man
[1:05:59] the message came in this age a man to
[1:06:02] live to see an age receive red lights
[1:06:05] until seven
[1:06:06] he received Lu 1730 Malachi 4:5 I my
[1:06:14] revelation 6 in the open and other seals
[1:06:17] it was all done right here in this way o
[1:06:20] to CMAs so it's a grand age because it's
[1:06:25] the ending of time and the blending of
[1:06:26] eternity we're getting ready for an
[1:06:29] exodus somebody with me but he said yet
[1:06:34] it's the greatest sinful age more sin in
[1:06:37] this age than ever is been and the
[1:06:40] powers of Satan many times harder to
[1:06:43] fight against and it was in any other
[1:06:46] age in that truth don't we find that
[1:06:49] with our young people it's even harder
[1:06:51] in their generation than it was our
[1:06:53] generation but ever ever ever generation
[1:06:57] that passes by gets wicked or an even
[1:06:59] more evil and Satan comes with another
[1:07:02] device another way to fight his way out
[1:07:04] the only thing going to keep him out is
[1:07:09] the Holy Ghost
[1:07:13] otherwise that things who will pay the
[1:07:15] way in and he'll be using your body and
[1:07:19] speaking through your life using your
[1:07:23] tongue
[1:07:24] dwelling in your body and you're either
[1:07:28] gonna be the temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:30] you're gonna become the the body Satan
[1:07:33] dwells in because there's two markings
[1:07:36] going on a marking of God the seal of
[1:07:40] the Holy Ghost or the marking of the
[1:07:42] Beast
[1:07:44] so you think I'll brother to him listen
[1:07:47] when I see message girls that can just
[1:07:50] brazenly put on I believe in pro-choice
[1:07:53] sub women's rights you know what
[1:07:57] that's an anointing of the depth that's
[1:08:01] a demon possession that possess their
[1:08:04] thoughts gotta hold in their life man we
[1:08:09] we can't believe in women's rights to
[1:08:11] kill their babies they have a right and
[1:08:13] they have a choice and that choice was
[1:08:15] when they got conceived when they when
[1:08:17] they made that wrong move that was the
[1:08:19] choice man now now then it's not a
[1:08:24] choice it's a life look like that would
[1:08:28] be easy to understand don't it come on
[1:08:32] look like it'd be easy to understand on
[1:08:34] it but of course then she believes is
[1:08:37] pressing upon in every way that you can
[1:08:40] imagine listen back there in the early
[1:08:42] ages a Christian for the profession
[1:08:44] however in a church belonging to Christ
[1:08:47] could be beheaded or killed put out of
[1:08:50] his misery go to meet God quickly but
[1:08:53] the enemy has come in in the name of the
[1:08:56] church and it's so deceiving this is the
[1:09:00] great age of deception when Christ said
[1:09:03] so the two spirits would be so close in
[1:09:06] the last day till he to see the very
[1:09:09] elected if it was possible remember
[1:09:11] Christ spoke of an elected people for
[1:09:13] the last day and it would deceive the
[1:09:15] very elect it if it were possible so
[1:09:18] close and the people Oh hear me now hear
[1:09:23] what brother Brandon Sampson how can
[1:09:24] over
[1:09:25] the people live they can live a clean
[1:09:28] holy life not be sinful adulterers
[1:09:32] drinkers liars gamblers they can live
[1:09:35] above that and still not with it because
[1:09:43] you can be anti-abortion and anti you
[1:09:47] know perversion and hand-tied oh I
[1:09:50] believe the word either that's it and me
[1:09:52] you know you can even come to church and
[1:09:54] you miss that life this is a age he said
[1:10:04] of the personal life this is what's
[1:10:09] required personal life of Christ now you
[1:10:18] see we've come down through
[1:10:20] justification sanctification baptisms
[1:10:24] and anointings of his spirit but this is
[1:10:27] the age of the personal life the
[1:10:31] Passover requires not simply us
[1:10:34] accepting the lamp nor just holding its
[1:10:37] blood in the basin nor waving our high
[1:10:40] CIPA or hyssop of faith but it said but
[1:10:43] they're plying of the blood to all three
[1:10:45] places of entrance the body the spirit
[1:10:49] and the soul another sermon brother
[1:10:51] branham preaches is the indictment and
[1:10:54] the indictment is a sermon about the
[1:10:58] rejection of Christ and the refusal to
[1:11:01] come under the blood and anybody who
[1:11:06] denies the blood man the intercessory of
[1:11:10] Christ is under the indictment in the
[1:11:17] nightma brother Brennan said why did
[1:11:19] they say all men should worship at
[1:11:20] Jerusalem but there's only one place
[1:11:23] that God will fellowship with man and
[1:11:25] that's under the blood of the sacrifice
[1:11:28] and the blood of the sacrifice today is
[1:11:31] the Holy Ghost all in one place he will
[1:11:33] mean Oh
[1:11:34] one thing that we have in common the
[1:11:36] holy ghost hey man
[1:11:40] God will never meet with man nowhere
[1:11:43] else but under the bud under the Holy
[1:11:46] Ghost when you turn down the blood down
[1:11:49] when your tongue the Holy Ghost down
[1:11:50] your meeting place with God has been
[1:11:53] taken away God made his first decision
[1:11:56] and the Garden of Eden that man will
[1:11:58] worship Him are under only worship Him
[1:12:01] under the blood of the sacrifice and
[1:12:03] that's the only place that God met with
[1:12:06] man then and it's the only place that
[1:12:09] God ever did meet with man and that's
[1:12:11] the only place he meets this man today
[1:12:13] is under the shed blood of the sacrifice
[1:12:16] a man see I don't care if you're
[1:12:19] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian if you
[1:12:23] know if you can and let me just add in
[1:12:26] their message believers if you can just
[1:12:28] forget your differences Roman Catholic
[1:12:31] whatever it might be come under the shed
[1:12:33] blood God will meet both of us there
[1:12:36] that's where we can all meet and
[1:12:38] fellowship on the same grounds but
[1:12:41] otherwise he will not meet you because
[1:12:43] you're Methodists he will not meet you
[1:12:46] just because you're Pentecostal could I
[1:12:49] add in there he will not meet you just
[1:12:51] cause you go to message Church he will
[1:12:54] meet you under one condition
[1:12:56] that's under the shed blood what your
[1:12:59] sins of men confess and expound in his
[1:13:02] presence by the blood and the blood is
[1:13:05] always before and therefore he can only
[1:13:07] see you through that set blood and
[1:13:10] you're white as snow see you confess
[1:13:12] your sin otherwise you're not there you
[1:13:15] can't fellowship and that's the reason
[1:13:18] you don't see things happening in the
[1:13:20] churches they confess they believe the
[1:13:24] blood but they reject the very plan to
[1:13:27] get to the blood the word oh now we just
[1:13:31] have an intellectual jump off boards
[1:13:33] Easter it's the word brother Jim that's
[1:13:35] the plan to get to the blood is the word
[1:13:37] we got out the
[1:13:38] the word the word I'll get to that in a
[1:13:41] minute we'll find out what word hey man
[1:13:45] there's only way God will honor that
[1:13:47] word you'll never honor that wouldn't
[1:13:50] come sama Roman Catholic I'll demand
[1:13:52] this to be done you can't do it
[1:13:54] Methodist Baptist Pentecostal you can't
[1:13:56] do it now and then just let me see we're
[1:14:01] in a church where we see things
[1:14:03] happening hallelujah amen we see the
[1:14:08] miraculous taking place healings
[1:14:11] miracles Devils cast out a man even when
[1:14:15] people are saying that's casting out
[1:14:17] Devils are you with me a man and then we
[1:14:21] see it happen but we want to see it
[1:14:23] happen
[1:14:24] how they would say that the season I'm
[1:14:27] happy then it's happening I want to see
[1:14:32] I want to see that book of Acts the Holy
[1:14:36] Spirit
[1:14:38] [Applause]
[1:14:54] just in the preachers but in I saw
[1:14:59] brother Branham says this in perfect
[1:15:02] faith this is another sermon preached
[1:15:05] after the seers seals that the token
[1:15:08] message caps off perfect faith you
[1:15:10] wonder how you're going to have perfect
[1:15:12] faith same way for the baptism of the
[1:15:15] Holy Ghost that gives you a perfect
[1:15:18] faith that perfects your faith that's
[1:15:20] where your faith has been made perfect
[1:15:24] man you believe you God you believe he
[1:15:27] was your Savior you believe it you
[1:15:28] believed in the Holy Ghost but where
[1:15:30] your faith is made perfect is when you
[1:15:32] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:35] that makes your faith believe in God is
[1:15:39] Savior perfect now faith is for based on
[1:15:45] forgiveness then as we said this morning
[1:15:48] trying to get the church into the place
[1:15:51] where we can really see apostolic times
[1:15:55] moving among us here so the purpose for
[1:15:57] all of these messages just get the
[1:16:00] church to the place to see apostolic
[1:16:02] times moving among us that's what we all
[1:16:05] hunger and it's just laying right at the
[1:16:08] door and I want to say where that man
[1:16:13] went right at that door are you with me
[1:16:15] man we see it he said probably want to
[1:16:18] see more of it we wanted such a flow
[1:16:22] than it would be I help to us
[1:16:24] us to flow out to others but you know
[1:16:28] today that's why some churches can plot
[1:16:31] along for years and years and years
[1:16:33] without a convert yeah without a convert
[1:16:40] no so Saint let succinctly you know why
[1:16:45] the bloody thing
[1:16:49] you think I'm joking but there's no I'll
[1:16:52] I just tell you know there are churches
[1:16:54] that are out there that have sat there
[1:16:56] for 40 years and not had one person
[1:16:59] saved except they married somebody in
[1:17:02] the church and then they got baptized is
[1:17:10] that a book of Acts Church then casting
[1:17:13] out Devils come on now brother bragging
[1:17:18] said that's why that's the reason you
[1:17:21] don't see things happening in the
[1:17:23] churches they confessed they believe the
[1:17:26] blood but they reject the very plan that
[1:17:30] give to the blood the work now the blood
[1:17:36] is the Holy Ghost a man they confess
[1:17:41] they believe in the Holy Ghost but they
[1:17:44] reject the very plan that get to the
[1:17:46] blood the Holy Ghost
[1:17:48] so my with me now so what is the word
[1:17:52] that is the plan to get to the blood
[1:17:57] acts 2:38
[1:17:59] oh man that's the word needed to get to
[1:18:05] the blood for the blood is the baptism
[1:18:08] of the Holy Ghost repent from your sins
[1:18:21] oh brother Jim pray for me get out that
[1:18:24] I'll try I'm a dad to Sam I'll do your
[1:18:28] death the bacons dad through your ideas
[1:18:33] are dead
[1:18:34] dear sons are dead and be baptized in
[1:18:38] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:18:40] remission of sin and you shall receive
[1:18:42] the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:18:45] plan to get to the blood it's just that
[1:18:51] simple the word now personal experience
[1:19:00] with God brother Brendan said that's
[1:19:02] what the church needs tonight is just
[1:19:05] stop studying so much theology and get
[1:19:08] down to the altar and pray until a
[1:19:11] personal experience burns down into the
[1:19:13] human heart and burns out all the
[1:19:15] dullness and gives a new vision hey man
[1:19:20] an indictment you must come under the
[1:19:23] blood
[1:19:23] you must come under the Holy Ghost it's
[1:19:26] the place - the only place that God will
[1:19:28] meet is under that Holy Spirit of God
[1:19:31] that's the only place hey man but Holy
[1:19:35] Ghost blood Holy Ghost you get it
[1:19:40] hey man what'd we say you know the blood
[1:19:42] of Christ we're talking about the Spirit
[1:19:44] of Christ the life of the blood I'm
[1:19:48] talking about the the fluid that fell
[1:19:50] down from his favorite um about the life
[1:19:52] that came out of him the Holy Spirit
[1:19:56] when you're born of that when you're
[1:19:59] bored of that Holy Spirit you're born of
[1:20:01] the blood a man your child you come up
[1:20:05] to him
[1:20:06] you're as possession a mad that's why
[1:20:12] many times you know when dealing with
[1:20:14] people and especially sometimes even
[1:20:16] those that are demon possesses it accept
[1:20:19] Christ take him into your heart right
[1:20:21] now ask him to come sit on that throne
[1:20:24] cuz we can get Jesus on the throne he
[1:20:27] did then you become his property
[1:20:30] and then he fights for you then the
[1:20:33] battles over when he goes to fight for
[1:20:36] you remember his property man you get
[1:20:40] the Holy Ghost you're his property
[1:20:44] [Applause]
[1:20:44] [Music]
[1:20:46] [Applause]
[1:20:58] nobody better lay hands on this property
[1:21:02] devil get back death angel move back hey
[1:21:07] man you must come under the blood and
[1:21:10] indictment he said the only way you can
[1:21:12] do that it's come under the mercies of
[1:21:14] God Oh what are we doing now and there's
[1:21:16] no more mercy you've got to come under
[1:21:17] the mercies of God through His grace is
[1:21:20] to come through this shed blood of Jesus
[1:21:22] Christ saying Lord I claim the promise
[1:21:25] and then if you're really under that
[1:21:28] blood God is obligated to that word hey
[1:21:33] man first you've got to be under that
[1:21:34] blood you see it now no wonder they
[1:21:37] can't believe in miracles no wonder you
[1:21:39] can't believe in the supernatural
[1:21:41] no wonder they condemned it the same
[1:21:43] reason they condemned it back there is
[1:21:45] the same reason they can dim it today
[1:21:47] they're guilty as guilty can be because
[1:21:49] it's under only under the said blood and
[1:21:52] those who would dare some little brother
[1:21:55] who dares under humility to take God in
[1:21:58] His Word and walk out there confess his
[1:22:00] sin forget all these dumpers and things
[1:22:03] instead they're under the blood and
[1:22:04] believe it they want to call him a
[1:22:06] fanatic a man they want to class him as
[1:22:09] we would say it's not a good word to use
[1:22:11] in the pulpit but if so you'll
[1:22:12] understand he's an oddball notice we
[1:22:17] find that only under the blood that God
[1:22:19] will meet a worshiper so the meta
[1:22:21] Jerusalem and Christ is God's provided
[1:22:24] Lamb of sacrifice and today there's only
[1:22:27] one place God will meet man and that's
[1:22:31] under this shed of blood under the blood
[1:22:33] of Jesus Christ anywhere else it is
[1:22:35] condemned God will
[1:22:37] never here and ma'am he said you can do
[1:22:42] all kinds of emotions see on that spirit
[1:22:45] run all kinds of ISM and Shake and jump
[1:22:49] and blood and fire and smoke and
[1:22:52] everything else but as long as that life
[1:22:55] isn't compared with the word and God
[1:22:58] surely identifying that life then
[1:23:01] there's no need of trying it because
[1:23:03] you're out
[1:23:04] God will never meet it til it comes
[1:23:06] under the care of the blood Oh
[1:23:09] hallelujah
[1:23:11] hey man if you get your vices under the
[1:23:14] care of the blood and then you get the
[1:23:18] things that your eyes are looking at all
[1:23:20] under the care of that blood and man
[1:23:22] what is the blood today they meant
[1:23:25] certainly it's not the body fluids that
[1:23:27] ran down the cross no a man is the life
[1:23:31] of the but the Holy Ghost and man the
[1:23:35] Holy Ghost is the blood and that's how
[1:23:37] the church is the blood by the Spirit is
[1:23:40] to be born of the Spirit you see that is
[1:23:43] not just that is not just a slogan the
[1:23:47] Churches of blood by the spirit huh we
[1:23:50] are how did we come the mud by the Holy
[1:23:52] Ghost
[1:23:53] again by the baptism of the Spirit not
[1:23:58] just a cliche I'm an ism there's a
[1:24:01] meaning that the brother of God said
[1:24:04] you're the blood by the spirit a man by
[1:24:08] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you become
[1:24:10] what's in that blood you are the blood
[1:24:13] born of the blood without the blood
[1:24:17] there's no connection that is why they
[1:24:20] can't manifest the word of the Covenant
[1:24:22] because there's no blood connection to
[1:24:24] this covenant you see the promises of
[1:24:26] this word brother Brennan said in the
[1:24:29] token worship him and show his so forth
[1:24:32] his promise power the God's blood bound
[1:24:36] took and bound covenant people has the
[1:24:40] Spirit of Jesus Christ in here that he
[1:24:42] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:24:44] shall he do also display and
[1:24:47] cabinet you see we're not just talking
[1:24:50] about the message we are displaying the
[1:24:53] message are you with me
[1:24:56] displaying it everywhere that we
[1:24:58] everybody passing by the children in the
[1:25:01] home see the token the wife sees the
[1:25:04] token the husband sees the token
[1:25:07] everybody the church sees the token of
[1:25:10] your job they see the token everywhere
[1:25:12] they see the black at the life of Christ
[1:25:16] is on display now again shows that Jesus
[1:25:22] Christ is in here there's only one
[1:25:25] provided place by God by God for
[1:25:27] anything this again is in 1963 of just
[1:25:32] before the token but it's not in
[1:25:34] jeffersonville but he says and any
[1:25:36] religion today that hasn't got the blood
[1:25:38] life of Jesus Christ behind it the death
[1:25:41] angel is on it right death angel
[1:25:45] separated from God yes indeedy it Chabad
[1:25:48] is wrote over every bit of that that
[1:25:51] event that hasn't got the blood you
[1:25:55] won't you say well I'm glad the blood
[1:25:57] now listen if it hasn't taken effect a
[1:26:02] man if the blood hasn't they in effect
[1:26:05] and you see it in your life as a
[1:26:08] consecrated child of God with what Jesus
[1:26:12] said would take place and be careful you
[1:26:14] might have something else besides the
[1:26:17] mud you might have a little injection of
[1:26:21] theology in there or some little
[1:26:23] objective some sensations in that look
[1:26:27] both sides come on both sides of the
[1:26:31] door sensation and the and theology head
[1:26:34] knowledge and theology you say I
[1:26:37] quivered I shook I danced I do this be
[1:26:40] careful
[1:26:40] now listen Church this is why the church
[1:26:44] will go through the tribulation now hear
[1:26:48] me now the church will go through the
[1:26:51] tribulation but not the bride
[1:26:54] hey ma'am you know why it's because
[1:26:58] because that then again then they will
[1:27:02] go through the tribulation cuz they
[1:27:04] think they are under now they have the
[1:27:14] lamb they have the bow they have the
[1:27:16] faith but it's not displayed it hasn't
[1:27:20] been applied isn't there or maybe it's
[1:27:24] just a blight in one place
[1:27:26] and there's still another entrance in
[1:27:30] there's still another area in that Satan
[1:27:34] can the Death Angel can come in there's
[1:27:35] anybody listening to me a man then you
[1:27:38] see they think you're under the blood
[1:27:40] because of justification by a confession
[1:27:43] of faith I believe a man but let me tell
[1:27:47] your friends it's got to be something
[1:27:49] more than that and then that it's got to
[1:27:52] be that the life of the lamb has come
[1:27:55] back above you as a believer so that you
[1:27:59] have the nature of the land see the Old
[1:28:03] Testament couldn't do that they can slay
[1:28:05] the lamb but the nature couldn't come
[1:28:07] back so all they can have right there is
[1:28:09] the physical elements of the blood but
[1:28:12] you have the nature of Christ must be on
[1:28:16] your body your spirit and your soul
[1:28:22] hey ma'am it's got to be able with the
[1:28:25] nature the nature now because this blood
[1:28:33] has the power to change the nature
[1:28:37] remember this is where they're heavy
[1:28:39] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:28:41] lovers of God trucebreakers covenant
[1:28:44] breakers on and on and on you know why
[1:28:45] they you know they because again they
[1:28:49] deny the power so why they've become
[1:28:53] safe sinners
[1:28:55] man we were still sinners we can't help
[1:28:59] what we're doing you know I want to be
[1:29:00] good and I'm trying
[1:29:02] you know instead of watchin one hour of
[1:29:04] pornography this week I only watch 30
[1:29:07] minutes of it but you know I'm improving
[1:29:10] or I've taken a pass from it for a while
[1:29:15] and we're just me you know but God and
[1:29:19] God sees the blood the only way that
[1:29:23] blood is there is the Holy Ghost is
[1:29:25] there and if the Holy Ghost is there
[1:29:28] that nature of the Lamb will let you do
[1:29:32] those things God revealed to Abel what
[1:29:39] was acceptable sacrifice and then God
[1:29:42] showed his approval didn't he hey man
[1:29:45] he told Cain and Genesis 4:7 if thou
[1:29:48] doest well shalt thou not be accepted
[1:29:50] and if you do not well sin lies at the
[1:29:53] door so in other words he says if you
[1:29:57] come the same way that your brother did
[1:29:59] don't you know you'll be accepted if you
[1:30:04] come by the way of the blood you'll be
[1:30:06] accepted somebody help me preach now if
[1:30:11] we insist on a free day Cain's sacrifice
[1:30:16] denied the blood and offering instead I
[1:30:21] you know fruits and our theology and
[1:30:26] men's idea and beautiful sermons and
[1:30:30] lovely mysteries that are still
[1:30:33] mysteries man that's what Cain did a man
[1:30:42] he offered botany life without feeling
[1:30:46] and if we insist on the baptism of the
[1:30:51] Holy Ghost without emotion without
[1:30:53] feeling but because we will come by the
[1:30:56] way of the blood with feeling then are
[1:30:59] appealing
[1:31:02] you cannot continue to offer Cain
[1:31:06] sacrifice which is a green without blood
[1:31:13] without feeling sin crops is at the door
[1:31:20] like the Death Angel II crops is like a
[1:31:22] cat flying at you like a bat oh I know I
[1:31:27] know some of you are walking through
[1:31:29] this like a tomcat walking through
[1:31:30] molasses tonight but hey let's look at
[1:31:34] this real carefully the Holy Ghost is
[1:31:36] not theology neither is it emotion it is
[1:31:40] a life and when that light comes in you
[1:31:43] it takes charge of your emotions
[1:31:47] it also takes charge of your theology a
[1:31:50] man and man it'll take charge of your
[1:31:53] passions and mind there and he cares who
[1:31:56] you care brother madam said you you said
[1:31:59] you like a person says there I am I'm a
[1:32:01] believer I believe let the gospel light
[1:32:04] strike them brother they'll take it
[1:32:07] right now
[1:32:07] and they are so results a man certainly
[1:32:13] you not see that man anymore in pool
[1:32:16] rooms you not seem out here with a
[1:32:19] cigarette in his hand you won't see him
[1:32:22] drinking no no you won't seem flirtin
[1:32:25] with other women no no no I don't care
[1:32:27] how much they throw their female flesh
[1:32:31] before him
[1:32:32] he'll turn his head toward the skies and
[1:32:34] look toward Christ what is it
[1:32:37] it shows the remedy has taken effect
[1:32:43] again brother branham told us him there
[1:32:45] is only one way provided by God a man
[1:32:49] came to me yesterday he says I got a boy
[1:32:51] 16 brother Brennan I got a boy 12 I take
[1:32:56] them on the street these little strip
[1:32:58] teasers out there he said the boys their
[1:33:01] little males he said what can I tell
[1:33:03] them and brother Brennan said sir I
[1:33:05] don't know
[1:33:08] take them to Christ
[1:33:11] and let them get saved and filled with
[1:33:15] the Holy Ghost and they'll turn their
[1:33:17] heads to their modern strip teachers I
[1:33:23] don't know what to tell my listen I
[1:33:26] don't have any psychology to help me
[1:33:28] with I don't happiness a yeah you don't
[1:33:31] help you with your learning behavior you
[1:33:34] know don't do this and try dancing you
[1:33:37] don't try you know tie some ribbon
[1:33:38] around your head right you don't look
[1:33:40] away do this yeah I don't have a
[1:33:42] solution either then get to Jesus hard
[1:33:46] as you can
[1:33:47] amen fall in love with Jesus get filled
[1:33:50] with Jesus it'll take care of that same
[1:33:52] question they'll turn their heads to
[1:34:02] these modern strip teasers too many or
[1:34:07] grandchildren of this message we went
[1:34:11] along brother Brendan talked about the
[1:34:13] Pentecostals and their grandkids we're
[1:34:15] now here we've arrived the message just
[1:34:18] a way of life it's just a tradition
[1:34:20] they've been taught good Amish good
[1:34:24] Mennonite people who've been given
[1:34:27] strict rules of dress and behavior but
[1:34:30] are missing the life this is the rising
[1:34:35] of the Sun brother Brendan said Satan
[1:34:38] don't care how religious you are or how
[1:34:41] right you are in your doctrine if you
[1:34:43] miss that life you won't come up in it
[1:34:45] how no matter how religious I'm good how
[1:34:48] many churches you belong to her will
[1:34:50] belong to it doesn't matter one thing
[1:34:52] unless you've been born again he tells
[1:34:56] us in the message paradox
[1:34:57] he gave gives us whole illustration
[1:35:00] about this boy how he inherited as his
[1:35:03] parents Jean but but they had been
[1:35:05] converted so there wasn't nothing like
[1:35:07] their family what was Irish and the
[1:35:10] other German and one you know he
[1:35:11] described their whole characteristics of
[1:35:14] their family and and the wrong
[1:35:16] characteristics there but you're not
[1:35:18] like that
[1:35:18] cuz you've been born again now this boy
[1:35:22] the only thing
[1:35:24] he made a promise or something did
[1:35:26] something with a girl who wouldn't
[1:35:27] apologize fart and he wouldn't make it
[1:35:30] right so it was brought to brother
[1:35:32] branham and he said the father raised up
[1:35:35] and said my son went to the altar he was
[1:35:41] baptized correctly in the name of Jesus
[1:35:44] Christ and water baptism in the pool
[1:35:47] said I know that my son has come to
[1:35:52] Christ and I said that may be alright
[1:35:56] all the outward motions he might be
[1:36:01] identified as a believer with the
[1:36:03] believers but unless he's regenerated
[1:36:07] born again I'd advise a young man to
[1:36:10] never marry a woman he'll make hell on
[1:36:12] earth fart until that gentle sweet
[1:36:17] forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in I'll
[1:36:22] tell you friends how I've seen it too
[1:36:24] often men men and women making hell on
[1:36:27] earth in their home cuz the sweet loving
[1:36:31] forgiving Spirit of Christ isn't left
[1:36:34] and if you don't have it I'll tell you
[1:36:37] what you know your marriage is doomed
[1:36:39] it's just only time when the bomb will
[1:36:42] strike you'll explode then that would be
[1:36:48] a paradox in itself to take the very
[1:36:49] nature that boy that's bred between
[1:36:52] father and mother and you know you know
[1:36:54] yourself I know myself and then I
[1:36:57] inherited all kinds of things from the
[1:36:59] pricks and the Middletons and I'll tell
[1:37:03] you the cross wasn't all that good for
[1:37:06] you bragging didn't help to cross it
[1:37:09] with the winners either a man just made
[1:37:12] a bunch of other messes a man but
[1:37:15] there's one thing that's a cure for the
[1:37:17] fruit middleton problem that's the Holy
[1:37:20] Ghost
[1:37:21] oh man which makes it different from all
[1:37:25] the rest of them separated sold out
[1:37:29] consecrated by men bad the Holy Ghost oh
[1:37:32] man
[1:37:33] yep he said now it's a it'll be a
[1:37:36] paradox in himself to take the very
[1:37:38] nature of a boy that's bred between a
[1:37:41] father and mother and yet it is an
[1:37:45] Alexis somebody helped me preach now
[1:37:48] hold the word here yet
[1:37:50] it is intellectuals he is trying his
[1:37:54] best and can't do it
[1:38:03] he'll never overcome it Christ will half
[1:38:08] to over tap it
[1:38:11] see that's why these pick these these
[1:38:14] TED Talks won't work a man won't we just
[1:38:18] give them a little bit psychology and
[1:38:21] reasoning and pat him on the back and
[1:38:23] say you're all right and going to heaven
[1:38:24] the way you are you're not you're going
[1:38:27] to hell you're missing the rapture you
[1:38:31] need to find a place of repentance and
[1:38:34] come to God and die after sin sin nature
[1:38:38] is dead in your life Christ will have to
[1:38:46] overcome it let me just tell you you're
[1:38:49] dealing with a problem in your life
[1:38:50] Christ will have to overcome it listen
[1:38:57] this ain't a one two three step of a a
[1:39:01] did they say now that Daddy to cure that
[1:39:05] Danny listen they're given all kinds of
[1:39:07] treatments for sin and these treatments
[1:39:11] aren't working Christ will have to
[1:39:16] overcome it when he lets Christ in that
[1:39:18] he's already overcome then it'll be a
[1:39:21] perfect paradox when a man is born of
[1:39:24] the Spirit of God now we have great
[1:39:27] meetings today are you still with me I'm
[1:39:31] just gonna go right on up just right up
[1:39:33] to the hour so just hang tight
[1:39:35] I know it's winds tonight we are
[1:39:37] meetings with great sermons to stimulate
[1:39:41] the mind
[1:39:41] what we need is sermons that will bring
[1:39:45] about a change of nature by leading
[1:39:48] souls to repentance to do this the
[1:39:52] dynamics must connect with the mechanics
[1:39:58] and Belon Belon wouldn't compare this
[1:40:01] with two cars and he says both of them
[1:40:04] are filled with octane power which is
[1:40:07] the word but one has got fire amen and
[1:40:12] bounce back and the other desert and one
[1:40:16] will will drive one will go down the
[1:40:19] road to divine healing through
[1:40:23] overcoming power right back going back
[1:40:28] passing sex Simpson fornication and all
[1:40:32] those things are you in this is no
[1:40:35] somewhere in the next of us it's going
[1:40:41] higher it's moving out but the others
[1:40:45] Jack sitting right in this trap year
[1:40:48] after year no change
[1:40:52] don't dealing with the same old problems
[1:40:56] having to wipe off to all the dirt in
[1:40:58] the filth of the world
[1:41:00] listen gasoline represents the word and
[1:41:04] it's the truth but without the Spirit it
[1:41:06] won't move
[1:41:08] a man brother I'll tell you I tell you
[1:41:12] we're sitting in a good place
[1:41:15] I said we're sitting in a good place
[1:41:18] the reason why we're sitting in the good
[1:41:21] places you've been filled up and man you
[1:41:24] got 10,000 power octane in your tank
[1:41:27] there's more than a tiger in your tank
[1:41:31] hey man don't so word of god that's been
[1:41:33] put in your tape a man has been put in
[1:41:36] their service after service it's the
[1:41:54] time doesn't read and save we put too
[1:41:56] much stress on the mechanics nothing on
[1:41:59] the dynamics so I'll tell you then with
[1:42:02] time we put some stress power to go with
[1:42:14] the word that we have received and let
[1:42:16] the spark of the Holy Ghost begin to get
[1:42:19] that work that has been hid in your
[1:42:21] heart
[1:42:23] amen oh and then it'll start moving for
[1:42:27] it the bride it was the groom hit on 16
[1:42:29] cylinders so will the bride a man oh yes
[1:42:34] he'll give a charge of his dynamics
[1:42:36] trying to hurry here because you see the
[1:42:39] Holy Ghost is a very symbol that you
[1:42:42] have been connected with your sacrifice
[1:42:45] and there's a problem today you see in
[1:42:48] the connection that's why there's no
[1:42:50] firepower there you've got to be
[1:42:52] connected with the Holy Ghost you got
[1:42:54] the word but connect it with the Holy
[1:42:57] Ghost hey man this is what's needed in
[1:43:00] our church and message churches across
[1:43:02] the country they meant connect it with
[1:43:05] the Holy Ghost
[1:43:06] we're right here to three minutes hours
[1:43:09] so time to get connected I'm out with
[1:43:12] your sacrifice that's right now listen
[1:43:15] if there's no sacrifice in heaven then
[1:43:18] there's no reason to be connected this
[1:43:20] makes them the token the Holy Ghost null
[1:43:23] and void if there's no one there if
[1:43:25] there's no one has the intercessor if
[1:43:27] there's no one is the mediator this
[1:43:30] outpouring of the Spirit is released
[1:43:32] from the blood of God can I bring you a
[1:43:35] quotation from the church age book the
[1:43:37] original outpouring of Pentecost
[1:43:39] which at Porton came direct from Jesus
[1:43:43] on the mercy seat isn't doing his chance
[1:43:48] through all the seven ages showing that
[1:43:52] perfectly that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:43:54] yesterday today and forever that never
[1:43:57] change in God in his essence and his
[1:43:59] ways hallelujah so when you get
[1:44:02] connected to your sacrifice a man here
[1:44:05] comes an outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:07] which comes direct from Jesus hoping the
[1:44:10] Mercy's here amen and if you're not
[1:44:12] connected to the mercy seat of Jesus
[1:44:15] come on
[1:44:16] well people were to connect it up mercy
[1:44:18] seat on the earth be connected to them
[1:44:20] we're the one with mercy God won't you
[1:44:22] connected to him through the Holy Ghost
[1:44:25] through the power of God that is the
[1:44:42] surprise dynamics in the church Jesus
[1:44:46] Christ yesterday
[1:44:50] [Applause]
[1:45:00] under that blood remember when that's
[1:45:03] until that sealed is placed upon you
[1:45:06] brother Brandon said you have no right
[1:45:07] to call yourself connected to your
[1:45:10] sacrifice and this is a problem today
[1:45:12] people are not connected to the
[1:45:14] sacrifice and then there's a shot
[1:45:17] somewhere and there's no dynamics to go
[1:45:21] with all these mechanics we fiddle
[1:45:24] faddle and fiddle faddle oh my friend
[1:45:27] wouldn't this prophet lift he left us a
[1:45:29] car that was running why did you mess
[1:45:31] with it and then why don't we go back to
[1:45:34] the original word in the original
[1:45:36] message and go back to original
[1:45:39] Pentecost they let him get connected
[1:45:41] again with the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[1:45:44] Ghost begin their power man
[1:45:53] notice now I'm trying to bring this down
[1:45:56] to closest remember remember they're in
[1:45:58] the end they upper room for the first
[1:46:01] forty days Jesus was with them appearing
[1:46:04] among up but then 10 days in the upper
[1:46:07] room and then afters which was seven
[1:46:09] weeks after the Passover on the fiftieth
[1:46:12] day the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:46:15] and the atonement was applied and the
[1:46:18] blood was sprinkled upon them as licks
[1:46:20] of fire began to fall upon each one of
[1:46:23] them they become connected to the
[1:46:26] sacrifice that's what's a matter in the
[1:46:29] churches today they're not connected
[1:46:31] with the sacrifice when you're connected
[1:46:34] with the sacrifices overcome in power
[1:46:36] when you're connected with the sacrifice
[1:46:38] there is healing power of deliverance
[1:46:43] there at Pentecost the true hearts drew
[1:46:46] near with full assurance of faith hearts
[1:46:48] sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[1:46:50] evil desires like the Sioux like has
[1:46:52] been stated in Hebrews 10:22 let us draw
[1:46:56] near with a true heart in full assurance
[1:46:58] of faith having our hearts sprinkled
[1:47:00] from an evil conscience hot bodies
[1:47:03] washed with pure water so you see we
[1:47:06] returned back to the original atonement
[1:47:08] but until that
[1:47:10] fire comes upon you the blood of the
[1:47:14] sacrifice has not been applied to you
[1:47:17] you must are you hear me must be
[1:47:21] connected with your lamb with your
[1:47:24] sacrifice say well we believe it well
[1:47:28] you give a superficial claim of we
[1:47:31] believe it but there's no manifestation
[1:47:33] if God is indeed with you then where are
[1:47:36] the miracles Amen God is with us I want
[1:47:40] to say it again God is with us
[1:47:42] how do I know that Devils are cast out I
[1:47:45] don't know what kind of devil souls are
[1:47:47] saved that's what I'm down that at a
[1:47:50] time is sown the same demons are cast
[1:47:52] out amen amen
[1:47:54] Devils are cast out the sick are healed
[1:47:57] everytime the sickest heal battles are
[1:47:59] cast out oh man Devils are cast out and
[1:48:02] sin is exposed and sin is remitted when
[1:48:06] Devils are cast out we're a
[1:48:12] [Applause]
[1:48:36] tonight
[1:48:41] hallelujah brother Lenin said if a man
[1:48:43] says he'd born again and tries to place
[1:48:45] these promises of Christ in this last
[1:48:48] day to some other age making him Christ
[1:48:50] yesterday but not today then that man or
[1:48:54] that person has been under the delusion
[1:48:55] of Satan and if that man said he
[1:48:58] believes that many oh we believe in
[1:49:00] miracles
[1:49:01] we believe in casting out Devils we
[1:49:03] believe that relative but it doesn't
[1:49:05] manifest through Jesus said mark 16
[1:49:08] these signs shall follow them that
[1:49:10] believe in all the world camarades
[1:49:12] casting out Devils speaking with tongues
[1:49:14] all these manifestations the gifts that
[1:49:16] would follow that they shall nothing
[1:49:18] maybe they ought to they will and
[1:49:20] heavens and earth will pass away but if
[1:49:23] wine what ho brother we're here we're in
[1:49:29] another book of Acts
[1:49:31] Satan's Mian cast out his kingdoms
[1:49:34] coming down the blood is being applied
[1:49:37] brother Brendan said now we realize
[1:49:39] we're not st. Paul and I realize that
[1:49:42] tonight I'm not st. Paul but he still
[1:49:45] Jesus he's still God and God's no
[1:49:49] respecter person he send you pastors and
[1:49:51] evangelists and things along that you
[1:49:54] might have the same faith in the same
[1:49:55] God that st. Paul represented and then
[1:49:58] if we have the same ministry st. Paul
[1:50:00] had the same things take place in our
[1:50:02] ministry take place in that took place
[1:50:05] and st. Paul's meeting a man brother man
[1:50:09] told us again the people instead of
[1:50:11] staring this is God of this evil age
[1:50:13] sort of tearing for the baptism of the
[1:50:15] Holy Ghost they let science prove to her
[1:50:19] that the Holy Ghost was only for the
[1:50:21] disciples instead of keeping divine
[1:50:23] healing going where she where she ought
[1:50:27] to be not raising the dead and doing
[1:50:29] great miracles she's let Satan under his
[1:50:32] leadership a religious men take the Word
[1:50:34] of God and try to say it was for another
[1:50:36] age and she believed it now listen to me
[1:50:40] he preached over again starting with his
[1:50:43] church and his seed church by the word
[1:50:45] preached it out over and over and over
[1:50:48] again he became a theme in his
[1:50:50] evangelistic sermons
[1:50:51] so it was not
[1:50:52] two out there to the world though he was

[1:53:00] barren women to bring forth barren wombs
[1:53:04] of souls to give life then I called for
[1:53:08] the barren church to bring forth life it
[1:53:14] was a moving moment unison Berenice has
[1:53:18] plagued the family of Abraham and the
[1:53:21] seed of God it's always been a problem
[1:53:23] it was a problem there in the family of
[1:53:26] Abraham and even of God promised
[1:53:30] fruitfulness then God promised this
[1:53:33] church would write another book of Acts
