[23:12] when your Prophet would show up father

[23:23] fear we love you father ask that you
[23:25] just be in the whole service father

[23:34] watch the archive minister to them Lord
[23:37] God we just love you Lord we give the
[23:39] service to you each part Lord ask father
[23:42] that each song Lord wouldn't just be

[27:21] special Wednesday morning not knowing
[27:24] that any of these events were coming
[27:27] getting ready to take place L Ron said
[27:30] that he dreamed this morning this
[27:31] Wednesday morning said Andrew and myself
[27:33] was speaking in a beautiful gymnasium he
[27:36] said we were standing besides one
[27:38] another and our our people was sitting
[27:39] in the in bleacher seats and the floor
[27:42] was as it is now in our church the place
[27:45] was at capacity and he said I was
[27:47] speaking with like a mask on and Drew
[27:50] was wearing a hat like a statement hat
[27:52] he said we was going full blast I was
[27:55] brought a note and I went to to an
[27:58] office to read the note he said I
[28:00] removed my mask and coming out to speak
[28:03] with Drew a moment and he removed his
[28:06] hat and the announcement was made the
[28:09] curse is over and the place erupted he
[28:12] said I don't know what it all means but
[28:14] it was some feeling he shared it with
[28:17] brother Tim puit and brother Tim sent
[28:18] the interpretation to the dream The Mask
[28:21] represents your sickness the Hat
[28:24] represents Andrew's Declaration of Faith
[28:27] the no is a word from God the mask
[28:29] removed means the sickness is over the
[28:33] Hat removed means faith has achieved its
[28:36] Victory the announcement is the curse
[28:38] and its trial is over the place erupting
[28:41] is the shouts of Victory heard around
[28:44] the
[28:45] world I was driving on Thursday morning
[28:48] and i' taking the kids to school that
[28:51] morning and I was just praying as I was
[28:52] traveling back and I I was driving and I
[28:55] begin to think begin to think about this
[28:57] dream that brother Ron had and how the
[28:59] spirit of the Lord had came down and
[29:01] dealt with him and and I was begin to
[29:03] think about this dream and I'd really
[29:05] begin to pray about it and the Lord
[29:07] dealt with me just sweeped into the
[29:10] car and I could just hear him say say
[29:12] these
[29:13] words write sister Courtney Dexter and
[29:17] ask her if she could write a song to
[29:19] this
[29:20] dream you know if you would come to me
[29:22] and say brother Andrew dream me a dream
[29:24] you know I couldn't do that or if you
[29:26] would come to me and say brother brother
[29:27] Andrew preached me a sermon unless the
[29:29] gift begins to activate it it just
[29:31] doesn't work that way so I knew that
[29:34] when I had felt led to write sister
[29:36] Courtney to put a song to this dream I
[29:38] knew that the Lord was in it and

[57:31] are you you don't you don't understand
[57:33] that you bad report after bad report

[57:48] do me no
[57:49] harm you know he said the doctor said
[57:51] that he's got cancer in both eyes and
[57:53] they believe that it's come from the
[57:54] brain PR
[57:56] wow and he says Isaiah 53 says God is my
[58:02] healer and I believe that we ought to be
[58:04] able to stand with him
[58:08] today you know I know you've prayed for
[58:10] him for 4 years and look here we are
[58:11] four years later the prayers have
[58:14] worked don't back off

[58:19] that that brother Andrew asked his
[58:21] church consecrate
[58:23] yourselves yes and pray for him more
[58:27] fervently than you've ever prayed
[58:30] before because the devil just threw
[58:32] everything he had at
[58:34] him but when the enemy comes in like a
[58:36] flood I
[58:38] believe I believe that the word is true
[58:41] that he's going to raise up a standard
[58:43] of
[58:44] healing no harm no no harm can we pray
[58:49] this morning Heavenly Father what an
[58:51] atmosphere Lord Lord an atmosphere of
[58:54] faith and an atmosphere of believing an
[58:56] atmosphere Lord where all things are
[58:59] possible Lord I pray this morning that
[59:01] you'll move me aside
[59:04] Lord Lord completely and may you just
[59:06] speak Lord maybe it seems off of what I
[59:10] studied maybe I don't even understand
[59:11] where I'm going Lord but will you speak
[59:13] this
[59:14] morning Lord take control Lord in this
[59:17] atmosphere I know Lord God lord I know

[59:24] Ron
[59:25] Lord Lord in such a in such a battle and
[59:29] yet Lord what a soldier he's
[59:31] been Lord as they've stood there in
[59:34] faith as he's ministered the gospel Time
[59:36] After Time After
[59:37] Time I can declare unhesitatingly that
[59:40] you've used him like never
[59:43] before Lord and I see a man that has
[59:45] trusted you with his
[59:47] life and now I pray Lord that you give
[59:49] it to
[59:52] him Satan we come before for you as the
[59:55] Bride of Jesus Christ and we command you
[59:57] to take your hands off of God's
[59:59] Property not only off of brother Ron but
[1:00:02] AC of the Bride around this world the
[1:00:04] ones that you've Afflicted and that are
[1:00:06] struggling there's many even here in our
[1:00:08] own assembly our dear sister jeie
[1:00:10] battling cancer many other problems and
[1:00:13] sicknesses but it's time that you let go
[1:00:17] it's time that the house of Hell give
[1:00:19] way to the name of Jesus and we stand
[1:00:22] and speak this morning because we
[1:00:23] believe
[1:00:25] Lord and we believe that you would never
[1:00:27] fail and that your will is to heal and
[1:00:29] so we place it in your hands now father
[1:00:31] and we believe you Lord have your way
[1:00:33] now in this service we thank you that

[1:00:38] here but we thank you and when it's
[1:00:40] special and we can feel you move in the
[1:00:42] building Lord speak to every heart now I
[1:00:45] pray in Jesus name amen amen if you have
[1:00:49] your Bibles with you I'd like to ask you
[1:00:51] to turn with me to the book of gen
[1:00:55] Genesis the first chapter and we'll read
[1:00:59] the very first three verses before we
[1:01:01] turn over to Ephesians the second
[1:01:04] chapter amen ain't God
[1:01:07] good amen he sure is it's it's wonderful
[1:01:10] when when God's people come together and
[1:01:13] and begin to worship him and to feel him
[1:01:15] move into the place like he has this
[1:01:18] morning
[1:01:21] Hallelujah and it says in the beginning
[1:01:25] God created the Heaven and the Earth and
[1:01:28] the Earth was without form and void and
[1:01:31] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:01:33] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:01:36] face of the waters and God said let
[1:01:39] there be light and there was light if
[1:01:44] you'll turn also with
[1:01:45] me to Ephesians the 2
[1:01:49] chapter and we'll read the first seven
[1:01:51] verses there as
[1:01:53] well
[1:01:55] it says and you hath he quickened who
[1:01:56] were dead in trespasses and sins wherein
[1:01:59] in times past you walked according to
[1:02:01] the course of this world according to
[1:02:03] the prince of the power of the air the
[1:02:07] spirit that now worketh in the children
[1:02:09] of Disobedience among whom also we all
[1:02:12] had our conversations in times past in
[1:02:15] the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[1:02:17] desires of the Flesh and of the mind and
[1:02:19] were by Nature the children of Wrath
[1:02:22] even as others but
[1:02:26] God who is rich in
[1:02:28] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[1:02:32] loved
[1:02:33] us you know right here in this verse
[1:02:36] it's almost a parallel to verse two in
[1:02:39] Genesis you had a chaotic
[1:02:42] Earth there was chaos but God
[1:02:46] moved and then he describes our lives
[1:02:48] and we were in sin and we were in
[1:02:50] darkness and we were in shambles but God
[1:02:53] who is rich in Mercy for his great love
[1:02:57] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[1:02:59] dead in sins hath quickened us together
[1:03:01] with
[1:03:02] Christ by Grace you are saved and hath
[1:03:05] raised us up together and made us to sit
[1:03:08] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that
[1:03:12] in the ages to come he might show the
[1:03:14] exceeding Riches of his grace and his
[1:03:17] kindness towards us through qu Christ
[1:03:20] amen I pray the Lord will add His
[1:03:22] blessings to the word as you take your
[1:03:23] seats this
[1:03:26] morning what we see right
[1:03:29] here in verse
[1:03:31] two is it tells us that Satan is the
[1:03:34] prince of the power of the air in other
[1:03:37] words he rules in high places in
[1:03:41] Heavenly places and the reason he was
[1:03:43] there is because man fail and we'll get
[1:03:45] more into that later and we fail from
[1:03:47] our position it allowed Satan to move
[1:03:49] into that position and began to rule
[1:03:51] from there and therefore we no longer
[1:03:53] could attain
[1:03:55] Heavenly
[1:03:56] places so it places him there and it
[1:03:58] shows that he is there but then it comes
[1:04:01] right on down and and in verse six it
[1:04:04] says but he's raised us up together so
[1:04:07] now we've been raised up again to make
[1:04:08] us sit together where in Heavenly places
[1:04:13] so it shows our restoration right here
[1:04:16] but notice it doesn't show Satan cast
[1:04:18] down at this point so it's still a
[1:04:22] contested place even though we have a
[1:04:23] right to to go there and battle for it
[1:04:25] he's still there accusing you and
[1:04:27] telling you you don't have a right to be
[1:04:30] here we're going to get into that more
[1:04:32] as we go because we live in a time where
[1:04:35] the atmosphere all around us is very
[1:04:38] unsettled it's a very unsettled times
[1:04:41] and many times I I don't think we we
[1:04:43] appreciate the significance um and the
[1:04:45] role that atmosphere plays in our
[1:04:48] lives it it's a uh we don't recognize
[1:04:51] its importance in a good marriage
[1:04:54] uh it's importance in a good home it's
[1:04:56] importance in church and the services
[1:04:59] that that we have it's something that we
[1:05:01] should work to foster a positive
[1:05:04] atmosphere an atmosphere of Faith an
[1:05:07] atmosphere of believing an atmosphere of
[1:05:09] uplifting atmosphere is very important
[1:05:12] and it should be fostered and it should
[1:05:13] be centered on the word of God in all
[1:05:16] aspects of our
[1:05:18] life and and many times we don't we
[1:05:22] don't recognize this but it's the truth
[1:05:24] and brother brandham we'll see quotes
[1:05:26] that back this up often times what we
[1:05:28] receive or don't receive what we receive
[1:05:32] or don't receive is a direct result of
[1:05:34] the atmosphere that we operate
[1:05:37] in you'll find that positive people tend
[1:05:40] to have more positive things happen to
[1:05:42] them or at least they recognize the
[1:05:44] positive in the things that happen to
[1:05:47] them when man lives in a NE in a
[1:05:50] negative atmosphere and he's constantly
[1:05:52] living in the negative he will produce
[1:05:54] negative
[1:05:55] results it's just the way it is it's a
[1:05:58] self-fulfilling prophecy really is is
[1:06:00] what it is and you get those people that
[1:06:03] that have that eore woe as me atmosphere
[1:06:06] and that's exactly what you're going to
[1:06:08] produce in your life and the same thing
[1:06:10] goes for church if if you come to the
[1:06:12] house of God with well I guess we'll see
[1:06:15] well I guess how we'll see how this
[1:06:17] service going to go oh they're talking
[1:06:19] about blessings again but my life's in
[1:06:22] shambles oh here they go talking about
[1:06:24] the moving of the spirit again so people
[1:06:26] can run and shout and oh here they go
[1:06:29] he's got victory over the enemy well
[1:06:32] then that's what you're going to get out
[1:06:33] of every single service you're going to
[1:06:35] walk in defeated unless you change the
[1:06:37] atmosphere in which you operate you're
[1:06:39] going to walk out defeated but what I'm
[1:06:41] telling you is this morning you don't
[1:06:42] have to live in that atmosphere you have
[1:06:45] been called to be the creator of
[1:06:47] atmospheres you get to choose the
[1:06:49] atmosphere in which you live in and I
[1:06:51] say in a day which the word has been
[1:06:53] restored which the seals have been
[1:06:55] opened which God has come back once
[1:06:57] again to fellowship with God between God
[1:06:59] and man we should be living in the most
[1:07:01] happy most positive most overcoming
[1:07:04] atmosphere of anybody that's ever lived
[1:07:06] on the face of the Earth we know we're
[1:07:08] standing on the edge of a Rapture how
[1:07:10] much happier how much more positive how
[1:07:13] much more excited could we
[1:07:16] be and yet we get a lot of
[1:07:22] this we get a lot of negative
[1:07:25] ativity you come with that atmosphere
[1:07:28] and it not only affects you in a church
[1:07:31] service but in reality it hinders the
[1:07:34] entire atmosphere and it'll keep it from
[1:07:37] reaching the levels that that moment
[1:07:39] could have
[1:07:41] reached oh but brother Aaron it was a
[1:07:43] great service it sure was what could it
[1:07:45] have
[1:07:46] been where could we have gone What
[1:07:48] miracles could have taken place well
[1:07:50] we're not looking for that every C speak
[1:07:52] for yourself I am
[1:07:54] I'm looking for the exceeding abundantly
[1:07:56] every time we come together I'm not sure
[1:07:59] why you showed up this morning I didn't
[1:08:01] wake up to waste time I didn't come
[1:08:04] together to see all your smiling faces
[1:08:06] even though I do love you y'all are
[1:08:09] wonderful people but I came to see him
[1:08:11] move and when he moves there's the
[1:08:13] miraculous the sick are healed the Lost
[1:08:15] are saved the the the Justified get
[1:08:18] Sanctified and the Sanctified get filled
[1:08:19] with the Holy Ghost I want to see it
[1:08:22] every time we come together so let's
[1:08:24] come in a positive attitude lay aside
[1:08:26] your mully grubs lay aside how you've
[1:08:29] been hurt here and hurt there and let's
[1:08:31] press the
[1:08:33] battle let's press into the atmosphere
[1:08:35] of the Holy Ghost where all things are
[1:08:40] possible when we speak of
[1:08:43] atmosphere and it being unsettled it's
[1:08:45] true that the world is in an uproar over
[1:08:48] the atmosphere right now as it relates
[1:08:50] to the
[1:08:51] climate they're in up in an U War over
[1:08:54] that and as it relates to the weather
[1:08:56] and surely we we know we know that Satan
[1:08:59] can get in that and stir that
[1:09:01] up absolutely he can but but the
[1:09:03] unsettled atmosphere that I'm really
[1:09:05] speaking of would be the surrounding
[1:09:08] influences in the spir uh in the
[1:09:10] spiritual and the political environment
[1:09:12] in which we live in
[1:09:14] today the time we live in has been
[1:09:17] placed in the scripture by a prophet in
[1:09:20] this day as the leot toan
[1:09:22] age it is the last age and therefore it
[1:09:25] is what is commonly known even amongst
[1:09:28] many nominal churches that this is known
[1:09:31] as the end
[1:09:34] time but we don't guess about
[1:09:37] that we
[1:09:39] know this is the end time and now it's
[1:09:42] not unique in one sense
[1:09:45] that there have been other end times
[1:09:48] before there was an end time in Noah's
[1:09:51] day there was an end time in the days of
[1:09:53] of Sodom uh the Bible will even hearken
[1:09:57] to those days as representation of how
[1:10:00] things will be in this day because those
[1:10:02] were end times there was an end in
[1:10:05] Jesus's day as it was the end of the
[1:10:08] Jewish dis
[1:10:09] dispensation however we say all these
[1:10:11] things and they do relate to today but I
[1:10:14] want to emphasize this is not anend
[1:10:19] time this is the end
[1:10:22] time this is the wrapping up of all
[1:10:26] things th th th this is this is the
[1:10:29] winding up of time this is where the
[1:10:31] whole thing that God ever planned even
[1:10:34] from back before we were in in in
[1:10:36] existence here upon the Earth back in
[1:10:38] the back part of his mind this is where
[1:10:40] all of that wraps up in a
[1:10:43] Rapture and then and then from there
[1:10:45] here upon the Earth there's a
[1:10:46] tribulation and and then there there's a
[1:10:48] wedding supper and there's a millennium
[1:10:50] and then there is
[1:10:52] eternity this is is the end time and we
[1:10:56] can find similarities in the other end
[1:10:59] times that relate to this time but when
[1:11:02] it comes down to the fact that we stand
[1:11:04] on the edge of the Rapture of the church
[1:11:07] and and when we stand at the edge of the
[1:11:08] change of our bodies we can boldly say
[1:11:12] there has never been a day like this
[1:11:15] day there has never been a time like
[1:11:18] this time and yet the atmosphere around
[1:11:20] us is troubled and it's stirred up just
[1:11:23] as the Bible said it would
[1:11:25] be I've said this before and I'll say it
[1:11:28] again the end time condition should not
[1:11:31] trouble a
[1:11:33] Believer it should not bother a Believer
[1:11:36] it should not upset a Believer it should
[1:11:39] be a confirmation that everything you've
[1:11:41] ever believed and ever been taught is
[1:11:43] absolutely the truth it would trouble me
[1:11:47] if all of a sudden everything was really
[1:11:49] good and really smooth and perfect and
[1:11:52] it went on that way and I looked look
[1:11:53] around and go wait where are
[1:11:56] we where are we at in time I I don't
[1:11:59] understand this but because the
[1:12:01] scriptures tell us that this is how it's
[1:12:03] going to be then I can look around and
[1:12:06] go perfect I'm standing right where the
[1:12:08] prophet of God told me I was to be
[1:12:10] standing things are exactly how the word
[1:12:13] said it was going to be this doesn't
[1:12:15] trouble me this anchors me ever more so
[1:12:18] to know that when you see these things
[1:12:20] going on around you look up Redemption
[1:12:24] draweth nigh listen we don't got to wait
[1:12:26] ages and ages for the return of the lord
[1:12:29] The Return of the Lord is happening now
[1:12:32] we are in the midst of the Rapture of
[1:12:34] the church it is a process there's a
[1:12:36] shout and it has gone forth and now the
[1:12:38] church is being prepared to go up into a
[1:12:44] Rapture second Timothy 3:1 lays out the
[1:12:47] characteristic of the last days and and
[1:12:50] I just have a few of them here and a
[1:12:51] couple of them I even paraphrase
[1:12:54] but it says it'll be
[1:12:56] perilous that means
[1:12:58] dangerous
[1:13:01] check says men will be lovers of
[1:13:03] themselves that means they will be
[1:13:05] selfish yes are here we
[1:13:09] are they will be blasphemers Unholy no
[1:13:12] natural affection false accusers
[1:13:15] Fierce that means they will be savage or
[1:13:18] Untamed like
[1:13:21] Beast despisers of those who are good
[1:13:25] lovers of
[1:13:27] pleasure 1 Timothy 4:1 says now the
[1:13:30] spirit speaketh expressly that in the
[1:13:33] latter times some shall depart from the
[1:13:36] faith giving heed to seducing spirits
[1:13:39] and doctrines of devils speaking lies
[1:13:41] and hypocrisy having their conscience
[1:13:43] seared with a hot iron now I looked at
[1:13:46] that and I just thought just I thought
[1:13:48] about America in general not necessarily
[1:13:51] what we call the the message but just
[1:13:53] Christianity as a whole and I got to
[1:13:56] looking at at some numbers and it says
[1:13:59] about 64% of Americans call themselves
[1:14:02] Christians
[1:14:03] today says that might sound like a
[1:14:07] lot but 50 years ago that number was
[1:14:13] 90% many have departed from the faith
[1:14:17] and have had their conscience seared
[1:14:18] with a hot iron and it says and I don't
[1:14:21] I don't have it right here but it says
[1:14:22] if this rate
[1:14:25] continues by the year
[1:14:27] 2070 Christianity would be extinct in
[1:14:30] America
[1:14:31] am listen that number ain't going
[1:14:34] up that number ain't stabilizing
[1:14:37] churches are closing their doors day
[1:14:40] after day after day after day because
[1:14:43] there aren't enough people to even come
[1:14:44] and sit in the pews to even keep the
[1:14:46] lights on they are departing from the
[1:14:49] faith and yet in the midst of all that
[1:14:52] there's actually been a people that's
[1:14:53] been turned back to the faith to the
[1:14:57] faith of the fathers and While others
[1:14:58] are going down just like it was seen in
[1:15:00] a vision there is a people getting
[1:15:02] stronger and stronger and stronger and
[1:15:05] growing and growing and growing listen
[1:15:08] this trial can come this tribulation
[1:15:10] could come did it make your faith waver
[1:15:12] no absolutely not it just shook the dirt
[1:15:14] enough to let my roots go deeper and
[1:15:16] deeper and deeper listen Satan is
[1:15:18] barking up the wrong tree if he thinks
[1:15:20] this bride is about to quit if he thinks
[1:15:22] we're about to back off preaching Divine
[1:15:24] Healing if he thinks we're about to give
[1:15:26] up on our prodical out there in the
[1:15:28] world we're not giving up we're on the
[1:15:30] verge of the greatest most miraculous
[1:15:32] events in history I'm standing firm and
[1:15:35] I'm saying come Lord Jesus
[1:15:40] come I listened to brother Donnie last
[1:15:43] night talk about his precious daughter
[1:15:46] Erica and he said I believe more now
[1:15:50] than I ever have come am he said I'm
[1:15:54] going to pray for the sick now more than
[1:15:56] I ever have I'm going to have prayer
[1:15:59] lines more now than I ever
[1:16:02] have listen hard blows from the devil
[1:16:05] don't make a real believer
[1:16:08] quit it makes me recognize I got to
[1:16:11] buckle up I got to Annie up and I got to
[1:16:14] come back to the middle listen Bell's
[1:16:16] ringing it's time for the next round I
[1:16:18] can sit there in the ring and throw in
[1:16:19] the towel and say I quit and go down
[1:16:21] with the rest of them or I can rise up
[1:16:23] in faith and say yet he slay me yet I'll
[1:16:26] serve him he's a good god he's a mighty
[1:16:29] God he is an overcomer he is a conqueror
[1:16:32] and his children are the same thing I'm
[1:16:34] not quitting I'm not backing up I ain't
[1:16:36] going away we're not leaving until we
[1:16:39] leave here we're here to stay devil
[1:16:43] we're here to
[1:16:44] stay and we're operating in an
[1:16:47] atmosphere of
[1:16:48] Faith Matthew 24 tells us that Nations
[1:16:51] shall rise against Nation in Kingdom
[1:16:53] against
[1:16:55] Kingdom the accuracy of these scriptures
[1:16:57] and how it describes the current state
[1:16:59] of the world is actually
[1:17:02] astounding I mean it's not like well I
[1:17:04] can kind of see that oh it's pinpoint
[1:17:08] yes it's
[1:17:10] pinpoint this is the end
[1:17:13] time and the atmosphere is tore up and
[1:17:16] whipped up by
[1:17:19] Devils atmosphere of Oppression is what
[1:17:22] people live in every single
[1:17:25] day it's an atmosphere of
[1:17:28] attacking where people look for any
[1:17:30] reason to attack their fellow man
[1:17:33] atmosphere of hatred atmosphere of
[1:17:36] nervousness everybody's on edge amen
[1:17:39] it's an atmosphere of fear and
[1:17:42] anxiety and there is no peace to be
[1:17:47] had y I was thinking about this just the
[1:17:49] other
[1:17:50] day we had a situation where one of our
[1:17:53] cars broke down and I had to call a tow
[1:17:55] truck and the guy came and picked it up
[1:17:58] and towed it and dropped it off and I
[1:17:59] was just standing there talking the guy
[1:18:02] he seemed friendly
[1:18:04] enough and I said man I bet you know
[1:18:06] being in this job sometimes you get
[1:18:09] putting some dangerous situations huh he
[1:18:12] said oh every single
[1:18:15] day he said but I ain't worried about
[1:18:19] it he said somebody go ahead and shoot
[1:18:21] me just put me out of my misery
[1:18:26] like man that that turned so
[1:18:30] quick I was just trying to talk to the
[1:18:32] guy and he he's hoping I'd shoot
[1:18:38] him but I I left there and it actually
[1:18:41] was heavy on me for a minute and I said
[1:18:43] that's how people are walking around in
[1:18:46] misery right there's no peace to be had
[1:18:50] because the world that we live in is not
[1:18:52] conduced Ive to peace the atmosphere all
[1:18:55] around us is unsuitable for peace and
[1:18:57] the reason that is is because the one
[1:18:59] who has dominion over this atmosphere
[1:19:02] the one who has dominion over this Earth
[1:19:04] because we fail the one who has dominion
[1:19:07] over all the kingdoms of the earth is a
[1:19:09] liar and a murderer and the father of it
[1:19:13] you can't have peace when the atmosphere
[1:19:16] is ruled by a liar and a
[1:19:18] murderer brother brandham said here in
[1:19:21] Victory Day He said Jesus said in St
[1:19:23] Matthew 24 said you'll hear of wars and
[1:19:26] rumors of wars and wars and War why
[1:19:29] because the prince of the earth Satan
[1:19:32] the power of the Nations there's a
[1:19:34] national Spirit here a national Spirit
[1:19:37] here it's
[1:19:39] Devils they can't get along with one
[1:19:42] another
[1:19:44] see now stop for just a minute before we
[1:19:47] read too deep into that just CU you
[1:19:50] can't get along with somebody
[1:19:54] don't mean it's cuz they're
[1:19:58] Devils that's
[1:20:01] good but what brother Bram says here is
[1:20:03] he says that is why there's wars and
[1:20:05] rumors of wars because the Devils that
[1:20:08] run the atmosphere of those Nations
[1:20:11] cannot get along with one another and so
[1:20:15] what I'm speaking on to you today is the
[1:20:17] battle for
[1:20:20] atmospheres the battle for ATM
[1:20:23] atmospheres so notice the current
[1:20:25] atmosphere we live in is controlled by
[1:20:29] the Devil by Satan himself the prince of
[1:20:34] the power of the air now when we say
[1:20:36] that like I already said when it said
[1:20:37] the prince of the power of the air many
[1:20:39] times we just take that and think we
[1:20:40] mean the weather well tornadoes came
[1:20:42] he's the prince of the power of the air
[1:20:44] that's true that's not a wrong
[1:20:46] application but it's also speaking about
[1:20:48] the
[1:20:50] atmosphere in which the world lives
[1:20:52] under and operates in because many times
[1:20:54] brother Brandon would take and tie that
[1:20:56] that scripture about the prince of the
[1:20:58] power of the heir multiple times right
[1:21:00] into the temptation of Jesus when he
[1:21:03] offers them all the kingdoms of the
[1:21:05] world he would say something like this
[1:21:07] this is in the message Elijah the Bible
[1:21:10] said so Satan is the prince of the power
[1:21:12] of the air and every nation is under his
[1:21:16] Dominion the scripture says that s he
[1:21:19] says Satan quoted it to Jesus said the
[1:21:22] whole world
[1:21:23] all these kingdoms of mine and I will do
[1:21:25] with them what I
[1:21:28] will so when we see the scriptures that
[1:21:31] we've read about the end time and how
[1:21:33] pinpoint it is and like I said it's
[1:21:35] something that we recognize has to be
[1:21:37] fulfilled that has to be fulfilled the
[1:21:39] end time must be evil the atmosphere
[1:21:42] must be that Disturbed that tore up that
[1:21:45] it seems like we're on the edge of of of
[1:21:47] Civil War in our country all the time it
[1:21:49] seems like we're on the edge of World
[1:21:51] War III all the time
[1:21:53] the atmosphere is
[1:21:54] troubled and that's exactly how it had
[1:21:57] to be these things must come to pass and
[1:22:00] as Bleak as that sounds I'm not trying
[1:22:02] to paint a bleak picture to you as Bleak
[1:22:04] as it sounds it shouldn't Shake us even
[1:22:06] one little bit because they aren't the
[1:22:08] events that the bride is supposed to be
[1:22:10] focused on when it comes to end time
[1:22:13] scriptures there are other end time
[1:22:16] scriptures that we find our
[1:22:17] identification in I look right here at
[1:22:20] an end time scripture in Acts 2 and it
[1:22:22] shall come to pass in the last days
[1:22:24] saith God I will pour out my spirit upon
[1:22:28] All Flesh and your sons and your
[1:22:30] daughters shall prophesy and your young
[1:22:32] men shall see visions and your old men
[1:22:34] shall dream dreams identify with that
[1:22:37] scripture well the world Fallen apart
[1:22:39] yeah well the Lord is pouring out his
[1:22:41] Spirit upon All Flesh well this is going
[1:22:44] on over here and Russia is doing that
[1:22:46] well there's visioning happening there's
[1:22:48] prophecies going forth and the spirit of
[1:22:50] the Lord is being manifested amongst his
[1:22:53] people I find my identification
[1:22:58] there first Thessalonians 4:17 well
[1:23:01] there's going to be bombs and there's
[1:23:03] going to be this okay that's fine but I
[1:23:05] find my identification where it says
[1:23:07] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:23:09] be caught up together with them in the
[1:23:11] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:23:15] so shall we ever be with the
[1:23:20] Lord we should be focused on the the
[1:23:22] fact that the atmosphere is charged with
[1:23:26] the coming of the
[1:23:29] lord it's right here upon
[1:23:31] us we're in the very moments of his
[1:23:35] appearing the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:37] is at hand
[1:23:41] church he promised as Malachi 4 he did
[1:23:44] it he promised restoration he did it he
[1:23:48] promised to pour out his spirit and he's
[1:23:50] doing it he promised us heal in he's
[1:23:52] doing it he promised a Salvation for us
[1:23:55] in our Offspring and he's doing it he
[1:23:59] promised to come back and take away a
[1:24:00] bride and he's going to do it all these
[1:24:04] promises are the truth brother brandham
[1:24:07] spoke about the about the atmosphere
[1:24:09] there in Jerusalem and that atmosphere
[1:24:11] was just as stirred up at the time of
[1:24:13] Jesus as our atmosphere
[1:24:15] is it was just as stirred up and he it
[1:24:19] was an end time and and the politics
[1:24:21] were awful and there was Roman
[1:24:23] oppression and the Pharisees and the
[1:24:25] Sadducees were fighting amongst
[1:24:27] themselves and zealots were riding in
[1:24:29] the streets and fighting against the
[1:24:30] Romans the atmosphere was awful in
[1:24:35] Jerusalem it was an awful time and an
[1:24:37] awful place but to those that held on to
[1:24:40] the words of Jesus to those that knew he
[1:24:43] said he was coming to the Passover feast
[1:24:46] they were gathered in Little Homes and
[1:24:48] looking out their Windows anxiously and
[1:24:50] and and they had their Palm leaves ready
[1:24:52] and the atmosphere was charged with his
[1:24:55] appearing to those expecting him the
[1:24:58] atmosphere was charged with his
[1:25:00] coming how charged should we
[1:25:03] be what kind of anticipation should we
[1:25:06] be living
[1:25:09] under where should our thinking be on it
[1:25:12] how excited should we be to serve the
[1:25:15] Lord to have an opportunity an
[1:25:18] opportunity to be the ones who are alive
[1:25:21] and remain
[1:25:24] what a privilege to have received the
[1:25:27] message from the seventh Church age
[1:25:29] messenger the one who came to tie it all
[1:25:31] up how excited we should be to serve the
[1:25:34] Lord and if you're not it's because
[1:25:37] you're not expecting his
[1:25:38] appearing you're not expecting his
[1:25:41] coming brother brandham says the
[1:25:43] Christian knows it's the coming of the
[1:25:46] Lord see there's an atmosphere it
[1:25:50] depends on what you're looking at that's
[1:25:53] right there was a prophecy went forth
[1:25:56] last night over the pull pit there at
[1:25:58] Full Gospel
[1:26:00] Lighthouse as brother Andrew began to
[1:26:03] speak and I don't have the whole thing
[1:26:05] you can go listen to it at the end of
[1:26:06] the service and it came forth very
[1:26:08] powerfully I am the Lord God
[1:26:11] Almighty and he speaks about being I am
[1:26:13] Alpha and
[1:26:15] Omega and one thing I led that he said
[1:26:17] was I formed you before the foundation
[1:26:19] of the world and no one can erase you
[1:26:23] he said no one can erase you but it came
[1:26:26] right down it said at the end do not
[1:26:29] Slumber the Rapture is upon the
[1:26:34] church do not
[1:26:39] Slumber I don't know maybe this is a
[1:26:41] silly analogy but how many of you maybe
[1:26:44] children would
[1:26:46] understand how it feels maybe um maybe
[1:26:50] the day before Christmas
[1:26:52] or maybe how you feel when you fix and
[1:26:54] get to go on some big exciting trip and
[1:26:56] and you know you got to get up at 5: in
[1:26:57] the morning to catch a
[1:26:59] plane and you lay
[1:27:01] down but do you sleep
[1:27:04] well now you can't Slumber because you
[1:27:07] are
[1:27:10] excited
[1:27:12] hallu how can you
[1:27:15] Slumber how can you Slumber how can you
[1:27:17] slip into an atmosphere of negativity
[1:27:19] how can you slip into an atmosphere of
[1:27:20] the Lord at the late is coming
[1:27:23] how can you slip into an atmosphere of
[1:27:24] God don't move like that anymore how can
[1:27:26] you slip in that kind of atmosphere if
[1:27:28] you're excited and you know he's coming
[1:27:31] he's coming he's right here at the door
[1:27:33] oh Ju Just in the morning we may get up
[1:27:35] and go just in the morning tomorrow
[1:27:36] morning may be the time how can you
[1:27:39] Slumber and it shows your condition if
[1:27:41] you're able to Slumber if you're able to
[1:27:43] be lukewarm if you're able to be
[1:27:44] nonchalant about it you're not excited
[1:27:46] about it because you're not expecting
[1:27:48] him to really return or if you are
[1:27:50] you're not expecting it in the morning
[1:27:52] maybe some far off y under maybe years
[1:27:54] down the road maybe so but you don't
[1:27:55] know when he's coming for you so live
[1:27:57] excited live ready serve the Lord with
[1:28:00] purpose do not Slumber the coming of the
[1:28:03] lord The Rapture is upon the
[1:28:06] church do not
[1:28:10] Slumber brother BR says there's an
[1:28:12] atmosphere it depends on what you're
[1:28:14] looking at for our Lord has strictly
[1:28:16] told us what was going to happen at that
[1:28:18] time and we don't know the minute or
[1:28:20] hour but know
[1:28:22] that we're nearing something
[1:28:25] now you can feel it in the
[1:28:28] atmosphere church it's been dark a long
[1:28:30] time but day is about to break you can
[1:28:33] feel it in the atmosphere you can feel
[1:28:34] it charge through a place like it did
[1:28:36] this morning when the Lord comes down in
[1:28:39] a mighty way and there's just something
[1:28:40] different you just feel it pulsating
[1:28:42] something's about to happen something's
[1:28:44] about to take place you forgive us if we
[1:28:47] get a little bit excited because our
[1:28:48] Lord's coming forgive us if we get a
[1:28:50] little bit excited cuz we hear the the
[1:28:52] wagon wheels coming I was a nobody I was
[1:28:54] a little wash girl I didn't deserve
[1:28:56] anything I was lost and Bound for hell
[1:28:58] but he said I'm coming back for you
[1:29:00] others didn't believe it others said
[1:29:01] you're unworthy others said you sin too
[1:29:03] much others said you was an alcoholic
[1:29:05] others said you was a drugie others said
[1:29:06] you did too many things there's no way
[1:29:08] he'd ever want you but I hear the wagon
[1:29:10] wheels coming I hear it coming forgive
[1:29:12] me if I get excited I've been forgiven
[1:29:14] so much I've been forgiven so much it
[1:29:17] excites me that he's coming back for me
[1:29:19] I can't Slumber now I can't Slumber now
[1:29:24] he's coming back for
[1:29:29] me day is about to
[1:29:32] break and
[1:29:34] yet all that being
[1:29:37] said it is a
[1:29:39] constant
[1:29:41] War to live in and operate in the right
[1:29:47] atmosphere it is a constant fight
[1:29:50] because we are affected
[1:29:53] by the atmosphere that surrounds us at
[1:29:55] all times doesn't mean we give into it
[1:29:57] doesn't mean we cave into it but the
[1:30:00] Bible would describe it as a
[1:30:02] smoke and you know how it is you don't
[1:30:05] got to be just walk through
[1:30:08] it you walk through this atmosphere
[1:30:10] every day walk through smoke for a
[1:30:11] little bit it affects your clothes it
[1:30:14] gets on you that's why we come time
[1:30:17] after time to be washed Washed by the
[1:30:19] Water of the word I'm not saying you
[1:30:21] fell in sin saying junk gets on you and
[1:30:24] you want to be washed from it and cleans
[1:30:25] it and we get affected by it and you can
[1:30:27] have a bad day because of the atmosphere
[1:30:30] around you look I'm realistic we're
[1:30:32] human you go to work and your boss
[1:30:34] treats you like dirt and yells at you
[1:30:36] and blames you for stuff and does this
[1:30:37] and I don't expect you to come home be
[1:30:39] like woo hallelujah what a wonderful day
[1:30:42] it was awesome I hope I can do that
[1:30:44] again
[1:30:46] tomorrow that's that's not what I'm
[1:30:48] saying I understand that it affects us
[1:30:52] and so it is a battle to keep the right
[1:30:55] attitude towards
[1:30:57] Promises to Keep the right attitude
[1:30:59] towards
[1:31:02] people yeah
[1:31:07] people we have to
[1:31:10] operate from the same place of Grace and
[1:31:14] forgiveness that Jesus operated towards
[1:31:18] us when it comes to
[1:31:20] people
[1:31:23] regardless of their
[1:31:26] intent purpose not on purpose meant to
[1:31:28] hurt didn't mean to hurt lay all that
[1:31:30] aside because the atmosphere that we
[1:31:33] live in is to assign blame whose fault
[1:31:35] is
[1:31:36] it well who
[1:31:38] what but Jesus doesn't lay
[1:31:43] blame he offers
[1:31:46] forgiveness and Grace and if you'll
[1:31:49] operate in the place that without giving
[1:31:52] forgiveness you can't have
[1:31:55] forgiveness without offering Grace you
[1:31:57] can't have
[1:31:59] Grace then it'll change your perspective
[1:32:01] on a lot of things sitting there being
[1:32:04] nailed to the cross he said father
[1:32:06] forgive them they know not what they
[1:32:10] do now that being said I've had people
[1:32:12] say well I mean well yeah that was Jesus
[1:32:14] of course of course he could okay let's
[1:32:16] point to just a regular man filled with
[1:32:20] the Holy Ghost Steven
[1:32:24] being stoned and he says the exact same
[1:32:26] thing Lord don't lay this to their
[1:32:27] charge Lord don't hold this against them
[1:32:31] Stone Lord forgive that
[1:32:34] man Lord I hope he knows
[1:32:38] you easy to do
[1:32:41] no hardest thing
[1:32:44] ever but you got to operate from that
[1:32:47] place where else you'll find yourself
[1:32:48] with Grudge after Grudge after Grudge
[1:32:50] and hurt after hurt after hurt and funny
[1:32:53] feeling after funny feeling and I can't
[1:32:55] fellowship with this one I don't want to
[1:32:56] sit by that one and then this one gets
[1:32:58] up to saying but I can't even be blessed
[1:32:59] by because I don't like this and she
[1:33:01] said that and what about this one here
[1:33:03] and look at him
[1:33:05] preaching I probably at some point in my
[1:33:08] life said something smart elic to
[1:33:12] you I'm
[1:33:17] sorry Lord I believe it's very important
[1:33:20] to be self-aware and understand your own
[1:33:21] shortcomings and your own
[1:33:23] faults because when you can't recognize
[1:33:25] yours you don't have Grace for
[1:33:33] others hey you don't even
[1:33:36] know me and this guy's buddies was that
[1:33:39] always the case no
[1:33:46] sir you got have Grace for people let
[1:33:49] God in a relationship he'll mold it up
[1:33:51] and fix it up and make it right but the
[1:33:54] problem is we're judging them through
[1:33:55] our own self-righteousness and how we
[1:33:57] think they should have and they
[1:33:58] shouldn't and they shouldn't and if
[1:33:59] you'll combine your list of Shas with
[1:34:01] their list yours probably longer than
[1:34:03] theirs I don't even know how we got
[1:34:05] there but there we are and we're going
[1:34:06] to move on now we got to operate from a
[1:34:08] place of Grace Place of forgiveness to
[1:34:11] where you can truly look at somebody and
[1:34:14] say I love you not say it because the
[1:34:17] Bible says you got to say
[1:34:19] it because if you forgiven you can do it
[1:34:25] easily
[1:34:27] amen atmospheres affect us and we have
[1:34:30] to battle to stay in the right
[1:34:32] atmosphere with the right attitude
[1:34:33] towards church towards promises towards
[1:34:36] people because like I said atmospheres
[1:34:39] affect people you have to be willing to
[1:34:42] war listen just because we have the
[1:34:44] ability to have the right atmosphere
[1:34:46] doesn't mean it always
[1:34:49] happens let's be real you come into
[1:34:52] church many
[1:34:53] times we talk about it in the back you
[1:34:56] talk about it sometimes it's just there
[1:34:59] man the atmosphere just first song first
[1:35:01] prayer it's charged
[1:35:03] and and you don't have to work at it
[1:35:05] it's just there and then there's
[1:35:08] times that we come in and it's
[1:35:12] not but our attitude isn't to be well
[1:35:15] everything's just off
[1:35:18] tonight oh another song I Don't Like
[1:35:23] what's wrong with the music tonight
[1:35:24] something just a little off timing
[1:35:29] seem sometimes you have to work at
[1:35:32] it sometimes you have to fight for it
[1:35:35] how bad do I want the Lord to move in
[1:35:37] this service today how bad do I need him
[1:35:40] in my home how bad do I need him to move
[1:35:42] on my behalf you know what things the
[1:35:44] atmosphere just ain't cracking and
[1:35:45] popping like it is sometimes I'm going
[1:35:47] to create one right here I'm going to
[1:35:49] create an atmosphere of worship right
[1:35:50] here and I'm I'm Let It Bleed over to
[1:35:52] this one and bleed over to this one and
[1:35:53] it never it may never start cracking and
[1:35:56] popping all over the place but it can be
[1:35:57] cracking and popping right where you're
[1:35:59] sitting as you invite the Holy Spirit to
[1:36:01] come and deal with me accept my worship
[1:36:04] accept my praise accept my offering
[1:36:07] we're going to have church right here
[1:36:08] tonight if you want to join me that's
[1:36:11] fine but right here I'm going to create
[1:36:14] an
[1:36:15] atmosphere I'm going to fight for
[1:36:18] [Applause]
[1:36:19] it you got to be with to war against the
[1:36:22] atmospheres and and fight to create the
[1:36:25] right
[1:36:26] ones the atmosphere in Jerusalem that we
[1:36:28] just
[1:36:29] described in many ways was just like the
[1:36:32] one we're in turmoil and struggle the
[1:36:36] people felt forgotten and the people
[1:36:37] felt
[1:36:38] Forsaken and there was a priest there by
[1:36:40] the name of
[1:36:42] Zacharias and the scripture says in Luke
[1:36:44] 1
[1:36:46] and6 that he was
[1:36:48] righteous before God amen don't get it
[1:36:52] in your mind that Zachariah was
[1:36:58] lukewarm him and his wife were both
[1:37:00] righteous before
[1:37:02] God walking
[1:37:05] in
[1:37:06] all there wasn't one he messed
[1:37:10] up
[1:37:11] all it didn't say he kept most of the
[1:37:15] Commandments
[1:37:17] all go to the next verse no act to no
[1:37:20] there it is at the end go back to
[1:37:23] six ordinance of the Lord this is the
[1:37:26] word I want you to look at blame
[1:37:31] L I know some of you think you could but
[1:37:33] I don't believe there's anybody here
[1:37:35] that I could stick that tag on this
[1:37:38] morning
[1:37:39] blameless but the scripture attaches it
[1:37:42] to
[1:37:45] him
[1:37:50] blameless
[1:37:52] but even the most Ardent
[1:37:55] Christians even the ones that are most
[1:37:58] devout filled with the
[1:38:01] spirit can allow themselves to get worn
[1:38:04] down by
[1:38:07] circumstance if they're not aware if
[1:38:09] they don't catch it if they don't
[1:38:11] recognize it in time and they get to a
[1:38:14] place where they begin to speak and give
[1:38:16] voice to the circumstances of the
[1:38:18] atmosphere around
[1:38:19] them and they began to speak in doubt
[1:38:23] and we begin to let the testimony of our
[1:38:26] lips give voice to the doubt that has
[1:38:28] crept into our thinking and give voice
[1:38:31] to to to to things that are contrary to
[1:38:35] the
[1:38:36] message because right there the Bible
[1:38:38] says he was in
[1:38:40] service doing the ordinances lighting
[1:38:42] the candles doing all that his job was
[1:38:44] to do so he's in the middle of service
[1:38:46] church as it
[1:38:47] were and an angel comes to him to
[1:38:50] deliver the message of go of John's
[1:38:55] birth and instead of rejoicing in
[1:38:58] it instead of shouting in it instead of
[1:39:00] going out and testifying of this
[1:39:03] wonderful miracle that God's doing
[1:39:04] before he'd ever even seen any sign of
[1:39:06] it
[1:39:08] happening he gave voice to the
[1:39:10] circumstance of his age not only the age
[1:39:12] he lived in but the age he
[1:39:14] was he gave voice to the atmosphere of
[1:39:17] doubt that plagued the people of his day
[1:39:19] and he says I can't believe this
[1:39:22] I'm too old my wife is too old this is
[1:39:29] impossible he looked at the
[1:39:31] circumstance you know the thing is the
[1:39:33] Bible actually says that the angel tells
[1:39:35] him that the Lord has heard your prayer
[1:39:38] it was actually the thing that he was
[1:39:40] praying
[1:39:41] for do we even believe what we're asking
[1:39:44] for
[1:39:45] sometimes Lord send us a child Lord Lord
[1:39:48] send me we want to have a child the Lord
[1:39:50] has heard your prayer you're going to
[1:39:50] have a child no
[1:39:53] way we're too old for
[1:39:56] that and it happened right in the middle
[1:39:58] of a service and how many times the Holy
[1:40:00] Spirit come down and anoint a man of God
[1:40:02] to be to begin speaking right to the
[1:40:03] thing you've been asking for begin to
[1:40:05] speak to it your children are coming
[1:40:07] back your children are coming back
[1:40:09] you're going to be healed of that cancer
[1:40:10] you're going to be delivered instead of
[1:40:12] yes Lord It's like but my kid's been
[1:40:14] gone 30
[1:40:17] years my kid don't even really know what
[1:40:20] the message about they're out there and
[1:40:22] the doctor says I can't get
[1:40:25] better right in the midst of the service
[1:40:27] under the anointing of the
[1:40:31] spirit and I want to ask you is anything
[1:40:34] too hard for the
[1:40:36] Lord and yet we respond to his promises
[1:40:39] our very prayers is being spoke back to
[1:40:44] us with
[1:40:46] doubt and with
[1:40:49] negativity but this is impossible
[1:40:52] possible but Lord and we speak doubt
[1:40:55] right in the face of the Angel we speak
[1:40:57] doubt right in the face of the promise
[1:40:59] we have to fight to stay in an
[1:41:02] atmosphere of Faith to where when that
[1:41:04] word comes forth we grab and goes yes
[1:41:06] that's right that's mine yes that's
[1:41:08] exactly right that's mine and not this
[1:41:11] can't
[1:41:11] be this can't be oh that's exactly what
[1:41:15] I've been praying for Lord that's
[1:41:18] exactly listen the Lord goes around
[1:41:20] dropping handfuls on purpose and we walk
[1:41:21] around going I'm
[1:41:23] hungry I'm
[1:41:25] hungry handful on purpose Lord give me
[1:41:28] something Lord meet my
[1:41:31] need Lord he's
[1:41:34] going and we walk right past
[1:41:37] it I guess it's never going to happen
[1:41:41] because the world around us is pressing
[1:41:43] in all the time and it's an atmosphere
[1:41:45] of doubt it's an atmosphere of of
[1:41:47] unbelief it's an atmosphere of this can
[1:41:49] never happen
[1:41:52] and you're surrounded by doubt and
[1:41:53] you're surrounded by an evil and chaotic
[1:41:58] atmosphere but that's no
[1:42:01] excuse you know what's incredible I was
[1:42:04] reading it's in Luke chapter 1 after
[1:42:06] this account I love
[1:42:08] how doubt took zachariah's voice
[1:42:12] away he could no longer speak no longer
[1:42:14] praise doubt will take your voice away
[1:42:18] too but what I love is when God brings
[1:42:21] his word to pass despite
[1:42:23] Zachariah and it says they handed him a
[1:42:26] tablet and he wrote the name
[1:42:30] John it says his mouth came open and the
[1:42:34] next 10 or 12 verses is him prophesying
[1:42:37] and giving glory and praise to God and
[1:42:41] what I see there is a man who recognized
[1:42:43] his error what I see is listen sometimes
[1:42:46] we come in doubt sometimes we come in
[1:42:47] fear sometimes we sit there in unbelief
[1:42:49] and wonder is this real is that the
[1:42:51] movement of the spirit is that really
[1:42:52] emotion well I doubt
[1:42:54] that's be careful I'll tell you this
[1:42:57] God's going to fulfill his word with or
[1:42:59] without you but when you see the word
[1:43:01] start to be in fulfilled at least have
[1:43:02] enough about you say I was wrong I
[1:43:04] Praise You Lord I give you glory Lord
[1:43:07] you are the king of kings you are the
[1:43:09] Lord of lords and Zachariah gives praise
[1:43:11] unto
[1:43:12] God when his mouth came open he used it
[1:43:15] for the right
[1:43:18] reasons but even though atmosphere B
[1:43:20] bothers us and attacks us and we have to
[1:43:22] war against it it's no excuse because in
[1:43:24] that exact same time in that exact same
[1:43:27] atmosphere visited by the exact same
[1:43:30] Angel is a little
[1:43:32] girl walking to the well but brother
[1:43:34] brandham says she'd been in an
[1:43:35] atmosphere they'd been talking about the
[1:43:37] message and they'd been reading the
[1:43:39] Scrolls and they were talking about how
[1:43:41] good the service was yesterday is that
[1:43:43] how your Mondays
[1:43:46] go hey it doesn't tell us Monday might
[1:43:48] have been horrible for her it might
[1:43:50] might have been the worst day of the
[1:43:51] week there might have been some rude
[1:43:52] people at the
[1:43:55] well but all I know was she was staying
[1:43:57] in the right atmosphere and in that
[1:43:59] atmosphere there was a Flicker and out
[1:44:01] of that flicker stepped an angel and it
[1:44:03] was the exact same angel that had come
[1:44:05] to Zachariah and told him and he said no
[1:44:07] that ain't going to happen but he tells
[1:44:09] her something even more difficult he
[1:44:11] says you're going to have a child
[1:44:12] without knowing a man and the holy
[1:44:13] spirit's going to overshadow you I say
[1:44:15] in a world full of doubters and a world
[1:44:16] full of Skeptics evening like Tabernacle
[1:44:18] let's be a Mary because Mary threw her
[1:44:20] shoulders back and said be it unto me
[1:44:22] Lord yes right there I take it that's my
[1:44:25] word I accept it let it be unto me
[1:44:28] there's going to be a Rapture well I
[1:44:29] don't know your sick are going to be
[1:44:30] healed I'm not sure all the prodical are
[1:44:32] coming home be it unto me be it unto me
[1:44:35] be it unto me I accept it I take it it's
[1:44:38] mine you can doubt all you want you can
[1:44:41] fear all you want but I'm walking in an
[1:44:43] atmosphere of faith our hearts have been
[1:44:46] turned back to Faith and I'm walking in
[1:44:49] that
[1:44:55] it's chaos
[1:44:59] everywhere things are impossible
[1:45:02] doctor's reports worse than it's ever
[1:45:04] been but we're walking in an
[1:45:07] atmosphere of
[1:45:09] faith and I can say I believe
[1:45:11] today more than I've ever believed
[1:45:15] before I believe now more than I've ever
[1:45:18] believed before that Lord you are my
[1:45:22] healer that Lord you are coming back to
[1:45:24] take a
[1:45:26] bride Lord that you are going to heal
[1:45:29] sister
[1:45:30] Jeanie Lord that you are going to heal
[1:45:32] Ron
[1:45:33] Spencer Lord that no matter what happens
[1:45:37] we believe more than
[1:45:40] ever I
[1:45:42] believe it is
[1:45:44] atmosphere that produces
[1:45:47] results one way or the other
[1:45:53] there was so many quotes and things
[1:45:54] about atmosphere and I had to kind of
[1:45:56] pick which way to go but brother brand
[1:45:58] I'm over and over teaches that it's
[1:46:00] atmosphere that brings the result you
[1:46:02] know how we talk about taking the egg
[1:46:03] and putting under a
[1:46:04] dog the atmosphere would make that egg
[1:46:08] hatch you got to get things in the right
[1:46:11] atmosphere he says and Brethren may I
[1:46:13] say this with reverence and respect to
[1:46:15] you as my brethren knowing that maybe
[1:46:18] before tonight before night we will all
[1:46:21] stand at the Judgment seat of Christ
[1:46:24] look may I say this it's the atmosphere
[1:46:28] always that brings forth the product
[1:46:31] see it's the
[1:46:33] atmosphere
[1:46:35] always that brings forth the product see
[1:46:39] and yet you're going to have to be
[1:46:40] willing to fight for that atmosphere
[1:46:43] Satan's not just giving it over going
[1:46:45] man y'all have a good time today man I
[1:46:48] just hope the Lord just really pours it
[1:46:49] out in there
[1:46:51] let me know how it goes when y'all come
[1:46:53] out no he ain't outside he's
[1:46:55] here he don't miss a
[1:46:58] service cuz he's here to battle the
[1:47:00] atmosphere he's here to fight your claim
[1:47:02] that you have a right to ascend into
[1:47:04] Heavenly
[1:47:05] places and he's here battling he's in
[1:47:08] your car battling teenagers he's in your
[1:47:10] room
[1:47:11] battling trying to get you to set the
[1:47:13] wrong atmosphere give into the wrong
[1:47:15] things he's in the home trying to make
[1:47:17] the wrong Atmosphere Trying to make you
[1:47:19] mouth off and be rebellious he fights
[1:47:21] you every single day to create the wrong
[1:47:23] atmosphere because in the wrong
[1:47:24] atmosphere God's children can't Blossom
[1:47:26] the way they're meant
[1:47:28] to the atmosphere all around us is
[1:47:32] filled with Devils we don't like to
[1:47:34] think of that we like to think oh
[1:47:35] there's angels all around there
[1:47:38] are but the atmosphere around us is
[1:47:41] filled with devils and tormentors and
[1:47:44] they're constantly pressing in on you
[1:47:47] trying to squeeze you and to press you
[1:47:49] into an atmosphere of negativity and
[1:47:51] doubt brother brandom says this now
[1:47:54] listen Satan is still here this is
[1:47:59] 1964 future home that's the reason all
[1:48:02] these things happen he is still here and
[1:48:05] all of his evil forces are still here
[1:48:08] notice that's why the earth now is
[1:48:10] filthy that's why the scum and
[1:48:13] ridiculous things that goes on Bloodshed
[1:48:15] War politics sin adultery all kinds of
[1:48:18] filthiness goes on is because that Satan
[1:48:21] is the ruler of the earth and this
[1:48:24] atmosphere he says you say the
[1:48:27] atmosphere yes sir both the heavens and
[1:48:31] earth now is contaminated with Devils
[1:48:34] that can accuse us before God Jesus is
[1:48:37] there to intercede for us see while the
[1:48:39] accusers keep pointing a finger saying
[1:48:41] they did this they did this they did
[1:48:45] this so it's all contaminated
[1:48:48] contaminated with devils
[1:48:51] accusing you day and night
[1:48:54] Non-Stop and they come and they accuse
[1:48:56] you in your ear and they accuse you in
[1:48:57] your mind and they accuse you before the
[1:48:59] Throne of
[1:49:00] God and we mentioned it earlier how how
[1:49:03] how they got there but we're going to
[1:49:04] stop for a minute we're going to go back
[1:49:06] in
[1:49:07] time we're going to see how he even got
[1:49:11] in this place and how man got in this
[1:49:13] place because we're going to go back
[1:49:15] before time even begin and and see how
[1:49:17] we got here to where it's such a bad
[1:49:20] attle for us to walk in faith and walk
[1:49:22] in the light because it wasn't that way
[1:49:23] for Adam it wasn't a battle at all that
[1:49:26] was the atmosphere that he lived in the
[1:49:28] atmosphere there was faith and peace and
[1:49:30] love he didn't have to fight it it's
[1:49:33] what it
[1:49:35] was because we can
[1:49:39] live in an atmosphere of Peace an
[1:49:43] atmosphere of Faith an atmosphere where
[1:49:45] there's where there's no fear where
[1:49:47] there's no funny feelings right now amen
[1:49:50] even in the midst of the greater
[1:49:52] atmosphere that would surround us on a
[1:49:54] daily basis we read in Genesis
[1:49:57] 1 that the world was without form and
[1:50:00] void and it was
[1:50:03] dark there was nothing it was without
[1:50:05] form it was in horrible shape there was
[1:50:07] no light there was churning Waters
[1:50:09] brother Bram says the world was without
[1:50:11] form and it was void and darkness was
[1:50:13] upon the Earth nothing but a complete
[1:50:19] chaos he then says in power of
[1:50:21] transformation and the Bible said in the
[1:50:23] beginning back there that the world was
[1:50:25] without form and was void there was
[1:50:27] nothing but just a darkness of chaos and
[1:50:31] what a horrible shape it must have been
[1:50:32] in nothing but but but way into darkness
[1:50:36] Yonder without light or anything and the
[1:50:39] churning of the water and that wondering
[1:50:41] star twisting around and around and
[1:50:43] orbits out there somewhere it must have
[1:50:46] been a Terri terrific mass of something
[1:50:49] lost
[1:50:51] like it couldn't find its
[1:50:54] way now what I want to focus on here for
[1:50:57] the next couple minutes is God's ability
[1:50:59] to take something like that that's and
[1:51:02] to completely change the
[1:51:05] situation I want you to see as as
[1:51:07] brother Brandon would preach this sermon
[1:51:09] and call it God's power to transform you
[1:51:12] ought to go listen to it God's power to
[1:51:16] transform but he describes it as we just
[1:51:18] read here as an absolute master of chaos
[1:51:21] chaos meaning complete disorder and
[1:51:24] confusion it was an awful condition but
[1:51:28] the Bible says there in Genesis 1 and
[1:51:30] two that the spirit of God
[1:51:34] moved church that's the key to
[1:51:36] everything you're facing this morning
[1:51:38] that's the key to every trial every
[1:51:40] situation every prodal every sickness
[1:51:43] that the spirit of God would move on
[1:51:45] that situation this morning when the
[1:51:47] spirit of God moved things began to to
[1:51:50] take place when the spirit of God moves
[1:51:52] chaos begins to come into perfect order
[1:51:55] and out of that great
[1:51:57] chaos came the Garden of
[1:52:00] Eden think about it this was the
[1:52:02] condition of the earth and the spirit of
[1:52:04] God moves and out of that comes an
[1:52:10] Eden chaos to Eden the entire picture
[1:52:14] changed because the spirit of God moved
[1:52:16] and because a word was spoke over that
[1:52:19] chaos there was a word spoke and the
[1:52:21] spirit of God moved it went from an
[1:52:23] unimaginable chaotic atmosphere where
[1:52:26] where everything was out of order like a
[1:52:28] terrific mass of something lost to the
[1:52:30] most Sublime most perfect peaceful
[1:52:34] atmosphere the world has ever
[1:52:39] known your world may be in utter chaos
[1:52:42] right
[1:52:43] now your situation may be unfathomable
[1:52:46] to
[1:52:47] you you may have got a report that you
[1:52:50] never thought you were going to get your
[1:52:52] children may be in places you never
[1:52:53] foresaw when you were raising them in
[1:52:55] your home your health may be in a place
[1:52:57] that there's no way to come back your
[1:52:59] spiritual walk your lukewarmness your
[1:53:01] family situation your your loved ones
[1:53:03] are out there like a twirling star lost
[1:53:05] somewhere and can't find its way but all
[1:53:07] you need is for the spirit of God to
[1:53:10] move upon that situation all you need is
[1:53:13] for one word One Moment spoke over that
[1:53:15] situation in the most chaotic most
[1:53:18] horrible most terrible situation becomes
[1:53:20] an Eden again it becomes a restored
[1:53:22] daughter a restored son a Sav family a
[1:53:26] family in harmony a church in harmony
[1:53:28] because the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:53:31] face of the deep all you need is for the
[1:53:34] spirit of God to move I don't see a way
[1:53:37] out you need the spirit of God to move I
[1:53:39] don't understand how this is going to
[1:53:40] work out my job's terrible I need a new
[1:53:42] job situation you need the spirit of God
[1:53:45] to move that's all you need is the
[1:53:47] answer and the remedy to all your
[1:53:49] troubles
[1:53:52] the devil gets in the atmosphere and he
[1:53:54] begins to stir and he begins to work and
[1:53:56] whip up storms against you but your
[1:53:58] chaos is not too hard for God your
[1:54:01] situation is not too hard for God you
[1:54:04] just need the spirit of God to move in
[1:54:05] that situation one word church I believe
[1:54:09] he's here to do it I believe he's here
[1:54:11] to meet your needs even this morning I
[1:54:14] believe he's here to move on your job
[1:54:15] situation even this morning I believe
[1:54:17] he's here to drive that cancer out of
[1:54:19] your body even this morning I believe
[1:54:21] he'll drive that anxiety that you've
[1:54:22] been dealing with out of your body even
[1:54:24] this morning that Spirit of depression
[1:54:26] out of your body even this morning that
[1:54:28] Spirit of cancer out of brother Ron's
[1:54:30] body even this morning I believe he's
[1:54:32] here to move upon the face of the deep
[1:54:35] the deep and the dark situations that we
[1:54:37] don't know what to do with and I just
[1:54:38] say move on the situation Lord let the
[1:54:41] spirit of God turn loose in this place
[1:54:43] this morning turn it loose and let's see
[1:54:46] an Eden come forth out of the chaos
[1:54:49] let's see a healing come forth out of
[1:54:50] the
[1:54:53] sickness he can take your situation and
[1:54:55] transform it into a
[1:54:58] testimony into a testimony of his power
[1:55:01] to
[1:55:03] transform the Earth is transformed there
[1:55:06] into an
[1:55:08] Eden and in the atmosphere of Eden
[1:55:11] there's no fear wo how good that
[1:55:14] sounds there's no fear in that
[1:55:18] atmosphere they don't know worry and
[1:55:19] sick
[1:55:21] and in that atmosphere Adam operates as
[1:55:23] a Son of
[1:55:24] God and he has dominion and he operates
[1:55:27] in the power of the spoken word he could
[1:55:30] stop the wind he could move a
[1:55:32] tree all by speaking to it because he
[1:55:36] had Dominion now that Satan is going to
[1:55:39] ascend to at some point and in that
[1:55:42] atmosphere he was on speaking terms with
[1:55:45] God I want to get this to you because
[1:55:49] there was fellow ship in the cool of the
[1:55:50] evening and God would come down and walk
[1:55:53] with his children there was no sin to
[1:55:55] separate them there was no reason that
[1:55:57] he couldn't do that that's right so he
[1:55:59] would come down and walk in the cool of
[1:56:00] the of the evening with his children in
[1:56:03] that Eden atmosphere because there was
[1:56:05] nothing between God and man the
[1:56:07] atmosphere as it were was
[1:56:09] clear but there came a time as you well
[1:56:12] know that that atmosphere
[1:56:14] changed everything changed because Satan
[1:56:17] wanted to get back into the heavens to
[1:56:19] get back to a place where he could rule
[1:56:21] and operate from a position of
[1:56:23] dominion and he had a plan to do this
[1:56:26] and he comes and he attacks and he
[1:56:28] causes man to fall and in that fall he
[1:56:32] steps into that position and man can no
[1:56:35] longer operate there and because man
[1:56:38] cannot operate there now there's
[1:56:40] something between him and
[1:56:42] God and so it breaks Fellowship between
[1:56:45] God and
[1:56:46] man Fellowship is broken and now fear
[1:56:50] enters in death enters in fellowship
[1:56:53] with God Is Lost and the Earth is given
[1:56:55] over to the devil the atmosphere is
[1:56:58] given over to the devil and I want to
[1:57:00] put it like this brother brandham says
[1:57:03] the heavens was shut
[1:57:06] off think about that one day God's
[1:57:08] coming down it's a regular occurrence
[1:57:10] you're walking with
[1:57:12] God I don't mean in the sense like we do
[1:57:15] I mean in the sense like he came down
[1:57:16] and walked beside them and they talk to
[1:57:19] him and how was your day kind of
[1:57:22] talk like children talk to their fathers
[1:57:25] that was a common occurrence and the
[1:57:26] next day the heavens are
[1:57:30] sealed shut
[1:57:32] off man completely separated from God
[1:57:36] and now there's a great mist and a fog
[1:57:38] of demon powers between the heavens and
[1:57:41] the Earth where once God would come down
[1:57:44] no more the powers was cut off the
[1:57:47] fellowship was cut off and as we saw
[1:57:49] there in our opening scripture in
[1:57:50] Ephesians Satan becomes entrenched as
[1:57:53] the ruler of the earth and as the prince
[1:57:55] of the power of the air and man begins
[1:57:57] to wander
[1:57:59] Alone brother Bram says after he lost
[1:58:01] his fellowship with God he become a
[1:58:04] Wanderer had to shift for himself God
[1:58:07] taken care of him before but now he
[1:58:09] finds he has to shift for himself and
[1:58:11] it's a pretty hard thing so he doesn't
[1:58:14] have a loving father to watch over him
[1:58:16] and protect him and guide him and direct
[1:58:17] him and feed him and cloth him and care
[1:58:20] for him like he did so instead of coming
[1:58:22] back he tries to find his own way he
[1:58:24] wants to make his own way back man wants
[1:58:27] to make his own way he always has always
[1:58:29] will I suppose try to find his own way
[1:58:31] and every time he makes his own way he
[1:58:34] gets it
[1:58:37] wrong take that for yourself this
[1:58:39] morning especially I'll say it for men
[1:58:41] it's hard for us sometimes you know how
[1:58:42] we don't like to stop and ask
[1:58:45] directions no I'll figure it out no I
[1:58:49] think I remember up here there's this
[1:58:51] one
[1:58:52] road that we're going to
[1:58:55] take goes
[1:58:59] east and we get it
[1:59:01] wrong sometimes we might get there but
[1:59:05] it may take a few extra turns and a few
[1:59:06] roads you didn't have to go
[1:59:10] down if you need to get back to God just
[1:59:13] do it his way just
[1:59:15] repent just make it right just come back
[1:59:19] to God and let him guide you don't try
[1:59:22] to do it on your
[1:59:24] own and soon in this new atmosphere
[1:59:26] without fellowship and seemingly with
[1:59:29] without hope man begins to slip once
[1:59:31] again into the chaos that was there
[1:59:34] before
[1:59:35] e a whirling Mass
[1:59:39] lost and the generations that followed
[1:59:41] the first Adam lost touch with Eden Eden
[1:59:44] became a story Grandpa
[1:59:47] told Eden became almost
[1:59:50] mythical Eden became something that was
[1:59:53] for a past
[1:59:54] age fellowship with God and worshiping
[1:59:57] God became
[1:59:59] optional and without contact and without
[2:00:03] fellowship and with the atmosphere
[2:00:05] clogged with demons in doubt they lost
[2:00:09] touch and the prophet of God says man in
[2:00:11] the fall has lost his conscience of what
[2:00:14] father put him on Earth to
[2:00:17] do in other words all the plumbing as it
[2:00:20] was in our brains and the outlets of
[2:00:22] faith has been clogged up with the
[2:00:25] business affairs with home life domestic
[2:00:27] things it all becomes so clogged up with
[2:00:29] that until God can't operate through
[2:00:33] those channels that he made a man
[2:00:37] for he specifically designed every part
[2:00:40] of your body to work in a certain way
[2:00:42] that life could function and he
[2:00:44] specifically designed it that he could
[2:00:46] function through it but through the fall
[2:00:50] man lost contact lost Consciousness lost
[2:00:53] the why they were here what their
[2:00:55] functions were supposed to be for and I
[2:00:58] want to say you better stay in contact
[2:01:00] with
[2:01:01] God stay in contact with God and stay in
[2:01:04] his word and stay in Fellowship I I
[2:01:07] don't care how good your home is and how
[2:01:09] good mom and daddy have it how much they
[2:01:11] stay in contact you better stay in
[2:01:13] contact with God or else you end up
[2:01:16] forgetting why you're here don't let it
[2:01:20] be long periods of time between your
[2:01:22] fellowship with God I I don't care how
[2:01:24] many times you've had encounters don't
[2:01:26] let it go camp to Camp before you have
[2:01:29] another experience before you have
[2:01:31] another move don't even let it go
[2:01:32] service to service stay in contact with
[2:01:35] God because what got man in this trouble
[2:01:38] was when they fell fellowship and
[2:01:40] contact was cut off and they forgot what
[2:01:42] they were here
[2:01:44] for they forgot their very
[2:01:46] purpose so don't let it go long periods
[2:01:49] of time without that contact because
[2:01:51] that's how Satan got us in this mess to
[2:01:53] begin
[2:01:54] with but I do want to say and we'll
[2:01:56] bring this around here in a minute that
[2:01:58] we live in a different situation than
[2:02:00] the Saints of old because Jesus came and
[2:02:03] he made a way of
[2:02:05] access so that now you can have that
[2:02:08] Fellowship once again you can have that
[2:02:11] contact once again but you're going to
[2:02:13] have to fight for
[2:02:15] it but it's worth fighting
[2:02:17] for yes it's worth fighting for the
[2:02:21] generations after Adam that they they
[2:02:23] forgot their purpose the generations
[2:02:26] after Adam for forgot because all the
[2:02:28] outlets were
[2:02:29] clogged and I want to say this the
[2:02:31] atmospheres were clogged and the same
[2:02:33] thing happened after the second
[2:02:37] Adam because now he has another body on
[2:02:39] Earth and it's not just my body it's not
[2:02:41] just yours but it's the body of
[2:02:43] Christ it's the
[2:02:45] church and they forgot what the body of
[2:02:48] Christ would was made for amen they
[2:02:51] forgot what the purpose of his body on
[2:02:53] the Earth was for just like this body of
[2:02:56] Flesh was designed in a way with every
[2:02:58] little part in mind it was designed in a
[2:03:01] way uh uh that that life could flow
[2:03:03] through it God designed his church in a
[2:03:06] perfect way and each part of the design
[2:03:08] plays a critical role in it living and
[2:03:11] functioning
[2:03:13] properly we can't forget what the church
[2:03:15] is here for we can't let let Amnesia as
[2:03:18] it were come in and cut us off from what
[2:03:20] he put us here
[2:03:22] for we can't allow the ideas of man to
[2:03:25] change while we're here the ideas and
[2:03:27] doctrines of man to to change the way we
[2:03:29] operate we can't go for long periods of
[2:03:32] time without him moving in a
[2:03:37] service we can't just say it's okay just
[2:03:40] to have an average service there should
[2:03:41] be no such thing as an average service
[2:03:44] you should be able to leave every
[2:03:45] service and be able to tell what God did
[2:03:47] for you in that service how God spoke to
[2:03:49] your heart in that service how you're
[2:03:51] going to apply it to your life what came
[2:03:53] out of that service it wasn't average it
[2:03:55] was words of eternal life anointed by
[2:03:58] the spirit of God moving over those
[2:04:03] words because it doesn't take long
[2:04:05] sitting in a dead atmosphere to think
[2:04:07] that's a normal
[2:04:10] atmosphere it doesn't take long sitting
[2:04:12] in a formal atmosphere to think that's a
[2:04:14] normal
[2:04:17] atmosphere this body of Christ is built
[2:04:20] for the
[2:04:21] supernatural I'm going to remind you how
[2:04:23] he made the body he made it for
[2:04:26] Supernatural he made it to soar in the
[2:04:28] heavenlies he made it for the miraculous
[2:04:31] he made it for manif manifesting his
[2:04:33] power this body is for the heavenlies
[2:04:35] it's built for manifestations of the
[2:04:38] spirit listen the body of Christ can't
[2:04:41] stand the atmosphere of a chicken
[2:04:44] yarn the body of Christ can't stand the
[2:04:47] atmosphere of negativity
[2:04:49] amen the body of Christ can't stand the
[2:04:52] atmosphere of chickens who go around and
[2:04:55] and nitpick one
[2:04:57] another you know that's what happens
[2:04:59] when a chicken gets a sore right all the
[2:05:02] other chickens gather around and they
[2:05:04] peck
[2:05:06] it and make it
[2:05:09] worse whereas
[2:05:11] Eagles when they see another one of the
[2:05:14] Eagles there scabbed over and down in
[2:05:15] the valley they'll drop food to them
[2:05:18] brother I see you're struggling this
[2:05:19] might help I see you're going through
[2:05:22] something this might help instead of
[2:05:24] well I can't believe you did that what
[2:05:27] were you thinking what is wrong with
[2:05:30] you this isn't helping me at
[2:05:37] all the body of Christ is made for the
[2:05:39] chicken
[2:05:40] yarn it's made to lift up above into the
[2:05:44] Heavenly atmospheres never forget what
[2:05:46] this body is designed for brother brand
[2:05:48] puts it clear right here he said if God
[2:05:50] designed man's body he certainly
[2:05:52] designed the body of his son the church
[2:05:55] and he has designed us to come together
[2:05:57] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and
[2:06:00] have these Supernatural workings of God
[2:06:03] Outlets through gifts of the Spirit such
[2:06:06] as prophecy and wisdom and knowledge and
[2:06:09] Gifts of healing and all these other
[2:06:11] different gifts it's Outlets that God
[2:06:14] lets out his power and lets out his
[2:06:17] revelation to the people that's how God
[2:06:22] designed the body remember one thing you
[2:06:23] didn't design the body I didn't design
[2:06:26] the body so let's don't go and church
[2:06:28] order all the outlets right out of the
[2:06:30] body to where God can't live and move
[2:06:32] and express himself the way the body was
[2:06:35] designed to live and move and express
[2:06:38] itself it's designed in that way without
[2:06:41] Outlets let's not forget what the body
[2:06:44] is for it's to manifest him
[2:06:49] manifest his glory manifest his power
[2:06:52] manifest his
[2:06:54] miracles because the devil knows if I
[2:06:57] can clog up the
[2:06:59] outlets if I can clog up the outlets I
[2:07:01] they can't get no power from
[2:07:04] it if the outlets are clogged up and
[2:07:06] they forget that it's supposed to flow
[2:07:08] like this and it's allowed to flow like
[2:07:10] that and I restored the gifts here so
[2:07:12] that it would manifest my power if they
[2:07:15] forget then they can't get no power from
[2:07:17] the outlet
[2:07:19] don't let the outlets get clogged up
[2:07:21] evening like
[2:07:22] Tabernacle don't let the outlets get
[2:07:25] clogged up I say we coming to a place
[2:07:27] that we we ought to Let Freedom Ring in
[2:07:29] the house of God we got to let the life
[2:07:32] flow through Eden and light Tabernacle
[2:07:34] to to create an atmosphere of life where
[2:07:36] God can flow through every one of these
[2:07:38] Outlets that he designed and God can
[2:07:40] manifest himself through his body that
[2:07:42] he
[2:07:43] designed and that's why we drive at home
[2:07:46] so much that's why we preach about it so
[2:07:48] much brother brandom says here that
[2:07:51] whatever is taught in a church is the
[2:07:53] atmosphere you will
[2:07:55] find but y'all talk about that a lot I
[2:07:57] know that's the atmosphere we want y'all
[2:08:00] preach about that a lot yeah yeah
[2:08:01] because we want that atmosphere we want
[2:08:03] the atmosphere where somebody can get
[2:08:04] receive the Holy Ghost we want an
[2:08:06] atmosphere where where a sinner can weep
[2:08:08] his way to Calvary we want an atmosphere
[2:08:10] where the miraculous takes place and so
[2:08:12] we preach about that all the time he
[2:08:15] says and now we find out that those
[2:08:17] atmospheres he says and you get in
[2:08:20] wherever those things where faith is
[2:08:21] taught in a church you'll find a church
[2:08:24] in that atmosphere where faith is
[2:08:26] preached from the word the children live
[2:08:29] amen and then in a way only brother Bram
[2:08:32] can do he just says it real simply
[2:08:34] that's the difference it's just life and
[2:08:37] death it's just life and death so we
[2:08:42] have to be careful when we go to
[2:08:43] labeling things with it's just emotion
[2:08:47] or it's just this or it's just that
[2:08:51] wherever you want to label it whatever
[2:08:53] side of the things you well they just
[2:08:54] starts before you go to labeling
[2:08:56] anything brother brandham labeled it as
[2:08:59] it's just life and
[2:09:02] death so how are we supposed to act
[2:09:05] there's not a rule book you're supposed
[2:09:08] to be free that's how you're supposed to
[2:09:11] act yes sir thank
[2:09:15] you pe people sometimes get it wrong and
[2:09:18] they get the wrong idea and they think
[2:09:20] that we promote things like isua
[2:09:22] Pentecost and like we say they had their
[2:09:24] place in the restoration we understand
[2:09:27] that but what isua
[2:09:30] became was not freedom of
[2:09:33] worship because they had to that's you
[2:09:37] had to speak in tongues or you had to
[2:09:39] run you had to shout or it wasn't a good
[2:09:42] service that's not Freedom at all that's
[2:09:45] bondage we're not promoting that we want
[2:09:48] you to run jump sh what we're promoting
[2:09:50] is freedom to where when God moves you
[2:09:54] can move how God leads you to move
[2:09:56] that's
[2:09:58] it that's it and if you have a problem
[2:10:02] with the promotion of Freedom that means
[2:10:03] you have are promoting bondage it's a
[2:10:06] matter of life and death it's black and
[2:10:08] white there is no gray area in this
[2:10:10] discussion are y'all for emotion no I'm
[2:10:12] For
[2:10:14] Freedom it's not singling things out are
[2:10:17] you for this it's are you for Freedom or
[2:10:19] are you for bondage that's the two
[2:10:22] categories that's the
[2:10:25] categories we're for
[2:10:27] Freedom this has to be a place where we
[2:10:29] always will Let Freedom Ring because if
[2:10:30] we're not careful and I want to go down
[2:10:32] this just because I feel too and it
[2:10:34] might take up a little bit of my time
[2:10:35] but I feel to go here don't get to the
[2:10:39] place to where because there wasn't
[2:10:42] shouting running jumping tongues that
[2:10:44] you don't walk away and think it was a
[2:10:46] good service do not get to that
[2:10:52] place many times some of the greatest
[2:10:54] most powerful Services have this sweet
[2:10:56] solemn spirit that just drops in and
[2:10:58] deals with the man and woman's
[2:11:03] heart always be impressed by the
[2:11:09] word the quality of the word which the
[2:11:13] word itself is good quality right but
[2:11:16] what what what is preached
[2:11:19] and the way the Lord comes behind it and
[2:11:21] the way he operates in the heart
[2:11:23] determines or should determine how we
[2:11:25] label it not that we should label
[2:11:26] service I'm just speaking in a way we
[2:11:28] can all understand that it was a good
[2:11:30] service because if we get to the place
[2:11:33] like it got in isua to where it was such
[2:11:36] a good service we ran and screamed and
[2:11:37] shouted so much that we didn't have
[2:11:40] preaching you're not in a good
[2:11:45] place a good service is when God deals
[2:11:48] with
[2:11:49] hearts that's a good service now we have
[2:11:53] preferences or we have times
[2:11:56] of refreshing in the Lord he y'all know
[2:12:00] me y'all know how I feel and how
[2:12:01] emotional I get I'm all about
[2:12:03] it you run around the church right now
[2:12:06] you ain't going to offend me
[2:12:07] none I'm for it sometimes we need it but
[2:12:10] God knows what we need and when we need
[2:12:13] it we do not want nor do we promote an
[2:12:17] emotional work up now if God moves
[2:12:20] through the building and you get
[2:12:21] emotional I'm all for it why wouldn't
[2:12:24] you how can you
[2:12:31] not I'll move
[2:12:33] on atmospheres
[2:12:36] produce atmospheres
[2:12:39] produce man fell back into chaos again
[2:12:42] and after the fall Satan ruled
[2:12:43] completely over the atmosphere and I'm
[2:12:45] going to go quickly now darkness and
[2:12:47] Gloom Blom hung over the Earth
[2:12:49] Fellowship was broken Heavens was shut
[2:12:51] off from
[2:12:52] Mankind and yet that was all about to
[2:12:55] change I want you to think about the
[2:12:57] place that man stood with no access to
[2:12:59] Heavens prayers couldn't even Ascend
[2:13:02] there was no access to Fellowship man
[2:13:05] was that twirling star lost in a matter
[2:13:07] of chaos that was the condition of man
[2:13:09] but it was all about to change because
[2:13:12] the very one who originally had spoke
[2:13:14] Eden out of a chaos had spoke Eden out
[2:13:17] of turmoil
[2:13:18] had spoke Eden out of that awful
[2:13:20] condition that the Earth had been in was
[2:13:23] determined once again to have fellowship
[2:13:25] with man he was determined that chaos
[2:13:28] would not always reain over the hearts
[2:13:30] of his children he was determined to
[2:13:32] make a way I'm so thankful today that he
[2:13:35] made the way and and he he was
[2:13:38] determined and it was chaos in the
[2:13:40] beginning and the spirit of God moved
[2:13:43] and then it was chaos after the fall and
[2:13:45] God became flesh oh Hallelujah the
[2:13:49] spirit of God moved and brought an Eden
[2:13:51] and then there fell and then there was
[2:13:52] chaos and then God became flesh and
[2:13:55] stepped in and stepped down into Earth
[2:13:58] and that flesh came down in the most
[2:14:00] chaotic time and he came down in that
[2:14:03] time to show how a man can create an
[2:14:05] atmosphere around himself of Peace in
[2:14:08] the midst of a storm he came and showed
[2:14:10] how that Satan may be the prince of the
[2:14:12] power of the air and and he may be able
[2:14:14] to stir things up and and bring up a
[2:14:16] storm and bring things up against you
[2:14:18] but he was still subject to the word
[2:14:20] when the word would stand and say peace
[2:14:21] be
[2:14:22] still he came to show that even though
[2:14:25] he's the prince of the power of the air
[2:14:26] when you take the word upon your lips on
[2:14:29] the mouth of a believing man or woman
[2:14:30] it's the same as deity speaking and he
[2:14:32] may have put his foot up on the bow of a
[2:14:34] boat and stopped a physical storm but
[2:14:36] what about the storms in your life this
[2:14:38] morning he came so that you would have a
[2:14:40] way back so that you would have
[2:14:42] Fellowship so that you would be on
[2:14:44] speaking terms again so that you like
[2:14:46] Adam in the garden could look at that
[2:14:47] wind of sickness in your life that wind
[2:14:49] of turmoil in your family and you can
[2:14:51] stand there and put your shoulders back
[2:14:52] as a redeemed son or daughter of the
[2:14:54] Living God and say peace be still and
[2:14:58] the winds have to calm down the storm
[2:15:00] has to calm down and the Seas have to
[2:15:02] become calm he came to show that that's
[2:15:05] how man could
[2:15:06] operate and he came into this atmosphere
[2:15:09] that was cut out that had been cut off
[2:15:11] from the Heavens to do battle against
[2:15:14] the enemy to do battle against spiritual
[2:15:17] wickedness and high
[2:15:19] places and this is what I came into as I
[2:15:21] was studying about atmospheres and it
[2:15:22] just thrilled my heart maybe it's just
[2:15:24] common knowledge to everybody and and I
[2:15:26] don't know but I just never seen it like
[2:15:28] this
[2:15:29] before yes he came to conquer sin and he
[2:15:31] came to conquer death hell in the grave
[2:15:34] but there's a piece that we often
[2:15:36] Overlook brother brandham says the
[2:15:39] Ascension is not talked about
[2:15:41] enough he says he came to conquer
[2:15:44] atmospheres and all the evil that was
[2:15:46] there so that you once again could
[2:15:49] return to Heavenly places and have
[2:15:51] access to the heavens once again so that
[2:15:55] your prayers could go up before God and
[2:15:57] so that his answers could come down to
[2:15:59] you he said there's so little spoke of
[2:16:01] this Ascension it's one of the greatest
[2:16:03] days when he ascended up cuz all over
[2:16:06] the Earth since the day in the Garden of
[2:16:08] Eden that sin was committed all Heavens
[2:16:10] was shut off from mankind when he was on
[2:16:12] the earth he conquered passions Pride he
[2:16:15] conquered sickness he conquered Devils
[2:16:17] but when he died he conquered death when
[2:16:19] he arose he conquered hell and when he
[2:16:21] went up and he conquered everything that
[2:16:23] was against mankind it then went into
[2:16:25] the wine press of God and crushed it
[2:16:27] down and conquered death hell grave
[2:16:30] sickness formalities everything else and
[2:16:33] overcome it all and Rose on the third
[2:16:36] day and conquered all the atmospheres
[2:16:39] above and he cut the Mist between God
[2:16:41] and man and he connected Heaven to Earth
[2:16:44] again glory to God once again man was
[2:16:48] connected he ripped through the
[2:16:49] atmospheres he ripped through the demons
[2:16:52] and he made a highway as he went back up
[2:16:55] past the moon passed Mar through the
[2:16:57] Milky Way he tore through the atmosphere
[2:16:59] of
[2:17:00] [Applause]
[2:17:02] devils he said and as they went out he
[2:17:05] conquered the grave then there was a
[2:17:07] great Mist hanging over the Earth yet so
[2:17:09] he had to conquer that mist of sin that
[2:17:11] mist of stench of the sins of the people
[2:17:14] and with his own blood his vesture
[2:17:16] dipped in blood he conquered the
[2:17:18] atmosphere above Blessed Be His holy
[2:17:21] name he cut the fogs of Hell from place
[2:17:23] to place until he cut a whole through
[2:17:26] the sky Adam's lost children could pray
[2:17:29] through to Victory he conquered the
[2:17:32] atmospheres he conquered sin he
[2:17:34] conquered death he conquered hell and he
[2:17:37] rose
[2:17:39] triumphant Hallelujah Satan sit there
[2:17:42] and says you don't have a right you
[2:17:43] don't have a right to come into Heavenly
[2:17:45] atmospheres you don't have a right oh I
[2:17:47] do Satan there was a mighty conqueror
[2:17:50] and he rose through the atmosphere and
[2:17:52] he tore your hold upon it you may be the
[2:17:55] prince of the power of the air but I
[2:17:57] have a right to say peace be still I
[2:17:59] have a right to worship here I have a
[2:18:01] right to live here I have a right to
[2:18:03] abide here Jesus Made A
[2:18:07] Way Hallelujah Hall he conquered
[2:18:14] atmospheres no man can see the glory of
[2:18:17] God
[2:18:20] no man can
[2:18:22] understand the glories of God was shut
[2:18:24] off the powers was shut off Fellowship
[2:18:29] was shut off but our
[2:18:32] conqueror tore through the midst of
[2:18:34] demons tore through the fog of demons
[2:18:37] and granted us access to Heaven once
[2:18:39] again granted us access to God once
[2:18:42] again he ripped the veil of
[2:18:46] atmospheres and paved the way not only
[2:18:48] for us to be able to sit in Heavenly
[2:18:51] places
[2:18:54] now but he paved a highway cuz he knew
[2:18:57] one of these days I got a bride
[2:19:01] coming how she going to go he made a way
[2:19:05] he paved a highway he listen we couldn't
[2:19:07] have went up before the atmosphere was
[2:19:09] conquered no man ascended up that's what
[2:19:12] the scripture says we couldn't Ascend up
[2:19:13] we couldn't go there it was clogged with
[2:19:16] demons and torments but he said I got a
[2:19:18] bride coming and she's going to come up
[2:19:20] through the atmosphere she's going to
[2:19:22] rise up to meet me in the air and so he
[2:19:24] tore a highway and he marked it well
[2:19:26] with his own blood and he said this is
[2:19:28] the way this is the way rise to meet me
[2:19:31] little
[2:19:33] bride brother Brown says the Bible said
[2:19:35] he ascended on high and gave gifts unto
[2:19:37] men there was an atmosphere hung over
[2:19:39] the Earth of Darkness of Gloom of death
[2:19:41] and weary the prayers couldn't come up
[2:19:45] because the atonement wasn't made but he
[2:19:48] broke through that Veil and he opened up
[2:19:51] the
[2:19:53] way the atmosphere may be full of demons
[2:19:55] this morning church it may be full of
[2:19:58] devils but there is a Highway made right
[2:20:01] through it all there is a Highway in the
[2:20:04] glory and one of these mornings when the
[2:20:06] trumpet
[2:20:08] sounds one of these mornings with the
[2:20:10] trumpet sounds we're going to gather
[2:20:11] with our Mighty conqueror think about
[2:20:14] this now it's just me I liked it
[2:20:17] right there in the place that Satan
[2:20:20] supposedly controls right there in the
[2:20:22] place that he laid claim to right there
[2:20:25] where he blockaded all men where he had
[2:20:28] wared with angels where he had blocked
[2:20:31] our blessings you say blocked our
[2:20:33] blessings yeah brother brandham says all
[2:20:37] the sins that's in Heaven above he is
[2:20:39] the prince of the power of the air he
[2:20:41] keeps off the blessings from
[2:20:44] God in there comes Thunderbolts of
[2:20:46] lightning and strikes the Earth and
[2:20:48] everything from the heavens Sheets of
[2:20:49] slicey Rain typhoons storms and
[2:20:51] everything comes from above which is
[2:20:53] Satan the prince of the power there look
[2:20:56] we saw this in Daniel we saw this in the
[2:20:58] Book of Daniel 10 where he had to wait
[2:21:00] 21 days because the the the prince of
[2:21:03] the power of Persia battled the angel to
[2:21:06] keep him from getting to
[2:21:07] Daniel Satan has laid claim to those
[2:21:10] atmospheres for years and years and
[2:21:12] years and yet Jesus made a way that we
[2:21:14] can make a claim to them because they
[2:21:16] rightfully belong to us and he says in 1
[2:21:19] Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself
[2:21:22] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[2:21:24] with the voice of the Archangel and with
[2:21:26] the Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[2:21:28] shall rise first then we which are alive
[2:21:31] and remain shall be caught up together
[2:21:32] with them in the clouds and meet the
[2:21:35] Lord in the air and so we shall ever be
[2:21:38] with the Lord it shows it's been
[2:21:40] reconquered it shows that we have a
[2:21:42] right to it it shows that that's a place
[2:21:44] that we can operate from live in abide
[2:21:46] in we can listen listen we're called to
[2:21:48] Rise Above This layot toan atmosphere
[2:21:50] you're called to rise above that
[2:21:51] depression that's holding you down
[2:21:53] you're called to rise above that anxiety
[2:21:55] you're called to a Heavenly atmosphere
[2:21:57] and he paved the way just walk up the
[2:21:59] King's Highway this morning just rise
[2:22:02] above it a little bit this morning and
[2:22:04] Fight for Your god-given
[2:22:07] Atmosphere because now we have a
[2:22:09] right we have a
[2:22:12] right yes it is the atmosphere of the
[2:22:15] end time but we can sit in Heavenly
[2:22:18] places and live in an atmosphere of the
[2:22:21] Holy Ghost to where our lives are not
[2:22:23] dictated by that
[2:22:27] atmosphere I'm G skip some of this now
[2:22:29] as I as I as I bring this
[2:22:33] down brother brandham taught us very
[2:22:36] clearly that it's atmosphere that does
[2:22:40] it it's worth fighting
[2:22:43] for every service every devotion at home
[2:22:46] every moment conquer the atmosphere
[2:22:48] around you fight for the right
[2:22:50] atmosphere around you he says well
[2:22:54] that's what the word of God is if you
[2:22:56] take any promise of God and place it in
[2:22:58] the right atmosphere it'll
[2:23:01] produce exactly what it is in its
[2:23:06] life we will get and I'm going to bring
[2:23:09] this down and and yes I'm talking about
[2:23:10] your life and not just Sunday Wednesday
[2:23:12] but I'm going to bring this down to
[2:23:13] service for just a minute we will get we
[2:23:16] will receive
[2:23:19] what we get based off the atmosphere we
[2:23:23] create you say brother I disagree it's
[2:23:25] the word that does these things it's the
[2:23:28] word that we got to have true we must
[2:23:30] have the word but it must be placed in
[2:23:32] the right atmosphere in order to produce
[2:23:34] what that word promised listen to
[2:23:36] brother brandom
[2:23:38] here this this was amazing to me he said
[2:23:41] what difference does that make I don't
[2:23:43] care how many nails you got how many
[2:23:45] pieces AC cross you got we need to
[2:23:47] produce this word again amen put it on a
[2:23:52] cross on a nail not on a cross or on a
[2:23:55] nail but on the living atmosphere of the
[2:23:57] holy spirit that brings forth the
[2:23:59] results God's word under the right
[2:24:02] atmosphere will produce exactly what it
[2:24:04] says it'll do it's got to be in the
[2:24:06] right atmosphere though you can't lay it
[2:24:08] over in the Seminary or some Bible
[2:24:10] school that don't believe in signs and
[2:24:12] wonders it'll never happen amen so you
[2:24:15] take this exact word
[2:24:17] and you place it somewhere that don't
[2:24:19] believe in it and it has no
[2:24:23] power well those things never happen in
[2:24:26] our
[2:24:27] church well
[2:24:29] know you don't believe in it well we do
[2:24:32] believe it well brother brandham says
[2:24:36] that the atmosphere of the church will
[2:24:37] be what is
[2:24:40] preached so if you believe it preach it
[2:24:44] but you lay it in a place that has no
[2:24:47] atmosphere it will do
[2:24:50] nothing he says it's got to be in the
[2:24:52] right atmosphere you can't lay it over
[2:24:53] in the Seminary it'll never happen it'll
[2:24:55] never break forth and bring life there
[2:24:58] the atmosphere is wrong you got to put
[2:25:01] it in the right atmosphere so listen he
[2:25:05] says we can't have a healing service
[2:25:07] until people get in the spirit of a
[2:25:09] healing
[2:25:10] service
[2:25:13] yes we can't have a filling of the Holy
[2:25:16] Ghost until people get in that kind of
[2:25:19] atmosphere so
[2:25:21] apparently there is a that kind of
[2:25:24] atmosphere that goes along with people
[2:25:26] getting filled with the Holy
[2:25:32] Ghost and the people was in the
[2:25:34] atmosphere in that day to bring judgment
[2:25:36] upon the Earth and they're in the same
[2:25:38] atmosphere
[2:25:40] today I'm going to read this quote it's
[2:25:42] a little long he says they was blessing
[2:25:44] God for the Holy Ghost he's talking
[2:25:45] about the day of Pentecost Why didn't it
[2:25:47] come
[2:25:49] sooner which had never come yet but they
[2:25:52] believed that it was because God was
[2:25:54] going to keep his promise and when they
[2:25:56] kept blessing God until the atmosphere
[2:25:59] got right then there came from heaven
[2:26:02] like a rushing Mighty Wind and filled
[2:26:04] all the house that were sitting there
[2:26:06] see the atmosphere got right oh could we
[2:26:10] get an atmosphere here that every
[2:26:13] crippled every blind every sick person
[2:26:16] everything all with one Accord believing
[2:26:19] he said I seen it just last week in Wood
[2:26:21] River where there wasn't a person left
[2:26:23] they just piled up the crutches and
[2:26:24] Wheelchairs and CS I was standing at the
[2:26:26] platform preaching like this and they
[2:26:28] just begin to raise up and throw them in
[2:26:29] the corner why the
[2:26:32] atmosphere got
[2:26:35] right what would happen if we would come
[2:26:38] together in every service determined to
[2:26:41] get the atmosphere
[2:26:42] right determined to do my part not
[2:26:45] worried about what other people listen
[2:26:46] listen I can't worry if you're not
[2:26:48] worshiping I can't worry if you're
[2:26:50] worshiping really loud as a matter of
[2:26:52] fact I shouldn't worry what you're doing
[2:26:54] any at all when it comes to worship now
[2:26:57] when it comes to standing here it's a
[2:26:58] little different it's difficult to not
[2:27:01] worry about it when you're asleep on
[2:27:06] me but when it comes to worship it's my
[2:27:09] job to worry about my
[2:27:12] worship and if I will just be determined
[2:27:14] to do my part cuz I know when I come I
[2:27:17] know he's going to try to hinder I know
[2:27:19] he's going to try to fight I know it's
[2:27:21] not always going to be easy but we have
[2:27:23] to remember we are the creators of
[2:27:25] atmospheres and we have a right to sit
[2:27:28] in Heavenly places we have a right to
[2:27:31] the things written in the word of God we
[2:27:33] have a right to the power of God moving
[2:27:35] in our midst we have a right to worship
[2:27:37] Him in spirit and truth and if the
[2:27:40] atmosphere is what brings on the
[2:27:42] supernatural then why wouldn't we want
[2:27:44] to do everything within our power to
[2:27:45] create a super natural atmosphere every
[2:27:48] single time we come together and make
[2:27:51] sure the atmosphere gets
[2:27:54] right brother brand says what we need is
[2:27:56] a holy ghost atmosphere that's right an
[2:27:59] atmosphere where the power of God's
[2:28:00] moving one Accord one place gathered
[2:28:03] together under that atmosphere of
[2:28:05] expecting God to move down and do signs
[2:28:07] and wonders amen let's move ourselves
[2:28:11] up now for the people that think this is
[2:28:13] Elementary brother Bram says it's moving
[2:28:15] up but because that atmosphere is now
[2:28:17] available to us he says let's move
[2:28:20] ourselves up into that bracket so an
[2:28:23] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost an
[2:28:24] atmosphere of signs and wonders and
[2:28:26] shouting and tongues and prophecies is a
[2:28:28] move upen he said let's move ourselves
[2:28:32] up into that bracket Step Up in faith
[2:28:36] move out of these three dimensions up
[2:28:39] into that next one say Lord I'm just
[2:28:43] believing you're going to pour out your
[2:28:44] blessings I'm expecting it now all
[2:28:47] things are moving right in and I'm
[2:28:48] expecting to see exceedingly abundantly
[2:28:50] now I'm expecting it you come down and
[2:28:53] say now listen you come down and say
[2:28:57] well I don't know about it he goes right
[2:28:59] from that to but you come down and say
[2:29:01] well I don't know about does that sound
[2:29:03] super
[2:29:04] negative that's not awful that's not
[2:29:06] like saying well that's just a bunch of
[2:29:09] workup well that's not right that wasn't
[2:29:13] the spirit now that's harsh but he says
[2:29:15] you're just sitting there going
[2:29:17] I don't really know about it well you
[2:29:20] see you've hurt the other person
[2:29:29] right well you see you've hurt the other
[2:29:34] person because it's a battle for
[2:29:38] atmosphere you just put a Log on the
[2:29:41] Fire of
[2:29:43] negativity and now it's burning a little
[2:29:45] brighter next to the other person
[2:29:47] who was trying to push through who was
[2:29:49] trying to fight into that atmosphere and
[2:29:51] Break Forth but your little seed of
[2:29:54] Doubt was an
[2:29:58] anchor the atmosphere you create right
[2:30:02] now just judge yourself judge yourself
[2:30:04] right here or in any service it either
[2:30:08] benefits the service or hinders there's
[2:30:11] no such thing as in between there's no
[2:30:13] such thing as I was just an observer
[2:30:15] well then You Hinder the
[2:30:17] service I'm sorry that's just that's how
[2:30:20] it is this has nothing to do with how
[2:30:22] I'm natured how I'm this you know good
[2:30:24] and well I don't believe that every
[2:30:25] single person has a run jump dance Shout
[2:30:27] Scream the top of lung that's not what
[2:30:28] I'm asking you to do but did you enter
[2:30:30] in that's what I'm talking about did you
[2:30:33] enter
[2:30:36] in I I didn't today you hindered the
[2:30:40] service I understand you had a bad day I
[2:30:43] get it why did you have to put your bad
[2:30:45] day on all of us
[2:30:53] amen because you have the power right
[2:30:57] now in this moment in this service to
[2:31:00] transform the atmosphere around
[2:31:03] you out of chaos came an Eden because he
[2:31:06] was the creator and now that Creator is
[2:31:09] on the inside of you and you have the
[2:31:12] power to create personal a personal
[2:31:14] atmosphere that welcomes God now
[2:31:17] multiply that personal Atmosphere by
[2:31:19] 250 what kind of atmosphere could we
[2:31:21] create in this building right in the
[2:31:23] middle of Leota a Heavenly atmosphere we
[2:31:27] could truly sit together in Heavenly
[2:31:29] places as God moves however he sees fit
[2:31:33] through an atmosphere that welcomes him
[2:31:35] that pulled on the word what's that mean
[2:31:37] I pulled on the word I pulled on Jesus
[2:31:39] to come to my Pew that's what it means
[2:31:42] well I'm not really a
[2:31:45] puller today's a good time to
[2:31:49] start you know I I didn't really get
[2:31:51] spoke to today did you pull it out of
[2:31:53] the man of
[2:31:57] God
[2:31:58] you operate the
[2:32:02] gift by pulling for the needs that you
[2:32:06] have I never get anything you never
[2:32:10] pull you talking about me no I'm talking
[2:32:13] about whoever that hit between the eyes
[2:32:15] I don't I don't know who it
[2:32:18] is I have no
[2:32:20] idea but I say let's get the atmosphere
[2:32:23] right in our homes let's fight for the
[2:32:25] right atmosphere in our services let's
[2:32:27] fight for the right atmosphere around us
[2:32:29] that other people recognize they've
[2:32:30] stepped into something different we
[2:32:32] didn't even go into the that this time
[2:32:34] brother Brown deals with individual
[2:32:35] atmospheres maybe at another time but
[2:32:37] you have the ability for people to know
[2:32:39] you're different by the atmosphere that
[2:32:42] you live in in an atmosphere where where
[2:32:44] where people accuse and demons Rule and
[2:32:47] demons ACC accuse and they
[2:32:49] influence when troubles come into the
[2:32:52] church I'm going rise above that
[2:32:54] atmosphere I'mma change that atmosphere
[2:32:57] when gossip and unbelief come in I'm
[2:32:59] going to change that atmosphere when
[2:33:01] Satan tries to come and make us cold and
[2:33:03] formal I'm going to change that
[2:33:06] atmosphere I'm not going to stand for it
[2:33:08] because look it don't we're in Louisiana
[2:33:10] it don't take but a little cold front to
[2:33:11] mess things up you know they say natural
[2:33:13] types of spiritual so I'm just going
[2:33:15] there
[2:33:17] we had one day of cold in the world shut
[2:33:19] down I know it SED a little bit I'm
[2:33:22] thinking we might get to stay home a
[2:33:24] day my kids homeschool poor kids Public
[2:33:28] Schools got out for a week I gave them
[2:33:31] Monday you can safely get from your bed
[2:33:33] to the
[2:33:36] [Applause]
[2:33:43] classroom going to be no trouble here
[2:33:46] but what's my point you let the
[2:33:48] atmosphere change a little bit let the
[2:33:50] roads get a little icy and all of a
[2:33:51] sudden we're all froze over we're all
[2:33:54] stuck at home life changes we ain't
[2:33:57] moving but then let the sun start to
[2:33:59] shine again Hey listen if you froze up a
[2:34:01] little bit the sun's out this morning if
[2:34:03] you've been froze for a little while the
[2:34:05] sun's out this morning it's time to Tha
[2:34:07] out a little bit it's time to work those

[2:34:19] going to cry out to God I'm going to
[2:34:21] praise him I'm going to worship him I
[2:34:23] say create an atmosphere in even light
[2:34:25] Tabernacle where the devil ain't welcome
[2:34:27] where cancer flees where sickness flees
[2:34:30] where bondage is Loos into freedom and
[2:34:33] Eden comes forth in your life create a
[2:34:36] Heavenly
[2:34:38] atmosphere where all things are possible
[2:34:41] just give praise to God Heavenly Father

[2:35:27] mighty God he's a promis keeper he said
[2:35:31] I'll never leave you or forsake you it's
[2:35:32] the worst atmosphere that's ever been he
[2:35:34] hasn't left us he's still on the inside
[2:35:37] of you saying there can be an Eden in
[2:35:38] your heart there can be an Eden around
[2:35:41] you oh when we create the right
[2:35:43] atmosphere and he begins to move thank
[2:35:46] then all things are possible if you can
[2:35:48] get the people to
[2:35:50] believe then not even cancer will stand
[2:35:52] before you that's the kind of people we
[2:35:55] are but it takes the atmosphere there is
[2:35:57] special atmospheres for special
[2:35:59] situations for special needs he said it
[2:36:00] you want healing getting a healing
[2:36:03] atmosphere what do you think happened
[2:36:05] when the pool of Bethesda was

[2:49:35] believing we got brother
[2:49:41] Ron with this
[2:49:43] report
[2:49:45] and we're not here to bring fear or
[2:49:47] preach fear but I think you understand
[2:49:49] how
[2:49:51] serious where we're at
[2:49:55] is this is the moment we talked about
[2:49:58] end times and the and this is the
[2:50:02] moment to where God has to
[2:50:06] intercede that's where we
[2:50:11] [Music]
[2:50:13] are and just for a moment I want you to
[2:50:16] think about the times that he's fought
[2:50:18] for your young
[2:50:21] people that he's fought for
[2:50:25] you that he stood in this pull pit I've
[2:50:28] been right there with him getting ready
[2:50:29] to come out and he says take me out the
[2:50:31] back door and he walks out and pukes
[2:50:32] seven times as they're calling him up
[2:50:35] wipe his mouth and come to the pull pit
[2:50:37] and preach under the anointing and the
[2:50:39] power of
[2:50:41] God right
[2:50:43] now I want you to consecrate your
[2:50:46] thinking to consecrate your mind lay
[2:50:49] everything else
[2:50:51] aside and we're going to show what I
[2:50:53] believe happens when you get in the
[2:50:55] right
[2:50:56] atmosphere we're going to have brother
[2:50:58] Joe lead
[2:51:00] us in
[2:51:02] prayer and yes it's for brother Ron but
[2:51:04] it's also for you aun jeie same
[2:51:08] demon she's in a desperate condition too
[2:51:11] anybody with cancer is in a desperate
[2:51:13] condition
[2:51:18] but I want you to
[2:51:19] pray I don't want them just to hear Joe
[2:51:22] Adams on the recording May the voices of
[2:51:24] the saints of God at evening like
[2:51:25] Tabernacle ring into the heavens into
[2:51:28] the atmospheres that Christ made a way
[2:51:29] for us to enter into he did it so
[2:51:31] prayers like this could go up so that
[2:51:34] answers like healing could come
[2:51:37] down in this moment in this time will
[2:51:40] you pray with
[2:51:42] us for brother Ron
[2:51:53] amen I sent this to brother Tim this
[2:51:55] morning as he was preparing to go forth
[2:51:57] and to
[2:51:58] preach there with the Believers at
[2:52:00] brother Ron's church I said draw your
[2:52:02] sword and fight like you never fought
[2:52:05] before if you know anything about
[2:52:07] brother Tim he's got a fighting Spirit
[2:52:10] he's a man that believes this word with
[2:52:12] his entire heart and because of who he
[2:52:15] is and because of how he
[2:52:17] preaches each of us has been endued with
[2:52:20] that same Spirit to never give up to
[2:52:24] never walk away from the battle I said
[2:52:28] you've been called for this hour and
[2:52:30] you've been anointed for this
[2:52:32] [Music]
[2:52:33] purpose cut your way through the victory
[2:52:36] for the Spencer
[2:52:38] family and cut your way through the
[2:52:40] victory for the family of God each of
[2:52:44] you here today has a
[2:52:46] need it may not be cancer but may be a
[2:52:49] loved one it may be a son it may be a
[2:52:52] daughter of God I counted over 20
[2:52:54] prodical the other day that should be
[2:52:56] sitting in the house of God each of you
[2:52:58] have your own battle you just heard
[2:53:00] about creating an atmosphere where the
[2:53:02] presence of God can come
[2:53:05] down and each of you today have a sword
[2:53:08] that God has placed in your hand and I'm
[2:53:11] going to ask you David I'm going to ask
[2:53:14] you sons of God will you draw your sword
[2:53:16] this morning will you cut your way
[2:53:18] through the victory this morning will
[2:53:20] you do that this morning then I believe
[2:53:22] we as a Church of the Living God the
[2:53:26] church even light Tabernacle God has
[2:53:29] endued us God has place within the ranks
[2:53:32] of this church the atmosphere that the
[2:53:35] supernatural can come down and miracles
[2:53:38] can take place he's still the god of
[2:53:40] impossibilities he's still the god that
[2:53:43] heals he's still that God that deliver
[2:53:45] us and father God today Lord we're
[2:53:48] believing for the impossible God to
[2:53:51] report say it's over the reports say
[2:53:53] it's no use the reports say that cancer
[2:53:56] is dropped down and come from his brain
[2:53:58] back into his eyes but God we're not
[2:54:00] looking at the reports this morning God
