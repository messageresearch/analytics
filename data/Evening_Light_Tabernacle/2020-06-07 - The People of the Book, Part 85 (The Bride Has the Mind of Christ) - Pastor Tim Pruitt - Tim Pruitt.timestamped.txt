[44:50] will just meet that need whatever that
[44:53] you have a man we're just pray that
[44:56] he'll just come today in a mighty way
[44:58] for your life amen god bless you thank
[45:01] you let's let's turn to Philippians 2
[45:04] and verse 5 I want to go there again
[45:07] this morning as there are some things
[45:10] that I would like to share here about
[45:13] the mind of Christ and today we're going
[45:15] to be speaking of the bride has the mind
[45:18] of Christ now want you just to really
[45:21] tune in today and pray for me as you are
[45:25] tuning in just asking God does that give
[45:28] your brother Tim the utterance that is
[45:30] needed to minister life to us through
[45:35] the word and I want you to look look
[45:38] past what you see a man I want you to
[45:43] look into the unseen so I want you to
[45:46] look past what you what you see
[45:47] everything that you see that is going on
[45:50] in the world and then the problems that
[45:52] you're facing right now I want you to
[45:54] look past it look beyond that
[45:57] see something that is greater that is
[45:59] actually happening and I want you to
[46:02] think past your thinking I want you to
[46:06] go way beyond what you've been thinking
[46:07] until you can you can think as he thinks
[46:12] I'm an exceeding above abundantly above
[46:16] what you are able to think our ask and
[46:19] get into the mind of God because the
[46:22] bride has the mind of Christ and that's
[46:24] what we're speaking on this morning is
[46:27] the my bride has the mind of Christ
[46:29] Philippians 2 and verse 5 let this mind
[46:32] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[46:36] who being in the form of God thought it
[46:39] not robbery to be equal with God but
[46:41] made himself of no reputation and took
[46:44] upon him the form of a servant and was
[46:47] made in the likeness of men and being
[46:48] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[46:51] himself and became obedient unto death
[46:54] even the death of the cross amens of the
[46:58] mind that was in Christ brought him into
[47:01] obedience to the will of God amen
[47:04] so when we're saying let this mind being
[47:07] us let it bring us in humility humbling
[47:10] down to the will of God for our lives
[47:12] and for this day this age that we're
[47:15] living in because we have a word to
[47:17] fulfill god bless you can be seated
[47:19] we've been speaking now for nearly two
[47:23] years upon the people of the book we've
[47:27] titled you know went through a lot of
[47:29] different teams as we have done and that
[47:32] we started with this thought of the
[47:33] people of the book have returned to the
[47:35] land of the book and and today we're
[47:39] going to take it into in this land the
[47:43] the bride has the mind of Christ and
[47:46] that's that's where we are in this time
[47:50] where that the mind of Christ has been
[47:53] revealed to a generation two people in
[47:57] this last day to prepare her for the
[48:00] rapture of the church and and so even
[48:04] when God made man and and created even
[48:08] the animal world he made them all
[48:11] spirits but only man he gave a soul and
[48:16] in the soul there is a conscience and
[48:20] and so it it almost makes us too
[48:24] where that we are a dual creature that
[48:27] we are one born of heaven and yet we're
[48:30] living in a body that has been born of
[48:33] the earth so it makes us makes us of a
[48:37] dual dual creature in in some ways of
[48:41] dual nature and that we're still human
[48:44] but yet we are born sons of God and and
[48:49] so we within our soul there is a
[48:53] consciousness which brother branham
[48:57] would call the sub-conscience now in the
[49:00] subconscious he would explain even his
[49:03] visions was like this he said that he
[49:08] said like when you go to sleep and you
[49:10] dream he said now that's part of you
[49:12] somewhere and and he said many times
[49:16] it's things that you were thinking about
[49:19] that happened to me last night I drove a
[49:22] drove by brother Timothy's garden and I
[49:24] saw his beans said were there and
[49:27] knowing he's away from home and and the
[49:30] beans are probably on the vines I
[49:33] couldn't see them but just come and buy
[49:35] them I was thinking you know della those
[49:38] probably need to be picked and you know
[49:41] they're they're probably coming to the
[49:42] point of fruition and so they're you
[49:45] know during the night I dream about the
[49:48] beans and and some of them are overripe
[49:51] and we're having to shell them and you
[49:53] know like that because they had went too
[49:55] long it was a result of my subconscious
[49:58] mind in the night but it was a part of
[50:02] me somewhere right and so brother
[50:06] branham said about his visions he said
[50:09] the visions he says you don't dream he
[50:12] said it's like a dream he said you see
[50:14] it and of course some dreams are from
[50:16] God and so again he said some people
[50:20] don't dream at all and he said your your
[50:22] subconscious as far as from here to the
[50:24] wall but other people their there their
[50:27] subconscious is closer and God can deal
[50:30] in that sub-conscience
[50:32] and even give spiritual dreams and
[50:35] dreams that will mean things for years
[50:37] to come
[50:38] you know I've I've had I've had that
[50:41] many of those like that that that have
[50:44] come to very very true very come to pass
[50:48] exactly I remember you know the Lord
[50:52] sometimes just gives them to you just
[50:53] for his His grace to help you to deal
[51:00] with a situation that he knows you're
[51:02] gonna deal with I remember when I was
[51:04] raised in rat terriers for example you
[51:08] know I had a little dog there that I
[51:11] bought him and I had some puppies that
[51:13] were expected to be born and so I had to
[51:18] go away in preach and so I'd called home
[51:20] several times about Maya but about the
[51:24] dog and you know checked on it and even
[51:27] called that morning before I got on the
[51:29] plane how is that how is that dog you
[51:31] know it's fine
[51:32] everything's okay and and but but I'd
[51:36] had a dream that night and I dreamed us
[51:39] coming in and I walked from the car
[51:42] directly to the box were that the the
[51:46] dog would the kennel that it was in
[51:47] lifted up the lid and looked down and
[51:50] there was the dog laying there dead and
[51:53] a puppy laying right beside it dead and
[51:56] so you know I had that dream so I called
[51:59] whoa check on this dog and when I got a
[52:02] home I I walked right in and as I did I
[52:05] walked straight to the kennel and
[52:07] straight to the box and there the dog
[52:09] was laying there dead and the puppy
[52:11] exactly as I'd seen it in the dream now
[52:14] you see sometimes those are when a dream
[52:19] like that comes to pass is actually a
[52:21] vision that happens in your
[52:22] sub-conscience it's the same as a vision
[52:25] and and some are gifted that way in
[52:29] order to because he said that in the
[52:31] last days I will pour out my spirit upon
[52:34] all flesh and he said old men will dream
[52:37] dreams and young men will see visions
[52:38] and so brother Bantam said about a
[52:42] vision he said now your sub-conscience
[52:44] is right here and the and he said
[52:47] they're together and he said you're
[52:48] standing away you're not
[52:50] sleep but in a vision you're awake and
[52:53] your sub-conscience right here and
[52:55] you're actually watching things that has
[52:57] happened in the past and it's as though
[53:00] they're present and you're hearing
[53:02] voices you're seeing things that are
[53:04] even in the future and that all happens
[53:07] he says in the sub-conscience
[53:09] round and so you know that that was
[53:13] again showing us the mind of Christ was
[53:17] here and that it is coming so close that
[53:21] we even see with the prophets ministry
[53:24] it was so close that he could even be
[53:26] awake and recognize things that were
[53:31] happening in the spirit round is
[53:34] everybody with me now and of course it
[53:37] is also a sign to us that Christ is here
[53:42] because only Christ can discern the
[53:45] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[53:48] and so he is here he was in the farm of
[53:51] the word because the word knows the
[53:54] thoughts and intents of heart and can
[53:55] divide the asunder between the soul and
[53:57] the spirit so it was identifying that
[54:00] the word was here but yet I'm at the
[54:03] same time it shows us that Christ is
[54:06] here in bride form that that was his
[54:10] mind working among us now again when we
[54:15] have the message as I preached last
[54:17] Sunday and we received the opening of
[54:20] the seals that was the mind of Christ
[54:22] that was being revealed to us God
[54:26] thinking not a theologian not a man's
[54:29] idea or theologians interpretation but
[54:34] God's own mind that being Express to an
[54:37] age in this day through a seer a prophet
[54:40] whose sub-conscience could be right here
[54:43] and he can't be in that round while
[54:45] standing in this realm at the same time
[54:48] now again but but when we talk about
[54:52] that we we also know that the man who is
[54:57] unconverted
[54:58] his sub-conscience is also there but he
[55:02] it is tainted with that which is evil
[55:06] I'd like to go with it wouldn't you to
[55:08] go with me to Genesis 6 and 5 because
[55:11] the unconverted man is led by what he
[55:15] sees and his senses declare that now
[55:20] Genesis 6 and 5 and God saw the
[55:23] wickedness of man was great in the earth
[55:26] and every imagination of the thoughts of
[55:30] his heart was only evil continually so
[55:35] now we're going to look at here because
[55:37] right here in a time where the mind of
[55:40] Christ is being poured out we also see
[55:42] the mind of Satan is being poured out
[55:46] because we are again as it was in the
[55:49] days of Noah where God destroyed the
[55:51] earth the first time because the
[55:54] wickedness of man was great in the earth
[55:56] and every imagination and his thoughts
[55:58] of his heart was only evil continually
[56:00] if you look with me to Genesis 8:21
[56:03] we'll will read this portion for the
[56:05] imagination of man's heart is evil from
[56:09] his youth so now here again if you look
[56:15] here we're just taking that portion out
[56:16] the imagination of man's heart this is
[56:19] after the blood is evil from his youth
[56:24] so there is an inherent nature of evil
[56:28] of darkness that we receive by our first
[56:31] birth and this is what we must die to
[56:35] and we must be born again
[56:37] now again Jesus agreed with him sin
[56:40] Matthew 15:19 for out of the heart
[56:43] notice yes out of the heart that's where
[56:46] the that sub-conscience lays proceedeth
[56:50] on evil thoughts murders and adulteries
[56:54] fornications thefts false witness
[56:57] blasphemies these are the things which
[57:00] defile a man so notice again out of the
[57:05] heart proceedeth evil thoughts murders
[57:08] adulteries fornications thefts false
[57:12] witnesses and blasphemies and again the
[57:15] because there is an anointing that has
[57:18] come down even to anoint the evil
[57:21] passions of men in this last day as
[57:24] Satan is about to become incarnate in
[57:27] the people are you with me Amen now but
[57:31] at the same time God is becoming
[57:34] incarnate in his church and they will
[57:37] have the mind of Christ so now the new
[57:41] birth removes sin nature that defiles a
[57:44] man and it places in him the mind of
[57:48] Christ
[57:49] so the born-again man walks by faith and
[57:52] not by sight
[57:54] now that scripture right now you know
[57:57] brother Branham taught it this way when
[57:59] God made a man he said God chose his
[58:02] heart but he said the devil took his
[58:05] head now so again every time that God
[58:09] comes to redeem he comes to the heart
[58:13] amen to change the heart not just your
[58:16] thinking but your heart now so again he
[58:20] says he says God chose his heart and the
[58:23] devil took his head the devil through
[58:25] imagination makes him imagine anything
[58:28] and gives him
[58:31] intellectual conceptions of the
[58:33] scripture so now makes him imagine
[58:37] anything plus on the religious side
[58:41] distorts the scriptures to where it's
[58:44] only an intellectual thinking it's not a
[58:48] work within the heart I'd like to turn
[58:52] to something 92 and 5 and let's just see
[58:55] this scripture because it says O Lord
[58:58] how great are thy works and thy thoughts
[59:02] are very deep hallelujah amen how
[59:08] greater that works and our thoughts are
[59:10] very deep a brutish man knoweth not
[59:15] neither does a fool understand this so
[59:19] again another translation says the
[59:22] spiritually insensitive do not recognize
[59:25] this the fool does not understand this
[59:28] and of course you know in sums fourteen
[59:31] and one it is the fool that is said in
[59:34] his heart there is no God and they are
[59:37] corrupt and they have done abominable
[59:39] works and there is none that doeth good
[59:43] here's good
[59:44] here's the condition of the depravity of
[59:47] man and man and a lost condition he says
[59:51] they are corrupt they have done
[59:52] abominable works there is none that
[59:55] doeth good the Lord look at them from
[59:58] heaven upon the children of men to see
[1:00:01] if there were any that did understand
[1:00:04] and seek God and there are they are all
[1:00:08] gone aside they are all together become
[1:00:12] filthy and there is none that doeth good
[1:00:14] no not one this is condition of sinful
[1:00:21] man that's why you have to be born again
[1:00:25] to see or understand the kingdom of God
[1:00:30] because his thoughts are very deep and
[1:00:35] the wicked cannot understand it those
[1:00:38] that are born again will never
[1:00:39] understand the kingdom of God unless
[1:00:42] you're born again hey man now so you see
[1:00:47] those there again God gets in his heart
[1:00:51] and leads him by the spirit and makes
[1:00:53] him believe things that his intellectual
[1:00:55] knows nothing about because the message
[1:01:00] cannot be passed on intellectually and
[1:01:02] the new birth cannot happen
[1:01:04] intellectually it must be a change on
[1:01:08] the inside of the inside now
[1:01:12] when you were saved brother Branham said
[1:01:14] God gives you faith to rise above the
[1:01:16] muck of the earth your faith overcomes
[1:01:19] the things of the world what is your
[1:01:21] faith your faith is that act that God
[1:01:24] has did in you to make you a son of God
[1:01:26] you quit your line you quit your
[1:01:28] stealing you quit your drinkin because
[1:01:31] faith rises you up above it hey man if
[1:01:34] you don't do it you don't have any faith
[1:01:36] and
[1:01:37] Faithie are you Sade and that's our
[1:01:39] grace and as much as your faith will be
[1:01:42] released that's not how much power you
[1:01:45] have because in you dwells the power to
[1:01:48] make heavens and earth God dwells in you
[1:01:50] and your sons and daughters of God in
[1:01:51] man there you are but it's your faith
[1:01:53] jesus said according your faith be it
[1:01:55] unto you if thou canst believe all
[1:01:57] things are possible verily I say to you
[1:02:00] if you say to this mountain be thou
[1:02:02] removed and don't doubt but believe what
[1:02:05] you said so now when God made man
[1:02:08] he made this little compartment in the
[1:02:12] man for his own throne now you and I who
[1:02:16] never could take a microscope and really
[1:02:18] find it right neither can you find your
[1:02:22] spirit or the breaths of your life and
[1:02:24] when it leaves you can't see it when it
[1:02:26] goes and the same thing with the soul of
[1:02:30] man is something that is not is not
[1:02:33] tangible or are able to be see or taste
[1:02:37] or feel or hear or reach by the five
[1:02:40] senses it is something that though that
[1:02:43] is real that is on the inside of you
[1:02:46] it's a consciousness and and God made
[1:02:50] this for his throne this is to be the
[1:02:53] tower the control tower through which he
[1:02:57] operates and controls your all your
[1:03:00] thinking your movements your your
[1:03:02] beliefs everything is to be done where
[1:03:05] God that leads the man busy man wants to
[1:03:09] lead itself
[1:03:10] and so there is a war that goes on
[1:03:14] constantly men wants to go after what he
[1:03:18] sees with his eyes now I'm again if I
[1:03:22] told you you got to look beyond you got
[1:03:24] to see beyond what you are seeing a man
[1:03:28] but man wants to go after what he sees
[1:03:30] with his eyes and that's where he's to
[1:03:33] see that's where Satan to see d-word by
[1:03:37] what she could see the fruit was
[1:03:39] pleasant to the eyes a man but it was
[1:03:43] death to the soul and when man followed
[1:03:46] his own way getting off on his own
[1:03:48] leading is what separates
[1:03:50] him from fellowship with God when he
[1:03:53] started looking with what he could see
[1:03:56] by his eyes now this is still a problem
[1:04:01] today we're we're seeing things through
[1:04:04] the eyes of man many times you're you're
[1:04:09] looking at situations you're looking if
[1:04:12] your problems and you're looking there
[1:04:15] with just human eyes and you're gonna
[1:04:18] have to see beyond what you're seeing
[1:04:19] now door to the heart brother rather
[1:04:23] than shared with us that he said you're
[1:04:26] given five senses and then he says then
[1:04:29] five senses your intellectuals was never
[1:04:32] given you to Legion but the sixth sense
[1:04:37] was which his faith was given to you to
[1:04:40] lead you and that sixth sense is a super
[1:04:44] sense it is to lead you and he says
[1:04:47] notice he says these senses was given to
[1:04:50] you only to contact your earthly home
[1:04:53] but that you might see taste and feel
[1:04:56] smelling here but they weren't no by no
[1:05:00] means to lead you you see folks dr. neva
[1:05:06] today has bound up the spiritual eyes of
[1:05:10] the church for generations brother
[1:05:12] Branham would use that example he said
[1:05:14] what have you bound up the eyes of a
[1:05:17] people for generation after generation
[1:05:20] after generation he said after a while
[1:05:23] they would be born blind and he said the
[1:05:26] same thing will happen with the church
[1:05:28] if you've got generation after
[1:05:31] generation after generation
[1:05:33] you know bind up the eyes of the church
[1:05:36] where they are not seeing with spiritual
[1:05:39] eyes are you with me then you're gonna
[1:05:42] have children that are born in the
[1:05:44] church who that are blind and they
[1:05:47] cannot see what God is doing and man and
[1:05:51] brother madam said that's what the
[1:05:52] church has done to the sixth sense that
[1:05:55] God put in him he plays he has just
[1:05:58] placed faith off in miracles and signs
[1:06:02] and then the things that that contacts
[1:06:04] God gives him the Holy Ghost and things
[1:06:07] at his place are back there and back off
[1:06:09] somewhere else
[1:06:10] until it's the thing has become dead
[1:06:12] that's right he don't know how to use it
[1:06:15] there's just nothing to him you said
[1:06:19] well God is a healer for what about that
[1:06:21] God is a healer if he ever was a healer
[1:06:23] he's still a healer if he ever was a
[1:06:26] Savior he's still a savior if he ever
[1:06:29] was God he's still God but you see
[1:06:33] you've said a lack of faith that has
[1:06:35] been preached into the people a man that
[1:06:40] makes them left that sixth sense which
[1:06:43] is faith than a doormat
[1:06:46] I don't want to be guilty of that as a
[1:06:48] preacher hey man I don't want to be
[1:06:51] guilty of binding up the eyes of the
[1:06:53] church remember that they only have the
[1:06:56] memories of God in the past and they
[1:06:59] cannot see what spiritual eyes Christ
[1:07:01] among us a Living God how many are you
[1:07:05] this morning say I want to see a living
[1:07:07] God that's who I want to serve is a God
[1:07:10] that lives now again you know you go
[1:07:14] back to the days of Abraham and Abraham
[1:07:17] when hope was gone he believed he
[1:07:23] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:07:25] through unbelief but was strong in the
[1:07:27] faith giving glory to God and to do this
[1:07:30] he could not look at since knowledge now
[1:07:35] we will be talking about that this
[1:07:36] morning since knowledge and I want you
[1:07:39] to understand it's a terminology that
[1:07:41] brother Branham used several times
[1:07:43] throughout as a message but it's called
[1:07:45] since knowledge we know by our senses
[1:07:49] we're going by what we see what we hear
[1:07:53] what we feel now brother Branham said
[1:07:59] God called Abraham and separated him and
[1:08:01] the only thing he had to do or the only
[1:08:05] thing you had to believe was God's Word
[1:08:07] faith comes by hearing and all reason
[1:08:10] and since knowledge had to pass away and
[1:08:13] he had the
[1:08:14] and exactly Oh what the sent the Lord
[1:08:18] look Abraham was 75 his wife Sarah was
[1:08:22] 65 and he was going to give him a child
[1:08:24] by Sarah and Abraham couldn't say now
[1:08:27] let me see now if there's such a way let
[1:08:31] me go down and ask the doctor if Sarah
[1:08:33] could renew her strength what he
[1:08:35] couldn't reason it out but he based his
[1:08:38] faith Oh thus saith the Lord is that
[1:08:42] right I mean that's the way it's always
[1:08:44] been down through the ages
[1:08:46] Noah couldn't see the rain coming but he
[1:08:49] had a word from God and he looked beyond
[1:08:53] what he can see and he can see judgment
[1:08:56] coming come on a man and we you we today
[1:09:00] you can look beyond what you see and you
[1:09:03] know that fire is about to power we're
[1:09:07] living in an evil day are you with me
[1:09:10] now but we're basing our faith I'll dust
[1:09:14] saith the Lord
[1:09:16] now again brother Branham said this in
[1:09:19] expectation where he uses this
[1:09:21] terminology again
[1:09:22] he said all Christians most all
[1:09:25] Christianity and the way we see it today
[1:09:27] is so shallow it's like bubble dancing
[1:09:32] you speak of the spirit and know little
[1:09:35] of it that's right you don't get down
[1:09:38] and deal with the actual facts of it you
[1:09:41] see that's the reason that the illusions
[1:09:44] today just know from a word standpoint
[1:09:48] they approach it like that with a sense
[1:09:51] knowledge and know nothing about the
[1:09:54] indwelling Spirit and the power they
[1:09:57] don't deal with spirit they just look at
[1:10:00] and say well I believe it's this and you
[1:10:01] draw your own conception and that's the
[1:10:04] reason they make fatal mistakes I don't
[1:10:07] want to be a shallow Christian again he
[1:10:12] would talk about this using this term
[1:10:14] and he said now if you look at live when
[1:10:17] you hear the gospel preached on the
[1:10:20] basis of the word that settles it your
[1:10:23] heel right there but you cannot be
[1:10:24] healed by Middle's
[1:10:27] you got to be healed by real living
[1:10:31] faith from your heart no matter how much
[1:10:34] you've worked up here and no matter how
[1:10:36] much you just believe up here if
[1:10:39] something down in here tells you it's
[1:10:41] over it's over that settles it there's
[1:10:46] no more fear nobody can tell you any
[1:10:49] different you don't know why you believe
[1:10:51] it it's not reason it's faith you just
[1:10:57] believe it and that's the way it takes
[1:10:59] place you believe it and go on no matter
[1:11:01] what your sense knowledge would say and
[1:11:04] it'd be out I'll be all out of reason it
[1:11:08] was out of reason for Abraham and Sarah
[1:11:10] to have a baby but they believed it
[1:11:12] anyhow and it's all out of reason for a
[1:11:16] man to stay alive in the belly of a well
[1:11:18] but he did anyhow
[1:11:20] amen it's all out of reason for a man to
[1:11:23] raise one from the dead but he did it
[1:11:25] anyhow a man yes it's true it's not
[1:11:28] reason it's faith right hey man that's
[1:11:34] why we need revelation I'm coming back
[1:11:38] to that remember we entered we ended on
[1:11:40] the need for revelation and how we
[1:11:43] should pray for revelation more than
[1:11:45] anything you'll read that quote again
[1:11:47] and in a moment but listen we need
[1:11:50] revelation we want certain things to
[1:11:54] happen but what is God's mind about it
[1:11:57] what does God will done you see Adam was
[1:12:03] in the image of God and my faith Adam
[1:12:07] had dominion over the world by faith he
[1:12:11] just the garden but faith he controlled
[1:12:14] the animals upon the earth when the fall
[1:12:17] came his faith dwarfed and his senses
[1:12:21] began to lead him now he was no longer
[1:12:24] operating by faith he would be operating
[1:12:27] by the sweat of his brow what he can see
[1:12:29] taste fell feeling here with his own
[1:12:32] strength to move a tree it would now
[1:12:35] take an axe
[1:12:36] and lots of sweat hey ma'am I meant to
[1:12:40] control the animal would mean to kill
[1:12:42] the Beast to subdue him in some way in
[1:12:46] some different ways by using the
[1:12:48] intellects of man no longer could he
[1:12:51] control their earth by faith because sin
[1:12:55] came in the picture a man now what God
[1:12:59] is want to do is resurrect us back to
[1:13:02] faith again and my word we are
[1:13:05] controlling things in an atmosphere of
[1:13:08] faith bringing come now Jesus did it
[1:13:13] with a word he cast out devils made the
[1:13:16] sickness leave with the word and my
[1:13:20] faith in the word made devils tremble is
[1:13:24] that right
[1:13:24] amen phase in the word go that allows us
[1:13:27] for dead days dead from the grave faith
[1:13:30] made him to walk on the waters faith
[1:13:34] calls him to speak to a trajan sea and
[1:13:37] the whole sea became quiet that right he
[1:13:41] did it by word the second Adam now this
[1:13:47] is the reason we're pointing to Jesus is
[1:13:50] because he's the first of the new race
[1:13:52] and man and every son of God's can be
[1:13:55] born in His image every newborn child
[1:13:59] and man would be born in His image
[1:14:02] because time baguettes kind species we
[1:14:05] get species so if Jesus gives birth to
[1:14:09] sons he's gonna have sons just like him
[1:14:11] is that right
[1:14:12] amen now again again brother Branham
[1:14:16] said that God gave you the five census
[1:14:18] as a gift and it depends on what you
[1:14:22] yield these senses to will be the way
[1:14:24] your life is controlled the way you
[1:14:26] yield those five senses what you see
[1:14:28] what you hear what you taste smile feel
[1:14:30] whatever those sensors are yielded to
[1:14:33] they will dominate you now already you
[1:14:37] know many of you have been listening to
[1:14:38] the news and it's been dominating
[1:14:42] a man has been dominating your thinking
[1:14:45] even dominating your attitudes some of
[1:14:49] you dominated your passions such as
[1:14:52] anger come on because you are looking at
[1:14:59] what you see instead of looking in the
[1:15:03] eyes of the word of God
[1:15:05] and what God's mind is about it
[1:15:09] hey man come on now hey man we're we're
[1:15:13] grateful that God gave us the five
[1:15:14] senses but they were not giving you to
[1:15:17] lead you and man they were giving you
[1:15:20] just for earthly contact Amen there was
[1:15:23] a sixth sense that Long's only to the
[1:15:26] Christian how many are Christian then
[1:15:29] you got a sixth sense
[1:15:31] and man then and that's the only way
[1:15:33] that you can have more than six inches
[1:15:36] five senses for the natural person is to
[1:15:39] be a Christian and that that is faith is
[1:15:42] the one that is to govern and to guide
[1:15:45] you and it's superior to what you're
[1:15:49] seeing taste and smell and feeling or
[1:15:51] hearing now don't mean the other senses
[1:15:55] are no good but they were not given to
[1:15:58] you to lead you amen the five senses are
[1:16:03] contrary to the Word of God their life
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:10] but the sixth sense cannot lie a man
[1:16:14] it's a super since then we're gonna get
[1:16:18] into it if I get the time today this
[1:16:20] variety is a super race she has a super
[1:16:24] sense she is a mind of Christ hey man
[1:16:29] the super sense is the Holy Spirit and
[1:16:33] when the faith of God that dwells in you
[1:16:36] so if you have the Holy Spirit you have
[1:16:38] faith within you hey man now and that
[1:16:42] that is so if you can let the five
[1:16:45] senses now be yielded to the sixth sense
[1:16:47] it will guide you and bring all the
[1:16:50] other five senses under control of their
[1:16:52] super sense
[1:16:54] it's so far beyond and above the natural
[1:16:58] sense as the spirits of man is above the
[1:17:01] natural as far as the heaven is above
[1:17:04] the natural man and his five senses it
[1:17:07] makes you believe things that you cannot
[1:17:10] see now it makes you act where you do
[1:17:17] not think that five senses would ever
[1:17:20] think about it the devil can get in
[1:17:23] these five senses and lie to you but he
[1:17:26] can't touch the super sense that is far
[1:17:30] beyond its reach that come from God it's
[1:17:32] called faith and faith is that great
[1:17:36] thing now and the five senses do not
[1:17:39] control the sixth sense but the six is
[1:17:41] controls the five senses and madness
[1:17:45] super-sis controls the natural senses
[1:17:48] and the five senses are seat eight smell
[1:17:50] feeling here and the super sense is
[1:17:52] something that'll make you believe God's
[1:17:54] Word but that's the only thing it will
[1:17:57] speak about a man so the super sense
[1:18:01] only looks at God's Word what does God
[1:18:04] say about this hey ma'am now and it'll
[1:18:09] make you believe things for me four
[1:18:12] things that you can't see that are
[1:18:15] totally unreasonable a man that that are
[1:18:19] contrary to your feeling somebody with
[1:18:22] me I mean even contrary to what you're
[1:18:25] hearing from the doctor the world or
[1:18:27] wherever you're getting your information
[1:18:29] from amen and it'll deliver that word to
[1:18:32] you and make you walk contrary to any
[1:18:35] other thing there is but God's Word
[1:18:38] that's what faith will do now so again
[1:18:43] we but when when we when we're born the
[1:18:48] only thing we know about is just in our
[1:18:50] intellectual thinking we think is a man
[1:18:52] we see as a man we understand the man we
[1:18:55] hear as a man but when we become born
[1:18:57] again we are gloving or regenerated and
[1:19:02] born again and when that happens the
[1:19:04] sixth sense
[1:19:05] takes ahold of us
[1:19:07] and doing so that super sense raises you
[1:19:10] up to a spot word that you cannot bake
[1:19:13] to believe things that you could not
[1:19:15] hear things you could not see
[1:19:18] understandings you could not understand
[1:19:21] and you believe it in how because you're
[1:19:23] governed by the sixth sense the super
[1:19:27] sense hallelujah
[1:19:30] hey ma'am so that five senses were you
[1:19:33] know that that super sense is to make
[1:19:36] your five senses deny everything
[1:19:41] that's a contrary to God's Word so you
[1:19:45] look at something and you say well I see
[1:19:47] this but the super sense will make you
[1:19:49] deny what you're seeing I heard the
[1:19:53] doctors say this but the super sense
[1:19:55] will make you deny what the doctor said
[1:20:00] and now man your feelings say you can't
[1:20:04] overcome that cigarette habit or that
[1:20:06] doper that stuff that you've been on and
[1:20:09] yet but the super sense says I can
[1:20:11] overcome it
[1:20:12] I can rise up above this high mountain
[1:20:17] now so the super sense doesn't see all
[1:20:22] of that at all it means when David what
[1:20:25] David looked at the Goliath he looked at
[1:20:27] it with the super sense and he says you
[1:20:31] you know who are you to defy your
[1:20:33] uncircumcised you're out of the covenant
[1:20:36] got it on your side and who are you to
[1:20:40] defy the armies of the Living God a man
[1:20:44] and he saw him as nothing and he saw his
[1:20:48] God has everything
[1:20:51] hey man now so you walk by the city to
[1:20:55] suit the the sixth sense you talk by
[1:20:58] that Cygnus six things what was David
[1:21:00] doing today I cut your head off what was
[1:21:04] he doing he didn't have a sword but he
[1:21:08] was talking by the super sense a man he
[1:21:12] was proclaiming things he could not see
[1:21:15] to be already so hey ma'am
[1:21:21] so you you walk by that sixth sense you
[1:21:24] talk by that sixth sense you even died
[1:21:26] by that sixth sense these all died in
[1:21:28] faith a man you rise by that super sense
[1:21:32] a man because it's something in you that
[1:21:36] is different than what's in the natural
[1:21:38] man now you know you know I have an
[1:21:42] organ here that brother Jerry Roncalli
[1:21:45] is having trouble with today his eyes
[1:21:48] God
[1:21:50] I'm asking you to touch that right now
[1:21:52] in Jesus name how many agree with me we
[1:21:56] can believe hey man I've got a I got an
[1:22:00] organ called an eye to which I can see
[1:22:02] I've got an organ called in here through
[1:22:06] which I can hear hey man I have an organ
[1:22:11] here some of you thinks it's a big one a
[1:22:15] mountain about which I can smell but
[1:22:20] faith is the organ which enables people
[1:22:24] to see the invisible order now and when
[1:22:33] you're born again God puts dis give you
[1:22:36] so that you can believe things that the
[1:22:40] natural mind could never believe and see
[1:22:43] things that the natural mind could never
[1:22:47] our natural I could never see I mean
[1:22:49] look a look with Moses when he stood
[1:22:51] there and he looks at his choices a poor
[1:22:54] people or favor of strong a man and he
[1:23:01] looked beyond what he could see because
[1:23:07] he saw the richest nation and the grave
[1:23:09] me and the greatest general and the
[1:23:12] greatest army and he saw them defeated
[1:23:15] and this little bitty nation of slaves
[1:23:19] being liberated and going to a new land
[1:23:23] [Music]
[1:23:25] he looked with a different eye then what
[1:23:30] he could see that's what I'm that's what
[1:23:33] I'm trying to tell sometimes you young
[1:23:35] people you gotta look at things with a
[1:23:37] different eye than what you're seeing
[1:23:40] you see what popularity as you see what
[1:23:44] makes you socially acceptable you see
[1:23:46] what the world wants you to be like you
[1:23:50] gotta look beyond that and see the
[1:23:52] spirit behind it
[1:23:55] hey man see the spirit behind it I'm in
[1:24:00] here a lot of times you you don't look
[1:24:02] at that but you know a bit but the
[1:24:04] spirit behind is the spirit of rebellion
[1:24:06] a man a spirit that will will make you
[1:24:11] not to be unsub ejected subjected to the
[1:24:14] word hour or as a woman to her husband
[1:24:17] or whatever it is it'll be the house
[1:24:19] spirit there you gotta look beyond what
[1:24:22] you're just seeing now so this is this
[1:24:32] is why that things happen let me just
[1:24:34] read some of this that natural man only
[1:24:37] has these five senses they're all right
[1:24:39] as long as it can be brought in
[1:24:41] submission to the sixth sense if the
[1:24:45] natural mind reads or to God and said
[1:24:47] that sort of God is speaking the truth
[1:24:49] but if it reads it and it says it's not
[1:24:53] all the Word of God or it was one time
[1:24:55] but it isn't now then that six cents
[1:24:59] come in and say but he's the same
[1:25:00] yesterday today and forever that's the
[1:25:04] difference that's why so many people
[1:25:07] fail to be healed they are trying to
[1:25:10] come with an intellectual conception and
[1:25:13] they say oh I do this and I believe this
[1:25:16] and so forth but if that sixth sense is
[1:25:19] saying that then there is nothing that
[1:25:21] will shake them from that sixth sense
[1:25:24] sixth sense denies all symptoms
[1:25:29] a man anything that contrary the word of
[1:25:32] God's word any feeling any emotion Amen
[1:25:38] somebody said well I prayed for but I
[1:25:40] just don't feel any better and then the
[1:25:45] sixth sense will never stand for that
[1:25:47] the success will say that's a lie
[1:25:51] Amen because my feelings are not saying
[1:25:54] what God's Word said and today I'm
[1:25:58] agreeing with what God's Word said no
[1:26:02] matter what my feelings are saying
[1:26:04] they're not yet in accordance with what
[1:26:07] God's Word said success won't stand for
[1:26:16] that it'll say it's a line I'm getting
[1:26:20] well God said so that settles it God
[1:26:24] said so the success only feeds on the
[1:26:26] Word of God that's super sense it's
[1:26:30] super it's about all the other senses
[1:26:32] it's greater sense it's of faith it's a
[1:26:35] power that stirs and drives it's
[1:26:37] something that makes you do things you
[1:26:39] never thought you would do if the sixth
[1:26:41] sense of super sense you get prayed for
[1:26:43] say you got a crippled hand and you get
[1:26:46] prayed for in your hand you come up
[1:26:47] there and you believe God's gonna hear
[1:26:49] you in the prayer the pastor prays for
[1:26:51] you you go back the old natural man will
[1:26:53] say this you don't feel any better or
[1:26:55] any different in that hand you're no
[1:26:58] better than what you ever was but if the
[1:27:02] sixth sense comes along and said that's
[1:27:04] a lie you've been prayed for that
[1:27:06] settles it hey man you know you're going
[1:27:10] to be healed it may not happen today it
[1:27:15] may not happen tomorrow come on
[1:27:17] something yeah we we want miracles The
[1:27:20] Healing is not a miracle even John
[1:27:23] Rhines healing was not a miracle he was
[1:27:27] blind amen it was blind and brother
[1:27:31] Branham tells him in the prayer line you
[1:27:33] know you're healed he goes back off
[1:27:37] walks off the platform as blind as ever
[1:27:40] and then he says
[1:27:42] you know he gets to talking with
[1:27:44] somebody in the back and said that man
[1:27:46] said I was healed I don't understand I
[1:27:48] can't see and he gets him back in the
[1:27:50] line again and he says he said what are
[1:27:55] you doing back in the line you're healed
[1:27:57] he said well I can't see he said that
[1:27:59] doesn't have nothing to do with it
[1:28:00] he said you said you believe me he said
[1:28:03] well I do you told me things I don't
[1:28:05] know that nobody else knew you told in
[1:28:07] secrets of my heart yes I have to
[1:28:09] believe you what must I do didn't you go
[1:28:11] off testifying thank God for healing me
[1:28:17] Amen because what you see he had to hold
[1:28:20] on to that promise
[1:28:22] even though thus saith the Lord had come
[1:28:28] same way with you you get a word from
[1:28:31] God you don't give up on it you keep
[1:28:34] holding on to that promise hey man if
[1:28:38] God gave you a promise
[1:28:39] hold on to it hey man take out take a
[1:28:43] grip of it now God wants to leave me so
[1:28:49] he puts him a control tower in the midst
[1:28:52] of his heart so a man can be led by the
[1:28:54] Spirit of God but the scripture said
[1:28:57] sons of God and daughters of God are led
[1:29:00] by the Spirit of God and a man it didn't
[1:29:03] say you are led by your five senses what
[1:29:06] you can see taste smell feeling hear
[1:29:08] sake you're led by the Spirit yes for
[1:29:12] some your emotions is your control tower
[1:29:17] and you can notice a man or a woman they
[1:29:21] transferred walk after the things of the
[1:29:23] world they can never please God you know
[1:29:26] why they're going by their motions oh
[1:29:29] isn't that cute oh isn't that wouldn't I
[1:29:33] look like a doll like that oh you know
[1:29:36] just to fit in you're going you're ruled
[1:29:39] by your emotions
[1:29:41] mmm but a man or a woman that will not
[1:29:44] look at the things the world but just go
[1:29:47] according to the leading of the Spirit
[1:29:49] and let me just tell you this fear will
[1:29:52] only direct you to the word
[1:29:54] a man you know dead then there's were
[1:29:58] the great fighters today Satan took the
[1:30:02] eye a man's head that control him by his
[1:30:04] head and got to his heart
[1:30:07] so just remember even as a believer
[1:30:11] you're saved and you got faith in your
[1:30:13] heart but Satan will try to anoint your
[1:30:17] senses to believe things that is
[1:30:22] contrary to the Word of God this is why
[1:30:28] you know it doesn't cancel out your
[1:30:30] salvation it just simply keeps you from
[1:30:33] having your healing and your deliverance
[1:30:39] let me say God helped me to keep my eyes
[1:30:42] on you brother Branham said even then he
[1:30:46] said that's he said a man's always
[1:30:48] trying to achieve something by his head
[1:30:50] he's supposed to achieve but thighs
[1:30:52] heart and that's the control tower where
[1:30:55] God controls him and directs his
[1:30:57] thoughts and drex's walk directs his
[1:30:59] emotion what's now he said sometimes I
[1:31:03] get happy I get so happy I just have to
[1:31:06] let it loose and if I look around and
[1:31:11] see somebody and then I get my eyes on
[1:31:14] people then that means ever done that it
[1:31:20] mean you feel the Holy Spirit and go to
[1:31:22] moving man you just feel such joy in
[1:31:25] your heart you just want to let it loose
[1:31:26] but you're afraid of what everybody else
[1:31:27] thinks
[1:31:30] amen amen he says I got my eyes on
[1:31:34] people then he said God came to help me
[1:31:38] to keep my eyes closed I want to be led
[1:31:40] by the Spirit of God not that the flesh
[1:31:44] will have nothing to do into it so
[1:31:48] that's what we do we quench the spirit a
[1:31:52] man to please the flesh
[1:31:56] usually set ministers get in the pulpit
[1:31:59] they begin to think if I speak on a
[1:32:00] certain certain thing here's a certain
[1:32:03] member of my church that is a good payer
[1:32:05] in this church they'll leave the church
[1:32:07] and then you I'll go to looking at the
[1:32:10] bless again then God can't lead that
[1:32:12] spirit you've got to say what the Spirit
[1:32:16] says to say then we are led by the
[1:32:19] Spirit of God
[1:32:22] how many wants the Spirit led minister a
[1:32:26] mad now your self subconscious is your
[1:32:31] soul and you usually move by your
[1:32:35] subconscious and and that's the reason
[1:32:39] with preachers today they don't believe
[1:32:41] in divine healing and they won't preach
[1:32:44] it because salvation has never come down
[1:32:48] in the heart it's only in their head
[1:32:54] hello the sub-conscience is a control
[1:32:58] center the control center is what you
[1:33:02] are it moves you you live by in this
[1:33:04] either of God or Satan if you're born
[1:33:09] again if you're born again the Holy
[1:33:11] Spirit abides there within the soul
[1:33:14] controlling your life revealing his will
[1:33:16] to you and remember the Bible's always
[1:33:18] his will if not Satan abides there and
[1:33:22] you have nothing to believe with now so
[1:33:26] you have as it word to consciousness
[1:33:28] you've got a mind the intellect where
[1:33:31] your memory your imagination your reason
[1:33:33] your affection your conscience your
[1:33:35] sense of right and wrong and so one is
[1:33:37] there and people try to look at their
[1:33:41] intellect for faith when faith doesn't
[1:33:44] lay their reasons lay there but they've
[1:33:46] lays in the soul and that's why Jesus
[1:33:50] said if you say to this mountain and be
[1:33:53] thou removed and be thou counseling to
[1:33:55] see and don't doubt in your heart
[1:33:59] remember believe that those things which
[1:34:02] he says have come to pass he will have
[1:34:04] whatsoever he said it has to be
[1:34:05] something you believe
[1:34:07] from the heart in other words it's a
[1:34:09] revelation of faith now again romans 10
[1:34:15] and 9 we went through the scripture last
[1:34:17] week but just want to touch it briefly
[1:34:19] that if thou shalt confess with thy
[1:34:22] mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe
[1:34:24] in thine heart notice here where you
[1:34:27] have to believe in the heart that God
[1:34:31] has raised him from the dead thou shalt
[1:34:34] be saved but with the heart man
[1:34:37] believeth unto righteousness and with
[1:34:40] the mouth confession is made unto
[1:34:42] salvation deliverance so you see many
[1:34:47] people believe this in their mind but
[1:34:50] the word don't perform for them and it's
[1:34:52] because they don't believe it from the
[1:34:55] heart it's got to be something revealed
[1:35:00] to you now the sub-conscience is where
[1:35:04] you live let me just go through some of
[1:35:07] these statements real quick the
[1:35:09] sub-conscience is where you live that's
[1:35:12] a reason for people it's hard for them
[1:35:13] to have faith up here they say yes I got
[1:35:16] faith but something down here says but
[1:35:19] it's not for you this fellow up here
[1:35:24] says I believe God heals and I believe
[1:35:28] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:35:29] forever
[1:35:30] but the subconscious says but it's not
[1:35:33] for you the conscience of the mind says
[1:35:37] and I'm quoting brother Branham oh
[1:35:39] brother Branham I got all faiths and he
[1:35:42] said they believe that in sincerity but
[1:35:44] down on the inside in the subconscious
[1:35:46] place lays a place called the soul and
[1:35:49] this in Alexa mind does not govern the
[1:35:51] vibration of the system the mind is only
[1:35:53] a director it will direct you and it's
[1:35:56] very incapable of bringing you to God
[1:35:58] your mind and you cannot know God by
[1:36:01] your mind the intellectual it's one of
[1:36:04] the resources or channels that will lead
[1:36:06] you to it but your soul is what governs
[1:36:09] you you are what you are by yourself
[1:36:15] again
[1:36:17] you know and I wonder you share this
[1:36:20] dealing with the subconscious and then
[1:36:21] we'll go on
[1:36:22] but brother branham had several things
[1:36:24] to say and bear with me as I just share
[1:36:27] it with you but I think it's important
[1:36:29] that we just lay these things out as we
[1:36:31] get into this he says now there's a
[1:36:35] reason that people doesn't get the
[1:36:38] healing and the blessings that sometimes
[1:36:40] they so reverently asked for you woke up
[1:36:45] in perhaps 90% 99% of out of every 100
[1:36:50] in here tonight do you believe Jesus
[1:36:52] Christ can heal you yes and without a
[1:36:56] shadow of a doubt they believe that
[1:37:00] well then Jesus said if you believe it
[1:37:03] you shall receive it but that's just a
[1:37:07] conscience believe in it now you've got
[1:37:09] a subconscious
[1:37:10] that's gotta act - so you're believing
[1:37:14] it from up here hey ma'am oh yeah I
[1:37:18] believe that yeah I believe that story
[1:37:20] yeah I believe it Jonah really got some
[1:37:23] a little swollen by well I really
[1:37:24] believe of the Red Sea opened up and it
[1:37:27] was a deep sea and then and there was a
[1:37:30] pop me yeah I really believe Jesus rose
[1:37:32] from the dead but you're doing it here
[1:37:36] it's never here because down in here
[1:37:40] something's governed you out here
[1:37:42] directing you contrary to the word and
[1:37:44] you know that cannot be right he said
[1:37:49] it's like a man crossing the sea
[1:37:52] when you go into the ship the man runs
[1:37:55] to this the ship the man who runs his
[1:37:58] ship or guides it sets up here in the
[1:38:00] pilothouse
[1:38:01] the man that really runs his hip goes
[1:38:03] down the bowels of the ship down into
[1:38:05] the hole of it he's the engineer no
[1:38:08] matter how much this guy here says this
[1:38:11] guy that does the work that's your
[1:38:12] subconscious this is your your first
[1:38:15] conscience now if this fellow here
[1:38:16] receives an order from the mate or
[1:38:18] whoever it is what he's about to do he
[1:38:20] passes on down he guides his ship but
[1:38:22] this man has to do with the the running
[1:38:24] of it no matter how much he does the
[1:38:26] guiding it won't do a bit of good until
[1:38:29] you got some steam down
[1:38:30] here are some pressure pulling it now
[1:38:33] for what if he sets an order down two
[1:38:36] knots to the left and this man turns two
[1:38:39] knots to the right won't do no good
[1:38:42] which way he turns it here you see
[1:38:44] you're going around and around in the
[1:38:46] harbor you'll never get out well that's
[1:38:49] the conscience and the subconscious this
[1:38:51] fellow here he believes all right but
[1:38:54] this won't cooperate with him a man now
[1:38:58] the reason it would don't cooperate when
[1:39:00] you get here to get prayed for each
[1:39:01] night I'd say to lay your hands on each
[1:39:04] other believe with all your heart and
[1:39:05] you shall receive what you ask for God
[1:39:07] comes around and confirms exists exactly
[1:39:09] what is said the truth of his presence
[1:39:12] being here and there's not a mortal
[1:39:14] mentally right but with no but what
[1:39:16] that's the truth and yes you say I
[1:39:18] believe it and the next night you're
[1:39:20] right back in the prayer line again see
[1:39:22] it shows that there's a little fear down
[1:39:26] here yes I believe it but is it really
[1:39:28] for me and that's the subconscious
[1:39:32] saying that
[1:39:33] now if the subconscious and this
[1:39:37] conscience will agree perfectly together
[1:39:39] then when an order comes I am the Lord
[1:39:42] that healeth thee right here and that I
[1:39:46] am the lord that healeth thee and the
[1:39:47] sub-conscience says he's the Lord that
[1:39:49] healeth me to chipper go out to sea
[1:39:52] there you are is got to be an agreement
[1:39:54] God first conscience second conscience
[1:39:57] and then and then our subconscious and
[1:40:00] then there's not a shadow of a doubt no
[1:40:03] matter if it's the next day you as twice
[1:40:06] as sick as you was when you come to
[1:40:09] church that night you're healed anyhow
[1:40:11] you're just healed any out there's
[1:40:13] nothing can take you out of it it's
[1:40:15] going to be done because you've accepted
[1:40:17] it there's something anchored in there
[1:40:19] there's far beyond sight any physical
[1:40:22] and mental thing that you can have any
[1:40:23] of the senses would never declare it
[1:40:26] like faith and a lot of people are going
[1:40:31] on since knowledge of how what they
[1:40:35] still see or what they still feel
[1:40:37] instead of what the Word of God said
[1:40:40] a man now but when they come in perfect
[1:40:46] agreement that's when you're gonna move
[1:40:48] towards your healing your deliverance
[1:40:50] are you with me now again you you see
[1:40:54] you can believe it up here he says let
[1:40:57] me just say it they believe it up here
[1:40:59] but don't down here and this this here
[1:41:02] will overrule because the sub-conscience
[1:41:04] will move on you'll try to walk out with
[1:41:07] a middle conception glory to God him
[1:41:09] he'll praise the Lord I'm here and write
[1:41:11] down saying it isn't so it's not a
[1:41:14] revelation here and he said and finally
[1:41:17] this rules this full rule stopped right
[1:41:20] away and with these symptoms and why
[1:41:22] rights than you just say well I just
[1:41:24] didn't get it and that's without the
[1:41:29] conscience of the mind has to be an
[1:41:31] agreement with the conscience of the
[1:41:34] soul and they must both be in agreement
[1:41:39] with the world hey man and that's when
[1:41:43] healing will take place when you can get
[1:41:46] the mind and the heart together agreeing
[1:41:49] with the word then you'll be healed all
[1:41:53] right
[1:41:54] now that's why you need to pray for to
[1:41:57] God for revelation more than anything
[1:42:01] you got a need in your life start
[1:42:04] praying to God for revelation so lord I
[1:42:07] need a revelation on this I need it
[1:42:09] quick into my heart many of you know if
[1:42:12] you're you're unsaved it got to give you
[1:42:14] a revelation of salvation you sure will
[1:42:18] amen
[1:42:19] but again it's got to be from the heart
[1:42:21] a man is what he is was he believes from
[1:42:25] the heart therefore if a man or a woman
[1:42:27] could ever get their thoughts and their
[1:42:29] testimony and their lives lined up with
[1:42:31] God until the channel of the Holy Spirit
[1:42:33] would be perfectly one with God what
[1:42:35] would take place if the man and the
[1:42:39] woman could ever get lined up where the
[1:42:41] freedom from their hearts with faith
[1:42:42] from their innermost most people come
[1:42:45] the altar to be prayed for
[1:42:46] they have been Alexa faith they confess
[1:42:49] their sins and join the church by
[1:42:51] intellectual faith they believe it in
[1:42:53] their mind
[1:42:54] they believe it cuz they've heard it
[1:42:55] they believe it cuz they know it's the
[1:42:57] best policy but it's not what God looks
[1:43:00] at he don't look at your intellectual
[1:43:02] faith he looks on the heart we're on the
[1:43:06] inside when it comes in the heart all
[1:43:07] things are possible then your confession
[1:43:10] meets up with your life and your life
[1:43:13] speaks as loud as your confession does
[1:43:16] and then when your confession says one
[1:43:19] thing and your life says another there's
[1:43:21] something wrong somewhere that's because
[1:43:24] you have an intellectual faith and not a
[1:43:26] faith from your heart and that shows
[1:43:28] that out here is a knowledge of God but
[1:43:30] inside here is a demon of doubting I
[1:43:32] believe in divine healing but it's not
[1:43:34] for me and he'll try to anoint you even
[1:43:40] those who you that are born-again I just
[1:43:43] just somehow won't work for me I know
[1:43:46] God does this but it's not for me it
[1:43:49] won't happen for me it happened oh if I
[1:43:52] could get and you're going by sense
[1:43:54] knowledge instead of walking by faith
[1:43:57] now again again you say well what about
[1:44:02] for my lost loved ones how does this
[1:44:06] work how does this apply for my lost
[1:44:09] loved ones I mean he's got lost loved
[1:44:12] ones you ones he saved alright let's
[1:44:15] just look at this you know you know our
[1:44:17] days the people of God started signing
[1:44:19] crying for the abominations that are
[1:44:24] done in the city if we start signing
[1:44:28] crying for what's going on in our
[1:44:30] neighborhoods in our world even what's
[1:44:34] going on in our church in our families
[1:44:36] and you start making something a
[1:44:40] priority come on
[1:44:43] things would be different this little
[1:44:46] woman rub brother branham I don't I
[1:44:48] don't know who she was but he says he
[1:44:50] said I want to receive the Holy Ghost I
[1:44:52] want to know what to do I'm burdened for
[1:44:54] my family to be saved and he said if you
[1:44:57] want to receive the Holy Ghost let me
[1:44:59] tell you something dear sister the Bible
[1:45:01] said blessed are they that do hunger and
[1:45:03] thirst after righteousness you're so
[1:45:05] blessed to even want it
[1:45:07] now remember not that you got it but
[1:45:10] you're blessed are they that hunger and
[1:45:13] thirst for it for they shall be filled
[1:45:14] just stay right with it what must I do
[1:45:20] for my family use the same faith that
[1:45:22] you're using for yourself for your
[1:45:25] family commit them to the Lord and
[1:45:28] believe with all your heart that you're
[1:45:30] going to be saved and don't just let it
[1:45:33] come on your natural thinking here but
[1:45:35] let it drop way down on the inside that
[1:45:38] subconscious did they're yours
[1:45:40] gods give them to you when you got it
[1:45:43] down here I meant so there's one thing
[1:45:48] that you need to be praying about you
[1:45:50] need to be praying about Revelation and
[1:45:52] say God let it drop from up here down to
[1:45:55] here
[1:45:56] so that I can believe for my children
[1:45:59] for my loved one but my needs my husband
[1:46:02] my situation let it drop from up here to
[1:46:06] down here
[1:46:07] amen whatever you have in your heart
[1:46:10] here ask for it and when you pray you
[1:46:12] believe that you receive what you ask
[1:46:14] for you don't doubt it no more you can't
[1:46:16] believe it and doubt it at the same time
[1:46:20] hey man how many knows that you can't
[1:46:23] believe and doubt at the same time
[1:46:24] you've got to believe that what you ask
[1:46:26] for you receive it then he said it would
[1:46:28] be given to you so you believe for your
[1:46:30] family and they'll get it hey man wasn't
[1:46:35] you why don't you right now start just
[1:46:37] calling itself not what you see just uh
[1:46:42] calling itself
[1:46:43] I mean God you gave me that child God
[1:46:46] you gave me that son you gave me that
[1:46:48] daughter you gave me a husband you gave
[1:46:50] me a wife you gave me this and I'm
[1:46:53] calling it so a man I'm invoking that
[1:47:00] promise
[1:47:02] hey man I'm gonna start preparing for
[1:47:04] that promise to be manifested are you
[1:47:08] with me
[1:47:08] what about divine healing brother
[1:47:10] branham said here he said I he said I
[1:47:14] want to believe believes in divine
[1:47:16] healing every one of yous you said sure
[1:47:18] brother branham I believe in divine
[1:47:20] healing now you maybe you mean that with
[1:47:22] the intelligence you know how to speak
[1:47:24] you believe it that's in your head but
[1:47:27] remember there's a subconscious down
[1:47:30] here that's got to say the same thing it
[1:47:34] David doesn't you'll never get nowhere
[1:47:37] you might read the Bible what brother
[1:47:39] branham here the bible says is and
[1:47:41] that's exactly right and that's what
[1:47:42] people today well I believe Jesus Christ
[1:47:44] the Son of God well how do you know he's
[1:47:46] the son of God the Bible said so well
[1:47:48] how do you know he's the son of God
[1:47:49] mother said so the breacher said so and
[1:47:51] they might be right but how do you know
[1:47:53] and the Bible said you cannot know until
[1:47:56] you receive the Holy Ghost you're only
[1:47:57] taking somebody else's word did you know
[1:48:01] that that doesn't do very good and but
[1:48:04] that's the truth quote it no man can say
[1:48:07] Jesus is of Christ's only by the Holy
[1:48:09] Ghost the Holy Ghost seen you has to
[1:48:11] bear record to the resurrection and
[1:48:14] Jesus being the Son of God and you're
[1:48:17] only t.r you're only taking what
[1:48:19] somebody else's words are said for it
[1:48:21] you're only taking what the Bible says
[1:48:24] the Bible's right or you're taking what
[1:48:26] the minister says the ministers right or
[1:48:28] some good person said and they're right
[1:48:31] but you as an individual don't know that
[1:48:33] Jesus is a Christ until the Holy Ghost
[1:48:35] is brought into you and notice no man
[1:48:39] can have faith for healing until it's
[1:48:43] revealed to him by the Holy Spirit
[1:48:47] that he's going to get well now you're
[1:48:56] gonna need revelation
[1:48:58] and to get revelation means that you've
[1:49:01] got to get the thinking of Christ about
[1:49:05] the matter now it's the same as a
[1:49:13] personal revelation for salvation
[1:49:16] now help me now just for bit
[1:49:20] brother brother Kaylin is probably
[1:49:23] listening in today from South Africa
[1:49:25] he's a pastor there and he and I were
[1:49:27] fellowshiping and he shared with me the
[1:49:30] definition of faith he found the
[1:49:31] wikibooks god bless you brother Kaylin
[1:49:33] in the group there with you in the Greek
[1:49:36] the word which we get faith denounce it
[1:49:41] the noun is pistis and believe the verb
[1:49:45] is P still faith means belief firm
[1:49:50] persuasion assurance firm conviction
[1:49:54] faithfulness faith is confidence in what
[1:49:59] we hope for and assurance that the Lord
[1:50:02] is working remember even when you don't
[1:50:05] see it he's working amen so even though
[1:50:10] we cannot see it
[1:50:12] faith knows that no matter what the
[1:50:15] situation in our lives or someone else's
[1:50:18] that the Lord is working in it a man it
[1:50:24] is the act whereby a person lays hold on
[1:50:28] God's resources becomes obedient to what
[1:50:31] he has prescribed and putting aside all
[1:50:34] self interests and self-reliance trust
[1:50:37] him completely it is an unqualified
[1:50:41] surrender of the whole of one's beings
[1:50:43] in dependence upon him it is holy
[1:50:47] trusting and relying upon him for all
[1:50:50] things it is not just middle ascent to
[1:50:54] the facts and realities of truth it must
[1:50:57] come from a deep inner conviction demons
[1:51:00] also believe as what James children and
[1:51:04] 19 said demons believe in shudder but
[1:51:07] they do not experience faith
[1:51:11] hey ma'am faith is a divine revelation
[1:51:17] say it again faith is a divine
[1:51:20] revelation faith comes from God it is a
[1:51:23] gift from God we're going to talk about
[1:51:27] it
[1:51:28] this word piece DS means it's called
[1:51:32] faith it's always a gift from God is
[1:51:34] never something that can reproduce my
[1:51:37] people
[1:51:39] it is phases for the believers God's
[1:51:42] divine persuasion God persuaded Gideon
[1:51:50] God persuaded Noah by God's persuasion
[1:51:56] even what with God and was not but by
[1:52:01] God's persuasion a abraham believed for
[1:52:04] a baby so faith is god's persuasion a
[1:52:11] man therefore is distinct from human
[1:52:15] belief our human confidence yet it
[1:52:19] involves that the Lord continuously
[1:52:21] bursts faith in the yielded believer
[1:52:25] continually birthing faith so they can
[1:52:29] know what the persuasion of his will is
[1:52:32] what is your will in the matter
[1:52:34] I'm brother Branham daughters you know
[1:52:37] something that was shocking to the
[1:52:38] Pentecostal world that God does not heal
[1:52:40] all now that's different than what the
[1:52:44] divine healers preached even the
[1:52:46] charismatic around preaches that God
[1:52:48] heals all
[1:52:49] God does not heal all Jesus went into a
[1:52:52] place and then he walked right in he
[1:52:55] went left his reason his sights his
[1:52:58] thinking and everything else walked
[1:53:00] right down to a man who had been laying
[1:53:01] there for 38 years and healed him and
[1:53:06] left the rest of him laying there and
[1:53:09] brother Branham told us it peace said
[1:53:12] you pretty costal people it's a lie that
[1:53:14] there's gonna be a time that we're gonna
[1:53:16] go in there and empty out the hospital
[1:53:18] it has never been done
[1:53:20] and it never will be done healing is
[1:53:23] when we can find the will of God and
[1:53:28] that's where church is gonna be where
[1:53:31] they seek the will of God and this is
[1:53:33] the fault of why we're not seeing more
[1:53:35] healer is because we're not seeking the
[1:53:38] will of God in the matter where it
[1:53:43] hadn't been looking for Revelation now
[1:53:49] God wants to continually birth faith
[1:53:51] within you anytime brother Branham said
[1:53:56] anything that God can lead your soul to
[1:54:00] believe that's yours anything that God
[1:54:07] can lead your soul to believe that's
[1:54:10] yours now that's why he said you've got
[1:54:14] all the power in you but it's controlled
[1:54:16] by law of faith and man and he said the
[1:54:20] law of faith it that opens it to you if
[1:54:22] you can just find the key and that key
[1:54:25] is Revelation God said so and when you
[1:54:30] can get now saith the Lord and thus
[1:54:32] saith the Lord can still come to his
[1:54:33] church it can still come to his church
[1:54:38] oh man I mean it doesn't take a prophet
[1:54:41] you can receive that saith the Lord that
[1:54:44] God can speak to you as an individual
[1:54:46] [Music]
[1:54:49] sons have gotten let by the Spirit of
[1:54:51] God how are you left by dust at the Lord
[1:54:54] God dealing with your spirit come up
[1:54:56] where to be spiritual people spirit let
[1:55:01] people we put ourself on autopilot
[1:55:06] although you know first to many years
[1:55:08] it's time do we got to realize we gotta
[1:55:10] buckle down really become sincere
[1:55:14] believers people doesn't pray people
[1:55:21] didn't seek the mind of God people are
[1:55:24] not Lord give me the key to that
[1:55:32] hey ma'am brother branham said as much
[1:55:41] as your faith will be released that's
[1:55:43] how much power you can have now let me
[1:55:45] stop for a minute we look over at
[1:55:47] brother Branham and we just see him my
[1:55:49] having this supreme power but I'm gonna
[1:55:56] say to you God showed us the power that
[1:55:59] laid in the word squirrels have spoken
[1:56:02] to existence three times somebody help
[1:56:07] me is that right
[1:56:09] a man he wasn't a and but the speaking
[1:56:12] of the squirrels was never brother
[1:56:15] branham's idea it wasn't him out there
[1:56:23] saying you know and entertaining people
[1:56:24] and saying okay girl you know let's have
[1:56:27] some squirrels today I need three of
[1:56:31] them let one come here one come there
[1:56:32] God told him to do that and he was
[1:56:37] showing what the mind of God could do
[1:56:40] when a man of God could yield to it let
[1:56:46] me just say it again you know when he
[1:56:48] went to Hattie Wright's house after that
[1:56:49] it was not brother branham's idea to
[1:56:54] give her what she wanted the Prophet
[1:56:59] sent a super anointing come upon me I'm
[1:57:03] super anointed and the Holy Spirit came
[1:57:09] down and what happened when she was
[1:57:11] telling all I know it could be was too
[1:57:13] oh but I referred squirrels Sapir out of
[1:57:15] nowhere and has to be Jehovah Jireh
[1:57:17] showing he's the same God still
[1:57:21] operating in men come on a man and what
[1:57:26] happened any right said there's nothing
[1:57:28] but the truth and it moved God I want
[1:57:31] you to know even in a service like this
[1:57:33] you can move God
[1:57:36] to speak on your behalf and it has to do
[1:57:41] with your attitude toward that promise
[1:57:43] oh man and faith dropped in that little
[1:57:47] woman's heart there is nothing but the
[1:57:49] truth he said give her what she asked
[1:57:55] for and she wanted the salvation of her
[1:57:58] children wasn't brother Brandon's idea
[1:58:03] when he spoke to storm
[1:58:07] he was an out there popping off shilling
[1:58:10] his power you know this way where people
[1:58:14] want to be today they want to be super
[1:58:15] super beings and a super man and speak
[1:58:18] to this storm and speak to that storm it
[1:58:20] you know God told him hey man when he
[1:58:28] spoke to the tumor in his wife's body
[1:58:30] that disappeared a thousand eleven
[1:58:33] twelve hundred miles away from
[1:58:34] Jeffersonville to Tucson his wife in
[1:58:37] Tucson him and his home in
[1:58:39] Jeffersonville kneeling down and praying
[1:58:41] and God says ask what you will what was
[1:58:48] it it was the mind of God faith is given
[1:58:53] by inspiration it is the revelation of
[1:58:58] the mind of God improving his word
[1:59:00] brother Brennan said you can only have
[1:59:02] faith as God gives you faith faith is a
[1:59:07] gift of God now it works his faith
[1:59:12] expressed I was probably there at this
[1:59:15] service don't remember it but you know I
[1:59:17] remember the wings of us know I dove but
[1:59:19] this one brother branham said now faith
[1:59:21] is a revelation from God faith is a
[1:59:24] revelation that's why I want to stay
[1:59:27] just for a woman it's a revelation he's
[1:59:29] revealed it to you by His grace it's
[1:59:31] nothing you did you didn't work yourself
[1:59:35] up into faith you ever have faith it's
[1:59:39] given to you by the grace of God and God
[1:59:41] reveals it to you therefore faith is a
[1:59:43] revelation and the whole church is built
[1:59:47] on Revelation a man now faith is always
[1:59:55] received from God it's never generated
[1:59:58] by us faith is only exclusively given to
[2:00:04] the redeem it is not a virtue that can
[2:00:09] be worked up by human effort hey man you
[2:00:13] can't deserve faith can't work for faith
[2:00:17] you can't live as a Christian long
[2:00:21] enough to be worthy of faith faith is a
[2:00:24] gift of God and my faith always comes
[2:00:30] from God and involves his revelation
[2:00:33] therefore faith is beyond belief and
[2:00:38] mine faith is God's work faith is never
[2:00:42] the work of people we cannot produce
[2:00:46] faith ourselves nor can we drum it up
[2:00:50] and we'll remember faith comes as Christ
[2:00:54] speaks the word within us that's what
[2:00:57] faith cometh by here and he said here in
[2:00:59] this hot faith it is received by hearing
[2:01:02] so we hear the word and we start
[2:01:05] believing because God gives us faith are
[2:01:10] you with me now faith brother Branham
[2:01:13] said people look to their intellect I'm
[2:01:15] there for faith when faith doesn't later
[2:01:18] the reasons later faith lays in the soul
[2:01:23] again I want you to do two quote to you
[2:01:26] from John 5 and 4 whatsoever is born of
[2:01:30] God conquers the world and this is a
[2:01:34] conquest he conquered the world our
[2:01:36] faith a man faith is a persuasion from
[2:01:41] God that we received as he grants
[2:01:44] impulse in other words a divine spark a
[2:01:50] mad you you've got the word in you
[2:01:52] that's why it's important to get the
[2:01:54] word in there but it takes that spark of
[2:01:56] faith to ignite it
[2:01:58] to make it explode and to make it work
[2:02:01] and my faith is always the work of God
[2:02:05] and involves hearing his voice a man
[2:02:10] whenever the believer lays a hold of his
[2:02:13] preferred wheel now think of this faith
[2:02:17] is always the work of God and involves
[2:02:21] hearing his voice this is why it's
[2:02:26] important that you seek the voice of God
[2:02:29] this is why it's important you seek for
[2:02:33] God's leadership what do you want done
[2:02:35] about this come on amen faith is when
[2:02:41] the word is quicken or made alive to you
[2:02:45] brother Branham said and I promise you I
[2:02:47] would read this again no man knows the
[2:02:50] things that God saved this fear of God
[2:02:52] they he to whom the Spirit of God
[2:02:54] reveals them we need to call on God for
[2:02:56] revelation more than anything else in
[2:02:59] the world faith is to be contended for
[2:03:05] come on Jude 3 said that we should
[2:03:10] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[2:03:14] once delivered to the Saints
[2:03:15] we must contend for faith I'm trying to
[2:03:21] get something to the church it's not yes
[2:03:23] it's a gift of God but is something you
[2:03:25] contend for it's something you seek the
[2:03:28] voice of God for and to do that you've
[2:03:30] got a yield to God you got a surrender
[2:03:34] to God you got all you need listen
[2:03:37] listen I know we're we're not praying
[2:03:40] enough we're not talking to God enough
[2:03:42] we're not seeking his mind enough we
[2:03:46] don't got involved in everything else of
[2:03:48] the world where our mind is on the news
[2:03:52] and what's going on out there and I want
[2:03:54] you to start seeing but what you are
[2:03:56] seeing
[2:03:58] come on amen you seeing this turmoil out
[2:04:02] here but what's God doing in all of this
[2:04:05] Amen we've seen a COBIT night team but
[2:04:08] what stop doing in all of this where is
[2:04:11] this angel where is this presence where
[2:04:15] is the Holy Ghost a man you're looking
[2:04:18] at sir cancer you're looking at your
[2:04:20] situation or your sickness or or your
[2:04:22] asthma or whatever it is you know you're
[2:04:24] looking at that you're looking our
[2:04:26] baddest but we're gonna see beyond what
[2:04:29] you are seeing we've accepted the Bible
[2:04:36] we've accepted the great truths of it
[2:04:39] but it's still not real to most people
[2:04:43] quoting your prophet because a
[2:04:46] revelation by the spirit is not there
[2:04:49] the word has not been quickened now
[2:04:54] brother Branham told us we had done we
[2:04:56] have already put too much emphasis on
[2:04:58] the mechanics and not enough on the
[2:05:01] dynamics and this whole message
[2:05:04] community is guilty of that that's right
[2:05:11] Charles price it was when the early
[2:05:14] Pentecostal fathers but he said we have
[2:05:17] made faith a condition of mind when it
[2:05:20] is divinely it is a divinely imparted
[2:05:23] grace of the heart we can only receive
[2:05:26] faith as he gives it you cannot
[2:05:28] manufacture faith and you cannot work it
[2:05:30] up brother Branham told them it told him
[2:05:34] many times the Pentecostals were
[2:05:37] especially bad about this
[2:05:38] coming into the line you know and then
[2:05:40] they would feel the presence of God the
[2:05:43] angel and they'd go to shouting and
[2:05:44] screaming and yelling and speaking in
[2:05:47] tongues and dancing around and shaking
[2:05:49] themselves and no God hallelujah amen
[2:05:52] glory to God and brother Brent said
[2:05:53] don't do that you interfere with faith
[2:05:57] there you interfere with God come up
[2:06:01] reverently and lay your hand up and
[2:06:03] believe faith you don't work yourself up
[2:06:06] to it faith is something that's already
[2:06:08] in your heart you just come and believe
[2:06:12] so it isn't something you scream down
[2:06:15] from heaven
[2:06:17] this is a lot of problems sometimes even
[2:06:20] with our youth camp you know you you
[2:06:22] know instead of yielding to the spirit
[2:06:25] instead and yes I know you yield to
[2:06:27] where you shout but let me come on your
[2:06:29] yield to him until you get something to
[2:06:32] shout about
[2:06:35] hey man sometimes you rob yourself from
[2:06:38] the blessing that you really ought to
[2:06:40] got from the real change that takes
[2:06:43] place on the heart a man Charles frights
[2:06:47] would say again you can believe a
[2:06:49] promise and at the same time not have
[2:06:51] the faith to appropriate it genuine
[2:06:55] scriptural faith is not our ability to
[2:06:57] count it done it is the deep
[2:06:59] consciousness divinely imparted to the
[2:07:01] heart of man that it is done it is the
[2:07:06] faith that only God can give do not
[2:07:08] struggle in the power of the wheel what
[2:07:11] a mistake to take our belief in God and
[2:07:13] call it faith Christ the Living Word is
[2:07:16] our sufficiency what is faith now let me
[2:07:21] just take it for a little longer the
[2:07:24] blocks busy so am i yeah so what is
[2:07:31] faith there was another Christian writer
[2:07:34] explaining faith like this faith is
[2:07:37] giving substance for what is hope for
[2:07:40] faith is the grasping of under militant
[2:07:45] realities of hope and bringing them into
[2:07:47] the realm of reality and he said faith
[2:07:52] grows out of the Word of God it is the
[2:07:55] warranty deed that the thing for which
[2:07:57] you have fondly hoped for is that last
[2:07:59] yours
[2:08:00] it is the evidence of things not seen
[2:08:03] your hope for finances to meet that
[2:08:06] obligation faith gives assurance that
[2:08:08] you'll have the money when you need it
[2:08:10] you hope for physical strength to do the
[2:08:13] work that you know you must do faith
[2:08:16] says God is the strength of my life of
[2:08:18] whom shall I be afraid since knowledge
[2:08:21] have give to the church mental assent
[2:08:24] which looks so much like faith that that
[2:08:27] many people cannot see that
[2:08:28] efforts mental assent is seeing it at
[2:08:31] mine it and saying is true but not in my
[2:08:34] case
[2:08:36] minimal sip agrees that the Bible is a
[2:08:39] revelation that it came from God and
[2:08:41] ever word is true
[2:08:42] yet when the crisis comes it does not
[2:08:45] work it simply recognizes the
[2:08:47] truthfulness of that wonderful book but
[2:08:50] does not act upon it hope says I will
[2:08:53] get it sometime faith says I have it now
[2:08:56] middle Asim says it's beautiful I know I
[2:08:59] should have it for some reason I don't
[2:09:02] get it I cannot understand it since
[2:09:04] knowledge says when I see it or when I
[2:09:07] feel it I don't know a habit real faith
[2:09:10] and the word says if God said it's true
[2:09:13] idiots if he says by His stripes I'm
[2:09:17] healed
[2:09:17] I am if God says he will supply ever
[2:09:21] need of mine he will do it if he says I
[2:09:24] am the strength of your life he is a
[2:09:27] meant so I go about doing my work
[2:09:29] because he is what he says he is and I
[2:09:32] am what he says I am a man I if he says
[2:09:37] I am strong I am if he says I am healed
[2:09:41] I am if he says he cares for me I know
[2:09:45] he does and my real faith is built on
[2:09:49] the word faith since the results of the
[2:09:51] word dwelling in us he says I don't mean
[2:09:54] the word committed to memory I mean the
[2:09:57] word live practice until it becomes a
[2:09:59] part of it we meditated upon it we think
[2:10:03] deeply on it we feed upon it and the
[2:10:06] word becomes a very part of ourselves
[2:10:08] this word of faith builds us into
[2:10:10] confidence and assurance so let's just
[2:10:17] mind being you God condescended to
[2:10:22] become a man for the purpose of
[2:10:25] redemption and he humbled himself to the
[2:10:29] will and the word of the Father he left
[2:10:34] his god ship to become a man and he's
[2:10:37] asking you to put off your humanity
[2:10:41] your old man what you're seeing taste
[2:10:44] and smell and feeling here and realize
[2:10:47] your sonship receiving the renewed mind
[2:10:52] surrendering your own thinking to a
[2:10:54] higher thinking to be able to think
[2:10:56] God's thoughts of yourself and sons of
[2:10:59] God operating with his mind that's what
[2:11:02] God wants to do with his people and when
[2:11:05] you have been called in the message the
[2:11:08] bride is a little faith woman a woman of
[2:11:11] faith a man brother Branham said when a
[2:11:14] man lives by faith and walks by faith he
[2:11:17] said I mean sets in faith he is isolated
[2:11:20] from the entire world becomes a new
[2:11:23] creature in Christ there now you're
[2:11:25] getting the bride material you're
[2:11:27] getting a rapture in condition now a man
[2:11:30] he says he said that means so much to us
[2:11:33] he said not just for the pastor the
[2:11:35] Deacons a trustee means for the lady
[2:11:37] every individual walks in the world with
[2:11:40] God alone you're baptized in his kingdom
[2:11:42] there's nobody in there but you and God
[2:11:45] he gives you the orders and you pack
[2:11:47] them out whatever he says there's no
[2:11:50] sign of it out nowhere you walk right on
[2:11:52] a man if the Lord says this there's no
[2:11:55] one in the world can talk you out of it
[2:11:57] you're going to see you're gonna write
[2:12:00] the same you come into the perfect paper
[2:12:02] perfect perfection that cannot fail that
[2:12:05] faith never fails a man as we said if
[2:12:10] he's coming he's coming and bringing
[2:12:12] forth of his own kind let me just share
[2:12:14] this the church the true bride that
[2:12:17] church or church bride comes to the
[2:12:19] headstone will be a super Church Oh
[2:12:22] super race as she nears that great
[2:12:26] headstone there'll be so much like him
[2:12:29] to there be in his very image in order
[2:12:33] to be united with him they will be one
[2:12:35] they will be the manifestation of the
[2:12:38] word of the Living God
[2:12:40] I want you to know this was something
[2:12:43] that was put on the proper sphere to
[2:12:45] write about you this is thus saith the
[2:12:48] Lord
[2:12:48] about what you will be
[2:12:51] a super race of super jerks as you near
[2:12:55] that great head so and we're closer now
[2:12:57] than we've ever been
[2:12:59] hey man this is a prophecy of the bride
[2:13:02] I wonder who is willing to who do who is
[2:13:05] willing to to go from questioning how
[2:13:08] can these things be to be it unto me
[2:13:11] according I word a man that brought that
[2:13:14] disrupt Mary from Berenice to be
[2:13:17] impregnable spirit and that's the only
[2:13:20] thing that will bring a parent Church
[2:13:22] filled with life is what weeks
[2:13:25] quick question inhale and start
[2:13:28] accepting the promise for ourselves amen
[2:13:35] we are to express his mind because we
[2:13:38] have his mind we have eternal life
[2:13:42] that's God's own life brother Brennan
[2:13:45] said you received it like it was on the
[2:13:47] day of pinnacles and he said and through
[2:13:49] this the mind of Christ should be
[2:13:51] operating among us this brings us in a
[2:13:56] harmony with the word amen were we in
[2:13:59] Christ becomes one let me just skip on
[2:14:01] down to some things as we try to get
[2:14:04] there get here because I want you to
[2:14:06] understand the mind of Christ is to be
[2:14:08] in the bride as it was in the groom a
[2:14:12] man these these are these are apostolic
[2:14:16] times as brother Brennan said I'm trying
[2:14:18] to get the church into the place where
[2:14:21] we can really see apostolic times
[2:14:26] sometimes you wonder brother Jim why are
[2:14:28] you preaching this way because if it
[2:14:31] promised Amen because this is what God
[2:14:36] said a bride would be in the end time
[2:14:38] amen he said I'm training at the church
[2:14:41] to the place where we can really see
[2:14:43] apostolic times moving among us that's
[2:14:45] what we all hunger and it's laying right
[2:14:48] at the door I wonder he'll knock on that
[2:14:52] door
[2:14:53] no wonder who'll ask and keep on asking
[2:14:56] a man he said we see it and we have but
[2:15:00] we want to see more of it
[2:15:02] we want it to be such a flow that'd be a
[2:15:04] help to us and flow out to others hey
[2:15:08] man these let me just let me just
[2:15:10] clarify some things can I speak from my
[2:15:12] heart for a moment
[2:15:13] these apostolic times promise are not
[2:15:17] the repeat of the turmoil and the strife
[2:15:20] that was found in the book of Acts and
[2:15:23] Men those were the acts of called me the
[2:15:27] apostolic times promised for the results
[2:15:30] of the original vine putting forth
[2:15:33] another branch from itself and the Holy
[2:15:36] Spirit acting the believer as he did
[2:15:38] back then listen it's important how how
[2:15:47] we preach these things and the slant
[2:15:51] we're preaching them in because I'm
[2:15:56] going to tell you a lot of these things
[2:15:57] are not being preached with negativity
[2:16:00] instead of a positive gospel let me just
[2:16:05] read it to you from brother Branham this
[2:16:07] quote stuck out to me this week that is
[2:16:09] I come across it I was looking for the
[2:16:11] word unction because I want to unction
[2:16:14] of the Holy Ghost I'm looking for that
[2:16:16] impulse I want it for me I want it for
[2:16:20] you brother Branham said and it wasn't
[2:16:25] so from the beginning this was spoken
[2:16:26] three-port let's go back to the real
[2:16:29] first light the old Pentecostal blessing
[2:16:33] and the power of the Holy Ghost back in
[2:16:34] the church they put it all on the
[2:16:38] preacher today it ain't the preacher the
[2:16:43] Holy Ghost is just as much to the laity
[2:16:45] as it is in the preacher he ain't got
[2:16:49] all the religion they got it out there
[2:16:52] and I'm one today that believes we ought
[2:16:54] to get the Spirit of God back in the
[2:16:56] church what we can have the gifts of the
[2:16:59] Spirit in with unction and power but
[2:17:03] today we find men we're in the beginning
[2:17:05] of the church age I'm teaching all next
[2:17:06] week at my tavern Akal at home to write
[2:17:08] a little commentary as I my comments on
[2:17:11] it my own comments on it you notice it
[2:17:13] started as the deeds of the Nicolaitans
[2:17:16] and after a while it became a doctrine
[2:17:18] well what it is it taken all this period
[2:17:22] away from the congregation and made
[2:17:26] bishops and overseers and Pope's and put
[2:17:29] it all in the Pope head and the Pope had
[2:17:31] got intellectual there you got a hybrid
[2:17:35] Church again under intellectual God send
[2:17:38] us back the Holy Ghost amongst the
[2:17:40] people
[2:17:41] let the option of the spirit move among
[2:17:44] the people given forth messages and
[2:17:47] power and manifestation if we have to
[2:17:49] stand on the street corner or get in a
[2:17:51] chicken house or a barn somewhere we
[2:17:55] don't want any of this hybrid religion
[2:17:57] come out of the similar we want to come
[2:17:59] like a rushing mighty wind from all from
[2:18:02] on high that fills all the house not
[2:18:05] just one man but all the house were
[2:18:07] there seated perversion is what the man
[2:18:10] did in the days of the Lord Jesus that's
[2:18:12] what he's trying to do today take the
[2:18:14] things that are original and pervert
[2:18:16] them by his own ideas and he ruins his
[2:18:18] self what was that what came under day
[2:18:25] of Pentecost the same breath of God that
[2:18:31] breathed upon Adam and became a living
[2:18:34] soul the same Jesus that breathed on the
[2:18:39] disciples and their and their soul
[2:18:45] became alive with the Holy Ghost that
[2:18:48] breath of God became a wound and they're
[2:18:51] filled up with the Holy Ghost I'm saying
[2:18:59] that Jesus breathed on you today and
[2:19:03] fill you again with the spirit it can't
[2:19:07] be just an anointed man in the pulpit

[2:19:12] pew it can't be just a man in the pulpit

[2:19:22] being led by the Holy Ghost being spoke
[2:19:25] to by the voice of God of people who
[2:19:27] know their
[2:19:28] God backs out new exploits are you with
[2:19:34] me

[2:37:08] life today let it move in your heart
[2:37:12] take out that unbelief the Lord has no
[2:37:14] spirit
[2:37:15] I want to believe from the heart I've
[2:37:19] had a lot of hit believing head
[2:37:20] knowledge but I want to bleed from the
[2:37:22] heart so I can confess it with my mouth
[2:37:25] and then my testimony will match in
[2:37:29] Jesus name
[2:37:31] just love him now

[2:38:21] we pray for you right now
[2:38:23] or Jesus you sit for us to submit
[2:38:27] ourselves to God and then resist the
[2:38:31] devil and he shall flee close nor today
[2:38:35] we repent in your presence Lord we just
[2:38:37] say we're sorry for every time that
[2:38:41] we've been going about what we see what
[2:38:44] we feel what we hear instead of what
[2:38:46] your word says
[2:38:49] surely Lord you understand we're human
[2:38:51] that's why you came down among us so you
[2:38:55] can feel what we feel and go through
[2:38:56] what we go through
[2:38:58] I'm so glad Lord you always state with
[2:39:01] the father's word even though even
[2:39:05] though your own wheel would say let it
[2:39:08] pass from me yet you kept on to you
[2:39:11] found but the father's wheel once no
[2:39:16] that's what we want in our lives we want
[2:39:19] your wheel we want to make us
[2:39:23] surrendered so our lives today to your
[2:39:25] wheel Lord I want to surrender mine to
[2:39:27] you I want to do what you believe me to
[2:39:32] do I would be led by the spirit Lord
[2:39:36] when I read the Bible here in the
[2:39:41] message Lord when I can hear I'm a
[2:39:45] little head Jemima type woman
[2:39:48] with a rag around her head it's led by
[2:39:52] the Spirit of God sees in a dream her
[2:39:57] subconscious that Elijah was gonna come
[2:40:02] and pray for her baby her little her
[2:40:05] young man who was dying of syphilis
[2:40:07] poisoning his sister and that woman's
[2:40:13] faith would hold the plane down till
[2:40:16] that prophet that Elijah would come down
