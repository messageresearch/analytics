we commit this service to you father for your glory and for your honor lord may the word strike the mark we pray we ask it in jesus name amen amen turn back to the scriptures second corinthians 10 and verse 4 amen it's good to be in the house of the lord amen i'd like to speak to you again on casting down imaginations but to focus in on the stronghold of unbelief stronghold of unbelief second corinthians 10 and verse 4 says for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ amen we'll let you be seated amen stronghold of unbelief unbelief is the lack of rich religious beliefs or the absence of faith the absence of faith you know in hebrews 11 would tell us without faith it is impossible to please god amen for he that cometh to god must believe that he is first you got to believe that there is a god amen that and then when you come to him that not only is he god but he's a rewarder of those who diligently seek him amen and i believe that the keynote of the scriptures or to accept anything from god is faith he that cometh to god must believe that he is you know we're living in a world that's as we're going to get into this as getting further and further away from god their thoughts are getting further and further away from god their mind is on evil as the bible would say on evil continually but there has to be a people here that still has faith as we heard sunday amen you know i i i just want to emphasize something here as we get started we've been speaking about strongholds but these strongholds are not here to overcome you these strongholds are here for you to tear them down and this is what we read in our scripture this we we're weapons that we're fighting with are not carnal but they're mighty through god to the pulling down of stronghold so the scripture is already showing us that those strongholds that we're speaking about must come down and will come down and they will come down by faith amen without faith it is impossible to please god the whole world as we know it today was made by faith things were shaped into existence by faith god spoke the word and said let there be light and there was light and then he brought the land forth and he dried it out and he brought trees and birds and all the wildlife that we have today amen by faith that was all done by act of faith of god the whole world is made by faith amen we believe in creation by faith amen for that matter people believe in evolution by faith amen has to seem to me more faith to believe in evolution than it would to be and believe in a god who can say let there be but many many you know many of us are even operating that way in us in our subconscious amen by faith not even realizing you know you say well i'm going to go do this tomorrow i'm going to go home tonight and i'm going to do a certain thing and all right you know i told your boss you're going to do something tomorrow what was you doing he was doing that by faith amen you know you know we don't know how what time will be we may be in eternity by 11 o'clock tonight praise the lord but everything that we do is really by faith you have to believe amen you have to believe that you're going to do something for it to be accomplished in your life amen faith he that cometh to god must believe that he is it is impossible to please him without faith you cannot please god and if you say you believe god you say well i've never seen him see so then you've got to believe it by faith amen god is not believed by see taste smell of field or hair you see he is believed by faith anything that the census declares there's no more faith it's it's maybe a scientific fact or a human fact or or or take taste or feel fact but i mean god is not declared by those things he's only declared by faith and you have to accept him by faith and he that cometh to god must believe that god and faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of god you must first believe that you've heard god's word and you must come to god by the word you take the word and say that's right that's all there is to it i'm not taking anything else everything else is contrary to the word i'm not going to believe amen but i'm going to believe what god said and abraham you know had to believe just what that voice told him to believe amen he had to believe that when he was 100 years old 25 years later he was stronger believing he was 25 years along in the promise but he was stronger in the faith amen giving praise to god knowing the god who said it at the beginning no long no matter how long that it takes to come to pass he will bring it to pass and i believe there's a people in this age that has has heard the voice of the living god speak to them and they know that whatever he said he's going to bring it to pass time circumstances has no bearing on god amen but there's going to be a people holding on as we heard sunday amen but unbelief is the root of sin amen people do things they do whether it be smoking or drinking or or adulteries or anything that we would classify a sin they do it because of unbelief amen if they believed god or believed his principles or believed the word of god and the and the and the judgment that would come from doing those things they wouldn't do that if they believed the word of god but because of unbelief because satan has sprayed some unbelief in their life somewhere they would go commit these acts why they don't believe god's word they don't believe there's a judgment they don't believe there's a fulfillment of his word and unbelief has now entered many times over and over into the hearts of men and we see it we know where unbelief came from it came and entered into the heart at the fall amen when eve was reasoning and and and with the serpent and unbelief came into her life now as brother branham would teach us he said sin is unbelief for the first sin was committed by eve because she disbelieved god's word now the act that followed was only because of unbelief amen the act you know was not the sin the sin was disbelieving in god's word amen so because she disbelieved god's word the whole thing tonight and the chaos that we're living in calls by one person disbelieving god's word amen see sin he says there's only one sin that's unbelief a man that drinks isn't that's not the sin it isn't sin it isn't a sin to drink wow it isn't a sin to commit adultery to lies still that isn't sin that's the attributes of unbelief unbelief is a sin if you was a believer you wouldn't do that hallelujah there's only two you're either an unbeliever or a believer i know people want to say well i want to do my own thing and i'm just going to be my i'm not going to serve god you're going to serve one or the other there's two forces in this world there's a god or satan very simple you're going to either serve one or the other amen you can't serve both amen so you're going to either be an unbeliever or a believer one or the other you don't do these things and religious things that you do just because you're an unbeliever you do it because you're a believer in the word of god because christ is the word and you believe his word you're just an unbeliever because you maybe and so you're just an unbeliever because that you believe some tradition or some dogma that's been added to the bible or something like denomination but a real believer always stays with the word amen stays with the word he said he says in another place it says unbelief as it is as old as eden that's where that was born at in eden unbelief is to doubt what god said to doubt what god said and that can go for any promises laying here in the bible to doubt that he has the power to fulfill a promise is unbelief to doubt that he cannot no longer heal the sick that's unbelief to doubt that he can no longer save or he can no longer do the things that god does that's unbelief amen and this is where sin comes from and then attributes of sin comes from it comes from unbelief when she said god said what was it satan began to spray his unbelief in there and begin to twist it a little bit and take you only apart but to very well very one little bit from god's word brings you into unbelief and we should say you know and if we should have any revelation should be presented us that's contrary to the written word we should never receive it it has to come from the word and that's why i'm thankful we're we're living in a message or believing a message that that we can always take back to the bible because the bible is god's written word and if there's anything that you believe that's in the message that's not in the word of god that's not the message but the message is christ the man the message is his word and his word will always amen go back to what it says there in the scripture and you can find it but satan since the fall has begun to spray more and more of his unbelief trying to get people to disbelieve because he knows if he can get them to disbelieve what god said they will miss what god is doing amen if he can get them to miss what god or undone to to not believe what god has spoken amen what happened to esau he traded the birthright for spottage because of unbelief amen lot went to sodom because of unbelief data and core stood against moses because of unbelief the ten spies refused to go in because of unbelief the children of israel agreed with the ten spies and went back into the wilderness why because of unbelief it wasn't that truth wasn't there amen truth is always there but it's whether you will believe truth or not amen they were gay men they were the israel was given over to other nations because of unbelief they didn't possess all the promised land why because of unbelief amen they hid in their tents it wouldn't take goliath's challenge why because of unbelief unbelief took control of them to the point amen as he began to spray it out more and more into the israel into their lives i mean my goodness you can hear god would say i am the lord god you shall have no other gods before me and it wasn't too long because of unbelief they began to build high places and groves and sacrifice to other gods and bring other gods why because of unbelief because if they had really believed him they wouldn't have done those things amen the world that we're in is in the chaos because of unbelief amen we see israel as they review could watch them all down through the scriptures the old testament they come even to the point of the scriptures being fulfilled in a body called jesus the messiah off of paper in the flesh right before their very eyes and they missed him because he got them to disbelieve the word and it came a different way you know the world that we're living in is very dangerous and very vile and very wicked and it's that way because of unbelief you know we're smarter than we've ever been since the flood of the time of noah but further away from god so if it smarts is getting us somewhere i don't like where we're going amen amen we've been we're more scientific we have more scientific advancements but further away from god what satan is doing a good job of spraying his poison of unbelief and is turning this world into complete chaos into complete darkness into amen uh just utter utter violence and everything that's going on you know that brother bannon would tell a story about a man that was in a war and he had been a chaplain and and he you know been working on some guys and he he went outside and the chaplain said officer come to and said chaplain i want you to take a ride for me to go look at the fields i have some things i need to check out and see if we can use again and he said they had thrown out this mustard or chlorine gas as they did in them days and he said i got there brother branham there wasn't a bark left on the tree there wasn't a sprig of grass there wasn't there wasn't nothing on it i i wa here was easter morning there was nothing but old wrecked tanks and and just nothing but destruction and i see myself looking up and i said oh god this is the way it's all coming to it's all coming to this place it'll all be burned up there'll be no life nowhere grass burn off trees burned up gases killed trees everything was killed twisted up metals and hanging but where bullets and things have written he said if that isn't a picture of the world today where satan is praying his unbelief his hybrid his science his knowledge until it's come from a garden of eden into satan's eden into complete chaos into a war zone that's what's left of this world chaos it's complete total rejection of anything holy or anything righteous or anything godly they don't want god in their jobs they don't want god in their schools they want god in their lives they don't want god anywhere they want to just go around their life and just act like there isn't even a god he said i started crying and i walked back he said but i was attracted to a rock and i went over and looked at that rock and pushed it over and down underneath that rock was this little most beautiful white flower growing it was only seemed like living thing left because he had been sheltered by a rock he said god is my rock he's my shelter in this time of poisonings that are flying everywhere in the name of science and education and godliness he said oh god keep me in that day shelter me in the rock i was looking at this as i began to look at unbelief and actually found this interesting article written in the national geographic magazine in april 22 of 2016. so almost what five years ago it says the headlines was the world's newest major religion no religion he said you it's beginning to speak and i read some of this it says you usually don't think of churches as going out of business but it's happening and it's even progressively gotten worse as we know we've come a long ways in just four years or five whatever it is in march it talks about a certain church that held their last collective service he said you know it was actually the uk mennonites he said it said it might be easily predicted that the plain dressed anabaptists who follow a faith related to amish would become irrelevant in the age of smartphones but this is part of a larger trend around the world when asked about their feelings on religion more and more people are responding with a man i think that's why we got to be real careful what our response is amen towards the things of god is more than man it's life amen the religiously unaffiliated called nuns that's interesting name but it's not n-u-n it's n-o-n-e-s nuns are growing significantly they're actually this is in 2016. they're the second largest religious group in north america and most of europe in the united states nuns makes up a quarter of the population in the past decade u.s nuns have overtaken catholic mainline protestants and all followers of non-christian faith the lack of religious affiliation has profound effect on how people think about death how they teach their kids and even how they vote they have long been predictions that religion would fade from revelancy as the world modernizes notice as the world modernizes but all the recent surveys are finding that it's happening startingly fast france will have a majority secular population soon so when netherlands and new zealand the united kingdom and australia will soon lose in christian majority majorities religion is rapidly becoming less important than it's ever been even to people who live in countries where faith has affected everything from rulers to borders to architect and we have a new group it's called millennials anybody's heard millennials millennials to god no thanks if the world is at a religious precipice or a cliff then we have been moving slowly toward it for decades 50 years ago time magazine had a headline you can go look it up it just did asking a famous headline on the front cover is god dead now that's quite interesting that the year after the prophet leaves the scene april 19 19 1966 this this magazine would come out is god dead the magazine wondered whether religion was relevant to modern life in a post-atomic age when communism was spreading and science was explaining more about our natural world than ever before this is not a christian article this is this is a secular article this is what they're saying we're still asking the same question but the response isn't limited to yes or no a chunk of the population born after the article was printed may respond with a provocative question with god who so is god dead god who in europe and north this is where unbelief has taken us america started out on some beliefs on beliefs of a god and and religious freedoms and things but unbelief begin to come in amen you can see it in churches when a lot revival to happen it'll turn them back to god but and then they'll straighten up their dress they're straightening up their act their talk their ways and things will begin to happen but all of a sudden unbelief will begin to step in and before you know it they're so far away from what they used to be amen we know we know that to be the truth was right over there and and texas camp they're having our family camp and that man at that nazarene camp come to our services and he said we used to have services like this that's why we don't want to get to where our services is just a mess to us just a common thing or the movement of the holy ghost is something common it ought to be something that stirs our hearts amen it ought to be something that grips us and say hey i have a privilege out of all the people on the earth to be in the presence of the king [Applause] amen before you know it your life will get to god who in europe and north america the unaffiliated tend to be several years younger than the population average and this is this is in 1970 listen 11 of americans born after 1970 were raised in secular homes there's no telling what the percentage is now now notice where they pointed to this is their their article scientific advancement isn't just making people question god it's also connecting those to who to who question it's also connecting those who question it's not just making them question god this advancement is also connected people to other connect you know to have sympathy one with the other it is easy to find atheists and agnostic groups you know even if you come from a religious family or community and anyone who wants companionship that might otherwise come from a church can attend a secular sunday assembly or or a pla a plethora of meetups for humanists atheists agnostics or skeptics they're everywhere he said but it's you know they do make this some thoughts it was quite humorous he said it's not easy to unite people around not believing in something said organizing atheists is like hurting cats this is their eye this is theirs but lots of cats have found their way to the meowri and then it goes on the privilege of not believing can you believe it the privilege of not believing there's a few theory theories about why people become atheists in in large numbers some demographers uh attributed to financial security which would explain why european countries with a stronger social safety net are more secular than the united states where poverty is more common in a medical emergency can bankrupt even the uninsured so it's telling you that you got money you're less likely to depend upon god it's proven amen right there atheist atheism is also tied to education this is their article measured by academic achievement and and general knowledge of of the panoply of beliefs or the many beliefs around the world amen is showing where they are being tied to you know there was two spirits that marveled jesus there was one a spirit of unbelief and the other was a spirit of faith there's two spirits that operate in the lives of human beings all the time until you decide and make up your mind that you're going to believe the word of god regardless of circumstances good regardless of what's around you whether your friends leaving you you're not going to move you're not going to move away from it but until you come to that moment you're wavering between two opinions you're wavering between belief and unbelief and faith as a matter of fact as a prophet in the bible said how long elijah said how long will you halt between two opinions how did they get there because they begin to worship baal instead of god and they're brought to mount carmel and he says how long are you going to halt between two opinions if they'll be god's servant but if god be god serve him and i believe that's the way we ought to be amen if god is godless serving with all of our heart and he has proved himself over and over and over to be god it's actually a sin for us to disbelieve with all that we have seen and our eyes have witnessed it's a sin to disbelieve god in the hour that we live in we can read about it in mark 6 and verse 3. it says they said is this not the carpenter listen to the unbelief oh but they're stating facts but it's unbelief this is is this not the carpenter the son of mary the brother james and joseph and of judah and simon are no are not his sisters here with us and they were offended at him and jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house and he could do there no he could there do no mighty work say that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them i don't want that kind of testimony i want to have a place where god can do mighty works i want our church to be a place that god can do mighty works i don't want to as we heard sunday i don't want him coming through this building and looking to see if there's faith amen brother brandon would be preaching and he'd bring it down to the discernment you can hear him time after time as he begins to wait upon the angel of god and he'd say here he's here and he began to pull out things out of people's life and we get a speak thing and all of a sudden he said it looks like it's getting milky in here he said what is it he said it's faith he said faith is beginning to rise up in people and they're casting down imaginations this is what's happening they're casting down imagination there was a lot of imagination that were going on you can hear he said some of you are thinking this is just uh just uh what is it yeah mental telepathy some of y'all just thinking this is a bunch of hocus pocus he said don't do that just believe amen and when belief starts taking place god can then start working and god can do mighty acts and god can heal cancer why because faith struck a building faith struck a heart god can heal alopecia why faith struck a heart i can i will i do believe what was a mirai doing she was breaking down the stronghold of unbelief unbelief was trying to show her all the signs of her hair falling out and the impossibilities doctors were saying but she turned all the unbelief down and she believed in a god who's more than faithful until the hair began to come out of her head amen i'm looking at a bride that's going to look away from all the unbelief and the naysaying and the impossibilities until they take a step into a new body why because they broke through the stronghold of unbelief and he marveled because of their unbelief i wonder how many message churches god's come to and marveled matthew 8 and verse 8 says the centurion answered and said lord i'm not worthy that thou would has come unto my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed what what did he say he went back to the word speak the word for i'm a man of authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go when he goes and another come and he cometh and then my servant do this and he'd do with it when jesus heard it he marveled amen he said unto them following verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel but satan is always trying to block he's always trying to build a stronghold to keep god's promise from coming to pass if he can get people to disbelieve they are defeated amen if but if god can get people to believe they can be victorious listen you must refuse to accept the voice of unbelief because it's a loud voice in the age that we're living in unbelief is on every website it's on every page it's on everything all around us on every billboard and every store there's unbelief everywhere and the voice of unbelief is getting louder and louder and louder and what is the voice trying to do it's trying to drown out the voice of faith it's trying to drown out the voice of god amen if you have to refuse to accept the voice of unbelief and choose to believe and put an expectation on a supernatural god did you hear that you got to refuse to accept the voice of unbelief and say lord i believe and when you say lord i believe you put an expectation on a supernatural god that god is more than able no matter what the circumstances god can do it when i can't even see how to do it god will break down through every wall he'll break down through every truck every kind of sin whatever he's got to do i know some of your parents the voice of unbelief is trying to whisper in your ear and tell you there's no hope for your child there's no way he's going to come back there's no way she's gonna she don't went too far that's the voice of unbelief but we're gonna cast the voice of unbelief and we're gonna say lord i believe and when you say lord i believe you're putting an expectation on a supernatural god that'll break the walls of doubt and fear and break through everything he's got to get to to get your lost daughter and son hallelujah come on somebody it's a people here that's going to break through the stronghold [Applause] amen it was unbelief to try to tell some of y'all that you would never mount to nothing try to tell you never be anybody but a drunk or a druggie trying to tell you never but all of a sudden you heard another voice it was a voice of an eagle that said no that's not who you are you never did belong in that old drug power you never did belong in that old sin world that's not who you are there's another voice calling you it is a voice of resurrection hallelujah that breaks through the stronghold hallelujah satan tried to put all kind of stronghold around you all kind of thick walls of unbelief amen even in some of you that's been raised in this message he tried to put strongholds of unbelief around you it says a message ain't for you you might as well leave and ain't for you ain't he's talking to somebody else he's not talking to you you got to turn down that voice of unbelief and say that's not the voice i'm tuning into but i heard another voice just as abraham heard a voice i heard a voice and that voice said you are my son that voice said you are my daughter that voice said you are my i put you for here for a purpose hallelujah you think god allowed this one to come together and your great-granddaddies and grandmama's all the way down here and bring you and put some of you right and believe in homes on accident no he has a plan for you he has a purpose for you but the devil is lying to some of you and saying that ain't for you that's a voice of unbelief abraham was sitting at the door of his tent on a real hot day must have been louisiana real hot day lots of complaints coming in lately by the herdsmen grass is gone land drying up cattle was becoming very thin water supply gone almost they found a few water holes and they were getting low and they dug dug till they couldn't find no more he said it was a very dark day he says we know by nature that is darkest just before day and many times when we see this that this uh disastrous things happening especially as believers we must bear this in mind that satan is trying to block a blessing come on now satan's trying to block a blessing amen it's very much to get so in this case satan was trying to tip them tempt them to feel they had done wrong did you hear that unbelief was whispered in abraham's ear you done wrong that's why you're having all the trouble you're having that's why you don't have no grass that's why you don't have no money in the bank that's why your job's falling apart because you've done wrong yeah he's trying to tempt them with unbelief that they had done wrong he was trying to block the oncoming visitation that god was going to give abraham and sarah hello somebody don't you know how it is on a sunday morning or wednesday things get all in a stir and it's a very hot day maybe not temperature wise but maybe temper wise [Laughter] oh yeah we got one honest heart in here the rest of us uh us christians have been a long while we don't we you know we don't like to admit to those kind of days but it's a hot day sometimes you got things going things went wrong at work things went what is it god god it's trying to let you know satan's trying to block a blessing so he's trying to whisper every kind of unbelief why don't you just stay home tonight you'd be better off just streaming why why don't you just stay home and just enjoy the couch and then we can fix a good old glass of tea and we just have us a good old unbelief trying to come into your life knowing that the word of god says to get to church come on for the sake not the assembling of yourself together amen we've had to use streaming a whole lot more than normal but that's not really what it's intended for amen uh if you're healthy and ready and and you're willing to go to church or have something in your heart you ought to be in church amen but satan comes and he tries to say well you just had too bad a day you ought not go you're going to be a distraction you're not going to be but what is trying to distract you from getting a blessing he's trying to distract you from receiving something from god do you realize some of those services that you could have been in might have been the time that god had dropped in the faith drug god had dropped in the power and god had dropped in the service that the thing that you've been dealing with from years could have just vanished i read this i've had this in my i hadn't preached for here for a little bit so i've been working on this but i reread this yesterday he said satan is trying to tempt you to feel you've done wrong trying to block an oncoming visitation that god was going to give abraham and sarah he said and we're taught in the scriptures that all things work together for good to them that love god and no matter how bad it seems remember it has to be working for your good oh he said i'm so glad of that he said satan's been after me all day i just believe there's a blessing in store here today somewhere i know when he tempts me and he tries to block it out what's he trying to do get you to disbelieve the worst thing you can do is disbelieve god and as soon as you get a little scared well maybe i haven't done this or haven't done that and i've done something wrong satan's got that blessing conquered right then you can't get to it as long as satan makes you think like that but it's time you begin to think differently i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god amen i can look in the old testament and i can see where abraham's sin i can see his wrongs i can see his mistakes on the blood of bulls and goats but under the new covenant the blood of jesus christ as brother philip sung about the cross that i'm clinging to it was a different kind of blood it's so rewrote abraham's life that you can read there after that new covenant and it says he staggered not at the promises of god but was strong in the faith giving praise to god and we are under the same covenant god i mean what you some of you need to realize it ain't a bunch of lousy lousy wounds and so feeling defeated all the time lift up your head and realize you got a sacrifice and it's not the blood of bulls and ghosts it's the sacrifice of the perfect lamb of god and he struck away all your debts it struck away everything that was against you and it said you could go free so cast down that old wowzy wowzy woo spirit and so i'm not gonna bow to you no more cast down that bar that feeling of unworthiness and impossibility and say i'm not gonna do that no more i am a son of god that's nothing but unbelief trying to come into your heart he's trying to tell some of your girls you ain't worthy get your pures a lily he's trying to tell you it's impossible for you to make it but you've already been there seen them [Applause] hallelujah oh glory to caught in the highest amen but a satan long as satan makes you think like that you'll never receive nothing from god he said perhaps if we would listen to such things of temptations like that and pay attention to them it would be that we would miss the blessing he said it's on my mind now to tell this particular case how i was trying to find a place to pray he said god led me into the wilderness way down in southern indiana where a little girl was laying on a bed of affliction tuberculosis said she had not raised her head from the pillow for nine years and eight months she belonged to a church that did not believe in divine healing i'm going to tell you if you're listening tonight and you are in the church that don't believe in divine healing get out because it ain't that ain't the word of god his word don't change your dogmas and your own church ideas may change but god's word don't change so if your father when you're when you're following a church like that you're following man and you're some way off somewhere going straight to hell because god don't deny his word but unbelief had tried to to camp out even in this girl's family in her daddy in the church he was a deacon in the church and his mother mama you know just totally ate up with unbelief to where they did they didn't they didn't even think god could even even do anything anymore and didn't want brother branham to even come around because they thought he was giving her false hope tell me how is getting healed false hope how has somebody got in such a condition or a position or place in their life that they believe they believe healing is a false hope when it's the word of god amen see i said i've been taking over he said taking over a circuit milltown baptist church me and brother joe and brother aaron had the privilege of going and being at this little town and looking over this place and the lord had been going there preaching the revival and the lord had been doing some great things and they sent me to pray for this little girl she was about 17 years old very critical condition her name was georgie carter and the good brother who had taken me over there her father though was a deacon in this church did not believe in divine healing made a statement if any of the members went up to the baptist church while i was praying for sit for the sick it would be excommunicated from the church i would be on my way but her father being a deacon it kind of put him in an awful place but he said i went to see the little girl and her mother went out of the room and her father left the house and they wouldn't have nothing to do with it but that little girl had read a book that i'd written called jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and when i went to her room she could not even raise her hands to hold her cup to spit in what she had coughed she weighed maybe 35 40 pounds looked like her little legs just way thinner than the florence nightingales and the pitcher that was healed of cancer and i prayed for her and she asked me if she was going to be able to walk and i said sister the angel of the lord had spoke to me and told me to go up in that country hunt that little girl up but i i don't know i i don't know and after the revival was going on for two weeks and was coming down to the end of it he said he he was out baptizing 150 people nearly in the water there at tottens ford and said i went to dinner afterwards some friends and old friend of mine by the name of george wright and said some something began to press on me said go into the wilderness and pray and i just couldn't get it off my mind he said you know when anything presses you like that you go do it because it's the holy spirit because the devil ain't gonna tell you go pray amen but see swatch now when he tells you something there's going to be something rise up to try to block it amen i remember last year as as brother ron would feel to feel the need to see as he showed up on a wednesday night surprised a lot of you with brother andrew i remember he was preaching that couple sundays or so before and just felt the need i got to go to homer i got to go to louisiana 17 hours to be prayed for it was something pushing him a devil ain't going to tell you to do that amen and then he said i've got to get there and and and the next that was sunday and after that i called him just just a week of my mom's major brain bleed on monday as i was traveling up into oklahoma i called him was talking to him about that and making plans and he said you know at the very end of the conversation he said now watch he said when god's fixing to do something satan always tries to stop it and it was just a few days later my mom's laying in the hospital in an impossible situation and with a brain bleed and it seemed like impossible to ever be back to normal have normal functions but satan tried to stop it but he missed satan will try but that don't mean he succeeds the gates of hell will be against it but it will not prevail hallelujah it shows that the gates of hell is going to be against you but it won't prevail the demons of sickness is going to be against you but it won't prevail amen demons of sin are coming and doubts and unbelief will try to come against you but it won't prevail said he started pushing into the woods to go pray said mr wright had told him to go he said i got a dinner bell i'll ring when it's time for supper he said okay so the service was about to close went up the hill and started to kneel down so all of a sudden greenbriar started cutting me moved over a little far further and so rough on the ground rocks i couldn't get comfortable went around the other side of the hill leaning too much sideways you know the devil was trying to keep you from getting the blessing that's all it was when i climbed up a little further than the thicket i knelt down mosquitoes were humming around my ears i couldn't hardly play pray i believed then it was the devil hello sometimes you don't realize sometimes when a blessing's on the way and all of a sudden you feel the urge to get up and go outside come on now you feel the urge to move and fidget and this that and the other and be distracted no think about it's the devil he said i said oh lord god be merciful when i realized what was going on i said oh lord lord god be merciful said i threw up my hands and started praying anyhow and just let the mosquitoes fill up if they wanted to you have to completely ignore them that's what you got to do with the devil ignore him amen turn it and turn your ear off to him he said but there was something that was burning my heart and after a while i became lost in prayer he said i guess you christians know what it means to be lost in prayer just forget about where you are that's praying in the spirit i believe i opened my eyes and just to the side of a little dogwood bush was a light hanging there and the light shining down to where i was at he said rise and go by the way of carters well i looked around it was almost dark by then the bell had been ringing they had sent search parties out me he said i jumped and run through the woods as quick as i could he said jumped over a little strand of wire right into brother wright's arms he said brother billy mama's been ringing the bell for a while we've hunted you everywhere he said i said brother all right no supper tonight georgie carter is going to come out of that bed and live he said how do you know the lord just met me right up there by that dogwood bush and told me to go by the way of carters oh hallelujah he said dear believe god answered on both ends of the line while that is happening the woman begins to pray about go down and get begins to kneel down and pray the mother of this girl and and begins to pray for her daughter and begin to pray you know god this man's in the country and he's stirring up a fuss and causing my daughter to get all out of sorts and i don't know what to do i don't know what to do about it i don't i don't know what to what to say it's just laying there dying and him coming around saying something got her all crying and stood up and while she was praying she said she's seen a shadow across the wall and she thought it was her daughter lived a few doors below coming to see her in the house and when she looked up she said it was a shadow of jesus on the wall and he said who's this and pointed his finger this way like a vision seeing my high forehead coming in packing a bible over my heart she jumped up to run to tell her daughter and about that time i come to the room god moving away the unbelief breaking the stronghold that tried to encamp a brown georgie carter but georgia carter began to believe and began to pray and it seemed to be impossible her daddy her mom went to a church she didn't believe her daddy didn't believe her mama didn't believe but she read something and she had heard the word of god and she said lord i believe and she began to call upon the name of god and the angels of god heard that little girl's prayer and her voice actually went in through the amen all the way into the other realms until brother branham was down there in a whole different place and he heard a cry bye bye a lamb that was tied up in mill town mill town mill and that's what even led him here what can happen for us if we break through the veil of unbelief the stronghold of unbelief as we've been hearing when faith comes into your heart it assembles angels on your behalf and here she is in this terrible condition he walks in said she seen where her she had rubbed the paint of that little poster bed with her little hands back there crying and crying and praying i said before i even knew what i was going to say out in my voice at georgia jesus christ makes you whole stand up on your feet i said i don't even know why i said it myself i wouldn't have said it for nothing because of how this little girl gonna stand up with peg little legs like that not even seem like enough strength to even hold a spit cup you might ask your mother and she'll give you a doctor's statement but you know how how is it going to do i don't know all i can say is there anything too hard for the lord and when that girl heard that she jumped out of that bed with those little sticks of legs she was standing on and i then i turned so feeling through the holy spirit and walked out of the door in a few minutes her mother fainted screaming people began to run everywhere she ran out into the yard and was blessing the grass and the leaves and trees first time she'd seen him in nine years and eight months and people were working on her mother because they thought she had passed away but that's what happened when a little girl began to strike faith pierce through the stronghold of unbelief that was encamped around her and look beyond the voices of unbelief even her own mama her own daddy's saying it ain't possible it's impossible you can't do it there's no way god don't do that no more but she said i believe and it struck the heart of god what did faith and faith brought the answer i was speaking about georgie carter one time up in a meeting with brother joe and the sister came to me afterwards she said you want to see sister georgia she's passed on now but i was a sitter for her in her elder years i said well sure i'd love to see her she turned over a little album she had and there was sister georgie sitting her little house there and i was looking at it and i was looking at this picture and behind i looked in into the picture as it were and on behind her on the wall was a little looked like a little 12 by 12 maybe plaque it looked like some hand-stitched uh uh embroidering i forget what to exactly call it but she had stitched it in there said i believe in the power of a living god i wonder how many tonight can put that over your bed and say i believe in the power of a living god they want to ask where is god dead or who's god i believe in the power of a living god you say well that was 50 60 70 years ago god is not just a god of 50 60 70 years ago he's a god of today i believe in the power of a living god we have witnesses in this hallway this place right here that god done things for just like he did for georgie carter amen they healed their body of impossible diseases and impossible things and the word of god began to speak and said mario your enemy is dead hallelujah i believe our attitude ought to be more than a man more than i don't know our attitude would be yes lord i've seen you do your work i've seen how we have a privilege of seeing what we're seeing oh hallelujah amen they they have that little film they've been putting out the chosen and peter peter made that statement in there he says ain't it amazing that we get to see what we're seeing or something along that lines that's right i thought boy ain't that the truth here we are at the second coming of christ and we have been chosen to see what we're seeing [Music] [Applause] we have been chosen to see amen darkness coming in and they seem like with an impossible force and seem like it's a great force it's going to flood over everything but when the enemy comes in like a flood i'll raise a standard up amen with darkness and unbelief flowing in there's the flag of faith still shining it says he's still a god he's still the same yesterday today and forever i've seen him what i've seen him live i've seen him breathe i've seen god in the flesh hallelujah there's the faith life i the flesh why the faith fly and

their life and they don't have a choice i'll say it again they don't have a choice this word is spoke it's called predestination hallelujah you can stay standing we're almost done well praise the lord

the king that night there is a man in your kingdom that's a dissolver of doubts and the holy ghost tonight is the dissolver of doubt oh now the dissolver of doubts the blood of christ takes away each tang the very stain of doubt there's not a greater sin in the world than unbelief he says for he that believeth not is condemned already amen he that believeth not as condemned there's only one sin
