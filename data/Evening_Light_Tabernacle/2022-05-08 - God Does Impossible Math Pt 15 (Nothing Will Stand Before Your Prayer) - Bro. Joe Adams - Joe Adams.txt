extended to our lives and we've seen lord and we have felt your presence god and we have witnessed today the supernatural lord that there is a living god in laodicea and he's very visible among his people lord and we're so thankful today that we have been called we have been chosen we have been anointed and we have been placed for this opportunity god and i just asked this morning you'd open up the eyes that we can see lord open up our ears this morning that we can hear what this spirit would speak and lord i just pray you'll open these my mouth to speak the things that would edify your body lord and shut my mouth to things out of our man father we just lord just give this day to you today we want to worship you right now father as the word would go forth god may would not only just be in the giving of the word but maybe worship as we receive the word father so we're just praying lord there to be a connection made this morning lord in our faith to be elevated to god for whatever situation we're facing god may you just speak expressly move the immovable this morning lord break the unbreakable father for we know that with god all things are possible so we just commit this day to you now lord in jesus name amen amen well it's good to be here this morning as you're standing i'm just going to want to greet all the mothers and say happy mother's day to you all and just have a quote here that i'd like to read brother brown says you know mother's day should be every day mother should be saying amen right i got brother derek amen in the word it should be every day not to send her a bunch of flowers on mother's day but to love her and to care for her 365 days nights through the year he says your mother if you want to do something for her do it 365 days a year go to her house and offer prayer and and live for god that's that's the thing to do and bring up your children and when your children come up they will call you blessed after you have passed on beyond the veil that's the real spirit of motherhood the real spirit of mother's day mother's day is 365 days a year so we are as the church of the living god we are blessed to have such godly mothers and godly examples in our lives and our churches so we just uh we say happy mother's day to you this morning we have a special birthday i'm not gonna we're not gonna sing happy birthday we quit that a long time ago but joseph has turned 17 today and he has grown up to be a a good-looking godly young man and i thank the lord for him and his testimony in his life so happy birthday son if you have your bibles we're going to look here in hebrews chapter 11 and verse one i want to speak to you this morning on god does impossible math now this is part 15 but i want to my sub topic would be nothing will stand before your prayer and wednesday night by the grace of god i'm going to speak on not even cancer so this is kind of a two-part series but we're going to start here and build it uh it says hebrews 11 and verse 1. now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report notice now through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain notice now by which he obtained witness that he was righteousness his faith gave him the the witness that he was righteous and by faith enoch was translated that he shall not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had a testimony that he pleased god and without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him by faith noah being warned of god of things not not seen as yet moved with fear and prepared an ark to the saving of his house notice faith saved his house by which he condemned the world and became heir of righteousness which is by faith and by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive an inheritance he obeyed he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose builder and maker is god through faith also sarah received strength to conceive and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore spraying there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky and the multitude and as the sandwiches and by the seashore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promise but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth god bless you you can have your seats this morning many times when we read the scriptures i don't know if i say many times maybe it's just me but sometimes we think when we read about the men and the women of the bible we we kind of get it in our minds that they're super human beings right like their time was it was so much easier back in that day than it is this day and somehow we feel like you know today it's much tougher but you know it's not the case they were just as human as you and i are today they had their ups they had their downs you know many of them got sick many of them woke up with backaches many of them had headaches many of them face arthritis many of them face the same things that we face today they had their ups they had their doubts they had their disappointments but we look here in hebrews 11 in the scripture reading here as we recall this is the hall of faith it doesn't mention anything about their mistakes it doesn't mean anything about their failures it doesn't mention anything about their disappointments see they like us had their shared disappointments they had their share of their failures they had their own struggles they had their own hardships but the bible said that each of them died in faith see it doesn't say that they died faithless but they died in faith it doesn't say that their trial was too much for them it doesn't say that they were overcome by their situation it said that they died believing they died trusting they died fully persuaded on the promise so much that they embraced the promise and yet the promise still laid before them and we find they were just only uh exemplifying the believer that's here today in this age and i ask you when we take our last last breath i want you to know god is not going to be looking at your failures and the house of god should have just erupted right then god's not going to be looking at your failures he's not going to be looking at the struggles that you've gone through he's not going to be looking at the times where your humanity got in the way no but when you take your last breath god is going to be looking for one thing did they have faith did they believe me did they take me at my word did they believe what i would do what i said i would do and because that's what god is looking for hillary to see he's looking for somebody that i have faith somebody that'll believe no matter what they're facing some young boy that's going to have faith in the promise of god that yeah i can overcome yeah i can receive the holy ghost yeah healing is my portion somebody's here this morning that's going to believe i know it's mother's day but what better day to give homage to the mother than believing that there's sons and daughters here right now that are believing god and knowing that nothing will stand before your prayer notice hebrews 11 and verse 1 says now faith is faith is not will be or may be but faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen and the word faith here is the assurance can we get an amen on that it's the assurance that's all you need to know is faith is the assurance and the word here says that it is so faith is the assurance and faith is this substance and the word substance means foundation so it's a sure foundation it's the assurance it's the foundation and the word evidence is proof so not only do you have the assurance because it's built on a firm foundation but the believer has proof as well that whatsoever things they desire when they pray if they ask it in the name of jesus then they shall have whatsoever they desire see faith is not something that you work yourself up to a lot of times we feel like we got to get our faith worked up right we come in we want to be cheerleaded a little bit you know the right song special is the right song it's got to be fast you know or it's got to be moving and this that another but faith is something that you have problem says now faith being the substance he says and in there we find out in hebrews what faith was and what those who did it had faith he says there's many times that people have faith today and guess what tomorrow they haven't got it have you ran across anybody like that better yet have you been somebody like that there's many times that people have faith today and tomorrow they haven't got it the next day there's something and then there's something else but want but when god once anchors it and you see it there's nothing ever going to move you from it so when god anchors that into your heart like he did for sister atlanta back there some years ago when it angered in her heart there wasn't a devil in hell there wasn't a cancer that could stand there because something anchored in her heart and she saw look she didn't see the pet scan report but she saw a healer and when she went running around the church what was it god manifested himself to her because faith took a whole faith anchored in the heart of a believer and there was the devil in hell can talk her out of it and it's the same thing for us in our daily walk but obama said now we have five senses see taste meal filling uh smelling here but these five senses are only to contact the human body they're not the sixth sense he says faith is the sixth sense known to some people they want to call it mental telepathy he's but faith is the only direct and positive sense but we're human so all we think about is what we see what we smell what we hear how's it feel how's it taste and a lot of times that's all that we can comprehend because of our humanity but the problem prophet god said faith is the only more direct and more positive than what you're looking at right now it's more direct and more positive than what you're hearing right now faith is the sixth sense faith is more than sight faith is more than feeling you don't feel faith you don't taste faith you don't smell faith you don't see faith faith is a substance it's a foundation of things hoped for and the evidence it's the proof that the believer is holding true to god's word and it's the proof of things not yet seen now as we dig into this romans 12 and verse 3. sometimes we wonder well do i have faith how many have ever asked that question well the bible tells us that we all have faith so for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly accordingly or according as god had dealt to every man a measure of faith so every man woman boy girl child in this audience this morning those on the street each of you this morning you do have faith here you say brother baby says i know there's many of us that don't have faith i don't have faith to make all the promises come true to come to pass but i sure wouldn't stand in the way of somebody that did have that kind of faith as i've often said i wish i had the faith enough faith like enoch to take a little afternoon walk and go up home with him i wish i could have that kind of faith how many would like that kind of faith well you got that kind of faith he says but we believe there's coming a time when there will be an afternoon or a morning walk for some kind and there'll be a many on earth that will be caught away in the rapture at the coming of the lord i believe we're nearing that time now notice he has given every man a measure of faith so within your heart this morning you possess the faith of the rapture whether you feel like it whether you see it whether you hear it or not it doesn't matter the word of god remains true he has dealt to every man a measure of faith so i will rejoice right now no matter what i'm going through no matter my struggles no matter my situation right now i'm a possessor of the rapture right now i'm a possessor of a body change right now i got the faith that i need to overcome the trial that i'm in so he's given every man a measure of faith so there's not one of us sitting here this morning that lacks faith we all have it now some have greater faith than others others have less faith than others or than some but we all have faith now this is going to shock you for a minute but do you believe that even an atheist has faith to be a native this is what you got to believe you got to have more faith to believe as an atheist does than we do as believers because you had to believe that nothing produced everything nothing produced everything that we see that we feel that we have today in our society nothing did all this my my i'll just stay with the word of god it's a lot easier to believe it but to be an atheist you've got to believe that non-life produced life oh my imagine that one non-life produced life that randomness produced precision that chaos produced order i'm sorry i'm just going to stick with the bible so but everybody has to have faith and even the atheist those that deny god have faith in what they believe and you know what they have more faith than you and i see faith is something brother man says faith is something that you have now if i was starving the morning and you can tell by the grace of god i'm not i've not gone hungry but if i was starving this morning and a loaf of bread would save my life and the purchase of the loaf of bread is 25 cents and somebody gave me 25 cents he said i can just he goes i can just be as happy as i got the 25 cents as if i had the loaf of bread because what is the 25 cent the 25 power of the loafer bread so if i was starving i was down to my last meal i knew if i didn't get something i was gonna die and brother aaron gave me 25 cents i just start dancing right then i start making my way down to the store right then it doesn't matter if they didn't open up tomorrow or the next day if i was weak i had in my hand i purchased power and i want you to know today's church you have in your hands the purchase power whatever your need is you've got the 25 cents this morning it's called faith you got the purchase power right now see if you got the 20 some of our our or some of us today we have the loaf of bread sister atlanta had a loaf of bread since mariah had a loaf of bread brother david dexter loaf of bread little dru loaf of bread different ones loaf of bread but some of you many of you got 25 cents many of you got 25 cents this morning 25 cents can't do much to keep you alive it'll keep you alive see as long as you got to purchase power you'll not starve as long as you got the purchase power you'll get well as long as you've got the 25 cents you'll be delivered as long as you've got the 25 cents you will overcome as long as you got the purchase power you can receive the holy ghost as long as you've got the purchase power you will go in a rapture for as long as you got the purchase power and each of you right now in your possession have or has the purchase power see faith with it we can do all things but without faith we can do nothing and with faith there's nothing impossible to them that'll believe and god has dealt every man in this building this morning to purchase power now does god equip you with exactly what you have needed so that you couldn't say well he didn't give me what i needed and you fail no he gave you what you need he knew what it was going to take to overcome laodicea so god by his mercy and his grace placed it in your heart even when you don't feel like you have the faith he's already dealt you a measure of faith and brother brown will say now notice now it's not a myth talking about faith faith is not a myth it's not an imagination it's a substance and anything that's a substance isn't a myth it's something that you actually have got a hold of it's now because there are some people that fail to get this they have hope instead of faith you find some people brother aaron can testify we come and you deal with them in a prayer line and they have hope and they have hope their confession is all wrong well i i hope got to do this or i hope god i i'm begging god please mr god do this for me and that ain't the way you come to god you come by faith not by hope he goes you hope that you will or you're you know you have some kind of imaginary faith because that you feel that you've appropriated that he goes but when actually you got a hold of faith it's a substance it's something that's real then you hold that and that is what brings it you hold that faith now now first part we got everybody here has faith right can i get a show of hands this is going to be i'm teaching this morning brother aaron's smirking so now we all realize we got faith now how do we grow our faith anybody want to know that answer some of you look like you've been sat on a log and had a bad day this morning i'm just going to look past y'all he says now i love this this is in second corinthians 10 and verse 15 not boasting of things without our measure that is of other men's labors but having hope when your faith is increased so your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to the rule of abundancy so we find then that in the scriptures we all have faith but not only do we have faith but our faith can be increased so now i'll go to the gym brother johnny i would have him stand up and take his jacket off and you'd see these big pythons of arms on demands and but you know he didn't get that he just was born with that kind of physique and that kind of muscles he worked at it and i go to the gym i got genetics working against me you know but i go to the gym every day and i'm in there for an hour about every day and you know and i want to get these great big muscles and i want to try to get defined so my wife will love what she's look what she has you know you just hey yes keep doing what you're doing go to the gym spend all that time but we think about when it comes to our faith muslims how do we get great big faith muscles but i'm saying faith has great big muscles and a hairy chest but you don't go there you don't get those great big faith brothers brother aaron by not going to the gym no we go to the gym and you learn what foods to eat that's going to help your muscles grow you learn what exercises to do to help your muscles reach the maximum potential you do all these things you don't do it once you do it day after day after day after day hour after hour after hour and that's the same thing that happens with your faith you want to find great big fake muscles you want your faith to be increased then you got to go to the gym of life call trials and tribulations where god will take you from one test to another test and he'll remain faithful in this test and your faith will increase to the next test on to the next test and when you face these little simple things god will bring into a great big trial and it may be for your healing of your body but yet god remains faithful and he's giving you great big faith muscles [Applause] and your faith is increasing when sister atlanta got healed sister moriah got here what did it do for our church the faith of this church elevated it elephant all of us stepped up our muscles grew we knew right then if god could do that for sister atlanta if god could do that for sister moriah if god could do that for brother david if god could do that for little drew what could god do for us oh god let our faith muscles go this morning notice now we can have faith for the healing of the body we can have faith for the direction of a job we can have faith from deliverance of atonement and spirit and god intends for our muscles our faith muscles to grow but how do they grow see god says in his word he's looking for one thing when the son of man returns he's looking for one thing he's not looking for all your accolades he's not looking for how many souls you won he's not looking for how many trips you took overseas he's not looking for how many how many times you preach the gospel he's not looking for those and he's looking for one thing shall the son of man find faith faith for your own personal struggle faith for your own personal healing will you find will he find faith will he find a young man that'll lay it all down and go and turn his his back from the things of the world and give his heart solely committed to god will he find a young woman he'll give it all up knowing that the devil would love to take her and just use her for a billboard of his own glory but god has got a hold of that heart and she's turned it all down to be a love slave to him he's looking for somebody that'll occupy faith so now he's looking for somebody god is looking for faith he's looking for a man a woman a boy a girl that'll believe god doesn't want your faith to diminish he doesn't want your faith to wither up he doesn't want you to get to a place where you you can hardly ever believe for anything he wants you to believe he wants you to trust him he wants you to obey him he wants you to have confidence in his word and not only that but in the direction that he has for your life i said it once before and i'll say it again god has jurisdiction over your life not the devil god does jurisdiction rulership leadership guidance over every one of our sometimes it looks like our life is in chaos doesn't it like every day you wake up it's like another trouble but i want you to know god is in control god has jurisdiction god knows what he's doing and god because god knew these things would that you would come through he planted inside that little heart of yours faith faith comes by hearing we find here in romans 10 and verse 17 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god notice what you got to feed on so we have been provided in our day over 1200 sermons there's no reason no excuse for you to say i can't be fed i don't have faith or my faith is weak my faith isn't much you got 1200 sermons not only that god ordained in his scripture in the word that he's given some apostles preachers teachers evangelists and missionaries he's given a fifo ministry for what for the edifying of the church for the building up of the body see it's imperative that we are feeding on the right things it's imperative that we are hearing the right things we don't need to be you know for our faith to increase and we got to make sure that we're feeding on the things that would increase our faith and not deplete our faith you find a difficult situation you're in a battle last thing you want to do is go surround yourself with negative people right say you got cancer this morning last thing you want to do is go find a bunch of negative nancies excuse me sister nancy that's just a phrase you know i'm not oh my i better just keep on preaching she'll shut down on me and i'll be digging out of this whole rest of the service but the last thing you want to do is surround yourself with negative people and negativity see negativity breeds doubt and unbelief and you can never rise up and take the promise with a negative confession okay doubt and unbelief well not only what i'm gonna do it'll only hold the promise out here a little bit longer a little bit longer it's like a carrot on end of a stick you know how to get a donkey to move you put a carrot in the stick and you just hang in front of him he's going to go wherever that carrot moves he never gets to taste it and all he gets to do is smell it and a lot of times that's what faith or not faith that's what doubt and unbelief is to the believer he's just hanging out there to get you to go this way and this way and you're doubting this and you're doubting that when god's given you a promise but see if doubt and non-belief will ever take hold of the promise of god there's nothing that the devil can do at that point to keep it from you so you may have faith for somebody else and some of us do it's easy to believe for somebody else right man you could it's easier yeah you're exactly right man you get on the on your knees you begin to go to battle and you begin to go to pray there's not a doubt and a shadow of doubt in the world that that person is going to be delivered or set free or healed or whatever it may be but we find if you're around negativity and you're around negative people and you have this own negative connotation to your own life then what you find is doubt and unbelief will be well god can do it for them but i'm not sure if god will do it for me not that he can do it but that he will do it for me we know that he can because he's already he's already expressed it once or twice or three or four or many times before but will god do it for me see you need to surround yourself with people that will lift you up those that will encourage you those that will be praying for you when you're in a great big battle in a great big trial you don't need job's friends you don't need those oh yeah you you're a secret center buddy you done done this uh-huh you just need to go confession it's good for the soap here's my shoulder go on and confess cry boo-hoo and all that no you need to find somebody like a caleb and a joshua we're well able to take the land i know what you're going through we're well labeled god's already vindicated if he can heal cancer he can take care of your knee if he can heal alopecia he can take care of that situation if he can bring a wayward son back wake him up in the middle of the night and bring him to church in his bazaar let me tell you god can do it for your situation god can do it for your prodigal god's not stopped being god he's just looking for somebody that'll grab hold of the horns of us and believe this morning so notice now your faith is what saves you and i'm going to say something else your faith is what keeps you saved praise the lord now romans 10 and verse 14 and then shall they call upon him who they have not believed and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher so we got to have preaching as much as those that are trying to shut down the ministry we got to have preaching it's ordained of god because what does preaching do it brings the faith of the people up that they can attain to the promise of god and it also directs god's able to take that ministry and direct thoughts and direct things to certain needs and minister to your need in your own personal way and god can speak expressly to you now i'm a proponent of push and play but i do that in my car i do that in my study i do that when i'm at the gym i do that when i'm on the treadmill i push play a lot i'm feeding on the word of god but it's not a substitute for what you get right here anointed preaching coming down like a surgeon with the precision to be able to cut out allow your faith to rise up to cut out situations and circumstances and things from our lives first corinthians 1 verse 18 for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise i will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not god made the foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe otherwise it's through the foolishness of preaching it saves those that has faith in what is being preached so god has ordained a prescribed method and we find that it's your faith in that prescription that saves you how shall they believe unless there be a preacher i'm not saying that we need to put our faith in a man because we don't want to put our faith in any one man but we put our faith in what that man is preaching that it is for me it is a word of god i believe it and so what good is faith you may ask brother joe i made it this far without faith no you didn't but what good is faith with faith you can be healed this morning with faith you can be delivered this morning with faith you can be set free this morning with faith you can overcome this morning with faith you can take a rapture this morning but without faith you're bound for hell or at best a tribulation so your faith is what saves you brother i'm gonna say it like this and it's your personal faith in the finished work at calvary or of christ at calvary that brings both salvation and healings he says now he was a little earlier in this same line of thought here in the message can we see jesus he says now if a man can heal you he can also save you because it's the same atonement so nor is brother branham a divine healer because if he was a divine healer then he would have to be a divine savior and there's only one divine savior which is jesus christ therefore our faith doesn't rest in a man it rests in him who made the sacrifice but our faith rests in the work of redemption our faith rests in the preaching of the gospel our faith lays in that he says now and then your personal faith in that finished work draws the remuneration remuneration from what he did at calvary so it draws from god your your faith draws dividends from god's work it brings the substance it brings the reality to you to your home to your need to your struggle to your situation your faith not somebody else's faith your faith in the promise now we look here in ephesians 2 and verse 8 am i going okay this morning this is teaching now ephesians 2 and verse 8. for by grace are you saved notice through faith so it's your faith that saves you so by grace are you saved through faith and not of your i love how god said you know what god's like i'm taking man completely out of the equation you've got nothing to do with this it's by faith are you saved or by grace or you say through faith not of yourselves it is a gift of god not of works not of the hail mary it's not how many times you attended service didn't attend service showed up for this and walked a little late across the street and packed somebody's groceries home it's not all of that it's not of works lest any man should boast about oh look what i've done for the kingdom and i'm afraid to say there's a lot of men going around bragging about what they've done for the kingdom well i did this and i did this and i did this and he's going to say depart from me i never knew you because it ain't based on what you did for the kingdom it's based on what he did for you to get you to the kingdom so it is now for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we shall walk in them so i want to capitalize here in ephesians 2 and verse 8 for by grace are we saved and it's through faith and notice it's a gift of god you didn't have to work at it you didn't have to buy it you didn't have to purchase it it was god's love gift to you god gifted you faith to believe now notice it's what you do with that faith that's going to bring the blessing or not because you can be an atheist because he's got the same amount of faith if not more than some of us to believe in what he believes so it's based on how you direct the faith that god has given you do you believe his word do you believe his prophets do you believe the preaching do you believe the ministry do you believe what god's word says about you or are you is your belief based in what the world says and the negativity that surrounds the world and satan's on eden and now he's scripted and built up this great big thing today but we find with faith nothing shall be impossible to you with faith nothing shall be impossible to you no situation is impossible as long as you have the purchase power there's no sickness there's the loved one there's no complex that you will have that will supersede the faith and cause you not to attain the promise of god because with faith all things are possible to him that'll believe now brother braum says in at thy word lord he says now only by your confession can you be saved see that's the most powerful weapon that god put in the hand of a man is committal and a confession it'll do it every time somebody say every time so committal and confession it'll do it every time if you believe it accept it on those bases and believe it and stay with it keep confessing it when you confess he says you know a lot of people they look at the symptoms they always go around and they well i wish i could feel better and you know he goes that doesn't have one thing to do with it it's what you believe not what you feel now how many of you feel saved this morning a couple of your cherubs some of you how many you don't feel saved this morning if you ought to be more hands i woke up i didn't feel safe i went home yesterday i didn't feel safe i didn't do this and i didn't do that and a lot of times the devil just begins to to be let us be he says but it's not what you believe it's not on how you feel he says now he goes if all of you here tonight he said that that are saved and you got in your head that you're not saved and you'll go around saying well i'm not saved anymore he goes you're not saved now how simple is that you go around right now your confession is you walk out of this church bless god i can't stand brother joe's preaching i'm not saved i don't feel like i got the holy ghost he said you're not saved but if it can work that way what about the positive way what about you come out to oh bless god what a service we had i'm saved i'm filled with the holy ghost i'm healed i can believe for the promise of god ain't no devil can stand before me i know who i am and i know whose i am that's all that i care about this morning i got faith this morning i believe the words of god this morning he says there's not a christian in here no matter how solid you are in faith if right now that you something happened to get a hold of you and tell you that you're not a christian and you start out testifying well i'm not a christian no more he goes you drop right then look how immediate the effect of negativity is right then your testimony your confession drops and you're not safe he goes you're no more christian anymore as soon as you testify that you're not a christian then you drop from grace right there you're falling because why your own your own speech tells what you are your own speech tells what you are now i know there's some of us there's times we don't feel like we're saved there's times we didn't we don't feel like we're christians the devil gets in your ear and begin to whisper well you're not good enough and you did this you did that but as long as your confession is i'm saved i'm healed i'm filled with the golden holy ghost satan is defeated then satan is defeated but it's all but if you go around the comments well i'm not saying you know i tried to serve god and i went to that church and you know there's a bunch of do's and don'ts and regulations and you know they try to legislate holiness and well you know what i just it wasn't for me well it's not gonna be for you if that's your confession it's not for me well it's not for you if your confession is that you're not healed and you know i guess it ain't in god's will come on you're we're not baptist i got a great friend of mine he's a baptist pastor and he and i had a conversation about sister atlanta turkey hunting one morning about six o'clock in the morning sitting up in a little sagebrush we're sitting there talking and i was telling them about how god came down and healed sister atlanta and and delivered her cancer he goes you really believe god healed her i said absolutely god healed her he goes well how did you know i said it's in the word god's purpose and god's plan is he's the lord thy god that healeth thee it is god's will to heal well you know the baptist met the method is well if it is god's will then he will do it well you can believe that if you want to we're not baptists here this morning we're believers i'm believing for healing i'm believing for deliverance i'm believing for a rapture i'm believing for a body change i'm believing for the supernatural so if you confess this morning that the holy ghost is not for you you will never receive the holy ghost doesn't matter notice now it doesn't always have to be with your lips either it could be with your actions your actions come in with the wowzy wowzy woos head all beat down preaching's going forth you'd rather sleep than get anything from god your actions are telling you i'm not interested i'm not convinced therefore i'm not concerned you expect to get something from the service like that but if you come dragging in and you got a need and no matter what you're fighting you fight that sleepy spirit until god gets a hold of your heart because faith is resonating you want something from god you come with an expectation god will meet that expectation every time you come you beat that body into subjects and say you're gonna go to church oh boy you're gonna listen up this ain't no time to sleep all we got to do is one more hour and we'll be out of here you can make it one more hour sometimes you just got to talk dirty to yourself or mean to yourself not dirty but you got you got to be aggressive come on i know you're tired you was up to one o'clock last night and he was up again at 6 30 trying to study but i'm here oh what did you do you showed the devil what side of the fence you're on let me tell you that i may be tired this morning i may be weird this morning i may be fighting a great fight but i know i'm on the lord's side i'm here i'm giving testimony i'm letting my faith reign out i'm a son of god i'm a believer this morning and ain't no devil ain't no devil hell can't keep me from the promises glory to god this morning can't no devil keep you from the brother nothing will stand before your prayer nothing no sickness no situation no trial no devil nothing will stand before your prayer glory to god this morning oh hallelujah my brother brown says in the message except god's gift 1953. he says now healing is not something that you just say well i believe it i believe it he said no that's all right if that's the best you can do just mentally say it well i see i believe it i'll accept it he goes then if you accept and notice he says if you accept it on those bases he says say it over and over and over and over and over until you finally believe it did you hear that say it over i'm healed but you got your knees are killing you i'm healed but my leaves i'm healed by my back i'm healed say it over and over and over until you finally believe it and then when you believe it that's faith because it anchors he said don't let or don't have a negative testimony every time when you confess well i still feel bad today i guess i'll go straight back he goes you go straight back in that same rut that she was in the beginning that's not he goes there's not a man or woman in here that's been baptized with the holy ghost but you would start your confession i believe i lost the holy ghost i believe it's gone from it he goes you'll go right down you'll never he says you'll go right down right then right now that's why we got to have a positive confession you'll find people come in a prayer line or come up for prayer you hear him say i want the assurance who doesn't want the assurance but faith that he planted inside of you is what assurance that's what faith means he's given you the assurance well brother i just need the assurance well then say it over hand over hand over you want the assurance of the holy ghost the only ghost is mine the holy ghost is mine the holy ghost is mine the holy ghost is mine it's for whosoever will the holy ghost is mine it's for you for your loved ones for those as many as the lord our god shall come the holy ghost is mine you keep saying it and over and over you don't need some man to lay hands on you and tell you you got it all you got to do is believe the word it's assurance say it over and over say it over and over until you believe it until you believe it not believe that brother aaron lay it hands on you and therefore you got it you believe it it's personal to you you met god's requirements and because you met his requirements he sealed you or he's healed you or he's delivered you because you met the requirement and look wake up every day i'm healed i'm healed it may be the worst day y'all need how many of you all been watching brother ron if you hadn't you need to this man's going to the pulpit just throwing up his guts and feeling miserable sugar spiking and dropping and he's all over the place but when he stands behind that pulpit i'm going to say that's another man god using him like never before because while he ain't just confessing over and over he has been an example to multitudes out there this is how you fight the good fight of faith this is how you believe you don't believe one minute the only digress today you keep standing you keep firm on the promise of god god is my healer god is my deliverer i'm standing here as a testimony to you that god's gonna deliver god has delivered me of this cancer notice now hebrews 3 and verse 1. wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus that word profession means acknowledge our confession and then accept god's gift he says you'll never live above your confession some of y'all need to start confessing the right things write it on your refrigerator stick it in the mirror when you brush your teeth you got to start confessing the right things just smoking around in the wowzy wowzy woos always defeated nobody cares nobody loves you get that hog wash out of your mentality your sons and daughters of god anointed elected called chosen place for this hour god didn't just give this to anybody god placed it in your hands this glorious message that we have today it's not just for anybody the probably gotta say for a special class of people look at the special class of people here this morning come on church let me tell you i didn't make you what you are brother tim didn't make you what you are brother timothy brother ron brother aaron no preacher made you what you are but god before the foundation of the world he saw fit to put your name on that special section of the book of life it's called the lamb's book of life and ain't no devil ain't no sickness ain't no torment spirit ain't no pornography take nothing a racial name off of it let me tell you can't nothing stand before the believer's prayer not cancer not sugar not disdain or that disease we're more than overcomers notice now he says you'll never live above your confession see jesus is the high priest of our confession now some of us you know it's like a tree starts growing if it ain't planted right it starts leaning now some of us we lean by genetics and i'm just preaching off the cuff we lean by family strains and we we're growing we're growing we're becoming a mature tree where we're going crooked we're leaning a little bit toward the negative side so we're facing the positive but we're leaning here just think if we could straighten ourselves up just that little bit of movement toward the promise of god that little movement to believe that no matter what you ask for you can have it so we sign he says here jesus is the high priest of our confession am i still on i didn't think i was where's the hand he says you'll never live above your confession jesus is the high priest of our confession he says now any scholar knows that the same word profession is confession see it's just translated now sitting at the right hand of the father he's there ready to make intercessions upon what upon what you confess see jesus is there at the right hand he says he can't do nothing for you until you first confess that he's done it you want something from god then let the negativity leave your vocabulary let it leave your mouth let it leave your actions let me just say i'm preaching from i'm just preaching this is real you want something from god get out of the little wowzy wowzy woods and start believing on the promise start confessing what the word says about you he says now there was a man trying to seek god every every time he say now i'm saved the devil said nope no you're not how many has ever said had that happen okay this is remember this is teaching service class participation there's a man trying to seek god and every time he say i'm saved the devil would say no you're not but one day he drove down a stake he said satan from this zone he says i'll point to this state this is the place where i met god's requirement right here he says you drive a stake down right beside your seat this afternoon saying satan right here is where every doubt's going to lay i'm going to fly away with him this afternoon i'm going to accept exactly what he told me that i could be and i'll believe it right now but many times then he wants to come in and sometimes he'll disguise himself as an angel of the light or he'll disguise himself as a roaring lion but you've got to stand fast on the word of god and believe what the word says about you that will do everything he can to rob your soul of eternal life that's his business but your business is just drive a stake down this morning drive it down this morning and tie yourself through faith this morning say i'm going to be moved i'm not backing off this problem it's my promise this morning it's my word this morning it's my portion this morning say you can't have it i'm driving a steak down this morning he says it's your business your business is to have faith in your heart and stand by as long as all heaven holds when god saves you drive down a stake to that spot when god filled you with the holy ghost you drive a stake down to that spot god he's here he's healed you he's filled you you drive your state down i mean somebody some believer this morning needs to be driving a stake oh i just wish i could hear hear the hammer being been pounded against that stake oh satan says you're not gonna amount to none satan says you might as well give up satan says you can't do it it's not for you drive the stake down this morning let the devil howl let him raise let him do what he wants to we're going to stand on the word of god i'm saved i'm healed i'm filled i got the holy ghost when the enemy comes in like a flood we got a promise god's going to raise a standard what is he raising it with he's raising it with the believer's faith to take god at his word notice now i believe brother aaron's going to preach on this when he when he comes in a couple weeks so i just kind of had to steal it last night because or this morning because you know with preachers we plagiarize each other all the time but i started looking at and he kind of gave me a little bit of thought so i'm like i'm gonna have to run with it real quick i get the first service so here we go but this drive down a stake into the ground that's a native american term you didn't know that did you he just sounded real religious didn't it sound good it was a religious term we'll take it but see it's a it's a native american term when they were under attack it looked like they were going to be defeated they would drive a stake in the ground and actually tie a person by the leg to him so that they had to stay there and defend that piece of ground even if it meant death oh what we need to do today is take a stand no matter what it looks like no matter how we feel no matter what the people say no matter what we need to drive a stake in the ground this morning and say no matter what i'm going to defend this position i'm going to defend the holy ghost i'm going to defend the virtues of this man i'm going to stand here i'll tie my soul with the heaven of faith and i'm going to believe that this is my this morning i'm going to fight this devil and that devil i believe in that cancer is defeated i believe that sugar diabetes is defeated i tied myself i drove down my state i believe the word this morning oh devil you got to fight on your hands this morning because we're driving down stakes drive down that state this morning and tie your soul to it by faith oh faith it's not time to quit it's not time to give up it's not time to give in i know you're facing hardships just ain't time to quit drive a stake tie yourself to it draw your sword and be ready to fight even if it means death oh even so this is not whatever will be will be that's how sometimes we want to think but this is a time to drive that stake down and occupy until jesus comes see keep keep taking ground keep advancing don't back up brother made a good point so when they drove a stake down they came back if they made advancements they came back to that state they knew this is the furthest point i can't go beyond this let me tell you church you may get backed up to that state but we ain't going back behind it so whatever it is you driving down this morning you drive down with the with the mindset that i'm moving forward but if i get defeated and i get backed up i'm not going past my stake i've drove it in the ground all i can say from this time forward it's over christian soldier marching on to war i'm not backing up i'm not gonna bend i'm not gonna break i'm moving forward i'm changing the line we're advancing to the army of the living god this morning we can't be moved church oh we're held in the inexhaustible fountain of life he's holding me in his hands this morning let's press the battle like we've never pressed before drive your stake down keep confessing that you're healed keep confessing that your bride try that sake now just think for a minute how advanced would we as a bride of christ be if we gave as much attention to the promises of god as we do to the lives of the enemy where would we be if we would give much attention to the promises of god as we do to the lies as we do to how we feel i don't feel good well with this not you want something on feelings i got you a quote right here i'm glad you asked he says now you're not saved because you feel like you're saved and the house of god said amen oh i know he says i know i'm saved because i had a chill run through me and so forth he goes that's not why you're safe satan can whoop you or whip you around the stomach everywhere and he can too upon your feelings that's right but when you walk back and say thus saith the lord my faith is built on the word of god he can't whip that away notice he can whip you around the stump on your feelings he can whip you around the stump on your imaginations he can whip you around the stuff on all these ideas memory conscious affection reasoning he can whip you around and stuff on that but he can't whip you around the stuff oh thus saith the lord and i'm gonna tell you thus saith the lord this morning you are the sons and daughters of god and ain't no devil can back you from that theories may change but it doesn't change god god's the unchangeable god his word is eternally true and your faith is to rest solely on the word of god not what man says about it but what god says about it and how does god bring it to pass god brings it to pass by interpreting through manifestation that's how you know it's thus saith the lord not because i'll tell you but if the holy spirit comes behind it and amends it and bring the manifestation he says now i'm saved because the word of god tells me i'm saved satan can whoop you around anywhere on how you feel he goes but i believe it because god said so and i accept it upon the basis of his word that's how i was saved i believed it i confessed it and then it works the results i believed it then i confessed it and then it works the results are then it manifests what is being preached or what is being believed he said but the first thing i'm saying because god's word teaches that i'm saved that's how you're saved if you're saved satan can whip you on your ideas and things but he can't go around the word of god jesus said it is written and that settled it with all it is written in the scriptures some of you need to remind the devil what the word says about you he's always trying to put thoughts in your head put these lies in your head we'll spin these things in your ear you're not going to make it you're going to die you're going to die of an early age you're going to do this that and the other you know you're never going to get the holy ghost it ain't for you this message ain't for you that's all lies it's all lies see i'm not saved today because i can shout and some of you saying praise god because i don't shout if it was heading on some of you or most of all of us would be saved this morning yeah oh my is right he said when i say because we can shout i'm not saying i'm saved not because i i feel like i'm saved i'm saved because i've met god's conditions of the bible he that heareth my words and believeth or otherwise has faith on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life i believe that that's right and on them conditions i'm saved because god said so now let me just say this there's not one faith that saves you and another faith that heals you there's not one faith that heals you and another faith that delivers you there's not one faith that delivers you there is another faith for miracles there's no degrees of faith well it's all one faith one lord one baptism one your faith is anchored in the work that was done at calvary and because of that work it is finished everything you had need of in this journey is already finished now how do we apply faith brother joe as we start bringing this down to a close i didn't say i was closing i'm just kind of descending like an airplane you know you start you start slowing down we're going to slow down a minute we don't want to hit the runway at 100 miles an hour don't want to crash so how do we apply faith you know in the old testament they're at the passover moses was given a commandment or given a commission or given some words and he had to tell the people i want you to go out there and get you some hyssop now hyster wants some educated flower that only the botanist know about they've done all the study and they knew every intricate detail of the hyssop no you know hyster was trampled on every day it was walked by every day you just looked up that's just histo i wish you to quit growing in my front yard i'm sick of this mess i had to mo mo mo it's kind of like bahia in louisiana but he said go get some hyssop and dip it in the blood and apply it apply it to the lentils apply to the door close and brother baby says he goes but for miracles and for healing he goes is it some different type of faith he says no it's the same faith there's only one faith in all things all things are that they're the original but how do we do it he says hyssop was always used to sprinkle the blood and faith is always used today to apply the word faith is always used to apply the word in the days of the passover moses commanded him to take up hyssop and dip it in the blood and splash it upon the doorposts and on the lentils and on the plying of the blood see his was just some common weed not that he says these great big waters of separation represents common faith the believer coming must not be some supernatural now get this this is amen for everybody not some supernatural some kind of fellow with a high education until he knows more than what webster does he doesn't have to be some great theologian he just has to use common faith hyssop pick it up anywhere i don't know why y'all should've been amen i'm not looking at a bunch of theologians out here this morning we're just common people with common faith simple oh louisiana faith to believe he says now hyssop is just a common weed i never want to be more common than i am today because god is using the common things of this world to do the supernatural with he took a common weed and he did a supernatural display when that death angel came over and he swept down and you heard the screams going up and this going up and this one down and that one down is because somebody had enough faith in something that was so common and took god at his word and applied it to their life i'm telling you god is looking for some man and woman today that would take that common old faith how'd you get here this morning nobody rode a horse no you got in the car this morning didn't you some of you got in the car and you turned the key on you didn't think about it it was just common this is just what we do and brother bob said it's that same faith that you apply to the word of god for your circumstance for your situation you don't think about it it's just common everyday faith you don't have to have some super duper faith to believe the word to get the word to work on your behalf you just got to believe just like you did this morning when you get out there and you put the key in the commission or the ignition or you just push the little button and the thing fired up and you stuck it in reverse and you backed out and you're sitting here this morning it's the same kind of faith to move god to your situation you just got to believe lord i know when i walk out i've done major preparations i don't got my church clothes on i got my dancing shoes on i'm ready to go to the house of god i'm going out in the car i'm gonna put the keys in the ignition and glad i'm not even gonna think about it i know it's gonna start and i'm gonna drive down to church and we're going to have a good service on sunday morning and that's what it takes church you want something from god just get yourself dressed right come with the right expectation and be prepared to watch god move be prepared to see a miracle be prepared to see god back off of his word be prepared this morning you want to see god god is here god is moving god is witnessing god has testified that he is a living god he says you don't have to have some super-duper faith some super duper something it just takes common faith in god just believe it like you would if your mother would would have said just get something for you your mother said she was going to get something for you you know how it is a little kid tell you going to disney world man you're going to hold on to disney world till you're 30 years old mama's taking me we going to disney world man 30 years old it's about time to give up no mama said it he said that's the kind of faith you've got to have toward god mama said it probably said may every sick person in divine presence this morning may you reach over just now and jerk a handful jerk you a handful of hyssop out of their own life and apply it to your life that's what you need to do you've been jerking on doubts you've been jerking on unbelief so long you don't know how to apply i'm here to tell you grab a handful of that common faith this morning allow the word of god to elevate your faith reach over and just grab it i'm applying this to my family i'm applying this to my marriage i'm applying this to my home i'm applying this to my children i'm applying it to my body i'm applying it to my job i'm applying it to my church oh bless god i'm gonna apply to this one i'm jerking a handful this morning it may be mother's day but what greater day than to grab a handful of faith and say yes we're gonna have godly minds because why this message produces godly women and godly men those that are believed us saith the lord now god will heal you on the merits of your faith and that alone that's how he heals he says don't forget this now faith is designed to see what god's will and wants there is no knowledge that can do that faith alone is designed to give the human race to find out what god's will is now he said this is where many people fail to get their healing what they're asking for because they take faith as something that it's not he says now see it's just as real as your sense of your body will declare anything it's just as real as my eye says that this is a piece of paper right here it's just as real it's just as real as you say that that is a lie it's just as real as you say i feel my coat it's just as real as you hear a baby talking in the back making noise see it's just as real as i taste something in my mouth it's that real only you can't show it to anybody you have it alone it's yours faith is the substance of things hoped for see it's not a myth it's something that you possess not an imagination it's a substance not an imagination not an emotion but something that you have it comes to you by hearing the word of god faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word and that puts it back to where your faith in is not in some individual it's not in a man it's not in an organization it's not in the group of people it's in god because god is the word and your faith is in god he says no you find people they do something and you say well i can do that too he said you find out they get wrecked up because they do it based on imagination well if god did that film got to do that for me no it's got to be a revelation it's got to be faith and we find the bible would tell us that jesus when he was here he had perfect faith perfect faith in what the word declared about him and what he was in the groom we are in the bright form so shouldn't we also exemplify perfect faith in what he had made us what his word has made us i didn't make you you didn't make you you didn't make me what we are today he made us what we are he says by his faith in his word he conquers he conquers anything both death hell the grave we know that god is god that perfect faith is god's perfect word he conquered everything that he come in contact with death could not even stand in his presence sickness could not stand in his presence flowing from him was like rivers of virtue going out constantly virtue going forth in his from his garment he said this he goes there he was walking walking in a world with perfect faith because he was the word and he says now if you abide in me through him he brought the word to you and my word abide in you then walk in the same kind of way virtues flowing from you the rivers of god the fountains blessings just flowing out of the people see what i mean and you're not bluffing it you're not imagining it you actually are taking place and you see it if you're just to imagine he says don't do any good but if it's really there it's really happened so we realize that perfect faith masters all circumstances and perfect faith in a perfect word and a perfect god there ain't a devil can stand before his people now the bible tells us we start start our descend hebrews 11 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him he that cometh he that worships god must believe in an infinite eternal unoriginated a self-existent the cause of all things of whom everything depends and who by whose energy and bounty and providence all other things exist live and are supplied with the means he needs the continuous of in the existence of life we must believe that he is the all and all we can't substitute him for man we can't substitute him for our favorite preacher we can't shut this to him for our favorite doctrine we got to believe that god is and that god is a rewarder of those that diligently seek god and that's why we're here this morning and he would also tell us in the bible he says now the prayer of faith shall save the sick the prayer of faith this is in james 5 and verse 15 and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another pray for one another that ye may be healed for the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much that word effectual there means put into operation it means active it means mighty otherwise we can say it like this this is not some dead prayer this is not somebody just going through the motions this is a man or a woman who really believes and there put their prayer in operation and it's active and it's mighty and they're expecting to see supernatural results so that word available there means to power as shown by extraordinary deeds to have strength to overcome so the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much it means it does extraordinary deeds prayer by faith does extraordinary deeds prayer of a little sister 15 minutes later saw her prayer manifest when her brother comes staggering in on a wednesday night and he hasn't been the same since prayer an effectual fervent prayer i want my brother saved availed much and that word means to prevail in power to do extraordinary deeds power to see miracles power to see supernatural healing power to believe for lost levels power to overcome and not be overcome daniel 11 verse daniel 11 yes verse 32 and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt with flatteries but the people that know their god shall be strong and do exploits the people that know their god now this word know here as i looked this up how about how to run away i know you think well my goodness brother joe it's only four letters and it's real simple i mean no we know what no means right but the word no here means to have knowledge it's to know is to be acquainted with and it also means to be made known so the people that know their god the people that acknowledge and are acquainted with their god but not only that the people that are known by their god those people those kind of people those are the ones that's going to do exploits those that know their god so it's one thing to know god it's another thing to be known of god because when you know who you are and you know who you are you know where you're standing then you know no matter what prayer you pray ain't a devil in hell can back you up because why you know your god and not only that god knows you and god hears you and god is ready to move on your behalf i say satan you better back up old boy cause i'm talking to believers this morning i'm looking at sons and daughters of god that know their god and are known by their god and we're here today to stand and drive a stake down we're believers and we're believing this morning we're not backing up off the word we're going forward church i'm here to tell you there ain't enough devils in hell can back that believer up this morning you know heart trouble can't stop you diabetes can't stop you cancer can't stop you fail relationships and

things have i written under you that believe on the name of the son of god that you may know that you have eternal life and that you may believe on the name of the son of god and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hears us so whatsoever we ask and we know that we have our petitions that we desired of him so whatsoever things a lot of times we want to bring our small problems we want to bring the little things to god as if god can't do the big things i mean if he's god can't he do it all yeah i'll tell you if he's god i'll bring bringing loved ones i'll be bringing situations i'll be bringing hurts i'll be bringing pains i'll be bringing complex i'll bring it all to him because he's god

wants us to ask and believe that our joys may be full this is what god wants of you he wants us to ask and to believe that our joys may be full he wants you to ask abundantly you know you may call somebody too much annoy them fool out of them y'all laugh because y'all probably do it you know you touch them all the time or it's like you can't do nothing without posting on facebook or something
