[27:48] amen we have the walls family here this
[27:50] morning we want to welcome and glad to
[27:52] have you here with us he was uh i
[27:55] believe with us in israel uh when we
[27:57] were in israel a couple of years ago
[28:00] what was it a few years back
[28:02] and
[28:03] you know we had a wonderful time
[28:05] together we got to do something very
[28:07] special during that time
[28:10] because the
[28:11] mount sinai was closed off and
[28:14] we didn't get to go there so they kind
[28:16] of did a little surprise
[28:18] uh for us and they took us to a place
[28:21] called shiloh
[28:23] and that is where that
[28:25] um
[28:26] you know where hannah went and prayed at
[28:28] shiloh and
[28:29] and god promised her a son
[28:32] and that was samuel and she gave him
[28:34] unto the lord god gave her a prophet
[28:38] and it was just a very moving time for
[28:40] us because we had a lot of things that
[28:42] was on our hearts
[28:44] as i looked across the rising of the sun
[28:47] and
[28:48] and saw the great um coming across the
[28:51] sea of galilee just a few days before
[28:53] that before we went to shiloh and and
[28:56] thought about it you know at the rising
[28:57] of the sun and going down at the west
[28:59] his name is to be praised and he goes on
[29:02] you know how that he will what he will
[29:04] do for his people and he'll make um the
[29:08] the barren woman to rejoice and to be a
[29:10] mother of children and things like that
[29:13] was just laid there right there in that
[29:15] promise it just made it so
[29:18] so
[29:19] alive in us as i i looked over there i
[29:21] couldn't help but think that same son
[29:24] was was had risen there
[29:27] many times during jesus life and
[29:29] ministry in that same sea of galilee
[29:32] right there it would raise over over
[29:34] that same sea and i was looking upon the
[29:37] scenes at um where jesus walked and the
[29:40] apostles walked and the prophets walked
[29:42] and
[29:43] and you know bible bible days and the
[29:46] bible times and went down to shiloh and
[29:49] and um as we began to reflect on
[29:52] where we were as i said it first took us
[29:55] by surprise because we didn't know we
[29:57] were gonna go there and it was just kind
[29:59] of thrown in at the last minute
[30:02] and um you know we had some the ones on
[30:05] our hearts my daughter bethany wanted a
[30:08] baby another child and she had suffered
[30:11] four miscarriages
[30:13] and um you know so she was on her heart
[30:17] there was a candace
[30:19] tushner who
[30:20] had not had a child and you know been
[30:22] married how many years
[30:24] nine years
[30:26] and and now of course this was several
[30:28] years ago so probably about seven
[30:31] six or seven years and they have not had
[30:33] children and
[30:35] and
[30:36] you know then of course my daughter
[30:37] esther
[30:38] um who uh we were also
[30:41] and still believe in the lord to give
[30:43] her a child
[30:44] amen and and of course while i was while
[30:47] i was moved on i just began to pray for
[30:50] these uh different needs and i walked
[30:52] out of
[30:52] uh out of the
[30:54] the little theater there that they had
[30:56] kind of showing the story of shiloh and
[30:59] whatever and it opened up into the ruins
[31:02] there and we walked down among the ruins
[31:03] and
[31:04] walked back up and and
[31:06] they asked me to pray
[31:08] and there i prayed for the barren women
[31:12] and i called by name these different
[31:14] ones that had a need there and a desire
[31:18] that was on their lives and then i went
[31:21] from there and began to pray for barren
[31:23] souls
[31:24] where that those that didn't know the
[31:27] lord and had never experienced him and
[31:30] and or maybe we're prodicals away from
[31:32] god for there to be a birth that would
[31:34] take place in them
[31:36] and then i prayed again and and prayed
[31:39] for the barren church that we've been
[31:41] looking for jesus to come back
[31:43] and and you know for that church to
[31:46] bring forth life
[31:48] in this day and hour and see you know it
[31:49] was a very moving time in fact the guide
[31:53] he was a jewish man he would wipe his
[31:55] eyes and said wow my didn't expect so
[31:58] much emotion at this place but it was
[32:00] more than just emotion it was the
[32:02] the presence of the lord and god has
[32:05] answered prayer and given us a a
[32:08] wonderful
[32:10] uh day today where we can have this time
[32:12] of of rejoicing amen because um we are
[32:16] here to dedicate little abigail

[32:22] blessed the testner family with you know

[1:11:30] and you know
[1:11:32] immediately after i seen him and
[1:11:35] and how spry and bright he was i aspired
[1:11:38] to be like him
[1:11:41] and so you know
[1:11:44] right after seeing him there and we had
[1:11:46] a time of talking together and
[1:11:48] and um
[1:11:50] and he went home and his wife
[1:11:53] of 70 years just suddenly passed away
[1:11:56] and they buried her last sunday
[1:11:59] and then you know brother timothy and i
[1:12:01] went through the mountains over bamf and
[1:12:03] jasper into the rockies and had a
[1:12:05] wonderful week together and we drove
[1:12:07] into beretta's columbia
[1:12:09] where brother biskell and his church
[1:12:10] were celebrating a great milestone of 50
[1:12:13] years from the bibleway house to the log
[1:12:16] church to their present location
[1:12:20] and
[1:12:21] i believe it's been 169
[1:12:24] times over the last 50 years
[1:12:27] that brother biscuit has went overseas
[1:12:30] taken the message
[1:12:31] he hazard his life behind the iron
[1:12:34] curtain risk risk his own safety and and
[1:12:38] um
[1:12:39] and skirted prison terms and getting
[1:12:41] arrested in china
[1:12:43] preaching conventions um everywhere
[1:12:46] literally around the world
[1:12:48] and and with a great burden to take the
[1:12:51] message some of you will remember him
[1:12:53] many years ago back in the
[1:12:56] uh late 60s and and early 70s uh on wwl
[1:13:01] of the um of the
[1:13:03] bible believers broadcast and him
[1:13:06] playing a clip of brother branham on
[1:13:08] there and and uh ending it you know
[1:13:11] yesterday today and forever jesus is the
[1:13:13] same
[1:13:14] and uh you know it's just
[1:13:16] um uh he's done a a great great work
[1:13:21] and um the lord has used him in a mighty
[1:13:24] mighty way and i was privileged to go
[1:13:26] and minister to them
[1:13:28] during this special time and to be a
[1:13:29] part of this
[1:13:31] celebration
[1:13:32] and uh brother biskell and i spent some
[1:13:35] private very private times together and
[1:13:37] shared some special moments
[1:13:39] he's now 87 will be 88 this year
[1:13:44] in october he's been a gallant soldier
[1:13:46] of the cross a great general in the
[1:13:49] service of the lord
[1:13:51] and uh i i just wanted to just show you
[1:13:53] just a couple of little pictures real
[1:13:55] quick
[1:13:56] of uh some of the
[1:13:57] some of the scenes there the ministry
[1:14:00] that was there
[1:14:01] we had brother david mayer um that is
[1:14:04] standing there by brother biscuit he's
[1:14:06] from france and switzerland and hosts
[1:14:08] the meetings in switzerland that i have
[1:14:10] went to and different others that went
[1:14:12] brother timothy has ministered there as
[1:14:14] well not in the conventions but in
[1:14:17] france and where he pastors a church
[1:14:20] and brother
[1:14:21] david would open the first service
[1:14:23] and then of course um
[1:14:25] there would be brother ron spencer was
[1:14:27] there he would preach saturday night and
[1:14:29] we would have a prayer line
[1:14:31] and then there would be brother timothy
[1:14:34] who would minister also i tell you did a
[1:14:37] tremendous job
[1:14:38] it was such a such a tremendous message
[1:14:42] as i listened to him i said well
[1:14:44] you know he's not leaving us nothing to
[1:14:46] preach he's going to climb access
[1:14:48] meeting
[1:14:49] and it was a real blessing how many how
[1:14:51] many has heard all of those services let
[1:14:54] me just see your hands well a good
[1:14:56] number of you or a few of you have and
[1:14:58] and so you know um so we uh we also uh
[1:15:03] you see there of course brother biscuit
[1:15:05] standing between brother ron brother uh
[1:15:07] david mayer and over to the the far
[1:15:10] right his brother tom ray his son
[1:15:12] michael ray and
[1:15:14] and uh my we saw such a great growth in
[1:15:18] the ministry of brother
[1:15:20] michael ray and and moving forward and
[1:15:23] just saw a wonderful atmosphere of the
[1:15:25] holy ghost that was just poured out it
[1:15:28] was just a tremendous time
[1:15:31] um some would say it was the best
[1:15:32] services they'd ever been in their life
[1:15:35] and that's saying a lot we've been in a
[1:15:36] lot but of course it's the freshest on
[1:15:38] our mind as well so you know but anyway
[1:15:41] it was a tremendous time that we had
[1:15:43] together
[1:15:44] and you know i think about the service
[1:15:47] our brother biscuit has made and
[1:15:49] and uh
[1:15:50] he's now not been able to minister in
[1:15:53] the last couple of years and uh
[1:15:56] you know he had open heart surgery and
[1:15:58] and um uh
[1:16:00] he had coveted and different setbacks
[1:16:02] and things like that
[1:16:04] but i thought you know a man who has
[1:16:06] hazarded his life for the gospel of
[1:16:08] christ and been a great general a leader
[1:16:11] and i thought about brother hildebrand
[1:16:14] and him passing on brother meno sitting
[1:16:17] down brother um brother ivan carr and
[1:16:20] and whatever i thought you know
[1:16:23] here we are perhaps at the changing of
[1:16:25] the guard
[1:16:27] you know we're at a junction time
[1:16:30] and yet you know we must go forward we
[1:16:32] must carry this message forward it ought
[1:16:35] to be to the zeal of every heart to burn
[1:16:38] in our hearts
[1:16:40] you know and i know what it is to spend
[1:16:42] weeks away from home i hadn't went away
[1:16:44] 169 different trips like brother biscuit
[1:16:48] and let me just say about that while i'm
[1:16:49] there he didn't go there to build a
[1:16:51] kingdom
[1:16:53] he didn't go there to pass out his tapes
[1:16:56] he didn't go there to to promote his
[1:16:59] ministry he gave them the the voice of
[1:17:02] the seventh angel
[1:17:04] and and put libraries of tapes and books
[1:17:07] in their hands and and and supported
[1:17:10] translations and they're still doing
[1:17:12] that with bible believers still doing a
[1:17:14] great work and
[1:17:16] you know so
[1:17:18] again
[1:17:19] you know 169 times that's almost
[1:17:22] unfathomable of how many times to travel
[1:17:25] across and leave your family leave your
[1:17:27] home
[1:17:28] weeks away and missing birthdays and
[1:17:31] anniversaries and
[1:17:32] and uh you know
[1:17:34] the church sacrificing him to go and and
[1:17:37] on and on and on there's just a lot of
[1:17:40] giving that has went on
[1:17:42] and i i kind of know what it is to spend
[1:17:44] weeks away from home i've been there
[1:17:46] several times to new zealand preaching
[1:17:49] conventions of fiji islands and
[1:17:51] preaching in underground churches in
[1:17:53] china

[1:19:30] full time in them into the ministry and
[1:19:34] you ask where are the missionaries
[1:19:37] in this church i want to just know we
[1:19:39] are part of a great voice
[1:19:44] amen you know it's not one person that
[1:19:47] has done it but give me another one
[1:19:49] another picture as we just show but you
[1:19:51] know here's brother and sister biscuit
[1:19:53] now they're they're celebrating at 68
[1:19:56] years of marriage and what a what a
[1:19:59] tribute they have been to the bride of
[1:20:02] christ and and honorable people that has
[1:20:05] carried the word of god and and carried
[1:20:07] it with dignity and bringing forth not
[1:20:10] their own ideas but the the revelation
[1:20:14] brought by the messenger
[1:20:16] are you with me
[1:20:17] amen and these men have have carried the
[1:20:20] message sister ruth going with him many
[1:20:22] times and there's brother ron who is
[1:20:24] still going in fact i've had to say to
[1:20:27] him
[1:20:27] you know this this year because he's got
[1:20:30] one meeting planned after another
[1:20:31] meeting after another meeting after
[1:20:33] another meeting i just talked to him
[1:20:34] yesterday and said
[1:20:36] how are you going to keep doing this
[1:20:39] you know you're you're expending your
[1:20:40] energy and your time he's putting
[1:20:42] everything into it and yet with four
[1:20:44] stage cancer and it's because that he's
[1:20:47] a voice
[1:20:49] in this end time
[1:20:51] and he's part of the prophecy of what
[1:20:53] god is doing in this last day
[1:20:56] amen and then brother biscuit sitting
[1:20:58] there as you see um
[1:21:01] you know and then myself here we we're
[1:21:03] just uh we're just all small pebbles on
[1:21:06] the beach
[1:21:07] you know god gave the word but great was
[1:21:10] the company of those who published it
[1:21:13] and i want you to remember as a church
[1:21:15] body that you are part of a voice
[1:21:18] i think as i i i believe it was five or
[1:21:22] six
[1:21:23] new sermons of brother branham's that we
[1:21:25] just translated
[1:21:27] got paid for translation into japanese
[1:21:30] and and so this month we got that many
[1:21:33] more on the hub and we're pushing close
[1:21:36] to over 200 where there wasn't any
[1:21:39] there on the uh in the the messages in
[1:21:43] japanese but but but because it god
[1:21:45] orchestrated a moment
[1:21:47] and brother timothy and brother craig
[1:21:50] and then danny domindo and these
[1:21:52] brothers would meet with these
[1:21:54] translators right at the 11th hour
[1:21:56] lighted right as they were leaving for
[1:21:58] the airport and meet with these this man
[1:22:01] and his wife and
[1:22:03] the message become real to them and she
[1:22:05] because she is a she's a professional
[1:22:08] translator
[1:22:09] into the japanese language and now we've
[1:22:12] got messages there for the japanese
[1:22:15] people to hear we're still doing mission
[1:22:17] work
[1:22:18] japan is closed right now visitors can't
[1:22:21] get in
[1:22:22] but the message still gets in
[1:22:25] and and and they hear the sermons that
[1:22:28] we preach right here at this pulpit and
[1:22:30] and getting the sermons we're
[1:22:31] translating of the prophet of god and
[1:22:34] and and and so you know again we're
[1:22:36] still working
[1:22:38] even though that things are changing and
[1:22:41] and as it changes there just becomes
[1:22:44] more of a burden on our own shoulders
[1:22:47] and a greater responsibility to carry
[1:22:50] this message that has been committed to
[1:22:52] us in this day
[1:22:54] and so i as that i wanted to read a
[1:22:58] scripture this morning
[1:22:59] there as we look at us being a great
[1:23:02] voice i'm going to entitle this
[1:23:04] abraham's voice
[1:23:06] and i'm going to look at revelation
[1:23:08] chapter 19 and verse 1
[1:23:11] where we will read from for another
[1:23:14] scripture reading and then i have one
[1:23:16] from colossians
[1:23:17] and we'll just see how the lord will
[1:23:19] lead us as to
[1:23:21] how far we get into this today
[1:23:24] after these things i heard a great voice
[1:23:27] of much people in heaven
[1:23:29] saying hallelujah salvation and glory
[1:23:32] and honor and power
[1:23:34] unto the lord our god
[1:23:37] for true and righteous are his judgment
[1:23:40] he had judged the great which did
[1:23:42] corrupt the earth with her fornication
[1:23:45] and hath avenged the blood of his
[1:23:46] servants at her hand
[1:23:48] and again they said alleluia and her
[1:23:51] smoke rose up forever and ever
[1:23:54] and the four and twenty elders and four
[1:23:56] beasts fell down and worshiped god that
[1:23:58] sat on the throne saying amen hallelujah
[1:24:02] and a voice came out of the throne
[1:24:05] saying praise our god all ye his
[1:24:08] servants and ye that fear him both small
[1:24:11] and great
[1:24:12] and i heard as it were the voice of a
[1:24:15] great multitude and as a voice of many
[1:24:18] waters and as a voice of mighty
[1:24:20] thundering saying hallelujah for the
[1:24:23] lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be
[1:24:26] glad and give honor to him for the
[1:24:29] marriage of the lamb has come
[1:24:31] and his wife has made herself ready
[1:24:34] and to her was granted that she should
[1:24:36] be arrayed and find linen
[1:24:38] clean and white for the final inning is
[1:24:40] the righteousness of saints
[1:24:43] and he said unto me right blessed are
[1:24:45] they which are called unto the marriage
[1:24:48] supper of the lamb and he said
[1:24:51] these are the true saiyans of god
[1:24:55] then i'd like you to turn with me to
[1:24:57] colossians chapter 1
[1:24:59] and we'll read from verse 12
[1:25:01] for this scripture reading
[1:25:03] given thanks to unto the father which
[1:25:06] hath made us meet to be partakers of the
[1:25:09] inheritance of the saint and light
[1:25:11] who
[1:25:12] delivered us who have delivered us from
[1:25:14] the power of darkness how many have been
[1:25:16] delivered from the power of darkness and
[1:25:19] has translated us
[1:25:21] into the kingdom of his dear son you
[1:25:24] know how that happens amen the kingdom
[1:25:27] of god is not meat and drink his
[1:25:29] righteousness peace and joy in the holy
[1:25:31] ghost so our kingdom the kingdom of god
[1:25:34] comes by the holy ghost
[1:25:36] and he says and in whom we have
[1:25:38] redemption to his blood
[1:25:40] even the forgiveness of sin
[1:25:43] who is the in image of the invisible god
[1:25:47] the firstborn of every creature
[1:25:49] for by him were all things created that
[1:25:52] are in heaven and that are in earth
[1:25:54] visible and invisible whether they be
[1:25:57] thrones or dominions or principalities
[1:25:59] or power
[1:26:00] all things were created by him and for
[1:26:03] him and he is before all things and by
[1:26:07] him all things consist
[1:26:10] and he is the head of the body the
[1:26:12] church who is the beginning the
[1:26:14] firstborn from the dead
[1:26:16] that in all things he might have
[1:26:18] preeminence
[1:26:20] and for it please the father that in him
[1:26:22] should all fullness dwell
[1:26:26] so now as we are looking at this i
[1:26:28] wanted to look at verse 18 one more time
[1:26:32] where he says that in all things
[1:26:35] he might have preeminence
[1:26:39] now god had a threefold purpose
[1:26:42] and a threefold plan of what he would do
[1:26:45] to bring about
[1:26:47] um the transition of us from this life
[1:26:50] of sin
[1:26:51] back to eden again
[1:26:53] and that is the longing in our heart
[1:26:55] like i sang that song we're longing for
[1:26:58] jesus to come back
[1:27:00] listen all our efforts everything that
[1:27:02] we've done you know all amounts to
[1:27:06] really nothing unless jesus comes back
[1:27:09] we're looking for the coming of the lord
[1:27:11] jesus
[1:27:13] and and so his purpose when he came 2
[1:27:16] 000 years ago was to first reveal
[1:27:19] himself in christ
[1:27:22] god so loved fatherhood
[1:27:25] that he wanted a family
[1:27:28] and so he created a man but when man
[1:27:31] sinned that we know
[1:27:33] rather than discarding the human race he
[1:27:36] became one of us
[1:27:38] to save us and to redeem us
[1:27:41] so he would come to reveal himself in
[1:27:44] christ
[1:27:45] and of course he had been revealing
[1:27:46] himself down to the ages he would
[1:27:49] actually reveal himself and adam and and
[1:27:52] and abel when abel would bring a lamb
[1:27:55] that was a re revelation of christ
[1:27:58] when when enoch would walk by faith and
[1:28:01] and be translated that was a revelation
[1:28:03] of christ
[1:28:05] when when um
[1:28:06] when noah would build an ark and and
[1:28:09] save his household that was a revelation
[1:28:12] of christ it was christ
[1:28:14] the mystery of god that was being hid in
[1:28:17] those men and women
[1:28:19] down to the ages and down through time
[1:28:22] until that when we look at the bible we
[1:28:25] can now look back and we can see that
[1:28:27] jesus
[1:28:28] is the principal theme of the entire
[1:28:31] bible
[1:28:32] and that if you read the bible and you
[1:28:35] don't see christ in every verse of it
[1:28:37] that you should go back and read it
[1:28:39] again
[1:28:40] because you have missed it you see
[1:28:43] you you missed the the real context of
[1:28:47] what god was doing that
[1:28:49] it was more than a story
[1:28:52] but there was a voice that was being
[1:28:54] spoken and it was the voice of god and
[1:28:58] it was his omnipotence and his power
[1:29:01] that was being shown
[1:29:03] and and
[1:29:04] as they're seen in revelation 19
[1:29:08] all of all of them thundering out the
[1:29:10] lord god omnipotent reigneth
[1:29:13] and then for time it was a thunder it
[1:29:16] was a noise and we didn't know what it
[1:29:18] meant there were no stories in the bible
[1:29:21] but we have more than stories to us
[1:29:23] today
[1:29:24] and because why god has revealed to us
[1:29:28] the context
[1:29:29] not just not just reading the history
[1:29:32] and the bible but we see more than just
[1:29:35] a story in the bible we see what that
[1:29:39] god was doing something and he was
[1:29:42] reflecting something and he was
[1:29:44] foreshadowing
[1:29:46] and speaking out of their lives
[1:29:48] in such a way that um that now those
[1:29:52] words that will be spoken them would one
[1:29:54] day be manifested in christ
[1:29:57] you see it was more than just a story of
[1:30:00] an old man
[1:30:01] given the ultimate sacrifice of a child
[1:30:04] and and this child 16 years old isaac
[1:30:07] the promised son oh what a test of faith
[1:30:10] it was more than that
[1:30:12] it was more than just a story of how
[1:30:14] nice it was that abraham believed god
[1:30:16] and would even believe he would raise
[1:30:18] him up from the dead but you know it was
[1:30:21] more than that he was actually
[1:30:23] foreshadowing
[1:30:24] he was a voice that was speaking out
[1:30:28] and he was prophesied
[1:30:30] of the coming messiah
[1:30:33] and he was telling that oh he would one
[1:30:36] day god would bring his son upon that
[1:30:38] very same hill
[1:30:40] and there he would offer his son
[1:30:43] come on church amen and because here god
[1:30:46] would provide a sacrifice he would show
[1:30:49] himself jehovah jirei and he would show
[1:30:52] himself in his omnipotence by creating a
[1:30:55] ram by abraham's words because abraham's
[1:30:59] words became
[1:31:01] life and they spoke out of him god will
[1:31:04] provide a sacrifice and a lamb a ram is
[1:31:09] found there tangled there in the they're
[1:31:11] waiting to be the sacrifice because a
[1:31:14] man became god's voice
[1:31:21] now as we think of that
[1:31:23] you know when you look now and we see
[1:31:26] now what was in abraham we see it's more
[1:31:29] than that that rhyme was more
[1:31:32] there was more than a a round that was
[1:31:34] spoke but god would speak a son into
[1:31:36] existence
[1:31:38] the word would become flesh
[1:31:40] and that word then would be provided for
[1:31:44] a sacrifice
[1:31:46] now we look and we can see it was a
[1:31:48] voice it was the voice of god
[1:31:51] that was speaking out through abraham's
[1:31:54] life
[1:31:58] now looking at that
[1:32:01] when we go back and we look at christ
[1:32:04] we can see him now from all the way from
[1:32:07] genesis to revelation
[1:32:10] we can see him from the beginning in the
[1:32:12] beginning god
[1:32:14] created the heavens the earth how did he
[1:32:16] do that by the word
[1:32:18] who was the word that was christ
[1:32:21] before he became jesus
[1:32:23] before he took on flesh somebody help me
[1:32:26] amen so from the very beginning it was
[1:32:29] god created the heavens and the earth
[1:32:31] all the way that to the amen in
[1:32:33] revelation it is every word testifying
[1:32:37] of jesus christ
[1:32:40] now
[1:32:41] god as the groom was fully revealed in
[1:32:44] christ
[1:32:45] insomuch that the fullness of the
[1:32:48] godhead
[1:32:50] bodily dwelt in him in other words the
[1:32:53] fullness of all the scriptures
[1:32:56] you see jesus would say search the
[1:32:59] scriptures then he would say to the
[1:33:01] denominational people of that day the
[1:33:03] pharisees he said in them you think you
[1:33:07] have eternal life but they are
[1:33:09] testifying they're everyone pointing to
[1:33:13] me
[1:33:14] they're all testifying of who i am
[1:33:17] whether you're reading in the beginning
[1:33:19] god whether you're reading about noah
[1:33:22] whether you're reading about uh
[1:33:25] elijah no matter whether you're reading
[1:33:28] whatever you're reading about it's all
[1:33:30] justifying to me jesus said
[1:33:33] amen i i i am the interpretation
[1:33:38] now we see the bigger picture than that
[1:33:40] of abraham
[1:33:43] amen we see we see more than just a man
[1:33:47] called out of the chaldeans and he he's
[1:33:49] a nice man and god calls him and he
[1:33:52] raises them up a family and they become
[1:33:54] the jewish people and oh that's a great
[1:33:57] story of the jewish race and we got a
[1:33:59] bible out of that and so now we're we're
[1:34:02] we all believe the bible it's more than
[1:34:04] that
[1:34:05] but god was speaking
[1:34:08] in that day in that hour
[1:34:11] now as we're looking at this remember he
[1:34:15] would say to those pharisees you think
[1:34:17] you have eternal life in there
[1:34:20] but they're testifying to me
[1:34:22] everyone are speaking and pointing to me
[1:34:25] you see the scriptures bear witness and
[1:34:28] bear record of me and i'm bearing
[1:34:31] records of them so therefore if i don't
[1:34:34] do the works
[1:34:35] that is promised i would do then don't
[1:34:37] believe me
[1:34:39] am i but if i do the works if i if i
[1:34:42] show the omnipotence
[1:34:46] if i show you the omnipotence that was
[1:34:48] shown when abraham spoke a lamb
[1:34:51] if i show you the omnipotence amen when
[1:34:55] when he believed god and a baby was
[1:34:57] formed in a 90 year old woman that took
[1:35:00] omnipotent power
[1:35:02] amen are you with me amen so there again
[1:35:05] he said if you don't believe me believe
[1:35:07] the omnipotence
[1:35:09] believe the works believe it when you
[1:35:11] see the blind eye open when you see the
[1:35:14] crippled walk when you see the depth
[1:35:16] here when you see the word proclaim
[1:35:19] believe it
[1:35:23] because i am what they were manifesting
[1:35:27] now all
[1:35:28] encapsulated in one body
[1:35:31] called jesus
[1:35:36] the word testify me
[1:35:38] you see that was christ and abraham it
[1:35:40] was christ and moses
[1:35:42] it was christ and the prophets
[1:35:44] it was the hidden power that was in
[1:35:46] samson
[1:35:48] come on
[1:35:49] it's more than a story of a of a little
[1:35:51] shrimp
[1:35:52] there that you know that somehow another
[1:35:54] could tear down walls and rip apart
[1:35:57] lions and and could carry the heavy
[1:36:00] gates and do the great things that he
[1:36:02] did or killed thousands of philistines
[1:36:04] and more than that there was a hidden
[1:36:05] power
[1:36:07] and who was that omnipotence that was in
[1:36:09] him you see he was given voice to the
[1:36:13] christ that was coming
[1:36:17] now whether it was
[1:36:19] in the psalms of david
[1:36:21] or the wisdom of solomon
[1:36:24] in other words he was the fullness of
[1:36:26] the law and the prophets
[1:36:28] all in one body
[1:36:30] he said before abraham was i am
[1:36:34] think of that
[1:36:35] before abraham was i am i was there that
[1:36:39] was me there
[1:36:41] before he came i was there
[1:36:44] amen and while he was there i was there
[1:36:47] it was me
[1:36:49] it was me and the burning bush with
[1:36:51] moses
[1:36:52] it was me there calling him out calling
[1:36:55] abraham out of chaldea it was me there
[1:36:58] teaching him how to sacrifice it was me
[1:37:00] there standing else else shadia the
[1:37:02] almighty
[1:37:03] amen that could change sarah and an old
[1:37:06] woman and make her young again and able
[1:37:09] to bear a child
[1:37:11] somebody help me preach now
[1:37:13] now you see
[1:37:15] jesus proved he was the word he was the
[1:37:17] word in abraham he was the word in moses
[1:37:20] he was the word in the prophets and on
[1:37:23] easter morning when he arose triumphant
[1:37:25] he showed he was not on the mechanics
[1:37:27] but the dynamics of it
[1:37:30] amen he didn't just have a claim but the
[1:37:32] power was there to prove
[1:37:36] that he was this he was the resurrection
[1:37:39] life
[1:37:40] and then he showed his omnipotence he
[1:37:43] raised from the dead he clamped over
[1:37:46] death hell in the grave are you with me
[1:37:49] amen you see that dynamic power was the
[1:37:52] power that translated enoch
[1:37:55] it was the power that destroyed noah's
[1:37:57] world
[1:37:58] amen it was a dynamic power that got a
[1:38:01] hold of david's sling and took a measly
[1:38:04] stone and turned it into a bullet that
[1:38:06] was a speed of a thousand miles per
[1:38:08] second and hit a giant right between the
[1:38:11] eyes
[1:38:12] amen that was christ
[1:38:14] it was the dynamics and it made the body
[1:38:17] of jesus christ that was cold and stiff
[1:38:20] and dead in the tomb
[1:38:22] shake the life again and rise and
[1:38:24] rolling away the stone
[1:38:27] you see he not only he not only was the
[1:38:30] mechanics of god's word but he was the
[1:38:33] dynamics to prove it
[1:38:36] are you with me now
[1:38:38] but you see if we just leave it in
[1:38:40] christ
[1:38:42] we we are just we are missing a great
[1:38:45] part of it
[1:38:47] because god has a body on the earth
[1:38:51] his body called jesus is in the heavens
[1:38:54] and one day he will come in the place
[1:38:57] expanded to redeem us and we'll meet him
[1:38:59] in the air
[1:39:01] is that right
[1:39:02] but right now he has a body on the earth
[1:39:05] and i want you to know this bright body
[1:39:08] is a body that is the fullness of the
[1:39:11] godhead
[1:39:12] all the scriptures encapsulated in a
[1:39:15] people called the bride
[1:39:18] it's not working in just one person
[1:39:23] are you with me amen it's not just with
[1:39:26] one man
[1:39:27] you see jesus said i gotta go away if i
[1:39:30] don't go the comforter can't come and if
[1:39:33] the comforter can't come well you know i
[1:39:35] can only go to this place and go to that
[1:39:38] place and touch this one and touch that
[1:39:40] one and open that blind eye but if i
[1:39:43] come again
[1:39:46] i'm going to come in another form
[1:39:49] amen i'm not going to return yet in my
[1:39:52] physical body i'm going away i'll do my
[1:39:55] intercession work but i'm going to have
[1:39:57] a body on earth
[1:39:58] and that body will be a people
[1:40:01] that body will be a pride
[1:40:03] and he didn't just feel one with the
[1:40:05] spirit of jesus on the day of pentecost
[1:40:08] he filled 120
[1:40:10] with the spirit of jesus i'm talking
[1:40:13] about the same dynamic power
[1:40:15] that was in jesus christ came in 120
[1:40:20] and after that uh 3 000 more and then
[1:40:23] more and then more and then more unto
[1:40:26] you today and you and you and you
[1:40:32] that same omnipotent power
[1:40:36] at work that same holy ghost
[1:40:39] not a different spirit
[1:40:42] the same holy spirit
[1:40:44] amen now so therefore
[1:40:46] our challenge anymore is not just go
[1:40:49] back and see christ in every and every
[1:40:52] part of the scripture
[1:40:53] but to see the bride in every part
[1:40:57] [Music]
[1:40:58] you see because you know the groom
[1:41:00] coming is yet in the future he came 2000
[1:41:03] years ago he won't come to the earth
[1:41:05] until after the after or just before the
[1:41:08] millennium after the
[1:41:10] the wedding supper he won't come to
[1:41:12] earth we meet him in the air
[1:41:15] so the only way he's going to be here
[1:41:17] physically
[1:41:18] is in a corporal body
[1:41:21] called the bride
[1:41:25] and he's the same in every detail
[1:41:28] except that corporal body
[1:41:33] you see it doesn't look like jesus and
[1:41:35] don't have the stature of jesus
[1:41:38] amen it's a different kind of a man
[1:41:41] amen but it's the same jesus
[1:41:44] in bright form
[1:41:46] hallelujah
[1:41:47] amen do you realize people are talking
[1:41:49] about the revealing of the son of man
[1:41:52] and certainly the son of man was
[1:41:54] revealed the word was made known by the
[1:41:56] prophet of malachi 4 but do you realize
[1:41:59] you
[1:42:00] for the last 56 years since the prophet
[1:42:04] have been gone have been revealing the
[1:42:06] son of man
[1:42:08] the word the same word is being revealed
[1:42:11] where
[1:42:12] in bright form
[1:42:14] [Music]
[1:42:16] this is where brother branham would say
[1:42:18] god
[1:42:19] god in in the heavens
[1:42:22] god in christ
[1:42:24] and now god in his people
[1:42:30] now
[1:42:32] so to how the preeminence
[1:42:34] and the people notice now
[1:42:37] here
[1:42:38] what i'm seeing
[1:42:39] what i'm seeing in this scripture like
[1:42:41] this
[1:42:42] where he's saying this where
[1:42:44] where um
[1:42:46] where this voice is coming out and it's
[1:42:49] saying hallelujah look at verse 6 of
[1:42:51] chapter 19.
[1:42:53] and then there's a voice of mighty
[1:42:55] thunderings and the voice of many waters
[1:42:58] and brother branham would tell us that
[1:43:00] voice
[1:43:01] the voice of god is not one voice
[1:43:06] come on
[1:43:07] amen the voice of god is one of many
[1:43:10] waters it's one voice
[1:43:12] but of many waters
[1:43:15] and those waters are multitude stickness
[1:43:18] and and and people
[1:43:21] are you with me
[1:43:22] that makes you a voice
[1:43:26] i i want you to understand the world may
[1:43:29] not understand the voice
[1:43:31] because to them is only a thunder
[1:43:36] it's only a noise they think oh that
[1:43:39] peculiar bunch of people
[1:43:41] those fanatical butts that get up and
[1:43:44] shout and rejoice in the word and the
[1:43:46] truth and that sings the song the zion
[1:43:49] will dance out in the aisle those people
[1:43:52] you know
[1:43:53] that's just a noise and it's just a
[1:43:56] noise to them
[1:43:58] amen come on when jesus was going to
[1:44:00] calvary didn't he go down and he
[1:44:02] thundered from the heaven
[1:44:04] amen somehow i heard a thunder the other
[1:44:07] said an angel spoke
[1:44:08] and jesus knew what it said
[1:44:12] come on church there ought to be a
[1:44:14] people today that is realizing what the
[1:44:16] word is said about it it's not just a
[1:44:18] noise
[1:44:20] it's not just a clap of thunder
[1:44:23] i mean the world may hear it and they
[1:44:25] say that just noise to me that don't
[1:44:27] make any sense i don't understand them
[1:44:30] women with their long hair and their
[1:44:31] dresses i don't understand those men and
[1:44:34] their clean look i don't understand why
[1:44:36] they're the way they are but they're a
[1:44:38] voice
[1:44:38] [Applause]
[1:44:41] and some only hear it as a thunder
[1:44:46] and when when many well even the jewish
[1:44:49] people when they when they read the
[1:44:51] scripture about abraham they don't see
[1:44:54] christ in there
[1:44:59] they don't see a type and a shadow
[1:45:02] they don't see a projection or a
[1:45:04] prophecy
[1:45:06] oh they see that's our father abraham
[1:45:08] and they take it literally
[1:45:12] but we can look at and see it was
[1:45:14] speaking prophetically
[1:45:16] so to them is still a thunder
[1:45:19] it's still a noise
[1:45:21] and it will still be a noise and just a
[1:45:24] thunder until their prophets come and
[1:45:26] then it will be a voice
[1:45:28] and they'll see the messiah and oh
[1:45:31] that's the one david talked about that
[1:45:33] was the wisdom of solomon that was there
[1:45:36] in abel's land that was the one down
[1:45:38] through you will see it just like you
[1:45:40] see it today
[1:45:44] hallelujah
[1:45:45] and then they will see we are the
[1:45:47] elected jews the 144 thousand amen
[1:45:51] they're our counterpart right now that's
[1:45:53] what's been revealed to you by this
[1:45:55] message it broke the thunder off the
[1:45:57] scripture
[1:45:58] it opened up the voice of god to you
[1:46:01] where it's not just a noise a nice
[1:46:03] stunning you know a nice something to
[1:46:05] put you to sleep at night when you go
[1:46:07] through that it's god speaking
[1:46:11] abraham's got a voice
[1:46:16] and that voice
[1:46:18] is now being lived out
[1:46:20] in a people
[1:46:23] a people whose meeting their shady eye
[1:46:25] just like he did
[1:46:28] because this is type in the holy ghost
[1:46:30] and this is typing where a believer
[1:46:32] comes and and he nurses from the breast
[1:46:35] about said i
[1:46:37] and receives the strength are you with
[1:46:39] me amen so
[1:46:40] again all the scripture
[1:46:43] as a noise of great thundering go back
[1:46:46] to put verse six up again heard the
[1:46:48] voice of a great multitude and the voice
[1:46:51] of many waters and the voice of mighty
[1:46:55] thunderings
[1:46:57] and they're all saying one thing
[1:47:00] the lord god omnipotent reigneth
[1:47:04] to reign he has to have preeminence
[1:47:08] the lord god is praying preeminent he
[1:47:11] has found the people
[1:47:15] amen abraham could say i didn't fully
[1:47:18] reflect him
[1:47:19] you can look at your life and you can
[1:47:20] see parts where you didn't reflect him
[1:47:23] but oh when you come to the new covenant
[1:47:26] to the next new testament and you cross
[1:47:28] through the blood of the cross
[1:47:30] i mean you hear a whole different story
[1:47:33] amen the voice of abraham's mistakes and
[1:47:37] his failures are all gone and the only
[1:47:40] voice you hear is abraham he staggered
[1:47:43] not at the promise of god through
[1:47:45] unbelief but he was strong into faith
[1:47:50] it doesn't show him laughing it doesn't
[1:47:52] show him wondering it doesn't show him
[1:47:55] going down to egypt it doesn't show him
[1:47:58] well you know in his failures it don't
[1:48:00] show him lying
[1:48:02] it shows him what victorious
[1:48:05] because that was the only voice god was
[1:48:08] going to receive
[1:48:10] that's my voice
[1:48:14] and god credited him
[1:48:16] for speaking his voice
[1:48:24] i heard the great voice
[1:48:26] of a great multitude the voice of many
[1:48:28] waters
[1:48:30] the voice of mighty thunderings
[1:48:33] enoch's voices in there
[1:48:35] i was the seventh from adam
[1:48:39] i walked with god
[1:48:41] but you know there was some years i
[1:48:43] didn't i didn't walk with him you know
[1:48:45] that's the history
[1:48:48] but when it's written in the book of
[1:48:49] hebrews it's not mentioned
[1:48:52] it doesn't mention the the years that he
[1:48:54] didn't walk with god
[1:48:56] amen the 65 years the bible said he
[1:48:59] walked he he he lived for for um
[1:49:03] 365 years
[1:49:06] i think of that a day
[1:49:08] a day of the years or a year's day is
[1:49:11] 365 he walked with god a year's worth
[1:49:16] he walked with god 365
[1:49:20] years or he lived for 365 years but he
[1:49:23] 65 of it he didn't walk with god
[1:49:26] he walked with god 300 years
[1:49:30] you see no matter who we are
[1:49:33] we have our past
[1:49:35] we have our mistakes
[1:49:38] great men we've shown great men here on
[1:49:41] the on the the projector here today
[1:49:44] great man among us but they've made
[1:49:46] their mistakes
[1:49:48] i've made my mistakes you make your
[1:49:50] mistakes
[1:49:52] amen but when it all covered it didn't
[1:49:55] say i remember his mistake and that that
[1:49:59] those years that he didn't walk with god
[1:50:02] i see by faith
[1:50:05] enoch was translated that he would not
[1:50:07] see death
[1:50:10] hallelujah amen why because because he
[1:50:15] walked with god and was not it never
[1:50:18] talks about the years he didn't walk
[1:50:19] with god he talked about only the years
[1:50:22] he walked with god
[1:50:25] because that was god's voice
[1:50:32] now
[1:50:33] i hear it
[1:50:35] as a voice of mighty thunderings
[1:50:38] there's many things in the bible
[1:50:41] that are still just thunders
[1:50:44] to many people
[1:50:49] it's a book that
[1:50:51] is full of mysteries
[1:50:53] it's still a sealed book
[1:50:56] it's closed
[1:50:59] and they don't go and read it and it's
[1:51:01] close with the jews their eyes are
[1:51:03] blinded it's a closed book
[1:51:07] they hear the noise of it
[1:51:09] but they don't see the purpose they
[1:51:11] don't hear the voice
[1:51:13] you see
[1:51:14] but i want you to get it that in every
[1:51:17] one of these
[1:51:19] it was where god reigned
[1:51:24] when god reigned in abraham's life
[1:51:27] when he gave the word preeminence
[1:51:33] over his thoughts over his body weakness
[1:51:37] over the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:51:39] he had to give the word preeminence
[1:51:46] now you know a lot of times people
[1:51:48] listen to christ the mystery of god
[1:51:49] revealed and they think oh you know when
[1:51:51] the church oh god it gives him
[1:51:54] preeminence let me just say to you every
[1:51:56] person who's ever been filled with the
[1:51:58] holy ghost to get it you had to give the
[1:52:00] word preeminence
[1:52:04] he had to be first
[1:52:07] everything else
[1:52:09] you know it's a marriage contract
[1:52:11] and everybody else is out of the picture
[1:52:14] no other lovers
[1:52:16] no other person
[1:52:18] nobody between you and me
[1:52:21] everyone with the baptism of the holy
[1:52:23] ghost you got it when you gave him
[1:52:25] preeminence
[1:52:27] when you said lord take over the
[1:52:29] leadership i can't lead no more
[1:52:31] when you said lord i can't handle this
[1:52:33] habit i've tried to give it up over and
[1:52:35] over but you come
[1:52:38] you come and take it oh i give you
[1:52:40] preeminence i put it in your hands
[1:52:43] amen so again you see in all of it that
[1:52:46] he might have the preeminence
[1:52:49] you see jesus is the principal theme of
[1:52:52] the bible but now you become the
[1:52:55] principal theme of the bible you see
[1:52:58] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:53:01] how many believes that
[1:53:03] let me ask you again so that everybody's
[1:53:06] participating from the front to the back
[1:53:08] you know how many believes that that
[1:53:11] that christ is the mystery of god reveal
[1:53:15] raise your hands
[1:53:17] you believe that amen now then let's go
[1:53:20] a little further but i don't leave it
[1:53:23] there
[1:53:24] because the bride is the mystery of
[1:53:27] christ revealed
[1:53:32] amen you are the mystery
[1:53:36] hallelujah you are the mystery you see
[1:53:40] these mysteries brother damn this
[1:53:41] mystery of this mystery that mystery
[1:53:43] this you are the mystery
[1:53:46] those aren't the mystery you're the
[1:53:48] mystery
[1:53:49] the mystery was god had
[1:53:51] foreign god was calling the church
[1:53:55] god was pulling the people out for his
[1:53:58] namesake
[1:54:01] what is the mystery about the bible way
[1:54:04] house
[1:54:05] why would they have to leave the
[1:54:06] denominations and their homes there and
[1:54:09] everything else and start a little place
[1:54:12] in a little uh a little house and little
[1:54:14] meetings there in the bible way how how
[1:54:17] come it would happen with us in little
[1:54:19] home meetings and then and an old
[1:54:21] run-down church with broken window panes
[1:54:25] how come it would be is because there
[1:54:27] was something in our hearts
[1:54:30] just like the jews that said we've been
[1:54:32] in the holocaust
[1:54:35] but we'll never do that again
[1:54:37] we'll never be in a place where our
[1:54:39] children are are cremated and are old or
[1:54:42] are killed and and are
[1:54:45] well or made slaves will never be and
[1:54:48] that again will never stand for to be
[1:54:50] annihilated again we want a homeland
[1:54:54] and there was something in the hearts of
[1:54:56] men and women that were saying you know
[1:54:58] we had homes in baptist or methodist or
[1:55:01] presbyterian or pentecostal for years
[1:55:04] and years my daddy was there my
[1:55:06] granddaddy my great-granddaddy he was a
[1:55:08] charter member and on and on and on we
[1:55:10] were there and we we thought this was
[1:55:12] our home it wasn't our home
[1:55:15] all of a sudden it's turned into
[1:55:17] holocaust
[1:55:19] it's turned air into places where where
[1:55:22] souls of men and women were withered and
[1:55:25] died
[1:55:26] where the young people look at the
[1:55:27] churches today they're literally
[1:55:30] holocaust where are there young people
[1:55:33] every one of them will cry to you we
[1:55:34] don't have no young people our young
[1:55:36] people are going why is it
[1:55:39] because they have turned them into death
[1:55:41] camps
[1:55:44] amen the cremate them and burn them with
[1:55:47] fire and they die die die die the spirit
[1:55:51] has been gone for years years years
[1:55:55] but why was there a bible way house why
[1:55:57] was there an evening like tabernacle why
[1:55:59] did we go into a dimly lit place why did
[1:56:02] we leave our homes out there and go
[1:56:04] there because we wanted a homeland
[1:56:08] where the bible is preached
[1:56:10] we wanted a homeland where our souls
[1:56:13] could be fed why young people could have
[1:56:16] an experience with god and be changed we
[1:56:19] wanted something that was real
[1:56:22] and we do whatever it would take
[1:56:28] hallelujah and just as jews are right
[1:56:30] now being gathered out of ukraine and
[1:56:34] taken back and having their aaliyah in
[1:56:37] israel let me tell you right now there's
[1:56:40] a bride around the world and there's a
[1:56:42] star going on
[1:56:44] there's a spiritual war that's been
[1:56:46] taking place and because of the war what
[1:56:50] is it it's uprooting people i want a
[1:56:52] homeland i've got to get to safety i got
[1:56:55] to get to christ i must find jesus
[1:56:58] [Applause]
[1:57:01] that's why your prodigals are coming
[1:57:02] home
[1:57:04] because there's a stir in the hearts
[1:57:07] god calling the last ones back
[1:57:11] hallelujah
[1:57:14] hallelujah
[1:57:17] said god
[1:57:18] as the groom would fully reveal himself
[1:57:20] in christ
[1:57:22] and now he would reveal himself in
[1:57:24] bride's form
[1:57:26] so his desire and his plan
[1:57:29] was to have the preeminence
[1:57:31] in his body of believers that is his
[1:57:34] bride that he might live in his people
[1:57:38] you see god wanted a people he could
[1:57:41] live in
[1:57:42] that he could go to church in
[1:57:46] this tabernacle isn't to dwell in place
[1:57:48] of living god this building you're the
[1:57:51] tabernacle of the living god
[1:57:53] amen and jesus brought you to church
[1:57:56] this morning
[1:57:58] you didn't even bring yourself jesus
[1:58:00] brought you to church
[1:58:03] hallelujah because it's his custom it's
[1:58:06] the custom of jesus to go to the house
[1:58:10] of god and worship
[1:58:12] [Music]
[1:58:13] is that right and it rose up within you
[1:58:17] you might have said i'm tired i'm weary
[1:58:19] i'm this i'm that you know brother tim
[1:58:21] will be back he'll preach a long time i
[1:58:22] don't know if i can take it off and
[1:58:24] something rolls up in here i gotta go
[1:58:29] and you're here
[1:58:31] hallelujah amen amen and what is it it's
[1:58:34] that jesus worshiping god out of you
[1:58:42] because he's going to have preeminence
[1:58:44] in his body of believers that is his
[1:58:47] bride that he might live
[1:58:49] in his people
[1:58:51] having first to reveal himself in christ
[1:58:54] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:58:57] and then to bring that fullness
[1:59:00] of the godhead bodily into a people
[1:59:04] now brother branham's telling us exactly
[1:59:06] what god's doing i am bringing the
[1:59:09] fullness
[1:59:10] of the godhead bodily
[1:59:12] now into a people
[1:59:14] so all the word
[1:59:17] of the entire bible is going to be
[1:59:20] heaped up
[1:59:21] into a bright people
[1:59:25] this is why she's a word bride
[1:59:28] because she's the word of of uh of the
[1:59:31] seed

[1:59:36] of abel
[1:59:38] she is the word of noah
[1:59:40] she is the word of enoch
[1:59:43] she is the word of abraham

[2:00:22] amen and here was a woman now she would
[2:00:25] have seven devils cast out of her
[2:00:30] do you know you're that woman

[2:00:45] antichrist teachings immorality and sin

[2:00:54] the one who could have judged us and was
[2:00:57] the judge did not judge us
[2:00:59] but said neither do i condemn you go and
[2:01:02] disbelieve no more
[2:01:05] hallelujah you're that woman you are
[2:01:08] that woman
[2:01:09] you are that ruth you are that come on
[2:01:12] church you are that people you are that
[2:01:15] esther
[2:01:22] expressed in jesus christ
[2:01:24] who was both father son and holy ghost
[2:01:27] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[2:01:29] now the complete fullness of the godhead
[2:01:32] bodily dwells in his church supremacists
[2:01:35] all that god was he poured into christ
[2:01:38] and all that christ was was poured into
[2:01:40] the church
[2:01:42] the believers
[2:01:45] amen
[2:01:46] and if he as he says in rising unto the
[2:01:49] son and he be in the groom
[2:01:52] the bride has to come forth because it's
[2:01:55] part of him
[2:01:58] do you realize for a moment
[2:02:00] you know
[2:02:02] he's not complete
[2:02:04] without you

[2:03:46] right things to righteousness
[2:03:49] are you with me
[2:03:51] amen he said the bride has to come forth
[2:03:53] because it's part of him and it can only
[2:03:56] be the manifestation of the fulfilling
[2:03:59] of all the revelations any other spoke
[2:04:02] of the bride
[2:04:04] so the bride can only be
[2:04:06] the fulfilling of all the other
[2:04:07] revelations that spoke of her
[2:04:11] just like jesus could only be to be the
[2:04:13] messiah to be the christ to be the word
[2:04:16] he would have to be the word that was in
[2:04:17] abraham
[2:04:19] he would have to be the words of the
[2:04:20] prophets
[2:04:21] he would have to be the words of the law
[2:04:23] he would have to be the words of the
[2:04:25] psalms he would have to be the wisdom of
[2:04:27] solomon
[2:04:29] i'm bringing it on down
[2:04:31] amen and it
[2:04:33] for to be the bride you can only be
[2:04:36] the fulfilling of all and any
[2:04:37] revelations that spoke of the bride
[2:04:43] hallelujah why he showed a seed was
[2:04:45] coming in the beginning that was a
[2:04:47] serpent bruiser
[2:04:49] and you think you're going to leave out
[2:04:50] of here defeated
[2:04:53] no sir you are that serpent bruiser
[2:04:56] you are that devil defeater
[2:04:58] you are the one called for the sake amen
[2:05:02] that there is no weapon that is formed
[2:05:04] against you that can prosper
[2:05:06] hallelujah that he has declared that
[2:05:09] whatever you bind on earth will be bound
[2:05:12] in heaven all heaven is standing behind
[2:05:15] you
[2:05:17] your sons and daughters of the most high
[2:05:20] god and you are the fulfilling of all
[2:05:23] the revelations of any others that spoke
[2:05:25] of the bride
[2:05:30] the groom spoke of you coming
[2:05:32] the works that i do shall you do also
[2:05:35] sure that included brother branham but
[2:05:37] not all
[2:05:39] that includes you
[2:05:40] you're to do the works of christ
[2:05:43] amen she is flesh
[2:05:45] of his flesh and bone of his bone life
[2:05:47] of his life power of his power she's him
[2:05:50] it can only manifest if it does
[2:05:52] something different from the groom it
[2:05:54] isn't the bride
[2:05:58] amen go back and read your bible again
[2:06:01] it's prophesying of you
[2:06:04] it was the voice you are the
[2:06:07] interpretation
[2:06:08] it was the thunder you are the
[2:06:11] revelation
[2:06:19] as a woman and a man or one the woman
[2:06:21] taken from his side
[2:06:23] she had a spirit of feminist spirit from
[2:06:25] him
[2:06:26] the flesh was from his side
[2:06:28] was both mechanics and dynamics the wife
[2:06:31] the spirit of him the flesh of him put
[2:06:34] together and made the mechanics and the
[2:06:37] dynamics
[2:06:39] so this great voice
[2:06:42] the voice of abraham is crying out
[2:06:45] hallelujah
[2:06:47] for the lord god omnipotence
[2:06:49] reigneth he's revealed himself as
[2:06:52] almighty god
[2:06:53] when he comes to you in the baptism of
[2:06:55] the holy ghost that's what he's showing
[2:06:57] to you he is almighty god
[2:07:00] he is god over every situation
[2:07:03] he is lord over all
[2:07:06] he is lord over every sin
[2:07:08] he is lord over every habit it
[2:07:11] he's lord over every disease
[2:07:13] ever affliction he is lord
[2:07:20] now
[2:07:21] you see
[2:07:22] in all of the cases
[2:07:25] it was where they gave him preeminence
[2:07:29] that he reigned
[2:07:31] and when he reigned
[2:07:33] he reigned in omnipotence
[2:07:38] that's the way the holy ghost comes into
[2:07:40] you to reign in omnipotence
[2:07:42] in all power i am the almighty god
[2:07:48] you're going to take into you the life
[2:07:50] of all mighty god now this is of course
[2:07:55] particularly true
[2:07:57] in jesus christ where the fullness of
[2:07:59] god was made was made known because in
[2:08:02] christ the secret of the mystery of god
[2:08:04] the power of god in moses david or
[2:08:06] elijah was made known and manifested
[2:08:10] he was the christ the anointed man
[2:08:13] that was anointed with the fullness of
[2:08:15] the godhead
[2:08:17] bodily
[2:08:18] where moses partly had him and
[2:08:20] where that david had him and but in
[2:08:23] christ jesus he was manifested in the
[2:08:25] fullness
[2:08:26] deity standing on the earth
[2:08:29] god in his fullness to die for the sins
[2:08:31] of the people that he might bring to his
[2:08:34] church a sanctified life
[2:08:36] that he might have preeminence and
[2:08:38] fullness in his church to manifest every
[2:08:41] promise in these days that he promised
[2:08:43] for the last days
[2:08:45] so you see a people giving christ
[2:08:48] preeminence
[2:08:50] as i said he was the lord reigning in
[2:08:52] power through david
[2:08:55] when he reigned through samson
[2:08:58] when he reigned through sarah
[2:09:00] when he reigned to rebecca through ruth
[2:09:04] amen it's the holy spirit they're
[2:09:07] empowering
[2:09:10] it's the holy spirit living this is it's
[2:09:12] speaking out of these lives
[2:09:15] but in today you are the voice
[2:09:22] thousands of years ago abraham was the
[2:09:24] voice
[2:09:26] but now you are the voice
[2:09:31] you remember john standing there and he
[2:09:33] would say
[2:09:34] i am the voice of one crying in the
[2:09:36] wilderness
[2:09:38] now
[2:09:39] john was not the one crying in the
[2:09:41] wilderness you said brother them he was
[2:09:42] preaching in the wilderness he was not
[2:09:43] the one crying in the wilderness the one
[2:09:46] crying in the wilderness was jehovah god
[2:09:49] he was looking for a people
[2:09:51] somebody help me preach
[2:09:53] amen and he was the one that was crying
[2:09:56] out
[2:09:57] and john was his voice
[2:10:01] he said i'm the voice of this one crime
[2:10:06] do you know what we had in this day the
[2:10:08] lord descended from heaven with a shout
[2:10:10] what was that it was the shout
[2:10:14] let me tell you brother branham was not
[2:10:16] the shout he was the voice
[2:10:19] amen that carried that word
[2:10:22] he spoke what god said
[2:10:24] amen
[2:10:27] he was the voice of the one crying
[2:10:31] and he wasn't
[2:10:32] let me tell you this way he was in the
[2:10:34] wilderness he was not out there in
[2:10:36] denominations
[2:10:38] he was out there away from from any sect
[2:10:42] of man an idea man come on church
[2:10:45] and then he left all of that behind and
[2:10:47] he became the voice of that one crying
[2:10:50] in the wilderness
[2:10:52] a man of making a pathway for my god
[2:10:59] hallelujah now john did it 2000 years
[2:11:01] ago
[2:11:02] but brother branham told us his purpose
[2:11:04] and my mission is to forerun the coming
[2:11:07] word which is christ
[2:11:09] he said my job is to forerun
[2:11:12] amen the bride of jesus christ
[2:11:15] because christ is coming in this
[2:11:17] generation he is here today
[2:11:20] but he's not in the meeting in the air
[2:11:22] he's not in the man called jesus he's
[2:11:25] here in a bright body
[2:11:32] so the lord reigned in power
[2:11:34] through david samson
[2:11:37] sarah to rebecca to ruth
[2:11:41] when i was there
[2:11:43] this this prophecy just struck me
[2:11:46] it was a prophecy of danny henry
[2:11:50] that and i spoke on this in cloverdale
[2:11:54] where the holy spirit fell upon
[2:11:56] a young baptist boy
[2:11:58] who didn't know a word of french
[2:12:01] he'd never spoken in other tongues
[2:12:03] and the holy spirit is fell upon him
[2:12:07] it was february the 11th 1961
[2:12:11] and and brother
[2:12:12] brother
[2:12:14] brother branham you know tells about and
[2:12:16] gives the word of prophecy and we'll get
[2:12:19] to it in a moment
[2:12:21] and i i just
[2:12:22] sometimes you know you look at something
[2:12:24] like this
[2:12:25] and we view it as just history
[2:12:28] well that happened in 1961 that was that
[2:12:30] was a wonderful moment a wonderful time
[2:12:33] why can't it happen now
[2:12:38] hello
[2:12:40] if christ is still the same why can't it
[2:12:42] happen now
[2:12:46] amen i just want to say it can
[2:12:50] amen it can i i just i'm just going to
[2:12:52] read you a couple that were given
[2:12:54] personally to me here the other day
[2:12:56] brother adam would share what was given
[2:12:58] personally him let me give something
[2:12:59] personal to me
[2:13:01] as brother buzz bose he would write me
[2:13:03] he said just so you know your faith
[2:13:05] inspires thousands of believers around
[2:13:07] the world including us
[2:13:09] you've done so much damage to the
[2:13:10] kingdom of darkness through your
[2:13:12] ministry you're one of god's generals of
[2:13:14] our time that that the devil is so
[2:13:17] obsessed at trying to pull down to
[2:13:19] whatever way he thinks he can
[2:13:23] poor devil he can't
[2:13:25] we are the unstoppable bride
[2:13:28] and as he as he speaks this he begins to
[2:13:31] prophesy your sacrifice toward my sheep
[2:13:34] is what has moved me
[2:13:36] here you are yielding yourself like
[2:13:39] never before to face what you have never
[2:13:41] faced
[2:13:42] but i am the lord that keeps my promises
[2:13:45] i fail not i am the lord
[2:13:48] a series of victories is going to be
[2:13:50] it's meant to be for my name's glory
[2:13:54] only be thou of good cheer to not to not
[2:13:57] are the words of the wicked one no one
[2:13:59] can stand against me i speak and my
[2:14:02] words are light for i have done this
[2:14:04] saith the spirit of the lord

[2:14:14] ministry i'm raising a generation of
[2:14:17] young people
[2:14:18] you think about you young people you've
[2:14:20] been prophesied about
[2:14:22] a generation of young people that will
[2:14:24] stand with my word
[2:14:26] without fear or favor of man
[2:14:29] i believe we're raising that kind of
[2:14:31] crop
[2:14:32] of young people here today
[2:14:34] young men and young women that will not
[2:14:36] give boys to the world they will not
[2:14:38] give voice to hollywood they'll not give
[2:14:41] voice to the trendy ways of the world
[2:14:43] they will not get come somebody with me
[2:14:46] they will not give voice to a feminine
[2:14:48] spirit and sodom and gomorrah
[2:14:51] they're going to give voice to the word
[2:14:58] what's a person do when he puts on his
[2:15:00] clothes you know of uh
[2:15:02] of lsu his he has given voice that i am
[2:15:06] a fan of lsu i am a supporter of that
[2:15:10] team

[2:15:13] dress and the way you conduct yourself

[2:15:20] and there are millions out there giving
[2:15:21] voice what do you think this purple hair

[2:15:38] cutting themselves to giving voice
[2:15:41] to a spirit
[2:15:46] [Music]
[2:15:49] but i believe there's a be young people
[2:15:51] in this day that's going to give a voice
[2:15:52] to god
[2:15:54] they've got to they are a voice to the
[2:15:56] word of god

[2:16:02] hallelujah they are the interpretation
[2:16:04] they are the young they are the prophecy
[2:16:07] or shall i say they are the
[2:16:08] interpretation of the hebrew children
[2:16:11] who would not bend who would not bow who
[2:16:14] would not burn
[2:16:16] amen they are they they are the
[2:16:18] interpretation of daniel amen who would

[2:16:29] to the ages and it's now speaking out of
[2:16:32] their life

[2:16:35] showing through
[2:16:37] power over sin power over darkness power
[2:16:40] over the world

[2:16:46] he says
[2:16:47] i'm raised in a generations of young
[2:16:50] people that will stand with my word

[2:17:06] promises of my holy writ

[2:17:28] will make it good saith the lord
[2:17:33] hallelujah
[2:17:34] amen to me that's just as real as it was
[2:17:37] when danny henry spoke
[2:17:40] amen
[2:17:41] there at youth camp
[2:17:43] their brother andrew spencer turned to
[2:17:46] me
[2:17:47] there and spoke a word of prophecy over
[2:17:49] me
[2:17:50] saying i've seen you sitting at your
[2:17:52] computer i've seen you in your tears
[2:17:55] i've seen you in every moment i have
[2:17:58] blessed you when others mocked you i
[2:18:01] blessed you when others criticized you
[2:18:03] but i have blessed you to build my body
[2:18:06] by the word
[2:18:09] hallelujah
[2:18:10] amen what would he say to brother
[2:18:12] branham and i want you to realize it's
[2:18:14] more to brother branham when god gave a
[2:18:17] word to brother branham he was giving it
[2:18:19] to you
[2:18:22] because thou has chosen the narrow path
[2:18:26] the harder way
[2:18:27] thou has walked to thine own choosing
[2:18:30] thou has for to protect the correct and
[2:18:34] precise decision and it is my way
[2:18:38] because of this momentous decision a
[2:18:41] huge portion of heaven awaits thee
[2:18:44] this in itself is that which will give
[2:18:46] and make to come to pass their
[2:18:47] tremendous victory in the love divine
[2:18:51] i'm telling you this morning there is a
[2:18:53] tremendous victory in the love divine in
[2:18:56] the holy ghost
[2:18:58] hallelujah and we will have that victory
[2:19:00] because we chose the right path
[2:19:04] because we went the harder way because
[2:19:07] we chose the narrow path
[2:19:09] we could be compromising preachers we
[2:19:12] could be denominational men hanging up
[2:19:15] like a puppet on a string but god called
[2:19:18] us for a purpose and for a reason
[2:19:21] hallelujah and it's a harder way it's a
[2:19:24] harder path and it is never easy to have
[2:19:27] to call right right and wrong wrong
[2:19:33] amen it's never easy it's the narrow
[2:19:36] path it's the harder way
[2:19:38] amen but thou has walked to thine on
[2:19:41] jesus you see you have to choose
[2:19:45] you young people you have to choose you
[2:19:47] know cain had to choose to do the will
[2:19:49] of god and he refused to do it
[2:19:52] the choice was set before him don't you
[2:19:54] know if you do right you'll be accepted
[2:19:57] if you come the way your brother did of
[2:19:59] the lamb and repentance you'll be
[2:20:01] accepted too but he refused to do it
[2:20:05] he knew the perfect will of god and
[2:20:06] refused to do it
[2:20:08] and god will bring the very perfect will
[2:20:10] of god
[2:20:12] of how you're to live how you to conduct
[2:20:14] yourself the kind of believer that you
[2:20:16] are to be and you can look right at that
[2:20:19] and fail to do it
[2:20:24] now
[2:20:26] but you have to choose
[2:20:29] but i was chosen before the foundational
[2:20:31] world yeah that's predestination
[2:20:34] but god knew what choice she would make
[2:20:38] amen now he didn't predestinate you on
[2:20:40] the choice on what choice you would make
[2:20:43] he predestinated you in christ
[2:20:47] so it's in christ where we are
[2:20:48] predestinated in christ jesus
[2:20:52] right
[2:20:52] amen so we have been predestinated to
[2:20:55] adoption that's the holy ghost
[2:20:57] we have been predestinated to receive of
[2:20:59] the spirit
[2:21:01] amen but you have to choose
[2:21:05] there's still something you've got to do
[2:21:07] you see moses had to choose the right
[2:21:10] path
[2:21:12] he had to give voice will i keep giving
[2:21:14] voice to pharaoh and pharaoh's daughter
[2:21:17] and the kingdom of egypt well i i'm a
[2:21:20] young prince i've been given voice i
[2:21:22] dress like a prince i look like a prince
[2:21:24] i conduct myself as a prince i am
[2:21:26] representing the kingdom of egypt
[2:21:29] but one day he realized that voice did
[2:21:32] not fit
[2:21:35] the inner seed that was in him
[2:21:38] come on there's many of you you've tried
[2:21:40] this on and you tried that and you tried
[2:21:43] to fit in here and you tried to fit in
[2:21:44] there but it didn't fit
[2:21:48] and one day you made a choice
[2:21:51] and you made jesus your choice and you
[2:21:53] gave him preeminence and that's when
[2:21:56] that dividend started working in you
[2:21:59] cigarettes fell off and dope and
[2:22:00] pornography and sin and that drunkenness
[2:22:03] and everything began to fall off why you
[2:22:05] gave him
[2:22:06] preeminence
[2:22:08] you let him reign
[2:22:10] you made him your king
[2:22:14] now moses had his foot on the throne he
[2:22:16] could enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[2:22:19] season and let me say sin has pleasures
[2:22:25] it's fun
[2:22:29] you know you look at him
[2:22:31] the marlborough man
[2:22:34] out on a horse having fun lariat
[2:22:37] cigarette cowboy hat
[2:22:40] he's having his fun
[2:22:42] he's a man
[2:22:43] you don't see him sucking it through
[2:22:45] this right here
[2:22:47] trying to give up on that
[2:22:49] in cursing the very saying
[2:22:52] because sin only has a season of
[2:22:55] pleasure
[2:22:58] let me tell you the pleasure we have
[2:22:59] received there's no season on it
[2:23:07] there's no end to it
[2:23:09] it only gets better
[2:23:12] hallelujah i found this pleasure when i
[2:23:14] was a young boy i'm here now 67 years
[2:23:17] old and i still have this place and i
[2:23:19] say it's sweeter
[2:23:21] it's better i see the effects i see it
[2:23:24] in my children i see it my family i see
[2:23:26] it in my church i see it on people i
[2:23:28] influence it's sweet
[2:23:33] but i had to choose it

[2:23:40] baptist school teacher pulled me aside
[2:23:42] and said look son

[2:24:00] it out
[2:24:02] it would cultivate it make me it would
[2:24:05] make me what i would be
[2:24:07] but i had to choose a different path

[2:24:17] denomination have the biggest church

[2:24:51] of the talent

[2:31:23] now to receive your healing you're going
[2:31:25] to have to give the word preeminence
[2:31:27] over what the doctor says anybody else
[2:31:30] you're going to have to give the word
[2:31:31] premiums to receive the holy ghost
[2:31:32] you've got to give the word preeminence
[2:31:34] over everything else

[2:31:39] your life you've got to give him
[2:31:42] you got to say the lord
[2:31:45] omnipotent
[2:31:46] reign
[2:31:53] the lord omnipotent
[2:31:57] i want you to think of this
[2:32:00] as we come to close this morning
[2:32:03] brother timothy finds something to sing
[2:32:05] and when we worship the lord
[2:32:08] look at this
[2:32:10] verse 7 and chapter 19
[2:32:12] let us be glad and rejoice
[2:32:16] can't you rejoice this morning
[2:32:19] amen and give honor to him
[2:32:22] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[2:32:25] you see that can't happen without the
[2:32:27] woman
[2:32:28] giving him preeminence
[2:32:31] he must be the head
[2:32:34] his headship must be accepted
[2:32:37] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[2:32:39] and she's prepared herself
[2:32:44] she's made herself ready
[2:32:46] and he said unto me blessed are happy or
[2:32:49] they which are called to the marriage
[2:32:51] supper
[2:32:52] of the lamb you know every one of you
[2:32:54] that's received that have been called to
[2:32:57] the married supper
[2:32:58] of the lamb
[2:33:02] and then he said these
[2:33:04] are
[2:33:07] the true saiyans
[2:33:08] of god
[2:33:12] now of course i believe what he said is
[2:33:13] true sayings
[2:33:15] but i'm talking about
[2:33:18] the shadow
[2:33:21] versus
[2:33:22] the fulfillment
[2:33:24] the negative
[2:33:26] versus
[2:33:27] the positive
[2:33:30] oh my thought just for money
[2:33:33] so the shadow
[2:33:35] don't show it all
[2:33:37] my shadow my hand will not show its
[2:33:40] fingerprints
[2:33:43] i have to hold it just right in the
[2:33:45] light or it won't show all my fingers
[2:33:49] the shadow don't always project
[2:33:52] what's coming perfectly
[2:33:55] neither did abraham
[2:33:57] neither did any of them down to the ages
[2:34:03] but i just want to say this
[2:34:07] those that are called to the marriage
[2:34:09] supper
[2:34:12] you see those were
[2:34:14] the saiyans of god
[2:34:17] but right here
[2:34:19] is the true saiyans
[2:34:20] [Music]
[2:34:23] do you understand what i mean
[2:34:24] not a negative
[2:34:26] not a shadow
[2:34:28] but the positive the true
[2:34:31] versus the shadow
[2:34:33] because we're no longer typing another
[2:34:36] age to come
[2:34:37] we're the fulfillment of it
[2:34:41] hallelujah and now the true word what
[2:34:44] god had in his mind for a bride the true
[2:34:47] word
[2:34:48] of god is now manifested
[2:34:52] in bright form
[2:34:54] just like it was the true word
[2:34:56] manifested in groom form
[2:34:59] [Music]
[2:35:03] you're the true saiyans
[2:35:06] the true word
[2:35:12] why
[2:35:14] you chose the harder way
[2:35:17] like abraham you had to give the word
[2:35:19] preeminence
[2:35:21] oh
[2:35:22] oh that ishmael might live before you
[2:35:25] he had to give that preeminence
[2:35:28] this is my will bless his smell yeah you
[2:35:30] just you know that's just good enough
[2:35:33] he had to give that word preeminence
[2:35:36] sarah had to give the word preeminence
[2:35:41] you have to give the word preeminence
[2:35:44] that's what he wants in your life
[2:35:47] [Music]
[2:35:49] we ought to worship him this morning
[2:35:53] let's sing it to him
