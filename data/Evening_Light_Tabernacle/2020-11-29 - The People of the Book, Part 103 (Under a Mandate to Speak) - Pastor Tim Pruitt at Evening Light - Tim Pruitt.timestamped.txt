[19:07] brother ron
[19:09] spencer is he's still in the middle of a
[19:12] great battle of cancer and
[19:13] god's given him some great victories but
[19:16] we're looking for a complete
[19:17] victory amen we're thankful for everyone
[19:21] that he's had but
[19:22] we're looking for a complete total
[19:24] deliverance from this thing
[19:26] and i believe god's that kind of god
[19:29] also remember we have a couple of people
[19:32] today
[19:33] angel coleman and also christian
[19:35] middleton that somehow got into some
[19:37] poison ivy and very allergic to it

[19:51] ventilator
[19:53] doctors are really giving up on him he
[19:55] really needs a turn
[19:58] in the next few moments so we just ask
[20:00] the lord to be merciful on his behalf
[20:02] also his wife has covered they don't
[20:05] have any
[20:06] children so there's you know really no

[20:12] them today

[20:53] morning
[20:53] how many would have a need to make it
[20:55] known to the lord

[20:59] aaron ogles be if he'd come and open our
[21:01] service in prayer and take these needs
[21:03] before the lord today but let's just
[21:07] maybe you can't remember them all but
[21:08] maybe you can remember a few of them and
[21:10] just take them before the lord and
[21:12] just ask god to move in the mighty way
[21:16] and touch lives and touch hearts
[21:19] and god will just come in this healing
[21:21] power and deliver i
[21:23] i believe we're in that season of
[21:24] deliverance
[21:26] a season when god can pour out his
[21:29] spirit upon all flesh
[21:31] touch hearts and lives and change
[21:34] change situations in a moment i believe
[21:37] he's that kind of god so let's go to him

[45:13] holy spirit just
[45:14] putting the words in our mouth lord
[45:17] speaking out
[45:18] words of eternal life words that will
[45:21] break fetters
[45:22] and break chains of darkness and
[45:25] unbelief of our lives

[46:30] left about what we can't and cannot do
[46:33] but anyway we're here we're here to to
[46:35] glorify god
[46:36] and to celebrate the liberty that we
[46:39] have in christ
[46:41] amen so god bless you for coming being
[46:43] with us today
[46:44] verse 20 of the chapter 11 of mark
[46:48] and in the morning as they passed by
[46:49] they saw the fig tree
[46:51] dried up from the roots and
[46:54] peter calling to remembrance saith unto
[46:58] him
[46:58] master behold the fig tree which thou
[47:01] curseth
[47:02] is withered away and jesus
[47:05] answered him said unto them have faith
[47:08] in god for verily i say unto you that
[47:11] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[47:15] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[47:18] the sea
[47:19] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[47:21] shall believe that those things which he
[47:23] saith
[47:24] shall come to pass he shall have
[47:26] whatsoever he saith
[47:29] therefore i say unto you what things
[47:32] soever you desire when you pray
[47:35] believe that you receive them and you
[47:37] shall have them
[47:39] then i would like to go down to
[47:41] revelation chapter 10
[47:42] we'll read from verse 8 there this
[47:45] morning
[47:46] as we look into the precious word of god
[47:50] and its eternal truth
[47:52] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[47:55] spake unto me
[47:56] again and said go and take
[47:59] the little book which is open in the
[48:02] hand
[48:02] of the angel which standeth upon the sea
[48:05] and upon the earth
[48:07] and i went unto the angel and said unto
[48:09] him give me the little book
[48:11] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[48:14] up
[48:15] and it shall make thy belly bitter but
[48:17] it shall be in thy mouth
[48:20] sweet as honey and i took the little
[48:22] book out of the angel's hand and made it
[48:25] up
[48:25] and it was in my mouth sweetest honey
[48:28] and as soon as
[48:30] i had eaten it my belly was bitter and
[48:33] he said unto
[48:34] me thou must prophesy
[48:37] again before many peoples
[48:40] and tongue nations and tongues and kings
[48:44] and that's why we're speaking today on
[48:47] under a mandate
[48:49] to speak amen god bless you you can have
[48:52] your seats
[48:54] brother branham said something very
[48:56] striking that i
[48:58] thought was very noteworthy to mention
[49:01] this morning
[49:02] in the message perseverance he refers to
[49:05] the scripture that we have read
[49:07] if you say to this mountain be moved and
[49:10] don't doubt in your heart
[49:12] but believe that what you've said will
[49:14] come to pass you can have what you
[49:16] say and then he said now i've said it
[49:20] now let it be done it is written to be
[49:23] spoken i have spoke it
[49:26] let it be done and as we
[49:30] think of that uh those words to me
[49:33] are really profound it is written to be
[49:36] spoken it's not written just to collect
[49:39] in a book
[49:40] it's not recognized written just for you
[49:42] to memorize
[49:44] but it is written for to be spoken
[49:47] jesus gave us a mandate to speak that
[49:50] when he told us we should speak to this
[49:53] mountain
[49:55] and we as a church of course have
[49:58] journeyed a long ways from this
[49:59] scripture
[50:01] for the early church was birthed by the
[50:03] word
[50:04] they cast out devils by the word they
[50:06] healed the sick by the word
[50:09] they saved souls by the spoken word
[50:12] they were mountain moving believers
[50:15] who operated with full authority as sons
[50:18] of god
[50:19] standing on the brink from going from
[50:22] mortal to immortality
[50:25] they were literally born speaking
[50:28] the wonderful works of god in all
[50:31] languages
[50:32] these newborn believers were born
[50:35] speaking in other tongues or other
[50:38] languages
[50:40] and they were declaring the wonderful
[50:42] works of god they were not just
[50:45] modern um nonsense or phrases that are
[50:49] in unintelligible they were but they
[50:51] were actually declaring
[50:54] and and and speaking of the wonderful
[50:57] works of god
[50:59] and they were doing this in all
[51:01] languages now i
[51:02] you know i've kind of had this in my own
[51:06] in my heart and on my chest for some for
[51:09] some
[51:09] services and and and if i bring it up
[51:12] again
[51:13] or again or again i i just believe it's
[51:17] something the holy spirit is wanting to
[51:20] emphasize to us
[51:22] but um you know we we have been on a
[51:25] long journey
[51:27] since the day of pentecost and the
[51:30] church has went through
[51:32] seven ages as went as typed in the
[51:35] scripture by
[51:36] seven churches of asia
[51:39] and that there were seven uh angels to
[51:42] that
[51:42] to those churches and and of course
[51:46] each one of them receiving a portion
[51:49] of the anointing of that one spirit as
[51:52] seven spirits of god would
[51:54] come to anoint those messengers in their
[51:57] day
[51:57] and their time and yet in this
[52:00] journey we we know that it's been typed
[52:04] as jesus and his parents went up to the
[52:06] feast of passover
[52:08] and they left him there and then they
[52:10] went on a journey without him
[52:13] and so as the church in their journey
[52:15] they left him
[52:16] not not just at the passover even though
[52:18] we could go back
[52:19] now to the passover and pentecost and
[52:22] calvary and the day of pentecost
[52:25] and just say that in in the
[52:28] journey we we the church has left christ
[52:31] at
[52:32] pentecost and luke chapter 2 verse 44
[52:36] says but they supposing him
[52:39] to be among their company when a day's
[52:42] journey and they sought him
[52:44] among their kins folks and their and
[52:47] acquaintances and we have
[52:48] we went way more than a day's journey
[52:52] we went for now 2 000 years that the
[52:55] church has journeyed
[52:56] from the day of pentecost and i wonder
[52:59] today
[53:00] and and i don't want to be vindictive
[53:03] and
[53:03] and you know and even though some of my
[53:06] words may seem a bit harsh
[53:08] it is just to bring us to a recognition
[53:13] of our need of jesus that we
[53:17] need him more than ever and that he's
[53:20] missing today he is the missing element
[53:24] in most other religious circles today
[53:28] and and jesus yet he's the most
[53:31] important thing but but people are just
[53:34] supposing
[53:36] that jesus is somewhere in their
[53:38] churches
[53:39] and he's really not there at all his
[53:42] signs are not there
[53:43] his wonders are not there and finally
[53:46] his silence
[53:47] has become definite until they go
[53:50] looking for him among their kin folks
[53:54] the bible said they sought through him
[53:56] among their kindred and
[53:58] and you know we could ask of zusa street
[54:01] have you seen jesus
[54:02] no we we haven't seen him since we took
[54:05] tongues as
[54:06] our evidence and you know we still speak
[54:09] in tongues though but
[54:10] we can manufacture them anytime we want
[54:12] to but no
[54:13] we haven't seen jesus his signs his
[54:17] wonders his movement is not among us
[54:20] we ask the divine healing movement no
[54:24] he was once here he healed our sick and
[54:26] he
[54:27] opened the eyes of the blind and made
[54:29] the cripples walk but
[54:31] while we were arguing about who had the
[54:33] biggest tenth and the best
[54:35] magazine jesus went quietly away
[54:40] we we haven't seen him and and his
[54:43] miracles have ceased among us
[54:46] yes the method is now we we haven't seen
[54:49] him
[54:49] since the days of john wesley when they
[54:53] shouted and fell out in the spirit
[54:55] he was here then but we hadn't seen him
[54:58] in a long time
[54:59] you know where but we don't need him we
[55:02] have both the
[55:03] gays and women in the pulpit we have gay
[55:06] marriages and beautiful liturgy and
[55:08] beautiful formal religious worship
[55:12] so we have we have been so involved with
[55:15] that we haven't missed him
[55:17] you know we we hadn't noticed that he's
[55:20] not here
[55:21] you know brother branham saw this in a
[55:23] vision um
[55:24] when he saw the mountain of the great
[55:27] bread of life and he saw this
[55:29] great mountain before him and a door was
[55:32] opened into that mountain and he says he
[55:35] stepped in it
[55:36] he walked in through the door and was
[55:39] met
[55:39] by a woman who had a garment that might
[55:42] have been
[55:43] snow white at one time but now the
[55:45] garment was very spoiled
[55:47] and soiled and and she she asked
[55:50] this woman asked are you bill branham
[55:52] and he said i am so well i'm miss
[55:55] methodist
[55:56] and and he said well then i asked her
[55:59] why
[56:00] or why the spots on that lovely white
[56:03] garment
[56:04] and she replied i've been so busy
[56:08] and i said that's right your methodists
[56:11] have so many organizations and societies
[56:14] in your church
[56:15] that you have much time for the lord
[56:18] and then then again um he looked over to
[56:23] his left and he saw a small heap
[56:26] of smooth baked bread and there were
[56:28] white fowls that was standing near
[56:30] and they wouldn't eat much of it and the
[56:33] lord said to me do you know who
[56:35] do they know you know them and he said
[56:37] no that's your tabernacle
[56:39] and they won't eat the bread of life
[56:41] anymore
[56:43] you see you asked some of the message
[56:45] churches then have you seen jesus
[56:47] no we haven't even missed him
[56:50] we have been so caught up with following
[56:52] personality
[56:53] cults that we haven't noticed he isn't
[56:56] around
[56:57] today you see we you know
[57:00] we we um think we have the holy ghost
[57:04] without sensation so no we haven't seen
[57:07] him and we haven't heard him and we have
[57:09] not
[57:10] felt him you know ever it's been quite a
[57:13] while since we've seen a
[57:15] holy ghost move and anyway he's just a
[57:18] mystery that we preach
[57:20] and brother tabernacle how about you
[57:22] have you seen jesus
[57:24] and brother branham would say and answer
[57:26] that in
[57:27] god's chosen place of worship my friends
[57:30] i don't want to hurt your feelings
[57:32] but i'm responsible for a message and
[57:34] that messages
[57:35] come out of this mess and i ask you to
[57:38] come out and where am i going to take
[57:40] you to when i take you to the branham
[57:42] tabernacle
[57:43] it's as much fault as the rest of them
[57:46] but there's one place i can take you to
[57:49] where that you're safe and you're
[57:50] protected from
[57:51] death and that's in jesus christ god's
[57:55] place of worship and that's the place
[57:57] that i'm introducing you to
[57:59] tonight where god put his name where he
[58:02] promised
[58:02] he would meet every person that come in
[58:04] there he would worship with him and with
[58:07] and feast with him that's in christ not
[58:10] no church no tabernacle
[58:15] as sister collins saw in her dream
[58:19] and this has been this is told in
[58:21] services is the time
[58:24] but she had a dream that brother neville
[58:28] as the ministry was serving a wonderful
[58:31] meal in the church
[58:33] serving dinner in the church dinner's
[58:36] the evening meal
[58:38] and it was the best food she'd ever seen
[58:42] and she was hungry but she thought that
[58:44] he shouldn't serve it
[58:47] you see no one was to be allowed to
[58:50] preach but brother branham
[58:52] so they left and went to the wyatt to
[58:55] the ranch house and
[58:56] and when they you know when that kind of
[58:58] attitude came in and brought him a
[58:59] tabernacle
[59:01] the light went out on the right side and
[59:04] sadly the light is still out
[59:08] you listen to the warning that was given
[59:10] to them in a deceived church by the
[59:12] world
[59:12] and this this again is not vindictive of
[59:16] a of a certain church i'm talking about
[59:18] the message community
[59:20] in general because
[59:23] too often in our churches he is missing
[59:28] he is absent in the worship there's no
[59:32] joy in the church there's no shadow of
[59:34] the king
[59:35] everybody even his gifts that he would
[59:38] send is not welcome
[59:40] amen healings is almost non-existence
[59:44] and and preaching has been done against
[59:47] even the least of the gifts speaking in
[59:48] tongues and i don't know what you have
[59:50] to worry about
[59:51] most have never spoken tongues
[59:55] and brother badam said there to them in
[59:58] a deceived church by the world he said
[1:00:00] branham tabernacle
[1:00:01] worldliness is creeping upon you what
[1:00:04] about it have you exposed your secret
[1:00:06] have you exposed that secret that god
[1:00:09] gave you
[1:00:10] when you were wilder and there in the
[1:00:11] sawdust a few years ago have you let it
[1:00:14] creep out in formal worship
[1:00:17] what's happened to you god can come
[1:00:19] right down and perform a miracle
[1:00:21] and go right through the audience and
[1:00:23] tell people the secrets of their hearts
[1:00:25] and everything and heal the sick and
[1:00:27] afflict it and do signs and wonders
[1:00:29] and preach his word as hard as it can by
[1:00:32] the holy ghost
[1:00:33] and people say well i guess that was all
[1:00:35] right
[1:00:36] we enjoy listening to it once in a while
[1:00:38] if we're not too tired
[1:00:40] that's branham tabernacle the
[1:00:42] philistines is on thee
[1:00:45] when it used to be the preaching of the
[1:00:47] word
[1:00:48] and the old saints with the tears in
[1:00:50] their eyes
[1:00:51] would rise to the feed and walk sobbing
[1:00:54] maybe
[1:00:54] not saying a word just walking around
[1:00:56] two or three times and sat down
[1:00:58] so filled with the holy ghost the word
[1:01:01] fed them man shall not live by bread
[1:01:03] alone but by
[1:01:04] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:01:06] mouth of god the philistines is on the
[1:01:09] branham tabernacle philistines is on
[1:01:12] your pentecostal
[1:01:13] of course the philistine got the rest of
[1:01:15] you a long time ago
[1:01:16] when you organized yourself so tight
[1:01:19] nothing could come in unless you was a
[1:01:21] presbyterian baptist methodist catholic
[1:01:23] or something you wouldn't have nothing
[1:01:25] to do with the rest of them
[1:01:27] so revival in our day how can we have it
[1:01:30] when the regular revival
[1:01:32] giver is bound by the world
[1:01:35] god won't come in where the world is you
[1:01:37] just depend on that
[1:01:39] you associate with the world and that's
[1:01:41] all of it and then when you
[1:01:43] let the world creep in you go to acting
[1:01:45] like the world
[1:01:47] and then you're finished but when you
[1:01:49] cut loose ever
[1:01:50] fetter from the world and you come to
[1:01:53] god god will use you
[1:01:54] until you go to flirting again here's
[1:01:57] the only hope that i have this morning
[1:01:59] to wind up my message is this
[1:02:01] while samson was bound a new shock of
[1:02:05] hair grew out
[1:02:09] i'm glad that there's some kind of hope
[1:02:12] that we can look to that somebody in
[1:02:14] this age is going to find jesus
[1:02:17] that it won't be the neglected christ he
[1:02:20] will not be the one
[1:02:21] sitting with unwashed feet but he will
[1:02:24] be welcomed and honored and accepted
[1:02:27] in the house of god
[1:02:32] sadly on the the people on the journey
[1:02:35] they've never seen him let alone missed
[1:02:39] him
[1:02:41] and i had brother branham would say i
[1:02:43] feel sorry for the people today
[1:02:46] many thousands of people in this nation
[1:02:49] that's belong to dozens of different
[1:02:51] churches trying to find
[1:02:53] where jesus is they go down to one
[1:02:56] certain church they check there they go
[1:02:58] to another
[1:02:59] they check there they find out
[1:03:01] something's wrong they don't
[1:03:02] act like and believe like and worship
[1:03:04] like there's no sound
[1:03:06] of the king in the camp there's no joy
[1:03:11] and he says i might say this if there
[1:03:13] was one thing i find in the pentecostal
[1:03:15] people
[1:03:16] that makes me believe they're certainly
[1:03:17] outstanding christians
[1:03:19] it's not because they're speaking in
[1:03:21] tongues or they get
[1:03:22] the signs of divine healing it's the joy
[1:03:25] that they have
[1:03:27] they just have no embarrassment they
[1:03:29] just let their hair
[1:03:31] down their hair and start to rejoice
[1:03:33] because there's something
[1:03:34] they're not ashamed of and that makes me
[1:03:36] believe there's something
[1:03:38] outstanding about them they're not
[1:03:41] ashamed they just soon
[1:03:42] shout out there in the street as it
[1:03:44] would in the church
[1:03:45] and if a hundred people are there
[1:03:47] laughing at them they wouldn't stop a
[1:03:49] bit they'd continue on
[1:03:50] shouting joy find them on the mission
[1:03:54] field starved to death almost i've seen
[1:03:56] them with no shoes on their feet living
[1:03:58] over 30 cents a week preaching the
[1:04:00] gospel brother
[1:04:01] just as happy as you are coming to the
[1:04:04] church in the limousine they're happy
[1:04:06] for they found something that means more
[1:04:09] than creed denomination or church
[1:04:11] affiliation
[1:04:13] they found what it takes to bring joy
[1:04:16] and a christian should be happy
[1:04:20] we we were prayed for that our joys
[1:04:23] might be full that was jesus prayer you
[1:04:25] remember
[1:04:26] it's something about it that's real
[1:04:30] now if we lost that joy if we lost those
[1:04:32] things if we can't find them
[1:04:33] among our kindred we can't find them
[1:04:36] then there's one thing to do
[1:04:38] and let's go back to where we left him
[1:04:40] at
[1:04:42] amen and the church should go back to
[1:04:44] the beginning where they left him
[1:04:46] because
[1:04:46] that's exactly what mary and joseph did
[1:04:49] they left
[1:04:50] jesus at the feast of pentecost and
[1:04:52] that's where mary and joseph left jesus
[1:04:55] now let me say this with all due
[1:04:56] consideration respect
[1:04:58] that's where both catholic and
[1:05:00] protestants left jesus
[1:05:03] at the feast of pentecost and you can't
[1:05:06] find him
[1:05:06] searching around here through creeds and
[1:05:09] denominations
[1:05:11] the denomination and creates all should
[1:05:13] go back
[1:05:14] to the beginning amen that's where the
[1:05:18] church will find him again
[1:05:20] you go back to the feast of pentecost
[1:05:23] you go back to the pouring out of the
[1:05:25] holy ghost
[1:05:26] and there you'll find the power of
[1:05:28] almighty god and you'll find a risen
[1:05:31] christ you'll
[1:05:32] you'll find signs and wonders of him
[1:05:34] just
[1:05:35] exactly like he said he would be amen
[1:05:38] you've got to go back to where you
[1:05:40] left him out go back to the beginning
[1:05:47] that's why there needs to be a return to
[1:05:50] a real upper room experience
[1:05:53] where men and women stagger under the
[1:05:56] influence
[1:05:56] of new wine why they ain't enough grapes
[1:06:00] or fruit on the vine to maybe
[1:06:02] to even make new wine today
[1:06:06] amen this is the deal jesus said
[1:06:09] very clearly in john 15 he said you are
[1:06:12] the
[1:06:12] i'm the vine you are the branches and
[1:06:15] the branch comes
[1:06:16] out of the vine and they wrote a book of
[1:06:18] acts behind it
[1:06:20] amen they had power to heal the sick
[1:06:23] they spoke with tongues
[1:06:24] they interpreted they had visions they
[1:06:27] had prophets
[1:06:28] power they'd done great signs that jesus
[1:06:31] did
[1:06:32] and if the first branch come out of that
[1:06:35] vine
[1:06:36] was that kind of a branch the next
[1:06:38] branch that comes out it'll bear the
[1:06:40] same kind of fruit
[1:06:42] amen because every branch it bears will
[1:06:45] be
[1:06:45] the same branch hallelujah they receive
[1:06:49] energy from the root
[1:06:52] amen i say let the root of david spring
[1:06:55] forth amen let that branch
[1:06:59] bring forth a man to produce the same
[1:07:02] fruits
[1:07:03] on the vine that the early church did
[1:07:10] because if we're going to be the branch
[1:07:12] that came out of the vine we had to bear
[1:07:14] a record of that branch
[1:07:16] amen the first branch came forth was a
[1:07:20] pentecostal branch
[1:07:22] amend the people and i'm i'm just going
[1:07:24] to quote this
[1:07:25] from brother branham he said that first
[1:07:27] branch that came forth was a pentecostal
[1:07:29] branch
[1:07:30] filled with the pentecostal power
[1:07:33] so impacted by the holy spirit until
[1:07:35] they staggered under the
[1:07:37] impact of the power of god that went
[1:07:39] forth and they saw
[1:07:40] visions performed and fought
[1:07:44] performed miracles and opened the eyes
[1:07:46] of the blind
[1:07:47] heal the sick joy was in the camp they
[1:07:50] prayed with one accord
[1:07:52] and all of them assembled are together
[1:07:54] until
[1:07:55] the building shook where they assembled
[1:07:57] together show me a church
[1:07:59] doing that today even the pentecost was
[1:08:02] so called is getting so dry
[1:08:04] while you have a little ceremonial
[1:08:06] prayer i wonder what he'd say about
[1:08:08] message churches today
[1:08:10] what an indictment would we get he said
[1:08:12] what we need is a prayer meeting
[1:08:15] that'll shake the shingles off the top
[1:08:17] of the house and bring
[1:08:18] god back in the church again amen oh my
[1:08:22] church that's exactly what it was it was
[1:08:24] a church filled with the spirit
[1:08:27] they healed the sick they prophesied
[1:08:29] they did great signs and wonders
[1:08:31] that wasn't ashamed of their religion
[1:08:34] amanda shouted and danced unto the
[1:08:36] spirit
[1:08:37] like drunk men amen and clothing tongues
[1:08:41] of fire
[1:08:42] sat down upon them and they began to
[1:08:44] speak in other languages
[1:08:46] the bible said all languages under
[1:08:49] heaven
[1:08:49] declaring the wondrous works of god
[1:08:53] amen it's about time the church again
[1:08:57] amen declares and speaks again to every
[1:08:59] nation
[1:09:00] to every kindred to all every tongue
[1:09:02] declaring
[1:09:03] the wonderful works of god that he's the
[1:09:06] same yesterday today or
[1:09:08] ever that he's still alive among us that
[1:09:10] he still
[1:09:11] heals us sick he casts out devils he
[1:09:14] still dwells upon his people
[1:09:19] hallelujah they've done signs and
[1:09:22] exploits they man they were there was
[1:09:26] that kind of a church at the beginning
[1:09:28] and that was the kind that they were in
[1:09:30] the middle that's the kind they're going
[1:09:31] to be in the end amen
[1:09:34] oh yeah but you know again
[1:09:38] today that kind of god is missing
[1:09:42] that kind of message that produces that
[1:09:44] kind of results
[1:09:46] is missing in too many churches
[1:09:50] dead churches with dead preachers
[1:09:54] given for dead sermons and these dead
[1:09:58] sermons
[1:10:00] kill
[1:10:02] amen now
[1:10:06] so where is the church been from
[1:10:09] for the past seven ages they've been on
[1:10:12] a journey
[1:10:14] to get back to jesus
[1:10:17] and to get back to jesus it would take
[1:10:20] malachite forward to turn us back to the
[1:10:22] faith of the fathers
[1:10:25] amen now we know that we left
[1:10:28] as a church as a church we're not
[1:10:30] talking about evening life here we're
[1:10:32] talking about
[1:10:32] a church all christianum it left
[1:10:35] jesus at pentecost
[1:10:39] and we know now we are living in the
[1:10:41] last age
[1:10:43] and if this age doesn't get back to
[1:10:45] jesus
[1:10:47] ain't nobody gonna get back to jesus
[1:10:50] because we're the last
[1:10:51] runners we're the last ones of the race
[1:10:55] and there must be a people get back to
[1:10:57] jesus
[1:10:58] again get back to the real spirit of god
[1:11:01] and the power of god not just in the
[1:11:03] pulpit but in the pew
[1:11:05] power that is in prayer power that is in
[1:11:08] men and women's voices
[1:11:10] declaring the wonderful works of god
[1:11:13] where the manifestation of the holy
[1:11:15] spirit flows through them
[1:11:18] laodicea was is to be i'm quoting this
[1:11:22] from the church's book
[1:11:24] laodicean is to be the age in which the
[1:11:27] true church
[1:11:28] would return to being the bride she was
[1:11:30] at pentecost
[1:11:32] to do this we know there must be of
[1:11:35] necessity be a return
[1:11:37] of dynamic power now
[1:11:40] if you haven't if you haven't returned
[1:11:44] to continuing the book of acts
[1:11:47] if the dynamic power is not there
[1:11:50] you're still on the journey and you
[1:11:53] haven't found him yet
[1:11:55] again quoting from the church age book
[1:11:58] which he
[1:11:58] references this scripture the spirit and
[1:12:01] the bride say come
[1:12:03] once more the world will hear direct
[1:12:06] from god
[1:12:06] as at pentecost at pentecost
[1:12:10] men with us filled with the spirit spoke
[1:12:15] as the spirit gave them utterance i want
[1:12:17] you to notice
[1:12:18] it was not men saying whatever they
[1:12:20] desire but the
[1:12:22] spirit was giving them utterance
[1:12:25] amen it repeats in the last day when the
[1:12:28] spirit
[1:12:28] comes down with the open book
[1:12:32] and as he does the silence is broken
[1:12:35] amen and the mysteries are revealed and
[1:12:38] as the people receive it
[1:12:40] and eats it up and digests it that they
[1:12:42] will do like they did at pentecost
[1:12:45] they'll be so filled with the spirit
[1:12:47] until they will
[1:12:48] prophesy again amen
[1:12:51] amen that's the spirit gives the
[1:12:53] mutterings out of every tongue and tribe
[1:12:57] and nation and people to all the world
[1:13:01] this is a mandate to speak
[1:13:04] thou must prophesy again
[1:13:10] in the fifth seal brother branham said
[1:13:13] this
[1:13:14] and you know i'm linking this with
[1:13:17] moving the mountain spoken word
[1:13:20] third paul the fifth seal brother
[1:13:23] branham said i i believe i'm not gonna
[1:13:25] say it and speak it in his name i'm
[1:13:27] gonna speak it
[1:13:28] in the revelation of my faith
[1:13:31] what happened in sabino canyon the other
[1:13:34] day
[1:13:35] you know what that was was a sword that
[1:13:38] was the word coming to a prophet
[1:13:40] amen here again i believe
[1:13:43] that the hour is approaching when
[1:13:46] missing limbs will be restored
[1:13:49] and the glorious power of the creator i
[1:13:51] believe if he can
[1:13:53] make a squirrel appear that has no and
[1:13:56] and here is a man or woman just a part
[1:13:58] missing and not a complete
[1:14:00] animal itself oh he's god i love him
[1:14:05] now the prophet isaiah he screamed out
[1:14:09] in isaiah 53 and 1 who hath believed our
[1:14:13] report
[1:14:15] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[1:14:17] revealed
[1:14:19] now this may seem to be a strange
[1:14:21] connection
[1:14:22] with uh with these other scriptures that
[1:14:24] i'm bringing but i want you to think of
[1:14:26] it
[1:14:26] like this god is the spirit and as a
[1:14:30] spirit he has no
[1:14:31] arm amen in revelation it depicts
[1:14:35] his sword being in his mouth so it is
[1:14:38] the word
[1:14:39] of god that is in that the arm of god
[1:14:43] comes forth in power
[1:14:44] and works through words amen he comes
[1:14:48] out of god's mouth
[1:14:50] his word is his arm his word would
[1:14:54] become
[1:14:54] flesh in jesus who would be god's arm of
[1:14:57] salvation
[1:14:58] [Music]
[1:15:00] and it would be the spoken word the
[1:15:02] original seed
[1:15:03] the word may flesh and dwelt among us
[1:15:06] by the word the worlds were framed
[1:15:09] together by the word of god
[1:15:11] not with the sweat of the brow that was
[1:15:13] spoken from from his mouth but adam
[1:15:16] dominated and controlled the earth he
[1:15:18] dressed the garden
[1:15:20] and by the gods powerful arm of the word
[1:15:24] amen and moses did the same by that
[1:15:27] powerful arm of the word coming out of
[1:15:30] the prophet's mouth
[1:15:31] amen it brought mighty egypt to her
[1:15:34] knees
[1:15:36] i want you to know it was because a man
[1:15:39] under the blood speaking
[1:15:41] are you with me amen it was adam
[1:15:45] you know before sin a sinless man before
[1:15:48] sin entered the picture
[1:15:50] that was authorized to use the word to
[1:15:53] bring
[1:15:54] dominion upon the earth by that word he
[1:15:57] he moved mountains he he uh he could
[1:16:00] move and
[1:16:00] as trees he could dress the garden any
[1:16:03] way that he wanted to
[1:16:05] by the word he'll be in harmony with
[1:16:09] god's
[1:16:09] word and god's plan are you with me
[1:16:14] now but isaiah
[1:16:18] is looking for somebody
[1:16:21] to believe i want to say that again
[1:16:25] isaiah is saying who hath believed our
[1:16:28] report
[1:16:29] he is saying who is it that believes
[1:16:35] amen who has believed i report
[1:16:38] for the arm of the lord can only be
[1:16:40] revealed
[1:16:42] to those who believe so until the bride
[1:16:46] returns back to the word in faith again
[1:16:49] the arm of the lord cannot be revealed
[1:16:51] in his power
[1:16:53] no matter how great the word is and how
[1:16:56] dynamic it is and how power-packed it is
[1:16:59] it must have faith to operate that word
[1:17:02] [Applause]
[1:17:04] there has to be a connection
[1:17:07] now so isaiah was looking for
[1:17:10] somebody who has believed i report
[1:17:14] i'm looking for someone to believe the
[1:17:17] report
[1:17:18] if i can get somebody to believe the
[1:17:20] report
[1:17:22] then to them the arm of the lord will be
[1:17:24] revealed
[1:17:25] all right now jesus spoke
[1:17:28] these words to martha now we'll go to
[1:17:31] jesus who was the arm of the lord on
[1:17:34] display on the earth
[1:17:36] remember again we're speaking about the
[1:17:39] mandate to speak
[1:17:41] and it's going to be demonstrated now
[1:17:43] through the word himself
[1:17:45] and john in john 11 40 jesus says his
[1:17:49] word to martha
[1:17:50] he said said i not unto thee that thou
[1:17:53] that if thou
[1:17:54] wouldest believe thou should have see
[1:17:56] the glory of god
[1:17:59] again the glory of god being seen
[1:18:04] there is a requirement of somebody
[1:18:06] finding
[1:18:07] somebody that will believe it
[1:18:12] now again it doesn't matter how
[1:18:16] how the word is restored in its purity
[1:18:19] and in its fullness if god can't get
[1:18:23] somebody to believe come on
[1:18:26] amen then the word will never be of any
[1:18:29] benefit
[1:18:30] it's like gasoline stored in a cab it's
[1:18:33] got all the acting and all the power
[1:18:35] but it has no dynamic to set it a fire
[1:18:39] the power is in the word but it takes
[1:18:42] the faith
[1:18:43] the spark of faith to cause it to come
[1:18:46] forth
[1:18:47] somebody in this age has got to start
[1:18:49] believing
[1:18:52] jesus pondered and wondered as he looked
[1:18:55] forward into this age and he said
[1:18:56] i wonder when the son of man cometh
[1:19:00] will i find church members
[1:19:05] well i find great deep theologians
[1:19:09] will there be all great mysteries and
[1:19:12] and and great teachings going on of
[1:19:15] these mysteries
[1:19:17] will i find faith will i find
[1:19:21] somebody to believe the report
[1:19:25] because only where the people starts
[1:19:27] believing
[1:19:29] come on now church that's why we got to
[1:19:31] wake jesus in our midst
[1:19:33] because we got to start believing again
[1:19:36] there's got to be a people return to
[1:19:39] faith
[1:19:39] and have an expectancy that he is the
[1:19:42] resurrection and the life
[1:19:48] jesus said in john 11 40
[1:19:51] if thou wouldest believe didn't i say to
[1:19:54] you if thou would as believe
[1:19:56] thy should have see the glory of god
[1:19:59] once again to see god's glory displayed
[1:20:02] somebody's got to believe
[1:20:06] i hear brother branham describe martha
[1:20:09] in the sermon uncertain sound and he
[1:20:12] said first thing you know little old
[1:20:13] martha come running out there and said
[1:20:15] lord oh i like that and if she she
[1:20:18] titled him what he was
[1:20:20] and when he was her lord if that would
[1:20:24] have been here my brother would not have
[1:20:25] died
[1:20:26] see but even now whatever you ask god
[1:20:29] god will give it to you
[1:20:31] there was nothing uncertain about it
[1:20:34] amen and then and i want you to get a
[1:20:37] point here and we'll elaborate it on in
[1:20:39] a minute
[1:20:40] but no matter how much jesus had the
[1:20:42] vision
[1:20:44] no matter how much he had the word
[1:20:47] come on no matter how much he wants the
[1:20:50] word
[1:20:51] somebody had to believe to see the glory
[1:20:54] of god
[1:20:55] amen that's where the church must return
[1:20:58] back to the word
[1:21:00] in faith and that way she will see the
[1:21:03] dynamic power of god somebody's got to
[1:21:06] start expecting god
[1:21:07] to move again to heal our sin to repulse
[1:21:11] cancer
[1:21:13] to stop coping in his track
[1:21:18] amen your name your disease your name
[1:21:20] your affliction your name to sin
[1:21:23] amen somebody's got to start believing
[1:21:26] again
[1:21:26] there's got to be an expectancy
[1:21:31] and with that expectancy comes a joy
[1:21:34] because when you expect him to move
[1:21:36] there's a joy in your heart saying i
[1:21:38] know you're going to do something
[1:21:40] whatever you ask god god's going to do
[1:21:42] it
[1:21:43] we're going to see the spirit move we're
[1:21:46] going to see
[1:21:46] the holy ghost out we're going to see
[1:21:49] the dynamics come to the mechanic
[1:21:51] and make that word live
[1:21:58] brother branham said that's where two
[1:22:00] positives meet
[1:22:04] that when that's when true omnipotence
[1:22:06] meets
[1:22:08] when one omnipotence she had she had
[1:22:10] omnipotent
[1:22:11] faith in christ what did she say
[1:22:15] whatever you ask god it's
[1:22:18] unlimited it's unlimited jesus it's
[1:22:22] unlimited
[1:22:24] she's confessing it before she even sees
[1:22:27] her brother raised from the dead
[1:22:28] she's confessing whatever you ask god
[1:22:33] he will do it amen she had
[1:22:36] omnipotent faith
[1:22:40] in an omnipotent christ
[1:22:44] we got an omnipotent christ right here
[1:22:46] it's the word
[1:22:48] come on amen she had omnipotent faith
[1:22:53] in christ and christ was omnipotency she
[1:22:55] had perfect
[1:22:56] omnipotent faith in our infinite faith
[1:22:59] in
[1:23:00] christ that he was the lord
[1:23:04] and knew whatever he asked god god would
[1:23:08] give it to him
[1:23:09] in other words she said you just speak
[1:23:12] the word
[1:23:13] that's all you have to do whatever
[1:23:17] you ask god god will give it
[1:23:20] all to you you don't speak it
[1:23:24] amen oh that the holy spirit would speak
[1:23:28] we've seen enough of man speaking
[1:23:32] come on we've seen enough of the bumbles
[1:23:34] of man
[1:23:35] and the fallacy of man but oh that men
[1:23:38] and women could come again
[1:23:39] moved by the holy ghost
[1:23:45] now that uh that's
[1:23:48] omnipotence all powerful because he just
[1:23:51] said so
[1:23:52] and he was all-powerful that's when two
[1:23:55] powers two omnipotent powers
[1:23:57] meets together it's a contact then
[1:24:00] notice a connection i want you to get to
[1:24:04] stop
[1:24:04] a connection a contact a connection
[1:24:08] when a line has got here 150 volts and
[1:24:11] this has 150 volts and when they come
[1:24:13] together you got a
[1:24:14] 150 votes both ways and when you get
[1:24:17] supreme power
[1:24:18] when jesus said lay hands on the sick
[1:24:20] they shall recover
[1:24:22] and you've got supreme faith and that
[1:24:24] being this
[1:24:25] the truth you need a supreme god that
[1:24:28] made a supreme promise
[1:24:29] and a supreme result will come amen
[1:24:34] now brother branham told us that as he
[1:24:37] pondered this scripture about
[1:24:40] speaking if you say not if i say
[1:24:44] but if you say to this mountain and he
[1:24:47] said he
[1:24:47] he began to wonder you know and ponder
[1:24:50] well perhaps
[1:24:51] you know that was not in the atonement
[1:24:53] this was before the atonement was even
[1:24:55] done
[1:24:55] and you know so jesus said these words
[1:24:59] and
[1:24:59] now after the atonement maybe it's not
[1:25:02] affected
[1:25:04] and the holy spirit dropped down and
[1:25:07] said to him
[1:25:08] but that's in the atonement
[1:25:12] i want you to know this the power of the
[1:25:14] spoken word
[1:25:16] is not something new or added
[1:25:20] or just for william brannon's ministry
[1:25:24] amen amen but it was in the atonement
[1:25:29] it's for everyone in the covenant under
[1:25:33] the blood
[1:25:35] are you with me amen that's in the
[1:25:37] atonement for a man
[1:25:39] or if a man or a woman is so consecrated
[1:25:43] and surrendered to god
[1:25:46] that god just moves in and uses their
[1:25:49] voice
[1:25:51] and it isn't the man speaking it's god's
[1:25:54] that's
[1:25:55] in him speaking
[1:25:58] hallelujah because only deity could move
[1:26:00] a mountain so it'd have to be god in the
[1:26:02] man speaking through the man
[1:26:05] there not a human over here blabbering
[1:26:08] and going on and trying to work up
[1:26:10] something but
[1:26:11] the holy spirit work in preeminence
[1:26:15] with preeminence in a people till he has
[1:26:18] control of their tongue
[1:26:20] like he did on the day of pentecost and
[1:26:22] they
[1:26:23] and the spirit gave them utterance
[1:26:32] are you ready to become a surrendered
[1:26:34] person
[1:26:36] amen so surrendered and
[1:26:40] and consecrated to god that god moves in
[1:26:43] and uses their voice and it isn't the
[1:26:46] man speaking
[1:26:48] it's god that's speaking in him and he
[1:26:51] said oh i thought that's right
[1:26:53] i'm gonna just say oh that we could be a
[1:26:56] people
[1:26:57] that the holy ghost could speak through
[1:27:01] he's gonna have a voice
[1:27:04] amen there's a voice of god the spirit
[1:27:06] and the bride
[1:27:07] say the bride is saying something
[1:27:12] come on church she is saying something
[1:27:16] amen there is a utterance coming out of
[1:27:18] her mouth she is saying
[1:27:20] something the bride says something
[1:27:25] amen revelation revelation 10 and 8
[1:27:28] shows
[1:27:29] the bride is saying something she
[1:27:32] prophesies
[1:27:34] she utters under inspiration
[1:27:37] she's speaking under an anointing
[1:27:41] hallelujah and a mighty angel has come
[1:27:44] down
[1:27:45] and an anointing has come down it
[1:27:48] anointed a prophet
[1:27:49] it loosed the seals it broke the silence
[1:27:52] it opened the book somebody helped me
[1:27:54] preach now
[1:27:56] amen but it did more than that it
[1:27:58] empowers a people
[1:27:59] to speak of people
[1:28:02] under the anointing
[1:28:04] [Applause]
[1:28:07] not a people void of the anointing not
[1:28:10] ministry that is dry and just a
[1:28:13] theological
[1:28:15] exposition but the word going forth in
[1:28:18] power
[1:28:19] the gospel preached not taught but
[1:28:21] preached and when it's preached
[1:28:23] signs follow them that believe
[1:28:30] i suggest you you pick a different
[1:28:32] sermon to go to sleep on this morning
[1:28:34] amen the spirit of god's trying to
[1:28:36] awaken you
[1:28:38] yes sir and he said something said to me
[1:28:41] what do you think
[1:28:43] how do you see those visions and things
[1:28:45] on the platform
[1:28:46] how do you see those visions out there
[1:28:48] what is it you think it's your own
[1:28:50] wisdom
[1:28:51] that you could predict something that
[1:28:52] would happen every time to the letter
[1:28:54] do you think that's you speaking no
[1:28:57] that's why he said
[1:28:58] you know that wasn't me speaking that
[1:29:00] was him using my voice
[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:03] and when he's speaking that i'm the
[1:29:05] voice of god to you
[1:29:09] amen now
[1:29:12] brother branham explains it this way he
[1:29:14] said well
[1:29:15] you know the the spirit is now speaking
[1:29:17] to him about his question about the
[1:29:19] scripture
[1:29:20] mark 16 or our
[1:29:23] 11 24 and and here he's he is
[1:29:27] he's been he's questioned god and said
[1:29:30] well you know
[1:29:31] i i never understood that maybe it's
[1:29:33] just before the atonement and god comes
[1:29:35] down and corrects his thinking
[1:29:36] no it's in the atonement and he said
[1:29:40] it's no different to when you speak unto
[1:29:41] the anointing
[1:29:44] and there you begin to tell people their
[1:29:46] name their address whether
[1:29:47] you think that's you speaking that's me
[1:29:49] speaking through you
[1:29:54] and and and again it was the spirit
[1:29:58] giving him utterance
[1:30:03] somebody with me amen now
[1:30:06] so again you know he said you've got
[1:30:09] yourself
[1:30:09] so completely surrendered to god he
[1:30:12] explains this
[1:30:13] in this um in this fellowship through uh
[1:30:16] reconciliation of the blood
[1:30:18] he said someone with thousands of times
[1:30:20] said thousands of times brother branham
[1:30:22] what does it mean when you feel your own
[1:30:25] life move away from you
[1:30:28] and something sets in and takes its
[1:30:30] place
[1:30:31] he said why it's a fellowship
[1:30:34] it's marvelous you know that you're not
[1:30:38] yourself
[1:30:39] no more you got yourself
[1:30:42] completely surrendered to god
[1:30:45] and it's not you talking it's him
[1:30:47] talking it's not you
[1:30:49] doing anything you're so happy to know
[1:30:51] he's doing it
[1:30:53] and it's such a love about it till you
[1:30:55] can hardly contain your joy
[1:30:57] hardly and to to know that god is doing
[1:31:00] something for the people
[1:31:04] now you think that that is for
[1:31:07] the prophet alone
[1:31:11] but i want you to look in matthew 10 and
[1:31:13] 19
[1:31:14] for when they deliver you up take no
[1:31:16] thought about what you shall speak
[1:31:20] for it shall be given you in that same
[1:31:22] hour what you shall speak
[1:31:24] you're going to speak but it's going to
[1:31:26] be given to you
[1:31:28] amen for it is not ye that speak
[1:31:32] but the spirit of your father that
[1:31:34] speaketh
[1:31:35] in you
[1:31:38] hallelujah i i'm preaching something
[1:31:41] that's a possibility to ever say
[1:31:46] amen for the spirit of god to speak
[1:31:49] to speak through individuals
[1:31:52] hallelujah and even brother brad i'm in
[1:31:55] the token he said you create such an
[1:31:57] atmosphere that when you speak to your
[1:32:00] son or your daughter that wayward child
[1:32:02] that they'll just they'll just fall
[1:32:04] right into it
[1:32:06] why because it isn't you speaking it is
[1:32:09] the father speaking through you
[1:32:13] amen a man or woman surrendered to god
[1:32:17] listen in my new ministry we'll pick it
[1:32:19] up again
[1:32:20] he said what would you think sometimes
[1:32:22] the holy spirit gets in a message
[1:32:25] and you don't know what to say what is
[1:32:27] it speaking then
[1:32:29] what is it when a man will speak in
[1:32:31] tongues he doesn't know nothing about it
[1:32:34] what is it when the one one will
[1:32:36] interpret that same tongue
[1:32:38] neither of them knowing anything about
[1:32:40] it it's the individual or it's
[1:32:42] or is it the individual or is it the
[1:32:44] spirit of the living god
[1:32:47] and that was the holy spirit speaking to
[1:32:49] them he said the holy spirit
[1:32:51] telling brother branham the holy spirit
[1:32:53] takes preachers over
[1:32:55] unto the point that he will speak
[1:32:59] and dawned and don't even know what to
[1:33:01] say but the holy spirit will actually
[1:33:03] utter through him
[1:33:07] this happened brother joe hadn't it that
[1:33:09] happened brother timothy hadn't happened
[1:33:11] by there
[1:33:11] that's what we call the anointing
[1:33:15] amen the anointing comes down and we say
[1:33:18] things that we never thought of saying
[1:33:20] we never even understood before he just
[1:33:22] flows right out
[1:33:24] amen what is it he said when one was
[1:33:27] speaking tongues in a language he knows
[1:33:29] nothing about another will interpret
[1:33:30] that same language
[1:33:32] amen he said the spirit of god speaking
[1:33:35] brother brighter now
[1:33:36] is it the individual or is it the spirit
[1:33:38] of the living god and he said
[1:33:40] that's true it's god that's speaking
[1:33:44] and all the church needs
[1:33:47] i'll finish this next week
[1:33:53] amen all the church
[1:33:57] needs do you want to know what we need
[1:33:59] to do this
[1:34:01] amen he is a step closer to him
[1:34:05] of a more consecrated life to live with
[1:34:08] him
[1:34:12] that's what brother bradham said we are
[1:34:14] standing under the blood of jesus christ
[1:34:17] and that blood has not only cleansed our
[1:34:19] sins it's taken the seals off the book
[1:34:22] it was done by bloody lamb by the work
[1:34:24] of an intercessor
[1:34:28] and he said we're standing under that
[1:34:30] blood under a complete atonement
[1:34:33] and he said that gives us that empowers
[1:34:36] us to speak
[1:34:40] speak words of creation
[1:34:44] now notice this patma's vision
[1:34:49] he said amen cut every obstacle from
[1:34:51] human beings
[1:34:52] that they might be connected what's this
[1:34:55] word again
[1:34:56] connected like in the garden of eden now
[1:34:59] man i was going to choke it but i'm
[1:35:01] going to say it man is omnipotent you
[1:35:04] don't believe that but he is a man fully
[1:35:06] surrendered to god is omnipotent
[1:35:10] did not he say in mark 11 22 whatsoever
[1:35:13] things you say
[1:35:14] and don't doubt in your heart it'll come
[1:35:16] to pass
[1:35:17] you can have what you said
[1:35:21] what happens when two omnipotents meet
[1:35:24] when god and man comes together to amen
[1:35:27] omnipotence something's got to shake
[1:35:30] amen whatever you say with that creative
[1:35:33] power the omnipotence of god knowing he
[1:35:35] promised it
[1:35:36] and he said in his word it creates a
[1:35:38] power that goes out yonder and brings
[1:35:40] things to pass
[1:35:41] things that is not it makes them as
[1:35:43] though they are because
[1:35:45] two omnipotents have met
[1:35:50] amen here again brother bradham is
[1:35:53] showing you
[1:35:53] an example there with with with
[1:35:57] martha and he shows their martha
[1:36:00] her faith omnipotent faith in an
[1:36:02] omnipotent god
[1:36:03] connected together and when it did it
[1:36:07] calls the creative power
[1:36:09] of omnipotence to go out and a man that
[1:36:13] was dead in the grave four days
[1:36:15] rose again hallelujah
[1:36:19] because faith was connected with
[1:36:22] omnipotence the omnipotent word
[1:36:25] amen and the omnipotent faith of a
[1:36:28] starter of god
[1:36:30] brought the truth together and when the
[1:36:32] connection was made
[1:36:33] that dead was raised
[1:36:37] oh that the people's faith would be
[1:36:40] connected with the promise today
[1:36:42] come on amen if you remember the story
[1:36:45] of lazarus
[1:36:47] and saint john's gospel let's just
[1:36:48] deviate for a moment let's just
[1:36:50] discover this a little bit about martha
[1:36:53] there there there for two days
[1:36:57] jesus had lingered beyond jordan
[1:37:00] he was urgently needed they're back at
[1:37:03] bethany
[1:37:04] where were lazarus was dying he was
[1:37:07] fading fast
[1:37:09] and you can imagine the tears that were
[1:37:11] flowing
[1:37:12] not just because of the sickness and and
[1:37:15] the death of lazarus whom jesus
[1:37:17] loved but there was a heartache that was
[1:37:19] true in
[1:37:20] in the hearts of the of the those that
[1:37:23] believed in him because
[1:37:25] because jesus did not come
[1:37:29] when called
[1:37:34] there was a delayed response on the part
[1:37:37] of their dearest friend
[1:37:40] and the only hope that they had
[1:37:43] who never came neither did he send any
[1:37:46] word
[1:37:48] was silent
[1:37:51] but you see we're in the days of the
[1:37:53] breaking of the silence
[1:37:55] we're in the hour where the resurrected
[1:37:57] christ comes walking among us the i am
[1:38:01] come on oh yes he he was there in the
[1:38:05] prophet's ministry
[1:38:06] but he's got to be here in the bride's
[1:38:08] ministry
[1:38:10] amen yeah yep there and let me just say
[1:38:13] again friend
[1:38:14] his delay the delay of his coming it
[1:38:17] causes
[1:38:18] bitter tears to be weep amen when people
[1:38:21] who
[1:38:21] love his appearing they want to see him
[1:38:24] appear
[1:38:25] they want him up here in the service
[1:38:28] they want him appearing in their lives
[1:38:30] they want him appearing in the songs
[1:38:33] they want him appearing in the sermons
[1:38:35] they must have his appearing
[1:38:39] and when jesus don't come better tears
[1:38:42] should be wet from the
[1:38:44] church because she's our only hope
[1:38:48] and we can only have joy when he's here
[1:38:51] because when he
[1:38:52] ain't here there is no joy
[1:39:02] yet jesus is aware of all this he's been
[1:39:05] aware too
[1:39:07] he's been aware the church would go
[1:39:09] through seven ages
[1:39:10] he's been aware in the last days we'll
[1:39:13] return to be the bride of pentecost
[1:39:16] he's aware it's the hour it's the time
[1:39:19] and we've already seen him in his
[1:39:21] appearing amen
[1:39:23] come on now
[1:39:28] jesus knew that sickness
[1:39:31] had become death and he said
[1:39:35] our friend lazarus sleepeth
[1:39:40] and he had been silent now for days
[1:39:42] about lazarus
[1:39:44] and no doubt is a man remember we
[1:39:46] preached last sunday that jesus is not
[1:39:49] only god but he was man
[1:39:51] and as the man he was communicating
[1:39:55] with the father inside him
[1:39:59] so that he could do the father's will
[1:40:04] as a human he had other desires
[1:40:08] amen come on amen he would have to
[1:40:11] surrender those desires completely at
[1:40:13] gethsemane and say
[1:40:15] not my will but thine be done so he
[1:40:18] could show
[1:40:18] the human had a will but god had a will
[1:40:25] oh yeah the new birth does not take away
[1:40:27] human will
[1:40:29] you still have a will that's got to be
[1:40:30] surrendered up to god's will
[1:40:34] are you with me amen so he
[1:40:37] he knew and jesus had been silent for
[1:40:40] days
[1:40:41] about lazarus but he's about to break
[1:40:45] the silence
[1:40:47] i want you to get it back again we're in
[1:40:49] the hour of the breaking of the silence
[1:40:53] not only the silence of the seal but
[1:40:56] again
[1:40:56] a people who have been silenced
[1:40:59] now speaking prophesying again
[1:41:07] get these thoughts together as i try to
[1:41:10] weave them into one
[1:41:11] message and thought this morning
[1:41:15] he'd been silent for days about lazarus
[1:41:18] and as a man he was communing with the
[1:41:21] father
[1:41:22] inside him and brother branham said if
[1:41:25] jesus had to pray earnestly
[1:41:28] how much more do we have to pray
[1:41:30] earnestly
[1:41:32] and he said he prayed earnestly to stay
[1:41:36] in contact with the spirit that was in
[1:41:39] him
[1:41:40] i wonder if that's not the failure of
[1:41:42] the church
[1:41:44] they are not they are not communicating
[1:41:47] with the spirit the holy ghost inside of
[1:41:50] them
[1:41:51] man men and women should be led by the
[1:41:53] spirit of god
[1:41:55] directed by the holy ghost
[1:41:58] moved by the spirit
[1:42:02] the bible said in him we live and we
[1:42:04] move and we have our being
[1:42:06] that is the life of a christian of
[1:42:08] people who are moved
[1:42:10] by the spirit
[1:42:18] jesus now gets a vision
[1:42:24] because the father had showed him
[1:42:27] he knew now the purpose lazarus had died
[1:42:31] he was not there not allowed to to to
[1:42:34] to heal him to go minister to him
[1:42:37] because this would show his messiahship
[1:42:41] and that he was lord over the dead
[1:42:47] and now once he knew once he saw the
[1:42:49] vision
[1:42:50] he starts out for the home of mary and
[1:42:52] martha
[1:42:54] and he knew now that god had granted him
[1:42:56] the life of lazarus
[1:42:58] his friend and he says i go to awake him
[1:43:03] amen because you know and he says
[1:43:07] for this reason i'm glad i wasn't there
[1:43:11] you know because i had to wait for the
[1:43:13] fulfillment of the vision
[1:43:16] you see i couldn't raise him up before
[1:43:19] time
[1:43:20] and they would've been pulling on me and
[1:43:22] saying pray for him
[1:43:24] and they're faithful but i have to find
[1:43:26] faith
[1:43:28] amen there has to be some of someone
[1:43:31] that will connect
[1:43:33] with the nation oh that happier people
[1:43:37] connect
[1:43:38] with this prophecy today in revelation
[1:43:41] 10
[1:43:41] 8 of a people eating the book and
[1:43:44] therefore prophesying again
[1:43:47] of people uttering by the spirit moved
[1:43:49] by the holy ghost
[1:43:56] this resurrection of lazarus as i said
[1:43:59] would prove he was lord of
[1:44:00] the dead that he was indeed the god of
[1:44:03] the resurrection
[1:44:04] jesus knew that the arm of the lord
[1:44:06] would be made
[1:44:08] bare and laid there and the power of the
[1:44:10] resurrection would be made known
[1:44:13] this would pre-figure even the dead in
[1:44:16] christ rising
[1:44:17] it would pre-figure in some ways his own
[1:44:20] resurrection
[1:44:23] and he was had the power to take life up
[1:44:26] again
[1:44:28] yet still after all the vision
[1:44:34] can i bring it to you after all the
[1:44:36] prophecies
[1:44:37] after all the promises in the word amen
[1:44:41] after the vision being given to him
[1:44:44] he still must have the cooperation of
[1:44:48] someone's faith
[1:44:52] that somebody got to believe the report
[1:44:57] because it's only when people start
[1:45:00] believing
[1:45:01] that the arm of the lord can be revealed
[1:45:04] [Applause]
[1:45:09] i'm not trying to preach that you
[1:45:10] believe that i can do it
[1:45:12] i'm trying to preach to say that you can
[1:45:14] do it that
[1:45:16] you can be the consecrated dedicated
[1:45:19] sanctified holy ghost field church
[1:45:23] moved by the power of god
[1:45:31] somebody has got to start looking at the
[1:45:34] promise
[1:45:35] with faith with an expectancy
[1:45:42] it was a martyr that he would discover
[1:45:45] this faith
[1:45:47] now we wouldn't have really been
[1:45:49] surprised to find it mary
[1:45:51] because she sat at his feet and she's
[1:45:53] drinking in every word and
[1:45:55] surely she would be prepared for this
[1:45:57] moment
[1:45:58] to be full of faith this this
[1:46:01] mary we my goodness she was she was just
[1:46:04] always sitting at his feet and drinking
[1:46:06] in every word
[1:46:08] but martha it's just like you
[1:46:13] she was busy about other things
[1:46:17] she had to go push a pen on monday
[1:46:19] morning
[1:46:22] figure out numbers
[1:46:25] as an accountant said to prepare a
[1:46:28] lesson for the school
[1:46:30] where you would teach
[1:46:33] you had go get a job
[1:46:40] i'm trying to tell you this is not out
[1:46:42] of your reach
[1:46:42] [Music]
[1:46:44] say brother tim i don't have the hours
[1:46:46] and the time necessary
[1:46:47] to dare to sit in and drink and drink
[1:46:50] and be this woman of faith
[1:46:51] that's not what he found in martha
[1:46:57] what he found in martha was a woman who
[1:46:59] was busy
[1:47:01] hey man she was busy about other things
[1:47:04] she had been too busy to sit at his feet
[1:47:07] she was
[1:47:07] more worried about meal preparation and
[1:47:10] the busyness of life
[1:47:13] she had a family to take care of
[1:47:16] and here martha showed her real
[1:47:19] character
[1:47:21] amen and her real faith that she
[1:47:23] believed that
[1:47:24] jesus was the messiah the son of god
[1:47:27] the long expected redeemer
[1:47:31] amen and mountain shows us that we
[1:47:33] sometimes
[1:47:34] can be so overcome with life and the
[1:47:37] business of life
[1:47:39] that even though we are that kind of
[1:47:42] people in laodicea
[1:47:44] [Applause]
[1:47:46] amen we're self reaches and pleasures
[1:47:48] and all these distractions
[1:47:51] and cell phones and and the internet and
[1:47:54] all the other
[1:47:55] distractions amen oh and
[1:47:58] but they are capable
[1:48:02] you are capable of having
[1:48:05] great faith
[1:48:07] [Music]
[1:48:15] i'm preaching as brother branham and god
[1:48:17] of this evil age said to that
[1:48:18] faith woman
[1:48:23] the bride amen the faith woman
[1:48:32] the promises put before
[1:48:37] that brother shall rise again
[1:48:41] you know faith feeds on the promises
[1:48:45] come on you know you're over here
[1:48:48] looking at how little your faith is
[1:48:49] don't look at how little your faith is
[1:48:52] faith as a creative mustard seed can
[1:48:55] move a mountain
[1:48:57] quit looking at how little your faith is
[1:49:00] start looking at how big your god is
[1:49:04] how true are his promises that he never
[1:49:08] fails
[1:49:08] that his promises are omnipotent that
[1:49:11] there's power
[1:49:12] that is in his blood
[1:49:16] we're looking at how little your faith
[1:49:18] is and look how big
[1:49:19] god's promise is hallelujah
[1:49:23] and that the promise is not just to you
[1:49:25] but it's through your children
[1:49:27] and to them that are far off and any as
[1:49:29] many as the lord our god shall call
[1:49:35] hallelujah
[1:49:41] the promise is put before her thy
[1:49:44] brothers shall rise again
[1:49:46] the promises but before you behold i
[1:49:49] show you a mystery
[1:49:50] you will not all sleep but you shall all
[1:49:52] be changed
[1:49:53] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:49:58] hallelujah and then the promise is
[1:50:01] the dead in christ arise and we're in
[1:50:04] the age for it
[1:50:05] the promise is and we shall all be
[1:50:09] changed from mortals to immortality
[1:50:14] the promise
[1:50:18] hallelujah i don't know if i want to
[1:50:20] preach in english or other tongues right
[1:50:22] now
[1:50:23] but oh let the spirit utter
[1:50:26] that's a spirit's peace hallelujah let
[1:50:30] him speak through us
[1:50:36] hallelujah
[1:50:38] the promise is put before
[1:50:41] thy brothers shall rise again
[1:50:44] faith feeds on the promises of light
[1:50:46] wood that is throat on the flame feeds
[1:50:48] the fire
[1:50:49] faith will burst forth and flame high
[1:50:52] when it feeds on the promises
[1:50:54] if we look at circumstances we'll
[1:50:56] stagger
[1:50:59] we will fall amen i i cannot look at the
[1:51:03] circumstances
[1:51:04] of our brother ron spencer and what he's
[1:51:06] going through i cannot look at those
[1:51:08] circumstances
[1:51:10] even though even though we get little
[1:51:13] promises and
[1:51:14] hopes and things that are dropped to us
[1:51:16] a little bit of time
[1:51:18] this week you know one of the great
[1:51:20] things that happens
[1:51:21] some months ago he went to to a an eye
[1:51:25] doctor
[1:51:25] and they looked in his eye and said here
[1:51:28] there's cancer in your eyes
[1:51:30] said this melanoma we believe it started
[1:51:32] there
[1:51:34] and there with this melanoma in your
[1:51:36] eyes said we think it spread from there
[1:51:38] to other things and
[1:51:39] you got melanoma in your eyes he goes
[1:51:43] back for another eye exam
[1:51:44] this week and they said no we don't
[1:51:47] think it started there because there
[1:51:49] ain't even any cancer in your eyes
[1:51:58] last night he was having a heart attack
[1:52:00] and they rushed him to the er
[1:52:02] before he can get there all the symptoms
[1:52:04] are gone
[1:52:06] they are baffled don't know what it was
[1:52:08] don't understand what it was
[1:52:11] but you see the devil comes in on one
[1:52:13] side and on another
[1:52:14] but when the saints get to pray things
[1:52:17] start changing
[1:52:18] because when omnipotent faith quits
[1:52:20] looking at
[1:52:21] the circumstances and looks at the
[1:52:24] promise
[1:52:24] it can only be enough faith when it
[1:52:26] looks at the promise
[1:52:28] otherwise when it looks at the
[1:52:29] circumstances it's only unbelievable
[1:52:31] but today we stagger not at the promise
[1:52:34] of god
[1:52:35] through unbelief but we're strong in the
[1:52:37] faith declaring
[1:52:38] our god raised i'm not healed i'm not
[1:52:42] delivered
[1:52:42] i not saying that god is the same
[1:52:45] yesterday the day and forever
[1:52:47] i god is a living god he's the i am
[1:52:57] and this is why we must keep the word of
[1:52:59] god in our hearts
[1:53:01] amen we must feed upon it take this book
[1:53:05] and eat this book digest this book
[1:53:08] don't spit it up it'll make your belly
[1:53:11] bitter but don't spit it out
[1:53:13] keep it down if you keep it down it's
[1:53:16] going to come out his words
[1:53:17] and when it comes out his word it's
[1:53:19] going to be divine word
[1:53:21] it's going to be mountain movement words
[1:53:23] it's going to be more hallelujah
[1:53:25] it's going to be words amen that close
[1:53:28] down the wall
[1:53:29] it'll be words that'll open up the red
[1:53:31] sea
[1:53:32] it'll be words that cause the dead and
[1:53:35] pasteurized
[1:53:36] it'll be the word in power
[1:53:41] [Applause]
[1:53:52] hallelujah
[1:53:54] oh hallelujah hallelujah take a moment
[1:53:58] to worship him
[1:53:59] it's okay amen it's time that we break
[1:54:03] out in joy
[1:54:04] amen because we have returned back to
[1:54:07] the promise
[1:54:08] back to the face
[1:54:22] [Applause]
[1:54:28] you can have your seats that's why we
[1:54:31] must keep the word of god upon our
[1:54:33] hearts
[1:54:34] we must feed upon it faith
[1:54:37] cometh by hearing
[1:54:41] listen to the report hear the report
[1:54:46] believe the report that report will
[1:54:49] influence your faith
[1:54:53] amen it'll cause you to believe amen and
[1:54:57] by
[1:54:57] it you'll see the revealing
[1:55:00] and the bearing of his mighty arm of
[1:55:03] power
[1:55:04] [Music]
[1:55:05] martha believed that lazarus would
[1:55:08] indeed rise again
[1:55:10] she believed he would raise at the last
[1:55:13] day
[1:55:14] but she had no faith in the immediate
[1:55:17] resurrection
[1:55:18] of the body that laid in the tomb and
[1:55:21] jesus would have to adjust her faith
[1:55:25] from a faith that will work tomorrow
[1:55:29] to a faith that works today
[1:55:32] [Applause]
[1:55:34] are you with me amen and jesus said but
[1:55:37] i am the resurrection and the life
[1:55:42] and martha already knew right there you
[1:55:45] know
[1:55:46] right here is power because he would say
[1:55:48] martha
[1:55:49] already already you don't have to wait
[1:55:52] on the power
[1:55:55] you don't have to wait on the power of
[1:55:57] the resurrection that awaits the dead
[1:55:59] it's coming yes and i'm going to just
[1:56:02] say
[1:56:02] there will be a resurrection in the end
[1:56:04] time yes
[1:56:05] there'll be the power god demonstrated
[1:56:08] in the last days
[1:56:09] yes it will change our bodies
[1:56:12] oh men will become young again oh women
[1:56:15] will become young women again
[1:56:19] prosthesis will be no longer needed
[1:56:23] false teeth will go by the way of the
[1:56:26] ancients
[1:56:28] and of the discards
[1:56:31] you'll step from mortal to immortality
[1:56:35] but friends there is still the
[1:56:37] resurrection of life
[1:56:39] now that if he can do that in the body
[1:56:43] then he can heal your body now
[1:56:46] because this is the earnest of that
[1:56:51] for if there is no divine healing there
[1:56:54] is no resurrection
[1:57:03] i am the resurrection in life
[1:57:07] resurrection power is here jesus says i
[1:57:10] am it amen and
[1:57:14] though a man were dead yet shall he live
[1:57:19] and he said believeth out this
[1:57:23] he's saying martha if i can get you to
[1:57:25] believe
[1:57:27] you will see the resurrection
[1:57:30] but two omnipotents must work together
[1:57:34] they must connect the word of the vision
[1:57:38] has power in it but there must be a
[1:57:41] power of faith
[1:57:42] to unite with it to bring it to pass
[1:57:48] because i am
[1:57:52] not just in your future
[1:57:56] but i am the i am
[1:58:00] think of the voice of this i am it is
[1:58:03] the present tense
[1:58:04] of the eternal
[1:58:07] are you with me amen at the bad after
[1:58:10] burning bush it was
[1:58:12] moses first introduction to god and the
[1:58:15] first
[1:58:16] lesson that moses had to learn
[1:58:20] god is the i am he is here
[1:58:25] he is able he is willing to ought to do
[1:58:29] all that he promises to do now
[1:58:32] amen the future is now
[1:58:36] amen men are ready to postpone it and
[1:58:39] put it off in the future
[1:58:40] and we'll have the power of god one day
[1:58:43] but i want you to know
[1:58:44] the future is now
[1:58:49] god is blessing the past and he will
[1:58:52] bless in the future
[1:58:54] that is the truth amen we can preach
[1:58:57] sermons on how
[1:58:58] god blessed in the past we can preach
[1:59:00] sermons on how god will bless in the
[1:59:02] future
[1:59:03] god did the miraculous in his first
[1:59:06] coming
[1:59:06] and he will repeat them in his second
[1:59:09] coming
[1:59:10] but what we want to believe is that the
[1:59:12] presence is
[1:59:14] now but the problem is
[1:59:17] is people believe the presence the
[1:59:20] present
[1:59:20] is when god is absent
[1:59:24] did you hear me that's the problem
[1:59:27] they think god will be in the future oh
[1:59:29] yeah yeah they think god was in the past
[1:59:31] oh yeah yeah
[1:59:32] but right now he's absent
[1:59:38] and doing nothing god wants us to
[1:59:41] believe him as the i
[1:59:42] am come on that's how he wants you to
[1:59:46] believe he wants to
[1:59:47] that's what he was doing in this day
[1:59:49] doing the miracle doing the miraculous
[1:59:51] showing
[1:59:52] himself with signs and wonders
[1:59:54] vindicating a prophet to show you
[1:59:56] that i am god
[2:00:00] oh my gosh said oh yes lord you know one
[2:00:03] day
[2:00:03] my brother will rise again there's no
[2:00:06] doubt about it he was a good boy
[2:00:10] he was a wonderful boy and i believe he
[2:00:14] lived a good life and
[2:00:15] he he offered to shed blood and yeah
[2:00:18] he'll rise again in his time and it
[2:00:22] in his lot when the resurrection takes
[2:00:24] place oh you know
[2:00:26] mata martha could could say oh yeah he
[2:00:30] could he'll rise again
[2:00:32] but where is that martha who will say
[2:00:36] even now whatever you ask god
[2:00:40] he will do it that's his message today
[2:00:44] amen i am the resurrection to the dead
[2:00:48] i am the more the abundant life to all
[2:00:51] who live and believe in me
[2:00:53] come on church like martha god wants to
[2:00:56] arouse your expectancy
[2:00:58] amen so you can see his mighty arm being
[2:01:01] revealed
[2:01:02] you can see his word spoken out of the
[2:01:06] mouse
[2:01:06] of his elect and his arm may bear
[2:01:10] as they triumph over their enemy
[2:01:13] amen oh my there again he arouses their
[2:01:17] expectancy
[2:01:17] and says roll away the stone
[2:01:20] you got something to do to prove it
[2:01:24] you've got something you've got to do
[2:01:26] roll away the hindrance
[2:01:28] oh yeah he could have spoke and he had
[2:01:31] cracked the stone in two
[2:01:32] and splints and shouted into oblivion
[2:01:35] into
[2:01:36] a billion pieces and lives was coming
[2:01:38] forth but god said
[2:01:40] mel mata you moved the stone
[2:01:43] amen you moved the hindrance amen you
[2:01:46] roll away
[2:01:46] everything and prepare for god to do the
[2:01:49] miraculous

[2:01:53] the theologies
[2:01:55] that keeps the dead dead come on
[2:01:58] remember we roll away the ideas of man
[2:02:02] and our own unbelief roll it all away

[2:02:06] let god's word flow freely amen we've
[2:02:09] hindered it long enough
[2:02:11] we've held it back long enough it's time
[2:02:14] now to let the word of god float freely
[2:02:16] it's time now for the dead to come out
[2:02:19] of the grave
[2:02:19] for god to do the miraculous
[2:02:21] [Applause]
[2:02:27] martha's faith was to be the conduit
[2:02:31] to bring jesus and her dead brother
[2:02:34] together
[2:02:37] and death couldn't hold him no more
[2:02:40] because
[2:02:41] when martha's faith and
[2:02:44] you know was the conduit to bring jesus
[2:02:47] and connect
[2:02:48] him they meant to bring jesus and
[2:02:51] connect him to the dead body of her
[2:02:53] brother
[2:02:56] charges begin to fly dynamo began to
[2:02:59] happen and a man that was in the grave
[2:03:01] four days
[2:03:02] began to rise up out of that grave come
[2:03:05] on church
[2:03:06] hey man because she was the the the
[2:03:09] conduit
[2:03:10] and and and it brought it brought her
[2:03:13] faith was a conduit to bring the vision
[2:03:16] and and the dead together
[2:03:19] why corruption brother branham would
[2:03:21] often say corruption knew his master
[2:03:23] the soul knew its maker and a man that
[2:03:26] was
[2:03:27] dead four days to it at the voice of him
[2:03:30] who is the great i am
[2:03:31] [Applause]
[2:03:34] i'm saying to you today let your faith
[2:03:36] be the link between the power of god
[2:03:38] and the death that holds your body in
[2:03:40] sickness
[2:03:43] amen marta's faith linked
[2:03:47] and connected the omnipotence of god
[2:03:49] with the dead body of lazarus
[2:03:53] and your faithful link can unless the
[2:03:55] power
[2:03:56] of any divine promise
[2:04:00] in any situation
[2:04:03] god was showing us with lazarus they the
[2:04:06] case
[2:04:07] that that is too hard they ain't a
[2:04:10] problem
[2:04:11] that is too corrupted amen there is no
[2:04:15] body
[2:04:15] that's been too sick there isn't a
[2:04:18] sickness
[2:04:19] too great there is not a time
[2:04:22] when it's out of time because this god
[2:04:25] is an old time god
[2:04:26] and he's a god who moves beyond the
[2:04:29] circumstances
[2:04:30] of man that brings together the the
[2:04:33] faith of man and connects it with the
[2:04:35] promise of god
[2:04:36] and the dead itself will rise
[2:04:38] [Music]
[2:04:39] [Applause]
[2:04:40] [Music]
[2:04:42] martha's faith linked
[2:04:45] and connected with the omnipotence of
[2:04:47] god
[2:04:49] and connected that with the dead body of
[2:04:51] lazarus
[2:04:53] and your faithful link and unless the
[2:04:55] power
[2:04:56] of any divine promise with the need in
[2:05:00] any situation
[2:05:02] are you with me amen let's go on it's
[2:05:05] been said
[2:05:06] it's been said no faith no blessing
[2:05:09] little faith little blessing great faith
[2:05:13] great blessing according to our faith
[2:05:16] so it is always done to us
[2:05:20] you see the saving might of god's mighty
[2:05:22] arm
[2:05:23] either might be nearby and waiting close
[2:05:27] amen but it's there for the purpose of
[2:05:30] delivered but
[2:05:30] it's inoperable unless we are connected
[2:05:34] to it by faith
[2:05:37] this is why isaiah expounds this the
[2:05:40] negative side of this truth
[2:05:42] he said he uses the negative it says you
[2:05:44] know he complains
[2:05:46] that the arm of the lord is not revealed
[2:05:49] because men have not believed the
[2:05:51] inspired report
[2:05:53] amen the one in john however declares
[2:05:56] there which we read about in martha
[2:05:58] that it declares from the lips of jesus
[2:06:01] that those who believe shall
[2:06:02] see the glory of god
[2:06:06] so one of them is extolling the negative
[2:06:09] and saying look here here's the problem
[2:06:12] the reason why that you haven't seen the
[2:06:14] arm of god is because you hadn't
[2:06:16] believed
[2:06:21] it doesn't matter that he was wounded
[2:06:23] for your transgression if you don't
[2:06:24] believe it
[2:06:26] it doesn't believe that you're the
[2:06:28] matter that your iniquities are forgiven
[2:06:30] if you don't believe it
[2:06:31] a pardon is not a pardon unless it's
[2:06:33] received as a pardon
[2:06:36] it doesn't matter how much that the arm
[2:06:38] of the lord has power
[2:06:40] unless the report is believed
[2:06:44] amen the report is god's word
[2:06:47] amen he was wounded for my
[2:06:49] transgressions
[2:06:50] he was bruised for my iniquity and he is
[2:06:54] born
[2:06:54] our sickness our grace and by his
[2:06:58] stripes
[2:06:59] we were healed the report says that god
[2:07:02] laid on christ the iniquity of us all
[2:07:06] amen amen the report says that you're
[2:07:11] amen the report says that the worthy
[2:07:14] lamb
[2:07:15] has made you worthy that the book that
[2:07:19] john was unworthy to look upon
[2:07:21] once it was interceded and taken by the
[2:07:23] lamb then he was commanded to take
[2:07:26] it the book he could look at
[2:07:29] is now the book that is being taken
[2:07:31] because
[2:07:32] of the blood of the lamb who had
[2:07:35] believed this report
[2:07:36] that if you believe that report then do
[2:07:38] you the arm of the lord will be revealed
[2:07:42] but it will never happen unless you
[2:07:43] believe
[2:07:45] amen the arm of the lord is the power of
[2:07:49] christ
[2:07:50] and it cannot be revealed until the
[2:07:52] report is believed amen
[2:07:55] amen you know
[2:07:58] the report the report is they can't find
[2:08:02] him
[2:08:03] the report is he's missing from the
[2:08:05] churches
[2:08:06] the report is they haven't seen him
[2:08:10] now if you believe that you won't look
[2:08:12] there anymore
[2:08:14] amen if you believe that you'll go back
[2:08:16] to where he was left
[2:08:19] and find him there hallelujah
[2:08:22] if you believe that report you'll find
[2:08:25] jesus
[2:08:26] at pentecost again you'll find that he's
[2:08:29] still the same jesus
[2:08:31] amen that what he says confounds the
[2:08:33] priest
[2:08:34] and then he hills are sick it casts out
[2:08:37] devils
[2:08:37] it raises the dead it doesn't miraculous
[2:08:43] you'll find he's still the same god that
[2:08:45] he was in the book of acts
[2:08:52] this is what the arm of the lord can do
[2:08:55] but it must be connected with faith to
[2:08:57] do so
[2:08:58] john 11 40 said i not to thee if thou
[2:09:01] disbelieve thou shall receive the glory
[2:09:05] of god
[2:09:07] you see god's arm when it's outstretched
[2:09:10] and it's laid bare
[2:09:11] it has enormous power
[2:09:17] you know the spirit doesn't have an arm
[2:09:19] come on somebody help me preach this
[2:09:21] morning come on
[2:09:23] the spirit doesn't have an arm this is
[2:09:26] this is an analogy that is given where
[2:09:29] where it speaks of
[2:09:30] the the spirit of god doing a work on
[2:09:32] the earth
[2:09:34] when he says with his abstract arm
[2:09:38] amen this is the spirit of god moving
[2:09:41] through his people
[2:09:44] he has no hands but your hands no feet
[2:09:46] but your feet
[2:09:47] no eyes but your eyes no arm but your
[2:09:50] arms
[2:09:51] no mouth but your mouth he would have to
[2:09:54] borrow
[2:09:54] a prophet's body to speak through in
[2:09:57] this day
[2:09:58] amen to get a message across to you if
[2:10:00] it's of any count
[2:10:02] it has to borrow my body to preach a
[2:10:04] sermon
[2:10:05] [Applause]
[2:10:07] he borrows my body to lay hands on the
[2:10:09] sick and they shall recover
[2:10:12] amen he borrows the body of believers
[2:10:15] [Music]
[2:10:16] and he can do that because of the blood
[2:10:19] before calvary he would have to create a
[2:10:21] body
[2:10:22] and step in it but after calvary
[2:10:25] he is sanctified by what offers
[2:10:28] amen all of us forever i said forever
[2:10:32] amen he can borrow your body and you
[2:10:35] ought to be a person
[2:10:36] say god here's my body here's my bless
[2:10:40] here i am i want to surrender smile to
[2:10:42] you
[2:10:43] that you can speak for me live for me
[2:10:45] after me
[2:10:48] that you can manifest your glory
[2:10:56] branham was straight and stand there in
[2:10:57] the platform and he said now jesus
[2:11:00] is sitting on the right hand of god and
[2:11:03] he cannot come
[2:11:04] because when he comes he says we'll be
[2:11:07] changed
[2:11:08] but he says right now he can't come
[2:11:12] but he can come and borrow my body
[2:11:20] oh that there be a people today
[2:11:23] that would yield their bodies their
[2:11:25] members
[2:11:28] people who would pray until it wasn't
[2:11:31] them talking anymore
[2:11:33] but the spirit now talking through them
[2:11:37] god's arm when it's outstretched and
[2:11:40] laid bare
[2:11:41] is given in the scripture it signifies
[2:11:44] the energy of the most high
[2:11:47] it's first used when god speaks to moses
[2:11:50] and says
[2:11:51] i will redeem them with an outstretched
[2:11:53] arm
[2:11:55] and after crossing the red sea there
[2:11:58] were two million
[2:11:59] voices that were rejoicing with glad
[2:12:02] triumphant shouts
[2:12:04] and miriam would dance because the arm
[2:12:07] of the lord was revealed
[2:12:10] and such power that it held back the red
[2:12:12] sea
[2:12:13] and then it let it flood back destroying
[2:12:16] their enemy
[2:12:19] hallelujah oh i tell you church when
[2:12:22] that arm of the lord starts
[2:12:23] being revealed and you begin to see he's
[2:12:26] god
[2:12:26] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:12:29] like it was that day when i was
[2:12:30] preaching february the 18th
[2:12:32] when sister atlanta ran around this
[2:12:35] platform coming out
[2:12:36] of this uh this congregation coming out
[2:12:39] from the mezzanine
[2:12:40] you remember it amen what was it what
[2:12:43] was it
[2:12:43] she saw the arm of the lord in power
[2:12:47] that there was a bible jesus a bible god
[2:12:51] a bible doctrine a bible truth and we
[2:12:54] had returned back
[2:12:55] to a bible church
[2:12:58] hallelujah and when she saw her enemy
[2:13:01] was dead
[2:13:02] she ran around and around the building
[2:13:05] rejoicing
[2:13:06] [Applause]
[2:13:07] [Music]
[2:13:08] hallelujah last sunday when the choir
[2:13:10] was singing
[2:13:11] jesus is mine jesus's mind
[2:13:14] there's a name that is written in glory
[2:13:17] and it's mine
[2:13:18] oh yes it's mine people begin to rejoice
[2:13:21] and run around this building you know
[2:13:24] why because they saw
[2:13:26] and i am god they saw jesus's mind
[2:13:29] they saw he's not a distant god but he's
[2:13:32] a present god
[2:13:35] i'll tell you what when my wife ran
[2:13:37] around this room here
[2:13:40] last sunday she went back home a new
[2:13:43] woman and been cleaning her house
[2:13:45] and cooking and helping around the place
[2:13:48] with a renewed
[2:13:49] energy because jesus is mine
[2:13:52] jesus is mine but oh there's a name
[2:13:56] written in glory and it's mine oh yes
[2:13:58] it's mine
[2:14:03] hallelujah
[2:14:09] we've seen him put hair back when the
[2:14:12] doctor said there could be no hair
[2:14:14] we've seen heal the blinded eyes we've
[2:14:17] seen him restore
[2:14:18] we've seen him come and change lives
[2:14:20] we've seen him come and move
[2:14:22] because when you get a look at the i am
[2:14:24] god and you see him as the same
[2:14:27] yesterday today and forever
[2:14:29] then you begin to see his power on
[2:14:31] display
[2:14:33] the arm of the lord revealed
[2:14:41] and the next day there was no cancer
[2:14:43] revealed in sister atlantis
[2:14:46] a man in her chart no cancer why the arm
[2:14:50] of the lord
[2:14:50] had been laid bare and the arm of the
[2:14:53] lord had dealt
[2:14:54] a death blow to cancer and the prophecy
[2:14:57] had come forth
[2:14:58] in the pulpit your enemy is dead your
[2:15:01] enemy is dead
[2:15:03] your enemy is dead
[2:15:08] i'll tell you that's not a god of
[2:15:09] yesterday that is a god of the i
[2:15:12] am he is the god present the god our
[2:15:15] killer
[2:15:15] the god with an outstretched heart when
[2:15:17] somebody
[2:15:18] will believe it
[2:15:22] [Applause]
[2:15:26] hallelujah he'll make merriam dancers
[2:15:30] you're going to make joy in the camp
[2:15:32] it'll make the shot of the king
[2:15:34] it'll put joy unspeakable and full of
[2:15:37] glory
[2:15:38] it'll put where people can't sit in
[2:15:40] their seats anymore
[2:15:41] because they are extol in the great
[2:15:43] power of the almighty god
[2:15:45] that he is not a dead god but he's the
[2:15:48] same god
[2:15:49] that we have found him at pentecost that
[2:15:51] we have found him in the book of acts
[2:15:53] that we have found him in paul's gospel
[2:15:56] and we have returned
[2:16:05] miriam could dance because the arm of
[2:16:09] the lord was revealed in such
[2:16:10] power that it held back the red sea
[2:16:14] and then let it flood back destroying
[2:16:16] the enemy throughout the old testament
[2:16:19] it's a common phrase that points and
[2:16:21] prophets
[2:16:22] of israel describing god's redeeming
[2:16:24] power the barn with the barred arm of
[2:16:26] god
[2:16:28] throughout on the bible it is called to
[2:16:30] awake
[2:16:31] oh my to awaken would have to give out
[2:16:34] on me
[2:16:34] this time i'm not through yet
[2:16:37] amen throughout the bible the arm of god
[2:16:40] is called on to awake
[2:16:41] and put on strength amen throughout
[2:16:45] bible history because
[2:16:47] of the unbelief of israel think about it
[2:16:50] because of their unbelief the arm of god
[2:16:53] would lay
[2:16:53] inoperable amen and other times when
[2:16:57] faith was present
[2:16:58] it would reveal itself and vigorous and
[2:17:00] effective
[2:17:01] and powerful with strength how there's a
[2:17:05] direct relationship
[2:17:06] between god's strength of his saving
[2:17:09] might and faith
[2:17:11] god's great arm was revealed at the red
[2:17:13] sea
[2:17:14] making a path through its depths only
[2:17:19] to rest and sleep while israel wandered
[2:17:22] in the wilderness because they believed
[2:17:24] not his word
[2:17:26] in the days of joshua the arm of the
[2:17:29] lord was revived again
[2:17:31] it was revealed in power at the river
[2:17:33] jordan
[2:17:35] amen it would divide that river asunder
[2:17:38] when it was at flood stage
[2:17:40] isn't this amazing god doesn't wait
[2:17:42] until it's just a trickle going through
[2:17:45] he waits until his flood states
[2:17:48] hey man he makes a passage for the
[2:17:50] children of israel
[2:17:51] god a lot of times do that for you he'll
[2:17:53] wait till it gets a flood
[2:17:56] you think it can't get no worse than
[2:17:58] this and here comes another
[2:18:00] you can't think it'll not get any worse
[2:18:02] than this and here comes another
[2:18:04] amen but it's in those kind of times
[2:18:06] that jesus shows up on the scene
[2:18:08] and bears his mighty arm amen he would
[2:18:12] he would there he would make a passage
[2:18:14] through the reds or through the
[2:18:16] to the the jordan river it would throw
[2:18:18] down the walls of jericho
[2:18:21] amen it would chase and flight the
[2:18:23] armies of the aliens
[2:18:25] it would stop the sun and hold it back
[2:18:27] hold back the darkening shadows
[2:18:30] of the night and give a promised land to
[2:18:32] a chosen race
[2:18:34] because joshua never wavered in his
[2:18:37] faith
[2:18:42] but again it would sink paralyzed
[2:18:46] and powerless to rest during the days of
[2:18:49] the judges when people cease to exercise
[2:18:51] the
[2:18:52] faith to which nothing
[2:18:56] was impossible whenever the fire
[2:19:00] of faith would gleam and it would
[2:19:03] sometimes spark up from those ashes
[2:19:06] during the days of gideon and bayrack
[2:19:08] and jephthah and samson
[2:19:10] instantly the arm of the lord was made
[2:19:12] bear
[2:19:14] you'd see god coming within the days of
[2:19:16] gideon he said it's not going to be my
[2:19:18] mighty power i can't use what you got
[2:19:22] i can't use those that are fearful and
[2:19:24] unafraid afraid
[2:19:25] i cannot use those who are bound to
[2:19:28] idols
[2:19:30] i cannot use that let me get just a
[2:19:32] remnant
[2:19:33] let me get 300 i found 300
[2:19:36] and with 300 i'm gonna i'm going to
[2:19:38] destroy the millions
[2:19:40] of the midianites because if i can get
[2:19:44] to 300 believing
[2:19:45] is a lot better than thousands upon
[2:19:48] thousands
[2:19:49] of those that are bowing their knee to
[2:19:51] bail and those who are fearful and unfun
[2:19:54] for and are afraid i say if you're
[2:19:57] afraid go home
[2:20:00] i say if you're without courage it's
[2:20:02] time to leave
[2:20:04] this is the hour for the courageous this
[2:20:07] is for the hour for the people who know
[2:20:09] their god
[2:20:10] amen who are confident in that god
[2:20:12] because they them kind will be the kind
[2:20:14] that does exploits
[2:20:16] are you with me amen so again it would
[2:20:19] be
[2:20:20] it would be revealed in the days when
[2:20:22] david
[2:20:23] david's faith realized that the living
[2:20:26] god was still amongst his people
[2:20:29] and he was well able to save without
[2:20:31] without a coat of mail or spear
[2:20:34] or a shield or a sword
[2:20:37] but in the following days of those
[2:20:39] faithless kings
[2:20:40] the arm of the lord becomes dormant
[2:20:44] and allowed the enemies of god to
[2:20:45] overtake
[2:20:47] and they would enslave god's chosen
[2:20:49] people
[2:20:53] we're taught in the book of hebrews that
[2:20:56] all the exploits
[2:20:58] and and episodes of god's people
[2:21:02] they were all due to faith which
[2:21:04] believed that god was a present
[2:21:06] source he was a rewarder those that
[2:21:10] diligently seek him
[2:21:12] when jesus came dawn of the lord was in
[2:21:15] him
[2:21:16] for he was the fullness of the godhead
[2:21:18] bodily
[2:21:20] jesus never worked a miracle unless
[2:21:23] there was faith exhibited
[2:21:26] the centurion the series the syranesian
[2:21:29] woman
[2:21:31] you know no matter who it was she was
[2:21:34] this
[2:21:34] symphonising woman was accounted as a
[2:21:36] dog there was a leper
[2:21:38] who he was an outcast of that society
[2:21:41] but they could only draw virtue from him
[2:21:44] that would heal them and deliver them
[2:21:46] and save them
[2:21:48] if they believed and they did this while
[2:21:52] the bulk
[2:21:52] of the rest of the nation and especially
[2:21:55] those of his childhood friends down in
[2:21:58] nazareth
[2:21:59] would miss the blessings of seeing god's
[2:22:02] arm revealed
[2:22:03] they've missed seeing his great power
[2:22:06] manifested because of their unbelief
[2:22:09] jesus could do no mighty miracles
[2:22:13] among them i'll assert today
[2:22:17] that the terrible conditions that we're
[2:22:19] finding in the world
[2:22:20] is due because of his persistent
[2:22:23] unbelief
[2:22:25] unbelief is that it's all times high
[2:22:28] amen
[2:22:28] uh our our nation has went in his
[2:22:31] democracy
[2:22:32] with his freedoms to the extremes to
[2:22:34] freedoms that was
[2:22:35] never even intended by the original
[2:22:38] uh the original writers of the
[2:22:41] and authors of the constitution they
[2:22:44] never dreamed they would take freedom
[2:22:46] to the extent that men would marry men
[2:22:49] and women marry women
[2:22:51] they never took it to the extent of
[2:22:54] thinking that that you know that your
[2:22:57] freedom would mean
[2:22:58] the right to kill the unborn
[2:23:02] when they had written laws to protect
[2:23:06] the very citizenship of the of the
[2:23:08] nation
[2:23:10] amen we we have sunk down so low in
[2:23:13] unbelief and today what can you believe
[2:23:17] there is the sodom is clamoring at the
[2:23:20] door
[2:23:22] you can see it there even the righteous
[2:23:24] who are trying to stand for some type
[2:23:27] of of being conservative and
[2:23:30] under and they're they're gathering
[2:23:34] outside of their homes they're knocking
[2:23:35] at their doors
[2:23:36] they're writing down their streets
[2:23:40] amen they're they're doing exactly what
[2:23:42] they did in the days of sodom and
[2:23:44] gomorrah
[2:23:46] and don't think that that canada is
[2:23:48] exempt because
[2:23:49] if america is sodom day or gomorrah
[2:23:53] right now they're they're pushing a bill
[2:23:56] in the nation of canada
[2:23:58] that if it passed then that to them
[2:24:01] then churches would receive thousands of
[2:24:04] dollars of fines
[2:24:05] for preaching against homosexual
[2:24:08] lifestyles
[2:24:09] or refusing to to to uh honor gay
[2:24:12] marriages
[2:24:13] they are forcing their their so-called
[2:24:16] rights in the face of everybody else
[2:24:20] are you with me sodom and gomorrah is on
[2:24:23] its loo it's on the
[2:24:25] on the lease it is going there but i
[2:24:27] want you to know
[2:24:28] that there is a people outside of sodom
[2:24:31] they are not lot who is worried about
[2:24:34] politics
[2:24:35] they're not lot who's worried about
[2:24:37] keeping the mayor position
[2:24:39] and sitting at the gate of the city they
[2:24:41] are the seed of abraham
[2:24:43] and they have had the mystery revealed
[2:24:45] to them and they see there's an
[2:24:47] old time god a god who is a present god

[2:25:28] revelation 5 shows the book
[2:25:32] of man's lost estate and the right hand
[2:25:35] of god upon the throne
[2:25:37] and a lamb representing our kinsmen goes
[2:25:39] and takes the book
[2:25:42] he had been slain at calvary but here
[2:25:45] is the transfer of title of the lost
[2:25:49] estate
[2:25:50] back into the hands of man it leaves
[2:25:54] from being held in the right hand of god
[2:25:58] representing the power of god that no
[2:26:01] one
[2:26:02] who was unworthy could take uh had to
[2:26:05] take the the legal transferring of the
[2:26:07] lost estate back in the hands of a man
[2:26:10] it had to take someone worthy it called
[2:26:13] for a worthy man
[2:26:15] that worthy man was the same lamb of
[2:26:17] calvary
[2:26:18] he was now advancing in his redeeming
[2:26:22] work
[2:26:23] he is now taking the book of the lost
[2:26:26] inheritance
[2:26:27] and bringing back the lost estate to man
[2:26:30] again
[2:26:32] and it does not remain in heaven in the
[2:26:35] hands of the
[2:26:37] of the lamb but it transfers into
[2:26:41] into by the spirit into the mighty angel
[2:26:44] only christ it could be
[2:26:46] in an anointing that comes down that
[2:26:48] puts his foot upon the land and the sea
[2:26:51] and the book is open and when when
[2:26:54] the book is open to those on earth seven
[2:26:57] thunders uttered their voices
[2:26:59] and when it when he utters it points to
[2:27:01] the indians is the breaking of the
[2:27:04] silence
[2:27:04] that has been held up for thousands of
[2:27:07] years
[2:27:07] that now become known to an end-time
[2:27:10] people
[2:27:11] are you with me i want you to know
[2:27:15] friends god's silence has been broken
[2:27:19] people listen to me right now people
[2:27:22] have been looking for him
[2:27:24] amen but the silence his silence that
[2:27:26] was dead in it
[2:27:28] it's a dead in silence missing him in
[2:27:30] methodist
[2:27:32] baptist presbyterian pentecostal
[2:27:36] message churches everywhere a silence
[2:27:40] god isn't there it's a business silence
[2:27:43] he's missing
[2:27:44] but i want you to know there's a people
[2:27:46] that the silence has been broken to
[2:27:49] because christ has come down with an
[2:27:51] open book
[2:27:52] and it's an unsealed book and now the
[2:27:55] mysteries are made known
[2:27:57] but it doesn't just to end there with
[2:27:59] the prophet and his message
[2:28:01] it continues on with the people
[2:28:03] digesting and eating that book
[2:28:05] and becoming one with that word and
[2:28:07] prophesying again
[2:28:11] and we are in the days where it's the
[2:28:14] days we are mandated to speak

[2:28:30] to be revealed in the bride's ministry
[2:28:33] the arm of the lord is laid bare
[2:28:35] amen but what god doing to do that
[2:28:38] it takes an unleashing of faith
[2:28:40] connecting
[2:28:42] with the promise for you to start
