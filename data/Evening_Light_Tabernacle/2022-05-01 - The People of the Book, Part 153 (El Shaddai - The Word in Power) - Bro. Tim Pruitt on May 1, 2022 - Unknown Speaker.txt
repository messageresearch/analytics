she could get up and down she's had knee surgery so we um just thank the lord for bringing her through that the pain is not as bad and she's doing so much better amen we can look around and just see one another and just realize god has been so good to us we have been blessed the mercies of god his grace his strength for this moment in time we're blessed we're blessed with young men and women here that love the lord and you know we we have a special treasure in them we have a special treasure and real mothers that are that stands for righteousness and truth real dads great marriages good homes the blessings of god just keep going on and on and on we can't just mention them all but he we have been blessed [Music] i think about life's journey and ones that go with us in life's journey one that we join with in battle ones that we fight together with against the enemy on wednesday night while i was in service i got notification of that brother harold hildebrandt has crossed over on the other side he has been suffering with parkinson for some time um for a long time he suffered with parkinson's over a decade i think and the other day with just a little cold maybe not feeling the best but just pitched over and left us just one breath away is another dimension he's not dead he's still living he's just out of our reach and out of our sight for the time of course you can see there on the right was brother donnie reagan brother harold hildebrand with a buried coffee and i'm not sure who that other person is but as we think about it i kind of put it in your in your view because many of you younger ones don't remember brother harold perhaps he wasn't you know active in the ministry for the last 10 years or so because of the parkinson's or preached very limited and his home church still tried to be the pastor right up to the end they just had an 80th birthday celebration for him but the harold and i traveled all over africa together in nigeria and cameroon and tanzania and kenya and uganda i saw the great work that he did firsthand brother john laid testified of going to his church and in his church they would reprint books that you couldn't get and supplied all of africa actually all the world even we benefited from them we received some of the books and was able to share them with believers and this is over in uganda where that the believers there are just now receiving the new books that we have on the original sin and the five comings of elijah and jesus the name above all names we just sent funding for that what are these for these are for outreach things that i've written there to try to help them displace it in the scripture if you don't have them we have them at in our library i found that they not only help for outreach but they also strengthen the faith of believers because you can just place it right in the word this man brother harold was a pioneer started out many years ago in home meetings in edmonton grabbed the message took it around the world he heard the great commission that this message must be preached a lot of the footprint of the message in many foreign countries was on account of brother harold hildebrand he's the one who's helped establish hundreds of churches across the world but now he's stepped over into another dimension we remember him preaching our youth camp and also preaching in our labor day meetings the ones we held in mendon in the civic auditorium the ones we held in our church he was a powerful preacher a man of god god used him in a special way i just want to take a moment just to bow our heads and just stop here just for a moment and just think of god sending and using this servant to bless us with i remember him being with us brother daniel williams funeral and the memorial service there and the wonderful things that he said i remember daniel's love for him [Music] now they're together on the other side they are waiting on us to come to that place that god has ordained for us they're waiting what for for us to get to the point where the rapture can take place where they can come back here they're longing on to take on bodies again [Music] they were made for the earth and they're coming back to earth and taking earthly bodies and with us go away for a marriage supper and then come back for a wonderful millennial honeymoon spend eternity together this is what heaven's all about this is a place of reparation god's been so good to you i wonder what will be said of your life when you stand at the end what will be said of me have i made enough efforts have it done enough brother branham would look back at his own life and he said 50 years old i've done nothing for the lord [Music] great men have went before us done great things we got to pull the rank up a little tighter now there's others got to step in line we got to finish this race we are the finishers father today i want to thank you for brother harold hildebrand what he meant to us his friendship his love his camaraderie a soldier a man who stood and fought for zion fought for truth did everything to bring them into the present truth to see that they could bridge the gap between the denominational ages coming to the pride age lord we want to thank you for brother harold lord the many books that they printed the work that they'd done and these distributions that they made trip after trip spending almost a winter there every year just trying to establish every church help every brother do great works and translations lord we want to thank you his labors are finished now his work is done he goes home to rest back home their sister leanne his beloved wife and two children that are there and then from as he's joined sister marlene on the other side his wife 20 years ago we 21 years ago that we would put away in the grave she was on the other side she's been waiting for this moment for that first embrace i pray lord that you bless their children debbie and wendy and encourage all the grandchildren the great grandchildren the great greats lord what a legacy what a tribute to the grace of god men and women who are faithful to serve you i ask lord that you'll just minister to hearts today it's in the name of jesus christ strengthen the church for the ed hammermeister as they take the word forward whatever you do in that assembly use them lord in a great way for your glory we ask it in jesus name amen amen thank you lord amen thank you very much we're going to read from the word today and just looking to the lord to minister to us i'm going to read this quickly so you can be seated you've been standing a little while genesis chapter 17 and verse 1 and when abram was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying and then drop down to verse 21 but my covenant will allah establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham amen may you be be seated we thank god for his word today amen it's just so wonderful to see one of you today and we're looking to the lord to speak to our hearts and reveal himself brother timothy and i will be going to the memorial service we'll leave out thursday and and um i will be speaking that memorial service on saturday and be with the church there on sunday timothy will also be ministered in the area to with brother jerry fury and and um you know we only had a little short window of coming back home and um and then leaving to go to cloverdale for their 50th anniversary so we changed our tickets and so we'll be gone for the next couple of weeks but don't worry we've got a great ministry here i did want to announce to you that um we have done some very uh serious prayer and um thinking about what we could do as a church body and um to do greater things for the lord as we believe we're here in the end time we have um we have moved to support brother joe adams and his ministry he's going to be going full time and representing our church as he goes forth also brother aaron oglesby is going to be finishing up the school year and then he'll be going full time in the ministry as well we're also supporting him and there in order that um you know honestly you can't live on what offerings you get out by going out and preaching but they'll not only just be going out i've asked them to also be aware that we need them here amen and we're going to be using them utilizing their ministry and also already brother joe has moved out since he's already stopped work you know you you don't wrap your mind around exactly what is happening here you know when you when you when you can turn down um two hundred thousand dollar plus salary to go full time for the lord and you don't make even uh uh you know near near that just something to pay your expenses and and uh you know hardly to progress so you know again we we um we're just admire that kind of um you know work brother brother aaron is leaving a work that he has um um just a few years from retirement from that he could take a retirement um uh pay and so you know there's a lot of things that are being given up to press the battle for the last laps and we also are wanting to do everything we can to encourage the bride of christ i will be going out again more that than what i have and and trying to strengthen encourage preaching conventions and yet at the same time prayerfully using our time and so we as a church body were we're wanting to affect the world or wherever that the lord would lead and there's just lots and lots of work to be done as we finish the race now a lot of that work we can do right here and when i say that we are reaching around the world um japan will listen to this message in the archives it's because they're their times are different and also the um we we have a wonderful work there of course they're they don't belong to us they belong to god but we have helped established and got a picture from them today a wonderful work they're doing there a revival fire is going through uganda where there is hundreds upon thousands of churches now that are just embracing the message and they uh they need establishing in the present truth and that's why then i wrote this booklet on the godhead and i i'd like you to show that all these books that they're printing right there on um that we have we have put out on the five chemins of elijah this one establishes that god uses the spirit of elijah five times and it um identifies the comings of elijah and their ministries and where that they go um around around um in the end time where they fit in the end time picture and of course this is as i said one jesus name above all names on on the godhead and on water baptism and this is on the original sin which is again the um about the tree of knowledge of good and evil and what really happened in the garden and so we have done that to establish them where that um because because for example you know we have some wonderful things brother branham taught but we don't have it all in one one picture you got to get it from many tapes so we took those concepts and just placed it in the scripture and used the scripture to show this is a bible doctrine and so again the these are very important to the people there and we are we are helping them to get established this is an area that uh have not been established in the message that that brother bazabosi has going there and helping them to get further established in the present truth so there's a lot of things that are happening a lot of places that are calling many people that are desiring and um you know even um uh you know this this wonderful tent meeting brother ron spencer was in last night and of course they've had other ministers the brother jonathan martin brother wendell martin different others that have ministered i don't know their lineup of ministry but andrew glover i know ministered there in the tent meeting largest gathering of people in north america that brother ron has ever seen to come and hear the message so again you know it's a a great revival that is going on a stir um you know the devil thought he would do something with covet and shut us down it backfired on him there's a great hunger in the hearts of people let's get out to the meetings you know these things were spoke about um for example brother biscuit would talk about how he got on a motorcycle and drove all day and freezing weather and and then stop it you know at a house where he saw a light and pull up there and a man invite him in and he spend the night there some guy doesn't even know and you know and then he feeds him a meal and puts him on the road to go again he drives again all the day there was a burning in the hearts to to get into those meetings and they talked about the holy spirit of god fallen in those meetings and and one side speaking you know of of um the lord being mighty in battle and you know and then the other side waving back and forth just waves upon waves of the glory of god and i you know i i i know we have the word today we have the message and i believe that we can have those same things that are happening that happen back there happening right here because we are here in one of the mightiest revivals you say when did this revival start it started by the opening of the word with a prophet coming with a message and even brother branham told us in 1965 the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the lord we've had 56 years of of of just absorbing the message and and and get it in our you know all of it you know at our fingertips and where we could hear it and where we could research it where we could comb through it we've had 56 years of that but i tell you what we are right now in the final stages and i believe the word that we have been hearing has become flesh and so because it's become flesh it's going to be made manifest now so again um today we're going to be speaking on el shaddai the word in power we have been ministering on this subject of el shaddai because the appearing of god as el shaddai was um a a picture of a type a shadow that was prophesying of the last days now they didn't know they were prophesying they didn't realize that this was something that god was showing in type that he would do in the latter days and then the appearance of god as el shaddai was a personal experience with god to abraham and it was more than an anointing yet it wasn't an anoint an anointing this experience anointed and raised his faith to look for the promised son and of course this anointing that we have been anointed with in this last day by god's sin and a prophet has um has raised our faith to look for the promised son now it's not just god's sin and a prophet but it is that we also have been brought into a personal experience with god himself now you know again when this happened with abraham and expectation seized him as he pondered over the things that almighty god had said now we also as a royal seed of abraham have had the appearance of el shaddai the outpouring of the holy ghost in this last day is raised faith to believe for the long-awaited promised son to appear now as we speak of that i want you to understand we are anointed there's no shame in being anointed in fact of the matter is great favor to be anointed if you look there when jesus would open the scripture he said he said the spirit of the lord is upon me and it has anointed me to preach the gospel so again we are here in the last day where that spirit that was anointing jesus now came and anointed the church on the day of pentecost it is a continual anointed we could go and say well it anointed wesley and anointed luther and it anointed azusa street but now that anointing is resting upon a people in this last day now so you know sometimes the thought is oh but you know we don't want to be anointed because we don't want to be the anointed ones at the end time but i want to say yes we do we have better be the anointed ones at the end time we are the anointed ones at the end time the anointing wasn't sent from the for the chair it was sent for the wheat and we want the anointing we want to be anointed preachers with anointed sermons we want anointed singers who sing anointed songs we want anointed people and anointed churches and an anointed word we want men and women who know how to get in the spirit you see we are our name is not unbelief we're not going down in defeat we are that faith woman who like sarah this princess is a mother and she's bringing forth the king line and we are we are united as a princess to our lord the king and so you know sarah received strength by judging him faithful who had made the promise but she had to quit putting limits on god we must not ever put limits on him as brother bradham said jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever his power is unlimited but it's limited to your faith do you believe it that's confirmed among thousand times thousands of people so his power is unlimited but yet it's limited to your faith your faith can limit god your lack of taking hold of the promise is the only thing is going to limit god from fulfilling the needs that's in your life amen so it's like but it's like god told gary walker when he went through his great trial of a of the horrible wreck he said if you could see the bigger picture you would sign up for this and i want you to know whatever you're going through if you could just see the bigger picture it is it is an opportunity for god to work it is an opportunity for us to exercise faith it is an it is an opportunity for god to fulfill his word to show himself in a miraculous miracle working power so you see well you know again we we want to look at the bigger picture you look at the problem you look at the issue and you know you know we look at brother ron and the horrible trial that he has been through but you know when he preached last night with such power and showed the world a miracle are you with me i mean if he dies tomorrow he's been one of the greatest miracles that you've ever witnessed amen because because again god has shown himself in power over and over and over again amen so you see we want to see the bigger picture of things and and again you know this was abraham he was walking with god but he couldn't see the bigger picture why and god was trying to expand his vision by the visitation of el shaddai and and even with with sarah god rebuked sarah when she laughed when she snickered at the thought of the impossibility of a 90 year old having a baby you saying and god rebuked her saying is there anything that is too hard for the lord i tell you sometimes we need a rebuking doubting snickering at the old woman to church to have signs of life amen snickering that she might speak in tongues or prophesy or see evidence of the holy spirit working in our lives that the young people in all the life can receive a true experience of the baptism of the holy ghost that's miraculous amen but you see why would we doubt and snicker that the old woman the church can come to such a place that she could be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that she too can receive the promised son that has been looked for for many many years that many have given up all but we're not giving up on the promise amen we're not giving away up on what god said there is to be a resurrection in our day and all the dead in christ arise there is to be a change in the body all of these things are are laying in here the greatest of the miracles that has ever happened i want to expand your vision and let you see we are here on the verge of the greatest miracles ever happened the chains of the body the resurrection of the dead we're not just skeletons come to life but dust gathers together every cell and comes back what hour are we living in el shaddai gives a promise i'm going to give sarah baby what does that mean why is it that god would even do this you think it was just to make a jewish race no the jewish race was was a natural seed and when they were prophesying god used them to prophesy of a royal seed now so again how in the world is all of this going to happen these are maybe the questions that that abraham would have when god just suddenly abruptly left him and went up and left off talking i told you what's going to happen it's up to you now to believe it now there was a lot of things to stagger at and i'm telling you there are a lot of things in our age to stagger out how in the world will god get a people to the place they need to be in this evil age and god lets it happen the worst stage ever the time where sodom repeats the time where evil abounds like never before and in that moment el shaddai comes what is elsa it is the baptism of the holy ghost it is an outpouring of the spirit brother branham told his clothed crick clearly el shaddai is the holy ghost and this is where in type that abraham receives the holy ghost now we know the holy ghost was not yet given but god is showing up of a greater event that is going to happen when a people receive not a part of the spirit of god enough to justify your sanctify your speaking tongue but the entire spirit of god coming down into a people this is unusual service i feel the holy ghost all over me i want you to be really intent let the holy spirit speak to you by how in the world is this old woman going to have this child it will be by drinking from el shaddai you know by baptism after baptism of the holy ghost i don't care who you are it's time for another baptism amen we must drink until our bodies are changed we can drink divine healing we can drink miracles we can drink anything any promise it's all there there is no lack we must not stagger at god's promise nothing is too big for you to believe for instead of doubting we got to turn to praise amen and we will praise him because he's more than enough and i said why shouldn't we we've had enough miracles just built in this church building to see that god is more than enough you see if god is your partner you better have big plans amen because we are here in the continuation of the book of acts abraham considered not the cancer or the brain bleed or the seizures or the old age or the sickness i'm telling you right now you don't even have to consider your old age well it's just normal for me to be this way no it ain't normal that it don't have to be your normal you can be a healthy well 90 year old it doesn't matter it is it should be normal to believe for the impossible it should be normal to believe for divine healing it should be what we do i heard of a couple of skirt ladies that was in a in a place i got a testimony from a lady kathy jeffers and her her aunt was given a testimony of how she went into a cracker barrel and there they you know she carried her her aging uh family member i think it was a mother and and and there she was in in there in the cracker barrel and then and uh they were trying to have a meal together her sister and the aged mother and she dropped dead the aids mother just dropped dead right at the table and here in this in this um in this moment you know they begin to scream out we need somebody who can pray and and she said a bunch of these these she called them holy rollers holy rollers with long dresses come over and laid hands on her and she raised back to life again said they had pair they had people there that were trained to know whether somebody was dead or not and took her vitals and she was gone but you see these skirt ladies come running over there and laid hands on her amen you know and and and then you know they carried them out and the ladies went right back to eating their lunch she cracked a barrel as if this is something we do every day and i'll tell you what this ought to be the attitude of the bride of christ that even among our ladies they know we can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we know what to do because of who we are [Applause] a people filled with the holy ghost of people prayed up are people who know their god and does exploits a people that only consider what god says who turns bad situations from unbelief to a praise he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but he was strong in faith giving glory to god so the devil wants to cut off our praise yet that's the way uh that's the way of giving voice to our victory we overcome by the blood the lamb and the word of our testimony amen when we drink from our shady eye it brings the praise out of our life come on now listen when the lamb opened the book in heaven heaven worshiped and sang a new song amen whatever they do in heaven we ought to do the same thing on earth when the book is open to you you're going to sing a new song and have a new worship and you're going to worship the lamb hallelujah it seems that human nature needs both order and freedom amen that's kind of human nature we want both order and freedom and many of us handle the split and our needs by keeping order in our religious life and leaving freedom to ball games and political rallies that's the way we split it up we're going to order in church but we want freedom at a ball game amen my goodness we ought to have freedom at church and there ought to be a praise come forth from the church there's got to be an amen to the word of god there's going to be a response had he right you don't sit there and just nod your head you respond and say that's nothing but the truth and that's a way to get god to move back to you but you know let me just tell you from the bible how they handled the split how that they they handled it as human nature as i said needs both seems to need both order and freedom so they get freedom at ball games freedom at political rallies but all we got this sanctimonious nobody's supposed to say nothing in church let's read it from psalms 150 let's see how to handle it in the bible praise he the lord where praise god in his sanctuary hallelujah praise him what he praise him in the with the sound of the trumpet amen praise him with the sultry and the heart praise him with the timbrel and the dance praise him with string instruments and organs well we don't want to get power we don't want this we don't want a piano we don't want that and we all sure don't want drums but praise him upon the loud symbol and praise him with the high sounding symbols amen in other words get loud with it praise him upon the loud ones get loud about it amen this is freedom in the house of god are you with me praise him on the high sounding symbols watch now let everything that has breath [Applause] you say well brother tim i ain't worthy

move a little further amen they ought to bring a praise out of your heart amen in order to bring something down where you're responding where you're never disconnected in a service but you are responding to the voice of god speaking to you great is the lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable and the messaging said oh yeah you're going to have to do a little better amen oh one generation shall praise thy works to another and shall declare thy mighty acts in other words my generation amen shall praise his work we're going to tell what god did for us we've got a testimony and we're going to pass that to the other and declare his works and every generation tells the other generation my god is a great god my god is a healer my god is a deliverer my god is the savior he saved me he turned my life around hallelujah there's some good response now there's some good response i don't care you sit back there but respond to the word of god i don't want anybody disconnected i will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty and thy wondrous works and men shall they speak of thy the might of thy awesome acts and i would declare thy greatness they shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness and sing of thy righteousness well i'm tired of you talking about drew and sister karen and and sister atlanta and i'm so i'm sick and tired of you bringing uh the you know this one up in that one and what god did for justin and what god they shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness and shall sing of thy righteousness [Applause] glory we have drank from el shaddai and it's so good i say it's so good we gotta tell of his goodness when they nurse him else had i in the upper room they spoke in other languages telling the wonderful works of god they even heard them in other tongues other languages telling of the mighty words of god when you drink of thou shalt eye it's going to bring something out of you when the holy ghost fell on the gentiles in the house of cornelius and man you say yeah brother jim that's where peter spoke these words the holy ghost said fell upon them and so you just get it in your seat well let me tell you they knew that they'd received the holy ghost because they spoke in tongues and magnified god something happened something happened other than warm and a pew a drink from hell shut out will make you shout it'll make you shout the praises of god it'll make you speak in other tongues it will make you know who you are in christ he said to abraham i will be your god. psalms some says happy is the people whose god is the lord and the people whom he's chosen for his own inheritance happy are those people amen first john 4 and 4 you are of god little children can you identify in this scripture you are of god little children amen and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world hallelujah greater is he the the el shaddai the holy ghost that is in you who is more than enough let me tell you our god is not just external somewhere dwelling in the heavens above and looking down beholding the children of man our god is hell should i amen he pours out himself the holy ghost within us and from him we drink his goodness from the word we receive his strength from his spirit receive of his power and greater is he that is in us than he that's in the world amen why can't we praise him because greater is he that is in you than he that's in that cancer amen come on now he he that cancer is a spirit [Applause] and we as a church have been commissioned to cast him out [Applause] yeah amen now so greater is he that is in you than he that's in the cancer greater is he that's in you that that sickness because sickness is interrupting the very laws of god by the way i'm i'm i'm quoting from a sermon that you might know greater is he that's in you and he says you see greater is he than is in you than that sickness because sickness is interrupting the very laws of god you see well greater is he that is in you that is healer and creator than the devil that's interrupted the program of your life greater is he that is in you than he that's in oral greater is he that's in you than that wheelchair greater is he that's in you than a stretcher greater is he that is in you than that cancer greater is he that is in you than that affliction greater is he than anything there is the devil could put upon you greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world greater isn't he is he so he's worthy of praise yes he is greater was he that was anointed david than the goliath the biggest devil in the land david considered not the size of goliath this wasn't in the equations his only eye was on his god i come to you in the name of the lord god of israel he never mentioned he never mentioned having you know great training and i did this and i made preparation and i'm ready and and i'm capable he never talked about his own weaknesses he didn't keep measuring come on he didn't keep me measuring him so why he's twice my size nine foot tall nine foot tall three inches tall and i'm five foot three and a half and spent all night sleepless because of the roar of the report of the doctor amen but he said we meet the roar of this philistine with these words you come to us with threats of what harm you will do to us and how you will bring us down but we'll come in the name of the lord god of israel that's all david mentioned i don't need nothing else but jesus and because i'm full of jesus and greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world you come with the name of lukewarmness amen but we come in the name of the lord jesus christ you come in the name of cancer but you are uncircumcised you know what that means you're not in the covenant amen cancer is not in the covenant you got a different covenant than cancer come on amen it's not in the covenant that god made between you and him he said he said is there anything too hard for the lord you come with the name of bareness but i want to tell you you should be blessed above all people amen can i give you i'm talking about the barren church now amen it's barren women it doesn't matter you know barren souls amen bearing homes where where children have went away and strayed away from god are you with me but i want to tell you this you shall be blessed above all people look at your neighbor and tell them i'm blessed amen because you shall be blessed above all people you said i have been blessed i'm telling you you have been blessed above everybody else god has favored you beyond your expectation or even what you deserve amen somebody in this side say amen amen okay you shall be blessed above all people there will be no male nor female baron ammonia hallelujah every one of you is going to bring forth christ don't matter if you're a man or you're a woman you're going to bring forth christ to this generation amen because you're not a barren people you are under a covenant he makes the barren woman abide in the house as a mother of children praise the lord as a joyful mother of children god will take the barren woman sarah and make her laugh hallelujah make her laugh no matter what the devil has said no matter the devil said you're too old you're two people you can't make it it's impossible are you with me now amen you will be a joyful mother of children amen the bride of christ is going to bring forth christ the spirit of christ in this day praise the lord your wife shall be like a fruitful vine within your house your children live like olive plants around your table i'm telling you the bible said we're going to have our isaac laughter is coming the bride will bring forth you know why because el shaddai who represents all the word all of god it represents an open book exposing the breasts of the old and new testament all the bible from genesis to revelation divine promises lay it there and it's not exposed to everybody you say the seventh seal brother jim is not revealed is not revealed to many people amen but it has been revealed to the bride of christ are you with me amen nothing is held back because why you have been brought into the secret place where god comes and gives you his own life now all the word is heading up into her brother branham says this in god of this evil age he types it like the grain of wheat heads up into the grain again where it started from the grain of wheat heads up to the grain again where it started from let me stop there for a minute do you know we're fulfilling all the types or every promise that spoke of a bride is being fulfilled in you you are you are the absolute fulfillment of all scripture everything that spoke of the bride of course since they spoke about the harlot that ain't us there's things spoke about tribulation saints that ain't us there's things spoken about foolish virgin that ain't us but every word that spoke of the bride is being manifest in bride form today luther only represented a part wesley represented a part it was portions of the spirit think about that for a moment you see we will say there when they when they come into that place they began with the cross and that's where a lot of people are a glory in the cross you know the cross the cross and the message you know jimmy swaggart if you ever hear hear him speak he'll talk about some mysterious thing that they got on the cross revelation on the cross i know what it is you know when you come to the cross you live any kind of dirty life and you're forgiven you're okay because you're at the cross so i know his secret it's a dirty one but that's the dirty secret of most denominations that's why we're at the cross and god forgives us of our sins and jesus paid the price and we glory in the cross but i tell you there's things of his revealing of his purchasing work you know that he began at calvary expands to his claimant work where he claims the title deed for every believer because you are the names in the book are you with me it's a revelation of god personally to you where he comes into you and and he opens the book he looses the seals he unbuttons himself why because he's got a child and that child needs strength now that child's 100 years old but it's got a nurse to a body change we might be 2 000 years old hello sarah but we got to nurse your body change amen we got to start believing i mean come on if we can't believe her divine healing brother branham said i can't get the church to even believe for divine healing which is just just healing a portion of your body how am i ever going to get you to believe you're going to be changed from head to foot and you'll travel like a thought so he says like the grain of wheat heads up in the grain again where it started from you know so we got a couple of types there one type is the latter rain the latter rain comes as the moisture it is the pouring out of the spirit he said my range shall fall as doctrine but that doctrine is is not just law or word only it is spirit and life the words that i speak are spirit and light so you cannot separate the word from the spirit say well we got the word well if the spirit isn't there you don't have the word amen you say well i got the spirit if the word isn't there you don't have the spirit it takes both of them to make up the word the word is spirit and life it is also doctrine and god brothers doctrine and it was a latter rain hello amen and the and the and the rain fell upon us it was the anointing of the mighty angel like a change of picture it was coming down as the anointing of the mighty angel the son of man the word revealing himself and pouring himself out into a people so it is the latter rain we are part of that latter rain because the latter rain matures the grain for the harvest it causes to come back to the head again that's what this message produces another book of acts church amen now we got another type and that other type is we lay in the presence of the sun and ripen and they're still talking about immaturity in other words we mature by the light of the word it has nothing to do with baking out the holy ghost and tongues and interpretation and prophecy and all the other manifestations of god it has nothing to do with oh divine healing is a greenness that's not greenness that's the life are you with me amen the greenness was your immaturity but god sent a message to bring you the full word where you're not you're not just a partial you're not just a little tiny you're not this just a shock you're not just a blade you're you are you you're not just a sprout but you are the grain again and he says the word bride like the wheat heads up into the head again is heading up into the person of the word it's heading up into the person of the word of god amen the word bride heading up in the person of the word of god making manifest in this evil age we're living in so what is happening the word bride is heading up in the person of the word the word now taken on flesh the full word back again the person of the word it is the person it is heading up to uh and into is not brother branham never did he point to us as him being the uh as him being the fullness of the godhead bodily amen neither did he point to us any kind of personality called leader but he did say that the full word would be in the church she is heading up in the person of the word is anybody with me now heading up in the person of the word that's who the bride is she is the person or the body of the word this bride is the person of the word made manifest manifesting all the word every promise every gift all of his righteousness all of his holiness which without no man can see the lord now look right after expressing himself as god almighty he appears to abraham and sarah as elohim the self-sufficient one the eternal one and he deserves sarah's heart showing the sign of the son of man that the word was here in full power every time there was a discernment made telling who you are where you come from what your problem was what your what your future holds everybody every bit of that was the proof it was the sign the word was now present because it discerns the thoughts and intends the heart only the word so it showed us that the son of man was present not in brother bran a man of pride amen brother branham said i challenge you to believe that jesus christ is revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh through the bride's body this is where the word is on display amen the sign of the son of man was operated through the prophet but you are the the you are jesus christ revealed in the form of son of man and human flesh in the bride's body each one of us making up a part and you're manifesting the fullness of the word not apart the bride manifested the son of man christ his full person his full person in bright form i want you to get it his full person not in jesus the man of galilee that's where everybody's pointing back to they're pointing back the man of galilee what jesus did what jesus said and all of those things are wonderful acts and wonderful words but that is not who is here today the man of galilee is not walking into our church he's not preaching from our pulpits amen i'm talking about the flesh of jesus christ but i want you to know that the full person of the word is being manifest in bright body he is not in the form of jesus he is in the form of a bride don't you understand this is the bride coming of christ this is what reveals sarah was reflecting the bride coming upright a woman made new restored fixed i don't mean neutered i'm being repaired i've been made new amen but just a few days later here's a young king wants to marry her you say why in the world was that story in the bible why did they record that god wanted you to know the extent of sarah's transformation because it would reflect the extent of your transformation where you would be made young again so the bride is manifesting the son of man christ his full person in bride form that can you say amen to that amen so again that makes us living word of god living epistles we got epistles written in the bible but you are the word written in flesh that's who the bride is now it makes us a people born of the word that has power amen the living word the living bride a word that vibrates with power a bride that pulsates with life i i just want to get it to you they eat the book but they don't just eat the book they become the book amen you eat of things it becomes part of your body it nurses cells in your body when the bride eats the word she becomes the word her and the word become the self same thing that's why the bride does mighty acts because she's the word they in the word become one the bride is an open living bible because we when we receive the word the prophet said we become the word amen are you with me amen the bride has become the open living book by eating the book to express the fullness of god that's why she doesn't just keep it and choke it down and she got it and i i got the message she speaks the message the word comes out of her amen come on amen you've got to let the word come out of you instead of your own human negative thoughts [Applause] because you are still two parts you are human and you're god oh you didn't like that you're god by the new birth you were born god are you with me pigs give birth to pigs and my goats give birth to goats kids we call them and the chickens give hatch out chickens are we surprised what happens when god gives birth that god gives birth to little gods hallelujah that means that life that life is within you abundant power dwells within you and the true bride of christ the true born-again church in this hour i'm quoting brother branham is the living word of god digest that a minute the true born-again church in this hour is the living word of god it's the word of this age made manifest search the scriptures and see what's supposed to be in this age there's christ living again just changing his mass from one to another hallelujah he once was in luther but then he come in wesley then he changed his mask and was with the azusa pentecostal people then we saw him in the divine healing movement and now he's here he's saying to god he just changed his mask come on the word that spoke to abraham and sarah now speaks of us we are the people nursing from el shaddai the holy ghost amen ever born again son or daughter of god of this age is the interpretation of the word this is what the prophet said i just quoted him amen all right man every born again son or daughter in the mezzanine how many is up there born-again sons and daughters all right amen got a little participation from someone wake up now over here on this side amen so you again right here through the church [Music] see how they responded come on mezzanine you can do better now said brother tim you're preaching on the i am trying to connect you [Music] i'm trying to get you to get to quit being another church back there that is disenfranchised from the rest of us get in the spirit and if you can't get it back then get up close when the holy ghost is moving every born again son or daughter of god of this age is the interpretation of the word [Music] hallelujah young people you are the interpretation of the word of god what god wanted in the young person fathers you are the interpretation of the word what god wanted in the father women you are the interpretation [Applause] everybody not somebody there jezebel with their pants on and going out there and acting like a man and cross-dressing and everything else come on now amen you are the interpretation of the word of god you are that word made flesh i say hallelujah amen i say hallelujah that means our skirt ladies ought to have a power in them that they know their god when a crisis comes up they know how to call god down from heaven because they have been listening on their shed eye [Applause] [Music] hallelujah amen you feel that way this morning mama that's me that's me that's me that's who i am of the word of god of this hour you are the message the message is not books the message has been made flesh hallelujah what did the holy ghost do when it came look down look at our sinai it wrote it in tablets of stone is that right god wrote for the first time in the bible he wrote and tablets a stone but that's not where he wanted them he wanted them written in a heart and on the day of pentecost 120 in the upper room hallelujah in the upper room god wrote his law in their heart they became the word made flesh we are the fulfillment of every promise all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was was poured into church the believers you believe that let me read it again so you assortment all that god was think about all that god was all that god is he poured into christ somebody say amen you know he poured it into christ all of god listen he was the sons of david he was the wisdom of solomon he was a prophecy of the prophets come on church he was all of the word in the body hallelujah and all that christ was was poured into the church the believers hallelujah el shaddai has made a transition it moved there lord of god it was just my personal experience all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was was poured into the church the believers now in this time the fullness of god has come it was portions and wesley portions and women in azusa street portions of luther but now in this time the full word of god the fullness of god has come what was once in christ now comes into the bride for now he is expressing himself i'm quoting now he's expressing himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church oh jesus was the expression of god we agreed with that but now you the bride of christ becomes the expression of christ hallelujah bride he can say she's burning my bones she's flashing my flesh and she's lighting my life and she's powering my power she's me that's me right there in another form a changed mask himself in the fullness of the god has deity through his church have the preeminence in this church you know how he gets the oversight the leading the preeminence in you that's the baptism of the holy ghost quit making a mystery out of christ the mystery of god revealed he was demystifying christ amen he was showing you that god was revealed and he in christ but now he's revealing himself in the church are you with me amen so again when he has the preeminence in his church listen when you said brother when i get the holy ghost i've been seeking when you give him preeminence the moment you give him your all and he has some preeminence in your life from your hair down to your feet with your social life and your gaming we're raising we we're seeing a whole generation of people that don't know nothing more than this their time is wasted their efforts are wasted satan's trap is a distraction from what's really important we are in the midst of a body change [Applause] are you with me we're in the midst we are the rapture hallelujah leave your gaming behind and get in the real game amen and take on the rapture hallelujah because that's who we are we are the pride of christ now in this time the fullness of god has come what was once in christ is now comes into the bride for he is now expressing himself in this last day himself as a in the fullness of the godhead bodily deity through his church have preeminence in the church what now listen stop there a minute how did abraham stagger not he had to give the word that el shaddai said preeminence before then you know ishmael was his now god says no it's not going to be ishmael to be isaac now he has to refocus now he has to change and realize god's going to do something very supernatural here amen and god gives him some instructions i'm going to do this i'm going to do this and then isaac's on my seat be called and you'll name him isaac and god leaves don't question me no more believe what i said stop asking me why me lord why am i going through this god might be sparing you from a lot worse things as i traveled to church today there was a man you know meeting here turning into a nursing home i said thank you jesus that's right that's not me it ain't me turning into a nursing home today to go see a beloved one that don't know who i am amen a lot of things you know but again you got to have god give god preeminence preeminence you gotta change your thinking take down the negative thoughts start believing in the impossible the anointed man now the anointed people hallelujah christ the mystery the anointed man how many could say jesus was anointed hallelujah he hath anointed me to put up isaiah 61. you know let me just see that for a moment let's just look at the spirit of the lord is upon me and because the lord has anointed me to preach good tidings i got some good news to those who surrender themselves amen he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted how many broken hearted this morning amen he's here to bind you up he's here to proclaim liberty to the captains no long no matter how long you've been bound in sin no matter how long you've had this sickness no no matter it doesn't matter how long how long he has come to what proclaimed liberty hallelujah proclaimed liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound [Applause] to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god and to comfort all that mourn which is first thessalonians 4 wherefore comfort one another with these words but right now we're here in the junction of two the acceptable year for the gentiles is closing out you are getting your last call gentiles amen the day of vengeance of our god is about to start amen but in the middle of all of that he gives a comfort yes to those that mourn hallelujah for those that sign crime because the abomination of the city for those who sin makes them sick to them that this is no longer my home to have sodom all around me [Applause] the perversions of demonic oppression the horrible things that happened our streets and our neighborhoods turned in into to violence but listen now it was the anointed man how many believes that amen put the scripture back up for me amen the spirit of the lord's upon me now brother brethren said now somebody say now up in the mezzanine now or this one over here now oh i don't want you with me now for what he says for the spirit of the lord is upon me and brother branham says the anointed man which we all agree jesus was the anointed man now the anointed people hallelujah now this scripture is your scripture hallelujah the spirit of the lord is upon me how can i preach how can i stand here in this evil age how can i live for god because the spirit of the lord is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach to preach good tidings you can be saved you don't have to be lost you can be healed amen you can cheat death itself hallelujah because we're about to get victory over death so we might as well start getting victory over now hallelujah amen remember he will bruise satan under your feet you have been called in this age to be a serpent bruiser a devil defeater the devils that they flee from you now the anointed people now the spirit of the lord is on me for me to be what anointed me to preach i'm a woman you're a living bible brother branham told us that seoul's in prison now he said you don't know but you little lady with a that little bun on your head that slicked back and peeled like an onion and sitting there that everybody's making fun of you don't they don't know you're the one holding the wrath of god off of this earth it's all because of you that it hadn't all broke into chaos you know why because there's going to be an escape in this day the vengeance is coming but not on you you're going to be pulled out in a moment a twinkling of an eye to be changed and then you're going to be translated to another dimension well brother do you i don't know about this what harold hildebrand was the other day the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom hallelujah why is the anointing to bring back a woman that fits him that the lord has anointed her to be the living word he has sent us to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captain and the opening of the prison to them that are bound next to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord that god's still calling and mercy is still open but the day of vengeance is coming and we're right here on the cusp of it amen it's not going to get better in this world it's about to get worse i'll tell you why because when those feet those feet are pillars of fire which is the bride of christ the body of the earth when she is lifted up from the earth and the feet are taken off the land and the sea and the powers that are there all hell is going to break loose [Applause] do you know why because as we go up satan is cast down you are part of the casting down of satan hallelujah the ultimate casting down of satan himself you that is where you're at you that is your calling you're placing [Applause] right now you can cast them down in your life you have the power within you you have the healing within you you have the miracle within you you have the rapture within you if you've got the holy ghost you've got it all in you hallelujah amen are we still connected amen you know what it is the naughty man now the anointed people oh the man of galilee now he's walking around down the streets of minden hallelujah today he came to church as was his custom [Applause] hallelujah tomorrow he'll go out in the world and what will he do he will turn satan down on every hand he will defeat satan he will abandon have victory and give testimony of the blood of jesus christ and the power of our god is somebody with me hallelujah hallelujah that's exactly the truth hallelujah now the anointed people you are the anointing of the lord and you are anointed forever you are going to destroy the kingdom you are known to be the fire but church hallelujah that's who you are can you say amen can you worship him this morning can you say the lamb is worthy hallelujah the husband has now taken a wife to himself bone of his bone life of his life power of his power and you are youth anointed body [Applause] hallelujah hey just [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah we are here even declaring the day of vengeance upon satan amen we are to climb vengeance over death hell in the grave we are declaring vengeance over cancer we are declaring come on church we are in the day and hour we are declaring vengeance over every devil over every demon power [Applause] [Music] that's a musician [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah what is it is a bride coming into her possession she's possessing her inheritance she knows who she are and who she's called to be thank you jesus thank you lord right now declare vengeance over that devil that's been turned off declare it oh man he is kinsman adventure he'll come on your side you're not in this by yourself you are the anointed people [Applause] the anointed bride of jesus christ that's who you are the son of man personified in human flesh the word in full power that's what that means son of man the word in full power in a bright body thank you lord thank you lord this is where every denomination passes off the scene this is where the focus comes on a bride but this is where there's been churches churches bride ride but there is now a bride on earth who is the word this is not something future this is not another prophet going to come to bring it this is not another move of god is already right here what you've waited on what you've looked on what you believe for is now being manifest in human flesh do you believe it this morning we ought to believe it to all our hearts with everything within us amen i thought i would get through with this today but i'm going to run down to just a little part here for a moment where are we what is happening brother branham would preach what is the attraction on the mountain one time it was christ manifest himself through a prophet bringing the word but where is the attraction now it is changed from the prophet to his prophecy i'm quoting i'm quoting it is changed from the prophet to his prophecy do you realize you are the prophet's prophecy he foresaw a bride coming just like you hallelujah you're looking at your flesh i'm looking at the shady eye that's in you hallelujah i'm looking at the holy ghost being manifested in a bride body and satan knows who you are oh yes satan knows who you are i tell you what you know when we we watched we watched there at youth camp we've seen him display himself here we saw him in a prayer line just the other day a little girl with her arm hideously broken come right back in place we saw him manifest himself in so many different ways even in that prayer line brother derek after three months of not being able to smile his smelling come back that's what he asked for god's here to give you what you need it's within you let your faith rise up to climate are you with me amen we've got so many things that we could speak about just for a moment but i just want to tell i just want to tell the other day because we're we're not going to meet demons we are meeting demons we are not going to be mark 16 in action we are mark 16 in action the spirit of the lord is upon us things are happening expectations are rising faith is building [Applause] somebody's beginning to say there's nothing too hard for the lord [Applause] amen somebody's beginning to judge him faithful not you not your faith not not your weakness but he's faithful we're meeting devils we're casting them out we saw it there on the prayer line what was it about six years ago a demon there when i anointed a young girl you know where it came in through the eye looking at porn she invited the devil to come live with her and it tormented her she comes through the prayer line just on the seemingly you know just just praying maybe a little tear come down walking down eyes closed and i took the oil and anointed her and she turned into a beast she hunts down in her face grotesque and a dark horrible voice growling out of her eye won't come out i won't come out she slept at me every way she could but she could make no connection we had it the other day what was it when you walked in in the room not this time but the other time and when you walked in the room where a devil there had a girl rhythm on the floor what did he say to you he began to scream out when they saw aaron no no no talking about the power that's in the church i loved it the other day you know when at camp when a girl came out with a counselor she's really troubled it was early sunday morning this child young girl one of our campers so full of anxiety and and they and the counselors sought prayer for her and took her outside and met brother joe adams and there he could take encourage her not to fear and was just going to have a short word of prayer for her and he laid his hands on her shoulder and immediately her voice changed and said i don't like you and i'm not coming out those were the words they said listen when the devil says to me i don't like you you don't know the kind of a feeling when the devil says to you i don't like you [Applause] i don't like him either the feeling is mutual devil i don't like you either but i love it when they tell me i don't like you no no no no no not you come on so i don't like you and i'm not coming out growling just a young girl about 13. brother joe just said to the spirit i don't like you either and you're coming out in the name of jesus christ and with it just a simple prayer the girl relaxed and began praising god for her freedom amen you didn't even think pastor for a week it's just a prayer you can listen you can resist the devil and he will what flee from you i'm talking to a people the devil don't like hallelujah the devil don't like no praising around here the devil don't like me glorifying god the devil don't like me preaching messages like this but i'm glad to be a man the devil don't like another fell out in the prayer line was writhing slithering on the floor we had them through the prayer line we didn't learned a thing or two we don't work with them 45 minutes and hold up 400 people we got others to pray for the ushers took her to the back room we recognized it in a demon spirit as it walked out brother ron discerned exactly where the where the problem was in her life where where the devil attached itself wasn't something she did somebody else did it to her don't you realize things you go through many times the devil will try to attach himself to that wound you say i'm going through grief don't let the devil attach say well brother tim my hormones are real high cause i'm in menopause don't let the devil attach to you we're not his slaves we were not ordained to be his slaves he was ordained to be our slave that's why he has to go when we speak their brother joe followed him out we continued the prayer line sister lydia's sister jessica went in there to pray with them it was a real strength and help and they were stranded restraining the girl because otherwise she'd come right out slithering on the platform devil showing out scaring everybody else and packing unbelief you know what they do they come and they sound in your ear because they say i'm not coming out and so they come in there and they attack you right here saying they're gonna they're gonna show you up in the whole front of that whole youth camp they're gonna make a fool out of you comes right in your ear but then you with boldness you meet him i heard your boast now let me tell you who my trust is it's not in me and you might can show me up but you can't show my god up [Applause] hallelujah because my god is showing up and when he shows up he shows out brother joe worked with this girl nearly an hour and she'd come to herself every once in a while and she would cry and help me help me i i want it out i want to be free i i'm so tired and go right back under his control moaning banging her head against the wall literally froth at the mouth these demons are real they push our kids into porn they push them into drinking they push them in the line they begin to push them into cutting themselves hating their own selves even to suicide but they have a right to stay there as long as the sins are unconfessed and unrepented of it doesn't matter the greatest preacher in the world brother branham had a man come and pin his feet to the floor they said is he delivered no he worships that spirit he won't give it up you can worship it and obey it and he can be your god he'll destroy your home your life there's a man up there just just a year ago was delivered of constant drinking he tried everything but what did he do he lost his whole childhood he lost his young adulthood he was a slave to satan all that time but he didn't lose his soul because one moment in the presence of god changed everything hallelujah amen every desire of it went away one moment in the presence of god you say brother tim well i don't like this message well it transforms lives and it makes real daddies and real mothers and nice families and good children and wonderful churches and good people who don't lie and steal why do you hate the message must be the devil in you hating it i don't like the message you know why because the message won't let you be a devil amen amen i'm kind of enjoying this i usually stand two hours you see they have a right to stay there as long as their sins unconfessed and unrepented of you see brother brandon said of a woman who had cheated on her husband hid it all of that lived many years with her husband you know and and it was that secret thing and it began to trouble her the devil found the place you see right there root put her into prison you can be a prisoner to porn prisoner to alcohol prisoner to drugs don't take but one sip it don't take but one smoke it starts with one in the back end of the gable end of the soul all day he said it was there and all the all the all of her days they could pour a gallon of oil on her and kick and stump and cast out devils as much as they wanted to it'll never be able to find the cure till you find the cause and you say well psychology no psychology won't find the cause the cause is sin you find the calls first then you find the cure it was right there i left god it was right there i started disbelieving it was right there at this spot in my life i became friends with this boy and he pulled me out there was more than one demon she'd have a moment of deliverance and another would rise up and finally matthew mcgary came to reinforce and started praying with her began talking with her very strong and as i was leaving the platform we prayed for 400 people brother donnie was limp we barely got him in the car me i stood there for four hours praying for people i was exhausted and as i walked by the room i just pointed and i said god let them find what it is that's holding her from deliverance and at that very moment she began to repent of all the things that were holding her and when she repented it came out her countenance changed her speech changed the moaning cease the writhing stopped everything else stopped she was at peace amen the smile come over her face the freedom began hallelujah why because men are anointed we have been anointed give freedom to those that are in prison we are here anointed in this day and hour to stand for truth and righteousness we are the word bride we are the word pride say it with me we are the word pride we're the word made flesh it was made blessed 2 000 years ago but now it has been manifested in the fullness of its power else and i is in a body else and i is inner church it's the baptism of the holy ghost and you've been filled with it give praise to god right now [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] lord we come
