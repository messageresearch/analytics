[21:28] preeminence. Father, I pray right now
[21:30] that every hindrance, every thought,
[21:32] everything that would try to keep us

[21:37] the Holy Spirit, Lord, we're here to
[21:39] give you our everything, Lord. Lord, to

[21:50] of you today, Lord. I'm asking you to
[21:52] come now, Father, and speak, Lord. I

[21:56] I pray every part of this service will
[21:58] bring you glory today. Lord, we're
[22:00] remembering today our brothers and
[22:02] sisters, Lord, those that are suffering,
[22:04] those that are sick, Lord. Lord, we

[22:08] Ben, both needing a touch in their body,
[22:10] Father. Lord, I'm praying today that
[22:12] you'll just come by and show yourself,
[22:14] Lord, as healer once again. Lord, you've
[22:16] done it so many times, Lord, and we know
[22:18] without a shadow of a doubt, Lord, that
[22:20] the stripes you took still atone and
[22:23] still heal, Father. And I'm just asking
[22:25] that you'll do it today, Lord. For those
[22:27] that can't be here and would love to be,
[22:29] I just pray, Lord, that your spirit go
[22:31] wherever they are. Lord, you're not
[22:33] contained by walls or time or space, but
[22:36] wherever they're at today, Lord, may you
[22:38] just go by and be their portion, Father.
[22:40] Lord, we're asking for a portion today.
[22:42] We're asking for a handful on purpose.
[22:45] We're asking that you'll anoint our ears
[22:46] and anoint the words that come forth,
[22:48] Father. Lord, that we can be drawn
[22:50] closer to you here in the closing
[22:52] moments of time. Lord, we just commit it
[22:54] all to your hands, Lord. Every song,
[22:57] every special, Lord. Lord, as the word
[22:59] would come forth, I pray it be anointed,
[23:01] Lord God, and that it'll find its mark
[23:03] as it always does. And Father, when it
[23:05] finds that mark, I pray it be received,
[23:08] Lord, Lord, and take it into the lives
[23:10] today of your children. Lord, we love
[23:12] you. We thank you, and we just ask you

[59:39] way. I pray today, Lord, that as we look

[59:45] God, that we can all make our call and

[1:00:39] the prayers of your children and the

[1:00:59] to the Lord today. thankful for you
[1:01:02] being here together and for the presence
[1:01:04] of the Lord. Uh we just had a wonderful
[1:01:08] song service as we worship the Lord
[1:01:10] together. We want to just now look into
[1:01:13] the word. Let the word of God stir our
[1:01:16] hearts
[1:01:17] today. And um if you um if you will,
[1:01:21] excuse me, you can uh prepare the slides
[1:01:24] that I have uh today because um we're
[1:01:27] going to do we're going to just kind of
[1:01:29] go a little different direction than
[1:01:31] what we've been doing. And we uh we're
[1:01:34] going to to kind of um take some
[1:01:38] thoughts today and um just do a little
[1:01:41] bit of teaching instead of preaching.
[1:01:44] And so this is Sunday and it'll be our
[1:01:46] Sunday school lesson today as we just
[1:01:49] look into the word of God. And at the
[1:01:51] end of the service with the Dunn family
[1:01:54] has their daughter Rain that's going to
[1:01:57] be baptized today in the wonderful name
[1:01:59] of the Lord Jesus Christ. What a
[1:02:02] privilege that is that she has chosen to
[1:02:06] serve the Lord. Amen. That would be the
[1:02:08] answer to any mother's prayer. I know.
[1:02:11] Amen. God bless you. Today we're going
[1:02:14] to be speaking today on um on on modern
[1:02:18] events made clear by prophecy as we uh
[1:02:21] just look at some of the events that are
[1:02:24] taking place and the day and the hour
[1:02:26] that we're living in. And we would want
[1:02:28] to see the word of God made clear and
[1:02:31] and and uh and see what has been
[1:02:35] promised and prophesied for this hour.
[1:02:38] And of course, there's been a lot of
[1:02:40] things in the last few days that you're
[1:02:42] all all aware in the news, but I just
[1:02:44] kind of wanted to cap it off today and
[1:02:46] and speak about it. If um you don't
[1:02:49] mind, we just go into the scriptures and
[1:02:52] look and see where we are in the word of
[1:02:55] God. And uh of course, we've been
[1:02:57] speaking on the mountain movers where
[1:03:00] that he says, "Who art thou, oh great
[1:03:02] mountain? Thou shalt become a plain and
[1:03:05] the headstone shall be brought forth
[1:03:07] with shoutings, crying grace, grace unto
[1:03:10] it. And we got to keep our eyes on the
[1:03:12] promise. When we see trouble in the
[1:03:14] land, when we see prophecy coming to
[1:03:16] pass, we want to remember we're also in
[1:03:19] the prophecy. And the prophecy is the
[1:03:23] mountains are going to be moved. Amen.
[1:03:26] You know, even things that looks like
[1:03:28] it's impossible for it to happen, it's
[1:03:31] going to happen anyway. Amen. Because
[1:03:35] mountains will be moved. And and of
[1:03:38] course then it shall be brought the
[1:03:40] headstone will come forth with shoutings
[1:03:43] crying grace, grace. So it's the
[1:03:45] absolute favor of God that is upon this
[1:03:49] generation, upon us today. So, as we
[1:03:52] look into this, I want to turn to
[1:03:54] Revelation chapter 12, and we will read
[1:03:57] from the first verse. You might want to
[1:04:00] keep your Bible handy. I may have a
[1:04:03] scripture that I refer to that won't be
[1:04:05] in the slides, but but Revelation 12 and
[1:04:09] verse 1. And there appeared a great
[1:04:12] wonder in heaven, a woman clothed with
[1:04:14] the sun, the moon under her feet, and
[1:04:17] upon her head a crown of 12 stars. And
[1:04:20] she being with with
[1:04:23] child travailing in birth, pain to be
[1:04:26] delivered. And there appeared another
[1:04:29] wonder in heaven. And behold, a great
[1:04:32] red dragon having seven heads and 10
[1:04:34] horns and seven crowns upon his
[1:04:38] heads. And his tail drew the third part
[1:04:42] of the stars of heaven. And it cast him
[1:04:45] to the earth. And the dragon stood
[1:04:47] before the woman which was ready to be
[1:04:49] delivered for to devour her child as
[1:04:52] soon as it was
[1:04:56] born all nations with a rod of iron. And
[1:05:00] her child was caught up in unto God into
[1:05:03] his
[1:05:04] throne. And the woman fled into the
[1:05:07] wilderness where she hath the place
[1:05:09] prepared of God that they should feed
[1:05:12] her there
[1:05:13] a,23 score days. God bless you. You can
[1:05:16] be seated. Now, as I said, we're going
[1:05:19] to be switching focus today to some
[1:05:22] modern events that are actually have
[1:05:25] been prophesied of the time, the day
[1:05:28] that we're living in. And of course, we
[1:05:30] have read in this prophecy where we
[1:05:33] instead of seeing a man on the moon, we
[1:05:35] see a woman on the moon. And um she as
[1:05:39] the Bible said that there appeared a
[1:05:42] great wonder in heaven, a woman clothed
[1:05:46] with the sun and a moon under her feet
[1:05:49] and upon her crown head a crown of 12
[1:05:53] stars. So here is the woman that is
[1:05:56] depicted. Now remember the book of
[1:05:59] revelation is a symbolic book and so
[1:06:03] it's all in parabolic form and of course
[1:06:07] we have to understand then what is given
[1:06:10] for us to know because it is given to us
[1:06:13] to know the mysteries of the kingdom and
[1:06:16] of course in this day the book of
[1:06:18] revelation really becomes our book. It
[1:06:21] becomes made known to us in our day. And
[1:06:24] so this woman is clothed um there with
[1:06:28] the with the sun which is the light of
[1:06:31] the gospel. It is grace. The moon is
[1:06:35] under her feet which was the law. For
[1:06:38] the law is a shadow or a reflection of
[1:06:41] better things to come. And upon her head
[1:06:45] is a crown of 12 stars which are um you
[1:06:48] know the 12 patriarchs of course as you
[1:06:50] know in the old testament and the new
[1:06:53] it's reflected in the book of revelation
[1:06:56] as it talks about those before the
[1:06:58] throne which are the four and the 20
[1:07:00] elders. So the 4 and 20 is 24. And so
[1:07:04] that is 12 of the Old Testament, 12 of
[1:07:06] the New Testament, 12 patriarchs, 12
[1:07:09] apostles. And so the reason why this is
[1:07:12] important is is that in a in
[1:07:16] a Israel reflects um the the true bride
[1:07:21] of Christ because she was the bride of
[1:07:24] the old covenant. And now we come into
[1:07:27] the new covenant where God has called a
[1:07:29] people out of the Gentiles for his
[1:07:32] name's sake. And so in all in in all
[1:07:36] actuality that that um they both are
[1:07:40] reflected in this prophecy because not
[1:07:45] only is um she having 12 patriarchs but
[1:07:50] in her complete deliverance, she will
[1:07:54] also have revealed to her the 12
[1:07:56] apostles which are of course um those
[1:07:59] that have been spoke of and called by
[1:08:02] Jesus and they they are part of the New
[1:08:05] Testament church. So she is there
[1:08:08] clothed with the sun, the gospel of
[1:08:10] grace. The moon is under her feet which
[1:08:13] is the law. It's a shadow of better
[1:08:15] things to come. There's a 12 uh crown of
[1:08:18] 12 stars of 12 patriarchs. And uh which
[1:08:22] shows her completeness. And here's
[1:08:25] what's important. She she gives a she
[1:08:29] actually has gives birth to a male child
[1:08:33] which is Jesus Christ. Now I want you to
[1:08:36] remember Israel is is was in a place
[1:08:40] 2,000 years ago where the woman Israel
[1:08:44] was expecting a Messiah. She was looking
[1:08:48] for the Christ to come. We are here in
[1:08:52] this day. She was reflecting us and we
[1:08:55] are people also who are under
[1:08:57] expectation.
[1:08:58] We are looking for our Messiah for
[1:09:01] Christ to come. So again we have in this
[1:09:05] last day a bride who is an expectant
[1:09:09] people looking for the Messiah. And of
[1:09:12] course as you know even in the first
[1:09:14] coming of Christ there was a forerunner
[1:09:17] that was given which was Elijah who was
[1:09:20] John the Baptist the messenger prepared
[1:09:22] before his face. So we see then also
[1:09:25] that we would have again Elijah the
[1:09:28] prophet to come in the last days to
[1:09:31] forrun the second coming of the Lord. So
[1:09:34] you can see it's a real parallel and
[1:09:36] Israel is a type of the church and and
[1:09:40] the church is a continuation and
[1:09:42] fulfillment of Old Testament types. So
[1:09:45] you say, "Well, Old Testament doesn't
[1:09:47] even apply to us." Oh, yes it does. We
[1:09:49] are the fulfillment of the law and the
[1:09:52] prophets. And so again, the summary is
[1:09:56] is the sun is the glory of God, the
[1:09:58] grace brought by the gospel. The moon is
[1:10:01] dominion over the law that's now at her
[1:10:04] feet. And then the 12 stars, which is
[1:10:06] the divine order of the 12 tribes in the
[1:10:10] New Testament, 12 apostles. She gives
[1:10:11] birth to a male child, which is Jesus
[1:10:14] Christ. Now, in contrast, there is
[1:10:18] another woman in the book of Revelation
[1:10:21] that is also a part of end time
[1:10:24] prophecy. So, we're going to look at
[1:10:28] this as well. And if you will see here
[1:10:31] there the Bible said then one of the
[1:10:34] seven angels who had the seven bowls or
[1:10:37] vials came and talked with me saying
[1:10:39] come and I will show you the judgment of
[1:10:42] the great harlot who sits upon many
[1:10:46] waters with whom the kings of the earth
[1:10:49] has committed fornications and the
[1:10:51] inhabitants of the earth were made drunk
[1:10:54] with the wine of her fornication. So he
[1:10:56] carried me away in the spirit into the
[1:11:00] wilderness and I saw a woman sitting on
[1:11:03] a scarlet colored beast who which was
[1:11:06] full of names of
[1:11:08] blasphemy. Watch now. And and she has
[1:11:12] seven heads and 10 horns. And of course
[1:11:15] the seven heads in the Bible are the
[1:11:17] seven heels upon which she sits. And
[1:11:20] notice she has names full of blasphemy
[1:11:24] because why is it blasphemous names?
[1:11:27] Because when you take on a name that is
[1:11:31] different from the that of your husband,
[1:11:34] the bridegroom Jesus Christ, that is
[1:11:37] names of blasphemy. It is a names of
[1:11:40] blasphemy to be called by any
[1:11:43] denominational name.
[1:11:45] We are to be called by the name of Jesus
[1:11:48] Christ. So she had she was a woman on a
[1:11:52] scarlet colored beast and she had what
[1:11:54] had names full of blasphemy or full of
[1:11:57] names of blasphemy. And so so again the
[1:12:02] Bible describes her as a woman was
[1:12:04] arrayed in scarlet. She's adorned with
[1:12:07] gold and precious stones and pearls
[1:12:09] having in her hand a cup of full of
[1:12:13] abominations and the filthiness of her
[1:12:16] fornications. And on her forehead was a
[1:12:19] name written mystery Babylon the great,
[1:12:23] the mother of harlots and the
[1:12:25] abominations of the earth. Now what a
[1:12:27] mother's day that is
[1:12:30] because I want you to notice she didn't
[1:12:32] write her name here. God has marked her
[1:12:37] and he has named her as mystery babel.
[1:12:41] So she is associated with a city, you
[1:12:46] know, that that was before her which was
[1:12:48] full of paganism
[1:12:51] and idolatry. And now that same idolatry
[1:12:54] is now in that church. And so she is
[1:12:58] mystery Babylon the great, the mother of
[1:13:02] harlots. Now notice she is a mother. So
[1:13:05] she has daughters and her daughters are
[1:13:09] those who were born out of her. Those
[1:13:12] who were born out of her are also
[1:13:14] harlots because they also did not stay
[1:13:17] true to the word took in the seeds of
[1:13:19] other men that was not her husband Jesus
[1:13:22] Christ. And this makes her as the Bible
[1:13:25] calls her the great He calls her
[1:13:28] the mother of harlots. So he identifies
[1:13:32] these denominational systems as the the
[1:13:37] horror and out of her coming daughters
[1:13:40] which she has given birth to and out of
[1:13:43] her came Methodist, Baptist,
[1:13:45] Presbyterian, Catholic, all of these
[1:13:47] names of blasphemy. Amen. I want you to
[1:13:51] understand because to call yourself to
[1:13:54] take on any other name that for
[1:13:57] salvation than the name of Jesus Christ
[1:13:59] is blasphemy.
[1:14:01] That's right. And then he said, he goes
[1:14:04] on to describe her and said, I saw the
[1:14:06] woman and she's actually drunk with the
[1:14:10] blood of the saints and with the blood
[1:14:13] of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw
[1:14:17] her, I marveled or I was greatly amazed.
[1:14:22] I was amazed at this woman as I looked
[1:14:24] at her. Now here he he said she is drunk
[1:14:28] with the blood of the saints. Now just
[1:14:31] just in martyology, there are 68 million
[1:14:37] that she has slaughtered down to the
[1:14:39] ages. And I'll tell you, she's never
[1:14:42] repented of it.
[1:14:45] Amen. The Bible even said in Revelation
[1:14:47] chapter nine that she would not repent
[1:14:50] of her of her fornications and her
[1:14:53] idolatry and her murders and and neither
[1:14:56] um you know her given over to idolatry.
[1:14:59] She would never repent of it. So she
[1:15:02] she'll not repent. You can't reform her.
[1:15:07] Amen. Come on. Reformations have tried
[1:15:09] down to the ages. They've had to trying
[1:15:12] to reform the church and all it produced
[1:15:15] was another harlot system. That's why in
[1:15:18] this day we had to have a restoration,
[1:15:22] not a reformation. That's right. Now,
[1:15:25] this is very important so that we
[1:15:27] understand. You see, so this second
[1:15:29] woman in Revelation 17 is a harlot on
[1:15:32] the beast. She symbolizes false
[1:15:35] religion.
[1:15:36] She symbolizes spiritual adultery.
[1:15:40] All right. Doctrines that are contrary
[1:15:43] to the word apostasy and persecution.
[1:15:46] She sits on a scarlet beast which is
[1:15:50] political and demonic power. And you
[1:15:53] look at her, she controls billions
[1:15:55] around the world. They want to talk
[1:15:56] about a, you know, a bunch of cult
[1:15:59] people, people following this cult, you
[1:16:02] know, of a prophet and and you know that
[1:16:04] there maybe a million or so of them
[1:16:06] across the earth. Listen, this one here
[1:16:09] is a a man who is worshiped and adored
[1:16:14] as a as a very presence of Jesus Christ
[1:16:17] on earth and and there he is controlling
[1:16:21] over 1 billion people upon the earth.
[1:16:24] That's right. So I want to ask you,
[1:16:26] who's the cult?
[1:16:29] Amen. And look what she has a she has
[1:16:33] dressed in purple and scarlet worldly
[1:16:36] royalty and seduction and riches. She
[1:16:39] has a gold cup in her hand that is full
[1:16:42] of of her fornication. It's the wine.
[1:16:45] It's false doctrines. It's creeds of
[1:16:47] men. And not only that, she's drunk with
[1:16:50] the blood of the saints. So she brings
[1:16:52] religious persecution.
[1:16:55] And I want you to remember even though
[1:16:58] we have come through horrible times in
[1:17:00] this day and and you'd think it would
[1:17:02] all be passed like the Holocaust where
[1:17:04] there was millions of people killed. Um
[1:17:07] but I I want you to remember religious
[1:17:09] persecution is not over.
[1:17:15] It is not over. And in fact of the
[1:17:18] matter is it's about to turn loose
[1:17:23] because the protections we have enjoyed
[1:17:25] even in in America is fast fastly fading
[1:17:29] away. Amen. So now as we look at this, I
[1:17:34] want you just to to get this now um as
[1:17:38] we look at this false religion. It's um
[1:17:42] it so so here in this this false
[1:17:45] religion here as we're talking about it,
[1:17:48] it's spiritual adultery. It's corrupt
[1:17:51] religious systems that are in absolute
[1:17:54] rebellion against God.
[1:17:56] And so it's it's often tied to Babylon
[1:18:00] as it's called mystery Babylon. It's not
[1:18:02] Babylon, but the same mysteries of
[1:18:04] Babylon come in her and and mixes
[1:18:07] paganism with the gospel making a hybrid
[1:18:10] religion.
[1:18:12] So again, says we we see her condition.
[1:18:16] She deceives the people. She opposes
[1:18:19] God's true people and she is a symbol of
[1:18:22] aposty and world power and and
[1:18:26] persecution. Now I want to show you
[1:18:29] another woman as we are looking in at
[1:18:32] this and I want to show you another
[1:18:35] woman and she is the
[1:18:37] counterpart or the parallel to this
[1:18:40] woman on the moon. Now the woman on the
[1:18:42] moon is Israel.
[1:18:44] But here I want you to remember she was
[1:18:47] reflecting also are paralleling or
[1:18:51] speaking of another woman to come and
[1:18:54] that woman would be the bride of Jesus
[1:18:56] Christ. So let me show you her. She is
[1:19:00] called the bride, the lamb's wife.
[1:19:03] And so in and so here it says um let me
[1:19:08] see
[1:19:09] if let me see
[1:19:14] here. Let me just read this part of the
[1:19:16] scripture there as we look at it.
[1:19:19] Um I have slipped down in my in my
[1:19:24] notes.
[1:19:25] Sorry. So as we as we look at her in her
[1:19:29] condition, she she is the brides, the
[1:19:34] lamb's wife that is called and it says,
[1:19:37] "Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:19:40] honor to him. Give him glory for the
[1:19:43] marriage of the lamb has come and his
[1:19:45] wife hath made herself ready." Now
[1:19:48] listen church. No matter what, God's
[1:19:51] going to have a people.
[1:19:54] Amen. God's going to have the people.
[1:19:56] That's going to be the end result. God
[1:19:57] will have a bride.
[1:20:00] No matter what the world does, no matter
[1:20:02] how Satan comes against us, God's going
[1:20:05] to have a bride. She has prophesied of
[1:20:09] the coming of a woman who would make
[1:20:12] herself prepared to meet the bridegroom.
[1:20:15] Amen. So he said, "And to her was
[1:20:19] granted that she should be arrayed in
[1:20:22] fine linen, clean and white, for the
[1:20:24] fine linen is the righteous acts of the
[1:20:27] saints." Now, I want to get this to you.
[1:20:30] I I I want you to see what she would be
[1:20:32] dressed in. She will actually take on
[1:20:35] the clothes of the righteous acts of all
[1:20:40] of the elect down through the ages.
[1:20:43] Amen. Amen. She will wear the garment of
[1:20:47] the faith of Abraham.
[1:20:50] Come on. She will actually be the Sarah,
[1:20:54] the Rebecca, the Esther.
[1:20:57] She will be she will actually dress
[1:20:59] herself in all of the words that
[1:21:02] prophesied of her. So she will be
[1:21:06] arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright.
[1:21:10] For the fine linen is the righteous acts
[1:21:13] of the saints, not their failures.
[1:21:16] Amen.
[1:21:18] But their righteous acts.
[1:21:22] Amen. Oh, I tell you this morning, we
[1:21:24] talking about putting on the whole armor
[1:21:26] of God. We ought to put on the faith of
[1:21:28] Abraham.
[1:21:29] The faith of Enoch.
[1:21:32] Amen. The faith of men of God down
[1:21:34] through the ages who stood for the word
[1:21:36] of truth. Put it on. Amen. Now, you
[1:21:39] know, this was not just preached to you
[1:21:42] so that you could see it in their lives.
[1:21:44] It's so you could take that apparel and
[1:21:47] put it on your own self. Dress yourself
[1:21:50] in that very faith. Yes. So he says,
[1:21:53] "And to her, to her was granted that she
[1:21:55] should be arrayed." Verse nine. And then
[1:21:57] he said unto me, write blessed are they
[1:22:00] that are called to the marry supper of
[1:22:02] the lamb and says these are the true
[1:22:05] sayings of God because the true word of
[1:22:08] God is being made manifest in bride
[1:22:10] form.
[1:22:13] And I'll just say this morning, these
[1:22:16] are the true sayings of God.
[1:22:19] Here's the word being made flesh.
[1:22:22] That's the age the hour that we're
[1:22:23] living in. That in a day where men and
[1:22:27] women are actually taking on the very
[1:22:30] spirits from hell, here's a people that
[1:22:33] are taking on the very garments sir of
[1:22:36] the saints before them and dressed in
[1:22:39] the same righteous acts believe in the
[1:22:42] word of God. Amen. Now, so then again,
[1:22:47] Revelation 21:9, then one of the seven
[1:22:50] angels who had the seven bowls or vials
[1:22:53] filled with the seven last plagues came
[1:22:55] to me and talked with me and said,
[1:22:57] "Come, I will show you the bride, the
[1:23:00] lamb's wife." Now, I want to say
[1:23:02] something about this. One of the seven
[1:23:05] angels, do you realize this was a man?
[1:23:11] Amen. Later on in the scripture, John
[1:23:14] would go to to worship him. He said,
[1:23:16] "Don't do it. I'm a prophet."
[1:23:19] So he actually now he actually sees in
[1:23:23] the vision a prophet coming to him. And
[1:23:27] this prophet says, "Come here. I want to
[1:23:30] show you the bride, the lamb's wife."
[1:23:35] Hallelujah. Do you realize that's
[1:23:38] exactly where we are in the vision?
[1:23:41] Amen. In the book of Revelation, we are
[1:23:43] in that vision where the bride is come
[1:23:47] on display.
[1:23:50] A people for his name's sake.
[1:23:53] Amen. And notice now how he gets to do
[1:23:56] it. He He carries me away in the spirit
[1:23:59] because you're not going to see nothing
[1:24:01] until you get in the spirit. Amen.
[1:24:04] This is why that we've been preaching
[1:24:06] about atmosphere and and having the
[1:24:09] right atmosphere and getting in the
[1:24:11] spirit and all of these things is
[1:24:13] because you're not going to see anything
[1:24:15] till you get in the spirit.
[1:24:18] Amen. And he said he carried me away to
[1:24:21] a high mountain and showed me the great
[1:24:23] city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out
[1:24:27] of heaven from God, having the glory of
[1:24:30] God. And her white was a a most precious
[1:24:33] stone like jasper stone clear as
[1:24:38] crystal. Listen, when brother Bradam
[1:24:40] talked about that sea as clear as
[1:24:43] crystal, he said it represents all sin
[1:24:46] is gone,
[1:24:49] washed in the blood, totally annihilated
[1:24:52] till it's clear as crystal.
[1:24:56] So the glory of God that she has was a
[1:25:00] light like a most precious stone, clear
[1:25:04] as crystal. We're talking about the
[1:25:06] bride glorified.
[1:25:09] Amen. And we're in the day where God Oh,
[1:25:12] after there's been churches and churches
[1:25:14] and brides, brides, here comes the real
[1:25:16] one that the others were only
[1:25:19] reflecting.
[1:25:21] Amen. So as we look at this, we we see
[1:25:25] that this third woman here, she she
[1:25:29] reflects the church in glory, glorified,
[1:25:33] redeemed, united with Christ. She she's
[1:25:37] described as a bride adorned for her
[1:25:40] husband, made ready for the marriage
[1:25:43] supper of the Lamb, arrayed in fine
[1:25:46] linen, clean and white, the
[1:25:47] righteousness of the saints. She's she's
[1:25:51] revealed as not mystery Babylon.
[1:25:56] Amen. The other woman's associated with
[1:25:58] a an ancient city.
[1:26:01] But this one is a new Jerusalem.
[1:26:04] Amen. Which is the dwelling place of
[1:26:07] God. Can't you see? He says, "This bride
[1:26:10] is my dwelling place."
[1:26:13] These are the people I have chosen to
[1:26:16] dwell in.
[1:26:18] Hallelujah. Amen. Isn't that awesome
[1:26:21] to know here right in the scripture we
[1:26:24] have been placed, you know, where as a
[1:26:27] bride ready for I ready for marriage. I
[1:26:30] don't care where you are in your walk
[1:26:32] right now. Amen. Look toward the promise
[1:26:34] and take another step.
[1:26:37] Is that right? If you're falling short
[1:26:39] today, take another step. Amen. If you
[1:26:42] look like there's a lack in your life,
[1:26:44] remember he's going to make you ready.
[1:26:46] And the bride has made herself ready. So
[1:26:48] put it on.
[1:26:51] Amen. Now, so again, you see this is
[1:26:54] this is a role. It's the redeemed
[1:26:57] church, the dwelling place of God among
[1:27:00] his people. A people who are in perfect
[1:27:03] communion with Christ.
[1:27:05] So this this woman is totally different
[1:27:09] than that other LWD woman we just saw
[1:27:12] who is drunk with the blood of saints.
[1:27:15] She instead is in communion with
[1:27:19] Christ. Now she is the dwelling place of
[1:27:22] God. So as we look at here and I just
[1:27:26] kind of summarize this, you know, here
[1:27:28] we take this woman. Now in Revelation
[1:27:31] 12, the woman is clothed with the sun.
[1:27:33] Revelation
[1:27:36] um she she is Israel in Revelation 12.
[1:27:40] Revelation 17, that's the great harlot,
[1:27:43] Babylon, mystery Babylon the great. Now,
[1:27:45] Revelation 19 and 21, the bride, the
[1:27:48] lamb's wife. The first one represents
[1:27:51] God's covenant people, Israel. Secondly,
[1:27:54] the second one represents the apostate
[1:27:57] religion and world system. Now, church,
[1:28:00] if you got you got to realize we're in
[1:28:03] the end time where the it's going to be
[1:28:05] so close, it would deceive the very
[1:28:08] elect. We can't just be religious
[1:28:10] people.
[1:28:12] Amen. We We've got to have the right
[1:28:14] thing because there is an apostate
[1:28:16] religion and a world system.
[1:28:21] And then there is but there is another
[1:28:23] woman who is representing the raptured
[1:28:26] church.
[1:28:28] Amen. So here we are the represented in
[1:28:32] the scripture is a people who are caught
[1:28:34] up. Amen. Now look, the clothing of of
[1:28:38] Revelation 12 woman is the sun, the
[1:28:40] moon, the 12 stars. The clothing of the
[1:28:43] Revelation 17 is purple, scarlet, gold,
[1:28:46] and jewels. She's a worldly woman, rich,
[1:28:49] increased with goods. Revelation 19,
[1:28:53] fine linen, clean and white. The
[1:28:56] righteous acts of the saints. Let me ask
[1:28:58] you, how are you dressed?
[1:29:02] Look at the role of that. If one brings
[1:29:04] Christ into the world, she gave birth to
[1:29:07] the Messiah. The second one persecutes
[1:29:10] the saints and deceives the whole world.
[1:29:15] The last one here, the bride, the lamb's
[1:29:17] wife, is one married, united with Christ
[1:29:21] forever.
[1:29:25] So one of them in the relationship, you
[1:29:27] know, is a mother of the Messiah,
[1:29:29] Israel, opposed to Christ, the great
[1:29:32] harlot, married to Christ, the bride.
[1:29:35] See the women in the Bible. Those are
[1:29:38] the mothers.
[1:29:40] Amen. And look at the end. We'll see in
[1:29:43] Revelation 12, they're protected and
[1:29:46] delivered. We see the one in Revelation
[1:29:48] 17, judged and destroyed. will see the
[1:29:51] bride, the lamb's wife will dwell with
[1:29:53] God eternally.
[1:29:57] So look where God has placed you. Look
[1:30:00] the calling that he has given you in the
[1:30:02] word. So now as we look at here, you
[1:30:07] know, this in these these key symbols
[1:30:10] now that we're going to look at here in
[1:30:13] Revelation 12, we're going to look
[1:30:15] through verse um 2-6 now in our next
[1:30:18] slides. And just as an overview, we'll
[1:30:21] see a woman with child as Israel.
[1:30:23] There'll be a manchild, Jesus Christ.
[1:30:24] There will be the dragon uh which will
[1:30:27] be Satan. There will be t the um tail
[1:30:30] which is lies and deception. There will
[1:30:33] be the third part of the stars of fallen
[1:30:35] angels and demonic spirits and Herod and
[1:30:38] Rome which will be Satan's earthly
[1:30:41] agent. So let's look into that real
[1:30:43] quick. And she being with
[1:30:47] child, she cried travailing in birth.
[1:30:51] She was pained to be
[1:30:55] delivered. And there appears another
[1:30:58] wonder in heaven. Now here the scene
[1:31:00] changes. You have this woman Israel.
[1:31:03] She's about to give birth. Right here is
[1:31:06] she's about to give birth. Satan's
[1:31:08] there.
[1:31:11] What? And here he comes. is a great red
[1:31:14] dragon having seven heads, 10 horns, and
[1:31:16] seven crowns upon his
[1:31:19] heads. And we ask, who is this dragon?
[1:31:22] Revelation 12 says, verse 9 says, "And
[1:31:25] the dragon was cast out, that old
[1:31:27] serpent called the devil and Satan." So
[1:31:30] that's who he is. And look what he did.
[1:31:34] His his tail drew the third part of the
[1:31:38] stars of heaven and it cast them to the
[1:31:42] earth. So this this is his whole job is
[1:31:44] to deceive the world but not only do
[1:31:47] that but deceive angels.
[1:31:51] Now you see he was could we say one of
[1:31:56] the first preachers. Sure.
[1:31:59] He preached to angels and deceived them.
[1:32:01] He come and preach to Eve and deceive
[1:32:03] man. He's still preaching today
[1:32:07] in pullpits across the world. The Bible
[1:32:10] tells you that he would be worshiped
[1:32:12] instead of God. That when you really
[1:32:15] pull the mask off of the man of sin, it
[1:32:17] would not be Jesus Christ. It would be
[1:32:19] worshiping. It would be the man of sin.
[1:32:23] Now, so here we are now. You know this
[1:32:25] the tale in the scripture. Brother
[1:32:27] Brandham said it was not the t a l it
[1:32:32] was the t a l e that he told.
[1:32:37] Now tail in the scripture is symbolic of
[1:32:42] lies and manipulation. In Isaiah 9:15,
[1:32:45] you can put this down. The prophet
[1:32:47] teaches lies. He is the
[1:32:50] tale. So you see, he uses cunning,
[1:32:53] deceit, twisted words to lead others
[1:32:57] astray. And the Bible said, "And he did
[1:33:00] cast them to the earth." And these
[1:33:02] fallen angels become demons. Amen. And
[1:33:07] even sickness
[1:33:10] and they're now active in spiritual
[1:33:13] warfare against the church and and
[1:33:16] opposing God's purposes on earth. And
[1:33:18] this is why the Bible tells you you've
[1:33:20] got to you've got to arm yourself and
[1:33:24] put on the whole armor of God because
[1:33:26] you're going to be facing the adversary
[1:33:30] and the host of hell in this last day
[1:33:32] and especially in this last day. Amen.
[1:33:35] Because this is even when reinforcements
[1:33:38] come from the river Euphrates as you
[1:33:40] know where there are millions more that
[1:33:42] are released and and the Bible tells you
[1:33:46] that that the the dragon stood before
[1:33:50] the
[1:33:53] woman and and to devour her child. Now
[1:33:56] remember this was Rome and she was
[1:33:59] standing there. So right there, I want
[1:34:01] you to get this. Before Jesus was even
[1:34:05] born, Satan has made his move, he's in
[1:34:09] place, too.
[1:34:13] Remember this. This is the way it's
[1:34:15] going to be in the end time. Before
[1:34:17] Jesus comes, before the rapture of the
[1:34:20] church, Satan is gonna be there, too.
[1:34:25] And fact of the matter is when the when
[1:34:27] the bride goes up, he will be full king
[1:34:30] of the earth.
[1:34:34] You don't want to be here when that
[1:34:35] happens
[1:34:37] because right now he has limited power.
[1:34:41] But then his power will be unleashed
[1:34:44] because he has but a short season and he
[1:34:46] hath great wrath.
[1:34:49] So you see here again, she brought forth
[1:34:52] a manchild, which is Jesus Christ, who
[1:34:54] was to rule all nations with a rod of
[1:34:56] iron, and her child was raptured up to
[1:34:59] God and to his throne. Now, let's stop
[1:35:01] just for a minute and explain this
[1:35:03] because he was to bring the millennium.
[1:35:07] He was to come as a king.
[1:35:10] He was to to bring peace on earth and
[1:35:15] good will to man, right? But being
[1:35:19] rejected there, you see, and and the
[1:35:22] whole nation of Israel turned against
[1:35:24] him. And here he was he was he was
[1:35:28] crucified, rose again, and and caught up
[1:35:31] to God and to his throne. So he was
[1:35:33] raptured up. So that's what happened in
[1:35:35] that rapture. Now, so Jesus was the male
[1:35:40] child and and he was born of Israel,
[1:35:43] destined to rule, caught up to God in an
[1:35:45] ascension. And because Israel rejected
[1:35:49] the gospel, it has postponed the
[1:35:53] millennial reign.
[1:35:57] So they were asking him, Lord, will you
[1:35:59] restore the kingdom at this time? They
[1:36:01] wanted the kingdom. That's what they was
[1:36:03] looking for. And he said, you know,
[1:36:04] again, the because of rejection of the
[1:36:07] Messiah, the kingdom is postponed for
[1:36:11] seven gentile church ages and the bride
[1:36:14] begins. And this is not even seen in
[1:36:16] Revelation 12 because we're dealing with
[1:36:18] that nation Israel in this
[1:36:20] vision. So, so God God does not show
[1:36:26] here that a time gap between these
[1:36:31] scriptures. So we look at this next
[1:36:33] verse begins, "And the woman fled into
[1:36:37] the wilderness." So I want you to see
[1:36:38] between verse five and six is 2,000
[1:36:42] years of gentile church ages that are
[1:36:46] not shown in this vision because it
[1:36:49] don't pertain. It just picks up again
[1:36:52] what in the end time when the woman will
[1:36:55] flee to the wilderness. Amen. All right.
[1:36:59] Now, this happens at the end times. That
[1:37:01] happened. The other happened 2,000 years
[1:37:03] ago. Now, then between five and six are
[1:37:07] seven gentile churches and they're not
[1:37:10] even shown. Amen. So, we jump right over
[1:37:14] into verse six. And the woman fled in
[1:37:16] the wilderness where she has a place
[1:37:20] prepared of God. I want you to get this
[1:37:23] because he's got a place for you, too.
[1:37:25] Amen. I go to prepare a place for you.
[1:37:32] But here Israel has a place also.
[1:37:38] And she fled into the wilderness. This
[1:37:40] was a condition of the land of Israel, a
[1:37:44] forgotten and mostly barren land until
[1:37:47] the Jews fled. Watch this. fled from all
[1:37:51] over the world into this prepared place
[1:37:55] and Israel is reathered into her land in
[1:37:58] modern times where she has been nursed
[1:38:01] by God. Let me tell you friends, if you
[1:38:04] want to see a miracle, just look at
[1:38:05] Israel.
[1:38:07] How in the world could they survive with
[1:38:10] surrounded by the enemy on every side,
[1:38:13] millions upon billions of Muslims around
[1:38:15] them, everyone breathing down on their
[1:38:17] neck, wanting to destroy them, sending
[1:38:20] missiles, doing everything they can to
[1:38:22] wipe her off the face of the earth.
[1:38:27] Why does she exist? Because she is
[1:38:31] nourished by God.
[1:38:35] Because God had provided her a place. He
[1:38:38] look now he he brought her to her place.
[1:38:42] Now if God would take Israel to her
[1:38:46] place, don't he don't you know he's
[1:38:48] going to take you to your place?
[1:38:52] Amen.
[1:38:53] If this is what he does for the natural
[1:38:56] people, how much more will he do it for
[1:38:58] the spiritual people?
[1:39:00] So there is a place prepared for us.
[1:39:05] Amen. And the oh my there are homes.
[1:39:08] There are abodess. There are
[1:39:11] tabernacles. There are actually literal
[1:39:14] literal buildings and places. There are
[1:39:16] valleys. There are mountains. There are
[1:39:19] rivers. There are streams. There are
[1:39:21] cities. There are parks.
[1:39:23] I'm talking about your heaven.
[1:39:27] Amen. I'm talking about where we're
[1:39:29] going. And in there even more is going
[1:39:32] to even be better tabernacles which will
[1:39:34] be our theophony bodies
[1:39:37] which is better than anything that is
[1:39:39] gold and silver lined. Come on church.
[1:39:43] Amen. But new glorified bodies. He's
[1:39:46] prepared a place for you. He prepared a
[1:39:50] place for them in the wilderness. She
[1:39:53] fled to the wilderness because this is
[1:39:55] what the nation had become. a barren
[1:39:58] place for nearly 2,000 years. So she
[1:40:01] she's in this condition and and today
[1:40:05] modern Israel and the church both is
[1:40:09] under satanic attack to try to remove
[1:40:13] you or remove them from their place. So
[1:40:17] they're doing everything they can to
[1:40:19] destroy the nation of Israel. Get them
[1:40:21] out of their place. Don't let them
[1:40:22] possess their land.
[1:40:25] Right.
[1:40:26] Everybody run in from all these other
[1:40:28] nation, call yourself Palestinians and
[1:40:31] and camp out there to what? Keep Israel
[1:40:34] out of the promised land. And the devil
[1:40:37] would do the same thing to you. He'll
[1:40:39] camp right down on a divine promise, for
[1:40:42] your healing, for your miracle, for your
[1:40:45] salvation. He'll camp right down on it,
[1:40:47] and he'll do everything he can to keep
[1:40:49] you off of it. But church, don't do any
[1:40:53] deals with the devil.
[1:40:55] This is where Israel has always got in
[1:40:57] trouble is trying to appease the enemy.
[1:40:59] You don't appease your enemy. You
[1:41:02] destroy your enemy before he destroys
[1:41:04] you.
[1:41:09] So, Satan is there to hinder, to thwart
[1:41:12] the fulfillment of God's word by trying
[1:41:15] to force us out of our position. But the
[1:41:18] word of God is clear. It won't be us
[1:41:21] cast out and it won't be Israel cast
[1:41:22] out.
[1:41:24] But the prince of this world will be
[1:41:26] cast out.
[1:41:29] He will be first cast out of heaven,
[1:41:32] then his kingdom destroyed. Oh, think of
[1:41:34] that. Think about that. Think about what
[1:41:38] God did with the the nation of of Egypt.
[1:41:41] Remember, they dealt them a heavy hand.
[1:41:44] They brought them into slavery and
[1:41:46] bondage and did all kinds of horrible
[1:41:49] things to Israel. But God had a plan
[1:41:52] that after 400 years, he would bring
[1:41:54] them out with a mighty hand under a
[1:41:56] prophetic ministry in that Exodus.
[1:41:59] And so he when he leads them out, God
[1:42:02] brings them to a place where it looks
[1:42:05] like they are trapped.
[1:42:09] And there's no way out. I want you to
[1:42:12] understand the Bible said the end time
[1:42:14] will be a snare. It'll be a trap. Amen.
[1:42:19] Amen. But in there, God made a way
[1:42:22] through the Red Sea.
[1:42:24] And in doing so, he he coaxed all of
[1:42:28] Egypt's army right down into the Red Sea
[1:42:32] and destroyed them. Now, I want you to
[1:42:35] see what God's doing in this time. He'll
[1:42:37] make a way of escape of our bride, Jesus
[1:42:40] Christ. There will be a rapture of the
[1:42:43] church. Amen. And when it looks like she
[1:42:45] has no other place to go,
[1:42:48] when it looks like she's all surrounded
[1:42:51] and it ain't going to end well.
[1:42:54] Amen. Are you with me? That'll be when
[1:42:57] he'll come. And he'll make a way, amen,
[1:43:00] through the dimensions and take a bride
[1:43:03] out of here into glory in a rapture. And
[1:43:07] he'll come on and say, "Come on, Satan.
[1:43:09] Come on down. Come on down into this
[1:43:13] earth. Come on down here cuz I'm going
[1:43:17] to pour out my vials of judgment on your
[1:43:20] kingdom.
[1:43:25] And he'll do the act of avenger, the
[1:43:28] wrath of the
[1:43:30] lamb during the tribulation.
[1:43:33] So you see, he will be first cast out of
[1:43:37] heaven, then his kingdom will be
[1:43:40] destroyed. And what happened at Calvary
[1:43:43] was the start of it.
[1:43:46] The beginning of him being cast out
[1:43:48] until ultimately he will be bound for a
[1:43:52] thousand years. But first he would deal
[1:43:56] with the with the redemption of the soul
[1:43:59] because the casting out of Satan out of
[1:44:03] the soul of man where he does not
[1:44:05] belong. Now remember this has happened
[1:44:07] in all the way from Eden when when man
[1:44:10] sin Satan gained the throne of the soul.
[1:44:14] So the the gospel does what the Old
[1:44:18] Testament law could not do and that was
[1:44:21] to put the nature of God in the soul and
[1:44:25] put him on the throne of man.
[1:44:28] So you see here this is what he's doing.
[1:44:30] But notice as he talks about Calvary, he
[1:44:32] said,
[1:44:33] "Now, now begins the judgment of this
[1:44:38] world. And now shall the prince of this
[1:44:41] world being cast out." Where would it
[1:44:44] be? In the soul of man.
[1:44:47] So the casting out of Satan has already
[1:44:50] begun.
[1:44:52] I've experienced it. You've experienced
[1:44:54] it.
[1:44:56] And the church is commissioned to cast
[1:44:58] Satan out.
[1:45:01] Amen. To cast him out of souls, cast him
[1:45:03] out of bodies, cast him out of souls is
[1:45:06] salvation. It's to the dethroning of
[1:45:08] Satan and the throne where God becomes
[1:45:11] the king of your heart.
[1:45:13] So you see as he says
[1:45:16] in John 14:30, hereafter I'll not talk
[1:45:19] much with you, for the prince of this
[1:45:21] world cometh and he hath nothing in me.
[1:45:24] Now, this has to be the same thing the
[1:45:26] bride can say in this last day. The
[1:45:30] prince of this world is coming, but he
[1:45:33] have no part of me.
[1:45:35] I'm not of him. I'm not of his kingdom.
[1:45:39] And I'm not staying here in his kingdom.
[1:45:42] I'm not going to be taken and pulled
[1:45:43] back into it. I am going up, not down.
[1:45:48] I'm part of those ascending, not part of
[1:45:50] those that are falling.
[1:45:53] Amen. Yes, sir. Now, so the the prince
[1:45:58] of this world cometh and he hath nothing
[1:46:00] in me.
[1:46:03] Now, so here he
[1:46:05] says here we want to talk about the
[1:46:08] spirit of Judas now because I'm kept
[1:46:12] this place. Remember remember we have a
[1:46:15] position. Remember when the bride
[1:46:17] recognized her position, when she knows
[1:46:20] what it is, the rapture will come.
[1:46:22] Remember what he says? If the church
[1:46:24] would just know her position, wouldn't
[1:46:26] be any sick among us, be completely
[1:46:29] healed everywhere, right? It would take
[1:46:32] our position. So, Satan does everything
[1:46:35] he can to keep you from inheriting the
[1:46:39] divine promises, to keep you out of your
[1:46:42] promises. Are you with me now? So here
[1:46:47] right in the midst going along with it
[1:46:50] with them with the twel apostles is
[1:46:53] Judas.
[1:46:55] And I want you to notice he is he tries
[1:46:58] to take a position of a believer when he
[1:47:02] truly was a devil.
[1:47:06] The Bible calls
[1:47:07] him the it speaks of him as the man of
[1:47:12] sin. He he was Satan incarnate. Satan
[1:47:15] entered into him, right? Amen. So
[1:47:19] instead of receiving the Holy Ghost,
[1:47:22] he took another spirit, the spirit of
[1:47:25] Satan. Now, and of course then he
[1:47:28] betrayed the Lord. So the spirit of
[1:47:30] Judas will be here in this last day to
[1:47:34] try and and betray the truth.
[1:47:38] So you're going to look for it
[1:47:39] everywhere that you look. You're going
[1:47:40] to see the spirit of Judas at work.
[1:47:43] That's right. Amen. And and he's a
[1:47:46] symbol of Satan working in false
[1:47:48] believers among the true occupying
[1:47:52] places that do not belong to them. So
[1:47:56] Judas was bound and he was never crossed
[1:47:58] over into the fullness of of the spirit
[1:48:02] that and because that spirit will only
[1:48:04] go so far. Look look what brother
[1:48:06] Brandham said in three kinds of
[1:48:07] believers. He said, "Jesus, we find out,
[1:48:09] has warned us against these last days
[1:48:12] and these kind of people. It' be so much
[1:48:14] like the real thing. They would
[1:48:16] absolutely deceive the very elected
[1:48:18] ones." What is that? That's the Judases.
[1:48:21] The people that goes up so far, look
[1:48:24] like they can cry, shout, claim to cast
[1:48:26] out devils, everything, and turn back
[1:48:29] and deny around and deny the word.
[1:48:31] Exactly. They have a form of godliness.
[1:48:34] Look where Judas came. The Judas spirit
[1:48:36] climbed up in the gospel to the place of
[1:48:39] Pentecost. But when it comes time for
[1:48:42] his baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:48:45] and these other things that goes with
[1:48:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, he walked
[1:48:49] out. He showed his colors and that
[1:48:51] spirit can live in those denominations
[1:48:53] until he gets right to that truth. And
[1:48:56] then she drops back like the spirit that
[1:48:58] was on them that forerrun their coming
[1:49:00] just as John forun Jesus coming. So we
[1:49:03] also have the spirit of Judas
[1:49:05] forerunning the antichrist.
[1:49:08] And look where it can come. He'll get
[1:49:11] all the way but he'll deny Pentecost.
[1:49:14] He'll never go up to the upper room.
[1:49:18] This is why you know preaching on the
[1:49:21] new birth, preaching on the baptism of
[1:49:23] the Holy Ghost is so important because
[1:49:26] why? The spirit of Judas can go that far
[1:49:29] but he won't go all the way to the full
[1:49:31] birth. Right. Now, that's the problem.
[1:49:35] These spirits can live right in message
[1:49:38] churches and accept the doctrines, but
[1:49:41] when it really comes to dealing with
[1:49:43] issues and dying out to self and
[1:49:46] receiving the true baptism of the Holy
[1:49:48] Ghost, they show their colors.
[1:49:52] Now, I want to get this clear. Judas
[1:49:55] never did belong in a position as an
[1:49:59] apostle of our Lord. That's right.
[1:50:03] Judas occupied a position that was not
[1:50:07] ready to be filled.
[1:50:13] Now, whose position was that? The
[1:50:14] Apostle Paul. And Paul would be one born
[1:50:17] out of due season.
[1:50:20] So, here he he is numbered among the
[1:50:24] 12, but he there's a purpose in mind
[1:50:28] because there has to be a betrayer.
[1:50:32] And and I want you to see a lot of times
[1:50:35] we look for persecution and things to
[1:50:37] come from far out there. But if you
[1:50:41] notice how that it moves right in the
[1:50:43] message ranks
[1:50:47] and opposition against the truth. Do you
[1:50:50] realize even the crucifixion of brother
[1:50:52] Brandham and and the horrible things
[1:50:55] have come from those who say they
[1:50:57] believe the sign.
[1:51:03] Are you with me? The spirit of Judas
[1:51:05] living right there so close but never
[1:51:09] going on to real new birth
[1:51:12] and they fall off
[1:51:15] and as they fall off they betray the
[1:51:18] Lord. Now we're in a time where this
[1:51:21] betrayal is going on. Now I want you to
[1:51:23] see this of the spirit of Judas. And
[1:51:26] because again we're talking about
[1:51:28] placing now. Watch this. You have a
[1:51:31] place. Israel is being taken to her
[1:51:34] place. Her position. You are being
[1:51:37] positioned. Watch now. Look at this.
[1:51:39] Here's one that is occupying a place
[1:51:42] that doesn't belong to him. Acts 1:16.
[1:51:46] Men and brethren, the scripture must
[1:51:47] needs to have been fulfilled which the
[1:51:49] Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake
[1:51:51] concerning Judas, which is a guide to
[1:51:53] them that took Jesus. for he was
[1:51:55] numbered with us and hath obtained part
[1:51:59] of this ministry. Now I want you to see
[1:52:01] how the thoughts can come in right up so
[1:52:05] close
[1:52:08] so close to the truth to the right in
[1:52:11] the inner circle.
[1:52:14] You have the outer circle
[1:52:17] scribes and Pharisees. You think that
[1:52:19] that's where the deception's coming. No,
[1:52:21] it's coming from closer. Here comes the
[1:52:23] 70.
[1:52:25] Now you have another group and they walk
[1:52:27] with him no more. Then you come a little
[1:52:30] closer right into the and it just moves
[1:52:33] on right on in into the 12. And one of
[1:52:35] them's a devil.
[1:52:37] I've chosen 12 of you and one of you is
[1:52:39] a devil. One of you will betray me.
[1:52:43] It moves right in. So he says he was
[1:52:47] numbered with us and had obtained part
[1:52:50] of this ministry. Oh yeah. He laid hands
[1:52:52] on the sick. He used the name of Jesus.
[1:52:55] He prayed prayers of faith. I'm I'm
[1:52:58] talking about Judas.
[1:53:00] And the Bible said that many would come
[1:53:02] to me in that day saying, "Lord, Lord,
[1:53:04] have I not cast out devils in your
[1:53:05] name?" Didn't we speak with new tongues?
[1:53:08] And he said, "Depart from me, you
[1:53:09] workers of iniquity. I never knew you."
[1:53:12] That's right.
[1:53:14] So again, this man purchased with a a
[1:53:18] field with the reward of iniquity,
[1:53:21] fallen headlong, he burst a sunder in
[1:53:24] the midst, and all his bowels gushed
[1:53:26] out. And it was known unto all the
[1:53:29] dwellers at Jerusalem in so much that
[1:53:32] this field is called in their proper
[1:53:34] tongue Alcadelma, which is that is to
[1:53:37] say, the field of blood. For it is
[1:53:39] written in the Psalms, "Let his
[1:53:43] habitation be desolate, and let no man
[1:53:47] dwell in him, and his bishop let another
[1:53:50] take." So again, it's prophesied in
[1:53:53] there that that his habitation would
[1:53:56] come become desolate, and his bishop
[1:54:00] could that another person would take.
[1:54:03] And then we see them that they prayed
[1:54:06] and said, "Lord, thou knowest the heart
[1:54:08] of all men. Show us which of these two
[1:54:11] they chosen that he may take part of
[1:54:13] this ministry and apostilhip from which
[1:54:16] Judas by transgression fell." Watch now.
[1:54:21] That he might go on to his what?
[1:54:24] Own place.
[1:54:27] Because this was never his place. He was
[1:54:30] occupying a place that was never his.
[1:54:39] But now he goes to his own place.
[1:54:43] Now, Brother Brandham talks about
[1:54:45] Calvary and he said, you know, you look
[1:54:46] and you see three crosses. He said, I
[1:54:48] see
[1:54:50] four. And he says there was Jesus
[1:54:54] hanging between two thieves. One, he was
[1:54:58] there. You know, one went with him to
[1:55:00] paradise. So, he took one with him to
[1:55:02] heaven
[1:55:04] and the other thief is hanging on the
[1:55:07] cross. Guess what? Look down the hill
[1:55:10] there. There's another hanging from a
[1:55:12] tree cuz the Bible said he went out and
[1:55:15] hung himself.
[1:55:17] So, he's also hanging from a tree. And
[1:55:20] cursed is he that hangs from a tree. So,
[1:55:23] here he comes and Judas now hangs
[1:55:26] himself. Here's your fourth cross. and
[1:55:28] he takes the unrepentant sinner with him
[1:55:32] to hell.
[1:55:35] So you see the dividing line that will
[1:55:38] happen in the last day. One will go to
[1:55:41] heaven with Christ. The other will be
[1:55:43] swept away by the antichrist.
[1:55:46] And the Bible tells about these angels
[1:55:48] which kept not their first estate but
[1:55:50] left their own habitation. and he
[1:55:53] reserved in everlasting chains to unto
[1:55:56] darkness and to the day of judgment. So
[1:55:58] they left, they kept not their first
[1:56:01] estate. So they fell. So let's look here
[1:56:04] according to the book of Revelation.
[1:56:07] This will happen to Satan. And there was
[1:56:10] war in heaven. Michael and his angels
[1:56:12] fought against the dragon. The dragon
[1:56:14] fought and his angels and prevailed not.
[1:56:18] I love that. Don't you love it? Amen.
[1:56:22] just to see the enemy is not going to
[1:56:24] win.
[1:56:26] If you could only get a view of that
[1:56:28] about your sickness, about your
[1:56:31] situation,
[1:56:32] no matter how sore the battle is against
[1:56:34] you, the devil's not going to win. It's
[1:56:37] prophesied in the scripture. He
[1:56:40] prevailed not. Watch now. Neither was
[1:56:44] their place found anymore in heaven.
[1:56:49] So now they have also been occupying a
[1:56:52] place that did not belong to them. It
[1:56:55] belonged to you, the sons and daughters
[1:56:57] of God. But guess what? Amen. Instead of
[1:57:01] him forcing us out of our place, we are
[1:57:03] forcing him out of our place. And we are
[1:57:07] ascending into the heavenly realms.
[1:57:10] Amen. And the devil, the great dragon
[1:57:13] was cast out. That old serpent called
[1:57:15] the devil and Satan which deceiveth the
[1:57:17] whole world. He was cast out in the
[1:57:18] earth. His angels were cast out with
[1:57:20] him. And I heard a loud voice saying in
[1:57:22] heaven, "Now is come
[1:57:26] salvation." Hallelujah.
[1:57:29] And strengthen the kingdom of our God
[1:57:32] and the power of his Christ. For the
[1:57:34] accuser of our brethren is cast down,
[1:57:39] which accuse him before our God day and
[1:57:41] night.
[1:57:43] Hallelujah. Do you realize we're in the
[1:57:46] time where the
[1:57:47] accusation is no longer being received?
[1:57:52] When you look at the family of God that
[1:57:54] is assembled in Revelation
[1:57:57] five and all the family is there, how
[1:58:01] different that is from when Job and the
[1:58:04] family of God assembled because Satan
[1:58:07] was right there to accuse. Amen. How
[1:58:09] different it was with Joshua the high
[1:58:11] priest in Zachchariah's prophecy when he
[1:58:14] was right there and Satan was right
[1:58:15] there at his right hand to oppose him.
[1:58:18] But when you look at Revelation 5, when
[1:58:21] the lamb takes the book,
[1:58:24] hallelujah, when he calls for his
[1:58:26] redeemed,
[1:58:28] there is no mention of that old serpent
[1:58:31] called the devil being there. He is not
[1:58:34] gathered at the family gathering
[1:58:36] anymore. No longer can he accuse because
[1:58:40] the lamb has paid the debt completely
[1:58:44] taken the book and loosed the seals.
[1:58:48] Hallelujah. No wonder you are
[1:58:51] justified before his presence. You never
[1:58:54] did it in the first place.
[1:58:59] And so therefore, heaven is celebrating.
[1:59:02] Now has come salvation and strength in
[1:59:05] the kingdom of our of our God.
[1:59:07] You see, this this points to the
[1:59:10] unfolding of God's final victory over
[1:59:13] Satan's work. For we will be changed in
[1:59:16] a moment, in a twinkling of an eye.
[1:59:18] There there won't even be any sin stains
[1:59:20] in our garments. Oh, it's so important
[1:59:23] that you change clothes. You don't want
[1:59:26] to meet him in a in a in this old robe
[1:59:29] that you smoked in and stained with
[1:59:31] alcohol and sex sins and drugs and all
[1:59:34] kinds of violence. Come on. These old
[1:59:37] garments have been stained, but oh,
[1:59:39] they're going to be changed. We're going
[1:59:41] to get new garments, and we'll stand
[1:59:43] before him in a glorified condition, in
[1:59:46] a in a body that never smoked, never
[1:59:48] drank, never lied, never had evil
[1:59:50] thought.
[1:59:52] Hallelujah. Justified in his presence.
[1:59:56] What a glorious day that's going to be.
[1:59:59] Amen. So salvation, full deliverance,
[2:00:03] full redemption, full vindication. I
[2:00:06] want you to remember, we're in the days
[2:00:08] of full redemption. That's what seven
[2:00:10] angels in the cloud represented was full
[2:00:13] redemption. Amen. The seven ang angels
[2:00:16] represented the seven church ages.
[2:00:19] Again, you see the kingdom of our God is
[2:00:23] a rulership
[2:00:25] uh of now of God is fully enforced
[2:00:28] unchallenged by the devil because the
[2:00:31] accuser of the brethren is cast down.
[2:00:33] And notice, and they overcame him by the
[2:00:37] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[2:00:39] their testimony, and they love not their
[2:00:42] lives unto their death. So they overcame
[2:00:46] him. That old serpent we're talking
[2:00:48] about, the one that begaliled Eve, the
[2:00:51] one that begaliled Israel
[2:00:53] and deceived her. Come on. The one who
[2:00:56] begiled the early church. But guess
[2:00:59] what? You have a different destiny.
[2:01:02] You see, they were made where they could
[2:01:04] fall. But when you are born again, you
[2:01:07] are sealed by the Holy Ghost. And you
[2:01:10] are now made where you can't fall.
[2:01:14] You are sealed to the day of redemption.
[2:01:16] So you have a different destiny. You
[2:01:18] have been predestinated not to fall.
[2:01:22] That's right. Hallelujah.
[2:01:25] So we turned down his lies. You know
[2:01:28] that's why brother Brandham talked about
[2:01:29] that and he said they said we were once
[2:01:33] those angels who those spirits that
[2:01:37] rotated off of God who did not believe
[2:01:40] the devil's
[2:01:43] lie. Oh, you mean we existed
[2:01:46] pre-existed? No, we didn't pre-existed,
[2:01:49] but in God's thoughts.
[2:01:51] But in God's thoughts, he saw us in
[2:01:54] time.
[2:01:56] Just like he did Christ, he in God's
[2:01:58] thinking, he saw him as a lamb slain
[2:02:01] from the foundation of the world. So for
[2:02:03] the world began, he saw him in his mind
[2:02:06] as a lamb slain. So he also saw you
[2:02:09] overcoming the devil's lie. Amen. He saw
[2:02:13] you right here in this evil age,
[2:02:15] standing for righteousness and for truth
[2:02:18] and overcoming in this generation.
[2:02:21] What am I trying to tell you? You've
[2:02:22] already been seen in victory.
[2:02:28] Already been seen
[2:02:29] there. You remember Bill Dao, brother
[2:02:33] Brandham rushed to his side, 90s
[2:02:35] something years old, shows you God don't
[2:02:38] care how old you are, he'll heal you.
[2:02:43] I'm passing my three scoring 10. Well,
[2:02:44] he'll still heal.
[2:02:47] You know, Bill Dow's past 90 and he's
[2:02:49] dying, gasping for breath under an
[2:02:51] oxygen tent. Brother Brandon said, "I
[2:02:53] wore the old tires off my car getting to
[2:02:55] him. He had a blowout along the way."
[2:02:57] And he finally got there and he stood by
[2:02:59] the side of Bill Dao and he's gasping
[2:03:02] for breath and brother brother Brandham
[2:03:05] looked at him and as he and a vision
[2:03:08] broke and he says Bill you'll not die
[2:03:12] for I see you in front of the blue boore
[2:03:15] restaurant shaking my hand. Oh yes.
[2:03:21] Amen. He had been seen in the vision.
[2:03:27] And it didn't matter how many more gasp
[2:03:29] he had, how many more days he stayed in
[2:03:33] the oxygen tent, how many hours of
[2:03:36] recovery and days of rehabilitation. He
[2:03:40] just kept walking until one day he
[2:03:43] walked and he's there. And brother
[2:03:46] Brandham sticks out his hand and says,
[2:03:47] "Bill, here's the vision.
[2:03:52] He walked right into the vision. Now,
[2:03:54] you've already seen been seen in the
[2:03:56] vision. You have been seen as one who
[2:04:00] will turn down the devil's lie. Who will
[2:04:02] overcome in this age? What are you going
[2:04:05] to do? You're going to take one step at
[2:04:07] a time until you match the vision.
[2:04:13] So, they turned him down, but turned
[2:04:15] down his lies and and overcame his
[2:04:18] deception. and they they were filled
[2:04:20] with the spirit and washed in the blood
[2:04:22] and and this is the foundation of our
[2:04:26] victory. For our victory is not what we
[2:04:29] done but what he did.
[2:04:33] So the blood of Jesus defeats Satan's
[2:04:35] power. It cleanses sins. It cancels the
[2:04:38] his legal accusation. It justifies and
[2:04:41] protects the believers. We're under the
[2:04:43] protection of the blood. The blood's our
[2:04:45] covenant. It's our righteousness. is our
[2:04:47] defense against every accusation of the
[2:04:50] devil. Aren't you glad for that? Yes,
[2:04:53] sir. And we also overcome by the word of
[2:04:57] our testimony.
[2:04:59] Our testimony is the personal spoken
[2:05:02] witness of what Jesus has done in our
[2:05:04] lives.
[2:05:06] Every believer has a testimony.
[2:05:12] Mike Smith Wigglesworth said, "He that
[2:05:14] hath an experience is not merely, you
[2:05:17] know, is is not at the mercy of him that
[2:05:20] merely hath an argument."
[2:05:23] Amen. My testimony, the word of their
[2:05:26] testimony, my testimony, not mothers,
[2:05:29] not daddies, but my testimony, a
[2:05:31] personal revelation. He did this for me.
[2:05:34] It's a confession of faith. And it's not
[2:05:36] just words, but it's a life that is
[2:05:38] lived in alignment with the truth. Amen.
[2:05:41] And in the face of threats and trials
[2:05:44] and persecution, their testimony
[2:05:47] remained faithful. They love not their
[2:05:50] lives unto the death. They believed him
[2:05:53] so much, devoted so much to him that
[2:05:55] they were willing to die rather than to
[2:05:58] deny him.
[2:06:01] Amen. They Let me tell you, that's not
[2:06:03] just the attitude of the martyrs. That's
[2:06:06] the attitude of every Christian. They
[2:06:08] deny self to follow Jesus.
[2:06:12] And this is, like I said, not just about
[2:06:14] martyrdom. It's about living every day
[2:06:16] with a soldout faith that refuses to be
[2:06:20] silenced by fear, unbelief, or
[2:06:23] compromise or by the devil. I will not
[2:06:26] be silenced. I have a testimony.
[2:06:29] Amen. Jesus saved me. Jesus delivered
[2:06:32] me.
[2:06:34] You see, victory comes when when the
[2:06:36] fear of death no longer controls us
[2:06:39] because we trust the one who conquered
[2:06:41] death, hell, and the grave.
[2:06:44] So it said, "Therefore, rejoice ye
[2:06:46] heavens and ye that dwell in them." So
[2:06:49] it turns now the view to the raptured
[2:06:52] saints in glory and says, "Rejoice ye
[2:06:54] heavens, ye that dwell in them. But
[2:06:57] looking back to the earth now, woe to
[2:06:58] the inhabitants of the earth and the
[2:07:00] sea. For the devil is come down to you
[2:07:03] having great wrath because he know he
[2:07:05] hath but a short time. Notice
[2:07:09] here has but a short
[2:07:12] time. Three and a half years. That's all
[2:07:16] he has.
[2:07:18] And he'll set up his kingdom on the
[2:07:20] earth. But he's not going to enjoy it
[2:07:23] because we're going to watch it watch it
[2:07:25] plagued.
[2:07:27] She is going to be paid back for all of
[2:07:30] the murder she's done to the ages.
[2:07:36] Verse 13. And when the devil saw he was
[2:07:39] cast to the earth, he persecuted the
[2:07:41] woman that brought forth a mind child.
[2:07:43] So Israel is going to be a persecuted
[2:07:46] people.
[2:07:50] Amen. And so you can you can expect this
[2:07:52] time on time again that where she will
[2:07:55] be persecuted. Watch now. And when the
[2:07:58] dragon he he persecuted the woman that
[2:08:00] brought forth the manchild. Verse 14.
[2:08:03] And and to the woman were given two
[2:08:06] wings of a great eagle. Watch. That she
[2:08:10] might fly into the wilderness where?
[2:08:13] Into her place.
[2:08:18] So it's important that Israel gets in
[2:08:21] her place.
[2:08:23] But how does she get in her
[2:08:25] position? By giving the wings of a great
[2:08:29] eagle,
[2:08:32] right?
[2:08:34] Amen. You see, it'll be those two
[2:08:36] witnesses,
[2:08:38] which will be Moses and Elijah
[2:08:41] representing law and prophet, the
[2:08:43] complete Old Testament. Amen. That will
[2:08:46] give her wings to go right into her
[2:08:50] position and recognize her Messiah.
[2:08:56] Now, what's the parallel, church?
[2:08:58] Because how do we get in our place? How
[2:09:01] does the bride get in a position? By the
[2:09:04] wings of a great eagle,
[2:09:07] right? by a Malachi 4 prophet who brings
[2:09:12] a message of
[2:09:13] restoration that gives us the wings to
[2:09:17] fly in the promise of God where we can
[2:09:20] get in our position
[2:09:23] our place
[2:09:26] so we come under the eagle anointing in
[2:09:28] this day because that's our calling
[2:09:33] how many believes that
[2:09:35] so you see we are we are there. Watch
[2:09:38] now. And she is nourished for a time
[2:09:42] that's one year times two years and a
[2:09:46] half time that's three and a half years
[2:09:48] now from the face of the
[2:09:51] serpent. So this is how she gets into
[2:09:53] her place. And the serpent cast out of
[2:09:57] his mouth water as a flood after the
[2:10:01] woman that she might be caused to be
[2:10:04] carried away of the flood. So now here
[2:10:07] watch now what happens the flood is
[2:10:09] armies.
[2:10:11] If you remember in the Bible waters is
[2:10:13] multitudes nation kindred people all
[2:10:16] nations will be against Jerusalem.
[2:10:19] So you can expect all the way to the end
[2:10:22] for Israel to be in turmoil.
[2:10:25] She will be persecuted by the serpent.
[2:10:28] He will cast out of his mouth water and
[2:10:32] like a flood and try to overcome her, to
[2:10:35] carry her away or the flood. To carry
[2:10:37] her away means to remove her from her
[2:10:39] position, to take her out of her land.
[2:10:42] But I want to remind the devil, God
[2:10:44] placed her there, not you. And when God
[2:10:47] places you on that, Amen. There ain't no
[2:10:50] the gates of hell will not prevail. Come
[2:10:52] on, church. When God puts you in
[2:10:55] position
[2:10:57] and he places you as a son, there ain't
[2:10:59] enough devils in hell can ever remove
[2:11:01] you from that place.
[2:11:06] No matter what armies he has, the floods
[2:11:08] that he brings that he cast out of his
[2:11:11] mouth, look where they're coming from.
[2:11:14] Listen, these are
[2:11:17] satanic armies. That's right.
[2:11:19] Satan stirring up over and over. You
[2:11:23] know, stop for a minute. Who is it? Who
[2:11:26] is it that are that is
[2:11:28] contesting contesting with Israel about
[2:11:31] the land of promise? Who is it? It is
[2:11:35] the Ishraelites.
[2:11:41] The child of the bond woman. And she is
[2:11:45] trying to do what?
[2:11:49] force her out of her inheritance,
[2:11:52] denying that Isaac is the true one
[2:11:56] because he's the one of the promise.
[2:11:58] Amen. Right. Amen. This other was a was
[2:12:02] one because of Sarah's false doctrine
[2:12:04] because of false doctrine to to ma
[2:12:06] Muhammad to hear here you got the whole
[2:12:08] Muslim race and the whole Muslim kingdom
[2:12:12] and there the whole thing. Look now they
[2:12:14] they got a counterpart. I want you to
[2:12:17] get it because it's just not this the
[2:12:19] seed of the woman Hagar there as as
[2:12:22] Muhammadans but you got right over here
[2:12:24] you got to look from there and you see
[2:12:26] the seed of the woman
[2:12:29] which is again Hagar which is the church
[2:12:34] and here she is down on your promise
[2:12:38] we're going the ones going in the
[2:12:39] rapture we're the ones going to receive
[2:12:42] the kingdom we're the ones that that has
[2:12:45] all the blessings And they're camping
[2:12:46] right down on your scriptures, making
[2:12:49] their denominations on it.
[2:12:51] Are you with me? Saying, "This is ours
[2:12:54] and this is our portion that doesn't
[2:12:55] belong to you, but God placed you,
[2:13:00] open up the seals, and supernaturally
[2:13:03] has placed you in the land."
[2:13:06] And the the children of Hagar are doing
[2:13:09] everything. But I want you to understand
[2:13:10] the prophecy cast out the bondswoman and
[2:13:14] her child. That's right. Because they
[2:13:17] will not be heir. That's why brother
[2:13:19] Brandon preaches seed not heir with the
[2:13:20] child. He said the child of the bond
[2:13:22] woman will not be heir with the children
[2:13:24] of the free. Amen. The denomination will
[2:13:27] not go into rapture. Only the bride.
[2:13:31] I'm telling you church, the the rapture
[2:13:33] is for you. That's right. And the rest
[2:13:35] of them can claim it, but it's for you.
[2:13:38] This is why God sent a message in this
[2:13:40] day to turn your heart to put you into
[2:13:43] place and it happens supernaturally.
[2:13:49] So
[2:13:51] now so again I want you to
[2:13:54] see here the earth helped the woman and
[2:13:59] the earth opened up her mouth and
[2:14:02] swallowed up the flood which the dragon
[2:14:04] cast out of his mouth. Now, this speaks
[2:14:07] of a prophecy in the last
[2:14:11] days. In the last days, it is promised
[2:14:14] that Jesus will truly come back to the
[2:14:18] earth. Now, I want you to get this. He
[2:14:22] will not come to the earth for the
[2:14:24] rapture. We meet him in the air. Amen.
[2:14:30] So he will come to the earth and his
[2:14:33] feet will stand in that day upon the
[2:14:37] mount of olives.
[2:14:39] I said it said the mount of olives is
[2:14:41] where he left from. But nevertheless his
[2:14:44] feet will stand in that day upon the
[2:14:46] mount of olives. And the mount of olives
[2:14:48] shall cleave in the midst and ye shall
[2:14:51] flee to the valley. And the Lord my God
[2:14:54] shall come and all the saints with thee.
[2:14:57] Where is this? This is Revelation 19
[2:15:00] where here he comes there for the battle
[2:15:02] of Armageddon, the Lord of Lord, King of
[2:15:05] Kings and all of the saints of heaven
[2:15:08] with him.
[2:15:10] This is the time when we will return
[2:15:13] back to the earth with him.
[2:15:16] So the Lord will come and he will fight
[2:15:18] for him in the for them in the day of
[2:15:20] battle. And so this is where the Lord
[2:15:22] physically returns to earth. He meets us
[2:15:25] in the air, but when he comes at the end
[2:15:28] of the tribulation period, he physically
[2:15:31] returns to the earth, placing his feet
[2:15:35] on the Mount of Olives. Until then,
[2:15:37] Brother Brandham tells us over and
[2:15:39] again, his blessed feet will never touch
[2:15:41] the earth until he returns there to the
[2:15:45] Jews at on the Mount of Olives. So as we
[2:15:49] look at this, there will be in that day
[2:15:52] a massive earthquake that is triggered
[2:15:56] by the coming of the Lord where that the
[2:15:58] mountain literally splits in two.
[2:16:01] And as it splits, it creates a valley, a
[2:16:05] way of escape for his people during that
[2:16:08] great battle of Armageddon.
[2:16:10] So look what God does. He provides a way
[2:16:13] of escape by his coming.
[2:16:17] Doesn't he do that for you?
[2:16:19] He provides a way of escape by his
[2:16:23] coming and we meet him in the air and
[2:16:26] for Israel he fin provides a way of
[2:16:29] escape by his coming and there's a great
[2:16:33] earthquake
[2:16:34] at
[2:16:36] Armageddon. And during this great battle
[2:16:38] the mountain literally splits and it
[2:16:41] creates a way of escape for his people.
[2:16:44] So let me let me just show you in
[2:16:46] Revelation 19 where this comes. And I
[2:16:49] saw heaven open and behold a white horse
[2:16:52] and he that sat on him was called
[2:16:54] faithful and true and in righteous. He
[2:16:56] does righteousness he doth judge and
[2:16:58] make war. And his eyes were as a flame
[2:17:01] of fire and on his head were many
[2:17:02] crowns. Stop for a minute. Why does he
[2:17:05] have many
[2:17:07] crowns? Because the saints will crown
[2:17:10] him king.
[2:17:13] So the very crowns that we are given
[2:17:18] we will place upon him.
[2:17:21] Because really our victory was really
[2:17:24] his victory.
[2:17:26] Hallelujah. I I overcame Lord. But I did
[2:17:30] it. I received this crown. But it was
[2:17:32] your victory in my life. And so
[2:17:34] therefore I place my crown up on you.
[2:17:37] You're Lord of Lord and King of Kings.
[2:17:40] Amen. Amen. Oh my. So look what he
[2:17:45] says. In his head was many crown. It had
[2:17:48] a name written that no man knew but he
[2:17:51] himself. And he was clothed with a
[2:17:54] vesture dipped in blood. Now notice he's
[2:17:57] also clothed with a vesture dipped in
[2:18:02] blood. And his name is called the word
[2:18:06] of God. Amen. Amen. And the armies which
[2:18:10] are in heaven followed him upon white
[2:18:13] horses clothed in fine linen clean light
[2:18:16] and clean. We already know what that is.
[2:18:18] And on his m out of his mouth goeth a
[2:18:20] sharp sword that he would smite the
[2:18:23] nations. Watch now. This man child would
[2:18:25] rule with a rod of iron. And he shall
[2:18:28] rule them with a rod of iron. He'll
[2:18:30] bring on the millennium for and he
[2:18:33] treadth the wine press and the
[2:18:34] fierceness of the wrath of God. So he'll
[2:18:37] absolutely crush his enemies.
[2:18:41] Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[2:18:43] Now church, many around the message want
[2:18:46] to say, "Oh, that's happening now. All
[2:18:48] of this is happening now." No, this is
[2:18:50] not happening now.
[2:18:53] We We are not in the scripture yet. This
[2:18:55] is fulfilled after the rapture
[2:18:58] and the saints will come with him.
[2:19:03] Now, so as we look here in in the
[2:19:07] scripture,
[2:19:09] um out of we we when we see here that he
[2:19:13] hath on his vesture and on his thigh a
[2:19:16] name written, King of Kings and Lord of
[2:19:18] Lords. And I saw an angel standing in
[2:19:21] the sun, and he cried with a loud voice,
[2:19:24] saying to all the fowls that fly in the
[2:19:27] midst of the heaven, "Come and gather
[2:19:29] yourselves together into the supper of
[2:19:31] the great God, that you may eat the
[2:19:33] flesh of kings and flesh of captains,
[2:19:35] the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh
[2:19:37] of the horses, and of them that sit on
[2:19:39] them, and the flesh of men, both free
[2:19:42] and bond, both small and great.
[2:19:47] And I saw the beast and the kings of the
[2:19:50] earth and their armies and gathered
[2:19:52] together to make war against him that
[2:19:54] sat on the horse and against his army.
[2:19:57] And the beast was taken and with him the
[2:19:59] false prophet that wrought miracles
[2:20:01] before them and with which he deceived
[2:20:03] them that received the mark of the beast
[2:20:05] and them that worshiped his image. These
[2:20:08] both were cast alive into the lake of
[2:20:11] fire burning with brimstone. and the
[2:20:13] remnant were slain with the sword of him
[2:20:16] that sat upon the horse, which sword
[2:20:19] proceedth out of his mouth, and all of
[2:20:22] the fowls were filled with their
[2:20:25] flesh. So, you see, this is where it
[2:20:28] comes.
[2:20:29] Now, looking at
[2:20:31] this, we want to look back for a moment
[2:20:35] at the beast of Revelation, chapter
[2:20:39] 13. Because I want you to see end time
[2:20:42] prophecy.
[2:20:44] Remember, in the days of Noah, God
[2:20:47] baptized the earth with water. In the
[2:20:51] days of Jesus, he shed his blood upon
[2:20:53] it. So, that's water blood. Then, in the
[2:20:56] last days, what will he do? He'll
[2:20:57] cleanse the earth with fire, which is a
[2:20:59] symbolic of the spirit. So just the same
[2:21:02] as he he redeems the earth, he redeems
[2:21:05] you. Water, blood, spirit. Now notice
[2:21:08] this as as we as we see this, we know
[2:21:12] then the end
[2:21:14] time judgment will be the earth burning
[2:21:18] with fire.
[2:21:20] And this is what the Bible prophesies.
[2:21:22] He will not baptize the earth with water
[2:21:25] again. He put a rainbow in the cloud.
[2:21:26] Said I'll not do it again. All right.
[2:21:29] Here's my covenant sign. I'll not I'll
[2:21:31] not flood the earth again and like I did
[2:21:34] here. I I baptized it with water once.
[2:21:38] So then again, he said, "Now I shed my
[2:21:41] blood of it in in the days of Jesus, but
[2:21:43] now he will burn it with fire." But I
[2:21:45] want you to watch now because the earth
[2:21:48] will have a
[2:21:50] burning which the prophet Malachi picks
[2:21:53] up in revel Malachi chapter 4 which he
[2:21:56] says the earth will burn as an oven and
[2:22:01] it'll all be as stubble and we'll walk
[2:22:03] out on the ashes of the wicked.
[2:22:06] And so we know we are in an age where
[2:22:10] it's the first age of time where there
[2:22:14] are wonders coming from heaven
[2:22:17] where the fires are coming out of heaven
[2:22:20] that are able to destroy the earth many
[2:22:23] times. And I want you to see the power
[2:22:26] of the beast that comes out of the earth
[2:22:29] that he had two horns like a lamb and he
[2:22:32] spoke as a dragon. Now, this rose up out
[2:22:34] of the land, which was a a place that
[2:22:38] was formerly basically
[2:22:41] uninhabited because the other beasts
[2:22:43] rose up out of the sea, which was
[2:22:44] multitudes, nation, tongues, and people.
[2:22:47] So, it rose up out of Europe. This one
[2:22:49] rises out of the land of America. It has
[2:22:52] the two horns that brother Brandham also
[2:22:54] always said, you know, was civil and
[2:22:56] ecclesiastical powers. And he says it
[2:22:59] had horns like a lamb. So it begins out
[2:23:02] like a lamb
[2:23:05] but it ends speaking like a dragon.
[2:23:09] So it starts out with freedom of
[2:23:11] religion.
[2:23:13] But then becomes very debolic in his
[2:23:16] nature.
[2:23:18] So you I I don't know what you're
[2:23:20] thinking about your politics. It's only
[2:23:22] going to get worse. That's right. and
[2:23:25] things are going on right now that are
[2:23:26] setting the stage for the end time
[2:23:29] process.
[2:23:32] And so again, he will exercise all the
[2:23:35] authority of the first beast, which was
[2:23:37] Rome, in his
[2:23:39] presence and cause all the the earth and
[2:23:43] those who dwell with it to worship the
[2:23:44] first beast, Rome, the Catholic Church,
[2:23:48] whose deadly wound was healed. We know
[2:23:50] how that was healed, right? because it
[2:23:53] was first pagan Rome. That's what it was
[2:23:55] in the days of Christ. But it it one of
[2:23:58] its heads get wounded and it gets gets
[2:24:00] healed and that's when it changed under
[2:24:03] Constantine from from pagan Rome to
[2:24:06] papal Rome and now she comes with her
[2:24:10] and he performs great signs so that he
[2:24:13] makes fire come down from heaven on the
[2:24:16] earth in the sight of men. And who got
[2:24:18] the atomic bomb? America.
[2:24:24] And of course you know the whole world
[2:24:26] is reigned into control with the power
[2:24:30] of the atomic weapons.
[2:24:33] You know here you got two nations today
[2:24:35] India and Pakistan Pakistan you know
[2:24:38] rising up against both of them have
[2:24:40] nuclear powers.
[2:24:43] But you see what holds them back is
[2:24:45] knowing if we unleash
[2:24:47] it. Nothing, you know, it ain't nothing
[2:24:50] going to stop.
[2:24:53] And you got Russia over here and they've
[2:24:55] got it now stole the secrets from
[2:24:58] America and and everything else and
[2:25:00] whatever. And now it's China's got it
[2:25:02] and all of these other, you know, we
[2:25:04] have all of these having, you know,
[2:25:06] ready to destroy the world.
[2:25:10] And let me just tell you, the Bible says
[2:25:13] it will burn like an oven.
[2:25:16] The Bible said the elements will melt
[2:25:19] with a fervent heat.
[2:25:21] The Bible prophesies we are going to be
[2:25:25] destroyed as a world, not just America.
[2:25:28] The world will burn off for the
[2:25:30] millennium.
[2:25:34] So we're here. We're at the end time. He
[2:25:36] performs great signs. So he maketh fire
[2:25:38] come down from heaven in the sight of
[2:25:40] men. Let's just go to
[2:25:42] another. And this shall be the plague
[2:25:45] wherewith he the Lord will s smite all
[2:25:48] the people that have fought against
[2:25:50] Jerusalem. Their flesh shall consume
[2:25:53] away while they stand on their feet and
[2:25:55] their eyes shall consume away in their
[2:25:57] holes and their tongue shall consume
[2:25:59] away in their mouth.
[2:26:03] This is actually
[2:26:05] describing nuclear war warfare.
[2:26:11] This is where we're at. This is what the
[2:26:13] Bible said will happen. This will be the
[2:26:15] plague in the last days.
[2:26:18] Now, do you know, do you know right now
[2:26:21] we have in the world on the world scene
[2:26:24] Iran and we keep hearing about the
[2:26:26] Iranians and the Iranian. You know why
[2:26:29] they're there is because in the Bible
[2:26:32] they were Persia
[2:26:34] and they were known as Persia until
[2:26:38] 1935. And that Persia is mentioned in
[2:26:41] several end time prophecies. For
[2:26:43] example, Ezekiel 38:5 talks about pers
[2:26:47] uh Persia Kush and Put will be with them
[2:26:50] and and their shields and their helmet.
[2:26:52] Now, and and this is describing part of
[2:26:55] the famous Gog and Magog war prophecy
[2:26:59] where a confederation of nation comes
[2:27:02] against Israel in the last days. Now,
[2:27:04] there's also in the book of Revelation,
[2:27:07] I think it's over in 17 where it talks
[2:27:09] about uh Gog and Magog, but that's
[2:27:12] describing a battle on the other side of
[2:27:14] the tribulation. But before the
[2:27:17] tribulation, you're going to see you're
[2:27:20] going to see uh this Gog and Magog in
[2:27:24] prophecy where confederations of nations
[2:27:27] comes against Israel in the last days.
[2:27:30] Remember, they are going to be
[2:27:32] persecuted by the beast and he will he
[2:27:35] will he will spit out of his mouth
[2:27:38] floods, armies
[2:27:41] against them. Now, so Persia and Iran is
[2:27:46] mentioned as one of the aggressors.
[2:27:52] Now, brother Brandham uses the name Gog
[2:27:55] and Magog war as a precursor for the
[2:27:58] final battles before the tribulation
[2:28:00] which is known as Armageddon. So, this
[2:28:02] will lead into Armageddon. And he said,
[2:28:06] will E asked the question, will Ezekiel
[2:28:09] 38:9 come to pass before the rapture?
[2:28:11] Now you'll notice Ezekiel 38 and 39
[2:28:14] deals with Gog and Magog which is Russia
[2:28:16] the north country. Now I don't say this
[2:28:19] is correct but my way of teaching it
[2:28:21] that it comes to pass after the rapture
[2:28:23] after the church is taken up and God
[2:28:25] deals with Gog and Magog when they come
[2:28:27] down before Israel there and I think
[2:28:29] that will come to pass after the
[2:28:32] rapture. So again he identifies it as
[2:28:36] Russia and he said it's communism
[2:28:39] gathered together and remember this is
[2:28:42] part of the seven con continuous visions
[2:28:45] fascism and Nazism be swallowed up by
[2:28:48] communism and now communism gathered
[2:28:51] there God said Gog and Magog there will
[2:28:53] gather together to bring about the
[2:28:55] battle that's exactly true because it's
[2:28:57] going to bring these forces together it
[2:28:58] has to come the Bible said it would
[2:29:02] So you know this is happens on this side
[2:29:05] because there ain't no such thing as a
[2:29:07] country of Russia when you get on the
[2:29:09] other side of the millennium.
[2:29:12] So again it's in Revelation 20 and verse
[2:29:16] 7-10 you can see after the millennium
[2:29:19] that in the final rebellion there will
[2:29:21] be the Gog and Magog that that appears
[2:29:24] again but before it is this is a
[2:29:26] precursor. So there are chapters in the
[2:29:29] Bible that actually describes a massive
[2:29:32] invasion of Israel by
[2:29:35] coalition including Iran, Persia, Mog,
[2:29:39] which is Russia and others. And God
[2:29:43] supernaturally defends Israel.
[2:29:47] And and you as you see that that it will
[2:29:50] happen, you know, in a climatic event
[2:29:53] where there will be a great earthquake
[2:29:55] and God will provide a way of escape. So
[2:29:58] Jeremiah chapter 49 speaks of this. You
[2:30:01] can write that again again where it from
[2:30:04] verses 34 through39 that it speaks a
[2:30:07] judgment against Elum which is now
[2:30:11] western Iran and um it is it is home to
[2:30:15] a huge nuclear factory right now today
[2:30:19] and and so he says in verse 36 I'll
[2:30:22] bring the four winds from the four
[2:30:25] corners of the earth and of course you
[2:30:27] know it will wars is flight from all
[2:30:30] actions and I will break Elum before
[2:30:33] their enemies and send a sword after
[2:30:35] them. So God says he's going to judge
[2:30:37] them. He said, I will set my throne in
[2:30:39] Elum and will destroy against the kings
[2:30:41] and the princes. And so he mentions Iran
[2:30:45] as a major enemy of Israel in the last
[2:30:48] day. and he foretells a massive assault
[2:30:51] on Israel with Persia involved under
[2:30:54] Russian leadership and promises that God
[2:30:57] himself will fight for them and
[2:31:00] supernaturally destroy these armies. So
[2:31:03] again, it's a precursor to the battle of
[2:31:06] Armageddon, which is the final conflict
[2:31:08] which will which will end and and usher
[2:31:13] in the coming of the Lord in Revelation
[2:31:15] 19. So right now we are in the
[2:31:18] fulfillment of prophecy as the stage is
[2:31:22] now set with all the players on the
[2:31:26] stage.
[2:31:28] Amen. Even right now, who is Trump
[2:31:30] dealing with? He's dealing with the iron
[2:31:32] curtain, the bamboo curtain, and the
[2:31:35] iron curtain.
[2:31:37] The iron curtain and and the purple
[2:31:39] curtain. He's dealing with all of them
[2:31:42] right now. That's right. What are we
[2:31:44] dealing with in this last day? All of
[2:31:46] these together at this very time, the
[2:31:49] stage is set. Iran's in its place.
[2:31:52] Israel's in its place. Here, Russia's in
[2:31:54] his place. Here, all of these are
[2:31:56] sitting right there. They're players on
[2:31:58] the stage.
[2:32:00] The winds of strife are beginning to
[2:32:03] blow. The devil is there trying to force
[2:32:05] you out of your position, but the bride
[2:32:08] will go to her position in the heavens.
[2:32:10] She will not lose her position. you will
[2:32:13] gain the heavenlies. Amen. Are you with
[2:32:15] me? Amen. So there again, brother
[2:32:18] Brandham begins talking about the end
[2:32:21] time and he tells us, you know, of his
[2:32:23] seven continuous visions, he said, I I
[2:32:26] saw, you know, uh Hitler rise up and and
[2:32:31] Mussolini and I saw the different ones
[2:32:33] of fatism and nom Nazism and I saw them
[2:32:36] unite together and and predicted it all
[2:32:39] coming to communism. And finally,
[2:32:42] communism will burn the Vatican City.
[2:32:46] That's right. Do you know the Bible call
[2:32:49] says she will burn within an hour that
[2:32:52] great city? So she will burn. She'll be
[2:32:56] destroyed with a nuclear explosion.
[2:32:58] Right.
[2:33:00] And so you see the animosity, the the
[2:33:03] strife, the things that are going on,
[2:33:06] you know, uh you know, picking fights in
[2:33:08] in the world and and aggravating the
[2:33:11] great bear of Russia and on and on and
[2:33:14] on, you know, you you got going on and
[2:33:16] and winds of strife and coming against
[2:33:18] Israel and people forming together. All
[2:33:20] of this is happening. Now
[2:33:23] watch as we said before the end time,
[2:33:27] there'll be a woman. There'll be a great
[2:33:29] ruler of this nation and she'll either
[2:33:31] be president or something on that order,
[2:33:33] some great woman. And at that time,
[2:33:36] automobiles just before the coming of
[2:33:39] the Lord will be in the shape of an
[2:33:42] egg. You know, aerodynamics was not even
[2:33:45] a word back then. It's described in
[2:33:49] something that has been discovered in
[2:33:51] this last day. And I want you to see
[2:33:54] here, you have Tesla that leads the way
[2:33:57] at the hands-off driving with more than
[2:33:59] 9 billion miles having been driven with
[2:34:02] autopilot
[2:34:05] engaged. I drove to church today with
[2:34:08] lane assist and the little Honda that
[2:34:10] I'm
[2:34:12] driving. And as I did, you know, it was
[2:34:16] perfectly taking the curves and doing
[2:34:18] everything. Of course, tells you every
[2:34:20] few minutes, put your hands back on the
[2:34:21] steering wheel.
[2:34:26] But at the same time, we're here.
[2:34:29] The technology is there.
[2:34:31] I want you to see it's we listen church.
[2:34:36] The vision we are in it.
[2:34:42] You're seeing it all around you.
[2:34:45] It's time that you really come awake
[2:34:50] now. So he tells us, "I seen a woman
[2:34:54] lying vulgar as she was dominated the
[2:34:56] country and I predict that a woman will
[2:34:59] either be president or come into some
[2:35:01] great power some sort in the United
[2:35:03] States before the total annihilation of
[2:35:05] the world." Keep in mind I have said
[2:35:09] it. So you know these these are things
[2:35:13] that he talked about. I want to just he
[2:35:16] talks about women and them being out of
[2:35:18] their place and out of their position.
[2:35:20] Listen, we talk about women voting.
[2:35:22] There's nothing wrong with godly women
[2:35:24] voting.
[2:35:26] There's nothing wrong. But when you get
[2:35:30] worldly women who are who who are being
[2:35:35] who are being led around by their
[2:35:37] emotions,
[2:35:40] come on. And we got a whole nation now
[2:35:43] that has been swayed by the women's vote
[2:35:46] and everything going over to the women
[2:35:48] in her voting. She will elect the wrong
[2:35:51] person.
[2:35:54] This is how she would get in. He said,
[2:35:56] "I'm I'm hammering away. You see why I'm
[2:35:59] hammering away? I got thus sayeth the
[2:36:01] Lord."
[2:36:02] And then he says
[2:36:05] this. Then when these women help elect
[2:36:08] their own person, then I saw a great
[2:36:09] woman rise up in the United States
[2:36:12] well-dressed and beautiful but cruel in
[2:36:14] her heart. And she will either guide or
[2:36:16] lead this nation to ruination. And I got
[2:36:18] in parenthesis perhaps the Catholic
[2:36:20] Church. Science will progress,
[2:36:22] especially in the mechanical world.
[2:36:24] Automotives will continue to get like
[2:36:26] egg shape. And finally, they will build
[2:36:28] one that won't need a steering wheel.
[2:36:30] They got it now. be controlled by some
[2:36:32] other power. Then I saw the United
[2:36:34] States as one smolder and burnoff place.
[2:36:37] It'll be near the
[2:36:40] end. So where are
[2:36:45] we? Women given the right to vote
[2:36:48] elected President Kennedy.
[2:36:53] with a woman's vote, the wrong man,
[2:36:55] which will finally be watch to the full
[2:36:59] control of the Catholic Church in the
[2:37:02] United States. Then the bomb comes that
[2:37:09] explos. There's seven things predicted
[2:37:11] and five of them's already happened. You
[2:37:12] can judge for yourself how far away we
[2:37:14] are. We're near the end. If these five
[2:37:16] things happen, then the other two are
[2:37:18] bound to happen. It's got to happen. I
[2:37:20] do not think that our first Catholic
[2:37:23] president will have much effect. Now,
[2:37:25] now church, I want to get something. Why
[2:37:28] does it make a
[2:37:29] difference? What a difference? Why does
[2:37:32] it make a difference? Do you realize why
[2:37:35] our country was even founded?
[2:37:39] For freedom of religion.
[2:37:42] They came over here, the pilgrim
[2:37:44] fathers, to escape the tyranny of Rome.
[2:37:52] And now the very thing we ran away from
[2:37:57] and fled here for has now come into
[2:38:01] power. Amen.
[2:38:04] That's the reason because let me tell
[2:38:06] you, as long as Rome is not in power,
[2:38:09] she is meek and loving and looks moral
[2:38:13] and kind and oh generous and got St.
[2:38:17] Jude's Hospital and doing all kinds of
[2:38:19] good deeds and but you let her get in
[2:38:22] power.
[2:38:25] When she gets in power, she's a witch.
[2:38:29] Yes, she rules with an iron fist.
[2:38:33] Everything bows to her. I do not think
[2:38:36] Mr. Kennedy have much effect now because
[2:38:38] he'll make a wonderful president in
[2:38:40] order to bring in the others. In order
[2:38:42] to bring in the
[2:38:44] others to get the scene set just like
[2:38:47] they have in England like they did in
[2:38:48] Mexico, like they did everywhere
[2:38:50] else. There'll be a powerful woman,
[2:38:53] remember this is on tape, a powerful
[2:38:56] woman, great woman. She'll either be
[2:38:57] president or be a woman representing the
[2:39:00] Catholic Church, which I think it is,
[2:39:02] will take over here. Someday she'll rule
[2:39:04] this country. This nation is a woman's
[2:39:06] nation. Flag was made by a woman is
[2:39:08] number 13. She started out with 13
[2:39:11] stripes. 13 stars, 13 stripe, 13
[2:39:14] colonies, everything. 13 13 right on
[2:39:17] down. 13's on her silver dollars. Now
[2:39:20] everything's a 13 is number 13 appears
[2:39:22] in the 13th chapter of Revelation.
[2:39:24] Completely 13. Everything's a woman
[2:39:26] woman right on down. And she's took over
[2:39:29] all the offices. She's took over
[2:39:31] Hollywood. She's took over the nation.
[2:39:33] She's took over the offices. She's took
[2:39:35] over everything there is. Equal rights
[2:39:37] with men, votes with men, cousins like a
[2:39:39] man, drinks like a man, anything else.
[2:39:41] Just bait for the Catholic Church for
[2:39:43] the worship of a woman. They're already
[2:39:45] worshiping a woman. Anyhow, Mary,
[2:39:49] right?
[2:39:51] So you see here here the prophet is
[2:39:55] speaking of this and he says and I
[2:39:58] predicted and I saw a great woman
[2:40:01] standing up looking dressed in highly
[2:40:05] royals like purpose and I got in little
[2:40:09] parentheses here she's a great ruler in
[2:40:11] the United States perhaps the Catholic
[2:40:13] church some a woman some woman I don't
[2:40:15] know her to be the Catholic church I
[2:40:16] don't know I can't say only thing I seen
[2:40:18] I seen the woman that was all this is a
[2:40:20] woman's nation. This one na nation is
[2:40:24] number 13 in prophecy. Got 13 stripes,
[2:40:26] 13 stars turns 13 colonies, 1313.
[2:40:30] Everything's 13. Appears in the 13th
[2:40:32] chapter of Revelation, she's 13. She's a
[2:40:34] woman's nation. So he says, I saw her
[2:40:37] stand
[2:40:39] up. And guess what? When we have one
[2:40:43] elected, look how she gets
[2:40:47] inaugurated in royal purple.
[2:40:50] dressed and highly royals, light
[2:40:55] purple. 1933, this is a woman's nation.
[2:40:59] Number 13, it appears in the 13th
[2:41:02] chapter. Everything's a 13. Everything's
[2:41:05] a woman. Remember, thus sayith the Lord.
[2:41:07] There will be a woman ruled before the
[2:41:09] end times. She'll either be
[2:41:11] president, vice president, or be the
[2:41:14] Catholic Church as a woman. I've seen
[2:41:16] her. A great woman the nation bowed to
[2:41:18] her. It'll be one before the end time.
[2:41:21] Thus sayeth the Lord. Write it down.
[2:41:23] Find out you young people. See if it
[2:41:25] happens. If it isn't, I'm a false
[2:41:26] prophet.
[2:41:29] So he saw it how she was dressed and
[2:41:32] said she would either be president, vice
[2:41:35] president or it'd be the Catholic
[2:41:39] Church. Cuz as he looks, he can't tell.
[2:41:43] Is it the church or is it the woman?
[2:41:45] What is it?
[2:41:47] And it turns out it's both
[2:41:52] a Catholic controlled nation. That's
[2:41:55] where we are.
[2:42:00] Let me back up just for a minute. I want
[2:42:03] to go through some things. You see her
[2:42:06] in her
[2:42:07] dress? You know why she chose purple?
[2:42:12] Because
[2:42:14] purple is a reference to woman's
[2:42:18] suffrage, the right to women's
[2:42:22] votes. So the very
[2:42:24] symbol of how she got to this
[2:42:28] position was fortold by the prophet
[2:42:31] saying the right to women voting would
[2:42:36] put her in
[2:42:37] position. And here she would be dressed.
[2:42:40] And this is the way that she would be
[2:42:43] dressed. And it would come to represent
[2:42:47] richness and
[2:42:49] affluence. And and it would represent
[2:42:52] the women's suffrage movement and the
[2:42:56] decadesl long battle for the right to
[2:42:58] women to vote. This is the very thing
[2:43:00] that the prophet said would get her in.
[2:43:03] And here she wears purple to represent
[2:43:06] that.
[2:43:08] Now church, we got too many pieces
[2:43:12] not to see this as part of the vision.
[2:43:18] We're here. We've
[2:43:20] arrived. We got the day and it set the
[2:43:23] stage until now we have coming in a
[2:43:28] Catholic controlled nation. It is
[2:43:31] documented now in the Trump
[2:43:33] administration in his cabinet that it's
[2:43:36] the most Catholic cabinet in US history.
[2:43:42] While awarding the cross to President
[2:43:44] Trump, the Archbishop, I can't pronounce
[2:43:46] his name. If you can, you're better man
[2:43:48] than I compared Trump to Constantine the
[2:43:52] Great, the one who brought them all
[2:43:54] together. Unity, confederation.
[2:43:57] What did brother Brandham tell us over
[2:43:59] and over again that was going to bring
[2:44:01] about the end time process would be the
[2:44:04] church's uniting together the the spirit
[2:44:07] of uniting confederation to joining
[2:44:10] together look and he compared him to
[2:44:13] Constantine the great who united church
[2:44:15] and state together and they actually
[2:44:17] awarded him award of a cross saying I
[2:44:21] compare you to Constantine the great and
[2:44:25] now Six of the nine Supreme Court
[2:44:29] justices are Roman Catholics. So you got
[2:44:31] all through his cabinet, even to his
[2:44:34] spokesman, the woman who who is his
[2:44:36] press secretary to Mark Marco Rubio to
[2:44:39] the secretary of state and on and on and
[2:44:42] on. You got them all just lined up in
[2:44:45] the cabinet. Roman Catholics filled more
[2:44:48] than ever before. We have been taken
[2:44:51] over. That's right.
[2:44:54] So, well, one day, Brother T. No, we're
[2:44:56] here.
[2:45:00] She's sitting right there on the throne
[2:45:02] today in this country. Remember, just
[2:45:03] like Ahab did, Jezebel behind him. The
[2:45:06] Bible calls the Catholic Church Jezebel,
[2:45:08] prostitute. And Ahab wasn't a bad guy. I
[2:45:10] don't say Mr. Kennedy isn't a nice man.
[2:45:12] Know nothing about him. He's a He's a
[2:45:14] man. That's all I know. He's a
[2:45:15] president. I believe he'll make a good
[2:45:17] one. It's not
[2:45:18] him. It's the system behind him. Wait
[2:45:21] till she gets wormed into the cabinet
[2:45:24] and everything where she can. Then watch
[2:45:28] what happened.
[2:45:32] And here we are.
[2:45:35] We have arrived.
[2:45:37] We're at the
[2:45:39] time. This United States always been
[2:45:41] number 13. 13 states, colonies, stars,
[2:45:46] stripes. Number 13, always a woman. She
[2:45:49] appears in 13th chapter first the lamb
[2:45:52] meekness, freedom of speech, freedom of
[2:45:54] religion, so forth and then received
[2:45:56] power and spake with all the power of
[2:45:58] the dragon. We had before him and what
[2:46:00] was the dragon? Rome. He had a mark in
[2:46:03] the image of the beast to rise up in the
[2:46:05] real church. So right out of the United
[2:46:07] States rises the image to the beast. So
[2:46:10] now brother Bradom makes this statement
[2:46:12] and I this is one reason it's going all
[2:46:15] everywhere. It's gone viral. Everybody's
[2:46:18] talking about it. But this what this one
[2:46:20] quote I believe one of these glorious
[2:46:22] days when this united confederation of
[2:46:25] church goes together and the new pope is
[2:46:27] brought out of the United States and put
[2:46:30] over there according to prophecy then
[2:46:32] they'll form an image like to the
[2:46:34] beast and I'll tell you the true church
[2:46:37] of God will be drove together the real
[2:46:39] true believers out of Methodist Baptist
[2:46:41] Presbyterian Pentecostal Nazarene
[2:46:43] pilgrim holiness whatever they be will
[2:46:45] go together and cemented by the love of
[2:46:47] God that'll make the body of Jesus
[2:46:49] Christ. All believers and agnostics and
[2:46:51] shallow minded will be cast to one side.
[2:46:53] They'll go right on into the
[2:46:54] Confederation of Churches. So, Brother
[2:46:57] Brandham talks about it. A new pope
[2:47:00] brought out of the United States.
[2:47:03] Now, and he said according to prophecy.
[2:47:07] Now, we already got the prophecy. That's
[2:47:09] Revelation 13.
[2:47:13] But we also have the prophecy of the
[2:47:16] woman
[2:47:18] rising up in power in America that he
[2:47:22] always identified as also being the
[2:47:26] Catholic Church
[2:47:28] and is already rising up. So here now a
[2:47:32] new pope rising up you know brought out
[2:47:36] in the United States and put over there
[2:47:38] according to prophecy. So even the
[2:47:41] visions of 33 for foretold this
[2:47:44] happening. Amen.
[2:47:47] So now we
[2:47:48] have this this cardinal is to be leave
[2:47:52] Pope Leo the
[2:47:54] 14th. And this is what he said to
[2:47:58] Chicago. He said, "Let me tell you, thus
[2:48:00] sayith the Lord, you better repent,
[2:48:02] Chicago. Your hour is close at hand.
[2:48:04] Repent. Come believe because there'll
[2:48:06] come a time that you'll cry for this and
[2:48:08] it won't be there. You won't receive a
[2:48:10] real. So there'll be a false one given
[2:48:13] you.
[2:48:15] Jesus said, "I come in my own name and
[2:48:18] you receive me not. Another will come
[2:48:20] and you will receive him." Remember, I
[2:48:23] quote its words. It's on tape. It's on
[2:48:25] record. So, Brother Brandham told
[2:48:28] because Chicago turned down the real
[2:48:32] message.
[2:48:34] You won't receive a real. So, I'll give
[2:48:36] you a false one.
[2:48:41] So, not only is he is he coming out of
[2:48:44] the United States, but coming right out
[2:48:46] of Chicago, where he prophesied
[2:48:49] a false one would rise.
[2:48:57] Now, but I want you to
[2:49:00] understand what's going to put us in our
[2:49:03] place.
[2:49:07] because national force put Israel in her
[2:49:11] place. She don't even know how she got
[2:49:14] back there. National force put her
[2:49:16] there. And he said, "I'm going to say
[2:49:17] something. National force put Israel in
[2:49:19] her homeland. National force will put
[2:49:21] the church in the world council of
[2:49:23] churches or in this spirit of unity
[2:49:25] under
[2:49:26] ecamunism. But the power of God will put
[2:49:29] the people in the bride. The world
[2:49:31] forces this way and the world forces
[2:49:33] that way. But God forces up. The spirit
[2:49:36] of God, which is the word of God, my
[2:49:38] word is spirit in life, will put the
[2:49:39] bride in her place. She'll recognize her
[2:49:42] position in the word. Then she's in
[2:49:44] Christ. Will put her in her place. No
[2:49:47] national force will do it. But national
[2:49:49] force did drive Israel to the homeland.
[2:49:52] That national forces of the council of
[2:49:54] churches will drive every organization
[2:49:56] in. But the power of God will raise the
[2:49:58] bride into glory out of it.
[2:50:02] Hallelujah. Oh, I say, let the power
[2:50:05] fall.
[2:50:07] Amen. Let the power come and put you in
[2:50:09] your position in your place into that
[2:50:12] heavenly position as a son or daughter
[2:50:15] of God. Notice
[2:50:17] this. He's called Leo, which is king.
[2:50:21] Pope Leo. Now he's beast, Antichrist,
[2:50:24] false prophet. now beast and given the
[2:50:27] name of death and hell follows him.
[2:50:29] Watch now and fully Satan on his throne.
[2:50:32] Oh my. On the earth he is Satan's
[2:50:36] representative on the earth that he is
[2:50:39] now head of the kingdoms of the world.
[2:50:41] That very kingdoms that he offered to
[2:50:43] the Lord Jesus in Matthew 4. Satan now
[2:50:46] becomes full king.
[2:50:49] That's where the world's headed. Amen.
[2:50:55] And look at the
[2:50:57] scripture. And the dragon, now we're
[2:50:59] summing up Revelation
[2:51:01] 12. And the dragon was wroth with the
[2:51:05] woman and went to make war with the
[2:51:08] remnant of her seed. Now, we already
[2:51:12] seen her after Israel and persecuting
[2:51:14] Israel and open her mouth and spitting
[2:51:16] out water like a flood. But now he turns
[2:51:20] against the woman, the remnant of her
[2:51:22] seed. and went to make war with the
[2:51:24] remnant of her seed which keep the
[2:51:26] commandments of God and have the
[2:51:29] testimony of Jesus
[2:51:32] Christ. Now we know what happens when
[2:51:35] the bride leaves from
[2:51:37] here. Then all hell is going to come
[2:51:40] against not only Israel but everyone who
[2:51:44] don't take the mark of the beast and his
[2:51:46] image and don't join it with the system.
[2:51:49] They will all go under bitter
[2:51:51] persecution and will make war against
[2:51:54] them and they will be brutally murdered.
[2:51:57] I can show you in the Bible they will be
[2:51:59] martyed and
[2:52:01] killed but not
[2:52:03] us. You say the church has to go through
[2:52:06] the persecution for the perfection of
[2:52:09] it. The blood of Jesus Christ perfects
[2:52:12] the bride. A man who chooses his wife, a
[2:52:16] wife doesn't put her through a lot of
[2:52:17] punishment. He's already found grace
[2:52:19] with her. She's found grace with him. He
[2:52:21] engages to her. And if there's anything,
[2:52:23] he'll keep for her from every place that
[2:52:25] I turn her hand. His grace is so great
[2:52:29] upon them. And so will it be upon the
[2:52:32] bride, and so is it upon the bride. And
[2:52:36] I saw the headstone coming down crying,
[2:52:39] "Grace, grace,
[2:52:41] amazing grace."
[2:52:44] Oh, church. He said we should pray
[2:52:47] always that we escape the things that
[2:52:51] are coming on the earth and to be
[2:52:53] accounted worthy to stand before the son
[2:52:56] of man, Christ now, and let him judge
[2:52:59] us. Because if we're purged now, we
[2:53:02] won't go through the purging of the
[2:53:04] tribulation.
[2:53:05] Let him cleanse you from all unbelief,
[2:53:08] from all wickedness. Serve the Lord with
[2:53:10] all your heart. We're in the last days,
[2:53:12] little children. every prophecy points
[2:53:16] to it. Let's stand
[2:53:18] together. Let the musicians
[2:53:21] come. Father, we spoke these words
[2:53:25] today. I just felt Lord just to take a
[2:53:28] little few moments today day just to to
[2:53:31] lay it out in the scripture to point it
[2:53:34] out where modern events are being made
[2:53:38] clear by the prophecy and we're making
[2:53:40] clear the modern events that are going
[2:53:43] on by the prophecies that lay in the
[2:53:46] scripture and the message that you've
[2:53:47] given us and realizing Lord the power of
[2:53:50] God puts people in the bride. Oh God, I
[2:53:54] pray in the name of Jesus, you'll do a
[2:53:57] work of grace in the lives and hearts of
[2:54:00] men and women today. Don't let any of us
[2:54:03] be left behind.
[2:54:05] Come for us,
[2:54:07] Lord. Play that song. Even come Jesus,
[2:54:11] come. Come take your bride away. Even
[2:54:14] so,
[2:54:16] come. Let's just worship the Lord just a
[2:54:19] moment.
[2:54:21] That ought to be our cry today.
[2:54:24] You can prepare for this and prepare for
[2:54:27] that. And I Hey, I
[2:54:30] say if you're preparing for home, build
[2:54:33] it. You're preparing for marriage, get
[2:54:37] married. If you're preparing for school,
[2:54:40] we tear it till he
[2:54:41] comes. But whatever, don't miss this
[2:54:44] preparation.
[2:54:47] The bride has made herself ready.
[2:54:50] Make it where the prayer that comes out
[2:54:52] of your heart is come Jesus come
[2:54:57] to you are in line with the last words
[2:54:59] of the Bible cuz you're the last
[2:55:02] people even so come Lord
[2:55:06] [Music]
[2:55:11] Jesus even
[2:55:15] so come Lord Jesus
[2:55:19] Not a day to play games.
[2:55:24] It's not a day to to be callous and
[2:55:27] rude.
[2:55:29] It's a time to realize they can cause
[2:55:34] your
[2:55:35] elections to be. If there's anything
[2:55:39] that needs
[2:55:41] purging, don't let it stay there.
[2:55:44] Get purged now. Tribulation will come.
[2:55:48] There'll be those that are purged in the
[2:55:50] tribulation. But you can stand before
[2:55:53] Christ, the word right now, and let him
[2:55:55] cleanse you. It can purge you and make
[2:55:58] you white, lost, white as the snow.
[2:56:03] If there's a lack of dedication in your
[2:56:05] life, dedicate it right now.
[2:56:08] Be like
[2:56:09] Enoch whose name meant dedication.
[2:56:14] Call upon the name of the Lord.
[2:56:17] You will be saved.
[2:56:20] Oh yes with
[2:56:23] you

[2:56:31] so. Even
[2:56:34] so. Come on Jesus.

[2:56:45] you today.
[2:56:48] I just showed you the vision.
[2:56:51] Where are you in the vision?
[2:56:55] Will you be part of those first in the
[2:56:57] tribulation?
[2:56:59] Or will you be those
[2:57:01] elected called in this day to be with
[2:57:05] you who take your place with the
[2:57:08] redeemed of all the ages?
[2:57:11] Are you just in the righteous acts of
[2:57:13] the saints. Are you prepared to beat the
[2:57:16] bridegroom?
[2:57:20] We invite you today to your life. One
[2:57:23] more
[2:57:24] time. Even
[2:57:27] so, follow Jesus.
[2:57:33] Amen. Even
[2:57:36] so, you carry your bride away.
[2:57:42] Amen. How I
[2:57:45] say long to be with you my
[2:57:54] soul.

[3:07:09] And when the

[3:09:55] go. Oh Jesus got a hold of my life and
