branches the weary the lost the sick the dying can come and take fry and find refuge amen god bless you we appreciate you today let's talk to the lord maybe you've got a need in your heart in your life that you would just like to say lord speak to me in a special way today lord jesus we are here gathered in your name and we're just asking your blessings upon us now as we look into the word of god we hear the word a promise that says we can go free lord that there is no need to remain bound in our unbelief and ours in our darkness or our confusion or out in our sins but lord we can go free we can be uninhibited by all of the troubles of life we can overcome the scars along the journey that we have experienced we can rise above the bitterness and the disappointments of life because we can go free and i'm asking lord that you would anoint us today anoint us by your spirit anoint the word lord as it goes forth knowing hearts and lives to believe your promise lord as we look into the word i pray that you'd anoint it but lord anoint me too father and yet it would not be complete without you anointing this audience may lord we be anointed together and brother aaron who's out

down in the ukraine lord the believers that have fled to poland trying to find refuge there and the different ones lord they oh god they come to trust under the shadows of your wings today lord we're under the feathers of your wings there's no bombs can strike nothing can destroy lord even even if a bomb would it would only usher us right into the glories of god i pray loud father that you'll bless your people the people that are around the world today those that are listening in that are part of this service today bless them in a mighty way we ask in jesus name amen amen god bless you turn with me to genesis chapter 17 we're going to read from the first verse we welcome each one of you today in the name of the lord jesus those of you that are visitors here with us today we're happy to have you those of you that you know you're you're adjustment there huh okay well god bless you amen we're alive i mean feel alive now all right well let's just respond to the things of god today let's turn to as i said to genesis 17 we'll read from verse one and when abram was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceededly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and i seed after thee and their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the lamb were in thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god and god said unto abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee and their generations this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed even after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you and he that is 88 days old it shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house are bought with money of a stranger which is not thy seed he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant and the uncircumcised man-child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant and god said unto abraham as for sarah thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarai but sarah shall her name be and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of people shall be of her then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old and shall sarah that is ninety-year-old old bear and abraham said unto god all that ishmael might live before thee and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation but my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham may god bless you you can be seated amen thank you brother johnny god bless you church today as we look into the promises of the word of the lord and you know i was speaking in my last sermon here which was a couple of weeks ago about this being the age of pentecost and i was speaking of the returning to the original grain as it was on the day of pentecost you know god planted a seed there at pentecost and he's bringing forth a harvest in this last day now i was not speaking of azusa street um brother branham has said of them but this is another age this is a calling out of the bride not two thousand years ago at pentecost for the repeated return then he would say this is not the day of pentecost the pentecostal age is passed pentecost is gone this is a harvest time and and again in the church age book he would he would give this thought the lutheran age was springtime the westland age was the summer of growth the laodicean age is the harvest of the and the gathering of tares for the burning and binding and burning and the garnering of the wheat for the lord so if you'll notice in this last age there is a there is a gathering that takes place a harvest time and we are in a very great harvest season right now as um everything comes to its height um you see sin reaching its height it does it like it did also in the book of genesis and abraham's time where that the sins of sodom reached its height until god heard it in the heavens and we we know again in the book of revelation that the sins again reach until the the um sins are heard in the heavens and so you see everything comes to its harvest season and in this harvest season um you know there is the gathering it will be the gathering of the tares jesus would use this um parable because it would be the wheat sowed the grain sowed the good seed by the son of man and then there would be the tares that would be sung by the wicked one and so there would be a binding and a burning of the tares and then a garnering of the wheat and to the for the lord so as you as you look at this a garnering simply means to gather into the barn and and so it speaks of a a rapture it's not a planting time again but it is a harvest time where is carried into the barn so it's not a receding so you know we we would see the different things for example um you you see the dying of luther as the life would move from the from the stark into the tussle the dine of luther brought forth wesley and then the dying of wesley brought forth um the asus movement and then the the dying of the azusa movement brings forth the message now all the life goes into the grain for the harvest this is a time where where um you know where that everything reaches its place of maturity but being you know that being said don't forget what the church had at pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word of god and she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and gifts of the spirit and that is our inalienable rights and so thus what the church was at pentecost is the standard so that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what scholars say god has not changed that pattern what god did at pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages in and those scholars may tell you that the apostolic age is over don't you ever believe it amen this is a point that brother branham would defend over and over and over again that um the apostolic age was continuing on and would never cease until the last one was saved and and so mark 16 would still be in effect these signs will follow them that believe so again you know we we're at a time where all of the types are being fulfilled even even what happened on the day of pentecost 2 000 years ago was projecting of another pentecost and we're not referring another to azusa street where we're referring to this last day move of god and remember in that day the day of pentecost had fully come and that meant that the seven weeks from the passover had been fulfilled and now it had fully come the feast of weeks had given away and from from the 49th day into the 50th which was pentecost and when the day of pentecost fully came the the spirit of god came down from heaven with a mighty rushing wind and there it filled the house where they were sitting and and they were filled with the holy ghost and there the the pillar of fire would give birth as cloven tongues like fire would come and now it wasn't just the fullness of god in the man christ jesus but now his fullness would be experienced in a bright body and so again you know we are we're now aware that the day of pentecost has fully come we have come through seven weeks or seven church ages and we are now here at the fulfillment of all the scriptures that have been pointing to this time so again again now the day of pentecost has truly fully come and it comes with a harvest again it comes with the waving of a sheath it comes with a celebration of the what god has done in his in his stages of redemption so again this is where we are here now at the final jubilee it is where that god empties out his spirit and pours it out upon all flesh now as we are seeing this the the day of pentecost brother branham would say the spirit of god directed it into that joel 2 28 and the day of luther directed into that which was justification and wesley directed into the holiness movement we'll speak about that here in a moment but this is another age this is the calling out of the bride amen not 2 000 years ago at pentecost for the repeat or even the returns you see we're not repeating pentecost of 2 000 years ago because that was the church being planted as a corn of wheat and it would go down through persecution and dying out through the dark ages and would come up again with luther there uh like a blade of wheat doesn't look nothing like the grain doesn't look like the seed that was but it was still the the life that was in the grain now manifested in another form it's not ready for the harvest it's a young tender blade and then you know if you if you cut it now if you harvest it now you just got hay right amen you don't have the original grain again but again it keeps on moving from that and it progresses until it becomes like like the growth of the wheat and we'll read the bible for this in a moment but you know like the growth of the weed it'll come into the next stage from the blade to the torso which would be john wesley and the movement of the holy spirit of god uh again in the the methodist revival and the and the holiness revival it was branch out into the nazarenes and the pilgrim holiness and and other other moves of god and and then and then that that would again you know the life would leave that and be pushed on into the into another stage and that other stage would be a shuck and that chuck would look exactly like the original grain but it wasn't grain it's kind of like going out and harvesting your sweet corn and you see it it's got a it's got a beautiful ear of corn and you go and you pull it back and all you've got is little bitty tiny grains that you can't eat a white cob right it's not harvest time amen but it looks it looks like it looks like it would have grain in it but it doesn't have grain yet then it puts on the full ear so you see we are not repeating pentecostal 2 000 years ago because thank god we're not going to be planted and we're not going to go to 2 000 more years of church ages and man you know the weeks are over here the tights have run out so you see we we again we're not repeating that because this is where it is the harvest time and it goes into the corner of this storehouse and i want to say neither are we trying to uh are attempting to try to reproduce a souza street movement because they were the shock now so again it wasn't a rapture age but we are in a rapture rate this is age of the fulfillment of all scriptures and so it's very important for us to understand you know again where we are in time and what god is doing in this hour to be a part of the move of god not it not in the dried dead parts of the plant before though god used to move there but god's not moving there his advanced beyond that now so the church has come up like a gray that we planted on the day of pentecost and is now back to the grain again and this time to be taken into the garner and or be raptured now so the the kingdom of god is like a seed jesus said now you say well brother tim i need scripture for where you're placing this well i'll i'll just go to mark chapter 4 and verse 26 and we're going to read this together today and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed into the ground and he should sleep and should rise day and night and the seeds will spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the earth bringeth forth the fruit of herself first the blade then the ear and after that the full cord in the ear but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because harvest is come so you see when it comes back to grain again you know it's harvest time you know the sickle is about to be put in the field and there's going to be a reaping you see whatever was sowed has got to be reaped so the sins that were sowed before and the sins of sodom reach the sodom harvest amen this is why that we're seeing this is because the seeds were sung and yet yet again when you when you look and you see the other other things coming up the tears among the wheat then you know the wheat had to or the the terror had to grow until the harvest time and then the harvest time there would come a separation so we're in a time where god is separating a people to himself back to the word again that's why we're here this morning so the bible is saying jesus said it comes to the seed the blade the ear the full corn in the ear now that's where the full word is born into manifestation you see we we've had a bible now that has been given to us um since the days of luther you say since the days of luther yes before that they were in the cloisters of rome and nobody got to read the bible nobody had the word of god and if they did you had to be trained in either greek or it was translated into latin so if you didn't know greek or latin you were still you know out you can look at the words but you don't know what they mean but then luther would bring us a bible and we've had the bible now for years but because of the lack of the word being there then all kinds of misconceptions had come and clouded over the word and many of these traditions were brought off brought over from rome where they had distinguished the word of god the bible the bible is not even known among the people and so they they had kept the truths up down and they it was now whatever the church said and whatever the church believed and what if the church wanted you to believe so again you know god would start a process of restoration i'm trying to make this as simple as i know how for every person here but now so this it comes finally to where the full word as it comes partially revealed back in luther with wesley and then azusa street but there has to come a time where the full word of god is born into manifestation now it'll be out of this full word that full sons come amen that adopted son men who know their god come out of that full word they're born of that word it's not a partial truth it's the whole truth amen and it comes down to full redemption this is what seven angels in the cloud represented there that all the seven ages were finished and the word of god was being revealed amen because now we don't have this one age we have every truth of the ages coming down into a single message as brother branham would often say i'm i'm i'm taking and i'm i'm i'm the tying to loose ends together this shred of truth that luther had and the shred that wesley had and the thread that azusa street had the sweat that all these others had and i'm taking all these strands of truth and i'm weaving them into one message amen so you could have the flower to claw and out of that full word of god would be a people that would be born of that word amen amen of people who would know their god they might know his truth know him in all of his reality i mean those people would do exploits [Music] now i've come to that point right there for us to go back to the life of abraham for a moment and i'm going to just use some of that this morning i don't know how much i'll get to this today but we'll just follow as the holy spirit moves but i want to come back to the prophecy of abraham you say prophecy of abraham yes it is prophetical it's more than a book of history is more than just um you know the the father of the jews abraham is our father and i want you to know he is our father because from him came christ the royal seed and out of him we are born so we who were outside of that covenant have received another covenant and we have been brought into a covenant with christ now when we look back here we are looking at a man that is absolutely in his life prophesying our day our our time and this is why brother branham would often go in his sermons to to abraham over and over and over again because abraham was speaking of us as he said in christ the mystery of god revealed he said these men were prophesying now they didn't know they were prophesying you know abraham didn't say now i'll tell you what i'm going to do i'm going to go up and offer my son isaac because i'm prophesying that there's a seed coming and so i'm gonna i'm gonna go through this act and i'm gonna pretend that it was not pretending you see abraham was told to do something because he would be prophesying now are you with me he'd be prophesying about the coming of the seed and and so it would be it would be abraham that god would use to foreshadow you coming you had to be written in the bible and you're going to have to see the bible is more than just a book you've got to see it as prophesying of you you know you'll never get healed unless you see the word is personally talking to you we can preach it all you want to but until it becomes your personal revelation your faith will never be elevated to receive it but it's got to be brought to where that you see yourself in the promise now so coming back to the prophecy of abraham he actually comes through different stations where he experienced god and as he journeyed as he walked through the promised land now as god dealt with abraham so does he deal with his seed and we are abraham seed now let's establish that because what does this have to do what i read about abraham have to do with us today well let's look in the bible and see what he has to do galatians chapter 3 in verse 16 now to abraham and his seed were the promises me so i want you to give to abraham and his seed say it with me abraham and his seed all right it wasn't just given to abraham it's given to abraham and his seed all right he saith not and to seeds plural he didn't say i've given to abraham and his seeds as many but as a one and to that seed which is christ so all the promises were speaking of christ amen now if you're not born of christ you're not going to be a recipient of abraham's promises now then let's look at down at verse 29 and if you be christ how many belong to christ then you are abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so now if you belong to christ you're abraham's seed amen you can look at your neighbor and say i'm seated of abraham amen so because of being abraham's seed i'm heirs to the promise amen i am ash to everything that abraham had so when we look back at abraham he is prophesying of his seed and the blessing that will come on his seat amen now first of all abram was found by god in the era of the child of the uh in arab chaldea a gentile he was a heathen a worshipers of idols and i want you to get this god sought him out [Applause] he was like everybody else a worldly sinner bound for hell like everybody else but god sought him out hallelujah that ought to make you shout this morning oh man it wasn't nothing he did it wasn't how good he was amen it was god called him god predestinated god ordained him hallelujah amen god sought him god called him i want you to know salvation is of the lord it ain't out of you it ain't your desire it ain't your good work it is god that dropped you it is god that called you it's god that predestinated you it's god that said i have a rapture for you i need a little more sound up here now abram was found by god a gentile heathen he didn't know how to worship he didn't know how many gods there were there were multiple of gods that was idle idolatry everything else he was a man just like the others going about his business and one day god appeared to him sometimes it takes a long time for god to appear to him sometimes a man can be up in his 80s for god appears to him but god appears he's not going to lose one of his own amen it might have been are you with me now if you may have been going along a long time and it seemed like it's been a real drought but let me tell you god will appear amen and then i want you to notice in verse chapter 12 and verse 1 the lord had said to abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house and to the land that i will show you now if you're going if you you see i've called you but i've not called you to remain where you are i have not called you to remain in your sins i have not called you to remain a heathen i have not called you to to still be an idolatry and worshipping other idols or idols i didn't call you to stay where you're at god if you don't get anything out of this service today but this god has not called you for you to stay where you're at you cannot remain where you are there has to be a growth in your life there has to be a progression in your life and many of you have become squatters where you're at amen and you know what abraham did or abram did when he left from there he he took it took a long lot his brother and his brother's son and tyra his his father and brought them and brought them along with them god didn't tell them to come he told abram to come he said leave that listen you see you've got to leave friends behind you've got to leave finally behind you've got to leave everything behind you're going to follow the lord you can't you can't let it try to pray all that with you people want to serve god and hang on to their old things you can't do it it's you know god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief now so he would say in in genesis 13 7 arise and walk to command arise and walk you know some of you got to get up from where you're at you've been there in that place way too long you've been in that sin you've been in that wickedness you've been in that unbelief the first thing the first step is get out arise up out of there you say well i can't do it well he said you could do it if god said arise and god provides the grace and the power for you to arise [Applause] and then he said walk yeah yeah put a foot in front of you and walk through the land look i've given you a line i've given you promises but i want you to start walking through these promises i want you to see what you're what you're inheriting i'm going to give you something if there is healing and there is miracles and there's salvation in there is your children in there it is abundance and there is blessings and there is everything but i want you to get out and walk through this land and claim every bit of it as your own so you don't yet see it though you don't say i've got victory over that yet you go to claiming that victory you say i haven't seen that healing that you're going to claim in that healing i see my children come back you're going to claim those children you've got to walk through the land kind of go into the promises look in the scripture it's speaking about you it's abraham i'm giving these promises so walk through the liv the lamb genesis 13 17. walk to rise walk through the land in the length of it the breath of it for i will give it unto thee i will give it you're not going to have to work for it it's all going to be by grace my favorite i want you to get that thought my favor my grace is great upon you you are highly favored of the law now we've got to walk through the land of god's promises and see what's in it we've got to experience the wonders of it and in every place digital well and build an altar hallelujah in every place are you with me you dig it well and you build an altar amen why the well you gotta have the water of the spirit you've got to have the holy ghost moving upon you you've got to have a refreshing from the presence of the lord and that will cause you to build an altar and worship god amen all right now but don't stop there these are stations there's more of the land to discover that's right now i want you just to see for a moment as we type this and we look at it with the church progression now remember parallel the thought of a wheat plant along with the thought of abraham and his stations along with the restoration of the church and the church will come like a wheat plant out of an out of death in the life it'll come and it'll progress now he will show you these things now watch you got to keep walking whatever you do don't stop where you're out in fact for the matter is you walk until your body is changed and until you've reached that you've got another step to take amen that puts everybody in the same place today you've got to take another step amen i don't care how long you've been a christian i i don't care how many merits that we can put on the board for you and awards we can give you i want you to understand something with real clear you have not arrived and you must keep going and if you got here it was by grace and grace will give you the power to take another step some people just need to take the step of repentance another might need the step of baptism in his name there's only one name that you can be saved and that's the name of jesus christ salvation baptism the part of salvation so you must be baptized in the name of jesus christ for remission of sin and you shall receive so there's a progression after that that's right now look here in my micah chapter 6 and verse 8 micah 6-8 he has showed you a man what is good and what the lord does require of thee i mean he wants to know what he wants art to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly before your god so this is what god requires of every man walk humbly before me this is where he calls abraham walk humbly walk before me and be thou perfect so so again he would say this in genesis 17 1 walk before me and be thou perfect so god is calling you to perfection amen he calls you to adoption to the change of your body he calls you to a resurrection he calls you that's why i'm saying he is calling for you take another step now oh to be a man that god walks with he said walk before me and be thou perfect oh to be a man that god walks with it's more than a song he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me that i'm his own god wants somebody to walk with him and he's calling you come walk through the promises of this land discover everything that i got amen i'm giving you the complete land listen philosophies may be living there now giants may be on this portion and many enemies over here and there and adversaries here and there it doesn't matter i gave it to you you said brother tim i'm sick god gave you healing but there's devils on that promise and they're howling at you trying to keep you off of them but i want you to know i want you to know that if god calls you to that mountain you can take that mountain if god gave you a promise it is your promise amen and you must look at it as my promise my word and i will not be defeated i will accept what god said about me by his strengths i am healed i will believe his report and no other [Applause] because his arm is only revealed to those who believe his report and when you do this this works righteousness amen a christian life is a journey it is not just one step you've got to keep walking ain't it walk with god that's progression enough walked with god and then he was no more because god took him away he raptured him enough walked with god to to the rapture amen he progressed amen you said brother tim now you've been preaching 52 years i've got another step to take that's right i cannot rest on my laurels or my accomplishments or what i did in the past and i must press toward the mark for the prize of the high court i must never give up amen you say because i cannot do it until god takes me away and neither can you now this kind of walking is a person who's moving forward and it's one step at a time some are little steps some are giant steps but they're all steps but this person moving forward is consumed with the journey itself and it was so consumed think about it walking with god the bible said he walked with god and was not so he was so consumed with his companion god being his companion on the journey he didn't even question where they were going you know many times we get into situations well god where are we going what are we going to do i've done that i guarantee you since mr cameron passed away i said well what now lord where do you want me to go what to do you know how where why am i here how come this is happening why is this like this right am didn't question he he just walked with god amen wherever you're leading me i'm going to follow i don't question where you're leading me [Applause] amen i just trust amen you brought me here for a reason amen amen you say but brother tim in this place i'm out this sickness he brought you here for a reason and here is a challenge god brought you here for a reason you are here for a purpose god has brought listen god is not the author of frustration he is the author of peace and so he brings you to a place for a reason where that you can know god in a greater way than you ever know him you would never know him as a cancer to peter if you never had cancer you know and the church here will never know him as a cancer defeater you know unless we face cancer and defeated it and we have and we will again amen i said we will again amen because the angel in charge said nothing would stand against our prayers not even cancer so we well again that's right that's good enoch is so consumed with his companion just in love with the lord that's right along the journey don't question why me lord how come i'm in this place why don't why did this happen to me oh woe is me oh you know god doesn't love me it didn't happen none of that come on he walked with god he didn't question don't question where you're at just look around and see if god's there grace will never bring you to a place that grace cannot keep you so he says he is he he is every step now he's drawn closer and closer with god and god's saying walk with me walk deeply with me let me permeate every part of who you are let's go somewhere together along the way we'll talk we'll have joyful times and laugh together god's got emotions the bible said that god laughed the bible said that god cries the bible come on somebody the bible talks about god he's not a a merciless spirit there he's god and he has he he when he became a man he could weep we went with the with the those that had lost a loved one he could he could rejoice with those he could shout he could lift up his voice come on church this is god and as we go along we laugh together we'll cry together and but with each death we have faith that god has taken us to the place he wants us to be and one day we'll walk all the way to his house [Applause] and never give up till you're there that's the time you can rest that's the time you can quit walking so as you walk you come to different places in your journey or different stages in life or you're a christian experience and we'll call these stages or places as i said abraham would come down he'd build an altar call on the name of the lord god would be revealed to him in a special way so you come to different stages or places in your journey your christian journey and we'll call the stages of the church and even your individual stage justification where sins are forgiven sanctification that's the cleansing from evil habits and then the baptism of the holy ghost where god comes to dwell in you and you keep on walking right onto the resurrection or the body change now the divine call it was not abraham seeking god but it was god calling man god seeking man it had nothing to do with him being more worthier than anyone else let's go back into verse 2 of chapter 12 of genesis and i want you to watch these four words and i will make i want you to see again this is not your own efforts this is god doing something in your life i am going to do this you see i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee amen i hope you're reading these as your own amen and he said and i will make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curses thee and indeed shall all the families of the earth be blessed now this was given to abraham it was a sovereign call you see no man seeketh after god no not one the bible says god seeking after man abraham is not justified by works but by his faith you see you can never be good enough to be to deserve or receive anything from god never it is never i mean you say well you know this happened to me and i've been a faithful christian you see it has nothing to do with how long you've been a christian it has everything to do with you believing if whatever he can give you to believe that's yours [Applause] that's why the discernment gift was given we would go back in a life with brother branham and could tell somebody what happened 40 years ago and that their street address and their and their problem and what the doctor said described the doctor and everything else he he said it was like like taking a a a musical instrument like a guitar a tune in the strength you heard the other day when when brother wendell was saying well he's drummed his guitar and there's there's something out of tune well it isn't that there isn't a string it isn't that it isn't a guitar it isn't that you're not a christian it isn't that you don't have faith your faith is out of tune and it won't reach the melody and the harmony that matches god's word so what did he do he took the little key there and he twisted it around until that match the note for the song and there are scriptures laying in the word of god and you may be a christian you may have faith you've got the guitar you got the string but you see you need it tuning up until what you are saying matches what's on god's word because you got the you got the music sheet and it says this certain note for this certain place and so you've got to tune it where that it matches are you with me that's what god's had to do with our faith amen we are going through things because god is tuning our faith your faith has been way down here and then it's just totally out of tune you can never match the promise of the word of god you also put it here in the bible and we our faith has got to match it [Music] that's what malachi 4 was to do who was to lift your faith another level to rapture in faith [Music] hallelujah now so is god's sovereign call and abraham was not justified by his works but by his faith as i said you cannot be good enough to deserve anything from god well i'll become a christian when i get good enough no that's not how you come you come to god just as you are but not to stay as you are a lot of people sang just as i am and said god you just got to take me just the way i am because that's just me and that's just the way i'm going to be so if you want me god come get me but i want you to understand you're taking me just as i am i i'm not going to change i'm still going to have my liquor i'm still going to have my beers i'm still going to have my worldly friends i'm still going to i'm still going to listen to worldly music i'm still going to do whatever i want to do because god you're taking me just as i am that's not what that means it means that i am undeserving of life i'm undeserving of salvation i'm in this pitiful condition and i can't help myself but i'm coming as a sinner just as i am and i don't have one plea of my own righteousness or goodness or deserving anything but just this one plea that your blood was shed for me amen now so you see in romans chapter 4 and verse 2 if abraham was justified when you see that word justified you have to think what that means it means made righteous so when we say in justification we mean it was there god made you righteous didn't say you were righteous god made you that way he made you that way by his blood being shed in your place and his your your sins your sins were exchanged for his righteousness now if abraham was justified by works if he was made righteous by works he had whereup to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted on him for righteousness so you see the way that we get righteous is through our faith believing god it's not our it's not not our works if we're made righteous by our works we did good deeds i carried sweet potato to the widow i uh i helped the uh you know i while i donated to the fund for ukraine war and i've done this and i've you're not saved by none of that you're not saved by hail mary's and and and the penance and that that's not salvation amen it is not works that you do you come to god just as you are i'm a sinner i need a savior nobody can be saved until they first realize i'm lost you can never save a man who thinks he knows where he's at amen he's got to realize i'm lost and i can't find my way out amen now i'm i'm oversimplifying this for everybody but watch none of our good deeds can earn us a place in heaven well i kept i took care of my mother and she was a saint and i know she went and i did good to her you cannot earn a place in heaven well i i i give so much money to the poor all the time i fed strangers i've done it you cannot earn a place in heaven i went to church every sunday and wednesday for 50 years you cannot earn a place in heaven i paid my tithe i've done this i've done i've done that you cannot earn a place it's all the favor of god so none of our good deeds can earn us a place in heaven we're not saved because we go to church you're not saved because you dress holy my skirt has never been above my knees in my life i don't wear this i don't wear that i hadn't put on makeup i don't i don't cut my hair i don't do this i don't you are not saved because you dress holy or because we get to the poor tithe of our income we're saved by grace through faith we are required to believe and accept god's pardon from our sins nobody can be forgiven unless they accept forgiveness and some of you just simply need to forgive yourself hey man yeah you've been stupid you've been a human right that's why you've been stupid you've done stupid things you've made awful mistakes all the water could have said it won't turn it around you've got to start right there accepting god's pardon i am forgiven there are too many christians that are going around beat down and everything else because of their past amen you will never ever achieve the things of god until you first accept god's pardon i am not a sinner i am not that is not my sins they are washed in the blood of jesus i have been cleansed i've accepted his pardon i am forgiven i don't have to hold my head down the rest of my life beat down because of something horrible in my past a lot of people say brother tim the devil said to me well first of all why are you listening to him shut his mouth up right now if you recognize the devil then go ahead and just turn it off well the devil said to me he reminded me of my past he don't have too good a past either and all you got to do is remind him of his past but i got a secret for you the devil don't have a future and you do hallelujah you're a people with the future god has a plan for you he said my plan for you my plan for you is to give you peace and not evil to bring you to an expected place amen hallelujah to bring you all the way into where that you you you you drink of the waters of life freely hell should i probably never reach this today i'm just going to take my time our deeds cannot earn us david said in romans 4 and 6 david is quoted that david describeth the man the blessedness of a man a man is blessed unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works we are blessed because god imputed righteousness without works i didn't do nothing to deserve it amen saying blessed are they whose iniquities were for are forgiven you know does anybody know what iniquities is iniquity says when i do something i do better than to do and he said what do you say his iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are what covered well this was in david's time and they had the blood of bulls and goats it could only cover sin you got a greater blood and that blood does not cover sin watch this for a moment if i if i would take him and i would and i would put a mark on the white part of this pulpit and then i would come along and i would paint over with white again oh wow the pulpits made new but behind that fresh paint is my old mark stain it's still there it's just covered over that's all the blood bulls and goats could do was cover over but the blood of jesus annihilates sin it doesn't it's not a pain to go over your sin it's a blood a bleach that completely changes every bit of it every fragment every every element of your sins listen like dropping a a drop of bleach down and or draw a drop of heat into a tub of bleach and you watch it and it just circles around and disappears it goes back and gets changed in some other form are you with me you'll never find it again it'll never become ink again it's gone because it's been dipped in the bleach the same thing happens with your sins when it's put in the bleach of the blood of jesus christ it swams around and down and down and down into the depths of that blood until it's no more you can't find a mark against you but i got a little further to go with that do you realize that your sin continues to travel until it goes back on the head of your accusers and one day satan will burn in hell for your sins hallelujah amount so they're not my sins they are his sins get behind me satan i am a child of the most high god [Applause] amen psalms 103 and 8 god the lord is merciful and gracious and slow to anger and plenteous in mercy he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger forever come on he had not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him so he's a god that is rich in mercy how much mercy as high as the heaven is from the earth it just keeps on going amen there's no stopping places israel's mercy is so high this is why after the seals brother adam could preach god is rich in mercy amen the open book didn't give us less mercy it gave us more mercy [Music] the opening of the book the taking off the seals there's mercy for souls in the altar under the fifth seal jews who died not knowing jesus there's mercy for the church who accepted christ but missed the rapture and and are found in the tribulation period there's mercy for the 144 thousand after the bride is raptured you see there's mercy mercy mercy mercy mercy for the bride mercy for the foolish virgins mercy for the 144 000 the leftover of the jews mercy for those down to the ages that didn't get a chance to know god's rich in mercy are you with me now so you see he has not dealt with us according to our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities but as a heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that reverence him amen now so in all of this and and so because of this mercy he raptures a bride we are going to be raptured because of the grace and the mercies of almighty god micah chapter 7 verse 19 he will turn again and have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and that will castled us and thou will cast all their sins into the depth of the sea amen amen so he will have compassion on you this is a god who's a compassionate god a god that is full of mercy a god that says to the to the the lowest sinner to the person closest to hell a man that i'm not going to reward you according to your works i'm going to reward you according to my mercy amen i'll turn again i'll have compassion on you i'll you know he'll subdue our iniquities and he will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea verse 12 of psalms 103 said as far as the east is from the west so he has removed our transgressions for from us so this is god as far as the east is from the west like as a father pity of his children he does this as a father like a father feels sorry for his children so the lord pitteth them that reverences him psalms 103 and verse 13 or verse 14 for he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are dust so he remembers he understands our humanity i said he understands our humanity that we're just human and as humans we bumble we make mistakes we do things some things we didn't want to do we get trapped we get disillusioned we have problems but he knoweth our frame and he remembers their dust they're human and there's a man as for man his days are his grass is a flower of the field so he flourishes for the wind passes over and is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more and that's our humanity we're only here for a blip in time you look out on the earth you know and a person now gone and the things that they touched the trees that they looked at the roads that you travel they're all still here that's right but they're gone you're only here for a moment every one of you have a terminal disease you're going to die say the doctor told me i'm going to die you're going to die doctor didn't have to tell you that you might be dying sooner than others but you're going to die all of us are going to come to that place unless god interrupts it [Applause] by resurrection and a rapture but otherwise we'll all go down into dust we're only here for a moment but it's what we do in that moment that counts because it's only here that you can make your decision to serve jesus christ when man is days of grass there's a flower in the field he flourishes he comes up and he blooms for a while he wilts goes down the wind passes over it blows it away the place where it was not even known anymore but not the mercies of god but the mercies of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that reverence him and his righteousness unto his children's children to keep to such as keep his covenant and those who remember his commandments to do them let's go along to jeremiah 31 34 and they shall teach no man ever understand no more teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least and to the greatest of them saith the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sins no more so not only are they casting the sea he doesn't remember them so in your fellowship and walk with him he is not reminding you of your past if you're being reminded of your past it's your adversary who is the accuser of the brethren [Applause] this mercy and forgiveness is given to us by grace now in the days of luther the church the catholic church they taught forgiveness of sins on the basis of works and this this is where the confusion is you know this is where i've come down with these scriptures but i want you to understand the people in that day didn't have a bible so they could just be told whatever the priest said and whatever edict the pope passed the bible calls her very distinctly she is a and she's got daughters in the book of revelation she's called that she's a mother horse he calls us herself the mother church she is a mother she's got daughters that's right denominations and as a horse she's one that's not true to her husband so she wasn't true to her husband in fact she changed her husband to suit herself so she made him into some kind of namby-pamby son who had to be obedient to his mother so you pray to mama to get this the son to be moved in the heart of jesus with mercy towards you and if you didn't pray to mary then you wasn't going to make it to heaven as they required you then to say so many hail marys you see when we preach about denominations and you you it's kind of like having a these offsprings of slaves that are here and they were former slaves and be honest with you at some time in our life we were all former slaves whether you're white or black the irish were slaves and enslaved and the english would get enslaved and man's done this this is sin but you know i i honestly don't remember i you know i'm part irish but i don't remember a thing i don't know a thing i never experienced a thing my forefather's experience you know you you that are are black here in this church today you don't know a thing of what they did or what they experienced you never had a slave belt on you and there's many of you sitting here you never knew what it was to be under the slave belt of denominations upon the rule of man you don't know what it meant to be beat and whipped and misled and misguided so you know when we talk about liberty you're not understanding what the liberty we had and why we enjoy that liberty and why we talk about it but we're just trying to pass it off don't ever become a slave again amen we're trying to say to our children enjoy your freedom it was paid for we fought for it amen i know white men did awful things to the black race here in america but white men also fought to liberate them in the days of luther the church the catholic church taught forgiveness of sins on the basis of work of penance for sins they required you to say numerous hail mary's asking mary to petition jesus for sin forgive sins money would be required for prayers to pay your loved ones out of purgatory you you know it wasn't enough the for to pay you know for you have to do penance and pay money and burn candles and buy candles and whatever to pay for your to say prayers for yourself that wasn't enough they made it worth it when your loved ones died you had to pay for them too the catholic encyclopedia talks in purgatory as a place or condition of temporal punishment for those who would depart in this life in god and god's grace are not entirely free from venial faults or have not fully paid the due to their transgression and to summarize in catholic theology purgatory is a place that a christian soul goes to after death to be cleansed of the sins that have not been fully satisfied during life so again you know a lot of people aren't catholics but they're still catholics they're still trying to pay for their sins and not only that they're trying to make somebody else pay for their sins and they they want them they want to make sure whoever wounded them or hurt them pays for it and they become like the servant who was forgiven of a huge amount and then found that same servant comes along and he finds somebody that just owed him pennies and he and he put him in jail had him beaten put in jail until he paid the last penny yeah and then the report comes back to to to the lord over him and he says you know you were not you you did not give forgiveness you received forgiveness i gave you great forgiveness but you won't forgive this other person i'll tell you nobody should ever want somebody to go to hell there should never be one i would never say i want to meet you in judgment someday i hope i never meet you in judgment i don't want to see nobody lost god forgave me so much i want to be able to forgive others [Applause] because as the very lord's prayer says if you cannot forgive others of their trespasses you cannot be forgiven either so do you realize when you hold somebody captive with some accusation or hurt or problem or death that they owe you they owe me a debt they should pay for this they must pay for this they owe me a debt i say god so willingly and amazingly forgave you why won't you offer that same peace and pardon [Applause] the bible said jesus said if you won't forgive others neither will the heavenly father forgive you of your trespasses say this is too simple brother tim i can't preach over your head but why do i want to speak in tongues to you and i can come right down to where you need to deal with some things some of you need to forgive things in your marriage some of your children need to forgive your parents and vice versa some of your friends need to forgive one another because you're only hurting yourself purgatory was a place where the dead souls hung over the fires of hell and you were punished till you got out until somebody paid enough money to say enough prayers to pray you out so you finally satisfied the coffers of the church i've been overseas i've been a lot of places overseas i've been to mexico city i watched them where the earthquake even took out one of their churches and cracked it up and then they had to build another and i watched women and men on their hands and knees climbing the steps saying the rosaries and i mean climbing the steps by crawling on their hands and knees and crying and praying hail mary's on every step until they finally get to the top of it trying to get forgiveness the bible said in first john chapter 2 verse 2 he is the perpetuation that means he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins yes i mean to say amen but not for ours only but for the sins of the whole world and that includes everybody even the people you don't like [Applause] hallelujah he died in our place that's what it really means he's get thrown in sacrifice he died in our place to take away our sins now luther caught a revelation of this and then the church he had been trying to do penance he said his hell marries he crawled on his knees he beat himself for his sins but one day he got to looking in the bible now the bible everybody couldn't read it luther could read latin it been translated from greek into latin so you can read it not everybody's got a copy hold your bible up for a moment this bible was paid for in blood it did not come free men died for you to have this bible respect it honor it and by all means read it and live it men were burned at the stake for the crime of publishing the bible in fact of the matter is just in china we just had some of our brothers released for passing out uh king james bibles amen in prison imprisoned incarcerated for years for the crime up sharing the bible don't take for granted your freedoms luther caught a revelation of this as i said and he looked in the bible you know he was a priest so he had access in the monastery to a bible and he read a bible and the bible said in romans 1 16 for i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also the greek for therian is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just or the righteous shall live by its faith and losing god of revelation now this is a station this is where abraham came he was he came this first place of of justification where he he was got a divine call he wasn't worthy he it wasn't that he was good it was this god called him and this is what luther realized ain't it because i've done good it wasn't because my family was better than others it wasn't because i've done all these hail marys or i crawled on my hands and knees and i beat myself and and i hung on the cross and was crucified you know they would do that kind of thing too that where they would actually be impaled and do things to to get to get retribution for their sins sins that jesus christ freely paid for once and for all now the church was charging and you couldn't ever pay enough so when you died you went to a place of purgatory to be punished more that's right you couldn't go to heaven because you're not righteous enough until your sins are paid for widows would have to sell their cows their only means of giving milk to their family they didn't have to hawk the farm they have to do everything to be able to pay for their loved ones sins they knew his mistakes but luther gets a revelation the just the righteous shall live not by my works but by my faith it's by my faith that frees me from sin that's why my words not dependence mother my health marriage not all none of that my faith and this is a foundation where the lutherans the baptists and and even we rest our faith not just losers not just baptist we rest our faith right here that we're righteous by faith not by works [Applause] the righteous live and we live because of our faith not our works so it's plain in the bible and you say brother tim you know that's so plain in the bible why was that truth lost from the church why why didn't everybody see that why did luther have to point that out as i said nobody had a bible light had never shown on that it was like a vladimir little plant that was there and these truths are in it and it comes about into the sunlight oh now it's not a wheat seed yet it's not a grain it's just a little blade and if that's where you're at you're having a ride if god's forgiven you of your sins i'm happy i rejoice we got a crop of wheat not yet so the bibles were hidden in postures in rome and written in greek translated to latin how many of you can read greek here this morning no takers well greek bible wouldn't do you much good would it how many of you can read latin well latin bible wouldn't do you much good either would it but luther could read what the pope didn't want him to read that's right and luther believed it and luther began to preach it and brother martin luther you know he was a german so he had it translated into the german language and at that very time god would use the knowledge of man and the gutenberg press was invented and now they can mass-produce the bible and now there there would be not just one bible but now there's thunder there's thousands of bibles and you know what but luther was threatened with death furthermore thousands died and were punished for believing that god forgives sins without the need of a priest that there is no intercessor between god and man but the man christ jesus that was written in the bible but they didn't have a bible so they made man their intercessor and the priest became their mediator and the priest could forgive sins when jesus is the only one who can forgive sins and only in his blood have we redemption and it's not our works but you see they persevered and like as fledgling leaf we plan to sprout out of the grain the plant began to spread its branches and there were baptists during that time they too and this is what their churches are built on when you go to baptist church it's always by faith by faith our sins are forgiven by faith you see and so the the baptist you know saw that you you were to be baptized as an adult because all of them had been baptized in the roman catholic church by being sprinkled on as a child with some holy water and they saw that they they became what's known as re-baptizers and as a re-baptizer here they come re-baptizing them now as adults when they could could call upon the lord washing away their sins when they were of age knowing that they had done wrong before because as a little child you know they hadn't done anything wrong yet as an infant and so they begin to to preach you've got to be baptized and you've got to be immersed and they saw in the bible where that they came up out of the water and where there was much water where they were baptized and all these other things and they realized that you know where if you're going to if you're going to bury a man and the old man and his sins that we're buried with him in baptism we don't sprinkle a little dirt on him you you put him down under because it takes the death and the burial and the resurrection amen now so so again this is their beliefs this is what what they took the name baptist was because they were re-baptizers and so thousands of were murdered and killed for the simple faith of being a mercy of water calling on his name now was the truth but it wasn't all the truth and finally there was enough believers until king james of england believed and had enough scholars to translate the bible carefully and now you've got the king james bible into english translated from the from the original greek see again but this man martin luther he saw the pillar of fire and the way he went just like abraham is calling god and he's led now a little deeper and and so he saw that the just shall live by faith this emboldened him to resist the church so they protested the church that's why they were that there's catholics and protestants protestants protest rome and her tyranny and so again you know they become called protestants that and he began to preach the just shall live by faith and he resisted the catholic church and he nailed his 95th theses to the door of the church there and it was in germany and he said salvationism is my faith alone the bible is the only authority and he began to preach the priesthood of every believer but it wasn't long until his followers camped down there you see it was an altar built but they camped down there and wouldn't go any further and there sets a big organization a bit you know it's kind of like when you go to the holy land today over to to israel well everywhere there was an event is a big church a board big old building hanging over you know they had one place they called it the birthplace of christ where christ was born in a two well we had to wait for an hour to get down there because there was a bunch of priests that went down in there first ahead of us mourning and chanting and crying and whatever else because this was the birthplace of jesus and they built this big shrine over it well this is what luther did he built a shrine over his revelation and so they began to they organized and god left him there i want you to understand god just left them there you see the pillar of fire moves on he don't stay in one place he's leading you into the promised land here is the land walk you in it and so here would go and then what happened god called a man by the name of john wesley and he saw it and the way he went and he had a revival then that saved england united states john wesley came here preached up and down on the up on the was going to convert the indians and he what goes back and he said i went over there to convert the enemy in the indians not the enemies the indians and he says i was not even converted who's going to convert me and there he went back and began to look at the word of god and said god there's going to be more i've got to have more than what i've got i've been forgiven i have been pardoned i have been saved from my sins but i can't live a holy life there's got to be more than that i've got to have a holy life i'm not living it lord i'm not i don't have i'm not able to live it and it went back and there he advanced further you see seed of abraham he's discovered the land because there's more than justification in the land there is sanctification so there would be wesley george whitefield and asbury many of them that had a great revival and that revival inspired new songs and as they sung their songs and deliverance charles wesley would write thousands upon thousands of songs what about the blood the cleansing power the holiness that it brings and this is where the church was brought to another junction and that junction was sanctification now remember god had told him these things and he he brings him to a place where he's going to sanctify him through the blood and i i could go a long time in that but i i'm running out of time this morning as i said i'm not going to be able to get back to it or get on to it but it just shows that the wheat plants moving back to the grain again and wesley becomes the tassel it becomes a missionary age and and there's a missionary sin out everywhere and the world gets gets uh turned on his ears so to speak and he saw the need that he saw believers were forgiven of sins but that these sinners still needed cleansing by the blood and what was missing was a holy life now he saw there was no fruit christians were forgiven of sin still living dirty lives so let's go to hebrews chapter 12 verse 14 and i'm going to close i'm going to close there we'll reach out shady i and i'll close and i'm not going to discover all that is there we'll just call that part two but he goes into hebrews chapter 12 verse 14 and and wesley sees follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man will see the lord so he began to see if we're not holy if we don't have some holiness if we don't have holy works the manifestations of this forgiveness well then we'll never see the lord so he began to preach we got to have a sanctified life now the way they got the name methodist was this the name was because john had certain methods methods of of getting holy in other words he would pray so long he would read so much in the bible he would witness so much he would do this he had different things it was methods whereby uh through works that he was doing things exhibiting and working as a christian in a christian life so you know but again he saw this revelation again without holiness no man will see the lord we've been forgiven our sin but if we want to see god we're going to have to have a holy life so in romans chapter 6 verse 22 and now being made free from sin that's justification and become servants to god that's justification you have your fruit of the holiness and the end everlasting life so he said you may have been made free from sin but you've got to have the fruit of holiness a second corinthians chapter 7 verse 1 heaven therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god so again he sees another scripture we we've got to apply the word and the grace that is given to our lives we can't just say god forgave us of our sins and we're still smoking and drinking and lusting and adultery we've got to be sanctified there's got to be an application of this word to our lives so he he would say so again and um first peter 1 15 but he that has called you is holy so be you holy in all manner of conversation now that that means manner of life and all your ways of life be holy because it's written be holy for i am holy so you see it was on these scriptures that he would build an altar and he would find a well and it would be a well of life but it wasn't the original grade it was it was the stage of the journey so again when those early methodists were sanctified i just want to cover some of this for a minute you just have to bear with me you know when the early methodists were sanctified it was an experience i said it was an experience they shouted they danced as they rejoiced some passed out others shook they were called quakers on account of it they'd get under the spirit under the waters of life and they would shake in the spirit and they lived holy lives they practiced living right living clean tobacco was gone from them alcohol going from you know adultery gun from them gone was luther and his beers you see what i'm saying i've been here here again we we've moved we've advanced and and let me tell you john wesley in his journal he defended this very emotional outburst at the second blessing this is what it was called you were blessed first like faithful abraham you were blessed at justification but here's the second blessing and the second blessing god will sanctify you and when it does it's the spirit of god kept upon you cleansing you and john wesley defended this emotional outburst that they would get this is from his journal i want you to listen to it the danger wrote wesley talking of outcries and convulsions and dancing visions and trances and the like he says the danger was to regard them too little to condemn them all together to imagine they had nothing of god in them and were a hindrance to his work whereas the truth is god suddenly and strongly convinced many that they were lost sinners the natural consequences whereof they had sudden outcries and strong bodily convulsions two to strengthen and encourage them that believe to make his work more apparent he favored several of them with divine dreams and others with trances and visions and three which i don't quite comprehend this and maybe some of you might but he said in some of these instances as a time nature mixed with grace i don't know what that means number four satan likewise mimicked this work of god that's right in order to discredit the whole work and yet it is not wise to give a part any more than to give up the hole as far as at first it was doubtless holy from god it was partly so at this day it is partly so at this day and he will enable us discern how far in every case the work is pure and where it mixes or degenerates the shadow is no disparagement of the substance nor the counterfeit of the real diamonds this is wesley's notes amen he realized yeah there's being impersonations but that don't take away from the real amen now remember i told you last uh last april of buddy robinson's conversion and he was he he again was an uh methodist i think he actually gravitated to the nazarene a little a little later they were kind of twins they were very similar beliefs like some of your pentecostals and you know will have similar beliefs with others and he said i believe that getting religion is the finest thing in the known world after a hop skipped and jumped and shouted at the midnight i would jump the mourner's bench from one side to the other all the time telling the people i'd got religion well thank the lord i'd got religion sure enough and it seemed like religion had got me after shouting until about midnight i went down to the ravine and threw my revolver away i kindled a little chunk fire and burnt my deck of cards then i crawled under an ox wagon and laid down on the bare ground and placed my hat on a chunk for a pillow i did not go to sleep for sleep and left the country i laid there and laughed like a boy at a circus i was almost tickled to death every burden gone my guilt gone all sorrows sadness gone i forgot i'd lived in poverty i thought i was dressed like the angels while my heart was turning somersaults i was laughing like a boy at a circus i was one boy that kept company with his religion the very first night that he got it i felt that night as though i would never be sick sad lonesome hungry or in trouble it seemed to me that heaven was three feet away you can't say those experiences wasn't real god met abraham at every stat at every station at every station the church has built god met up there but they built [Music] an altar there and stayed and then he was led to el shaddai and that's still the place i don't care what message theologians will tell you that's still the place we're at today because we will nurse on el shaddai till our bodies are changed and el shaddai is the baptism of the holy ghost that you need to keep nursing from let the musicians come now i have went through this very slowly very methodically very carefully trying to let you see the progress to where we're at he said brother tim we're we're up to elohim where the hearts are discerned that's true but that's just another unfolding of el shaddai and our hearts have been discerned and a message for the body change has come but we nurse on el shaddai until our bodies are changed i want more of you that's the way it's got to be wherever you are in your walk maybe you ain't even started [Music] maybe you hadn't taken the first step maybe you just took the first step you just maybe it was a baby step [Music] maybe you took the first drink from el shaddai of the revealed word coming from both testaments the unsealed book i'm just going to jump ahead just for a moment i know a lot of people thinks pentecost the zoo's a movement came to el shaddai they did [Music] but they refused the breast of the word of god and grabbed a breast of denomination that they come off of but there's a real seed that's going to nurse on the breast [Music] they're going to nurse on these promises you if you're sick today you can nurse healing if you got a need in your life you can nurse from the promises of the word of god they're open to revealed when the greatest sins are is is a sin to not progress some of you maybe accepted the lord 30 40 years ago and you never progress from there [Music] you never move you never moved into a holy life into where sin was dealt with where the cleansing fire of god comes and purges you never move you've never moved from there some of you are not advancing and it's time to advance the bombs are falling already wars are already here trouble is already in the land our nation has turned us back on god and now is not speaking as a lamb with freedom of religion but now they're demanding freedom from religion the wars that were fought in the 1700s to make this a
