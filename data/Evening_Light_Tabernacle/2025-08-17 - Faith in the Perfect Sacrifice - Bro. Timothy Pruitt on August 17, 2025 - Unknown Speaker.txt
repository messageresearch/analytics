How we thank you Lord. Yes Lord. Still free this morning to worship in spirit and in truth. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Perspective has a lot to do with life. You know from a perspective of bondage, freedom looks foreign. But from a perspective of freedom, it's awesome. And when you're free and you're living in that perspective, it changes everything. Amen. God bless you this morning. We're going to go to prayer this morning as brother Aaron Ogles be if he'd mind opening the service for us. We do want to remember several prayer requests. [Music] Want to remember Sister Crystal Kutshaw and Naa. They're both very sick. been down with the flu-l like symptoms last couple of days and just needing a real touch. Want to remember brother Tom Herring as he's out sick this morning. Sister Nancy is not able to be with us. Want to remember Bella Fields. She's very sick as well. And Sister Laura Burns's dad, Brother Bruce. We do want to remember him. He's not feeling well either. So just want to remember those that need a touch in their body. And how many would say, "Lord, pass me not. Oh gentle Savior, hear the cry of my heart. Lord, maybe it's for a loved one and whatever the need is, would you hold it before the Lord as we pray this morning?" Amen. Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just want to say this morning how much we love you, Lord. How grateful we are that we can still go free.

For while he was on the cross, I was on his mind. [Music] The look of love was on his face with thorns on his head. Wood was on that scarlet robe and it was stained crimson red. Though his eyes were on the crowd that day, he looked ahead in time. For while he was on the cross, you were on his mind. Yet he knew me. Yet he loved me. He whose glory makes the heaven shine. And I'm so unworthy of such mercy. [Music] For while he was on the cross, I was on his mind. For while he was on the cross, you were on his mind.

What a wonderful savior we have today. &gt;&gt; Let's just go to him in prayer. Father we come to you today, Lord. Just so thankful, Lord, that we can serve you and live for you in this day. Lord, we've heard the call in our lives, Lord. And we've responded to that call. Lord, what a blessed people we are today, Father. We just ask, God, you'd come and make yourself known among us today by your presence. Your love and mercy, Lord, just come and surround us. Your glory just overshadow us today. Father, you know every heart. You know every desire, every need. Lord, we just ask God you minister to these needs and these situations. Lord, encourage the discouraged. Lord, Lord, lift up those that are cast down. Father, heal those that are broken. We pray. We ask these things for your glory and for your honor in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God so good to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you today. It's good to be in the house of the Lord and &gt;&gt; just here to worship him in spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's so good to us. &gt;&gt; Has he been good to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. You can turn your in Bibles to Leviticus chapter 22 and also Hebrews chapter 10. Amen. We have uh Sister Hannah Weaten that's with us today. She's been gone for through the summer and maybe we just ought to do like brother Joe says, give her a hand clap of praise for being back. [Laughter] [Applause] Amen. I thought she done moved away there for a moment, but we're glad to have her back. So glad to have every one of you here today and most of all we're glad to have him our most welcome guest here our Lord Jesus Christ to come and and to reveal himself and to be with us today. Amen. Leviticus 22 and verse 17 says, "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, speak unto Aaron and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say unto them, whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or the strangers of is in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his free will offerings, which they will offer unto the Lord for a burnt offering. You shall offer at your own will a male without blemish of the bees or the sheep or the goats. But whatsoever hath blemish, thou shalt ye not thou shalt ye not offer, for it shall not be acceptable for you. But whosoever offerth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord to accomplish his vow or free will offering in the bees of the sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted. and there shall be no blemish therein. Also, Hebrews chapter 10 in verse one says, "For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered yearby year continually make the comers there unto perfect. For then would they not have ceased to be offered, because that the worshippers once purged should have no more conscience of sins. But in those si sacrifice, there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. Wherefore when you come, he cometh into the world, he saith, sacrifice, and offerings thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me, and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sins, thou hast no pleasure. Then said I, lo, I come in the volume of the book, it is written of me to do thy will, oh God. Above when he said, "Sacrifice and offering, and burnt offerings, and offerings for sins, thy wouldest not, neither hast pleasure therein, which are offered by the law." Then said he, "Lo, I come to do thy will, oh God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second." By that, by the will we will we are sac sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest standing daily ministering offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sin. But this man at after he had offered one sacrifice for sin forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foottool. For by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified. Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us. For after that he had said before, "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, sayaeth the Lord. I will put my law in their hearts, and in their mind will I write them, and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. Now where remission of this is, there is no more offering for sin." Amen. God bless. You can be seated today. just like to speak to you on faith in the perfect sacrifice because I I believe we have a perfect sacrifice today. &gt;&gt; As we read in the scriptures, you know, they they tried as man could do as far as providing a lamb or a beef or or a sheep or a or a goat. They would try their best to make sure that it was uh perfect and without blemish and and otherwise God would not accept it. So they would bring the most perfect lamb and the priests would look it over and examine it and and bring it bring it and go through all the different things to make sure that was perfect. But then they would lay it upon the altar. And yes, it was perfect in the outside of its appearing appearance. It maybe didn't have a blemish or spot on it, but it had a blood that could not come back upon the worshipper. And so they would offer these sacrifices time after time after time. And all of this did was it would cover the sin because as we read, amen, as Paul would begin to bring it out, he said this would only cover because there was always a remembrance of this sin that would once a year come again. And so, amen, God, this this was just a shadow of things to come. You know, as shadows are, you can you can see that it's maybe representing my hand or representing my body, but you can't see the very details of a of it in a shadow. But when the when that shadow becomes reality, then you can see what God's real intention was. And God's intention was that there be made a sacrifice that would would answer the sin question forever. Amen. It wouldn't be after one service after another service or one one camp meeting after another camp meeting or one year after another year, but it would absolutely answer the sin question forever because, you know, he he he was looking for not just a perfect sacrifice, but also a perfect people made perfect by a perfect sacrifice. And so, he had to bring a sacrifice that would pay the punishment and would pay the price. And and you know we we we can read in Matthew 5 and verse 48 he said he said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect. Now that in itself seems impossible to do. There's no way that we could ever be perfect as God is perfect. We we can't attain that on our own. So in order for him to say that he had to make a way for us to reach that perfection. Now we know our salvation, your salvation, my salvation, it does not hinge upon the merits of our own acts. You know, it hinges upon the p positive sovereign grace of almighty God. And he has chosen us in him. So, amen. That I therefore I maybe I could never be perfect and neither could you ever be perfect. We don't claim to be perfect, but we have this one consolation that our faith rests in a perfect sacrifice. Amen. that's already been received. And therefore, amen, as it was, that that sacrifice then was accepted. Then the believer was also accepted. And so it comes to our day that our lamb was also looked over. He was tried in every way. He was he was looked over by the eyes of God. And he was found to be perfect. He was found to be a perfect lamb. But the difference between this lamb, it ca he came not as a goat. He didn't come as a a sheep or he didn't come but he came on the same level at the same bloodline as we came upon. And so that blood can now be transferred over to us. Now we cannot go and have a have a trans blood transfusion from a goat or or or from a lamb or from a any other kind of creature. You know when we go get a blood transfusion is to come from human blood. And so, amen, this blood to be transfused or to be moved over into our lives, it had to come the same way. So, God created himself a blood cell. Now, I remember as a young man having a conversation with a guy, he had me a little bit confused because he asked me, you know, was Jesus Jew or was he gentile? And he goes through all of his thoughts and and you know, but I I found the answer to that when I begin to study the message that he was neither Jew nor Gentile. It wasn't that, you know, E provided the egg or or this or that, but God provided everything that it took to make himself a body. And God created the egg. He produced the the sperm that would f that would bring it to to life. He put it all together and he just placed it inside of an incubator. Amen. He placed it inside of a womb. I I found that that was possible in cattle, you know, they do it all the time. And they take an old scrub cow and they but they take an egg from a champion cow and a champion bull and they put them together and they can put them in any old scrub cow. Now when that calf is born it has no DNA whatsoever of the incubator or the carrier of its life. Amen. It comes out. It comes from who it came from. Its father and mother. Amen. And the life and the seed and all of that working together. It does not pick up one little bit of what's what's been played. what the life that has been placed on the inside. Amen. That's what he did. He made himself a blood cell. He made himself a body and he placed it there inside of an incubator. He didn't He He knew that it could not be human blood to redeem human blood. He knew that it could not be human DNA. Amen. To redeem human DNA because he knows he knew that as we do when we're born, we pick up certain genes from our mother. We pick up certain genes from our father. Amen. He didn't need genes from Joseph or this one or family traits here or family traits there. So he created himself a perfect blood cell and he placed it inside of a body that when that blood was shed at Calvary that blood paid our price. That blood paid our penalty and now we can be perfect if we accept the life of that blood. Amen. That's what it takes. The life of that blood coming upon us. And so we see here, amen, when the worshipper in the Old Testament, they had put their hands and and by faith upon the body of of that lamb, just as we do also by faith, we put our hands on the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. And we feel the terror of sin and the mock of the spit on his face. And we feel the groanings of Gethsemane and and the agonies of Calvary. And we know we're everyone guilty. Every one of us is guilty. Amen. Every one of us has come was born in sin and shaped in iniquity. Amen. We come into this world speaking lies. Amen. But see, when we felt that pull upon our life and we come to the Lord and we accepted our sacrifice and the blood came on us, Amen. then not just the blood over us and in us, but the life of that blood coming inside of us, then we can be made perfect as he was perfect. Amen. This is what he says in John 17 and verse 23. I in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one. That they may be made perfect in one. So you have to come into Christ to be made perfect. You cannot come into a church and be made perfect. You cannot be depend on being born in a certain family to be made perfect. Amen. You cannot be dependent on you know s seven generations of this or that and the other or or three generations of message believer. That's not what makes us perfect. What makes us perfect is accepting the blood that was shed for us but not just accepting the sacrifice but allowing that life to come on the inside of us and purge us from our sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is where he was there on Calvary. He says, "Then then the life that came from Calvary, which is the spirit of God, which is called the Holy Ghost, Amen, which was hid in the blood cell of the Lord Jesus, it returns to the worshipper and it baptizes and fills him with the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ. Then you are already judged." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you're already judged. You don't have to worry about judgment anymore cuz he took your judgment. He took your pain. He took your sorrow. He took your grief. Amen. So we don't have to worry about that no more. &gt;&gt; He said when I turn and I, brother said, I turn and I look maybe at a little crucifix, I realize that represents something. That represents the time he hung there on the cross in his body. And that body has already been judged. Therefore, God cannot justly judge it again. It's already judged. Uh God struck the judgment of death upon that body. And as long as I can find a way to get into that body. &gt;&gt; Come on now. It's judgment struck. Amen. That body for you and me. Therefore, we're free. That Romans 8:1 says there now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. Amen. In the body of Christ. How can I be bought? How can I come into this body of Christ? Amen. Is it because I believe a certain thing? Is it because I was raised in a certain church? It was it because I was born in a certain family? Yes and no. Amen. Not the family here upon this earth, but be born into the family of God by the power of the new birth, the blood of Jesus coming into your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what he says. So there's no condemnation. I don't care what comes and goes. You're hid beneath the blood. How many's glad to be beneath the blood? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Corinthians 12 and:e 13 says that by one spirit, how does a spirit come? Through the blood. Where did the spirit lay within the blood? Why couldn't the animal come back? It was an animal. The animal spirit cannot come to a human spirit. It cannot do anything for you. Amen. Because a human spirit is higher life than the animal. But no other man's spirit can come back. So if you got the spirit of some ancestor, Amen. that doesn't do you no good. But God himself came that his own that his own spirit which is the highest line of spirit there is can come back by the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the worshipper through the blood of Christ and take you into the body. Then you are safe. You're only safe in this body. You're only free from judgment in this body. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about Evening Light Tabernacle. I'm talking about the body of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride, &gt;&gt; the blood of bulls and goats won't work. It was too weak. Amen. So, but by by one offering, not year by year, not revival after revival, not meeting after meeting, not day after day, but one offering, he has perfected. Somebody say perfected. Perfected. Amen. By one offering forever. &gt;&gt; Forever. That's the power of his blood. &gt;&gt; It's an everlasting covenant. &gt;&gt; It ain't, you know, go out and do something wrong. Amen. Then you've lost. No. Or you you make a failure, you make a fault and you've lost it. No, it's forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. By one, by one offering, he is perfected forever. He said, "That's the answer to the death of Christ. That's the answer to Calvary. He absolutely with his own blood, he purchased our sins. He paid for our sins and he has perfected forever his believers. Therefore, in Christ, we stand blameless. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You stand blameless this morning. It doesn't matter what you've done. You can have a wrap sheet all the way from here to the ceiling that Satan's kept up with you on your life. But if you've asked for forgiveness, it's all forgiveness. You stand blameless. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blameless. Amen. Perfected in the presence of God Almighty. Oh my, ain't that amazing? Not just perfect in somebody else's sight, &gt;&gt; but perfect in God's sight. &gt;&gt; That's what we need to strive for. You know, too many people get caught up in being perfect in social media site or perfect in have this perfect life or this perfect lifestyle or this perfect thing. Amen. And we put it out there because we want somebody else to think, "Wow, he's got a perfect life. He's got a perfect way. He's got a perfect body. He's got a perfect this." Amen. It ain't about being perfect in somebody else's sight. &gt;&gt; It's about being perfect in God's sight. &gt;&gt; This is where the devil gets people tricked up and tripped up because he got our minds and the world's all about being perfect in in somebody else's sight. &gt;&gt; You know, we got to have perfect hair and we got to have perfect lips and we got to have per Lord help us got to be perfect everything. But you stand blameless. &gt;&gt; You stand blameless. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? Standing blameless in God's sight. That's that's some rejoicing stuff right there. &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "Be ye therefore perfect. It is perfected forever." God through the death of Christ 2,000 years ago perfected the believer for he for he foresaw before the foundation of the world forever. Those he called he has justified. Those he forneew he called. Those he called he justified. Those he justified he has also glorified. Or in other words he has perfected his believers. Amen. But the law having a shadow of good things to come. Not the very image of those things but a shadow of something to come. Amen. So by year by year it was trying. that was working. They was trying to become perfect. Amen. But see, but for then they you said if they they could have received that if they could have received that perfection, they would have ceased from offering. But they could not re reach that because they would come in with that that that desire in their heart that that that that that want to do wrong and they would offer sacrifice and they would go back and they would still have that same old desire. Because this is what brother Brandham deals with. He deals with no more conscience for sin. He said actually that should that word should be amen translated or the real interpretation is desire because you always as far as you know what we think of conscious you should always be conscious of sin. &gt;&gt; That sin is sin. That's why being conscious of it. Amen. But this is no more desire for sin. No more desire because Christ has come and taken that away by his power of his word and his spirit. The Holy Ghost comes into your heart. The very sin question is settled forever. Every desire for sin has been taken away. For the law could have done that then sacrifices would have ceased. But it could not. So Christ had to come and die so we could be made perfect like he is perfect. &gt;&gt; But there's so many things about perfection. And you know, we're always trying, you know, to reach that moment and reach that place. But it's only God's grace that we are what we are. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's only God's grace. &gt;&gt; When I think about God's grace, it's only God's grace that we have the have the even the desire to serve him &gt;&gt; because there's so many out here that has no desire whatsoever. It's only God's grace that you heard a felt a little pull or you help a heard a call or or something was said and it sparked something on the inside. It's only by God's grace. We're not here because we're something great or we made ourselves something. We have made we can't make oursel anything if we wanted to. Cuz if we could have, they would have a long time ago when they was offering sacrifices after sacrifices. They were trying on their own. They were trying on their own abilities to raise the best, to do the best, but it would never produce the life needed. &gt;&gt; And so when we look at others, we need to remember the grace God's given us &gt;&gt; because it's very easy, you know, in in the world that we live in because it's getting very dark and it's very very very evil and it's the evil is coming out of people. every day you see it more and more. And then and then and then we also even even ought to be real careful with the our the grace that we give and the and the things we look to and and make sure that our eyes can can see like he sees. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, we need to see sin and not go that way. But when we see somebody in sin, we not ought to be saying looking at that and saying not not the sin but God be merciful on the sinner. &gt;&gt; Amen. God hates the sin, but he loves the sinner. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if it's somebody that's left this church, we ought to be very careful how we look at that and how we how we even deem it and what we even say about it. Because listen, it's only by the grace of God that you're still sitting here this morning. &gt;&gt; It's only by God's grace that we haven't walked away, throw down our our life to the world, and just said, "Forget all about it." Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham looked at this and he said, "I learned the lesson in this grace and God's blood and the power." He said, he said, "I I learned a lesson the hard way." He says, and we know the story of him being in a meeting in Ohio, but give me a moment. I'm going to go through it because it's very powerful. And he said, "I was staying out in the country." He said, "Because of all the masses of people and things." And so, but we had a little we've been eating at this little Dunkered restaurant. They called caught it and he said had such a lovely little waitresses and decently dressed and clean and very ladylike waited on us and said little spot of heaven to eat in such a place and the kitchen was and span and on Sunday they closed up and they went to their church and so I got a little hungry and I thought I'd go somewhere else you know and and so he goes to another place little common little American restaurant that he didn't name it but to get something to eat and he said I walked in the door and I hear a slot machine going man of my age probably a married man with his arms around a woman playing a slot machine, a policeman of our very law to protect our righteous and our goods, standing there violating the very thing he's supposed to be protecting because it was illegal to gamble in Ohio playing a slot machine. I turned and looked the back of the building, a bunch of teenage boys and a bunch of rock and roll records on the machine playing. A young lady about 18 years old here neatly under her anatomy as a woman as you get kind of catch the drift. But she was standing there with her dress hanging low in the front. One of these boys with his hands on the girl and where it didn't belong and they was smoking and drinking. I thought, "Oh, God, how can you stand it?" &gt;&gt; And I looked over to my right and I heard someone make a big groan. And this little this set this age woman probably 60, maybe 70 years old, little old vulgar clothes about halfway up her limbs and her poor old wrinkled flesh just as flabby as it could be. And she had up there lip makeup and big purple thing on the side of her face painted up. Little pair of shoes, purple tan, toenails, purple f. I think he probably was studying her painted and her hair her hair was cut real short and curled up and dyed blue. Wow. This is in the 60s. And AC and across the the table said two men drunk. One of them, you know, with a big old army coat and a gray scarf wrapped around his neck and whiskers all over his face, belching and going all excused himself from her and walked started to walk like this to the restroom and and I stood there and said, "God, why don't you destroy the whole thing? Why don't you just sink it beneath the earth? Is my little Sarah and Rebecca going to have to grow up under stuff like this? How can you, God, in your great holiness ever stand to look at such a thing like that and not send an earthquake and sink it? He done it before. &gt;&gt; He sunk a whole group of people. &gt;&gt; But you got to remember that was under the blood of bulls and goats. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I was standing there condemning the woman and and as I was I stepped back behind the door and I felt the spirit of God come to me and I stepped back behind the door and I seen something whirling. And in a vision it was the world turning around and around. And as I noticed around the world was a scarlet streak around it. And I got to the world. I seen myself just a little boy doing things I ought not do. Amen. Maybe maybe not like that, but it was still sin. And every time I did anything, I seen a great big shadow go towards heaven. God should have killed me at that moment. &gt;&gt; But then I seen standing between me and God stood that perfect sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Stood that perfect sacrifice. And I seen him standing there with the thorns on his head and the spit hanging on his face. And every time my sins would start towards God, he would reach out and catch it. Oh God, he would reach out and catch it like a bumper on the car. He was protecting me from the death I should have had. &gt;&gt; Every time I do anything wrong, God should have killed me. Certainly. His holiness required it. His laws required it. Every time I do anything or you do anything, the blood of Jesus Christ acts like a bumper. I seen that scarlet streak meant that the blood still holds the earth. &gt;&gt; The blood still holds the earth. And as I stood looking, I got a little closer to him. As I noticed him, I could hear him say, "Father, forgive him. He just don't know what he's doing. Father, forgive him. He don't know what he's doing." But I looked down, there laid a book, and there was a recording angel writing it all down and my name on it. And I realized that same day that blood streak would have been lifted. I'd have to stand in the presence of God and my sinful self. I seen by his mercy, he was holding off my judgment. He was holding off my judgment. And I went to him humbly. I knelt to my knees. I said, "Oh Jesus, thou son of God, am I I'm unworthy to come into your presence, but will you forgive me for what I've done?" And he touched the in his side and he grabbed some blood and he wrote over that old book, "Pardon." &gt;&gt; And he looked at me very sternly, says, "Now I've forgiven you, but you want to condemn her. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Come on. We We see a lot of folks like these. He's describing even worse. &gt;&gt; Then what is wrong with them crazy people? God, what in the world? Why have you allowed? But God don't see it. &gt;&gt; He sees a blood. Now, one of these days, this blood's going to lift &gt;&gt; and then there's going to be sinkings and all kinds of things take place and tribulations and all kind of stuff. But right now, we have this blood and it's so perfect that God doesn't see an old woman flabby, dressed unmorally. Amen. Blue hair, blue, all kind of makeup on. And we want to condemn somebody because they made a mistake. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. We're talking about a perfect sacrifice here. Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to condemn somebody because they left for a for a little while. Hey, listen. There's got to be fulfillments in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Whether you want the only way there could be a fulfillment of the prodal son, there has to be prodal sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. God allows things to happen and people to get and they people look at the wrong things and they get discouraged and they say, "Well, I just go out there." But sooner or later, they're going to realize, hey, there's better things in my father's house. &gt;&gt; And I I'm I'm sorry, but sometimes I wonder if we're going to look at them with the right kind of eyes. &gt;&gt; Are we going to look with them through judgments and what they've done and the mistakes? Amen. Are we going to be like the 11th hour workers that were mad because some are the last workers that were so mad because the ones that came in the end got paid the same as everybody else? Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Amen. We got to realize there's a grace here. There's a mercy here. I needed his grace and I want it for everybody else. &gt;&gt; I needed his forgiveness and I wanted it for everybody else. &gt;&gt; He wrote, "Pardon on me." I want him to write it on somebody else. So when I come into the vision, come out of the vision, I walked over to her and I said, "How do you do?" Apparently his attitude's changed now. He didn't come up to her like he wanted, "You lousy sorry sinner. What's wrong with you? How do you do?" She said, "Oh, hello." Said, "Could I sit down?" She said, "I already have company." He said, 'I don't mean it that way, lady. I just want to speak to you a minute. She said, 'Well, be seated. I said, 'Lady, just a few minutes ago standing over there behind that door and I began to tell her all that took place, how that he was condemning her and how he was telling God he ought to strike it off and how he saw the blood and he said, I begin to look and tears begin to run down that cheek. I said, 'Lady, you don't mean to do these things, but I'm here to tell you Jesus died for you, and the judgments of God is held off by this blood.' She said, 'N no, sir. I don't I don't want to I don't want to be this way. He said, "My father was raised was a deacon in the church. I was raised in a Christian home. My husband and I were charter members, lived a Christian life, and she began to tell me after his death, she had two had two young girls, and she just went astray and how the girls had left her, and she'd throw her life away." She just thought now there wasn't no more hope for her. And I said, "God be merciful. Those who he has fornown, he is also called." She looked at him and said, "Are you Reverend Brandham?" I said, "I am." She said, "I'm ashamed of myself to be sitting here like this, but let me ask you this. Do you think there's a chance for me?" Not five minutes ago. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Not in his not in his mind, but he all but he caught a vision of a perfect sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "Hey," he said, "Yes, there's a chance for you." I said, "Jesus has his armstretched wide waiting for you to come, lady." I said, "Would you walk out here on this floor with me?" She said, "Yes, sir, I will." And I took her by the hand. I said, "You're about the age of my mother. would you kneel down on the floor? And there in the floor, we broke that place up that afternoon and had an oldfashioned Holy Ghost meeting. And God saved that woman by grace. She dressed herself up right, came to the meeting, and as far as I know, she's living a Christian life tonight. &gt;&gt; But what what changed his attitude towards a perfect sacrifice? that he realized there's enough blood for me and if God's got enough blood for me and my sin &gt;&gt; cuz at first you know there's other times he tells it he said he saw those sins going up and he asked this question is that the sins of the world he said no that's your sins &gt;&gt; and he realized God's got blood for me and if God's got blood for me he's got blood for you and he's got blood for you he's got blood for every one of us &gt;&gt; by one sacrifice Not a million lambs, not a thousand lambs, but by one sacrifice, &gt;&gt; he's got enough blood. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; What is it? God requires perfection. He requires your repentance. He requires your loyalty to him. He He's looking for it. No matter how much you sin, how little or how much. No matter how much you sin, how little, or how much, you're still a sinner and cannot get in no other way but by Jesus Christ, God's allsufficient sacrifice. And in him, you are perfect. Perfected forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think of it. It's not nothing to do with you. &gt;&gt; Right? If it's something to do with us and we ain't if we think we really think that in our hearts, we ain't no better than the Pharisees. That's what we are. Message Pharisee. &gt;&gt; Ain't got nothing to do with us. It's not new pages you turn, isn't it? But it's not it's it's a new life. It's a confession that you're wrong. And you accept God's grace. But not only accept God's grace, you accept his life. And you that brings you into perfection. Then you are perfected in Jesus Christ. And this is where he says in Romans 8 and verse one, there is therefore now no condemnation. &gt;&gt; Somebody say that no condemnation. &gt;&gt; No condemnation to him which are in Christ Jesus &gt;&gt; which walk after not after the flesh but after the spirit. Now I want to break into a little something here on condemnation versus conviction because there is a difference. People get these mixed up. Condemnation refers to an act of declaring someone guilty and subject to punishment. But biblical conviction is actually what they what is known or said, Paul talked about it, godly sorrow. It actually yes, I'm guilty, but there's an answer for my guilt. &gt;&gt; And if I accept this answer for my guilt, then I am not condemned. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on, somebody. Amen. It's just like somebody going to a judge. You can be convicted or you can even be condemned. Now, convicted, yeah, you may have to pay a price. There may be a spot of, you know, probation or a few years. Amen. But if you're condemned, actually, the word condemned, you look real deep in it. It means a separation. It talks about an eternal separation from God. It's a death penalty. And listen, a death penalty does not come from God. Not when the blood's still around. &gt;&gt; He He's already paid the death penalty. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, when this blood leaves, yes, there going to be death penalties because they rejected the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; But listen, he said in John 3 and verse 17, "For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world." Well, I you know I could understand that if he said God sent not his world son into the world to condemn the Christians. No, he said to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved. And he that believeth on him is not condemned. &gt;&gt; Is not condemned. But he that believeth not is all condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God. And this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world, but men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. See, condemnation comes from Satan, and it's meant to tear you down. Condemnation continually points out what a failure you are. &gt;&gt; It continually is showing you that, you know, that that you've messed up and it's showing you the problem, but it's never taking you to the solution. &gt;&gt; All right? Amen. Conviction, as we said, is known in the Bible as godly sorrow. God's word tells us that godly sorrow is what leads us to repentance. &gt;&gt; Condemnation tells you you're such a failure. Look at what you did. Why conviction says, "Come to me and I will forgive you." &gt;&gt; Condemnation is always trying to make you pay for what you did. instead of conviction is actually bringing to a place to accept that he's already paid for what you did. Condemnation shouts to you constantly your past, your sins, your losers. But conviction shouts, "The blood of Jesus washes away all your sin. Come to Jesus and be forgiven of your sin. You can be forgiven. Your sin and your past don't have to be a part of you anymore." &gt;&gt; Amen. Conviction actually focuses on specific actions and offers a way of changing it. While condemnation only focuses on your personal worthlessness. Oh man, we got we got we done got quiet. Convictions awfully involve as we said godly sorrow while condemnation involves a sense of shame and despair. So you know conviction comes from God. We know but condemnation comes from the enemy. Conviction leads to repentance and restoration while condemnation leads to discouragement and hopelessness. &gt;&gt; Found this little graph that I thought was pretty good. is talk conviction by the spirit and condemnation by the enemy. Conviction actually is true guilt. Condemnation is false guilt. True conviction is leads to contrition or sorry that you sin. Condemnation leads to feeling worthlessness or inept a sorry sinner. You catch that. Sorry for there's a big difference there. sorry for your sin or a sorry sinner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the devil is constantly trying to put over on you is you're nothing but a sorry sinner. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz you made a mistake. You made you made issues. You you if you fell down one time. Listen, it's not by our own merits and our own abilities. It's by the power of God that we can stay upright walking in faith in him. It's by the blood of Jesus that we can rise above the filth of this old world and the filth of this old thing that we live in and the and the and the flesh that we war against. It's by the power and the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Conviction actually targets your sin. Condemnation actually attacks you. &gt;&gt; Conviction actually explains. Condemnation accuses. Conviction actually illuminates our path to freedom. Condemnation darkens our understanding to the point that we don't even believe we're sons of God anymore. &gt;&gt; Because truly, if you'd be a son of God, you'd have never done nothing like that, right? It actually conviction actually It brings a specific wrong and it brings it to a clarified state. Amen. Condemnation is a fog of general wrongness and you're just wrong about everything. Conviction brings repentance. Condemnation spreads confusion. Conviction feels light and right. Condemnation feels heavy and wrong. Conviction may not want you may not want to repent, but you conviction you you you you want to repent and agree with the truth. Condemnation, you may be willing to confess to anything, but you'll never get freedom from it. &gt;&gt; But God did not send his son to condemn you. &gt;&gt; He sent his son to convict you and say, "I'm a sinner. I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; But there is a way that I can be free from these things. Conviction shows you the answer which is the blood of Jesus and it washes away every sin. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It washes away every sin. While condemnation shows you the problem, the sin, the past, the failures. Condemn condemnation shows you the problem but conviction shows you the answer. And the answer is a perfect blood. &gt;&gt; This is why sometimes young people can't get the victory because the devil's got condemnation on their life when they've already asked for forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Because listen, when you ask for forgiveness, let's read it here in Revelation 15. Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood. The word washed is actually loosed. It's loosed. has loosed us from our sins in his own blood. Amen. Say, "Isn't that wonderful?" He said, "Did you catch it?" It was his own blood that loosed us completely. &gt;&gt; Not partially, &gt;&gt; not just a partway loosing, not just a halfway, but completely loosed us from our sin. Amen. It was not human blood. It was the blood of God. Peter called it the blood of Christ. Paul called it the blood of the Lord and the blood of Jesus. Not three person, but one person. There's a revelation again. One God, that omnipotent Jehovah God came down, made himself a body by means of the virgin birth, and indwelt it, that it might be the blood of God that would free us, loose us entirely from our sins, and present us spotless before himself with exceedingly great joy. &gt;&gt; That he might present us spotless. &gt;&gt; I got a lot of spots. Well, you got a spotless sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. that he might present us spotless. &gt;&gt; That he might pre present us spotless. It's not me making sure I got everything crossed. Listen, Pharisees had that done. They would do the right times and the right prayers and the right this and the right that. Wouldn't touch this, wouldn't touch that, would stone somebody for doing it. Had it all figured out. But that wasn't the rest that Jesus wanted. That wasn't the blood Jesus really wanted or God required. It was the blood of a perfect sacrifice that he that sacrifice can present us spotless. Amen. He said, see, you can see it in the Old Testament type. Let us go back to the Garden of Eden. The first news came from glory that the son Adam had been lost. Did God send an angel? Did he send a son? Did he send an unlike? No. No. He came himself to redeem that lost son. God did not entrust his plan of salvation to another. He trusted only himself. God was made flesh and dwelt among us and redeemed us unto himself and were saved by the blood of God. The eternal God and dwelt a mortal body in order to take away sin. He became the lamb in order to shed his blood and enter into the veil with it. Consider this. Since it was the blood of God, it is a perfect blood. And if it's a perfect blood that has loosed us from power and bondage and defilement of sin, then the loosen is perfect and complete. There is now therefore no condemnation. &gt;&gt; Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect. &gt;&gt; Well, if somebody's laying something to your charge, I can tell you who it is. It's Satan. &gt;&gt; Cuz once that sin has been dipped under the blood of Jesus Christ, it's remembered no more. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I got a lot dipped down in there. &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful I ain't got to go before him every day and wonder if he still remembers when I did this wrong and when it still remembers what I know. I can boldly go before the throne of grace cuz I'm not coming in on my own merits or my own abilities. He is presenting me spotless. Who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect? Well, I can tell you, you know, you did this wrong and you did that and condemnation, condemnation, condemn this, condemn that. That's the devil. &gt;&gt; Quit listening to his voice. &gt;&gt; Now, it's from God and you did wrong and it convicts your heart. Make it right. Just like brother Brandham talked about that woman, you know, I think brother John Andy's did a little demonstration in our camp about that woman that was standing in line. I think it was a woman, right? Anyway, had something going on in her life and he said, "If you've done such and such and such, he said, "Step back out. Step out of the line. Make it right. Ask God to forgive you. Step back in the line." &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Come on, young person. If you done something wrong, step out of the line, make it right before God, get back in line. &gt;&gt; It ain't no coming service after service and crying out to God for hours and hour. No, make it right &gt;&gt; and say, "God, I was wrong." That's what conviction is. It brings you to a place that you can ask God for repentance and you can make things right. Condemnation just hangs it over your head. &gt;&gt; The devil's constant, oh, he remembers. He got a big list. He's constantly trying to bring it up and constantly trying to That is not God talking to you cuz God doesn't even remember it no more. &gt;&gt; He's not the one coming to you when you try to raise your hands and say, "Well, you remember last week or last month or when you used to do this or used to do you remember haha you that's condemnation. That is the voice of the devil." &gt;&gt; But if you have done wrong and God speaks to your heart, he'll show it to you, make it clear so you can make it right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And once it's right, it's over. &gt;&gt; Step out of the line, make it right, get back in line. &gt;&gt; But condemnation wants you to step out of the line and stay out of the line. &gt;&gt; Come on. It wants you to step out and you stay out and you get away from fellowship. And you get away from this. Why? Because you're never worthy to come around them people. Listen, we ain't none of us worthy to be here. There you go. &gt;&gt; There's not one person sitting in a seat this morning or standing here on this platform or sitting there that is worthy to be here this morning. I'm not here because I'm worthy. I'm here because he's worthy. &gt;&gt; I don't believe what I believe cuz I'm worthy. I believe it cuz he's worthy. His death gave us the blood and that blood has loosed us. There is now no condemnation. What kind of service could we have if there was no condemnation? If there wasn't that little thought that wanted to come and Satan implant something in your mind just a moment you're about to have a breakthrough. What if that wasn't there? I'll tell you what would be. You'd go ahead and have your breakthrough. &gt;&gt; What if that wasn't there every time you went to lift your hands or you went to praise God? Listen, I tell you what would happen. You would go ahead lift your hands. You go ahead and praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can realize and get a real clear picture of where that stuff is coming from, you'll cast down that condemnation and say, "That's not me. I didn't ask God to forgive me. It's already done. It's finished. It's over with. I'll raise my hands. I'll praise God. I'll glorify him anyway cuz I have a perfect sacrifice. And I have faith in it &gt;&gt; that in if I do make a mistake, there's still a blood. I can understand you not having faith in the blood of bulls and goats anymore. I can understand you having faith and not having faith and if it was my blood or somebody else in here in blood that you're trying to apply. I can understand that. We're not talking about any of that. We're talking about a perfect blood. He saw Adam and Eve as they would leave the garden cast aways. Could you imagine the condemnation they had? All the things they done wrong. Brother just reading over it before I come out. Brother Ram says Eve begin to feel that arthritis. She be getting to feel those pains. She begin to say, "Adam, what have I done? What have I done? Adam says, "Eve, what have I done?" And he said, "God was watching Adam go out." He said, "Because Adam didn't have to. He was not deceived. He willingly took her to himself because he knew if he took her to himself, he would save her or God would have to strike him, too." And God saw that and he said something sparked in the heart of God. &gt;&gt; He said, "Thy seed." And he begins to talk about the immity. I'll put an immity between thy seed and the serpent's seed. You won't always have to live this way. &gt;&gt; They used to have to live that way in the Old Testament because it was under the blood of go bulls and goats. Satan had a right to bring his condemnation because they would go in with a lust spirit and come out with a lust spirit. They would go in with situations in their life and come right out with it. They had a covering, but they didn't have something that would annihilate it. But now, as he said, I'll put him in. He said, I can just say, switch the scene for a moment. He said, I see him crying out for his life. I see him screaming for him to be crucified. And I watch him walking up that old hill called Goltha. And I see a white robe. He start getting bright red spots in it. He said, "Before long, it's all red." And he said, "I see him nail him to the cross. I see him put him up there and push the push the pole up and sink it in the ground. I see him cry out, "God, why hast thou forsaken me?" He said, "But I see him say, it is finished." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. If you do a study, I was actually looking to preach on it, but I hadn't got there yet. But if you do a study on it is finished. It's a word that means actually three things. All the sin debt is paid. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All the sin da debt is paid. All the debt, all the debt that you ever owed is done away with. Amen. All your healing and deliverance is done. Amen. Not only that, he's also finished the back of Satan. He's crushed him under his feet. Amen. Listen, that that devil that's wanting to hang over you and put all kind of nonsense on your head, he is a defeated devil. Listen, he that that condemnation that he's putting on you is actually his condemnation. It's what's going to condemn him and put him into hell. Amen. What brother say about that? He said when you ask God to forgive you, all of that sin is rolled off of your back and is transferred onto your accuser. And he said, "He will go to hell for your sins." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is what it was. He said, "It's finished. No longer will my children have to be under condemnation, but they can live above it." &gt;&gt; His death gave us the blood. We're loosed. We're free. We're guiltless. Now, you got an old book. Yes, there's an old book. But you do do you know that old book? I love how brother Wayne brought it out one time at camp about our list. I've got a list of every sin you ever done, every white website you ever looked at, every thing you've ever said wrong, every time you've ever wronged somebody, just goes down this whole big list. And he stops and he says, "But something happened to the records. &gt;&gt; It got wiped out. &gt;&gt; I had an old book, but something happened to it. It got wiped out. &gt;&gt; That blood went across it and just rode across all those sins. And now all you can see is blood. &gt;&gt; It's in the sea of forgetfulness. So you can stand perfect before God. &gt;&gt; Your name is now in a new book. Not the book of life, but the lamb's book of life. What the lamb redeemed. Not the old book of your natural union, but your new book. A new bride. Hallelujah. your new life in the lamb's book of life, your marriage certificate where your true eternal gene or germ from the beginning takes hold. So you're not only forgiven, you're justified. Look up that word. That word doesn't mean forgiven. It means justified. When he talk about the just shall live by faith, it means justified. If you hear, I got drunk and done some evil things. Then you'd come around say things and you found I did them. But then what if you found out I really didn't do them? You still say I forgive you. Forgive me for what? I didn't do it in the first place. If I did, I'm guilty. But you can forgive me. But I wasn't even guilty because I'm not because I'm justified. &gt;&gt; It's not even regarded at all. God's book is in the sea of forgetfulness. Your old book and marriage is divorced, dead, and it's not even in the memories of God. You were justified. You never done it in the first place. It's forgiven. It's finished. It's over with. Amen. &gt;&gt; My, if we can get that this morning, that our sins which were many, we've been made white as snow. &gt;&gt; God doesn't even remember it no more. What a wonderful savior. Oh yeah. Well, the accuser may come. He can accuse whatever he wants to, but what good is it to accuse if there's nothing to be accused of, &gt;&gt; right? You were deceived into this place. He said, "You were deceived by the parents." I talking to a young man yesterday and he's has a lot of bitterness in his heart towards God and things. I just talking to him just said, "Look, don't don't get there. Don't let it turn it towards a real enemy." &gt;&gt; You might might got a right to have bitterness in your heart, but turn it towards a real enemy. &gt;&gt; God's not your enemy. &gt;&gt; And I begin to talk to him about how that that they were sold into this life by Adam and Eve at the fall. But I said, God made a way and he's made a way back to that Eden again. Back to that place, back to that place that we ain't under that old covenant no more. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brham brings this story about the little mule out in the pasture. He says, "I don't know whether you ever farmed in here or not, but this mule been born with some floppy ears. About the most horrible mule you ever seen. Knock need crosseyed tail stick straight up horrible looking mule. Well, I ain't never seen a good-looking mule, but this this apparently bad. He look around his m say, "You know what? As soon as the master of the house comes out, he going to knock me in the head. I'm not even worth the food I eat. I'm no good." That sounds like a lot of message mules. &gt;&gt; Follow me in the type now. I ain't saying you can't be saved. &gt;&gt; All right. But if his mammy was really instructed, she'd say, "Wait a minute, son. I got to tell you something. Maybe you don't know. &gt;&gt; You've been born under a birthright. When the master of the house, I don't care what you look like, comes out to see, you got a newborn mule. Then the thing he has to do is get a lamb without blemish and take a perfect lamb and it has to die so you can live." He said, 'The moment that that land, that mule hears that, he got a right to kick up his heels and have a big time. &gt;&gt; He said, 'Th that's the way it is within us. We're imperfect, no good, born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come to this world speaking lie. We were no good to begin with. But God doesn't even look at you. &gt;&gt; He doesn't even look at you. He looks at the sacrifice. He looks at the lamb. He doesn't even see you. He sees Christ. &gt;&gt; That's why no condemnation. &gt;&gt; Now, hey, like I said, when this sacrifice moves back and this blood pulls away from this earth, when the bride leaves, &gt;&gt; there going to be a lot of condemnation &gt;&gt; there. There going to be a lot of condemning. God's going to condemn this whole world to fire. But until then, he sees the lamb. When you come into church, he sees the lamb. When you're at work, he sees the lamb. Now, of course, we don't do as Paul, you know, Paul said, "Do we sin even the more that grace may abound?" No, that's not. You don't got the life of that lamb yet, if that's the case. But if you make a fault, he sees the lamb. &gt;&gt; If you have a failure in your life, he sees the lamb. He said, "God called you by grace, not that you would, but God would." The scripture said he was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world. That's God's word. When God speaks is as good as finished, right then. So, how you going to stamp out the baptism of the Holy Spirit? How you going to stamp out the gifts? How you going to stamp it out of the church? You can't do it. God spoke, it's going to be that's settled. It certainly it'll materialize somewhere. And when God foresaw by his fornowledge how he would redeem this world of sin and corruption, he slayed Christ before the foundation of the world. Amen. The book of uh of Revelation said when the Antichrist comes upon the earth, he will deceive all whose names are not written on the lamb's book of life. From the foundation of the world by God. So God by his fornowledge knew you and he called you to Christ and he put your name on the lamb's book of life. What do we got to be scared about? Are you afraid to take his word for anything? Don't be afraid. He is here and you are heir to everything that he has. &gt;&gt; You are righteous because he is righteous. You are perfect because he is perfect. &gt;&gt; He paid it all. I tell you what, people come into a church and all they see is faults, they're they're looking at the wrong thing. Because if you're looking at Christ, you don't see any faults. &gt;&gt; Balam, what did he do? He came and he looked on the back side of of Israel. They're backside as the scripture said, meaning they're hinder parts. We all got them. Every one of us. We fight this human flesh every day. &gt;&gt; And I get amused by people say, "Well, I ain't going to go to church. There's just so many, you know, so many hypocrites there." I tell you, hypocrites. Well, why ain't that stopped you from going to Walmart or anywhere else? There's hypocrites everywhere. We don't come to church to see what fault we can find or see what issue we can see. We come to see Jesus. &gt;&gt; Sir, we would see Jesus. And brother talks about Bam. He said if he would have really looked, he'd have saw the pillar of fire that was in the camp. He and they had problems and said, "Yeah, but the pillar of fire was in the camp and the shadow of the king was in the camp." &gt;&gt; It all depends on what you're looking at or who you're looking at whether you will see faults or not. &gt;&gt; Cuz listen, let me tell you, if you want to find faults, you're going to find them. I just I think if I was somebody that always found faults, I'll just say, "God, forgive me for my unbelief. Forgive me for the way I look at things and help me look the way you see things." &gt;&gt; Talking to brother the other day, a pastor, and he said, you know, and and it's and it's the same no matter who you talk to. He said there's two, and I don't even mean to get on this, but we're here, so anyway, forgive me. Whatever. Said there's two things that people find fault in the church the most, and that's the AC and the music. It ain't just our churches, every church. It can't be cold enough for some people, can't be hot enough for some people, can't be loud enough for some people, can't be soft enough for some people, can't be this, can't be. We're humans. We all got preferences. How many likes Dr. Pepper the best? Few hands. How many likes Coke the best? How many likes Pepsi the best? God help you. We all They just got here. Oklahoma thing, I guess. God bless you anyhow. We love you. &gt;&gt; But we all got preferences. That's right. &gt;&gt; Every one of us got preferences. Every one of us got things we like, things we don't like. Some things matter to us more than other things matter to us. And somebody else, that thing matters them way more than ever matters to me. But we all but don't What we got to make sure of is we don't make our preferences spiritual. &gt;&gt; What's spiritual is the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; What's spiritual is what God sees, not what we see. What what's spiritual is what pleases him, not what pleases me. &gt;&gt; But that this old mule, all he could see is no need. All he could see was his faults. All he could see was his failures. All he could see that he was about to die. He was condemned. But the master didn't see him. He saw a lamb. Sometimes I feel like that's how it is. And some of our young people, you know, they're coming through those stages of life. They get in those things, those stages and moments of their life. They're so unsure about this and this that and the other. Things are happening. All kind of things are happening in their body, outside the body, in their mind, outside. All kinds of things are going on. And they get so unstable during those moments and all they can see is their faults and all they can see is their mistakes. Well, I don't have this and I don't I I don't I need this and I need that. Quit looking to that. Look at your lamb. Look what God has done for you. Look where God in his grace has even placed you in a in a family in a in a home of believers or or in a church of believer. Look what God has already done for you. &gt;&gt; He didn't start this work to just say, you know what, forget it. He's too knocked. I can't do nothing. No, he's got a lamb for that. &gt;&gt; He's too far gone. No, he's got a lamb for that. &gt;&gt; And it's a perfect lamb. &gt;&gt; If you can find fault in him, then you ain't got no hope. But I'm here to tell you, he is a perfect lamb. &gt;&gt; And you can have faith in this perfect lamb. You can have faith in him when you can't have faith in nothing else &gt;&gt; cuz things will go on, things will happen, things will go wrong, things will turn upside down and backwards and everything gets turvy. But you can have faith that this lamb paid a price. This lamb, he came down so he could break out that body. Think about what he did on Calvary. They tore that flesh. They spit on him and the crown made fun of him. You know why he took all that? So you don't have to. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if somebody makes fun of you. It only matters what God says. It doesn't matter if somebody may spit on you, spit on your name. It only matters what God says. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if people want to tear flesh from you and it hurts. It matters what God sees. If we can come to that place in our life and and that place in our church and that place around other people that we're not looking and trying to find every little fault. God, if I'm I'd say, God, if I'm a negative type of person, forgive me. Let me see positive things. Let me look at what's right instead of what's wrong. Let me see what you're really doing among us instead of what's not happening. &gt;&gt; Let me see the pillar of fire. Let me let me see the blood that's running around this church. Let me see the angels of God that are encamping about us. Let me see those things. Don't let me look at the faults and the failures and the mistakes and this that and the other. Let me see you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me see him. He's the perfect sacrifice. If you can find fault in him, he said, "Well, I'll tell you why you can't be healed. But when you can find no fault in your sacrifice, then God can do anything for you. &gt;&gt; He can heal you. He can deliver you. He can set you free." You say, "Oh, I feel religious about right now because I'd know I'd never had a chance to begin with." Well, if I had just been born in a better home. Let me tell you, the prophet wasn't born in the best home either. &gt;&gt; His father was a drunkard, poor. It wasn't the greatest upcoming raising a person could ever have. It was looked down. It was scoured upon. They were looked down upon in the community, but God wasn't looking at that. God was looking through his blood. So, I mean, you may not have everything in this world. You may not have all the riches of this life. You may not have houses and lands and this that and the other, but as long as I've got Jesus, &gt;&gt; I've got everything. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As long as I have him, as long as he knows me and I know him and I can see what he's done for me and I can say the blood was shed for me and the life has come down and I've given myself to him as long as I've got Jesus. &gt;&gt; I've got everything. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter if I got the this these followers or that follow that I got that matters not to me. It doesn't matter if somebody comments or somebody don't comment. I could care less. What matters is I got Jesus. &gt;&gt; But more than that, Jesus has got me. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts. Lord, make me more like you. What if what would it be if Jesus would have the same attitude towards us as we have towards other things and all he seen was the negativity? All he seen was the faults. All he could about was this that you know how bad this was how bad the God make me more like you. [Music] Let me see the blood and what it's done. [Music] Let me see. Lord, let me truly see myself as you see me. [Music] Maybe. [Music] Maybe all you can see is mistakes and failures. If I can just somehow get you to see the price Jesus paid for all these mistakes and failures. [Music] you can be free from it. [Music] Won't let me just say to the Lord today, God, help me to see as you see. Help me to look at things as you see them, Lord. I get caught up in every negative thought and negative thinking, even about myself. Let me see you see as you see. Let me see, Lord, that you paid the price. It's finished. It's already done. I don't have to be bound by these things over this condemnation. I ain't got to live under it. Free from it. Lord Jesus, feel like every hand up, Lord, today. God, we just ask Lord that your eyes we can start seeing through those eyes of Christ. We can see you a risen lamb. Lord, what this is all about and what we're all about. Lord Jesus, I pray, Father, you just drop your word into our heart. Lord, if I said anything wrong, you'll forgive me. But Lord, your word will just have preeminence, Lord, in every heart, and every life. We pray. We ask, Lord, you'll just move Lord today in your people. Lord, may somebody walk out of here free from condemnation. Lord, may somebody walk out of here free from negative thoughts, negative thinking. But Lord, may we see you today. Jesus Christ risen among us. The same yesterday, today, and forever. We pray Jesus name. Oh, make me more like thee, Jesus. Make me more like thee. [Music] Give me a heart that's filled with love. filled with a Yes, Lord. And make me more like thee. Make me more like [Music] me. Oh my.

From birth to glory, I holy pass. Oh, to be like him. Amen. And as Sister Glory to sing, there is a blood. I've heard about it preached today and it's true. There is a blood that cost a life that paid my way. Death its price. [Music] And when it flowed down from the cross, my sins were gone. &gt;&gt; My sins forgot. There is a grave that tried to hide. Oh, this precious blood that gave me life. But in three days he breathed again [Music] and he rose to stand in my defense. And so I come to tell you he's alive. To tell you that it drives every tear that falls. Oh, and so I come to tell you that he saves, to shout, and to proclaim that he's coming back for you.

[Music] [Applause] All my words fall short. I've got nothing new. How could I express All my gratitude. I could sing these songs as I often do. Every song will sing you. So I throw up my hands, praise you again and again. All that I have is a [Music] hallelujah. [Music] And I know it's my nothing else for a king for a heart single.

When you see the blood, Brother Brandon when he stepped behind the door changed his perspective and it turned into gratitude. &gt;&gt; No longer condemnation. He's no longer trying to put somebody put a whole building, whole room full of people in the earth. But now he's trying to lift them up before the Lord. Amen. God bless you this morning. let you have your seats for a few minutes. Brother Daryl's going to come and make some announcements. [Music] Amen.
