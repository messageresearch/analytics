[35:34] we were going to have church or not it's
[35:36] always a 50-50 chance at even like
[35:39] Tabernacle not because we don't want
[35:42] it's because Swepco can't provide it so
[35:44] we'll put the blame there but thankfully
[35:46] we were able to have service tonight and
[35:49] I want to speak to you tonight on power
[35:52] restored to the
[35:53] church power restored to the church and
[35:56] I give a second part of this such as I
[35:59] have so we look here it says now Peter
[36:02] and John went up together to the temple
[36:04] at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth
[36:07] hour and a certain man laying from his
[36:09] mother's womb was carried whom they laid
[36:11] daily at the Gate of the temple which is
[36:13] called Beautiful to ask arms of them
[36:16] that entered into the temple who seeing
[36:19] Peter and John about to go into the
[36:21] temple ask in arms and Peter fastening
[36:25] his eyes upon him with John said look on
[36:27] us
[36:28] and he gave heed unto them expecting to
[36:30] receive something of them then Peter
[36:33] said Silver and Gold Have I None but
[36:36] such as I have give I Thee in the name
[36:39] of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and
[36:41] walk and he took him by the right hand
[36:44] and lifted him up and immediately his
[36:46] feet and ankles received strength and he
[36:49] leaping up stood and walked and entered
[36:52] with him into the temple walking and
[36:53] leaping and praising God and all the
[36:56] people saw him walking and praising God
[36:58] and they knew that it was he which sat
[37:01] at arms at the beautiful gate of the
[37:03] temple and they were filled with wonder
[37:05] and amazement at that which had happened
[37:08] unto him God bless you you can have your
[37:09] seats this evening like I said just want
[37:12] to take a little bit of time this
[37:14] evening to kind of bring this out I had
[37:16] a brother asked me the other day as kind
[37:18] of actually was the fuel if you want to
[37:20] call it that for the thought tonight but
[37:22] he asked me about Acts 3 1-7 and he said
[37:26] is this the the third pool in
[37:29] action it's what we see here obviously
[37:32] this was before the third pool because
[37:34] they had the full restoration of the
[37:35] word in that time or the full word but I
[37:38] told him I replied back I said if we
[37:40] believe that the book is open as we find
[37:41] in Revelations 10 and that we are true
[37:44] Born Again Believers that we are the
[37:46] continuation of the book of Acts then we
[37:49] have to believe that this lays in the
[37:52] opening of the word all right we have to
[37:55] believe that now unbelief which is the
[37:57] enemy of our faith is prevalent to try
[37:59] to hinder the individual's Faith to not
[38:01] only believe for these results but also
[38:04] to destroy the expectation that we can
[38:07] have them in our day so you find
[38:10] unbelief is there to say you can't have
[38:12] this Supernatural move in this day
[38:15] because those are a thing of the days
[38:16] gone by but if Jesus Christ is the same
[38:20] yesterday today and forever then he has
[38:23] to do the
[38:24] same he has to work the same
[38:28] he has to heal the same he has to be the
[38:32] same in every detail except his Corporal
[38:36] body but the problem that we find is
[38:38] many message churches and we're not
[38:41] going to pick this one and that one
[38:42] apart but they have sown seeds of word
[38:45] word word word but they have yet to seow
[38:49] the seed of the word and the spirit and
[38:52] the prophet would tell you the mechanics
[38:54] doesn't operate the church it's the
[38:57] spirit that gets upon the mechanics that
[39:00] operates the church and get it moving
[39:02] down the road but they have swn these
[39:04] seeds of the word the word the word but
[39:07] what has been lacking is the spirit in
[39:10] those churches to anoint that word and
[39:12] make it produce exactly what the word
[39:15] declares that it should
[39:17] produce so they focus heavily on the
[39:20] messenger and they focus heavily on
[39:23] message
[39:24] Theology and we have groups today that
[39:27] claim we don't need signs and wonders we
[39:29] don't need the supernatural we're not
[39:31] looking for that we don't need the
[39:33] emotion we don't need all the hoop L we
[39:37] have the revealed word and I will say
[39:40] yes we have the revealed word we have
[39:43] the restored word but if we have the
[39:46] revealed word in this hour and we had
[39:48] the restored word in this hour then it
[39:51] comes with restored power it's not a
[39:54] powerless word we don't have a powerless
[39:57] message it has power in it but it's unto
[40:00] them that will
[40:03] believe it's unto them that can
[40:08] believe so we look at it the word
[40:12] here the word in this hour has always
[40:15] been accompanied by the
[40:19] spirit and it's accompanied with power
[40:21] to make that word produce and I'll say
[40:25] it tonight what good is the word if it
[40:28] can't
[40:29] produce what good is planting a seed and
[40:32] going through all the effort for that
[40:34] seed to to come up if we know when we
[40:37] plant it it will not
[40:39] produce when I put it there I have no
[40:42] expectation of harvesting a garden and
[40:45] that's the same as it is with many
[40:47] there's no expectation there's no
[40:49] preaching of Faith there's no preaching
[40:51] of an expectation of the movement of the
[40:54] spirit we got the word
[40:57] but I'm here to tell you even theight we
[40:59] want more than the word the prophet of
[41:01] God said they had the written word all
[41:03] down Through the Ages but what they
[41:05] failed to get was the revealed word
[41:08] because with the revealed word comes
[41:10] revealed power it comes a spirit to
[41:13] anoint that word to give it a revelation
[41:16] to make it manifest and
[41:19] produce in Jehovah J the Bible would say
[41:22] all that the polymer worm had left the
[41:24] caterpillar leading and all that the
[41:26] caterpillar left you know this one had
[41:28] eaten and that one and eaten he said the
[41:29] Luther left the Methodist eaten and the
[41:32] Methodist left the Baptist is eaten and
[41:33] what the Baptist left the Pentecostal is
[41:36] eaten the whole thing is cut
[41:39] down but God
[41:42] saids we're not worried about what the
[41:44] seeds say we're not worried about what
[41:45] these insects say excuse me but what God
[41:48] Said I will restore sayth the Lord he
[41:52] said all the years not just a portion
[41:55] not just a little bit here not just not
[41:58] not just enough Faith to believe not
[42:00] just enough Holy Ghost to be Sanctified
[42:02] I'm going to restore all that these
[42:05] insects have eaten down notice what he
[42:08] says he goes I will send back another
[42:10] church in the last days let me tell you
[42:12] we're in the last
[42:13] days I'll send back another church in
[42:16] the last days and I will restore the
[42:19] original Power again there's going to be
[42:21] a church in the last day that's going to
[42:23] operate under the original Power oh
[42:27] Hallelujah somebody should say praise
[42:29] God tonight we're not a people that's
[42:31] not believeing but we believe in the
[42:33] word of God we believe in the power
[42:35] that's associated with the
[42:38] word I will restore that original Power
[42:42] again notice the terminology in which he
[42:46] uses the original
[42:49] Power so that which was poured out on
[42:53] the day of Pentecost was the original
[42:55] Power
[42:57] and he says I'm going to restore it or
[43:00] pour it out again on the last day
[43:03] church so take your Bibles and you come
[43:07] through the book of
[43:08] Acts and you can see what we are to
[43:12] produce yes sir we are to see we claim
[43:16] as messes Believers that we're not
[43:18] another book of Acts we are the
[43:20] continuation of the book of Acts but as
[43:23] a message community in the whole I
[43:25] wonder if we truly believe that because
[43:27] we shut the book because we're afraid of
[43:30] the
[43:31] supernatural but the prophet forewarned
[43:34] us he told us God is going to restore
[43:37] that original Power I say God pour it
[43:39] out on me if the world don't want it
[43:42] I'll take it if they don't want their
[43:44] portion I'll take another portion how W
[43:47] that original Holy Ghost how W that
[43:49] original Power let me tell you it come
[43:51] it's more than just jumping and
[43:54] shouting it's more than speaking in
[43:56] tongues and gifts but it's the power to
[43:59] live an overcoming life it's the power
[44:01] to rise up in the darkest age and live
[44:04] for Christ and be victorious over the
[44:06] enemy that's what comes with that
[44:08] original
[44:13] Power and if we either believe what this
[44:16] Prophet says or we don't believe
[44:19] it and I'm sorry to say that
[44:22] many many of our comrades many of our
[44:25] fellow soldiers fellow message churches
[44:27] they don't believe this but we're not
[44:30] going to labor that point but if the
[44:32] message if the message has been given to
[44:34] us in this day and we believe that it
[44:35] has and the message came and what did it
[44:38] do God used the messenger to open the
[44:40] seals and we understand the lamb opened
[44:43] the seals and he gave it to the seventh
[44:44] angel that seventh angel begin to give
[44:47] that word unto us the people of the open
[44:50] book let me tell you when he opened the
[44:52] book there was power laying in that book
[44:55] there was things that hadn't been seen
[44:56] in a long time time it was the book of
[44:58] redemption and they laid power there for
[45:00] people that was going to have Rapture in
[45:02] Faith Church it's going to come by
[45:05] rapturing message by preaching the Full
[45:07] Gospel of the
[45:12] word and I'll say it like this tonight
[45:14] if this
[45:16] message is not it then where do we will
[45:20] we find the source of this
[45:23] power where will we find if this message
[45:26] is not it and the original power
[45:28] restored back to a church then we as a
[45:31] message Community has have missed it
[45:34] we've missed it we need to keep on
[45:36] looking this ain't it but I'm like like
[45:39] brother B was said hey this is that and
[45:42] if this ain't that I'll keep this until
[45:45] that comes but I'm here to declare to
[45:47] you evening life this is that the
[45:49] restored power of the original word is
[45:52] about living among a people we're not
[45:54] waiting on it it's here
[45:57] I've seen we've seen cancer defeated in
[46:00] this church what was that restored power
[46:04] we seen alipa defeated a little girl's
[46:06] hair grow back that was restored power
[46:10] we seen a little boy never walk got up
[46:12] and run around the house restored
[46:14] power oh we seen prodical come back home
[46:18] restored
[46:23] power it's more than speaking in tongues
[46:26] it's more than running around it's
[46:28] seeing the manifestation of the
[46:30] word and we are seeing it sir we would
[46:33] see
[46:36] Jesus I say we're seeing them we're
[46:40] seeing them we seeing the mighty moving
[46:42] of the spirit of
[46:44] God let's look here in Acts two because
[46:47] this is where we can kind of help draw
[46:49] our parallel from acts two and acts
[46:51] three the Bible says in Acts 2 and verse
[46:53] one and when the day of Pentecost was
[46:55] fully come they were all in one Accord
[46:57] in one place and suddenly there came a
[46:59] sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty
[47:02] Wind and it filled the house where they
[47:05] were sitting and there appeared unto
[47:07] them clothing tongues like as fire and
[47:09] it sat upon them and they were filled
[47:11] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[47:14] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[47:16] them utters now brother BR says that's
[47:18] the
[47:19] Loos and the Loos begin to divide and
[47:22] separate itself and come among this one
[47:25] and that one and that one and that one
[47:28] let me tell you 500 were told to go to
[47:30] the upper room but only 120 obeyed the
[47:33] word and got the Holy
[47:34] Ghost it's not for everybody but it's
[47:37] for the elect and the prophet of God
[47:39] said this message ain't for everybody
[47:41] but it's for the elect and if you're the
[47:43] elect you can't help but receive it you
[47:45] can't help but be a part of it because
[47:47] why because there's something pulling
[47:48] you into that place to be filled with
[47:51] that
[47:52] power so all that Christ was we
[47:55] understand he he empties into his church
[47:59] cuz all that God was he poured it into
[48:00] Christ and all that Christ was he
[48:02] empties into this church and we find
[48:04] that the same light that Christ shined
[48:06] they were now
[48:07] shining the same power that they
[48:10] displayed that Christ displayed they
[48:11] were Now display the same works that
[48:14] Christ performed they would now perform
[48:17] what he was they have
[48:19] become what he did they were now
[48:23] doing and if we can believe this for
[48:25] them then why can't can't we believe
[48:27] this for us in our day why can't we
[48:30] believe he said he' pour out his Spirit
[48:33] upon All
[48:37] Flesh notice in Acts 2 and verse4 and
[48:40] Peter this is Peter's sermon at
[48:42] Pentecost now Peter went in there a
[48:45] denier he went into Pentecost where he
[48:48] went into the upper room a cursor a Deni
[48:52] a
[48:53] coward but here he comes after the
[48:56] indwelling of the spirit something
[48:58] changed Peter let me tell you when you
[49:01] get the Holy Ghost it changes you I look
[49:03] at Silas green here tonight I'm like I
[49:05] remember the kid he was six seven years
[49:07] ago but oh One Moment In The Presence of
[49:10] the pillar of fire completely rewrites
[49:13] your life completely changes who you are
[49:16] you may have walked in one way he went
[49:18] to a camp meeting one way but let me
[49:20] tell you God got a hold of them and he
[49:22] came back a different person that's what
[49:25] happens in the presence of the Ang angel
[49:27] of God it happens in the presence of the
[49:29] pillar of
[49:30] fire notice what he says Peter standing
[49:33] up with the 11 lifted up his voice and
[49:35] said unto them you men of Judea all he
[49:38] says and all ye that are dwell in
[49:40] Jerusalem be you known this day and
[49:42] hearken to my words for these are not
[49:44] drunken as you
[49:46] suppose see people begin to criticize
[49:48] because they were a little bit
[49:50] loose they were
[49:53] intoxicated with some revelation
[49:56] got excited when the when the Winds of
[49:59] Pentecost begin to blow through man blow
[50:02] through here oright Pentecost let the
[50:04] winds blow through here tonight some of
[50:06] us have needs tonight some of us have
[50:08] great needs won't you just blow through
[50:10] here tonight Lord we'll we'll we'll just
[50:11] let you completely consume us tonight
[50:13] whatever you want we want you to have
[50:15] free rain free course whatever it is but
[50:18] Peter says these are not drunken as you
[50:20] supposed seeing but it's the third hour
[50:22] today but this is that which was spoken
[50:26] by the prophet
[50:27] Joy it shall come to pass in the last
[50:30] days say the Lord I'll pour out my
[50:32] spirit Upon Our flesh and your sons and
[50:34] your daughters shall prophesy and your
[50:35] young men shall see visions and your old
[50:37] men shall dream dreams and upon my
[50:39] servants and my handmaidens I'll pour
[50:41] out my I'll pour it out in those days of
[50:43] my spirit and they shall prophesy verse
[50:46] 19 and I will show wonders in heaven and
[50:49] signs in the earth beneath blood and
[50:50] fire and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be
[50:53] turned into darkness the moon into blood
[50:55] before the great and notable day of the
[50:56] the Lord and it shall come to pass that
[50:58] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[51:00] the Lord shall be
[51:03] saved so here Peter was a coward when he
[51:07] went in but he received a holy ghost
[51:10] boldness he went in when he come out he
[51:12] wasn't afraid to stand before the
[51:14] Sadducees he wasn't afraid to stand
[51:16] before the Romans and the Pharisees no
[51:18] he had a boldness about him and when you
[51:20] receive the Holy Ghost it puts a courage
[51:23] on the Gable end of your soul you're not
[51:25] ashamed of this message you're not
[51:26] ashamed to stand for this
[51:31] truth
[51:33] notice this scripture this portion here
[51:35] has a double
[51:36] meaning there was a prophecy Joel's
[51:39] prophecy referred that that initial
[51:41] outpouring was going to be at the end of
[51:43] the Jewish dispensation then there is a
[51:47] gentile dispensation that he's going to
[51:49] do it again it's going to be a
[51:50] restoration it's going to be the same
[51:52] pouring out of the same original
[51:53] Pentecostal power and we find here Peter
[51:56] didn't Point them to himself Peter
[51:58] didn't Point him nobody to his church
[52:01] Peter didn't get all the news cameras
[52:03] and say I want you to live stream my
[52:04] sermon Peter pointed them back to the
[52:07] word back to Joel's prophecy and
[52:10] everything we preach here comes right
[52:12] back to the word it's not man's idea
[52:15] it's not man-made Creeds and man-made
[52:17] Dogma it comes right from the message of
[52:20] the hour and it comes right through the
[52:22] Holy Ghost Bible
[52:24] Church Peter was a spokesman but he
[52:27] pointed everybody back to the
[52:30] word but you know there was doubters
[52:33] there oh they're just drunk oh they're
[52:36] just all giddy they you know here it was
[52:38] the third hour of the day 9:00 in the
[52:41] morning you know how they are you know
[52:44] what if God's going to do anything he's
[52:45] going to do it in my
[52:46] church he didn't come to my Bishop he
[52:49] didn't he come to my
[52:52] synagogue no but Peter be to reassure
[52:54] them and reaffirm to them that what
[52:57] you're witnessing is not a carnal
[53:00] Behavior that's been Intoxicated by
[53:03] filthy luer or drink or anything of that
[53:05] nature but what you're witnessing is a
[53:07] move of the
[53:08] supernatural I can't help that you've
[53:10] never seen it before I can't help but
[53:12] it's not in your church I'm pointing you
[53:14] back to the word it's there Joel said
[53:16] it'll be there Joel said he said he'll
[53:19] pour it out in the last days this is the
[53:21] last days this is what we've been
[53:22] waiting for this is the moment and it's
[53:24] here church and Peter begin to tell 120
[53:27] it's here that which we had been waiting
[53:29] for that that outpouring of power is
[53:32] here now we don't have to be afraid we
[53:34] can walk out in Victory knowing that
[53:37] that which has been prophesied is now
[53:39] being made
[53:40] manifest I say man aest is upon us oh
[53:43] God L we look here in Joel 2 and verse
[53:48] 28 we're going to look at what Peter how
[53:50] Peter came to this he said it shall come
[53:52] to pass afterward that I'm going to pour
[53:54] out my spirit Upon Our flesh and your
[53:55] sons and your your daughters shall
[53:57] prophesy and your old men shall dream
[53:59] dreams and your young men shall see
[54:00] Visions notice as brother Tim made a
[54:03] great statement this past Sunday he's
[54:05] been doing that for 2,000 years hul down
[54:07] through the church ages that's what
[54:09] we've been seeing what was Luther's
[54:11] message it was a part of this pouring
[54:13] out Wesley's message was a another part
[54:15] of this pouring out the restoration of
[54:17] the gifts and Pentecost was another part
[54:19] of this pouring out oh but Church in the
[54:22] evening light in the evening time under
[54:25] the evening light brother said this is
[54:26] the evening time of my message in the
[54:28] evening time the token was applied in
[54:31] the evening time the the Holy Ghost The
[54:33] lital Life of Christ now comes back on
[54:36] the believer you telling me we got the
[54:38] literal Life of Christ in this hour in
[54:41] this day and it has no power to make the
[54:44] word live has no power for healing for
[54:47] deliverance for prodical come on
[54:49] somebody we got the token in this
[54:52] hour the original Power has been
[54:55] restored back to the original
[54:59] Church W what a
[55:02] promise notice here in Romans 8 verse 9
[55:05] but you're not in the spirit but in the
[55:08] OR but you're not in the flesh excuse me
[55:09] but you're in the spirit it so be that
[55:11] the spirit of God dwell in you now if
[55:13] any man have not the spirit of Christ he
[55:16] is none of
[55:17] his and if Christ be in you the body is
[55:20] dead because of sin but the spirit is
[55:22] life because of righteousness but the
[55:25] spirit of him that raised raised up
[55:26] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[55:30] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[55:32] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[55:36] spirit that dwelleth in you
[55:39] notice Paul is emphasizing the spirit
[55:43] not the
[55:45] word the spirit because if the spirit is
[55:49] in you it's going to Quicken your body
[55:51] you're going to see the word you're
[55:53] going to become one with the word so the
[55:55] key to this entire scripture here is the
[55:58] spirit of Christ dwelling in us for
[56:01] without his Spirit we're none of his
[56:03] well I believe God sent a prophet I'm
[56:05] sorry without his Spirit you're none of
[56:06] his I believe the message I believe the
[56:09] message without his Spirit you're none
[56:11] of his many are come to me in that days
[56:13] Lord we did this and Lord we did that
[56:15] and we did this in your name and that in
[56:17] your name and he said depart from me I
[56:19] never knew you he never was acquainted
[56:23] with you why cuz he's only coming for
[56:25] those that have his
[56:28] Spirit oh you can confess to believe the
[56:30] message oh I don't cut my hair I don't
[56:32] wear makeup I live clean I live golly
[56:34] you can confess to believe God sent a
[56:36] prophet and you done listen to all the
[56:38] sermons that he preached 1200 two or
[56:40] three four or five times I don't care
[56:42] but without his Spirit
[56:44] Church without the spirit of God to
[56:47] anoint your life and without the spirit
[56:49] of God to anoint this word we're no more
[56:51] than a
[56:53] denomination that's what separates us
[56:55] apart is the
[56:57] spirit cuz the spirit has the power and
[57:00] I'm here to tell you it's restored back

[1:01:05] wants from you as his subjects tonight
[1:01:07] as his sons and his daughters just take
[1:01:10] me at my
[1:01:12] word brother Timothy loves to tell that
[1:01:14] story about the king this one asked for
[1:01:17] a duck and this one asked for a cow and
[1:01:19] this one he didn't give him that he
[1:01:21] didn't give him that another one comes I

[1:01:33] the world did you just do that when you
[1:01:35] wouldn't give this one a duck you
[1:01:36] wouldn't give this one a cow he said
[1:01:38] because he he approached me and asked
[1:01:41] something that only a king can give oh
[1:01:44] church either we believe that we're
[1:01:45] subjects to the king and he can provide
[1:01:48] that which we have not let me tell you
[1:01:50] such as I have he said I'll give it to
[1:01:52] you whatever he can lead you to believe

[1:06:43] shall
[1:06:45] call so the promise wasn't just for the
[1:06:48] 120 in the upper room cuz if you
[1:06:50] continue to read in Acts you find out
[1:06:52] when they left the upper room many
[1:06:56] were added to 3,000 Souls if I'm not
[1:06:59] mistaken were added to because they saw
[1:07:02] the promise manifest they saw the power
[1:07:05] begin to live out through human V
[1:07:10] vessels here we find brother BR tells us
[1:07:12] as we keep going down in Easter C he
[1:07:13] said the works that I do shall you do
[1:07:15] also these signs shall follow them that
[1:07:17] believe that is the
[1:07:20] Assurance well we believe the word
[1:07:23] where's your sign now I'm not say we're
[1:07:25] not sign
[1:07:27] Seekers but what separates us from
[1:07:29] denominations what separates us is the
[1:07:32] signs shall follow them that believe and
[1:07:35] brother B says now it's God's promise
[1:07:36] he'd pour out his spirit in the last
[1:07:38] days and that's what they do they laid
[1:07:40] their hands on the sick everything that
[1:07:42] was in God's promise I shall pour out my
[1:07:44] spirit in the last days upon All Flesh
[1:07:46] your old men shall dream dreams your
[1:07:47] young men shall see visions and all
[1:07:49] these different promises that he made
[1:07:51] everything is laying right there in
[1:07:53] God's promise and he said Jesus redeemed
[1:07:55] it to
[1:07:58] us he redeemed it to us not for us to
[1:08:03] us take it church if you're ordained on
[1:08:07] that ground the holy spirit is here to
[1:08:09] find you and when it finds you you
[1:08:10] recognize it's call you know the hour
[1:08:12] you're living you know that these things
[1:08:14] are supposed to happen see the spirit
[1:08:16] quickened their fellowship with God that
[1:08:18] they can even speak life to the dead and
[1:08:21] they'd raiseed back
[1:08:23] up I'm talking about a power
[1:08:26] that was poured out on that day that was
[1:08:29] prophesied to be poured out again in the
[1:08:31] last days our
[1:08:34] day well B said now let's notice
[1:08:37] Pentecost how they
[1:08:40] acted y'all want to me to stop y'all
[1:08:44] good let's notice Pentecost how they
[1:08:47] acted and see if they were quickened by
[1:08:49] the quickening power that they were
[1:08:51] talking about on the day of Pentecost
[1:08:53] they were all waiting up there kind of
[1:08:54] like where we're doing T night waiting
[1:08:57] in themselves they were afraid the Jews
[1:08:59] they just you know he said they just
[1:09:01] what they were going to do they they
[1:09:02] were scared but what happened when the
[1:09:04] quicking power fell from heaven there
[1:09:06] was a bravery set upon them there was
[1:09:09] something an understanding there wasn't
[1:09:11] too they wasn't too sure in a few hours
[1:09:14] before but you know they they had been
[1:09:16] he said they had died but here on the
[1:09:18] day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit the
[1:09:20] abstract upon the Believers now he said
[1:09:23] that made them part of the Resurrection
[1:09:25] made him part of this Fellowship the
[1:09:27] Holy Ghost came and confirmed it to them
[1:09:29] and they would be raised up because why
[1:09:31] they were potentially raised with them
[1:09:33] from cowards to brave
[1:09:39] men and no matter if you got a ba a DD d
[1:09:42] a dou l d a q s t it don't mean anything
[1:09:45] to
[1:09:46] God you can out quote the quot is person
[1:09:49] you want to quote it doesn't matter you
[1:09:51] can recite the entire book of Hebrews it
[1:09:53] doesn't matter but till a man gets on
[1:09:56] the backside of The Burning Sands of the
[1:09:57] de and meets God face to face he has no
[1:10:00] right to stand behind this sacred desk
[1:10:03] we have seen men anointed men we've seen
[1:10:05] gifted men and the Bible says gifts and
[1:10:07] callings are without repentance we've
[1:10:09] seen gifted men great Orchard speak and
[1:10:11] it seems like they move the people those
[1:10:13] same men today have turned their backs
[1:10:15] on this message those men today sum in
[1:10:18] pedophile Su in pornography some in
[1:10:20] homosexuality many of them back in sin
[1:10:23] but what am I telling you if you ever
[1:10:25] meet God you ever get filled with the
[1:10:27] Holy Ghost there ain't no worry about
[1:10:29] going back you can't go back to that
[1:10:33] lifestyle there's no pull for that
[1:10:35] lifestyle there's no desire for that
[1:10:38] lifestyle that's why we want anointed
[1:10:41] preachers not just great teachers
[1:10:44] teachers have their place long as
[1:10:46] they're anointed teachers not just
[1:10:48] evangelist who can fire up a crowd we
[1:10:50] want evangelist that are anointed
[1:10:52] evangelists
[1:10:55] that had met
[1:11:00] God
[1:11:01] Peter and
[1:11:04] John here we find them in Acts three
[1:11:07] brother Braham said they just left
[1:11:10] Pentecost four
[1:11:12] days from that great outpouring could
[1:11:16] you
[1:11:17] imagine man could you imagine the
[1:11:20] excitement could you imagine the
[1:11:23] overwhelming power and just the sense of
[1:11:26] urgency that these two men walked
[1:11:29] with it's like coming out of one of our
[1:11:31] great meetings you come to that prayer
[1:11:34] line all of a sudden power of God rushes
[1:11:36] over you and gives you what you need
[1:11:39] man you ready to face any devil well
[1:11:43] Peter and John just left Pentecost just
[1:11:46] got it
[1:11:47] changed from a coward to a brave man
[1:11:51] from a liar from a deceiver from a dener
[1:11:54] from a cursor to the spokesman of the
[1:11:57] church and what was he doing he wasn't
[1:11:59] going to work John wasn't going to work
[1:12:02] they were going back to a place of
[1:12:05] worship they couldn't get enough Gods
[1:12:08] woo man boy you can't preach at of many
[1:12:11] messes
[1:12:12] churches so of them want man they got
[1:12:14] they ran out of peanut butter and they
[1:12:16] got a toothache and they got this but
[1:12:18] they just got inow and here they go on
[1:12:21] the way to church to begin to worship
[1:12:23] God and they met a lame
[1:12:26] man the Bible says he was lay from his
[1:12:29] mother's
[1:12:30] womb 40 something years old and daily he
[1:12:33] had to be carried and placed in his spot
[1:12:38] CU see they all had spots in that day
[1:12:41] this is where you're going to be seated
[1:12:43] and this is where you're going to do
[1:12:45] your begging and your arms giving and
[1:12:47] they would typically place them either
[1:12:49] at intersections on highways or Temple
[1:12:53] worship things like that so they can see
[1:12:55] a lot of people and what we find here
[1:12:58] Peter he cut a man's ear off Lord
[1:13:01] wherever you go I'm going to go he was
[1:13:04] so
[1:13:05] vicious and he was overwhelmed but the
[1:13:08] first strike of trouble he denied him I
[1:13:11] don't know this
[1:13:14] man but something happened in the upper
[1:13:18] room something changed him brother
[1:13:22] Daryl something completely Revolution
[1:13:25] his makeup and let me tell you it has to
[1:13:28] do us the same you can't just say well I
[1:13:30] go to Tim puis church and I always go
[1:13:32] into a message Church you got to meet
[1:13:34] this change you got to meet the power
[1:13:37] that changed Peter you got to meet that
[1:13:39] same power that's going to Rapture your
[1:13:41] body claiming Tim prud as your pastor
[1:13:44] claiming this one as your church this
[1:13:46] one is your daddy and the he's a deacon
[1:13:48] here and all that that has nothing to do
[1:13:50] with it you got to meet
[1:13:52] him whether you're young you're old you
[1:13:56] got to meet
[1:13:57] Christ notice when he come out of that
[1:14:00] Upper Room it changed his walk it
[1:14:02] changed his talk it changed his life it
[1:14:04] made a real Son of God out of him it put
[1:14:07] a boldness in there where they he was
[1:14:09] ashamed of the message at one point but
[1:14:11] the power of Pentecost changed and
[1:14:14] transformed Peter's life and I'm here to
[1:14:16] tell you that same power in this hour
[1:14:18] it's got to transform Our Lives it's got
[1:14:21] to transform our thinking and we got to
[1:14:23] be transformed and conf formed not to
[1:14:25] the world but transformed by the
[1:14:27] renewing of our minds in this message in
[1:14:32] Christ Peter and John went up there to
[1:14:35] the temple acts three in verse one and a
[1:14:37] certain lame man from his mother's womb
[1:14:38] was carried whom they laid daily at the
[1:14:41] Gate of the temple which is called
[1:14:43] Beautiful to ask arms of them that enter
[1:14:45] the temple who seeing Peter and John
[1:14:47] about to go into the temple he asked of
[1:14:52] arms y'all see them people at Walmart
[1:14:56] ringing her Bell what do you
[1:15:04] do you know they they were they was on
[1:15:07] this side when you went in so you go on
[1:15:09] the other
[1:15:11] side come
[1:15:15] on he's asking arms this is the only
[1:15:18] thing he's ever known he was a beggar
[1:15:21] always been a
[1:15:23] beggar this he paid his bills this is
[1:15:26] how he made a living this is how he took
[1:15:27] care of his
[1:15:30] family but there's something different
[1:15:32] about that
[1:15:34] day there was something different about
[1:15:38] that day maybe it was February
[1:15:41] 12th that
[1:15:44] day Peter and John was going to the
[1:15:47] church to
[1:15:49] worship instead of turning their back on
[1:15:52] them

[1:17:45] when you know you're different you're
[1:17:46] not afraid to share it with
[1:17:49] anybody I've been helping back out at
[1:17:51] the hospital and there was a new girl
[1:17:52] there who uh is in the AP apartment she
[1:17:55] came in last week and she said look I I
[1:17:58] just wanted to tell you that they found
[1:18:00] something on my brain and they found a
[1:18:02] little tumor or whatnot on my brain and
[1:18:04] I'm not sure what's going to happen and
[1:18:06] we're going to go in for some tests and
[1:18:08] different things of that nature and I
[1:18:09] rose up out of my seat I said you I'll
[1:18:11] tell you what I said I'm a holy ghost fi
[1:18:14] preacher and I said I believe in the
[1:18:16] power of the
[1:18:17] Supernatural and I laid hands on her and
[1:18:20] I began to pray the prayer of faith I
[1:18:21] wasn't ashamed of this message I wasn't
[1:18:23] ashamed of this gospel you say well it's
[1:18:25] just to the messages no it's not to just
[1:18:27] message Believers it's to whosoever will
[1:18:30] I had enough Faith to believe and she
[1:18:32] came in my office today and she said

[1:18:35] results back either they going to either
[1:18:37] uh let it go on and be the same or

[1:18:41] going to drain it or they going to open
[1:18:42] it up and remove it I said well don't
[1:18:45] don't you fear I said the right mental
[1:18:47] attitude toward any Divine promise of
[1:18:49] God you can have it and I begin to show
[1:18:52] her in the word that by his stripes your
[1:18:54] already
[1:18:55] healed pointed back to the word I
[1:18:58] invited her to church tonight she didn't
[1:18:59] make it I don't think but that's okay

[1:19:02] point but you never know why God places
[1:19:05] you in a
[1:19:06] place God placed that beggar there but
[1:19:09] he had a Peter and a John come by one
[1:19:11] day and God placed me there and placed
[1:19:14] her there she just started about two
[1:19:15] months ago place and it may be for her
[1:19:18] Deliverance for the supernatural God to
[1:19:20] move upon that soul and begin to come
[1:19:23] down upon her more than just just a
[1:19:25] brain surgery but a heart surgery we

[1:20:20] wonders the power that lays in this word
[1:20:24] will prod produce it in your
[1:20:26] life and the prophet said it's the
[1:20:29] Assurance of a
[1:20:31] promise it's the
[1:20:34] Assurance of the promise so Christ is
[1:20:37] among
[1:20:38] us then what he performed in that

[1:20:55] tonight just take the handcuffs off of
[1:20:58] them I was reading it again just the
[1:20:59] other day brother BR said I believe
[1:21:02] there's things that God can do that's
[1:21:04] not even written in the
[1:21:06] Bible he said when Moses raised a brass
[1:21:10] serpent on the pole they never they
[1:21:12] never had it done before maybe many of
[1:21:15] them came Moses what are you doing why
[1:21:17] we've never done this he said God told
[1:21:19] me to do it but today we get so carnal
[1:21:23] we get so clicky so handcuffed the Holy
[1:21:25] Spirit we don't see it it ain't never
[1:21:27] been done and it ain't never been spoke
[1:21:29] of we don't think God can do it let the
[1:21:31] Holy Ghost Holy Ghost one time let them

[1:21:35] house let them move in your marriage let
[1:21:37] them move in your home let the Holy
[1:21:39] Ghost do what he declares he can
[1:21:42] do take the handcuffs off the
[1:21:46] spirit restore power back to the
[1:21:50] church brother B says we got untapped
[1:21:53] resources of God at our
[1:21:56] hands come on church either you believe
[1:21:58] that or you don't untapped
[1:22:03] resources we're Sons and Daughters of
[1:22:06] God God made man he made him in he made
[1:22:09] him a God he gave him dominion over the
[1:22:10] Earth but his Fallen estate dropped that
[1:22:13] oh but what they lost by Adam it was
[1:22:16] restored by
[1:22:18] Christ he said if you say to this
[1:22:20] mountain be moved and not doubt in your
[1:22:21] heart but believe that which you what
[1:22:24] you as shall come to pass you can have
[1:22:26] what You'
[1:22:29] said all things whatsoever you desire
[1:22:32] When you pray believe that you receive
[1:22:34] it and you shall have it amen He
[1:22:37] restored to us all that was lost in Adam
[1:22:41] instead of advancing
[1:22:44] on and see what God promised a lot of
[1:22:47] times we want to look back and see what
[1:22:48] that one said about it this is your
[1:22:51] Prophet Queen of Sheba he said let's not
[1:22:54] look back back look forward keep moving
[1:22:56] on well I just need to see what this
[1:22:58] brother what this church says about it
[1:23:00] I'm going to stream in and see what
[1:23:01] they're
[1:23:03] preaching no just keep moving
[1:23:07] on God gave you a gifted ministry here
[1:23:10] you ain't got to go looking around
[1:23:11] somewhere else don't be looking at what
[1:23:13] this one says that one says it don't
[1:23:14] matter what they say God gave you a
[1:23:16] Shepherd to Shepherd you right into the
[1:23:20] Rapture quit listening to all the other
[1:23:23] voices listen to the voice that's right
[1:23:25] here preaching Faith to you
[1:23:29] tonight I'm going to go on just a little
[1:23:31] bit
[1:23:32] further if you say to this mountain be
[1:23:34] moved and not doubt in your heart but
[1:23:35] believe that what you have said will
[1:23:36] come to pass you can have whatsoever you
[1:23:38] said no conditions it's not it's just
[1:23:41] unlimited whatever things you desire
[1:23:42] When you pray believe you receive it
[1:23:44] then you shall have them whatsoever
[1:23:46] Divine Healing joy peace
[1:23:50] anything amen and Paul would tell us in
[1:23:53] 1 Corinthians 2 and verse four my speech
[1:23:56] and my preaching was not with enticing
[1:23:57] words of man's Wisdom but in
[1:23:59] demonstration of the spirit and of power
[1:24:04] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:24:06] wisdom of men but in the power of
[1:24:09] God so Paul the first church age
[1:24:12] messenger established the church not
[1:24:14] just on merely the
[1:24:17] word but the word in power the word with
[1:24:22] spirit and I believe the last last day
[1:24:25] messenger said I preach exactly what
[1:24:28] Paul
[1:24:29] preached establish this Gentile Bride on
[1:24:34] not just the word but the word with
[1:24:36] power the word with Spirit mechanics and
[1:24:43] Dynamics my brother tell I'm not nature
[1:24:45] that way that's fine it's
[1:24:48] okay just get loose one time let the
[1:24:50] Holy Ghost let the dynamic strike
[1:24:53] you don't put handcuffs on
[1:24:56] it let me just keep going here he says
[1:24:58] we must cope our lives and focus it into
[1:25:02] the word of God if you talking about a
[1:25:04] camera you got to focus know sometimes
[1:25:05] you get out of vision and you got four
[1:25:07] or five things but you got to focus it
[1:25:09] says focus it right on the word of God
[1:25:12] not on man not on certain Dynamic
[1:25:16] Ministries not on
[1:25:20] gifts focus it on the word take it back
[1:25:24] back to the
[1:25:25] word he said then the church would be
[1:25:27] moving on without friction without hurt
[1:25:30] without harm without doubts without
[1:25:31] Scruples without friction it would be
[1:25:34] moving in the power of the word of God
[1:25:37] manifesting every divine blessing that
[1:25:39] God promised to it if it just do that
[1:25:43] just
[1:25:45] focus just
[1:25:47] focus sometimes we come and sometimes
[1:25:50] you have to plow huh brother Tim man it
[1:25:52] just takes forever to get you to focus
[1:25:55] so try to get you to focus you got you
[1:25:57] got your mind start on everything work
[1:25:59] tomorrow and this problem and that
[1:26:01] problem and this hurt and that hurt but
[1:26:03] just get
[1:26:04] focused get your focus off your
[1:26:07] condition get your focus off your
[1:26:08] lameness get your focus off of what's
[1:26:10] going on all the drama around you get
[1:26:12] focused on the word and the promise for
[1:26:16] you some of you been waiting for God to
[1:26:19] move he's here to move for you
[1:26:22] tonight notice Peter and John didn't
[1:26:26] just look at this Lane man but they put
[1:26:30] what they received four days prior to
[1:26:34] action it was more than just a
[1:26:38] confession see brother BR would tell us
[1:26:40] in God's identifying himself by his
[1:26:42] characteristics it's identified by his
[1:26:45] word then it's it's his characteristics
[1:26:46] proves what it is it's God In Action
[1:26:50] again greater than Solomon is here a
[1:26:52] real believer wants to see God in
[1:26:56] action come on even light what do you
[1:26:58] want to see tonight we don't want to see
[1:27:00] cold formal sleepy people we want to see
[1:27:03] God we want to see the Living God In
[1:27:06] Action in our midst we want to see the
[1:27:09] supernatural we want to see the prodical
[1:27:11] come back we want to see cancer defeated
[1:27:14] we want to see alopecia defeated we want
[1:27:16] to see the
[1:27:17] supernatural we want to see God in
[1:27:20] action not man in action not this in
[1:27:23] action but God In
[1:27:27] Action we're not here to draw people to
[1:27:30] our s Kingdom building we're here to
[1:27:32] draw people to God put him in
[1:27:35] action so I challenge your faith what is
[1:27:38] it when the prophet saw that he was in
[1:27:40] the presence of God he humbled himself
[1:27:43] talking about Isaiah look first he
[1:27:46] humbled himself then the fire cleansed
[1:27:49] him and after the fire cleansed him then
[1:27:52] he was then he was a cleansed Isaiah
[1:27:55] when he had heard the voice of God who
[1:27:57] will go for
[1:27:58] me he went into
[1:28:03] action come on Holy Ghost
[1:28:06] believers who will go for him
[1:28:09] tonight ah I want to be put in action he
[1:28:14] says here I am send me he said that was
[1:28:16] a call of a clean Isaiah after the Holy
[1:28:19] Ghost had cleansed him he didn't need
[1:28:21] any Seminary experience he didn't need
[1:28:22] any book of experience he had been
[1:28:24] cleansed by the fire of God and called
[1:28:26] into action what was it he said when he
[1:28:29] seen God In Action he went in action
[1:28:33] when we see God in action it's time for
[1:28:35] the church to get into action and be
[1:28:38] examples of what God is do you believe
[1:28:43] that see get into action not in action
[1:28:46] let me let me just bring this down not
[1:28:48] in the action of destroying this
[1:28:51] church and throwing accusations over
[1:28:54] this church because we see things
[1:28:55] different we're going to always probably
[1:28:57] see things different we're not in the
[1:29:00] action of throwing this one and hurting
[1:29:02] this one and destroying their Ministry
[1:29:04] and destroying this church for what it
[1:29:05] does no get into
[1:29:07] action building up the people around
[1:29:11] you restored
[1:29:18] promise you say well brother Joe I don't
[1:29:20] I don't believe in all this Supernatural
[1:29:23] bit that's going on it just seems like a
[1:29:25] lot of hoopla and fluffy fluffy stuff
[1:29:28] and a lot of emotion what did Gil you
[1:29:30] tell those great
[1:29:32] men he said Brothers we've seen this man
[1:29:35] come and it went in destruction we've
[1:29:37] seen this man come and it went in
[1:29:38] destruction the people perish if this is
[1:29:41] not of
[1:29:43] God if what I'm preaching to you about
[1:29:46] tonight the supernatural restored power
[1:29:48] among a living bride if it's not of God
[1:29:50] it will come to
[1:29:52] not but don't be found found fighting
[1:29:56] against the
[1:29:57] spirit don't be found fighting against
[1:30:01] the power that's been released in this
[1:30:03] day to change your
[1:30:06] body say Lord I believe but help thou my
[1:30:11] unbelief don't be one look Jesus said I
[1:30:14] don't do these works it's the father in
[1:30:18] me that do these works so it's not man
[1:30:21] that's doing these works you see things
[1:30:22] happen at this camp meeting and God uses
[1:30:25] this brother here and this brother here
[1:30:26] and you know we got to the point where
[1:30:28] we get jealous over who God uses brother
[1:30:30] Brown makes a statement here he says you
[1:30:32] know what it's like a man with a
[1:30:33] football you know he's on your team and
[1:30:35] if he ain't in my church or he ain't my
[1:30:38] my assembly or this that or the other we
[1:30:40] want to run and grab the football out of
[1:30:41] his hand because he's running with and
[1:30:43] doing a great job and he said we're just
[1:30:45] we're so clumsy we stumble over a carpet
[1:30:47] with flowers on
[1:30:49] it I got a
[1:30:52] quote because it ain't my Church it
[1:30:54] ain't me it ain't my gift and we just
[1:30:56] get so carnal with the gifts that God
[1:30:58] choose to use God chooses you to use man
[1:31:01] man is God's agent he said instead of
[1:31:04] sitting there fighting against it put
[1:31:06] your shoulder to the wheel and get
[1:31:08] behind it take God that's who you're
[1:31:11] using we're going to amen it you want to
[1:31:13] use this brother amen God use him tear
[1:31:16] the devil's Kingdom down
[1:31:25] man has got a ball don't take it out of
[1:31:27] his hands he said try to guard
[1:31:30] him but instead of that because he don't
[1:31:33] belong to our organization we want to
[1:31:35] try to take it away from him oh come on
[1:31:38] Peter and John I got to close this out
[1:31:42] say look on
[1:31:44] us look on
[1:31:47] us Peter wasn't trying to make something
[1:31:49] of
[1:31:50] himself he wasn't trying to build his
[1:31:52] own kingdom he didn't had no church to
[1:31:53] take that
[1:31:54] too he said look on

[1:33:38] just received it wasn't just for him but
[1:33:43] he was so overtaken by the power of the
[1:33:45] holy spirit that he wanted to give it to
[1:33:47] somebody
[1:33:49] else he wanted to
[1:33:51] share this power this
[1:33:57] experience to share it with those on the

[1:34:38] have heard about the supernatural
[1:34:40] Miracles that Jesus did and after Jesus
[1:34:43] was crucified the Miracles were no
[1:34:46] more so they
[1:34:48] thought but one day this day was a
[1:34:52] different day than any other
[1:34:54] day this day he was going to be changed
[1:34:58] this day will be immortalized through
[1:35:00] the anals of the Bible the men and 2,000
[1:35:03] years later reading about it today this
[1:35:06] day was a set aart
[1:35:09] day oh brother Derek this day was the
[1:35:13] last day he would ever be put in
[1:35:16] place this day is the last service that
[1:35:20] he would ever had to beg again for his
[1:35:22] food he never had to beg for a job he
[1:35:26] never had to beg for
[1:35:28] healing this was the last
[1:35:30] day and all because two men not worried
[1:35:34] about their Kingdom not worried about
[1:35:36] their Ministry they just trying to get
[1:35:37] Christ out there to the people look on
[1:35:40] us Peter said Silver and Gold Have I
[1:35:44] None let me tell you Peter just went
[1:35:46] full time in the
[1:35:48] ministry he ain't had a whole lot of
[1:35:50] money he gave up fishing to preach this
[1:35:55] message he didn't have much to offer
[1:35:57] this guy and he knew that if he went and
[1:35:59] gave him a
[1:36:01] daeri oh he may get a porcel of bread
[1:36:03] for that day but he'd be right back in
[1:36:06] that same
[1:36:07] spot he'd be right back brother Tim
[1:36:09] begging
[1:36:11] again for the next meal to provide for
[1:36:14] his girls to provide for his children to
[1:36:16] get his wife a new
[1:36:18] outfit well Peter said and Silver and
[1:36:20] Gold Have I None oh I love this
[1:36:26] notice the man looked at Peter he gave
[1:36:30] the Bible says that he gave heed to them
[1:36:33] expecting he was going to receive
[1:36:34] something no doubt he began brother
[1:36:36] Johnny to reach his hand out oh these
[1:36:40] two guys they got it they
[1:36:42] loaded sometimes that's what we think
[1:36:44] about people don't we man they loaded we
[1:36:46] don't know what they going
[1:36:49] through Peter wasn't
[1:36:52] loaded with money but he was loaded with
[1:36:56] power he unpacked so he could be filled
[1:37:01] up Peter knew that that same power that
[1:37:04] he'd receive would be the same power
[1:37:07] that would raise that lame man to his
[1:37:10] feet and this day was going to be
[1:37:12] different this day was going to be
[1:37:16] lifechanging brother Bram said the
[1:37:18] church has got to lift itself up in the
[1:37:20] power of God we're too close to the end
[1:37:23] now and I believe the church is in a
[1:37:25] condition where we can teach a little
[1:37:27] deeper things and rub some of the make
[1:37:29] belief out and get into some real
[1:37:33] things hey can we tonight
[1:37:36] Church oh we love the soar in the
[1:37:39] heavenlies I love the word I like it I
[1:37:41] man look I took Eight Pages of notes

[1:38:54] the last days and we got a right to
[1:38:56] accept him that's right to bring his
