good to be back home to be with you again today and we just want to greet you in the wonderful name of the Lord have some tremendous meetings up in Canada as I spent two weekends there and and God blessed in a tremendous tremendous way out I thank God for being with us giving us traveling mercies I ministered up in Newfoundland there and for um the new pastor who's still the interim Brotherhood Jonathan curlette that's sister Lana butts's brother that is up there now in Newfoundland in St John's and so um you know God bless us in a great way gave us favor and I thank you for your prayers and then I flew over from there and visited with a church there it's their annual meeting um up in New Brunswick an old friend of mine I'm not near his age so don't equip me there he's 93 and still preaching twice a week and took 30 minutes of singing after I preached every service amen and don't intend to quit amen so that's brother Ivan Carr in the group there Amen in New Brunswick God bless them as we just had a wonderful time together worshiping the Lord together and speaking of the things pertaining to eternal life I heard from brother Ron Spencer uh after their prayer line last night in Edmonton Alberta and God just did marvelous things a lot of prodigals coming home and that's a sign of Jesus regarding amen praise the Lord Hallelujah amen we also we also have with us today brother Timothy Williams from Australia and also Judah Judah Pruitt and that's Joel and Trisha's little handsome red head boy back there Wednesday night he gave his heart to the Lord and made a surrender and and both of them want to be baptized today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you we're going to let you have your seats for a few minutes as I want to take a little bit of time to speak to you before we read the word and we're going to um just to share a few things today with you I want to thank brother Michael for helping me facilitate this and also for the brothers and and brother Michael got this done if you can y'all zoom in on this up here so that our unseen audience can see it too and this is just so beautiful the way that that it's done actually it was um when I went to Germany while we were building the church and saw something very similar to this it just um I I just realize that's what I wanted to go right there and so that's why it's there you know it's um something we can change every every service and update according to times and Seasons or even sermon contents or whatever else so you know um thank you brother Michael in all your name that is done with the hard work and you know they did that these screens here and on the side how many is happy about that amen praise the Lord amen you know God gave the word but great was the company that published it and so you know there's many many that given to the Lord and we're so thankful for what they do of their time of their Sweat Equity if you look around this this place and what we have it's all paid for but a lot of it was paid for with your sweat and I want to thank you amen every time I drive up here I say thank you Lord You're you've been so good to us you have blessed us you've showed us as Jehovah's Zyra the provider you've showed yourself as hell else have I more than enough amen and you know with this more than enough I I think as we have done you know in our hearts can has been a little different maybe in our aim toward others but actually when I when we finished um this church God not only abundantly blessed us and provided for us but also I was I was able to fit pews into brother Wendell Martin's church and Supply them if you ever go there and you think it looks like even like Tabernacle well we gave them all our pews just like ours and and so and then we gave them ten thousand dollars to help them build their building we've done that with with with more than nearly about 10 down through the years that we've done that with uh around the U.S and Canada helping them get started in their in their um in their church service we recently just done that with the church in Newfoundland that just was able to buy a facility and and uh it was formerly a Catholic church but now the original Catholics have it again amen so you know we we are we have been blessed and blessed abundantly and we thank the Lord for that and I I wanted to I was talking about that and the blessings of the lord we we're still supporting the Japanese work and I just want to assure you every dollar given as designated for Japan was given to the trustees and spent for that purpose still today I sinned I'm 500 each month to help them rent a building for their church services and this is actually their Sunday morning service this week um where that you know there was no churches in Japan so with the burden on our hearts actually others had went in and tried to do some seed work there brother Danny del mundo others you know from Philippines different other places had went there and had it done some things but this was this was done as a a very new work and I I believe that's for the FED over there on the left who is the pastor he's from the Philippines that is working there in Japan and so God was able to leave us with them with a shepherd and to commit them to a Shepherd day or an autonomous Church they are on their own we do not control them they're not under our thumb but we do try to help them and system where we can um you know I like I said I I send them a 500 every month to rent a building for their church services and this doesn't cover all the expense it just assists you know why I do that that way because I think it's important that the group uses some of its own resources and become as self-supportive as possible and you know I and I like this because if we can get Believers there then then it you know it's their job then to evangelize their country Amen brother Branham said a missionary is not a squatter he comes and goes and so you know you but you know we believe that we get a work started and and from there they go and spread the gospel to their community and to around the world and uh and also we took tithe money from that was given to us from a Christian man that was designated for the Japanese work and and um you know as I said if it's designated for that purpose that's where it goes the trustees handle it and I make sure it goes to the country it is intended far and it has helped support those that has gone to Japan to be able to get this work and you know they didn't know exactly how to do it when they started you know this printing some works and going out and trying to pass out tracks and things and meet him in the Subways or whatever train station and a lot of that didn't work so you know it became more one-on-one and um you know we we had uh we supported ministers like brother Timothy brother Craig Brewer brother Jonathan Martin and uh and other other ministers who go there um including brother Danny del mundo that we helped support work to go and and also teamwork that went from here um brother George Winters brother John lay and different ones that we helped support to go in that initial uh thrust and um you know we we have also continued to support the translation work to get this message into the Japanese language you know when we went in there there was not a single book in their language not a single sermon of brother branham's not a singing a single um thing that we could give them years ago they had tried to do the churches book secular people had in the translation work a few copies was printed but that that whole work was dropped and forgotten and nobody could even produce a copy over there so you know but um but now today there are close to 500 titles including the churches book and the Seven seal books that is in their language and it's all because of their efforts that that we have done from here and sending out and this is nothing short of miraculous one of the last couples that was reached there was um brother Emil and sister Ruth um you they have been here to our meetings we actually sponsored them to come over to be in one of our October meetings and them and their daughter was able to come and uh but this couple was very important I felt it was really important for them to to get a view of what it was like to be in a church where the spirit of God was moving and and that to be able to take that lick of fire back to Japan and you know these were this couple was when the last that was reached on one of our trips and uh while the brothers was there and by the Providence of god sister Ruth happened to be just happened to be just happened to be a translator by profession and so we we were able then to get her then to put the message into the Japanese language and and so and then you know as kobit struck the world for several years travel was prohibited to Japan and uh to buy to provide spiritual food since we couldn't go this money was spent to uh to put the message into the Japanese language now I'm just going to tell you it's a vital importance not just to tell them of Jesus and only just to fade back into sin and to the world but to found them in truth in present truth now brother Branham talked about that himself he said when I went to South Africa or to India and those places he said um you know many were there were many converts thirty thousand in one meeting you know that that Christ their idols and come to the Lord but he's and you're listening to take insides with Jesus he said they just faded right back out into the world or wherever they come from and he said you know what I've what should have happened was there to be Ministries go forth and start churches and and for them to get established in the in the truth well this is what we have tried to do is by getting a a seed Church you know then establish them in the truth get the message to them amen not just a denominational Jesus but the Jesus of the Bible amen and so the Bible tells you in second Peter 1 12 he said he said I would not be negligent to put you always remembers of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth now so how else can you establish them in the present truth except by giving them the true message that the apostles and the prophets preached and that's what our message is is not a new message it is the message in its original format serpent seed as a apostle Paul and John the Baptist and even Jesus himself and and all of them taught you know the predestination the security of the believer baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know the godhead and you know not a multiple deity but of many gods but the one true Living God so our burden is totally different from that of denominations they they present a Jesus of 2000 years ago we don't that Jesus has been modified by them by the denominations to fit the criteria of their beliefs and but we present a living God one who has spoken specifically to this generation and there is a message that is given by the resurrected Jesus Christ to the laodicean AIDS the AIDS we're living in to bring forth the Bride of people for his namesake that will be raptured and it is it is the most important thing we can do is get the message in their language now so you see this is more important than even me going over there preaching and holding campaigns across Japan because that would only last for in memory maybe for a few days maybe for a year or two and then would fade away but this when you can get this where you can put it in their language it will have an effect for years and years and years to come as God tarries now so you know again during covet you know the world was shut down the country of Japan was shut down for about two years and when it did open up they were requiring like three sets of vaccine and and uh and as soon as the doors was open you know uh we it was much easier for for someone else to travel there than uh that was close by so the Philippines was there this pastor right here comes from brother Danny del mundo does church and so he is very much connected with with this pastor in this group of people as we are and so we made it possible that brother Del Monte del Mondo and his wife would go and strengthen the Believers in the church there and Yokohama and also travel elsewhere in the country during that time we also channeled funds to brother Danny to rebuild Believers in the Philippines after a terrible typhoon their country and we we also helped him and to repair the ceilings of his church as the ceilings were falling in and his his church had some costly repairs so we were able to channel money to that um you know apart from that if there's is there so is that the only picture of that typhoon just go ahead and leave it on that one for now um we we also um sent contributions through time um for to Vision books that brother Barry Coffey is endeavoring to put sermon booklets of brother Branham and by Bibles and various languages and worldwide and I want you to know he's doing a tremendous work and I commend him for what he's doing now we didn't we haven't sent me some money I sent money that was given to me as tithing and and accepted it because tithing goes to the ministry I accepted it and then I sent it there to to help facilitate getting the message into different countries now today a team from Brother Jason Watkins church has left today going on a dangerous underground Mission work in Egypt and prior to their leaving um we helped them do a print job for the people in Egypt you know they meet there it's it's a crime to convert anybody into Christianity so you have that one of the translation books so uh you know we we have helped facilitate um sermons like the Easter seal the token the unveiling of God recognizing your day and his message why Christ speak does God change his mind a paradox invisible Union all in the Arabic language and this is going to to help um establish people there that are in underground Church is that are happening to meet in secret in other words that's what underground is not literally in the basement but maybe in the basement but still out of sight of the authorities and um so we have helped um you know facilitate this we're to get that printed this also goes like our Japanese um done work has done is put on the message Hub that way any Japanese person or arabic speaking person can go on the message Hub and download and print a sermon right there in their country You Don't Have To Cross borders you don't have to go through customs you don't have to do you know pay fees you know that they can do it in the privacy of their own home and and either read or print them out and distribute as they feel led so you know we so we have helped to do this we have also helped to do the same in the Farsi language we shall reach the Persian countries of of um and Persian speaking people like down in Iran and Iraq and different places like that that has went now you know you probably you probably don't realize this but um um I I just want to I just want to cover this while I'm here because next Sunday I I'd like to take a missionary offering to to support our missions as we go forth and this money again will go to missions and uh I may not be able to tell you exactly what where is going to go but I guarantee you every dollar of it will be spent for Mission projects and uh but you know and this is not missions but yet it is missions but your money won't go for this but you might not realize it but the Fiber Optic internet you know to support our streaming work our um to load it up on the uh on our website and so on it cost us about thirty five hundred dollars a year you're offering pay for that the offerings that you give and this helps not Mission offerings but your regular offering helps get the gospel to all the world to edify Believers around the world and that is also a mission work amen it really is because you know that this gospel must be preached into all the world and then the end shall come so this is one of the ways of reaching the world now so we're we're using as the Bible said travel will vastly increase you know so that's in the Book of Daniel where it speaks of that and so you know right now you don't realize it and um but that but we have right now listening in part of our service today brother attic Wilson and his family from South Africa then another part of South Africa hours and hours away brother Kalin Singh and the and uh perhaps some of his folks there listening in or watching the service right now as I'm speaking and and um that isn't because we are that I am so important but is that we we are doing all that we can to edify build up strengthen the body of Christ around the world and give them a balanced gospel now of course you know the um as as I as I said um then to do this not only do you have the internet but you also have the hosting for sermons on our website and the the streaming capabilities and that cost in the neighborhood of sixty five hundred dollars a year about five hundred dollars a month this is paid from again from the tithe given to me as a pastor and then I take I take it as a minister and put it back into the work of the Lord and this again is Mission work this is a total of ten thousand dollars each year to get the gospel out to the world just by these means and and if you look around the these cameras and whatever they were bought by the same means and even these new projectors not by your offerings but for the things that you entrusted to the ministry part and we as well we we support four um for ministers full-time in this church brother Joe Adams brother Aaron algo speed they are our evangelists that are going out from here we also send um 600 a month to to one of the evangelists that you know to help him pay his rent every month you know we we have had that kind of Burden not just to reach out to the world but also home missions and around the U.S and and Canada and so you know this is why we're doing this and also I just want to say that right here in our service today just to show you the effect um we have uh brother Timothy Williams from Australia will you stand brother Timothy amen he came to our our services this week he's looking for God Amen have you found him have you found the desire of your heart isn't that wonderful gonna be baptized today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now this is a face that you would never see but it's joined with us many times back here is a family here from Trinidad Brother David sister Carol and their daughter from from Trinidad where y'all stand amen they're they're part of that unseen host that many times are part of our services and they've just come to be here with us today amen now if you think we get lots of contributions from the world out there we actually get very little from outside sources to cover this part of the ministry and if you're listening in and you're blessed by the services they don't come for free you know you you might consider helping support the gospel to the world but in saying that I'm not asking for your tithe that belongs to your pastor to take from your local work but you want to give a mission offering or don't have a local home Church where your contributions would be spent as wisely as possible for the gospel of Christ now I also wanted to tell you not only do we do that but if you look here occasionally and I don't do this often just several times Through The Years um in Zambia we helped fund a a rough structure um in Zambia last year and uh so if you put your the picture from Zambia know that that's not Zambia that's uh there you go there's Zambia and it's a rough structure that we helped them a congregation do last year now this year we are finishing this with putting flooring doors windows and toilets and so on there as you can see it's still just a rough building yeah they use it just like that but you know they they ask and we had helped that much so I just thought well we might as well complete what we're doing so we've been we're finishing this putting Windows Doors toilets um flooring because you know they they were willing to to meet in there with dirt floors so God bless them they and they it's a struggling nation and and struggling people now as um as you know um and you might have heard there's a revival going on in Uganda and there's been a lot of new believers and again uh we have helped through the years to facilitate um translation works for the people in Uganda they got several different languages there that that we have helped facilitate and so we built and and I'm going back a few years but we built this church in in um for brother James Nevada Bondi uh back some years ago if you'll show that was that previous picture Michael uh right there and so you know we helped facilitate this because and we also supported translation and distribution of brother branham's message and uh and tracks and things like that to send out to the different languages there and and uh brother brother uh James uh he he at that time was supporting and I'm not certain all what he's doing right now now currently but and you know we actually helped him to print and translate many many sermons of brother branham's to go into the country of Uganda in several different languages and tracks and so on and then his church was just in shambles as a Shack in bad condition so we helped facilitate this and we we built him a nice Church there and then I you know knowing that he was doing this translation work and laboring for the gospel and and facilitating um and hosting um different translators that he would have to meet with then I uh built him this home right here where there there again is this is him standing in front of his home that that was built and this comes from a um from a brother who was living in a mud hut type with um they put sticks all around and and there was um you know manure and mud sightings as put on there that can be washed away during things uh during like um the torrential rains that they get there in Uganda and so on so um you know there there again we we tried to help because he's hosting ministers coming in and the trans works and for him and his family we helped do this so you know um together with brother Hilda Brown I worked together with him who was uh living of course at that time now you know um we we have plans this year coming up at the first of actually next year so we're making plans now uh brother Timothy Brother David Mayer of France they are going to the nation of Uganda to for special meetings there with um with a friend that I have been conversing with for probably the last seven to ten years and um and that's brother Buzz Bosey talamua um so if you'll bring up that photo of the committee there there they're making plans for a 2024 youth meetings in January or Brother David Mayer brother Timothy Pruitt will go they have a committee about 15 young people helping preparation so yeah there is still um Mission work that is going on and uh brother bozi um he's been instrumental in not only found in a church in Kampala Uganda but also founding a church in kawasa Ethiopia we have assisted him in translating printing books or booklets rather tracks and so on and you know things like helping him in evangelism putting tires on his car to go and preach the gospel in another nation and this man Works tirelessly for the gospel of Christ he make you ashamed you know when he went on his honeymoon he he took the money that was given to him and and him and his wife headed out for Ethiopia there to be able to preach the gospel and to share the the the the message and to help establish a church and right now because of his efforts there is a church there in kawasi uh Ethiopia and um there's also he has aspirations to go back because there's many other large cities in the millions that he wants to minister to and um you know I I wanted to get to know brother Buzz because I've written him many times and we've conversed back to the years so I actually paid for him and bought him a ticket to meet me in Germany where that brother Timothy and I could spend hours some hours together meet face to face talk about Mission Works and so on like that and so he met me there in um in Germany and we were able to discuss many things I got to know him on a personal level because the Bible said to know them that labor among you and so it's very very important so right now I'm going to go and bring Uganda to evening like Tabernacle and uh brother Michael has helped me facilitate this and we have here with us yeah yep here brother all right we have brother Buzz Bosey here and um it's uh he's going to greet you this morning God bless you brother brothers Bosey we love you amen you you have been a an inspiration to my heart I just want you to share with them your inspiration and again about 10 minutes to greet the people this morning amen amen God bless you so much brother Tim I really appreciate you and thank you for the invitation to uh good to say that evening we've uh over the years I presented your ministry and uh so I just wanted to give a little greeting and maybe speak a little bit about what we are doing here and and I I remember the first time I ever had of your ministry was at the meetings I witnessed 2007 that brother biscal uh hosted over in Canada and uh there I was really blessed uh with the method that you gave the dispensation of fullness of times I think that was the subject I was really so impacted by that and when I went to search on your Church website I noticed something that really moved me that you had started ministry at 15 years and this is exactly the age where when I started also ministering in the message having come from an Anglican Church back at Brown my father was a priest I started Living with uh with the bishop of our church um at 13 years and at that time the bishop wanted you know one day we were sitting on the dining table and he asked me uh can you preach and so I was very shocked because I did not expect that from from the bishop in the Anglican Church you have to go to theology for a few years be ordained as a as a minister to be able to stand on the pulpit but when he asked me that a little child of 13 years I was very shocked but that would be the first time that I ever stood before a few hundred people and and for two years I was with him and living in his house and ministering until later on the message I had the message when I was 15 years I was about to make 15 years and when I had the message for about six months I tried to wrestle with it it was not easy in coming because I had many aspirations I wanted to be a bishop in the Anglican Church I I wanted to be you know someone that would serve God and would tell people about about the Lord I had desire to live that kind of life you know of course being from a background where my father was a minister himself and so I knew that that would be the only thing that would bring me uh a closer to the Lord and to serve the people of God but literally did I know that God had other plans when he introduced the message to me and you know being that it's a few minutes I'll just give a little bit of that and you know um having ministered for two years 13 years 14 years when I became 15 then God introduces the message to me through a few people that I had come in contact with and I applied to wrestle with that but through a supernatural encounter the Lord made me while I was just there in our church in the Anglican church and you know I saw the children being baptized I saw a woman preaching I I had I sing the Apostles Creed I don't know how many people listening to me today know the apostles greed and so as I had that across the screen um I was moved by this by this line which said and I believe in the Holy Catholic church and I remember the brother his name was Paul who used to minister to me you said you were catholic and I would say no I'm Protestant I'm not Catholicism so that voice came again to me I said oh goodness I have never had this been spoken I did not know that this was part of our crew and so but right there while we were standing in our church something happened that I would say was an encounter with the Holy Spirit having had the message for about six months and my heart knew that it was the truth but something needed to happen for God to move in my heart for me to hold somebody accept the message and and you know as a wall of wind was just going around over my head I had a I had a sound and it was loud and clear as I'm speaking to you today and he spoke to me by name say talimar find the nearest exit and leave this place and it came about twice and then the third time I couldn't resist it I just picked up my Bible and swung myself out of the church after the Anglican church and that would be the very first last time I went into the Anglican church and then later on I would go to a message church that same day because apparently I was living with a family that our message Believers Minister it was a pastor in the message and so I I had to go there at that moment because I had nowhere to go and right there he ministers preaching his name was brother Paul is preaching and preaching like a man with coats of fire under his feet just like a bridge by the team and so this moved me and and I knew that what he was saying was the truth everything he was speaking about was exactly what I had left in my church and you know that same atmosphere came again and that one will come came over my head again and our voice came out of it and said stand up on your feet and lift up your hands and declare to everybody here that you have accepted this message and you would like to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and I try to resist it but I couldn't I just noticed that tears were coming down from my eyes and I just stood up and I was my whole body was shaking I don't know what was happening at that moment but I gave my heart to the Lord I was prayed over and they took and made to the river and baptized me in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ now when I came out of that water I decided and made up my my mind I was only 15 years but I made up my mind that I would tell the whole world about this entire message of course it was very strange at that time in our village in our place it was not widely known and you know all these things that were thought in the message he was not accustomed to them but I made up my mind I said if I'm going to live a life I'm going to live a life of telling others about this precious message praise the Lord and I just want to thank God because ever since then it's been 16 years and the only thing I've known is to Proclaim this message this message will be Aha and by what this Grace I've been married now for 10 years and five children and and you know the Lord moved in my heart yesterday before I got married and uh I I just you know receive the burden I was in um in Zimbabwe at the time and the Holy Spirit ministered to me about Ethiopia I did not know a few people I have never been to a fair paid sir uh but not it's um in the north the Northern parts of Uganda in little ways away so I had never been there and been from a Battleground that did not have very much I did not expect that I would ever go there but you see the Holy Spirit began to minister to me and um I contacted someone who was there and wouldn't have an open door and somebody told me that there was no message there there is no Believers in the country with European it's a country for almost 120 million people and so I thought I said if God is ministering to me about going to Ethiopians we must make a way somehow and this man put me to a test he asked me quite a few questions and said how old are you um when did you believe the message how long have you been preaching the message are you married and I I failed the test I can tell you I failed the test I could feel I failed at first and this man told me I'm sorry I can't overcome you here he was a [Music] foreigners in the country but then that took me into prayer and fasting I desire that God would do something that would sovereignly prove his will for us to build the country and it was them that I prayed I said God if it's a real may you then provide uh the resources for us to pray without having to ask nobody and also may you provide a contact I don't have to ask anybody for them to open the door to go for us to build the country and of course I wasn't married at the time but later on you know things happened and during the short time I cannot give you the whole story and testimony but what it suffice to say that um you know things happened and and the Lord provided the resources for us we needed quite a lot of money to go and at this time I was married and you know um maybe a few people have heard of that but the team dog came and grabbed me and my wife after the Lord had spoken to us and confirmed it by by a way of a vision that uh brother Tim would be coming down to do our wedding and and spoke to my pastor spoke to my father-in-law and my fiance and told them that the Lord has spoken to me about this but he has given me a sign and the sign has come to pass and this brother comes down and and he speaks to me he says where are you going to go for your wedding honeymoon I said by the team I'm not planning to go for a honeymoon anywhere because I don't have a enough resources to do that he said I have a proposal to make he said why don't you go to Ethiopia when you say the Ethiopia my heart shook because it had been three years earlier before this we have not spoken about these and he is proposing to me for us to go to Ethiopia it was then that I knew that and he said that well I I I'm gonna give you as my wedding gift for you to be able to accept me for your honeymoon and and God provided Sovereign [Music] for us to have a contact without us asking everybody and so by the team I was in my laptop like I am right now and they were trying to go through the Ethiopian Airlines website to book at our ticket I was with my wife seated by my side and we were going to book our ticket from an entebbe that is the airport in Uganda to borrow that is in Ethiopia and I received a call from someone I did not know previously he had never he had never met me I've never met him and he says you don't know me but I've seen your website I had put up a website called the youth message site because I wanted to use it to reach out to the people of the world about the message of the hour and so he said I've seen your website and I have a button to preach among Ethiopian people and right here in Nairobi we have a um some foreign people from Ethiopia where he has refugees and the Holy Spirit minister to me to go and minister to them and a few of them have believed but when I saw your website the Holy Spirit has implicit upon my heart to invite you to come and baptize them and I I was speechless I told this brother his name is um Justin I told him I said Justin you like you say you don't know me I don't know you but as I'm speaking to you I was trying to book a ticket to go to Ethiopia and this is an act of God and right away we are going to cancel our Ethiopian trip we're going to come to Nairobi fast and then from Nairobi we will go to Ethiopia so we landed in Nairobi met a few brothers that we knew and we met up with him also and he brought this Ethiopian man and brother tell me about place that Ethiopian man in the water and when he came out of the water he said I his name is Louisa he said I'd like to give you contacts for you to go and take this message to my people I want them to know about this message on the hour I I can't go back because I'm a refugee but I want you to go and take this message to them and so by God is Grace we went there and we called up this first man he came he's a priest one of he gave me two contacts one was a priest another one was his blood brother and the priest came and we had everything we had to say and he said whatever thing you said is the truth but I'm sorry I leave many people I just cannot I just cannot abandon them but please go on and preach this message to my country and so well we said well let's go the second contact the second contact came and um I I I I I I I his name is Paul kumasa and kumasa came in and he for about two three hours we tried to lay down the principles of the message for him and it gripped his heart we were just in our little room which gripped his heart he started crying he said this is the truth where has this truth been he said I'd like to be baptized right away and so we had to go out and look for water there was no water we just had together somewhere with a very huge bathtub and we've placed him by the name of all of Jesus Christ and that happened to be the first Ethiopian to be baptized in Ethiopia believing this message to come and for us to witness to them and so this woman comes and I felt that I needed to say this because it's very it this was how the method now is packed up from this moment of this woman us meeting this woman and when they told me when this brother was telling me about this woman he said you need to see this woman she will believe this message she'll stop by your food oh you need to see her so I was expecting you to see a saint but when this woman came she was dressed up like all of them who were in in plants and you know she had all the makeup and all the earrings and all the jewelry and you know when I looked at her my righteous indignation just rose up and shoot up and I said oh this is a jezebel she will not get it oh I was just biased and by the way it was that moment that God checked my attitude it was that moment that God opened up my mind to know that this message has power as long as it's laid down on the heart of a person they will receive if they are ordained to receive it and so this woman she looked at me and said as she [Music] look son I I was called by this man because I respect him and he told me that there is a missionary from Uganda and and and and because I was praying for the Lord to visit me I came because I know that you have a message for me so if you have anything to say say it the way it is if it is God's word I will receive it and at that moment my wife was in the bathroom I did not know that she was praying but I she like rebuked me I opened up my heart and I started sharing everything you know talk about Holiness talk about the message of the generation talk about baptism godhead and everything I just powered it all out to her and she started crying and and laughing at the same time she had mixed feelings and and she told me uh is this all is there more I continued sharing for another one hour my wife came out of the bathroom and said I saw in a vision someone a lady being baptized I said praise the Lord she must be this woman let us wait a moment and see what the Lord will do and this woman was in a few moments she had given up her heart and she said this is the truth I'd like to receive it and be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and she went out he looked for water we had no water anywhere in Addis Ababa the capital and so she came back later on she said I'm sorry I couldn't find the water but very early in the morning I'm coming back and so Saints I wanted to remember that this was our honeymoon myself and my wife so we were not very early in the morning before just before seven and this lady her name is Jordan she said I'm ready I'd like to be baptized and she came wrapped up in a very big gown you know and you know she told me that I borrowed it from somebody because she never had any address in Hawaii and so she gave our heart to the Lord with her God if it would help us in the work and and so the works popped out across the country and there are many other Supernatural testimonies really of what the Lord did we've seen God um uh a call and prostitutes prostitutes off the streets and they've been baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we've seen people where you know completely oppressed by the devil being delivered foreign and we love you and the people here have heard your message today of sharing what God has done amen will you give him a hand today and we're going with the service amen let's stand together there's a call comes ringing across some restless waves send the light oh send the light there's a call comes a ringing or the Restless way [Music] s [Music] foreign [Music] God [Music] you will do forever [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] for Life Let It Shine forever [Music] let's turn to Psalms chapter 42 for our scripture reading this morning all of that was free amen and I'm sure you were blessed by it and knowing the gospels going around the world and we have a responsibility to do our little part that's all we can do amen and we are doing our part Amen to get this gospel around the world and whatever means that God gives us what he puts in our hands we do it amen God bless you brother bozi that um and you and the Saints there and and let's turn to Psalms chapter 42 and verse 1 for our scripture reading this morning as the heart paneth after the water Brooks so paneth my soul after thee o God my soul thirst us for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy God when I remember these things I pour out my soul in me for I have gone with them had I gone with them altitude I went with them um to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holy day amen let's bow our heads father we love you we want to thank you for your blessings to us that you're a mighty God and that you are called a bride from around the world out of every out of every nation Kindred Tom tribun people and Lord we thank you o God that you have given us such a glorious message here in this end time and that we are part of of something that you are doing in this day as we find that last predestinated seed I pray that you'll bless ever effort of all of the work that is done around the world and oh God may it be used for your glory and Lord that you use us today Lord as we speak Words of Life May the joy of the Lord be our strength may you help us in these times Lord to stand in this evil day father I pray in the name of Jesus it should anoint the word as it goes forth now in Jesus name amen God bless you as you're seated I was sharing some things with some of the brothers during last week and something struck an accord in my heart that I want to speak upon this morning and I want to speak on thirsting for a living God and of course thirst is a painful desire that when you're really thirsty it hurts you know it's painful and of course we know what it is The Thirst naturally but there's also a spiritual thirst David said in Psalms 84 and 1 he said how amicable or how pleasant are thy Tabernacles oh lord of hosts my soul longest yea even famous for the courts of the Lord my heart and my flesh cryeth for the Living God and I believe that every man they thirst for God is a natural thing to thirst it's something that God placed within the heart of every man and David said here my soul I mean his very innermost being the soul desires and Longs and thirsts for our living God you know it's a control tower as it was that that is putting you by God to warn you that there is something that is needed that causes you to go out on a search you know to find that which is the answer for the longing of the soul and of course the same is true of a of a natural thirst long before you dehydrate because you can die of thirst there is a warning that goes off within your body and you begin to desire a hydration and and you say I'm thirsty I I need water I I need a drink and it'll even cause you to wake from a deep deep sleep and and cause you to get up and search I'm thirsty and the question comes to mind do all believers search or at thirst and I want to say certainly of all believers thirst but their thirst has been quenched and satisfied by almighty God they have found the Fountain of Living Water you know in Revelation 7 there's this multitude without number who come through to a Great Tribulation and and yet they're still thirsty because their thirst has not been quenched and the Bible says to them as they arrive there still thirsty you said in Revelation 7 16 they shall hunger no more neither thirst anymore neither shall the sunlight on them nor any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them into living Fountains of water and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes somehow they get to this other side even though even through Great Tribulation and and and they are still thirsty they still have a need to be led to Living Waters now there is a natural thirst in every human being whether he's a sinner whether he's a saint every person thirst you are born with a desire or thirst for God you were made to desire God now you take animals animals don't desire God but humans do you never see an animal making a a statue or creating an idol uh to worship our building houses of worship there's no form of worship that you see in an animal that that is actively trying to worship something but man wants to worship something you read in the Old Testament in Jeremiah 10 where we instructed not to learn the way of the Heathen or who takes an ax and cuts down a tree and makes them out of it an object of worship with the work of his own hands and that man will try to carve something out of that wood and then deck it with gold or silver and dress it up and after working and making his hand to turn around and and bow down to worship it a a senseless Idol that has to be carried about it that are dumb that cannot speak Idols that you can pray to that will never answer but why does man do this because man is always hungered and thirsted after God he was made to do that because man has a soul and so he was made to desire to want to know his creator every person everybody every human being has a thirst for God again in the in the message thirst brother Bradham talks about it he said I've had people tell me well I never did I never thirsted for God I just believe it's for somebody some just some people that want to be Christian oh no that's wrong it is actually something that is associated with every human being and he said when we come to this country in the early days we found the Indians here and the Indians though Heathen at the time they worship the son or something as long as they're human there's something in them a natural thirst calling out to God somewhere amen now you know man wants to live and he thirsts so he looks for ways to enjoy life to his fullness and brother Branham told us about this and then Tyson's Foods he said I don't even condemn The Sinner or the drunkard for getting drunk he's all Moody he don't know he gets up in the morning he's got the blues he has a hangover he goes out gets three or four bottles of beers and a stuffed a little cigarette sucker sets back and smokes and blow it through his nose like he was a freight train I don't blame him that's all the joy he knows that's all he knows about he's a pig by nature but he said shame on you who professed to be a Christian and rely on such things as that for Joy when the Holy Ghost Gospel is nothing but one great big Powerhouse of Joy amen the Holy Ghost uh the gospel is a perfect intoxication for every man that's got the blues you'll take a drink of the Gospel of Jesus Christ be filled with the Holy Ghost you are drunk till you leave this world amen joy unspeakable and full of Glory there's a constant stimulation it's a constant intoxication drop day and night amen that's the word of God amen now all men thirst for God but they'll try to satisfy it on things of the world their nature though is sin nature and like a pig that Waller in the muck and the mire and the Stick Of The World but when you've not had a nature change the man's up all night playing his video games pretending to murder to kill to rape to pillage don't don't you know that's only trying to satisfy a a a beast nature and the Holy Ghost doesn't get in enjoyment out of feeding on the Imagine feeding the imagination on things that are evil and then because then you know the family is neglected the wife is neglected not giving her two benevolence the children are neglected the Bible is not fed upon because you're too busy feeding the animal the Beast but of course he's a sinner his and his dope his uh his tobacco his video games his movies that's his pleasure but this if the soul ever gets that satisfying portion of the spirit of God the soul belong and desire for the Living God amen and whether they know it or not that you know even though they're trying to satisfy it with these vices of the world this dope this alcohol a whoring or or doing all the other kind of sin it's really a misplaced it's really a misplaced substitute trying to quench The Thirst that is in that heart for God if they can never come in contact with Christ they would find that they would have so much joy in Christ I mean those things would be deader than midnight to them they would become addicted to the word of God they would become drunk on the Holy Ghost and it to them it would be joy unspeakable and full of Glory a man when he comes home under pressure of his job he'll feel the need to smoke or you know that calms his nerves or he thinks or you know he needs a feels the need of wine to relax him or feels the need to party that's his release he wants his pleasure you see the thing for you to do as a Christian today is to live such a Godly life before him that you can prove to him that the gospel holds 10 000 more more pleasure that what that ever will be amen If he if that man dies in that state he'll go to hell on his liquor that's the devil's intoxication if he dies dragging on that old pipe or That Dope he you know God is his judge if they're not going out here dancing and running around in Memorial clothes again God's our judge they'll wind up at the judgment but there's one thing that's different for you amen there's one thing if you die under the anointing of the Holy Ghost like Stephen did when he looked up in the face of God and said I see the heavens open and I see Jesus standing at the right hand brother you're Heaven bound Hallelujah now Jesus invites whosoever will to come to me and drink drink that's quenching their thirst and he said they will never thirst again you know what a promise that that it is that he can be the answer to the the sole desire and my but you know the devil will make other ways to for you to try to quench your thirst sometimes it's a religious thirst you know I I'll just go to church and I'll join a church and I'll join a group of people who I think is right and then you wind up with as much hypocrisy in your life or sometimes worse than going to the ballroom to quench your thirst in the wilderness places of Israel where we read of David speaking of the deer the heart they had wolves and they had wild dogs that would attack the deer because they were an easy prey to them and I don't need to say to you you were that deer chased by the hounds of hell and if you're outside of Christ this morning the devil's on your Trail let me tell you demons that swore they would destroy you amen and of course you know you're running every man is running but you're running into a death trap you're running into total exhaustion until the hounds are gonna get you forever Center the hounds of Hell or on your Trail and they're yapping they're yapping at you amen I I was there in the in a place here just recently where um during the night during the night you know demons actually came into my room and they were they were screaming and threatening and yelling and trying to as if you know trying to give it get at me well I tell you what I did honestly I needed some sleep and they were disturbing me so I just say I just I just sat up in bed and I said okay you Devils now you go in the name of Jesus Christ I'm going to sleep and I turned over and went to sleep but you see there was a man there in those meetings that was having those same demons that was come screaming at him and service after or not service that's servant but day after day they were tormenting him and coming to him just like the eye experiencing and they were coming tormenting him and there in the presence of God Amen there is we we laid hands on him and prayed with him every one of those demons left and he found peace Hallelujah but you see ever for every sinner the hounds of hell are on your Trail they're on your Trail they're yapping they won't let you sleep at night your back becomes so hard your pillow hard you can't sleep and you can't rest because there's no place you can find peace and you hear them coming on your Trail the hounds of hell maybe sometimes it isn't even something you hear they're just sneaking up in the shadows and they're ready to pounce out upon you any moment Because You're vulnerable and I want to say today without outside of Christ you are vulnerable without the Holy Ghost you are vulnerable amen but these dears would be attacked by the Wolves because they're an easy prey and without the Holy Ghost you are an easy prey you can promise I'll be moral I'll make my vows I'll turn a new Leaf it'll never work amen you only make your vows and your promises to break them again because your adversary the devil is on your track he's on your Trail and he's after you and he's there in the shadows or over the next Hill around the next curve he's there everywhere you look yeah this deer right here at this water book he's constantly having to lift his head and look around he's nervous any moment there he's to pray brother Branham tells us thirsting for life he said is a good type of the devil you take a beautiful woman or a handsome young man that's a very that's a very pray for the sins of this world just to pray a little innocent boy of 16 or 17 her little girl just to pray to the devil to Feast on these wild dogs will lay in ambush it's like in the days when you know with Cain and Abel and and he says to him to Cain don't you know if you do do well he says you'll be accepted but if not sin is crouching at your door and send crouches in every man's door just waiting for that opportune time they'll take and jump on these little deer the first thing they'll do is try to maybe to get this hamstring behind the leg where they can't run and hamstring them if you can't grab them there he grabs them at the throat and the and and try to jugular vein loose and it bleeds to death in just a moment then there's another place is the flank of the deer and he'll hit him there in the flank run and Chuck his teeth to that if he's a heavy dog and you know he'll fling that little deer around you know and and there they were dog piling you see one devil will invite another devil yeah amen you think oh I'm just gonna live my life and you know it's just a little devil that I deal with no he will invite others and they'll go pile you and they'll pull you right down into the snares of the death and destroy your life destroy your family he's a thief and he comes to Rob and to kill and destroy this dog will grab it but maybe if it's a mid-century even he'll swing the deer off his feet and they just go and carry the little fella to death let me tell you the devil's not your friend he don't do anything to you but destroy you what does Sin have to offer it only offers a broken home a ruined children and when you get down to the end of the road you might have built Mansions you might be a great person in this life but really what does that have to offer you in the other place one day you're coming down to the end of all and I want to say the end is closer than what you think because the Rapture is Promised for the Saints and wrathin will be poured out upon the Earth I know you know you've been preaching you've been preaching like this for many years and yeah the other day I stood right there before Kenneth Middleton what we were the Lord had come for him let me tell you he'll come for you you got to be ready he's come for many he could come for you for the services out but here many times that the dog will grab or the wolf will grab him mouth some flesh and pull it out if the if the deer is quick if he can maneuver his body quick enough sometimes he can get away and then then of course you know when the as he gets away from him the dogs are rolling from their momentum and he runs and whatever but he's wounded he's wounded and he knows he's glad to find water well I'll tell you you won't be in this world of sin very long without being wounded amen you won't be back here very long without being defiled by sin and brought down into debts that you never imagined you can say well I'll tell you what not me I'm going to be a model citizen I just won't give my life to Christ you want you have no protection you're resolved in your willpower and your diseases will not keep you you're not strong enough for the devil come on amen but here you become wounded like this deer and you can imagine this deer the blood is running out of him and he's looking now for the water Brook if you can just get the water I can live and that's what I'm saying to ever wounded soul today if you can only get to the water if you could only get to that fountain of Living Water you can live but if you don't get to the water you're going to die the hounds are on your Trail sometimes when a deer is wounded it's so bad he'll never make it in the water he's just there sometimes he'll fall in the water and he's too badly wounded but sometimes they're wounded and would die from the wombs but to get in that water and in that water they drink and they drink across the Little Creek drink run down the creek a little bit run up the hill cross back get some water if you can just keep on running as long as he can get water but if he doesn't get the water he's going to perish this is what David said my soul is thirsting after you oh God I I must have God or perish you know David discovered something here he he discovered that no matter how much resolved he had and how much determination to be a good man and a good king and a godly man he had all of this determination resolve I'm gonna do this I'm going to live right I'll tell you what I'll do I'll put the word instructors before my eyes I'll tie them to my fingers I'll tell you what you know I'll put I'll hold these promises but I'll tell you what even though he had 500 wives 500 women could not satisfy his thirst he had to go and take somebody else's wife David found out all his pledges and Promises could not hold him I can get you to sign cards I'll be true to my wife I mean battle in front of the Altar and say you know I'm going to be true to you till death do us part and you mean it but the only way you're going to be able to keep that is to get The Thirst that is in your soul satisfied or else you will always be reaching out trying to satisfy it and the sinful world that has been bit by The Mad Dogs of hell with all his modern Jazz and rock and rap music and dirty television programs and everything cracking their jokes they've been knocked on bit they're trying to quench that thirst with this stagnated water of the devil but I tell you I pray today if any is in that condition today may your soul your heart become so thirsty that you find Christ or die and it becomes your passion Lord give me that water I must not fail to get it and bound I'll tell you what if you can ever get to that water as a deer thirst for the water Brooks and you just get a drink from there do you know you'll never have to have another sermon on morals you'll never have to have another sermon preached to you on how to dress or how to act or how to conduct yourself no because your thirst has been satisfied and you'll never give up Christ for that [Applause] what makes a man or woman do wrong what makes him drink and carry on is because there's something in them thirsting something in her thirsting they're trying to quits that Holy thirst with the things of the world when only God can satisfy that that's the reason you thirst for something anyway because God made you you know your body made you to that way so you turn your holy thirst to him see but when you try to quench your thirst with other teeth I dare anybody to do that you have no right to to try and quench that Holy thirst that you thirst for something and you turn into the world and then try to satisfy it with the world you you can't do that there's only one thing that will feel that void and that's God and he made you to thirst sometimes we look at as Christians you know we look at people who've done awful sins and we say oh my what an awful person really if we could look at it and see that it's a Thurston human being this is what brother Buzz was saying a moment ago you know I met this woman and I was told she had a hunger she was on a search for God I was looking to see a holy woman but I saw someone dressed like a harlot I saw someone who was who who had not found that satisfying portion and yet you see you see you would have thought it would be the model Christian the model man the model the model a leader out here but no God chooses the harlots the fornicators the idolaters and the adulterers because they are thirsted because they are thirsty for God they try to fill it up with alcohol or tobacco dope or women or men all kinds of other vices but it's because there's a hunger a thirst on the inside of them but they're trying to fill it with other things just remember he didn't come to call the righteous to repentance he come to he come to call The Sinner in the ungodly that whom he came to save the Bible said he came to say that which was lost and the first thing before you can be saved is real I went lost I need Jesus and to be helped I've tried religion I've tried this I've tried Reformation I I've tried I tried to be reformed I've tried to well you know make vows I turned a new Leaf over on New Year's I did this and nothing works but Isaiah 55 1 said ho everyone that thirst says in other words he's calling out like he's like stop echoing the touches stop and he that hath no money come and buy and eat come and buy wine and milk without money or price wherefore you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which is satisfied not you tried this and you tried that but it don't satisfy hey my heart can diligently unto me and eat that which is good and let your soul Delight in its fatness and climb you ear and come unto me and here and your soul shall live and I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you oh even the sure mercies of David what an opportunity here the word is calling out actually from every scripture you know sometimes you say well I wish that God would speak to me or just look in the Bible I wish he would talk to me well how many promises do you have to have amen well I wish he cared for me I got told the story of brother Kenneth had his memorial service of God speaking to me to tell him I love you he said well brother Tim I wish God loved me well he came all the way down from heaven because of you amen he came to seek you out he sends his holy spirit to find you he deals and knocks at your door to find you amen God select you that he gave his only begotten son amen let me tell you this is the yeses to the world but friends it's also personally to you because of your sin and because he knew you were thirsty he was a thirst quencher and I want to say of him that no one ever cares for you like Jesus your alcohol don't care for you you're dope don't care for you your friends out in the world they will abandon you in a moment amen but there is one a friend that'll stick closer than a brother and said I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you I won't abandon you I'll be there when you fall I'll lift you up again no one's ever cared for you like Jesus well I just don't believe can't believe that Jesus would save me I've done so much I I've said so many things wrong well I'll tell you what you can sure believe that the devil has sent you to hell you know you can sure believe that the life that you're living is destroying you well why don't you just turn that around and believe in God something good amen if you can have faith the devil is is there you know to to destroy you why don't you believe there's a God who will save you amen the God who cares now there's so many entertaining things of our day and it's there to entice people and this is the truth I'm actually reading that from a quote from without money or price but let me just say this is the truth there's so many things to entice people more than any other age there's movies and videos and gamings and every kind of of social media that's porn at your fingertips everything else to what we call pleasures for all people in all ages there's enticements for these young people the modern dances the rock and roll parties and and I want to just say even to you parents out there or you know with the with the internet and things like that with your kids don't you realize there's a a devil lurking behind almost every website to try to grab them and wound them and pull them down there's enticement the modern dances rock and roll parties a wrap the music that they got to go with it all in Tyson entertainment and I just want to say Christian if there was ever time that you need to read your Bible is now you're thirsting for God don't try to satisfy it out here look to the Living God and I want to I want to say oh yeah I I don't think it's really enticing it is enticing it'll crawl to your soul it wants to destroy you you think ah you know somebody said to me oh brother Tim country and western music it's really good it's it sues me said um this guy was supposed to be a Christian and he said this excuse me it's about life how it really is and I said not my life not my life amen that's not how my life is my tears and my beer and my wife have gone on and and my kid's been raised by another man and all uh the sorrows and the troubles and whatever that they're singing about as they glorifies him and it's racist and they commiserate together one time I you know ever some years ago and they was talking about this hidden stuff if you play uh your your tape backwards on rock and roll you'd hear you know subliminal stuff that's in their backwards I said well I don't know I never listen to rock and roll never played One backwards didn't play one forward much less backward so I said I I don't know what's there but I said I wish they'd play country music backwards amen man would get his wife back you'd get out of the bar room and quit drinking he'd be a daddy to his kids come on there wouldn't be any divorces that'd be happy homes I wish they would play that backwards well I tell you that's what the gospel does it takes your rugged ratchet life and it turns it around and it restores you and brings back the holy ghost in your life with a holy think of the Holy attitude but what Satan wants to do to you is take you where your little children are ragged your little wife is broken your home is torn apart it's what he wants to do to you it glorifies sin the rap why I can't even do it the rap gets where you want to just shake your way down to Hell jerking and pulling and every step of the way all the way down into hell trying to numb your conscience oh brother Tim that don't affect our kids brother Brandon said I don't care how good a home a child has been brought up in and how it's been taught to do right if that child hasn't accepted the experience of the new birth rock and roll music catches his attention just as quick as he hears it because it's in him it's born in him by Nature a carnal Spirit and the power the devil is so great today till it catches the spirit of that little one and then he said how much more the old that is rejected to New Birth because only as your life has changed and you've been converted and Born Again Anew in the kingdom of God your nature will still be of the things of the world no matter how religious you are unless that's been changed in you you can worship and be religious and still and still that will have some kind of drawing power to you because the old man of sin and his desires is not dead yet but just let Christ one time take the Throne of your heart those things don't bother you anymore amen because it's so much greater and I just want to say to the wounded to the broken to the weary to the turn my sin that is chased by the hounds of hell that there is a fountain a Fountain of Living Water that will shield the broken the wounded the torn the bleeding I know I've drank from that Fountain and so have many here today this deer is always alert watching listening for Russell for crackling of the leaves King let us guard down for a moment brother Branham said that compare comparing the deer with the man thirsting for God there's something about a child of God that when you're born in the spirit receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's something about that person that can sense the enemy you can take a mountain when he's taking the scripture and reading the scripture and then tries to inject something that scripture that's contrary to to the scripture a man filled with the Holy Ghost can sense that right quick there's something out of the way when he gets into a place and that certain little sense in there it's done to protect your life you must never go for anything except it's exactly with the word and and because we're secured with that sense as long as we're in the Holy Spirit and brother random gave examples like that he said you can go for existence somebody said well I read that I I go read in Mark 16 these signs and follow them that believe in my name they said cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues or take up serpents or drink deadly things it would not harm them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover and then you find a person get up there and say now that was for the apostolic age that right quick if you receive the Holy Spirit you've been endowed with that sense it sets out there's something wrong there they try to explain it away that it's for another day that really you don't need those things today but Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe so there's something in there that sets off in you a little better than knowing that's wrong and it's a way of death Hallelujah I'm glad to have that kind of buzzer on the inside remember when you hear things like that that Christ isn't the same that the Holy Ghost still isn't real that we don't believe in prayer lines anymore or altar calls it all of that's in the past that's a blesser goes off a warning goes off amen you know that you're about to be leapt upon and drive you there into the snare of the devil and God puts a warning on the inside of you gout yes brother Branham said in the Third Exodus he spoke about Joseph's brothers who thought that they would never need that old dreamer brother of theirs they wanted to get they wanted to get rid of the gifts and that's the reason of it now he said they thought they'd never have a need of it we don't need speaker with tongues we don't need interpreters in tongues we don't need the the Old Testament prophets to set us in order by the Holy Spirit we understand that they have abducted a man-made system to take the place of the Holy Spirit therefore there's a people that's elected amen the hazard names of the Lamb's Book of Life they can't go for that their spiritual minded and therefore they can't go for that they can't stand it no matter if their fathers and mothers was lived in that whatever organizational Church you know I nobody has a right to add to this word or take from it what we've seen God do in the prophets Ministry we ought to know is real and it's for us today a man that not one scripture should we part from we should take it the way it's written for God watches over his word you believe that amen see he said no matter what the church would say what anybody else would say if you're born of the spirit of God you become a part of the Bible you see because you become the word as you receive the word as God told Ezekiel the prophet take the scroll and eat it then the prophet in the scroll became a part of each other brother I can't deny Mark 16 it is who I am I can't this I cannot deny Divine Healing it is who I am amen I cannot deny the miraculous the Living God that's who I am amen I have taken of this word and when someone tries to separate you from that a little buzzer goes off right quick to warn you death is on the road amen but I'm going to tell you the elect will not be deceived because the holy spirit is on the inside there to warn them amen that's why you heard some of you even recently heard the word saying come out of her my people amen that you not be partakers of that see what is the devil trying to do to trap you and to keep you from your freedom where you're giving this old stagnated water from a polluted stream to pin you up in some organizational Doctrine nicolete and spirit to Overlord over you and hold you in a pen until the day of Slaughter and the church has become perverted until it's a lodge a Place full of every unclean and hateful bird unchanged sinful people who are trying to fill a religious Thirst by dutifully going to church and there they get their coffee and donuts and a feel-good sermonette from a preacherette church is a place where people come together and worship God in spirit and in truth now some only want truth and no spirit and that makes the church only a lodge where the word is perverted and reduced to an intellectual gospel then the church becomes stagnant it becomes a cesspool where you can't even find Faith anymore well there's no living God or his miracles there's no healing of the body and no healing or salvation for the soul just an intellectual acknowledgment of Doctrine without life and unfortunately that's what has happened in many messaged churches the Bible said in Jeremiah chapter 2 verse 13 for my people are committed to evils they have forsaken me here's the evil they've forsaken me hey man you you think oh I we didn't we didn't turn away his gifts we didn't turn away his miracles we didn't turn away uh the the Holy Ghost is given the Apostle we hadn't we hadn't we hadn't turned that away no you forsook him when you did that you forsook him and then he said to healed out cisterns broken sisters that can hold no water and so even if there is a Revival comes by once in a while they can't hold it Church goes right back to the slump it was in you see say that Satan will lead you to come to his cesspools of unbelief people are hungry and if they don't find Food they'll eat from a garbage can how many are trapped in churches where the word of God is not living but just a dead Creed something that you profess to believe you know and in itself the word creed is not bad it just means I believe it's what we believe this is what we believe but you see if the life of the Holy Spirit isn't in you it's just a dead Creed and it may be the exact truth you see there's no reason for that when you're thirsting for God because God's a living God he's not a historical something as David said my soul searches after thee the Living God something that gives Living Waters something that satisfies The Thirst of the soul is something that all Humanity has in common man made to thirst after him so that no one would have an excuse that no one could say but God I never thirsted and God has said yeah you thirsty for me but you satisfied it with other things you took substitutes that the devil offered in and all staff needed water or even the gospel of an age past and did not stay in the present truth brother Branham asked this question he said why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal they send this secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job your wife your husband your children you let the cares of the world you let some Pastor you let somebody else get it out of you when you know way down in your heart you're thirsting you're hungering is God trying to reveal to you see the Revelation what revelation the revelation of Christ personally to you now you might try to quench that desire with other things so it could be your spouse it could be your car it could be some possession could be your job it could be Church joining it could be belonging to the society or the community of Believers and yet sit there and never drink from that fountain belonging to or associating with a good group of people that is not the satisfaction it's to find God the Living God the god of Heaven and inviting him into your soul because only that will satisfy that longing that thirsting that you're longing for there's a genuine need and a thirst for Christian Fellowship absolutely that's good we like to be with one another we have things in common because we're all thirsting for God you know there's something that that should be in common with everyone that has come in this building today is is we all have the same thing a common desire a thirst embarrassed I want to see the Living God I want to see him in his power I want to see him in his glory I don't have me a historical God a god of history but I'll bring him out of history and bringing present tense the Bible said in first John 1 and 7 but if you walk in the light is he is the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ of his son cleanses us from all sin sometimes a deer like this one will be out there by himself you wander off himself all alone that's always dangerous I tell you that's always dangerous you see you see there he's got two eyes two ears but if you had a companion he'd have four eyes and four years if he had six around him that would be more they're all watching listening warning and brother Bradham said that deer will wander off to himself that's a real place to get one he said that's why I think sometimes God's Little Deer sometimes wander off from the fold they might be some here tonight that's wandered away from the protection of the church from the protection of loved ones who pray for you and help you to come back to God to keep you straight to come to church and listen the gospel there may be some in radio land that's wandered away but this little deer wanting to wander out from the plot where she had protection away from the church where she gets in the Holy Spirit through the preaching of the word we're washed to the water of the word and then you get away and start staying home from church watching television all with tonight or when you go to prayer meetings going on and you're on your he said you're on your road when you've got prayer meetings going on then right then you're you're on your road out when your desires have become more to see some television program than it is to hear the gospel there's something wrong in the soul God Made You So you thirst for it now part of that thirst is even fulfilled in fellowship and with his children The Book of Proverbs speaks of fools or stupid people stupid people itself refuse to turn away from evil said keep company with the wise and you'll become wise you know like brother Kenneth told his family keep coming to church if you ain't going to church start and if you're in church state that was instructions of a man as he would leave for Glory and so you know keep company the Bible said with the wise and you become wise and you make friends with stupid people you'll will be ruined Trouble Follows Sinners everywhere that's why you don't want to you know keep a lot of company with Sinners oh Jesus did yeah he did to bring them out he didn't do it to play their games and to live their lives and to party with them somebody help me preach now he did them to show them the way of life the Trouble Follows Sinners everywhere so why do you want to be in their Calamity and their trouble because their trouble will bring trouble on you righteous people will be rewarded with good things so for the righteous good things follow I want to be among people where good things are happening I mean I want my friends to be friends where good things are happening what God is moving where prayers are being answered amen where lives are changed we're we're a Godly instruction comes be careful Who Your Friends Are brother Brandon was asked what kind of activities our kids could have he said keep them in Christian company he didn't say well you can you can rent the skate ring or you can do this and you can do that and I'll give you some other things you can do and yeah you can play UNO but not whatever the mother cards are I never played them but anyway you can play this but you can't play that and he didn't say he said keep them in Christian company be careful Who Your Friends Are you say well it's my brother it's my sister it's my Kinfolk they ain't your friends if they're not leading you to righteousness if you see the rewards of their life is evil they are not your friends amen now so you see the Bible tells you in Second Corinthians 6 14 be you not eat clear unequally yoked together with believe unbelievers for what Fellowship what Fellowship have righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion of light with darkness and what Concord or Harmony hath Christ with billion or what part has ye that believeth with an infidel and that's not just an atheist that's someone who adheres to a different religion if you think of John 737 you can put that scripture up for me please the Bible speaks of these in his promise he said in the last day that great day of the feast I believe we're there I believe this is the last Church ages that this is the last outpouring of the spirit amen amen this is the last of the last listen if this message don't turn your heart back to the faith Ain't Nothing Gonna Do It amen there's no eight day messenger nobody else ain't nothing ever going to get come and really turn your heart if this message don't do it you're not going in the rapture sorry God sent a message in this day in the last great day of the feast and this is where we are this is where we come what a wonderful feast I say what a wonderful feast amen it's a seven course menu did you know the Seven Seals are open amen the Thunders have spoken that which was sealed up has now been revealed do you do you know the book is not closed anymore and we're not preaching from a closed book and probing and wondering what it says but we have the gospel restored as it was in the days of Paul that's why this message is so vital that's why we're not go out to try to give you a Baptist Jesus or Methodist Jesus or you know just pass you a Bible and say hey read this and make it God sent a message in this day specifically designed to turn the hearts of their children back to the faith of the fathers or else he would just have to Smite the whole earth with a curse but in the last day Jesus stood and cried now he's not weeping he's shouting some people say well Jesus he was quiet when he gave the sermon sometimes he did sometimes the Bible said his voice wasn't heard in the streets but there was other times that he shouted you see he was a type of us all there are some that are that are equipped and they're ministered and maybe they they they bring it in a way and it's quiet and and it's soft and and whatever else that Jesus would speak that time waste sometimes and teach the Beatitudes and whatever but there's sometimes he preached and when he did he shouted If any man thirst I'm the fountain let him come to me and Frank I've got the water I've got the satisfied portion of God what you're Desiring I got what you won't find in the denominations of the day the Pharisees the Sadducees the herodians the scribes he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly or his innermost being shall flow rivers of Living Water so think about it friends you know you you get it as he said this speaking of the spirit that that they would believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given for Jesus was not yet glorified but you see here he said the Holy Ghost when he comes it'll be a fountain Hallelujah fountain down on the inside and it'll gush for us amen into eternal life now the Holy Ghost couldn't come back on man until Jesus was crucified diet buried rose again ascended of the glory because Jesus was the fullness of God in a body and he sent the Holy Ghost the spirit of God back but he's already preaching at times he's already preaching it and I want to tell you different from them it's already afforded you today amen he that will believe on me that's the scripture has said then out of his animals being shall flow rivers of Living Water you know not as the church said not as a message believer sages resided Creed and say I've joined the church and I believe serpent scene predestination I believe God's in the prophet in that sin it's more than believing you know again I I want to commend you for believing if you believed on the Lord I commend you that's a good place to start he that cometh the God Must Believe that he is then he'll reward you that diligently seek him but that's only the beginnings that's not even the Holy Ghost yet the Holy Ghost is drawing you and pulling you and wooing you but in Acts chapter 8 it was Philip who went to Samaria and he preached Christ to them and they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ and they were even baptized so they believed and were baptized both men and women not only that but there was a mountain there Simon a sorcerer himself believed and he too was baptized now the Bible said Simon a sorcerer believed it was still a sorcerer you said well I believe the message yeah it's still a devil worshiper I believe God sent a prophet still live in a dirty life I believe the message brother Tim ah you know that's as far as most message preachers will take you anymore just believe and get baptized just believe and get back oh you you accepted serpently you can see that your predestinated seek glory to God you're going to heaven you're in the rapture Simon tried to buy the Holy Ghost with money and this man who believed and was baptized was called out by Peter and he said thou has neither pardon nor a lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of God but he had believed it might baptized and Peter said back to your heart ain't right so don't just come that far I believe and accept the message and God's inner the prophet and get baptized you got to go all the way you can't stop if that's as far as you go and I commend you but you're just Simon the sorcery yet you can do that and still be a devil worshiper still living devices and there's many of them that does it on a message pew I'm not preaching the Baptist I'm not preaching the Presbyterians I'm preaching to you I do want them to be in heaven but I want you in a rapture and I'm not preaching for you just to barely make it by the skin of your teeth and wind up in the wack throwing judgment and finally led into eternal life and finally get the living water and finally quit there's I'm telling you there is something right now that you can get that satisfied person amen that will seal sin out of your life and seal the Holy Ghost into you and make you ready for a rapture I see in you he said are Galla bitterness full of bitter jealousy and the bond of iniquity and her hell kept it by sin that's as far as many goals and they become jealous next thing you know this is where trouble comes in the church because still sin is there and bitter jealousies rise up and envy and strife hatred this is where Judas has come up and show their colors because he stopped short of Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the problem with many they believed and they've been baptized but they're still held captive by sin the scripture is there have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed you can believe but have you received this is the question you see ah and and I can tell you how you can know whether you've received or not because if you have received it out of your innermost being flows River of living wire glassing up out of the into eternal life no more no more will I have to go as a pastor and pull you out of sin say come back to church try to do right do better this time no more it'll be there a living fountain of blessing stream the continually cleans the soul purges out the trash it won't be me standing there keep the law keep the scripture keep the word keep the promises don't do this and don't do that it'll be the Holy Ghost on the inside of you and there he will gush up and blow the trash out in trials and tests and temptations it's still going to Bubble Up no I've been through some Temptations some trials myself I've been through a few I've been through some very difficult moments some very dark hours but I refuse to stay there I'm not going to sit around in mourn and mourn and cry and mourn and mourn and cry why would I do that I got a job to do I've got responsibility and besides that every time that it comes upon me something on the inside and bless it out it blows away that morning and there comes a rejoicing in a joy and a Thanksgiving to God I know I spent a lot of time already on missions but I want you to know that he said in Ezekiel I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit and then he said I'll put my spirit in you brother Branham shows that the new heart is on your only your intellects and it's a new way of thinking it's God enlarging the mind and starting to make the word of God be believable Jesus talks and said to Nicodemus said you know you hear you are a man of the scripture and you don't know these things well Ezekiel prophesied and said I'll tell you what I'm going to do with Israel there'll come a time they'll get a new birth and when they do I'm going to give them a new heart and I'm going to give them a new spirit but I'm going to do more than that I'm going to do what I couldn't do in the Old Testament I'm going to give them my spirit you say well why couldn't it well yes he could anoint Moses he could anoint in that sense be filled with the spirit but not like the New Testament because under the old Covenant there they were there under the blood and bulls and goats and it would not take away sin and it could not deal with sin nature because the life of the sacrifice could not come back upon the believer it was the animal but that day on Calvary things changed a New Covenant was written and God gave his own Holy Spirit the life of the Lamb of God to come Amen to take away your sin and to dwell within you and give you that overcoming power so they couldn't live right so they were given laws with threats if you do this you're stoned if you commit adultery we'll take you out if you bear false witness I will we'll Stone you with stone hey good you and your whole family will die for take another sacred things you took of the tithe that was to belong to only to God holy to God and you use them for yourself because that was the first fruits given of the land and it was all declared holy but you know when you get a new heart that's the intellect you think with it's a new way of thinking you know the Bible looks to be reasonable I didn't used to believe it that way and it's reasonable I I I I I believe it now I I want to accept Christ I don't want to go to hell I do realize the Bible said there's a a hell to shun and I don't want to go there well you know this was Billy Graham the only thing Billy Graham could give was a new heart a new way of thinking so this was him and his Revival and he would invite a rock star or ball star a movie star to come up give a testimony of how Christ had changed their lives and then he would preach and the spirit of God would move using that simple message and thousands would flock to his altars haven't received a new heart a new thinking oh the word of God is reasonable you know I don't want to go to hell I I want to make Heaven my home and if a rock star and a movie star or a ball star or bigwig thinks it's cool and the right thing to do you know I'll become a Christian too it's chick it's the thing but I tell you the holy spirit is not a new thought but it will give you a new thinking it'll change your thoughts you see a new thought we can we bring that same concept there's many many sitting on message pews that are just Billy Graham converts easy believism you see that that that that it just got as far as locked who buy the skin of his teeth get out of Sodom you see a new thought why you must have your thoughts changed why God's doing wonderful things he sent a prophet I believe that our seals are open I believe it serpent seed makes sense what is God doing he's God's giving you a new heart amen it's necessary that's what said God said I will give you a new heart and and then so we give them knowledge a new the intellect knowledge and they receive it but that's only the new heart let me tell you if you stop there you're not fully converted you'll wind up in the tribulation you're not going to Rapture without the token are you with me without the Holy Ghost this is what Billy Graham did he gave people knowledge that Jesus loved them that he died for them and they accept that knowledge and they believe it but what do they have a new heart you know what God provided the lamb brother Brandon said that's intellectual Faith that's what's matter with our revivals today whether that's how here's how they get it um here's how it is now get it Billy Graham Jack Schuler that was a Methodist man Mia a great man Oral Roberts the great evangelists on the field has come this nation back and forth and altered calls have been made to enough to convert a thousand Americas and the reason but the reason it's only the people that are brought to a intellectual faith they would go a little deeper till that Faith come from the intellectuals and soak down in the soul it would last and that's the reason about 80 percent or 90 percent of the converts that comes in Revival is gone before six months is because they only have an intellectual conception but when it becomes an experience of being born again of the spirit of God that anchors to Eternity and I want to say that's the intellectual side of the message now it's a new heart and certainly it's wonderful that the word of God is believable and that we gain understanding of the great Mysteries but still that isn't it Parkinson's would say though I understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and yet not have charity or love that basic element of God's nature that comes by the Holy Ghost I am nothing believe in the message is not enough believe in the seals are open the great Mysteries is still you can do that with just a new heart your thinking's changed you're still not safe from the hounds of hell no no it'll come in your house with television Hollywood dress makeup pornography sometimes drugs and alcohol slothful lazy lives no desperation no sincerity no dedication Galloping down every movie that comes along and and there it is is because it and it shows it shows that The Thirst has not been satisfied brother Bradham warned us said apply a church apply the token don't fail don't take no chance it won't work children you must have the token you say I believe yes I go yeah I believe the message that's all that's right and that's good but you must have the tokens you hear Brandon Tabernacle you must have the token displayed without it all your listening or believing is in vain you live a good life you listen to what the word says you go to church you try to live right that's fine but that's not it when I see the blood that's the token so he said don't just come this far and say I believe the message you obey the messenger coming to Christ well I believe everywhere brother Brown that's good but that's just being able to read take the message take it into your heart that you must have the token the very light that was in Christ being you don't make this hard the token is the Holy Ghost you must have the Holy Ghost and when I see that I will pass over you Ah that's the side now here's the other side the pendulum swings this way I'll give you a new spirit the new spirit is not the Holy Ghost that's when the seed of your emotions get cleaned up and makes you shouting down hello somebody amen emotion won't do it amen you know you you know an old man the old man Pentecostal man told Brother about time he said brother brother butts if you don't have joy just jump till you get it you jump all you want to yeah I don't give you Joy you don't jump to get joy you have joy and you jump come on I don't jump to get a million dollars and so I'm working for it amen and listen Grace is something you don't work for we're not working to get it but when we get it hallelujah it's something to shout about [Applause] and people make to make the mistake they'll come in a prayer line the first thing to do is start jumping and they ain't got nothing yet and they jump through the prayer line and jump right out of it and jump back to their seat and um next survival they gotta jump again my brother Tim why why would you bring something like this up we love to jump well hey I'd love for you to jump I'd love for you to shout I love for you to run the aisles but I mean you know don't let it just become a farm that this is just what we do with evening light Tabernacle amen this is a custom if it is your drink drinking from a stagnated stream amen do it because it's something bubbling up on the inside of you and it's giant speakable and it's full of Glory and really I believe that's why most of you shout and jump and and rejoice but you have people sometimes that they think that's what you got to do listen what you've got to do is meet the person of Jesus Christ amen amen something that takes over every fighter of your being amen something that makes you on the inside change from the inside out and makes you love the Lord with all your heart with all your soul with all your being you see you can take a substitute of an intellectual Faith or you can take a substitute of emotion but until that genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost satisfies every fiber and longing in a human soul there's people that actually live on emotion you know that that was the Pentecostal side this is a movement many of them you know they you know always you know it's clapping their hands and playing the music and patting their feet and you know and then and it's all by the music you know and a work up and it just becomes a habit and he let it stop and bucket of the water pours over them see and it's just become accustomed see it's a form of godliness and yet lacks the power of a living God that brings a changed life amen that's why it ain't about you jump into somebody you're living different it ain't about how you can explain to me the seals that's living different it ain't about you having all the knowledge you're having all the gifts is living different we want to see that life life-giving water bubbling out of your life thirsting for a living God until ever Fiverr now you might speak in tongues you might dance you might not you may shout I you know you amen you're going to shout I said you're going to shout you're going to have to do something amen because job said amen back there he said God said I saw you shouting Hallelujah the children of God shout because there's a victory in their life they shout because God is that healer they shout because the Lost comes to Christ they shout we are here in time doing what he saw us do in eternity you know there again you don't want it just the emotional side where you just have church religion and you get out next day is well are you a Christian well I don't know did you are you I don't know are you are you I'll tell you what because the emotion's gone it only lasted for a moment you want the River of Life down on the inside of you that what are your work or whether you're at school or whether I know it'll work in school come on you say it won't work there among the unbelievably it will I went to school with spoken word books under my arms I went to school as a living testimony I went to school with Joey unspeakable and full of glory and sharing it with my classmates it'll work in school it'll work on your job it works everywhere God wants you to take something Beyond just an impersonation of Christianity into a hidden life with Christ for the world and sin is cut off so he says I will put my spirit in you now I give you a new heart I've taught you how to be baptized I give you a new heart the seals are open the Mysteries are revealed the truth said the word serpent seed and Jesus loves you all of those things are yours new heart I give you a new spirit a motion shouting Jolly unspeakable but what I want to do is I also want to put within you he said my spirit and when I put my spirit in you it will cause you to walk in my stretches and you shall keep in my judgment and not only that but you will dwell in the land and that's what we want to do we want to dwell in the land of the Bible in the land of Truth now as we go into this I'm going to skip a bunch of things because I'm already holding you along with everything else this water is an endless supply and the bread has it goes in revelation 22 17 and the spirit of the Bride say come and let him that heareth come and let him that as a thirst come and whosoever will let him take on the Water of Life freely Jesus said he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst this is his promise this is promised to us as believers now We Come to the River The Living Waters it's more than a substitute it's not a stagnant cistern of something they had many many years ago and now stinks and breeds wiggle tails and gut bugs in it it's not one that's broken and dry it's a Fountain of Living Water it's more than a pardon me from sin you know many people will accept Jesus as their savior to pay their debt let's suppose that you had this enormous debt you couldn't pay and we did all of us and you have a note for your house and you've refinance it and you've tried to pay it and you can't pay it and and now it's in thousands of dollars a month and you're grinding away You're sweating ever sweat to try them you have to pay that and your car's in Hawk you don't own any money or anything you can't hardly rub two nickels together everything is terrible because you have such a debt and you can't pay it you know how it is you ever had a creditor call you thankfully the Lord's always helping me not to ever be in debt but you know others you know you know how these creditors are calling answer the phone without and you you know they're hounding you and and really you can't answer the phone without thinking who is that going to call am I gonna get a threatening phone call you know they they're going to tell me now oh oh oh oh they're going to repossess my house tomorrow they're going to take my car I won't have a way to work now what am I going to do or you get a letter in the mail saying we're cutting off your lights we're taking away your home we're repossessing your car and you become Hunted pay this debt or we'll take your soul down to prison you'll burn in a lake of fire we're coming after your soul and the man's working and he's paying you he's trying to do this and trying to do better I'll I'll pay you Monday I I'll pay you next week I get paid and I I'll send the payment and you're trying to pay the debt off and finally some man comes along and I say he's a billionaire and he's so rich and comes along and he pays your dad so I want to do something for you I'd like to pay your house off I'm going to pay your car off bring me all your bills oh my they're going to cut my lights off tomorrow bring your bills they shutting your water bring your bills everything that you owe those bills that you you owed the hardware store and you can't show your face there the lumber company trying to make some money and you know all of that this man says I'm gonna pay it off pay it all off bring it to me you owe it I'm paying it I'm gladly paying it for you I I've got the resources I've got the ability I'm gonna write out a check for every one of these and I'm going to pay your debt well I'll tell you what all of a sudden you'd have peace all of a sudden you could sleep at night you know all of a sudden there would be emotion that would be tears that would even be some shouting going on amen that would be rejoice and my dad just got paid my dad is paid here I wasn't hot here I was in trouble and this friend of mine this rich man yeah I tell you my debt's been paid there's been a weight lifted off of my shoulders you could go skipping down the streets and meeting everybody shaking their hands or even look at everybody it don't matter if it's a former creditor he's paying you're not hiding nowhere you're not afraid to take a phone call you're not checking your emails for threatening letter you're getting you you know you you know it's all paid and you can go and make a new life now let this sink in and you can even go and make new debts even though that the one pager death became your savior to save you from loss you stood still wouldn't have his life or his nature and there are many people that say God save me from my sins and I've accepted Jesus as my savior they feel emotion and there's a big burden lifted and they go back and make more sin depth because the life and the nature and the character of the Dead payer has never came into their life and that's what's lacking in the Christian world today they've accepted Christ as their savior they washed the robes in the blood of the Lamb they've done works of sanctification but they lack his life and that's why the spiritual life is stagnant there's no outflow of the Holy Ghost you have to become Living Waters he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his innermost being to flow rivers of Living Water what's the matter today as I bring this down to clothes and we try to bring it close what's all wrong with so many churches in the land today so many people what is clogging up the blessings we accept the Theology of the blood as a sub as a substitute and not born of its life to become a son of God Christ's blood is to be more than a substitute he is our sin offering he surely paid our debt but in this glorious Covenant there's more than just receiving money from the rich man amen but it's real you can receive the life of that rich man the kinsman redeemer who was not only Rich enough to pay your debt but the debt of every man in the world and then he'll take your depths and put him in the sea of his forgetfulness and make you Son of God a son or God and where you have the little life of Jesus Christ that returns back upon you as a believer you'll have the rich man living on the inside of you and out of his riches will be Abundant Life and it will not be a patch of life or a turning of a new Leaf for making a pledge but a new creation but the only way you can do that is for the old dead pen man and death to die that old sin nature has to die we don't live in you no more that one that made you a Slave that put you in debt that ran up your bill and the one who has all the riches of Eternity sit on the throne of your heart be in filled with divine nature if you can't stay out of debt you might have had since past forgiven but only when that man Christ Jesus comes in can you have the life to live an overcoming life now as I'm closing let the musicians come was a man he had struck it rich you've been out he was a gold miner and he got a good claim he had sackfuls of gold heavy heavy as he packed him there back toward town and he's thinking when I get to town when I get back to the city I'm gonna be rich I'm going to live it up all my hard work will be over my troubles everything else I'm going to live it I'm going to live it up and he sat by his campfire on the way home that night trying to sleep his dog begins to bark shut up shut up tomorrow I'm going to be rich tomorrow I'll be wealthy tomorrow I'll have everything I've got this gold and I get it and cash it in put it in the bank and I can draw I'll have it shut up don't the dog box again I said shut up quit barking I'm rich don't you know now I'm Mr so-and-so I was a poor old man but now I'm wealthy I'm going home I'm going to town I'm gonna Live It Up he lays back down the dog box again I don't need no dog what I need a dog I'm rich why do I need that he drew his gun and shot the dog killed it lay back down to sleep and while he's sleeping what the dog was warning him about was someone who'd been on his Trail and was coming up close and he shot the voice that was worn in him and he paid the consequences with his life what am I trying to say don't shoot the voice Don't Stop The Voice I'm trying to tell you he's slipping up on you want you to Bow your heads he's slipping up on you he's coming your way it's not a dog it's the Holy Spirit and we're trying to reach the world right now I'm trying to reach you [Music] don't keep trying to Hush The Voice even you as a Christian don't try to Hush The Voice of the Holy Spirit trying to tell you there's more there's more I want you to ask God right now [Music] because he would lead me to speak on this maybe you'd like to stand to your feet and say brother Tim I want to heed that voice this morning let me hear what he says today if you will hear his voice and Harden not your heart as in the provocation [Music] come unto me ye that are heavy laden and I will give you rest why don't you listen to him this morning he knocks on your door he speaks to you you're a sinner away from God there's no better time to come to him right now right with all your heart everything that's within you you're thirsting for a living God you've seen and know there's a living God he heals our cancers he cast out Devils he he heals diseases he saves the Lost he's here to save you this morning once you stand to your feet right now and to say I want to know that Living God I want to know that Living God amen I want to know him I want to know him maybe you want to stand with these and say Lord this is what I want maybe you there the Holy Spirit has been speaking to you today you you're still trying to satisfy that thirst with other things and you find out there's only one thing that can answer the soul desire and you want to come to him with all your heart so I want to be a real Christian brother Tim I didn't come in this just to be a halfway believer I want to be everything I want to be surrendered Lord search me o God right now cleanse me Lord every Wicked way of my life or that don't let me just turn a new Leaf or make a little new vow but oh God let me start right now you know I think of a man the other day read his Bible do I just buried brother Kenneth 55

Rapture are you really ready to go home or you really may have a surrendered life have you really dedicated yourself it's a consecration really there inviting invite him in your heart amen oh Jesus today as we bow before you Lord just a moment in your presence I pray oh God as we reach toward you that you'll just speak to the hearts you reveal yourself to every person that you'll deal with them and only on the ways that you can pray Lord if they're in debt today you'll pay their debts said come to me you that are heavy laden and I will give you rest I pray o God that you'll do it do it father in Jesus name and they laid they're all at the altar hey they make a full surrender I pray Lord for those that are they're Christians today but somehow their pipe the flow has been clogged up

something clog the flow has it been there when I when I got involved in all of that stuff of the world and Lord they put whatever name to it whatever it is that is I pray today they'll take the rod of
